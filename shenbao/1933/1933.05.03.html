<h3>紀念五三任</h3>
<p>今日爲「五三」濟南慘案第五週年紀念。「五三」慘案之發生。爲由於我國革命勢力之伸張北洋軍閥旣都次第傾覆同時帝國主義者在華勢力。亦發生動摇故日帝國主義者於國民革命軍第二次北伐進展至山東之際。即不惜悍然揭露其侵略之眞面目藉以「保僑。」公然二次出兵山東爲軍閥暗中之援助。并阻撓革命勢力之進展。同時實行佔領濟南轟射屠殺横肆荼毒。在此一頁悲慘恥辱之歷史中。吾人蓋可以明白看出帝國主義欲維護其在殖民地之利益。必出其全力以鎭壓殖民地之革命勢力。而扶植其舊有勢力。「五三」慘變之發生。亦即此一侵略政策之實行。</p>
<p>「五三」在今日恰爲五週年。則吾人過去紀念「五三」。亦已四次。過去四次所以紀念「五三」者。果爲何物。物血涙。爲嘆息。爲無謂之呻吟。爲徒然之憤怒。然而舊的「五三」之恥辱。旣絲毫未能洗去。新的國恥則賡續展開。九一八以來。我民族所蒙受之恥辱更十倍百倍於「五三」。日帝國主義者對我之壓迫與蹂躏。亦十倍百倍於「五三」。舊創未平。新創又復遍體。則吾人今日紀念「五三」。果仍將如過去四次之照例紀念」乎。果仍將痛哭流涙再作一次往事之憑弔乎。</p>
<p>吾人以爲在今日紀念「五三」。其意義實較諸曩昔尤爲重大。第一由於資本主義經濟恐慌之激盪。帝國主義者爲掙扎其殘喘。其對於殖民地與半殖民地。不僅爲鎭壓其革命勢力。扶植其舊有勢力。且進而要求殖民地之重新分割。於是爲遠東問題中心之我國。乃恰爲世界所環抱。而處於至爲艱難至爲危殆之境地。第二。自九一八以來。日帝國主義者對我侵略步步加緊。而我舉國上下。尙未能積極與之抗爭。敵之慾望無窮。我之沉夢方酣。此又不啻表示我民族。今日已消失其維護生存之能力。而甘心坐受宰割也者。故今日横梗於吾人眼前之實際問題。乃爲如何反抗日帝國主義之侵略。如何爭取我民族之生存自由。</p>
<p>總之在今日情勢之下。吾人欲洗滌過去之恥辱。惟有抗爭。欲維護民族之生存。亦惟有「抗爭」惟抗爭乃足以紀念過去之「五三」。亦惟抗爭乃足以阻遏新的國恥之賡續展開否則紀念奚爲者無。謂之呻吟又奚爲者。</p>

<p>邊界俄稅關員開始撤回</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）因中東路而起之俄「滿」糾紛、現愈趨嚴重化、蘇俄已宣佈不退還撤入俄境之車輛、而滿洲里及綏芬河之蘇俄稅關人員、已撤入俄境、蘇俄飛機現沿邊界地帶極形活動、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）據滿洲里邊界守衛隊之報告、日來有蘇俄軍用飛機兩架飛翔於邊境地帶、此爲一九二九年中俄戰事以來俄機飛近邊境之第一次、於此足見俄「滿」形勢之嚴重云（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄與僞組織對於中東路所有權及經營鐡路之爭執、今日自接僞組織否認蘇聯單獨所有權之正式報告後、　益尖銳化、今日蘇俄政府發表該路俄代表與僞當道交涉續訊、並聲稱業已訓令俄方代表堅持立即回復常狀、及恪遵北京與瀋陽兩協定、蓋蘇俄此時按照兩協定、要求該路之完全所有權、故今日所發表之雙方在哈埠交換照會、曾有一文指蘇俄將若干機車開入俄境、爲違法片面行動、但本日俄政府已不復在公報内辯論車輛所有權、聲稱、中俄與奉俄兩協定、切實承認中東路爲蘇俄財産、故規定中國在某項條件下可以購回該路、此乃中國承認該路所有權屬於俄國之明證、「滿洲國官吏之干涉」係屬違犯條約、至俄政府此時所要求者、乃立即締結經營該路之技術協定而已、此外俄政府又表示、倘「滿洲國」再有對於該路所有權之要求、蘇俄將不再理會云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄與「滿洲國」間之嚴重衝突、未有解决氣象、中東路僞理事長李紹庚致俄總辦柯士尼作夫函、否認蘇俄對於中東路享有所有權、柯覆稱、蘇俄所有權、載見於瀋陽與北平所簽定兩條約之條文中、今（滿洲國）忽提出蘇俄所有權之問題、使人發生「滿洲國一目的在破壞此兩約之惶恐云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本當道雖對蘇俄與「僞國」間中東鐡路爭端、作冷淡之態、並仍稱此案不致有重大之發展、但據報載長春消息、該處當道以爲此項爭端須由蘇俄允將一九二四年瀋陽協定取銷、另訂新約、始能解决、新約必須具平等條欵云、蘇俄政府致長春之第二抗議、責「俄滿國」違背瀋陽協定、「僞滿國」政府則稱、「滿洲國」並無違背情事、因該協定乃由前政府簽定、而蘇俄政府乃利用前政府之荏弱以成之也、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（大連）柯士尼作夫以關於中東路之第三次覆函致李紹庚後、「僞滿國」政府决、議堵絶綏芬河之運輸、致人心大爲緊張柯氏函中仍堅稱中東路乃蘇俄所有、「僞滿國」政府宣稱、蘇俄之覆函、使和平解决爲不可能云、又據傳稱、四月二十三日有蘇俄飛機兩架侵入滿境、飛於距俄滿邊界約十五哩之平陽鎭天空、此事亦使人心爲之不安、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>土日商約延長有效三個月</p>

<p>（倫敦）商部大臣任錫曼交由駐英日大使松平向日本提出英日實業家會集倫敦討論兩國間商業之建議、孟却斯德棉布業中人有以愼重態度贊成此議者、希望藉此改善英國棉布業所受日貨劇烈競爭之地位、亦有反對此議者、因此不啻承認英國之荏弱、反對者主張提高日貨入英帝國之稅率、孟却斯德皇家交易所准棉貨同盟會之請求、由交易所會員簽名上書政府、請禁外國在英帝國各市塲開拓其商業、此實空前之舉、蘭開夏之恐慌、於此可見一斑、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）因英國取消日印商約、松平駐英日使奉内田外長之命、與英政府當局接洽數次、英商部大臣任錫曼對日使提議協定市塲、松平即電日外部請示、英國提案大綱如次、（一）取消印日商約與印度産業、保護法所關事宜、應從全局商議、設法補救、局部磋商無補於事、（二）英國欲藉此機、把英國全屬地與世界市塲上、英日兩國商品所競爭北方爲磋商範團、共同研究息爭方法、成立全盤之協定、（三）欲達到此種目的、英國政府切望兩國間各任命委員、或由兩國工業家組織共同息爭委員會、解决兩國之經濟衝突、協定市場、各不侵犯其利益、日外交部接到此項報告、即轉達商工省、商工工省將召開經濟界代表會議、决定對策、日外交部對此提案、在原則上已表示接受、（一日華聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）關於英商相提案、日實業界雖未經過討論、其意見及預測大略如左、（一）英國提案雖不失爲衝破僵局之一種辦法、不過其居心尙難預測、或將爲避開討論印日通商之手叚、（二）問題現時發生於印度、竟以全英屬及世界布塲協定爲其範圍、可證英國之屬地、對日貨將一律取進攻政策、無論如何了結、英屬之日貨進口將受其影響、（三）南洋與中國之市塲、英國所以列爲磋商範圍、其意在要求日貨退出英屬之交換條件、日本毫無所得、日實業界謂磋商不得其法、恐因此引起英日之全面抗爭、故日方應審愼研究對付辦法云、（二日華聯電）</p>

<p>日軍專恃大砲猛攻</p>
<p>我官兵則冒彈前進</p>
<p>石匣通訊、敵軍自四月二十一晨開始攻擊我南天門陣地以來、迄今數日、我神勇之官兵、浴血死鬥、數千民族英雄、已完成茯使命、而歸樂土、敵則已以極鉅大之代價、尙不能換得南天門之寸地、現正檄調援軍、圖謀再舉、料不日當有更劇烈之戰爭、茲據黄杰部連長林君所談數日來戰事、詳誌如次、</p>
<p>二十一日、正晨光熹微之際、我陣地空中、忽來敵機六七架、上下迥翔、盤旋不去、敵軍砲兵、便以之爲目標、集中火力、作猛烈之射擊、同時蒙僞日軍二千餘人、亦在其砲火掩護之下、向我南天門及八道樓子一帶進攻、而其目標、尤側重於左翼八道樓子陣地、蓋該地比南天門高出一部、至爲險要也、此時我守兵在此處者僅一營、經數小時鬥爭之後、陣地已被轟平、傷亡亦且過半、但我官兵壛皆沉着　敵、雖死至最後一人、尙不肯退、受傷倒地者、亦仍極力掙扎、爬行而前、直至　蹶乃止、某排長受傷、以一上士代之、全排爲日兵包圍、衝戰三晝夜、仍率二十餘人突圍而出、回營報命、我官兵之神勇及其誓死爲國之决心、於此可見、而該營亦已傷亡殆　矣、八道樓遂一度淪陷敵手、斯時我援軍雖已馳集、但終以敵軍砲火過猛、只得暫時扼守附近高地、是晚八時、黄杰師長乃利用黑夜、下令反攻、我忠勇之官兵、冒彈前進、敵則仍驅蒙僞兩軍於前、而以機槍大砲督戰於後、當日僞兩軍與我接觸時、日軍不分彼此、集中其火力向戰線上轟擊掃射、蓋其企圖、不獨在消滅我軍、且欲一舉消滅僞軍、於此可見日寇之狡毒與僞軍之可憐可恨矣、斯役我軍傷亡雖多、敵則更倍於我、而八道樓子陣地、經一夜之苦鬥、終爲我軍收復、二十二日、敵更以一部千餘人、向我左翼迂迴、情勢至爲危急黄師長乃親率第八團全團跑步上前、迎頭痛擊、敵計復未得逞、我乃乘此時機、急行進攻、烟霧迷天、殺聲震野、敵軍皆恐惶失措、受創而沈、二十四日、敵又以更大之兵力、計蒙僞日軍數千人、分數路向我進攻、戰鬥更爲慘烈、但我軍官兵、仍一本其愛國之熱忱、誓與陣地共存亡、今後日方將更以如何重大之犧牲、冀奪我南天門之陣地尙非現在所能估計也、</p>
<p>此次戰役、敵之砲火發揮效力最大、只八道樓子陣地一處、便巳着彈三千餘顆、不只戰地被其轟平、即磗石亦成粉碎、故我犧牲極鉅、計陣亡營長二員、傷三員、官兵受傷者二千餘人、敵則因取攻勢、傷亡更倍於我、又敵軍飛機在此次戰中所發揮之威力甚微、殊無足畏、當我黄師長率全團跑步前進向迂迴我左翼之敵迎擊時、敵機十數架、追隨擲彈、但我軍則竟無一損傷者云云、（四月二十八日）</p>

<p>市府以不破壞我主權爲原則</p>
<p>公共租界工部局藉納稅西人特别大會時、擅自修改洋涇浜章程附則第三十四條、圖取租界工廠檢查權、本市市政府除已發表聲明堅持力爭外、並於上月二十六日、向各國駐滬總領事提出抗議、本市納稅華人會·市民聯合會·及各國貨工廠團體等均願爲政府後盾、以維主權、日來實業部及市政府、對於辦理此案、正積極研究進行辦法、工部局總裁費信惇曾於上星期六、往訪市府秘書長俞鴻鈞、探詢我方意見、領事團領袖美領事克銀漢、亦昨昨日上午十時、至市府拜訪吳市長、對此事交換意見、詳情如次、</p>

<p>會談内容</p>
<p>克銀漢氏之訪問吳市長、首先聲述市府之抗議、領團方面業已收到、惟尙未開會討論此項問題、繼即探詢市府對於此項問題之態、是否有和平解决之可能、吳市長當謂、關於檢查工廠問題、市政府首曾發表聲明、繼向領團抗議、態度已甚明顯、檢查工廠、爲中國政府整個勞工行政之權、市府决不放棄、爲全市勞工之幸福計、市府决斷然實行、惟在不背中央命令原則之下、市府仍願竭誠與租界當局磋商妥痒解决之辦法、深望領團囑工部局明瞭此意、以達檢查工廠之目的、克銀漢氏旋詢吳市長以外商註册問題、吳市長乃告以外商如不向實業部註册、在法律上不能取得法人之地位、如有糾紛發生、不能以公司之名義提起訴訟、</p>
<p>解决途徑</p>
<p>公共租界工部局總裁費信惇氏、亦曾於上星期六往訪俞秘書長、探詢市府對於檢查工廠之態度、俞秘書長當告以在不背中央命令原則之下、市府仍願與租界當局開誠磋商解决辦法、據僑滬多年而熟悉租界情形之某外人談、關於此事、市府與租界當忆之間、當可商得一妥善之解决辦法、中國政府檢查租界内之工廠、係屬整個勞工行政之權、租界當忆實無理由可以反對、租界當局濫事擴充權限、乃屬非法、是故中國政府檢查租界内之工廠、將來當可達到目的、</p>

<p>昨日到會者有劉湛恩·郭秉文·鄒秉文·林康侯·黎照賓·陳立廷陳蔗靑·梁十純·全紹武·查良釗·等十餘人、由劉湛恩主席、先由梁十純報告國際情形、</p>
<p>國際情形</p>
<p>梁十純氏起立報告、先　述赴美經過後、繼談美國對中日情形云、美國朝野、對中日問題、俱對我表同情、常竭力主張公道、惟我國人民、往往以倚賴性深、希望各國以不可能之辦法援我、如欲促美國對日宣戰或經濟絶交等、此實大誤、美國對我同情、於國聯大會盡力主持公道、卒使十九國委員會報告書通過、此爲事實問題、當國聯大會舉行之初、法國固然素抱袒日態度、復有英代表西門參加袒日、致一度國聯空氣、對我十分不利、同時日人在一時期卽羅斯福當選之後、未就職之前、竭力宣傳、謂羅斯福就職後第一政策、將取消史汀生政策、亦卽取消不承認滿洲國之宣言、經此宣傳、國聯益覺無能爲力、詎史汀生抱定宗旨、相與羅斯福會晤後、後於英方切實談判、以戰債交涉、爲中日問題公道主張之條件、經此努力、十九國委員會報告書始得通過、然國際間對我表同情、所能爲者在目前止此而已、欲求得外交上更大勝利、要在我國自己努力、此次如美國承認蘇俄問題、日人對此非常恐慌、竭力製造空氣、企圖破壞、然而羅斯福總統早經决定、實行承認、祗係時間問題耳、吾人在國外最感困難厥惟國内消息之不靈通、無論政府方面或人民方面、處處落人之後、此則影響於外交極大云云、</p>
<p>抗日戰况</p>
<p>據查良釗全紹武二氏報告長城各口戰况、迭次在喜峯口冷口古北口灤東等處、會晤抗日各軍領袖、如宋哲元·馮治安·關麟徴、徐庭瑶·商震·傳作義·等各將領、俱表示願與敵軍一拚、對克復失地、亦頗能自信、惟因限於命令、無法自動、致此戰彼息、遭敵軍流通兵力、各個擊破、且敵軍械器犀利、以數十里之遥、晝夜開放排砲、及飛機轟炸、致我方束手無策、否則如能統制各軍、下一絶大决心、同時反攻、短兵相接、敵軍在必敗之例、宋哲元反攻喜峯口之勝利、實爲先例、視察所得、拉雜報告、應由人民督促政府早日抱定决心、澈底抵抗云云、</p>
<p>提議一斑</p>

<p>房産會三通告</p>
<p>注意水價詢問地價</p>
<p>上海房産公會、昨爲注意自來水用表計費辦渎及勸告房客勿浪用自來水事、並工部局新估地價事、發出通告三件、分錄如下、</p>
<p>注意自來水價</p>
<p>函告會員逕啓者、茲將本年四月一日起、試用之水表計算水費辦法、送請台閱照行、惟須（一）注意水表之數目、（二）注意用戶之浪費、（三）注意水管之滲漏、（四）應作用水數量之統計、如每宅用水人數、房租若干、每天平均每人用水若干、得有此種統計、專爲證明現在所限得用之水量、是否足供必須之使用、並且證明在某數量以上、方得稱爲浪費、俾便工部局用水委員會有所根據、討論修改、以協助水公司獲得合理而切實可行之水價、再房租應以凈數爲標準、以計算水費、因此爲工部局給與水公司特許合同内所規定也、此請公綏、</p>
<p>敬告房客</p>
<p>查公共租界内自來水、　　裝用水表、計算水費之後、每月水費驟高、甚有比前多出八九倍者、業主方面、知此鉅額水費、用水者必無力擔負、經數個月之爭論、工部局與水公司均認識事實、幡然改計、業於四月一日起施行試騐辦法、視房租之高下、規定得用水量之多寡、水費價格之等級、例如十元以下之房租、每月得用自來水三千五百加侖、每千加侖銀元一角七分一釐、在此得用水量之下、水費包在房租内者、用戶不須付費、超過得用之水量、則每千加侖之水費、應爲一角七分一釐、須由用戶負擔、餘則以此類推、須知用表計算水費、點滴之水、均須付錢、假使浪費、在他人無所損失、在自身多擔費用、不過房租低廉之水價、工部局與水公司、爲調劑社會經濟、與優待貧苦小戶起見、實在成本之下、如果浪費、使水公司吃虧過甚、亦所不許、所以爲水公司私計、務請節制浪費爲荷、特此通告、</p>
<p>函詢新估地價</p>
<p>該會昨又分函各會員業主各經租賬房云、逕啓者、查公共租界工部局、近來又將地價新估、業經第二十五次會員常會議决、凡以爲新估地價過高者、可於接到通知書三十日内、向工部局提出抗議、等因在案、相應函請查照爲荷、</p>

<p>掉頭肇禍</p>
<p>二馬路德商美最時洋行福而特號、昨日自日本來滬、於下午四時五十分進口、當即於六時零二分、開至陸家嘴、浦面掉頭、駛往公和祥碼頭停泊、其時適有日商上海運輸公司之小火輪春丸、由大阪碼頭駛回五馬路外江面停泊、行經該處、見德輪在該處掉頭、業巳駛直、乃即開車向南、不意駛至德輪後梢時、忽然大輪機葉發動、該輪船巨力大、小輪遂被浪激向西岸靠去、該處爲北京路外灘十五號碼頭、碼頭旁靠有鐡駁四艘、當春丸小輪被激靠該碼頭時、致撞於泰美五號鐡駁後梢、小輪旋即下沉因該處水淺、故七時許記者往出事處察看時、見小輪之蓬帳、尙浮在水面、</p>
<p>一人落水</p>
<p>當小輪被激與泰</p>
<p>美五號鐡駁後梢</p>
<p>撞碰時、適有該鐡駁燒飯之小孩（約十六七歲）立大後梢、被猛撞擊落下水、因潮流甚急、無法撈救、致遭溺斃、屍身尙無下落、小輪上共有六人、當與鐡駁撞碰時、即一躍登上鐡駁、故無一傷害、出事後、水巡房得悉、遂派警至出事處察看並將小輪老大瞿章大本地人、帶往駐船詢問、　　進行交涉</p>
<p>出事後、小輪老大、即報告公司、公司即派員至外灘察看、並畫圖樣、以爲交涉證據、小輪昨夜仍沉於江底、須今日通知美最時、由雙方會同察看後、再施行打撈、</p>

<p>未來世界大戰之趨勢</p>
<p>丨本埠陸陞君來信丨</p>
<p>記者先生：自從德國國社黨執政以來，一方强力地壓制共黨的公開活動，另方面積極地和法國針鋒相向，歐洲政局，忽呈萬分緊張，於是有英首相親赴意大利，口頭上以新裁軍會議爲出馬美名，實質上是討論到一般重要問题，隨後英意兩總揆的叙談結果，産生出一個歐洲四强合作。</p>
<p>原先我們觀察入旬日以來的世界政局，正如申報時評乃君所說：第二次大戰之方式，將爲帝國主義間之衝突，而非爲帝國主義聯合一致反蘇聯之鬥爭；但大戰爆發的前夜，正是政局變化最迅易的時候。我底意見，第二次大戰之方式，不能就决定將爲帝國主義間之衝突；換句話講；卽各帝國主義者聯合進攻蘇聯的危機，並未稍减。不特未曾稍减，而且益增尖銳；最好的例證：是最近英蘇因蘇俄當局的處置英工程師事件；引起英當局强烈的反應；和意德法西斯黨對共黨的嚴厲壓制，接着有蘇聯對希脫拉的提起抗議；還有數日前，日产國主義者允許白俄在所謂「滿」蘇兩國交界處，有白俄的政治組織；况且在歐西方面反蘇聯的領導者，已由法國轉入英帝國的手中，而這次英首相所親訪的人物，適是　墨索里尼，他倆叙談的結果；是怎樣使歐洲四列强合作：旣然我們知道帝國主義者相互之間因利害的衝突，决計沒法合作的；而墨索里尼難道就不知道這點嗎？事實的眞實性可說是這樣，當各帝國主義者相互間的衝突到尖銳的時候，常有一個什麽非戰公約呀，什麽和平會議呀，一方固在謀取各帝國主義者相互間的暫時的緩和空氣，同時也祗有向共同的敵人進攻時，才求得相互間的合作，此墨索里尼所倡議的歐洲四列强合作，其作用也不外乎欲緩和四强間的劍拔弩張的緊張空氣，另方面積極地聯合起來向他們的同一敵人　蘇聯進攻！</p>
<p>記者先生，因爲我沒法直接和乃君討論這個問題，故聊書一二尙请答覆我這個意見，到底如何？</p>
<p>答：足下來信不贊成本報乃君三月二十日的時評對於世界戰爭的形勢丨「第二次大戰之方式·將爲帝國主義間之衝突而非爲帝國主義聯合一致反蘇聯之鬥爭」丨的估量·主張「各帝國主義者聯合進攻蘇聯的危機並未稍滅」。這一問題非常嚴重，而國人對於此一問題之兩種主張各有其懷抱，即各有幻想，若不詳細討論，認淸國際情勢發展的前途，决定我們中華民衆應取之態度與應付將來大事變之準備，那實在大大地危險，應該鄭重提出請讀者大衆與以充分的注意，加以嚴密的討論。記者之愚，以爲討論這一問題，不應專從國際間某一孤零的事項，某一外交上的事件或一種形式上的變化做標準，而應注意以下幾件事實：（一）就國際帝國主義者的階級本能說，他們是時時刻刻在企圖進攻蘇聯，因爲「臥榻之側」蹲着一個足以致他們死命的東西，就是說，世界上有了蘇聯的社會主義聯邦之另一新的東西，時時足以引起世界上一般民衆對於舊社會（資本主義社會）的懷疑，而與各帝國主義者以打擊；（二）對蘇聯聯合進攻，消滅社會主義聯邦，這一戰爭東而日本，西而德國（希特勒的德國），甚至於英，法，美，在原則上也都不反對，暫且把他們自己的衝突緩和一下，而希特勒以此爲要求軍備平等及恢復戰前殖民地的交換條件；日本以此爲吞併我東北，並借此又攫得西比利亞與東海濱省一帶，收入自己的版圖；誠爲得計。（三）然而他們不是傻子，現在的蘇聯至少不是一九一八至一九二二年的蘇聯。各國在那時進政都沒有得到好處，現在要進攻，至少要準備數倍於前的力量與數倍於前的犧牲，或許希特勒的德國與荒木派的日本將來會打先鋒，然而結果如何，沒有把握。德國的革命黨雖被褐衫黨的暴力一時壓迫，由街頭而鑽入地下室，然而若果同蘇聯打起仗來，他們便會又從地下室鑽出來，跑到街頭，拿起武器，擾亂希特勒的陣營。日本對於中國的征服才算完工，然而怎樣鎭撫反對，怎樣開發工業，怎樣積極準備，怎樣應付太平洋的風雲，他也不敢貿然從事。（四）日本之佔領東三省與熱河，自然是事先得了英法意等列强的默契的；法利用之以制蘇俄·英利用之以制他的勁敵美國，意大利對於東方關係甚淺，又無對外置喙的實力，亦只好聽之而已。這裏最受威脅的就是美國與蘇俄：蘇聯方閉門做他的第二個五年計畫，盡力容忍，美國雖然曉得，他若果要想維持他的資本之將來的尾閭，只有實力干涉日本的獨佔中國，但是他的兵力若不與蘇聯或英國合作，對於日本絶無奈他何。而且他的本身的危機，千瘡百孔，「戰爭常是革命的酵母」，這一層他是知道的，英日等國也是知道的。所以他們在這個嚴重時期，總極力設法避免武力衝突。（五）但是他們雖然在奔走呼號，極力在避免衝突，一方面也就是證明他們的衝突的爆發性在極度地增加，戰爭的毒鬚已經觸到了他們的意識。所以他們的備戰也就愈加積極，愈加吃勁。那末，大家都到了劍拔弩張的時候，火藥都安好了，只要有誰扯下火繩，如像斐笛南大公之一擊，馬上便發作了。（六）我們估計國際形勢，尤不可忘了殖民地的民族運動，譬如中日問題罷。日本帝國主義者之侵略東北四省的第一步的計畫實現以後，當然要少停一步以整理旣得之土地，在中國却只是空言「敵如進攻，誓必抵抗」，言外之意，不是恰合日本帝國主義者的胃口麽？然而前淸政府之所以滅亡，主因就是外交失敗，割地求和，今之視昔，如出一轍，中國的民族運動絶不會像他們一相情願地所幻想的就這樣平息下去的，中國的民族運動一定會繼續發展，增加世界大戰的爆發性與速度的。所以在資本帝國主義者的階級立塲及根本利害說來，進攻蘇聯自然比他們自相火併有利；然而自己的利害衝突是否能完全一致這是一個問題。法國及他所領導的小協約國對於所謂四强合作的態度，便可見一斑；即美國對於進攻蘇聯，就他目前的本身利益計，所得甚少，自然也不甚熱心。對於這個問題無論就那一方面說，若遽然下一肯定的答覆，我覺得有點危險，至少是我個人，沒有這個勇氣。至於乃君以爲「法人感於患生肘腋之間，不得不……遂相率與蘇聯訂立不侵犯條約。所謂反蘇聯戰線，於此而烟消雲散矣。」的論斷，恐怕也是太樂觀。我們固然不應當忘却「帝國主義間之衝突」即國際資本主義之内在的矛盾，然而同時我們也不可忘却國際間兩大營壘之尖銳的衝突。至於最近的將來的國際衝突究爲進攻蘇聯抑或帝國主義者間的衝突還要看前述各項的情勢之發展如何而定。這是記者個人的意見，還請大家討論。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>夏的開篇</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>春光去了，國難沒有去，還跟着司夏之神一步一步的進展！提到夏字，又有許多感想：中國稱華夏，華夏大搠其霉頭，成了（蠻夷猾夏）的世界。夏是三代之中第一代的國號，想到夏禹王八年足跡奠定山川，這是何等的功績？萬不料茫茫禹跡，變成了破碎河山！還有熱河，灤陽，北戴河等處，都是消夏避暑的好地方，現在不堪設想了！夏啊，夏啊，你來做什麽呢？百感交集的當兒，我來唱一首夏的開篇：</p>
<p>九十韶光去不回，送春迎夏也應該；區區是，驚心觸目逢炎夏，且把那，夏字從頭說一番：古稱華夏惟中國，爲什麽，夷運亨通夏運衰？只落得，蠻夷猾夏進榆關！曾記得，三代商周先有夏，夏禹王跋涉定河山：到今朝，河山破碎誰收拾？莽乾坤又見敵兵來，好向，夏王陵上哭哀哀！還記得，大院高堂稱夏屋，無奈是漂摇風雨已傾頺；燕雀處堂還不悟，依然是，往來舞榭與歌臺，早難道，後庭花忘却念家山？到如今，怕讀灤陽消夏錄，灤陽消夏總艱難；北戴河，受飛災，消夏之區弔刼灰！想區區，傷春才罷重嗟夏，舊恨新愁撥不開，只好把，人事蒼茫付酒杯！</p>
<h3>人類本性的表現</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>在大飯店跳舞場賭博的所在·和一切交際的塲合·不拘是男·女·老，少，沒一個不是一臉黄金色彩，把雪白大洋錢，當做蘿蔔片兒用。在那些地方，人類愛錢的本性，是汨沒掉了。有人說，這些事情，都在夜間活動的。夜，是人類安息的時間。在安息時間裏活動，巳根本有些反常。反常的生活，當然是汨沒本性的了。若是要看人類本性的表現，最好是在淸晨。當墊高了枕頭，睡足之後，頭腦再淸楚不過，那時，纔是顯露廬山眞面的唯一時間。</p>
<p>這些未經分析，不知是否合於哲理的迂腐之談，最近竟給與我一個很好的印象。事實是這樣的。有一個淸早、我跟妻小上小菜塲。在靑菜攤邊，幣見一位在跑狗塲時常遇見而不知姓名的某夫人。這位某夫人，買起票來眞狠，一出手總得二三十塊錢，輸了不當一回事。但我看伊買靑菜時，爲了一個子鐡靑着臉，幾乎合賣菜的打起架來。結果是某夫人佔了一個子的便宜，而臨走時，還狠狠的撈了一把不花錢的菜。這眞是再眞切沒有的人類体性的表現。</p>
<p>假使讀者有興到小菜塲觀光一下，定可得到很好的敎訓。在小菜塲裏，額上靑筋脹得大拇指般粗的種種爭執，就不過爲了一個子兒的出入。這種人類本性的表現，看着似乎有些不很大方，其實却是很有道理的。把主權土地送給人的大人物，就好像專在夜裏活動的闊老，一切都看得稀鬆平淡。用大力殺敵的英雄，正像小菜塲裏的賣者買者，處處表示出不肯吃虧的嘴臉。</p>
<h3>戒指的妙用</h3>
<p>— 黎民</p>
<p>我們貴中國人。自來對於戒指是當作無謂的裝飾品，沒有甚麽暗示的。後來經過了一般反對舊禮敎的新婚夫婦，利用了戒指作爲訂婚的交換品以後，戒指這件東西，就成爲一種有用意的東西了。爲了英國亨利公主出閣時，把结婚的戒指，帶在左手的無名指上，便釀成了一種特殊的風俗，造成世界上的習慣，以後就發現以下的幾個標準；</p>
<p>中指是表示訂婚的意義。</p>
<p>食指是表示求婚的意義。</p>
<p>小指是表示獨身主義。</p>
<p>美國的女子，爲避免求婚擁擠計，很有許多人，把一隻結婚的戒指帶在無名指上，來拒絶男性們的白纏繞，所以美國的結婚戒指，每年銷去統計，竟達千萬之多。</p>
<p>我們中國的一般妓女，因爲在月經期内要防止嫖客的留宿，所以伊們也用戒指來做表示，這與結婚也是有同樣的意義的。</p>
<p>但是還有很多出風頭的人們，伊們不知道戒指的意義，往往用來作爲裝飾品，這眞是太過分的辜負自己了！</p>
<h3>傷春</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>人們雖喊着；「春到了！」誰知那「春之神」好像羞見人面，依舊沒有光臨。你想入春以來，春寒料峭，春雨連綿，人人都呌着冷。那日暖風和，春光明媚的日子，簡直很少很少。我人雖欲刻意尋春，終有「春光不知何處去」之感。現在是「流水落花春去也。」眼眨眨九十日大好春光，又要向人們告辭了。但是春去尙有重來之日；那已失的錦繡山河，不知何日可以重返呢？對此斜風細雨，北望雲烟，眞不禁「黯然魂銷」咧！</p>
<h3>中國公園</h3>
<p>— 趙子明</p>
<p>外灘公園，雖有樹林，花草，假山石……但地臨江岸，烟霧障氣，毫無幽雅之點。不及兆豐公園之叢林靑葱，池水澄淸無處不合天然風味。如果跨進蘇州河畔的中國公園。始知又不及外灘公園，比之兆豐公園，不啻小巫見大巫丨</p>
<p>中國公園，的確是平民化，不取門票，任人游覽。門口有一座厠所，臭氣四溢。墻上貼滿「包治白濁」「圆光靈騐」「通經草」「醫梅毒」……的廣告。五光十色，美不勝收，可算粘得其所，厠所兩旁有小食攤；賣香烟，花生米，大餅，油條……，黄包車夫圍着大啖。其味津津然。</p>
<p>際此春日，園内草地，仍是不發靑，樹上的葉，還是枯凋，簡直如深秋平原一般，空塲中擺滿許多鳥籠，優逸的蘇州人，含着烟嘴，興高采烈的在鬭鳥。百靈鳥是他們第二生命。現在國勢已成如何田地？亡國、奴如何痛苦？……他們是永遠不會想到的。眞所謂「袁莫大於心死」。嗚呼　夫復何言？</p>
<p>園西有草亭。小　三，仰臥在凳上，信口唱；「一馬離了西凉界……」污臉的小孩。踏在凳上跳着，笑着，哭着……滿地濃痰，花生殼，香烟頭狠藉不堪，中國人道德心何在？難怪先前外國公園要限制華人入内了。</p>
<p>中國公園，那配稱「公園」，不過是流氓，　三的合所集罷了！</p>
<p>靑社彩排誌盛靑社曲集，一昨彩串於湖社，佳劇如林，美不勝收。最精彩者，當以跪池爲冠，自始至終，三人合作到底，配合之緊凑，神態之逼眞，令人拍案呌絶，曲友中罕見之作也。次推别母回營，一則精力彌滿，悲壯淋漓，一則描摹老鍊，德神絶倒，堪稱二難。喬醋醉圓爲名家之作，的是不凡，幾聲縱笑，尤爲獨得。夜課痴夢，悲喜並陳，恰到好處，琴挑偷詩，細膩熨貼，宛轉動人，小宴斷橋，搭配純熟，璧合珠聯。訪普刀會，實大聲宏，難能可貴。思凡佳期之輕盈流利，議劍寄子之慷慨當歌，各盡其長。照鏡養馬之梯突滑稽，爲之絶倒，佳搆如此，無怪顧曲者晝夜不倦，興會倍濃也。（王祺）</p>
<p>社會寫真</p>
<h3>喜劇</h3>
<p>— 林梓春</p>
<p>爲了要到Ｈ市去看一個友人接洽些事，只得又要搭乘一次長江船了。</p>
<p>在我對面的房間裏，住着一位摩登健美的少婦，或許是乘客稀少的原故？伊我一樣獨自一人佔了一間房間。她的房門是常常開着的，在外面走過的人，看得很淸楚，伊老是睡在牀上看書。除了爲解决「便」的問題以外，難得出房門一步，吃飯也在房間裏。</p>
<p>一個西裝靑年，不知是否旅客？他在伊的房門口徘徊得最起勁，連帶着的在他唇上不時發出麥唐納和死勿來在「璇宫艶史」影片裏所唱的那支歌曲，他走路和吹唇的姿勢很不錯，使别的乘客們見了都在摇頭讚賞？</p>
<p>是第二天了，吃過晚飯我覺得很無聊，就到這船的賬房裏和職員們閒談，我和他們素識，談話並不拘束。我們談得不久，那摩登少婦忽然走到這賬房裏來，</p>
<p>「你們是賬房先生嗎？」伊很客氣的問。</p>
<p>「是的。請問女士有什麽事嗎？」職員們說。「眞眞豈有此理？有一個穿西裝的靑年客人，他時時在我的房門口走來走去，還朝我擠眉弄眼！我並不睬他。本來我因房間裏空氣不大好，所以把房門開着。爲了討厭這客人，不得已把房門關了。不料他又到窗口張望。今晚他竟寫了這張字條給我，你們看吧。」說着，伊就將一張用鉛筆寫的信箋遞給一個Ｘ姓職員。</p>
<p>「……你是天上的安琪兒再世，使我萬分的欽慕，怎奈你總不理睬我！……我覺得世間已無留戀！决於今晚Ｘ時投江自殺，…所遺下在Ｘ號房間裏的我的行李等物，千托代爲帶交舍下感激無旣……」</p>
<p>ＸＸ敬上卽日</p>
<p>信箋上的字跡不大好，還有幾個别字！上面是我照他的語意改成的。</p>
<p>「啊…笑話笑話！自殺要先發請柬嗎？他好像在說，（謹訂Ｘ月Ｘ日Ｘ時爲ＸＸ自殺之期恭請觀光）眞是笑話奇談，女士請你安心去睡吧。不要害怕，一切有我們。一職員們看過那信箋在安慰伊說。</p>
<p>「喂…時間到了，你們去問他吧。」Ｘ姓職員在對茶役們說。登時幾個茶役走上前去將那靑年拖住，跟着我和職員們也走上前去。</p>
<p>「先生…你是Ｘ號的客人嗎？……年紀靑靑前途無量……爲什麽要自殺呢？……現在國難如此嚴重！如果爲國犧牲不比這無謂的自殺光榮嗎？」職員們嘈雜着向那靑年說。</p>
<p>「我並不自殺，你們拖住我做什麽？……」靑年像知道西洋鏡拆穿了，說話有些不自然。「你不是和那Ｘ號的女客說要投江自殺嗎？還有…這裏是你給那女客的字條。」職員們駁那靑年說。</p>
<p>嘈雜的吵閙聲，將許多乘客們驚動了奔出來看，少婦也在内，並且指着那靑年說「是他」這人怕有神經病吧？」一個三十多歲的中年客人說。</p>
<p>「不…怕是落水鬼附在他身上？快些重重的打他幾下耳光，就可以將落水鬼嚇跑了。一另一個乘客中的老婦人說。</p>
<p>珮　年想掙脫茶役們的老來解說他並不自殺…一個茶役早在他的面頰上打了幾記耳光，才放他從人叢中帶着「赤化」的面孔溜走了。</p>
<p>這樣的一幕喜劇，就在大家「哈哈哈……」的聲中閉了幕，大家好像看了這喜劇很滿意？</p>
<p>長篇小說</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第五回煮茗度長宵愴懷歲暮題標抗暴日呐喊聲高</p>
<p>這三個學生，約莫有二十來歲，都是喝醉了酒似的，一張通紅的面孔。那風沙迎面吹來，又在紅上加了一道深灰。隨着這個大標語之下，便是一羣過千數的男女學生，在一枝小白紙旗之下，都帶着一張緊張而又悲慘的面孔，前面那個拿傳話筒的學生，將筒口緊對了扶桑三鳧的東方喊道：驅逐不抵抗將軍丨打倒日本帝國主義丨於是後面整千的人，都迎風張了大嘴，跟着這口號喊將起來。尤其是其中的女學生放着尖銳的聲浪，將最後一個字拉得極長，令人聽了，說不出一種什麽感想。殷得仁道：他媽的，又是這一套不抵抗？他們怎不去抵抗呢？趙自强是個持重的人，連忙將他一帶讓他偏過臉去。田靑也悄悄的道：幸是他們正亂着，沒有聽到，要不然，可是一塲禍事。殷得仁道：那怕什麽丨他們旣是愛國的分子，就知道講理，我要把這套理和他們講一講。三個人正如此糾纏着，却廳到有一種悄悄的聲音在後面呌道：你們三位在這裏說些什麽？趙自强一回頭，却是一個女學生，只見他穿件藍布襖子，伸出兩隻手臂來，凍得像紫蘿萄似的。下面的黑綢裙子，穿得短短的，露出大腿上一大截墨綠色的毛襪子來。下面一隻黑番布球鞋旣短且圓。頭上的短頭髮，被風吹着，撒了個一團茅草。只是伊那張俊秀的鵝蛋臉子，雖然蒙了些風沙，可是遮不住那水一般的秀色，便笑道：啊喲！黄曼黄小姐來了，省了我們把弟不少的事。田靑田頭一看，正是他的愛人，便笑道：喲！這樣大冷的天，穿這一點衣服，你也不怕冷。說話時，見伊肩上拖下一截圍巾來，於是扶起來替伊圍在悖子上。殷得仁道：二哥，你瞧小田，這一股子勁。趙自强用手碰了他一下手臂，又瞅了他一眼道：你眞是個猛張飛，怎麽說出這種話來？黄曼黄也向殷得仁瞅了一眼，笑道：殷連長說話，好大的嗓子。（五九）</p>

<h3>「自許南陽葛人懷秦會之」</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>北平近有人作諧詩：「自許南陽萬，人懷秦會之。」一語道破今日一些人的心中秘密！</p>
<p>「諸葛大名埀宇宙」，這豈不是天下第一等美事？無奈「大名」非同垃圾，可以隨處掇拾。諸葛亮從臥龍崗下山，正當劉備定痗運；以劉備與曹操的往日交情，諸葛亮大可送一送順水人情，勸劉備歸降曹操，圖一個終身富貴。而諸葛計不出此，必親自奉命求救於孫將軍，與曹操决一死戰。劉備虢亭敗績，白帝城「中道崩殂」；若依「必先安内而後可以攘外」的原則，諸葛亮先該和孫吳併個你死我活，然後六出祁山。而諸葛受託孤之重寄，却先修好孫吳，認定「漢賊不兩立」，非「六出祁山」不可。以諸葛亮的聲望和地位，若和司馬懿秘密修好，何患不「富貴逼人來」？而他「鞠躬盡瘁」直到五丈原斷氣，還是「漢賊不兩立」，呌姜維斷承他的遺志。這種埀宇宙的大名，得來未免過於辛苦。現在有此諸葛亮否。</p>
<p>岳飛墓前，掛着一副某女士的對聯，下聯是「白鐡無辜鑄佞臣」，這種身後問題，秦會之大概不理不問。當時，會之欲得相位，揚言道：「我有二策，可聳動天下。」他做了宰相，果然獻出兩策：「以河北人還金，中原人還劉豫。」他决定了和議大計，對高宗說：「臣僚畏首尾，多持兩端，此不足以論大事。」若陛下决欲講和，乞專與臣議，勿許羣臣預。」羣臣反對和議，檜便大怒曰：「如檜但欲濟國事耳！」這樣直接爽快，要和便和，隨你怎樣笑駡，他都不理。他殺了岳飛，身後跪在岳飛墓前，任千人萬人溺辱，他也是十分情願。現在不知也有人學秦檜否。</p>
<p>詩云：「收拾乾坤一担担，上肩容易下肩難：勸君高着擎天手，多少旁人冷眼看！」我想把這首詩再賦一回呢！</p>
<h3>探病</h3>
<p>— 裘鵬</p>
<p>推開門，看門人的陰沉的臉從門杠邊浮出來。</p>
<p>「？」</p>
<p>「四百二十號病房？」</p>
<p>「樓上」看門人揚起一隻手隨便的向左邊一揮，不屑理的神情中還顯現着幾分倦態。</p>
<p>我依着他揮給我的方向走，脚是那麽的沉重，一步拖一步的！拐過灣，就見白色水門汀的盤梯蛇似的蜿蜒在　前。兩旁是白的墻，白的窗帘；一個白衣的看護婦，緩緩地推着一具兩輪小車，車裏裝着一個裏着白色被單的病人，一　死白的臉……我循着盤梯上去，無數白色的圈子在我眼前晃過，一種奇異的了冥府似的感覺侵襲我的心，我　幽靈一樣飄動著！</p>
<p>「ＮＯ４２Ｏ」突然這數字淸晣的　在我眼前，於是我輕輕的敲着那釘了這數字的門。一個紅腫了兩眼的中年婦人給我開了門，讓我走進去重又輕輕地關上　拖在那婦人背後的是一個約莫五六歲的瘦小的孩子，這時正睜大着眼珠向我瞧。在那臨窗的一張病床上，ＸＸ君　一具屍骸似的靜躺着，深陷的兩眼微閉着，幾根稀稀的蒼白的頭髮衰草似的蓬亂地披埀在乾　的頭顱上……當我走近他的床邊，他睜開了那失神的眼珠瞧了　好一會，纔伸出一隻枯柴似的手來，招我坐在床沿上。</p>
<p>「好些嗎？」我開始笨拙的慰間：</p>
<p>「還不是時日遲早的問題，生的希望是不會有的了。」</p>
<p>「什麽病呢？」我驚疑語氣的過激。</p>
<p>「肺癆！醫生　這病完全是因長期的操勞過度，沒有相當的休息，尤其是不應該在拖延到已經給黴菌腐蝕了半片肺葉的現在纔來醫！一切都太遲…這，我何嘗不知道呢？可是ＸＸ，你說，處在像我這樣的環境裏·容許我有一個休息的機會嗎？每次當我忍着心口的隱痛工作着的時候，我就會想到這不是在加速的摧毁着我這殘餘的生命嗎？那麽，放下手來吧！我却又不能不顧慮到妻兒們的衣食！這樣掙扎到今天，誰知終於是………」</p>
<p>他哽咽着轉過臉去，兩顆涙珠從那深陷的眼眶裏迸流出來。</p>
<p>沉重的悲哀壓住我的心丨我悄然無語的　坐着。</p>
<p>「其實」，「死」在我看來，像睡覺一樣的平凡。像我這樣的生命有什麽値得留戀呢？苦的是他們娘兒兩口，以後將怎樣……」。</p>
<p>他噙住眼涙抬起那對暗淡的眼珠瞧瞧他的妻，妻正把臉埋在手帕裏抽泣着；孩子瞧瞧爸，又瞧瞧媽，忽然也拉住媽的衣角痛哭起來。</p>
<p>他閉上眼，重又把臉掉過去！</p>
<p>「又是一個長期出賣勞力者的結果啊　」我也突然的把眼睛閉上了。</p>
<h3>美國的家庭生活</h3>
<p>— 錢歌川</p>
<p>物質文明發達到某程度的時候，社會的機構也就要發生變化了。家庭是不是可以永遠存續下去，都會成爲問題的。如美國現代的家庭生活就昭示了我們一個這樣的意義美國因爲機械的發達，個人的時間便有了餘裕，又因　　備的周全，家庭的勞動，幾乎巳不必需，再加以貞操的破産，男女關係更無保障之可言。所以雖有家庭的形式，而無家庭的實際，這種朝不保夕的家庭，眞是値得社會學者去　究一下的。　　人類生活的形式，原是决定社會組織的要素，而近代的機械生活，却給人類生活之基本的家庭，掀起了一大革命。現代的美國人，受着機械文明的恩惠，家庭内的工作，比起從前來，幾乎只留　十分之　了　家庭中所需要的一切，都用不着人工去取，水可以由自來水管運來，火可以由瓦斯式電氣供給，開水從早早晚都在地下室裏沸騰着。當主婦的人，只消用她那纎纎玉手，把龍頭一扭，於是水也有了，火也有了。在家裏坐着不動，不僅要開水有開水　就是熱天裏要冰，也就很容易。因爲有一種電氣製冰器，只要把冷水放進去，便可以變成冰出來。旣有瓦斯，又有電氣，開水冷冰，一應俱全，照這樣看來，弄飯做菜也就極不費力了。然而美國那些家庭生活者，這一點點麻煩，都不願幹，肚皮餓了的時候，就輕輕拿起聽筒打個電話，於是華筵盛饌，都不到一刻鐘，便陳列在他們的前面了。唯一案樂的地方，在現代的美國，巳經不是家庭。他們　在家裏的時候，實在太少，每天除了早餐以外，普通的家庭，都是在外面吃飯的。</p>
<p>美國現代的建築，門窗都能吻合，毫無縫隙，外面的灰塵是不容易進去的。而且他們有一種眞空掃除　，用來在室中推動一回，什麽灰屑都吸進去了。　舖是裝在壁櫃裏的，夜裏把它轉到房子中間來，早晨又可收了進去。</p>
<p>最能維繫家庭的，莫過於兒女，但美國現代的女人，多巳不願生男育女，縱然有了，嬰孩可以送入醫院，稍長仍能托之於看護婦，或專請保姆招呼。沒有錢的母親，日中要出來作工，兒女也都是寄到托兒所代養的，（兒女到成人以後，便與父母視若路人了。）</p>
<p>在家庭内當主婦的尙且如此，男人更不待言了。家庭與他們發生關係的地方，僅是夜裏睡覺，早上收信。所以他們用不着獨立的家庭，許多人都把公寓或旅館作長遠的住家。因爲那裏連家庭中的設備，和扭龍頭的麻煩，都用不着了家庭之　旣道　不必要人招呼，當然男　女女都有餘裕可以向外發　。美國現在的女人，可以入總統府做閣員，可以到外國去當公使，像中國女人一般，只講它坐在家裏當太太的，當然很少。男女各人日中都要到外面去作事，不能鎭日相守，所謂家庭團　之樂，自然要特别減少下來，女子經濟上旣不依頼男子，她也就大可以自由，從前那種只强迫女人一方面遵守的貞操，他們現在却不高興再遵守了。離婚又算得什麽呢？一個女子並不因爲一度離婚便不能再嫁人的。而且離婚之後，男子照例要出担養費，總是女子得便宜，所以美國的離婚，多是從女子發動的。現在美國在五個結婚之中中，似乎便有一個離婚的。今日便然翻閱美國的文藝新聞ＴＨＥ（未完）</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＩＵＬＥＳＲＥＮＡＲＤ作林取譯</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚在路上發見了一隻像掃烟囱的人一般黑的鼹鼠。當他玩夠了之後，他便决計把牠弄死。他幾次把牠抛在天空，狠靈巧地抛着，使彵恰恰落在一塊石頭上。</p>
<p>起初，經過的情形狠好，並且做得狠敏捷。</p>
<p>鼠的脚已跌斷了，腦壳已經碰開了，背也弄碎了，牠的生命似乎並不怎樣堅牢。但，隨後，紅蘿蔔鬚看見牠並沒有完全死去，這可嚇呆了。他雖把牠抛得狠高，抛過屋頂，抛到天空，但他沒有法子把牠弄死。</p>
<p>「這混賬東西！牠還沒有死，」他　　着。</p>
<p>眞的，在那染着　的石頭上，鼹弄得稀爛一團；牠那滿是脂肪的肚子像凝汁一般顫動着，因爲有着這種顫動，所以牠還像是活着一樣。</p>
<p>「混賬極了！」紅蘿蔔鬚變得狂熱起來，他呌喊：「牠還沒有死！」</p>
<p>他把牠檢起來，辱駡着，改換一個方法。</p>
<p>氣得滿臉通紅，眼涙汪汪地，他把牠唾辱着，隔得狠近，盡力對石頭上抛去。可是那難看的肚子照舊顫動着。</p>
<p>並且，紅蘿蔔鬚瘋了般的把牠打擊得更利害，鼹鼠便更像沒有死的的樣子。</p>
<p>蓿</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚和大哥斐利克斯做完了　禱便連忙跑回家來，因爲這是下午四點鐘吃點心的時候了。</p>
<p>大哥斐利克斯可以得到一片揩着牛油或是菓醬的麵包，紅蘿蔔鬚則祗能得到一片乾麵包。　　這是因爲他要老早就做大人，曾經當着許多人宣稱自己不貪吃的緣故。他歡喜簡單的東西，平素總是像煞有介事地吃着乾麵包。這天下午他比大哥斐利克斯走得更快，想最先拿到麵包。</p>
<p>有時乾麵包好像狠難下咽的樣子。於是紅蘿蔔鬚像攻擊一個敵人似的，使出渾身氣力，把它抓住，用牙齒拚命咬着，把它分做幾塊，弄得碎屑紛飛。他家裏的人圍在旁邊，狠好奇地瞧着他。</p>
<p>他那駝鳥一般的胄，連石頭或是起着銅綠的古錢都可以消化。</p>
<p>總而言之，他吃東西是現得最隨便不過的。</p>
<p>他按着門上的挿鎖。門已經鎖了。</p>
<p>「我想爹媽都不在家。你用脚踢踢看。」他說。</p>
<p>大哥斐利克斯一而咒駡着，一面猛力的把那笨重的釘着許多釘子的大門撞得許久許久還在　着。隨後兩個人又一齊用力撞着，把肩膀都撞傷了，門還是沒有撞開。</p>
<p>「他們一定都不在家」。紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>「那麽他們到那裏去了呢？」大哥斐利克斯憤怒地問。</p>
<p>「誰也不能什麽都知道的。我們權且坐一坐罷。」</p>
<p>他們坐在冰冷的階級上，感到種稀有的飢餓。時而打着呵欠，時而用拳頭敲着胸脯，表示他們的滿懷怒意。</p>
<p>斐利克斯丨丨如果他們以爲我會等待他們，那他們就打錯了主意！</p>
<p>紅蘿丨丨可是我們不等又有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>斐利克斯丨丨我眞不會等待他們呢。我不願挨餓，我。我要立刻就吃，不論什麽東西。吃草也好。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨吃草！這主意倒不錯，都麽他們可要上當了。</p>
<p>斐利克斯丨丨嘿！人家吃生菜「ＳＡＬＡＤＥ」不也吃得狠好。打個譬如，假若我們吃　蓿，這不也和生菜一樣有味。這就是不用油和醋的生菜。（未完）</p>

<p>小麥一二兩日之期麥市况、大致亦在平穩之中、一日市面、洋麥報價、雖見狂漲、惟目下廠方、因現洋麥存底尙厚、對子標準、無意收買、市面亦未過分帶高、迨至昨日、洋麥雖已報小一二角、惟抛戶亦不盛、雙方同在觀望、因之交易甚少、市價則略帶緊、觀此種情形、恐須出新後、方能轉入熱閙也、結果七月份較前月收價漲六分、八九月份漲四分云、</p>

<h3>張學良拜甘地</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>乖乖丨輪船火車眞是跑得太快、我們耳邊還很新鮮的聽着張同志的「下野」「出洋」的嗡嗡之聲，現在却一會兒便到了印度的孟買，據說唐僧到西天取經，雖然跨的是神龍化身的白馬，却也走了好些年頭，還不一定就到過孟買，所以科學的發明，對於我們的張同志之類的「下野」「出洋」，或是出國修養，那眞是太方便了，這一點，是我們老百姓連想不敢想的，</p>
<p>張學良同志這次出洋是很振刷了一下的，甚至於還决心戒除嗜好。有人說這是因爲歐美各國並不曾也實行「鴉片公賣」不免要非常不便，其實他是要誠心做一個模範的中國人給中國爭體面，正因爲如此，當然對不抵抗主義，也得宣揚光大，以「正國際視聽」，所以在孟買便打定主意，要去訪問他的老師傳甘地了，可是不幸，不得政府許可，只好作罷。</p>
<p>不過我們可以完全相信，張同志對於這一偉大的主義，一定要「繼續努力以求貫澈」的，老師傳甘地聖人，當然也是如此，雖然他們是一個在野，一個以牢，一個是亡國的國民一個是將亡而未亡的良將，然而他們的事業都很成功。事實擺在眼前，幾年來印度就有不少的勞苦大衆爲了這偉大的主義而光榮的犧牲而中國更是成績昭著令外人驚嘆不已。假如這次英政府果然「許可」，他和甘地相見，隔着鐡栅伸過手去，那末，一個呼聲仁兄，一個呌一聲賢弟，大家皆莞爾微笑，一切都心照不宣。最可惜的便是英政府一定不給他拜訪。否則大家師徒見見面，從此更加努力，於是主義風行，全世界弱小民族，都在不抵抗的命令之下，讓帝國主義征服得心平氣靜。而這二位師徒們也就因此高官爵祿。樂享太平。</p>
<p>還有一點，我們的張同志此刻是閒情逸緻，也是最爲明顯的，理由是孟買隔南京是那樣路遠迢迢，而南京到長城口外也是遠得可以，當然聽不見帝國主義的砲聲。即使馬上打到平津，對於我們的同志們也不見得如何不利。所以，我們很可以臆斷得到：將來不抵抗主義一定是代有人傳，不過甘地之不抵抗，與張學良之不抵抗主義，究有些分别的。</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>花市</p>
<p>上海丨黑暗的地獄，抬起頭來，瞧不見天是什麽樣兒；偶然從小樓的窗口望去，也僅僅是灰白色的一角，被高大的建築物衝破了；更瞧不見花，瞧不見樹。「犬與華人，不准入内，」的狗頭牌，早已除，去我是知道的，從鐡樣杆的外面也望見過外國小孩子抛球的所在，但是在咱們的國土上。還站着個黑牙的異國人。一個孫頭的代價，在跳舞塲上是五分鐘可以化去的；但是在窮人的袋裏，或整個月後還捨不得滚進米店的錢櫃；我終於是望望鐡樣杆内外國小孩子抛球的所在，緊抓着那雪白孫頭歸來。　　爲了自己的職務關係，時常踏進富麗堂皇的客室，那案頭上小巧的膽瓶中，四季的鮮花是調換着，這使我懷疑上海的鮮花是神秘的怪物。但是自己旣化不起每月幾元的代價去獲得它們，也不好意思問人家我愛的鮮花的來處。這疑問在一夜天沒有睡的高價中破案。</p>
<p>報館中出來，一行人向小王家的路上蕩去，在踏出南陽的鐡門，沁人心脾的香氣微風中迎送來我的鼻管分外尖銳，這是鮮花的芬芳。萬花樓丨小茶館丨門前儘是各式各樣的花映進我的眼簾時，我像小孩一般的狂躍起來。萬花樓内更有高價的花卉展覽着我沒有徴求同伴的意見。經自從人叢中踏上萬花樓，茶博士攔住我去路說：一先生，對不起，花市不賣客茶的。」我站着沒有話說，不知怎樣回答他好，小五等已擠上來笑了說：「借一個凳子我們門外坐坐可以嗎？我們是很喜歡花的。」花博士很　通的　一個凳子給我們，花市　南陽橋起直達辣斐德路口。褲脚捋將大腿的中年男子，曲了背的老婦人，南京路上喊着「阿要白蘭花？」輕年女子，都在他們的收獲上討論價格，預備天明之後賣給都市的人們供案頭的裝飾。</p>
<p>我望着這許多含苞未吐的鮮花可憐，你們從很遠的鄕下送到上海來，僅僅是案頭上一天的供奉，第二次天明的時候，你早已棄進垃圾桶，你的壽命竟是這樣的短促！</p>
<p>我更遐想故鄕的院子，中有我手植的數十盆石臘紅，自我剽泊到上海以來，你們的命運不知和我同樣的遭遇嗎？　　歸來小樓，案頭一枝紙製的小花對我頻頻點首。它自我搬進小樓，始終保持因有的鮮艶，我因爲沒有鮮花也特别保護它，至今還妖媚的向人微笑哩！花，這是你們的命運　你們以聖潔的心待人，不免被抓進垃圾桶；塗上了紅的綠的，反能在這世界中生存！</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>一·楔子</p>
<p>自己旣是一個以做文章爲職業的人，所以多半的光陰都消磨在筆尖墨點之間。但是却不免被人駡爲「文丐」幾乎近於無恥。本來，像這樣的嘲笑，的確很是難堪，有幾回簡直氣得耳紅面赤，忿忿然怒形於色，甚至於想使盡氣力噴他一口唾沬，再和他角力一次，然而平心靜氣的一想，自己事實上旣經如此。並不能馬上放下筆桿而立刻成爲正人君子，何况又從不曾掛起ＡＲＴＦＯＲＡＲＴ的招牌，所以不久，也就處之泰然了。現在寫作了以後也許還要寫作。</p>
<p>可是做文章也並不怎樣容易，至少在結構方面就很難找着自己認爲滿意的題材，這一點，我想凡是能夠寫作的人，大概都有同感。那末現在我就不得不感謝我的一位鄰居了。</p>
<p>這人姓武，單名貴。本來就是一個很了不起的名字，即就其貴字而言，其本人，很應當發達一下，不過有時候連名帶姓很快的喊呌起來，却不免不大雅聞。然而他老是被人們這樣有意或無意的呼喚着，雖然有些小孩兒們少不了嘩然大笑，可是他却滿不在乎。於此可知，他的氣量的確是大得可以。</p>
<p>那末我之認識他，固然上面已提到他是我的鄰居，很可以常常見面，不過他又有着這樣有趣的名字，於是無形中更令我注意其人了。</p>
<p>那是一個熱天的黄昏，因爲天氣太熱的原故，小哈巴狗兒還在伸着舌頭喘氣。這時　太太和師母　多半在凉台上打牌或是聽無線電播音；　有娘姨和阿媽之類却在衖堂内的汽車旁邊摇着蒲扇。其時武貴也坐在一張小　子上夾在女人中間談談笑笑，看上去似乎很是淸閒。</p>
<p>堂我趿着拖鞋走到他面前的時候，他連忙十分禮貌的起來讓坐。他老是那末客氣，老是滿口的大爺大爺。雖然我總覺得自己並沒有那種身份，但是他旣然非如此不可，隨後也就打定主意就讓他這樣稱呼罷，反正世界上就免不了要這樣大家客氣客氣。</p>

<p>「十元錢捐給人家·太不合算了這十元錢可以給愛人買一件美麗的衣服……」那迷人的兩個眼睛，一渦笑臉，閃耀在他的眼前。</p>
<p>他伸手到袋裏換了一張五元的鈔票。</p>
<p>「拿去他想說。但一轉念，五元錢又可以吃一次豐富的大菜………密司汪的手錶還沒有給給買呢？……」</p>
<p>於是，突然的：他的手又從外邊伸回袋中。</p>
<p>「呀！先生……」募捐的不耐煩起來了。</p>
<p>這次，那紳士當眞摸出了一塊亮晶晶的袁頭，遞給了那募捐的人。</p>
<p>「好……現代東北的義勇軍謝謝先生！」募捐者拿了錢走了。</p>
<p>紳士呆呆的立在路上，胡亂的想道：</p>

<p>獸兵</p>
<p>編輯先生，</p>
<p>我是一個年幼無知的人，今年纔二十一歲：在十九歲那年，經父母的主持給我結了婚。我們雙方的感情非常好，今年四月初間，我纔到的上海，是經人介紹入某某醫院裏學醫。最近接到家中的來信；告訴我那邊遭兵災，我的妻被兵士强姦了。依着我父母的意思，是想呌她自由出去，因爲這於我們家中的體面有關。來信是問我的意思：但我想到她從前對於我的愛情是那樣的好，二年來示曾紅過一次臉。有心留下吧，父母又不許可；不留吧，於心實有不忍。這使我心中進退兩難，望</p>
<p>衔生有以敎我，是所至禱。祝您</p>
<p>刻安張志强鞠躬</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按；姦非罪的所以能成爲離婚的條件者，其理由有二。（一）因爲愛情是不能同時容納一個人以上的，他或她旣經另有所屬，當然要對於他的妻，或她的本夫，愛情淡薄起來。與其貌合神離，同床異夢，反不如乾脆地離了。（二）因爲人的本性，不免有一種獨占慾，尤其是對於愛的相手方，這種獨占思想格外强烈。所以姦夫毒殺本夫，以及姘婦謀害本妻的事實，層出不窮。爲確保安全計，只有離婚的一法。</p>
<p>現在張君的夫人，是被兵士强姦的；她對於張君的愛情，當然根本沒有絲毫摇動。而且你要是能夠原諒她，對於她這次的遭遇，用好言好語去温慰她，她對於你的愛情，祇有濃厚的分兒，絶對不會發生問題。</p>
<p>至於兵士的强姦婦女，純係一種洩慾的獸行，根本沒有愛的作用。他們今天在這裏强姦了甲女，明天又到旁的地方去强姦乙女。對於昨日的甲女，完全置之度外，從沒有再來繼續求歡，或甚至演出謀殺本夫的一類事情。所以張君夫婦的前途，根本不會因爲這次不幸的事情而發生任何危險。</p>
<p>根據上面的論斷，我們以爲張君毫沒有理由要同他夫人難異。在人情上，你應當憐惜她；在法律上，也不能讓你這樣的待你夫人。這件事的責任，完全在不法的兵士與他官長的身上。</p>
<p>你說留了她，父母不許可；這層我們看來未必。他們旣寫信來徴你的同意，當然你還有說話的餘地。至於面子有關，更不成問題；你要知道，你留了你的夫人，人家要恥笑你，你當然也是無法去禁止他。但你要明白，這是他們自己的無見識，與你毫不相干。</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「道德寳鑑」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>表面上揭穿「舊道德」的幻幕</p>
<p>實際上是爲「舊道德」說敎</p>
<p>明星公司自有了「狂流」和「女性的呐喊」問世以後。事實上是走上了新的道路。當然，這種轉變，在中國的電影界中，應該認爲一種好現象。但是這中間却亦有可以疑問的地方。即如「琵琶春怨」的近乎擁護封建勢力和現在這張「道德寳鑑」，亦未免爲舊道德說敎。同時，我們記得，聯華的「城市之夜」，曾經受着社會上一般公正的批評，但是現在「道德寳鑑」的結論，又提出了「到鄕村去」的口號，無疑義的，這始終不是我們觀衆所能接收的。</p>
<p>爲了我們必須以堅苦嚴正的精神，來促進中國電影走上正確的大道，我們必須對於本片的作者，貢獻一點必要的意見。</p>
<p>看過本片之後，我們觀衆應當認識；導演王獻齋和編劇李南沙二君，確以大無畏的精神，揭穿了僞道德的内幕：莊守道以「古道熱腸」而誘姦秀珠，在挪用公欵之餘，而又不惜謀財害命，其後棄前妻而另寵新歡，假軍威而奪子，買通律師而串同欺騙，敎兒子循規蹈矩，而自己却姦淫女僕；這些都是使觀衆了解僞善者究竟是在怎樣的欺騙和陷害人們。</p>
<p>但是在後面本片的作者却告訴了我們一些什麽呢？守道的兒子莊大少爺因羞憤而爲「道德」而殉道，秀珠母女因憤恨都市的罪惡，而到鄕村去。</p>
<p>固然，在半封建的中國現實社會中，爲了私有制度的不能廢除，誰都是懷着自私自利的心情而日夜鑽營，然而這决不是道德問題，而是實際的麫包問題。正因爲如此，有多少僞善者假借道德的美名，而成爲剥削欺騙的工具。在另一方面，當然也有被欺騙者，被剥削者，在痛苦的掙扎着生存，甚至於女人們也不免要出賣靈魂和肉體而與公子少爺相週旋。但是，我們對於這些，也可以「道德」二字來解釋嗎？當然這呈個嚴重的經濟問題。所以，我們必須指出道德問題在和有經濟的社會制度中的重要性，以及封建勢力的「道德」在資本主義的社會中，必然的消滅，於是我們决不能爲道德而護道，因爲已經失了它的存在性：所以不必以莊志卿來殉道，何况一個被現實社會所沉醉的大少爺，也不至於因一時的良心發現，而居然自殺。至於封建勢力的鄕村，也决不會比都市一純潔」多少，何况是大家都已知道「此路不通」。同時，在劇情的進展上，也似乎用不着這一幕，這未免有書蛇添足之嫌。總之，我覺得在我們的作品上，一個問題不能得着解决的時候，倒不如不解决還能夠發人深思。</p>
<p>至於在技巧上，我們多少可看得出初次導演的王獻齋確有攝影塲的經騐，而且也相當聰明，如莊志卿和舞女打電話，如父親偷　兒子的淫書等。然而秋艶母女和志卿的纏綿，不曾有系統的說明，是不是說她母女串通取財，或是說她和他已有了愛情而得母氏的同意呢？其他還有缺點，但一時記不起來了。</p>

<p>都市裏的觀衆看慣了以都市生活爲背影的影片，（「大飯店」之類的特殊片子當然例外），過着以山野成海洋爲背影的影片，或是西席地密爾導演的歷史片，換換口味，比較的容易表示歡迎，即在電影事業的立塲上，也是一個相當的出路。國泰昨天開映的「斬鯨結儷」，就以海船捕鯨爲號召，雖不能說是頂好的影片，演來也還頗見情彩；無論如何，比到以前兩次跡近敷衍塲面的影片，進步得多了。正片之前雖沒有新聞片，然而代以幾幕音樂片及滑稽畫片，比到前一次無聊的狗戲，也可以說是差强人意的地方。</p>
<p>「斬鯨結儷」劇怚簡單而膚淺，然而有些曲折的地方沒有預先看說明書的人恐怕不大容易明瞭。美國海岸有「穆皮狄克」巨鯨爲害商旅的經過，影片裏以紀念死者的碑文爲序幕，也還可以過得去。少年英雄埃哈與但烈爲兄弟的關係却不甚明白。七年之後埃哈積資自置一船，身爲船長的經過，也不很淸楚。水手叛變，埃哈用武力制止的情節，亦沒有明白表出。</p>
<p>本片的劇情是取材於ＨＥＲＭＡＮＭＥＬＶＩＬＬＥ的小說ＭＬＯＢＹＤＩＣＫ。時代是一八三八年至一八五○年，所以仍用十九世紀的服裝。片中的海船和捕鯨幾幕攝影甚　。埃哈和牧師女　絲在國中會面一幕的佈影和光線很柔媚。碼頭和客棧　幕光線太差，這　者是要顯出十九世紀時的狀况罷，然而新加坡一幕却又很精彩。這部影片有點像從前的無聲片的配音翻版，但不加以肯定。</p>
<p>約翰巴里　飾劇　英雄　　　表演出色賣力。瓊彭納特飾牧師女緋絲也很柔媚動人。她的說白最淸脆可聽。全片祇有個人的動作，沒有怎麽導演可說，因之一幕一幕似斷似續：其餘演員不過隨聲附和而已。</p>
<h3>瓊克勞馥和小范朋克　終久宣告離異了</h3>
<p>— 竹仙</p>
<p>喧傳已久的瓊克勞馥與小范朋克的離婚案，現在已經告一結束。五月份的美國電影雜誌，都各有一篇文字，記載這件美國影界最近發生的大事。很可笑的她們却自己說自己的玄章，是瓊克勞馥的特别談話，爲他報所不能得到的，但是各報居然都有了。現在我且把各種電影雜誌上的記載，彚合起來，採集其大要如下：</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥與小范朋克並非離婚，而是分手，這是瓊克勞馥向各電影雜誌記者宣佈中最要緊的一點。離婚與分手不同之點：爲倘使離婚了，以後男婚女嫁，各聽自便，不受他方之干涉；但他們僅是分手，雙方各無婚嫁之意。他們現在不過分居，並未履行離婚的法律手續，所以倘使他們一方將來要重娶或再嫁時，這離婚的法律手續，這是要補行的。</p>
<p>這種離異，雖僅稱爲分手，（ＳＥＰＡＲＡＴＩＯＮ）但已經雙方同意，具有法律上的效力，卽雙力不再履行夫婦間同居之義務，故亦稱爲「合法的分居」（ＬＥＧＡＬＳＰＡＲＡＴＩＯＮ）。法律上是否有此條文或名稱，此處不加深究，但知瓊克勞馥與小范朋克二人都已同意堅守不渝而已。或謂他們此次分居，或僅是暫時的，將來或仍有合居的希望。但據接近雙方的人說，他們已决無再行同居之可能。其緣因係他們這次分手，係出於無可奈何中最後之决定。據云他們實際上離異了已經八個月，而在這八個月之中，他們亦曾想盡了方法，去恢復從前戀愛的程度，但是統通都失敗了。他們亦曾去遊歷歌洲，想藉此第二蜜月的力量，挽回已經老去的蘿蔓絲，不幸那次第二蜜月，僅如减除痛苦的麻醉劑，能暫時地减除痛苦，而病源絲毫未去。所以他們回到好萊塢之後，就立卽發現他們已往的往愛情，永無回復之希望了。於是他們經過長期的考慮，互相商榷，並且得到經騐豐富的老范朋克的贊同而分手了。這樣是地出之於十二分審愼的處置，是不留再合的餘地的。</p>
<p>他們離異的緣因是什麽呢？據瓊克勞馥的自述，是與忌妒毫無關係，亦無第三者摻雜其頀。她說她喜歡男朋友，但是她的男朋友，亦都是她丈夫的朋友；她喜歡跳舞，但她出去的時候，她的丈夫常一同出去，或必有其他的朋友陪伴同去，而從來沒有單身人同一個男朋友出去過。至於她丈夫的女朋友她亦都認識，並且常常請她們到家裏來。所以她個人和她的丈夫都沒有與他人發生戀愛之事。這就是這次僅言分手而不提及離婚的緣故。瓊個人無再嫁之意。她說「我第一次婚姻，旣已失敗了；何必再試第二次呢？至於島格拉斯（小范朋克之名）在最近期内，亦决無重婚之意。」</p>
<p>那末他們到底爲什麽到分手呢？且等明日再講。</p>

<p>本刋日前登載克萊拉寳在法國，不購外國衣飾，而專採用美國本國物品一節，頗引起本刋閱者相當的好評，說這位熱女郎熱心國貨與我國的時髦女子不同。現在消息傳來，這個寳女士已在貧苦家屬之中領養雙生男女一對，可見愛國始於愛家：爲善必自兄弟始。頗見我國一般「吃善飯」的，在外面整千整萬的賙濟貧人，而遠房親戚向他借貸一二番，即白眼向人，於此可見他的「善」是假的而他的富足，亦是竊人身上刮來的，克萊拉寳和她的丈夫李克斯貝爾，自歐　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　故居。她對於貧苦戚屬多有饋贈，至少使之一冬無凉餒之虞。在美國這種不景氣之中，這種善舉，寳在造福他們不少。有一天他們夫婦二人走到一個竊本家家裏看了這可愛的麗琳，就想領她到好萊塢去。但麗琳和約翰非但是雙生子，並且極爲友愛。約翰看見麗琳要離他而去，悲從中來，就哭了。後後來克萊拉不顧見他們從母貽裏雙生下來的兄妹，受兩樣的敎育待遇，將來成爲兩個階級的人，所以連約翰也帶走了。</p>

<h3>電影小說四十一街４２ＮＤＳＴＲＥＥＴ（四）</h3>
<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>歌舞練習散班的時候，潘特還在戲院外面。潘特眼見着陶樂賽偕着亞布納狄龍跑開，心　覺得懊喪，但是他看見了潘琪的時候，精神又大爲振作。潘特比皮萊年紀大些，但在某一點上也比他漂亮些。潘特向潘琪略加勾引，便同她去吃夜飯。晚餐後，他們又同乘公共汽車回到四十二街，彼此談來已成知己。潘琪見着潘特有點悶悶不樂，就問他什麽事使他傷心。潘特便慘笑着把他同另外一個成功的歌舞女星的戀愛史傾心相告，並且請求她對這事的意見，潘琪便勸他重新做起。</p>
<p>在關閉房門以前，潘琪頻頻回顧，表示默視潘特晚安。在她再後一顧的當兒，她幣見街沿石上兩個黑影迫近他的身子。其中一個恰發出聲音說話。</p>
<p>「我們有一個信帶給呌潘特但寗的，」他恐嚇着說。「倘使他不丢開陶樂賽布樂克，那就要給他一個難看丨丨但寗，知道沒有？」</p>
<p>對方面回答一言未了，那個人便右手伸，重重地給潘特一拳。潘特應聲跌倒在地，第一個流氓立卽跳人等待着的汽車，第二個流氓却仍停留着用力痛踢跌倒的人的肚旁骨，然後跟着躍人汽車揚長而去。</p>

<h3>Commemorating the May Third Incident</h3>
<p>Today marks the fifth anniversary of the May Third Jinan Massacre. The occurrence of the May Third Incident was due to the expansion of revolutionary forces in our country. As the Northern Warlords were successively overthrown, the power of imperialists in China also began to waver. Therefore, when the National Revolutionary Army's second Northern Expedition progressed to Shandong, Japanese imperialists brazenly revealed their true aggressive colors under the guise of "protecting overseas Chinese." They openly dispatched troops to Shandong for the second time to secretly aid the warlords and obstruct the progress of revolutionary forces. At the same time, they occupied Jinan, indiscriminately bombing, slaughtering, and wreaking havoc. In this page of tragic and humiliating history, we can clearly see that imperialists, in order to maintain their interests in colonies, will exert all their strength to suppress the revolutionary forces in those colonies and support their existing powers. The occurrence of the May Third Incident was precisely the implementation of this aggressive policy.</p>
<p>"May Third" marks its fifth anniversary today, meaning we have commemorated "May Third" four times in the past. What have we gained from those four commemorations? Blood and tears, sighs, meaningless moans, and futile anger. However, the humiliation of the old "May Third" has not been washed away in the slightest, and new national humiliations continue to unfold. Since September 18th, the humiliation our nation has suffered is ten or a hundred times greater than that of "May Third." The oppression and trampling of our country by Japanese imperialists is also ten or a hundred times greater than that of "May Third." Old wounds have not healed, and new wounds cover our entire body. Therefore, will our commemoration of "May Third" today be just like the past four times, a mere formality? Will we continue to weep and lament, simply offering another memorial to the past?</p>
<p>We believe that commemorating "May Third" today is of even greater significance than in the past. Firstly, due to the intensification of the capitalist economic crisis, imperialists, in order to struggle for their dying breaths, are not only suppressing revolutionary forces and supporting existing powers in colonies and semi-colonies, but are also demanding a re-division of colonies. Thus, our country, the center of the Far East problem, is surrounded by the world and finds itself in an extremely difficult and precarious situation. Secondly, since September 18th, Japanese imperialists have intensified their aggression against us step by step, but our entire country has not been able to actively resist them. The enemy's desires are endless, while our dreams of complacency continue. This is no different than showing that our nation has lost its ability to maintain its survival and is willing to be slaughtered. Therefore, the practical problem facing us today is how to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialists and how to strive for the survival and freedom of our nation.</p>
<p>In summary, under the current circumstances, the only way for us to wash away the humiliations of the past is through resistance. The only way to maintain the survival of our nation is also through "resistance." Only resistance is enough to commemorate the past "May Third," and only resistance is enough to stop the continued unfolding of new national humiliations. Otherwise, what is the point of commemoration? What is the point of moaning?</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Focus</p>
<p>Shifts to the Far East Question</p>
<p>Yenching University President Summoned to the White House</p>
<p>To Contribute Opinions on the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>Minister Song to Arrive in the US Within Days</p>
<p>Gu and Guo's Trip to Washington Cancelled</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - US President Roosevelt began to study the Far East problem in detail today. Dr. Stuart, President of Yenching University in Peiping, has been ordered by the President to submit his impressions and suggestions regarding Japan's military actions in mainland China within the next few days. It is reported that Dr. Stuart will suggest that Western countries support China with political and economic power to maintain its territorial integrity. Dr. Stuart was summoned to the White House today to express his views on Japan's invasion of mainland China. As a result of the conversation, the President ordered him to submit a written opinion within 24 hours. Afterwards, Dr. Stuart met with reporters and stated that he believed the Sino-Japanese crisis had reached a point where all countries should take joint action. He does not advocate the use of force and believes there is no need for it. Japan's invasion of mainland China is completely without justification and violates not only existing treaties between the two countries, but also the international law protecting law and order. Even if the United States alone were to aid China with political and economic means, he does not see the possibility of triggering a Japanese-American war. It is noted that the US President's sudden study of the Far East problem has caused surprise in the US capital. Outside sources speculate that the conflict on the Manchurian-Russian border also had at least some influence. According to seemingly accurate information received by the US government, the puppet government has threatened Soviet Russia. If Russia does not grant all of the puppet state's demands regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway incident, it will use force. Therefore, the situation is quite serious. Furthermore, Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen is about to arrive in the United States. Therefore, the US President is collecting information in advance and summoning Dr. Stuart to seek his opinion. The White House talks this week are scheduled for representatives from Argentina, Italy, Germany, and China.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that the trips of Gu Weijun and Guo Taiqi to Washington have both been cancelled. However, the National Government hopes that at least one of the two will go to the United States by mid-May to assist Finance Minister Song in carrying out all matters. Gu recently telegraphed from Paris, saying that he is suffering from insomnia due to overwork in Geneva and wishes to rest for a while. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Today, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi met with US President's representative in Europe, Davis, to discuss recent developments in the Far East. Ambassador Guo told Davis that recent rumors that China is willing to negotiate a truce are completely unfounded. China is determined to continue to resist the Japanese invasion.

<p>US Government Instructs Davis</p>

<p>(New York) The US government today instructed its representative in London, Davis, to urge the immediate establishment of a tariff truce. Even if it is attached with the reservation that Britain and France have the right to levy additional taxes if the US dollar depreciates, it is still acceptable. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Dalian Newspaper Publishes</p>
<p>Statistics on Northeastern Anti-Japanese Armies</p>
<p>(Dalian) According to statistics published today by a certain Dalian newspaper, a year ago, there were 230,000 righteous volunteers in the Three Northeastern Provinces. However, only 60,000 remain now. Moreover, the current volunteers are extremely lacking in military supplies and seem to be living by begging. The loss of Jehol has cut off the supply routes. The existing volunteers have all become armed refugees. The volunteers in Heilongjiang were extremely active in the spring and summer of last year, but now there are fewer than 3,000 remaining. There are currently 25,000 volunteers in Jilin Province, making it the province with the most volunteers in the Three Northeastern Provinces. These are mostly subordinates of Wang Delin, Li Du, etc., who have not retreated into Russian territory. The remaining volunteers have moved to Heilongjiang. There are currently 13,000 volunteers in Liaoning Province, mostly located in the Tongping area. There are currently 6,000 volunteers in western Jehol, as well as 10,000 genuine bandits.

<p>Chinese Eastern Railway Dispute</p>
<p>Russian Aircraft Reconnoiter Border</p>
<p>Russian-Japanese Situation Increasingly Dangerous</p>
<p>Russian General Manager Sends Letter Replying to the Puppet Manchurian Government</p>
<p>Reiterating Ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>The Puppet State Resolves to Block Transportation on the Suifen River</p>
<p>Russian Customs Officials on the Border Begin to Withdraw</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Russian-Manchurian dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway is now becoming increasingly serious. Soviet Russia has announced that it will not return the vehicles that have withdrawn into Russian territory, and Soviet Russian customs officials in Manzhouli and Suifenhe have withdrawn into Russian territory. Soviet Russian aircraft are now extremely active along the border area. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to a report from the Manzhouli border guard, two Soviet Russian military aircraft have been flying over the border area in recent days. This is the first time since the Sino-Russian War of 1929 that Russian aircraft have approached the border, which shows the severity of the Russian-Manchurian situation. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The dispute between Soviet Russia and the puppet organization over the ownership and operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway has intensified today after receiving the puppet organization's formal report denying Soviet Russia's sole ownership. Today, the Soviet Russian government published continued reports on the negotiations between the Russian representative of the railway and the puppet authorities, and claimed that it had instructed the Russian representative to insist on the immediate restoration of normal conditions and to strictly abide by the Beijing and Shenyang agreements. At this time, Soviet Russia is demanding complete ownership of the railway in accordance with the two agreements. Therefore, one of the documents exchanged between the two parties in Harbin, published today, pointed out that Soviet Russia's opening of some locomotives into Russian territory was an illegal unilateral action. However, today the Russian government no longer debated the ownership of the vehicles in the communique, claiming that the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements explicitly recognize the Chinese Eastern Railway as Soviet Russian property. Therefore, it is stipulated that China can buy back the railway under certain conditions, which is clear evidence that China recognizes that the ownership of the railway belongs to Russia. The "interference of Manchurian officials" is a violation of the treaty. At this time, what the Russian government is demanding is only the immediate conclusion of a technical agreement for the operation of the railway. In addition, the Russian government also stated that if "Manchukuo" makes any further demands regarding the ownership of the railway, Soviet Russia will no longer pay attention to it. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The serious conflict between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" shows no sign of being resolved. Li Shaogeng, the puppet director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, sent a letter to the Russian General Manager Kosnitzky, denying that Soviet Russia enjoys ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Kosnitzky replied that Soviet Russian ownership is recorded in the clauses of the two treaties signed in Shenyang and Beiping. Now (Manchukuo) suddenly raises the issue of Soviet Russian ownership, causing people to fear that "Manchukuo's" purpose is to destroy these two treaties. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Japanese authorities are taking a cold attitude towards the dispute between Soviet Russia and the "puppet state" over the Chinese Eastern Railway and continue to claim that this case will not have major developments, according to reports from Changchun, the authorities there believe that this dispute can only be resolved if Soviet Russia agrees to cancel the 1924 Shenyang Agreement and conclude a new treaty. The new treaty must have equal clauses. The Soviet Russian government's second protest to Changchun accused the "Russian-Manchukuo" of violating the Shenyang Agreement. The "puppet Manchukuo" government claimed that "Manchukuo" had not violated anything, because the agreement was signed by the former government, and the Soviet Russian government took advantage of the weakness of the former government to achieve it. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Dalian) After Kosnitzky sent the third reply to Li Shaogeng regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, the "puppet Manchukuo" government decided to block transportation on the Suifen River, causing great tension among the people. Kosnitzky's letter still insisted that the Chinese Eastern Railway belongs to Soviet Russia. The "puppet Manchukuo" government declared that the Soviet Russian reply makes a peaceful resolution impossible. It is also rumored that on April 23, two Soviet Russian aircraft invaded Manchurian territory and flew over Pingyang Town, about fifteen miles from the Russian-Manchurian border. This incident also caused unease among the people. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Harbin Times, a Japanese-run newspaper, today published a harsh editorial on the Russian-Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway dispute, stating: "The thieves of the Chinese Eastern Railway and their associates should be held fully responsible for this matter. As for the relationship between Russia and Manchuria, it will depend on the attitude of Soviet Russia." The newspaper also said that the Chinese Eastern Railway does not belong to Soviet Russia, because Karakhan had already briefly stated in his note to China on September 27, 1930 that Soviet Russia was abandoning its ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, the Chinese Eastern Railway already belongs to China. Now, the Russian Deputy Director Kosnitzky still insists that the Chinese Eastern Railway belongs to Russia, presumably having forgotten Karakhan's previous note. Finally, the newspaper said that the Russian side should quickly return the vehicles of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Currently, in the Chinese Eastern Railway dispute, neither the Russian nor the Manchurian side is willing to concede. Officials are generally pessimistic about this, and Soviet Russia has stopped returning vehicles, even refusing to release freight cars. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>League of Nations Advisory Committee to Decide</p>
<p>On Measures for Non-Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>League of Nations Secretariat Has Distributed Report to All Members</p>
<p>Advisory Committee May Convene This Week</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat has drafted various issues related to the non-recognition of "Manchukuo" and will distribute them to the members of the subcommittee handling the issue. The committee is scheduled to meet at the end of this week to discuss everything. It is heard that the report did not make any suggestions, which is naturally not within the scope of the Secretariat's authority. The report only examines all international relations of non-recognition of "Manchukuo," as this move involves currency, passports, postal and telecommunications, consular status, etc. The subcommittee will submit recommendations to the Twenty-Two Committee, which was appointed by the League of Nations General Assembly to assist in fulfilling its responsibilities. The Twenty-Two Committee may convene this week. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) A certain Japanese advisor to "Manchukuo" recently claimed that those who do not recognize "Manchukuo" cannot enjoy preferential tariffs. A question was therefore raised in the British House of Commons today. Lord President of the Council Baldwin replied on behalf of Foreign Secretary Simon, who was unwell, that the maintenance of the open-door policy in Manchuria is enshrined in the treaty. The comments of a certain advisor obviously contradict the repeated declarations of the Japanese government and the Manchurian authorities. If Japan and Manchuria were to break their declaration of an open door, the British government would take any possible steps to defend this principle. However, he has not received any news of this action by Japan and Manchuria. Given the previous statements of Japan and Manchuria, the words of a certain advisor are difficult to believe.

<p>Bandits Still Active in Newchwang</p>
<p>(Dalian) Bandits are still active in Newchwang. Although the authorities speak of suppressing bandits every day, it is ineffective. Recently, there was another case of a certain Chinese businessman being kidnapped. One morning, two people arrived at a certain merchant's house in a car, saying that the court had summoned him. The merchant then went with them. His daughter also went to the door and saw nothing unusual. Unexpectedly, he never returned. It is heard that the merchant was coerced by the bandits and changed to a small boat midway to cross the river, heading towards the bandit den in Panshan. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Result of Matsudaira's Appeal to England</p>
<p>Britain Proposes to Japan</p>
<p>Holding a London Conference</p>
<p>To Discuss Preventing Trade Competition Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Japan is Skeptical but Principally Expresses Acceptance</p>
<p>The Turkish-Japanese Commercial Treaty Extended for Three Months</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, the Japanese government received a suggestion from Minister Runciman of the British Board of Trade, relayed by Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira, advocating that British and Japanese industrialists hold a conference in London to discuss various commercial matters between Britain and Japan. Japan seems likely to accept this proposal. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Minister Runciman of the Board of Trade, through Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira, proposed to Japan the suggestion of a gathering of British and Japanese industrialists in London to discuss commerce between the two countries. People in the Manchester cotton industry are cautiously in favor of this proposal, hoping to improve the position of the British cotton industry, which is severely affected by Japanese goods. There are also those who oppose this proposal, because it is tantamount to admitting Britain's weakness. Opponents advocate raising tariffs on Japanese goods entering the British Empire. The Manchester Royal Exchange approved the request of the Cotton Goods Alliance, and members of the exchange signed a letter to the government requesting a ban on foreign countries expanding their commerce in British Empire markets. This is truly an unprecedented move. The panic in Lancashire can be seen from this. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the United Kingdom cancelled the Japanese-Indian Commercial Treaty, Matsudaira, the Japanese ambassador to the United Kingdom, contacted the British government authorities several times under the order of Foreign Minister Uchida. Minister Runciman of the British Board of Trade proposed an agreement on markets to the Japanese ambassador. Matsudaira immediately telegraphed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. The outline of the British proposal is as follows: (1) Matters related to the cancellation of the Indian-Japanese Commercial Treaty and the Indian Industries Protection Act should be discussed from a global perspective to find remedies. Partial consultations are of no avail. (2) The United Kingdom wants to use this opportunity to include the area where British and Japanese goods compete in all British territories and world markets as the scope of consultation and jointly study methods of ceasing conflict and forming a comprehensive agreement. (3) To achieve this goal, the British government sincerely hopes that both countries will appoint members, or that industrialists from both countries will organize a joint committee to cease conflict to resolve the economic conflicts between the two countries, agree on markets, and not infringe on their interests. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon receiving this report, forwarded it to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry will convene a meeting of representatives from the economic sector to determine countermeasures. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed acceptance of this proposal in principle. (1st China United Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting of its leadership to study the British proposal for a British-Japanese Trade Agreement Committee. After exchanging opinions with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, it expressed its approval in principle of the British proposal. However, there are major questions about the matters that should be discussed by the operators of both countries, such as (1) the scope of the market that should be agreed upon, (2) whether it includes the Indian market, (3) whether the market agreement extends to an agreement on the control of exports and restrictions on production in their own countries, (4) the relationship with tariff agreements, and (5) the scope of commodities applicable to the trade agreement, such as varieties. As details are unknown, they all dare not make trade promises and have telegraphed Ambassador Matsudaira to inquire about the detailed intentions of the British government. (2nd Denstu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the British Minister's proposal, although the Japanese business community has not discussed it, their opinions and predictions are roughly as follows: (1) Although the British proposal is not a bad way to break the deadlock, it is difficult to predict its intentions, or it may be a trick to avoid discussing Japanese-Indian trade. (2) The problem is currently occurring in India, but the scope of the agreement is the entire British territory and the world cloth market, which proves that the British colonies will adopt an offensive policy towards Japanese goods. No matter how it ends, Japanese goods imported into the British colonies will be affected. (3) The reason why the British included the markets of Southeast Asia and China in the scope of consultation is that they intend to demand that Japanese goods withdraw from British colonies in exchange. Japan has nothing to gain. The Japanese business community said that if the consultation is not done properly, it may cause a full-scale conflict between Britain and Japan. Therefore, the Japanese side should carefully study countermeasures. (2nd China United Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Turkish-Japanese Provisional Commercial Agreement will expire on the 6th. According to a telegram from Murakami, the acting ambassador to Turkey, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Turkey and Japan have extended the validity of the provisional agreement by three months to avoid being a country without a treaty. During that time it will remain in effect, with an unofficial understanding having been reached. (2nd Denstu Telegram)</p>

Among them, the black background with large white characters is posted by an organization calling itself the Asia-British United Association. Most of them criticize Britain for disregarding British-Japanese friendship, repaying kindness with ingratitude, forcing Japan to accept an inappropriate naval ratio at the Washington Conference, and encouraging anti-Japanese sentiment in Geneva, and demanding the liberation of India to free it from the yoke of British rule, and gathering 400 million Chinese people and 300 million Indian people to drive British forces west of the Suez Canal.

<p>Roosevelt to Attend as a Guest</p>
<p>At the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>Formal Decision on Japanese Representative Candidates</p>
<p>Six-Province Joint Conference Formulates Guiding Principles</p>
<p>(New York) According to a Washington visitor today, President Roosevelt may attend the World Economic Conference to be held in London in mid-June, but the President will only attend as a guest, not as a representative of the United States. He plans to invite former Ohio Governor Cox to join the US delegation attending the World Economic Conference and has specially asked for his consent. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning's cabinet meeting formally approved the dispatch of Ishii, Matsudaira, and Fukai as Japanese representatives to the World Economic Conference. Afterwards, Matsuoka reported on the beginning and end of attending the League of Nations meeting to pass the Lytton Report. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's countermeasures for the World Economic Conference were formulated in the original draft at the six-province joint conference on the 1st and have been approved by the cabinet. The content is divided into two parts: the first part is the countermeasures for the London Conference, and the second part is the countermeasures for the Washington Conference, to abolish the extreme policy. The content is described as follows: (A) "Countermeasures for the London Conference" (1) (Monetary and Credit Policy) Before restoring the gold standard, the freedom of capital movement must be resolved first. The gold standard issue must be resolved in connection with the country's credit. Credit policy should adopt the cooperation of central banks of various countries. As for raising the price of silver to increase the purchasing power of the Far East market, it is a method that Japan desperately desires. The silver issue is about stability, not price increases. (2) (Price Policy) Japan's national conditions require high prices. Within the scope that can accommodate Japan's special circumstances, Japan is willing to accept world control. (3) (Capital Movement) Reopening the path of capital movement includes various methods such as canceling restrictions on exchange, changing short-term national debt to long-term debt, and using the Bank for International Settlements. However, Japan advocates free passage as a basic countermeasure. (4) (International Trade) Cancel all kinds of restrictions on national defense trade, but rice is not governed by this principle. (5) (Tariffs and Commercial Treaties) Free trade and tariff barrier reductions are new trade principles, but Japan is unwilling to reduce its tariffs equally with other countries. (6) (Production and Transactions) Restrictions on production and export should be free to each country, without any international pressure. (B) "Countermeasures for the Washington Conference" (1) Japan cancels its extreme policy on any issue that restricts Japanese national policy. (2) Regarding the Far East issue and the Manchurian issue, actively seek American understanding. (3) When all resolutions reach the final voting stage, strive for Japan's unique circumstances. If understanding cannot be reached, then agree with conditions. (4) Military disarmament opposes the same degree of reduction as other countries for reasons of Far Eastern political affairs. (5) Matters that have already been agreed upon between the United States and the United States, if they do not violate Japan's stated special circumstances, need not be opposed.

<p>Issues Decree to Comfort the People of Xinjiang</p>
<p>Jin Shuren Approved to be Relieved of All Concurrent Positions</p>
<p>Huang Musong Has Arrived in Nanjing and is Preparing to Depart for Xinjiang</p>

He is ordered to come to Nanjing immediately and await further appointment.</p>
<p>The order further stated that national equality and freedom of religion are the basic tenets of our Party and the essential principles of the Provisional Constitution. The National Government has consistently adhered to these principles in its governance of the border provinces. Xinjiang, located in the remote western region, suffers from poor transportation, making communication with the Central Government difficult and preventing the people's concerns from being fully conveyed. However, the Muslim and other peoples of the province are known to the Central Government for their sincerity, honesty, law-abiding nature, and diligence. In recent years, the country has faced many difficulties, and we have not had time to look westward. The people of Xinjiang have been able to maintain their patriotic enthusiasm, understand the government's hardships, and work diligently, contributing greatly to the prosperity of the Republic of China and the unity of the nation. The Central Government has always instructed the border officials to diligently seek the people's concerns and consolidate the border areas. Unexpectedly, since taking office, the Chairman of the province, Jin Shuren, has failed to uphold the intentions of the Central Government in all his actions, leading to this incident, which is deeply regrettable. Now that Chairman Jin Shuren has resigned to take responsibility, the Central Government has approved it and is carefully selecting virtuous individuals to properly manage the area, and has specially appointed Huang Musong, the Vice Chief of Staff of the General Staff Headquarters, as the Xinjiang Envoy to pacify the people, improve the local area, and settle the soldiers and civilians. It is hoped that the people of Xinjiang will understand this intention, abide by their occupations, wait quietly for the process, and not gather in crowds to cause hidden worries. This is our great hope. (2nd, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Peruvian President Assassinated</p>
<p>Shot by Opposition Party During Military Parade</p>
<p>Assassins and Guards Killed and Wounded</p>
<p>New President Elected, Nationwide Martial Law Declared</p>
<p>Associated Press, Lima, 30th - Peruvian President Cerro was shot and assassinated today at the Tapetitrique racetrack after finishing a military parade. He died shortly after at an Italian hospital. The Peruvian Congress immediately convened an emergency meeting tonight and, within minutes, elected General Benavides, former president and commander of the air force, as the new president. Benavides was inaugurated tonight and declared nationwide martial law. At the same time, the Peruvian cabinet resigned as a matter of course, but the new president announced tonight that he would try to retain them.</p>
<p>Former Peruvian President Cerro, wanting to deal with the undeclared war with Colombia abroad and suppress the rebellions that have been occurring in various parts of the country since last year, had conscripted 20,000 reservists aged between 21 and 23 in February. Today was their first inspection. After the military parade, as he and his cabinet were leaving the field, he was suddenly shot. Multiple opposition party members crowded next to the president's car, and three people jumped onto the running board and opened fire. The first bullet hit the president's vital parts, and he fell into the car. The guards opened fire in retaliation, and there was indiscriminate shooting. The leader of the assassins was killed on the spot. Two soldiers were killed and five were wounded. One of the assassins was seriously wounded, and the rest were arrested. The president was rushed to the Italian hospital after being injured, but died of his injuries.</p>
<p>According to the assassin, the incident was purely political in nature. Since the civil unrest that had been occurring in various places last year and the establishment of the new constitution in February of this year, all political parties had been dissolved, but they continued to operate in practice. Among them was the radical Revolutionary Alliance Party, which called for major political reforms, the overthrow of large landowners, and the implementation of a completely new financial system. The president then ordered the ban on its meetings and the prohibition of the party's slogans. Although the president was intimidated at the time, he was unmoved. The party then claimed that during visits to political prisoners, they discovered that several party members had been secretly executed. Opposition to the government intensified. The assassin, named Dimendo Chai, was a member of the party. The new president, after taking office tonight, ordered the arrest of the party's leaders. Several people have already been arrested.</p>
<p>All government offices across the country are under strict guard, but the capital is as peaceful as usual, and there are no reports of unrest from the provinces. The new president belongs to the Revolutionary Union, the same party as the former president. It is expected that his policies will not change much.</p>
<p>Reuters, Peruvian Capital, 30th - After the assassination of Peruvian President Cerro, there was a clash between soldiers and civilians on the road. Several people were killed and many were injured on both sides.</p>
<p>Reuters, Peruvian Capital, 1st - Martial law has been declared throughout Peru. The new president, General Pinavites, who was appointed by the cabinet last night, was formerly the ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>American Shipbuilding Plan</p>

Afterwards, Swanson told people that he hoped that the president would include a shipbuilding fund of $460 million in the public works bill to be submitted to Congress within two weeks. Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, had previously suggested a public works construction fund of $300 million, with $30 million allocated to shipbuilding.</p>
<p>British Parliament Discusses</p>
<p>New Anglo-German Trade Agreement</p>
<p>Anglo-Argentine Trade Agreement Signed</p>
<p>Close Cooperation Sought Between Britain and Persia</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - The recent Anglo-German trade agreement was the subject of criticism in the House of Commons today. Minister of Trade Runciman moved to reduce the existing tariffs related to this agreement. Austin Chamberlain, because the Birmingham constituency he represents will be hit by this agreement, especially the jewelry industry, denounced the Anglo-German trade agreement as useless to Britain. He proposed that the House adjourn so that it could consult with all parties concerned. Former Colonial Secretary Amery and Alexander, chairman of the British Manufacturers' Association, both agreed with Chamberlain's remarks. Alexander said that the tariffs produced by the Ottawa Conference and the British Imperial Tariff Advisory Board may be severely damaged by this agreement. Furthermore, the government did not consult with all parties concerned before the agreement was concluded. Runciman claimed that if Chamberlain's motion was passed by the House, the government would not be able to conduct trade agreement negotiations. He has already achieved a good trade agreement. If the House does not want it, then he will have to find someone else to negotiate. Chamberlain's motion was then put to a vote and rejected by 269 votes to 80. Runciman's proposal to reduce the various tariffs related to this agreement was passed by 285 votes to 33.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - The newly concluded treaty between Britain and Argentina was signed today at the Foreign Office. Foreign Secretary Simon could not attend due to a cold, so Trade Minister Runciman represented Britain in signing the agreement.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - According to the Daily Express, the compromise between Britain and Persia over the oil dispute has opened the way for a British-Persian treaty. The King of Persia has agreed to send a plenipotentiary to London to negotiate a treaty so that the two countries can closely cooperate in commerce and diplomacy. The treaty will specifically address the elimination of Soviet Russian influence on the Northern Persian Railway and connect Iraq and India by rail.</p>

<p>Investigation of the Japanese Army's Invasion of Northeast Troops</p>
<p>Five Divisions and Three Independent Brigades</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch: Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have successively fallen. However, the Japanese military strength is no more than five divisions and three independent mixed brigades, totaling no more than 80,000 to 90,000 people. We, on the other hand, mobilized a large number of troops, no less than 300,000 to 400,000 people. The bloody resistance at various passes of the Great Wall can demonstrate the spirit of our soldiers in resisting aggression. The reason for the failure is the lack of a complete line of resistance, resulting in inaction at the tail when striking the head, and inaction at the head when striking the tail. This is the biggest reason for the failure. Secondly, our weapons are inferior to those of the enemy. According to a certain important person, apart from airplanes and tanks being unique to the enemy, our guns and artillery are also inferior in comparison. Often, the enemy has ten machine guns, while we only have four. The enemy has ten artillery pieces, while we only have two. The enemy's transportation is by car, while ours is by mule cart. The enemy's ammunition is replenished by air, while ours is replenished by manpower. This is another reason for the failure. Now, an investigation table of the Japanese army's invading Northeast troops is recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Bloody Battle of Nantianmen</p>
<p>Talks with Company Commander Lin of the Huang Division</p>
<p>Japanese Army Relying on Artillery Barrage</p>
<p>Our Officers and Soldiers Advanced in the Face of Bullets</p>
<p>Shixia Communication: Since the enemy army began attacking our Nantianmen position on the morning of April 21st, our brave officers and soldiers have fought bloody battles for several days. Thousands of national heroes have completed their mission and returned to paradise. The enemy has paid an extremely high price and still cannot gain an inch of land in Nantianmen. Now they are urgently mobilizing reinforcements, plotting to launch another attack. It is expected that there will be a more intense war in the near future. The following is a detailed record of the battles of the past few days, according to Company Commander Lin of Huang Jie's unit:</p>
<p>On the 21st, just as the morning light was dawning, six or seven enemy planes suddenly appeared in the air above our position, circling up and down. The enemy artillery took them as targets and concentrated their fire for a fierce barrage. At the same time, more than 2,000 Mongolian and puppet soldiers also attacked our Nantianmen and Badaolouzi area under the cover of their artillery fire. Their target was particularly focused on the left-wing Badaolouzi position, which was higher than Nantianmen and extremely dangerous. At this time, only one battalion of our defending soldiers was stationed here. After several hours of fighting, the position had been leveled by bombardment, and casualties were more than half. However, our officers and soldiers were all calm and resisted the enemy. Even if they died until the last person, they would not retreat. Those who were injured and fell to the ground still struggled to crawl forward until they fell to their deaths. A certain platoon leader was injured and replaced by a sergeant. The entire platoon was surrounded by Japanese soldiers and fought for three days and nights. They still led more than 20 people to break through the encirclement and return to the camp to report. The bravery of our officers and soldiers and their determination to die for the country can be seen from this. However, the battalion has almost all been killed or wounded. As a result, Badaolouzi was once captured by the enemy. Although our reinforcements had rushed to the scene, they had to temporarily hold the nearby high ground because the enemy's artillery fire was too fierce. That night at 8 o'clock, Division Commander Huang Jie took advantage of the darkness and ordered a counterattack. Our loyal and brave officers and soldiers advanced in the face of bullets. The enemy still drove the Mongolian and puppet soldiers in front and supervised the battle from behind with machine guns and artillery. When the puppet soldiers came into contact with our army, the Japanese army concentrated its firepower on the battle line, regardless of friend or foe. Their intention was not only to eliminate our army, but also to eliminate the puppet army in one fell swoop. From this, we can see the cunning of the Japanese pirates and the pitifulness and hatred of the puppet army. Although our army suffered many casualties in this battle, the enemy suffered even more than us. After a night of hard fighting, the Badaolouzi position was finally recovered by our army. On the 22nd, the enemy sent more than a thousand people to detour to our left wing. The situation was very critical. Division Commander Huang personally led the entire 8th Regiment to run forward and meet them head-on. The enemy's plan failed again. Our army took advantage of this opportunity to launch a rapid attack. The smoke was misty and the screams shook the field. The enemy army was panicked and suffered heavy losses. On the 24th, the enemy launched an attack on us with even greater force, with thousands of Mongolian, puppet, and Japanese soldiers divided into several routes. The battle was even more tragic. However, our officers and soldiers still adhered to their patriotic enthusiasm and vowed to coexist with the position. It is still not possible to estimate how much more the Japanese will sacrifice to seize our Nantianmen position.</p>
<p>In this battle, the enemy's artillery fire played the greatest role. In Badaolouzi alone, more than 3,000 shells landed. Not only was the battlefield leveled, but even the stones were pulverized. Therefore, our sacrifices were extremely large. Two battalion commanders were killed and three were injured. More than 2,000 officers and soldiers were injured. The enemy, on the other hand, took the offensive and suffered even more casualties than us. Furthermore, the power of the enemy's aircraft in this battle was very weak and not worth fearing. When our Division Commander Huang led the entire regiment to run forward to meet the enemy detouring to our left wing, dozens of enemy planes followed and dropped bombs, but our army did not suffer any casualties.

<p>Reorganization of the Beiping Political Council</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo Comes North to Negotiate the Rate</p>
<p>Number of Committee Members Larger Than Before</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The politics of the northern provinces have always held a special status due to historical and geographical factors. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang, the Beiping Political Affairs Branch was established to manage everything as a transition mechanism between the central government and local areas. Zhang Ji was the chairman. Later, all political affairs branches across the country were abolished, and the council was dissolved. In the nineteenth year, Zhang Xueliang led his troops into the customs and established the Deputy Commander's Headquarters in addition to setting up political and military affairs committees to discuss military and political matters. This institution was not legally created by the central government, and its powers were limited. As the political situation evolved, the Deputy Commander's Headquarters became the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and then the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government. The original Military Affairs Committee was changed to the Military Training Committee due to a conflict in name. The Beiping Political Affairs Committee remained as before. Until Zhang Xueliang stepped down, the military affairs were managed by He Yingqin, who was sent by the central government. In terms of politics, it was also necessary to reorganize under a unified standard. The Central Political Committee recently decided to abolish the Beiping Political Affairs Committee and set up a legitimate institution. The central government, in order to be cautious due to the complexity of the political situation in the north and the special nature of the local areas, specially sent Chen Gongbo to the north to exchange opinions with various parties to avoid any obstacles. After arriving in Ping, Chen consulted with He Yingqin, Huang Shaohong, Jiang Bocheng, and others, and exchanged opinions with important figures in Pingjin. It is said that there have been considerable results. Generally, a political affairs institution will still be established in Ping. As for the name, the name of the former political affairs branch was explicitly abolished by the central government and is not suitable for re-mention. Most people advocate still calling it the Political Affairs Committee. In terms of organization, some advocate changing to a standing committee system, and some advocate setting up a chairman. After consultation, most people still think it is more convenient to set up a chairman. As for the number of committee members, I still remember that at the beginning of the establishment of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, there were eleven committee members, and Zhang Xueliang also served as the chairman. Later, Wang Yitang, Shi Yousan, Gu Zhongxiu, and others were hired as committee members, which resulted in fifteen people. In this reorganization, most people suggest slightly expanding the number of committee members, and all important figures from various factions should be recruited. It is said that Wang Yitang of the Duan faction, Zhang Zhitan of the Zhili faction, Liu Zhe and Wang Shuhan, important figures in the Northeast, Xiong Xiling, a famous figure, Wu Dingchang and Zhou Zuomin from the banking industry, are all on the list of recruits. Several people from the central government will participate, and the northern power factions will also recommend several people. The total number should be more than twenty. There is a saying that one of Zhang Ji, Li Shizeng, Huang Shaohong, and Huang Fu will be selected for the post of chairman, which can be announced after Chen Gongbo returns to Beijing for consultation.</p>
<p>The Military Affairs Committee was originally established to connect the feelings of the various armies, but since it was changed to the Military Training Committee, it has become nominal. Now that the northern military and political affairs are being reorganized, the committee has been ordered to be abolished. Yesterday, the committee removed the plaque in front of the door, and all places were completely closed. (April 29)</p>

<p>Large Conspiracy of Jiangxi Bandits</p>
<p>Main Bandit Forces Gather in the Upper Reaches of the Fu River</p>
<p>Create One Million Steel Red Army</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The 135th Army Corps, one of the main forces of the pseudo-First Front Army, is currently gathered in Fenggang, in the Yihuang, Le'an, and Chongren border area in the upper reaches of the Fu River. Zhu and Mao are traveling back and forth to recruit and command the Shuinan Dongbei Huangbei area. In recent days, the main bandit forces have launched attacks on Yihuang Chongren in several routes, and scattered bandits have sneaked into the territory of Linchuan to disrupt traffic in plainclothes and plan to invade Fuzhou. The Yunshan station bridge of the Gan-Min Road, 120 miles below Fuzhou from the province, was once destroyed by bandits on the evening of April 25. The next day, it was repelled by the military brigade. Automobiles from Nanchang to Fuzhou run as usual, and all parts of Fuzhou are heavily fortified, so they are extremely peaceful. Yesterday, a certain army seized a major conspiracy by the Red bandits' pseudo-Central Bureau and announced it. The relationship is extremely important. The content is as follows: (1) Create one million steel Red Army in all Soviet areas in China to fight against the imperialist Kuomintang army. The Gan and Min provinces must transport 10,000 new soldiers to the front in one month. (2) Call on all poor farmers and laborers to arm themselves and join the Red Guards and Young Pioneers, preparing to change from a voluntary military system to a militia system. (3) Independently and actively attack, contain and disturb the enemy, and destroy rear traffic, especially in the border areas of southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, the most powerful movement defense war must be carried out. (4) Borrow 200,000 stones of millet to help the revolutionary war. Public debt tickets in various places must be fully paid within the specified date. Workers and peasants save one copper coin every day to purchase airplanes and military aircraft. Mobilize women to manufacture 50,000 pairs of straw sandals and 50,000 pairs of overshoes to transport to the front. (5) The Provincial Committees of Jiangxi and Fujian should make their greatest efforts to immediately strengthen leadership over newly developed areas, such as Ningdu, Guangchang, Yihuang, Le'an, Nanfeng, Lichuan, and Shicheng in Jiangxi, and Jianning, Taining, Ninghua, Liancheng, Guihua, and Qingwan in Fujian.</p>

<p>Reader's Advisor</p>
<p>The Trend of Future World Wars</p>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Lu Sheng of this city丨</p>
<p>Dear Reporter: Since the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, it has strongly suppressed the open activities of the Communist Party on the one hand, and actively confronted France on the other. The European political situation has suddenly become extremely tense. As a result, the British Prime Minister personally visited Italy, ostensibly under the guise of a new disarmament conference, but in reality to discuss general important issues. Subsequently, the talks between the British and Italian Prime Ministers resulted in the cooperation of the four major European powers.</p>
<p>Originally, our observation of the world political situation in the past ten days was just as Mr. Nai in the Shen Bao's commentary said: "The mode of the Second World War will be a conflict between imperialist powers, rather than a united struggle of imperialist powers against the Soviet Union." However, the eve of the outbreak of war is precisely the time when the political situation changes most rapidly. My opinion is that the mode of the Second World War cannot be definitively determined to be a conflict between imperialist powers; in other words, the crisis of the imperialist powers jointly attacking the Soviet Union has not diminished slightly. Not only has it not diminished, but it has become increasingly acute. The best example is the recent incident in which the Soviet Union dealt with British engineers, which aroused a strong reaction from the British authorities; and the severe suppression of the Communist Party by the Italian and German Fascist parties, followed by the Soviet Union's protest against Hitler; and a few days ago, Japanese nationalists allowed White Russians to have political organizations at the border between the so-called "Manchurian" and Soviet countries; moreover, the leader of the anti-Soviet Union movement in Western Europe has shifted from France to the hands of the British Empire, and the person visited by the British Prime Minister this time is precisely Mussolini. What is the result of their talks? How to make the four major European powers cooperate? Since we know that the imperialist powers cannot cooperate due to conflicts of interest, does Mussolini not know this? The truth of the matter is that when the conflicts between the imperialist powers become acute, there is often some non-war treaty or some peace conference. On the one hand, it is to seek a temporary easing of the atmosphere between the imperialist powers, and at the same time, cooperation is only sought when attacking a common enemy. The European four-power cooperation advocated by Mussolini is nothing more than to ease the tense atmosphere between the four powers, and on the other hand, to actively unite to attack their common enemy - the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>Dear Reporter, because I cannot directly discuss this issue with Mr. Nai, I am writing a few words to ask you to reply to my opinion, what do you think?</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter disagrees with the Shen Bao Naijun's March 20th commentary on the world war situation [The mode of the Second World War will be a conflict between imperialist powers rather than a united struggle of imperialist powers against the Soviet Union.]'s assessment, arguing that "the crisis of the imperialist powers jointly attacking the Soviet Union has not diminished slightly." This issue is very serious, and the Chinese people have different ideas about these two arguments, that is, each has its own illusions. If we do not discuss in detail, recognize the future of international situation development, and determine the attitude that we Chinese people should take and the preparations for the major changes in the future, then it is really very dangerous. It should be solemnly raised and readers should pay full attention to it and discuss it carefully. This reporter is foolish to think that the discussion of this issue should not be based solely on a certain isolated matter, a certain diplomatic event, or a formal change in the international arena, but should pay attention to the following facts: (1) From the perspective of the class instinct of international imperialists, they are always trying to attack the Soviet Union, because there is something that can kill them "next to the bed", that is, the world has the other new thing of the Soviet Union's socialist federation, which is always enough to arouse the suspicion of the world's general public about the old society (capitalist society) and to strike at the imperialist powers; (2) Jointly attacking the Soviet Union and eliminating the socialist federation, this war, Japan in the East, Germany in the West (Hitler's Germany), and even Britain, France, and the United States, do not oppose it in principle. For the time being, they can ease their own conflicts, and Hitler uses this as an exchange condition for demanding equal armaments and restoring pre-war colonies; Japan uses this as a way to annex our Northeast and take advantage of this to seize Siberia and the coastal provinces, incorporating them into its own territory, which is indeed a good plan; (3) However, they are not fools. The current Soviet Union is at least not the Soviet Union of 1918-1922. The countries at that time did not benefit from entering politics. Now, to attack, at least prepare several times the previous strength and several times the previous sacrifices. Perhaps Hitler's Germany and Araki's Japan will be the vanguard in the future, but how will the result be, there is no guarantee. Although the German revolutionaries are temporarily oppressed by the violence of the Brownshirts, from the streets to the basements, if a war with the Soviet Union breaks out, they will come out of the basements again, run to the streets, pick up weapons, and disrupt Hitler's camp. Japan has just completed the conquest of China, but how to appease the opposition, how to develop industry, how to actively prepare, and how to cope with the situation in the Pacific, he does not dare to act rashly; (4) Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces and Jehol is naturally with the tacit consent of the great powers such as Britain, France, and Italy; France uses it to restrain Soviet Russia, Britain uses it to restrain his strong enemy the United States, Italy has very little relationship with the East, and has no real power to intervene externally, so it has to listen to it. The most threatened here are the United States and Soviet Russia: the Soviet Union is closing its doors to do its second five-year plan, trying its best to tolerate it, and although the United States knows it, if he wants to maintain the future of his capital, he can only interfere in Japan's monopoly of China with force, but if his military power does not cooperate with the Soviet Union or Britain, he will have no choice but to deal with Japan. Moreover, his own crisis is full of loopholes, "war is often the yeast of revolution," he knows this, and Britain and Japan also know this. Therefore, in this critical period, they are always trying to avoid armed conflict; (5) But although they are running around and shouting, trying their best to avoid conflict, on the one hand, it also proves that the explosiveness of their conflict is increasing extremely, and the poisonous beard of war has touched their consciousness. Therefore, their preparations for war are becoming more active and harder. Then, when everyone is at daggers drawn and the gunpowder is set, as long as someone pulls the fuse, like the blow of Archduke Ferdinand, it will immediately erupt; (6) When we assess the international situation, we must not forget the national movements in the colonies, such as the Sino-Japanese problem. After Japan's imperialists have realized the first step of their plan to invade the four northeastern provinces, of course they have to stop for a while to reorganize the land they have acquired. In China, they are only saying "if the enemy attacks, we will definitely resist". The implication, is it not exactly to the Japanese imperialists' liking? However, the main reason for the demise of the former Qing government was diplomatic failure, ceding land and seeking peace. Today's view of the past is exactly the same. China's national movement will never subside as they wishfully fantasize. China's national movement will definitely continue to develop, increasing the explosiveness and speed of world war. Therefore, in terms of the class position and fundamental interests of capitalist imperialists, attacking the Soviet Union is naturally more beneficial than fighting each other; however, whether their own conflicts of interest can be completely consistent is a question. The attitude of France and the small Entente countries he leads towards the so-called four-power cooperation shows this; that is, for the United States to attack the Soviet Union, based on his current interests, he gains very little, and naturally he is not very enthusiastic. No matter which aspect you look at this issue, I think it is a bit dangerous to draw a definite conclusion suddenly. At least I personally do not have this courage. As for Naijun's opinion that "the French feel the danger between their elbows, so they have to...conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. The so-called anti-Soviet front has disappeared," I am afraid it is also too optimistic. We should of course not forget "the conflict between imperialisms," that is, the internal contradictions of international capitalism, but at the same time, we must not forget the sharp conflict between the two major camps internationally. As for whether the recent international conflict will be an attack on the Soviet Union or a conflict between imperialists, it depends on how the aforementioned situation develops. This is this reporter's personal opinion, and I ask everyone to discuss it.</p>

Li spoke on "Rationalizing Chinese Education Research," stating that since China's self-government, internal and external troubles have been frequent, and the people's strength has been scattered and inconsistent. To save its ills, it depends on education. At the time of national crisis, it is especially important to find a way out from education. In the past, Chinese education lacked a center for collective research. Those who returned from studying abroad established their own schools, and there were various opinions. Some temporarily took advantage of the situation and advocated a theory. Some adopted one-sided knowledge, regardless of whether it was suitable for the national conditions or not. Once a theory was formed, it was implemented as it was. There were also those who echoed others and touted each other to become supporters. Today, they introduce various foreign new theories without digesting them themselves, and want to implement them in China. There are few who do not think that today is right and yesterday was wrong, and few have seen results. The object of education is the people, and the people are not material, so they cannot be randomly given medicine for testing. To study which foreign education is applicable to China, we must first find out the boundary between theories and non-theories in this trend, which is the product of a kind of spirit and interest, and which is the cultural requirement produced by a combination of a kind of theory and reality. Then, we should consider the national conditions and set a standard so that it will be beneficial and harmless. However, this matter is of great importance, and we must gather talents from all over the country to cooperate in research and establish a center for Chinese education research. All those who return from studying abroad, after researching a certain subject, should implement it slowly, and do not rush to introduce it. They must undergo in-depth research and believe that it is in line and applicable before implementing it. Its research methods, such as "academic aspects," establish lecture groups, publication groups, and subject research groups. Lectures are for propaganda education and to supplement the education of teachers. There are two types: long-term and temporary. Publications are divided into annual reports, magazines, series, etc. Currently, each province, county, and education group publishes a publication. It seems that having a publication is good for appearance, but it is not economical. And most people who receive this kind of publication do not read it. If there is a central research institution, the materials will be rich in research, and the content will be exciting. Once published, many people will compete to read it. The circulation will be wide, and the effect will be seen naturally. "Artistic aspects" establish necessary equipment for painting education, handicraft education, and music drama. "Physical education aspects," such as sports physiology, use theoretical research to prove national skills. There are also the essentials of youth training, the methods and equipment of physical education. "Painting aspects" equip educational films and educational phantom films. "Equipment aspects," such as instruments, specimens, reference books, etc. in each subject classroom equipment, list the standard items that must be equipped for each subject and display them in one room, so that outside visitors can refer to and imitate them. Also, such as school buildings, educators, hygienists, and architects should be invited to jointly study an appropriate standard school building plan and separately set prices for those who build new school buildings in various places to imitate. (Russia divides the construction of school buildings into several types, such as those that can accommodate 200, 500, 800, and even 2,000 people. They are all stipulated separately. How to build and how much it costs to handle the procedure. If there is a construction, they will follow the procedure separately.) In addition, there must be exhibits available for research. The exhibits are divided into permanent, temporary, and roving types for observation. In short, educators themselves must have a sense of responsibility and cultivate students to have a sense of responsibility, creating the shoulders of the country that can bear all the national difficulties of China, not only bearing the current responsibility, but also having the responsibility for the future.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Sends Personnel</p>
<p>To Beijing and Hangzhou to Negotiate Intelligence Tests</p>
<p>Since Director Pan took office in the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, he has devoted himself to the research of educational science.

This semester, it has decided to adopt the PORTEUS maze test scale to create a simple and easy-to-implement intelligence test scale to supplement the deficiencies of the Binet-Simon intelligence test scale.

This matter is directly related to the investigation of children'</p>

<p>Chen Shaokuan Speaks on</p>
<p>The Sale of Tianjin Medical School</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Naval Chief Chen Shaokuan stated that the Navy is paying close attention to the sale of the Tianjin Medical School by Zhang Xueliang. The school has a long history with the Navy, and it would be regrettable if it fell into foreign hands. It would be difficult to obtain such a large sum of money to establish a similar school due to the national treasury's deficit. Although the Navy, together with the Hebei Provincial Government and the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, has been negotiating with the French Concession in Tianjin for its return, it has been ineffective. Recently, the Tianjin French authorities forcibly dismantled the school's buildings, with talk of rebuilding them, making it impossible to recover the school. However, the Navy will follow the Executive Yuan's order to negotiate and hope for its return. (Special Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>British Parliament Discusses</p>
<p>China's Boxer Indemnity</p>
<p>Comparison of British and American Indemnity Refunds</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 1st: Baldwin made a statement in the House of Commons today regarding the Chinese Boxer Indemnity. Conservative Party member Miller stated that the British refund of the Boxer Indemnity is about five times greater than that refunded by the United States. The United States has a memorial in the form of Tsinghua University. Has Britain also had a similar memorial to represent the sacrifice of British taxpayers? Baldwin replied that Miller's comparison of the Boxer Indemnity refunds between Britain and the United States is incorrect. The United States refunded approximately $35,000,000 out of its total indemnity of $53,000,000, approximately 65.5%. As for Britain, its total indemnity was £16,500,000, and the amount refunded was £11,000,000, approximately 68%. The British refund is used to repair or build railways and other profitable enterprises in China and to establish a fund for future educational purposes. According to the Sino-British agreement and the bill passed by the British Parliament in 1931, the distribution of this fund is determined by the trustees. Although there is no memorial, the British government considers this to be the most practical way to benefit both countries. Conservative Party member Somerville asked if part of this fund would be transferred to the University of Hong Kong. Baldwin said he would answer this question later.</p>

<h3>The Opening of Summer</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The spring scenery is gone, but the national crisis has not gone, and it is advancing step by step with the god of summer! Mentioning the word "summer" evokes many feelings: China is called "Huaxia," but Huaxia has encountered bad luck and become a world of "barbarians corrupting China." Xia is the name of the first dynasty among the Three Dynasties. Thinking of Yu the Great's eight years of footprints establishing mountains and rivers, what a great achievement! Unexpectedly, the vast traces of Yu have become fragmented rivers and mountains! Also, Rehe, Luanyang, Beidaihe, and other places are all good places to spend the summer and escape the heat, but now they are unimaginable! Summer, oh summer, what are you here to do? With mixed feelings, I sing the opening of summer:</p>
<p>Ninety days of spring are gone and will not return, welcoming summer is also appropriate; The trivial thing is, being startled and experiencing scorching summer, let's talk about the word "summer" from the beginning: Anciently, Huaxia referred to China alone, Why is it that the barbarian's fortune prospers while Xia's declines? Only ending up with, barbarians corrupting China and entering the Yuguan pass! I remember, among the Three Dynasties of Shang and Zhou, there was Xia first, Yu the Great waded and established rivers and mountains: Today, who will recover the fragmented rivers and mountains? In the vast universe, enemies come again, We can only, cry mournfully on the tomb of King Xia! I also remember, the grand hall is called Xiawu, Helplessly, the swaying wind and rain have already collapsed; The swallows and sparrows in the hall are still not aware, Still, they go back and forth dancing in pavilions and singing on stages, How can they, in the backyard, forget to miss their homeland? Today, I fear reading the record of spending summer in Luanyang, Spending summer in Luanyang is always difficult; Beidaihe, suffers disasters, lamenting the ashes of the region for spending summer! Thinking of, finishing grieving for spring and regretting summer, old grudges and new sorrows cannot be dispelled, I can only, entrust the vastness of human affairs to the wine cup!</p>
<h3>The Expression of Human Nature</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>In the dance halls and gambling places of grand hotels, and in all social gatherings, regardless of men, women, old, or young, everyone has a golden expression, using snow-white silver dollars as if they were radish slices. In those places, the human instinct to love money is obscured. Some say that these things happen at night. Night is the time for humans to rest. Activity during rest time is fundamentally abnormal. An abnormal life naturally obscures human nature. If you want to see the expression of human nature, it is best to do so in the early morning. When you prop up your pillow and have had enough sleep, your mind is especially clear. That is the only time to reveal your true self.</p>
<p>These unanalyzed, and I don't know whether or not they align with philosophical, pedantic remarks have recently given me a very good impression. This is how it is. One morning, I went to the small vegetable market with my wife and children. By the green vegetable stall, I ran into a certain lady who I often see at the dog racing track but whose name I do not know. This certain lady buys tickets very ruthlessly, always spending twenty or thirty dollars at a time, and doesn't care about losing. But I saw her buying green vegetables, her face turned iron-green for the sake of a single coin, and she almost started a fight with the vegetable seller. In the end, the certain lady got a penny's worth of benefit, and as she left, she also grabbed a handful of free vegetables. This is the truest expression of human nature.</p>
<p>If readers are interested in sightseeing at the small vegetable market, they can certainly learn a very good lesson. In the small vegetable market, all kinds of disputes with bulging veins on the forehead, as thick as thumbs, are just over the difference of a single penny. This expression of human nature may seem somewhat undignified, but in fact, it makes a lot of sense. The big shots who give away sovereign territory to others are like the rich old men who only move around at night, seeing everything as relaxed and ordinary. Heroes who kill the enemy with great force are just like the sellers and buyers in the small vegetable market, showing a face that refuses to be taken advantage of everywhere.</p>
<h3>The Wonderful Use of Rings</h3>
<p>— Limin</p>
<p>We Chinese people have traditionally regarded rings as unnecessary decorations, without any implications. Later, after a generation of newly married couples who opposed the old moral teachings used rings as tokens of engagement, the ring became something with meaning. Because Princess Henry of England wore her wedding ring on the ring finger of her left hand when she married, it created a special custom, creating a worldwide habit. The following standards were discovered later:</p>
<p>The middle finger indicates the meaning of engagement.</p>
<p>The index finger indicates the meaning of proposing marriage.</p>
<p>The little finger indicates the ideal of celibacy.</p>
<p>Many women in the United States, in order to avoid the crush of marriage proposals, wear a wedding ring on their ring finger to reject the entanglements of men. Therefore, the sales of wedding rings in the United States each year amount to tens of millions.</p>
<p>The prostitutes in China use rings to indicate when they have their period, and they also use a ring to ward off clients from staying. This has the same meaning as marriage.</p>
<p>However, there are still many people who show off and do not know the meaning of rings, and often use them as decorations. This is too much of a letdown!</p>
<h3>Lamenting Spring</h3>
<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>People are shouting, "Spring has arrived!" Who knew that the "God of Spring" seemed ashamed to show its face, still not gracing us with its presence. You think, since the beginning of spring, the spring cold has been lingering, the spring rain has been continuous, and everyone is calling out that they are cold. The days with warm wind, gentle breeze, and bright spring sunshine are simply very, very few. Although I want to deliberately seek out spring, I still have a sense that "spring scenery doesn't know where to go." Now it is "flowing water, fallen flowers, spring has gone." In the blink of an eye, ninety days of good spring are about to bid farewell to people. But spring, when gone, will come again someday; I don't know when the lost magnificent mountains and rivers can be returned? Facing this slanting wind and fine rain, looking north at the clouds and mist, I can't help but feel "spirit broken in sadness"!</p>
<h3>Carrot Top's Whiskers</h3>
<p>— Written by IULES RENARD, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Whiskers found a mole on the road as black as a chimney sweep. After he had played with it enough, he decided to kill it. Several times he threw it into the sky, throwing it so skillfully that it landed precisely on a rock.</p>
<p>At first, the process went very well and was done very quickly.</p>
<p>The mole's legs were already broken, its skull had already been cracked open, and its back was also shattered. Its life didn't seem very sturdy. But then, Carrot Top's Whiskers saw that it wasn't completely dead, and this terrified him. Although he threw it very high, over the roof, into the sky, he could not find a way to kill it.</p>
<p>"This bastard! It's not dead yet," he cursed.</p>
<p>Indeed, on that blood-stained stone, the mole was a mangled mess; its fat belly trembled like congealed juice, and because of this trembling, it still seemed alive.</p>
<p>"It's awful!" Carrot Top's Whiskers became fanatical, he shouted: "It's not dead yet!"</p>
<p>He picked it up, cursing it, and changed his method.</p>
<p>His face flushed red with anger and tears welling up in his eyes, he spat on it, holding it very close, and threw it onto the stone with all his might. But that unsightly belly still trembled.</p>
<p>And, as Carrot Top's Whiskers frantically beat it even harder, the mole seemed even less dead.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Whiskers and his older brother Felix hurried home after finishing their prayers, because it was four o'clock in the afternoon, time for a snack.</p>
<p>Older brother Felix could get a piece of bread spread with butter or jam, while Carrot Top's Whiskers could only get a piece of dry bread. This was because he wanted to act like a grown-up early on, and had declared in front of many people that he was not greedy. He liked simple things and usually ate dry bread with a serious air. This afternoon he walked faster than older brother Felix, wanting to be the first to get the bread.</p>
<p>Sometimes dry bread seemed very difficult to swallow. So Carrot Top's Whiskers, like attacking an enemy, used all his strength to grab it, biting it desperately with his teeth, breaking it into pieces, causing crumbs to fly everywhere. The people in his family stood around, watching him with great curiosity.</p>
<p>His ostrich-like stomach could digest even stones or copper-green ancient coins.</p>
<p>In short, he ate things in the most casual way possible.</p>
<p>He pressed the bolt on the door. The door was already locked.</p>
<p>"I think Mom and Dad are not at home. You kick it," he said.</p>
<p>Older brother Felix, cursing, vigorously slammed the heavy door studded with many nails for a long time, making it creak. Then the two of them worked together again, hitting the door with all their strength, injuring their shoulders, but the door still did not open.</p>
<p>"They must not be at home," Carrot Top's Whiskers said.</p>
<p>"Then where did they go?" Older brother Felix asked angrily.</p>
<p>"No one can know everything. Let's just sit down for a while."</p>
<p>They sat on the cold steps, feeling a rare hunger. Sometimes yawning, sometimes pounding their chests with their fists, expressing their anger.</p>
<p>Felix: If they think I'll wait for them, they're wrong!</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Whiskers: But if we don't wait, what can we do?</p>
<p>Felix: I really won't wait for them. I don't want to starve. I want to eat right now, whatever it is. Even grass will do.</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Whiskers: Eat grass! That's a good idea, then they'll be fooled.</p>
<p>Felix: Hey! People eat lettuce "SALADE" and they eat it very well. For example, if we eat alfalfa, isn't it as tasty as lettuce? It's lettuce without oil and vinegar. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Silver Futures Rebound by $1.50</p>
<p>Long-Term Silver Prices Fail to Satisfy Expectations</p>
<p>Western Merchants Frenziedly Purchase Spot Goods, Leading to Scarcity</p>
<p>Smelting Costs Rise to Over $50</p>
<p>After a decline the day before, the gold market rebounded yesterday. Various rumors had little significant impact. The foreign exchange market performed poorly, with banks restricting transactions and many traders covering short positions due to the inflated currency in the US, which increased paper money supply and devalued gold. The US dollar in the local market should have weakened, but the gold market was affected by the US gold ban, leading to a perceived cash shortage and unfavorable swap rates. As a result, gold prices stabilized, further squeezing hedging opportunities. Market sentiment was stable today. Early morning reports of rising US bank rates had little impact, with initial gains quickly met by profit-taking due to hardened domestic bank rates. However, prices soon rebounded. Western merchant Xiang Meng, acting through Shen Kang, purchased over a thousand bars, further drying up the spot market and stabilizing sentiment. Although unconfirmed rumors circulated, their impact was limited due to the positive market atmosphere. Smelting costs were nominally quoted at an additional $40, but actual transactions occurred at an additional $55.75. A detailed account of the day's market conditions follows:</p>
<p>The market opened at $925.50, up $14 from the previous close. Spot goods opened at $27. The foreign exchange market opened tight. Near-term sell prices for British pounds were 1 shilling 3 pence 375, and US dollars were $24.875. Risen Gold Bar was listed at $9. Mitsui offered July US dollars at $25.375. Yuan Sheng Yong, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong Yuan Mao, and Yuan Chun also sold, leading to a downtrend. Pan Gen, North China, and MacGali blocked transactions. July fell from 4375 to $1. Da Xing Yong Fen also sold. Wah Bi covered August at 75, while Fu Chang Shun Li bought. It then rose to $4.50. Shortly after, Wah Bi blocked July at $1. Heng Xing and Yuan Xing Yong sold, breaking below $20. Citibank offered August US dollars at 8125, and July at 5625 and 625 in pairings. Heng Xing continued to offload, and Zhao Feng Chang also sold. HSBC announced its exchange rates, revealing British pounds flat and US dollars up 375, causing a drop to $15. Fu Chang Yuan Heng bought at lower prices, stabilizing the foreign exchange market and leading to a rebound. Zhi Feng Yong aggressively bought, rising above $20. July US dollars closed at 50 cents, and August at 75. Fu Chang and Hong Li both bought. Traders sought to close positions in US dollars. Bank selling appetite remained sluggish. Market sentiment was very stable. Shortly after, August US dollars at 6875 were difficult to close, rising to $25.50. Zheng Jin sold July US dollars to Citibank at 4375. Heng continued to sell, retreating to $2. In July, US dollars at 4375 in Shanghai were still popular. Yu, Qing Fa Shui, and Da Xing Yong all bought, rising above $30. At this point, rumors circulated that US cash could be exported. Xing aggressively bought, and Da Xing Yong also bought, surging to $33.50. MacGali blocked August dollars at 375. Fu Yu and Wan Xing both sold, gradually retreating. Mitsui offered July US dollars at 25, retreating to $26.50. Market sentiment remained stable. The midday close was $929, with spot goods bid at $9.50.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $930.30, with spot goods opening at $1. An Da and Wah Bi transacted July US dollars at 25. Zhi Feng Yong slightly bought, rising to $2.20. Fu Yu limited sales. Wah Bi offered July at 1875, while Heng Yu and Da De Cheng both sold, reaching $28. July US dollars suddenly became difficult to close. Zhao Feng Chang and Ri Chang both came to buy, causing a fluctuating rise, reaching as high as $23.70. Zhong Fu offered Zhejiang August US dollars at 375. Rui Xing sold, causing a decline. Fu Chang also sold, making the market smaller. However, transactions were extremely limited, leading to small fluctuations. As Pan Gen offered MacGali August US dollars at 50 cents, Zhi Feng Yong sold, retreating further to below $30, at $29.70. Yuan Sheng Yong and Yuan Mao Yong bought at lower prices, rising again to $32. Banks' appetite waned. Bombay telegraphed an increase of 3 annas, breaking the stagnant situation and causing a decline. Heng Xing entered the market to offload, reaching $30. At this point, fluctuations frequently occurred, and the market situation was calm for a long time. Wah Bi offered July US dollars at 1875, while Heng Yu sold at below $30. Finally, Yong Feng came to aggressively sell, gradually retreating to $27.40, and MacGali bought August US dollars at 50 cents. Yuan Mao Yong continued to buy, leading to a rise due to a dry market. Tong Tai Chang also bought. Retail investors aggressively pushed prices up to $33.50. Shortly after, the market closed at $933. Fu Yu bought after the close, and Hong Li also bought, so spot goods were bid at $3.50. Bing Xing sold, falling to below $3. The highest price for the day was $933.70, and the lowest was $915, with a fluctuation of $18.70. As a result, the closing price was up $21.50 from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>The published exchange rate from HSBC's US dollar listing was up 375, at $24.375. The gold price was $984.62, approximately $51.62 above the closing price, a decrease of $37 from the previous closing price. The registration for this month was $950, for June $929, morning supplement $954, afternoon supplement $958.</p>
<p>Smelting and swapping transactions were few due to an extreme lack of inventory and interrupted supply routes, resulting in a dull market. The morning opening estimate was an additional $40 to $50, with no supply available. A formal transaction was difficult to obtain within $50, making swapping unpopular. Since Qian Chang Xiang closed out over 9,000 May long positions the day before, they remained silent today, but swap rates looked low. Until the end, Rui Kang sold 490 taels to Ying Feng Heng, with smelting costs calculated at an additional $55.75. May trading was transacted by Heng Yu transferring 14 contracts to Da De Cheng at $955. May's contract total amounted to 3,696 contracts, with Qian Chang Xiang still holding over 3,000. Rumors say that all these long positions are handled by the board of directors.</p>
<p>Morning trading was more active, with fewer trades later in the day. Heng Xing, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao, Sheng Da, Yong Feng, Heng Yu, Rui Kang, Tong Yi, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Chun, etc., were mostly sellers. Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Hong Li, Fa Yong, Da Xing Yong, Shen Kang, Yuan Mao Yong, Ri Chang, Zhao Feng Chang, etc., were mostly buyers. Yuan Sheng Yong and Tong Tai Chang bought after initially selling. Rui Xing sold a small number. Dalian groups Shun Li and Wan Xing were mostly sellers. Guangdong group Heng Xing closed out over 600 contracts, while Sheng Ru entered approximately 100 contracts (through Tong Yi). Besides this, the trades were few and far between, as Kang once purchased over 1,100 contracts. The total number of June contracts amounted to 19,383, a decrease.</p>
<p>Hedging Tightens, Gold Merchants Aggressively Buy</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Both Tighten</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams, London's near-term spot interest rate was 625, with the long-term rate rising by 6875. The British pound to the US dollar was 2.75 points, and the US dollar to the British pound was 3.25 points. Market sentiment improved, so the opening price for the near-term British pound was 1 shilling 3 pence 375, tightening by 125 from the previous close. New York silver prices rose by half a point, but private telegrams only showed an increase of 125. Later, long-term silver prices only increased by 0.15%. The opening price for the US dollar was 24.875, tightening by 25 from the previous close. After the opening, banks restricted transactions, gradually tightening. HSBC's listed exchange rates showed British pounds flat and US dollars up 375. Later, gold merchants aggressively covered their positions, leading to an improvement. News was better and slightly tighter, but banks' appetites remained sluggish. The midday close was flat. The afternoon was extremely calm, with few transactions, only fluctuating around 125. Banks, apart from reciprocal transactions, still tended to restrict sales. Bombay telegraphed an increase of 3 annas, leading to a fluctuating situation. The closing price for the near-term British pound was 1 shilling 3 pence 3125, tightening by 1875 from the previous close. The US dollar was 24.6875, tightening by 4375 from the previous close. The British pound to the US dollar traded at 394.5 or lower in August. Pan Gen bought US dollars and sold British pounds (British-American exchange). Banks restricted transactions throughout the day, especially Wah Bi and Mitsui. Gold merchants aggressively bought, because hedging was tightening with long-term rates approximately $10 away, mainly due to the US gold ban. After the inflated currency, the US dollar depreciated, so gold merchants were able to profit. Today, they closed out 500,000-600,000 to cover their positions. Foreign firms also settled accounts. A record of the day's bank transactions follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening price for the near-term British pound was 1 shilling 3 pence 375. Mitsui sold July at 4375 to Mitsubishi. Mitsui covered August at 625. Wah Bi bought June at 50 cents.

<p>Silver Dollar Market Turns Idle Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market, with the end-of-April settlement completed, was quiet. The morning and afternoon interest rate for bank drafts was 6%, and the overdue interest rate was 13.4%, with no significant differences from normal. Banks received $5,340,000 in silver dollars and $5,890,000 in foreign currencies, with $600,000 deposited. Chinese banks received $1,000,000 in silver dollars, with $400,000 deposited.

Trading volume in small associations was over $500,000, remittances from various routes totaled over $500,000, and customer deposits were $800,000. Despite the current peak cocoon season, the large transaction volume this month has not been as high as in previous years due to crop failures.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges at the local clearing house on the 2nd was silver dollars totaling $6,514,290.88, including silver dollars totaling $4,219,182.31, remittances, silver dollars totaling $2,295,108.57.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Remains Chaotic</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars opened at $868 in the morning, up $7 from the previous afternoon, but the result was still flat.

Copper coins were reduced by 1,500, to 309,500. The transaction volume was over 38,000 strings.</p>
<p>Bond Market in the Past Two Days</p>
<p>Booming Transactions the Day Before Due to Positive Sentiment</p>
<p>Rumors Caused a Decline of Half a Dollar Yesterday</p>
<p>For the past two days, the Chinese Securities Exchange bond market was active. The day before, due to positive diplomatic sentiment, a total of $6,100,000 in transactions were made. Although not booming, June futures generally opened, and spot prices were strong. In one day, prices increased from 1-2 cents to 8.5 cents. However, with a weakening trend at the afternoon close, market sentiment was softer. Yesterday, due to Labor Day, newspapers were not published, causing limited news and the spread of rumors. Trading volume decreased significantly. Selling was more prevalent than buying. Prices mostly fluctuated with a weakening trend. News of tensions in Zhangjiakou and Miyun made people feel uneasy. There were also reports of changes in the situation in Eastern Luan, causing market participants to mostly observe. Only retail investors made some transactions. Throughout the day, the trend was weak in each session. However, because trading was extremely limited, the range was also very narrow. The amount of fluctuation was mostly 3 cents, with the minimum being 1-2 cents. The morning close was chaotic, with both highs and lows. Overall, throughout the day, prices fluctuated due to limited trading, and weakened due to unconfirmed rumors. As a result, prices generally fell, mostly by about half. Salt futures fell by 7 cents. The total transaction volume was approximately $3,995,000. There were no spot transactions. Futures salt tax had the highest volume, with only $1,040,000. Troop Reduction and Unified Tax each had over $700,000. The 20th series had slightly over $500,000, and the remaining had only tens of thousands to two to three hundred thousand. The market was dull, a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>New York Stocks Slightly Rise</p>
<p>According to New-Fong Yoko's report on Monday (May 1st), New York stocks initially surged due to the US dollar's sharp decline to below 8.5 cents. Later, profit-taking weakened the trend. The total transaction volume was 6,050,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price  Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 77.79 Up 0.13</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 33.46 Up 1.09</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 25.73 Up 0.64</p>
<p>40 Bonds 76.76 Up 0.20</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Remains Bearish</p>
<p>Despite Brisk Sales in Sichuan, It Can't Reverse the Downtrend</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, showing a flat trend again. Most market participants remain bearish. However, US cotton prices are soaring due to the passage of the currency inflation bill, rising aggressively, increasing by 75 points per pound over two days. Silver prices are still declining. Yesterday's market price rose by $1.78, but it has slightly declined today. The market remains erratic, requiring occasional purchases from Sichuan merchants. Prices rise after bidding, then frequently fall.</p>
<p>The opening market for human-made fiber rose due to consecutive increases in US cotton prices and good market sentiment the previous day, with prices for each month rising by 7-8 cents, reaching two or three sessions. Market sentiment softened, and prices for each month fell by 1-2-4 cents to $1.10. In the afternoon, some people believed that US cotton prices might decline, so there were more sellers, and prices for each month fell by 5-6-7 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,000 bales. Geng Feng sold 1,150 bales, Chang Feng sold 3,200 bales, and Yong Chang sold 1,100 bales. Xie Sheng bought 1,800 bales, Yi Chang bought 650 bales, Heng Yi bought 1,350 bales, and Sen Kang bought 1,250 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Total 213,600</p>
<p>Current Sales Reach Over 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. The total purchases by various merchants for the day are estimated at 1,070 bales. Prices rose by 5 cents in the morning and fell by 5 cents in the afternoon. Customer sales the previous day were 2,274 bales. The purchase amounts for each region are listed below:</p>
<p>Sichuan 595 Inland 45 Changsha 45 Industry 325</p>
<p>Guangdong 50 Fujian 5 Ningbo 5</p>
<p>The Number of Cotton Bulls Is Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, but the situation is slightly better than the yarn market. The number of new bulls is increasing daily because the US cotton inflation bill has been passed, and it is expected that US cotton prices may rise to 1 cent, so market sentiment is tighter. However, gold prices are declining, and calculating in silver reveals that prices are rising in name but falling in reality. However, in recent days, the ratio of exchange rates to commodity prices shows that US cotton prices are increasing to a greater extent, so the number of buyers is increasing. The future situation is uncertain.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Trends Downward</p>
<p>The Zheng Biao market opened higher due to consecutive increases in US cotton prices and strong gold prices, with each month increasing by 2-3 cents. Market sentiment loosened after two or three sessions, and each month trended downward, resulting in an increase of 1.5 cents. In the afternoon, each month fell by 1-2 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 66,600 dan. Sui Long sold 2,600 dan, Tong Fu sold 2,900 dan, Sen Kang sold 2,300 dan, Chang Feng sold 4,100 dan, Yong Chang sold 2,000 dan, and Da Chang sold 1,800 dan. Yu Kang bought 1,000 dan, Heng Yi bought 2,200 dan, Yuan Ren bought 2,500 dan, Ren Feng bought 1,900 dan, and Xie Sheng bought 1,900 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Cloudy Weather Causes Rice Prices to Rise by 2-3 Cents</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 sources, and the market was busy due to cloudy weather and limited sources. Sellers followed the trend and raised prices sharply. Su Tong japonica and South Port thick rice rose by 3-4 cents. Although rice bags were popular, customers seemed less enthusiastic, and bidding was strict. For example, Northern merchants, Weihaiwei, Qingdao, and Yantai merchants only bought 600-700 bags of Qingjiao and other thin rice. Southern merchants and Fuzhou merchants continued to buy over 1,000 bags of Song Si, West Lian, and other thin rice. Also, Su Tong and other rice prices rose sharply, causing prices to increase slightly. However, Qingdao special thin rice was accepted at zero profits, and prices were also clear. Du Yang pointed japonica was popular, and market prices increased by 2-3 cents. Chang merchants also increased prices for Yuan. Yin Yuan was scarce and had no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The previous day, few goods arrived from the river, and sales were good. White sugar increased by 1 cent, and Yuan showed signs of tightening. Yesterday, only 16-17 sources arrived from the river. White japonica had active sales in stores, and market prices increased by 2 cents. Thin sales were active, and continuous deliveries of rice were good. The price also increased by 1 cent. Sheep Du Bu became tighter, rising to near the Ruler's level. Yuan increased by several cents.</p>
<p>Flour and Wheat Have Slightly Tightened in the Past Two Days</p>
<p>The recent situation of flour is generally fluctuating steadily. A record of the past two days is written to clarify its trends. When the market opened on the first day, the prices of ocean wheat, both in Zhigan and elsewhere, rose by over 1 dollar each. But domestic buying power is weak, and the society is generally in an recession, so after the market opened, prices only rose by one or two cents, and there was no big rise. In the afternoon, because small factories gave their products at low prices, prices went back down by 1/10th to 1/100th of a dollar. The total volume of transactions in the whole city was only around 200,000 bags. When prices opened on the second day, the prices of ocean wheat went back down by 10-20 cents, and people were unsteady in their minds. But because factories did not want to sell, there was very little activity. However, the small traders did a bit of buying, so the atmosphere in the market seemed to be steady. This afternoon, prices did not decrease, but because there weren't a lot of people selling, and some people who were outside the market still wanted to buy, the price of futures went slightly higher. Overall, compared to the closing price last month, this month's price is higher by 7.5/1000 of a cent, June's price is higher by 1.5/100 of a cent, July's price is higher by 1.75/100 of a cent, August's price is higher by 1.25/100 of a cent, September's price is higher by 7.5/1000 of a cent, and October's market opened at 2 dollars, 4 cents, and 9.5/100 of a cent, which is less by 1.2/100 of a cent.</p>
<p>For the situation in wheat futures on days one and two, things were generally smooth. Though the prices of wheat in the ocean rose sharply in the market on day one, today's factories already have a lot of wheat on hand, and so they don't want to buy any wheat for the standards, so the market didn't go very high. When the market opened yesterday, wheat had already gone down by 10-20 cents, but there weren't a lot of people who wanted to get rid of their wheat, and both sides were observing, so there was very little trading, and prices were slightly tight. Judging from this kind of situation, it will only be possible to enter a bustling situation after a new stock comes out. As a result, July's price was 6/100 of a cent higher than last month's closing price, and August's and September's prices were 4/100 of a cent higher.</p>
<p>24 Cars of Wheat Were Delivered Last Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, all the Standard Wheat was delivered, and the delivery volume was high, to everyone's surprise. In the last few days, a lot of wheat has been imported from the ocean, and after the wheat merchants' wheat has been directly taken by the factories, the remainder was delivered to the exchange. The total amount delivered was 24 cars, with 26 delivering 11 cars, 8 delivering 3 cars, 16 delivering 7 cars, and 23 delivering 3 cars. Those receiving the wheat were 11 who received 4 cars, 5 who received 10 cars, 6 who received 3 cars, 24 who received 2 cars, and 38 who received 5 cars. It has been heard that 1 car of Standard Yellow was delivered.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil Prices Suddenly Fall by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Due to the sales of soybean oil weakening and the production prices also loosening, yesterday, Changyi took the lead in selling prices and offering 50 lots of Dalian oil, at a price of 15 dollars, 1 cent, which was more than half a yuan lower than the previous market price. Due to the increase in demand, the market slightly tightened, and there were also sales of 20 items of currently produced Dalian oil for 15 dollars, 3.5 cents. 1,000 items of Shahe Chuan Qi oil were sold for 14 dollars, 8 cents, so the market was also flat and tired. There was little trading of peanut oil, and 70 items of finished product were traded, at the originally offered prices. The market situation has temporarily settled.</p>
<p>Coarse Sand White Sugar Prices Rise by Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices slightly increased because the Dutch currency became slightly less valuable, and on top of that, the price of Sand White in the 24th Team had previously fallen to 20 dollars, and 2,800 packs were sold, so the atmosphere in the market was slightly uplifted. Yesterday, 300-400 packs sold for 20 dollars, 0.5 cents. In addition, 250 packs of transshipment goods were planned at 4 dollars, 1 cent per Dutch currency. The numbers for Medium Sand White in the 20th Team and Dutch Red in the 8th and 9th Teams were not settled. The manufacturer Zhenji offered the price for Grade 1 Cotton White at 19 dollars, 6 cents, less by 5 cents than the previous day. In addition, Guanghua offered a batch of Extremely Fine Sand White, at a price of 20 dollars, 4 cents. The red from Hainan from the household companies in Chaozhou sold for slightly higher prices. The price of sugar from Taikoo was slightly lower by 1 cent. The B Mark sold for 21 dollars, 9 cents, the CW Mark for 21 dollars, 7.5 cents, the DY Mark for 21 dollars, 6 cents, and the HX Mark for 21 dollars, 4.5 cents.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Markets Continue to Trade</p>
<p>Yesterday, international silk prices were stable, and the value of Shanghai's American currency was also low. 10 bolts of Twin Leopard (16.18) were sold for 830 dollars, and 30 bolts of Mimi Buddha (13.15)</p>
<h3>Chinese Park</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ziming</p>
<p>Although the Bund Park has trees, flowers, rockeries... its location along the riverbank makes it hazy and lacking elegance. It doesn't compare to the verdant forests and clear ponds of the Zhaofeng Park, where every part blends naturally. If one steps into the Chinese Park by the Suzhou Creek, one realizes it's not even up to par with the Bund Park. Compared to Zhaofeng Park, it's like a small witch in the presence of a great one.</p>
<p>The Chinese Park is indeed for the common people; no ticket is required for admission. Near the entrance is a restroom, reeking with a foul odor. The walls are plastered with advertisements for "curing spermatorrhea," "accurate psychic readings," "herbs for menstruation," and "treating syphilis".... a dazzling array, beautifully presented. Next to the restroom are food stalls selling cigarettes, peanuts, pancakes, fried dough sticks..., where rickshaw pullers gather to feast, relishing the flavors.</p>
<p>Now in springtime, the park's lawns remain barren, and the leaves on the trees are still withered, resembling a deep autumn plain. The open space is filled with many birdcages. Leisurely Suzhou residents, holding cigarette holders, enthusiastically pit their birds against each other. Songbirds are their second life. What state has the nation reached? How painful is it to be a conquered and enslaved people?... They will never think about it. It's truly a case of "No sorrow is greater than the death of the heart." Alas, what more can be said?</p>
<p>To the west of the park is a thatched pavilion. A young mistress reclines on a bench, singing whatever comes to mind: "A horse leaves the western Liang border..." A dirty-faced child jumps on the bench, laughing, smiling, and crying... The ground is covered in phlegm, peanut shells, and cigarette butts, an utter mess. Where is the Chinese people's sense of morality? No wonder foreign parks previously restricted Chinese people from entering.</p>
<p>The Chinese Park hardly deserves to be called a "park"; it's just a gathering place for hooligans and mistresses!</p>
<p>Qing Society Rehearsal Report: The Qing Society Opera Troupe rehearsed at the Lake Society yesterday. The program was filled with excellent performances, a feast for the eyes. The highlight was undoubtedly "Kneeling by the Pond," where the three actors collaborated seamlessly from beginning to end. The tightness of their coordination and the realism of their expressions were truly remarkable, a rare feat among opera enthusiasts. Next was "Parting from Mother to Return to Camp," which was both energetic and poignantly tragic, and "Portraying an Experienced Hand," which showcased amazing skill and charm, deserving of special recognition. "Jiao Cu Drunk Yuan" was a masterpiece by a famous artist, truly extraordinary, with the bursts of laughter being particularly unique. "Night Lesson Dream" juxtaposed sorrow and joy perfectly, while "Flirting with the Qin and Stealing Poetry" was delicate, touching, and moving. "Small Banquet at Broken Bridge" was skillfully coordinated, a perfect combination. "Visiting the Broadsword Society" was powerful and grand, a rare achievement. "Longing for the Mortal World" and "Auspicious Day" were light and fluid, while "Debating Swords and Sending a Son" was generous and stirring, each displaying its own strengths. "Looking in the Mirror and Feeding Horses" was extremely comical, bringing everyone to laughter. With such excellent productions, it's no wonder opera lovers watch day and night, with doubled enthusiasm. (Wang Qi)</p>
<p>Social Sketches</p>
<h3>Comedy</h3>
<p>— Lin Zichun</p>
<p>In order to visit a friend in H City to discuss some matters, I had to take another Yangtze River steamer.</p>
<p>In the cabin across from mine, there was a modern and fit young woman. Perhaps because there were few passengers, she, like me, occupied a cabin alone. Her door was often open, and those passing by could see clearly that she was always lying in bed reading. Except for the "toilet" issue, she rarely left her room, even eating her meals inside.</p>
<p>A young man in a suit, I don't know if he was a passenger, lingered most enthusiastically at her cabin door, constantly humming the song that Macdonald and Jeanette MacDonald sang in the movie "The Merry Widow." His walking and whistling were quite impressive, causing other passengers to shake their heads in admiration.</p>
<p>The next day, after dinner, I felt bored and went to the ship's purser's office to chat with the staff. We were acquainted, so the conversation was relaxed. We had been talking for a while when the modern young woman suddenly came into the purser's office.</p>
<p>"Are you the purser?" she asked politely.</p>
<p>"Yes, Madam. Is there anything we can assist you with?" the staff replied. "It's outrageous! There is a young man in a suit who is always walking back and forth in front of my cabin door and winking at me! I ignored him. Originally, I left my cabin door open because the air in the room was not very good. To avoid this man, I had to close the door. Unexpectedly, he then looked through the window. Tonight, he even wrote this note to me. Take a look." As she spoke, she handed a note written in pencil to a Mr. X on the staff.</p>
<p>"...You are an angel from heaven, and I admire you immensely. But you always ignore me! ...I feel there is nothing left for me in this world! I have decided to drown myself tonight at X hour. ...The luggage I leave behind in cabin X, please kindly deliver to my family. I am eternally grateful..."</p>
<p>X.X. Sincerely</p>
<p>(Date)</p>
<p>The handwriting on the note was not good, and there were a few typos! The above is what I wrote based on his meaning.</p>
<p>"Ah... a joke, a joke! Does one have to send out invitations before committing suicide? He seems to be saying, (Respectfully request your presence at the suicide of X.X. on X month X day at X hour.) What a joke, a strange story! Madam, please go back to sleep peacefully. Don't be afraid, we'll take care of everything," a member of the staff said, reassuring her after reading the note.</p>
<p>"Hey... the time has come, go ask him," Mr. X said to the tea servers. Immediately, several tea servers stepped forward and grabbed the young man. Then I and the staff also stepped forward.</p>
<p>"Sir... are you a guest in cabin X?... You are young and have a bright future... Why do you want to commit suicide?... Our country is facing such great difficulties! Isn't sacrificing yourself for the country more honorable than this meaningless suicide?" the staff members said noisily to the young man.</p>
<p>"I am not committing suicide, why are you grabbing me?... " The young man seemed to realize that his ruse had been exposed, and his speech was somewhat unnatural. "Didn't you tell the female guest in cabin X that you were going to drown yourself? And... here is the note you gave to that female guest," the staff countered.</p>
<p>The noisy commotion alarmed many passengers, who came running out to see what was happening. The young woman was also among them, and pointed at the young man, saying, "It's him. Is this person crazy?" A middle-aged guest in his thirties said.</p>
<p>"No... perhaps a drowned ghost has possessed him? Quickly, slap him on the face a few times, and you can scare away the drowned ghost," an old woman among the passengers said.</p>
<p>The young man tried to break free from the tea servers' grip and explain that he was not committing suicide... A tea server had already slapped him on the face several times before releasing him from the crowd, with a "reddened" face.</p>
<p>This comedy ended with everyone "Hahaha..." as if they were very satisfied with the show.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of Northeast China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Brewing Tea Through the Long Night, Lamenting the Passing Year, Inscribing Slogans Against Brutality, High-Pitched Shouts on the Day of Resistance</p>
<p>The three students, about twenty years old, were all as if drunk, their faces flushed red. The wind and sand blowing in their faces added a layer of deep gray on top of the red. Following this large slogan was a group of over a thousand male and female students, all carrying tense and tragic faces under a small white paper flag. The student in front holding a megaphone directed the megaphone towards the Orient of the three Fu Sang islands and shouted: Expel the generals who do not resist! Down with Japanese imperialism! Then thousands of people behind them opened their mouths wide against the wind, following the slogan and shouting. Especially the female students let out sharp voices, drawing out the last word extremely long, causing one to feel an indescribable feeling upon hearing it. Yin Deren said: Damn it, this non-resistance again? Why don't they resist? Zhao Ziqiang, a prudent person, quickly pulled him aside, turning his face away. Tian Qing also whispered: Luckily they are in chaos and didn't hear it, otherwise it would be a disaster. Yin Deren said: What are you afraid of? Since they are patriotic people, they know how to reason, I want to reason with them. The three were arguing like this when they heard a quiet voice behind them calling out: What are you three talking about here? Zhao Ziqiang turned around and saw a female student. He saw she was wearing a blue cloth jacket, and her arms were exposed, frozen like purple grapes. The black silk skirt below was worn short, revealing a large section of dark green woolen socks on her thighs. Below was a pair of short and round black canvas shoes. Her short hair on her head was blown by the wind, scattered like a ball of thatch. Only her handsome oval face, although covered in wind and sand, could not hide its watery beauty. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: Oh! Miss Huang Man, you've saved us brothers a lot of trouble. Tian Qing looked at her, realizing it was his lover, and smiled: Yo! Such a cold day, wearing so little clothing, aren't you afraid of the cold? As he spoke, he saw a section of scarf dragging down from her shoulder, so he helped her up and wrapped it around her neck. Yin Deren said: Second Brother, look at Xiao Tian, what kind of energy is that. Zhao Ziqiang poked his arm with his hand and glanced at him, saying: You are really a fierce Zhang Fei, how can you say such things? Huang Man also glanced at Yin Deren and said with a smile: Company Commander Yin speaks in such a loud voice. (59)</p>

<h3>"Claiming to be Nanyang Ge, People Remember Qin Hui"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Recently, someone in Beiping wrote a humorous poem: "Claiming to be Nanyang Ge, People Remember Qin Hui." One sentence exposes the secret in the hearts of some people today!</p>
<p>"Zhuge's great name is known throughout the universe," isn't this the best thing in the world? Unfortunately, "great name" is not the same as garbage, which can be picked up everywhere. When Zhuge Liang descended from Wolong Ridge, it was when Liu Bei was destined to decline. Given Liu Bei's past friendship with Cao Cao, Zhuge Liang could have done a favor and advised Liu Bei to surrender to Cao Cao, securing a lifetime of wealth. But Zhuge did not do this. He had to personally seek help from General Sun and fight Cao Cao to the death. Liu Bei was defeated at Guoting, and "died midway" in Baidicheng. According to the principle of "internal stability before external resistance," Zhuge Liang should have first fought Sun Wu to the death before embarking on his six expeditions to Qishan. But Zhuge, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of guardianship, first reconciled with Sun Wu, determined that "Han and the rebel cannot coexist," and that "six expeditions to Qishan" were necessary. With Zhuge Liang's reputation and status, if he had secretly reconciled with Sima Yi, why wouldn't he have "wealth forced upon him"? But he "exhausted his efforts" until his death in Wuzhangyuan, still insisting that "Han and the rebel cannot coexist," and ordered Jiang Wei to carry on his legacy. Such a great name, known throughout the universe, was obtained with too much hardship. Are there any such Zhuge Liang today?</p>
<p>In front of Yue Fei's tomb, there is a couplet by a certain lady, the second line being "White iron innocently cast treacherous officials." Qin Hui probably didn't care about such posthumous matters. At the time, Hui wanted to obtain the position of Prime Minister, declaring, "I have two strategies that can stir the world." After he became Prime Minister, he indeed presented two strategies: "Returning the people of Hebei to Jin, returning the people of the Central Plains to Liu Yu." He decided on the grand plan of peace talks, telling Gaozong, "Officials are fearful and hesitant, mostly holding two opinions. This is not enough to discuss major matters. If Your Majesty is determined to make peace, please discuss it exclusively with me and do not allow the officials to participate." When the officials opposed the peace talks, Hui angrily said, "Hui only desires to benefit the country!" So direct and straightforward, wanting peace, then peace. No matter how you laugh or scold, he wouldn't care. He killed Yue Fei, and after his death, knelt in front of Yue Fei's tomb, allowing thousands of people to defile him. He was perfectly willing. I wonder if anyone is learning from Qin Hui today?</p>
<p>The poem says: "Shouldering the universe with one pole, it's easy to lift but hard to put down. I advise you to hold it high with a sky-supporting hand, many bystanders watch with cold eyes!" I would like to recite this poem again!</p>
<h3>Visiting the Sick</h3>
<p>— Qiu Peng</p>
<p>Pushing open the door, the gatekeeper's gloomy face emerged from beside the gate bar.</p>
<p>"?"</p>
<p>"Ward 420?"</p>
<p>"Upstairs," the gatekeeper raised a hand and casually waved it to the left, showing not only indifference but also some weariness.</p>
<p>I followed the direction he waved me in, my feet so heavy, dragging step by step! Turning the corner, I saw the white terrazzo staircase winding like a snake ahead. On both sides were white walls and white curtains; a nurse in white slowly pushed a two-wheeled cart, which contained a patient covered in a white sheet, a deathly white face... I followed the staircase, countless white circles flashing before my eyes, an eerie, underworld-like feeling invading my heart, I drifted like a ghost!</p>
<p>"NO 420" Suddenly this number clearly jumped before my eyes, so I gently knocked on the door with this number nailed on it. A middle-aged woman with swollen eyes opened the door for me, letting me in before gently closing it again. Dragging behind the woman was a skinny child of about five or six years old, who was staring at me with wide eyes. On the hospital bed by the window, Mr. XX lay still like a corpse, his deeply sunken eyes slightly closed, a few sparse, pale hairs scattered like withered grass on his dry head... As I approached his bedside, he opened his absent eyes and stared at me for a while before extending a withered hand and beckoning me to sit on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>"Feeling better?" I began awkwardly with condolences:</p>
<p>"It's just a matter of time, there's no hope of survival."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" My tone of surprise was overly strong.</p>
<p>"Tuberculosis! The doctor said the disease is entirely due to long-term overwork without adequate rest, especially since it shouldn't have been delayed until half of the lung has been eroded by mold! It's all too late... This, how could I not know? But XX, you tell me, in an environment like mine, is there an opportunity for me to rest? Every time I endure the hidden pain in my chest and work, I think, isn't this accelerating the destruction of my remaining life? So, let go! But I can't ignore my wife and children's food and clothing! Struggling like this until today, who knew it would finally be this..."</p>
<p>He choked up and turned his face away, two tears streaming from his deeply sunken eyes.</p>
<p>A heavy sorrow pressed down on my heart; I sat silently.</p>
<p>"Actually, 'death' seems as ordinary to me as sleeping. What is there to be nostalgic about in a life like mine? The suffering is for those two, the mother and child. How will they be in the future..."</p>
<p>He stopped his tears and raised his dim eyes to look at his wife, who was burying her face in her handkerchief, sobbing; the child looked at his dad, then at his mom, and suddenly grabbed his mom's sleeve and burst into tears.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and turned his face away again!</p>
<p>"Another result of long-term labor exploitation!" I suddenly closed my eyes as well.</p>
<h3>American Family Life</h3>
<p>— Qian Gechuan</p>
<p>When material civilization reaches a certain level, the structure of society will also change. Whether the family can continue to exist forever will become a problem. Modern American family life shows us just such a meaning. Because of the development of machinery in America, individuals have extra time, and because of complete equipment, household labor is almost unnecessary, coupled with the bankruptcy of chastity, male-female relationships have no guarantee to speak of. So although there is the form of a family, there is no reality of a family. This kind of family that is insecure from morning to evening is really worthy of sociologists to study. The form of human life is originally the factor that determines social organization, and modern mechanical life has launched a great revolution against the basic family of human life. Modern Americans, benefiting from mechanical civilization, have almost only one-tenth of the work left in the home compared to the past. Everything needed in the family does not require manual labor to obtain. Water can be brought by tap water pipes, fire can be supplied by gas and electricity, and boiling water is boiling in the basement from morning to night. The housewife only needs to use her slender hands to turn the faucet, and then there is water, there is fire. Sitting at home without moving, it is not only possible to have boiling water, but it is also easy to have ice in hot weather. Because there is a kind of electric ice maker, you only need to put cold water in it, and it can turn into ice. With gas and electricity, boiling water and cold ice are all available. As you can see, it is not very laborious to cook. However, those living a family life in America are unwilling to do even this little bit of trouble. When they are hungry, they gently pick up the phone and make a call, and in less than a quarter of an hour, a sumptuous banquet is displayed in front of them. The only place of happiness is no longer the family in modern America. They are really at home too little. Except for breakfast, ordinary families eat out.</p>
<p>Modern American buildings have doors and windows that can fit together perfectly, with no gaps, and dust from the outside is not easy to enter. Moreover, they have a kind of vacuum cleaner, which sucks up all the dust and debris when pushed around the room. The beds are installed in wall cabinets, turned to the middle of the room at night, and then put away in the morning.</p>
<p>The thing that can best maintain a family is children, but modern American women are mostly unwilling to give birth to children. Even if they have them, infants can be sent to hospitals, and when they grow up a little, they can still be entrusted to nurses or specially hired nannies to take care of them. Mothers without money have to come out to work during the day, and children are also sent to day care centers for foster care. (After the children reach adulthood, they treat their parents like strangers.)</p>
<p>Even housewives are like this in the family, not to mention men. The place where the family has a relationship with them is only sleeping at night and receiving letters in the morning. So they don't need an independent family, and many people use apartments or hotels as permanent residences. Because there, even the equipment in the family and the trouble of turning on the faucet are unnecessary. Since the family is already unnecessary and no one needs to be taken care of, of course both men and women have the extra energy to develop outwards. Modern American women can enter the Presidential Palace as cabinet members and go abroad as ambassadors. Women who only talk about sitting at home as housewives, like Chinese women, are of course very few. Men and women have to go out to work during the day and cannot stay together all day long, so the so-called family reunion happiness is naturally greatly reduced. Since women do not rely on men economically, they can be free. They are now unwilling to continue to abide by the kind of chastity that only forced women to abide by in the past. What is divorce? A woman does not become unmarriageable because of one divorce. Moreover, after a divorce, men usually have to pay alimony, so women always get the advantage, so most divorces in America are initiated by women. Today, it seems that there is one divorce out of every five marriages in America. Today, let's browse American literary news THE (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Visits Gandhi</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>My goodness! Ships and trains really do run too fast. The buzzing of Comrade Zhang's "resignation" and "going abroad" is still fresh in our ears, but now, in the blink of an eye, he has arrived in Bombay, India. It is said that when Tang Sanzang went to the Western Paradise to obtain scriptures, even though he rode a white horse that was the embodiment of a divine dragon, it still took him many years, and he might not even have been to Bombay. So, scientific inventions are truly too convenient for people like our Comrade Zhang to "resign" and "go abroad," or to go abroad for recuperation. This is something we ordinary people wouldn't even dare to dream of.</p>
<p>Comrade Zhang Xueliang's trip abroad has really been a breath of fresh air, and he has even resolved to give up his habits. Some people say that this is because European and American countries have not implemented "opium monopolies," which would be very inconvenient. But in reality, he wants to sincerely be a model Chinese person to win honor for China. Precisely for this reason, of course, he must also promote non-resistance to the fullest extent, to "correct international perception." So, in Bombay, he decided to visit his teacher, Gandhi. Unfortunately, he was not granted permission by the government and had to abandon the idea.</p>
<p>However, we can fully believe that Comrade Zhang will "continue to work hard to implement" this great doctrine. His teacher, the sage Gandhi, will certainly do the same. Although one is in the wilderness, one is in prison, one is a citizen of a subjugated nation, and one is a promising general of a nation on the verge of subjugation, their endeavors are all successful. The facts are before our eyes. In recent years, many toiling masses in India have gloriously sacrificed themselves for this great doctrine, and China's achievements are even more remarkable, astounding foreigners. If the British government were to "permit" him to meet Gandhi, reaching out their hands through iron bars, then one would call out "Brother," and the other would call out "Worthy Brother," and everyone would smile knowingly, all understanding each other without words. The most regrettable thing is that the British government will certainly not allow him to visit. Otherwise, if the teacher and disciple could meet, and from then on work even harder, the doctrine would become popular, and all the weak and small nations of the world would, under the command of non-resistance, allow imperialism to conquer them with peace of mind. And these two teachers and disciples would thus enjoy high official positions and salaries, and enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Another point is that our Comrade Zhang's leisure and elegance at this moment are also most obvious. The reason is that Bombay is so far away from Nanjing, and Nanjing is also far away from the outside of the Great Wall. Of course, the sounds of imperialist cannons cannot be heard. Even if they immediately attack Tianjin and Beiping, it would not necessarily be detrimental to our comrades. Therefore, we can confidently predict that the doctrine of non-resistance will surely be passed down from generation to generation. However, Gandhi's non-resistance and Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance are actually somewhat different.</p>
<p>Female Students in Shanghai, Relief for Geng</p>
<p>"Female Student" | These three words are quite attention-grabbing! | A silhouette of a thoroughly modern woman vaguely emerges, like a vision before my eyes.</p>
<p>In Shanghai | No matter what kind of group is organized, or what kind of newspaper is launched, female students participate; there are accounts of female students' actions and their beautiful faces. They are like licorice root in medicine, without their adornment, there is not much excitement, and everything feels dull and tasteless!</p>
<p>Female students are not only beautiful, but their clothing is even more novel and full of curves, showing off their full breasts, fleshy arms, and round legs as much as possible. They are also very lively, intelligent, understand social psychology, understand human affairs, and cater to the psychology of those foul men. If you gaze at them, they will respond with a smile, understanding your intentions. If you chase after them, they will turn around and give you a charming smile, indicating that they understand your feelings. "Female students" are truly delightful!</p>
<p>In school! The scenes swirling in the minds of female students are all about: writing love letters, dating lovers, watching movies, strolling in parks, going dancing, going to hotels... etc. Reading books can be done carelessly, but | anything related to the pursuit of beauty: hairstyles, eyebrow drawing, applying rouge, dyeing nails... etc., these studies must be mastered perfectly, and must not be relaxed at all. "Reading books"! What a waste of time. Anyway, if you fail the exam, just give a captivating glance, act coquettish, cry, and you'll surely soften their hearts, leaving them with no choice but to grant your wishes, watching helplessly as you sing the graduation song from your scarlet cherry lips |</p>
<p>Female students in Shanghai are truly delightful! There are many prostitutes in amusement parks who even use the guise of "female students" to flaunt their charms and seduce men.</p>
<p>Here! It can be seen how powerful the magic of female students is in Shanghai!!!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This so-called "Female Students in Shanghai" does not mean that most female students in Shanghai are like this; only a minority of female students are like this. Therefore, the majority of female students are implicated by the minority of female students. This must be explained here.</p>

<h3>Recent Work on Feeling Presented to Qiaomin</h3>

<p>Everywhere, wind and clouds hold sorrow, sitting and listening to the sound of the bugle late in the evening. The great treasure is secretly moved, and I guide myself, the old nest is shaken and falls, and the sun rushes westward. The myriad regions are in distress, and I empty my tears, the eight directions are all dark, and I lose my foothold in danger. Liaohai has already lost 30,000 li, and dust flies over the five mountains, with abundant grief.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Morning Talk</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>Flower Market</p>
<p>Shanghai | A dark hell. Raising your head, you can't see what the sky looks like; if you happen to look out from the window of a small building, you only see a gray-white corner, broken by tall buildings; you can't see flowers, you can't see trees. I know that the dog sign that says "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed" has already been removed, and I've also seen foreign children throwing balls outside the iron fence. But on our own land, there still stands a black-toothed foreigner. The price of a silver dollar can be squandered in five minutes at a dance hall; but in the pockets of the poor, they are reluctant to put that money into the rice shop's till even after a whole month; I finally looked at the place where foreign children throw balls inside and outside the iron fence, and tightly grasped that snow-white silver dollar to return. For the sake of my job, I often step into magnificent guest rooms, where small, exquisite vases on the desk are filled with fresh flowers of all seasons, which makes me wonder if the flowers in Shanghai are mysterious monsters. But since I can't afford the few yuan per month to obtain them, I'm too embarrassed to ask people where my beloved flowers come from. This question was solved in a high-priced night of sleeplessness.</p>
<p>Coming out of the newspaper office, a group of people wandered towards Xiao Wang's house. Stepping out of the iron gate of Nanyang, the fragrance that refreshes the heart and spleen welcomes my nostrils in the breeze, it is the fragrance of flowers. The doors of the Wanhua Building | Small Teahouse | are filled with various kinds of flowers, and when they enter my eyes, I jump up like a child. Inside the Wanhua Building, there are even more expensive flower exhibitions. I did not solicit the opinions of my companions. I stepped into the Wanhua Building from the crowd, and the tea shop boy stopped me, saying: "Sir, I'm sorry, the flower market does not sell tea to guests." I stood there without saying a word, not knowing how to answer him. Xiao Wu and the others had already squeezed up and smiled, saying: "Can we borrow a stool and sit outside the door? We really like flowers." The flower shop boy readily gave us a stool. The flower market extends from Nanyang Bridge to the intersection of Lafayette Road. Middle-aged men with their trouser legs rolled up to their thighs, old women with curved backs, and young women on Nanjing Road shouting "Do you want white orchid?" are all discussing prices for their harvests, preparing to sell them to the people of the city for decorations on their desks after dawn.</p>
<p>Looking at these many flowers that have not yet bloomed, I feel sorry for them. You are sent to Shanghai from the distant countryside, only to be offered on the desk for one day. The second time it dawns, you have already been discarded into the trash can. Your life is so short!</p>
<p>I even imagine the courtyard of my hometown, in which there are dozens of pots of Schlumbergera that I planted myself. Since I drifted to Shanghai, have your destinies suffered the same encounters as mine? Returning to the small building, a paper flower on the desk nods frequently to me. Since I moved into the small building, it has always maintained its due freshness. Because I don't have fresh flowers, I especially protect it, and it still smiles enchantingly at people! Flowers, this is your destiny. You treat people with a pure heart, but inevitably you are grabbed and thrown into the trash can; those painted red and green, on the other hand, can survive in this world!</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Geishas</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>One. Prologue</p>
<p>Since I am a person who makes a living by writing, most of my time is spent between the tip of the pen and the ink dots. But I cannot help but be scolded as a "literary beggar," almost bordering on shamelessness. Originally, such ridicule is indeed very embarrassing, and several times I was simply so angry that my face turned red and my ears turned red, and I showed my anger on my face, and even wanted to use all my strength to spit at him, and then wrestle with him once, but after calmly thinking about it, I am in fact already like this. I cannot immediately put down my pen and immediately become a gentleman, not to mention that I have never hung up the sign of ARTFORART, so soon, I will be able to take it calmly. Now I write and perhaps I will have to write again later.</p>
<p>But writing articles is not easy. At least in terms of structure, it is difficult to find a subject that I think is satisfactory. I think anyone who can write probably feels the same way. Then now I have to thank my neighbor.</p>
<p>This man's surname is Wu, and his given name is Gui. It is originally a very remarkable name, and just in terms of the word Gui, he himself should be developed a bit, but sometimes when you shout his name and surname quickly, it is inevitable that it is not very elegant to hear. However, he is always called that way by people intentionally or unintentionally, and although some children cannot help but laugh, he does not care. From this, it can be seen that his magnanimity is indeed very great.</p>
<p>Then, my acquaintance with him is of course because he is my neighbor, as mentioned above, and I can often see him, but he also has such an interesting name, so I am unconsciously more aware of him.</p>
<p>It was a hot evening. Because the weather was too hot, the little pug was still panting with its tongue out. At this time, the wife and the teacher's wife were mostly playing cards or listening to the radio broadcast on the balcony; the nanny and the ama were fanning themselves with palm fans next to the car in the alley. At that time, Wu Gui was also sitting on a small stool, sandwiched between the women, chatting and laughing, looking very leisurely.</p>
<p>When I walked up to him in slippers, he quickly and politely got up to give me a seat. He is always so polite, and always calls me "Master" and "Master." Although I always feel that I don't have that kind of status, but since he has to do it this way, I will just let him call me that way, anyway, in this world, it is inevitable that everyone is polite to each other.</p>
<h3>He Who Receives the Country</h3>
<p>— Shi Nong</p>
<p>"Sir, now that Rehe has fallen and North China is in danger, please donate some money to buy planes to resist foreign aggression. Sir, we are both Chinese, and I think you must be very generous," said the person soliciting donations for airplanes to save the country sincerely.</p>
<p>That gentleman was indeed a little moved, and reached into his pocket to take out a ten-yuan bill and waved it at the solicitor. The solicitor smiled and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, you are truly a patriot!"</p>
<p>But the gentleman hesitated and put his hand holding the bill back in. He thought:</p>
<p>"It's too uneconomical to donate ten yuan to someone else. This ten yuan can buy a beautiful dress for my lover..." Those charming eyes and smiling face flashed before his eyes.</p>
<p>He reached into his pocket and exchanged it for a five-yuan bill.</p>
<p>"Take it," he thought. But then he thought again, five yuan can buy a rich meal... Miss Wang's watch hasn't been bought yet? ..."</p>
<p>So, suddenly, his hand reached back into his pocket from the outside.</p>
<p>"Hey! Sir..." the solicitor became impatient.</p>
<p>This time, the gentleman really took out a shiny Yuan head and handed it to the solicitor.</p>
<p>"Okay... the volunteers of modern Northeast thank you, sir!" The solicitor took the money and left.</p>
<p>The gentleman stood on the road in a daze, thinking randomly:</p>
<p>"One yuan can buy the foreign dolls and cookies that the children want... why not give him a few cents?</p>
<p>Alas! It's too wasteful."</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you give less money to the rickshaw puller, because what is not there will always be not there... it doesn't matter how much you give more, why bother?</p>
<p>When visiting prostitutes, when you meet the girls, it's like Han Xin commanding soldiers, the more the better; first, it shows how extravagant your carriage is, and second, it shows how extravagant your carriage is... (I can't find a word to describe it when I put down my pen, so I'll replace it with... for now, I'm very sorry).</p>
<p>The residue of herbal medicine is scattered on the street, the smell is fragrant, and passers-by cover their noses and pass by; if it were not so, how could the great spirit of our weak literary country be shown?</p>
<p>Alas, hygiene! Hygiene, alas! (Alas, is an exclamation of death; hygiene alas means hygiene is dead.)</p>

<p>It is absolutely impossible to donate unusable money to the Northeast Righteous Army. It is more proper to spend money on prostitutes, opium, mahjong, kissing, and movies.</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo said: "All lazy and gluttonous humans will eventually perish. Korea's subjugation to Japan, India's subjugation to England, and the division of Australia are all due to the gluttony and laziness of their people. I once met a Japanese count in Korea. That count said to me: 'Korea will soon perish!' I asked him how he knew. He said, 'Look, everyone in Korea likes to eat beef.' Soon Korea did perish."</p>
<p>A woman who advocates celibacy is telling you that she doesn't have a lover yet.</p>
<p>I heard that Gu Weijun's family has a dog that went abroad with its master more than ten years ago, but now it still barks madly at strangers in its old home. I think this dog's luck is not very good! Those who have gone overseas cannot teach in the Imperial Academy, but they can also get a job as a doorman at the university gate and eat bread, and the school can also boast: Our school's gatekeeper is a "study abroad dog"!</p>
<p>Lying at home reading novels, most of them are about love; walking on the street, I see couples coming and going, "love sickness" is lingering, and "poverty sickness" is even more severe, it is pathetic! But thinking back to these chaotic years, I hum a song I saw somewhere: "How many people have been killed in the world, it is good to keep your head even if you are poor!"</p>
<p>Store Clerk Communication</p>
<p>Beast Soldier</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am an ignorant and naive person. I am only twenty-one years old this year. I was married by my parents when I was nineteen years old. We both have very good feelings. I only came to Shanghai in early April this year. I was introduced to study medicine at a certain hospital. Recently, I received a letter from home telling me that there was a military disaster there, and my wife was raped by soldiers. According to my parents' wishes, they want her to go out freely, because this is related to the face of our family. The letter is asking for my opinion: But when I think of how good her love for me was in the past, she has never blushed once in the past two years. If I want to keep her, my parents will not allow it; if I don't keep her, my heart really can't bear it. This makes me feel conflicted. I hope you can teach me something, it is my sincere prayer. I wish you</p>
<p>Peace and well-being Zhang Zhiqiang bowed</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: Rape is not a crime, so it can be a condition for divorce for two reasons. (1) Because love cannot accommodate more than one person at the same time, if he or she has already belonged to someone else, of course, his love for his wife or her love for her husband will fade. It is better to divorce frankly than to be together in appearance but separated in spirit. (2) Because human nature inevitably has a possessive desire, especially for the object of love, this possessive thought is particularly strong. Therefore, the facts of adulterers poisoning their husbands and mistresses plotting to harm their wives are endless. For safety, there is only one way to divorce.</p>
<p>Now, Zhang Jun's wife was raped by soldiers; her love for Zhang Jun, of course, has not shaken at all. And if you can forgive her, and comfort her with kind words for this encounter, her love for you will only be stronger, and there will absolutely be no problems.</p>
<p>As for soldiers raping women, it is purely a bestial act of venting lust, and there is no love involved at all. They rape a woman here today, and tomorrow they go to another place to rape another woman. They completely put yesterday's woman out of their minds, and never come back to continue courting her, or even stage a murder of her husband. Therefore, the future of Zhang Jun and his wife will not be in any danger because of this unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, we believe that Zhang Jun has no reason to separate from his wife. In terms of human feelings, you should pity her; in terms of law, you cannot treat your wife like this. The responsibility for this matter lies entirely with the illegal soldiers and their officers.</p>
<p>You say that if you keep her, your parents will not allow it; we don't think this is necessarily the case. Since they wrote to solicit your consent, of course, you still have room to speak. As for the matter of face, it is even less of a problem; you must know that if you keep your wife, people will laugh at you, and of course you cannot prevent them from doing so. But you must understand that this is their own lack of knowledge, and it has nothing to do with you.</p>

<h3>Review of "Moral Treasure Mirror"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Superficially exposes the illusion of "old morality"</p>
<p>In fact, it is preaching for "old morality"</p>
<p>Since the release of "Mad Torrent" and "The Cry of Women," the Star Film Company has in fact embarked on a new path. Of course, this change should be considered a good phenomenon in the Chinese film industry. But there are also questionable points in this. For example, "The Pipa's Spring Complaint" is close to supporting feudal forces, and this "Moral Treasure Mirror" is also preaching for old morality. At the same time, we remember that the Lianhua Film Company's "Night in the City" was criticized by the general public, but now the conclusion of "Moral Treasure Mirror" puts forward the slogan "Go to the countryside," which is undoubtedly not what our audience can accept.</p>
<p>In order to promote Chinese films on the right path with a firm and upright spirit, we must offer some necessary opinions to the authors of this film.</p>
<p>After watching this film, our audience should recognize that the director Wang Xianzhai and the screenwriter Li Nansha have indeed used a spirit of great fearlessness to expose the inside story of pseudo-morality: Zhuang Shoudao used "ancient morality and warm heart" to seduce Xiuzhu, embezzled public funds, and did not hesitate to plot money and kill, and then abandoned his ex-wife to favor a new lover, used fake military power to seize his son, and bought off lawyers to collude in deception, taught his son to follow the rules, but he himself fornicated with the maid; these all allow the audience to understand how hypocrites deceive and harm people.</p>
<p>But what do the authors of this film tell us later? Shoudao's son, Zhuang, died for "morality" out of shame and indignation, and Xiuzhu and her daughter went to the countryside out of hatred for the evils of the city.</p>
<p>Of course, in the semi-feudal Chinese society, because of the inability to abolish the private system, everyone is running around day and night with selfish and self-interested feelings, but this is definitely not a moral issue, but an actual bread issue. Precisely for this reason, how many hypocrites use the good name of morality as a tool for exploitation and deception. On the other hand, of course, there are also those who are deceived and exploited, struggling to survive in pain, and even women cannot help but sell their souls and bodies to associate with young masters. But, can we also explain these with the word "morality"? Of course, this presents a serious economic problem. Therefore, we must point out the importance of moral issues in a society with an economic system, and the inevitable destruction of the "morality" of feudal forces in a capitalist society, so we must not protect morality for the sake of morality, because it has already lost its existence: so there is no need for Zhuang Zhiqing to die for morality, not to mention that a young master who is intoxicated by the real society will not actually commit suicide due to a temporary discovery of conscience. As for the feudal countryside, it will never be "purer" than the city, not to mention that everyone already knows that "this road is impassable." At the same time, it does not seem necessary to use this scene in the progress of the plot, which is inevitably superfluous. In short, I think that in our works, when a problem cannot be solved, it is better not to solve it so that it can cause people to think deeply.</p>
<p>As for the technique, we can somewhat see that Wang Xianzhai, who is directing for the first time, does have experience in photography and is also quite clever, such as Zhuang Zhiqing calling the dancer, and the father stealing and reading his son's pornographic books. However, the entanglement between Qiu Yan and her daughter and Zhiqing has not been systematically explained. Is it saying that she and her daughter colluded to obtain money, or is it saying that she and he already had love and obtained the consent of her mother? There are other shortcomings, but I can't remember them all at once.</p>
<h3>Commentary on "Slaying the Whale, A Love Story"</h3>
<p>— Jie Ke</p>
<p>Superficial Plot, Excellent Performance</p>
<p>Ordinary Direction, Excellent Cinematography</p>
<p>City audiences, accustomed to films set against the backdrop of urban life (with exceptions, of course, like "Grand Hotel"), find it relatively easy to welcome a change of pace with films set against the backdrop of mountains and fields or the historical dramas of director Cecil B. DeMille. From the standpoint of the film industry, it's also a considerable outlet. Cathay's premiere of "Slaying the Whale, A Love Story" yesterday used whaling ships as its selling point. While it cannot be said to be a top-notch film, it still proved quite engaging. In any case, it's a significant improvement over the last two films, which were almost perfunctory. Although there was no newsreel before the main feature, the musical numbers and cartoons that took its place were a definite improvement over the previous film's tiresome dog act.</p>
<p>The plot of "Slaying the Whale, A Love Story" is simple and superficial, but some of the twists and turns may be difficult for those who haven't read the synopsis beforehand to understand. The film opens with an inscription commemorating the havoc wreaked by the giant whale "Moby Dick" on American coastal shipping, which is acceptable. However, the relationship between the young heroes Ahab and Daniel as brothers is not very clear. The fact that Ahab, after accumulating capital seven years later, acquired his own ship and became its captain is also not very clear. The sailors' mutiny and Ahab's use of force to suppress it are also not clearly depicted.</p>
<p>The film's storyline is based on Herman Melville's novel "Moby Dick." The setting is between 1838 and 1850, so 19th-century costumes are used. The cinematography of the sea ships and whaling scenes in the film is very good. The lighting and framing of the scene where Ahab and the minister's daughter, Phyllis, meet at home is very gentle and charming. The lighting in the wharf and inn scenes is too poor. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted to show the conditions of the 19th century, but the Singapore scene is very well done. This film is somewhat like a dubbed version of an old silent film, but this is not certain.</p>
<p>John Barrymore, who plays the hero Ahab, gives an excellent and energetic performance. Joan Bennett, who plays the minister's daughter Phyllis, is also very gentle and moving. Her enunciation is the clearest and most pleasant to listen to. The entire film consists only of individual actions, with little direction to speak of, resulting in scenes that seem disjointed. The other actors are merely echoing voices.</p>
<h3>Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone Finally Announce Their Divorce</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xian</p>
<p>The long-rumored divorce case of Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone has now come to an end. The May issues of American film magazines each contain an article documenting this major event in the American film industry. Ironically, they each claimed to have exclusive interviews with Joan Crawford, but all the newspapers ended up having the same information. I will now compile the accounts from various film magazines, extracting the main points as follows:</p>
<p>Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone are not divorcing, but separating, which is the most important point Joan Crawford announced to the film magazine reporters. The difference between divorce and separation is: if they were divorced, both parties would be free to marry again without interference from the other party; but they are only separating, and neither party intends to marry again. They are now living apart but have not completed the legal procedures for divorce, so if either party wishes to remarry in the future, the legal procedures for divorce will need to be completed.</p>
<p>This separation, although only referred to as a separation, has been agreed upon by both parties and has legal effect, meaning that neither party is obliged to fulfill the marital duties of cohabitation. Therefore, it is also called a "legal separation." Whether there is such a provision or term in the law is not investigated here, but it is known that Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone have both agreed to adhere to it firmly. Some say that their separation this time is only temporary, and there may still be hope for reconciliation in the future. However, according to those close to both parties, they have definitively ruled out the possibility of cohabiting again. The reason is that their separation this time was the final decision made out of desperation. It is said that they have actually been separated for eight months, and during those eight months, they tried every possible way to restore their previous level of love, but all failed. They also traveled to Europe, hoping to use the power of a second honeymoon to salvage their fading romance. Unfortunately, that second honeymoon was only like an anesthetic to relieve pain, temporarily relieving the pain but not removing the source of the disease. Therefore, after they returned to Hollywood, they immediately realized that there was no hope of recovering their past love. So, after a long period of consideration, mutual discussion, and with the approval of the experienced old Franchot Tone, they separated. This was an extremely careful decision, leaving no room for reconciliation.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for their separation? According to Joan Crawford's own account, it has nothing to do with jealousy, nor is there a third party involved. She said that she likes boyfriends, but her boyfriends are also friends of her husband; she likes to dance, but when she goes out, her husband often goes with her, or there must be other friends accompanying her, and she has never gone out alone with a boyfriend. As for her husband's girlfriends, she also knows them and often invites them to her house. Therefore, neither she nor her husband had an affair with anyone else. This is why she only mentions separation and not divorce. Joan has no intention of remarrying. She said, "My first marriage has already failed; why try a second time? As for Douglas (Franchot Tone's first name), he also has no intention of remarrying in the near future."</p>
<p>So, why did they separate? More on this tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Clara Bow Adopts Twin Children</h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>This publication recently reported that Clara Bow, while in France, did not buy foreign clothes but exclusively used American domestic goods, which has aroused considerable praise from this publication's readers, saying that this "hot" lady is enthusiastic about domestic goods, unlike the fashionable women in our country. Now news has come that this Ms. Bow has adopted a pair of twin boys and girls from a poor family, which shows that patriotism begins with love for one's family: doing good must start with one's own brothers. It is quite different from those "charity eaters" in our country who donate thousands or tens of thousands to the poor outside, but turn a cold shoulder to relatives who borrow from them once or twice, which shows that their "goodness" is fake and their wealth is scraped from others. Clara Bow and her husband Rex Bell returned to Europe and their former residence. She gave many gifts to poor relatives, at least ensuring that they would not suffer from cold or hunger for a winter. In the midst of this economic downturn in America, this kind of good deed is a great blessing to them. One day, the couple went to a humble family's house and saw the lovely Lili, and they wanted to take her to Hollywood. But Lili and John are not only twins, but also very loving. John, seeing that Lili was about to leave him, was overcome with grief and cried. Later, Clara, not wanting to see the twins, brother and sister, who were born from the same mother's womb, receive different education and treatment and become people of two different classes in the future, so she took John along as well.</p>
<h3>Public Screening of "The Moral Compass"</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company's new film "The Moral Compass" (formerly known as "The Thief of Humanity") premiered on the second at the Central Theater. The film is a powerful satire of the hypocrisy of false philanthropists. The acting is quite commendable, and the direction is also quite clever.</p>

<h3>Film Novel 42nd Street (Part 4)</h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>When the dance practice dismissed, Pantell was still outside the theater. Pantell saw Dorothy run off with Abner Dillon, and felt frustrated, but he cheered up a lot when he saw Pankie. Pantell was older than Billy Lawler, but also a bit more handsome in some ways. Pantell made a few passes at Pankie, and they went out for dinner. After dinner, they rode the bus back to Forty-second Street together, and had become bosom friends. Pankie saw that Pantell was a bit depressed, and asked him what was making him sad. Pantell smiled wryly and told her the story of his love affair with another successful chorus girl, and asked for her opinion on the matter. Pankie advised him to start over.</p>
<p>Before closing the door, Pankie looked back frequently, signaling her goodnight to Pantell. On one of her last glances, she spied two shadows closing on his body on the curb. One of them just managed to say something.</p>
<p>"We've got a message for someone called Pantell. Buttnin," he threatened. "If he doesn't lay off Dorothy Brock, he's gonna get a beating! Buttnin, got it?"</p>
<p>Before the other man could answer, the first man reached out with his right hand and punched Pantell hard. Pantell fell to the ground with a thud, and the first thug immediately jumped into the waiting car, while the second thug stayed behind to kick the fallen man hard in the ribs before jumping into the car and speeding away.</p>
<p>Pankie screamed in terror and ran down the steps to help Pantell up.</p>
<p>The next day, Pantell accepted an offer from a theater in Philadelphia, preparing to leave without saying goodbye to Dorothy. But as Pantell packed his bags, Dorothy suddenly arrived.</p>
<p>Pantell felt a heavy weight in his heart and didn't have the courage to kiss her goodbye, because he knew, and she knew, that after a kiss, they wouldn't be able to bear it. Pantell got up and walked to the window. Dorothy didn't wipe away her tears either, and blindly groped towards the door. "Goodbye, Pantell," he choked out.</p>
<p>Pantell didn't turn around. (To be continued)</p>
