<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北善後信</h3>
<p>中日停戰協定簽字後。流血之戰爭。巳暫告一段落。不津人心亦得暫時稍安。然存心挑戰之日本。是否就此罷手。吾人實不敢懸測。蓋其國内之文治派及深識世界現勢者。雖皆力主趕速恢復平時狀態。以便開拓在華市塲。其　頇成性之軍閥。尙不肯就此罷兵。故津東所駐日軍。不肯爽快撤退。借故遷延况察哈爾省早爲日本所覬覦張家口之前衛即爲多倫。而多倫又爲我國内地與蒙旗交通之要道。日人蓄意侵略。故於侵襲灤東之前。即派騎兵。襲佔多倫。今者馮玉祥之抗日同盟軍。雖巳取銷。而日軍是否不再　詞前。　吾人於此。無從置論。故察事之善後。亦無從談。</p>
<p>今日華北之善後可以一談者。在外交上爲津東如何接收。内政上爲此區域中之僞軍如何處置。流離失所之難民如何安插。日方果有誠意言。則日軍撤退。應無問題。萬一不幸而彼仍恃武力。則我方猶不能漫無準備。以再蹈過去之覆轍。僞軍之處置。亦宜盡力抗爭。務須澈底解决。不使其再爲虎倀。以危害我國家。至於救濟難民。更爲最重要而最困難之事。如若沿用振濟災區之成法。籌欵佈施。苟能渡過目前。即以爲平安無事。則吾人期期以爲未可。蓋此次慘遭兵燹之津東各縣。一迫於戰爭時期之供應。再受日軍飛機之轟炸。現在又威受僞軍之蹂躪。其能倖存者鮮矣。目前之彌補。固必不可缺。而根本工作。則爲城市破毁之復興。農村殘敗之重振。在在須侍當地人民血汗之努力。尤賴政府當局之積李援助。不僅在政治上建立一般的社會秩序。使人民得安其居即爲盡責。且須在經濟的實質上予手工業及小商業以特殊助力。使得迅復業。農民得迅速就其土地以從事於耕種。政府更資以耕具及耕種必需之資本。則津東之殘破。庶可復興。</p>
<p>吾人縱觀我國全境。農村喪落。殆巳成爲極普遍之病象。不僅某一地區爲然特以華北爲最甚耳。蓋我國文明極盛時代。端在華北。而農村又爲立　之基礎。質言之。數千年來政治上之財政。皆依託於農民。而對於土地之改良。則向多忽視。地力有限培殖無方。遂漸呈衰竭之象。若再不及時挽救。恐一二百年後。如開封附近地域。將不免變成沙漠。其他膏腴之地。亦將化爲　土。且黃河。流域各省如河北山西河南等。更有一極大之危機。即雅片嗎啡紅丸是也。雅片之害巳爲世所共知。而嗎啡紅丸之毒。則十百倍於雅片。近其流毒巳深入農村。士紳間亦多染之。此種現象。非但毒害當時。且將遺禍後世。使我中華民族永陷於不能自拔之悲　。現在華北軍事告一段落。正謀與民更始。則切盼當局。對於毒物之流行。更應加以極嚴厲之取締。亦未始非培養元氣之一道也。</p>

<h3>局勢有新轉機</h3>
<p>美代表提重要議案　　主張逐漸癈除人爲的貿易障壁　　華府同時發表文告　　認通貨臨時穩定計畫今非其時</p>
<h3>羅斯福親信摩萊啓程赴英</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美國務卿赫爾今日向世界經濟大會提出甚重要議案、意在成立逐漸廢除人爲的貿易障碍之基礎、聞此案之目的、在迫令經濟委員會殷法以應付各種貿易障碍、此案係以美國代表團名義提出、與美國發來訓令相付、此案内容如下、「各國」方面對於進口貨加以稅率限額禁令等性質之限制、一方面復津貼輸出此種趨勢、致生各國皆採國家主義的行爲之結果、此種行爲苟推行至於極度、則其結果勢必爲國際貿易之完全消滅、與中古時代閉關主義之恢復、欲恢復世界元氣而維持適當的生活程度、則此趨勢必須遏止之、因此理由、故提議參加世界經濟大會之各國須依允㈠採用或繼續極端經濟的國家主義之政策、而續頒行貿易上之障碍或歧視、乃違反各國共同利益之舉動、㈡禁令進口限額·及其他各種專斷的限制、應及早完全撤除、㈢關稅壁壘應以互惠的雙方或多方協定儘速裁減至貿易可再照常自由流動之點、㈣在締結雙方或</p>
<p>多方協定時、應注意不得注入歧視的特質、因此種特質雖與締約國有利、然有害於整個的世界貿易也、」（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國會塲今日發生要文告、反對通貨之臨時穩定、謂有若干方面對於臨時固定通貨計盡之考慮、予以過分之重視云、此非美代表團之事、考慮此計盡者、爲英美法財政部與中央銀行之代表、而代表美財部者爲史潑萊氏、美政府現覺臨時穩定計畫今非其時、美政府以爲美國提高物價之努力、甚有助於大會之成功、凡可妨害此極努力而釀成物價之暴跌者、其損害之會之程度、較之未有　貨臨時穩定之治標辦法者爲尤甚、美官塲文告言及最後目的物、謂美代表團巳提出一議案、目的在促成全世界不穩定的通貨之最後穩定、美代表團並贊助凡可成立一致的國　貨幣政策、以期振興經濟活動而增高物價者之計畫云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國務卿赫爾今日提交輕濟委員會之議案、乃美代表團前所提出後復撤退的减稅什一案之代替品、今日議案文乃美代表出國前在華盛頓擬就者、今日因奉美總統訓令乃發表之、衆信此舉可使會務在美總統親信顧問摩萊敎授賚美總統特殊訓令抵英以前、不致停頓云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>大會組織失之繁複</p>
<h3>穩定通貨美德爲梗</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日世界經濟會議情形不過拖延時日、顯似靜待美國務副卿摩萊之來英、若干代表則稱會議組織失之笨重、不良於運用、未免稍覺失望、會議秘書處曾將會中組織製成圖表、分送各代表參考、其圖表形狀直類一株大樹、除兩大委員會與七小組委員會外、復有若干新小組、正在考慮之中、各小組委員雖逐日會商、幾乎每一行動、輒有人詢及美國態度、顧美代表則守口如瓶、顯似正待摩萊之新訓令、惟摩萊非至下星期不能到英、因此一般人對於會議之熱心、亦不免漸見衰减、蓋此會自開幕以來、迄今詳細討論者僅一安定貨幣問題、現幾乎各國皆願立時安定、獨美德兩國爲之中梗、以故一般人皆亟望摩萊來英後或能轉移形勢也、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）照今日情形、美德爾國實爲安定通貨計畫之大梗、其他各國則在大體上咸可贊同、法·意·瑞士·波蘭·挪威·布加利亞·瑞典·希臘·阿根廷·與羅馬尼亞十國、尤堅持穩定貨幣爲提高物價最良方法、</p>
<p>美國態度據聞雖亦準　贊同一種安定計畫、但其所欲安定之金元價格未免過低、爲他國所不願接受、設美國果如報紙所傳提出英美匯價四元四角之議、逆料英國將首先拒絕討論、</p>
<p>德國則又與美國不同、係不贊成加入安定自巳貨幣之平坦的協定、德代表曾承認即令美英法商得切實協定、德國亦將堅持對於自己貨幣政策得以自由處置、不受拘束、蓋純粹國家主義之見地、</p>
<p>頃聞歐洲各中央銀行所贊成之安定計畫、曾規定一種保持常態基金、供德國處置、藉以勸導其加入安定貨幣協定、惟迄於深夜止、德美兩國仍主贊同此種計盡、德代表聲稱、德國不願擔任一種金本位義務、但亦鄭重聲明此種態度並非表示德國有早日放棄金本位之意、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>美國務副卿</p>
<h3>離國前發聲明</h3>
<p>擬予代表團以新背景　　希望會議獲切實效果　　（紐約）羅斯福總統之親信顧問國務卿摩萊敎授今日乘滿哈坦號郵船啓程赴倫敦之前聲稱、柒所携總統之訓令、並不含有特殊命令性質、又稱、外間謠傳羅總統將親自參與會議、未必能然也、自美代表團赴倫敦後、局勢己有種種發展、渠覺今予美代表以新背景、必有所裨補也、渠意近兩星期内大會之初步會議、極有益於探討實際行動之可能、美代表團行將積極進行彼等首途前所製定之計畫、美國預料美代表團之努力、必獲切實之結果、摩萊昨與羅斯福總統作最後一分鐘之會</p>
<p>商、以聆羅之最後訓令、此間一般人士皆以爲徼近顚躓之倫敦談話、將因以獲新生命、且信摩萊與總　統之接商、即在摩氏抵倫敦之前、倫敦方面巳有所感覺矣、華盛頓人士仍以爲穩定貨幣之舉、不必亟亟進行、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）摩氏離美前曾往麻州海濱總統游艇作密談、但所談内容未允發表、僅稱、美國當可希望經濟會議第二期能有切實結果、且對於此語亦不允再加甲釋按經濟會議初期旣屬討論安定貨幣問題、因此金融家多疑摩萊所言、恐未必指貨幣問題、（廿一日國民電）</p>
<p>白宮新訓令</p>
<h3>引起各方面懸揣</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於羅斯　寄與美國代表團之新訓令、其内容如何、雖尙無人道及、然此間人士以爲新訓令必係令美國各代表不可有任何作爲、使妥協之門爲之關閉、新訓令措詞必甚和緩云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務副卿摩萊携總統新訓令前赴倫敦、據消息　通者方、摩萊所帶之訓令、不見能使美國代表團大改其政策、美國工商業現巳漸有起色、摩萊抵倫之時、　堅囑美國代表團對於任何建議、凡與美國内政計畫不能密切相合者、不可表示贊成云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>赫爾仍留駐倫敦</h3>
<p>（倫敦）聞美代表赫　在經濟會議期中將不離去倫敦、外傳波將返美之說不確、穩定通貨之建議、大約須待摩萊敎授蒞此、始能告一段落、但亦僅一暫時之協定而巳、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>英相請美代表團</p>
<h3>通貨談判守秘密</h3>
<p>免致妨碍會議進行　　（倫敦）今日美代表團接到華盛盛重要來電後、英首相麥唐納即與美代表團中數人討論一切、據聞麥唐納求美代表團將穩定通貨之談判嚴守秘密、俾使經濟會議得以進行其他問題、同時令市塲不致爲穩定通貨之謠言所動搖云、美代表團巳允暫時不再向外間發表關於穩定通貨之消息云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>美代表守口如瓶</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日貨幣洽標小組委員會歐洲代表曾全日迫美代表庫仁士說明何者爲美國所欲爲、庫氏仍無所表示、但據報載則美總統將自提一種安定提議、此間咸信美總統眞意、凡足以國内證劵物品跌價之任何安定金元辦法、均不願贊同、因目下美國物價之上升、大半由於金元跌價所致、所以苟欲安定金元、必使其價値</p>
<p>處於極低地位而後可云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>法總揆態度消極</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法總理達拉第近日對於倫敦世界經濟會議、似巳抱消極之態度、蓋彼今日聲稱、因國會事務過繁、日後倘返倫敦、亦僅能作短時間之勾留、再則彼巳决定於七月十四日遄返其故鄉奥蘭治一行、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>歐洲通貨休戰</h3>
<p>安定通貨遲遲不前　　小國代表漸感不耐　　（巴黎）美元穩定似巳無望、法國金融界現乃設法擬暫時固定金鎊與佛　之匯價、此舉將造成歐洲通貨休戰、而不包括美國在内、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）現歐洲各小國之代表等對於穩定通貨之舉、遲遲不前、頗爲不耐、故巳申請經濟會議中列　集中力量、覓求種包括歐洲各國之協定云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>美俄談話</p>
<h3>貿易問題意見接近</h3>
<p>兩國復交開啟端倪　　（倫敦）美國之承認蘇俄、仍有許多障碍、昨經兩國出席經濟會議代表　參議員庫仁士與俄副總代表梅勞克、在午餐席上暢談兩小時後、俄方巳獲知梗槪、今日曾由梅勞克將談話情形電告莫斯科蓋此次談話雖完全非正式、但雙方俱各報告本國政府、據聞兩國間關係商務方面、並無困難問題、所有障碍皆在商務以外、庫仁士曾詳告梅勞克、非俟此項障碍消除後、則美國國内對於承認問題、仍將有强烈之反對、如美國勞工聯合會·美國退伍軍人會·及其他大團體均爲反對承認之中心點、非俟蘇俄保證不以强制工作之貨物運入美國、與不令蘇俄團體干預美國勞工團體後、則美國勞工聯合會不能贊成復交、又如美國敎堂對於承認問題、雖態度寛大、但亦欲俄國在一切條約内保證信仰自由、至於許多金融機關則非俟俄國承認帝俄及克倫斯基時代欠美債欵願開討論後、不能贊成復交、更有一部份美國與論則欲俄國脫離第三國際、此外復有數種政治問題則逆料尙不難解决、嗣雙方談論貿易問題、爲時頗久、尤注意於合理的信用貿易、俾俄國可以在美多購貨物、梅氏聲稱、苟能完全恢復外交關係與擴充信用範圍、則兩國貿易必可大有增加、聞庫氏事先曾聲明渠並非代表美政府發言、不過論述事實、至對於經濟會議中問題、則雙方頗多同意之處、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<h3>貨幣委員會</h3>
<p>白銀小組開會　　畢特門主席　　希望早日成立協定　　限制銀供給與抛售　　（倫敦）經濟會議貨幣委員會討論白銀之小組委員會、今晨開會、由美國代表畢德曼主席、討論甚久、决定以畢德曼决議案第二部份、作爲討論基礎、該决議案之第二部份、係主張各中央銀行之準備金内百分之若干、使用白銀是也、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日白銀小組委員會開會後、主席畢德門向記者聲稱、委員會内巳有如斯滿意之進步、七國一致努力以造成銀價不穩定、爲期當巳不遠、或者下星期初即有具體化之可能、此種努力將求獲致限制白銀生產與出售之總協定、渠企圖在星期杪集合美國加拿大墨西哥玻璃維亞秘魯印度與中國代作非正式談話、商榷此事、至今晨小組委員會會議情形、至可令人滿意云云、聞畢氏在會議時曾有演說、建議產銀國與藏銀國宜早日締結協定、限制白銀之供給與出售、謂美國願立即加入此種談判、望印度以有限制之白銀售與市場、又謂美國星期六在貨幣委員會提出之决議案、其宗旨首即在重建金本　位爲全世界度量幣　價之準繩、惟復建金本位必須使用白銀以爲輔佐俾彼無充分黃金之國家、亦得購買金本位國家之貨物、並力言銷燬銀幣所造成之不自然的供給、必須趕急停止、當畢德門在白銀小組委員會進行美國白銀計劃時、美總代表赫爾亦在經濟委員會提出一重要决議案、（内容見前）（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>白銀問題</p>
<h3>中美意見牴牾</h3>
<p>（倫敦）中美對於白銀問題之意見與目的、實相牴牾、美國願有一公開之銀市塲、而中國則主張使白銀有穩定之價格、而其流動之自由在他方面受最低可能的限度之限制、現美代表畢特門與辦理銀問題之小組委員會須調和雙方異見、使歸一致、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>治標小組</p>
<h3>討論英國提案</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日世界經濟會議之經濟委員會及貨幣委員會兩個小組會、仍繼續工作、英財相張伯倫在第一小組會所提出之議案、許多代表今日皆發表意見、表示贊同、法財長飛萊建議、該議案應交付一特别小組會考慮、然後迅速提出建議書云云、並稱節制生產固屬必要、但同時亦須提高消耗力、俾世界人類之痛苦、得告一段落、渠贊成金融鬆廉之政策、爲治本之方法、但在市場中之活動、尙須專家之嚴密考慮云、意代表　尼杜斯對此原則上表示同意、但稱、欲謀自由放欵政策、對於物價發生所希冀之作用、須預防各方利用債欵爲投機之活動、否則雖可暫時造成一種虚僞之繁榮、但結果必將又造成一重大之危機也云（廿一日路透電、</p>

<h3>經濟委員會</h3>

<h3>主席剛柔並濟</h3>
<p>（倫敦荷蘭首相柯里恩博士爲經濟委員會主席、處置會務、頗具剛柔並濟之手腕、今晨有若干委員反對下午三時開會、以爲午餐後時間過於侷促、建議於三時半開會、柯里恩曰甚好、吾人於午前提早半小時辦公如何、於是平時晏起之英人以爲午前十時半開會、爲時過早、主席復徐徐言曰、甚好、吾人不妨於午前十一時及午後三時半開會、但午後會議、須繼續至六時半而非六時云、至是縮减辦公時間之意思、爲柯里恩一言所打銷、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>俄提案被擱置</h3>
<p>（倫敦）經濟小組委員會内蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫所提締結經濟不侵略公約之議、業因主席德代表克羅格曼拒絕立付討論之動議暫被擱置、英商部大臣任鍚曼曾稱、渠信因政治作用而施之某種貿易限制、係屬合法行動、若僅爲經濟理由則應當取消、任氏此語蓋對蘇俄與愛爾蘭而發（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<h3>英愛經濟衝突</h3>

<p>是次選舉揭曉、德國社會勞工黨、即德國法西斯黨、又稱右黨得票數最大、此次全</p>
<p>國會共選出代表六四七人、而法西斯黨佔二八八議席、當總數百分之四三·二加入黑白紅戰線與右派同方向之集團、可得三四○議席、當何組成議會政府多數派、從而德國兩年來有國會存在、而無議會政治这混謎政治局面、可在形式上得以恢復議會政治、此種結果、旣如政府之所期望、亦滿國人之所祝禱從而希拉忒領導下的法西斯黨十四年來奔走呼號的救國運動、至是獲得其躍進議會舞臺操縱政治的最後希望、與最大勝利矣、此種猛進勝利、因基於前述理由與原因、早巳如其所期、無足見怪、但共產黨與社會民主黨選民票數、雖經政府之種種威凌、難於擒制與障礙、兩黨合計尙得議席二○一、較前次選舉結果不過略減十餘議席耳、實爲出人意料之外、於此可是左派戰綫、不論處於如何嚴挌的政治威壓之下、尙不失爲德國政治之重心、其次各黨均無若何重大變化、再就此次選舉全體事實觀察、參加選舉的選民人數、達百分之九十八有奇、此舉參與選　成份熱烈之澎漲現象、開德國選舉空前未有之最高紀錄、推共原因、當然也是由於國會被焚、人心大受剌激、左右鬭爭、日趨尖銳化、人民於此嚴重時期、不容再作緘默、不屬於左、即投於右、人人於此時當有迅速的自决心及其對於政治命運之明顯表示、是以參加選舉票數成分之高、良亦全由時勢所造成也、</p>
<h3>新國會之新工作及其意義</h3>
<p>新國會的意義爲何、一言以蔽之、法西斯支配下的右傾國會是也、自此新國會之產生、而希特忒獨裁的内閣政治益得鞏固而强健的權勢基礎、同時亦即德國民主政治宣告破產及極左方向的德國共產黨被受宣告死刑的開端、此次新國會共產黨雖仍佔議席八一位、但當此新國會召集第一次議員會議時、共產黨的議員皆被擯斥、得不到議會的開會請帖、無權列席開會、於此即可見共產黨被迫程度如何深刻、而法西斯右派操縱議會獨裁權勢之如何偉大、蓋法西斯黨向來之主張是要根本　除布爾札維亞的共產主義、取消馬克斯階級爭鬭的理論、及打倒虚僞的民主政治制度、茲者德國内閣旣爲希特忒所主掌、同時國會又爲法西斯黨所獨佔、是以彼等之主張經國會第一次會議修改維瑪憲法提案通過後、即得（柏林通信）（公安）</p>
<p>全盤實現、左派巳完全處置於政府鐵蹄踐踏之下、其手段正亦可謂酷辣之極、新國會開會因舊會塲被焚、曾改在嘉爾絲敎堂臨時地址、其情勢甚形狼狽、查政府所以取决嘉爾絲敎堂爲臨時國會會塲原因、係因該敎堂停放有德國威　第二皇帝的遺骸、威皇係對德國有最大建功立業的貢獻、今德國處於四分五裂的危難時代、甚望全國代表降臨、對此先烈而有所警覺與團結、進一步言之、或因此借重有龍盤虎踞的風水英雄關係、亦未可料、然無論如何、德國國會會場不得巳而改遷、與我中國南京之遷都洛陽未免同具國難意義、此則將成爲德國法西斯操政之歷史價値、現在則巳遷回柏林枯慮戲院爲會所矣、目前其最要工作約有下列數端、（一）澈底完成國家革命、（二）努力完全實現法西斯的國家主義、（三）根本肅淸全國共產黨、（四）實行對猶太人人經濟絕交及暫不合作主義、（五）恢復德國之光榮、</p>
<h3>結論</h3>
<p>由德國國會之被焚以至國會第三次再選之經過、及其現在之政績、其中所演之政象、雖屬錯綜紛雜、令人難以索解、但就整個一貫事實而言、確可稱之爲德國國家革命、蓋自國會被焚後以至現在、雜瑪憲法巳被修改、全國政府機關一律强制改組、共產黨重要份子均遭逮捕、全國總工會亦被解散、猶太人不准當敎授·律師·醫生·及其他公家官吏、及在大學肄業、全國禁絕不准掛戰後黑白黃的共和國旗、而要標揚戰前帝皇光榮時代黑白紅國旗、及法西斯運動的萬字黨旗、爲了此等事變、目前之德國的確較三月前之德國有絕對不同之社會面目與政治空氣、在德國自身而言、當然亦以此種革命爲必要、甚至認爲當前解决德國黨爭分裂的唯一出路、議會大多數的政府黨旣得產生、國會可得回復常態、不致政局常處飄搖動盪、多生競選之煩擾、在德國人民之本身利害而方、固可引爲政局安定之撫慰、赤化的危險、亦巳消滅、其不願共產之國民、誰不額手慶幸、資本家可得安枕無憂、法西斯黨又爲反對凡爾賽條約最劇烈政黨、然而取消凡爾賽條約早係全國一致之願望與要求、就此觀點而言、法西斯黨今日上塲操縱德國政治、亦祇得樂受民衆之歡迎、决無敵對之理、總之、由於德國數年來左右兩極端派鬭爭情勢之激烈、及其右傾趨向之明顯、觀之則今日德國國家革命、必爲必然之結果、早爲記者所料及、所以亦不足爲奇、但排斥猶太人之仇視種族運動、吾人以爲在歐洲文明社會有此奇怪行動、未免深爲</p>
<p>歐洲之所謂文明一歎、猶太人旣係與德國人同屬德國國籍、同隸於政府統治之下、同居德國國内、即係操有經濟大權、亦係爲德國　用、並屬於德國國民財富、何必相煎若呈之急、左派因有破壞國家的暴動嫌疑、是必爲國家相當處置、世界均同一理、吾人固亦不用費詞、說彼短長、但因是德國國民又要失去其倍仰言論及集會之自由權、要是羅蘭夫人尙健在、不曉得他又要爲不自由的政治如何痛哭、不過某個社會或某種國家爲適應其固有社會利害與關係起見、則有採用與其時其地相當辦法、以資應付、此亦政治之常規、至關於新國會今後前途問題、因政府與國會巳形成密切的合作關係、更因少了議會左派戰綫的敵對、其政治基礎旣得非常固、論理此次新生國會將有長期政治發展之可能性、祇以經濟恐慌程度日形危險化、失業工人人數　增無巳、德國現在平均每十人中即有一人失業、國會究竟有何策略和計畫、救此恐慌、此則完全有繋於國會今後之命運問題也、（五月五日）</p>

<h3>先鑄在洋單角</h3>
<p>銅幣暫仍舊狀　　銀行公會意見　　本市銀行業同業公會、前奉財政部命令、擬具對改革銀輔幣之意見、經該會呈復財部、建議開鑄十進銀輔幣、以資統一幣制、國聞社記者、昨探悉其辦法如左、</p>
<h3>鼓鑄單角</h3>
<p>據銀行公會呈復財政部　　之意見、宜先行鑄單角大　　洋、銀輔幣十進計算、每十　　枚當大洋一元、如是則可避免貼水虧損、統一幣制、並可遏制市價混亂、最好並鑄五分銀輔幣、俾便利施用、惟五分銀輔幣是否開鑄、尙待討論、嗣後劣質小洋雙毫逐漸收回、可以穩定市面不少、</p>
<h3>銅幣仍舊</h3>
<p>至於銅幣價格混亂不堪　　誠有關市况、惟銀行公會　　方面意見、假如以十進之法、統一銅幣、則誠恐一般貧苦人民、大受影響、蓋貧民生活、大都以銅幣交易、一旦銅幣以十進計合銀幣、而銅幣交易貨物之物價、一仍其舊、則一般貧苦人民之生活、將不堪維持、故對於銅幣制度、將暫仍舊狀云、</p>

<p>日報載石射總領事之報告據六月十四日東京朝日新聞載上海石射總領事報告云、此次南京政府之改正關稅稅率、影響日貨市塲如下、（一）受影響最大者、爲綿裂品·煤·水泥·海產物等物、緣三年來關稅提高、中國海關採用金單位制、以及抵制日貨等故、漸使上海地方之綿布加工業發達、而日貨中之棉製品、屬於從量稅者、殆巳杜絕輸入、即在一九三十年、爲四千百萬海關兩、至一千九百三十一年、減少五百五十萬海關兩、最近因圓價暴落、計算有利之從價稅品、如印染等物、亦變爲從量課稅、結果比舊稅率、增高一五至七○、遂致輸入更感困難、（二）現在上海之棉布加工工塲、由中英日人經營之染塲、達七八十以上、其他在無鍚漢口蕪湖寗波等、亦有數處、今後中國綿布加工業、愈爲發達、日貨輸出之前途、殊堪憂慮、（三）海產物因抵制日貨、輸入于上海者頓減、當千九百三十二年、計三十八萬海關兩、不及平年之一成、若排日緩和、則海參·干貝·魷魚·鹹鮝·紫菜·鮑魚·香菇等、獨在上海、達六百萬海關兩之輸入、其間鹹鮝、受中國貨之影響甚大、（四）紙類一門、如報紙·香烟用紙·有光紙·包紮用紙·硫酸紙·圖畫紙等等、增加三成至五成六分、一面市價約高二成、（五）</p>
<p>煤在一千九百三十年爲百六十五萬噸、至千九百三十二年、僅十五萬噸、水泥亦然、（六）木材美國木材、約增高一成、而日本木材、除鐵道枕木外、增加二成以上至十九成四分、遂致日本木材、不能與俄美二國貨相競爭、前因排日、今又施行高稅率、將來日本木材、勢必受重大打　、（七）電泡、稅率約增高十成、自不能與當地出品相競爭、他如由日本輸入之套鞋·硫化染料·鐘表用附屬品等、亦有相當增高、雜貨品中受致命的打撃者、爲數尤多云、[P&lt;陳公博昨接見銀行界P]</p>

<h3>本年長江水位之推論朱墉</h3>
<p>旬日以來、長江上海水位飛漲、巳引起時人之注意、而論者每以今次漢口水位之高爲一八七零年來同月所未有、遂以爲民國二十年時大水災之空前浩刦、又將重臨、懲前毖後、固可藉以促當局之注意、而揆之事實、則未必盡然、蓋水位之升降、原於雨景之多寡、雨量之多寡、系乎氣象之　更、就世界各國最悠久之紀錄、以推測各該地之水位、可得相當之週率、如法之丹勃河與沙恩河之爲患、類閱四百餘年而一見、意之大伯河在三百七十五年前曾遭水患災、但至今迄未再見、足證水之爲災、究非常有之事、惟中國水政失修、偶遇霪霖、卽釀巨患、然亦似有相當之週率、惟其詳細記錄、歷時未久、推測自難、揚子江水位記載、肇自一八六八年、至今巳歷六十五年、在此六十餘年中、每約經十年、似必發現一高紀錄、如一之三一年、一九二一年、一九一一年、一九○一年、一八八九年、以及一八七八年是也、苟按此例以推、則本年當不至發生大水、然亦有不能據爲定論者在、茲分論於次、</p>
<p>漢口水位之重要、漢口居全國中部、不特爲内地商業中心、且爲沿江水位之樞紐、以其地居江漢合流之點、自此上溯、各有廣　之流　、漢水流域在江之北、範圍較小、河身亦窄、故其漲勢猛而暫、惟江水源遠流長、浩瀚東下、迨其旣漲、不易卽落、惟無論爲江爲襄、一方有暴漲、均足以升高漢口之水位、倘二水漲期不同、則先後由江下注、漢口水位不致激增、否則二水同時並漲、則漢口之江面益高、此其一、</p>
<p>雨永年各不同、而河槽之洩量則有一定之限制、苟逾此限、勢必泛濫、惟有湖泊以分洩之、亦可弭患於一時、故歷代江患較遜於河、以江有洞庭鄱陽二湖爲之瀦蓄也、近年鄱陽淤塞、江流惟藉洞庭爲挹注之所、今洞庭復日見淺隘、漢口水位及乃益形重要、蓋江水旣抵漢口、自此而下、别無分洩之途、漢口成災、則自漢以東各繁盛他區、均有沉淪之患、此其二、</p>
<p>綜上原因、漢口水位之升降、爲客界人士視綫所集中、非無故而然也、</p>
<p>漢口水位曲綫之槪况、查漢口水位曲綫、每年五六月間例有一度之升漲、至六七月間停止或稍低落、再逾一二旬又復高漲、而最高度則在八月、或七月下旬、過此則一往下降、直至次年二月、無復有倐起倐落之現象矣、</p>
<p>去年漢口水位、五月下旬曾漲三十五呎、六月上旬漲至三十六呎、與民國二十年同時期水位相差不足二呎、人民當創巨痛深之後、莫不相驚失色、以爲前例可循大禍將至、孰知自此以後、逐日下降、六月中旬又落至三十二呎、至八月中旬最高水位僅四十四呎有奇、</p>
<p>本年漢口水位之推測、茲就過去之水位曲綫、以推本年之水位曲綫、試取六十年中高水位曲線、如一九三一年一九二六年一八七○年、求其平均數之曲線如「甲線一、又取六十年中低水位曲線如一九○○年一九一六年一九二八年、求其平均數之曲線如「乙線」以「甲」「乙」二線及民國二十年水位線如「丙線」、與本水位線相比較、可知本年六月水位之高、實開六十年來未有之新紀錄、面與去年最高水位巳不相上下、再衡以歷年漲水之慣例、在今後之一月、上游及中游各地如雨澤稀少、在二百公厘（約六寸）左右、則水位曲線當如「子線」、如雨量適中、在三百五十公厘左右、且支配均匀、則水位曲綫將如「丑綫」、最高度在四十八呎以下、漢口市街尙不致湮没、非然者、超過四百公厘而至五百公厘以上、則水位之激增、將如「寅綫」、不知伊於胡底矣、</p>
<p>本年有發水之可能性、逾分之水量、不能得逾分之河槽、則宣洩不暢、瀦蓄無地、勢必泛濫潰决、釀成巨災、故治水者於湖泊之外、更於深山大谷之中、建築水庫、以資蓄洩、至於兩岸堤埝、尤宜寛展以暢其流、古者與水爭地、懸爲厲禁、民二十年國府亦有廢田還湖之議、乃一般人不以利害相權、於水災委員會所築斡堤之外、又增築小堤、洞庭鄱陽之間、圩堤如綱、化滄海爲桑田、水無相當之去路、而欲其不肇禍　矣、</p>

<h3>反對呢還是服從</h3>
<p>－南京馬君來信－</p>
<p>我現在有件很難的問題，要請先生明白的解釋和指示！事實是這樣的：其實我雖是年巳弱冠，但巳輟學，對於自巳的立身處世，可以說還是茫無把握年，那有餘力來談訂婚·但是，我那想盡了生兒子。娶媳婦的責任父母，巳竭力的爲我訂婚，强我就範。使我陷子煩惱，躊躇，難以自决的境地，要請先生費神指敎！</p>
<p>先生，我家是個十足舊式的家庭，生我的母親當我呱呱堕地四十五天的時候，京棄我而長逝了。現在這位母親，是我父親後娶的繼母，因爲生育敎養少有關係，所以彼此都相處得很客氣·我父親是個經商者，我們父子　的感情，也處得極奸！現在我的父親和我的繼母，要把我訂婚了，對方是箇曾經受過小學敎育，但己輟學了七年之久的二十歲的小姐，她的家庭，　　同我的家庭一般的舊式，她的父親也是個商界的鉅子，不幸在去年二月間死了！她是我這輟母的内侄婦的阿姐，我的繼母很有幾分愛她，很希望我能和她訂婚，我的父親爲可以親密我母子的情感計，他也很希望這段姻緣，能成事實。但是先生，我和這女士雖云同響，然而咫尺天涯，素少見面。她的性情，她的一切，都無從知道，批評。不過先生，我對於婚姻問題，是主張：（一）具備普通的學識，換句話說，就是須要受過中等敎育·（二）有獨立生活的技能和意志，（三）有一年以上友誼的關係，得以彼此　識個性。現在我父親們所進行的，當然與私衷相違。照理就該爽脆的拒絕反對。然而先生我是一個意志薄弱，而又多所顧慮的人，我旣不能離開家庭，那末，自然應留意於家庭的安全。倘或因爲我反對這件事之後，我和父母的感情，隨以决裂，甚或我的父親和母親間，也因之隔膜起來了·安全的家庭，給我掀起波濤，這將怎麽辦？這責任有誰來負担呢？如其說爲家庭，勉予將就。則我終身的幸福，豈不是就因之以犧牲了嗎？先生：何取何從·請你具體的指示，引導！</p>
<p>答：我們對於婚姻問題的意見，巳屢見前報，足下當巳見及。來信所云，自是普遍的現象。你若自甘爲「一個意志薄弱的人」，那就俯首聽命，將來尊府祠當的門前，給足豎起一個「孝子坊」，上面寫道：「宗子傑爲徇其父母之情而犧牲其終身的幸福，純孝也！」猗歟休哉！！然而·假使你不願吃這種來世的不可知的冷豬頭，那你就要另轉一個方向－做人！做社會的一個人·乾脆地拒絕這種「越俎代庖」的婚約，此乃斷送了一身的性生活的自由行動的主權！</p>

<h3>黃氏講詞略謂、今夏連日陰雨、報載</h3>
<p>各地水災危在旦夕、想關懐國事者、必同深憂慼也、水災之生、原係不知利用科學方法去治理、不知早爲預防、而任其成爲莫大禍患、畢棠生之升學、卽爲將來人社會之基礎、早日奠定始基、結果必良佳、所以吾於今日要講怎樣去受職業敎育」亦卽此也、此問題、可分三點說、㈠定計要早讀書之目的、無非進社會服務故於最初所進學校、最好入職業學校、免致日後感受一無所長而致有失業之痛苦、㈡目標要正確、不管職業之高下、祇要顧到我的職業、合於社會需要、有利於大衆者、雖裁　糞夫無所謂低卑可恥、蓋此種職業、實有重於總統與司令也、㈢志向要堅定、我所欲學之科、切勿輕易改變、早學工、午學商、夕學農、弄得一事無成、故於最初所學何種科、至最後仍研究此科、將來成功、必無可限量也、</p>
<h3>賈氏講詞賈佛如講靑年求出路的問</h3>
<p>題、先須問題自己能否吃得起苦、然後才可談到將來有快樂可享受、因爲升學及求業、非但精神上要吃苦、　體上吃苦的地方也很多、我們要避免將來吃苦、現在就得準備怎樣去受職業敎育、在没有專門本事的人、你去問他會什麽、他必定說是樣樣都會、可是做起事來樣樣都不會的、有了這種人、正是社會混亂的大原因、所以我們靑年所受的敎育頂好是受職業敎育、學專門本事、在社會上是决不會受淘汰的、現在南京蘇州兩地的職業學校、本屆畢業生、共計有五百餘人之多、因爲社會的需要、這許多人没有一個失業的、可見受過職業敎育的人、决不會被社會擯棄云云、</p>
<h3>江氏演講略分四點、（一）何以要受</h3>
<p>職業敎育、㈠個人環境、㈡個人的聰明能力、㈢個人的志願、㈡怎樣受職　敎育、㈠認定個人的個性和能力、㈡認定科目不要輕易變更、㈢不慕虚榮、㈣做學並重卽手並用、㈤考察社會職業的狀况、㈥注意身心修養、（甲）勤勞、（乙）節儉、（丙）刻苦犧牲、（以上三種是對巳的、）㈠有禮貎、㈡利羣、㈢愛人愛物、（以上三種是對人的、）㈢職業敎育的效用何在、㈠職業平等、㈡勞而後食、㈢手腦並用、㈣什麽是職業敎育、㈠廣義的凡一切職業要經敎育薰陶的、㈡狹義的就是農工商等、㈢家政這是對女子而言的云、</p>
<h3>楊氏演講略分三點、㈠爲什麽要受</h3>
<p>職業敎育、我們的受職業敎育之目的、因爲預備將來謀自己的生活爲社會去服務、㈡我們怎樣去受職業敎育、一·調查該學校的科目與自己興趣、是否相同、二·要内容充實不尙虚張外表的學校、三·有可以信仰的敎師、四·校風和校譽都好的、五·開辦至少在一學期以上的、六·明白他們的内容、並非在形式或　榮所引誘的七·學校内的主要科、確合我的身心的、八·學校的費用爲家庭所能負担的㈢我們要職業敎育、要有六種德行、一·肯耐苦·四·始終如一、三·忠實從事、四·意志堅强、五能守規律、六·眼光要遠大云云、</p>
<p>聞今日爲中學日、上午九時有陶百川倪文亞二君演講、下午三時半有鄭止谷·陳彬龢·李宗文三君演講、各學校學生祇須帶校章、均可到塲聽講云、</p>

<p>焚書的祖師，誰都知道是棄始皇：其實，他的祖先巳燔過詩書，始皇的焚書，只算是繼承祖先的遺訓，並非他的創作。韓非子和氏籌說：「商君敎秦孝公以連什伍設告坐之過，燔詩書而明法令。」可見焚書始於秦孝公，今人不駡孝公，獨駡秦始皇，只怕不是天公地道的話吧。</p>
<p>秦孝公棄始皇的政策現在流傳到外國去了。德國學生爲着保護日耳曼的婦女而大焚性書，雖博得一般人稱快，但，也有許多人反對，以爲不應該把性</p>
<p>書常做洪水猛獸看，越是焚燬性書，越是替性書擴大宣傳，只怕結果適得其反呢。</p>
<p>德國焚燬性書以後，「一不做，二不休」，又大舉淸除共產主義書籍，警察</p>
<p>搜獲的禁書，己有五百噸之多，付之一炬，赤化了赤化的學說；究竟書的赤化，比不上火的赤化，結果，只製造了一大堆紙灰。</p>
<p>善學　秦的莫如德國，善學德國的又莫如日本；日人藤岡津吉氏，辦理左翼出版物，有廿五年的悠久歷史，近忽聲明轉入右翼，而將所有的左翼書籍悉數在日比谷公園的廣塲上當衆焚化。卻不料二千數百年的暴秦政策，會得盛行於歐亞兩强國，這倒車開得眞不可思議啊！</p>
<p>秦孝公在宴冥中點首這：「寡人之道，西行於德矣。「秦始皇也在宴宴中抵掌道：「朕之道，東行於日本矣。」</p>
<p>去了，男的年靑的着西裝，年長些的穿長袍子，女的却一律的都是頂時髦的夏股，短袖子，露出兩條白臂膊，高跟鞋托托的走出去，他們各人找各人的樂園去，只留下着，些孩子們在家扮主子，每當這時我没有了工作，正想靜下心來看些書或是寫點文章的時候，那留下着的這　小鴨子便起勁的鼓噪着，他們跳的跳，呌的呌，有時候扮演戲劇，歇下小丫頭梅香的脖子大家當馬騎，有時候「自相殘殺」，大的欺小的！於是小的哭，大的笑，而我却在隔壁只有把兩手掩住了自己的耳朶，閉上了眼默默的祈禱着上帝賜給我片刻的寗靜。</p>
<p>爲着一天的勞乏，到夜便想早點睡，每次纔合上眼，却又立刻給隔壁熙熙攘攘的熱閙聲音驚醒，過來，原來那些大人們一個個都從樂園回來了，而且他們還帶了許多外界的天使，一時裏鶯聲燕語，巧笑嬌啼，雜杳的波蕩，進我整個小樓的空間，使我再也不能睡熱。我索性睜大了眼，平心靜氣的去領受那芳鄰賜給我的夜之音樂：我聽見這一邊是在開着留聲機，男的吹口琴，女的似乎在歌舞着；那一邊却「碰，二十六，五十二，一百零四和····」淸脆的打牌聲，丨這樣的每夜我都得等那芳鄰的音樂停止了的時候，午夜的兩點鐘左右，我纔被赦似的睡去。</p>
<p>今天是星期日，很例外的，我的芳鄰一淸早例雇了幾條船，全家（自然連一隻小鴨子也不剩着的，）出發去，旅行ＸＸ山了，趁着這上帝賜給我的唯一寗靜的一天，我寫下了這一篇我的芳鄰的禮讚，我祝福着我的芳鄰此刻在途中平安！</p>
<h3>芳鄰禮讚</h3>
<p>— 嗣子</p>
<p>命運騙使着我住進到這間鴿子籠式的小閣樓裏，隔一層板壁就住着我們的上司ＸＸ先生的家屬，ＸＸ先生是寗波人　，自然他的家屬大大小小全說寗波話，那一羣鴨子呌似的「咱拉丨咱拉！」的聲音整天的在我的耳膜裏激動着，我就像住在一個放鴨池邊過日子。因爲一大早就有工作，除了星期日，　　　天我起身得都很早：自然我的芳鄰不　會跟我一樣有早市，那大大小小的一羣鴨子全還甜睡着，到我在辦公室裏工作了數小時，傍午回到自巳的寓籠裏，我的芳鄰開始了他們一天的早操，這早操不是上野外去行深呼吸，打八叚錦，却是每個人睡飽了睜大着眼睛躺在床上吊嗓子，男的唱「楊延輝····「唱「蓮英托夢「，女的却唱「毛毛雨，唱「孟姜女尋夫「，··早操畢，纔一個個起身來呌「王媽打水』，「李媽倒茶」，到我吃午飯的時候，他們纔進早餐，不丨應該是說一天的第一餐，因爲以後他們不知還得吃好多餐，分不出早·午·夜的。</p>
<p>吃罷飯，那些大人們便一個個的溜出</p>
<h3>我愛我夫會</h3>
<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>且休落拓貪杯酒，更莫猖狂愛吟詩！今朝捉將官裏去，這回斷送老頭皮。···這是宋人楊朴妻子做的勸夫詩。原來宋眞宗曉得楊朴是位隱士，呌他出來做官，問楊朴道：你出來時候，有人做詩送你嗎？楊朴微笑答道：别人</p>
<p>倒没有，只有老妻送我一首，便把上首詩念了出來。眞宗知道他不願意做官，仍放他到山林做隱士去了。我從前見了這個故事，和唐人所做「悔敎夫壻覓封候「的詩，以爲古時代的女子心理，和目下大大不同。現下女人的心理，誰不</p>
<p>願嫁給達官貴人，自巳來享太太，奶奶的福，無須顧到做官的有傷陰功積德，並且也蹈了多少危機，這難道可說是眞眞「愛夫」嗎？</p>
<p>現下女人的心理，没有不望丈夫發起財來，自巳便可以安享虚榮的幸福。有的，家庭巳足温飽，安安穩　可以過日子：却不知道「知足不辱」「知止不殆」的道理，旣不勸誡丈夫，不要去幹不道德的事，絕了貪多務得的心：還因爲自巳的摩登浪費，弄得丈夫走入魔道，殺身，敗德，破家·····這等事也往往有起於女人的；這難道可說是眞眞「愛夫」嗎？</p>
<p>善哉！善哉！外國人發起「我愛我夫會」來了。這眞是一個福音，値得我們提倡的。加州訊：普恩台地方，有人發起組織「我愛我夫會」，提倡妻對丈夫的「人道待遇」。該會並不開會，也不收費</p>
<p>，凡入會的女子，祗須盡一種義務，便是實際敬愛伊的丈夫：否則便不合會員的資格。自這會成立以後，一般久受獅威的丈夫，一時都呈趾高氣揚之槪。有一丈夫對人道：『這個會是從偉大的理想的產生，我們有「母親節」「父親節」，可是天天作若役的可憐丈夫，反被丢在腦後，也不是一天啊』！畢竟美國人有</p>
<p>些英國人血統關繋，思想没有像法，俄的新：所以從前他們的大小說家華盛頓歐文，在「附掌錄」裏做篙「李迫入夢」，再做篇「耐寒花傳」·一是譏諷男人要脫離悍婦覊絆，只有逃世的一法。一是描寫夫妻間的伉儷情篤，來做世人的榜男人因爲鎭日價坐在家裏，恐怕在愛情上發生裂痕，想出一個妙法來，便是早上出去，晚上回來，裝做没有失業一般，來維持夫妻間的愛情。唉！美國這種去婦間的情形，那裏知道我們貴國人，也傳染來了。做男人的，大多數　着和女性結合的不易，戀愛代價的偉大，戀愛滋味的辛辣。一般摩登女子，誰願發起「我愛我夫會」，來剝奪自己無上的「妻權「呢！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>積之笑道：高就没有，低就難道也没有嗎？說畢，呵呵一笑。趙自强還不曾領悟到他的意思，便道：甘先生現時在什麽機關就職呢。積之道：不瞞您說，我之道：不瞞您說，我想投到鐵路上去當一名小工。現時長衣服没有脫下來，脫不來，脫下來，我就這樣幹了。趙連長，你不要以爲我是開玩笑的，這是眞話。我覺得一個人要憑自巳的本領去找飯吃，無論幹什麽，精神上都是痛快的。反過來說，倚靠别人做事，就混到了簡任職特任職的大官，或者千百萬銀子大財，精神上還有一種痛苦。在海甸，不是人家呌我二老爺嗎？這就表示着，我不過是老爺的一個副字號，没有了老爺就没有了我。趙連長笑道：甘先生太謙遜了，跟着在兄長機關裏做事，這也算不得一種依賴，只看自己有没有這個才具，你不到令兄機關裏就事，他一樣的要找别人。再說一名老實話，現在作官，要什麽眞才實學，假如我有一萬桿槍，我就有做省長的希望，决不能說令兄機關裏的事，你幹不下來。積之道：趙連長，你倒是個痛快的人。不過，淸官難斷家務事，我丢了老爺不幹到城裏來住會館，當然有我的苦衷。趙連長聽他這一番話他的行動，竟是與老姑娘絲毫無干。想了一想，微笑道：海甸的人，都說你升了官呢，那知道您有一番苦衷搬出來的？積之笑道：那楊家老太太，以爲我也升了官吧？趙自强道：倒是不曾提到。積之笑道：做老爺我是不想做了，不過我一定要自己去找一條出路出來，然後再回到海甸去，也讓海甸人看看，我並不是除了依賴兄長，就不能吃飯的。趙連長，你今天來看我，我是很感激，倘若你遇到了海甸的人談起我來，請您不必把我的情况，告訴了他們。趙自强躊躇了一會子，你决定了去作小工嗎？甘積之笑道：恐怕是不免走上這一條路。（一○八）</p>

<p>淸萬紅友有紅豆詞：誰喚小梅，僭紅兒名色。與琦仲之討有異曲同工之妙。</p>
<p>唐代宗時，日林國獻紅豆，大而有光，名詰多珠。</p>
<p>淸汪碧巢，亦有紅豆詩；冰潔花叢艷小連，紅心一縷更嫣然。</p>
<p>明屈大均木語：豆大　色，山村兒女或以飾首，宛如珠　，收之二三年不壞，今亦有人鑲成約指或别針，以爲飾品，而西方婦女，尤喜此物，以供玩賞。</p>
<p>維揚吳園茨有詞云：把洒祝東風，種出雙紅豆。梁溪顧氏女，見而悅之，日夕諷詠，四壁皆書二語，時因目園茨爲紅豆詞人，亦紅豆之佳話也。</p>
<p>徐興公谓嶺南園中，有相思木，歲久結子，色紅如大豆，故名。相思子每一樹結子數斛，非卽紅豆也。</p>
<p>同邑東方病夫曾孟樸，在眞美善雜，有柳如是一則，關於紅豆山莊事甚詳，「牧　在白茆紅豆村，又築了紅豆山莊，那時如是所生的女兒，巳長大嫁婿，伊和婿女，居留紅豆村。」　　北平侯疑始，自題雙紅豆館主，文章詩詞，卓著海内，一名記者也。一說雙紅豆館主，是袁二寒雲之别署，不論其是疑始，是寒雲，能題此名，人定不俗，余聞友人言，北平侗厚齋，名紅豆館主，善皮黃，粉墨登塲，儼然老伶工，觀者嘖嘖稱之。</p>
<p>余曾郵贈瘦鵑紅豆雙顆，而惠我拙著封侯夢之題字悔敎夫婿，以豆易字，一如以鵝易字，亦文壇中韻事也。</p>
<p>前紅玟瑰編者趙苕狂，亦嗜紅豆，余曾付郵寄之，後得其來書云；「驛卒中亦有雅人，巳於中途竊取其一而去，倘使瘦鵑寒雲輩聞之，不知又將作何感想耳？一笑。」在昔竊人字　者，謂之雅賊，而驛卒所爲，亦不失爲雅也。霍桑探案作者，老友程小靑，素不喜以毛筆寫字，余曾以紅豆雙粒，索其近著海角茄聲題字，以可歌可泣相贈，附以便箋，寥寥　語，有六朝人小品風味。</p>
<p>天虚我生陳蜨仙，咏紅豆調寄紅情云：筵前記曲，愛柔美素手，拈來盈掬，比櫻唇一樣臙脂潤紅玉，别後相思多少，勞寄與美人南國，敢認做鵑血，凝冰顏色鬥蛾綠。叮囑且籠燭，怕看煞絲珠，惹伊羞縮，量成十斛，飼與鸚哥料無福，若恐珊瑚漏除，用取情絲穿束，總不抵骰子上嵌來入骨。名家手筆，不同凡響。奉賢遯叟朱家駒，有謝常熟虞社錢南鐵紅豆詩兩絕：生從南國最相思，難得相思拜竉貽，擬報瓊瑤愁未稱，沈吟愧賦木瓜詩。一榻琴書委敝廬，山房没字欲何如，從今題作雙紅豆，比似三槐韻有餘。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>大減價</h3>
<p>— 珠</p>
<p>法國小說家左拉的「羅貢馬惹說薈」中有一部描寫百貨商店的，呌做「太太們的樂園。」資本雄厚的大百貨商店如何壓迫那些小商店，小商店的頑强抵抗，如何終於失敗：是這小說的主要題材。所謂「太太們的樂園」就是書中那百貨商店的牌號。</p>
<p>左拉描寫那百貨公司經理的戰略是「薄利多賣，」而號召顧客的手段就是「大减價。」百貨公司爲要撃破某一對手時，眞能夠「减價」的。牠的資本雄厚，牠的宣傳廣闊，小商店自然不是牠的敵手，只有破產。</p>
<p>自從上海有了百貨公司後，每逢他們大減價的時候，我就替那些小商店揑一把汗。然而事有例外，十年前第一家百貨公司出現於南京路時，雖則聽得小商店的老　縐著眉頭說「生意走完了，」可是到現在好像他們依然還能掙扎。並且自從百貨商店首創了「大減價」後，小商店也就學樣，有些舗子簡直是一年到頭在「大减價，」天天是布旗飛揚，軍樂隊奏著「十八摸」之類的小曲。今年爲的市面不景氣，每條馬路上天天有大减價的旗幟和樂隊；看的人很多</p>
<p>，買的人很少。就是幾家大百貨公司也比往年來幾回大減價。進去一看，眞熱鬧，特别是綢緞布疋部擠得厲害。於此可見大公司的號召力畢竟不凡。看著那些高堆的疋頭，擠擁不開的顧客，臉紅流汗的店員，叮叮叮不斷的呌鈴響，</p>
<p>我就想到了左拉所寫的大減價時作戰似的氣分，我又恍惚聽得同一馬路上也在大減價中的小商店樓上的蹩脚軍樂隊奏著「十八摸」，愈奏愈顯得冷落悲哀。</p>
<p>在不景氣的現在，小商店的掙扎更加困難；左拉所寫的那些現象，也許終於要在我們這裏出現罷？不，過同是大資本壓倒小資本，意義却又各别；我們這裏所演奏的，不是繁榮的向上發展，而是向下的僅能自保，整個市面在衰落著！</p>
<h3>天災歟？人禍歟？</h3>
<p>— 鐵生</p>
<p>長江江水，日來又見大漲，尤其在武漢一帶，來勢兇猛，假若再繼續漲下去，則再來一次嚴重的水災，自然是意中事。</p>
<p>查前年大水災的時候，受難者五千餘萬人，損失不知凡幾，至今思之，仍令人心悸。然而前次大水災之所以形成，是由於人們之致力于戰爭，無暇顧及水利，砍伐森林，動用堤欵，以致各地牛山濯濯，各工程局都囊空如洗，所以天雨一來，則一齊入江，堤岸腐朽，一衝即潰，而空前的水災，使出現了。前次的水，與其說是天災，毌寗說是人禍！經過了一次大災之後，當然人們也就乖些。于是什麽導淮入海，什麽護堤委員，名目繁多，經費也境撥不少。但是『祇聞樓梯響，不見人下來』。機關固然是多。洽水却未見有何成績，申報十九日漢口專電謂（『···一碼頭猪巷，十九日巳進水，武昌武泰閘亦漏水，形勢嚴重』『···張家基等十九由沙市視察返漢，據談：上游堤工尙好，其有欠缺者，巳令星夜趕修···』由此，一方面可以看出他們的成績，是祗不過水來閘漏：别方面則又可以看出禍到臨頭，他們才來着慌丨</p>
<p>此外，由下面的一段新聞，我們又可看出他們之動用堤欵，并不亞于從前，申報十九日漢口電爲謂『全國經濟會以鄂各機關借用堤欵二百三四十萬，巳分函催償，以利堤工。』在這個情形之下，那能阻住洶湧的江潮？長江一帶的居民，又那有不變爲魚　的道理？</p>
<h3>海</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>少時候我愛海，現在也還没有改變。老家是座落在東海之濱，雖然離岸還得一二十里路，但我曾去閒逛過。那兒没有高大的山，没有葱鬱的森林，有的只是一片白　茫茫的海。</p>
<p>潮落的時候，也常到海灘上去捉螃蜞，拾螺螄：晚上就宿在近海的親戚家，聽風括著海潮怒嘯。這當兒我是　黑而健康，小小的年紀，就這麽走上幾十里路滿不在乎。</p>
<p>我們全村子多是務農的。我也愛耕，愛牧，愛緣的田野藍的天；可是，我的父親偏不願我幹這勾當。</p>
<p>我分别了這個海，又到别的海濱流蕩着。海水也許還是同樣的味兒，也許不　一樣，我可不大淸楚。但當受了委屈或心頭不高興的當兒，我還得跑到海邊去，高高的長嘯幾聲。</p>
<p>海，牠給我安慰，告訴我甚麽是偉大。在淸晨，地球剛從黑夜裏蘇醒過來的時候，碧澄澄的不波微漾着，海面罩着淡淡的霧氣，漁帆在迷濛中開始出現：隨後太陽上來了，海波閃爍出黃色的，藍色的，紫色的花紋。</p>
<p>但這可不曾支持多久，近海的天氣恁地難以捉摸，一會兒天空給黑雲掩住，狂風毫無遮攔的括起來，從閃電的雲端裏，下來一陣踐踏似的暴雨；天昏地暗，波濤是如臨大敵似的呐喊，高掀時彷彿像要從水面飛去，白浪到處奔騰著；大自然像瘋了一樣。但接着天空重又開霽，依舊是靜穆的微漾的一片。</p>
<p>我也曾在暮色蒼茫中登臨過面海的懸崖，聽鸛鷗的長嗚，四顧無人，下囑洪荒，感學到天地的悠久和人生的奄忽，不禁流下幾點感傷的眼淚。</p>
<p>在這短短的幾年裏，我各處流蕩着，到南又到北，我遇見同樣的海，同樣的晴和雨，同樣的幽靜和雄偉，但從不曾再遇見我那　黑而健康的童年。</p>
<h3>棉被</h3>
<p>— 伍</p>
<p>五天以前，託阿福爹代我去向廠裏的招工頭說妥，爲我補上一個名字。我如今巳經四處絕緣，毫無生路了。我所有的東西巳經當光：自從做生意虧空，把一些營生傢具，折還了債，每天就只靠當當來維持兩條命，到如今，己是三四個月，没有專作，不做工怎麽辦？作工我</p>
<p>知道比作生意要苦，但那是說不得的。</p>
<p>阿福爹今天來說，倘使要事體成功得快，那就非送一點人情不可。我問他：</p>
<p>「送什麽好呢」？我没有料得要有這樣一種手續，我想這不是常有的事罷？然而，阿福爹說：</p>
<p>「慣例是兩隻洋。！這是小工缺。每天工鈿三角陸。要事體好，人情也得多送。」</p>
<p>我被駭倒了。看起來，作工也是無望的。作生意要化本，賣氣力也同樣要化本。我現在拿什麽來送這　人情？</p>
<p>阿福爹看出我爲難，兩人計議的結果，是拿我床上僅有的一床棉被，暫時當掉。他說：「要是補得上工，是可以購回來的。到那時再贖轉來。」</p>
<p>我困惑地走進房去，老婆正躺在床上，面孔朝襄，她爲我賺不來錢，常常偷偷的哭。每到我没有米，拿東西去當，她總要哭一回，起先是不肯，後來没法，含着涙，兩眼陰慘慘的一面把東西交給我，一面說，「什麽時候啊？東西快當光了。」我說，「有了錢，總得贖回來的。」可是這些東西往往是如石沉大海，我自巳也不知道什麽時候可以把牠再拿回來。</p>
<p>我在床前躊踷了一下，我想我應當怎樣從她身上把棉被扯下來呢。我的心有些黯然，手拾不起來。</p>
<p>「你起來一下罷？」我說，一讓我拿被。我找了工了」。</p>
<p>「找了工拿被幹嗎？她似乎有些覺得，身體蜷動了一下，被也似乎捲紥得更緊。</p>
<p>「要先開消招工頭哩。阿福爹說。」　　「又要當。天還這麽冷，當了被蓋什麽？我不當」。她的鼻頭有些滯塞，聲音從鼻孔中發出來。</p>
<p>「找了工，回頭兩三天就可以贖的。你起來罷」？我在她身後等了兩分鐘没有動靜，我只好挨着她坐下，舉起這千斤的手擱在她的肩上。就好像一四顫抖的貓，她立時在我的手下抖動起來，埋在被中大哭。·····</p>
<p>我在惶愧焦煩中沉默了很久，我不知道我應當用什麽話去安慰她。我只覺得我把她拖着，向一個無底的泥潭中沉下去，我一面無限的痛苦，我不應該拉着她同歸於盡，然而一面却無法挽救。我從她手中當去一件東西，我覺得我和她向泥潭中沉下一次。我不知道這泥潭的深度，我也不知道我們下沉的止境。生活是如何沉重啊，世界是如何昏黑啊？</p>
<p>她的咽喉給什麽堵塞了，大聲咳吐起來我扶住她的頭移到床邊，我覺得我的眉頭　得發痛。她咳吐了一陣，沙着聲音說：</p>
<p>「你把被當了，我蓋什麽？你難道不知道我生着病的？你難道不知道我肚中是懐着小東西的？··」她說一句，就像鐵錘似的，重重的在我的心上撃一下。我看着裏在她身止的棉被發　，我不知道今天將怎樣結局。</p>
<p>「你找了工是可靠的嗎？」停了一會，她說。　　「阿福爹說，送了人情，補一個小工是有的。」我不能自信，但我以爲阿福爹的話是唯一的倚靠。除開這一條路我還有什麽路可走呢？</p>
<p>我不敢想像那是不可靠的。</p>
<p>「好罷」。她一面堅决的扯着身上的被，一面喘息着道：「你拿去罷，讓我凍死好了，你讓我凍死好了」。她立刻從被中跳出來了。她看見我坐着不動，她拿着被塞在我的胸前道：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽不拿呢？他不是在外面等嗎？···</p>
<p>啊！」她說着背轉身倒下嗚咽起來。</p>
<p>我不知道如何是好，我把棉被重復覆在她身上，替她蓋好，但她把牠推開，抓取床頭的衣，披在身上，立起身向外面走，口中喃喃的說，「你走啊，你走！」</p>
<p>我在房中沈思了一下，把棉被捲起來，挾在脅下。走出了大門，我覺得頭腦昏惘，沉重得利害，我不知道這棉被幾時纔可以贖回來。</p>
<h3>紅蘿舊鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪｕｌｅｓＫｅａｒｏ作林取譯</p>
<p>個人的思想（續）</p>
<p>「可是我們總當說些話混過時候啦，」紅蘿蔔鬚說，他己經有幾分不安了。</p>
<p>「你閉着嘴不響還好些呢，」雷辟克說，他手上拿着一枝蠟燭。他走開了。大哥菲利克斯跟在他後面。</p>
<p>「希望你睡得快樂啦，老朋友！」他對紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>隨後姐姐愛勒絲丁站起身，嚴肅地說道：</p>
<p>「晚安，親愛的朋友！」</p>
<p>留下紅蘿蔔鬚一人，徬徨無揞。</p>
<p>昨天，雷辟克先生還告訴他要怎樣思考：</p>
<p>「「人家」（ｏｎ）是指誰？』雷辟克對他說。『「人家」是不存在的。說大家，那便空空的没有指着一個人。你太會背誦你聽來的話了。試由自巳想想看罷。　現個人的思想，開始祗要有着一個就行了。」</p>
<p>他昌險嘗試的第一個就没有受到歡迎，紅蘿蔔鬚用灰把火蓋好，把椅子靠牆排着，看了一看鐘，然後回到他的臥房去了。他這房間囊有着通往一個地　去的扶梯，所以人家呌做地　房。這是一間在夏天使人覺得陰凉可愛的房間，獵獲物可以放在這囊一星期；還不會腐爛。最近一次打死的一隻野兎，放在一隻碟子裏，鼻孔囊流着血。那囊還放着一些籘，滿滿的盛　鷄的穀料，紅蘿蔔鬚常是歡　把　條赤裸的手　插在那裏面攪着頑。</p>
<p>那些用衣架掛着放在那間房衷的一家人的衣裳，平常是使他不安的。這正像一些自殺的人</p>
<p>先把靴子脫下整齊齊地排在木板上面，然後跑去縊死了的一樣。　　可是今晚紅蘿蔔鬚不害怕了。他没有向床底望一眼。月亮，陰影，花園囊那像是特意掘下給人由窗口投下去的井，那不使他害怕。</p>
<p>他如果想到害怕，他便會害怕的，可是他現在没有想到那事上面去。穿着一襯衫，他忘記祗應當用脚踵在地上走着，以便不至十分感到紅磚的寒冷。</p>
<p>睡在床上，他瞧着那些潤濕的石　製的瓶子，繼續開展他個人的思想，其所以呌做個人思想者，因爲這是祇應當自巳想着而不必告訴人的。</p>
<p>樹葉的暴風雨</p>
<p>多時以來，躭於夢想的紅蘿蔔鬚便在注視着那大白楊樹上最高的一片樹葉。</p>
<p>他空想着，等着它動。</p>
<p>它好像和樹分開了，獨個兒，毫無　繋的，自由在的，另外生活着。</p>
<p>每天，它從早到晚，都在睡着一樣。</p>
<p>從正午起，它便死了似的呆在那兒，它不像樹葉，而像是天空的一個污點，當紅蘿蔔鬚等得不耐煩了，非常不舒服，但就在這時，它終於動了一動。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談穿衣</h3>
<p>穿衣，幾乎和吃飯吃而没有衣穿，固然巳經不能算是「完人」，而旣無飯吃復無衣穿者，其見笑於紳士太太之流，宜也！</p>
<p>和吃飯完全一樣，他們决不是有衣不會穿，而是别人有衣穿，他們却無衣可穿。所以織布工人和成衣匠又何常不是終歲徒勞？</p>
<p>記得有一時期，我縣　突然來了一位將軍而兼縣長的行政長官。這位英雄眞是英明得很，他在勵精圖治的精神之下，忽然覺得了無衣可穿的人們，不僅是於衛生有碍，而且有損觀瞻。於是立刻下了一紙通令：「禁止鄉人赤　入城」。其後在縣衙門口豎起兩根木椿，凡違令者均綁在刑椿上，罰他給太陽曝晒終日。有的禁不起如此毒刑者，便活活晒暈在暴日之下。可是後來還是他的屬員肯出注意，改曝晒爲罰欵五元。於是公差下鄉四出搜尋，當然這筆收放很可以增加政費不少。於是這位父母官也就名利雙收。據老鄉來談，他臨走的時候，紳士們還給他樹了一塊「去思碑一哩。然而這是國民革命巳成功後的事情，値得記載。</p>
<p>話雖如此，可是也有許多先生們對於無衣可穿的人們也肯盡力打算。譬如上海某公廠的經理，每當工人入廠便發一套藍布工衣。服裝統一，以壯觀瞻。不過是到月底在全部工資五元中扣除四元罷了。這樣一來，廠方亦大有好處。「狗咬破衣裳」，乃是顯而易見的事實。狗旣如此，何况人乎？於是襤不堪者擠入了由二等改成三等的電車中，且將屁服上的油漬在别人的白紡長衫上揩了一下，少不了要被人噴沬大駡：「猪玀！爲什麽不坐到拖車上去呢？」至於</p>
<p>這等人假如定要少吃兩個大餅而闖到頭等人中去，當然更是不成體統，何况規</p>
<p>則上早巳註明：衣履破舊者不准入内。</p>
<p>如此看來，穿衣眞是要緊。所以有許多穿着白紡褲褂穿起袖管的白相朋友，雖然不見得每餐都有飯吃，可是衣裳却不可麻胡。</p>
<p>至於太太着旗袍，老爺穿西裝，都是爲了適合身份。不過中國人總應當穿中國衣裳。例如楊杏佛先生因爲生平愛好騎馬，不幸便穿着馬褲而不明不白的死於靑天白日之下，但是文人而殮以騎馬之武裝，究竟不大堂皇·於是在入殮的時候一定要長袍馬褂而後可。</p>

<p>從這許多的錯雜消息裏，久巳掀起了我們的不能		抑制的疑慮·當事者告訴我們，這是中山先生的遺意，國家頒行的大政，期在促進敎學效率，銓敍眞才，提高文化，堂而皇之，彷彿這就是診斷吾國敎育的唯一妙竅，今後敎育的出路就在於此者。</p>
<p>敎育要嚴格，我們並不反對，不過所謂嚴格，似不應專注於考試一端，尤不應專注於形式上之會考；而在於敎育行政與敎育方針之嚴格；也不僅限於學生一方面，敎育當局尤應嚴格才對。</p>
<p>敎學效率如何，是取决於敎育制度，學校當局，尤取决於社會環境，决不取决於開科取士式的會考。如果說會考可以檢查學生成績，那麽，平日學校舉行的考試，就不足檢查麽，會考範圍是試騐全部學程，如中學會考，就要試中學階段的六年學科，因爲這樣，便有許多學生感於無從預備，也就根本不去預備，這樣，是否能促進敎學效率？</p>
<p>其次談到銓敍　才，反正早己成了一句不能兌現的口號，自考試院而各省各地舉行的部分考試，巳經有過不少，結果如何我們祇在報上見過考試得中人員，幾次向主考當局大興問事之師。事實告訴我們，現社會並不需要眞才，一切需要眞才的塲所，早巳被一般有勢力的人們牢牢地覇住了，誰也没有插足的可能·在這裏只要會吹會拍，並不需要眞才。</p>
<p>再次談到提高文化，那更使我們不勝疑恚，整個敎育旣無確定方針丨這人上台採用美國式敎育，那人又搬販西歐		敎育，日本敎育，甚至各省不同，各自爲政，五花八門，目爲之炫，以學校爲營私地域，以學生爲試騐品，更有帝國主義敎育丨敎會敎育混雜其間，充斥全國各地·平日的敎育旣巳成了這麽一個空　，而欲藉一朝之會考，以提高文化，不　但目的不能達到，恐更引動學生加倍　的僥倖心，虚榮慾，而更使文化低降。</p>
<p>話雖是這麽說，但會考畢竟是在各省各地轟轟烈烈的舉行了，文化經濟總匯的本市，也己於前日舉行過了。在此我們原來希望全市學生均等的挨幾個鐘頭的苦，均等接受嚴格，但不幸得很，「會考糾紛」「舞弊」轟傳了我們的耳鼓，考塲裏尤其閙得天翻地覆，原因當然是舞弊，更可想見問題的嚴重了。</p>
<p>中國的敎育南　　，會考而至此，我們老百姓還有什麽話好說？只有揑把鼻子長　　　　。</p>
<h3>帝國女兒的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>天空中飄着雨絲，那高大的鐘樓像鬼怪一樣的劃破陰沉的天空。這平時熱閙的馬路，僅有幾輛人力車停在舞塲的門口。他們聳着肩，埋着頭，冀希獲得他們的主顧，解决明天的生活。年虹燈在雨絲中也失了光芒，舞場中的音樂鬼呌似的飄蕩出來，使人感覺一陣陣的寒慄。櫻子張着失眠的眠珠，望見鐘樓上的電光針己相差五分鐘就十二點了。她疲乏地敷上白粉，搽上紅脂，預備出賣她的靈魂。無力地踏出那鴿籠，雨絲迎面吹來，她淸醒了她要裝着笑臉，才能騙取人們的錢財。於是她一溜烟似的跑進那家下等跳舞塲。</p>
<p>跳舞塲裏僅寥寥的幾個顧客，白俄老班倚在櫃台旁，像隻睡着的猪。他見櫻子小烏一般而跳進來，他魔術家似的巳換上笑臉。</p>
<p>「櫻子姑娘，下雨哩···噢，請這邊來坐。」他謙卑地把椅子凑上櫻子的屁股</p>
<p>這家舞塲，平時有六七個没落了靈魂的三烏姑娘。他們的主顧，除了水手外，專靠外等工人。他們在這一帶没有發洩性慾的所在。那從前公爵出身的貴族白俄，就放棄油膩肥皂的職業，經營這舞塲。下了幾天雨，那幾個姑娘或者</p>
<p>在什麽地方有了主顧，再也不見來，所以今天櫻子的來，白俄分外的勤。他親自給她樽了一杯綠色的酒。迷了眼說：「櫻子姑娘，唱一個歌吧。」櫻子從椅上迅速的跳上台的中央，揮動她的兩條白的腿，唱出西班牙下流社社中的淫歌，同時手指凑向唇邊，再向座中揮送。一個灌醉了酒的白色人種，把櫻子姑娘　到自己的懐抱中，櫻子姑娘僅僅吃吃的笑，白俄快活得鼓起掌來。</p>
<p>「兩杯伏特加！」</p>
<p>白俄像一隻爬着蝸牛似的全身顫動。他知道祇要櫻子姑娘肯來，他的營業就有起色的。他送過兩杯酒後，計算着那個肯留櫻子姑娘住夜，他可彌補這三天的虧本了。</p>
<p>那個白種人自巳乾了酒，就强把强烈的飲料灌櫻子姑娘的小小櫻唇中。櫻子姑娘的腿在空中揮蕩，那雖然是掙扎的表示，一半也是欲擒姑縱的手段。白種人笑，白俄也笑，櫻子滿臉都是笑　　，因爲她知道不能哭的。</p>
<p>「兩杯伏特加」</p>
<p>天空中飄着雨絲，　鏜兩下鐘聲從高聳的建築物中送來。喝醉了酒的白　人把櫻子姑娘向地上一抛，他掏出兩塊錢，唱着一○Ｌ○的歌聲大踏步出去。幾個顧客瞧飽了把戲，也滿意的笑着歸去，白俄意外的進欵，也滿面笑容儘鞠躬表示歡送，然而櫻子姑娘哭了。</p>
<p>一家可以糊口的飲食堂，被一二八的砲火送　了，父親犧牲在太和魂的旗肉體和勾當，她想着帝國的軍閥奪得中國的東三省後，是否可以滌除大日本女兒的恥辱？她哭着拒絕了白俄的四毛錢，向飄着雨絲的街中衝去。···</p>

<h3>妨害國家信譽</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我的故鄉，紹興：當孫傳芳爲督軍的時候，曾經舉行一種國債。這時我的年紀尙小，在民國幾年巳記不淸楚了。我家裏派到三十元，村中最富的一家，他也祇不過派到二十元。若以家產相比，他起碼要在我二十倍以上。這次他們所出的錢，居然比我家少：這大槪是因爲我的父親和祖父，都是目不識丁的緣故。他們有錢且又有勢力，自然便宜許多了。當時我的祖父，經幾個所謂執事的當地劣紳威赫之後，只好忍氣呑聲地　出了。　稅乃人民應盡的義務，何况這是國債。無奈我的祖父，是没有受過敎育的人，只知有家，而不知有國的：所以自此以後，整天的在家裏鬧着，我的父親幾乎尋死，我的母親，也把所有的蠶一起丢了，我的祖父，也由此憂鬱成疾，不久竟與世長逝了。</p>
<p>先生，這使我何等的悲哀和痛恨呵！至今我的母親，還時流着涙和我說呢！在數年前，國家巳把這項欵撥還。。幾家有錢有勢的富戶，他們也領回了。我的父親，由鄰舍的通知，急去領時，不料幾個執事的劣紳，一味含糊的答覆。我的父親幾次去問，他們總是搪塞了事。現在若向法院起訴，他們都是鄉鎭公所裏的鄉長，監察委員，和調解委員。現在的章程，據說非經過調解委員的調解，是不能直接向法院起訴的。那末究有什麽方法能領回這欵呢？</p>
<p>先生是民衆的領導者·每能替人家解决一切困難的問題，我這次的要求，想也不致於拒絕。請指示我一個辦法，我正伸了頭頸盼着呢！請於這幾天内，在店員通信欄上，發表爲禱。專此祗頌撰安何佳土謹上</p>
<p>編者按：這種土豪劣紳，是最可惡不過的；一切不良的政治，以及一切萬</p>
<p>惡的製度，都建築在他們的基礎上。你想國家因爲信譽掃地·募起國債來，無人顧問，不得不出於硬派的末法。經辦</p>
<p>的人·應當如何至公至正，以期國債的信用，暫暫地確立起來。那知他們惟利是圖，旣分配不均於前，復含糊呑没於後。將見國家的信譽，被他們斷送殆盡：因而殺之，亦不足以蔽其辜也。令　令尊，因爲學識不免欠缺，所以當時並未反抗，巳經便宜了他們，讓他們消遙法外了多年。你呢！照來信看來，並不是一個完全没有智識的人了；論理膽氣也應該壯些了。你縱不爲整個國家的信舉着想，也應該認他們爲私仇，「不共戴天」地起來與他們拚一拚。至於要經過調解一層，完全是限於民事方面，及「告訴乃論」的刑事。這種「妨害國債信用」的刑事案，是可以直接告訴的。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（八）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（六）聽他還能說些什麽呢？！</p>
<p>燦爛，熱鬧，喧囂的夜之都市在今晚，却像巨獸似的躺着，在恐怖裏喘着氣，公司，銀行，店舗全都緊關着門，讓馬路上一堆堆探聽消息的人，在黑暗裏蠕動着細語着。忽然有一輛尊貴的汽車風一般的馳過。車箱裏的對話只有坐在前面的汽車夫或可隱約地聽到一二：</p>
<p>「····楊介夫嗎！我曉得的，他是頂頂大名的商紳呀！他是···」男子的聲音！有些懐疑和畏葸。</p>
<p>「是楊介夫，等一下你可以看到他，不要緊的，你只說是我的堂兄，偶然碰到的，好在我也姓李呢！」女的聲音！帶着一種新興奮的愉快的口氣。「···他還有心思來開茶舞會嗎？他的紗廠不是靠不住了嗎？」</p>
<p>「那　的話！似乎有點嘲笑男的不「門檻」，「這是第二次茶舞會呢，上一次是在趙一山公館！今天是在吳子卿家裏，一座大的洋房呢？只是大滬，大東在打仗時候不准做生意，不然更方便些！不過也不要緊，你是我的堂哥哥呢！······」聲音放得待特别低·女的說不定巳倒在男的大发腿上。接着便是沉默，在這神必的沉默裏，車夫用力在壓制自巳的肉麻想像，碍着頭皮輪轉着機盤。一直再聽到一陣叭叭的機器鎗聲，他才意識到再轉過一條馬路便是吳公館了，於是車輪緩慢下來。</p>
<p>一會兒，三姨太穿得很華麗地出現在正雲集着的客廳裏了，大家都回過頭來投射一種艷羡的眼光丨這是艷羡楊介夫的，第一個走向前來的是這裏的女主人吳太太：</p>
<p>「···來得正好，子卿說揚先生恐怕忙着不會來呢？」吳太向跟在三姨太後面走來的人一看，不是楊介夫是一個不會見過的靑年男子，她還來不及懐疑</p>
<p>，三姨太立刻轉身介紹道：</p>
<p>「眞凑巧呢，我的堂兄剛不久從日本被逼回國，來這位是吳子卿吳太太，我的堂兄就是李石喬</p>
<p>吳太太是個肥勝的中　婦人也學　社交界的男子客套，久仰，久仰的招呼了兩句就怕着去　她的　天老頭　說付麽話云了。</p>

<h3>好萊塢復興歌舞片</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>我們還記得在一九二九年時候，好萊塢各影片公受了Broadwaymelody一片的啓蒙，都傾全力於歌舞方面，羅致了許多在百老匯或别地的歌舞人才。同時詩歌的著作家，也都提着皮篋，一批一批的趕往好萊塢。但曾幾何時，好萊塢的宽氣，也像受着狂風暴雨的打撃而降低了温度。這也許要怪製片者没有努力創造的才能的。固此在所謂改變作風聲中，歌舞片就自告引退。那些遭遇厄運的著作家，也都埀頭喪氣地回他們的老家。</p>
<p>可是現在又復興了。埃第康泰的「萬花獻媚」好算輕鬆這病勢的朕兆。華納出品四十二街」４２ｎｄＳｔｔｅｅｔ猶之一帖補藥，竟把沉重的病態復原了。據說現在好萊塢各製片公司，對於歌舞片的攝製，又興奮起來了。</p>
<p>華納公司繼「四十二街」又攝了一部ＴｈｅＧｏｌｄＤｇｇｅｒｓｏｆｉ９３３ｏ由歌家亞爾喬生的妻子羅倍姬拉及琴格勞裘，華倫威廉，瓊勃郎黛兒，狄克鮑威爾等名角合演。又是一張聲色俱美的歌舞片。米高梅也在計畫從新出一部Ｈｏｌｌｙｗｏｏｅ</p>
<p>Ｒｅｖｕｅ（與一九二九年所出者大致相同）由傑克蒲爾，傑美杜倫，琪恩哈羅等合演，導演「大飯店」的愛特門戈定担任導演。還想把珍妮麥唐納在幾年前主演的ＴｈｏＭｅｒｒｙＷｉｄｏｗｓ設法重製。派拉蒙現巳攝完一部ＩｎｔｅｒｎａｔｉｏｎａＩＨｏｕｓｅ·由費爾次（Ｗ·ＣＦｉｅｌｄｓ）司都華歐文，沙麗馬立薩等合演。平克勞期佩主演的</p>
<p>ＣｏｉｉｅｇｅＨｕｍｏｒ正在攝製。雷電華也在趕製ＭｅｌｏｄｙＣｒｕｉｓｅｏ此外還開一新途徑，把捷克斯拉夫迎神賽會的風俗，演成一張别開生之面的偉大歌舞片。可愛的歐洲女明星麗琳哈蕙和約翰鮑爾斯，不久也要替福克斯公司完成一張ＭＹＬｉｐｓ</p>
<p>Ｂｅｔｒｓｙ。珍妮蓋諾和亭雷伽辣脫的Ａｄｏｒｂｌｅ也就要應時而出了。</p>
<p>擅長歌唱的姑娘們和編製詩歌的藝術家，又要交運了。有些消息靈通的巳在提着皮包，打好舗蓋，預備從ＴｉｎＰａｎＡｌｌｅｙ啓程了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「二孤女」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>假如說中國電影有了長足的進步的話，那末這是電影作家不能自驕而批評者亦當更加負起責任的時候了。有少數技術落後的影片，更値得我們嚴正的注竟。因爲這對於他們今後的改進·確有多少帮助。</p>
<p>「二孤女」的演出·在任何方面說·都不能使我們滿意。茲就故事的發展順序的指出幾點，和孤星公司諸君誠懇的商榷。</p>
<p>㈠軍法官爲什麽要親自查監？監獄的構造太理想化了。囚犯太少。但是軍法官打囚犯一塲很好。素梅探監太無緊張的表情。</p>
<p>㈡督軍調笑和威迫素梅時嫌不夠。但又文明戲化。素梅毁其雙目而全淸白，不免是傳奇小說中的資料。暴戾的督軍不會因此一怒而殃及小峯嗎？</p>
<p>㈢素梅從督軍署出來，剛好革命軍便輕便的衝殺進城，巧極。城内不見砲烟，但素梅家却無形中毁於砲火。而且素薇又立刻在敗瓦中拿出整潔的包裏來。同時破屋頽墻的佈景，假到不能再假。小峯和素梅姊妹彼此尋訪都剛好不能見面，巧極。這裏有許多戲好演，但是跑馬似的一天中都交待明白。</p>
<p>㈣某縣至陶家鎭，陶家鎭至潘家莊，都不過是數十里之遙，充其量是二天的路程，何以二孤女的衣裳都會如此破爛，甚至於赤脚挾蓆，淪爲乞丐。而且前一塲是大好的天氣，轉眼便是大雪滿地了。小縣中有寛馬路，亦屬罕見。　　　㈤素　咬指以血寫字，又是傳奇小說的夢幻。</p>
<p>㈥戰爭的塲面太假，一方面似乎還有戴了鋼盔的兵士。素薇前一塲被救，接上便是當看護太省事了。</p>
<p>㈦姊姊的未婚夫，妹　竟不認得？</p>
<p>姊姊的死訊也不必等着在風景佳妙之處才告訴姊丈。戰塲的後方醫院，竟有山</p>
<p>淸水秀的花園可供談情之用？</p>
<p>㈧素梅團圓結婚，素薇潔身引退，應於贈花之前先有伏線。</p>
<p>其他也許還有，但不必盡舉，以上各點，都屬善意討論。然而也有好的地方。如二孤女在亭中互相讓敬冷飯的時候。雪地的脚印，素薇討飯歸來跌一交等。</p>
<p>總之，我覺得本片最大的失敗便是以傳奇小說中的題材穿插舊舞臺戲的情節，加之又有文明戲的作風，導演對於Ｍｏｂｔａｇｅ的方法很少講究。畫面連續，有如連環圖畫似的。演員祇能聽着導演的口令而動作，很少表情。不必要的字幕太多。寫完本文之後，敬祝「二孤女」諸作者加緊努方。</p>
<h3>圖中秘密</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>月明公司出品</p>
<p>黃金大戲院映</p>
<p>這片故事是多麽的紊亂而複雜，全片没有抓住一個中心。牠是月明公司未改作風時（在「她的心···以前）的舊作品，劇本是蛻化於一本化戲的，所以全片也就都帶些新戲色彩，不過在編劇者的原意是有些警世的意味。例如：同爲盜匪，而十年以後，一個改邪歸正，得了很大的收穫。一個仍舊怙惡不悛，所以「捉到官裏去，」同時對於曾失足的人，處處受人挾制，甚至於妻女被淫而只能忍，表現出一個人失足的危險，露骨的描寫盜匪却是武俠片的特長。　　演出時不知道爲了什麽，總是那末紊亂，多少毫無意識的動作，天凑的巧遇，都　呌人覺得「這是在看戲」凡是困難的時候，畫面都是省去了，有時用字幕代表，多半都連字幕也没有，於是影片更覺得單調，散漫而無味了。劇中人的個性是不統一的。故事裏多半是失實的，絕非情理所許的，暴露中又有一部份矛盾的，意識又不能堅强的發展，影片的内質，就空無所有了。</p>
<h3>影計一束</h3>
<p>— 培元</p>
<p>天一公司最近將開拍于思君所編之「前進」女主角巳定黎小妹妹主演，男角色或由田方担任，該片爲一戰事題材之影片，主旨是大激發一般靑年男女們愛國，勿終沉淪在酒色的深淵中，聞導演爲裘芑香云。</p>
<p>香港大長城影片公司之新片，「還我河山」，題材是採取「九一八」與「一二八」之事變，爲一激發國人自救愛國之影片，現巳在粤公映，聞最近將運申公映。</p>
<p>天一公司各女明星自組織女子籃球隊後，隊長陳玉梅每日在規定練習時間，召集各隊員在塲練習，故進步異常迅速，昨日該隊特與該公司男子隊比賽，比賽比例，照女子比賽條例實行，午後三時半起賽，至四時休息。結果女子隊大吃敗戰，輸去二十餘分之多，但隊長陳玉梅當時表示不服，約定數日再次雌雄云。</p>
<p>廣西當局要人白崇禧，李宗仁等，近籌備創辦影片公司，己派某君來滬聘請攝影人材及招募男女演員，據稱其處女作爲「新廣西」，利用廣西特有之風景爲背景，查廣西山水素稱甲天下，將來此片告成，定可爲國片生色不少也。　　有人說，「這是一張武俠片，不過</p>
<p>英雄夜行衣，薄底快靴，换上了西裝革履而巳，「這話並不過份，眞的，初則</p>
<p>兩人對打，再則數十人合打，難分難解</p>
<p>，來了一枝官兵，大團圓了事。至於官兵爲什麽來，打時的起因，有無閒人在旁解勸，雙方實力如何，一槪不必問，反正只要火熾，就算達到了目的了。技</p>
<p>巧有什麽呢？日光那樣强，而不收小鏡頭焦點和光圈，所以亮得閃目，有時演員到像菲洲人，穿插分幕是直接受影響於導演的。這影片導演不行，别的更不</p>
<p>必談了。外景攝得太多，而且地方取得不好，所以更把空間弄得使觀衆找不着</p>
<p>頭緒，時間也有衝突。化裝，内景，道具，也簡陋得很，字幕的字又多又小，眞看不淸楚。</p>
<p>羅克朋作那靑年除去舊劇舞台上的武功以外。表演還不錯，馬鳳棲過於文明戲化，表演雖勉强可觀，却不合身份</p>
<p>，鄔麗珠工作輕，表情却吃力得很，武功是「頂括括。」</p>
<p>總之，這片在一般低級趣味的人或愛好文明戲的人看來，也許是一張好片子，却談不到什麽藝術。</p>
<h3>天一短訊一束</h3>
<p>— 龍子</p>
<p>表芑香導演，陳玉梅主演，劃炳華魏鵬飛合演的有聲片「掙扎」，及邵醉翁導演，袁美雲主演，鮑志超王慧娟合演的無聲片「飛絮」，現在都己攝竣，俟剪接後，卽可送京檢查。</p>
<p>胡姗陸　霞主演之默片，前進」，由邵醉翁導演，于思助理導論，該片爲一愛國軍　影片，日前曾赴融園攝取外景，不日須攝大軍出發及衝鋒諸幕。</p>
<p>陳玉梅主演「掙扎」後，卽將　續主演一有聲</p>
<p>片「劇本巳　備就緖，片名尙未决定，合演者，大約爲田方，蕭正中，張振鐸，馬陋芬等，下星期將先赴外埠攝外景。</p>
<p>脫離影界多年的陸劍芬，最近加入天一，聞巳訂立合同，每月薪水二百元。陸在五六年前，本爲天一演員，後因與人結婚，故脫離銀幕生活云。</p>
<p>天一南方合作攝製的有聲歌舞影片，「白金龍」，係湯曉丹導演，薛覺先唐雪卿主演，該片早巳攝成，送電影檢查會檢查，因爲粤語部份須　　譯出後再行審查，所以延擱了好久，現在巳經核准，不久當可開映。</p>
<p>黎明暉主演的「黎明」，劇本巳將修改完竣，不久卽可開攝，由部醉翁自任導演。「黎明」攝峻後，黎明暉擬與天一全體小妹妹邵素霞，邵素雪，邵素梅，陳綺霞，陳競芳，等合演一片，片名卽爲「小妹妹」。</p>
<h3>「小玩意」攝製巳竣</h3>
<p>— 孟淦</p>
<p>聯華二廠導演孫瑜氏，導演之「小玩意」由阮玲玉，黎莉筣，袁叢美，韓蘭根等主演。劇指係謂：「中國雖玩具一業，亦祇知墨守陳規，不知改良」。内容係描幕一業「小玩意」者之悲哀。攝製以來，行將二月，月前並在無鍚拍攝外景多日，現巳大功告成，全部攝竣，日内正在剪接之中。聞於下月初旬即可公映于本埠北京大戲院云。</p>
<h3>電影小說情海迴瀾ＲｅｕｎｉｏｎｉｎＶｉｅｎｎａ（十）子歸譯</h3>
<p>「我有許多重要的話要說。現在讓我從頭說起吧，我是向你的妻求愛來的。你明白嗎？「「很明白，」安登說。</p>
<p>於是魯道爾夫繼續的說道：「我在十年以前就和愛倫娜相知了。我說相知兩個字，我希望你能明白我們是····」</p>
<p>「以前的事，我都明白。」安登連忙止往了他。</p>
<p>「我們的浪漫史不幸被革命打斷了。十年以來，我覺得没有她的空虚。最近我决回到維也納來看看她。但是現在我看見了她，我需要她的慾望，反而尖銳化了。這就是我們大家要設法解决的一些事實。」</p>
<p>「如果這件事，可以拿合理的方法來處置牠，」安登說，「那是很容易解决的一件事。你要看她，你可以儘量地看一個飽，把她充滿了你的想象。然後你自巳可以看得出來，她於你是没有實質的，好像一個夢境，現在巳消失而不能再重新收集起來了。但是事實上恐怕不能如此簡單。」</p>
<p>「你是對的，朋友，」魯道爾夫說，「事情並不如此簡單。我不能僅以看而滿足。」「安登，那怎麽辦呢？」愛倫娜問道。</p>
<p>「我没有怎麽辦，」安登毅然地說。他忽然轉向魯爾夫這「這是你逼著我做一個妬忌的丈夫了！！我請你馬上就走！」</p>
<p>魯這爾夫想不到他對方的態度驟然間發生急變而愛倫娜則在旁冷眼看著這兩位男人從精神的戰鬥漸漸進展到體力的戰鬥。他們外衣都脫了。魯道爾夫精神抖擻地靜待著對方的攻撃，安登忽然倒退了幾步，搖着頭，很懊喪似的說道：「你可以如願以償了。我被你愚弄了。我有一千個極好的理由要殺死你，但是這樣的局面太使我難堪了。在我妻的前，我要做榜樣的，我不能這樣做。我可以了結這鬥但我却不能開始這鬥爭。」「不是的，安登，你說錯了，」愛倫娜道。「連你亦不能了結這鬥爭，祗有我可以了結這鬥爭。我應該早就明白而不應當從露却飯店裏逃了回來。我永遠走錯踏，這是我的毛病。」門鈴忽然響了，泊伐羅摩奔了進來道：「警察來了！」</p>
<p>「他們來做什麽？」安登問道。</p>
<p>「他們來捉他的，」愛倫娜說道。（未完）</p>

<p>Gunfire at Hada Gate</p>
<h3>Japanese People Make Trouble Unreasonably</h3>
<p>Our Authorities Offer a Reward for the Arrest of the Main Culprit. There Was Also Gunfire at Chongwenmen Yesterday.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, a certain squad leader of the Japanese garrison suddenly went to the Jurentang to see He Yingqin, claiming that yesterday morning, more than 20 Japanese soldiers were returning to camp from an exercise outside the city. When they passed near Hada Gate, a person wearing gray clothes, who appeared to be a soldier, fired two shots at the squad leader from a streetcar with a handgun. Fortunately, no one was injured. He also stated that the seriousness of this matter was no less than the previous attack on the guard at the Japanese embassy gate. The authorities have ordered military and police agencies to thoroughly investigate. Before obtaining conclusive evidence, they will not reply. However, according to one report, a person wearing a gray shirt on a streetcar had a quarrel with another passenger, then took out a handgun to show off and fired two shots at the ground before fleeing. Because the Japanese soldiers happened to be passing by, it may have caused a misunderstanding. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There was gunfire at Chongwenmen. The shooter wore new gray clothing and new collar badges. It may have been the work of a certain party. The Japanese Ministry of the Army will use the so-called shooting of Japanese soldiers as an excuse to make a mountain out of a molehill. Our authorities are paying great attention to it and offering a reward of 5,000 yuan for the arrest of the main culprit. At 9 PM on the evening of the 22nd, a red meteor was discovered in the sky, shaped like a lantern, moving from southwest to northeast. It was rumored to have been released by a certain party to confuse the people. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

Because the military and political situation in Chahar Province is complicated, it was decided to invite Tong Linge, Ji Hongchang, Fang Zhenwu, etc. to a meeting in Xincun tomorrow morning to discuss the situation and to have the representatives stay for several days to study the situation at length. The resettlement of Fang's troops is still difficult. Fang does not agree with the title of Forest Reclamation Co-Director or Provincial Committee. Fang is unlikely to affect the overall situation.

<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangjiakou said that more than 10,000 people attended the second mass meeting of Zhangjiakou citizens on the 19th. Feng attended and gave a speech. There were many slogans in the city. Feng told people that he was willing to resist Japan and save the country as an ordinary citizen. During this period, he did not want to be an official. Judging from his will, he does not seem willing to serve as the Forest Reclamation Supervisor. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng has incorporated Wang Shiming's bandit troops in the Kangbao area and appointed Wang as a division commander, transferring the more than 2,000 bandits to Dongpu, a few miles from Zhangjiakou, under the command of Tong Linge. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Luan Dong Puppet Army</p>
<h3>Still No Solution</h3>
<p>Li's Bandit Actively Expands the Organization. The Puppet Army in Various Counties Wantonly Harasses.</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is still no solution to the problem of the puppet army of Li Jichun and others in Luan Dong. The Japanese Kwantung Army has not yet given a clear answer to the various items proposed by our side. It is said that the Japanese side is still implying that Li's bandit should take in the defeated troops and unemployed vagrants from Luanxi, as well as the righteous armies from various places on the border of Rehe, and actively expand the organization, dividing them into twelve general detachments and appointing twelve general commanders. The local people are being harassed to an unbearable extent. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Lutai reports that a Japanese plane came at around 3 PM today and flew away after several reconnaissance runs. Zhao Lei's puppet army in Ninghe withdrew, and its whereabouts are unknown. Dozens of Japanese soldiers occasionally come and go to Jiangwakou to reconnoiter. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The problem of resolving the puppet army has stalled because a reply has not yet been received from Mutō. Japanese troops have not yet completely withdrawn from various places, and the puppet army in various counties is wantonly harassing the people. The people in the urban areas have fled, and the land is desolate. Our side is extremely anxious. The Japanese side's aim seems to be to delay the entire withdrawal of troops and the resolution of the puppet army, or perhaps there are other demands. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, dozens of bandits have been discovered in the Baodi Jixian area, disguised as Japanese soldiers, looting everywhere. The people cannot bear it. The puppet army in the Luan Dong area has opened gambling dens and opium sales bureaus in many places. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

(22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side has not yet withdrawn the puppet army led by Li Jichun, which has delayed progress in North China. Although the war has ended, trains are still not running, and trade is sluggish because the puppet army is still stationed along the railways. Today's newspaper reported on He Zhuguo's interview, saying that he heard that the Japanese side had decided not to provide Li with further financial assistance, but it seems that they are still providing military supplies.

<p>(Beiping) The Xu brigade of the Righteous Army under Wang Yunping burned down the Japanese airfield in Xipingfangzi, Chaoyang, at the beginning of the month, and shot through four or five Japanese planes with guns and bullets.

<h3>Zhang Weicun Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Weicun, a member of the Executive Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Department, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd, saying that the situation in Shandong Province was also very urgent during the recent crisis in North China. Later, after the signing of the North China Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, Feng Yuxiang suddenly claimed to be the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Zhangjiakou. Because Chairman Han of Shandong has been on close terms with Feng in the past, there has been much speculation. In fact, since Han took charge of Shandong, he has followed the orders of the Central Government in all military, political, and party affairs. He heard that Feng was willing to abolish the name of the Anti-Japanese Army. However, the crux of the matter lies in the prior resolution of the issues surrounding his subordinates Fang Zhenwu and Sun Dianying. Currently, Feng has reached an understanding with the Central Government through the persuasion of Song Zheyuan and Chairman Han. The Chahar situation is not difficult to resolve. In the future, Feng's troops may be incorporated by Song Zheyuan. In addition to reporting everything to the Central Government and President Wang during his trip to Nanjing, he will stay for another three to five days and then go to Jiangxi to visit Jiang.

<h3>Giving Instructions to the 61st Division</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) According to information from Quanzhou, Jiang Guangnai gave instructions to the 61st Division on the morning of the 21st, saying that although there are many soldiers in the country, few can shoulder the heavy responsibility of the revolution. We cannot but hope that you will take on this heavy responsibility. Cai continued the instructions, saying that China has 3 million soldiers, but it cannot recover lost territory. The biggest reason is that the soldiers do not have the determination to serve the country. We are prepared to resist Japan to the end. To resist Japan, we must first eliminate the obstacles to resisting Japan, and then there will be a way. After Jiang flew to the province at noon, Cai returned to Zhang in a car, arriving at 6 PM.

<h3>Japan's Attempt on Inner Mongolia</h3>
<p>Actively Lobbying the Mongols. Want to Make Them Break Away From Our Country.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese warlords recently wanted to make the entire Inner Mongolia break away from our country and surrender to the puppet government. The Japanese are now using three methods to lobby our Mongolian compatriots, allowing them to choose one to implement: 1) Unite with Outer Mongolia; 2) Inner Mongolia become independent; 3) Cooperate with the puppet regime. However, the Mongolian side has also seen through this Japanese conspiracy and wants to complete local autonomy under the guidance of our central government. No matter how the Japanese promote it, it will be difficult to move their will. Recently, the Japanese have colluded with a small number of unscrupulous Mongolians and are preparing to hold a conference in the Xilin Gol League area in June or July to intensify their agitation. If they can get their wish, they will hold a so-called Japanese-Manchu-Mongolian Conference in Changchun to organize a pseudo-Oriental International to compete with the League of Nations. It is said that young Mongolians in Jilin and Qinghai are extremely angry upon hearing the news and are now discussing countermeasures. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

According to reliable sources in diplomatic circles, there is no basis for this matter. US President Roosevelt, the US State Department, and the Japanese Embassy in the US have all denied this matter, saying that they have absolutely no knowledge of this negotiation. US officials even said that Japan's interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is fundamentally different from the US interpretation, and the United States will definitely not agree.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Goes to London</h3>

<h3>Zhou Yawei Talks About Military Service</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Yawei talks about the preparations for the implementation of the Military Service Law. Regular military service is divided into three types: active duty, regular service, and continued service. In areas where local autonomy has been completed, qualified men of age who volunteer for military service may be recruited. Those aged 20 to 25 who pass the examination will enter the camp for active duty, which will last three years before returning home. Regular service is filled by those who have completed active duty, for a term of six years. They will be stationed in their hometowns during peacetime and must attend prescribed exercises. They will be called back to camp during wartime mobilization. Continued service is filled by those who have completed regular service and will continue until the age of 40. Their duties are the same as those of regular service, but their term of service may be extended during wartime. Household registration statistics, population surveys, and the management of servicemen in their hometowns will be managed by the Ministries of Military Affairs and Interior. National military education matters will be managed by the Training Headquarters and the Ministry of Education. The country will be divided into division and regimental areas, and necessary agencies will be established within each area to manage these matters. Furthermore, matters concerning exemptions and deferments from national military service and regular military service should also be discussed and decided in light of the actual social conditions in the country. The total number of national regular military service personnel should be determined based on the needs of national defense and security in the country's territory. It is tentatively assumed to be 1.2 million people. Furthermore, assuming that the national population is 400 million, and deducting the 800,000 people currently in active service, there is still a need for 400,000 people. According to surveys, adult men account for 15% of the national population, excluding women and the elderly. This means that there are 60 million adult men in the country. On average, one person is selected out of 150 people. Under this ratio, there is absolutely no need for compulsory conscription. Some people advocate adopting a military service tax law, which would require people who are required to serve in the military to pay a certain amount of tax if they are unwilling to serve. The intention is that if they cannot serve the country, they can pay a monetary price to share the government's responsibility and fulfill their obligations as citizens. I am opposed to this.

<h3>Post-War Arrangements in North China</h3>
<p>After the signing of the Sino-Japanese truce agreement, the bloody war has temporarily come to an end. The people of Tianjin can also breathe a sigh of relief for the time being. However, we dare not predict whether Japan, with its ambition to challenge, will stop here. Although the civilian officials and those who are well aware of the current world situation in Japan strongly advocate a rapid return to normalcy in order to develop the Chinese market, the militarists, who are inherently stubborn, are still unwilling to lay down their arms. Therefore, the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin East refuse to withdraw promptly, using pretexts for delay. Furthermore, the province of Chahar has long been coveted by Japan. The vanguard of Zhangjiakou is Duolun, which is an important transportation hub between inland China and the Mongolian banners. The Japanese are deliberately aggressive. Therefore, before invading Luan Dong, they sent cavalry to occupy Duolun. Now that Feng Yuxiang's Anti-Japanese Allied Army has been disbanded, we cannot comment on whether the Japanese army will launch any further attacks. Therefore, the post-war arrangements in Chahar are out of the question.</p>
<p>What can be discussed today regarding the post-war arrangements in North China includes: how to take over Tianjin East diplomatically, how to deal with the puppet troops in this area domestically, and how to resettle the displaced refugees. If the Japanese side is sincere, there should be no problem with the withdrawal of Japanese troops. In the unfortunate event that they continue to rely on force, we must not be unprepared and repeat the mistakes of the past. The disposal of the puppet troops should also be fought for with all efforts and resolved thoroughly, so that they will not become collaborators and endanger our country again. As for the relief of refugees, it is the most important and most difficult task. If we continue to use the established methods of disaster relief, raising funds and distributing aid, and consider it safe as long as we can get through the immediate crisis, then we believe that is not advisable. The counties of Tianjin East, which have suffered severely from the war, have been subjected to supplies during the war, bombings by Japanese aircraft, and now, trampling by the puppet troops. Those who can survive are few. Immediate compensation is essential, but the fundamental work is the revival of the destroyed cities and the revitalization of the devastated rural areas. Everywhere, the efforts of the local people are needed, and even more so, the active assistance of the government. It is not enough to fulfill our responsibilities by simply establishing a general social order politically to allow people to live in peace. We must also provide special assistance to handicrafts and small businesses in terms of economic substance, so that they can quickly resume their businesses, and farmers can quickly return to their land to engage in farming. The government should also provide them with farming tools and the necessary capital for cultivation. In this way, the devastation of Tianjin East can be revived.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire country, the decline of rural areas has become a widespread problem. It is not unique to a particular region, but it is most severe in North China. The most prosperous era of Chinese civilization was centered in North China, and the rural areas were the foundation of our nation. In other words, the finances of the government for thousands of years have relied on the farmers, but the improvement of the land has often been neglected. The fertility of the land is limited, and there are no ways to cultivate it, so it gradually shows signs of exhaustion. If we do not take timely action to save it, I fear that in one or two hundred years, areas near Kaifeng will inevitably turn into deserts, and other fertile lands will also turn into barren soil. Moreover, the provinces in the Yellow River basin, such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan, face an even greater crisis: opium, morphine, and red pills. The harm of opium is well known, but the toxicity of morphine and red pills is ten to a hundred times that of opium. Recently, their poison has penetrated deep into the rural areas, and even many scholars and gentry have become addicted. This phenomenon not only poisons the present but will also leave harm to future generations, trapping our Chinese nation in a sorrow from which it cannot extricate itself. Now that the military situation in North China has come to an end, we are seeking to start anew with the people. We earnestly hope that the authorities will impose stricter bans on the circulation of poisonous substances. It may not be the only way to cultivate vitality.</p>
<p>World Economic Conference</p>
<h3>New Turn in the Situation</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative Proposes Important Resolution: Advocating Gradual Elimination of Artificial Trade Barriers; Washington Simultaneously Issues Statement: Believing Temporary Currency Stabilization Plan is Untimely</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Confidant, Professor Moley, Sets Out for England</h3>
<p>(London) U.S. Secretary of State Hull today submitted a very important proposal to the World Economic Conference, intending to lay the foundation for the gradual elimination of artificial trade barriers. It is said that the purpose of this proposal is to urge the Economic Committee to respond to various trade barriers. This proposal was submitted in the name of the U.S. delegation, along with instructions from the United States. The content of this proposal is as follows: "Countries" impose restrictions on imported goods in the form of tariffs, quotas, and prohibitions, while subsidizing exports. This trend has resulted in all countries adopting nationalistic behaviors. If this behavior is carried to the extreme, the result will inevitably be the complete elimination of international trade and the restoration of the closed-door policy of the Middle Ages. To restore the world's vitality and maintain an adequate standard of living, this trend must be curbed. For this reason, it is proposed that the countries participating in the World Economic Conference must agree that: ㈠ adopting or continuing extreme economic nationalism policies and continuing to impose trade barriers or discrimination is a move that violates the common interests of all countries; ㈡ import prohibitions, quotas, and other arbitrary restrictions should be completely removed as soon as possible; ㈢ tariff barriers should be reduced as soon as possible to the point where trade can resume normal free flow through reciprocal bilateral or multilateral agreements; ㈣ when concluding bilateral or</p>
<p>multilateral agreements, attention should be paid not to inject discriminatory characteristics, because this characteristic is beneficial to the contracting countries, but harmful to the entire world trade. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) An important announcement was made at the U.S. venue today, opposing the temporary stabilization of currency, saying that some parties have overemphasized the consideration of temporary fixed currency plans. This is not the matter of the U.S. delegation. Those who are considering this plan are representatives of the financial departments and central banks of the UK, the U.S., and France, and the representative of the U.S. Treasury Department is Mr. Sprague. The U.S. government now feels that the temporary stabilization plan is untimely. The U.S. government believes that the United States' efforts to raise prices will greatly contribute to the success of the conference. Any action that may hinder this great effort and cause a sharp drop in prices would be more damaging than the palliative measure of temporary currency stabilization. The U.S. official announcement mentioned the ultimate objective, saying that the U.S. delegation has submitted a proposal aimed at promoting the final stabilization of unstable currencies worldwide. The U.S. delegation also supports any plan that can establish a unified national currency policy to revitalize economic activity and increase prices. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The proposal submitted by U.S. Secretary of State Hull to the Economic Committee today is a substitute for the ten-percent tax reduction proposal that the U.S. delegation previously submitted and then withdrew. The text of today's proposal was drafted in Washington before the U.S. representatives left the country. Today, it was announced upon the instructions of the U.S. President. It is believed that this move can prevent the conference from stalling before Professor Moley, a trusted advisor of the U.S. President, arrives in England with special instructions from the U.S. President. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>The Organization of the Conference is Too Complex</p>
<h3>The United States and Germany are Obstacles to Currency Stabilization</h3>
<p>(London) The situation at today's World Economic Conference is merely a delay, seemingly waiting for the arrival of U.S. Undersecretary of State Moley in England. Some representatives said that the organization of the conference is cumbersome and poorly managed, and they are somewhat disappointed. The conference secretariat has produced a chart of the conference organization and distributed it to the representatives for reference. The shape of the chart is like a large tree. In addition to the two major committees and seven subcommittees, there are also several new subcommittees under consideration. Although the members of each subcommittee meet daily, almost every action prompts someone to ask about the U.S. attitude. However, the U.S. representatives remain tight-lipped, seemingly waiting for Moley's new instructions. However, Moley will not arrive in England until next week, so the enthusiasm for the conference has gradually waned. Since the opening of the conference, the only issue discussed in detail has been the stabilization of currency. Now, almost all countries are willing to stabilize immediately, but the United States and Germany are obstructing it. Therefore, everyone is eager for Moley to come to England so that the situation may change. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to the current situation, the United States and Germany are the main obstacles to the currency stabilization plan. Other countries are generally in agreement. France, Italy, Switzerland, Poland, Norway, Bulgaria, Sweden, Greece, Argentina, and Romania, in particular, insist that stabilizing currency is the best way to raise prices.</p>
<p>It is said that the U.S. attitude is also generally in favor of some kind of stabilization plan, but the price of the gold standard that it wants to stabilize is too low, which other countries are unwilling to accept. If the United States proposes an exchange rate of four dollars and forty cents for the British pound as rumored in the newspapers, it is expected that Britain will be the first to refuse to discuss it.</p>
<p>Germany, on the other hand, is different from the United States. It does not agree to join a straightforward agreement to stabilize its own currency. The German representative admitted that even if the United States, Britain, and France reach a practical agreement, Germany will insist on being able to freely dispose of its own monetary policy without being restricted, which is a purely nationalistic view.</p>
<p>It was recently heard that the stabilization plan supported by the European central banks stipulates a contingency fund for Germany to dispose of, in order to persuade it to join the currency stabilization agreement. However, as of late at night, the United States and Germany still disapprove of this plan. The German representative stated that Germany is unwilling to assume a gold standard obligation, but also solemnly declared that this attitude does not mean that Germany intends to abandon the gold standard soon. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State</p>
<h3>Issues Statement Before Leaving the Country</h3>
<p>Intends to Provide the Delegation with a New Background; Hopes the Conference Will Achieve Practical Results</p>
<p>(New York) Professor Moley, a trusted advisor to President Roosevelt, the Secretary of State, stated today before embarking on the Manhattan cruise ship to London that the instructions he was carrying from the President did not contain any special orders. He also said that the rumors that President Roosevelt would personally participate in the conference may not be true. Since the U.S. delegation went to London, the situation has undergone various developments. He felt that giving the U.S. representatives a new background would definitely be beneficial. He believed that the preliminary meetings of the conference in the past two weeks have been extremely helpful in exploring the possibility of practical action. The U.S. delegation will actively proceed with the plans they formulated before their departure. The United States expects that the efforts of the U.S. delegation will achieve practical results. Moley had a last-minute meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday to listen to Roosevelt's final instructions. People here generally believe that the nearly-stumbling London talks will be given a new life, and it is believed that London will feel the impact of Moley's discussions with the President even before Moley arrives in London. People in Washington still believe that the move to stabilize currency does not need to be rushed. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Before leaving the U.S., Moley went to the President's yacht off the coast of Massachusetts for a secret talk, but the content of the talk was not allowed to be disclosed. He only said that the United States can hope that the second phase of the Economic Conference will have practical results, and he would not allow any further interpretation of this statement. Since the initial stage of the Economic Conference focused on the issue of currency stabilization, financiers are mostly suspicious that Moley's remarks may not refer to the currency issue. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>New White House Instructions</p>
<h3>Cause Speculation in Various Circles</h3>
<p>(London) Although no one has mentioned the content of the new instructions sent by Roosevelt to the U.S. delegation, people here believe that the new instructions must be to order the U.S. representatives not to take any action, closing the door to compromise. The wording of the new instructions must be very gentle. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Undersecretary of State Moley brought the President's new instructions to London. According to sources, the instructions Moley brought will not cause the U.S. delegation to drastically change its policies. The U.S. industry and commerce are now gradually improving. When Moley arrives in London, he will firmly instruct the U.S. delegation not to express approval of any proposals that are not closely aligned with U.S. domestic policies. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Hull Will Remain in London</h3>
<p>(London) It is heard that U.S. representative Hull will not leave London during the Economic Conference. The rumor that he will return to the U.S. is inaccurate. The currency stabilization proposal will probably have to wait for Professor Moley to arrive here before a conclusion can be reached, but it will only be a temporary agreement. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Asks U.S. Delegation</p>
<h3>Currency Negotiations Should Be Kept Secret</h3>
<p>To Avoid Hindering the Progress of the Conference</p>
<p>(London) After the U.S. delegation received an important telegram from Washington today, British Prime Minister MacDonald discussed everything with several members of the U.S. delegation. It is heard that MacDonald asked the U.S. delegation to keep the currency stabilization negotiations strictly confidential so that the Economic Conference could proceed with other issues, and at the same time, prevent the market from being shaken by rumors of currency stabilization. The U.S. delegation has agreed to temporarily refrain from issuing any further news about currency stabilization to the outside world. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>U.S. Representatives Remain Tight-Lipped</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the European representatives of the Currency Negotiation Subcommittee have been pressing U.S. representative Coolidge all day to explain what the United States wants to do. Coolidge still did not express anything, but according to reports, the U.S. President will propose a stabilization proposal himself. It is believed here that the U.S. President's true intention is not to approve any gold standard solution that would cause domestic securities and goods to depreciate, because the rise in U.S. prices is mostly due to the depreciation of the gold standard. Therefore, if the gold standard is to be stabilized, its value must be at an extremely low level. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>French Prime Minister's Attitude is Negative</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Daladier seems to have adopted a negative attitude towards the London World Economic Conference recently, because he stated today that due to the heavy workload of the National Assembly, if he returns to London in the future, he will only be able to make a short stay. Furthermore, he has decided to return to his hometown of Orange on July 14. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>A European Currency Truce</h3>
<p>Currency Stabilization is Slow to Progress; Representatives of Small Countries are Becoming Impatient</p>
<p>(Paris) With the stabilization of the U.S. dollar seemingly hopeless, the French financial community is now trying to temporarily fix the exchange rate between the British pound and the French franc. This move will create a European currency truce, excluding the United States. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives of various small European countries are quite impatient with the slow progress of currency stabilization. Therefore, they have applied to the Economic Conference to focus its efforts on seeking an agreement that includes various European countries. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>U.S.-Russian Talks</p>
<h3>Approaching Agreement on Trade Issues</h3>
<p>Opening a Glimmer of Hope for the Restoration of Relations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(London) There are still many obstacles to the United States recognizing Soviet Russia. After two hours of candid conversation between U.S. Senator Coolidge and Russian Deputy Chief Representative Mellerock, at the luncheon table yesterday, the Russian side has learned the general situation. Today, Mellerock telegraphed the situation of the conversation to Moscow. Although this conversation was completely informal, both sides reported to their respective governments. It is heard that there are no difficult issues in the commercial aspect of the relations between the two countries. All obstacles are outside of commerce. Coolidge told Mellerock in detail that unless these obstacles are eliminated, there will still be strong opposition to the recognition issue within the United States. For example, the American Federation of Labor, the American Veterans Association, and other large groups are the centers of opposition to recognition. Unless Soviet Russia guarantees not to ship goods produced by forced labor to the United States, and not to allow Soviet Russian groups to interfere with U.S. labor groups, the American Federation of Labor cannot agree to the restoration of relations. Also, although U.S. churches have a lenient attitude towards the recognition issue, they also want Russia to guarantee freedom of religion in all treaties. As for many financial institutions, they cannot agree to the restoration of relations until Russia acknowledges the debts owed to the United States during the Tsarist and Kerensky eras and is willing to open discussions. Furthermore, a section of U.S. opinion wants Russia to withdraw from the Third International. In addition, there are several political issues that are not expected to be difficult to resolve. Subsequently, the two sides discussed trade issues for a long time, paying particular attention to reasonable credit trade, so that Russia can purchase more goods in the United States. Mr. May stated that if diplomatic relations can be fully restored and the scope of credit expanded, trade between the two countries can be greatly increased. It is heard that Mr. Kurenski stated in advance that he was not speaking on behalf of the U.S. government, but merely stating the facts. As for the issues in the Economic Conference, the two sides agreed on many points. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Currency Committee</h3>
<p>Silver Subcommittee Meeting Held; Chairman Mr. Pittman; Hopes to Reach an Agreement Soon; Restrict Silver Supply and Sales</p>
<p>(London) The subcommittee of the Economic Conference's Currency Committee, which is discussing silver, met this morning, chaired by U.S. Representative Pittman, and discussed for a long time, deciding to use the second part of the Pittman resolution as a basis for discussion. The second part of the resolution advocates that a certain percentage of the reserves of each central bank should use silver. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) After today's meeting of the Silver Subcommittee, Chairman Pittman told reporters that there has been such satisfactory progress within the committee that the joint effort of the seven countries to create silver price instability is not far off, and may be realized as early as the beginning of next week. This effort will seek to obtain a general agreement to restrict the production and sale of silver. He intends to gather representatives from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, India, and China at the end of the week for informal talks to discuss this matter. The situation at this morning's meeting of the subcommittee was very satisfactory, he said. It is heard that Mr. Pittman made a speech at the meeting, suggesting that silver-producing countries and silver-holding countries should conclude an agreement as soon as possible to restrict the supply and sale of silver, saying that the United States is willing to immediately join this negotiation, hoping that India will sell a limited amount of silver to the market, and said that the purpose of the resolution submitted by the United States to the Currency Committee on Saturday is first to rebuild the gold standard as the standard for measuring currency prices worldwide, but the restoration of the gold standard must use silver as an aid, so that countries without sufficient gold can also purchase goods from gold standard countries, and strongly argued that the unnatural supply caused by the destruction of silver coins must be stopped urgently. When Mr. Pittman was carrying out the U.S. silver plan in the Silver Subcommittee, U.S. Chief Representative Hull also submitted an important resolution in the Economic Committee (content see above). (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>The Silver Issue</p>
<h3>U.S.-China Opinions Conflict</h3>
<p>(London) The opinions and goals of the United States and China on the silver issue are actually contradictory. The United States wants an open silver market, while China advocates that silver should have a stable price, and that its freedom of movement should be restricted to the lowest possible extent. The U.S. representative Mr. Pittman and the subcommittee handling the silver issue must now reconcile the differences between the two sides to reach a consensus. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Palliative Subcommittee</p>
<h3>Discussing British Proposals</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the two subcommittees of the World Economic Conference's Economic Committee and Currency Committee continue to work. Many representatives today expressed their views on the proposal put forward by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain in the first subcommittee, expressing their agreement. French Minister of Finance Flandin suggested that the proposal should be submitted to a special subcommittee for consideration, and then a recommendation should be put forward quickly. He also said that curbing production is necessary, but at the same time, it is also necessary to increase consumption capacity, so that the suffering of the world's people can come to an end. He supports the policy of monetary easing as a fundamental solution, but the activities in the market must be closely considered by experts. The Italian representative Mr. Nidius agreed with this in principle, but said that if a free lending policy is to achieve the desired effect on prices, it is necessary to prevent all parties from using loans for speculative activities, otherwise, although it may temporarily create a false prosperity, it will eventually create a major crisis. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Difficult Problem of Trade Restrictions</h3>
<p>(London) The first subcommittee of the Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference is now dealing with the difficult problem of trade restrictions. This subcommittee held a closed meeting this afternoon, chaired by German representative Mr. Kroger, to discuss a number of proposals, including a draft proposal from the British representative, advocating the abolition of clearing and exchange agreements within the possible scope, and the abolition of import prohibitions, without affecting the exceptions to protection internationally recognized. The difference between import quotas for domestic producers and production quotas aimed at raising prices in accordance with international agreements should be clearly analyzed. The British proposal also advocates the gradual abolition of various autocratic import quotas, recognizing this as the most important event, but said that the best solution to this particular difficult problem, arising from a certain drastic drop in prices, is for the most relevant countries in international agreements to seek better methods of adjusting production and sales. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Economic Committee</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative Submits Important Proposal</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that Mr. Hull personally handed over a copy of the resolution (content see above) to the meeting during the secret meeting of the Business Policy Subcommittee today. For a week, the U.S. delegation has maintained a completely silent attitude. Now, this resolution has been submitted suddenly, which is enough to refresh the views of all parties and make small countries revive the hope of the U.S. representatives to speed up the conference affairs. (National News)</p>
<h3>The Chairman is Both Firm and Flexible</h3>
<p>(London) Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Collie, the chairman of the Economic Committee, is quite adept at handling conference affairs with both firmness and flexibility. This morning, some members opposed holding a meeting at 3:00 p.m., thinking that the time was too tight after lunch, and suggested holding a meeting at 3:30 p.m. Corinne said, very good, how about we start work half an hour earlier in the morning? So the British, who usually get up late, thought that holding a meeting at 10:30 a.m. was too early. The chairman then slowly said, very good, we might as well hold meetings at 11:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., but the afternoon meeting must continue until 6:30 p.m. instead of 6:00 p.m. At this point, the intention to reduce working hours was dispelled by Corinne in one sentence. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Russian Proposal Shelved</h3>
<p>(London) The proposal by Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov in the Economic Subcommittee to conclude an economic non-aggression pact has been temporarily shelved due to the rejection by Chairman German Representative Croger to initiate a discussion. British Secretary of Commerce Hinsman stated that he believed that certain trade restrictions imposed due to political actions are legitimate actions, and that they should be lifted only for economic reasons. Mr. Hingtsman's words were addressed to Soviet Russia and Ireland. (National News, 21st)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Irish Economic Conflict</h3>
<p>According to reports, in addition to the Economic Committee and the Silver Subcommittee, the Business Policy and Monetary Technology Subcommittees also held closed-door meetings this morning. The Irish representative at the Business Policy Subcommittee meeting brought up the punitive tariffs imposed by England in the Anglo-Irish economic war and compared England's handling of war debts with the United States to its dealings with Ireland. He stated that the existence of this conflict between England and Ireland was an obstacle to the meeting and questioned how agreement could be reached on customs duties and customs policies. [P Anglo-Russian Trade War</p>
<p>In addition, the trade war between England and Russia also received attention today, although it was not brought up in the meeting. It was discussed when Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov had a five-minute conversation with British Prime Minister MacDonald. According to Russian sources, MacDonald asked Litvinov when this conflict between the two countries could end. Litvinov replied that the one who tied the bell should untie it. MacDonald then said that he was not a diplomat but wanted to see the dispute resolved. Litvinov responded, "Although you are the Prime Minister," (National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Addition of Two Subcommittees</h3>
<p>Immediately after the Economic Committee convened at 11:10 this morning, Chairman Colijn immediately added two subcommittees to consider options other than tariffs and quotas. One was to discuss the issue of direct and indirect trade subsidies, composed of twelve countries: England, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Greece, Japan, Finland, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. The other was to discuss other options besides subsidies, composed of twelve countries: Germany, England, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ecuador, Java, Toronto, Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Argentina. Subsequently, it was announced that the British Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Runciman, had been recommended to serve as the general rapporteur of the Economic Committee.

Song Ziwen then attended a banquet hosted by British Prime Minister MacDonald. In addition to Song, several other national representatives and their wives were also at the banquet.

<h3>German Foreign Minister Returns to Berlin</h3>
<p>Taking a laissez-faire approach to the work of the conference Affected by internal party strife (London) People close to the German delegation say that Germany currently does not want to put forward any concrete proposals. As for the changes in the delegation's personnel, it can be said to indicate that Germany is taking a completely laissez-faire attitude towards the work of the economic conference. Since the incident of Germany requesting the return of its colonies, Germany at least temporarily does not want to participate in the actual work of the conference. More and more people are speculating this way. Furthermore, people in general have felt deeply for several days that the infighting between the German National People's Party and the National Socialist Party is very fierce, and that they want to use the Economic Conference as a tool for their mutual competition. Foreign Minister Neurath and two economic experts from the delegation returned to Berlin tonight. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) When German Foreign Minister Neurath, a delegate to the World Economic Conference, departed for Berlin this evening, Communists demonstrated at Liverpool Station.

<h3>Raising Money Under the Guise of Resisting Japan</h3>
<p>The Scoundrels in New York are Unforgivable The Patriotism of Overseas Chinese is Commendable (New York) Overseas Chinese in the United States have donated as much as 10 million US dollars to support the anti-Japanese military, but only 360,000 yuan has actually been transferred to the Chinese anti-Japanese army. After a secretary from Beiyang University announced this at the Chinese United Association, the Chinese in New York realized that they had been deceived and were very frustrated. In addition, there are also some scoundrels who make a living by deceiving overseas Chinese. Because most of the laundry businesses in New York are in the hands of overseas Chinese, and American law requires these people to have their fingerprints taken before obtaining a business license, some scoundrels are organizing groups and campaigning to abolish this law as a pretext to raise money from overseas Chinese. Although their crime is under the guise of resisting Japan, their behavior is also abhorrent. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan's Huge Military Expenditure</h3>
<p>Next Year's Budget Exceeds 600 Million An Increase of 200 Million Compared to this Year (Nanjing) At 10:00 this morning, the Ministry of the Army held its first budget meeting in the ministry's first conference room. Minister of the Army Araki, Vice-Minister of the Army Yanagawa, and the heads of various bureaus and sections attended. First, Minister Araki stated the budget guidelines for the coming year, which must be reduced to form the budget. The meeting adjourned at 11:30. The main items of important requests submitted to the ministry's deliberations are roughly as follows: (1) 250 million yen for materials preparation; (2) 144.5 million yen for Manchurian affairs; (3) 50 million yen for new requests; totaling 444.5 million yen. If the basic budget of 200 million yen is added, the Ministry of the Army's total budget for the coming year will reach 644.5 million yen. Compared with this year's budget of 444.7 million yen, this is an actual increase of 200 million yen. The reason for the increase is the increase in materials preparation expenses by 100 million yen and the expenditures for other new projects. Therefore, Minister Araki considered the current state of finances and the gains and losses of weapons storage, and divided the 250 million yen for materials preparation into the 90th and 2nd years, and intended to reduce the expenses for new projects. Therefore, the actual amount requested from the Ministry of Finance will be reduced, but it will not be less than this year's. (22nd Dentu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army held a budget meeting on the morning of the 22nd. Vice-Minister Yanagawa explained the budget requested by the army for the coming year as follows: (1) The expenses for the Manchurian Incident have not been completely decided, but this time the expenses for maintaining security in Jehol Province have been increased, which is how much more than the 44.6 million yuan in this year's budget; (2) The expenses for the preparation of weapons and other materials, due to the early continuation fee, are more than 24.9 million yuan; (3) The educational subsidy is more than 6.2 million yuan; (4) The system improvement expenses are 4 million yuan; (5) The army fuel production expenses are 5 million yuan; (6) The expenses for establishing sanatoriums, etc., are 5 million yuan, for a total of 45 million yuan. Next, the Director of the Accounting Bureau and the Chief of the Accounting Section explained the content of the budget proposal. The meeting is scheduled to continue on the 24th.

<h3>Japanese Merchants Deeply Affected</h3>
<p>Government and Private Sector Negotiate Appropriate Strategies (Tokyo) Having tasted the bitterness of China's rejection of Japanese goods, recently the voices in India rejecting Japanese goods have been even louder. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes that Japan's foreign trade is in a very critical situation. Yesterday, it held a standing committee meeting and, after passing a proposal, suggested to the Ministers of Finance and Commerce and Industry that a joint government-private sector deliberation mechanism should be established. The handling of major issues should not be based on the judgment of one department or biased towards the opinions of one group, but should consider the interests of the entire Japanese industry and work together as a nation to properly handle the tariff issues of various countries overseas.

If the government negotiates cotton-related matters, only advisors will be sent. (22nd Dentu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram sent from Shimla to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, Consul General Miyake met with Indian Commerce Officer Bowma on the afternoon of the 21st to convey the Japanese government's intention to formally negotiate diplomatically. Bowma replied as follows: "The British government has proposed the Japan-India negotiations to Ambassador Matsudaira, so in formal negotiations, Ambassador Matsudaira should also formally convey the Japanese government's intentions to the British government. The Indian government does not have the authority to conclude treaties under the constitution, so if the consultations are successful, they must be confirmed by the British government. The Simla consultations seem to involve a wide range, so it is hoped that the negotiations can be started as soon as possible." This reply seems to be the result of Commercial Officer Bowma's negotiations with the British government on diplomatic negotiations, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will telegraph Ambassador Matsudaira tomorrow to take formal procedures with the British government.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to implement a compound tariff system, but the Ministry of Finance authorities have some doubts about its effectiveness and are considering adopting other means. It is currently under study. According to the Ministry of Finance, 55% of Japan's imported goods are raw materials or semi-finished products, and their tax rates are quite low. The other 35% are finished products, so the scope of Japan's tariff policy that can be controlled is narrow and has no great effect. Also, in terms of technology, the implementation of compound tariffs is very complex and the procedures are complicated, making it extremely difficult to prepare in the short term.

<p>Japan Union Tokyo Telegram on the 22nd Japanese Northern Ocean fisheries have recently developed greatly. After the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry unified Northern Ocean fisheries last year, the number of fishing boats rushing to the Northern Ocean has reached 400,000 tons, with more than 20,000 people. The bases for Japanese fishermen in the Northern Ocean are the ports of Otaru and Hakodate in Hokkaido, but they are thousands of miles away from the site, making it very inconvenient to supply fuel and food. Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry invested 30,000 yuan in survey fees for Northern Ocean fishery bases. As a result of the survey, it was decided to implement a five-year plan to build a large port on Paramushir Island, the northernmost tip of the Kuril Islands, and to set up storage depots for heavy oil, coal, food, and fishery products as a large base. The budget is 8 million yuan, and construction will begin in May of next year.</p>

<h3>German Party Strife Erupts Again</h3>
<p>Hugenberg Suffers Two Humiliations</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 21st - The fighting troops of the National People's Party, led by Economics Minister Hugenberg, have all been disbanded. Furthermore, the memorandum submitted by Hugenberg at the World Economic Conference, advocating for the return of German colonies, has been rejected by the authorities. After suffering these two humiliations, Hugenberg quietly returned here today. According to the authorities' explanation, the reason for disbanding the National People's Party's fighting troops is that communists had joined the ranks in large numbers, with 70% of the members being former communists, Marxists, or members of fascist groups. Germans say that this move by the authorities proves that Hitler is determined not to allow anyone to compete with him for power or to allow any group to compete with his Brownshirts, even if united. The national secret police are very active today, forcibly closing the institutions of Hugenberg's troops, confiscating the members' green shirts and uniforms, and the Brownshirts are assisting in this. This action was carried out so suddenly, like a thunderclap, that there was no resistance. Only in one place, a member who was formerly a socialist and later joined the National People's Party was shot for refusing police inspection. Hundreds of leaders were arrested in Berlin, as well as hundreds of former communist members. The Stahlhelm, a paramilitary organization in the Rhineland, has been disbanded, its institutions closed, and its property confiscated. Several commissioners from the Social Democratic Party have been dispatched to reorganize the group. Hugenberg will likely be forced to resign soon. However, his aides claim that although Hugenberg has been provoked, he will not allow himself to be removed from his position in such a way. Reuters, Berlin, 22nd - German Jesus adherents are in a fierce dispute because the National Socialist Party intends to appoint Dr. Mueller, a follower of Hitler, as the new Evangelical Church Bishop, replacing Dr. Boedelschwingh. Today, supporters of Mueller convened a meeting at the University of Berlin, but 90% of the students withdrew from the meeting and held another meeting outside the venue, unanimously deciding to support Hitler as a political leader but not recognizing him as a religious leader.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 21st - This morning, Prime Minister Hitler, Vice-Chancellor von Papen, Defense Minister General von Blomberg, and Labor Minister Seldte held a meeting and decided to definitively incorporate the Stahlhelm into the National Socialist Party. However, the Stahlhelm League, which existed before January 31st of this year and is an association of veterans, will still be allowed to exist, with Seldte as chairman, but members must join the National Socialist Party. In this way, the Stahlhelm seems likely to officially become a military reserve organization.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 22nd - Prime Minister Hitler held talks with Economics Minister Hugenberg, discussing the situation at the London Economic Conference and the government's prohibition of the National People's Party's combat organizations. This prohibition has now been extended to various "localities" including Württemberg, Baden, and Anhalt.</p>

<p>39,316,873 647 607</p>
<p>With the announcement of this election, the German National Socialist Labor Party, also known as the German Fascist Party, or the Right-wing Party, received the largest number of votes. This time, a total of 647 representatives were elected to the National Assembly, with the Fascist Party holding 288 seats, accounting for 43.2% of the total. Adding the Black-White-Red Front and other right-wing groups with similar orientations, they could obtain 340 seats, thus forming a majority in the parliamentary government. As a result, the confusing political situation in Germany over the past two years, where there was a parliament but no parliamentary politics, can be restored to parliamentary politics in form. This result, as desired by the government and hoped for by the people, means that the Fascist Party, led by Hitler, which has been campaigning for national salvation for fourteen years, has finally achieved its ultimate hope and greatest victory in entering the parliamentary stage and manipulating politics. This rapid advance and victory, based on the aforementioned reasons and causes, was expected and is not surprising. However, despite the government's various forms of coercion, suppression, and obstruction, the number of votes for the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party was difficult to control. The two parties together still won 201 seats, only slightly fewer than the previous election result, which was truly unexpected. This shows that the left-wing front, no matter how severe the political oppression, is still a central force in German politics. Secondly, there were no significant changes in other parties. Furthermore, observing the overall facts of this election, the number of voters participating in the election reached over 98%, an unprecedentedly high record in German elections, demonstrating a surge in the enthusiasm of voters. The main reason for this, of course, is that the burning of the Reichstag greatly stimulated people's minds, the struggle between the left and right became increasingly acute, and the people could no longer remain silent in this serious period. Not belonging to the left meant voting for the right. Everyone at this time had to make a swift self-determination and a clear expression of their political destiny. Therefore, the high participation rate in the election was entirely created by the situation.</p>
<h3>The New Parliament's New Tasks and Their Significance</h3>
<p>What is the significance of the new parliament? In a word, it is a right-leaning parliament dominated by fascists. With the emergence of this new parliament, Hitler's dictatorial cabinet politics have gained a more solid and powerful foundation. At the same time, it also marks the bankruptcy of German democracy and the beginning of the death sentence for the far-left German Communist Party. Although the Communist Party still holds 81 seats in this new parliament, when this new parliament convened its first meeting of deputies, the Communist Party deputies were rejected, did not receive an invitation to attend the meeting, and had no right to attend the meeting. From this, it can be seen how deeply the Communist Party has been suppressed and how great the power of the fascist right-wing in manipulating parliament is. The Fascist Party's long-standing claim has been to fundamentally eliminate Bolshevist communism, abolish Marx's theory of class struggle, and overthrow the false democratic political system. Now that the German cabinet is led by Hitler and the parliament is exclusively dominated by the Fascist Party, their claims, after the passage of the proposal to amend the Weimar Constitution at the first meeting of parliament, will be fully realized. The left-wing has been completely placed under the trampling iron heel of the government, and its methods can be said to be extremely harsh. The new parliament convened its meeting at a temporary address in the Garrison Church, because the old venue was burned down, and the situation was very embarrassing. The reason why the government decided to use the Garrison Church as the temporary parliament venue is that the remains of Wilhelm II, the second emperor of Germany, are interred in the church. Wilhelm II made the greatest contributions to Germany. Now that Germany is in a period of disunity and crisis, it is hoped that representatives from across the country will come to pay respects and be alerted and united by this martyr. Furthermore, or perhaps because of the auspicious geomantic omens of a dragon coiled and a tiger crouching, it is impossible to say. In any case, the forced relocation of the German parliament venue, like the relocation of the capital of China from Nanjing to Luoyang, inevitably carries the meaning of national crisis. This will become the historical value of the Fascist Party's rule in Germany. Currently, it has been moved back to the Kroll Opera House in Berlin as its meeting place. At present, its most important tasks are approximately the following: (1) Thoroughly complete the national revolution; (2) Strive to fully realize fascist nationalism; (3) Fundamentally eliminate the communist party throughout the country; (4) Implement economic severance and temporary non-cooperation with Jewish people; (5) Restore the glory of Germany.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>From the burning of the German Parliament to the process of the third parliamentary re-election, and to its current political achievements, the political phenomena that have unfolded, though complex and confusing, are, in terms of the entire consistent fact, truly worthy of being called the German National Revolution. Since the burning of the Reichstag, the Weimar Constitution has been amended, all national government organs have been forcibly reorganized, important members of the Communist Party have been arrested, the National Federation of Trade Unions has been dissolved, Jewish people are prohibited from being professors, lawyers, doctors, and other public officials, and from studying at universities. The entire country is forbidden from displaying the black, white, and gold flag of the Republic after the war, and instead, the black, white, and red national flag of the glorious era of the emperors before the war and the swastika flag of the Fascist movement must be displayed. Because of these events, the current Germany is indeed absolutely different in its social face and political atmosphere from Germany three months ago. In Germany itself, of course, this kind of revolution is seen as necessary, and even as the only way to solve the current party strife and division in Germany. The government party with a parliamentary majority has been formed, the parliament can return to normal, and the political situation will not be constantly precarious and turbulent, causing unnecessary election troubles. In terms of the interests of the German people themselves, it can indeed be seen as a comfort in political stability. The danger of redization has also been eliminated, and which citizens who do not want communism would not raise their hands in celebration. Capitalists can sleep soundly, and the Fascist Party is the most radical party opposing the Treaty of Versailles. However, abolishing the Treaty of Versailles has long been a unanimous wish and demand of the whole country. From this point of view, the Fascist Party's rise to power and manipulation of German politics today can only be welcomed by the public and there is no reason to oppose it. In short, due to the intensity of the struggle between the left and right extremes in Germany in recent years and its obvious rightward trend, it was predictable to the journalist that the German national revolution today would be an inevitable result, so it is not surprising. However, we believe that the anti-Semitic racial hatred movement, with this strange behaviour occurring in European civilized society, is deeply saddening for so-called European civilization. Jewish people are German citizens, under the same government, and reside within Germany. Even if they wield great economic power, it is used for Germany and belongs to the national wealth of Germany. Why should they oppress each other so urgently? Since the left-wing has been suspected of destructive national riots, it is necessary for the state to deal with them appropriately. The world is the same, and we do not need to waste words on their rights and wrongs. However, because the German people are about to lose their rights to freedom of speech and assembly, if Madame Roland were still alive, I wonder how she would cry for the lack of political freedom. However, for the sake of adapting to its inherent social interests and relationships, a certain society or country will adopt appropriate measures to deal with its circumstances. This is also a common practice in politics. As for the future prospects of the new parliament, because the government and the parliament have formed a close cooperative relationship, and because there is less opposition from the left-wing front in the parliament, its political foundation is very solid. In theory, this newborn parliament has the possibility of long-term political development. However, with the degree of economic panic becoming increasingly dangerous and the number of unemployed workers increasing endlessly, with Germany now averaging one unemployed person for every ten people, what strategies and plans does the parliament have to save this panic? This is entirely related to the fate of the parliament in the future. (May 5th)</p>
<p>Various Agencies in the Provincial Capital of Hubei</p>
<h3>Forming a Temporary Flood Prevention Committee</h3>
<p>Upstream Floodwaters of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers Surge and Converge on Wuhan, Various Counties Gradually Declared Disaster Areas, Provincial Government Strictly Orders Flood Prevention, Headquarters Economic Committee Dispatches Personnel to Survey Jianghan Dike Works</p>
<h3>Establishment of Flood Prevention Committee</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Yangtze River water level in Wuhan continued to rise by nine inches on the 21st, reaching a water mark of four zhang and five chi, only one chi and six cun away from the highest riverbank. Moreover, the water level in Yichang upstream and in the Laohekou section of the Xiang River upstream is rising even more sharply, soon to surge eastward and converge with the waters of the Yangtze and Han Rivers. With the situation severe and action pressing, various agencies in the provincial capital held a temporary emergency meeting at the Construction Department at 10:00 AM this morning, resolving to: (1) Establish the Hubei Provincial Capital Temporary Flood Prevention Committee; (2) Appoint one representative and one flood prevention inspector from each of the following fifteen agencies and organizations: Provincial Party Headquarters, Department of Civil Affairs, Department of Finance, Department of Construction, Department of Education, Second Engineering Office of Jianghan Project, Provincial Security Department, Garrison Headquarters, Garrison District Headquarters, Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, Water Police Branch Bureau, Wuchang County Government, Wuchang County Chamber of Commerce, Wuchang Property Owners Association, and Good Samaritan Association; (3) Appoint the Engineering Office, Department of Construction, Flood Prevention Inspector, Department of Finance, Garrison Department, County Government, Public Security Bureau, Water Police Bureau, and County Chamber of Commerce as standing committee members, with the Department of Construction serving as chairman of the standing committee; (4) The Flood Prevention Committee will be divided into six groups: The first group will handle document and financial matters, with the Department of Construction as the director; the second group will handle engineering, materials, and transportation matters, with the Engineering Office as the director; the third group will handle civilian labor, drainage, and patrol matters, with the County Government as the director; the fourth group will handle security matters, with the Garrison Department as the director; the fifth group will handle investigation and transportation matters, with the Department of Construction as the director; and the sixth group will handle post-disaster relief matters, with the Department of Civil Affairs as the director; (5) The flood prevention range will be from Jinkou to Qingshan, divided into four sections: 1. Jinkou to Baiguan, 2. Baiguan to Wutai Gate, 3. Wutai Gate to Xiaxin River, 4. Xiaxin River to Qingshan. A station will be set up every ten li, with two people assigned to each station for patrols; (6) The location will be within the Department of Construction, and office work will begin on the 22nd. The Jinshui Dam, which is part of Wuchang and is related to the safety of the four counties of Wuchang, Jiayu, Xianning, and Puqi, collapsed yesterday. On the 31st, the provincial government specially telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report this, and also, because the dam was built under the supervision of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, strictly ordered the bureau to investigate the circumstances of the incident and properly arrange relief efforts. It also ordered the Wuchang County Magistrate to investigate and report the extent of the damage for verification and handling. After the collapse of the dam, Wuchang and other counties immediately became disaster areas. In addition, mountain floods in various counties erupted simultaneously. In Puqi County and Huangpi County, mountain floods entered the city, reaching depths of seven to eight chi. Together with Qichun and Qishui, several counties have already suffered disasters. With the memory of the disastrous precedent of the 20th year of the Republic, the provincial government has formulated six articles of temporary flood prevention measures for the entire province, which were issued to all counties with dikes on the 21st, ordering them to follow and implement them to ensure safety. The order states, "For the purpose of ordering and instructing: Hubei borders the Yangtze and Han Rivers, and its fate is tied to dikes. If repairs and defenses are not thorough, disaster is imminent. The unprecedented flood of the 20th year of the Republic has left us with unrepaired vitality to this day. Recalling the past fills us with horror. The provincial government has repeatedly ordered diligent water management repairs from late winter to early spring, and, as the flood season approaches, has again issued strict orders for expediting efforts. Although dike works in various locations have mostly been reported as completed, the water level is rising and the momentum is extremely steep. Flood protection work is of utmost importance. All flood prevention measures along the main dikes of the Yangtze and Han Rivers are being properly discussed with the central competent authorities. Before these measures are finalized and implemented, in addition to ordering the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to prepare materials to meet urgent needs, all municipal and county governments with dikes must supervise and urge all repair and defense agencies and gentry near the dikes to prepare for defense. I now list several articles of measures, which must be conscientiously followed and implemented based on local conditions. As for the branch dikes and people's embankments in various cities and counties, which have always been repaired and defended independently, district chiefs and Lianbao directors, etc., should be strictly ordered to supervise the dike gentry within their jurisdiction to be responsible for protecting the embankments. Materials should be purchased and stored during peacetime, and guards should be sent to patrol in dangerous areas. In case of danger on the slopes, gongs should be beaten to report alarms urgently, and crowds should be urged to intensify rescue efforts. Those who are negligent and derelict will be dealt with jointly with government officials. The measures are: (1) Dike sections should be divided and assigned to dike wardens to be responsible. The sections can be longer in areas with dense households, and shorter in areas with sparse households. Furthermore, the sections can be slightly longer for dikes that are strong, and shorter for dikes that are weak. One must not be constrained to be negligent. (2) If the water level has reached a dangerous level, or if a leak or other danger is found in a certain section, labor should be assigned by district to be responsible for patrols and rescues in shifts. Special attention should be paid during strong winds and rain and at night. If a major danger occurs in a certain section, the other sections should still cooperate and not sit idly by. (3) Weeds, bamboo, and trees on the inner side of the dike should be trimmed in advance to facilitate the discovery of rat holes, ant nests, and leaks for early prevention. (4) Nets outside the dike should be strictly prohibited when necessary. (5) Branches on both the inner and outer sides of the dike should be trimmed when necessary to prevent strong winds from uprooting the trunk and shaking the dike body. These branches can also be used as flood protection materials. (6) All local materials that can be used should be investigated in advance for use in emergencies. If the materials are valuable and cannot be returned after use, the value should be estimated for public apportionment and repayment afterwards. In the Hankou area, in addition to the flood prevention dike along the river, which has already begun construction with wood and earth, all dikes are also being defended with all their strength. The Changfeng Dike near Dajia Mountain is extremely dangerous due to the high water level in the river. It is in danger of collapsing in the event of wind and waves. The provincial government has ordered the dike engineering agencies to take preventive measures quickly, and has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering the troops stationed along the dike to assist in rescue operations at any time. Furthermore, the Zhanggong Dike is of utmost importance, and the municipal government has been specially ordered to protect it carefully to avoid danger."</p>
<h3>Surveying Upstream Dike Works</h3>
<p>The General Headquarters of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and the National Economic Commission dispatched Dike Work Survey Committee members Zhu Jiuying, Yang Dinghua, Xi Kang, and Zhang Chongji, who returned to Hankou after inspecting the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers. On the 21st, they specially submitted a report on the survey of the dike works to the Headquarters Economic Committee, the original text of which is as follows: "Regarding the report, in accordance with the order to survey the Jianghan dike works, your officials departed from Hankou towards the Xiang River on the 6th of the month, arrived at Shayang on the 10th, and briefly reported the survey situation in a true telegram. On the 12th, we transferred to Shashi, inspected the Wancheng People's Dike and various soil and stone projects along the two banks, and returned to Hankou on the 18th. In view of the continuous rain and the rising water level in recent days, with the Hankou water mark having reached 45 chi, less than 10 chi from the flood level of the 20th year of the Republic, and with the time pressing and flood prevention brooks no delay, your officials have reported on the urgent practical matters that need to be done now, based on the inspections: (1) Last year's dike repair labor relief project in Hubei Province was affected by bandits and communists, and the soil extraction was not very legal. As far as your officials have passed by this time, such as the Chang'an Embankment, Mapu Embankment, Yangzi River's Zou Wharf, and Liuhe Embankment along the Xiang River, the soil pits seen are all close to the dike foot, and the slope of the dike is relatively small, which is worrying. The various engineering offices should be required to uniformly check, estimate, fill, and widen the dikes by the end of June to avoid negligence. (2) The various Jianghan dikes all contain some sand, especially in the areas of Wuyoujiao, Fangjiawan, Dongting Temple, Maopu, and Laowan, where the sand content is the highest. The various engineering offices should quickly pave the surface of the dikes with more sand with good soil and tamp it firmly to prevent loosening. If there is no clay available nearby, the dike body should be raised and thickened to ensure stability. (3) Rat holes and ant nests are a major hazard to dike works. With the flood season approaching, the various engineering offices should urge residents to carefully search for and repair them. (4) The Liuhe Embankment and Xiaoyue Dike, which are handled by the Third Engineering Office, are not practical and take soil from the old embankment outside the dike, which is also inappropriate. The Jianggan situation should be quickly measured in detail, and the plan should be revised and handled. Furthermore, the Dongting Temple Dike, which is handled by the Sixth Engineering Office, has loose soil and cracks have appeared. It should be quickly thickened and tamped. (5) The Yangjiayue dry-laid stone project is quite sloppy and must quickly transport large stones, repaving and laying them firmly. (6) There are many sloppy places in the dikes handled by the Third Engineering Office and the Xindi Engineering Office. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau should quickly send capable personnel to these places to conduct detailed surveys and repairs. (7) This year, the stone works handled by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau are mostly dry-laid slope protection. Although this project is more economical than those previously handled, during the coming flood season, personnel working on the project should pay close attention. If boulders are impacted by waves or sink, they should be immediately filled and leveled. (8) According to your officials' observations on the 18th, the top of the Jinkou earth dam is only a few feet above the water surface, and the situation is extremely critical. Today, it was reported that it has collapsed. Although this earth dam is not within the scope of the gate project plan, it is of great importance to this year's agricultural production. If the farmland has not yet been submerged after the collapse, the situation should still be assessed and rescue efforts should be carried out at any cost. (9) All technical personnel of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and the various engineering offices should go to the dike to inspect the water level and command the defense during flood prevention. They must not be negligent. (10) Each engineering office should prepare a type of insurance form, distribute it to the people along the dike, and immediately fill in and report the location of the danger to request rescue. (11) The Jianghan Engineering Bureau should first prepare 200,000 sacks and send them to the various engineering offices for use. (12) The various engineering offices should stockpile earthen mounds in important sections and add rubble, stone, firewood, and other flood prevention materials in dangerous places by the end of June. (13) Although flood prevention this year has already been started by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the responsibility for recruiting labor and collecting materials rests with the county magistrate. The county magistrates of each county should be telegraphed to quickly inspect the entire dike, survey, and arrange it with the directors of the various engineering offices before flood prevention. They must not shirk responsibility. The above points have been reported to the directors of the various engineering offices and the county magistrates of each county during the recent inspection, and have been sent to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau for inspection. Jiang Jiuying, Yang Dinghua, Xi Kang, and Zhang Chongji urgently and preliminarily report the situation to your department for review and approval, and order the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to comply. Your officials intend to inspect the Wuhan flood prevention project in one or two days, and then travel downstream to survey and report together. Respectfully submitted to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Director of the Economic Commission Preparatory Office Qin, Commissioners Zhu Jiuying, Yang Dinghua, Xi Kang, and Zhang Chongji (21st)"</p>

<h3>Qianjiang River Water Level Surge</h3>
<p>Tonglu and Jiande Counties and Cities: Water Inundates</p>
<p>North Bank Sandy Land Eroded Approximately 100 Acres</p>
<p>Hangzhou-Jiangshan and Hangzhou-Fuyang Roads Transportation Affected</p>
<p>Hangzhou News: The upstream area of the Qianjiang River is experiencing rapid currents. Due to continuous rainfall in recent days, the river has risen significantly. Counties along the river such as Tonglu, Jiande, and Lanxi have experienced flooding in their streets and markets, resulting in a disastrous situation. As of the 21st, the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan and Hangzhou-Haiyan sections of the embankment had not shown any signs of danger. However, the sandy land on the north bank of Hangzhou has been partially eroded, posing a significant threat to the embankment. A record of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the report from the Qianjiang Embankment Engineering Office to the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, after several days of continuous rain, the water level of the Qianjiang River has risen sharply from about four meters to about eight meters. The most severe surges occurred on the 18th at 6.5 meters at 6:00 AM and 6.9 meters at 6:00 PM, on the 19th at 6.95 meters at 6:00 AM and 7.1 meters at 6:00 PM, and on the 21st at 7.9 meters, with a continuing upward trend. If the rainfall continues, floods are bound to occur upstream. However, the Hangzhou-Haiyan and Shaoxing-Xiaoshan sections of the seawall have not shown any signs of danger.</p>
<p>The Ninth District Chief, Zhu Kongshuang, reported to the Municipal Government that due to continuous rain, the Qianjiang River water level had surged, causing the rapid flow to move northward. The sandy land outside the embankment in the district was completely submerged. The sand protection dams from No. 94 to No. 100 were all broken, losing their water-blocking function. The sandy land on both sides has caved in. If urgent measures are not taken, or if there is more continuous rain, it will endanger the embankment. In addition to the district chief advising farmers to build temporary earthen dikes to block the river water, an urgent telegram has been sent, requesting investigation and action, etc. After receiving the report, the Hangzhou Municipal Government sent Tang Chao, the chief of the Social Affairs Section, Wang Jingying of the Public Works Section, technician Wu Yin, and Li Kuan, an engineer from the Waterworks, to inspect the situation. According to their report, they went to inspect the water level of the Qianjiang River and the condition of the stone embankment this morning, accompanied by local resident Xu Hefu and staff from the Ninth District Office, from Guanyintang to Wulongmiao and then to Muqiaotou. The current water level of the Qianjiang River is at seven-tenths. Because it is low tide, although the mountain water is high, the river water has not yet reached the base of the embankment. If the rain does not stop, in three days, the tide will arrive, and the mountain water and the tide will combine, and the river water will inevitably flood and submerge the embankment. The first stone embankment in the city area, from Erliangting to Datongqiao for about two li, is the lowest section of the embankment, and the section around Ya'ertan for about twenty zhang is the weakest. It was in danger twice in 1925. If water invades the embankment this time, there will be a need for rescue and protection. However, this matter is of great importance, and it seems that the Water Conservancy Department should be notified to pay special attention. As for the destruction of the dams and the collapse of the sandy land, it is impossible to save them at this time when the river water is vast. It can only be discussed after the water recedes. In addition to the Public Works Section sending workers to repair the defects on the surface of the embankment in the Ya'ertan section, a special report is submitted for review.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has ordered the sections to transport the sandbags and wooden stakes for flood prevention, which were stored in the waterworks last year, to dangerous locations to immediately repair any breaches when they occur. It is reported that about one hundred acres of sandy land in the Guanyintang, Muqiaotou, and Xiaoqiaotou areas have been eroded in succession this time.</p>
<p>According to Jin Shixuan, the chief of the Transportation Section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, the section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway from Jianshan to Shipu is slightly dangerous. The bureau has sent engineering personnel to guard it day and night, and it should not cause any problems. As for highways, the Hangzhou-Fuyang Road, due to the rising water level of the Qianjiang River, passenger cars can only travel to Lingjiaqiao in Hangzhou County from the 21st, and any further travel is blocked by water. The Jingqiao bridge base on the Hangzhou-Yuqian Road is damaged, and vehicles passing through may be in danger. Passengers traveling back and forth must get off and walk across the bridge. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in the Haining section is still open to traffic. Although the road surface near Changxing on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is flooded by several feet, traffic is still barely maintained to avoid traffic interruption, etc.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province's Three Rivers Flood</h3>
<p>Rice Fields Submerged, Cities Flooded Several Feet Deep</p>
<p>Marketplaces Relocated, Canton-Sanshui Railway Suspended for a Day</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the beginning of spring this year, all counties in Guangdong Province have reported drought, especially the counties under the jurisdiction of the East River. The fields are cracked, and seedlings cannot be transplanted. The drought is evident, and various groups have repeatedly telegraphed the province for relief. Unexpectedly, after all hopes for early rice were lost, as summer approached, torrential waters rushed in. Rainstorms and flash floods occurred. In the low-lying areas of counties in the upper reaches of the East River, such as Heyuan and Zijin, the water flooded. In a certain township in Zijin, many houses collapsed due to sudden flash floods. Due to the flooding, public buses were suspended on various highways near the upper reaches of the East River. The current of the East River is rapid, and boats capsizing on the river surface are frequently heard. In the middle of this month, mountain floods in the North River also broke out. The river water rose sharply, suddenly increasing by fifteen or sixteen feet. Streets in the southwest gate of Qingyuan County were flooded. Since the 12th, there has been heavy rain. The water depth on the upper and lower Guo roads in the city exceeded two chi, and the water reached nearly four chi below Kangwang Temple in the lower Guo, making it extremely inconvenient to travel. Pedestrians used boats as transportation. Small boats on the river hurried to avoid the rapids. Ferry fares across the river increased three times compared to normal times. By the 14th, the North River had surged down. The areas that bore the brunt were the counties and towns north of Panyu, (i.e., the towns north of Panyu County). Gaotang and Jiangcun in the north of Panyu are located south of Qingyuan. The two places are adjacent to each other, facing the river and in a low-lying area. For a time, the North River could not be discharged in time. The water on the plains of the two towns reached shin-deep. The rice fields near Jiangcun were all flooded, with about six or seven-tenths submerged in water. Even in Shijing Township near Guangzhou City, five or six-tenths of the fields were flooded. From a distance, it looked like a vast expanse of water. As for the West River, the recent rise of the West River is even more worrying than that of the Northeast River. Since the 12th of this month, the streets of Sanhui Hekou have become a swamp, with water depth on the roads of about two chi. Shops are preparing to move to avoid the water. On that day, the Canton-Sanshui railway foundation below Sanshui was washed away and could not be used. Later, the Railway Bureau sent personnel to divert the water and rebuild the road foundation, and traffic was restored the next day. In Foshan City downstream, the Niu Lan Kou in Fuwen Li was knee-deep, and other places such as Xizhu Street were about three chi deep. More than twenty streets have built pontoon bridges for people to travel back and forth. In recent days, the West River has continued to rise, and floods seem to have formed. Since the 12th, Shiwanshi in the tenth district of Nanhai County near Foshan City has been flooded to the abdomen. Shops on the left street of the Gaomiao Temple have moved to high ground to operate, becoming a temporary marketplace. In addition, Daliangwei in the seventh district of the county has been completely flooded. Nearby, such as Sha Village, Li Bian Village, He Cun Village, etc., eight or nine-tenths of the rice fields have been flooded, and there is no hope for the early rice harvest. Farmers are complaining incessantly. (15th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A Painter Commits Suicide After Being Jilted</p>
<p>Zhang Gensheng, the owner of a paint shop in the east market of Huayang Bridge, died of illness in November last year. His wife, Madam Wang, a middle-aged woman, still possesses charm. Unable to endure loneliness, she developed an affair with Zhang Jinsheng, a shop assistant. The two lived together like husband and wife. However, as time passed, their love gradually waned. In recent months, they often quarreled, accusing Madam Wang of having an affair with another apprentice. Although Madam Wang strongly denied it, he refused to believe her. Yesterday (the 21st), another conflict broke out. Fearing that a tragedy would occur, the neighbors reported it to the police station, who summoned both parties for persuasion. Zhang Jinsheng signed a pledge to mend his ways and was released. That night, he stayed elsewhere. At dawn, he bought a razor blade somewhere, brought it to Madam Wang's bedroom, brought up the old matter again, and an argument ensued. The shop assistant Zhang Jinsheng pulled out the razor blade and slit his throat, killing himself. Zhang Genyun reported it to the court for inspection. The prosecutor's office immediately dispatched Prosecutor Zhu Zonghai with officials to examine the body and confirmed that he had committed suicide before death. Madam Wang still needs to be questioned and was released on bail for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Gamblers Assault Police and Rob Prisoners</p>
<p>The Wuxi Public Security Bureau's Supervisory Office received a secret report a few days ago stating that gambling was rampant in teahouses in Luoshe Town, the 16th district, and requested a swift arrest. After receiving the report, Chief Inspector Jin ordered Investigator Ma Deshan to lead thirteen police officers and nine undercover agents to go to the countryside by boat to investigate and arrest. They caught seven gamblers and a set of gambling equipment on the spot. While they were being taken away, a group of gamblers suddenly rioted, attacking and detaining Inspector Ma and the police officers. Another person broke the head of police officer Gao Mingzong with a large bowl. At that time, more and more villagers gathered, about five hundred people, and completely robbed the gamblers. The situation was extremely serious. Fortunately, merchants from the town came forward to mediate, and Inspector Ma and others were able to return to the bureau. They reported it to Director Wu for review. The injured police officer was sent to the county court prosecutor's office for examination, and Director Wu continued to send police officers to the countryside to arrest the fugitives and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Education Department Approves Exemption from Graduation Examination</p>
<p>The county's elementary school graduation examination was temporarily suspended due to the leakage of test questions, causing disputes, as previously reported. Education Director Wang Zhonglin submitted the details to the Education Department, along with the difficulties in rescheduling the examination. On the afternoon of the 20th, he received instructions from the Education Department stating that since it was claimed that rescheduling the examination would be difficult due to the end of the holiday and would affect admission to middle schools, the graduation examination for this year was approved to be waived. The bureau will send personnel to each school to strictly review the examination results, using the original school's grades as the graduation standard. Director Wang immediately instructed the principals to follow the instructions.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>South New Canal Completely Completed</p>
<p>Wuyi County dredged the South New Canal to facilitate transportation. The organizing committee was previously responsible for everything. Since the excavation began, it has been several months. The section from the canal entrance to Daijia Dam was first completed. Now, the section from Daijia Dam to Baitang Estuary has also been fully completed. The committee sent a letter to the county government to request acceptance of the project. The county government sent technical personnel to accept the project yesterday and requested that the Construction Department send personnel to Changzhou to inspect it.</p>
<h3>Two Bandits Captured in the Nineteenth District</h3>
<p>Yin Quan, the head of the eighth jia in Yinsha, the nineteenth district of Wuyi County, reported that a bandit named Zhang Jilin from Taixing, Jiangbei, was hiding in Yao Dexian's house. The jia head and others went to arrest him and sent him to the district regimental headquarters. In addition, the sixth jia also captured a bandit named Sun Jinshan (also known as Sun Da Mianzi) and sent him to the district regimental headquarters. After preliminary interrogation by Regiment Commander Xie, they both confessed to robbery. The bandits were transferred to the county government on the 21st for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Severe Floods in Four Rural Townships</p>
<p>From the afternoon of the 17th to the morning of the 20th, Xiaoshan experienced torrential rain for four days and nights, causing the water level in the inner rivers and outer rivers to rise sharply. Hundreds of thousands of mu of sandy land in the northern countryside were turned into a swamp. The number of houses and livestock washed away is unknown. In addition, the Qianjiang River current is rapid, and the West River embankment is low, with water already filling the embankment, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Residents outside the embankment have been continuously moving into the embankment in recent days. Fortunately, the early rice outside the southeastern gate has not been planted yet, so there is no major damage. However, there is no hope for the sandy land crops at all.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Bandits Plunder Yingzhuang Town</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM on the 17th, the fourth district of Gaoyou County, Yingzhuang Town, was suddenly attacked by forty to fifty bandits speaking the Gao Yao dialect, armed with guns, weapons and broadswords. They ransacked dozens of homes of Zhuang residents such as Zheng Nianqi, Zheng Fugao, Zheng Fushou, Zheng Fuxiang, Zhao Ruifeng, Nie Zian, Sun Shaohai, Wei Baokang, Zhao Xu's, Li Xu's, etc. They also kidnapped Zheng Fugao, Zheng Laigouzi, and the daughter of Li Xu's. The victims have separately reported to the county government, requesting the dispatch of personnel to suppress the bandits and strict apprehension.</p>

<h3>The Rising Jiang River Water Level has Shown Signs of Easing</h3>
<p>The National Economic Commission received a telegram from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau yesterday morning at 9:00 AM reporting that the weather in Hankou was clear yesterday and the water level was 45 feet 6 inches. It was checked that at 9:00 AM on the 21st, the water level in Hankou was 45 feet 1 inch, and it rose about 4 inches that night. The rising trend yesterday has shown signs of easing. If the weather continues to clear, it will not rise again, and people's hearts can be settled.</p>
<p>Bank Association</p>
<h3>Opposes Increasing Silver Prices</h3>
<p>The Dalu Bao reports that the Shanghai Chinese Bankers' Association telegraphed Song Ziwen, the chief representative of the London Economic Conference, yesterday, opposing the increase in silver prices, saying that China's silver reserves are only sufficient for domestic circulation. Once silver prices are raised, they will inevitably be shipped abroad one after another.</p>
<h3>Minting Decimal Silver Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>First Mint Single Jiao Overseas</p>
<p>Copper Coins Temporarily Remain the Same</p>
<p>Bank Association Opinions</p>
<p>The local banking industry association previously received an order from the Ministry of Finance to formulate opinions on the reform of silver subsidiary coins. After the association reported back to the Ministry of Finance, it suggested minting decimal silver subsidiary coins to unify the currency system. The Guowen News Agency reporter learned the following details yesterday:</p>
<h3>Minting Single Jiao</h3>
<p>According to the opinion submitted by the Bankers' Association to the Ministry of Finance, it is appropriate to first mint single jiao large foreign coins. The silver subsidiary coins are calculated in decimals, with ten coins equal to one large foreign dollar. This will avoid premiums and losses, unify the currency system, and curb market chaos. It is best to also mint five-cent silver subsidiary coins to facilitate use. However, whether to mint five-cent silver subsidiary coins is still under discussion. Subsequently, inferior small foreign coins and double haos will be gradually recalled, which can stabilize the market to a great extent.</p>
<h3>Copper Coins Remain the Same</h3>
<p>As for the chaotic price of copper coins, it is indeed related to the market situation. However, the opinion of the Bankers' Association is that if the copper coins are unified using the decimal system, it is feared that the general poor people will be greatly affected. The lives of the poor are mostly based on copper coin transactions. Once the copper coins are calculated in decimals to match silver coins, but the prices of goods traded with copper coins remain the same, the lives of the general poor people will be unsustainable. Therefore, the copper coin system will temporarily remain the same.</p>
<p>After the Implementation of the New Tax Rates</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Imported to China Decline</h3>
<p>The Japanese newspaper reports the report of Consul General Ishisha According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun dated June 14, the report of Consul General Ishisha in Shanghai states that the revised tariff rates of the Nanjing government have affected the Japanese goods market as follows: (1) The most affected are cotton fabrics, coal, cement, seafood, etc. Because the tariff has been increased for three years, the Chinese customs uses the gold unit system, and the boycott of Japanese goods has gradually made the Shanghai local cotton cloth processing industry developed, and the cotton products among the Japanese goods, which belong to the quantity tax, have been almost stopped from being imported. In 1930, it was 41 million customs taels, and in 1931, it decreased by 5.5 million customs taels. Recently, due to the sharp drop in the yen price, the ad valorem tax items that were calculated to be profitable, such as printing and dyeing, have also become quantity tax items, resulting in an increase of 15 to 70 compared to the old tax rate, which makes imports even more difficult. (2) There are now more than seventy or eighty dyeing factories in Shanghai's cotton cloth processing factories, operated by Chinese, British and Japanese. There are also several places in Wuxi, Hankou, Wuhu, Ningbo, etc. In the future, China's cotton cloth processing industry will become more developed, and the future of Japanese goods exports is worrying. (3) Due to the boycott of Japanese goods, the import of seafood to Shanghai has dropped sharply. In 1932, it was 380,000 customs taels, less than 10% of the average year. If the anti-Japanese sentiment eases, sea cucumber, dried scallops, squid, salted salmon, seaweed, abalone, shiitake mushrooms, etc., in Shanghai alone, will import 6 million customs taels, during which salted salmon is greatly affected by Chinese goods. (4) Paper products, such as newspaper, cigarette paper, glossy paper, wrapping paper, sulfuric acid paper, drawing paper, etc., increased by 30% to 56%, while the market price increased by about 20%. (5) Coal was 1.65 million tons in 1930, and only 150,000 tons in 1932, as was cement. (6) American timber increased by about 10%, while Japanese timber, except for railway sleepers, increased by more than 20% to 19.4%, resulting in Japanese timber not being able to compete with goods from Russia and the United States. Because of the anti-Japanese sentiment and the implementation of high tax rates, Japanese timber will inevitably be hit hard in the future. (7) The tax rate on electric bulbs has increased by about 100%, and it cannot compete with local products. Other items imported from Japan, such as galoshes, vulcanized dyes, and watch accessories, have also increased considerably. Among the miscellaneous goods, there are many that have been fatally hit.

<p>Will Return to Nanjing Tonight</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo visited Zhou Zuomin of Jin City Bank yesterday morning. In the afternoon, Wang Xiaolai was actually at the Albert Road selling military factories</p>
<h3>Please Maintain National Credit</h3>
<p>Loan Agreement Established Long Ago</p>
<p>People's Assets Should be Protected</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, regarding the rumor that the Shanghai Arsenal had been sold, which would hinder the association's loan sovereignty, specially sent a letter to Vice Minister Chen Gongxia of the Ministry of Military Affairs and Secretary-General Chu Minyi of the Executive Yuan to explain in detail and request that national credit be maintained. The original letter is recorded as follows: Vice Minister Gongxia and Secretary-General Minyi Jianjian, The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously stated that the Shanghai Arsenal had been sold due to the relocation of the factory. The factory site was already mortgaged for a loan in the spring of 1925, when the former General Chamber of Commerce provided a loan to dismiss soldiers and supply food and transportation. In May 1929, the Chamber of Commerce reported to the Ministry of Finance and received Public Letter No. 5032, approving the maintenance of the original plan. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance reported to the Executive Yuan and received instructions to proceed as planned, waiting for the Ministry of Military Affairs to be notified. If the factory building is sold, the proceeds should be used to repay the loan in advance to show great faith. On March 15, separate reports were submitted to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the factory be notified to comply. After two months, no approval was received, and another urging report was submitted. Later, the Ministry of Finance approved, stating that it had forwarded the letter to the Ministry of Military Affairs for verification and would respond after receipt. On the 16th of this month, the Ministry of Military Affairs approved it, stating, "I have received the letter. The Shanghai Arsenal is a central property under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. No local civil or military officials are allowed to dispose of it. The so-called mortgage for loan guarantee is an illegal disposition. The Ministry has the responsibility to manage it and cannot readily acknowledge it. I hereby notify you." The approval was deeply disconcerting. The factory property was approved to be mortgaged for a loan by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Land. At that time, the former Ministry of the Army also had a guarantee to the former General Chamber of Commerce, which can be verified. The Ministry's approval stated that the factory is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the former Ministry of the Army's mortgage for the loan guarantee was within its authority, without so-called illegal measures. Moreover, in May 1929, the Ministry of Finance reported to the Executive Yuan and approved the maintenance of the original plan, and there was a text for the Ministry of Military Affairs to be notified. All these circumstances are enough to prove the legality of the measures. According to law and reason, the former Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Land approved the original plan, and the Ministry of Land issued a guarantee letter. The loan agreement was legally established at this time. This matter is entirely a private law action, and both parties are in an equal relationship. The original plan cannot be overturned unilaterally with a single order. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the domestic debts borrowed by the old government were close to 200 million, all guaranteed by tariffs. In recent years, the national treasury has relied on tariffs as a major source of income. However, the government has maintained the original plan and continued to fulfill the repayment of principal and interest, without him. The national trust cannot be ruined, and the people's assets should be protected. The loan of the factory property was used for the dismissal of defeated soldiers and the pacification of the local area during the Qi-Lu wars. At that time, in order to protect Shanghai, the Chamber of Commerce forgot its triviality and borrowed from various industries, piecemeal, and fortunately there was no fall. For ten years, the principal has had no results, and the interest has been suspended in vain. Compared with domestic bonds, which are mostly discounted and mortgaged for cash, and have been repaying principal in installments and paying interest on schedule, the difference between them is more than a bad one. The creditors are eagerly waiting, hoping that once the factory property is sold, the principal and interest will not be lost. Now, as the Ministry shows, it is equivalent to canceling the national guaranteed debt with a light stroke. The result of the merchants' righteousness and eagerness to serve the public is equivalent to being confiscated by the government. Once this news spreads, the creditors will definitely make a big noise. The Chamber of Commerce is responsible for handling the matter and cannot stand aside. Xiao Lai is the head of the Chamber of Commerce. If the public sues in court, the liquidation of assets will not be enough to compensate, let alone there is no property to be broken. Once this precedent is set, who will dare to step forward to take on the government's urgent needs? The government's reason for governing a country is law and reason. If this is gone, the people will have nowhere to go. For the sake of the country and the Chamber of Commerce, I cannot help but offend the venerable and hope to move the clear hearing of the public. I do not know that the words are too straightforward. The various loan payments from the Chambers of Commerce in Hankou and other places have been settled by the National Government. The Shanghai Chamber takes care of the overall situation and supports public bonds. It takes the lead in helping people, and lags behind in settling its own debts. It has never made this a prerequisite for helping to raise debt. Now, it is intended to end with the words "not readily acknowledged." Those who sincerely support the country are punished for it. How can this show the country's transparency and harmony? In addition to the Chamber of Commerce preparing a formal submission to the case, I would like to respectfully ask for the show of great faith so that the text of the decree to maintain the original plan will not be lost. I hope for a long time,</p>
<p>The Ministry of Commerce and Trademark Bureau invited many bankers for consultation. Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, visited Chen at Albert Road at around 4:00 PM yesterday, talked for about 20 minutes, and then left. Chen has decided to take the night train back to Nanjing tonight.</p>
<h3>Crisis of Chinese-Owned Cotton Mills Not Yet Over</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn sales remain sluggish despite reduced work hours, inventory unmoved.</p>
<p>Resisting goods movement weakens the large-scale dumping of foreign cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Mills with 10,000 spindles must lose 500 yuan daily.</p>
<p>Those suspending operations account for 15% of the total.</p>
<p>Since the previous reduction in work hours, the cotton spinning industry initially thought that the difficult situation might be slightly alleviated. However, recent newspaper reports of mill shutdowns in various locations prompted a reporter from the New Voice News Agency to specifically interview a responsible person in the cotton industry, Mr. X, to inquire about the truth. The following was learned:</p>
<p>Before and After the Reduction in Work Hours: The previous resolution to reduce work hours was indeed due to the large amount of unsold yarn, sluggish sales, financial stagnation, and difficult turnover. At the same time, raw materials were in short supply, prices were firm and high, and procurement was difficult. Therefore, a joint decision was made to implement a minimal reduction in work hours, hoping to slightly reduce the stock of yarn, stimulate sales, and reduce cotton consumption, so that the price gap between cotton and yarn would no longer widen. However, outsiders did not understand this and mistakenly believed that the mill's reduction in work hours was entirely for self-interest, which is a big mistake. In short, whether work hours are reduced or not, the mills have long been in a state of loss. Reducing work hours only increases the deficit and makes the loss even greater. However, reducing work hours can avoid financial stagnation and allow for slightly more flexible turnover. In addition, reducing work hours and production might prevent market prices from continuing to fall and prevent the price gap between raw materials and finished products from widening further. Unexpectedly, after the reduction in work hours, yarn sales remained sluggish, and the turnover of yarn was minimal. Although yarn sales in various places have occasionally picked up in the past month or two, the resistance movement has weakened, and foreign cotton yarn transactions have flourished, resulting in Chinese cotton yarn still having few outlets. Recently, although Minister Sung's move to borrow money in the United States to purchase cotton has slightly calmed the rising price of cotton, the drop in yarn prices has exceeded it by several times. According to the closing prices on April 22 before the reduction in work hours, standard yarn was 186.1 yuan per unit, and standard cotton was 41.6 yuan. On the last weekend of this month, June 17, the closing prices were 186.2 yuan for standard yarn and 46.9 yuan for standard cotton. Comparing the two, yarn rose by 0.1 yuan, while cotton rose by 5.3 yuan. Calculating that three dan of cotton are used to produce one bale of yarn, it would result in a loss of 15.9 yuan. Before the reduction in work hours, mills were already losing more than 10 yuan per bale of cotton yarn, and now with an additional 15 or 16 yuan, it is naturally impossible for mills to maintain operations. Assuming a loss of 25 yuan per bale, a mill with 10,000 spindles, producing 20 bales of yarn per day, would lose 500 yuan. The actual situation is even worse than this. How can they sustain such losses? Reports of shutdowns have therefore begun to appear in newspapers one after another.</p>
<p>The Crisis Is Not Over: However, the mills are well aware that foreign competition must be resisted and the livelihood of workers must be maintained. Therefore, although business conditions are deteriorating daily, they are still struggling to survive. However, mills with weaker financial resources do not have the ability to support themselves and have declared shutdowns one after another. In the past, they still thought of struggling and hoped that the environment would improve slightly. Currently, this hope has become a bubble. At the same time, financial resources are also under heavy pressure, making it difficult to struggle. They are already nearing their limits. Therefore, those that have already suspended operations are mills with the weakest resistance capabilities. If the current situation continues to prolong, then those with stronger resistance capabilities will also shut down due to the financial inability to withstand losses. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>Shutdown Survey: According to a survey, the Chinese mills that have now completely suspended operations include Jingdu in Hankou and others in various ports, totaling approximately 11 mills, with 340,000 spindles. Three mills have suspended night shifts, totaling 100,000 spindles. Therefore, counting those completely shut down, it amounts to approximately 400,000 spindles, accounting for approximately 15% of the total number of spindles in Chinese mills.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Highway Loan Contract Signed</h3>
<p>No need to pay off the loan all at once.</p>
<p>The Highway Bureau will use it in installments.</p>
<p>Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, urgently needs funds to build highways. He has specifically used 500,000 yuan in treasury bonds to borrow 320,000 yuan in cash from the China, Jiaotong, Nonggong, and Difang four banks and pledged the operating income of completed roads to repay the principal and interest in full within 20 months. Chen Ticheng and Wang Guohua, important members of the department, were sent to Shanghai to negotiate several times. The procedures are complete, and a draft contract has also been drawn up. The formal contract was originally scheduled to be signed last week but was delayed due to the need to report to the provincial government. It is now known that the loan contract, totaling six copies, has been prepared and has been submitted to the Provincial Committee by the directors of the Construction and Finance Departments and passed. The directors of the Construction and Finance Departments have formally signed it, and the China, Jiaotong, and four banks have also signed it separately. The loan is now officially established. However, it is reported that there is no need to pay off the loan all at once. The Highway Bureau will use it in installments.</p>
<h3>Liu Buguang to Go to Hong Kong to Welcome Li Du</h3>
<p>Wang Ziyao Changes Flight to Singapore to the 27th</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Piguang, the representative of General Li Du stationed in Shanghai, recently went to Beijing to report to the central government that General Li was about to return to the country. He completed his official business the night before last and took the night train back to Shanghai, arriving in port at approximately 8:00 a.m. yesterday. He is scheduled to take a ship to Hong Kong at the beginning of next month to welcome General Li. According to Liu, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, Mr. Wang Ziyao was originally scheduled to fly to Singapore on the Euro-Asia plane on the 20th. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, he did not travel and changed the flight to the 27th on the Euro-Asia plane to inspect the troops stationed in Singapore on behalf of General Li. General Li caught a cold in Russia, which led to a case of tilted mouth corners. He went to Berlin for treatment and has now recovered. Ms. Xie Yiqing, General Li's wife, is still in Shanghai, waiting for General Li to return.</p>
<p>Party Department Opposes</p>
<h3>Tax Increase on Extra Land</h3>
<p>-A Painful Discussion of Five Unacceptable Reasons-</p>
<p>Speaking out for the Farmers of the Entire City</p>
<p>Submitting to Higher Levels to Request Exemption from Payment</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, the Land Bureau of this city is issuing land licenses in order for land that has been cleared in the urban area. However, if the measured area of land is larger than the original area recorded during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, a tax increase must be paid before the license can be obtained. In general, 80% to 90% of the land requires a tax increase. The average price to be paid for the tax increase is approximately 50 yuan per household, which is a sudden heavy burden, and the farmers are all crying out in pain. The Ninth District and Ninth Branch of this city, in addition to appealing to the Municipal Rural Revitalization Committee, have also petitioned the Ninth District Party Department to forward the petition to the Municipal Party Department and then to the Municipal Government, ordering the Land Bureau to exempt the farmers' extra land from payment and tax increase. The petition states: "Submitting a petition to request the Municipal Department to forward it to the Municipal Government, ordering the Land Bureau to exempt farmers from payment and tax increase for extra land when obtaining land licenses, in order to alleviate the farmers' difficulties and appease the people's feelings. The Land Bureau of this city is issuing land licenses in areas where land has been cleared. However, if the measured area of land is larger than the original area recorded during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, a tax increase must be paid. Otherwise, the extra land will be confiscated. This is a sudden heavy burden on the farmers, and they have no way to appeal. The sub-department is located in an agricultural area, and we feel the pain more acutely. Seeing the devastation of the rural areas, we lament the damage to the foundation of the country. Hearing the voices of complaint everywhere, we are alarmed by the loss of people's hearts. Regarding this new policy, we are deeply concerned. We believe that there are five reasons why it is unacceptable: The extra land requires a tax increase, but there is no compensation for the missing land. The people only have the obligation to pay the tax increase, and they have no right to compensation. For example, if one mu of land is extra in location A, 100 yuan must be paid to increase the tax. If one mu of land is missing in location B, there is no compensation. This is extremely unfair. It is estimated that the income from tax increases in this city will be more than 5 million yuan. Taking it from landowners in the north and south urban areas is not too objectionable from the perspective of the Principle of People's Livelihood. However, if the rural areas suddenly bear this huge amount of millions, it will be like draining the pond to catch all the fish, and the people will not be able to make a living. This is the first reason why the unequal rights and obligations of the tax increase should be exempted. The price to be paid for the tax increase is based on the land price. However, the land price in this city is not reported by the people themselves but is only estimated by the government. Even in its estimate, what method and standard are used is unknown to the people. As a result, some land that is actually worth 300 to 400 yuan per mu is estimated to be 100 yuan, while some land that is actually worth less than 100 yuan is estimated to be 400 to 500 yuan. Since the estimated price is inaccurate, it is even more unfair to rely on it to pay the tax increase. This is the second reason why the unfair payment of the tax increase should be exempted. Issuing licenses and increasing taxes requires payment within a limited time. The government has a way to collect it, but the people are unable to provide it. At a time when the rural economy is declining, it goes without saying that tenant farmers cannot maintain their livelihoods. Even self-cultivating farmers, with a family of five and ten mu of land, find it difficult to support themselves. The net profit of cultivating each mu of land is no more than 10 yuan per year, and there is no income in bad years. Living expenses cannot be met, and hunger and cold are inevitable. If this family of ten mu has one mu of extra land, and the price of this one mu is estimated by the government to be 500 yuan, then it will be necessary to use five years of income to pay the price of this one mu tax increase. Depriving farmers of their livelihood to enrich the government's income is not only unreasonable but also intolerable to human sentiment. This is the third reason why it should be exempted from the perspective of harming the rural economy. Moreover, clearing land and issuing licenses is nothing more than for the sake of tidying up the land. However, because farmers are unable to pay the tax increase, most of them have turned in their old licenses, and they have not received new licenses, which makes the state of rights unclear. To this day, the Land Bureau has been issuing licenses for a long time, and the area has been vast. However, if we examine the exact number of farmers who have received licenses, I am afraid that there are not even two or three out of ten. For the sake of their own rights, farmers naturally do not want to wait and see, but because they are unable to pay the tax increase, they have no licenses to receive and can only sigh in despair. This is the fourth reason why it should be exempted from the perspective of tidying up the land. Furthermore, the essence of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's equalization of land ownership lies in enabling those who cultivate the land to own it. In other words, it is to make the land owned by the farmers. To force a tax increase on land that belongs to the farmers, and to confiscate the land if they are unable to pay, is to deprive the cultivators of their land. It is the government competing with the farmers for profits. It violates the principles of our party, and there is no way to defend it. If Dr. Sun Yat-sen knew, he would not rest in peace. This is the fifth reason why it should be exempted from the perspective of the equalization of land ownership. In summary, the above five points are sufficient to show that farmers' extra land should be exempted from the tax increase. It is reasonable and justifiable. Moreover, the central government is now committed to revitalizing the rural areas, and the whole country is rising to the occasion. This city, as a leading area, should take the lead in the revitalization movement. How can we bear to impose a heavy burden and destroy the rural economy and deprive farmers of their livelihoods by forcing them to increase taxes? The sub-department adheres to the essence of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of equalization of land ownership and takes into account the central government's intention to revitalize the rural areas. We hereby speak out for the farmers of the entire city. The 20th Party Congress has resolved to submit a petition to the Municipal Department to forward it to the Municipal Government, ordering the Land Bureau to exempt farmers from tax increase for extra mu when receiving land licenses, in order to alleviate the farmers' difficulties and appease the people's feelings. We are truly grateful for the party's convenience. The Ninth District and Ninth Branch have already represented the voice of the farmers, appealing for the farmers and pleading for the people's lives. We believe that the responsible party and government authorities will have a way to alleviate the farmers' difficulties and appease the people's feelings. May our farmer friends in the city quietly await the breakthrough of this difficult situation."</p>

<p>Zhou Qigang Talks About Overseas Compatriots</p>
<h3>Decrease of Two to Three Million Over the Years</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Has Established a Relief Plan</p>
<p>Zhou Qigang, Director of the Central Overseas Party Affairs Committee and Vice Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, recently came to Shanghai on the night train the day before yesterday to personally welcome He Linyuan, Chen Mengyu, Huang Hunxing, and other representatives from the Cuban General Branch of the Kuomintang, who came to Shanghai from the United States. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed him at his residence. According to him, his mission this time, in addition to welcoming the representatives of the Cuban General Branch, is also to meet with the distressed overseas Chinese comrades in Mexico. Although the government does not have accurate statistics on overseas Chinese, according to past reports from abroad, 20 years ago, there were 10 million to 12 million overseas Chinese worldwide. In the past 20 years, (1) due to the stagnation of the world economy, (2) the decline of national power, and (3) the restrictions on immigration laws in foreign countries, the number of overseas Chinese has gradually decreased. The recent total number is no more than 9 million to 10 million, with the most in Nanyang, followed by North and South America, and then Europe, Australia, and other places. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has now formulated a new plan to relieve unemployment for all overseas compatriots, which has been approved by the entire committee. Only textual modifications remain. Once the revisions are completed, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the central government for implementation. The content of the plan is roughly divided into two parts: domestic and overseas. The full text is quite detailed. Before it is submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion, it is temporarily inconvenient to publish it.</p>
<p>Seventh Group</p>
<h3>Distressed Overseas Chinese in Mexico Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Approximately 120 overseas Chinese who were expelled from Mexico in the seventh batch will return to China. It was previously reported that they would take the President Harrison, which would arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of this month. However, due to insufficient third-class cabins on that ship, they have taken the President Jackson instead, which will arrive in Shanghai tonight. The Mexican Overseas Chinese Relief Association and the Global Overseas Chinese General Association have signed a temporary boarding pass with the Jianghai Customs yesterday. At that time, Huang Zhulin, Fang Difan, Lin Wenli, Chen Hanbin, Lin Huiyao, and other five representatives will be sent to board the ship to welcome them. Several other representatives will be sent to the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong to meet them. At the same time, they are still assuming the place at the New New Dance Hall to provide large-scale hospitality. At the same time, they will register the distressed overseas Chinese. Except for ten people who will stay in Shanghai to assist the Mexican Overseas Chinese Relief Association, the rest will take the original ship to Hong Kong and return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>New Commissioner's Office Staff</p>
<h3>Come to Shanghai to Await Ship Departure</h3>
<p>Zhang Wen, Director of the Transportation Team of the Xinjiang Commissioner's Office, came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday with Zhang Peizhe, a staff member of the Commissioner's Office, to complete the procedures for going to Xinjiang. According to Zhang, after Commissioner Huang arrives in Xinjiang, Ma Zhongying's troops are expected to be resolved immediately. Once the Russian ship arrives in Shanghai, we will lead the transportation personnel and Commissioner Huang's guards, totaling more than 20 people, to Xinjiang via Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Prepares to Hold Congress</h3>
<p>More Than 100 Groups Have Registered</p>
<p>More Than 200 Representatives Will Attend</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold its Fourth Congress of Members and Representatives at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th of this month. All preparations are being actively rushed. More than 100 public associations and store members have registered, with more than 200 representatives. Those who have not yet registered and paid their dues are also being urged by the Commercial Section to complete the payment of dues and the nomination of representatives before the 24th in order to attend the congress. The Secretariat has received 17 proposals from members as of the 22nd, which have all been submitted to the Proposal Review Committee for deliberation and then submitted to the congress for discussion one by one. Many of the proposals are very important, especially those related to tariffs.</p>
<p>Officers and Soldiers Suppressing Bandits</p>
<h3>300 People Pass Through Shanghai to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, a total of 296 officers and soldiers from the transport brigade of the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the 12th Division, 43rd Division, 59th Division, and 52nd Division of the 18th Army, who were lost in Yihuang, a bandit area, traveled through Ningdu, Ruijin, Huichang, Wuping, Jiaoling, and other places to Shantou. The Shantou Chamber of Commerce raised funds to purchase boat tickets to send them to Shanghai, arriving in port yesterday morning. The troops sent representative Li Xingwu to request the local authorities in this city to find a way to transport them to the Nanchang front. Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, sent personnel to take care of them and reported the information to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, which sent personnel to assist in the suppression. At the same time, they contacted the Two-Roads Administration. The 296 officers and soldiers were put on the Jinghu train at the South Station and returned to Beijing yesterday afternoon for further processing.</p>
<h3>Impact of Wuhan Floods on Passengers and Goods</h3>
<p>The disaster victims in Wuhan who were transferred to various places in Beijing and Shanghai in previous years were not able to return to their hometowns until the beginning of this spring. Unexpectedly, shortly after their return, there was another flood warning. Since the Yangtze River ship that left Wuhan the day before yesterday, the number of passengers taking ships from Hankou to Shanghai has suddenly increased, and they are carrying a lot of suitcases and large luggage. Most of these passengers are from the upper and middle classes, and they are sending their families and transferring their belongings east to prevent the floods.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Commercial Transportation. Goods Destined for Shanghai Diverted to Wuhan</h3>
<p>Goods destined for Wuhan and other places in Hunan and Hubei are all blocked and unable to be shipped due to the high water level of the Yangtze River. After the goods arrive in Wuhan, they cannot be transported and sold. Merchants who have goods stockpiled in Wuhan are afraid of the losses from the flood as they had in previous years. Therefore, the Yangtze River merchants have agreed to telegraph Shanghai to stop handling goods immediately. The six companies' Yangtze River exports have no goods to load. Goods going down the river from upstream also cannot be transported.</p>
<h3>Warehouses Waterproofing. Docks and Warehouses of Various Shipping Companies in Hankou</h3>
<p>The docks and warehouses of various shipping companies in Hankou are all located along the riverbank. Since the 21st, many places have been flooded. The shipping companies in this port, mindful of the events of previous years, telegraphed their branches in Hankou yesterday to urge customers to pick up their goods and ordered the cotton yarn, sugar, paper, paint, and seafood, which cannot be exposed to water, to be moved to the second and third floors of the warehouses within a limited time. They also added cement floodgates in front of each cargo to block the water when the river floods. Customers are also increasing their water damage insurance.</p>
<p>Problem of Collecting House Tax</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Denies No Longer Sending Personnel to Collect Taxes</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, issued a statement yesterday regarding the strike of shops on North Sichuan Road due to tax resistance: "The notice issued by the Citizens' Federation yesterday contained a section stating that 'Secretary-General Yu Hongjun met and explained the house tax issue. It seems that there is no guarantee before the construction of roads beyond the boundary is resolved, and it has been decided not to send personnel to collect taxes anymore.' When Senator Yu Qiaqing came to the office to negotiate on that day, I only told him that house taxes should be collected on roads built beyond the boundary. However, since the citizens there have stated the difficulties after the disaster, it has been decided to submit the issue to the next municipal meeting for discussion." The notice does not state the facts.</p>

<h3>Discuss the Status of Sino-Philippine Trade</h3>
<p>Wang States That the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Reception Had No Concrete Discussions</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou States That He Received a Letter of Thanks from the Delegation Yesterday</p>
<p>The Trade Bureau Also Had No Concrete Negotiations with the Delegation</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, since the Philippine Industrial Inspection Delegation returned to the Philippines after inspecting the commercial situation in Shanghai, there have been conflicting reports regarding the recent status of Sino-Philippine trade. Yesterday, reporters from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, and Ji Zejin, Director of Guidance of the International Trade Bureau, to inquire about the details. It is learned that since the delegation returned to the Philippines, there has been no concrete progress in Sino-Philippine trade. The remarks of the three are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Remarks</h3>
<p>A reporter from Guowen News Agency visited Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to inquire about Sino-Philippine trade after the Philippine Inspection Delegation returned to the country. According to Wang, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines in advance, so when the delegation came to Shanghai, it extended hospitality as the host. During the delegation's stay in Shanghai, its inspection of various commercial situations was quite detailed. However, regarding the recent status of Sino-Philippine trade after the delegation returned to the Philippines, there has been no news from them, so we do not know the details. Moreover, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce only had a brief discussion on the trade situation with the delegation and did not have any concrete measures, so there were no concrete results. It is said that the delegation intended to set up an office in Shanghai to develop trade. However, due to the difficulty of the Philippines' independence and other issues, it will not be implemented for a while.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou's Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, when the Philippine Inspection Delegation came to Shanghai, the Banking Association only joined other organizations to host the delegation once. The banking industry itself, in addition to talking with the delegation about developing exchange and trade, did not have any other concrete discussions. The delegation sent a letter to the association today (the 22nd) to thank us for the reception. When the reporter asked whether other banking circles had contacted the delegation, Lin said that he did not know whether there were other discussions in the banking sector.</p>
<h3>Ji Zejin's Remarks</h3>
<p>The reporter also asked Ji Zejin, Director of Guidance of the International Trade Bureau, who participated in welcoming the delegation, about the discussions between the bureau and the bandit inspection delegation. It is said that Chinese goods for trade with the Philippines are mainly meat, sausages, eggs, tea, etc. The discussions between the delegation and the Trade Bureau were to exchange opinions, and there were no concrete measures or results. As for since the delegation returned to the Philippines, the Trade Bureau has not received any news from them.</p>
<p>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Establishes</p>
<h3>Municipal Cooperative Experimental Zone</h3>
<p>Establishment Ceremony Scheduled</p>
<p>In order to develop the cooperative business in this city, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously petitioned the Municipal Government to prepare for the establishment of a cooperative experimental zone to promote it. The Municipal Government approved it, and the bureau immediately designated the Pingmin Residential Area on Xietu Road to plan the organization to reduce the living expenses of civilians. Cooperative societies such as consumption, production, and credit are set up in the area, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau allocates funds as share capital. It is now known that the area has been prepared, and the official establishment ceremony will be held on the first day (July 1) of this International Cooperative Movement Promotion Week. The ceremony is quite solemn. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has invited various agencies and public groups to attend the ceremony for guidance.</p>

<p>After Mediation by Personnel Sent by the Central Government</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Maigen Station Dispute Eases</h3>
<p>Loading and Unloading Fees Were Distributed at Maigen Station Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations abolished the Maigen Road Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative, the central government and the Railway Department sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate thoroughly. The loading and unloading branch of the famous station jointly provided assistance. Yesterday, the loading and unloading fees were issued to the workers at Maigen Station. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Conducting Mediation</h3>
<p>Li Wensheng, a representative of the loading and unloading branches of six stations, including Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Cao'e, and Ningbo, came to Shanghai to jointly ask for help from Li Renzhu, a special commissioner of the Central People's Movement Committee, and Guo Zhongxing, a special commissioner of the Railway Department. After the two special commissioners from the central government and the Railway Department completed their investigation yesterday, Guo Zhongxing of the Railway Department took the Jinghu train back to Beijing to report yesterday morning. However, Li Renzhu of the central government stayed in Shanghai to continue the mediation and seek an early resolution.</p>
<h3>Issuing Loading and Unloading Fees</h3>
<p>After the two special commissioners conducted mediation, the situation gradually eased. The loading and unloading workers at Maigen Road originally decided that if the Railway Administration still refused to use the name of the cooperative to receive loading and unloading fees on the 23rd, they would distribute the daily income themselves. Yesterday, Li Renzhu, a special commissioner of the central government, contacted the Railway Administration. At 3:30 p.m., Li Renzhu took the loading and unloading fees to the Maigen Road Station and distributed them to the workers.</p>
<h3>Railway Administration Explains</h3>
<p>The Two-Roads Administration announced that the administration had abolished the Maigen Road Station Cargo Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative on June 7 and handed it over to Yang Hengzhen to handle. The reasons and measures have been announced. The reason for the administration's abolition of the cooperative was its various violations. According to Article 36 of the regulations approved by the administration for the trial operation of the cooperative, the administration could abolish the cooperative and recruit workers for loading and unloading at any time. The reason for handing it over to Yang Hengzhen to handle was based on the Railway Department's method of contracting railway loading and unloading issued. Unfortunately, the leaders of the cooperative believed that restoring the contracting system violated the party's program and hindered the workers' livelihood and refused to hand over, resulting in a major dispute. Due to various rumors, many misunderstandings were caused. The administration believed that the issues related to the party's program and departmental regulations should be verified by higher-level agencies and requested the Railway Department to consult with the Central Party Department for a decision. The Railway Department has now sent Guo Zhongxing of the Labor Section of the General Affairs Department and Li Renzhu of the Workers' Section of the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Department to Shanghai to conduct a joint investigation. Once a report is made, there will be a solution. However, the administration has examined various opinions and believes that there are some points that need to be clarified to the colleagues of the Two-Roads so that they can understand the necessity of the administration's decision. Therefore, it has prepared answers to the questions raised by all parties and disclosed them.</p>
<h3>Workers' Response</h3>
<p>The unloading branch of Mai Gen Road, regarding the explanation published by the Railway Bureau in the daily newspapers of both railways yesterday, told the reporter of New Sound News Agency that the explanation was purely one-sided and contrary to the facts. They decided to publish a response today to avoid misunderstandings by all sectors of society. In addition, Central Special Commissioner Li Renzhu, fearing that the explanation published by the Railway Bureau would cause further misunderstandings regarding the possible peaceful resolution of the Mai Station dispute, specially advised the union not to respond yesterday.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Directors Held Yesterday by Two Railways Unions</h3>
<p>According to New News Agency, the unions of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways held their 46th meeting of directors at the union's meeting hall at 7:00 PM yesterday. Those present included Min Luoheng, Chen Bohua, Feng Qishu, Xue Jie, Dou Kexin, and Cai Lianghai. Representatives attending included Hua Shijun, Zhou Pengju, Li Xiangxiang, Wang Fengming, Hou Guanming, and five others from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Branch Office, and Chen Junpei and two others from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Branch Office. The meeting was chaired by Min Luoheng, with Han Dejun as the recorder. After formal greetings, the chairman reported on the situation of the petition to Beijing. Next, representative Xin Shijun reported on the progress of the salary increase movement. Chen Bohua reported on the recent salary payment situation at Mai Station, and Dou Kexin reported on the past situation of performance appraisal and salary increases. The discussion items followed: (1) The Ningbo-Shaoxing Section Branch Office submitted a request for clarification regarding the Railway Bureau's prohibition of non-official telegrams from being sent from stations. Resolution: (A) Request the Railway Bureau to notify all stations to handle matters as usual to facilitate union activities. (B) Reply to the section branch office to notify them, and instruct all branch offices and directly affiliated offices to comply accordingly. (2) The salary increase delegation telegraphed that the bureau's announcement of salary increase measures requires consideration. Resolution: Instruct the delegation of that branch office to provide detailed reasons for consideration (for submission to the Railway Bureau; the rest omitted).</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Criticizes Fish Industry Association for Not Filing and Orders Automatic Dissolution</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, since the establishment of the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region, things were initially peaceful. Subsequently, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Joint Association issued a declaration opposing the collection. The Da Gong News Agency reporter visited the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office yesterday to inquire about the office's response to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Joint Association. According to the Director of the Collection Office, Dai Yongtang, the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department Executive Committee had clearly criticized it and presented an official letter from the Chinese Nationalist Party Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, Ref. No. 1446, which stated, "In reply, your office's official letter No. 48 states, among other things, that Meng Lujiu, in collusion with Liu Tonghua and others claiming to be representatives of ice-fresh fish merchants in the city, illegally organized the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Joint Association to resist the collection of fisheries construction fees, and requested a strict ban on it. Upon approval, we find that Meng Lujiu and others previously came to the association and requested to organize the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Joint Association, which this association has already criticized and disapproved, and ordered automatic dissolution on file. We hereby reply accordingly, and hope you will take note and act accordingly. Respectfully, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Yi Xingbai, Standing Committee Members," The Party Department has already issued a clear ban, so the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Joint Association must have other backgrounds and is not a legal organization. Subsequently, the reporter visited the chairman and executive committee members of the Ice-Fresh Fish Merchant Association, who stated that none of the committee members of the association had joined this association, which was likely caused by a few fish merchants being exploited by others.</p>
<h3>Fish Industry Joint Association Resolves to Change Name</h3>
<p>Renamed Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Trade Association Shanghai Joint Office</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Joint Association has decided to change its name due to conflicts with legal organizational laws. A special meeting was held at its office on Sichuan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss this matter. More than 100 representatives of fish merchants from various places attended. Meng Lujiu was elected as chairman. First, the chairman reported on the progress of the matter. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (1) Proposal to send representatives to Beijing to petition. It was resolved that representatives would be sent to Beijing on a fixed date after the petition letter was revised. (2) Proposal to change the name of the association. It was resolved to automatically change the name to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Trade Association Shanghai Joint Office. (3) Proposal to re-prepare the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Joint Association. It was resolved to appoint Meng Lujiu, Mao Anqing, Liu Tonghua, Hu Zhiting, Le Baodong, Xia Zubin, Zhang Zhenfang, Chen Jiusong, Li Mingde, Wang Zuquan, Hong Jinrong, Chen Linfu, Yang Chouzeng, Zhang Zhisheng, Zhou Huixiang, Xu Shanxing, Weng Zhaofang, Zhou Liankui, Shao Maixing, Ge Weian, Xu Wusun, Zheng Zuchuan, and Chen Zuyu as preparatory committee members. (4) Proposal to distribute duties for the preparatory committee. It was resolved that Meng Lujiu and Mao Anqing would be the preparatory directors, Liu Tonghua and Zhou Huixiang would be in charge of general affairs, Zhang Zhisheng would be in charge of finance, Shao Maixing and Li Mingde would be in charge of organization, Zhang Zhenfang, Weng Zhaofang, Hu Zhiting, Yang Shouzeng, and Chen Zuyu would be in charge of publicity, and Xu Yusun would be the guide. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Prevents Epidemics</h3>
<p>Disinfection Implemented in Waterways of Qimei Road</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has always paid close attention to epidemic prevention. Even last year, despite the Shanghai War, epidemics did not spread. Regarding this year's epidemic prevention work, the bureau started as early as early May. Therefore, until today, cholera epidemics have not occurred. However, the Pasteur Institute (located on Avenue Edward VII) discovered cholera-like bacteria (a type of cholera-causing bacteria) in the waterways around Qimei Road in the Sajing Port. They immediately reported to the Municipal Health Bureau, which dispatched personnel to the area yesterday morning to take well water and river water back for testing and cultivation. After agglutination reaction tests, it was proven that there were indeed bacteria in the water. However, it was not confirmed whether they were cholera bacteria. To prevent problems before they arise, the bureau has instructed the disinfection team to immediately disinfect the river water and well water in the area.</p>
<h3>Enforcement of Arbitration Case of Sanyou Factory</h3>
<p>Capital Refuses Summons and Fails to Appear</p>
<p>Order Issued for Compulsory Enforcement</p>
<p>The labor-capital dispute of the Sanyou Industrial Society in Yinxiang Port, Pudong, has been finalized after three trials. The Supreme Court issued an order to the Shanghai Local Court to enforce the arbitration decision of the Municipal Government. After three summonses by the court, the capital has no room to resist the resolution of various items, but lacks sincerity in its implementation. For example, the call for shareholding and resumption of work is nowhere in sight. Even the 6,000+ yuan of food expenses that should be paid to the workers was ordered by the court to be paid in full within one month, but the capital also failed to do so by the deadline. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the enforcement period of the case arrived. Judge Lou Rong of the factory opened the 8th court to inquire. Labor representatives Zhang Yihai and Gong Yuting, and attorney Wei Wenhan appeared. Shen Jiucheng and Wang Xianhua, from the capital, failed to appear and were only represented by attorney Lei. The court considered the capital's attitude to be cunning and ordered that the portion of the food expenses be allowed to be transferred to the First Special District Court for assistance in compulsory enforcement. A notice was issued to the labor side and the attorney representing the capital was instructed to convey to the company负责人 to seek a resolution as soon as possible, otherwise compulsory enforcement would be very disadvantageous. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>After the assassination of Yang Xingfo, Director-General of the Academia Sinica, his body was encoffined the day before yesterday and temporarily placed in the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, awaiting selection of a burial site. According to Liao Xielin, Director of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica and Acting Director-General, the reporter for the Central News Agency said that Yang's burial site has now been selected in Yong'an Cemetery, but the location of the tomb and the date of burial have not been completely determined. There is still no news about the murderers of Yang.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Xin Renhe Wheel Tragedy</h3>
<p>Sun Xingsheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Other Defendants Receive Varying Sentences</p>
<p>-Second Comprador Chen Baosheng Transferred to Criminal Court-</p>
<p>The case of the Xin Renhe Wheel ship murder of Ma Kou, Zhou Datong, Wei Jinfu, Mei Laoer, and Sun Xinliang was previously reported, in which ship owner Sun Xingsheng, comprador Guo Xihou, and others were detained in the local court awaiting judgment. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Luo Renji, along with Prosecutor Zhang Zi and Clerk Wang, arrived at the First Tribunal to announce the verdict. Attorneys Shi Qinghua, Zhang Shibeng, Liu Shiqi, and others were present. Lawyers for the plaintiff were also present to hear the verdict, and the spectator seats were immediately crowded. Therefore, Chief Bailiff Chen Junfang, Sergeants Chen Xihui, Zhu Wenqing, and other county police officers maintained order and escorted the defendants. After bringing the defendants to the court, the judge first asked Sun Xingsheng, 44 years old, from Pudong, the ship owner; Guo Xihou, 61 years old, from Chongming, the comprador accountant; Lu Yonggeng, 53 years old, from Wuxi, the accountant; Feng Xingfa, 49 years old, from Ningbo, the tea server; Shen Chuanlang, from Chongming, the Western-style servant; Shen Xingqiao, 26 years old, from Shanghai, the sailor; Wang Mingda, 18 years old, from Qidong, the Western-style servant; Huang Fusheng, 46 years old, from Qidong, the sailor; Zhang Xiaoneng, 36 years old, from Haimen, the stoker; Feng Fusheng, 35 years old, from Haimen, the helmsman; Ye Yuanfu, 35 years old, from Ningbo, the tea server; Gao Jixing, 51 years old, from Yangzhou, the handyman; Gao Jiyu, 53 years old, from Yangzhou, the handyman leader; Liu Tingsheng, 24 years old, from Wuxi, the stoker; Wang Moqing, 36 years old, from Chongming, the second mate; Liu Maoda, 24 years old, from Changzhou, the stoker; Shi Fangguo, 54 years old, the handyman; Wang Xingjiang, 36 years old, from Chongming, the carpenter; Lu Yaozu, 32 years old, from Wuxi, the tea server; Zhang Yulin, 36 years old, from Haimen, the tea server; Wu Ruisheng, 28 years old, from Gaoqiao, the stoker; Gu Youshi, 23 years old, from Haimen, the Western-style servant; Liu Yongqing, 30 years old, from Wuhu, the cook. After each defendant stated their age and origin, the judge stood up and announced the verdict: Sun Xingsheng, for jointly premeditating murder, is sentenced to life imprisonment. Guo Xihou and Lu Yonggeng, for conspiring to murder, are each sentenced to ten years in prison. Feng Xingfa, Shen Chuanlang, Shen Xingqiao, Wang Mingda, Huang Fusheng, and Zhang Xiaozhang, for jointly premeditating murder, are each sentenced to twenty years in prison, all with deprivation of civil rights. Feng Fusheng, for conspiring to murder, is sentenced to two years in prison. Ye Yuanfu, Gao Jixing, Gao Jiyu, Liu Tingsheng, Wang Moqing, Liu Maoda, Shi Fangguo, Wang Xingjiang, Lu Yaozu, Zhang Baolin, Wu Ruisheng, Gu Youshi, and Liu Yongqing, thirteen people for conspiring to murder, are each sentenced to two years in prison. The sentences for Ye Yuanfu and the other thirteen people are suspended for three years. The number of days Guo Xihou and others have been detained awaiting trial will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. All defendants shall be jointly and severally liable to compensate the victims: Ma Chen's and Ma Jiaqing, 2,000 yuan; Mei You's, 2,000 yuan; Zhou Ma's, 2,000 yuan; Wei Zhu's, 2,000 yuan; and Shen Zhou's, 2,000 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan (the plaintiffs requested a total of 108,000+ yuan). After the announcement, the judge said to Sun Xingsheng, "Your sentence has been reduced by one-third to life imprisonment." He also said to Guo Xihou and others, "Your sentence has been leniently applied by changing the legal articles." He also said to Feng Xingfa and others, "Your sentences have been reduced by one-half, otherwise you would all be facing the death penalty. The circumstances of this case are understandable." Feng Fusheng was not granted a suspended sentence because he had committed a crime before. The remaining Ye Yuanfu and others were treated leniently because they were considered lower-level employees who blindly followed orders, and were therefore not reduced. He then ordered them to be taken back into custody to await separate disposition. In addition, Chen Baosheng, the second comprador who was recently arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was interrogated by the Third Division yesterday noon and transferred to the local court. Because the previous case has already been judged, the original prosecutor asked a few questions, and Chen also admitted that Wang Guanxian was entirely in charge. Therefore, the judge ordered strict detention, and then transferred the case back to the criminal court for another trial.</p>

<h3>Ninghe Difficulties, People Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>The pseudo-army in the Ninghe-Luanxian area has not yet withdrawn, committing rape, robbery, and devastation throughout the area. The World Red Swastika Society received a telegram from the Ninghe County Party Department yesterday, begging for relief. After receiving the telegram, the president of the society, Xiong Xiling, decided that since the pseudo-army had not completely withdrawn from the county, to continue to accept refugees in Tianjin until the appropriate time for relief, and telegraphed all Swastika societies and charitable organizations nationwide, appealing for the refugees. The text of the telegram received at the Shanghai General Office of the Society is recorded below for the reference of all Red Swastika Societies and charitable organizations: Yesterday, we received a telegram from the Ninghe County Party Department, which stated, "President Xiong, since the Yuguan Incident, the Japanese invaders have invaded westward. The people of Ninghe have supplied military rations, amounting to approximately 20 million, exhausting the people's resources. After the fall of Luanhe, the pseudo-army arrived, burning, looting, killing, and committing crimes. Young women are dying in large numbers. The widowed, the orphaned, and the lonely are displaced. The entire area is devastated, with nine out of ten houses empty. They are fierce and arbitrarily massacre, bombarding</p>
<p>with guns, and inflicting cruelty on the people. Killings result in buried bones and resentment, and rapes result in the loss of beautiful faces. Villages are in ruins, and markets are scorched earth. The number of refugees moving to other places is approximately 200,000. The sound of people crying for food is heard throughout Tianjin and Gu. They are emaciated and have yellow complexions. One cannot bear to see them. Driven by hunger and cold, they are already exchanging children and dismembering bones. We feel sorry for the elders, brothers, and sisters of Ninghe, who, after being bombarded by guns, are suffering from hardship and have no home to return to, no food to eat, no clothes to wear, and no house to live in. They live in the grass and sleep in the open air, exposed to the wind and rain. It is painful to speak of. It is heartbreaking to see. If relief is not provided urgently, we fear that 200,000 refugees in Ninghe will all become starving ghosts. Without the old or the young, without men or women, they will all turn into wronged souls. We deeply hope that you, sir, will uphold the spirit of universal love, provide immediate relief, and broadly provide assistance with a merciful morality, so that the 200,000 refugees in Ninghe can maintain their lives. This is what the people of Ninghe and our department are looking forward to." After investigating the disastrous situation in Ninghe, it is extremely pitiful. In addition to continuing to accept refugees and find ways to provide relief, our association specially telegraphed your esteemed association, urging you to consider the importance of post-disaster relief in the disaster area of North China, and generously provide continuous relief, so that those on the verge of death can celebrate their rebirth. This is the gift of the benevolent. Xiong Xiling, World Red Swastika Society, Ma."</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Relieves Impoverished Performers</h3>
<p>Distributes over 58,000 Catties of Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a quick letter from Peiping yesterday, stating that refugees are being assisted and post-war zones are being investigated. However, during the tense situation in Peiping, all theaters were closed, and the elderly, weak, and impoverished performers were at risk of starvation. Therefore, 58,900+ catties of millet were purchased and sent with Cheng Long, who is leading team members, to the Liyuan Guild Hall on Yingtao Xiejie, in front of which the distribution will take place. Each person can receive 40 catties of millet.</p>
<h3>Public Roads and Private Land Exempted from Grain Tax</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Shanghai County to Report Household Registers</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Magistrate received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, ordering that the private land used for the construction of public roads be surveyed and household registers be prepared with the amount of silver and rice exempted, and submitted to apply for grain exemption, and to report the names of the grain exemption road lines and the status of compliance. The original order stated, "It is necessary to survey and register the private land used for the construction of public roads, and to submit applications for exemption from grain tax. The Construction Department has repeatedly ordered counties to comply. It is found that many counties have complied, while others have not, which is not in line with the way of caring for the people. Therefore, the County Magistrate is ordered to survey the private land used for the construction of public roads, and to prepare registers of household acres and the amount of silver and rice to be exempted, and submit them for approval and exemption from grain tax, and to report the names of the grain exemption road lines and the status of compliance for record."</p>
<h3>Resolution of Water Cutoff Case in Qinyu Lane</h3>
<p>Disputes arose over the installation of water meters by the British Shanghai Waterworks Company. After Mr. Feng Bingnan mediated and tried a settlement method, water cutoff incidents occurred again in Qinyu Lane, Yuanfang Road, because prices were still rising and the water company was forcing a few users to sign contracts. After negotiations by the Real Estate Association, a result has been achieved. The letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Association to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company is recorded below: "Respectfully, according to a letter from our association member Qinyu Company, a tenant account stating that all of the company's properties located at No. 87 to No. 99 Qinyu Lane, Yuanfang Road, have rental fees included, at 30 yuan, 35 yuan, 50 yuan, and 10 yuan for the overpass, divided into four types of rental fees, removing 75% of the water fee, distributed in four shares, amounting to a rental fee of approximately 29 yuan per building. We received a notice from the British Waterworks, stating that the water bill for January to May 12 of this year was 278 yuan and 7 cents, and was paid in full as a proof of receipt, with no shortage of water fees. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>the water was forcibly cut off today, taking one step further and attempting to coerce the company into signing a new contract with them, otherwise the original supply would not be restored. We are attaching a copy of the water company's receipt and request that your association provide a remedy immediately, negotiate reasonably, and avoid unexpected accidents among the tenants due to the lack of drinking water. All risks and damages should be borne by the perpetrators. The water fee issue has just come to a close, and a trial method is being used to achieve a permanent resolution, with the establishment of a mixed committee to complete the matter. It is a pity that the committee has not yet been established. Unexpectedly, the issue of signing contracts has arisen again, and even the means of cutting off water have been used, which is deeply regrettable. Contracts are generally necessary in ordinary transactions, but in this type of public utility, the relationship and conditions between the water user and the water supplier have their own relevant</p>
<p>regulations. If the contract conditions are within these regulations, then signing a contract is superfluous and only leads to disputes. If it is outside the regulations, then it is legally invalid. Even if it is an ordinary transaction contract, signing under coercion is not recognized in law. Our association has a very simple analogy: riding a tram must be done according to the regulations of the responsible authority. Is it not laughable that the tram company and passengers must sign a contract? According to the previous letter, we respectfully request that you investigate and immediately restore the water supply, and refer all disputed points to the committee that should be established. The association has now received a reply from the British Shanghai Waterworks Company stating, "Respectfully, we received your letter of the 17th of this month regarding the supply of water to the rented houses of Qinyu Company at No. 87 to No. 99 Yuanfang Road. We are aware that this matter has been handled by several companies, and the supply was restored on the 14th of this month. We hereby reply respectfully, and hope you will forward it. This is the secretary and deputy manager of the Shanghai Real Estate Association, Walter."</p>
<h3>Mrs. Xia Jinlin Returns from Europe and America</h3>
<p>Mrs. Xia Jinlin, a member of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, traveled abroad last autumn, visiting various countries and traveling extensively in England, America, Geneva, Italy, and other places.

<h3>Free Water Supply Provided by Waterworks Company for Summer Epidemic Prevention and for the Poor</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Works Health Officer reported to the Health Committee that, at the request of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, he had obtained the consent of the Waterworks Company to continue the previous year's method of providing free water to poor residential areas that have not been equipped with water pipes during the hot season. The quantity is approximately the same as the supply provided last year. Last year, from July to mid-September, the company provided free water to the poor through street faucets in the eastern and western districts.</p>
<h3>Trial of Robbery Case Involving Over 120,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Two Thieves are Ferocious and Calm</p>
<p>Claiming that the Initial Purpose Was to Rob Land, Later Finding Out It Was Cash</p>
<p>The Judge Ordered 38,000 Yuan in Stolen Money to Be Returned to the Victims First</p>
<p>The robbery of 126,000 yuan that occurred at the entrance of Yonganfang on Yongan Street in the French Concession at 5:00 AM on the 16th has been solved by Superintendent Jin Jiulin and others from the special agency of the French police, who arrested the gang of thieves Xu Wu, Wang Maonv, and others, and sent them to court for interrogation and investigation. The ringleaders Li Along and Zhang Weicai fled to Jiaxing and were captured by the Jiaxing Public Security Bureau's Security Regiment in Room 34 of the Dadong Hotel. The French police sent detectives to transfer them to Shanghai, and went to</p>
<h3>Pull Up Stolen Cash in Pudong</h3>
<p>38,200 yuan in cash, etc., as detailed in the continuous reports. At 11:00 AM yesterday, the French police escorted the two thieves Li and Zhang, along with the stolen cash that was pulled up (wrapped in newspapers and placed in a new handbag), to the Second Special District Local Court, where Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing in Criminal Court 1. The police escorted the two thieves to the defendant's stand. Li was short in stature, with a thin, long scar on his left cheek, about an inch long. He was wearing a dark gray western-style cloth long gown, white silk stockings, and black leather shoes, with his hands tied behind his back and holding a new straw hat. Zhang was of medium height, wearing a gray worsted suit, white silk stockings, and yellow leather shoes, with his trousers tucked into his socks. Both of their faces were</p>
<h3>Ferocious and Frightening</h3>
<p>but their attitudes were unusually calm. The court first questioned Li, who said he was 39 years old, from Suzhou, and lived at No. 19 Fumin Road in the Chinese area, where he solicited passengers at the dock.

Questioning Xia Yongqi, He Confessed That the Plaintiff Knew That I Had a Wife When She Became My Concubine and That She Interacted With My Wife From Time to Time, And That There Was No Deceptive Behavior, etc. Judge Qian Examined the Agreement Submitted by the Plaintiff and Found That it Only Stated That He Lived With Wang and Would Never Fall in Love With Another Woman in the Future. If He Violated This Agreement, He Would Pay 5,000 Yuan in Alimony. Judge Qian Then Stated That According to the Words in the Agreement, It Could Only Prove That There Was a Cohabitation Relationship and Could Not Prove That the Defendant Had Deceived the Plaintiff Into Believing That There Was a Marital Relationship. He Ordered the Plaintiff to Provide Sufficient Evidence. Since Wang Huizhen Could Not Provide It, Judge Qian Declared to Both Parties That Since They Were Once in Love, Why Should They File a Lawsuit Over Trivial Matters? It Would Be Better to Reconcile. The Case Was Postponed for Retrial.</p>

Now, due to requests from all sectors to extend the exhibition, it has been extended for two days for public viewing.</p>
<p>Shi Naibo and Others Organize a Labor Theater Troupe. Nowadays, after work, laborers have no suitable recreational places to relax, which affects the country's population and social industry, preventing progress. There is no opportunity to express the lives of laborers, causing an absolute disconnect between ordinary laborers and society. The current so-called amusement parks and theaters often focus on consumption and easily tempt laborers to decline, which is not a good phenomenon. Now, labor members Shi Naibo, Zheng Weiying, Zhou Yiming, Zhang Guanghan, Gu Fengqi, and others, in view of this, have specially gathered comrades to initiate the organization of a labor theater troupe, with the aim of promoting appropriate entertainment for laborers. At the same time, they will use drama and art to express the true meaning of labor life, achieving two goals at once. It is truly perfect. It is said that they are currently soliciting initiators to draft regulations, internally dividing into drama, music, and dance departments, and temporarily borrowing the Hongzhong Woodware Industry Union outside Xiaonanmen as a preparatory address, actively proceeding, in order to establish the organization in the shortest possible time. They will also submit the application to the Municipal Party Department and the Education Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Station</h3>
<p>China-West Broadcasting Station Broadcasts "Women and the Family." Our country has never had anyone discuss or study women's issues and family issues. Therefore, the general public only knows about family burdens but not family happiness. Now, the China-West Great Western House Broadcasting Station, starting this week, has added a "Women and the Family" program, hiring Mr. Yao Sufeng, the editor of the "Women and the Family" column of the Chen Bao newspaper, as the director. Mr. Yao has hired several famous women and those interested in women's issues and family issues. Every Saturday from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM, they will broadcast lectures. It is said that more than a dozen lecturers have been hired.</p>

<h3>Conjecture on This Year's Yangtze River Water Level by Zhu Yong</h3>
<p>In recent days, the Yangtze River water level in Shanghai has been rising rapidly, which has attracted the attention of the public. Some argue that the high water level in Hankou this time is unprecedented for the same month since 1870, and that the unprecedented catastrophe of the great flood in 1931 will repeat itself. Learning from past mistakes can indeed prompt the authorities to pay attention, but judging from the facts, this is not necessarily the case. The rise and fall of the water level are originally due to the amount of rainfall, and the amount of rainfall is related to the change in weather. Based on the longest-standing records from countries around the world, we can infer the water level of each place and obtain a considerable cycle. For example, the damage caused by the Dambier River and the Saône River in France is seen every 400 years. The Taibo River in Italy suffered a flood disaster 375 years ago, but it has not been seen again to this day, which proves that water disasters are very unusual events. However, due to the lack of water management in China, occasional continuous rain can cause huge disasters. However, there seems to be a considerable cycle. However, detailed records have not been kept for a long time, and speculation is difficult. Records of the Yangtze River water level began in 1868 and have lasted for 65 years. In these 60-plus years, a high record seems to appear every ten years, such as 1931, 1921, 1911, 1901, 1889, and 1878. If we follow this example to speculate, there will not be a major flood this year. However, there are also reasons why we cannot rely on this as a conclusion, which will be discussed separately below.</p>
<p>The Importance of the Hankou Water Level. Hankou is located in the central part of the country, not only as a commercial center in the interior, but also as a hub for water levels along the river. Because of its location at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers, there are wide tributaries upstream. The Han River basin is north of the Yangtze River, with a smaller area and a narrower riverbed, so its rise is rapid and temporary. However, the Yangtze River has a long source and flows eastward, and once it rises, it is not easy to fall. However, whether it is the Yangtze or Han River, a sudden rise in one river is enough to raise the water level of Hankou. If the rise periods of the two rivers are different, they will flow into the Yangtze River one after another, and the water level of Hankou will not increase sharply. Otherwise, if the two rivers rise simultaneously, the water surface of the Yangtze River in Hankou will be even higher. This is one point.</p>
<p>Rainfall varies from year to year, but the discharge capacity of the riverbed is limited. If it exceeds this limit, it will inevitably overflow. However, lakes can be used to divert the flood and temporarily prevent disasters. Therefore, Yangtze River disasters in past dynasties were less severe than Yellow River disasters, because the Yangtze River has Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake to store water. In recent years, Poyang Lake has been silting up, and the Yangtze River can only rely on Dongting Lake as a place to discharge water. Now Dongting Lake is also becoming shallower day by day, and the water level of Hankou is becoming increasingly important. After the Yangtze River reaches Hankou, there is no way to divert the flood. If Hankou is flooded, all prosperous areas east of Hankou will suffer the risk of being submerged. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the rise and fall of the water level of Hankou are the focus of attention for foreign businessmen, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>An Overview of the Hankou Water Level Curve. According to the Hankou water level curve, there is usually a rise in May and June every year, which stops or slightly decreases in June and July, and then rises again in one or two weeks. The highest point is in August or late July. After this point, it will drop all the way until February of the following year, with no more sudden rises and falls.</p>
<p>Last year, the Hankou water level rose to 35 feet in late May and to 36 feet in early June, less than 2 feet different from the water level in the same period in 1931. After the people suffered great pain, they were all shocked and thought that the previous example would be followed and a great disaster was coming. Who knew that after this, it would drop day by day, falling to 32 feet in mid-June, and the highest water level in mid-August was only a little over 44 feet.</p>
<p>Conjecture on This Year's Hankou Water Level. Now, based on the past water level curves, we can infer this year's water level curve. Try to take the high water level curves in the past 60 years, such as 1931, 1926, and 1870, and find the average curve, such as "Line A." Then take the low water level curves in the past 60 years, such as 1900, 1916, and 1928, and find the average curve, such as "Line B." Compare "Line A," "Line B," and the 1931 water level line, such as "Line C," with this water level line, and we can see that the high water level in June this year has created a new record that has not been seen in the past 60 years, and is about the same as the highest water level last year. Based on the usual practice of flooding in previous years, if there is little rainfall in the upper and middle reaches in the coming month, around 200 millimeters (about 6 inches), then the water level curve should be like "Line D." If the rainfall is moderate, around 350 millimeters, and evenly distributed, then the water level curve will be like "Line E," with the highest point below 48 feet. The streets of Hankou will not be submerged. Otherwise, if it exceeds 400 millimeters to 500 millimeters or more, the surge in water level will be like "Line F," and it is unknown where it will end.</p>
<p>The Possibility of Flooding This Year. Excessive water volume cannot be accommodated by an excessive riverbed, so the discharge will not be smooth, and there will be no place to store water, which will inevitably cause flooding and collapse, leading to a major disaster. Therefore, those who manage water should build reservoirs in lakes and deep mountains and valleys for storage and discharge. As for the dikes on both sides, they should be widened to allow smooth flow. In ancient times, competing with water for land was strictly prohibited. In 1931, the National Government also proposed returning farmland to lakes. However, people in general do not weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and in addition to the main dikes built by the Water Disaster Committee, they have built small dikes. Between Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, dikes are like nets, turning the sea into mulberry fields. If the water has no way to go, how can it not cause trouble?</p>

<h3>To Resist or to Obey?</h3>
<p>- A Letter from Mr. Ma of Nanjing -</p>
<p>I have a very difficult problem now, and I would like to ask you to explain and instruct me clearly! The truth is this: Although I am already of marriageable age, I have dropped out of school and I can say that I am still completely unsure about how to conduct myself in life, so how can I have the energy to talk about engagement? However, my parents, who have exhausted their efforts to have sons and take wives, have been trying their best to arrange an engagement for me, forcing me to submit. This has put me in a state of worry, hesitation, and indecision. I would like to ask you to take the time to advise me!</p>
<p>Sir, my family is a completely old-fashioned family. My mother who gave birth to me abandoned me and passed away forty-five days after I was born. The current mother is my stepmother whom my father married later. Because there is little relationship in terms of childbirth and upbringing, we treat each other very politely. My father is a businessman, and my relationship with him is also extremely good! Now my father and my stepmother want to engage me to a 20-year-old lady who has received elementary education but has dropped out of school for seven years. Her family is as old-fashioned as mine. Her father was also a business tycoon who unfortunately died in February last year! She is the older sister of my stepmother's niece. My stepmother loves her very much and hopes that I can get engaged to her. My father also hopes that this marriage can become a reality in order to strengthen the relationship between my mother and me. But sir, although this lady and I live in the same area, we are miles apart and rarely meet. Her personality and everything about her are unknown and cannot be criticized. However, sir, I believe that marriage should have the following: (1) Possess ordinary knowledge, in other words, must have received secondary education. (2) Have the skills and will to live independently. (3) Have a friendship of more than a year to get to know each other's personalities. What my parents are doing is of course contrary to my own wishes. Logically, I should refuse and oppose it frankly. But sir, I am a person with a weak will and many worries. I cannot leave my family, so I should naturally pay attention to the safety of my family. What if my relationship with my parents breaks down after I oppose this matter, or even my father and mother become estranged? If a safe family is stirred up by me, what should I do? Who will bear this responsibility? If I say that for the sake of my family, I should reluctantly agree, then wouldn't my lifelong happiness be sacrificed as a result? Sir: What should I do? Please give me concrete instructions and guidance!</p>
<p>Answer: Our views on marriage have been repeatedly expressed in the previous newspaper, and you must have seen them. What you said in your letter is a common phenomenon. If you are willing to be "a person with a weak will," then bow your head and listen to orders. In the future, a "Filial Son Arch" can be erected in front of your ancestral hall, on which is written: "Zong Zijie sacrificed his lifelong happiness to fulfill the wishes of his parents, a pure filial piety!" How wonderful!! However, if you are not willing to eat this kind of unknowable cold pork head in the next life, then you have to change your direction - be a human being! Be a member of society! Simply reject this "usurped" marriage contract, which is to cut off the freedom of your sex life and the ownership of your actions!</p>

<h3>Career Guidance Week</h3>
<p>Vocational Education Day Yesterday was Vocational Education Day for the Career Guidance Week held by the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute of the China Vocational Education Society. Although it was drizzling in the morning, the number of guests was not reduced. The exhibition hall was often crowded with people. There were more than 400 people in the morning and afternoon. At 9:00 AM, a career guidance lecture was held. Yang Weiyu delivered an introductory speech, followed by speeches by Huang Renzhi and Jia Foru. In the afternoon, Jiang Wenyu and Yang Weiyu gave speeches.</p>
<h3>Huang's speech briefly stated that this summer has been continuously rainy, and reports</h3>
<p>From various places say that floods are imminent. Those who care about national affairs must share the deep sorrow. The occurrence of floods is due to the failure to use scientific methods for governance, the failure to take early precautions, and allowing them to become a major disaster. The advancement of students is the foundation for future participation in society. Laying a good foundation early will surely lead to good results. Therefore, what I want to talk about today is "How to receive vocational education," which is also for this reason. This question can be divided into three points: 1. Determine the purpose of studying early. The purpose is nothing more than serving society. Therefore, the best school to enter at the beginning is a vocational school, to avoid the pain of having no skills and suffering from unemployment in the future. 2. The goal must be correct. Regardless of the high or low of the profession, as long as you consider my profession, meet the needs of society, and benefit the public, even a lowly garbage collector is not shameful. This kind of occupation is actually more important than the president and commander. 3. The ambition must be firm. Do not easily change the subject I want to study. Studying engineering in the morning, business in the afternoon, and agriculture in the evening will lead to nothing. Therefore, if you study a certain subject at the beginning, you should continue to study this subject until the end. Future success will be limitless.</p>
<h3>Jia's speech Jia Foru talked about the question of young people seeking a way out</h3>
<p>First, you must ask yourself if you can endure hardship before you can talk about enjoying happiness in the future. Because going to school and seeking employment not only requires enduring hardship mentally, but also physically. To avoid suffering in the future, we must now prepare for how to receive vocational education. When you ask someone who has no specialized skills what they can do, they will definitely say they can do everything, but when they start doing things, they can't do anything. Having such people is the main reason for social chaos. Therefore, the education we young people receive is best vocational education, learning specialized skills, which will never be eliminated in society. Now the vocational schools in Nanjing and Suzhou have a total of more than 500 graduates this year. Because of the needs of society, none of these people are unemployed. It can be seen that people who have received vocational education will never be abandoned by society, and so on.</p>
<h3>Jiang's speech is roughly divided into four points: (1) Why receive</h3>
<p>Vocational education: 1. Personal environment, 2. Personal intelligence and abilities, 3. Personal aspirations, 2. How to receive vocational education: 1. Identify personal personality and abilities, 2. Do not easily change the subject you choose, 3. Do not admire vanity, 4. Emphasize both learning and doing, that is, use both hands, 5. Investigate the status of social occupations, 6. Pay attention to physical and mental cultivation, (A) Diligence, (B) Thrift, (C) Hard work and sacrifice (the above three are for oneself), 1. Be polite, 2. Benefit the group, 3. Love people and things (the above three are for others), 3. What is the effect of vocational education? 1. Occupational equality, 2. No food without labor, 3. Use both hands and brains, 4. What is vocational education? 1. Broadly, all occupations must be nurtured by education, 2. Narrowly, it is agriculture, industry, and commerce, etc., 3. Home economics, this is for women, etc.</p>
<h3>Yang's speech is roughly divided into three points: (1) Why receive</h3>
<p>Vocational Education Our purpose of receiving vocational education is to prepare to make a living for ourselves and serve society in the future. (2) How do we receive vocational education? 1. Investigate whether the subjects of the school are the same as your interests. 2. Choose a school with substantial content and no superficial show. 3. Have trustworthy teachers. 4. Have a good school spirit and reputation. 5. Have been operating for at least one semester. 6. Understand their content and not be tempted by form or vanity. 7. The main subjects in the school are suitable for my physical and mental health. 8. The school's expenses are affordable for the family. (3) We want vocational education, we must have six virtues: 1. Willing to endure hardship, 2. Consistent from beginning to end, 3. Work faithfully, 4. Have a strong will, 5. Be able to abide by the rules, 6. Have a broad vision, etc.</p>

<p>Difficult Family Circumstances</p>
<h3>Di Weizhou Drops Out of School and Returns Home</h3>
<p>Di Weizhou from Baoding, Hebei, 28 years old, graduated from Tsinghua University in Beiping. In 1931, he went to the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom at his own expense. Unexpectedly, due to difficult family circumstances, he was unable to continue his studies and had to drop out halfway. He wandered abroad and had no means of support. The Chinese embassies in the United States and Britain provided assistance for his return home. He arrived in Shanghai the other day and is currently staying in Room 47 of the Oriental Hotel on Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen. He has no money and it is difficult to maintain himself. It is heard that Municipal Government Secretary Zhang Tingrong yesterday sent a letter to the Second Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau asking them to provide relief and send him back to his hometown to avoid destitution.</p>
<h3>Chinese Science Society Biology Lecture</h3>

<h3>Disturbance at Pudong Middle School</h3>
<p>Pudong Middle School, a private school in this city, was founded nearly 30 years ago and was established by Yang Sisheng with donated funds from the former Qing Dynasty. The facilities are complete and it is quite famous in the country. However, in the past two or three years, due to the people in charge being incompetent, there have been disturbances every year, and this is now the fourth time. This disturbance has been going on for two weeks, and the school principal, Mr. Wu Xianglong, has also left the school early. Currently, the school is in a state of anarchy, maintained by the student union, and the order is still good. The other day, the entire representatives of the school also instructed each representative to go to the Education Bureau to request the dismissal of the school principal and the expansion of the board of directors. Director Pan personally replied and asked them to return to the school with peace of mind and wait for a solution. Yesterday, the person in charge of the school's student union said that after the January 28th incident last year, no one was responsible for the school.</p>
<p>The matter of the interruption lasted for a long time. Last fall, the board of directors appointed Principal Wu to take over. Since Mr. Wu took over, internal employment has been improper.</p>
<p>The curriculum and equipment do not comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, such as the lack of minerals in senior high school.</p>
<p>Major courses such as biology and intermediate physics responsibilities. Junior high school has no plane geometry, music, books, handicrafts and other settings. The main science courses of senior high school Chinese, English and Mathematics, are combined into one class for grades one, two and three, with more than sixty or seventy students. Junior high school even combines four classes for Chinese and other subjects, and the finances are not public, etc.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Burning Books</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The originator of burning books, as everyone knows, is Emperor Qin Shi Huang. In fact, his ancestors had already burned poetry and books. Qin Shi Huang's burning of books can only be considered as inheriting the ancestral teachings, not his own creation. Han Feizi's "He Shi Chou" says, "Shang Yang taught Duke Xiao of Qin to establish groups of ten and five families to report each other's faults, and to burn poetry and books to clarify laws." It can be seen that the burning of books began with Duke Xiao of Qin. People today scold Qin Shi Huang alone and not Duke Xiao, which is probably not fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Qin Xiao Gong’s and Qin Shi Huang’s policies have now spread to foreign countries. German students burned sex books in order to protect German women, which was applauded by most people, but many people also opposed it, believing that sex books should not be regarded as floods and beasts. The more sex books are burned, the more they are promoted, and the result may be counterproductive.</p>
<p>After Germany burned sex books, they "went all the way" and launched a large-scale purge of communist books. The police seized as many as 500 tons of banned books and burned them all, turning the indoctrinated theories into ashes. After all, the redness of books cannot compare to the redness of fire. In the end, it only created a large pile of paper ashes.</p>
<p>No one learns from Qin better than Germany, and no one learns from Germany better than Japan. Mr. Fujioka Tsuyoshi of Japan, who has a 25-year history of handling leftist publications, recently announced his conversion to the right wing and burned all his leftist books in public in Hibiya Park. Unexpectedly, the tyrannical policies of the Qin Dynasty, which occurred two thousand two hundred years ago, have become popular in two strong countries of Europe and Asia. This is truly an incredible step backward!</p>
<p>Qin Xiao Gong nodded in his sleep: "My way is traveling west to Germany." Qin Shi Huang also clapped his hands in his sleep: "My way is traveling east to Japan."</p>
<h3>Eulogy to Neighbors</h3>
<p>— Si Zi</p>
<p>Fate tricked me into living in this pigeon-cage-style attic. Separated by a partition is the family of our boss, Mr. XX. Mr. XX is from Ningbo, so naturally his family, big and small, all speak the Ningbo dialect. The duck-like sound of "za la, za la!" agitated my eardrums all day long. I feel like I live by a duck pond. Because I have to work early every day except Sunday, I get up very early. Naturally, my neighbors don't have an early market like me. The group of ducks, big and small, are all still sound asleep. By the time I have worked in the office for several hours and return to my cage at noon, my neighbors begin their day's morning exercises. These morning exercises are not going to the field to take deep breaths or practice Baduanjin, but everyone, having slept enough, lies in bed with their eyes wide open and practices their voices. The men sing "Yang Yanhui..." and "Lian Ying Asks for a Dream," while the women sing "Drizzle" and "Meng Jiangnu Seeks Her Husband..." After the morning exercises, they get up one by one and call "Wang Ma, fetch water!" "Li Ma, pour tea!" By the time I have lunch, they are having breakfast, or rather, the first meal of the day, because they will have many more meals after that, and it's impossible to distinguish between breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>
<p>After eating, the adults sneak out one by one, the men, young ones wearing suits, older ones wearing long robes, and the women all wearing the most fashionable summer dresses, short sleeves, exposing their white arms, high heels clicking as they walk out. They each find their own paradise, leaving behind only the children playing master at home. Whenever this happens, I have no work and just want to calm down to read some books or write some articles. Then the little ducklings start to make a racket. They jump, shout, sometimes act out dramas, taking the neck of the little maid Meixiang and riding it as a horse, sometimes "killing each other," the big ones bullying the small ones! Then the small ones cry, the big ones laugh, and I, in the next room, can only cover my ears with my hands, close my eyes, and silently pray to God to grant me a moment of tranquility.</p>
<p>Because of the day's exhaustion, I want to go to bed early at night. Every time I close my eyes, I am immediately awakened by the noisy sounds from next door. It turns out that the adults have all returned from paradise, and they have brought many angels from the outside world. For a while, the sounds of orioles and swallows, clever laughter and coquettish cries, rippled and vibrated in the entire space of my small building, making me unable to sleep. I simply open my eyes wide and calmly accept the night's music bestowed upon me by my fragrant neighbors. I hear a phonograph playing on one side, a man playing the harmonica, and a woman seeming to be singing and dancing. On the other side, I hear the crisp sounds of playing cards: "Pong, twenty-six, fifty-two, one hundred and four, and..." Every night, I have to wait until the music of my fragrant neighbors stops, around two o'clock in the morning, before I am pardoned and fall asleep.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday. Exceptionally, my fragrant neighbors have hired a few boats early in the morning. The whole family (naturally, leaving not even a single little duckling behind) has set off to travel to Mount XX. Taking advantage of this only day of tranquility bestowed upon me by God, I have written this Eulogy to My Neighbors. I bless my fragrant neighbors to be safe on their journey at this moment!</p>
<h3>I Love My Husband Association</h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>Don't be dissolute and greedy for wine, and don't be crazy and love to write poetry! If you are arrested and taken to the government office today, this time you will lose your old head. This is a poem of advice written by the wife of Yang Pu, a Song Dynasty person. It turned out that Emperor Zhenzong of Song knew that Yang Pu was a hermit and summoned him to become an official. He asked Yang Pu, "When you came out, did anyone write a poem to send you off?" Yang Pu smiled and replied, "No one else did, only my old wife sent me a poem," and then recited the above poem. Zhenzong knew that he was unwilling to become an official and still let him go back to the mountains and forests to be a hermit. When I saw this story and the poem "I Regret Teaching My Husband to Seek a Marquis" made by the Tang Dynasty people, I thought that the psychology of women in ancient times was very different from that of today. Who among the women today does not</p>
<p>desire to marry high-ranking officials and nobles, and enjoy the blessings of being a lady or a grandmother, without having to worry about the harm to virtue and good deeds done by officials, and also treading on many dangers? Can this be said to be truly "loving one's husband"?</p>
<p>The psychology of women today is that there is no one who does not hope that her husband will make a fortune, so that she can enjoy the happiness of vanity. Some families are already well-fed and clothed, and can live a stable life. But they don't know the principles of "knowing contentment brings no disgrace" and "knowing when to stop brings no danger." They neither advise their husbands not to do immoral things, nor give up the desire to be greedy for more. Because of their own modern extravagance, they cause their husbands to go astray, resulting in death, moral corruption, and family destruction. Such things often originate with women. Can this be said to be truly "loving one's husband"?</p>
<p>Well done! Well done! Foreigners have started an "I Love My Husband Association." This is truly good news and worthy of our promotion. California news: In Puente, someone has started an organization called the "I Love My Husband Association" to promote "humane treatment" of wives towards their husbands. The association does not hold meetings or charge fees. All women who join the association only need to fulfill one obligation, which is to actually respect and love their husbands. Otherwise, they are not qualified to be members. Since the establishment of this association, husbands who have long been subjected to marital power have suddenly become arrogant and elated. One husband said to others: "This association is the product of a great ideal. We have 'Mother's Day' and 'Father's Day,' but the poor husbands who work like servants every day are left behind, and not just for one day!" After all, Americans have</p>
<p>some English blood ties, and their thinking is not as new as that of France and Russia. Therefore, their novelists of the past, such as Washington Irving, in "Appendices" made the essay "Rip Van Winkle" and the essay "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" 一 one satirizing men who want to escape the shackles of shrewish wives, with the only way out being to flee the world. One describes the deep affection between husband and wife as an example for the world. Because men are sitting at home all day, afraid of cracks in their love, they come up with a clever way: go out in the morning and come back in the evening, pretending not to be unemployed, to maintain the love between husband and wife. Alas! The situation of American wives, how do they know that people in our country have also been infected? Most men understand the difficulty of uniting with women, the greatness of the price of love, and the bitterness of the taste of love. Which modern woman would be willing to start an "I Love My Husband Association" to deprive herself of her supreme "wifely power"!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast Army</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Ji Zhi smiled and said, "High may not be possible, but low is it not possible?" After speaking, he chuckled. Zhao Ziqiang had not yet understood his meaning, and said, "What agency is Mr. Gan currently employed in?" Ji Zhi said, "To be honest with you, I want to join the railway as a small worker. I haven't taken off my long clothes yet, and I can't take them off. If I take them off, I'll do it like this. Company Commander Zhao, don't think I'm joking. This is the truth. I feel that a person should rely on their own ability to find food. No matter what they do, they will feel mentally at ease. On the other hand, relying on others to do things, even if they get mixed up as high-ranking officials or make millions of dollars, there will still be a kind of pain in their minds. In Hai Dian, aren't people calling me Second Master? This means that I am just a sidekick to the master. Without the master, there would be no me." Company Commander Zhao laughed and said, "Mr. Gan is too modest. Working in his brother's agency doesn't count as reliance. It just depends on whether you have the talent. If you don't work in your brother's agency, he will still have to find someone else. To tell you the truth, what real talent and learning is needed to be an official now? If I had ten thousand guns, I would have the hope of becoming the governor of a province. You can't say that you can't handle the affairs in your brother's agency." Ji Zhi said, "Company Commander Zhao, you are a straightforward person. However, an honest official has a hard time judging family affairs. I quit being a master and came to the city to live in the guild hall. Of course, I have my own difficulties." Company Commander Zhao listened to him, and his actions were completely unrelated to an old maid. After thinking for a while, he smiled and said, "People in Hai Dian all say that you have been promoted. Who knew that you had some difficulties and moved out?" Ji Zhi smiled and said, "That old lady Yang, she thought I had been promoted too, right?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "She didn't mention it." Ji Zhi smiled and said, "I don't want to be a master anymore, but I must find a way out for myself and then return to Hai Dian, so that the people of Hai Dian can see that I am not incapable of eating without relying on my brother. Company Commander Zhao, I am very grateful to you for coming to see me today. If you meet people from Hai Dian and talk about me, please don't tell them about my situation." Zhao Ziqiang hesitated for a while and said, "Have you decided to be a small worker?" Gan Ji Zhi smiled and said, "I'm afraid I can't avoid taking this path." (108)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talks</p>
<h3>Idle Talk on Red Beans (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— You Qing</p>
<p>Qing Wan Hongyou has a Red Bean Poem: "Who calls for Little Plum, presuming to use Hong Er's name." It has the same artistic effect as Qi Zhongzhi's critique.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Daizong of the Tang Dynasty, the Rilin Kingdom presented red beans, large and luminous, named Jiduo Pearls.</p>
<p>Qing Wang Bichao also has a Red Bean Poem: "Ice-clean flowers, small and vibrant, connected, a wisp of red heart even more enchanting."</p>
<p>Ming Qu Dajun's "Wooden Words": "Beans are large and colorful. Village children use them to decorate their heads, resembling pearls. They can be stored for two or three years without spoiling. Now, some people also inlay them into rings or brooches as ornaments. Western women especially love this item for enjoyment."</p>
<p>Yang Wu Yuanci has a poem that states "Holding wine to wish the east wind, to cultivate double red beans." Liang Xi Gu's daughter saw and loved it, and recited it day and night. The four walls were all written with those two lines. At that time, Yuan Ci was called the Red Bean Poet. It is also a nice anecdote.</p>
<p>Xu Xinggong said that in the gardens of Lingnan, there is a "love tree" that bears fruit over the years, red in color like soybeans, hence the name. Each "love tree" bears several bushels of fruit, which is not the same as red beans.</p>
<p>My fellow townsman, Dongfang Bingfu, Zeng Mengpu, has a detailed article about the Red Bean Villa in the journal "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness," regarding Liu Rushi: "Shepherd's residence was at the Red Bean Village of Baimao, and he also built the Red Bean Villa. At that time, the daughter of Rushi was grown up and married. She, her husband, and her daughter resided in the Red Bean Village." Hou Yishi of Beiping inscribed himself as the "Master of the Double Red Bean Hall." His writings and poems are outstanding throughout the country. He is also a journalist. It is said that the "Master of the Double Red Bean Hall" is the pseudonym of Yuan Erhanyun. Regardless of whether it is Yishi or Hanyun, one who can inscribe such a name must be extraordinary. I heard from a friend that Dong Houzhai of Beiping, named the "Master of the Red Bean Hall," is skilled in Peking Opera, appearing on stage in makeup, resembling an old actor. The audience praises him.</p>
<p>I once mailed two red beans to Shou Juan, and he gifted me his inscription "I Regret Teaching My Husband" on my humble work, "The Dream of Becoming a Marquis," exchanging the word "bean" for the word "easy," just as exchanging a goose for a character is a refined incident in the literary world.</p>
<p>Zhao Shaokuang, the former editor of "Red Rose," also loved red beans. I once mailed them to him, and later received his letter saying: "There are also refined people among the postmen, who have already stolen one of them along the way. If people like Shou Juan and Hanyun heard about this, I don't know what they would think! (Laughing)." In the past, those who stole other people's articles were called "elegant thieves," and the postman's actions are also not without elegance. The author of "Hawthorne's Detective Stories," my old friend Cheng Xiaoqing, has never liked to write with a brush. I once used two red beans to request his inscription on his recent work "The Sound of Eggplants at the Cape," with the words "worthy of song and tears" as a gift, attached with a brief note, with a flavor of the small articles of the Six Dynasties.</p>
<p>Tian Xu Wo Sheng Chen Diexian composed a Red Bean Poem in the tune of "Red Feelings": "At the banquet, remember the song, loving the soft and beautiful hands, picking up a handful, like cherry lips, with carmine rouge-like red jade. After parting, miss you so much, I dare to recognize it as cuckoo blood, with frost-colored moth-green. Tell them to be careful of the candle, afraid of looking at the silk beads, causing her to shrink back. Measure them into ten dou, feeding them to parrots would be a waste. If you are afraid of coral leaking away, use the thread of love to tie them up. It's still not as good as the dice inlaid on the bones." The handwriting of a famous writer is extraordinary. Zhu Jiaju, Dun Sou of Fengxian, has two excellent poems thanking Qian Nantie of Changshu for the red beans: "Born from the south, most yearning, hard to get to hear, by the gift of the beloved, will want to repay it would worry be not to, immersed thought shame give Quince poem." "A bed of musical notation in my humble thatched hut, I have no character to write in a cabin on mountain ,I will make it a pair red bean from now on and compared with the old three scholar tree rhyme has extra strength."</p>
<p>Huang Jun Song Yao of Wu County also has a poem thanking Jing Qing for the red beans: "Given to me superior is the treasure light and round at night it has, 清歌 a new ballad, old hills in the vast calamity, wine directed East Wind wish it, the southern countries and春from the south countries grow longer, what can I give in return, chanting the song of the Quince". Lines 3 and 4 are unusually elaborate, and are the works of masters. Yang Qiuxin of Dantu gifted me a red bean poem, with the line "Shaped like a small sophora bean, affection is like a long willow branch." Qiuxin is sentimental, and the affection is seen in the poem.</p>
<p>In addition, there is Shen Xiaogeng of Panyu, and Mao Youyin of Rugao, with inscriptions on red bean paintings. Unfortunately, the lyrics are long and have been omitted. Xiaogeng has the lines "Holding wine to toast the fragrant tree, good to admire the tear-stained charm," and Youyin has the lines "Blame the east wind for being nosy, blowing the roots of affection long," which are both excellent lines.</p>
<p>I plan to widely collect poems and lyrics about red beans to create a small anthology of red bean collections. Those in the world who love red beans are requested to pay attention and exchange them for books, sent to Cuiying Middle School in Suzhou.</p>

<h3>Big Sale</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>French novelist Zola's "Rougon-Macquart Series" includes a work depicting department stores, called "The Ladies' Paradise." The main theme of this novel is how large department stores with strong capital oppress those small shops, and the stubborn resistance of the small shops, which ultimately fails. The so-called "Ladies' Paradise" is the brand name of the department store in the book.</p>
<p>Zola describes the strategy of the department store manager as "small profits and quick turnover," and the means of attracting customers is "big sales." Department stores are truly able to "reduce prices" when they want to defeat a certain opponent. They have strong capital and extensive publicity, so small shops are naturally no match for them and can only go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Ever since Shanghai had department stores, every time they had a big sale, I would worry about those small shops. However, there are exceptions. Ten years ago, when the first department store appeared on Nanjing Road, although I heard the owners of small shops frowning and saying, "Business is over," it seems that they are still able to struggle until now. Furthermore, since department stores pioneered "big sales," small shops have followed suit. Some shops simply have "big sales" all year round, with banners flying every day and military bands playing ditties like "Eighteen Touches." This year, because of the economic recession, there are big sale banners and bands on every road every day. There are many people watching,</p>
<p>but few people buying. Even the big department stores have had more big sales than in previous years. Upon entering, it's truly lively, especially the silk and cloth department, which is extremely crowded. From this, it can be seen that the appeal of big companies is still extraordinary. Looking at those high piles of bolts of fabric, the customers squeezed together, the red-faced and sweating shop assistants, and the constant ringing of the bells,</p>
<p>I thought of the atmosphere of battle during a big sale as described by Zola. I also vaguely heard the clumsy military band on the upper floors of a small shop also having a big sale on the same street playing "Eighteen Touches," which sounded increasingly bleak and sad.</p>
<p>In the current recession, the struggle of small shops is even more difficult. Perhaps those phenomena described by Zola will eventually appear here? No, although they are both cases of large capital overwhelming small capital, the meanings are different. What is being played here is not prosperous upward development, but downward self-preservation. The entire market is declining!</p>
<h3>Natural Disaster or Man-Made Calamity?</h3>
<p>— Tiesheng</p>
<p>The Yangtze River has seen a large rise in water levels in recent days, especially in the Wuhan area, where the momentum is fierce. If it continues to rise, another severe flood will naturally be expected.</p>
<p>According to reports, during the great flood two years ago, more than 50 million people suffered, and the losses were incalculable. Thinking of it now still makes people shudder. However, the formation of the previous great flood was due to people's dedication to war, leaving no time to take care of water conservancy, cutting down forests, and using embankment funds, resulting in barren mountains everywhere and empty coffers in all engineering bureaus. Therefore, when rain came, it all flowed into the river, the embankments were decayed, and they collapsed upon impact, leading to an unprecedented flood. The previous flood was less of a natural disaster and more of a man-made calamity! After experiencing a great disaster, people will naturally be wiser. Thus, there were many names such as the diversion of the Huai River into the sea and the embankment protection committee, and many funds were allocated. However, "only the sound of footsteps on the stairs is heard, but no one comes down." There are certainly many agencies, but no achievements have been seen in water management. The Hankou special telegram from the Shen Bao on the 19th stated ("...Pig Lane at Number One Pier had water ingress on the 19th, and Wuchang Wutai Sluice was also leaking, and the situation is serious"). From this, on the one hand, it can be seen that their achievement is only that the sluice leaks when the water comes; on the other hand, it can be seen that they only panic when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>In addition, from the following news, we can see that their use of embankment funds is no less than before. The Hankou telegram from the Shen Bao on the 19th stated, "The National Economic Council has sent letters urging the repayment of 2.3 to 2.4 million yuan in embankment funds borrowed by various agencies in Hubei to benefit embankment construction." Under this situation, how can the surging river tide be stopped? How can the residents along the Yangtze River not become fish and turtles?</p>
<h3>Sea</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>When I was young, I loved the sea, and I still haven't changed. My old home is located on the coast of the East China Sea. Although it is ten or twenty miles from the shore, I have wandered there. There are no high mountains or lush forests there, only a vast expanse of white sea.</p>
<p>At low tide, I often went to the beach to catch crabs and pick snails. At night, I stayed at the home of relatives near the sea, listening to the wind blowing and the sea roaring angrily. At that time, I was dark and healthy, and at a young age, I didn't care about walking dozens of miles.</p>
<p>Most of our villagers are farmers. I also love farming, herding, and the green fields and blue sky; however, my father didn't want me to do this kind of work.</p>
<p>I parted with this sea and wandered to other coasts. The seawater may still have the same taste, or maybe it's different, I'm not very clear. But when I feel wronged or unhappy, I still have to run to the beach and howl a few times.</p>
<p>The sea, it gives me comfort, tells me what is greatness. In the early morning, when the earth has just awakened from the darkness, the clear blue sea is rippling gently, the sea surface is covered with a faint mist, and the fishing sails begin to appear in the hazy light. Then the sun rises, and the sea waves shimmer with yellow, blue, and purple patterns.</p>
<p>But this doesn't last long. The weather near the sea is so unpredictable. In a moment, the sky is covered with dark clouds, and the strong wind blows unhindered. From the lightning-filled clouds, a trampling rain falls. The sky is dark, and the waves roar as if facing a great enemy, rising high as if to fly out of the water, and white waves rush everywhere. Nature seems to be crazy. But then the sky clears up again, and it is still a quiet, gently rippling scene.</p>
<p>I have also climbed the cliff facing the sea in the twilight, listening to the long cries of the storks and seagulls, with no one around, and looking down on the vastness, feeling the longevity of heaven and earth and the transience of human life, and couldn't help but shed a few tears of sadness.</p>
<p>In these short few years, I have wandered everywhere, going south and north. I have encountered the same sea, the same sunny and rainy days, the same tranquility and magnificence, but I have never encountered my dark and healthy childhood again.</p>
<h3>Cotton Quilt</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Five days ago, I asked Uncle Afu to speak to the labor recruiter in the factory for me, to add my name. I am now completely desperate, with no way to make a living. All my belongings have been pawned. Since losing money in business and returning some of the household furniture to pay off debts, I have been relying on pawning things to sustain two lives. For three or four months now, I have had no work. What can I do if I don't work? Working, I</p>
<p>know, is harder than doing business, but I can't say that.</p>
<p>Uncle Afu told me today that if I want things to succeed quickly, I have to give some "human favor" money. I asked him:</p>
<p>"What should I give?" I didn't expect there to be such a procedure. I thought this wasn't a common thing, right? However, Uncle Afu said:</p>
<p>"The usual practice is two silver dollars! This is a job for unskilled laborers. The daily wage is thirty-six cents. If you want things to go well, you have to give more 'human favor' money."</p>
<p>I was shocked. It seems that working is also hopeless. Starting a business requires capital, and selling labor also requires capital. What do I have now to give as this 'human favor' money?</p>
<p>Uncle Afu saw my difficulty. The result of our discussion was to temporarily pawn the only cotton quilt I had on my bed. He said, "If you can get the job, you can buy it back. When that time comes, we'll redeem it."</p>
<p>I walked into the room confused. My wife was lying on the bed, facing inwards. She couldn't earn money for me and often cried secretly. Every time I ran out of rice and took things to pawn, she would cry. At first, she refused, but later she had no choice. With tears in her eyes, she handed the things to me with a gloomy look and said, "When will this end? The things are almost all pawned." I said, "When I have money, I'll redeem them." But these things often sink like stones into the sea, and I myself don't know when I can get them back.</p>
<p>I hesitated at the bedside. I wondered how I should pull the cotton quilt off her. My heart was a little sad, and I couldn't lift my hand.</p>
<p>"Can you get up for a moment?" I said, "Let me take the quilt. I found a job."</p>
<p>"Found a job? Why take the quilt?" She seemed to sense something, and her body curled up a bit, and the quilt seemed to be wrapped even tighter.</p>
<p>"I have to pay the labor recruiter first. Uncle Afu said." "You're pawning it again? It's so cold. What will I use to cover myself if you pawn the quilt? I won't pawn it." Her nose was a little stuffy, and her voice came from her nostrils.</p>
<p>"I found a job. I can redeem it in two or three days. Get up?" I waited behind her for two minutes without any movement. I had no choice but to sit down beside her and put my heavy hand on her shoulder. Like a shivering cat, she immediately trembled under my hand and cried loudly, buried in the quilt.</p>
<p>I was silent for a long time in shame and anxiety. I didn't know what words I should use to comfort her. I only felt that I was dragging her down into a bottomless swamp. I felt infinite pain. I shouldn't be dragging her to perish together, but I couldn't save her. Every time I pawned something from her, I felt that she and I were sinking into the swamp once more. I didn't know the depth of this swamp, and I didn't know the end of our sinking. How heavy life is, how dark the world is?</p>
<p>Her throat was blocked by something, and she started coughing loudly. I held her head and moved it to the edge of the bed. I felt my brow aching. After coughing for a while, she said in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"If you pawn the quilt, what will I use to cover myself? Don't you know I'm sick? Don't you know I have a little one in my belly?..." Every word she said was like a hammer, hitting my heart heavily. I looked at the cotton quilt wrapped around her body and felt lost. I didn't know how today would end.</p>
<p>"Is it reliable that you found a job?" After a while, she said. "Uncle Afu said that if I give 'human favor' money, I can get a job as an unskilled laborer." I wasn't confident, but I thought Uncle Afu's words were my only hope. What other path could I take besides this one?</p>
<p>I dared not imagine that it was unreliable.</p>
<p>"Alright then." She firmly pulled the quilt off her body, gasping for breath, and said, "Take it, let me freeze to death, let me freeze to death." She immediately jumped out of the quilt. Seeing me sitting still, she held the quilt and shoved it into my arms, saying:</p>
<p>"Why don't you take it? Isn't he waiting outside?..."</p>
<p>Ah!" she said, turning her back and sobbing.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. I put the cotton quilt back on her, covered her well, but she pushed it away, grabbed the clothes from the head of the bed, draped them over her body, stood up, and walked outside, muttering, "Go, go!"</p>
<p>I thought for a moment in the room, rolled up the cotton quilt, and tucked it under my arm. Walking out of the gate, I felt dizzy and heavy, and I didn't know when I could redeem this cotton quilt.</p>
<h3>Carrot Stubble</h3>
<p>— Jules Kearo, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Personal Thoughts (Continued)</p>
<p>"But we always have to say something to pass the time," said Carrot Stubble, already a bit uneasy.</p>
<p>"It would be better if you kept your mouth shut," said Lébique, holding a candle in his hand. He walked away. The eldest brother, Félix, followed him.</p>
<p>"I hope you sleep well, old friend!" he said to Carrot Stubble.</p>
<p>Then the sister, Ernestine, stood up and said solemnly:</p>
<p>"Good night, dear friend!"</p>
<p>Leaving Carrot Stubble alone, bewildered and helpless.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Lébique told him how to think:</p>
<p>"Who does 'one' refer to?" Lébique said to him. "'One' doesn't exist. To say 'everyone' is empty and doesn't refer to anyone. You're too good at reciting what you've heard. Try to think for yourself. Present personal thoughts, start with just one."</p>
<p>His first attempt wasn't welcomed. Carrot Stubble covered the fire with ashes, lined the chairs against the wall, looked at the clock, and then returned to his bedroom. This room had a ladder leading to a cellar, so people called it the cellar room. This was a room that felt cool and lovely in the summer, where hunted game could be kept for a week without rotting. The last rabbit that had been killed was placed on a plate, blood flowing from its nostrils. There were also some wicker baskets, full of chicken feed. Carrot Stubble often enjoyed sticking his bare hands into them and stirring them playfully.</p>
<p>The family's clothes hanging on racks in that room usually made him uneasy. It was like some people who commit suicide first take off their boots and arrange them neatly on the wooden boards, and then run off and hang themselves. But tonight, Carrot Stubble wasn't afraid. He didn't glance under the bed. The moon, the shadows, the garden with what seemed like a well dug specifically for people to jump into from the window, didn't frighten him.</p>
<p>If he thought about being afraid, he would be afraid, but he wasn't thinking about that now. Wearing a shirt, he forgot that he should only walk on his heels so as not to feel the cold of the red bricks too much.</p>
<p>Lying in bed, he looked at the damp stone bottles and continued to develop his personal thoughts, which were called personal thoughts because they were only to be thought by oneself and not told to others.</p>
<p>The Storm of Leaves</p>
<p>For a long time, Carrot Stubble, lost in dreams, had been watching the highest leaf on the big poplar tree.</p>
<p>He idly thought, waiting for it to move.</p>
<p>It seemed to be separated from the tree, alone, unattached, free, living separately.</p>
<p>Every day, from morning to night, it seemed to be asleep.</p>
<p>From noon onwards, it was as dead as could be, it didn't look like a leaf, but like a stain in the sky. When Carrot Stubble became impatient and very uncomfortable, it finally moved. (To be continued)</p>

The Cantonese group advanced vigorously, reaching a maximum of fifteen yuan, but because the price was too high, many people sold, and it fell slightly.

<p>Commodities Stagnate in</p>
<h3>One Aspect of the Financial Situation</h3>
<p>In recent days, major cities have been experiencing rampant flooding, as if a major disaster is approaching. The circulation of commercial goods will inevitably be hindered. High-priced goods are stagnant, and financial flow will inevitably be inferior. The demand for large amounts of funds in the Shanghai port is generally due to goods, and now that they are suspended, the funds will naturally decrease. However, general fixed-order firms are urging the release of inventories, so the collection and settlement of goods in recent days is still considered non-</p>
<p>Weak, but there seems to be a dismal possibility thereafter. According to the survey, the source of imported goods is not as much as it used to be, and it is probably also affected by the flood. The early and mid-day foreign exchange rates in the two markets yesterday remained unchanged at seven points, and the exchange head was still soft as before, and all were made in white. This is also the reason why the overall situation in the market has not been able to develop. In the exchange market for opening and dismantling tickets, the early market transferred more than 5.7 million, and new transactions were 700,000 to 800,000. The mid-day was more than 300,000. The small general meeting traded more than 700,000. The bank's collection and settlement situation, the foreign merchant's collection and settlement of ticket amounts totaled 1.7 million to 1.8 million, foreign amounts 2.8 million to 2.9 million, and various pawned exchange goods and miscellaneous amounts totaled more than 4.1 million, foreign amounts 4.3 million, the settlement and collection of more than 1.2 million, foreign amounts 2 million, the special amount of more than 2.7 million, and the silver out of the warehouse 400,000, and 700,000 in foreign currency. The Chinese banks collected and settled 3.7 million to 3.8 million ticket amounts, various goods, exchange taxes, pledges, miscellaneous amounts totaled more than 7.1 million, the settlement and collection was 2.3 million to 4 million, and the special amount was more than 2.8 million. The warehouse intake was 600,000. The Japanese banks took in 500,000, and out of the warehouse 400,000 in foreign currency. The Qianzhuang foreign public list collected and settled more than 43.3 million, the foreign exchange head amounts totaled more than 7.7 million, the collection and settlement of exchange amounts from all routes was more than 900,000, the source of passenger routes was 100,000, going to the stomach 200,000, receiving cash 400,000 to 500,000, the foreign pledge amount transaction was more than 1.8 million, the banknote recovery and issuance was 2.1 million to 2.2 million, and the cash and foreign currency were still flowing out of the country.</p>
<p>In addition, the total number of exchanges at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 22nd was 4,593,274 yuan, 3 dimes, 2 cents in silver dollars, including 2,535,718 yuan, 8 dimes in silver dollars, and 2,057,555 yuan, 2 dimes in exchange silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Dime Coins Dropping, Copper Coins Lengthening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the small silver coins in Jiangnan had a small transaction, and the market price was stable, only a small dime from the previous day, calculated to be 850 yuan. The transactions made were 4,500 dimes in the morning market, and 5,000 dimes in the mid-day market. The small silver coins in Guangdong were 772 yuan and 5 dimes in the morning market, which seemed to have fallen by one yuan from the previous day, while the mid-day market rebounded by 4 dimes, to 772 yuan and 9 dimes. As a result, it was only small by 6 dimes from the previous day, but the general trend was small, which could not be avoided. The transactions made were 105,000 dimes in the morning market, and 38,000 dimes in the mid-day market. Copper coins slightly lengthened by 500 texts, to 318,000 texts, and 46,110 strings were transacted, with a price of 14,500 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities and Government Bonds Remain Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>While bullish and bearish forces occasionally clash, fluctuations stay within a range of thirty to fifty cents. Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange and the market remained calm. Although bullish and bearish sentiments contended, the activity was not intense. Prices rose and fell unpredictably, but within a range of thirty to fifty cents. Bullish investors aimed to raise prices, but market prices were already high, with little support. Bearish investors tried to push prices down, but bullish investors remained unfazed. It appears that both bullish and bearish investors have already rolled over their positions. Therefore, the volume of this settlement is expected to be larger than in other months. With more actual deliveries and receipts of goods, significant price fluctuations are unlikely. Major bearish players, having secured favorable prices, are prepared for substantial deliveries. Whether bullish investors have the strength to receive these deliveries remains uncertain. Without any changes to the overall environment, the situation after settlement should become clearer. Yesterday, at the opening, there was a slight bullish squeeze, with bond prices falling by about thirty to fifty cents. During the secondary session, short covering led to a rebound, with the 20th Customs Bond soaring back up by as much as seventy cents. Other bonds also rose by thirty to forty cents. In the afternoon, prices opened about twenty to thirty cents higher. The Unified Tax Bond was the only one to fall by fifteen cents. Prices closed slightly lower by ten to twenty cents, while the Salt Tax Bond rebounded by about ten cents. Overall, prices rose anywhere from ten to twenty cents to fifty to seventy cents. Throughout the day, the 50th Company consistently bought forward Unified and Salt Tax Bonds in each session. The 46th Company sold a large quantity of spot goods, and the northern firms also leaned towards selling, suggesting potential future changes. The total trading volume was 10,021,000 yuan, including 5,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures trading in Unified and Salt Tax Bonds accounted for 3,125,000 yuan, Disbandment Bonds accounted for 1,435,000 yuan, the 1920 Customs Bonds accounted for 1,070,000 yuan, the 20th Shaking and 20th Customs Bonds accounted for 2,475,000 yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 580,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market: Stagnant Start, Then Rally</h3>
<p>Report from Sin Fung &amp; Co.: On the 21st (of this month), the New York stock market started sluggishly. However, news from London that the US dollar-to-British pound exchange rate might stabilize at $4.40, coupled with positive news about the steel and electricity sectors, led to a market rally in the late session. The total trading volume was 3,890,000 shares. According to the Steel Age magazine, the workload for the steel industry this week increased to 50%. Several factories are unable to meet demand and cannot deliver on schedule. Orders for retail and automobile industries continue to increase, and automobile production in June is expected to exceed that of May. The quantity of steel used by the automobile industry is expected to continue until the end of July. A special cable from our New York office indicated that oil stocks were the strongest today. Stocks in the petroleum, automobile, and agricultural equipment sectors are expected to remain robust. The recent developments at the World Economic Conference suggest the government's determination to prevent any hindrance to raising prices. The unexpected Western influence on cotton acreage reduction suggests that prices will likely continue to rise. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>30 Industrials: 95.91 Up 0.68</p>
<p>20 Railroads: 44.39 Up 0.17</p>
<p>20 Utilities: 34.95 Down 1.03</p>
<p>14 Bonds: 84.78 Up 0.03</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Prices Remain Weak</h3>
<p>| Sluggish Real Demand is a Major Obstacle | The yarn market is relatively stable. The large drop in prices led to profit-taking short covering, causing a slight rebound in the market. However, real demand remains sluggish, and various firms show no interest. Market sentiment is indifferent. High cotton prices are causing increasing difficulties for factories.</p>
<h3>Cotton Futures Rebound After a Good Start</h3>
<p>Cotton futures opened this morning with slight buying interest due to the rebound in US cotton prices. Short covering caused prices to rise by four, six, or eight cents for various months. The market continued to rise in the afternoon, following the cotton market. Near the closing of the third session, it was reported that actual yarn transactions were limited, and prices fell by one, two, or three cents for various months. The total trading volume for the day was 46,000 bales. Sales included 1,600 bales from Li Chang, 1,450 bales from Yi Chang, 1,600 bales from Chang Feng, and 1,000 bales from Tong He.

<p>Inland: 40, Peers: 140, Haizhou: 10, Yunnan: 60, Wuhu: 10, Guangdong: 10, Hankou: 20</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Rise by More Than One Yuan This Month</h3>
<p>Cotton prices have risen significantly this month because the local brokers sold 8,000 dan of coarse cotton to the Japanese firm, Dong Mian, at a low price of two yuan per dan. As a result, buyers seized the opportunity to manipulate prices and bought heavily in the futures market. Prices have risen by more than one yuan this month. However, the yarn market remains weak, with no interest in physical cotton. Overseas cotton markets are also subdued.</p>
<h3>Cotton Futures: Bullish Investors Increase Positions in Near Months</h3>
<p>Zheng Cotton futures opened this morning with a lack of sellers. Bullish investors increased their positions in the near months, causing a sudden jump in the market. Prices rose by 1.30 to 3.40 yuan for various months. The market remained favorable in the afternoon, but some investors sold off during the rise. Prices fell back by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan in the second and third sessions. The total trading volume for the day was 136,700 dan. Sales included 3,900 dan from Yu Kang, 3,000 dan from Rong Xing, 2,500 dan from Ren Feng, 4,000 dan from Tai Chang, 5,700 dan from Yi Chang, 4,300 dan from Yu Chang, and 3,800 dan from Yuan Da. Purchases included 5,000 dan from Chun Ji, 3,600 dan from Ji Feng, 4,000 dan from Da Feng, 6,500 dan from Geng Feng, 3,200 dan from Yuan Tai, 8,500 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, and 7,600 dan from Chang He.

<h3>Raw Cotton Merchants Show Little Interest</h3>
<p>The raw cotton business remains sluggish. Neither Chinese nor foreign factories show any interest in purchasing. Fire-damaged cotton is priced at 44.75. Fung Tin advanced 300 bales to be sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Futures Offer 10 Cents Key</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was invigorated by the strength of Wall Street. Factories actively bought distant futures, and the market was robust and firm. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures prices rose by 14 to 16 points. Spot prices in Liverpool fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 6 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying, but later weakened due to profit-taking by several bulls. As a result, Omra remained unchanged, Pingar rose by half a rupee, and White Broach fell by 0.25 rupees. Original telegrams are listed on the left (dated the 21st):</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton (Compared to Previous Day) (Converted to National Currency) British Cotton (Compared to Previous Day) (Converted to National Currency)</p>
<p>7.92 Up 7.50, 7.59 Down 0.15</p>

<p>Omra 8.50 Flat</p>
<p>White Broach 2.25 Down 0.25</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Futures Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>| Subsequent Market Awaits Factory Output | Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for various months continued to rise. The quoted price for foreign wheat rose by 0.50 to 0.80 yuan. The weather remains unfavorable, and floods in various regions may become a major disaster. As a result, prices for various months immediately rose by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. However, with bullish investors taking profits, prices softened again. Prices rebounded near the close. After the opening of the afternoon session, prices initially remained stable but gradually fell. Major local and inland factories continued to release flour due to sluggish sales. There were rumors that large factories had a significant stockpile of flour that needed to be transferred. This created a sense of uncertainty and selling pressure. While the floods are a reality, sluggish flour sales are also a factor preventing price increases. Market insiders are pessimistic, and their concerns are not without reason. As a result, the price for this month remained unchanged. The price for July rose by 0.025 yuan, August rose by 0.075 yuan, September rose by 0.025 yuan, October rose by 0.05 yuan, and November rose by 0.025 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Start Strong, Finish Weak</h3>
<p>| Abundant New Wheat Arrivals, Limited Factory Appetite | Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, prices for various months showed a steady and strong trend. The quoted price for foreign wheat rose by around 0.50 to 0.80 yuan. The cloudy and rainy weather and floods in various provinces continued to boost market sentiment, which was better than the previous day by about 0.02 to 0.04 yuan. However, the rumors that Japan had purchased wheat were completely untrue, so market sentiment stabilized, and prices could not rise significantly. In the afternoon, the market weakened again as inland firms continued to sell and new wheat arrivals flooded the market, making it difficult for prices to hold up. As a result, prices gradually declined. The price for July remained unchanged. Prices for August, September, and October fell slightly by 0.02 yuan. The price for November rose by 0.02 yuan. The current market is characterized by abundant arrivals and limited factory appetite. The market remains weak despite the calm. The opening prices for wheat were 3.70 yuan for wheat from Hezhou, Huzhou, and Wujiang, 3.70 yuan for wheat from Anqing, 3.70 yuan to 3.60 yuan for wheat from Xiapu Kou, 3.63 yuan for wheat from Nanjing, 3.75 yuan for wheat from Yangzhou, 3.75 yuan to 3.60 yuan for wheat from Jiangyan, 3.64 yuan for wheat from Zhenjiang, and 3.70 yuan for wheat from Qishuyan. A total of 11,500 bags were opened. 7,000 to 8,000 bags of wheat arrived by ship, with 4,500 bags opened. High-quality wheat was priced at 3.68 yuan to 3.59 yuan, which was distributed among the factories.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales in Zhejiang Are Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign indica rice market was very sluggish because Fuzhou firms had not purchased rice for two days. Xiang and Gan indica rice, which used to sell well to Fuzhou firms, were most affected. Foreign rice was still able to hold its ground because the owners were foreign merchants who were reluctant to sell at low prices. The market for Minbang rice remained sluggish as before. However, sales in Zhejiang seemed to be gradually becoming more active. In addition to the rice allocated by brokers and the rice stored, 183 bags of Xiangjing rice and 418 bags of Nanjing brown indica rice were purchased in the market, both priced at 6.40 yuan. 60 bags of Jingche indica rice were purchased at a price of 7 yuan. 300 bags of Nanjing and Wuxi brown rice were purchased at a price of 6.47 to 6.48 yuan. 100 bags of Number 1 New Saigon rice were purchased in this street at a price of 8.40 yuan, which was 0.05 yuan lower than before. 60 bags of Jingche indica rice were purchased at a price of 7 yuan. 300 bags of Nanjing and Wuxi brown rice were purchased at a price of 6.47 to 6.48 yuan. 100 bags of Number 1 New Saigon rice were purchased in this street at a price of 8.40 yuan, which was 0.05 yuan lower than before.</p>
<h3>Summary of Silk, Tea, and Silkworm Cocoon News</h3>
<p>New Cocoons from Yangzhou are Shipped to Shanghai Continuously</p>
<p>The production of silkworm eggs in Yangzhou has decreased this year, but the quality of cocoons is good. Silk merchants in this port have raised capital to go to Yangzhou to weigh and purchase new dried cocoons. They have continuously packed and shipped them to Shanghai by riverboat, with a total of 780 bales shipped so far.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Silk Factories Resume Operations One After Another</h3>
<p>There are a total of 49 silk factories in Wuxi, with 13,678 silk reeling machines. Before the new cocoons were on the market, only 8 or 9 factories were barely operating. Now that the spring cocoons are abundant and of good quality, and overseas silk prices have soared, the silk factories are resuming operations one after another. Currently, 30 factories, including Yongtai, Jinji, and Huaxin, have resumed operations, with a total of more than 7,800 silk reeling machines in operation. Another 6 or 7 factories, including Zhenlun, are also preparing to resume operations.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Five Bales of Silk Shipped to India</h3>
<p>There are a total of six Douppion silk factories in Shanghai. After last autumn, only one or two factories were struggling to operate. After the new cocoons came on the market, Fulun and other two factories have resumed operations one after another. The inventory of old silk is gradually thinning. There are still sporadic sales to India. Yesterday, the world class Bannarison ship exported another 25 bales of old Douppion silk to Mumbai for transshipment to India.</p>
<h3>Rayon Market Trends Towards Calm Weakness</h3>
<p>With fluctuating exchange rates, the price of rayon has become relatively weak, and sales are still declining. Yesterday, only Wu Yu Co. purchased 18 boxes of Blue Bell and other brands of spot futures, with prices ranging from 171.25 yuan to 160.75 yuan, down by 0.50 to 0.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Continue Silk Sales</h3>
<p>With volatile exchange rates, overseas silk prices fluctuate constantly. Although American firms in Shanghai have an appetite for replenishing stock, Chinese silk merchants are reluctant to sell at slightly lower prices, making it difficult for silk sales to progress. Yesterday, it was estimated that Qianli Co. and others shipped 130 bales of White Factory silk to Shanghai, with stable prices.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Trading Booms</h3>
<p>Yesterday, green tea trading by foreign firms was very prosperous. Large foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson, Concord, Jinlong, and Tongfu made large-scale purchases of several types of green tea, including Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, Xia Mu, and Ma Zhu. Goods from Wudong, Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian were sold as soon as they arrived. Low-grade goods from Wenzhou, Yushan, and Tuzhuang were also slightly more active than before. The market has shown a stable trend. According to tea merchants, the recent increase in green tea sales is due to the low tea prices and the relatively small fluctuations in sales prices, which has increased purchasing power.</p>
<h3>Linen Cloth and Broad Hemp Fabric Sales Are Strong and Prices Are High</h3>

Linen cloth includes crepe, sesame seed, broad, and San Gang patterns. Colors include yellow, white, and gray, each with its own sales strengths, depending on customer demand. Fair broad 36-inch linen cloth sales have been particularly strong recently. Tailors from the capital and Suzhou have all demanded it. The market is very bullish.

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About Clothing</h3>
<p>Clothing is almost as important as food. Someone who eats but has nothing to wear cannot be considered a "complete person," and someone who has neither food nor clothing deserves to be ridiculed by gentlemen and ladies!</p>
<p>Just like with eating, people do not lack clothing because they do not know how to wear it, but because others have clothing to wear while they do not. So the efforts of weavers and tailors are often in vain.</p>
<p>I remember a time when a general who also served as the county magistrate suddenly arrived in my county. This hero was truly brilliant. Under the spirit of diligent governance, he suddenly realized that people with nothing to wear were not only a health hazard but also an eyesore. So he immediately issued a decree: "Villagers are prohibited from entering the city half-naked." Later, two wooden stakes were erected in front of the county government office. Anyone who violated the order would be tied to the stakes and punished by being exposed to the sun all day. Some could not withstand such a brutal punishment and fainted under the scorching sun. However, his subordinates eventually suggested changing the punishment from sun exposure to a fine of five yuan. So public servants went to the countryside to search for violators, and the money collected naturally increased the government's revenue. So this benevolent official gained both fame and fortune. According to the villagers, when he left, the gentry even erected a "Monument of Remembrance" for him. However, this happened after the success of the National Revolution, which is worth recording.</p>
<p>That being said, there are also many gentlemen who are willing to do their best for people with nothing to wear. For example, the manager of a certain public factory in Shanghai issues a set of blue work clothes to each worker upon entry. The uniform clothing enhances the appearance. However, four yuan is deducted from the total wage of five yuan at the end of the month. This is also very beneficial to the factory. "A dog tears tattered clothes" is an obvious fact. If dogs do this, how much more so people? So those who are poorly dressed are squeezed into streetcars that have been downgraded from second-class to third-class, and they wipe the oil stains from their buttocks onto the white silk gowns of others, inevitably being scolded: "You pig! Why don't you sit on the trailer?" As for</p>
<p>These people, if they insist on skipping a few pancakes and trying to get into the first-class section, it is of course even more inappropriate, especially since the rules</p>
<p>It is already noted above: those with torn and worn clothes are not allowed to enter.</p>
<p>From this, it seems that dressing is really important. So many young men with slicked-back hair wearing white silk jackets and trousers, although they may not have food every meal, their clothes must not be messy.</p>
<p>As for wives wearing qipaos and gentlemen wearing suits, it is all to suit their status. However, Chinese people should always wear Chinese clothes. For example, Mr. Yang Xingfo, because he loved horseback riding, unfortunately died under the blue sky and white sun in riding pants. However, it is not very dignified for a literary man to be buried in riding attire. So when he was being dressed for the coffin, he had to be in a long robe and mandarin jacket.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Joint Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>—Ben</p>
<p>In recent weeks, news about the joint entrance examination has occupied a large portion of the education section of newspapers. It can be classified into: 1) Reports on the joint entrance examination in a certain province or city; 2) Students protesting against the joint entrance examination; 3) The Ministry of Education strictly ordering students to participate in the joint entrance examination; those who fail will not be allowed to enter university; 4) Educational authorities in a certain location issuing important statements about the joint entrance examination; 5) Disputes occurring during the joint entrance examination in a certain location.</p>
<p>From these many mixed messages, our irrepressible doubts have long been aroused. Those involved tell us that this is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will, a major policy promulgated by the state, aimed at promoting teaching efficiency, selecting true talents, and raising the level of culture, as if this is the only magic trick to diagnose our country's education, and the future of education lies in this.</p>
<p>We do not oppose strictness in education, but what is called strictness should not focus solely on examinations, and especially not on the formal joint entrance examination; rather, it should focus on the strictness of educational administration and educational policy; it should also not be limited to the students alone; the educational authorities should be even more strict.</p>
<p>Teaching efficiency depends on the education system, the school authorities, and especially the social environment, and not on the imperial examination-style joint entrance examination. If it is said that the joint entrance examination can check students' grades, then are the exams held by schools on weekdays insufficient to check them? The scope of the joint entrance examination is to test the entire academic program. For example, the high school joint entrance examination tests the six-year curriculum of high school. Because of this, many students feel unprepared and simply do not prepare. In this way, can teaching efficiency be promoted?</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about selecting talents. Anyway, this has long become an empty slogan. Since the Examination Yuan and the partial examinations held by various provinces and regions, there have been many, and the results have only been seen in the newspapers by those who have passed the examination, and several times we have seen students asking the examiners a bunch of questions. Facts tell us that the current society does not need true talents. All places that need true talents have long been firmly occupied by people with power. No one has the possibility of getting a foothold. Here, you only need to know how to flatter and applaud, and you don't need real talent.</p>
<p>Again, talking about raising the level of culture makes us even more confused and angry. The entire education system has no definite direction. One person comes to power and adopts American-style education, and another person peddles Western European education, Japanese education, or even different provinces, each doing its own thing, a dazzling array of things. The schools are used as private domains, the students are used as test subjects, and even imperialist education and church education are mixed in, filling the country. Everyday education has already become such a void, and wanting to raise the level of culture through a joint entrance examination is not only unable to achieve the goal, but may even lead students to an increased reliance on luck and vanity, and further lower the level of culture.</p>
<p>That being said, the joint entrance examination is being held in a grand and bustling manner in various provinces and regions. Our city, the economic and cultural center, has already held it the day before yesterday. Here, we originally hoped that all students in the city would equally endure a few hours of suffering and equally accept strictness, but unfortunately, "joint entrance examination disputes" and "cheating" have resounded in our ears. The examination hall was especially chaotic, and the reason, of course, was cheating, which makes it even more conceivable how serious the problem is.</p>
<p>China's education is difficult, and the joint entrance examination has come to this. What else can we ordinary people say? We can only hold our noses and sigh.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of an Imperial Daughter</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Rain drizzled in the sky, and the towering clock tower cut through the gloomy sky like a monster. This usually bustling street had only a few rickshaws parked at the entrance of the dance hall. They hunched their shoulders and buried their heads, hoping to find patrons to solve their livelihood for the next day. The neon lights had lost their luster in the rain, and the music from the dance hall floated out like ghostly wails, making people feel a chill. Yingzi, with sleepless eyes, watched the electric needle on the clock tower, just five minutes shy of twelve. She wearily applied white powder and red rouge, preparing to sell her soul. Weakly stepping out of the pigeon cage, the rain blew in her face, reminding her that she had to wear a smile to swindle people's money. So she darted into that low-class dance hall.</p>
<p>Inside the dance hall, there were only a few scattered customers. The White Russian boss leaned against the counter, like a sleeping pig. When he saw Yingzi darting in like a little crow, he magically put on a smile.</p>
<p>"Miss Yingzi, it's raining... Oh, please come and sit here." He humbly pushed a chair towards Yingzi's bottom.</p>
<p>This dance hall usually had six or seven fallen "three-crow" girls. Their patrons, apart from sailors, mainly relied on lower-class workers. They had nowhere else to vent their sexual desires in this area. The aristocratic White Russian, who once came from a duke, gave up his greasy soap business and ran this dance hall. After several days of rain, those girls either found patrons somewhere else and were never seen again, so today the White Russian was especially attentive to Yingzi's arrival. He personally poured her a glass of green liquor, narrowing his eyes and saying, "Miss Yingzi, sing a song." Yingzi quickly jumped from the chair to the center of the stage, waving her two white legs, singing a vulgar song from the Spanish slums, while her fingers approached her lips and waved towards the audience. A drunk white man grabbed Miss Yingzi into his arms, and Miss Yingzi only giggled, making the White Russian clap his hands happily.</p>
<p>"Two shots of vodka!"</p>
<p>The White Russian trembled all over like a crawling snail. He knew that as long as Miss Yingzi was willing to come, his business would improve. After sending over two glasses of liquor, he calculated who would keep Miss Yingzi overnight, so he could make up for the losses of the past three days.</p>
<p>The white man drank the liquor himself, then forcibly poured the strong drink into Miss Yingzi's little cherry lips. Miss Yingzi's legs waved in the air, which, although was a sign of struggle, was also a half-hearted attempt to entice. The white man laughed, the White Russian also laughed, and Yingzi's face was full of smiles, because she knew she couldn't cry.</p>
<p>"Two shots of vodka!"</p>
<p>Rain drizzled in the sky, and the clang of the bell tower sent from the tall building. The drunk white man threw Miss Yingzi to the ground, took out two dollars, sang a drunken song and strode out. Several customers, having watched their fill of the show, also smiled satisfactorily and left. The White Russian, unexpectedly receiving money, also smiled and bowed repeatedly to show his farewell, but Miss Yingzi cried.</p>
<p>A diner that could barely make ends meet was destroyed by the January 28th incident's artillery fire, and her father sacrificed himself under the banner of the Japanese spirit. Thinking about whether the imperial warlords could wipe out the shame of Japanese daughters after seizing China's three northeastern provinces, she cried and refused the White Russian's forty cents, rushing into the rain-drenched street...</p>

<p>Correspondences from Shop Employees</p>
<h3>Harming National Credit</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>My hometown is Shaoxing. When Sun Chuanfang was the military governor, he once issued a type of national debt. At that time, I was still young, and I can't remember exactly which year of the Republic it was. My family was assigned 30 yuan, and the wealthiest family in the village was only assigned 20 yuan. Comparing their family property, they had at least twenty times more than my family. This time, the money they contributed was actually less than my family's. This was probably because my father and grandfather were both illiterate. They had money and power, so naturally they got a much better deal. At that time, my grandfather, after being intimidated by several so-called stewards and local gentry, had no choice but to swallow his anger and pay up. Taxation is a duty that people should fulfill, let alone national debt. But my grandfather was an uneducated man, only knowing about his family and not knowing about the country. So from then on, he made a fuss at home all day long, my father almost committed suicide, my mother also threw away all the silkworms, and my grandfather also became ill from depression, and soon passed away.</p>
<p>Sir, how sad and hateful this makes me! Even now, my mother still tells me with tears in her eyes! Several years ago, the state had already allocated the money to be repaid. Several wealthy and powerful households had also received it back. My father, notified by neighbors, rushed to claim it, but the several stewards and local gentry gave vague replies. My father went to ask several times, but they always搪塞 him. Now, if I were to sue in court, they are all the township chiefs, supervisory committee members, and mediation committee members in the rural township offices. The current regulations, it is said, require mediation committee mediation before a lawsuit can be directly filed in court. So what method can be used to recover this money?</p>
<p>Sir, you are a leader of the people, and you can always solve all kinds of difficult problems for people. I don't think you will refuse my request this time. Please instruct me on a method, I am eagerly waiting for it! Please publish it in the shop employee correspondence column in the next few days, I pray.</p>
<p>Respectfully, He Jiatu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: These local tyrants and evil gentry are the most hateful of all. All bad politics and all evil systems are built on their foundation. You think the country's credibility has been swept away, and no one cares to raise national debt, so it has to resort to the final method of hard assignment. Those who handle it should be fair and just, so that the credit of the national debt can be temporarily established. Who knows that they only care about profit, not only distributing it unevenly in the front, but also vaguely swallowing it in the back. It will be seen that the country's credibility has been completely ruined by them. Therefore, killing them is not enough to cover their crimes. Your father's lack of knowledge is forgivable, so he did not resist at the time, which has already benefited them, letting them逍遙法外 for many years. As for you! Judging from the letter, you are not a completely ignorant person; logically, your courage should be stronger. Even if you don't think about the credit of the entire country, you should recognize them as personal enemies and rise up to fight them "不共戴天". As for going through mediation, it is entirely limited to civil matters and criminal matters that are "告訴乃論." This type of criminal case of "Harming National Debt Credit" can be directly prosecuted.</p>

<h3>Under the Red and Green Lights (8)</h3>
<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>(6) What else can he say?!</p>
<p>The brilliant, lively, and noisy city of night, tonight, lay like a beast, panting in terror. Companies, banks, and stores were all tightly closed, letting piles of people probing for news on the streets, wriggling and whispering in the dark. Suddenly, a noble car sped past like the wind. The conversation in the car could only be vaguely heard by the driver sitting in front:</p>
<p>"...Yang Jie夫嗎! I know, he is a very famous merchant gentleman! He is..." A man's voice! Some suspicion and awe.</p>
<p>"It's Yang Jiefu, you can see him in a moment, it doesn't matter, just say you are my cousin, that we met by chance, luckily my surname is also Li!" A woman's voice! With a kind of newly excited and pleasant tone. "...Does he still have the heart to open a tea dance party? Isn't his yarn factory unreliable?"</p>
<p>"That kind of words! Seems to be a little mocking of the man for not being 門檻 , "This is the second tea dance party, the last time was at Zhao Yishan's mansion! Today is at Wu Ziqing's house, a large 洋房! It's just that business is not allowed during the war in 大沪, 大东, otherwise it would be more convenient! But it doesn't matter, you are my cousin! ···" The voice was deliberately lowered, the woman may have fallen on the man's 大发 leg. Then there was silence, in this mysterious silence, the driver tried hard to suppress his own 肉麻 imagination, bracing himself to rotate the machine disc. Only when he heard a burst of machine gun fire, did he realize that turning over a street would be Wu Mansion, so the wheels slowed down.</p>
<p>After a while, the Third Concubine appeared very gorgeously dressed in the crowded living room, everyone turned their heads to cast a kind of enviable gaze 丨 This is to envy Yang Jiefu, the first to come forward was the hostess here, Mrs. Wu:</p>
<p>"...Came just in time, Ziqing said that Mr. Yang was probably busy and would not come?" Mrs. Wu took a look at the person walking behind the Third Concubine, not Yang Jiefu, but a young man she had never seen before, she did not have time to suspect</p>
<p>, the Third Concubine immediately turned around and introduced:</p>
<p>"What a coincidence, my cousin was just recently forced to return from Japan, this is Wu Ziqing, Mrs. Wu, my cousin is Li Shiqiao."</p>
<p>Mrs. Wu is a obese middle-aged woman who also learns the etiquette of the social world, 久仰, 久仰 greeted twice and then afraid to go to say what her 天老头 said.</p>

<h3>Hollywood's Revival of Musical Films</h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>We still remember that in 1929, Hollywood's film companies, enlightened by the film "Broadway Melody," all devoted their full efforts to musicals, recruiting many musical talents from Broadway or elsewhere. At the same time, poets and writers also carried their suitcases and rushed to Hollywood in batches. But how long did it take for the atmosphere of Hollywood to be lowered in temperature as if struck by violent storms. Perhaps this is to blame on the producers for not having the ability to create hard. Therefore, in the so-called change of style, musicals declared their retreat. Those writers who suffered misfortune also returned to their hometowns dejectedly.</p>
<p>But now it has been revived. Eddie Cantor's "The Kid From Spain" can be considered a sign of easing this ailment. Warner's "42nd Street" 42nd Street is like a tonic, and it has restored the heavy morbid state. It is said that the Hollywood production companies are now excited about the production of musicals again.</p>
<p>Following "42nd Street," Warner has produced another film, "The Gold Diggers of 1933," starring Al Jolson's wife, Ruby Keeler, as well as Ginger Rogers, Warren William, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and other famous actors. It is another musical film with both sound and color. MGM is also planning to release a new "Hollywood Revue" (similar to the one released in 1929), starring Jack Pearl, Jimmy Durante, Jean Harlow, and others, directed by Edmund Goulding, who directed "Grand Hotel." They also want to find a way to remake "The Merry Widow," which was originally starred by Jeanette MacDonald a few years ago. Paramount has now completed "International House," starring W. C. Fields, Stuart Erwin, Sari Maritza, and others. Bing Crosby's "College Humor" is currently in production. RKO is also rushing to produce "Melody Cruise." In addition, they are opening up a new path, turning the customs of the Czechoslovakian welcome festival into a unique and grand musical film. The lovely European actress Lili Damita and John Boles will soon complete "My Lips Betray" for Fox. Jean Gaynor and Tinley Garato's "Adorable" will also be released in due course.</p>
<p>The girls who are good at singing and the artists who write poetry are about to have good luck. Some well-informed people are already carrying their suitcases, preparing their bedding, and preparing to set off from Tin Pan Alley.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Two Orphans"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>If it is said that Chinese films have made great progress, then this is the time when film writers cannot be complacent and critics should take on more responsibility. A few films with backward technology are more worthy of our serious attention. Because this will indeed help them improve in the future.</p>
<p>The performance of "Two Orphans," in any respect, cannot satisfy us. Here are a few points, in the order of the story's development, for sincere discussion with the gentlemen of the Lonely Star Company.</p>
<p>(1) Why did the military judge personally inspect the prison? The prison structure is too idealized. Too few prisoners. But the scene of the military judge beating the prisoners is good. Su Mei's visit to the prison lacked any sense of tension.</p>
<p>(2) The military governor's flirting and coercing of Su Mei are not enough. But it is also too much like a civilized play. Su Mei blinding him and remaining innocent is inevitably a material from a legendary novel. Wouldn't the violent military governor vent his anger on Xiao Feng because of this?</p>
<p>(3) Su Mei came out of the military governor's office, and the revolutionary army conveniently charged into the city, extremely coincidental. There was no smoke from artillery in the city, but Su Mei's house was inexplicably destroyed by artillery fire. Moreover, Su Wei immediately took out a clean package from the rubble. At the same time, the setting of the broken house and ruined walls is so fake that it cannot be more fake. Xiao Feng and Su Mei's sisters searched for each other but just happened to miss each other, extremely coincidental. There is a lot of drama to be played here, but it is all explained in one day like a horse race.</p>
<p>(4) From a certain county to Taojia Town, and from Taojia Town to Panjia Village, it is only a few dozen miles away, at most a two-day journey, why would the two orphans' clothes be so tattered, even barefoot and carrying mats, reduced to beggars. Moreover, the previous scene was great weather, and in the blink of an eye, it was a scene of heavy snow on the ground. Wide roads in small counties are also rare.</p>
<p>(5) Su Mei biting her finger to write words in blood is another dream of a legendary novel.</p>
<p>(6) The war scenes are too fake, on the one hand, there seem to be soldiers wearing steel helmets. Su Wei's rescue in the previous scene and her subsequent role as a nurse is too easy.</p>
<p>(7) The elder sister's fiancé, the younger sister doesn't recognize him?</p>
<p>The news of the elder sister's death does not have to wait until a scenic spot to tell the brother-in-law. The rear hospital of the battlefield has a garden with mountains and clear waters for love talk?</p>
<p>(8) Su Mei's reunion and marriage, Su Wei's clean withdrawal, should have foreshadowing before the flower presentation.</p>
<p>There may be others, but there is no need to list them all. The above points are all for well-intentioned discussion. However, there are also good things. Such as the scene when the two orphans let each other have cold rice in the pavilion. Footprints in the snow, Su Wei falling when she returns begging for food, etc.</p>
<p>In short, I think the biggest failure of this film is that it interweaves the plots of old stage plays with the themes of legendary novels, plus the style of civilized plays. The director pays little attention to the method of Montage. The screen continuity is like a series of pictures. The actors can only listen to the director's orders and act, with little expression. There are too many unnecessary subtitles. After finishing this article, I wish all the authors of "Two Orphans" to step up their efforts.</p>
<h3>Secrets in the Picture</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Produced by Yueming Company</p>
<p>Screened at Golden Grand Theatre</p>
<p>This story is so chaotic and complicated that the whole film fails to grasp a central theme. It is an old work by Yueming Company before it changed its style (before "Her Heart..."), the script is transformed from a play, so the whole film has some features of the new drama, but the playwright originally intended to be somewhat警世. For example: although both were bandits, after ten years, one reformed and gained a lot. One still obstinately persisted in evil, so he was "caught in the official prison," and at the same time, those who have once fallen are controlled by others everywhere, even their wives and daughters are淫 while they can only endure, showing the danger of a person's fall, and the explicit depiction of bandits is a specialty of martial arts films. When it was performed, I don't know why, it was always so chaotic, with so many unconscious actions and accidental coincidences that people just felt "This is watching a play". Whenever there is difficulty, the screen is省去了, sometimes represented by subtitles, most of the time there are no subtitles, so the film feels more monotonous, scattered and tasteless. The personality of the characters in the play is inconsistent. Most of the stories are untrue and not in accordance with 情理, there is a part of contradiction in the exposure, and the consciousness cannot be developed strongly, so the inner quality of the film is empty.</p>
<h3>A Bunch of Film Plans</h3>
<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>Tianyi Company will soon start filming "Forward" written by Yu Sijun. The heroine has been decided to be played by young sister Li, and the male role may be played by Tian Fang. The film is a war-themed film, the main purpose is to greatly inspire young men and women to love the country, and not to end up drowning in the abyss of wine and色. It is said that the director is Qiu Qixiang.</p>
<p>The new film of the Hong Kong Great Wall Film Company, "Return My Rivers and Mountains", takes the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents as its theme, and is a film to inspire the Chinese people to save themselves and love the country. It has now been publicly screened in Guangdong, and it is said that it will be transported to Shanghai for public screening soon.</p>
<p>Since the female stars of Tianyi Company formed a women's basketball team, the captain, Chen Yumei, gathers the team members to practice at the prescribed practice time every day, so the progress is extremely rapid. Yesterday, the team specially competed with the company's men's team. The competition ratio was implemented according to the women's competition regulations. The competition started at 3:30 pm and rested until 4:00 pm. As a result, the women's team suffered a big defeat, losing more than twenty points. However, the captain Chen Yumei expressed her disapproval at the time and agreed to a rematch in a few days.</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi, Li Zongren and other important figures in Guangxi are recently preparing to establish a film company, and have sent someone to Shanghai to hire photographers and recruit male and female actors. It is said that their debut work is "New Guangxi", using Guangxi's unique scenery as the background. It is said that Guangxi's mountains and rivers are the best in the world, and in the future, when this film is completed, it will definitely add a lot of color to the national films. Some people say, "This is a martial arts film, but the hero's夜行衣 and 薄底快靴 have been replaced by suits and leather shoes," which is not an exaggeration. Really, at first, the two fought each other, and then dozens of people fought together, making it difficult to distinguish and resolve. When an official soldier came, it was a happy ending. As for why the official soldiers came, the cause of the fight, whether there were idlers nearby to persuade them, and the strength of both sides, there is no need to ask at all, anyway, as long as it is fierce, it is considered to have reached the goal. What is the technique? The sunlight is so strong, but the small lens focus and aperture are not used, so it is so bright that it is dazzling. Sometimes the actors look like Africans. The interweaving of scenes is directly influenced by the director. This film's director is not good, and there is no need to talk about anything else. Too many outdoor scenes are taken, and the location is not well chosen, so it makes the space even more confusing for the audience to find their bearings, and the time is also conflicting. Makeup, interior scenes, and props are also very simple. The words in the subtitles are too many and too small, and they are really unclear.</p>
<p>Locke Bang's performance as the young man, except for the martial arts on the old stage, is not bad. Ma Fengqi is too civilized, although the performance is barely acceptable, it does not fit the identity. Wu Lizhu's work is light, but the expression is very difficult, the martial arts is "頂括括."</p>
<p>In short, this film may be a good film for people with general low-level tastes or those who like civilized plays, but there is no artistic merit to speak of.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Short News from Tianyi</h3>
<p>— Long Zi</p>
<p>The sound film "Struggle," directed by Biao Qixiang and starring Chen Yumei, with Hua Binghua and Wei Pengfei in supporting roles, and the silent film "Catkins," directed by Shao Zuiweng and starring Yuan Meiyun, with Bao Zhichao and Wang Huijuan in supporting roles, have both completed filming. They will be submitted to Beijing for review after editing.</p>
<p>The silent film "Forward," starring Hu Shan and Lu Xia, directed by Shao Zuiweng, and with Yu Si as assistant director, is a patriotic military film. It was recently filmed on location at Rongyuan Garden and will soon film scenes of a large army setting off and charging.</p>
<p>After starring in "Struggle," Chen Yumei will continue to star in a sound film. The script is already prepared, but the title has not yet been decided. The supporting cast will likely include Tian Fang, Xiao Zhengzhong, Zhang Zhenduo, Ma Loufen, and others. They will go to another city next week to film on location.</p>
<p>Lu Jianfen, who has been away from the film industry for many years, has recently joined Tianyi. It is said that a contract has been signed with a monthly salary of 200 yuan. Lu was originally an actress with Tianyi five or six years ago, but left the screen after getting married.</p>
<p>The sound musical film "Platinum Dragon," a collaboration between Tianyi and Southern Film Company, is directed by Tang Xiaodan and stars Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing. The film was completed some time ago and submitted to the film review board. Because the Cantonese parts had to be translated before review, it was delayed for a long time. It has now been approved and should be released soon.</p>
<p>The script for "Dawn," starring Liming Hui, has been revised and will be filmed soon, directed by Shao Zuiweng. After "Dawn" is completed, Liming Hui plans to co-star in a film with all the young actresses from Tianyi, Shao Suxia, Shao Suxue, Shao Sumei, Chen Qixia, Chen Jingfang, and others. The film will be titled "Little Sisters."</p>
<h3>"Little Toys" Has Completed Filming</h3>
<p>— Meng Gan</p>
<p>"Little Toys," directed by Sun Yu of Lianhua Second Studio, stars Ruan Lingyu, Li Lili, Yuan Congmei, and Han Langan. The play argues that "China's toy industry only knows how to stick to old ways and does not know how to improve." The content depicts the sorrow of someone who works with "little toys." Filming has taken nearly two months, and location shooting took place in Wuxi for many days a month ago. It has now been completed and is being edited. It is said that it will be released at the Beijing Grand Theater in this city at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Film Novel Reunion in Vienna (10) Translated by Zi Gui</h3>
<p>"I have many important things to say. Let me start from the beginning, I came to woo your wife. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I understand very well," said Anden.</p>
<p>So Rudolf continued, "I have known Elena for ten years. When I say 'known', I hope you understand that we are..."</p>
<p>"I understand everything about the past," Anden hurriedly stopped him.</p>
<p>"Our romance was unfortunately interrupted by the revolution. For ten years, I have felt empty without her. Recently, I decided to return to Vienna to see her. But now that I see her, my desire for her has become even sharper. These are some of the facts we all need to resolve."</p>
<p>"If this matter can be handled reasonably," Anden said, "it is easy to resolve. You want to see her, you can look at her as much as you want, fill your imagination with her. Then you can see for yourself that she has no substance for you, like a dream that has disappeared and cannot be collected again. But in fact, I am afraid it cannot be so simple."</p>
<p>"You are right, my friend," said Rudolf, "things are not so simple. I cannot be satisfied with just looking."</p>
<p>"Anden, what should we do?" Elena asked.</p>
<p>"I don't have anything to do," Anden said resolutely. He suddenly turned to Rudolf. "You are forcing me to be a jealous husband!! I ask you to leave immediately!"</p>
<p>Rudolf did not expect the sudden change in his opponent's attitude, while Elena watched coldly as the two men's mental battle gradually progressed to a physical one. They took off their coats. Rudolf waited spiritedly for his opponent's attack. Anden suddenly retreated a few steps, shaking his head and saying dejectedly, "You can have your way. I was fooled by you. I have a thousand excellent reasons to kill you, but this situation is too embarrassing for me. In front of my wife, I must set an example. I cannot do this. I can end this fight, but I cannot start it."</p>
<p>"No, Anden, you are wrong," Elena said. "Even you cannot end this fight, only I can end this fight. I should have understood earlier and should not have run away from the Hotel de la Rue. I always take the wrong step, that's my fault." The doorbell suddenly rang, and Bafaluomo rushed in and said, "The police are here!"</p>
<p>"What are they here for?" Anden asked.</p>
<p>"They are here to arrest him," Elena said. (To be continued)</p>
