<p>時評</p>
<h3>過去一年之回顧</h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>一九三三年一月初一。破壞世界和平之砲聲。卽自遠東之一角丨山海關彼方發出。此一彈也有類乎薩拉傑之一彈。其情形之嚴重亦極相類。世界列國多集中其視綫於遠東政局之變化矣。然而事實之昭示似有出乎一般預料之外者。卽山海關問題生之後。此一砲彈之爆炸力。僅及於灤河東岸。而集注視綫於東方之列强。亦止於集注視綫而已。並無更進一步之表示。迨乎熱河問題。隨山海關砲聲以繼起。當熱河砲聲隆隆之日。正日内瓦軍備縮小會議開會之時。吾人不必研究此軍縮之技術問題如何。而對此一面砲火掀天。一面高談道義。已屬天下無雙之奇事。足以證明軍縮前途之暗淡矣。吾人固知國與國間之糾紛。唯有武力乃可解决。不過在此顦頭爛額困苦掙扎之中。差足自慰者。世界正義尙未完全埋没。卽二月二十四日之國際聯盟大會决議。以四十二票之一致。宣告所謂［滿洲國］。確爲僞造並確認十九委員會所製作之報告及勸告。雖無實際之拘束力但尙可以表示世界一般輿論也。　　繼此以後。世界情勢。愈趨惡化經濟恐慌之危機。次第暴露以北美合衆國據有幾及世界所有黃金之半數。竟於新總統羅斯福就任之始。發生空前未有之金融風潮。甚至全美國銀行停市百萬富翁。一夕之間變爲赤貧此種事變。其影響於世界爲何如乎美國之放棄金本位採取通貨膨脹政策。殆爲必然之勢。</p>
<p>世界經濟旣因美國金融恐慌而受極大之震撼。則前程究竟何如。卽當事諸人。亦多所危懼。先進諸國顧慮尤甚。是以視世界經濟會議。爲解决當前困難問題之樞紐。假使各國眞能抛棄以往之成見。而實行國際合作者。則生産恊定可以成立。消售市塲或可均等。貨幣匯兌等類技術問題。自不難求得適當之解答。當前之經濟難關。亦未必不可打破。無如終以諸國歷史之糾紛過深。利害衝突過烈。遂至國際合作僅成爲外交上應酬之詞令。而經濟的國家主義。乃成爲經濟聯盟之根基矣。戰債問題。旣不能於經濟會議中求解答。通貨膨脹與穩定國際匯兌。又成互相對立之局再加以關稅壁壘之不易减低。而各國之裂痕。卒因此而更加深化。</p>
<p>當此時也。美國惟有竭力鎭定其旣已暴露之恐慌。英國則從事於其帝國内經濟聯盟之鞏固。法國則欲執歐洲金融之牛耳。德國急圖經濟上之出路。日本仍繼續其軍事冒險政策。蘇聯亦由冷靜旁觀而轉致力於戰備。東方問題表面上似成潛流。而實際則愈轉惡化。民國二十二年。雖勉强過去。然凖以往艱難困苦之經騐與敎訓以測將來。吾國在此四面緊壓之下。對於來年。其將如何努力以消滅當前之危機乎。</p>

<h3>李維諾夫嚴詞痛斥日本背信向俄挑釁</h3>
<p>用詭譎手段謀攫中東路</p>
<p>日政策爲國際政治陰霾</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄外委李維諾夫今日向中央執行委員會報告國際局勢、直斥日本之背信、謂日本曾允不使滿洲俄人之利益受損、蘇俄深信其言、不意九一八事變起後、日本卽直接攻擊蘇俄之利益、並妨害中東鐵路之營業、日本欲得中東鐵路而爲一種蘇俄所贈之禮品、故乃不惜以詭譎手段兾藉警察莠民與滿洲自衛之助、攫奪該路、俄日關係現爲全世界所注意、因日本之政策、實爲國際政治天空中至黑暗之陰霾也、李氏以美滿論調言及中俄邦交之恢復、但惜中國外則仍受鄰敵之侵略、内則復有嚴重之紛爭、李氏又謂日本厚集兵力於滿洲邊界附近、致危及蘇俄疆界、蘇俄不得不遣派大宣以固邊防、蘇俄並不威脅日本、但日本之第一步驟、必須以事實表明其意志之和平、日本必須停止其在中東路上之强暴的警察活動、恢復已被侵犯之蘇俄權利、重開中東路公平買賣之談判、並簽定兩年前蘇俄所提議之互不侵犯條約、今吾人有一種印象、滿洲境内之日當道、顯然欲激成嚴重勝於抗議之行爲、蘇俄目前僅採行守勢的計畫、而日本卽凖備侵略的戰爭云、李氏旋將德國與日本相提並論、並發警告社會黨之詞、謂國社黨如欲實現其殖民於烏克蘭或他處之夢想、則蘇俄政府必與之對抗云、李氏末乃言及日内瓦、謂軍縮會議或暫可復活、但縱能復活、亦不過爲重置軍備而非縮减軍備之會議、必各國不復視互不侵略條約爲廢紙、則軍縮問題方可有眞正之討論也、蘇俄政府在此種情勢之下、不得不增厚而改善其必要的國防、因蘇俄難保不遇有一種時期、而須保持史丹林所發蘇俄必不以寸人讓人之宣言也云云、（路透）</p>
<p>俄外長演辭全文</p>
<p>（莫斯科）今日外交人民委員長李維諾夫在中央執行委員會大會席上報告國際情勢及蘇聯外交政策、李氏詳述國際生活發展之現階段、並稱資産階級之和平主義時代已成過去、日内瓦外交談判與會議之中心問題、已非軍縮、而爲擴充與重整軍備、同時新起政黨新起派别以及新起人物、俱隨新的軍事精神挾新起意識形態以興起、此種新起政黨宣告反共運動、唯彼等在此種奮鬥之掩護下、暗中進行範圍極狹之國家主義的企望、卽修改條約以及攫取領土是、而其修改也、無論條約明文規定、或竟並及載及者均屬之、李氏續謂、［如戰爭之幸運一旦向彼等微笑、則彼等將不局限於爲彼等疾惡之馬克斯主義者所執掌之領土、且將涉及資産階級之領土、雖由抱負同様思想之統治者所統馭之領土亦所不免、此卽某一歐洲國家之情形也、同時復有一國家、毫不假借心理的乃至理論的複雜凖備工作、自始卽以邊疆之修正撤換恊定之修正、其進行也、不用外交家而惟將軍是賴、此等將軍總率各軍馳騁於茫茫無垠之亞洲大陸、視一切邊界與衆人之利益若敝屣、］（中略）李氏續稱、［蘇聯外交政策之關鍵、已爲史丹林氏簡峭之公式盡情表現、卽吾人不欲外國之領土、唯吾人亦不願喪失吾人之寸土、故吾人絶不希望戰爭云云、至於我國領土、則吾人已能以日益增長之軍事力量保障之、且能令外力不敢趨近覬覦、此種軍事力量並能敎訓吾人之遠近鄰居、在數十年内彼等安居於自己之邊界内可也、吾人爲努力與各建立並維持友誼計、故集中注意與世間眞願維護和平、同時凖備反對破壞和平分子之國家鞏固邦交、並實行最高度之親善、在過去與現在吾人絶不拒絶國際間有組織之合作以保衛和平、吾人絶不拒絶運用此等現存或得以形成之國際恊會與組織、如吾人持有理由深信此等組合乃有益於和平者、</p>
<p>與美土法意維親善　李氏述及蘇聯與各國之關係時、首自美國說起、彼謂美國意欲維持和平、深信其與蘇聯之交善、得爲保持和平之有力因素、故異常重視美蘇兩國在此方面之合作、至於吾方、亦自維持和平而重視此事之視點出發、認爲美蘇復交富有價値、李氏述及土耳其時則稱、［吾人以爲蘇土邦交爲吾人與列國邦交之模範、友誼與互信之政策在國際政治上、亦能締建有效合作之基礎、如某一方面提出鞏固和平之建議時、卽能預先獲得對方之援助、如各國民間俱能建立此種關係、斯和平問題解决矣］、李氏續謂、［吾人叙述與其他國家關係之漸進而重要之增進時、當首論法國、本年吾人與法國之關係有巨大而迅速之前進、蘇法之聯合乃由眞誠企求和平之共同意願所維繫、吾人初無須顧慮法國政府之屢經更替、得影響於此種密切關係之順利發展也、最近赫禮歐與谷特之來蘇聯、更予法蘇親善以新的動力、予意此項親善之進行、必將更爲迅速、因威脅和平之分子現在匯集也、吾人與意大利之邦交、十年來異常穩定、無論在經濟或政治問題上、均未嘗起有變化或有所緊張、當予最近訪問意國時、曾受熱烈之歡迎、此點已足證明兩國俱願發展其在經濟與政治方面之關係、</p>
<p>英俄邦交未臻穩固　唯至爲不幸者、吾人願與各大國增進邦交之期望、對於英國竟未能充分實現、蘇英關係尙欠穩定、因英國内部現時尙有夢想以資本主義之聯合鬥爭、反抗社會主義國家之分子也、唯吾人願望此次行將簽訂之臨時商約、得令增進英蘇邦交成爲可能、</p>
<p>積極推進睦鄰政策　李氏述及蘇聯鄰國時、則謂不侵犯約及侵略國定義公約之簽訂、已增進蘇聯與波蘭間之互信與諒解、彼力稱兩國間存有共同之利害關係、此種關係、又爲兩國共同危險與煩惱之産物、［如吾人與波蘭並不自覺此種煩惱之共通性質、則造作此等煩惱者復將鼓動吾人領略之［、李氏復述及蘇聯之東部鄰國、謂蘇聯之與波斯與阿富汗已由不侵犯約相維繫、同時加拉罕波斯之行、更令蘇波關係有特别友善之可能、蘇聯與小恊約國雖無正常之外交關係、唯兩者之間已簽訂侵略國定義公約、此項公約表示簽約國家俱有維持歐洲和平之願望、同時與羅馬尼亞之意見參錯、迄今尙未解决、此事更使上述公約成爲重要、至於蘇聯與瑞典·丹麥·諾威·奥國·希臘·等國一向維持正常之邦交、且從而增進之、與西班牙之關係則已甦生、</p>
<p>同情中國内憂外患　李氏述及蘇聯與中國之復交時、則表示滿意、且謂蘇聯已接受中國政府願意締結不侵犯公約之建議、而蘇聯對於該約之草案、亦正由中國政府審查中、氏對中國猶爲一國外敵人所侵略、同時又有深刻之内亂表示遺憾、</p>
<p>對德民族不含敵意　李氏在結束其對於蘇聯國際地位之一瞥時、復詳述蘇聯與德日兩大國家之關係、首論德國、氏謂十年來德蘇兩國在經濟及政治方面、向有密切之關係、且兩國俱受此種關係之賜、直至本年德國方面發現種種違反以前邦交之演說聲明與行動、遂使邦交惡化、李氏請聽衆追憶下述思想之存在、卽以槍刀武器爲德國之向來擴張開拓大道、而奴隸蘇聯之國民、身居負責地位之人員屢作反蘇聯性之建議與談判、且賴上述之思想系統而益趨活躍、李氏於此、重提德國當局對於蘇聯機關與公民所施有系統之虐待、有人企圖將德蘇邦交之轉變、歸咎於蘇聯不滿德國目下之政權、李氏則力闢此說之謬妄、氏云、吾人對於德國同志之備遭蹂躪、自抱同情、唯吾儕馬克斯主義者决不以感情駕馭政策而受人指責、舉世咸知吾人能與任何政府下之資本主義國家保持良好關係、卽法西斯政府下之國家亦然、德國政治家曾問我曰德國將如何而消釋蘇聯關於德國態度之懷疑乎、予恒答曰、［德國須停止現在之作爲、德國政府須通知其屬員停止其現在之作爲］、吾人願與德國及其他國家保持最良好之關係、吾人不圖在東方或西方作任何擴張、吾人對於德意志民族絶無敵意、且絶無侵佔彼等領土與權利之企圖、吾人復絶不鼓勵他國作此種企圖也、吾人希望德國能向吾儕作相同之聲明、並希望所發生之事實毌與此背道而馳、同時希望此種性質之聲明、不僅指現時而言、且能在德國具有更大之力量實行其侵略思想（此種思想在德國目下之領袖未執政前已在提倡現時復有人提倡之）之時亦屬有效也］、</p>
<p>日本挑釁忍無可忍李氏述及蘇聯與日本之關係時、則云此種關係已引起舉世之注意、因日本之政策實爲國際政治界中雷聲隆隆之烏雲、吾人在遠東部分幾無所謂國防、吾人之一向信任日本、一至於此、唯自日本在滿洲開始其軍事行動後、形勢則已大變、日本對此曾作種種空洞無物不能置信之解釋、日本政府曾正式而吾人擔保、卽吾人之利益特别爲吾人在中東路上之利益將不受損害、此種擔保曾一再聲明、同時日本軍隊繼續前進、直至彼等全部占領滿洲、且造成其所謂［滿洲國］之日爲止、是時乃不顧上述種種允許、遽向吾人之利益肆力摧殘、而鐵路之業務遂以中斷聞、當時全世界對於吾人之冷靜與忍耐均甚驚異、唯吾人愈加靜諡與忍耐、日本在滿當局之行爲乃愈無恥而挑釁、吾人以不願中挑釁之鈎、故願出售中東路、僅圖收回該路費用、唯在談判進行中、吾人已經證實日本不欲購買此路、僅願不費分文取得該路以爲贈品、日方代表不用口頭之談判、乃用持殊之方法、賴警察與在滿白俄犯罪份子之援助實行强佔鐵路、日人對此力稱、日本與此等非法行動絶無關係、對此負責者應爲［獨立］之滿洲國云云、李維諾夫力斥此說之無稽、彼謂［吾人及全世界述及此種獨立時、自有吾人自身之見解也、］</p>
<p>集軍邊境俄受威脅　李氏指明日本軍隊現正密集滿邊、軍事設備現正運置、公路與鐵道現正建築、後續謂、［此種威脅不僅對於中東路且對蘇聯之邊界、吾國政府乃不得不增强吾人之國防、運送必要之軍隊前往、吾人不願戰爭、吾人不願威脅日本、吾人所要求者卽彼亦能同様尊重吾人之權利與利益耳、</p>
<p>和平誠意應有表示日本如欲證明其和平之企圖、第一步應先停止中東路警察任意行動之政策、恢復吾方已被破壞之權利、嗣後乃繼續磋商中東路商業價格之談判、其第二步應爲締結不侵犯公約、吾人願如是希望日本之行動將遵照國内明達愛國志士之敏感之忠告、而不應聽從軍事冒險家之勸說、</p>
<p>國際軍縮反成軍擴李氏於結束此項報告時、述及軍縮會議、氏謂此項會議尙得視爲生存、且仍能復活若干時期、［唯此之不復爲軍縮會議、而爲重整軍備會議、當人們對於某一部分則論重整軍備、對另一部分則稱裁减軍備時、吾人則作如是疑懼、卽所能實行者僅爲此公式之第一部、而非其第二部、因大會决不能令若輩正在運用其軍備之國家裁减其軍縮、彼等且公開威脅在最近將來將以更大之規模、運用其軍備、各國俱能不以不侵犯約爲廢紙、斯吾人復能鄭重談判軍縮矣、吾人旣願與他國合作、故須牢記作爲吾人對象之資本主義國家其政府旣不穩定、且常更替、同時此等國家得由凖備犧牲民族利益之分子出而執政、</p>
<p>增厚紅軍力量防備或有攻擊</p>
<p>吾人在此不得不出而自衛之塲合、將加强並改進吾人安全之主要保障、卽紅軍紅色海軍以及紅色空軍一如往昔、且將更甚於往昔、吾人應牢記此點、卽雖有吾人之企望、而彼召喚吾儕證實史丹林氏所作吾人將不失寸土之聲明之時機必將到來、屆時則不僅紅色軍人、卽吾偉大聯邦之紅色人民俱將出而捍衛蘇聯東方與西方之寸土也、蘇聯人民在共黨與史丹林領導下、其在軍事方面必能保證其有與己經獲得之和平勝利具有同様規模之勝利］云、（二十九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>羅斯福和平演說</p>
<p>歐洲政局一服興奮劑</p>
<p>援助國聯反對擴軍</p>
<p>與法政策遙相呼應</p>
<p>（巴黎）美國總統羅斯福昨日之演說、爲法國人士所熱烈贊成、咸以爲美國解釋門羅上義日漸寬大、由羅氏昨日之演說更可見之、羅氏一方面援助國聯會、一方面反對軍備之擴充、且正式贊成國際上永久監察軍備制、可見美國對於國際各種重大問題、係與法國遙相呼應、昨日美國駐俄大使貝立特氏與法外次特德桑之會晤、尤足增加法國輿論之滿意、蓋貝氏乃羅斯福總統之至友也、法國輿論又以爲當德國要求重整軍備之時、羅斯福之演說、在全世界必將發生重大影響、尤以柏林爲甚、至於倫敦態度游移、羅馬反對國聯會之感想甚明顯、此兩首都聞羅斯福之言、亦必發生影響也、記者白禮農在［消息報］發表意見、謂［羅斯福之演說不啻一種興奮劑、吾人對於羅氏能不表示敬愛乎、現値美國内政多事之秋、負國家責任者艱難甚多、羅氏尙能對國際上作此種重要表示、已足令人敬佩矣、且民主黨前總統威爾之失敗、正由於參議院反對基外交政策、羅斯福於紀念威氏之日、敢於攫參院之鋒、其勇敢實有過人之處］云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅斯福演辭補充</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統昨日在［威爾孫基金］董事會發表演說、本社昨已報告、茲再將前電未盡之詞補誌如下、羅斯福總統將從前關於軍縮及抛棄侵略之建議重行節要叙述一過、</p>
<p>贊成監察制度卽（一）所有國家在若干年之内、逐漸廢棄攻擊性質之軍器、以後不再製造、但有權鞏固其邊防、俾持久而不變更、並有權永久由國際上監察鄰國之軍備、</p>
<p>對外不用武力（二）任何國家之武力不得逾越本國邊境之外、否則以侵略國論、訂立軍縮協定（三）須訂立正式恊定、以廢除侵略及侵略性質之軍器、</p>
<p>民族趨向和平羅斯福之謂、最近各種事變發生之後、吾人與前總統威爾遜之最終目的、不惟不能接近、反愈趨愈遠、羅氏之言曰、［淺見之流必謂軍縮之失敗、由於國家主義之發展、信如此說則、必到處之民衆均贊成國家主義而後可、顧以目下各國民族之趨向觀之、固不盡如此也、和平之所以發生危險者、其咎不在人民而在若干政治首領］、</p>
<p>特殊階級爲崇羅氏繼云、［全世界人口十五萬萬人中、予敢斷言至少有百分之九十、對於現在之疆域業已滿意、且如其他各國縮减軍備、則此等民族未有不樂於裁减兵力者、世界和平之危險、起於恐懼之心理、或者所餘百分之十之人民並無不和恊之處、所患者其首領欲侵略他國土地、以擴大本國領土耳、此等首領藉口種種理由、反對軍縮、甚至其他民族已贊成軍縮及互不侵略原則者、渠等且從而阻撓之、假如世界什九之人民能使其餘什一之人民主張自已之思想、而不受其首領之潘弄、則全世界永久有效之和平、必可成立矣］云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日内瓦方面滿意</p>
<p>（日内瓦）此間人士對於美國羅斯福總統昨日所發表之演說、大爲滿意、尤注重以下各語、卽［國聯會鼓勵各國簽訂互不侵犯條約、制成裁减軍備恊定、實可視爲世界和平之棟樑、美國非國聯會會員國亦無加入之意、但遇有非純粹政治問題以及其他問題、顯然足以代表世界全體民族之見地與利益、而非若干政治首領持殊階級之目的且非帝國主義之目的、則美國願與國聯會合作］云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>各報論調之一斑</p>
<p>（巴黎）羅斯福總統於前故總統威爾遜生辰所發之演說、法國各報對之均有微詞、時報對於國聯能力式微之言、雖表示同情、但責美國不肯以實力加入國際團、謂軍縮會議之失敗、多由美國太不活動所致、美國之拒絶批准凡爾賽和約或成立英美鞏固之陣綫以抗德國之進襲、實足爲世界和平組織之障碍云、晨報雖對羅總統之言論表示滿意、但其結語謂美國當勿忽視法國就其往日之經騐、不敢遽行接受其言、法國將以美國實在之行爲而不以美國悅耳之言論評斷美國之外交政策云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬意國各報皆歡迎羅斯福總統之演說、意大利日報謂其演說中之要點、實完全與意相墨索里尼意見脗合、尤其爲修改和約與軍縮問題二事云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統昨日在［威爾遜基金］董事會發表演說之後、美國方面最初反響極爲有利、僅［世界電聞報］略有不滿其言曰、歐洲及遠東戰雲密佈、含有嚴重之危險、羅斯福總統乃未作有更爲明切之指陳、未免美中不足］、所幸門羅主義有時爲美國用爲片面之工具、以便派兵前往新大陸各共和國者、羅斯福演說雖未明白加以指責、而對於如此解釋之門羅主義、則已一筆勾銷矣］、該報又謂美國對於拉丁美洲能無所沾染、然後對於日英法意各國之帝國主義·德國狂妄之希特勒主義·與夫以戰爲利之徒、始有仗義直言之餘地云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美趕造新式戰鬥機</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日金少將表示、美海軍正建造一種新式戰鬥機、以供試騐、該機裝超等雙馬達、可望成爲世界最速軍用飛機之一、（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）報載英政府擬爲軍縮事致牒德國之說、今日此間發表半官文告、指爲全屬無稽、（廿九日國民電）</p>

<p>班禪回藏問題、各方傳說不一、據班禪駐平辦公處消息、班禪已由百靈廟起程、刻在内蒙各地唪經、不久來平轉京、俟晤汪精衛後、再定回藏日期、至班禪回藏、後藏喇嘛、多半歡迎、但西藏旅平同鄕談稱、則以班禪回藏、尙舞把握、因班禪左右與達賴左右、感情不能融洽、如班禪願回藏、而其左右因利害關係、必勸班禪不回、若中央有相當辦法、則班禪方可安然而回云、</p>

<p>飢寒交迫難民待賑</p>
<p>立煌通信、赤禂皖西、數載於茲、金家寨爲其根據地、盤踞之時爲尤久、該地萬山環抱、形勢險要、位於史河南岸、卽麻河與白水河會流之處、雖無城垣、惟匪軍以當地爲豫皖耍地、死守弗退、且得當地農民之力助、致國軍迭次進剿、付以絶大代價、始告克復、中以衛立煌軍功最大、嗣後設新縣治時、始以立煌名縣、並劃鄂之長嶺關迤東、靑台關迤北、豫之龍旗山、臥牛山迤東、皖之葉家集迤南、東台嶺迤西爲界、城垣仍未修築、惟恃國軍所築工事、以資屏障、前隸河南、後始改屬安徽、</p>
<p>縣府組織、縣長外設一二三科、有科長二員、科員四員、事務員六員、書記六員、其第三科卽司法、科長由縣長自兼、秘書一員、原任病故、現尙懸缺未委、縣長嚴爾艾、軍人出身、勇於任事、所有佐治人員亦多軍人、敎建兩局、尙未成立、其事務皆由縣府直接主辦、關於公安之組織、僅於縣城設有分駐所一處、因經費無着、於每甲派民兵一名爲警察、每於夜間授以簡單警察常識、縣府政警法警共四十名、暫由保安隊撥充、尙無舊時差役之弊、政治組織不健全如此、而區保甲長、復輔助乏人、是以政治推進、極嫌遲滯、</p>
<p>自治自衛、在史河東岸編組保甲者、計第一區十六保、第二區五十三保、第三區三十五保、第四區十五保、第七區六十八保、此外五六兩區及一二兩區之一部、尙有匪共、未能編組、全縣有保安隊七隊、每隊人槍各九十、義勇隊每鄕均設置一聯隊、槍枝不等、統計全縣約有槍二千枝、保安經費、無所自出、最近省府補助六千元、每隊每月發給三百元、勉强維持、刻已將次用罄、曾由嚴縣長繼續請求補助中、</p>
<p>田賦今年已積極籌備開徵、惟轄境係由皖之六安霍山、鄂之麻城、豫之商城等縣、各劃一部所成、其田賦底册、除六安已造送外、餘皆遲遲未到、全部賦額、旣難統計、徵取額例、尙待考量、此外雖尙有財務委員會之組織、而公欵公産、尙未清理、實際毫無收入、必俟正稅確定後、並酌定附加、乃有收入之望、以故地方事業、多限於經濟、無從着手、聞該縣前隸河南、省府所給政費、尙能源源接濟、近自改屬安徽、乃以庫儲奇絀、援絶計窮、疊經該縣函電呼籲、層峯究以點金乏術、坐視其艱難搘拄、莫可如何、</p>
<p>地方敎育、縣城僅有國民小學校一所、經費由縣府政費撥充、並由縣府職員兼任敎員蔴埠流波䃥各有國民學校一所、皆無確定經費、更乏敎育人材、失學兒童、觸目皆是、在昔匪軍佔據時期、每一村落、據聞皆有列寗小學、而收復之後、竟未能廣設學校、以糾正過去赤化之心理、終屬難掩之疚憾、當地悹紳、偶語及此、無不面呈愧色、自慚不如、無怪自首自新分子、變詐反覆、悍不畏法也、</p>
<p>司法狀况、共匪案件較多、民刑案件絶少、監所無欵興築、因陋就簡、僅就署内房屋、覊押入犯、每人每日囚糧、發銀一角、最近軍事逐漸推進、收容難民及俘虜日多、旋奉三省邊區勦匪總司令訓令、令將各該收容人犯、組織牧牛·修路·炊事·收稻·割榖·砍柴·做鞋·縫紉·育嬰·等隊、以庽生産於賑濟中、然實際收效、亦極有限、三省勦匪總部金融救濟處、撥欵二萬元、籌組預備合作社、實行貸欵、但社長以其旣無恒業恒産、此項貸金、恐難收回、故不能不加考量、至使善政未能廣佈、此不特立煌縣爲然、恐其他各縣、亦未嘗不　同一情形也、</p>
<p>先後回境難民、無確實統計、據云爲數甚夥、日前留居於縣城附近者、尙有萬數、因與匪區僅一河相隔、災民困於衣食、且其田産房屋、俱在匪區、復因匪方裹脅難民、刧奪食糧、迫而偷渡、時所難免、雖有中央賑務會、派員施放振米、而若斷若續、未能周濟、收容婦孺興辦平糶及因利局等等、其振濟之數、什不及一、不特與匪區接近之難民無衣無食、卽較遠之區、自遭殘破之後、迄今究未解除痛苦者、比比皆是、此行所過各村、多見乞丐、追呼求乞、嗷嗷慘聲、不忍卒聞、何莫非顚沛流離衣食無着之難民也、</p>
<p>該縣交通、除史河航運可通縣城外、共他旱這、類多崎嶇不平不能改爲汽車道路間有興工修築處、亦因匪患未平、財力枯竭、旋興旋輟、其這難行、甚於蜀道、恐最近數年、尙難一免此嘆也、</p>

<p>山産以茶·麻·竹·木·鐵·紙·等項爲大宗、絲·油·漆·炭次之、在未赤化以前、民力充裕、號稱富庶之區、惟以交通困難、運輸不便、若能將一切生産、漸次改良、積極興闢道路、以利運輸、則三年而後、地方元氣、可望恢復、目前則以難民抛離田屋、無家可歸、而入數衆多、賑濟困難、不無遺憾、甚且無知之輩、反以匪方裹脅、刧奪食糧、尙可謀一時之生活、故不免潛回匪處、是誠可慮耳、</p>
<p>立煌設治伊始、萬端等理、應以開闢地目之、不能與一般縣治、等量齊觀、舉凡一般縣政之不良習慣、均不可使稍有沾染、貽害地方、其應率循舊規者、則應一一仿傚施行、縣政府與一切輔助縣政之機關、尤其對於敎育建設兩端、不能因地方無欵、任其廢置、農産衰落、農村凋敝、興復救濟、在在刻不容緩、難民衆多、振濟難周、在政府籌給鉅欵、煞費籌謀、縱使災民收受實惠、亦僅能勉支數日之糧、於生計仍無裨補、非根本從生産方面着手、不能救此災黎、倘事事困於經濟、一籌莫展、徒擁縣名、且遺隱憂、則有負設冶初心矣、</p>

<p>北市全體米行昨晨停斛風潮</p>
<p>失業工人從事摀亂</p>
<p>一度訓解旋卽平息</p>
<p>昨日上午八時許、北市各米行、正在派員斛米之際、突有大批失業工、人前往滋擾、各行覩狀、誠恐發生事端、立卽宣告停斛、並推舉代表向社會局要求制止、卽經該局派員前往視察、　並由公安局派警保護、故至上午十一時、風潮卽行平息、茲將各情分誌如後、</p>
<p>風潮起因</p>
<p>昨日之停斛風潮、　係起因於大批失業工人之攫奪工作、蓋北市米行、共有三十三家、平日購運食米、都由新閘橋畔之各客戶米船中斛取、該處客戶米船、每日至少在百號左右、平均每日斛米數量在萬担左右、因此之故、各米行均雇有車夫及工、人專事由米船上肩運至各行棧中、　並運輸至各處、此項工人、爲數共達一千五百餘人、終日營營逐逐、藉此爲生、</p>
<p>意圖覬覦</p>
<p>詎最近有名史登福者、忽對此項工作、意圖覬覦、　忽以開設上海市蘇州河鴻泰肩運公司爲名、向市公安局領得許可證、並在浦東方面、招致失業工人三百名、每人均身穿失業馬夾、擬將各行原有工人、槪予驅逐、以便安插此三百名失業工、</p>
<p>動武行兇</p>
<p>前日上午、史派此項工人、企圖前往工作、但原有工人、均因生活所關、自必不予退讓、而市北各米行、如永泰·恒大茂·裕盛·志成·等全體三十五家、亦不予贊同、因此史復派工人八名、向原有工人動武、幸被該處水巡隊查見、遂將行兇者、一併拘捕、轉解市公安局究辦、</p>
<p>昨晨搗亂</p>

<p>茲聞當夜（二十八日）十一時許海盜等旣將警士田鴻鶴擒住、但見餘警躍入浦江逃逸、料必回去報警、官警亦必前來兜勦、故山大頭目李克興帶領全體海盜、躍下停泊在該處浦面之火油船上、强迫船夥將船飛駛前往浦東後、卽一哄上岸、四散逃逸、内中海盜軍師施、文金、（卽王阿三）、則帶領小頭目李榮茂·海盜李小彩·王鳳翔·周金榮·李先春·李宗權·李見明·蔣阿三等九名·逃入浦東大龍橋沙泥灘地方鄕人李彩郎所居之草屋内潛伏、</p>
<p>鄕人察破</p>
<p>至於各人所佩之槍械、因奔逃時携帶不便、故有於紛亂時投入浦中者、亦有沿途抛棄者、所餘之駁壳槍及手槍等、則由軍師施文金指揮藏匿於附近石家港地方一棺材内、故官警等在吳淞口内外浦面團勦至東方發白、仍未見盜船影踪、惟至二十九日、清晨、大龍橋一帶鄕民、忽然發現李彩郎所居之草屋内、　突來面目猙獰之外鄕人多名、情知有異、急卽據情投報市公安局高橋三區四所、請爲偵查、</p>

<p>優遊西捕和局</p>
<p>５丨５優游以五比三佔先臨了西捕連中兩隻</p>
<p>優游西捕、昨戰於申園球塲、作甲組賽、查雙方隊中、均多一時名將、惟邇來西捕表演、急流勇退、較諸往日、咜叱風雲之雄風、已相差不可以道里計矣、但優游昨日之進攻退守、亦較平時爲遜色、結果造成五五和局、觀衆祇二百餘人、景象棲慘、茲略紀其戰列後、</p>
<p>三分鐘兩隻十二碼　　列陣之後、雙方兵戎相見、優游開球、孫錦順撥與锺勇森、提携而進、軋許半路邀擊、未生效果、吉勃生搶救出險、達爾反攻、黃瑞華回身不及、球至德飛脚下、闖入罰球區域、江善敬絆人違法、許德主踢、足到成功、開球再戰、優游五鋒、風起雲湧、頃卽入西捕内防、許德截住、不愼誤犯手球、照様被判十二碼、孫鐵腿砰然一射、頓呈秋色平分、</p>
<p>達爾頭頂建奇功　往來良久、各無建樹、軋許在衛線、屢次輸送砲彈、活更生被江善敬監視得太苦、幾無活躍之餘地、大塊頭透納奔跑不快、亦進攻時之絶大障碍、右翼别克騾悍驚人、屢次帶球進犯、梁樹棠視爲心腹大患、無何、别克又洶洶進犯、趕到低線、將球傳中、達爾躍起一頂、球竟彈入門線、</p>
<p>锺勇森又得一球　球此數造成二一之後、優游前鋒稍見振　作、孫鐵腿得老黃接濟盤旋進展、沈柏貴人小膽大、　雷糾𦆑不清、沈氏狡猾、急向中央輸送、吉勃生欲搶不搶、愛德門誤會陡生、锺勇森乘人不備、趕到開弓、又中紅鵠、孫鐵腿二度進窺、爲休脫殺退、活更生得勢入寇、透納射内爲竪柱彈出、而休息時間巳至、</p>
<p>風勢緊急一反三　下半時風雲緊急、活更生顯出當年身手、帶球載欣載奔、單刀直入、江善敬搶刦不得、活乃低射一記、唐永純欲守不得、欲下角竄進、孫中軍怒火爆發、立刻反攻、沈柏貴帶球至相當地點、交與小锺、休脫吉勃生兩騎奔出、前後夾攻、球入中路、鐵腿遙射、射</p>
<p>愛德門雖拍着、仍滑入門、三分鐘後梁樹棠刦獲來球、轉遞老孫、發腿又建奇功、俄頃孫氏帶球被軋許絆倒、就地傳球與鍾勇森、急盤進犯、　時闖入西捕腹地、搗入一球、成五對三之比、</p>
<p>西捕反攻成和局　五與三之後、觀衆莫不爲優游額手稱慶、方期勝利可以在望、孰知事出意外、透納一度急峻射門、爲門　擋駕之後、力乍推渡兩　、透納再射、終建一功、五分鐘後、軋許且盤且進、立刻闖過優游一關、交輿德飛、江善敬來搶短交、　　又送入門、成五五均勢而終塲、</p>

<p>海賊猖獗良華昨遭慘敗</p>
<p>塲地過小一籌莫展</p>
<p>小唐罰出全軍解體</p>
<p>丨四七比二五丨</p>
<p>良華籃球隊、昨晚七時、以二十五比四十七慘敗與西靑海賊隊、如此大敗、恐爲該隊歷史上之第一次、門票雖售一元及二元、然西靑健身房中參觀者、仍有五六百人、對良華之敗、無不表示惋惜、上半時十二比二十、形勢尙見緊張、下半時幾成一面倒之形勢、國人觀衆、對於裁判員仍多哨皮語、似良華之敗、皆裁判之過、此種表示、實不足以示愛護良華也、</p>
<p>用武無地</p>
<p>良華之表演、較之在中華籃球房中、判若霄壤、蓋西靑球塲較小、用武無、地加以西靑五虎包圍籃下、宛如肉屏風一座、勇猛如唐　堃、活潑如劉振之、坸無進窺機會、大有進退維谷、罔知所措、前十五分鐘、相持甚烈、軒輊難分、往後漸漸不支、而至下半時開發後、唐寳堃卽以四次犯規罰出、從此一　不振、至於巧妙之傳遞與投籃、更失却其時效矣、</p>
<p>相爭激烈</p>
<p>開賽後、海賊中鋒蘭英卽連得三分、良華不稍示弱、利用其巧奪天工之傳遞、但均被對手半路截去、幸藉罰球機會、攫得四分、再由劉振元投中一球、反以六比三導前、爲時無幾、海賊卡爾生罰中後、史密斯撈進一只、成六比六、雙方防禦、均甚鞏固、斯時巳賽十二分鐘、僅得六與六之比數、可見之相爭之激烈矣、</p>
<p>得分極難</p>
<p>良華暫停後、仍無起色、蘭英籃下托進成八比六、又前二分、唐寳堃努力奮鬥、在人叢中　前擲中、博得掌聲如雷、劉振之罰史規亞、再以九比八佔先、史密斯亦罰張景實、再九比九、斯時史規亞與張景實各記犯規三次、各有罰出之危險、形勢依舊緊張、後方防禦之堅密、均無深入籃下之機會、遠射咸無把握、故得分極難、</p>
<p>堅苦奮鬥</p>
<p>尹鴻祥衝前側射中的、蘭英亦加兩分、又成十一比十一、幾度堅苦奮鬥之後、良華漸見不支、雷池難越、用武無地、海賊方興未艾、氣燄如熾、史密斯與長脚蘭英、不時在籃邊托、分投遂漸分離、至二十比十二時、唐寳堃亦記犯規三次、岌岌可慮、上半時就此告終、</p>
<p>小唐罰出</p>
<p>再戰聲起沈聿勤代李震中出戰、良華鑒於不能深入營壘、乃改變戰略、隔山開砲、實行遠射、張景實初試成功、方以爲徐圖宏展、亡羊補牢、不料唐寳堃以四次犯規罰出矣、朱文極上塲替代、旋易李震中、觀察形勢、良華已兇多吉少、故觀衆鑒於小唐之罰出、無不異口同聲、嘆惜不巳、然全軍憤發、力圖反攻、精神抖擻、不稍示弱、起初尙能堅持奮鬥、入後終以弩末之勢、難挽狂瀾、</p>
<p>賊勢益猖</p>
<p>二十七比十六時、海賊虎將史規亞亦四次犯規罰出代以推　、軍容仍盛、卡爾生史密斯投籃如串珠、蘭英高人一頭、鷄羣鶴立、尤佔便宜、匹萊時出時進、勇猛如虎、而良華之張景實則小心翼翼、不敢多動、蓋隨時有罰出之虞、是以破綻時有、漏巵愈多、海賊無孔不入、打家刦寨、勢益猖獗、最後成四十七比二十五、歸海賊大勝、裁判康是雷特執法尙佳、惜嫌懦弱、缺少果敢之精神、</p>

<p>國專籃球隊自來滬後、初戰卽大勝復旦、該隊實力、可見一斑、昨晚七時、又與大同大學隊交鋒於大同體育館、由王錫九任裁判、開賽後、團專張長清、首開紀錄、吳文忠繼之建樹、大同戰士、一時束手無策、於四分鐘内、卽成十六對四、觀者無不相顧愕然、上半時終了、國專以二十二對十五占優、易防再戰、後局更顯緊張、惟大同軍馬求勝心切、反攻更覺猛烈、國專方面、乃時爲所乘、結果爲三六對三○、國專告捷、今日下午四時、再戰同濟大學隊於中華籃球房、當更精采表演、</p>

<h3>廢止賀年</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>賀年這一個名詞，我覺得根本有些欠通，［年］祇是計算時間的一個記號，積十二個月爲一年，正如積十公寸爲一公尺一般的平常得不足希罕，何必定要慶賀呢！依我個人的猜測，從前人的所以要有這一套賀年的把戲，也許是一種慰藉或勤勉的作用。意思是說現在又是另一個年頭的開始了，請忘掉了過去，努力打開一個新局面來吧！但是徵諸現在人的行動，都似乎絶對不是爲着這個意思。見了面，開口總是堆着笑的幾聲［恭喜］，書東往來，也總是［一一</p>
<p>恭賀新禧］四個字。我總不懂民國二十二年換了廿三年，我所得到的是什麽寳貴的東西，而値得人家一致向我道喜？我更想不透換了一個年頭，我的戚友們究竟全體升了什麽官，發了什麽財，必須要我向他們一一道喜呢？退下來想··反覺得日子過得這様快，一年又一年，某伯已將死了，某友也快老了，我向他們致弔不遑，何能再向他喊什麽［恭喜］，忍心欺騙他呢？至於我自己也很明白，寳貴的靑春，看看要給時間帶走了，我雖不能就說我是老了，然而每一個新年來到的時候，差不多都有一個暗示給我，說［你距離老的境界又近一步了！］一這様說來，凡爲我的親戚朋友，正該替我表示婉惜，爲什麽要替我慶賀呢？</p>
<p>至於說，人孰不死，距老死雖近，只要你的事業有進步，也値得慶賀。但是我敢說，在這個年頭，尤其是在中國，無論什麽的的事業都不用想有什麽進步，更不必希望有什麽進步·，如果你是一個不大敢用毒辣的手段，而且還没有忘記字典上還有人［人道］這兩個字的話，我相信無論是那一個新年的開始，祇不過是你的事業又將减退一步的徵象，要保持原狀也難，怎想有什麽進步。</p>
<p>綜納以上兩點看來，年的更換根本祇是人生歷程的路牌，多過去一年，便是距離死亡愈近一步，根本可悼而不可賀·，如果爲着慶賀彼此的事業的進展，在這個年頭，更是夢想。所以我主張，我堅决的主張，賀年一舉，必須立卽廢除！要是有人說賀年乃是慶賀一種新的環境或新的氣象的意思，那末我希望他在无旦日到閩浙交界的仙霞嶺上去聽聽砲聲吧！</p>
<h3>蘇州三好</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>顧亭林先生說··［北方之人，飽食終日，無所用心。南方之人羣居終日，言不及義。］雖是對明末清初的一般士大夫而言，但是看看現在的北方人，和南方人，還是這老様子，並無何等改善。王漁洋先生說··［吳谷有三好，鬥馬弔牌吃河豚魚，敬五通神。雖士大夫不免，恨不得上方斬馬劍，誅作俑者。］雖也是二百多年前的感慨語，可是二百多年後，也用得着。所不同者，只是馬弔牌改爲將牌而已。不過河豚魚喫了常閙出性命交關的亂子來，現在的蘇州人，已不敢喫了。五通神一禁於乾隆時代的湯斌，再禁於國民革命後的王引才，已不此從前的勢焰薰天了。現在士大夫家唯一的消遣，是馬將牌了，連那些太太奶奶們，也非此不歡。王船山說馬弔亡明，我說馬將亡［民］，不算過激罷。</p>
<p>因爲馬將牌的輸赢是小問題，耗費精神和時間是大問題。雖是鬥牌者都在公餘，並不妨碍他們的工作。但是一入牌局，諸事都廢，局終還要討論，研究。這無形的消耗，豈是數字能够記出來的。</p>
<p>至於喫，本來算蘇州人最考究了。但是現在遠不及上海人了，因爲上海可稱無所不備，無奇不有，只消有血，什麽都可以嘗一個新兒。不過蘇州人近來對於雅片烟的陷阱，還是繼續不斷地走進去，眼見許多靑年，都染了這癖嗜，不久就开容憔悴，這比河豚的毒要加上幾千百倍咧。</p>
<p>至於敬神，並非五通，却是［摩登之神］。無論男女，所營營終日者，都是爲了摩登。尤其是那些靑年，更是一點不肯落在人後的。所以儘管說國貨年，他們都不管，要是說亡國年，他們還是要摩登。並且他們所企求的摩登，只是物質的裝飾，顧先生和王先生倘然生在今日，要怎様的感慨！</p>
<h3>慢爺</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>［慢爺］兩字，是俗不可耐的一個名詞·，其實［慢］和［快］相對待，［快］不過佔了先，那末，［慢］就落了後罷了！所以［慢爺］從雅些稱呼，也簡直是［後父］，没有什麽希奇·，譬如一個丈夫，它的老婆亡了，不到幾時，又討了一個老婆，它前妻所生的了女，不能不認是［母親］，名義上就呌［後母］，那末，一個孤孀，它的男人死了，後來，又招别個男人當丈夫，俗稱［塡房］·，但是這個孤孀，並非獨身，前夫在時，已生有子女，這子女輩，倘呌起母親現在的丈夫是什麽？那末，就是本身顧了面子，不肯去呌它，那旁人的眼光看起來，總是同様的口氣說一聲，是它的［慢爺］啊！·</p>
<p>前幾天，有一個姓陳的，姑隱它的名字·，它年紀巳三十餘歲了，也娶了妻，起先在滬做生意，倒也十分幸運，手裏可有五六千的積蓄，所以在家享著福，就不想向外發展，以爲富家翁自待了·，那知［坐喫三年海要空］，它的家况一日不如一日，於是心血來潮，有火發弗出，竟拿起一把斧頭來去殺［慢爺］，這一回事，閙得城中沸翻盈天的，不曉得怎様可了·，事出後，就捉到公安局裏去，並且又移同法，本來是一椿血案，豈可以糢糊了事呢？咦！不料個中狠有趣味的妙文在後面，把它寫出來，也是無情無理的裏頭，偏含著至情至理的意義，就在這件案裏看出！</p>
<p>一個姓陳的，闖了殺［慢爺］大禍！［慢爺］頭破血流在醫院裏施了手術後，性命可以保個不死·，而執刀殺人的總不能不到看守所關起來，一到這時，它的母親也不由得哭起來，說道··殺吾夫者，吾兒也，今吾夫未死，而吾兒入獄，非特不可以對吾兒，且何以對吾前夫·，吾兒前夫所生，今所殺者，非吾兒之父也，唉！其咎在吾，但吾愛吾兒，吾又不能不愛吾夫，］遂倩人勸被殺者撤回訴狀，一面想法營救犯案的出獄·，以前看［慢爺］像陌路人，現在它的女兒和媳媳，朝夕到醫院去慰問，並親親切切的肯呌一聲［爹爹］了·，照此，［慢爺］吃了幾刀，是做著實了爲父的名分，而姓陳的借刀是代母親下了一個證婚書，這豈不是一件狠好笑的新聞麽？</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<p>丰姿絶世的美人，像嫣紅姹紫的春花。但春光易逝，春色易老，春花也易萎，故紅顔多薄命。</p>
<p>滿腹經綸的名士，像皎潔明媚的秋月。但秋景蕭疏，秋光易逝，秋月也易缺，故名士多潦倒。</p>
<p>人生的過程，分三個時期。過去，猶如在築路時期。現在，是通車時期。未來，是開足速率。快趕前程時期。</p>
<p>戀愛的過程，也分三個時期。過去，是甜蜜時期。現在，是嚼蠟時期。未來，是苦辣時期。</p>
<p>古人有秉燭夜遊，花前覓句，月夜尋詩的韻事。今人則在電炬通明之下，［不須秉燭］，或作竹林之遊，或作佚邪行爲，通宵達旦，鞠躬盡瘁，比古人之秉燭夜遊，相差遠甚。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回絮語燈前苦心訓弱息杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>至於男女平權自由，交朋友那一番話，究竟不好。交朋友是爺們的事，房門裏的人管理家務是本分，交朋友幹什麽，好呢，人家說你一聲喜歡自由。不好呢，這話可就難說了。唉······江氏夾槍帶棒，拖泥帶水，這様說了一陣。桂枝自己作事，自己心虛，爲何不懂，便更是紅了臉，只管低了豆坐着，將桌上放的兩張小報，不住的折來折去。江氏這也就知道自己的言語，已經射中了桂枝的心病，也就不再說什麽，拿起懷裏的衣料，又縫紉了幾針。但是他也僅僅只縫紉了幾針，復又放了下來，繼續着自言自語的道··並非我嘮叨，這個年頭兒，養活閨女，是最難的一件事了。守緊了，人家會說你頑固，老古套。這話又說回來了，這一分年月，你守緊了也得成啦。再說你放鬆一點兒罷，眞說不定會出什麽是非。現在的人，口都是毒的。閙的不好，還要跟你登上報。這些话比以前所說的話更重，桂枝的臉皮，更是猪血擦抹了似的連眼皮子都紅了，他耳朶上墜下來的兩片耳環，更是搖搖不定。江氏將眼偷覷了他一下，不曾說什麽，再低下頭作事。桂枝受了母親這兩叚批評，明知他是有所指的，但是自己如果不作聲，那就是承認着這話。雖然母親不是外人，但是自己默認了母親的話時，倒以爲自己眞不爭氣，有什麽外遇，那可背着寃枉了？於是故意裝成一種生氣的様子，將報紙向前一推，突然的站立起來道··你這不是笑話嗎？聽你的話音倒好像我有什麽要不得的事情，讓你看到了一様。這不是人家說東家長西家短，可是你自己說東家長西家短。（二八二）</p>

<p>糧食　河下米市無榮辱</p>
<p>▲滬北因肩運夫與小車夫衝突早市停斛</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮到船仍稀、共祇三十餘號、而零躉兩胃有限、客帮包胃、僅南洋·厦門帮採蘆墟厚粳一儎、數約百餘包、及上棧者進松江晚稻一儎、百十餘包、且兼本街店胃亦祇爲補缺添備、形勢清淡、市况依舊平平、各帮厚粳晚稻及杜洋尖等行情俱無軒輊、陰元供求頗合、亦無榮辱　（滬北）各路來源二十餘號、市上各貨去胃、因碼頭肩運夫與小車夫互爭肩米事、致早市停斛、午市方有同行開斛、各貨做開寥寥、市與昨相仿　　客秈續有閩化</p>
<p>丨丨江西機米新到四千五百包丨丨</p>
<p>昨客秈市况、因本客巳有問訊、人心與市價均居平定之局、昨閩帮胃口稍活、福州帮與泉州帮均有辦裝、本街亦稍問津、惟囤戶尙擬撳小若干、再爲過問、本街有河下到米、進胃亦不及閩帮活、本街祗去蕪湖機元米一百三十六包、價七元七角、泉州去湖南機紅米一百六十包、價六元八角、福州帮辦去湖南糙靖一百三十包、價五元七角半、江西機早米九十包、價六元三角二分、江北機米三百五十包、價六元九角、售價與前日相似、其他均無交易、申地存米仍有十三萬包以上、湘米占多數、惟江西米昨日新到機早機晚共四千五百包、貨主因市面平平、尙未完全出様、　　大連豆到銷俱有</p>
<p>大連黃豆、自加稅以來、只包未到、近來連市慘跌、合申能符、故上月迄今、巳運抵四五十車、市價尙平、前昨共成去十餘車、售價昨市仍開四元四角半、成交四車、又汕頭帮辦去牛莊白眉豆五百包、價亦開四元四角半、該豆隨到隨銷、市况無所謂榮辱、車輪各豆市氣雖平穩、但脚地不穩、因蚌埠候車裝運之豆、大有可觀、致人心尙不穩定、昨日銷胃、計廠家出口内地本街共成交各豆八九車、市價惟中次貨續升二三分耳、</p>
<p>上海之小麥銷場　中·</p>
<p>南人食米、北人食麥、小麥在南方市塲上、爲雜糧之一宗、不能與米比、自最近十餘年來、南方的小麥、尤其是上海居然占食糧中重要地位、此爲機製麵粉業發達之結果、亦嗜好變遷之一證也、</p>
<p>在民國十年以前、小麥大抵尙能勉强自給、偶有輸入、亦屬少數、呆自民國十一年起、情形大非、至最近之兩年、在民國二十年有二千二百餘萬担、二十一年亦有一千五百萬担、此爲全國進口量、但其大部分則銷於上海、故上海之與洋麥、有密切之關係、</p>
<p>至上海需要大宗洋麥、正爲上海一帶（連無錫而言）製粉業几、屹然爲全國冠、製粉業爲求粉色及出粉分量之凖確起見、不得不多用洋麥、加以本麥本身的墮落、及出産之减少、更予洋麥以推銷之機會、試觀下表下爲對照、便見洋麥之與上海之關係也、（單位千担）</p>

<p>是以小麥增加進口稅、上海粉麥商人最先感覺痛苦、若爲保護本國農産而增稅、原爲一般人士所切望、但觀於政府祗頒布小麥徵稅之命、不聞至如何時間而有免稅之許可、此其徵稅、注重收益之成分居多也、</p>
<p>上海一方面旣需要大宗小麥、他方面亦需巨量本麥、本麥之來源、裝自江海輪舶、其數量見於關册、若江浙内地所産、及皖淮之麥由火車來滬者、均爲關册所未及、下列數字、就關册所載而爲編製、巳屬可觀、設並關册所未及者亦能統計、量必更鉅、下表乃就各關本麥進口靜數與上海之進口數一爲比較、但其數量則年見修削、適與洋麥進口年增相反也、表如下、單位千担、</p>

<p>絲茶　歐美絲市難望轉機</p>
<p>（内地存繭運滬求售）　滬市絲廠業以入秋以來、廠經外銷停滯、絲價慘跌、爲自有絲市以來罕有之衰落現象、各廠存絲山積、無法支持、紛紛宣告停業、蘇浙兩屬絲廠同業公會、一再開會集議、當經决定呈請政府設立絲業統制會俾資救濟外、並組織聯合推銷處調查各埠存絲、餘繭數量、以便設法推銷、滬市存繭本祇五萬四千六百十四担、嗣因内地同業將存儲無錫等埠之乾繭、運滬求售、致滬埠存繭頓增八百零二担、現存共達五萬五千四百十六担、</p>
<p>（輯里乾經美銷仍滯）　輯里經美銷停滯已久、入冬以來、走銷仍無轉機、最近一旬中美郵祇有白乾經十包、裝往紐約、</p>

<p>（黃白粗絲印銷寥落）　海外生絲市塲實銷不動、紐約生絲交易所因多頭側重賣出、價仍立住、英倫日絲充斥、華絲價昂、無人問訊、滬埠去電均仍不轉、市氣寂靜、黃白粗絲印銷寥落、昨祇克昌等進黃搖經四包、　絲三包、乾經五包、價仍平疲、</p>

<h3>過年</h3>
<p>— 余揚靈</p>
<p>聖誕節的前夜，在霞飛路上所看到的許多外國男女，大抵有點熙熙然。但也有羨望着輝煌的破璃櫃内的玩具不肯過去而被父母拉開的孩子，因而覺得［普天同慶］的佳節，現在到底還没有。</p>
<p>從外國人的過聖誕等於中國人的過年這一節，又想到我們也要過年了。但因爲住在都市裏，年紀又比小孩子大了一點，所以對於過年這事巳没有多大的興味，最有興味的過年，總要算住在鄕村裏的兒時。</p>
<p>鄕村裏花様特多，從二十三夜送灶神上天起，便入了過年的節期，小孩子們，從此就每天有得熱閙，有得吃，只是不曾穿上新衣而已。大人們可不然，他們雖然也從此有得熱閙，有得吃，但在第二年元旦以前那幾天，他們還得忙，還得愁，尤其是三十夜這一個最後的日子，討債，還債，借債，避債，總要閙到夜裏三四點鐘。</p>
<p>倘是窮人，欠了債的，那麽三十夜是一個極難過的閙頭。</p>
<p>駡，打，剥衣服，搶家具······種種恥辱與苦痛，是窮人們在三十夜逃不了的功課。他們只好忍耐，忍耐到天明。</p>
<p>到天明是大年初一了。然而奇怪，一兩點鐘以前因爲還不出錢而被駡，被打，被剥了衣服搶了家具的窮人們，這時却穿上一件補綴較少的衣服出門了，這件衣服裏面一定是藏有錢的，數元以至數十元。</p>
<p>帶了這些錢是去賭博，賭博是窮人們在新年唯一的娛樂，而且，新年起頭的五天，是［皇賭］，誰也不來禁你的，趁這機會，他們要盡情地樂一下。</p>
<p>不還債而被駡被打不在乎，被剥去衣服搶去家具不在乎，甚至讓妻孥挨餓也不在乎，過年時節，［賭本］是無論如何要預備好的。</p>
<p>因此，照常情看來，窮人們實在是愚且賤。</p>
<p>然而，寗可在三十被多受一點慣受的苦辛以博一年中僅有的數天的幸福的窮人們的心情，並不是不可想像的，誰都追求幸福，［孰窮達而異心，］但誰能都跟有錢的人們那様，舒舒齊齊地安排呢？</p>
<p>不過，有錢的人總是聰明的，他們發明一個方法，就是到了正月初一早晨，仍然去討債，但點着燈籠，算是三十夜還未曾過去，這是不犯例的。但在窮人們可是大觸霉頭。</p>
<p>以上所說的是過陰曆年的事，而且也許只限於我的故鄕。自從改用國曆以後，我的故鄕以及别的地方的窮人們又在怎様過年，我可不知道了。</p>
<h3>［現代中國文學史］一瞥</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>最近買了錢基博做的［現代中國文學史。］不過錢先生題在這部書上的［現代］，含義和我們不同，因之他所說的現代中國文學也和我們不同了。開卷一看，就看到他的緒論。他在緒論的末了說··不題民國，而曰現代，何也？曰，維我民國，肇造日淺，而一時所推文學家者，皆早嶄然露頭角於讓清之末年·，甚者遺老自居，不願奉民國之正朔，寗可以民國槪之！而别張一軍，翹然特起於民國紀元之後，獨章士釗之邏輯文字，胡適之白話文學耳！然則生今之世，言文學而必限於民國，斯文厪矣！</p>
<p>原來他題現代二字，是爲［不願奉民國之朔］的遺老遺少們而設的，他所要說的文學正是這批人物的文學。他在書中凡稱滿清都稱［讓清］，這當然也是用的自孔子以來史家所用的春秋筆法。至於他標句讀，喜用感歎號，這當然也是歐陽公作新五代史喜用［嗚呼］之意。他站在這様的立塲，用這様的觀點，來看現代中國文學，自然只看見遺老遺少的文學，不免發出［生今之世］，言文學而必限於民國，斯文厪矣］的歎聲。</p>
<p>再把這部書的目次一看，緒論和編首，解釋文學，文學史，現代中國文學史·，泛論中匣歷代文學之變遷，一共佔了四十頁。從上編古文學，到下編所謂新文學之［新民體］［邏輯文］，又佔了四百二十四頁。要說到白話文了，從四百二十五頁到四百四十九頁，不過二十九頁。我想倘苦他不寫到這一點關於白話文的文章，豈不恰恰可以題做現代中國的舊文學史，或古文學史？而且已經有四白二十四頁，也够豐富了呀！再不然，率性連下編也不寫，梁啓超的新民體，章士釗的邏輯文，一槪不許闌入書名題做［現代中國遣老文學史］更爲恰當些。雖然其中列有章太炎，那也無妨，因爲章老先生挽黎元洪一聯，已經自署［中華民國遺民章炳麟］呀。倘若爲了這部書的體例純正無疵起見，最好只寫上編，連章老先生也一脚踢開，題爲［讓清遺老文學史］，，豈不大妙？老夫不敏，倒想以這芻蕘之言貢獻給作者錢先生，未知錢先生以爲何如？</p>
<p>錢先生所見的現代中匣白話文學，作家只有胡適之一人，附論的只有周樹人徐志摩兩人，提到姓名的只有郭沬若郁達夫蔣光赤三人。</p>
<p>我在買了錢著現代中國文學史一瞥之後，忍不住要說幾句。將來翻讀一過之後，或許再有下文罷。</p>
<h3>略談［藝術］與［藝術家］</h3>
<p>— 唐雋</p>
<p>有一種人，憑着他們的［直觀］，用色彩，線條，聲調或姿態等的組合作工具，不斷地，盡量地表現他們的［自我］，開展他們的［生命］。這種色彩，線條，聲調，或姿態等的組合愈諧和，他們條，［自我］便愈顯得鮮明·，他們的［生命］便愈開展而有意義。他們的生命開展得越是有意義丨越是有力，那些開展的［痕跡］，也便越形深刻。人們對於這些［痕跡］的感受，也便越發容易。這般痕跡丨繪畫，雕刻······等，人們給他們一個特殊的名稱，呌做［藝術］。作這種［生命之開展］，自我之表露］的，人便呌他做［藝術家］。</p>
<p>所謂［藝術］與［藝術家］，在易的一方面來說，我們曾在歐西見過聽過不少這類名稱·，眞是平常得像家常便飯一様。一個［歌者］，一個［戲子］，人們都呼他［藝術家］。他們所歌唱的，所表演的［曲子］和［劇本］，人們都稱他做［藝術品］。共他關於繪畫，雕刻，裝飾美術等的作品，也一様的被稱爲［藝術］，創作這類作品的人，也一様被呼爲［藝術家］。一般西歐人對於這種名稱，並不曾有一種較其他的名稱有什麽異様的觀念。在中國却不然了。一般［長頭髮］，［大領結］的人們，似乎非如此不足以表出他是一個［藝術家］。他們對於［藝術家’三字銜頭獲得的希圖，比什麽還重要。聽着人們呼他做［藝術家］，比什麽還光榮。這些，都是［美意識］不健全的民族，藝術落後的國家底一種［病態］的表徵。</p>
<p>在難的方面來說·，一件没有［生命］，没有［自我］存在，和表現得没有力量的作品，雖在名稱上被呼爲［藝術］，而在［内容］上却没有藝術的價値。一個生命極庸常，或用着色彩，線條，等等在生命道上極庸常的渡過的人，雖然大其領結，長其頭髮，有藝術家的［形態］，却無藝術家的［實質］。</p>
<p>固然，坐汽車，住大洋房，納外，室，當軍官丨後面時常跟着幾個帶手槍的弁兵，這些，一在般人的意識裏，似乎總覺得是一種極有意義的生命·，而在［藝術家］的眼底下，却不値得一顧。在另一方面，那荒島的蠻人生活·，與野人居，同鹿豖遊·，却鑄成了戈敢（Gauguin）的偉大的［藝術生活］，却鑄成了戈敢的偉大的［藝術］，却鑄成了戈敢這様的一個偉大的［藝術家］！</p>
<h3>客窗小記</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>十九</p>
<p>［有正味　尺牘三卷，清詩人吳錫麒作，内收尺牘有二百二十　，在量上已可謂不少，特讀之殊令人失望。蓋除上卷早年所作者外，全都是些應酬文章，交際尺牘也。早年書牘，在量上不多，但富有眞實性，使讀者能以看到他的生活思想，以及他的環境。在給间寳谷的信裏，他說［吾輩極苦惱人］，早年生活，確是如此。錫麒答徐鐵崖書云··［西風漸寒，弟一切棉衣，皆在質庘，尙希餘潤，一甦困難。］與若愚弟云，［前逋未了，後債又來，正不知何日得跳出此煩惱世界。］寄楊錦堂云··［僕之况味，　日在酸苦中煎熬··欲望回甘，竟不可得。家中人口漸次增多，屋字幾乎塞破。令姊光景，亦日形衰　，而仰事俯育，朝朝總須作無米之炊。］窮窘狀况，在這幾封信裏，最足見之。而此一段生活，也最使他不能忘，所以，在晚年手扎也還有這様的一段憶語··［内而長安不易居，外而八口嗷嗷，熱鍋兒頂上頭來，正不知作何料理。］（寄趙菜臣）</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（七）（五）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>羅蘭媽媽問道··</p>
<p>［筆爾没有下來嗎？］</p>
<p>她的丈夫聳聳肩回答··</p>
<p>［没有，讓他去罷，他老是來得遲的。我們可以先吃。</p>
<p>她轉身向哲安說··</p>
<p>［你應該去喊喊他，我的孩子·，我們不等他時，他要生氣的。］</p>
<p>［好的，媽媽，我去。］</p>
<p>於是靑年跑出去了。</p>
<p>他走上樓，帶着一個膽怯的人去和人相打時的奮激的决心。</p>
<p>當他撞着門時，筆爾回答道··</p>
<p>［請進來。］</p>
<p>他進去了。</p>
<p>另一個伏在桌上寫着字。</p>
<p>［早安，］哲安說。</p>
<p>筆爾立起身··</p>
<p>［早安。］</p>
<p>於是他們互相握了握手像不曾有過一點什麽事情似的。</p>
<p>［你不下去吃早餐嗎？］</p>
<p>［可是······因爲······我有很多事要做。</p>
<p>哥哥的聲音戰慄着，他那不安的眼睛彷彿在探問他得怎麽辦。</p>
<p>［大家在等着你呢。］</p>
<p>［啊！我······我們的母親是不是在底下呢？</p>
<p>［在底下，並且還是她要我來喚你的。］</p>
<p>［啊！那麽······我下去。］</p>
<p>在飯廳的門外，他猶疑了一下，不想先進去·，隨後他以個突如其來了的手勢把門開了，於是他瞧見他的父親和母親面對面地隔了飯桌坐着。</p>
<p>他把眼睛望着地面，一聲不響地走到她面前，像他近來一様，不抱吻她的雙頰，而祇彎着腰把自己的額角送給她吻。他猜到她的嘴巴近來了，但他一點也没有覺到她的嘴唇曾和他的皮膚接觸，他便伸直身子，在做了這番假裝的愛撫之後，他心裏怦怦地跳着。</p>
<p>他心想··［昨晚我走了之後，他們說了些什麽呢？］</p>
<p>哲安時時柔和地喊着［母親］，［親愛的母親］，注意着她，何候她，倒東西給她喝。於是筆爾懂得他們曾經一塊哭泣過，可是他不能深入他們的思想！究竟哲安以爲他母親有罪呢，還是覺得他的哥哥卑劣？</p>

<p>論言</p>
<h3>怎様利用業餘的時間？</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>隨着經濟恐慌的發展，一般職業部門的工作時間都日益增加起來，所謂業餘時間實在是非常少的。正因爲這時間很少，所以就特别寳貴·，而對於這様寳貴時間的處理，也就成爲非常重要的問題了。</p>
<p>一般說來，所有在業的人們，每天都是埋頭於艱苦的，呆板的，乾枯的工作中，的榷没有什麽樂趣。所以他們在工作完畢之後，便要盡量的去追求娛樂，尤其是低級的娛樂，把一點非常寳貴的時間都耗費在打麻將，玩遊藝塲，聽書，看戲······等等低級的娛樂裏。</p>
<p>然而，這些低級的娛樂，都是最能消費金錢，損傷精神的，都是最能使人日益墮落的。把一點寳貴的業餘時間耗費在這様的娛樂裏，的確是太可惜了！　　自然，我們終日疲勞，在工畢之後應該找尋一點快樂，以調劑這疲勞　乾枯的生活。但是找尋快樂，不一定要沈醉或受麻醉於低級的娛樂裏，這對於自己的精神，對於自己的前途和一切，都是絶對有害的。我們在工餘的時間中，應該去找尋那些較爲高尙的娛樂，卽對於自己底身體和精神没有傷害，不致濫費金錢，且能增長自己知識的娛樂。在這原則下，我希望各種職業的人好好地健全各自的俱樂部，好好地健全各人的家庭生活·，同時，更盼望一般社會的先進，注意一般娛樂的問題，努力提倡比較高尙的娛樂，而指導一般在業人員生活的我們［業餘周刋］在這一問題下尤其應該担負特别重大的責任。這様，不僅對於工人，店員，敎師，······所有工作着的人們有莫大的利益，而且對於整個社會都有很大的益處。</p>
<p>不過，我以爲在業餘的時間中，最好是讀書，看報。這是可以增長我們的知識，對於社會，對於個人底職業都有莫大的關係。在此，我認爲上期本刋小傑君所提倡的［業餘通信讀書會］有非常重大的意義，以後若有機會，我還打算對此發表一點具體的意見。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>環境與人</h3>
<p>— 阿二</p>
<p>練習生</p>
<p>咱們兩個子是坐在一隻寫字檯上，面對着面的。但咱們完全是兩個人，兩個什麽都不同的人··性情，意識，工作成績······都各様。咱們是從兩個環境裏生長出來的。五顔六色的環境創造出五顔六色的人。</p>
<p>本來什麽都不一様的兩個人是很不容易長時期的獃在一塊兒的，咱們就一定也免不了這様，假使没有咱們一道做着的工作把咱們連了起來。無論如何，那只不過是咱們表面上的合作。</p>
<p>咱們兩口兒都是會計課的練習生，幹着會計課裏初步的工作··收傅票，理傅票，釘傅票。我比他先進來幾個月，我知道多點，。我將我曉得的統統告訴了他，他却是很隨便的。</p>
<p>家裏邊有錢，對於什麽事情全可以馬虎的·，這是少爺們的一般意見。他是個少爺，所以他也贊成這個。他跑進跑出總是坐着自己的雪亮的包車的，這呌賺二三百元一月要在上海養活一家九個人的，而且還得綳面子的蹩脚主任看着眼睛癢。他吃中飯時嫌行裏的飯菜不好（那是二元一桌的，我覺得這已很了不得了！），每天另外加一元錢。他的頭髮一星期燙一次，BIGWAVE哪丨一次就得化十毛小洋。可是他一個月只有二十隻老洋，（這個他倒並不在乎，而且他曾經有一回向我表示過··他寗願不拿薪水弄個乾辦事員做做！）每個月付他的車夫的工錢還不够呢！此外，他時常看電影的，不論戲院大小，倘若有什麽［藝術］的影片或［人體美］跳舞，他凖到的，不管那個戲院距離他的家裏有多遠。</p>
<p>在有錢的爸爸們看起來，這様一個兒子算不了什麽壞。他服從了他的爸爸在他十八歲的時候討了一個他爸爸替他選擇的老婆，今年又養了一個女孩子。（現在他才二十一歲呀！）而且他否定一些有錢人的三大主義，人不賭，不嫖，不抽大烟·，單是看看電影是不會把山様的財産化完的。</p>
<p>像他這様的人，上海可正多着呢！我跟他恰巧相反。我的年紀比他少二年。我有熱烈的向上的心。環境使我的形式中年化了。我明白我應該工作，我的工作成績至少得跟我獲得的報酬（十五元）平衡。我以爲我們一定要做二十世紀的先鋒隊，不可以過分的享樂跟奢侈。實在的，我常常連購買一件日用必需品的慾望都不能滿足。但我不希求，我老想着還有好多可憐的人被我们踏在脚底下呢！（這就是我對于行裏的茶房跟老司務們特别表示同情的緣故。）他們開始他們的勞苦生活的訓練，在我們有特權進天堂丨學堂裏唸書去的當兒。這喝然是舊社會制度不行，但我們也不能逃避一部分的責任。</p>
<p>因爲這位少爺對於工作不感到一點興趣而且這件工作又不是他獨個子做的，所以我老是笑着對他說··［蜜斯脫周，忽爲什麽不在家裏休息休息呢，跑到這裏來幹這種撈什子？］</p>
<p>［　！這種工作眞討厭！］</p>
<p>他說這種工作討厭，但有誰知道他對於無論什麽工作都是抱着這個態度的呢？老實說一句··我就從來没有看見他對一種工作發生興趣過。我想他一定預備這様過下去，一直到墳墓。</p>
<p>可是，正有好多有力量的失業的人們在哭喊着呀！</p>
<p>每人出銅元一枚</p>
<h3>兩人消費合作</h3>
<p>— 袁翕孚</p>
<p>三房客</p>
<p>上海的生活程度多麽高，我一個人住不起房子，只得與Ｘ大學裏的黃君合住在一家人家的後樓上。</p>
<p>寒風在馬睡上發出呼呼的怒吼，路燈發出慘澹而昏黃的火光，身上覺得有點冷，在一家［起碼貨］的小飯店裏吃了晚飯，要想回到自己的房裏，看一回書。樓梯上没有電燈，走上去的時候，黑得舌頭伸出來摸不着嘴。　　經過了很多的時間，摸到了深夜發</p>
<p>自我職業介紹回音</p>
<p>珍女士··除小學敎師外，願就何種職業？（姚主敎路二○四號徐春波啓）</p>
<p>盧一蘋女士··請先來函（中英文各一）</p>
<p>接洽。（福煦路模範村三十四號許孝騏啓）</p>
<p>出光明而伴我的煤油燈，但不知爲什麽，括去七八根火柴還没有點上火，借着火柴上短期間的火光，照着油到還有半盞。［油是有的，爲什麽不亮呢？］我自己猜度着··［或者是燈繩的緣故吧。］我的腦子裏又浮起一個問題的解答來。</p>
<p>我巳决定去買一條燈繩換上去，可是摸到袋裏的銅板，祇有一個。一個恐怖之神，好像立在我的黑暗的面前，向着我笑。［今夜怎麽辦？房東已出去了，黃君還没回來，睡吧·自己又不願意把良好時光丢去。］這種懷疑的問題，像電流般的在腦子裏走動。</p>
<p>樓梯上的脚步聲打破室中的沉寂，知道黃已回來了。</p>
<p>［火還没有上嗎？］他在半樓梯第一句就這様問。</p>
<p>［一根燈繩壞了，没有錢去買，要等你回來呢！］</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>［三個銅板都没有的？我袋裏祗有一個銅板。］他慢慢地說。</p>
<p>［我袋裏也祗有一個。］我把一個銅板授給他。</p>
<p>兩個人沉默了一會。黃拿着兩個銅板，摸索着下樓梯去了·，我默默地坐在自己床上，好像禮拜堂裏的禱告都，希望上帝赦罪似的仰求着。</p>
<p>大約二十分鐘吧！樓梯的脚上脚又響起來了。［已經買到了。］這是黃的聲音。我聽到［買到］兩字，同小孩子得到一種生平從没見過的玩物一様的快活得跳起來。</p>
<p>重新又靠着火柴的短期的燈光，把新繩換上，黑暗的小屋子裏纔重又光明起來。</p>
<p>時事研究</p>
<h3>一九三三年國際舞臺的壓臺戲</h3>
<p>— 荻來</p>
<p>成爲一九三三年末當前的最嚴重問題之一的是國聯存在與否的問題，這一問題形成了擁護國聯與改組國聯二陣營，前者的代表是英法及其衛星，後者的代表是意德及其同路者。它成爲了歐洲外交鬭爭的中心。倫敦，巴黎，羅馬，柏林，熱烘烘的在捲起了巨大的浪潮。</p>
<p>國際聯盟是一個美麗的名詞。中國人對它作何感想，只要我們回憶回憶九一八後，國聯對東三省問題的處置，大概再用不着費辭罷！它成立於一九一九年二月，在巴黎分贓會議以後，是一個由英法爲領導，並參加了意日等帝國主義，用以宰割弱小民族殖民地及鎭壓革命的機關。但是，它的頭門所懸的却是一塊［保障國際和平及保護勞工］的招牌。</p>
<p>十餘年來，它自然盡了它許多歷史的任務，但它却一件也没有緩和過帝國主義間的矛盾。這個政治的托拉斯隨着世界帝國主義間經濟的及政治的力的對比而改變而趨於動搖，而達到衰老。到九一八後，它的無力對於和平的破壞者加以實力的制裁，早就在大衆面前赤裸裸的曝露了自己的無能和欺騙，它已宣告破産了。</p>
<p>在今年世界全面的陷入更深刻的經濟恐慌與政治的危機中，資本主義的矛盾，帝國主義的對立，到了要用戰爭來解决的時候了。舊的組織有要求解體之必要。自然，從這分解中必然要顯出一幕擁護與打倒的喜劇。</p>
<p>促成國聯的解體，先由於日本退出國際，國聯對此，毫無辦法·，現在德國法西斯蒂想取得軍事冒險的自由，也退出了國聯，國聯也同様的無法應付，只得縮小了自己的範圍。這是證明國聯已完全破滅，一切基於日内瓦機關的活動，在大衆眼前，完全消失其幻想了。</p>
<p>現在躍出的新勢力是法西斯蒂意大利，積極的要求改組國聯，德國自然是抱同一主張。意德之反對凡爾賽的體系是有根由的。德國是所謂被害的國家，意國在此中並未取得領導的地位。意國現在要求歐洲的領導了。德國却不得不借外交上的冒險政策，來加强對國内的尊嚴。反對凡爾賽條約，要求軍縮的平等，却是最動聽的要求，以此相要挾而退出國聯和軍縮會議是易於驅除大衆的不滿，洗淡緊張的情緒，而轉移大衆的視綫的。這是法西斯外交的基點。</p>
<p>意德自然是這一陣營的領導者。他們要粉碎這一組織，改變歐洲勢力的分割，他們在等候戰爭。</p>
<p>在英法這面，自然也非眞的愛護和平。它不過對這種旣成的支配勢力不肯輕於讓人罷了。現在他們出來維護國聯，不過是延長大家備戰的時間，不見得會有補於［世界和平］。</p>
<p>試觀法國巴黎之冠蓋往來，縱橫勾結，積極聯絡衛星，加强自己的力量，以及倫敦那般狂熱的討論國聯與軍縮問題，加入討論的有政治家，軍事家，牧師，其景象活像一九一四年大戰將要開始之時，我們就可以想到，他們並不畏懼戰爭，他們也是同一的在凖備戰爭，不過，欲利用這國聯的幌子，更好在大衆面前招搖，更利於自己凖備戰爭（雖然這戰爭是大衆所積極反對的），取得戰時更優越的地位，以制勝敵人罷了。</p>
<h3>怠工</h3>
<p>— 春生</p>
<p>雉妓</p>
<p>十月的天氣，雖然在溫帶上的東方大都會，那風吹在身上也够勁的了。深夜裏，風吹得更緊，摧落了馬路兩旁樹上的枯葉，吹捲起立在馬路兩旁神女的旗袍，刺進了一切貧苦人們的心裏。這是大自然的一把利刀呀！</p>
<p>深藍的天海中有數不清的星星　眉弄眼，像也是諷刺和嘲笑這大都會矛盾似的。馬路當中汽車屁股釘屁股一輛一輛不斷地奔馳，車廂裏安閑地坐着大肚皮的男人和小巧的女人，向大戲院，夜總會，跳舞塲，尋求他們的刺激。三大公司以及大世界底下有一班人在活動着，她們像不知道到了晚上是該休息似的，面上搽了一層厚厚的粉，兩腮和嘴唇抹上紅色胭脂，身上散着劣等看水的氣味，有額上疊滿皺紋的老太婆，也有還未發育完全的少女，她們密密地緊緊地擠在馬路兩旁，伸出手去想攫去一兩個工人學生鄕下佬，用肉體去換得生活資料。許是因爲風緊和身上衣裳單薄的緣故，她們上下牙齒互相打動着，身體瑟縮着，兩隻腿鬼一般的抖着。</p>
<p>桂，她這種生活還幹得不久，經受了刀一般的風的威逼和皮鞭一様的鴇母眼光的鞭撻，她痛苦得要流下淚來，溫暖的回憶又慢慢地爬上她心頭。</p>
<p>丨丨也是這麽清幽的銀夜，風的勁兒並不比今天差，可是不覺得冷。媽媽在灰黃的燈光下縫衣裳，我和姊姊弟弟在天井中捉迷藏，·········</p>
<p>在她面前，巍峨的建築物和閃爍的年紅燈以及大都市的噪音消失了。灰黃的燈光，媽媽慈祥的臉，弟弟的頑皮，狹狹的碎石鋪成的天井······這一切可愛的回憶，像一點點的浪花在她腦海中跳躍，溫暖了她的心，她墜入沉思中了。</p>
<p>［猪　！儂阿要吃生活？人打從儂面前跑過去看弗見！］</p>

<p>立珍知道爹又受了氣回來，便到籬笆後面的房裏去拿水焑袋。不凑巧，水烟一層都没有啦，仍空着手跑出來。</p>

<h3>兒童君子與兒童明星</h3>
<p>— 喻細伢</p>
<p>山西汾陽通訊</p>
<p>讀者諸君··在農村組織動搖，經濟頻於崩潰的非常狀態下，且讓我來告訴你們一些關於鄕村兒童敎育的情形。</p>
<p>鄕下孩子有兩處唸書丨受敎育的所在，一處是村子裏的私塾，一處就是鎭上的所謂［洋學堂］了。我眞不懂，鄕民到現在還把敎科書呌作［洋書］，把縣立的學校呌作［洋學堂］，而那班負鄕村敎育之責的先生們，亦那麽糊裏糊塗，將錯就錯的讓他們去呌得洋洋盈耳。讀者諸君··你們想吧，此咎其誰負之？</p>
<p>然而，這些也不必多費唇舌了，現在且把這兩個兒童敎育機關的實體說上一說。私塾大多設在陰氣森森的宗祠裏，由村子上有孩子的人家拼凑出一二十塊錢，邀個前清老秀才把一夥天眞爛漫的孩子關進去，伴陪着老師吃那無期徒刑般的官司，你想那夥像野馬様的孩子怎受得住這無形的桎梏。師案上那根一尺長，寸半　，二分厚的茅竹戒尺，就够嚇得他們小心兒卜卜地跳啦。</p>
<p>往往一個很活躍的孩子，祇消進了私塾，就變得呆木木的了。那位老秀才只本着［吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人］的道理，整天價鐵扳着臉去敎訓孩子，他那裏去管孩子們的天性與神經是受不了這突然間的壓制和約束的啊。</p>
<p>還有一椿笑話，三叔公家的小孩子，今年九歲，已能把一本三字經背得爛熟，可是我另在紙上寫一個［性本善］的［善］字給他認，他就膛目不能答，可見私塾裏讀書，只是硬記。孩子們怕老師戒尺的威嚴，也只有硬記纔２得免掉挨吃手心。這種過嚴的私塾敎育，實在不適合於幼稚的鄕村兒童。</p>
<p>然而，要說到學校了，學校又什麽様呢。</p>
<p>鄕鎭上的學校，也許你們見過的吧。那種因陃就簡的組織，那種素位尸餐的敎員（眞肯負責的不多見），那種放任的敎育，並不見得比私塾樂觀哩。前天午後，深澤弟弟的約我上鎭去玩，順便到ＸＸ縣立初級小學校看一回，可眞滑稽透了，敎員正吹着哨子在敎孩子們唱［孟姜子尋夫］哩。聽說他們上一天課，除掉半天在塲上（天井）外，還有半天就是什麽歌舞不歌舞了。</p>
<p>讀者諸君，你們别以爲我言之過甚。大姨母家的貞弟亦在那裏讀書，讀了兩個年頭，還剛讀完一本啓蒙敎科書，而歌舞的成績倒確是非常可觀了。</p>
<p>這種放任敎育，對於鄕村兒童究竟有些什麽好處呢？</p>
<p>我的意見，以爲鄕村的兒童敎育，太嚴厲固然不宜，太放任亦屬非是，最好能［寬猛相濟］。同時，不能常常把都市裏種種繁華和享樂介紹給他們。應該隨時隨地說出農民在社會上所佔據的地位，農村的所以會糟到如此地步的原因。但，這些話不能扮着［老師］的面孔去說，要婉轉些纔行。</p>
<p>然而在國家政治未上軌道，而一方面又忙於［安内攘外］的現象下，鄕村裏的小學敎員領不到薪俸，鄕村裏的兒童受不到良好的敎育，是普遍的必然的趨勢囉！</p>

<h3>什麽是最有用的學問？</h3>
<p>— 宋令儀女士</p>
<p>［學以致用］，這雖是中國底一句古諺，但直到現在都還没有失去其絶對的正確性。一般學醫學工業的人，自然是爲了［用］的·，研究政治，法律，哲學，文學者，也是與這［用］字分不開的。瓦特之發明蒸汽機，在其發明時，是否爲了要［用］，這可不管，但牠終於是被近代的所謂［文明社會］［用］了。基督敎［博愛］的敎義，就表面看來，似乎是很公平的，然而這却是被帝國主義［利用］了。總之，無論什麽學問，無論你學什麽，總是不能離開這［用］字的。［學以致用］，確是千眞萬確的眞理。</p>
<p>然而，在目前的中國所表現出來的。不是［學而無用］。便是［所學非所用］。一般有學問，有才能的人，没有［用］的機會·，學科學，學工業的人去作政治委員，學醫，學農業的人去作公司賬房或稅收機關的職員··這些都是目前中國社會普遍的現象。因此，有些敏感的人，便以爲［學以致用］這句話不對，以爲要學得眞正的學問，便應與這無用的［用］字脫離關係。於是［爲學問而學問］，［爲讀書而讀書］的理論便被提倡起來了。</p>
<p>其實，在目前出現的所謂［學而無用］與［所學非所用］這現象，是畸形的中國社會的産物。學科學的人而没有用其科學才能的機會，是證明着畸形的中國社會是拒絶科學的。這並不是［學以致用］這理論的不對，而是中國社會有問題。爲了要解决中國社會的問題，更需要能够解决這問題的學問。如果不管這個，而去提倡［爲學問而學問］，［爲讀書而讀書］，那便只有使這畸形的中國社會延長，由這社會所産生的［學而無用］與［所學非所用］的現象也就會要更加普遍地發展了·，至於什麽［眞正的］學問，也當然不能産生，因爲學問是社會的，不是超社會的，畸形的目前中國社會，絶不能容受［眞正的］學問，牠所容受的，只是不健全的卑下的學問而已。</p>
<p>所以，在目前情形之下，我們所要學的，不僅是那有［用］的學問，而且是那最有［用］的學問，這便是那能够解决畸形中國社會所産生的一切問題的學問。</p>
<p>怎様的學問才能解决目前中國社會所發生的問題呢？我在此没有具體的意見。我只說··要解决中國社會的一切問題，便非了解中國實際的經濟政治的一切情形不可。所以要求最有用的學問者，便必須去參加一切社會運動，了解一切社會情形。所謂［閉門讀書］［休談國事］的辦法，實在是愚民政策的具體表現。只要不是甘爲這一政策所播弄者，便必然會把理論與實際聯緊起來，針對着目前中國社會的實際情形，努力去求那最有用的學問。</p>

<h3>長期試用</h3>
<p>— 冠英</p>
<p>寫字間</p>
<p>總算託天之福，我終於靠着自己的毛錐，在失業萬千的人潮中，尋覓到一個位置，一直到現在，巳服務三四個月，而且還是公司寫字間的事呢！　　提起了寫字間，也分有很多的等級，有的是巍峨的洋房，有的只租了一個房間。裏面的職員，有的月拿幾百兩是極平常的事·，有的頂多只拿十多塊錢的薪水，連一個看門的都不如。我所服務的寫字間。是在某處二層樓上一個角落裏，古老的洋房，距離現在至少在半世紀以上。扶梯上下的處所，白畫亦如黑夜，連一盞路燈都没有·，上來下去的時候，一不留心，便有傾跌的危險。兩間光綫不充的内室，便是我們工作的地點。不過，地方雖小，作用却大，只要在進門時數一數牆上的招牌至少有一二十個，什麽ＸＸ會，ＸＸ社，ＸＸ館，便會使你攪不清楚究竟是什麽機關。</p>
<p>記得是夏去秋來的時候，我正在謀求職業，陡的接到一封自薦的回音，囑我去面洽一切。</p>
<p>那時我是如何的歡喜，我懷着那如獲侄寳的一封信，到了ＸＸ公司丨現在服務的公司丨去謁見經理先生。經過他一番面試之後，承他認爲滿意，敎我在那裏先試辦文牘事務。試用期爲三個月，每月津貼車馬費十元，期滿合用後，月薪從二十五元起支，試用期並可縮短。我當時雖嫌薪水過於微少，决不够最低限度生活上的開支·，但因爲以後的希望尙佳，就很安心地做下去。初進去的時候，的確是僅做的文牘事務，每天大小信件至少要寫上幾十封，幸而我對於文字尙稍有訓練，倒也也能措置裕。後來不知道從那裏曉得我對於賬務也懂得一點，就慢慢把大部分帪簿分配給我管。我以爲在試用的時期，不妨略顯顯身手，遂也樂於盡力。但，這様一來，可就不得了！從早到晚，除去吃飯時能有片刻閒暇外，其餘都是埋首案頭，手不停揮的工作着。</p>
<p>一月，兩月，······光陰像馬跑的一般快，這様繁重的工作，巳把我磨折得疲敝不堪。我的一綫光明，就繫在那試用期滿後的正式任用！加薪問題。這是我唯一的希望和慰安，在朋友的談話中，在寄回的書信内，我都公開的表示過。他們都欣羨和期待着我那前途的光明和生活的安定，我也自信我試用期内的成績並不錯，這一點目的總可達到。</p>
<p>第三個月終了時，他對我一聲也没響，我當然是仍舊做下去，心内以爲不辭退就是合用，旣然正式任用，最低限度的薪水丨二十五元丨當然是拿穩了。我快樂，我興奮，怱怱一月又過去。一天，正下了寫字間，經理先生招呼我去，我知道是領薪水的時候了，一顆心在跳躍着。一見面，他先說了一大篇生意是如何清淡的話，末了補上一句［我只能照這數目發給你。］說着手裏便遞過兩張五元的鈔票，外加上兩枚雪白的袁頭。我聽到這番話，看見這個數目，週身好像中電一般，麻木了。我待要說什麽，他已站起身來聽電話去了。我的天哪！說什麽？說了有什麽用？除非你不幹。不幹，在這不景氣的年頭，賤價拍賣的人正多着呢。</p>
<p>我拿着十二元的薪水，走出公司的大門。都市的火炬，從黑暗中襯出光明。寒夜的冷風，撲面如割，含着無限的威脅。希望的夢已打得粉碎了。</p>

<h3>自尊心和職業</h3>
<p>— 行健</p>
<p>這裏有兩個職位··一個是報上常常登着招請所謂半盡義務的敎員，每月津貼車馬費八元，膳宿自備·，一個是茶房，每月薪水十五元，供給膳宿。我想，除了目不識丁，只好去當茶房者外，凡是喝過幾年墨汁，有資格當敎員的，一定選擇第一個職位。錢，是人人祇會嫌少不會嫌多的，尤其是那些多有一個銅板就可以多用一個銅板來解决不能再薄的生活的失業者們（自然也有一部份例外，不過我想大多數總是如此）。但他們爲什麽偏偏要選擇那薪金低少，待遇不佳的第一個位置呢？一言以蔽之，就是［自尊心］在那裏作怪。這裏有兩個例子··</p>
<p>我有個在中學裏畢了業的朋友，因爲經濟問題無力再求上進，祇好在家裏等候跑進社會的機會。他的學問雖還不差，可是第一乏人薦引，第二肚子裏裝的都是歷史地理幾何三角，可說没有一點商業經騐。一年，兩年，轉瞬間滑過了，他仍是依然故我，坐在家裏做寄生蟲。有一次，他因不堪生活壓逼，剛巧有一位親戚說要介紹他到某商店門市部去當練習生，他老着面皮（他自己這様說的）去當了三日跑回來對我說他不幹了。他憤然說··［······除了每天早晨七點鐘起到夜裏十點鐘止，全日裏忙得幾乎道吃飯大便也没有工夫的肉體勞苦不算外，還要看一般高級職員的晚爺面孔。以我堂堂（？）一個中學畢業生來當這個撈什子，外加還要受鳥氣，我寗願勒緊褲帶餓死也不幹······。］我當時聽了，除嘆了口愛莫能助的氣外，我覺得他的自尊心在作崇。</p>
<p>另外還有一個中學未畢業的朋友，也因經濟壓迫想投身社會，但和他一様學識同處一様境地的人，社會上眞個隨時可撈起幾把，他雖賣盡了氣力，花了不少來路不易的郵資，轉瞬間三年已過，還搶不到一個破缺飯碗。他有個朋友認識二個包銷英文大晚報的頭目，據那頭目說，他將報批給呌賣的每份大洋八分，呌賣的可以大洋一角的代價出售，每份可賺大洋二分，賣不完也可退回。如每天能銷四十份（那是最普通的銷路），卽有大洋八角進賬。還有一般西人常常給小洋二角，不要找頭，那就间［外快］。所以每天進，賬一塊幾角錢是件極尋常的事。他的朋友想介紹他去試賣試賣看，他以不想坍他父親的臺推辭了。但無論如何，他推辭的動機的成份，我想多少總有點自尊心攙雜在内吧。</p>
<p>整千整萬的失業者伸着手向社會討麵包，很多很多的失業者因經濟壓迫而自殺，雖然其中大部份是社會不景氣所賜與，但我敢武斷說一句，其中不少責任是自尊心所應該擔負的。</p>
<p>最後，我們大聲疾呼··</p>
<p>［以勞力換飯吃和用智識換飯吃是一様的，並不算坍臺，更不是恥辱。</p>
<p>打倒虛無縹渺有害無益的自尊心！］</p>

<h3>改良中式簿記的我見</h3>
<p>— 鞠符</p>
<p>改良中式簿記，宣傳甚力·，我在學校裏學習的是會計簿記等功課，現在的職務又是司帳，對於這一件事當然注意，現在我且將此項研究所得，簡略的寫在下面。</p>
<p>第一是金額欄數目宇的分行問題。查複式簿記的金額欄，都明白分出萬千百十元角分等各行，且於千百二行間界以深藍線，元角二行間界以紅線，以示醒目。今查改良中式簿記的金額欄，並不明白分行，和不改良的相同·，如此則一萬元和一百元同爲三字，五元和五分同爲二字，如此混同，怎能一目瞭然？實不符記帳以明瞭爲要之旨！倘能依照複式簿記而印線分行，則一萬元連同小數二位共佔位七格，一百元連同小數二位共佔位五格，這五格是統在深藍線以後的，五元連小數二位共佔位三格，五分則共佔位一格，這一格是在紅線以後的。像上面記法，數目有長短的差次，前後的分别，當然能一目瞭然，知其大小，不會有什麽混誤了。金額是帳簿上最重要的部份，旣稱改良，此點誠不可忽視。</p>
<p>第二是橫式與豎式問題。豎式須用直幅，直幅不宜過長，無敷設多欄金額的便利。橫式則能採用多欄式記帳法。多欄式記帳法的便利甚大，具備分化與集合的效能。因爲多欄式記帳法是彙集諸戶於一帳的，全部記錄，都在眼底，記帳查帳，都可不必東翻西查，能免去不少麻煩，節省不少時間，减費不少腦力，而且集諸戶於一帳，簿籍當然少用·，若用豎式，就適得其反了！所以，這點實有討論價値，决不可以爲幾千年傳下來的制度，便是至寳無上的國粹！</p>
<p>第三是記帳用何種數目字問題。大家知道，阿拉伯數字已爲世界各國所公用，卽在我國，自大學敎授以至男女工友，莫不識之，現在門牌汽車以及其他號頭，亦都應用，可見阿拉伯數字在中國已經十分普遍。而且全國學校，自初級小學起卽令兒童學習阿拉伯數字，將來阿拉伯數字在中國，無疑地要同世界各國一様，到處採用牠。所以，我認爲記帳應採用阿拉伯數字。阿拉伯數字宜於橫寫，益見橫式簿記的宜採用。其實我國人對於數目字可說是習於橫看的，因爲千百年來商界所應用的刻不離手的算盤所表示的數目，恰同阿拉伯數字同様排列，完全是橫行的。</p>
<p>有人說··［照你主張，那末用毛筆寫呢？用鋼筆寫呢？用外貨紙張呢？用國貨紙張呢？］在皮我可附帶的說幾句··帳簿是十分重要的，法律上明文規定須保存十年，可見紙張必須用堅牢不易破碎的。試看收付欵轉帳憑單，第一步手續就得經過製單員，會計，核准者，三人輾轉授受，再拿來登記各項帳目，又須經過幾次傳遞，倘若紙張軟薄，會不破碎嗎？有人說··［那末國貨是不行的了？］我以爲國貨當然要推行，有錢自己賺，還有異議嗎？但一味墨守陳法，不知改良與模倣和創造，實在不是一個積極的辦法！吾人豈可因火車無國貨而長途步行？削足就履，因噎廢食，終非久計！全國學校所用鋼筆洋紙等物，恐不在少數吧？倘能自製，挽回利權，當非淺鮮！</p>
<p>末了，我對於［改良中式簿記槪說］一書裏有幾句話。牠說［中式簿記······記帳人員，取材甚易，非若西式簿記······人材難得，處處須增加經費也。］（見該書第二頁）又說［改良中式簿記，······人材用品，皆可以較廉之代價得之。······］（見該書第四頁）而牠自己却又說［改良中式簿記乃運用最新學理之簿記法也。］（見該書第五頁）該書作者在［改良中式簿記之四時期］一文中也說他的改良中式簿記［以視西洋複式簿記，原則上無不可貫通者，］又說［未嘗背於複式簿記之原理原則，］（見十二月十五日申報經濟專刋）可見改良中式簿記和西洋複式簿記的原理是相同的。那末，要明白帳理，不論改良中式簿記或西洋複式簿記。無疑地同様要研究通曉了原理才行。旣然如此，就得請問··爲何中式簿記員取材甚易，而西式簿記員便人材難得？這話是不是專用以說明中式簿記員的代價應該較廉，而西式簿記員的代價太貴，要弄到處處增加經費的？這話實有促起資方對勞方减低薪工的企圖！這企圖也許能取媚於資方，但我們朝夕勞苦的人們，是非提出嚴重抗議不可的！</p>

<h3>Fuzhou Commerce Falls into Stagnation</h3>
<p>It is heard that Fuzhou's commerce has completely ceased. If merchants and the government leaders cannot agree on a solution regarding the issue of billeting troops in civilian houses soon, the merchants plan to request the Fujian government to transfer all the troops in the city to the countryside as an initial step to resume commerce.

<p>Guangxi Purchases Ten New Aircraft, Arriving in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Sun Ke visited Hu Hanmin again on the morning of the 30th to discuss the current situation and went to Macau at noon. He will return to his hometown and stay for a day or two before returning to Hong Kong. It is heard that Sun, having met with Hu and Lin Yizhong to exchange views, plans to go directly back to Nanjing from Hong Kong instead of going to the province. (Special dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong: Guangxi's ten newly purchased aircraft have arrived in Hong Kong, and Lin Weicheng is scheduled to lead them to Guangxi on the 31st. (Special dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Official circles here claim that Sun Ke will come to the province after the New Year. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: According to Zhang Ji, the central government's opinions on the Southwest's contributions are currently under consideration. Hu has not indicated any intention to come to Nanjing while in Hong Kong. In fact, whether in Hong Kong or Nanjing, both are serving the country and there is no difference. For example, although Central Committee members scattered in various places are not working in Nanjing, their service to local areas is also a form of effort and can be taken as an example. Sun Ke has arrived in Hong Kong aboard the President Hoover after accompanying his wife to the Philippines to recuperate. He has met with Hu again. At the same time, Sun will make a trip to Guangzhou from Hong Kong in the shortest possible time to meet with Central Committee members staying in Guangdong, such as Chen, Xiao, and Lin, to exchange opinions in a private capacity in order to return to Nanjing before the 5th of next month for the central government's reference. The central government has made a thorough resolution regarding the Fujian issue. The Central government plans to quickly pacify the rebellious Chen and Li factions who oppose the country by using its military force against the Fujian army. We believe that besides farmers, workers and merchants that are still diligently doing their jobs, most people who enter officialdom cannot fulfill their duties, which has led to the country's affairs being as chaotic as tangled hemp. It is hoped that everyone will follow the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and use psychological reconstruction to save China, quickly quell internal strife, and unite against external enemies.

<p>Beiping: A unit of Liu Guitang's troops, numbering over a thousand men, passed through Xiangtun, Yaoziyu, and Liugoucheng from Yanqing on the morning of the 30th, fleeing to Erdaoguan in Changping County, Hebei Province. On the evening of the 29th, Liu's troops attacked Yanqing County Seat. The Public Security Team inside the city went out to meet the enemy and engaged in battle for an hour before retreating back into the city. They are currently still in a stalemate.

<p>Not a Single Aircraft from Public Donations Has Been Used</p>
<p>An Official from the Aviation Department Claims</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the rumor that planes donated by the public had also been used to bomb the Fujian province, an official from the Aviation Department said that no planes donated by the public have been used in bombing operations. Besides, planes purchased through public donation were mostly Hawk planes, which can only fly up to 600 miles, which is suitable for chasing but not suitable for long flights. They are currently stored at the Hangzhou airfield. Nine aircraft donated by the public such as those named Shanghai Merchant, Boy Scout, Shanghai Industry, Ningbo, Huangpu, etc., have been received. Nine more, such as the Hangzhou School, Hangzhou Government, Peiping-Hankou and Aviation Comrade, etc. are due to be received shortly. Xu Peigen originally planned to fly those planes to Nanjing on January 15th to form two volunteer squadrons, permanently stationed in the capital. However, because the Fujian Incident is taking place, Xu and others are preoccupied with directing the air force at the front line. Therefore, they have no time for this. It should be possible to actually form the volunteer squadrons around February or March of next year. (Special dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian is reviewing the Mongolian autonomy measures. An official of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said that there is no doubt about the principles of Mongolian autonomy. However, there are two points that still need to be considered: First, according to the central government's observation of the joint office of the Mongolian autonomous regional government, it is still appropriate to contact the emotions and opinions of the Mongolian autonomous regions, but a small number of Mongolian princes have not yet understood this and hold some objections. It may be decided after the Central government's detailed explanation. Second, how should the tax revenue in the counties and banners where Han and Mongols live together be distributed to avoid disputes between the two parties? The Central government believes that this point must be carefully planned in advance, including the past records of local tax revenue in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, the contents of the tax payment ratio of the Han and Mongolian nationalities, and the opinions of the provincial governments of Chahar and Suiyuan and the princes of the Mongolian Leagues and Banners, before a decision can be made.

<p>(Beiping) The two special commissioner's offices of Luan-Yu-Ji-Mi have been separately negotiating on the issue of taking over the passes of the Great Wall in recent days. Substantial progress has been made. Although the Japanese army has not made any earnest expressions on the Shanhaiguan side, they have given their initial consent to the handover. Because the handover procedures have not been consistent between the two parties, the delays have been difficult to resolve. After Iwai and Tao Shangming held their final talks in Tianjin a few days ago, they sent a telegram to the Kwantung Army for instructions. Once they receive a reply, Iwai will notify our side to start the process. The future is certainly not a problem, but one should not be too optimistic. Secondly, on Gubeikou and other locations, the Japanese side also sent personnel to sincerely negotiate with us. It is heard that a preliminary takeover could be done. Key locations such as Malanyu, Yiyuankou, and Xifengkou would have to wait until the takeover of Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou has been completed. Furthermore, the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that when the barracks outside the pass are completed and the troops stationed at the passes are withdrawn, they will be completely returned. At that time, if no other changes occur, it should proceed smoothly. In addition, Yin Rugeng, the special commissioner of the Ji-Mi District, went to Gubeikou a few days ago to inspect and negotiate the takeover of the affairs of the pass. The results were quite satisfactory. Yin returned to Tongxian on the morning of the 30th and will come to Peiping at 6:00 PM to pay respects and report to Huang Fu.

<h3>Russian Communist Party Political Department Passes Industrial Expansion Program</h3>
<p>Occupies the Majority of the Second Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Focusing on the Consumption of Cotton Textiles and Food</p>
<p>To be Implemented Upon Approval by the National Congress</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Communist Party's official newspaper, "Izvestia," reported that the Communist Party's Political Department has passed a major expansion program, encompassing almost all industries, scheduled to be completed in 1937. This program constitutes a large portion of the Second Five-Year Plan, with a particular emphasis on the consumption of produced textiles, goods, and food to ensure the plan's success. It will be implemented after being approved by the Communist Party Congress next month. Detailed information about the Second Five-Year Plan is also expected to be released next month. Although the plan began on New Year's Day of this year, the first year primarily involves broad estimations with fewer detailed procedures. Furthermore, as Soviet Russia is currently rushing to construct its defenses with millions of rubles, particularly emphasizing national defense on the Manchurian border, efforts to achieve the targets set at the end of the First Five-Year Plan have inevitably been diminished. It is estimated that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1937, the nation's total production will be worth 1,030 billion rubles, a significant difference compared to the mere 430 billion rubles in 1932. Additionally, the set goals include tripling the consumption of fish, meat, butter, eggs, and sugar compared to 1932, and increasing the number of workers nationwide by 30%, with a substantial increase in their wages. There are also grand plans for the construction of new factories during the Second Five-Year Plan, including 15 textile mills, 12 cotton mills, 11 silk mills, 21 shoe factories, 17 meat factories, 6 soap factories, and 23 food factories. Moreover, 5,000 kilometers of electrified railways will be built, and 9,500 kilometers of new railways will be constructed. The massive canal between the Volga and Don rivers, as well as the large hydroelectric plant on the Volga River, will also be completed before 1937. It is estimated that these construction projects alone will require 5 million workers, and related trade will require 43,000 experts to handle. In terms of education, a seven-year compulsory education program has been planned, and agriculture will be completely collectivized. However, the retail prices of daily necessities will be reduced by 35% to compensate for the sacrifices made by the proletariat. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>
<p>Romanian Prime Minister Duca Assassinated in Political Assassination</p>
<p>Shot Three Times, Bullet Piercing Head</p>
<p>One Member of Parliament Injured Simultaneously</p>
<p>Assassin Belongs to Right-Wing Faction, Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Rome: Romanian Prime Minister Duca was assassinated today at the Sinaia train station after being received by the Romanian King. The assassin drew a pistol and fired three shots at the Prime Minister from close range, with bullets piercing the Prime Minister's head, resulting in immediate death. The assassin, a student named Constantine Nicolescu, was arrested on the spot. It is widely believed that he is a member of the so-called "Iron Guard," a recently disbanded anti-Semitic group. There were three accomplices, but only Constantine fired at the time. To ensure the success of the assassination, a bomb was also thrown. A member of the Romanian Parliament named Constantine Nicolescu, who was traveling with the Prime Minister, was also injured. The position of Prime Minister is currently being temporarily filled by the Minister of Education, Angelescu. Duca was appointed to form a cabinet on November 14 of this year. He was traveling to Sinaia on state affairs because the Romanian King is currently residing there. The Romanian King expressed deep sorrow upon hearing the news of the Prime Minister's assassination, and the entire nation mourns his loss. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Details of the Incident Rome: Prime Minister Duca was assassinated and died from his injuries. Additional details of the incident are provided below. As Prime Minister Duca was returning to the capital by car from Sinaia, Constantine Nicolescu suddenly threw a firecracker at him as he was about to board the train. Simultaneously, he fired five shots, three of which hit Duca, two in the back and one in the leg, causing profuse bleeding. He immediately fell to the ground. A detective at the scene was injured in the hand but managed to apprehend the assassin and protect him from being violently attacked by the public. Another passenger at the station was also hit by a bullet. The assassin carried six bullets in total, with only one remaining after the attack. This individual, aged 26, graduated from the Bucharest Academy of Commerce and belongs to the right-wing Iron Guard, which has national socialist tendencies. He intended to run in the recent parliamentary elections but was unsuccessful because the Iron Guard was dissolved by the government. He confessed that Prime Minister Duca belonged to the Freemasons, and the policies he implemented were those advocated by the international Freemasons, which was extremely dangerous, hence the decision to assassinate Duca. (Agence Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Motive for the Assassination Rome: Constantine Nicolescu, the 26-year-old assassin of Romanian Prime Minister Duca, is a student at the Bucharest Commercial College. Two accomplices were involved: one named Calimati, a coffee shop owner, and another named Drubenimachi. The assassin, Constantine, was recently nominated as a candidate by the fascist, pro-German Iron Guard in the recent election. Today, he confessed that he assassinated Duca because Duca was a member of the Masonic order and not a loyal patriot. The cabinet has now decided to arrest members of the Iron Guard and adopt stringent measures to maintain order. Duca was well aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the Iron Guard movement and its foreign support, so he recently dissolved this group to protect the nation and prevent harm to Jews and other ethnic groups. After taking office, Duca used his dictatorial-like powers to destroy emerging nationalist movements, such as the National Socialist Party's stormtrooper-like groups. Duca's assassination shows that the accumulated incompatibility between the old political parties led by Duca's liberals and the young fascist party with revolutionary goals has reached its peak. Duca's remains have now been moved to the Royal Palace for a state funeral. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Mass Arrests Rome: Following the assassination of Prime Minister Duca, many people have been arrested across the country. Over a hundred people have been arrested in the capital on suspicion. Rumors suggest that the government will declare martial law, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Successor Prime Minister</p>
<p>Dr. Angelescu has been appointed as the new Prime Minister. He recently delivered a speech at the State Council, highly praising the late Prime Minister Duca. Duca's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday, and his remains will arrive in the capital tonight and will be displayed at the Literary Hall for public viewing. (Agence Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Impact on the Political Situation</p>
<p>(London) People here express indignation and concern upon hearing about the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Duca, viewing the assassination as a planned step by the Fascist Party to seize power. The Liberal Party's official newspaper, "Manchester Guardian," stated that the assassination is feared to trigger political unrest and lead to the emergence of a dictatorship. (Agence Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Brother-in-Law Expresses Grievance</p>
<p>Rome: Poliuto, the brother-in-law of the late Romanian Prime Minister, expressed his grief and anger over Duca's assassination. Tonight, he entered the Sinaia police station with a gun and fired shots near the assassin Constantine Nicolescu, but missed. Furthermore, when the train carrying Duca's remains was about to leave the Sinaia station for Rome, a bomb exploded at the station. Duca ruled the country with an iron fist after taking office, and the Iron Guard to which the assassin belonged was the group Duca ordered to be banned recently. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>

<p>National Alert Declared</p>
<p>Former President Arrested in Connection with the Unrest</p>
<p>Buenos Aires: The Argentine government, due to the simultaneous disturbances that occurred last night in Rosario, Santa Fe, and other places, resulting in nine deaths and fifteen injuries, declared a state of alert today, which is effectively martial law. Although the government claims that the disturbances have been completely quelled, it expects to maintain the alert for several days because of unreported incidents in coastal provinces, necessitating increased vigilance. It is reported that last night, rebel parties attacked police stations in Rosario and Santa Fe with rifles, pistols, and grenades. The police opened fire to resist, arresting dozens of people, and the rebel parties dispersed. However, there are also reports of conflicts, deaths, and injuries elsewhere. To suppress the rebellion, the government has ordered a nationwide arrest of rebel parties. The arrests are particularly stringent in the capital, Buenos Aires, and the largest commercial port, Rosario. Former President de Alvear, as the leader of the Radical Civic Union, was also arrested here. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires: In the capital of Argentina and elsewhere in Argentina, a conspiracy to actively oppose the current government was discovered and swiftly suppressed. However, there was some bloodshed in Rosario, Santa Fe Province. Today, the police in Buenos Aires discovered the rebellion plot and arrested several leaders, preventing the rebel party from realizing its plan to seize government agencies. Troops in the capital gathered in the camps, preparing for incidents. In Rosario, a mob threw bombs at the police station, attempting to seize the police station and armory. Mounted police charged and dispersed them, arresting eighty-eight people. Twenty people died and many were injured in the conflict. There was also a riot in the city of Santa Fe Province, and the police station was attacked but quickly dispersed by the police. This disturbance seems to have been based in Santa Fe Province.

<p>Roosevelt's Peace Speech</p>
<p>A Shot in the Arm for European Politics</p>
<p>Supporting the League of Nations, Opposing Military Expansion</p>
<p>Echoing French Policy</p>
<p>(Paris) The speech given yesterday by U.S. President Roosevelt has been enthusiastically received by the French, who widely believe that the United States is gradually broadening its interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, as evident in Roosevelt's speech yesterday. On one hand, Roosevelt is supporting the League of Nations, and on the other hand, he is opposing the expansion of armaments and formally endorsing a permanent international system for monitoring armaments. This demonstrates that the United States is echoing France on various major international issues. Yesterday's meeting between U.S. Ambassador to Russia Bullitt and French Undersecretary of State Tedeschi further increases the satisfaction of French public opinion, as Bullitt is a close friend of President Roosevelt. French public opinion also believes that Roosevelt's speech will have a significant impact worldwide, especially in Berlin, at a time when Germany is demanding rearmament. As for London's wavering attitude and Rome's obvious opposition to the League of Nations, it is believed that Roosevelt's words will also have an impact on these two capitals. Journalist Blanc wrote in "Le Journal": "Roosevelt's speech is like a shot in the arm. How can we not express our admiration for Roosevelt? At a time when the United States is facing many domestic challenges and those bearing national responsibilities face numerous difficulties, Roosevelt is still able to make such an important statement on the international stage, which is truly admirable. Moreover, the failure of former Democratic President Wilson was precisely due to the Senate's opposition to his foreign policy. Roosevelt dared to challenge the Senate on the anniversary of Wilson's death, demonstrating exceptional courage." (Agence Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Supplement to Roosevelt's Speech</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt delivered a speech yesterday at the Board of Directors of the "Wilson Foundation," as reported by this agency yesterday. Additional details of the unmentioned content of the previous dispatch are provided below. President Roosevelt reiterated his previous proposals on disarmament and renouncing aggression.</p>
<p>Support for the Monitoring System (1) All countries should gradually abandon offensive weapons within a certain number of years and no longer manufacture them but have the right to strengthen their border defenses for permanence and stability and have the right to permanently monitor the armaments of neighboring countries internationally.</p>
<p>No Use of Force Abroad (2) No country's force should exceed its own borders; otherwise, it will be considered an aggressor. Conclusion of Disarmament Agreements (3) Formal agreements must be concluded to eliminate aggression and offensive weapons.</p>
<p>National Tendency Towards Peace Roosevelt said that after recent events, we are moving further away from the ultimate goals of ourselves and former President Wilson. Roosevelt said, "Those with shallow views will say that the failure of disarmament is due to the development of nationalism. Believing this, it is necessary that the people everywhere agree with nationalism. However, judging from the current national trends in various countries, this is not entirely the case. The danger to peace lies not in the people but in certain political leaders."</p>
<p>Special Class of People Revered Roosevelt continued, "Among the 1.5 billion people in the world, I dare to say that at least 90% are satisfied with the current territories, and if other countries reduce armaments, these nations would be happy to reduce their forces. The danger to world peace arises from the psychology of fear or the remaining 10% of the people may not be in disagreement. The worry is that their leaders want to invade other countries' lands to expand their own territories. These leaders use various reasons to oppose disarmament, even hindering other nations who have agreed to disarmament and non-aggression principles. If nine-tenths of the world's people can make the remaining one-tenth advocate their own ideas without being manipulated by their leaders, then a permanent and effective peace can be established worldwide." (Agence Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Satisfaction in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) People here are very satisfied with the speech delivered yesterday by U.S. President Roosevelt, particularly emphasizing the following words: "The League of Nations encourages countries to sign non-aggression treaties and form disarmament agreements, which can be regarded as the cornerstone of world peace. The United States is not a member of the League of Nations and has no intention of joining, but in the event of non-purely political issues and other issues that clearly represent the views and interests of all nations in the world rather than the special class purposes of certain political leaders and not the purposes of imperialism, the United States is willing to cooperate with the League of Nations." (Agence Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Various Newspaper Opinions</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers all have minor criticisms of the speech delivered by President Roosevelt on the birthday of former President Wilson. "Le Temps" expressed sympathy for the declining ability of the League of Nations but criticized the United States for refusing to join international organizations with strength, saying that the failure of the disarmament conference was mostly due to the inactivity of the United States. The United States' refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles or form a strong Anglo-American front to resist Germany's aggression is an obstacle to the world peace organization. "Le Matin," while expressing satisfaction with President Roosevelt's remarks, concluded that the United States should not ignore France's past experiences and dare not readily accept its words. France will judge the foreign policy of the United States based on its actual actions rather than its pleasant words. (National Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>All newspapers in Rome and Italy welcomed President Roosevelt's speech. "Il Giornale d'Italia" said that the main points in his speech completely coincided with the views of Italian leader Mussolini, especially on the two issues of revising treaties and disarmament. (National Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt delivered his speech yesterday at the Board of Directors of the "Wilson Foundation," the initial response in the United States was extremely favorable. Only "World Telegram" expressed slight dissatisfaction, saying that the President's speech "failed to make a clearer reference to the gathering war clouds in Europe and the Far East, which contain serious dangers, which is a pity." Fortunately, the Monroe Doctrine, sometimes used by the United States as a unilateral tool to send troops to the republics of the New World, was not explicitly criticized in Roosevelt's speech, but such an interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine has been written off. The newspaper also said that the United States can remain untainted with Latin America, and then it can have the latitude to speak righteously against the imperialism of Britain, France, Italy, the German arrogance of Hitler, and those who profit from war.

<p>U.S. Rushing to Build New-Style Fighters</p>
<p>(Washington) General King stated today that the U.S. Navy is building a new-style fighter for testing. The aircraft is equipped with super twin engines and is expected to become one of the world's fastest military aircraft. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>
<p>France Deliberates Carefully on Reply to Germany</p>
<p>Ponceau to Visit Berlin Today</p>
<p>(Paris) It has been confirmed that French Ambassador to Germany Ponseau will return to Berlin on Sunday to attend President Hindenburg's New Year's reception. It is expected that the French memorandum to Germany will not be submitted before January 5 or 6. It is reported that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently consulting with Ponseau on the wording, hoping that the text will not be too sharp and will leave room for Germany to respond. The French government clearly wants to see if there is a possibility of a compromise between France and Germany on the disarmament issue before the Disarmament Conference's Main Committee reconvenes on January 21 next year. (National Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>London Does Not Plan to Send a Note to Germany</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the report that the British government plans to send a note to Germany on the disarmament issue, a semi-official announcement was issued here today, stating that it is completely unfounded. (National Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>Hymans Completes Business and Leaves France to Return to Belgium</p>
<p>(Paris) Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans came to Paris to discuss official business with French authorities. He met with President Lebrun yesterday and is scheduled to return to Brussels at 11:25 tomorrow morning. (Agence Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>The Achievements of the League of Nations Are Thus</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations has recently compiled and published a booklet on the various activities of the League of Nations this year. According to the report, 1933 was the most burdensome and criticized period for the League of Nations since its establishment. During this year, there were two important international conferences: (1) the Disarmament Conference and (2) the World Economic and Monetary Conference. There were also three important political disputes: (1) the Sino-Japanese conflict in the Far East, (2) the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia over the Gran Chaco, and (3) the dispute between Peru and Colombia over the Leticia port. The Disarmament Conference made significant progress on the system for monitoring armaments, but it encountered serious difficulties after Germany withdrew. As for the World Economic and Monetary Conference, it adjourned without achieving its main objectives but made considerable achievements on the wheat and silver issues. In addition, there are other achievements, namely (1) the convention on limiting the manufacture of narcotics and suppressing their sale, which was concluded in 1931, has been implemented and has come into effect, and (2) the League of Nations Covenant has been ratified by Argentina, and the country has rejoined the League. This is the tangible result of the League of Nations this year. (Agence Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Paraguay and Bolivia Extend Truce</p>
<p>Paraguay Only Permits a Maximum of Eight Days</p>
<p>As for the Gran Chaco war, the League of Nations investigation team proposed to Bolivia and Paraguay to extend the truce deadline from midnight on December 30 to January 14 next year. Bolivia has formally accepted, while the Paraguayan government only allows an extension of eight days. (Agence Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Japanese Political Situation in Chaos During Parliamentary Recess</p>
<p>Military and Political Parties Secretly Contend</p>
<p>Fascist Faction Fights with Zaibatsu</p>
<p>Communist Activities in Tokyo Under Strict Alert</p>
<p>Cars Equipped with Wireless Radios Patrol Day and Night</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government is optimistic about the upcoming Diet session. It is said that the trend of the Diet depends on the Seiyukai, and there is a faction within the Seiyukai that advocates dissolving political parties. Although its leader, Matsuoka Yosuke, has withdrawn from the Seiyukai, Nakajima and others remain in the party and oppose the movement for cooperation between political parties. There is also the Kuhara faction advocating a one-party dictatorship, which does not cooperate sincerely with the Suzuki faction. Even Tokonami and Kuhara do not accept positions within the Diet. Therefore, the Suzuki faction will not sever ties with the government in the Diet. Although there is no cause for concern in the Lower House, the various factions in the Upper House are very dissatisfied with the militarist dictatorship movement of Army Minister Araki and may use a certain disrespectful incident involving the military to severely criticize Army Minister Araki and investigate the responsibility of Justice Minister Oyama. The security of this case is even more important than the May 15 assassination of the Prime Minister. If the Upper House raises this case, not only will Araki and Oyama suffer, causing the cabinet to collapse, but also the country will be in great turmoil. During this holiday, Chief Secretary Horikiri has been actively lobbying various dignitaries to prevent this case from being raised, but whether he will succeed is difficult to predict. It is heard that the military's opinion is that in order to quickly reorganize the military, the 65th Diet session must pass smoothly and the military budget must be determined before settling accounts with the zaibatsu and the feudal forces in the Upper House. Before the budget is established, they will endure and appease the opposition. However, various fascist groups will use farmers to carry out riots during the Diet session. This Diet session will definitely be held in an unprecedented dangerous environment. (China United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese political situation is extremely chaotic, with the military and political parties contending, the fascist faction fighting with the zaibatsu, the police pursuing the communists, and young military officers conspiring. At this time of the year-end, thieves are rampant on the streets, causing rumors to spread and people to panic. The Metropolitan Police Department, as a precaution, has decided to set up a wireless radio station on the roof of the department in early January next year, with the call sign JIBH. It will also install sending and receiving equipment on four patrol cars, using short waves to communicate with the Metropolitan Police Department. Furthermore, starting from mid-December, a special police unit will be organized to specially guard the capital. A patrol car equipped with a wireless telephone will also be specially prepared to closely guard against any eventuality. (China United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Saito Discusses New Policy</p>
<p>Fostering Pseudo-Organizations for Development</p>
<p>Striving for Coordination with Various Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito went to his villa in Ichinomiya, Chiba Prefecture, yesterday to spend the New Year. He is scheduled to return to Tokyo on the 3rd. The Prime Minister said in the car that the government has many things to implement next year, among which making "Manchukuo" a solid country is the most important mission. Many people are discussing the crisis in 1936. I believe that the government's most important task is to cooperate with the powers in accordance with the Emperor's edict. If it does not cooperate with the powers, Japan cannot be recognized for its existence. Therefore, at the Second Washington Conference, Japan must maintain cooperative relations with various countries within the scope of not endangering its national defense foundation. (Japan United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Puppet Ambassador to Japan to be Replaced</p>
<p>(Changchun) Ding Shiyuan, the "Manchukuo" ambassador to Japan, has submitted his resignation due to illness. It has been decided to replace him. Ding Jianxiu, the Minister of Communications, and Shen Ruilin, the director of the North Manchuria Railway, are the most promising candidates for the replacement. (Electric News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>The Origin of the Crown Prince's Title</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily yesterday, the Crown Prince held his naming ceremony on the 29th, named Akihito, and titled Tsugu-no-miya. According to a conversation with Tomi-no-miya in the Imperial Household Agency, the origin of the title of the Crown Prince is based on the edict issued on January 3, Meiji 3, and based on the I Ching. The title Tsugu-no-miya is based on Han Yu's "Pacification of Huaixi Stele" ["Holy Son, Sacred, Inheriting Successively"]. Also, the Doctrine of the Mean has ["Good in continuing his will,"], and the History of the Han Dynasty has ["Emperor who Inherited the Body"], so Tsugu-no-miya is the title of the Crown Prince.</p>
<p>U.S. Purchases Gold from Civilians</p>
<p>Another Step in Suppressing the Gold Standard</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Acting Treasury Secretary Morganthau stated today that the Treasury Department's order for civilians to immediately hand in gold coins is solely for strictly enforcing the ban on hoarding gold and cracking down on the wealthy who resist and hoard gold, and it is not related to the government's gold purchase plan. The penalties for those who violate the order have not yet been firmly decided. However, it is generally believed here that the Treasury Department's move is a preparation for establishing a free gold market in the future and reducing the gold standard. It is indeed another step in the plan to suppress the gold standard. (National Telegraph, 29th)</p>

<p>Liu Guitang's Troops Flee from Chicheng to Yangyuan</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Increase in Eastern Chahar</p>
<p>Zhang Renjie's Troops Fill Defense in Chicheng</p>
<p>Liu's Mother Instructs Her Son Not to Defect</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The Japanese troops who invaded Eastern Chahar have shown no preparation to withdraw. Recently, they have established a bandit suppression headquarters in the Heihe area, indicating a desire to occupy it for a long time. Although some of the puppet troops in the 24th district of Guyuan have withdrawn to Dolon, the Japanese troops in the Xifengkou area have slightly increased. After Liu Guitang's troops left Chicheng, the Chahar provincial authorities have transferred the troops of Zhang Yunrong and Zhang Renjie to advance, and Zhang Yunrong's troops have entered Chicheng to maintain order and handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Liu Guitang, nicknamed "Black Seven," is from Caozhou, Shantung. He is 53 years old and extremely fierce. He was originally a major bandit in Western Shantung, repeatedly surrendering and rebelling. To date, he has rebelled more than fifty-one times. Last year, he fled from Shantung and entered Jehol. After Jehol fell, Liu falsely surrendered to the rebel army and defrauded the Japanese army of a large number of weapons and ammunition. This spring, he entered Dolon from Jehol. When Feng Yuxiang organized the Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Zhangjiakou, Liu telegraphed to support the righteous cause. When Song Zheyuan returned to Chahar, Liu's troops were reorganized accordingly and stationed in Chicheng. Song repeatedly telegraphed, inviting him to Zhangjiakou for a meeting, but Liu never responded. This time, when the Japanese and puppet troops invaded Eastern Chahar, the Chahar provincial authorities, in order to consolidate the defenses of Eastern Chahar, dispatched Zhang Yunrong and Zhang Renjie's troops to reinforce the defenses. On the other hand, due to Liu's unclear attitude, they ordered him to move to Yangyuan in Western Chahar. They telegraphed Liu repeatedly, but Liu did not reply. Liu suspected that the Chahar provincial authorities had ulterior motives and was quite uneasy. He convened a meeting of his subordinates, intending to flee eastward and join the puppet rebels. At that time, Liu's mother was still in the army. Upon hearing the news, she strongly disagreed and instructed her son, saying that although she was over seventy years old, she would rather be a bandit in China than a traitor. Although Liu was crude, he was filial to his mother, so he stopped the plan to flee eastward and sent his mother to Tianjin. On the 25th, he led his troops to leave Chicheng and fled southwestward. Liu's troops totaled eight to nine thousand people. At the time of the rebellion, Xia Ziming's brigade, which was stationed in Longsuo, did not defect and remained in its original defense, expressing obedience to the orders of the Chahar provincial authorities. Zhang Junjie and Liu's representative, Tian Gangyi, were also in Xia's place. Liu only led five to six thousand people to flee westward, first to Yangtianbao, south of Chicheng, attempting to flee into the war zone for cover. Yesterday (27th), they fled to the Dishuiya and Hongshaling areas and were besieged by local militias and Japanese puppet troops, splitting into two groups. One group fled back to Yangtianbao, and the other group fled towards Qingkou. Today (28th), Liu himself has led his troops to Yongningzhen, west of the railway, with only two to three thousand remaining troops, in a very miserable state, and there is a tendency to flee in separate directions to the Yangyuan area. After receiving the alert of Liu's troops' rebellion, the Chahar provincial authorities, in addition to ordering Zhang Yunrong and Zhang Renjie's troops to quickly enter Chicheng to maintain order, also ordered the troops of Feng Zhan</p>
<p>The following was sold at the Wan Chun New Tobacco Shop in separate strips</p>
<p>The third phase of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was publicly drawn at the Yiyuan Garden at 10:00 AM on the 29th of this month. The details were recorded in this newspaper. It was rumored that the winner of the first prize, number 313817, was sold by the Xin Gong He Xiang Tobacco Shop on the Rue du Consulat in the French Concession. However, after investigation by reporters, it was learned that the lottery ticket was first allocated to Dafulai by the Dayun Company, and then transferred to the Wan Chun New Tobacco Shop at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road for sale in separate strips. A Chinese constable of the Haining Road Huishi Patrol Room won one strip, an Indian constable managing the traffic lights at the intersection of Haining Road won one strip, five apprentices in a certain tobacco shop at the intersection of Route Khan and the Boundary Road jointly won one strip, and a judicial police chief of the Special First District Court won one strip. Other winners could not be ascertained because no records were kept. The five apprentices of a certain tobacco shop on Route Khan were overjoyed after learning that they had won the first prize, and they lit incense and candles yesterday to pay tribute to the God of Wealth. It is both gratifying and amusing.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications Orders the China Merchants Bureau to Stop Hiring Foreign Seamen</p>
<p>Foreign seamen whose contracts have expired should not be rehired.</p>
<p>Vacancies should be filled by promoting Chinese staff.</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Communications, in order to safeguard the shipping industry, has recently issued an order to the China Merchants Bureau to stop hiring foreign captains and seamen, and that when the contracts of current captains and seamen expire, they should not be renewed. Instead, Chinese seamen should be promoted according to their qualifications. The original text is recorded as follows: “According to the China Merchant Ship Drivers Association, at the beginning of the China Merchants Bureau's establishment, most of the crew members of all levels were foreigners. This was because the Chinese people lacked nautical talent and had no choice but to borrow talent from other countries, resulting in the loss of sovereignty, which is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, in recent years, the Chinese people have worked hard and diligently, and more and more people have acquired nautical knowledge. Chinese people began to serve as crew members of all levels in the bureau. Afterwards, after being managed by the national government, the principle was to have Chinese people serve as crew members of all levels, and vacancies were mainly filled by promotion according to qualifications. As a result, more and more Chinese people served as crew members of the bureau, and many Chinese people were also promoted to captains. We are fortunate that nautical sovereignty is gradually being recovered, which is a glory for the country. Since Chinese people have served as captains, they have been prudent and careful, and their performance has been excellent. In the past, when foreigners served as captains, accidents occurred frequently, such as the sinking of the Xinhua, Xinji, Xinchang, and Xinkang ships, which is clear evidence. Furthermore, according to the laws of various countries, in consideration of sovereignty, the principle is to have their own citizens serve as captains. As for the high salaries paid to foreign captains, it is a minor matter to waste the national treasury. It is now heard that the bureau has the motive of employing foreign captains again, such as recently hiring a foreign captain for the Xinfeng ship. This not only violates the original system, but also fears that nautical sovereignty will be lost again. We are deeply saddened by this. We do not know what Liu, the general manager of the bureau, is thinking, disregarding the country's nautical rights? The association has witnessed this situation and finds it difficult to remain silent. We hereby submit this report to the Ministry, ordering the general manager that foreign captains in office should not be rehired after their contracts expire, and that when there are captain vacancies, Chinese crew members should be promoted according to their qualifications and no foreigners should be hired again, so as to safeguard nautical rights. This would be a great blessing for the country." Therefore, in addition to the approval, this order is hereby issued to the bureau to investigate and submit its opinions for approval. This is the order.</p>
<p>Yongkang and Hongyuan Ships Rescue Hongli</p>
<p>Hengshan Ship Collision Case</p>
<p>Dingsheng Claims 50,000</p>
<p>The grounding of the Sanbei Company's Hongli ship in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been reported in this newspaper. Now, according to telegrams, due to the rapid and shallow Yongji Shoal, rescue is difficult. Therefore, the Yongkang ship has been dispatched to assist. A more detailed description is as follows:</p>
<p>Grounded at Xiache Bay</p>
<p>The grounding of the Hongli ship occurred in the Yangtze River, in the waters of Xiache Bay near Jianli. Due to the sharp drop in the river level, the ship was grounded. Initially, the Shashi Sanbei Branch planned to send the Hongheng ship to tow it, but because the Hongheng ship was larger and the water was very shallow there, the Hongyuan ship was ordered to sail to tow it. However, due to the rapid current and shallow water, it could not be rescued. The owner of the Hongyuan ship telegraphed the Shashi Branch to report.</p>
<p>Send Barges to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from Hongyuan, the Shashi Branch dispatched a batch of laborers and released the No. 8 towing barge to Xiache Bay, ordering the workers to first unload all the cargo inside the Hongli ship, and then tow it, so that the ship's hull would be lighter and easier to tow. However, the barge could not get close, so they telegraphed Shashi again, requesting the dispatch of the shallow-water small ship Yongkang to tow it quickly. The Shanghai Bureau has already telegraphed the Hankou Branch to do so.</p>
<p>Hengshan Collision Claims</p>
<p>The company's Hengshan ship sank the Dingsheng ship in Zhenjiang. Now the shipowner has sent a formal letter of claim to Shanghai, stating that the Dingsheng sank, with a loss of more than 30,000 yuan in ship hull damage, and a loss of more than 10,000 yuan in lost passengers, cargo, crew luggage, and clothing, for a total of more than 50,000 yuan. They are demanding compensation from Sanbei.</p>

<p>Two Railways Reduce Freight Rates for Cotton Yarn and Stone Pencils</p>
<p>Promoting Education and Encouraging Domestic Products</p>
<p>Eight Percent Discount on Piece Goods and Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Effective January 1st of Next Year</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, in order to reduce the freight rates for domestic stone pencils and piece goods and cotton yarn, has decided to implement this starting on January 1st of next year. Yesterday, it specially notified the Traffic Department to comply with the following original text:</p>
<p>Domestic Stone Pencils: It has been found that pencils were originally listed as Second Class (boxed) and Third Class (ordinary) for freight charges. Now, the Ministry of Railways, considering that the stone pencils produced near Changxindian are domestic products and daily necessities for primary schools, has ordered all railways to allow them to be listed as special prices in accordance with the special price method for educational instruments, books, and printed matter formulated by the former Ministry of Communications. The freight rate is set at 2.7 hao per 100 kilograms per kilometer, to be implemented on a trial basis for one year, in order to show the intention of promoting education and encouraging domestic products. The bureau has received the order and now sets the implementation date as January 1st, 1934.</p>
<p>Piece Goods and Cotton Yarn: With regard to the transportation of piece goods and cotton yarn on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, those who report for transportation with a certificate from the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association will be charged at a special price with an additional 20% discount. This was previously approved by the ministry. Now, the merchants believe that the freight rates for these items on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line are different from those on the Beijing-Shanghai Line and request equal treatment. After careful assessment by the bureau, it is believed that there is no need to reduce the freight rates for cotton yarn and the special price for piece goods and cotton yarn on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line. However, the 20% discount based on the certificate from the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association can be applied to ensure fairness. This has been approved by the Ministry of Railways and will be calculated at an 8% discount to promote the industry. This will also be implemented from New Year's Day next year.</p>

<p>Using Radio to Control Trains</p>
<p>Japanese Poisonous Plan to Annihilate Volunteers</p>
<p>The Japanese are very worried about the activity of the volunteer army in the puppet state of Manchuria. Recently, they devised a plan to annihilate them, using radio to operate an empty train to lure the volunteer army to attack. Then, a train full of armed soldiers will follow closely behind at a quarter of a mile, ambushing and attacking them. In this way, even if the volunteer army is injured, they will not know how to fight back.</p>
<p>Cigarettes are Not Allowed to Reduce Taxes</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce Telegram</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in reply, saying, "Cigarettes are luxury consumer goods, and all countries levy heavy taxes on them. The taxes levied in our country are still light. At present, due to the urgent need for funds for bandit suppression and construction, the first-level tax has been increased to 160 yuan and the second-level tax to 80 yuan. The Central Political Conference has resolved to follow this plan. It is inappropriate to approve the request to postpone the implementation or reduce the tax. In this tax increase case, four measures have been stipulated for investigating and cracking down on tax evasion and smuggled cigarettes: (1) Setting up cigarette factories is limited to four places: Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou. No cigarette factories are allowed to be set up in other places, and existing ones should be ordered to relocate within a time limit, and if they fail to do so, the government will recover them at an appraised price. (2) The capital of newly established cigarette factories must be more than 500,000. (3) Handmade cigarettes should be strictly restricted and no further registration should be allowed, or they should be banned immediately. (4) Tax police should strictly investigate and ban counterfeit and tax-evading handmade cigarettes. Tax evasion investigation teams should be set up in places where there are no tax police. The above items have been ordered by the Ministry to be carried out in sequence. According to the report from Yu Tingsheng, chairman of the Cigarette Industry Association, the association has resolved to comply with the newly increased tax rates. Special reply."</p>
<p>Cement Merchants Request Exemption from Increased Unified Tax</p>
<p>Tax Administration's Approval Rejected Yesterday</p>
<p>Matters Concerned Should Not Be Made to Revoke the Order</p>
<p>Bank Guarantee Still Allowed for Bookkeeping</p>
<p>The China Cement Manufacturers Association received a reply from the Tax Administration yesterday, saying, "I have read the report. The increase in cement tax was originally a last resort for the government. At a time when the national treasury is strained, the construction of major projects, and military operations to suppress bandits all require funds, manufacturers should make an effort to help. Moreover, the newly revised cement unified tax rate is the same throughout the country, and all factories bear the same burden. Manufacturers only have the intention of collecting and paying taxes on behalf of consumers, and the actual tax burden is borne by consumers, so manufacturers should not feel too much pain. Moreover, this administration has a bookkeeping method for manufacturers to pay the unified tax. If manufacturers can find a bank guarantee, they can be allowed to keep accounts, so they will not suffer the difficulty of paying the unified tax in advance. Matters related to general cases, the request to revoke the order is difficult to forward. It is hoped that manufacturers will be properly persuaded to work hard to comply. This is what is expected."</p>
<p>Shanghai Second Special District Local Court</p>
<p>Rectifying Court Opening Times and Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association has written to the President of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court regarding the delay in court opening times and the occupation of lawyers' seats by police officers, requesting that the President correct this. The original letter and instruction are recorded below. (1) The Lawyers Association's official letter is regarding the fact that criminal cases do not open on time and police officers occupy lawyers' seats, requesting correction. According to a proposal by member Gao Junxiang, criminal cases in the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court often do not open in accordance with the scheduled time after the scheduled opening time. Defense lawyers sit idly in court due to the delay in opening. If there is another case in another court or in another division of the same court before or after the scheduled time, they will be hindered from performing their duties. Furthermore, it is feared that there will be no shortage of plaintiffs and defendants who lose their jobs due to the delay in the lawsuit. Furthermore, the lawyers' seats in the criminal court are specially for lawyers appearing in court to perform their duties and should not be occupied by anyone. However, recently, these lawyers' seats have often been occupied by police officers, in order to maintain order and the execution of lawyers' duties. It is proposed that the court correct these matters. After deliberation by the Joint Meeting of the First 156th Executive Committee of the Association, it was resolved that the matter should be forwarded to the court for review and correction. This is for the convenience of the public. (2) Instruction from the Second Special District Court, Instruction No. 149 from the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, to the Shanghai Lawyers Association, regarding a letter requesting correction of court opening times and occupation of lawyers' seats. I have read the letter. The requested matters have been separately ordered to be handled. This is the order for your information.</p>

<p>New Strategies for Developing Business on Two Railways</p>
<p>Adding a Business Branch in the South City</p>
<p>Entrusting Travel Agencies as Agents</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway authorities, in order to facilitate travel and develop business, specially established a business office at No. 407 Jing'an Temple Road (west of the intersection of Ma Road) to handle the sale of passenger tickets, the delivery of luggage, parcels, and goods for passengers, the reservation of sleeper cars and hotels, and the handling of group travel and all transportation procedures. Since its opening, it has been very convenient for travelers and has achieved remarkable results. In order to facilitate travel in the South City, a business branch has been added at No. 10, opposite the Ning-Shao Wharf on the Outer Bund of the Sixteenth Steet. It is currently being renovated and decorated and is expected to open on New Year's Day next year. In order to facilitate travel in the interior, the railway has signed a contract with the China Travel Service. Starting from New Year's Day next year, all domestic travel branches and sub-branches will be agents of the two railway business offices, handling the delivery of goods, parcels, and all transportation procedures for passengers, so as to facilitate travel.</p>
<p>New Information on Economic and Credit Cooperatives</p>
<p>Striving for Practicality and Not Just Empty Talk</p>
<p>Striving to Facilitate Members</p>
<p>Since its opening, the China Economic and Credit Cooperative has had hundreds of members. The cooperative is quite capable of fulfilling its mutual assistance responsibilities in the face of members' difficulties. Members who are unemployed can request job referrals. The method is for members to fill out a job referral application form. Except for those who lack ability or have excessive expectations, the cooperative will help them find employment. When they find employment, they can entrust the cooperative to sign the contract. After finding employment, no remuneration is required. However, requests for referrals cannot be answered within a limited time, nor can the job introduced by the cooperative be transferred to others. The cooperative has eight types of cooperative loans. At present, only credit loans and bill discounts are available. Recently, many members have requested loans. Except for those who have no ability to repay, the cooperative does not reject them. However, the amount of the loan is fixed according to regulations, so it is insufficient to allocate, so the amount of loan requested by each person must be slightly reduced so that all members can benefit.</p>
<p>The cooperative has legal and medical consultants to provide free consultation to members. If they are still unclear after consultation, they can ask again. It is said that Xu Xueping has been hired as an accounting consultant, and Zhang Zhirang, Ma Junshuo, Li Caixia, Zhang Diming, Qian Baohe, Sun Zuji, Yin Shijie, and Qiu Hanping, etc. as legal consultants, and Yang Baoheng, Chen Siming, and Song Hongfu, etc. as medical consultants. There are also commercial and study abroad consultants who are being hired.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the cooperative plans to hold an economic cooperation movement week because some people from all walks of life do not fully understand economic cooperation. It plans to publish a special issue and hold lectures. People from all walks of life, such as Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Chu Minyi, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, and Pan Gongzhan, etc., have expressed their sympathy and participated in the sponsorship.</p>
<p>In addition, for those who believe in cooperativeism but are unable to pay the membership savings, they are also given the opportunity to enjoy mutual assistance. Therefore, an amateur inspirational association is attached. Those who join the association are like joining ordinary social organizations, without having to save monthly, and the rights they enjoy are almost the same as those of members, except for life insurance and maturity interest. More than 100 people have joined. At present, in order to promote cooperation, it is planned to solicit members. The association has supplementary schools, current affairs lectures, Sunday entertainment, mutual assistance fund rules, and bonus rules, etc. It is also heard that Ye Yunfeng, Zheng Tianren, Qiu Huasheng, and Wu Yuwen, etc. have been hired from among the members as the association's secretaries, and Xiao Yihan, Qiu Jinxian, and Zhuang Zutong, etc. as reviewers.</p>

<p>Jincheng Grand Theater to Open Soon</p>
<p>Architecture and Equipment Exceed Expectations</p>
<p>The Jincheng Grand Theater at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road was founded with exclusive Chinese capital. The construction has been going on for half a year, and the entire project has been 90% completed. The grandeur of the architecture, the richness of the decoration, and the novelty of the equipment can be called unique. The entire building is three-dimensional and towers into the clouds. There are four huge pillars on the facade, which are magnificent and magnificent, adding to the heroic posture. At night, the light shines thousands of feet, reflecting the Chinese and English characters of the golden neon lights, adding to the beauty. The escalators in the hall are also decorated with neon lights, which shine inside and outside, making it a magnificent sight. The arrangement of the electric lights in the theater is extremely exquisite and delicate, with concealed lighting that is elegant and pleasant. The corridors throughout the theater are decorated with high-quality carpets, which are light, soft, and unparalleled. There are more than 1,800 seats, all with spring cushions and brightly colored seat covers, which are comfortable and luxurious, unprecedented. The style, size, and arrangement of the seats are particularly carefully considered, so as to achieve the goal of no seat being bad. The sound equipment used is a German solid-state giant machine, which has a sturdy sound, lasts for a long time, and produces a clear sound that is neither sharp nor turbid. Even the slightest breath can be heard easily. As for all the noisy echoes, they are all covered by the non-flammable sound-absorbing paper on the walls, and the countless small holes on the screen are sufficient to assist in the perfection of the sound. The projector used by the theater is the German Anaman No. 5, which has long been popular all over the world, but the No. 5 is the latest product released in March last year, which is much more advanced than previous products. The light is also strong, and the objects projected on the screen are all three-dimensional, with clear distances and clear characters. The theater not only planned carefully for sound, light, and seats, but also paid special attention to hygiene management and fire protection equipment, so that the audience can get rid of all worries and feel comfortable both physically and mentally. The heating and cooling equipment is the latest type, and the cooling can be increased or decreased freely, and the temperature can be raised or lowered appropriately according to the climate outside the theater and the standards of hygiene. Being in it is like enjoying the pleasure of a gentle breeze and without the pain of dryness and annoyance, which is especially suitable for the physique of Chinese people. In the future, when it is put into use, everyone will be satisfied. The so-called heating is not the ordinary hot water radiator, but a special equipment that transports hot air into the theater. There is an automatic device that can freely control the hot air and the temperature is moderate, warm and spring-like. Now, the theater will open as soon as the internal layout is completed. It is said that the first major contribution of the opening will be the Lianhua special giant film [Return].</p>

Various methods have now been adopted to actively proceed. The association's chairman Kong Xiangxi, fundraising committee chairman Fei Meide, committee members Wu Tiecheng's wife, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Bei Zuyi, Cao Yunxiang, Luo Yunyan, Du Yuesheng, Chen Liting, Pastor, Zhang Xuelou's wife, Guo Shun's wife, Zhu Ziliang, Fei Wusheng's wife, Miss Smith, Yan En's wife, Chen Bingzhang's wife, Mrs. Lowry, Mrs. Xu Jianping, Mrs. Edward, Miss Kerr, Mrs. and Mrs. Raynal, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, Mrs. Song Ziwen, Miss Tang Luoguan, Mrs. Song Hu, Mrs. Studebaker, etc., as well as secretaries Xu Jianping, Chen Tiesheng, Wang Guanyi, Zhao Jian, Chen Zhengfan, Zhang Yueru, Han Chao, Ding Bingnan, Liu Jinfang, and Wang Aitian, etc., all carry out their work in separate groups, and are very busy in order to achieve their goals and meet the needs. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to All Sectors</p>
<p>Association Chairman Kong Xiangxi wrote a letter to all sectors, saying, "With respect, Xiangxi believes that child welfare is the foundation of the country, and China is an ancient country of child welfare. In recent times, the country has been plagued by many misfortunes, the status of children has declined, and there is no way to revive the nation. If this continues, what will become of the country? Therefore, five years ago, I gathered comrades to establish this association, using my personal abilities to assist the government, which has no time to do so. We have established a protection group to safeguard the rights of children, a relief group to open up ways for children to live, a health group to promote the health of children, and a research group to start the teaching of children. The achievements of the work are obvious to all. In order to promote the cause and enrich the strength of the association, we plan to raise funds for the foundation in the short term, in order to meet the feelings of the Chinese people and to inject them into the annual expenses in the future, so that the prescribed plan can be realized. I have long admired your enthusiasm for patriotism and your concern for child welfare. I dare to beg you to generously donate money and recognize annual donations. The benefits will not only bless the children of the whole country, but also rebuild the Republic of China. I respectfully request this."</p>
<p>Fundraising Notice</p>
<p>The foundation of a country lies first in supporting the nation, promoting civil rights, and solving people's livelihood. The basis of the nation is children, the evolution of civil rights is in children, and the implementation of people's livelihood depends on children. Therefore, to support the nation, we must first love children; to promote civil rights, we must first protect children; to solve people's livelihood, we must first educate children. Love, protection, and education are all rights that children should enjoy, and they are also the missions that the association has undertaken since its establishment. It is found that in the past, all provinces also had infant halls, orphanages, Mengxue elementary schools, kindergartens, etc. for children, which also had the intention of protection and education. However, due to changes in national affairs, the main reason was that they were not here, so old habits, such as the rich accumulating slaves and abusing maids, and the poor drowning children and selling daughters, and unscrupulous people taking the opportunity to make a profit, still persisted. Alas, who has no parents, who is not a child, and to blame, the room is here. This association was established in 1928. Up to now, it has been five years, with division of labor and cooperation, and each is responsible for its own duties. Special protection, inspection and relief, and recently, we have revised children's laws and established juvenile courts to continue to protect them. We have established child welfare education and care homes, and child welfare health and medical clinics, and hired experts to compile children's books and other children's stories and children's songs. We have also established a child welfare park in Yangzuo, specializing in taking in the young children of female workers, and providing them with education and care. We have also proposed that April 4 be designated as [Children's Day] and publish the Modern Parents Monthly</p>
<h3>A Review of the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>January 1, 1933. The sound of cannons destroying world peace originated from a corner of the Far East, beyond Shanhaiguan. This cannonball was similar to the one fired at Sarajevo, and the seriousness of the situation was extremely similar. The world's powers mostly focused their attention on the changes in the Far Eastern political situation. However, the revelation of facts seemed to exceed general expectations. That is, after the Shanhaiguan incident occurred, the explosive power of this cannonball only reached the east bank of the Luan River. And the powers that focused their attention on the East, only focused their attention. There was no further indication. Until the Rehe problem followed the sound of the Shanhaiguan cannons. When the sound of cannons in Rehe was booming, it was the time when the Geneva Disarmament Conference was being held. We don't need to study the technical issues of this disarmament, but it is a unique and extraordinary thing in the world to talk about morality while the flames of war are raging on one side. It is enough to prove the bleak future of disarmament. We certainly know that disputes between countries can only be resolved by force. However, in this disheveled and struggling state, what is somewhat comforting is that world justice has not been completely buried. That is, the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on February 24, with a unanimous vote of forty-two, declared the so-called [Manchukuo] to be a forgery and confirmed the report and recommendations made by the Nineteen-Member Committee. Although there is no actual binding force, it can still represent the general public opinion of the world. Since then, the world situation has deteriorated, and the crisis of economic panic has gradually been exposed. The United States of America, possessing almost half of the world's gold, experienced an unprecedented financial turmoil at the beginning of the new President Roosevelt's inauguration. Even millionaires became destitute overnight. What is the impact of such an event on the world? It is almost inevitable that the United States will abandon the gold standard and adopt an inflationary policy.</p>
<p>Since the world economy has been greatly shocked by the US financial panic, what will the future hold? Even the people involved are mostly apprehensive. Advanced countries are even more concerned. Therefore, they regard the World Economic Conference as the key to solving current difficult problems. If the countries can truly abandon their past prejudices and implement international cooperation, then production agreements can be established, sales markets may be equalized, and technical issues such as currency exchange rates will not be difficult to find appropriate solutions. The current economic difficulties may not be insurmountable. Unfortunately, the historical disputes between countries are too deep, and the conflicts of interest are too fierce. As a result, international cooperation has only become a diplomatic formality, and economic nationalism has become the foundation of economic alliances. The war debt problem cannot be solved at the Economic Conference, and inflation and stabilizing international exchange rates have become mutually opposed. Coupled with the difficulty of reducing tariff barriers, the cracks between countries have become even deeper as a result.</p>
<p>At this time, the United States could only try its best to calm its already exposed panic. Britain was engaged in consolidating its economic alliance within the empire. France wanted to take the lead in European finance. Germany was eager for an economic way out. Japan continued its military adventure policy. The Soviet Union also shifted from cold observation to focusing on war preparations. The Eastern issue seemed to be a hidden current on the surface, but in reality, it was deteriorating. Although the twenty-second year of the Republic of China has barely passed, based on the past experience and lessons of hardship, we can predict the future. Under this four-sided pressure, how will our country strive to eliminate the current crisis in the coming year?</p>
<p>Shanxi Coal Industry Representatives Petition for Reduction of Shanxi Coal Freight</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Renxian and other representatives of the coal industry from Jinyangquan Station in Shanxi came to Nanjing to petition, requesting a reduction in Shanxi coal freight. According to reporters, the amount of coal stored in Shanxi accounts for more than 58% of the country. The province's Zuoyun and other 57 counties are all coal-producing areas. There are a total of 1,523 mining companies or kiln factories, with a total of 37,518 workers. The annual output is 3,745,475 tons. The sluggish sales of domestic coal are actually due to the low-priced dumping of foreign coal, which is difficult for domestic coal to resist. Rural bankruptcy is also affected. Excessive freight rates prevent long-distance sales, and excessive taxes increase costs, making sales difficult. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>The Naval Department Will Send Personnel to Italy to Study</p>
<p>(Nanjing) China and Italy have friendly relations. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in order to enhance the friendly relations between the two countries, instructed the new Italian ambassador to China to express goodwill to the naval authorities and welcome the Chinese Navy to send personnel to study in the Italian Navy and will give special preferential treatment. This is the first time that the Chinese Navy has sent personnel to study in Italy. The Naval Department is currently selecting outstanding personnel and preparing their luggage. They can set off in January or February of the new year. In the future, the friendly relations between China and Italy will naturally increase. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Litvinov Sternly Denounces Japan's Breach of Faith and Provocation Against Russia</h3>
<p>Using Cunning Means to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Japanese Policy is a Shadow in International Politics</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov reported on the international situation to the Central Executive Committee today, directly denouncing Japan's breach of faith, saying that Japan had promised not to harm the interests of Russians in Manchuria. The Soviet Union deeply believed in its words. Unexpectedly, after the September 18th Incident, Japan directly attacked the interests of the Soviet Union and hindered the business of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Japan wanted to obtain the Chinese Eastern Railway as a gift from the Soviet Union. Therefore, it did not hesitate to use cunning means to seize the railway with the help of police, bandits and the Manchurian Self-Defense Army. Russian-Japanese relations are now attracting worldwide attention because Japan's policy is the darkest shadow in the international political sky. Litvinov spoke in a satisfactory tone about the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, but unfortunately, China is still suffering from the invasion of neighboring enemies and the internal disputes are serious. Litvinov also said that Japan has heavily concentrated its forces near the Manchurian border, which endangers the Soviet border. The Soviet Union has to send a large delegation to consolidate its border defense. The Soviet Union does not threaten Japan, but Japan's first step must be to show its will for peace in fact. Japan must stop its violent police activities on the Chinese Eastern Railway, restore the infringed Soviet Russian rights, reopen negotiations on the fair sale and purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and sign the non-aggression treaty proposed by the Soviet Union two years ago. Today, we have an impression that the Japanese authorities in Manchuria clearly want to incite behavior that is more serious than protest. The Soviet Union is currently only adopting a defensive plan, while Japan is preparing for an aggressive war. Litvinov then compared Germany and Japan and issued a warning to the Socialist Party, saying that if the National Socialist Party wants to realize its dream of colonizing Ukraine or elsewhere, the Soviet Russian government will definitely oppose it. Litvinov finally mentioned Geneva, saying that the disarmament conference may be revived temporarily, but even if it can be revived, it will only be a conference to reorganize armaments rather than reduce armaments. Only when all countries no longer regard the non-aggression treaty as waste paper can there be a real discussion of the disarmament issue. Under such circumstances, the Soviet Russian government has to increase and improve its necessary national defense, because the Soviet Union cannot guarantee that there will not be a time when it must maintain Stalin's declaration that the Soviet Union will not give up an inch of land. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Full Text of Russian Foreign Minister's Speech</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov reported on the international situation and Soviet foreign policy at the General Assembly of the Central Executive Committee. Litvinov elaborated on the current stage of the development of international life and said that the era of bourgeois pacifism has passed. The central issues of diplomatic negotiations and conferences in Geneva are no longer disarmament, but expansion and reorganization of armaments. At the same time, newly rising political parties, new factions, and new figures have risen with a new military spirit and new ideologies. These newly rising political parties declared anti-communist movements, but under the cover of such struggles, they secretly carried out narrowly scoped nationalist aspirations, namely revising treaties and seizing territories. And its revision also includes those that are explicitly stipulated in the treaty, or even those that are not recorded. Litvinov continued, [If the fortune of war once smiles on them, then they will not be limited to the territories held by the Marxists they hate, and will also involve the territories of the bourgeoisie, even the territories ruled by rulers with similar ideas are inevitable. This is the situation in a certain European country. At the same time, there is a country that does not borrow any psychological or even theoretical complex preparation work, and from the beginning takes the revision of the border, the replacement of the agreement, and its implementation, without diplomats but only relying on generals. These generals always lead their troops across the vast Asian continent, regarding all borders and the interests of the people as worn-out shoes,] (omitted) Litvinov continued, [The key to Soviet foreign policy has been fully expressed by Stalin's concise formula, namely, we do not want foreign territory, but we also do not want to lose an inch of our territory, so we never hope for war. As for our territory, we have been able to guarantee it with increasing military power, and can make foreign forces dare not approach and covet it. This kind of military power can also teach our neighbors near and far, and they can live in their own borders in peace for decades. We are working hard to establish and maintain friendship with all countries, so we focus on consolidating diplomatic relations with countries in the world that truly want to maintain peace and at the same time prepare to oppose those who destroy peace, and practice the highest degree of amity. In the past and present, we have never refused organized international cooperation to defend peace, and we have never refused to use these existing or formable international associations and organizations, if we have reason to deeply believe that these combinations are beneficial to peace,</p>
<p>Amity with the United States, Turkey, France, and Italy Litvinov mentioned the relationship between the Soviet Union and various countries, starting with the United States. He said that the United States intends to maintain peace and believes that its good relations with the Soviet Union can be a powerful factor in maintaining peace, so it attaches great importance to the cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in this regard. As for our side, we also take maintaining peace as the starting point for attaching importance to this matter, and believe that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is of value. When Litvinov mentioned Turkey, he said, [We believe that the Soviet-Turkish diplomatic relations are a model for our diplomatic relations with other countries. The policy of friendship and mutual trust can also build a foundation for effective cooperation in international politics. If one party proposes a proposal to consolidate peace, it can obtain the assistance of the other party in advance. If such relations can be established among the people of all countries, the problem of peace will be solved.] Litvinov continued, [When we describe the gradual and important increase in relations with other countries, we should first discuss France. This year, our relationship with France has made great and rapid progress. The alliance between the Soviet Union and France is maintained by a common desire to sincerely seek peace. We do not need to worry that the repeated changes in the French government will affect the smooth development of this close relationship. Recently, Herriot and Cot's visit to the Soviet Union has given new impetus to the friendship between France and the Soviet Union. It is expected that the progress of this friendship will be even more rapid, because the elements that threaten peace are now gathering. Our diplomatic relations with Italy have been unusually stable for ten years. Whether in economic or political issues, there has never been a change or tension. When I recently visited Italy, I received a warm welcome. This is enough to prove that both countries are willing to develop their relations in economic and political aspects.</p>
<p>British-Russian Relations Have Not Yet Been Stabilized Unfortunately, our hope to enhance diplomatic relations with major powers has not been fully realized for Britain. Soviet-British relations are still unstable, because there are still elements within Britain who dream of a united struggle of capitalism to resist socialist countries. However, we hope that the temporary trade agreement that will be signed this time will make it possible to enhance British-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>Actively Promoting Good Neighborly Policies When Litvinov mentioned the Soviet Union's neighboring countries, he said that the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact and the Convention on the Definition of Aggression has increased mutual trust and understanding between the Soviet Union and Poland. He strongly stated that there is a common interest between the two countries, and this relationship is also a product of common dangers and troubles between the two countries. [If we and Poland do not consciously realize the common nature of these troubles, then those who create these troubles will agitate us to experience them. ] Litvinov also mentioned the Soviet Union's eastern neighbors, saying that the Soviet Union is linked with Persia and Afghanistan by non-aggression pacts. At the same time, Karakhan's trip to Persia has made the Soviet-Persian relationship particularly friendly. Although the Soviet Union and the Little Entente countries do not have normal diplomatic relations, they have signed a convention on the definition of aggression. This convention shows that the signatory countries have the desire to maintain peace in Europe. At the same time, the divergence of opinions with Romania has not yet been resolved, which makes the above-mentioned convention even more important. As for the Soviet Union and Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Greece, and other countries, they have always maintained normal diplomatic relations and have been improving them. Relations with Spain have been revived.</p>
<p>Sympathy for China's Internal and External Troubles When Litvinov mentioned the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and China, he expressed satisfaction and said that the Soviet Union has accepted the Chinese government's proposal to conclude a non-aggression pact, and the draft of the treaty is being examined by the Chinese government. He expressed regret that China is still being invaded by a foreign enemy and has profound internal strife.</p>
<p>No Hostility Towards the German Nation In concluding his glimpse of the Soviet Union's international status, Litvinov elaborated on the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany and Japan. Starting with Germany, he said that for ten years, Germany and the Soviet Union have had close relations in economic and political aspects, and both countries have been blessed by this relationship. Until this year, the German side discovered various speeches, statements, and actions that violated previous diplomatic relations, which made diplomatic relations deteriorate. Litvinov asked the audience to recall the existence of the following ideas, that is, guns and knives are the usual road for Germany to expand and develop, and personnel in responsible positions who enslaved the Soviet Union have repeatedly made anti-Soviet Russian suggestions and negotiations, and are becoming more active with the above-mentioned ideological system. At this point, Litvinov reiterated the systematic abuse of Soviet Russian institutions and citizens by the German authorities. Some people have tried to attribute the change in German-Soviet Russian diplomatic relations to the Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with the current regime in Germany. Litvinov strongly refuted the fallacy of this statement. He said, we sympathize with the persecution of German comrades, but we Marxists will never be blamed for letting emotions drive politics, and the world knows that we can maintain good relations with capitalist countries under any government, even fascist governments. German politicians once asked me how Germany would dispel the Soviet Union's doubts about Germany's attitude. I always replied, [Germany must stop what it is doing now, and the German government must notify its subordinates to stop what they are doing now. ] We are willing to maintain the best relations with Germany and other countries. We do not plan to make any expansion in the East or the West. We have no hostility towards the German nation and have no intention of invading their territory and rights. We will never encourage other countries to make such an attempt. We hope that Germany can make the same statement to us, and hope that the facts that occur will not contradict this, and at the same time hope that this kind of statement is not only valid for the present, but also when Germany has greater power to implement its aggressive ideas (this kind of thinking was already promoted before the current leaders of Germany took office and is now being promoted by some people) is also valid. ]</p>
<p>Japan's Provocation is Intolerable When Litvinov mentioned the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan, he said that this relationship has attracted the attention of the world, because Japan's policy is a rumbling black cloud in the international political world. We have almost no so-called national defense in the Far East. Our trust in Japan has always been such. However, since Japan started its military operations in Manchuria, the situation has changed greatly. Japan has made various empty and unbelievable explanations for this. The Japanese government has formally guaranteed to us that our interests, especially our interests on the Chinese Eastern Railway, will not be harmed. This guarantee has been repeatedly stated, and at the same time, the Japanese army continued to advance until they completely occupied Manchuria and created their so-called [Manchukuo]. At this time, regardless of the above-mentioned permissions, they suddenly exerted their power to destroy our interests, and the business of the railway was interrupted. At that time, the whole world was surprised by our calmness and patience. However, the more calm and patient we were, the more shameless and provocative the behavior of the Japanese authorities in Manchuria became. Because we did not want to be hooked by the provocation, we were willing to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway, only trying to recover the cost of the railway. However, during the negotiations, we have confirmed that Japan does not want to buy this railway, but only wants to obtain the railway as a gift without spending a penny. The Japanese representatives did not use verbal negotiations, but used special methods, relying on the assistance of the police and White Russian criminals in Manchuria to forcibly occupy the railway. The Japanese people claimed that Japan had nothing to do with these illegal actions, and the responsible party should be the [independent] Manchukuo. Litvinov strongly refuted the absurdity of this statement. He said, [When we and the world talk about this kind of independence, we have our own views. ]</p>
<p>Gathering Troops on the Border, Russia is Threatened Litvinov pointed out that Japanese troops are currently heavily concentrated on the Manchurian border, military equipment is being transported, and roads and railways are being built. He continued, [This threat is not only to the Chinese Eastern Railway but also to the Soviet border. Our government has to strengthen our national defense and transport the necessary troops. We do not want war. We do not want to threaten Japan. What we ask is that they can also respect our rights and interests.</p>
<p>A Sincere Intention for Peace Should Have Indication If Japan wants to prove its peaceful intentions, the first step should be to stop the policy of arbitrary police action on the Chinese Eastern Railway and restore our destroyed rights. Then continue to negotiate the commercial price of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The second step should be to conclude a non-aggression pact. We wish to hope that Japan's actions will follow the sensitive advice of enlightened patriots in the country, and should not listen to the advice of military adventurers.</p>
<p>International Disarmament Turns into Military Expansion Litvinov concluded this report by mentioning the disarmament conference. He said that this conference can still be regarded as surviving and can still be revived for some time. [However, this is no longer a disarmament conference, but a conference to reorganize armaments. When people talk about reorganizing armaments on one part and reducing armaments on another part, we are afraid that only the first part of this formula can be implemented, not its second part, because the General Assembly can never let those countries that are using their armaments reduce their disarmament, and they openly threaten to use their armaments on a larger scale in the near future. All countries can not regard the non-aggression pact as waste paper, and we can solemnly negotiate disarmament again. Since we are willing to cooperate with other countries, we must keep in mind that the capitalist countries we are targeting have unstable governments and are constantly changing. At the same time, these countries may be ruled by elements who are prepared to sacrifice national interests.</p>
<p>Increase the Strength of the Red Army to Prepare for Possible Attacks</p>
<p>We will have to go out to defend ourselves at this scene and strengthen and improve the main guarantee of our security, namely the Red Army, the Red Navy, and the Red Air Force, as always, and even more than before. We should keep this in mind, that is, even with our aspirations, the time will come when they will summon us to verify Stalin's statement that we will not lose an inch of land. At that time, not only the Red Army soldiers, but the Red People of our Great Federation will go out to defend every inch of land in the East and West of the Soviet Union. The Soviet People, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Stalin, will be able to guarantee that they have a victory in the military field that is on the same scale as the victory they have already obtained. ] (TASS dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Finance: Gold Price Drops Slightly by $3.60</p>
<p>Silver Futures and Spot Prices Both Decline, Previous Rise Proves Fleeting</p>
<p>Favorable News for Silver Prices Triggers Reversal and Weakness</p>
<p>The gold market, due to the approaching year-end, tended to stabilize. However, adverse overseas news made it difficult to sustain. In the morning, overseas silver markets rose in England but remained flat in the U.S., exchange rates dropped slightly, and forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange fell between 2.5 and 3.5 percent. London raw gold fell by one penny, and the official U.S. buying price of gold remained unchanged. Stock prices experienced both increases and decreases, U.S. cotton shrank by five points, and U.S. wheat was down by a small amount of two and a half points, which improved sentiment. The initial price for processed silver was $84.50, and Guang Gang (Guangdong merchants) accepted the price, causing it to rise to $6. However, because Datong, Ruixing, and others took advantage of the high price to supply silver, prices flattened again. After the opening, Reuters reported that 18 U.S. senators claimed they supported free and unlimited coinage of bimetallic money (gold and silver), and Senator Heller had issued a notice stating he would propose holding a meeting on a gold-silver ratio, changing the ratio to 1:16, before Congress. Due to these adverse messages about to emerge, the domestic market hardened, and sentiment turned bearish. Traders rushed to sell off their holdings, and Guang Gang also sold, leading to prices becoming unsustainable and gradually declining. Before the midday close, prices even broke the $80 mark, as rumors worsened. The price of smelted silver was also at $1,054. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at $684.30, an increase of $1.10 from the previous close. Spot goods opened at $4.20. Exchange rates opened with near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, 9375, and U.S. exchange at $33.8125. Yongfeng bought silver bars, pushing the price up to $4.70, but as Qiao Zhifu sought to buy U.S. exchange, the domestic market eased. Reuters news favored silver prices, and Datong, Zhifeng, Yongtongxing, Yongruixing, Hengtai, Yuanmao, Yonghengxing, Qianchangxiang, and others successively sold silver bars, causing prices to fall to $1. It was anticipated that HSBC would quote British exchange flat and U.S. exchange down by 125. Shunli, Yuanmao, Yong and others took advantage of the low prices to buy silver bars, and HSBC also unloaded May U.S. dollars at 3125, lowering the price to $3. However, sentiment remained bearish, and Datong and Shunmao sold silver bars. Shanghai also unloaded March U.S. dollars at 75, pushing the price down to within $2. Later, Yuan Cang, Yongheng, Yu, Shenkang were on the buying side, while Shengda and Datong were selling. This led to a prolonged struggle around $2. When adverse news spread, the domestic market hardened, and Yuanmao found it difficult to advance. Finally, with Hengxing repeatedly supplying and Heng, Yu, Huixiang, Yifeng, Yong and others also selling, prices fell to $78. HSBC unloaded April U.S. dollars at 1875, and Yiyu worked hard to buy, gradually pushing prices back up to over $80. Ruikang and Tianfeng sold off, and after much struggle, the midday close was at $679.60. Spot goods were auctioned at $9.20, rising to around $80 after the market closed. It was observed that the highest price during the half-day was $684.70, and the lowest was $678, a difference of $6.70. The result was a drop of $3.60 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was due to HSBC Bank reducing its U.S. dollar quotation by 125, to $33.25, making the standard gold price $721.80. According to the closing price, about $42 was withheld, $6 more than the previous close. This month's silver bars were all settled at $725.80, January registration at $689, and February at $680. Morning water replenishment was at $695. The price of smelted silver was $1,054. Trading in the market was sluggish, and out-of-town traders were quiet. Only Dafeng and Heng sold 100 taels to Datong for $1,057. The Hongkou bank sold to Yingfeng Heng for $1,054.50, but trading was not high. Finally, $1,057 was offered by someone who needed it, but there were no sellers. There were 1,841 silver bars remaining for January.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was confusing. In summary, Yiyu, Shenkang, Yuanmao, Yonghengtai, Hongxing, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Maofu, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, Wanxing, and Shunli were on the buying side. Ruikang, Ruixing, Datong, Yicheng, Chunyuan, Yongyi, Dayongheng, Yu, Yuanchun, Changsheng, Yongfu, Taiheng, Bingxing, Dafa, Yongxiang, and Dahexingyong were on the selling side. Shengda Hengxing Yongfeng Yifengyong were net sellers, while Qianchangxiang and Yuanmaoyong were initially sellers then became buyers. The Dalian merchants and Shunli traded around 1,400, with a net purchase of over 200 silver bars. Wanxing traded a total of over 1,100, with a net purchase of over 300 silver bars. The Guangdong merchants Shengda were initially sellers then became buyers, about 600 bars each. Hengxing purchased over 300 and sold over 400. There were a total of 40,481 February contracts.</p>
<p>As of the previous day, for February silver bars, the long positions included Fuchang and Qianchangxiang with over 5,000 each, Wanxing with over 4,300, Yifengyong with over 3,100, Yuanshengyong and Yuanheng Hongxing Hengyu with over 2,000 each, Zhaofengchang with 1,600, Fuyu with 1,819, Run Changyu with over 1,300, and Ruixing Yiyu with over 1,000, and Shunli Yongfeng with over 900 each. The short positions included Yuanmaoyong with over 6,700, Huixiang with over 2,800, Tianfeng and Dachangxiang Dahengxingyong with over 1,800 or 1,900 each, Bingxing with over 2,300, Changshengyong with 1,400, Shenkang Taifeng Cheng with over 1,200 each, Yuanchun and Hengxing with over 800 each, Dacheng with over 900, and Huiyuan Yuanxingyong and Yongfengcheng with over 700 each. In total, there were 31 long positions and 65 short positions.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Tightens and Then Loosens</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress to Propose Gold-Silver Ratio ###</h3>
<p>丨丨 One to Sixteen 丨丨</p>

Compared to the previous close, the British pound tightened by 0625 and the U.S. dollar tightened by 125. Although banks unloaded after the opening, the market loosened due to Reuters reports that U.S. Senator Heller would propose a gold-silver ratio of 1:16. When HSBC's quotes were revealed, British Indian, and He's new quotes remained unchanged, U.S. exchange contracted by 125, French exchange fell by 2 French francs, and Hong Kong and German exchange contracted by 25. At this time, the market was slightly flat, but Qiao Zhifu and Chinese merchants continued to buy, keeping prices firm. The near-term selling prices at the midday close were British exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 0625, and U.S. exchange at $34.0625.

<p>Year-End Silver Dollar Transfers Exceptionally Busy</p>
<p>Although yesterday was a Saturday, the market atmosphere was usually calm. However, since this year's New Year's Eve falls on a Sunday, all silver and money transfers that should be handled within the year had to be concluded early yesterday. Therefore, everything was exceptionally complicated. Even routine transfers were hindered by excessive procedures and impossible to investigate immediately. The market price for silver dollar discounts was nine fen in both the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day, with a head mark and a water charge of two or three fen. In discount ticket transactions, over 4.6 million was transferred in the morning, with over 550,000 in new transactions. Afternoon transactions amounted to over 440,000, and transactions in the small general association were over 60,000. Over 1.2 million in paper money was recovered, and over 1.4 million was issued. Silver mortgage transactions amounted to over 1.4 million, with a customer source of 500,000 and an outflow of 300,000. The silver dollar public document transfers from money shops were over 5.1 million, and remittances from various sources were over 700,000. The silver dollar head mark transactions were also impossible to investigate, with over 1 million received in cash. Furthermore, the total amount exchanged at the city's clearing house was 18,086,444.02 silver dollars, including 9,756,851.72 silver dollars and 8,329,592.30 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Returns to Calm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins were 829 yuan in both the morning and afternoon, a slight decrease of three yuan from the previous day's morning. Trading volume was 5,500 jiao in the morning and 7,500 jiao in the afternoon. The Guangdong small silver coins were 793.9 yuan in the morning and 794.5 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon. Trading volume was 65,000 jiao in the morning and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins decreased by 1,500 wen, to 292,000 wen, with 34,164 strings traded, equivalent to 11,700 yuan.</p>
<p>Securities: February Public Bonds Launched Yesterday</p>
<p>The Market Initially Rises Then Falls</p>
<p>Many Bulls Exit the Market</p>
<p>Resulting in a General Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the February futures of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange started trading. In the morning, all except the "18 Customs" bonds opened successively. The market was quite favorable, and trends varied due to slight shifts between long and short positions, with both increases and decreases. "Troop Reduction" bonds increased by another three jiao due to continued demand. "Salt Tax" bonds also saw a slight increase. "Gold Long" bonds surged by as much as nine and a half jiao. The remaining bonds saw smaller increases of two or three jiao. In the secondary session, guest merchants and "No. 21" bonds both experienced selling, and market prices gradually turned sluggish, with a general decline of one or two jiao to six or seven jiao. In the afternoon, rumors surfaced, and it was said that "1922 Customs Treasury Bonds" would be auctioned starting January 4, 1923, causing a surge in selling. "Troop Reduction" and "19 Customs" bonds plummeted by one yuan. Later, with Northern merchants covering their short positions, the market stabilized, but still declined by three or four jiao. At the close, only a few transactions were settled, and the market was extremely stable, with prices mostly fluctuating by only one or two jiao. As a result, prices declined by four or five jiao to 1.2 yuan. It was noted that yesterday was the last day of 1922, and there would be a four-day holiday for the New Year and the weekend. Therefore, most floating long and short positions were settled to avoid the risks of a four-day break. Given the unpredictable political situation, many bulls exited the market at the end of the year. The total trading volume was 22.33 million yuan. There were no spot transactions. Futures trading, including salt tax, totaled 7,965,000 yuan, with "Troop Reduction" bonds accounting for 5,570,000 yuan, "1 Yuan Customs Surtax" for 1,475,000 yuan, "20 Coupon 20 Customs" for 3,650,000 yuan, and "Gold Short Gold Long" for 1,390,000 yuan. The remaining transactions ranged from tens of thousands to over a million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the stock market will be closed for three days for the New Year holiday on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of the New Year.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Mixed</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 29th saw a slight market fatigue due to bulls taking profits as the holiday approached. However, public utility stocks, wet stocks, and a few special stocks remained firm. U.S. government bonds were stable, while speculative railway and public utility bonds rose due to enthusiastic buyers. The total stock trading volume for the day was 1.13 million shares. Wheat futures fell due to professional speculators selling off. Cotton futures were optimistic about the market's ability to absorb year-end selling, with hopes for a gradual rise in market conditions next year. The price of newly purchased gold for financial settlement was $34.06 per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 98.67 Down 0.62</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 40.42 Down 0.06</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 23.10 Up 0.04</p>
<p>40 Bonds 84.35 Up 0.38</p>
<p>11 Commodities 48.30 Down 0.51</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Stagnant</p>
<p>The yarn market is quiet, and spot yarn prices have not changed significantly. However, sales to out-of-town merchants remain sluggish. The standard futures yarn market is closed for year-end settlement, and there are very few people gathering in the market. Some anticipate a slight price increase when the market reopens after the New Year. However, the domestic economic situation is difficult to be optimistic about. Total purchases by out-of-town merchants were 434 bales, and prices were similar to the previous day. Purchases by various merchants are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 285 Mainland 99 Guangdong 50</p>
<p>The cotton market is stable. The overseas cotton market has not changed much, and factory demand is active, so the market atmosphere is better. Sources include 414 bales of Yaohua cotton and 807 bales of Tonghua cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton $44.00 Shanghai factory purchases 364 pieces Sent to the factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton $43.00 Yufeng factory purchases 130 pieces Sent to the factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton $46.50 Fengtian factory purchases 300 pieces Sent to the factory</p>
<p>Xiasha Cotton $38.25 Shenxin factory purchases 500 pieces Sent to the factory</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Fluctuates Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially firmed due to purchases by traders, then weakened due to bulls taking profits, and finally rose again due to short covering. As a result, spot prices fell by five points, and futures prices fell by one to five points. British cotton spot prices fell by four points, and futures prices rose and fell by three or four points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. The Indian cotton market was quiet and lacked features, with Pingguer falling by one rupee, Aomula falling by half a rupee, and Bailuoxi falling by 2.5 jiao.

<p>U.S. Cotton Shows Promising Signs</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 29th reported on the cotton market during the week, stating that trading was limited during the past week, but the market trended upward, demand was slightly active, Southern supply was thin, and stock and grain prices improved. There was also talk of activity in the cotton trade next spring. Currently, selling pressure is extremely light, and industry insiders believe that there will be a turnaround in all industries after the New Year. The statistical position of raw cotton is also gradually becoming stronger, so hopes are high. However, domestic market conditions are slightly gloomy due to the instability of the gold standard environment. At the same time, some believe that government mortgages have established a minimum base of one jiao for cotton prices. If the spring reduction planting campaign is successful and all industries tend to recover, then cotton prices will at least fluctuate between one jiao and 1.5 jiao.</p>

<p>Grains: The Hexia Rice Market Shows No Excitement</p>
<h3>Clash Between Dock Porters and Cart Drivers in Northern Shanghai Halts Morning Rice Sales</h3>
<p>(Southern Shanghai) Few boats arrived from various sources yesterday, only about 30, and both retail and wholesale demand were limited. Only merchants from Nanyang and Xiamen purchased a load of Luxu thick japonica rice, about 100 bales, and those who went to the warehouses took in a load of Songjiang late rice, over 110 bales. In addition, the street shops also only replenished their inventory. The situation was quiet, and the market remained flat. Prices for various thick japonica rice, late rice, and Duyang tip rice showed no changes. Supply and demand matched well, and there was no excitement. (Northern Shanghai) There were over 20 arrivals from various sources. Due to a dispute between dock porters and cart drivers over carrying rice, the morning rice sales were halted. Only in the afternoon did merchants resume sales, and trading volume was sparse. The market was similar to yesterday. Minxian Rice Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>丨丨 4,500 New Bags of Jiangxi Machine Rice Arrive 丨丨</p>
<p>The Minxian rice market was calm yesterday, as buyers inquired and both market sentiment and prices remained stable. Merchants from Fujian were slightly more active, with those from Fuzhou and Quanzhou both preparing shipments. The street also made some inquiries. However, warehouse owners still intended to press down prices slightly before making further inquiries. Rice from Hexia arrived on the street, and intake was not as active as that of the Fujian merchants. The street only sold 136 bags of Wuhu machine Yuan rice at a price of 7 yuan and 7 jiao. Quanzhou sold 160 bags of Hunan machine red rice at a price of 6 yuan and 8 jiao. Fuzhou merchants purchased 130 bags of Hunan rough Jing rice at a price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. 90 bags of Jiangxi machine early rice were priced at 6 yuan and 3 jiao and 2 fen. 350 bags of Jiangbei machine rice were priced at 6 yuan and 9 jiao. Prices were similar to the previous day. There were no other transactions. There are still over 130,000 bags of rice stored in Shanghai, mostly Hunan rice. However, yesterday there were 4,500 new bags of Jiangxi machine early and late rice that arrived. The owners have not fully displayed samples due to the flat market. Dalian Soybeans Arrive and Are Sold</p>
<p>Since the imposition of taxes, Dalian soybeans have not arrived in large quantities. Recently, there has been a sharp decline in Dalian prices, which aligns with Shanghai's capabilities. Therefore, since last month, 40 to 50 train cars have arrived. The market price is still stable. 10 train cars were sold over the past two days. Yesterday's selling price was still 4 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, and 4 train cars were sold. In addition, Shantou merchants purchased 500 bags of Niuzhuang White Eyebrow soybeans, also priced at 4 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. This type of soybean is sold as soon as it arrives, and the market shows no excitement. Although the market atmosphere for each type of soybean is stable, the foundation is unstable. The large amount of soybeans waiting to be loaded and transported in Bengbu has made the market sentiment unstable. Yesterday's sales included 8 to 9 train cars of various soybeans sold to factories for export to the mainland and on the street. Only the prices of medium and lower quality goods rose by another two or three fen.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Wheat Market - Central</p>
<p>Southerners eat rice, Northerners eat wheat. In the southern market, wheat is a type of miscellaneous grain, not comparable to rice. In the last ten years or so, southern wheat, especially Shanghai wheat, has occupied an important position in food consumption. This is the result of the development of the mechanized flour industry and a testament to changing tastes.</p>
<p>Before 1921, wheat was generally able to meet the demand with minor imports. But things changed drastically from 1922 onward. In the most recent two years, 22 million dan were imported in 1931, and 15 million dan in 1932. These are the import quantities for the entire country, but most of it was sold in Shanghai. Thus, Shanghai has a close relationship with foreign wheat.</p>
<p>The demand for large quantities of foreign wheat in Shanghai is due to the flour milling industry in the Shanghai area (including Wuxi) being the largest in the country. In order to ensure the color and quantity of the flour, the flour mills must use more foreign wheat. In addition, the decline in the quality of domestic wheat and the reduction in production have further created opportunities for foreign wheat sales. A comparative observation of the table below clearly demonstrates the relationship between foreign wheat and Shanghai. (Unit: 1,000 dan)</p>
<p>Total National Imports Shanghai Imports</p>
<p>1922 873 831</p>
<p>1923 2,595 2,212</p>
<p>1924 5,145 4,663</p>
<p>1925 700 587</p>
<p>1926 4,156 4,065</p>
<p>1927 1,690 1,646</p>
<p>1928 903 789</p>
<p>1929 5,663 5,464</p>
<p>1930 2,762 2,391</p>
<p>1931 22,773 19,419</p>
<p>1932 15,084 11,021</p>
<p>Therefore, Shanghai flour and wheat merchants felt the pinch first when the import tax on wheat was increased. If the tax increase were for the purpose of protecting domestic agricultural products, it would have been something generally desired. However, observing that the government has only issued the order to tax wheat but has not heard of any possibility of tax exemption in the future, it is clear that the tax increase is more focused on revenue generation.</p>
<p>While Shanghai needs large quantities of foreign wheat, it also needs huge amounts of domestic wheat. The source of domestic wheat is from ships coming from the Jiang and Hai regions, and the quantities are recorded in the customs registers. However, the domestic wheat produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, as well as the wheat from Anhui and Huai that comes to Shanghai by train, are not included in the customs registers. The following figures are compiled from customs records and are already substantial. If the quantities not covered by the customs records could also be included in the statistics, the amounts would certainly be greater. The table below compares the net import numbers of domestic wheat for each customs office with Shanghai's import numbers. However, the numbers are revised downward each year, which is the opposite of the annual increase in foreign wheat imports. The table is as follows: Unit: 1,000 dan</p>
<p>Total Domestic Wheat Imports to All Customs Offices Shanghai Imports</p>
<p>1922 553 412</p>
<p>1923 199 79</p>
<p>1924 1,523 982</p>
<p>1925 2,085 1,562</p>
<p>1926 597 505</p>
<p>1927 1,156 978</p>
<p>1928 1,519 344</p>
<p>1929 1,083 617</p>
<p>1930 1,084 1,042</p>
<p>1931 590 77</p>
<p>1932 1,107 54</p>
<p>This year, the amount of domestic wheat coming to Shanghai will be huge, and the amount of foreign wheat will certainly not be small. Besides the merchants, there is also the American wheat from the government's cotton and wheat loan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Little Hope for a Turnaround in European and American Silk Markets</p>
<p>(Interior Silkworm Cocoons Transported to Shanghai for Sale) Shanghai silk factories, since the autumn, have experienced stagnant exports and plummeting silk prices, a rare decline in the silk market since its inception. The silk factories are burdened with stockpiles of silk, making it impossible to sustain operations. Many have declared bankruptcy. The Suzhou and Zhejiang silk factory guilds have repeatedly convened meetings, resolving to petition the government to establish a silk industry control association for relief. They have also organized a joint sales office to investigate silk inventories and cocoon quantities in various ports in order to find ways to promote sales. Shanghai's silkworm cocoon inventory was originally only 54,614 dan. However, because interior merchants transported dry cocoons stored in Wuxi and other ports to Shanghai for sale, Shanghai's silkworm cocoon inventory increased by 802 dan, bringing the total to 55,416 dan.</p>
<p>(Zhejiang Filature Dry Silk Exports to America Remain Stagnant) Zhejiang filature exports to America have been stagnant for a long time, and there has been no turnaround in sales since winter. In the past ten days, only ten bales of white dry silk were shipped to New York via U.S. mail.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Clear Before Year-End) As the year-end approaches in the local artificial silk market, customer sales are clearing, and prices are also weakening. Yesterday, only local Shanghai silk factories purchased 14 cases of "Lantern" and "Tonggu" brand spot goods (small cases of 100 pounds, numbers 200 to 280), priced at 195.75 to 188.25 yuan net (excluding customs duties).</p>
<p>(Yellow and White Coarse Silk Sales to India Are Scarce) The overseas raw silk market is not moving. The New York Silk Exchange's price remains stable due to bulls heavily selling. The British market is flooded with Japanese silk, and Chinese silk is expensive, with no buyers. Shanghai has not received any positive telegrams, and the market atmosphere is quiet. Sales of yellow and white coarse silk to India are scarce. Yesterday, only Kechang and others purchased 4 bales of yellow reeled silk, 3 bales of silk, and 5 bales of dry silk, with prices remaining weak.</p>

<h3>Abolishing New Year Greetings</h3>
<p>— Careful Words</p>
<p>The term "New Year greetings" itself, I feel, is fundamentally somewhat incomprehensible. "Year" is merely a marker for calculating time, twelve months accumulating into a year, as commonplace and unremarkable as ten decimeters making a meter. Why must it necessarily be celebrated? Based on my personal speculation, the reason people in the past had this whole New Year greeting ritual was perhaps a form of consolation or encouragement. The idea was that now is the start of another year, please forget the past and strive to open up a new chapter! However, judging from the actions of people today, it seems absolutely not for this purpose. Upon meeting, they always greet you with a heap of smiling "Congratulations," and in written correspondence, it's always the four characters "Happy New Year." I truly don't understand what valuable thing I gained from the Republic of China transitioning from the 22nd to the 23rd year that warrants everyone uniformly congratulating me? I can't even begin to fathom what official position or wealth my relatives and friends have collectively attained in this new year that necessitates me congratulating them one by one? Thinking about it, on the contrary, I feel that time passes so quickly, year after year, someone has already died, and a friend is growing old. I barely have time to offer condolences, how can I then shout "Congratulations" to them, heartlessly deceiving them? As for myself, I also understand very well that precious youth is about to be taken away by time. Although I can't quite say I'm old, almost every New Year gives me an indication, saying, "You are one step closer to the realm of old age!" That being said, all my relatives and friends should be expressing regret for me, why should they be celebrating for me?</p>
<p>As for saying that no one escapes death, even though nearing old age, as long as your career is progressing, it is worth celebrating. But I dare say that in this year, especially in China, you shouldn't even think about making any progress in any career, let alone hope for any progress. If you are not one to dare to use ruthless means and have not forgotten that there are still the two words "humanity" in the dictionary, I believe that no matter what New Year begins, it is merely a sign that your career will decline another step, and it is difficult to maintain the status quo, how can you even think of any progress?</p>
<p>Summarizing the above two points, the change of year is fundamentally just a milestone in the journey of life. With each passing year, one is one step closer to death, fundamentally something to be mourned and not celebrated. If it is for celebrating each other's career progress, in this year, it is even more of a dream. Therefore, I advocate, I firmly advocate, that the act of New Year greetings must be abolished immediately! If someone says that New Year greetings mean celebrating a new environment or a new atmosphere, then I hope they go to the Xianxia Ridge on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang on a windless day to listen to the sounds of cannons!</p>
<h3>Three Excellences of Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Tinglin said, "People of the North, eat their fill all day, and have nothing to occupy their minds. People of the South gather in groups all day and do not speak of righteousness." Although this was said about the general scholars and officials of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, looking at the people of the North and South today, they are still the same old way, without any improvement. Mr. Wang Yuyang said, "Wu Valley has three excellences: cockfighting, playing mahjong, and eating pufferfish, worshiping the Five Gods. Even scholars and officials cannot avoid this, I wish I had the Emperor's sword to execute those who started this." Although this was also a lament from over two hundred years ago, it can still be used after more than two hundred years. The only difference is that mahjong has been changed to general's cards. However, eating pufferfish often causes life-threatening problems, and people in Suzhou today dare not eat it anymore. The Five Gods, once banned by Tang Bin in the Qianlong era and then banned by Wang Yincai after the National Revolution, no longer have the same awe-inspiring power as before. Now, the only pastime for scholars and officials is mahjong and general's cards; even the ladies and grandmothers are unhappy without it. Wang Chuanshan said mahjong destroyed the Ming dynasty, I say mahjong and general's cards will destroy the [people], I don't think that's an overstatement.</p>
<p>Because the winning or losing of mahjong and general's cards is a small problem, the waste of energy and time is a big problem. Although those who play cards do so in their spare time and it does not hinder their work, once they enter the card game, everything else is abandoned, and they still have to discuss and study after the game. How can this invisible consumption be recorded with numbers?</p>
<p>As for eating, Suzhou people were originally the most particular about it. But now they are far inferior to Shanghai people, because Shanghai can be said to have everything, and there is nothing strange that they don't have. As long as there is blood, they can taste something new. However, people in Suzhou have recently continued to fall into the trap of opium, and many young people have become addicted to this habit. Soon, they will look haggard, which is thousands of times more poisonous than pufferfish.</p>
<p>As for worshiping gods, it is not the Five Gods, but the "modern god." Whether male or female, what they strive for all day is modernity. Especially those young people, even more unwilling to lag behind others at all. So, even if they talk about the national goods year, they don't care. If they talk about the year of national subjugation, they still want to be modern. Moreover, the modernity they seek is only material decoration. If Mr. Gu and Mr. Wang were alive today, how would they lament!</p>
<h3>Stepfather</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The two words "stepfather" are a vulgar and unbearable term. In fact, "slow" and "fast" are opposites, "fast" just took precedence, then "slow" just fell behind! Therefore, "stepfather," from a more refined term, is simply "stepfather," nothing strange. For example, a husband, his wife dies, and soon after, he marries another wife. The daughter born to his previous wife cannot but recognize her as "mother," and nominally calls her "stepmother." Then, a widow, her husband dies, and later, she marries another man as her husband, commonly known as "filling the room." But this widow is not single, she already has children when her previous husband was alive. What would these children call their mother's current husband? Then, even if the person herself cares about face and refuses to call him that, in the eyes of others, they always say in the same tone, he is her "stepfather"!</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was a Mr. Chen, I will conceal his name. He was already over thirty years old, and also married. At first, he did business in Shanghai, and was quite fortunate. He had savings of five or six thousand, so he enjoyed the blessings at home and didn't want to develop abroad, thinking of himself as a wealthy man. Little did he know that "sitting and eating, three years of sea will be empty." His family situation became worse day by day, so a sudden inspiration came, and unable to vent his anger, he actually picked up an ax to kill his "stepfather." This matter caused an uproar in the city, and it is not known how it will end. After the incident, he was caught and taken to the Public Security Bureau, and also transferred to the law. Originally, it was a bloody case, how could it be dealt with vaguely? Alas! Unexpectedly, there is a very interesting wonderful passage in the back, writing it out, it is also in the unreasonable, there is an emotional meaning, see it in this case!</p>
<p>A Mr. Chen, created the disaster of killing his "stepfather"! The "stepfather" was bleeding from his head and was operated on in the hospital, his life could be saved. But the knife-wielding murderer could not but be locked up in the detention center. At this time, his mother could not help but cry, saying, "My son killed my husband, now my husband is not dead, but my son is in jail, not only can I not face my son, but how can I face my previous husband? My son was born to my previous husband, now the one he killed is not my son's father, alas! The blame is on me, but I love my son, and I can't help but love my husband." So, she asked someone to persuade the murdered person to withdraw the lawsuit, and at the same time, thought of rescuing the criminal from prison. In the past, she looked at her "stepfather" like a stranger, but now her daughter and daughter-in-law go to the hospital to comfort him morning and evening, and affectionately call him "Daddy." According to this, the "stepfather" took a few knives, and actually made the name of father, and Mr. Chen borrowed a knife to issue a marriage certificate on behalf of his mother, is this not a very funny news story?</p>

<p>The Twenty-first Chapter: Under the Lamp, Bitterly Instructing a Weak Daughter-in-law; Wandering Down the Mountain, Coldly Observing a Hero</p>
<p>As for the words about gender equality and freedom to make friends, it's ultimately not good. Making friends is a matter for men, managing household affairs is the duty of those inside the bedroom. What good does making friends do? If people say you like freedom, that's not good. If they don't say that, then it's hard to say. Ah..." Jiang's spoke for a while, loaded with veiled accusations and dragging her feet. Guizhi, because she herself felt guilty about what she had done, how could she not understand? Her face became even redder, and she just sat there with her head lowered, folding and unfolding the two small newspapers on the table. Jiang's then knew that her words had hit Guizhi's sore spot, so she stopped saying anything, picked up the fabric in her arms, and sewed a few more stitches. But she only sewed a few stitches, then put it down again, and continued to talk to herself, "It's not that I'm being nagging, raising a daughter is the most difficult thing these days. If you're too strict, people will say you're stubborn and old-fashioned. But then again, in these times, you have to be strict. But if you relax a little, who knows what kind of trouble will arise. People these days have poisonous tongues. If it gets out of hand, they'll even put you in the newspaper." These words were heavier than what she had said before, and Guizhi's face was even redder, as if it had been smeared with pig's blood, even her eyelids were red. The two earrings hanging from her ears were shaking uncertainly. Jiang's glanced at her out of the corner of her eye, but didn't say anything, and lowered her head to work again. After Guizhi received these two criticisms from her mother, she knew that they were directed at her, but if she didn't say anything, it would be like admitting to the accusation. Although her mother was not an outsider, she thought that if she silently acknowledged her mother's words, it would be as if she really had some illicit affair, and that would be an injustice! So she deliberately put on an angry look, pushed the newspaper forward, and suddenly stood up, saying, "Aren't you making a joke? Listening to your tone, it's as if I have some unacceptable thing that you've seen. Isn't this what people call gossiping about others' families? But you're gossiping about your own family."

<h3>New Year</h3>
<p>— Yu Yangling</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, many foreign men and women seen on Avenue Joffre were mostly merry. But there were also children who envied the toys in the splendid glass cabinets and refused to leave, only to be pulled away by their parents, and thus felt that the "universal celebration" was not yet here.</p>
<p>From the fact that foreigners celebrate Christmas like the Chinese celebrate the New Year, I thought about how we are also about to celebrate the New Year. But because I live in the city and am a bit older than a child, I no longer have much interest in celebrating the New Year. The most interesting New Year was always when I was a child living in the countryside.</p>
<p>There were so many things to do in the countryside. Starting from sending the Kitchen God to heaven on the twenty-third night, we entered the New Year holiday. From then on, the children had something to be merry about and something to eat every day, just without wearing new clothes. It was not the same for the adults. Although they also had something to be merry about and something to eat, in the days before the second New Year's Day, they still had to be busy and worried, especially on the last day of the year, collecting debts, paying debts, borrowing debts, and avoiding debts, it would always be noisy until three or four in the morning.</p>
<p>If it was a poor person who owed debts, then the last day of the year was an extremely difficult ordeal.</p>
<p>Scolding, beating, stripping clothes, robbing furniture... all kinds of shame and suffering were the homework that poor people could not escape on the last day of the year. They could only endure, endure until dawn.</p>
<p>Dawn was the first day of the New Year. However, strangely, the poor people who were scolded, beaten, stripped of their clothes, and had their furniture robbed because they could not repay their debts one or two hours ago, were now wearing a slightly less patched-up piece of clothing and going out, and there must be money hidden inside this piece of clothing, from several to dozens of yuan.</p>
<p>They took this money to gamble. Gambling was the only entertainment for poor people during the New Year, and for the first five days of the New Year, it was "imperial gambling," and no one would come to prohibit it. Taking advantage of this opportunity, they wanted to have as much fun as possible.</p>
<p>They didn't care about being scolded or beaten for not repaying debts, they didn't care about being stripped of their clothes or having their furniture robbed, they didn't even care about letting their wives and children go hungry, during the New Year season, the "gambling capital" had to be prepared no matter what.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to common sense, the poor people are really foolish and despicable.</p>
<p>However, the mood of the poor people who would rather suffer a little more of the usual hardships on the last day of the year in order to gamble for a few days of happiness in the year is not unimaginable. Everyone pursues happiness, [who differs in heart according to their poverty or success], but who can arrange things as comfortably as the rich?</p>
<p>However, the rich are always clever. They invented a method, which is to still collect debts on the morning of the first day of the New Year, but with lanterns lit, counting it as if the last day of the year had not yet passed, which did not violate the rules. But for the poor, it was a major misfortune.</p>
<p>What is said above is about celebrating the Lunar New Year, and may only be limited to my hometown. Since the Gregorian calendar was adopted, I don't know how the poor people in my hometown and other places are celebrating the New Year.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of [A History of Modern Chinese Literature]</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Recently, I bought Qian Jibo's [A History of Modern Chinese Literature]. However, the meaning of [modern] that Mr. Qian put on this book is different from ours, so the modern Chinese literature he is talking about is also different from ours. Opening the book, I saw his introduction. At the end of his introduction, he said, "Why not write Republic of China, but write modern? It is said that our Republic of China was created shallowly, and the writers who were temporarily promoted all had their heads exposed at the end of the late Qing Dynasty. Even the elders lived as if they didn't want to serve the orthodoxy of the Republic of China. How could one summarize it with the Republic of China! And another army was formed, rising after the founding of the Republic of China, only Zhang Shizhao's logic and Hu Shi's vernacular literature! Therefore, living in this world, talking about literature and only being limited to the Republic of China, this is a crime against literature!"</p>
<p>Originally, he titled the two words "modern" for the old remnants who [did not want to serve the Republic of China], and the literature he wanted to talk about was precisely the literature of this group of people. In the book, whenever he mentioned the Manchu Qing Dynasty, he called it [Late Qing], which was of course using the Spring and Autumn writing style used by historians since Confucius. As for his punctuation, he liked to use exclamation points, which was also of course the intention of Ouyang Gong's new Five Dynasties history, which liked to use [Alas]. Standing on this position, using this view, to look at modern Chinese literature, he naturally only saw the literature of the old remnants, and could not help but exclaim, "Living in this world, talking about literature and only being limited to the Republic of China, this is a crime against literature!"</p>
<p>Looking at the table of contents of this book again, the introduction and the beginning of the book, explaining literature, literary history, and the history of modern Chinese literature, generally discussing the changes in literature in the Middle Ages, occupy a total of forty pages. From the ancient literature in the upper volume to the so-called new literature [New People's Style] [Logical Essay] in the lower volume, it occupies 424 pages. When it comes to vernacular literature, from page 425 to page 449, there are only 29 pages. I thought that if he did not write this point about vernacular literature, wouldn't it be just right to title it "A History of Old Literature" or "Ancient Literature" of modern China? And there are already 424 pages, which is rich enough! If not, simply don't write the lower volume, and don't allow Liang Qichao's New People's Style and Zhang Shizhao's Logical Essay to be included in the book title and call it [A History of Modern Chinese Literature of the Old Generation] would be more appropriate. Although Zhang Taiyan is listed in it, it doesn't matter, because Mr. Zhang has already signed himself [Zhang Binglin, a remnant of the Republic of China] in a couplet to mourn Li Yuanhong. If the writing is for the sake of the pure and flawless style of this book, it is best to only write the upper volume, and kick Mr. Zhang away with one foot, and title it [A History of the Literature of the Late Qing Dynasty], wouldn't that be great? This old man is not smart, but wants to offer this humble opinion to the author Mr. Qian, I wonder what Mr. Qian thinks?</p>
<p>The modern Chinese vernacular literature seen by Mr. Qian has only one writer, Hu Shi, and only Zhou Shuren and Xu Zhimo are mentioned in the appendix, and only Guo Moruo, Yu Dafu, and Jiang Guangchi are mentioned by name.</p>
<p>After buying Qian's A Glimpse of a History of Modern Chinese Literature, I can't help but say a few words. After reading it through in the future, there may be a sequel.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on [Art] and [Artist]</h3>
<p>— Tang Jun</p>
<p>There are people who, relying on their [intuition], use the combination of colors, lines, tones, or gestures as tools to constantly and maximally express their [self] and unfold their [life]. The more harmonious the combination of these colors, lines, tones, or gestures, the more vivid their [self] appears, and the more meaningful their [life] unfolds. The more meaningful and powerful their life unfolds, the more profound the [traces] of those unfoldings become. The easier it is for people to feel these [traces]. These traces - paintings, sculptures...etc, people give them a special name, calling them [art]. The person who makes this [unfolding of life] and [expression of self] is called the [artist].</p>
<p>The so-called [art] and [artist], on the easy side, we have seen and heard many such names in the West, really as common as everyday meals. A [singer], an [actor], people call him [artist]. The [songs] and [scripts] that they sing and perform, people call them [works of art]. Works related to painting, sculpture, decorative arts, etc., are also called [art], and the people who create these works are also called [artists]. Western Europeans in general do not have a more special concept of this name than other names. In China, it is not the same. People with [long hair] and [large bow ties] seem to feel that they are not enough to express that they are [artists]. Their desire to obtain the title of [artist] is more important than anything else. Hearing people call him [artist] is more glorious than anything else. These are all [morbid] manifestations of a nation with unhealthy [aesthetic consciousness] and a country with backward art.</p>
<p>On the difficult side, a work that has no [life], no [self], and expresses no power, although it is called [art] in name, has no artistic value in [content]. A person whose life is extremely ordinary, or who uses colors, lines, etc. to spend his life on a very ordinary path, although he has a large bow tie, long hair, and the [form] of an artist, has no [substance] of an artist.</p>
<p>Of course, riding in a car, living in a big house, taking concubines, being a military officer, and always having several soldiers with pistols following behind, these, in the minds of ordinary people, always seem to be a very meaningful life, but in the eyes of [artists], they are not worth looking at. On the other hand, the life of a savage on a desert island, living with savages, and playing with deer, has cast Gauguin's great [artistic life], has cast Gauguin's great [art], has cast Gauguin as such a great [artist]!</p>
<h3>Small Notes from a Guest Window</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>[You Zhengwei's Letters], three volumes, written by the Qing poet Wu Xiqi, contains two hundred and twenty letters, which can be said to be quite a lot in terms of quantity, but reading them is quite disappointing. Except for the early works in the first volume, they are all social articles and correspondence. Early letters are not large in quantity, but they are rich in authenticity, allowing readers to see his life, thoughts, and environment. In a letter to Jian Baogu, he said [We are extremely distressed people]. His early life was indeed like this. Xiqi replied to Xu Tieyai's letter, saying [The west wind is gradually cold, and all my cotton clothes are in pawn, I hope for some moisture to revive the difficulty]. He said to his younger brother Ruoyu, [The previous debt has not been paid off, and the later debt is coming again, I really don't know when I will be able to jump out of this troubled world]. He sent a letter to Yang Jintang, saying [My situation is that I am being tortured in bitterness every day... I want to return to sweetness, but I can't get it. The population in the family is gradually increasing, and the house is almost breaking. My sister's prospects are also declining day by day, and I have to cook without rice every morning]. The state of poverty can be seen most clearly in these letters. And this period of life is also the most unforgettable for him, so there is still such a memory in his later hand-written notes [It is not easy to live in Chang'an, and there are eight mouths to feed, with a hot pot on top of my head, I really don't know what to do]. (Sent to Zhao Caichen)</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (7)(5)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Mother Roland asked:</p>
<p>"Has Pierre not come down?"</p>
<p>Her husband shrugged his shoulders and replied:</p>
<p>"No, let him be. He's always late. We can eat first."</p>
<p>She turned to Jean and said:</p>
<p>"You should go call him, my child. He'll be angry if we don't wait for him."</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom, I'll go."</p>
<p>So the young man ran out.</p>
<p>He went upstairs with the fervent determination of a timid person going into a fight.</p>
<p>When he knocked on the door, Pierre replied:</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>He entered.</p>
<p>The other was bent over the table writing.</p>
<p>"Good morning," Jean said.</p>
<p>Pierre stood up.</p>
<p>"Good morning."</p>
<p>So they shook hands as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>"Aren't you coming down for breakfast?"</p>
<p>"But... because... I have a lot to do."</p>
<p>The older brother's voice trembled, his uneasy eyes seeming to ask what he should do.</p>
<p>"Everyone's waiting for you."</p>
<p>"Ah! Is... is our mother downstairs?"</p>
<p>"Downstairs, and she's the one who asked me to call you."</p>
<p>"Ah! Then... I'll go down."</p>
<p>Outside the dining room door, he hesitated, unwilling to enter first. Then, with a sudden gesture, he opened the door. He saw his father and mother sitting opposite each other across the dining table.</p>
<p>He looked at the ground and silently walked up to her. Like recently, he didn't kiss her cheeks but only bent down to offer his forehead for her to kiss. He guessed her mouth was near, but he didn't feel her lips touch his skin at all. He straightened up, his heart pounding after this pretense of affection.</p>
<p>He thought, "What did they say after I left last night?"</p>
<p>Jean constantly called out softly, "Mother," "Dear Mother," paying attention to her, serving her, pouring her drinks. Pierre then understood that they had cried together, but he couldn't penetrate their thoughts! Did Jean think his mother was guilty, or did he think his brother was despicable?</p>

<h3>How to Utilize Spare Time?</h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>With the development of the economic panic, the working hours of general occupational sectors are increasing day by day, so-called spare time is actually very little. Precisely because this time is very little, it is especially precious, and the handling of this precious time has become a very important issue.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all people in work are immersed in hard, monotonous, and dry work every day, without any pleasure. Therefore, after finishing work, they will try their best to pursue entertainment, especially low-level entertainment, and waste a little precious time in playing mahjong, amusement parks, listening to storytelling, watching plays... and other low-level entertainment.</p>
<p>However, these low-level entertainments are the most likely to consume money and damage the spirit, and the most likely to make people increasingly degenerate. It is indeed a pity to waste a little precious spare time in such entertainment! Of course, we are tired all day long, and after work, we should find a little happiness to regulate this tired and dry life. But finding happiness does not necessarily mean indulging or being anesthetized in low-level entertainment, which is absolutely harmful to one's own spirit, one's future, and everything. In our spare time, we should look for more noble entertainment, that is, entertainment that does not harm our body and spirit, does not waste money, and can increase our knowledge. Under this principle, I hope that people of various occupations will properly improve their respective clubs and their family lives. At the same time, I also hope that the advanced members of the general society will pay attention to the issue of general entertainment, strive to promote relatively noble entertainment, and guide the lives of general workers. Our [Amateur Weekly] should especially bear a particularly important responsibility on this issue. In this way, it will not only be of great benefit to workers, clerks, teachers, ... all working people, but also of great benefit to the entire society.</p>
<p>However, I think the best thing to do in spare time is to read books and newspapers. This can increase our knowledge and is of great importance to society and to the individual's profession. Here, I think that the [Amateur Correspondence Reading Club] advocated by Mr. Xiaojie in the last issue of this magazine has a very important significance. If there is an opportunity in the future, I also plan to express some specific opinions on this.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Environment and People</h3>
<p>— A Er</p>
<p>Trainee</p>
<p>We two are sitting at the same desk, facing each other. But we are completely two people, two people who are different in everything...temperament, consciousness, work performance...are all different. We grew up in two different environments. Colorful environments create colorful people.</p>
<p>Originally, two people who are different in everything are not easy to stay together for a long time, and we will certainly be unable to avoid this, if not for the work we are doing together that connects us. In any case, that is only our superficial cooperation.</p>
<p>We both are trainees in the accounting department, doing the preliminary work in the accounting department...collecting invoices, sorting invoices, stapling invoices. I came in a few months earlier than him, so I know a little more. I told him everything I knew, but he was very casual about it.</p>
<p>Having money at home means that everything can be sloppy. This is the general opinion of young masters. He is a young master, so he agrees with this. He always runs in and out sitting in his shiny chartered car, which makes the wretched director who earns two or three hundred yuan a month and has to support a family of nine in Shanghai, and also has to maintain appearances, feel jealous. When he eats lunch, he complains that the food in the office is not good (that's two yuan a table, and I think that's already amazing!), so he adds an extra yuan every day. He has his hair permed once a week, BIGWAVE, which costs ten dimes each time. But he only has twenty old yuan a month (he doesn't care about this, and he once told me...he would rather not take a salary and be a dry clerk!). The wages he pays his driver every month are not enough! In addition, he often goes to the movies, no matter the size of the theater, if there is any [artistic] film or [nude beauty] dance, he is sure to go, no matter how far the theater is from his home.</p>
<p>In the eyes of rich fathers, a son like this is not considered too bad. He obeyed his father and married a wife chosen for him by his father when he was eighteen, and this year he had a daughter. (He is only twenty-one years old now!) Moreover, he denies some rich people's three major principles: no gambling, no prostitution, no opium. Just watching movies won't use up a mountain of wealth.</p>
<p>There are many people like him in Shanghai! I am the exact opposite of him. I am two years younger than him. I have a passionate and upward heart. The environment has made my form middle-aged. I understand that I should work, and my work performance must at least be balanced with the remuneration I receive (fifteen yuan). I think we must be the vanguard of the twentieth century and must not indulge in excessive enjoyment and luxury. In fact, I often cannot even satisfy the desire to buy a daily necessity. But I don't ask for it, I always think that there are still many poor people being trampled under our feet! (That is why I especially sympathize with the tea boys and old stewards in the office.) They began their training in hard labor while we had the privilege of going to paradise schools to study. This is certainly the failure of the old social system, but we cannot escape a part of the responsibility.</p>
<p>Because this young master does not feel any interest in the work and this work is not done by him alone, I always say to him with a smile...[Mr. Zhou, why don't you rest at home, why do you come here to do this kind of work?]</p>
<p>[ ! This kind of work is really annoying!]</p>
<p>He says this kind of work is annoying, but who knows that he has this attitude towards any kind of work? To be honest, I have never seen him be interested in a job. I think he must be prepared to live like this, all the way to the grave.</p>
<p>But, there are many powerful unemployed people crying out!</p>
<p>One Copper Coin Per Person</p>
<h3>Two People Cooperate</h3>
<p>— Yuan Xifu</p>
<p>Three Tenants</p>
<p>The cost of living in Shanghai is so high that I can't afford to live in a house alone, so I have to live in the back upstairs of a family with Mr. Huang from X University.</p>
<p>The cold wind was roaring on the horse sleep, the streetlights emitted a dim and yellow light, I felt a little cold, and after eating dinner in a small [basic goods] restaurant, I wanted to return to my room to read a book. There was no electric light on the stairs, and when I walked up, it was so dark that my tongue stuck out and couldn't find my mouth. After a long time, I touched the kerosene lamp that emitted light and accompanied me in the deep night, but for some reason, I struck seven or eight matches and it still didn't light. Using the short-term light of the matches, I saw that there was still half a lamp of oil. [There is oil, why doesn't it light?] I guessed to myself... [Maybe it's because of the lamp wick.] Another question popped up in my mind.</p>
<p>I had decided to buy a lamp wick to replace it, but when I touched the copper coins in my pocket, there was only one. A god of terror seemed to stand in front of my darkness, laughing at me. [What to do tonight? The landlord has gone out, and Mr. Huang has not yet returned. Sleep? I am unwilling to waste good time.] This kind of doubtful question was moving in my brain like an electric current.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps on the stairs broke the silence in the room. I knew Huang had returned.</p>
<p>[Has the fire not been lit yet?] He asked this question as soon as he was halfway up the stairs.</p>
<p>[A lamp wick is broken, and I don't have money to buy it. I have to wait for you to come back!]</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>[Don't you have even three copper coins? I only have one copper coin in my pocket.] He said slowly.</p>
<p>[I only have one in my pocket too.] I handed him a copper coin.</p>
<p>The two of us were silent for a while. Huang took the two copper coins and groped his way down the stairs. I sat silently on my bed, praying like a congregation in a church, hoping that God would forgive my sins.</p>
<p>After about twenty minutes, footsteps sounded on the stairs again. [I've bought it.] This was Huang's voice. When I heard the words [bought it], I jumped up as happily as a child getting a toy they had never seen before.</p>
<p>Relying on the short-term light of the match again, I replaced the new wick, and the dark little room was lit up again.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Research</p>
<h3>The Headliner of the 1933 International Stage</h3>
<p>— Di Lai</p>
<p>One of the most serious problems currently at the end of 1933 is the question of whether the League of Nations exists or not. This question has formed two camps, one supporting the League of Nations and the other reorganizing the League of Nations. The former is represented by Britain and France and their satellites, and the latter is represented by Italy, Germany, and their fellow travelers. It has become the center of European diplomatic struggles. London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin are stirring up huge waves.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is a beautiful term. What do the Chinese think of it? As long as we recall how the League of Nations handled the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces after September 18, we probably don't need to waste any more words! It was established in February 1919, after the Paris Spoils Conference. It was an organization led by Britain and France, with the participation of imperialist countries such as Italy and Japan, to carve up small and weak national colonies and suppress revolutions. However, it hung up a sign that [guaranteed international peace and protected labor] at its front door.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, it has naturally fulfilled many of its historical missions, but it has not eased the contradictions between imperialist countries in any way. This political trust is changing and tending to shake with the contrast of economic and political forces between world imperialist countries, and it is reaching old age. After September 18, its inability to impose forceful sanctions on the destroyers of peace was already nakedly exposing its incompetence and deception to the public, and it had declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In this year when the world is comprehensively falling into a deeper economic panic and political crisis, the contradictions of capitalism and the opposition of imperialist countries have reached the point where they must be resolved by war. Old organizations need to be disbanded. Naturally, a comedy of support and overthrow must emerge from this decomposition.</p>
<p>The disintegration of the League of Nations was first due to Japan's withdrawal from the international community, and the League of Nations could do nothing about it. Now that the German fascists want to obtain the freedom of military adventure, they have also withdrawn from the League of Nations, and the League of Nations is equally unable to cope, and can only reduce its scope. This proves that the League of Nations has completely collapsed, and all activities based on the Geneva mechanism have completely disappeared in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p>Now the new force that has emerged is Fascist Italy, which is actively demanding the reorganization of the League of Nations, and Germany naturally holds the same view. Italy and Germany's opposition to the Versailles system is rooted in reason. Germany is the so-called victimized country, and Italy has not achieved a leading position in this. Italy is now demanding leadership in Europe. Germany has to strengthen its domestic dignity by means of adventurous foreign policies. Opposing the Treaty of Versailles and demanding equality in disarmament are the most pleasant demands. Using this as a threat to withdraw from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference is easy to dispel public dissatisfaction, dilute the tense emotions, and shift public attention. This is the basis of fascist diplomacy.</p>
<p>Italy and Germany are naturally the leaders of this camp. They want to smash this organization and change the division of European forces. They are waiting for war.</p>
<p>On the side of Britain and France, they are naturally not truly loving peace. It is just that they are unwilling to easily give up this established dominant force. Now they are coming out to defend the League of Nations, but it is just to prolong the time for everyone to prepare for war, and it may not be helpful to [world peace].</p>
<p>If we observe the comings and goings and collusion in Paris, France, the active communication with satellites, and the strengthening of their own forces, as well as the fervent discussions in London about the League of Nations and disarmament issues, with politicians, military experts, and pastors participating in the discussions, the scene is like the time when the Great War was about to begin in 1914, we can imagine that they are not afraid of war, they are also preparing for war, but they want to use the guise of the League of Nations to better sway in front of the public, and it is more conducive to their own preparation for war (although this war is actively opposed by the public), and to obtain a more superior position in wartime in order to defeat the enemy.</p>
<h3>Slowdown</h3>
<p>— Chun Sheng</p>
<p>Streetwalker</p>
<p>In the weather of October, even in the temperate Eastern metropolis, the wind blowing on the body is strong enough. In the deep night, the wind blew even harder, tearing down the withered leaves on the trees on both sides of the road, blowing up the cheongsams of the goddesses standing on both sides of the road, and piercing the hearts of all the poor. This is a sharp knife of nature!</p>
<p>There are countless stars in the deep blue sky and sea, winking their eyebrows, as if also satirizing and mocking the contradictions of this metropolis. In the middle of the road, cars were constantly running one after another, with fat-bellied men and petite women sitting leisurely in the carriages, seeking their stimulation in large theaters, nightclubs, and dance halls. A group of people were active under the three major companies and the Great World. They seemed not to know that they should rest at night. Their faces were covered with a thick layer of powder, their cheeks and lips were smeared with red rouge, and they smelled of inferior viewing water. There were old women with wrinkles all over their foreheads and young girls who had not yet fully developed. They were densely and tightly squeezed on both sides of the road, reaching out their hands to grab one or two workers, students, or country bumpkins, and exchange their bodies for living materials. Perhaps because of the tight wind and the thin clothes on their bodies, their upper and lower teeth were hitting each other, their bodies were shivering, and their legs were shaking like ghosts.</p>
<p>Gui, she had not been doing this kind of life for long. Having endured the coercion of the knife-like wind and the whip-like gaze of the procuress, she was in so much pain that she wanted to cry, and warm memories slowly climbed into her heart.</p>
<p>It was also such a quiet silver night, and the strength of the wind was not worse than today, but she didn't feel cold. Her mother was sewing clothes under the dim yellow light, and my sister and I were playing hide-and-seek in the courtyard...</p>
<p>In front of her, the towering buildings and flashing red lights and the noise of the metropolis disappeared. The dim yellow light, her mother's kind face, her brother's mischief, the narrow courtyard paved with gravel... all these lovely memories were like little waves jumping in her mind, warming her heart, and she fell into contemplation.</p>
<p>[Pig ! Do you want to eat a living? People ran past you and you didn't see it!]</p>
<p>Please pay attention to unemployed friends</p>
<p>Our company is now planning to hire a junior Japanese teacher, regardless of gender, and the teaching time is not limited. Bai Erbu Road Taihe Lane No. 21</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year</h3>
<p>— Qin Youheng</p>
<p>Uncle Genshou came back and said, "People in the city are busy celebrating the New Year."</p>
<p>"New Year!" Lizhen was washing clothes in the hall. Hearing her father say this, she turned around in astonishment. "Today is only November 14th."</p>
<p>"How do you know if you're huddled at home? They're following foreign days outside." Uncle Genshou bent down to take off his straw sandals, which were covered in mud.</p>
<p>"What foreign days? Isn't that what the teacher in the foreign school said about the solar calendar?" Lizhen asked.</p>
<p>Uncle Genshou put down the trouser legs rolled up on his knees, wiped his mouth, and said, "What isn't? Damn it, country people suffer. Originally, it wouldn't be too late to pay the rent for rice at this time, but if they change this day, they'll roll their eyes and say it's overdue. Originally..."</p>
<p>Lizhen knew that her father had suffered again and returned. She went to the room behind the fence to get the water pipe. Unfortunately, there wasn't a single layer of water smoke, and she ran out empty-handed.</p>
<p>"Dad, didn't you bring back some water smoke when you went to the city?"</p>
<p>"I thought about it, but the shipping costs have increased and I'm afraid the travel expenses won't be enough. Fortunately, I don't want to smoke when I'm annoyed. Lizhen, this anger is really hard to bear. That guy who pestered you last time and was scolded away can't get along with me. He loudly told me to give up the field and let someone else plant it."</p>
<p>"Um, is that the one wearing the diagonal vest, the deputy bookkeeper of the Qin family?"</p>
<p>"That's him."</p>
<p>"It's better not to argue with him too much. I heard that he is Mrs. Qin's godson. What if he really takes the field?" Lizhen wiped the soap foam piled on her arm on the edge of the foot basin.</p>
<p>"Giving in to others is not something I can do, even if it means losing my head. They are happy, slaughtering pigs and sheep to celebrate the New Year. What do we get after working a season?"</p>
<p>"But we want to celebrate the Chinese New Year." Lizhen said coquettishly.</p>
<p>"No matter what year you celebrate, you have to have money. Like your mother helping people outside, the money she earns back home month after month is only enough to pay the interest. It's a pity that she's outside, but her heart is hanging at home, and she can't bear to part with you. The day before yesterday, she picked up a pair of broken socks while taking out the garbage, washed them clean, and told me to bring them to you to wear for the New Year."</p>
<p>As Uncle Genshou spoke, he took out a paper package from his arms and handed it to Lizhen.</p>
<p>Lizhen took it. "Will Mom come back for the New Year?"</p>
<p>Uncle Genshou's face sank. "I don't think she'll come back. She has to help the master's family with the New Year's affairs."</p>
<p>"Didn't you just say that people in the city celebrate the foreign New Year?"</p>
<p>"Alas, for people with money, every day is like the New Year. They wear good clothes and eat fatty food. What's the big deal with celebrating two New Years? Anyway, they like to make noise and have fun." As Uncle Genshou said this, the township chief sent someone to call him to apportion the river dredging donation.</p>
<p>Lizhen stared blankly at the paper package, and the kind face of her mother vaguely appeared before her eyes. But, mother, mother is helping her master's family celebrate the New Year.</p>
<p>The hall was still a deathly silent hall.</p>

<h3>Child Gentlemen and Child Stars</h3>
<p>— Metaphor for Young Children</p>
<p>Shanxi Fenyang Communication</p>
<p>Dear readers, in this extraordinary state of rural organization faltering and the economy on the verge of collapse, allow me to tell you about the state of rural children's education.</p>
<p>There are two places where rural children study and receive education: one is the private school in the village, and the other is the so-called "foreign school" in the town. I really don't understand why the villagers still call textbooks "foreign books" and county-run schools "foreign schools." And those teachers responsible for rural education are so muddleheaded that they let them call it that, filling the air with "foreign" sounds. Dear readers, who do you think is to blame?</p>
<p>However, there's no need to waste words on this. Now, let's talk about the reality of these two children's education institutions. Most private schools are set up in the gloomy ancestral halls. Families with children in the village pool together ten or twenty dollars and invite an old scholar from the late Qing dynasty to lock up a group of innocent and lively children, accompanying the teacher in a life sentence-like ordeal. Imagine how those wild horse-like children can endure this invisible shackle. The one-foot-long, one-and-a-half inch wide, two-tenths of an inch thick bamboo ruler on the teacher's desk is enough to scare them silly.</p>
<p>Often, a very active child becomes dull and wooden after entering a private school. The old scholar only believes in the principle of "enduring hardship to become a superior person," and scolds the children with an iron face all day long. How can he care whether the children's nature and nerves can withstand this sudden oppression and restraint?</p>
<p>There's also a joke: the child from Third Uncle's family, who is nine years old this year, can recite a "Three Character Classic" fluently. But when I wrote the character "善" (shan, good) from "性本善" (xing ben shan, human nature is good) on a piece of paper for him to recognize, he stared blankly and couldn't answer. This shows that studying in a private school is just rote memorization. The children fear the teacher's ruler, so they have to memorize to avoid getting hit on the palm. This kind of overly strict private school education is really not suitable for young rural children.</p>
<p>However, what about the schools? What are they like?</p>
<p>You may have seen the schools in the towns. That kind of crude and makeshift organization, those teachers who hold their positions without contributing (very few are truly responsible), that kind of laissez-faire education is not necessarily more optimistic than private schools. The day before yesterday afternoon, my younger brother Shenze invited me to go to town to play and visit the XX County Junior Primary School. It was really ridiculous. The teacher was blowing a whistle and teaching the children to sing "Meng Jiangnu Searching for Her Husband." I heard that they spend half the day on the playground (courtyard) and the other half on singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Dear readers, don't think I'm exaggerating. Aunt's son Zhendi is also studying there. He's been studying for two years and has just finished a primer. But his singing and dancing skills are indeed very impressive.</p>
<p>What good does this kind of laissez-faire education do for rural children?</p>
<p>In my opinion, rural children's education should not be too strict or too lenient. It's best to have a balance of strictness and leniency. At the same time, we shouldn't constantly introduce the various luxuries and pleasures of the city to them. We should always point out the position of farmers in society and the reasons why the countryside is in such a bad state. But these words shouldn't be spoken with the face of a "teacher." They should be phrased more subtly.</p>
<p>However, in a situation where the national political system is not on track, and on the one hand, we are busy with "internal pacification and external resistance," it is a common and inevitable trend that primary school teachers in the countryside cannot receive their salaries, and children in the countryside cannot receive a good education!</p>

<h3>What is the Most Useful Knowledge?</h3>
<p>— Ms. Song Lingyi</p>
<p>"To learn is to apply," although this is an ancient Chinese proverb, it has not lost its absolute correctness even now. People who study medicine and engineering naturally do so for "application." Those who study politics, law, philosophy, and literature are also inseparable from the word "application." Whether Watt invented the steam engine for "application" when he invented it doesn't matter, but it was ultimately "used" by the so-called "civilized society" of modern times. The Christian doctrine of "universal love" seems fair on the surface, but it has been "used" by imperialism. In short, no matter what knowledge, no matter what you learn, you can't leave the word "application." "To learn is to apply" is indeed a true and undeniable truth.</p>
<p>However, what is manifested in China today is either "learning without application" or "learning something different from what is applied." Generally, people with knowledge and talent don't have the opportunity to "apply" it. People who study science and engineering become political committee members. People who study medicine and agriculture become company accountants or tax office clerks. These are common phenomena in Chinese society today. Therefore, some sensitive people think that the saying "to learn is to apply" is wrong and that to learn true knowledge, one should break away from this useless word "application." Thus, the theories of "learning for the sake of learning" and "reading for the sake of reading" have been advocated.</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called phenomena of "learning without application" and "learning something different from what is applied" that are currently appearing are products of a deformed Chinese society. The fact that people who study science don't have the opportunity to use their scientific talents proves that the deformed Chinese society rejects science. This is not because the theory of "to learn is to apply" is wrong, but because there is a problem with Chinese society. In order to solve the problems of Chinese society, there is a greater need for knowledge that can solve these problems. If we ignore this and advocate "learning for the sake of learning" and "reading for the sake of reading," it will only prolong this deformed Chinese society, and the phenomena of "learning without application" and "learning something different from what is applied" produced by this society will become even more widespread. As for what "true" knowledge is, it will certainly not be produced, because knowledge is social, not super-social. The deformed Chinese society of today can never accommodate "true" knowledge. What it accommodates is only unhealthy and base knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore, under the current circumstances, what we need to learn is not only the knowledge that is "useful," but also the knowledge that is the most "useful," which is the knowledge that can solve all the problems produced by the deformed Chinese society.</p>
<p>What kind of knowledge can solve the problems that are currently occurring in Chinese society? I don't have any specific opinions here. I only say that to solve all the problems of Chinese society, one must understand the actual economic and political situation in China. Therefore, those who seek the most useful knowledge must participate in all social movements and understand all social situations. The so-called methods of "reading behind closed doors" and "not discussing state affairs" are really concrete manifestations of a policy of fooling the people. As long as one is not willing to be manipulated by this policy, one will inevitably link theory with practice and strive to seek the most useful knowledge in light of the actual situation of Chinese society today.</p>

<h3>Long-Term Trial</h3>
<p>— Guan Ying</p>
<p>The Office</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to the blessings of heaven, I finally found a position with my own pen in the midst of the thousands of unemployed people. I have been working for three or four months now, and it's even in a company office! Speaking of offices, they are also divided into many levels. Some are magnificent foreign houses, and some only rent a room. The staff inside, some earn hundreds of taels a month, which is very common, while others earn at most ten dollars a month, which is not even as good as a doorman. The office where I work is in a corner on the second floor of an old foreign house that is at least half a century old. The staircase is as dark as night even in the daytime, and there isn't even a street light. When going up and down, one has to be careful to avoid falling. Two dimly lit inner rooms are where we work. However, although the place is small, its function is great. As long as you count the signs on the wall when you enter, there are at least ten or twenty of them, such as XX Association, XX Society, XX Hall, which will make you confused about what kind of organization it is.</p>
<p>I remember it was when summer was turning to autumn when I was looking for a job. Suddenly, I received a reply to my unsolicited application, asking me to discuss everything in person.</p>
<p>How happy I was at that time! I went to XX Company—the company I now work for—with the letter that I had obtained like a treasure, to meet the manager. After an interview, he was satisfied with me and asked me to start by handling documents. The trial period was three months, with a monthly allowance of ten dollars for transportation. After the trial period, if I was suitable, my monthly salary would start at twenty-five dollars, and the trial period could be shortened. Although I thought the salary was too low at the time and not enough to cover the minimum cost of living, I was willing to do it with peace of mind because the prospects were good. When I first started, I was indeed only doing document work. I had to write at least dozens of letters every day. Fortunately, I had some training in writing, so I was able to handle it with ease. Later, I don't know how they found out that I also knew a little about accounting, so they slowly assigned me most of the accounting books. I thought that during the trial period, I might as well show off my skills, so I was happy to do my best. But, this way, it was terrible! From morning to night, except for a moment of leisure during meals, I was burying myself in my desk, working non-stop.</p>
<p>One month, two months... Time flew by like a galloping horse. This heavy work had worn me out. My glimmer of hope was tied to the formal employment after the trial period! The salary increase issue. This was my only hope and comfort. I had publicly expressed it in conversations with friends and in letters I sent back home. They were all envious and looking forward to my bright future and stable life. I was also confident that my performance during the trial period was not bad, and that this goal could be achieved.</p>
<p>At the end of the third month, he didn't say a word to me. Of course, I continued to work, thinking that not being fired meant I was suitable. Since I was formally employed, the minimum salary—twenty-five dollars—was definitely mine. I was happy, I was excited, and another month passed quickly. One day, just as I was about to leave the office, the manager called me over. I knew it was time to get paid, and my heart was pounding. As soon as we met, he first said a lot about how sluggish business was, and finally added, "I can only pay you this amount." As he spoke, he handed over two five-dollar bills and two white-silver Yuan coins. When I heard these words and saw this amount, I felt like I had been electrocuted, numb. I wanted to say something, but he had already stood up to answer the phone. My God! What to say? What's the use of saying anything? Unless you quit. If you don't quit, in this depressed year, there are many people who are willing to sell themselves cheap.</p>
<p>I took the twelve-dollar salary and walked out of the company gate. The city's torches illuminated the darkness. The cold wind of the night slapped my face like a knife, filled with endless threats. The dream of hope had been shattered.</p>

<p>Occupational Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Self-Esteem and Occupation</h3>
<p>— Xing Jian</p>
<p>Here are two positions: one is the so-called quasi-voluntary teacher that is often advertised in newspapers, with a monthly allowance of eight dollars for transportation and accommodation at one's own expense; the other is a tea server, with a monthly salary of fifteen dollars, including food and lodging. I think that except for those who are illiterate and can only be tea servers, anyone who has studied for a few years and is qualified to be a teacher would definitely choose the first position. Money is something that everyone only complains about being too little, not too much, especially those unemployed people who can use an extra copper coin to solve an already meager living (of course, there are some exceptions, but I think most are like this). But why do they prefer to choose the first position with a lower salary and poorer treatment? In a word, it is "self-esteem" that is at work. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>I have a friend who graduated from middle school. Because of financial problems, he couldn't afford to pursue further education and had to wait at home for the opportunity to enter society. Although his knowledge is not bad, first, he lacks recommendations, and second, he is full of history, geography, geometry, and trigonometry, and has almost no business experience. One year, two years, slipped by in the blink of an eye, and he was still sitting at home as a parasite. Once, because he couldn't bear the pressure of life, it just so happened that a relative said he would introduce him to a store department to be a trainee. He went there with a thick skin (as he himself said) and came back after three days, saying he wouldn't do it anymore. He said angrily, "[...] In addition to the physical labor of being busy from seven o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night, almost without time to eat or relieve himself, he also had to watch the faces of the senior staff. For me, a respectable (?) middle school graduate, to do this menial work and have to put up with bad temper, I would rather tighten my belt and starve to death than do it [...]." When I heard this, apart from sighing helplessly, I felt that his self-esteem was at play.</p>
<p>Another friend who didn't graduate from middle school also wanted to enter society due to economic pressure. But there were always a few people with the same knowledge and situation as him that could be found everywhere in society. Although he tried his best and spent a lot of hard-earned postage, three years passed in the blink of an eye, and he still couldn't grab a broken job. A friend of his knew two bosses who sold English newspapers wholesale. According to the boss, he sold the newspapers to the hawkers for eight cents, and the hawkers could sell them for ten cents, earning two cents per copy. If they could sell forty copies a day (which is the most common sales volume), they would have eight jiao of income. Also, Westerners often give two jiao without asking for change, which is "extra money." So, making a dollar or more a day is very common. His friend wanted to introduce him to try selling newspapers, but he declined because he didn't want to embarrass his father. But no matter what, I think the motivation for his refusal had some element of self-esteem mixed in.</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of unemployed people are stretching out their hands to society for bread, and many, many unemployed people are committing suicide due to economic pressure. Although most of it is due to the economic recession, I dare to assert that a lot of the responsibility should be borne by self-esteem.</p>
<p>Finally, we shout out loud:</p>
<p>[Earning a living by labor is the same as earning a living by knowledge. It is not embarrassing, let alone a disgrace.</p>
<p>Down with the ethereal, harmful, and useless self-esteem!]</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>— Qiu Yiqin</p>
<p>I have been looking for work for four months, which adds up to more than two hundred days. Even now, I haven't even seen a glimmer of hope! Although the extremely serious life of [hunger and cold] is still pressing me tightly.</p>
<p>I accidentally looked in the mirror, which couldn't help but make me extremely angry and sad. From my small and dark eyes, it fully shows that I am already exhausted. A yellow-black face as gloomy as a wax museum model naturally doesn't have a trace of a smile. Below the unkempt and greasy hair is my mouth, which needs a lot of bread stuffed into it every day. Besides, I have nothing! To be precise... I am just a breathing skeleton and a blood-and-tears-soaked zombie!</p>
<p>Of course, if it weren't for the struggle for this miserable [life], who in this world would be willing to linger forever? After I have endured the [scorn], [ridicule], [insult], [pain] of life!</p>
<p>In the past, I had bravely wanted to kill my future from the hail of bullets. So, I generously drove my whole body and child consciousness into the generally disciplined army life. But I didn't... In several charges, I didn't expose my bones to the sand and gravel to be a loyal and righteous wronged soul! When I quietly crawled up from the extremely tired and bloody ground, I looked around at my surroundings, which were filled with no breath of life. I was at a loss as to who I was fighting for? Who was I sacrificing for? Not only did I not find the future I was looking for here, but because several dear brothers in arms had died one after another, it further increased my infinitely deep sorrow, so I returned to my hometown in dismay!</p>
<p>In order to live to survive, I have to find bread myself, once or twice, and now it seems that I am exhausted and dull. [Hunger] and [cold] drive me to beg the gentlemen of this newspaper. If there is still a bit of compassionate sympathy in this world, at least I believe I will not be completely desperate. Although I don't have any special skills, I have also done many times the work of saving members, librarians, reporters, and painters. I am now in urgent need of work similar to the above to exchange for my minimum price. Correspondence to this publication.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Research</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Improving Chinese Bookkeeping</h3>
<p>— Ju Fu</p>
<p>Improving Chinese bookkeeping has been heavily promoted. I studied accounting, bookkeeping, and other subjects in school, and my current job is as an accountant, so I naturally pay attention to this matter. Now, I will briefly write down what I have learned from this research.</p>
<p>First, there is the problem of separating the columns for the number of amounts. The amount columns of double-entry bookkeeping clearly separate the columns for ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, yuan, jiao, and fen, etc., and the columns between thousands and hundreds are separated by a dark blue line, and the columns between yuan and jiao are separated by a red line to show conspicuousness. Now, the amount columns of improved Chinese bookkeeping are not clearly separated, and they are the same as those that are not improved. In this way, one ten thousand yuan and one hundred yuan both have three characters, and five yuan and five fen both have two characters. How can this be clear at a glance? It does not meet the purpose of accounting to be clear! If we can print lines and separate the columns according to double-entry bookkeeping, then one ten thousand yuan, including two decimal places, occupies seven spaces, one hundred yuan, including two decimal places, occupies five spaces, and these five spaces are all after the dark blue line. Five yuan, including two decimal places, occupies three spaces, and five fen occupies one space, and this space is after the red line. With the above method of recording, the numbers have different lengths and different positions, so of course it is clear at a glance to know their size, and there will be no confusion. The amount is the most important part of the ledger. Since it is called improvement, this point should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Second, there is the issue of horizontal and vertical formats. Vertical format must use vertical paper, and vertical paper should not be too long, which is not convenient for setting up multiple amount columns. Horizontal format can adopt the multi-column accounting method. The multi-column accounting method is very convenient and has the functions of differentiation and aggregation. Because the multi-column accounting method is to collect all accounts in one ledger, the entire record is in sight. Both recording and checking accounts can avoid turning over and checking here and there, which can avoid a lot of trouble, save a lot of time, and reduce a lot of mental effort. Moreover, collecting all accounts in one ledger will of course use fewer books. If you use a vertical format, it will be counterproductive! Therefore, this point is worth discussing, and we must not think that the system passed down for thousands of years is the most precious and supreme national essence!</p>
<p>Third, there is the question of what kind of numerals to use for accounting. Everyone knows that Arabic numerals have been used by all countries in the world. Even in our country, from university professors to male and female workers, everyone knows them. Now, house numbers, cars, and other numbers are also used, which shows that Arabic numerals are already very common in China. Moreover, schools across the country, from primary schools, order children to learn Arabic numerals. In the future, Arabic numerals in China will undoubtedly be adopted everywhere, just like in other countries in the world. Therefore, I think that Arabic numerals should be used for accounting. Arabic numerals are suitable for horizontal writing, which shows that horizontal bookkeeping is suitable for adoption. In fact, our people can be said to be accustomed to looking at numbers horizontally, because the numbers represented by the abacus, which has been used by the business community for thousands of years, are arranged in the same way as Arabic numerals, which is completely horizontal.</p>
<p>Someone said, "[According to your proposal, then what about writing with a brush? What about writing with a fountain pen? What about using foreign paper? What about using domestic paper?]" Here I can add a few words: the ledger is very important. The law clearly stipulates that it must be kept for ten years, which shows that the paper must be strong and not easily broken. Try to see the cash receipt and transfer voucher. The first step is to go through the form maker, accountant, and approver, and then transfer it to record the various accounts, which must go through several transfers. If the paper is soft and thin, will it not break? Someone said, "[Then domestic products are not good?]" I think domestic products should of course be promoted. Is there any objection to making money yourself? But blindly sticking to the old methods and not knowing how to improve, imitate, and create is really not a positive method! Can we walk long distances because there are no domestic trains? Cutting your feet to fit your shoes or giving up eating because of choking is not a long-term solution after all! Schools across the country use no small number of fountain pens and foreign paper. If we can make them ourselves and recover our rights, it will not be insignificant!</p>
<p>Finally, I have a few words about the book [An Outline of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping]. It says, "Chinese bookkeeping... accounting personnel are easy to obtain, unlike Western bookkeeping... it is difficult to obtain talents, and expenses must be increased everywhere." (See page 2 of the book) It also says, "Improved Chinese bookkeeping... talents and supplies can be obtained at a lower price..." (See page 4 of the book) But it itself says, "Improved Chinese bookkeeping is a bookkeeping method that uses the latest theories." (See page 5 of the book) The author of the book also said in his article [The Four Periods of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping] that his improved Chinese bookkeeping "is no less interconnected in principle than Western double-entry bookkeeping," and also said that it "has never deviated from the principles of double-entry bookkeeping" (see the Shenbao Economic Special Edition of December 15). This shows that the principles of improved Chinese bookkeeping and Western double-entry bookkeeping are the same. Then, to understand the principles of accounting, whether it is improved Chinese bookkeeping or Western double-entry bookkeeping, you undoubtedly need to study and understand the principles. Since this is the case, then I would like to ask... why is it easy to obtain Chinese bookkeepers, but difficult to obtain Western bookkeepers? Is this statement specifically used to explain that the price of Chinese bookkeepers should be cheaper, while the price of Western bookkeepers is too expensive, and that you have to increase expenses everywhere? This statement really has the intention of promoting capital to reduce the wages of labor! This intention may please the capital side, but we people who work hard day and night must raise a serious protest!</p>
