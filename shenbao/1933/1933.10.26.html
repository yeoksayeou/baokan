<h3 id="c19">法國左翼内閣之更迭與金本位之命運 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 有</p>
<p>法蘭西達賴第内閣。因法國中央政府預算平衡案不得通過於衆議院。已於二十四日全體總辭職。達賴第内閣之財政政策。係以加税减政爲前提。堅决拒絕採用通貨膨脹。今法内閣更迭之後。對於法國財政。尤其是法國金本位的命運。究將發生何種變化乎。似不失爲目前世界經濟恐慌中之一大問題也。</p>
<p>法國急進黨達賴第内閣。自本年一月三十一日。於赫禮歐與彭古前後相率下野以後。繼起登臺。爲時僅九閱月。查達氏在職期間。關於財政貨幣諸般經濟政策。始終以支撑通貨緊縮。維持金本位制爲原則。如聯絡意瑞荷比諸國。組成歐洲金本位大同盟。足爲明證。然其内閣竟遭顚覆者。則另有顯著之原因在。據哈瓦斯二十四日巴黎電。政府所提財政法案。中有一條規定公私機關人員之定額收入。無論薪俸恩給。均應納税百分之六。而社會黨之多數派。則堅决表示反對。絕難妥恊。夫法國衆院擁護政府之多數黨。係以急進黨與社會黨合組而成。今社會黨之多數派。旣不能與政府合作。同時政府復視其政策爲絕無猶豫之餘地。内閣自惟有出於全體辭職之一途。故其閣潮事件之本體在此而不在彼也。</p>
<p>吾人再由此次閣潮之另一方面而言。法國現内閣當局之顚覆。亦未必即爲法國行將採用通貨膨脹之表示。蓋以法國國情而論。人民旣未忘戰後法郎跌價之餘痛。政黨亦未敢出此顯違衆意之主張。故以一般情勢推測。法國金本位之能否維持的問題。似不至因内閣之更迭而發動。法國現在之財政。雖值恐慌之時。明年收支不敷。將達六十萬萬法郎之巨。（目前約合英金七千五百萬鎊）將來新閣成立。或不無採用通貨膨脹之可能。然未可即以必然的趨勢相推測。</p>
<p>夫法國與歐洲各國之金本位。尚翹然存立於今日。誠爲一可異之事件。然將來足以决定金本位之命運者。不在於國内政局之變動。而唯在美國貨幣政策之變動歟。隔昨美國總統於其播音之時。明白宣佈美國將提高物價。其手段則一方面收買國内新産生金。一方面則於世界重要金融之市塲。操縱匯價。結果必使美金趨向跌落。然後物價可以抬高。益以英金追隨其後。法郎必將感受重大之壓迫。加以三數年來。法國出口貿易。已减少百分之五十。倘非有法國殖民地爲之消納其過剩之商品。以緩和危機之爆發。則法國金本位。實已有不能維持之勢。故以今日而論法郎之命運。殆繫乎金鎊與金元兩大勢力之如何爭雄長於世界貨幣之市場。是則可爲預言者焉。</p>

<p>本年爲國貨年、滬上各業界領袖、特組織一國貨介紹所、以低廉之價、圖推銷于全國、福州亦爲其運銷之一埠、不意國貨介紹所運閩廉售以後人民固極歡迎、而閩中各商業、則受重大打擊、蓋若貶價與競、則須虧本、設照價出售、而又無人顧問、各種生意、盡被國貨介紹所奪去、由是福建帮、對該所大起反對、上海三山會館爲閩中各商帮之所結集、爲維持本省各帮營業計、恊議拒絕國貨介紹所之貨物入閩、其阻止之方法、係與各商輪公司、議定拒運該所貨物之辦法、</p>
<h3 id="c129">各輪公司接洽 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>查滬閩一路、現有常安·三北·怡和·招商·等四家輪船行駛、平日福州帮往來貨物、以三山會館所屬之各報關行、各客帮·裝載最多、故閩中貨運三山會館之營業最巨、自國貨介紹所事發生、閩帮即托三山會館王君、向各輪公司接洽、請顧全福建商業、勸各輪勿再承運該所貨品、如果再裝、閩帮便停止與該輪公司裝貨、交涉結果、三北·常安·怡和·等均表同情、而閩帮與國貨爭潮、似告一段落矣、</p>
<h3 id="c130">招商裝貨糾紛 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>當時各輪公司、以國貨介紹所僅臨時之營業、而三山會館、乃根本的運輸、故常安首先答應、怡和亦允不裝、三北公司且至會館内、與閩帮歡宴、招商局初亦許可、詎近日國貨介紹所、有疋頭等一百數十件、係向銀行押欵、而裝招商船入福州、閩帮認招商違背其主張、仍在裝運國貨、由是福州客帮、公同議决、一致拒裝招商局船、不論滬閩兩地之進出口貨、概不裝載、糾紛風潮、即由此而起、</p>
<h3 id="c131">雙方交涉情形 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>招商局方面、對於此項疋頭等運閩、係認爲由承押之銀行往裝、而且事前恐引起糾紛、乃由貨主曾向三山會館王君述明原委、而且局内以國營的立塲、在事實上更未能迎此拒披、此拒裝風潮發生後、招商局曾委托市航會出而調解、但聞福建帮方面、必須局中有一種形式的表示、以證明此後不再運載彼貨、始可和解、此事恐難辦到、遂致巳經報運之貨、各閩帮多臨時止裝、今局方對于各該報關行之已經錄簿之貨、須令照付運費、而閩帮則堅不允繳、雙方堅持、正不知如何解决、</p>

<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>遼吉黑的選手，這次參與在首都舉行的全國運動會，當其列隊遊行會塲時，據說，觀衆們，在「非常熱烈」的掌聲中，有不少涙下的。不用說得，在這愉悦的空氣中，「下涙」的原因，自然是爲了這些健兒，已是「有家歸不得」的可憐虫。不錯，我們讀東北選手的宣言，黨國人人的演說，都是以「收復失地」爲骨幹，就是我們這些始終没有聞到東北砲聲的福地上的人們，也不免「一掬同情之涙」。</p>
<p>在這「東北之戰，告一叚落」，「方吉殘部，業已肅清」，「失地各縣，次第接收」，「日貨輸華，突飛猛進」，「中日局勢，有展開望」的「漸入佳境」的靜止時期中，全運會中忽又放了這麽一個「催涙彈」，不知能否再提高民衆們「一分鐘熱度」。</p>
<p>「東亞和平」是否能在「滿洲國」成立之下，安如泰山，就是「文王再世」，怕也要「神課無靈」，因爲要維持「東亞和平」，自非把太陽旗遮遍亞細亞洲不可。要做到這一步，自非先消除蘇俄的陸上威脅，美國的海上威脅不可。消除了這二大威脅，於是乎關了大門，生吞活剥整個中國了。到那時，我們這些福地上的公子哥兒們，怕也就要同今日的遼吉黑的民衆，處於同等的地位，而没有觀衆們可以在「非常熱烈」的掌聲中、「一掬同情之涙」了。</p>
<p>秦人不暇自哀，而後人哀之、後人哀之而不鑒之，大家請閉目想一想，下面一句是甚麽？遼吉黑選手巳是有家歸不得，而我們這些安居在福地的人們，在「非常熱烈」，的掌聲中，爲之「涙下」。但是我們這些安居在福地，而在「非常熱烈」的掌聲中，對東北選手「下涙」的人們，若是「下涙」就算了，大家請閉目想一想，將來怎麽樣？</p>
<h3 id="c252">拔的秘訣 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 鑑因</p>
<p>近來，報上時有「推」「拉」的文章登載，揆其内容，不外乎敎人處世的「推」「拉」秘訣。其實做人的方法，非僅「推」「拉」而巳。依我的觀察所得，做人的道理，還有一個「拔」字。「推」者，將旁人推下火坑，「拉」者不論東西南北，若黄包車般的拉起就跑。至於「拔」却就兩樣，乘人家脚跟不穩，走上奈何橋的時候，將橋拔起，那人就跌入千仭深壑，這是「拔」的功用，自是與旁的不同丨</p>
<p>「拔」還有「正面拔」「反面拔」兩種。「正面拔」是明人不做暗事，當着人前拔他的脚。一提就倒，「反面拔」是乘人不備的當兒，放一枝冷箭似的，從背後將人的脚拔來，於是仰仆裁倒，不過「正面拔」，不及「反面拔」來得容易罷了。</p>
<p>每一個人不想在社會上做一點事業，倒也罷了；若是你幹一番事業，那就非按步就班的將脚跟站住不可，否則就難免「一敗塗地」。假使你只顧裝點門面，雖然是頭角崢嶸，膂力過人了，你以爲這樣便可以不怕人嗎？不丨人家正因你膂力過人，所以不與你較量，只要蹲下將你的脚一拔，你就應手而倒，這是無疑的。因爲你没有將脚跟立定之故呀！這是「正面拔」。</p>
<p>同時，就使你脚根立定，你以爲可保無憂了。詎知拔你的人，他却不來當面拔你，乃是躱在你的背後，兩手揷入你的兩足中間，極力望後一拔你仍在免不了也倒下去。這是「反面拔」的功用，你就工夫到家，也是枉然！</p>
<p>知道拔的厲害的人，他們也不願就此干休，雖然被你拔倒，他仍可爬上臺去。以爲這樣，可没被拔的危險了。殊不知要拔你的人，却要拆你的臺。换一句話說，不拔你的脚，是拔你站脚的臺。「拔臺」就是「拔脚」。終於又要倒下了。於是拔你的人，便可以自己登台。不過你如要報仇，也可以如法去拔他的脚的，記得了嗎？</p>

<p>近日轟傳本市的大鯨魚，在下好奇心動，也曾化去半面大武，前往參觀，哈哈！眞是耳聞不如目見、這鯨出水想必好久，故有了一陣陣的腐氣，黑皮上似塗了油一般光滑，全身不滿百尺，重量决不逾萬，可見上海的事吹牛多，比較在下十餘年前，在那紹興後海鎭龍澱所見者，有大巫小巫之别呢。今將在下所見的，介紹給本市看過大鯨者：</p>
<p>一隻航海的船，儎裝着滿船的鹽包，由那鎭龍澱出口，航海欲往某埠。渡到半海，天色已晚，迷矇中望着對面，似有一座黑山障着去路。這位船主是很細心而熟識港汉的人，見了甚是驚疑，再一細看，可就駭極了。因這座黑山在緩緩地移近船來，這不是海怪，定是魚怪無疑了。那即下令回帆，仍擬駛回，不到一刻，船雖如箭一般的快，那黑山移近船來更比船快，船上的人，都肅靜着，躭憂着，在那裏猛力的駛。黑山愈移近了船，有霧一般的細雨濺到船尾，船主巳曉得危急了。即向艙中取那鹽包，向船尾海中狂抛，黑山雖仍追隨着，在水平線上時有起落，船主知道這是大魚去吞吃鹽包的徵象。於是不斷地抛鹽包，船上儎重一輕，行駛更速，天色將明，巳回原港，潮汛亦過，遥望黑山，巳淤擱在海沙灘上，近而視之，果一巨大無朋之鯨魚，喊聲如牛鳴，因出水之魚，無威可逞，乃雇工將魚拖曳近岸，任人觀覽。一時轟動全境，觀衆欲窮其鰭，須用梯緣背而上，置海岸日久，已發腐臭，割宰其肉，腥臭不能食，熬油作燈火，聞有人取其魚肚出，内有金銀器皿不少，而肩骨似石臼云。</p>

<p>本欄有趙子明和東海波臣二君，先後把王師爺夫婦和王小姐，都介紹過了，所缺少的，還有一位王少爺。</p>
<p>這位王少爺從小就聰慧絕倫，口齒伶</p>
<p>俐：蘋果般的臉，鑲着對怪活絡的眼烏珠，兩片嘴唇紅紅的丨丨和少女們搽了胭脂一樣的紅，所以王師爺夫婦，就把他當做掌上明珠一般地愛護。</p>
<p>可是王少爺雖然秀外慧中，却偏偏不愛書本子。王師爺滿想把自己一肚子的材學敎給兒子，好呌他將來「升官發財」，「光耀門庭」，却不料王少爺翻開書來：就連呼「頭暈」不止；他非但這樣的厭棄書本子，却還唤他父親是「書蠧」。王老爺見他這個樣子，不由得大發雷霆，一聲呼叱，唤　子跪在家堂前，咬着牙關，把他鞭笞起來。那知道王師母一見情形，頓時暴跳如雷，聲涙俱下，駡一聲你這個老糊塗蟲，我們又不要他去考狀元，何苦硬迫他讀這勞什子來；你我現在年紀一把，所剩下的，祗有這點骨肉，你若逼死了他時，我這老命將來靠着誰去！說得王師爺連一句話都答不出來。</p>
<p>從此王少爺益形放浪，鎭日價與一般無賴少年挾妓嫖娼，拈花惹草，不時就染上了芙蓉之癖，精神日益萎靡，遠不如從前了。</p>
<p>王師爺夫婦，見兒子這般没有出息，終於鬱鬱寡歡，相繼過世了。據說：王師爺王師母謝世之時、眞是王少爺在堂子裏，和一般娼妓們尋歡作樂的時候，而且喪葬等事，王少爺一切都不管，全由親戚們主張料理，　同時家中産業，亦被爭取一空。自此王少爺手頭漸形拮据起來，告貸無門，終於淪爲乞丐了。</p>
<p>王少爺想起前事，眞好比做了一塲「黄粱夢」。</p>

<p>第十七回孰能無情家思灰士氣兵不厭詐豪語壯軍心</p>
<p>我們的部隊到了防地，馬上就可以發餉，在過八月中秋節的日子，咱們都可以足樂一陣子。這一開拔，先不用扣火食啦，餉是多少錢，就剩多少錢。再說咱們當兵的人，若是只圖個安樂，駐防在那裏，指望一輩子不挪蠻，那裏是出頭之年？當到營團長以上的人，誰不是吃過一程子辛苦的。所以這回開拔，到京東去，那是咱們的好機會，碰各人的造化，誰也說不定會有作官發財的機會。這一派離開軍人天職才應當說的話，可是這班大兵聽了，都以爲是天經地義，没有一個不眉開眼笑的。倒不像連長們那樣焦慮，怕是打外國兵去。趙自强看看自己的訓話，已經有了幾分力量，這就向兵士道：在今天上午的時候，大家可以去寫家信，過了下午，就怕没有機會了。說畢，又分派着排班長幾項任務，也就走開。這樣一來不要緊，連長立刻就忙起來了。手下三個排長，有兩個是有家眷的，兩人要向連長借一口袋麫安家。上士司務長和連長是最親密的人，也各自要借幾塊錢還賑。因爲幾家店舖裏的伙計，聽到大軍突然要走，賬討不起來，都哭了。人心都是肉做的，怎好完全置之不理，所以也來和連長商量，多少給人家幾個錢。兵士們雖是不能借整塊的錢，整袋的麫，但是他們，也各有各的苦衷，第一就是連長的命令，要寫信，可以各寫一封家信回去。這信紙信封算是不成問題，可以到連部找去。這寄平常信的五分郵花，足足五分大洋，就不曉得要到什麽地方找去。說不得了，這點芝蔴大的小事，不能不請連長帮一點忙。（二二三）</p>

<p>證章是半價劵？氣谷雲夢的火車，開出了上海北站，約莫將近眞如的時候，走來兩位身穿黑呢制服，平頂帽上綴着金　徽記的檢票員。便是崔萬秋先生所著的「新路」小說裏，日本人稱他是車掌的。果然中華人，决不能像日本人那般虚僞的假謙恭說：「對不起，請你給票子我看」。但是比較以前，背後常隨着三四個提了盒子砲的武裝憲兵，那般感勢好得多了。在我的對面，坐着兩位首都機關裏的職員，（或者是官，因爲我没有請敎，所以無從斷定。）檢票員向他們取票一瞧，却是買的半價劵。便道：「請將證章符號取出一騐」。一位胖胖的，便在口袋裏，拿出一枚藍色金字的圓徽章，那檢票員騐明無訛，便在票上，軋了一下，還給他。還有一位西裝先生，摸索了許久，却拿不出。說：「忘記帶在身邊」。檢票員便道：「那是部裏的命令，没有證章，無論何人，都要照章購全票的」。那位西裝先生，也很漂亮，並不因他們没有武裝兵士隨護而反抗，在皮夾裏取出一張五元中央鈔幣，照補了事。我却未便問那查票者，這項證章，是否只限於首都的軍政或鐵道機關有效？假使憑着一枚官家的證章，都可以對折付鈔的話，那麽鐵路部的收入預算表上，似乎還得小小的打一個折扣。</p>
<p>▲拍床沿呌喜　家樂到天賜莊博習醫院裏去探望伊弟婦的病，一定要我陪伴伊去，我因爲乘便要到小青兄府上，也便一口允應了。那裏知道，伊進了病人的臥室，陡的感到一種虚幻的空想，和現實的藥味衝擊了一下，神智忽然恍惚地失去了巳身的主宰。那時因爲我並没有進病房，在樓下客廳裏，和内弟講話，伊偶然探頭出來瞧我，恰巧拐灣角上，一個女護士，走將出去，伊眼光裏，又感覺到白衣的一閃，心裏不禁别的一跳，伊在複雜的錯覺裏，竟受嚇了。晚上睡覺，不住的跳醒。我和伊本是一對素來主張打破迷信，不信一切神鬼的同志。這一遭可是竟不由自主地，想到了「拍床沿呌喜」。我是呌不來的，特請岳母施行，果然眞靈，伊自從呌喜之後，便一𥈝睡到大天光。這大概也是心理作用吧？我不是在這裏提倡迷信，因爲事實的奇異！把他記了出來，就當他是用催眠術治療，又算是精神感應。那麽這種催眠術，的確是我們的國粹，並不是什麽東西洋發明的把戲。</p>
<p>▲猪油糕的頌讚　白糖玟瑰猪油糕，和五香茶葉蛋豆腐乾，却也是旅客們的吃食三部曲。可是猪油糕，只通行於蘇州的車站，而其他站頭，和車中都没有的。我因爲它是蘇站的特産，所以在待車的時候，特别注意到牝。一個長面瘦臉的中年男子，正蹲下了身子，料理他的業務丨猪油糕丨。先將没烘熱的糕塊，在一只上鋪鉛皮，下埋火爐的籃子上面，排了一個圓陣，再五塊一排的，逐漸在燒熱的鉛皮上烤，一股甜香的味兒，很足使一輩餓肚的旅客，嗅到了垂涎三尺。烤好了，和訓練新兵一般，便推陳易新的另换一排冷的上去。倘使顧客不踴躍，他便釜底抽薪，將鉛皮掀起，用一雙鐵箸，將爐裏的熾炭箝出。或者因爲暫時不需要旺火，便在爐邊箝上一塊圓形有孔的小鐵板，蓋在上面，壓平那五分鐘的熱度。可是在這當兒，野外無情的風吹來，把爐裏白灰飛揚出來，播送到猪油糕的上面，好似加上了許多胡椒末，因爲顔色的不能差别，没有顯著的情形，給顧客看到，所以他的猪油糕生意，也還不惡。他忽然一陣縐眉，將籃兒提到月台的邊上，自己縱身一跳，到荒野的軌道裏，扯開了袴兒便殺鳥！一面回頭凝視着籃兒，以防有不道德的人偷他的糕，一回兒事畢，依舊跳上月台，恰巧有一個小孩，手裏拿了七個銅子，向他買糕，他也並不將方才殺鳥的手，加以揩拭，伸出五個指頭，掇了一塊，給那小孩子，小孩子也便喜孜孜的塞在嘴裏嚼吃。這就呌「眼不見爲淨」！</p>

<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>▲文章費經營妙手自得之</p>
<p>在這國貨年中，市面不景氣，一般的人，都感着購買力薄弱，再加了外貨拚命的推銷進來，做生意之難，難於上青天，我們經營國貨事業的，於研究出品的精進，講求成本的减輕以外，對於生意經一道，當然要研究研究，纔是道理。而且做生意千萬不可做刻板文章，譬如以前國貨之敵，大家總說只有進口貨，可是增加進口税，施行出産地標記條例，實行傾銷税以後，又有兩個新敵人，一個是偷税的外國貨，一個是外人在華設立的工廠，我們應該及早準備纔是。</p>
<p>秋風加緊，月餅時代過去了，冼老閭也忙好了，我們偶然和冼君談談生意經，居然得到冼君一席經騐而有趣的話，很有介紹的必要。</p>
<p>冼君說：做中秋節令的月餅生意，彷彿是做一篇大文章，名人做文章，可以請人槍替，我做文章，却須自己用心動筆。在中秋月前，我先在腦筋中要打底稿了，怎樣布局，怎樣煊染，怎樣襯託，怎樣結構，都須多方設計，百般研究，纔可做一篇當行出色的好文章出來。做月餅生意，眞是不容易：多做了，銷不完，店中悔氣。少做了，人家買不到，駡得臭死。要銖兩悉稱，恰如其分，便看我們做文章的本領。我們在這中秋節的數天内，眞是做文章的緊要關頭，絲毫不肯鬆懈，每天我的司令台上，要守着五個人，時時注意，步步留心。一個是專管廣告的，一個是專司店外調查的，一個是專司門市調查的，一個是專管工塲製造的，一個是專管統計研究的。譬如店外調查員回來報告說：今年各店月餅，以蓮蓉爲最暢銷，那麽，門市部多準備蓮蓉月餅。工塲中加工趕製。統計研究的，連忙把所得分别報告，呌各部分注意起來。廣告員也更變换方法，别出心裁。我呢，居中策應，左指右揮，到了中秋節的晚上，一算出品，不多不少，恰到好處，這篇文章，便好好交卷，大家心上一塊大石頭，方纔卸輕，你想巧妙不巧妙？原來做生意，本要如此的，何况做一來行的生意，大凡做生意都是一來行的居多，時髦衣料，是一來行摩登服裝，是一來行，任何一種商品，初初出世，都是一來行，可是千萬不可馬虎大意，只想賺錢以斵喪自己的事業，减損買主的信任，結果，仍是自己吃虧，試問有多大好處？</p>
<p>冼君的話，我想國貨界領袖，爲推廣事業計，多有研究和採用的價值。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c283">統制生産與發展國貨 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>隨世界經濟恐慌的狂濤，同時汹湧澎湃在我們面前的「統制經濟」聲浪，在現下，高唱入雲，可說是已爲我們舉國上下異口同聲的論調，但我人須知這個新名詞的由來，並不是一種空泛的論調，而是一個建設在社會上面的實體，他最主要的部份，即爲「統制生産」，以期國貨生産事業能以最合理化的計劃統制而進展，務使生産與消費的同時增加，及分配平等與生産方法，國民生活之改善，而竭力防止外貨輸入，以臻國家經濟於最安全鞏固之途。</p>
<p>所以，「統制經濟」，若以狹義的範圍來講，或許也可以就稱之爲「統制生産」，蓋其最要之目的，無非爲求國貨生産事業之能得政府輔助，同業恊調，以最合理化之計劃及施行，而謀整個事業之發展，同時再力求免除其營業上的矛盾與衝突，而得各方面産銷之均衡，由以前漫無計劃之生産，而走入有計劃丨「統制生産」的階段，在這現實和過程上，我們再可合乎以前的情勢，來作一個現在的借鏡。</p>
<p>年來國貨生産畢業，雖亦曾轟轟烈烈，已有相當的進展和成績，但總因我國商業制度之私有化，大都均採用「自由經濟」，謀個人企業之發達，雖間或亦有以聯合營業之組織，但却總也不能保持其常態，而卒至分崩潰裂，各自爲謀，於是同業傾軋，跌價競爭，社會上滿呈惡劣之形勢，以生産落後，尚在萌芽時代之我國工業，試問能常此受暴風雨之侵襲，而思有以改之否！</p>
<p>我們須深切明瞭，我國是生産落後的國家，對於生産額與消費額，只有二與五之比，所以，在目前，國貨事業的挺進，和人民工業品的需要，是絕對成正比例的，不過過去是因我們的毫無計劃及分配，使全部工業軋多薈萃於一隅而競爭，而失敗，此後我們所急需的眞是如何使供求平衡，産銷適應，及支配地域問題，將如何以其歷史上及地理上之關係，而給與確切的規定，普遍於地廣人衆的全國，務使國貨工廠旣無生産過刺的恐慌，人民方面也無因國貨無着而以外貨替代的恥事，應興應革，全都有望於道「統制生産」的成功。</p>
<h3 id="c284">國難與國貨 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 胡麗文</p>
<p>今年是國難年，也是國貨年，已經有人在報紙上談過了。我這裏所要說的，是國難與國貨的連帶關係：</p>
<p>國貨公司裏登着大廣告說：「國難如此，中國人，應當用中國貨！」一般資産階級的太太小姐們，她們是根本就不曉得有國難在：而且她們都存了一個心，中國貨穿在身上，是很難爲情的。所以公司裏的廣告，雖然登得那麽大，她們却連正眼都不瞧一下。</p>
<p>至於那些窮苦的人們，爲了國難，社會不景氣，經濟没落，一天想肚皮不呌餓都很難得，身上的衣服舊了，破了，也只好媽媽虎虎的了，就是國貨布疋便宜到一個錢買一疋，他們也買不起呵！</p>
<p>這樣。國貨便爲着國難而滯銷了！</p>
<p>但是，很奇怪，在這國難時期，中國貨這樣的滯銷，倒不料外貨反大銷而特銷起來。這不是假話，而且連過去都不必談，本月的報紙，只要你肯去翻，一定可以找出許多外貨傾銷的例證。唉！國難造成了國貨的滯銷，却也增加了外貨的銷路，我眞不知中國人存的是什麽心？</p>
<p>照這樣下去，中國將來國難如果還要增加的話，市面上充滿了外貨，國貨店便只好關門大吉了！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c285">防止外貨輸入的幾個先决問題 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>果然，這是毋庸瑣說的，外貨傾銷的結果，是必然使入超激增和國産不振，金錢外溢和工商消衰，倘然他是再一蔓延性的話，那末，狂濤之所及在最迅速的時期裏，便會立刻有財政破滅與金融徧枯的發現，其危險性足以制國家經濟於死命。</p>
<p>但是，事實的過去，年來我國的市塲狀態，却正應着了上面所說的現象，而走入了這最嚴重的階級，陞堂入室的帝國主義，可說是没有一個不思以經濟一服妙葯</p>
<p>的侵略，謀市塲的獨佔，鈎心鬥角，把自己做刀俎，將我們做魚肉、看外貨之前來，已如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，直到窮鄉僻壤，一往無遺，於是入超上，便顯露了從來未有的巨數，這是我們如何痛心的一回事。</p>
<p>雖然，提倡國貨與振興實業，業巳成了我國舉國上下的口頭禪，異口同調，呼聲一致，對於他過去的努力及未來的佈置，也確已得到相當的成績，深堪自慰，不過，我們總不懂外貨的輸入，在海關上的估計，却總是一天高着一天，巨大的數字，足使我們驚心動魄，以我的淺見，大概總有下列的三個原因，我們要掃除障碍，不得不舉出來討論：</p>
<p>一關税問題　處現下商戰劇烈之秋，世界各國無不壁壘森嚴，無孔可入，但我國却以過去之關税不能自主，坐使侵進，即現下亦税收其低，且又不徵傾銷税。</p>
<p>二在華外商特惠問題　外商在内地設立工廠，以雄厚的資本，完全的設備，再利用我國低廉的工資及免除捐税的方便，其出品自然影響了我們尚在萌芽時代的工業。</p>
<p>三航運問題　我國内河航路，任使各國自由行駛，亦足爲增進外貨輸入的媒介，只要看最近在仇貨。活躍聲中，各日輪的營業發達，便是一個很好的借鏡。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們一方面果深切明瞭，只要國貨生産的力求改進，和民衆拒用洋貨的根本覺悟，那麽國貨事業的前進，總是蒸蒸日上的，不過，我們也不可太忽視了旁的一切，上面所舉三者，就是我們認爲現下最主要的先决問題，若不於最短期内，而有相當的解决，那麽恐怕萬目睽睽，尤其是一般國貨廠商，如大旱之望雲霓，而企其早日成功的，「防止外貨輸入」問題，將永無澈底解决實現的一天。</p>
<p>婦女與國貨</p>
<h3 id="c286">婦女怎樣提倡國貨 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 楊爕理</p>
<p>民國十八年度日貨輸入中國共計三○六，九三○千關兩，其中我曾仔細分析過，大概非生産品（消費品）佔全數百分之七十，而非生産品中婦女所常購買的貨品，又幾乎佔到全數百分之四十三强。這百分之四十三中，雖然說不定也有一小部分爲男女所共同購買的，不過這項數目竟超過非生産品的半數以上，實在是驚人的。婦女所用外貨的多，由此可見一般。</p>
<p>婦女購買外貨爲什麽這樣的多，大概不外下列二原：（一）年青的婦女好虚榮尚時髦！愛美原是青年婦女的天性，不過她們的「虚榮心」太大，「時髦慾」太重了。她們崇尚奢靡，愛慕摩登，一切服用裝飾，大都競用外貨，以相矜炫：價值愈昻，好像愈可顯出他們的富貴。於是大家閨秀爭奇鬭勝，提倡於上；而小家碧玉亦羡其艷麗，相率效尤，竭力模仿，幾乎非舶來品即爲不時髦，不用外貨即不足以稱摩登。甚至國可亡家可破，而不時髦不摩登却不可！此其原因一也。（二）年老的婦女比較缺少愛國心及識别力丨我國婦女，因爲敎育的比較不普及，和敎育制度的不良，所以對於國家觀念，非常薄弱，其中以年老者爲尤甚。並且，她們除購買什物外，不常出門，對於外貨的種類，不大留意，買時又祗揀便宜，靈巧，和美觀的東西，所以最易被奸商利用，往往買了外貨，自己却還不知道呢。這就是多購外貨的第二個原因。</p>
<p>觀乎上述兩個原因，婦女的多購外貨，實非無由，我們要提倡國貨，婦女的責任，實在是很大的。</p>
<p>並且，所謂國貨，當然包括衣食用三種，而我國習慣，男子治外，女子治内，家庭中所用的衣料鞋襪，兒女的服裝食物，以及一切日常用品，大半由婦女購辦，倘婦女眞能提倡國貨，其效力當在男子之上。</p>
<p>那末婦女怎樣才可提倡國貨呢？約略言之，可分三項：（一）要提倡儉樸丨過度的消耗浪費，逾量的趨向奢華，這在人生行爲上是背道而馳的。警如衣服，本來只求清潔適體，無需十分美麗奢華，國貨實巳可用，婦女不妨以儉樸爲美德，竭力提倡國貨：一面旣可减少家庭負擔，一面又能效勞於國家呢！（二）要改變觀念一「時髦」「摩登」本來没有一定標凖，不過一時風尚所趨罷了。試看數十年前，婦女都以小脚爲時髦，所來此風一革，婦女倘仍纏足，那就成爲笑話了。所以知識界的婦女如能以身作則，購用國貨，轉變目光，視用國貨者爲時髦，那也未始不能移風易俗。（三）要留意識别丨婦女可將日常用品詳細檢查一下，自己不能識别的東西，可以請敎懂得的人。看看自己究竟用了多少外貨，好做日後的警戒。或者合了幾家，將外貨用品收集起來，作爲標本，供大衆參觀，減少大衆受愚的機會。</p>
<p>有人說：奸商因爲要投合許多婦女</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的購心　，纔不顧國家的存亡利害而購進外貨。我以爲這話並不過分：因爲從經濟學的原理上看，購主的需要是决定市塲與生産數量的主要條件，若使處於消費者和購買者的主位的婦女，能减少或消滅對於外貨的需要，則奸商一定要自嘆失策了。</p>
<p>現在婦女參加社會活動和爲國家盡實際力量的，也着實不少了，在這件事上，我想一定更可以一顯自己的力量！</p>
<h3 id="c287">來！我們大家國布武裝！ <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 南國佳人</p>
<p>深秋衣薄作何想？　國土長淪喪；　怎樣臥薪嘗膽　　願大家國布武裝！</p>
<p>新近有位朋友從海外回來，他從南門口丨香港，廣州丨進來，經過了東南門，丨汕頭，厦門丨再進了東門，丨上海丨入了新建的正廳丨首都丨看看這邉，看看那邊，十分高興。我因爲和他久别重逢，便開口問他：「你去了國外幾年，回來看看自己老家，東北一整塊田地，巳經無抵押地奉送了蠻横的東隣。看了國内的東穿西落，是不是有國亡無日之感呢？」</p>
<p>那位朋友却給我一個碰釘子的答案道：「我看中國不亡，民族却有復興的氣象呢，舉一個事實爲證，便是穿西裝和學生裝的摩登男女比從前多了，鞠躬如也的長衫同志，似乎比以前逐漸减少。」</p>
<p>我聽了大失所望的佯笑道：「錯你了！穿短裝的同志，尤其是西裝，所消費的差不多都是洋貨。這些寳貝，都是替外國工廠添加資本，替帝國主義增加海陸空軍勢力來壓迫我們弱小民族的。那裏是興國氣象，簡直是亡國的急先鋒罷了。」</p>
<p>那位朋友不待話畢，咬著牙關解釋道：「短裝是勞動界的服裝，無論怎樣，總比類似袈裟的長衫大袍便利些。我們要民族復興，便要每個國民抖擻精神；那非把文縐縐的長袍學著趙武靈王胡服不可。如今國産布品蒸蒸日上，只要大家用國貨製短裝，那末形式精神兩方面，不是都可改進了嗎？」</p>
<p>「我所見到各地西裝少年之中，除了幾個大學敎授，有錢的時髦小夥子，搭著燈籠架子的行政人員在那裏穿著洋貨的西裝外，有許多比較克實的青年都是喜用國布製短裝的。至於各校學生的制服，那更不消說得。」</p>
<p>「至於摩登女子的旗袍料旣大半都愛用國産。效法西裝的女子呢，更可以說是『國家將興，必有禎祥』的表顯。我看到很多的外國女子，不管是老的少的，媸的俏的，差不多都喜歡買中國的絲織物和繡花品當作時髦服裝。外國男人的服裝講究「挺刮」，女子的服裝却講究「輕飄」，國外有很多國貨的商店，都是靠著外國的摩登婦女賺錢的。要是國内新時代的女子，大家學著西方美人競用國産的絲棉織物製就摩登服裝，豈不是直接消費她自己丈夫或家長的剩餘金錢，間接在那裏提倡國貨嗎？」</p>
<p>「總而言之：國布武裝運動是比一切的口號，一切的要人宣言，都來得實際有效！」</p>
<p>我聽他說得有理，便和我的「内閣總理」「小阿斗」一齊國布武裝起來。</p>
<p>農村與國貨</p>
<h3 id="c288">鄉村與國貨運動 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>▲大家到鄉村中去提倡國貨</p>
<p>在這個國貨年的年頭兒。提倡國貨的口號，差不都已喊遍了中國的全境。然而我們覺得宣傳的分量。都市中和鄉村中。似乎相去很遠。在一般負着宣傳國貨的使命者。十九在城市中從事提倡國貨運動。而把到鄉村中去宣傳的使命却丢掉了。不負上肩頭。</p>
<p>我們覺得都市的人們。心是早已死掉了。在中國。不拘那一個都市。愈是熱鬧。洋貨愈是充斥。不信。你看在大上海的都市之中。所謂遠東的巴黎者。西裝的少年。華服的少女。汽車的來往。機車的奔馳數量的繁多。將超出全中國的都市</p>
<p>這是無可疑義的。在上海是一個包銷洋貨的大本營。如果上海是毁滅了。中國的進口貨。至少减去一半以上的紀錄。洋貨和文明。成了正比例的向上。在都市中的人們看來。不穿西裝。不坐汽車。似乎不配稱文明人。在這一種浸滿了洋氣的城市中。提倡國貨的儘是每天在宣傳。買洋貨的儘是去買洋貨。而宣傳的效力。雖非失之殆盡。也是微而又微呢。</p>
<p>所以我以爲於其在都市中宣傳國貨運動。不如先到鄉村中去宣傳。在鄉村中雖然因爲環境的不同。地位的不同。洋貨的是否侵入。洋貨的消費如何。不能把每個鄉村一例看待。但無論如何。鄉村中外貨的消耗。决没有都市的鉅量。是一個不可否認的問題呢。</p>
<p>而且。就事實上說。像和都市距離較近的鄉村。受了環境的支配。年輕的村男和村姑。多少受了些都市化了。因此洋貨的侵入。也已佔有一部分的勢力。但年老的農民。也許衣食住還没有用洋貨的需要。至於和都市距離較遠的鄉村。交通不便的地方。那洋貨便是絕跡的。</p>
<p>我們祗要走到一個農村之中。便會看見農村裏的父老。他們頭上戴的是氈帽。身上穿的是老布衣服。土布的襪。布底的鞋子。他們的身上。什麽都是國貨。住的房子。也由中國工匠造的。並不是洋房。家裏的用具。也十九是國貨。吃的白米和魚肉。更是土産物品。所以我以爲這些人才。是提倡國貨的實行者。我們在鄉村中所見的一切。完全和都市中不同。絲毫不染一些洋氣。</p>
<p>然而話要說回來。在鄉村中一般父老門。他們所需的衣食住。都是國貨。但近來一般年青的農家子弟。因爲受了大都會。小城市。耳濡目染的影響的緣故。也有喜用洋貨的傾向了。銅盆帽。紗襪。皮底鞋子。闊一些嗶嘰。華達呢的袍子。也有幾件日常用的東西。也一意醉心奢華。購買外貨。所以洋貨在鄉村中的勢力。也在隨着時間之輪膨脹起來。</p>
<p>中國是以農立國。四萬萬的同胞之中。農民佔其多數。所以農村所佔的區域。也比較都市所佔區域爲廣。現在洋貨還在最初的侵入農村。假如將來洋貨在農村的勢力擴大以後。使中國各地的農村。都有洋貨的侵入。那麽我們相信每年洋貨進口數更將千百倍於今日。前途是一件極危險的事情。</p>
<p>在這個緊急的關頭。趁着洋貨在鄉村中的勢力。還没有根深蒂固。我們正好到鄉村去極力宣傳。提倡國貨。使一般的農民。知道購用洋貨是一種自殺政策。非常危險。說明種種利害關係。使得所有的農民。都不用洋貨。因爲在鄉村中用洋貨的人。比較還不多。所以國貨的宣傳和提倡。也比較容易些。效果一定比都市中大。所以，我以爲提倡國貨。抵制外貨。應當先向鄉村中去宣傳。</p>
<h3 id="c289">搪瓷器皿與農村 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>搪瓷製造品。是一種經久耐用品。其品類。若面盆。若食籃。若飯碗茶杯等。尤爲人生日用所必需者。照社會經濟原則論。凡人民置備必需用品。是均合乎經濟原則。今舉必需品。而有經久耐用者可選擇。則其有功於一國之社會經濟者彌大。此不獨提倡國貨一端巳也。</p>
<p>方今倡用國貨。高唱國貨深入農村爲口號。不幸比年農村經濟衰落。農人購買力薄弱巳極。此國家整個問題。自有積極的救濟必要。惟國貨應否於此時推銷至農村。和農村之是否需要國貨。此先决問題。凡負提倡國貨之責者。是當注意者也</p>
<p>今之談救國論者。僉主張儉約運動。我國農民之儉約。可謂全球冠。遠且勿論。江浙農民。迄今仍多穿大布衣。燃菜油燈。甚至仍有打石取火者。即浦東一帶鄉農。迄今仍多以木盆洗臉者。其他可知矣。夫提倡國貨對象。是係拒用外貨。今農民對於外貨尚無多大需要。雖因缺乏購買力。要亦需用不多之故。今欲國貨深入農村。自亦當有所選擇。蓋稍一不愼。則由提倡國貨。而成爲提倡奢華。此亦一重大研究問題也。然則。今日國貨之應行深入農村者。究係何屬。則非搪瓷製造品莫屬矣。</p>
<p>我非獨爲搪瓷工廠作宣傳焉。蓋搪瓷係經用品。其出品種類。尤十九係農人所需用者。同一洗臉盆也。今購買木質者。非銀四五角不辦。易以小號搪瓷盆。計銀二三角足矣。且輕巧潔淨。有益衛生非鮮。化銀一角。可買搪瓷飯碗一只。曾見農人習用之粗笨瓷碗。雖每只止價錢百餘文。然一經失手。即告無用。搪瓷飯碗。則百跌不破。無論若何使用。亦能用至三年。至使用瓷質者。則三年期間。至少用去十餘只。或竟二三十只。成一與二十比矣。此乃事實。非代其巧爲說張也。他若如晒曬粉類。則有搪瓷之圓盤方盤。儲藏種子。則有搪瓷之大鍋小鍋。是皆潮濕所不能侵入。蟲鼠所無法傷害。問其價格。則較竹木器爲低廉。舉凡各式搪瓷器皿。幾無一不合乎農村用具。至其搪瓷倉籃一種。尤係農村田忙時。陌上送飯妙品。荳羹菜湯。分别陳設。圍坐啓食。烈熱猶存。不僅其樂陶陶已也。於是。今後農村因使用搪瓷器皿。而愈經濟。愈節儉。搪瓷器皿。因深入農村。而愈發達。愈價廉。我乃不禁大聲疾呼曰。農村萬歳。搪瓷器皿萬歳。</p>
<p>參觀筆記</p>
<h3 id="c290">章華毛絨紡織廠參觀記 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 吳一恒陳叔英</p>
<p>▲參觀動機　我國毛織品市場，向爲外商所壟斷，計每歳流出金錢，恒在三千萬以上；幸邇來國人劉鴻生先生創辦之章華毛絨紡織廠，異軍突起，所出織物，質料方面，幾駕舶來品而上之，且定價低廉，因之聲譽雀起。所出各貨，不脛而走。想不出數年，必能摒外貨於國門之外。同人等久耳章華之名，亟思一覘内容，藉稔我國新興事業之大概，祗以旣鮮熟識介紹，更乏充裕時間，因之夙願難償，殊爲憾事。</p>
<p>▲襄理函招　暑假開學後，我校許佩行先生，得該廠襄理吳伯匡先生函招，囑同人等前去觀光，同人等一行二十三人，爰於九月十七晨九時，在新關碼頭搭乘該廠自備之小輪成行。此行所至，旣承殷勤招待，復蒙詳示内容，因得於二小時内，遍歷全廠。自原料以迄成品，並每種搜集標本一份，作爲生産敎育之村料，使同人等獲益非淺，固叨吳先生之賜也。兹將參觀所得，關於各種毛織品之紡織經過，記述如左，想亦爲國内人士所樂聞也。</p>
<p>▲紡織原料　該廠採用之原料，兹分别述其種類，來源，用途，及採用數量於後：</p>
<p>甲，種類</p>
<p>（一）羊毛（綿羊）</p>
<p>（二）駱駝毛</p>
<p>（三）棉紗（駝羢用）</p>
<p>乙，來源（羊毛）</p>
<p>（一）國内　甘肅，西寗，湖南，湖州，山東，河南，山西，西藏，</p>
<p>（二）國外　澳洲</p>
<p>丙，用途</p>
<p>（一）上等呢絨，（大衣呢，馬褲呢，直貢呢，華達呢）用駱駝毛或山東羊毛和以澳洲羊毛織成。</p>
<p>（二）中等呢絨，（制服呢粗嗶嘰等）用湖州羊毛和以山東羊絨織成。</p>
<p>（三）次等呢絨，（軍衣呢，駱駝絨等）用棉紗爲經，湖州羊毛爲緯織成。</p>
<p>丁，採用數量</p>
<p>（一）湖州羊毛最多。</p>
<p>（二）山東羊毛次之。</p>
<p>（三）駱駝毛又次之。</p>
<p>（四）棉紗僅供駱駝絨背面之用。</p>
<p>（五）其他各地羊毛及澳洲羊毛現時採用不多，惟該廠預定日後將增加上等呢絨産量，屆時採用之數量又當激增矣。</p>
<p>▲機械　廠内現有機械，大部爲舊日暉織呢廠所出讓，屬比國出品居多。陸續添購者，即英國法國出品均有。除揀毛，織補，剪量諸工作，須全賴人工外，其他一切工作，均全部應用機械。綜觀全廠機械不下二十餘種，都凡百餘架。大别之有蒸氣發動機，電汽發動機，洗毛機，烘毛機，和毛機，彈毛機，梳毛機，染色機，紡紗機，摇紗機，織呢機，拉絨機等，</p>
<p>▲工作情形</p>
<p>（一）紡</p>
<p>一，揀毛　揀毛係女工專利事業，工作時全憑一己經騐。每一女士前，放一竹匾，傍置篾簍數事；毛之最優者，投入第一簍。較次者分投二三四簍。其不堪使用者，謂之脚毛，供製織粗劣毛毯地毯之用。</p>
<p>二，洗毛　毛經揀過後，放入洗毛機内洗滌。機凡五具；每一洗毛機之缸内，用水和以適度之皂與酸，然後加温至規定熱度，使附於毛片上之植物質及汚質（如草葉，灰塵等）完全除去，而於毛纖維之本質，則毫末未損。經過五次漂洗後之毛，則雜垢盡除矣。</p>
<p>三，烘毛機係蒸氣裝置，温度極高，機體係一直立而扁平形之方鐵箱，中分四格。最上一格烘過後，自動傾於第二格，復傾於第三四格，最後則自動傾於箱外，如是循環不息，此外尚有烘灶，烘櫉各一座，一日工作所得，可供全廠應用，毛經烘過後，如需以紡織本色呢絨嗶嘰者，則付諸彈流或取出漂白。否則須經染毛子續。</p>
<p>四，染色　該廠染色，純用上等顔料。此項顔料和水加温後，能被所欲染之毛質完全吸收凈盡，所餘仍係一缸清水。是項顔料，價格昻貴，但染成後之物質，可永不退色。染色所用之缸，專染羊毛，駱駝毛。其餘木質方形者，則用以染毛紗絨線等物。更有旋轉不息之機械，則以染織成之疋頭。據吳先生語予等云：「凡預備染色之毛或毛紡織物，事前必先權定重量，然後和以適度之顔料。苟配合不當，則染成之顔色，每不能如預期之圓滿。」</p>
<p>五，和毛　烘過之毛，經决定紡織何種呢絨後，須經過和毛手續。例如紡織上等呢絨，應在山東羊毛内和以澳洲羊毛。紡織中等呢絨，應在湖州羊毛内和以山東羊毛。務使質料堅剏，成本恰當，以保持其出品之盛譽。</p>
<p>六，上油　毛經洗滌，色澤方面，大都作象牙色。如即用以紡織呢絨，則毛質輕鬆易於飛揚。出品必慘澹無光故和毛之後，必須加油於毛上，翻覆攪拌，使毛色光可鑑人，然後用以紡織呢絨，則出品亦必鮮艷奪目矣。</p>
<p>七，彈毛　上油後毛仍混合一起，且纎維結實，非經彈鬆則不能紡紗。</p>
<p>八，梳毛　梳毛機每套有三架，第一步將羊毛成爲薄絮形再成捲筒狀，經第三機梳後，即成絨線條。</p>
<p>九，紡紗　毛經梳成線條後，再置於紡紗機上紡成細紗。如需製成合股絨線則置於合線機上合成。如需將染就之毛紗呢則置於倒紗機倒成筒管。</p>
<p>十，摇紗　經過合線即預備出售，或紡成之紗須加染色者再須經過摇紗的手續，即成紗線絞頭。此項成品有多種：如織呢紗線，駝絨線，毛絨線等是。</p>
<p>（二）織</p>
<p>一，凖備　凖備工作，即牽經拉扣等等</p>
<p>二，織呢　織呢的機器，其構造原則和普通織綢布之機大略相同。不過機身較大·可織門面闊七八尺之呢絨。每機有二女工司其事，遇經緯線折斷時，立刻停機接頭，然後再開機續織。故所織之呢絨，自始至終，極少挑線斷頭之弊。</p>
<p>（三）整理</p>
<p>一，檢查　呢絨織成後即舉行檢查，如發現破綻，立即交女工修復。</p>
<p>二，修補　修補大都用鑷子把斷頭鉗去，或把挑線用針挑好。但細察在場女工，修補斷頭者有之，發現挑線者絕無。</p>
<p>三，洗呢　在機上取下之呢絨，不免染有油漬或汚質，因之織成之呢絨，概須加以洗滌。洗滌時把呢絨懸掛空中，然後逐漸入水。入水之呢絨，經沸水翻騰震動，汚漬自去。如此周而復始，不多時巳將全匹呢絨洗凈，然後另易第二匹。</p>
<p>四，縮呢　縮呢係用機器把呢縮緊，使質地加厚。</p>
<p>五，烘呢　呢經縮後，猶未全乾，再須置諸烘呢機上烘乾，機之一端，接連着長約二丈左右之小室，室内温度極高。濕呢由機入室，在室中須往復兜繞四五匝，再由機的下部掛出，斯際已完全乾燥矣。</p>
<p>六，拉毛　拉毛分兩種機器：上等呢絨，係置於一嵌有植物壳（壳如蜂窠而壳表多尖軟之刺，其名不詳）之機上拉毛。因壳刺尖軟，故拉後呢絨本身絕不受損。此外如駱駝，軍衣呢等較次之呢絨。則置於一滿佈鋼絲之機上拉毛。吾儕參觀時，得覩駱駝絨拉毛，駱駝絨未拉毛時，其薄如毛巾布。經拉毛機上先後拉三次後，不特增厚數倍，絨質亦柔軟美麗可觀矣。</p>
<p>九，剪　壓蒸摺量　呢絨經拉毛後，再經剪光燙平壓蒸摺量等之許多手續方可付諸包裝。此等手續，皆用機械。</p>
<p>▲發展計劃　據吳先生語予等，該廠預定之發展計劃，目下正在進行中者，有下列數事：</p>
<p>（一）增添夜工　章華出品，供不應求，爲應付定貨及减低成本起見、將開始夜工，蓋揆諸科學管理法物盡其用之原則而論，廠屋和機械，固無休息之必要，增添夜工後，祇多支一筆工資，而出品可增加一倍。如是則成本可減低、貨價亦可較賤，外貨自必蒙其影響矣。</p>
<p>（三）添購新機　該廠現有之蒸氣發動機，所費多而效率低，不久擬全部改裝電力發動機。又廠中現缺乏紡織高等呢絨之各項機械，最近已向英國訂購大批，不久即將到達矣。</p>
<p>國貨介紹</p>
<h3 id="c291">國貨的手帕 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>近來我國每年十二萬萬的金錢，一年多似一年的流到外國人的手裏，而美觀的舶來品也一年的多似一年的輸進來。因此，市塲上所見的國貨，竟一年年的落後了。這是何等可痛的事！</p>
<p>許多青年男女們，居然也覺得這金錢流出的可惜，就提倡國貨，於是今年稱爲國貨年，大家都像很熱心似的。但是五分鐘的熱度一過，又紛紛的在購買舶來品了。</p>
<p>一輩所謂摩登男女們，男的是畢挺的西裝，女的是時代化的新裝，那男的在左面的一隻小袋中往往塞着一塊小小的手帕，女的在絲紐扣的中間，也往往塞着一塊小小的絲手帕。這塊手帕，恐怕十分之九都是舶來品，眞奇怪，難道我們國貨中没有這種手帕嗎？</p>
<p>手帕的確是一件實用的東西，是日常所不可不備的，近來舶來品的手帕，充滿在市場上，不計其數，購買時，一不小心，便買了劣貨回來，眞是寃者枉也。</p>
<p>現在我可介紹一種眞眞國貨的手帕，也是國貨中傑出者，就是國人所創辦的華達手帕廠，他們所製的三羊牌手帕，原料優美，式樣摩登，顔色鮮艷；樣樣都比得上舶來品，廠内的置備是新式機器，全用科學製造，出品旣良好，因此銷行日見擴大，現在計算曾銷到的地方，國内是華北華南華中，國外是南洋羣島一帶，貨品雖然趕緊製造，但還不夠分配，也可見我國的手帕工業，正大有希望，但願全國男女同胞們，快快購用國貨手帕，莫把寳貴的金錢，送到外國人的手裏去。</p>
<h3 id="c292">國貨保暖水瓶 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 更上</p>
<p>保暖水瓶是一種日用的必需品。尤其是在冷天，牠的效用更爲顯著。</p>
<p>家庭裏只要備一個熱水瓶，就時時可以有熱水吃，那是很便利的。有人說中國人的愛國心，如果都能像熱水瓶那樣，每日保暖二十四小時，那麽仇貨洋貨决不會在中國如此的暢銷。這雖然是一句滑稽話，但是也確實含有至義。</p>
<p>現在天氣漸漸冷了！買熱水瓶千萬認清，不要買了仇貨。最好到五洲藥房去買國貨「九九熱水瓶」，那種水瓶式樣美觀，凖確耐用，可說駕於洋貨之上，到於「九九」二字，因爲每件只售九角九分的意思。</p>
<h3 id="c293">國貨史乘一年來之國貨化妝品業（三） <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 葉鍾廷</p>
<p>（四）化妝品廠當前之危機</p>
<p>舶來化妝品。可分東西洋兩種。東貨自經一再抵制後。頓漸銷沉。自佔領吾東北後。國人益知奮勉考其在華之銷路。僅占我國總額百分之一而已。至西洋化妝品銷行於吾國通都大邑。根深蒂固。其勢甚盛。雖集中各廠之力量。以與抗衡。而其風行如故。由此可證國人崇拜洋貨之心理。牢不可破。而以號稱爲高等華人。及摩登婦女。爲尤甚。洋商旣獲鉅利。常挾其資本雄厚之權威。以與吾華廠爲敵。平日窺伺市上。如有暢銷之華廠出品。必牽强附會謂與其出品相似。誣爲影射。是故實業部商標局。法院。常有此類案牘。吾國大工廠當之。尚可與之作正義上之周旋。而小工廠之資絀及膽怯者。常委曲求全。自願銷燬所爭議之商標。不再使用。于是洋商志得意滿。而吾國小工廠受摧殘矣。</p>
<p>同時化妝品廠。以牟利爲目的者。往往發生一種病態心理。揣知國人喜用洋貨。乃于其出品上盡用異國文字。並標以某某洋行等字樣。購者不察。極易受欺。在製售者。表面上似可藉口以與洋貨競爭。但跡其用心。則有數典忘祖之嫌。與其謂購者不知愛國。毋寗謂售者不知愛國爲確當也。</p>
<p>此外爲同業間之互相傾軋。尤足陷化妝品業之前途於萬刦不復之地步。常見市上有一暢銷之出品。類似者。必有數種。其名稱裝潢等等。幾可亂眞。此内幕無庸解釋。顯係貪利之徒所爲。結果。彼此跌價。以謀競爭。終至價愈跌。而工料愈趨窳劣。失去顧客之信仰而後已。此種見利忘義之心理。至爲卑鄙。絕對不能引用祇知摹倣而無創造性之辭之寬恕之。往日南洋之銷路。年在一百萬以上其中以廣生行先施公司及永安實業公司尤占優越地位。國外貿易。有此成績。良非易事。乃近來僑商對於國貨。已漸冷淡。其原因。卽於各廠互相仿冒。其偷工减料。粗製濫造之弱點。雖能掩飾一時。而日久乃暴露無遺。於是此多年苦心經營之大好市塲。竟爲少數不知自愛之同業所破壞。而坐視日貨又取而代之。此在吾國幼稚之化妝品業。歷史上。寗非至可痛心者乎。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>化妝品業受内憂外患之壓迫。已如前述。長此以往。如不力圖進展。前途實爲可慮。故在今日吾國化妝品廠。急宜振作精神。痛改前非。精誠團結。整齊步伐。以準備與洋貨作正面之衝擊。其所應採取之有效步驟。應專心從事於「質」的改良。「量」的增進。「價格」低廉。「市塲」的開拓。並聘化學專家研究。如何製造化妝品之原料。使見諸實施。以供給各廠應用。俾可不再仰給於人。否則舶來化妝品。縱可絕跡於中國。而原料方面之漏巵不塞。事實上。仍屬無補。至各廠營業。雖有利害衝突之處。但各應努力求其物質本身之進步。以謀出路。市上可以令人滿意之出品尚不多覯。儘有推銷之機會。切勿作損人而不利己之勾當。以自趨於墮落。甚至令整個化妝品業蒙受惡劣之影響。果能物美價廉。國人除少數資産階級非用洋貨不足表示豪富外。其稍知以國家利益爲前提者。當能轉移其習尚。論者對於國貨銷路之阻滯。每歸咎於用者之不知提倡。吾則以爲在出品尚未充分精良。價格尚未儘量低廉之前。殊難以此說。令人折服也。試一研究。以往所以能推倒東貨之故。卽可思過半矣。蓋人以實力見迫。吾惟有以實力抵抗。吾則空言抵制。或作無謂之感慨。皆非强有力之表現。如能脚踏實地。繼續運用以往推倒東貨之力量。而更充實之。則西洋貨不難擯之境外。而國貨自有抬頭之日矣。此艱鉅之使命望與吾化妝品業共起肩之。</p>

<h3 id="c294">自由談「滑稽」例解 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 韋素</p>
<p>研究世界文學的人告訴我們：法人善於機鋒，俄人善於諷刺，英美人善於幽默。這大概是眞確的，就都爲社會狀態所制限。慨自語堂大師振興「幽默」以來，這名詞是很通行了，但一普遍，也就伏着危機，正如軍人自稱佛子，高官忽掛念珠，而佛法就要湼槃一樣。倘若油滑，輕薄，猥褻，都蒙「幽默」之號，則恰如「新戲」之入「Ｘ世界」，必巳成爲「文明戲」也無疑。</p>
<p>這危險，就因爲中國向來不大幽默。祗是滑稽是有的，但是幽默還隔着一大段，日本人曾譯「幽默」爲「有情滑稽」，所以别於單單的「滑稽」，即爲此。那麽，在中國，祗　尋得滑稽文章了？却又不。中國之自以爲滑稽文章者，也還是油滑，輕薄，猥褻之談，和眞的滑稽有别。這「狸猫换太子」的關鍵，是在歷來的自以爲正經的言論和事實，大抵滑稽者多，人們看慣，漸漸以爲平常，便將油滑之類，誤認爲滑稽了。</p>
<p>在中國要尋求滑稽，不可看所謂滑稽文，倒要看所謂正經事，但必須想想。這些名文是俯拾即是的，譬如報章上正正經經的題目，什麽「漸入佳境」呀，「中國到那裏去」呀，就都是的，咀嚼起來，眞如橄欖一樣，很有些回味。</p>
<p>見於報章上的廣告，也有的是。我們知道有一種刊物，自說是「輿論界的新權威」，「說出一般人所想說而没有說的話，」而一面又在向别一種刊物「聲明誤會，表示歉意」，但又說是「按雙方均爲社會有聲譽之刊物，自無互相攻訐之理」。「新權威」而善於「誤會」，「誤會」了而偏「有聲譽」，「一般人所想說而没有說的話」，却是誤會和道歉：這要不笑，是必須不會思索的。</p>
<p>見於報章的短評上的，也有的是。例如九月間「自由談」所載的「登龍術拾遺」上，以做富家女壻爲「登龍」之一術，不久就招來了一篇反攻，那開首道：「狐狸吃不到葡萄，說葡萄是酸的，自己娶不到富妻子，於是對於一切有富岳家的入發生了妬嫉，妬嫉的結果是攻擊。」這也不能想一下，一想「的結果」，便分明是這位作者在表明他知道「富妻子」的味道是甜的了。</p>
<p>諸如此類的妙文，我們也嘗見於冠冕堂皇的公文上：而且並非將牠漫畫了，却是牠本身原來是温畫。『論語』一年中，我最愛看『古香齋』這一欄，如四川營山縣長禁穿長衫令云：「須知衣服蔽體已足，何必前拖後曳，消耗布匹？且　勢衰弱，……顧念時艱，後患何堪設想？」又如某地禁女人養雄犬文云：「查雌女雄犬相處，非僅有礙健康，更易發生無恥穢聞，揆之我國禮義之邦，亦爲習俗所不許。謹特通令嚴禁……凡婦女帶養之雄犬，斬之無赦，以爲取締！」這那里是滑稽作家所能憑空寫得出來的。</p>
<p>不過「古香齋」所收的妙文，往往還傾於奇詭（Ｇrotesk），滑稽却不如平淡，惟其平淡，也就更加滑稽，在這一標凖上，我推選「甜葡萄」說。</p>
<h3 id="c295">「怒吼吧，中國！」的演出 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 陳奕</p>
<p>「怒吼吧，中國！」是在上月就演過了，可是因了旁的事，錯過了這機會。這晚是第二次演出的末一天末一塲，無論如何是非要去看看不可了。</p>
<p>到劇場裏坐了好一會，幕才開，一景一景的過去，一氣的把牠看完了。</p>
<p>關於這劇的演出，我很想說幾句話。</p>
<p>（一）劇本方面。這劇本是外國人作的，而且曾轟動了全世界的劇壇，自然，是有着牠的價值的，但是其表現的力量是否夠呢？這就是一個值得思考的問題了。當我讀這劇本的時候，我還不覺得，今晚一看了牠的演出，就發覺牠的力量的薄弱，這一面固是緣於這次演出者把劇本的内容略有修改丨丨如删去一個迷信一塊黄布可以抵擋槍砲的和尚的神仙劍俠這類人物；如對艦長跪下哀求的大學生的這一動作；如茶房自殺的理由等等；而另一方面也是原作者對於曩露帝國主義的壓迫殖民地民衆的殘　手段，和殖民地民衆反抗的精神受壓迫的痛苦，丨丨這兩點表現的不足。因此全劇就覺得鬆散了。或許因作者是外國人，對於中國人被壓迫的殘惡的情形並不十分明瞭，或許因這劇本的譯文不佳，總之，這劇是不覺得怎樣緊張和深刻的。</p>
<p>（二）演出的技巧。關於這一點，可以分幾方面來講。</p>
<p>Ａ演員，在演員之中，飾外國人的化裝實在不行，簡直没有外國人的樣子。表演方面只有艦長和買牛皮的美國商人比較好些，其餘的都不能現出是一個外國人的風度，幾個女的更不行。工人方面要算是第二船夫和其妻好一點，火夫是全劇中最重要的一個角色，可是演員却不能完成在劇本中應負的使命，動作又非常的做作呆笨，只有老船夫和船夫老　還算過得去。至於大學生那就太糟了，本來在劇本中，當他上軍艦的時候，他是懼怕的，可是演者却把牠表現成一個勇敢的大無畏的人物，這種性格的錯誤大約是導演應負着責任的吧！</p>
<p>Ｂ佈景·這次的佈景，在中國的舞台上可說是最偉大的。然而仍是不大像，軍艦上的大砲，一看就知是假的，高的望台也很簡陋，扶梯，鐵格是動摇的，而且大砲與望台連在一起，這我還没有看見過。第一景碼頭的樣子太不像，輪船與眞的完全不同了。小烟店的景算是好些，不過那扇門太漂亮點，船埠景是最好的一場佈置，可是也還不眞實，每一碰到就動摇起來。還有一點，就是後台人員没有消除過去的劣點，老是在佈景幕後動來動去。</p>
<p>Ｃ燈光，燈光實在太糟了，老是動的，强烈而没有一定的方向。探海燈本是從望台上照下來的，可是却把牠弄成從望合的前面打來的了，如果那不是探海燈，那麽它又是幹麽用的？若說是别處的探海燈，它是絕對没有照到軍艦上來的理由的。小酒店的燈光更是奇怪，外來的光比内面的光還强，我們試問那天晚上是不是有月亮？是不是門外恰好有路燈？</p>
<p>（三）整個的演出和効果。這劇的全部的演出，可以說是没有力量的，演員的動作，表情，說話都不能動人而給觀衆以深刻的印象，完全不能發生劇的効果。幾個不同人物的意識的表現也不能充分流露出來。可以說：這劇的効果，只是給人留下有這末一回事的印象，而没使他們明瞭帝國主義的兇惡和中國民衆的痛苦。</p>
<p>最後，我在這裏用着十二分的誠意，向戲劇恊社和戲劇界的朋友們說一句：請你們再用些心血去努力這一事業，而把牠的力量擴大開去，使一切處着與劇中工人一樣痛苦的民衆，都能夠看到聽到！</p>

<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>前幾天寫了一篇「撲空」之後，對於什麽「莊子與文選」之類，本也不想再說了。第二天看見了「自由談」上的施蟄存先生「致黎烈文先生書」，也是「兼示」我的，就再來說幾句。因爲施先生駁覆我的三項，我覺得都不中肯丨丨</p>
<p>（一）施先生說，旣然「有些新青年可以有舊思想，有些舊形式也可以藏新内容」，則像他似的「遺少之羣中的一肢一節」的舊思想也可以存而不論，而且寫「莊子」那樣的古文也不妨了。自然，要這樣寫，也可以說「不妨」的，宇宙决不會因此破滅。但我總以爲現在的青年，大可以不必捨白話不寫，却另去熟讀了「莊子」，學了牠那樣的文法來寫文章。至於存而不論，那固然也可以，然而論及又有何妨呢？施先生對於青年之文法拙直，字彝少，和我的「感舊」，不是就不肯「存而不論」麽？</p>
<p>（二）施先生以爲「以詞取士」和勸青年看「莊子與文選」有「强迫」與「貢獻」之分，我的比例並不對。但我不知道施先生做國文敎員時，對於學生的作文，是否以富有「莊子」文法與「文選」字彙者爲佳文，轉爲編輯之後，亦以這樣的作品爲上選？假使如此，則倘作「考官」，我看是要以「莊子與文選」取士的。</p>
<p>（三）施先生又舉魯迅的話，說他曾經說過：（一）「少者中國書，其結果不過不能作文而已」。可見是承認了要能作文，該多看中國書；（二）「……我以爲倘要弄舊的呢，倒不如姑且靠着張之洞的『書目答問』去摸門徑去。」就知道没有反對青年讀古書過。這是施先生忽略了時候和環境。他說（一）條的那幾句的時候，正是許多人大呌要作白話文，也非讀古書不可之際，所以那幾句是針對他們而發的，猶言即使恰如他們所說，也不過不能作文，而去讀古書，却比不能作文之害還大。至於（二），則明明指定着研究舊文學的青年，和施先生的主張，涉及一般的大異。倘要弄中國上古文學史，我們不是還得看「易經」與「書經」麽？</p>
<p>其實，施先生說當他塡寫那書目的時候，並不如我所推測那樣的嚴肅，我看這話倒是眞實的。我們試想一想，假如眞有這樣的一個青年後學，奉命惟謹，下過一番苦功之後，用了「莊子」的文法，「文選」的語彙，來寫發揮「論語」「孟子」和「顔氏家訓」的道德的文章，「這豈不是太滑稽嗎」？</p>
<p>然而我的那篇「懷舊」是嚴肅的。我並非爲要「多獲羣衆」，也不是因爲恨施先生没有推薦「華蓋集正續編」及「僞自由書」；更不是别有「動機」，如因爲做學生時少得了分數，或投稿時被没收了稿子，現在就藉此來報私怨。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>當船靠岸時，在那裏等候着的巴巴格里水手，便牽着兩個女人的手把她們接上岸來；大家便進了城。街上閑人很多，都是每天滿潮時到堤岸去閒跳的人，他們也回來了。</p>
<p>羅蘭嬷嬷和陸太太走在前面，後面跟着三個男子。當走上巴黎路時，她們有時停在一家帽店或一家銀樓面前細看着一頂帽子或一件首飾；隨着，彼此表示了一點意見之後，又走開了</p>
<p>在交易所廣場前面，羅蘭老爹和平常一樣瞻望着那船舶停得滿滿的並被别的港汊延長起來的交易港，巨大的船身，肚子碰肚子地在那裡面停泊着四五排。那些靠着碼頭綿互到幾個公里的無數的桅杆，那一切附着帆架，檣頭，繩索的桅杆，使這城市中心的裂口現得像一個很大的死樹林一樣。一些海鷗便盤旋在這没有葉子的森林底下，等到有人把什麽殘渣擲在水裏時，便像一塊石頭落下般的直飛下來；還有一個學做水手的幼童，在一根高桅的頂端裝置一個滑車，看去好像爬在那上面去尋覓鳥巢似的。</p>
<p>「你願意和我們一塊吃一餐毫不客氣的晚飯，一同完結這天嗎？」羅蘭嬷嬷問陸太太。</p>
<p>「那自然好極了。我也毫不客氣地接受着。這樣同游了一天之後，孤零零地跑回家去，會感到非常凄寂的。」陸太太回答。</p>
<p>聽到了這番話而早就因那少婦對於自己的冷淡感着難堪的筆爾，輕輕說道：「好，這寡婦現在竟自己插進我們家裏來了。」最近幾天以來，他稱呼這女人做「寡婦」。這名詞雖什麽也不加以說明，却使哲安聽到那音調就感着憤懣，在他聽來，這名詞是險惡的，含着凌辱意味的。</p>
<p>於是三個男子直到他們的住宅門前爲止，再没有說出一句話。這住宅是一座仄狹的，上下共有三層的房子，位置在柏爾諾曼德街。他們家裡的使女約瑟芬是一個十九歳的小女孩，是一個從鄉下出來的廉價的女僕，臉上特别富於鄉下人那種驚異和粗蠻的樣子，她跑來把門開了，讓大家進來，再把門關上，跟在主人後面走到位置在二樓的客廳裡面，然後說道：「有一個先生來過三次。」</p>
<p>每次和這使女說話都免不了要怒吼着的羅蘭老爹，呌道：</p>
<p>「究竟是誰來過，難道他没有名字嗎？」</p>
<p>她是從來不因爲她主人的咆哮而慌亂起來的，她又說道：</p>
<p>「公證人（Ｎolaile）家裏的一個先生。」</p>
<p>「那個公證人？」</p>
<p>「那麽，說是卡魯先生家裏的好了。」</p>

<h3 id="c299">南北民性 <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>在朋輩的談吐中，通常有着這類的謔語：「下江狐狸」，「山東塊頭」，「湖南蠻子」，「江西老表」等等，除了山東塊頭是專指其身材碩大而言外，其餘的彷彿都可作民性觀。</p>
<p>講到民性，在中國確是南北有南北的民性，各省有各省的民性，甚至各縣不同，某一小地域都有其特殊而顯著的民性。</p>
<p>不過大别我們可以「南」「北」兩大體系來概括它。</p>
<p>生息於北方的人，是有着這麽幾種特性：</p>
<p>第一是豪爽，韓退之送董生序中有云：「燕趙古稱多慷慨悲歌之士」，這誠然說得有理，北方的人，無論說話作事，大抵都很豪爽，不那麽枝枝節節彎彎曲曲，口不從心，行不顧言。</p>
<p>第二是保守性很强，說來話長，免不了要牽涉到社會進化史上去，就是北方的社會，無疑的還有着很濃厚的封建餘孽，封建社會的特質就是保守，所以北方的人們，也就逃不了這社會意識的統闊，每個都有些保守性，大事不講，就是對日常瑣事的處當，也往往愛唱「蕭規曹隨」的調子，循規蹈矩，景行行止，不肯大踏步地向前進，尋求新的獲得。</p>
<p>第三是禮尚特甚，這許是格源於咱們的幾位老牌聖賢都是北産，而又因咱國的文化奠基於此，朝代遞沿，禮已深鐫於一般人的腦中，不獨成了習慣，簡直成了一種遺傳的民性，與人接物，無不攘攘然禮尚往還，說他硬是虚僞，却又不是，總之北方人多有一種愛講禮的特性。</p>
<p>講到南方的人，也有着幾種顯著的特性：</p>
<p>第一是狡猾，每常意識「下江狐狸」這一句口白，倒是頗有來歷，我們知道狐狸是種狡猾的走獸，江浙一帶的人，大抵就外不了白面書生，油腔滑嘴，口是心非，裝腔作勢，這爲的恐是社會較爲進化，複雜，生活困難所致。其他如山清水秀，鍾育靈化，也不無關係，比如「天堂蘇杭」的人，就特别來得伶俐狡黠。此外如商業特别發達，商人就擅長「欺詐」，也總算有相當姻緣。</p>
<p>第二有一種冐險的進取的特性，這可拿兩件事實來作說明，一是華僑的冐險向外洋發展，幾乎全是南方如浙閩粤的人：二是革命事業的爆發，遠點說，滿清統治二百餘年，要廣西洪秀全之流才敢來亂衝一下，事雖未成，實可表率一般。繼着就有孫中山先生出而發難，辛亥革命，得以告成。自此以後，十五年的北伐，一直到現在，都可說明南方人。站在當時某種立塲上說，這種進取性，是一種不好的民性。但事實上你說要他寗靜些，規矩些，那眞不會聰從，寗願斷頭斬腰，而險是不可不冒，不走海外，便向國内衝。這種不安於成，而作進一步的探索，倒也確確實實是社會進化所必需者。</p>
<p>第三是蠻性，比如湖南廣西雲貴的人，就盛行着蠻，硬碰硬，硬得上就算好漢，在地理敎科書上是有「湖南人性多蠻」的叙述，「川軍」「桂軍」「湘軍」都很著名，他們就愛幹這一套，幹得巧，就當大將英雄，搏老虎，是他們不以爲奇的，這與開化程度很有關係，在這些省份内，現在正還有雜居着大批的苗民土著呢。至於文化與文人，自然是比較低下而欠缺了。</p>
<p>南北民性之差異，已概述如右。豪爽也罷，狡猾也罷，都不是好現象，我們覺得在同一民族裏只能有統一而優美的民族性，斷不應有因地而異的民性。但咱們的民族而竟是這樣，丨民族性却没有統一而優美的，各地的民性倒如此。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>强烈的發展，母怪「散沙一盤」，「各自爲謀」了。這，原因安在？（一）不能不歸咎於交通不便，南北旣没有天成的江河貫達，（連一條短短的運河也淤塞了）又没有一條鐵路直通南北，什麽公路更不用說了。（二）敎育不普及，文盲在百分之八十以上，也没有統一的國語，當然人民間是缺乏聯絡與溶匯的工具及可能性了。對症下藥，有待乎謀國者之猛省。秋風秋雨之夜作於鴿籠似的小室。</p>
<h3 id="c300">母與女 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 老三</p>
<p>那個多說話的老婦人在陸公館中與陸太太作幾度談話之後，陸小姐的姻事僅僅再經過一次相親就可以解决她的命運了，同時也放下了陸太太十多年來壓在肩頭上的重擔。</p>
<p>雖然是個偌大黑牆門的陸公館，除了陸太太和陸小姐之外，就是被她們僱佣來的男女僕人了。這陸太太的陸老爺，過世得很早，大慨還在陸小姐二三歳的時候。幸虧遣給她們一望住宅，和不少的存欵，生活自然不生問題，可是陸太太丨丨那時候當然還是陸少奶奶想想年紀輕輕守寡，也幾次尋死覓活過來。陸太太的母親還健在，她日夜規勸她的女兒說：「姑爺雖死得這般早，遺下來的一點也夠你們母女兩個開銷，這個女孩兒將來也有半子之靠，做娘的自己不也這個樣嗎？年輕人别這樣浮燥，給人家笑話！</p>
<p>後來陸太太不知是否爲了將來有半子之靠，或者恐被人家笑話？苦心孤志撫養她的女兒陸小姐。</p>
<p>陸小姐養到十五歳，眞　謂沉魚落雁，閉月羞花，好一個嬌滴滴的女孩兒。陸太太眼見自己的希望做了一半，陸老爺餘多的幾個錢，還是都化在這女兒身上罷；很大方的將女兒送進女學堂去讀書，陸太太一邊積極做她後一半希望的工作。</p>
<p>然而時代不是時代了，陸小姐一進學堂處處都變了樣，鬧着要剪去頭髮還是是小事，做出來的衣服，件件是陸太太　　了眼睛没有見過的，那樣的奇形怪服，不過想想自己祗有這末一個女兒，兒　　了她而且這類衣服穿在女兒　　别漂亮似的。</p>
<p>慢慢地事情又變了卦，陸小姐每天回家從没有翻過一百書，老是坦着頭寫那牢什子的信，一張一張，塞滿紙字簏。陸太太自己是不認識字的，起初以爲是學校裏的一次功課，後來被她　常進出的一個裁縫無意間發現了上面有許多哥哭妹妹的話。陸太太這纔發了急，自己這末一個嬌滴滴的女兒，别被那般野男子驅了去，她就硬生生的把女兒關在家裏，不許再去讀書，自己一方面加速度將媒婆王媽請到家裏來秘密商量，重託她奶奶地替陸小姐找了婆家，並且許了重重的愿心。</p>
<p>所謂重償之下，必有勇夫，王媽的一對膀子樣的脚，在陸公館的黑牆門裏進進出出跑了幾十回，說妥了一家開銀樓的，獨生一子，生得那麽好看，和陸小姐配起來眞是一對碧人，又在什麽大學畢過業，家裏有錢當然不必說，祇要開銀箱的頓使陸太太眉笑心開了，不過不過男家要瞧瞧小姐。在陸太太的意思，我的女兒有什麽比，上人家的，不願意這麽怪模怪樣的做出來，把自己嬌生慣着的女兒白送給人家當貨品一般的觀看。當然，這又需要王媽的脚了，男家却執意要先看小姐，王媽那張善說話的嘴又說了許多什麽人家什麽人家她做的媒，都是大家先相親的，再是什麽現在都要小姐少爺自己看對，不要將來要怨爺娘。陸太太被她說動了心，現在旣是如此，就約一個日子，讓自己瞧瞧女婿倒底是個何等樣人物。</p>
<p>王媽這樣來來往往的跑了一個多月　在　　吉日　　跑出相親的日子，兩家　　，約家在戲院　瞧了個飽。　　　郯　　　　　　　　　　　　　家方面，雖然僅僅母女二個人，却大大的意見不同，陸小姐是讀過書的女學生，對於這般紈褲子般的銀樓小開，是滿眼睛的不願意。陸太太以爲祗要姑爺面上不缺眼不缺嘴，最使她一萬個願意的是家裏開着銀樓，她的一世人是爲了半子之靠而活着的，有這麽的女婿豈肯輕輕放過，於是母女二個日夜爭論着，王媽一日三次的聽回音。…………</p>

<p>自　校練好琴出來、經過ＸＸ路，看見長蛇般的結連着有許多人力車放着，車子旁邊都立穿着破舊的老藍布衫，袖子捲到高高，褲脚也高捲着，着了草鞋分外的安靜地像候審般的等候着，我不知道其中的啞謎，因此雖然走過了這大堆的人力車，反又走回來，看它一個究竟。啊！原來是一家ＸＸ人力車公司呀。在正門口放着一隻圓圓的類似桌子般的東西，上面有鉛筆紙頭，旁　立着一個身材高大的「洋大人」，在不知寫些什麽，「洋大人」身旁，有一個矮小的舊皮包骨的，穿着常青　服的華人，手裏握一根棍子，這大約就是所謂「工頭」啦。一個菜色面　的黄包車夫拖了一輛車子出來，經過這高矮特别懸殊的兩人間，他在抖戰着徐步走着，走過華人工頭面前，工頭就怒目瞅了他一眼，提起手裏的棍子，欄阻了車子的去路，於是殷勤地揭開了車箱，用和善的眼光望着「洋大人」待「洋大人」側目檢查，矮小黄臉的工頭仰望着洋大人的鼻息，態度眞是怪樣的。直等「洋大人」微點尊首，工頭把棍子狠命的一揮，車夫好是像好刑庭上釋放的囚犯，没命地逃跑了出來。同樣的一輛的車子都受着同樣的檢查。（其實不知在檢查什麽，我眞的無從知道起）。檢查過後，魚貫般的車子停在公司門首，黄包車夫，都是束着手，如順服的綿着一般，在門外候着第二次的審刑，第二次的『洋大人』的「分付」。</p>
<p>這現象已由特殊的而成爲平凡的事了。可是以兩條健腿，一身臭汗，護得一毛錢或二毛錢代價的人力車夫，他以整個的身子，整個的靈魂廉價出賣來的獲有而地聽「洋大人」的命令自己是好像絲毫没有覺得。但在顧客剥削了他一二枚的勞腿錢，他方才會凸出了眼，怒目叱之，投他一個白眼不算，還要加敬一聲『你媽的？』</p>

<p>— 開瑀</p>
<p>我過學生的生活巳十餘年了，如果把十餘年來學生對於家庭的態度，和對於情人的態度，兩兩比較一下，也許會寫成一本小册子，但是時間總是不許我這樣的實行，所以現在只得先由家信和情信談起：</p>
<p>文字是語言的符號，這句話誰也不能否認的：信是利用文字寫成的，那自然是在互通信息：但是同是信，在學生寫來，却有家信和情信的不同：寫情信時，好像文字都是活的，可以滔滔不竭：一寫到家信，却變成死了，一言不出。只就現在書坊看，精裝的情書，一天多過一天，而家書却如鳳毛麟角，便可以證明一切了。情書盛，家書衰，也許這句話可成定律，至少在現在學生界。空話不談，現在我且引一段同學的經騐談爲證：</p>
<p>某同學說，他一寫起情信，總是滔滔不竭，不特量多，而且質美。他說有一夜，睡鈴已響，各同學都預備睡了，他燃起蠟燭，動筆千言，由認識說到初戀，由初戀說到熱戀，由熱戀說到接吻擁抱…等，不覺五十張的信紙，寫過三分之二，結束時好像還有紙短情長的餘憾：但是一寫起家信，就覺得乾澀無味了，除了一手邊拮据，請即匯欵○○元」外，簡直無話可說了。他說此種情形，曾詢問過許多有愛人的同學，結果都是一樣的。現在他要和幾個同學，實行用印刷來代替家信的方法，寫時只消塡塡罷了，把節省下的時間，用來多寫情信，眞是一舉兩得。其信式如下：</p>

<p>我是一個將近成年的弱女子，二年前，很快樂地在小學校裏畢了業，正想升入高小，不幸家父營業失敗，宣告破産，一貧如洗，所以我也就輟學了。輟學後，除工作之外，暇即翻閱書報，以增進我的智識。對於貴欄，我是最喜讀的了，對於你們的答案，使我敬佩到五體投地。現我亦有一個急切的問題，要煩先指敎我。</p>
<p>世上惟一愛護我的母親已去世了，父親年亦老了，我將來依靠父母的希望，已完全没有了。但年紀一年年的大起來了，對於生活技能，還是一無所長。所以我急欲覓一個正當的位置，以習一技之長，爲將來生活的基礎。但不知何種職業，爲女子正當的職業。像電影明星，我没有天才，是不能做的。洋行機關銀行裏的職員，我没有資格，也不能勝任。公司商店職員，又有一種惡名詞（即花瓶），我心裏又不十分願意做。呀！羅了！我實在没有法子想了，惟有請敎你先生指示了，請你答允罷！先生祝你</p>

<p>編者按：歐陽女土，因爲母亡父老，瞻顧前途，生活毫無保障，想覔一個相當職業，謀所以自立之道，這是很合理而且很切要的。其實一個女子，就是没有歐陽女士這一類的環境，也需要找一個職業。在目下生存競爭劇烈時代，没有一個民族，可以容許至少佔半數的女子，只消費而不生産。女子縱不爲個人或一家生活計，也應當爲全民族的經濟計，而從事於生産，食之者衆，生之者寡，這局面决不能維持的。</p>
<p>歐陽女士對於電影明星等一類的職業，因爲自問没有天才，不敢嘗試；對於機關，洋行，銀行等職員，因爲不能勝任，不敢造次；足見很有自知之明。原來我們不論男女，對於不合天才，不能勝任的事，萬不可存了徼倖，冒險嘗試；因爲弄到後來，終不免淘汰。頂了石臼串戲，吃力不討好的。至於你說有些職業，有一種像花瓶一類的惡名詞，所以不願意做；這郤錯了。我們應當知道，這種不入耳的論調，在說者自喪人格外，於我絲毫不受損失。况且在這提倡女子職業的時代，我們正需要多數有大無畏精神的女子，來與這般破壞者奮鬭。等到女子職業普徧化了之後，等到女子職業，有了相當成績之後；這種魔鬼，自然會退縮的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Mongolian Travelers in Peiping Call on Huang Shaoxiong to Present Opinions on Autonomy; It Is Necessary to Open Up the Gap Between Han and Mongolian Civilians; Oppose Zhangjia and Others Obstructing Local Autonomy; Huang Shaoxiong Discusses Mongolian Affairs with Huang Fu; Changes Departure Date to Tomorrow with Zhao Pilian; Will Meet with Various Princes in Suiyuan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) Eight representatives from the Inner and Outer Mongolia Peiping Fellow Countrymen's Association and the Mongolian Relief Committee, including Jierge Lang, Baowei Han, and Zhao Fuhai, called on Huang Shaoxiong this morning to present five opinions from the Mongolian people on the issue of autonomy: (1) Welcome Huang to inspect Mongolia and plan to hold a welcome meeting to facilitate the contribution of opinions; (2) Inquire about the central government's policy towards Mongolia and the tasks entrusted to Huang; (3) Declare that the Mongolian autonomy movement is based on the late Premier's teachings and is a demand of all Mongolians, not just a few individuals; (4) In this autonomy movement, attention must be paid to opening up the gap between Mongolian and Han civilians and implementing the union of provinces, counties, leagues, and banners; (5) Oppose Zhangjia and others obstructing Mongolian autonomy. Huang responded to (1) with a polite refusal due to the tight schedule and provided satisfactory answers to (2) through (5), stating that it involved major central policies and was inconvenient to disclose. The representatives were satisfied and plan to submit their written opinions today. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Huang Shaoxiong stated that his opinions on the central government's handling of the Mongolian issue are detailed in the explanatory statement. However, in the past, during the Qing Dynasty, the central government implemented an active policy of keeping the Mongolian people ignorant. After the Xinhai Revolution, for more than twenty years, it changed to a passive laissez-faire approach. Now that the Mongolians have raised the issue of demanding autonomy, the central government should pay attention to it. After my investigation, I will start by assisting Mongolia to have a sound political organization, so that the Mongolians can obtain the genuine effects of autonomy. This is the central government's main purpose in handling Mongolian affairs. I plan to go tomorrow, first to Zhangjiakou, to exchange opinions with all relevant parties, and then go to Suiyuan to meet with various princes. Currently, many league and banner princes are in Suiyuan. Prince De has already sent a telegram to welcome me, hoping I can depart immediately, fearing that if delayed, the weather will turn cold, and the princes will be eager to return. Various Mongolian banner princes in Peiping planned to hold a welcome meeting for me, but I have declined. If the princes have any opinions, they can come to discuss them at any time. Whether Zhangjia will accompany me was not discussed. The tasks assigned to the two are different, and there is no need to travel together. As for the Japanese Matsushita Takayoshi convening a meeting of various princes in Dolon in late last month, which failed, I have also heard about it, but the true situation is still unclear. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Huang Shaoxiong telegraphed the Chahar Provincial Government tonight, reporting that he will depart on the 27th. Wu Heling plans to leave Peiping tomorrow. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Supervisor Bai Rui telegraphed Prince De and various league and banner princes, saying that the central government has now sent Minister Huang to Mongolia to promote autonomy and discuss national defense, which concerns the major plan for the frontier. It is hoped that you will meet with sincerity and express your difficulties as much as possible. Huang is a respected elder of the revolution, who has always been concerned with supporting the weak and small. As long as it does not hinder the central system, he will certainly be able to accommodate it. Rui is concerned about the difficulties of the times and cares about his homeland, so he respectfully presents this telegram, hoping for your kind attention. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Mongolian representatives in Peiping visited Zhangjia today and issued a warning against his obstruction of Mongolian autonomy. Zhang refused to meet with them. The representatives then went to the Mongolian Fellow Countrymen's Association to hold a meeting and decided to issue a written warning to Zhangjia: (1) He must not obstruct the Mongolian autonomy movement again; (2) He is refused entry into Mongolia to preach. (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhangjia previously sent Li Shoushan, the director of the general affairs department, and Gong Ziwan, the director of the propaganda department, to inspect the situation of Inner Mongolian autonomy in the Silingol and Ulanqab Leagues. Gong and Li sent a letter to Peiping reporting that the situation of Inner Mongolian autonomy is quite complicated, and the opinions of the princes are extremely inconsistent. Zhang will depart after Gong and Li's investigation and negotiation have yielded results. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Huang Fu visited Huang Shaoxiong this afternoon to discuss matters related to Inner Mongolian autonomy. Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian have changed their departure date from Peiping to the 27th. Xu Yongchang is scheduled to return to Taiyuan tomorrow morning. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Peiping) According to representatives who participated in the Bailing Temple Conference, the outline of the Inner Mongolian autonomous government organization has 36 articles in total. The Mongolians claim to have no background. Prince Yun and Prince De will serve as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. The organization of various departments will be jointly managed by young people and princes. The princely system will still be retained. In the event of international military and diplomatic affairs, the central government will be requested to preside. The Panchen Lama is currently stationed at Bailing Temple and has established an office. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Wu Heling stated that the purpose of Mongolia's demand for autonomy is to resist foreign aggression and seek survival. The methods are: (1) cooperation between the local and central governments; (2) cooperation between leagues and banners and provinces and counties; and (3) cooperation between princes and commoners. Under the guidance of the central government, local autonomy will be implemented. Before the Bailing Temple Conference opened on September 28, the Japanese, in order to gain the upper hand, convened an East Mongolian conference in Dolon on September 25. Matsushita Takayoshi, the head of the Japanese special affairs agency in Rehe, and others participated. At the same time, notices were issued inviting princes from Western Mongolia to attend, but none went. As a result, the Bailing Temple Conference was held. The main figure at this conference was Prince Yun Duan Wangchuk, the league leader of Bailing Temple; Prince De was secondary. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Peiping) The issue of bandit suppression in eastern Hebei has progressed smoothly since the departure of the security team. Currently, various bandit gangs are concentrated in Funing County and are surrendering one after another. Therefore, the security team's attack has also slowed down slightly. Bandit leaders Qi Wenping, Hu Yutian, and others went to Shanhaiguan on the 24th to meet with Otogawa, the Japanese garrison commander. Otogawa stated that the security team has begun its attack, and the gangs can surrender at their own discretion, or they can concentrate in a suitable location and not disturb the war zone again. Qi and others left Shanhaiguan that night for Jinzhou. The small leaders of various bandit gangs are at a loss, hoping that the Hebei Provincial Government will make a decision. If the bandits can surrender and automatically hand over their firearms, they can be allowed to reform themselves, otherwise they will be suppressed. In general, the issue of banditry in eastern Hebei will soon come to an end. However, if the gangs that do not surrender and concentrate in a suitable location are not fundamentally resolved, they will still be a hidden danger in the future. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Changli: A reporter returned to Changli from the front line by horse on the afternoon of the 25th. Currently, the bandits in Funing have been surrounded by the Dou, Zhou, and Liu units. Zhou's unit advanced to the eastern foot of Gold Mountain on the 25th and completed contact with Dou's unit. The bandits, surrounded for many days, have no resistance. In order to care for the people of Funing City, the authorities are now using peaceful methods to resolve the situation. The bandits, knowing they are at the end of their rope, have expressed their willingness to surrender. Liu Zuozhou sent representatives into the city, and it is said that the content of the negotiations was quite satisfactory. The Dou and Zhou units are still advancing at an opportune moment, hoping to resolve the situation soon. Judging from the current situation, it can be concluded within three to five days.

<h3 id="e7">Supplementary Measures for the Preparation Procedures of the Municipal Assembly; Executive Yuan Orders the Ministry of Interior to Issue a Circular for Strict Implementation; Also Revises the Supplementary Measures for the Preparation of the County Assembly <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The outline of local autonomy was stipulated in the Founding Program long ago. As for the detailed rules for implementation, the Ministry of Interior had drafted two principles for the preparation procedures of the Municipal Assembly and the County Assembly, and they were approved by the central government and issued to various provinces and cities for strict implementation. However, due to the limitations of the environment, very few provinces and cities complied. Since Huang Shaoxiong became the head of the Ministry of Interior, in order to adapt to the special circumstances of various provinces and cities regarding local autonomy, the Ministry of Interior's Department of Civil Affairs initiated supplementary measures for the preparation procedures of the County Assembly and the Municipal Assembly in May of last year and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The Executive Yuan considered this matter of great importance and forwarded it to the central government for review and approval. The central government also considered this matter to be related to the issue of local autonomy and of great importance, requiring careful consideration. Therefore, it was not until August of this year that the supplementary measures for the preparation procedures of the two assemblies were approved. However, according to the implementation date of the two supplementary measures, it was October of this year. The Ministry of Interior considered that the time was too short to implement them and submitted another request to the Executive Yuan for instructions. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has approved it a few days ago, ordering the Ministry of Interior to first issue a circular to various provinces and cities for strict implementation of the supplementary measures for the preparation procedures of the Municipal Assembly. As for the supplementary measures for the preparation procedures of the County Assembly, they will be postponed due to the environment and time constraints in the inland provinces, and the Ministry of Interior will be ordered to revise the supplementary measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval before issuing a circular for strict implementation.

<p>(Peiping) A telegram from Dihua reports that Sheng Shicai's troops have returned to Turpan. 5,000 troops have arrived in southern Turpan. Ma Zhongying, seeing that Hami is difficult to defend, has a tendency to retreat southward. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Peng Zhaoxian, the special inspector of Xinjiang, telegraphed friends in Nanjing, saying that the southern Xinjiang area was previously incited by Ma Zhongying's troops and was somewhat chaotic. Now, Ma's troops stationed in Turpan and Shanshan have been surrounded by provincial troops, and their elite troops have been eliminated. Ma, realizing that he is isolated and exhausted, has sent representatives to the province to ask for peace. I plan to return to Nanjing after the Eurasia Aviation Corporation resumes flights to report everything to the central government. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A dispatch from Tacheng states that the repeated incidents in Xinjiang have not yet subsided, and the people are suffering. Recently, the war between Sheng and Ma has started again, and the local area is becoming increasingly devastated. It is heard that comrades from the Northwest Association in the local authorities, seeing that the internal strife continues, the people are suffering, and foreign troubles are looming, have warned all parties that if anyone violates the central government and harms the local area, they will resolutely oppose it and will gather armed civilians from Tacheng, Suilai, and Zhenxi to quell the rebellion together. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A military agency received a telegram from Sheng Shicai stating that Ma Zhongying secretly plotted a rebellion this time, endangering the local area. After sending troops to attack him fiercely, his strength was reduced by more than half. Knowing that he could not win, he sent personnel to the province to ask for peace. The war in Xinjiang has ended. However, Ma is fickle and is still under strict surveillance. The Turpan area has been taken over by provincial troops. Currently, Hami is designated as the garrison area for Ma's troops. Whether this is agreed upon is still under negotiation. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Peiping) A scholar discussed three opinions on appeasing Inner Mongolia: (1) Autonomy: Recognizing that the foundation of autonomy must be built on the common people, and that autonomy cannot be achieved by the calls of a few nobles and princes alone. This should be paid attention to. (2) Early Preparation: The scope of Inner Mongolia is extremely wide, including the provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar. Regardless of the true nature of the autonomy movement, full military preparations must be made early, otherwise, in the event of an emergency, not only will the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan have no guarantee, but Jin and Hebei will also lose their foundation. (3) Influencing Youth: The government should not only pay attention to a few princes at this time, but should also influence the general youth and properly arrange them.

He has been doing scientific surveys in the northwest of China for 48 years and has been treated with love and respect by Chinese officials and people. He is determined to complete this road completely in a short period of time to repay their kindness. Fu Zuoyi said that when this road is completed, Suiyuan's commerce will prosper, which will have a great impact, and expressed a warm welcome to the team.

<h3 id="e19">The Change of the French Left-Wing Cabinet and the Fate of the Gold Standard <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— By You</p>
<p>The French Daladier cabinet, due to the failure of the French central government's budget balancing plan to pass in the Chamber of Deputies, resigned en masse on the 24th. The Daladier cabinet's fiscal policy was based on tax increases and reduced government spending as a prerequisite, and resolutely rejected the adoption of inflation. After the change of the French cabinet, what kind of changes will occur in the French finances, especially the fate of the French gold standard? It seems to be a major issue in the current global economic panic.</p>
<p>The French Radical Party's Daladier cabinet, since succeeding Herriot and Poincaré one after another on January 31st of this year, has been in power for only nine months. During his tenure, Mr. Daladier has consistently adhered to the principle of supporting monetary contraction and maintaining the gold standard in all economic policies related to finance and currency. The formation of the European Gold Standard Alliance in conjunction with Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium is clear evidence of this. However, the collapse of his cabinet has other significant reasons. According to the Havas Paris dispatch on the 24th, one of the provisions of the fiscal bill submitted by the government stipulated that a fixed income of 6% tax should be levied from public and private sector employees, regardless of salary or benefits. However, the majority of the Socialist Party firmly expressed their opposition, making a compromise difficult. The majority party in the French Chamber of Deputies that supports the government is composed of the Radical Party and the Socialist Party. Now that the majority of the Socialist Party cannot cooperate with the government, and the government regards its policy as having no room for hesitation, the cabinet can only resign en masse. Therefore, the essence of this cabinet crisis lies here and not elsewhere.</p>
<p>From another aspect of this cabinet crisis, the collapse of the current French cabinet authorities does not necessarily mean that France is about to adopt inflation. Because, based on the national conditions of France, the people have not forgotten the pain of the devaluation of the franc after the war, and the political parties do not dare to make such a proposal that is clearly contrary to public opinion. Therefore, judging from the general situation, the question of whether the French gold standard can be maintained does not seem to be triggered by the change of cabinet. Although French finances are in a time of panic, the deficit in next year's revenue and expenditure will reach 600 billion francs (currently equivalent to about 75 million pounds in English gold). In the future, when a new cabinet is established, it may be possible to adopt inflation, but this cannot be predicted as an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>The fact that France and the gold standards of various European countries still stand today is indeed a remarkable event. However, the future determinant of the fate of the gold standard does not lie in the changes in domestic politics, but only in the changes in American monetary policy. The day before yesterday, the US president clearly announced during his broadcast that the United States will raise prices. The means are, on the one hand, to buy newly produced gold domestically, and on the other hand, to manipulate exchange rates in the world's major financial markets. As a result, the US dollar will inevitably tend to fall, and then prices can be raised. In addition to the English gold following suit, the French franc will inevitably suffer significant pressure. In addition, in the past three years, French export trade has decreased by 50%. If it were not for the French colonies to absorb its surplus commodities to ease the outbreak of the crisis, the French gold standard would have been unsustainable. Therefore, as of today, the fate of the franc is almost tied to how the two major forces of the gold pound and the gold yuan compete for supremacy in the world currency market. This is what can be predicted.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Urgent Legal and Political Crisis: Efforts to Resolve It; Sarraut Willing to Attempt Forming a New Cabinet; Daladier Likely to Head the Army or Foreign Affairs; Flandin's Position Increasingly Precarious; Threat of Financial Dictatorship <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After lengthy consultations with his friends, Sarraut has indicated to the French President his willingness to undertake the formation of a cabinet. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French President this afternoon urged Sarraut to assume the premiership. Sarraut is a senator and served as Minister of the Navy in the Daladier cabinet. During the financial panic of 1928, Premier Poincaré relied on him as his right-hand man. It is widely expected that Daladier will head the Army or Foreign Affairs in the new government. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French political crisis not only endangers the gold standard but also the democratic system. The general public is questioning whether France can find a strong leader. The financial failures of the Herriot, Painlevé, and Daladier cabinets demonstrate the impossibility of joint governance by the Radical and Socialist parties. Daladier's political skill and strategy have earned him widespread recognition, but the majority of Socialist deputies, led by Blum, while internally divided, do not support the gold standard and favor inflation, consistently ignoring Daladier's arguments about the necessity of balancing the budget. The only solution now seems to be to form a new cabinet with parties other than the Socialist Party, but such a government may not last long. A significant part of France's financial difficulties stems from taxpayers refusing to pay income taxes. A certain parliamentarian, in a recent debate, estimated that unpaid income taxes are approximately twice the budget deficit. Flandin has not yet been significantly affected, but his future is quite concerning. If the cabinet fails again over the budget proposal, it may lead to a financial dictatorship. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome The fall of the Daladier government has caused great alarm in Italian political circles. It is believed that the European situation will completely change. With the French right-wing coming into power, it is feared that the French government will adopt a more assertive attitude towards diplomatic and political issues, eliminating any hope for Franco-German understanding. Without German cooperation, the continuation of the Disarmament Conference is absolutely hopeless. Italian newspapers state that Daladier's failure and the possible decline of the franc will have unfavorable impacts on the overall European situation. However, political circles view the French cabinet crisis as further proof of the unsuitability of the parliamentary system to the times. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Disarmament Leadership Meeting; Chairman Henderson Suggests: General Committee Adjourn Until December 4th; Core Leadership Continues Work on Draft Treaty; US and Italy Oppose Indefinite Postponement; Britain Forced to Change Initial Stance <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) At 3:40 PM today, during the Disarmament Conference leadership meeting, Henderson suggested that the General Committee should be extended, but no later than December 4th, stating that during the extension, the core leadership could continue drafting the final version of the convention. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Although British officials favor a long-term postponement of the Disarmament Conference, the British government cannot but change its intentions due to the opposition of Italy and the United States. Most relevant to this matter was the visit of the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to the Foreign Office yesterday. Last week, the British government's intention leaned towards a long-term postponement, but after exchanging views with continental countries, especially France, it now intends to continue the Disarmament Conference's work, albeit on a smaller scale and with a temporary mechanism instead of its current structure. When the Italian Ambassador, Grandi, visited the Foreign Office, he clearly stated that the Italian government hoped the Disarmament Conference would continue its efforts, and the shorter the postponement, the better. Sources here explain the Roman government's intention as follows: the Four-Power Pact is currently being tested, and if the Disarmament Conference is postponed indefinitely, the treaty will be proven invalid, and the success of Italian policy will be affected, which is something the Italian government does not want to hear. As for the United States, it also hopes that the Disarmament Conference will continue its work so that the United States can continue to maintain its influence and mission, along with its observer status. This would not be possible with an indefinite postponement. President Roosevelt personally stated this. Britain is well aware of the views of Italy and the United States, so although British officials favor a long-term postponement, given the situation on all sides, they cannot but change their initial stance.

<p>(Berlin) With the German Reichstag elections approaching, tens of thousands of Nazi Party members gathered at the sports field today for an election rally. Hitler delivered a speech at the venue, which was broadcast via radio. Gatherings were held in over sixty locations throughout Berlin, all of which could hear the speech. First, Propaganda Minister Goebbels spoke, saying that the German nation's loyalty to Hitler is trustworthy and unsurpassed today. Then, Hitler spoke, saying that the government will strive to fulfill its responsibilities and will never yield. He continued, "Why does the world not give us peace? The greatest suffering Germany has endured comes from the Treaty of Versailles. In the National Socialist revolution, no more than fifty Germans were sacrificed, but they were all shameless individuals. As for those sacrificed by the Treaty of Versailles, it is no fewer than several each year." Hitler also said that foreign rumors about Germany practicing tyranny are completely unfounded. Hitler said, "Our party's enemies hate us; this is our only misfortune. Germans who flee abroad publish brown books to slander the German government. These exiles are all scoundrels, and their actions of defaming the country through printed materials cannot be tolerated by any government. Germany, to preserve its reputation, must remember what Germans fought for during the Great War, which was to protect Germany's honor. The movement to ostracize Germany is an intolerable insult. If the words used to criticize German cabinet members were applied to the British Privy Councillor Baldwin, would the British people be able to tolerate it?" Hitler concluded by saying that Germany's ambition is to restore friendly relations between all nations and does not want their feuds to remain unresolved forever. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Canadian Nickel Exports Increase Significantly; For Use in Manufacturing Arms <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Ottawa A representative of the German I.G. Farben company arrived here today to purchase a large quantity of Canadian nickel. It is claimed that the company is currently developing a nickel plating method. Nickel is a key material for manufacturing arms, and exports have increased significantly recently. In the first six months of this year, a total of 513,000 dan (approximately 112 pounds per dan) of nickel were exported, compared to only 128,000 dan during the same period last year. Germany imported a total of 2,557 dan in the first half of last year, but this has more than doubled in the first half of this year. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e25">US New Monetary Policy: Gradual Inflation; Fluctuating Gold Prices; A New Speculative Frenzy in the Market <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Tonight, local bankers and market participants plunged into complete confusion upon hearing news from Washington that some radical inflationists had interpreted the President's new monetary plan as a practical move towards inflation. It is reported that inflationists within Congress, along with representatives from various cotton and agricultural groups, met with Senator Thomas to discuss the government's new plan. After Thomas explained his views, everyone agreed that the President's intention in controlling the monetary plan was simply to implement orderly inflation. As a result, a resolution was adopted supporting the government's new monetary policy. Therefore, market traders hold differing opinions on the fluctuations of gold prices after the initial announcement of domestic gold prices. Some still insist on their original claim that gold prices will not fluctuate significantly, but others also say that the inflationists' resolution is not meaningless. Furthermore, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace announced a processing tax of 25 cents per bushel on corn products, including cornstarch, corn flakes, cornmeal, corn grits, and syrup, further increasing the confusion. In addition, Wallace ordered the collection of opinions to determine whether the plan to purchase $350 million worth of pork, grains, and other foods to distribute to the unemployed would raise prices, and also reduce the extent to which the public cuts back on consumption, as Wallace has received many complaints that the wheat processing tax actually reduces consumption. Today's various government actions have sparked a new speculative frenzy. More cautious traders say that the market will be chaotic unless opinions can be somewhat unified before the market opens.

<h3 id="e26">President Pays Attention to Silver Reserves: Formulating Practical Procedures <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt has now launched the gold plan and will immediately turn his attention to silver. Congressmen who advocate for the restoration of silver coinage say that President Roosevelt is considering the silver issue and will hold a meeting soon to formulate practical procedures. Senator Pittman told people today, expounding on the urgency of the silver issue. Others involved with silver hope that the authorities will set the price of silver at 90 cents per ounce, placing gold and silver on an equal footing. President Roosevelt supports maintaining silver, but has not yet decided on the best way to achieve this goal. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Fixed Official Price for Mined Gold: Large-Scale Purchases Will Begin Immediately <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) This morning, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) announced that, in accordance with President Roosevelt's new monetary plan, it would set the official purchase price for newly mined gold at $31.64 per ounce of pure gold. This price is $1.55 higher than the Treasury Department's recent price for gold sold abroad and 23 cents higher than the price of gold in London. Based on the London-New York exchange rate of $4.78, the price of gold in London is only $31.13. It is because the RFC is a corporate organization and is not subject to the gold standard law that President Roosevelt specifically ordered the RFC and the Treasury Department to buy and sell gold. In contrast, the Treasury Department, due to the law stipulating that the government must purchase gold at a fixed price, may be suspected of violating the law if it sets a new price. The gold price announced today was decided in a meeting at the Treasury Department between RFC Chairman Jesse Jones, Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson, and Agricultural Adjustment Administration Director Morgenthau. Jones claimed that the purchase price of newly mined gold would be paid with 90-day bonds issued by the RFC. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(New York) Today, American markets and businesses nationwide are eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's measures regarding the gold standard. The actions of President Roosevelt and monetary authorities before the market opens tomorrow are the sole topic of discussion among bankers and brokers here. RFC Chairman Jones and other related personnel will meet at the Treasury Department in Washington tomorrow morning at around 9:00 AM to decide on the first official price for newly mined gold. All parties now recognize that this new official price is the first practical indication of the government's intentions and therefore attach great importance to it. Some bankers and brokers in New York have even temporarily leased telephone lines in order to obtain the news first. Today, the Treasury Department has indicated that the RFC will stop transporting gold to foreign markets after purchasing it, and stated that the government's official price may be higher than the world price, so miners do not need to transport gold abroad.

<h3 id="e29">Moderate Tariff Increases to Encourage Domestic Price Increases <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, in order to encourage price increases, President Roosevelt ordered the implementation of the tariff regulations in the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). According to the Act, the President is authorized to impose compensatory taxes on raw materials, increase tariffs on other goods, or completely prohibit imports if domestic products are at risk from foreign competition. President Roosevelt now believes that domestic goods are facing excessive foreign competition, so he wants to selectively increase tariffs or completely prohibit imports after special investigations. This investigation will be initiated by NIRA Administrator Johnson within a few days. Today, officials at the NIRA admitted that the NIRA, like inflationary methods, cannot cure all ills. Therefore, if the industrial sector is to continue adding employees, increasing wages, and finding markets, the government must give the plan its full force. Since the government decided to resume purchasing gold, the possibility of increasing import tariffs on many manufactured goods has arisen. The outside world also interprets this move differently. Some bankers in New York believe that this can raise prices and no longer suppress the gold standard. A banker in Washington said that the President clearly wants to abandon the method of suppressing the gold standard and wants to increase tariffs so that the gold standard can at least remain at its current level. However, others also say that this move has nothing to do with currency and is only because the progress of the recovery plan is too slow. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Impact on War Debts: Differing Speculation Abroad <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London). There is much speculation on both sides of the Atlantic about whether President Roosevelt's new monetary policy will have an adverse effect on the Anglo-American war debt negotiations. According to a New York dispatch to Washington, the hope for a permanent resolution of the Anglo-American war debt has disappeared because the dollar is unstable, and negotiations are pointless at present. But practically speaking, it seems too early to predict the impact of the President's policy today. Londoners believe that while the new monetary policy may cause fluctuations, President Roosevelt's goal is to establish a dollar that does not change its purchasing power or debt repayment capacity in the next thirty years. No one wants drastic fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate either. Therefore, superficial fluctuations may not be enough to prevent the resolution of the war debt issue. Although bankers within the United States have expressed dismay at President Roosevelt's actions, the American banking community in London does not hold this view. They believe that the new policy is a step towards the establishment of an American exchange equalization fund (and that, when the fund is established in the future) it will de facto create stability in the Anglo-American exchange rate.

<h3 id="e31">Farmers' Strike for Sales: Struggle for Timely Purchases Lacks Vitality <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Reno, President of the Farmers' Holiday Association, criticized President Roosevelt's monetary policy, saying it was purely fanciful, and the farmers' struggle would not cease until their demands were guaranteed. Nebraska Governor Bryan also spoke out for the farmers, saying that the farmers' throats are currently being cut. This shows the tension of the farmers' emotions. Farmers' pickets are currently prohibiting grain trucks from traveling, and although some still anticipate that the farmers' strike will not greatly affect the food supply of the cities, all believe that the success or failure of the recovery movement largely depends on this issue. It is heard that farmers everywhere are currently unwilling to shop at stores that display the Blue Eagle recovery emblem. Furthermore, stores have been hit hard by the large increase in wages. It is widely believed that the "buy now" movement has now lost its vitality. President Roosevelt has ordered an immediate investigation into market prices, and the authorities will likely strictly prohibit hoarding and profiteering and immediately provide farmers with loans secured by grains. General public opinion believes that President Roosevelt is now being gradually forced towards an inflationary policy. Many political forces are driving him to do so, and the greatest force is the farmers, who deeply believe that the only way to save the countryside is through a cheap dollar. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Hirota Emphasizes the Selection of an Ambassador to the United States; Debuchi Scheduled to Return to Japan <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a cable received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador to the United States Debuchi Katsuji is scheduled to leave the United States on November 24th to return to Japan. It has now been confirmed that Debuchi's resignation after returning home is certain. Foreign Minister Hirota is currently considering candidates for the successor ambassador. It is heard that his selection policy seems to aim for the Second Washington Conference in 1935. It is heard that the Foreign Minister's views are generally as follows: The Second Washington Conference will discuss naval disarmament, and Japan is also prepared to attend the conference and adjust Japanese-American relations. The new Ambassador to the United States must be qualified to handle all of these tasks. Therefore, the Foreign Minister intends to select a first-class individual who is knowledgeable about the situation in the Far East and Japanese-American relations, and who possesses skillful means and high intelligence. Talents who meet the above conditions can be sought from political, financial, and other circles, and are not limited to diplomats. (Nichi Ren Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The responsibilities of the Ambassador to the United States who will succeed Ambassador Debuchi are, needless to say, very heavy. Especially since the Manchurian Incident, there has been a need to repair the broken Japanese-American relations in a satisfactory manner. At the same time, the new Ambassador must undertake preparatory work for the next Disarmament Conference in 1935 and must attend the conference as one of the Empire's main plenipotentiaries. The responsibilities are very heavy. Foreign Minister Hirota is carefully considering the selection of a successor. It is heard that the Foreign Minister is evaluating candidates based on the following guidelines: (1) The successor Ambassador to the United States must be someone who is endorsed by everyone inside and outside the country and need not be a diplomat within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (2) To refresh the personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and create a new spirit between Japan and the United States, experienced veterans should be avoided, and promising newcomers should be adopted. From this point of view, Ambassador to Germany Nagai and Ambassador to Italy Yoshida, who are so-called veterans, cannot be considered newcomers. Minister to the Netherlands Saito Hiroshi can be considered a young and promising diplomat, but there is a need to consider the future. Matsuoka Yosuke, outside the Ministry, also has shortcomings and cannot be considered the most suitable candidate. As a result, it is also possible that Sugimura Yotaro, who is knowledgeable about international affairs, may be appointed, as Minister Sugimura has served as Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations for many years, and internationally he is recognized for his consummate personality and skilled ability. Ambassador Debuchi also sent a telegram to Tokyo yesterday, saying that he would depart San Francisco on November 24th and arrive in Tokyo on December 10th. (Dentsu Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Minseito's Kobashi, Tomita, Tawara, and others believe that to open up the current extraordinary situation and uphold constitutional politics, the political parties must cooperate with each other. As a result of repeated negotiations with Seiyukai members, it has been decided that Minseito's Tomita and Tawara will meet with Seiyukai's Kuhara and Shimada within the next few days to exchange concrete opinions on the issue of political party merger. However, there is no understanding between the leaders of the two parties on this issue, and whether its future can be realized is still questionable. (Nichi Ren Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of political party alliance is becoming more concrete after discussions between Seiyukai's Kuhara and Shimada and Minseito's Tomita and Tawara. Therefore, Education Minister Hatoyama also visited Prime Minister Suzuki at 8:30 AM on the 25th to conduct important consultations on the policies that the party headquarters should take regarding this issue, and left around 9:00 AM. Chief Secretary Shimada also visited Suzuki after 9:00 AM to report in detail on the situation of the two parties' discussions and exchange of opinions and discuss countermeasures. On the other hand, Secretary General Yamaguchi also visited the Education Minister at the same time to discuss this issue and then consulted with Shimada at the headquarters. On the Seiyukai side, it is advocated that they jointly study national policies, restore the credibility of political parties, and work together to open up the current situation and seek political party alliance. The aim is to make opinions as consistent as possible from the party's standpoint, but the so-called national one-party system cannot be endorsed. Its executives all tend to hold this view. Therefore, an atmosphere of political party alliance is being created with the aforementioned meaning. If the Minseito understands the true spirit of this, it will not hesitate to cooperate. However, Minseito's Tomita and Tawara have also reported the details of this case to their top executives. In order to seek their understanding, Ohara Osamu, Kawasaki, Raimogi, Masada, Machida and others summoned a meeting on the 25th, but it failed to materialize due to various reasons. Within the Minseito, regarding this plan for the two parties to negotiate, it is said that it is still the Seiyukai's internal strategy and that there is a fear that it will turn into a movement to overthrow the current cabinet and promote fascist tendencies, so they all take a negative attitude towards it. Except for Tomita and Tawara, the other members of the Minseito are all making pessimistic observations on the future of the issue. The current Minseito is only acting as a gathering for exchanging opinions, and there are still considerable twists and turns in the future of the issue. (Nichi Ren Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The so-called political party alliance movement launched by the Seiyukai and Minseito has recently resurfaced. Although the military authorities outwardly approve of its objectives, they feel that it is difficult to realize and are paying attention to its future development. The political party alliance movement was originally intended to address the lack of capacity and loss of credibility of the existing political parties by forming a rational alliance to enhance their capabilities, regain their credibility, and hope to rectify the current situation. If this situation is the true intention, then its objectives are extremely commendable. However, the leaders of the existing political parties are still blinded by traditional customs and lack foresight regarding the general trend. Even with this movement today, it is difficult to suddenly expect its effects. On the one hand, it is said that the reason why political parties are moving to unite is as a pressure tactic against the military authorities, or as a means for the Seiyukai to restrain the Minseito. If it contains such impure motives, then its actions will ultimately fail, which can be easily asserted. In short, the existing political parties must completely abandon the traditional party interests, party strategies, and all such ingrained habits, and they must resolve to serve the country and strive to achieve their objectives. If this is not the case, then the success of the movement will be absolutely impossible. (Nichi Ren Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to recent news from Chinese newspapers, the Japanese government has decided to abolish the "Manchu Government," annexing Manchuria into Japanese territory, and has set January 1 of next year as the date for implementation. This claim has been denied by Japanese officials and other figures, and foreigners who are interested in politics in Japan do not believe this claim or pay much attention to it. However, while Japan's annexation of Manchuria is not credible in the current environment, there will be considerable changes and developments within "Manchukuo" in the near future, at least. There are two recent facts that are particularly relevant to this matter: one is that Zhao Xinbo, President of the "Manchukuo" Legislative Yuan, recently came to Japan to study Japanese constitutional politics and the organization of its parliament; and the other is the appointment of Doihara as the head of the Shenyang Special Affairs Agency on October 17. When Zhao Xinbo came to Japan, he told reporters that "Manchukuo" had decided to adopt a constitutional monarchy sooner or later, with Puyi as king. Therefore, they will be studying the Japanese Imperial House Law together. Zhao will stay in Japan for about a year and then return to Manchukuo to draft a new constitution based on his research in Japan. From this event, it can be seen that the administrative organization of "Manchukuo" is likely to be changed to a constitutional monarchy, but it is not Japan annexing Manchuria. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchu Government" will implement a centralized system from next year, stipulating the abolition of the five-province system and dividing the provinces into several small administrative districts under the direct jurisdiction of the central government. (Reuter, 25th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Yesterday, the Chinese Eastern Railway police arrested five employees of the railway. The names of four of them have already been announced: three Russians and one Chinese named Pan Chenghao (transliteration). It is alleged that the five are communists and held meetings to plot disturbances. When the railway police went to arrest them, the five tried to prevent them from entering and attempted to destroy documents, but failed. Many documents were seized on the spot. The five are now under strict interrogation, and it is hoped that new communist plans can be learned from their confessions. (October 25, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese-run Harbin Times today published an editorial commenting on relations between Russia and Japan, urging Russia to stop its Far Eastern policy, as it causes disputes in the Far East and greatly hinders Japan. If Soviet Russia abandons its Far Eastern policy and retreats to the Urals, Japan can protect its own security, and the people of the Far East can escape their extreme suffering. If Soviet Russia refuses to retreat, Japan must take all kinds of precautions to defend its territory.

<p>Singapore Since October 17, when the government of the Federated Malay States imposed a tax of 15 cents per picul on imported rice, it has caused anxiety among the Chinese here, as the Chinese account for 65 percent of the total population of Malaya. According to Chinese leaders, it is unwise for the government to suddenly increase taxes at a time when wages are low and unemployment is still serious. The Director of Agriculture said in his report that the rice tax burden per person per month is only 7 cents, but Chinese rice importers say that customs duties, freight, warehouse rent, and the increased rice tax amount to at least 30 cents. Chinese and other Asians residing here are preparing to jointly petition the authorities to repeal this tax until the Federated Malay States can become self-sufficient, and at the same time, request the government to subsidize Chinese farmers and allow Chinese farmers to enjoy the same rights as local farmers.

<h3 id="e89">Senior Northern Route Generals Gu Zhutong and Others Take Office; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Presents the Seal and Instructs Them to Complete the Bandit Suppression Mission; He Jian Delivers a Speech Stating That Bandit Suppression is the Central Issue of the Era <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Gu Zhutong, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Army, and Jiang Dingwen, the Commander of the Northern Route Forward, after receiving their appointments, first took office and departed for the Nancheng-Nanfeng area to supervise the suppression. They returned to the province a few days ago and held a supplementary oath-taking ceremony today (23rd). Zhao Qilu, the Chief of Staff of the Northern Route Army Headquarters, and Liu Xing, the Commander of the Northern Route Forward, also took office at the same time. On that day, personnel from various military and political organs first held an expanded memorial week in the auditorium of the Provincial Government. Then, Xiong Shihui announced that they would wait for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to attend. Chiang was inspecting in Nancheng Chongren and returned to the province via Fuzhou, arriving at 10:30 AM. After Chiang attended, he led the ceremony as usual and then personally presented the seal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route, which was issued by the National Government, to Gu Zhutong, and the seal of the Commander of the Northern Route Forward to Jiang Dingwen. Next, Gu, Jiang, Liu, and Zhao took the oath in order. After the oath, Chiang delivered instructions, saying, "The bandit suppression work in Jiangxi is now the key to the survival of the Chinese nation. Commander Gu, Commander Jiang, Commander Liu, and Chief of Staff Zhao, when the people of Jiangxi Province are in dire straits and the entire nation is in a critical state of survival, you are taking on the important task of suppressing bandits. This grand ceremony is of great significance because Jiangxi is the center of bandit suppression, especially the Northern Route. If the military operations for bandit suppression in Jiangxi can be successful, the other provinces will not be a problem. I hope that after Gu, Jiang, Liu, and Zhao take office, they will rectify the troops and work hard to suppress the bandits so that the evil bandits can be thoroughly eliminated in the shortest possible time, the bandit suppression mission can be completed, and the Chinese nation can be revived." Then, He Jian delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, saying, "Bandit suppression is the central issue of the era. The central issue of the first year of the Republic of China was the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. The central issue of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China was the Northern Expedition. The central issue now is bandit suppression. Being able to solve the central issue of an era can complete the mission of an era. Being able to solve the central issue of an era can solve all the difficulties of the country and all the pain of society. Bandit suppression is the key to national revival. Bandits are a disease in the heart of the country. Without bandit suppression, we cannot resist Japan. Without bandit suppression, we cannot build. Without bandit suppression, we cannot revive the countryside. Without bandit suppression, we cannot unite internally. If bandit suppression succeeds, the nation will have a way out. If bandit suppression succeeds, it will be the first step towards national revival. Now the main force of the bandits is concentrated in eastern Jiangxi. The Northern Route Army has the important mission of annihilating the main force of the bandits. Today, Commander Gu, Commander Jiang, Commander Liu, and Chief of Staff Zhao took office, which is of great significance because the Northern Route is the focus of bandit suppression, and bandit suppression is the central issue of the era and the key to the era. I would like to represent all the officers and soldiers of the Western Route Army to wish Commander Gu, Commander Jiang, and Commander Liu victory in bandit suppression, and I am willing to work with them under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to complete the bandit suppression mission." Gu Zhutong then gave a response, saying, "The red bandits took advantage of the natural disasters and foreign insults that came one after another to spread poison and wreak havoc. The people in the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei cannot survive and cannot die. They obstruct national construction, restrain the central government from resisting insults, and hinder the progress of society, plunging the entire nation into eternal destruction. Therefore, the Central Government has determined that bandit suppression is the most important task at present and is devoting the nation's efforts to it. From now on, I will work with friendly forces under the guidance of Chairman Chiang to work hard to eliminate the evil red bandits and live up to the expectations of the officers and the people." The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM with music. Gu Zhutong hosted a banquet today (23rd) to connect with the leaders of the senior military, political, and party circles in the province. It is reported that the Northern Route Headquarters has no less than 200,000 people under its command and is full of elites. After the general attack, the southeastern bandit areas of Jiangxi should be recovered in a few days. (October 23)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Inner Mongolian Prince De Wang Expresses Desire for Self-Preservation | Huang and Zhao Scheduled to Go to Guihua First | <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The protagonist of the Inner Mongolian autonomy movement is Demchugdongrub, Vice-Chief of the Xilingol League. He is young and ambitious. After loudly advocating for autonomy, he often speaks of Genghis Khan's achievements, with a strong intention to follow in his ancestor's footsteps. He went to Japan in his youth and visited Ping once this spring, then went to Hankou to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, and met with key figures in Nanjing's central government. He currently has only over a thousand guns and less than two thousand soldiers, with very limited strength and shallow prestige. The various princes of Inner Mongolia hold a wait-and-see attitude toward the autonomy he advocates. Therefore, he has convened several meetings, but few attended. According to someone who personally attended the Bailingmiao meeting, the meeting convened in Bailingmiao starting on the ninth of this month was instigated by Prince De Wang alone. A total of 65 representatives from various leagues and banners attended, including two who traveled from Rehe. These two were Mongols from a puppet organization and are worthy of attention. One of them is a high-ranking military officer, which is particularly important. At the meeting, they vigorously advocated for autonomy, giving the meeting a political dimension. However, the representatives of various leagues and banners mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude and suggested contacting the central government representatives before making a decision. Therefore, all proposals were reserved and postponed for discussion. As for the telegrams sent to the central government requesting autonomy, they were all drafted and sent by Prince De Wang outside the meeting and did not represent the consensus of the majority. Before the opening of the Bailingmiao meeting, Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi sent representatives to dissuade the princes of various leagues and banners in Suiyuan from attending, saying that the meeting had revolutionary overtones. The princes of various leagues and banners in Suiyuan did not think so and ultimately sent representatives. Therefore, from all aspects, the Bailingmiao meeting was a re-establishment of relations among the long-divided leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia and a non-political form of unity. It cannot change the general trend of the Mongolian people due to Prince De Wang's separate affiliation. Prince De Wang once told Ge Jun that Outer Mongolia has now been annexed by Soviet Russia, and Eastern Mongolia has been transformed into the territory of "Manchukuo." The Mongols, seeing the danger of the situation, are urgently seeking self-preservation. The current demand is only for self-preservation and autonomy, and there is no unreasonable request. Diplomacy is still handled by the central government, while other internal issues are handled by Mongolian autonomy. If the central government can allow this request, there will be no objection. If not, the Mongols can easily find another way out. However, the Mongols have no intention of fighting with the government. If, unfortunately, there is an accident, the initiators will not be the Mongols. According to Prince De Wang's statement, he does not intend to absolutely betray the central government, let alone other princes. The central government initially only instructed Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan to handle the matter nearby. Song sent Xiao Zhenying to mediate. Later, considering the seriousness of the matter, the central government decided to send Huang Shaohong and Zhao Pilian to offer comfort. Huang and Zhao have arrived in Beiping one after another and decided to depart on the 26th, first to Suiyuan to meet with Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi, and then to Bailingmiao from Suiyuan. Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to Beiping today to welcome them. The Ping-Sui Railway also prepared two chartered cars for Huang and Zhao, scheduled to depart from Xizhimen at 11:50 AM on the 26th. The Living Buddha Zhangjia will not travel with Huang and others. He plans to wait for reports from Li Shoushan and Gong Shishi, who were sent to Inner Mongolia for inspection, to arrive in Beiping and understand the real situation before proceeding. Yesterday, Mr. Huang spoke with He Yingqin and Huang Fu about everything and exchanged views with Zhangjia. This morning (24th), Mongolian princes in Beiping and representatives of fellow villagers in Beiping, including Prince Namjilebaoleng of the Jerim League, Prince Alatanwazir of the Khorchin Wing Banner, Song Yongweilu of the Jeridalhan Prince Banner, Wu Bao, Acting Jasak of the Khorchin Left Front Banner of the Zhe Banner, and Amurqingletu, representative of the Jerim League Chief, and Jierge Lang, Deputy Director of the Inner Mongolia Relief Committee, visited Huang. Huang was busy, so Zhao Pilian and Li Songfeng received them separately. Huang also plans to invite various Mongolian princes and important figures in Beiping tomorrow (25th) to solicit their opinions. According to Huang, the central government has already determined the principles for Mongolian affairs and will proceed according to the central government's intentions. Huang will first go to Guihua to meet with Chairman Fu before deciding on his next steps. He plans to inspect various leagues and banners and invite the princes of various leagues and banners to meet and convey the central government's intentions, planning to stay for several weeks.

<h3 id="e91">Han Fuqu Returns to Jinan | Impressed with the North China Conference | Feng Yuxiang's Future Also Discussed <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu went to Beiping from Jinan on the 16th of this month to attend the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, to discuss North China's diplomatic, military, and political issues, and to report to He Yingqin and Huang Fu on the military and political situation in Shandong Province, and to discuss Feng Yuxiang's future and expenses. It was originally scheduled to return to Shandong around the 20th after the meeting closed. However, because he was very busy socializing in Beiping, he did not take a special train from Beiping to Nankou until late last night (22nd), and arrived in Jinan at 2:35 PM today (23rd). Those who returned with Han included Zhang Liansheng, Han Qinglin, Cheng Xixian, Chai Chunlin, and staff members. According to Han's statement, the gist was: "The North China Political Reorganization Committee meeting discussed the aftermath of the military and financial issues in North China. After Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang left the army, the military issues have come to an end for the time being. As for the aftermath, although the conference discussed it in detail, there is no definite solution. The financial difficulties are quite difficult to solve, and the military expenses are particularly tight. Most of the soldiers receive seven or eight discounts on ten months' salary per year, or have only received five months' salary by now. There is no solution for next month's military expenses, and I feel that there is not enough military spending all day long. There are rumors in Beiping that North China's finances have a total deficit of more than 18 million, but the exact figure is not yet known. However, at this meeting, everyone was sincere and the impression was quite good. North China's diplomacy, since Chairman Huang returned to Beiping, has had a considerable solution and is absolutely not a problem, unlike the difficulties in the past. Sun Dianying went to Qinghai to reclaim land, but was blocked by Ma Hongkui when passing through Ningxia. Both parties sent telegrams to Beiping, but the Military Affairs Commission has no solution for this. Sun Dianying asked the Military Affairs Commission to issue an order that the unit not be dispatched for the time being, but the Military Affairs Commission has not made a clear statement. It is heard that Sun Dianying is sending people to contact various parties and is brewing something. Regarding Mr. Feng (Yuxiang)'s future and expenses, a considerable solution has been discussed and it is planned to apply to the central government to grant him the title of Director of Afforestation and Reclamation. It can be implemented after Feng agrees. Feng's monthly expenses require tens of thousands of yuan, and it is really difficult for Shandong Province alone to provide it. Feng is a member of the National Government and a member of the Central Committee, and his expenses should be allocated by the central government. Feng lives very comfortably and has not heard of any intention to leave. Shandong only provides a small amount of thousands of yuan as relief when it is absolutely necessary. Because of the financial difficulties in the province, I requested the Military Affairs Commission to reduce the province's army during the meeting in Beiping, but the Military Affairs Commission has not made any statement on this issue. As for how to handle it, nothing has been heard yet. Although the province's finances are quite difficult, because it is directly under the central government, it was not mentioned in the Political Reorganization Committee meeting. Although North China's military and politics are so difficult, the biggest key in China is still how the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi progresses. If the suppression of the Communists has a solution, then all major events in the country will have a solution. If the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi cannot be completed in one day, domestic rectification cannot be started in one day. Therefore, the most important issue at present is still the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi. I went to Beiping from Jinan on the 16th, and the round trip took a total of eight days. In addition to attending meetings, I was receiving guests and had no free time. After a short rest in Jinan, I will go to Linyi, southern Shandong, at the end of the month to inspect county administration." (23rd)</p>

<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Eight-Province Food Conference held two group review meetings on the morning of the 23rd, and a general meeting in the afternoon to pass various proposals. It ended at 5:30 PM. Chairman Chiang was requested to give instructions by telephone. Chiang then arrived at the meeting by car from his private residence, first inspected the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government for a week, and then went to the meeting place to call the roll one by one. Then he delivered instructions, and the meeting was adjourned at 7 PM. Xiong Shi presided over a banquet for the representatives in the West Flower Hall of the Provincial Government on behalf of Chiang, and it dispersed at midnight. The important proposals passed on the 23rd are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e93">Methods to Improve Sales and Production <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>China is established by agriculture and is inherently self-sufficient in rice. However, in recent years, various coastal areas have relied on foreign grain, which is difficult to fill the gap. The central provinces have surplus production, and the excess is increasing daily, forming two disadvantages that harm each other. Various provinces and cities should uphold the spirit of mutual assistance and regulate rice to supplement the insufficient with the surplus, in order to achieve self-sufficiency. (A) The provinces that produce rice should adopt the following policies. The main purpose is to select one or two commercial ports with convenient transportation within the province (such as Wuhu in Anhui, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, Changsha in Hunan, Hankou in Hubei, Wuxi in Jiangsu, and Shanghai) to concentrate rice for transportation and sales to other ports. Son, accumulation methods: (1) Various provinces and cities should follow the old Changpingcang system, raise public funds, and establish provincial and municipal warehouses to stabilize market prices. (2) Promote cooperatives to carry out purchasing, transportation, storage, and mortgage businesses. (3) Promote the banking and financial industries to attach new-style warehouse and grain businesses, and businesses to set up new-style warehouses to facilitate the storage of rice. Warehouses can issue warehouse receipts, and all receipts can be used to borrow from financial institutions. (4) Farmers' banks in various provinces should handle this business, and other banks and money houses should add agricultural product mortgages to provide funds for circulation. (5) Grain businesses, warehouse businesses, and stack businesses should jointly establish new-style rice mills to facilitate sales. (6) All grain businesses should establish close contact with the producing areas (referring to the nearby inland counties) to attract rice to the port for storage. Ugly, transportation methods: (1) Establish close cooperation with the transportation authorities in the selling area (referring to the coastal ports), and negotiate joint transportation and price reduction methods. (2) Establish close contact with the boatmen and shipping merchants in the producing area (referring to the nearby inland rice-producing counties), and negotiate contract transportation and unloading methods. (3) Various banks and money houses should add remittance mortgages to facilitate circulation. Yin, sales methods: The types, packaging, and weights of rice should be improved according to the wishes of the grain businesses in the selling area. (2) Grain businesses should establish close contact with grain businesses in the selling area and exchange market prices. Each grain business should send staff to reside in the selling area to attract customers to transport rice. (4) Encourage grain merchants in the selling area to open grain businesses here or send temporary brokers to handle rice. (5) Contact various military supply offices at any time to contract military food. (B) The provinces lacking rice should adopt the following policies. The main purpose is to purchase and transport rice from various domestic producing areas in succession according to the amount of rice lacking to meet the needs of the people. To the extent possible, the purpose is to persuade merchants not to purchase foreign rice. If it is unavoidable, the provincial and municipal governments must approve it if merchants want to purchase foreign rice before issuing a permit to show the restriction. (1) Estimate the types and quantities of rice lacking throughout the year and each month. (2) Investigate the harvests and storage amounts in various producing areas. (3) Tentatively purchase the types and quantities of rice from various producing areas. (4) Guide grain merchants to establish grain businesses or send brokers in the main domestic rice-producing areas to facilitate purchasing. (3) Establish close contact with grain businesses in various producing areas and report market prices to each other. The above are storage, transportation, and sales methods. The central government system is closely connected with the local area. Especially, internal and external cooperation should be carried out to achieve the greatest benefit of promotion. (1) Participate in the central control mechanism. The National Economic Commission has already decided to establish a grain control committee. It is proposed to add one member from each province and city to all the committee positions to participate and communicate opinions. (2) Raise funds for provincial and municipal warehouses. The current US cotton and wheat loans have been designated for the construction of the vehicle industry. It seems that a part of the loans should be designated specifically for provincial and municipal warehouse funds, to build warehouses and purchase surplus grain for regulating grain.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Restore All Levels of Granaries <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Outline of the measures for restoring granaries: (A) System: (1) Central reserve granary, (2) Provincial reserve granary, (3) County granary, (4) Township granary, (B) Establishment: (1) The central reserve granary is established by the central government, and the provincial reserve granary is established by each province, both for storage and regulating grain prices. It is recommended that the central government and the provinces be instructed to plan and handle the granaries below the province. Township granaries must be established universally. County granaries should also be established separately according to local conditions. District granaries are inconvenient to set up at the same time due to local financial relations. Before township granaries can be established universally, it is proposed to postpone them temporarily. (City granaries are the same as county granaries, and town granaries are the same as township granaries) (2) The original old-system grain warehouses in various places should be restored immediately, and reorganized into county or township granaries according to the situation. (3) County or township granaries should combine the old Yishe granary system. County granaries should add reserve grain, and if there is still capacity, they can also manage agricultural granary businesses. (C) Organization: (1) The county granary organizes the County Granary Management Committee to manage all the county granary's activities. The managers are nominated by local professional groups, charitable groups, financial committees, and those who donate more than 100 yuan. The county magistrate is in a supervisory position and can investigate and audit at any time. (2) The reserve quantity of the county granary should be at least 2,000 shi of brown rice or 5,000 shi of grain, for fair price relief or loaning to township granaries. (3) The township granary organizes the Township Granary Management Committee, which is composed of several directors elected by the township who are wealthy and have a good reputation, and are jointly responsible for supervision. One director is rotated to be the director of the year, who is responsible for safekeeping. (4) The grain stored in the township granary must be at least 500 shi, for lending to poor farmers and fair price distribution. (D) Funding: In addition to the two methods of collection and donation prescribed by the ministry, it is proposed to collect the funding for county and township granaries by the following methods: (1) Old granary assets, (2) Public country deposits, (3) Accumulated local expenses that are not urgent, (4) County administrative fines, (5) Public property double price, (6) Incense association shrine public collection of funds, (7) Cooperative public funds, (8) Public funding, (9) Various subsidies. In addition to the above opinions, each province should refer to the Ministry of Interior's local granary management regulations and implement them conscientiously.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang gave the closing speech, saying, "This food conference, inviting everyone to come here for a meeting, can be said to be the first major meeting related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The food issue has never been studied in this way, especially the food issues related to several provinces, and there has not been a practical solution. That's why we invited the provinces to send you here to discuss a specific method of handling food. China is a country established by agriculture, and the country is filled with foreign goods, especially foreign rice. Food occupies an important position in the clothing, food, housing, and transportation mentioned by the Prime Minister. If the food issue is not resolved, all other issues cannot be resolved. The importance of the food issue is now being studied and paid attention to by countries around the world. The current world economy cannot be adjusted and merged. The second world war will soon be triggered. This is all because the food issue has not been resolved. China's food is oppressed by foreign food dumping. More than 10 years ago, it exceeded 440 million. The Prime Minister has made it clear in the Three Principles of the People and Nationalism. As for the next 10 years, it is especially unimaginable. It is becoming more and more critical. If we do not seek a solution urgently, I am afraid China will perish immediately. Since the September 18th Incident, the dangerous situation has become even more obvious. If this issue is not resolved one day, the national economy and the people's livelihood will lose their center of gravity one day, and all political and economic matters will not be able to be implemented. You are not only knowledgeable, but also familiar with the local conditions of the provinces and have rich experience. Before the Central Food Conference is convened, this conference is like a preparatory meeting, and the results of the conference will be contributed to the central government in the future, so that there will be a prototype first, and it can be seen in the management. Because I am inspecting the front, I just came back today and did not have time to participate in the meeting. I am very sorry, but I know the results of the meeting very well. Although the resolutions are simple, they are very practical. After the meeting today, we can follow the guidelines and take each case to solve the big problems of the national economy and the people's livelihood. But the meeting has been decided, and you always have to make an effect and a result, and really follow the decided guidelines to achieve the goal. We must work hard to manage ourselves, so that we will not fail this meeting and not fail your long journey. But Chinese people have always had a bad habit, which I would like to ask you to pay attention to, that is, many meetings often become empty words after the meeting, without any results, which is equivalent to not having a meeting, and only wasting money. But this food conference is not like other conferences. Food is a matter of life and death for the national economy and the people's livelihood. No problem is more important than the national economy and the people's livelihood. Don't say that food is only a part of the people's livelihood, and has nothing to do with the national economy. You must know that all national defense and self-defense national designs must be based on the food issue. For example, if we go to war with a foreign country, even if there is no military conflict, if the foreign country imposes an economic blockade on us and the country cannot be self-sufficient in food, everyone will have nothing to eat, wouldn't we starve to death, how can we talk about resistance and self-defense? Because it is so important, we called you here for the meeting. After the meeting, we will implement them one by one. Implementation is not easy, nor is it difficult, but in the effort of implementation, if everyone can understand that the food issue is related to the country, the people, and the survival of our own lives, then of course we will work hard to implement it. Everyone should be a model, and everything can be solved. What I am afraid of is sitting and talking but not taking action, then China can only be oppressed by foreign countries forever and cannot become strong. You must understand this point of reason. After you go back, you must tell your comrades the relationship between the national economy, the people's livelihood, and your own life, and implement it according to the resolution. What has been solved at today's meeting is not the word food, but the big issue of saving the country and the people. If the food issue cannot be resolved, then the work of saving the country and the people that we usually talk about is all fake. If we don't solve the food issue, we can't talk about other issues. May everyone have a share of strength and take a share of responsibility. These words are what I sincerely contribute to everyone, and I hope that everyone will work hard to complete and realize them." (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Jiangsu Provincial Government's Rural Relief Plan | Organizing Rural Financial Relief Committee | <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The rural situation in Jiangsu Province has been extremely weak in recent years. Regarding the rural relief plan, the provincial government plans to organize a Financial Relief Committee, invite talents from all walks of life to design together, and specifically put forward the proposal passed at yesterday's meeting. It is reported that the important work of the committee is to first establish agricultural warehouses to regulate rural finance, or the provincial government purchases food, or the bank handles food storage and mortgage, and then stipulates the method according to the different situations of each county. The provincial government vigorously plans the warehouse buildings and local security conditions in each county to ensure safety. At a time when grain prices are extremely low and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the warehouse issue is the most important plan. However, the autumn harvest is about to begin, and warehouses cannot be delayed, so it is planned to establish the committee as soon as possible in order to proceed in the shortest possible time.

<p>National trunk roads are being built in order according to the resolutions of the Seven-Province Highway Conference. (1) Beijing-Shaanxi Trunk Line: Enters the province from Jiangpu, Jiangsu, passes through Wujiang, He County, Hanshan, Chaoxian, Dianbu, Hefei, Liu'an, and Yejiaji to reach the border of Henan, with a length of 306 kilometers. The Wujiang-He, He-Chao, Chao-He, and He-Liu sections have been completed one after another to facilitate bridge-soil road traffic, and formal bridges and culverts are designed and reconstructed in stages. The roadbed of the 56-kilometer Liuye section has been completed, and bridges are being built. (2) Beijing-Sichuan Trunk Line: The same route as the Beijing-Shaanxi Line to Hefei, passing through Shucheng, Tongcheng, Gaohebu, Qianshan, Taihu, and Susong to reach the border of Hubei, with a length of 294 kilometers. The He-Gao and Gao-Tai sections have been opened to traffic long ago. The formal bridges and culverts rebuilt on the He-Gao section have been largely completed and will soon be fully completed. The construction of stone pavement on a sectional basis has been recruited by merchants. Formal bridges and culverts on the Gao-Tai section are also being designed. The remaining 54-kilometer Tai-Su section has been surveyed and prepared for construction. (3) Gui-Qi Trunk Line: Enters from Shangqiu, Henan, passes through Boxian, Taihe, Fuyang, Zhengyangguan, Liu'an, Shucheng, Tongcheng, Gaohebu, Anqing, Dongliu, and Zhizhi (formerly known as Qiupu) to reach Qimen, with a length of 562 kilometers. Except that the Shu-Gao section is the same route as the Beijing-Sichuan Trunk Line, the Bao-Zheng and Zheng-Liu sections have been completed and opened to traffic. Formal bridges are being built. The An-Gao section has been open to traffic for many years, and its bridges and crushed stone pavement have been completed long ago. The Construction Department has instructed the counties to build the Liu-Shu section, and the Liu-Huo and Shu-Huo branch lines can be used to open to traffic. The 180-kilometer section from Anqing to Qimen will be postponed due to limited funding. (4) Beijing-Guizhou Trunk Line: Enters from Jiangning, Jiangsu, passes through Dangtu, Wuhu, Xuancheng, Sunjiabu, Ningguo, Jixi, Shexian, Tunxi, Xiuning, and Qimen to reach the border of Jiangxi, with a length of 414 kilometers. The Jing-Wu section was opened to traffic a few months ago, and formal bridges, culverts, and stone pavement have been completed. The Wu-Xuan section, because the original road was the old base of the Ning-Xiang Railway, has been taken back by the Ministry of Railways and handed over to the Jiangnan Railway Company to rebuild the Wu-Zha Railway. Staff have been sent to survey the new line, and a team will be organized to set off to prepare for construction soon. The She-Tun and Tun-Xiu sections have been opened to traffic long ago and will be improved according to the Seven-Province Highway Engineering Standards. However, the Xuan-She section has been under construction for many years due to overlapping mountains, and it will be completed by the end of this year. The remaining section from Qimen to the border of Jiangxi has also been surveyed by the Construction Department together with the Jiangxi Committee.</p>

<p>In the bankruptcy case of Songjiang Bank, creditors Wu Boyang and others stated that after the bank's bankruptcy, the total amount of public and private deposits owed reached more than 600,000 yuan. After the creditors filed a lawsuit, the county court selected Xi Yushu and Xia Sunhuan to establish a liquidation office in early May of last year to begin liquidation. In July, a meeting of creditors was convened to report on the liquidation situation, including items described as secured loans without security documents and mortgaged loans without collateral, totaling more than 280,000 yuan. The office has successively filed lawsuits regarding the easily litigable portions and has already issued payments twice. All deposits above 200 yuan have been recovered by half. However, the creditors hope that the office can conclude within the statutory liquidation period and return the deposits, as they are accumulated from their hard-earned money. They have sent a letter to the office requesting a second report on the progress of the case, asking whether the 280,000 yuan without supporting documents is still under investigation.</p>

<p>Recently, the silk market has reached a state of extreme panic. Silk cocoon merchants in our county are all uneasy. Another six or seven silk factories have suspended operations. Recently, Xi Huian, the owner of Huisheng Factory, disappeared due to debt. Yesterday, Wang Xuchu, the owner of Hongren Silk Cocoon Company, also suddenly disappeared. Wang started as a silk broker, was skilled in maneuvering, and was accustomed to conducting speculative business. Every spring and autumn cocoon season, Wang would set up shops in the countryside to collect cocoons, often without cash, issuing cocoon tickets indiscriminately. As a result, the villagers suffered, while Wang became a wealthy man. In recent years, due to the severe drop in silk prices, he suffered considerable losses. This autumn cocoon season was particularly disastrous, leading to debts of more than 10,000 yuan. Feeling unable to cope, he also chose to run away. The creditors are now searching everywhere, hoping that Wang will return to Wuxi to settle the matter.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhicheng, a native of Quzhou, Zhejiang, was formerly a partner in Zhang Rongchang Fruit Shop in this county. His wife, Du Guihua, was recently seduced and disappeared by Chen Zhaorong, a company commander of the Security Department stationed in Jiangyin. Unable to find her, Zhang went to Cheng to search but could not find her. He then untied his belt and hanged himself in a pine tomb in Feng Jing of the county's Hucheng District. He was rescued by villagers and sent to the Security Corps headquarters, where the deputy commander Zhao Zhongwen gave him travel expenses and contacted the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company to buy a half-price ticket for him to return to Xicheng and work in the shop. Unexpectedly, after Zhang came to Xicheng, he did not go to the shop but wandered around for several days. Having no money again, he re-enacted his suicide scene in a pine tomb in the low-lying fields near 319 Village in Hua Da Fang Zhuang of the 13th District. He was rescued by villager Yuan Peiliang, and Yuan Futang and others gave him ten silver dollars, advising him to return home. The incident was discovered by Wang Xuehan, a patrol officer of the First Substation of the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Suspecting his motives, he interrogated Zhang, who was evasive. It was clear that he was pretending to commit suicide to gain sympathy and defraud money. He ordered the police to guard him and transferred him to the Eighth Branch. Yesterday (the 25th), he was transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

He suffered from mental illness and had a strange personality. In his youth, he had vowed not to marry unless he found a stunningly beautiful woman. So, at the age of sixty, he finally married Xiu Zhen, a daughter of an old man surnamed Huang from the South Gate. Xiu Zhen was twenty-nine years old. The following year, she gave birth to a son. Just as he was feeling fortunate, his beloved wife and son suddenly died one after another. Qin Liangzu's final years were tragic, leading him to develop a world-weary thought. One theory is that he accidentally fell into the river.</p>

<h3 id="e125">This Port's Exports to the United States Increased Sharply in Nine Months; Almost Doubled Compared to the Same Period Last Year <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Shanghai's exports to the United States in the first nine months of this year, according to statistics from the US Consulate General, almost doubled compared to the same period last year. Although this statistic only includes goods that require a price list to be filled out and reported, and does not include some goods subject to ad valorem tax in the United States, it can still provide a glimpse into the general state of exports to the United States. However, in the three months of July, August, and September, Shanghai's exports to the Philippines decreased significantly compared to the same period last year, while exports to Honolulu were roughly the same. Shanghai's exports to the United States in the first nine months of this year totaled US$7,317,341, while in the same period last year, they were only US$4,691,479. Shanghai's exports to the Philippines in the last three months totaled US$878,852, while in the same period last year, they totaled US$1,114,529. Shanghai's exports to Honolulu in the last three months totaled US$40,215, while in the same period last year, they totaled US$40,540. As for the prosperity of various goods exported to the United States, the situation often differs greatly from last year. For example, sesame seeds were only 43,860 pounds in the first nine months of last year, but reached 14,743,772 pounds this year. Tung oil was only 18,298 pounds last year, but reached 220,161 pounds this year. Tea leaves also increased from 2,207,395 pounds last year to 4,217,930 pounds this year. The total value of jade increased from 14,498 yuan to 286,410 yuan.</p>

<p>The National Goods Movement Committee of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation will continue its work of inspecting Japanese goods. The original inspection committee members of the federation will depart immediately to inspect the areas of Zhejiang Road, Jiujiang Road, Shandong Road, Haining Road, Broadway Road, North Suzhou Road, Shanxi Road, Jiangxi Road, and so on, in order. The original letter from the various sub-associations requesting the federation to handle this matter is recorded below: Respectfully, Japan's invasion of China has led to the loss of the four northeastern provinces. All Chinese people should endure hardship, strive to avenge their shame, and do their utmost to resist Japanese goods and promote domestic goods. As Japanese imports increase daily and large quantities of Japanese rice are imported, draining our money and bankrupting our countryside, we cannot stand idly by in the face of Japan's heinous policy of aggression. In accordance with the resolutions of the National Goods Movement Representative Conference of the federation, we should implement the inspection of Japanese goods and continue to work hard to implement our demands without delay.

<h3 id="e127">Fujian Gang Refuses to Load China Merchants Bureau Ships; To Transport Domestic Goods to Fujian for Cheap Sale; Believes it Impedes Their Business <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Introduction Office transports goods to Fujian for cheap sale, which Fujian merchants believe hinders their business, causing great opposition from the Fujian Gang, involving the shipping company. The Fuzhou Gang refuses to load ships of the China Merchants Bureau because they transport goods from the National Goods Introduction Office to Fujian. The bureau collects freight from the Fujian Gang, which they also refuse to pay, drawing swords and bows, each going to extremes. The details are explored below:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Origin of Domestic Goods Entering Fujian <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>This year is the year of domestic goods. Leaders of various industries in Shanghai specially organized a National Goods Introduction Office to promote sales throughout the country at low prices. Fuzhou is also one of its distribution ports. Unexpectedly, the cheap sale of goods introduced by the National Goods Introduction Office to Fujian was welcomed by the people, but the commercial industry in Fujian suffered a major blow. If they lowered prices to compete, they would lose money. If they sold at the same price, no one would patronize them. All kinds of business were taken away by the National Goods Introduction Office. Therefore, the Fujian Gang strongly opposed the office. The Shanghai Sanshan Guild Hall is a gathering place for various commercial gangs in Fujian. For the sake of maintaining the business of each gang in the province, they negotiated to refuse the entry of goods from the National Goods Introduction Office into Fujian. Their method of obstruction was to negotiate with various commercial shipping companies to agree not to transport goods from the office. If they continue to load the goods, the Fujian Gang will stop loading goods with the shipping company.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Contacting Various Shipping Companies <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there are four shipping lines operating on the Shanghai-Fujian route: Changan, Sanbei, Yihe, and China Merchants. The most frequent transport of goods from the Fuzhou Gang is handled by the customs declaration firms and passenger gangs affiliated with the Sanshan Guild Hall. Therefore, the Sanshan Guild Hall's cargo transport business is the largest. Since the incident of the National Goods Introduction Office, the Fujian Gang entrusted Wang of the Sanshan Guild Hall to contact various shipping companies, requesting them to consider Fujian's commercial industry and persuade the shipping lines not to transport goods from the office. If they continue to load the goods, the Fujian Gang will stop loading goods with that shipping company. As a result of the negotiations, Sanbei, Changan, and Yihe expressed their sympathy, and the Fujian Gang's struggle against the trend of domestic goods seemed to have come to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e130">China Merchants Loading Dispute <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the shipping companies believed that the National Goods Introduction Office was only a temporary business, while the Sanshan Guild Hall was a fundamental transport business. Therefore, Changan first agreed, Yihe also agreed not to load, and Sanbei even held a banquet with the Fujian Gang in the guild hall. China Merchants Bureau initially permitted it, but recently the National Goods Introduction Office had several hundred pieces of textiles, etc., which were pledged to the bank, and loaded them onto China Merchants ships to enter Fuzhou. The Fujian Gang believed that China Merchants had violated its position and was still transporting domestic goods. Therefore, the Fuzhou Passenger Gang decided together to unanimously refuse to load China Merchants Bureau ships, refusing to load any import or export cargo from Shanghai and Fujian. The dispute arose from this.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Negotiations Between the Two Parties <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau believes that the transport of textiles to Fujian was arranged by the pledging bank, and the cargo owner had informed Wang of the Sanshan Guild Hall of the details in advance, fearing that it would cause a dispute. Moreover, the Bureau, with its state-run position, could not welcome this refusal in fact. After this refusal to load occurred, the China Merchants Bureau entrusted the Municipal Shipping Association to mediate. However, it was reported that the Fujian Gang must have a formal representation from the Bureau to prove that they would no longer transport their goods in the future before a settlement could be reached. This matter is feared to be difficult to accomplish, resulting in many Fujian gangs temporarily stopping the loading of cargo that had already been reported. The Bureau is now requiring the customs declaration firms to pay the freight for the goods that have already been recorded, but the Fujian Gang firmly refuses to pay. The two parties are insisting, and it is not known how to resolve it.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Taisun Sails to Fujian as Usual <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Merchant Steam Navigation Bureau's Taisun, scheduled to sail to Fuzhou today, has suffered significant impact on its export cargo since the freight refusal incident. Many Hakka passengers temporarily stopped boarding. However, the Bureau has ordered the Taisun to proceed to Fujian on schedule, even if it sails empty, to maintain the route. Before the issue is resolved, freight between Shanghai and Fujian is mostly being transported by ships from Sanbei Yihong and other companies under the management of the Fuzhou Association. It is said that the Shanghai Merchant Steam Navigation Bureau is actively seeking methods for resolution.</p>

Coal, miscellaneous goods, soybeans, and raw salt were the next largest items, totaling 1,295,510 yuan, accounting for slightly less than one-eighth of the total. The remaining twenty items, such as lumber and fertilizer, accounted for less than one-fifteenth of the total, with a value of 600,256 yuan. Goods exported from New Yiju Port totaled 6,921,979 yuan, with the main items including miscellaneous goods, timber, and cotton fabrics, totaling 5,130,089 yuan. The next largest items were Japanese socks, rubber boots, cotton yarn, cement, small mail packages, and fish, totaling 1,447,864 yuan. Finally, woolen fabrics and rice totaled 344,026 yuan.

<p>The Ministry of Industry, recognizing that all alcohol used domestically relies on imports, has learned from customs investigations that alcohol imports in the Republic of China's 20th year (1931) totaled around five million gallons annually. Furthermore, there are smuggled and tax-evading products. The Ministry of Industry is establishing a state-run alcohol factory in partnership with overseas merchant Huang Jiangquan to recover lost rights. The capital is set at one million yuan, and a joint venture agreement has been signed. The factory will be located in Shanghai, and progress is being made. A New News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources that after the Russian and French merchants in Shanghai learned of this news, they immediately took it seriously. Anticipating that the Ministry of Industry's state-run alcohol factory will take time to materialize, they actively prepared to jointly establish an alcohol factory in Shanghai to gain an advantage. The capital is provisionally set at 600,000 yuan, with each country's merchants contributing half. It is said that most of the joint venture procedures have been agreed upon and that the factory is scheduled to be established in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Supplementary Measures After Ferry Service Inauguration: Drafted by Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Beining Railways <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since the inauguration of the capital railway ferry, the results have been quite good. The Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Beining Railways have now specially stipulated the following supplementary measures for the inauguration of the capital railway ferry: (1) The Shanghai-Beiping through train is designed for the convenience of through-transport passengers.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Seats on the Train <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Should be allocated to through-transport passengers first. Any remaining seats may be allocated to passengers on the route as appropriate. The first- and second-class sleeping cars should primarily sell sleeper tickets. However, as the second-class cars are all sleeping cars, second-class passengers must purchase berth tickets. If berths are available, berth tickets may be waived, but only for through-transport and local passengers on the 301 down train and local passengers on the 302 up train. All second-class through-transport passengers on the up train must purchase berth tickets. (2) Shanghai-Beiping through train second-class berth tickets are priced at 2.50 yuan per night for the upper berth and 3 yuan for the lower berth. (3) Dining car seats may not be sold as passenger tickets. (4) Shanghai-Beiping through train tickets must be sold based on the number of sleeping berths and seats available in each class of car and must not be exceeded. (A detailed table of the number of sleeping berths and seats available on the Shanghai-Beiping through train and the schedule of rotations has been separately circulated to all relevant stations for notification and should be given special attention.) All relevant stations should coordinate the sale of sleeping berth and passenger tickets to avoid exceeding the number of berths and seats. For example, after the 302 train departs, if there are any remaining first- or second-class</p>
<h3 id="e137">Remaining Sleeping Berths <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>or seats, or third-class seats, the Shanghai North Station should telegraph the Suzhou Station. After the train departs from the Suzhou Station, if there are still remaining berths or seats, the Suzhou Station should telegraph the Wuxi Station. The remaining stops should follow this procedure accordingly. As for the 301 through train, when departing from the Nanjing Station, if there are any remaining first- or second-class sleeping berths or seats, or third-class seats, the Nanjing Station should telegraph the Zhenjiang Station. The remaining stops should follow this procedure accordingly. (5) Stations wishing to reserve first- or second-class sleeping berths on the 302 train should telegraph the Shanghai North Station information desk. Those wishing to reserve second-class sleeping berths on the 301 train should telegraph the Nanjing Station. (6) The freight charges for luggage and parcels transported on the Shanghai-Beiping through train should be calculated according to the through-transport mileage listed in the Shanghai-Beiping through train fare schedule. (This fare schedule is currently being compiled by the Through Transport Department of the Ministry of Railways and will be distributed to all relevant stations for application upon issuance. The original 50 kilometers between the Beijing and Pukou sections in the schedule have been removed.) The river crossing fee stipulates that luggage will be charged 5 cents per 20 kilograms. Less than 20 kilograms will also be calculated as 20 kilograms, with a minimum charge of 10 cents. Parcels will be charged 3 li per kilogram for the river crossing fee, with a minimum charge of 10 cents. (6) Above</p>
<h3 id="e138">Luggage and Parcels <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>River crossing fees and passenger fares have been stipulated, no other donations or fees may be added, nor may they be reduced due to various discount tickets. All those not crossing the river by ferry will continue to be handled in accordance with current procedures. (7) Shanghai-Beiping through train tickets and all tickets supplemented on the Shanghai-Beiping through train will be printed with the four red characters "Shanghai-Beiping Through Train" for clarity, and a red horizontal line will be added above the "Shanghai-Beiping Through Train" characters to indicate that it includes the extra fast train surcharge. (8) The procedures for supplementing tickets on the Shanghai-Beiping through train should be simplified. If tickets are supplemented en route, all road and ferry fares (ferry fares: first class 6 jiao, second class 4 jiao, third class 2 jiao) and fees should be collected at once to avoid the need for each road to supplement fees on its own and to save procedures. (9) The ticket inspectors on the Shanghai-Beiping through train should follow Article 17 of the Shanghai-Beiping Through Train Operating Rules for supplementing tickets. (10) The capital railway ferry tickets were previously ordered by the Traffic Department on October 12, P.B. No. 200, and the associated joint transport stations directly received them from the accounting office. Now, because the Shanghai-Beiping through train fare schedule</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Listed Fares <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Already include the ferry fee, these ferry tickets are no longer used. (11) The 301 and 302 Shanghai-Beiping through trains do not stop at the Sangyuan and Lianzhen stations on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. These two stations do not sell tickets for the Shanghai-Beiping through train. However, for the convenience of passengers holding tickets from other joint transport stations to these two stations, they may be allowed to purchase joint tickets. When the ticket holder arrives at the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the ticket inspector on the route should telegraph the Sangyuan or Lianzhen stations in advance. When the train arrives at the station, it will temporarily stop to allow passengers to disembark; otherwise, the train will proceed as usual without stopping.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Measures for Charging for Storage of Mutually Transported Materials Between Railways: Railway Ministry Instructs Railway Bureaus to Comply <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the measures for charging for the storage of mutually transported materials between railways at stations, the Ministry of Railways yesterday specifically instructed the railway bureaus, saying that according to Article 32 of the General Rules for Freight Transport (If goods are stored at a station or railway freight yard, the railway may charge storage fees in accordance with the provisions and prices set by the railway.), this railway charges ordinary merchants storing goods at stations according to the grade of the goods. The railway charges storage fees for goods that the railway is responsible for, calculated at 3 jiao 5 fen per ton for first-class goods per 24 hours or less than 24 hours, 3 fen per 50 kilograms, 3 jiao per ton for second-class goods, 2 fen 5 li per 50 kilograms, 2 jiao 5 fen per ton for third-class goods, 2 fen per 50 kilograms, 2 jiao per ton for fourth-class goods, 1 fen 5 li per 50 kilograms, 1 jiao 5 fen per ton for fifth-class goods, 1 fen per 50 kilograms, and 1 jiao per ton for sixth-class goods, 5 li per 50 kilograms. If the goods are the responsibility of the owner, the storage fee is reduced by half according to the above price rates. If the goods are stored at this railway's material factory, regardless of grade, the charge is 4 jiao 5 fen per ton per month. However, the freight charges for mutually transported materials between railways are not graded. When materials from other railways are stored at this railway's stations, the charge is 4 jiao 5 fen per ton per month. When materials are stored at this railway's stations, should the storage fee be charged according to the grade of the materials, as with ordinary goods, or should a separate price rate for the storage of materials from other railways be set? Please review and instruct. After investigation, materials mutually transported between railways are generally escorted by this railway. The station storage fee should be reduced by half as for goods the owner is responsible for, to show mutual benefit. In addition to instructing and separately instructing, you are hereby ordered to comply. The bureau has forwarded this order to the traffic department for compliance.</p>

<p>Liu Yicheng, representative of Commander Zhang Yuting of the Northeast Volunteer Army General Commander Wang Delin's troops, came to Shanghai yesterday under orders from the Jilin front. He reported on the recent tyrannical and brutal behavior of the Japanese army in various parts of the Northeast, including the slaughter of the people. The facts are hereby announced to the people of the country and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Arson, Destruction of Houses, Rape, and Murder <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>On September 22, Zhang Yuting, the Director of Military Operations of the Volunteer Army, departed from Dongning Nanquanzigou and led his troops to attack the Japanese army. On September 23, they arrived at Yantongyazi. Zhang's headquarters was located in the Xu family compound. Xu Jiashan, the steward of the compound, was the head of a hundred households in the area. Mr. Xu was humble, righteous, and particularly enthusiastic about saving the country. When Zhang's troops entered the area, Mr. Xu spared no effort to run around and raise supplies. The local people were also happy to help, bringing food and drinks to support the national salvation army. Later, on September 24, the Volunteer Army advanced to Twenty-Eight Daohazi and engaged in repeated fierce battles with the Japanese army, but retreated due to insufficient ammunition. After the retreat, the Japanese army first set fire to the civilian houses in Yantongyazi, then found the Xu family compound, accused Xu Jiashan of collaborating with the enemy, and bound him and hanged him. He was beaten with iron bars, leaving his body covered in injuries. He cried out and died. Many young women in the neighboring houses to the left and right of the compound were first violated and then stabbed to death. One child who cursed the Japanese for their barbarity was impaled with bayonets and used as a plaything, screaming in agony until death.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Arbitrary Arrests, Hand Chopping, and Foot Mutilation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, a dozen civilian houses in Twenty-Eight Daohazi were also destroyed and burned. People were captured everywhere and interrogated about whether they had any connection with the Volunteer Army. Those who did not confess were subjected to horrific torture. Some had their hands chopped off, others had their feet mutilated, and still others had only their ears and noses cut off or the tips of their tongues cut off, left neither alive nor dead, rolling on the ground screaming in agony. The sight of blood and flesh was everywhere, and anyone with a conscience could not help but grieve.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Airplanes Drop Bombs, Flesh and Blood Flying <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Also, at the beginning of last month, when the Volunteer Army led by Wu Yicheng, Zhang Yuting, and Liu Shunqing attacked Dongning, the Japanese and puppet troops in the city were weak and about to collapse. Therefore, several aircraft were dispatched to bomb the city extensively. In addition to some casualties among our Volunteer Army, the residents inside and outside the city were also affected. The most tragic case was that of an old farmer's family. The family of four, including the husband, wife, and children, made a living by raising livestock and pulling carts. As the old farmer was feeding the livestock, an airplane flew over and dropped a heavy bomb, instantly killing the entire family, including the livestock. Flesh and blood flew everywhere, a sight too gruesome to bear. Commander Zhang, deeply saddened by the repeated and unwarranted injuries inflicted upon the people by the violent Japanese, has reportedly asked General Commanders Wang Delin and Kong Xianrong for instructions to provide compensation and aid the injured and comfort the people.</p>

Furthermore, each country, with its vast air force, will fully exert its power in this war. The extent of the destruction and the cruelty of the consequences are beyond our imagination. The China Arts and Crafts Society on Love Road and the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge are holding aviation exhibitions to raise public awareness of air defense. The Aviation Association has agreed to assist in the design and provide materials and will hold them successively next month.</p>

<p>Fuxing Society reported that Jin Shuishan, a student at the Central Artillery School, requested leave to return to his hometown (Guangdong) during the summer vacation. He transferred to Shanghai from Beijing and took the Yisun steamer south. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Consulate General identified him as a Korean revolutionary and, together with the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, arrested Jin when the Yisun weighed anchor, detaining him at the team and transferring him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Because Jin claimed to be from Guangdong, the Municipal Public Security Bureau refused extradition and sent Jin to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The Japanese Consulate General then requested extradition from the headquarters, but it was ultimately refused because Jin's nationality was unclear. It has been almost three months to this day. A Korean expatriate told the Fuxing Society reporter yesterday that after the Songhu Garrison Headquarters took Jin into custody, it sent letters to the Central Artillery School and the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau to inquire about Jin's nationality. The Central Artillery School replied that Jin's registration form listed his籍貫 as Guangdong. The Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau also replied that the Jin surname and the names of his parents were recorded in the Guangzhou household register, proving that Jin was undoubtedly a Chinese citizen.</p>

The initiators have further decided that the cause of saving the country should not be selfish and have decided to issue a public notice to solicit automatic participation from all sectors. Since the announcement was issued, hundreds of letters requesting plans and articles of association have been received daily. Zhang Qiyun, Liu Ranji, Li Zuheng, Wang Bingkui, Lu Wenhuan, and other gentlemen have rushed to submit share funds to the various collecting banks. This shows the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for paying attention to the production and sales business. The company has replied to all those who have automatically paid shares to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Large-Scale Domestic Cotton Fabric Market to Open: A Domestic Fabric Barrier Rising After the Iron Industry Barrier <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Since the armistice in North China, the other side has shifted its military aggression strategy and devoted itself to economic aggression. The import of goods of hate has increased daily. People with knowledge are worried about it. Therefore, Hu Juewen, Zhang Zilian, Ren Jinping, and other gentlemen, who have always been committed to promoting national goods, have joined forces with a few like-minded comrades to plan organized resistance to the best of their ability. For two months, they have been assisting the Shanghai Copper, Iron, and Machinery Association in planning the construction of an iron industry barrier. On the one hand, they are doing their best to resist the promotion of hate goods, and on the other hand, they are assisting the Liuhegou Iron Mine Company in seeking the development of the national iron industry. Now that the association's enthusiastic colleagues have unanimously implemented the construction work, it has been completed. In addition, Mr. Hu and others have also engaged in the second plan of building a domestic fabric barrier. The implementation of this plan will be sufficient to resist 6,000 pieces of hate yarn per month and stabilize the lives of 20,000 handicraft workers. Everyone who heard the news was happy to support it. Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China has also promised to allocate 100,000 yuan as support, and Rong Zongjing of the Shenxin Spinning Mill is also willing to reduce yarn prices to help it succeed. Therefore, the plan is progressing rapidly. Recently, because Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Li Zushen, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Huang Yanfang, Du Chongyuan, Wang Zhenfang, Xu Caicheng, Qian Chengxu, Zheng Chengqing, Wang Xianqing, Dong Juesun, Li Dixian, Yao Huiquan, Zhu Shoushan, Huo Yamin, Zhang Zi'an, Yang Jiaoqi, Qin Huaixin, Shi Peilin, etc. have jointly supported the organization of the China National Cotton Fabric Market Co., Ltd. and rented numbers 25 to 29 of the new building on Guizhou Road, Nanjing Road, as a market. Preparations are now complete, and various procedures will be opened soon. The company's origins are recorded as follows, as a wake-up call in the midst of the surge in hate goods.</p>
<p>The origins of the China National Cotton Fabric Market Co., Ltd. Anyone who knows the world situation today is aware that economic panic and increased unemployment are major international problems recently. The evolution of this problem, on a small scale, is enough to affect people's livelihood and 安宁 of society, and on a large scale, it is enough to affect the politics and survival of the country. Therefore, today's world politicians who talk about governing the country are all striving to alleviate the economy and save unemployment. The catastrophe in the four northeastern provinces of Rehe, as well as the course of the World Economic Conference, make it even more believable. After the national crisis, these colleagues did not want to overestimate their abilities and followed the government's call for long-term resistance and worked hard to build the economy and save unemployment. In the former, colleagues had planned to assist the Shanghai Copper, Iron, and Utensil Industry Association in building an iron industry barrier. Now, in response to the request of 20,000 domestic cotton fabric mechanics, they are launching an organization campaign for the China National Cotton Fabric Market. The conduct of this movement, on the one hand, wants to preserve the lives of 20,000 workers in the cotton fabric industry, and on the other hand, wants to build a barrier to resist a part of Japanese yarn and fabric. In other words, it wants to increase production for the country, relieve the people's difficulties, and eliminate future hidden concerns for the local government and the工部局 that manages the concession. For this reason, chapters and rules are subdivided and sympathy is sought, and it is still hoped that enthusiastic gentlemen will help and teach them.</p>

<p>Xi Dejiong, Director of Disaster Relief of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, specially dispatched Shandong, Henan, and Hebei investigation and relief directors to go to the disaster areas to establish investigation and relief sub-offices in order to implement disaster relief. It is now known that the group has received telegrams from the directors in various places that the local investigation and relief sub-offices have been established one after another. There are five offices in Henan Province: Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Fengqiu, Huaxian, and Wenxian; seven offices in Shandong Province: Heze, Shou Zhang, Fan County, Donghe, Juye, Shan County, and Jining; and three offices in Hebei Province: Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming. The above three provinces have a total of fifteen sub-offices, each of which must manage the disaster areas of two or three nearby counties. The organization of each office is responsible by an investigation and relief committee member, under whom there are several investigation and relief personnel who are responsible for disaster relief affairs. It is also known that the ten thousand sets of cotton clothes ordered by the group's acquisition and transportation department, in addition to the first batch transported to Henan and Hebei provinces on the 17th of this month for distribution, the second batch of 20,000 sets has also been made and loaded onto a special train yesterday, attached to the Shanghai-Beiping through train, transported to Jinan for unloading, and handed over to the Shandong investigation and relief director for distribution to the disaster victims of the seven investigation and relief sub-offices under his jurisdiction, such as Heze.

<h3 id="e156">Hangzhou Municipal Government Convenes Tourist Travel Research Conference, Two Railway Bureau Directors Zheng Baozhao Attend in Hangzhou <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The passenger transportation business of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has always been comprised of about half tourists, and among the tourists, foreign visitors account for a considerable number. Although Shanghai is a major commercial port in our country, the so-called "ten-mile foreign concession" mostly features European and American characteristics, with very little of our own national scenery. Foreigners who wish to see the unique cultural scenery and architecture of our country spanning thousands of years naturally consider Nanjing and Hangzhou, the closest locations to Shanghai, as the best destinations. Therefore, the road between Shanghai and Hangzhou sees a constant stream of Chinese and foreign tourists throughout the year, especially during the pleasant spring and autumn seasons. Recently, the Hangzhou Municipal Government, recognizing this, has specifically proposed to organize a Tourist Travel Research Association and held a meeting at the Hangzhou Municipal Government on the 25th of this month. The meeting will thoroughly study all aspects related to tourist travel, including famous scenic spots and historical sites in Hangzhou, travel routes, transportation, hotels, and other related matters, in order to gather collective wisdom and plan for progress. Various measures for protection, renovation, improvement, and promotion will be implemented separately, aiming to make guests feel at home and make travel convenient for tourists. The hope is to promote our country's inherent culture and change foreigners' misconceptions. This is not only closely related to the prosperity of Hangzhou and the railway business but also greatly beneficial to promoting our country's inherent culture and enhancing our country's international standing. Zheng Baozhao, director of the traffic department of the two railways, is also a member of the research association and departed for Hangzhou yesterday morning (the 25th) to attend, it is said.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency report states that Zhu Jia-hua, Minister of Communications, in order to facilitate telegraph delivery and save expenses, has decided to merge postal and telegraph services and to construct a Beijing-Shanghai telegraph line along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway within this year. A Central News Agency reporter inquired about this matter yesterday morning with Hua Jinghan, business manager of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, who stated the following:</p>
<h3 id="e159">Postal and Telegraph Merger <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the postal and telegraph merger, the bureau has not yet received a formal order from the ministry. However, it is understood that the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate delivery and save expenses, has decided to implement this in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications specially sent Zhou Jiyao, head of the Sixth Division, to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss merger procedures with Peng Yuyi, the national line director. It is heard that the merger method has been decided, with all third and fourth class telegraph branches in various locations being merged into the local post offices. This should result in significant savings in terms of delivery and expenses. It is expected that this can be implemented by January next year.</p>

<p>Because traffic between Beijing and Shanghai is becoming increasingly dense and the existing telegraph lines are insufficient, the Ministry of Communications has decided to construct a Beijing-Shanghai telegraph line along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway in the coming days. All materials have been transported and are currently being inventoried. Construction will begin shortly on four sections: Beijing-Zhenjiang, Zhenjiang-Wuxi, Wuxi-Suzhou, and Suzhou-Shanghai. It is scheduled to be completed by early December of this year and put into operation by the end of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e161">New Machines Arriving Soon <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, recognizing that the existing telegraph machines in various bureaus are outdated and slow, has ordered more than 30 of the latest telegraph receivers and transmitters from abroad. Two machines have already arrived in Shanghai and have been installed in the Beijing and Shanghai bureaus, respectively. As a result, telegraph delivery between Beijing and Shanghai is now faster than before. Six more machines are expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. Once all the new machines have been delivered and installed, communication throughout the country can be accelerated significantly, it is said.</p>

Mayor of Beiping, Yuan Liang, was appointed as the inventory supervisor. The handover in Beiping has now been completed. However, some ancient artifacts were moved south to Shanghai for storage due to the situation in the past. Now, due to the takeover, the Beiping Municipal Government has specifically sent Xu Jiahan and the museum has sent Secretary Wu Ying to handle the matter. These personnel have been busy in recent days, jointly conducting spot checks and inventories. According to staff at the old warehouse on Tianzhutang Street, the spot checks are expected to be completed within two or three days. As for the return to Beiping, there is no definite news yet.

<h3 id="e164">Joint Statement from the Postal Workers' Unions to All Sectors Regarding the Liu-Yang Embezzlement Case <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>A joint statement from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Unions to all sectors regarding the Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping embezzlement case at the former Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau: A Public Statement to All Sectors of the Country: According to reports, the Control Yuan has impeached Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping, the former directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, for dereliction of duty, embezzlement, and illegal activities. Furthermore, the "Shen Bao" of this port published on the 16th of this month reported that Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping, the former directors of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, were impeached by the Control Yuan for dereliction of duty and embezzlement, and that the Central Public Servants Disciplinary Committee and the Shanghai District Court had successively conducted investigations according to law, finding that Liu and Yang were suspected of major embezzlement. It was also said that the most important point in this case was the discrepancy in the amount paid for the purchase of land, amounting to as much as 150,000 yuan. Since this news was disseminated, not only have our two postal workers' unions been deeply indignant, but people from all walks of life should also be shocked to hear of it. The Savings and Remittance Bureau is a savings institution for the hard-earned money of the common people, and Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping were administrative officials appointed by the government. The importance of the matter and the seriousness of the case are by no means comparable to ordinary news. There are two points that our two unions want to address: (1) The Savings and Remittance Bureau was established in 1930 by separating the savings and remittance departments from the General Post Office. The original purpose of establishing these two departments was to utilize the stable position of the postal service and its already established reputation to facilitate the public and promote thrift. In other words, the assets of the postal service and its operating surplus were used as a guarantee to promote the cause of national prosperity and benefit the people. Furthermore, the savings and remittance business was handled by postal personnel in the past. Because postal personnel had extensive experience in handling savings and remittance business and were well aware of the close relationship between savings and remittance business and the postal service, the smoothness and prudence of operations were self-evident. From this, it can be seen that there was not only no need to separate the postal savings and remittance business from the postal service itself, but there was also the fact that it could not be separated. Therefore, we cannot but regard the separation of the Savings and Remittance Bureau from the Postal Bureau as a major mistake. Furthermore, if the Savings and Remittance Bureau had not been separated in the first place, Liu and Yang's embezzlement would not have been possible. This is the first point we want to make. (2) Regarding the issue of personnel recruitment, the postal service has a very strict system for personnel recruitment. Appointments are based on principles, promotions and demotions are orderly, and the lives of current personnel are guaranteed. With these factors in place, postal service personnel are able to remain loyal to their duties and not harbor ulterior motives. However, since the establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, the bureau has completely destroyed the good personnel system that the Postal Bureau has always used. As a result, low-level staff were promoted through connections, filling every available position, while key officials came and went, with no consistency in their appointments. It is estimated that at the beginning of the bureau's establishment, no less than 20 or 30 people entered the bureau through the kinship of the bureau director. Furthermore, the director of the bureau has changed three times in a short period of time. A national economic institution has been transformed into an arena for bureaucratic politicians to compete for power. It is naturally impossible to expect the staff at all levels to devote themselves to their work. Therefore, we cannot but regard the government's appointment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau to destroy the postal service's personnel system as a miscalculation. If the advancement of savings and remittance personnel depended on genuine talent and ability, and if their positions were fully guaranteed, then the bureau's staff would be aware that safeguarding the lifeline of the bureau was more important than individual gains. Would Liu and Yang have dared to engage in embezzlement without any fear? This is the second point we want to make. Regarding the two points above, the mistake of establishing a separate Savings and Remittance Bureau and the inappropriateness of the bureau's personnel recruitment have been repeatedly and vehemently conveyed to all sectors by our two postal workers' unions. We are not surprised by the discovery of the Liu-Yang embezzlement case this time, as it was expected. However, our two postal workers' unions have also taken preventive measures, proposing a plan to consolidate the postal base and launching a large-scale campaign to eliminate hidden dangers in advance. The biggest goal of the plan to consolidate the postal base proposed by our two postal workers' unions last year was to recover the Savings and Remittance Bureau and restore the previous state of postal personnel concurrently handling savings and remittance business. The plan has already been discussed by the Postal Economic System Research Committee for more than a year and has been recommended to the National Government, requesting its adoption and implementation. Unexpectedly, our government still has some reservations and has delayed the full implementation of the plan until now. This is what we are greatly puzzled by. Now, the Liu-Yang embezzlement case has been investigated by the Shanghai District Court and evidence has been found, and the Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution. Liu and Yang will naturally be punished by law. In addition to urging the judicial authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and severely punish them to restore the hard-earned money of the common people, we are more determined to realize the plan to consolidate the postal base and deeply feel the urgent need to implement the plan and continue to strive for it. We hope that people from all walks of life will pay attention to this case and to the postal savings and remittance business, which is related to the economy of all sectors, and give us a sympathetic response. It is fortunate for the nation and fortunate for our colleagues. Jointly issued by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Association on October 25, 1933.</p>

<p>A record of the emergency relief efforts undertaken by the Joint International Famine Relief Commission: (Both Banks of the Yellow River) The commission believes that the number of flood victims is very large, and the weather is already cold, so there is an urgent need for clothing. 10,000 new cotton garments have been made and are being discussed with the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee to request free transportation. However, there is still concern that the clothing is insufficient for distribution, and it is planned to continue making 10,000 garments to make up the shortfall. (Chongming) The commission reports that the entire county has been severely affected by the disaster. More than 2,000 packages of white rice and corn, as well as 2,000 cotton garments, have been shipped successively. Special commissioners have been dispatched and are currently distributing the goods. However, there is still concern that the clothing and rice are insufficient, and it is planned to continue shipping them to avoid any feeling of being left out. (Qidong) The commission has allocated several hundred dan of rice, 2,500 garments, and 6,000 yuan in relief funds, and is currently conducting emergency relief efforts in conjunction with the Jisheng Society. (Chuansha) The commission has allocated 5,000 yuan and 1,000 cotton garments, and has also conducted emergency relief efforts in conjunction with the Jisheng Society. (Nanhui) The commission has publicly appointed Mr. Lu Bohong to carry 3,000 yuan to conduct on-site inspections and distributions. (Baoshan) The commission reports that the flood disaster in Changxing and other areas is severe, and food supplies have been cut off. It has immediately allocated several hundred dan of rice and 1,500 cotton garments and pants to Mr. Zhang Gongquan for transportation and relief. (Shaanxi) In addition to continuously transporting large quantities of relief grain and cash, purchasing seeds, and providing medicines, the commission has allocated another 40,000 yuan for post-disaster recovery to undertake the Jinghui No. 2 and No. 5 branch canal projects, and 20,000 yuan for well-digging projects. All the projects will be completed this month, it is said. (Gaoyou) During the floods of previous years, the six major breaches in the county, including the retaining wall for military grain, were repaired by the commission. Due to time and economic constraints, earthwork was used, but the cost was no less than 300,000 yuan. In order to ensure consolidation and prevent future disasters, the commission is now rebuilding the stone works and has reportedly raised tens of thousands of yuan, which will be used for construction next month, it is said. (Qingjiangpu) Located in Huai'an County, the Fu Gong Dam is dedicated to protecting the waters of Hongze, Baima, and Bao Ying, safeguarding 8,000 acres of farmland and the lives of 100,000 people. The dam collapsed during the floods of previous years, and the people were poor and unable to repair it. The commission joined forces with the Jiangsu Disaster Prevention Association to undertake the repair of the dam, which was completed long ago. The cost was reportedly nearly 30,000 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Recent News on the Mutual Aid and Cooperative Societies in the Yellow River Disaster Area; Shanghai Office of the Joint International Famine Relief Commission Decides to Establish Them <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the China Joint International Famine Relief Commission, located on the second floor of the Central Building at No. 49 Nanjing Road, reports that due to the Yellow River overflowing its banks, breaching dikes, and flooding more than fifty counties in southern Hebei, central Henan, and western Shandong, rural buildings, farming implements, and seeds have been completely destroyed. About three million disaster victims lack clothing and food and are crying out for help. Although the Beijing headquarters is actively raising relief funds and carrying out emergency relief efforts in the disaster area, the fundamental solution is to restore rural organizations in order to ensure post-disaster recovery. It has been decided to gradually establish mutual aid societies and cooperative societies in the Yellow River disaster area and to send personnel to the disaster areas most severely affected to carry out this work. Using scientific methods, the spirit of the latest mutual aid societies and cooperative societies in the East and West will be adopted, and practical measures such as loans instead of direct relief will be implemented to meet the needs of disaster-stricken farmers to restore rural organizations and finance. Currently, Mr. An Xianjin, a foreign staff member, and Mr. Shen Mingsan, a Chinese staff member, are jointly raising relief funds from Chinese and foreign philanthropists and actively carrying out the plan in order to achieve its realization in the shortest possible time. This is truly good news for the Yellow River disaster victims.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Forging Telegraphs to Damage the Reputation of Silk Firms; Xing Zhonghe Charged with Two Crimes <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The annual production of yellow and white silk in Shandong Province is quite large. Most of these merchants personally transport their goods to Shanghai and hand them over to silk firms that specialize in selling yellow and white silk for consignment sales. Some, relying solely on the usual reputation of the silk firms, directly ship their goods to the silk firms for consignment sales. Some silk firms with strong capital even send their own staff to the production areas to purchase the goods themselves. For example, Hengsheng Gong in Hengyuan Lane on Tianjin Road, Yifengchang on Jiangxi Road, and Yonghecheng at No. 529 Tianjin Road all operate in the yellow and white silk business. Competition among firms has always been fierce, and the means of competition have been getting worse and worse, becoming exceptionally base. Recently, false information has been spread through telegraphs to damage the reputation of competitors. On July 31 of this year, someone attempted to harm Hengsheng Gong and Yifengchang by falsely using the name of Wang Shuchang at No. 98 Bafang Lane in the Eight Immortals Bridge area to send a telegram to the Shandong Qingzhou Linqu Silk Industry Protection Committee, stating that Hengyi and Yifeng owe banks too much money and that it has been decided to seize their goods for compensation, or to auction them off to make up for the shortfall, and to sue them for any remaining amount. Ten such telegrams were sent at the same time. In addition to the Silk Industry Protection Committee, various merchants operating in yellow and white silk in various places, including Yongjude, Jutongxing, Hengshunxing, Fuhetai, Delong, Yuanfeng, Shenji, Fucheng, Guangzengmao, and others in Zhoucun and Zhoufang, received these telegrams and did not dare to continue entrusting the two firms with consignment sales. At this time, Yonghecheng took the opportunity to solicit business from merchants in various places. Subsequently, after the staff of Hengsheng Gong and Yifengchang stationed in Shandong inquired with the Silk Industry Protection Committee about the reason why various merchants had stopped entrusting them with the sale of goods, they were able to read the above-mentioned telegram. It was then notified to the Shanghai firms that the false telegram was actually fabricated by Xing Zhonghe (also known as Xing Zhonghe), the manager of Yonghecheng Silk Firm. Xing's action was partly to compete for business and partly to vent his anger and seek revenge. Previously, when Xing was the manager of Yuhecheng Silk Firm, Yuhecheng and several affiliated firms, including Yutaixing, Yuxingcheng, Yucheng, Yongxiecheng, Yongfukang, Wufutang, Xinji, and Yitaicheng, owed Hengsheng Gong and Yifengchang a total of more than 300,000 yuan. Cai and Zhang repeatedly urged Xing to repay the debt, which inevitably caused resentment in his heart. Therefore, he took the opportunity to retaliate, believing that there was no better plan than to harm others and benefit himself. After Cai and Zhang clarified the matter, they hired lawyers Cai Liucheng and Sun Yuan to file a criminal lawsuit against Xing, accusing him of spreading rumors and using forged documents, and demanding severe punishment. The First Special District Court has held two hearings on the case, but no verdict has been reached. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui continued the trial, but the most important witnesses, such as the staff of the telegraph bureau's reception and dispatch department, and the person who drafted the telegraph draft at the defendant's silk firm, did not appear in court, so important facts could not be reliably proven, and it was difficult to proceed with the trial. Judge Liu ordered a postponement of the case and a summons for the witnesses to be questioned again.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Bureau of Weights and Measures Notifies that Prices Should be Marked in the New System <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Weights and Measures sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that: "We have received instruction No. 5278 from the National Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry, which states that the conversion of prices is crucial to the promotion of the new system. Now that the country is universally unified, the recording of various price quantities should be marked according to the new system, such as 'per city stone,' 'city dan,' 'city catty,' 'city tael,' 'metric ton,' and other units, so as to deeply penetrate the public and ensure compliance. Recently, we have found that economic news published in newspapers in various places does not mark the units of 'stone' and 'dan' for various goods. It is not clear whether the new system has been changed or whether the old system is still being used, which is easily misunderstood. We hereby order the said bureau to comply immediately, contact the local chamber of commerce and trade associations, and make earnest corrections to benefit the people's livelihood." In accordance with this order, we should comply and send a letter for your reference, and request you to instruct your affiliated trade associations to comply accordingly. In the future, the recording of various price quantities in the economic news of newspapers in our city should be marked according to the new system, such as "per city stone," "city dan," "city catty," "city tael," "metric ton," and other units, so as to show unification and benefit the people's livelihood. It is sincerely public friendship, it said. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has transferred the letter to the various trade associations for compliance.</p>

<p>Recently, some companies and stores in this city have been issuing lottery tickets without authorization. Although the government has repeatedly prohibited this, some have still failed to comply. The Municipal Government specifically issued a notice yesterday strictly prohibiting this. The text is recorded as follows: "Issuing lottery tickets without government approval is a violation of criminal law. Furthermore, collecting money and using lotteries to allow people to gain profit by chance has long been prohibited. However, recently, various companies and stores in this city have been cleverly devising names and issuing lottery tickets or similar things without authorization. Such rampant speculation and its extreme harm are beyond imagination. All lottery tickets and similar methods that have not been approved by the government should be strictly prohibited, and they should not be advertised in newspapers to prevent malpractice. We hereby issue this notice for general knowledge, and everyone must abide by it without fail. Sincerely, this notice."</p>

<h3 id="e173">Cha Ruilong Accused of Embezzling Inheritance; Inquiry Against Cha Ruanyun Unsuccessful, Hearing Rescheduled <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Cha Ruilong, a strongman who is currently a shareholder and director of the China Film Company, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by his cousin, Cha Ruiyun, through lawyers Zhu Sifu, Yang Ruinian, and Li Mian, on criminal charges of embezzling inheritance. The facts of the lawsuit are as follows: The plaintiff's father, De Cun, and Cha Ruilong's father, De Yuan, were brothers with the same parents. They owned ancestral land worth more than 100,000 yuan. Because De Yuan and De Cun were close brothers, they never divided the property. De Yuan managed it, and they were harmonious and had no disputes. In 1917, De Cun died of illness, leaving behind a five-year-old son, Rui Lian. In less than four years, Rui Lian's mother also passed away, so De Yuan raised Rui Lian. Not long after, De Yuan and his wife passed away one after another. All the property of both families was managed by Ruilong. At that time, Ruilian was not yet an adult and was still studying. Unexpectedly, Ruilong was stingy with tuition fees and ordered him to learn typesetting. Rui Lian did not want to, so he was instead ordered to work as a waiter at the National Hotel to support himself. He did not give any of the property that his cousin should have received. Rui Lian was still young and did not dispute this. It was not until the year before last that Cha Ruilong's sister, Xin Yuan, sued the district court because her brother did not divide the inheritance. As a result, more than 50,000 yuan of De Yuan's inheritance was fully divided and it was stated that the remaining 50,000 yuan of inheritance was under De Cun's name, so it could not be divided. Now that Rui Lian is older, he has repeatedly demanded that Ruilong return the inheritance, but has been refused. Rui Lian believes that Ruilong is actually embezzling the inheritance, so he filed a lawsuit, requesting that he be punished according to Article 356 of the Criminal Law. The First Special District Court held a hearing on this case yesterday afternoon. Cha Ruilong was not found after investigation, so the plaintiff's representative, lawyer Yang Ruinian, stated that the defendant's address was initially unclear, but it has now been found that he lives at No. 1105 behind the Jinsidu Temple on Kangnuot Road. The court stated that the defendant had not been summoned, so it was difficult to proceed, and ordered that the case be rescheduled so that the plaintiff could summon the defendant to court for further verification.</p>

<p>In Xinjing, northwest of Shanghai, the Chenggeng Industrial Work Study Group was founded last autumn by Huang Jingwan, Chen Binhe, and others. This spring, Mr. Yang from the Zhejiang Cotton Improvement Farm sent over ten catties of "Million China Cotton" seeds, which the farm director of the Industrial Work Study Group, Zhu Haoming, instructed Guo Genshan, a farmer from Majiaqiao near the farm, to plant as a trial. The planting method for "Million China Cotton" is similar to that of local native cotton, and other procedures are also the same. It has now been fully harvested. Compared with local native cotton, "Million China Cotton" is very superior. Moreover, the original seeds of "Million China Cotton" were collected from Wusong, so it is very suitable for the climate and soil of the four suburban districts of Shanghai. Currently, Guo Genshan has kept dozens of catties of "Million Cotton" seeds for his own planting. The remaining seeds will be distributed by Zhu from the Industrial Work Study Group to other farmers for planting next spring as a preliminary attempt at promotion.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Painter Becomes a Swindler: Shi Zhixun, Only Eighteen Years Old, Willingly Degenerates: Uses Ignorant Children to Swindle Goods from Various Stores <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, at around 9 AM, a customer suddenly came to Ruichangxiang Leather Goods Store at No. 45 Jiuxiaochang in Xinbeimen and used Feng Xianming (nine years old), the son of a Shaoxing woman, Feng Chen, who lived at No. 223 Xueyuan Road, to swindle two pieces of sheepskin, worth more than 50 yuan, and then escaped without a trace. The store then reported to the Second Division of the First District, and a report was prepared to send the Feng family to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for questioning. Unexpectedly, at around 8 PM in the evening, a customer about twenty years old also came to Huacheng Odds and Ends Store at No. 152 Sanpailou in the city, along with a child about ten years old, who looked like siblings. He said he wanted to buy gray squirrels, so the store owner, Xu Songquan from Hangzhou, took out many gray squirrels for him to choose from. The customer selected twelve of them (priced at more than 30 yuan). Later, he claimed that these gray squirrels had to be taken home for his parents to see before he could make a decision, but since they did not know each other, he asked his nephew (referring to the child he brought) to wait in the store for a while and he would be back soon. The store did not suspect anything because he wanted to take the goods to see and left his nephew in the store to wait, so he let the customer take them away. Unexpectedly, he waited until about 9 PM and the customer still did not return. The child left in the store suddenly cried loudly. Xu immediately questioned him about his background. He claimed that his name was Xu Jinbao, he was ten years old, from Nanjing, and lived at No. 43 Sanpailou. The person who brought me here did not know me. I met him on the way, and he bought me many pieces of milk candy, gave them to me, and brought me here to play. Now I want to go home, etc. Only then did the store realize that it had been deceived, so it called the police on duty and took the child to the Second Division of the First District for questioning. Then, at around 10 PM, Dai Wenhua, an employee of Ruichangxiang Leather Goods Store, and Sun Shizhen, an employee of Hengchangxiang Leather Goods Store at No. 128 Jiuxiaochang, went out on business and happened to see the teenager who had swindled the sheepskin walking near Xinbeimen. They immediately stepped forward and took him to the Second Division of the First District. Yesterday morning, when Director Liu was conducting a preliminary trial, Dai stated the circumstances of the store being swindled of the two pieces of sheepskin. Xu Songquan, the owner of Huacheng Odds and Ends Store, identified the teenager who had swindled the sheepskin in the store as the person who had come to the store this morning to swindle the gray squirrels. Sun Shizhen, an employee of Hengchangxiang Leather Goods Store, also stated that the store had previously been swindled of a piece of sheepskin by the same method. Then, Li Caibao, the local owner of Lifuxing Leather Shoe Store at No. 364 Fangbang Road, filed a case, identifying the teenager as having come to the store at around 11 AM on the 20th of this month and swindled two pairs of leather shoes. When questioned, the teenager claimed his name was Shi Zhidong, he was eighteen years old, from Chongming, and lived at No. 36 Xueyuan Road. He used to be a painter in Qingyunge at No. 104 Jiuxiaochang, specializing in painting various types of Chinese paintings. He is now unemployed and has difficulty making a living, so he had no choice but to resort to this strategy. All the goods he swindled have been pawned and used, he said. Considering that the person has swindled goods from other stores, it is decided that it is not limited to Ruichangxiang Leather Goods Store and several other stores. In addition to sending the police to investigate the deceived businesses in detail, a report will be prepared to send all the people involved to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Chinese and Foreign Pharmacy Drug Case Involves Zhang Wanrong: Zhang Claims His Real Name is Wanrong, Used Zhang Surname to Change Certificate: Court Still Needs to Investigate <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Pharmacy at No. 69 Guangdong Road was previously searched by the competent police force on May 10, 1931 for privately selling morphine. A large amount of drugs were found in the pharmacy, and the store owner, Qiao Ziyun from Datuan, Pudong, was arrested. After a final trial by the First Special District Local Court, the defendants were sentenced to imprisonment and the drugs were destroyed. However, a land business license was found at the time of the search, which was filled in under the name of Zhang Wanrong. No one claimed it until the case was closed, so it was temporarily attached to the file. Later, someone claiming to be Zhang Wanrong hired a lawyer to apply for the return of the certificate, but the court at that time still retained the certificate because Qiao Ziyun's fine had not been paid. Now that Qiao has been released from prison and other procedures have been completed, the person claiming to be Zhang Wanrong has hired a lawyer to apply again. The judge of the execution court discovered, after reviewing the file, that Qiao Ziyun had stated during the court hearing that his accomplice Zhang Changgui was Zhang Wanrong. The judge in charge of the Qiao case issued an arrest warrant for Zhang, as he was on the run. Now that the suspect dares to come forward, he should be investigated strictly. The address was checked according to his statement and the competent police force was notified to send detectives to Rongchangxiang Watch Store at No. 190 Fujian Road to arrest Zhang Wanrong and to verify that the watch store was opened by Zhang. In addition to running this business, he also serves as a compradore for the Japanese Hattori Trading Company. He is exceptionally respectful to the Japanese owner on weekdays and is deeply trusted by the employer. He has been in the position for more than 20 years, so his family has also become wealthy. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Special Court by the police force. After Court President Qian Hongye questioned him, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case and requested that Zhang be temporarily detained, as the police force still needed to investigate everything. Zhang Wanrong hired a lawyer to defend himself, saying that his real name was Wanrong, not Zhang Wanrong. The reason why he called himself Zhang Wanrong was that he partnered with Zhang Changgui in the real estate business that year and bought a piece of land. When he went to the Land Bureau to change the business license, he used Changgui's surname and Wanrong's name to form the three characters "Zhang Wanrong" and filled it in the certificate as the account name. Therefore, he applied for the return of the business license under the name of Zhang Wanrong this time. Qiao Ziyun's statement that his accomplice Zhang Wanrong must be someone else, etc. Judge Qian questioned Zhang himself, and he made the same statement. The court believed that it was necessary to conduct a detailed investigation to determine whether it was a pretext or sophistry. Zhang Wanrong was ordered to pay a bail of 3,000 yuan for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Ju Shoubai from Jingjiang owns a four-masted large sand ship, which is used to transport piglets and miscellaneous goods from his hometown to various ports for sale. On the 11th of this month, he loaded 156 piglets and dozens of packages of peanuts from his hometown and sailed to Ningbo for sale under the supervision of Du Yusheng and ten other crew members. At 3 AM on the 13th, when sailing to the sea off Chuansha shoal, about 40 to 50 miles outside Wusongkou, it was dark when the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co.'s coal ship Katsuragiyama Maru came head-on and sailed in at high speed. The Ju ship tried to avoid it urgently, but the ship was moving too fast and was violently struck on the stern. The ship was completely shattered, especially the fifth cabin, which suffered the most damage. The entire cabin was flooded, and most of the piglets drowned. Du Dada fractured his knee. The ship was about to sink. After causing the accident, the ship dropped anchor and inspected the Ju ship, ordering the crew to find a way to force the ship to the shoal and saying that the matter would be resolved after arriving in Shanghai. After speaking, it weighed anchor and sailed to Shanghai, berthing at the Huatong Wharf in Pudong to unload its cargo. After the accident, ten people were left to guard the ship. Crew member Xiang Yousheng returned to his hometown alone and came to Shanghai yesterday with shipowner Ju Shoubai to claim compensation.</p>

A report was filed with the General Bureau, and a request was made to issue a notice to all districts to assist in the arrest of the fleeing robbers and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Chen Zhikui, the owner of Qianfengtai Incense Candle Store at No. 52 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, returned to the store from outside at around 8 PM on April 29 of this year. After a while, he detoured through the small alley next to the store to return to his home. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly shot by thugs in the alley, and the bullet hit his throat, killing him instantly. Chen Qiancheng, the accountant in the store, heard the alarm and rushed out to rescue him, but he was also shot in several places and sent to the hospital for treatment. Later, special agents from the French Police Force arrested the suspect, Zhu Quanxing, from Wuxi, and sent him to the Second Special District Local Court for public prosecution on charges of murder. Chen Zhengshi, the mother of the victim, also requested an attached private prosecution to recover losses. After the trial was concluded, Zhu was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to compensate the victim's family for damages of 500 yuan. Zhu was dissatisfied with the judgment and hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. After the investigation court summoned witnesses to review the case, Judge Guo Dezhang of the Criminal Court, together with judges Fan and Sun, and the prosecutor, opened a collegiate court to hear the case yesterday afternoon at 3 PM.

The appellant was still remanded in custody pending further notice.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association Sends Letter to Assist in the Case of Chen Zhanglin's Tragic Death: Letter Sent to the Public Works Bureau Yesterday to Uphold Justice <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhanglin, an employee of Erwo Leather Gloves Company, went out to buy goods on the 22nd of this month. While passing through the area of Wenzhiji Si Tuolu on Suzhou Road, he was struck by falling wood from the Dachang Construction Factory, which hit Chen Zhanglin on the head. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but died the next day. The company believes that Dachang Factory was negligent and should be held responsible for negligent homicide. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai to request assistance. The reporter of Heping News Agency learned that the Association had transferred the letter to the Public Works Bureau, requesting it to uphold justice and initiate a public prosecution. The original letter is recorded below: Dear Sirs, According to a letter from Erwo Leather Gloves Company, our company's employee Chen Zhanglin, a native of Jiangshan, Ningbo, aged 29, went out to buy goods at about 2 PM on October 22nd of the lunar calendar. More than ten minutes later, a neighbor came to report that Chen Zhanglin had been struck on the head by falling wood from the Dachang Construction Factory building the Bank of China on Suzhou Road, resulting in brain matter flowing out. The Chinese police officer No. 304 and special patrol officer immediately called Renji Hospital and ordered an ambulance to take him to the hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries on the morning of the 23rd. Upon investigation, the cause was that the newly built bamboo fence of the Dachang Construction Factory was not secure, resulting in the tragedy. The Public Works Bureau stipulates that bamboo fences must be erected for building construction to protect the public from danger. Now the factory's fence was not secure and caused the disaster, which is a violation of the Public Works Bureau's regulations and cannot be held without due responsibility. Chen Zhanglin's death, although not intentional murder by Dachang Factory, is undoubtedly negligent homicide. Since the factory has committed a criminal offense, the Public Works Bureau should be requested to initiate a public prosecution to maintain the law and to ensure the safety and tranquility of the public in the future. Therefore, we especially ask your association to forward a letter to the Public Works Bureau, requesting it to deal with Dachang Construction Factory strictly. Fortunately, do not neglect it. However, Chen Zhanglin has a senile mother above, a young and weak wife in the middle, and young children below. The family relies on his life. How can we take care of his descendants? The situation is tragic and pitiful, etc. Chen Zhanglin suffered a tragic misfortune, which was indeed caused by the insecure fence. The Dachang Factory cannot shirk its responsibility. According to the foregoing circumstances, it is requested that your Public Works Bureau examine and verify the facts, uphold justice, and initiate a public prosecution to avenge the deceased and rely on the living. We hope that this request can be honored (Heping News Agency).</p>

<p>Chen Ronggui (38 years old), an employee of the textile department of the German Miye Foreign Company at No. 16 Guangdong Road in the Public Concession, lived at No. 126 Jiuxiaochang in Xinbeimen. It was his habit to leave early and return late every day. Chen's wife, Huang (40 years old), had two sons and five daughters, and their lives were still warm and full. Unexpectedly, at 5 PM on May 12th of this year, while returning home from the company, while passing in front of the Lao Jiatai Tea Shop at No. 46 Lao Beimen Street in the French Concession, a giant piece of wood, more than ten feet long, fell from the roof of the shop, striking him on the head. He became dizzy and fell to the ground. A nearby Chinese police officer found him and took Chen to the police station, which transferred him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries. The court verified the incident and summoned the tea shop's employees to the scene, who admitted that the wood did fall from the roof of the shop. Later, the deceased's mother, Chen Zhang (67 years old), and wife, Chen Huang, hired lawyers Shen Yi, Wang Jianfan, and Lu Hongyi to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court, accusing Pan Jucai and others of the tea shop of causing death due to negligence, requesting that they be punished according to the law, and filing an accompanying civil suit, requesting that they be ordered to compensate all losses. The court judges repeatedly summoned the plaintiff and defendant to the case for questioning and instructed both parties to try to reach a settlement, but it did not succeed. Unexpectedly, the second plaintiff, Chen Huang, fell ill due to depression because of her husband's tragic death and died on the seventh day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. It is now known that Chen's family has left behind an old mother and seven children, as well as an unmarried sister of the deceased (51 years old). In order to provide food for the living and comfort the spirits of the dead, they have hired lawyer Zhu Gaorong to request the court to uphold justice, order the defendant to compensate all losses of more than 50,000 yuan, and maintain the lives of the nine members of the family. After the court received the complaint, it scheduled a hearing at 1:30 PM today to summon the plaintiff and defendant to the case for trial (Guomin News Agency).</p>
<h3 id="e188">Rice Boat Robbed - Sheng Jintao Cleaned Out - Rural Boatmen's Conversation Causes Disaster <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Sheng Jintao's rice boat loaded 200 dan of white rice from the Yi Sheng Xiang firm in Jiahu, to be transported to Shanghai for sale by a rice merchant named Lu. Due to market conditions, the firm urged Sheng's boat to travel quickly, so as to arrive in Shanghai early for sale. However, on the afternoon before yesterday, when sailing to the 18-li-long Pu surface of the Nanhuangpu, it was getting late. Sheng, seeing that the Pu surface had many bends and would be difficult to navigate at night, noticed several cargo boats heading south anchored there for the night. Therefore, he also sailed to the Pu bank and anchored. He further saw a rural boat anchored in front of Sheng's boat, only a few feet away, outside the cargo boats staying overnight. Sheng didn't suspect anything, and the crew members chatted with the people on the rural boat. Unexpectedly, when dawn broke yesterday morning, all the cargo boats that had stayed overnight there had already sailed away. Sheng instructed the crew to get up and prepare to sail, but they saw four or five people on the shore running down to the rural boat, which immediately sailed to the side of Sheng's boat. Seven or eight people jumped aboard, threatened the boatmen with guns, preventing them from making noise, and drove all the crew members into the cabin. They asked who the boat owner was, but the crew didn't answer and were beaten with sticks. Sheng knew they were robbers and said, "Our boat is carrying passengers and goods, and we only take the water fare. The goods must be delivered to Shanghai. You can take the money." He handed over ten yuan in cash he had in his pocket, but the robbers didn't believe him and searched everywhere. They smashed open a suitcase and robbed seventy or eighty yuan. The robbers thought Sheng was unusually cunning, dragged him out and beat him severely, demanding that he quickly hand over any hidden silver. Sheng told them that he had no other silver hidden anywhere. Then, another small boat came. The robbers opened the cabin and began to move the rice into the two small boats. When they were full and could not hold any more, the robbers stopped. The robbers jumped onto the two small boats, fired a shot into the air as they left, and then sped east towards Pudong. After the robbers left, the crew members came out of the cabin and saw that Sheng was seriously injured. Sheng was from Shenglonghua Shengqiao, so they sailed the boat to Shengqiao and sent Sheng home, where he was treated by a doctor. More than ten shi of rice were robbed. In the afternoon, the crew informed rice merchant Lu, requesting that the authorities be notified to arrest the robbers and recover the stolen goods.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Lin Yaoxuan Encounters a "Honey Trap" - Case Adjourned for Retrial <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Lin Yaoxuan from Sichuan, who runs a white fungus and foreign goods business in Shanghai, was introduced by Hu Ruiting, a foreign goods broker he knew, to Shen Wu, the wife of Shen Shou Kang, the owner of the Jiankang Hospital at 25 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and had a secret affair. They had trysts several times in rooms at the Zhongnan and Dahu hotels. On the afternoon of the 29th of last month at 2 p.m., Hu arranged for Lin and Shen to meet at the Central Hotel in room 523 for another liaison. As soon as Lin and Shen entered the room, Hu made an excuse to leave, colluding with Shen Shou Kang, Chen Fuliang, Li Hong, and three or four others to rush to the Central Hotel and extort money from Lin. They then kidnapped Lin to the law office of Zhang Wei on Avenue Edward VII, forcing him to write two IOU notes for 500 yuan each and taking his watch and cash before releasing him. Lin believed that Hu, Chen, and the others had deliberately set up a "honey trap" to extort money, so he reported it to the French police. The detectives arrested Chen Fuliang, Li Hong, and Hu Ruiting, and retrieved the IOU notes and watch as evidence, sending them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Later, Shen Shou Kang and his wife, knowing they could not evade responsibility, surrendered to the police and were sent to the court for prosecution. Judge Zhang Chaozuo repeatedly held court sessions to try the cases together. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held. At noon, Judge Zhang summoned witnesses in Criminal Court No. 1 for questioning. Liu Jingcai, a waiter from the Zhongnan Hotel, and Xu Yiming, a waiter from the Central Hotel, brought the circular ledger to testify about Lin Yaoxuan's entering rooms with Shen and Hu. After questioning both the plaintiffs and defendants, as it was past 1 p.m., the court adjourned the hearing to be rescheduled. The defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>

<p>The Shanghai office of the China Sino-Foreign Relief Association believes that the Yellow River's overflowing and breaching of dikes has submerged over fifty counties in southern Hebei, eastern Henan, and western Shandong. Rural buildings, farming tools, and seeds have been completely destroyed, leaving three million victims without food or clothing, urgently in need of aid. Although the National Government's Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, various charitable organizations, and the Association's Beijing headquarters have actively raised funds and provided emergency relief in the disaster areas, the fundamental solution is to restore rural organization. It has been decided to establish rural mutual aid societies and cooperatives in the Yellow River disaster areas in stages, sending personnel to the most severely affected areas to handle the matter on the ground, in order to restore rural organization and finance. Currently, Mr. An Xianjin (English), a British executive, and Mr. Shen Mingsan, a Chinese executive, are working together to actively raise relief funds from Chinese and foreign philanthropists, with the aim of implementing this plan in the shortest possible time. Furthermore, the Disaster Relief Group of the National Government's Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee has purchased 100,000 sets of cotton-padded clothing for distribution. The first batch of 20,000 sets was shipped to the disaster areas of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces on the 15th for distribution. The second batch of 20,000 sets has also been delivered and departed last night.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Accusation of Illegally Selling Lottery Tickets <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Da Shun Tobacco and Paper Store located at No. 79, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, was recently found by the French police to be selling Panay brand and other cigarettes with lottery tickets attached at the retail price of 120 cash per pack, violating the regulations against private sales of lottery tickets. Detectives were dispatched to search the store and found hundreds of lottery tickets. The store owner, Rong Fanrong, and his assistant, Lu Yaojiang, were arrested and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for public prosecution. Judge Qiu interrogated the defendants, who admitted to the illegal sale of lottery tickets in violation of regulations and were instructed to await a scheduled sentencing. The defendants were released on bail pending further instructions. Yesterday morning, the date for sentencing arrived. The defendants appeared in court to await sentencing. The court found that there were still doubts in the case that needed to be further investigated, so the final arguments were revoked and a retrial was scheduled for the 25th. The defendants remained released on their original bail pending further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Mr. and Mrs. Haiberg Depart Shanghai for India <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The German Haiberg Circus will be performing in India in a few weeks. Mr. Haiberg, the head of the troupe, and his wife, are scheduled to depart for India today to make preliminary arrangements. Mr. Haiberg, who has traveled the world, felt particularly attached to China during his stay in Shanghai for about twenty days. He was extremely busy with social engagements, making new acquaintances and renewing old friendships. Before leaving, he told reporters that he had traveled the world with his circus troupe, but he felt particularly attached to China. He added that the Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai had shown great kindness and support to the circus troupe, making the performances very popular. He was deeply grateful for this kindness and hoped to return in the future with even grander and more advanced performances.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Haiberg left Shanghai, he sent several representatives to various parts of China to collect various rare and exotic birds and animals, making the menagerie even more complete. All troupe affairs during the remaining performance period in Shanghai will be managed by the general manager, Mr. Schaevitz.</p>
<p>Haiberg and his circus have been performing in Shanghai for some time, and the history of his childhood is of great interest to us. Even as a child, he was exceptionally brave. At the age of thirteen, he once entered a cage containing no fewer than twenty kinds of ferocious beasts, such as lions and tigers. His father, catching sight of this, rushed to pull him out, and thereafter forbade him from mingling with the animals to prevent danger. His father was a great circus owner and later sent someone to India to buy animals. Haiberg accompanied him, marking his first trip to India. Later, this person fell ill, so the young and inexperienced Haiberg had to take full responsibility for the transport. There were twelve elephants, four hundred monkeys, three hundred snakes, and many other birds and animals, all to be transported to Germany, which was no easy task. Later, Haiberg went alone to Africa to buy five hundred ostriches, which were crammed into a small boat. The suffering of crowding and filth is hard to imagine, but he remained calm. Crossing the Cape of Good Hope, a great storm made progress even more difficult. The voyage took a total of thirty-nine days to reach its destination on the way home. Such was the hardship of the work. Now that we see his magnificent menagerie and observe his decisiveness in handling affairs as a child, we know that his success is not without cause. Since the Haiberg Circus began performing in Shanghai, the people of Shanghai have been amazed by the spectacle and marveled at his incredible animal training techniques. Now, for the sake of increasing the knowledge of circus enthusiasts, the "Chen Bao" and the Chinese Art and Science Society have specially invited Mr. Schaevitz, the manager of the Haiberg Circus, and Mr. Haiberg's son, Herbert Haiberg, to give a public lecture in the auditorium of the Chinese Art and Science Society at No. 45 Avenue Amiral Foch on October 26th (today) at 3:30 p.m., with the topic "How to Train Various Animals". Mr. Schaevitz has been the general manager of the troupe for forty-five years and is very familiar with the situation in various countries. During the lecture, he will reveal all the secrets of training, which will surely be welcomed by the general audience. Starting at 4 p.m., the Educational Film Association will also screen films at the Chinese Art and Science Society, including educational, industrial, and humorous films, which will further increase the interest of the audience.</p>

<p>The Zhi Zhong Bank, newly established at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Henan Road, officially opened yesterday. The bank's location was formerly the site of the Kenye Bank. After being renovated by the new bank, it is magnificent and completely renewed. Yesterday was the day of the opening, and because the bank's directors and supervisors are giants in the financial world and experts in economics, with well-established reputations, those who came to congratulate were all well-known industrial and commercial groups, institutions, and important figures from home and abroad. The traffic was bustling, and the scene was extremely grand. As for the gifts from various circles, they were even more dazzling, embellished with embroidery, and radiant with glory. Chairman Song Hanzhang, along with the directors, supervisors, manager Shi Jiuyuan, and deputy manager Chen Zishou, were all able to welcome guests with grace and courtesy, filling the hall with joy. As for the crowding for deposits and the flourishing of business, they were merely secondary matters.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Chinese Factory Federation Plans National Goods Movement Fair - Site Selected on Avenue Foch in the French Concession - Actively Preparing for Opening Soon <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District National Goods Movement Fair, organized by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Federation to awaken citizens to promote national goods, is scheduled to last for two months. It is said that the site has been selected near the Guanghua Theater on Avenue Foch in the French Concession. The plan is roughly divided into two parts: one is an exhibition hall to collect and display national products from various factories for public viewing, and the other is a temporary market, which will be divided into one hundred rooms, graded A, B, and C according to the quality of the location. The Federation's planned categories for displaying national products from factories are as follows: silk, cloth, woolen fabrics, broadcloth, cotton wool, knitwear, rubber products, leather goods, felt hats, ties, shirts, arts and crafts, lacquerware, paper umbrellas, cloth umbrellas, toothbrushes, candy, food, cosmetics, toys, educational products, silk landscapes, jewelry, thermos bottles, combs, electrical appliances, copperware, glassware, rattanware, soap, scissors, enamelware, steelware, medical supplies, ceramics, waterproof cloth raincoats, clocks and watches, leather goods, and 33 other types of goods. At that time, in order to increase the interest of visitors, it is planned to set up an amusement park to perform various entertainments. The official opening date will be determined once the preparations are complete.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Investigation Report on the Qidong Disaster <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society and the Sino-Foreign Relief Association jointly organized emergency relief for the Qidong disaster, publicly recommending members Qiu and Lu as the director and deputy director, along with relief workers, to go and investigate the disaster. According to the report received after they left, on the 18th of this month, Director Zhang Shunru of the Education Bureau accompanied them to Jiangxia Village, District 8, as the starting point of the disaster area in the southeast. The area is known for producing cotton. After two hurricanes, seawater surged in, with the water level being over ten feet high outside the embankment and four, five, six, or seven feet high inside the embankment. As a result, the seawater soaked cotton fields and cotton stalks, resulting in absolutely no harvest. At that time, one or two hundred people were swept away by the seawater, with no trace of their bodies. There are names and corpses for more than 380 others. Grass huts within the outer embankment have been completely washed away, with no rice, no clothes, and no homes. They are begging for food in the inland areas. Those who are stronger are either helping with work or seeking help from relatives and friends to make a living. Due to the soil being exposed to saltwater, they have no hope of planting anything next year. The local authorities are discussing post-disaster relief measures, but the only way is to rebuild the outer embankment, using labor as relief, widening and raising it based on the old foundation, about nine thousand feet or more. However, this requires a huge amount of money, which is planned to be collected from local land taxes from the owners. There is still a shortfall, and they are requesting the Shanghai charitable organizations to provide assistance. If this embankment is successful, future disasters can be prevented. However, the Jiang embankment is not included. The local authorities are surveying and estimating these two engineering plans after measuring, and are actively carrying them out with the efforts of everyone. However, there are currently forty to fifty thousand disaster victims waiting to be fed, and the Association's relief funds are insufficient for distribution. It is hoped that more funds will be raised to provide relief. It is said that the Association first loaded 1,700 shi of Xian rice and 2,500 sets of new cotton clothing and transported them to the disaster area for distribution, but it is like a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. It is hoped that philanthropists at home and abroad will generously donate to save lives.</p>

<p>In October of this year, the Ministry of Education compiled vocational education laws, which are divided into the following: 1. The educational objectives of the Republic of China and their implementation guidelines; 2. Methods for determining the trend of educational implementation; 3. Proposals for determining the trend of educational facilities; 4. A general order to all provinces and cities to restrict the establishment of ordinary middle schools and increase the establishment of vocational schools, adding vocational departments or vocational subjects to ordinary middle schools, and requiring county junior middle schools to establish or transform into rural normal schools and vocational departments; 5. Implementation plans for establishing secondary agricultural and industrial schools in various provinces and cities; 6. Vocational School Law; 7. Vocational School Regulations, Vocational Supplementary School Regulations; 9. Outlines of methods for education administrative organs and primary and secondary schools in various provinces and cities to implement guidance on further education and careers; 10. Methods for setting up standards for the establishment and funding allocation of secondary schools in various provinces and cities; 11. Procedures for promoting vocational education in various provinces and cities; 12. Methods for registering, examining, and training vocational school teachers in various provinces and cities; 13. Outlines of teaching subjects and hours for each discipline in vocational schools, which have been announced separately by the government and the ministry. However, 14. Resolutions of the Ministry of Education's Vocational Education Design Committee, which are divided into three items: "Principles of Vocational School Facilities," "Standards of Vocational School Facilities," and "Standards of Vocational School Student Internships," are quite important and have not been disclosed in detail. It is worthwhile to publish them as a supplement. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e206">▲Principles of Vocational School Facilities <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(A) Regarding establishment: 1. Local education administrative organs should base the establishment of vocational schools at all levels on adapting to social needs and ensuring that students have adequate career prospects. 2. Before establishing vocational schools at all levels, local education administrative organs should conduct detailed surveys of social conditions and determine the standards for setting up school subjects. 3. Before establishing vocational schools at all levels, they should consult with local industrial organizations or establish them jointly. 4. Before establishing vocational schools at all levels, there should be detailed and concrete plans, as well as predicted future effects. 5. Education administrative organs should emphasize the actual effectiveness of vocational school expansion, not the exaggeration of quantity.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding equipment and funding: 1. Vocational schools at all levels must have substantial equipment and places for practice, so the start-up costs must be sufficient. 2. The places for practice in vocational schools at all levels must be able to accommodate all students for practice. 3. The recurring expenses of vocational schools at all levels should be limited to the most economical extent possible within the scope. The annual recurring expenses for a single-subject, single-grade should be based on an increase of 50% for provincial junior or senior middle schools in the local area as a principle. 4. The recurring expenses of vocational schools at all levels must have preparations for gradual expansion each year. (C) Regarding teachers: 1. Vocational school teachers must have extremely rich experience in specialized techniques. If there are no qualified teachers, technicians with rich experience and ordinary teachers will jointly teach. 2. Vocational school teachers must first demonstrate work and work with students, and then provide practical guidance. 3. The teaching methods of vocational school teachers must have concrete plans and determine the expected goals.</p>
<p>▲(D) Regarding students: (1) The aspirations of vocational school students should be based on serving in the vocational industry after graduation. (2) The age and qualifications of vocational school students should be slightly broader than the entrance qualifications for ordinary schools. (3) The graduation years of vocational school students must be very flexible, and being able to directly serve in the vocational industry should be the graduation standard.</p>
<p>▲(E) Regarding academic subjects, practice, and training: (1) The training of vocational school students should emphasize character cultivation, physical training, and vocational training equally, and special attention should be paid to character cultivation. (2) The working environment in which vocational students receive training should be consistent with the actual working environment in the future. (3) Vocational school students must strive to develop their ability to develop automatically. (4) Vocational school subjects are divided into general subjects, vocational subjects, and practice, and practice time must account for at least half of the total time. (5) Vocational school student practice materials, in addition to practicing basic work, should practice materials with commodity value, but excessive repetition should be avoided as much as possible, and the principle of manual work first and then machinery should be followed. (6) The products of vocational school student practice should be compared with social commodities to determine their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="e207">▲Standards for Vocational School Facilities ▲1. Types of Vocational Schools <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The types of vocational schools vary from country to country around the world due to different social conditions and habits within the country. There are no clear regulations in our country regarding the types and scope of vocational schools, so those who run vocational schools have no basis to follow. The following are specially formulated:</p>
<p>(A) Scope: (1) The scope of establishing vocational schools can be divided into junior and senior levels according to the provisions of the Vocational School Law. (1) Junior vocational schools enroll primary school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications, and the length of study is one to three years, which may be shortened as necessary.

(2) A school with two vocational departments is called a junior vocational school of two certain departments. (3) A school with two or more agricultural, industrial, or commercial departments is called a junior agricultural, industrial, or commercial vocational school. (4) A school with several industries is called a junior vocational school. (2) Senior vocational schools: (1) A school with a single department is called a senior vocational school of a certain department. (2) A school with two departments is called a senior vocational school of two certain departments. (3) A school with two or more agricultural, industrial, or commercial departments is called a senior agricultural, industrial, or commercial vocational school. (4) A school with several industries is called a senior vocational school. (5) A school with both junior and senior levels is called a vocational school.</p>
<p>(C) Establishment and purpose: (1) Junior vocational schools: (1) Establishment should be based on counties and cities, but may also be established jointly by two or more counties or by private groups depending on the special circumstances of the region. (2) Purpose: (A) Junior agricultural science aims to cultivate farmers with general agricultural knowledge, so that they have the skills to operate independently, and can assist ordinary farmers to improve agriculture and rural areas.

<h3 id="e208">Second, Steps for Establishing Vocational Schools <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the operation of vocational schools in our country has rarely achieved significant results. The reasons are nothing more than the lack of clear investigation and definite plans for the local environment, and often the lack of teachers, shortage of funds, and simple equipment, so that the talents cultivated, their knowledge and skills, cannot be as ideal as expected. Even if there are a few outstanding students, they cannot meet the needs of the environment, and they feel that it is difficult to find a way out. Therefore, we should be cautious at the beginning. The establishment of vocational schools should have prescribed steps so that graduates can truly serve the vocational industry, and then the purpose of vocational education can be achieved. The following are the proposed establishment steps:</p>

<p>(Fuzhou Telegram) Since Zheng Zhenwen took over as the head of the Education Department in Fujian Province last winter, funding has become increasingly tight. However, in order to expand the department's business, the number of staff members in the department has increased from 54 to more than 90. In May, the head of the department personally went to Yanping and other areas to inspect, spending only 1,500 gold coins on travel expenses. The head of the department spared no effort to economize on all public funds. Recently, the province has accumulated more than three or four months of arrears in funding, and the schools have faced a difficult situation of being unable to cook without rice. Starting this month, the schools have been demanding salaries from the department. Recently, teachers and staff from various schools have been sitting at the Education Department to demand salaries. The head of the department came out to meet them, and there was a slight misunderstanding in the language, which led to a dispute. It is widely rumored that there is a strike, but this is not the case. It has now come to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Chen Zixin's Enthusiasm for Labor Education <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zixin, the manager of Hengda Cotton Mill in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, is known for his enthusiasm for public welfare. Since assuming the position of municipal committee member of the Yangsi District, he has been praised by local people. Recently, in view of the fact that some young child laborers in the factory are engaged in labor, which is detrimental to their physical development, and considering that they are at the age when they should be studying, he built a school building on the remaining land of the Yangsi District Municipal Committee Office this summer and founded a worker's supplementary school. More than 100 young child laborers were ordered to stop working and enroll in the school to receive educational opportunities and work skills training. They are divided into two groups, A and B, according to their age. Group A graduates in two years, and Group B graduates in three years. After graduation, they are sent to work in the factory and receive higher wages. If their academic performance is excellent and they are aspiring to further their studies, they will be subsidized according to the school's scholarship program for further education. All children's books and supplies are provided free of charge by the school. To show consideration for the poor families of the students, each student receives a monthly subsidy of two yuan for household expenses. Those with fewer absences or excellent grades are subject to a separate bonus system. The school's expenses are all raised by Chen himself. The school opened on October 1st. In addition, for the male and female workers working in the factory, it is planned to set up separate classes according to the methods of the public schools, with two hours of reading per day. This is currently being planned. It is reported that the school has printed its articles of association to promote this effort, so that factory owners who are enthusiastic about labor education can request copies for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Loss of Four Provinces Affects Northeastern Students Studying Abroad. Qin Guoding Returns Home in a Distressed State. ▲ Carrying a Letter from the Consulate in Germany Requesting Relief from the Refugee Association. ▲ A Glimpse of the Economic Interruption Causing Financial Difficulty for Students Dropping Out of School in Germany. <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Since the successive fall of the four northeastern provinces, the impact on self-funded students from the Northeast studying abroad has been significant, as all tuition and travel expenses have been cut off. This situation not only affects their studies, but also leaves some stranded overseas without a home. The Northeastern Refugee Relief Association in this city received Qin Guoding (from Liaoyang), a student studying in Germany, yesterday who was sent back to China by the Chinese Consul in Germany for the same reasons. The Consul specially issued a letter of certification, ordering him to request relief from the association. His situation is extremely difficult. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e220">▲ The Journey Home <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Qin Guoding, a student studying in Germany, is 22 years old and from Liaoyang, Northeast China. He graduated from Northeastern University at an early age and went to Germany at his own expense to study advanced industrial science at the University of Berlin. The planned study period was eight years. Since the September 18th Incident, followed by the postal blockade in the Northeast, Qin's expenses in Germany were exhausted. However, at that time, Qin did not want to drop out of school because his studies were not completed. He borrowed money from classmates and worked part-time in Germany to barely manage to graduate, and his situation was extremely difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e221">▲ Request for Relief <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>In August of this year (only one semester away from graduation), he was finally unable to make ends meet. He appealed to the Chinese Consulate in Germany, stating his situation. The Consulate then sent him back to China at its expense and, out of pity for his homelessness after returning to China, specially prepared a letter, instructing him to go to the Shanghai Northeastern Refugee Relief Association for assistance to avoid becoming destitute. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday, Qin went to the association on Yunnan Road with the letter at 5:00 PM to request assistance. The Standing Director, Huang Bodu, met with him, offered comfort, and promised to provide relief. He also learned that the association would soon contact the Chinese Architects Association to arrange for him to apply his knowledge.</p>

<p>The original letter from the Consulate in Germany is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, This is to inform you that Qin Guoding, a student from Benxi County, Liaoning Province, has studied architecture at the Higher Institute of Technology in Berlin for seven semesters. However, since the fall of the Northeast, his tuition fees have been cut off, and he has no home to return to. His situation is extremely pitiful. This Consulate has found a way to send him back to China. After the student arrives in Shanghai, we hope that your association will find a way to provide relief to avoid him becoming destitute. Your kindness will be greatly appreciated." The Northeastern Refugee Relief Association, Embassy in Germany, August 31st.</p>

<p>The Malayan swimming team, organized by Guangdong and Hong Kong athletes, lost again to the Shanghai Western team by five to two in the third water polo match last night. The match was held at the Xiqing Swimming Pool at 7:30 PM. The audience was still crowded. Because the Western team was more familiar with the venue, had better physical fitness, and more accurate shots, they scored four goals in the first half. In the second half, the Malayan team fought bravely and scored one goal, but carelessly, the Western team scored again. In the end, the Malayan team scored a penalty goal. The final score was five to two, and the Western team won. Chen Qisong, a Malayan general, was absent due to illness and was replaced by Xu Heng, which also affected the team's strength. The list of both teams is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Malayan Team: Xu Heng, Chen Fuxing, Wang Xinmin, Huang Jiliang, Guo Zhenheng, Shi Jinpei, Yang Henghua</p>
<p>▲ Western Team: Davis, Wastoff, Johnston, Faping, Sinclair, Baron, McLester</p>

<p>Miss Yang Xiuqiong was absent, which was disappointing. The Malayan team then became three men and one woman: Chen Fuxing, Shi Jinpei, Xu Heng, and Miss Liang Yongxian. The Western team was Haite Lai, Miss Biling Si, Haimeng Te, and Miss Neil. As a result, both teams arrived at the same time, with no winner decided. The time was one minute and fifty-nine seconds. Chen Fuxing was behind Haite Lai in the 50-yard swim, but Shi Jinpei was far ahead of the opposing woman, Biling Si. In the final 50-yard swim, Liang Yongxian was ten yards ahead of Neil. Neil tried desperately to catch up, but they arrived at the same time, with no winner decided. Both sides were satisfied.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Nanjing, 25th) The Shi brothers will attempt to conquer the rapids of the Yangtze River this afternoon, swimming from Pukou to Nanjing, a distance of about ten li or three miles.</p>
<p>▲ The Shi Family Has Four Talents This is an unprecedented feat in Chinese history. At this time of year, the weather is cold, and the river water is high, making it even more dangerous. The Shi family are all famous swimmers. The eldest brother, Shi Xinglong, is known as the "Water Monster" and has represented China at the Far Eastern Games. The second brother, Shi Xingzhi, broke the national record in the 400-meter freestyle with a time of 5 minutes and 51.5 seconds and the national record in the 1500-meter freestyle with a time of 23 minutes and 27.6 seconds at this year's National Games. Miss Shi Ruisheng won fourth place in the women's 200-meter freestyle. The Shi family has four talents: three brothers and one sister, from Dalian, representing Liaoning at the National Games. All four talents will participate in today's crossing of the river.</p>

<p>In the letter submitted to the Nanjing Municipal Government requesting permission for this feat, it is stated, "We are from Liaoning Province, and we want to make the people not forget the Northeast. Therefore, we secretly returned to Nanjing to participate in the National Games. Today, the grand event has come to an end. Athletes from all over the country are returning home with smiles of victory, but we can only look at the medals and weep. We have a home, but we cannot return home. We are abandoned in this vast sports field, like homeless swallows. The fate of the country is not good, and the nation is perishing. The small island of the Eastern Neighbor has seized our three provinces. In order to awaken the people's attention to recovering the lost territory, we have completely ignored the danger and coldness of the Yangtze River's waters. Therefore, we have decided to swim from the east bank of Pukou to Nanjing on October 25th."</p>
<h3 id="e231">▲ Approved by the Nanjing Municipal Government <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Municipal Government has approved this request. To prevent accidents, it has contacted the Nanjing Police Department to make arrangements. Special police officers have been dispatched to both sides of the river to provide protection. The Navy has also dispatched a steamboat to provide protection. The eldest brother, Shi Yulong, gave his youngest sister a final warning not to participate in this feat, because although Miss Shi has a particularly strong physique and high swimming skills, her young age is a serious obstacle.</p>
<h3 id="e232">▲ The Grand Occasion of Crossing the River <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th Dispatch) The Northeastern youth swimmers Shi Xinglong, Xingzhi, and Xinglu successfully swam across the Yangtze River from Pukou on the afternoon of the 25th, arriving at the Xiaguan Ferry Terminal in 22 minutes and 27.2 seconds. Tens of thousands of Nanjing citizens watched, and more than ten thousand people stood along the riverbanks. The Shi brothers crossed the river at one o'clock and first went to the Jinpu Railway Bureau to ride the Lin Tong charter steamer with Qiu Wei, the committee chairman of the railway bureau, and representatives of the Nanjing Municipal Government to Xiaonan River, upstream of Pukou. They entered the water at 3:27 PM. Lin Tong reduced its speed and followed behind. The Ninghai Navy dispatched two speedboats, and the Capital Police Department dispatched three patrol boats. Three lifeboats from the water police patrolled to provide protection. Many spectators hired steamers or small boats to watch. At one time, the river was filled with masts and sails, creating a grand scene.</p>
<h3 id="e233">▲ Spectators Celebrate Success <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The Shi brothers were fastest on the north bank. When they reached the middle of the river, the water was turbulent, and they stood upright in the water to rest briefly. Xingxie was in the lower reaches, leading the way. The youngest brother, Xinglu, was in the middle, and the eldest brother, Xinglong, was on the right, providing protection. They were less than two meters apart. Because the bank was steep and there were many people, they changed to landing at the ferry terminal at the same time. The spectators on the river and along the coast cheered and shouted slogans celebrating their success. The entire journey was more than 3,000 meters and took less than twenty-three minutes. If they had not been affected by the waves from the small boats, and Xinglong had not had to protect Xinglu, the results would have been even better.</p>

Qiu Wei and Yu Huang, the representative of the Special Party Department of the Jinpu Railway, delivered speeches. Guest Feng Zhaoji gave a speech. Then Xinglong gave a speech. The Railway Bureau presented silver cups and iron flags. They returned at 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Zhu, a close friend of the Shi family, Xinglong graduated from a Japanese technical school and is now auditing courses at Central University. He has been swimming for six years and has won the swimming championship at the previous National Games and attended the Far Eastern Games. Xingzhi is 18 years old and is studying in the third grade of the First Middle School established by the Japanese in Dalian. He has been swimming for four years and won the 400-meter and 1500-meter championships at this year's National Games, breaking the records. Xinglu is 16 years old and is studying in the same grade as Xingzhi. He has only been swimming for three years. The youngest sister, Ruisheng, is 12 years old and has only been swimming for six months. She won fourth place in the 200-meter freestyle at this year's National Games, which can be called a genius. Ruisheng also wanted to participate in the crossing of the Yangtze River, but was dissuaded by her brother. Xingzhi, Xinglu, and Ruisheng are scheduled to leave Nanjing for Jinan and then Qingdao on the morning of the 27th and take a boat back to Dalian. Xinglong will stay in Nanjing.</p>

<p>Xu Chengji, a young tennis master from Batavia, returned from the National Games and took the opportunity to pass through Shanghai to play exhibition matches with veterans Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai. The Xu-Qiu battle was held at the Zhonghua Tennis Court at 3:00 PM yesterday. The referee was Lu Zhongen, and more than a thousand fans came to watch. Lao Qiu was惨敗to Xiao Xu in the National Games with a score of three to zero. This time, he recuperated and used his full spirit to deal with it. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and the performance was wonderful. Qiu first won the first set with six to two. Xu took back the second set with six to four and won the third set with nine to seven. The fourth set was still taken by Lao Qiu with six to three. Due to time constraints, the result was two to two. In the twilight, they parted ways. The score is as follows:</p>
<p>Six | Two</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Four | Six Xu Chengji</p>
<p>Seven | Nine</p>

<p>The tennis skills of the three musketeers, Qiu, Lin, and Xu, each have their own strengths. Lin and Xu are equal in serving, but Qiu is too weak. The baseline long draw is Qiu's specialty, and both the left and right corners have power. Xu's left corner is slightly weaker. The net interception should be attributed to Lao Lin, and the high pressure ball is especially given to Xiao Xu. Sincerely, each has its own merits, and it all depends on the opportunity and the wonderful use of it to surpass victory. Therefore, the past battles of the three heroes have created a cyclical situation. The five elements restrain each other and can generate each other. Only three heroes are competing for hegemony, and I don't know who can win the title of national player.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Qiu Feihai Goes Smoothly All the Way <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xiao Xu was delayed and did not start the game until 3:15 PM. Lao Qiu first won two games with four two four one. When it was Xiao Xu's turn to serve in the third game, he was fierce and powerful, making Lao Qiu unable to resist four times in a row. After Lao Qiu passed this level, he used his low draw skills to repeatedly oppress Xiao Xu, who retreated to the baseline. Except for the fifth game, which was still won by Xu, he went smoothly all the way and won the first set with six to two.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Xu Chengji Uses a Little Skill <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>In the second game, Xiao Xu, in view of the terrible long draw oppression of Lao Qiu, repeatedly won with serving on the one hand, and used a little skill on the other hand, lightly hitting short balls very close to the net. Lao Qiu ran east and west and could not cope, and first won two games. Qiu then fought with all his strength, creating a two-to-two tie. Later, Xu won three more high ball opportunities and one serving all-out victory, and pulled back the second set with six to four.</p>
<h3 id="e240">The Third Set Was the Most Competitive <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The third set was the most competitive between the two sides, and the performance was also the most exciting. Lao Qiu was full of energy and vigorously抽擊. Xiao Xu was patient and calm, avoiding his sharp edge, sometimes far and sometimes near, or left or right. At first, Qiu took the lead with two one three two. The sixth and seventh games were won by Xu, that is, with four three, five four, six five, and reversed the defeat to victory. Then he created a seven-to-seven tie. Finally, Xu won two more games in a row and won the third set with nine to seven.</p>
<h3 id="e241">The Fourth Set Ended Peacefully <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>The third set came to an end. Both sides rested for a while and re-entered the court. This game was a critical moment. If Xiao Xu won again, it could end. At first, Xu won a game every time he served, and had created a three-to-three tie. After the fourth game, Qiu won three games in a row and finally pulled back a game with six to three, creating a two-to-two tie. Qiu had the intention to continue the battle, but at this time it was already twilight and the evening breeze was blowing. Xiao Xu was unwilling to hurt the harmony again, so he ended the game without deciding a winner.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Qin People Have No Time to Grieve for Themselves <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>The athletes from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, who participated in the National Games held in the capital this time, when they marched in formation at the stadium, it is said that among the audience, amid "very enthusiastic" applause, many shed tears. Needless to say, in this joyful atmosphere, the reason for "shedding tears" was naturally for these athletes, who are already pitiful creatures "unable to return home." Indeed, when we read the declarations of the Northeast athletes and the speeches of Party and state figures, all with "recovering lost territories" as the backbone, even we who live in the blessed land where we have never heard the sound of cannons from the Northeast cannot help but "shed a tear of sympathy."</p>
<p>In this "Northeast War, coming to a temporary end," "remnants of Fang's troops, already suppressed," "lost counties, successively recovered," "Japanese goods imported into China, soaring," and "Sino-Japanese situation, showing promise" of a "gradually improving" period of tranquility, the National Games suddenly released such a "tear gas," I wonder if it can raise the public's "minute of fervor" again.</p>
<p>Whether "East Asian peace" can be as stable as Mount Tai under the establishment of "Manchukuo," even if "King Wen were reborn," I fear his "divine divination would be ineffective," because to maintain "East Asian peace," one must inevitably cover the entire Asian continent with the Rising Sun Flag. To achieve this, one must first eliminate the land threat from Soviet Russia and the maritime threat from the United States. Once these two major threats are eliminated, then close the door and devour the entire China alive. At that time, we young masters in this blessed land will probably be in the same position as the people of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang today, and there will be no audience to "shed a tear of sympathy" amid "very enthusiastic" applause.</p>
<p>The Qin people had no time to grieve for themselves, and later generations grieved for them. Later generations grieved for them but did not learn from them. Everyone, please close your eyes and think, what is the next sentence? The athletes from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces are already unable to return home, and we who live peacefully in this blessed land "shed tears" for them amid "very enthusiastic" applause. But we who live peacefully in this blessed land and "shed tears" for the Northeast athletes amid "very enthusiastic" applause, if "shedding tears" is all we do, everyone, please close your eyes and think, what will happen in the future?</p>
<h3 id="e252">The Secret of "Pulling" <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Yin</p>
<p>Recently, there have been articles about "pushing" and "pulling" published in the newspapers. Examining their content, they are nothing more than teaching the secrets of "pushing" and "pulling" in how to conduct oneself in the world. In fact, the way to conduct oneself is not limited to "pushing" and "pulling" alone. According to my observations, there is also a "pulling out" (拔) principle. "Pushing" means pushing others into the fire pit, and "pulling" means pulling someone up and running, like a rickshaw driver, regardless of direction. But "pulling out" is different. When someone is unsteady on their feet and walking onto the Bridge of Helplessness (奈何橋), you pull the bridge away, and the person falls into a deep abyss. This is the function of "pulling out," which is naturally different from the others.</p>
<p>"Pulling out" also has two types: "frontal pulling out" and "reverse pulling out." "Frontal pulling out" means doing things openly and pulling someone's feet out in front of them. One pull and they fall. "Reverse pulling out" means taking advantage of someone's unpreparedness, like shooting a cold arrow, pulling their feet out from behind, causing them to fall backward. However, "frontal pulling out" is not as easy as "reverse pulling out."</p>
<p>It's fine if someone doesn't want to accomplish anything in society. But if you want to accomplish something, you must steadily establish your footing, otherwise you will inevitably "end in utter failure." Suppose you only care about appearances, even if you are outstanding and have great strength, do you think you can be unafraid of others? No! It is precisely because you have great strength that people won't compete with you directly. They will simply squat down and pull your feet out, and you will fall without a doubt. This is because you haven't established your footing! This is "frontal pulling out."</p>
<p>At the same time, even if you have established your footing, do you think you can be worry-free? Who knows, the person pulling you won't pull you to your face. Instead, they will hide behind you, insert their hands between your feet, and pull backward with all their might. You will still inevitably fall. This is the function of "reverse pulling out." Even if you are highly skilled, it will be in vain!</p>
<p>Those who know the power of "pulling out" don't want to give up so easily. Even if you pull them down, they can still climb onto the stage. Thinking that this way, they can avoid the danger of being pulled. Little do they know, the person who wants to pull you out will dismantle your stage. In other words, they won't pull your feet, they will pull out the stage you're standing on. "Pulling out the stage" is the same as "pulling out the feet." Eventually, you will fall again. Then the person who pulled you out can climb onto the stage themselves. But if you want revenge, you can pull their feet out in the same way, remember?</p>
<h3 id="e253">A Brief Record of Whale Watching <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Yahun</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a sensation in this city about a large whale. Driven by curiosity, I also spent half a day's pay to go and see it. Haha! It's true that seeing is believing. This whale had probably been out of the water for a long time, so it had a stench. Its black skin was as smooth as if it had been oiled. Its entire body was not more than a hundred feet long, and its weight certainly did not exceed ten thousand pounds. It can be seen that the stories in Shanghai are often exaggerated. Compared to what I saw more than ten years ago in Zhenlongdian, Shaoxing, it was a world of difference. Now, I will introduce what I saw to those in this city who have seen the big whale:</p>
<p>A seagoing ship, loaded with salt bags, was leaving Zhenlongdian, heading for a certain port. When it reached the middle of the sea, it was already late, and in the haze, they saw a black mountain blocking their path. The captain of the ship was very careful and familiar with the harbor, so he was very surprised and suspicious. Upon closer inspection, he was extremely alarmed. Because this black mountain was slowly moving closer to the ship. This was not a sea monster, but certainly a fish monster. He immediately ordered to turn back the sails and try to return. Before a moment passed, although the ship was as fast as an arrow, the black mountain moved closer to the ship even faster. The people on the ship were all silent and worried, as they vigorously sailed. The black mountain moved closer and closer to the ship, and a mist-like drizzle splashed onto the stern. The captain knew that the situation was critical. He immediately took the salt bags from the hold and frantically threw them into the sea at the stern. Although the black mountain was still following, it sometimes rose and fell on the horizon. The captain knew that this was a sign of the big fish swallowing the salt bags. So, he kept throwing salt bags. As the ship's load lightened, it moved faster. As the sky was about to dawn, they returned to the original port. The tide had also passed, and they saw the black mountain, already silted up on the beach. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed a huge whale, its cries like the bellowing of a cow. Because a fish out of water has no power to exert, they hired workers to drag the fish closer to the shore for people to see. It immediately caused a sensation throughout the area. To see the end of its fins, one had to climb up a ladder. Placed on the coast for a long time, it had already developed a stench. Its meat was cut and butchered, but it was too stinky to eat. They boiled its oil for lamp fuel. It was said that someone took its belly out, and there were many gold and silver utensils inside, and its shoulder blades were said to resemble stone mortars.</p>

<p>— Yu Renmei</p>
<p>In this column, Mr. Zhao Ziming and the Fisherman of the East Sea have successively introduced Mr. Wang, his wife, and Miss Wang. What is missing is a Young Master Wang.</p>
<p>This Young Master Wang was extremely intelligent and eloquent from a young age. His apple-like face was set with lively eyes, and his lips were as red as if young girls had applied rouge. Therefore, Mr. Wang and his wife loved him as the apple of their eye.</p>
<p>However, although Young Master Wang was beautiful on the outside and intelligent on the inside, he simply did not like books. Mr. Wang fully intended to teach his son all the knowledge he had accumulated, so that he could "be promoted and make a fortune" and "bring glory to his family" in the future. But unexpectedly, when Young Master Wang opened a book, he kept saying "I'm dizzy." Not only did he dislike books so much, but he also called his father a "bookworm." When Mr. Wang saw him like this, he couldn't help but burst into thunderous anger. With a shout, he ordered his son to kneel in front of the ancestral hall, gritted his teeth, and began to whip him. But when Mrs. Wang saw the situation, she immediately jumped up in a rage, with tears in her eyes, scolding, "You old fool, we don't want him to take the imperial examination, why force him to read this damn thing? We are both old now, and all that's left is this bit of flesh and blood. If you force him to death, who will I rely on in the future!" Mr. Wang couldn't answer a word.</p>
<p>From then on, Young Master Wang became increasingly dissolute. All day long, he went with a group of hooligan youths to visit prostitutes, flirted with women, and from time to time, he became addicted to opium, his spirit becoming increasingly weakened, far from what it used to be.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wang and his wife saw their son so unsuccessful, they finally became depressed and unhappy and passed away one after another. It is said that when Mr. Wang and Mrs. Wang passed away, Young Master Wang was actually in a brothel, having fun with a group of prostitutes. Moreover, Young Master Wang didn't care about anything about the funeral arrangements, all of which were handled by relatives. At the same time, the family property was also seized completely. From then on, Young Master Wang gradually became short of money and had no way to borrow money. Finally, he became a beggar.</p>
<p>When Young Master Wang thought of the past, it was like a "Yellow Millet Dream."</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Who Can Be Without Feelings, Family Thoughts Are Ash; Morale of Soldiers, Not厭詐; Bold Words Strengthen Military Hearts</p>
<p>Our troops, upon reaching the defensive area, will immediately receive their pay, and during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, we can all have a good time. Once we start moving, we won't have to deduct food expenses. Whatever the pay is, that's what's left. Besides, as soldiers, if we only seek comfort, stationed somewhere, hoping not to move an inch for the rest of our lives, where will we find a chance to advance? Those who have reached the rank of battalion commander or higher, who hasn't endured a period of hardship? So this time, moving to Eastern Hebei is a good opportunity for us. It depends on each person's fortune. No one can say for sure who will have the chance to become an official and get rich. This is all talk that should only be said by those who have abandoned their military duties, but these soldiers took it as an absolute truth, and every one of them beamed with joy. They didn't seem as anxious as the company commanders, who were afraid of fighting foreign soldiers. Zhao Ziqiang saw that his own speech had gained some power, so he said to the soldiers: "This morning, everyone can write letters home. After this afternoon, I'm afraid there won't be any more opportunities." After speaking, he assigned several tasks to the platoon leaders and left. This was all well and good, but the company commander immediately became busy. Of his three platoon leaders, two had families. Both of them wanted to borrow a bag of flour from the company commander to support their families. The sergeant quartermaster, who was the closest to the company commander, also wanted to borrow a few dollars to pay his debts. Because the shopkeepers in several stores, hearing that the army was suddenly leaving, couldn't collect their debts and were crying. People's hearts are made of flesh, how could they completely ignore them? So they also came to discuss with the company commander, asking him to give them some money. Although the soldiers couldn't borrow whole dollars or whole bags of flour, they each had their own difficulties. The first was the company commander's order to write letters. Everyone could write a letter home. The stationery and envelopes were not a problem; they could be found at the company headquarters. But the five-cent stamp for regular mail, a full five cents in silver dollars, they didn't know where to find it. There was no way around it; they had to ask the company commander for help with this trivial matter. (223)</p>

<p>A Badge is a Half-Price Ticket? The train from Shanghai North Station to Qigu Yunmeng had just passed Zhenru when two ticket inspectors walked in, wearing black serge uniforms and peaked caps with gold emblems. It was just like what Mr. Cui Wanquiu described in his novel "New Road," where the Japanese called them conductors. Indeed, Chinese people can never be as hypocritically polite as the Japanese, saying, "Excuse me, may I see your ticket?" But compared to before, when they were always followed by three or four armed military police carrying box cannons, this feeling was much better. Across from me sat two officials from the capital's government offices (or perhaps officials, because I didn't ask, so I couldn't be sure). The ticket inspector took their tickets and looked at them, but they were half-price tickets. He said, "Please take out your badge and show me the symbol." One of the plump ones took out a round badge with blue and gold lettering from his pocket. The ticket inspector verified that it was correct, punched the ticket, and returned it to him. Another gentleman in a Western suit fumbled for a long time but couldn't find it. He said, "I forgot to bring it with me." The ticket inspector said, "That is the order from the department. Without a badge, no matter who it is, they must pay the full fare according to the regulations." That gentleman in the Western suit was also very polite and did not resist because they were not escorted by armed soldiers. He took out a five-yuan Central Bank note from his wallet and paid the difference. I didn't bother to ask the ticket inspector if this badge was only valid for military, political, or railway agencies in the capital. If anyone could pay half price with a government badge, then the railway department's revenue budget would seem to have to be slightly discounted.</p>
<p>▲ Slapping the Bed Frame and Calling for Happiness Jia Le went to the Boxue Hospital in Tianci Village to visit his sister-in-law, and he insisted that I accompany him. I agreed readily because I also wanted to go to my friend Xiao Qing's house. Who knew that when he entered the patient's room, he suddenly felt a surge of illusory fantasies, and the smell of medicine hit him, and his mind suddenly lost control of himself. At that time, because I didn't enter the ward, I was talking to my brother-in-law in the downstairs living room. He happened to poke his head out to look at me, and just as he turned the corner, a nurse walked out. In his eyes, he felt a flash of white, and his heart couldn't help but skip a beat. In his complicated confusion, he was actually frightened. He woke up jumping throughout the night. He and I have always been comrades who advocated breaking superstitions and did not believe in gods or ghosts. This time, however, he couldn't help but think of "slapping the bed frame and calling for happiness." I couldn't do it, so I specially asked my mother-in-law to do it. Sure enough, it was effective. After calling for happiness, he slept soundly until dawn. This is probably a psychological effect, right? I am not promoting superstition here because the fact is so strange! I wrote it down, treating it as a form of hypnosis or mental telepathy. Then this kind of hypnosis is indeed our national essence and not some trick invented in the West.</p>
<p>▲ Ode to Pig Oil Cake White sugar rose pig oil cake, and spiced tea eggs and dried tofu, are also part of the three-part food journey for travelers. However, pig oil cake is only available at Suzhou Station, and not at other stations or on the trains. Because it is a specialty of Suzhou Station, I paid special attention to it while waiting for the train. A middle-aged man with a long, thin face was squatting down, taking care of his business—pig oil cake. First, he arranged the unheated cake pieces in a circle on a basket lined with lead and buried with a stove underneath. Then, he gradually baked them in rows of five on the heated lead. A sweet aroma was enough to make hungry travelers salivate. After they were baked, he would push the old and bring forth the new, replacing them with a row of cold ones, just like training new soldiers. If customers were not enthusiastic, he would remove the fuel from under the pot, lifting the lead and using a pair of iron chopsticks to clamp out the burning charcoal in the stove. Or, because he didn't need a strong fire for the time being, he would clamp a small, round, perforated iron plate on the edge of the stove, covering it to flatten the heat for five minutes. But at this time, the ruthless wind from the wilderness blew, scattering the white ash from the stove and spreading it on top of the pig oil cake, as if adding a lot of pepper. Because the colors were indistinguishable, there was no noticeable situation for customers to see, so his pig oil cake business was still not bad. Suddenly, he frowned, lifted the basket to the edge of the platform, jumped into the wilderness of the tracks, pulled down his pants and relieved himself! At the same time, he turned his head and stared at the basket, to prevent unscrupulous people from stealing his cake. After a while, he jumped back onto the platform. Just then, a child came up with seven copper coins in his hand to buy a cake from him. He didn't wipe his hand that had just been relieving himself, stretched out five fingers, picked up a piece, and gave it to the child. The child happily stuffed it into his mouth and chewed. This is called "what the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve"!</p>

<h3 id="e257">Financial News: America to Raise Cash Prices, Gold Falls Sharply, Losing 21.4 Yuan; People's Hearts Are Unsettled, Many Liquidate Long Positions, Breaking Through 790 Yuan Wide Open <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>The gold market suddenly experienced a sharp drop yesterday, breaking through the two major levels of 800 yuan and 90 yuan. In the morning, although the overseas silver market showed declines in England and America, the forward silver price on the gold exchange actually rose by 0.97 points, coupled with a surge in exchange rates, catching dealers off guard. London spot gold fell by one shilling and one pence. The price of American new mined gold was 9.98 yuan, up 0.21 yuan from the previous day. American wheat was down 1.375 points, American cotton was up 21 points, and stocks were up 3.2 yuan. The opening price of the raw gold market immediately broke through the 800 yuan level and then rose to 804.5 yuan as commodities were raised. At this time, Reuters had not yet reported the exchange rates for the US and Britain. When the news of the US-British exchange rate rising by 0.1525 points and the US-French exchange rate rising by 0.2675 points arrived, the market plunged rapidly, falling by another ten yuan in an instant. After the opening, HSBC's listing showed a decline of 0.125 in the British exchange rate and an increase of 0.0625 in the US exchange rate. The market was stable but fatigued, fluctuating uncertainly. Later, news from Reuters that the US President would convene a meeting with the director of the US Reconstruction Silver Corporation and currency officials at the Treasury Department tomorrow morning at 9:00 to determine a government purchase price for newly mined gold, and that this price would be higher than the world's free gold market, so gold would no longer flow out, spread. People's hearts were unsettled, and many liquidated their long positions, breaking through the 790 yuan level. The market was able to recover slightly at noon. The market situation was severe in the first half of the day because the French cabinet had fallen, and exchange rates were expected to decline, but unexpectedly, they surged so much today. Reports said that although the American new monetary system increased the price of cash, the US dollar would inevitably depreciate, and the gold price could not withstand it. The highest speculative price was 1,110 yuan. The central government has transacted spot goods. Now I will record the market situation for the first half of the day.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 795 yuan, down 18.8 yuan from the previous close. The opening price of commodities was 4.8 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with the recent selling price of British exchange rate at one shilling and three pence and 25 points, and the US exchange rate at 30 yuan. The market rose slightly at the beginning of the session, and then rose to 6.7 yuan because Hengyu and Richang bought February US dollars at 5625. Hengyu and Richang then re-emerged and Hongxing, Hengxingyuan, Yuanmaoyong, Hongli, Daxingyong, etc. sold, retreating to 3.3 yuan. HSBC then bought February US dollars at 6875, and Hengxing and Ruikang bought, rising to 5.5 yuan. Before HSBC's listing revealed a decline of 0.125 in the British exchange rate and an increase of 0.0625 in the US exchange rate, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, and Daxingyong sold again, with Xiangmeng and Se February US dollars at 6875. Yuanfengyong also came forward and fell to 1.5 yuan. Zhaofengchang Hengyu and Ruikang took advantage of the low price to buy again and formed a recovery. Zhengjin bought January half yuan, and McGalli and Huabi also bought February US dollars at 6875. Xianghe bought and gradually rose to 4.8 yuan. Hanheng sold and fell, and Shunli and Wanxing also sold, falling again to 2.3 yuan. Huabi then bought January US dollars at 6875, but it was difficult to settle. Richang, Ruikang, and Hengyu bought in the market and rose to 5.1 yuan. The Dalian gang supplied in the market and showed a slight decline. The central bank packed January US dollars at 625 and retreated to within 4 yuan. Later, due to unfavorable news, Dafayong, Hongli, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Daxingyong, Dacheng, Hongxing, and Tianfengyong scrambled to sell, and fell to 89 yuan. McGalli bought January US dollars at 625, and the Dalian gang and Fuyu tried to buy, and the market recovered. Fuchang and Zhaofengchang also bought in, and the noon close rose to 792.4 yuan. Commodities were sold for 3.5 yuan. The market was relatively stable after the close due to purchases by Dingchang and the Dalian gang. The highest price in the first half of the day was 796.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 789 yuan, with a fluctuation of 7.7 yuan. As a result, it fell sharply by 21.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 9.875 yuan because HSBC's US exchange rate rose by 0.0625, and the combined gold price was 803 yuan.

<h3 id="e263">Securities: Unfounded Rumors Shake the Bond Market, Decline Ranges from 6-7 Jiao to 1.5 Yuan, Only One Round of Trading Due to Time Constraints in the Afternoon <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market was shaken by unfounded political rumors, and the financial community was still selling heavily. Various groups were mostly selling more than buying, with only a few financial institutions buying in. The Northern group, however, significantly increased their purchases. With only one day remaining before the end of the current month's settlement, the turmoil is bound to remain dangerous. Yesterday morning, trading opened with No. 21, starting from the demobilization bonds, being sold off one by one. Subsequently, No. 33 joined in, and then No. 20 from the 20th Customs, causing the decline to become more and more severe. Although No. 11 absorbed a large amount, it was a drop in the bucket, so each round fell by as much as 3-4 jiao to about 1.2 yuan. The second round of trading did not begin until 1 PM, initially continuing to fall by about half a yuan. After that, Nos. 4 and 41, starting from the 20th Customs, slightly rebounded, rising by 1-2 jiao to 0.35 yuan, but the trend of salt tax bonds remained weak, indicating the fragility of market sentiment. The afternoon session did not open until 4:45 PM, and due to the late hour, it was decided to only conduct one round of trading. Market prices remained sluggish, with large investors continuously selling, while Nos. 4, 11, and 41 continued to buy actively. Market prices fell another 2-3 jiao to 0.5-0.6 yuan. The overall trend for the day was a severe decline, and the future of the bond market is fraught with turmoil. In the end, prices fell across the board, ranging from 0.6-0.7 jiao to 1.4-1.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was 25,540,000 yuan, with no spot trading. Futures trading in unified tax bonds totaled 10,370,000 yuan, including 3,560,000 in demobilization bonds, 2,670,000 in 19th Customs charity bonds, 5,115,000 in 20th Customs bonds, 1,300,500 in gold short-term bonds, and the remaining amounts ranging from tens of thousands to 300,000-400,000. Today is the last day of October futures trading.</p>

<p>A New York trading house reported on the 24th that the New York stock market was generally weak throughout the day. However, in the last minute, buyers suddenly surged, and market conditions rebounded sharply. The reason for this is difficult to explain. Some say it was due to the weakness of the US dollar, while others say it was due to the revival of hopes for inflation. The total trading volume for the day was 2,110,000 shares. The wheat market showed hesitation due to the news that the government's need for wheat was temporarily met. In other respects, appetite was not strong, and prices fell again. The cotton market rebounded due to the revival of hopes for inflation under the new plan for commodity gold dollars, coupled with the decline in the US dollar exchange rate. The silver market was extremely firm, with expectations of a very high gold price tomorrow. The US Treasury Department's gold price was $29.80 per ounce. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market appeared very weak before the morning opening, as many overbought positions rushed to close, causing the market to decline. This month, prices had reached around 83 yuan, but after a certain association made efforts to buy, market prices gradually rebounded. About 7,000-8,000 bales were purchased, and continued buying in the afternoon helped to maintain market prices. However, actual demand transactions were mediocre.</p>

<p>The cotton market showed a slight weakness, but although foreign cotton rose, exchange rates rose, and market sentiment remained stable. The Cotton Inspection Bureau has released 35,000-36,000 bales of qualified goods, with tens of thousands of bales still under inspection. Therefore, the market has slightly relaxed, and spot cotton business remains sluggish, making the distant month market relatively calm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices rose due to active buying, strong support from Wall Street, and public buying. The market was firm and active.

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices were generally flat and then stable across all months. Chicago and Canada had small declines of 0.03-0.05 jiao. After opening, prices for all months fell by about 0.015 jiao, but factories continued to maintain their positions. Outside buyers and market speculators continued to buy, causing near and distant months to become firm again. When the afternoon market opened, the current month initially rose to 0.135 jiao, but then turned flat as speculators sold back. Distant months, however, saw further buying from outside speculators, and market speculators also gradually absorbed positions, causing previously weary market sentiment to become extremely elevated. In this situation, as long as there is no activity in spot foreign wheat, this momentum should be able to be maintained for the time being. As a result, the current month was 0.025 jiao lower, November was 0.0125 jiao higher, December was 0.0075 jiao higher, January was 0.01 jiao higher, and February and March were both 0.02 jiao higher.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, prices initially fell and then rose across all months. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago and Canada fell by 0.03-0.05 jiao, so prices for near and distant months initially fell by 0.03-0.04 jiao. However, as flour futures fell and then strengthened, market sentiment also improved. When the afternoon market opened, trading was smooth for near-term months, but there were few transactions for distant months. Considering the situation in the current month, it may have to be temporarily suspended because the standard has been raised too high, and it will be difficult to receive goods. As a result, the current month was 0.01 jiao higher, November was 0.02 jiao lower, December was unchanged, January was 0.02 jiao lower, and February was unchanged. The spot wheat market was generally stable, with smooth transactions. Kaiyangzhou wheat was 3.7 yuan, Liuhe wheat was 3.65 yuan, Bianjiang wheat was 3.51 yuan, and Hankou wheat was 3.37 yuan, down to 3.3 yuan. Fufeng bought 4,000 bags, and Xinda bought 1,200 bags.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's supply was even more abundant than before, with nearly 60 boats from various groups, totaling over 7,000 people. New Jian accounted for the majority, with broken Japonica and new Japonica each accounting for half. Therefore, although the market seemed to have bottomed out, fortunately, this street had over 3,000 shi of Japonica Jian sold, and the sellers tightened their positions, unwilling to lower prices further. Therefore, prices for Changbang, Sutongbang new Japonica, and Duyang Jian were not significantly different. However, only 500-600 packages of Qingjiao and other kiln-fired Baige packages were handled, causing prices to gradually decline. The market situation for various grades of thick rice varied depending on the intentions of out-of-town customers, resulting in inconsistent prices. Broken Japonica remained downstream, while new Yin Yuan shipments were slightly sluggish, and the market appeared weak.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 41-42 shipments arrived from various routes downstream. Sales of various types were normal. Market prices for broken Japonica, new Japonica, and Yangdu Jian were slightly lower by about 0.1 jiao, while Baiyuan prices were slightly lower by 0.2 jiao. Kiln-fired Baiguo white rice and aged thin rice were flat and weak. Port Jian saw price increases of nearly 1 foot, while Yin Yuan Kejian prices did not fluctuate much.</p>

<p>The Ke Xian rice market was in a bad situation, with market sentiment declining. Since the Fuzhou group stopped buying, the market has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Yesterday morning, local merchants were all watching and not buying, and sellers were trying to sell off their holdings. Currently, late rice is entering the market in various places, and Jiangxi's early and late milled rice is also being shipped. There will be a need for successive shipments after this, making the market even more sluggish, with prices falling by 0.1 jiao. Because of the price drop, local merchants began to inquire, and although the Fuzhou group handled over 200 bags in the market, they were returning some of the rice they had previously purchased, with fewer purchases than sales. The market was difficult to improve, and there were rumors that the group had ordered the purchase of small twisted rice for return. Therefore, although trading was active throughout the day, prices were difficult to rebound. Throughout the day, this street sold 100 bags of small twisted rice at 7.35 yuan, 200 bags of Jiangxi old late rice at 7.06-6.79 yuan, over 100 bags of Nanjing Xian at 6.7 yuan, down to 6.2 yuan, 211 bags of milled early rice and 200 bags of rough early rice from Quanzhou at 5.65 yuan, 300 bags of milled Jing at 7.1 yuan, 150 bags of Jiangbei Xian at 6.8 yuan, 276 bags of Wuxi Xian at 7 yuan, and Fuzhou bought 102 bags of Anqing rice at 6.6 yuan. Ningbo also bought over 100 bags of milled late rice.</p>

<p>Under pressure, peanut sellers were in financial straits because new goods are difficult to store for long, and subsequent batches of arrivals continue, so they had to lower prices to attract demand. Yesterday's market price was a staggering two yuan lower than the previous official market price, triggering purchases from Guangdong. However, the initial trading was not strong, with about 300 bags of Shandong goods transacted at 7 yuan. This street bought over 200 bags of Shandong goods, also at 7 yuan, 200 bags of Qingdao goods at 7.8 yuan, and 300 bags of Yantai goods at 8.2 yuan. 200 bags of Yantai peanuts were also sold at 6.5 yuan.</p>

<p>▲ New York Silk Prices Rise Continuously, Local American Silk Merchants, such as Lan Lebi &amp; Co., received a telegram from New York yesterday morning, stating that since President Luo took measures to increase prices, the US exchange rate has stabilized, and the silk market has seen a surge in buying from hoarders, causing silk prices to rise sharply. The standard silk price has risen by over 0.1 US dollars per pound in three days, equivalent to a 40 yuan increase per dan in Chinese currency. Market sentiment has been boosted as a result.</p>
<p>▲ Rayon Sales Remain Sparse, With a Weak Foreign Exchange Rate and Firm Rayon Prices, only 15 boxes of No. 1 and No. 2 Hongyu and Lan Ning brands were shipped yesterday by local silk factories, with prices ranging from 179.5 yuan to 156.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>▲ American Firms Take the Opportunity to Purchase Factory Silk, The New York raw silk market has seen rising silk prices due to the American government's efforts to raise prices. Shanghai American firms have taken the opportunity to purchase factory silk, but manufacturers are reluctant to hold onto their large inventory, causing the B-grade white factory silk to be purchased by Lan Lebi and others at a stable price of 80 bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign tea market saw a decline in transactions. English firms, such as Jinlong, Xiehe, and major foreign firms, have exhausted their inventories of tea from Tunxi, Wudong, and other areas that are sold together, and are preparing to close down. In addition to packing and shipping teas purchased in previous months, they have no intention of buying any green tea for the time being. Yesterday, only Tongfu, Duder, and Yingfa and other firms bought 197 boxes of Zhenmei, Zhenmei, and Xiamu teas, with Zhenmei priced at 178 yuan at the top, Xiamu at 62 yuan, and Zhenmei at 40 yuan, all unchanged from before.</p>

<p>Although there are fewer Wuye branches produced in Zhangzhou this year, the price is still relatively cheap. Due to disagreements over land prices, there has been a shortage of supply for a long time. It is now heard that a new batch will arrive soon, and it is planned to increase the price by 1-2 yuan based on the previous price. The higher-quality goods are priced at 22 yuan, and are currently being quoted. It is estimated that a decision will be made after the samples are seen.</p>

<p>▲ Articles Require Skillful Management to Achieve Success</p>
<p>In this year of national goods promotion, the market is sluggish. People generally feel that their purchasing power is weak. Coupled with the relentless promotion of foreign goods, doing business is as difficult as climbing to the heavens. We, who are engaged in the national goods industry, must, in addition to studying the refinement of products and reducing costs, naturally study business acumen to make sense. Moreover, doing business must not be a rigid process. For example, in the past, the enemies of national goods were generally said to be only imported goods. However, after increasing import taxes, implementing place-of-origin labeling regulations, and implementing anti-dumping taxes, there are two new enemies: foreign goods that evade taxes and factories established by foreigners in China. We should prepare early.</p>
<p>The autumn wind is strengthening, and the mooncake era has passed. Boss Xian is also busy. We occasionally talk with Xian about business acumen and unexpectedly get a fascinating lesson from Xian, which is well worth introducing.</p>
<p>Xian said: Doing mooncake business for the Mid-Autumn Festival is like writing a great article. Celebrities can hire ghostwriters to write articles, but I have to use my own heart and pen. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, I first have to draft a basic plan in my mind. How to arrange, how to describe, how to contrast, and how to structure, all require careful design and research before I can write a good and outstanding article. Doing mooncake business is really not easy: If you make too much, you can't sell it, and the store regrets it. If you make too little, people can't buy it, and they curse you to death. To be perfectly balanced, it depends on our ability to write articles. During these few days of the Mid-Autumn Festival, we are really at the crucial moment of writing articles, and we don't relax at all. Every day, I have five people guarding my command post, paying attention at all times and being careful every step of the way. One is in charge of advertising, one is in charge of external investigation, one is in charge of store investigation, one is in charge of factory manufacturing, and one is in charge of statistical research. For example, if the external investigator comes back and reports that lotus seed paste is the best-selling mooncake in all stores this year, then the store will prepare more lotus seed paste mooncakes. The factory will rush to produce them. The statistician will immediately report the findings separately and ask all departments to pay attention. The advertiser will also change methods and be original. As for me, I will respond in the middle, pointing left and right. On the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I calculate the output, and it is just right, neither too much nor too little. This article is well submitted, and everyone's heart will be relieved. Do you think it's clever? It turns out that doing business should be like this, especially doing a one-time business. In general, most businesses are one-time, trendy clothing is one-time, modern clothing is one-time, any kind of commodity, when it first comes out, is one-time, but you must not be careless, only thinking about making money to ruin your own business and reduce the buyer's trust. In the end, you still suffer yourself. Tell me, how much good is there?</p>
<p>I think Xian's words have research and adoption value for national goods leaders in order to promote their careers.</p>

<h3 id="e283">Controlled Production and Developing National Goods <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Following the wild waves of the global economic panic, the rising tide of "controlled economy" is also surging before us. Currently, the chorus praising it reaches the clouds, and it can be said that it has become a unanimous opinion across the country. However, we must understand that the origin of this new term is not an empty theory but a real entity built on society. Its most important part is "controlled production," with the aim of advancing the national goods production industry through the most rationalized planning and control, ensuring the simultaneous increase of production and consumption, equal distribution, improved production methods and national living standards, and striving to prevent the import of foreign goods, so as to lead the national economy to the safest and most consolidated path.</p>
<p>Therefore, "controlled economy," in a narrow sense, can perhaps also be called "controlled production." Its most important purpose is nothing more than to seek government assistance and industry coordination for the national goods production industry, to develop the entire industry through the most rationalized planning and implementation, and at the same time, to strive to eliminate its business contradictions and conflicts, and to achieve a balance in all aspects of production and sales. From the previous unplanned production, it moves into the stage of planned "controlled production." In this reality and process, we can use the previous situation as a mirror for the present.</p>
<p>In recent years, the national goods production industry, although it has been vigorous and has made considerable progress and achievements, has always been due to the privatization of our country's commercial system. Most of them adopt "free economy" to seek the development of individual enterprises. Although there are occasionally joint business organizations, they can never maintain their normal state, and eventually disintegrate and fall apart, each seeking its own interests. Thus, industries engage in infighting and price-cutting competition, presenting a bad situation in society. In our country's industry, which is still in its infancy and backward in production, can it withstand the onslaught of storms and think of changing it?</p>
<p>We must deeply understand that our country is a country with backward production. The ratio of production volume to consumption volume is only two to five. Therefore, at present, the advancement of the national goods industry and the people's need for industrial products are absolutely proportional. However, in the past, due to our lack of planning and distribution, all industries were crowded into one corner and competed, and failed. What we urgently need in the future is how to balance supply and demand, adapt production and sales, and solve the problem of regional distribution. How to give accurate regulations based on its historical and geographical relationship, and popularize it throughout the vast and populous country, so that national goods factories will have no panic of overproduction, and the people will have no shame of replacing national goods with foreign goods due to the lack of national goods. Everything that should be promoted and reformed can be hoped for in the success of "controlled production."</p>
<h3 id="e284">National Crisis and National Goods <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Liwen</p>
<p>This year is a year of national crisis, and also a year of national goods, as some people have already discussed in newspapers. What I want to say here is the connected relationship between national crisis and national goods:</p>
<p>National goods companies are posting large advertisements saying: "With such a national crisis, Chinese people should use Chinese goods!" The general bourgeois ladies and young ladies do not know there is a national crisis at all: and they all have a mindset that it is embarrassing to wear Chinese goods. Therefore, although the company's advertisements are posted so large, they do not even glance at them.</p>
<p>As for those poor people, due to the national crisis, the social depression, and the economic decline, it is very difficult for them not to feel hungry all day long. When their clothes are old and torn, they can only make do with them. Even if national goods cloth is cheap enough to buy a bolt for a penny, they cannot afford it!</p>
<p>In this way, national goods are unsalable due to the national crisis!</p>
<p>But, strangely, in this time of national crisis, when Chinese goods are so unsalable, foreign goods have unexpectedly become very popular and sold especially well. This is not a lie, and there is no need to talk about the past. This month's newspapers, as long as you are willing to flip through them, you will definitely find many examples of foreign goods being dumped. Alas! The national crisis has caused the unsalability of national goods, but it has also increased the sales of foreign goods. I really don't know what is in the hearts of the Chinese people?</p>
<p>If this continues, if the national crisis in China increases in the future, the market will be full of foreign goods, and national goods stores will have to close down!</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e285">Several Preconditions for Preventing the Import of Foreign Goods <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Indeed, it goes without saying that the result of foreign goods dumping will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in import surplus and the decline of national production, the outflow of money and the decline of industry and commerce. If it is a spreading trend, then, what the wild waves reach, in the fastest period, will immediately reveal the bankruptcy of finance and the exhaustion of finance. Its dangerousness is enough to put the national economy to death.</p>
<p>However, the past facts are that the market state of our country in recent years has responded to the above-mentioned phenomenon, and has entered this most serious stage. It can be said that every imperialist who has entered the hall and entered the room is thinking of using economic "magic medicine" to invade, seeking market monopoly, scheming against each other, making themselves the cleaver and us the fish and meat. The arrival of foreign goods is like mercury spilling on the ground, penetrating everywhere, until it reaches remote rural areas, without leaving anything behind. As a result, the import surplus has revealed an unprecedented huge number, which is something that makes us very heartbroken.</p>
<p>Although promoting national goods and revitalizing industry and commerce has become the mantra of the whole country, speaking with one voice and with consistent calls, and considerable achievements have indeed been made in its past efforts and future arrangements, which is deeply gratifying, we still don't understand that the customs estimates for the import of foreign goods are always higher day by day, and the huge numbers are enough to make us tremble with fear. In my humble opinion, there are probably the following three reasons, and we have to bring them up for discussion in order to remove obstacles:</p>
<p>1. Tariff Issues: In the current autumn of fierce commercial warfare, all countries in the world have strict barriers, and there is no way to enter. However, our country, due to the fact that it could not control its tariffs in the past, allowed invasion. Even now, the tax revenue is very low, and there is no anti-dumping tax.</p>
<p>2. Preferential Treatment for Foreign Businesses in China: Foreign businesses set up factories in the mainland, using their abundant capital, complete equipment, and taking advantage of our country's low wages and exemption from donations and taxes. Their products naturally affect our industry, which is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>3. Shipping Issues: Our country allows all countries to freely navigate inland waterways, which is also enough to serve as a medium for increasing the import of foreign goods. Just look at the recent vigorous development of the business of various Japanese ships in the midst of the anti-Japanese goods movement, and you will see a good example.</p>
<p>Here, we deeply understand that as long as we strive to improve the production of national goods and the fundamental awakening of the public to refuse to use foreign goods, then the advancement of the national goods industry will always be thriving. However, we cannot ignore everything else too much. The above three points are what we consider to be the most important preconditions at present. If they are not adequately resolved in the shortest possible time, then I am afraid that the general public, especially the general national goods manufacturers, will be like looking at the clouds in a severe drought, and hoping for its early success. The problem of "preventing the import of foreign goods" will never have a thorough solution and realization.</p>
<p>Women and National Goods</p>
<h3 id="e286">How Women Can Promote National Goods <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xieli</p>
<p>In 1929, the total amount of Japanese goods imported into China was 306,930,000 Customs Taels. I have carefully analyzed it, and roughly speaking, non-productive goods (consumer goods) accounted for 70% of the total, and the goods that women often buy accounted for more than 43% of the total non-productive goods. Although it is uncertain whether a small part of this 43% is jointly purchased by men and women, the number actually exceeds more than half of the non-productive goods, which is really amazing. The high number of foreign goods used by women is evident from this.</p>
<p>Why do women buy so many foreign goods? There are probably no more than the following two reasons: (1) Young women are vain and fashionable! Loving beauty is originally the nature of young women, but their "vanity" is too great and their "fashion desire" is too strong. They worship extravagance, admire modernity, and compete to use foreign goods for all clothing and decorations to show off: the higher the value, the more it seems to show their wealth. Thus, daughters of wealthy families compete for novelty and beauty, and promote it from above; while daughters of ordinary families also admire its beauty, follow suit, and try their best to imitate it, almost considering that non-imported goods are not fashionable, and not using foreign goods is not enough to be considered modern. Even if the country can be destroyed and the family can be broken, not being fashionable and modern is not allowed! This is the first reason. (2) Older women lack patriotism and discernment: Because education is relatively unpopular and the education system is poor in our country, women have a very weak concept of the country, especially older women. Moreover, they do not often go out except to buy things, and do not pay much attention to the types of foreign goods. When buying, they only choose cheap, clever, and beautiful things, so they are most easily exploited by unscrupulous merchants, and often buy foreign goods without even knowing it. This is the second reason for buying more foreign goods.</p>
<p>Judging from the above two reasons, women's purchase of more foreign goods is not without reason. If we want to promote national goods, women's responsibility is really great.</p>
<p>Moreover, the so-called national goods naturally include clothing, food, and use. According to Chinese customs, men manage outside affairs and women manage internal affairs. The clothing materials, socks, children's clothing, food, and all daily necessities used in the family are mostly purchased by women. If women can really promote national goods, its effect will be above that of men.</p>
<p>Then how can women promote national goods? Roughly speaking, it can be divided into three categories: (1) Promote thrift: Excessive consumption and waste, and excessive trends towards luxury, are contrary to the path of life. For example, clothing, which originally only seeks cleanliness and comfort, does not need to be very beautiful and luxurious. National goods are already available, and women may as well take thrift as a virtue and strive to promote national goods: on the one hand, it can reduce the family burden, and on the other hand, it can serve the country! (2) Change concepts: "Fashion" and "modern" originally have no fixed standards, but are just a trend of the times. Looking back decades ago, women all considered small feet to be fashionable. Once this trend is reformed, if women still bind their feet, it will become a joke. Therefore, if women in the knowledge community can take the lead, purchase and use national goods, change their vision, and regard using national goods as fashionable, it may not be impossible to change customs and habits. (3) Pay attention to identification: Women can carefully check their daily necessities, and ask people who understand what they cannot identify. See how many foreign goods you have used, so that you can be vigilant in the future. Or combine with several families to collect foreign goods and use them as specimens for public viewing, reducing the opportunity for the public to be fooled.</p>
<p>Some people say: Unscrupulous merchants, in order to cater to the purchasing desires of many women, disregard the survival and interests of the country and purchase foreign goods. I think this is not an exaggeration: because from the principles of economics, the needs of the buyers are the main conditions that determine the market and the quantity of production. If women, who are in the dominant position of consumers and buyers, can reduce or eliminate the need for foreign goods, then unscrupulous merchants will definitely lament their miscalculation.</p>
<p>Now, there are indeed many women participating in social activities and making practical efforts for the country. In this matter, I think they can certainly show their strength even more!</p>
<h3 id="e287">Come! Let's All Arm Ourselves with National Cloth! <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Nanguo Jiaren</p>
<p>What do you think of thin clothes in late autumn? The national territory has been lost for a long time; How can we sleep on firewood and taste gall? May everyone arm themselves with national cloth!</p>
<p>Recently, a friend of mine came back from overseas. He came in from the South Gate (Hong Kong, Guangzhou), passed through the Southeast Gate (Shantou, Xiamen), then entered the East Gate (Shanghai), and entered the newly built main hall (the capital). He was very happy looking here and looking there. Because I had been separated from him for a long time and we had reunited, I opened my mouth and asked him: "You have been abroad for several years. Come back and take a look at your old home. The entire field in the Northeast has been offered to the domineering eastern neighbor as unmortgaged land. Seeing the east-wearing and west-wearing in the country, do you feel that the country will perish without a day?"</p>
<p>That friend gave me a blunt answer: "I think China will not perish, but the nation has the atmosphere of rejuvenation. To prove this, there are more modern men and women wearing suits and student uniforms than before. Comrades in long gowns who bow respectfully seem to be gradually decreasing compared to before."</p>
<p>I smiled in disappointment and said: "You are wrong! The comrades wearing short clothes, especially suits, consume almost all foreign goods. These treasures are adding capital to foreign factories and increasing the naval, land, and air force power of imperialism to oppress our weak nation. Where is the atmosphere of national prosperity? It is simply the vanguard of national destruction."</p>
<p>That friend, without waiting for me to finish speaking, gritted his teeth and explained: "Short clothes are the clothing of the working class. No matter what, they are always more convenient than long gowns and robes similar to cassocks. If we want national rejuvenation, we must invigorate every citizen; then we must learn from King Zhao Wuling and wear foreign clothes instead of long gowns. Now the national cloth products are thriving. As long as everyone uses national goods to make short clothes, then can't both form and spirit be improved?"</p>
<p>"Among the young people in suits I have seen everywhere, in addition to a few university professors, rich fashionable young men, and administrative personnel wearing foreign suits on lantern frames, many more practical young people are happy to use national cloth to make short clothes. As for the uniforms of students in various schools, that goes without saying."</p>
<p>"As for the qipao materials of modern women, most of them love to use national products. Women who imitate suits can even be said to be a manifestation of 'when the country is about to prosper, there must be auspicious omens'. I have seen many foreign women, whether old or young, ugly or beautiful, almost all like to buy Chinese silk fabrics and embroidered products as fashionable clothes. Foreign men's clothes pay attention to 'stiffness', while women's clothes pay attention to 'lightness'. There are many national goods stores abroad that make money by relying on foreign modern women. If the new era women in China all learn from Western beauties and compete to use national silk and cotton fabrics to make modern clothes, wouldn't they be directly consuming the surplus money of their husbands or parents, and indirectly promoting national goods there?"</p>
<p>"In short, the national cloth arming movement is more practical and effective than all slogans and all declarations of important people!"</p>
<p>Hearing what he said made sense, I and my "Prime Minister" and "Little Adou" armed ourselves with national cloth together.</p>
<p>Rural Areas and National Goods</p>
<h3 id="e288">The Countryside and the National Goods Movement <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>▲Everyone Go to the Countryside to Promote National Goods</p>
<p>In this year of national goods, the slogan of promoting national goods has almost been shouted all over China. However, we feel that the amount of publicity seems to be very different between cities and the countryside. In general, those who bear the mission of promoting national goods are mostly engaged in the national goods movement in cities, but they have abandoned the mission of going to the countryside to publicize it. They do not take it upon their shoulders.</p>
<p>We feel that the hearts of the people in the city have already died. In China, no matter which city it is, the more lively it is, the more foreign goods are flooding it. If you don't believe it, look at the city of Greater Shanghai, the so-called Paris of the Far East. The number of young men in suits, young women in fancy clothes, cars coming and going, and locomotives speeding is undoubtedly more than in all the cities in China.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major base for exclusive sales of foreign goods. If Shanghai is destroyed, China's imports will be reduced by at least more than half. Foreign goods and civilization have become directly proportional to each other. In the eyes of people in the city, not wearing a suit or riding in a car seems to be unworthy of being called a civilized person. In this city filled with foreign air, those who promote national goods are just publicizing every day, and those who buy foreign goods are just going to buy foreign goods. And the effect of the publicity, although not completely lost, is also minimal.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that rather than promoting the national goods movement in the city, it is better to first go to the countryside to publicize it. Although in the countryside, due to different environments and different positions, whether foreign goods have invaded and how foreign goods are consumed, we cannot treat every village the same. But no matter what, the consumption of foreign goods in the countryside is definitely not as large as that in the city, which is an undeniable problem.</p>
<p>Moreover, in fact, like the villages that are closer to the city, they have been somewhat urbanized under the influence of the environment. Therefore, the invasion of foreign goods has also occupied a part of the power. But the older farmers may not have the need to use foreign goods for clothing, food, and housing. As for the villages that are farther away from the city and where transportation is inconvenient, foreign goods are extinct.</p>
<p>As long as we walk into a rural village, we will see the elders in the village. They wear felt hats on their heads, old cloth clothes on their bodies, cloth socks, and cloth-soled shoes. Everything on their bodies is national goods. The houses they live in are also built by Chinese craftsmen, not foreign houses. The utensils in the house are also mostly national goods. The white rice and fish and meat they eat are even more local products. Therefore, I think these people are the practitioners of promoting national goods. Everything we see in the countryside is completely different from that in the city, without any foreign air.</p>
<p>However, to say it again, the clothes, food, and housing needed by the general elders in the countryside are all national goods. However, recently, the younger farmers, because they have been influenced by the big cities and small cities, also have a tendency to like foreign goods. Copper basin hats, silk stockings, leather-soled shoes, and some wider serge and Gabardine robes, also have a few daily necessities, and they are also intent on luxury and buying foreign goods. Therefore, the power of foreign goods in the countryside is also expanding with the wheel of time.</p>
<p>China is a country based on agriculture. Among the 400 million compatriots, farmers account for the majority. Therefore, the area occupied by rural areas is also wider than the area occupied by cities. Now, foreign goods are still in the initial invasion of the countryside. If the power of foreign goods in the countryside expands in the future, so that the rural areas in China are invaded by foreign goods, then we believe that the number of foreign goods imported each year will be hundreds of times more than today. The future is an extremely dangerous thing.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, while the power of foreign goods in the countryside has not yet been deeply rooted, we can just go to the countryside to vigorously publicize and promote national goods, so that the general farmers know that buying foreign goods is a suicidal policy and is very dangerous. Explain the various interests and harms, so that all farmers do not use foreign goods. Because there are relatively few people in the countryside who use foreign goods, it is easier to publicize and promote national goods. The effect must be greater than in the city. Therefore, I think that to promote national goods and resist foreign goods, we should first publicize in the countryside.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Enamel Utensils and the Countryside <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>Enamel products are a kind of durable goods. Their categories, such as washbasins, food baskets, and rice bowls and teacups, are especially necessary for daily life. According to the principles of social economy, it is in line with the economic principles for people to prepare necessary supplies. Now, if there are durable necessary supplies to choose from, then their contribution to the social economy of a country is even greater. This is not only a matter of promoting national goods.</p>
<p>Now, we advocate the use of national goods and loudly proclaim the slogan of national goods penetrating into the countryside. Unfortunately, in recent years, the rural economy has declined and the purchasing power of farmers is extremely weak. This is a national problem as a whole, and there is a real need for active relief. However, whether national goods should be sold to the countryside at this time, and whether the countryside needs national goods, are preconditions that those who are responsible for promoting national goods should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Today's proponents of saving the country all advocate a frugal movement. The frugality of Chinese farmers can be said to be the best in the world. Not to mention the distant past, but the farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang still mostly wear coarse cloth clothes and burn vegetable oil lamps. Some even still use stone to make fire. Even the rural farmers in the Pudong area still mostly use wooden basins to wash their faces. Other things can be known from this. The object of promoting national goods is to refuse to use foreign goods. Today, farmers do not have much need for foreign goods. Although it is because of the lack of purchasing power, they do not need much anyway. Now, if we want national goods to penetrate into the countryside, we should also make a choice. If we are not careful, we will go from promoting national goods to promoting luxury. This is also a major research problem. Then, what kind of national goods should be deeply rooted in the countryside today? It is none other than enamel products.</p>
<p>I am not just advertising for enamel factories. Enamel is a durable product, and most of its products are needed by farmers. The same washbasin, if you buy a wooden one, you can't get it for less than four or five dimes. If you change to a small enamel basin, two or three dimes are enough. And it is light, clean, and beneficial to hygiene. It is not worth saving a dime to buy an enamel rice bowl. I have seen farmers using clumsy porcelain bowls, which are only worth a hundred or so coins each, but once they are dropped, they are useless. Enamel rice bowls will not break even if they are dropped a hundred times. No matter how they are used, they can be used for three years. As for using porcelain ones, at least ten or twenty or thirty of them will be used in three years. The ratio of one to twenty is complete. This is the fact, not a clever exaggeration. For other things, such as drying powder, there are enamel round and square plates. For storing seeds, there are enamel large and small pots. They cannot be invaded by moisture, and insects and mice cannot harm them. Ask about the price, and it is lower than bamboo and wooden utensils. Almost all kinds of enamel utensils meet the needs of rural utensils. As for the enamel warehouse basket, it is especially a wonderful product for delivering meals on the fields when farmers are busy with farming. Bean soup and vegetable soup are displayed separately. Sitting around and starting to eat, the heat is still there. It is not only its joy that is also. Therefore, in the future, the countryside will become more economical and frugal because of the use of enamel utensils. Enamel utensils will become more developed and cheaper because they penetrate into the countryside. I can't help but shout loudly: Long live the countryside! Long live enamel utensils!</p>
<p>Observation Notes</p>
<h3 id="e290">A Visit to the Zhanghua Woolen Textile Factory <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yiheng, Chen Shuying</p>
<p>▲Motivation for the Visit　Our country's woolen fabric market has long been monopolized by foreign merchants. It is estimated that the annual outflow of money is always more than 30 million [dollars]. Fortunately, recently, Mr. Liu Hongsheng, a Chinese national, established the Zhanghua Woolen Textile Factory, which emerged as a dark horse. The fabrics it produces are almost superior to imported goods in terms of quality, and the prices are low, which has led to a rapid rise in its reputation. Its various products sell quickly without needing to be promoted. It is expected that in a few years, it will be able to keep foreign goods out of the country. We have long heard of the name of Zhanghua and are eager to see its internal workings to understand the general situation of our country's emerging industries. However, because we lacked a familiar introduction and sufficient time, our long-cherished wish was difficult to fulfill, which was a pity.</p>
<p>▲Invitation from the Assistant Manager　After the start of the summer vacation, Mr. Xu Peixing of our school received a letter of invitation from Mr. Wu Bokuan, the assistant manager of the factory, asking us to visit. A group of 23 of us boarded the factory's private launch at the New Customs Wharf at 9:00 AM on September 17th to begin our trip. During this visit, we were treated with great hospitality and given detailed explanations of the factory's operations, allowing us to tour the entire factory within two hours. From raw materials to finished products, we collected a sample of each to use as educational material for production. We benefited greatly, thanks to Mr. Wu. Now, we will record what we learned during the visit, regarding the textile process of various woolen fabrics, as follows, which we believe will also be of interest to people in the country.</p>
<p>▲Textile Raw Materials　The raw materials used by the factory are described below in terms of their types, sources, uses, and quantities used:</p>
<p>A. Types</p>
<p>(1) Wool (sheep)</p>
<p>(2) Camel hair</p>
<p>(3) Cotton yarn (for camel down)</p>
<p>B. Sources (Wool)</p>
<p>(1) Domestic: Gansu, Xining, Hunan, Huzhou, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Tibet</p>
<p>(2) Foreign: Australia</p>
<p>C. Uses</p>
<p>(1) High-grade woolen fabrics (overcoat cloth, riding breeches cloth, straight twill cloth, gabardine) are woven from camel hair or Shandong wool mixed with Australian wool.</p>
<p>(2) Medium-grade woolen fabrics (uniform cloth, coarse serge, etc.) are woven from Huzhou wool mixed with Shandong wool.</p>
<p>(3) Low-grade woolen fabrics (military uniform cloth, camel down, etc.) are woven with cotton yarn as the warp and Huzhou wool as the weft.</p>
<p>D. Quantities Used</p>
<p>(1) Huzhou wool is used the most.</p>
<p>(2) Shandong wool is second.</p>
<p>(3) Camel hair is third.</p>
<p>(4) Cotton yarn is only used for the back of camel down.</p>
<p>(5) Not much wool from other regions and Australian wool are currently used, but the factory plans to increase the production of high-grade woolen fabrics in the future, at which time the quantity used will increase sharply.</p>
<p>▲Machinery　Most of the machinery in the factory was transferred from the old Hui Weaving Factory, and most of it is made in Belgium. The newly purchased machinery is from England and France. Except for the work of sorting wool, mending, and measuring, which all rely entirely on manual labor, all other work is done entirely by machinery. In total, there are no less than 20 types of machinery in the factory, totaling over 100 machines. Broadly speaking, there are steam engines, electric motors, wool washing machines, wool drying machines, wool blending machines, wool carding machines, wool combing machines, dyeing machines, spinning machines, yarn winding machines, weaving machines, and raising machines.</p>
<p>▲Work Conditions</p>
<p>(1) Spinning</p>
<p>1.  Sorting Wool　Sorting wool is the exclusive domain of female workers. The work relies entirely on individual experience. Each woman has a bamboo sieve in front of her and several bamboo baskets beside her. The best wool is put into the first basket. The next best is divided into the second, third, and fourth baskets. The unusable wool is called "foot wool," which is used to make coarse wool blankets and carpets.</p>
<p>2.  Washing Wool　After the wool is sorted, it is placed in a wool washing machine for cleaning. There are five machines in total. In each wool washing machine tank, water is mixed with an appropriate amount of soap and acid, and then heated to the specified temperature to completely remove the plant matter and dirt (such as grass leaves, dust, etc.) attached to the wool, without damaging the essence of the wool fiber. After five washes, the wool is free of impurities.</p>
<p>3.  The wool drying machine is steam-powered and has a very high temperature. The machine body is a flat, rectangular iron box divided into four compartments. After the top compartment is dried, it automatically tilts into the second compartment, then into the third and fourth compartments, and finally automatically tilts out of the box. This cycle continues endlessly. In addition, there is a drying stove and a drying cabinet. The daily output can supply the entire factory. After the wool is dried, if it is to be used for spinning and weaving natural-colored woolen serge, it is sent for carding or taken out for bleaching. Otherwise, it must go through the dyeing process.</p>
<p>4.  Dyeing　The factory uses only high-quality dyes for dyeing. After these dyes are mixed with water and heated, they can be completely absorbed by the wool to be dyed, leaving only a tank of clear water. These dyes are expensive, but the dyed material will never fade. The dyeing tanks are used exclusively for dyeing wool and camel hair. The other square wooden tanks are used for dyeing wool yarn, wool thread, and other items. There are also constantly rotating machines used to dye woven pieces of cloth. Mr. Wu told us, "Before dyeing any wool or woolen fabrics, we must first weigh them carefully and then mix them with the appropriate amount of dye. If the proportions are not correct, the resulting color will not be as satisfactory as expected."</p>
<p>5.  Blending Wool　After the dried wool is determined to be used for weaving what kind of woolen fabric, it must go through the wool blending process. For example, to weave high-grade woolen fabrics, Australian wool should be mixed with Shandong wool. To weave medium-grade woolen fabrics, Shandong wool should be mixed with Huzhou wool. This ensures that the material is strong and the cost is appropriate, maintaining the reputation of the products.</p>
<p>6.  Oiling　After washing, the wool is mostly ivory-colored. If it is used directly for spinning and weaving woolen fabrics, the wool will be light and easily fly away. The resulting products will be dull and lackluster. Therefore, after blending the wool, oil must be added to the wool and stirred repeatedly to make the wool shiny and reflective. Then, when it is used for spinning and weaving woolen fabrics, the resulting products will be bright and eye-catching.</p>
<p>7.  Carding Wool　After oiling, the wool is still mixed together, and the fibers are tightly bound. It cannot be spun into yarn unless it is carded loose.</p>
<p>8.  Combing Wool　Each wool combing machine has three frames. The first step is to turn the wool into a thin wadding and then into a roll. After being combed by the third machine, it becomes a wool thread.</p>
<p>9.  Spinning Yarn　After the wool is combed into threads, it is placed on a spinning machine to be spun into fine yarn. If it needs to be made into plied wool thread, it is placed on a plying machine. If it needs to be dyed, the wool yarn or wool fabric is placed on a yarn winding machine to wind it into bobbins.</p>
<p>10. Winding Yarn　After plying, if it is ready for sale, or if the spun yarn needs to be dyed, it must go through the yarn winding process to form skeins of yarn. There are many types of finished products, such as yarn for weaving woolen fabrics, camel down yarn, and wool yarn.</p>
<p>(2) Weaving</p>
<p>1.  Preparation　Preparation work includes warping and heddling, etc.</p>
<p>2.  Weaving Cloth　The structure of the weaving machine is roughly the same as that of ordinary silk weaving machines. However, the machine body is larger and can weave woolen fabrics with a width of seven or eight feet. Each machine is operated by two female workers. If a warp or weft thread breaks, the machine is stopped immediately to rejoin the thread, and then the machine is restarted to continue weaving. Therefore, the woven woolen fabrics rarely have broken threads from beginning to end.</p>
<p>(3) Finishing</p>
<p>1.  Inspection　After the woolen fabric is woven, it is inspected. If any defects are found, they are immediately handed over to female workers for repair.</p>
<p>2.  Mending　Mending mostly involves using tweezers to remove broken threads or using needles to repair pulled threads. However, upon close observation of the female workers on site, there were those mending broken threads, but none were found repairing pulled threads.</p>
<p>3.  Washing Cloth　The woolen fabric taken off the machine inevitably has oil stains or dirt. Therefore, all woven woolen fabrics must be washed. During washing, the woolen fabric is suspended in the air and then gradually immersed in water. The woolen fabric in the water is agitated and shaken by boiling water, which removes the stains. This process is repeated, and soon the entire piece of woolen fabric is cleaned, and then a second piece is replaced.</p>
<p>4.  Fulling Cloth　Fulling is done by using a machine to shrink the cloth, making the texture thicker.</p>
<p>5.  Drying Cloth　After fulling, the cloth is not completely dry and must be placed on a cloth drying machine to dry. One end of the machine is connected to a small room about two zhang (approximately 20 feet) long, where the temperature is extremely high. The wet cloth enters the room from the machine and must be looped back and forth four or five times in the room before being hung out from the bottom of the machine. By this point, it is completely dry.</p>
<p>6.  Raising the Nap　There are two types of machines for raising the nap. High-grade woolen fabrics are placed on a machine inlaid with plant shells (the shells resemble honeycombs and have many soft, sharp thorns on the surface, the name of which is unknown). Because the thorns are soft and sharp, the woolen fabric itself is not damaged after raising. Other lower-grade woolen fabrics, such as camel hair and military uniform cloth, are placed on a machine covered with steel wires for raising the nap. When we visited, we saw camel down being raised. When the camel down was not raised, it was as thin as terry cloth. After being raised on the raising machine three times, it not only increased in thickness several times, but the down quality was also soft, beautiful, and pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>9.  Shearing, Pressing, Steaming, Folding, and Measuring　After the woolen fabric is raised, it must go through many processes such as shearing, smoothing, ironing, pressing, steaming, folding, and measuring before it can be packaged. These processes are all done by machinery.</p>
<p>▲Development Plan　According to Mr. Wu, the following are some of the development plans that the factory is currently undertaking:</p>
<p>(1) Adding Night Shifts　The supply of Zhanghua products cannot meet the demand. To meet orders and reduce costs, night shifts will be started. According to the principles of scientific management and making the most of resources, there is no need for factories and machinery to rest. After adding night shifts, only an additional wage bill is incurred, while production can be doubled. In this way, the cost can be reduced, and the price can be lower, which will inevitably affect foreign goods.</p>
<p>(3) Purchasing New Machines　The factory's existing steam engine is expensive and inefficient. It is planned to replace all of them with electric motors soon. In addition, the factory currently lacks various machines for weaving high-grade woolen fabrics. A large batch has recently been ordered from England and will arrive soon.</p>
<p>Introduction to National Products</p>
<h3 id="e291">National Product: Handkerchiefs <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, 120 million [dollars] of our country's money flows into the hands of foreigners every year, year after year, and beautiful imported goods are imported more and more every year. As a result, the national products seen on the market are falling behind year by year. What a painful thing this is!</p>
<p>Many young men and women also feel sorry for this outflow of money, so they advocate national products. Thus, this year is called the "National Products Year," and everyone seems very enthusiastic. But after the five-minute enthusiasm passes, they are buying imported goods again.</p>
<p>The so-called modern men and women are dressed in well-tailored Western suits, and the women are dressed in modern fashions. The men often stuff a small handkerchief in a small pocket on the left side, and the women often stuff a small silk handkerchief in the middle of their silk buttons. Perhaps nine out of ten of these handkerchiefs are imported goods. It's really strange. Aren't there such handkerchiefs among our national products?</p>
<p>Handkerchiefs are indeed a practical item that is essential for daily use. Recently, imported handkerchiefs have flooded the market in countless numbers. If you are not careful when buying them, you may buy inferior goods, which is really a waste of money.</p>
<p>Now, I can introduce a genuine national product handkerchief, which is also an outstanding one among national products. It is the San Yang brand handkerchief manufactured by the Huada Handkerchief Factory, which was founded by Chinese nationals. Their raw materials are excellent, the styles are modern, and the colors are bright. Everything is comparable to imported goods. The factory is equipped with new-style machines and uses scientific manufacturing methods. The products are of good quality, so sales are expanding day by day. According to current calculations, the places that have been sold to include North China, South China, and Central China in the country, and the Nanyang Islands area abroad. Although the goods are being manufactured as quickly as possible, they are still not enough to be distributed, which also shows that our country's handkerchief industry is full of hope. I hope that all men and women compatriots in the country will quickly purchase national product handkerchiefs and not send valuable money into the hands of foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e292">National Product: Insulated Water Bottles <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Shang</p>
<p>Insulated water bottles are a daily necessity. Their effectiveness is especially noticeable in cold weather.</p>
<p>As long as a family has a thermos, they can have hot water to drink at any time, which is very convenient. Some people say that if the patriotism of the Chinese people could be like a thermos, keeping warm 24 hours a day, then hated foreign goods would definitely not sell so well in China. Although this is a humorous saying, it does contain profound meaning.</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder now! When buying thermos bottles, be sure to recognize them clearly and don't buy hated foreign goods. It is best to go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy the national product "99 Thermos Bottle." This type of bottle has a beautiful style, is accurate and durable, and can be said to be superior to foreign goods. As for the words "99," it means that each piece is only sold for 9 jiao and 9 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e293">A Year's History of National Products: The National Product Cosmetics Industry (3) <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Zhongting</p>
<p>(4) The Current Crisis of Cosmetics Factories</p>
<p>Imported cosmetics can be divided into Eastern and Western types. Eastern goods have gradually declined after repeated boycotts. Since occupying our Northeast, Chinese people have increasingly known to strive hard. Examining their sales in China, they only account for about 1% of our country's total. Western cosmetics are sold in the major cities of our country, deeply rooted and very prosperous. Although the strength of various factories is concentrated to compete with them, their popularity remains the same. This proves that the Chinese people's psychology of worshiping foreign goods is unbreakable, and this is especially true for those who are known as high-class Chinese and modern women. Foreign merchants have obtained huge profits and often use their authority of strong capital to be enemies of our Chinese factories. They usually spy on the market. If there is a fast-selling Chinese factory product, they will forcibly say that it is similar to their product and falsely accuse it of being a shadow. Therefore, the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and the courts often have such cases. If our country's large factories are involved, they can deal with it in a just manner. However, small factories with limited funds and timidity often compromise and voluntarily destroy the disputed trademark and no longer use it. Then, foreign merchants are complacent, and our country's small factories are destroyed.</p>
<p>At the same time, cosmetics factories, with the purpose of making profits, often develop a morbid psychology. Knowing that Chinese people like to use foreign goods, they use foreign characters on their products and mark them with the names of foreign firms. Buyers do not examine carefully and are easily deceived. On the surface, manufacturers and sellers can make excuses to compete with foreign goods. However, examining their intentions, they have the suspicion of forgetting their ancestors. It is more accurate to say that sellers do not know how to love the country than to say that buyers do not know how to love the country.</p>
<p>In addition, mutual infighting among the same industry can put the future of the cosmetics industry in an irretrievable situation. It is common to see several similar products on the market for a fast-selling product. Their names, decorations, etc., are almost indistinguishable. This inside story does not need to be explained. It is obviously done by people who are greedy for profit. As a result, they lower prices to compete with each other. Eventually, the price decreases and the workmanship becomes inferior. They lose the trust of customers and then stop. This kind of psychology of seeing profit and forgetting righteousness is extremely despicable. It is absolutely not possible to forgive them by using the words "only knowing how to imitate but having no creativity." In the past, sales in Southeast Asia were over one million per year, of which Guang Sheng Hang, Sincere Company, and Wing On Enterprise Company accounted for a particularly dominant position. It is not easy to achieve such results in foreign trade. However, overseas Chinese merchants have recently become indifferent to national products. The reason is that various factories imitate each other. Their weaknesses of cutting corners and producing crudely can be concealed temporarily, but they will be exposed eventually. Therefore, this good market, which has been painstakingly managed for many years, has been destroyed by a small number of unscrupulous colleagues, and they sit back and watch as Japanese goods replace it. In our country's immature cosmetics industry, is this not extremely heartbreaking in history?</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>The cosmetics industry is under the pressure of internal and external troubles, as mentioned above. If this continues and no efforts are made to progress, the future is really worrying. Therefore, today, cosmetics factories in our country urgently need to cheer up, thoroughly correct their past mistakes, unite sincerely, and coordinate their steps to prepare for a frontal impact with foreign goods. The effective steps that should be taken are to focus on improving the "quality," increasing the "quantity," lowering the "price," and opening up the "market." Chemical experts should also be hired to research how to manufacture the raw materials of cosmetics and implement them to supply various factories for application. In this way, they can no longer depend on others. Otherwise, even if imported cosmetics can disappear from China, the leak in raw materials will not be plugged, and in fact, it will still be of no help. Although there are conflicts of interest in the operations of various factories, they should all strive to improve the material itself to find a way out. There are still not many satisfactory products on the market, and there are plenty of opportunities for promotion. Do not do things that harm others and do not benefit yourself to drive yourself to depravity or even cause the entire cosmetics industry to suffer a bad influence. If the goods are of good quality and low price, Chinese people, except for a small number of the bourgeoisie who must use foreign goods to show their wealth, will be able to shift their habits as long as they know that the interests of the country are the premise. Commentators often attribute the obstruction of sales of national products to the fact that users do not know how to promote them. I think it is difficult to convince people with this statement before the products are sufficiently refined and the prices are as low as possible. Try to study the reasons why Eastern goods were overthrown in the past, and you can think about it for half the time. People are forced to act by strength. We can only resist with strength. We can only boycott with empty words or make meaningless sighs. Neither is a strong performance. If we can be down-to-earth and continue to use the strength that overthrew Eastern goods in the past and enrich it, then it will not be difficult to exclude Western goods from the territory, and national products will have a day to rise again. I hope that this arduous mission will be shouldered together with our cosmetics industry.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3 id="e294">Free Talk: An Explanation of "Humor" <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Su</p>
<p>People who study world literature tell us: the French are good at wit, the Russians are good at satire, and the British and Americans are good at humor. This is probably true, as it is all limited by social conditions. Ever since Master Yutang promoted "humor," this term has become very popular, but with popularity comes crisis, just like soldiers calling themselves Buddhists, high officials suddenly wearing rosary beads, and Buddhism is about to enter Nirvana. If glibness, frivolousness, and obscenity are all labeled "humor," then it is just like "new plays" entering the "X World," and it will undoubtedly become "civilized plays."</p>
<p>This danger is because China has never been very humorous. There is glibness, but humor is still a long way off. The Japanese translated "humor" as "affectionate glibness," so it is different from mere "glibness," and that is why. Then, in China, can only glib articles be found? But not really. Chinese articles that think they are glib are still glib, frivolous, and obscene, and are different from true glibness. The key to this "raccoon dog swapping prince" is that the so-called serious remarks and facts in the past are mostly glib, and people are used to seeing them, gradually thinking they are normal, and then mistakenly recognize glibness as glibness.</p>
<p>To find glibness in China, you should not read so-called glib articles, but read so-called serious things, but you must think about it. These famous articles are readily available, such as the serious titles in newspapers, such as "Gradually Entering a Better State" and "Where is China Going," which are all like olives when chewed, with some aftertaste.</p>
<p>There are also some in the advertisements in newspapers. We know that there is a publication that calls itself the "new authority in the opinion world" and "says what ordinary people want to say but have not said," while at the same time "declaring a misunderstanding and expressing apologies" to another publication, but also saying that "both parties are reputable publications in the society and have no reason to attack each other." A "new authority" who is good at "misunderstandings," "misunderstands" but is "reputable," and "says what ordinary people want to say but have not said" is a misunderstanding and an apology: to not laugh at this, you must not be able to think.</p>
<p>There are also some in the short comments in newspapers. For example, in September, "Free Talk" published "Lost Treasures of the Art of Climbing the Dragon," which regarded marrying a rich man's daughter as one of the "arts of climbing the dragon," and soon attracted a counterattack, which began by saying: "The fox can't eat grapes, so it says the grapes are sour. He can't marry a rich wife, so he is jealous of everyone who marries a rich family. The result of jealousy is attack." You can't think about this either. Thinking about the "result" clearly shows that this author is stating that he knows that the taste of "rich wife" is sweet.</p>
<p>We have also seen similar wonderful articles in grand and formal official documents: and they are not caricatured, but they are originally cartoons. In "The Analects" of one year, I like to read the "Gu Xiang Zhai" column the most, such as the order of the magistrate of Yingshan County, Sichuan, prohibiting the wearing of long gowns, saying: "It must be known that clothes are enough to cover the body, why drag them back and forth, wasting cloth? And the power is weak... Considering the difficult times, what dire consequences can be imagined?" Another example is the article prohibiting women from raising male dogs in a certain place, saying: "It is found that the coexistence of female women and male dogs is not only harmful to health, but also easily leads to shameless and obscene rumors. In our country, which is a land of etiquette, it is also not allowed by custom. This is a special order to strictly prohibit... All male dogs raised by women will be beheaded without pardon, so as to rectify!" Where can a glib writer write this out of thin air?</p>
<p>However, the wonderful articles collected by "Gu Xiang Zhai" often tend to be bizarre (Grotesk), but glibness is not as good as plainness, and because it is plain, it is even more glib. On this standard, I recommend the "Sweet Grapes" statement.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Performance of "Roar, China!" <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yi</p>
<p>"Roar, China!" was already performed last month, but due to other matters, I missed the opportunity. Tonight is the last day and last performance of the second run, so I had to go see it no matter what.</p>
<p>I sat in the theater for a while before the curtain finally opened. Scene after scene passed, and I watched it all in one go.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance of this play, I would like to say a few words.</p>
<p>(1) The script. This script was written by a foreigner and has caused a sensation in theater circles around the world. Naturally, it has its value. However, is its power of expression sufficient? This is a question worth considering. When I read the script, I didn't feel it, but after watching the performance tonight, I discovered its weakness. This is partly due to the performers making slight modifications to the script, such as deleting the superstitious characters like the monk and the immortal swordsman who believe that a piece of yellow cloth can ward off bullets; the action of the university student kneeling and begging the captain; the reason for the tea boy's suicide, and so on. On the other hand, it is also due to the original author's insufficient depiction of the naked oppression of imperialism towards the people in the colonies, the cruel methods used, and the suffering of the colonized people resisting the oppression. As a result, the whole play feels loose. Perhaps because the author is a foreigner and does not fully understand the cruel situation of the Chinese people being oppressed, or perhaps because the translation of the script is not good, in short, the play does not feel very tense or profound.</p>
<p>(2) The technique of the performance. This can be discussed from several aspects.</p>
<p>A. Actors. Among the actors, the makeup of those playing foreigners is really bad, they simply don't look like foreigners. In terms of performance, only the captain and the American merchant buying cowhide were relatively better. The rest failed to show the demeanor of a foreigner, especially the women. Among the workers, the second boatman and his wife were a little better. The stoker is the most important character in the whole play, but the actor failed to fulfill the mission he shouldered in the script, and his movements were very artificial and clumsy. Only the old boatman and the boatman's old [illegible character] were passable. As for the university student, he was terrible. Originally, in the script, he was afraid when he boarded the warship, but the actor portrayed him as a brave and fearless figure. This error in characterization is probably the responsibility of the director!</p>
<p>B. Scenery. The scenery this time can be said to be the most magnificent on the Chinese stage. However, it still doesn't look very real. The cannons on the warship are obviously fake, the high lookout post is also very simple, the handrails and iron bars are shaky, and the cannons are connected to the lookout post, which I have never seen before. The scene of the dock in the first scene doesn't look like it at all, and the ships are completely different from the real ones. The scene of the small cigarette shop is a little better, but the door is too pretty. The dock scene is the best set, but it is still not real, and it shakes every time it is touched. Another point is that the backstage staff did not eliminate the past shortcomings and were always moving around behind the scenery.</p>
<p>C. Lighting. The lighting is really bad, always moving, strong, and without a specific direction. The searchlight was supposed to shine down from the lookout post, but they made it shine from the front of the lookout post. If that's not a searchlight, then what is it for? If it is said to be a searchlight from elsewhere, there is absolutely no reason for it to shine on the warship. The lighting in the small hotel is even more strange, the light from outside is stronger than the light inside. We ask, was there a moon that night? Was there a street lamp right outside the door?</p>
<p>(3) The overall performance and effect. The entire performance of the play can be said to be powerless. The actors' movements, expressions, and words cannot move the audience or give them a deep impression, and completely fail to produce the effect of the play. The expression of the consciousness of several different characters is also not fully revealed. It can be said that the effect of this play is only to leave people with the impression that there was such a thing, without making them understand the ferocity of imperialism and the suffering of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say to the Theater Association and friends in the theater world with the utmost sincerity: please put more effort into this undertaking and expand its power so that all the people who are suffering as much as the workers in the play can see and hear it!</p>

<p>Last year, also at this time of day, with the sun setting and the low murmur of falling leaves making the silence even more profound.</p>
<p>I walked through the dusty streets, dragging my tired legs into my house.</p>
<p>My house seemed shrouded in a layer of mist, and the old rooms were even more so.</p>
<p>My mother, looking haggard, lay on a chaise lounge, her thin, bony hand covering her forehead.</p>
<p>Even the slightest sound of footsteps startled her:</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Her voice was gentle, weak, and dim.</p>
<p>"It's me..." I immediately felt uneasy and sad.</p>
<p>"You're back?"</p>
<p>She sighed, seemingly falling asleep again.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Reply to "Also for Your Consideration" <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>After writing an article titled "Missing Out" a few days ago, I didn't want to say anything more about "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature." The next day, I saw Mr. Shi Zhicun's "Letter to Mr. Li Liewen" on "Free Talk," which was also "for my consideration," so I will say a few more words. Because I feel that Mr. Shi's three rebuttals are all beside the point:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Shi said that since "some new youths can have old ideas, and some old forms can contain new content," then the old ideas of someone like him, "a limb of the remaining subjects of the fallen dynasty," can be left unexamined, and writing ancient texts like "Zhuangzi" is also permissible. Of course, if one wants to write like that, one can also say it is "permissible," and the universe will certainly not be destroyed because of it. But I always believe that today's youths don't necessarily have to abandon vernacular writing and instead go and diligently study "Zhuangzi," learning its grammar to write articles. As for leaving it unexamined, that is certainly possible, but what harm is there in discussing it? Mr. Shi, regarding the clumsy and straightforward grammar and scant vocabulary of the youths, and my "reminiscing about the past," wasn't he unwilling to "leave it unexamined"?</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Shi believes that "selecting officials based on literary style" and advising youths to read "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature" have a difference between "coercion" and "contribution," and my analogy is not accurate. But I don't know, when Mr. Shi was a Chinese language teacher, whether he considered students' compositions that were rich in "Zhuangzi" grammar and "Selections of Refined Literature" vocabulary to be excellent, and after becoming an editor, also considered such works to be the top choice? If so, then if he were an "examiner," I think he would select officials based on "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature."</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Shi also cites Lu Xun's words, saying that he once said: (1) "Young people read Chinese books, the result is only not being able to write." This shows that he acknowledged that in order to be able to write, one should read more Chinese books; (2) "...I think that if one wants to study the old, it is better to rely on Zhang Zhidong's 'Book List with Answers' to find the way." This shows that he did not oppose young people reading ancient books. This is because Mr. Shi overlooked the time and environment. When he said the lines in (1), it was precisely when many people were clamoring for vernacular writing and that one must read ancient books, so those lines were aimed at them, saying that even if it were just as they said, it would only be not being able to write, and going to read ancient books would be even more harmful than not being able to write. As for (2), it clearly specifies young people studying old literature, which is vastly different from Mr. Shi's proposition, involving the general. If we want to study the history of ancient Chinese literature, don't we still have to read the "Book of Changes" and the "Book of Documents"?</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Shi said that when he was filling out that book list, he was not as serious as I speculated, I think this statement is true. Let us try to imagine, if there really was such a young student, obediently following orders, after a period of painstaking effort, used "Zhuangzi's" grammar and "Selections of Refined Literature's" vocabulary to write an article expounding the morality of the "Analects," "Mencius," and "Yan Family Instructions," "wouldn't that be too ridiculous"?</p>
<p>However, my "nostalgia" is serious. I am not doing it to "gain more followers," nor because I hate Mr. Shi for not recommending "Hua Gai Collection: Supplement" and "False Freedom Book"; nor is there any other "motive," such as because I got fewer points when I was a student, or my manuscript was confiscated when I submitted it, and now I am using this to take personal revenge.</p>

<p>— Written by Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>When the ship docked, the sailor Papa Grelot, who was waiting there, took the two women by the hand and helped them ashore; then everyone entered the city. There were many idlers on the street, all those who went to the seawall every day at high tide to idle around, and they were also returning.</p>
<p>Mother Roland and Mrs. Lure walked in front, followed by the three men. When walking along Paris Road, they sometimes stopped in front of a hat shop or a jewelry store, carefully looking at a hat or a piece of jewelry; then, after expressing some opinions to each other, they walked away again.</p>
<p>In front of the Bourse Square, Old Roland, as usual, gazed at the trading port, which was full of ships and extended by other harbors, the huge hulls of the ships moored there in four or five rows, belly to belly. The countless masts leaning against the pier for several kilometers, all the masts attached to sails, rigging, and mastheads, made the gap in the city center look like a large dead forest. Some seagulls circled under this leafless forest, waiting for someone to throw some scraps into the water, then they flew straight down like a stone falling; and a young boy learning to be a sailor was installing a pulley at the top of a high mast, looking as if he was climbing up there to look for bird nests.</p>
<p>"Would you like to have a simple dinner with us and end the day together?" Mother Roland asked Mrs. Lure.</p>
<p>"That would be wonderful. I accept without hesitation. After spending a day together like this, it would be very lonely to run home alone," Mrs. Lure replied.</p>
<p>Pierre, who had heard these words and had long felt embarrassed by the young woman's coldness towards him, said softly, "Good, this widow is now inserting herself into our family." In recent days, he had been calling this woman "the widow." Although this term did not explain anything, it made Jean feel resentful when he heard the tone. To him, this term was sinister and contained insulting implications.</p>
<p>So the three men did not say a word until they reached the door of their residence. This residence was a narrow, three-story house located on Perman Street. Their maid Josephine was a nineteen-year-old girl, a cheap servant who came from the countryside, with a face particularly rich in the kind of surprise and crudeness that is found in country folk. She ran to open the door, let everyone in, and then closed the door, following her masters to the living room on the second floor, and then said, "A gentleman has come three times."</p>
<p>Old Roland, who couldn't help but roar every time he spoke to this maid, shouted:</p>
<p>"Who came, doesn't he have a name?"</p>
<p>She was never flustered by her master's roars, and she said again:</p>
<p>"A gentleman from the notary's (Nolaile) house."</p>
<p>"Which notary?"</p>
<p>"Well, let's just say from Mr. Carrou's house."</p>

<h3 id="e299">Temperaments of Northerners and Southerners <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>In the conversations of friends, there are often such jokes: "Foxes from Jiangnan," "Shan Dong brutes," "Hunan barbarians," "Jiangxi yokels," etc. Except for "Shan Dong brutes," which specifically refers to their large size, the rest seem to be able to be regarded as observations of temperament.</p>
<p>Speaking of temperament, in China, northerners and southerners certainly have their own temperaments, each province has its own temperament, and even different counties, a small region has its own special and distinctive temperament.</p>
<p>However, broadly speaking, we can summarize it with the two major systems of "north" and "south."</p>
<p>People who live in the north have these characteristics:</p>
<p>First, they are forthright. Han Yu said in his "Preface to Sending Off Dong Sheng": "Yan and Zhao have been known since ancient times for having many generous and tragic singers." This is indeed true. Northerners, whether speaking or doing things, are generally very forthright, not so fussy and circuitous, not speaking one thing and thinking another, not acting without regard to words.</p>
<p>Second, they are very conservative. To make a long story short, it is inevitable to involve social evolutionary history, that is, northern society undoubtedly still has a very strong feudal remnant. The characteristic of feudal society is conservatism, so northerners cannot escape the encompassing control of this social consciousness, and everyone is somewhat conservative. Not to mention major events, even in dealing with daily trivial matters, they often like to sing the tune of "Xiao Gui Cao Sui," following the rules and walking in the right path, unwilling to move forward with great strides and seek new gains.</p>
<p>Third, they are particularly particular about etiquette. This may originate from the fact that our old-brand sages were all produced in the north, and because our country's culture is based here, the dynasties have changed, and etiquette has been deeply engraved in the minds of ordinary people, not only becoming a habit, but simply becoming a kind of inherited temperament. When dealing with people, they all diligently reciprocate etiquette. If you say they are just hypocritical, they are not really, in short, northerners mostly have a characteristic of liking to talk about etiquette.</p>
<p>Speaking of southerners, they also have several prominent characteristics:</p>
<p>First, they are cunning. I often think that the saying "Foxes from Jiangnan" has quite a history. We know that foxes are cunning beasts, and the people of the Jiangzhe area are mostly not out of the category of white-faced scholars, oily tongues and slippery mouths, speaking one thing and meaning another, and putting on airs. This is probably due to the more advanced and complex society and the difficulty of living. Other factors such as beautiful mountains and clear waters and the nurturing of spirits also have a certain relationship. For example, the people of "Paradise Suzhou and Hangzhou" are particularly clever and cunning. In addition, the particularly developed commerce and the merchants are good at "fraud," which can also be regarded as having a considerable connection.</p>
<p>Second, they have a characteristic of adventure and initiative. This can be illustrated by two facts: one is that the adventurers who went abroad as overseas Chinese are almost all southerners from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong; the second is the outbreak of revolutionary undertakings. To put it further, after more than two hundred years of Manchu rule, it was only Guangxi's Hong Xiuquan and his ilk who dared to rush forward, and although the matter was not successful, it was indeed a model. Then Mr. Sun Yat-sen came out to launch an uprising, and the Xinhai Revolution was able to succeed. Since then, the Northern Expedition of fifteen years, all the way to the present, can all explain the southerners. Standing on a certain position at the time, this initiative is a kind of bad temperament. But in fact, if you ask them to be quieter and more well-behaved, they really won't listen. They would rather have their heads cut off than not take risks. If they don't go overseas, they will rush into the country. This kind of restlessness and exploration of further progress is indeed necessary for social evolution.</p>
<p>Third, they are barbarous. For example, the people of Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou are prevalent with barbarism, a head-on confrontation, being tough is considered a good man. In geography textbooks, there is a narrative that "the people of Hunan are mostly barbarous." The "Sichuan Army," "Guangxi Army," and "Hunan Army" are all very famous, they just love to do this, if they do it skillfully, they will become great generals and heroes, and they don't think it is strange to fight tigers. This has a lot to do with the degree of civilization. In these provinces, there are still large numbers of Miao and indigenous people living intermixed. As for culture and literati, they are naturally relatively low and lacking.</p>
<p>The differences between the temperaments of northerners and southerners have been outlined above. Whether forthright or cunning, neither is a good phenomenon. We feel that in the same nation, there can only be a unified and beautiful national character, and there should be no temperament that varies according to the region. But our nation is actually like this, [illegible character] national character is not unified and beautiful, and the temperaments of various places are like this.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>intense development, no wonder "a heap of loose sand," "each scheming for himself." Where does the reason lie? (1) It cannot but be attributed to the inconvenience of transportation. There are no natural rivers running through the north and south (even a short canal is silted up), and there is no railway running directly through the north and south. What about highways is even more unnecessary to say. (2) Education is not universal, the illiteracy rate is above 80 percent, and there is no unified national language. Of course, there is a lack of tools and possibilities for contact and integration between people. To prescribe the right medicine, it depends on the keen understanding of those who plan for the country. Written in a pigeon cage-like small room on a night of autumn winds and autumn rains.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Mother and Daughter <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Lao San</p>
<p>After that talkative old woman had several conversations with Mrs. Lu in the Lu mansion, Miss Lu's marriage could be resolved with just one more matchmaking session, and at the same time, it would also relieve the burden that Mrs. Lu had been carrying on her shoulders for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Although it was a large Lu mansion with black walls, besides Mrs. Lu and Miss Lu, there were only the male and female servants hired by them. Mrs. Lu's husband, Mr. Lu, passed away very early, probably when Miss Lu was only two or three years old. Fortunately, he left them a house and a lot of savings, so there was naturally no problem with their livelihood. However, Mrs. Lu [illegible character] at that time, of course, she was still young Mrs. Lu, thinking about being widowed at a young age, she tried to commit suicide several times. Mrs. Lu's mother was still alive, and she advised her daughter day and night, saying: "Although the son-in-law died so early, what he left behind is enough for you and your daughter to spend. This girl will have a son to rely on in the future, isn't the mother herself like this? Young people, don't be so impetuous, it will make people laugh!"</p>
<p>Later, Mrs. Lu did not know whether it was for the sake of having a son to rely on in the future, or for fear of being laughed at? She painstakingly raised her daughter, Miss Lu.</p>
<p>Miss Lu grew to be fifteen years old, truly [illegible character] said to be as beautiful as a fish sinking and a goose falling, as beautiful as a flower closing under the moon, a lovely girl. Mrs. Lu saw that half of her hopes had been realized, and that the remaining money of Mr. Lu was still all spent on this daughter; she very generously sent her daughter to a girls' school to study, and Mrs. Lu actively did the work of the second half of her hopes.</p>
<p>However, the times were not the times, and everything changed when Miss Lu entered school. Making a fuss about cutting her hair was still a small matter, the clothes she made were all things that Mrs. Lu [illegible character] had never seen before, such strange clothes, but thinking that she only had this one daughter, she loved [illegible character] her, and besides, these kinds of clothes seemed to look especially beautiful on her daughter [illegible character].</p>
<p>Slowly, things changed again. Miss Lu never turned a hundred books every day when she came home, and she was always writing those messy letters with her head down, one after another, filling the paper box. Mrs. Lu herself was illiterate, and at first she thought it was homework from school, but later a tailor who often came in and out of her home accidentally discovered that there were many words of brothers and sisters crying on it. Only then did Mrs. Lu become anxious, her lovely daughter, don't be driven away by those wild men, so she locked her daughter up at home, not allowing her to go to school anymore, and on the one hand, she accelerated the process of inviting matchmaker Wang Ma to her home to discuss secretly, entrusting her grandmother to find a husband for Miss Lu, and promising a heavy wish.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, under heavy reward, there must be brave men. Wang Ma's pair of arm-like feet ran in and out of the black walls of the Lu mansion dozens of times, and it was agreed that a son was the only child of a silver shop owner. He was so good-looking, he and Miss Lu were a perfect match, and he had graduated from some university, and his family was rich, of course, there was no need to say. As soon as she opened the silver box, Mrs. Lu smiled with joy. However, the man's family wanted to see the young lady. In Mrs. Lu's opinion, what did my daughter have to compare to others? She didn't want to do it in such a strange way, giving her spoiled daughter to others to watch like a commodity. Of course, Wang Ma's feet were needed again, but the man's family insisted on seeing the young lady first. Wang Ma's good-talking mouth said a lot, what kind of family, what kind of family, she did the matchmaking, everyone matched before seeing each other, and then what nowadays, young ladies and young masters have to see each other themselves, so that they don't complain about their parents in the future. Mrs. Lu was moved by her words. Now that it was so, she made an appointment for a day to let herself see what kind of person the son-in-law was.</p>
<p>Wang Ma ran back and forth for more than a month [illegible character] on [illegible character] auspicious day [illegible character] ran out the date for the matchmaking, the two families [illegible character], made an appointment to watch a play in the theater [illegible character]. [illegible character] Tan [illegible character] [illegible character] [illegible character] [illegible character] [illegible character] [illegible character] [illegible character] [illegible character] [illegible character] On the family side, although there were only two people, mother and daughter, they had very different opinions. Miss Lu was a female student who had studied, and she didn't want anything to do with this kind of playboy-like silver shop scion. Mrs. Lu thought that as long as the son-in-law's face was not missing an eye or a mouth, what made her ten thousand times willing was that the family opened a silver shop, and she had lived her life for the sake of having a son to rely on. How could she let go of such a son-in-law lightly, so the mother and daughter argued day and night, and Wang Ma listened for news three times a day. . . . . . .</p>

<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Since [illegible character] practiced playing the qin and came out, passing by XX Road, I saw a long snake-like line of many rickshaws, next to the rickshaws stood men wearing tattered old blue cloth shirts, with their sleeves rolled up high and their trouser legs also rolled up high, wearing straw sandals, they were extraordinarily quiet, waiting like they were on trial. I didn't know the riddle in it, so even though I had passed this large group of rickshaws, I turned back to see what it was all about. Ah! It turned out to be an XX Rickshaw Company. At the main entrance there was a round thing similar to a table, with pencils and paper on it, and next to it stood a tall "foreign master," writing something I didn't know. Next to the "foreign master" was a short, thin, and bony Chinese man, wearing a green [illegible character] uniform, holding a stick in his hand, this was probably the so-called "foreman." A yellow-faced rickshaw puller pulled a rickshaw out, passing between the two men of particularly disparate height, he walked slowly, trembling. As he passed the Chinese foreman, the foreman glared at him, raised the stick in his hand, and blocked the rickshaw's path. Then, he diligently opened the rickshaw box, looking at the "foreign master" with a kind look, waiting for the "foreign master" to examine it sideways. The short, yellow-faced foreman looked up at the foreign master's breath, his attitude was really strange. Only when the "foreign master" slightly nodded his head did the foreman wave the stick violently. The rickshaw puller seemed like a prisoner released from the criminal court, and desperately ran away. The same rickshaws were all subjected to the same inspection. (Actually, I don't know what they were inspecting, I really don't know). After the inspection, the rickshaws lined up in an orderly fashion in front of the company's gate, the rickshaw pullers, all with their hands tied, were waiting outside the gate for the second trial, the second "order" of the "foreign master" like obedient sheep.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has gone from being special to becoming commonplace. But the rickshaw puller, with his two strong legs and a body full of stinky sweat, protecting the one or two mao he earned, he seemed to have no idea that he had cheaply sold his entire body and soul to obey the "foreign master's" orders. But when the customer exploits him for one or two cents of his leg money, he will show his eyes, scold him angrily, and give him a white eye, not to mention adding the respectful phrase "Your mother's?"</p>
<p>Here, we also say like Mozi, "…Now there is a person here who sees little black and white ink, but sees a lot of black and white: then this person will be regarded as not knowing the distinction between black and white. Taste little bitter, call it bitter: taste a lot of bitter and sweet: then this person must be regarded as not knowing the distinction between sweet and bitter.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Family Letters and Love Letters <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Kai Yu</p>
<p>I have lived the life of a student for over a decade. If I were to compare the attitudes of students towards their families and towards their lovers over these ten-plus years, I might be able to write a small booklet. However, time never permits me to do so, so I will start by discussing family letters and love letters.</p>
<p>Words are symbols of language, which no one can deny. Letters are written using words, and naturally, they are for exchanging information. However, even though they are both letters, students write them differently depending on whether they are family letters or love letters. When writing love letters, it seems like the words are alive, flowing endlessly. But when it comes to family letters, the words become dead, and they remain silent. Just looking at the bookstores now, elaborately bound love letter collections are becoming more and more common, while family letters are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, which proves everything. Love letters flourish, family letters decline – perhaps this statement can become a law, at least in the student world today. Without empty talk, let me cite a classmate's experience as evidence:</p>
<p>A certain classmate said that when he writes love letters, he always writes endlessly, not only in large quantities but also of high quality. He said that one night, after the sleep bell had already rung, and all the students were preparing to sleep, he lit a candle and wrote a thousand words, from acquaintance to first love, from first love to passionate love, from passionate love to kissing and hugging... Before he knew it, he had written more than two-thirds of fifty sheets of paper, and when he finished, he still felt a lingering regret that the paper was too short to express his feelings. However, when he writes family letters, he feels dry and tasteless, and other than "I am currently in financial straits, please remit ○○ yuan immediately," he has nothing to say. He said that he had inquired about this situation from many students in love, and the results were all the same. Now he wants to implement a method of using printing to replace family letters with several classmates. When writing, they only need to fill in the blanks, saving the time to write more love letters. It is truly killing two birds with one stone. The letter format is as follows:</p>
<p>"Dear Parents: Your child is currently experiencing financial difficulties. Modern Celebrity Paintings and Calligraphy</p>
<h3 id="e303">Mr. Zhu Lesan's Ink Plum Blossom (Brief Biography) <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Lesan, courtesy name Xizhai, also known as the Nanyu Mountain Man, is a native of Xiaofeng, Zhejiang. He loves poetry, is skilled in seal carving, and paints in the style of seal script. He has received awards. Mr. [blank] closely [blank] resembles his teacher.</p>
<p>I hope you will remit ○○ yuan to alleviate my urgent needs. I respectfully request</p>
<p>Blessings. Your child, ○○, respectfully reports on ○ month ○ day."</p>
<p>From my observations as a student, what a certain classmate reported is all true. As for using printing to replace family letters, perhaps it can only be found in a certain gentleman and his several classmates. However, if you [blank] gather [blank] family letters and compare them with the above letter format, I think the difference will be at most fifty steps to a hundred steps away.</p>
<p>When parents see the above facts, they will inevitably cry out in unison. When lovers see it, they will certainly grin and laugh. One laugh and one cry are as different as heaven and earth. But parents, don't panic! Watch quietly. Lovers, a turn of the body becomes father.</p>

<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am a young woman approaching adulthood. Two years ago, I happily graduated from elementary school and was planning to enter higher primary school. Unfortunately, my father's business failed, and he declared bankruptcy, becoming utterly destitute. Therefore, I dropped out of school. After dropping out, in addition to working, I spend my free time reading books and newspapers to increase my knowledge. I enjoy reading your column the most, and I admire your answers immensely. Now I also have an urgent question that I would like to trouble you to guide me on.</p>
<p>My only mother, who loved and cared for me in this world, has passed away, and my father is also old. I have no hope of relying on my parents in the future. But as I grow older year by year, I still have no skills for making a living. Therefore, I am eager to find a proper position to learn a skill as a foundation for my future life. But I don't know what kind of profession is a proper profession for women. Like movie stars, I have no talent and cannot do it. I am not qualified to be a clerk in foreign firms, organizations, or banks, and I cannot handle it. Company and store clerks have a bad reputation (i.e., "flower vase"), and I am not very willing to do it in my heart. Ah! I am confused! I really have no way to think of it. I can only ask you, sir, for guidance. Please answer me! Sir, I wish you</p>
<p>Good health. Respectfully, Ouyang Huizhen</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Miss Ouyang, because her mother is deceased and her father is old, she is concerned about the future and has no security in her life. She wants to find a suitable profession to support herself. This is very reasonable and very necessary. In fact, even if a woman does not have Miss Ouyang's kind of circumstances, she also needs to find a profession. In this era of fierce competition for survival, no nation can allow at least half of its women to only consume and not produce. Even if women are not considering their individual or family life, they should also consider the economy of the entire nation and engage in production. There are many consumers and few producers, and this situation cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>Miss Ouyang, because she does not have the talent for professions such as movie stars, does not dare to try. For clerks in organizations, foreign firms, banks, etc., because she cannot handle it, she does not dare to act rashly. This shows that she has a good understanding of herself. Originally, whether we are male or female, we must never gamble and risk trying things that do not suit our talents or that we cannot handle, because in the end, we will inevitably be eliminated. It's like using a stone mortar to act in a play, putting in a lot of effort but getting no good results. As for you saying that some professions have a bad reputation like "flower vase," so you don't want to do it, this is wrong. We should know that this kind of unpleasant argument, besides the speaker losing their personality, does not cause us any loss at all. Moreover, in this era of advocating women's professions, we need a large number of women with a great fearless spirit to fight against these vandals. After women's professions become widespread, and after women's professions have considerable achievements, this kind of demon will naturally retreat.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act IV: Praise of Peace</p>
<p>Japanese Soldier C: (Enters from outside) Report! The company commander ordered me to tell you to quickly search every house. It's getting late, hurry back to the city! (Exits)</p>
<p>Japanese Officer: (Orders Japanese Soldier A) Then you take this group of bastards to the ancestral hall over there and wait until we catch more bandits and take them all back to the city.</p>
<p>(The Japanese officer orders the Japanese soldiers and youths A, B, C, and D to leave. The women and children are frightened and cry.)</p>
<p>Security Team A: Zhou Sanye, what's going on now? Our guns have been confiscated, and our superiors will beat us when we go back.</p>
<p>Village Chief: There's nothing I can do.</p>
<p>Security Team B: No, we were brought here by you, so you are responsible now.</p>
<p>Village Chief: How can I be responsible for this? You were just unlucky to run into Japanese soldiers. There's nothing anyone can do. When the Japanese soldiers attacked Shenyang, even young Marshal Zhang did not dare to resist, let alone us?</p>
<p>Security Team A: We don't care, we want Zhou Sanye to be responsible. We can't go back without guns.</p>
<p>Village Chief: That's not true. Go back boldly. If your superiors want to punish you, you can ask them. If they were in this situation, what could they do? Surely our three lives are not as important as three guns, right? ... Old woman, come and collect this corpse. It stinks a lot here, it's awful.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Woman B: Bullshit! You can just kill someone and be done with it?</p>
<p>Village Chief: What do you want? (Emphasizing)</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Woman A: We want your life.</p>
<p>Village Chief: Bullshit, do you recognize this master?</p>
<p>Crowd A: We recognize you as a skinny dog.</p>
<p>Crowd: Down with him! Beat this skinny dog!</p>
<p>Village Chief: Come on, fire!</p>
<p>Security Team A: Where are the guns?</p>
<p>Village Chief: Oh? (Wants to escape)</p>
<p>(Woman B first grabs the village chief's collar and slaps him several times. The crowd swarms up, hitting and kicking. The two security team members are also beaten badly. Soon, the three are tied up and kneel in the center of the stage, their faces covered in blood.)</p>
<p>Young Woman: Damn it, you have this day too.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Woman A: We have been bullied enough by him, and now he is kneeling in front of us. Is there anyone here? Let's all bite off a piece of his flesh.</p>
<p>Village Chief: Heavens! I can't take it. Everyone, do a good deed, and the Bodhisattva will bless you. (Knocks his head)</p>
<p>Young Woman: Now you want to ask the Bodhisattva?</p>
<p>Crowd B: Who has a knife? Kill him! Keeping him will only harm us later.</p>
<p>Village Chief: God, do a good deed!</p>
<p>Crowd A: No, first he has to burn all our IOUs.</p>
<p>Crowd B: Good, his land deeds should also be burned.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, there is a dense burst of gunfire, followed by a landslide-like loud sound.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Woman A: Oh, the war has started again.</p>
<p>Crowd A: This must be the volunteers fighting the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Young Woman: Then let's go quickly. What are we doing here? They will be fighting over here soon.</p>
<p>(Everyone scatters. The old man's body is also moved offstage)</p>
<p>Village Chief: Hey, please let me go!</p>
<p>Crowd: Bah! (Gunfire)</p>
