<h3>深入民間　都</h3>
<p>魯省主席韓復榘。最近出巡膠東各縣。報載其于檢閲團隊視察行政而外。並能關懷民瘼。鋭圖匡拂。所至召集民衆。躬與周旋。遇有瀆職殃民之公務人員。無不以嚴厲之手段。定黜陟于俄頃。如棲霞縣長于寳棟以懈于職事撤任。管獄員以虐待囚犯罰役。文登承審員以積案太多被革。掖縣縣長以收受禮物降叙。烟濰路職員以强奸民女槍决。痛快淋漓。一洗官塲歷來依違苟且之惡習。蓋韓氏以軍人綜攬省政於奮勵之中。不無沽譽之意。此次出巡。出於自動。旣非奉行故事可比。易收當機立决之效。地方人士。久苦隔閡。無可告語。聞有存䘏之者。孰不致其翹企。夾道呼寃。攔輿陳詞。夫固有以兄輿情望治之殷迫矣。</p>
<p>或謂整飭吏治。非無常軌可循。懲戒失職。亦有專條可援韓氏升黜由已。舉措失準。縱能快意于一時。詎足埀法于將來。且司法尊嚴。貴能獨立。韓以省府主席。而逕　電文令知高法院長。撤調法官。尤有紊亂系統之嫌。爲此言者。自是崇尙法治之論。顧按諸實際情况。亦有不能不稍予變通者。吾儕小民無拳無勇。憔悴苛政之下。備嘗轢蹙之痛。旣非一朝一夕之故。亦豈一時一地爲然。如掖縣縣長之收受禮物。文登承審員之積壓案件。要爲其渺乎小焉者。外此凌迫之道。正復不少。遑論卵石不敵。徒事飲恨。就令衆怒所激。敢于一抗。而輾轉陳述。奔走呼籲。正不知何日方能達于監察者之視聽。即令已達于監院矣。而派員澈查。提案審覈。投遞往復。動稽時日。又不知何時方能移付懲戒。即令已付懲戒矣。而懲戒委員會之何日動議。何時可决。又淪于不可知之數。就令公道尙在人心。官官不盡相護。而一提到處分。或出於記過。出於削俸。充其極停職而止耳。被害人民敝神耗慮牽連奔波之結果。曾不足塞其望於萬一。由是而下民之氣益索。貪汚之膽益壯矣。故整飭以常軌言。將使公理無可彰之道。懲戒以專條言。轉令貪汚有彈冠之慶。懲戒云乎哉。整飭云乎哉。　　總之。在今百凡過渡之時。惟有實際設施。猶能稍饜民望。羣困待蘇。飢渴甚矣。官事以迂廻爲妍。法令等具文之瞻吾人尙復何所致其希冀。藉令在位者悟已往之非計。思祓濯於將來。就民生之立塲。謀斷然之處置。俾官邪得所匡正民氣藉以發紓。縱其所採步驟。未必盡恊法度。吾人略迹原情。不妨加以矜許。蔣委員長所謂深入民間切實求治者。扼要之言。可發深省。蓋救今之弊。惟能深入民間。方可切實求治。唯欲切實求治。必先深入民間。韓氏果能克踐此二語乎。將於此後之行動證之。</p>

<h3>電力工人怠工後昨午向工部局請願</h3>
<p>公司嚴拒工人進廠</p>
<p>黨政派員調查眞相</p>
<p>費信惇定明晨答覆</p>
<p>水電工會討論應付</p>
<p>國民社云、上海電力公司楊樹浦新廠、自前日無故開徐工人三名、及拒付養老金等、致激起千餘工人怠工、昨日下午、仍　續怠工、惟斐倫路老廠工人尙未參加、下午因星期六原係休息、中午全體工人至部局請願、結果、允明晨（星期一）答復、黨政特派員調查眞相、捕房戒備特别嚴密、茲將各情分誌於后、</p>
<h3>拒絕進出索養老金</h3>
<p>電力公司新廠工人、昨晨七時照例進廠、而公司事前已請有大批探捕密佈、並拒給牌子、以致千餘工人、不能進内、工人等認爲公司解除全體工人工作、乃結隊向寫字間交涉、於八時三十分、齊赴江西路南京路口電力公司總寫字間、索取養老金、並推出張長生等五人、要求面見總理愛爾特、然遭拒絕、工人見目的不達、齊集不散、公共租界捕房事前得報、因恐肇事、特派大批中西探捕蒞場監視、當工人結隊赴寫字間索養老金時、内有工人四名、坐脚踏車而來、因誤與人力車碰撞、該處探捕爲恐肇事、故借故拘入捕房、及至十一時三十分始行放出、</p>
<h3>全體向工部局請願</h3>
<p>昨午十一時、新廠全體工人約千餘名、自楊樹浦新廠出發、至四馬路工部局、擬向費信惇總董請願、到目的地已十二時、千餘工人卽環立於江西路局前、因人數衆多、對面美國敎堂　地内亦有不少工人、前往站駐、由工方推出張長生·朱阿福·朱浩森·包德福·四代表、進内求見總董費信惇、當由費總董會同會辦何德奎氏、親自接見、該代表卽陳述公司當局種種處置不當、無故開除工人等、請求援助、代爲交涉、結果、費氏允於昨日下午、前往該公司與總理愛爾特商洽、勸早解决、一面令工方嚴守秩序、於星期一上午九時、派代表到局、聽候答覆、於是工方始退、</p>
<h3>黨政調查工潮眞相</h3>
<p>社會局市黨部自前日下午、接受工方、請願呈文後、昨晨社會局卽派第三科朱金濤、會同市黨部所派戴咏蟾、出發調查工潮眞相、當先至江西路南京路口總公司、謁見總理愛爾特、探詢一切、繼又至天同路第四區電業工會方面、向常務詢問眞相、以便具報後、由黨政會商解决辦法、聞將定星期一進行調處云、</p>
<h3>組長會議老廠響應</h3>
<p>四區水電工會、以上海電力公司新廠解僱工人、復又拒付養老金、以致全體怠工、今又拒絕工人進廠、故定下午三時、在天同路會所、召開組長會議、討論應付辦法、聞老廠工人、如公司堅不令工人進廠出廠、亦將於星期一起而援助工人等决領退職金解散、</p>
<h3>公司通告一律解雇</h3>
<p>江西路南京路口上海電力公司邊門、昨晨貼通告、略謂、楊樹浦新廠已離職之工友、現定於十月三日在該廠牌子間發給工資、屆時前往領取可也云云、</p>
<h3>公司報告所持理由</h3>
<p>公司方面、昨爲工潮事、發出英文　文一紙與各報　聲明此　原因、星期五下午八時後、電燈廠工人、忽告罷工、事前並未有通知公司作任何磋商、公司方面、殊覺駭異、良以公司爲社會服務、責任綦重、極願與其職工磋商、惟事前旣未預聞任何要求、又未見工人聲請接洽、故至工人未罷工前、公司一無所知、其罷工目的何在、及工人何以出此下策也、公司認爲對於社會及工人責任良重、深切關懷、故勸諭工人等勿躁進罷工、而致危害無數倚靠電氣事業之工人生活、且此項未經若何手續、率爾罷工、公司　此舉爲工人昧於事理、對於公衆事業殊欠責任精神、而致有此不幸事件發生也、</p>
<h3>資方表示應付辦法</h3>
<p>昨日國民社記者、以電力工人罷工、關係重大、影響治安、因特訪該公司副總理愛爾特氏、訽以此次應付工潮方針、當承接見、詳告一切、據談、此次新廠工人突然罷工、公司頗爲詫異、蓋事前工方絕無通知、亦本派遣正式代表前往商酌、故公司方面、直不知其罷工理由、今日罷工人數、仍如昨日、計有新廠工人五百餘名、均屬銅匠修理等部、對於發電毫無影響、至公司　付辦法、現在接洽中、尙未確定、外傳公司改雇白俄工作、以代罷工工人、此實不確、惟白俄工人、本有少數在内、現罷工發生後、並未增加云、</p>
<h3>捕房戒備特别嚴密</h3>
<p>捕房方面、對此頗爲注意、除在楊樹浦新廠派駐大批武裝探捕約百餘人外、斐倫路老廠亦加緊防護、南京路公司寫字間、亦派有中西採捕十餘人、在前後邊門附近站崗保護、以防不測云、</p>
<h3>今日星期工人休息</h3>
<p>今日爲星期日、該公司寫字間及所屬新老各廠、均照例停止辦公、工人並不進廠、故對於工潮、今日必無發展、而事故亦不致發生、明日星期一、工部局向公司磋商結果、卽將答覆、如工方認爲圓滿、則工潮卽可解决、但萬一决烈、老廠恐亦將加入怠工、以資援助、至電力供給、據資方宣稱、絕無問題云云、</p>

<h3>全市男子單打網球王文正得錦標</h3>
<p>三比一勝余田光</p>
<p>女單打屬茅於文</p>
<p>二比零勝王大樂</p>
<p>全市運動會男女單打網球、昨日决　之結果、王文正膺男子冠軍、以三比　擊敗余田光、茅於文獲女子錦標、二比零全勝王大樂、今日因草地會公開雙打决賽之衝突、雙打未有比賽、决賽日期、大約在星期三下午、仍在哈同路中國體育會網球塲、昨男女决賽之經過、述之如次、</p>
<h3>王文正勝余田光　三比一</h3>
<p>王文正之勝余田光、余田光上場、聲勢煊赫、盛極一時、以六比二勝第一盤、豈知入後一蹶不振、不能復起、錦標遂决、比數如下、</p>
<p>二比六</p>
<p>六比○</p>
<p>王文正六比三　余田光</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>余田光先盛後衰　以第一盤之形勢萬不能預測全局結果之大變特變、余田光先開球、左右開弓、無往不利、擊法旣佳、錯誤又少、王文正竟毫無辦法、不料余田光若是之威風、不過曇花一現耳、第一發球局爲王文正所獲、余亦回破之、余再發球、拍下有力、球離手、人亦隨之前衝、上網壓殺、王文正望而束手、成二比一、王再發球、猛力深抽入兩角、成二比二、余並不稍挫、愈戰愈勇、王文正則尙未得其把握、球之出處、皆在綫外二三寸、於是一局復一局、王文正連失四局之多、余田光乃以六比二先勝第一盤、然而先盛後衰、竟接連失落三盤、亦意外也、</p>
<p>王文正勢如破竹　第一盤中之余田光、在第二盤、完全變態、頽廢不振、球連連出界、非出界卽入網内、第一盤中巧妙之網前壓殺、把握亦去、王文正一而再再而三、連勝六局、回敬一光盤、竟想不到、旣成各一、換新球更來、滿想余田光仍加振作、徒歸理想、余發球、有力而準備、一發而中、先勝一局、因王之出界、又勝一局、氣勢稍足、局面又非、錯誤百出、力亦大减、王文正乘此猛攻、連下五局、六比三再勝第三盤、以二比一佔先、最後一盤、已成弩末、余雖仍以二比一居前、王文正又下三關、成四比二之極對優勢、四比四余奪回二局、無濟於事、王文正以六比四完塲、王文正出球穏健、錯誤殊少宜乎勝也、</p>
<h3>茅於文勝王大樂　二比零</h3>
<p>女子决賽茅於文連勝王大樂二盤而解决、比數如下、</p>
<p>六比二</p>
<p>茅於文　　　王大樂</p>
<p>六比一</p>
<p>王全非茅之敵手、茅穏而純熟、正反俱佳、抽射、深遠、第一盤茅連下三局、王得一局、又成四比二、茅以六比二完第一盤、第二盤、更其不如、王僅勝第三局一局、六比一完結、</p>
<p>今日無比賽　今日全無比賽、因受公開雙打之影響、只得休息　天、南京業餘網球會余志忠來滬、已允將來全運時、假業餘網球會球場爲上海隊練習塲地、盛意殷殷、昨日男子雙打第一週結果、附錄於下、</p>

<h3>却令治盃第一戰東華勝西捕</h3>
<p>上午時一對一和局</p>
<p>結果東華二比一勝</p>
<p>本年東華西捕之却令治盃第一戰、昨在棒球塲舉行、天高氣爽、觀者倍極踴躍、看台四周、人山人海、熱鬧異常、觀衆之數、少言之、可一萬人、九十分鐘之相戰結果、東華二對一獲勝、</p>
<p>魁爾給奬了前事　却令治盃始於去年、東華兩戰兩勝、奪得該盃、給奬禮典、延未舉行、昨日又逢第二年開賽、戰前、西捕足球部長魁爾君、執燦爛奪目之銀盃、立諸兩隊選手之前、出其致誠之詞、親授銀盃於東華隊長陸鐘恩手中、陸答以謝辭、義簡而意重、第一年戰史、方告結束、而第二年開戰之笛聲、又聞於塲中矣、</p>
<p>東華威風仍如昔　東華表演、一若年之佳、前鋒脚頭上之小動作、靈巧可觀、兩翼頗多貫獻、中部射擊、惜未盡如人意、中衛綫三老將善於接濟、實力未見充足、意者尙未在適可狀態之中、李寗頗佳、而關洵安尤有顯著之進步、此東華當可引爲欣慰之一事、周賢言尙未操練就熟、由陸鐘思代庖、陸亦稱職、臨完塲時之俯身擒救底來一球、極受讚許、</p>
<p>勃拉特萊好身手　西捕老將軋許·派克·透納·未臨陣、實力如何、可想而知、中流抵柱、惟賴勃拉特萊之守門、其人負盛名於周賢言之前、因傷下野者數年、今者古調生彈、宛如往年威風、身高力壯、精明老練、非可輕視之、内衛未具特色、中衛綫之赫雷、服務盡職、韋思烏平平、前鋒與中綫時分兩片、中鋒威利、輔助不得其人、無用武之地、德飛尙可、傑克失望、兩翼令人喪氣、</p>
<p>笑容滿臉聞嘆聲　西捕開球、卽入東華脚下、李義臣一球右去、曹秋亭拍馬進陣、觀者精神奮發、頓見西捕危險萬狀、一再傳遞、將近腹地、李義臣正擬登關拔幟、誤觸手臂、被罰解圍、轉眼又來、陳家球掃球出諸敵後、萬象華李義臣逐影並進、内庭空虚、千鈞一髮、吉勃遜追至、阻止前進、如小萬早時射擊、或生異様結查、兩度良機、遂隨秋風西逝、意外危險、猝然起於門庭之左、當陸守門左擋右抵之間、引得滿塲采聲、乃以開球力弱、馮運佑又接濟失策、被敵　入、威利一脚、東華首告失守、觀者笑臉未收、嘆聲先來、</p>
<p>義臣一頂成和局　東華遭此打擊、全軍憤慨、五虎將分道進攻、馮吳屠中路策應、李關駐兵關中、遙加援助、盛聲之下、西捕大懼、韋思和束手無策、赫雷、法拉斯、相顧失色、幸而内衛尙堪一戰、累進累出、西捕處於因阨之中、力求生路不得、但以守門之健全、東華亦不易覓𨻶而入、韶光飛去、轉眼已過四十分鐘、馮運佑一球左飛、萬象華帶前深入、轉交塲中、李義臣迎面頂去、疾飛入網、上半時一對一、和局告成、</p>
<p>洪光從容立大功　易地再戰、重整旗鼓、東華聲勢喧赫、直使西捕望影而却、陳家球得曹秋亭之助、首先射擊、高未中的、曹繼續盤進、眼見陳洪光無人監視、乘𨻶傳去、陳對身空門、從容不迫、緩步進宮、東華二對一占先後此戰局、西捕如一盤散沙、任人攻擊、要非勃拉特萊手足穏健、目光鋭利、何致僅此微細差别之結果、迨至臨塲終了之際、西捕作最後之掙扎、乘人意倦興闌分路侵入、一時風雨滿城、草木皆兵、威利在人羣之中、攻陸下路、陸竟能俯伏擒出、攻守兩面、皆傑作也、大戰時間、由茲終了、東華二對一勝、裁判沈回春、</p>

<h3>逃</h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>個人，不論那一等，到了入世已深的時候，就算在恣威福，逞權力，似乎不可一世的做去。豈料這種境地，不是可以常久享着，儻若你！放出眞的眼光來一看，唉！實在像白雲蒼狗，變幻須臾，又像石火電光，一毫也把捉不住呢？拿近些講，從打倒滿清，建立民國以來，四川王人文，江蘇程雪樓，都是煊赫一時、而且手裡還握着兵權，總算不是碌碌無聞的一輩小官兒。到末了，也會得忽然澈悟起來，去修行，做和尙，再說陸微祥外交界上也不無微名，他在外國許久不回，後來也在歐洲投身修道院以自了。那末，可見得人世間的功名富貴，到底是可以擺脱的一件東西，不是罷不來的生命一般。從這一點去參個透，就可以明白許多爭權　利的在黑地裡做夢，眞是大可憐啊！</p>
<p>現在聽得孫傳芳，也由班禪介紹，在喇嘛前受戒，并在平中拜了洗月和尙爲師父，從此誦經拜佛，做一個空門弟子，這不是一件奇怪的事麽？孫傳芳以前曾經做過五省總司令，那部下的將領孟昭月周鳳岐盧香亭輩，没有一個不是暗鳴叱咤的戰將。咦！待到違背了趨勢，兵不用命的當兒，也就一敗如灰，你想！曾幾何時，這種風雲，不是像空中的浮塵，一刹那就已過去，要尋他往蹟，眞是影形全無，前人呌「不堪回首」，孫傳芳英雄末路，大約感到這種懺悔，所以有看破紅塵，出世去求安樂凈土，以度他的殘年歲月。從眼前煩刑蹟兵，民生遭難，有亂無治的時代，像孫傳芳頭腦中，還算尙有一點靈明，「放下屠刀，」立地成佛，正爲這一輩人說法！</p>
<p>但孫傳芳受戒去學佛，可算他是贖生前種種的罪孽，是他一己的事，不是他爲人的心。什麽意思呢？因爲菩薩的心腸，是救世的，不是厭世的。儻若旣經使盡權威，而到最後，大家以爲佛座前，可以作個藏身的地位，那末，　然高蹈，尙且不許，遁入空門，何嘗可對得一切衆生呢？故孫傳芳雖受了戒，「學佛」的資格，終還趕不上。只好算他是「逃禪。」况能否六根清凈，犧牲這一副混濁的軀壳，苦行窮修，吾恐不免憧憧不寗的心坎，有些難靠，看他自說，這一回剃度，因「心中無主宰，身家無倚恃」，照這様，實在是出於不得已，並不是出於信念。哈哈！我佛有知，不加以棒喝，豈不罪過多多麽？</p>
<h3>馬將和搶滿</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>馬將是從馬弔演變而來的，這句話胡適之早就說過。不過馬弔只有四十張，一文至九文，一千至九千，一萬至九萬，此外一張是零。馬將加至一百三十六張，愈多愈變化，所以馬將風行全球，馬弔歸於淘汰。</p>
<p>吳梅村有過「馬弔亡國論」，但楊光先却借作頌揚皇朝的資料。自然一方面說是亡國的工具，一方面說是興國的元勳了。九一八中國在哀悼，日本在慶祝。老天也凑趣，給中國第二次暴風雨，給日本以微晴。</p>
<p>明末一遺民撰謏聞隨筆，說：「葉子之戲，不知起自何時？荆溪當國，四友十亂之徒，忘寢廢飱，夜以斷日，名曰馬弔」。這情况和現在各地的馬將狂，相差不遠。倘然到上海各個大飯店裏去巡禮一下，或者「今人勝古人」呢。</p>
<p>楊光先的馬弔譜序說：「葉子之色用靑，靑者，清也。其勝采以紅印者，象今冠也。釆多者曰順風旗，符年號也。得勝日搶滿，滿人得勝之象也」。附會得像煞有介事，不能。不佩服楊老先生的聰明，而且頌揚得體。非但頌揚，並且還是預言，現在不是眞的在搶滿麽！日本人從中國人手裏搶了滿洲去還要假惺惺作態，放一個傀儡做擋箭牌，中國人固然痛心，傀儡何嘗不難過。不知道中國人可有搶還的日子？</p>
<p>有人說，馬將是明遺民所創，所謂「清一色」「拆韃子」等術語，都是咀咒清朝。恐怕這句話，還是從馬弔譜序上蛻化而來的。有了頌揚，也少不掉咀咒。可是我又要說他是預言了，清一色做不成，做了混一色罷，那個「僞滿洲國」，不是合中日滿爲一爐？至今說不出一個究竟的主權所有者來呢。</p>
<h3>蟋蟀跳到城隍廟</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>蟋蟀瞿瞿呌，寳寳心裏要；扳開磚頭剝篤「諧音」跳，跳到城隍廟，香爐蠟扦盡跌倒！」</p>
<p>這首童歌，不但通體童節非常和諧，而且末句一唱三歎，更加餘童繞梁，三日不絕。按這歌頗合於比興之旨，尋繹，其中大有至理存焉。如果仿照毛公序之詩之例來序它，則可得下列文句：「</p>
<p>刺貪也。人心貪鄙，利欲相逐，終不得安爾。」</p>
<p>姑取「奬券」一類的東西來說。這隻大「蟋蟀」，值到幾十萬元；想發財的「寳寳，」豈有不想倖得之理！「扳開磚頭」者，明知其不可必得而欲一試之也。「城隍」喻財星高照的人。然而「横財不富命窮人！」這位「城隍，」自得著了頭奬　後，惹得流氓拆梢，綁匪覬覦，「廟」中幾難安居。「香爐蠟扦盡跌倒」者，極言其不安也。</p>
<p>再把「皇后」一類的人物來說。這隻大「蟋蟀」，足使人「顚之倒之」的；患色情狂的「寳寳，」又豈有不想追求之理！「扳開磚頭」者，盡力跟蹝，一步不肯放鬆也。「城隍」喻情敵。然而美人畢竟是禍水！這位「城隍，」雖然情塲得意，可是弄得「廟」中鷄犬不寗，掃帚倒竪。「香爐蠟扦盡跌倒」者，亦極言其不安也。</p>
<p>推而廣之，想做官，想惜債，都可作如是觀！然則「蟋蟀」一日不絕，即「寳寳」的心一日不死；而「城隍」，而「城隍」的「廟」，遂永不得安矣，嗚呼！</p>
<h3>時來運來　俞友清</h3>
<p>我常聽見一句俗語；「時來運來，豆腐裏吃出肉來。」這句話的意思，應騐到現在吃香烟的同志了。我只記得香烟壳可以換香烟，或者換毛巾花露水等，想不到現在的香烟壳，變了銀行中的定期支票了。</p>
<p>譬如把紅獅牌香烟來說，十隻壳子，代價等於一萬塊錢，差不多一隻壳子，有一千塊錢的希望。若然你丢掉了一隻紅獅牌香烟壳，就是等於丢掉了一千塊錢的支票，以五分大洋的香烟，吃掉了烟，壳子還值一千塊錢，那末壳子的價值，重於香烟了，消耗五分大洋，就有一千塊錢的希望，這的代價，請算學生生來算，也不能得到相當的定例，這是很可驚人的一件事。</p>
<p>吃了别的香烟，有金的檳榔樹，有金的鼎，以及三大公司的禮券，放在我們眼前，多麽欣羨，若然你額角頭發亮，那末時來運來，平地一聲雷，可以做一個小富翁了，這是吸香烟同志的特别權利。你要發財，當然要加緊你的工作，就是增添吸香烟的量數，平日吸一匣的，那末至少要吸三四匣了。十年以後，做父母的人，都要敎自己的小孩，要有吸烟的技能，無論何地，都是烟霧横斜，烟氣迷漫的烟世界了，想不到鴉片風行一時以後，繼起者，其惟香烟乎？以後社會上看見不吸香烟的人，不是呆鳥，定是笨伯，難道發財都不想了嗎！我將「時來運來，豆腐裏吃出肉來」。改了下面一句。便成了「時來運來，香烟裏吃出鈔票來」了。哈哈！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福　　倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>凡靑年人看到新娘子，都是不免有一種欣悦的様子的。可是這時積之看到了新娘子，却好像是一枝利剪，對胸直穿了過來。當他這様走着𪳯了的時候，那位楊老太太江氏，早就看到了。恐怕會鬧出什麽笑話來，三脚兩步的，搶到了積之面前，就向他笑道：甘二爺你怎麽也知道了，今天是我們姑娘訂婚的日子。現在正要去照相啦。積之雖然是發楞，那也不過兩分鐘的功夫，這個時候，他就早醒悟過來了，若在許多人面前，發出呆様了，那豈不是一椿笑話？於是也就勉强撑出笑容來道：這可是巧啦，居然讓我趕上了喜酒了。趙自强也就早已看到了他，也搶上前兩步，和他握着手。積之搖撼着他的手道：趙連長，我還不曾來謝謝你呢，蒙你的介紹，給我找了那様一個有工可作，無氣可受的位置。今天我算來的巧，没有什麽可恭賀的，祝你們白頭到老罷。他口裏如此說着，眼睛已是遠遠的向桂枝的身上射了過去。桂枝雖然在大門裏面站着，他那一雙眼睛，又何嘗不是閃電似的，射到積之的身上。這時四目相射，桂枝另外嫁了一個人了，對於這位情塲失意者，自不無有些愧對的意思，所以他雖十分的鎭靜着，然而心裏頭一陣陣的熱氣，依然向臉上烘托出來，不由得他不把頭低了下去。趙自强對於積之和桂枝的以往關係，在理想上，多少是知道一點的，這時看着他那副勉强發笑的臉色，心中也很是恍然，便將另一隻手拍了積之的肩膀道：回頭我把事情辦完了，找個地方，咱們喝兩鐘。（二○二）</p>

<h3>兩個小朋友的作品</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>蟋蟀的鬥爭　時代的巨輪輾轉著。從那温和的春，轉到炎熱的夏，不知不覺的又轉到了凉爽的秋，終年的轉著，轉著，循環不息。</p>
<p>秋天來了。蟲世界的秋天來了，在這秋天裏，我們在晚上，總得聽見許多蟲的呌聲，好像在開一個很大的音樂會。在蟲類之中，有一種蟋蟀，他們没有羣衆性，而有一種互相殘殺的劣根性。</p>
<p>有一次，我看見一隻蟋蟀，住在一叢草堆裏，另一隻蟋蟀，走到這裏，尋食吃，那隻蟋蟀當他來搶他的屋子時，就爭鬥起來了。爭鬥的結果，兩隻蟋蟀都死了。他們旣是同類，何必如此决鬥而犧牲了兩條性命，眞是不值得啊！</p>
<p>我們人類把它們捉來放在蟋蟀缸裏，拿來做玩物，把兩隻蟋蟀，放在一缸中，引它們鬥。他們不知道人類的引誘，果然上了我們的當，爭鬥起來了。到後來，就是傷的傷，死的死。打勝了還要瞿瞿的呌，譏笑他的同類。這種蟲類，它們的程度低極了。但是可憐的中國，也是這様，自己和自己的人爭。年年不息，所以我們中國，要給外國欺侮而看不起我們。現在我們應當團結起來，盡力去抵抗外人，不要再自相殘殺了。</p>
<h3>一個有趣的回憶</h3>
<p>— 周玲</p>
<p>光陰如箭一般的過去，那酷熱的夏天已去了，凉爽的秋天又來了，現在，偶然回憶到在夏天某一個晚上做的一件有趣的事，把它寫在下面：</p>
<p>在火一般的太陽，漸漸地從西方落下去的時候，頓時大地上有些黑暗，但不一會月亮爍爍閃閃地出來了。並且它旁邊還有不可計算的一顆顆星兒，也跟隨着月亮出來，好像是在保護月亮似的。那月亮和衆星，把黑暗趕走了，發出皓潔的光明。並且天空藍的顔色，襯着銀白色的星，把這一天的晚上，點綴得更是光明而可愛了，使人們看見了，眼中都覺得非常明亮，更使人的心中也凉爽得很。所以在這時，許多男女小孩們，面上都現着笑容，出來乘凉，談談笑笑，都很快樂。</p>
<p>我的家庭，也是如此，吃了晚飯之後，都到花園中去乘凉，祖母和父母親也在走廊下乘凉，我和哥哥弟妹等，到亭子中坐下了，便開始講故事，說笑話，很是快活。而且這裏的風很大，因爲亭子旁邊，是許多高大而倒垂的柳樹，所以很是風凉。我們剛講完了一隻故事，休息一會，向外面望望晚景，正在瞭望中，有許多一亮一亮的東西在那裏飛，原來是無數的螢火蟲。我連忙喊弟弟看，弟弟看了，就說：「我們去拿扇子和瓶子，把它捉了，放在瓶中，很是好玩的。」我本來也歡喜螢火蟲的，聽了弟弟的話，很是贊成，就趕忙去拿了扇子和瓶子來，我們拍得很努力，不一會，已拍滿一瓶了。我和弟妹們，都快樂得跳起來，再想去拍，但已是十時了，就收拾了各種東西走到房中，關好電燈，把瓶子拿出來眞眞好看啊！原來瓶裏的螢火蟲，好像都變了許多小燈籠了。因爲這晚拍了許多螢火蟲，睡覺後，也同様的做了一個夢。</p>

<h3>月底兼逢週末銀洋收解反覺鬆懈</h3>
<p>昨日旣逢大月底、又爲星期六、銀行下午例假、故收解形勢比較平時雖忙、然遠不及從前月底比期之繁、市塲中洋拆仍爲九分、劃頭加水五六分、拆票交易、早市轉賬四百七十餘萬、新交易六七十萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易六十餘萬、洋押欵交易新做四十餘萬、取贖了結欵八九十萬、鈔票收回及發出一百七八十萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵銀一百六七十萬、洋二百十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵收解銀三百六十餘萬、洋四百四五十萬、特欵收解三百四十餘萬、結欵收解銀一百八十餘萬、洋二百七十餘萬、出倉銀五十萬、洋八十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百○數萬、特欵收解四百五十餘萬、結欵收解四百餘萬、各種貨匯税雜諸欵收解五百五六十萬、進倉五十萬、日商銀行收解結欵銀一百二十餘萬洋一百七十餘萬、進倉銀洋各五十萬、錢莊洋公單收解五千四百餘萬、因值月底而特多洋劃頭欵收解九百十餘萬、各路匯欵六十餘萬、解現二三十萬、</p>

<h3>一來洋拆之回顧</h3>
<p>九月份各業用途增繁、洋欵略有流暢可能、故洋拆市價似較前月升色、每日總有五六分行情、而從無白借市面、因之全月總計數頗有一元九角、以三十天扯計、每天得六分三厘三四之譜、與固定存息額二元相差微細、大約是項存息議决案、總在二元九五扣之間云、</p>
<h3>銀行聯合準備會修正票據交換章程</h3>
<p>上海市銀行業同業公會聯合準備委員會所創之票據交換所、自本年一月十日開辦以來、積極規劃、頗多設施、最初交換票據、限於三十二家交換銀行、旋各行本市分支店於三月間全體加入交換、由各行自行代理、共計有分支店五十七家、近來又有中滙勸工企業等三家銀行、商請加入爲交換銀行、聞已經該會通過、定於十月二日起開始加入交換票據、故現在加入交換之銀行、已由三十二家增爲三十五家、（交換銀行名單附後）連各行分支店在内、共有九十餘家銀行之多、查閲該會每月公布之交換統計、每日平均交換總數、票據約三千餘張、金額達七八百萬、此不過一部份金融業之收解集中、而成績已如上述、如果加入交換者增多、當更有美滿之結果、最近交換所爲發揮其功效、兼以應交換銀行外之銀錢業之需要、乃有擴充代理交換範圍之建議、日前該會舉行第九次委員銀行代表大會時、討論此事、僉以交換範圍亟應擴充、交換銀行除代理其分支店之外、應予其他各銀行信託公司及錢莊以同等之便利、當經决議將該會票據交換章程内代理交換一節、加以修正、一面减輕代理行之代理責任、一面增加代理交換範圍、此事關係本市全體金融業、茲經記者探得此項修正代理交換辦法内容、特將其要點分誌如左、</p>
<p>（一）代理範圍、（甲）交換銀行得受上海市各銀行各信託公司或上海市錢業公會各會員錢莊之委託、在聯合準備會代理交換票據、（乙）委託代理交換之銀行或信託公司或錢莊、（下稱委託銀行）以其總店營業滿二年以上者爲限、</p>
<p>（二）代理契約、委託銀行有遵守票據交換章程之義務、於代理開始前、應與代理銀行訂定契約（三）代理交換之票據、（甲）委託銀行收入可以交換之票據、均應送由代理銀行提出交換、（乙）前項票據、應於委託銀行原有背書戳記外、用代理兩行名義、加蓋交換戵記、</p>
<p>（四）代理交換差額之轉賬、委託銀行應在代理銀行開立往來户、爲收付委託交換差額之需、</p>
<p>此項修正章程、於十月一日起施行、按代理交搖制度、在英美及日本交換所行之已久、頗稱便利、蓋交換銀行入會手續較難、不若代理交換制度之簡而易行、且以各國銀行設立之多、若全體加入交換所爲會員、則交換手續紛繁、時間空開、均有難於安排之慮也、以上海銀行信託公司錢莊設立之衆多、習慣之複雜、欲全體金融業直接參加交換、其困難較之英美日本等國尤甚、則代理交換制度之需要、自不待言、今該會擴充代理辦法、一旦實現、行見全市銀錢業均將利用代理交換辦法、而收集中收解之便利矣、</p>

<p>清油產於有出桕油之區域。（桕油產地，已詳前八月三十日本報）其最大之用途，則在桐油價貴時，攙入其内因質色相似頗難分别產數年約三十餘萬擔。爲流質，貯器須用油簍或桶子，以防損漏云。</p>

<h3>蛇與Sphinx</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>兒時，外祖母常給講笑話，以及種種珍奇的事物，我最愛聽，至今記得的還很多。有一回</p>
<p>，她說有一種蛇，要吃人，但有個規矩，見了人，先把自己的身體直竪起來，同人身比較。　是人身不及牠那麽高，牠就吃；反之，人身高過牠的時候，牠就自己倒在地上，滾著死掉。所以，這種蛇對於小孩子是最危險的；不過也有克服牠的方法。就是當牠的身體尙未竪直時，你趕快拿一根竹竿或别的細長的東西，直舉起來，使竹竿的上端高於蛇頭，那麽，蛇也就認輸。</p>
<p>我的小小的心，曾經大受這話的刺激。後來到山野中去走的時候，常常一面惴惴，然一面很希望有這様的蛇出來，和我賭個高下·當然，一根柴棒·是常在手中緊揑着的。然而我在鄕下十來年，我的好奇心與冒險心，從未滿足過。</p>
<p>後來閲兩　秋雨盦隨筆，方知這種蛇的產地，原來在廣東瓊州，我不曾到過瓊州，難怪碰不着了。但隨筆所載，與外祖母所述，略有出入，據說：「此蛇於量入時，鳴聲曰：我高。人亦應聲曰：我高，蛇卽自墜而死。」則制勝更易，連竹竿柴棒之類也用不到了。</p>
<p>因這種蛇而聯想起的，是希臘傳說中的獅身人面的怪物·呌做Sphinx。這怪物，蟠踞在底比斯的大路上，說一個謎呌人猜，猜不着的，得讓牠吃；猜着了，牠自己投海而死。後來牠的謎底終於給歐迭潑王（Oedipe）猜着，原來是「人」。謎面是：「早晨四隻脚，中午兩隻脚，黄昏三隻脚，是什麽動物？」</p>
<p>無端同人比高下·無端把謎呌人猜·勝利了就吃·雖然不免覇道，但自己一輸也就把性命償付，毫不抵賴·實在可謂「直道而行」。想不到這類的怪物，倒是頗講信義的。</p>
<p>中國的傳說中，也有Sphinx似的東西，見山海經：「西北海之外，赤水之北，有章尾山：有神人面蛇身而赤，直目正乘，其瞑乃晦，其視乃明……是燭九陰，是謂燭龍。」又楚辭注：「天西北有幽冥無日之國，有龍銜燭而照之。」就是這東西，則這怪物乃是個光明使者。</p>
<p>爲人類詐僞黑暗所嚇怕之後，我很想與這些怪物爲伍了。</p>
<h3>禁用和自造</h3>
<p>— 孺牛</p>
<p>據報上說，因爲鉛筆和墨水筆進口之多，有些地方已在禁用，改用毛筆了。我們且不說飛機大砲都非國貨之類的迂談，單來說紙筆。</p>
<p>我們也不說寫大字，畫國畫的名人，單來說眞實的辦事者。在這類人，毛筆却是很不便利的。硯和墨可以不帶，改用墨汁罷，墨汁也何嘗有國貨。而且據我的經騐，墨汁也並非可以常用的東西，寫過幾千字，毛筆便被膠得不能施展。倘若安硯磨墨，展紙舐筆，則即以學生的抄講義而論，速度恐怕總要比用墨水筆减少三分之一，他只好不抄，或者要敎員講得慢，也就是大家的時間，被白費了三分之一了。</p>
<p>所謂「便利」，並不是偷懶，是說在同一時間内，可以由此做成較多的事情，這就是節省時間，也就是使一個人的有限的生命，更加有效，而也即等於延長了人的生命，古人說，「非人磨墨墨磨人」，就在悲憤人生之消磨於紙墨中，而墨水筆之製成，是正可以彌這缺憾的</p>
<p>但牠的存在，却必須在寳貴時間，寳貴生命的地方，中國不然，這當然不會是國貨。進出口貨，中國是有了賬簿的了，人民的數目却還没有一本賬簿。一個人的生養敎育，父母化去的是多少物力和氣力呢，而靑年男女，每每不知所終，誰也不加注意。區區時間，當然更不成什麽問題了，能活着弄弄毛筆，也許倒是幸福也難說。</p>
<p>和我們中國一様，一向用着毛筆的，還有一個日本。然而在日本，毛筆幾乎絕跡了，代用的是鉛筆和墨水筆，連用這筆的習字帖也很多。爲什麽呢，因爲這便利，省時間。然而他們不怕「漏巵」麽？不，他們自己來製造，而且還要運到中國來。</p>
<p>優良而非國貨的時候，中國禁用，日本倣造，這是兩國截然不同的地方。</p>
<h3>島國新秋</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>靑島印象之一</p>
<p>那兒，有淺藍的天，那兒，有深碧的海。那兒是大日耳曼帝國爲我們富宦巨商公子王孫所開闢下的桃源勝地！</p>
<p>夏天冉冉盡了，秋來了，海風是凉凉的。避署的人們像被窗前的冷月喚醒了枕畔的幽夢，心裏感着了一絲悵觸。好像覺得夏去得太快，海水浴還没有洗暢哩……</p>
<p>是的，那兒的夏天是值得留戀的。</p>
<p>灼熱的風吹不到島上，那兒没有熱汗淋漓的人。你愛看山？勞山離得不遠；你要玩水？　前就是一片靜蕩蕩的海。你要什麽都有：跳舞塲，電影院，咖啡店……一切近代都市人所需要享受的，都替你舒舒齊齊地打點好了。</p>
<p>没事時，坐着汽車去兜個風吧；馬路是整潔而且寛闊的，起伏着廻旋着跟着山勢的高下。每一條路的兩旁都是羅傘般密密的槐樹，在太陽光裏投下一帶綠蔭。可惜槐樹夏山不開花，要不然，滿街槐花的香風會撲入你的懷抱。</p>
<p>要散步一下嗎？海濱公園，第一公園，由你自己挑。那些公園就是爲一班少爺小姐造下的，一對對的摩登男女挽着臂散步，那兒頂合式，有錢避署的人是總少不了要帶個把異性的伴侶的。</p>
<p>吃過中飯睡一忽，就到匯泉海水浴塲去吧！</p>
<p>那兒的海水浴塲是全中國第一！那兒的海水不是黄濁的，是透明的藍的　片，遠遠地襯着抹雲山，當中點綴着赭色的礁石。沙灘是軟軟的，黄得像金子。人多極啦，男的，女的，浸過了水的黑髮，彩色的游泳衣，人魚般婉曲的身體：在浪花裏滾着，在沙灘上躺着；笑聲語聲隨時吐出來。没有族别，没有國别，雖然那兒異國的男女比自己的同胞還多，你一點也不會感得異様</p>
<p>就是這様在浪花裏浮眘，在沙灘上躺着，讓炎夏的白晝偷偷溜起。厭倦了，你可以向沙灘後面走去，那兒疏疏的綠樹林子當中有着茶座，進去喝一杯啤酒，喝一瓶勞山瀑水做成的可口可樂吧；無線電播送的西洋音樂在招誘着呢藍的天變成黑的天，藍的海變成黑的海。小靑島上的燈塔在黑暗裏明滅着：晚啦！</p>
<p>棧橋上這時候可熱鬧了。</p>
<p>棧橋：修築得那這整齊，長堤似的一直伸到海當中。橋下浪花老唱着神秘的歌。人在橋上，風在海上。散着步的男女，慢騰騰地顯着最悠閒不過的姿態。偶然有三兩個姐兒並肩笑語，一陣香風過去了，後面却有一二個哥兒追隨着指點評論，來這麽個長長千餘尺的FollowShot。愛呀，喜劇呀！錢是爸爸的，時間是自己的，年靑的哥兒不談戀愛還有誰配？</p>
<p>那兒有淺藍的天，那兒，有深碧的海。那兒是大日耳曼帝國爲我小富宦巨商公子王孫所開闢下桃源勝地！</p>
<p>那兒的夏天是值得依戀的。可是夏天冉冉盡了！</p>
<h3>袁中郎做官（一）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>讀完了袁中郎的尺牘四卷，覺得有一件事頗令人發噱，就是中郎的做官。他的尺牘，據江進之「解脱集」序言，是一一言一字，皆以所欲言，信筆直書，種種入妙」，而這些信，是一多者數百言，少者數十言，總之，自眞情實境流出。」這様的說明中郎，是很正確的。即以他的關於做官的書信而論，也就夠使讀者看到他是怎様天眞的隨時叙述自己的心理狀况。做官，在最初，是使他高興的；所以，當被任爲蘇州縣令的時候，他得意的了不得，忙寫信「給同社」諸君子說：</p>
<p>弟已令吳中矣。吳中得若令也，五湖有長，洞庭有君，酒有主人，茶有知己，生公說法，石有長老，但恐五百里糧長來唐突人耳。吏道縛人，未知向後景况若何。先此報知郎在這時候，眞有些得意忘形，因爲做官，對他是一個理想的幻境。「誰不樂作官」，「少時望官如望仙」，在他的信裏，他是一再言之。後來，這個夢是實現了，他做了吳縣的縣令了，而這一理想的仙境，也就由於這一番的做官完全打破。他說做官是一件苦事，受罪的事，痛心的事了。他認爲「職才識迂疏，終是林莽中人，責以民社，原非其任」（乞歸稿一）了，認爲「官實能害我性命」（與黄綺石）了，於是乎辭。在與李本建的信裏，他叙述自己這時對於做官的感想道：</p>
<p>少時望官如望仙，朝冰暮熱，想不知有無限光景。一朝到手，滋味乃反儉於書生。至於勞苦折辱，不啻百千倍之，奈何不令人摧撞息機也。辟如嬰兒，見蠟糖人啼哭不已，及一下口，唯恐唾之不盡。作官之味，亦若此耳。</p>
<p>這很可抵得一篇中郎做官的懺悔錄。他不想做官了，變「羨慕」而爲「憎惡」了，並且對於那些仍在做官的神仙中人，發着感慨。他寫信給徐少府說：</p>
<p>誰不樂作官，第有至情萬不得已者，雖爲亦無味矣。食無味，兒女子皆知吐之；官無味，而不知吐，必且嘔噦隨之，至於身命俱喪而後已，此不肖日夜所痛心者也。</p>
<p>没有做官的時候，中郎把做官的事看得快樂到極點，及至做了官了，他又覺得這檢直是人間地獄，還不如離開官位，做一個放浪的詩人。那裏知道，想得到官，固是不容易；想辭去官，也不是簡單的事。這從他給張幼于的信裏，可以看得出來。他說：</p>
<p>一處劇邑，如猢猻入籠中，欲出則被主人反扃，欲不出又非其性，東跳西𨁝�</p>
<p>中郎的辭官，實際上眞不是一件易事據尺牘，他是七辭而後被允許的。」去吳七牘」，全都附刊在尺牘後面。第一牘，他說明病，祖母要他回北方，他　已終是林莽中人，希望使他「得早還鄕里，雖死之日，猶生之年。」第二牘是進一步的發誓，說辭呈所說，「一字若欺，神明殛之。」第三牘，再要求，說若能允許他，那眞是「天高地厚，恩豈有極。」第四牘，是有些憤慨了，一面說，若許他辭官，那麽，「以後未死之身，皆台臺之賜」，一面是表示自己的决心說，「職寗抱頭逃遁，爲褫職之廢民，不願悴死他鄕，作無依之餒鬼」。第五牘，再進一步的說，「謹束裝維舟，以待台命。」第六牘，是下了最後的决心，準備逃走，他憤憤的說：</p>
<p>職已於本月十一日將妻孥行李，移至前塗，單身在宅，專候命下。不意遷延至今，消息全無。職心益鬱，職望轉孤，遂至火益加炎，寒熱復作。職此時如釜中之魚，欲活不能，欲死不可，展轉以思，惟有逃遁而走，可以保身全軀耳。台臺必欲使職爲棄印褫衣冠之廢人耶。</p>
<h3>熱情的小孩（四）</h3>
<p>— 哥茫與賽作鑄瑛譯</p>
<p>晚飯後，大家玩着古風的抽牌戲，白德小姐也以她那少女的風緻來從事這陳舊的玩意，於是喜得發抖的羅哲窺着牌從布袋裏出來，排列他的牌子、，帶着頑皮的神氣報說四　，帶着勝利的神氣報說五數！這比陪着他的祖母在一枝蠟燭的黄色亮光下玩那可憐的毫無生氣的牌，是怎様的相去天壤啊。「可是你們看他把我們的錢通搶去了，這騙子。」</p>
<p>他以一暼如火如荼的眼光，蓋住了白德的牌，彌補了疏漏的地方，結果，虧着他的力，她完全贏了：「這是一筆嫁　，」她一面把錢收集起來說，「這是你帮我賺的，羅哲，我們來分了罷。」</p>
<p>動身回家的時候到了；無論什麽勝會都有個收塲的。羅哲站起身來，非常悽惶，喉嚨裏像被一團東西塞住了，他把手伸她。卡湃爾夫人看着不忍說：「得啦，不要遲疑，抱吻她罷，你旣然這様渴望着。」她把孩子舉起放在桌子上，而那二十多歲的高大的少女便笑嘻嘻的把臉伸給他。於是一種未曾領略過的幸福，像一道曙光似的在他身上流過；他閉着眼睛，把他那灼熱的嘴唇靠近那比花還温柔的臉頰；一個從胸部湧起的充血消失在那朱紅的接吻裏；在那一秒鐘，他她像暈過去了。和這童貞的初戀的最完滿的幸福比較起來，一切詩人所說的話都顯得黯然無色。他往後給與别人的一切熱情的接吻，和這一吻比較起來，都祇是一種淡而無味的肉感。</p>
<p>十年後，他重又看見了她，那時她正是一個艶麗的少婦。他先以爲自己已經忘了她。可是十載光陰不能磨滅的回憶，像兒童時代的一道烟似的從他的心上溜過。他重想起在他嘴唇上的花一般的接吻。他把手拂着自己的眼睛，用力支持着，不讓自己倒下來……（完）</p>
<p>附註：這篇小說的作者哥茫（Jean　Gaument）與賽（Camille　Ce）是兩位生長在諾曼底（Normanoie）舊都洛安（Rouen）城的，大學出身的文人。　　雖然他們的命運狠蹇，一再因爲一兩票之差，失却取得龔古爾和巴爾扎克等文學奬金的光榮、但他們的作品其實多是非常叮誦的。他們最初　表短篇小說時，便因爲藝術的眞摯，和那種優美的情緒，鋭敏而又細緻的觀察，博得讀者的同情。</p>
<p>他們的作品裡，常是充滿着使人神往的鄕土的風趣，描寫外省人的生活，有許多地方是可以和巴爾扎克比擬的；但較之巴爾扎克，更多着一些可愛的温柔和憂鬱。</p>
<p>兩人的年紀現在都還不過五十左右，這在西洋人眼中，是還有着遠大的前途的。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Last night, more than 300 of Fang's troops in plainclothes attacked the defensive line of the Zheng regiment of the Luo Brigade of the 2nd Division at Da Xiaohongmen. Brigade Commander Luo ordered a main force to encircle the enemy. After a two-hour standoff, Fang's troops fled in disarray to their original defense. Brigade Commander Luo, considering the northern part of the Ming Tombs to be a neutral zone under the truce, did not pursue deeply. This morning, the two armies' sentries were about two li apart, and local battles occurred from time to time. The majority of Fang Ji's troops are still entrenched in the area around Changling, Tailing Garden, and the upper and lower gardens of Laojuntang near the Ming Tombs. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Nankou telegram: At 8:20 this morning, a Japanese reconnaissance plane flew to Nankou and circled for three weeks before dropping two heavy bombs on Taipingzhuang. Losses are unknown. Luo, brigade commander of the 2nd Division stationed in Nankou, ordered a curfew to begin early tonight. The railroad line is guarded by the 2nd armored railcar team. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) All Japanese troops from Niulanshan, Sishangcun, and Qiaozicun have retreated and gathered in Huairou County. There are no preparations to withdraw to Miyun. Japanese troops are requisitioning firewood and tea from the county governments of Huairou and Miyun counties. The county governments have established a firewood and tea office. Many residents of the city have moved to the surrounding villages. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the remnants of Fang Ji's troops retreated from Tangshan, most of them, except for those who fled along the way, followed Fang Ji and fled towards Erdaoguan, intending to retreat to Longguan and Chicheng to reorganize, hoping to wait for an opportunity to rise again. A small detachment that harassed the Thirteen Ming Tombs in Changping the night before is being encircled and suppressed by the National Army. It has not yet been completely eliminated. It is said that Fang Ji's ambition has not died, and he is plotting to collude with the so-called East Asia Allied Army scattered in Luandong and other places to disrupt the security of North China. The authorities have paid attention to this, but these elements are complex and their strength is limited, so they are not a cause for concern. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Changping telegram: About 500 to 600 remnants of Fang Ji's troops, after retreating from Da Xiaotangshan, turned and fled to the Ming Tombs and Da Xiaohongmen area in Changping County. They once harassed the south at dawn yesterday but were repelled by the garrison troops. They are now still entrenched near the Ming Tombs. Our army has deployed an extremely tight defense along the Ping-Sui Road, and it is determined that it will be difficult for the remnants of Fang Ji's troops to flee south. According to intelligence reports, after Fang Ji's failure to attack Gaoliying and Da Xiaotangshan, he originally planned to retreat to the Recha border, waiting for an opportunity to plot further disturbances. However, because his troops scattered along the way, and because winter was approaching, and it was difficult to obtain food and clothing in the north, he planned to take the opportunity to break through the Ping-Sui Line and flee southwest to Qinghe. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Changping telegram: Fang Ji's troops, who are entrenched in the mountainous area near the Ming Tombs, have been surrounded by the garrison troops. The two sides are currently in contact. This afternoon, a Japanese plane came to Changping County twice to conduct reconnaissance, and distributed many leaflets, the gist of which was to warn the remnants of Fang Ji's troops not to flee into the war zone again, otherwise they would be bombed. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) General Wan Xian's troops have deployed a tight defense along the Baxianzhuang, Tangya, and Ming Tombs area to block Fang's troops from fleeing south. Fang himself and Ji jointly fled north through Erdaoguan. There are still more than 1,000 remnants of Fang Ji's troops in the Ming Tombs area, and they have been surrounded in the Xiaohongmen area and will be resolved within days. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang have suffered repeated military setbacks and have telegraphed Liu Guitang and Tang Yulin in eastern Chahar, asking them to send troops south to try again. However, the situation is completely different, and Tang and Liu have likely refused them. Fang Ji, because he is still in the war zone and is still under pressure from the Japanese side, finds it difficult to gather his forces in the mountains. He plans to cross the Ping-Sui Railway west from north of Changping and then flee south again. However, the troops along the Ping-Sui Line are heavily guarded, and if it is difficult to cross, they will still head north into the Chicheng area of Chahar. Fang Ji's collusion with the bandits in eastern Ji is confirmed. Their original intention was to respond flexibly and drive towards Tianjin and Beiping in separate routes. Now that Fang Ji's forces are first in distress, the various bandit units in eastern Luandong are still being planned by Shi Yousan and others, who are hiding in a certain concession in Tianjin, to organize a large-scale East Asia Allied Army and disrupt the overall situation in North China under the cover of a certain force. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luo Qi, brigade commander of the Central Second Division, led his guards on the No. 3 armored railcar this afternoon to the front and inspected defenses at Qinglongqiao and Juyongguan, returning to Nankou that evening. If Fang Ji's troops break in, they will use all their strength to resolve the situation. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tangshan Telegram: The remnants of Fang Ji's troops will flee towards the deep mountains of Badaling. Today, Fang Ji's troops are collecting shoes, socks, and dry food from villagers in various villages of the Ming Tombs. There is no large force of Fang Ji's troops near Erdaoguan. This morning, the National Army clashed with two rear guard teams of Fang's troops near Shangcunying. In the Fenshuiling Heishanzhai area, there are more than 100 pseudo-soldiers of Fang's army being carried by local people to the northern mountains and forests of the Ming Tombs. (30th Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Enter Xinglong County</h3>
<p>Claiming the Purpose is to Protect the Qing Tombs</p>
<p>Security Team in the City Refuses Their Entry</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, a company of Japanese troops and a battalion of puppet infantry suddenly arrived in Xinglong County, claiming to protect the Qing Imperial Tombs. They then planned to enter Xinglong City to garrison, but were politely refused by our security team. They are now stationed about four li away from the city and there have been no unusual movements. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Qing Tombs near Xinglong were originally guarded by a company of security troops dispatched by the Hebei Provincial Government. When Zhang HaiPeng's puppet army battalion went to that area, they retreated without approaching upon seeing our police force. The battalion returned a few days ago, along with a regiment of Japanese troops. These hundred or so Japanese troops have arrived in Malanyu, and their purpose is unclear. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Light Machine Guns Replaced and Departed from Tianjin Yesterday</p>
<p>Turned Back Again by Japanese Troops at Lutai</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Bandits Have Infiltrated the Yiyuan Pass Area Again</p>
<p>Bandits in Luandong Form Four Armies</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The security team departed from eastern Tianjin for the second time on the morning of the 30th, but was blocked by Japanese soldiers at Lutai and Tangshan, and retreated back to Xinhe and Junliangcheng to await orders. Liu Xingpei, the magistrate of Funing County, and Secretary Wang passed through Tianjin and went to Beiping on the evening of the 30th to seek instructions. Zhou Yuying, the captain of the team, came to Tianjin to seek instructions. It is reported that Yin Tong and Chai Shan will go to Shanhaiguan within days to negotiate with the Japanese side. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to sources in the transportation sector, the bandits in Luandong have formed four armies, with divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions established under them. Many plainclothes bandits are lurking in various places, attempting to launch a large-scale attack. If our security team cannot enter on the 2nd, the bandit disaster in Luandong will expand even further. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The security team that was heading to Luandong to suppress bandits, after being blocked and turning back, replaced their light machine guns, passed through Tianjin at 2:30 a.m. on the 30th to replenish rice, flour, and supplies, and departed east from Tangshan at 2:00 p.m., scheduled to arrive in Changli on the night of the 30th and begin a vigorous suppression of the bandit lairs on the morning of the 1st. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shi Yousan secretly established an office for the East Asia Allied United Army in the Japanese concession and used his private funds to buy off hoodlums and bandits in an attempt to disrupt the local authorities, who have paid close attention. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 29th, the Hebei Provincial Government transferred an additional 1,500 security troops to the Luandong war zone to suppress bandits. However, when they arrived in Luanzhou, they were suddenly blocked by Captain Matsuda of the Japanese garrison troops on the Beining Line, who said that our security team was carrying heavy military equipment and could not pass, forcing them to return. Captain Wang of the security team negotiated on the spot but to no avail, and had to return to Shantanggu to await orders. On one hand, the reception committee telegraphed Yin Tong to negotiate with the Japanese military officer Chai Shan, explaining that the machine guns and mortars carried by the security team were not heavy military equipment, and that if they were not allowed to carry them, the bandits in Luandong could not be suppressed. Chai Shan telegraphed Nakamura to explain, asking him to inform Matsuda. It is reported that a reply was received on the evening of the 29th, agreeing to handle the matter with discretion, and the security team could continue to depart at 10:00 a.m. on the 30th without any problems. After arriving, they will begin to suppress the bandits. Lao Haozi's troops are still based in Funing and have not advanced to harass Changli. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Changli: After the security reinforcement team was blocked, they are now concentrated in Lutai. Yin Tong passed through Changli and went to Shanhaiguan at noon on the 30th to meet Suzuki to discuss the matter of the security team going east. It is said that the content was satisfactory and they can come to Changli within days. Bandits once infiltrated Changli on the night of the 39th [likely a typo, should be 29th or 30th] and extorted money in Qiaofu Mountain, but were repelled by us. There are now more than 150 bandits in the Balizhuang area, more than eight li away from Changli. Our security team is prepared to prevent them from infiltrating Changli. A certain party's seven large trucks carrying supplies to the bandits in the Shanhaiguan area were mistakenly fired upon by the bandits, believing them to be our security team. The certain party also returned fire, and the supply trucks then diverted to Taitouying, distributing all the guns and ammunition to the bandits there. According to reconnaissance reports, more than a thousand bandits have infiltrated the Yiyuan Pass area again, attempting to link up with Lao Haozi. Lao Haozi has returned to Qinhuangdao and is commanding the bandits with Qi Wenping. Guo Yazhou is commanding Shanhaiguan. Lao Haozi's troops are based in Taitouying. They are all part of the East Asia Allied United Army, with Shi Yousan as the commander-in-chief and Qi Wenping as the commander-in-chief of the first route. The cities and villages of Funing have long been emptied of residents and merchants after being cruelly looted by the bandits. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Tianjin Rent Land to Build an Airfield</h3>
<p>Area Can Accommodate More Than a Thousand Aircraft</p>
<p>Xu Shoulin and Yang Zhixiang Collude with the Japanese</p>
<p>Unauthorized Lease of Guangren Shantang Property</p>
<p>The Shantang is Preparing to Negotiate According to Law</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Guangren Shantang owns more than 90 qing of land in Wangdingdi, Nankai, with annual rent of more than 10,000 yuan. Xu Shoulin contracted it. Xu and Yang Zhixiang are close friends. Yang once served as a comprador for the Japanese merchant Okura &amp; Co. and has many connections with the Japanese. Between June and July of this year, they secretly discussed circling ten qing and fifty mu of land and renting it to the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin at a high price to build an airfield. To avoid outside attention, Yang rented the land under his name. The Japanese side has hired workers to build the airfield, and the area can accommodate more than 1,000 aircraft. From now on, the Japanese air force will have another air base, and their ambition to covet North China will become more apparent. The Guangren Shantang has warned Yang in a letter because of property rights issues and because Yang leased the land to foreigners without authorization, and is preparing to resolve the matter according to law. The authorities have not yet made any statement on this matter. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Discusses Opinions on Mongolian Autonomy</h3>
<p>Decided to Draft a Memorandum to the Central Government for Adoption</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission convened its 156th regular meeting on the morning of the 30th, attended by more than ten people including Shi Qingyang, Gesang Zeren, Tang Kesan, and Chen Bingwen, to discuss opinions on Mongolian autonomy. As a result, it was decided to draft a memorandum to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Central Government for adoption and implementation. The gist of the memorandum is that if Mongolia does not violate the intentions of the Central Government and the current system, it seems permissible to allow it to handle local autonomy under the guidance of the Central Government. It is also proposed that the Commission or the Central Government organize an agency at an appropriate location in Mongolia to handle guidance and assistance matters and communicate information between the local and central governments. The above memorandum has been drafted and is expected to be sent out tomorrow. (30th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Fails to Resolve Sino-Japanese Dispute</h3>
<p>Irish Representative Advocates for Remediation</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representative of the Irish Free State, Walsh, gave a speech at the League of Nations Assembly today, saying that the responsibility for the failure of the League of Nations to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, the economic conference, and the disarmament conference should be borne equally by the major powers. This is not a breakdown of the machinery, but a failure to use the machinery of the League of Nations. He also asked the representatives to pay attention to the fact that armaments have increased rather than decreased, and that the world's powers are fanatically preparing for chemical warfare, the horror and inhumanity of which will be unprecedented. We must all recognize the seriousness of the situation. When commenting on the Sino-Japanese dispute, he stated that the shortcomings in the League of Nations Covenant and other peace instruments must be remedied. He asked what extent the recommendations and resolutions of the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Assembly have had any effect. He also said that we should deal with the difficulties of the League of Nations with frankness and without fear, otherwise we will only create a situation of international chaos.

<h3>China's Ineffective Anti-Smoking Efforts</h3>
<p>Many Reasons, Complex Relationships</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Sixth Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council continued to discuss the report of the Central Opium Management Committee here today. The Chinese representative, Dr. Hu Shih-tse, said that the British representative mentioned that those who manufactured poisons in Tianjin were not severely punished, but did not mention that the main culprit in manufacturing poisons was a Japanese, who has not yet been arrested. The five Chinese who were detained were only accomplices, so the punishment was slightly lighter. In general, the Chinese authorities severely punish those who manufacture or traffic in poisons, and in several provinces, offenders are beheaded. The British representative referred to by Dr. Hu was the British Foreign Secretary Simon, who protested on September 28th against the statement in the report that difficulties were exacerbated by the existence of concessions and settlements, where those who manufacture poisons operate and Chinese police are unable to intervene. He said that the police of the British concession in Tianjin arrested five Chinese who manufactured poisons and handed them over to the Chinese police station. He heard that the leader of the five paid a small fine and was released. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, during a discussion on the opium issue at the League of Nations Narcotics Committee, the Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, and the British representative, Ms. Houlsworth, debated each other. Ms. Houlsworth repeatedly advocated for an investigation into the state of narcotics sales in China. Ms. Houlsworth asked the committee to pay attention to the annual report sent by the British concession authorities in Tianjin to the Advisory Committee. Ms. Houlsworth meant that the Chinese authorities should cooperate closely with the concession authorities. The Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, replied that the Chinese authorities are not fully informed of the matters done by the concession authorities, and that the matter involves the issue of concessions and extraterritoriality, which is quite complex, and that the countries concerned should cooperate earnestly. In fact, the report submitted by the Shanghai International Settlement is sufficient to prove that Chinese courts impose extremely severe penalties on private traffickers. Hu cited several examples to support this. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Discusses German Anti-Jewish Issue</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Although Germany opposed it behind the scenes, the Dutch Foreign Minister ultimately brought up a motion in the League of Nations, advocating that a considerable amount of money be allocated to thoroughly study the economic, financial, and legal status of German refugees. The Dutch Foreign Minister, Greife, stated that the motion does not involve German internal affairs or investigate the reasons for the refugees' emigration, but that the influx of a large number of refugees into other countries is sufficient to disrupt the economic organization of other countries, so the League of Nations needs to take action. The resolution has not yet been voted on. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Rajchman Passes Through Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Dr. Rajchman, a technical advisor to the Chinese government appointed by the League of Nations, is traveling to China from Europe on the Italian ship Conte Rosso. He arrived in Hong Kong this morning. A Reuters reporter interviewed him and said that his appointment was because China has been cooperating with the League of Nations since 1929 regarding its construction and technical development. Currently, there are several League of Nations experts assisting China in public health, roads, construction, water conservancy, agriculture, and civil administration. The Chinese government now believes that it is appropriate to invite the League of Nations to send a technician to China to assist the work of the experts and to act as a liaison between the National Economic Council of China and the technical organizations of the League of Nations. The reporter then inquired about the political activities of the League of Nations. The doctor replied that he does not ask about politics, but specializes in technical matters. The doctor also declined to comment on Japan or his position as an advisor to the Chinese government. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Counter-Accuses Us of Violating the Ceasefire Agreement</h3>
<p>Kwantung Army Headquarters Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Changchun) The joint army of Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, etc., which invaded the demilitarized zone, has been defeated. A part of the Japanese troops in Shunyi withdrew to their original station. Today, the Kwantung Army Headquarters issued the following statement: "Recently, Fang Zhenwu's army invaded the Huairou area, and Yu Xuezhong's army invaded the Luandong area. These are actions that disregard the ceasefire agreement and cannot be tolerated. Therefore, we demand the withdrawal of both and have had to prepare for some military action. This is a fair action based on the ceasefire agreement. If they withdraw outside the agreement line, it goes without saying that the Japanese army will immediately return to its original state."

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Deep into the People　City</h3>
<p>Han Fuqu, the chairman of Shandong Province, recently toured various counties in Jiaodong. Reports indicate that in addition to inspecting teams and overseeing administration, he also showed concern for the people's suffering and was determined to rectify injustices. He convened gatherings of the populace wherever he went, personally engaging with them. For any public officials found guilty of dereliction of duty or harming the people, he did not hesitate to use severe measures, promptly determining their demotion or dismissal. For example, Yu Baodong, the magistrate of Qixia County, was removed from office for negligence; prison guards were punished for mistreating prisoners; a judge in Wendeng was dismissed for having too many pending cases; the magistrate of Ye County was demoted for accepting gifts; and employees of the Yanwei Railway were executed by firing squad for raping a woman. This was a cathartic way to sweep away the long-standing bad habit of officials in the arena equivocating and being complacent. Han, as a military man overseeing provincial affairs, may have had some intention of gaining fame through his efforts. This tour was self-initiated and not comparable to simply carrying out routine duties, making it easier to achieve decisive results. The local people have long suffered from being isolated and having no one to whom they could voice their grievances. Those who felt sympathy for them were looking forward to this. People blocked the road with their carriages to plead their cases. It can be said that the people's desire for good governance is pressing.</p>
<p>Some argue that there are established procedures for rectifying officialdom, and specific articles to invoke for punishing dereliction of duty. Han's promotions and demotions are based solely on his own discretion, and his actions lack precision. Even if he can find temporary satisfaction, it is not enough to establish a lasting standard. Furthermore, the dignity of the judiciary should be independent. Han, as the chairman of the provincial government, directly telegraphed the president of the High Court, ordering the removal and transfer of judges, which is suspected of disrupting the system. Those who say this naturally advocate the rule of law. However, considering the actual situation, some flexibility is necessary. We ordinary people have no power or strength and have suffered greatly under harsh government. This has not been the case for only a day or two, nor is it limited to one place. The acceptance of gifts by the magistrate of Ye County and the backlog of cases by the judge in Wendeng are minor matters. In addition, there are many other ways to oppress the people. Let alone the fact that the people are no match for the officials, and they can only swallow their anger. Even if the public is outraged and dares to resist, their petitions and appeals will not reach the ears of the supervisors. Even if they reach the supervisors, the investigation and review process will take time. By the time it is referred to the disciplinary committee, it is unknown when the committee will deliberate and decide. Even if justice prevails and officials do not protect each other, the most that can be done is to record a demerit, deduct salary, or at most suspend the official from duty. The result of the victimized people's mental and physical exhaustion and involvement in the case is not even enough to satisfy one ten-thousandth of their wishes. As a result, the people's spirit diminishes, and the officials' boldness to be corrupt grows. Therefore, if we talk about rectification using established procedures, we will make it impossible for justice to be revealed. If we talk about punishment using specific articles, we will only give corrupt officials a reason to celebrate. Is this what we call punishment? Is this what we call rectification? In short, in this time of transition, only practical measures can slightly satisfy the people's expectations. The people are in great distress and eagerly await relief. They are extremely hungry and thirsty. If official matters are handled in a roundabout way and laws are treated as mere formalities, what hope can we have? It is hoped that those in power will realize that their past actions were ill-conceived and resolve to cleanse themselves in the future. They should stand on the people's side and make decisive decisions so that corrupt officials can be brought to justice and the people's morale can be boosted. Even if the steps they take are not entirely in accordance with the law, we may give them some praise, understanding the circumstances and motives. Chiang Kai-shek's words about going deep into the people and earnestly seeking governance are essential and thought-provoking. To remedy the current ills, we must go deep into the people to earnestly seek governance. To earnestly seek governance, we must first go deep into the people. Can Han truly put these two phrases into practice? His future actions will prove it.</p>
<h3>Puyi Stole Treasures, Temporarily Unable to Redeem</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Heng, director of the Palace Museum, spoke about Puyi's theft of relics from the Palace Museum. This lasted for a long time. It was during his marriage when he was short of funds, so he pawned the golden marriage certificates of the empresses of past dynasties (ordinary people's marriage certificates were made of paper, while the Qing emperors' and empresses' marriage certificates were made of gold), as well as pure gold treasures, to the Salt Industry Bank. The term has now expired, and the principal and interest are estimated to be about 2.2 million yuan. However, these golden marriage certificates and other treasures have no important value in our country's literature and history. Moreover, it is difficult for the Palace Museum to raise funds, so there is currently no way to redeem them. Ma also said that before the fall of Rehe, the Peking Library sent personnel to collect and transport the Rehe Tibetan scriptures back to within the pass. However, at that time, Tang Yulin regarded them as his private property and refused to let them go, so they were swept away by the Japanese. This is very regrettable. The calligraphy and paintings from the Palace Museum that Zhang Xueliang borrowed have now been completely returned. As for the establishment of a branch of the Palace Museum in Nanjing in addition to those in Peking and Shanghai, this will be decided after the board meeting of the Palace Museum.

<h3>Foreign Ministry Protests German Newspaper Fabrications</h3>
<p>Newspaper Claims Rumors Are False</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A German newspaper published an article on May 19 entitled "Record of Refugees in Peking, the Ancient City of the Yellow Race," which described the famine in Peiping, with old and young eating each other and the buying and selling of human flesh, which was completely fabricated and openly insulting to our country.

<h3>U.S. Navy Department Plans Naval Construction Program for 1928</h3>
<p>London Treaty May Not Be Revised After Expiration</p>
<p>Chief of Naval Operations Inspects Naval Base</p>
<p>Hunterson Transport Ship</p>
<p>It has been reliably learned from the Hunterson transport ship that the U.S. Navy Department has planned a naval construction program for 1928, hoping to maintain the naval strength at the level stipulated by the London Treaty. This plan will be submitted to Congress in early January next year. It is also heard that people in the U.S. government anticipate that the provisions of the London Treaty may not be revised after 1936. Naval personnel also believe that the current provisions in the treaty are still satisfactory for maintaining an effective navy. Therefore, it is expected that these provisions will remain in place for several years unless a new treaty is renewed and changed. According to the new plan, 96,160,000 yuan will be allocated for naval construction each year for the first six years, so that the strength stipulated by the treaty can be met by 1939. After that, new ships will be built and old ships will be replaced on time. According to the London Treaty, the United States may have 375 warships, including 20 battleships, 8 aircraft carriers, 22 large cruisers, 25 light cruisers, 201 destroyers, and 19 submarines. This strength will be maintained in the future. The first batch of new ships in the new plan will be built in 1935. Naval personnel claim that this plan is not intended to cause a naval arms race, because the London Treaty has stipulated a limit, and this limit should be reached and the stipulated strength should be maintained.

<p>Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>The Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Honolulu received a radio report from the cruiser Indianapolis this afternoon that U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Swanson, who is inspecting the naval base on board the ship, will arrive in Honolulu tomorrow. (28th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Swanson will arrive in Honolulu tomorrow. The disclosure of the naval construction plan for 1928 has made Americans and people from other countries pay more attention to the U.S. Pacific problem, naval policy, arms reduction, and the status of the Philippine Islands. Although the Navy Department claims that Swanson's trip to Honolulu is a routine inspection of the naval base, outside observers do not believe that it is limited to inspection. They often connect it with all Pacific problems. The most obvious is the political status of Honolulu, because the governor of the island is still a Republican. After the Lansing Bill failed in Congress, President Roosevelt indicated that he would appoint a new governor after experts investigated all aspects of the Honolulu government. Therefore, some parties believe that Swanson's trip to Honolulu is also tasked with an investigation mission. Furthermore, since Swanson's trip is for the purpose of consolidating the island's naval base, its impact will naturally be noticed by international people, because this type of project will definitely cause a reaction from Japan. Furthermore, what Swanson decides on this trip may also have a significant impact on the naval arms reduction conference to be reconvened in 1935. (29th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Indian Representative Believes Self-Defense Has No Good Method Other Than Increasing Taxes</p>
<p>Negotiations on the Continuation of the Japan-India Treaty Are Underway</p>
<p>Shimla</p>
<p>As a result of the meeting between Japanese Plenipotentiary Sawada and Indian Representative Keidan today, it was learned that India consistently refuses Japan's demands on the grounds that self-defense of Indian industries requires raising tariffs. As a result, Sawada immediately convened a joint meeting of government representatives and civilian advisors to discuss the countermeasures that Japan should take. The future of the meeting is not optimistic. (29th Electrical Communications Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the continuation of the Japan-India Trade Treaty, which will expire on October 10, are currently underway between Ambassador Matsudaira to the United Kingdom and the British government. According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the British side's intentions are generally as follows: (1) The current Japan-India Treaty will be unconditionally continued for one month. (1) If a new treaty agreement can be reached in the Shimla negotiations by November 10, the current treaty will be repealed. (1) If a new treaty cannot be reached, the current treaty will be extended with appropriate conditions for a period of time thereafter. The above conditions are based on the various provisions agreed upon in the Shimla negotiations up to November 10. The so-called appropriate period is not as long as the Japanese side hopes. Its conditions, in addition to the tariff rates agreed upon in Shimla, may not be beneficial to Japan. Therefore, as a result of being bound by conditions, the new treaty will inevitably be affected in the future. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it cannot simply agree to this notification from the United Kingdom. (30th Electrical Communications Dispatch)</p>

In addition, Duriye, representing the French Economic Development Corporation, is also traveling in Manchuria. His opinion is the same as Marcel's, saying that although Manchuria is a rich land, it has not yet reached the point where it can accept foreign investment. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Havana</p>
<p>Today, tens of thousands of civilians marched in the main streets of the city. The military opened fire on the crowds at this time. The marching civilians were dispersed by the military in front of the "Anti-Imperialist United Association" venue. The military first ordered the crowds to disperse, but the crowds refused, so the military opened fire on the civilians continuously. Cavalry and infantry attacked the "Anti-Imperialist United Association" venue, and the venue was occupied by force in less than five minutes. When the military fired the first volley of shots, six people fell dead from the bullets, and twenty-five people were injured. Three people were shot dead by machine guns. Gunshots rang out for three hours near the Sacred Heart Church and the public house. The military opened fire on the roofs, because many Communist sharpshooters were on them. As of now, one captain and four soldiers have been killed in the park. At night, thousands of soldiers exchanged gunfire with Communists in the streets. According to a certain source, the chaos was caused by the Communists seeing soldiers installing machine guns in front of the "Anti-Imperialist United Association" venue, which led to the conflict.

The French lottery is expected to collect 100 million francs, 60% of which will be used as prizes, and the rest will be used to increase revenue.</p>
<p>Japan's Conspiracy to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<h3>Russia Warns Japan to Prepare to Publish Documents</h3>
<p>So That the Truth Will Be Revealed to the World</p>
<p>Detention of Railway Personnel Is Only a Preliminary Action</p>
<p>Japan Should Be Responsible for the Breakdown of Railway Purchase Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that on the 28th, Russian Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota. The Russian ambassador conveyed the Russian government's warning to Japan, stating that the Japanese Kwantung Army and Japanese officials in Manchuria were cooperating to conspire against Russia, and that the border guard team was abusing its power to arrest Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway in order to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. If Japan and the puppet regime do not stop their conspiracy, the Russian government plans to announce the whole story of the Japanese military's conspiracy to the world. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Russian side's warning has a threatening nature and is a major expression of the Russian side. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will deal with it seriously. (30th China United News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) In a new memorandum presented by Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on September 28, it was stated that the documents currently held by the Soviet government have proven without a doubt the leading role played by the Japanese garrison in Harbin in preparing to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, and that the arrest of Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway is the first step in this work.</p>
<h3>Illegal Arrests Violate Russian Rights and Interests</h3>
<p>On the 28th of this month, Yurenev visited Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, and he, representing the Soviet government, made the following statement: "On September 24, Japanese and 'Manchukuo' police officers in Harbin arrested Galena, director of the business department of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Gubri, director of the accounting department, Lavrov, manager of the main machinery factory, and Special Commissioner Abelev. On the same day, Japanese officers of the Manchurian border guard team arrested Avramenko, the station chief of the station. At the same time, Katier, the station chief of Suifenhe Station, was also arrested by the officers of the Manchurian border guard team. These actions by the Harbin police and the Japanese-Manchu border guards are illegal and violent interference in the legitimate administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and clearly show that they are infringing on the Soviet Union's rights in the Chinese Eastern Railway, and at the same time, they undoubtedly conflict with the existing agreement on the railway.</p>
<h3>Puppet State's Actions Controlled by Japan</h3>
<p>The Japanese government was notified a few days ago by Sokolnikov's statement to Ota in Moscow and Yurenev's statement in Tokyo that these illegal steps were being planned by the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' authorities. In addition to these statements, the Soviet Union will inform the Japanese government that, according to the accurate and unswerving materials currently held by the Soviet government, these actions are only the first step in implementing the plan, and this plan was drawn up in detail at the various meetings held by the Japanese garrison and is being implemented step by step in Harbin. Participants in these meetings include the highest-ranking Japanese officials responsible in the "Manchukuo" government.</p>
<h3>Documents Will Be Published When Necessary</h3>
<p>If necessary, the Soviet government will publish all of these documents in order to make known the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria and the methods of Japanese administration in Manchuria. In the above statement to the Japanese government, the Soviet government issued the following warning: "The Japanese government shall be fully responsible for the implementation of the plan to seize the Soviet Union's rights in the Chinese Eastern Railway." The Soviet government also solemnly declared that the meetings to sign the plan to occupy the railway were held by the Japanese garrison, and that Japanese border guards and police officers participated in the arrest of Soviet employees.</p>
<h3>Japan Fully Responsible for Breakdown of Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Soviet government believes that these actions by the Japanese authorities regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway are merely to promote the breakdown of the ongoing negotiations to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Japanese government shall bear full responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom. (29th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Arrest of Russian Personnel Initiated by Ohashi</h3>
<p>Boli</p>
<p>According to the news received here from Boli, it is known in Harbin that the start of the Japanese-Manchu authorities' seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway was initiated by Mr. Ohashi, the chairman of the "Manchukuo" delegation to the Tokyo negotiations. After the Manchurian delegation refused to change its opinion on the original price of buying the Chinese Eastern Railway and notified the Soviet delegation, on August 25, he issued an order to the "Manchukuo" side to prepare to arrest Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway and implement the plan to seize the railway. This news was of course not expected to be leaked by Ohashi. The provocative nature of this tactic by the "Manchukuo" representative can be said to be unprecedented. (29th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fascist Faction in Japan Plots to Overthrow Makino's Administration</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) On the morning of September 24th, at 9:00 AM, a group of Japanese fascists in Tokyo drove around Marunouchi, distributing leaflets. The content of the leaflets included: "(1) Oh, Japanese citizens! Recognize this photograph, this is the public enemy of the Japanese people, Count Nobuaki Makino, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, who is violating the prerogative of supreme command and bringing disaster to the country and the people." The leaflets featured a six-inch photograph of Makino. In front of the Imperial Theater, there was a temporary disruption of order due to the scramble to see the leaflets. The perpetrators have not yet been apprehended. It is said that this is the work of the fascist faction's movement to overthrow Makino. (China United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The defendants in the May 15th Incident, from both the Army and Navy, bitterly condemned the crimes of the political parties, accusing them of colluding with financial cliques, caring only for their own interests, and disregarding the nation's peril. Furthermore, regarding the London Naval Treaty, the defendants and their lawyers all criticized the politicians for infringing upon the Emperor's supreme command and causing deficiencies in national defense. Although the Seiyukai has historically adopted a passive attitude towards the military and made every effort to accommodate the warlords, this case has had a significant impact on the public. The public is gradually rejecting political parties and supporting warlords. Moreover, there are undercurrents in the recent political situation in Japan. The Saitō Cabinet may resign en masse before the opening of the December Diet session. Therefore, it intends to actively work on the public's perception, and starting tomorrow, it will mobilize all party members to give speeches across the country, advocating constitutional politics as the right path and condemning dictatorial politics as the evil path, and has resolved to declare war on the Fascists.

<h3>US Labor Unrest Surges, Recovery Encounters Many Obstacles</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Likely to Intervene</p>
<p>(New York) Recently, the monetary issue in the United States has become increasingly complex, and the labor disputes that have sprung up everywhere are showing signs of further expansion. These two factors seem to have a significant impact on the success of President Roosevelt's recovery plan. The anxiety of various advisors to the US government has become increasingly difficult to conceal recently. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(New York) As labor unrest gradually spreads to many places, a portion of the striking coal miners took actions today that were quite unstable. At the Carnegie Steel plant in Clairborne, Pennsylvania, which employs 6,000 workers, 5,000 striking miners came to harass them, tearing the clothes of some of the factory workers, snatching food from the lunch boxes they carried, and inducing them to join the strike. The anthracite industry in Pennsylvania and Virginia is now almost completely shut down. Strikers at the Chrysler car plant of Ford Company are now threatening to go to Dearborn to prevent work at the Ford factory there. Meanwhile, 400 workers at the Ford factory in Richmond, California, are planning a sympathy strike. The Governor of Pennsylvania today flew to Hyde Park to ask President Roosevelt to intervene as soon as possible, so as to prevent the labor unrest from reaching a level that endangers the national recovery movement. There has been no indication from Hyde Park or Washington yet, but there is considerable activity behind the scenes. It is rumored that President Roosevelt will make an appeal for economic peace to the world with a posture that is more moving than peaceful requests on military preparedness. William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, claimed that the Federation has increased its membership by 1.5 million in the past three months, and that all the funds used by the Federation for labor matters have also increased as a result. The union plans to request from the National Recovery Administration and Congress a provision in the industry codes stipulating a 30-hour work week. President Green made this statement while the Recovery Administration is considering the possibility of temporarily not implementing the current new standards for wages and working hours for the construction industry and similar industries. However, Green's demand for a 30-hour work week clearly expresses the union's absolute opposition to the Recovery Administration's current plan to postpone the implementation of the new standards. The Recovery Administration is paying attention to this difficult problem, but also stated that the final decision will be made after General Johnson considers it. Green notified the metal industry workers that the industry has not been quick enough to hire more workers as required by the situation, and that the only remedy now is to have six-hour days and five-day weeks. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Metallurgical and Mining Agreement Approved</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt approved an agreement between the coal mine employers and employees of the metallurgical industry. According to the agreement, the employers agree to grant employees working conditions that are as favorable as those stipulated in the anthracite industry code. After the approval of this agreement, President Roosevelt hopes that the 75,000 miners currently on strike in Pennsylvania can resume work on Monday. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Currency Declaration to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt is about to issue a currency declaration. According to sources in high places, the declaration will include currency devaluation, currency value stabilization, and a promise to restore the gold standard. According to a New York Times report today, President Roosevelt's reason for issuing this declaration is that the recovery movement has reached an important stage, and difficulties have arisen in the rural and public works offices. Recent news shows that production and distribution are both sluggish, and the number of people gaining employment and wage increases is half offset by the reduction in working hours and the rise in the cost of living.

<h3>Italy Proposes Expanding Danube River Economy</h3>

It is said that this note is in accordance with the spirit of the declaration by Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Expulsion of German Journalists by Russia</h3>
<p>German Government Issues Verbal Note</p>
<p>Considers Russia's Action Unwise</p>
<p>National Daily, Berlin, 29th - Regarding the recent expulsion of German journalists residing in Soviet Russia by the Soviet authorities, the German government today sent a verbal note to the Soviet government, detailing the circumstances and stating that, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, the German Foreign Office cannot consider the expulsion of the German journalists by the Soviet government to be justified, as the incident originated from a very minor matter caused by a mistake on the part of a Soviet journalist. The incident was caused by Mrs. Keyes, a reporter for the TASS news agency, who went to Leipzig to cover the Reichstag fire trial without completing certain procedures and was mistakenly arrested, but was released after a brief interrogation, and the German authorities expressed their apologies. The Soviet authorities considered this an intentional insult and, in retaliation, ordered the expulsion of all German journalists stationed in Moscow. Furthermore, the verbal note issued by the German government stated, "From the perspective of news experts, Russia's expulsion of German journalists is unwise, as it appears to have hindered future friendship between the two countries, and the Soviet Union should bear full responsibility for this."</p>

According to him, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has closed and the commissioners have taken office. He went to Tianjin, Jinan, Zhengzhou, and Kaifeng to inspect the Yellow River and deeply felt that the cause of the floods was that the embankments along the river had been in disrepair for many years, resulting in a great disaster.

The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee is responsible for the two tasks of blocking the breach and post-disaster relief. As for the surveying team organized in Tianjin, it has now set off.

<h3>Campaign Against Reds in Southern Jiangxi Conducted in Three Routes</h3>
<p>Xiong Shihui Talks to Reuters Reporter</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Today, Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, told a special reporter from Reuters that he is currently carrying out the campaign against the Reds in southern Jiangxi in three routes: one is road construction, the second is the construction of fortresses, and the third is the reorganization of rural areas. The highway between Nanfeng and Ji'an has now been built, and the road is protected by fortresses along the way wherever it approaches the bandit areas, so it is very safe. All villages and towns with more than 200 households have organized self-defense militias and set up fortresses to prevent the bandits from attacking. There are telephones between villages and cities to communicate news. In the event of a bandit alert, the entire city's militia can be dispatched at any time. Since the abolition of the Likin tax, farmers' taxes have suddenly increased. Jiangxi Province is now implementing a kind of goods tax, dividing various goods into agricultural materials, products, and luxury goods, and levying taxes separately. In this way, the burden on farmers can be slightly reduced. At the same time, Jiangxi Province is implementing a new tax collection law, in which the people automatically submit their taxes directly to the county magistrate without going through tax collectors. Xiong continued to say that he intends to compile a household registration book for Jiangxi Province. Two counties have already started compiling it. Three rural normal schools have been opened a few days ago, with a total of 200 students. Everyone is able to practice in the countryside as a practical exercise. Cooperatives have been established in 300 locations across Jiangxi Province to benefit farmers. These cooperatives borrow money from the Jiangxi branch of the Farmers Bank of China, which is run by Chairman Chiang, at an interest rate of 8% for opening up wasteland and building embankments along Poyang Lake, implementing the method of providing work instead of relief. Regarding the suppression of the Communists, Xiong said that Chairman Chiang is confident that he can eliminate the Communists in southern Jiangxi before Christmas this year. Once the remaining bandits are eliminated, the Jiangxi authorities will form an immigration committee to be responsible for immigrating to the recovered areas. Xiong also said that the Provincial Department of Education is working on editing new textbooks for the purpose of educating residents in the bandit areas, because these farmers have been influenced by the Red bandits for a long time and it is inevitable that their thinking has deteriorated, so it is necessary to correct their ideological errors and use the correct teachings of Confucius to awaken the farmers.

<h3>Inauguration of Special Party Headquarters Representatives Conference of the Air Force</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The first plenary session of the Special Party Headquarters Representatives Conference of the Chinese Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army Air Force was held at 9:00 AM on the 30th in the auditorium of the Central Aviation School in Jianqiao. The Central Committee sent Commissioner Chen Bulei to attend the supervision and election. The preparatory committee members Xu Peigen, Cao Baoqing, Mao Bangchu, Jiang Jianren, Cai Zhuping, Yan Yucong, Jiang Qiyuan, Secretary-General Xu Hongtao, the General Assembly representatives Xiao Jian and others, totaling 46 people, more than 30 representatives from all walks of life, all officers of the Aviation Administration and its affiliated agencies, and all students of the Aviation School, totaling about 500 people. After the venue was arranged in a splendid and solemn manner and the ceremony was performed as usual, Chairman Xu Peigen first delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that the success of the Party must have three essential elements: first, the lofty morality of the Party members; second, the strict discipline within the Party; and third, the clear and smooth goals of the Party. The success of our Party's Xinhai Revolution was due to the fact that it possessed the above three points. After the second year of the Republic, the Party's morality declined day by day, the Party's discipline relaxed day by day, and the Party's goals gradually became blurred, so the revolution failed. Later, the first reorganization of the Chinese Revolutionary Party and the second reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang were all attempts to revive the Party's morality, rectify the Party's discipline, and determine the Party's goals. Today, we are holding the Air Force General Assembly, and we should have the morality of sacrificing for the Party, obeying Party discipline, and establishing the goal of overthrowing imperialism. Then, Central Committee member Chen Bulei delivered a training speech, briefly stating that the Air Force Party Headquarters was able to complete the preparations in three months, and the work performed was extremely perfect and substantial. The Central Committee is extremely satisfied with this. The Air Force is a newly emerging force in China, and the importance of the mission of the Air Force Party Headquarters is not difficult to imagine. Only by building an Air Force that fights for the cause can the authority of the Party be enhanced. Enhancing the authority of the Party lies in enriching the strength of the Party, and the enrichment of the strength of the Party lies in the efforts of each Party member. I hope that the Air Force comrades will make special efforts. Next, Hu Jianzhi, a representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, Xia Qingyun, a representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and many others delivered speeches, expressing the greatest hope for the Air Force's party affairs. Then, photos were taken. Finally, the Aviation School sent 12 aircraft to form a formation and perform various techniques, and distributed 100,000 copies of the circulars of the Preparatory Committee of the Air Force Party Headquarters, and then announced the completion of the ceremony. At 2:00 PM on the same afternoon, the first plenary session was held in the auditorium of the Central Aviation School. Representatives and preparatory committee member Chen Minshu and others, totaling 55 people, performed the ceremony as usual. First, Jiang Jianren, Mao Bangchu, Xu Peigen, Shi Ying, and Cao Baoqing and other five people were elected as the presidium, with Cao Baoqing as the chairman. After delivering an opening speech, Secretary-General Xu Hongtao of the Committee reported on the work of the Preparatory Committee.

<h3>The Current State of the Japanese Aviation Industry in the Eyes of an American</h3>
<p>-How Will Our Countrymen Rise Up and Strive to Compete With Them?-</p>
<p>Recently, the United States has paid close attention to the strengthening of Japanese military preparations. Recently, a certain magazine published an article on the current state of the Japanese Air Force, which was translated by a Japanese person, Yamamuro Sei, and published in the Nagoya Shimbun. It is now translated from the Nagoya Shimbun below to clarify a glimpse of the contents of Japanese aviation.</p>
<p>General Billy Mitchell once said that Japan's absorption of world civilization was all guided by Americans, which is why it has the current state of the aviation industry. It is recalled that Japan first had a hot air balloon in 1892. In 1909, Charles K. Hamilton had an airship soaring in the sky over Tokyo. In 1911, Mr. Mars publicly flew aircraft in various parts of Japan, which aroused the attention of the people of Japan and promoted the motivation for the development of the Japanese aviation industry. Following Mars, was the American W.B. Side Air, who used seaplanes to guide mail transportation between Tokyo and Yokohama. In 1916, the Americans Smith and Nalas held stunt flights, and the Japanese people were even more surprised and had a major impulse, which opened the way for the development of the Japanese aviation industry.</p>
<h3>The Strength of the Air Force</h3>
<p>In the 1933 fiscal year, the Japanese Army had eight flight regiments, each regiment owning 800 excellent aircraft. The Navy had 450 seaplanes and 350 carrier-based aircraft, totaling approximately 1,450 aircraft. Other civil aviation routes are extended year by year and have been connected with Manchuria. And Japan's current aircraft production, about nine-tenths are domestically produced. Foreign aircraft are gradually decreasing. American-made aircraft and engines have also gradually been driven out by Japan. The Japanese Army and Navy hardly use American-made materials. However, the Japan Air Transport Company, which transports mail and passengers, still has some Fokker-Spars, and Le Rhône-Besson engines. However, these engines will also be replaced by Japanese-made ones. The Japanese factories were initially designed by foreign countries, such as Nieuport (note that the system is the French name Nieuport, invented by the Frenchman Edward, the so-called (Edward Nieuport), Salomon, Grosta and other aircraft, all custom-made from foreign countries. In recent years, the Japanese have imitated various types of aircraft. Japanese-produced aircraft for the Army and Navy have accounted for eight-tenths of the total. The aircraft industry has now entered the era of metal structure. The new first-class machinery is mostly made of aluminum alloy, such as the Nakajima Type 90 fighter, the Kawasaki Type 92 fighter, the Kawasaki Type 88 reconnaissance and bomber), the Mitsubishi reconnaissance aircraft, the Nakajima Type 90 carrier-based fighter, and the Kawanishi Type 90 seaplane reconnaissance aircraft (the numbers of various styles indicate the year in which they were successfully produced. The Japanese calendar year 2592 is the Western calendar year 1932. The Kawasaki Type 92 fighter was completed in 1932 in the Western calendar, and the Type 88 was completed in 1928.) The aircraft industry is mostly due to its own unique initiative. Although it has not reached the level of all-metal manufacturing, the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Aircraft Factory has manufactured three types according to the Tronier formula. Recently, Mitsubishi Aircraft Co., Ltd. built the Yuan Jia Si G38 (a giant aircraft equipped with four engines). Kawanishi Aviation Co., Ltd. built a giant all-metal seaplane. The Guang Naval Factory surpasses individual factories and strives for improvement. Its excellent skills are like the giant all-metal seaplane Type 90-1, made in 1930, equipped with three Ise-Bano 700-horsepower engines.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Aircraft Factory</h3>
<p>Japan currently has six major civilian aircraft factories, namely Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Kawanishi, Ishikawajima, Nakajima, and Aichi Clock Electric. There are also five aircraft engine manufacturers, such as Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Nakajima, Aichi, and Tokyo Gas Electric. These factories are dedicated to the production of military aircraft and do not manufacture export products. However, recently, Nakajima Manufacturing Co. manufactured five Fokker-style passenger aircraft and sold them to the newly established Manchurian Air Transport Company. In terms of the manufacture of military aircraft, the Army also has Nagoya and Chikusak factories. The Navy has the Hiroshima and Yokosuka naval factories. Generally, military designs are often used, but for the benefit of civilian companies, civilian designs are sometimes also used. Government supervision is very strict. New types of aircraft are not allowed to be made public. Today, Japan can also imitate high-horsepower engines designed by Japan, such as Ise-Bano, Napier, Lorraine, Kubei, and BMW.</p>
<h3>Inspection and Design Competition</h3>
<p>For new aircraft manufactured by civilian companies according to government designs, the Navy has strict inspections at the Yokosuka Naval Factory, and the Army has strict inspections at the Tachikawa Aviation Technical Headquarters (the reporter was introduced by Principal Kinoshita in the 9th year of the Republic of China and visited the three factories. Except for the aircraft manufacturing parts that are allowed to be visited, the rest are strictly secret.) In order to promote the development of the civilian aircraft industry, the government has held flight competitions to allow aircraft manufactured by civilian companies to participate. If an aircraft is considered to be superior, it will be adopted as a military aircraft. The Nakajima Type 91 fighter (air-cooled) and the Kawasaki Type 92 fighter (water-cooled) are examples of this. The relationship between the government and the aircraft manufacturing industry is extremely close. In terms of civilian aspects, if foreign models are needed, Mitsubishi Mitsui often purchases them from foreign countries. During this period, the promotion of famous newspapers in various ports has been particularly powerful in promoting the development of the Japanese aviation industry. Although, the Japanese aviation industry has made great leaps in recent years, its current efforts are far inferior to those of the major countries in the world. However, recently, it has been realized the importance of air defense, and the people have all realized the power of aviation to protect the country. At the same time, the manufacture of warships and submarines has also received great assistance from the people.</p>
<h3>Naval Aircraft Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Since 1909, Japan has understood the effectiveness of aircraft in ocean warfare. The naval committee of 21 people, including Colonel K. Yamamuro, researched the performance. The following year, five officers were dispatched to the United States and France to study aircraft technology. At the same time, three mechanical lieutenants were sent to Europe and the United States to study institutions. One of the three is now the director of the Nakajima Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, named Mr. Nakajima Chikuhei. In 1912, Prince Kaya brought back two Florman seaplanes from France and two Curtis seaplanes from the United States. After returning to China, he immediately set up an aircraft field near Yokosuka Naval Port and trained six young aviators. At the end of 1913, the Navy had 100-horsepower and 140-horsepower Gnome engines. Afterwards, it purchased two more Deperdussin seaplanes with greater speed from France. The pilots who operated this new aircraft were the naval aviators who were trained. During this period, naval technicians personally manufactured seaplanes. After several trials, the Florman airship was manufactured using domestic materials. At the same time, the number of aviators also increased year by year. Later, the Navy remodeled the transport ship Wakamiya into the first aircraft carrier, equipped with five Florman aircraft for trial maritime flights. In 1914, Wakamiya transported seaplanes to Qingdao to begin reconnaissance and bombing of fortresses. In 1915, the engine also had the Japanese-made Florman type, which could fly in the air for ten hours. This was the performance of the engine manufactured at the naval factory at the end of 1914. The test results were also excellent. At the end of World War I, De Lia military boats were purchased from France. The following year, a De Lia airship equipped with two Ise-Bano Sisha 300-horsepower engines was purchased. Since then, efforts have been made to research large airships. In 1919, 60% of military aircraft were made of Japanese materials. In 1918, the Navy, due to the expansion of the Naval Air Force, established a large aircraft manufacturing plant in Wu Naval Port. When the plant was completed, it was said to have the capacity to manufacture 60 aircraft per month. Before long, a naval aircraft manufacturing plant appeared in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Training of Naval Aviators</h3>
<p>In 1912, construction began on the aircraft carrier Hosho Maru. At the same time, it was deeply felt that naval flight required land-based control. A large naval aircraft field was established in Kasumigaura. In the same year, Lieutenant Colonel Shembial and others of the British Air Force were recruited to serve as naval instructors, and seaplanes, land-based aircraft, flying boats and engines were purchased from the United Kingdom. On the one hand, private companies established Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Aichi, Nakajima, and other companies to manufacture military aircraft. After the war, Mitsubishi manufactured naval training aircraft. In 1922, the first aircraft carrier Hosho Maru was completed, and aircraft became part of the fleet. By 1923, all-metal large airships began to research and test Rohrback and Tronier airships. By 1930, the all-metal monoplane airship Type 90-1 (equipped with three Ise-Bano 700-horsepower engines) was completed at the Guang Naval Factory. In the same year, a Shuttleworth airship (equipped with three Rolls-Royce 800-horsepower engines) was purchased from the United Kingdom. Kawanishi Aircraft Manufacturing Plant obtained the construction rights of the Shuttleworth formula and began manufacturing. The Guang Factory's Type 90-1 is considered the standard naval aircraft. In 1925, the Navy's Type 4, equipped with a Lorraine 400-horsepower engine, was designated as a seaplane reconnaissance aircraft. The following year, the performance of the Lorraine 450-horsepower engine was improved. All three multi-seat aircraft were loaded on Japanese battleships and cruisers. The Navy's standard two-seat reconnaissance aircraft was the Ise-Bano 300-horsepower Type 15, which was a remodeled British Hansa-Brandenburg aircraft. Equipped with two Lorraine 450-horsepower engines, its organization was repeatedly improved. After the aircraft was completed, it was first tested several times between Yokosuka and the Marshall Islands (approximately 2,500 nautical miles). In 1928, the Gloster Gambet (Curtis 450-horsepower) won the competition for the best carrier-based fighter, and manufacturing rights were purchased from the United Kingdom. This aircraft was the first aerial battle in the Orient. During the Shanghai Incident, it competed with Chinese fighter aircraft (piloted by the American Schuttleworth) and finally shot down the aircraft. In 1929, the Navy's Type 89 biplane bomber was completed. Its same capacity has not yet been made public. It is feared that it is equipped with Ise-Bano or Rolls-Royce, a 650-horsepower excellent bomber with an 18-inch torpedo and a cruising range of 750 nautical miles. In 1930, the Nakajima-made Type 90 fighter, the Kawanishi-made Type 90 reconnaissance aircraft, and the Navy's Type 90-1 seaplane reconnaissance aircraft (all equipped with Curtis 450-horsepower engines) were adopted by the Navy. The current Hognem-Lord carrier-based single-seat fighter is also being tested by the naval factory. The manufacturing machine was first purchased from the United Kingdom. Today, Japan is striving to imitate several types of carrier-based bombers, carrier-based two-seat fighters, large flying boats for coastal patrol, etc. The Navy authorities are very strict in inspection.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the New British Envoy to China</h3>
<p>Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen Served in Geneva for a Long Time</p>
<p>Also Very Familiar with Our Country's Envoys Yen and Shih</p>
<p>Reuter's report from London on the 3rd states, it has been an open secret in political circles here for several weeks that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is to succeed as British Envoy to China, which has now been officially verified today. This reporter specially drove to Sir Hugessen's London residence to interview him for a long time. Although Sir Hugessen has not yet been to China, he has been serving in the British delegation office in Geneva for a long time, and he has interacted with people from various countries, and he is also very familiar with China's Ambassador to Russia, Yen Hui-ching, and Minister to the United States, Shih Chao-chi. According to the personal impressions of this reporter, it seems that Sir Hugessen is very familiar with the various special issues that should be handled during his tenure as the Envoy to China. Sir Hugessen must now take a trip abroad, and then stay in the Foreign Office for some time. It is expected that he will not be able to start his journey to China before January next year.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou's Invisible Martial Law</h3>
<p>An Extreme Manifestation of Terror</p>
<p>Military and Political Figures Repeatedly Arrested</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, a blue terror scene has been extremely manifested here. The authorities have long been secretly investigating and arresting, successively cracking down on organizations and executing a reporter surnamed Hou from a Hong Kong newspaper by shooting (a student of Zhongshan University). Also, a member of the executive committee of a certain county's party department was arrested and imprisoned. There have also been several cases of active and retired military and political figures being detained. In mid-September, an invisible martial law was imposed on the entire city of Guangzhou. This was because the authorities found communications from so-called Blue Shirt Party members in the mail, and investigated and arrested people according to the addresses. Yesterday, several suspects were taken to the Public Security Bureau from a certain place. Those who were working in institutions included two employees of the Works Department of the Yuehan Railway, one employee of the Cleaning Section of a certain bureau, and two people from a certain senior military institution, all of whom have been detained. On the evening of the 19th, the authorities again dispatched armed police to No. 4 Lian Residence, Tongfu West Back Street, Henan Island, and, together with the police, arrested several well-dressed men from the residence and took them to the Public Security Bureau for secret interrogation. It was found that the Lian Residence was the residence of Lian Bingzhang, the former commander of the 16th Division of the Fifth Army (Li Fulin's troops). Lian Bingzhang was also arrested and questioned that night. On the 20th, the headquarters of the First Army Group also suspected He Yilu, the current captain of the Jiangda warship, of being a member of the Blue Shirt Party. At about 1 p.m. that afternoon, Chen Jitang used the telephone to order Zhang Zhiying, the commander of the fleet, to have He come to the headquarters, saying that he had something to discuss in person. Zhang then informed He and went to the headquarters, where Chen personally met him, asked a question or two, and then telegraphed Zhang Zhiying to come to the headquarters and take He back to the fleet headquarters for custody. He also sent two adjutants to search He's residence in Taiping Sha. All documents and correspondence were taken back to the headquarters for review. At about 4 p.m. on the 21st, investigators at the headquarters learned that a certain residence outside the police boundary in the northern suburbs, which was not listed with a house number, was a general meeting place for a certain reactionary organization. Chen Jitang immediately ordered the headquarters of the military police to send out detectives and military police to search. However, the people involved had already fled after hearing the news. Only a large number of important documents and leaflets were found in the organization. Therefore, all military and political institutions in Guangzhou suddenly imposed martial law that night. The headquarters of the First Army Group added military police to stand guard and patrol from evening to 6 a.m. the next morning, from Zhengnan Road in the east to Hua Ningli in the south, to the side of Central Park in the west, and to Dexuan East Road in the north. From 11 p.m., passers-by could not pass without a password. The defense was withdrawn at 6 a.m. on the 22nd. The Public Security Bureau also implemented martial law on the same night, and armed police were sent to guard all areas near Weixin Road. Although the curfew was short, it was enough to see the situation in Guangzhou. (September 25th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province to Levy Tax on Imported Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>Special Tax Bureau Limits Rice Merchants to Declare and Pay Taxes</p>
<p>Investigation of Tax Rates on Miscellaneous Imported Agricultural Products</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Provincial Government has decided to levy a foreign rice tax of one yuan per hundred catties and also a foreign grain tax of six jiao per hundred catties. Rice merchants in Guangzhou have not yet complied with the implementation. However, the Special Tax Bureau for Imported Agricultural Products has already opened on the 16th. Branch bureaus have also been established in the Five Counties, Qiongyai, and Chao Mei areas, and personnel have been dispatched to start collecting taxes. Branch checkpoints have been set up in Ershui, Shenzhen, and Chencun to prevent smuggling. The Guangzhou Agricultural Tax Bureau has already sent a letter to the Guangzhou Rice Merchants Association, urging them to pay the tax arrears and sending personnel to various rice shops to persuade them, limiting them to pay in accordance with the regulations within three days. The tax rates for the collection of miscellaneous special taxes on imported agricultural products are as follows: Caviar, milk shortcake, honey, fruit jam, fruit juice, frozen soy sauce, sarsaparilla, and other unnamed seasonings, all are taxed at 15 yuan per hundred yuan of cargo value. Chocolate, cocoa, coffee, the above three items are taxed at 12 yuan per hundred yuan of cargo value. Lard, apples (in addition to the public fees payable by the provincial Chen Xian Guo Xian Huo industry) are taxed at 7 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. Unnamed dried fruits, fresh fruits, oranges (including Jinsheng orange, lemon, etc.) in addition to the public fees payable by the provincial Chen Xian Guo Xian Huo industry are taxed at 7 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. Salted pork, foreign ham (such as canned and other loaded tax 3 yuan) fish, seafood, canned food, and various meats are taxed at 10 yuan per hundred yuan of cargo value. Baking powder, corned beef, biscuits, the above three items are taxed at 8 yuan per hundred yuan of cargo value. Mushrooms (this item is taxed by the catty) are taxed at 7 yuan per hundred yuan.

Those who refuse inspection, pursuit, or resist arrest will be reported to the Department of Finance for investigation and confiscation. (September 26th)</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Suppression of Bandits in the Border Areas of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua to Concurrently Supervise Post-War Rehabilitation</p>
<p>He Chengjun Goes to Sichuan on Jiang's Orders</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Jiang has specially appointed Tian Songyao as the Bandit Suppression Supervisor of Sichuan Province, to supervise the suppression of Xu Xiangqian's remnants, Xu Yuanquan as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hunan-Hubei Border Region, to supervise the suppression of He Long's remnants, and Liu Zhenhua as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, to supervise the suppression of Kuang Jixun's remnants, while entrusting He Chengjun, the Pacification Director stationed in Hubei, to be in charge of the overall situation. Later, due to the situation in Sichuan, Tian Songyao's troops suffered repeated defeats, and Liu Xiang was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan Province, taking full responsibility. In the past two months, Liu Zhenhua has supervised Liu Maoen, Sun Lianzhong, Liang Guanying, Song Tiancai, Hao Mengling, Shangguan Yunxiang, Peng Zhenshan, Wan Yaohuang, and Dai Minquan to advance and suppress bandits in multiple routes, repeatedly attacking bandit dens. There are no longer any traces of bandits in the border area between Henan and Anhui. Although the area around Huang'an and Macheng in eastern Hubei has not yet been completely cleared, the main force has indeed been broken. In addition to continuing the suppression, Liu is also working on post-war rehabilitation. When He Chengjun went to Lushan to meet Jiang, he entrusted Li Shucheng, a member of the Hubei Provincial Committee, to go with him, requesting Chairman Jiang to designate the counties in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region as special administrative regions and to raise 4.9 million yuan for post-war rehabilitation. Liu's reasons for the proposal are: (1) The areas in the border region of the three provinces that have been ravaged by bandits have been for as long as seven years and as short as two or three years. The rural areas have been completely destroyed, and the people have been deeply redized. Without special politics, the root cause cannot be rectified and the bandit disaster will never be eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary to establish special administrative regions. (2) Rural areas in the border region are bankrupt, and the disaster situation is extremely serious. After the recovery, the resettlement of refugees, encouraging them to cultivate, as well as emergency relief, work relief, and agricultural relief all require funds. A post-war rehabilitation fund of 4.9 million yuan is not enough to inject funds. When He and Li met Jiang and asked for instructions in person, Jiang indicated that he would adopt the proposal and set up a post-war rehabilitation supervisor in the special administrative regions divided in the three provinces to preside over the matter. It is also heard that Liu Zhenhua will be appointed to this position concurrently, so that orders can be unified and military and political affairs can be planned together. This measure will probably be realized in a few days. He bandits in the Hunan-Hubei border region have been heavily damaged by Xu Yuanquan's supervision and the joint efforts of the Hunan and Hubei troops. Not long ago, although they once captured Songzi and fled south on a large scale, they soon retreated into Hunan. Xu Yuanquan and Fan Xiji have gone to Yichang from Shashi via the mountains in the Hunan-Hubei border region to go to Shihe to supervise the suppression. The future is optimistic. Xu bandits in Sichuan Province occupy Tongnanba and other counties in northern Sichuan and have not yet been recovered. Although the Sichuan provincial troops have claimed to advance and suppress, they have not yet sent troops. Only Liu Cunhou, Tian Songyao, and their old and weak remnants are dealing with them. Now Liu Xiang has set October 1st to take office as the Commander-in-Chief in Chengdu, and has asked Jiang to specially send senior officials to Sichuan to supervise the oath and give instructions. Jiang has appointed He Chengjun as the supervising committee member. He will take a plane from Ganzhou to Hankou on the 24th, and is scheduled to fly to Chongqing from Hankou on the 27th with Qiu Jia, Liu Xiang's representative, and Zeng Kuangqing, a member of the Central Committee, and then go to Chengdu. After Liu Xiang takes office, he will convene a bandit suppression military conference of Sichuan generals Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, and second-tier generals Wang Lingji, etc. to determine the overall plan and mobilize on a large scale. On the way back, he will go to Shihe in western Hubei to inspect the bandit suppression situation of Xu's troops and hold a meeting with Xu Yuanquan and other generals to discuss ways to completely eliminate the He bandits. After returning to Hankou, he will go to southern and northern Hubei to continue his inspection. (September 25th)</p>
<h3>Wujiang, Upstream of Nanjing, Captured by Bandits</h3>
<p>- Nearby Towns Mostly Looted -</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: He County, across the river from Caishi upstream of Nanjing, Kunlian, Quanjiao, and Jiangpu County in Jiangsu Province produce a lot of cotton, and business is prosperous. Recently, a large number of bandits suddenly appeared, looting nearby towns. Last night, the Jingwu merchant ship from Jing arrived in Wuhu, carrying many refugees. According to them, Wujiang Town, He County, was besieged by four or five hundred bandits the day before (27th). Most of the bandits were wearing white plain clothes and claimed to be part of the Zhang Dabizi bandit group who had previously captured Hanshan County. Although the soldiers of the anti-smuggling battalion and the security team stationed there gathered to resist, they were defeated due to being outnumbered. The bandits drove straight in, first confiscating the firearms of the Public Security Bureau and the Special Tax Office, and then wantonly looting. Wealthy families were led by local ruffians to plunder. They are still entrenched in the town and forbid all the people in the town to go out. The bandits came from upstream of Wujiang. Chizhen, the first town of Quanjiao County, and Xiangquan Street, He County, were also ransacked and all the firearms and weapons of the security team were confiscated. The details of the losses cannot be detailed because the merchant ship did not dare to stop after passing Wujiang. After the bandits occupied Wujiang, a part of them advanced along the river through Shibahe towards He County. Xie Shouheng, the magistrate of the county, who had only taken office for half a month, immediately mobilized the security team to guard the city after hearing the alarm, and the four gates were tightly closed. On the one hand, he sent an urgent telegram to the commissioners' offices of the second and fifth districts for help. One hundred and twenty security team members were transferred here last night and rushed to help defend by the Depu special ship overnight. The Salt Affairs Inspection Office also received a report of heavy losses. (September 29th)</p>
<h3>Closing of the Yellow River Commission</h3>
<p>- Wang Yingyu and Others Remain in Bian to Form the Yellow River Economic Commission -</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Yellow River Conservancy Commission held its first general meeting yesterday (26th) morning, deciding to divide the 80 proposals into three categories and assign them to three groups of committee members for review. At about 2 p.m., the review was held separately upstairs in the Provincial Government Conference Hall. The first group was divided into 25 cases, and the third group was divided into 23 cases. The review was completed by 5 p.m., but the review of 27 cases by the second group and the outline of the first case's work, which was reviewed jointly with the first group, was not completed. The meeting adjourned at about 5 p.m. After attending Liu Zhi's banquet, the review continued in the evening. The original 80 cases were merged into 42 cases. At 9 a.m. this morning (27th), the second general meeting was held, and the meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m. for a break. They went to the banquet set up by Chen Panling, Li Peiji, and Zhang Jingyu in the Construction Department. The meeting continued at 2 p.m. Shanxi Provincial Director Zhao Shouyu rushed to attend, but Liu Ruyao, the representative of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, has not yet appeared. The discussion ended at about 3 p.m. Chen Panling and others had temporary motions until 4 p.m., when the general meeting ended. At 5 p.m., the committee members attended a banquet hosted by the party, government, and military leaders of Kaifeng. Li Shutian is scheduled to leave Bian tonight, Lin Chengxiu is scheduled to inspect Dongming and Puyang with Zhou Xiangxian on the 29th, and Li Yizhi is scheduled to go to Beijing with his secretary Li Fulin on the morning of the 28th. Other committee members and representatives will also return to their posts. However, Zhang Hanying will stay in Bian to preside over the change of the office into a public education center. Wang Yingyu and other nine people will discuss the organization and planning of the Yellow River Economic Commission in the Construction Department at 9 a.m. tomorrow in accordance with the resolution of the ninth case.

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute at Yufeng Yarn Factory in Henan</h3>
<p>- A Person Familiar with the Situation at Yufeng Yarn Factory Talks -</p>
<p>According to someone familiar with the situation at the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Zhengzhou, the factory stopped work on July 29 this year due to business losses and a lack of cotton. At that time, the factory announced the termination of the workers' contracts in accordance with Article 30 of the Factory Law, and paid the wages for the notice period in accordance with the same law. This would have allowed them to end all past processes and reorganize freely when work resumed in the future, so as to obtain a new life. Unexpectedly, the official authorities intervened based on the request of the trade union and advocated paying the workers' maintenance fees during the shutdown period. Although the mediation method stipulated that the factory had the right to increase or decrease and freely hire workers, the factory was recently opposed by the trade union when it was preparing to resume work and reorganize, which led to new disputes. Recent news about the labor-management dispute at the factory, as reported in various newspapers, is mostly one-sided and does not fully correspond to the facts. Therefore, the truth is restated as follows:</p>
<p>The Yufeng Yarn Factory was established in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, for the purpose of developing the inland industry. Since 1927, due to its location and trends, it has been controlled by the trade union. In the past six or seven years, there have been no less than 20 various demands, often with the threat of guns. A former associate manager of the factory was robbed by armed workers and almost met with an accident. Because of the irresistible force, the factory's monthly expenditure on wages alone increased from 30,000 yuan to more than 50,000 yuan, increasing the annual expenditure by about 300,000 yuan. The working hours were reduced from 12 hours per shift to 10 hours, and work was stopped for 4 hours per day, resulting in uncompensated losses. However, the number of workers could not be reduced, resulting in huge costs. Over the years, the business has been losing money and it has been almost impossible to maintain. The factory, seeing that the factory affairs were so difficult and could not last, tried its best to study and improve the machines. In the autumn of 1930, it invented the Mujuzhi large extension and immediately improved all the machines to increase production and reduce losses. Unexpectedly, the trade union took this as its own achievement and demanded a huge bonus. Although there were still losses in the year-end accounts, the factory still paid a bonus of 43,000 yuan due to pressure from the official authorities. The following year, they made another request. After several months of stalemate, the result was that the factory still paid a bonus of 60,000 yuan due to the mediation of the official authorities. This year, the factory suffered even greater losses due to cotton yarn and had to stop work. It was originally intended to pay severance in accordance with the Factory Law in order to thoroughly reorganize, but this was not achieved because the official authorities listened only to the one-sided words of the trade union and advocated paying maintenance fees. However, the factory is a commercial enterprise and will continue to lose money. This time, the factory will follow the general practice of yarn factories across the country, setting the working hours at 12 hours per shift (if the government can uniformly change all factories across the country to 10 hours per shift, the factory will also be very willing to comply), and reducing the number of workers per 10,000 spindles to more than 540, which is still a huge difference compared to the 240 workers employed by Japanese-owned yarn factories in China. This is the minimum reform. If it cannot be done, the factory will not be able to maintain. In recent years, there has been a lot of silver in Shanghai, so people dare not invest in developing industries in the interior, because they cannot get political protection when running industries in the interior. If the government really wants to increase production, it must start by protecting inland industries. The factory has suffered great sacrifices due to the times. I wonder whether the government, which has a policy of increasing production, can open a way for inland industries. The solution to the factory's dispute will be known.</p>

<h3>Graduation of Special Agent Training Class</h3>
<p>This county was ordered to organize a security regiment. Last year, it opened a special agent training class and distributed the trainees to various districts to teach the security regiment Ding. Since Commissioner Jin took office, he continued to open the second phase of the training class at the original site of the tenth factory, actively training because the original non-training personnel were not enough to distribute. The training has now been completed. A field trip was held the day before yesterday, and yesterday, the regiment director Wu Changding and the team leader Wu Zongjun led them to Xiaojiaochang for target practice. The results were good. The graduation ceremony will be held at 9 a.m. today (30th). Commissioner Jin, who is also the general regiment leader, will personally give a speech. More than 20 guests from various agencies will attend. There are 48 graduates and 28 refresher students in this class. Certificates will be given and photos will be taken.</p>

<h3>Ship Robbed in Huangtiandang</h3>
<p>Gu Wenbin's ship, which runs from Chenmu to Suzhou, left Chenmu the day before yesterday (29th). When it passed Gaodian Town in the afternoon, two bandits boarded the ship. When it entered Huangtiandang Lake, they started robbing. They robbed about 100 yuan in cash and goods and fled ashore.</p>
<h3>Change of Water and Land Public Security Chiefs</h3>
<p>Shen Gaozhen, the chief of the third and second districts of the Water Public Security Bureau, was ordered to be transferred to the director of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau. The vacancy was filled by Wei Zhanyuan. Shen is scheduled to go to the Public Security Bureau to take over today (1st) morning. The former director Mao Naigong convened his subordinates yesterday (30th) noon to hold a farewell meeting. After Wei Zhanyuan was appointed, he came to Suzhou yesterday (30th) and is scheduled to go to Wuxi on the 2nd to take over the second district's affairs, and to Suzhou on the 3rd to take over the third district's affairs. Also, Xu Baoguang, the director of the Wuxian Security Regiment, was appointed as the director of the Wujin Public Security Bureau and is scheduled to go to Changzhou on the 2nd to take over.</p>

<h3>Ignorance of Bombs Almost Causes Great Disaster</h3>
<p>Zhang Falin, a carpenter from Changzhou and Yangliupu, West Wai Xingchun Street, has a wife, sons, and six family members. Yesterday (29th), his eldest son Jiwen, 16, picked up a grenade the size of an egg by the river. Not knowing what it was, he threw the bomb into the stove to burn while he was cooking lunch. Unexpectedly, there was a loud explosion, the earthen stove was shattered, and the vegetables in the pot went straight to the roof. Falin's wife had one ear blown off, and her legs and hands were all seriously injured. Jiwen's hair and face were also blown off. The injured were taken to the Gospel Hospital for treatment and are not in life-threatening condition.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Searching for Son Tragically Drowns</h3>
<p>The No. 2 long-distance bus from Xicheng crashed into the river at Bantang Temple in Wuxi due to the wheel axle falling off. More than a dozen people were injured and one old woman drowned. She was Tian Xu, 47 years old, from Yangzhou. Her husband, Tian Baorong, runs a sewing shop at the Diaqiaotu of Shuiximen in Nanjing. Because her son, Jiarui, was helping out at a clothing shop outside Ximen in Nantong, she went to search for him but did not find him. She was already short of travel money, so she went to Xicheng from Jiangyin, which led to her drowning. It is also tragic.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<h3>Change of Chief of Fifth Water District</h3>
<p>Zhao Zeshao, the chief of the Fifth Water Public Security District, submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, requesting to resign. It is heard that it has been approved. The vacancy will be filled by Gong Guoliang, the director of the First Branch of the Narcotics Investigation Office. However, the appointment order has not yet been issued, and it is heard that Gong is scheduled to take over on the 1st.</p>
<h3>Waiter at Hostel Hides Young Girl</h3>
<p>Tan Xinfa, a waiter at the Xin Hostel on Rixin Street, was found to have seduced a female worker from Shaobo named Chen Cainv in the hostel. However, the girl had already been betrothed to Sun Yulong, the son of Sun Ruohai, a fellow villager, and the wedding was scheduled for the twelfth day of the eighth lunar month of this year. Her father, Chen Deyuan, then sent a letter urging his daughter to return home for the wedding. Unexpectedly, Tan repeatedly absconded with the girl. Later, after negotiating with the hostel owner Jiang Mingshan, Tan was sent to the First Branch and then to the Third Bureau. After a preliminary interrogation by officer Ding, Tan knew that it was difficult to deny and agreed in court to hand over the girl within three days before he was released on bail. However, Tan did not hand over the girl by the deadline, so Chen went to the bureau to ask for an investigation. The bureau then summoned both parties to the bureau and transferred them to the court. After the prosecutor questioned them, he ordered Tan to be temporarily released on bail and ordered him to hand over the girl and turn himself in within five days.</p>

<h3>Restoration of the Pujilun Sixi Wharf Service</h3>
<p>The Pujilun ferry has been operating to Zhenjiang Liuxi, Guazhou, Shierxi, Siyuangou, and other wharfs for many years, and passengers have found it convenient. However, during the summer when the Yangtze River tides are high, Liuxi is located on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the tidal waters erode the riverbank from time to time. In order to avoid danger, the ship stopped serving the Shierxi wharf in May of this year. Chen Yufu, the township chief of the township, believed that the river tide has now receded and the bank collapse has subsided, and the number of passengers is increasing day by day, so he sent a letter to the Pujilun Bureau requesting that the Liuxi service be restored immediately to facilitate transportation and benefit merchants.</p>

<p>The case of Guo Chenjiu, the former chief of the West Lake Special Tax Bureau, raping Zhou Zhuoying, the daughter of the late Zhou Guifang, a clerk of the bureau, has been in court since it was reported. Guo died of madness. The Hangzhou Local Court found that the second defendant in the case, Guo Guozhen (Guo Zi) and Jing Guoshi, were both guilty of helping to rape a girl under the age of 20, and sentenced each of them to one year and two months of imprisonment. Guo Guozhen was fined 1,000 yuan and Jing Guoshi was fined 300 yuan. Zhou Zhuoying requested 20,000 yuan in civil damages and the immigration court handled the case. Guo and others were not satisfied and appealed to the High Court. After the trial, the verdict was announced at 2 p.m. yesterday (30th). The original verdict was overturned. Guo Guozhen and Jing Guoshi were both found not guilty. Zhou Zhuoying's incidental civil suit was dismissed. It is heard that Zhou Zhuoying and her mother plan to appeal again.</p>
<h3>Bandit Attempts Kidnapping and is Apprehended</h3>
<p>Ding Youquan, a bandit from Shashaikeng, the border between Xinchang and Shengxian, has repeatedly committed kidnapping and extortion. He was captured by the Xinchang County Government last November. After being released on bail after being a mole to kill the bandit leader Bingxian, Ding fled to Shanghai and hid in the home of Hu Dasan at No. 7 Liushuiqiao, Songmuchi. One day, he met Liang Xiaocai, a fellow villager, and learned that Liang was living in the home of his aunt's husband, Yang Jintang, who was very wealthy and lived at No. 57 Shihuqiao, Xidajie. Yang himself was a battalion commander in the Nanchang Headquarters. Ding suddenly had a bad idea and discussed with Liang to kidnap Yang's three-year-old son, Shiyuan, in order to extort a large sum of money. Ding gave Liang 500 yuan as a reward and ordered him to take the child out, because Liang had previously cooperated with Ding in robberies. Later, Liang returned home, had a change of heart, and reported it to his aunt, who reported it to the police station in charge. Yesterday (30th), the two criminals, Ding and Liang, were arrested and interrogated.</p>

They searched and robbed 564 silver dollars and left. Fu was seriously injured and was sent to the Hushu Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<h3>江東賣蓆橋 Fire</h3>
<p>The Chen Fuxing pastry shop at the rowing alley entrance of Maixi Bridge in Jiangdong, Ningbo, suddenly caught fire at about 2 a.m. this morning (the 29th). The fire blazed intensely, lighting up the sky. Due to the Old Jiang Bridge not being repaired yet, the fire engines from both sides of the Jiang River within the city were unable to reach the scene for rescue. Only the An'an Fire Brigade's fire engine arrived to provide assistance. It took half an hour to extinguish the fire. A total of seven shops, including Lin Shengfa's firewood shop, were affected, with over ten houses burned down, resulting in losses exceeding ten thousand taels of silver.</p>
<h3>Damage from the Typhoon in Zhenhai County</h3>
<p>The coastal towns and villages of Zhenhai County suffered extremely heavy damage from the recent typhoon. After the county magistrate, Xu Yong, personally inspected the affected areas, it was found that about 20% of the county's households, approximately over 30,000 households, were affected. Eight people, including men, women, and children, drowned. Over 300 tiled houses were completely destroyed, and over 1,000 were partially destroyed. Over 1,000 thatched houses were completely destroyed, along with over 100 boats. Thousands of salt pan planks were washed away, and 200,000 to 300,000 catties of salt were lost. Breaches occurred along approximately 200 li of coastal dikes, and over 100,000 mu of cotton fields were flooded. The harvest of crops in the fields was greatly reduced due to the intrusion of saltwater. The total losses are estimated to be over 3 million taels of silver, making it an unprecedented disaster in decades. The county magistrate left for Shanghai yesterday, and Shanghai-based gentry and merchants are raising relief funds to help the disaster-stricken people. Furthermore, in the vicinity of Daishan, Nianmu, Tiebansha, and other places, about 50 to 60 floating corpses have been retrieved in recent days, including both men and women, mostly fishermen from Chongming. The scene is extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>Wang, Sun, Song, Kong, Li, and Others Visited Song Yesterday Morning to Confer on Finance</h3>
<p>Wang Indicates That He Has Discussed Considerable Relief Measures</p>
<p>Standing Committee Members of the Economic Commission to Take Office in Nanjing Next Week</p>
<p>Huang Fu to Go North to His Post Tonight; Mayor Gave Farewell Banquet Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, and others also arrived in Shanghai together from Nanjing at approximately 7:00 a.m. yesterday. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Wang, Sun, Li, and others all went to Qiqi Road to meet with Finance Minister Song Ziwen to discuss central financial issues and the progress of the National Economic Commission. Kong Xiangxi, Governor of the Central Bank, was also present. The meeting dispersed at noon. Afterwards, Wang met with a group of reporters at his residence and stated that concrete results had been achieved in the discussions. Song would return to Nanjing in two or three days, and the National Economic Commission would be established next week. In the afternoon, Wang and Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren visited Huang Fu. Huang has agreed to return to Beijing tonight to take charge of the administration. Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Sun, Li, Gu, and Tang Arrive in Shanghai Together</h3>
<p>Following Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei's arrival in Shanghai the night before last, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Director of Military Training Zhu Peide, Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan, Secretary-General of the Central Standing Committee Ye Chucang, Vice Minister of the Interior Gan Naiguang, Director of the National Health Administration Liu Ruiheng, and Legislative Councilors Ma Chaojun, Chen Jianru, and others all took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai the night before last, arriving at the port at 7:30 a.m. yesterday. Railway Minister Gu Mengyu and Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning by express train, arriving at the port at approximately 2:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Financial Issues Discussed at Song's Residence</h3>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei first went to Song's residence to meet with Finance Minister Song Ziwen. Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke followed at 9:25 a.m. At 9:20 a.m., Central Bank Governor Kong Xiangxi went to Wang's residence on Pushi Road to visit Wang, but Wang had already gone to Song's residence, so Kong drove there to join the meeting. At 11:20 a.m., Central Committee Member Li Shizeng also arrived. Wang, Sun, Song, Kong, Li, and others immediately held a meeting in the living room of Song's residence to conduct a comprehensive discussion on various important issues, including central finances, the reorganization and progress of the National Economic Commission, and the disposition of American cotton and wheat. Wang, Sun, and others left successively at 11:40 a.m. It is heard that after this long discussion, opinions from all parties were unified, and considerable relief measures were also discussed for central finances.</p>
<h3>Jiang Talks About Having Financial Solutions</h3>
<p>After leaving Song's residence at 11:40 a.m., Wang drove to the Wanglu residence on Haige Road to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng, but he was not there, so he left. He then quickly returned to his private residence at 11:50 a.m. and immediately met with a group of reporters, making the following statement: He said that his visit to Shanghai this time was to discuss central financial issues with Minister Song, because the central military and administrative expenses had indeed reached a point of exhaustion. Today (i.e., yesterday) was also the end of the month, and this month's expenses urgently needed to be paid. Therefore, immediately after the Central Political Council meeting, he came to Shanghai to discuss solutions with Minister Song. In addition, they discussed the organization and progress of the National Economic Commission. Those who met at Song's residence this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) included Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Central Bank Governor Kong Xiangxi, Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, and himself. As a result of the discussions, relief measures were discussed for central finances. He was unable to disclose the detailed contents.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Wheat Loans to Be Used for Construction</h3>
<p>Wang also stated that regarding the use of American cotton and wheat loans, it had been declared earlier that they would be used for construction and production projects. Although military and administrative expenses are extremely difficult, they must not be easily diverted. This principle was unanimously advocated during this morning's discussion and must not be changed. As for the finances of North China, Minister Song and Chairman Huang have agreed that they will be directly under the central government's jurisdiction in the future.</p>
<h3>Active Responsibility, Resignation Is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>When reporters asked about the rumors that Minister Song had submitted his resignation and that Chairman Chiang and President Wang himself also had the intention of resigning, inquiring as to the truth, Wang responded that this statement could be proven by the facts. Minister Song advocated using American cotton and wheat loans for construction and production projects, and other committee members also had the same aspirations, without any differences of opinion. Since the views of the various committee members are the same, the rumor that Song became passive due to disagreement is self-defeating. In this time of national crisis, we can only actively take responsibility and strive to save the country and ensure its survival. Wang also said that if anyone can take responsibility for them, they can abdicate at any time, so there is no question of resignation or non-resignation.</p>
<h3>Economic Commission to Be Established Next Week</h3>
<p>The National Economic Commission is scheduled to be established in Nanjing next Wednesday or Thursday. Minister Song is in Shanghai, planning financial matters, and will return to Nanjing in about two or three days to formally take office as a standing committee member of the Economic Commission. As for the Economic Commission, it will be based entirely on assigning personnel to tasks and will not set up institutions first and then assign personnel. For example, cotton industry relief is currently important, so a Cotton Industry Control Committee has been specially established. The rumor of expanding the organization is completely inaccurate. The position of Secretary-General will be held by Qin Fen, director of the preparatory office of the commission. All matters have been handled by him in the past, so he will continue to be hired to leverage his expertise. As for the Construction Committee, it will not be merged for the time being, etc.</p>
<h3>Wang Visits Huang Fu; Huang to Go North Tonight</h3>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Wang drove to Qiqi Road to visit Huang Fu, chairman of the Peace Preservation and Administration Committee, for about two hours. When Wang left, he told a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency that his visit to Huang was to conduct a final consultation on issues such as the finances of North China. After thorough discussions with Huang, they have now been completely agreed upon. Huang has decided to take the Shanghai-Beijing through train back to Beijing from Shanghai at 11:00 p.m. tomorrow night (i.e., tonight) and will not linger in Nanjing, etc. Yesterday afternoon, when President Wang was at Huang's residence, Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren and Railway Minister Gu Mengyu also visited Huang one after another and left after Wang.</p>
<h3>Mayor Hosts Banquet; Returns to Beijing Today</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei at the Municipal Government Reception Center on Xiafei Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Central Bank Governor Kong Xiangxi, Envoy to Japan Jiang Zuobin, Peace Preservation and Administration Committee Chairman Huang Fu, Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, and others were invited to attend. The guests and hosts dispersed in high spirits at about 2:00 p.m. Wang Jingwei is scheduled to return to Nanjing today, and Sun Ke will stay in Shanghai for a while and return to Nanjing in two or three days, it is said.</p>
<h3>Minister to Mexico Huang Yingsu Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Depart Overseas to Assume His New Post as Soon as Arrangements Are Completed</p>
<p>There were originally over 40,000 overseas Chinese in Mexico, most of whom were engaged in agriculture and commerce, and who have made many contributions to Mexico. Therefore, they are highly valued by the Mexican government. Recently, the people of the Shanshan and Suen provinces of Mexico have been affected by the global economic recession, and their businesses have declined. Seeing that the overseas Chinese are engaged in business in these areas, not only are there many of them, but they are also hardworking and able to endure hardship. Therefore, they have been looked upon with resentment by some Mexicans. Some Mexicans believe that their commerce has been encroached upon by the overseas Chinese. Thus, regardless of diplomatic relations, they have organized an anti-Chinese party to implement discrimination, confiscate property, and expel them. It is difficult for the overseas Chinese to gain a foothold, so many have returned to their home country from places such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, accounting for nearly half of them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very concerned about this matter and has collected a large number of documents for reference in negotiations. On the one hand, the government has newly appointed Huang Yingsu as the minister to Mexico to take charge. Huang went to Nanjing from Shanghai the day before yesterday to pay his respects to Wang Jingwei, who is both the Executive Yuan President and Foreign Minister, to ask for instructions on the policies to be adopted after going to Mexico and to prepare the credentials and handle passport procedures. All matters have been completed. He returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. It is heard that Huang is taking care of personal matters in Shanghai. As soon as the arrangements are completed, he plans to depart overseas to assume his new post in Mexico in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Belgian Envoy Guillaume Arrives Back in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Paying His Respects to Executive Yuan President and Acting Foreign Minister Wang Jingwei, the Minister to China from Belgium, Guillaume, Completed His Business the Night Before Last. He and His Wife Took the Beijing-Shanghai Night Express to Shanghai, Arriving at the Port at About 8:00 a.m. Yesterday. He Immediately Went to the Belgian Embassy Office on Lafayette Road to Rest. It Is Heard That the Belgian Envoy's Visit to Nanjing Was Solely to Pay His Respects to Wang, Who Is Serving as Acting Foreign Minister, and There Were No Other Missions. This Action Was an Expected Diplomatic Move by Various Envoys Since Wang Became Acting Foreign Minister.</p>
<h3>Dismantling of Cross-Border Telephones Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>Pudong Postponed for Now</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in accordance with the provisional contract signed with the Shanghai Telephone Company, began dismantling cross-border telephones yesterday and is actively preparing to establish the Pudong Branch. However, the cross-border telephones in Pudong will be dismantled only after the branch is established. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dismantling Begins: The Shanghai Telephone Company installed a total of 288 cross-border telephones in Zhabei, Nanshi, Pudong, Longhua, Huxi, and other places. After the Shanghai Telephone Bureau announced the dismantling of cross-border telephones, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the engineering department dispatched mechanics to Nanshi and Zhabei to dismantle the telephone lines of businesses that had first requested the removal of cross-border telephones. There were seven in Nanshi and six in Zhabei. As for the remaining cross-border telephones in Nanshi, Zhabei, Longhua, Huxi, and other places, mechanics will be dispatched again starting today to continue dismantling them. However, the cross-border telephones of the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus, as well as the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Garrison Headquarters, will be dismantled only after all the cross-border telephones of businesses and factories have been completely dismantled.</p>
<p>Pudong Postponed: There are a total of 77 cross-border telephones in Pudong. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau is actively proceeding with the preparation and installation of the Pudong Telephone Branch. The telephone lines of the bureau will be implemented after the branch is established. Therefore, in order to facilitate telephone communication between businesses, factories, and wharves in Pudong, the cross-border telephones in Pudong will be temporarily suspended from dismantling. The Pudong Branch is scheduled to be established in early November. Fifty pairs of lines leading to Pudong will be added at Gaochang Temple to prepare for the installation of telephones in Pudong.</p>
<h3>First Batch of American Cotton Began to Be Unloaded Yesterday</h3>
<p>11,350 Pieces</p>
<p>All Unloaded into China Merchants' Wharf</p>
<p>The first batch of American cotton purchased by China through American loans, which arrived on the American vessel "Aisanya Alan," has been unloaded at the China Merchants' Wharf in Pudong. Yesterday, workers were dispatched from the dock to lift the cotton from the ship using cranes and store it in the warehouses. The number of pieces of cotton unloaded into the warehouse was 11,350, as stated on the ship's manifest, and all were unloaded and stacked in various warehouses in China Merchants' Wharf without being stored elsewhere. The previous report that only 4,500 pieces remained in the China Merchants' Wharf was a misreport. The actual number of pieces in the warehouse is indeed 11,350 bales, as previously reported by this newspaper. After being stacked in the warehouse, the future unloading issue, as learned by reporters, will be handled by buyers at any time, at their convenience, without any restrictions on the storage period. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance is fully responsible for the goods upon arrival at the warehouse. Once sold, the government will no longer be responsible for any issues until the goods are unloaded from the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Members of the Provisional Municipal Council Resign En Masse</h3>
<p>Discussing the Municipal Budget and Disaster Area Reconstruction Plan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held its Fourth Meeting of the Second Regular Session the day before yesterday. Councilors Shi Liangcai, Chen Bingqian, Guo Shun, Qin Runqing, Xu Yongzuo, Du Yuesheng, Tao Baichuan, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, and others were present, constituting a quorum. Chairman Shi Liangcai announced the opening of the meeting and gave a report, followed by the discussion of agenda items. The following are some of the important cases:</p>
<h3>Municipal Budget</h3>
<p>Regarding the municipal revenue and expenditure budget for this year (1933), after being reviewed by the Municipal Government, the Council considered the budget to be of great importance and specially formed a budget review committee. However, since there were no financial statements from the previous year for comparison, it was difficult to review whether the created budget was suitable for the actual revenue and expenditure situation. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Municipal Government, requesting that the financial statements be sent to the Council as soon as possible. In response, the Municipal Government sent a letter stating that although the budget for 1931 had been approved by the Central Government, there had been changes due to war. The budget for 1932 had only recently been approved. Therefore, a considerable amount of time was required to compile the financial statements for each year. As a result of the budget review committee meeting, the following opinions were put forward: (A) Regarding the ordinary budget: (1) It was found that the new income for 1933, excluding the land price tax of 1.5 million yuan and the Shatien government property income of 300,000 yuan, totaling 1.8 million yuan, the remaining tax revenues all had the possibility of gradual increase. However, without the actual income figures from the previous year or the year before for reference, it was difficult to review whether these planned figures were for the purpose of increasing revenue due to inflated expenditures. (2) Expenditures for various expenses in 1933 have increased. Apart from debt expenses due to special circumstances, are there any concrete plans for the various projects that should be carried out this year? Based on the superficial view of the proposed estimates, apart from public security expenses due to the approved additional budget, if other expenses such as those that can be separately slowed down and reduced can be separately tightened, then public funds can be saved from being wasted. (3) In order to prevent revenue shortages and to ensure that the budget revenue and expenditure are suitable, expenditures should be reduced and the income from new revenue items should be used to prepare for municipal prosperity reserve funds. It would be appropriate to increase the amount in proportion to ensure the safety of the city's financial operations. (B) Regarding the operating budget: (1) It was found that the pure profit income of the city's bank was not listed in either the ordinary budget or the operating budget. The reason for this is unknown. 2. The budget deficit of 286,920 yuan in 1933 should be planned and compensated for in some way, but this was not mentioned. After yesterday's meeting, it was decided that since the financial statements for 1931 and 1932 had special circumstances and had not yet been compiled, the actual revenue and expenditure of the Municipal Government and its affiliated agencies in that year should have records that could be checked. Therefore, the Municipal Government was still requested to send the actual revenue and expenditure records for those two years to the Council as soon as possible for budget review.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Council considered its greatest tasks to be (1) reviewing budgets and financial statements and (2) rebuilding disaster areas. The former is related to the burden on citizens and whether the use of funds is appropriate, and it is also related to the rise and fall of municipal administration. The latter, rebuilding the war zones, is to revitalize the city's appearance and also to seek welfare for the citizens. However, the issuance of reconstruction bonds was before the establishment of the Council, and the Council should supervise the use of the reconstruction bonds after the fact. Therefore, immediately after its establishment, it sent a letter to the Municipal Government, requesting that the entire case of the issuance of reconstruction bonds be sent to the Council. Because the matter was important, a disaster area reconstruction team was specially set up to handle it. After reviewing the case, the team found that, according to the original plan, the Municipal Government had transferred 37.49% of the funds for other uses, that is, 800,000 yuan for building public houses in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong, for building municipal government and bureau buildings in the city center, and 1 million yuan earmarked for lending to small business owners in war zones such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong to rebuild their houses, for the Municipal Government to open a trust department. According to the recent income and expenditure statement of the Shanghai Reconstruction Bonds distributed by the Municipal Government representatives at the meeting at that time, the actual expenditure for repairing bridges and roads in the war zones of Zhabei, Wusong, and Jiangwan was only 50,000 yuan, which was only 1/20 of the quota of 1 million yuan. It can be seen from this whether or not efforts have been made for reconstruction work. Immediately afterward, the Municipal Government was asked to quickly explain what it would do for the disaster area reconstruction project, and to send the entire implementation plan and remedial measures to the Council for discussion. The Municipal Government replied that transferring the funds for building public houses in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other districts to build municipal government buildings in the city center was not a change of purpose. Furthermore, increasing the capital of the Municipal Bank to start a trust business was originally to meet the needs of small business owners and others in the disaster areas after the war to borrow money to rebuild houses, which was part of the post-war relief efforts. As for the engineering aspects, the ditches in Wusong and Jiangwan districts have been completed, and 80% of the roads have been completed. In the Zhabei district, in addition to Jiaotong Road, bridges such as Qingyun Bridge, Tiantong'an Bridge, Qiujiang Road Bridge, and Bazhi Bridge have all been completed. The restoration of the embankment on Guangfu Road, as well as the Linping Road Bridge and Tiantong Road Bridge in the Yinxiang district, have also been completed. It was heard that at the meeting, the disaster area reconstruction team believed that what was recovered was still not satisfactory. The main points were: (1) The Municipal Government's expenses for building houses and other expenses have already reached 500,000 yuan in municipal bonds, which must have been used for the purpose for which they were originally designated. If it is intended to increase embellishments, resulting in a lack of funds, then without the fundraising of reconstruction bonds, will the Municipal Government issue new bonds to complete this construction? (2) The canals for roads in the city center have been entirely borne by the households in the concession area, otherwise the land that was confiscated at a penalty of several hundred yuan will be requisitioned for several thousand yuan. (3) The Municipal Government's use of a huge sum of 1.3 million yuan to build the Municipal Government and bureau buildings in the city center raises the question of whether the post-disaster construction projects in the disaster areas are not more urgent than this. As for transferring the loans for rebuilding houses destroyed by small business owners in Zhabei and Jiangwan to the trust department, it should also be listed as a loan entrusted to the Municipal Bank and should not be listed as adding capital to the Municipal Bank. Furthermore, it should be specified whether it was designated at the time of allocation, whether a public announcement was made, when it started to be handled, and what the results of the handling were. Also, the work of tidying up roads and ditches in the disaster areas should be carried out in accordance with the original plan, and the extent of the work should be clarified. Even without the occurrence of disasters, roads, bridges, and ditches would have to be repaired and tidied up every year, so the Municipal Government is still asked to give a detailed reply to share the information with the citizens. All of this was passed at the meeting and forwarded to the Municipal Government for verification and reply.</p>
<h3>General Resignation</h3>
<p>The Provisional Municipal Council of this city was established on October 16 of last year. According to the provisions of Article 3 of the Council's Organizational Regulations, its term of office should last until the establishment of the Municipal Council (i.e., the elected one). However, the councilors believed that the term of office should be limited, so at the time of the inaugural meeting, they themselves declared that it would be for one year. Now it is about to expire, so at yesterday's meeting, a motion was made for general resignation, which was unanimously agreed upon by all present. In addition, several other cases were discussed, such as the referral of the land price tax case for review and the revision of the regulations of the Security Committee.</p>

<h3>After Power Workers' Strike, They Petitioned the Municipal Council Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Company Strictly Refused Workers' Entry</p>
<p>Party and Government Sent Personnel to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Fei Xindun Is Scheduled to Reply Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Electrical Workers' Union Discussed How to Respond</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that since the Shanghai Electric Power Company's Yangshupu New Plant dismissed three workers without cause the day before yesterday and refused to pay pension benefits, more than a thousand workers have gone on strike. The strike continued yesterday afternoon, but workers at the Feilun Road Old Plant have not yet joined. In the afternoon, since Saturday is normally a day of rest, all the workers went to the Municipal Council to petition at noon. As a result, they were promised a response tomorrow morning (Monday). The Party and Government have sent special commissioners to investigate the truth. The police have taken special precautions. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Refusing Entry and Demanding Pension Benefits</h3>
<p>Workers at the Electric Power Company's New Plant went to the plant as usual at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, but the company had secretly deployed a large number of detectives beforehand and refused to issue badges, so more than a thousand workers could not enter. The workers believed that the company was terminating the work of all the workers, so they went to the office to negotiate. At 8:30 a.m., they went to the main office of the Electric Power Company at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road to demand pension benefits and put forward five people, including Zhang Changsheng, to request an audience with General Manager Elte, but they were refused. Seeing that their goal was not achieved, the workers gathered and did not disperse. The Public Concession Police had been informed in advance and, fearing trouble, dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to monitor the scene. When the workers went to the office in a group to demand pension benefits, four of the workers came by bicycle. Due to an accidental collision with a rickshaw, the detectives there detained them in the police station under the pretext of fear of trouble. They were only released at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<h3>Petitioning the Municipal Council En Masse</h3>
<p>At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, about a thousand workers from the New Plant in Yangshupu set off for the Municipal Council on Sima Road, intending to petition General Manager Fei Xindun. They arrived at their destination at 12:00 noon. More than a thousand workers stood around Jiangxi Road in front of the bureau. Due to the large number of people, many workers also went to stand on the land in front of the American church opposite. Four representatives from the workers' side, Zhang Changsheng, Zhu Afu, Zhu Haosen, and Bao Defu, went inside to seek an audience with General Manager Fei Xindun. General Manager Fei, together with Counselor He Deji, personally received them. The representatives then stated that the company authorities had handled things inappropriately and dismissed workers without cause, and requested assistance to negotiate on their behalf. As a result, Fei agreed to go to the company yesterday afternoon to consult with General Manager Elte and to encourage an early solution. He also ordered the workers to maintain order and to send representatives to the bureau at 9:00 a.m. on Monday to await a reply. Thereupon the workers withdrew.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Investigate the Truth of the Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Since accepting the workers' petition on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters dispatched Zhu Jintao from the Third Section and Dai Yongchan from the Municipal Party Headquarters to investigate the truth of the labor dispute yesterday morning. They first went to the main office at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road to meet with General Manager Elte to inquire about everything. Then they went to the Fourth District Electrical Workers' Union on Tiantong Road to ask the standing committee members about the truth, so that they could make a report and the Party and Government could discuss solutions. It is heard that a mediation will be conducted on Monday.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Group Leaders at the Old Factory Responds</h3>
<p>The Water and Electricity Workers' Union of the Four Districts, due to the Shanghai Electric Power Company's New Factory dismissing workers and then refusing to pay pension funds, resulting in a general slowdown, is now refusing workers entry to the factory. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold a meeting of group leaders at 3:00 PM at the Tiantong Road Clubhouse to discuss countermeasures. It is heard that workers at the old factory, if the company insists on not allowing workers to enter or leave the factory, will also stage a walkout starting on Monday to support the workers and decide to collect severance pay and disband.</p>
<h3>Company Announcement: All Dismissed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a notice was posted at the side gate of the Shanghai Electric Power Company at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road. It stated, roughly, that former employees of the Yangshupu New Factory are scheduled to receive their wages on October 3rd in the factory's sign room, and they may go there to collect them at that time.</p>
<h3>Company Report: Reasons Given</h3>
<p>Yesterday, regarding the labor unrest, the company issued a statement in English to various newspapers explaining the reasons for this incident. After 8:00 PM on Friday, the power plant workers suddenly announced a strike without prior notice to the company for any consultation. The company was greatly shocked because the company serves society and has a heavy responsibility and is very willing to consult with its employees. However, since no requirements were heard in advance, and no workers requested contact, the company knew nothing until the workers went on strike. What is the purpose of the strike, and why did the workers resort to this tactic? The company believes that it has a great responsibility to society and workers and is deeply concerned. Therefore, it advised the workers not to rashly strike, which would endanger the lives of countless workers who rely on the electricity industry. Moreover, this strike was carried out without any procedure. The company believes that this action shows that the workers are ignorant of the facts and lack a sense of responsibility to the public, resulting in this unfortunate incident.</p>
<h3>Capital's Side Indicates Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Guomin News Agency, considering the importance of the power workers' strike and its impact on public safety, specifically visited Mr. Eltert, the vice president of the company, to inquire about the company's policy for dealing with the labor unrest. He was received and informed of everything in detail. According to the conversation, the company was quite surprised by the sudden strike of the workers at the new factory because the workers had not given any notice in advance, nor had they sent official representatives to discuss the matter. Therefore, the company did not know the reasons for the strike. The number of strikers today is the same as yesterday, with more than 500 workers from the new factory, all from the coppersmithing and repair departments, having no impact on power generation. As for the company's countermeasures, they are currently under negotiation and have not yet been determined. It is rumored that the company is hiring White Russian workers to replace the striking workers, which is not true. However, there were originally a small number of White Russian workers, and their number has not increased since the strike occurred.</p>
<h3>Police Precaution: Extraordinarily Strict</h3>
<p>The police are paying close attention to this matter. In addition to stationing a large number of armed detectives, about a hundred, at the Yangshupu New Factory, the old factory on Feilun Road has also strengthened its defenses. More than ten Chinese and Western detectives have also been dispatched to the company's office on Nanjing Road, standing guard near the front and back side doors to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Today is Sunday: Workers Rest</h3>
<p>Today is Sunday, and the company's office and its affiliated new and old factories are closed as usual. Workers do not enter the factory, so there will definitely be no development in the labor unrest today, and no accidents will occur. Tomorrow is Monday, and the result of the Municipal Council's consultation with the company will be answered. If the workers find it satisfactory, the labor unrest can be resolved. However, in case of a decisive break, the old factory may also join the slowdown to provide assistance. As for the electricity supply, the capital side claims that there is absolutely no problem.</p>
<h3>Kaicheng Factory Requests Relief to Save Domestic Sulfuric Acid</h3>
<h3>from the Danger of Foreign Goods Dumping</h3>
<p>Shanghai Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Co., Ltd. submitted a document to Chairman Chiang and the ministries, stating that it is a domestic sulfuric acid manufacturing factory suffering from the pressure of foreign goods dumping and is on the verge of collapse. It earnestly requests urgent relief to maintain domestic production and strengthen the national economy. The memorandum states that acid production is a basic chemical industry, just as iron production is a basic mechanical industry. If acids cannot be produced domestically, then all acid raw materials required by the chemical industry will inevitably depend on foreigners. This will not only result in a huge leakage of wealth, but if foreigners were to cut off their supply, all chemical industries, even military industries, would be destroyed. Its impact on national survival is indeed significant. With this in mind, the merchants were approved by the two ministries of military and political industry in the nineteenth year to raise funds to organize the Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Co., Ltd. After experiencing repeated incidents, we have been operating painstakingly for three years, and only this spring were we able to ship goods. According to the current equipment, 15 tons of sulfuric acid can be produced daily, about 5,000 tons per year, equivalent to about 84,000 piculs, which, according to the statistics of customs imports over the years, is sufficient to meet the needs of the whole country. However, since this spring, due to the dumping of foreign goods, the market price has plummeted from 17 taels of silver per 200-pound box to 10 taels. Since then, Japanese goods have become even more intensified and dumped on a large scale. If delivered at the Shanghai docks, the price is reduced to 7.5 yuan in Japanese gold, plus tariffs and passport fees, the total is less than half of the previous price. Under this situation, the merchant factory had no choice but to reduce production, which resulted in higher production costs and made it more difficult to compete with foreign goods. The merchants cannot bear to see this unique merchant-run sulfuric acid factory to decline. Therefore, we are compelled to report the facts and request your Excellency to examine and approve emergency relief. The relief methods are analyzed and presented to your Excellency as follows: (1) It is proposed that the government provide subsidies to relieve the urgent difficulties of the merchant factory. The governments of all countries adopt subsidy methods for industries related to national strength, subsidizing a certain amount each year to protect them. Our country's industry is in its infancy, and it wants to compete with foreign goods that have strong capital, superb technology, and political power, and non-economic dumping. If the government does not provide special subsidies, its failure is inevitable. Therefore, the merchant factory proposes that your Excellency consult with the Executive Yuan and order the Ministry of Finance to provide a subsidy of 100,000 yuan per year for two years so that the capital can be consolidated and development can be expected. (2) It is proposed that the government exempt tariffs and reduce the freight of state-run sea and land transportation agencies to reduce the burden on merchant factories. The Basic Industry Incentive Law promulgated by the government has provisions for exempting export and re-export tariffs on equipment and raw materials, and reducing the freight of state-run sea and land transportation agencies. The merchant factory has previously submitted an application to the relevant ministries in accordance with the law and has been approved to do so, but it has not yet been approved. Now that the merchant factory is facing a critical situation due to the oppression of foreign goods, it can only request your Excellency to consult with the Executive Yuan and order the relevant ministries to exempt tariffs and reduce freight so that the merchant factory can survive. (3) It is proposed that the government increase the import tax on foreign sulfuric acid to avoid the harm of dumping. In order to protect their industries, all countries have built high tariff barriers to restrict or prevent the intrusion of foreign goods. According to the statistics of the total number of sulfuric acid imports in the Republic of China in the 21st year, excluding military tax exemptions, there are about 50,000 piculs. The official tax is 5.5 jiao of customs gold per picul, which is 7.05% of the ad valorem tax. The tax rate is unparalleled. We earnestly request your Excellency to consult with the Executive Yuan and order the Ministry of Finance to specially increase the import tax on sulfuric acid, at least to 1.65 yuan of official customs gold per picul, which is sufficient to prevent the harm of dumping. (4) It is proposed that the government control the import of foreign goods, protect the domestic market, and enable domestic factories to develop independently. Controlled economy has been adopted by countries all over the world, and our country cannot be an exception. Therefore, on the one hand, the annual import quantity of sulfuric acid should be controlled by the government. Applications for import passports for foreign sulfuric acid beyond a certain quantity should be strictly rejected. At the same time, the government should strictly order educational institutions, military institutions, and even agricultural and industrial experimental farms to purchase domestic sulfuric acid. In this way, domestic goods can retain the domestic market. The above are all indispensable methods of relief. We implore your Excellency to consider the danger of national industry and promote the development of military industry, and approve its implementation. It is not only the fortune of the merchant factory, but also the future of the country and the nation will benefit from it.</p>
<h3>Wang Yizhe Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Northeast General Wang Yizhe came to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday to discuss important official matters. He did not stop in Beijing. Therefore, he sent a telegram of thanks to the various circles in Beijing who were preparing a welcome meeting. The original telegram is as follows: Respectfully to Mr. Deng Xiyuan and Mr. Liu Daoxing in Nanjing: I have received your telegram with respect. I will go to Shanghai in the next few days and will not stop in Beijing. I am ashamed and dare not accept the welcome from all circles. Please decline on my behalf first. I will pay my respects again after I transfer to Beijing. Wang Yizhe Yan. It is heard that Mr. Wang has arrived in Shanghai yesterday and immediately visited the leaders of the military, political, and business circles in the city to discuss important official matters.</p>
<h3>Two Shipping Companies Request Equal Treatment for State-Run and Private Shipping Industries</h3>
<p>Shanghai Hezhong Shipping Company and Dazhen Shipping Company sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, stating: We saw in the Shen Bao on September 24th that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Longhai Railway Bureau signed a contract for sea-land cargo intermodal transport, which will be implemented on October 1st. After reading this news, our companies were greatly frightened. Haizhou belongs to Donghai County in Jiangsu Province and is the only port of Linhong Port, and the eastern terminal of the Longhai Railway. All products from Gansu, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Henan, and other provinces are loaded on ships there and transferred to various ports. In the past, the domestic steamships were reluctant to go forward because the area was remote and full of bandits. Only one or two foreign ships were there. The passengers and cargo of Longhai Railway were also transferred from Xuzhou to Jinpu, and then to Pukou, and then to Shanghai. Not only was the transportation procedure very difficult, but the transfer time was also extremely long, so merchants regarded it as a scourge. With this in mind, our companies resolutely pooled funds and successively established Hezhong Shipping Company and Dazhen Shipping Company, specializing in the Dapukou to Shanghai route. Hezhong Company first purchased the Haizhou, Zhengzhou, and Xuzhou steamships. Dazhen Company followed suit, measuring the waterway of Dapukou Port, building two new diesel steamships, Yongping and Yongan, and adding Yongji, sailing on a regular basis. Furthermore, because the docks and warehouses of the Longhai Railway had been in disrepair for many years, and the goods were piled up in the open air, resulting in too much loss, we also purchased land, dredged mud, and built docks and steel-concrete warehouses at the mouth of Dapukou, so that loading and unloading were convenient, and the goods were well protected. Passengers praised each other, and sea transport gradually developed. From this point alone, it is enough to prove that without the painstaking efforts of our companies, the cargo transport of the Longhai Railway would never have been so developed today. Even if it were developed today, its shipping rights would have been monopolized by foreign merchants long ago, and it may not have allowed Chinese merchants to intervene. Over the years, our companies have suffered great losses because the business on this route is light from May to September every year. The ships can only load coal to supplement their income. This year, even the small amount of coal has disappeared. However, in order to maintain the shipping line on this route, our companies still dispatch steamships as usual, even though they are losing money every day. Unlike the wild steamships, when there are prosperous months, they compete to open steamships, even more than a dozen steamships, lowering the freight and engaging in competition. By the time it is a light month, they change to other ports. Even in the case of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, although it is the earliest steamship company in our country, it has never sailed long-distance services to that port, but only occasionally dispatches one or two steamships during prosperous months to engage in competition. Moreover, the steamships dispatched are all entrusted to other companies as agents, and no branch offices are set up in that port. Think about it, our companies must maintain normal operations when there is little cargo, and we cannot exclusively occupy the advantage when there is a lot of cargo. The fact that there are more losses than profits in our business over the years can be seen generally. The reason why our companies operate painstakingly and support themselves is nothing more than to circulate inland production and prevent foreign steamships from intruding. Last year, the Ministry of Railways issued a notice to all railways to implement intermodal transport. The Longhai Railway Bureau first contacted our companies for sea-land intermodal transport, and everything was ready. Our companies were also fully prepared and waiting to implement it. Now, suddenly there is a saying that the Bureau has independently signed a intermodal transport contract with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. If this news is true, will our companies' business not be plunged into desperation? The steamships, docks, and warehouses of our companies are specially set up for opening up the shipping line on this route, and the investment is very large. In addition, the losses over the years are not small. If the shipping of this route is exclusively contracted to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, then what business can our companies do? Foreign steamship companies often have discounts, and the government still has subsidies. Now our authorities are actually using state-run steamship companies to exclusively handle shipping, wiping out the merchant-run shipping industry. It is not reasonable to evaluate it, and it does not seem to be a fair approach to the government's aim to protect the shipping industry. For the sake of the future of our business and the livelihood of the sailors, we have to fight for it with the Railway Bureau. If the statement that the Bureau signed a contract with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has indeed been signed, please cancel it quickly. If it has not been signed, please stop it so that state-run and private shipping industries can jointly load and receive the same treatment, and seek development for the route. It is very much hoped. We dare to state everything together and humbly request that the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association forward it to the Railway Department and the Ministry of Communications of the Executive Yuan to sympathize with the merchants' difficulties and approve our request. We would be extremely fortunate. Respectfully to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, Hezhong Shipping Company, and Dazhen Shipping Company.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Held Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Income Gradually Increases...Losses Decrease</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation held its fourth annual shareholders meeting at the company on Guangdong Road at 3 pm yesterday. Chinese representatives present were Huang Jiangquan, Dai Enji, Wang Xianhua, and Nie Kaiyi. American representatives present were Bispei, Band, and Newlett. The managing director reported on the business situation, stating that the company's business losses for the one year from July 1, 1932, to June 30, 1933, totaled 484,933.24 yuan. The total business losses for the three years since the start of business were 1,011,157.05 yuan in the first year, 955,319.97 yuan in the second year, and 484,933.24 yuan in the third year, totaling 2,451,410.26 yuan. However, the company's revenue in the third year increased by 261,073.70 yuan compared with the previous year, and expenses were reduced by 234,285.63 yuan. The Shanghai-Beiping air route was opened on January 10 this year, with three flights per week. As of June 30, its income was only 40,099.15 yuan. During this period, the Ministry of Transportation allocated 98,500.00 yuan to the company to make up for the losses, for which the company should be grateful. In April this year, American United Airlines purchased the ownership of China Airways from Continental Airlines, and 45 percent of the company's shares are owned by China Airways. The company's aviation mileage has greatly increased due to the opening of the Shanghai-Beiping line. In the second half of the 21st year, only 215,274 miles were flown, and in the first half of the 22nd year, 288,698 miles were flown, an increase of 73,424 miles. As for the number of mail items carried, it decreased by 14.5 percent in the first half of the 22nd year due to the increase in postage, but the income increased by 14.5 percent. Although the average increase rate of postal revenue in these six months was only 14.5 percent, the postal revenue in June of this year increased by 24 percent compared with the average monthly revenue in the second half of the 21st year, which shows that although all industries are currently in decline and trade is sluggish, the company's revenue is increasing month by month. It is expected that the business will increase greatly and the expenses will be reduced after the shareholders agree to purchase faster new aircraft. The invested capital can finally be rewarded. The business statistics are listed below:</p>
<p>Flight Mileage Passenger Mileage Mail Pounds</p>
<p>July of the 19th year to 367,441 miles 773,911 miles 56,740 pounds</p>
<p>June of the 20th year</p>
<p>July of the 20th year to 460,383 miles 689,423 miles 97,166 pounds</p>
<p>June of the 21st year</p>
<p>July of the 21st year to 503,972 miles 758,796 miles 108,158 pounds</p>
<p>June of the 22nd year</p>
<h3>The Claims Association Clashed with Detectives Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two Women Injured</p>
<p>The Indemnity Association of the Disaster Area of our Ministry has twice resulted in tragedy due to claiming indemnity from insurance companies, but both have not been resolved. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. At 10 am yesterday, a team of more than 200 people, led by committee members Wang Zhixiang and Ma Rugen, went to Howang Insurance Company on Guangxi Road to claim compensation. However, the insurance companies had already resolved not to recognize the compensation at the Huashang Insurance Company Association the night before, so they politely rejected the claims representatives. Since the claims members could not get what they wanted, and they thought that the instigator was the Huashang Insurance Company Association, they turned to the Huashang Insurance Company Association at No. 38 Aidoa Road to negotiate. The representatives of the association stated the reasons for not recognizing the compensation, but the claims members still insisted that the insurance companies must pay compensation. The two sides held each other for a long time. The members of the Indemnity Association were determined not to stop until they reached their goal and stayed in the association. For a time, the traffic at the gate was blocked, and onlookers gathered. Yang, the representative of the Insurance Association, seeing that the situation was not good, called the Public Concession Police at 3 pm and sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to carry out the expulsion. The insurance policyholders refused to disperse. The detectives repeatedly expelled them without success, so they used force to suppress them, and a small disturbance occurred. As a result, two female policyholders, Yu Jin (68 years old) and Yao Chen (37 years old), were injured and immediately sent by car to the Red Cross Branch on Xinzha Road for treatment. The rest of the people did not disperse automatically until dusk and agreed to go to Huashang to claim compensation again tomorrow. It is heard that the injuries of the two injured women are quite serious.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Allocated Relief Clothing to Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Province has suffered from drought for years, and the number of disaster victims is increasing day by day. The Shanghai Chinese Red Cross recently responded to the request of General Zhu Ziqiao to appeal for the orphanage in the province and allocated 60 boxes of lined relief clothing, totaling more than 10,000 pieces. General Zhu and Yang Hucheng, the Director of the Pacification of the province, had agreed on the transportation method in advance. The Beijing Office of the Shaanxi Pacification Commissioner's Office has sent personnel to contact the Red Cross and requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to transport the relief clothing to Beijing free of charge and hand it over to the Beijing Office of the Shaanxi Pacification Commissioner's Office, which will then be responsible for the westward transportation.</p>

<h3>Detailed Report on the Severity of the Henan Disaster Received by the Jiseihui Society</h3>
<p>The China Jiseihui Society recently received a report from the Henan Disaster Relief Association in Beijing, stating that Henan province is unfortunately plagued by war and natural disasters every year. The people are displaced, and their hearts are weary. This year began with drought, followed by severe locust plagues, and recently, the Yellow River surged suddenly, with the water level rising more than ten feet higher than usual. It carried mud and sand, rushing forward fiercely. Once it overflowed, due to the breach of the Changyuan levee in Huaxian County, the water poured into the area, submerging up to four hundred villages and causing losses of thirty million. The entire county was turned into a watery realm, with no crops remaining. The water from the Yellow River in Yucheng County entered from the border of Cao County, surging and vast, reaching depths of over ten feet and widths of over two miles. Farmlands and houses were almost entirely washed away, with incalculable damage. In Wenxian County, the river rose, and the dikes overflowed, causing floods that spread over ten miles. Homeless victims were scattered everywhere. Other areas such as Lingbao, Shaanxi, Mianchi, Mengjin, Xin'an, Gongxian, Wuzhi, Sishui, Lanfeng, Minquan, Kaocheng, Shangqiu, Fengqiu, Guangwu, Zhengxian, Zhongmu, Kaifeng, Chenliu, Anyang, Linzhang, Mengxian, Kangwu, Jiyuan, and Qinyang Counties also suffered severe damage due to the Yellow River overflowing. It is estimated that over two thousand villages and towns have been affected. In some county towns, the floodwaters surged suddenly, destroying documents. In other areas, entire villages were washed away, leaving no trace. The disaster is extremely severe, unprecedented in history. Helpless people are everywhere, with no hope of a harvest. The dead are gone, while the living, either supporting the elderly and carrying the young, perch atop roofs, or, having lost their children and spouses, cling to trees alone. The sound of weeping fills the wilderness, a scene too horrible to bear. This is a historical catastrophe and a rare human tragedy. Those who see it are horrified, and those who hear of it are heartbroken. However, the disaster area is too vast, and there are too many victims. All shelters and relief supplies are insufficient without massive funds. It is difficult to provide effective relief. A cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood is truly futile. Soon autumn will end, and winter will arrive, bringing fierce winds and heavy snow. Lacking both clothing and food, how can they survive? Thinking of the future is chilling. It is hoped that the entire nation will show compassion, use drawings of displaced people, and appeal for help, extensively providing relief to save these survivors. They will be grateful for the immense kindness. The report indicates the disaster is extremely serious, affecting nearly thirty counties, with those suffering less severely not even included. These dozens of counties are already like hell on earth. They seek death but cannot find it and cry to heaven but receive no response, with no way out. Alas, it is a tragedy. Though we appeal to various charitable organizations, how can they have such great power to provide relief? Fellow countrymen at home and abroad, quickly take off your clothes and share your food, saving these disaster-stricken people who are barely alive and cannot survive long. Though their voices are hoarse from crying, they still cling to a final breath, waiting to be saved.</p>
<h3>Lu Swastika Society Prepares for Winter Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Southeast General Headquarters of the World Red Swastika Society received a letter from the Jinan Red Swastika Society, reporting on the detailed plans for preparing winter relief. We are now excerpting it as follows: "Esteemed Sirs, due to the recent floods in Shandong Province, our society, as is its duty, dispatched teams to provide rescue. The Swastika General Headquarters and the Yantai and Qingdao branches also sent eight teams to Shandong to provide relief. The Wuxi-Changzhou Swastika Society also continued to provide emergency relief. The Shanghai Red Swastika Society also sent teams to Shandong to provide rescue. In total, various parties have raised funds of approximately 170,000 to 180,000 yuan. Government relief has also released hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, the emergency relief period has now passed, and hundreds of thousands of victims in over ten counties are exposed to the elements. With the sharp autumn winds, how can they endure? Moreover, winter is approaching, and it is necessary to prepare cotton clothing and establish soup kitchens to truly save people. Our society has telegraphed various parties to discuss winter relief. We plan to raise 100,000 yuan to start the winter clothing and soup kitchen projects so that hundreds of thousands of victims will not die of cold and hunger. However, the area is vast, and the disaster is severe. We hope that the Red Swastika Societies and charitable organizations will continue to work hard and actively raise funds to help. We are enclosing over ten photos of the disaster area, showing victims naked, exposed to the elements, or in a sea of water. The tragic situation is heartbreaking to hear and painful to see."</p>
<h3>Mr. Danbo of Japan Conserves by Reducing Expenses to Donate to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Donating Three Thousand Yuan Accumulated Over the Years</p>
<p>Sent Yesterday to the Charity Relief Association for Distribution</p>
<p>A person claiming to be Mr. Danbo of Japan came to the Renji Hall Charity Relief Association yesterday afternoon with three thousand yuan in banknotes and a note, saying that he wanted the money to be used for disaster relief to help the victims. The association staff asked for his current address to send a thank-you letter, but he firmly refused to disclose it. The association issued a receipt, and he left. People like Mr. Danbo are truly admirable. The note is transcribed below: "The Yellow River breach has affected six provinces, and millions of victims are suffering. I have a compassionate heart but lack the power to help. Now, I am donating three thousand yuan, saved over the years by reducing expenses, to be used for disaster relief in the six provinces. I ask that the esteemed gentlemen distributing the funds carefully consider how to allocate the money practically and without wasting it. I trust this is done. Sincerely, Mr. Danbo."</p>

<h3>British and French Detectives Jointly Ambush Robbers at Luzon Road, Killing One</h3>
<p>Yuanji Draft Bank Received Payment</p>
<p>Four Robbers Broke In and Stole Everything</p>
<p>-Three Robbers Escaped, One Killed, Stray Bullet Hits Passerby-</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuang, a Ningbo native, lives at 35 Fuming Village, Foch Road, in the Public Concession. He is in the financial business. He set up the Yuanji Draft Bank in a spare room inside his residence, hiring Qiu Songlin as the manager. Mr. Zhuang only managed the overall planning, and traveled by car. He became a target for criminals. Yesterday was the end of the month for settling accounts, and the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, so the bank sent staff to collect payments from various places, receiving over one thousand yuan in cash. Suddenly, four robbers arrived, two dressed in short jackets and two in long gowns. One robber acted as a lookout, while the others entered the house from the back door and broke into the bank's accounting room. They brandished guns, ordering everyone to be silent. They then stole the over one thousand yuan in cash and fled through the back door. Mr. Xu Lansheng, Mr. Zhuang's chauffeur, was about to enter the house when he saw the situation and knew something was wrong. He immediately turned back and followed closely, seeing three robbers fleeing towards the wasteland to the west. The other robber was trying to hire a rickshaw to escape. Upon seeing this, Mr. Xu bravely rushed forward and shouted, "Catch the robbers!" The robber panicked and told the rickshaw puller to turn into the alley next to the Jiuxing Cinema, intending to flee into the French Concession. Unexpectedly, French Constable No. 386 was patrolling the area and saw the pursuit. He ordered the rickshaw to stop. The robber, in desperation, pulled out his gun and opened fire on the constable. The French constable returned fire. At the same time, Public Concession Constable No. 3031 and Tanshui Road Constable No. 1441 heard the alarm and arrived to help. A fierce firefight ensued. Although the robber was wounded, he continued to flee until he reached Luzon Road, where he collapsed and died on the spot. The constable reported to the Xinzha Police Station, and the body was sent to the Renji Hospital. It was found that he had been shot seven times, all in vital areas. The body was then transferred to the coroner's office for examination. During the firefight, a passerby named Zhang Miaotou was grazed in the left foot by a stray bullet. He went to the Renji Hospital for treatment and was discharged. The other robbers are currently being pursued by the Public Concession and French Concession police.</p>
<h3>When Well-Fed, Lin Yaoxuan Falls for a "Fairy Jump"</h3>
<p>The Hospital Director's Wife is Alluring</p>
<p>A Foreign Goods Broker Introduces the Couple</p>
<p>A Large Man Breaks in, Displaying a Fierce Demeanor</p>
<p>Coerced into Signing an IOU in the French Concession</p>
<p>-Three People Arrested After Reporting to the Police-</p>
<p>Lin Yaoxuan, a Sichuan native, 28 years old, travels between Sichuan and Shanghai, trading in silver ear and foreign goods. He resides in Shanghai at No. 37, Yiji Sichuan Gang Zihao, Huicheng Lane, 46 Route Tenant de Vaux, in the French Concession. He has accumulated some savings. Recently, being alone in Shanghai, he could not avoid the boredom of sleeping alone. He was looking for a companion to relieve his loneliness. A few days ago, a familiar foreign goods broker, Hu Ruiting, a Zhenjiang native (30 years old, residing at No. 11 Yong'an Lane, Rue Père Robert), introduced a young woman, Shen Wu, to Lin, claiming she was the wife of Shen Shoukang, the director of Jiankang Hospital at 25 Avenue Joffre. (Note: Shen Shoukang is a broker for the Kangye Tobacco Company. He accumulated wealth and founded a hospital, but he is not a doctor and hires doctors to provide treatment.) Lin found her beautiful and, after talking with her, found her gentle and quite charming. Seeing that his plan was succeeding, Hu asked Lin to go to a hotel with her. Lin agreed. At 2:00 PM, Hu accompanied Lin and Shen Wu to Room 523 on the fifth floor of the Central Hotel on Wuma Road. Hu then pretended to go to the restroom and slipped away. Seeing that Hu had left, Lin closed the door, and he and Shen Wu became more intimate, expressing their love for each other. Suddenly, three large men pushed open the door. One of them claimed to be Shen Wu's husband, slapped Lin and Shen Wu, and accused Lin of seducing his wife. While they were arguing, two more men arrived, beating Lin severely and threatening to take him to the police station. Lin had no choice but to beg them for mercy. The five men then began to negotiate, demanding that Lin pay 1,000 yuan in compensation. Since Lin had no cash, they first seized the gold watch he was wearing and 15 yuan in cash. After arguing until after 3:00 PM, the five men took Lin to the Law Office of Zhang Wei at No. 5, across from the Second District Court on Route Chevalier Garnier in the French Concession. (Zhang was out, so they drafted a contract, forcing Lin to write two IOUs for 500 yuan each, totaling 1,000 yuan, with Chen Yi as the guarantor, due on October 1st (today), but writing the date of the IOU as July 14th. After signing the IOUs, they released Lin. At this point, Lin knew he had been scammed. The First Police Station refused to accept his report. He reported to the French Concession police, saying he had been kidnapped and escaped, requesting an investigation. Director Jin Jiulin and Deputy Inspector Jiang Changwen of the Special Service then questioned Lin about his kidnapping, realizing he had been scammed, falsely imprisoned, threatened, and extorted. That night, they led detectives Dai Rongji and Geng Quanchang to arrest Hu Ruiting. Hu confessed to the involvement of Chen Fuliang (the guarantor on the IOU), a Hangzhou native, and Li and Hong Erren, from Zhuji, who lived at No. 3 Yongshun Lane, Xujiahui Road, at the end of Caishi Road. The detectives rushed to the location at 9:00 AM yesterday, but Chen and Li had already left. They searched the residence, recovering the stolen gold watch and two IOUs. After waiting for about half an hour, Chen and Li returned and were arrested. They then went to arrest Shen Shoukang and Shen Wu, but the couple had already fled. Chen, Li, and Hu were taken back to the police station and sent to the Criminal Court of the Second District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozu tried the case. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuan stated that the police had not yet completed the investigation and that accomplices were still at large, requesting that the defendants be detained temporarily and the trial postponed for a week to apprehend the remaining suspects. Lin Yaoxuan then testified about the scam. Chen Fuliang testified that he was 32 years old, formerly served in the military, and was friends with Shen Shoukang. Yesterday, Shen called him to say his wife had been abducted and asked him to help find her at the Central Hotel. The plaintiff begged Shen to pay the damages, so he suggested they go to a law office to write a document. Hu Ruiting testified that Lu Xinghao introduced him to Shen Wu, and he introduced her to Lin Yaoxuan for adultery. They had already booked a room three times, and he knew nothing about the extortion. Li Hong testified that he was 30 years old, came to Shanghai on the 28th, worked at Jiankang Hospital, and stayed at Chen Fuliang's residence. Shen Shoukang invited him to go with him that day, but he was not present for the rest of the events. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered a retrial on October 6th, and the defendants were remanded to custody.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Restoring Shanghai South Public Buses</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai South Public Bus Company ceased operations due to poor management, public buses in the Shanghai South area have not been restored, causing great inconvenience to citizens. Recently, a merchant applied to raise funds to operate the buses, but the Public Utilities Bureau, mindful of past failures of commercial operations, fears repeating the same mistakes and affecting public transportation. Therefore, it plans to operate the buses itself and is actively planning and applying to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved, it can proceed with the operation. The rumor that the Public Utilities Bureau plans to transfer the operation to the Xingye Trust Company contradicts the organizational law and the organizational rules of the Shanghai Municipal Government and is not true.</p>
<h3>New Directory of Shanghai</h3>

In addition to classifying and recording business names, it includes many artistic illustrations and photographs, along with a brief overview of Shanghai tourist attractions, a street name comparison table, and a city map. It can be called an excellent guide for tourists visiting Shanghai. I received a copy yesterday and was greatly impressed by its quality. I am happy to introduce it and express my gratitude.</p>

<h3>Rapist Barber Defiles a Virgin</h3>
<p>Medical Examination Results</p>
<p>Chen Qingsheng, a native of Ningbo, his wife Chen Zhao, and his younger sister Jinxiang (14 years old) lived in a pavilion room upstairs at 121 Xinqiao Street, French Concession, above the Da Zhonghua Barber Shop. One night before last, around 11 PM, Qingsheng and his wife went out on errands, leaving Jinxiang alone asleep in bed. She was already fast asleep when Liu Xiaobin, a barber from Zhenjiang at the shop (nicknamed "Big Head," 26 years old), snuck upstairs. Seeing Jinxiang alone, he became emboldened by lust and thought he could take advantage of the helpless girl. He pulled down Jinxiang's trousers, climbed into bed, and as she was about to scream for help, Liu threatened her in every possible way. Jinxiang was alone and helpless, and was defiled. After the act, Liu further threatened Jinxiang, saying, "If you reveal this, your sister-in-law will beat you to death, and I'll just have to close my business." Jinxiang did not dare to tell her brother and sister-in-law about it, fearing a beating. She washed the bloodstains from her trousers. However, Jinxiang felt pain in her lower body and legs after the rape and secretly told her aunt about the incident. The aunt then told Qingsheng, who took Liu to the Great Bell Police Station. The police chief, as the key evidence (the bloody trousers) was gone, sent Jinxiang to a Western doctor for examination. The examination revealed that Jinxiang's hymen had been ruptured, suggesting she had been raped. With the truth now revealed, the police chief detained Liu Xiaobin, awaiting transfer to the court for investigation and punishment. Jinxiang was taken back by her brother to await questioning.</p>

<h3>Four Robbers Caught Red-Handed During Street Robbery</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiding, a Ningbo native residing at No. 5 Shude Lane, Pingji Li Road, French Concession, 24 years old, worked as an accountant at the Maxim dance hall on Aiduya Road. Yesterday morning at 3:30 AM, he was on his way home from work when four robbers suddenly blocked his path at the intersection of Boer Road and Pingji Li Road (a common practice known as "skinning a pig"). They robbed him of 108 silver dollars. While they were searching him, Chief Detective Lu Zhulin, Deputy Detective Zhang Daorong, Wang Rusong, Bao Detective Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshu, Wu Jiahui, and others from the French police happened to be patrolling.

<h3>Autopsy of a Girl Burned to Death</h3>
<p>The firewood shop opened by Bian Jingen, a native of Jiangyin, at No. 42 Sanyi Lane, Yangshupu Road, suddenly caught fire in the back building around 4 PM the day before yesterday. The fire quickly spread to the front building. At that time, only Bian's five-year-old daughter, named Fengying, was sleeping in the room, so there was no time to rescue her. She was severely burned. Fortunately, the fire brigade was notified early and arrived quickly to put out the fire, so it was extinguished in just over ten minutes. The child was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but she died soon after. The Yangshupu police ordered Detective Ji Xiucheng to investigate, and the body was taken to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo of the First Special District Court visited the center to examine the body. According to Bian Jingen, 46 years old, he was not at home that day. The back building was occupied by his daughter-in-law, who was working in the factory and had not yet returned home. Therefore, he did not know the cause of the fire. His daughter was sleeping downstairs, and by the time her mother tried to rescue her, it was too late, and she was burned to death. Mr. Guo, after hearing the testimony, determined that the deceased, Bian Fengying, had indeed been burned to death before death, and the body was released to her father, Bian Jingen, to be coffined and buried with a written guarantee.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News from the National Games</h3>
<p>Urgent Request for Rosters (Nanjing, 30th) The National Games Organizing Committee urgently telegraphed the four units of Ping, Hong Kong, Yunnan, and Fujian to submit their athlete rosters by the 30th, requesting them to register via telegram.</p>
<p>Group Visits The committee sent a letter to various organizations and schools, stating that due to the large number of spectators expected during the Double Tenth Festival, overcrowding would be unavoidable. Groups intending to visit were required to notify the reception section of the organizing committee with their visiting time and number of people before October 8th, in order to reserve seats.</p>
<p>Group Exercises The elementary schools of Jing City and Pukou rehearsed Tai Chi exercises at Xingzhongmen Elementary School on the afternoon of the 30th. 191 students from the Four Academies participated, still under the direction of Chu Minyi. Xingzhongmen Elementary School was the most organized. Overall, based on the six days of district rehearsals, the performances from the Central and Eastern Districts were considered superior.</p>
<p>Teacher Tea Party The committee scheduled a tea party for physical education teachers from various elementary schools in Jing City at the Lizhi Society on the afternoon of October 2nd at 2 p.m. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Director and the Shaanxi Province Director Fu were sent to participate in the opening ceremony. Prizes Received Song Zheyuan of Harbin sent a letter designating Ge Dingyuan, director of the 29th Army's Beijing office, to represent him at the National Games opening ceremony, and donated one hundred yuan for prizes. Chen Bulei, director of the Zhejiang Education Department, sent a four-panel screen painting of West Lake scenery as a prize for the National Games.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Not Participating The National Games Organizing Committee received a telegram from Shaanxi Province stating that due to the impact of natural disasters in the province, they would not be sending athletes to participate at this time. They have telegraphed Director Fu, stationed in Beijing, to attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>Position of Secretary-General The position of section chief of the National Games Organizing Committee was originally held by Wu Bangwei. However, Wu was unable to attend due to his involvement in the Jiangsu Provincial Games. After repeatedly declining the position to the committee, the organizing committee decided to ask Secretary-General Zhang Xinfu to concurrently serve as section chief. However, Zhang, citing a busy schedule, found it difficult to manage both roles. As a result, Zhang, in a personal capacity, invited Wu Bangwei to Beijing to handle the allocation. Wu only stayed in Beijing for two days and then hastily departed for Zhenjiang on the 28th to take on the role of guiding the Jiangsu athletes. Therefore, the various allocations were not fully completed, and the allocation is practically inseparable from the records. The scoring sheets need to be prepared according to the allocation procedure. Therefore, Zhang Zhongfan, the section chief of the records section, had to take on the task of allocation in order to fulfill his duty of recording, which was an unavoidable situation. In recent days, Mr. Zhang has been working diligently through the night. Everyone in the committee knows this. Last night, Zhang Xinfu went to Hangzhou. Regarding Zhang's duties as Secretary-General during his absence from Beijing, someone will naturally be responsible for presiding over them, and not Zhang Zhongfan acting temporarily. Lest there be any misunderstanding, the truth is clarified as above.</p>
<h3>Organizing Committee Appoints Additional Presidents</h3>
<p>In addition to the appointed President of the National Games, Wang Shijie, Honorary President Lin Sen, and Honorary Vice Presidents Wang Zhaoming and Chiang Kai-shek, the Organizing Committee appointed a large number of additional Vice Presidents and Honorary Vice Presidents on the 30th as follows:</p>
<p>Vice Presidents: Chu Minyi, Shi Ying, Luo Jialun, Zhang Daofan, Guo Chuntao, Zeng Zhongming, Gan Naiguang, Xu Mo, Zou Lin, Zheng Tianxi, Li Shijia, Duan Xipeng, Qian Changzhao.</p>
<p>Honorary Vice Presidents: Dai Chuanxian, Song Ziwen, Niu Yongjian, Sun Ke, Shao Yuanchong, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Ju Zheng, Qin Zhen.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Athletes Determined for National Games</h3>
<p>Departing on the 4th, the Best Chances in Men's Swimming and Baseball</p>
<p>Highest Hopes for Women's Swimming</p>
<p>The Hong Kong District Preparatory Committee for the National Games held its fifth meeting on the 25th. More than ten representatives from various associations attended. Chairman Lin Yiqiu first asked each department to report on the selection of representatives and fundraising progress.</p>
<p>Swimming The swimming department reported on the water competition, having selected Mai Weiming. Because Mai Weiming's results in the 1500m race were better than Liang Weilin's, and to save on expenses, Liang Weilin was canceled, and Mai Weiming will participate in the 1500m race instead.</p>
<p>Tennis The tennis department reported that Xu Huipei will play for Guangzhou. However, because Xu Jun, a famous player from Java, is willing to assist Hong Kong, there are no issues with strength.</p>
<p>Track and Field The track and field department reported that men's track and field results will be difficult to catch up to the national level. If there are sufficient funds, at most five people can be sent. As for women, there is no hope, and they will not be sent. It is hoped that Hong Kong people will step up their practice in this area in the future.</p>
<p>Volleyball The volleyball department reported that players have already been sent from various associations and schools. Team practice began tonight (ie. the 25th). Women's volleyball is also proceeding similarly.</p>
<p>Basketball The basketball department director was not present, but the list has been tentatively finalized. Women's basketball is also being prepared considerably.</p>
<p>Soccer The soccer department reported that the match against the Army team on Sunday raised over 460 yuan. After clearing expenses, a total of over 300 yuan was donated. Regarding the shortage of players, it is planned to telegram Singapore players to return to Hong Kong for assistance.</p>
<p>Baseball The baseball department director was not present. Lin Yiqiu reported on behalf, saying that a total of over 60 yuan has been raised, which is more than 40 yuan short of the original amount.</p>
<p>Film The film department reported that more than 5 yuan was received. After deducting the venue rental and the rental of 700 yuan, a total of over 300 yuan was raised.</p>
<p>Donations Lin Yiqiu said that donations are currently underway and will be announced when Mr. Mo returns to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Then began discussion of the ship space issue. The chairman said that the ship is scheduled to set sail on October 4th. There are third-class and second-class spaces, both at the same price. The consensus was to give the higher class seats to the female athletes first. The chairman also said that regarding asking the various labor unions to subsidize their representatives, a letter should be sent to notify them first. Everyone agreed to send a letter to notify them. Then the various departments presented tentative lists of representatives as follows:</p>

<h3>Wang Wenzheng Wins the Municipal Men's Singles Tennis Championship</h3>
<p>3-1 Victory over Yu Tianguang</p>
<p>Women's Singles Belongs to Mao Yuwen</p>
<p>2-0 Victory over Wang Dale</p>
<p>The results of yesterday's finals for the municipal men's and women's singles tennis championships are as follows: Wang Wenzheng won the men's championship, defeating Yu Tianguang 3-1; Mao Yuwen won the women's championship, winning 2-0 against Wang Dale. Today's doubles matches have been postponed due to the conflict with the Lawn Tennis Club's Open Doubles Final. The finals date will be around Wednesday afternoon, still at the China Sports Association tennis courts on Hart Road. The progress of yesterday's men's and women's finals is described below:</p>
<h3>Wang Wenzheng Defeats Yu Tianguang 3-1</h3>
<p>Yu Tianguang's victory over Wang Wenzheng was overwhelming in the first set, winning 6-2. Who knew that he would collapse afterwards and be unable to recover? The championship was then decided. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Two to Six</p>
<p>Six to Zero</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Six to Three Yu Tianguang</p>
<p>Six to Four</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang's Rise and Fall The great change in the overall result could not be predicted from the momentum of the first set. Yu Tianguang served first, hitting both left and right with great advantage. His hitting technique was excellent and his errors were few. Wang Wenzheng had no way to handle this. Unexpectedly, Yu Tianguang's power was but a flash in the pan. The first serve was won by Wang Wenzheng. Yu also broke back. Yu then served again. His shot was powerful. As the ball left his hand, he rushed forward to the net for a volley. Wang Wenzheng could only watch helplessly, making it 2-1. Wang served again, strongly and deeply into both corners, making it 2-2. Yu did not falter slightly, fighting more and more bravely. Wang Wenzheng had not yet gotten his grip. The ball was always two or three inches outside the line. Thus, one game after another, Wang Wenzheng lost four games in a row. Yu Tianguang won the first set 6-2. However, his early momentum faded, and he lost three sets in a row, which was also unexpected.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng's Momentum The Yu Tianguang in the first set completely changed in the second set, becoming weak and listless. His balls went out of bounds repeatedly, or into the net. The skillful net volleys of the first set were also gone. Wang Wenzheng again and again won six games in a row, returning a blank set, which was unexpected. Each switched to a new ball, hoping Yu Tianguang would perk up, but that hope was lost. Yu served powerfully and with preparation, hitting well and winning the first game. Because Wang was out of bounds, he won another game. His momentum was sufficient. The situation changed again. He made many mistakes, and his power also greatly decreased. Wang Wenzheng took advantage of this and attacked fiercely, winning five games in a row, and winning the third set 6-3, taking the lead with two sets to one. The last set was the end of the line. Although Yu was still ahead 2-1, Wang Wenzheng took the next three games, making it a 4-2 advantage. Yu won back two games to even the score 4-4, but it was to no avail. Wang Wenzheng finished the game with 6-4. Wang Wenzheng's shots were stable, and his mistakes were few, so he deserved to win.</p>
<h3>Mao Yuwen Defeats Wang Dale 2-0</h3>
<p>In the women's final, Mao Yuwen won both sets against Wang Dale to win the match. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Six to Two</p>
<p>Mao Yuwen Wang Dale</p>
<p>Six to One</p>
<p>Wang was no match for Mao. Mao was stable and skilled, with good forehand and backhand shots, deep and far. In the first set, Mao won three games in a row. Wang won one game, then it became 4-2. Mao finished the first set with 6-2. The second set was even worse. Wang only won one game, the third game. The score finished 6-1.</p>
<p>No Matches Today There are no matches today due to the impact of the Open Doubles. The matches will have to rest for one day. Yu Zhizhong of the Nanjing Amateur Tennis Club has come to Shanghai and has agreed to let the Shanghai team practice at the Amateur Tennis Club's courts during the National Games, which is very kind. The results of the first week of the men's doubles are appended below:</p>
<p>(1) Mao Hongfa and Liang Guanying defeated Hu Qichang and Hu Qichao 9-7, 0-6, 6-2.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau to Make Uniforms for the Municipal National Games Delegation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau believes that the uniforms for the delegation participating in the National Games should be uniform to enhance the appearance, and has entrusted the Huadong Sports Equipment Company on Jing'an Temple Road to make various types of uniforms. Currently, the uniforms for the members of each team have been roughly made. However, many of the general leaders and coaches for both male and female track and field athletes have not yet been measured. As the departure date for Beijing is approaching, all members who have not yet measured their sizes must go to the company on Jing'an Temple Road to be measured this afternoon (Sunday) at 2 PM. However, athletes must bring their Municipal Games registration receipt.</p>

<h3>First Battle of the Chi Ling Chi Cup: Donghua Defeats Western Police</h3>
<p>1-1 Draw in the Morning</p>
<p>Donghua Wins 2-1 in the End</p>
<p>The first battle of this year's Chi Ling Chi Cup between Donghua and Western Police was held yesterday at the baseball field. The weather was clear and the spectators were extremely enthusiastic. The stands were packed with people, creating an extremely lively atmosphere. To put it lightly, there were at least 10,000 spectators. As a result of 90 minutes of fighting, Donghua won 2-1.</p>
<p>Kuir Gives the Award for Past Achievements The Chi Ling Chi Cup began last year. Donghua won both games and won the cup. The award ceremony was delayed. Yesterday, the second year of the competition began. Before the battle, Mr. Kuir, the football director of the Western Police, held the dazzling silver cup in front of the players of both teams, made a sincere speech, and personally presented the silver cup to Lu Zhong'en, the captain of Donghua. Lu replied with a thank you. The first year's history ended, and the whistle for the second year's battle was heard in the field again.</p>
<p>Donghua's Power Remains the Same Donghua's performance was as good as last year. The small movements of the forwards' feet were clever and worth watching. The wings contributed a lot. The shooting in the middle was a pity. The three veterans on the middle defense line were good at assisting, but their strength was not sufficient. Perhaps they were not in the best condition. Li Ning was quite good, and Guan Xun'an made significant progress. This is something that Donghua can be pleased about. Zhou Xianyan was not yet skilled in training, so Lu Zhongs came in instead. Lu was also qualified. His crouching save of a bottom ball near the end of the game was highly praised.</p>
<p>Plattley's Good Skills The Western Police veteran Gash Parker Turner was not present, so it is easy to imagine what their strength was. The mainstay relied only on Plattley's goalkeeper. He had a great reputation before Zhou Xianyan, but had been out of action for several years due to injury. Now he is playing the old tune again, with the same old power. He is tall and strong, shrewd and experienced, and cannot be underestimated. The inside defense had no special features. Herre, in the middle defense line, served his duty. Weiss U was average. The forwards and the middle line were sometimes separated. Center forward Willy had no one to assist him and had no place to use his skills. Defly was okay. Jack was disappointing. The wings were frustrating.</p>
<p>Smiling Faces Heard Sighs The Western Police kicked off and immediately entered Donghua's feet. Li Yichen kicked the ball to the right, and Cao Qiuting rushed into the field. The spectators were energized and saw Western Police in danger. It was passed again and again, nearing the abdomen. As Li Yichen was about to set up his banner, he mistakenly touched his arm and was penalized. In the blink of an eye, it came again. Chen Jiaqiu swept the ball out behind the enemy. Wan Xianghua and Li Yichen chased forward. The inner court was empty. In the nick of time, Gibson chased to stop the advance. If Xiao Wan had shot earlier, the result might have been different. Two good opportunities were lost with the autumn wind. Unexpected danger suddenly arose on the left of the court. As Lu, the goalkeeper, was blocking left and right, he drew cheers from the audience. Because the kick-off was weak, and Feng Yunyou's assistance failed, he was tackled by the enemy. With a kick from Willy, Donghua was the first to concede. The spectators' smiling faces had not yet disappeared, and sighs came first.</p>
<p>Yichen's Header Makes it a Draw Donghua was angered by this blow. The five generals attacked separately. Feng Wu Tu coordinated in the middle. Li and Guan stationed troops in Guanzhong, providing assistance from afar. Western Police was greatly frightened by the growing momentum. Weiss and were helpless. Herre and Fralas looked at each other in dismay. Fortunately, the inner defense was still able to fight. Coming in and out repeatedly, Western Police was in dire straits and unable to find a way out. However, with the goalkeeper's health, it was not easy for Donghua to find a flaw. Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, forty minutes had passed. Feng Yunyou kicked a ball to the left. Wan Xianghua went deep, passing it to the middle. Li Yichen headed the ball head-on, flying into the net. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Hongguang Calmly Performs Great Feat Switching sides to fight again, they reorganized their forces. Donghua's momentum was so great that Western Police shrank back. Chen Jiaqiu, with Cao Qiuting's help, first shot, but was not accurate. Cao continued to advance, seeing that Chen Hongguang was unguarded, and took the opportunity to pass it to him. Chen, facing the empty goal, calmly and unhurriedly entered the palace. After Donghua took a 2-1 lead, the Western Police were like a plate of loose sand, open to attack. If Plattley's hands and feet had not been stable and his eyes had not been sharp, how could there have been such a slight difference in the result? Towards the end of the game, Western Police made a final struggle, taking advantage of the people's tiredness and invading the city in separate ways. For a time, the city was full of wind and rain, and every bush and tree seemed like an enemy. Willy attacked Lu's lower road in the crowd. Lu was able to catch it out by lying down. Both offense and defense were masterpieces. The battle time ended from there. Donghua won 2-1. The referee was Shen Huichun.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Society Holds Member Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussion on Individual-Centered and National-Centered Education Issues</p>
<p>Nomination of the Next Meeting Location and Convener</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Society held its fourth member meeting at the YMCA building on Eight Immortals Bridge at 7 p.m. the night before last, to discuss individual-centered and national-centered education issues, as well as various association affairs. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Members in Attendance: A total of several dozen people, including Chen XuanShan, Zhuang ZeXuan, Chen HeQin, Zheng XiGu, Dong RenJian, Liao MaoRu, Xie XunChu, Tai ShuangQiu, Zhang ZhongHuan, Zha LiangZhao, Mao YanWen, Ma ZongRong, Lu KeMei, Zhang ShuYi, Ni WenYa, and Sun KangZeng. Xie XunChu was the chairman, and Zhang ZhongHuan was the recorder. A. Report Items: The chairman reported on (1) changing the meeting convocation method, and (2) in addition to the regular meeting today, welcoming Mr. Zhuang ZeXuan. Zhuang ZeXuan reported on (1) the progress of the Guangdong Branch, (2) the educational situation in Guangdong, and (3) the planned activities of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center.</p>
<p>Discussion Issues: B. Discussion Issues: (1) Xie XunChu raised the issue of individual-centered education versus national-centered education, stating that there are two issues in education: one is the purpose, and the other is the method. Individual-centered education is the method of education, and national-centered education is the purpose of education. Because the nation and the individual cannot be separated, education is to nationalize the individual, so individual-centered education and national-centered education do not conflict. (2) Zheng XiGu stated that past education has been more focused on the development of the individual and less on the consciousness of the nation. Future education should focus on cultivating the spirit of the nation. (3) Liao MaoRu stated that although past education emphasized loyalty to the monarch and love for the country, it often focused on honoring ancestors and becoming famous, thus neglecting the nation and focusing on the individual. Future education should transform the concept of the nation, and to achieve this goal, more attention should be paid to broad education. (4) Zhang YouSan stated that in reality, the government treats individual-centered education and national-centered education as opposing terms. Mr. Hu Hanmin emphasized public character and not individuality. The actions of our people are scattered, but their thoughts are not free at all. However, an excellent nation must be organized by excellent individuals. The so-called excellent individual is by no means blindly following but truly free, so individual-centered education is by no means selfishness. (5) Chen KeMei stated that both individual-centered education and national-centered education are the purpose of education and are conflicting, but the conflict between the two is relative rather than absolute, meaning that it should be decided whether to focus on the national aspect or the individual aspect according to the needs of the times. (6) Tai ShuangQiu stated that there are three starting points for education: one is the individual, two is the nation, and three is society, so it is not only individual-centered education and national-centered education. (7) Zhuang ZeXuan stated that Chinese education is centered on the nation and not on the individual, the nation, or society.</p>
<p>Meeting Resolutions: (1) The case of the location, time, and convener for the next meeting was resolved. It was decided that the next meeting would be convened by Ou HuaiAn, Tai ShuangQiu, Ni WenYa, and Ma ZongRong, the location would be in the Great China New Village, the issues for discussion would be determined by the convener, and the date would be set in mid-October. (2) The case of recommending representatives to contact Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng was resolved to be discussed at the next meeting. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Escape</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Individuals, regardless of their status, when they have been deeply involved in the world, even if they are wielding power and authority, seemingly invincible. Little do they realize that this state of affairs cannot be enjoyed for long. If you! Look at it with a true perspective, alas! It is truly like white clouds and grey dogs, changing in an instant, or like sparks from flint and flashes of lightning, impossible to grasp even a bit. To speak of more recent examples, since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China, Sichuan's Wang RenWen and Jiangsu's Cheng XueLou were both influential figures of their time, holding military power in their hands, and certainly not insignificant lower officials. Yet, in the end, they would suddenly realize the truth, go to practice asceticism, become monks. Furthermore, Lu WeiXiang was not without a minor reputation in the diplomatic world. He did not return from abroad for a long time, and later in Europe, he entered a monastery to end his life. Thus, it can be seen that worldly fame and wealth can ultimately be shed, unlike life, which cannot be abandoned. Understanding this point thoroughly can make one realize that those who are fighting for power and profit in the dark are truly pitiable!</p>
<p>Now, it is heard that Sun ChuanFang, through the introduction of the Panchen Lama, has received ordination before the lamas and has also taken Xi Yue, a monk, as his teacher in Peiping. From then on, he chants sutras, worships Buddha, and becomes a disciple of the empty gate. Isn't this a strange thing? Sun ChuanFang once served as the commander-in-chief of five provinces, and none of his subordinates, such as Meng ZhaoYue, Zhou FengQi, and Lu XiangTing, were not battle-hardened generals who secretly uttered battle cries. Alas! When they went against the trend and the soldiers refused to obey orders, they were utterly defeated. Imagine! How long ago was it that this situation was like floating dust in the air, passing in an instant? To seek his past traces is to find nothing but shadows. The ancients called it "unbearable to look back." Sun ChuanFang, at the end of his heroic road, probably felt this kind of repentance, so he saw through the vanity of the world, went forth to seek a pure and happy land to spend his remaining years. From the current era of vexing punishments, war, and the suffering of the people, an era of chaos and no governance, Sun ChuanFang still has a little clarity in his mind. "Lay down the butcher's knife" and become a Buddha on the spot is a sermon for this generation of people!</p>
<p>However, Sun ChuanFang's ordination to study Buddhism can be regarded as redeeming the sins of his past life. It is his own affair, not his heart for the people. What does this mean? Because the heart of a Bodhisattva is to save the world, not to be weary of it. If, after having exhausted all authority, everyone thinks that the seat of the Buddha can be used as a place to hide, then lofty retirement is not allowed, let alone entering the empty gate? How can he face all sentient beings? Therefore, although Sun ChuanFang has received ordination, his qualifications for "studying Buddhism" are still not up to par. He can only be considered "escaping Chan." Moreover, whether he can cleanse his six senses, sacrifice this turbid body, and practice asceticism and poverty, I am afraid that the restless heart will be difficult to rely on. According to his own words, this time he was ordained because he had "no master in his heart and no one to rely on." In this way, it is really out of necessity, not out of faith. Haha! If the Buddha knew this, wouldn't it be a great sin not to give him a stern reprimand?</p>
<h3>Ma Jong and the Seizing of Manchuria</h3>
<p>— YanQiao</p>
<p>Ma Jong evolved from Ma Diao, Hu Shih said this long ago. However, Ma Diao only has forty cards, from one cash to nine cash, one thousand cash to nine thousand cash, one myraid cash to nine myraid cash, besides that there is a zero card. Ma Jong has one hundred and thirty-six cards, the more there is, the more variation, so Ma Jong is popular around the world and Ma Diao is being eliminated.</p>
<p>Wu MeiCun had the "Ma Diao destroys the country" theory, but Yang GuangXian borrowed it as material to praise the Imperial Dynasty. Of course, one side said it was the tool to destroy the country, the other side said it was the pioneer to raise the country up. On September 18th, China was in mourning, Japan was celebrating. Heaven also joined in, giving China the second storm and giving Japan a little sunshine.</p>
<p>At the end of Ming Dynasty, a remaining people wrote a note in his notebook, saying "No one knows when the Leaf Game came about? When JingXi came into power, the ten people with chaotic behavior forgot about sleep and food, going from night to day, calling it Ma Diao." This situation and the Ma Jong craze in various places now are not far apart. If you went to the big hotels in Shanghai to take a look, maybe "today's people are better than ancient people."</p>
<p>Yang GuangXian's Ma Diao introduction says: "The color of the leaves is green, green means Qing. The win is marked with red, symbolizing today's crown. The one with the most marks is called Smooth Flag, symbolizing the year. Winning means to seize Manchu, symbolizing the Manchus winning." It is convincingly attached, I cannot not admire Mr. Yang's intelligence, and it praises the system well. Not just praise, but also a prediction, aren't they really seizing Manchu now! The Japanese seized Manchuria from the Chinese and still put on an act, placing a puppet as a shield, the Chinese certainly feel pain, and wouldn't the puppet feel sad too? I wonder if the Chinese will have the day to seize it back?</p>
<p>Some people say that Ma Jong was created by the remaining people of Ming, the so-called "Pure One Color" "Take Apart the Tartars" terms, all are curses towards the Qing Dynasty. I am afraid this saying came from the Ma Diao preface. With praise, there will always be curses. But I also want to say that it is a prediction, you can't make Pure One Color, you make Mess One Color, that "Fake Manchu Country," isn't that making China, Japan, and Manchu into one pot? Even until now, you can't say who the real rightful owner is.</p>
<h3>The Cricket Jumps to the City God Temple</h3>
<p>— ShiJiu</p>
<p>"The cricket cries 'Qu, qu', little treasure's heart wants it; pry open the brick, peel the 'du', it jumps, jumps to the City God Temple, the incense burner and candle holder all fall down!"</p>
<p>This children's song is not only harmonious in its entirety, but also sings with three sighs at the end, making it even more lingering for three days without end. According to this song, it is quite in line with the meaning of comparison and metaphor. Upon investigation, there is great truth in it. If we imitate the example of Mao Gong's preface to poetry to preface it, we can obtain the following sentences:</p>
<p>"It satirizes greed. People's hearts are greedy and mean, and they chase after profit and desire, and they can never be at peace."</p>
<p>Let's take "lottery tickets" as an example. This big "cricket" is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars; how can "little treasure," who wants to get rich, not want to get it by chance! "Prying open the brick" means that they know it is not necessarily obtainable, but they want to give it a try. "City God" is a metaphor for people who are blessed by the God of Wealth. However, "ill-gotten gains do not enrich the poor!" This "City God," after getting the first prize, attracts ruffians and kidnappers, and it is difficult to live in peace in the "temple." "The incense burner and candle holder all fall down" is an extreme expression of his unease.</p>
<p>Let's take the "empress" as an example. This big "cricket" can make people "turn upside down"; how can "little treasure," who suffers from lust, not want to pursue it! "Prying open the brick" means trying their best to follow closely and not let go of a single step. "City God" is a metaphor for a rival in love. However, a beautiful woman is ultimately a disaster! This "City God," although triumphant in the arena of love, makes the "temple" restless, with the broom upside down. "The incense burner and candle holder all fall down" is also an extreme expression of his unease.</p>
<p>By extension, wanting to be an official, wanting to collect debts, can all be viewed in this way! Therefore, if the "cricket" never stops, then "little treasure's" heart will never die; and the "City God," and the "temple" of the "City God," will never be at peace, alas!</p>
<h3>Time Comes and Luck Comes, Yu YouQing</h3>
<p>I often hear a saying, "When time comes and luck comes, you can eat meat out of tofu." The meaning of this saying is coming true for comrades who smoke cigarettes now. I only remember that cigarette packs could be exchanged for cigarettes, or for towels, cologne, etc. I never thought that cigarette packs now have become term deposit checks in the bank.</p>
<p>For example, taking Red Lion brand cigarettes as an example, ten packs are worth 10,000 yuan, almost one pack has the hope of 1,000 yuan. If you throw away a Red Lion brand cigarette pack, it is equivalent to throwing away a 1,000 yuan check. For a cigarette that costs five cents, after you smoke the cigarette, the pack is still worth 1,000 yuan. Then the value of the pack is greater than the cigarette. Spending five cents has the hope of 1,000 yuan. Please have the students calculate this price, you won't be able to get the same rate, this is a shocking matter.</p>
<p>After smoking other cigarettes, there are golden betel nut trees, golden tripods, and gift certificates from the three major companies, placed in front of our eyes, how envious. If your forehead shines, then when time comes and luck comes, a thunderclap out of nowhere, you can become a small rich man, this is the special right of comrades who smoke cigarettes. If you want to get rich, of course you have to step up your work, which is to increase the amount of cigarettes you smoke. If you usually smoke one pack, then you have to smoke at least three or four packs. Ten years later, parents will have to teach their children the skill of smoking. No matter where you are, it will be a world of cigarettes with smoke everywhere, I never thought that after opium was popular for a while, what followed was cigarettes? In the future, people in society who do not smoke cigarettes will either be fools or idiots, don't they want to get rich! I changed the following sentence of "When time comes and luck comes, you can eat meat out of tofu." It becomes "When time comes and luck comes, you can eat money out of cigarettes." Haha!</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Bitter Feelings in the Breast, Still Offer Blessings; Busy Military Affairs, Secretly Shift Troops</p>
<p>Whenever young people see a bride, they cannot help but feel a sense of joy. However, when JiZhi saw the bride at this moment, it was as if a sharp pair of scissors pierced straight through his chest. As he walked this way, the old Mrs. Yang JiangShi had already seen him. Fearing that something embarrassing would happen, she rushed in front of JiZhi in a few steps and said with a smile: "Mr. Gan, how did you know? Today is the day of our daughter's engagement. We are just about to go take a photo." Although JiZhi was stunned, it only lasted for two minutes. At this time, he had already woken up. If he showed a foolish appearance in front of so many people, wouldn't that be a joke? So he forced a smile and said: "This is quite a coincidence, I actually caught up with the wedding banquet. Zhao ZiQiang had already seen him too, and rushed forward two steps to shake hands with him. JiZhi shook his hand and said: "Company Commander Zhao, I haven't thanked you yet. Thanks to your introduction, I found such a position where there is work to do and no anger to suffer. Today I came just in time, there is nothing to congratulate, I wish you a happy old age." As he said this, his eyes were already shooting towards GuiZhi's body in the distance. Although GuiZhi was standing inside the door, her eyes were also shooting like lightning onto JiZhi's body. At this time, with their eyes meeting, GuiZhi had married another person. For this frustrated lover, she could not help but feel a little ashamed, so although she was very calm, a wave of heat in her heart still rushed to her face, so she couldn't help but lower her head. Zhao ZiQiang knew a little about the past relationship between JiZhi and GuiZhi in theory. Seeing his forced smile at this time, he was also very clear in his heart, so he patted JiZhi's shoulder with his other hand and said: "When I finish this, I will find a place, let's have a drink."

<p>Children's Fun World</p>
<h3>Two Children's Works</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The Cricket's Struggle The giant wheel of the times is rolling on. From that gentle spring, to the hot summer, it unconsciously turned to the cool autumn, turning all year round, endlessly circulating.</p>
<p>Autumn is coming. The autumn of the insect world is coming. In this autumn, we always hear the cries of many insects at night, as if they are holding a big concert. Among the insects, there is a kind of cricket, they have no sense of community, but have an inferior nature of mutual killing.</p>
<p>Once, I saw a cricket living in a pile of grass. Another cricket walked here, looking for food. When that cricket came to rob his house, they fought. As a result of the fight, both crickets died. They are of the same kind, why fight like this and sacrifice two lives, it is really not worth it!</p>
<p>We humans catch them and put them in cricket jars to play with. We put two crickets in a jar and lure them to fight. They don't know the temptation of humans, and they are fooled by us, fighting. In the end, it is either injury or death. The winner still cries 'Qu, qu' to ridicule his kind. This kind of insect is extremely low in its level. But alas, China is also like this, fighting with its own people. Year after year, so our China is bullied and looked down upon by foreign countries. Now we should unite and do our best to resist foreigners, and not kill each other again.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Memory</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ling</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, the hot summer has passed, and the cool autumn has come again. Now, I occasionally recall an interesting thing I did one evening in the summer, and I write it down below:</p>
<p>As the fiery sun gradually fell from the west, the earth suddenly became somewhat dark, but after a while the moon came out sparklingly. And there were countless stars next to it, also coming out with the moon, as if they were protecting the moon. The moon and the stars drove away the darkness and emitted a bright light. And the blue color of the sky, lining the silvery-white stars, made this evening even more bright and lovely, making people feel very bright in their eyes when they saw it, and even making people feel very cool in their hearts. So at this time, many men, women and children were smiling, came out to enjoy the cool air, talking and laughing, very happy.</p>
<p>My family was also like this. After eating dinner, we all went to the garden to enjoy the cool air. My grandmother and parents were also enjoying the cool air under the corridor. My siblings and I sat down in the pavilion and started telling stories and jokes, very happy. And the wind was very strong here, because next to the pavilion were many tall and drooping willow trees, so it was very cool. We had just finished telling a story, took a break, and looked out at the evening scenery. As we were looking out, there were many things flying there that were bright and bright, and they turned out to be countless fireflies. I hurriedly called my brother to look. After my brother looked, he said: "Let's get fans and bottles, catch them, put them in the bottle, it's very fun." I originally liked fireflies too. After hearing my brother's words, I agreed very much, so I hurried to get the fans and bottles. We clapped very hard. After a while, the bottle was full. My siblings and I all jumped up happily. We wanted to clap again, but it was already ten o'clock, so we put away all kinds of things and walked into the room, turned off the lights, and took out the bottle. It was really beautiful! It turned out that the fireflies in the bottle seemed to have turned into many small lanterns. Because I clapped so many fireflies that night, I also had the same dream after sleeping.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>American Bank Exchange Rate Rises, Gold Price Drops Six Yuan Two</p>
<p>October 4th, Mid-Autumn Festival, Gold Exchange Closed</p>

The forward silver price at the Metal Exchange rose by 5.5 and 3 points, respectively. London raw gold rose by 8 pence, and stock prices rose and fell slightly.

However, due to the Central Bank's dumping, the internal market for American exchange became strong, and rumors spread within the market that the fineness of American gold would be reduced by 60 percent. People's hearts were even more tired, and sellers were more active, so the gold price in the second half of the day was difficult to revive. Fortunately, Dalian gangs came in to hedge forward bids, which could still be struggled, and the half-day ups and downs were quite narrow, and no huge storms were seen. The price of raw gold was 1,100 yuan. October 4th is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and banks are closed as usual, and the Gold Exchange is also closed for one day, which has already been announced.

Bing Xing and Heng Xing sold, and finally retreated to 3 yuan. The highest price in the half-day was 776 yuan, 6 jiao, and the lowest price was 772 yuan, with only 4 yuan, 6 jiao in ups and downs. As a result, it fell 6 yuan, 2 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price was 30 yuan, 1 jiao, 2.5 points due to the HSBC bank's American exchange listing rising 375 points, and the combined gold price was 796 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen.

<h3>A Review of Foreign Dollar Lending Rates</h3>
<p>In September, various industries saw increased demand, and the flow of foreign currency was slightly smoother, so the market price of foreign dollar lending rates seemed to rise compared to the previous month. There were daily rates of 5-6%, and there were no instances of unsecured lending on the market. As a result, the total monthly count was quite high, reaching 1.9 yuan. Based on a 30-day count, the average daily rate was 0.06334, a slight difference from the fixed deposit interest rate of 2 yuan. It is said that the proposed interest rate for this item is generally between 2.95% and a discount.</p>
<h3>Banks' Joint Reserve Committee Revises Clearing House Regulations</h3>
<p>The Clearing House established by the Joint Reserve Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association has been actively planning since its opening on January 10th of this year, and has made considerable progress. Initially, the exchange of negotiable instruments was limited to 32 exchange banks. Later, in March, all local branches of various banks joined the exchange, with each bank acting as its own agent, totaling 57 branches. Recently, three banks, including China United Savings Bank, Kwangtung Industrial &amp; Enterprise Bank, have applied to join as exchange banks. It is heard that the application has been approved by the association and will take effect on October 2nd. Therefore, the number of banks participating in the exchange has increased from 32 to 35 (list of exchange banks attached), with a total of over 90 banks including the branches of various banks. Reviewing the monthly exchange statistics published by the association, the daily average total exchange amount is approximately 3,000 negotiable instruments, with a value of 7-8 million. This is only a centralized settlement of a portion of the financial industry, and the results are already as described above. If more parties join the exchange, there will be even more satisfactory results. Recently, in order to enhance its effectiveness and meet the needs of silver and money businesses outside the exchange banks, the exchange has proposed expanding the scope of agency exchange. At the 9th Committee Bank Representative Conference held by the association a few days ago, this matter was discussed. It was unanimously agreed that the scope of exchange should be expanded as soon as possible, and that exchange banks should provide other banks, trust companies, and money shops with the same convenience as their branches. It was decided that the agency exchange section of the association's Negotiable Instrument Exchange Regulations should be amended to reduce the responsibilities of the agent banks while expanding the scope of agency exchange. This matter concerns the entire financial industry in Shanghai. After inquiry, the reporter has obtained the content of this amended agency exchange method, and the key points are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Scope of Agency: (A) An exchange bank may be entrusted by various banks, trust companies, or member money shops of the Shanghai Money Trade Association to act as an agent for the exchange of negotiable instruments at the Joint Reserve Committee. (B) The banks or trust companies or money shops that entrust agency exchange (hereinafter referred to as "entrusting banks") are limited to those whose head offices have been operating for more than two years.</p>
<p>(2) Agency Contract: The entrusting bank has the obligation to comply with the Negotiable Instrument Exchange Regulations. Before the start of the agency, a contract shall be signed with the agent bank. (3) Negotiable Instruments for Agency Exchange: (A) All negotiable instruments that can be exchanged received by the entrusting bank shall be sent to the agent bank for exchange. (B) The negotiable instruments mentioned above shall be affixed with the exchange stamp of both the entrusting bank and the agent bank in addition to the original endorsement stamp of the entrusting bank.</p>
<p>(4) Transfer of Agency Exchange Difference: The entrusting bank shall open a current account with the agent bank for the purpose of receiving and paying the agency exchange difference.</p>
<p>These amended regulations will take effect on October 1st. The agency exchange system has been in place for a long time in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, and has proven to be quite convenient. This is because the procedures for exchange banks to join are more difficult, unlike the agency exchange system, which is simple and easy to implement. Moreover, given the large number of banks established in various countries, if all of them were to join the exchange as members, the exchange procedures would be complicated and time-consuming, which would be difficult to arrange. Given the large number of banks, trust companies, and money shops established in Shanghai and the complexity of their habits, it would be even more difficult for the entire financial industry to participate in the exchange directly than in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Therefore, the need for an agency exchange system is self-evident. Now that the association has expanded the agency method, once it is realized, it is expected that all silver and money businesses in the city will use the agency exchange method, and the convenience of centralized settlement will be achieved.</p>

<h3>Unfounded Rumors Depress Bond Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the stock exchange was shaken by rumors reported in a certain newspaper. When the market opened in the morning, all parties were selling. Although there were buyers, the market felt fatigued and unable to rise. The bond market decreased by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. In the second session, there was some short covering, and the market price slightly recovered by about 0.2 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the above-mentioned varieties were still relatively stable. When the Unified Salt Tax Bonds were auctioned, a large amount of No. 41 was sold, and at the same time, No. 38 and others were bought, so the market price only fell slightly by about 0.2 yuan. The transactions were cleared at the close, and except for the drastic drop in the Disbandment Bonds of 0.3 yuan, the rest only fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. As a result, the market price fell by 0.1 to 0.6 yuan. Whether there will be changes in the political situation should be clear in a day or two. Judging by common sense, there should not be much of a problem. The total turnover was 7,743,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods and 2,825,000 yuan in Unified Salt Tax Bonds futures, 1,095,000 yuan in Disbandment Bonds, 745,000 yuan in 1928 Customs Bonds, 1,675,000 yuan in 1931 Customs Bonds, 1,000,005 yuan in the 1969 Loan Bonds, and the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to over 100,000 yuan. Most of the November futures have been opened, but no transactions have been made for the 1918 Customs Bonds.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Declines More Than Rises</h3>
<p>According to the New Fohong &amp; Co. report, the New York stock market on the 29th was still relatively stable. Due to concerns that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. stock may reduce interest, selling pressure was strong, falling by 3 points, which affected other stocks from rising. However, the pressure was not strong. There were rumors that the US President would stipulate the price of gold so that the value of the current US dollar would be equal to 60 cents, and that there would be a free gold trading market. Both of these rumors could not be confirmed, and gold mining stocks rose due to these rumors. The total volume of transactions for the day was 1,640,000 shares. The market situation tomorrow is still tending to be uncertain. The "wheat" market situation closed weak, mostly due to local pressure. The fundamental news is still good, and there is no need to worry about buying at low prices. As for "cotton," it is rumored that the government's cotton hedging has increased. There has been in-depth discussion of the government's credit enhancement and value enhancement plan. Brokers unanimously believe that if the plan progresses, the value will definitely rise. The current weak market situation is due to the lack of interest from buyers. The "silver" market situation was strong at the opening, but due to speculative trading, it became slack. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 94.24 Down 0.42</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 41.07 Down 0.53</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 25.11 Down 0.52</p>
<p>40 Bonds 83.94 Up 0.10</p>
<h3>Yarn Mills Aggressively Buying Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward, and the situation is tight. The mills are slightly increasing their purchases of existing yarn, which is exciting the market. A certain mill is aggressively buying in the market, and it is widely said that the mills have united to aggressively buy. Therefore, general non-industry participants are actively resisting short positions. At the same time, there is real demand from both Sichuan and Guangdong parties to purchase yarn, causing the market to be firmer. The future depends on the flexibility of current sales.</p>
<p>Man-Made Fiber Bids Rise by $1.80. When the man-made fiber market opened in the previous session, buyer demand was low due to poor atmosphere, and prices for all months were average. Suddenly, during the second and third sessions, the market tightened, and prices for all months rose by 0.358 to 1 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the current yarn business was good, and prices for all months rose again by 0.8 to 1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 42,500 bales. It was found that Yuan Dah sold 1,950 bales, Yee Cheng sold 2,400 bales, Yi Chang sold 2,100 bales, Hsieh Sheng sold 1,500 bales, Tung Ho sold 1,850 bales, and Thai Cheung sold 1,000 bales.

<p>Sichuan 700 Shantou 170 Northern Parties 10 Peers 15</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Buy on Dips</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose. However, the overseas cotton market was flat, and arrivals from various routes gradually became abundant. The price of cotton in the producing areas is falling daily. Villagers are experiencing economic difficulties and are unable to stockpile, so they all want to sell as the market dictates. As a result, selling prices have softened. However, Shanghai cotton merchants are generally in long positions and are buying on dips. The market trend is soft but firm. A certain manufacturer is selling off a large quantity of cotton in October, about 20,000 piculs.</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Soft But Firm When the Zheng cotton market opened in the previous session, the weather was good, US cotton was slightly lower for the day, and the arrival of Tong cotton was abundant. Mill transactions were not many, and the market outlook was weak. Prices for all months fell by 0.3 yuan. In the second and third sessions, long positions bought in, and prices rebounded. As a result, prices only decreased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was firm. A certain mill sold off in large quantities, and prices for all months rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 113,500 piculs.

<h3>US Cotton Slightly Declines Due to Hedging</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market initially rose due to public buying, and then fell due to hedging by southern parties and weakness on Wall Street. As a result, spot goods were unchanged, and futures fell by 1 to 9 points per pound. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot goods rose by 2 points, and futures rose by 5-6 points. In the Egyptian cotton market, spot goods rose by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering and buying by a few speculators. As a result, Pinggal was unchanged, Oomra fell by 0.25 rupees, and White Broach fell by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram records are as follows (telegram on the 29th):</p>

<h3>Active Sales of New Early Indica Rice in Grain Shops</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply was scarce, with only 20 deliveries. Market sentiment was slightly firm. However, given the festival season, grain shop sales inevitably had to offer discounts, and transactions were very slow. Fortunately, there were not many deliveries, and market prices continued to rise. Early indica rice from various areas was well-received by grain shops, and prices were high. The price of broken keng rice and aged early glutinous rice from various areas also increased by a few cents to a dollar. The thin rice from Qingpu, Songjiang, Zhujing, etc. was all purchased, and the price also rose by 0.1 yuan. The exchange rate also continued to rise by a few cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday there were over 10 deliveries, and the sales of various goods were still smooth. The market trend was that the price of broken keng rice was set. The prices of medium-grade broken keng rice, western new glutinous rice, white yuan rice, new aged early glutinous rice, and new glutinous rice increased by 0.1 yuan. The prices of eastern new keng rice, aged glutinous rice, and new Du rice were firm. The supply of thin rice was scarce, and the price increased by 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Price of Coarse Xian Rice Plunges After Sharp Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the xian rice market was still active, but due to the large number of arrivals in recent days, customers intended to wait and see before making purchases. Hunan coarse rice from previous deliveries had not yet been sold out. Yesterday, two new ships arrived, and most sellers wanted to sell off, so prices immediately fell. Medium-grade rice fell by 0.2 yuan, and high-grade rice fell by 0.15 yuan. Anhui and Fujian merchants jointly purchased 3,500 bags from Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Ningbo, etc., at prices of 5.75 yuan and 5.65 yuan, while medium-grade rice was at 5.45 yuan. Quanzhou merchants purchased 300 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice, at prices of 7.33 yuan and 7.12 yuan for the lower grade. Shantou purchased 684 bags of Nanjing machine-milled xian rice, at prices of 6.95 yuan to 6.7 yuan. Local merchants also purchased 434 bags of aged Nanjing xian rice, at prices of 6.5 yuan and 6.48 yuan. Market prices also fell by nearly 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>106,000 Bags of Flour Delivered in September</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for September flour futures. There was no market quotation. The delivery quantity was reportedly 106,000 bags, including 50,000 bags of Green Fort, 25,000 bags of Green Phoenix, 26,000 bags of Green Wheat Report, and 5,000 bags of Green Three Stars. It is heard that this batch of orders was mostly returned cargo. Since the market suddenly plummeted at the end of the month, spot goods outside the market were actually cheaper than the standard, so actual sellers were inquiring about it. It is said that all of them were purchased by short-covering parties.</p>
<h3>New Broad Beans Arrive</h3>
<p>丨Market Atmosphere Weak</p>
<p>Recently, new broad beans from various places have arrived, with approximately 7-800 bags of large and small beans counted. The sales of large beans are more active, so the market trend is high and flat, followed by soft. Yesterday, 65 bags of high-quality large beans from Ben Niu were sold at the market at a price of 4.4 yuan, and over 100 bags of large beans from Zhenjiang were sold at a price of 4.15 yuan, all purchased by the Guangdong merchants.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sales in Europe and America Plunge</h3>
<p>The strike at silk weaving factories in New York is at a deadlock. Rayon fabrics are taking the opportunity to dump their goods, and raw silk consumption has decreased sharply. Silk prices have plummeted. Yesterday, Gan Li &amp; Co. received a telegram from New York stating that White Filature, grade B, had fallen to the level of US$1.70 per pound. The converted price in Chinese currency is only 67-80 yuan per bale. The sale of Chinese silk to America is in an even more desperate situation. As for England and France,</p>
<p>Although There Were Point Purchases and Short Covering, the price suppression was quite strong. In the past three days, 80 bales of White Filature were purchased by Xinfu and others, and prices plummeted by 20-30 yuan. The foreign silk market is devoid of vitality.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Transactions are Not Prosperous</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had lackluster transactions and a flat trend. The guild's listed price for No. 24 coarse white spot goods was still quoted at 21.8 yuan. Over 100 bags that could be delivered tomorrow were traded at 21.65 yuan. There was some trading in No. 20 medium white sugar at 20.85 yuan. The quoted price for Dutch red sugar remained the same with no transactions. Taikoo sugar, B mark, was at 21.7 yuan, CW mark was at 0.55 yuan, DY mark was at 0.3 yuan, and HX mark was at 20.95 yuan. The quoted prices for China's Guohua No. 1 cotton sugar remained unchanged. If there is a buyer, it is hoped that the price can be slightly loosened. Local ice sugar, such as crystal ice sugar, was at 25.2 yuan, with the rest slightly lower. No. 1 ice sugar was at 24 yuan, No. 2 ice sugar was at 23.8 yuan, and No. 3 was at 22.9 yuan. Business Sutras (44)</p>
<h3>Wood Oil and Tung Oil</h3>
<p>Wood oil is soft and yellowish. If it encounters a southern wind, it dissolves into a pasty state. It is extracted from the tallow tree just like tung oil. Tung oil is extracted from the kernels of the tallow tree fruit. If the skin and kernels of the tallow tree fruit are pressed together, it becomes yellow and soft wood oil. The best quality is produced in Xiushan and 　yang areas of Sichuan. Jiaxing in Zhejiang is second best, and the worst is mixed 　wood oil from Jiangxi and Hubei. Currently, its use is limited to making candles and mixing into soap production. The annual production is about 100,000 dan. The quality distinction is determined by the firmness and whiteness, or softness and yellowness, and the presence of moisture. In the deep winter, it is often packed in straw bags or 　bags, but when spring arrives, it must be repackaged in 　containers to prevent melting.</p>
<p>Tung oil is produced in the same regions where tallow oil is found. (The tallow oil production areas were detailed in this newspaper on August 30th.) Its greatest use is as an additive to tung oil when the price of tung oil is high, as their quality and color are similar and difficult to distinguish. The annual production is about 300,000 dan. It is a liquid, and storage containers must be oil baskets or barrels to prevent leakage.</p>

<h3>Snake and Sphinx</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>When I was a child, my grandmother often told me jokes and all sorts of wonderful things. I loved listening to them, and I still remember many. One time,</p>
<p>she said there was a type of snake that ate people, but it had a rule. When it saw a person, it would first stand its body straight up and compare it to the person's height. If the person was not as tall as it, it would eat them; conversely, if the person was taller than it, it would fall to the ground and roll to its death. Therefore, this type of snake was most dangerous to children; however, there was a way to overcome it. That is, when its body has not yet stood straight, you quickly take a bamboo pole or other thin, long object and hold it straight up, making the top of the bamboo pole higher than the snake's head, and then the snake will admit defeat.</p>
<p>My little heart was greatly stimulated by this story. Later, when I went to walk in the mountains and fields, I was often apprehensive, but also very much hoping that this kind of snake would come out and challenge me. Of course, a wooden stick was always tightly clutched in my hand. However, I spent more than ten years in the countryside, and my curiosity and adventurous spirit were never satisfied.</p>
<p>Later, when I read 兩　Qiu Yu An's "Random Notes", I learned that the origin of this kind of snake was actually in Qiongzhou, Guangdong. I had never been to Qiongzhou, so no wonder I never encountered it. However, what was recorded in the "Random Notes" was slightly different from what my grandmother described. It was said that: "When the snake measures people, it cries: I am taller. The person should also respond: I am taller, and the snake will immediately fall and die." This made defeating it even easier, and even bamboo poles and wooden sticks would not be needed.</p>
<p>What this kind of snake reminded me of was the mythical sphinx of ancient Greece. This monster squatted on the road to Thebes, posed a riddle for people to guess. If they couldn't guess it, they would be eaten; if they guessed it, it would throw itself into the sea and die. Later, its riddle was finally guessed by King Oedipus, and the answer was "Man." The riddle was: "What animal walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?"</p>
<p>To challenge people without reason, to ask riddles without reason, to eat when victorious, although it is inevitable to be domineering, but to repay with one's life when one loses, without denial, is truly "acting directly." It is unexpected that this kind of monster is quite trustworthy.</p>
<p>In Chinese legends, there is also something similar to the Sphinx, found in the Classic of Mountains and Seas: "Beyond the Northwest Sea, north of the Red Water, there is Zhangwei Mountain: there is a deity with a human face and a snake body, who is red, with straight eyes and upright pupils. When he closes his eyes, it is darkness, and when he opens them, it is light... This is Zhujiuyin, also called Zhulong." Also, the commentary on the Songs of Chu says: "In the northwest of the heavens there is a dark country with no sun, where a dragon holds a candle to illuminate it." That is this thing, so this monster is a messenger of light.</p>
<p>After being frightened by human deceit and darkness, I very much want to be with these monsters.</p>
<h3>Prohibiting and Self-Manufacturing</h3>
<p>— Ru Niu</p>
<p>According to reports, because of the large number of imported pencils and fountain pens, some places are already prohibiting their use and switching back to writing brushes. Let's not talk about irrelevant things like airplanes and cannons not being domestic products, let's just talk about paper and pens.</p>
<p>We won't talk about famous people who write large characters and paint traditional Chinese paintings, let's just talk about real office workers. For these people, writing brushes are very inconvenient. An inkstone and ink can be dispensed with, and ink sticks can be used instead, but what kind of ink sticks are domestic? And according to my experience, ink sticks are not something that can be used frequently. After writing a few thousand characters, the writing brush will be glued up and unusable. If one sets up an inkstone and grinds ink, unfolds paper and wets the brush, then even in the case of students copying lecture notes, the speed will probably be reduced by a third compared to using a fountain pen. They would have to not copy, or have the teacher speak slowly, which means everyone's time is wasted by a third.</p>
<p>The so-called "convenience" is not laziness, it means that in the same amount of time, one can accomplish more things, which is saving time, which is making a person's limited life more effective, and which is equivalent to extending a person's life. The ancients said, "It is not the person who grinds the ink, but the ink that grinds the person," lamenting the waste of life in paper and ink, and the invention of the fountain pen is precisely to make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>But its existence must be in places where time and life are precious. This is not the case in China, of course, it won't be a domestic product. China has ledgers for imports and exports, but there is still no ledger for the number of people. How much material and energy do parents spend in raising and educating a single person, and yet young men and women often come to unknown ends, and no one pays attention. A mere amount of time is of course not a problem at all. Being able to live and play with a writing brush may even be a blessing, it's hard to say.</p>
<p>Like us Chinese, Japan has always used writing brushes. However, in Japan, writing brushes have almost disappeared, replaced by pencils and fountain pens, and there are many calligraphy practice books that use these pens. Why? Because they are convenient and save time. But aren't they afraid of "leakage"? No, they manufacture them themselves, and even ship them to China.</p>
<p>When something is excellent but not a domestic product, China prohibits it, and Japan imitates and manufactures it. These are two completely different approaches.</p>
<h3>New Autumn in an Island Nation</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Impressions of Qingdao, Part One</p>
<p>There, there is a light blue sky, and there, there is a deep blue sea. There is a paradise opened up by the Great German Empire for our wealthy merchants, young masters, and sons of nobility!</p>
<p>Summer is slowly ending, autumn has arrived, and the sea breeze is cool. Those who are escaping the summer heat are awakened from their dreams like a cold moon at the window, and they feel a touch of melancholy in their hearts. It seems that summer has gone too quickly, and the seawater bath has not been fully enjoyed...</p>
<p>Yes, summer there is worth cherishing.</p>
<p>The scorching wind cannot blow onto the island; there are no people dripping with sweat. Do you love to see mountains? Laoshan is not far away; do you want to play in the water? In front of you is a stretch of calm sea. You can have everything you want: dance halls, movie theaters, coffee shops... Everything that modern city dwellers need to enjoy has been carefully prepared for you.</p>
<p>When you have nothing to do, take a drive in a car; the road is clean and wide, undulating and winding along the mountain's slopes. On both sides of every road are dense locust trees like umbrellas, casting a belt of shade in the sunlight. It's a pity that the locust trees don't bloom in the summer; otherwise, the fragrant wind of locust flowers would fill your embrace.</p>
<p>Do you want to take a walk? Seaside Park, First Park, the choice is yours. Those parks are built for groups of young ladies and gentlemen, pairs of modern men and women strolling arm in arm. It is most suitable there. People with money who are escaping the summer heat always bring a companion of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>After lunch, take a nap and then go to Huiquan Bathing Beach!</p>
<p>The bathing beach there is the best in all of China! The seawater there is not muddy yellow, it is transparent blue　slice, far away against the Mo Yun Mountain, dotted with ochre-colored reefs in the middle. The sand is soft, yellow like gold. There are extremely many people, men, women, black hair that has been soaked in water, colorful swimsuits, bodies that are curved like mermaids: rolling in the waves, lying on the beach; laughter and voices are uttered at any time. There is no ethnic distinction, no national distinction, although there are more foreign men and women there than compatriots, you will not feel any different.</p>
<p>It is like this, floating in the waves, lying on the beach, letting the hot summer day sneak away. When you are tired, you can walk behind the beach. There are teahouses in the sparse green trees, go in and drink a glass of beer, or a bottle of Coca-Cola made from Laoshan spring water; Western music broadcast on the radio is inviting you. The blue sky turns into a black sky, and the blue sea turns into a black sea. The lighthouse on Little Qingdao flickers in the darkness: it's late!</p>
<p>The trestle bridge is lively at this time.</p>
<p>The trestle bridge: built so neatly, like a long dyke stretching straight into the middle of the sea. The waves under the bridge always sing mysterious songs. People are on the bridge, and the wind is at sea. The men and women who are strolling show the most leisurely posture. Occasionally, two or three girls walk shoulder to shoulder and laugh, a fragrant breeze passes, and behind them, one or two young men follow, pointing and commenting, making such a long, thousand-foot FollowShot. Love, comedy! The money belongs to the father, the time belongs to oneself, who else is worthy of being in love if the young men aren't?</p>
<p>There, there is a light blue sky, and there, there is a deep blue sea. There is a paradise opened up by the Great German Empire for my petty wealthy merchants, young masters, and sons of nobility!</p>
<p>Summer there is worth cherishing. But summer is slowly ending!</p>
<h3>Yuan Zhonglang as an Official (1)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>After reading the four volumes of Yuan Zhonglang's letters, I found one thing quite amusing, and that is Zhonglang's career as an official. His letters, according to Jiang Jinzhi's preface to "Collection of Unbinding", are "each word and each phrase, written directly with the brush as he desired, in various exquisite ways", and these letters, some are several hundred words long, others are dozens of words long, in short, flowing out from true feelings and real situations. This description of Zhonglang is very accurate. Even in his letters about being an official, it is enough for the reader to see how innocently he describes his own psychological state at any given moment. At first, being an official made him happy; therefore, when he was appointed magistrate of Suzhou County, he was extremely pleased and hurriedly wrote a letter "to the gentlemen of the same society", saying:</p>
<p>I have been appointed to Wu. If Wu has a magistrate like me, then the Five Lakes will have an elder, Dongting will have a lord, the wine will have a host, the tea will have a confidant, Monk Sheng will preach the Dharma, and the stone will have an elder. I only fear that the grain officials from five hundred li away will disturb me. The path of officials binds people, I do not know what the future will hold. I am writing to let you all know." At this time, Lang was a little carried away with himself, because being an official was an ideal and illusory realm for him. "Who doesn't enjoy being an official", "When I was young, I looked forward to being an official like looking forward to being an immortal", he repeatedly said in his letters. Later, this dream came true, he became the magistrate of Wu County, and this ideal fairyland was completely shattered by this stint as an official. He said that being an official was a hard thing, a painful thing, a heartbreaking thing. He believed that "my talent and knowledge are foolish, I am ultimately a person of the forest, and charging me with the people and the community is not my duty" (Draft for Returning Home), and that "being an official can really harm my life" (To Huang Qishi), and so he resigned. In a letter to Li Benjian, he described his feelings about being an official at this time, saying:</p>
<p>When I was young, I looked forward to being an official as if looking forward to being an immortal, enduring frost in the morning and heat in the evening, imagining that there would be endless glory. Once I got my hands on it, the taste was actually more frugal than being a scholar. As for the hardship and humiliation, it is no less than a hundred or a thousand times more, how can one not be devastated and give up the idea? It is like an infant who cries incessantly when he sees a wax sugar figure, but once he puts it in his mouth, he is afraid of spitting it out. The taste of being an official is just like this.</p>
<p>This is comparable to Zhonglang's confession of being an official. He no longer wanted to be an official, turning "admiration" into "aversion", and expressing his feelings to those immortal people who were still officials. He wrote a letter to Xu Shaoqing, saying:</p>
<p>Who doesn't enjoy being an official, only those with the truest feelings have no choice, but even then it is tasteless. When food is tasteless, even children know to spit it out; when being an official is tasteless, but one does not know to spit it out, one will inevitably vomit along with it, until one loses both body and life, this is what I worry about day and night.</p>
<p>Before being an official, Zhonglang saw being an official as extremely enjoyable, but after becoming an official, he felt that it was simply human hell, and it was better to leave his position and become a free and unrestrained poet. Little did he know that it was not easy to get an official position; it was not a simple matter to resign from it. This can be seen from his letter to Zhang Youyu. He said:</p>
<p>Being in a troubled county is like a monkey in a cage. If you want to get out, the owner will lock you up again; if you don't want to get out, it is not in your nature. You jump east and west, 𨁝</p>
<p>Zhonglang's resignation was actually not an easy matter. According to his letters, he was allowed to resign after seven requests. All seven "Requests to Leave Wu" are attached to the back of the letters. In the first request, he explained his illness and that his grandmother wanted him to return to the north. He　finally, he was a person of the forest, hoping to enable him to "return to his hometown early, so that even on the day of death, it would be like the year of life." The second request was a further oath, saying that if what he said in the resignation was "a single word of deceit, may the gods strike him down." The third request was another request, saying that if he could be allowed to resign, then it would truly be "heaven is high and earth is thick, how can his gratitude be exhausted." The fourth request was somewhat indignant, saying on the one hand that if he allowed him to resign, then "his remaining life would all be a gift from the Magistrate", and on the other hand expressing his determination, saying, "I would rather flee with my head in my hands and be a deposed civilian stripped of his position than wither and die in another land and be a starving ghost without support." The fifth request went further, saying, "I respectfully pack my bags and maintain my boat, awaiting the Magistrate's orders." The sixth request was the final determination, preparing to escape, he said angrily:</p>
<p>I already moved my wife, children, and luggage to the front path on the eleventh of this month, and I am alone in the house, waiting for the order to come down. I did not expect it to be delayed until now, with no news at all. My heart is more and more depressed, my hopes are becoming more and more isolated, and the fire is getting hotter and hotter, and the chills and fever are recurring. At this time, I am like a fish in a cauldron, unable to live and unable to die. After thinking it over and over again, the only way to preserve my body is to escape. Does the Magistrate must make me an abandoned person who discards his seal and is stripped of his official robes?</p>
<h3>The Passionate Child (4)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ge Mang and Sai Zuo Zhuying</p>
<p>After dinner, everyone played an old-fashioned card game, and Miss White also engaged in this old-fashioned game with her girlish charm, so the trembling Luo Zhe peeked at the cards coming out of the bag, arranged his cards, reported four　with a mischievous expression, and reported five numbers with a triumphant expression! How different this was from playing that pitiful, lifeless game with his grandmother in the yellow light of a candle. "But you see he's stealing all our money, this cheat."</p>
<p>He covered White's cards with a quick, fiery glance, making up for the oversights, and as a result, thanks to his help, she won completely: "This is a dowry," she said as she collected the money, "You helped me earn it, Luo Zhe, let's split it."</p>
<p>It was time to go home; every feast must come to an end. Luo Zhe stood up, very distraught, his throat felt like it was blocked by something, and he reached out to her. Madame Capelle looked at him and couldn't bear it, so she said: "Alright, don't hesitate, hug and kiss her, since you are so eager." She lifted the child up and placed him on the table, and the tall, twenty-something girl smiled and offered her face to him. Then, a happiness that had never been experienced before flowed through him like a ray of dawn; he closed his eyes and brought his burning lips close to her cheeks, which were softer than flowers; a congestion rising from his chest disappeared into that vermilion kiss; in that one second, he felt like he fainted. Compared to the complete bliss of this virgin first love, everything the poets say seemed pale and insignificant. Every passionate kiss he gave to others afterwards was just a bland and tasteless sensuality compared to this kiss.</p>
<p>Ten years later, he saw her again, by which time she was a gorgeous young woman. He thought he had forgotten her. But the memories that ten years of time could not erase slipped through his heart like a childhood wisp of smoke. He remembered again that flower-like kiss on his lips. He brushed his eyes with his hand, supporting himself forcefully, not letting himself fall... (End)</p>
<p>Appendix: The authors of this novel, Jean Gaument and Camille Ce, are both men of letters from the old capital of Normandy, Rouen, with university degrees. Although their fates have been harsh, and they have repeatedly lost the glory of obtaining literary prizes such as the Goncourt and Balzac by a difference of one or two votes, their works are actually very worthy of reading. When they first published short stories, they won the sympathy of readers because of their artistic sincerity and their beautiful emotions, sharp and delicate observations.</p>
<p>Their works are often full of the charm of the homeland that makes people yearn for, depicting the lives of provincials, and in many places, they can be compared to Balzac; but compared to Balzac, there is more lovely gentleness and melancholy.</p>
<p>Both of them are now only around fifty years old, which, in the eyes of Westerners, means that they still have a great future.</p>
