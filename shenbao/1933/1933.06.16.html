<p>時評</p>
<h3>棉麥借欵之用途　明</h3>
<p>本月十四日行政院長汪精衛氏之公開談話。聲明此次棉麥借欵。决不使吾國農產物受停滯之影響。又根據「實業計劃。」謂將確定用途。以此欵改進農業生產。整頓農業交通。且將集中於新農業之建設。此種負責談話。足以袪除一般人之疑慮。設使棉麥借欵之用途。果能盡如汪氏所期。則此五千萬美金。直今日行將崩潰之農村之救星矣。我國近年以來。國民經濟。衰頹逹於極點。農村破產。尤爲可慮。大借欵成功消息傳來之初。贊成者喜其於我國民經濟。可以有所補益。懐疑者則懼其影響本國農產物之價格。今汪氏之談話。表示當局將避逸一般人所焦慮之弊害。此吾人所樂於聆聞者也。</p>
<p>此次棉麥借欵。所獲得者爲棉花及小麥。紡紗廠及麵粉廠。可因此得一新轉機。而困頓之農村。亦或有蘇甦之可能。且陜西天災奇重。數百萬農民。流離失所。政府以此大批外麥。對該地作長期低利之借貸。則二三年後。陜省元氣。不難恢復。至於北部諸省。如津東之兵災。甘肅河南等省之瘠苦。山西之經濟枯涸。政府倘能藉。此次大借欵。爲有計劃的設。施亦可以解其當前之厄難。江西湖北。赤禍未除。影響所及。人民不能維持其最低限度之生活。此大宗棉麥。以　一部。分轉貸於人民。則沿長江農民得。一生機。於剿共之進行。亦不無裨益也。</p>
<p>惟吾人猶不免於杞憂者。我國舉借外債。民元以還。已非一次。大都用爲軍費。甚至輾轉而仍流入於外國銀行之存欵賬上。流弊所至。養成人民畏懼外債之心理。今國民政府舉借革命成功後之第一次外債。吾人深望政府能實踐負責人之所言。確定將此項借欵。用於改進農業生產。以挽救當前國民經濟之危局也。</p>

<h3>總辯論昨日告結束</h3>
<p>俄代表正式提議經濟休戰　　經濟貨幣兩委會主席推定（倫敦）經濟會議今晨十時三十四分續開大會時、因英美對於六月份戰僨巳臻同意、會塲空氣頓有顯著之進步、麥唐納因事未到、比外長希孟主席、葡外長逹麥泰演說、聲明一俟國際貨幣匯價規定之後、葡國即將回復金本位、但葡政府仍保留决定葡幣所含黃金成分之權、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>中國財政部長宋子文繼之登壇演說、謂中國挾與世界各國合作共覓解决世界經濟危局的永遠方法之誠懇志願前來參加此會、當前問題誠屬困難、但若應以正直之精神與必要之决心、則此難題並非爲人類所不能解决者、與會者負有重大責任、蓋成功之報酬與失敗之懲罰皆未可計算也、大會失敗、不獨將延長憔悴景象、且將使負有管理世界之責者、喪失信用、大會成功、則將導成更大而更穏定之繁榮時代云、宋氏繼於陳說中國準備與他國合作之政策大綱、及中國所能提出之特殊貢獻時、言及中國地位中之主要原素、謂他國生產過剩、而中國由生產不給·發展不足·及購買力薄弱、試以中國之發展與美國相較、中國僅有鐵路七千哩、而美國則有二十七萬五千哩、中國有汽車大道二萬哩、而美國則有三百萬哩、其他工商業發逹之形式、亦復彼此懸殊、中國對外貿固巳增多、但以其人口計之、仍屬甚微、查在一九三二年僅逹國幣四十萬萬元之數字耳參加此會之國家、有對外貿易每戶扯計約及英金一百五十鎊者、而中國則每戶僅七先令左右耳、中國者、乃天然利源雖未開闢、但甚覺富、而人民勤勞奮勉、佔世界人口五分之一之國也、中國地位如此、今後將如何乎、第一、中國生活程度如果提高、如吾人所欲爲者、則其購買力不獨可吸收舉國自已工業之出產、且可爲世界最大之商塲、而成繁榮新時代中之極大要素、第二、中國有最大可能的機會、供中外資本之生利的運用、想世界政治才能定能覓一方式與方法、而符合孫中山總理一面鞏固中國政治與經濟獨立、一面供給西方資本與工商業以有利的發展範圍之主張也、宋氏繼言中國在政策與行爲上之貢獻、謂各國第一工作、在各自穏健設立其自己制度、第二工作、在與他國合作一種穏健的世界政策、在毋庸細述之各種困難中、中國確有理由以某種成積自詡、中國現政府得人民之贊助=巳使一九三二年收支預算相抵、且對於整理內鑛巳告成功、宋氏繼言曰、余非欲諸君由此推論、以爲吾人能注意一九二七年國民政府成立以前中國所借之各種外債、其中確間有未履行者、然中國政府旣巳在國難內患世界經濟恐慌及外敵侵略之秋、不借外債、克自支持、則他日此種困難一部成全部銷滅時、中國之淸償其正當債務、固非不可能事、亦由此可知矣、中國巳成就復築一九三一年大水所毀長江堤岸之大工程、監視此工程者、有中國技師四千人、而其所指揮之工人、有時逹一百四十萬人、堤長五千哩、工程頗固、一九三二年雖有大水、迄未爲患前年四千三百萬人所集居之區域、爲水淹沒、去年則農作豐收矣、國聨對此難題、曾予中國以技術上有價値之襄助、而在其他經濟問題上亦多所扶助、此乃可欣然陳述者也、宋氏旋言及銀問題、謂西方現感受貨幣價値逐日波動致碍及對外貿易之困難、而思在此大會中有以解除之、中國實亦有此同樣困難、因中國貨幣雖屬金類物、然銀價在其對金幣與非金幣之關係</p>
<p>中有劇烈之波動也、銀價現甚低落、渠個人希望在他種物品以金相較價値漲起時、銀價亦將漲起、渠以爲銀之穏定的價値、較諸銀價之漲高更爲重要、故渠希望在謀取金幣之穏定時、亦當爲銀謀取穏定、蓋銀乃中國數萬萬人民之通貨、且亦印度民庶甚有關係之物也、宋氏繼略述中國所顧採行之合作方針、謂中國有少數人、其他亞洲國有多數人、咸信亞洲無須效法他人、而西方亦無足畏、並主張西方技術與東方生活低程度之合併、以爲如是可奪取世界巿塲、且藉「亞洲爲亞洲人之亞洲」·及所謂「亞洲門羅主義」之名義、而屏絕西方之合作、實則此種主義與吾華人國際往來之觀念相反、吾人不欲採用此種主義、吾人且將反對國家或地方之孤立、此爲吾人政策、此爲吾政府發展中國銷費力之一定方針、吾人欲改造國家、俾可提高其生活程度·經濟之發展·與吾國利源之開拓乃吾人時常所最注意者、吾人欲以可增進國際合作之方法成就此目的而獲其益、吾人歡迎西方資本與技能、並顧維持可不阻止外貨入境之理財政策、中國自解脫不合時宜的條約限制、而恢復其完全關稅自主之權以來、今已數載、中國迄未用此自由以建築保護性質之關稅壁壘、不僅此也、中國且欲視世界爲一個經濟單位、庶各國可依最適合其人民本能及其能力性質之邊線而謀發逹、中國殊不欲採行經濟自給之空談也、中國稅則較他國稅則大都爲低、關稅之征收、純爲國家收入起見、凡知中國直接稅之困難者、當知中國關稅之所以爲重要也、中國對於貿易並未加以如限額等之限制、銀價雖跌、政府雖因此而感困難、然亦未採行匯兌上之限制、吾人將遵守不作人爲的限制之政策、蓋確信吾人於此不獨可增加與世界之利益、且可推進余頃所言經濟發展政策後所有之廣大社會與政治旨趣也、中國自信根據此種原則、以進行其改造、當可在其進行中獲取最大可能的襄助、而成一個新的大巿場、其潛蓄之銷費力或可爲促成整個世界的眞正與永遠恢復之要素、雖此會天然以討論經貨幣問題爲、限但此問題與軍縮問題實有關聨、尤與國家安全問題有關、若欲將此互有關係之事件分別而隔斷之、殆不可能、若軍縮安全問題未亦有美滿解决、而吾人遽以爲此會成功堪以耐久、則吾人實缺乏了解實際之知識矣云云（十五日路透電）</p>

<p>互爭貨幣委員會主席（倫郭）路透外交訪員探悉、世界經濟大會之幕後、現正進行劇烈之衝突、蓋法美兩國均力爭貨幣委員會主席一位、各不相讓、自星期二日至今猶未解决、法國謂此位如屬於美國、則有導成膨賬政策之危險云、此事若不能以討論决之、則恐將提付表决、但雙方均欲避免出此步驟、十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>英實業聨合會通過决議案</h3>
<p>促政府鼓勵提高銀價（倫敦）經濟會議中各代表演說與私人聞談話、對於白銀之注意、迄今尙未能如一般擁護白銀派所期望、據數代表言、將來俟委員會提出貨幣問題時將予白銀以詳細討、論目下無在演說中申論之必要、又聞會中巳接有英實業聨合會（全國主要商行之代表團體）所送决議案稱、白銀跌價大足以減少中國印度對於製造品之需求、應請英政府的議恢復銀價、世界經濟會議盡力鼓勵採用增加銀價之切實可行的方案、並穏定金銀比價云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>大會之第三日赫爾演詞全文</h3>
<p>（倫郭）昨日英相麥唐納籲請各代表準時到會、各代表皆予聽從、故今日午後繼續開會之鐘點至時、會塲業已人滿、衆皆引領待聆美國務卿赫爾與俄外委李維諾夫之演詞、午後三時逾三分、大會續開、赫爾徐步登演壇時、衆咸歡呼、赫爾吐詞緩而淸晰、</p>
<h3>責任綦重</h3>
<p>謂擾攘不寗之世界、現仰望大會爲其指導、列國集此名都、應付同遭之危難、可謂恰當其時、六十五國遴選代表參與此會、其迫切之需要、可以悲慘之經騐表示之、茍此大會默然而散、表示吾人不能製成充分新政策、及戰後所行摧毀國家搗亂世界的經濟政策尙須繼續實施、則吾人豈不辜負各地人類加諸吾輩之委託、</p>
<h3>孰願任咎</h3>
<p>設有一國、偏重其一方暫時利益、而無期延誤各國受難者之救濟、致破壞此會、則此國家應由世界人類鳴鼓而攻之、余對於大會左右世界之材能權方與旨趣、有完會信任、如大會成立一種程序、協同各國國內之適當程序恢復各國之信任工作與繁榮、則此大會可告功成云、</p>
<h3>經濟浩刧</h3>
<p>赫爾繼陳述近年來世界擾攘之慘象、謂今日人類較諸十二年前更覺困苦不安、凡參加此會者、自始當覺各地受苦人民期望此會有和諧合作與建設之結果、此會之成敗將爲各處政治手腕之成敗、而在此緊急時代之失敗、將在歷史中永遠顯著、吾人所公認者、經濟浩刧及其相隨而來之損失苦惱與艱辛、爲吾人歷史所未前有者、已加諸各國與全世界、三年半於茲矣、國庫涸竭、物價崩潰、國際金融與商業皆告破壞、國內出產與消費俱已大减、工人失業逹三千萬人、農業破產、貨幣與匯兌到處紊亂債臺高築、捐稅奇重、凡此皆爲近年來之痛苦經騐也、</p>
<h3>稅壁障碍</h3>
<p>一國在相當限度上、固能以相當金融與經濟方法恢復狀况、如羅斯褔總統國內程序所表示者、但國際經濟程序之必要、不因此而稍减、戰後經濟的國家主義、採行阻撓國際資金與貿易之種種方法、以致國際貿易由五百萬萬元减至一百五十萬萬元、戰後所採目光短淺而無充分智慮之政策、以期將各種物價减至取低程度者、其慘惡之結果、由此可覩焉、各國制定其稅則時、僅注意於保護國內巿塲、而不注意於過剩生產之交易、今者已至各國政府停築藉以報復之關稅壁壘之時矣、</p>
<h3>根本要圖</h3>
<p>各國在實質上互有關係、故國際合作、在今日巳成根本上必要之　、吾人應宣布各國所採之經濟的國家主義、乃一種喪失信用之政策、相互有益之巿塲、僅能以商業政策之解放得之、</p>
<h3>商業解放</h3>
<p>而解放之　、端賴各國政府以同樣行動穏定匯率與通貨、並將關稅障碍作相當之減除而逹之、各國固能以相當金融經濟辦法、自已恢復狀况至相當程度、故羅斯福政府在三個月內採行有效力的國內程序、以促進事業之進步、至充分可能的地位、同樣重要的國際救濟計畫、有同樣的需要、此爲顯而易見者、</p>
<h3>整理稅則</h3>
<p>赫爾主張對於過分的稅則、及其他貿易上障礙旋行逐漸而愼重的整理、改至和緩的程度、旣不容不、合情理或逾量的竸爭性質之輸入、亦不獨亨本國巿塲價格上之利益、此種政策、可獲取較穏健而較繁榮之狀態、雖不符合極端經漳的國際主義、然亦不附和極端經濟的國家主義、且可以廣大國外巿塲、輔助有效的國內巿塲戰後所行之經濟的國家主義、凡人類所知陰撓國際資金與貿易之方法、無不採用、如苛稅·限額·禁令·匯兌限制·及賤値通貨之限制等是也、許多政府時常改變其稅則、及其他阻撓辦法、以致舉棋不定、商業大受損害此種貿易上障礙、處處使生產工作價格及國內貨物支配受不良之影響、在此種種極端行爲之摧殘下、世界有許多地方、人民嗷嗷待哺者以千百萬計、而又有許多地方則食物剩餘、無人吸收、原料與工廠相隔、銷費人與工廠相隔、而食物又與銷費人相隔、試問有幾許國家未有國際貿易而能入持者乎、</p>
<h3>穏定通貨</h3>
<p>大會亦必須應付永久的國際貨幣標準之困難問題、而規定金銀之適當功用、及此種標準之運用、外匯限制亦宜設法取銷、美代表團準備對於上述各種問題予以具體建議、國際巿塲之衰落、足損毀大輸出國這經濟與金融上生活、而使一切對外貿易失其常態、且碍及各種生產、並喪失數千萬勞動家之職業、此乃觀於近來恐慌事態而可知者、</p>
<h3>利已損人</h3>
<p>南美多數拉丁國向來將其生產售於國外、其額自百分之三五至百分之八五、觀此尤可見國際貿易必不可少之性質、英倫必售出百分之二五、德國加拿大與澳洲必各售出百分之三O、紐絲倫必售出百分之四O、而日本亦必售出百分之四五至六五、國際交易今巳成爲例外而非常規、各國皆欲售出而不買進、各欲輸出而不輸入、各欲剝削他人而利自已、此種矛盾的行爲之必有結果、爲世界巿塲貨物買賣之價格跌至最低度、</p>
<h3>影響物價</h3>
<p>其影響遍及於各國物價、各國人民旣莫能運輸其貨物、以抵付其差額、國內金融之結構、乃爲之動搖、而通貨匯兌亦爲之不定矣、</p>
<h3>矛盾行爲</h3>
<p>此種行爲、無論其爲攻勢的、或守勢的皆使各國事業减至人爲的基礎之上、而逼世界入於經濟戰爭之中、極端主張戰後所行之有害的政策者、基於錯誤的自私或無理的恐慌之精神、始終要求少與他國作經濟上之接觸、其口號爲符咒家所謂之繁華、以爲國家閉關自守、可致富强、而人民亦可食肥衣足、對於不購本國自製之物者、以不愛國目之、至於物價之高低不問也、其製定稅則也、僅注重國內巿塲之保護、縱至保護無效率的或顯然不合經濟的實業中無效率的私人營業之程度、亦所不恤、至於彼此以互換手續流通其過劑的生產之道、則不加以思索也、國內巿場、乃與世界巿塲不通聲氣、而物價起落自行擅定、亦與他國物價漠不相關、</p>
<h3>國際合作</h3>
<p>但在今日非已至各國政府應停築關稅壁壘、終止其歧視與報復行爲之時期乎、試實之知識巳迨人承認國家在經濟意識上彼此維繫、休戚相共、故其結果、國際合作在今日巳成根本必要矣、</p>
<h3>成功之鑰</h3>
<p>僅僅反對自私之政策、未能表示其避免或阻止或療治事業史是最有破壤性質的憔悴之能力、故大會必能規定切實處理此種艱難之計劃、和平繁榮及人類進步之美滿條件、在國際商業之維持、大會必須明白表示有文化的國家是否能漠視此種經濟事實、而規避此事實所需要之責任、各國茍皆採行一種政策、對於逾量的稅則及其他貿易上障礙、加以逐漸愼重的調節、減至和緩的程度、一方面旣不容無理或過分的外來竸爭、以不利於本國在常狀下所經譬之有效率的工業、一方面亦不獨亨本國內價格上利益、則定可保障各國內各種有效率的實業、更穏健與更繁榮之狀態、此種遠大程序、旣不同極端經濟的國家主義、亦異於經濟的國際主義、而可使各國咸處於中庸之道、蓋彼此交換各以廣大國外巿塲、輔助其有效率的國內巿場也、世界不能照目前進行之方式繼續前進、此會成功、乃一般貿易恢復之鑰、</p>
<h3>打破孤立</h3>
<p>輿論尙未充分了解用以扶助國際經濟合作之必要程序、但人民受苦已極、輿論不久必被喚起以援助此程序、各國不理會各種實際、奮力進行經濟孤立之政策、各自愚妄的謀求、不問世事之隠士生活、主張經濟孤立者所抱各國自爲謀可以自拔之思想、今已說明無效、試稍察現有難題、及造成難題之種種情形與勢力、即可證此說之不謬、各國皆有恐慌之降臨、而主張孤立者、則視爲偶有事、蓋在主張孤立者觀之、任何恐慌皆未有國際性質·國際原因·或國際洽療法也、</p>
<h3>貿易原則</h3>
<p>任何一國欲自己担任大減國稅或銷除交易限制、或鞏固其外匯幣價、或恢復國際信用與商業結構、勢必極感困難、余於此願再聲明一種原則、歸國家間貿易並非將一國已成立的國內生產與貿易代以他國的生產與貿易之謂是、國際貿易大都爲各國過剩貨物彼此直接或間接作有利的交換之謂、並含蓄進取的國家趨入世界覓取原料而製成貨品之意味、目前三千萬失業工人如何可恢復工作、破產的農業如何可恢復穏健、憔悴的工業如何可恢復常態、絕無他種方法、世界不能照其目前進行之方式繼續前進、故在余觀之大會成功、乃一般事業康復之鑰也、雖目前未有充分了解之輿論、以扶助世界經濟合作之必要程序、但余確信各國人民所遭之損失與痛苦、巳逹極度不久將喚起輿論對於此種程序以積極援助也、</p>
<h3>立下决心</h3>
<p>日前第一與最大之工作、爲此會塲中謀取各國救濟困苦的志願與决心之發展、此後計畫與方法可陸續成形具體、余所切禱者、爲合作精神、俾在會中成立一致的指導與程序、而使世界中不可紀數的受苦人民獲有希望、與會各國表示其誠意之初步、在立即全體遵守巳有十餘國遵守之關稅休戰、而至此會結束爲止、</p>
<h3>共策復興</h3>
<p>一個完全程序、應一一具載國際合作之方法與計畫、所有商業上障碍應悉撤除、所有不公的貿易方法與習慣應皆廢止、各國應同時致力於此、而採用其所能籌出之種種有效方法、以處理此難題、以言貨幣範圍、適當計畫必須採行、以期成立可立即實行之政策、俾在經營基礎工作謀取永久改良之時期中、予貨幣以可能的最大穏固辦法、同時各國必須振興其天然資力與工作、以發動工商業之輪軸、而養成銷費家之能力、庶物價得以提高、</p>
<h3>願有貢獻</h3>
<p>美國代表團準備貢獻關於上述各種問題之具體建議、凡派員與會之國家皆最注重和平與繁華、而和平與繁華之必要條件、在經濟政策之適當的整理、經濟的衝突除若干例外、乃危及世界和平之最嚴重而永遠的原因、</p>
<h3>致力和平</h3>
<p>故此會具進行增進與成立經濟的和平之偉大工作、蓋經濟的和平乃一切和平之根本也云云、赫爾發言時、會塲中人極擁擠、迨其詞由舌人轉譯法語時、凡知英語之代表多退入應接室、互相評論美國務卿之言論、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫郭）今日世界經濟大會全體會議、各代表之注意、咸集中於英財相張伯倫與美國務卿赫爾之演詞、午後開會、赫爾演說畢即離會、於是塲中美代表團席上、幾空虛無人、英相麥唐納亦離會、但未幾復回就座、時捷克斯拉無代表皮尼士正在演說也、次阿眞廷代表李白里頓簡明發表南美之見地、次匃牙利代表伊姆里第述匃國之意見、謂匃國之淪於今日困難地位、實由大戰後國土分裂、及農產品價格大落所致、匈國今續需外國資本、伊氏又述及一九三二年匈國輸出品之總値、猶不滿償債所需之欵數、伊氏協同其他代表力主因外匯管理之所發生一切障碍、應從速銷除之云、次荷蘭首相柯里恩博士致詞、對於金本位之回復是否可能、表示疑慮、並力促應即設法使貨幣價格之波動不越所規定之限度、柯氏贊成張伯倫所主張之廢止航業津貼、並建議應採行比荷新訂商約所含諸原則、以求貿易之增進、又謂貨幣之穏定、茍非輔以貨物之自由流通、則事必歸於失敗云云、柯氏致詞畢、大會乃宣布延會至星期四晨續開、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>到期欠美戰債</p>
<h3>張伯倫向下院宣布美接受英國建議</h3>
<p>允先還什一計一千萬美金用銀償付每盎司作價五角羅覆稱不欲妨礙經濟會進行全部戰債結構留待日後解决</p>
<h3>法比波蘭準備愆付</h3>
<p>（倫敦）財相張伯倫今晚在下院宣布羅斯福總統已接受英國之申請、將六月十五日到期欠美之戰債先還美金一千萬元、而以白銀每凈盎司作價五角償付、所需之銀已向印政府購得、張伯倫繼稱、英政府曾申請在戰債問題未作整個討論之際、六月份到期之欵、宜准展緩繳付、惜美總統不予接受、惟羅斯福總統已以合作精神接受英國先還債欵一部分、而不損礙美政府或異日討論之自由、六月十五日到期之欵、所以繳付一部分者、蓋冀藉此使該問題在下批債欵到期之前而得解决之道也、財相繼謂洛桑公約旣使對英負債國中止繳付債欵、則英國對此巨債、斷難源源償還、故若再行償還、則即將使洛桑公約失效、而上年甫經獲救之世界、又將淪於擾攘絕望中矣、第英政府固極不欲取含有否認其義務之任何步驟云、財相於是宣讀羅斯福總統在華盛頓發表之文告內稱、債務問題之正式申請、宜展緩至日後、世界經濟大會之會務、决不可使之因關於債務周折延久之討論而受妨礙、茲因英國之申請、及此次付欵、乃表示對債項之承認、故羅總統特在其文告中宣布渠毫無猶豫聲明渠不以因此償付所釀成之局勢爲不履行義務云、財相演詞之結語、謂英美對於此事之妥協、實爲世界經濟會議成功之佳兆、且爲趨向債務問題完全最後解决之第一步驟云、於是下院四座、歡呼之聲大作、繼由克里浦斯代表工黨·薩繆爾表自由黨·向財相致賀、並對羅斯福總統之見解、表示深切之欽佩、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>白宮致英覆牒</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日美總統已贊同舉行特別會議、冀可修改英欠戰債全部辦法、並在此時接受六月到期欵一部份、而不認英國爲愆付國家、美總統在正式復文內、允以每盎斯作價五角之協定價格、接受白銀一千萬元、並聲明渠曾建議一俟便時、英國可立即設法討論全部戰債結構、但其時期當在將近十二月份解欵到期以前、渠願於討論全部問題而將結果送交國會考慮、惟亦重申其不當在世界經濟會議討論戰債之主張、美總統又在復文內聲稱、渠亦確知英外部所述全數償付之危險、承認去年十二月英國全數償付後、世界物價隨起慘跌、按英國國會內曾稱、六月份到期欵若全數照解後、將使物價益跌、且此次解欵、適値世界匪濟會議開幕之際、可謂不巧之極、英國希望不致發生戰債難於圓滿解决之疑慮、阻碍會議之進行等語、美總統則表示渠覺允諾討論戰債結構、及將其結果送交國會之後、當可在會議中發生一較佳之感想、至關於解决戰債計劃、究屬何種性質、則美國復文與英國去牒俱未表示、美商務總長羅浦昨夜曾有總統將作驚人新提議之說、今日羅氏旣不願再加以說明、美總統亦未提及、除非其所稍驚人者、係指接受一部份付欵而言、則料此種提議俟雙方開正式談判時、當能有所表示、（十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>德奧關係緊張</h3>
<p>路透十四日維也納電官方宣稱、因近數日來發生之事件、德奧兩國間之關係已日臻緊張、維也納及其他各地之暴動均指爲國家社會黨所爲、因此有大批國家社會黨員被捕、自希特勒代表哈比赫在林資被補後、柏林奧使館情報部長華塞巴克亦以被補聞、各方咸認此爲德人對於哈比赫被補之一種報復手段、其後華氏使被釋出、但逼令立出德境、據官方宣稱、在華氏出境以前、曾被逼在一紙上簽字、聲明本人巳被遞奪證書、並須立即出境云、奧政府對於華氏所受之待遇、認爲違反外交官特權慣例、此間官塲宣稱、哈比赫之事件並不能與此事並論、蓋哈迄未經奧政府承認、但華氏則爲外交團中之正式人員云、哈比赫在林資被補後即絕食、但不久即被釋放、由奧國警察押往邊境云、奧總理杜爾夫斯巳委在華塞巴克爲駐英奧使館情報部長、並加委使館秘書銜、令其立即赴任云、</p>
<p>路透十四日維也納電據印斯白魯克官方消息、自國社黨於六月十一擬暗殺泰羅爾自衛團長晚梯蒂以後、又有一百二十名國社黨領袖被補、泰羅爾都會空氣仍極緊張、</p>

<h3>西北角上的馮玉祥（四）國安</h3>
<p>（四）始終服從中央的馮占海在下行五點鐘的時候、我冒着雨、踏着爛</p>
<p>泥、立在橋東面的大佈告板下、很小心的讀完了我們基督將軍就抗日同盟軍總司令職的大佈告、我可惜沒有抄錄下來、大槪的意思、就是中國現在內憂外患、交相壓迫的時候、濼東的敵人、得寸進尺、中國目前唯一的出路、就是實行抗日、所以原文內有、『玉祥身爲軍人·········滬粵民」</p>
<p>衆·········、信使頻還········、不得巳·········『、我看完了佈告、忽然想起那回張久榮代表所說的、』馮先生一定受民衆的擁護『想就爲此事呀、</p>
<p>事情證明了、二十六號這天、不是一定爲繳六十三軍一部分的槍械、原來是基督將軍就同盟軍總司令的日子、所以情形這樣的緊張、而事變又來的這樣突兀、張家口的緊張空氣、到下午五點鐘時、總算慢慢的恢復了常態、我們基督將軍在這一天內、是抗日武力第一步的開始、吉鴻昌一躍而爲張家口的警備司令、省政府和軍警機關、都用槍垾接收完竣、當天由北平開出的特別快和普通車、都被方振武扣留在宣化、很簡單而又明瞭地、張家口是交通斷絕了、巿內的電話雖通、可是電報照樣的暫行停止、這時我覺得最模糊的事情、就是六十三軍馮占海軍長、到底是怎麼樣的態度、同時這一部分隊伍、不知被同盟軍繳了械沒有、於是我喊了一部黃包車、到下堡二條巷四號馮軍長公館去、打聽自己所疑問的事情、</p>
<p>這時天還沒有晴、六點多鐘已經覺得有些昏暗了、我到了馮軍長的公館、請那傳逹副官、遞進去一張片子、原來那位張久榮先生、剛剛受着總司令使命、和馮占海軍長有所商確、我只得坐在一間小房間裏靜靜的等着吧、隔壁的屋裏、就是軍長和張先生談話的所在、因爲他們談話的聲音很大、所以我就聽個大半、何况那位張久榮先生的大喉嚨、在這時又特別的來得放大、同時談話帶着笑聲、這笑聲是張先生一個人的、但這笑聲裏是含着一種勝利的表情、所以他那豪放奔馳似的大笑、在這小院落裏激蕩着、我靜靜的聽着的、</p>
<p>『這次馮先生的舉動的確是老早就準備好丁·········、（聲音低下去）』緊接馮軍長很堅决的聲音、『我是抱定始終抗日的、同時無黨無派』、哈哈哈······、一陣笑聲是張先生的、笑完了說、『對了、你是始終抗日、馮先生這是就因爲抗日、才這樣的行動呵、我們是站在一條戰線上的呵、』馮軍長停了半天說、『抗日是人人都知道的、但是我們六十三軍對於中央、絕對服從、『』呵、壽山（馮占海字）、你怎麼這樣的模糊、·········聲音又低下、隠約約聽到中央···字樣、）』這時忽然靜默了半天、外面零落的雨聲、和晚風相衝擊着、東廂房裏冒出很濃的炊烟來、我慢慢的望着那坑墻底下的烟火、一面極力的用耳朶聽着、忽然隔壁的笑聲又起、但仍是張先生的、始終沒有引起馮占海軍長的共鳴、笑聲溜過去、馮軍長的說話聲音傳過來、『我姓馮的、從東北打到熱河、領着數萬東北的子弟、和日本人拼命、現在中央政府把我們改編爲正式軍隊、現在呌我怎能忘記了故鄕的敵人和政府的待遇、所以我寗肯保有我們過去抗日的光榮戰史、現在就頭斷了也不可惜的、『堅决的尾音、這時又靜默下去了、我呆呆的等着張先生、他也不走、太陽是在陰雲裏沒落了、我再要留戀下去、就不能夠出下堡的城門、於是三脚兩步的離開馮軍長的公館、出了下堡的南門、泥濘的街道上、正擁滿了六十三軍的一部分騎兵、還有許多的大車、每個人被雨淋的都像落蕩鷄一樣、人餓、、馬肝皮裏也沒有草、在那街道上打着旋轉不知到什麼地方去好、我費了很大的力氣從這些人業馬脚中鑽出來、一過橋看到這些部隊最末尾、還跟着同盟軍一隊的武裝兵、但那些人的臉上、並沒有異樣的表情、天黑民了、雨雲低低的向大地上壓迫着、我回旋館裏、作着那自已都不明白的夢、可是第二天、馮占海軍長的公館門前、巳經增加了同盟軍的衛兵了、我看到這樣的事實、忽然眼前現出這樣兩個大字、『軟禁』、（未完）</p>
<h3>日本之所謂大陸政策</h3>
<p>爲二次世界大戰準備將犧牲中國爲其戰塲先在我國土設國防綫日本對華、向取積極、所謂大陸政策、由來已久、然其大陸政策、一方固在攫得滿蒙、一方則爲對全世界而發、其中捭闔張翕、各有其立塲、各有其論調、一鱗半爪、固已散見於各書、茲得關係方面有系統之立論、特爲整理發表、讀者於此、庶可思得其半乎、</p>
<p>原夫日本以三島立國、固明知其人口繁殖之不能容納、物產資源之不足自給、因而有拓殖之計劃也、然日本以軍備立國、尤知三島懸於海洋、四面腹背可以受敵、故隨時不能不爲四面應戰之準備、夫戰爭所必備之條件、海陸軍以外、尤重在戰備品之供給、糧食之資濟、日本蕞爾之區、力不能堪、亦盡知之、不能自給、則圖取於域外、理所必然、故日本之積極行其大陸政策、與其僅謂之殖、不如逕謂之世界大戰之準備可也、</p>
<p>以言大戰之準備、其最要者、厥爲國防綫問題及戰鬥計畫、日本以日逼處此、知必不能倖免於戰爭、尤知世界大勢所推遷、有聨合攻擊之危險、故其所擬之計畫、必從四面準備、正如歐洲大戰時代德國、以獨力敵聨軍、夫以獨力敵聨軍、亦人人知其不易、况日本以島國孤懸海洋、倘　以此一隅之地、抵抗四面海陸空之襲擊、不且瞬成焦士乎、故日人計費軍事、必且併中國計畫在內、蓋在其戰時之布置、除求得大量之資源原料於東三省外、更且犧牲中國爲其戰塲也、</p>
<p>由以獨力敵聨軍之立場言之美自東來、日自必於海上抗之、且利用太平洋中之島嶼可以爲根據地者、資爲立足之基礎然英自兩洋來、新加坡旣有軍港、香港又爲其屬地、日又必在中國兩部之海洋中與之爭持、然而英人之勢力厚、且勢力及於揚子江流域、正是未易爲敵、故對英之戰策、勢必令其深入而襲擊之、使脫離其日常之勢力範圍、容易邀擊、其地點之最適當者、莫若淮河黃河間之大平原、此其以中國板圖爲戰塲之策略一也、</p>
<p>東三省之資源、爲日人所埀涎者旣久、且必需資爲戰時原料糧秣者、前已言之矣、然日人之於東三省、不特爲資源已也、且欲確定東省爲其國防線、蓋聨軍之說、果不幸而成爲事實、作國豈有不加入之理、北撫其背、旣攫其資源之寶藏、又且慮進取朝鮮、危險及於本部故、其對東三省之注意國防、容有勝於資源者、且近年以來、大興安嶺免渡河次、在森林之中、業巳完成其防禦公式、牧馬設防、巳非一日、札免公司之森林區域、年年損失、參謀本部、乃出秘密費以爲之維持、年耗數百萬元、即於此叢林蔽天之內、加以設備、又以便衣軍隊、布置其間、凡有外人前往者、輒假名馬賊以殺之、故無論何人、不能窺其底蘊、蓋一國家之國防綫及國防設備、乃置之於鄰國、而且不爲鄰國所知、則日本之軍計劃、亦眞可謂極神秘之能事矣、在九一八發難之前、有所謂中村被殺事件者、中村即奉派至興安嶺調查、中途被殺、日人以爲口實、有所來也、</p>
<p>夫日人之國策旣定、則一切一切、亦均乘此國策以行之、舉凡政治外交、固無不循茲途徑而進行者也、明乎日人之國策、始能言中國之應付、中國固無國策可言、然即此臨時之外交方針、不當知彼知已而後决定耶、顧我國負外交責任者、於對日本進行之線路以及對國際間之立塲、三思可矣、（承）</p>

<h3>如何有福同享</h3>
<p>有禍同當、答、就是加了工資則有福同享、绱加不到而停生意、則當然要有禍同當、至此問告訴人等、對於前請王培源律師、現在一致的與王律師解除委任、另請別律師矣、故王律師當卽退庭、至此、傳被害人家屬、馬嘉慶供、年六十九歲、如　人、住新小東門十二號做銅匠、死者馬扣賣是我幼予、馬陳氏是我兒媳、馬陳氏供年二十八歲、要求辦被告抵命、</p>
<h3>並損害三萬元</h3>
<p>當延律師郭衛·李銘·余祥琴·等說明全家七口、共作八七十年計算、每年最少三百元、需洋二萬六千一百元、又老者喪葬、幼者敎育、共計三千九百元、總計三萬元、依刑訴法五零六條、及海商法二十三條一欵規定、判裕興輪船公司與被告等連帶賠償、被告共九十三人、不到案者亦要賠償、而在輪船作事、先欲保證金的、可問輪船公司提取等語、裕興公司代理律師邊守一起稱、原告對裕興公司者、或用民法一百八十八條、或用海商法二十三條、然文中須受偏人因執行職務不法侵害他人之權利爲限、言之受僱人無非因執行職務之行爲、縱不法侵害他人之權利、</p>
<h3>與雇用人無涉</h3>
<p>本案孫杏生等殺人嫌疑、縱屬實在、亦係個人行爲、此非因執行職務必定要殺人、故與公司絲毫無關、至此、官問梅尤氏供、年二十六歲、死者梅老二是我丈夫、要求損害一萬五千三百五十六元、並由唐豪律師說明一家四口、計算三十四年、每年一百四十四元、及喪葬敎育等費、並云死者因不買票而被殺的、其請求如馬陳氏之理由、而過守一律師復如上之辯駁、訊至此、已中午、故諭下午一時半繼續審理、下午訊據周馬氏供、年三十歲平湖人、住小東門、丈夫周大通係湖北人、在年三十二歲、問你夫做何事的、答在新仁和輪船上賣水菓的、我家有一母及一男一女、我夫生前每月可賺六十餘元、一家靠其過活、現在要被告賠償洋一萬五千元、並延張淸樾律師代爲陳述、每月四十元生活費、計二十年、計洋九千六百元、又周母名下、計十元一月、以十年一千二百元、殯葬費二百元、又敎育費婚嫁費四千元、共計一萬五千元、裕興公司當然要負　、蓋其所簽合同、均是輪船上執行職務者、而王冠仙且係代表公司的對於不法所爲、其是</p>
<h3>主張最烈的人</h3>
<p>被害人與被告均無仇隙、茍非因業務上必須之需、斷不致殺害、並且看卷中、卽不買票而發生慘劇、是爲執行職務殊明、而彼告又稱係海盜、故發生緊急處分、則照海商法看來、當然又爲執行職務、被告等爲忠于公司職務、發生不法行爲、要公司負擔點、天良上亦說得過去、被害人家屬而僅僅要求賠償、與道德上亦說得過、至此過守一律師復爲公司簽、辯王冠仙是掛名協理、他往靈甸港、這回養病來滬、他是個人的事、與公司無涉、這對於買票的事、宛如說販賣毒物、無非假定人罪、均非執行職務、至此官問魏朱氏、係瞎子、供年三十六歲、住新小東門十二號、死者魏金福、是我夫侄、我們未分過家、我靠他過活的、要求判償損害一萬九千八百元、當延朱紹文律師代陳、以五十元一月計算三十三年、連其姑一併在內、依民法一百八十八條第一項、在執行職務的時候、不應侵害他人譬如除劊子手他是專殺人的、其他執行職務者、當無專爲因執行職務而殺人的本、案卽利用職務的機會來殺人、故應由公司連帶負擔、至此過守一律師又代公司答辯、對、於民法百八十八條、倘如上述之解釋執行職務、應請立法者加上一個中字、方可說執行職務中而侵、害現在有一比較、茍一個東家雇一個用人、到小菜塲去買菜、</p>
<h3>在路上殺了人</h3>
<p>是否有東家在內、他亦是執行職務、故不能如此解釋至劊子手者卽刑法上依法令爲不罰者、而輪船之執行職務卽將他人之船撞沉損壞的解釋也、至此問孫周氏供、年四十七歲、死者孫信亮是我丈夫、寫沈信亮是寫錯的、是淸江人家有七十二歲老母、八十四歲婆婆十六歲女三歲男、要求一萬六千二百元、並由宋律師聲明以五十元一月計、連殯葬敎育費在內、所有原因、對公司者已詳魏朱氏陳述中、又經過守一律師陳述、亦如前語、至此、又經唐豪律師聲明、有三具屍體、在靈甸港撈獲、現由海門縣收殮、是否死者、請提移到案、官命自向該縣騐視、至此被告王墨淸辯護律師張同慶稱、現王墨淸在看守所</p>
<h3>寫信與孫杏生</h3>
<p>有孫復信、證明王無關、（其信略稱　前弟毫無参加、你們開會亦所不知、如閣下（指孫杏生命我簽的、）官乃問王墨淸聲稱接、到起訴書後我請人寫與孫杏生、他有回信、來（略云、吃點苦、聽天由命、）官乃問孫杏生、答我不識字、如果寫信把他、犯我雷殛、我亦沒有收到他信等語、至此施慶華律師起稱、本案爲希有之巨案、故貴審判長不厭求、詳已審訊三日但王墨淸這種去信回信、多在一個看守所中弄出來的、慮嚴加鞫訊、非特可以瞭然案情、且亦免得無辜寃獄云云、官乃問王墨淸答、信不是我寫的、我請人寫的、船主來喊我簽字、問是弄死人的那日嗎、答日子忘記了、大約十時光景至此、陸家　律師起稱、本案爲上海第一件大案、對於量刑的輕重殊爲重要、而起訴書上有因竊盜王三郎銀錢而起但未曾傳過、手續似嫌欠缺、倘玉石不分、於道德良心上殊爲不安、如傳王三郎、可貴成公司去傳、因王係崇明人、可以查傳、至此、官問孫杏生這紙頣何人寫的、答陳葆生交我簽字的、不知何人寫的至此、問官</p>
<h3>宣告開始辯論</h3>
<p>請張梓檢察官論告意見、張檢察官起謂本案分三點、一·孫杏生·郭鍚候·陸永慶·王墨淸·朱顧林·陳葆生·王冠仙·等敎唆殺人、這種犯罪事實、在水巡隊供、王冠仙向他商量、要將四人拋在江中、將人捆起而拋、並云五個人本欲送官究辦、因一人落水身死、沒有辦法、乃在船上開會、命馮興發·沈川郎·沈星喬·王明大·劉永慶·黃福生·張同才·王壽明·小王麻子·等、繫石拋在江中、第二點馮興發等實施殺人、且有證人顧積菴之指證、王明大搬石頭、及死者在三台甲上是又適用預謀殺人、第三點王杏江等一干人、固謀殺人、這一部分人、最要緊因孫杏生等沒有法予、乃設計滅口、當初在水巡隊內、已經先後供明、不過顧於這一層、內中不免有</p>
<h3>被動及畏禍者</h3>
<p>此一部分請酌量處刑云云、至此、孫杏生之辯護律師章士剑辯論、此案各被害人爲海盜積竊、竊人之物、尙欲殺人、致羣衆發生公債、而一時激於義憤、所謂怒從心頭起、惡向胆邊生、非處心積慮之預謀、在輪船上這種如無政府狀况、無法律裁制時、自衛之道、在中國古律殺盜無罪、卽文明國自衛亦免訴、的縱馬扣賣等家屬困難、但死者將每日得一斗五升之小商人中爲害人家、更非常痛苦、雖則被告有侵害國家權利之嫌疑、然要斟酌其性因此孫一唱百和、羣衆的恩　上、早巳變態、了所以我們研究心理學中將羣衆中一人而分開了則昏昏沉沉、將前事嚇昏了、故文明國家、對於羣衆地方另治一種刑法的、而被告等</p>
<h3>又均非現行犯</h3>
<p>旅客多走了、如果謀死、這五個人旅客中、、豈有不與此五人有同情心者、倘搭客之事、而責任不能完全在船員處也、而刑事採直接主義、水巡隊供詞不足爲根據云云、又蔡倪培律師辯論、檢察官改刑法爲二百八十四條預謀殺人、及起訴書二百八十五條爲免犯罪處罰但預謀一層、倘他們不搶東西卽能以預謀殺他們耶、故法律須斟酌原來、本案有搭客王三郎夫婦在海洪港搭小船、到海門川洪港去、乃竊賊於客人上下船時爲竊盜、當竊取王三郎銀洋爲其爲所見、呼喊而賊已將贓移交同黨、反一拳將王門牙打去兩只、其妻帮助、又傷一目、這種對於量刑輕重、多有關係、被害人之盜匪行爲、</p>
<h3>足以激動公憤</h3>
<p>何得謂預謀、請傳王夫婦到案、以免失實、此係有數十家商舖蓋章、到啓崇海同鄕會報告的、明日當帶來、而合同上尙有陳富貴一名、他早於二月裏停歇、則何以三月裏還簽字、足見非殺人之字據、故請從寬免刑、至此已下午六時、官諭翌日再行辯論、</p>

<h3>愛情的保證復杭州蘇林女士來信</h3>
<p>答：女士手敎，讀誦再三，惘然之情，不能自已！一來是女士對於夫婦之義，纒綿悱惻，情見乎詞。歏國風之未沬，詠小雅而傷懐。二來是記者半生書劍，未入情塲，辱承明問，何異問道於盲？邇來國勢陵夷，瘡痍滿目，大仇在眼，義憤塡膺，兒女繾綣之私，更不知從何說起！此非矯情之論，實係肺腑之言。女士必欲於盡眉金屋之時，低訴羅幃之際，使郎君知女士入微之愛，正如彼之愛君，此種愛情三味，亦只能在實踐中去探索，猶之人之學游泳也，要在游泳中去學，未可徒於言語文字中求之也。惟女士下述一問：「我們女子在小家庭地位究竟應該負何種責任或職務？「，有可得而言者。現在女子巳由男子玩具時代解放出來；男子而果爲社會，爲國家，爲人羣服務，不營營於一身一家則女子在其相其夫或助之服務社會，亦非僅爲一人一家之私，如娜德在逹，君斯旦古娜芙娜NadeschdoKonstantinoruna之列寗，燕娓之於馬克思有是稱者。若然則無施而不可，在家在外，大而社會國家，小而白米紅鹽，其事一也。至於言情之書，頑鈍如愚，平生殆少誦習，無巳則以歐洲二百年名人情書與現代情書二者（均上海亞東圖書館出版）對！惟列氏有言：「靑年們，特別需要生活的快樂與力量。健康的游戲，游泳，賽跑，竸走，各種體操，和多方面的知識的興趣。讀者，研究，考察，以至於盡可能的普遍。這要比那對於性的問題以及所謂「生活的充實Liuingtotbefull）的萬世不易的理論和討論所給與靑年們的要多些。健康的身體，健康的精神！「（列寗回憶錄之八二頁。上海正午書局）。由此看來，女士的丈夫能以醫學上的知識保護女士的健康，確是非常可寶貴的事：以女士之文采若能以俠骨柔腸鼓勵他擴充兩人夫婦之愛以愛社會愛國·外抗强敵，內鋤巨㚥，使「內無怨女，外無曠夫，」勝兩人閨中之愛萬萬矣！女士以爲何如？</p>

<h3>修改與製造</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>比方一件衣衫，我們穿得不稱身了，就可以修改或重做一件新的。比方一雙鞋子，我們穿得不合適了，也可以修改或重做一雙新的。對於我們不合適的東西，我們有權可改造得合適或另造合適的。</p>
<p>不過修改不如創新。要把舊有的修改得好，是很不容易的事，而且改得能否合適，也不會有十分把握，　不如重新製造，可以稱心如意，衣衫還是做件新的，鞋子也還是做雙新的好。</p>
<p>從前有個琴師招收徒弟，對巳經學習過琴的比從未學過的要收加倍的學費，因爲要矯正壞的習癖，費力比敎生手更大，也就是修改不如新造的道理據聞中央已派大員指導全國輿論了，人想這便是很費力而難見功的事。究竟指導只不過是指導而不是製造，和修改衣衫鞋子有點相類，不是徹底的辦法。倘使覺得輿論不合適，不是可以製造出一種合適的來嗎？派員指導不如在內政敎育等部添設一個司理輿論的專科，因爲可以指導的地方，一定可以製造的，而製造出來的要更加合適也毫無疑問。</p>
<p>但衣裳和鞋子的所以不合適，也有種種道理。或是因爲身體突然發育起來，長了大了，衣衫便難稱身，也有因爲肩背上長了個肉瘤，脚踝上生了個大瘡，那麼衣衫應當在肩頭開個洞穴，鞋子只好改用拖鞋了。不過一味想在衣衫上開洞，想穿拖鞋，而不想到把瘡治療，把肉瘤割去的，恐怕未必是賢明的辦法罷。</p>
<p>因此想到指導輿論固然是狠難收效的事，而更進一步的製造輿論，也未必高明。倘使肩背上長着肉瘤的，不把衣衫在肩口開洞仍是不行，但開了洞的衣衫也不見得什麼體面了，根本何以不把肉瘤割去呢？希望得到歌功頌德的輿論的，請先做出一些値得歌頌的事來。像宋財長在美國借到了棉麥，不是已經得到上海紗廠主粉廠主的歌頌了嗎？况且輿論並不是限定在報章雜誌上登載的文章。</p>
<h3>曇的天</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>曇的天，一切都是陰曇的，連我的心也是陰曇的。</p>
<p>我獨自在曇的天曇的空氣裏走着。一些人從我身旁擦過去了，靜靜地，在我的後邊落下他們的笑聲。他們的生活是愉快的。</p>
<p>人們都在做着生活的夢。壯年人夢着過去，靑年人夢着未來。而我却在這現實的曇的天曇的空氣裏走着。</p>
<p>抬頭向上望，上面是個銀灰色的曇的天。濕霧蒙在屋角，烟似的。一些旗幟在風中獵獵在翻動，發着輕微的凄楚的聲響。我茫然漠然的走着。在人羣中，我是狐獨的，我並且有一顆狐獨的曇的心。一個賣報孩子站在我面前：菜色的臉·黑色的眼珠，眼珠裏放着期待的光。這臉，這眼珠，都是陰曇的。「大晚報，大美晚報······」</p>
<p>我沒的看報的興趣，我更沒有買報的心思，我的心已由緊張而鬆弛了。而且，這報紙它又能告訴我些什麼呢？我能從這裏面看到一串巧妙的辭句掩飾着一個醜惡的眞象，却不能從這裏面找到一個失蹤朋友的消息！我搖搖頭。他失望地走了。</p>
<p>曇的天，仍舊覆蓋在我頭上。一切都從我身旁過去；紳士，淑女，影戲院，咖啡座，呂宋烟的香味，Jazz音樂的聲音。</p>
<p>迎面走來了一對白俄男女，污舊的服裝，泥濘的皮鞋，憔悴的臉，嘴角上浮着一些苦笑。這些笑，我好像在那兒見過似的。</p>
<p>記起來了，那是在一個月前，我因事到無錫去。也是這麼樣的一個曇的天。在農村裏，我遇見了一對農家夫婦，坐在他們自已茅屋前的一條板凳上，絮絮的談着他們生活的苦况。那男的吸着烟，被烟霚蒙着的臉也是陰曇的，一絲苦笑掛在他的嘴角上。就是這樣的一種苦笑，我記得很淸楚。</p>
<p>我的心，微微地感覺痛楚起來了。這世界上，有着各種苦痛的生活。不論是有祖國的人無祖國的人，都同樣的在這苦痛的生活中掙扎着，然而他們的身體仍舊不住的沉落下去。他們的生命是生存在生命圈邊的。</p>
<p>我茫然漠然的走着。曇的天，覆蓋在我的頭上。曇的心，跳躍在我的胸中。我又循着原路走了回來。</p>
<p>「大晚報······」那賣報孩子第二次出現在我眼前。菜色的臉，黑色的眼珠，眼珠裏放着期待的光。他手裏的報紙只剩下一張了。</p>
<p>我不自覺的把這僅有的一張報紙接了過來。雖然我仍沒有看報的興趣，更沒有買報的心思，然而我終於在身邊取出了錢。</p>
<p>當他伸出手來接錢的時候，我順便把他的手握了一握。手，是冰冷的。冷氣直竄進我的血管，變襲進我的心房，使我的心整個兒的冰結了起來。</p>
<p>「可憐的孩子！」我不由得低低的說了這麼一句。</p>
<p>曇的天，一切都是陰曇的。我希望這曇的天快一些的過去。</p>
<h3>機會</h3>
<p>— 伍</p>
<p>當門房的蔣四爺和看門巡捕都嘻着笑臉笑我，說小姐看上我了，她呌我天天開着車不知兩人上什麼地方去。我雖然口裏不肯承認，心中却有些暗喜。這事情并不是沒來由的，譬如前天在東方罷，小姐的心到底怎樣，我雖沒有把握，但也許是我自已太笨拙了一點不知道見機行事，也說不定的。那實在是一個絕好機會。我正在想着那天在東方的事，裏面又傳出話來了，小姐吩咐預備車，她要出去。我想，難道東方飯店的機會又來了嗎？那麼今天一定得抓住這機會，別讓牠逃走了。那天小姐呌我同進去，開了一個房間淴浴，浴後就短衣赤足，呌我倒了乂乂露（是什麼露呀？）送到沙發跟前去，隨後又呌克坐下。···坐下，我的天，我怎麼竟會那麼傻？她身邊不敢坐，竟那麼老遠老遠的退到對面去。···</p>
<p>但那是我太沒有經騐的緣故。對於女人，我眞是太不熟習了。以後我得胆大一點。譬如，今天，······</p>
<p>今天小姐是穿着一件淡綠色起花的華絲沙旗袍，下垂及地，走起來，遠遠的飄飄而起。一出來就問··「阿倪，車好了沒？」那聲音就好像銀鈴似的。</p>
<p>我把車廂門打開，讓她上去，但她却一步踏進前面開車的地方，就坐在我開車的座位，葱一般的手指，齊齊的擺在轉輪上。這可怎麼辦呢？我，怎麼辦呢？······蔣四爺在旁邊以乎看出我爲難，催我道，「上去啊，小姐自己會得開車的。」我覺得我有些頭腦發脹，我不知道我要如何坐，在前面一道和小姐并肩坐着呢？坐在後廂讓小姐給我開車？我的左脚在車沿上踏了兩下，有些錯亂抖顫起來。</p>
<p>從後面伸出一條手掌，把我推進車來，車門也隨後砰然關上了。我昏惘得很。機聲把我震動了幾下，身體不覺向後一傾，車已經在開動了。我的肩和另一個肩磨碰着。</p>
<p>我定了一定神發現我和小姐是并肩坐着，小姐白玉一般的手指在轉輪上不住的跳動，上面點綴着一兩顆金光燦爛嵌着寶石的戒指在十字街口停息的時候，我感到濃厚的香風，在週圍薰襲。我不知道我今天會遭遇到什麼樣的事，使我驚喜不定。在路上，我偷看了小姐幾眼，她只顧兩眼直視，全神貫注在開車。她駕車的技術并不壞，雖然走起來有些歪歪斜斜，轉折不能十分靈敏。</p>
<p>經過幾條馬路我沒有當心，但到了前天的老地方，東方銀店。一般無二，車子也正在前天停車的地方停下來。她笑了一笑，撥開那邊的車門下去了，我，怎麼辦呢？胆大點，也下去跟着她，走上電梯，一直到六樓我就好像做夢似的。情形和那天一般無二：茶房開了房門，我們一同進去。她倒在沙發上道：「我乏了」現在，我應當怎麼辦呢？機會是來了。</p>
<p>然而她說：「阿倪，呌茶房呌兩客點心來。」她準備和我共食了哩。我心裏像一團火要從胸口衝出來。我歡喜，但不知道怎麼辦？我照樣去吩咐了茶房。</p>
<p>小姐一面卸裝，一面說，「我先淴浴，點心來了呌等一等。」</p>
<p>是的，等一等。不到一刻鐘，她已經到後面浴室裏去了。我坐着，不知道我應當如何想。今天，······</p>
<p>於是，我想，淴浴以後，她是短衣赤足的走進來，我立刻倒了茶或其他什麼走向她，於是，伸開手去抱着。···我想得有些頭暈，胸口怦怦的發跳。而房門響了，我的心跳得更加利害。我顫抖着兩腿，旋開房門，却是一個西裝少年。他點點頭，一直進來，在沙發上坐下，一點也不謙遜。這使我有些發惱。但我想，他也許是走錯了，他看錯號頭了罷，於是，我走了去問他道：</p>
<p>「您找誰？」</p>
<p>「周小姐。」他抬起頭來。然而我們的小姐并不姓周，我知道他一定錯了。</p>
<p>「這裏沒有姓周的。這房間是五O八號」「沒有？五O八號，是啊，五O八。」他忙翻出日記冊來查看。他似乎沒有翻着，有些慌急·。我正在他身旁等機會好把他攆走，小姐却從浴室裏出來了。</p>
<p>「噢，來了？」她看見那男人滿臉堆下笑來。那男人忙轉身大笑：</p>
<p>「五O八，我說是五O八啊，這位朋友說這裏沒有姓周的，這不是周小姐是誰？」我開口想爭辯，因爲小姐并不姓周。我知道的。但小姐阻住我向那男人道：「得了罷，別問人姓周姓李。」她又向我揮揮手：「你先開車回去，回頭我打電話來呌你」</p>
<p>我走出電梯，像作了一個惡夢。我吐了一口唾沫，忖道：我幹了什麼？蔣；四爺却嘻着臉在笑我。······</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— JulesRenara作林取譯</p>
<p>打獵的時候（續）</p>
<p>因那新成績而得意洋洋，他質直地陳述着他的方法。「你是認眞地在說着嗎？」雷辟克說。紅蘿蔔鬚|那還用說！我自然不會誇口說我每次都不會　。雷辟克|給我馬上閉住你的鳥嘴罷，蠢東西。你如果想人家繼續說你是個聰明孩子的話，我勸你不要在別人面前說出這樣蠢話罷。人家會當面笑你的。如果你這是偶然和你父親開頑笑的話，那自然不要緊。紅蘿蔔鬚|不是的爸爸，我可以同你發誓。可是你說得有理，請你原諒，我不過是一個蠢才罷了。蒼蠅</p>
<p>打獵的事繼續着，紅蘿蔔鬚懐着悔恨的心思聳聳肩，他旣覺得自已非常愚蠢，他便以一種新的熱情跟着他的父親前進，他一心一意地便得他的左脚恰恰踏在雷辟克的左脚所踏過的地方，他舉步如飛，像在逃避一個吃血鬼似的。除非偶然　摘一枚桑子，一隻野梨，或幾顆野季，才稍爲停一停脚，這些東西都是酸口的，都使得嘴唇變成白色，但却都可以止渴。其實除此外，他那獵獲袋的一格裏面還帶着一瓶燒酒（ean-vie）。一口又一口地，差不多給他一個人喝光了，因爲雷辟克把全心傾注在打獵一事上面，竟忘記問他要了「喝一點兒嗎，爸爸？」</p>
<p>風送來的是一個拒絕的回答。紅蘿蔔鬚把斟給他父親喝的一點兒酒一口喝光了，把瓶子全喝空了，頭腦昏昏的，又趕上去跟在他父親後面。突然，他停住了，把一個指頭塞在他的耳朶裏面，很厲害地鬧着，然後抽出來，裝作聽的樣子，他對雷辟克呌道：「你曉得嗎，爸爸，我覺得有一隻蒼蠅飛到我的耳朶裏面去了。」雷辟克|把她拿出來好啦。紅蘿蔔鬚|她已經進去很深了，我的指頭碰她不到。我聽見她在耳朶裏面嗡嗡的呌着。雷辟克|讓她自已死在那裏面罷。紅蘿蔔鬚|如果她在裏面下卵呢，爸爸，如果她在裏面造窩呢？雷辟克|想法子用一條手帕角把她弄死罷紅蘿蔔鬚|我倒一點燒酒在耳朶裏面把她溺死怎樣？你許可我嗎？「隨你的意思去倒好了，」雷辟克對他呌說，「但你快點啦。」紅蘿蔔鬚把酒瓶湊在耳朶上，他又把她倒了一次，這是爲着防備雷辟克想追問他那份的。於是，一會兒紅蘿蔔鬚便很愉快的，一路跑着，一面呌道：「你曉得嗎，爸爸，我已經聽不到蒼蠅了。她大約已經死了。不過她把酒通通喝去了。」</p>

<h3>延年促壽</h3>
<p>— 瞻慮</p>
<p>老頭兒眞不中抬舉，大阪神戶沿線魚崎鄕，有一百九十三人的尙齒會，參預一種引年的盛宴，老頭兒大開五臟殿，自已吃飽了不算數，還要把食品携歸鄕里，分配家族近鄰，以便人人都做了壽頭。誰料，結果適得其反，受食者完全吐瀉，他們的五臟殿褒，竟誤進了一批毒貨，以致，死亡相繼，哭聲震天！以延年始，以促壽終，老頭兒起勁不得，一起勁便鑄成了大錯。</p>
<p>本來，延年和促壽是相反的，有時也是相因的；大唐時代，朝野迷信金丹，以爲，服了可以長生不老；誰料，服金丹的十之八九都中了金丹毒，往往因此致命，促其天年，這不是以延年始，以促壽終麼，不過，爲了服金丹而促壽，這是本人自取其咎，魚崎鄕的老人中毒，咎不在老人，而在「聽松亭」菜店製菜不愼，以致誤傷了許多人命；倘怪老頭兒過於起勁，似乎苛責了老人。</p>
<p>子細想來，聽松亭固然要負重大的責任，但，老頭兒不好說完全是旡妄之災。我便想起孔二先生的話了，他說：「及其老也，血氣旣衰，戒之在得。」得是貪得的意思，範圍是很大的；貪色是得，貪財也是得，貪名也是得，貪神仙也是得，貪飮食也是得。魚崎鄕的老人，爲什麼不躱在家裏，擁著黃臉婆子戲弄幼孫作樂，却要氣吁吁地去參預這尙齒會呢？剖析他們的心理，不是貪虛名，定是貪飮食；有許多議員列席陪飮，何等榮耀？這便是貪虛名。有聽松亭的名庖製菜以快朶頤，這便是貪飮食。爲着犯了「戒之在得」的訓條，以致不保這條老命，尙齒會變做沒齒會，魚崎鄕老人都成了吞餌之魚，唉！貪之爲害蓋如此。</p>
<h3>泥馬渡康王之遺蹟</h3>
<p>— 俞友淸</p>
<p>我邑（常熟）僻居海隅，負虞山之勝，遠地遊客，春秋佳日，聨袂而來，康南海于騷心輩，常樂而忘倦，筆之於詩，文友范烟　君，比虞山如六朝人之小品，而程小靑君，以劍門之雄，拂水之曠。，爲最足使人留戀不捨者。余輯虞山之誌，以餉來遊者，作一嚮導，曾踏遍虞山，探勝尋古，搜集資料，對於附近各地，亦加以注意。在虞城之東，相距約四十二里許，地名滸浦，俗名彭家橋，我邑臨江之重鎭也。每至洋汛時，異常熱鬧，爲海鮮進口總匯之地，邑中人欲食鮮魚，如刀魚黃魚蚌魚等，須至該地，可以一嘗佳味，携之城中，已失其味矣。在滸浦附近三四里許，有一問村，據土人云：宋時康王南渡，曾在該地登陸，村甚小，祇有村舍十餘家，迄今亦不滿百家。村本無名，後因康王所問，遂以問村呼之，今則該在人士，易問爲文，顧名思義，相去遠矣。有馬代墩，云係康王之泥馬所化，上建高閣，閣亦無名，在猛將堂之後，廟內附有小學，絃歌之聲，時聞戶外，廟內有鐵梗海棠一株，花色如丹，累累若珠，可貴也。街北有馬跡橋，云有康王泥馬之足跡，實則泥馬代墩，已成爲神話，而泥馬能留跡於石橋之上，更是齊東野人之語，不足爲信。後之人，爲紀念康王，特留遺跡，以供後來者之憑弔興慨，不忘偏安之高宗也，一如蘇州靈　山之琴台，亦有西施之足印，其意相同，無足奇矣。余偶憶此事，添余不少感喟，康王南渡，受異族之侵略，其後雖能暫支偏安之局，終爲元人所滅，今日之中國，華北方面雖已和平簽字，暫告無恙，此後時局之變遷，正在難以捉摸之中，言念及此。爲之擲筆一哭。</p>

<p>— 白雪</p>
<p>端陽巳過了。農村正是忙碌的時候了。</p>
<p>小麥黃橙橙的發光，已經熟老了；但還沒有熟透，尙未樵割。前村的林子裏，三兩隻候鳥在唱着布穀歌，牠們的歌聲好像：「快快布穀秋收秋熟快快布穀快樂快樂」但這時有個村童騎在年背上，走過瓜田旁邊，他聽到了布穀鳥的歌聲，却嚷喊着：</p>
<p>『澆澆瓜科嫂嫂放火···」瓜田裏的瓜科才只有四瓣嫩葉子，像一科小卉似的。</p>
<p>蠶早的人家，已經挑了繭子到鎭上去賣了，各處繭行已經絡續開秤。桑田裏却還有一羣男女在採靑葉，在調笑着。</p>
<p>『四月的桑林高又高，小妹妹的眼睛朝我瞟，我忙將小妹妹來抱，小妹妹對我微······』一個壯健的靑年唱到這裏，已經把一個姑娘擁在懐裏了。那姑娘笑嘻嘻的掙扎着，其餘的人都拍手笑着。终於被Kiss着了。接着是旁觀者的一陣閧笑。田埂邊的農夫在挖掘灰塘，這是準備儲放草泥猪污等肥料的。現在，農人都在忙着勞動，爲他們·的生活而奮鬥。</p>
<h3>談夫婦分床制</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>近来有几位學者們，爲講究『性的衛生』起見，特提倡『夫婦分床制。』在晨報附刋『婦女與家庭』欄·時常有這種論文發表。這固然持之有故，言之成理。不料因此引起那位摩登老人徐卓呆先生的反對；他說：『一個男子，或一個女子，獨自睡在一隻床上，必定有一種特殊的氣味。！但說也奇怪，如果男女同睡一床，這兩種氣味，竟會同時消滅。大約起了化學作用，互相抵消了。可見男女同睡一床，乃自然之配合。』云云：他反對的理由，眞是又幽默，又簡單。但是依在下看來，大可打句官話，『此事應無庸議。』因爲這『夫婦分床制，』在現代繁囂的都巿裏，實在有些『窒碍難行。』</p>
<p>你想上海是『寸金地，』是『人烟稠密』的地方。在此房租日漲，居戶擁擠，普通都是『鴿籠式』的小家庭。盛行『亭子間嫂嫂，『』攔樓上先生，』『後樓嬸嬸，『』灶披間好婆，』的富兒；眞是『室小如斗，居纔容膝。』正所謂『寢於斯，食於斯，聚骨肉於斯，大小便於斯。』還有什麼有餘的地位，供你廻旋，供你分床。所以大都是『夫婦同床：』有的，不但夫婦同床，還要帶着許多『結晶品，』如</p>
<p>阿大阿二阿三之流，睏在一起。熱鬧之狀，簡直像『趁航船』一樣。有的，上了年紀的老夫婦，也還效駌鴦之同衾。也有的，　一妻一妾的齊人，同作大被之包容，亦所在多有。這都是爲着『經嚌』和『地盤』的關係，不得不把『睡的問題，『緊縮起來。甚至『疊床架屋，』還嫌容積太小。照此情形，這分床制，除了『有錢階級』的大家庭，可以從容實行外，根本是難以辦到。現在在下有個折衷辦法，不得己而思其次，就是改爲『分被制。』同床各被，實行『同床各夢』這句話。楚漢爲界，各守盟約，兩不相侵，未嘗不可减少『性的衝動。』這樣一來，旣不妨碍『性的衛生，』又適合於『兩性間氣味的調和。』，豈非是兼籌並顧，輕而易舉的事嗎</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第九回謔語豈無由東床暗引突來良有以西席閑籌桂枝這才知道母親昨夜是假睡着深自慶幸不曾向曼英答應一個字出來。至於曼英呢，冷眼看這娘兒倆的態度，都覺的楊趙兩家，大有結合的可能。當日在楊家坐談了半上午，後面的趙翁，帶着聽差小林回來了。江氏聽了趙翁的聲音，先就到後院子裏來報信，他站在院子裏先就呌了一聲老太爺。趙翁迎出屋來拱着手道：昨晚上多蒙您照應。江氏道：照應什麼，昨晚上來了一位客我娘兒倆忙着招待，把照應後院的事，差不多都忘了。您說是誰？江氏說着，就走近身兩步，低聲道；就是認得田連長的黃小姐來了。趙翁摸着鬍子哦了一聲。繼而微笑道：年輕的人，總是性子急，昨天我要知道黃小姐會來，我就不該進城去了。請您招待他坐一會兒，我攏上了火，燒好了水，就請他過來。江氏回去了，趙翁却大爲起勁，自已帮着小林攏火燒水，收拾屋子。這兒還沒有歸理淸楚，院子裏就有人呌着道；老太爺回來啦？趙翁隔子玻璃窗，向外張望着，見一個女学生樣子的人，夾了一捲包袱，走將進來，就親自來開了風門，讓着曼英進來，笑着連連拱手，兩拳抱着，高舉過鼻，笑道：您就是黃小姐了。這樣的冷天，老遠的要你跑了來，眞是過意不去。趙翁雖然年邁，說話的聲音，却是非常之高朗。曼英進門之後，搶着鞠了一個躬，連忙的向趙翁搖了兩搖手，笑着低聲道；您別嚷，您別嚷，我到這兒來的意思，他們一點也不知道。趙翁笑着點了幾點頭，支着手，請曼英在火爐邊的椅子上坐下。趙翁坐在對面椅子上，又摸了鬍子，只管出神。黃曼英低聲道；老太爺，恭喜您，這一杯喜酒，我算是喝成了。趙翁微笑道；老太太的意思，我是知道，他沒有什麼可說的，這就瞧姑娘的意思。曼英笑道；這個何消老太爺說，我自然是知道的。我的意思，也就是去探探這位姑娘的意見這麼樣？據他昨晚和我說的話，他並沒有什麼可以反對的。（一O一）</p>
<h3>回力球塲素描（下）</h3>
<p>— 奚茶</p>
<p>在比賽的時候，全塲鴉雀無聲，大家屏息凝神的看着，只聽得球彈在壁上聲，和籐兜　球聲，劈拍不絕，到了勝負旣分，拍掌聲和「噓！」「噓！」聲同時並作，每個人面部表情，各各不同，喜·怒·哀·樂，各式都有，而議論也紛紛而起。</p>
<p>「上一盤歐蘭加排三號，連打五分，打得非常起勁，我看准他要出「三」「二」雙獨贏，你看！他現在打到三分了，再打兩分，我的一百十六元八角，便可穏穏到手！」一個着西装的小鬍子，得意揚揚，自誇眼力不錯。</p>
<p>「畢爾保昨天只出了一雙位置，我以爲他今天總要熱一點，那知他今天還是這樣瘟，眞倒霉！」一位摩登女郎自怨自艾地告訴伊的同伴。「我勸你買五號，你却定要買一號，你看！現在一號一分都沒有，還有什麼希望！」一個婦人埋怨一個男子，看光景，那男子是伊的丈夫。「二號决不會再連打五分，說不定六號獨贏，二號位置。」一位着印度綢長衫的大塊頭，手中握着三張六號獨贏票，所以他的希望如是「··················」「··················」大家正在議論紛紜，下一號的球員，又出來打了，於是重復平靜下去。這樣忽擾忽靜，直到某號球員已得到五分，裁判員銀笛一吹，記分板上便懸出某號W，（獨贏的記號）某號P，（位置的記號）這時一部分電燈又恢復了光明，音樂和鈴聲也重復響了起來，於是買着的人，笑逐顏開的拿着票子到領欵處去領欵，不着的人，悵然地把票子向地上一拋，有的恨恨地把票子撕得粉碎，算是洩他胸頭之價。這樣一盤，二盤，······以至八盤，自第九盤起，又換上另一組的六個球員，直到十六盤打完，全塲的人，方才紛紛離座，潮水般的擁出了球塲的大門。看臺上䞉下一排一排的空椅，地板上滿堆着五色繽紛的廢票，這些廢票，在不久以前，都是用白花花的洋錢花綠綠的鈔票去換來的，如今連一個銅子也不値了！門首的汽車，橫七堅八的來迎接球塲裏出來的主人，兩三個巡捕，照料指揮車輛的進退，紛撎了半個鐘頭，方才漸告平靜。這是辣斐德路到環龍路口一段，停着許多黃包車，他們是在等候球塲中散出的主顧，但一見巡捕駕着脚踏車由北向南駛來，他們立刻拉起空車，飛步奔跑，幾十個車夫拖着空車在馬路上飛奔，彷佛是舉行一種拖車竸走，不幸逃得慢一點，被巡捕追着，還得挨幾下木棍。</p>
<p>球塲附近的人行道上，站着幾個面有菜色的女丐，抱着小孩，向球塲中散出来的「老爺」「太太」「少爺」「小姐」討錢，可是「老爺」「太太」「少爺」「小姐，」不惜把整千整百的鈔票洋錢在回力球塲送掉，却不肯破費一二個銅子來給窮人，所以照例是「掉頭不顧。」</p>
<p>一個買票的僕歐，隨着衆人散出，他一壁走，一壁檢點手中球客給他的角子票，看看數目不多，便感覺不滿足。「赤老！中國人眞犯賤！爲什麼要送錢給外國人用？」他以牢騷了，他的話很對，可是他忘了自己是在做赤老的奴隸！</p>

<h3>糧食厚粳鮮貨交活價提</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三四十號、銷路本街店胃尙可、但都屬意新鮮之貨、故蘇同帮及南港等新鮮厚粳價提高數分至角許、惟中次貨仍站定、常帮厚粳以胃呆反覺疲軟、包胃仍袍千餘包、兼之剔選嚴厲、是以靑角松泗等薄稻價猶無軒輊、杜洋尖亦相仿、變元無榮辱、陰元乃以乏貨胃活、價獨㒻秀、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源二十七八號、白粳去路稍化、巿形定勢薄稻到貨續有、零拆鮮次貨續交、中次胃呆巿情頂定次疲、羊杜尖到少消活巿形定立埠客稍化、價形平定、白元疲近尺</p>
<h3>粉巿無大動靜</h3>
<p>|本月份標準仍可抽買|</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、呈初穏繼平之象、以洋麥報價、回小三四角左右、惟以廠家望、一致擯拋、業外人心、遂稍帶起、近期因客帮略有交易、好至七分半、遠期亦爲帶上一點不過出入甚少、冷寂異常、迨至下午開盤、以天時尙佳、業外買戶、仍少交易、小廠略有出檔、開價均見帶疲、觀此種情形、彷彿廠家與各戶、均待新麥旺到後、再作計較也、結果本月份較小二釐半、七八九月份不動、十月份小二釐半、十一月份好二釐半、本月份標準仍有抽買並無限制云、</p>
<h3>麥巿盤旋中帶穏勢</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面、在盤旋中略轉穏、勢以天時陰晴、各產區之麥收、因此遲緩、卽以所到之貨品而言、身分均感不足、在此旺令之際、未免略見失望、雖事實上之需要並不迫切、人心不免爲之轉定矣、結果本月份未開、七月份好一分、八九月份好二分、餘未開、現新麥情形仍然平定、各路車船麥逐有裝到、大廠均無進意、小廠則揀高應酬開和州麥三元九角、浦鎭麥三元九角、次至八角、蕪湖麥三元八角四分、計一千三百餘包由華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>南北貨新茘枝干歉收居多</h3>
<p>茘枝干今庚各產區收成豐歉不一、如海口大約不過二分、廣東三四分漳州却有八九分、其次如泉州之元紅枝花苗尙好、但出數本屬不多、興化聞亦平平、惟近來銷路至呆、大勢雖屬歉多豐少、屆時出新、巿價仍恐不能過高、</p>

<h3>良心問題</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>翻開今天的報紙，在許多戲院廣告中間，發現了四個黑底白字的大字|「良心問題·」上面還刋着「解决」二個小字，緊靠着旁邊，便是輓聨式的二行帶詰問口氣長句，第一行是「爲國犧牲的抗歌將士們露骨暴屍·碧血未乾，你忍心嗎？」第二行是「忠勇殘廢的殺賊弟兄們，臂斷脛折，呻吟牀第，你忍心嗎？」這確是給我一記當棒喝，「久矣乎」我巳懐疑我的「良心」不在了，所以聽到二字頗有揭着瘡疤似的感想。</p>
<p>爲着「解决」二字的引誘吧，於是細看下去，但不幸給我的是一個失望，底下一連着十有餘位「女士」「	先生」的名字，在每一個女士或先生的名字底下，又都注上什麼「舞」什麼「曲」之類，最後一行是「售劵處，各大公司商店。」這原是「上海仕女聨歡社」至辦的一個「慰勞華北傷兵游藝茶舞會」的廣告，細看全文，除了「女士」「名媛」「舞，舞，舞，」「曲，曲，曲，」之外並無半字「良心」道及，我疑心這不是撰稿先生中途換了題目，便是手民排錯了版，直到三讀之下，始恍然大悟，這原是「仕女」們|即高等華人是也|「解决」「良心問題」的妙法，而與一般雖屬華人而並非高等的大衆無干。「慰勞華北傷兵」，這是多麼莊嚴的一個名詞，而必須以「游藝茶舞會」出之，深歏國人「良心」的麻痺，己到非用强列的利誘色誘不可的時期，覺得頗有點惴惴焉，而主辦者能獨具隻眼，看破國民的弱點，巧爲利導，也是不可多得的事，費大洋數元，一登大華大滬之廳，旣可飽饜歌舞，而「良心問題」也同時解决，華北傷兵也蒙其福，豈不價廉物美，一舉而三得，鳴呼，游於藝，死於藝，懿歟休哉。</p>
<p>最後，我還得抄那輓聨式的兩行長句，作爲本文的結束。爲國犧牲的抗敵將士們，露骨暴屍，碧血未乾，您忍心嗎？忠勇殘廢的殺賊弟兄們，臂斷脛折，呻吟牀第，您忍心嗎？</p>

<p>— 也威</p>
<p>五千方里阻屯兵，消息傳來熱淚盈，戰骨何辜埋絕塞，征旗無復出長城，白山黑水空勞夢，倭雨胡風永障晴，慚愧偏安成一局，塘沽不惜屈爲盟，</p>
<p>百年哀此劫中身，事物紛前蔽我眞，莽莽風雲窮變幻，滔滔天地滿貪䐜，喧豗久厭人間世，簡略長懐太古民，早有逍遙塵外想，不知何處結仙鄰，</p>
<h3>五花八門的名字</h3>
<p>— 愼敏</p>
<p>吾國地廣人衆，方言不同，僅以名字而論，亦因地而異，雖風土人情之使然，其原因不能不歸各於敎育之不普及呢！如本巿鄕下人所生的子女，呌做阿毛·阿狗·老虎·小貓，阿龍，阿兔等名字，不勝枚舉，好好的人名上冠以走獸畜牲字樣，則不大高明吧！據說這種名字，是他們做父母的生了子女，不覺歡天喜地，當爲心肝寶貝，所以不約而同的你也呌阿毛，我也呌阿狗，也無所謂大方不大方，雅致不雅致了。而且他們生了子女，尙未滿月的時候，必先請一位算命的瞎子先生，排算八字，假如這個小孩子五行全備，呌做全行，或者呌做全生，五行缺金，呌做金生，五行缺木，呌做木林，五行缺水，呌做阿海，阿河。五行缺火，呌做阿火，五行缺土，呌做阿土生，所以俗語有阿土生阿木林的譏諷，其實阿土生不一定土頭土腦的，阿木林不一定木頭木腦的，不過拿這種大興土木的名字，說說笑話罷了。更有以阿大，阿二，「讀義」阿三，阿四，阿五，阿六，阿七，阿八等喚做名字，他們雖有排行之表示，然名字上面，加了一個阿字，似乎有些土頭土腦，，沒有怎麼意義可言了。上海人家所雇的蘇州大姐，大槪呌做阿金姐，阿巧姐，阿寶姐，阿五阿六姐，吳儂軟語的芳名·比較的來得香艷一點。况是蘇州地方·山明水秀·靈氣獨鍾，所以人才傑出·名士獨多，餘鄕問婦女，來申帮傭的啥姐啥姐外·其各界士女的雅篆，都是溫文爾雅，而且帶有一些藝術化，請瞧一瞧吳中的許多小說名家的署名就可知道其風流瀟灑了。至於江北同志的大名，則另有作風，如小三子，小四子，三六子等，眞所謂有子萬事足了。而哈拉哈拉的崇明朋友，則用義郎，祥郎，福郎，金郎等，大槪以郎字爲標準，崇明朋友，畢竟多情多義，你也一聲郎，吾也一聲郎，呌得非常之恩愛。寗波人的名字，大槪也用阿字打頭的居多數，如阿德哥，阿順哥，阿發哥，阿友哥，阿祥哥：阿根哥等雅篆，中面外加了一個「哥」字，似乎很溫柔面帶着一些肉麻性。吾曾經到過吳江縣屬之盛澤鎭地方·該處的人名·男子都是官·如　官·祥官·順官·明官之類，女子則用寶，如鳳寶，林寶，桂寶，珍寶之屬。聽來聽去，都是男皆官，無女不寶了。這是鄕方處處別，風土人情，各地方言，不能充一，所以然者，難怪國家大事，安有統一之望呢！</p>
<h3>無語凝咽</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>船到上海的時候，天色還是黑的；我心眞跳得厲害！我再也不要在暗悶的艙中蟄伏着了：但同時我又希望天色慢些見發白，好讓我再逗留一會見：我厭惡船艙的沉悶，但我尤感到見病父的難堪。這猶如一個待决的罪犯一面威着獄居生活的厭惡，一面却又望行刑時間無限地拖延一樣。我站在甲板上，看那無數的旅客像洪潮般的向黑暗的碼頭衝去，喧鬧的呌囂聲充滿着「到了呀！」的快慰的情緒，這聲音震破了我愁悶的心靈，我忽然想到我就可見到爸爸了！我的心頭也掠過一陣愉快。</p>
<p>我跳上了街車到大哥的家，我不敢直接就到父親的住所去，我曉得父親他是不情願我告了假來看他病的，他一見我一定要引起不快，以爲他的痛是嚴重了，這是病人一般的心理，而我病一底極度神經衰弱的父親特別會感到這個。父親的病雖然還沒有逹最危險的境地，却已到了痛苦的尖端了：口麻木到不能講話，手麻木到不能寫字，上身除了左手外完不能動彈了。雖然他神志理解是淸晰的可是逹意的言語力消失了：雖然他胃量依然和平常一樣，可是消化的咀嚼力被剝奪了，這是多麼痛苦的病爺偏偏落在我最怕痛苦的父親身上！大哥和嫂子姪兒們都到父親那裏去了，大哥家裏只有我們的老阿哥在着，他在被窩中詳細地告訴我父親的病狀，禁不住撲　　的落淚了。過了一會，大哥從父親那裏來一見了他，使我又悲又喜。本能的「哥哥」二字竟在我底喉嚨裏咽住了，一股熱淚從眼眶裏衝出來，我不敢正視他，我背過臉去看別的，他也沒有話，凄凉的沉默窒塞着全室。負起怖悲挹的心，我終於跟大哥去看父親了，在路上，我極力排去一切惡幻的雜念，奮勇前進着。跨進了家門，我的脚就不自覺地軟下來我禁不住哭了，母親也哭，姑母也哭。先由老阿哥去對父親說我來了，是爲了學校放紀念假來的，於是我拭乾了眼睛，輕輕地走到樓上父親的病室。父親躺在朝外的沙發椅上，正裝着手勢和人說話，然而手勢所表示的終是得不到人家的理解，他終於嘆了口氣，疲倦地放下手。我抑制着滿腔的酸楚，裝作高興的樣子乘機奔到父親面前：『爸爸,學校放了幾天假,所以我出來一次,　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　父親一眼望見了我,恨駭異地一跳,他的上身突然向前動了一動用力要想起來,然而不能;他的嘴唇擻擻地抖着，要想講話，然而不能；他以全付的目光注視着我，將要枯竭的眼淚一滴一滴的潤濕了他的眼角，他提起僅有的活動的左手接連地指着我，表示「你何必來？」的意思。過了一會，他又把我拉過去擁抱着，我的臉偎貼在父親的懐裏。唉，消瘦的父親是更消瘦了，我給他緊握着的手竟覺得有些兒痛，父親的手全是骨節了啊！我望着要和藹而靜穆的臉，我覺得我是浸漬在神聖的慈愛中，我覺得我是世界上的幸運兒，我覺得我是永遠不會離開父親的懐抱的。可不是麼？蓬勃的生命力像正在慈父的臉上閃耀啊！父親突然把我推開了。然而，一霎那間，我給父親沉重的嘆聲打斷了思想，五，七。</p>
<h3>上海的三種老爺</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在這裏所說的老爺，並不是因爲他們有錢而稱之謂老爺，衹因爲他們的勢利的色彩，和無名的權威，的確巳和科舉時代的那些老爺差不多了；因此在上海人看來，也誰都公認這三種老爺了。在談話中，時常會隨口說出「㐅㐅老爺：」「㐅㐅老爺！」來的，在這裏所說的三種老爺，便是「茶房老爺，」「倒老爺，」和「巡捕老爺。」這三種名稱，雖然是可算上海大辭源中的新名詞，可是想讀者早巳是聽熟了多時閒話休多，言歸正傳，下面就談談這三種老爺吧？</p>
<p>（一）茶房老爺開頭先說茶房老爺，上海人呌男僕不說用人，而稱茶房，巳有三分奇特，做茶房總是一個僕役有什麼希罕要知你如果做了一個政治機關中的茶房眞是非常的神氣呢！有人去訪問官長嗎？坐汽車去也許不會得罪你，倘然兩脚車走去嗎，那茶房的眼裏，早巳看不上你，面孔鐵板，有時竟中途拒絕你去拜見，就是替你去通知也總是白白眼睛走路慢吞吞，似乎不屑爲你奔波的樣子，弄得不好，會罵你幾句山門，當你土老兒，那時你的心裏，雖是無名火高三尺，但要拜訪官長，接見不接見，一半權操在茶房手裏，不能得罪他祇有忍氣吞聲，所謂「呌化子不拿棒，受狗的氣！」這些茶房，當然不無老爺的架子。再次我們說學校裏的茶房，他們對於校長的差遣，唯命是從，但一般職位較低的敎員，差起他們來，總「死骨侖吞，」「眼白無陽，」死不死，活不活：不情不願的樣子，他們的架子眞不小，一般的敎員學生，對於這種茶房，祇有冠上「老爺」兩字，名之謂「茶房老爺」了。</p>
<p>（二）倒老爺</p>
<p>這裏所謂「倒，」並不是「倒霉」的倒，是「倒馬桶」的倒，在我們鄕下，倒馬桶是女人的唯一要務，可是在上海，却由男人倒的，所以你如果第一次到上海，看見男人倒馬桶，會非常的奇怪呢！這些倒馬桶的人，因爲也有無上的權威，上海的人們，都稱之謂倒老爺了。在東方人作魚肚色，絲廠女工上工的時候，正是倒老爺上任的時期推着糞車，在馬路上任意橫行，和救火車同樣的怱急，「前有來人，」「格殺勿論！」幸虧那時馬路上行人不多，否則每天有人要被糞車輾斃呢！到了每個弄堂裏，人家的門上，「砰！」「碎！」亂敲，嘴裏狂呼着「哎！「「哎！」「馬桶！」「馬桶！」把全弄堂的娘娘，太太，公子，哥兒的好夢，都驚醒了，家裏用的娘姨，管家的主婦。每天早上聽見了倒老爺的呼喝聲，敲門聲，急得不怕天冷，不怕風雪，從被窠裏拔出來，急忙把馬桶送出門口，因爲倒老爺走路無情，你如果不出去，他便要走過了，請你的糞棧起來，家裏馬桶少，會棧不下，祇有快些送出去。所以這倒老爺更是神氣，知道任何人奈他不得盡可殺天到地的橫行里巷，大聲呼喝，無所顧忌，眞是有無上的權威呢！</p>
<h3>給情聖的「良」先生</h3>
<p>良先生：</p>
<p>我是一個最愛讀本刋的同志，當然：你先生的大作，是不會在我眼光下漏過的，就是先生在報上的啓事，我也看見過，懇切的措詞，使我深深認識了先生高尙的人格。</p>
<p>這大槪是個性不同的緣故吧？所以看了先生作品的，這個「寄給我的薇」的標題，就格外引起了我的注意，看了大作以後，除相當欽佩先生文藝外，所或到的，也不僅是同情和不平；的確，在看先生這篇纏綿悽愴的勸告書的時候我也曾揮過幾滴同情的熱淚，尤其是看</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>了這幾句，含有辛酸意味的這幾句，一親愛的你回來吧！一更使我感到心痛。　　假如一個人，在沒有迷失本性的時候，看了這樣懇切的信，我想一定會同情於先生的，不過，在這時戀㚥情熱的薇女士看來，或許反會引起她的鄙視，甚至會把你，這篇滿紙淚痕的勸告書，去當作他們在陶醉後的談笑的資料，良先生，我勸你還是努力你的未來罷。　　即使你這封信能夠激動她弱小的心靈，我想她也是不忍回來的，要爲你名譽上着想，要替他失戀後設想，我說她，恐怕沒有這股勇氣再投到你的懐裏來的，這是我個人的理想，並非是有心要污辱薇女士的人格，當然我是更不忍再來挖苦良先生，的確，我的本心是希望薇女士讀了你的信以後，就回到你的懐裏來，向你很柔順地，懺悔她已往的過失，而和你重溫昔日的恩愛，良先生，你總不至於會悮解我罷！如果在你重獲薇女士的時候，能夠再在本刋上給我一個意外的安慰，當然這是我所最盼望的，末了，良先生，請你允許我這樣同情的高高喊一聲：「薇女士你回來吧！你的良是不能沒有你啊！」</p>

<h3>可否去做贅婿</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我在某大商店內做一個職員，薪水不過二十元之數；環境雖困苦，但還可維持自己的生活。我今年二十四歲，十九歲時，由家長做主，訂了婚約，但我自己不滿意，就在今春解除了。現在······友人介紹，呌我入贅乂姓。對方我也見過，非常滿意。無奈的我家庭方面不允，因爲要掉姓的關係呀！這樣一想，我眞進退兩難丨還有我的名譽上，有沒有關係？請你在店員通訊欄內，給我一個良好的答覆。黃保和謹上</p>
<p>㐅　　㐅　　㐅　　㐅　　㐅</p>
<p>編者：一個人的姓氏，不過用來做個代表罷了；你要是能夠對於你的父母，照現在一樣的關心，那末就改姓，也有什麼妨害呢。現在有一班人，娶了妻子以後，每每會對於家庭中的各員，視同陌路。這種人，他的姓氏誰不改，但是比了改姓，還要會使父母失望呢！論到婚姻的眞歸，以雙方合作爲原則；本來談不到誰嫁給誰。所以做做贅婿，也是何妨。只須對方確是我理想中的人罷了。</p>
<p>不過贅婿制度，在中國巳有很長的歷史；提起贅婿，每每會使人聨想到「男的要屈服於女的」一層上去。女方的家長，一定會視贅婿爲禁品；反不許他像普通媳婦一樣，與本生父母親族往來，足使一個血性丈夫·覺得有點受不了。這肩似乎應該事前聲明。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（二）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（二）美子，你又哭了嗎？</p>
<p>東洋婆子原還是一個風韻尙好的日本少婦，只是有時沉下臉來，終掩不了她那老經風霜的悲苦的陰影。今天正喜新租出了樓上兩間大房子，這個月總算不怕有空租的恐慌了。無如阿珍日裏來說什麼連亭子間也要租，要李先生搬出去，這使得她的一團熱火落在冰裏，心裏怪難受的。她自揣着，到底要怎樣處置這件事體好呢。立哈洛夫自然是贊成李先生搬，可以多收些房租。於是她便有所動地看着那已經睡熟了的立哈洛夫|她的丈夫，粗鬃似的鬍鬚鳥黑了滿下顎，衣服時常是不整潔的，但歐喜在家裏戴着一頂紅黃色條的尖帽子，這就像徵着他固執堅强的性格一樣。她倆是在日俄戰爭不久幾年便認識的，那時她還不過是五六歳的小姑娘。素來僑居東北，父親與哥都在戰爭中爲大和魂所犧牲，但誰也沒有注意到這因戰而淪爲孤苦伶仃的小美子，使得她不能不跟着大和魂的仇族底這立哈洛夫去生活。那時候立哈洛夫還是一個魁偉的靑年軍官，對於美子的身世十分同情！一種超乎種族觀念的人類憐愛終於使他毅然地把她帶回俄國，他固然是日俄戰爭中的鍵將，且也始終是沙皇的崇拜者，一直到十月革命後才在沙皇的帝翼下流亡到中國由北方而至上海。生活的顚沛流連使他變成了廢人，往日的豪氣全都消磨了。現在雖還是中年的年齡，却已全是老人的心境。除了仰仗着帝俄繁盛時的回憶及作着帝俄復興的幻想外，他是與社會，人類完全隔絕了。過去的親友全都流散着不通消息，美子是更無所謂『熟人』了。所以他們兩人的生活是再沉悶再孤寂也沒有的，美子看着立哈洛夫的睡態，固然引起了一種共患難的悲苦，但立哈洛夫的拘泥，痴板，更不能不引起她一種無可奈何的厭倦。亭子間李先生的靑年活氣，常能引起她無限的安慰，這安慰已在她心裏生了根。但現在這夜的寂寞，把她孤獨地落在感想的廣漠之荒野，她不覺打一個冷痙，想睡，睡好像哭着臉看住她，於是拿起她的琵琶輕輕地彈動，深夜彈琵琶差不多是她的習慣，好像無限的悲苦，無限的幽怨能在她那織指上彈出來似的。琵琶的琤琮之幽音溶解着她的靈魂，使夜成爲更神秘更可追懐的東西了。門鈴忽來衝碎了這如呻如訴的幽韻，她去開了前門，一陣濃郁的香氣從夜冷裏透過來，三姨太巳酣舞歸來，接着便是滳滳塔塔的高跟鞋聲音樂地響到二樓去了。</p>

<h3>嘉寶之怪原來如此係有顧問在幕中主動的</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>葛萊泰嘉寶的怪，是世界上的人認爲當有意味的。但是許多人相信她並不是生性如此怪僻的，恐怕有人在暗中做參謀替她設計的，現在果然發現了她的，主謀的顧問了。</p>
<p>嘉寶的顧問也是好萊鳱的人物，呌做勞勃脫劉RobetReudc他是瑞典的後裔，他生長在喀洛林羣島。許多人說他當初進見嘉寶的時候，曾化去二萬金元。那時候嘉寶在好萊塢已獲得一地位，勞勃脫十分崇拜嘉寶，所以設法同她見面。結果嘉寶果眞同他做了朋友，漸漸地他成了嘉寶的保護人，做她的顧問。嘉寶的行動是他主動的。</p>
<p>勞勃脫的氣槪眞有些像嘉寶的保鑣。他現在三十四歲，他的黃色的眼睛，黑的頭髪，他的上唇留着一堆短鬍子，威嚴非凡。有一次嘉寶到紐約去玩，被外間知道了，新聞記者們以及許多欲一睹廬山眞面目的人都預先埋伏好了，一等到嘉寶來的時候，大家預備祝賀她，替她拍照，使她說話。但是結果給做先鋒的勞勃脫保護着，使嘉寶安然逃走了。勞勃脫對於嘉寶小心非凡。在公園中或者其他的公衆所在，他照顧着嘉寶好像是嘉寶的近身僕。凡是嘉寶所要的東西，無論是吃的用的，都是他親自去採辦。好萊塢的人，不明瞭勞勃脫是嘉寶的什麼人，而竟有認他是嘉寶的侍僕戚的。</p>
<p>嘉寶的一切行動都信賴勞勃脫的話。有一次百老匯有一個舞臺請嘉寶去登臺，嘉寶巳經廳允了，但是勞勃脫勸告她不要去，嘉寶就聽了他的話不去了。據好萊塢的人說，嘉寶本來是個最歡喜交談的人，但自從她受了勞勃脫的保護之後，變成了一個好萊鳱的怪女郎，行蹤莫測了。當嘉寶回到瑞典去之後，勞勃脫接着也到了歐洲，現在嘉寶仍舊聽從勞勃脫的計畫。米高梅公司曾與嘉寶商議，請他回到好萊鳱去，嘉寶曾應允而後又悔約，有人說這也是勞勃脫的主意。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「熱血雄心」HellBelow</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>大光明開幕第一片影片中上技巧出色前天（十四日）晚上，是大光明開幕的第一天，先映的一本新聞片，平平淡淡。一本炭畫，音樂很好，頗能引起一般觀衆的興趣。一本五彩片，雖不見新奇，也算差强人意，「熱血雄心」繼着上塲了。</p>
<p>故事是很平常的，說一個美國大尉愛上了司令的小姐，而她却是一位航空軍佐的夫人。不久那大尉因爲「熱血雄心」的衝動，冒昧用潛水艇去炸了敵軍的軍艦，雖然有功，但是因爲未得司令的命令，所以被逐出海軍。後來大尉喬裝跑進海軍，勸司令小姐去愛她丈夫，自己又向司令剖白往日的錯誤。他復職了，又建立了炸毀敵人軍港的大功，但是他自己也因此而犧牲了生命。這故事是可以說一聲悲壯的吧？爲了成全人家夫婦，犧牲自己情人；爲了</p>
<p>愛護國家，犧牲了個人生命，在提倡「軍國主義」的呼聲下,那大尉又是多麼勇敢,多麼忠誠呢?影片又是這樣的鼓勵人民去作爭城爭地的帝國戰爭。不過大尉的死，我有些不懂，如果他是爲了情人巳經他屬，借此自戕，作愛的犧牲品，而以此爲沽名釣譽的話，他更是無謂的犧牲了有用之身，這死就「輕於鴻毛」了。</p>
<p>導演還不錯，雖然於大段的戀愛，多量的滑稽穿插，全片仍能一貫而下，始終不怠，處處令人感到一種戰事的激烈，緊張而顫動，分幕又是很緊凑的，可以說是全片無疵可指。　　攝影我認爲在技巧上，最令人滿意的了，「天水不分」的那種偉麗畫面，呌人神往，在海底攝的幾個鏡頭，「鐵戟沉沙，「的殘艦碎艇，許多奇異的魚類，作活動佈景，又能用水銀燈，明燦海底，的確是見昕未見。攝影光線能如此合作，眞屬難能可貴，夜景也頗堪贊許，各種軍艦，陳列成陣。對白平平，砲火聲音歷歷可聞，增加不少緊張色彩，化裝道具等，都稱上乘。</p>
<p>作大尉的是RobertMontgomery表情很好，不愧是第一流大明星的榮銜。不過在這片子裏，他一切都顧懦弱，不像一個剛毅男性的大英雄，這一點，我們却不能怪他，本來個性不合，怎能强人所難呢？女郎是梅琪伊文絲MadgeEvans，代表一個美國普遍性的醉心虛榮的女子，恰到好處全片她工作不多，但是要算她最出色了。司令官華爾特赫斯登WalterHuston沉着老練不失爲將軍身份。其餘一些扮海軍軍佐角色的演員們，也都還可看。大鼻子傑美杜倫JimmyDuiante在穿揷上作了重要位置，形容海軍㕑房生活，呌人捧腹不置。　　總之這張片子爲資產階級很好的消遣品，特別爲那些在上海的異國軍人們所感得牠有特殊的興味吧？</p>
<h3>評「現代一女性」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>假如我們把握了現實社會的戀愛的經濟基礎，那末「現代一女性」的題材是比較現實的了。但是編劇而兼主演的艾霞女士是怎樣將這一題材在Film上表現出來的呢？爲了說明這一點，我們得先行叙述故事：</p>
<p>一個地產公司的女職員，爲了自身需要「刺激」，於是在喝酒作樂之外，而熱烈的戀愛着一個收入不豐富的記者。雖然這記者已是兩個孩子的父親，可是她仍然以肉體的交換。從公司經理那裏盜來巨額的金錢，滿足愛人的日用。但不久因盜竊而下獄。然而這主人翁女職員終於不能得着愛人的諒解，於是破滅了戀愛的迷夢，在說明上寫着「前面有的是光明的路，走，海闊天空。」</p>
<p>從銀幕上所給與我們的認識，那末很可以看得出編劇者體念上的矛盾。一般的說，艾霞女士並不歌讚現有的經濟機構，她所最痛恨的便只是金錢破壞了戀愛。所以，主人翁在先認爲只要戀愛能夠「徹底」的陶醉，便可放棄其他一切。到最後也就發現了這種戀愛的「空虛」。可是這主人翁萄萄和余冷的戀愛是建築在什麼上面的呢？他巳經結婚，而且還很愛他的妻子，特別是他並沒有夠化的錢。愛他多情？可是他並沒有給與她好的印象，雖然在字幕上說她和他三年不見，大槪是從前便有了愛情；可是這不是祇以字幕便可代代替畫面的，而且畫面上的萄萄是如此放蕩，很少有人會相信她能如此的忠於情。都末她是愛他美貌嗎？不錯，有許多交際花或妓女之流，常愛小白臉，可是這位主人翁必定要有從多方面得來的很多的錢，才能供他任意揮霍，就使「倒貼」幾個也不在乎。然而萄萄不過是小職員罷了，所以她和他的戀愛根本就不能存在。至於最後的轉變也是很勉强的，雖然我們並不否認那種可能性。不過這種描寫强烈個性的女人，在中國銀幕上到底少見·然而如此「徹底的戀愛」，對於中國社會，並沒有何等補益。</p>
<p>關於其他方面的技巧，那末導演對於畫面編輯方面的Montage，還算淸楚。主角表演的大膽，是中國銀幕上空前未有的；熱烈的吻·瘋狂的擁抱，露骨的戀愛把戲：雖然這對於觀衆並不是好的刺激。佈景者，將小職員的家庭裝成一所十分富有的大公館，這也是導演的錯誤。</p>
<p>然而這一影片，有一部份觀衆看了也是很開心的吧，然而這正是本片的「成功」。</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Willing to Surrender Military Power; Overall Situation Basically Resolved</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiyong Returns to Ping from Zhangjiakou; Feng Hopes Song Zheyuan Returns to Chahar (Beiping) Song Zheyuan's representative, Zhang Jiyong, telegraphed Ping this morning, reporting that the meeting with Feng Yuxiang was satisfactorily concluded. He is scheduled to return to Ping tonight or tomorrow morning to report. It is said that Feng has expressed that since the Central Government has ordered Song to return to Chahar, and someone is responsible for the defense of Chahar, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army is unnecessary. The Central Government can also express that after Feng abolishes the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, his stay in Chahar or residence in Ping will be at his own discretion. Therefore, a peaceful resolution is generally possible. Song will go to Chahar to handle everything after the Central Government issues the repatriation order. It is said that Feng intends to move to Pingdiquan. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang has drafted another telegram, stating that since Song Zheyuan has returned to his post and someone is responsible for Chahar Province, there is no question of his own departure. He will issue it after Zhang Jiyong returns to Ping. The internal situation in Chahar Province remains complex. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Jiyong and others held a meeting with Feng in Zhangjiakou and resolved seven items, mostly Feng's opinions requesting adoption by the authorities: (1) Feng issued a proclamation taking office as Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Army because the Japanese army was plotting against Chahar, and Dolon and Guyuan fell successively, making Beiping and Tianjin critical, so he telegraphed to take office to resist Japan. (2) Song was the most vigorous in resisting Japan at Xifengkou. If he can return to Chahar, he can protect the local area. It is hoped that Song will return to Chahar. (3) Sun Dianying has contributed to the anti-Japanese cause and is eager to develop the Northwest, which is beneficial to the country. It is hoped that this will be realized. (4) Fang Zhenwu ruined his family to serve the country. Please ask Song to convey to the government to give him a military title so that he can thoroughly advocate his ideas. (5) The righteous army units of Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and Fu Chun traveled thousands of miles. Please ask the authorities to unify their organization and provide them with supplies according to their original salaries. (6) Regarding his own problem, if Song can return to Chahar and someone is responsible for Chahar Province, he will naturally resign. The more than 20,000 men under his command, Ji Hongchang and Tong Linge, are willing to let Song be fully responsible for reorganizing them, whether as brigades or divisions, it doesn't matter. (7) Abolishing the title is not a problem, but regarding the procedures, whether to issue another telegram will be decided after Song returns to Chahar. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Jiyong and Others Confer with Feng</h3>

<h3>Fang's Army Concentrated Near Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Most of Fang Zhenwu's army has arrived and concentrated near Zhangjiakou. More than a thousand men are still stationed in Xuanhua. A part of Feng Zhanhai's troops was found again south of Xuanhua. Fang's troops are still digging trenches for defense near Xuanhua. The area of Tianzhen and Yongjiabao is guarded by Li Fuying's army of the Jin army. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang told reporters this morning that he took office as Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Army last month because the situation in Chahar Province was critical, Beiping and Tianjin were shaken, and he received letters and telegrams from all sides blaming him. When Wang Faqin, Li Liejun, Huang Shaoxiong, and Huang Shaogu came to Zhangjiakou, he advocated using force to recover the lost territory and was determined to do his best to sacrifice, not to leave and be scolded by the people. Not leaving Zhangjiakou is the same as waiting for death. Also, because Zhao Chengshou resisted Japan in Dolon, and traitors were discovered in the rear, resulting in the loss of Dolon, he originally intended to send troops to Zhangbei to take the enemy's rear, but he was afraid of repeating Zhao Chengshou's mistakes, so he first eliminated the internal problems. Although Zhang Jiuqing is an old friend, because he had dealings with Zhang Haipeng and Liu Guitang, in order to eliminate future troubles and avoid hindering our anti-Japanese work, he placed him under surveillance. As for Wu Yong, he has already left, so he ordered Tong Linge to act as chairman. Tong was appointed by Song as garrison commander. Now the situation has changed, and he hopes that Song will return to Chahar immediately. Pang sent a letter to explain the misunderstanding, and he has replied to express his understanding.

<h3>League of Nations Informs Member States and the United States to Strictly Implement Non-Recognition of Pseudo-Organizations and Prevent Pseudo-Organizations from Joining International Conventions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations informed its member states and the United States, asking them to take strict action to prevent the pseudo-organization of Manchuria from attempting to gain formal international status. The letter stated that the pseudo-organization intends to obtain participation in various peace conventions, especially the Kellogg-Briand Pact, by some means. Therefore, the League of Nations asks member states to take various measures within their power to implement the League of Nations' position of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" adopted on February 24 and to prevent "Manchukuo" from formally joining any international convention, including the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The letter also pointed out that anyone wishing to join the Kellogg-Briand Pact must be handled through the United States. Therefore, it is suggested that if "Manchukuo" requests to join the pact, the United States should consult with the signatory countries, and the countries should immediately answer with disagreement. In addition, the letter listed several steps that must be taken, detailing many procedures, such as asking countries not to recognize the postage stamps of pseudo-organizations.

<h3>Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen Console Wounded Soldiers Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>Returning to Nanjing After a Week of Rest in Guling (Nanchang) Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen went to Beitan on the morning of the 15th to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In the afternoon, they went to the hospitals of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th armies to console the wounded soldiers and awarded wounded officers and soldiers ten yuan each, lieutenants five yuan, and soldiers one yuan, totaling more than 1,800 yuan. Ma Zhanshan was almost in tears when he saw the wounded soldiers with crippled legs and broken arms. Then, Ma gave speeches to the wounded officers and soldiers in each hospital, roughly saying that the wounded soldiers who suppressed bandits and the wounded soldiers who resisted Japan were honored to serve the country. He deeply felt that to save the country, one must first eliminate bandits, and only internal peace can repel foreign aggression. He hoped that everyone would take good care of themselves, continue the past spirit, work hard, eliminate the Red bandits, and then unite against foreign enemies. Also, Ma and Su are scheduled to leave the province on the morning of the 16th for a short rest in Guling and will return to Beijing. Ma told reporters from the Central News Agency on the 15th that he had visited Chiang Kai-shek in the morning and had roughly settled everything.

He will return to Beijing in a week. As for the timing of his trip north, it has not yet been determined.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Use of Cotton and Wheat Loans Ming</h3>
<p>The public remarks made by Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, on the 14th of this month, stated that this cotton and wheat loan would definitely not allow our country's agricultural products to be affected by stagnation. Furthermore, according to the "Industrial Plan," the use will be determined, using this loan to improve agricultural production and rectify agricultural transportation, and it will be concentrated on the construction of new agriculture. This kind of responsible remark is sufficient to dispel the doubts of the general public. If the use of the cotton and wheat loan can truly be as expected by Wang, then this 50 million US dollars will be the savior of today's collapsing rural areas. In recent years, our country's national economy has declined to the extreme. Rural bankruptcy is especially worrying. When the news of the successful large loan came, those who agreed were pleased that it could supplement our national economy, while those who doubted were afraid that it would affect the price of domestic agricultural products. Today, Wang's remarks indicate that the authorities will avoid the ills that generally worry people. This is what we are happy to hear.</p>
<p>What is obtained in this cotton and wheat loan is cotton and wheat. Spinning mills and flour mills can thus gain a new turning point, and the troubled rural areas may also have the possibility of recovery. Moreover, the natural disaster in Shaanxi is extremely severe, with millions of farmers displaced. If the government uses this large batch of foreign wheat for long-term, low-interest loans to the area, then Shaanxi's vitality will not be difficult to restore in two or three years. As for the northern provinces, such as the military disaster in eastern Tianjin, the barrenness of Gansu and Henan provinces, and the economic exhaustion of Shanxi, if the government can use this large loan to implement planned facilities, it can also solve their current difficulties. In Jiangxi and Hubei, the Red disaster has not been eliminated, and the impact is that people cannot maintain their minimum standard of living. If a part of this large amount of cotton and wheat is re-loaned to the people, then farmers along the Yangtze River will gain a chance of survival, which will also be beneficial to the progress of bandit suppression.</p>
<p>However, we still cannot avoid worrying. Since the founding of the Republic of China, our country has borrowed foreign debt more than once. Most of it has been used for military expenses, and even transferred and flowed into the deposit accounts of foreign banks. The resulting malpractice has cultivated a psychology of fear of foreign debt among the people. Now, the National Government is borrowing the first foreign debt since the success of the revolution. We deeply hope that the government can fulfill the words of the responsible person and ensure that this loan is used to improve agricultural production in order to save the current crisis in the national economy.</p>

<p>The Fourth Day of the Economic Conference</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Explains China's Position</h3>
<p>Willing to cooperate with other countries to jointly save the crisis. Hoping to stabilize silver prices and increase trade. Welcoming foreign trade to develop vast resources. Rejecting the concept of the Asian Monroe Doctrine</p>
<h3>The General Debate Ended Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Russian representative formally proposed an economic truce. The chairmen of the Economic and Monetary Committees are elected. (London) The Economic Conference continued its general assembly at 10:34 this morning. As the UK and the US have reached an agreement on the war debts of June, there has been a significant improvement in the atmosphere of the conference. Prime Minister MacDonald was absent due to business. Foreign Minister Hyman of Belgium presided over the meeting. Foreign Minister Da Mata of Portugal gave a speech, stating that Portugal will restore the gold standard once the international monetary exchange rate is set, but the Portuguese government still reserves the right to determine the gold content of the Portuguese currency. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen then took the stage to speak, saying that China came to participate in this conference with the sincere desire to cooperate with countries around the world to find a permanent solution to the world economic crisis. The current problems are indeed difficult, but if they are approached with honesty and the necessary determination, these problems are not unsolvable by mankind. The participants bear a major responsibility, as the rewards of success and the punishments of failure are incalculable. The failure of the conference will not only prolong the haggard situation but will also cause those responsible for managing the world to lose credibility. The success of the conference will lead to a larger and more stable era of prosperity. Song then spoke about China's policy outline of preparing to cooperate with other countries and the special contributions that China can offer. When he spoke about the main elements in China's position, he stated that other countries have overproduction, while China suffers from insufficient production, insufficient development, and weak purchasing power. Comparing China's development with that of the United States, China has only 7,000 miles of railways, while the United States has 275,000 miles. China has 20,000 miles of motor roads, while the United States has 3 million miles. Other forms of industrial and commercial development are also very different from each other. China's foreign trade has indeed increased, but in terms of its population, it is still very small. In 1932, it only reached 4 billion national currency. Some countries participating in this conference have a foreign trade of about 150 pounds per household, while China only has about seven shillings per household. China is a country with abundant natural resources that have not yet been developed and whose people are hardworking and strive for progress, accounting for one-fifth of the world's population. Given China's position, what will happen in the future? First, if China's standard of living is raised, as we want to do, then its purchasing power can not only absorb the products of the country's own industry but can also become the world's largest market and become a very large element in the new era of prosperity. Second, China has the greatest possible opportunity for profitable use of both Chinese and foreign capital. It is hoped that world politics can find a way and method that meets the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen of consolidating China's political and economic independence on the one hand and providing Western capital and industry and commerce with a profitable development scope on the other hand. Song then spoke about China's contributions in policy and behavior, stating that the first task of various countries is to steadily establish their own systems, and the second task is to cooperate with other countries in a steady world policy. Amidst the various difficulties that do not need to be elaborated, China does have reason to boast of some achievements. The current Chinese government has been supported by the people and has made the 1932 budget balance, and it has also achieved success in sorting out the internal mines. Song continued, saying, I do not want you to infer from this that we can pay attention to the various foreign debts borrowed by China before the establishment of the National Government in 1927, some of which have not been fulfilled. However, the Chinese government has supported itself without borrowing foreign debt in the autumn of national difficulties, internal troubles, world economic panic, and foreign aggression. Then, when these difficulties are partially or completely eliminated in the future, it is not impossible for China to repay its legitimate debts. This also shows that China has achieved the great project of rebuilding the Yangtze River embankment that was destroyed by the great flood of 1931. There are 4,000 Chinese technicians monitoring this project, and the workers they command sometimes reach 1.4 million. The embankment is 5,000 miles long, and the project is quite solid. Although there was a major flood in 1932, there has been no harm to date. The area where 43 million people lived in the previous year was flooded, but last year there was a bumper harvest. The League of Nations has provided China with technically valuable assistance in this problem, and it has also provided much assistance in other economic issues. This is something that can be happily stated. Song then spoke about the silver problem, stating that the West is now feeling the difficulties of daily fluctuations in currency value affecting foreign trade, and is thinking of relieving it in this conference. China also has this same difficulty, because although China's currency is a precious metal, silver prices have drastic fluctuations in its relationship with gold coins and non-gold coins. Silver prices are currently very low. He personally hopes that silver prices will also rise when the value of other goods rises compared to gold. He believes that the stable value of silver is more important than the rise of silver prices. Therefore, he hopes that when seeking the stability of gold coins, stability should also be sought for silver, because silver is the currency of hundreds of millions of people in China and is also closely related to the common people in India. Song then briefly described the cooperation policy that China has adopted, stating that a small number of people in China and a large number of people in other Asian countries believe that Asia does not need to imitate others, and the West is not to be feared, and advocated the combination of Western technology and low Eastern living standards, believing that this can seize the world market, and in the name of "Asia for Asians" and the so-called "Asian Monroe Doctrine," exclude Western cooperation. In fact, this kind of doctrine is contrary to our Chinese concept of international interaction. We do not want to adopt this kind of doctrine. We will also oppose the isolation of countries or regions. This is our policy. This is the definite policy of our government to develop China's consumption power. We want to transform the country so that it can raise its standard of living. The economic development and the opening up of our country's resources are always the most important things for us. We want to achieve this goal and benefit from it in a way that can enhance international cooperation. We welcome Western capital and skills and maintain a financial policy that does not prevent foreign goods from entering the country. It has been several years since China freed itself from the outdated treaty restrictions and restored its full tariff autonomy. China has not yet used this freedom to build protective tariffs. Not only that, but China also wants to view the world as an economic unit, so that countries can develop along the lines that best suit the nature of their people's abilities. China does not want to adopt the empty talk of economic self-sufficiency. China's tariffs are generally lower than those of other countries. The collection of tariffs is purely for national income. Anyone who knows the difficulties of China's direct taxes will know why China's tariffs are important. China has not added restrictions to trade, such as quotas. Although silver prices have fallen, and the government has therefore felt difficulties, it has not adopted restrictions on exchange rates. We will adhere to the policy of not making artificial restrictions, because we firmly believe that we can not only increase the benefits to the world in this way but also promote the vast social and political interests behind the economic development policy that I have just mentioned. China is confident that based on these principles, it can proceed with its transformation and can obtain the greatest possible assistance in its progress and become a new large market, whose latent consumption power may be a factor in promoting the true and permanent recovery of the entire world. Although this conference is naturally limited to discussing economic and monetary issues, this issue is actually related to the issue of military reduction, especially to the issue of national security. If we want to separate and isolate these interrelated events, it is almost impossible. If the issues of military reduction and security have not been satisfactorily resolved, and we rashly believe that the success of this conference is sustainable, then we are lacking in understanding of the actual knowledge.

<p>#### Prime Minister of Canada Endorses British Monetary Policy</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Bennett continued Song's speech, saying that he endorsed the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's proposal on currency yesterday. The UK and the US should immediately start to stabilize currency prices. When the UK and the US stabilize their exchange rates, Canada will stabilize its currency price in London. As for the economic aspect, he believes that the conference must not be too cautious and miss the opportunity. Canada agrees to implement an economic truce during the conference, but exercising a truce that exists in the current state cannot be fully effective.</p>
<p>At that time, Hyman replaced MacDonald as chairman. Hyman then announced that the important meeting of the Main Committee scheduled for noon today has been postponed to the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Irish Representative Makes Startling Remarks</h3>
<p>When Connolly, Minister of Land of the Irish Free State, rose to speak, there were few listeners. Connolly said that the conference must not refuse to consider any suggestion that can make the facts fully realized, even if it is not orthodox. For example, although the Irish Free State is not concerned about the bimetallic system, it is willing to oppose the decision of the Preparatory Committee not to regard silver as a monetary standard. The report of the committee mostly expresses the trend of stating judgments and is almost completely biased towards conventions. The entire mechanism of international exchange rates should be placed under international management and should be removed from the jurisdiction of those who use it for speculation or profiteering. Connolly then suggested making the International Clearing Bank the clearinghouse for international exchange rates and communicating with the central banks of various countries. He finally asked the conference to replace the policy of fortune with a sensitive plan, saying that attention should be paid to the gradual reduction of the labor component of production. The entire issue of regulating labor must be considered. The conference should aim to recast the foundation of economic life from a social and humanitarian standpoint.</p>
<p>MacDonald returned to his chair while Connolly was speaking, so he heard part of Connolly's speech. The conference adjourned at 12:50 to 3:00 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian resolution was handed over to MacDonald by Litvinov just before the announcement of the adjournment. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>The Russian Delegation Proposes an Economic Truce</h3>
<p>(London) The Soviet Russian delegation drafted a resolution and handed it over to MacDonald, Chairman of the World Economic Conference, this morning. The content of the resolution is as follows: 1. The governments of the countries represented at the General Assembly remember the spirit of the economic truce listed in the resolution of the Organizing Committee of May 12, 1933, and are willing to guarantee that this truce has the fullest possible effect. Therefore, they agree to mutually revoke all legislative and administrative plans that have been passed and are still in effect, and that contain the nature of economic aggression or discrimination against any country, such as special taxes imposed on goods from any country, prohibition of exports and imports to any country, special regulations imposed on exports and imports to any country, and trade boycotts of any country, regardless of the purpose contained in this plan.</p>
<h3>The Afternoon Reconvened to End the Debate</h3>
<p>The number of people attending the meeting this morning was particularly small. The meeting reconvened at 3:03 PM. First, Islanda, the representative of the Dominican Republic, gave a speech, generally discussing everything. Then, Chairman Hyman formally announced the receipt of the Soviet Russian resolution against boycotts and other economic retaliations. Then, Turkish representative Ruishi Di spoke, only stating the economic situation in his country. Mexican representative Dr. Pani then gave a speech, advocating the increase in silver prices. After that, the representatives of Albania, Peru, Greece, Latvia, and Haiti Venezuela gave speeches successively. When the chairman asked the representatives of New Zealand and Brazil to speak, both were absent. New Zealand representative Forbes arrived two minutes late, but the general debate has ended today. The chairman, Hyman, announced at that time that the speakers of the reports had all finished speaking, so the meeting was adjourned so that the Main Committee could meet at 5:00 PM, at which time MacDonald would make an announcement. Therefore, today's afternoon meeting ended at 5:15. Twenty minutes later, the Main Committee began to meet. (Reuters Press Agency Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Significant Developments in Anglo-American-French Currency Parity Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London Dispatch) The most significant development at today's World Economic Conference is the "close stability" regarding the parity of the pound sterling, US dollar, and French franc among Britain, America, and France, with an agreement largely reached. The American representative, Cox, has confirmed that an actual stability in the exchange rates of the three countries' currencies is on the verge of agreement.</p>
<p>Only some details remain to be resolved. However, he stated that these negotiations are extremely complex and difficult, and premature disclosure of the contents could jeopardize success. Unless there are unexpected developments, an official announcement is expected soon. It is said that one of the details still to be resolved, according to Cox, is a difference of opinion between US President Roosevelt and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, which is currently being negotiated and is expected to be agreed upon. When this was asked of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain neither denied nor confirmed it, and he also declined to explain the meaning of the so-called "close stability." He only acknowledged that negotiations are ongoing. Chamberlain stated, "We are currently discussing these matters, and there has been progress in recent days. There is hope that these negotiations will be successfully concluded during the conference period, but it is not yet convenient to comment." However, reporters have also learned from other sources that the phrase "close stability" is a British approach to preventing large fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the pound sterling at present, but it does not determine a permanent parity between the two currencies. It is said that although Britain is eager to reach an agreement as soon as possible to limit large fluctuations in exchange rates, it is unwilling to stipulate a parity at this time in order to allow the economic conference to formulate a permanent and universal currency reform plan.

<h3>General Debate Concludes</h3>
<p>Audience Interest Wanes; Half the Seats Empty (London Dispatch) The representatives' interest in the general debate of the conference is gradually waning. This can be seen from the fact that half of the seats in the conference hall were empty this morning. The general debate is expected to conclude today. The chief representatives of the major powers and some representatives of small countries have all delivered speeches. The second step is to organize economic and currency committees. The reports and proposals of the two committees will serve as the basis for subsequent plenary discussions. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Actual Work Begins</h3>
<p>Chairmen of Economic and Monetary Committees Designated (London Dispatch) Today, the Economic Conference has begun to shift to the axis of actual work. After a long period of secret negotiations, it has been agreed to elect the American representative, Cox, as the chairman of the Monetary Committee, with the unexpected appointment of Kemmerer as vice-chairman, and French Finance Minister Bonnet as the rapporteur. Also, Dutch Prime Minister Colijn has been elected as the chairman of the Economic Committee. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Conflict Between France and America</h3>
<p>Contending for the Chairmanship of the Monetary Committee (London Dispatch) Reuters' diplomatic correspondent has learned that a fierce conflict is currently taking place behind the scenes of the World Economic Conference. France and the United States are both vying for the position of chairman of the Monetary Committee, and neither will yield. It has not been resolved since Tuesday. France claims that if this position belongs to the United States, there is a risk of leading to an inflationary policy. If this matter cannot be resolved through discussion, it may be put to a vote, but both sides want to avoid this step. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Expresses Opposition to Stabilization Fund</h3>
<p>Advocates Establishing an International Currency to Maintain Exchange Rates (Tokyo) Ishii, the chief Japanese representative attending the World Economic Conference, stated in a speech at the conference that the Japanese government is prepared to consider appropriate measures to prevent exchange rate declines before the restoration of the gold standard. Regarding the stabilization of exchange rates, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters today that Japan will find it difficult to agree to the proposal to allocate a stabilization fund, because Japan's gold reserves are limited. Takahashi also said that the best way to stabilize exchange rate values is to create an international currency that can be used internationally. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>British Industries Confederation Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>Urging the Government to Encourage Higher Silver Prices (London) The attention given to silver in the speeches and private conversations of the representatives at the Economic Conference has not yet met the expectations of the general proponents of silver. According to several representatives, silver will be discussed in detail when the committee presents the monetary issue, and there is no need to elaborate on it in speeches at this time. It is also heard that the conference has received a resolution from the British Industries Confederation (a representative group of major national commercial firms) stating that the decline in silver prices is sufficient to reduce the demand for manufactured goods from China and India, and that the British government should discuss restoring silver prices. The World Economic Conference should do its best to encourage the adoption of practical and feasible plans to increase silver prices and stabilize the gold-silver ratio. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hull's Speech on the Third Day of the Conference</h3>
<p>(London Dispatch) Yesterday, British Prime Minister MacDonald urged all representatives to arrive at the meeting on time, and all representatives complied. Therefore, when the clock struck for the continuation of the meeting this afternoon, the conference hall was already full. Everyone was eagerly waiting to hear the speeches of US Secretary of State Hull and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. The conference continued at three minutes past three in the afternoon. When Hull slowly ascended the podium, the audience cheered. Hull spoke slowly and clearly.</p>
<h3>Heavy Responsibility</h3>
<p>He said that the turbulent world is now looking to the conference for guidance. It is appropriate for the nations to gather in this famous capital to deal with the common crisis. The urgent need for the 65 nations to select representatives to participate in this conference can be expressed through tragic experience. If this conference disperses in silence, indicating that we cannot formulate sufficient new policies, and that the economic policies that destroyed nations and disrupted the world after the war must continue to be implemented, then wouldn't we be failing the trust placed in us by people everywhere?</p>
<h3>Who Will Take the Blame?</h3>
<p>If one country, focusing on its own temporary interests, delays the relief of the sufferers in all countries, thereby undermining this conference, then this country should be attacked by the people of the world. I have complete confidence in the ability, authority, and purpose of the conference to influence the world. If the conference establishes a process to coordinate with the appropriate domestic processes of various countries to restore trust, work, and prosperity, then this conference can be declared a success.</p>
<h3>Economic Catastrophe</h3>
<p>Hull went on to describe the tragic situation of the world's turbulence in recent years, saying that today's humanity feels more distressed and uneasy than it did twelve years ago. All those participating in this conference should feel from the beginning that the suffering people everywhere expect this conference to have harmonious cooperation and constructive results. The success or failure of this conference will be the success or failure of political maneuvering everywhere, and failure in this emergency era will be permanently marked in history. What we all recognize is that the economic catastrophe and its accompanying losses, suffering, and hardship, unprecedented in our history, have been imposed on all countries and the world for three and a half years. National treasuries are depleted, prices are collapsing, and international finance and commerce have been destroyed. Domestic production and consumption have both decreased significantly. Thirty million workers are unemployed, agriculture is bankrupt, currencies and exchange rates are chaotic everywhere, debt is high, and taxes are extraordinarily heavy. All of these are the painful experiences of recent years.</p>
<h3>Tax Barrier</h3>
<p>To a considerable extent, a country can restore its situation by using appropriate financial and economic methods, as indicated by President Roosevelt's domestic programs. However, the necessity of international economic programs is not diminished by this. Post-war economic nationalism has adopted various methods to obstruct international capital and trade, resulting in international trade decreasing from 500 billion yuan to 150 billion yuan. The tragic results of the short-sighted and insufficiently thoughtful policies adopted after the war in an attempt to reduce various prices to the lowest level can be seen from this. When countries formulate their tax laws, they only pay attention to protecting domestic markets and do not pay attention to the exchange of surplus production. Now is the time for governments to stop building retaliatory tariff barriers.</p>
<h3>Fundamental Blueprint</h3>
<p>Countries are essentially interrelated, so international cooperation has become a fundamental necessity today. We should declare that the economic nationalism adopted by various countries is a policy of losing credibility. Mutually beneficial markets can only be obtained through the liberalization of commercial policies.</p>
<h3>Commercial Liberalization</h3>
<p>And liberalization depends on governments taking the same actions to stabilize exchange rates and currencies, and to make considerable reductions in tariff barriers. Countries can indeed restore their situation to a considerable extent by using appropriate financial and economic methods. Therefore, the Roosevelt administration adopted effective domestic programs within three months to promote the progress of business to the fullest possible extent. Equally important international relief plans are equally needed. This is obvious.</p>
<h3>Reorganizing Tax Laws</h3>
<p>Hull advocated for a gradual and cautious reorganization of excessive tax laws and other trade barriers to a moderate level, neither allowing unreasonable or excessive competition from imports, nor exclusively enjoying the benefits of domestic market prices. This kind of policy can obtain a more stable and prosperous state. Although it does not conform to extreme economic internationalism, it does not endorse extreme economic nationalism. It can also use a broad foreign market to assist an effective domestic market. The economic nationalism practiced after the war has adopted all the methods known to mankind to hinder international capital and trade, such as heavy taxes, quotas, prohibitions, exchange restrictions, and restrictions on cheap currencies. Many governments often change their tax laws and other obstructive measures, resulting in uncertainty and great damage to commerce. These trade barriers everywhere adversely affect production work prices and domestic goods control. Under the devastation of these extreme behaviors, there are many places in the world where people are starving by the millions, and there are also many places where there is a surplus of food that no one absorbs. Raw materials and factories are separated, consumers and factories are separated, and food is separated from consumers. I ask, how many countries can maintain themselves without international trade?</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Currency</h3>
<p>The conference must also address the difficult problem of a permanent international monetary standard, and stipulate the appropriate functions of gold and silver, and the application of this standard. Exchange restrictions should also be eliminated. The US delegation is prepared to make concrete suggestions on the various issues mentioned above. The decline of the international market is sufficient to damage the economic and financial lives of large exporting countries, and to make all foreign trade lose its normality, and to hinder various productions, and to lose the jobs of tens of millions of workers. This can be seen from the recent panic situation.</p>
<h3>Selfish and Harmful</h3>
<p>Most Latin American countries have always sold their production abroad, with amounts ranging from 35% to 85%. From this, the indispensable nature of international trade can be seen even more. Britain must sell 25%, Germany, Canada, and Australia must each sell 30%, New Zealand must sell 40%, and Japan must also sell 45% to 65%. International transactions have now become the exception rather than the rule. All countries want to sell but not buy, all want to export but not import, and all want to exploit others and benefit themselves. The inevitable result of this contradictory behavior is that the prices of goods traded in the world market fall to the lowest level.</p>
<h3>Affecting Prices</h3>
<p>Its impact extends to the prices of various countries. Since the people of various countries are unable to transport their goods to pay for their differences, the structure of domestic finance is shaken, and currency exchange is also uncertain.</p>
<h3>Contradictory Behavior</h3>
<p>This kind of behavior, whether offensive or defensive, reduces the businesses of various countries to an artificial basis and forces the world into an economic war. Those who extremely advocate the harmful policies implemented after the war, based on a spirit of mistaken selfishness or unreasonable panic, consistently demand less economic contact with other countries. Their slogan is the so-called prosperity of charlatans, believing that national self-sufficiency can lead to wealth and strength, and that the people can eat well and dress warmly. As for the price level, they do not ask. When they formulate tax laws, they only focus on the protection of the domestic market, even to the extent of protecting inefficient or obviously uneconomical private businesses in inefficient industries. As for the way to circulate their excessive production through mutual exchange procedures, they do not consider it. The domestic market is out of touch with the world market, and price fluctuations are determined arbitrarily, and are also unrelated to the prices of other countries.</p>
<h3>International Cooperation</h3>
<p>But in today's world, isn't it time for governments to stop building tariff barriers and end their discriminatory and retaliatory behavior? It is true that knowledge has led people to recognize that countries are economically connected, sharing weal and woe. Therefore, as a result, international cooperation has become a fundamental necessity today.</p>
<h3>Key to Success</h3>
<p>Merely opposing selfish policies has failed to demonstrate its ability to avoid, prevent, or heal the most destructive withering of business history. Therefore, the conference must be able to stipulate a practical plan to deal with this difficulty. The beautiful conditions of peace, prosperity, and human progress lie in the maintenance of international commerce. The conference must clearly indicate whether civilized nations can ignore this economic fact and evade the responsibilities required by this fact. If all countries adopt a policy of gradually and cautiously adjusting excessive tax laws and other trade barriers to a moderate level, on the one hand, not allowing unreasonable or excessive foreign competition to disadvantage efficient industries in their normal state, and on the other hand, not exclusively enjoying the benefits of domestic prices, then the more stable and prosperous state of various efficient industries in all countries can certainly be guaranteed. This far-reaching program, which is neither extreme economic nationalism nor economic internationalism, can allow all countries to be in moderation, exchanging with each other to assist their efficient domestic markets with broad foreign markets. The world cannot continue to move forward in the way it is currently proceeding. The success of this conference is the key to the recovery of general trade.</p>
<h3>Breaking Isolation</h3>
<p>Public opinion has not yet fully understood the necessary procedures used to support international economic cooperation, but the people have suffered extremely, and public opinion will soon be aroused to assist this procedure. Countries disregard various realities and strive to pursue policies of economic isolation, each foolishly seeking a hermit's life without asking about the world. The idea that countries can extricate themselves through self-reliance, which is embraced by those who advocate economic isolation, has now been proven ineffective. A slight examination of the existing problems and the various situations and forces that have created the problems is enough to prove that this statement is not false. All countries have had panics, and those who advocate isolation view them as occasional events. Because in the view of those who advocate isolation, any panic does not have international characteristics, international causes, or international cures.</p>
<h3>Trade Principles</h3>
<p>Any country that wants to independently undertake a large reduction in national taxes or the elimination of transaction restrictions, or to consolidate its foreign exchange rates, or to restore international credit and commercial structures, will inevitably feel extremely difficult. I would like to restate a principle here: trade between countries is not about replacing a country's established domestic production and trade with the production and trade of other countries. International trade is mostly about the mutually beneficial exchange of surplus goods between various countries, directly or indirectly, and implies that enterprising countries enter the world to seek raw materials and manufacture goods. How can the current 30 million unemployed workers be restored to work, how can bankrupt agriculture be restored to stability, and how can withered industries be restored to normalcy? There is absolutely no other way. The world cannot continue to move forward in the way it is currently proceeding. Therefore, in my view, the success of the conference is the key to the recovery of general business. Although there is currently no fully understood public opinion to support the necessary procedures for world economic cooperation, I am certain that the losses and suffering suffered by the people of various countries have reached an extreme level, and soon public opinion will be aroused to actively assist this procedure.</p>
<h3>Making a Resolution</h3>
<p>The first and greatest task at present is to seek the development of the willingness and resolution of various countries to relieve suffering in this conference hall. After that, plans and methods can gradually take shape and become concrete. What I earnestly pray for is a spirit of cooperation, so that a unified guidance and procedure can be established in the conference, so that countless suffering people in the world can obtain hope. The initial step for the countries participating in the conference to show their sincerity is to immediately and universally abide by the tariff truce that more than a dozen countries have already complied with, and until the end of this conference.</p>
<h3>Jointly Planning Reconstruction</h3>
<p>A complete procedure should list one by one the methods and plans for international cooperation. All commercial obstacles should be removed, and all unfair trade methods and habits should be abolished. All countries should work on this at the same time, and adopt all effective methods that they can devise to deal with this difficult problem. In terms of the monetary scope, appropriate plans must be adopted in order to establish policies that can be implemented immediately, so as to provide the greatest possible stability to currencies during the period of seeking permanent improvements in the operation of basic work. At the same time, all countries must revitalize their natural resources and work to launch the wheels of industry and commerce, and cultivate the ability of consumers, so that prices can be raised.</p>
<h3>Willing to Contribute</h3>
<p>The US delegation is prepared to contribute concrete suggestions on the various issues mentioned above. All countries that have sent personnel to participate in the conference attach the greatest importance to peace and prosperity, and the necessary conditions for peace and prosperity lie in the appropriate reorganization of economic policies. Economic conflicts, with a few exceptions, are the most serious and permanent causes that endanger world peace.</p>
<h3>Committing to Peace</h3>
<p>Therefore, this conference has the great task of promoting and establishing economic peace, because economic peace is the foundation of all peace, and so on. When Hull spoke, the conference hall was extremely crowded. When his words were translated into French by the interpreter, most of the representatives who knew English retreated into the reception room to comment on the words of the US Secretary of State. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London Dispatch) At today's plenary session of the World Economic Conference, the attention of all representatives was focused on the speeches of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain and US Secretary of State Hull. The meeting opened in the afternoon. Hull left the meeting immediately after his speech. As a result, the seats of the US delegation in the hall were almost empty. British Prime Minister MacDonald also left the meeting, but returned to his seat not long after, while the Czech representative, Beneš, was giving a speech. Next, the Argentinian representative, Liibertón, briefly expressed the views of South America. Then, the Hungarian representative, Imrédy, described the views of Hungary, saying that Hungary's fall into its current difficult situation was due to the division of its territory after the Great War and the sharp fall in agricultural product prices. Hungary still needs foreign capital. Imrédy also mentioned that the total value of Hungarian exports in 1932 was insufficient to pay the amount required for debt repayment. Imrédy joined other representatives in strongly advocating that all obstacles arising from foreign exchange controls should be eliminated as soon as possible. Next, Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Colijn gave a speech, expressing doubts about whether the restoration of the gold standard was possible, and strongly urged that measures should be taken immediately to ensure that fluctuations in currency prices do not exceed the stipulated limits. Colijn endorsed Chamberlain's advocacy of abolishing shipping subsidies, and suggested that the principles contained in the newly concluded Belgian-Dutch commercial treaty should be adopted to seek trade growth. He also said that currency stability must be accompanied by the free flow of goods, otherwise the matter will inevitably fail, and so on. After Colijn finished his speech, the conference announced an adjournment until Thursday morning. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>War Debt Owed to America Due</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Announces to the House of Commons that America Accepts British Proposal</h3>
<p>Agrees to First Repay One-Tenth, $10 Million USD, Using Silver at a Price of 50 Cents per Ounce; Roosevelt's Reply States Unwillingness to Hinder the Progress of the Economic Conference; the Entire Debt Structure is Left for Future Resolution</p>
<h3>France, Belgium, and Poland Prepare to Default</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons tonight that President Roosevelt has accepted Britain's application to first repay $10 million USD of the war debt owed to America, which is due on June 15, using silver at a price of 50 cents per net ounce. The required silver has been purchased from the Indian government. Chamberlain went on to say that the British government had applied for a postponement of the payment of the amount due in June until the debt issue had been fully discussed, but the US President had not accepted it. However, President Roosevelt had accepted Britain's partial repayment of the debt with a spirit of cooperation, without impairing the freedom of the US government or future discussions. The reason for paying part of the amount due on June 15 was in the hope that this would lead to a solution to the problem before the next batch of debt becomes due. The Chancellor went on to say that since the Lausanne Agreement had caused countries indebted to Britain to stop paying their debts, it would be difficult for Britain to repay this huge debt in full. Therefore, if repayment were to be made again, it would invalidate the Lausanne Agreement, and the world, which had only been rescued last year, would once again fall into turbulence and despair. However, the British government certainly did not want to take any steps that contained a denial of its obligations. The Chancellor then read out the text of President Roosevelt's statement issued in Washington, stating that the formal application for the debt issue should be postponed to a later date. The business of the World Economic Conference must not be hindered by lengthy discussions about debt complications. Because Britain's application and this payment represent an acknowledgement of the debt, President Roosevelt specifically declared in his statement that he unhesitatingly stated that he did not regard the situation caused by this payment as a breach of obligation. The Chancellor concluded his speech by saying that the compromise between Britain and America on this matter was a good omen for the success of the World Economic Conference, and was the first step towards a complete and final resolution of the debt issue. Thereupon, loud cheers erupted from the four seats of the House of Commons. Subsequently, Cripps, representing the Labor Party, and Samuel, representing the Liberal Party, congratulated the Chancellor and expressed their deep admiration for President Roosevelt's views. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>White House Reply to Britain</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the US President has approved the holding of a special meeting, hoping to amend the entire British debt arrangement, and at this time to accept a portion of the amount due in June, without recognizing Britain as a defaulting country. In the official reply, the US President agreed to accept $10 million USD in silver at an agreed price of 50 cents per ounce, and stated that he had suggested that Britain could immediately seek to discuss the entire debt structure as soon as it was convenient, but that the period should be before the approaching December payment. He was willing to discuss the entire issue and submit the results to Congress for consideration, but also reiterated his opposition to discussing war debts at the World Economic Conference. The US President also stated in his reply that he was also well aware of the danger of full repayment mentioned by the British Foreign Office, acknowledging that world prices had plummeted after Britain's full repayment last December. According to what was said in the British Parliament, if the amount due in June was paid in full, prices would fall further, and that this repayment happened to coincide with the opening of the World Economic Conference, which could be said to be extremely unfortunate. Britain hoped that the concern that war debts would be difficult to resolve satisfactorily would not hinder the progress of the conference, and so on. The US President stated that he felt that promising to discuss the debt structure and submitting the results to Congress would create a better impression at the conference. As for the nature of the plan to resolve the war debt, neither the US reply nor the British dispatch indicated it. US Secretary of Commerce Roper said last night that the President would make a surprising new proposal. Today, Roper was unwilling to elaborate further, and the US President did not mention it, unless what he slightly surprised was referring to accepting a partial payment. It is expected that this kind of proposal will be expressed when the two sides start formal negotiations. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Delegation Satisfied</h3>
<p>(London) The US delegation to the World Economic Conference expressed satisfaction with the British government's decision to pay a batch of war debts, viewing this as a satisfactory resolution of the current difficult situation that had been harming international cooperation. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Silver to England</h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that the Indian government has remitted silver to the British government, worth approximately £1,600,000 British gold, to pay off part of its war debt to the United States. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Attitudes of Various Debtor Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has agreed to accept part of the British war debt repayment due in American dollars, amounting to $10 million. It is now believed that Italy will also repay part of its war debt tomorrow. Czechoslovakia and Romania will also follow Britain's example. However, Belgium and France will pay nothing. Although France has not yet made a statement, it is almost certain that it will not pay. Poland will also not pay, as declared by the Polish ambassador to the U.S. State Department. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Brussels) The Belgian government has notified the U.S. State Department that its attitude toward the war debt due on June 15th is the same as it adopted on December 15th of last year: willing to pay but unable to do so. It also stated that Belgium is sincere in seeking a satisfactory resolution to the war debt issue. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the war debt due tomorrow, the Finnish embassy in the United States has declared that it will pay the full amount, totaling $148,592. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Criticism from the American Opposition Party</h3>
<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Robinson stated today that the debts due should be paid in full or not at all. Robinson criticized President Roosevelt and the Senate for accepting Britain's application to pay $10 million in silver converted to American dollars as a first installment. Robinson also said that the same government, while seizing $400 million from American veterans, is accepting 10% of Britain's debt repayment. This is following the strategy of House, Morgan, and Wall Street. If President Roosevelt continues to trust Wall Street's words, that is all the repayment we will get from Britain. House, Morgan, and other organized wealthy nations all want to be relieved of European debts and have American taxpayers bear them. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Tensions in German-Austrian Relations</h3>
<p>Vienna, Reuters, 14th - Official sources declare that relations between Germany and Austria have become increasingly strained due to recent events. The riots in Vienna and elsewhere are attributed to the National Socialist Party, leading to the arrest of many National Socialists. Following the arrest of Hitler's representative, Habicht, in Linz, the head of the intelligence department of the German embassy in Vienna, Wasserbäck, was also reportedly arrested. This is widely seen as a retaliatory measure by the Germans for Habicht's arrest. Wasserbäck was subsequently released but forced to leave Austrian territory. According to official sources, before Wasserbäck's departure, he was forced to sign a document stating that his credentials had been revoked and that he had to leave the country immediately. The Austrian government considers Wasserbäck's treatment a violation of diplomatic privileges. Official circles here claim that the Habicht case cannot be compared to this, as Habicht has never been recognized by the Austrian government, while Wasserbäck is a formal member of the diplomatic corps. After being arrested in Linz, Habicht went on a hunger strike but was soon released and escorted to the border by Austrian police. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has appointed Wasserbäck as the head of the intelligence department of the Austrian embassy in London, with the rank of embassy secretary, ordering him to take up his post immediately.</p>
<p>Vienna, Reuters, 14th - According to official sources in Innsbruck, 120 National Socialist leaders have been arrested since the National Socialist Party plotted to assassinate the commander of the Tyrolean Home Guard, Wantl, on June 11th. The atmosphere in the city of Tyrol remains extremely tense.</p>
<p>Berlin, Havas, 15th - The Vienna "Mittags-Zeitung" reports that National Socialist Party troops have gathered at the border between Germany and Austria. This claim has been denied by the Kontinental-Korrespondenz. The semi-official Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau has also issued a statement saying that those at the German-Austrian border are not National Socialist Party troops but customs supplementary personnel. It stated that these officers only wear green customs armbands and do not have swastika armbands, which proves that they are not National Socialist troops.</p>
<p>London, National News Agency, 14th - Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss had originally planned to return to Austria by plane this afternoon, but he decided at the last minute to postpone his return to Vienna until Thursday. Dollfuss met with British Foreign Secretary Simon yesterday, and he is scheduled to meet with Baldwin on Thursday. It is said that the British government is very interested in mediating the various disputes between Germany and Austria and restoring diplomatic relations. However, the Austrian delegation strongly denies that Dollfuss requested British mediation, only admitting that relations between Germany and Austria have reached an extremely dangerous point, which was discussed in the talks between the British and Austrian representatives.</p>
<h3>Progress in Franco-Italian Relations</h3>
<p>Paris, National News Agency, 15th - Today's "Matin" confirms the rumor that French Premier Daladier intends to visit Rome in the near future to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is said that the French and Italian governments exchanged views when drafting the Four-Power Pact. Mussolini also expressed his desire for understanding between the two Latin nations in the Senate. Therefore, Daladier's trip is of great significance. It is expected that he will depart soon after the French Parliament approves the Four-Power Pact. It is rumored that Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, French Premier Daladier, and others will meet soon. Paris has denied this news. However, normally reliable sources report that a meeting between the three leaders is only a matter of time, as they all intend to meet to discuss matters after the establishment of the Four-Power Pact. Furthermore, there are still many outstanding issues between France and Italy that need to be resolved urgently, so they hope to meet with the leaders of other countries as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang in the Northwest Corner (4) Guo An</h3>
<p>(4) Feng Zhanhai, who always obeys the Central Government, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I braved the rain and stepped on the rotten mud, standing under the large bulletin board on the east side of the bridge, very carefully reading the proclamation of our Christian General assuming the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. I regret not having copied it down. The general idea was that China is now facing internal and external troubles, with mutual oppression. The enemy in eastern Hebei is inching forward. The only way out for China at present is to implement resistance against Japan. Therefore, the original text contained, "Yuxiang, as a soldier... Shanghai and Guangdong people..."</p>
<p>"Messengers frequently return... forced...". After reading the proclamation, I suddenly remembered what Zhang Jiurong, the representative, said, "Mr. Feng will definitely be supported by the people." I thought it was for this matter.</p>
<p>Events proved that the 26th was not necessarily for confiscating part of the weapons of the 63rd Army. It turned out to be the day when the Christian General assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Army. Therefore, the situation was so tense, and the incident came so abruptly. The tense atmosphere in Zhangjiakou finally slowly returned to normal at five o'clock in the afternoon. Our Christian General, on this day, marked the first step in anti-Japanese military force. Ji Hongchang leaped to become the garrison commander of Zhangjiakou. The provincial government and military police agencies were all taken over with guns. On the same day, special express and ordinary trains departing from Beiping were detained by Fang Zhenwu in Xuanhua. Simply and clearly, Zhangjiakou's transportation was cut off. Although the city's telephones were working, telegrams were still temporarily suspended. At this time, the most confusing thing for me was the attitude of Feng Zhanhai, the commander of the 63rd Army. At the same time, I didn't know whether this part of the troops had been disarmed by the Allied Army. So I called a rickshaw to No. 4, Second Alley, Lower Fort, the residence of Commander Feng, to inquire about what I was wondering about.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky had not yet cleared, and it already felt a bit dark after six o'clock. When I arrived at Commander Feng's residence, I asked the adjutant to deliver a card. It turned out that Mr. Zhang Jiurong had just received a mission from the commander-in-chief and was discussing matters with Commander Feng Zhanhai. I had no choice but to sit quietly in a small room and wait. The room next door was where the commander and Mr. Zhang were talking. Because they were talking very loudly, I could hear most of it. Moreover, Mr. Zhang Jiurong's loud voice was particularly amplified at this time. At the same time, the conversation was accompanied by laughter. This laughter belonged to Mr. Zhang alone, but this laughter contained a kind of victorious expression. Therefore, his unrestrained and galloping laughter echoed in this small courtyard. I listened quietly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Feng's actions this time were indeed prepared long ago..." (voice lowered) Immediately following was Commander Feng's very firm voice, "I am determined to resist Japan from beginning to end, and I am non-partisan." Hahaha... a burst of laughter came from Mr. Zhang. After laughing, he said, "That's right, you are resisting Japan from beginning to end. Mr. Feng, this is because of resisting Japan that you took this action. We are standing on the same front." Commander Feng paused for a long time and said, "Everyone knows about resisting Japan, but our 63rd Army is absolutely obedient to the Central Government." "Oh, Shoushan (Feng Zhanhai's courtesy name), why are you so vague..." (voice lowered again, vaguely hearing the words "Central Government...") At this time, there was a sudden silence for a long time. The scattered sound of rain and the evening wind collided. Thick smoke rose from the east wing. I slowly looked at the fire under the pit wall, while trying hard to listen with my ears. Suddenly, the laughter next door started again, but it was still Mr. Zhang's. It never elicited a response from Commander Feng Zhanhai. As the laughter faded, Commander Feng's voice came over, "I, surnamed Feng, fought from the Northeast to Rehe, leading tens of thousands of Northeastern sons and daughters, risking their lives against the Japanese. Now the Central Government has reorganized us into a formal army. How can I forget the enemy in my hometown and the treatment from the government? Therefore, I would rather preserve our glorious war history of resisting Japan in the past. Now, even if my head is cut off, it is not a pity." (Firm ending tone) At this time, there was silence again. I waited blankly for Mr. Zhang, but he didn't leave either. The sun had set in the dark clouds. If I lingered any longer, I wouldn't be able to get out of the Lower Fort gate. So I quickly left Commander Feng's residence in three steps and two steps. Outside the South Gate of Lower Fort, the muddy streets were crowded with a part of the 63rd Army's cavalry, as well as many large carts. Everyone was drenched in the rain and looked like bedraggled chickens. People were hungry, and there was no grass in the horse's feedbags. They were spinning around on the street, not knowing where to go. I spent a lot of effort to squeeze out of these people's and horses' feet. As soon as I crossed the bridge and saw the very end of these troops, there was still a team of armed soldiers from the Allied Army following. But those people's faces did not have any unusual expressions. It was getting dark. The rain clouds were pressing low on the earth. I returned to the inn, dreaming dreams that I myself did not understand. But the next day, the front of Commander Feng Zhanhai's residence already had Allied Army guards added. When I saw this reality, two large characters suddenly appeared before my eyes: "House Arrest." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japan's So-Called Continental Policy</h3>
<p>Preparing for a Second World War, will sacrifice China as its battlefield. First, establishing a national defense line on our territory. Japan has always taken an active approach towards China, with its so-called continental policy having a long history. However, Japan's continental policy, on the one hand, lies in seizing Manchuria and Mongolia, and on the other hand, it is directed at the whole world. Within it, there are strategies of opening and closing, each with its own stance, each with its own arguments. Fragments of information have already been scattered in various books. Now, we have obtained a systematic exposition from relevant parties, which we have specially organized and published. Readers, from this, may be able to grasp half of its meaning.</p>
<p>Originally, Japan, established on three islands, clearly knew that its population growth could not be accommodated, and its material resources were insufficient for self-sufficiency. Therefore, it had plans for colonization. However, Japan, established on military strength, especially knew that the three islands hanging over the ocean were vulnerable to attack from all sides. Therefore, it had to be prepared for war on all sides at any time. The necessary conditions for war, in addition to the navy and army, especially emphasized the supply of war materials and the provision of food. Japan, in its small area, could not bear this burden. It also knew this. Unable to be self-sufficient, it was inevitable to seek resources from abroad. Therefore, Japan's active pursuit of its continental policy is better described as preparation for a world war than simply as colonization.</p>
<p>In terms of preparing for a major war, the most important issues are the national defense line and combat plans. Japan, facing this situation, knew that it could not escape war. It especially knew that the trend of the world powers posed a danger of combined attacks. Therefore, its planned were prepared on all sides, just like Germany in the European War, fighting alone against the Allied forces. Everyone knew that fighting alone against the Allied forces was not easy. Moreover, Japan, as an island nation suspended in the ocean, would it not instantly become scorched earth if it used this corner of land to resist attacks from all sides by sea, land, and air? Therefore, Japanese military planners necessarily included China in their plans. Because in its wartime arrangements, in addition to seeking large quantities of resources and raw materials from the three northeastern provinces, it would also sacrifice China as its battlefield.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of fighting alone against the Allied forces, if America comes from the east, Japan will inevitably resist it at sea. It will also use the islands in the Pacific Ocean that can be used as bases as the foundation for its foothold. If England comes from both oceans, since Singapore already has a military port and Hong Kong is also its territory, Japan will inevitably contend with it in the oceans of both parts of China. However, the strength of the British is great, and its influence extends to the Yangtze River basin, making it not easy to oppose. Therefore, its strategy against England must be to let it penetrate deeply and attack it, so that it can detach from its usual sphere of influence and be easily intercepted. The most suitable location for this is the great plain between the Huai River and the Yellow River. This is its strategy of using the Chinese map as a battlefield.</p>
<p>The resources of the three northeastern provinces have long been coveted by the Japanese, and it is necessary to use them as wartime raw materials and food, as mentioned earlier. However, Japan's relationship with the three northeastern provinces is not limited to resources. It also wants to establish the eastern provinces as its national defense line. If the idea of the Allied forces unfortunately becomes a reality, how could any country not join? In the north, it soothes its back, seizing the treasures of its resources, and is also worried about advancing into Korea, endangering its mainland. Therefore, its attention to national defense in the three northeastern provinces may surpass its attention to resources. Moreover, in recent years, the Greater Khingan Range and the Duhe River area have been completed with their defense formula in the forest. Setting up pastures and defenses has not been a matter of a single day. The forest area of the Zhamian Company loses money every year. The General Staff Headquarters provides secret funds to maintain it, costing several million yuan a year. Facilities are also added within this forest that covers the sky. Furthermore, plainclothes troops are deployed among them. Anyone who goes there is killed under the guise of bandits. Therefore, no one can pry into its secrets. The national defense line and national defense facilities of a country are placed in a neighboring country and are not known to the neighboring country. Then Japan's military plans can be said to be the ultimate in mystery. Before the September 18th Incident, there was the so-called Nakamura assassination incident. Nakamura was dispatched to Xing'an Mountains to investigate and was killed on the way. The Japanese took this as an excuse for their actions.</p>
<p>Once Japan's national policy is determined, everything is carried out according to this national policy. All political and diplomatic activities are carried out along this path. Only by understanding Japan's national policy can one speak of China's response. China has no national policy to speak of. However, should not even this temporary diplomatic policy be decided after knowing the enemy and oneself? Those in our country who are responsible for diplomacy should carefully consider the line of action against Japan and the position in the international arena. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Relocation of the Mongolian Anti-Japanese Army to Guyuan</h3>
<p>Urzintai Sternly Rejects the Japanese Temptation. Mongolian Brave Warriors Enlist Voluntarily Along the Way to Kill the Enemy. According to a special dispatch from Beiping, the Mongolian Anti-Japanese Army fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Yibaijiazi and then relocated to Guyuan. A Mongolian named Magula came to Beiping from Guyuan. This reporter visited him and asked about the experiences of the Mongolian army in resisting Japan. According to his answer, the fall of the Northeast endangered the whole country, and Mongolia was the first to bear the brunt, facing a situation of great uncertainty. At this time, there was a Mongolian named Urzintai, the Duke of Zhenguo of the Zhuo League, who was 25 years old. He graduated from the Northeast Military Academy. Seeing the Japanese disregard for justice and endless encroachment, he rose up in anger, contacted Mongolian people, and organized the Mongolian Cavalry Self-Defense Army, numbering about 2,400 people. Just as things were getting ready, Chifeng was reported to have fallen. Urzintai believed that the time to resist Japan had come, so he personally led his troops to guard Xiaoliangzi, Niutougoumen, and Gongyefu (this place is the thoroughfare of Chihe), preparing to resist. Unexpectedly, Chengde also fell one after another, so the front and rear were surrounded by the enemy and fell into desperation. The Japanese knew that this part of the force was not easy to eliminate, so they sent people four times, promising various benefits, to persuade them to surrender. Urzintai sternly rejected them all and gave a speech to his troops, saying that he would rather be a ghost on the battlefield than a slave to a fallen country. His troops all understood the righteousness, so they independently guarded Xiaoliangzi, Niutougoumen, and Gongyefu for five days. They came into contact with the Japanese army several times, and due to the terrain, they were still victorious. However, in the end, they were suppressed by airplanes, tanks, and artillery, so they had to break through the encirclement and retreat westward. The people in the places passed by by this unit all welcomed them with gratitude, because this unit (1) had strict discipline, (2) did not have the disturbances of defeated soldiers and bandits in the places they arrived, and (3) the soldiers were able to endure hardship and were not willing to disturb the people's houses even if they were exposed to the elements and lacked food. Therefore, when they retreated westward, hundreds of people from the local area voluntarily followed them. On the way to Fengning, they encountered the Japanese army in Yibaijiazi. More than ten people from this unit died, and more than ten were injured. More than forty people were killed or injured on the enemy side. They have now relocated to Guyuan, and the number of people has increased to more than 3,000, all of whom are Mongolian brave warriors, skilled in riding and shooting. They only feel the suffering of lacking ammunition and food. If material assistance is given to increase the morale of this unit, it will be of great benefit to resisting foreign aggression, saving the country, and consolidating the border. It is heard that the Mongolian Border Stabilization and National Salvation Association, knowing that these thousands of brave warriors are seeking survival for the country and fighting for the glory of the nation, deeply admire them and have decided to send people to comfort them recently and request assistance from all parties. (Jin, 14th)</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Conference</h3>
<p>There Will Be New Developments in Bandit Suppression Military Affairs. According to a dispatch from Nanchang, the Nanchang Bandit Suppression Conference was held at a time of military tension. Senior officers of all troops had to command defenses and operations. Except for those who were specially summoned or had important official business to come to the province, such as Chen Jicheng, Sun Lianzhong, Li Yunjie, Li Yunheng, and Luo Lin, the rest were deputy army commanders, division commanders, chiefs of staff, or staff directors. Therefore, this conference can also be said to be a staff conference. It opened at the headquarters at 8:00 am on the 8th. Attendees included Li Shangyong, the representative of the Eighth Route Army from Guangdong, Zhang Chi, the representative of Yu Hanmou, Wang Xiuyun, the representative of the 24th Army from Sichuan, the Deputy Director of Security from Anhui Province, and one to three people from each of the independent brigades and above in the bandit suppression units of eastern Hunan, southern Hubei, and the whole of Jiangxi. At least 50 divisions from various provinces participated. Hundreds of proposals and reports were received, mostly reports, because bandit suppression is different from fighting against regular troops. It is difficult to win with military theory and new tactics. Only with experience can one be victorious. On the opening day, after Chiang's instructions, the attendees reported in turn on the bandit situation in their respective defense zones, the course of the battles, the reasons for the failures, the facts of the victories, and the experiences they had gained, one by one. Chairman Chiang also narrated the experiences he had gained in various bandit suppression campaigns, verifying each other. After each report was completed, it was immediately criticized and instructed. From the 9th to the 11th, the discussions included (1) the combat plan and liaison methods proposed by the First Department of the headquarters. This case was extremely important. Chairman Chiang, He Guoguang, Xiong Shihui, and Mao Bingwen all expressed their opinions. The army and division commanders also used their combat experiences to illustrate the effective strategies, analyzing them in detail and researching them for three or four hours. As a result, the amended version was passed. (2) Staff affairs proposed by Xiong Shihui, Director of the Office. After Xiong explained the original plan, the participating chiefs of staff and staff directors researched each other. Finally, Chiang added a conclusion, focusing on concentrating talented people and researching Western military staff plans to improve the army's combat skills and chances of winning. (3) The improvement of the intelligence organization and reconnaissance plan proposed by Yan Xunfu of the Second Department. After Director Yan and Secretary Deng of the headquarters reported on the various measures, the participating officers, such as the Deputy Division Commander of the Sixth Division, added their experiences. Chiang was satisfied and instructed the various departments to do as he said. The responsibility for espionage was borne by the staff officers of each army, division, and brigade. (4) The training and education of the troops proposed by Liu Xing, Director of the Third Department. The discussion resulted in a focus on spiritual unity, rectifying military discipline and morale, and officers and soldiers sharing hardships together. (5) The post-war party and government plans for the bandit areas proposed by the Fourth Department. There were very detailed laws on civilian self-defense, gathering refugees, rescuing the wounded, collecting the remnants, restoring vitality, clarifying the source of bandits, and restoring the countryside, so that the party, government, and military would work together, which is the method of three-tenths military and seven-tenths politics. The remaining proposals were either merged, cancelled, or used as reference, which cannot be listed exhaustively. It is also heard that this conference focused on the experiences gained by each person in fighting bandits, exchanging opinions with each other. Chiang selected the effective and realistic ones and made them into proposals for implementation, which is absolutely not comparable to those who talk idly on paper.</p>
<p>Now, the various discussions have been completed. The closing ceremony was held at 8:00 am on the 12th. Chiang reiterated the points that were not completed in the fourth meeting, such as the elements of soldiers, the organization of the army, and the tasks of the staff, and explained them in detail. He also gave detailed instructions on the essentials of marching, camping, and fighting, and described in detail the experiences he had gained in managing the army and fighting during his tenure as staff officer, army commander, commander-in-chief, and chairman of the committee, from beginning to end, to serve as a standard. Finally, he earnestly exhorted the generals to abide by the various instructions and resolutions and to do them conscientiously, without being superficially compliant. In the future, the results of bandit suppression will be based on this as an assessment, and the ability to implement this resolution will be the standard for rewards and punishments. The conference closed today (12th), and the generals will return to their defenses one after another starting tomorrow (12th).</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Debate in the Jiang Song-Zhao Lianbao Case</h3>
<p>The County Court heard the case of Zhao Lianbao's self-accusation of Ni Fengchi's obscenity at 10:00 am today (15th). After two hearings, the trials were continued because the witnesses did not arrive. The people crowded around the trial because Ni was accused of adultery with his servant. Judge Zhang presided over the court. The plaintiff, Zhao Lianbao, hired former Yuan lawyers Wu Luping and the defendant, Ni Fengchi, appeared in court with lawyer Lu Baixiang. The questioning officer began by questioning the plaintiff about the reasons for the lawsuit, saying that she was hired to serve but did not know she was to be a concubine. She was seduced midway and eventually abandoned. The marriage certificate presented by the defendant did not mention this. The defendant argued that she was purchased with money and denied the master-servant relationship. He also filed a counterclaim, accusing the plaintiff of absconding with property. The court then ordered the debate to begin. The lawyers on both sides debated fiercely for about half an hour before the court ordered the debate to end and set the date for sentencing on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Gun Execution of Suzhou Bandit Huang Zhengqing</h3>
<p>On the morning of November 9th, after the Tungshan class Yutai ferry and water police patrol boat were robbed by bandits, the captured bandit Huang Guangheng confessed to gathering a gang to rob the ferry, seize weapons, and injure the police. He also admitted to kidnapping people with surnames such as Pan and Kong for ransom in Huanliang Port, Beiku, and Hengjing in Wujiang, between August and October. Yesterday (the 15th) at 2 PM, the Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters, following orders, had the bandit tied and taken to Wangshu Mound to be executed by firing squad. Before his execution, he confessed that his real name was Huang Zhengqing, and requested that a letter be sent to his brother Huang Zhengwan in Puan Mountain, Hongxing Bridge, Changxing, Zhejiang, to come to Suzhou to collect his body.</p>
<h3>Urgent Dispatch of Aircraft Purchase Donations</h3>
<p>The county government, together with various agencies and local figures, organized a committee to raise funds for the purchase of aircraft. Over 9,000 silver dollars have already been raised. Yesterday, the county government received a provincial order requiring that the collected donations be sent to the province within three days. County Magistrate Zou convened a committee meeting yesterday (the 15th) and resolved to conclude the matter by the end of June. The raised donations will be managed by a local organization, and will be handed over to the designated foreign firm when the provincial government purchases the aircraft, in accordance with the government's mandate that the funds not be used for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Rapid Resolution of Robbery by Bandits in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Around midnight on the 14th, the home of You A'da, a villager in Ye'anli, Tanqiao, in the sixth district of Wuxi County, was suddenly entered by four robbers speaking with a Jiangbei Changzhou accent. Each was armed with a handgun and broke in through the door. The You family members were awakened from their dreams and attempted to flee, but the robbers went straight into the inner room, intimidated them into silence, and ransacked the place. They stole a suitcase containing many clothes and personal items, and also used a carrying pole to injure the head of Huang, the wife of the homeowner You A'da. After obtaining their loot, the robbers, not yet satisfied, went to rob the neighboring Wang Pan'da's house. At that time, You A'da's father, Tinggen, seeing that the robbers had left, climbed onto the roof and beat a gong to alert the authorities. The robbers, realizing that they had been discovered, fled the scene. However, this morning (the 15th), You A'da unexpectedly ran into the robbers from the night before at the Xicheng Road intersection, carrying the stolen goods. You immediately followed them and reported to the police in Jiangyin Lane. The police apprehended the robbers and the stolen goods on the spot and took them to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After preliminary interrogation by Bureau Chief Ji, the suspect, claiming to be Zhang A'er, was evasive about the robbery of You A'da's home. Bureau Chief Ji, seeing that the stolen goods had been recovered, did not allow him to continue his prevarications and ordered him to be detained temporarily, pending submission to the County Public Security Bureau for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Resolve to Increase Wages</h3>
<p>After years of losses, silk factories in Wuxi all but ceased operations. Wages had been reduced from 57 cents to 45 cents, and the factories were still struggling to stay afloat. Workers, however, were dissatisfied because the factories had not only reduced wages but also arbitrarily extended working hours. A major labor dispute erupted last winter. Provincial officials He Yushu and Li Mingyang, along with Provincial Party Committee member Zhang Gongren, came to Wuxi to mediate and arranged for three measures to improve worker treatment. Regarding wages, a daily rate of 43 cents and a piece rate of at least 33 cents were set, and both labor and management have adhered to these terms to this day. This year’s spring silkworm harvest has been excellent, and the silk market is gradually improving, so the factories are planning to resume operations, either by reorganizing existing factories or by attracting new investment and changing brands. Over the past two weeks, there has been a lively atmosphere. However, the majority of female workers have dispersed, either seeking other work, so the factories require skilled workers and are experiencing a labor shortage, so many have increased wages to attract workers. The Silk Factory Trade Association, concerned that varying treatment would easily lead to labor disputes, urgently needed to develop a sound cooperative approach. Yesterday, they convened all members to discuss and resolve to improve treatment and increase wages to ensure uniformity.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Adulterous Couple Conspire to Murder Lover</h3>
<p>Zhang Aoda, a farmer from Xiaozhangjia Village outside the East Gate of Wuyi, had once taken a Gu woman from outside the North Gate as a child bride, but they never married, and Zhang died of illness. Subsequently, the Gu woman became involved with a wounded soldier named Hu Dengsan and had a child with him. However, Hu had no steady job, and the family's livelihood was not secure. The Gu woman secretly became involved with another wounded soldier named Ye Jincai, abandoning the old and embracing the new, viewing Hu Dengsan as a thorn in her side. Recently, she conspired with Ye Jincai to assassinate him. Ye enlisted friends Zhang Guiting, Zhao Songlin, and Zhou Dacai to go to Xiaozhangjia Village at night, seize Hu Dengsan, first injure him with wooden sticks, then kill him with a kitchen knife. They put a burlap sack over his head, tightly bound his hands with straw rope, and buried his body in the mulberry garden behind the inner residence near the government office. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, accomplice Zhao Songlin was quietly praying to Buddha in the wounded soldier ward of Tianning Temple when he was questioned by an official and revealed the entire truth. As the case involved murder, a team was dispatched to arrest Ye Jincai and the other three accomplices. That night, the landlady Zou Right and her family members were arrested from Gu's residence, and the adulterous woman Gu was arrested in Dongqing. After interrogation on the 14th, the adulterous woman and others were sent to the county government, while Zou and others were placed in the custody of the nearby public security sub-station. The station's patrol officer, Zhuang Duanping, immediately reported to the County Court Prosecutor's Office to send someone to exhume the body for examination. Prosecutor Tang led officials to the scene and exhumed the body from the mud. The examination confirmed that the victim had been repeatedly and severely cut in the throat, leading to death. The prosecutor ordered that the body be re-coffined and buried, and ordered the arrest and interrogation of the main perpetrators and witnesses for legal action.</p>

<h3>Students Forced to Return from Japan</h3>
<p>A group of seventeen arrived in Shanghai yesterday, planning to host Chinese and foreign journalists to report on the details of their persecution in Japan, according to Central News Agency. Seventeen Chinese students studying in Japan, including Xi Minglun, Qi Xianzhang, Wang Chengmo, Zhang Guangren, Xu Wenshou, etc., were forced to board the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru and arrived in Shanghai at 5:30 PM yesterday. After disembarking, they each sought accommodation. The details of their persecution and arrival in Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<h3>Strict Search by Japanese Agents</h3>
<p>When the Nagasaki Maru docked at the Huishan Wharf, a large number of Japanese agents boarded the ship and searched the returning students with extraordinary severity. As the students disembarked and moved their luggage, the Japanese agents were still watching, as if Huishan Wharf were not in Chinese territory but in Tokyo. Therefore, when reporters asked the returning students for information, they were all constrained by various factors and did not utter a word. Even the list of returning students was not fully disclosed, indicating the situation at the time.</p>
<p>(Photo by Xu Tianzhang) Students expelled from Japan return home</p>
<h3>Details of Persecution</h3>
<p>A returning student, taking advantage of an opportunity, told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the seventeen of them boarded the Nagasaki Maru in two groups on the night of the 13th and left Japan to return home. After arriving in Shanghai, they recalled the persecution they had suffered in Japan, which filled them with grief and indignation. Before the September 18th Incident, there were a total of about 8,000 students studying in Japan. Subsequently, they gradually returned home, so there are now only about 1,000 left in Japan. Although we were in a foreign country, under the oppression of imperialism, we never forgot for a moment the Japanese army's invasion of our homeland, the brutal killing of our compatriots, and the destruction of cities. Seeing the widespread suffering of refugees in our country, we organized a refugee relief association to collect funds and send them back to our homeland, doing our duty as citizens. Unexpectedly, this aroused the jealousy of the Japanese authorities, who, starting on March 15th, secretly dispatched detectives to arrest us from our residences. To the best of my knowledge, more than forty people have been arrested, but because they were living in different locations, it was impossible to find out the exact number. After we were arrested, we were detained in police stations and subjected to severe beatings. Some even died from their injuries. It is reported that one student had his sternum broken and has been sent to the judicial authorities. After we were released, we went to our embassy for assistance, but after repeated negotiations, there were no results. We had no choice but to return home with regret. It is said that there are more than thirty students who will return on the next ship.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, there were originally twenty-two students expelled and returning home. There were still five people staying in Kobe, who had to wait until today to board the Hakone Maru and arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Yesterday, a total of seventeen people arrived, including Xu Wenshou (Industrial University), Miao Jingqing (Normal University), Guan Zhongzhe (Industrial University), Song Mingping (Meiji), Huang Zhongming (Meiji), Jin Lixian (unknown), Hu Zucheng (unknown), Zhou Ying (Waseda University), Nie Yige (research), Wang Chengmo (Medical College), Wang Jingyan (Meiji), Zhang Jichang (Normal University), Zhang Guangren (Keio), etc. They departed from Kobe on the 13th. Due to encountering fog en route, they arrived at the port as late as 5:10 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>To Report to the Press</h3>
<p>The returning students, because of their hasty arrival in Shanghai yesterday, did not have time to detail their experience of persecution. Fearing that this may cause concern for Chinese and foreign figures, they plan to invite Chinese and foreign journalists in the coming days to give a detailed report.</p>
<h3>Jiang Feng Aircraft Departs Yesterday</h3>

Due to slight damage to the aircraft parts, they are waiting for technicians dispatched by the Aircraft Manufacturing Plant to come and repair them before continuing west.</p>
<h3>Bad Weather</h3>
<p>Director Zeng Yijing originally planned to have the pilot, Mr. Purvis, fly the self-made Jiang Feng aircraft to depart at 7:00 AM, but due to fog and low air pressure, he had to wait for the China National Aviation Corporation to report the weather conditions from various locations before deciding on a plan. It was not until 8:00 AM that a report was received stating that there was fog along the Yangtze River, from Jiujiang downwards, at an altitude of over 500 feet, making it impossible to fly. Director Zeng, with everything prepared, decided to fly through the fog.</p>
<h3>Departure Through the Fog</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the Jiang Feng seaplane was floated on the river surface from the Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Gaochang Temple. Director Zeng and Mr. Purvis both changed into flight suits and boarded the Jiang Feng aircraft, bringing with them ten boxes of engine oil, totaling fifty gallons, fifty copies of the Far East Monthly Report, as well as ordinary clothing and spare parts for repairs. At 9:15 AM, the aircraft, piloted by Mr. Purvis, departed. The Union Film Company filmed the event.</p>

<p>The Jiang Feng aircraft has 165 horsepower, a maximum speed of 110 miles per hour, a normal speed of 85 miles per hour, a payload of 800 pounds, can seat two people, and has an endurance of six hours. The fuselage is silver-gray, and the tail is painted with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth national emblem.

<p>All circles are very impressed by Zeng's flight across the country in a self-made aircraft. The local Aviation Association and others are preparing to hold a welcoming ceremony after the flight to Fujian and Zhejiang returns to Shanghai, and public organizations are also planning to participate in the welcome. President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan telegraphed Zeng yesterday to congratulate him, saying: "To Director Zeng Yijing of the Jiang Feng seaplane, Hankou Telegraph Bureau: I read in the newspaper that you are flying the self-made aircraft to Jianghan this morning. I sincerely wish you success. Yu Youren, sincerely." Director He Zhuoxian and all the staff of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry also sent a telegram congratulating Zeng on his departure, saying in the original telegram: "To Director Zeng Ningyu of the Jiang Feng seaplane, Hankou Telegraph Bureau: Brother, your flight across Jianghan in the self-made aircraft allows the public to deeply recognize their duties, a contribution to aviation. We send our congratulations by telegram and wish you success. Trademark Bureau Director He Zhuo and all the bureau staff, sincerely."</p>
<h3>Machine Damage Stops at Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>It was originally planned that the Jiang Feng would land in Nantong to refuel. However, it was learned from a telegram earlier that the six boxes of engine oil, totaling thirty gallons, to be transported to Nantong would not arrive in Nantong until yesterday afternoon. The plane passed by Nantong in the morning, so the plan was temporarily abandoned. By 10:30 AM, it had arrived in Zhenjiang. It was originally planned to stay for one hour, then fly to Nanjing, and after lunch, fly to Wuhu and Anqing, and arrive in Jiujiang that night. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Plant received a long-distance phone call from Director Zeng in Zhenjiang reporting that the aircraft had landed in Zhenjiang because the steering lever at the engine had been damaged, and repairs were temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Personnel for Urgent Repairs</h3>
<p>Before the departure of the Jiang Feng, spare parts and equipment were carried. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Plant specially dispatched technician Wang Chonghong, leading four aircraft mechanics, with equipment, to Zhenjiang on the 11:45 PM night express train to make repairs. It is expected that the repairs will be completed by 8:00 AM this morning.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Celebrates Successful Eurasia Test Flight</h3>
<p>Dozens of leaders from the transportation industry attend, General Manager Li Jingcong gives a speech. Because the Eurasia Aviation Corporation had ordered two new Junkers W-34 aircraft from Germany, which flew directly from Berlin to Shanghai, and the flight was successful, a celebration was held at the Dadong Restaurant on the evening of the 14th at 7:00 PM. Those who attended included leaders from the transportation industry in Shanghai, Director General Huang Naishu of the Postal Administration, Director General Tang Baoshu of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Director Wen Yuqing of the International Telegraph Bureau, Director Rong Baoli of the Telegraph Bureau, Director Xu Xueyu of the Telephone Bureau, General Manager Liu Hongsheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Director Zhu Yaoyan of the Maritime Administration, General Manager Dai Enji of the China National Aviation Corporation, German Consul General in Shanghai Moore, Chairman Huang Jiangquan of the corporation, Chinese directors Liu Shifang and Chen Qijun, German directors Bo Lusen, Fu Kai'er, Fan Xike, and various secretaries and chiefs of various groups, dozens of people in all. General Manager Li Jingcong of the corporation stood up to give a speech, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<h3>World Aviation Sets New Record</h3>
<p>Honored guests, anyone who has read the account of travels in the Chinese hinterland by the Swede Sven Hedin cannot but sigh at the difficulty of traveling in the Chinese interior, as difficult as ascending to heaven. Furthermore, the Great Wall of China, built in ancient times to defend against foreign invasions and to restrict Sino-foreign communication, stretches across the northern border, making a journey over this unique, most magnificent, and most mysterious structure impossible except for those who can ascend to heaven. Only ignorant and unknowing birds can come and go freely. The Chinese people have neither restricted nor hated the comings and goings of birds on this vast land. Time flies, and in this 20th century, an Eurasia Aviation airplane has flown from Berlin, through Russia, across the remote northwest region of China, to various ports in the southeast. From now on, all humans will have the opportunity to travel to the Chinese interior by plane. Not only will birds be amazed, but the Great Wall will also lose its effectiveness. The success of our company's direct Eurasia test flight is a major revolution in the history of Chinese transportation and a new record in the world of aviation. The pilots, Boerte and Luz, and their accompanying telecommunications mechanic were able to fulfill our company's mission of a Eurasia test flight on this trip, promoting the spirit of the German nation, which is even more worthy of our admiration.</p>
<h3>Vertical and Horizontal Flights in the Chinese Interior</h3>
<p>China's maritime ban has been lifted for many years. However, given China's vast territory, people living in remote areas of the interior are accustomed to the old ways of not interacting with each other and have never heard of the outside world. Since we have been engaged in the Eurasia aviation business, we have flown as far north as Manchouli, and test flights south to Hunan and Guangdong. As for the northwest region, we have entered Xinjiang via Gansu and Liangzhou. We know the most about this kind of closed-door governance in the Chinese interior. However, since the completion of the Eurasia aviation business, we believe that the Chinese interior, which previously had no interaction with the world, will have a new outlook, and the saying that "China is part of the world" will once again become a reality. Furthermore, China's position in the world will become more important. A country's transportation is like the blood vessels of a body. We know that to be healthy, one must first ensure that the blood vessels are flowing smoothly. If we can establish a well-organized transportation system within the country, the country will inevitably become rich and strong day by day. Therefore, we deeply hope that once Eurasia aviation is directly connected, China's national pulse will be circulated, and China's economy will be developed. The indirect benefits to the world's economic life will be even more immeasurable.</p>
<h3>East and West Soar Hand in Hand</h3>
<p>Furthermore, after Eurasia is connected, not only will those places in the Chinese interior where there is well water to drink be able to import Western material civilization, but the cultures of Europe and Asia will also be able to achieve a wonderful effect of mutual adjustment and mutual breeding. The significance of Eurasia's connection is as described above. We are celebrating the success of this direct Eurasia test flight tonight. However, when drinking water, we must remember its source. When celebrating the success of the Eurasia test flight, we cannot but think of Mr. Shimidt, who died in Germany while preparing for the Eurasia flight. Mr. Shimidt is unable to join us at this celebration. I believe that all of you here will feel sad about this. However, we believe that Mr. Shimidt's spirit in heaven must be looking down on us, guiding us to complete his hopes and striving for his unfinished work. Furthermore, we believe that Mr. Shimidt's soul was the guide for this plane's flight east, and that we will recite the German poet's line, "East and West, soar hand in hand," to encourage us to move forward. With this meaning, we respectfully wish the personnel of the successful Eurasia test flight good health.</p>
<h3>Guest Speakers Praise Success</h3>
<p>Following Li's speech, Mr. Walter, director of the company's flight operations group, expressed satisfaction to the company's pilots and extended his condolences. Secretary General Lin Wo Jiang of the China Aviation Association congratulated the company on its smooth future. German Consul in Shanghai, Bai Liante, praised the achievements of General Manager Li Jingcong of the company in managing Eurasia aviation. Finally, the pilot of this successful test flight, Boerte, gave a speech of thanks. The guests and hosts dispersed after 11:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Northwest Route Resumes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Eurasia One, Xinguomin News Agency reports that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, due to the disturbances in Xinjiang, temporarily suspended the Northwest route. Now that Special Envoy Huang Musong has arrived in Dihua and the rebellion is irrepressible, the first aircraft (the W-34 modified) departed from Hongqiao Airport at 9:00 AM yesterday to fly to Xinjiang. The pilot was German, and there were two passengers and a large amount of mail on board. According to General Manager Li Jingcong of the company, the company hopes to reach its destination on this trip, but if the unrest is still not pacified, it will only go as far as Suzhou. Also, the second German aircraft that arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday was inspected at the airport yesterday, and has been designated as Eurasia Number Two, joining the Northwest route. Currently, the company has a total of six aircraft, and one more has been ordered from Germany, which will arrive in Shanghai next month and be designated as Eurasia Number Three. Because the previous three aircraft had all been destroyed, they are now being replenished.</p>
<h3>Italian Military Aircraft Purchased Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that there is an Italian aircraft currently being assembled at a local airfield. It is said that this type of aircraft is one of the fastest military pursuit aircraft in the world, having won the top two prizes in the 1932 Zachuk International Flying Competition for speed. It was recently purchased by the Chinese government from the Italian Fiat company. Lieutenant Cresti, the Italian Fiat company's flight director, brought the aircraft and arrived in Shanghai on Monday. After assembly is complete, he will fly the aircraft for several demonstrations.</p>
<h3>Tianchu Aircraft to Arrive in Shanghai on the 18th</h3>
<p>The Daily News reports that Wu YunChu, the manager of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory in the city, donated 100,000 yuan to order an aircraft from the famous American plant, Christie's company, and it has already been shipped from the United States to China. It should arrive in Shanghai on the 18th of this month, and a naming ceremony is planned to be held at Hongqiao Airport on the 20th. As for the other five aircraft purchased by the public, they should also arrive within the month.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Hosts Banquet for Russian Ambassador</h3>
<p>Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov, since taking office in China, has shown considerable amity in his dealings with the Chinese authorities. Mayor Wu, to promote friendly relations, hosted a banquet at his official residence last night, and invited the charges d'affaires of Poland and Chile to attend as escorts. In addition, Counselor Milikowski of the Russian Embassy and Russian Consul Osaning and Affairs Director Angaski were also invited, as well as Yu Hongjun, Guo Dehua, Xu Jianping, Tang Shixuan, etc. The atmosphere was very pleasant during the dinner.</p>

<h3>Consolidation of Postal Foundation Case Completely Resolved</h3>
<p>The Postal Research Association unanimously passed a resolution at yesterday's meeting that the committee members would continue to be responsible for supervising the implementation, according to the Central News Agency. The Postal Economic System Research Committee held its eighth meeting at the Municipal Government at 4:00 PM yesterday, and unanimously passed the "Proposed Outline for the Implementation of the Consolidation of Postal Foundation Plan," requesting that it be submitted to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the Ministry of Communications for implementation. The Postal Economic System Research Committee was also declared closed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Research Process</h3>
<p>On May 19th of last year, the storm over the consolidation of the postal foundation erupted, with postal workers in Shanghai first announcing a strike, which then affected the entire country. Leaders from all circles in Shanghai, seeing the seriousness of the situation, came forward to mediate. On the 26th of that month, a plan was signed, and the Executive Yuan hired Mayor Wu and others to form the Postal Economic System Research Committee to submit the consolidation of the postal foundation plan to the committee to research implementation methods. After a year of research, Lin Kanghou and Pan Gongzhan were appointed, together with expert committee member Wang Wenwei, to formulate a plan that did not violate the principles of consolidating the postal foundation, accommodating the opinions of both the Ministry of Communications and the postal workers. After repeated exchanges of views, both sides were able to overcome their prejudices, and the seventh meeting was convened on the 10th of last month to make a final decision. Unexpectedly, the meeting lasted for three days, and disputes arose over the personnel and evaluation issues of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, which could not be completely resolved. After exchanging views and mediating repeatedly, the views of both sides began to converge, and the eighth meeting was convened yesterday to propose the key points of the consolidation of the postal foundation plan. The consolidation of the postal foundation issue, which had been delayed for more than a year, was thus concluded.</p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Those who attended the meeting yesterday included committee members Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Gongquan, Pan Gongzhan, Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, Huang Naishu, Tang Baoshu, and others, a total of nine people; expert committee members Wang Wenwei, Shen Yiyang, Lou Zuyi, Lin Zou, Li Gan, Jing Runshi, and others, a total of six people; postal worker representatives Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Zhao Shusheng, Ge Fei, Shi Yitang, Kang Yong, Qi Jiamou, Zhang Kechang, Lu Keming, Zhu Jingsheng, Yin Ruli, and others, a total of eleven people. The meeting was chaired by Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around four o'clock, the meeting was declared open. First, the chairman recited the "Proposal for the Implementation Outline of the Foundation Consolidation Plan for the Postal Service." After minor modifications to a few words, it was unanimously approved by the entire assembly. Then, representatives of postal workers stood up and declared that after the adoption of this Implementation Outline of the Foundation Consolidation Plan for the Postal Service, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau must not hire new personnel. The chairman agreed on the spot and required Mr. Tang Baoshu, Director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, to express his acceptance. The chairman did not deliver a speech until about six forty-five, when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Original Text of the Proposal</h3>
<p>The Proposal for the Implementation Outline of the Foundation Consolidation Plan for the Postal Service, which was passed yesterday, has already been submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions to the Ministry of Transportation for implementation. The original text reads: (1) Introduction: Since the wave of the foundation consolidation movement occurred last May, it has affected the whole country. All sectors in Shanghai, in view of the seriousness of the situation, have exerted great efforts to mediate. After signing the plan on May 26th, the Executive Yuan appointed Tiecheng et al. to organize the Postal Economic System Research Committee, and submitted the foundation consolidation plan for the postal service to the committee. Based on the rules and research implementation methods, after a long period of research and multiple meetings, the committee formulated the implementation outline. It strives not to violate the principles, to adopt the opinions of the Ministry and the workers as much as possible, and to refer to the reports of specialized commissioners, considering both facts and theories, with the aim of making it practical, sustainable, and achieving the effect of consolidating the foundation of the postal service. (2)</p>
<p>Regarding the postal savings and remittance sector, (A) Regarding the issue of merging the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau: 1. The existing Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau will be renamed the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, directly under the Postal General Bureau. 2. After the reorganization of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, it should earnestly implement retrenchment within the possible scope to save expenses. 3. The Ministry of Transportation should consider the local situation and the operating conditions of each Savings and Remittance Branch over the years to decide on the merger of each branch. (Attachment) The existing Savings and Remittance Branches will be merged within at most half a month after this Implementation Outline is submitted to the Executive Yuan and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for approval. (B) Regarding the issue of accounting independence: 1. At present, the postal service's financial situation is suffering significant monthly losses. For the sake of consolidating the foundation, 70% of the revenue from monthly remittance services will be allocated to the postal service to cover the expenses incurred by postal bureaus in various regions due to savings and remittance services, with the remaining 30% going to the Savings and Remittance Bureau. However, remittance losses will also be shared by the General Bureau and the Savings and Remittance Bureau in a 7:3 ratio at the end of the year. As for the annual settlement, if the Savings and Remittance Bureau still has a surplus after deducting its expenses for the year, 30% will be used as the Savings and Remittance Bureau's public reserve fund, and 70% will be allocated to the General Bureau, according to the current method of distributing the surplus of the Savings and Remittance Bureau. 2. The Savings and Remittance Bureau will specially set up a record of all income and expenses related to savings and remittance services, and report it to the General Bureau monthly. At the end of each fiscal year, it will be compiled and submitted to the General Bureau and included in the postal accounting report. 3. All funds for remittance receipts and payments throughout the year will be managed and allocated by the Savings and Remittance Bureau. (C) Regarding the issue of the Supervisory Committee: 1. Regarding the organization of the Supervisory Committee, in addition to representatives from the public opinion organs, the Supervisory and Auditing Office, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Postal General Bureau, the Ministry of Transportation will also consider and select representatives from several important industrial, commercial, and financial organizations with outstanding reputations. Several people will be selected by the Ministry to jointly organize it. (Attachment) The minutes of the talk show meeting of this committee on March 24th of this year should be attached and submitted to the Executive Yuan. This committee will consult with the Ministry of Transportation to select two representatives from the postal worker organizations to participate as members of the Supervisory Committee. 2. The powers of the Supervisory Committee will be stipulated separately. (D) Regarding the issue of the candidates for Director and below: 1. The Director and Deputy Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau should be specialized personnel with knowledge and experience in the financial industry, or postal personnel with such knowledge and experience. 2. The heads of each department should be specialized personnel with experience or postal personnel. The deputy heads and below should be postal personnel. 3. Other existing staff below the deputy head level, except those who are transferred from postal personnel, must be screened before they can be employed. (Attachment) The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau's employees other than postal personnel are appointed by the Director of the Postal General Bureau, and the Director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau must conduct strict screening before they can be employed. (E) Regarding the assessment of savings and remittance personnel and all administrative issues: (1) The appointment, dismissal, salary, assessment, rewards, punishments, promotions, retirement, pension, bereavement benefits, and all other matters related to the personnel serving in the Savings and Remittance Bureau should be handled in accordance with the current postal regulations. (2) In order to promote and develop the savings and remittance business, subjects such as silver remittance and economics should be added to the postal recruitment examinations in the future. (3) Regarding the aviation subsidy, the airline is a new transportation construction, and the postal service should support its development if there is a surplus. However, the postal service is currently in financial difficulty and is unable to provide subsidies. The possibility of assistance will be considered after the postal service's financial situation improves, and it will be treated as a loan. (4) Regarding the payment to the Ministry, the postal service will no longer increase the current management fee in the postal service's period of financial difficulty. When the financial situation improves in the future, after deducting operating expenses and capital expenditures from the operating revenue, the necessary funds for the development of the postal service should still be retained. If there is a net surplus, 50% should be set aside as a reserve, and the rest should be paid to the Ministry. (Attachment) According to this Implementation Outline, the payment to the Ministry should be based on the current amount (90,000 yuan per month), with half borne by the Postal General Bureau and half by the Savings and Remittance Bureau.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Wu Tiecheng said in his speech yesterday, "This committee has been established for one year and twenty days. It is jointly organized by local people and government officials, and has worker representatives attending and specialized commissioners helping with the research. This committee is directly and indirectly working hard for the future of the postal service, and all parties are hoping that the foundation consolidation of the postal service will have satisfactory results. Fortunately, all members have spared no time and effort to research and collect opinions in detail. The Ministry and worker representatives have been able to resolve prejudices, work together harmoniously, and solve the long-delayed problem of consolidating the foundation of the postal service satisfactorily. This committee can also declare its end, and I am very pleased. From now on, all members should continue to uphold the spirit of the past and be responsible for supervising the government's implementation," and so on.</p>

<h3>Today is the Birthday of the King of Sweden</h3>
<p>Swedish Community Celebrates. Today is the seventy-fifth birthday of King Gustaf V of Sweden. Mr. Lin Kuishi, the Swedish Consul-General and Acting Minister in this city, will receive congratulations at the Cathay Hotel from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Swedish merchants in this city will also close their businesses to hold a lively celebration. Since Sweden became an autonomous country, its king has strived to maintain international peace externally and has focused on people's livelihood internally. Even during the fierce European war, Sweden was able to maintain neutrality and stay out of the conflict. Therefore, the country is prosperous and the people are at peace, and the political situation is stable. In recent years, the impact of economic recession has been relatively light. Even the bankruptcy of the Kreuger company was able to avoid a major financial crisis. Therefore, the people's love and respect for the king is deeper than in other countries.</p>

<h3>Domestic Goods Factory Association Sends Letter Inviting Participation in the Capital National Exhibition</h3>
<p>Letter to All Factories</p>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Factory Joint Association yesterday sent letters to all factories, inviting them to participate in the Capital National Goods Exhibition. The letter reads: "Dear Sirs, We have received a letter from the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, stating that the Fourth Annual National Goods Exhibition will be held and will open on June 20th. They requested us to collect exhibits, etc. We have sent a letter to all national goods manufacturers, encouraging them to participate actively.

They have submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to postpone the opening date to July 10th. The exhibition period will still be one month. They hope that we will widely collect the high-quality products of all factories and open a temporary exhibition market in the hall, also hoping to collect from all factories and merchants to participate enthusiastically, set up shops for sale, so as to expand publicity and promote sales. As for the collection of various exhibits and the registration of various manufacturers, please ask your association to handle them publicly for the sake of simplicity.

The exhibition period will be extended to the opening on July 10th. In addition to the Shanghai-Hangzhou manufacturers who are currently participating in the National Exhibition in Ningbo, we hope that all national goods manufacturers will actively participate to help the grand event. The exhibition period will still be one month. The booth fee is 35 yuan per booth. The tax exemption certificate and fee reduction form will be issued at the due date, etc. The Capital National Goods Exhibition is led by the Ministry of Industry and is a major national goods saving movement.

We also hope that you will register at the meeting as soon as possible. Do not fail to meet our expectations."</p>
<h3>[Pseeks Solution to Labour Dispute at the New Factory &gt;</h3>
<p>Workers at the Sino-French New Shipbuilding Factory in the South City, protesting against the beating of Chinese workers by foreigners, triggered a work slowdown. The Social Affairs Bureau dispatched Wang Keqing, director of the mediation section, to mediate yesterday morning. It was agreed by both labor and management to resolve the issue. The injured worker was given 100 yuan for medical expenses and two weeks of leave. Workers were to be paid half of their wages for the period of the slowdown. All workers returned to work at the factory at 1 p.m.</p>
<h3>Anhui Official Discusses New Measures for Governing Anhui Province</h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the Anhui Provincial Government, it has been quite active in clarifying the historical administration and revitalizing the general administration. A reporter from the Shen Shi News met with a certain senior official of the Anhui Provincial Government who had just arrived in Shanghai from Anqing yesterday and asked about the recent situation. According to him, since Liu Zhenhua was ordered to take charge of Anhui, he has been seeking reform and advocating openness in personnel and administration. He has established a Qualification Review Committee for Government Affairs Officers and a Local Government Affairs Research Association to seek the selection of true talent and strict training. Recently, in the past, county magistrates and public security chiefs often used the excuse of going to the province to present important official matters and left their posts without waiting for approval, resulting in a lack of responsible persons in the locality and many mistakes. Strict orders have been issued to all counties that from now on, they should prioritize their duties. If there are important official matters, they can be telegraphed. Even if there are matters that must be presented in person, they must wait for the approval of the provincial department before they can depart. Otherwise, they will be immediately dismissed.</p>
<h3>Stocking Needles Worth 2,000 Yuan Nearly Stolen</h3>
<p>Song Yunqing, a native of Ningbo, recently established a Jiangxin Stocking Needle Factory at No. 4, Jiajiawan, Longhua, producing a large quantity of needles every day. Around 8 p.m. last night, a thief broke into the warehouse and stole three large packages of needles worth more than 2,000 yuan. Fortunately, an apprentice saw him and caught him on the spot with the stolen goods. He immediately reported to the police and sent the thief to the Third Precinct of the Sixth District. According to his confession, his name is San Younian, he is 30 years old, and he is from Cixi. He also confessed to having an accomplice on the run named Zheng Chengqing. The chief filed a report to the judicial section for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Overturned Kerosene Lamp Burns Down Twenty Thatched Houses</h3>
<p>Fire at Zhang Zhushan's Home in Caojiadu</p>
<p>At 3:15 a.m. yesterday morning, at No. 5, Xin Street, west of the Caojiadu Sixth Precinct Police Station, the home of Zhang Zhushan, a native of Yancheng, Jiangbei, caught fire due to inadvertently overturning a kerosene lamp, causing a sudden fire. Thick smoke immediately filled the air and burst through the roof. Fortunately, the Sixth District was nearby, and Precinct Chief Tan dispatched police to telegraph various fire brigades, while immediately dispatching the entire shift of patrolmen to the scene to rescue and suppress the fire. In a short while, the Caojiadu, Jing'an Temple, Zhabei, and other fire brigades rushed to the scene in their vehicles. However, because the thatched sheds were easy to burn, the fire had spread to the left and right, and the fire was very fierce. After the firefighters worked hard to put out the fire, it was extinguished after about half an hour. A total of twenty thatched houses were burned down. When the fire first started, the women, children, and elderly in the thatched houses were awakened from their sleep, and their cries and shouts shook the vicinity. The scene of supporting the old and carrying the young was extremely tragic. The firefighters and patrolmen worked hard to maintain order and rescue the victims, so that they were not injured. Then, Precinct Chief Tan dispatched police to investigate the cause of the fire and took Zhang Fushan's wife, Qian Wei, into custody for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Greek Trafficker in Opium Arrested Confesses to Tianjin Theft Case</h3>
<p>Greek national Seditis, German national Roland Sheng, and Italian national Medeng were caught trafficking in opium by Chief Inspector Liu Shaokui and Sergeant Song Bingzheng of the Inspectorate General of Customs. Medeng was sent to the Italian Consulate for interrogation, and the other two were sent to the First Special District Local Court for custody and investigation, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide proposed to continue the trial and found the facts to be true. He then sentenced Seditis to one year and six months in prison and a fine of 200 yuan, and Roland Sheng to eight months in prison and a fine of 60 yuan. However, Seditis had previously colluded with a Russian named Duma Rufu in Tianjin to steal photographic equipment from the Lihe Foreign Firm in Tianjin. After the case was discovered, he fled to Shanghai. After Seditis was arrested for trafficking in opium, he confessed to the theft case. As a result, Duma Rufu was also arrested by the police. Yesterday morning, after the opium trafficking case was judged, the police lawyer, Ru Baogong, immediately stated in court that he requested that Seditis's execution be suspended until documents arrive from Tianjin so that he and Duma Rufu can be sent to Tianjin for punishment. Judge Feng granted his request.</p>
<h3>Support the Anti-Contracting Movement at the Maigen Road Station</h3>
<p>Declaration by the North Station Loading and Unloading Branch</p>
<p>The Shanghai North Station Loading and Unloading Branch of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Union, directly under the Ministry of Railways, declares in support of the anti-contracting movement at the Maigen Road Station: "To all party and government agencies, people's organizations, and colleagues on the two railways: We, the loading and unloading workers of the two railways, have long suffered from contractors. The sweat and blood of thousands of people fill the bottomless pit of a few. Oppression and exploitation are deeply rooted in our skin. Work progresses and retreats according to their whims. Even now, thinking about it makes us pale with fear. Our workers feel insecure about their own survival. Inspired by the tide of the National Revolution and led by the Chinese Nationalist Party, we launched a movement to abolish the contracting system. After the transfer of political power to party rule, workers were liberated. Loading and unloading workers at all stations of the two railways were able to obtain the fruits of their labor without having to worry about the erosion of evil forces. The party advocated it, the government implemented it, and it was made into a political program and promulgated as a law. Our workers were celebrating the party and government rule, recuperating and recuperating, alleviating pain, seeking to increase production, and hoping to maintain welfare forever. However, things did not go as expected. On the 7th of this month, the two railway administrations suddenly used force to forcibly abolish the Maigen Road Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative and restore the contracting system. The reasons were roughly divided into two major points: one was that the worker leaders could not manage the workers, and the other was that the workers' loading and unloading was not good, resulting in a decrease in freight. This kind of action, which imposes a big hat, can be understood if it comes from a private enterprise with labor-management relations, but it is actually done by the railway authorities, which directly forgets its position and responsibilities. Railway workers are national personnel. If improvements or reorganizations are needed, they are allowed by the state's governance. Why must we resort to contractors to drive them to desperation? Contractors are like fish in a cauldron today, and workers who have already been abolished will resist firmly as long as they have a breath. The anti-contracting movement of the loading and unloading workers at the Maigen Road Station is not only a matter for the 769 people at the Maigen Road Station. All loading and unloading workers on our two railways share the responsibility. Our colleagues at this station will provide spiritual and material assistance to the workers at the Maigen Road Station for this kind of retrograde, anti-Party program measure. Any reason given by the railway bureau is not sufficient to constitute the basis for restoring the contracting system. We will definitely oppose it to the death and will not stop until the goal is achieved. We hereby declare."</p>

<h3>Letter from Tenants in Dafang Lane Requesting Rent Increase Cessation</h3>
<p>The landlord of Dafang Lane in South Chengdu Road, who owns numerous properties around Chengdu Road, Weihaiwei Road, etc., has recently used the excuse of increased water rates to notify the tenants of Dafang Lane, through the Dafang Company’s management department, that rents will be increased by over 30% starting in June. According to the lease agreement, those who do not agree will be ordered to move out. Upon hearing this news, the general tenant population is extremely indignant. They believe that these houses were built less than three years ago. During this time of national crisis, these capitalists, without considering the plight of ordinary people, have rashly proposed a rent increase, which is a form of oppression and disrupts social order. The tenants have already united to establish a temporary office and have sent letters to the Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations, appealing for help to stop this increase. It is unknown whether this can be resolved peacefully.</p>
<h3>Reporting Loss of Badge</h3>
<p>Hu Wencai, the household registration police chief of the First Precinct of the Seventh District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, lost a "421" badge while on a trip to the countryside to check household registrations. Fearing that it might fall into the hands of criminals, he has reported this to his superiors. The badge should be considered invalid if found in the future.</p>

<h3>Assassination of Inspector Ma Shaowu of the Municipal Police Bureau</h3>
<p>Attacked by Assassins after Attending a Dinner Party; Four Shots Hit Vital Areas; Rescuers Unable to Save Him. At 7:30 PM the night before last, an assassination occurred at the back entrance of the Dongfang Hotel on Xiaohuayuan Alley, Zhejiang Road. Upon the incident, this newspaper's reporter rushed to investigate. However, as it was not yet time for publication, it was not reported. The details are now provided below.</p>
<h3>The Background of Ma Shaowu</h3>
<p>Ma Shaowu was from Jiangyin, 32 years old, and served as a special inspector for the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. He lived at No. 8 Honglai Fang, Shangwen Road, in the South District, with his wife, Ms. Xu, and had one son and one daughter. His mission was to investigate subversive organizations and he was known for being very capable and courageous. Recently, important subversive figures such as Chen Guang, Luo Dengxian, and Yu Wenhua were all arrested by Ma. Therefore, Ma hired a bodyguard and carried a pistol for self-defense.</p>
<h3>Dinner Party at Tianxin’s Brothel</h3>
<p>At 7:00 PM the night before last, Ma had an appointment for a dinner party at the home of a prostitute named Tianxin in Xiaohuayuan. Around 7:00 PM, he left home alone in a private car and went to Zhejiang Road, stopping at the entrance of Alley 229 (i.e., the main alley of Xiaohuayuan). Ma was wearing a light gray suit, a white straw hat with a silver aviation patriotic badge pinned to the brim. After the car stopped, Ma got out and gave two silver dollars to the driver, Zhu Shaoxiang, a native of Yangzhou, telling him to go have dinner and come back later. Zhu then drove away.</p>
<h3>Ambush in the Alley</h3>
<p>At the same time, Ma walked into the main alley of Xiaohuayuan. Unexpectedly, as he walked to the back entrance of the Dongfang Hotel, three assassins suddenly jumped out of the darkness, blocking his path. The assassins then each pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at Ma. Realizing the danger, Ma, though seriously wounded, retreated and pulled out his own pistol to fire back. However, the assassins fired two more shots, one hitting Ma’s lower jaw. Ma fell to the ground without being able to retaliate, bleeding profusely. Seeing that their mission was accomplished, the assassins scattered and fled. Shopkeepers and employees of the clothing store and jewelry store at the entrance of the alley heard the shots and rushed out, finding Ma lying in a pool of blood. They immediately ran out to call for help.</p>
<h3>Four Shots All Hit Vital Areas</h3>
<p>A patrolman from Post No. 328 nearby heard the alarm and rushed into the alley with his gun drawn, but the perpetrators had already fled far away. He immediately telegraphed the Zhabei Police Station, and Detective Robert led a team of detectives in a patrol car to the scene. At the same time, Ma's driver, Zhu Shaoxiang, heard about the assassination in Xiaohuayuan while at a restaurant and rushed to see what had happened. He found his employer lying on the ground. Sensing that Ma still had a breath, the detectives rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was discovered that there were four wounds in total: one bullet entered from the left eye and exited at the right neck, one bullet entered from the root of the right ear and exited at the left neck, one bullet passed through the lower jaw, and one bullet entered from the front chest and exited at the left waist.</p>
<h3>Alias Discovered After Death</h3>
<p>The hospital doctors tried their best to treat him, but he died at 8:15 PM due to excessive blood loss. The hospital reported this to the police station and a hearse took the body to the coroner's office. At the same time, the driver rushed to report to the Municipal Police Bureau. Ma had 68 silver dollars, three gun licenses, a bunch of keys, and a stack of business cards of Lu Keqin, an inspector of the Municipal Police Bureau. After the incident, outsiders only knew that the murdered person was Lu Keqin. After extensive inquiries by reporters, it was discovered that the victim's real name was Ma Shaowu. He had changed his name to facilitate his work.</p>
<h3>Post-Incident Investigation</h3>
<p>After the incident, the police sent detectives out to hunt down the perpetrators. As of last night, they have made no progress. The police reported Ma's body to the court for an autopsy yesterday morning. Prosecutor Zhang Junqing was assigned by the First Special Court to inspect the body at the coroner's office. The body was identified, and the prosecutor ascended to his official seat. Report No. 328 from the Chinese police stated that upon hearing the gunshots, they rushed to the scene of the incident, but the perpetrators had already fled and could not be apprehended. The car driver, Zhu Shaoxiang, stated that after arriving at Xiaohuayuan, his employer gave him silver dollars and told him to go eat, so he did not see the faces of the assassins. Ma's wife, Ms. Ma Xu, then filed a claim requesting to claim the body. Prosecutor Zhang verified the statements and ordered that Ma Shaowu, also known as Lu Keqin, had died from gunshot wounds, and that his wife, Ms. Ma Xu, should take the body back for burial. It is reported that the family has moved the body to the Wan Guo Funeral Parlor for embalming.</p>
<h3>Opening of Chengzhong Medical Academy</h3>
<p>First established a Tuberculosis Sanatorium Department, rushing to renovate the Psychiatric and General Departments, expanding the buildings. Zhongshan Hospital can begin construction this autumn. The Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan, with its peaceful scenery and fresh air, has been generously donated in its entirety by the garden owner, Mr. Ye Ziheng, to the National Shanghai Medical College to be converted into the Chengzhong Hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis and mental illnesses. It officially opened yesterday. The Daily News reporter drove to visit yesterday to explore the details, which are as follows:</p>
<h3>Generous Donation of Garden Property</h3>
<p>The Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan is the legacy of the late Mr. Cai Chengzhong, a wealthy man in Shanghai, and is managed by his son, Mr. Ye Ziheng. The interior garden and scenery are very beautiful. The garden's construction is only fifteen years old. Mr. Ye believed that the garden was suitable for treating illnesses. Due to his friendship with Dr. Yan Fuqing, president of the National Shanghai Medical College, he generously donated the entire property to the college this spring to be converted into a hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis and mental illnesses, named Chengzhong Hospital in memory of Mr. Ye Chengzhong. It officially opened yesterday. The Chengzhong Hospital plaque was written by the philanthropist Wang Yiting and was hung up at 4 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Internal Equipment</h3>
<p>After the reporter arrived at the Ye Family Garden, the hospital's president, Yan Fuqing, and doctors Hua Chongen led the way to see the hospital. The hospital is divided into three major parts: a tuberculosis sanatorium, a psychiatric sanatorium, and a general sanatorium. Currently, the tuberculosis department has been established and houses are being actively renovated to be used as sanatorium rooms, which are uniquely beautiful. The medical and pharmaceutical equipment includes X-ray machines, sun lamps, air injectors, and other modern medical equipment. The X-ray machine donated by the Rockefeller Foundation, worth 13,000 yuan, is expected to arrive in Shanghai in three months. The two air injectors newly ordered from Austria are also expected to arrive in Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<h3>Separate Sanatorium Rooms</h3>
<p>The sanatorium rooms in the tuberculosis department are divided into first, second, and third class. There are seven first-class sanatorium rooms, each accommodating one tuberculosis patient. The daily fee for each person ranges from 10 yuan, 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and 4 yuan, etc. The 10 yuan rate is available to both men and women. The 6 yuan and 5 yuan rates are limited to men, and the 4 yuan rate is limited to women. If a companion is hired, an additional 1.5 yuan per day will be charged. There are two second-class sanatorium rooms, accommodating both male and female patients, with three people per room. The fee is 2 yuan per person per day. There are two large third-class sanatorium rooms, limited to men, with five to six people per room. The fee is 5 jiao per person per day. In total, the hospital can accommodate more than forty patients. Medical and pharmaceutical expenses are included. If special medicines are needed or artificial pneumothorax is performed, an additional fee will be charged. The tuberculosis patients admitted to the hospital are limited to those seeking a sanatorium, but regardless of the severity of the tuberculosis, they must first be diagnosed and treated at the Red Cross Hospital before being transferred to the sanatorium.</p>
<h3>Medical Staff</h3>
<p>The president of the hospital is Dr. Yan Fuqing, president of the National Shanghai Medical College and director of the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross. The resident doctor is Niu Huilin, and the diagnosing physicians are Liu Deqi and Bu Mei, who visit to diagnose patients once every other day. The head of general affairs is Pan Jingfu. There are more than ten nurses.</p>
<h3>Yan’s Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Dr. Yan Fuqing, president of the hospital, when speaking to the Daily News reporter yesterday, he said that Mr. Ye Ziheng's donation of the garden, valued at more than 2 million yuan and covering more than 70 mu, to be converted into a hospital is admirable. He will do his best to preside over the project and make it the most fully equipped natural sanatorium in Shanghai. The existing houses will be temporarily used as temporary tuberculosis sanatoriums. This autumn, construction will begin on a new-style tuberculosis sanatorium department, and a psychiatric department will also be built to accommodate mental patients. The addresses are all in the vicinity of the garden. The monthly cost of managing the garden is 800 yuan, and the cost of medicine and other expenses is 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Currently, the National Shanghai Medical College is responsible. In the future, it is planned to organize a board of directors to raise large sums of money. As for the baseball field of the Ro Shenfu Road Association for the Advancement of Physical Education, donated by the Rockefeller Foundation and covering 137 mu, the official letter from Rockefeller has not yet been received, but it is expected that construction can begin this autumn as the largest-scale Zhongshan Hospital.</p>
<h3>A Woman's Deep Affection Results in Death</h3>
<p>The husband took an excessive amount of sleeping pills; the wife, thinking he was beyond saving, committed suicide by poison to follow him. Alas, the husband woke up, but the wife was beyond saving.</p>
<p>Zhao Caiji from Ningbo was only 24 years old, while his wife, Ms. Dai, was two years older. They lived together at No. 1640 Jing'an Temple Road in Western Shanghai. The couple had a very close relationship, living together in harmony and never quarreling. They already had four children, the oldest just reaching childhood and the youngest still in infancy. Zhao also had an elderly mother who enjoyed her grandchildren, and the family was relatively well-off, so they were able to live in harmony and have enough to eat and wear. However, Zhao was physically weak and had also suffered from insomnia recently. During long nights, he often could not sleep all night, so he bought sleeping pills. Whenever the illness occurred, he would take one or two pills, which were quite effective. But one night, Zhao could not fall asleep for a long time, so he took the medicine. Unexpectedly, after taking one or two pills, sleep would not come. He increased the dose by several pills. Although he immediately fell into a deep sleep, he was still not awake by the next morning. Ms. Dai called him frequently, but he did not respond, and pushing him, he did not wake up. She was greatly shocked and cried, thinking that her husband had taken an excessive amount of medicine and could not be saved. She then had the idea of dying together with him. She took the opium paste that her husband had left over from his previous smoking and sat alone in front of the bed, sadly drinking it. Zhao, who was having a nightmare, caught a glimpse of his beloved wife with tears on her face and realized she had drunk poison. He was extremely shocked and did not know what to do. By the time he got up to snatch it away, a cup of opium paste had already been poured into her stomach. He hurriedly asked her why she had taken the poison, only to find out that it was due to a misunderstanding. He immediately took her to the hospital in his own car. Unexpectedly, the poison had entered her organs and could not be saved. She died at 11 AM the day before yesterday. Zhao heard the news and mourned deeply, saying, "Bo Ren died because of me." The Jing'an Temple Police Station, which was in charge of the area, dispatched detectives to investigate the cause of death based on the hospital's report and took the body to the Fei Lun Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, a report was filed with the First Special District District Court's Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Zhang came to the office, examined the body, and took his official seat. After questioning Zhao, he ordered him to sign a statement to claim the body for burial. Ms. Dai can truly be said to be deeply in love.</p>
<h3>A Beggar Boy Tears off Scrotum by Biting</h3>
<p>Su Dahai, in Private with his Brother Yang Fujin, Furious and Commits Murder. At 8:30 PM yesterday, the upstairs of the Laoximen Small Vegetable Market was where a group of child beggars lived, making a living by begging. A child beggar, Su Dahai, 14 years old, from Xuzhou, and his younger brother, Su Xiaohai, 12 years old, both begged for food. They were especially pitied by people, often getting white rice, which was coveted by Yang Fujin, 15 years old, a local child beggar of the same kind. He repeatedly tried to snatch the white rice from the Su Dahai brothers, but the Su Dahai brothers worked together and Yang could not succeed. Yang then hated Su to the bone and had tried to pick a fight several times, but failed. Yesterday morning, Su Dahai again obtained a can of white rice and carried it back, intending to eat it with his brother. Yang Fujin strongly wanted to snatch the rice in Su Dahai's can to eat it together, but he did not succeed. Yang then took brick chips and threw them into Su's rice can, causing a fight between the two sides. Unexpectedly, Yang Fujin, who had accumulated resentment, suddenly put his head under Su Dahai's pants and bit Su's scrotum with all his might. He pulled hard, causing half of Su Dahai's scrotum to fall off. Su Dahai fainted from the pain, and blood gushed out. A neighboring beggar reported to police officer Xiao Jielu of Post No. 26 of the First Branch of the Second District, who arrived and arrested the child beggar Yang Fujin who committed the assault, along with the injured Su Dahai, and took them to the police station. After Chief Shen examined Su Dahai's half scrotum, he found that only the skin was connected, and the situation was very dangerous. He immediately sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. When questioned, the defendant Yang Fujin denied biting and only said that he had punched during the fight and was kicked by Su Xiaohai. As the evidence was conclusive, he was sentenced and sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Work of the Sino-Japanese Trade Research Institute</h3>
<p>｜Editor: Sino-Japanese Trade Statistics｜</p>
<p>The Chinese Economic Society established the Sino-Japanese Trade Research Institute in May of last year, with Cai Zhengya as the director. Over the past year, it has compiled a book, Sino-Japanese Trade Statistics, which is based on the official customs records of our country and the statistics published by the Japanese ministry, excerpted, compiled, and cross-verified. The research explores in detail the ebb and flow of trade between various countries and China, recent trends, the classification of import and export goods, the increase or decrease in the quantity and value of major imports and exports, the impact of the Liaoning Incident on Sino-Japanese trade, and seasonal variation indices. Statistics are the most boring and difficult to understand, so the book uses tables to explain them clearly, diagrams to make them easier to understand, and words to synthesize their arguments, with annotations to support their evidence, and a summary at the beginning. Therefore, even if one does not have time to read it completely, one can get a general idea by briefly reviewing it. The book has 348 pages, including 30 diagrams, 32 tables, and 9 appendix tables. It is published by the China Book Company and will be released next month.</p>
<h3>Barbers Discuss How to Negotiate the Gao Case</h3>
<p>Urging the Authorities to Lodge a Protest and Requesting Du Gong to Mediate. The Shanghai Barber Industry Committee to Clear the Grievances of the Gao Yatouzi Tragedy continued its twelfth plenary executive committee meeting at the Barber Association in Tongde Lane, Xieqiao, South City, at 10 AM yesterday. Fourteen people attended. Chen Sijiang was elected chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by a discussion of the following matters: (1) Committee member Qian Shouling proposed that since the Gao case occurred, the committee had already reported the situation to the Party and government agencies, requesting a protest and dispatching personnel to petition. However, for a month, the authorities have not made a single statement, which is very suspicious. The committee should continue to urge the authorities to lodge a protest. It was then decided to elect Yang Jinxi, Luo Shantao, Qian Shouling, and Wei Guoyi as representatives to go to the Municipal Government again to petition on a fixed date and demand a definitive reply. (2) Guan Zhihe, Luo Shantao, and others proposed that the committee had previously sent representatives to petition Chairman Du of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, who had allowed for mediation. However, the victim's father is hoping for an early resolution of the case. Should the committee send representatives to Chairman Du again to request him to mediate? It was decided to elect Qian Shouling to accompany the previous representatives Luo, Wei, and Guan to request Chairman Du at his residence on a fixed date. (3) The chairman reported that fellow industry members have been writing letters of reprimand, as the Gao case has not been resolved for a long time, unaware of the difficulties in the negotiations and unclear about the truth. He proposed publishing a special issue to reprint news about the Gao case negotiations and report on the income and expenditure. The committee unanimously approved, but the name of the publication needs to be solicited from all parties and decided at the next meeting. (4) The chairman reported that the Municipal Party Headquarters is urging the committee to submit a formal reorganization as an industry association, requesting the appointment of seven people as representatives to submit to the superior authorities for legal reorganization, so as to receive legal protection. At that time, a labor representative raised an objection, saying that the committee is a group that promotes labor-capital cooperation and deals with foreign affairs, but now that capital has a formal association organization and labor cannot participate, it is unfair and may prevent cooperation in the future. It was decided that the association and labor union should be prepared at the same time, and if the labor side is not allowed, the capital side will also stop. This was deemed satisfactory. (5) Guo Wanhai reported that the Yangzhou Hometown Association held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided to convene a joint meeting of various hometown associations and lawyers next Saturday to discuss concrete measures for the Gao case negotiations. Should the committee send representatives to participate? Rong Guangren and others seconded the motion. It was decided that all committee members could participate freely to facilitate cooperation. Finally, the chairman reported a summary of the third income and expenditure accounts. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Third Day of Trial for the Xin Renhe Steamer Tragedy</h3>
<p>｜Debates Continue Today｜ Both sides' lawyers attack and defend. The prosecutor claims premeditated murder. The trial of the Xin Renhe steamer tragedy continued at the District Court at 10 AM yesterday. Again.</p>
<h3>Questioning Sun Xingsheng about the Contract</h3>
<p>When was it signed? Answer: It was signed in the first month, but those who were not present at the time signed it in the second month. The workers on the ship's bow belonged to me, and those in the accounting room and the fire cabin signed another part of the contract. Question: Does increasing wages require a meeting? Answer: No, it's just a gathering. Question:</p>
<h3>How Can We Share Happiness?</h3>
<p>Share Misfortune? Answer: It means that if wages are increased, then we share happiness, and if business is suspended and wages cannot be increased, then naturally we must share misfortune. At this point, the plaintiffs stated that they had unanimously dismissed their previous lawyer, Wang Peiyuan, and hired another lawyer. Therefore, Lawyer Wang immediately left the court. At this point, the family members of the victims were summoned. Ma Jiaqing testified: I am 69 years old, a resident of No. 12 Xin Xiaodongmen, and a coppersmith. The deceased, Ma Koumai, is my young son, and Ma Chenshi is my daughter-in-law. Ma Chenshi testified that she is 28 years old and demands that the defendant be sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>And Compensation of 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The lawyers Guo Wei, Li Ming, Yu Xiangqin, etc., explained that the family of seven has worked for a total of 870 years, with an annual income of at least 300 yuan, requiring 26,100 yuan. In addition, there are 3,900 yuan for the elderly's funeral and the young's education, totaling 30,000 yuan. According to Article 506 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 23, Paragraph 1 of the Maritime Law, the Yuxing Steamer Company and the defendants should be held jointly and severally liable for compensation. All 93 defendants, even those who did not appear in court, must pay compensation. Those who had to pay a deposit to work on the ship can ask the shipping company to retrieve it. Bian Shouyi, the lawyer representing the Yuxing Company, stated that the plaintiffs used either Article 188 of the Civil Code or Article 23 of the Maritime Law against the Yuxing Company. However, the article must be limited to cases where an employee infringes upon the rights of others due to unlawful performance of duties. The employee's actions are nothing more than actions in the performance of their duties. Even if they unlawfully infringe upon the rights of others,</p>
<h3>It Has Nothing to Do With the Employer</h3>
<p>In this case, Sun Xingsheng and others are suspected of murder. Even if it is true, it is a personal act. This is not necessarily a murder committed in the performance of duty, so it has nothing to do with the company. At this point, the official questioned Mei You's, 26 years old, that the deceased Mei Laoer was her husband, demanding damages of 15,356 yuan. Tang Hao, the lawyer, explained that the family of four was calculated for 34 years at 144 yuan per year, including funeral and education expenses, and that the deceased was killed for not buying a ticket. The request is the same as Ma Chenshi's reasons, and Lawyer Guo Shouyi refuted as above. The hearing was adjourned until noon, so it was announced that the hearing would continue at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. In the afternoon, Zhou Ma's testified that she was 30 years old, from Pinghu, living in Xiaodongmen, and that her husband, Zhou Datong, was from Hubei, 32 years old. Asked what her husband did, she answered that he sold fruit on the Xin Renhe steamer. Her family has a mother, a son, and a daughter, and the family relied on her husband to earn more than 60 yuan a month to make a living. She now demands that the defendant compensate her 15,000 yuan and hired Zhang Qingyue as her lawyer to state that the monthly living expenses were 40 yuan, totaling 9,600 yuan for 20 years. Her mother's expenses were 10 yuan a month, totaling 1,200 yuan for 10 years, and funeral expenses were 200 yuan, and education and marriage expenses were 4,000 yuan, totaling 15,000 yuan. The Yuxing Company must of course be responsible, as the contracts it signed were all with those performing duties on the ship, and Wang Guanxian was representing the company's unlawful actions.</p>
<h3>The Most Vehement Advocate</h3>
<p>The victims and defendants had no personal grudges. If it were not for the needs of their business, they would not have been killed. Furthermore, looking at the case file, the tragedy occurred because the deceased did not buy a ticket, which clearly shows that it was in the performance of their duties. The defendant claimed they were pirates, so they took emergency measures, which, according to maritime law, is naturally the performance of their duties. The defendants committed unlawful acts out of loyalty to the company's duties, and the company must bear the responsibility. It is also morally justifiable for the victims' families to only seek compensation. At this point, Lawyer Guo Shouyi, again representing the company, argued that Wang Guanxian was only a nominal assistant manager. He went to Lingdian Port and came to Shanghai to recuperate. This was his personal matter and had nothing to do with the company. The matter of buying tickets is like selling poison, assuming the guilt of others, and is not the performance of duties. At this point, the official questioned Wei Zhu's, who was blind, and testified that she was 36 years old, living at No. 12 Xin Xiaodongmen, and that the deceased Wei Jinfu was her husband's nephew. They had not divided their family, and she relied on him for a living, demanding 19,800 yuan in damages. Zhu Shaowen, a lawyer, was hired to state that the calculation was 50 yuan a month for 33 years, including her aunt. According to Article 188, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, one should not infringe upon others when performing duties. For example, executioners are dedicated to killing people. Others performing duties should not specifically kill people while performing their duties. This case involves using the opportunity of duty to kill people, so the company should be jointly and severally liable. At this point, Lawyer Guo Shouyi again replied on behalf of the company, that Article 188 of the Civil Code, if interpreted as mentioned above, should require the legislators to add the word "中" (zhōng, middle) so that it can be said that infringing while in the middle of performing duty. Now there is a comparison, if an employer hires a servant to buy vegetables at the market,</p>
<h3>And the Servant Kills Someone on the Road</h3>
<p>Is the employer involved? He is also performing his duties, so it cannot be interpreted like this. Executioners are those who are not punished according to the laws in the criminal law, and the performance of duties on the ship is the interpretation of sinking and damaging other people's ships. At this point, Sun Zhou's testified that she was 47 years old, and that the deceased Sun Xinliang was her husband. Writing Shen Xinliang was a mistake. He was from Qingjiang and had a 72-year-old mother, an 84-year-old grandmother, a 16-year-old daughter, and a 3-year-old son, demanding 16,200 yuan. Lawyer Song stated that the calculation was 50 yuan a month, including funeral and education expenses. All the reasons for the company's liability have been detailed in Wei Zhu's statement. Guo Shouyi's statement was as before. At this point, Tang Hao also stated that three bodies were recovered in Lingdian Port and were collected by Haimen County. Whether they are the deceased, please submit them to the case. The official ordered that they be examined in the county. At this point, Zhang Tongqing, the defense lawyer for the defendant Wang Moqing, said that Wang Moqing is currently in custody.</p>
<h3>Writing a Letter to Sun Xingsheng</h3>
<p>Sun wrote a letter of reply, proving that Wang was not involved. (The letter roughly stated, "My younger brother was not involved at all. He was also unaware of your meeting. If you (referring to Sun Xingsheng asking me to sign) ask Wang Moqing, he claimed to have received the lawsuit. After receiving it, I asked someone to write a letter to Sun Xingsheng, and he replied (roughly saying, 'Endure a little hardship, leave it to fate')." The official then asked Sun Xingsheng, who replied, "I am illiterate. If I had written a letter to him, I would be struck by lightning. I also did not receive his letter," and so on. At this point, lawyer Shi Qinghua stated that this case was an extremely rare major case, so the esteemed presiding judge, not weary of seeking details, had already examined it for three days. However, Wang Moqing's sending and receiving of letters were mostly done within a single prison. He requested a strict interrogation, which would not only clarify the case but also prevent innocent people from being wrongly accused. The official then asked Wang Moqing, who replied, "The letter was not written by me; I asked someone to write it. The boat owner came and asked me to sign it." He was asked, "Was it the day the people were killed?" He replied, "I forgot the date, around ten o'clock." At this point, lawyer Lu Jiaqi stated that this case was the biggest case in Shanghai, and the severity of the sentence was extremely important. The indictment mentioned that it stemmed from the theft of Wang Sanlang's silver, but Wang Sanlang had not been summoned. The procedure seemed incomplete. If good and bad were not distinguished, it would be a great unease on moral conscience. If Wang Sanlang were summoned, the esteemed Cheng Company could summon him because Wang was from Chongming and could be found. At this point, the official asked Sun Xingsheng who wrote this document. He replied, "Chen Baosheng gave it to me to sign. I don't know who wrote it." At this point, the questioning official...</p>
<h3>Announcing the Start of Arguments</h3>
<p>Please ask Prosecutor Zhang Zi for his opinion. Prosecutor Zhang Zi said that this case can be divided into three points. 1. Sun Xingsheng, Guo Xihou, Lu Yongqing, Wang Moqing, Zhu Gulin, Chen Baosheng, Wang Guanxian, and others instigated murder. This criminal fact was confessed in the water patrol team. Wang Guanxian discussed with him about throwing the four people into the river, tying them up and throwing them in. They also said that the five people originally wanted to send them to the authorities for investigation, but because one person fell into the water and died, there was no way. So, they held a meeting on the ship and ordered Feng Xingfa, Shen Chuanlang, Shen Xingqiao, Wang Mingda, Liu Yongqing, Huang Fusheng, Zhang Tongcai, Wang Shouming, Little Wang Mazi, and others to tie stones to them and throw them into the river. 2. Feng Xingfa and others actually committed the murder, and there is the testimony of witness Gu Ji'an. Wang Mingda moved stones, and the deceased were on the Santaijia platform, which is also applicable to premeditated murder. 3. Wang Xingjiang and others conspired to murder. This part of the people is the most important because Sun Xingsheng and others had no way to deal with it, so they planned to silence them. In the beginning, it was confessed in the water patrol team one after another. However, considering this level, there are bound to be</p>
<h3>Passive and Fearful People</h3>
<p>This part, please consider sentencing accordingly. At this point, Sun Xingsheng's defense lawyer, Zhang Shijian, argued that the victims in this case were pirates who accumulated wealth by theft. They still wanted to kill people, causing public outrage, and were temporarily driven by righteous indignation. It was "anger arising from the heart and evil born from the gall," not a deliberate premeditation. In this kind of situation on the ship, like a state without government, without legal restraint, self-defense is the way. In ancient Chinese law, killing thieves is not a crime. Even civilized countries grant exemption from prosecution for self-defense. The families of Ma Koumai and others are in difficulty, but the deceased harmed people among the small merchants who earned one and a half dou of rice every day, which is extremely painful. Although the defendants are suspected of infringing on national rights, it is necessary to consider their nature. Therefore, Sun echoed everyone, and the crowd's gratitude has long been distorted. So, in our study of psychology, separating one person from the crowd makes them muddled and frightened by past events. Therefore, civilized countries have a different kind of criminal law for crowds. And the defendants and others</p>
<h3>Were Not Caught in the Act</h3>
<p>Most of the passengers left. If they had planned to kill, among these five people and passengers, would there not be sympathy for these five people? If it were a matter of passengers, the responsibility cannot be entirely on the crew. Criminal law adopts direct principles, and the confession of the water patrol team is not sufficient as a basis. Also, lawyer Cai Nipei argued that the prosecutor changed the criminal law to Article 284 for premeditated murder, and Article 285 of the indictment for exemption from criminal punishment. But regarding the premeditation layer, if they did not rob things, could they premeditatedly kill them? Therefore, the law must consider the original situation. In this case, the passengers Wang Sanlang and his wife took a small boat at Haihong Port to Haimenchuanhong Port. The thieves stole from passengers getting on and off the boat. When they stole Wang Sanlang's silver, they were seen, shouted, and the thieves transferred the loot to their accomplices. They punched out two of Wang's front teeth. His wife helped, and one eye was injured. This is very relevant to the severity of the sentence. The victims' bandit behavior</p>
<h3>Sufficient to Arouse Public Outrage</h3>
<p>How can it be said to be premeditated? Please summon the Wang couple to the case to avoid misrepresentation. This is stamped by dozens of shops and reported to the Qichonghai Fellow Villagers Association. It should be brought tomorrow. And there is also the name Chen Fugui on the contract. He stopped working in February, so how could he sign in March? This shows that it is not a document for murder. Therefore, please be lenient and exempt from punishment. At this point, it was 6 PM. The official ordered the arguments to continue the next day.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Annual Meeting of the United Savings Society</h3>
<p>|Domestic Product Factory Gifts|The United Savings Society is organized by members of the Youth Association. Its purpose is to connect friendship and promote savings. The day before yesterday was the Society's first anniversary, and a family and friends meeting was held at the Shipping Club. More than 60 people attended.

After the prizes, there were dances, Peking opera, magic tricks, and other entertainment, and the event ended at 11 PM.</p>
<h3>Two Chinese Police Officers Extort and Blackmail with the Pretense of Searching for Opium</h3>
<p>|Each Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment and Fined 200 Yuan|Chinese police officer Shang Lianjia from Qingjiang and Chinese police officer Tao Mingke from Beiping were escorting western police officer, Clerk, and Chinese police officer Feng Ruisheng to search for opium. The two police officers snuck into the premises and extorted 800 yuan from a local woman, Shen Wangshi, under the guise of searching for opium. The case was reported, and after investigation by the western police officers, the two were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. The plaintiff, Shen Wangshi, along with lawyer Zhan Jifeng, appeared in court to present the case. They were ordered to detain the two defendants and await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan sentenced Tao Mingke and Shang Lianjia to three years in prison and a fine of 200 yuan each for jointly receiving bribes and violating their duties. If the fine cannot be paid, it will be converted into one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. The number of days of detention before the verdict is determined will be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of one day for every two days of imprisonment, or one day for every two yuan of fine. The 800 yuan of bribes received will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Salaries Stolen from the Shenxin No. 6 Factory</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at around 8 PM, as the Shenxin No. 6 Factory in Yangshupu was distributing wages to its workers, two robbers suddenly arrived. One held a handgun and, after entering the factory, monitored the paymaster and forbade the workers from making any noise. They stole more than 1,000 yuan in cash and left. As the robbers left, they fired a shot into the air as a warning to prevent being chased. Afterwards, the factory reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation. The Yangshupu station sent detectives to investigate and continued to pursue the robbers.</p>

<h3>Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles</h3>
<p>A Good Way to Cure Diseases and Prolong Life. Human life and diseases are the most painful. Recently, someone advocated the ancient moxibustion method, which can cure diseases and prolong life. First, there was Wan Ping in the neighboring country who lived to 242 years old, and his wife lived to 221 years old. Ping's son, Wan Ji, was 196 years old, Ji's wife was 193 years old, and Ji's son, Wan Cang, was 151 years old. Cang's wife was 138 years old. This long-lived family of the Wan family has great scientific research value. Examining the reason for the health and longevity of their whole family, they use mugwort floss to moxibust the three-mile acupoints on both feet for ten days a month. Once this three-mile acupoint is moxibusted, although not everyone can live to more than 200 years old, it is indeed effective in curing diseases and prolonging life. The way of moxibustion has recently been scientifically researched. According to the results obtained, it has the same treatment method as Western medicine's protein therapy, can increase white blood cells, and eliminate various bacteria. It has a significant effect on tuberculosis bacteria. For example, to treat scrofula, one moxibustion will cure it and it will never occur again. It can also cure cystitis, as for increasing appetite, increasing weight, and curing malaria and frostbite, it is especially unnecessary. There is an ancient saying that if you want your body to be at peace, the three miles are often not dry. The moxibustion method is as follows: first cut a slice of ginger, as thick as a copper coin, and place it on this acupoint, then knead a ball of mugwort floss (remove the fine stems and soil from the mugwort floss, knead it until it is soft and hot, and it can be used), as large as a nail shoe tooth, and place it on the ginger slice, then light it with a thin incense, so that it burns slowly. If one ball of mugwort floss is burned and you still don't feel pain, burn another ball until you feel pain. Only after warming and feeling pain can it be effective. Once every three days, moxibustion is performed forever, to cure diseases and prolong life, you can hold the left coupon. At this time of the yellow scorpion season, all kinds of diseases are rampant, mosquitoes are born, and malaria is a concern. Moxibustion should be performed as early as possible. There is no better way to maintain health than this. If you want to know exactly where this acupoint is, you can ask Mr. Wang Jingfu for a one-time lesson without asking for a fee, so that you can perform moxibustion forever. Mr. Wang lives at 19 Lianzhuli, Aiwenyi Road. He is a good hand at acupuncture and is especially respected by those in the Xingye Bank. He has been giving acupuncture and medicine to the poor and sick for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Li Yongsheng, a Master of Throat Diseases, specializes in treating throat diseases in Dazhuziyuan, Pudong, and has long been famous. Mr. Li Yongsheng, a throat specialist hanging a gourd opposite the First District, First Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi, is a high-ranking disciple of Dazhuziyuan and has uniquely obtained the teacher's teachings. For all kinds of throat diseases, no matter how dangerous, even if the doctors have given up, Mr. Li can still save them, and they all return to spring. Moreover, his consultation fee is only 6 cents and 10 texts, so the patients who come to the door for treatment every day feel that the threshold is worn out. Recently, the daughter of Mr. Zheng Ruosun, a field reporter of a certain newspaper, suddenly contracted a throat disease, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Many doctors were unwilling to risk treatment. After hearing of Mr. Li's name, he hurried to beg for treatment. Sure enough, the medicine cured the disease, and he recovered completely in less than three days. He is truly a master of throat diseases in modern times. Since Mr. Li's original clinic is not enough, it is heard that he will move to a new house next door within a few days, so it is specially recorded for those who are sick to inquire.</p>

<h3>Assurance of Love Reply to Ms. Su Lin from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Answer: Miss, I have read your letter again and again, and I can't help but feel lost! One reason is that you, Madam, have a deep and touching affection for the relationship between husband and wife, and your words reveal your emotions. I admire the unextinguished customs of the Guofeng and lament the Huai of the Xiaoya. The second reason is that I, the reporter, have spent half my life with books and swords and have never entered the arena of love. I am honored to receive your clear question, but isn't it like asking a blind man for directions? In recent years, the national situation has declined, and there are wounds everywhere. The great enemy is in sight, and righteous indignation fills my chest. I don't know where to start with the private affairs of children's affection! This is not a hypocritical theory, but a sincere word from the heart. Madam, if you want to tell your husband about your subtle love at the time of Jinwu's exhaustion and in the Luowei, just as he loves you, this kind of love can only be explored in practice, just like learning to swim, you have to learn in swimming, you can't just ask for it in words and words. However, one of your questions, Madam, "What kind of responsibilities or duties should our women bear in the small family?", has something to say. Now women have been liberated from the era of men's toys; if men really serve the society, the country, and the crowd, and do not care about themselves and their families, then women will help their husbands or help them serve the society, not just for the sake of one person and one family, just like Nadezhda Konstantinovna Lenin, Yan Wei to Marx, who are worthy of the name. If so, then there is nothing that cannot be done, at home and abroad, big and small, society and country, small and white rice and red salt, the matter is the same. As for the books of love, as stupid as a fool, I have rarely recited them in my life, so I use the famous European love letters of the last two hundred years and modern love letters (both published by Shanghai Yadong Library) to answer you! However, Mr. Lie has said: "Young people especially need the joy and strength of life. Healthy games, swimming, racing, walking, various gymnastics, and interests in many aspects of knowledge. Readers, research, investigation, to the greatest possible extent. This is better than the theory and discussion of the problem of sex and the so-called "living to be full" which is given to young people. Healthy body, healthy spirit!" (Page 82 of Lenin's Memoirs. Shanghai Noon Bookstore). From this point of view, your husband's ability to protect your health with medical knowledge is indeed very precious. If your talent can encourage him to expand the love between the two couples to love society and love the country, to resist strong enemies externally and eradicate the giant scorpion internally, so that "there are no resentful women inside and no unmarried men outside," is better than the love between the two in the boudoir by thousands! What do you think, Madam?</p>

<p>|The Ministry of Education Wants to Curse and Issue a Statement| After students from Shanghai City Education Association Dianjiao Department, Free City, Chengmei, Yingli High School, requested the school to issue graduation certificates, and it evolved into a storm, the reporter met with an important official from the Ministry of Education to talk. According to his responsible statement, the department's intention for the high school students' graduation examination is to rectify the academic level that students should reach at the time of graduation, directly promote students' efforts and efforts, and indirectly promote the serious handling of education by educators and improve educational efficiency. Before formulating the entrance examination regulations, after many strict assessments and discussions, once it is notified and implemented, it cannot be arbitrarily changed. This year, all provinces and cities across the country, except for the war zones, which are temporarily exempt from holding the entrance examination due to special circumstances, are following suit one after another, and Article 79 of the High School Regulations stipulates, "Students who have completed their studies, passed the graduation results, and passed the entrance examination results shall be allowed to graduate, and the school shall issue graduation certificates. "It is already clearly stipulated that high school students' graduation certificates must be issued after passing the entrance examination results. On the one hand, the Ministry of Education re-instructed all national universities, colleges and specialized schools, and educational administrative agencies in all provinces and cities to instruct provincial and private specialized schools and colleges above the subject, starting from the 22nd year, except for the provinces and cities that have been approved by the Ministry of Education to be temporarily exempt from the entrance examination, such as the graduation certificate of the candidates, without the words "passed the entrance examination results", all are not allowed to take the exam, in order to show the Ministry of Education's intention to strictly implement the entrance examination, high school students should deeply reflect on themselves and concentrate on their studies to prepare for the exam, and must not delay themselves, etc.</p>
<h3>City Education Association Dianjiao Department</h3>
<p>Students who fail one or two subjects in the entrance examination should be allowed to temporarily enroll as special students. The Shanghai City Education Association Education Department telegrammed Nanjing Education Department Junjian, and the case investigated Junbu's promulgated graduation entrance examination regulations, and there is a regulation that students who fail one or two subjects in the entrance examination must participate in the next entrance examination and pass before they can enroll. In view of the importance of students' studies, if students who fail one or two subjects in the entrance examination are not allowed to enroll before participating in the next entrance examination, then this period of time will inevitably waste time and abandon learning. In order to seek remedy, the fourth temporary board of directors decided to telegram Junbu that all students participating in the entrance examination, except for the three subjects of Chinese, English, and Arithmetic, those who fail one or two subjects shall be allowed to temporarily enroll as special students. They may be changed to formal students after passing the next entrance examination and receiving a diploma, etc., recorded in the book, and presented to the Shanghai City Education Bureau for forwarding to the Jun for review. Is it feasible to look up and examine the compliance with the electric Shanghai City Education Association,</p>

<h3>Peking University Restructuring Trend</h3>
<p>President Xu of Peking University has submitted his second resignation. Art Institute high school students are against the termination policy. After the issue of the merger of Peking University occurred, acting President Xu Songming has already left Beijing and returned to Zhejiang, and submitted his second resignation to Education Minister Wang Shijie. The university office has prepared to hand over. The attached high school of the Art Institute unanimously opposed the closure. Normal University will affect the colleges of Peking University and oppose the education policy. The Peking University student movement, which affects the whole body, is about to expand. As for the Ministry of Education's order to cut off the departments of Peking University, it is not without reason. If you want to know the bottom line, you must first understand the changes in the organization of Peking University. The details of all parties are listed as follows,</p>
<h3>Organizational Changes at National Peiping University</h3>
<p>National Peiping University has been established for six years, and each of its colleges has its own long and glorious history. This time, the Ministry of Education suddenly ordered the university to merge and abolish departments and suspend enrollment in several colleges, which has significant implications. This kind of ministerial order is highly related to the organizational changes at Peiping University. Therefore, our reporter specially interviewed a professor familiar with the inner workings of the university. According to him, the university's current organization is formed by the merger of seven colleges: Women's Arts and Sciences, Law, Medicine, Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce, and Arts and Health. The original merger actually occurred in August of the 16th year of the Republic (1927). At that time, there were nine national universities in Peiping. The names of the nine universities were Peking University, Law and Politics University, Medical University, Agricultural University, Engineering University, Teachers University, Women's Teachers University, Women's University, and the School of Fine Arts. After the merger, they were collectively known as National Capital University, divided into departments of Arts, Sciences, Law, Medicine, Agriculture, Engineering, Teacher Training, Women's Division One, Women's Division Two, Commercial Studies, and Fine Arts. Attached to the Capital University were also five institutions: a middle school, an elementary school, a girls' middle school, a girls' elementary school, and a kindergarten. In June of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the National Revolutionary Army unified the North and renamed the old capital Peiping. Capital University was reorganized into Peiping University. Thus, our university diverged from what is now Peking University. However, the organization at that time was still different from today. At that time, following the French system, a University Council was established in the central government to oversee educational administration, and university districts were established in various localities to oversee local educational administration. Therefore, Peiping University at that time actually oversaw educational administration for the entire province of Hebei. Previously, the University Council had proposed reorganizing Capital University into National China University and had already taken over the various schools of the former Capital University and the Yi Nu (translator’s note: unclear meaning) Law and Political Science School, which was previously under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On July 10th, the National Government meeting passed the proposal to merge all national schools in Peiping to form National China University, with Mr. Li Yu-ying as the president. On August 16th, the Nanjing University Committee passed the implementation measures for the Peiping University District, in which the organization of the university headquarters included the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Law, Engineering, Supervisory (translator’s note: unclear meaning), Art, and Teacher Training, two pre-college divisions for Arts and Sciences, and a Russian Language Special Training School. On September 3rd, the National Government resolved to appoint Mr. Li Shu-hua as the vice president of National China University. On September 21st, the National Government resolved to rename National China University to National Peiping University and passed the organizational outline for the Peiping University District. In November of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Vice President Li Shu-hua of National Peiping University established the National Peiping University President's Office in the West Fourth Ward of the Huai Ren Tang in Zhonghai, Peiping, organizing a secretariat and a higher education office to handle administrative matters for the university headquarters. According to the measures established by the University Committee, the former nine national schools, the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Russian Language and Political Science School, Tianjin Beiyang University, and Baoding Hebei University were reorganized into eleven colleges, one special training school, and two pre-college divisions for Arts and Sciences, which were handled separately and were largely completed. Later, the central government slightly changed the original plan, and finally reorganized it into eleven colleges and five affiliated schools. The names and order were: (1) Peida College (2) College of Law (3) First College of Engineering (4) Second College of Engineering (5) First Teachers College (6) Second Teachers College (7) College of Agriculture (8) College of Medicine (9) Women's College (10) College of Art (11) Russian Language and Political Science College (12) Affiliated Middle School (13) Affiliated Girls' Middle School (14) Affiliated Elementary School (15) Affiliated Girls' Elementary School (16) Affiliated Kindergarten. In June of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved to cease the implementation of the university medical system. The Peiping University District was ordered to cease operations on July 1st. At the same time, the President of National Peiping University, Li Yu-ying, and the Vice President, Li Shu-hua, submitted their resignations. All case files of the National Peiping University headquarters were temporarily kept by a small number of staff. In August, the Executive Yuan of the National Government resolved that Peida College would become independent and retain the name National Peking University. The First Teachers College became independent and was renamed National Peiping Teachers University. The Second College of Engineering became independent and was renamed National Beiyang Institute of Technology. The College of Art became independent and was renamed National School of Fine Arts. In September, by order of the Ministry of Education, the affiliated middle school and elementary school were placed under the jurisdiction of National Peiping Teachers University, and the deans of the various colleges of Peiping University were appointed in rotation as vice presidents. On September 21st, the deans of the various colleges of National Peiping University organized a university affairs conference to assist the president in handling university affairs. The deans took turns serving as chairmen, with each term lasting two months, and the president's office was reorganized. In November of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), by order of the Ministry of Education, the affiliated girls' middle school, the affiliated girls' elementary school, and the affiliated kindergarten were placed under the jurisdiction of the Second Teachers College. In December, the Second Teachers College was renamed Women's Teachers College, and the First College of Engineering was renamed College of Engineering. In April of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), by order of the Ministry of Education, the College of Art temporarily remained affiliated with Peiping University. On February 7th of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the National Government approved the resignation of Mr. Li Yu-ying and appointed Mr. Shen Yin-mo as the president of National Peiping University. On the 9th, by order of the Ministry of Education, the Women's Teachers College and its affiliated schools would no longer be affiliated with Peiping University from the current semester, and would merge with the original National Peiping Teachers University to form National Peiping Teachers University. The Russian Language and Political Science College and the College of Art should be closed down year by year and no longer enroll students. Both should form separate liquidation committees to handle the closure. The Women's College should be renamed Women's Arts and Sciences College from the current semester. The various colleges and senior high school classes of Peiping University should be carefully planned by Peiping University to jointly operate a perfect affiliated senior high school. On the 18th of that month, President Shen Yin-mo arrived at the university to assume his duties and handled the improvement matters in the ministerial order in order. On August 10th, by order of the Ministry of Education, the presidents of the Russian Language and Political Science College and the College of Art should be appointed by the university president to preside over the college affairs. The original liquidation committees should be immediately abolished. After the complete closure of the Russian Language and Political Science College, it should be changed to a College of Commerce. After the closure of the College of Art, it should be changed by the ministry into National Peiping School of Fine Arts. On June 6th of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), President Shen resigned. On the 9th of that month, the seven college deans collectively resigned. From July 3rd, Mr. Xia Yuan-li acted on behalf of the position until the end of August. On September 9th, Mr. Xu Song-ming acted on behalf of the position. On November 26th, by order of the Ministry of Education, the Russian College should be closed down immediately and a College of Commerce should be established. The College of Medicine should be changed to a six-year system. The Women's Arts and Sciences College had few students and many departments, and should be merged. On November 22nd, by instruction of the Ministry of Education, the College of Commerce was approved for filing, but the Department of Diplomatic and Consular Studies had to be changed to the Department of International Trade, the Department of Transportation Studies had to be changed to the Department of Traffic Management, and the Department of Border Politics had to be changed to the Department of Industrial and Commercial Management. On December 21st, Mr. Xu was appointed by the Ministry to act as president. He had been working hard for half a year, and now everything was on track.</p>
<h3>The Seven Deans Retain Xu</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the colleges of National Peiping University spontaneously convened a joint meeting of the deans at the university president's office. Those in attendance included Sun Guo-feng, Dean of the College of Engineering; Liu Yun-chou, Dean of the College of Agriculture; Bai Peng-fei, Dean of the College of Law; Zuo Zong-lun, Dean of the College of Commerce; Gu Cheng, Dean of the Women's College; Wu Xiang-feng, Dean of the College of Medicine (representing Zhi Dao); and Yan Zhi-kai, Dean of the College of Art (representing Li Bin-yu). During the meeting, they discussed ways to retain President Xu Song-ming. The deans spoke one after another, unanimously agreeing that Peiping University was in a time of turmoil and urgently needed to work together. Therefore, they unanimously advocated sending a telegram to Mr. Xu to retain him. The original telegram was as follows: To Director Shen of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, please forward to President Xu Shiyou. Your telegram has been received. Thanks to your leadership in recent years, the university administration has been able to gradually become safe. At this time of reorganization by the Ministry, we especially rely on your talent to lead us in overcoming difficulties. We implore you to withdraw your resignation. Your younger brothers, Bai Peng-fei, Yan Zhi-kai, Gu Cheng, Wu Xiang-feng, Liu Yun-chou, Zuo Zong-lun, Sun Guo-feng, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Xu Submits a Second Resignation</h3>
<p>A professor from National Peiping University returned to Peiping from the capital on the 12th. When interviewed by a reporter about the Ministry of Education's attitude towards National Peiping University, he replied as follows: After President Xu (Song-ming) arrived in the capital, he personally submitted his resignation to Minister Wang (Shi-jie). In addition to retaining him in person, Minister Wang also sent Shen Peng-fei, Director of the Higher Education Department, to the Central Hotel to earnestly retain him. However, President Xu expressed his gratitude for Minister Wang's intention to retain him, but his intention to resign remained firm. He submitted a second resignation on the 10th and left the capital for Zhejiang the following night. Xu Sheng-zu, a professor at the College of Engineering, also said that the difficult situation at National Peiping University could only be resolved after President Xu returned to Peiping. No one other than President Xu could handle this matter because Xu had very deep feelings with all parties. If the Ministry of Education recognized this point, it would certainly continue to retain Xu. Although Xu did not want to be president for a long time, it was not easy to leave National Peiping University in fact.</p>
<h3>The President's Office Awaits Instructions</h3>
<p>The staff of the President's Office of National Peiping University received a letter from President Xu, instructing them to quickly complete the closure and prepare for handover. Secretary Chen Zhong-ping notified the staff of the Secretariat; Chief of General Affairs Section, Lu Jie-min, notified the staff of the General Affairs Section; Chief of Academic Affairs Section, Ms. Lin Su-shan, notified the staff of the Academic Affairs Section to handle matters separately. On the 12th, Chen Zhong-ping, Tao Liang, Zhao Duo-yun, Guan Yu-hai, Chen Bing-wen, and Wang Nai-hua of the Secretariat organized the case files. Lin Su-shan, Cheng Guang-ming, Yan Qing-zhao, Lu Ding-xin, Tao Guang, and Ms. Liu Xiao-min of the Academic Affairs Section were either organizing registration group charts and rosters or sorting out manuscripts, publications, and books for sale. Lu Jie-min, Shen Jia-dong, Li Han-kun, Zhao Qi-shu, and Zhang En-shen of the General Affairs Section were either reviewing accounts or compiling equipment catalogs. They were very busy, waiting quietly for the handover after the organization was completed.</p>
<h3>Art College Expands Efforts to Protect the School</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the student union of the College of Arts and Health held an emergency general meeting. Liu Jia-xiang, Zhu Chong-zhi, and others attended. Zhu Chong-zhi chaired the meeting, and Liu Jia-xiang took the minutes. First, the chairman reported on the progress of the recent work to protect the college. Then, the following resolutions were discussed and passed: (1) Resolution to issue and print a declaration of the general meeting: passed. (2) Resolution to send representatives to various schools for liaison and request assistance: passed. Jia-xiang and Zhu Chong-zhi were designated to visit the student governments of various schools with letters. (3) Resolution that the union should quickly produce a large number of slogans to post inside the college and at various schools to facilitate publicity: resolved that the publicity department should be responsible for handling it. (4) Resolution to request the college authorities to postpone the summer vacation: resolved that the social affairs department should handle it. (5) Resolution to contact the various colleges of the university to initiate a Peiping University School Protection Committee: resolved that the documentation department should prepare letters and the social affairs department should go to the various colleges for contact. (6) Resolution to schedule an invitation for newspaper reporters: resolved to schedule it for 1:00 PM this Wednesday.</p>
<p>Our reporter specially visited Yang Zhong-zi, the former president of the College of Art and current head of the music department, to inquire about ways to deal with the Ministry of Education's closure order. He replied as follows: The closure of the College of Art is an important issue for Peiping University that has been pending for a long time. When I served as president, I went to Beijing to visit the then Minister of Education Zhu (Jia-hua) to request that the College of Art not be closed because our college is the oldest art school in North China. If it were closed, the young people in North China who are studying music, painting, applied arts, and architecture would feel a loss of opportunity. Minister Zhu agreed to postpone the closure temporarily. If the College of Art could be run successfully within a year, then other methods would be considered again during the summer vacation of the following year. Subsequently, observing the future prospects, there were still problems with the College of Art. I study art and cannot develop the College of Art, but I absolutely do not allow art education to be interrupted, so I resolutely resigned from the presidency, not to serve as a funeral director. I was surprised when the Ministry of Education issued an instruction saying that the College of Art had been ordered to be closed a long time ago and should be closed this year. It is true that the College of Art was ordered by the ministry to be closed, but it was not ordered by the Ministry of Education to cease operations. I do not know where the word "cease operations" in this instruction came from. Our college has been ordered by the ministry to close down gradually and then reorganized into a vocational school. This time the ministry order only had the word "closure" and no follow-up. How can the current second and third grade students be properly taken care of? I cannot bear the closing of the Art College and feel deeply unhappy.</p>
<h3>Senior High School Entertains Reporters</h3>
<p>The Senior High School of National Peiping University invited the press at 1:00 PM on the 12th. Over 30 reporters attended. Yang De-zeng presided, and Han Zhong-quan reported, saying that the purpose of establishing our school was originally to meet the needs of the colleges of agriculture, commerce, law and engineering of Peiping University. Although it has only been established for two years, the achievements of each class have been highly praised by the society. This time, the Ministry of Education issued an order to suspend operations and order students to transfer to other schools. The students of our school belong to the third grade of senior high school, which is considered prohibited in the ministry order. The contradiction of the ministry order is like this. The most difficult is for the students in the Russian class. If it is suspended, other high schools rarely have such a class, which is a fundamental concern about losing educational opportunity. Our association is fighting for a way out for hundreds of students, fighting for a bright future for China, and vowing to oppose the Ministry of Education's incomplete rectification of Peiping University. I hope the press will provide assistance. Tea and snacks were served and the meeting adjourned around 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Overview of Jinan University in the Year After the War</h3>
<p>(3) (Chen Qiying)</p>
<p>(3) Departmental Organization and Academic Overview</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the school originally had five colleges: Literature, Science, Commerce, Education, and Law. During the summer vacation last year, the Ministry of Education ordered the merger of the Colleges of Law and Education. All transfer procedures for colleges, departments, and schools were completed properly during the summer vacation. Therefore, after moving back to the original school in Zhenru, the school's organization is divided into three colleges: Literature, Science, and Commerce. A. The College of Literature has five departments: Chinese Language and Literature, Foreign Language and Literature, History and Sociology, Political Economics, and Education. The Department of Political Economics is divided into two groups: Politics and Economics. The Department of Education is divided into two groups: Psychology and Educational Administration. A teacher training program is also established to cultivate talents for overseas Chinese education, and an affiliated experimental school is established for teaching practice. B. The College of Science has three departments: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. C. The College of Commerce has four departments: Accounting, Banking, Foreign Trade, and Railway Management. Each college has one dean, each department has one department head, each group has one director, and the teacher training program also has one director. Mr. Chen Zhongfan is still hired as the dean of the College of Literature, Mr. Yu Jitai as the dean of the College of Science, and Mr. Ye Yuan as the dean of the College of Commerce. Most of the group directors are former staff members to achieve familiarity.</p>
<p>Regarding academic affairs, the Academic Affairs Committee is responsible for handling them, with the Academic Affairs Conference as the highest authority. Meetings are held once a month to handle major academic matters. The Academic Affairs Conference consists of the deans of each college, the heads of each department, the directors of the registration, publication, and guidance sections, the director of the library, the chairman of the Sports Committee, and two professors designated by the president. The deans of each college, the directors of the registration and guidance sections serve as standing committee members, and the director of the registration section also serves as the secretary. The cases discussed and decided by the Academic Affairs Conference are executed separately by the standing committee members and each section. The Academic Affairs Committee has two sections: registration, guidance, and publication. The registration section handles arranging courses, evaluating grades, and compiling statistics. The guidance section handles reviewing student conduct and guiding student group activities. The publication section reviews manuscripts from student groups and publishes school publications. The library handles book purchases and storage. The Sports Committee handles sports equipment and sports guidance. The current directors of the registration, guidance, and publication sections are Mr. Zheng Baoning, Mr. Fei Zhemin, and Mr. Hu Zhaochun. Mr. Zhang Feng is still the director of the library, and Mr. Fan Shouzhi is still the chairman of the Sports Committee. With the responsible personnel's serious planning and the hard work of each staff member, the efficiency of the office has increased, which has never been seen before.</p>
<p>(Corrigendum) In yesterday's draft (2), the second paragraph of the repair of school buildings and the whole process, line 11, the sentence "arrange courses" and the following mistake should be followed by the following text, "and the losses amounted to more than 100,000 yuan. It was able to repair and purchase in the shortest time with only more than 80,000 yuan, and restore the old appearance. It is also beyond the unexpected." It is extremely urgent to correct the inconsistency of the tone.</p>

<h3>Modification and Manufacturing</h3>
<p>— Qifan</p>
<p>For example, if a piece of clothing doesn't fit us well, we can modify it or make a new one. For example, if a pair of shoes doesn't fit us well, we can modify it or make a new pair. We have the right to modify or remake things that don't fit us well.</p>
<p>However, modification is not as good as innovation. It is very difficult to modify something old well, and there is no guarantee that the modification will be suitable. It is better to manufacture a new one, which can be satisfactory. It is better to make a new piece of clothing and a new pair of shoes.</p>
<p>In the past, a qin player charged double the tuition for students who had already learned the qin than for those who had never learned it, because it takes more effort to correct bad habits than to teach beginners. This is the same principle as modification is not as good as new creation. It is heard that the central government has sent senior officials to guide public opinion across the country. People think this is a very difficult and ineffective task. After all, guidance is just guidance, not manufacturing. It is somewhat similar to modifying clothes and shoes, which is not a thorough solution. If you think public opinion is not suitable, can't you manufacture a suitable one? It is better to add a department specializing in managing public opinion to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Education than to send officials to guide it, because what can be guided can definitely be manufactured, and there is no doubt that what is manufactured will be more suitable.</p>
<p>However, there are various reasons why clothes and shoes are not suitable. Perhaps it is because the body has suddenly developed and grown taller, making the clothes difficult to fit. Perhaps it is because a sarcoma has grown on the shoulder or a large sore has grown on the ankle, so the clothes should have a hole in the shoulder, and the shoes can only be changed to slippers. However, it is probably not a wise idea to only think about opening holes in clothes and wearing slippers, without thinking about treating the sores or removing the sarcomas.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that guiding public opinion is indeed a difficult task, and manufacturing public opinion is not necessarily wise. If someone has a sarcoma on their shoulder, it is still necessary to open a hole in their clothes, but the clothes with holes are not very decent. Why not remove the sarcoma in the first place? If you want to get public opinion that praises your virtues, please do something worthy of praise first. Like Finance Minister Song borrowing cotton and wheat in the United States, hasn't he already received the praise of the Shanghai yarn factory owners and flour mill owners? Moreover, public opinion is not limited to articles published in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<h3>Cloudy Sky</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Cloudy sky, everything is gloomy, even my heart is gloomy.</p>
<p>I walked alone in the cloudy sky and gloomy air. Some people brushed past me, quietly, leaving their laughter behind me. Their lives are happy.</p>
<p>People are all dreaming about life. Middle-aged people dream about the past, young people dream about the future. But I am walking in this realistic cloudy sky and gloomy air.</p>
<p>Looking up, above is a silver-gray cloudy sky. A damp mist is covering the corner of the house, like smoke. Some flags are fluttering in the wind, making a slight, miserable sound. I walk blankly and indifferently. In the crowd, I am lonely, and I also have a lonely cloudy heart. A newsboy stood in front of me: sallow face, black eyes, with expectant light in his eyes. This face, these eyes, are all gloomy. "Great Evening News, Great America Evening News..."</p>
<p>I have no interest in reading the newspaper, and I have no intention of buying the newspaper. My heart has relaxed from tension. Moreover, what can this newspaper tell me? I can see a string of clever words concealing an ugly truth, but I cannot find news of a missing friend in it! I shook my head. He left in disappointment.</p>
<p>The cloudy sky still covers my head. Everything passed by me: gentlemen, ladies, movie theaters, cafes, the aroma of Luzon cigars, the sound of Jazz music.</p>
<p>A pair of White Russian men and women walked towards me, wearing dirty old clothes and muddy leather shoes, with haggard faces and some bitter smiles on the corners of their mouths. I seemed to have seen these smiles somewhere before.</p>
<p>I remembered that a month ago, I went to Wuxi for something. It was also such a cloudy sky. In the countryside, I met a farming couple sitting on a bench in front of their own thatched cottage, talking about the hardships of their lives. The man was smoking, and his face covered by the smoke was also gloomy, with a bitter smile hanging on the corner of his mouth. I remember this kind of bitter smile very clearly.</p>
<p>My heart began to feel a little painful. In this world, there are all kinds of painful lives. Whether they are people with a motherland or people without a motherland, they are all struggling in this painful life, but their bodies are still sinking down. Their lives exist on the edge of the circle of life.</p>
<p>I walk blankly and indifferently. The cloudy sky covers my head. A cloudy heart beats in my chest. I followed the original road back.</p>
<p>"Great Evening News..." The newsboy appeared in front of me for the second time. Sallow face, black eyes, with expectant light in his eyes. He only had one newspaper left in his hand.</p>
<p>I unconsciously took this only newspaper. Although I still had no interest in reading the newspaper and no intention of buying the newspaper, I finally took out money from my pocket.</p>
<p>When he reached out to take the money, I shook his hand by the way. His hand was icy cold. The cold air rushed into my blood vessels, attacking my heart, making my heart freeze completely.</p>
<p>"Poor child!" I couldn't help but say this in a low voice.</p>
<p>Cloudy sky, everything is gloomy. I hope this cloudy sky will pass soon.</p>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>When the doorman Jiang Siye and the gatekeeper were smiling at me, saying that the young lady had taken a liking to me, and that she wanted me to drive her somewhere every day, although I wouldn't admit it, I was secretly happy. It's not like it came from nowhere, like at the Orient the other day. I don't know exactly what the young lady was thinking, and maybe I was just too clumsy to know how to seize the opportunity. That was really a great opportunity. I was thinking about that day at the Orient when I heard that the young lady was telling me to prepare the car because she was going out. I thought, could it be that the opportunity at the Orient Hotel is coming again? Then I must seize this opportunity today and not let it escape. That day the young lady told me to go in with her and open a room to bathe. After the bath, she was barefoot in a short dress, telling me to pour out some XX dew (what kind of dew was it?) and bring it to her on the sofa, and then she asked Ke to sit down... Sit down, my god, how could I be so stupid? I didn't dare to sit next to her and retreated so far away to the other side...</p>
<p>But that was because I was too inexperienced. I am really too unfamiliar with women. I have to be bolder in the future. Like, today...</p>
<p>Today, the young lady was wearing a light green silk cheongsam with floral patterns, hanging down to the ground. As she walked, it floated up from a distance. As soon as she came out, she asked, "A Ni, is the car ready?" Her voice was like a silver bell.</p>
<p>I opened the car door for her, but she stepped into the driver's seat and sat down. Her onion-like fingers were neatly placed on the steering wheel. What should I do? What should I do? ...Jiang Siye, who was next to me, seemed to see my embarrassment and urged me, "Go up, the young lady knows how to drive." I felt like my head was swelling. I didn't know how to sit, side by side with the young lady in the front? Or should I sit in the back and let the young lady drive for me? My left foot stepped on the edge of the car twice, and I started to tremble a little.</p>
<p>A palm reached out from behind and pushed me into the car. The door slammed shut after that. I was very dizzy. The sound of the engine shook me a few times, and my body involuntarily leaned back. The car was already moving. My shoulder was rubbing against another shoulder.</p>
<p>I regained my composure and realized that I was sitting side by side with the young lady. The young lady's white jade-like fingers were constantly tapping on the steering wheel, with one or two glittering gold rings inlaid with gemstones. When we stopped at the intersection, I felt a strong fragrant breeze blowing around us. I didn't know what kind of things I would encounter today that would surprise me so much. On the road, I stole a few glances at the young lady. She only looked straight ahead, focusing all her attention on driving. Her driving skills were not bad, although it was a bit crooked and the turns were not very agile.</p>
<p>I didn't pay attention as we passed several streets, but when we arrived at the old place from the day before, the Orient Silver Shop. It was exactly the same. The car was parked in the same place as the day before. She smiled, opened the door on that side, and got out. What should I do? Be bolder, get out and follow her. I took the elevator all the way to the sixth floor, as if I was dreaming. The situation was exactly the same as that day: the waiter opened the door, and we went in together. She fell on the sofa and said, "I'm tired." Now, what should I do? The opportunity has come.</p>
<p>But she said, "A Ni, tell the waiter to bring two snacks." She was going to eat with me. I felt like a ball of fire was about to burst out of my chest. I was happy, but I didn't know what to do? I told the waiter as she said.</p>
<p>The young lady was taking off her makeup while saying, "I'll take a bath first. Tell them to wait a moment when the snacks come."</p>
<p>Yes, wait a moment. In less than a quarter of an hour, she had already gone to the bathroom in the back. I sat there, not knowing what I should think. Today...</p>
<p>So, I thought, after the bath, she would walk in barefoot in a short dress, and I would immediately pour her tea or something else and walk towards her, and then reach out and hug her... I was a little dizzy from thinking, and my chest was pounding. And the door rang, my heart beat even more violently. With trembling legs, I opened the door, but it was a young man in a suit. He nodded and came straight in, sitting down on the sofa without any humility. This made me a little annoyed. But I thought, maybe he was in the wrong room, he looked at the wrong number. So, I went over and asked him:</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Miss Zhou." He looked up. But our young lady's surname is not Zhou. I knew he must be wrong.</p>
<p>"There is no one here with the surname Zhou. This room is 508." "No? 508, yes, 508." He hurriedly pulled out his diary to check. He didn't seem to find it, he was a little flustered. I was waiting by his side for a chance to drive him away, but the young lady came out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're here?" She looked at the man with a smile on her face. The man turned around and laughed:</p>
<p>"508, I said it was 508, this friend said there is no one here with the surname Zhou, who else could this be but Miss Zhou?" I opened my mouth to argue, because the young lady's surname is not Zhou. I knew that. But the young lady stopped me and said to the man, "Okay, don't ask people if their surname is Zhou or Li." She waved her hand at me again: "You drive back first, I'll call you later."</p>
<p>I walked out of the elevator as if I had a nightmare. I spat and thought: What have I done? Jiang Siye was smiling at me. ...</p>
<h3>Red Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— JulesRenara Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Hunting Time (Continued)</p>
<p>Elated by his new achievement, he stated his method frankly. "Are you serious?" said Lébique. Red Carrot Whiskers: "Is there any need to say that! Of course, I wouldn't boast that I never fail. Lébique: "Shut your beak at once, you little fool. If you want people to continue thinking you're a smart kid, I advise you not to say such stupid things in front of others. People will laugh at you to your face. If you're just joking with your father, then of course it doesn't matter. Red Carrot Whiskers: "No, Papa, I swear. But you're right, please forgive me, I'm just a fool." Flies</p>
<p>The hunt continued, Red Carrot Whiskers shrugged with remorse. Feeling very foolish, he followed his father with a new passion, determined to step exactly where Lébique's left foot had stepped. He moved with great strides, as if fleeing a blood-sucking ghost. Only pausing briefly to pick a mulberry, a wild pear, or a few wild strawberries. These things were all sour, turning the lips white, but they could quench thirst. In fact, besides these, he also carried a bottle of eau-de-vie in one compartment of his hunting bag. Little by little, he drank almost all of it himself, because Lébique, wholly absorbed in the hunt, forgot to ask him for "a little sip, Papa?"</p>
<p>The wind brought a refusal. Red Carrot Whiskers drank the little bit of wine he had poured for his father in one gulp, emptying the bottle, his head swimming, and hurried to catch up with his father. Suddenly, he stopped, stuck a finger in his ear, wriggling it vigorously, then pulled it out, pretending to listen. He called out to Lébique: "Do you know, Papa, I think a fly flew into my ear." Lébique: "Get her out then." Red Carrot Whiskers: "She's gone in too deep, my finger can't reach her. I can hear her buzzing in my ear." Lébique: "Let her die there by herself." Red Carrot Whiskers: "What if she lays eggs in there, Papa, what if she builds a nest in there?" Lébique: "Try to kill her with the corner of a handkerchief." Red Carrot Whiskers: "What if I pour a little eau-de-vie in my ear and drown her? Do you allow me to?" "Pour whatever you want," Lébique shouted at him, "but hurry up." Red Carrot Whiskers brought the wine bottle to his ear, and he poured it in again, just in case Lébique wanted to ask for his share. Soon, Red Carrot Whiskers was running along happily, shouting: "Do you know, Papa, I can't hear the fly anymore. She's probably dead. But she drank all the wine."</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn – Just Right</p>
<h3>Prolonging Life and Promoting Longevity</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Old men are truly not to be praised. In Osaki Village along the Osaka-Kobe railway line, a group of 193 members of the Respect for Elders Association participated in a grand longevity feast. The old men opened their stomachs wide, not content with filling themselves, but also carrying food back to their villages, distributing it to family and neighbors, so that everyone could live a long life. Who would have thought that the result would be the opposite? Those who ate the food suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. Their stomachs were damaged by a batch of poisoned goods, leading to successive deaths and cries that shook the heavens! Starting with prolonging life, ending with promoting death. The old men got carried away and made a big mistake.</p>
<p>Originally, prolonging life and promoting death are opposites, but sometimes they are related. During the Tang Dynasty, the court and the common people were superstitious about elixir pills, believing that taking them could grant immortality. Who would have thought that eight or nine out of ten who took elixir pills would be poisoned by them, often leading to death and shortening their natural lifespan? Isn't this starting with prolonging life and ending with promoting death? However, shortening life by taking elixir pills is the individual's own fault. The poisoning of the old men in Osaki Village is not their fault, but the fault of the "Ting Song Pavilion" restaurant for being careless in preparing the dishes, resulting in the accidental harm of many lives. Blaming the old men for getting carried away seems like being overly critical.</p>
<p>Upon closer reflection, Ting Song Pavilion certainly bears a major responsibility, but it cannot be said that the old men suffered an entirely undeserved disaster. I am reminded of the words of Confucius, who said, "In old age, when blood and qi have declined, be wary of acquisition." Acquisition refers to greed, and its scope is very broad. Greed for sex is acquisition, greed for wealth is acquisition, greed for fame is acquisition, greed for immortality is acquisition, and greed for food is acquisition. Why didn't the old men in Osaki Village stay at home, embracing their yellow-faced wives and playing with their young grandchildren, but instead went, panting and puffing, to participate in this Respect for Elders Association feast? Analyzing their psychology, it was either greed for empty fame or greed for food. Having many councilors present and drinking in their company is certainly glorious—that is greed for empty fame. Having Ting Song Pavilion's famous chefs prepare dishes to satisfy their appetites is certainly greed for food. Because they violated the precept of "be wary of acquisition," they failed to preserve their old lives. The Respect for Elders Association turned into a Toothless Association, and the old men of Osaki Village all became fish that swallowed the bait. Alas! The harm of greed is indeed such.</p>
<h3>Relics of King Kang Crossing the River on a Mud Horse</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>My town (Changshu) is located in a remote coastal area, boasting the beauty of Yu Mountain. Visitors from afar, during the pleasant days of spring and autumn, come in droves. Kang Youwei and his literary companions often enjoyed themselves and forgot their weariness, writing poems about it. My literary friend Fan Yanzhi compared Yu Mountain to the small-scale landscape paintings of the Six Dynasties period, while Cheng Xiaoqing considered the mountain's majestic cliffs and the vast expanse of water the most unforgettable features. I have compiled a gazetteer of Yu Mountain to guide visitors, having explored the entire mountain, seeking out scenic spots and historical sites, and collecting information. I have also paid attention to the surrounding areas. To the east of Yucheng, about forty-two li away, is a place called Hupu, commonly known as Pengjia Bridge, an important river town in my county. During the flood season, it is exceptionally lively, serving as the main hub for importing seafood. People in the county who want to eat fresh fish, such as knife fish, yellow croaker, and mussels, must go there to enjoy their delicious flavor. Bringing them to the city would diminish their taste. About three or four li from Hupu is a village called Wencun. According to the locals, King Kang of Song landed there during his southward crossing. The village is very small, with only a dozen or so households, and even now it has fewer than a hundred families. The village originally had no name, but it was named Wencun (Asking Village) after King Kang asked about it. Today, the people there have changed the character "Wen" (問, ask) to "Wen" (文, culture), which is far from the original meaning. There is also a Madai Mound, said to be transformed from King Kang's mud horse. A tall pavilion has been built on top of it, and the pavilion has no name either. It is located behind the Mengjiang Hall, and an elementary school is attached to the temple. The sound of singing and music can often be heard outside the building. Inside the temple, there is an iron-stemmed crabapple tree, its flowers as red as cinnabar, hanging like strings of beads, which is very precious. North of the street is the Maji Bridge, said to bear the footprints of King Kang's mud horse. In reality, the Madai Mound has become a myth, and the idea that a mud horse could leave footprints on a stone bridge is even more of an absurd tale from the land of Qi, not to be believed. Later generations have preserved these relics to commemorate King Kang, allowing those who come later to reflect and sigh, not forgetting the high-mindedness of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, just like the Qin Terrace on Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou, which also has Xishi's footprints. The meaning is the same, nothing surprising. I happened to recall this incident, adding to my feelings of sorrow. King Kang crossed the river southward, suffering the invasion of foreign tribes. Although he was able to temporarily maintain a position of partial peace, he was ultimately destroyed by the Yuan people. Today's China, although the situation in North China has been temporarily stabilized by a peace agreement, the future changes in the situation are difficult to predict. Thinking of this, I throw down my pen and weep.</p>
<h3>Rural Sketches</h3>
<p>— Baixue</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival has passed. It is now the busy season in the countryside.</p>
<p>The wheat shines with a golden-orange glow; it is ripe but not yet fully mature, not yet ready to be harvested. In the woods of the front village, two or three migratory birds sing the cuckoo song. Their song seems to say: "Hurry, cuckoo, autumn harvest, autumn ripeness, hurry, cuckoo, happy, happy!" But at this time, a village child riding on the back of an ox passes by the melon fields, and when he hears the cuckoo's song, he shouts:</p>
<p>"Water the melons, sister-in-law sets fire..." The melon vines in the melon fields have only four tender leaves, like a small clump of flowers.</p>
<p>Families who raised silkworms early have already taken their cocoons to town to sell, and the cocoon shops in various places have successively opened for business. In the mulberry fields, however, there is still a group of men and women picking green leaves and flirting.</p>
<p>"The mulberry forest in April is tall and lush, the little sister's eyes glance at me, I quickly embrace the little sister, the little sister smiles at me..." A strong young man sang to this point, and already had a girl in his arms. The girl giggled and struggled, and the rest of the people clapped and laughed. Finally, he kissed her. This was followed by a burst of laughter from the onlookers. Farmers by the side of the field are digging ash ponds, which are prepared to store fertilizer such as grass mud and pig manure. Now, the farmers are busy working, fighting for their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>On the Separate Beds System for Couples</h3>
<p>— Drunken Idiot</p>
<p>Recently, several scholars, for the sake of emphasizing 'sexual hygiene', have specifically advocated the 'separate beds system for couples'. Such papers are often published in the 'Women and Family' section of the Morning Post supplement. This is certainly well-founded and reasonable. Unexpectedly, this aroused the opposition of the modern old man Mr. Xu Zhuodai; he said: 'A man or a woman, sleeping alone in a bed, is bound to have a special smell! But strangely enough, if a man and a woman sleep in the same bed, these two smells will disappear at the same time. It is probably a chemical reaction, mutually neutralized. It can be seen that men and women sleeping in the same bed is a natural match.' And so on: his reasons for opposition are truly humorous and simple. But in my opinion, it is perfectly fine to say a formal phrase, 'This matter is not worth discussing.' Because this 'separate beds system for couples', in the modern bustling cities, is really somewhat 'obstructive and difficult to implement.'</p>
<p>Think about it, Shanghai is a place where 'every inch of land is worth its weight in gold' and where 'the population is dense'. Here, rents are rising daily and residents are crowded. The norm is a small 'pigeonhole-style' family. It's rife with 'garret sisters-in-law', 'gentlemen upstairs', 'aunties in the back building', and 'grandmas in the kitchen', which is simply the wealth of language; truly 'a room as small as a dipper, barely enough space to sit'. As the saying goes, 'Sleeping here, eating here, gathering family here, and relieving oneself here'. What extra space is there for you to move around, for you to separate beds? Therefore, most people 'sleep in the same bed as their spouse': some, not only couples sleep in the same bed, but also bring many 'crystallized products', such as</p>
<p>A-da, A-er, A-san, and the like, to sleep together. The lively scene is simply like 'catching a ferry'. Some elderly couples, also imitate mandarin ducks by sharing the same quilt. There are also some who have one wife and one concubine, all within the embrace of a large quilt, which is also commonly seen. All of this is due to 'economic' and 'space' constraints, which force them to tighten up the 'problem of sleep'. Even 'building beds upon beds' is still considered too little space. In this situation, this separate beds system, apart from the 'wealthy class' of large families who can leisurely implement it, is fundamentally difficult to achieve. Now, I have a compromise solution, thinking of the next best thing when there is no other way, which is to change to the 'separate quilts system'. Sharing the same bed but with separate quilts, practicing the saying 'same bed, different dreams'. The Chu and Han are the boundary, each keeping to their covenant, not invading each other, which may reduce 'sexual impulse'. In this way, it not only does not hinder 'sexual hygiene', but also suits the 'harmony of smells between the two sexes'. Isn't this a comprehensive and easy thing to achieve?</p>

<h3>Northeastern Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: A Jest is Not Without Cause: The Eastern Bed Secretly Leads; A Sudden Arrival is Well-Reasoned: The Private Tutor Leisurely Plans Cinnamon Branches</p>
<p>Only now did he realize that his mother was faking sleep last night and secretly rejoiced that he hadn't promised a single word to Man Ying. As for Man Ying, watching the attitude of this mother and son, she felt that the Yang and Zhao families had a strong possibility of uniting. They sat and talked at the Yang family for half the morning, after which Old Master Zhao returned with his messenger, Little Lin. When Lady Jiang heard Old Master Zhao's voice, she went to the backyard to report the news. Standing in the courtyard, she called out, "Old Master!" Zhao Weng welcomed him out of the house, cupping his hands and saying, "Thank you for your care last night." Lady Jiang said, "Cared for what? A guest came last night, and my son and I were busy entertaining, almost forgetting to care for the backyard. Who are you talking about?" As she spoke, Lady Jiang stepped closer and whispered, "It was Miss Huang, who knows Company Commander Tian." Old Master Zhao stroked his beard and said "Oh." Then he smiled and said, "Young people are always impatient. If I had known Miss Huang was coming yesterday, I shouldn't have gone to the city." "Please invite him to sit for a while, I'll get the fire going and boil some water, then invite him over." Lady Jiang went back, while Old Master Zhao became very excited, helping Little Lin with the fire, boiling water, and tidying up the house. Before he had finished cleaning up, someone in the courtyard called out, "Old Master is back?" Zhao Weng peeked out of the glass window, saw a young woman who looked like a female student, carrying a roll of packages, and came to open the wind door in person, allowing Man Ying to enter, smiling and repeatedly cupping his hands, holding his fists high above his nose, and laughing, "You must be Miss Huang. In such cold weather, you've come from so far away, I'm truly sorry." Although Zhao Weng was old, his voice was very loud and clear. After entering the door, Man Ying bowed quickly, waving her hands at Zhao Weng and smiling softly, "Don't shout, don't shout, they don't know anything about my coming here." Zhao Weng nodded and smiled, propping his hand and inviting Man Ying to sit in the chair by the stove. Zhao Weng sat in the chair opposite her, stroked his beard again, and just stared blankly. Huang Man Ying whispered, "Old Master, congratulations, I've had this cup of wedding wine." Zhao Weng smiled and said, "I know what the old lady means, he has nothing to say, it depends on what the girl means." Man Ying smiled and said, "There's no need for the old master to say, I naturally know. What I mean is to explore the opinion of this girl, is that so? According to what he said to me last night, he has nothing to object to." (101)</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Jai Alai Court (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xi Cha</p>
<p>During the match, the whole court is silent, everyone holding their breath and watching intently, only hearing the sound of the ball bouncing off the wall and the sound of the pelota hitting the cesta, crackling incessantly. When the victory or defeat is decided, the sound of applause and "boo!" "boo!" sounds occur simultaneously, each person's facial expressions are different, with joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness all displayed. Discussions also arise.</p>
<p>"In the last round, Olanga ranked number three hit five points in a row, playing very vigorously. I bet that he would win 'three' and 'two' straight, you see! He's at three points now, just two more points, and my one hundred sixteen yuan and eight jiao will be safely in my pocket!" A man with a mustache wearing a suit boasted proudly, boasting of his good eye.</p>
<p>"Bilbao only scored one placement yesterday, I thought he would be hotter today, but who knew he would still be so lukewarm, I'm really unlucky!" A fashionable woman complained to her companion. "I told you to buy number five, but you insisted on buying number one, look! Number one doesn't have a single point now, what hope is there!" A woman complained to a man, judging by the look of it, that man was her husband. "Number two will definitely not hit five points in a row again, maybe number six straight wins, number two places." A large man wearing an Indian silk long gown, holding three number six straight win tickets in his hand, so his hopes were such. "··················" "··················" Everyone was still discussing, the next number of players came out to play again, so calm was restored. This continued, sometimes noisy, sometimes quiet, until a certain number of players had obtained five points, the referee blew a silver whistle, and the scoreboard hung up a certain number W (the mark for straight win) a certain number P (the mark for placement). At this time, some of the electric lights were restored to brightness, and the music and bell rang again. Those who bought the winning tickets took their tickets with smiling faces to the payout office to collect the money, while those who didn't win threw the tickets to the ground in disappointment, some angrily tore the tickets to shreds, counting it as venting their anger. Like this, round after round, ...... up to eight rounds, from the ninth round, another group of six players was changed, until the sixteen rounds were finished, the people in the whole court left their seats one after another, crowding out the main door of the court like a tide. On the stands are rows and rows of empty chairs, and the floor is piled with colorful waste tickets. These waste tickets, not long ago, were exchanged with white, shining silver coins and colorful banknotes, but now they are not even worth a copper coin! At the gate, cars were parked haphazardly to pick up the masters who came out of the court, and two or three police officers took care of and directed the vehicles, struggling for half an hour before gradually calming down. This is the section from Lafayette Road to Huanlong Road, where many rickshaws are parked. They are waiting for the patrons who came out of the court, but as soon as they see a patrolman riding a bicycle coming from north to south, they immediately pull up their empty cars and run away in a hurry. Dozens of rickshaw pullers are dragging empty cars and running on the road, as if holding a rickshaw race. Unfortunately, if they run too slowly and are chased by the patrolman, they have to be beaten a few times with a wooden stick.</p>
<p>On the sidewalks near the court, stood a few women with sallow faces, holding children, begging for money from the "masters," "madams," "young masters," and "young ladies" who came out of the court, but the "masters," "madams," "young masters," and "young ladies" were willing to give away thousands upon thousands of banknotes and silver coins in the Jai Alai court, but they were not willing to spend one or two copper coins to give to the poor, so as usual, they "turned their heads and did not care."</p>
<p>A ticket-buying servant followed the crowd out. As he walked, he checked the small change tickets that the court customers had given him. Seeing that the amount was not large, he felt dissatisfied. "Damn! Chinese people are really cheap! Why do they want to give money to foreigners?" He complained. His words were very right, but he forgot that he was a slave to the damn foreigners!</p>

<h3>Financial Swap Daily Gold Market Exhaustion</h3>
<p>Due to the influence of the US accepting British debt repayment in silver, swap short positions posted a high of $10.08. Yesterday's gold market saw exhaustion from swaps.  Trading in the forward market was mediocre, with an unstable situation. Major players were largely inactive, with only retail investors participating.  Initially, the overseas silver market saw declines in both London and New York, with the London to New York rate down 0.7375, while the New York to London rate was up 0.25.  Stocks and commodity prices fell slightly.  Initially, raw silver prices were slightly higher, but after the market opened, Reuters reported that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain announced that US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had accepted Britain's request to repay $10 million of its debt to the US, using silver valued at $0.50 per net ounce.  As a result, the morning opening was lower, with Bingxing, Ruixing, and Shunli all selling. Afterwards, prices rose and fell with the exchange rate and retail investors' bidding, remaining unstable.  In the afternoon, prices initially rose due to the large swap premiums, followed by a report of rising prices in Mumbai, causing the exchange rate to loosen unexpectedly, and triggering a rise and fall trend.  Raw silver prices were raised to $95, and the June/July swap premium was $12.20. The opening price for July/August saw long positions posting $9.70. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $907, slightly lower than the previous day.  Silver bullion opened at $7.50. The exchange rate opened with London weak and New York flat. The near-term selling price for the London exchange rate was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 4375, and the New York exchange rate was $26.375.  Materially, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Yu Yuanmao, Yongda, Xingyong, etc., all purchased.  Banque Belge booked US dollars for July at half a dollar, which rose to $13.20. Fuchang sold bars, gradually declining.  When Mitsui offered US dollars for September at $8.875 and for August at $6.6875, the price fell to $907.50.  HSBC quoted London flat and New York long at 0.125. At this point, prices fluctuated around $10.  Bingxing and Hengxing took bars, rising to $2.80.  Zhaofengchang sold, with the situation remaining low. Although retail investors gave strength, and the exchange rate was quiet, Qianchangxiang and Yuanheng bought bars, with no counterparties, and rose again to $14.50. Citibank offered US dollars for July at $4.4375, and Banque Belge offered again for August at $6.6875. At this time, Citibank was still willing to sell, and Shenyu Yuan, Sheng Yong, Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yong, etc., all sold, retreating to within $10, with very little trading.  Prices fluctuated around $10 for a very long time.  Andar booked US dollars for September at $8.875 and pulled up to $12. Zhifeng Yong sold bars, remaining within $10. When Korea sold US dollars for August at $7.75 to Banque Belge, Dadecheng once sold, falling to $907.50. However, because Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Zhaofengchang, etc., took in a small amount, the price gradually pulled up. Generally, retail investors were on the long side, raising prices. Once the banks took a liking, they rushed to $13.30.  Huifa offered US dollars for September at $8.875, and scattered lots were sold off, suddenly flowing downstream. Mitsubishi then offered $7.75 for August, retreating to $909. Yuanmao Yong limited purchases, and the noon closing was $910.  Silver bullion was raised to $11 at the noon closing. The afternoon opening was $910, and silver bullion opened at $10.02. Yuanmao Yong took bars, rising from $9.  Swaps had opened, with the short side posting $8 or $9, increasing to $10. Zhifeng Yong and Daxing Yong all entered, reaching $2.  The Dalian and Guangdong gangs dropped long positions, causing both swap prices to retreat.  After entering, the premium increased to $10.08. Daxing Yong Yuanmao Yong entered to $13. Maccary offered US dollars for September at $8.875, and Zhifeng Yong and Yuanheng both sold. Mumbai reported a rise of 4 annas, reaching $10. Fuyu Tongtaichang entered to $1.30, and Andar sold US dollars for September at $9.375. Xiangmeng wanted to offer this price but could not.  Hengyu Fuchang sold to $909, and Runchang Yufuyu sold to $7.50. Hengxing strongly purchased many times, once rising to $9.30, but the exchange rate was loose and excessive.  Xiexing Yong, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, etc., all sold. Fuchang sold even more aggressively. Banque Belge offered September at $27, and soon even $0.125 had no buyers, immediately falling to $903.20. Fuyu Yuanmao Yong still bought, and the closing was $905.  Silver bullion closed at $6.50. After the market closed, it once rose to $8.  The highest price during the day was $914.50, and the lowest price was $903.20, with a fluctuation of $11.30. As a result, it closed $3 lower than the previous recovery.</p>
<p>The quoted price increased because HSBC Bank's New York exchange rate increased by 0.125, to $26.625, equivalent to a gold price of over $936.  According to the closing price, the deduction was about $31, more than $1.50 less than the previous close. The registration price for this month was $923, and for July it was $910.  The morning supplement was $923, and the afternoon supplement was $918.  Raw silver prices increased by $95, still with no source.  The June/July swap was posted by Ruikang to Tongfengheng at $12.20 for 8 contracts. There were still 4,137 contracts remaining for June.  Trading in the market was quiet, a phenomenon that is inevitable on swap days.  In summary, Hengxing, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Qianchangxiang, Daxing Yong, Tongtaichang, and Fuyu were on the buying side, while Wanxing, Shunli, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, Dafayongchang, and Shengyong were on the selling side.  The Dalian gang and Wanxing sold about 400 contracts in the forward market, and Shunli also sold dozens of contracts, but not much in the afternoon market. The Guangdong gang Hengxing sold first and then entered, entering about 400 contracts in the afternoon market. There were a total of 23,170 tokens for July.</p>
<p>The current swap (July to August) was preliminarily done after 2 PM. Initially, the short side posted $7 or $8, but there were no transactions. Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Honglichang, Shengyong, and Fenyong posted, immediately rising to over $9. The Guangdong and Dalian gangs then posted, and Fuyu also dropped long positions, trading actively around $9.50. Afterwards, Ruixing, Chunyuan, Yongda Xingyong, and Qianchangxiang continued to post, rising to over $10. The highest was $10.08. Hengxing limited posting at $11 but did not obtain it. Fuchang and the Dalian gang came again to drop, again retreating downwards. At 3 PM, the opening was for long positions posting $9.70. Cuichang Yiyu posted, gradually increasing to $10.07. Yuanheng etc. posted, and Hengxing also came to drop, once retreating to within $10 (no quote), but the short side was in urgent demand, and the closing still rose to $10.08. Bingxing Yuanmao Yong also posted. After the market closed, it increased to $11, and Yisheng came to post, and the situation became flat. The posting side was mostly the Dalian gang, the Guangdong gang, Fuchang, and Yuanheng, while the posting force was more from Ruixing, Qianchangxiang, Changshengyong, Hengyu, and Daxing Yong. There were not many tokens, and there was no excessive difference.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate Turned Loose Again Yesterday</h3>

In the banking industry, Mitsui and Mengsai were the most aggressive. Citibank, Banque Belge, HSBC, and Korea were also sellers. The gold industry bought around 300,000 worth.

<h3>Call Loan Interest Rate Remains at Five Points with Haircut</h3>
<p>| The silver and money industry has more complex period-end settlements | Generally, the overall situation in commerce is usually quieter during the summer months. Naturally, this year is no exception. Therefore, the flow of various goods recently has been far less burdensome than in previous weeks. However, imported goods are crowded, especially Japanese goods arriving in droves. All remittance and order funds must be settled on time, barely embellishing the market scene, giving the impression of a prosperous situation. As for the market's call loan rate, it is one point lower than the previous day, opening at five points. Both morning and afternoon followed the same pattern. The haircut with added water also remains the same, calculated to be between four and six points. The trading of call loan slips was slightly higher than the previous day.

<h3>Securities Market Sees Bull and Bear Stalemate, Bond Market Dull</h3>
<p>Turnover decreased slightly, around 0.2-0.5 yuan. Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market continued to revolve around the bull and bear sides, who increasingly insisted on their positions. Although the Japanese army had withdrawn and the Feng incident had a considerable resolution, the market price did not rise in response. The phenomenon of stagnation was visible throughout the day, and the bullish congestion was quite evident. The morning opening was chaotic, with the market price still showing ups and downs. The difference in the rise and fall was only 0.1-0.2 yuan. Popular sentiment remained sluggish. In the second session, the Northern Gang sold, and the market price uniformly fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan.

Transactions were becoming increasingly sparse. Besides swaps and slight arbitrage trading, new transactions were quite rare. Generally, people believed that financial short-term government bonds might be sold in large amounts, and it would be difficult to see a favorable market price for the time being. The total number of transactions was 8.702 million yuan, including 7,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures and unified salt tax accounted for 2.94 million, demobilization accounted for 1.13 million, 19 Customs accounted for 940,000, and 20 Volume 20 Customs accounted for 2.1 million. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to 3-400,000. 96 and Taishi were over 140,000.</p>
<h3>US Dollars Dominate the New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Six Lines reported that on Wednesday (the 14th), the New York stock market only followed the lead of the US dollar. Initially, it was weak due to the strength of the US dollar. At the end, it turned upward due to the weakening of the US dollar and the early convening of Congress, as well as the prospect of balancing the budget. Also, according to the Steel Age magazine report, the steel workload this week increased to 47%, which is the highest peak since May 12, 1931. The furnace workload will be further expanded. Therefore, a slight increase in steel prices seems inevitable. The entire day's stock trading was 5.55 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Increased Tax on US Cotton and Flower Leads to Good Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, but the actual demand was quite sluggish. Various gangs had not yet moved, so people's hearts were calm. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was news of increased tax on US cotton, and raw cotton rose, causing the yarn market to rise sharply, but the factories felt very distressed due to the high price of raw materials. The talk of stopping night work was still prevalent.</p>
<p>(Ren Biao Good Yuan Xu) At the Ren Biao forward market opening, the market lacked buyers due to the flat and weak US cotton. Each month decreased slightly by 0.1-0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that US cotton was trending upward, and the market sentiment was strong. Each month rose by 1 yuan to 1.24 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 30,200 bales. It was found that Senkang sold 3,150 bales, Yukang 1,000 bales, Tongxing 1,950 bales, Xincheng 800 bales, and Yongchang 800 bales. Dafeng bought 1,850 bales, Tongji 1,300 bales, Gengfeng 1,100 bales, and Changfeng 2,300 bales. The closing prices are as follows.</p>

<p>(Spot Yarn Clear and Firm) Spot yarn sales are still sluggish. According to statistics, the total number of bales bought by each gang throughout the day was 395 bales. The market price rose by 0.5 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows.</p>
<p>Mainland 165 Guangdong 40 Same Industry 130</p>
<p>Xiamen 35 Northern Gang 25</p>
<p>The cotton market rose sharply, but the trend of foreign cotton remained weak, so the market situation trended lower. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was news of US cotton drawing a manufacturing tax. People's hearts were shaken, and the bullish side became active, buying in large quantities. The rising trend was particularly strong, but some people took advantage of the rise to sell a lot. In the long-term market, the Ningbo gang sold off new flowers in large quantities.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Rose by 0.8-0.9 Yuan) Zheng Biao's forward market opening was still flat because the rise and fall of US cotton were mixed, and people's hearts were calm. Each month rose slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was a rising trend in US cotton, and speculators bought in. Each month rose by 0.6-0.7 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 94,400 piculs. It was found that Yuanda sold 4,300 piculs, Yifeng 2,300 piculs, Ruiyuan 2,300 piculs, Dachang 2,900 piculs, Mingde 2,700 piculs, Changfeng and Gengfeng 3,000 piculs, and Tongji 3,000 piculs.

<p>(Spot Cotton Factory Needs are Lively) The spot cotton need is still good. The source is calculated to be 220 bales of Yao flower, 54.00 bales of Lingmai flower, 140 pieces of Hengfeng entering the factory, 48.00 bales of Shaanxi flower for public welfare, 320 pieces again and again 47.00 bales, 500 pieces of Yihua entering, 40.00 pieces of Tianjin coarse velvet, 300 pieces of Yinghua entering, 44.00 pieces of Jianjiao New Fire machine, and 800 bales of Dongmian entering the factory in September and October.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Rose and Fell Very Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton was mixed. It fell first due to good weather, and then Wall Street strongly recovered. As a result, the spot price fell by 5 pounds per sound, and the futures price rose and fell. Liverpool cotton remained unchanged for spot prices, and the futures price rose by 3-5 points. Egyptian cotton's spot price fell by 2 points. The Mumbai cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 14th).</p>

Since January of this year, the average monthly sales volume has been 19,000 bales, which has exceeded the average sales volume by 10,000 bales. This is unprecedented this year. The buying sentiment of the Tianjin gang is very strong. Indian and other overseas markets are also ordering from Japanese merchants in Shanghai. The sales volume of each port is listed below (unit: bale). Location Bales Location Bales Tianjin 5,696 Dalian 2,433 Hong Kong 845 Qingdao 2,455 Southeast Asia 355 India 6,085 Siam 50 Japan 2,095 Shanghai 9,252 Zhifu 50</p>
<h3>Statistics of Cotton Stored in Local Warehouses at the End of May</h3>
<p>| 188,056 Pieces |</p>
<p>At the end of May, according to a survey by Gaoerting Foreign Firm, the number of cotton stored in Shanghai warehouses is as follows. Chinese cotton is calculated at 500 pounds per bale. 10,257 pieces of US cotton, 177 pieces of Yuyao cotton, 1,000 pieces of African cotton, 851 pieces of Shandong cotton, 29,060 pieces of Indian cotton, 14,835 pieces of Shaanxi cotton, 1,150 pieces of Egyptian cotton, 10,1423 pieces of Tianjin cotton, 1,850 pieces of Burmese cotton, 1,077 pieces of Tongzhou cotton, 567 pieces of Jiujiang cotton, 700 pieces of local cotton, and 24,20 pieces of Lingmai cotton, for a total of 188,056 pieces.</p>
<h3>Live Prices are Offered for Thick Japonica Fresh Goods</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday's source was 30-40, and sales were still acceptable in the shops and stores of the street, but they all preferred fresh goods. Therefore, the price of fresh thick japonica from the Sutong gang and Nangang, etc., increased by several points to jiao. However, medium-grade goods remained stable. Changbang thick japonica felt soft due to dull sales. There were still thousands of bales. In addition, the selection was strict, so the price of Qingjiao Songs, Sibao, and other thin rice did not fluctuate. The same was true for Duyang sharp rice. Yuan was not honored or disgraced, but since it lacked goods, the sales of Yin Yuan were active, and the price was uniquely outstanding.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday's source was 27-8 from various routes down the river. The going of white japonica was slightly better. The thin rice arrived in succession, and the scattered fresh, second-rate goods continued to be delivered. The medium-grade goods were dull, and the market condition was fixed and the second-rate was tired. The arrival of Yangdu sharp rice was small, and sales were active, with a fixed market condition. The price of Hubu customers was slightly better and stable. The white yuan was tired and nearing its end.</p>
<h3>There are no Big Movements in the Flour Market</h3>
<p>| The standard for this month can still be drawn and bought |</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market presented an initial stability followed by a flattening trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat retreated by about 0.3-0.4 yuan, but since the factories hoped for the same, they unanimously threw it out. Outside industry sentiment then slightly rose to 0.075 yuan. Near-term prices rose slightly because guest gangs had slightly traded but the rise and fall were minimal, and it was exceptionally deserted. When the afternoon market opened, outside buyers were still trading less due to the good weather. Small factories slightly released their stalls, and the asking price showed fatigue. Judging from this situation, it seemed that factories and customers were all waiting for the new wheat to arrive in large quantities before making plans. As a result, this month was 0.25% smaller, the July-September months were unchanged, the October month was 0.25% smaller, and the November month was 0.025% better. The standard for this month can still be drawn and bought, and there are no restrictions.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market is Stable with a Swinging Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market was swinging but slightly turned stable. Due to the weather being cloudy and sunny, the wheat harvest in each producing area was therefore delayed. In terms of the goods that had arrived, the quality was insufficient. At this busy time, there was inevitable disappointment. Although the actual need was not urgent, people's hearts were inevitably turning to the market. As a result, this month was not opened, July was 0.01 yuan better, August and September were 0.02 yuan better, and the rest were not opened. The situation of new wheat is still flat. Wheat from various routes has been loaded onto vehicles and ships. Large factories have no intention of entering the market, and small factories are picking high to handle. Hozhou wheat was opened at 3.9 yuan, Puzhen wheat at 3.9 yuan, second grade to 0.8 yuan, and Wuhu wheat at 3.84 yuan, totaling over 1,300 bales, which were handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods, Most New Dried Lychees Experienced Poor Harvests</h3>
<p>The harvest of dried lychees varied in each producing area this year. For example, Haikou was only about 20%, Guangdong was 30-40%, and Zhangzhou had 80-90%. Secondarily, the Yuanhong lychee flower seedlings in Quanzhou were still good, but the number produced was inherently small. It was heard that Xinghua was also average. However, sales have been extremely sluggish recently. Although the general trend is more deficiency than abundance, the market price is still feared not to be too high when new ones arrive.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Bulk Tea has Already Opened</h3>
<p>First-class Pingshui bulk tea is known for its prosperous sales to the United States. In recent years, due to the impact of Japanese tea encroachment on sales, the going of American villages has gradually diminished. This year, many tea houses along the road have changed to producing fancy teas to sell to France. Yesterday, the colorless bulk tea from the road opened at Jinlong and Yihua, priced at 61.5-67.75 yuan, which is 20% lower than last year. Trading of Luzhuang Zhenmei, Zhenmei, and Gongxi items continues to be strong. The market for core-drawn Zhenmei has already rebounded by 4-5 yuan. The rest are also stable. However, although Tianyu Yihua and other lines have sporadic purchases of black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, etc., the bottom stock is flat and thick, and the market is still falling and not rising.</p>
<h3>Nantong Fresh Cocoons Have Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The cocoon market ended long ago, and all cocoon houses have stopped weighing. Most of the fresh cocoons collected have been dried, and dozens of packages of new sample cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai and are now being sent to the factory for silk testing to observe the size of the discount. According to the personnel who went to Tong to collect cocoons, the fresh cocoons produced this year have an average drying discount of only 280-290 catties.</p>

<h3>Matters of Conscience</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Opening today's newspaper, amidst many theater advertisements, I discovered four large characters in white on a black background: "Matters of Conscience." Above them were two smaller characters, "Resolution." Close beside them were two lines of antithetical couplets in the style of a funeral dirge, posed as rhetorical questions. The first line was: "For the sake of the nation, the bodies of the fighting soldiers who sacrificed themselves are exposed, their fresh blood not yet dry; can you bear it?" The second line was: "The loyal and brave brothers who killed the enemy are crippled, their arms and legs broken, groaning in bed; can you bear it?" This certainly struck me like a Zen master's shout. "For a long time," I have suspected that my "conscience" was gone, so hearing these two words felt like having a scab ripped off.</p>
<p>Drawn by the lure of the words "Resolution," I read on, but unfortunately, I was met with disappointment. Below were listed the names of more than ten "ladies" and "gentlemen." Under each lady's or gentleman's name was noted something like "dance" or "music." The last line read: "Ticket sales at major companies and stores." This turned out to be an advertisement for a "Comforting North China Wounded Soldiers Entertainment Tea Dance" organized by the "Shanghai Society of Ladies' Joint Celebration." After carefully reading the whole text, apart from "ladies," "socialites," "dance, dance, dance," "music, music, music," there was not a single word about "conscience." I suspect either the writer changed the topic halfway through or the typesetter made a mistake. Only after reading it three times did I suddenly understand that this was a clever way for the "ladies" (i.e., the upper-class Chinese) to "resolve" the "matter of conscience," and it had nothing to do with the general public, who, while also Chinese, are not upper-class. "Comforting North China Wounded Soldiers" is such a solemn term, yet it must be done through an "entertainment tea dance." I deeply lament that the "conscience" of the people of our country has become so numb that it requires strong material and sensual inducements. I feel somewhat apprehensive, but the organizers' ability to have such a discerning eye, seeing through the weaknesses of the people and skillfully guiding them with benefits, is also a rare thing. Spending several silver dollars, one can ascend to the halls of the Grand China or Grand Shanghai, both satisfying one's appetite for song and dance and simultaneously "resolving the matter of conscience." The wounded soldiers in North China also receive their blessing. Isn't this cheap and good, achieving three things with one stroke? Alas, indulging in art, dying for art, how wonderful!</p>
<p>Finally, I must copy those two long lines in the style of a funeral dirge to serve as the ending of this article. For the sake of the nation, the bodies of the fighting soldiers who resisted the enemy are exposed, their fresh blood not yet dry; can you bear it? The loyal and brave brothers who killed the enemy are crippled, their arms and legs broken, groaning in bed; can you bear it?</p>

<h3>Feelings</h3>
<p>— Ye Wei</p>
<p>Five thousand square miles block the stationed troops,</p>
<p>News arrives, filling my eyes with hot tears.</p>
<p>Why must the war bones be buried in remote lands?</p>
<p>The battle flags will never emerge from the Great Wall again.</p>
<p>The White Mountains and Black Waters are just empty dreams,</p>
<p>The Japanese rain and barbarian wind forever obstruct the sun.</p>
<p>Ashamed of being content with a corner of peace,</p>
<p>The Tanggu Treaty recklessly yields to a pact.</p>
<p>For a hundred years, grieving for this body in distress,</p>
<p>Affairs obscure my true self.</p>
<p>Vast winds and clouds endlessly change and transform,</p>
<p>Surging heavens and earth are filled with greed and depravity.</p>
<p>Long weary of the noisy and clamorous human world,</p>
<p>I cherish the simplicity of the ancient people.</p>
<p>I have long had thoughts of carefree detachment,</p>
<p>I wonder where to find a fairy neighbor to befriend.</p>
<h3>A Motley of Names</h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>Our country is vast and populous, with differing dialects. Taking just names as an example, they also vary from place to place. Although this is caused by local customs and conditions, the reason cannot but be attributed to the lack of widespread education! For example, the children born to country folk in this city are called Ah Mao, Ah Gou, Lao Hu, Xiao Mao, Ah Long, Ah Tu, and so on, ad infinitum. Crowning proper names with the names of wild beasts and livestock is not very refined, is it? It is said that when these parents have children, they are overjoyed and regard them as the apple of their eye, so they call them Ah Mao, and I call them Ah Gou, without regard for being elegant or refined. Moreover, before their children are even a month old, they must first invite a fortune-telling blind man to calculate their Eight Characters. If the child has all Five Elements, they call him Quan Xing or Quan Sheng. If the Five Elements are lacking in metal, they call him Jin Sheng. If the Five Elements are lacking in wood, they call him Mu Lin. If the Five Elements are lacking in water, they call him Ah Hai or Ah He. If the Five Elements are lacking in fire, they call him Ah Huo. If the Five Elements are lacking in earth, they call him Ah Tu Sheng. Hence the common saying, "Ah Tu Sheng, Ah Mu Lin," as a form of mockery. In fact, Ah Tu Sheng is not necessarily boorish, and Ah Mu Lin is not necessarily wooden-headed, but it's just a way of joking about these names that make a great deal of construction and landscaping. Still others use Ah Da, Ah Er, [phonetic transcription] Ah San, Ah Si, Ah Wu, Ah Liu, Ah Qi, Ah Ba, etc., as their names. Although these indicate their birth order, adding the character Ah to the name seems somewhat boorish and lacks any particular meaning. The Suzhou maids employed by Shanghai families are generally called Ah Jin Jie, Ah Qiao Jie, Ah Bao Jie, Ah Wu Ah Liu Jie, etc. These fragrant names in the soft dialect of Wu are relatively more alluring. Moreover, Suzhou is a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, endowed with unique spiritual energy, so talented people emerge and outstanding scholars abound. In other rural areas, women come to Shanghai as maids, calling themselves "Sister Something, Sister Something." However, the elegant names of ladies and gentlemen in all walks of life are gentle and refined, and also carry some artistic flair. Just look at the signatures of many famous novelists from the Wu region, and you can see their romantic and unrestrained style. As for the names of comrades from Jiangbei, they have a different style, such as Xiao San Zi, Xiao Si Zi, San Liu Zi, etc., truly embodying the saying "having a son makes everything complete." And the chattering Chongming friends use Yi Lang, Xiang Lang, Fu Lang, Jin Lang, etc., generally using the character Lang as the standard. Chongming friends are, after all, sentimental and righteous, with everyone calling each other Lang, which sounds very affectionate. Most Ningbo people's names also start with the character Ah, such as Ah De Ge, Ah Shun Ge, Ah Fa Ge, Ah You Ge, Ah Xiang Ge, Ah Gen Ge, etc. The addition of the character Ge in the middle seems very gentle and carries some sentimentality. I once visited Shengze Town, which belongs to Wujiang County. The names of the men there are all Guan, such as Xiang Guan, Shun Guan, Ming Guan, etc., while the women use Bao, such as Feng Bao, Lin Bao, Gui Bao, Zhen Bao, etc. Hearing it over and over, it's all men being officials and women being treasures. This is how customs differ from place to place, and local customs and conditions and dialects cannot be the same. Therefore, it is no wonder that there is no hope for national unity!</p>
<h3>Speechless with Grief</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>When the ship arrived in Shanghai, it was still dark. My heart was really pounding! I never wanted to stay in the dim cabin again, but at the same time, I hoped that dawn would come more slowly so that I could linger for a while. I loathed the cabin's gloom, but I felt even more acutely the pain of seeing my sick father. This was like a condemned prisoner awaiting execution, who, on the one hand, loathed the tedium of prison life but, on the other hand, hoped that the time of execution would be infinitely delayed. I stood on the deck and watched countless passengers rush like a flood toward the dark pier, the noisy shouts filled with the joyous emotion of "We've arrived!" This sound shattered my melancholy spirit, and I suddenly thought that I would soon see my father! A moment of joy flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>I jumped on a streetcar to my eldest brother's house. I didn't dare go directly to my father's residence. I knew that my father wouldn't want me to take leave to see him because of his illness. Seeing me would definitely upset him, as he would think his pain was getting worse. This is the typical psychology of a sick person, and my father, who suffers from extreme neurasthenia, would be especially sensitive to this. Although my father's illness had not yet reached the most dangerous stage, it had reached the peak of pain. His mouth was so numb that he couldn't speak, his hands were so numb that he couldn't write, and his upper body, except for his left hand, was completely immobile. Although his mind was clear and his understanding was sharp, his ability to express himself had disappeared. Although his appetite was still the same as usual, his ability to digest and chew had been taken away. What a painful illness, and it had to fall on my father, who was most afraid of pain! My eldest brother, sister-in-law, and nephews had all gone to my father's place. Only our old servant was at my brother's house. He told me in detail about my father's condition in bed, and he couldn't help but burst into tears. After a while, my eldest brother came from my father's place. Seeing him made me both sad and happy. The instinctive words "Brother" were choked in my throat, and a stream of hot tears rushed from my eyes. I didn't dare look him in the face, and I turned away to look at something else. He didn't say anything either. A desolate silence suffocated the entire room. Bearing a heart filled with grief and sadness, I finally went with my eldest brother to see my father. On the way, I tried my best to dispel all the evil and illusory thoughts and bravely moved forward. Crossing the threshold of the house, my legs unconsciously weakened, and I couldn't help but cry. My mother also cried, and my aunt also cried. First, the old servant went to tell my father that I had come because school was on holiday for a memorial day. So I wiped my eyes and quietly walked upstairs to my father's sickroom. My father was lying on the sofa chair facing outwards, pretending to be talking to someone with gestures, but the gestures he made ultimately failed to be understood. He finally sighed and wearily lowered his hand. I suppressed the sourness in my heart and, pretending to be happy, seized the opportunity to rush in front of my father. "Dad, school had a few days off, so I came out for a visit..."</p>
<p>Father caught sight of me and jumped in surprise. His upper body suddenly moved forward with force, trying to get up, but he couldn't. His lips trembled, trying to speak, but he couldn't. He stared at me with all his might, and tears that were about to run dry wetted the corners of his eyes, drop by drop. He raised his only active left hand and pointed at me repeatedly, indicating the meaning of "Why did you come?" After a while, he pulled me over and hugged me, my face nestled in my father's arms. Alas, my emaciated father was even more emaciated. I felt some pain from his tightly grasped hand. My father's hands were all bones! Looking at his kind and serene face, I felt that I was immersed in divine love, that I was the luckiest person in the world, and that I would never leave my father's embrace. Wasn't it so? Vigorous vitality seemed to be shining on my loving father's face! Father suddenly pushed me away. However, in an instant, my thoughts were interrupted by my father's heavy sigh. Five, seven.</p>
<h3>The Three Types of "Lords" in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The "Lords" mentioned here are not called so because they are rich, but because their snobbish colors and nameless authority are indeed almost the same as those "Lords" of the imperial examination era. Therefore, in the eyes of Shanghai people, everyone recognizes these three types of "Lords." In conversation, people often casually say "So-and-so Lord!" The three types of "Lords" mentioned here are "Tea Boy Lord," "Toilet Pourer Lord," and "Police Lord." Although these three names can be considered new terms in the Shanghai dictionary, I think readers have long been familiar with them. Enough small talk, let's get down to business. Let's talk about these three types of "Lords" below.</p>
<p>(1) Tea Boy Lord</p>
<p>Let's start with the Tea Boy Lord. Shanghai people call male servants "tea boys" instead of "servants," which is already somewhat peculiar. Being a tea boy is just being a servant, so what's so rare about it? You should know that if you become a tea boy in a political organization, you are truly very impressive! Does someone want to visit an official? Going by car may not offend you, but if you go on foot, that tea boy will have already looked down on you. His face will be like an iron plate, and sometimes he will even refuse to let you see the official, and even if he goes to notify the official for you, he will always roll his eyes, walk slowly, and seem unwilling to bother for you. If things go wrong, he may scold you for being a country bumpkin. At that time, although there will be nameless fire rising three feet in your heart, you must bear it because whether you can visit the official or not depends partly on the tea boy. You cannot offend him, so you can only swallow your anger, as the saying goes, "Calling a beggar but not taking a stick, suffering the dog's anger!" These tea boys naturally have the air of lords. Next, let's talk about the tea boys in schools. They obey the principal's orders without question, but when it comes to teachers with lower positions, they always act "dead as a log," "rolling their eyes," dead or alive, unwillingly. Their air is truly not small. General teachers and students can only call these tea boys "Lords," naming them "Tea Boy Lords."</p>
<p>(2) Toilet Pourer Lord</p>
<p>The "pour" here is not the "bad luck" pour, but the "pour the toilet" pour. In our hometown, pouring the toilet is the sole responsibility of women, but in Shanghai, it is done by men. So if you come to Shanghai for the first time and see men pouring the toilet, you will be very surprised! These toilet pourers also have supreme authority, so the people of Shanghai call them Toilet Pourer Lords. When the sky is fish-belly white and the silk factory workers are going to work, it is the time when the Toilet Pourer Lords take office, pushing their dung carts and running rampant on the streets, just as urgent as fire trucks, shouting "Make way!" Fortunately, there are not many pedestrians on the road at that time, otherwise someone would be run over by the dung cart every day! When they arrive at each alley, they knock wildly on people's doors, "Bang! Bang! Smash!" shouting "Hey!" "Hey!" "Toilet!" "Toilet!" waking up all the mistresses, wives, young masters, and sons in the whole alley from their good dreams. The maids and housekeepers at home hear the shouting and knocking of the Toilet Pourer Lord every morning, and, afraid of the cold and the wind and snow, they get out of bed in a hurry to send the toilet out of the door, because the Toilet Pourer Lord walks mercilessly. If you don't go out, he will pass by, and please let your dung rot. If there are few toilets in the house, they will not be able to rot, so you can only send them out quickly. Therefore, these Toilet Pourer Lords are even more impressive, knowing that no one can do anything to them and can run rampant in the streets and alleys to their heart's content, shouting loudly without any scruples, truly having supreme authority!</p>
<h3>To the Saint of Love, Mr. Liang</h3>
<p>Mr. Liang,</p>
<p>I am a comrade who loves to read this journal. Of course, your great works, sir, will not escape my attention. Even the announcements you put in the newspaper, I have seen, and the earnest wording has made me deeply recognize your noble personality.</p>
<p>This is probably due to differences in personality? Therefore, after reading your work, the title "To My Wei" especially caught my attention. After reading your great work, in addition to admiring your literary talent, I felt not only sympathy and indignation. Indeed, when reading your tender and sad letter of advice, I also shed a few tears of sympathy, especially when I read</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>these few sentences with a bitter meaning, "My dear, come back!" It pained me even more.</p>
<p>If a person, when not lost to their nature, read such a sincere letter, I think they would definitely sympathize with you, sir. However, at this time, Miss Wei, who is intoxicated with love, might even despise you, and even use this letter of advice full of tears as a topic of conversation after they are drunk. Mr. Liang, I advise you to strive for your future.</p>
<p>Even if this letter of yours can move her small heart, I don't think she will be willing to come back. For the sake of your reputation, to consider her loss of love, I say that she probably doesn't have the courage to throw herself into your arms again. This is my personal thought, and I don't mean to insult Miss Wei's character. Of course, I am even more unwilling to continue to mock Mr. Liang. Indeed, my sincere desire is that Miss Wei, after reading your letter, will return to your arms, and, very meekly, confess her past faults to you, and relive the love of the past with you. Mr. Liang, you will not misunderstand me, will you? If you can give me an unexpected comfort in this journal when you regain Miss Wei, of course, this is what I hope for most. Finally, Mr. Liang, please allow me to shout loudly with such sympathy: "Miss Wei, come back! Your Liang cannot live without you!"</p>
<p>Sincerely, Yi Hua (June 12, 22) (Thanks are declined)</p>

<h3>Is it Acceptable to Become a Son-in-Law?</h3>
<p>Editor Sir,</p>
<p>I work as a clerk in a large store, with a salary of only twenty dollars. Although my circumstances are difficult, I can still maintain my own life. I am twenty-four years old this year. When I was nineteen, my parents arranged a marriage for me, but I was not satisfied and dissolved it this spring. Now...a friend introduced me to become the son-in-law of the Yi family. I have also met the other party and am very satisfied. Unfortunately, my family does not agree because of the loss of the family name! Thinking about it this way, I am truly in a dilemma! Also, will there be any impact on my reputation? Please give me a good answer in the shop employee correspondence column. Respectfully, Huang Baohe</p>

<p>Editor: A person's surname is just used as a representation; if you can care for your parents as you do now, then what harm is there in changing your surname? Nowadays, there is a group of people who, after marrying a wife, often treat all the members of their family as strangers. Even if such a person's surname is not changed, they will disappoint their parents even more than changing their surname! Speaking of the true meaning of marriage, cooperation between both parties is the principle; there is no question of who marries whom. So what's wrong with being a son-in-law? As long as the other party is indeed the person I idealize.</p>
<p>However, the son-in-law system has a very long history in China; mentioning a son-in-law often makes people think of "the man having to submit to the woman." The woman's parents will definitely regard the son-in-law as a forbidden item; they will not even allow him to interact with his biological parents and relatives like an ordinary daughter-in-law, which will make a blood-spirited husband feel a little unbearable. This point should probably be stated in advance.</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (II)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(2) Meizi, are you crying again?</p>
<p>The foreign woman was originally a Japanese woman of good charm, but sometimes when her face fell, she could not hide the shadow of the bitterness of enduring the storms of life. Today, she was happy to have rented out the two large rooms upstairs, and this month she was finally not afraid of the panic of having vacant rentals. However, Ah Zhen came during the day and said that she wanted to rent even the small room in the attic and wanted Mr. Li to move out, which made her enthusiasm fall into the ice and made her feel very uncomfortable. She wondered how to deal with this matter. Lihalov naturally agreed that Mr. Li should move out so that he could collect more rent. So she looked somewhat moved at the already sleeping Lihalov|her husband. His beard like coarse bristles was black all over his chin, and his clothes were often untidy, but Oxi wore a pointed hat with red and yellow stripes at home, which symbolized his stubborn and strong personality. The two of them met a few years after the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, she was only a little girl of five or six years old. She had always lived in the Northeast, and her father and brother had both sacrificed themselves for the Yamato spirit in the war, but no one noticed this little Meizi, who had become lonely and helpless because of the war, making her unable to help but follow this Lihalov, the enemy of the Yamato spirit, to live. At that time, Lihalov was still a burly young officer and was very sympathetic to Meizi's background! A kind of human compassion that transcended racial concepts finally made him resolutely take her back to Russia. He was indeed a key general in the Russo-Japanese War and had always been an admirer of the Tsar until, after the October Revolution, he fled to China under the imperial wings of the Tsar, from the north to Shanghai. The vicissitudes of life turned him into a useless person, and all the heroism of the past was worn away. Now, although he is still middle-aged, he is already in the state of mind of an old man. Apart from relying on the memories of the prosperous Imperial Russia and fantasizing about the revival of Imperial Russia, he is completely isolated from society and mankind. The friends and relatives of the past have all scattered and there is no news. Meizi has even less of what is called "acquaintances." So the lives of the two of them are as dull and lonely as they can be. Looking at Lihalov's sleeping posture, Meizi certainly felt a kind of shared suffering, but Lihalov's rigidity and stubbornness could not help but arouse in her a kind of helpless boredom. The youthful vitality of Mr. Li in the attic often brought her infinite comfort, and this comfort had taken root in her heart. But now the loneliness of this night left her alone in the desolate wilderness of thought. She unconsciously shuddered, wanting to sleep, but sleep seemed to be looking at her with a crying face, so she picked up her pipa and gently plucked it. Playing the pipa late at night was almost her habit, as if infinite sadness and infinite melancholy could be played from her weaving fingers. The gentle sound of the pipa dissolved her soul, making the night a more mysterious and nostalgic thing. The doorbell suddenly broke the gentle rhythm that was like a groan, and she went to open the front door. A rich fragrance permeated from the cold of the night. The Third Concubine had returned from a drunken dance, followed by the sound of high heels, which rang melodically to the second floor.</p>

<h3>The Oddity of Garbo is Actually Like This: There is an Advisor Actively Behind the Scenes</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's oddity is considered meaningful by people all over the world. However, many believe that she was not inherently so eccentric, and that someone was secretly advising and designing for her. Now, her mastermind advisor has finally been discovered.</p>
<p>Garbo's advisor is also a figure in Hollywood, named Robet Reudc. He is of Swedish descent and grew up in the Caroline Islands. Many say that he spent 20,000 gold dollars when he first met Garbo. At that time, Garbo had already gained a position in Hollywood, and Robet greatly admired her, so he tried to meet her. As a result, Garbo indeed became friends with him, and gradually he became Garbo's protector and advisor. Garbo's actions are initiated by him.</p>
<p>Robet's demeanor is indeed somewhat like Garbo's bodyguard. He is now thirty-four years old, with yellow eyes, black hair, and a short mustache on his upper lip, projecting an extraordinary presence. Once, Garbo went to New York for fun, and the outside world found out. Reporters and many people who wanted to catch a glimpse of her true face were lying in wait, preparing to congratulate her, take photos of her, and make her speak when Garbo arrived. But in the end, Robet, acting as a vanguard, protected her, allowing Garbo to escape safely. Robet is extraordinarily careful with Garbo. In parks or other public places, he takes care of Garbo as if he were her personal servant. Whatever Garbo wants, whether it is food or supplies, he personally goes to purchase it. People in Hollywood do not understand what Robet is to Garbo, and some even think he is Garbo's servant.</p>
<p>Garbo relies on Robet's words in all her actions. Once, a Broadway stage invited Garbo to perform, and Garbo had already agreed, but Robet advised her not to go, so Garbo listened to him and did not go. According to people in Hollywood, Garbo was originally the most talkative person, but since she was protected by Robet, she has become a strange woman in Hollywood, with unpredictable whereabouts. After Garbo returned to Sweden, Robet followed her to Europe. Now Garbo still follows Robet's plans. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has discussed with Garbo, asking her to return to Hollywood, Garbo had agreed and then regretted it, some say that this was also Robet's idea.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Hell Below"</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>The first film shown at the opening of the Grand Theater was technically excellent. The evening before yesterday (the fourteenth) was the first day of the opening of the Grand Theater. The first film shown was a newsreel, which was plain and unremarkable. A charcoal drawing with very good music, which could arouse the interest of the general audience. A color film, although not novel, was still acceptable. "Hell Below" followed.</p>
<p>The story is very ordinary, telling of an American captain who falls in love with the commander's daughter, who is the wife of a naval aviator. Soon, the captain, driven by "Hell Below," rashly used a submarine to bomb the enemy's warship. Although meritorious, he was expelled from the navy because he did not receive the commander's orders. Later, the captain disguised himself and ran into the navy, persuading the commander's daughter to love her husband, and confessing his past mistakes to the commander. He was reinstated and established a great achievement in destroying the enemy's naval port, but he himself sacrificed his life as a result. Can this story be called tragic? To fulfill the couple, he sacrificed his lover; for</p>
<p>To protect the country, he sacrificed his personal life. Under the cry of advocating "militarism," how brave and loyal was the captain? The film is also encouraging people to fight imperial wars for cities and lands. However, I don't quite understand the captain's death. If he sacrificed himself because his lover already belonged to someone else, using this as a sacrifice of love, and using this to seek fame and praise, then his sacrifice of a useful body was even more meaningless, and this death was "lighter than a feather."</p>
<p>The director is not bad. Although there are large sections of love and a lot of comedic interjections, the whole film can still be consistent from beginning to end, without laziness, and everywhere makes people feel the intensity, tension, and tremor of the war. The segmentation is very tight, and it can be said that the whole film is flawless. I think the photography is the most satisfying in terms of technique. The magnificent scenes of "heaven and water indistinguishable" are fascinating. Several shots taken at the bottom of the sea, with "iron halberds sinking in the sand" and the wreckage of warships and broken ships, and many strange fish as moving scenery, and the use of mercury lamps to illuminate the bottom of the sea, are indeed unprecedented. It is truly commendable that the photography light can cooperate so well. The night scenes are also quite commendable, with various warships arranged in formations. The dialogue is mediocre, but the sound of artillery fire is clearly audible, adding a lot of tension. The makeup and props are all top-notch.</p>
<p>Robert Montgomery, who plays the captain, has very good expressions and deserves the honor of being a first-class superstar. However, in this film, he is always cowardly and does not look like a heroic hero. We cannot blame him for this, because his personality is not suitable. The girl is Madge Evans, representing a typical American woman who is obsessed with vanity, which is just right. She does not work much in the whole film, but she is considered the most outstanding. Walter Huston, as the commander, is calm and experienced, and does not lose the identity of a general. The other actors who play the roles of naval officers are also watchable. Jimmy Duiante, with a big nose, plays an important role in the interjections, describing the life of the naval kitchen, making people laugh. In short, this film is a very good pastime for the bourgeoisie, especially for those foreign soldiers in Shanghai, who will feel it has a special interest.</p>
<h3>Review of "A Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>If we grasp the economic basis of love in real society, then the theme of "A Modern Woman" is relatively realistic. But how does Ms. Ai Xia, who is both the screenwriter and the leading actress, express this theme on film? To explain this, we must first narrate the story:</p>
<p>A female employee of a real estate company, in order to "stimulate" her own needs, passionately loves a reporter with an insufficient income in addition to drinking and having fun. Although this reporter is already the father of two children, she still uses physical exchange. She steals a huge amount of money from the company manager to satisfy her lover's daily needs. But soon she goes to jail for theft. However, the protagonist, the female employee, finally cannot get her lover's understanding, so the dream of love is shattered. The explanation reads, "Ahead is a bright road, go, the sea is wide and the sky is vast."</p>
<p>From the understanding given to us on the screen, it can be clearly seen that the screenwriter's thinking is contradictory. Generally speaking, Ms. Ai Xia does not praise the existing economic institutions. What she hates most is that money destroys love. Therefore, the protagonist initially believes that as long as love can be "thoroughly" intoxicated, she can give up everything else. In the end, she also discovered the "emptiness" of this kind of love. But what is the foundation of the love between the protagonist Tao Tao and Yu Leng? He is already married and still loves his wife very much, especially since he does not have enough money. Does she love his affection? But he did not give her a good impression. Although the subtitles say that she and he have not seen each other for three years, presumably there was love before; but this cannot be replaced by subtitles instead of pictures, and Tao Tao in the pictures is so dissolute that few people would believe that she can be so loyal to love. Does she love his beauty? True, many socialites or prostitutes often love pretty boys, but this protagonist must have a lot of money from many sources in order to let him squander it at will, even if she "pays back" several, she doesn't care. However, Tao Tao is just a small employee, so her love with him cannot exist at all. As for the final transformation, it is also very reluctant, although we do not deny that possibility. However, this kind of woman with a strong personality is rare on the Chinese screen. However, such "thorough love" does not have any benefit to Chinese society.</p>
<p>Regarding other aspects of technique, then the director's Montage in the editing of the screen is still clear. The lead actor's boldness in performance is unprecedented on the Chinese screen; passionate kisses, crazy hugs, and explicit love scenes: although this is not a good stimulus for the audience. The set designer turned the small employee's family into a very wealthy mansion, which is also the director's mistake.</p>
<p>However, some of the audience will be very happy to see this film, and this is the "success" of the film.</p>
<h3>News of Bibi Daniels after Arriving in England</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>The star who recently went from the United States to England is Bibi Daniels and her husband, Ben Lyon, and their daughter, Barbara. Her first British film is named "The Man She Wanted," which is about a multi-faceted love story in which an actress is pursued by three men. The director is Paul Steino. It is said that she will have to change at least twenty-one of the most colorful outfits in this play.

However, it is said that both of them have the possibility of continuous contracts.</p>
<p>A great benefit for them after arriving in England is that they can save the bodyguard they hired to protect their daughter all day long. According to Bibi Daniels, there are about five hundred spies hired as bodyguards to protect their little babies in Hollywood!</p>
<h3>New Soviet Films Arrive in China</h3>
<p>— Tai Kang</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's great production of this year, "Shame," has been screened at the Mi'ao Cinema in that country. The film is recognized by Moscow critics as the most beautiful sound film in the Soviet Union. As a result, the film has won a huge government bonus. The film is a work depicting how Russians "are" rather than "should be." The directors are two advanced directors, Iranler and Ketwitz. The actors are mostly famous actors. It is said that this "Shame" shows the speed and characteristics of the progress of Soviet films in terms of both consciousness and technique. It is heard that the film has come to China and is currently being checked by the Beijing Inspection Committee.</p>
<h3>Film Novel "Love Sea Returns to Waves" (3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by ReunionVienna Zi Gui</p>
<p>American MGM produced, directed by Franklin, starring John Barrymore and Diana Wynyard. Elena said very kindly to Po Fa Luo Mo, "Yes, Po Fa, what do you want to say?" "Elena," he said, "I understand your intention to suddenly change your mind very well. You think that the group of people attending today are all"</p>
<p>They are ruined and bored people, just like myself. They need your participation, which can give them some happiness and some comfort. But I'm afraid you'll have some unexpected adventures today!!" "What do you mean by that?" Lu Que shouted.</p>
<p>"I got a piece of news this afternoon," Po Fa Luo Mo said quietly. "This news is not allowed"</p>
<p>to be announced to anyone except Elena. Elena, I think I should let you know this news before you decide whether to attend or not." The Earl jumped up and said, "Is it Rudolf?"</p>
<p>Po Fa Luo Mo nodded, "Yes, he set off from Nice, Italy, yesterday afternoon to Vienna."</p>
<p>"Can they let him in?" Andeng also joined in asking. "No," Lu Que said suddenly. "They will never let Rudolf in. He is the most dangerous member of the Habsburg imperial family. No matter how stupid the police are, they will never let her in." Elena gasped and said, "Whether he can come or not, I will never go." "But, Angel, Lu Que is right, how can he come in?" The Countess pleaded. The Earl also continued; "I beg you, Elena, we ran all the way from London. We can't lack you. Only you can restore our past mood. Our only life is also in some memories of the past." Elena decided not to go. Not only did she not go, but to their surprise, she reprimanded them. She said, "This is too meaningless. What is memory? Why do you live on things that no longer exist? This is probably the reason for your ruin and decline. What kind of get-together is this?" They were caught off guard by Elena's exposure of their problems. Although they knew that Elena's words were true, they still felt that they had made a fool of themselves, so one by one, they said goodbye unhappily. Andeng watched coldly from the side. When they were all gone, he walked towards Elena and said, "I think you should still attend their gathering."</p>
<p>"What?" Elena jumped up when she heard this. (To be continued)</p>
