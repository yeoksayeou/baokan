<p>當此世界一切商品生産過剩之際資本主義列强之所覬觎於吾國者實爲此廣大之消費市場足以消納其過剩之商品以故消費市場之控制實爲對付列强最有效之方法頻年以還吾人之對日抗爭雖亦以經濟絶交爲利器但所缺憾者則致力之點僅爲消極的抵制而尚少積極的組織即所謂提倡國貨運動其方法及步驟仍嫌其虚空而散亂倘能更進一步集鉅大之資力以組織一全國消費協社以國産爲中心而以蘇聯産品補充其不足在對蘇貿易局指導之下向蘇聯訂購大量必需品連同國産以廉價分配於一般消費者更有不足則向其他與吾友善之列强購取之若是則不獨對日抗爭將於經濟上收得極高之效果即對列强間之折衝亦可以購買問題作有效之手腕也</p>
<p>雖然以上所云均以對日能策動反帝的民族革命爲前提倘人民對日抗爭之銳氣仍將因日人砲艦之威嚇而須加以取締苟且偷安之妥洽政策仍無急劇之變更則組織云云政策云云均成爲紙上空談而已</p>

<p>將來的戰爭到底要變成怎樣的形態、不用說我們都知道一切的東西都是進化的、戰爭也是從古代到現在、非常進化過來的、在原始時代的戰爭、戰爭的主體大槪以一人爲中心、、或以一族黨爲中心然而因社會逐進化、戰爭的主體也漸擴大到民族·部落·都市·或國家、又古代的戰爭祗限於國民一部分、尤其是少數人主張用武力來作戰、所以戰爭的終局都是歸諸中心人物的倒敗、或一族黨的滅亡、或部落·都市·國家武裝團體的敗亡但是自普法戰爭一八七○丨一八七三年以來、特别表現着進化的狀態、即法國軍幾乎完全被德國軍所破滅了、野戰軍雖然都被潰滅、但是甘别太在以後所集合的義勇軍的兵力據說有二百五十萬、這就是表現着在這個時代、野戰軍雖被破滅、但是如果國民仍具有繼續戰爭的强大意志時、尚可爲國家而戰其後雖然也發生了淸日戰爭和日俄戰爭、但是這並不算是徹頭徹尾的打戰、可以說是戰到中途而告終的、所以没有表現了所謂國民戰的形態、如果在那時候、日本打敗了必定再集義勇軍、來繼續作國民的决戰、至於世界大戰、更不用說、幾乎全歐洲都參加了戰爭的狀態、其進化的足跡有歷史可以作證、就是在原始時代、戰爭是一人對一人的狀態但是因社會的進化、戰爭也逐漸變成種種的形態、如普法戰爭可以說是全國民之戰、而世界大戰可以說是國力之戰如果將來再有戰爭的話、我以爲這個未來戰和世界全部的政治·經濟·交通·運輸有非常密接的關係、所以戰爭的發生、與其說是像淸日戰爭和日俄戰爭那樣一國對一國的軍戰狀態、不如說是數國對數國或一國對數國的複戰狀態、由此看來在未來之戰、兩軍所用的兵數、應該要比較過去的戰役增加的因此軍需品也應該需要更多的、並且前面也說過的、交戰的方法也大爲變化、終於變成了所謂國力之戰所以當兩國作戰的時候、把敵國國民的繼戰意志打消這也是算入在戰法之中、那麽、如果要把敵國國民的繼戰意志打消、應該用甚麽方法呢、那是有許多的方法的、舉一二例來說、就是由宣傳來打消軍隊或國民的戰勝信念、這也是一個方法、並且眼前飛機很發達、從遠處用飛機運一噸炸彈、向政治中心的東、京或經濟工業中心的名古屋·或北九州方面擲炸、這又是一種方法、或仍用飛機擲炸工業都、市以計畫破壞其資源、這一種計畫破壞資源的事、也是一種交戰的方法其他如德國對英國所採取的飢餓政策或經濟封鎖的手段、也應該算做一種重要的交戰手段、最近某國（指蘇聯）竟發出將來的戰爭無戰線的言論實際上當打戰的時候、要用子彈來對陣、所以没有戰線的戰爭是没有的但是某國的交戰手段却是這樣的、一方面在第一綫作戰、同時擴大戰綫、自第一綫的後方、以至於殖民、地敵國國内用種種的方法消滅其武力、或引導其革命、誠然某國採用這樣的交戰手段、也許是可能的、從這樣看來將來的戰爭巳經不是綫的、也不是平面的、而是立體的、而地域方面又由戰塲而擴至國内、關於軍隊的裝備方面、在世界大戰時、德國使用毒瓦斯由暗中攻擊、使英軍大敗反之、英國又利用坦克車攻入德國軍内、使德境懸危、如是兵器由戰爭而作非常的進步、今後新的兵器勢必應時而産生的、並且這些兵器都要使用大量的鐵的、到了最近、使用大量毒瓦斯材料的傾向、也很顯明的表現出來了、我們來看看各國所努力的兵器、就明白其所看重的、就是航空機的充實、化學兵機的發達、和鎗砲威力的增加、因爲要補救這些、對於光學的·電的·精密機械的智識兵器、都盡其研究的能事、並且以各種汽車來代替馬匹的機械化兵團、自數年前就發現於各國如是觀察將來戰爭的形勢、無論從那一方面看來、都需要大量的鐵、都需要大量的軍需品、這是很顯明的、日俄戰爭兩年間日本軍所發射的砲彈爲百五萬發、在瀋陽一役兩週間日本軍發射了三十三萬發、然而在世界戰爭的馬爾乃一役一週間、法國軍發射了百萬發即日俄戰爭二年間日本所使用的砲彈、法國軍祗在一週間就發射得乾乾凈凈了、又在蘇力姆一役二週間法國單用了二千萬發、而英國軍用了千四百萬發、如是把這許多的鐵量落在敵陣地、單就這些砲彈來設想到底這些工業在戰時、應該要在何處製造、這種疑問勢必立即發生的、在日本的陸軍、不過祗有造兵械廠而已、在這裏當然造不出多量的東西出來、所以終非利說民間的工廠不可的、這祗單就子彈來用的、但是被服·糧秣·也應需要莫大的數量的、其他如衛生材料·獸醫材料·也需要相當的數量、把這些東西在官設的工廠製造終究是不可能的、一時要把能力擴大的事、在短時期内是辦不到的、因此、勢必須使用民間的工廠、其他關於原料究竟要怎樣採取、並且製品如果造好了、又應該用何方法積貯於何處要把這些怎樣輸送、其他要想起來必定更有種種的問題發生的、這些問題應該在平時解决的、到了戰事爆發纔來準備、那是勢所不能的、所以要從平時準備的、作這種準備的計畫、我們呌做軍需工業動員</p>

<p>國民新聞社云前國民政府外交部長陳友仁日前申論美國有協助中國之義務與責任付中外各報發表後昨又撰文闡發滿洲間題與印度未來國防之關係普告印度民衆請其一致抵制暴日原文如下</p>
<p>日本企圖破壞向來維持中國領土與行政完整之國際制度對於印度尤其對於印度國民大會亦有重大關係蓋英人之於印度始之以征服繼以歷史演進之力變而爲保管員之管理迨此保管任務完畢必有退出印度之一日况際此勢將變更全世界現有社會秩序之革命變化的壓力之下事變日亟英人之放棄印度統治爲時當不在遠及其一旦實現則保衛印度防禦侵略問題隨之而起在於昔日侵略印度者或自西北方踰陸而來或自西方越海而至但至今後印度獨立一旦實現統治此半島之眞正政府移入印人掌握則陸上之危險祗有邊境蠻族之侵擾用少數高等機械化軍隊以精銳航空隊爲主力足以應付而有餘惟海上之危險則遠爲可畏屆時已非復來自西方而將來自東方受日本海軍勢力之威脅蓋印度自英日同盟一九零五年第一次賡續與一九一一年第二次賡續後即正式入於日本海軍勢力之躔道迨後以印人抵制英貨與中國抵制日貨結果日本在印貿易有驚人進展於是日海軍勢力與印度之關係遂愈益根深蒂固而不易破除中國爲抵抗日本武力侵略滿州實行抵制日貨並因中國購買日貨即供給日人征服中國戰事之經費不啻自殺其抵制日貨亦爲救國所必要之圖但日本所受中國抵貨之損失方圖取償於印度今日印度市塲之於日本其重要已無異於中國市塲寖將在日本工商經濟上占極重要地位一若滿洲之被稱爲日本生命線而將印度稱爲日本之另一生命線亦非事勢之不能或有者由此以觀日人之稱霸亞洲大陸對於印度亦將有中國所遇之同樣危險因膸</p>
<p>至屆時防止印度工業發展使不致阻碍日本之完全開拓印度市塲將爲日人之重要利益惟是日人計劃他日之獲得印度支配權當然無意於移殖其過剩人口因印度已無供日人居住之曠土故其圖謀印度之主要目的全在他日占據印度市塲之完全專利權阻止印度成爲工業國俾印度所自造者即在本國市塲亦不致與日貨相競爭假令日本今日征服中國之戰爭竟得成功則俟他日英人放棄印度统治後可以獲有侵犯印度之軍事優勢與物質富源（觀於印度市塲在日本工業上之必要此舉勢所難免）諒印度之民衆尤其國民主義之印度民衆必能了然於滿洲問題與印度之自由安全實有重大關係在也倘印人准日人侵其市塲以便利日人之征服中國中國必將蒙受致命之災禍但中國今日受殃則印度明日亦將同蒙其害苟印人能與中國合作共同抵制日貨即令此舉足以紓緩印人之抵制英貨（按在實際上此舉今已不復爲印人促成獨立之必要手段）而將來危險降臨之日行將有强大之中國感印人此日之相助自旁協攻日本侵略印度之陣線也此舉實與印度全國有深切之關係爰是申請印度國民主義份子經由國民大會運動印度民衆確實了解日本對於亞洲之威脅並請共同肩負政府工作之其他印人在議會内提出日本侵略問題以其足以影響目前經濟之安全與未來之國防視爲印度當今切要之圖此則我中國人民此日之所企盼無量者也</p>

<p>吳凱聲演講</p>
<h3 id="c120">國際形勢及我國方針 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>一方維護條約一方收復失地</p>
<p>吾與各國聯絡一致始可對日</p>
<p>國聯秘書吳凱聲昨日下午在上海民衆敎育館演講今後我國應取之外交方針及我國應付日本退出國聯後之外交華東社記者特記其詞於下</p>
<p>國際外交之分類中國自閉關時代至現在國與國之間發生關係國際間之交涉因以發生國際所取方針一係遠交近攻日外交取之故近攻中國遠交歐美至歐州各國政策則取近交遠攻之說最近之英首相麥克唐納與意首相墨索里尼之會晤討論下列問題修改凡爾賽和約一對德軍備平等二對歐州以外各國之殖民政策取一致趨向蓋即遠攻近交也</p>
<p>外交政策之趨勢國際間之外交初趨向於同盟如戰前之法比同盟德奥同盟英美同盟等惟因同盟而遂發戰爭旋至一九一四年巴黎和會舉行由美總統威爾遜氏主張組織盟使全世界各國携手而弭戰事如有一國之侵犯其他一國者衆出而干涉之但自中日事件發生後各國又感到聯盟政策之失敗於是外交趨勢又由聯盟而入於同盟矣如最近之英意聯歡等</p>
<p>外交政策之形勢外交形勢向分四派（一）大陸派（二）英美派（三）歐美以外之諸國派（如俄土日等）（四）南美派在陸派由法國爲盟主如歐州羅馬尼亞等數國均入其掌握中意大利因法之覇視歐洲極爲不安故助德向法修改歐戰和約意又鑒於因助法勝德而獲利益於是亟望德法兩派再圖一决雌雄俾意可解决其土地之發展但法國不能不維持其在歐之地位故鈎心門角擬把持歐陸因而意法風雲可隨時爆發在歐洲如是之環境中當然無暇顧及遠東問題其對中日事件僅須表示而已至英美派之英美兩國本係同種在歷史上不分彼此雖有時因情感上有所衝突顧其對外之權利同趨一致現英日之所以同盟英固欲藉日獲東亞利權日亦欲藉英以制美今則不然蓋美極顧慮日在太平洋上之爭覇故與英積極聯絡美國遠東商業上之權利不及日不能與日交惟日如日迫不得已時未始不能攻日助華也至歐洲以外各國派包含俄土埃印等國土耳其新興後與俄極爲接近俄之與華原係隣國其在遼吉利益殊不願由日獨占惟其五年計劃尚未完全成功兼以受歐洲各協約國之控制甚力故不敢單獨貿然與日戰爭此則須視吾國如何而定如我國决心抗日則俄國必能助華印度埃及兩國雖因地理上之關係與華疏遠但究係同爲被壓迫民族自然與華同情此外爲南美洲派該派距華甚遠兼以近年來有内亂關係故除道德上可帮忙外事實上實無可主張惟吾國亦應注意因以後在南太平洋之商權固與吾國不無關係也日退國聯後之烏瞰日本退出國聯後外交形勢由合而分換言之以前之外交係合的外交今後之外交係分的外交惟日方亦因感於退出國聯後外交之孤立於是設法補救派使英在使赴日荷美等各國游說得各國外交之帮助但無論如何對國聯盟約第一第三兩條規定（即於二年内仍須服從國聯盟約規定）仍須遵守故將來國聯與日本之直接衝突即係對於南太平洋之諸島之代治也（Ｍandat）該代管之諸島是否將交國聯國聯是否將交德國均成問題</p>
<p>我所取外交方針處於此種恶劣環境之下我國之外交方針當然一方面維護國聯條約一方須積極進行收復失地世界各國是否因情勢之關係而爲吾國援助此則我國外交當局亟須研究之一個問題如目下有助我者則日本前途必歸失敗</p>
<p>我國將何以對日我國將何以對日乎惟有聯絡世界各國最要者美與俄次則英甚至德意亦須聯絡因美之不願日在太平洋握覇權心理正與我國相同必能助我俄國與遼吉極接近遼案發生必須俄出來講一句公理中俄裂痕雖有然中俄日俄之間則俄必與華同情英意兩國各願其在遠東商務上佔一席地亦願與華爲友德素以機器鳴於世如能聯德對於軍事上必有直接間接之利益</p>
<p>造成大戰者乃日總之在現在世界形勢之下收復遼東如和平方法無效則惟有訴之武力如不幸而正式宣戰則吾國犧牲因在而日之犧牲將更大將來造成世界在戰當然由日負責吾在中華民族一方須抱收復東三省失地之志一方須爲世界之分理人道而奮鬥</p>

<p>丨復本埠徐先孚君來信丨</p>
<p>答：足下屢次來書·﹁皆以民族大衆爲懷，凡所論列，自忖較自殺，戀愛，職業，遺産等問題，實勝一籌。﹂誠然誠然！所以我們答覆足下，也就不厭求詳，然以本欄篇幅所限，還未能盡其十一，致勞足下反覆申說，不過理愈辨而愈明，事愈析而愈精，足下肯滔滔致辯，固記者所歡迎；然統觀最近兩書，當中應當討論的實在太多，兹擇其要者數事再與足下一商榷之。</p>
<p>（一）前函說﹁本是我一時的感慨，﹂</p>
<p>而三月十四日之函又說﹁我第一封信的感慨是經過以往積累的﹁感，﹂而發生一種强力的﹁慨﹂，﹂這種感慨旣是積累而成，便不是﹁一時的感慨了，﹂豈不是有點矛盾嗎？感慨在先，研究在後，這種事實，容或有之，然只限於簡單而易感覺的事物，若足下的長篇大論，並列舉一些統計及徵引許多史實，這便不是單純的感覺，乃是在相當研究之後，才有這種﹁國家存亡民族興衰的觀念﹂。我們并非忽視感慨，乃是感覺到足下所言的後矛盾，且不脫中國文人夸大舊翌；明明是用心寫的東西，偏要說，隨便寫的；明明是研究過的（至少是相當的研究），偏要說······﹂，這種態度，我們以爲不可，故爲足下言之。至於你的引經據典，大半文不對題，費希特告德意志民衆書·雖因耶拿一役之敗衂，用熱烈的情感發表出來，然而却不是如足下所說的﹁一時的感慨，﹂費希特是當時的大哲學家，繼康德而起，平時對於國家興衰，民族存亡之道，必已研究有素，適於適當時機，發表他的極有價值的歷史文書，而足下拿來做爲一因一時感慨，拉雜寫下······﹂的辯護，誤矣！</p>
<p>（二）足下的第一信說：﹁西洋的文明······一是供給的力量，一是支配的力量﹂，第二封又說：﹁資本主義與社會主義的分野，只在一個支配的力量，又說：﹁資本主義與社會主義的差别只在指導人類進化的方面的力量，﹂其實社會主義與資本主義的區别，不但在於支配的力量，也在於供給的力量，就足下對於﹁供給的力量﹂所下的解說：﹁所謂供給的力量，是發明人們智識和技能，控制了自然，爲人類進化的原料的生産·········﹂，簡單地說，就是控制自然。不錯，在資本主義社會中要控制自然，在社會主義社會中也要控制自然，然而在資本主義社會中的控制自然與社會主義社會中的控制自然，有量的不同。因爲資本主義不能盡量地利用科學，物質，利用大多數人的聰明才力，所以社會主義的控制自然的力量，更超越資本主義的控制自然的力量，即更多的發展﹁供給的力量﹂，量的不同發展到一定程定，便變爲質的不同。所以到了社會主義完成以後，人類的唯一要務就在征服自然，即控制自然。所以我們研究資本主義與社會主義之區别時，而忘却社會主義控制自然力的偉大，即是說，忘却牠與資本主義的一種差别，結果，必然要失却牠的一半眞實内容。不然的話，資本主義的社會，固然是要控制自然，即在封建制度的社會中，何嘗不要控制逢然？一隻輪船，一架飛機固然是控制自然，一隻木舟，一架騾車何嘗不是控制自然？所不同的，只是因量的差别，到了一定程度隨變爲質的差别，因而　就做了資本主義與封建經濟之一種差别。以彼例此，異地皆然，足下只看見資本主義對於自然支配的力量，而未暇細究其辯證法的變異，遂忽視　在社會主義與資本主義的差别上的偉大作用。列寗曾說過，社會主義就是無産階級當政加電氣化，蓋有深意在焉。固然資本主義社會也利用電氣，然在社會主義必須盡量地利用，由量變而爲質，此其所以不同也。</p>
<p>（四）我們根本上並不反對靑年，而是要問是什麽一種靑年？觀足下﹁輿論倡，靑年導，勞苦羣衆踐之，革命乃得觀成，﹂把靑年特立於勞苦羣衆之外，其意若曰，只有現在受了高等敎育的人，才可以領導革命，勞苦羣衆不過服從命令而已，這完全不　得，革命民衆的文化程度，不能拿學校的敎育做比例的。</p>
<p>（五）我們所說的資本主義與社會主義是指經濟組織與社會組織而言，所以我們可以說，資本主義的經濟與社會主義的經濟，又可說，資本主義的社會與社會主義的社會，或資本主義的國家與社會主義的國家。我們所說的社會主義，是近代資本主義社會的産物，而不是柏拉圖的什麽共和國。他們一個天上，一個地下，毫無一點相同，萬不可混爲一談。現在的社會只有兩個前途，一個是資本主義的社會：一個是社會主義的社會，找不出第三條道路，而足下竟把﹁社會政策，法西斯主義及理想的reohnocracy等﹂拉在一齊，並列起來，寶在牽强。社會政策乃是資本主義國家中採取一種社會改良主義的政策，然而他的政治環境，經濟組織仍然是資本主義的，如畢士馬克竊取當時社會主義學說中關於工人運動的要求之一兩點，改頭換面，這就是他的社會政策。至於法西斯主義只是資本主義到了末路的一種最後的掙扎，他的社會仍然是資本主義的，因爲牠們更加緊壓迫勞苦羣衆，他們不能不爭奪市塲：他們不能不爭奪殖民地，分割殖民地。墨索里尼的意大利是如此，希特列的德意志也是如此。</p>
<p>（六）足下說﹁馬克思唯物史觀以爲資本主義進化至自然傾覆時期，無産階級勢力增大，共産社會主義乃得實現﹂，這樣新鮮的馬克思的唯物史觀，記者淺見得很，實在不曾讀過這樣的馬克思的理論，我記得梁啓超，似乎有這樣的見解，他在大戰終結，從歐洲回國以後，批評唯物史觀曾有這樣的話，說，唯物史觀旣然說，資本主義發展到相當時期，一定要崩潰，那我們就等着他崩潰好了，何必還要革命呢？其實這是躱懶主義，命定主義，而不是馬克思主義，不是唯物史觀。資本主義社會不是﹁自然傾覆﹂的，必有待於人力的摧毁，才可以一面送終，一面催生。更奇怪的，你說﹁列寗的蘇俄已非馬克思所理想之共産社會，﹂這眞錯了，列寗的蘇俄，並非就是共産主義社會，你在什麽地方看見列寗說過蘇俄就是共産主義社會。你的錯誤是在於：一·不知道無産階級專政與共産主義社會的分别：二·不知道馬克思所理想的共産主義社會與他用以達到此種社會之過渡期間的社會形態丨無産階級專政的階段。今試以語我來；馬克思所理想的共産主義社會是怎樣一種社會；他敎我們怎樣達到這種社會？列寗的蘇俄又是怎樣一種社會？</p>
<p>（七）所謂民族自决者，乃是關於國家之加入某一國家聯邦與退出某一國家，各民族有自决之權之謂，而不是說在一個聯邦之内，關於聯邦政治都要各民族自决。足下没有分淸這一點，宜乎誤認聯邦行政的憲法條文爲干涉民族自决，這實在有意地吹毛求疵。老實說，我們研究理論，認淸事實，上天下地，任其所之，什麽都可以。不過我們批評蘇聯時，自已也該有一點反省，蘇聯共和國之下的各民族爲世界﹁民族自决﹂的眞正典型，足下試讀一讀杜威遊蘇聯後的回憶的描寫便可瞭然，最後，我還要奉勸一句，足下實在是現在中國大學·至少是上海各大學中一個好學的學生，書也看了一些，但是没有頭緒，思想因而混亂。最好先讀幾本理論的書，把思想方法弄得淸楚點，然後便不至這樣東裏一句，西裏一句。然而我還要重複一句，足下實是現在大學中一個好學生子！</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>在這年頭兒，南方人不甘服務於僞國的都先後回里。有一位閘東歸客，在嗟歎聲中談起東北未亡以前的一輩缺乏常識不知世界大勢的貪官汚吏·</p>
<p>東北官吏只理會得對外謟媚，對内搜括，其他一切普通常識是没有的·有一位高級官吏，他號　是東北官吏中比較頭腦清醒的人；　熟了秘書預擬的稿件，也會滔滔不竭地在壇上演說。一天，舉行慶祝紀念，外賓席上有許多領事官來觀禮。他又要登壇演說，寶弄他的拿手奸戲了。他不用秘書擬稿，只爲，他最近看過一本小册子，認爲絶妙的演說資料，便大膽地演講世界大勢了。</p>
<p>他又怕外賓不明瞭他的妙論，不能出足他十二分的風頭：便吩咐譯員同時在壇上譯成西語以博碧眼人欣賞。他有一段妙論：﹁一日千里的世界文明愈演愈進步了。從前空中戰爭，要用巨量的炸彈去轟炸敵方陣地；現在英國　新式飛機，只須在一個小小玻璃瓶中向卜界倒下一些睡藥，便可使敵方十里以内的兵士個個酣睡四十八小時，失却戰鬭力而束手就縳。﹂</p>
<p>他下璮後，英領事首先問他：﹁不聽得敝國有這倒睡藥的飛機，閣下此說何來？﹂他說：﹁這是載在小册子裏面的，有書爲證·﹂英　事只是微微一笑。後來，他把這事告訴秘書，秘書問他根據什麽小册子？他說：﹁二十一世紀的空軍。﹂秘書笑道：﹁這是一本預測百年後空軍的理想小說，如何作證？﹂他睜圓着眼道：﹁現在不是二十一世紀麽？﹂秘書說：﹁現是二十世紀，至少須經六七十年才是二十一世紀。﹂</p>
<p>高級官吏紅漲着紫膛色而皮，牢閉着這張蓄着德國式髭鬚的嘴半晌不作聲。</p>
<h3 id="c193">打出天下 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>打出天下﹂這句話，在我們蘇州地方，父傳子，子傳孫，一直至於曾孫末代，也不知有若干世的歷史了。所以我認爲不拘甚麽事·惟有﹁打﹂，纔打得出天下，惟有﹁打﹂，纔有出路我記得從前我們鄰居家裏，有一個女兒，同時姘識着二個少年。有一天，二個少年碰巧遇到了，你也磨拳，我也擦掌，一言不合，竟拳來脚去的各拼個你死我活。大家亂打了一陣，一個雖打得汗流氣喘，一個却已打得頭破血流。這分明是汗流氣喘的朋友勝利了，頭破血流的朋友，怕挨第二頓打，只得把情人放棄。於是勝利的那朋友，便毫無顧忌地獨佔着那女孩子。這就呌做﹁打出來的天下﹂。</p>
<p>再舉一個例。譬如大小老婆奪一個丈夫。大老婆不許丈夫到小老婆房裏過夜，小老婆也想把丈夫獨佔。起初還不過大家冷言冷語的說說。後來逐漸地你駡我不要臉的堂客，我駡你爛汚的娼根。這樣還不能解决，於是不得不出於最後一着，比一下子誰潑。假使結果下來，文質彬彬的大老婆，給粗脚大手的小老婆把房間傢生打得粉碎之外，頭髮拉掉了一綹，臂上咬去了一塊，那麽，眼看着丈夫給小老婆覇佔了去，獨個兒受用，除了五千遍搗枕槌林，也末有甚麽辦法。因爲小老婆究竟是﹁打出來的天下﹂在這世界上，不拘處在怎一個環境裏，假使想要站得住脚，不吃人家虧，便不能不存着﹁打出天下﹂那條心。儘坐在家裏望着天嘆氣，望着地跥脚，正合了一句蘇白，呌做﹁踱頭﹂，因爲﹁天下﹂是靠自己去﹁打﹂出來的。</p>

<p>當你要想同伊Kiss的時候，你一定要徵求伊的同意，而且我相信伊一定是拒絶的，最好你知道伊不致拒絶，而你可以先試試伊的意思，然後再有所表示，這樣伊的眼會告訴你，伊願意接受了！</p>
<p>要使伊愛你，你的舉動應該活潑些，但是不要太滑了，因爲這樣會使伊非但不愛你而變成怕你了。</p>
<p>觀察一個女人是否有愛人，在求愛的過程中是很重要的。在這裏，我告訴你一個法門：假若你看伊目光平視，那是没有愛人的象徽；假若向上，不但有，而且很滿足，向下呢？對你有幾分意思了，不，至少是在等着你去愛伊。</p>
<p>如果您怕離婚，請你就不要結婚。</p>
<p>假使伊的年齡比你大，你千萬不可以呌伊心愛姊姊，你應知趣地稱伊親愛的妹妹。</p>
<p>告訴伊一個漂亮的女鄰舍搬　走了，往往會使伊非常歡喜。</p>
<p>不要相信伊，雖然伊表面是非常莊嚴，而且時常駡天下没有一個好男子，但心裏却希望着有人來追逐伊，當你碰到伊向你說獨身主義的時候，伊就是告訴你：這是向伊進攻的時候了！</p>
<p>如果遇到伊駡你的時候，你應該歡喜，因爲這是伊對你愛的表現！</p>
<p>假使你愛上了伊，在可能中，你不應該使伊知道你在愛伊，因爲伊知道後，時常從得意中題現出了驕傲。</p>
<p>袋裏的﹁阿四匹靈﹂應該時時預備好，如果你同伊出去，袋裏袁世凱丨洋錢丨閙荒，在還不得已的時候，拿出藥片來，對伊說：﹁唉！我頭痛得利害！我要回家一次！﹂這樣一定會發生效力。</p>

<p>第三回終負解鈴心登門鑄錯暗憐丫角願推食分</p>
<p>趙自强道：我剛才由城裏回來，看到淸眞館子裏搬出一大盆牛肉來，十分新鮮，我就想着買兩斤您來嘗嘗。反正比城外駱駝肉充數的强。說着在趙翁面前，提到高高的，笑道：您賺，這不很新鮮嗎：您願意怎樣吃：我給您配作料去。天要下雪了，給您切薄片兒，來個涮鍋子吧？趙翁笑道：咱們家短少那套傢伙，勉勉强强的吃，少趣味。再說，我也怕吃了不消化。趙自强道：這倒說的是，我去買兩個大蘿蔔來，把牛肉煨着吃吧？趙翁摸了鬍子，笑着點點頭。於是趙自强自己到廚房裏去切牛肉，呌聽差小林去買蘿蔔。小林走到前院來，他又從後面追着來，喊道：小林，買蘿蔔留心點，别買凍了心的，凍了心的，老太爺不吃。江氏在屋子裏聽到，就向桂枝道：趙連長對他們老太爺眞好，遇事都想個週到，我要有一個兒子養活着找，不想當什麽連長隊長，只要有趙連長這一份兒心，我就死也甘心了。桂枝道：這年頭兒男女平等，作兒子的，可以養老，作閨女的，一樣也可也養老，你信不信？我决計養活你這一輩子。江氏歎了一口氣道：你有這番心也不成，你到了人家去，人家還要拿一半主意呢。桂枝答道：什麽人家拿一半主意？您聽着，您這一輩子，都歸我養活了。我陪着您過活，决計······决計······姓楊一輩子的了。江氏道：爲着什麽呢？桂枝道：我不說了嗎？爲着養您呀！趙自强站在院子門邊，聽了這些話，心裏想着，不由得點了兩點頭。然後回廚房去切牛肉。把菜做得停當了，就走到趙翁屋子裏和父親閑話。趙翁道：蘿蔔煨牛肉，小林還不曾作呀！你在營裏，整天的忙着，回來還不好好兒的休息。（三一）</p>
<p>婦女樂園</p>
<h3 id="c197">婦女座右銘 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>有些不熟識或未經正式介紹過的男子，他們來和你結交約會，你不要引以爲幸事，因爲他們不過拿你來取快作樂罷了。你如果認眞　他們來往了，他們便當你是一個十分愚妄而粗心的女子，連敬重也不來敬重你了。他們要是眞的來娶你，那除非世界上只有你一個女子。</p>
<p>幸福的結合，是夫婦間都承認彼此不同地方的存在，他們只曉得相互配合互助，並不存心消除這種不同。這是最正當的方法，因爲丈夫妻子原來要互相補足而成一體的。毁滅夫婦幸福，破壞家庭結合的，不僅是經濟等重要的問題，這是很覺不幸的。常常因爲一些極小的問題，大大的影響到婚姻生活的安寗。過於認眞過於多話的男人或婦女，都能損及家庭幸福的。</p>
<p>新時代的婦女旣不是寄生虫也不做依附者。伊就是做了妻子母親仍是繼續伊的職業。如果伊丈夫的收入不夠家用，伊就賺錢來以供補助。伊如果嫁給了一個有錢的人，伊也不肯因此依他過活不求自給，變做一個無足輕重的閒散婦人。伊要做自食其力的完人不願做寄生的妻子。</p>
<p>舊式家庭是消滅了，這句話是的確的，但這不過因環境的革新科學的進步，産生了新式的更好的家庭來，代替了舊式的罷了。我們所目擊的不是家庭的毁滅，乃是家庭的進化。不過婦女得了發展能力的好機會，才可以促成它的進化，婦女所負於人類的使命，没有比建設愉快美滿家庭一回事更高尚更神聖更重要的了。因爲充分完美的家庭建設，必須要有受過了敎育的能幹女子才能做到。</p>
<p>有位著作家說：﹁因爲處理那種旣少用處又不美觀的裝飾與家具，不知浪費了婦女多少時間；這種浪費的時間，伊們很可以節省下來，用在體力的鍛鍊，智識的培植，精神的修養上面﹂。新時代的婦女，絶不因珍奇的裝飾無用的家具而枉費伊的心力的。伊具有偉大的人生目的，很能活動於公共的事業，而此家庭中也更加顯出興旺的精神。爲妻爲母的人而愈有智識敎育和經騐，伊必能做一個更有成功的家庭創造者。</p>
<p>你時常責備你丈夫，他當然要發生反感的。丈夫如果也這樣的待妻，也會發生同一的結果。有個意志卓越的婦女，嫁給了一位容易犯些小過失的男子。因爲伊愛好伊丈夫的緣故，所以自從結婚以後伊就天天的督促他。起初伊就找尋他的差誤；呌他什麽應該做，什麽不應該做；對於他的舉止言行處處嚴加批評。這位男子很尊敬他的妻子，時常設法使伊快樂，起初總是承受伊的意旨依了伊的話做去，但後來他不能耐煩了。他的好性格反而給伊弄壞，從此變成個容易發怒抑鬱不樂的人。他們的結果害得雙方的生活都苦痛。他不但不被伊感化，反而怨恨伊的多管。他對於妻子的情愛都給伊消滅無餘了。</p>

<h3 id="c198">說妥洽 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>英國約翰，毛萊（JovnMoeley）的妥洽論，實際上是鞭撻時人的不妥洽論，而中國的對日不妥洽，實在却是最徹底的妥洽。一讓，再讓，三讓，而東三省，而熱河，而·········這還不是妥洽是甚麽？因看到了中外名實的相反，所以來說一說妥洽。莊子曰，名在實之賓也，大哉言乎，中國人的優根性，就在此矣。</p>
<p>却說妥洽之由來，因爲如此這般，貓貓虎虎，箇人就可以從中得利。某執政因妥洽而做了皇帝，某將軍因妥洽而得了地盤，某先生因妥洽而鞏固了自己的權位，借得他人的力量，成就自已的素願，國家於我何有哉，百姓於我何有哉，這不是妥洽之功用又是什麽？</p>
<p>在中國，并且非但人是最愛妥洽的，就是正直無私的神道，大抵也是愛妥洽的。小時候看到的社戲裏的百壽圖，那位短命鬼，居然會因一餐酒食之力而加添了壽數。人死了，只須上城隍廟裏去多燒些紙帛，鬼也爲貪了賄賂之故，會減輕牠們加於死人的毒刑重罰。所以多行不義的中國紅人，往往去修廟進香，壓榨窮苦階級的洋塲財閥，每又是好施樂善。慈善風行，罪障消滅，而小百姓乃愈來而愈苦，這又是中國的天道神明愛妥洽的反響。</p>
<p>這些原是大人先生們中間的妥洽，但在我們小百姓之間，却又不然了。窮人和窮人，每會因一錢之故，而相駡，而相打，而喪失了性命。窮鄉僻壞的居民之愛打官司，喜因細事而械鬥，暫且按下不說，就以上海街頭而論，一日一夜，在細民的中間，偶因不相干的一句話，或一舉動之故，而惹起的明爭暗鬥，呌駡殺傷，眞不知有幾十百起，結果倒便宜了巡捕房裏的先生，弄得生意興隆，財源茂盛，這又是不妥洽之害也。</p>
<p>如此說來，則我這短文的結論，自然是﹁由此觀之，可以人而不妥洽乎﹂了。</p>
<p>小學敎師H·Barbusse作李靑崖譯天氣很熱。我們聽見蜜蜂飛，又看見牠們成羣在火熱的空中波動。行人小心地躱在那一行灰色房子牆脚邊的影子裏走。這是西班牙的山旦兌爾省的伽瓦打村的廣塲上的景象。這村子和西班牙大多數的村子是相似的，並且也和西班牙法蘭西兩國交界那帶地方的村子相似。從前這地方景物固然比現在更有畫意，不過現在也並不弱，而嶺峻民愁的西班牙的神秘的枯燥意味，正籠罩這帶地方。</p>
<p>除了蜂羣的嗡嗡之外，另有一大陣含着單調韻律的喃喃之聲從那行牆裏竄到外面來。這是村裏的小學。小學的内部，是和全世界的小學内部相似的。牆呢，是暗晦的，嚴肅的丨丨也許小學的硬殻，要到社會換了自己的硬殻才有人去換牠；許多成行的黑的桌子，許多小的腦袋，那也都是黑的，不過是圓而且方；當中，一個立着的人儼然是個偉丈夫，這就是小學裏的敎師了。</p>
<p>他也像全世界的那些同業者一般，展開他的不凡的巧妙和忍耐，來導誘來集中那三十個小腦袋的注意，並且設法向那些腦袋裏面，把現實界的大觀多少裝入若士。</p>
<p>伽瓦打的村立小學敎師，名呌拔爾多美羅，姓佐里。他是一個安詳簡單而又和藹的人，各方面都說他是盡心服務的。在這村子的小範圍裏，他的不苟且的態度早已被衆口同聲所共認。倘若他偶然遲到，大衆就會用斷定的口氣說：這是鐘出了毛病。</p>
<p>因爲他在思想之中，也同他在生活之中一樣守着正直的態度，於是他的思想就不能呌一切的人都表示滿意，尤其是他那些含着連帶責任的和合作的意味的思想，並且有些人竟說：這是一個赤黨。不過即令那些在自己心裏，那些在奴性的可憐心裏，因爲一個人同時可以做赤黨而又正直以致詫異的人，也免不得對於佐里加以贊嘆。</p>
<p>然而伽瓦打的兩個要人，兩個穿黑袍子的人，本村敎堂的堂長和堂副，却不是這樣想了。他們一樣痛恨這個小學敎師，儘管他們除了他之酷愛自由和公共幸福之外，絶不能彀加以譴責。</p>
<p>這兩個敎士監視這所小學，這本是製造那個接踵而來的後一代人的思想的工廠。所以倘若他們不願意讓將來的世界從他們掌握之中逃出去，自然應當把這工廠抓在自己的手裏。</p>
<p>十多年前，有一個姓非雷名呌佛郎息司戈的人，本想把西班牙所有的小學，都從敎士們的氷凉暗晦世界裏面解放出來。結果他被西班牙政府槍斃了。當時，那些槍彈不等他喊完最後那句在他視爲畢生最高口號的﹁小學萬歲﹂之前，就破碎了他的身體。（未完）</p>

<p>— 光默</p>
<p>人之所以異於禽獸者，多一衣冠而巳。此外並無多大差别。</p>
<p>據說，狗是象徵着義的。狗主人把殘羹賸飯，肉皮肉骨喂些給牠吃，那麽，踢牠一脚，打牠一下，牠非但不動怒，還會把尾兒不住的搖。馬是象徵着忠的。馬主人施一些稻草梗兒給牠吃，那麽，儘把鞭子在牠的背上抽，牠越是没命的駝着主人跑。至於蜜蜂象徵服從，螞蟻象徵着團結，也儘人皆知。所以古代的帝王與提倡王道仁政的大儒良相，最愛把這些，那些禽獸倫理學，加以忠孝節義，三綱五常的解釋，以示典型而資激勵，說得明白一些就是說，要做人，須學禽獸。要學得像禽獸，纔算是人。在這世紀裏，我們儘可不用望遠鏡與顯微鏡，隨處都可找到像狗一般義，馬一般忠，蜜蜂一般服從，螞蟻一般團結，提倡王道仁政的大儒良相理想中的﹁人﹂。這我們不得不謳歌古聖先賢的努力，激勵贊揚得這一世紀的人，竟像了禽獸，而造成了這一個世紀的文化。</p>
<p>從以上禽獸象徵人的理論，那麽，人，不成問題，也就可以象徵禽獸。倘使這個二等邊形，不背乎邏輯，那麽，人即禽獸，禽獸即人，而成爲人獸一體。但是，人，究竟是人，禽獸，究竟是禽獸，因爲人究竟是多了一套衣冠。</p>

<p>— 樂愛</p>
<p>大衆的戰爭，雖然還没有打倒那些存貨的國貨的大王，然而已經像潮水似的湧上來。尤其是﹁子夜﹂所描寫的時期，是有一陣洵湧的浪潮，後來才暫時退了些·這種浪潮時時刻刻激動着，從這裏推到那里，卽使有些起落，而衝破一切的前途是明顯的。那些﹁狗﹂用盡一切手段來鎭壓，這個浪潮；假裝着吉阿德老爺式的﹁國貨奮鬭，﹂不過是這些手段之中的一種。</p>
<p>無論是吳蓀甫，無論是老趙，是周仲偉丨這些種種色色的大王，城裏的，鄉下的，都在提心吊膽的隄防着。像馮雲卿那樣的地主，他不能够不躱到上海來做公債，以至出賣自己的女兒，睜着眼睛看自己的姨太太不三不四的胡閙。而上海雖然比較穏當，也在成天的閙著工潮，國貨大王在睡夢裏也没有一刻安寗，時常夢見工人推翻他的﹁寶座。﹂這對於他們丨互相吞噬着的他們丨當然不是什麽理想我天堂。他們，連並不留戀古舊的鄉村生活的﹁工業家，﹂都要和﹁營長切實辦交涉，要他注意四鄉的共匪；﹂他們又要鈎心鬭角的對付工入，想要﹁一網打盡那些壞傢伙。﹂他們﹁身邊到處全是地雷？一脚踏下去，就轟炸了一個！﹂···他們的﹁威權己處處露着敗象，成了總崩潰！···身下的綱絲軟墊忽然變成了刀山似的。﹂是的，他們的前途是没落，是滅亡，雖然總崩潰還不是目前，雖然刀山上的刀尖還没有截穿他們的咽喉。在他們的周　盤旋着的，固然也有個把屠維獄，存點兒小軍師的手段，會用一些欺騙的挑撥的圈套，不過他也始終只能够﹁加派一班警察來保護工廠。﹂而屠維嶽之外，還有些什麽人材？空談的大學敎授，吃利息的高尚詩人？寶劍和鐵腕？連自以爲是鋼鐵似的吳蓀甫本人，也逐漸的暴露﹁色厲内荏，﹂說不出的懦怯，悲觀，　廢，没落的心情。</p>
<p>從另一方面來說，那些五年前參加五卅運的智識靑年，現在很有些只會﹁高坐大三元酒家二樓，希望追踪尼祿（Ｎero）皇帝登高觀賞羅馬城那種雅興了。﹂</p>
<p>所有這些，差不多要反映中國的全社會，不過是以大都市做中心的，這是一九三○年的兩個月中間的﹁片段，﹂而相當的暗示着過去和未來的聯繫。這是中國第一部寫實主義的成功的長篇小說，帶着很明顯的左拉的影響（左拉的﹁Largent"﹂丨﹁金錢﹂。）自然，牠有許多缺點。甚至於錯誤。然而應用眞正的杜會科學，在文藝上表觀中國的社會階級關係，這在﹁子夜﹂不能夠說不是很大的成績。茅盾不是左拉，他至少己經没有左拉那種蒲魯東主義的蠢話。</p>
<p>這裏，不能够詳細的研究﹁子　，﹂分析到牠裏所要指出的，只是中國文藝界的大事件！﹁子夜﹂的出現丨很滑稽的和所謂國貨年碰在一起。一九三三年在將來的文學史上，没有疑問的要記錄﹁子夜﹂的出版；而這一九三三的﹁國貨年﹂呢，恐怕除出做﹁子夜﹂的滑稽對照以外，絲毫也没有别的用處！本來，這是﹁子夜，﹂暄紅的朝日没有照遍全中國之前，那裏會有什麽眞正的國貨年。而到了那時候，這國又不是﹁大王們﹂的國了，也不是他們的後臺老板的國了。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>海泉遲疑了一下没有回答。李一香只當海泉是不相信他有那樣的神通廣大，能夠勾通Ｓ社的總部人物。其實這是一香觀察錯了。海泉想，能夠認識Ｓ社總部的人物與否，有什麽重大的關係呢。一香這句話不單和革命無關，實在不合羅輯。一個靑年，丨丨這縱不算是封建思想，至少也可以說是英雄崇拜的思想，而這兩種思想都是革命之敵。</p>
<p>﹁······因爲那個宣，宣，宣，傳部長程君是我在南歐留，留，學時的一位好友，我可，可，可以左右他，可，可，以左右他。·········你如果想加入Ｓ社當正式社員，一定要到我這邊來。﹂</p>
<p>海泉此刻才明白了一香的意思。一香是居奇地以認識Ｓ社總部的大人物爲重寶，拚命拿來向靑年眩示。海泉當下便感着革命文學前途的幻滅了。他又想縱令是革命靑年，何必要﹁想會﹂Ｓ社的重要份子呢。自己實在太可憐了，錯認了革命導師了。</p>
<p>臨别時，一香把通信住址告訴了海泉，並叮囑他要守秘密，不可以隨便告訴了人。海泉此刻也只好唯唯聽命。</p>
<p>﹁你有什麽問題不明白的，可以來問我，或寫信來也好我當一一爲你解釋，不問是文學理論問題，革命理論問題，社會科學問題，都可以。······﹂</p>
<p>﹁先生家裏藏書一定很豐富吧。﹂</p>
<p>﹁不。一，一，一，切都是藏在我。我，我，這裏面······﹂</p>
<p>一香指着他的肚皮向海泉說。海泉又覺得一香完全是個書瘋子了。</p>
<p>在黑暗的冰冷的氛圍氣中，海泉和一香握了握手，告别了。</p>
<p>﹁你有，有，有，作品儘管送來。我，我，我，可以爲你設法出版。﹂</p>
<p>海泉聽見後又有些高興起來了。</p>
<p>别了那位革命文學專師李一香先生後，海泉又是一個人在寒風裏顫抖了。朔風刮得很厲害呌號出像日帝國主義的轟炸飛機的音響。他的背項上感着了一陣一陣的冷風襲來。</p>
<p>﹁此刻有十二點鐘了吧。今晚上自己是無家可歸的人了！﹂</p>

<h3 id="c204">推克諾克拉西之理論的解剖徐毓 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>推克諾克拉西這名字，現在眞時髦極了。美國是這名字的發源地，所以美國的報章雜誌，當然充滿了關於此說的討論，就連有聲電影新聞片，也有關於推克諾克拉西的新聞，以爲號召。國内雜誌報章，亦有相當介紹。本文完全從經濟學的見地，研究産生克諾克拉西的社會環境，檢討其思想淵源，從而批判其學說之是否健全。</p>
<p>（一）産生推克諾克拉西的社會環境</p>
<p>美國地大物博，人口比較稀少，又因立國未久，富源尚未盡量運用，所以美國的經濟學家，大都帶樂觀色彩。一百年前的美國經濟學家享利開來，（ＨenryC·Carey）就是非常樂觀的一人。當然，開來氏的理論與推克諾克拉西的理論完全不同，前者承認現世界已漸趨和諧，一切社會衝突現象，如勞資糾紛等，皆可逐漸自行消滅；後者認現社會的生産方法丨丨機械技術生産丨丨與分配方法丨丨基於人力的金元分配方法丨丨矛盾，欲使現社會免除失業等苦痛，唯有廢除金元分配制，而用能力分配制。但兩者有一共通特點，卽對於未來的樂觀。開來氏認李加圖（Ｄ·Ｒicardo）的地租說爲不當，人類不是先耕良田，後耕劣田，反之，而是先耕劣田，後耕良田，所以未來社會應逐漸緊榮；推克諾克拉西派則認現在生産方法已非常發達，祗須改金元單位爲能力單位，社會就能享受眞正的快樂，他們的未來社會是﹁每人每年祗須工作六百六十小時，而生活程度却可高於商業最盛時期之一九二九年﹂。</p>
<p>開來氏的劣田先耕於良田說，完全受當時美國社會環境的影響。其時美國西進運動方熱，良田逐漸開發，人口亦比較稀少，故有開來氏這種理論；這種理論，對於當時情形，固甚適合，但時至今日，因文明日進，人口日繁，已開始動搖。至於推克諾克拉西派的樂觀，是否有健全根據，我們留待後來討論，不過假使没有美國社會那末機器發達，生産持術那末進步，决不會有這種議論。所以我們可以說推克諾克拉西是社會環境的産物。</p>
<p>（二）推克諾克拉西的資本主義内在矛盾說</p>
<p>如上節所述，推克諾克拉西派認爲資本主義的生産方法已進入完全機械時代，而其分配方法尚基於人力，以致消費不能與生産均衡，這是資本主義的一大矛盾。這種學說，看似很新，實則七八十年以前，馬克斯早已講過。馬克斯認爲資本主義的内在矛盾共有物質與人爲兩方面，而物質方面，包括生産方法與生産關係的矛盾，所謂生産關係，就是階級關係，財産關係，換言之，就是分配關係。由是而觀，推克諾克拉西的資本主義内在矛盾說，不是很受馬克斯的影響嗎？</p>
<p>不但在理論綱領方面，推克諾克拉西與馬克斯彷彿相似；卽在暴露資本主義之　結時，兩派口脗亦幾完全相同。推克諾克拉西派認爲機械所有人佔社會中絶少數，而在今日物價制度之下，這絶少數人所獲得的消費力，丨丨卽購買力丨丨遠超過其所能使用者以上，於是祗能以此剩餘購買力，再投之於機械，結果工業機械繼續擴張，産量大增，物價制度下的社會不能容納，進一步卽爲物價低落，資本家無利可圖，生産停頓，工人失業，消費力更减退。據推克諾克拉人說：祗要物價制度不廢除，商業衰頽終無法避免，資本主義崩潰的原因，卽在於此。</p>
<p>馬克斯怎樣說呢？馬克斯認爲資本家的目的在盡量獲取剩餘價值，所以竭力設法增加工作時間。而工人所得的工資，却僅足以維持其家屬及其本身之生存。同時資本家爲獲得更大利潤起見，又以其所獲得的剩餘價值再投入工廠，或增加機器，以增加生産的速度。結果産量大增，而搆成大部份消費者的勞工，其工資僅足以維持生存，無充份消費力，於是形成生産過剩，而爲資本主義内在矛盾之一。</p>
<p>現在我們可以知道推克諾克拉西派及馬克斯關於資本主義内在矛盾說的酷肖程度了。</p>
<p>（三）推克諾克拉西的能力價值說</p>
<p>推克諾克拉西派旣認引起社會失業，恐慌等現象的主要原因在於金元物價制度，則其改革方法，自在取消物價制度。他們認爲物價制度的必要條件爲人力，而人力在今日生産上已不估重要，所以物價制度已成現社會的累贅，阻止工業的繼續工作，减少羣衆的購買力；他們又說金銀是一種不準的通貨，不適用於今日技術文明非常進步的社會，因爲金銀所代表的，不是財富，而是對於工業的一種債務。要改革現社會的矛盾，唯有認淸財富的目的在求社會的福求，財富是能力的産物，其衡量方法，應以能力爲單位，而能力單位的具體形式，卽爲﹁能力券﹂。（EnergyCerlificate）能力券者，基於産生一定商品所必需的人力或燃料消費之能力數量也。消費者獲得此項能力劵後，卽有平等消費的權利。</p>
<p>能力劵一槪念，似甚新奇，與此類似者，則有十九世紀歐文（ROwen）的勞力劵。（Labornote）歐文曾創設勞力交換所，凡持貨物至勞力交換所者，皆依其工作所需時間，給以相當的勞力劵。勞力劵與能力劵略有不同，因爲勞力劵所注得的，是人的勞力，而能力劵所注得的是能力，人力祇在能力中佔一小部份。然而我們很可以說推克諾克拉西的能力劵槪念，是很受歐文的影響的。</p>
<p>（四）推克諾克拉西眞能打破物價制度嗎？</p>
<p>以上我們講了推克諾克拉西所以在美國發生，是因爲美國機械發達，生産技術進步，天然利源豐富之故。它與百年前開來的經濟學說相同，同以美國社會爲背景。又說明他們的資本主義内在矛盾說，差不多是祖述馬克斯經濟學說的一部份，他們的能力價值說，能力劵計劃，無疑是受到歐文的影響。至於他們對於恐慌之消費不足說，經濟學家早已講過，財富之應注重社會福利，又與　布生（J·A·Hcbson）一　所倡的幸福經濟學相類似，但是我們就此可以說它東抄西襲，毫無價值嗎？</p>
<p>這是顯然不能的，任何社會科學的學說，都不能嚴格的說是獨倡的，大都受他人學說的暗示，啟發，而加以融會貫通，我們要討論推克諾克拉西的學說是否健全，我們必須要看他整個理論基礎是否健全。</p>
<p>推克諾克拉西派認現社會的癥結在於物價制度，未免把社會問題看得太簡單了一些。這是因爲推克諾克拉西的人物，大半爲工程學家物理學家，所以談起經濟問題，往往注重人與物的關係，而忽略了人與人的關係。貨幣祗是交易媒介，由人類選爲財富標準，固然，這種媒介對於社會有若干惡影響，然而廢除貨幣制度，决不能解决社會問題之全部。退一步講，卽令物價制度爲社會癥結所在，貨幣不足以代表財富，然而廢除金銀，代以能力劵，物價制度仍然存在。因爲無論交易媒介爲貨幣或爲能力劵，交易比例永久存在，有交易比例，卽有物價，祇是所表示的名義，有不同而已。所以推克諾克拉西的領袖斯高德以爲推克諾克拉西可以打破物價制度，這實在是錯誤的。</p>
<p>（五）推克諾克拉西的基本缺點推克諾克拉西派認爲物價可以廢除，就是不明白稀少的道理，不懂稀少，是推克諾克拉西派的基本缺點。稀少不僅是經濟現象的基本原理，而且亦爲一切社會現象所由發生的主因。假没有稀少，我們便用不着法律，政治，道德。法律所保護的，祇是人民的財産權等，論理所敎訓的，不外如何適於社會生存，政治是爲公衆目的而設的調劑機關，假使一切物品都絶對豐富，人民還有什麽衝突？還何用法律來保護？何用道德來訓誡？何用政治來維持治安？物價之來，卽由於稀少。空氣是絶對豐富的，空氣有價格嗎？</p>
<p>推克諾克拉西派說：﹁消費品稀少時代已過去了，現在的世紀，已不再需要勞力與節儉爲生存於世的條件。······美國天然利源旣富，機器能力又大，必能進入一新文明時代。﹂然而這些僅是空話，没有證明。他們祗告訴我們某麵粉廠用多少人工，出多少麵粉，某汽車廠每日能造幾個車架，某人造絲工廠祇須用一個工人就可管理全廠，卽使這些統計都完全準確，至多亦祇告訴我們生産技術進步，生産技術進步與生産品加多是兩件事。他們并不能證明製造麵粉的麥子增加了幾倍，製造車架的木料增加了幾倍，製造人造絲的原料增加了幾倍，有許多原料是不能以進步的生産技術而無限制生産的。原料旣不能無限制生産，生産技術進步又有何用？又安能﹁每人每年工作六百六十小時，而生活程度可高於一九二九年？﹂</p>
<p>他們又說美國佔世界鐵鑛百分之四十，煤鑛百分之五十，煤油百分之六十九，天然瓦斯百分之八十一，面積十二分之一，人口百分之六强，可以算是豐富了了。不知道這還是稀少，因爲稀少是相對的槪念，卽令全世界利源都集中於美國，亦未見豐富。</p>
<p>現在我們可以下一暫時的斷語了：推克諾克拉西是採集各家學說，如以融會貫通，受美國社會環境影響，乘美國經濟衰頽聲中而崛起的怪物。創此說的人，因爲忽略經濟上的稀少原理，所以主張不免錯誤，現在雖甚囂塵上，不久恐卽歸淘汰。</p>
<p>（註）上述斷語，雖說是暫時的，仍不免武斷。因爲推克諾克拉西派自已做的正式書籍，尚未出版，他們的思想，散見於雜誌報章，然而從這些報章雜誌，已可見其　想的大槪。斷語之是否可靠，留待事實證明吧。三，十日，於上海商學院</p>
<h3 id="c205">論推克諾克拉西林秉中 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>一九二九年秋，紐約華爾街發生大風潮，揭開了世界經濟恐慌的幕，直到今天，還没有一點復興的氣象，而恐慌的怒潮，反日見其增加。經濟家政治家都束手無策，簡直没有辦法來開展這個局面。在這個時期裏面，便有人提出了﹁推克諾克拉西﹂Technocracy的制度來解决一切經濟問題。報紙上雜誌上都竭力宣揚，我國最近也有不少人介紹這個新學說。我個人對於這個制度的確很懷疑，現在先把它的重要意義略述如左：</p>
<p>（一）提倡﹁推克諾克拉西﹂者，以爲世界經濟恐慌及失業問題的嚴重，其起因是在於目前的貨幣和物價制度，這種制度是資本家牟利的工具，所以弄的資本集中於少數人的手中，而大多數人反而没有飯吃。解决現在的失業問題就是使資本不集中於少數人的手中也就是要打倒貨幣和物價制度。</p>
<p>（二）廢除貨幣和物價制度之後，一切貨品，便可以﹁力﹂Enejgy來估量，發行﹁力劵﹂EnergyCertificate以爲交易的媒介物。</p>
<p>（三）這一派人的思想，以爲經濟的基礎是在於機器，所以一切經濟事業都應由科學家管理，由科學家在技術的立塲點上來决定生産的數額，使足供消費而已。</p>
<p>上列三點就是這一派人的主張，我現在就從這三點上來談談我對於這個新制度的意見：（一）我們知道這次經濟恐慌的最大原因，是因爲生産的供給額過大，超過消費額所需要的，於是物價低落，資本家便緊縮生産，淘汰下人，因而形成了目前尖銳化的失業問題。生産爲什麽這樣的膨脹呢？簡單的一句話，就是因爲機器的發達；自從引用機器以後，一般科舉家一天一天的在改進，想盡了種種方法來增加機器的效率，使它能在最短時期内，使最少的人工生出最大的效果。機器愈發達，人工的用途愈少，其他一方面，人口又逐日的增加，於是失業問題才到了今天的地步，這是此次世界經濟大恐慌的起因，所以機器愈發達的國家，失業人數愈多，美國便是一個例子。這般提倡﹁推克諾克拉西﹂制度者，以爲經濟恐慌的癥結在於貨幣和物價制度，因爲有了貨幣，資本家才可以壟斷一切，所以非把它打倒不可。這種主張未免有點捕風捉影，我們知道貨幣是一種媒介物，因爲方便起見，所以用它來購買貨品的，人類的最終慾望並不在於貨幣而在於貨物，因爲有貨幣就可以有貨物，所以才把目光轉移到貨幣的身上，卽使完全破壞貨幣和物價制度，資本家也未必見得就没有攫取貨物的慾望，也未必見得就不能攫取貨物吧？</p>
<p>（二）從前亞當斯密ＡdamSmilh曾主張以﹁人工﹂Labor作爲一切貨品的價值的基礎，他也知道，﹁人工﹂是没有辦法來作精確的估值的，所以又有﹁交易價值說﹂。現在提倡﹁推克諾克拉西﹂制度者，也主張以力來作價值的準繩，這裏所謂的力，當然是人工和機器的力了，那麽﹁力﹂又當怎樣的估值？製造一部汽車所用的﹁力﹂這可以設法測量，敎員的授課又當如何量法，服務也是一種生産呀！</p>
<p>他們又主張發生﹁力劵﹂以購買物品，那麽﹁力劵﹂就可以算做一種交易媒介物了，和貨幣又有什麽分别？資本家能攫取貨幣就不能攫取﹁力劵﹂麽？所以這還不是根本的解决方法。</p>
<p>（三）現在的生産純是機器生産，這是不容否認的，機器的製造和改進都有待於科學家的研究和發明，但是不能夠以爲科學家能發明機器就可以來解决經濟上的一切問題了。經濟事業没有科學家便無從著手，而科學家也未必見得就是萬能的，有了科學便可以摒絶其他社會科學，這一派的人物就是太重視科學家了，他們要逾越自然科學的界限侵人社會科學的範圍，大談其以技術解决最近的經濟恐慌，殊不知自然科學裏面的問題與社會環境截然不同，技術只可以改進生産而難以解决因生産過量物價低落而發生的經濟恐慌。</p>
<p>這個制度方在創立，詳細著作尚未發表，以上只就我所知道的疑惑的提出談談，或者將來他們所發表的論文，能解釋我所疑的一切，那就未可知了。</p>
<h3 id="c206">﹁推克諾克拉西﹂述評良明 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>一切學理的産生，莫非適應時勢的需要，其能受人歡迎及傳播，大多是適應時會。如十八世紀因産業革命而引起的失業問題之嚴重，造成了馬爾薩斯﹁人口論﹂之地位。德意在戰後因經濟重與的要求，乃有法西斯的興起，目下喧騰美國各報章雜誌的﹁推克諾克拉西，﹁也不過是目下黄金國家經濟恐慌的産物。</p>
<p>﹁推克諾克拉西，﹂現在，不但美國的學術界熱中於這學說的研討，就是歐洲各國，也紛紛注意。在將來，它的勢力也許會更進一步，發生較重大的影響，但其内容，就其現有的而論，實甚簡單。</p>
<p>﹁推克諾克拉西﹂是美國一羣科學家所提倡，其領袖爲施高塔（HowardScott）他們組織了一個團體，到北美去研究社會之物質方面的功用，所最注意的對象是生産技術，卽英文Ｔechnology就根據這個字，自稱他們的團體爲推克諾克拉西，成立以來至今已有十二年，所研究的工業不下三千種，作成許多圖案，把北美的物質的功能分析得很淸楚，</p>
<p>推克諾克拉西研究北美物質能力的結果，最近發表了他們的報告及主張。他們以爲，最近三十年來，新機器的發明和自動機的應用，進步絶速，一切生産組織業已技術化。這種技術過分進步的結果，已和美國舊有的經濟制度發生衝突，就是原有分配上之物價制度已不能適應新的技術化的生産組織。最顯着的例于，如世界普遍的失業問題的嚴重，以前以爲可由改進生産技術來解决，現在知道生産技術的改進引起失業問題，生産技術越進步，越將促進失業問題的嚴重了。</p>
<p>但他們並不如初期的基爾達社會主義者或個人無政府主義者，因機械的發明引起相應而來的罪惡，卽憎惡生産技術的改進。他們都相反。他們以爲技術的改進是必然的趨勢，所不對的是現在的物價制度不能和新興的生産技術相適應。他們以爲：以金銀來表現的金融或物價，已屬過去，對於目下的經濟恐慌實無能爲力。一切的社會生活都是受着物理的法則所支配。在物理的法則中，﹁能力﹂（Ｅenrgy）是一切生産及社會生活之源隨技術的進步，貨幣旣屬過去，自應以各人的﹁能力﹂爲標準，來規定分配制度。能力的表現雖有各種形態，但都可以工作的單位來規定能力的大小。由之，發行﹁能力劵，﹂來替代現行的貨幣，便生産技術和工作分配，得以平衡的發展遂不致有今日失業問題及經濟恐慌之弊。如施高塔在他所作﹁技術打破物價制度﹂一文中，便是發揮這種理論。至其詳細的實施方法，則他們還没有發表，其高見如何，尚無由知道。原理上的說明不過如此。</p>
<p>我們並不抹殺﹁推克諾克拉西﹂的影響，不久的將來也許要更形熱閙，但也不必過分重視其實際的價值。有人批評轟動一時，至今餘波猶存的馬爾薩斯人口論說：﹁不過是黨派的偏見使人注意到這本小書。﹂同樣，也不過是因美國經濟恐慌無出路，使人注意到那沉悶中的呼聲丨推克諾克拉西而已。隨社會科學的進步，人類社會關係决非自然關係如物理法則所能比擬，已是不用再辯的事實。</p>
<p>不過這學說對於現在的吾國。也未始没有一些敎訓的地方，便是：技術和社會關係是分不開的，振興中國，並不是靠單純的生産改進所能奏効，反之，美國正在高度的生産情形下受了損害。</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章業務之情形</p>
<p>我們醫界中同人，對於專在醫院服務的醫師，以及醫學校敎授，是看重的，因爲他們得很小的薪金，而做很多的工作，並不想在社會上吸取什麽厚利，足見他們很肯犧牲一己的享用，用走向研究學術一方面去，將來中國一切醫學上的進步，大半靠託在此輩身上。可惜上海市上醫學校，十年來也没有大進步，而醫院還　多數在外國人手裏，這種人物，並不甚多罷了。社會上常常有人以爲極紅的開業醫師，必可在醫學上發明什麽東西，實在愈紅愈忙，適得其反。還有慈善機關醫院裏的醫師，不論他學術如何，我們也得非常鼓勵他，那才將來有人肯爲慈善事業，而終身在醫院服務，現在社會人士對於這二類醫師，最不注意，並且對醫院中的醫師，尤其不表同情，因爲肯久駐醫院中的醫師，個性冷靜，對待病家，容或有不圓到的地方，而我國病人受了歷來鄙醫的催眠，却最喜醫家的趨奉和敷衍的。外國許多大敎授，常用命令式的態度對待病人，在中國是不行的，所以在上海的外國人，尚且迎合社會心理到十二分，而一般富商大賈，最易上當。</p>
<p>上海市上老資格的外國醫師，大都尚稱規矩，學術方面呢，即使當年不甚高明，如今拿中國爲試騐品，也試騐得很好了。不過他們與華人治病，漸漸地有些﹁姑息辦法﹂這就是他們迎合社會心理，而中國通的證明也，是中國自己好敷衍的結果。近十年外國醫師到上海來的大增，因歐戰以後，外國醫學又突飛猛進，因上海洋人的需要，來了一批正式的專家，又因各國醫師每年造就之多，更來了一批並不高明，而專向中國人方面來解决麵包問題的。這一類洋醫來滬開業的步驟，無非一到上海先找他的本國商人，由他的本國商人介紹給他的中國買辦，由中國買辦請吃中國菜，而認識一班中國商人，席間吹牛拍馬，無所不至，中國人怎經得起藍眼睛高鼻子的拍馬呢？自然受寵若驚了。於是再介紹些病人給他治治壞了果然不敢說半個不字，治好了當得五體投地，等到生意一好，診所也大了，洋行裏賒的器具帳也拔淸了，就在上海成家立業，那時原介紹人家庭中有病要去請他時，他往往還要搭些架子，說某軍長請他戒烟。某部長太太請他接生，一時忙不開呢。</p>
<p>最可笑的，我們醫界裏，也有少數人喜歡與外國滑頭醫生合作營業，我不知道稱他狼狽爲奸好呢，還是爲虎作倀妥當？去年冬天，我還和一個俄國醫生，同看一個慢性乳癌據他的主張，說是小毛病，吃幾天藥水就好了。我說頸腺已腫，頭部都受了影響，恐怕不能以局部的癌腫之小而忽之，他似不甚憧，後來病家當然取他那有辦法而又簡單的說程，於是由那俄國人送來二瓶用Eubiosae（一種補品）裝的黑色藥水，而又並不是Eubiose，不幸那病人才服了三天就死了。並不能做那俄國人狠久的主顧，雖然事實是如此，然而我總覺得在這醫藥毫無規則的上海，也許那位俄國醫生，靠着言語隔膜，將來前途還是狠光明的。只有前八年曾經和我打過官司，並且專拿反老還童號召的希米得博士云云，究竟被轟了回去，連某洋行的器械費，好像没有付得淸，他可算外國人裏一個最倒老的了。</p>
<h3 id="c218">淋病難以治愈的理由和正確的治療法（上） <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>報紙上醫藥廣告中最多的，要算是淋病了。電氣療法，注射療法，内服斷根藥，白濁秘方，白濁草等等，眞是五花八門，千奇百怪，但是旣然有了這許多治療的方法，何以還不能把淋病醫治斷根呢，吾現在先把淋病難以治愈的理由，逐一的寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）淋菌的性質淋菌最喜歡存在尿道内，有永久生存的性質，所以淋菌不滅，淋病不治，但是要殺滅淋菌，非用殺菌的方法不可。譬如應用藥物的療法，或是理學的療法，如果用峻烈的方法，雖則能夠把淋菌完全殺滅，但是尿道組織，反受著一種的破潰，如果是用温和的方法，則以又難以見効。</p>
<p>（二）尿道組織的關係尿道粘膜内，本有上皮組細胞的被覆，防止外界害毒的侵入，淋菌侵入尿道内的時候，繁殖發育，尿道粘膜。受着淋菌的襲擊和他毒素的作用，粘膜就發生炎證，上皮細胞被剥脫，這時候病人就覺到排尿疼痛，流出黄白色的膿汁，也就是急性淋病的時候了。但是淋菌不僅侵及到粘膜的表面，還要侵入到粘膜下面的組織内，這樣侵及深部的淋菌，雖一時發生劇烈的炎證，但是不久尿道組織，因炎證的關係，發生變質，更因自己毒素的蓄積，淋菌繁殖力著明减弱，所以尿道上的症候减輕，恰如治愈一樣。實則此時即移行於慢性淋病，治療反更加困難，並且在慢性淋病的時候，淋菌往往潛伏在尿道上的尿道側管，馬氏賣，立氏腺等處，用藥液去洗滌的時候，只能把尿道表面的淋菌殺滅，潛伏的淋菌，遇著了機會，還是要再出來作祟的。</p>
<p>（三）没有理想的治療方法因</p>
<p>爲淋病的難以治愈，雖則有了種種的醫治方法，但是没有理想的良法，就是没有用一種的方法，可以把淋病醫治斷根，現在把所有的療法，逐條的記述在下而：</p>
<p>Ａ内服藥淋病時候應用的内服藥劑頗多，但是没有一種的特効藥，（特効藥就是一種藥物對某病有特効，可以醫治斷根的意思，譬如六○六對於梅毒，白喉血淸對於白喉，金鷄納霜對於瘧疾，這樣都可呌作特効藥。）這是現在全世界醫藥界所共同承認的最多用的是一種檀香油劑，古巴香劑，烏羅透品，美趣藍等一切的尿道消毒劑，和止痛劑，鎭靜劑，消炎劑，止血劑等，　則都可以應用，但是都不能呌做特効藥，並且有人服了檀香油劑，發生胃口不開，惡心，嘔吐，下痢，腎炎等，服了古巴香劑，發生皮膚疹等的事情，所以藥劑是可以應用，惜乎没有特効藥。</p>
<p>Ｂ透熱電淋菌遇着了高熱，可以死滅，但是尿道内要得到這樣的高熱，淋菌還未死滅，尿道的粘膜，已經不堪受這樣的高熱了，所以創始三十年來的透熱電療法，還是失敗。</p>
<p>Ｃ光綫和電氣有人講光綫（如紫光燈）和電氣，可以殺滅淋菌，但是實際上經過了種種的試騐，還未得到學界的公認。</p>
<p>Ｄ苗漿的注入淋菌苗漿的注射，能夠增高身體中對淋菌的免疫力，對於淋病時候的合併症，是很有功効。</p>
<p>Ｅ黄色素注入療法此係一種﹁阿克利定﹂色素劑，有消毒的作用，對於急性淋病有時很有功効。</p>
<p>Ｆ局部治療淋病並不是世俗所講的虚症，腎虧，和濕熱下注，實是尿道内受着淋菌傳染的關係，旣然是局部的疾病，用局部的治療，自然是最重要了。就是應用尿道的洗滌藥液的點滴，但是往往有用了藥劑，反去剌戟尿道，使尿溷濁，炎證加甚的也極多，這時候應當選擇藥劑的種類，用法和濃度等一切了</p>
<h3 id="c219">現社會醫藥狀况的觀察（上） <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>如果有人要問：﹁世界上醫藥智識最普及的是那一個國家？﹂那我可以毫無懷疑的提出一個答案：﹁只有中華民國﹂。因爲你無論跑到什麽窮鄉僻壞，找一個毫無智識的老太婆或老頭子來問：他至少能報出許多許多的藥名和他的用法丨治寒或治熱，解毒或化食。其他掛牌開診的儒醫，世醫，内外婦孺大小方脈，以及賣狗皮膏藥，配百騐靈丹的醫藥專家，更遍地皆是了。</p>
<p>照理中國的醫藥知識旣這樣的普及，而醫藥專家又這樣的多；國民的死亡率較之世界各國應該最低，而結果恰適得其反：這又是什麽緣故呢？要解答這問題，請先來看看一般中國社會的醫藥情形。</p>
<p>在中國社會裏根深蒂固爲在多數民衆所信仰的當然是中醫。以中國這樣大，而文化歷史這樣的久遠；難道會没有一二靈效的方藥精專的醫士？爲什麽中國的醫學，幾千年來老是没有進步？這就不能不談談中醫的根本問題。</p>
<p>中國的醫藥向與命卜星相並舉。以人命所關的醫藥學，他的基礎却築在玄之又玄的陰陽五行上；而一般國民却還趨之若鶩，眞百思不得其解。</p>
<p>因爲中轼的醫藥學没有科學作根基，同時政府對於醫生又没有取締與其他登記的手續；所以無論什麽人，只要認幾個字，能夠把所記得的藥名亂七八糟的寫成一張方，便可以掛牌開診，而不斷的會有人上門來送死。好在中國科學不發達，究竟是病死還是藥吃死的，旣没有什麽可以質證：而我們國民又最是安分知命的，﹁死了便算了這是天命﹂。在這許多劊子手丨庸醫中，大部分可分作二派：一派是江湖派，他們學會了幾句江湖口决，記得了風寒暑濕升降消散幾個口頭名詞，便可以信口開河：這一派大槪醫外科雜症的多。一派是學究派，他們書旣讀不通，官又做不像，要敎書又嫌束修太薄，私塾又在取締之列：要做地方的領袖丨紳士，資望不夠，此外一切的事情更輸不到他做了：没法子便掛起一塊儒醫的招牌混混飯，這又是一派。除了這兩派外，還有由藥店</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>夥友變作醫生的，也不在少數。他們的來路雖不同，而殺人不見血則一。他們都相信﹁醫者意也﹂；而且都聽慣﹁五行相生相尅﹂的口决；在他們腦子裏所糢糊不淸的，只是各人招牌下究竟有多少屈死鬼。</p>
<p>中醫旣這樣的靠不住，性命又没有一個人不重視的，論理應該一天衰退一天，而西醫便會應運而起。可是事實上社會上的西醫勢力。却還遠不及中醫，這又是什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>社會上有一句流行話：﹁醫靠運，病靠碰﹂，一般社會裏的醫藥情形，眞是一語破的。因爲有許多病症，是可以不藥而愈的，而中藥裏有許多味又是與人體漠不相關或關係至輕的；所以有許多病人經過醫生診視，吃了中藥而漸就痊愈的，當然歸功於醫生，於是醫生病人兩方面都碰運了。至於這病如果不吃藥或許可以更快的痊愈，這是他們所想不到的。至於那種吃了中醫的藥而送命的，他們便又有一句流行諺語來解釋：﹁死病没藥醫﹂。這是中醫所以能在一般社會流行的最大原因。</p>

<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（二）産牀</p>
<p>被褥以通常所用的，即已相宜，軟而厚的被褥，反多不便，被褥上舗以油紙或橡皮布，再罩上一層淸潔的被單，如其更求精密起見，在被單上再加一層油紙或橡皮布，然後在上面再罩淸潔的被單，臨到分娩時，在床上切勿染有汚穢。</p>
<p>如果産室寛大的話，可將産床，安置在産室的中央，否則；宜使産婦頭向壁，足向光明的一端。</p>
<p>（三）産衣</p>
<p>産衣宜寛大，單衣臥衣，均無不可，如穿長衣，就須揭起下半襲，勿令染有血液等汚，分娩終了，立刻就用預先烘熱的衣服更換之。</p>
<p>枕頭應該稍高，蓋被最好輕薄，分娩以後，立即更換較厚的蓋被，以保温暖。</p>
<p>（四）産婦分娩時所取的位置</p>
<p>世界各國，均各有傳統的習俗，但是我們中國人的習俗，各省縣鄉鎭，又是各有不同，産婦分娩一事，大都坐在盆上的，爲最普遍，大槪藉此增强排出力，可以减少分娩的時間，用意雖深，但用力過强，因而子宫壓迫過甚，以致子宫内翻，或竟脫出，甚或早期破胞，以致兒手或臍帶脫出，實覺危險萬分，現在所最通行的。</p>
<p>要算﹁仰臥位﹂或﹁側臥位﹂，這兩種所取的位置，對於排出力作用的方面，可說很少影響。</p>
<p>對於排出期及後産期，或用腹壓的當口，以上身靠起，取﹁半臥位﹂最爲妥適。</p>
<p>倘若子宫在正位，腹壁充分緊張，胎兒位置亦正常，胎兒下降部巳經固定在骨盆内的當兒，那末，可任産婦取其適當的位置。</p>
<p>如其兒頭尚在骨盆入口上端移動時，那末；應取﹁仰臥位﹂，因爲有盆廣寛，陣痛劇烈，分娩經過，或有過速之虞時，應取﹁側臥位﹂。</p>
<h3 id="c221">乳房的美學和科學保護法（上） <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 陶秉珍譯</p>
<p>乳房的三型</p>
<p>乳房元來的形狀有三種，就是：圓盤形，半球形，圓錐形。圓盤形是乳房的高度比底面的半徑短；半球形是高度和底面約半徑的略相等；圓錐形是尖端驟然細削。醜陋的野蠻人，多具圓錐形；至於文明人，那是以半球形和圓盤形居多。而且最好不大不小，因爲太大了，脂肪過多；太小呢，就是表示第二次性徵的薄弱：無論在健康美上，在形態美上，都是不行的。</p>
<p>乳房的適當位置</p>
<p>最重要的，就是牠的位置。在理想中適當的位置，是乳頭在第四根肋骨，至低在第五根肋骨。若將兩臂向左右伸直，從上膀根基，沿着斜走的大胸筋下綠，向胸口晝一條直線：又在胸口直線上，引一根連結腋下的埀直線：這兩線的交點，是乳房中央的乳頭所在地，那末和全身曲線的配置上，是最美的。而且最好身體活動時，他的位置仍舊不變。乳房必須稍稍堅硬，緊滿有力：乳腺密貼在胸筋上面。若脂肪過多，皮膚鬆弛，那末立時便下埀，臥時向左右埀，難以保持正當的位置。乳頭不宜太小，太大，或凹陷，須相當凸出。襯着的乳暈，當成正圓形。</p>
<p>乳房的發達過程</p>
<p>在幼兒期中，男女無别，祗略示痕跡罷了。女孩從十一至十三歲時起，乳頭和周圍的乳暈，便帶着乳紅色，而稍稍墳起，這種形態，好像快要開放的花蕾。後來乳房内的乳腺；發達起來，而漸漸隆起，成圓錐形的小丘，這就是蕾狀乳房，是女子十五六歲前後的發育狀態。此後便到第三期的成熟期分。脂肪增加，全身完成了富麗的曲線美；同時，乳房也因皮下脂肪的綠故，變成圓而柔軟了。</p>
<p>乳房的美的消滅</p>
<p>成熟後的乳房美，若不受體質，姙孕，哺乳，生活狀况，養榮等影饗，可以保持到相當老年；但大多數婦人，一到了中年，因肥胖或消瘦的關係，乳房美消滅了。</p>
<p>一對以上的乳房</p>
<p>乳房的數目，本來以一對爲限，但也有兩對，三對，或更多的女子。這等女子，有一對乳房是照普通情形發達起的；但在他的上下，還有較小的乳房，平常不大看得出，一到妊孕，那末體積雖小，也發達成乳房模樣了。這是一種隔代遺傳，據說這種女子是産孿生子的。</p>
<p>左右不同的乳房</p>
<p>左右不同的乳房，是要到相當年紀，乳房變達成熟時，纔顯現的。相差不遠的居多，若大小懸殊，那就醜了。普通總是左乳較大些的</p>
<p>垂乳房的預防</p>
<p>乳房若和下面胸筋的結合一弛緩，他的位置就生變化而成埀乳房了。凡是過肥多脂的乳房，和過瘦而萎縮的乳房，常要變成埀乳房預防的方法，當然須努力於妊孕和哺乳期内之乳房保護；平時注意於運動和體操，雖也有效，但不過是：鍜鍊筋肉，使能夠支持乳房：以及使胸部挺出，保持乳房的美觀罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c222">新醫學發達過程中幾個重要的發見和發明 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>一七七六年普利斯忒利（Ｐriestley）氏發見了氧化氮氣體（Nitrousoxidegas）；後來韓夫里德維（HurnPbryDavy）氏又發見這氣體具有麻醉性。德維氏其後做了布利斯托（Bristol）研究院長，他得了許多觀察氣體吸入的機會，其中也曾經將氧化氮試騐過一七九九年四月九號，他自己本身也實騐過，覺得這氣體有中毒作用，並且可以治牙痛。一八○○年他公表了這個事實，並且暗示這氧他氮感者可以應用於手術方面；但是直到一八四四年止。終究没有人再用這氣體爲麻醉醇精（ether）在十九世紀時爲雷蒙（RaymondLully）氏所發見後，後來又有許多人研究牠的性質，但是到一七三○年止，尚未得到﹁醇精﹂的命名，以前只把牠當做興奮劑用。到了一七九五年白明罕（Birmingban）地方的披爾生（Pearson）氏纔用爲哮喘和肺癆的吸入劑。幾年後普利茅（Plymoutb）地方的伍爾孔（Woolcombl）氏也用醇精吸入救治哮喘的發作，同時發見繼續吸入多時病人將失去知覺。</p>
<p>一八一八年米采耳（MicbaelFaraday）氏報告吸入醇精的蒸氣可與吸入氧化氮得同樣的麻醉效果。在其後二十年間，醇精的麻醉性更爲許多美國醫家所確認；但是尚未應用於手術方面。</p>
<p>到了一八四二年，美醫郎格（Ｃ·ＷLong）氏曾用醇精吸入法割治某病人頸部的小腫瘍；當時病人並不覺得痛苦。一八四六年九月波士頓（Ｂoston）地方的摩通（W·T·G·Morton）氏受札克遜（C·P·Jackson）氏的勸告，改用醇精拔齒，病人也不覺痛；因此摩通就用，Ｌewtheon的名稱將醇精在英美兩國託册專利。這年十月十六日曾助華冷（J·C·Warren）氏用這藥施行麻醉，割除了一個頸部的腫瘍。這次麻醉，完全成功，於是引起了在塲的許多醫師的興味。當時因爲摩通將藥的成分秘而不宣；所以還有一部分外科醫師對於這藥的應用不免躊躇。可是由那特殊的氣味，不久便都知道這麻醉藥的成分實是醇精；於是這藥的用途便比以前廣大得多了。其後不久這消息便傳到倫敦，在這年十二月十九日，倫敦有一位牙醫魯濱孫（Robinsor）氏曾於醇精麻醉之下施行拔牙手術；再後兩日，大學病院的李士通（RobertListon）氏也用醇精麻醉法鋸斷一個病人的腿部。這次手術只費了三十二秒時。因爲李士通氏還不敢十分相信醇精的效果，所以施術格外地迅速，就和没有用麻醉一樣。</p>
<p>從此以後，醇精在外科手術方面就應用很廣了。當時雖還有些人不用，可是他們的反對也就不能持久。</p>
<p>愛丁堡（Edinburgh）地方的辛博森（Dr·JamesSimpson）氏很早早採用醇精；可是他還覺得不甚滿意，並且想發見一種有醇精的長處而無醇精的缺點的物質。他蒐集了許多認爲有麻醉作用的藥液進行試騐，每晚和助手們先吸入一種物質，然後再吸别種，以試騐牠們相關的利益。他們如此試騐了不少的藥液，等到將近一年，纔試騐到迷矇精（Chloroform）。這迷矇精是一八三一年由三個研究家同時分别發覺的藥液，當時以爲無甚用處，後來辛氏由利物浦（Liverpool）的化學家華耳代（Waldie）氏的介紹，將他的少許贈品加以試騐，纔發見這藥液的麻醉作用。</p>
<p>一八四七年十一月四日，辛博森氏和兩個友人開始吸入迷矇精的蒸氣，不久他們都失去知覺，等到醒來，纔知道他們自己都躺在地板上。這時辛氏纔知道迷矇粗比醇精效用更强而且更好。當時他們互相比較研究，都確信發見了的是一種有用的新麻醉劑。當晚他們又試騐了幾次·至夜深還不分散·直至得到滿意的結果爲止。其後有三個病人的外科手術都用迷矇精麻醉，成績很好。</p>
<p>其後英國方面立刻就用迷矇精代替醇精起來；但是到了一八六八年左右，發生一種變動，於是一部分的醫師從此以後仍舊又用起醇精了。現在據說蘇格蘭方面雖然還用着迷矇精，而英格蘭郤是專用醇精，至於美國，尤其是北部也是好醇精的。</p>
<p>在熱帶，例如在印度地方，還是用迷矇精相宜。因爲醇精在較低的温度中，如華氏表九十六度左右，就要起蒸發作用，而迷矇精的沸點郤在一百四十度的緣故。</p>
<p>氧化氮雖是最初的麻醉劑，其後不久就被人棄置不顧；但是在一八六三年美國的牙科醫師又把牠介紹出來，說是：對於拔齒等簡單的手術最是便利，不但能夠完全麻醉·並且用法安全，作用迅速，而病人也很快復元，此外又罕有不快的後患。因爲效用持續不久，所以用途只限於拔齒和膿痬的切開等短時間的手術。可是近年將氧化氮和養氣混和起來，郤也宜於經時較久的手術，不過費用大些罷了。現在雖還有種種麻醉劑和各種麻醉劑的混合物，用途畢竟不大，實際上仍是醇精，迷矇精和氧化氮的應用範圍最廣呢。</p>

<p>﹁你們初和中國交單、初把盟約破壞的時候、他們就應有一種舉動、他們應當已對你們同盟絶交、毫無顧忌、但是他們並未有何舉動、而且未嘗想有什麽舉動、他們反把軍火售給中國與日本、而且他們仍在出售軍火、你們已經挑動的這一次戰事、决不能靠勇氣或武士道得勝、是要靠軍械來戰勝的了、奮不顧身、一死爲榮的古風、已經過去、現在的步兵衝鋒、不會比一九一四年所見的我、彼時的步兵衝鋒、不過是可笑的殘殺、你們並不如此、你們正在預備用軍械把他們（指中國人）打倒、而他們也要陑備用軍械來打倒你們、祇要他們能夠、﹂</p>
<p>一切戰爭都是自衛</p>
<p>﹁你們說一切都是自衛、你們正在爲自衛而戰、要曉得一切戰爭都是自衛、你們以往的行動、十分的當、因爲你們並未宣戰、﹂</p>
<p>﹁但是假使國聯打算祗做些官樣文章了事、又假使你們祇管打算人家肯讓你們濫用强權、去幹那屠殺與摧毁的勾當、那麽要國聯何用、﹂</p>
<p>﹁然而我以第三者的資格、急於要知道你們言否撫躬自問、你們所做的事情、對於你們實有何益、現在我是一個愛爾蘭人、愛爾蘭是一個國家的小菜園、約有居民四百萬、而英格蘭有居民四千萬、但是英格蘭要防免愛爾蘭人的恢復他們的國籍、終不能成功、爲了要想壓服愛爾蘭人、也曾濫施鐵血政策、大肆焚殺手段、愛爾蘭的領袖密歇　柯靈司、曾說過每有一處乳酷舗被毁、他一定要把兩座郊外的别墅燒毁、作爲報復、你們可曾考慮到這一點麽、在﹁滿洲國﹂裏、有華人二千八百萬、你們打算怎樣去鎭定他們、你們不能夠用警察來辦理此事、警察是無論如何没有用處的、假使居民不呌他進去、就全無效用、中國人當然不肯做這事情、所以你們免不了這個當前的問題、就是在此後幾百年中、你們是否預備去壓　他們、</p>
<p>蕭先生提醒訪問他的人、說他已是七十歲的人了，在他年輕的時候、英格蘭有一種運輸馬車、有時馬要滑跌在地上、</p>
<p>﹁馬滑跌了便如何、爲什麽各人趕緊坐到馬頭上去、無非因爲馬若掙扎着立起來、一定要牽動馬具和車轅、車子或許翻倒、﹂﹁壓制愛國、就像坐在馬頭上一樣、别的事情都没有功夫去做了、愛爾蘭人曾使英國的國會、除討論愛爾蘭的問題以外、没有工夫做别的事情、歷三十餘年、這便是一個證據、﹂</p>
<p>﹁假使你們不得不把此後一百年的時光、都費在騎馬頭、那麽你們要碰見些什麽事情呢、誰在那兒預備作工、或是這工作是否一定要做呢、國家主義者或愛國者决不會來做、他們正要忙於發表言論、﹂　　抱國家主義的愚人</p>
<p>蕭先生講到這裏、稍稍揷入一叚國家主義的議論、</p>
<p>﹁任何愚人都能說國家主義者的話、任何愚人都能夠談談自由以及歷史上的榮光、國家主義旣屬容易、又可以做公衆的大障碍、你們好容易把你們的國基奠定的時候、你們大槪就要覺得非儘怏的把國家主義者槍斃不可、但是就在這當兒、工作櫊起來了、凡此種種、你們當眞在那兒放遠了眼光、加以考察麽、在征服中國之際、可曾想到日本要變成什麽情狀、暴動和恐嚇、就要紛起不絶、而你們終侒要覺得和平的不可能、除非每一中國人、你們派一名警察去監視他、﹂</p>
<p>在蕭氏發此高談闊論的當兒、記者們的鉛筆都停着不動、蕭氏或許因爲經意到此、不多時以後、就乘機說起他已逾應享的年齡、而且已經到了一個時期、在此時期中、大家開始望着他、暗暗的說他活到了偌大年紀、還要不識時務、﹁你們須明白　很可以不顧一切、假使我還祗二十歲就决不直言了、</p>
<p>武士道的意義</p>
<p>有一個人改正道、﹁還有武士道、﹂</p>
<p>好呀、武士道有何意義、武士道是什麽、是否你們所說的愛國主義、愛國者是一個使他自己和他的國家受到嘲笑的人、大槪須把他槍斃、﹂</p>
<p>蕭先生開始發問他自己的問題、</p>
<p>你們信何宗敎、你們旣是新聞記者、諒必不信宗敎、但是······的人民信奉何敎呢、他們可是佛敎徒、還是神道敎徒、還是别的敎徒、</p>
<p>蕭先生眞是一個明白人、</p>
<p>﹁你們當明白我是所各種宗敎集在一起看、我對於宗敎很有好奇之心、凡是宗敎其中都有一部分眞理、所以我都相信、然而一切宗敎都入了邪途、即如以你們此處的佛敎爲例、就不是眞正的佛敎、你們不過立一尊印度的神道、來欺騙民衆、祈求福利而已、﹂</p>
<p>﹁我要在日本訪察何事、無事可察、我不要訪察任何事情、我不過偶然來此而已、我要有一次長途旅行、所以我上了這只船、聞此船適行至此地、我是不得巳而來的、我又在寫一篇戲劇、聊以自慰、寫戲劇才是我約事業、正和補鞋匠的事業是縫靴子一樣、﹂</p>
<p>然而蕭先生對於日本的歌舞伎座、演歌舞的劇戲院、和音樂、確承認他有好奇之心祗要日本戲曲不像中國人大家哼着那千篇一律的不自然的腔調一樣、</p>
<p>其時有幾個别府訪員到來、蕭先生祇說他此次遊歷華北、意興異常濃厚、而張學良將軍是一個受過敎育的文雅的人、絶不和他以前所想像的軍閥一樣、說完這兩句話、就逃準去了、</p>

<p>中德合辦鋼鐵廠問題、前定資本總額本爲八千萬元、嗣因熱戰發生、實長陳公博氏、因鑒於四千萬籌措爲難、乃與德方喜望公司决定、將資本減爲五千萬、仍由雙方共同負担、現實部當局、已派由技師、赴雷家溝試探該地所産煤量、并將予以精密試騐、煤質是否適用於煆煉鋼鐵、兹分誌詳情於後、</p>

<h3 id="c279">中國不亡 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>中國國運，自甲午一役，不幸遇着對頭，開始不利以來，幾乎每年都在﹁破財﹂，都在﹁大傷人口﹂，尤其前年不知走着什麽登峯造極的破敗運，以致三千萬同胞，立時陷於水深火熱中，三百八十萬方里的錦繡山河，突然變了顔色以至於兩易寒署，貪得無厭的暴日，最近又在用着飛機炸彈大砲坦克車等等兇器，在我熱河，積極進行極盡人寰慘事之屠殺了，國人處此墳歷此情，無不疾首蹙額，惄憂﹁國亡無日﹂！</p>
<p>雖然，﹁天道好還﹂，﹁否極泰來﹂，今日國運旣大糟其糕到無以復加，其亦鴻鈞將轉，萬事亨通之機歟，</p>
<p>以言天意，日帝國主義劊子手軍閥財閥，常被暗殺，日皇亦曾一度受驚，僞組織鄭孝胥老賊前次被剌雖未死，然其愛子僞長春市長鄭垂的暴斃，安知非遭天譴？我方民族英雄，在東北苦戰經年之馬蘇馮李諸將軍，已安然脫出虎口，行將聯袂繞道回國，安知非冥冥中有神靈護佑？至於全平和尚捐製十萬﹁神佑黄袋。﹂，不知前方將士。，佩此神袋，更將作如何的神勇。？</p>
<p>以言人心，譽國各色各種的人，誰不心想﹁愛國﹂，口談﹁救國﹂，耳聞﹁共赴國難﹂，目睹﹁抵抗文章﹂！就是素日抵制仇貨，令人所惴惴焉不放心的一般商人。，昨亦印發﹁衣食住行日需之品。，除﹁萬不得已﹂外，槪用國貨﹂之通告。至於﹁長期抵抗﹂，﹁毁家紓難﹂一類的悅耳名詞，尤爲軍民一致擁護之口號。！</p>
<p>以言地利，地大物博，得天獨厚，且此有長城之蜿蜒，可暫阻暴軍之不南下，江河海口，亦多設有砲臺，可阻敵艦之不易駛入。退一萬步說，倘要採用﹁登高臨下﹂之兵法。，無妨全族榮歸帕米爾高原，并設首腦部於額非爾士最高峯。，以避敵機之不能飛上。俟敵仰攻時，只消木石俱下，自可把敵人打得滖坡墜崖，紛紛而退。。</p>
<p>以言軍事，國軍二百萬衆，因連年得有實地練習戰鬭之機會，莫不具有豐富之戰鬭經騐。以故翻閱九一八事變以來之各抗日戰史，卒無一﹁敗﹂字之記載者，良有以也。法人字典中無一﹁難﹂字，我國戰史中亦將從此無一﹁敗﹂字，東西遙遙輝映，豈不漪歟盛哉。？</p>
<p>由此推知﹁中國不亡﹂，可成定論。。吾人若再放棄高枕之權利，徒作無謂之杞憂，不但笨伯已極，抑且有傷泱泱大國之民族風度，烏乎可？烏乎可。？</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個藥店裏的職員，今年十九歲了。當我十七歲的時候，秉父母之命。媒灼之言，定了乂乂的女兒爲妻。我本想明年正式的娶也；可是不幸的事發生了：她現在得到了一種很可怕的病，發作的時候，好像死去一般。我因此很不滿意，我很憂愁，我現在請求先生賜我一個指敎，我想與她脫離關係，她這種的毛病，將來不能維持家庭，有礙我的前程，所以我决然要與她脫離。在法律上，可否達到我的目的？她的病，俗語說的﹁猪顛病﹂。起初的時候，是没有這個毛病，這是最近察覺的。我知道了，就向媒人轉言交涉，與她脫離。不料彼方不答應，反說這是我的不幸，斷斷不能脫離。我想婚姻大事，不可誤會，我處在這種的環境，我很憂愁，如何是好呢？編者先生，你可有妙策，請你不棄指敎我吧！祝你康健。姚尚卿手上。</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂乂乂乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>編者按：猪顛病的確是一種不治之症；我們對於牠的患者，雖說應當憐惜他，但終不能與他結婚。因爲這可以斷送我們的幸福，而絶對不能減少他的痛苦。姚君似宜堅持解約之議。法律上規定的﹁對方有重大不治之症者﹂，得將婚約解除。至於她得病的時候，已經在訂婚之後，也不成問題，也可以適用。我們要知道，要是她訂婚之前，已經有了這病，在訂婚時並不說明的話，姚君現在不但可以要求解約，還可提出損害賠償的要求呢！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>這一氣險些使伍逸立刻打消了來意，拂袖而出，可是轉念好容易有這麽一個做大官的朋友，别得罪了他，斷送掉自己的前程。</p>
<p>﹁千里，······密斯忒趙，···﹂趙千里已改了稱呼，伍逸不得不也變換過來。﹁趙司長，兄弟很覺得慚愧，至今一些没有成就，此番進京拜謁，說實話，當然是·······﹂</p>
<p>﹁當然是想在這裏謀一個差使了！﹂老奸巨滑的趙千里，在接到伍逸的卡片的時候，早料到他今天的來意了。﹁哈哈！我們是老朋友了！你願意來帮忙，斷無不歡迎之理，不過，不過老兄所學的是敎育，這裏所需要的却是財政上的了！</p>
<p>﹁但是，司長，我想如其你能夠給我當一名秘書，似乎還不必一定要懂得會計；我大槪可以，······﹂伍逸老實不客氣的說明了自已的需要。</p>
<p>﹁秘書，那當然是很好。可惜，···可惜，···﹂趙千里想不到他居然正式開口了，便斜着頭頸，裝做極爲難的樣子。﹁可惜我們這裏祇有三位，就是舊任的三位；我暫時不能更動，因爲······！﹂</p>
<p>話才說到這裏，一個穿白竹布制服的聽差，突然推進門來說道：</p>
<p>﹁司長，劉秘書到了，特來謝委！﹂</p>
<p>﹁慢一些！出去！我有客在這裏！﹂這一個强有力的反證，倒使不知羞恥爲何物的趙司長，也紅了半張老臉，祇得惡狠狠地向那不知趣的聽差，下了一個白眼。</p>
<p>形勢已經是僵了，趙千里忽驚醒，想起伍逸畢竟還是一個可怕的報館編輯，爲自已的名利着想，也不宜過分得罪，靈時便變了一副嘴臉。</p>
<p>﹁可是我們究屬是多年的老朋友，老兄不遠千里而來的趕來找我，我怎能使你太失望呢？那末，······那末，······﹂一面說，一面就打他的公事桌上檢起了一份職員薪級表來，怱怱地翻着。﹁那末，我派老兄當一名稽徵員吧！月薪一百二十元，却不必到差，你儘可回上海去，我自能按月將錢匯給你···。﹂</p>
<p>本來，伍逸也未嘗不知道中國官塲中，照例有這麽一套養小老婆？養小舅子的變通辦沫，可是他却萬不曾料到趙千里也是這麽一個以國家公帑爲私人　贈的混帳東西。</p>
<p>專門人才，或是會計的技術人才，就是在商業上有經騐的人，倒也十分需要。······﹂</p>
<p>﹁財政﹂，﹁會計﹂，﹁專門﹂，﹁技術﹂，這些鋼一般硬的特别名詞，幾乎把伍逸嚇壞了；他祇得旋過了頭，臉向着左邊，不敢以正眼相視。在左邊，有一架絶大的書架，上面堆的全是三四寸厚，皮面金字的洋裝書，十九倒是世界各大心理學家的巨著，伍逸對於心理學雖然也曾研究過，這時候，他却不能不懷疑趙千里當初在美國所研究的心理學，也許是一種特别的心理學，可以代替財政學的心理學了；否則他以爲趙千里自己旣非財政上的專門家，無論如何荒謬，也斷不會再把這些﹁財政﹂，﹁會計﹂，﹁專門﹂，﹁技術﹂的特别名詞來刁難别人</p>

<h3 id="c284">明星們的秋波 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>一個人的性格行爲在兩隻眼睛裏可以猜到心窩裏去，如果和藹的性格，眼中終帶些慈祥氣昧，如果惡毒的性格眼中就現出兇光來了，同時女子的明眸能表現充分的美，所謂秋波一轉，足以消魂，我們如果拿電影明星的眼睛揣摩一下，那麽明星們某一種作風都可以在她的明眸中尋出來，也是怪有趣的事。瓊克勞馥是出名的大眼姐，她的眼睛的大，當然無用說得了，瓊克勞馥的大眼，平心而論起來，實在稍微妨礙她面部的美，但是她的大眼十足的神氣，她就因爲這對大眼睛而達到神氣活現的作風。在大飯店和雨二片中她的精彩就在兩隻大眼睛上，是無可諱言的。</p>
<p>和瓊克勞馥相反的是瑙瑪希拉，瑙瑪希拉的眼睛特别小，她的眸大並且常揷在上面眼脣下，所以一望，就知道是個細心而拘謹的閨女派調，令人起威敬之感，她的作風都在中間顯露無遺了。</p>
<p>葛萊泰嘉寶的眼睛很深刻悲切，她演到慘淡頑艶處都能給人表不少的同情，她的婉轉的秋波，像一池春水，能使人陶醉而沈溺其中。</p>
<p>熱女郎克萊拉寳的眼中現出充分的熱，而帶有剛强不覊的氣味，她的眼睛上眼脣和眉毛相距極近，這是剛强不覊的特徵。</p>
<p>珍　蓋諒的眼波中現着十分的温柔和悅，她的作風嬌小玲瓏，無限的可愛，盡在温柔之中。</p>
<p>瑪琳黛德麗的眼波尖銳透明，所以她的作風趨向於神妙莫測，須背後推測，尋弦外之音的。</p>

<h3 id="c285">評﹁偷情記﹂LoveOnTheSpot <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>昨天看了卡爾登所映的﹁偷情記﹂，忽然想到兩個月以前看的﹁性愛的俘虜﹂。眞的，這張﹁偷情記﹂雖然是根據小說改編的，但和﹁性愛的俘虜﹂却有異曲同工之妙而且在故事，技藝各方面，也有些相同。</p>
<p>本事是這樣的：在一個旅館裏，住了一位少年，他是個妙手空空的穿窬者。在三次失竊以後，偵探雖然猜疑到他，但是一些拿不着憑據。那時另一個女郎和她的父親，也住在這旅館裏。父女們都是戴了紳士假面具的騙子。但是女郎愛上了這少年，她坦白的說明她以後要改過了。少年也受了感動，盡還贓物，兩人一同走向正當之路。</p>
<p>演員是我們很生疏的。飾竊賊的少年是瑞却杜門RickadDolman，他表現出英國靑年們所有的態度。面部自然的表情，載歌載舞，煞是討人喜歡。也許可以認爲他有看佛萊的動人吧？他的活潑詼諧，使人極端滿意。尤其是他極切合於劇中人。飾女郎的是柔絲瑪瑞愛姆RosemaryAmes大致還好。她很美麗，只是表情差了些。唱的曲子很不錯。她的父親是由阿伯瑞馬特Ａnbreymather飾的，專以說白討俏，可以呌人發笑。</p>
<p>被竊的老嫗海綸　和HelenFerrers，在配角中佔了極重要的地位。她所表演的，刻骨形容着一般自傲的貴族式夫人，很爲中肯。至於那小孩子約翰莘格JohnSinger是很可造就的，在這片子裏，已現出了極大的表演天才。</p>
<p>對白並不太多，如果你能每一句都</p>
<h3 id="c286">大鼻嘲 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>在好萊塢甚之小孩子你對他說大鼻子先生時，没有不知道是指點傑美社倫的傑美的名聲，全靠他的鼻子生出來的，他旣有這樣一隻令人稱羡的大鼻子，於是有許多人造了一隻歌謠來嘲笑他，大意是：</p>
<p>落杉磯姐兒們面上的香粉，在皮佛萊的山頂上可以聞得到；到了夏天，眞可當作一把遮陽傘，使三個小孩子可以躱在底下乘凉；但是裏面的風太熱了，不如到海濱去乘凉吧！</p>
<p>呀丨可氣我爲什麽不也生這麽一個東西，好在好萊塢賺大錢呢？</p>
<p>明白，那末你可以找到無數的幽默材料，使你發笑。</p>
<p>至於導演，只能算中等以上。攝影上，角度地位不錯。光線也可以看。衣飾和佈景，一望而知牠是英國片子，美麗之中，很帶了高貴的大陸色彩。當然，每一個演員的態度，也都有關係的。剪接一切還不錯。至於藉以號召的大游泳，在水池裏的女郎們，和鏡頭的攝下，雖然抄舞台團體舞的故技，但仍不失其新穎，只可惜太短而變化太少。四隻曲子，都是﹁爵士歌﹂ＴazzSongs，可以說一個﹁好﹂字。</p>
<p>在一切歌舞片中，配樂常常是應當很好的。但是道一張片子的音樂很平常，鼓不起人的興奮。</p>
<p>劇義方面，很是淺薄的，但還有些諷剌和調笑意味。（例如在六十歲老翁的老袋中，搜出乂史）</p>
<p>總之，這張片子，可以使你有快感，可以使你發笑。雖然，牠不能呌你永久記着牠。</p>
<p>這是好萊塢一生長在中國的女明星，名字呌霞麗馬立薩，在本刊三月六日思瀛君的﹁一位無國籍的女子﹂中已介紹過。</p>

<p>﹁再坐一次﹂？少年提議，當飛車到站頭停下。</p>

<p>迅雷地，飛車又依軌疾馳，他的手臂又擁住她，而她，無從抵拒地，閉住眼睛，把粉類依偎在他的肩。</p>

<p>他的嘴半張着，簡直不敢喘息，守到表演終了。她下了繩，似乎在園聚着的觀衆招中尋他，於是，向着他的方向，擲了一個空吻。一聲長長的嘆息從他的嘴唇發出，終究，他决意走向寫着﹁閑人莫入﹂的後臺門。在那兒，他潤乾濕他的乾的嘴唇，守候着，直至愛蜜蘭，穿了便裝，欣愉地走出來歡迎他。（未完）</p>

The Japanese army and most of the puppet troops, after reaching Shahe Village, used all their strength to advance towards Shimen, with the cover of aircraft and heavy artillery.

<p>(Beiping) The Military Affairs Committee received a report that a certain unit of the Northeast Army had fled to a certain village more than ten li north of Xiyuan the day before yesterday. It immediately ordered the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters to dispatch a team to encircle and suppress them last night. The deserters were carrying weapons such as machine guns and grenades. After being surrounded, they immediately resisted arrest and a fierce battle broke out. The situation was thoroughly resolved this morning. As a result, in addition to those who were killed, all the remaining deserters were disarmed and captured, totaling nineteen people. They were sent to Ping this morning. Several soldiers from the garrison unit were also killed or wounded. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Sino-Russian Commercial Treaty and the National Consumer Cooperative <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Since the economic panic among capitalist countries is becoming more and more profound, the state of capitalism moving from shaking to extinction is becoming more and more obvious. Although academic economists still use superficial theories of prosperity, decline, and perpetual cycles as a means of self-deception, the declining trend of the river flowing downwards cannot be reversed by wishful thinking. All attempts to restore prosperity will only be a flash in the pan and will inevitably become the final struggle. MacDonald failed in the former, how can Hitler be effective in the latter? Hoover's repeated declarations have all become unfulfilled promissory notes, so how can Roosevelt have the ability to reverse the situation and save the dying to fulfill his promises during the election?</p>
<p>At a time when the entire society is gradually moving away from the realm of capitalism and entering a new path of socialism, China, which is only a corner of the world, cannot go against the trend. In this country where national capital is extremely immature, it may be easier to change course because the accumulated difficulties have not yet become overwhelming. For many years, domestic sages have had differing opinions on the steps of social transformation, but have reached a consensus on the direction of the socialist path. Regardless of what method or steps China takes to achieve the goal of socialism, it may be mutually beneficial to establish close ties with the Soviet Union in the economy and create a unified front. The current national crisis has made us realize the extreme mistake of severing relations with the Soviet Union, so reviving Mr. Sun Yat-sen's strategy of alliance with the Soviet Union is in line with the philosophy of "when things are exhausted, there will be change; change will lead to progress."</p>
<p>At a time when the two countries are mutually dispatching envoys and consuls and national exchanges are gradually increasing, the signing of a Sino-Soviet commercial treaty is an important task at hand. Regarding the issue of the commercial treaty, before the most-favored-nation clause is abolished, the contents of commercial treaties signed by our country with various countries may be largely the same, but in essence, they are almost uniform due to the inclusion of the most-favored-nation clause. We cannot hope to find any special significance in the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty. However, the establishment of the so-called Trade Bureau with the Soviet Union, which is associated with the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty, is worth studying.</p>
<p>The general significance of the Trade Bureau with the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union's foreign trade is entirely state-owned, with unified authority and consistent policies. If we conduct transactions with them separately through private individuals, the resulting competition may prevent us from obtaining favorable terms, and it would be overwhelming for them to deal with us separately. Therefore, a bureau must be established to achieve a one-on-one position in order to achieve direct and fair transactions. However, we believe that the duties of the bureau should go far beyond this. We must further organize the national consumer market in order to build a strong economic united front.</p>
<p>At a time when there is a surplus of all commodities in the world, what capitalist powers covet in our country is this vast consumer market that can absorb their surplus commodities. Therefore, controlling the consumer market is the most effective way to deal with the powers. In recent years, our struggle against Japan has also used economic severance as a weapon, but the shortcoming is that the focus has only been on passive resistance and there has been little active organization. Even the so-called promotion of domestic goods movement, its methods and steps are still too empty and scattered. If we can further pool huge capital to organize a national consumer cooperative, with domestic products as the center and Soviet products to supplement the deficiencies, order a large number of necessities from the Soviet Union under the guidance of the Trade Bureau with the Soviet Union, and distribute them to general consumers at low prices together with domestic products, and purchase what is still insufficient from other powers that are friendly to us, then not only will the struggle against Japan achieve extremely high economic results, but also the purchase issue can be used as an effective tactic in negotiating between the powers.</p>
<p>However, all the above is premised on the ability to incite an anti-imperialist national revolution against Japan. If the people's determination to resist Japan is still subject to suppression due to the threat of Japanese gunboats, and the policy of seeking temporary peace through compromise has not changed drastically, then organization and policies will all become empty talk on paper.</p>

<p>Requires an Expenditure of 230 Million U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>To Avoid the Scorn of a "Paper Fleet"</p>
<p>(Washington) Vincent, Chairman of the U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee, proposed a ship construction program today, advocating the construction of thirty new ships within three years to end the era of the American "paper fleet." He hopes that President Roosevelt will support this proposal. According to Vincent's plan, the United States must immediately begin building the new ships permitted by the London Treaty. It is planned to build twenty destroyers, five light cruisers, four submarines, and one aircraft carrier within three years, requiring a total expenditure of 230 million gold dollars. It is estimated that the expenditure in the first year will not exceed 46 million gold dollars. This sum can be indirectly raised as long as the various departments of national defense make every effort to economize on political expenses. He firmly advocates strict economy in naval spending, but the time has come for shipbuilding and we cannot abandon eating for fear of choking. Moreover, this plan not only provides jobs for the unemployed and increases the effectiveness of the navy, but also allows the United States to have other physical objects besides a few drawings when discussing arms reduction with other countries. As for the reduction of naval administration, he believes that other than merging the Naval Purchasing Department with the Army Purchasing Department, there is little room for savings. Vincent has met with President Roosevelt several times regarding shipbuilding. He once told the President that it is estimated that it will cost 600 million gold dollars over five years to build all the warships permitted by the London Treaty. The new program proposed by Vincent today has not yet exceeded this estimated amount. However, it has exceeded half the amount of his first proposal to the President to spend 30 million gold dollars annually for shipbuilding expenses, probably because Vincent anticipated that disarmament would be difficult to agree to in the near future, so he advocated slightly increasing the shipbuilding budget in order to see it completed sooner.

<p>Prime Minister of Japan's Future to be Clearly Indicated</p>
<p>Seiyūkai Attempts to Regain Power</p>
<p>But Party Rule Will Not Be Easily Revived for the Time Being</p>
<p>Shizuoka, today, 9:30 AM, Prime Minister Saitō visited Saionji in Okitsu, reported in detail the events of withdrawing from the League of Nations, as well as future diplomatic policies and the results of the Diet, and recent political situations. Furthermore, regarding the current situation, the Prime Minister disclosed his political views. Saionji then strongly encouraged the Prime Minister, saying that the current extraordinary situation is becoming increasingly serious. The Emperor has also issued an edict, urging the nation to awaken. Therefore, if the political situation becomes unstable at this time, it would be extremely frightening. One should uphold the Emperor's will, shoulder the responsibility of the current situation, and not lightly advance or retreat, deeply hoping for full self-respect, and so on. Therefore, Prime Minister Saitō will temporarily endeavor to take on the difficult task. After a meeting of more than one hour, he departed at 10:40 AM, and at 1:40 PM took the express train from Shizuoka Station to return to Kyoto. According to the Prime Minister, he reported in detail to Prince Saionji today the events of withdrawing from the League of Nations. As for future diplomatic policies, a concrete decision has not yet been made, but Japan must proceed in cooperation with the great powers. Therefore, withdrawal is a separate issue, and efforts must be made in this regard in the future. Prince Saionji fully understands the government's current policy and has told me to devote myself to the country until death. Therefore, I myself will naturally proceed with this determination. As for the May 15 Incident, it is planned to be completed within May. Although Minister of Justice Oyama personally intends to resign, I hope that he will remain in office, as does Minister of Finance Takahashi. As for the development of the current situation, although there are various rumors, the Diet has just concluded, and there are still many things that need to be done. Therefore, now is not the time to resign, and future matters are still under consideration. (2nd, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saitō, after returning to Kyoto from Okitsu this afternoon, made an informal statement to reporters, and it is scheduled to convene a temporary emergency cabinet meeting on the morning of the 4th to report to each cabinet member the important strategies of the current political situation after meeting with the elder statesman and Prince Saionji. However, the fate of the Saitō Cabinet was not mentioned. It is generally speculated that the issue of the Saitō Cabinet's future will be clearly indicated after the emergency cabinet meeting (2nd, Chinese United News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saitō's meeting with Prince Saionji has a significant relationship with the future political situation, and all aspects of the political world are paying close attention. The observations of the Seiyūkai and the Minseitō are each beneficial to their respective parties, so it is feared that a considerably complex vortex will be unavoidable depending on the Prime Minister's attitude in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Seiyūkai's Perspective on the Prime Minister <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Meeting with Prince Saionji</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's conversation only considered others and spoke of the present, but there was no expression of new future plans or ambitions. If there is a true determination to shoulder the major current situation, then it is not just a matter of handling the aftermath of the Diet. This point actually exposes the powerlessness of the current cabinet and hints at the direction of the political situation. In short, the current cabinet's ability to achieve extraordinary results in this Diet is all due to the background of the Seiyūkai. The government has already done its best and has nothing else to do. Therefore, from a fair point of view, the reason for the existence of the current cabinet has now disappeared, and it has already achieved success and fame. Even the Prime Minister's meeting with Prince Saionji implicitly indicates this atmosphere. This is not a selfish view of our party but a very fair and appropriate observation. The current government is intent on organizing the post-Diet duties, seemingly in anticipation of a satisfactory resolution of the political situation.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Minseitō's Perspective <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Prime Minister's Meeting with Prince Saionji</p>
<p>Regarding reporting on the withdrawal from the League of Nations and the conclusion of the Diet, as for political issues, it is feared that the responsibility in the future will become increasingly important, and it has been decided to exert all efforts to do so. It is believed that Prince Saionji understands this, and Prince Saionji also deeply understands this and hopes for the Prime Minister's self-respect. As a result, the rumors of political unrest should be swept away. Furthermore, the Prime Minister believes that the next Diet can be passed without incident. If it is not easy to pass, whether or not there is a determination to dissolve the Diet and discuss ways to open up the political situation will become a problem. In any case, the Minseitō is vigilant against all maneuvers at this time, and will consistently maintain the current cabinet in a just and upright manner. Regarding these matters, the Minseitō will informally report the party's actions in the Diet, and to gain understanding, it will soon send Secretary-General Matsuda to visit Prince Saionji. (2nd, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo, March 28) The Japanese Diet has adjourned on March 25. During the session of this Diet, the friendly attitude between the government and the Seiyūkai was clearly visible. Now, however, rumors of a cabinet change are rampant. According to reports, some time ago, it was widely rumored that Prime Minister Saitō and Seiyūkai President Suzuki had reached an understanding that if the Seiyūkai supported the passage of the 1933-34 budget, the current national unity cabinet would resign after the Diet adjourned and recommend the organization of a purely Seiyūkai cabinet to replace it. This is why the Seiyūkai adopted a friendly attitude during the Diet session, partly in the hope of regaining power. Although this specific understanding is highly questionable, if the current cabinet resigns, the power to select a successor will largely be in the hands of the elder statesman Saionji. It is said that the Seiyūkai's recent opposition to Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and its insistence to the end is due to this reason, as the Seiyūkai members are well aware that Saionji is also opposed to withdrawal. It is easy to see that the Seiyūkai is making every effort to prepare for its return to power. It should be noted that on May 15, when Seiyūkai Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated, the Seiyūkai held an absolute majority in the House of Representatives. After this act of violence occurred, it was necessary to organize a strong national unity government to cope with the serious domestic and foreign situation. The Seiyūkai now says that the current crisis has passed and a national unity government is no longer needed, so it believes that there is reason to take back power from Saitō now. If the Seiyūkai's words are credible and the national crisis has indeed disappeared, then the change of cabinet will naturally be easy. However, outside observers believe that the current restoration of party rule is extremely dangerous and may be even worse than the infighting a year ago that led to the establishment of a national unity government. There are many reasons why the Japanese people were united last year, but the two largest were the pressure from Geneva and the excitement over the Manchurian Incident. Now that Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, external condemnation is gradually diminishing, and the development of Manchuria is largely settled and no longer as active and dynamic as before. Therefore, Japan's unity is likely to weaken. Moreover, taxes are surprisingly high, and the people bear unprecedented burdens and sacrifices. Therefore, the general opinion is that Japan still urgently needs a national unity government today.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the Japanese government formally notified its withdrawal from the League of Nations, the issue of the mandated rule of the South Pacific Islands became the center of international disputes. In addition, since Hitler came to power, the German government has expressed a clear attitude on this issue. Although Japan has repeatedly tried to escape this difficult situation with appeasement and double-edged political maneuvers, it has become clear in recent days that this issue cannot be resolved by simple means. Therefore, after several secret discussions between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy, it has been decided that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a formal and important statement on the South Pacific rule issue on the 4th, expressing the Japanese government's clear attitude on this issue. According to sources, once this statement is issued, it will cause a major wave in the international community. (2nd, Chinese United News)</p>

<p>(Washington) Former Japanese Chief Delegate to the League of Nations, Matsuoka Yōsuke, met with Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday for two hours. The conversation concerned economic issues, especially the issue of raising silver prices. Matsuoka then met with former Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McReynolds. He then visited the French Ambassador to the United States, Claudel, and U.S. Under Secretary of State Moley. In the evening, he attended a banquet at the Japanese Embassy, which was also attended by many key figures in the American political world. This afternoon, Matsuoka will give a lecture in Chicago on the Manchurian situation, and within a few days he will also visit the Troy Motor Factory and other factories. (2nd, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Using New York Newspaper Space to Sow Discord Between China and the United States <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published an article by former Japanese Chief Delegate to the League of Nations, Matsuoka Yōsuke, explaining Japan's position on the Manchurian issue and the process of withdrawing from the League of Nations. The main idea is that he admits that the United States and Japan are mutually suspicious, and that American newspapers in general, as well as the attitude adopted by the League of Nations, have not given Japan fair treatment. Japan has no grievances against the League of Nations, but Japan has no choice but to declare its withdrawal, which it deeply regrets. There are fundamental differences between the opinions of the League of Nations and Japan. The Lytton Commission's intention is to create temporary international cooperation through various specialized committees to achieve internal transformation of China. This is due to an insufficient understanding of the situation in China. China is the largest country in the world, and the task of restoring order from chaos is extremely arduous, which cannot be accomplished by the League of Nations' original methods. Only force can solve it. To eliminate Chinese warlords, it is necessary to take this major measure, but no country or several countries are willing to do so. Matsuoka recalled the old case of the humiliation of the American Consul in Nanjing, saying that at that time, the United States had to station troops in China and park warships in commercial ports to protect diplomatic representatives. This fact is unprecedented for other countries, and two soldiers must be sent to protect each foreign businessman. What benefits can be said to exist in trade with China under such circumstances? He also said that the United States' trade with Japan, apart from the United Kingdom, is more than with any other country. The United States' exports to the Far East, including the Philippines, are not as much as its exports to Japan. Japan does not want to close the door of American trade in China, and even less does it want to close the door of American trade with Japan. Matsuoka also criticized the United States' pro-China policy, saying that the United States' position on China is contradictory to its general policy. Although the American government has asked the Senate to ratify the Nine-Power Treaty to guarantee the territorial integrity of China, it has at the same time refused to join the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice, unwilling to provide the same guarantee to European countries. How is this not a contradiction? He also said that many Japanese people are concerned about the American sentiment towards Japan, but he does not care. Although the American people sympathize with China, after the final analysis, the American intellect will overcome its emotions. Matsuoka concluded by saying that Japan's actions in Manchuria are logical and effective, enough to save humanity and peace in the Far East. (2nd, Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>A Refugee Account from Gubeikou</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to refugees from Gubeikou, on the morning of the 11th of last month, a Japanese tank drove into Gubeikou and patrolled the main street of Hedong for a week. At the same time, a Japanese plane flew in and scattered leaflets everywhere, stating "Welcome the army of the Great Japanese Empire to enter the country, quickly bring flags to greet them outside the pass, otherwise Gubeikou will be bombed into scorched earth." That afternoon, the main enemy force of one thousand men marched in formation, mostly Korean bandits, with only a few Japanese soldiers among them. After the enemy arrived, they looted everything on the first night. Slightly better wooden furniture was moved outside the pass for fuel, and broken objects were thrown all over the streets. After occupying the area, the enemy troops conducted extensive searches, and any intellectuals or former soldiers were immediately put to death. On the 19th night, a platoon of our troops sneaked up to the high building on the eastern wall of Gubeikou. There were nine Japanese sentries in the building, eight of whom were killed by our troops with hand grenades, and the remaining one was wounded and escaped. After a while, a large force of enemy reinforcements arrived and engaged our troops in a long battle. They eventually retreated due to lack of support. After suffering this major blow, the Japanese cut off all traffic on the streets of Gubeikou. The Japanese military suffered heavy casualties. The wounded were transported back for medical treatment, and the dead were collected from all the residents of Gubeikou and placed in coffins, two or three Japanese soldiers per coffin, and transported to Xijiaochang to be burned. Of the more than one thousand households in Gubeikou, two-thirds had fled. (2nd, Special Dispatch)</p>

It is also reported that the State Department is paying no attention to this matter because experts from the Department of Commerce say that the spread of this statement is merely launching a trial balloon to see if there is any possibility of a change in the United States' attitude towards recognition.

As for the organization of this agency and the raising of capital, the ministry has invited representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance to conduct preliminary discussions. It was originally intended to continue the discussions to make a final decision, but the Ministry of Finance requested a postponement, stating that it would be responsible for raising official capital, so it was necessary to consider it at length. However, the Soviet ambassador will arrive in Beijing soon, and the Sino-Soviet trade agreement needs to be signed urgently.

<p>Jewish Shops: Some Closed, Some Operating Normally</p>
<p>No Riots Reported Anywhere Except Kiel</p>
<p>Schleicher Announces End to Boycott Is Unnecessary</p>
<p>Einstein's Property Confiscated by German Authorities</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 1st: The organization of the anti-Jewish movement in Berlin is disorganized. Despite the nationwide announcement of a boycott against Jewish shops, many still remained open for business, even with anti-Jewish signs displayed in their windows. Most Jewish shops in Berlin proper were closed, but not all large Jewish shops in the suburbs followed suit, and their owners were not disturbed. Many non-Jewish shop employees in these closed large Jewish shops were left with nothing to do, and these employees did not entirely support the anti-Jewish boycott. Groups of people gathered in front of the closed Jewish shops, discussing the matter in heated tones, while brown-shirted comrades walked among them, placing signs on the windows to indicate that they were Jewish shops. Today is the day of the National Socialist Party's major demonstration; swastika flags and imperial flags were flying on all trams and streetcars in Berlin, and military bands paraded through the streets, playing military songs and patriotic songs. The streets of Kurfürstendamm were crowded, many shops were closed, and the number of idlers increased. The anti-Jewish movement on Kurfürstendamm was very strict; not only were leaflets posted outside Jewish shops, but also Jewish doctors' offices and other offices were boycotted. What was particularly discouraging was the placement of cameras in front of Jewish shops; anyone seen leaving a Jewish shop was photographed, and as a result, people did not dare to enter. Today is Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, so many Jews took the opportunity to close their shops. There have been no instances of violence against people in the Kurfürstendamm area. The train to Denmark today was full of passengers, all of whom were Jews leaving the country. Several hundred disembarked in Copenhagen, but many others continued on to other parts of Denmark.</p>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 1st: General Schleicher, leader of the anti-Jewish movement, declared here tonight that, according to telegrams from overseas, it is not necessary to continue the boycott after Wednesday, April 5th. Therefore, the boycott will be limited to one day, and will end nationwide tonight, approximately.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 1st: Today, Germany held a nationwide one-day boycott of Jewish shops to express the German people's indignation at the Jews' anti-German propaganda. However, the day passed peacefully and without incident. All shops not owned by Jews posted large characters on their windows reading "German Shop" to avoid being mistaken for Jewish shops and attacked by the crowd. Austrian Jews operating shops in Berlin also wrote "Austrian Shop" on their windows. There were no unexpected events in the provinces, except in Kiel, where a Jewish lawyer shot a National Socialist Stormtrooper in the midst of the anti-Jewish turmoil, seriously wounding him. The lawyer, named Scheim, was arrested and imprisoned, but the public was so outraged that they broke into the prison and killed Scheim. They then swarmed to the shop owned by Scheim's father and destroyed all the goods.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 1st: Professor Einstein's bank deposits have been frozen today by the Berlin political police. In addition, mortgages and cash worth about 30,000 marks have also been confiscated by the authorities. According to newspaper reports, the reason for these harsh measures is that this money was apparently used for treasonous purposes. Furthermore, the Prussian Academy of Sciences issued a statement today stating that it was outraged by newspaper reports of Professor Einstein's participation in anti-German propaganda in France and the United States. Einstein was originally a Swiss citizen, but obtained Prussian citizenship in 1913 after being elected as a member of the Academy of Sciences. Now, he is openly engaged in anti-German propaganda abroad, which is contrary to the Academy's principles and ideology. Therefore, the Academy considers itself fortunate that Einstein has left the organization.</p>

<p>TASS, London, 1st: Local newspapers are disappointed that the U.S. has not paid much attention to the Moscow British engineer case. They had hoped that this case would hinder the progress of establishing diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

<p>French Ambassador to Italy Returns to Paris</p>
<p>Reports on Rome Negotiations</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 1st: This afternoon at 4:00, the British ambassador to France, Lord Tyrrell, visited Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, with the aim of informing Paul-Boncour of the opinions of the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary after consulting with the French authorities in Paris. After Tyrrell left, the Foreign Minister immediately reported the results of his conversation with Tyrrell to Prime Minister Daladier. The French ambassador to Rome, Suvard, has returned to Paris to report all news related to the current situation to the authorities. Since the government has clearly understood the British and Italian proposals, it can fully express its views. It is expected that a cabinet meeting will be held next week to discuss the matter. This afternoon, Suvard and Paul-Boncour talked for two hours. Suvard reported to Paul-Boncour all the details of the recent negotiations between the British and Italian authorities in Rome. The two then exchanged views on the negotiations in Rome and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 1st: The French Ambassador to Rome, Suvard, arrived in Paris at 9:50 AM this morning. At 3:00 PM, he visited Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. They talked until 4:00 PM, when the British Ambassador, Tyrrell, arrived, and the conversation was temporarily suspended for half an hour. Afterwards, they resumed the conversation until 5:00 PM. Suvard then went to the Ministry of War and met with Prime Minister Daladier.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 2nd: The French Ambassador to Italy, Suvard, has returned to the country and recently received a representative from this agency. He issued an important statement regarding the plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Suvard strongly advocated that an accurate report must be made to public opinion, so that false news does not confuse listeners. Suvard stated that the plan circulated externally is not what was discussed in Rome. The wording of the plan drafted in Rome has not yet been finalized. Mussolini's intention is that the draft agreement should be included within the scope of the League of Nations. Its main points are that the four major powers participate in the work of the League of Nations, and that the disarmament conference achieves results, as it has the same benefits. There is a need to reach an understanding. If the disarmament conference fails, then organize a true "insurance company" to avoid the danger after the failure and all attempts to modify the peace treaty by force. However, no country among the four major powers should evade this contract, as it is in the common interest of all countries. Suvard concluded that Mussolini believed that France, being loyal to the League of Nations, would certainly understand the purpose of this agreement, which would strengthen the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Effective July 1st</p>
<p>Affects 400,000 People</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 2nd: President Roosevelt's order regarding the reduction of veterans' pensions will take effect on July 1st of this year. The terms of this order stipulate that all pensions will be reduced by 20% and the method of payment will be modified. The following conditions must be met in order to receive a pension: (1) must have enlisted for at least three months; (2) the enlistment period must be before the cessation of hostilities; (3) must have a certificate of good conduct for the enlistment period; (4) long-term disability must not be due to misconduct. This order will apply to veterans of the Spanish-American War, the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Philippine Insurrection, and the European War of 1914. For widows of veterans of the three wars before the Great War, the pensions they should receive will be reduced by 50%. It is estimated that according to this order, 400,600 people will no longer receive pensions.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 2nd: The Disabled Veterans of the European War Association strongly opposes President Roosevelt's order to reduce the pensions of veterans, which amounts to 400 million gold yuan. The chairman of the association, Conley, declared that we have those who lost their sight and those with crippled limbs fighting in Europe. The fact that the pensions enjoyed by these people are being reduced so much will arouse resentment among the people. Public opinion throughout the country will demand that the government keep the promises made in 1918.</p>

<p>What will future wars be like? Needless to say, we all know that everything is evolving, and war has also evolved greatly from ancient times to the present. In the wars of primitive times, the main subject of war was roughly one person as the center, or one clan as the center. However, as society gradually evolved, the main subject of war gradually expanded to include nations, tribes, cities, or countries. Also, ancient wars were limited to a portion of the population, especially a small number of people advocating the use of force to wage war. Therefore, the end of the war was always attributed to the downfall of the central figure, the decline of one clan, or the defeat of the armed group of a tribe, city, or country. However, since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1873, the state of evolution has been particularly apparent. That is, the French army was almost completely destroyed by the German army. Although the field army was a false message and did not cause confusion. Suvard declared that the plan circulated externally is not what was discussed in Rome.

<p>What kind of form will future wars take? Needless to say, we all know that everything evolves, and war has also evolved greatly from ancient times to the present. In the wars of the primitive era, the main subject of the war was roughly centered on one person, or one clan. However, as society gradually evolved, the main subject of war gradually expanded to ethnic groups, tribes, cities, or countries. Furthermore, ancient wars were limited to a part of the population, especially a small number of people who advocated the use of force to fight. Therefore, the end of the war was always attributed to the downfall of the central figure, or the demise of a clan, or the defeat of armed groups of tribes, cities, or countries. However, since the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1873, an evolutionary state has been particularly manifested, that is, the French army was almost completely destroyed by the German army. Although the field army was completely defeated, it is said that the strength of the volunteer army assembled by Gambetta afterwards was 2.5 million. This shows that in this era, even if the field army is destroyed, if the people still have a strong will to continue the war, they can still fight for the country. After that, although the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War also occurred, these were not considered thorough wars, and can be said to have ended midway. Therefore, the so-called national war form was not manifested. If Japan had been defeated at that time, it would have gathered volunteer soldiers again to continue the national decisive battle. As for the World War, needless to say, almost all of Europe participated in the war. There is history that can testify to the footprint of its evolution. That is, in the primitive era, war was a state of one person against one person. However, due to the evolution of society, war has gradually become various forms, such as the Franco-Prussian War, which can be said to be a war of the whole people, and the World War, which can be said to be a war of national power. If there is another war in the future, I think that this future war has a very close relationship with the entire world's politics, economy, transportation, and transportation. Therefore, the occurrence of war is less like a military war state of one country against one country like the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, and more like a complex war state of several countries against several countries or one country against several countries. From this point of view, in the future war, the number of soldiers used by the two armies should increase compared to past battles. Therefore, more military supplies should also be needed. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the methods of engagement have also changed greatly, and finally become the so-called war of national power. Therefore, when two countries are at war, eliminating the enemy country's will to continue the war is also counted as a tactic. So, what methods should be used to eliminate the enemy country's will to continue the war? There are many methods. To give one or two examples, one method is to use propaganda to dispel the army's or the people's belief in victory. Furthermore, airplanes are very developed now. Transporting a ton of bombs by plane from a distance and dropping them on political centers such as Tokyo or economic and industrial centers such as Nagoya or Kitakyushu is another method. Or, airplanes can still be used to drop bombs on industrial cities to plan to destroy their resources. This kind of planned destruction of resources is also a method of engagement. Other measures, such as the starvation policy or economic blockade adopted by Germany against Britain, should also be regarded as an important means of engagement. Recently, a certain country (referring to the Soviet Union) even issued a statement that there will be no front lines in future wars. In fact, when fighting a war, bullets must be used to confront each other. Therefore, there is no such thing as a war without a front line. However, a certain country's means of engagement are like this: on the one hand, fighting on the front line, while expanding the front line, from the rear of the front line, to the colonies and the enemy country, using various methods to eliminate its military force, or guide its revolution. Indeed, it may be possible for a certain country to adopt such means of engagement. From this point of view, future wars are no longer linear or planar, but three-dimensional. In terms of region, the war has expanded from the battlefield to the country. Regarding the equipment of the army, during the World War, Germany used poison gas to attack secretly, causing the British army to be defeated. Conversely, Britain used tanks to break into the German army, putting the German territory in danger. As such, weapons have made tremendous progress due to war. In the future, new weapons will inevitably be produced in response to the times. Moreover, these weapons will use a large amount of iron. Recently, the tendency to use a large amount of poison gas materials has also been clearly manifested. When we look at the weapons that various countries are striving for, we can understand that what they value is the enrichment of aircraft, the development of chemical warfare equipment, and the increase in the power of guns and cannons. In order to remedy these, they are doing their best to research optical, electrical, and precision mechanical knowledge weapons, and various cars are used to replace horses. Mechanized corps have been discovered in various countries since several years ago. If we observe the situation of future wars in this way, it is very clear that a large amount of iron and a large amount of military supplies are needed from any aspect. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army fired 1.05 million shells in two years. In the Battle of Shenyang, the Japanese army fired 330,000 shells in two weeks. However, in the Battle of the Marne during the World War, the French army fired 1 million shells in one week. That is to say, the number of shells used by Japan in two years during the Russo-Japanese War was fired by the French army in one week. Furthermore, in the Battle of Sulm, the French army alone used 20 million shells in two weeks, while the British army used 14 million shells. As such, with so much iron falling on the enemy's position, just imagining these shells, where should these industries manufacture them during wartime? This question will inevitably arise immediately. In the Japanese army, there is only the arsenal. Of course, not many things can be made here. Therefore, it is impossible not to rely on private factories. This is just for bullets. However, clothing, rations, etc. also require a great amount. Other things, such as hygiene materials and veterinary materials, also require a considerable amount. It is ultimately impossible to manufacture these things in government-owned factories. Expanding capacity temporarily cannot be done in a short period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to use private factories. Other questions such as how to obtain raw materials, and if the products are manufactured, how should they be stored and where should they be transported? If you think about it, there will definitely be various other questions. These questions should be resolved in peacetime. It is impossible to prepare when the war breaks out. Therefore, we must prepare in peacetime. We call the plan for this kind of preparation military-industrial mobilization.</p>

According to reliable sources, as of the second day before yesterday, there had been no fighting. After You Guocai arrived in Shanghai, he stayed for several days because someone was detecting his whereabouts, and then took a boat south, going to Yunnan via Hong Kong. He arrived in Yunnan on the 16th of last month and met with Long Yun, the chairman of Yunnan. Long immediately replenished him with ammunition and firearms. You's troops, totaling more than 5,000 people, are now stationed in various counties in eastern Yunnan, such as Luoping, Shizong, Yiliang, and Pingyi, which are very close to the Guizhou border. You left Kunming on the 20th and went to Luoping to reorganize his troops. There is no report that the army has been mobilized. The Guizhou army Jiang Zaizhen's troops, which retreated into southern Sichuan, originally cooperated with You's troops and are still stationed in Nanchuan. However, Liu Xiang of Sichuan and Long Yun of Yunnan believe that the Guizhou army should not be stationed in neighboring provinces for a long time, and have respectively telegraphed Wang Jialie, the chairman of Guizhou, to ask You and Jiang's troops for residence so that they can return to their province.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Teng County is located in southern Shandong and was the State of Teng in the Spring and Autumn Period. Last year, nine Han Dynasty stone paintings were discovered in the county. They are antique and extremely precious. They have now been moved to the Provincial Library on the shore of Daming Lake in Jinan for preservation. Yesterday, the Education Department also received a telegram from Wei Xihong, an inspector in Teng County, reporting that fourteen Zhongding Pan Yi antiques were discovered in Dongan Shang Village in the county, and merchants are competing to buy them. The Education Department believes that the discovery of Zhongding Pan Yi and other antiques is very important, and Wei Xihong's report is brief and not detailed. Therefore, the county magistrate was ordered to report in detail that if the antiques were discovered by private individuals and have not been sold, they should be purchased at a price and returned to the public. If they have already been purchased by merchants, efforts should also be made to purchase them back for preservation to avoid loss. It is said that these antiques are relics of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties.</p>
<p>Since then, the county has been completely under the iron hooves of the bandits and has been used by the bandits as a Soviet area for a full six years. When Chairman Chiang personally came to Jiangxi to plan the fourth major encirclement and suppression campaign, he regarded the area as the source of the Red bandits in the country. The people of the three counties had been immersed in the Red Sea for a long time. Therefore, Wang Maode's division on the west bank of the Gan River, Li Zhenqiu and Ye Zhao's troops from Chongyi and Shangyou in southern Jiangxi, and Tao Guang's troops from Pingxiang were ordered to advance towards the three counties. Chen Guangzhong's troops from eastern Hunan were also transferred to advance from Cha Dong, forming a four-sided encirclement. At that time, the Red bandits entrenched in the area were Li Tianzhu's troops. Li appointed himself as the commander of the Xiang-Gan Military Region and commander of the pseudo-Eighth Army, commanding the pseudo-Twenty-first, Twenty-second, and Twenty-third Divisions, with about 3,000 to 4,000 guns. Their pseudo-organ was located in Yongxin City, and the bandits were distributed in Suichuan, Lianhua, Anfu, Wan'an, and various borders, appearing and disappearing on the west bank of the Gan River, looting on a large scale. After the general attack by the Gan, Yue, and Xiang armies, Wang's troops had recovered Ninggang, and Li's troops had captured the bandit nests in Wudoujiang and Huang'ao south of Suichuan, and joined Wang's troops to attack Yaqian. The bandits in the area bordering Suichuan, Wan'an, Shangyou, and Chongyi, because Li's bandits were under pressure, abandoned their old nest on the Gan-Xiang border and fled north. When Kong Hechong's pseudo-Sixteenth Army invaded Xinyu and Fenyi in February, Li's bandits attempted to cross the Yuan River and join Kong's troops, but Zhu Yaohua and Tao Guang cut them off, so they turned and fled southeast, invading Xiajiang and Xingan, and attempted to cooperate with the bandits in Yongfeng on the east bank of the Gan River. Fortunately, the troops from □□□□ and other places blocked and suppressed them from the □ area, and the bandits' cunning plan failed. Chen Guangzhong's troops, who entered Jiangxi from the Hunan border to raid the rear of the bandits, recovered Lianhua County on March 22. The remaining bandits were scattered like stray dogs. The police team of the county, which had fled to Pingxiang, had also returned to the county with the army. At this moment, the Gan, Yue, and Xiang armies have joined forces to attack Yongxin. Once Yongxin is recovered, there will be no counties in western Jiangxi that are completely occupied by bandits. However, two-thirds of the people in these counties have died. The fields and gardens have long been covered with weeds, and the houses are full of weeds. The broken and miserable scene cannot be described in words. At this moment, Xiong Shihui has appointed Li Zhengyi as the administrative inspector of the Tenth District, taking a detour through Hunan to clean up the ruins, save the dying, and heal the wounded.

<h3 id="e97">A False Alarm of Robbery at the Li Family in the City <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Li family's residence east of Aijia Bridge in the northern gate of the city was once robbed in the past. Unexpectedly, last night (the 1st) at about 9:00 p.m., the residence suddenly heard a very loud knocking sound on the back door. Because it was late at night and the location was remote, the family recalled the past and were like frightened birds. They knew it was not a good person and quickly tried to report to the police station by telephone. However, after shaking the phone for a long time, there was no response. They realized something was wrong and a family member climbed over the front wall and reported to the Public Security Bureau. The police rushed to the scene, but the person knocking on the door was nowhere to be found. However, it was observed that the telephone line had been cut. It can be seen that the bandits attempted to rob but failed.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Crackdown on Ferryboats in Conflicting Routes <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the Construction Department issued a license for inland steamships and ferryboats to ensure the safety of travelers. Those who obtained licenses complied with the regulations, but those who tried to be clever often used old-fashioned rowing boats modified with diesel engines and propellers, without a fixed route, competing with various boats for business, resulting in frequent capsizing and burning incidents. With the approval of the former Construction Bureau, it was decided to crack down on them. Now that the Construction Bureau has been abolished, the county government has found that the Xin Aili, Tianli, and Xinfeng boats traveling from Shanyang to Song, the Xingfei and two unnamed boats traveling from Tinglin to Song, and the Aili boat traveling from Jinshanwei to Song all conflict with the routes of the Bianli Company's boats and should be stopped immediately. The remaining existing motorized rowing boats should be reported for inspection within two weeks. Only after they are legal will they be allowed to travel.</p>

<p>The Ping Opera Research Association of the Zhu Jing People's Education Center in this county is rehearsing Ping Opera from March 30th to raise funds for the aviation patriotic donation. At about 7:00 p.m. on April 1st, an official on duty from the Shi Cheng District in this county, accompanied by four friends, entered the venue to watch the play without buying tickets. Shen Shixiong, the principal of the People's Education Center, advised them to buy tickets to enter the venue. The official on duty refused and slapped Principal Shen in the face. Principal Shen believed that the official on duty was so fierce and immediately asked the police officers of the County Public Security Bureau who were maintaining order on the scene to report to the County Bureau. At that time, the District Official was also watching the play at the scene and reported to the District Official. Unexpectedly, the District Official not only did not blame the official on duty, but instead questioned Principal Shen, which aroused public outrage among the audience. The scene became chaotic for a while. The staff in the venue reported to the County Government by telephone. Secretary Zhang of the County Government instructed the County Government to take them away, but the police officers of the County Public Security Bureau who were maintaining order on the scene did not dare to take them away because they saw that the District Official was on the scene. At that time, the crowd was excited. Seeing that the situation was not good, the District Official agreed to the County Public Security Bureau sending police to take them away, and Principal Shen also went to the County Public Security Bureau to report. It is now heard that all circles in the local area believe that the official on duty assaulted and humiliated public officials and destroyed the aviation patriotic movement, and unanimously advocate strict handling.</p>

<p>The silk reeling business in the city has failed year after year. The livelihood of farmers and the social economy have been bankrupted. The number of unemployed workers has reached 80,000 to 90,000. The future is particularly worrying. News came that the Taichang Silk Factory under Kuatang Bridge outside the South Gate also closed down yesterday. It is heard that the reason for its closure is also because the silk market is sluggish and it is difficult to maintain. It is also heard that one or two other silk factories will also have to close down within a few days. This is a bad phenomenon in the industrial and commercial circles.</p>

<p>Six Thousand Enemies Killed with Broadswords at Xifengkou</p>

<p>People Flock to the Battlefield to Rescue the Wounded</p>
<p>Urgently Needs Trucks, Requests Assistance with Purchase</p>
<p>In the Future, We Must Unanimously Embrace the Determination to Sacrifice</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying (Xiange), a member of the Beiping Military Sub-Committee, represents Song Zheyuan, the commander of the Twenty-ninth Army and commander-in-chief of the Third Army Corps.</p>
<p>He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning after coming south from the front line to seek assistance. He issued a written statement yesterday, which is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Song Zheyuan's Painful Words <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Zhenying has come south this time because since the Battle of Xifengkou, our army has received support and condolences from all walks of life. Our commander-in-chief, Song Gongmingxuan, specially sent Zhenying to various places in Beijing and Shanghai to report everything and to express his gratitude on his behalf. Since the fall of Rehe, many say that the disparity in military preparedness between the enemy and us is too great to fight. Commander-in-Chief Song set out under orders, saying painfully that any country must first have those who sacrifice before there can be a day of success. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army was also inferior to Russia, but it was able to sacrifice 20,000 brave men to fight for a fortress and thus defeat a strong enemy and leap to become a hero. Now that the disaster of the invaders is deep, it is a great opportunity for our soldiers to become martyrs. If our 40,000 comrades are all sacrificed for the survival of the country and the nation, then it can be considered a worthy death, and only in this way can it be worthy of the country's intention to cultivate soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Bloody Battle at Xifeng Kill the Enemy <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>When we set off, the enemy's Thirteenth and Fourteenth Brigades, attached with puppet Mongolian troops, had advanced rapidly and occupied the advantageous positions of the Great Wall at Xifengkou. Our army rushed 160 miles in eight hours to block the enemy head-on. The enemy occupied high ground and unleashed the power of cannons, airplanes, tanks, armored vehicles, and various new-style weapons, which could not be approached. Our army was caught off guard and had no fortifications to cover them. They charged repeatedly, but no one survived. Commander-in-Chief Song personally led Division Commander Feng Zhi'an, Division Commander Zhang Zizhong, Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu, etc., to command on the battlefield, and fought a bloody battle for three days and nights. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Brigade Commander Zhao was wounded but did not retreat. On the fourth night, it was decided to divide the troops and use a detour strategy. Brigade Commander Zhao, with his wounds wrapped, led his team around 50 miles to attack the enemy's rear. Brigade Commander Tong Zeguang also joined the attack with his troops, and surrounded the enemy. It was late at night, and our army waved broadswords and slashed wildly. They wiped out the enemy's infantry and cavalry battalions and charged into the artillery positions, seizing 18 enemy cannons and using them to attack the remaining enemy. They also set fire to more than 200 enemy carts loaded with supplies and food. Seven of their tanks and five armored vehicles were also completely intercepted. Because the mountains were dangerous and difficult to transport, they were either blown up or buried to prevent them from returning. In this battle, our army suffered more than 3,000 casualties, and the enemy's deaths and injuries were more than double that of us, and the dangerous terrain of the Great Wall at Xifengkou was completely recovered by us.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Our Army Approaches Kuancheng <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>After this setback, the enemy dared not attack head-on, but used a force of one or two regiments to attack Dongjiakou on our left flank and Panjiakou on our right flank, but were all defeated by our army. Unable to vent their anger, they massacred three nearby villages. Because Luowenyu was a key location in our army's rear, they added an elite brigade to launch a fierce attack on the area. Division Commander Liu Ruming rushed to intercept them. The enemy used their weapons to cover their infantry and cavalry, who attacked our position fiercely. Our army rolled forward with broadswords under a dense hail of bullets, fighting a bloody battle. Regiment Commander Li Zengzhi had his leg broken by a cannonball, but he still sat firmly in a pool of blood without retreating, and cut open three enemy lines, capturing more than a dozen machine guns and killing countless enemies. Our army suffered the loss of three regimental commanders, four battalion commanders, and more than 2,000 soldiers, and the enemy was defeated and retreated more than 50 miles. Now our army at Xifengkou is pressing on Kuancheng, and our army at Luowenyu is occupying the Banbishan area. Zhenying received a telegram from the front yesterday in Beijing that two artillery battalions of the Japanese army (approximately equivalent to two of our battalions) were fiercely bombarding our army's positions outside Xifengkou with 500 shells. Most of their infantry and cavalry units are mobilizing, and it seems that their reinforcements have arrived and they are launching a large-scale attack again. Our army vows to fight to the death.</p>
<h3 id="e109">People Share the Same Hatred of the Enemy <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Zhenying has repeatedly accompanied Dean Shao Yuan, Minister Kong Xiangxi, and Vice Minister Yu Feipeng to the front line to comfort the soldiers. The weather on the frontier is extremely cold, and even heavy fur coats cannot keep them warm. The soldiers are wearing short clothes and straw sandals, standing in the wind and snow without any sign of weariness. Upon hearing the words of comfort, they are all motivated a hundredfold. The local people are also helping with hot blood. Every time there is a battle, the people rush to the battlefield to rescue the wounded. When launching an attack, they compete to be guides. Even when the sound of cannons is booming, none of them run away. When asked why they are not afraid, they reply, "If our commander-in-chief doesn't drive away the little devils, we would have been slaves of a conquered nation long ago. The commander-in-chief is not afraid of death, so why should we be afraid of anything?" Also, at the beginning of the war, there were no hospitals in the rear, and thousands of wounded soldiers relied entirely on charitable organizations to find ways to rescue them, running around and taking care of them as if they were their own flesh and blood. All of this is due to the hatred of the enemy in the fight against foreign aggression, and I dare not say that the discipline is more strict because of this.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Urgent Need for Trucks <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>In short, spiritual strength overcomes material strength, and the sacrifice is naturally very great. Without sufficient preparation, it is not enough to talk about long-term resistance. At present, the central government has planned to replenish supplies, medicine, and bullets. However, for the transportation of 400 miles from Beiping to Xifengkou, it is entirely dependent on mules and human labor. Wounded soldiers have to spend four or five days on the way to reach the rear, which often leads to death due to delays in medical treatment. If we can get more trucks, all difficulties can be reduced. What's more, the past mistake is that every time the enemy is preparing for war, we try to live in peace. When the enemy comes to attack, we are willing to retreat. The repeated loosening and tightening has been taken advantage of by the enemy. This is the same mistake as the Southern Song Dynasty's avoidance of the Jin.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Determination to Have the Enemy but Not Me <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The plan for the future is that the whole country should be united and determined to have the enemy but not me, and everyone should have the idea of destroying their homes to relieve the country's difficulties. When the enemy comes, we should fight to the death, and even if they don't come, we should attack. Regardless of the superiority or inferiority of materials, regardless of the amount of sacrifice, we will not stop until we have recovered the lost land. The domestic economy of the Japanese invaders is on the verge of collapse, and social thoughts are surging forward. Although a few warlords are still struggling and unable to get off the tiger, the people of their country are tired of war and afraid of war. If we can fight for another year or two, they will inevitably collapse completely. The final victory will surely belong to us. No matter what sacrifices are made, our army will not hesitate. If we are not willing to fight or dare not fight, we will retreat and the enemy will advance deeper and deeper. Apart from national subjugation and extermination, there is no other good fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Tang Youren's Speech <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The central government believes that the national crisis is urgent and is preparing to concentrate the national strength to resist Japan, that is, to open up political power and cooperate with the people of the country. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee recently resolved to convene the National Assembly in advance and ordered the Central Political Council to discuss the principles of the organization law and election law. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Tang Youren, the Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, at his residence in Shanghai yesterday. According to Tang, after the proposal to convene the National Assembly in advance was passed by the Standing Committee, preparations will be made to formulate the organization law and election law of the Assembly to form the basis for the establishment of the Assembly. The method is that the Central Political Conference will decide on the principles and then hand them over to the Legislative Yuan to draft detailed regulations. The Central Political Council has decided to hold a meeting this Wednesday to discuss the principles, and then send them to the Legislative Yuan for drafting. When the reporter asked about the central government's attitude towards Kijuro Shidehara's visit, Tang replied that the central government allows him to come and go without expressing any opinion, and Shidehara and the current rulers of Japan belong to two factions and will not have a special mission. Mr. Wang has officially gone to the Executive Yuan and has no intention of coming to Shanghai in the coming days.</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Workers Union</p>
<h3 id="e113">Yesterday's Welcome for Zhu Ziqiao <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Reports on the Situation at the Front</p>
<p>The People Should be Resolved to Resist</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union held a welcome meeting for Mr. Zhu Ziqiao in the grand hall on the third floor of the Shanghai Postal Administration. About 500 members attended to listen to Mr. Zhu's report on the situation at the front. The meeting began with an opening speech by Chairman Cao Xunye, followed by Mr. Zhu's report. He humbly stated that while the welcome was appreciated, reporting was his duty. He explained that his work at the front was based on the position of the people. Initially, he faced some difficulties, but the government provided various conveniences such as transportation and passports. While he couldn't claim any significant achievements, he could reassure the people on three points: First, that the people would not submit to the violent Japanese; second, that the League of Nations would know that the Chinese people were still determined to resist; and third, that the righteous armies were lying in wait in the three northeastern provinces, causing the Japanese to be exhausted and unable to carry out their planned invasion. He attributed the failure of the righteous armies to a lack of coordination between the various forces and transportation difficulties, primarily due to a shortage of heavy-duty trucks, with most transportation relying on camels, which was extremely slow. Fortunately, important roads are now being built and made level. The front urgently needs heavy-duty trucks, and gasoline is also in short supply. Additionally, cooked food, shirts, shoes, and socks are all needed, and he urged the people to actively contribute. In conclusion, China now has only one way out: resistance. Failure to resist will inevitably lead to national subjugation. He mentioned that he would stay for another day or two before returning to the front to continue fighting the enemy. After Mr. Zhu's report, he was accompanied by members of the union's executive committee to the Club on Bazi Road for a visit and light refreshments. During the occasion, there was a detailed discussion on matters such as the dispatch of postal worker rescue teams to the front lines for rescue work.</p>
<p>Representative of the Jilin Self-Defense Army</p>
<h3 id="e114">Letter Reporting on the Recent Situation in Jilin Province <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Mishan and Fujin Counties Have Been Recaptured by Our Army</p>
<p>The Daily News Agency reports that the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association in this city received a letter yesterday from the Jilin Self-Defense Army, Department of Li Du, represented by the □ Brigade Commander Chen Zongdai, who arrived in Ping from the Jiandao area. The letter reported that our army had recaptured Mishan and Fujin counties. The details regarding the current situation in Jilin Province are as follows:</p>
<p>Current Situation in Jilin Province: There are still over 30,000 soldiers in our army in eastern Jilin, including the □ Brigade of Xu Guoguang with over 3,000 soldiers stationed at □□ to guard the artillery camp. The □ Brigade of Chen Zongdai has five regiments, including the □ Regiment led by Sun Rongjiu, the □ Regiment led by Li Jiantang, the □ Regiment led by Li Huatang, the □ Regiment led by Zhang Shutian, and the □□□ Regiment led by Zhao Lianshan, totaling over 12,000 soldiers stationed in the □□□□□□□ three counties. In the middle, the □ Brigade of Lu Yongcai has over 4,000 soldiers stationed around □□□□□. The □ Road Commander Li Xiaotong has a force including the □ Regiment, the □ Detachment led by Wang Hongru, the □ Regiment led by Commander Fan, the □ Regiment led by Li Shaozong, the martial arts regiment led by Duan Yunge, and the □ Detachment led by Zhou Yunsheng, totaling 7,000 soldiers stationed at □□. The □ Detachment led by Wang Yong has over 4,000 soldiers stationed at □□. The armies have enough firearms, but a lack of ammunition and no source of supply. They are in remote mountainous areas with sparse population, making it difficult to obtain supplies. They endure cold and hunger, yet vow to remain steadfast and continue the cause of their predecessors. The armies are in contact with each other, waiting for an opportunity to strike at the enemy.</p>
<p>Battle Situation at the Front: My brigade is the □ Brigade of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, and I, Brigade Commander Chen Zongdai, courtesy name Dongshan, have followed General Commander Li for many years. I am loyal, brave, upright, and skilled in strategy. Since the September 18th Incident, I have been ordered to defend Yilan. Last March, I attacked the counties of Dalelemi, Fangzheng, and Yanshou, and recaptured them after over 20 days of fighting. In April, I attacked Zhuhe in a bloody battle lasting three days and nights, and it was captured. Later, the enemy mobilized large numbers of Japanese and puppet troops for reinforcements and counterattacks, with the support of airplanes and tanks. We were unable to resist due to the disparity in equipment and retreated to Liangzhuhe. After General Commander Li retreated to Tulongshan, I retreated to Boli County in May. The General Commander was stationed in Lishu Town. In August, the Japanese launched a general offensive on Boli. Our army swore to defend it and fought fiercely for four days and five nights, finally repelling the enemy. In November, Brigade Commander Ma Xianzhang of the Nalu Hasui Line Modao Shi was betrayed by Liu Wankui. The Japanese took the opportunity to invade on a large scale, with airplane bombing and armored vehicle pursuit. General Commander Li retreated into Russian territory when it became impossible to hold out. I was ordered to continue defending Boli. On the 14th day of the first lunar month this year, over 3,000 Japanese and puppet troops and 11 armored vehicles attacked. There was a fierce battle at Sandao Gang, with several charges against the enemy. Over a dozen Japanese soldiers and 167 puppet soldiers were killed, and over 40 enemy horses were killed. On our side, one company commander was killed and four soldiers were wounded. After 11 days of fighting, we were unable to hold out due to worn-out equipment and exhausted ammunition, so we retreated to preserve our strength. The enemy pursued us to Boli and engaged in battle for one day, killing and wounding eight Japanese soldiers. We then retreated to the mountainous area at the intersection of Qizihe and □□□□□□ counties, planning to coordinate with various armies for further action. On the 15th of this month, I, as a representative, arrived in Harbin and received a report that our army had recaptured Mishan and that Wang Yong's troops had occupied Fujin. The Japan-Manchukuo Daily News also reported this, stating that 18 Japanese heavy-duty trucks and over 100 Japanese soldiers were intercepted by our regiment commander Li Huatang between Dalelemi and Dongzigou, with all the Japanese soldiers being captured. The Japanese army is currently in a state of panic in Harbin, and the Japanese army does not dare to advance east.</p>
<p>Taking the Opportunity to Recover: I, as a representative, was ordered by Brigade Commander Chen to travel to Guan Nei to convey the recent situation at the front and request ammunition and supplies. I departed from Qizihe in Mishan territory on the 15th of this month in disguise and traveled to Harbin, then transferred to Dalian, and arrived in Ping yesterday. Currently, Yure is in a state of emergency, and the Japanese troops are all heading west. The eastern part of Jilin, including Mishan, Boli, Baoqing, Raoyang, Hulin, Tongjiang, Fujin, Zhechuan, Yilan, Fangzheng, Bin County, Zhuhe, and Yanshou counties, is sparsely populated, with only about 1,000 Japanese soldiers and about 30,000 puppet soldiers. It is possible to take this opportunity to rise up and recover the lost territories, but there is a lack of ammunition, clothing, and food. Although the villagers express sympathy, they are unable to provide supplies due to years of disasters, and the soldiers are extremely impoverished. We earnestly request the rapid arrangement of relief measures in order to coordinate the various departments for large-scale activities and to recover the lost territories.</p>
<p>Chen Youren's Advice</p>
<h3 id="e115">Indians Boycott Japanese Goods <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Dominate Asia</p>
<p>China and India Are Under Threat</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that Chen Youren, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, recently stated that the United States has an obligation and responsibility to assist China, which was published in various Chinese and foreign newspapers. Yesterday, he wrote another article elaborating on the Manchurian issue and the relationship to the future defense of India, calling on the Indian people to unanimously boycott violent Japan. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Japan's attempt to destroy the international system that has always maintained China's territorial and administrative integrity is of great importance to India, especially to the Indian National Congress. The British began with the conquest of India, followed by the force of historical evolution, becoming custodians. When this custodial task is completed, there will inevitably be a day when they withdraw from India. Moreover, in the face of revolutionary changes that are about to change the existing social order around the world, the event is becoming increasingly urgent. The British abandonment of Indian rule will not be far off. Once realized, the problem of defending India from aggression will arise. In the past, those who invaded India either came overland from the northwest or crossed the sea from the west. However, from now on, once India's independence is realized and the true government controlling the peninsula is transferred into the hands of Indians, the land danger will only be the invasion of border barbarians. A small number of advanced mechanized troops, with elite aviation as the main force, will be more than enough to deal with it. However, the danger at sea is far more terrifying. At that time, it will no longer come from the west but from the east, threatened by the power of the Japanese navy. Since the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was first renewed in 1905 and renewed a second time in 1911, India has officially entered the orbit of Japanese naval power. Later, as a result of the Indian boycott of British goods and the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods, Japan's trade in India made astonishing progress. Therefore, the relationship between the Japanese naval power and India became increasingly deep-rooted and difficult to eliminate. China's boycott of Japanese goods in order to resist Japan's military aggression in Manchuria is necessary because China's purchase of Japanese goods is tantamount to suicide, providing the Japanese with funds for the war to conquer China. However, the losses suffered by Japan from the Chinese boycott are now being compensated in India. Today, the Indian market is as important to Japan as the Chinese market, and it will gradually occupy a very important position in the Japanese industrial and commercial economy. Just as Manchuria is called Japan's lifeline, it is not impossible for India to be called Japan's other lifeline. From this perspective, Japan's hegemony over the Asian continent will also pose the same dangers to India as those encountered by China.</p>
<p>By then, preventing the development of Indian industry so as not to hinder Japan's complete exploitation of the Indian market will be an important interest for the Japanese. However, the Japanese plan to obtain control of India in the future naturally does not intend to transplant its surplus population, because India has no open land for the Japanese to live in. Therefore, the main purpose of its plot in India is to occupy the complete monopoly of the Indian market in the future and prevent India from becoming an industrialized country, so that what India makes itself will not compete with Japanese goods even in its own market. If Japan's war of conquest against China is successful today, then after the British abandon their rule over India in the future, Japan can obtain military advantages and material resources to invade India (considering the necessity of the Indian market for Japanese industry, this move is inevitable). It is expected that the Indian people, especially the nationalistic Indian people, will be able to clearly understand that the Manchurian issue is of great importance to India's freedom and security. If the Indian people allow the Japanese to invade their markets to facilitate the Japanese conquest of China, China will inevitably suffer fatal disasters. However, if China suffers today, India will suffer the same tomorrow. If the Indian people can cooperate with China to jointly boycott Japanese goods, even if this move is enough to alleviate the Indian boycott of British goods (in fact, this move is no longer necessary for the Indian people to promote independence), and when danger comes in the future, there will be a powerful China to help India by attacking the Japanese invasion of India from the side. This move is deeply related to the whole of India. Therefore, I request that the nationalistic elements of India, through the National Congress, mobilize the Indian people to truly understand the threat of Japan to Asia and jointly shoulder the work of the government. I also ask other Indians in the parliament to raise the issue of Japanese aggression, regarding it as affecting the current economic security and future national defense, as an important issue for India today. This is what we Chinese people are looking forward to immensely today.</p>
<p>Aviation to Save the Nation Movement</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association's Aviation to Save the Nation Fundraising Committee has set up a basic team for the sake of concentrating its forces. Each team is responsible for raising over 5,000 yuan. It is heard that the various basic teams of the association are actively raising funds, and the amount paid in as of yesterday has reached over 50,000 yuan. Here is a record of the comparisons: Wang Dongyuan Team: 5,815.964 yuan; Jin Tingsun Team: 5,000 yuan; Zhu Meixian Team: 5,000 yuan; Wang Wenhan Team: 4,200 yuan; Wu Zhihao Team: 3,819.5 yuan; Jin Runxiang Team: 3,708.7 yuan; Wu Yaqin Team: 3,542.81 yuan; Zhang Jiguang Team: 3,330 yuan; Yu Qiaqing Team: 2,500 yuan; Sun Meitang Team: 1,754 yuan; Chen Shuzhi Team: 1,600 yuan; Mao Heyuan Team: 1,552 yuan; Zhou Qiankang Team: 1,500 yuan; Zhou Zongliang Team: 1,000 yuan; Wang Boyuan Team: 1,000 yuan; Yuan Ludeng Team: 1,000 yuan; Xu Maotang Team: 1,000 yuan; Xu Shengchan Team: 823 yuan; Liu Pingsan Team: 814 yuan; Yu Baosan Team: 200 yuan. Those that have not yet been raised and paid include Fu Xiaoan Team, Sun Hengfu Team, Qin Runqing Team, Yu Zuoting Team, Liu Hongsheng Team, and Wu Qiting Team, etc. It is heard that they are also actively carrying out their work, and the total amount raised in the future will definitely exceed the original goal, because the team leaders are all famous people from Ningbo who are enthusiastic and patriotic, and their call will naturally have special results. The Shanghai Municipal Shoe Industry Trade Association organized a fundraising team for aviation to save the nation, and the members of the city's industries generously donated. The team that achieved the best fundraising results was the Hongkou branch. The original donation amount was 1,000 yuan. The Hongkou branch's fundraising donations from fellow industries are recorded below: Hengchangxiang Wang Jilin: 100 yuan each; Huang Zhengzai, Zhang Jintang, Jia Renfang, Chen Ruzhao: 85 yuan each; New Central: 80 yuan; Zhou Mengyun: 50 yuan; Zhongnan, Lu Yongchang: 40 yuan each; Tongfutai, Honglu: 30 yuan each; Zhang Afu, Wang Chunxing, Dalu, Xinguang, Zuxia, Delixiang, Ruihuaxiang: 20 yuan each; Tiansheng, Wuxinglong, Jinhua, Wushunxing, Baoxing, Wang Yongfa, Xu Maotang: 10 yuan each. The donations from the above individuals have exceeded the quota.</p>

<h3 id="e118">French Army Conducts Simulated War Exercises <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Army Commander Laipangna Explains the Process</p>
<p>The Zilin News reports that yesterday (the 1st) afternoon, near Jiaotong University, the sound of machine guns and artillery fire was suddenly heard for about half an hour. However, no bullets were seen flying out. It turned out that the French army was conducting a simulated war exercise, and all the ammunition fired was blank. Later, after the enemy was driven out of the boundary and the defending army won, Colonel Laipangna, the French army commander stationed in Shanghai, gathered his subordinates to explain the simulated war exercise. According to his plan, it was assumed that the enemy invaded the French Concession from Columbia Road, penetrated 500 meters into Haig Road. The infantry defending the concession was divided into two teams to resist. However, because the enemy had set up three machine gun nests and several light artillery positions, they could not repel the enemy, so they urgently summoned tank assistance. Five tanks arrived at 2:30 PM, and the simulated war exercise began. The tanks were then divided into two groups to destroy the enemy's formations in the open areas north and south of the road. The infantry followed, but after advancing about 100 meters, the infantry was blocked by enemy fire because the tanks failed to detect two enemy machine gun nests. Therefore, three tanks returned to eliminate the machine gun nests after driving back most of the enemy, and two tanks pretended to be damaged and raised yellow flags. After the two machine gun nests were eliminated, the tanks rushed forward again, and the infantry followed. Subsequently, there were no more major difficulties. They recaptured the remaining 400 meters and drove the enemy west of Haig Road. The main purpose of this exercise was to test the effectiveness of the tanks. Several officers from the US Marine Corps were also sent to observe.</p>
<p>Wu Kaisheng's Speech</p>
<h3 id="e119">The International Situation and Our National Policy <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining Treaties on the One Hand and Recovering Lost Territory on the Other</p>
<p>We Can Only Face Japan If We Unite With All Countries</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Wu Kaisheng, a secretary of the League of Nations, gave a speech at the Shanghai People's Education Center on the diplomatic policies that our country should adopt in the future and the diplomacy that our country should use to deal with Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency recorded his speech as follows:</p>
<p>Classification of International Diplomacy: From the closed-door era to the present, relations between countries have developed, and international negotiations have arisen accordingly. The policies adopted internationally are, first, to befriend distant countries and attack nearby ones. Japan's diplomacy takes this approach, attacking China nearby and befriending Europe and the United States from afar. As for the policies of the European countries, they take the approach of befriending nearby countries and attacking distant ones. The recent meeting between British Prime Minister MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini discussed the following issues: 1. Revising the Treaty of Versailles to achieve equality in German armaments; 2. Adopting a consistent trend in colonial policies toward countries outside of Europe. This is the approach of attacking nearby countries and befriending distant ones.</p>
<p>Trends in Diplomatic Policy: International diplomacy initially tended toward alliances, such as the Franco-Belgian alliance, the German-Austrian alliance, and the Anglo-American alliance before the war. However, because of alliances, wars broke out. Then, in 1914, the Paris Peace Conference was held, and US President Wilson advocated the organization of an alliance to have all countries around the world join hands to stop the war. If one country invaded another, all the others would come out to intervene. However, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, countries have once again felt the failure of the alliance policy. Thus, the trend in diplomacy has shifted from alliance to friendship, such as the recent Anglo-Italian fraternization.</p>
<p>Form of Diplomatic Policy: Diplomatic forms are divided into four factions: (1) the Continental Faction; (2) the Anglo-American Faction; (3) the Non-European and American Faction (such as Russia, Turkey, Japan, etc.); (4) the South American Faction. The Continental Faction is led by France, and several countries in Europe, such as Romania, are under its control. Italy is extremely uneasy about France's hegemony in Europe, so it is helping Germany to revise the European war treaty with France. Italy also hopes that the French and German factions will compete again in order to solve its land development. However, France must maintain its position in Europe, so it is plotting to control the European continent, and thus the Italian-French situation may explode at any time. In such an environment in Europe, there is naturally no time to take care of the Far East issue. It only needs to express itself in the Sino-Japanese Incident. The Anglo-American Faction, the United States and the United Kingdom, are of the same race and have been inseparable in history. Although there are occasional conflicts in emotions, their rights abroad are the same. The reason why the United Kingdom and Japan are allied is that the United Kingdom wants to use Japan to obtain interests in East Asia, and Japan also wants to use the United Kingdom to control the United States. However, this is not the case now, because the United States is extremely concerned about Japan's hegemony in the Pacific, so it is actively cooperating with the United Kingdom. The United States' commercial rights in the Far East are not as good as Japan's, and it cannot deal with Japan, but if Japan forces it to the point of desperation, it may not be able to attack Japan and help China. The Non-European countries faction includes Russia, Turkey, Egypt, India, etc. Turkey and Russia are now close to each other after the two rose again after World War One. Russia and China are bordering countries, and it does not want Japan to monopolize its interests in Liaoning and Jilin. However, its Five-Year Plan has not been completely successful, and it is also under the control of the European Allies, so it dares not rashly wage war with Japan alone. This depends on what our country does. If our country is determined to resist Japan, Russia will definitely be able to help China. Although India and Egypt are alienated from China due to geographical relations, they are both oppressed nations and will naturally sympathize with China. In addition, there is the South American Faction, which is very far away from China and has been plagued by internal strife in recent years, so it can do nothing but help morally. However, our country should also pay attention because the commercial rights in the South Pacific in the future are related to our country. Outlook After Japan Withdraws from the League of Nations: The diplomatic situation after Japan withdraws from the League of Nations changes from unity to division. In other words, the diplomacy of the past was unified diplomacy, and the diplomacy of the future will be divided diplomacy. However, Japan is also aware of the diplomatic isolation after withdrawing from the League of Nations, so it is trying to remedy it by sending envoys to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the United States, and other countries to lobby for diplomatic assistance from various countries. But no matter what, the provisions of Articles 1 and 3 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., it must still comply with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant within two years) must still be observed. Therefore, the direct conflict between the League of Nations and Japan in the future will be over the mandate of the islands in the South Pacific. Whether the mandated islands will be handed over to the League of Nations and whether the League of Nations will hand them over to Germany are all issues.</p>
<p>Our Diplomatic Policies: In such an unfavorable environment, our country's diplomatic policies must, on the one hand, maintain the League of Nations Treaty, and on the other hand, actively recover the lost territory. Whether all countries in the world will help our country because of the situation is a question that our country's diplomatic authorities urgently need to study. If there are those who help us now, then Japan's future will definitely fail.</p>
<p>How Will Our Country Deal With Japan?: How will our country deal with Japan? The most important thing is to unite with the countries of the world, most importantly the United States and Russia, and then the United Kingdom and even Germany and Italy. The United States does not want Japan to dominate the Pacific, and its psychology is the same as ours, so it will definitely be able to help us. Russia is very close to Liaoning and Jilin. When the Liaoning Incident occurs, Russia must come out and speak out. Although there are rifts between China and Russia, Russia will definitely sympathize with China between China, Russia, and Japan. The United Kingdom and Italy are each willing to occupy a seat in the Far East, and they are also willing to be friends with China. Germany is famous for its machinery, and if it can unite with Germany, it will definitely have direct and indirect benefits in military affairs.</p>
<p>Japan Is the One Who Created the Great War: In short, in the current world situation, if peaceful methods are ineffective in recovering Liaodong, then there is only recourse to force. If we are unfortunate enough to formally declare war, then our country will sacrifice because of this, and Japan's sacrifice will be even greater. In the future, the responsibility for creating the world war will of course be borne by Japan. On the one hand, we Chinese must have the ambition to recover the lost territory of the three northeastern provinces, and on the other hand, we must strive for world justice and humanity.</p>
<p>Qian Xin zhi Denies</p>
<p>[Rumors That the President of the Central Bank Will Be Replaced&gt;</p>
<p>Yesterday's report said that Finance Minister Song Ziwen, who is currently in Beijing, feels that coordinating financial affairs is a heavy burden and intends to resign as president of the Central Bank, recommending former Vice Minister of Finance Qian Yongming to succeed him. It is also said that the general manager and deputy general manager will also be replaced. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Mr. Qian at his residence, who said that the Central Bank has been well-managed since Minister Song became president, so why would it be replaced? He also said it would be appropriate to continue to have Song manage it. It is completely inaccurate that he will succeed him. Minister Song has not contacted him in any way. He is also a director of the Central Bank, and he is very busy with the duties of the Four Banks Reserve, so he has no time to hold other positions.</p>

<p>Received Thank You Telegram from Tang Juwu</p>
<p>And Reports on Military Situation</p>
<p>The Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang-Jehol Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram from Tang Juwu yesterday thanking the association for its relief. The original text is recorded below: Shanghai Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang-Jehol Volunteer Army Support Association, Public Overseer, I am grateful for your telegram and that the 2,000 yuan in national currency that was remitted has already been received in full and immediately sent to the front lines. During this Battle of Rehe, just as our army was rushing back to Liaodong, the Rehe Incident suddenly occurred in Chaoyang County, so we engaged in battle with the enemy. There were four formal charges and three minor contacts, for a total of seven bloody battles. There were heavy casualties. I am grateful for the relief from your association. However, the uses for funds by this army include secretly dispatching loyal comrades to the old departments in Liaodong to secretly show strategies and issuing travel expenses. Within Rehe territory, funds are used to purchase provisions, clothing, and expenses for wounded soldiers. Your association members have always had patriotic enthusiasm. If you can continue to provide full relief, I will lead my troops to attack again, wrapped in horsehide, without fear of death. Even if I am the only one left, I will resist the Japanese devils for a long time and never lose heart. However, I regret that the rumors spread by traitors who seek to undermine us cannot be completely eliminated. This spring, there was a grand plan for the old departments in Liaodong, but more than 20 comrades were arrested at the seaport in Dalian, and the military secrets were leaked, and everything turned into a soap bubble, which is regrettable. In the future, there will be other plans, and there will be developments in less than three months. Currently, the families of anti-Japanese comrades in Liaodong are having a difficult time in Ping, so I hope that you will provide extra relief. This is what I pray for. Tang Juwu, Commander of the Liaoning Ning People's Self-Defense Army, kowtows frugally.</p>

<p>Sending Letters to Various Organizations to Solicit慰勞品</p>
<p>丨Large Quantities of Military Supplies Have Been Sealed and Shipped to Ping丨</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association previously appointed directors Li Cishan and Feng Shaoshan to go north to慰勞 the anti-Japanese soldiers. Now, because Li Cishan is about to go to Duolun and Feng Shaoshan is also returning to Beijing, the association has decided to appoint an additional director, Chen Ya'fu, to go north to慰勞 in order to facilitate communication. Yesterday, letters were sent to various organizations to solicit goods. The letter stated: "The Japanese寇 are intensifying their aggression, occupying our three provinces, seizing our榆關, and recently attacking our熱河, directly approaching the Great Wall. Their wolfish ambitions will never cease. Defending the country and protecting the people depends solely on military force. Now, our government authorities have made a resolute decision to resist. Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, Shang Zhen, and Xu Tingyao's armies have all taken up positions on the front lines. The Song army is engaged in a bloody battle at喜峯口, demonstrating a spirit of advancing without retreating, annihilating Japanese寇 and repeatedly achieving meritorious deeds. The Sun army is fighting in western熱, approaching承德, the Shang army has recovered冷口 and is firmly defending its position, and the Xu army is deploying in古北, seeking opportunities to counterattack the three provinces and退熱. The various volunteer armies are either fighting in western熱 or assisting in defending the Great Wall. All the armies on the front lines are resisting砲火 with flesh and blood, making enormous sacrifices, and suffering from wounds and illnesses. Our loyal and courageous soldiers' hardships, injuries, and losses all depend on the慰勞 of our people in the rear. Our association has already sent Li Cishan and Feng Shaoshan north in succession. Now, we are continuing to send Chen Ya'fu to慰勞. In addition to separately soliciting and transporting automobiles, medicine, and materials, if your association has any items to慰勞 the anti-Japanese soldiers on the front lines, you can hand them over to our association representatives to take to the front lines for use. We are sending this special letter to you, hoping that you will consider it and reply. This is addressed to the various charitable organizations in Shanghai, the Northeast Refugee Joint Association, the Red Cross Society, the Used Clothing Industry Association, the New Medicine Industry Association, etc."</p>

<p>Held at the蓬萊戲院</p>
<p>Welcoming all the Children of the City</p>
<p>Joint Announcement by Four Bureaus</p>
<p>Since the central government stipulated that April 4th of each year is Children's Memorial Day, tomorrow is the third celebration. Regarding the celebration methods, the municipal government authorities have ordered the Public Security, Social Affairs, Health, and Education bureaus to jointly organize the Shanghai Municipal Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee with various local institutions and organizations, and to formulate various memorial methods as follows:</p>
<p>(Celebration Methods) The Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee has now decided to hold a gathering at the South City蓬萊大戲院 from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM tomorrow to welcome children from all over the city and perform various entertainment programs such as spoken drama, dance,雙簧, comedy, and movies. Children under the age of 16 can enter without tickets. At the same time, the municipal government will issue a notice to all stores in the city to hold special great discounts for Children's Day. Hospitals will provide free vaccinations, and parks in the Chinese and foreign concessions will also be open at the same time, allowing children to enter and visit for free. Major newspapers will collect articles on protecting children's health and issue special publications.</p>
<p>(Notice to the Whole City) Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya, Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, and Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan yesterday also jointly issued a letter to the parents of children throughout the city (details omitted above). The government's emphasis on treating children well is because children are the vitality of the country and the life of the nation. Today's adults are the children of the past, and today's children will be the adults of the future. Children inherit the careers of adult society, continue to promote and create, maintain and promote the civilization of society. Their responsibilities are both heavy and great. Adults should respect and cherish them. At present, our country is in trouble, and most of the relief depends on adults. However, in order to permanently eliminate foreign aggression and promote national glory, it is necessary to do everything possible to plan for children all over the country, to ensure their survival and development, to strengthen their bodies and enlighten their minds, so as to achieve the permanent effect of internal security and external defense. Our bureau, etc., are aware of this, so we are happy to advocate and commemorate the commendable Children's Day. From now on, the organization for the permanent welfare of children in this city has been planned by our bureau, etc., and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval after being approved by the Preparatory Committee for the celebration of Children's Day. I am afraid that the parents of ordinary children in society are not yet fully aware of this, so this is a special announcement.</p>

<p>The Pickled Meat and Ham Industries</p>
<h3 id="e128">Actively Oppose Inspection <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Industry to Advocate Unity</p>
<p>A Letter to Various Business Associations to Ask for Aid</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau is re-implementing the inspection of pickled meat and ham products. Although the fee has been reduced to 30 cents, the Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Association believes that this case has been ordered to be revoked by the Executive Yuan, so how can it be held again? Therefore, it actively opposes it. On the one hand, it urges the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan to request the fundamental revocation according to the previous approval. On the other hand, it sends a telegram to the industry in various places to advocate unity and to various business associations in this city to give sympathy and assistance. The two documents are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Various Places Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Shandong, Rizhao, Nanjing, Yangzhou, Jinhua, Lanxi, Rugao, Taixing, Linpu, Dongyang, Yiwu, Pujiang, Yongkang, Local Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Associations, Greetings. Since the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau last year intended to implement the inspection of pickled meat and ham products, our association, etc., believes that this matter is not necessary to be held. We have stated the reasons and requested the revocation, but we have not been invited to approve it. Therefore, our association had no choice but to send representatives to Beijing to petition. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry approved the order to revoke it in accordance with laws and regulations. Unexpectedly, within just three months of the approval, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice on March 30 that it would implement the inspection from April 1st. There were only two days between the announcement and the date of implementation, and our industry, etc., was not notified in advance. The matter was rushed and surprising. If various places follow suit, one place for one inspection and one place for one fee, then the burden will be ten times greater than the previous likin. For the sake of the future of the industry, in addition to urging the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to uphold justice based on the facts, we are sending a special telegram to you, hoping that your industry will jointly strive for this matter of vital interest to achieve the purpose of revocation. This is very much expected. We respectfully send this telegram and wait for a reply. Shanghai Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>A Letter to Various Associations To All Industry Associations in the City, Greetings. Respectfully, our industry is unfortunate because the commodities it operates are suddenly being paid special attention by the Municipal Health Bureau, which intends to implement inspection work, and before the goods enter the market, an inspection fee of 50 cents per 100 catties must be paid first. Our industry still believes that when the two kinds of foods, pickled meat and ham, are collected and made, they are salted and soaked once in a tank and exposed to the sun once, so they can be stored for a long time and there is nothing unsanitary about them. Moreover, according to our country's customs, ham is the only side dish for those who are sick, so our association has repeatedly called for the revocation based on the facts. Later, the Ministry of Industry and the Executive Yuan approved the revocation in accordance with the Commodity Inspection Law (the original approval photo is attached separately). However, the Municipal Health Bureau insisted on doing it, so the inspection facilities were re-implemented in this city just three days after the approval. Orders were changed in the morning and evening, disregarding national credibility and commercial difficulties. There are so many kinds of food, and if pickled meat and ham are to be inspected, then what cannot be inspected? Moreover, inspection must charge a fee. One place makes a start and four places follow suit, fearing that its abuses will be ten times greater than the previous likin. Therefore, in addition to requesting the administrative authorities to maintain the previous approval and fundamentally revoke it based on the facts, our association sends a special letter to you, asking you to take the position of the business community and give sympathy and assistance. We cannot express enough hope, and we respectfully wish you good luck. (The following is omitted)</p>
<p>(Notice to the Whole City) Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya, Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, and Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan yesterday also jointly issued a letter to the parents of children throughout the city (details omitted above). The government's emphasis on treating children well is because children are the vitality of the country and the life of the nation. Today's adults are the children of the past, and today's children will be the adults of the future. Children inherit the careers of adult society, continue to promote and create, maintain and promote the civilization of society. Their responsibilities are both heavy and great. Adults should respect and cherish them. At present, our country is in trouble, and most of the relief depends on adults. However, in order to permanently eliminate foreign aggression and promote national glory, it is necessary to do everything possible to plan for children all over the country, to ensure their survival and development, to strengthen their bodies and enlighten their minds, so as to achieve the permanent effect of internal security and external defense. Our bureau, etc., are aware of this, so we are happy to advocate and commemorate the commendable Children's Day. From now on, the organization for the permanent welfare of children in this city has been planned by our bureau, etc., and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval after being approved by the Preparatory Committee for the celebration of Children's Day. I am afraid that the parents of ordinary children in society are not yet fully aware of this, so this is a special announcement.</p>

<p>The Pickled Meat and Ham Industries</p>
<p>Actively Oppose Inspection</p>
<p>Telegram to the Industry to Advocate Unity</p>
<p>A Letter to Various Business Associations to Ask for Aid</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau is re-implementing the inspection of pickled meat and ham products. Although the fee has been reduced to 30 cents, the Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Association believes that this case has been ordered to be revoked by the Executive Yuan, so how can it be held again? Therefore, it actively opposes it. On the one hand, it urges the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan to request the fundamental revocation according to the previous approval. On the other hand, it sends a telegram to the industry in various places to advocate unity and to various business associations in this city to give sympathy and assistance. The two documents are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Various Places Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Shandong, Rizhao, Nanjing, Yangzhou, Jinhua, Lanxi, Rugao, Taixing, Linpu, Dongyang, Yiwu, Pujiang, Yongkang, Local Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Associations, Greetings. Since the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau last year intended to implement the inspection of pickled meat and ham products, our association, etc., believes that this matter is not necessary to be held. We have stated the reasons and requested the revocation, but we have not been invited to approve it. Therefore, our association had no choice but to send representatives to Beijing to petition. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry approved the order to revoke it in accordance with laws and regulations. Unexpectedly, within just three months of the approval, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice on March 30 that it would implement the inspection from April 1st. There were only two days between the announcement and the date of implementation, and our industry, etc., was not notified in advance. The matter was rushed and surprising. If various places follow suit, one place for one inspection and one place for one fee, then the burden will be ten times greater than the previous likin. For the sake of the future of the industry, in addition to urging the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to uphold justice based on the facts, we are sending a special telegram to you, hoping that your industry will jointly strive for this matter of vital interest to achieve the purpose of revocation. This is very much expected. We respectfully send this telegram and wait for a reply. Shanghai Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Association, respectfully.</p>

<p>Expanding the Education of Merchants in Pudong</p>
<p>Approving the Appropriation of Incense Money from the Emperor-Given Yangdian Temple</p>
<p>To Run Schools with Funds from Superstition</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted to the Municipal Government yesterday, saying: "Submitting a case based on the facts, on March 31, Xia Xinzai, director of the Pudong branch office, reported that Pudong is densely populated, the people are closed-minded, commercial knowledge is naive, and there are many illiterate laborers. The reason is that education has not been popularized. With such a large Pudong, there is only one municipal junior high school, which is limited by funding. The school building is simple and has not yet been built, let alone expanded. Puxi is separated by a river, and schools are lined up, but the expenses are high, which is not affordable for the general small commercial class in Pudong, resulting in more out-of-school youths and more illiterate people. To popularize local education, it is impossible to succeed without allocating the local public funds to supplement the municipal treasury. It is found that the annual incense money income of the Emperor-Given Yangdian Temple in Pudong is about 3,000 yuan. The temple management committee has been established for more than two years, and the accumulated funds are quite considerable. No one knows the bottom line of how they are used. I think this superstitious incense money is one of the local public funds income. If it can be allocated to local education, the public funds will not be wasted, and the local people will benefit. Moreover, the development of education and the revitalization of commerce are closely related. At this time, the world's commercial war is advancing day by day. Looking back at our country, it is as old as ever and as closed-minded as ever. It is urgent to find ways to increase the knowledge of merchants and popularize merchant education, so that we can compete for survival. Otherwise, there is no way to save it. I would like to briefly state my humble opinion and ask your association to forward it to the Municipal Government for approval, so that all the annual incense money income of the Emperor-Given Yangdian Temple can be allocated to local education, so that the future of commerce will be greatly benefited."</p>

<p>Wang Huimin, a native of Zhejiang, is 35 years old. He used to run a photography and film business, but he has been unemployed for more than a year. The day before yesterday (the 31st), Wang suddenly went to the China Hotel on Zhejiang Road alone and opened room 52 to spend the night alone. The night before, he returned to his residence from outside and suddenly swallowed a large amount of opium and waited for death behind closed doors. It was not until 8:00 AM yesterday that the tea servant discovered it and immediately reported it to the police station. The detective rushed to investigate and quickly sent him to the Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because he was deeply poisoned, he died at 4:00 PM. The body was carried to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. A card from a friend who opened a coffin shop at Xinzha Bridge was found in the deceased's Yuan Se Mao Ge cotton-padded jacket. The detective went to check the address and claimed that the deceased was indeed a friend, but there was no deep friendship. Now that he has committed suicide, he can only donate a coffin to show friendship. As for the reason for the suicide, it is thought that it was caused by the torment of the disease and economic difficulties.</p>

<p>Tong Wenming, a local, is 35 years old and used to run a coarse cloth business. The night before, Tong went to room 24 of the Laoxingfa Inn at 36 Mantingfang alone. At that time, he paid the room fee of 42 cents and then closed the door to sleep. At about 11:00 AM yesterday, the tea room routinely called the guest and saw that Tong was lying stiff on the bed with a pale face and unconscious. He immediately reported to the Qianlaozha police station. The detective rushed to investigate and saw that Tong was wearing a fake华达呢棉袍 and a single呢长衫. A bottle of sleeping pill water was found on the small table. It was undoubtedly Tong who had secretly taken suicide. He was immediately sent to the Renji Hospital. It is said that he was deeply poisoned and there was a danger of death.</p>

<p>There are many hospitals in Shanghai, but there is still a lack of specialized treatment places for both mental and physical insanity. In recent years, there have been frequent national disasters and many unemployed people. There are often those who are troubled by circumstances, feel external pressure, and become mentally ill due to worry and anxiety. If they are not treated immediately, they will become disabled if they are mild, and lose their lives if they are severe. Recently, it has been heard that philanthropists Yuan Xilian, Xu Zhimo, Xie Qiangong, Qiao Nianchun, Pan Yulin, Chen Peng, Pan Shiqing, etc., have discussed with Dr. Gu Wenjun, a specialist in the treatment of mental illness, to initiate the establishment of a specialized hospital for mental illness. A preparatory office has been set up in Yuqingli, Fada Road, and work has begun. Famous people in Shanghai, such as Hefei Duan Zhizheng, former Premier Xu Shiying, Si Han Tianshi Zhang Enpu, as well as Li Sihao, Zheng Yuan, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Lianfang, Xu Xinliu, Qi Yueying, Zhao Binghe, and other giants have enthusiastically listed their names to support.

Statistics show that more than 70,000 admission tickets were issued within two weeks. After 8:00 PM last night, the staff of the association, together with the persons in charge of the producing provinces and cities, sorted and packed the exhibits and held a final conclusion, so they were very busy.

<h3 id="e140">Rare Treasures <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Jadeite Trio Shipped to America for Exhibition</p>
<p>Bao Pagoda, Palace Lantern, and Archway Crafted Over a Decade</p>
<p>Hundreds of Jade Artisans' Exquisite Carvings Praised as Divine Skill</p>
<p>Zhang Wendi, a jade merchant from Wu County, spent over a decade and employed hundreds of artisans to carve a jadeite Bao Pagoda, Palace Lantern, and Archway, which have now been completed. Their quality is excellent, and the carving is exquisite, truly a crystallization of Chinese jade carving. They will be shipped to America to be displayed at the Chicago Exposition. Yesterday, Mr. Zhang discussed the carving process as follows: In the spring of the fourth year of the Republic of China, mineralogists Li Benren and Liu Baoju discovered a massive jadeite boulder weighing approximately eight thousand kilograms deep in the jadeite mountains of Burma. Initially, it was difficult to assess its internal quality due to the surrounding sand skin and yellow crust. However, upon dissection, it was found to be of excellent quality, complete, and with few flaws, and a portion was</p>
<h3 id="e141">Covered in Vivid Green <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Truly a rare treasure. Over several years, it was divided into thirteen pieces of various sizes to await a good price. I was immediately astonished by this extraordinary item and spared no expense in selecting the five most outstanding pieces, totaling slightly less than three thousand kilograms. After careful dissection, I obtained 0.4 cubic meters of pure jadeite. The color was vivid, and the texture was delicate and fine. I thought to myself that having obtained such extraordinary material, it must be subjected to extraordinary craftsmanship and carved into exquisite artifacts for the appreciation of the world, so as not to fail this rare and precious material. Only skilled jade artisans can utilize the properties of jadeite, removing its flaws and preserving its beauty, allowing its natural beauty to be fully revealed without any waste. However, this requires not only rich intellect and experience. The selection of art pieces values originality and avoids uniformity and imitation. It must adopt</p>
<h3 id="e142">Artistic Splendor <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>And cultural value to be considered qualified. The Bao Pagoda is a relic that originated from Buddhism and flourished in the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song dynasties. In ancient times, people built pagodas to commemorate parental kindness and express filial piety. Today, people also build pagodas to praise achievements and express admiration. Its solemn and wondrous appearance has long been familiar to the minds of the Chinese people. As for the styles, whether square, round, angular, seven-tiered, or nine-tiered, they all uniquely express the unparalleled ancient Chinese artistic ideas. Furthermore, the Palace Lantern is an item whose system originated in the early Han Dynasty and reached its peak in the Tang Dynasty. Its style is ancient and elegant, rich but not vulgar, and it is sufficient to represent the Chinese people's dignified demeanor and noble nature. Moreover, I thought that the old-style Chinese archways were an immortal commemoration of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness, used to</p>
<h3 id="e143">Maintain Morals and Ethics <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The exquisite structure also sufficiently demonstrates the ancients' heroic, solemn, and respectful thoughts and spirit. However, these three items require materials that are difficult to match and construction that is not easy to fulfill. If made of jade, even the smaller ones, no one has ever dared to attempt it. Fortunately, I obtained this beautiful jadeite material and predicted that the raw materials would be roughly sufficient for these three items. Driven by curiosity, I braved difficulties and engaged in carving. Once the goal was set, I began collecting dozens of drawings and carefully examining them, selecting the most outstanding styles as blueprints. I then made detailed modifications with the guidance of Mr. Wu Baolin, Mr. Ma Gongfu, and Mr. Xu Shaoxian, incorporating my own ideas to create drawings and samples, considering the various possible ranges of polishing, carving, assembly, and disassembly, ensuring ease of placement and storage. On one hand, I exhausted my thoughts and calculated the materials to ensure that the grandeur of the volume would match my ideal. On the other hand, I sought out skilled artisans to</p>
<h3 id="e144">Research Carving Methods <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Hoping to reach the pinnacle and be unparalleled in the world. However, the appearance and content of jade and stone often do not match, and there are often protrusions and deformities. Cutting out regular materials results in a lot of waste. Therefore, jade artisans usually carve objects according to their shape. Now, these three are all regular items that do not allow for the slightest deviation. The archway alone is very difficult, let alone the seven tiers of the Bao Pagoda, which have a fixed proportion in size, and the two covers of the Palace Lantern, which are even more difficult to ensure are pure and flawless. While the larger ones can be made smaller, how can broken ones be rejoined? The great danger is truly frightening, causing hesitation for a long time. Then I thought that to create extraordinary artifacts, one must experience extraordinary difficulties, so I resolutely proceeded with my business and carefully engaged in dissection. Whenever encountering an important connection, my heart would tremble as if hanging a banner. Passing through one difficult hurdle brings one joy. This went on for months and years. Fortunately, thanks to Heaven's blessing, the various materials were mostly prepared,</p>
<h3 id="e145">Without the Slightest Regret <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>It can be said that the height of the Bao Pagoda can reach one meter and twelve centimeters, and the diameter of its roof is slightly more than one-third of a meter. The total height of the Palace Lantern is more than half a meter, and the diameter of its two covers is nearly one-quarter of a meter, completely covered in green without any flaws. The archway is as high as 41% of a meter and nearly half a meter wide. The materials are uniform in color and brilliant in color. Such a fine product has never been seen or heard of in my life. At this time, even the most extravagant writing is not easy to describe it. Li Hanchen from Beiping, the number one jade artisan, respected throughout the country, was sincerely introduced by Mr. Cheng Shixiang and hired with heavy capital to take full responsibility for supervision. I also recruited hundreds of skilled artisans with specialized expertise, giving them generous wages to relieve them of their livelihood concerns, allowing them to concentrate on their work and seek perfection. Therefore, the Bao Pagoda carved by them is uniform and consistent, without the slightest deviation or inclination. The bells on each of its eight corners are carved from the pagoda itself, and the close structure and exquisite construction of its dougong brackets are breathtaking everywhere,</p>
<h3 id="e146">Praised as Divine Skill <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Palace Lantern is not only elegant in style, but also exquisitely carved with figures, each lifelike and beautiful, surpassing ancient works of art. The beauty and perfection of the archway is even more so. When the project was completed, it was placed in the hall and illuminated with electric lights, emitting a great light. I stared attentively and imagined with rapt attention. The successful completion was truly something to be proud of. It can be called the "Trio of Wonders", and I am not exaggerating. Recalling the past, I spared no expense to purchase this natural giant jadeite boulder, nor did I skimp on extravagant wages to gather hundreds of skilled artisans from all over the country, each of whom exhausted their thoughts and talents, working for nearly ten years to achieve perfection and beauty, combining fine jade and skilled artisans to create this unprecedented masterpiece. Overjoyed, I describe the process to art connoisseurs at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Guangdong Youth Exploration Team</p>
<h3 id="e147">Chen Yiqin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Traveled for Years Across Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang Provinces</p>
<p>Plans to Go North to Join Teacher Weng's Work</p>
<p>Chen Yiqin, the leader of the Chinese Youth World Exploration Team, arrived in Shanghai by train from Hangzhou yesterday morning. A reporter from the Riri News interviewed Mr. Chen at his lodging yesterday. He spoke in detail about the organization process, travel situation, and future plans, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Organization Process <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>I grew up in Hong Kong and graduated from an English-language secondary school. I often saw Westerners organizing exploration teams to search for historical sites not witnessed by modern people in various places. This kind of adventurous undertaking is commonplace and unremarkable for people in their countries. However, looking around our country, there are very few organizations of this kind. I have always admired exploration and have been influenced by books such as adventure. Therefore, when the January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War broke out last year, I invited several classmates to go to the rear office of the 19th Route Army, abandoning my studies to join the army. My request was not approved, so I returned to Hong Kong with my companions and organized an exploration team. The purpose was to: (1) Seek out secluded and mysterious places to advocate the dumb mysteries of hundreds of years ago; (2) Investigate local customs and compile them into magazines; (3) Photograph strange activities on the spot and fearlessly gain experience to save China's precarious country. I plan to contribute what I have learned to people all over the world in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Travel Experience <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>In June of last year, I planned to hire four local porters with my younger brother Yike, my sister, and myself, to divide up the luggage and start organizing this team. After leaving our hometown in Zhongshan County, my younger brother Yike was seriously injured when he ventured to photograph the Huangchao Cave waterfall and lost his footing in the rock. He was escorted back to Hong Kong by my sister for treatment, but it was ineffective and he died. My sister also stopped moving forward because she could not stand the mountain mist and miasma. I had no choice but to stop the trip. However, my ambition did not diminish. I re-solicited comrades in Hong Kong: Lin Xiehe, Feng Yaozong, Li Yuanzhu, Zeng Lirong, Song Jinming, Cen Yaman, and others. Eight people set off again in December. When we arrived at Kowloon Mountain, Shatin, and Tai Po, Song and Zeng returned halfway because they could not endure the hardship. After passing through Guangzhou to Huiyang, Feng and Li also quit, leaving only Mr. Lin, Ms. Cen, and myself. When we set off, we had a lot of luggage. At that time, we hired four local porters. Unexpectedly, when we arrived in the Hailufeng area, we encountered bandits. We immediately fought the bandits. Mr. Cen was killed by the bandits first. All the materials we searched for and the accompanying moving cameras, guns, cameras, curtains, clothing, passports, etc. were looted, resulting in a loss of more than 4,000 yuan. Mr. Lin and I were also arrested. We escaped to Shantou penniless. We sought travel expenses and planned to return to Hong Kong to stop moving forward. Later, the Shantou Bureau persuaded us and provided us with a lot of money. After experiencing security, Yunxiao, Zhangpu, Zhangzhou, and Haicheng, we arrived in Xiamen. Because we received too many travel supplies from various agencies and groups along the way, we hired local porters. Fortunately, Huang Zhichang from Xiamen volunteered to take on the task. Therefore, we passed through Tongan, Quanzhou, Huian, Putian, and Fuqing to Fuzhou. After arriving in Fuzhou, Mr. Huang was too tired and was admitted to the hospital for treatment, so we stopped again. When we set off from Fuzhou, a student from Fujian, Huang Changli, joined us. When we arrived in Wenzhou, we could not reach Ningbo and also returned halfway because we could not endure the hardship. Considering the national crisis, I planned to temporarily reorganize. When I arrived in Fuzhou, I had asked General Cai Tingkai, the Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Fujian, to change my passport and go straight to the Northeast to participate in the Anti-Japanese War. Later, I passed through Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo to Hangzhou. After arriving in Hangzhou, Mr. Lin withdrew again. However, I am willing to do my best to move forward and will not temporarily stop because my comrades have retreated. Therefore, I came to Shanghai alone by train from Hangzhou. I stayed for a day or two to ask various agencies and groups to stamp their seals to keep as a souvenir. Then I followed Nanjing to the Northeast.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen is from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He is young, heroic, lively, and able to endure hardship. He continued his second attempt after the first failure. He has overcome many twists and turns along the way. He is truly a rare modern young man. All travel expenses for the exploration team in the past were self-funded and self-prepared. He also signed a contract with the Hong Kong and Guangzhou Weifeng Public Review newspapers to send photos and texts every week. Now, because it cannot be implemented, it is difficult to realize the reward of sending money from the two newspapers once every half month. Before the disaster, the purpose was to seek out secluded and scenic spots and explore ancient sites. Therefore, the places we passed through were mostly remote mountains and rocks, and we had to explore them. The cities we passed through were nothing more than purchasing supplies, receiving mail, and conducting investigations. Now, because the property was looted at one time, the economy is very panic. Therefore, we have to call for help everywhere we arrive. From Shantou to this place, we have relied on the help of local agencies, which is very grateful. Mr. Chen is scheduled to visit Mayor Wu of this city today, and then plans to go to Nanjing and then to Tianjin to join Teacher Weng Zhaoyuan and participate in the Anti-Japanese War.</p>

<p>The funeral of Huang Zhiqing, the former Chief Instructor of the Beiyang Military Academy, was held at the Buddhist Jingye Society yesterday. Relatives and friends from far and near came to pay their respects. At noon, Xu Shiying was the master of ceremonies, and Wang Yiting and Wen Lanting, two elders, inscribed the epitaphs. At 2:00 p.m., various charitable organizations in Shanghai, the United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees, the Xinwei Relief Association, and the Shanghai Temporary Volunteer Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei held public memorial services. The memorial hall was filled with elegiac couplets from famous Party and government figures. Here are a few selected couplets: (Chiang Kai-shek) The soaring is already seen in the prosperity of the He and Fen rivers, and the bleakness is difficult to preserve in the light of the Lu Palace. (Duan Qirui) Friendship and righteousness in two generations, the virtuous father and son in a lifetime, and the divine light of teaching in the past. (Wu Tiecheng) Cleaning up the turbid and clarifying the water is always famous and will last for hundreds of generations. The classics of longitude and latitude still leave behind the love of planting sweet pear trees. (Shan Zhen) Lecturing like Zhong Yan, asking for business, many worthy people are loaded, Xing Tang Zuo, writing a book to inherit the bundle of hair, not meeting in person, leaving it to future generations. (Sun Ke) The years are more than rare in ancient times, and I have long seen the elders in the picture of Luoshe. The name will last for three immortality, why only generals and ministers come out of the He and Fen rivers) (Chen Sanli) The spirit and righteousness are tied to the same group. I am most in love with the Huai Fang flying shang Hai Lou zhu. Gong Ming has not yet completed his ambition, and his empty biography has been passed down. Zuo Si recites history, and Du Mu talks about soldiers.</p>

<p>Cui Yuanchong, a 20-year-old driver from Yangzhou, drove his private car No. 6024, owned by a British man named Mai Ding, through Feilu Road in the French Concession from west to east at 9:15 a.m. the other day. In front of door number 1004, Wang Amiao, an elderly man from Nanhui in his sixties, was crossing the road from the south to the north. Cui's car could not avoid him and knocked him down, injuring his head and causing him to lose consciousness. The police saw him, rushed to record the number, woke Wang, and sent him to Guangci Hospital. Due to his old age and serious injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died that afternoon. The hospital notified the police station, who took the body and car to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. The next day, the Traffic Management Office reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Deng Baosun to conduct an autopsy. After confirming that Wang Amiao had died from a car accident, the court ruled that the body should be collected by Wang Yousheng, the son of the deceased. The defendant was returned to the Traffic Management Office for questioning. The police station will send the defendant to the court for questioning today.</p>

Gao's wife and seven-year-old son were terrified.</p>
<p>Huasheng Road, Zhabei At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out in a row of old buildings near the intersection of Guangfu Road and Huasheng Road, behind the famous Small Chimney Silk Factory, where Ni Dingxing and Xiao Shunxing No. 2 stored broken cloth and paper scraps. The fire quickly spread through the roof, and more than a dozen buildings were destroyed in an instant.

The 4th District Public Security Bureau arrested Xiao Panfu, a suspect who started the fire. He claimed to be a 48-year-old man from Changzhou who ran a used goods business and also stored broken cloth and other items in the house. However, he refused to reveal the cause of the fire. Zhongxing Road At around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Zheng Jiasheng, a 42-year-old man from Shaoxing, opened a yarn dyeing factory at 1378 Zhongxing Road.

After the fire department from various sections drove the belt cars to put out the fire, three thatched sheds had been burned down. Zheng Jiasheng was subsequently arrested by the police and taken to the 4th District Public Security Bureau to await trial.</p>

<p>Qian Minsheng, a 17-year-old apprentice from Changshu in the clothing store opened by Huang Ada at No. 18 Jinjiafang, South of Fangbang Bridge, has been an apprentice in the clothing store for four years. Yesterday, because the guest entrusted him to make a jacket, he was negligent and made the wrong size of the pants. When a dispute arose, his master Huang Ada happened to arrive in Shanghai from his hometown in Changshu and returned to the store, so he reprimanded his apprentice Qian Minsheng a few words. Unexpectedly, the apprentice was usually very depressed, so he was resentful and tired of the world. At about 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning, he hanged himself in the back of the store. Gu Han'gen, who lived with him, noticed it, but it was too late to save him. The store owner Huang Ada reported it to the 1st Section of the 2nd District, and the detective Zhu Songqing was sent to investigate everything. The local bail was reported for an autopsy. In the afternoon, the court sent a prosecutor to conduct an autopsy, and then ordered the store owner to prepare a coffin and collect the body, and ordered the store owner to wait for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e166">A Third Discussion on the Power of Supply and Western Civilization <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. Xu Xianfu of this city's letter丨</p>
<p>Answer: Your repeated letters "all have the masses of the nation in mind. All discussions, self-assessment, suicides, love, careers, inheritance and other issues are truly superior." Indeed, indeed! Therefore, our reply to you is tirelessly detailed, but due to the limited space of this column, we have not been able to exhaust all points, causing you to repeatedly explain. However, the more a principle is debated, the clearer it becomes, and the more an issue is analyzed, the more refined it becomes. We welcome your eloquent debate. However, looking at the recent two letters, there are too many things that should be discussed. Here are a few key points to discuss with you again.</p>
<p>(1) The previous letter said "This was a momentary feeling,"</p>
<p>And the letter of March 14th said, "The feeling in my first letter was a kind of strong 'expression' that arose after the accumulation of past 'feelings.'" Since this feeling was accumulated, it is not a "momentary feeling." Isn't this a bit contradictory? Feelings first, research later. This kind of fact may exist, but it is limited to simple and easily felt things. If your long discourse lists some statistics and cites many historical facts, this is not a simple feeling, but rather a "concept of national survival and national rise and fall" that can only be formed after considerable research. We are not ignoring feelings, but we feel that your statement is self-contradictory and does not escape the exaggeration of old scholars in China. You clearly wrote something with thought, but you insist on saying that it was written casually; you clearly researched it (at least to a considerable extent), but you insist on saying ... ... "We think this attitude is unacceptable, so we tell you this. As for your citing of classics, most of them are irrelevant. Fichte's Addresses to the German Nation were expressed with fervent emotions due to the defeat in the Battle of Jena, but they were not, as you said, a 'momentary feeling.' Fichte was a great philosopher of the time, rising after Kant. He must have thoroughly studied the ways of national rise and fall and national survival in peacetime, and then published his extremely valuable historical documents at the appropriate time. However, you use them as a defense for a 'momentary feeling' and writing things down haphazardly ... ... "This is wrong!</p>
<p>(2) Your first letter said: "Western civilization ... ... one is the power of supply, the other is the power of control." The second letter also said: "The division between capitalism and socialism lies only in the power of control." You also said: "The difference between capitalism and socialism lies only in the power to guide human evolution." In fact, the difference between socialism and capitalism lies not only in the power of control, but also in the power of supply. According to your explanation of "the power of supply": "The so-called power of supply is the invention of people's knowledge and skills, the control of nature, and the production of raw materials for human evolution ... ... ... ... "Simply put, it is controlling nature. That's right, controlling nature is necessary in capitalist society and in socialist society, but there is a quantitative difference between controlling nature in capitalist society and controlling nature in socialist society. Because capitalism cannot fully utilize science, materials, and the intelligence and talents of the majority of people, the power of socialism to control nature surpasses the power of capitalism to control nature, that is, it further develops the "power of supply." The difference in quantity develops to a certain extent, and then it becomes a qualitative difference. Therefore, after socialism is completed, humanity's only task is to conquer nature, that is, to control nature. Therefore, when we study the difference between capitalism and socialism, and forget the greatness of socialism's control of natural forces, that is, we forget a difference between it and capitalism, the result is that we will inevitably lose half of its true content. Otherwise, capitalist society certainly wants to control nature. Even in feudal society, wouldn't people want to control nature? A ship, an airplane, certainly controls nature. Isn't a wooden boat, a mule cart, also controlling nature? The only difference is that due to the difference in quantity, it reaches a certain degree and then becomes a qualitative difference, thus becoming a difference between capitalism and feudal economy. By analogy, this is true everywhere. You only see the power of capitalism to control nature, but you have no time to carefully study its dialectical changes, and thus ignore its great role in the difference between socialism and capitalism. Lenin once said that socialism is the dictatorship of the proletariat plus electrification, which has profound meaning. Of course, capitalist society also utilizes electricity, but socialism must utilize it to the greatest extent, from quantitative change to qualitative change. This is why it is different.</p>
<p>(4) We are not fundamentally opposed to youth, but we want to ask what kind of youth? Looking at your statement "public opinion advocates, youth leads, and the masses of laborers practice it, and then the revolution can be observed and accomplished," setting youth apart from the masses of laborers, the meaning is as if only people who have received higher education now can lead the revolution, and the masses of laborers are only obeying orders. This is completely unacceptable. The cultural level of the revolutionary masses cannot be proportional to the education of schools.</p>
<p>(5) The capitalism and socialism we are talking about refer to economic organizations and social organizations. Therefore, we can say that the economy of capitalism and the economy of socialism, or the society of capitalism and the society of socialism, or the country of capitalism and the country of socialism. The socialism we are talking about is a product of modern capitalist society, not Plato's Republic. They are a world apart, with no similarities at all. They must not be confused. There are only two futures for current society, one is capitalist society and the other is socialist society. There is no third road. However, you forcibly combine "social policies, fascism, and ideal reohnocracy, etc." and list them together. Social policy is a kind of social reformist policy adopted in capitalist countries. However, its political environment and economic organization are still capitalist. For example, Bismarck stole one or two points from the demands of the labor movement in the socialist theories of the time and changed them beyond recognition. This is his social policy. As for fascism, it is only a last struggle when capitalism reaches its end. Its society is still capitalist, because it further intensifies the oppression of the laboring masses. They cannot but compete for the market; they cannot but compete for colonies and divide the colonies. Mussolini's Italy is like this, and Hitler's Germany is also like this.</p>
<p>(6) You said that "Marx's materialist conception of history believes that capitalism will evolve to a period of natural collapse, the power of the proletariat will increase, and communist socialism will be realized." I am very ignorant of such a fresh Marx's materialist conception of history, and I have never read such a Marx's theory. I remember that Liang Qichao seemed to have such a view. After the end of the war, when he returned to China from Europe, he criticized the materialist conception of history, saying that since the materialist conception of history says that capitalism will inevitably collapse after it develops to a certain period, then we should just wait for it to collapse. Why do we still need to have a revolution? In fact, this is laziness, fatalism, not Marxism, not the materialist conception of history. Capitalist society does not "naturally collapse." It must be destroyed by human power before it can be both sent to its end and give birth to new life. Even more strangely, you said that "Lenin's Soviet Russia is no longer the communist society that Marx idealized." This is really wrong. Lenin's Soviet Russia is not a communist society. Where did you see Lenin say that Soviet Russia is a communist society? Your mistake lies in: 1. Not knowing the difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and communist society: 2. Not knowing the society that Marx idealized as a communist society and the transitional social form (the stage of the dictatorship of the proletariat) that he used to achieve this society. Now try to tell me: What kind of society is the communist society that Marx idealized? How does he teach us to achieve this society? What kind of society is Lenin's Soviet Russia?</p>
<p>(7) The so-called national self-determination is the right of each nation to decide whether to join a certain national federation or withdraw from a certain country, and it does not mean that each nation has the right to decide on federal politics within a federation. You did not distinguish this point, so it is appropriate to mistakenly regard the constitutional provisions of federal administration as interfering with national self-determination. This is really deliberately nitpicking. To be honest, we study theory, recognize the facts, and we can go anywhere, do anything. However, when we criticize the Soviet Union, we should also reflect on ourselves. The various ethnic groups under the Soviet Republic are the true epitome of "national self-determination" in the world. You can understand this by reading Dewey's recollections after visiting the Soviet Union. Finally, I would also like to offer a word of advice. You are really a good student in Chinese universities now, at least in Shanghai universities. You have read some books, but they are disorganized, and your thoughts are confused as a result. It is best to read a few theoretical books first and clarify your thinking methods, so that you will not say one thing from the east and another from the west. However, I must repeat, you are indeed a good student in the university now!</p>

<p>Shangwen Elementary School expands ▲ First Shishi Elementary School to be abolished</p>
<p>The Shangwen Elementary School on Shangwen Road in Nanshi has seen considerable development in its school affairs in recent years. The original school buildings were insufficient, and the Municipal Education Bureau approved the allocation of the former County Education Bureau site and the First Public School campus to the school for the reconstruction of new school buildings. However, the First Experimental Elementary School still has students on campus, but their number is less than that of Shangwen. For the convenience of school management and development, the Municipal Education Bureau has decided to merge the First Shishi Elementary School into Shangwen Elementary School starting next semester.</p>

<p>Chinese Athletes Suffer a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Russian Emigrant Sports Association Wins the Championship</p>
<p>French Army Second, Lancashire Third</p>
<p>Individual First Place to Englishman Grant</p>
<p>Time: 31 minutes, 47 seconds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Open Six-Mile Cross-Country Run was held yesterday at 11:00 AM in Hongkou Park. With twelve teams from China, Britain, Russia, and France participating, it had an international competitive nature, attracting a large audience. Coupled with the pleasant weather and beautiful scenery, Hongkou Park was packed. However, the result of the competition was disappointing. The three Chinese teams were completely defeated, and even the highly anticipated Bai Hong team finished only fifth. At the four-mile mark, Bai Hong's Wang Yalun and Dong Jiashe were in the lead, but they went the wrong way and had to double back, which greatly affected them. It was a pity for them. The Russian Emigrant Sports Association won the championship with 31 points. The French Army was second with 32 points, and the British Lancashire was third with 41 points. The individual championship was won by Lancashire's Grant with a time of 31 minutes and 47 seconds, about fifteen meters ahead of second-place Amany of the French team.</p>
<p>Bai Hong's Crushing Defeat</p>
<h3 id="e180">Starting Forward <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>At exactly 11:00 AM, the eighty athletes stood together at the west end of Hongkou Park, along the gate of the East Sports Association. As the pistol was fired, over one hundred and sixty swift feet raced west towards the Sports Association, turning onto East Sports Road and into the fields of Jiangwan. The Bai Hong generals were all in the lead. Wang Zhenglin and others, including Huang Shengbai, were slightly unwell midway, but still bravely pushed forward.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Mid-Course Situation <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>After crossing the fields, they turned east again, rejoining East Sports Road near Shuidaian Road, about four miles from the starting point and about two miles from the finish line. At that time, the leading person was Wang Zhenglin of Bai Hong, with the Russian Lifcuntsuv closely following three feet behind, and Dong Jiashe, also of Bai Hong, in third place.</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Major Mistake <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>At this crucial moment to determine the outcome, a huge mistake was discovered. Five or six people, including Wang and Dong, had taken the wrong route. After rejoining Sports Association Road, they should not have gone straight but should have turned again onto East Sports Association Road. Wang and others had to double back, covering thirty or forty meters unnecessarily. Grant, who was originally in seventh place, jumped to first place.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Impossible to Recover <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhenglin, Dong Jiashe, and the Russian Lifcuntsuv bravely chased after them. Lifcuntsuv still had energy to spare and gradually caught up with them, but Wang and Dong were limited by their strength and could not recover. When they reached the finish line, Lancashire's Grant of the British Army was fifteen meters ahead of the Frenchman Amany to take first place with a time of 31 minutes and 47 seconds. Kirat was only a hair's breadth behind Amany in third. Dong Jiashe was eighteenth, Huang Shengbai nineteenth, and Wang Zhenglin twenty-third. The first Chinese to arrive was Chen Xuzhou in fourteenth place.</p>

<p>Southern China and Hong Kong Cannot Participate Due to Schedule Conflicts</p>
<p>Only Eastern China and Central China Participating Does Not Meet the Definition of Zonal Tournament</p>
<p>National Sports Federation Plans to Change to Friendship or Exhibition Match</p>
<p>Since the National Zonal Football Tournament was rescheduled by the organizing body, the Hubei Provincial Department of Education, the Southern China Zone first announced that it could not participate due to a schedule conflict. The Hong Kong team also telegraphed the National Sports Federation yesterday for the same reason, temporarily suspending its participation. In the current situation, only the East China and Central China Zones (the West China Zone has not yet given a definite answer after the postponement) have confirmed their participation. The number of units is too small and does not seem to meet the definition of a national zonal competition. It is rumored that the National Sports Federation may change the competition to a friendship or exhibition nature.</p>
<p>Excellent Performance, Both sides performed many excellent moves. Jinan's five forwards were exceptionally lively and brave. [unclear] Zhan Gu Shang [unclear] is a talented defender and performed well as a forward. Midfielders Liang Shutang and Chen Zhenxiang were good at controlling the game and were impeccable. Unfortunately, [unclear] Feng [unclear] was small and suffered losses. [unclear]'s side was as stable as Mount Tai. Jiang Shan Jing was injured shortly after entering the field and later switched to forward, with Gu moved back to defense. The team's meticulous work was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Early Game Situation, The opening clash was spirited and energetic. Jinan's forwards steadily approached the Western Police goal, creating several dangerous situations. However, their inaccurate shooting resulted in wasted effort. The Western Police were not to be outdone, with their five forwards being tall and strong, and extraordinarily brave. They charged left and right, repeatedly attacking Jinan's borders. Fortunately, Jinan was well-prepared and defended their territory. However, at thirty minutes, Meng Zhangfei Jiang Shan Jing was injured when he bravely defended against the enemy, and his leg was crushed by Diffe and Pike. The first half ended with no score.</p>
<p>Second Half Loss, When the second half began, Jinan's offensive strength was reduced after Gu Shangrang returned to the defense and Jiang Shan Jing filled the forward position. In addition, the opponent's goalkeeper, Platlai, was stable and impeccable. At twenty-five minutes, Jinan was penalized for a free kick twenty yards from the goal. The Western Police's Zha Xu kicked it, and Xu Heng saved it, but the referee suddenly announced a re-kick. Zha Xu kicked it into the net, and Jinan conceded a goal. The crowd expressed their dissatisfaction with the referee. Later, Jinan also received a similar free kick, but Lao Jiang's kick missed. The game ended, and Jinan lost by a score of 0-1.</p>
<p>League Ends, The Western Union Football League, which opened on Double Ten Day last year and has been running for nearly five months, has now ended all its competitions. Tung Wah won the Class A championship. The final results are as follows:</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>In this day and age, southerners who were unwilling to serve the puppet government have successively returned home. One returning guest from Zhadong, amidst sighs, spoke of the corrupt officials in the Northeast before its fall who lacked common sense and were unaware of the global situation.</p>
<p>The officials in the Northeast only cared about flattering foreign powers and exploiting the people. They lacked all other common knowledge. There was a high-ranking official who could be considered relatively clear-headed among the Northeast officials. He familiarized himself with the drafts prepared by his secretary and could eloquently deliver speeches from the podium. One day, at a celebratory commemoration, many consular officials from foreign countries came to observe. He was again about to take the stage and show off his signature deceptive act. He did not use a draft prepared by his secretary, because he had recently read a booklet that he considered an excellent source of information for his speech. Thus, he boldly lectured on the global situation.</p>
<p>He was afraid that the foreign guests would not understand his wonderful arguments and that he would not be able to fully display his talents, so he ordered the interpreter to simultaneously translate his words into Western languages on the stage for the appreciation of blue-eyed people. He had a wonderful argument: "World civilization is advancing by leaps and bounds. In the past, aerial warfare required huge amounts of bombs to bombard enemy positions. Now, new British aircraft only need to pour some sleeping potion from a small glass bottle onto the enemy's territory to put all soldiers within ten miles to sleep for forty-eight hours, depriving them of combat power and leaving them to be captured."</p>
<p>After he left the stage, the British consul was the first to ask him: "I have never heard that your country has an aircraft with this sleeping potion. Where did your statement come from?" He said: "This is written in the booklet. There is a book to prove it." The British consul simply smiled. Later, he told his secretary about this matter. The secretary asked him what booklet he was referring to. He said: "The Air Force of the 21st Century." The secretary laughed and said: "This is an idealized novel predicting the air force a century from now. How can it be used as proof?" He widened his eyes and said: "Isn't it the 21st century now?" The secretary said: "It is currently the 20th century. At least sixty or seventy years must pass before it is the 21st century."</p>
<p>The high-ranking official's purple face turned red, and he tightly closed his mouth, adorned with a German-style mustache, and remained silent for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Seizing the World <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>The phrase "Seizing the World" has been passed down from father to son, from son to grandson, and even to the great-grandchildren in our Suzhou region, for countless generations. Therefore, I believe that in everything, only "fighting" can seize the world, and only "fighting" can lead to a way out. I remember that in my neighbor's house, there was a daughter who was simultaneously having affairs with two young men. One day, the two young men happened to meet. Each rolled up his sleeves, and without a word, they fought each other to the death with fists and feet. After a chaotic fight, one was sweating and panting, while the other was bleeding from the head. It was clear that the sweating and panting friend had won. The friend who was bleeding from the head, fearing a second beating, had to give up his lover. Thus, the victorious friend single-handedly possessed the girl without any scruples. This is what is called "Seizing the World."</p>
<p>Let me give another example. Suppose a wife and concubine are fighting over a husband. The wife does not allow the husband to spend the night in the concubine's room, and the concubine also wants to possess the husband exclusively. At first, they only exchange cold words. Later, they gradually escalate to the point where one scolds the other for being a shameless wife, and the other scolds the other for being a rotten prostitute. If this still cannot be resolved, they have to resort to the final measure: a comparison of who can make a bigger mess. If the result is that the refined wife is beaten by the rough concubine, who smashes the furniture in the room, pulls out a lock of hair, and bites off a piece of flesh from her arm, then the wife can only watch as the husband is taken over by the concubine and enjoys it all alone. Apart from pounding the pillow five thousand times, there is nothing else she can do. Because the concubine has ultimately "Seized the World." In this world, no matter what environment you are in, if you want to stand your ground and not be taken advantage of, you must have the mindset of "Seizing the World." Just sitting at home sighing at the sky and stamping your feet at the ground is just like a saying in Suzhou dialect: "Do Tou," because the "world" is "seized" by oneself through "fighting."</p>

<p>For Youthful Young Men</p>
<p>When you want to kiss her, you must ask for her consent, and I believe she will definitely refuse. It is best if you know that she will not refuse, and you can first test her intentions before making a move. Then, her eyes will tell you that she is willing to accept!</p>
<p>To make her love you, your actions should be lively, but not too slippery, because this will make her not only not love you but also fear you.</p>
<p>Observing whether a woman has a lover is very important in the process of courtship. Here, I will tell you a secret: if you see her looking straight ahead, that is a sign that she does not have a lover; if she looks up, not only does she have one, but she is also very satisfied; if she looks down, she has some interest in you, no, at least she is waiting for you to love her.</p>
<p>If you are afraid of divorce, please do not get married.</p>
<p>If she is older than you, you must not call her "dear sister." You should be tactful and call her "dear younger sister."</p>
<p>Telling her that a beautiful female neighbor has moved away will often make her very happy.</p>
<p>Do not believe her, even though she is very solemn on the surface and often scolds that there are no good men in the world, but in her heart, she hopes that someone will come to pursue her. When she tells you about singleism, she is telling you: this is the time to attack her!</p>
<p>If she scolds you, you should be happy, because this is her expression of love for you!</p>
<p>If you fall in love with her, you should not let her know that you are in love with her, if possible, because after she knows, she often reveals arrogance out of complacency.</p>
<p>The "aspirin" in your pocket should always be prepared. If you go out with her and you are short of Yuan Shikai [silver dollars], take out the pills when you have no other choice and say to her: "Oh! I have a terrible headache! I need to go home!" This will definitely work.</p>

<p>— Confucian Monk</p>
<p>That the great Chinese nation, with its thousands of years of cultural history, still has so many useless fools to this day is truly a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Those who don't go to the cinema, don't enter dance halls, and bury themselves in study rooms are called literary fools, or "bookworms."</p>
<p>When "bookworms" cast aside their books and enter society, they don't know how to "boast" or "flatter," so naturally they won't "get promoted" or "get rich." If they don't seek office or wealth, then they are "idiots."</p>
<p>If these "idiots" don't commit suicide but instead want to write honest complaints with a worn-out brush, they will still run into the barrel of a gun, either being thrown into prison or sent to the underworld. And then people will give them a new name, calling them self-inflicted "Ah Sens."</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Passionate telegrams often contain tragic phrases like "Even if one soldier remains, we must resist to the end." But in reality, at most, even that one soldier is finished, while those who send the telegrams are still alive and become "national heroes." Those who die, who truly use their bodies as shields against bullets, are invariably fools.</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Those who don't retreat to "preserve strength" but insist on fighting the enemy head-on, never realizing the truth until they die, are fools.</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Those who can support themselves and even feed many clever people who exploit others for their own benefit, but who, because they wear tattered cloth clothes and go to the city, are treated like "locust mothers," everywhere being called foolish "country bumpkins."</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>China's national fortune seems to have been a bit unlucky in recent years. So, is it because there are too many or too few fools?</p>

<p>Chapter Three: Ultimately Failing to Untie the Knot, Entering the Door Casting a Mistake, Secretly Pitying the Maid's Wishes to Push Food to Share</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang said, "I just came back from the city and saw a large pot of beef being carried out of the halal restaurant. It looked very fresh, and I thought I'd buy two catties for you to taste. It's definitely better than the camel meat they use to fill orders outside the city." As he spoke, he lifted it high in front of Zhao Weng and said with a smile, "Look, isn't this fresh? How would you like to eat it? I'll get the seasonings." "It's going to snow. How about slicing it thin and having a hot pot?" Zhao Weng smiled and said, "We don't have that kind of equipment at home. Eating it that way would be a little forced and less fun. Besides, I'm afraid I won't be able to digest it." Zhao Ziqiang said, "That's true. I'll buy two big radishes and braise the beef with them." Zhao Weng stroked his beard and nodded with a smile. So Zhao Ziqiang went to the kitchen himself to cut the beef and told the errand boy, Xiao Lin, to buy radishes. Xiao Lin went to the front yard, and he chased after him from behind, calling out, "Xiao Lin, be careful when you buy radishes. Don't buy ones that are frozen inside. The old master won't eat them." Jiang heard this in the house and said to Guizhi, "Company Commander Zhao is really good to his old father. He thinks of everything. If I had a son who could support me, I wouldn't want him to be a company commander or anything. As long as he had a heart like Company Commander Zhao, I would die content." Guizhi said, "In this day and age, men and women are equal. Sons can support their parents, and daughters can do the same. Do you believe me? I'm determined to support you for the rest of your life." Jiang sighed and said, "It's not enough just to have that heart. When you go to someone else's home, they will still make half the decisions." Guizhi replied, "What do you mean, someone else making half the decisions? Listen, I'm going to support you for the rest of your life. I'll stay with you and definitely... definitely... never marry into the Yang family." Jiang said, "Why?" Guizhi said, "Didn't I say? It's to support you!" Zhao Ziqiang stood by the gate of the courtyard, listening to these words, and couldn't help but nod. Then he returned to the kitchen to cut the beef. After preparing the dishes properly, he went to Zhao Weng's room to chat with his father. Zhao Weng said, "Xiao Lin hasn't made the radish and beef yet! You're busy all day at the camp. When you come back, you should rest properly." (31)</p>

<p>— Silver Maple</p>
<p>When men whom you don't know well or haven't been formally introduced to approach you for acquaintance and dates, don't consider it a fortunate thing, because they are only using you for pleasure. If you earnestly associate with them, they will consider you a very foolish and careless woman and won't respect you. If they really want to marry you, that's only if you're the only woman in the world.</p>
<p>A happy union is when both husband and wife acknowledge the existence of their differences, and they only know how to cooperate and help each other, without intending to eliminate those differences. This is the most proper way, because husband and wife are originally meant to complement each other and become one. What destroys the happiness of a couple and breaks the bond of a family is not just important issues like economics, which is very unfortunate. Often, very small issues greatly affect the peace and tranquility of married life. Men or women who are too serious or too talkative can damage family happiness.</p>
<p>New-era women are neither parasites nor dependents. Even if she becomes a wife and mother, she still continues her career. If her husband's income isn't enough for household expenses, she earns money to supplement it. If she marries a wealthy man, she still refuses to depend on him for a living, not seeking self-sufficiency and becoming an insignificant idle woman. She wants to be a self-reliant, complete person, not a parasitic wife.</p>
<p>The old-style family is dead, that much is certain, but this is only because the renovation of the environment and the progress of science have produced a new and better family to replace the old style. What we are witnessing is not the destruction of the family, but the evolution of the family. However, women have obtained a good opportunity to develop their abilities, which can promote its evolution. The mission that women bear for humanity is none more noble, sacred, or important than building a happy and fulfilling family. Because fully perfect family construction must have educated and capable women to achieve it.</p>
<p>A certain writer said, "Women waste so much time dealing with those decorations and furniture that are both useless and unattractive; they could save this wasted time and use it to train their bodies, cultivate their knowledge, and refine their spirits." New-era women absolutely do not waste their energy on precious decorations and useless furniture. She has a great purpose in life and is very capable of being active in public affairs, and the spirit of prosperity is also more evident in her family. The more knowledgeable, educated, and experienced a wife and mother is, the more successful she will be in creating a family.</p>
<p>If you constantly blame your husband, he will naturally become resentful. If a husband treats his wife this way, the same result will occur. There was a woman of outstanding will who married a man who easily made small mistakes. Because she loved her husband, she urged him every day after they got married. At first, she looked for his mistakes; told him what he should and shouldn't do; and criticized his behavior and words everywhere. This man respected his wife and always tried to make her happy. At first, he always accepted her will and did as she said, but later he couldn't stand it anymore. His good character was ruined by her, and he became an easily angered, depressed, and unhappy person. As a result, both of their lives were miserable. He was not only not influenced by her, but also resented her meddling. His love for his wife was completely extinguished.</p>

<h3 id="e196">On Compromise <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>John Morley's theory of compromise is actually a lash at the contemporaries' lack of compromise, while China's lack of compromise with Japan is actually the most thorough compromise. One concession, then another, then a third, and then the three northeastern provinces, then Rehe, and then... if this isn't compromise, what is it? Having seen the contradiction between name and reality at home and abroad, I want to say a few words about compromise. Zhuangzi said, "Name is the guest of reality." How great are these words! The excellent roots of the Chinese people lie in this.</p>
<p>To speak of the origin of compromise, it is because of this and that, vaguely and ambiguously, that individuals can profit from it. A certain ruler became an emperor through compromise, a certain general gained territory through compromise, and a certain gentleman consolidated his own power and position through compromise, borrowing the power of others to achieve his own desires. What does the country matter to me? What do the people matter to me? If this isn't the function of compromise, then what is it?</p>
<p>In China, not only are people the most fond of compromise, but even the upright and selfless deities are generally fond of compromise. In the village operas I saw as a child in the Hundred Longevity Picture, that short-lived ghost could actually add to his lifespan through the power of a single meal and drink. When people die, they only need to burn more paper money at the City God Temple, and the ghosts will also reduce the severe punishments they inflict on the dead because they are greedy for bribes. Therefore, Chinese dignitaries who do much evil often go to repair temples and offer incense, while foreign tycoons who squeeze the poor are often charitable and benevolent. Charity prevails, sins are eliminated, and the common people become more and more miserable. This is another reflection of the Chinese heaven and deities' love of compromise.</p>
<p>These are originally compromises among the big shots and gentlemen, but among us common people, it is not so. The poor and the poor often quarrel, fight, and lose their lives over a penny. The residents of poor and remote areas love to litigate and often engage in armed fights over trivial matters. Leaving that aside for the moment, just taking Shanghai's streets as an example, day and night, among the common people, occasional open and secret struggles, scolding, and killings are caused by an unrelated word or action. It's truly unknown how many tens or hundreds of incidents there are, and in the end, it benefits the officers in the police station, making their business flourish and their wealth abound. This is also the harm of not compromising.</p>
<p>In this case, the conclusion of my short article is naturally "From this perspective, can one not compromise?"</p>
<p>Primary School Teacher H. Barbusse, translated by Li Qingya. The weather is very hot. We hear the bees flying and see them swarming in the fiery air. Pedestrians carefully dodge into the shadows at the foot of the row of gray houses. This is the scene on the square of the village of Gavadar in the province of Santander, Spain. This village is similar to most villages in Spain, and also similar to the villages in the area where Spain and France border. In the past, the scenery in this place was certainly more picturesque than it is now, but it is not weak now, and the mysterious and dry flavor of Spain, with its towering peaks and worried people, is shrouding this area.</p>
<p>In addition to the buzzing of the bees, there is another large array of murmurs with a monotonous rhythm that is窜到outside from that row of walls. This is the village's elementary school. The interior of the elementary school is similar to the interior of elementary schools all over the world. The walls are dark and solemn; perhaps the hard shell of the elementary school must be changed to the hard shell of society before anyone will change it; many rows of black desks, many small heads, which are also black, but round and square; in the middle, a standing person is clearly a great man, this is the teacher in the elementary school.</p>
<p>He, too, like those fellow workers all over the world, unfolds his extraordinary ingenuity and patience to guide and focus the attention of those thirty small heads, and tries to put as much of the grand view of the real world into those heads as possible.</p>
<p>The village elementary school teacher in Gavada is named Bartolomeo and his last name is Zori. He is a peaceful, simple and kind person, and everyone says that he serves wholeheartedly. In the small scope of this village, his uncompromising attitude has long been recognized by all. If he is occasionally late, the public will say with a firm tone: This is because the clock is out of order.</p>
<p>Because he maintains an upright attitude in his thinking, just as he does in his life, his thoughts cannot satisfy everyone, especially his thoughts that contain the meaning of joint responsibility and cooperation, and some people even say: This is a red party. However, even those who are surprised in their hearts, in their servile and pitiful hearts, that a person can be a red party and be upright at the same time, cannot help but admire Zori.</p>
<p>However, the two important people in Gavada, the two people wearing black robes, the pastor and vice-pastor of the village church, did not think this way. They equally hated this elementary school teacher, even though they could not condemn him except for his intense love of freedom and public happiness.</p>
<p>These two priests monitor this elementary school, which is the factory that manufactures the thinking of the next generation that will follow. Therefore, if they do not want to let the future world escape from their grasp, they should naturally seize this factory in their own hands.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, there was a person named Francisco Ferrer who wanted to liberate all of the elementary schools in Spain from the cold and dark world of the priests. As a result, he was shot by the Spanish government. At that time, those bullets shattered his body before he could finish saying the last sentence that he regarded as the highest slogan of his life, "Long live the elementary school." (To be continued)</p>

If you kick or hit them, not only will they not get angry, but they will also wag their tails incessantly. Horses symbolize loyalty. The horse owner gives them some straw stalks to eat. If you whip them on their backs, they will run as fast as they can, carrying their owner. As for bees symbolizing obedience and ants symbolizing unity, everyone knows that. Therefore, ancient emperors and great Confucian ministers who promoted benevolent rule loved to use these animal ethics, adding explanations of loyalty, filial piety, chastity, righteousness, the three bonds, and the five constants, to show the model and inspire people. To put it plainly, it means that to be a human, you must learn from animals. Only by learning to be like animals can you be considered a human. In this century, we can find "people" who are as righteous as dogs, as loyal as horses, as obedient as bees, and as united as ants everywhere without using telescopes or microscopes, which is the ideal of great Confucian ministers who promote benevolent rule. We cannot help but sing the efforts of ancient sages and praise the fact that people in this century are like animals, creating the culture of this century.</p>
<p>From the above theory of animals symbolizing humans, then humans, without a doubt, can also symbolize animals. If this implication is not contrary to logic, then humans are animals, and animals are humans, becoming a human-animal unity. However, humans are, after all, humans, and animals are, after all, animals, because humans ultimately have an extra set of clothing.</p>
<h3 id="e198">"Midnight" and National Goods Year (Continued) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Le'ai</p>
<p>The war of the masses, although it has not yet defeated those kings of national goods with stock, has already surged up like a tide. Especially during the period described by "Midnight," there was a wave of Xun surge, and then it temporarily receded a bit. This wave is constantly agitating, pushing from here to there. Even if there are some ups and downs, the prospect of breaking through everything is obvious. Those "dogs" use all means to suppress this wave; pretending to be a Gidde-style "national goods struggle" is just one of these means.</p>
<p>Whether it's Wu Sunfu, Lao Zhao, or Zhou Zhongwei, these various kings, whether in the city or in the countryside, are all carefully guarding against it. Landlords like Feng Yunqing cannot but hide in Shanghai to invest in public bonds, and even sell their own daughters, watching their mistresses mess around without rhyme or reason. And although Shanghai is relatively stable, it is also constantly闹ing with labor strikes every day, and the kings of national goods do not have a moment of peace in their dreams, often dreaming of workers overturning their "thrones." This is certainly not an ideal paradise for them, who devour each other. They, even the "industrialists" who do not linger on the old rural life, must "seriously negotiate with the battalion commander and ask him to pay attention to the communists in the surrounding villages;" they also want to deal with the workers by intrigue and want to "wipe out those bad guys in one fell swoop." Are they "surrounded by landmines? Stepping on one will set off an explosion!"... Their "authority has already revealed signs of defeat everywhere, becoming a total collapse!"... The steel wire cushion under them suddenly turned into a mountain of knives. Yes, their future is decline and destruction, although the total collapse is not yet at hand, and although the tip of the knife on the mountain of knives has not yet cut through their throats. Surrounding them, there is indeed Tu Weiyue, who has some small military strategist means, who can use some deceptive and provocative traps, but he can only always "dispatch an additional police force to protect the factory." And what other talents are there besides Tu Weiyue? Empty-talking university professors, interest-eating noble poets? Swords and iron fists? Even Wu Sunfu himself, who thought he was steel, gradually exposed his "outward strength but inward weakness," an indescribable feeling of cowardice, pessimism, decadence, and decline.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of those intellectual youths who participated in the May Thirtieth Movement five years ago can now only "sit high on the second floor of the Dasanyuan Restaurant, hoping to follow the elegant interest of Emperor Nero (Nero) climbing high to watch the city of Rome."</p>
<p>All of this almost reflects the entire Chinese society, but with large cities as the center. This is a "fragment" from the middle of 1930, and it quite implicitly suggests the connection between the past and the future. This is China's first successful realistic novel, with a very obvious influence from Zola (Zola's "Largent" - "Money"). Of course, it has many shortcomings, even errors. However, applying real social science to express the social class relations of China in literature and art cannot be said to be a great achievement for "Midnight." Mao Dun is not Zola, and he at least no longer has Zola's stupid Proudhonism.</p>
<p>Here, it is not possible to study "Midnight" in detail, analyzing it. What I want to point out is just a major event in the Chinese literary world! The appearance of "Midnight" coincided very humorously with the so-called National Goods Year. In the future history of literature in 1933, there is no doubt that the publication of "Midnight" will be recorded; but this "National Goods Year" of 1933 will probably be of no other use than to serve as a humorous contrast to "Midnight"! Originally, this is "Midnight." Before the red sun of the morning shines all over China, how can there be a real National Goods Year? And by that time, this country will no longer be the country of the "kings," nor will it be the country of their backstage bosses.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Haiquan hesitated for a moment and did not answer. Li Yixiang only thought that Haiquan did not believe that he had such great supernatural powers to communicate with the headquarters figures of the S Society. In fact, this was a mistake in Yixiang's observation. Haiquan thought, what is the big deal about being able to know the figures of the S Society headquarters? Yixiang's words were not only unrelated to the revolution, but also illogical. For a young man, even if this is not feudal thought, it can at least be said to be the thought of hero worship, and both of these thoughts are enemies of the revolution.</p>
<p>"...Because that Xuan, Xuan, Xuan, Minister of Propaganda Cheng is a good friend of mine when I was studying in Southern Europe. I can, can, can, can control him, can, can, control him... If you want to join the S Society as a formal member, you must come to my side."</p>
<p>Only now did Haiquan understand Yixiang's meaning. Yixiang was living in wonder, treating knowing the big figures of the S Society headquarters as an important treasure, desperately showing it off to the young people. Haiquan immediately felt the disillusionment of the future of revolutionary literature. He also thought that even if he was a revolutionary youth, why did he need to "want to meet" the important members of the S Society? He was really too pitiful, and he had mistaken his revolutionary mentor.</p>
<p>When they parted, Yixiang told Haiquan his mailing address and told him to keep it secret and not to tell it to anyone casually. Haiquan could only listen to him at this moment.</p>
<p>"If you have any questions that you don't understand, you can come and ask me, or write to me. I will explain them to you one by one, whether it is a literary theory question, a revolutionary theory question, or a social science question..."</p>
<p>"Mr., your house must have a very rich collection of books."</p>
<p>"No. Everything, everything, everything, is hidden in me. I, I, in here..."</p>
<p>Yixiang pointed to his belly and said to Haiquan. Haiquan felt that Yixiang was completely a book fanatic again.</p>
<p>In the dark and cold atmosphere, Haiquan shook hands with Yixiang and said goodbye.</p>
<p>"If you have, have, have, any works, send them to me. I, I, I, can find a way to publish them for you."</p>
<p>Haiquan was a little happy again after hearing this.</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to that revolutionary literature specialist Mr. Li Yixiang, Haiquan was shivering in the cold wind again. The north wind was blowing very hard, calling out sounds like the bombing planes of the Japanese imperialists. He felt a cold wind attacking his back in bursts.</p>
<p>"It must be twelve o'clock now. Tonight, I am a homeless person!"</p>
<p>As he walked thinking this, he felt infinite sadness and wanted to cry several times. But it seemed that the degree of sadness was not enough. His eyelids flickered a few times, but no tears came out.</p>

<h3 id="e202">An Anatomical Analysis of the Technocracy Theory by Xu Yu <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The name Technocracy is currently extremely fashionable. America is the place where this term originated, so naturally American newspapers and magazines are filled with discussions about this theory, even newsreels in sound films use Technocracy as a rallying cry. Magazines and newspapers in our country have also provided considerable introductions. This article studies the social environment that produced Technocracy entirely from an economic perspective, examines its intellectual origins, and then critiques whether its theories are sound.</p>
<p>(1) The Social Environment that Produced Technocracy</p>
<p>America is a large and resource-rich country with a relatively small population, and because it was founded not long ago, its resources have not been fully utilized. Therefore, most American economists have an optimistic outlook. Henry C. Carey, an American economist from a hundred years ago, was a very optimistic person. Of course, Carey's theory is completely different from Technocracy's theory. The former acknowledges that the world is gradually becoming harmonious, and that all social conflicts, such as labor disputes, can gradually disappear on their own. The latter believes that there is a contradiction between the current methods of production (i.e., mechanical technology production) and methods of distribution (i.e., distribution of money based on human labor). If we want to save the current society from the suffering of unemployment, we must abolish the monetary distribution system and use a capacity distribution system instead. However, both share a common feature, that is, optimism about the future. Carey believed that Ricardo's land rent theory was incorrect. Humans do not cultivate good land first and then poor land; on the contrary, they cultivate poor land first and then good land. Therefore, the future society should gradually prosper. The Technocracy group believes that the current methods of production are very developed and that the society can enjoy true happiness simply by changing the monetary unit to a capacity unit. Their future society is one where "everyone only needs to work 660 hours per year, but the standard of living can be higher than in 1929, the most prosperous period of commerce."</p>
<p>Carey's theory that poor land is cultivated before good land was completely influenced by the social environment of America at the time. At that time, the westward movement in America was in full swing, good land was gradually being developed, and the population was relatively small, so Carey had this kind of theory. This theory was very suitable for the situation at the time, but today, due to the progress of civilization and the increase in population, it has begun to waver. As for whether the optimism of the Technocracy group has a sound basis, we will discuss it later. However, if America were not so mechanically advanced and its production technology were not so advanced, this kind of discussion would never have occurred. Therefore, we can say that Technocracy is a product of the social environment.</p>
<p>(2) The Technocracy Theory of Internal Contradictions of Capitalism</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the Technocracy group believes that the capitalist method of production has entered the age of complete mechanization, while its distribution method is still based on human labor, resulting in a lack of balance between consumption and production. This is a major contradiction of capitalism. This theory seems very new, but in fact, Marx had already discussed it seventy or eighty years ago. Marx believed that the internal contradictions of capitalism had both material and artificial aspects. The material aspect includes the contradiction between the method of production and the relations of production. The so-called relations of production are class relations and property relations, in other words, distribution relations. From this, isn't Technocracy's theory of internal contradictions of capitalism greatly influenced by Marx?</p>
<p>Not only in terms of theoretical outline, is Technocracy seemingly similar to Marx; even when exposing the shortcomings of capitalism, the two groups' voices are almost identical. The Technocracy group believes that the owners of machinery account for a very small number in society, and under today's price system, the consumption power (i.e., purchasing power) obtained by this very small number of people far exceeds what they can use. Therefore, they can only reinvest this surplus purchasing power into machinery, resulting in the continued expansion of industrial machinery, a large increase in output, and the inability of society under the price system to accommodate it. The next step is a drop in prices, capitalists cannot make a profit, production stagnates, workers become unemployed, and consumption power further declines. According to Technocrats, commercial recession is unavoidable unless the price system is abolished, and this is the reason for the collapse of capitalism.</p>
<p>What did Marx say? Marx believed that the goal of capitalists is to obtain as much surplus value as possible, so they try their best to increase working hours. However, the wages earned by workers are only enough to maintain the survival of their families and themselves. At the same time, in order to obtain greater profits, capitalists reinvest the surplus value they have obtained into factories, or add machines, to increase the speed of production. As a result, output increases greatly, but the laborers who constitute the majority of consumers, their wages are only enough to maintain survival, without sufficient consumption power, thus forming overproduction, which is one of the internal contradictions of capitalism.</p>
<p>Now we can see the striking degree of similarity between the Technocracy group and Marx regarding the theory of internal contradictions of capitalism.</p>
<p>(3) Technocracy's Theory of Capacity Value</p>
<p>Since the Technocracy group believes that the main cause of social unemployment and panic is the monetary price system, their method of reform lies in abolishing the price system. They believe that the necessary condition for the price system is human labor, but human labor is no longer important in today's production, so the price system has become a burden on current society, preventing industry from continuing to work and reducing the purchasing power of the masses. They also say that gold and silver are inaccurate currencies and are not suitable for today's technologically advanced society, because what gold and silver represent is not wealth, but a debt to industry. To reform the contradictions of current society, we must recognize that the purpose of wealth is to seek social welfare, that wealth is the product of capacity, and that its measurement should be in units of capacity. The concrete form of the capacity unit is the "Energy Certificate." An Energy Certificate is based on the amount of human labor or fuel consumption required to produce a certain commodity. After obtaining this Energy Certificate, consumers have the right to equal consumption.</p>
<p>The concept of the Energy Certificate seems very novel. A similar concept is Owen's Labor Note in the 19th century. Owen established a labor exchange where anyone who brought goods to the labor exchange was given a corresponding labor note based on the time required for their work. The labor note is slightly different from the Energy Certificate, because the labor note is marked with human labor, while the Energy Certificate is marked with capacity. Human labor only occupies a small part of capacity. However, we can very well say that the Technocracy's concept of the Energy Certificate is greatly influenced by Owen.</p>
<p>(4) Can Technocracy Really Break the Price System?</p>
<p>Above, we talked about how Technocracy originated in America because America is mechanically advanced, its production technology is advanced, and its natural resources are abundant. It is the same as Carey's economic theory from a hundred years ago, both taking American society as the background. We also explained that their theory of internal contradictions of capitalism is almost entirely derived from Marx's economic theory, and that their theory of capacity value and Energy Certificate plan are undoubtedly influenced by Owen. As for their theory of insufficient consumption causing panic, economists have long talked about it, and the idea that wealth should focus on social welfare is similar to the welfare economics advocated by Hobson. But can we say that it is worthless because it copies from the east and borrows from the west?</p>
<p>This is obviously not possible. No theory in social science can be strictly said to be uniquely created. Most are hinted at and inspired by other people's theories, and then integrated. If we want to discuss whether the theory of Technocracy is sound, we must see whether its entire theoretical foundation is sound.</p>
<p>The Technocracy group believes that the crux of current society lies in the price system, which is an oversimplified view of social problems. This is because most of the figures in Technocracy are engineers and physicists, so when discussing economic problems, they often focus on the relationship between people and things and ignore the relationship between people. Currency is only a medium of exchange, chosen by humans as a standard of wealth. Of course, this medium has some negative impacts on society, but abolishing the monetary system cannot solve all social problems. Stepping back, even if the price system is the crux of society and currency is not enough to represent wealth, the price system still exists even if gold and silver are abolished and replaced with Energy Certificates. Because no matter whether the medium of exchange is currency or Energy Certificates, the ratio of exchange will always exist. Where there is a ratio of exchange, there is price; only the expressed names are different. Therefore, it is a mistake for Scott, the leader of Technocracy, to believe that Technocracy can break the price system.</p>
<p>(5) The Basic Shortcomings of Technocracy</p>
<p>The Technocracy group believes that price can be abolished, which shows that they do not understand the principle of scarcity. Not understanding scarcity is the basic shortcoming of the Technocracy group. Scarcity is not only the basic principle of economic phenomena, but also the main reason for the occurrence of all social phenomena. If there were no scarcity, we would not need laws, politics, or morality. What the law protects is only people's property rights, etc. What morality teaches is nothing more than how to adapt to social survival. Politics is a regulatory mechanism set up for public purposes. If all goods were absolutely abundant, what conflicts would people have? What need would there be for laws to protect? What need would there be for morality to teach? What need would there be for politics to maintain order? Price comes from scarcity. Air is absolutely abundant. Does air have a price?</p>
<p>The Technocracy group says: "The era of scarcity of consumer goods has passed. The current century no longer requires labor and thrift as conditions for survival in the world. ... America has rich natural resources and great machine capacity, and will surely enter a new era of civilization." However, these are only empty words without proof. They only tell us how much labor a certain flour mill uses and how much flour it produces, how many car frames a certain automobile factory can produce per day, and that a certain rayon factory only needs one worker to manage the entire factory. Even if these statistics are completely accurate, at most they only tell us that production technology has improved. The improvement of production technology and the increase of production are two different things. They cannot prove that the wheat used to make flour has increased several times, that the wood used to make car frames has increased several times, or that the raw materials used to make rayon have increased several times. There are many raw materials that cannot be produced without limits by advanced production technology. If raw materials cannot be produced without limits, what is the use of advanced production technology? How can "everyone work 660 hours per year and the standard of living be higher than in 1929?"</p>
<p>They also say that America accounts for 40% of the world's iron ore, 50% of the coal mines, 69% of the oil, and 81% of the natural gas, with 1/12 of the area and 6% of the population, which can be considered abundant. They do not know that this is still scarce, because scarcity is a relative concept. Even if all the world's resources were concentrated in America, it would not necessarily be abundant.</p>
<p>Now we can make a temporary conclusion: Technocracy is a monster that collects the theories of various schools, such as those of economists, integrates them, is influenced by the American social environment, and rises amid the decline of the American economy. The people who created this theory, because they ignore the economic principle of scarcity, inevitably make mistakes in their propositions. Although it is very popular now, it will probably be eliminated soon.</p>
<p>(Note) Although the above conclusion is said to be temporary, it is still inevitably arbitrary. Because the formal books written by the Technocracy group themselves have not yet been published, their ideas are scattered in magazines and newspapers. However, from these newspapers and magazines, we can already see the general outline of their thoughts. Whether the conclusion is reliable, let the facts prove it.

<h3 id="e203">On Technocracy by Lin Bingzhong <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>In the autumn of 1929, a major financial crisis occurred on Wall Street in New York, opening the curtain on the world economic panic. Until today, there is still no sign of recovery, and the angry tide of panic is only increasing. Economists and politicians are at a loss and simply have no way to break this situation. During this period, some people have proposed the Technocracy system to solve all economic problems. Newspapers and magazines have vigorously promoted it, and many people in our country have recently introduced this new theory. I personally have a lot of doubts about this system. Now I will briefly describe its important significance as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Proponents of Technocracy believe that the severity of the world economic panic and unemployment problems is due to the current monetary and price system. This system is a tool for capitalists to profit, so it has resulted in the concentration of capital in the hands of a few people, while the majority of people have nothing to eat. Solving the current unemployment problem means preventing capital from concentrating in the hands of a few people, which also means overthrowing the monetary and price system.</p>
<p>(2) After abolishing the monetary and price system, all goods can be measured by "Energy," and "Energy Certificates" can be issued as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>(3) The thinking of this group of people is that the basis of the economy is in machines, so all economic undertakings should be managed by scientists, who should determine the amount of production from a technical standpoint, so that it is sufficient for consumption.</p>
<p>The above three points are the propositions of this group of people. Now I will talk about my opinions on this new system based on these three points: (1) We know that the biggest reason for this economic panic is that the supply of production is too large, exceeding what consumption needs, so prices have fallen, and capitalists have tightened production and eliminated subordinates, thus forming the currently acute unemployment problem. Why has production expanded so much? In simple terms, it is because of the development of machines. Since the introduction of machines, general scientists have been improving them day by day, trying all kinds of ways to increase the efficiency of machines, so that they can produce the greatest effect with the least labor in the shortest period of time. The more developed the machines, the less the use of labor. On the other hand, the population is increasing day by day, so the unemployment problem has reached today's point. This is the cause of this world economic panic, so the more developed the machines are in a country, the more unemployed people there are. The United States is an example. This group of proponents of the Technocracy system believes that the crux of the economic panic lies in the monetary and price system, because with money, capitalists can monopolize everything, so it must be overthrown. This argument is a bit like chasing shadows. We know that money is a medium, because it is convenient, so it is used to buy goods. The ultimate desire of human beings is not for money but for goods, because with money, there can be goods, so they turn their attention to money. Even if the monetary and price system is completely destroyed, capitalists may not necessarily have no desire to seize goods, and they may not necessarily be unable to seize goods, right?</p>
<p>(2) In the past, Adam Smith advocated that "Labor" should be the basis of the value of all goods. He also knew that "Labor" cannot be accurately valued, so there is also a "Theory of Exchange Value." Now, the proponents of the Technocracy system also advocate using energy as the standard of value. The so-called energy here is of course the energy of human labor and machines. Then how should "energy" be valued? The energy used to manufacture a car can be measured. How should the teaching of teachers be measured? Service is also a kind of production!</p>
<p>They also advocate issuing "Energy Certificates" to purchase goods. Then "Energy Certificates" can be regarded as a kind of medium of exchange. What is the difference between them and money? If capitalists can seize money, can't they seize "Energy Certificates"? So this is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>(3) It is undeniable that current production is purely machine production. The manufacture and improvement of machines depend on the research and inventions of scientists, but it cannot be assumed that scientists can solve all economic problems by inventing machines. Economic undertakings cannot start without scientists, but scientists may not necessarily be omnipotent. With science, other social sciences can be abandoned. This group of people attaches too much importance to scientists. They want to cross the boundaries of natural science and invade the scope of social science, talking a lot about solving the recent economic panic with technology. However, they do not know that the problems in natural science are completely different from the social environment. Technology can only improve production and cannot solve the economic panic caused by overproduction and falling prices.</p>
<p>This system is just being established, and detailed works have not yet been published. The above are just my doubts that I have raised and talked about. Perhaps the papers they publish in the future will be able to explain all my doubts, which is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e204">A Review of "Technocracy" by Liang Ming <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The emergence of all theories is nothing more than adapting to the needs of the times. Their ability to be welcomed and disseminated is mostly due to adapting to the times. For example, the severity of the unemployment problem caused by the industrial revolution in the 18th century created the position of Malthus's "Theory of Population." The economic reconstruction required by Germany and Italy after the war led to the rise of fascism. The "Technocracy" that is currently making a lot of noise in American newspapers and magazines is nothing more than a product of the economic panic in the golden country.</p>
<p>"Technocracy" is now not only being enthusiastically studied in academic circles in America, but is also attracting attention in various European countries. In the future, its power may further increase and have a greater impact, but its content, as it currently exists, is very simple.</p>
<p>"Technocracy" is advocated by a group of scientists in America, whose leader is Howard Scott. They organized a group to study the material aspects of society's functions in North America. The object of their greatest attention is production technology, that is, English Technology. Based on this word, they call their group Technocracy. Since its establishment twelve years ago, they have studied no fewer than 3,000 industries and created many patterns, analyzing the material functions of North America very clearly.</p>
<p>As a result of Technocracy's research on North America's material capabilities, they recently published their reports and propositions. They believe that in the past 30 years, the invention of new machines and the application of automation have progressed rapidly, and all production organizations have been technologized. The result of this excessive technological progress has conflicted with America's old economic system, that is, the price system in the original distribution can no longer adapt to the new technologized production organization. The most obvious example is the severity of the widespread unemployment problem. It was previously thought that it could be solved by improving production technology, but now it is known that the improvement of production technology causes unemployment problems. The more advanced the production technology, the more it will promote the severity of unemployment problems.</p>
<p>But they are not like the early Guild Socialists or individual anarchists who hate the improvement of production technology because the invention of machinery causes corresponding evils. They are all the opposite. They believe that the improvement of technology is an inevitable trend, and what is wrong is that the current price system cannot adapt to the emerging production technology. They believe that finance or prices expressed in gold and silver belong to the past and cannot do anything about the current economic panic. All social life is dominated by the laws of physics. In the laws of physics, "Energy" is the source of all production and social life. With the progress of technology, since money belongs to the past, the distribution system should be determined based on each person's "Energy." Although the expression of energy has various forms, the size of energy can be determined by the unit of work. Therefore, issuing "Energy Certificates" to replace the current currency can enable the balanced development of production technology and work distribution, so that there will be no problems of unemployment and economic panic today. For example, Scott expounds on this theory in his article "Technology Breaks the Price System." As for the detailed implementation methods, they have not yet published them, and how their insights are is unknown. The explanation of the principle is only this much.</p>
<p>We do not deny the influence of "Technocracy," and it may become even more lively in the near future, but there is no need to overemphasize its actual value. Some people criticize the once-sensational Malthus's theory of population, which still has lingering effects, saying: "It is only the prejudice of factions that makes people pay attention to this little book." Similarly, it is only because the American economic panic has no way out that people pay attention to the voice in the silence, Technocracy. With the progress of social science, the fact that human social relations are by no means comparable to natural relations such as the laws of physics is something that does not need to be debated.</p>
<p>However, this theory is not without some lessons for our country now. That is, technology and social relations are inseparable. Revitalizing China is not something that can be achieved by simply improving production. On the contrary, America has been harmed under the condition of high production.</p>
<p>Letter of Correction</p>
<p>To whom it may concern, In my article "Obstacles to Cooperatives" in the last issue, there were occasional references to the cooperative office of the Central Political School in Nanjing, which was actually due to errors in hearsay. I now know that the school's cooperative is indeed one of the most successful consumer cooperatives in the country and does not receive any subsidies. It is said that those in charge of it are Mr.s from the China Cooperative Society. I am specially introducing it and asking for a correction.</p>

<p>Public Bonds Continued to Advance to Higher Levels Last Week</p>
<p>Rose by About One to Three Yuan Compared to the Previous Week</p>
<p>Trading was Most Active Among the Northern Factions and Money Shops</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Closed for Three Days Starting Today for Arbor Day</p>
<p>From March 27th to April 1st of last week, the market for public bonds at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was extremely robust, with a promising upward trend. Firstly, the market price did not weaken after settlement; secondly, the May futures, once launched for trading, opened high one after another. Both of these factors sufficiently demonstrate the continued high demand from various factions and the increasing number of investors. In reality, since the government has not issued new bonds since 1932, the market feels a shortage. On the other hand, it can also prove that the government's finances are in order. Taken together, it is clear that domestic bonds have gradually gotten on the right track. Calculating at the highest market price on Friday, most were equivalent to 758 per one tael of customs gold for the 1918 issue, and around 76 for the 1918 customs issue. The 1931 and 1932 issues were still insufficient. Once the U.S. silver loan is established, the government will have no need to issue new public bonds. Furthermore, bonds have withstood the severe situation after the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, as well as the serious situation in North China. Under such extreme pressure, the financial community still absorbed them, so the public's understanding of bonds has gradually become clearer, especially with the painful realization of the difficulty of speculative trading. Recently, there has also been talk of the Japanese abandoning the use of force. Except for Thursday, when the market was closed for settlement, and Saturday, when rumors caused a drop of about one yuan, the price rose gradually every day for the remaining four days of last week. The most significant increase was on Friday. As a result, the price rose by about one to three yuan compared to the previous week. Trading was mostly done by the Northern factions and money shops, with quite busy trading by retail investors. Buying treasures was quite active, and financial short-term public bonds, which had long been unattended, suddenly began to be traded. Three sessions were opened throughout the day, with market prices ranging from eighteen yuan to fifty-eight yuan and one dime. It is said that this was due to banks closing in on millions, with no other reason. The total number of transactions for the week amounted to 52.802 million yuan, including 22,000 yuan in spot goods and 12.835 million yuan in futures. Salt tax alone accounted for 19.77 million, and disbandment accounted for more than 8.1 million. The 1918 customs gold and general issues together accounted for 8.73 million, and the 1931 and 1932 issues accounted for 12 million. The remaining issues ranged from 500,000 to 2 million. The stock exchange will be closed for three days starting today for Arbor Day.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than twenty stores from various factions in Hexia arrived. The market shape for white japonica from the white japonica store moved to rise two dimes. Thin japonica added one dime. Early rice arrived less, sales were active, and the price added two chǐ. Yangbu Jian arrived with sales evenly priced close to chǐ. Du Jian also added chǐ. Foreign Kejian and Yin Yuan were stable. White Yuan also had a tight discount.</p>

<p>Domestic Sliced Qing Label Plate Further Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still relatively stable. The association's plate for No. 24 coarse granulated white ordinary was still marked at 15 liang and 2 fen and a half, without any ups or downs. However, the top coarse RA mark rose by 5 fen due to lack of bottom goods, marked at 15 liang and 3 qian and a half. No. 20 medium granulated white was called at 14 liang and 6 qian, and No. 18 at 14 liang and 4 qian, but there were few transactions and seemed to be loosening. No. 89 Dutch red was still at 11 liang and 9 qian. Sliced Qing suffered from sluggish sales and the weather was gradually getting hotter, so there was concern about oil production. Therefore, the label plate initially loosened secretly and then clearly decreased. Yesterday, the market opened with about 300-400 small boxes of sliced Qing, priced at 6 liang and 4 qian, down 3 qian compared to the previous day. According to the label family's intention, if there is a whole batch transaction, it is still possible to continue loosening. Hainan red North City label family continued to open more than 100 bags, priced at 10 liang and 4 qian and a half. Sufficiently high-grade ice white sugar was expected to increase by 4 qian and a half, but each bank could not agree for a while and no plate was formed.</p>

<p>Foreign Banks' Silk Inventory Still Low at the End of the Third Month</p>
<p>Foreign firms are purchasing little silk as spring arrives, total inventory is only over 800 bales.</p>
<p>Global economic instability has caused European and American silk sales to plummet, and Chinese silk quotations are gradually decreasing. Since the beginning of spring, foreign firms in Shanghai have not dared to risk buying silk, either for spot or futures. Silk inventories are low. According to a survey of various foreign firms, the total inventory of factory white, yellow, and gray silks at the end of March was 860 bales, of which 305 bales were prepared for shipment to the Americas, 340 bales to Europe, and 215 bales to Asia. This is a decrease of about 100 bales compared to the end of February.</p>

<p>Rayon, which inland silk merchants in Shanghai purchased the right to manufacture summer silk fabrics, has been delivered by various foreign firms at the end of last month. Because inland silk factories are in great need of raw materials, the factories have successively shipped out the remaining silk. Yesterday and today, 343 boxes have been exported, of which 260 boxes were loaded to various ports along the Yangtze River and 83 boxes were transported to Hangzhou and Huzhou.</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter Four: The Situation of Business</p>
<p>We in the medical community value those physicians who specialize in serving in hospitals and medical school professors because they receive very little salary and do a lot of work, and do not want to extract any great profits from society. This shows that they are willing to sacrifice their own enjoyment and go into the direction of academic research. In the future, all medical progress in China will mostly rely on this group of people. Unfortunately, the Shanghai Medical School has not made much progress in the last ten years, and most of the hospitals are still in the hands of foreigners. There are not many such people. People in society often think that very popular practicing physicians can definitely invent something in medicine, but the more popular they are, the busier they are, and the result is the opposite. In addition, we must also strongly encourage physicians in charitable hospitals, no matter how their academics are. Only then will people be willing to serve in hospitals for charitable causes for life. At present, people in society pay the least attention to these two types of physicians, and especially do not sympathize with physicians in hospitals, because physicians who are willing to stay in hospitals for a long time have calm personalities, and may not be well-rounded in dealing with patients. However, our country's patients have been hypnotized by the historical contempt for doctors, and they most like the doctor's flattery and perfunctory treatment. Many foreign professors often use a commanding attitude to treat patients, which is not acceptable in China. Therefore, even foreigners in Shanghai cater to social psychology to a great extent, and the general wealthy merchants are most easily fooled.</p>
<p>Most of the old foreign doctors in Shanghai are still quite disciplined. In terms of academics, even if they were not very good in their early years, they have now experimented very well by taking China as a testing product. However, they are gradually taking some "appeasement measures" when treating Chinese people. This is their way of catering to social psychology, and it is also proof that they are familiar with China. It is the result of the Chinese themselves being good at being perfunctory. In the last ten years, the number of foreign doctors coming to Shanghai has greatly increased. Because after the European War, foreign medicine made rapid progress, a group of formal experts came because of the needs of foreigners in Shanghai. Also, because of the large number of doctors trained in various countries every year, a group of people who are not very good also came to solve the problem of bread and butter specifically for the Chinese. The steps for this type of foreign doctors to open a business in Shanghai are nothing more than first finding his own country's merchants in Shanghai, and being introduced by his own country's merchants to his Chinese compradors. The Chinese compradors invite him to eat Chinese food and get to know a group of Chinese merchants. During the dinner, he flatters and brags to the fullest extent. How can Chinese people resist the flattery of blue-eyed, high-nosed people? Naturally, they are flattered. Then, they introduce some patients to him. If the treatment goes wrong, they really dare not say half a word of complaint. If the treatment goes well, they will fall to the ground in admiration. When the business is good, the clinic will be bigger, and the bills for the equipment owed to the foreign firm will be paid off. They will then settle down in Shanghai. At that time, when someone in the family of the original introducer is sick and wants to ask him to come, he often puts on airs, saying that a certain military commander has asked him to quit smoking, and a certain minister's wife has asked him to deliver a baby, and he is too busy to get away for a while.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that there are also a few people in our medical community who like to cooperate with foreign slippery doctors to do business. I don't know whether it is appropriate to call them accomplices or accomplices? Last winter, I also saw a case of chronic breast cancer with a Russian doctor. According to his opinion, it was a minor problem and would be cured after taking a few days of medicine. I said that the cervical glands were swollen and the head was affected. I am afraid that the small size of the local cancer cannot be ignored. He seemed not very understanding. Later, the patient certainly took his manageable and simple statement. So the Russian sent two bottles of black medicine made with Eubiosae (a kind of tonic), but it was not Eubiose. Unfortunately, the patient died after taking it for only three days. He could not be a long-term customer of the Russian. Although the fact is like this, I always feel that in Shanghai, where there are no rules for medicine and pharmaceuticals, perhaps the Russian doctor will still have a very bright future by relying on language barriers. Only Dr. Schmidt and so on, who once sued me eight years ago and specialized in using anti-aging to appeal to people, was finally bombarded back. It seems that he did not even pay off the equipment fees of a certain foreign company. He can be considered one of the most unlucky foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Reasons Why Gonorrhea is Difficult to Cure and the Correct Treatment Method (Part 1) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Junshou</p>
<p>The most common medical and pharmaceutical advertisements in newspapers are for gonorrhea. Electrical therapy, injection therapy, internal medicine to eradicate the root, secret prescription for white turbid urine, white turbid urine grass, etc., are really diverse and strange. However, since there are so many treatment methods, why can't gonorrhea be cured? Now, I will first write down the reasons why gonorrhea is difficult to cure one by one below:</p>
<p>(1) The nature of gonococcus: Gonococcus most likes to exist in the urethra and has the nature of permanent survival. Therefore, if gonococcus is not eliminated, gonorrhea cannot be cured. However, to kill gonococcus, it is necessary to use bactericidal methods. For example, if drug therapy or physical therapy is used, if a severe method is used, although it can completely kill the gonococcus, the urethral tissue will be damaged. If a mild method is used, it is difficult to see results.</p>
<p>(2) The relationship of urethral tissue: The urethral mucosa itself has an epithelial cell lining to prevent the invasion of external harmful poisons. When gonococcus invades the urethra, it multiplies and develops, and the urethral mucosa is attacked by gonococcus and its toxins. Inflammation occurs in the mucosa, and the epithelial cells are peeled off. At this time, the patient feels pain when urinating and yellow-white pus flows out, which is the time of acute gonorrhea. However, gonococcus not only invades the surface of the mucosa, but also invades the tissue under the mucosa. Although this invasion of the deep part of the gonococcus causes severe inflammation for a while, the urethral tissue soon undergoes changes due to the inflammation, and because of the accumulation of its own toxins, the reproductive power of gonococcus is significantly weakened. Therefore, the symptoms on the urethra are reduced, just like a cure. In fact, at this time, it has moved to chronic gonorrhea, and the treatment is even more difficult. Moreover, in the case of chronic gonorrhea, gonococcus often lurks in the urethral lateral ducts, Ma's selling, Li's gland, etc. When washing with drug liquid, only the gonococcus on the surface of the urethra can be killed. The lurking gonococcus will still come out to make trouble when it encounters an opportunity.</p>
<p>(3) There is no ideal treatment method because</p>
<p>gonorrhea is difficult to cure. Although there are various treatment methods, there is no ideal good method, that is, there is no method that can completely cure gonorrhea. Now, I will describe all the therapies one by one below:</p>
<p>A. Internal medicine: There are many internal medicines used for gonorrhea, but there is no specific medicine (specific medicine means that a medicine has a specific effect on a certain disease and can cure the root, such as 606 for syphilis, diphtheria serum for diphtheria, quinine for malaria, these can all be called specific medicines). This is the most commonly recognized by the medical community around the world. The most used are sandalwood oil agents, Cuban balm agents, urotropine, methylthionine, etc., all urethral disinfectants, and analgesics, sedatives, anti-inflammatory agents, hemostatics, etc., can be used, but none can be called specific drugs. Moreover, some people have taken sandalwood oil agents and have developed loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, nephritis, etc. Some people have taken Cuban balm agents and have developed skin rashes. Therefore, medicines can be used, but unfortunately there are no specific drugs.</p>
<p>B. Diathermy: Gonococcus can die when it encounters high heat, but if the urethra needs to get such high heat, the urethral mucosa has already been unbearable for such high heat before the gonococcus dies. Therefore, diathermy therapy, which was started thirty years ago, still failed.</p>
<p>C. Light and electricity: Some people say that light (such as purple light) and electricity can kill gonococcus, but in fact, after various experiments, it has not been recognized by the academic community.</p>
<p>D. Injection of vaccine: Injection</p>
<h3 id="e217">Observations on the Current State of Medicine in Society (Part 1) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>If someone were to ask: "Which country in the world has the most widespread knowledge of medicine?" Then I can offer an answer without hesitation: "Only the Republic of China." Because no matter how remote and desolate a place you go, if you find an ignorant old woman or old man and ask them, they can at least rattle off many, many names of medicines and their uses – for treating cold or heat, detoxification, or aiding digestion. Moreover, quack doctors hanging up signs to practice, hereditary doctors, specialists in internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, and even those selling dog skin plaster and concocting infallible elixirs are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Logically, since medical knowledge in China is so widespread and there are so many medical experts, the national mortality rate should be the lowest in the world. But the result is quite the opposite. Why is that? To answer this question, let’s first take a look at the general state of medicine in Chinese society.</p>
<p>Deeply rooted in Chinese society and believed by the majority of the people is, of course, traditional Chinese medicine. China is such a large country with such a long cultural history; can it be that there are no effective prescriptions or skilled medical practitioners? Why has Chinese medicine remained stagnant for thousands of years? This requires a discussion of the fundamental problems of Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Chinese medicine has always been mentioned alongside astrology and divination. Yet the foundation of medicine, which concerns human life, is built on the highly mysterious principles of yin and yang and the five elements. The general public still flocks to it, which is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>Because Chinese medicine lacks a scientific basis, and the government does not have procedures for licensing or registering doctors, anyone who recognizes a few characters and can scribble a jumbled list of memorized drug names into a prescription can hang up a sign and start practicing medicine. Inevitably, people come to them to die. Fortunately, science in China is underdeveloped, so there is no way to verify whether someone died from illness or from being poisoned by medicine. And our people are generally content and accepting of fate: "If they die, then so be it; it's destiny." Among these many executioners – the incompetent doctors – most can be divided into two groups: one is the itinerant quack, who has learned a few catchphrases and remembers some stock terms like wind, cold, heat, dampness, ascent, descent, dissipation, and can then spout nonsense. This group mostly treats external and miscellaneous ailments. The other group is the pedantic scholar: they can’t understand the books they read, can’t make a career in government, find teaching unrewarding, and private schools are being banned. They lack the qualifications and prestige to become local leaders or gentry, and are unable to do anything else. Helpless, they hang up a sign as a Confucian doctor and muddle through. That's another group. Besides these two groups, there are also not a few who transform</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>from shop assistants in pharmacies into doctors. Although their origins are different, they are united in killing without shedding blood. They all believe that "medicine relies on intention," and are accustomed to hearing the mantra "the five elements generate and overcome each other." The only thing that is vaguely unclear in their minds is how many unjustly dead spirits are accumulating under their respective signs.</p>
<p>Since Chinese medicine is so unreliable and everyone values their life, logically it should be declining day by day, and Western medicine should be rising in response. But in fact, the influence of Western medicine in society is still far behind that of Chinese medicine. Why is this?</p>
<p>There is a popular saying in society: "Medicine depends on luck, illness depends on chance." The state of medicine in general society is truly summed up in a single phrase. Because many ailments can heal without medicine, and many ingredients in Chinese medicine are irrelevant or of minimal relevance to the human body, many patients who are examined by a doctor and take Chinese medicine gradually recover. Naturally, the credit is given to the doctor, so both the doctor and the patient are lucky. As for the possibility that the illness might have healed faster without medicine, they don't consider it. As for those who die after taking Chinese medicine, they have another popular saying to explain it: "There is no medicine for fatal illnesses." This is the biggest reason why Chinese medicine can remain popular in general society.</p>

<p>(2) The Delivery Bed</p>
<p>Ordinary bedding is suitable enough. Soft and thick bedding is actually more inconvenient. Cover the bedding with oilcloth or rubber sheeting, and then cover it with a clean sheet. If you want to be even more meticulous, add another layer of oilcloth or rubber sheeting on top of the sheet, and then cover it with a clean sheet. Be sure to avoid staining the bed with filth during delivery.</p>
<p>If the delivery room is large, the delivery bed can be placed in the center of the room. Otherwise, the mother should face the wall with her head, and her feet toward the end with light.</p>
<p>(3) Delivery Clothing</p>
<p>Delivery clothing should be loose-fitting. A single-layer garment or nightgown is fine. If wearing a long gown, the lower half must be lifted to avoid staining it with blood or other filth. After delivery, immediately change into pre-warmed clothing.</p>
<p>The pillow should be slightly high, and the blanket should be light and thin. Immediately after delivery, change to a thicker blanket to keep warm.</p>
<p>(4) Position to be Taken by the Mother During Childbirth</p>
<p>Each country in the world has its own traditional customs, but even within China, each province, county, township, and village has its own different customs. The most common practice for childbirth is for the mother to sit on a basin. This is presumably to increase the force of expulsion and shorten the duration of labor. Although the intention is profound, excessive force can cause excessive pressure on the uterus, leading to uterine inversion or prolapse, or even premature rupture of the membranes, causing the baby's hand or umbilical cord to prolapse, which is extremely dangerous. The most common practices now</p>
<p>are the "supine position" or the "lateral position." These two positions have little effect on the expulsive force.</p>
<p>For the expulsion and afterbirth stages, or when applying abdominal pressure, the "semi-recumbent position," with the upper body propped up, is most appropriate.</p>
<p>If the uterus is in the correct position, the abdominal wall is sufficiently tense, the fetal position is normal, and the presenting part of the fetus is already fixed in the pelvis, then the mother can take whatever position is comfortable for her.</p>
<p>If the baby's head is still moving at the upper end of the pelvic inlet, then the "supine position" should be taken, because the pelvis is wide. If labor pains are severe and delivery may be too rapid, then the "lateral position" should be taken.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Aesthetics and Scientific Protection of Breasts (Part 1) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Tao Bingzhen</p>
<p>Three Types of Breasts</p>
<p>There are originally three shapes of breasts: disc-shaped, hemispherical, and conical. A disc-shaped breast is one in which the height is shorter than the radius of the base. A hemispherical breast is one in which the height is roughly equal to the radius of the base. A conical breast is one in which the tip tapers sharply. Ugly barbarians tend to have conical breasts. As for civilized people, hemispherical and disc-shaped breasts are more common. Moreover, it is best if they are neither too large nor too small. Too large indicates excessive fat; too small indicates weak secondary sexual characteristics. Neither is good for health or beauty.</p>
<p>The Proper Position of Breasts</p>
<p>The most important thing is their position. The ideal position is with the nipple at the fourth rib, or at least at the fifth rib. If both arms are extended to the left and right, draw a straight line from the base of the upper arm along the lower edge of the pectoralis major muscle toward the chest. Also, on the chest line, draw a vertical line connecting the armpit. The intersection of these two lines is where the nipple, the center of the breast, should be located. In that configuration with the curves of the whole body is most beautiful. Moreover, it is best if its position remains unchanged during body movement. The breast must be slightly firm, tight, and strong, with the mammary glands closely attached to the pectoral muscle. If there is too much fat and the skin is loose, then it will immediately droop. When lying down, it will droop to the left and right, making it difficult to maintain a proper position. The nipple should not be too small, too large, or inverted, but should protrude appropriately. The areola surrounding it should be a perfect circle.</p>
<p>The Development Process of Breasts</p>
<p>During infancy, there is no difference between males and females; only a slight trace is visible. Girls from the ages of eleven to thirteen, the nipple and surrounding areola take on a milky red color and rise slightly, this shape resembles a flower bud about to open. Later, the mammary glands inside the breast develop and gradually rise, forming a conical hill. This is the bud-like breast, the state of development of a girl around the age of fifteen or sixteen. After this, it enters the third stage of maturity. Fat increases and the whole body completes a beautiful curve. At the same time, the breast also becomes round and soft due to the subcutaneous fat.</p>
<p>The Destruction of Breast Beauty</p>
<p>If the beauty of mature breasts is not affected by constitution, pregnancy, breastfeeding, living conditions, nourishment, etc., it can be maintained until a considerable old age. However, for most women, once they reach middle age, due to obesity or thinness, the beauty of the breasts disappears.</p>
<p>More Than One Pair of Breasts</p>
<p>The number of breasts is originally limited to one pair, but some women have two pairs, three pairs, or even more. In these women, one pair of breasts develops in the normal way, but there are smaller breasts above and below them. These are usually not very noticeable. However, once pregnant, although small in size, they also develop into the shape of breasts. This is a kind of atavism. It is said that such women are likely to have twins.</p>
<p>Breasts of Different Sizes</p>
<p>Breasts of different sizes only become apparent when the breasts develop to maturity at a considerable age. Most differences are not significant. If the size difference is large, it is ugly. Usually, the left breast is slightly larger.</p>
<p>Prevention of Drooping Breasts</p>
<p>If the attachment of the breast to the pectoral muscle below loosens, its position will change and become a drooping breast. Breasts that are too fatty and have too much fat, and breasts that are too thin and atrophied, often turn into drooping breasts. The method of prevention, of course, requires efforts to protect the breasts during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Paying attention to exercise and gymnastics at ordinary times is also effective, but it is only: exercising muscles to support the breasts, and making the chest protrude to maintain the beauty of the breasts.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Development of Modern Medicine <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>In 1776, Priestley discovered nitrous oxide gas; later, Humphry Davy also discovered that this gas has anesthetic properties. Davy then became the Director of the Bristol Institute. He had many opportunities to observe the inhalation of gases. He had also experimented with nitrous oxide. On April 9, 1799, he experimented on himself and found that the gas had toxic effects and could cure toothache. In 1800, he published this fact and suggested that this nitrous oxide could be used in surgery. However, until 1844, no one ever used this gas as an anesthetic. Ether was discovered by Raymond Lully in the 19th century. Later, many people studied its properties, but until 1730, it had not yet been named "ether." Before that, it was only used as a stimulant. In 1795, Pearson of Birmingham used it as an inhalant for asthma and tuberculosis. A few years later, Woolcombe of Plymouth also used ether inhalation to treat asthma attacks and discovered that continued inhalation for a long time would cause the patient to lose consciousness.</p>
<p>In 1818, Michael Faraday reported that inhaling ether vapor could produce the same anesthetic effect as inhaling nitrous oxide. In the following twenty years, the anesthetic properties of ether were further confirmed by many American physicians; however, it had not yet been applied to surgery.</p>
<p>In 1842, American doctor Crawford Long used ether inhalation to excise a small tumor on the neck of a patient; the patient did not feel pain at the time. In September 1846, Morton of Boston, on the advice of C. P. Jackson, used ether to extract a tooth; the patient also felt no pain. Therefore, Morton patented ether in England and the United States under the name "Letheon." On October 16 of that year, he assisted J. C. Warren in using this drug to perform anesthesia and remove a tumor on the neck. This anesthesia was completely successful, which aroused the interest of many doctors present. At that time, because Morton kept the composition of the drug a secret, some surgeons were still hesitant about the application of this drug. However, from that peculiar smell, it was soon known that the composition of this anesthetic was actually ether; thus, the use of this drug became much wider than before. Soon after, the news spread to London. On December 19 of that year, a dentist, Robinson, performed a tooth extraction under ether anesthesia in London. Two days later, Robert Liston of the University Hospital also used ether anesthesia to saw off a patient's leg. This operation only took thirty-two seconds. Because Liston was not yet completely convinced of the effect of ether, he performed the surgery particularly quickly, just as if no anesthesia had been used.</p>
<p>From then on, ether was widely used in surgical operations. Although some people still did not use it at the time, their opposition could not last long.</p>
<p>Dr. James Simpson of Edinburgh adopted ether very early; however, he still felt dissatisfied and wanted to discover a substance that had the advantages of ether but none of its disadvantages. He collected many medicinal liquids that were considered to have anesthetic effects and conducted experiments. Every night, he and his assistants would first inhale one substance and then inhale another to test their relative benefits. They experimented with so many medicinal liquids that it was almost a year before they experimented with chloroform. This chloroform was a medicinal liquid discovered separately by three researchers in 1831. At the time, it was thought to be of little use. Later, Simpson, on the recommendation of Waldie, a chemist from Liverpool, added his small gift for testing and discovered the anesthetic effect of this medicinal liquid.</p>
<p>On November 4, 1847, Simpson and two friends began to inhale chloroform vapor. Soon they all lost consciousness. When they woke up, they realized that they were all lying on the floor. At this time, Simpson realized that chloroform was stronger and better than ether. At that time, they compared and studied each other and were all convinced that what they had discovered was a useful new anesthetic. That night, they experimented several times again, not dispersing until late at night until they obtained satisfactory results. Subsequently, three patients underwent surgery with chloroform anesthesia, and the results were very good.</p>
<p>Soon after, the British immediately began to use chloroform instead of ether; however, around 1868, a change occurred, and a part of the doctors continued to use ether from then on. Now it is said that although Scotland is still using chloroform, England is exclusively using ether. As for the United States, especially the northern part, ether is preferred.</p>
<p>In the tropics, such as in India, chloroform is still more suitable. This is because ether evaporates at lower temperatures, such as around 96 degrees Fahrenheit, while the boiling point of chloroform is at 140 degrees.</p>
<p>Although nitrous oxide was the first anesthetic, it was soon abandoned; however, in 1863, American dentists reintroduced it, saying that it was most convenient for simple operations such as tooth extraction, not only could it completely anesthetize, and it was safe to use, acted quickly, and patients recovered quickly, and there were few unpleasant aftereffects. Because the effect does not last long, its use is limited to tooth extraction and incision of abscesses and other short-term operations. However, in recent years, mixing nitrous oxide with oxygen has also been suitable for longer-lasting surgeries, but the cost is higher. Although there are still various anesthetics and mixtures of various anesthetics, their use is not very large after all. In fact, ether, chloroform, and nitrous oxide are still the most widely used.</p>

<p>The Formation of a European Executive Committee Composed of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany</p>
<p>No Threats to the Little Entente and Poland</p>
<p>Mutual Consultation to Maintain European Peace for Ten Years</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd - The French Ambassador to Italy, Yvon, yesterday issued an article to newspaper reporters, stating that France has accepted the view of the France, Germany, Italy, and England group. However, France is currently very concerned about not threatening the ten countries. Recently, it has been said that the Roman agreement is not a true agreement. He has taken responsibility from Rome to the North, which is of utmost importance, in order to avoid misunderstandings and ensure European peace for ten years.</p>
<p>Those who carry European peace for ten years are using this kind of view in the countries involved, so as not to use excuses that are not conducive to neighboring countries. According to reports, after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini talked with British Prime Minister [MacDonald] in Rome, the above remarks were issued by the French official.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd - The British Ambassador to France yesterday submitted a document to the French Foreign Minister that has been revised from Prime Minister Mussolini's plan submitted to British Prime Minister MacDonald in Rome. According to French newspapers, this document is a completely new draft of the British revised plan. It is closely related to the British Prime Minister's disarmament plan, but there are no unconditional statements regarding treaty revisions.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 2nd - French Ambassador to Italy Jouvenel has made an important declaration to the representative of this agency regarding Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's Four-Power Treaty plan, and has further explained that "Mussolini's proposal makes the effectiveness of the Locarno Treaty even more substantial. According to the Locarno Treaty, Britain and Italy guarantee the boundaries between France and Germany, as well as between Belgium and Germany, in order to maintain peace between those countries. If Britain and Italy show a preference for one of the aforementioned countries, the Locarno Treaty will lose its effectiveness. Mussolini's plan does not intend to subject the three continents of Europe, Asia, and America to the will of the four powers. There are other countries on each continent, which were not suddenly dismissed during the four-power talks. This is something that the public should recognize. All current issues can be summarized as follows: Should the four Western powers reach a compromise, or should they allow their respective opinions to exist? The key to the whole situation lies in this."</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 2nd - Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu continues to meet with various important French figures. This morning, he met with former Prime Minister Taittinger, the leader of the right wing, and in the afternoon, he met with Jouvenel, the recently returned French Ambassador to Italy.</p>

<p>Retaining Takahashi as Finance Minister and Koyama as Justice Minister</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd - Prime Minister Saito arrived at Tokyo Station at 4:50 p.m. yesterday. After returning to his private residence in Yotsuya Minamicho, Chief Cabinet Secretary Horikiri visited him and had a cordial talk for several hours before leaving.</p>
<p>Nichiren, Tokyo, 3rd - Regarding Prime Minister Saito's meeting with Prince Saionji, before reporting to the cabinet meeting, he must obtain the understanding of the elders of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, Finance Minister Takahashi and Home Minister Yamamoto. The Prime Minister decided to meet with the two ministers before the cabinet meeting on the 4th.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd - Prime Minister Saito plans to summon Finance Minister Takahashi, Home Minister Yamamoto, and Justice Minister Koyama to the official residence separately before the regular cabinet meeting on the 4th to report on the results of his visit to Prince Saionji. He will also openly and honestly express his beliefs regarding the future political situation and seek the opinions of the two elders and Justice Minister Koyama. He also plans to retain Finance Minister Takahashi and Justice Minister Koyama.</p>
<p>Nichiren, Tokyo, 3rd - Minseito observers have temporarily decided on a policy of no political change, restoring the credibility of political parties, and establishing policies, and are now actively carrying out their plans: (1) Establishing policy guidelines, the Policy Investigation Council will establish a new agency to investigate new foreign policies after withdrawing from the League of Nations, as well as the reorganization of administration, finance, and taxation, and concrete methods for ideological education countermeasures. (2) Expanding the youth department, the city council election battle starting on April 8, the headquarters will dispatch a large number of activists to lobby, and President Wakatsuki will control the national lobbying plan.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd - Prime Minister Saito's visit to Prince Saionji is of great significance to the future situation and is highly valued by all parties. However, after the Prime Minister met with Prince Saionji, he strongly denied the rumors of political change and claimed to deal well with the situation, even to the death. Therefore, the voice of political stability spread for a time. However, the Prime Minister's statement was aimed at stabilizing the political situation for a time. In fact, his state of mind was the opposite of this. After the aftermath of the Diet is completed, the May 25th Incident comes to an end, and before the next fiscal year's budget is compiled, he will resign. This was the original intention and remains unchanged to this day. Also, Prince Saionji believes that if Prime Minister Saito resigns at the present time, when it is not yet determined who will succeed him, it is better to let the Prime Minister stay in office temporarily and retire at an appropriate time. This is the truth. Yesterday, at Okitsu, Saionji and Saito met with this intention. On the one hand, Finance Minister Takahashi, the central force of the cabinet, has a very firm intention to resign. Prime Minister Saito is trying his best to retain him because of his associated relationship. However, Finance Minister Takahashi's intention is that there is no problem for the Prime Minister to resign within a few days. If he stays, it is to respect the position of Suzuki, the President of the Seiyukai. It is heard that he has already told the Prime Minister about this matter. The government department plans to approve Finance Minister Takahashi's individual resignation and replace him with someone else in order to extend the life of the cabinet. However, if Finance Minister Takahashi resigns, then Public Works Minister Hatoyama, etc., who also belong to the Seiyukai, will naturally be uneasy. In addition, Justice Minister Koyama, when meeting with the Prime Minister on the 31st, stated that he would take responsibility for the unfortunate incident and wished to resign immediately. Therefore, the Justice Minister will resign after the May 15th Incident and the Redification of Judicial Officials come to an end. As a result, Home Minister Yamamoto, Education Minister Hatoyama, etc., will also not be able to stay calm. Therefore, although the Prime Minister plans to visit each cabinet member separately within a few days, report on the details of the meeting with Prince Saionji, and retain them again, it is impossible for Finance Minister Takahashi to stay in office. Moreover, the Prime Minister himself has always had very weak confidence in his ability to govern the country in times of emergency and will still resign at an appropriate time after observing the situation. This is the general observation.</p>

<p>Reuters, Moscow, 2nd - Six British technicians from the British company Vickers Electrical Company were previously detained on March 12th, accused of sabotage, hoping to destroy Soviet electrical plants in order to achieve the goal of destroying the Russian electrical industry. Subsequently, all but one were released one after another, but now they have been detained again. Mengkers and Nordwal, the first two who were released on March 14th, were arrested again today and formally charged with espionage of military and economic secrets, sabotage, and serious bribery. The remaining four technicians, three of whom were released on bail, have also been detained, but the charges against them have not yet been announced. What is currently known is that all six will be tried by the Soviet Russian court. Today, the British Charge d'Affaires in Russia, Sterling, accompanied a Soviet Russian prosecutor into the prison to visit. After leaving, he told people that the health of those arrested was normal. There are rumors that the staff of the British Embassy in Russia are now preparing to pack up and return to England, but Reuters has learned from responsible sources in London that there is no basis for the statement that British diplomats stationed in Russia are about to return home or plan to leave the country. British Ambassador to Russia, Voffan, is currently in London and will discuss the arrest of British technicians with the government.</p>

<p>Ye Chucang Reports at the Central Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 72nd Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 8:00 a.m. on the 3rd. A total of more than 500 people attended, including Ye Chucang, Ma Chaojun, Jing Tingyi, Jiang Zuobin, Fu Rulin, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Zheng Zhannan, and staff members. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. Because Wu Chaoshu had left Nanjing, Ye was temporarily changed to give the report. The gist of the report was that the Standing Committee passed a motion last week to convene a provisional national congress in July and to advance the opening of the National Congress. The Central Government's decision to do so was not because it was in a difficult situation and sought a retreat, but because it was full of positive spirit and sought a solution. Therefore, the highest power organs of the party had to conduct immediate and detailed research and make a serious decision. In the future, not only can we strengthen the party's strength, but we can also enable the people to have a sound organization to express the public opinion and strength of the people, that is, all political powers and functions will have a unified standard and be convenient to apply. If everyone understands this point, they can know the positive spirit of the party. After the speech, the meeting was adjourned. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e243">George Bernard Shaw Warns Japan, Saying "Japan Destroys the League of Nations" <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The Japan English Chronicle published an interview with George Bernard Shaw on March 2, covering China, Japan, the League of Nations, and nationalism. An excerpt of it is as follows:</p>
<p>Shaw spoke about the League of Nations not long after he started to speak with irony. He answered the question of a certain reporter, "Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, do you agree with it? Is it good or bad that I agree with it? Japan has already made up its mind, has already destroyed the League of Nations, and has already proven the League of Nations to be completely useless. The League of Nations has two aspects, this is what you all know. One aspect is the secretariat where officials work, handling diplomatic events. The secretariat convenes meetings, votes on cases, and prepares reports, but no one has ever paid any attention. I have attended a meeting once, and I never want to participate in it again, because this kind of meeting is just a conversation to seek nothing."</p>
<p>The other aspect of the League of Nations activities, the International Labour Office, was praised by Shaw. He sketched out its organization, saying that it was a "very disorganized group" that had always done good work there before.</p>
<p>He continued, "But you have already overthrown that aspect, dismantled their arena."</p>
<p>"They should have taken some action when you first dealt with China and first broke the alliance, they should have severed ties with your alliance, without any scruples, but they did not take any action, and they never thought of taking any action, they instead sold arms to China and Japan, and they are still selling arms, you have provoked this war, you can not win by courage or Bushido, but by armaments, the ancient style of risking one's life and dying for honor has passed, and now the infantry charge will not be better than what I saw in 1914, when the infantry charge was just a ridiculous massacre, you are not like that, you are preparing to use armaments to defeat them (referring to the Chinese), and they must also prepare to use armaments to defeat you, as long as they can."</p>
<p>All Wars are Self-Defense</p>
<p>"You say everything is self-defense, you are fighting for self-defense, you must know that all wars are self-defense, your past actions have been very appropriate, because you have not declared war."</p>
<p>"But if the League of Nations intends to just do some official business, and if you only intend to let others abuse your power and do the work of slaughter and destruction, then what is the use of the League of Nations?"</p>
<p>"However, in the capacity of a third party, I am anxious to know whether you ask yourself, what is the benefit of what you have done for you? Now I am an Irishman, Ireland is a small vegetable garden of a country, with about four million residents, and England has forty million residents, but England wants to prevent the Irish from restoring their nationality, and will not succeed in the end, in order to suppress the Irish, they have also abused the policy of iron and blood, and carried out the means of burning and killing, the Irish leader Michael Collins, once said that for every milk shop that is destroyed, he must burn two suburban villas as revenge, have you considered this point? In 'Manchukuo,' there are 28 million Chinese, how do you plan to pacify them? You cannot handle this matter with the police, the police are useless no matter what, if the residents do not allow him to enter, it will be useless at all, the Chinese will certainly not do this, so you cannot avoid this current problem, that is, whether you are prepared to suppress them for the next few hundred years."</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw reminded the person who was visiting him that he was seventy years old, and when he was young, England had a kind of horse-drawn carriage, and sometimes the horse would slip and fall on the ground.</p>
<p>"What happens when a horse slips and falls? Why do everyone hurry to sit on the horse's head? It's nothing more than because if the horse struggles to stand up, it will definitely move the harness and the shaft, and the carriage may overturn." "Suppressing patriotism is like sitting on the horse's head, and there is no time to do other things, the Irish have made the British parliament unable to do anything but discuss the Irish issue for more than 30 years, this is a proof."</p>
<p>"If you have to spend the next hundred years riding the horse's head, then what will you encounter? Who is preparing to work there, or must this work be done? Nationalists or patriots will never come to do it, they are busy making speeches." Idiots Embracing Nationalism</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw interrupted with a little bit of discussion about nationalism when he spoke here.</p>
<p>"Any idiot can say the words of a nationalist, any idiot can talk about freedom and historical glory, since nationalism is easy, it can also be a big obstacle to the public, when you finally lay the foundation of your country, you will probably feel that you must shoot the nationalists as soon as possible, but at this moment, the work is stopped, have you really looked far away and investigated all of this? When conquering China, have you thought about what kind of situation Japan will become? Riots and intimidation will arise one after another, and you will eventually feel that peace is impossible unless every Chinese person, you send a policeman to monitor him."</p>
<p>While Mr. Shaw was giving this high-profile speech, the reporters' pencils stopped moving. Mr. Shaw may have noticed this, and not long after, he took the opportunity to say that he had passed his proper age and had reached a period in which everyone began to look at him and secretly said that he had lived to such an old age and was still ignorant of the times. "You must understand that I can ignore everything, if I were still only twenty years old, I would never speak bluntly."</p>
<p>The Meaning of Bushido</p>
<p>Someone corrected him and said, "There is also Bushido."</p>
<p>Okay, what is the meaning of Bushido, what is Bushido, is it what you call patriotism? A patriot is a person who makes himself and his country ridiculed and must probably be shot."</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw began to ask his own questions.</p>
<p>What religion do you believe in? Since you are newspaper reporters, you probably don't believe in religion, but... what religion do the people of... believe in? Are they Buddhists, or Shintoists, or other religions?"</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw is really a clear person.</p>
<p>"You must understand that I look at all kinds of religions together, I am very curious about religions, there is a part of truth in every religion, so I believe in all of them, but all religions have gone astray, such as the Buddhism here in your place, it is not real Buddhism, you are just setting up a statue of an Indian Shinto, to deceive the people and pray for blessings."</p>
<p>"What do I want to visit in Japan? There is nothing to see, I don't want to visit anything, I just came here by chance, I wanted to take a long trip, so I boarded this ship, I heard that this ship was going to this place, I came here without end, I am writing a play to comfort myself, writing a play is my career, just like the career of a shoemaker is sewing boots."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Shaw admits that he is curious about Japan's Kabuki-za, playhouses for performing songs and dances, and music, as long as Japanese dramas are not like the Chinese, who all hum the same unnatural tune.</p>
<p>At that time, several Beppu visitors arrived, and Mr. Shaw only said that he was very interested in his trip to North China, and that General Zhang Xueliang was an educated and refined person, completely unlike the warlord he had imagined before. After saying these two sentences, he ran away.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Newspaper Discusses America's Ambition Toward the South Seas Islands <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Mandate Territory from Japan</p>
<p>Planning to Ensure Air Control in the Pacific</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on March 27, the situation regarding the return of the South Seas Islands under Japanese mandate is becoming increasingly urgent worldwide. In addition to Japan and Germany having begun preparations for negotiations, the United States, due to Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, has expressed a tendency to intervene. The reason is that the South Seas issue is closely related to American Far East policy. Recently, the ambition of the U.S. Navy and Air Force to advance into the Far East has been fully exposed. In order to connect its fundamental routes, the US intends to secure the route across the South Pacific with the following locations: San Francisco, Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam Island, Philippines. By gaining control over this air route, this secures its military advance into the Far East. If the South Seas Islands in this air route were under Japan's control, the United States would feel uneasy about its advance into the East. Therefore, the US military has been trying hard to remove the South Seas Islands from Japan's control. At the same time, the United States incited the Southwest faction in China to start a war against Japan and established a naval aviation base in Guangdong. On the surface, the United States seems to be assisting the Southwest faction, but in reality, the United States is preparing for a war against Japan. In the event of a sudden crisis in the Pacific, Japan might seize the Philippines. Therefore, the US plans to cut off the connection between Japan and the Philippines and ensure an air base at the shortest distance from Japan. However, the only major obstacle to the implementation of naval air control in the Pacific is Japan's South Seas Mandate territory. For this reason, the United States, taking advantage of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, is seizing the opportunity to take the mandate territory from Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Opening of the Four-Province Farmers Bank <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Two Million Yuan in Savings Received on the First Day</p>
<p>Approximately 500,000 Auxiliary Currency Vouchers Issued</p>
<p>Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi Have Sent Personnel to Prepare for Establishing Branches</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence: The Four-Province Farmers Bank of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, after several months of preparation, with a capital of 10 million yuan, has been fully paid up to one-fourth. According to the regulations of the headquarters, it can be opened for business. All important staff members have already been announced a few days ago. The directors are Xu Fu, Jia Shiyi, Zhou Xingtang, Pu Zhengdong, Zhou Cangbai, Wang Zhengying, and Guo Waifeng. The supervisors are Ye Yu, Wen Qun, Li Jihong, and Mao Bingli. Guo Waifeng is the General Manager, Chen Huaizhong is the Assistant Manager, Jin Xueteng is the Director of the General Affairs Department, Guo Jian is the Director of the Business Department, Ling Jingshan is the Director of the Voucher Department, Ni Wenshuo is the Director of the Accounting Department, and Chen Jian is the Director of the Investigation Department. The internal arrangements were completed, and it officially opened for business on the first of this month. The flag was raised at 9:00 a.m., and Guo Waifeng opened the door, and then the business began. No ceremony was held. Many military and political figures went to congratulate. Also, whenever a bank opens, the industry has a tradition of "piling flowers", that is, sending deposits of cash. On that day, the bank received 1.93 million yuan in silver coins and 681,514 taels, 3 mace, and 9 fen of silver from the silver shops in the city, totaling more than 2 million yuan. In terms of business, the savings department received more than 300,000 yuan in savings deposits from various households. Auxiliary currency vouchers of 10 cents, 20 cents, and 50 cents were issued for more than 100,000 yuan. Approximately 500,000 yuan was transported to the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. At the beginning of business, the bank issued a declaration, stating the main purpose, saying "The four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi have suffered bandit disasters, and the rural economy has been completely destroyed. Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, Chiang [Kai-shek], is extremely concerned and believes that post-disaster reconstruction must be based on revitalizing the rural economy and promoting the improvement and progress of silkworm industry production, and especially establishing farmers' banks to provide farmers with funds as the foundation for rural revitalization. Our bank bears this important responsibility, and the management and planning are all carried out in accordance with this main purpose and actively carried out. Now, the head office has been established in Hunan Street, Special District Three, Hankou, and business has started today. Within the four provinces, branch offices and sub-branches will be established in sequence. We are saddened by the outflow of funds from our country, the rising cost of living, the destruction by bandits, and the withering of agriculture. The way to save the country and resist foreign aggression must rely on strengthening national strength. Our China is founded on agriculture, and farmers are the largest majority. The decline of farmers in the four provinces in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is related to the prosperity and decline of the national strength of the whole country. Our bank specializes in the business that farmers' banks should have and will do its best to assist farmers. However, the rural organizations in the four provinces are mostly unsound. Although cooperatives are being promoted, the actual number of those established is considerable, but in proportion to the number of households and population, it seems that it is not yet sufficient. Our bank and the rural cooperative have the relationship of auxiliary wheels. We especially hope that the authorities and enlightened people in the four provinces will fully promote the universal organization of cooperatives to assist our bank in order to achieve the effect of using funds. Our bank itself will also strive to promote sound progress gradually in order to live up to Chairman Chiang's hard work in creating and the ardent expectations of the people of the four provinces." It is heard that the bank has decided to establish branches in Anqing, Kaifeng, and Nanchang, and sub-branches in Jiujiang, Wuhu, and Zhengzhou. Ouyang Hancun has been sent to Nanchang to prepare first, and the staff preparing for Kaifeng and Anqing can also be appointed within a few days. (April 1)</p>
<h3 id="e246">Red Bandit Harassment in Southern Jiangxi, Xunwu <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Gangster Chief Gu Dacun of Eastern Guangdong Surrounded and Suppressed</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Red bandits in southern Jiangxi, surrounded on all sides by the National Army and facing difficulties in finding food, are fleeing in desperation, seeking to survive. In early March, a fake Independent 3rd Division and 10th Division, numbering about six or seven hundred, arrived at Xun Guan from Anyuan. They attacked the local militia in a village west of the county. Troops of the Yue Army's Ye Shou Regiment, stationed in Che, launched a two-pronged attack, routing the bandits, who retreated into Xunwu City. The bandits immediately gathered local people from the bandit areas near Xunwu City, forcibly organizing hundreds of them into spear and shield teams. On the fourth, they attacked Xiang Mountain, east of Xunwu, which is a very strategic location. The local militia, led by Pan Jin-di, had been stationed there with over a hundred men. For more than a year, the bandits had attacked many times, but all failed. That day, the bandits advanced from all sides, and after a fierce battle all day, the militia, outnumbered and without ammunition or reinforcements, was finally forced by Pan Jin-di to lead the men safely to Pingyuan County in Guangdong via the ridge of Xiang Mountain. At that time, one group of bandits, numbering about a hundred, detoured around the back of Xiang Mountain from Congkeng, pretending to be National Army reinforcements. The refugees fleeing Xiang Mountain fell for the ruse, and over four hundred were tied up in Duihe. All the clothing and luggage they had managed to carry out were looted. After the fall of Xiang Mountain, the villages and towns of Congkeng and Dazhong on the border of Fujian and Guangdong were successively raided by bandits. The villages of Huyang Xin Village on the Guangdong side and Pingyu Jiuguo on the Fujian side were robbed several times a day. The suffering was unprecedented. On the eleventh, after the bandits had plundered to their fill, they retreated to Jianxi, Cixi, and other places in Xunwu territory, leaving only a few Red Guards to guard Xiang Mountain. After this battle, the number of refugees on the Guangdong side increased even more.</p>
<p>Also, the gangster chief Gu Dacun of Eastern Guangdong Province is hiding in the mountains of Baxiang in Fengshun County. Chen Jitang had offered a reward of 20,000 yuan for Gu's capture, but so far he has not been found. Gu has a bodyguard of forty people, twenty-four Mauser pistols, two light machine guns, and five rifles. On the nineteenth, the military police stationed in Fengshun carried seven days' worth of dry rations and searched for him in Houyan and other places in Baxiang Mountain. Meixian also sent police to Ye Tian to encircle him. On the morning of the twenty-second, the First Company engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits below the stone wall of Daqiwei. Company Commander Yang Zikuan and Deputy Su Jiezhong bravely charged and fought hand-to-hand, killing the bandit squad leader Wu Yaliu, beheading him, and seizing a gun. Gu Dacun, wearing a military uniform, fled into the deep mountains. That day, the Second Battalion also launched a raid against the bandits from Jiulongzhang, killing more than ten bandits and beheading two. The bandits' arrogance has been slightly suppressed.</p>

<p>Selecting a Special Commissioner for Post-Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Assisting in County Administration Design</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The bandit suppression headquarters decided to establish Lihuang County in Jinjiazai, which belongs to Liu'an County in western Anhui. Forty-five wards were demarcated from Liu'an, Huoshan, and Huoqiu Counties in Anhui and Gushi County in Henan. Recently, the headquarters has confirmed that the county belongs to Anhui. The Anhui Civil Affairs Department submitted a request to the provincial government to appoint Yan Er'ai as the county magistrate of the county (Yan was appointed by the headquarters). On March 28, at the 180th meeting of the provincial government, the Civil Affairs Department proposed that a special commissioner be sent to the county to comfort the disaster-stricken people and to handle the design of the county administration. After discussion, it was decided to rename the Comfort Commissioner as a Special Commissioner for Post-Disaster Relief, and the main points of the design are as follows: (1) In order to establish the foundation of Lihuang County's administration, the provincial government will select a Special Commissioner for Post-Disaster Relief to work with the county magistrate to plan all reforms. (2) The Special Commissioner for Post-Disaster Relief will, in accordance with the following items, work with the county government to understand the actual local conditions and propose various implementation plans: 1. Matters concerning rural improvement and the livelihood of unemployed farmers; 2. Matters concerning various productions and production education; 3. Matters concerning the construction of highways and the establishment of telecommunications bureaus; 4. Matters concerning the division of regions and the establishment of district offices for compiling and checking the baojia household registration. (3) The design period is limited to two months. (4) This outline will be abolished after the design is completed. (5) This outline will be implemented after being decided by the government committees (March 30).</p>
<h3 id="e248">Issues Concerning the Sino-German Joint Steel Plant <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Explores the Coal Reserves of Leijia Gou</p>
<p>The Location of the Plant is Still Unresolved</p>
<p>The total capital of the Sino-German joint steel plant was originally set at 80 million yuan. However, due to the outbreak of the war, Minister Chen Gongbo, considering that it would be difficult to raise 40 million yuan, decided with the German Xiwang Company to reduce the capital to 50 million yuan, which would still be borne jointly by both parties. The current Ministry of Industry has sent technicians to Leijia Gou to explore the coal reserves there and will conduct a detailed test to determine whether the coal quality is suitable for smelting steel. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Reducing Loans <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>When the Ministry of Industry and the German Xiwang Company were proceeding with the joint steel plant, the total capital was originally set at 80 million yuan, with each party raising 40 million yuan. However, the 40 million yuan to be borne by the Xiwang Company could be offset by a portion of the machinery. Therefore, the German side expressed considerable support for this proposal from the Ministry of Industry. However, due to various reasons, the formal contract has not yet been signed. After the outbreak of the war, central finances were inevitably affected. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, considering that it would be difficult to raise 40 million yuan in cash, repeatedly consulted with representatives of the Xiwang Company on the proposal to reduce the capital of the steel plant. Finally, it was decided to reduce it from 80 million yuan to 50 million yuan, which would still be borne jointly by both parties, and a draft agreement was signed to proceed with the exploration of the Leijia Gou coal mine.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Exploring Coal Mines <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>At the suggestion of Minister Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry, the best location for the plant would be either in Ma'anshan or Leijia Gou, because the coal reserves in these two places are abundant. However, the German representatives strongly advocated locating it in Zhaojiagou, fifteen li from Pukou. However, the Ministry of Industry did not agree because of national defense considerations. After repeated discussions, the German representatives finally agreed to first explore the coal reserves in Leijia Gou and test the quality of the coal produced to determine whether it could be used for smelting steel in order to determine whether it was suitable for construction. The Ministry of Industry has now sent technicians to Leijia Gou to arrange for exploration. As for whether the coal quality is suitable, it will be decided after a detailed test by the German representatives of the contract.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Predicting Plant Location <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>As for the location of the steel plant, although the German representatives no longer insist on locating it in Zhaojiagou, they have not yet made a definite decision on Leijia Gou and Ma'anshan. According to news from our side, the Ministry of Industry believes that if the above two locations are still not suitable for building a steel plant, it will send personnel to the upper reaches of Hankou to find a new location. However, this proposal must be discussed with the German representatives after the coal quality test of Leijia Gou.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Northeast Association has focused on planning the activities of righteous armies within the three provinces. Recently, underground righteous armies in the eastern parts of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces have been launching attacks, disrupting the defenses of the Japanese and puppet troops. However, due to the fact that the spring screening season has not yet begun, there is no safe cover, so the date for a large-scale uprising will have to wait until May or June. The first executive council meeting will be held tomorrow at 4:00 PM to discuss association affairs and the solicitation of members, and work will begin after the meeting.</p>

<p>The First Batch of Over Two Thousand Tons Arrived in Port Yesterday</p>
<p>Five Thousand Tons Will Continue to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Northeast region is the most abundant forest area in our country, with annual exports of over 70 million yuan. Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the forests in the Northeast have also been seized by the Japanese, and the Karafuto Timber Company has been officially established to manage all export affairs. Recently, due to the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, Soviet timber exports to China have been increasing rapidly. The Shanghai representative of the Japanese Karafuto Company, in order to compete for sales, telegraphed the company to quickly arrange for the shipment of large quantities of timber to Shanghai in order to meet market demand. Therefore, when the Japanese ship Shengjing Maru sailed from Dalian to Shanghai yesterday, it carried over two thousand five hundred tons of timber, and another five thousand tons will continue to arrive in port tomorrow. According to Japanese merchants, the Chinese timber market will be dominated by Japan and Russia in the future, but the Soviet Union will inevitably fail because the transportation of timber from the Northeast to China is faster than from the Soviet Union, and the lower prices are a fatal blow to Russian merchants.</p>

In addition, Zhu Hexiang, Director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was sent to Nanyang to inspect the conditions of various consulates, has completed his mission and arrived in Shanghai on the same ship as the delegation to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing. However, as of 3:15 PM today, the telegram from the ship has not yet arrived at the wharf.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Sino-German Aviation to Conduct Test Flight Next Month <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>New Aircraft Will Fly from Germany to Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Sino-German air traffic, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Li Jingzong, manager of the Eurasia Aviation Company, this morning at the company. According to him, plans for Eurasia air traffic have been in the works for a long time, but have not been realized due to various reasons. A telegram from Berlin recently stated that the Sino-German air traffic test flight is scheduled for May 1. However, according to what this person knows, in order to develop the aviation industry, Eurasia Aviation Company previously ordered five aircraft from Germany. Two aircraft have been shipped to Shanghai by sea and are being assembled. The remaining three aircraft are scheduled to fly from Germany to Shanghai via Russia in May for the first Sino-German air traffic test flight. The Sino-German route is 9,000 kilometers long, so it will take six days to arrive. After the aircraft arrives in Shanghai for a test flight, the test flight results will be studied before a decision is made on the date of the air traffic. As for the Northwest route, it has already been opened to Dihua. However, the section from Dihua to Tacheng is sparsely populated and there are very few passengers, so it may be difficult to realize in the short term.</p>

<p>Planning Air Traffic Between the US and China</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation is a Sino-US joint venture, with the Chinese side holding 55% of the shares and the US side holding 45%. Now, all of the US shares have been sold to United Airlines in the US. Representatives from United Airlines have also arrived in Shanghai recently to formally negotiate, and the deal should be completed soon. However, this move has nothing to do with the Chinese shares, as it is a transfer procedure outside the company. However, it is said that United Airlines has plans for direct air traffic between the US and China.</p>

<h3 id="e260">Umbrella Industry Workers Petition <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>To Visit the Social Affairs Bureau Today</p>
<p>Demanding a Livelihood</p>
<p>Recently, over twenty companies in the city's umbrella industry, including Huanqiu, have organized a joint business office, forcing various factories to join, causing eleven companies, including Hualishi, to suspend operations. Workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau this morning. The various suspended factories plan to submit the bylaws of the business office to the Party and government for their opinions. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Workers' Petition) This morning, the workers of the various suspended factories each sent a representative, including Hua Lishi Gongshi He, Xin Dalu Lu Amei, Da Youyu Sun Shida, Zhixin Chen Junyi, Fengli Zhu Wanhe, Tailai Wang Tongfa, Dongnan Min Liangcai, Nanchang Lu Yiming, Ruilin Cao Renqing, Sanyuan Cai Dehuai, Ming Huasen Yao Cancheng, and others, totaling eleven people, to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, demanding that the factories be ordered to resume operations in order to maintain the workers' livelihoods. They were received by Wang Xianqing of the Third Section, who promised to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and then convene a mediation.</p>
<p>(The Capitalists' Opinions) According to Zhu Chunbo, manager of Hualishi, the organization of the National Goods Umbrella Trade Joint Business Office by over twenty factories, including Minhua 1233 Factory, Huanqiu, Nanhua, Yingfeng, Huadong, Minghua, Xintai Long, Dahua, Xin Dahua, etc., is, on the surface, to promote national goods, which is something that should be done in the current era. However, the various factories that have suspended operations cannot sympathize with the methods and bylaws that have been set. For example, Article 3 of the bylaws states that the output of each factory joining the office shall not exceed the reported number per day, but when market demand increases or decreases, it can be adjusted proportionally by the office. Article 6 stipulates that six jiao per dozen of goods will be deducted from the price paid to each factory as operating expenses. Article 7 stipulates that factories joining the office shall not sell privately, and if discovered, a fine of 200 yuan per dan will be imposed, and retail sales must be made through the office. All profits belong to the interests of the business office. It should be known that after deducting various expenses, each factory only profits two jiao per dozen umbrellas, so adding expenses will only result in losses, and there are no profits to be made. There is no choice but to suspend operations, which is a result of being oppressed. We only hope for the workers' understanding and plan to submit these unfair bylaws to the Party and government for adjudication.</p>

<p>Petition for Mediation to Prevent Escalation of Unrest</p>
<p>Party and Government Reportedly Sent Personnel to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>The French-owned Qiuxin Shipyard in Shanghai's South City has over three hundred workers. Recently, Ren Wenxing, the foreman of the planer shop, colluded with Westerners to hire private individuals and dismiss three old workers, Sun Jiayue, Chen Mingjin, and Dai Renyang, causing opposition from workers in all departments of the factory. This morning, the planer shop went on strike (it is not accurate that the entire factory went on strike, as seven departments including the coppersmiths, carpenters, single-bed founders, ironworks, cold workers, and small workers did not participate). The Qiuxin Workers' Union of the First District Shipyard Industry sent Guan Rongqing and Wang Ronggen to the Party and government this morning to petition. Zhang Sheng of the Municipal Party Headquarters received them and promised to handle the matter together with the Social Affairs Bureau. Wang Xianqing of the Social Affairs Bureau received them and immediately went to investigate the truth.</p>

<p>Martyred in Action Against the Japanese at Gubeikou</p>
<p>The Sichuan Kai County Alumni Association of Students from Beijing and Shanghai held a meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM at the Shanghai Lawyers Association, located at the intersection of Baylor Road and Lafayette Road in the French Concession, to mourn Wang Runbo, the head of the regiment who was martyred in the war of resistance against Japan. Many people attended. After the meeting began as scheduled, Chairman Wei Anzhi reported that the martyr graduated from the third term of the Huangpu Military Academy, dedicated himself to the revolution, and always possessed a spirit of sacrifice. He was the current regimental commander of the 149th Regiment of the 25th Division of the National Army. This time, he fought against the Japanese at Gubeikou, leading by example and sacrificing himself. His loyalty and bravery are exemplary. He also gave a speech, calling out slogans such as "The spirit of the martyrs will not die." The meeting adjourned. The eulogy is attached below: "On April 3, 22nd year of the Republic of China, the fellow provincials from Kai County who are traveling to Beijing and Shanghai, with fresh flowers, clear fruit, and sincere hearts, pay tribute to the portrait of the regimental commander Wang Runbo, the martyr who died in the war of resistance against Japan, and mourn with the following words: Alas, the violence of Japan's invasion has lasted for half a lifetime. They forcibly occupied the eastern provinces and attacked Shanghai. Their ambition has not ended, and the flames of the invaders are even more fierce. They advanced into Rehe, plundered and raped without restraint, destroying the remnants of justice and peace. We hate our superiors who did not resist at all, abandoned their posts and fled, leading the invaders into the hall. The fall of Chengde made Tianjin and Beijing panic. Outside the Great Wall, the bandit's power was like a frenzy. They wanted to destroy us and dominate the East. Only our martyr, disregarding his own safety, led the troops north, defending Gubeikou, launching a great crusade, and being the bravest of the three armies, discouraging the enemy's courage. He charged and fought in close combat in the bloody battlefield. The isolated army fought hard, but it was difficult to last for long. The enemy outnumbered us, and you died in battle. Alas, martyr, your spirit is magnificent. Wrapped in horse hide, a man's ambition is strong. Your great achievements will be passed down for generations, achieving benevolence and taking righteousness, shaking up cowards and awakening the foolish. The death of the martyr is the light of the nation. Alas, please accept our offerings."</p>
<h3 id="e275">Procedures for Transferring Opium Offenders from Nantong <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Yao Zichun Temporarily Detained</p>
<p>Awaiting Evidence Before Transfer</p>
<p>Regarding the government's policy of banning opium through taxation, Jiangsu Province has also established a Narcotics Investigation Bureau under provincial orders, with branches in various counties specifically for investigation and enforcement. Nantong serves as the fifth branch. Locally, the trafficking of narcotics has seen red pills surpass opium in sales, and the profits are even greater. Consequently, a large-scale red pill manufacturing operation was established locally and flourished greatly. Since the establishment of the fifth branch, this operation has been deemed illegal and harmful to society, even more so than opium. Therefore, the facility was sealed off last month, and fifteen key offenders were arrested and sent back to Zhenjiang, where they were detained at the Narcotics Investigation Bureau. The director has repeatedly interrogated them to uncover accomplices. Recently, an old offender confessed that Yao Zichun from Xiamen, Fujian, was one of the masterminds behind the manufacturing operation. However, Yao had already fled to Shanghai during the arrests and was hiding in the concessions, evading the law. In addition to sending a formal letter to the First Special District Court of Shanghai requesting extradition, the Narcotics Investigation Bureau also instructed investigator Fan Mingfu to come to Shanghai to track down Yao. Yesterday, it was discovered that Yao was hiding at 25 Changfeng Lane on Tongban Road. The investigators immediately contacted the Xinzha Police Station, requesting additional detectives to raid the address and arrest Yao. This morning, Yao was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Hua Yugui conducted a preliminary hearing. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated that according to the agreement, any extradition request must be accompanied by substantial evidence. This case only relies on an official letter, which seems insufficient to prove criminal suspicion. Since it is claimed that Yao was implicated by an accomplice's confession, the authorities should be ordered to produce that confession before extradition can be granted. Judge Liu briefly questioned Yao and ordered his temporary detention, pending the Narcotics Investigation Bureau's submission of evidence for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e276">170 Pounds of Opium <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Discovered by Detectives on Jichang Road</p>
<p>Sun Caiyuan Claims Friend Entrusted Him</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:40 AM, Ding Baoxiang, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, detectives Mu Chunrong, Indian constables Nos. 341 and 146, and Chinese constable No. 1825 of Santoudu, saw several people on Jichang Road loading two leather suitcases and two baskets into car No. 17885, which was parked there. Suspecting their behavior, they moved forward to arrest them. A Ningbo man named Sun Caiyuan was apprehended on the spot. Upon opening the suitcases and baskets, they found opium weighing a total of 170 pounds, worth over fifty dollars. The car driver, a local named Shen Fulin, was also taken into custody. This morning, Xiao Xiexun, a judge from the First Special District Court, accompanied by prosecutor Ren Zuzhe, conducted an interrogation at the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, presented the facts and stated that Sun Caiyuan confessed at the police station that Chen Jinshan, a friend working at the Ruhe Wheel office in Hankou, had asked him to wait at the dock and receive items to be carried and collect payments, but he was unaware that they were opium. According to Sun, Chen Jinshan is from Hankou, tall and thin with a long face. Shen Fulin, the driver, stated that the person who hired the car spoke with a Ningbo accent and was fat. The two testimonies did not match, and a request was made for an extension for further investigation. The opium was then presented for inspection. Constables Nos. 341 (Indian) and 1825 (Chinese) testified that there were many people present at the time of the arrest and that the others had left in Chen Yi's car. Questioned about this, Sun Caiyuan stated that the opium did not belong to him and that he was there to collect payment from Chen Jinshan, a Sanbei native, and was mistakenly arrested. He retained lawyer Ge Zhaoji to represent him. However, Chinese constable No. 1825 stated that Sun Caiyuan was already in the car at the time of the arrest. Shen Fulin stated that he worked as a driver for the Zhejiang Automobile Company at 739 Zhejiang Road. A man in Western attire came to hire the car. This person had a yellow complexion, a stout build, and spoke with a Ningbo accent. He told him to drive to the location and wait, then got out of the car and boarded the ship. After a while, two laborers dressed in blue cloth brought the leather suitcases, etc., and he did not know they were opium. He asked for consideration. Judge Xiao ordered their continued detention, with a rescheduled hearing in seven days.</p>

<h3 id="e277">China Will Not Perish <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Since the unfortunate confrontation in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, China's national destiny has been constantly facing setbacks, incurring financial losses and substantial population decline almost every year. The year before last was particularly disastrous, plunging thirty million compatriots into misery and turning the beautiful landscape of 3.8 million square miles into a scene of desolation. The insatiably greedy Japanese aggressors are now using aircraft, bombs, cannons, tanks, and other weapons of war in Rehe, actively committing inhumane acts of slaughter. Faced with such trials and emotions, the Chinese people are deeply saddened and worried about the imminent demise of their nation.</p>
<p>However, the principle of "heaven's justice prevails" and "good fortune follows extreme adversity" suggests that as China's national destiny has deteriorated to its nadir, it may be the turning point for a prosperous future.</p>
<p>In terms of divine will, the imperialist executioners, warlords, and financial magnates of Japan are constantly being assassinated. The Japanese Emperor himself was once alarmed. Although the traitor Zheng Xiaoxu survived an assassination attempt, the sudden death of his beloved son Zheng Chui, the puppet mayor of Changchun, may be divine retribution. The heroic generals Ma, Su, Feng, and Li, who have been fighting hard in Northeast China for years, have safely escaped, which may be due to divine protection. Furthermore, the monk Quan He has donated one hundred thousand "divinely blessed yellow bags." It is unknown what kind of divine courage the soldiers at the front will have when they wear these bags.</p>
<p>In terms of popular sentiment, people of all backgrounds in the country aspire to "love the country," discuss "saving the nation," hear about "sharing national difficulties," and witness "resistance articles." Even the merchants, who were previously hesitant and unreliable in boycotting enemy goods, have now issued a notice stating that "daily necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, except for the 'unavoidable,' should all be Chinese goods." Furthermore, inspiring slogans such as "long-term resistance" and "sacrificing family fortunes to relieve national distress" are widely supported by both military and civilians.</p>
<p>In terms of geographical advantages, China is vast in territory and rich in resources, blessed by nature. The winding Great Wall can temporarily prevent the southward advance of the invading army, and the river and sea mouths are heavily fortified to prevent enemy ships from easily entering. Stepping back, if necessary, the tactic of "attacking from high ground" can be adopted by relocating the entire nation to the Pamir Plateau and establishing the headquarters on the highest peak of Mount Everest, thus avoiding enemy aircraft. When the enemy attempts to attack uphill, they can be repelled by simply throwing down rocks and wood, causing them to tumble and retreat in disarray.</p>
<p>In terms of military affairs, the national army consists of two million troops, who have gained abundant combat experience through years of actual combat practice. Therefore, reviewing the history of anti-Japanese battles since the September 18th Incident, there is not a single record of "defeat," which is indeed significant. Just as the French dictionary does not contain the word "difficult," China's war history will henceforth be free of the word "defeat," creating a magnificent echo between East and West.</p>
<p>From this, it can be concluded that "China will not perish" is a certainty. If we continue to abandon the right to complacency and indulge in unnecessary worries, we would not only be foolish but also undermine the national character of a great nation. How can we allow that? How can we allow that?</p>

<h3 id="e280">Swine Epilepsy <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am a clerk in a pharmacy, and I am nineteen years old this year. When I was seventeen years old, by the command of my parents and the words of a matchmaker, I was engaged to the daughter of XX. I originally wanted to marry her formally next year; however, unfortunately, something happened: she now has a terrible disease, and when it attacks, it is as if she is dead. I am very dissatisfied with this, and I am very worried. I am now asking the Sir for guidance. I want to break off the relationship with her. Her illness will make it impossible to maintain a family in the future, and it will hinder my future. Therefore, I am determined to break off with her. Is it possible to achieve my goal legally? Her illness is commonly called "swine epilepsy." She did not have this illness at first; it was only recently noticed. When I found out, I relayed the matter to the matchmaker and negotiated to break off the engagement. Unexpectedly, they refused and said that this was my misfortune and that I absolutely could not break off the engagement. I think marriage is a serious matter and should not be misunderstood. I am in this kind of environment, and I am very worried. What should I do? Editor Sir, do you have a good plan? Please do not hesitate to guide me! I wish you good health. Written by Yao Shangqing.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Swine epilepsy is indeed an incurable disease; although we should pity those who suffer from it, we should not marry them. Because this can ruin our happiness and absolutely cannot reduce their suffering. Mr. Yao should insist on breaking off the engagement. The law stipulates that "if the other party has a serious incurable disease," the engagement can be dissolved. As for the fact that she contracted the disease after the engagement, it is also not a problem and can be applied. We must know that if she already had this disease before the engagement and did not explain it at the time of the engagement, Mr. Yao can now not only request the termination of the engagement but also demand compensation for damages!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This almost made Wu Yi immediately dismiss his intention and leave, but then he thought that it was not easy to have such a high-ranking friend, so he should not offend him and ruin his future.</p>
<p>"Qianli,... Mister Zhao,..." Zhao Qianli had changed his title, and Wu Yi had to change his as well. "Director Zhao, I am very ashamed that I have not achieved anything yet. To be honest, this trip to Beijing to visit you is of course..."</p>
<p>"Of course, you want to find a job here!" The cunning Zhao Qianli had already anticipated Wu Yi's intention when he received his card. "Haha! We are old friends! If you are willing to help, there is no reason not to welcome you, but, but you studied education, and what is needed here is finance!"</p>
<p>"But, Director, I think if you can give me a job as a secretary, it doesn't seem necessary to know accounting; I probably can..." Wu Yi honestly and politely stated his needs.</p>
<p>"Secretary, that is of course very good. Unfortunately, ... unfortunately, ..." Zhao Qianli did not expect that he would actually open his mouth directly, so he tilted his head and pretended to be very difficult. "Unfortunately, we only have three here, the three old ones; I cannot change them for the time being, because...!"</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, a servant in a white bamboo cloth uniform suddenly pushed the door open and said:</p>
<p>"Director, Secretary Liu has arrived, especially to thank you for the appointment!"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute! Get out! I have a guest here!" This powerful refutation made even Director Zhao, who knew no shame, blush half of his old face, and he had to give the ignorant servant a fierce look.</p>
<p>The situation was already deadlocked. Zhao Qianli suddenly woke up and thought that Wu Yi was, after all, a terrible newspaper editor. For the sake of his own fame and fortune, he should not offend him too much, so he immediately changed his face.</p>
<p>"But we are old friends after all. You have traveled thousands of miles to come to me, how can I disappoint you too much? Then, ... then, ..." As he spoke, he picked up a salary schedule for employees from his desk and quickly flipped through it. "Then, I will appoint you as a tax collector! The monthly salary is one hundred and twenty yuan, but you don't have to go to work. You can go back to Shanghai, and I will remit the money to you every month..."</p>
<p>Originally, Wu Yi also knew that there was a set of flexible methods in the Chinese officialdom, such as supporting concubines and younger brothers-in-law, but he never expected that Zhao Qianli was also such a bastard who used state funds for personal gifts.</p>
<p>"Specialized talents, or accounting technical talents, that is, people with business experience, are very much needed..."</p>
<p>"Finance," "accounting," "specialized," "technical," these steel-hard special nouns almost scared Wu Yi. He had to turn his head and face to the left, not daring to look him directly in the eye. On the left was a huge bookshelf, filled with foreign books, three or four inches thick, with leather covers and gold letters. Nineteen were the great works of the world's major psychologists. Although Wu Yi had also studied psychology, at this time, he could not help but suspect that the psychology that Zhao Qianli studied in the United States was perhaps a special kind of psychology that could replace finance; otherwise, he believed that since Zhao Qianli himself was not a financial expert, no matter how absurd it was, he would not use these special nouns of "finance," "accounting," "specialized," and "technical" to embarrass others again.</p>

<h3 id="e282">The Autumn Waves of Movie Stars <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Qin</p>
<p>A person's personality and behavior can be guessed from their eyes, right into their heart. If they have a kind personality, their eyes will always have a kind and gentle expression. If they have a vicious personality, their eyes will reveal a fierce light. At the same time, a woman's bright eyes can fully express beauty. The so-called "a glance of autumn waves is enough to captivate the soul." If we examine the eyes of movie stars, we can find certain styles in their bright eyes, which is quite interesting. Joan Crawford is a famous big-eyed sister. Of course, there is no need to mention her eyes are large. Joan Crawford's big eyes, frankly speaking, slightly hinder the beauty of her face, but her big eyes are full of energy. She has achieved her energetic and lively style because of these big eyes. In "Grand Hotel" and "Rain", her brilliance lies in her two big eyes, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>In contrast to Joan Crawford is Norma Shearer. Norma Shearer's eyes are particularly small. Her pupils are large and often set high under her upper eyelids, so at a glance, you know she is a careful and restrained young lady, giving a sense of awe and respect. Her style is revealed in the middle without reservation.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's eyes are very deep and sad. When she plays tragic and charming characters, she can give people a lot of sympathy. Her gentle autumn waves, like a pool of spring water, can make people intoxicated and immersed in them.</p>
<p>"It" Girl Clara Bow's eyes show full of heat, and have the taste of strong and unruly. The space between her upper eyelids and eyebrows is extremely close, which is a characteristic of strong and unruly.</p>
<p>Jeanette Loring's eyes show a lot of gentleness and pleasantness. Her style is petite and exquisite, infinitely lovely, all in the gentleness.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich's eyes are sharp and transparent, so her style tends to be mysterious and unpredictable, requiring speculation behind the scenes and finding the meaning beyond the words.</p>
<p>Tallulah Bankhead's eyes are flirtatious and moving, her style can be dazzling and soul-stirring, making people drunk.</p>
<p>Constance Bennett's eyes show a clumsy and strong attitude, so she always depicts the indomitable and strong style.</p>
<p>Having said a lot, there are still many that you can speculate on yourself. You can guess the inner heart from the eyes, and you will never guess wrong.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e283">Review of "Love on the Spot" <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Yesterday I watched "Love on the Spot" at the Carlton Theatre, and I suddenly thought of "Of Human Bondage" which I saw two months ago. Indeed, this "Love on the Spot" is adapted from a novel, but it has the same effect as "Of Human Bondage", and there are some similarities in the story and skills.</p>
<p>The story is like this: In a hotel, there lives a young man who is a pickpocket with extraordinary skills. After three thefts, the detective suspected him, but could not find any evidence. At that time, another girl and her father also lived in this hotel. The father and daughter are both swindlers wearing gentleman masks. But the girl fell in love with the young man, and she frankly stated that she would change her ways in the future. The young man was also moved, returned all the stolen goods, and the two walked together on the right path.</p>
<p>The actors are very unfamiliar to us. The young man who plays the thief is Rickad Dolman, and he shows all the attitudes of British youth. His natural facial expressions, singing and dancing, are very pleasing. Maybe it can be considered that he has the charm of viewing Fullei? His liveliness and humor make people extremely satisfied. Especially he is extremely suitable for the role in the play. The girl is played by Rosemary Ames, which is generally good. She is very beautiful, but her expressions are a little worse. The songs she sings are very nice. Her father is played by Anbrey Mather, who specializes in making jokes, which can make people laugh.</p>
<p>The old woman who was stolen, Helen Ferrers, occupies an extremely important position in the supporting roles. Her performance vividly describes the general arrogant aristocratic lady, which is very relevant. As for the child John Singer, he is very promising, and in this film, he has shown great acting talent.</p>
<p>There is not too much dialogue. If you can understand every sentence, then you can find countless humorous materials to make you laugh.</p>
<p>As for the director, he can only be regarded as above average. The angle and position of the photography are good. The lighting is also worth watching. From the costumes and scenery, you can tell that it is a British film, with a noble continental color in the beauty. Of course, the attitude of each actor is also related. The editing is all good. As for the big swimming that is used to attract, the girls in the swimming pool, and the filming of the camera, although they copied the old tricks of the stage dance troupe, they still do not lose their novelty, but it is a pity that it is too short and there are too few changes. All four songs are "Jazz Songs", which can be said to be a "good" word.</p>
<p>In all song and dance films, the soundtrack is often supposed to be very good. But the music of this film is very ordinary and does not inspire people's excitement.</p>
<p>The plot is very superficial, but it still has some satirical and teasing meaning. (For example, searching Aixi from the head of a sixty-year-old man)</p>
<p>In short, this film can give you pleasure and make you laugh. Although, it cannot call you to remember it forever.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Big Nose Mockery <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>In Hollywood, even children know that when you say Mr. Big Nose, you are referring to Jimmy Durante, whose fame entirely comes from his nose. Since he has such an enviable big nose, many people have created a song to mock him, which roughly means:</p>
<p>The face powder of the girls in Los Angeles can be smelled on the top of Mount Piferlei; in the summer, it can really be used as a sunshade, so that three children can hide underneath to enjoy the cool; but the wind inside is too hot, it is better to go to the beach to enjoy the cool!</p>
<p>Ah! It's hateful why I don't also have such a thing, so I can make big money in Hollywood?</p>
<p>This is a Chinese actress who grew up in Hollywood. Her name is Xia Li Malisha. She was introduced in Si Yingjun's "A Stateless Woman" in this publication on March 6.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Quick News Roundup <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>The Tianyi Company's new film "Vitality" is now more than halfway through filming, starring Chen Yumei and Yuan Meiyun. The previous rumor included Hu Shan, but she has long since been replaced.</p>
<p>The Nanyang Company's production "Platinum Dragon" is adapted from a Cantonese opera, so two-thirds of the dialogue is in Cantonese. The rest is a mix of Shanghainese and Mandarin. Apart from the three actors who are from Nanyang Company, the rest of the cast and crew are entirely from Tianyi Company, it is said.</p>
<p>Since Gai Jiaotian stopped performing at the Qitian Stage, he has been actively engaged in the film industry, inviting Peking opera celebrities such as Yuan Yuelou to participate. The originally planned name was "Gai Jiaotian Film Company," but now, adopting a shareholder system, it has been changed to "Qiankun Film Company." However, it is being conducted in secret, so very few people know about it.</p>
<p>Recently, the various studios of the Lianhua Company have been actively producing various short films, mostly of the news and slapstick variety. Five sets have already been filmed and will be released soon. This is likely a good sign for the future of domestic films, it is said.</p>
<p>Ma Xuwibang, famous for his makeup artistry, was once hailed as the "Thousand-Faced Man of the Orient" five years ago. There are rumors that he may join Tianyi Company, but negotiations have not yet been finalized.</p>
<h3 id="e286">The Strange State of Cinemas <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Peng</p>
<p>Cinemas are places of refined entertainment, and going to the cinema is about appreciating the merits of performances on the screen. However, some patrons' purpose is not to watch the performances on the screen, but to admire the faces and clothing of the beautiful women in the theater.</p>
<p>Many women often dress flamboyantly, douse themselves in perfume, and deliberately flaunt their charms in the cinema, hoping to attract the attention of the opposite sex, exchanging glances with men, acting out love stories as if they were on the screen. Has the refined cinema become a public matchmaking agency for romance? The music in many cinemas is also full of tricks, with the music played having nothing to do with the meaning of the film. Most careless patrons are content as long as the music continues uninterrupted. If it stops even for a moment, they will start making a fuss. When the music is playing, they often stomp their feet incessantly, causing headaches.</p>
<h3 id="e287">"Wu Song" to Shoot on Location in Suzhou <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Songfu</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian Film Company's first film, "Wu Song," has been in preparation for a long time. Gai Jiaotian initially wanted to shoot the exterior scenes in Hangzhou. However, because he has other business in Suzhou recently and cannot get away, he has decided to shoot in Suzhou. Filming is expected to be completed in about a month, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Odds and Ends <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingzhi</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong's "Tears of Blood in Rehe," filmed at great risk in the Northeast, has been fully edited. It was screened in Beijing and received a good reception. It is planned to be released at the Beijing Grand Theatre soon, it is said. Star Company's change of style, "Rouge Market," is being rushed to completion and will be released at the Carlton soon.</p>
<p>Amidst the clamor for "National Salvation Through Aviation," the film industry is unwilling to be left behind. Lianhua Company is preparing to conduct a fundraising performance. The script and cast for this performance include major stars such as Jin Yan, Ruan Lingyu, Zheng Junli, and Chen Yanyan. At the same time, all Lianhua's basic staff will be present. It is also said that the tentative title of the play is "Resistance," written by Jin Yan.</p>

<p>— Huijun</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I thought you had fainted and that's why I held you!" he said, and Maggie's face turned red. "I have never fainted," she retorted.</p>
<p>The boy seemed to be developing an affection for her. "Women are all timid, I bet you're afraid of mice too!" he teased.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid of nothing!" An angry flame flashed in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Another ride?" the boy suggested, as the roller coaster stopped at the station.</p>
<p>"Never again!" she gasped, but seeing his mocking expression, she hesitated, forgetting that the car was about to leave.</p>
<p>Like lightning, the roller coaster sped along the track again, his arm around her again, and she, unable to resist, closed her eyes, leaning powderly against his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Having fun?" he asked. Maggie nodded shyly. As he helped her out of the car and through the tunnel to the ground,</p>
<p>"What's your name?" He told her his name was! No, don't tell me, let me guess. Helen... no! Patty... no! Maggie... that's it! Maggie." She learned that his heart's desire was called Pantuo, and that his profession was a journalist. They talked, laughed, went to drink soda, and went on the Ferris wheel together. Maggie was so happy. Ah, the State Fair is so interesting she's glad she came! She felt that tonight was the most real and lovely night of her life. But now it's over again quickly over! But, looking at Pantuo's earnest, loving attitude, she knew there was still tomorrow!</p>
<p>Tonight, Huien also felt a mysterious freshness. He stood near the large platform, waiting, knowing that this was the place for aerial performances. Suddenly, the drums thumped loudly, and the host announced; "Please watch Ms. Hogan's performance she is the world's number one triple hanging artist!" Before Huien's skeptical eyes, a slender figure, wearing a tight-fitting costume, ran out, bowed, and climbed the ropes. Ah, it was Emily!</p>
<p>His mouth was half-open, barely daring to breathe, watching until the end of the performance. She came down from the ropes, seemingly looking for him among the gathered audience, and then, in his direction, threw a blown kiss. A long sigh came from his lips. Finally, he decided to walk towards the backstage door with the sign "No Admittance." There, he moistened his dry lips, waiting until Emily, in plain clothes, came out happily to greet him.
