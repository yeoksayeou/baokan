<h3>廢除苛捐雜稅之呼聲（英）</h3>
<p>最近汪院長以行政院農村復興委員會委員長名義。通電全國各省市縣各人民團體。將各該地方各種捐稅名目額數。詳細報告。俾便整理彚集。詳加查核。並召集各關係機關。切議廢除整理之法。庶民困得以稍蘇。民力得以漸裕。當此全會經濟衰落内憂外患交相煎迫之日。而政府當局能察及民生困苦之根原。謀所以廢除此擾民最甚之苛捐雜稅。誠爲吾人这所樂。聞惟此廢除苛捐雜稅之政策。本爲我政府立國之至計。曾經政府頒布明令施行。其後如清黨以前設立改良捐稅委員會。此伐完成時下令廢除山東之苛捐雜稅可見政府與民列始之意。固不自今日始。然而數年以來。全國各地之苛捐雜稅。較之民十五以前。名目尤爲繁多。擾民亦更較甚。此果由於辦理困難。奉令者施行不力耶。抑國家多故内亂迭起而有所不睱也。論者謂今日我國家山河破碎。社會不安。都市農村。俱無生氣。綜其最大癓結。全由於外國經濟勢力之侵略有以致之。故政府當局而誠欲挽救民生。當先致力乎此。然吾謂廢除此苛雜之捐稅。正所以增我國民抵抗外來侵略勢力之力量。故廢除苛捐雜稅。宜以堅决誠確之態度。迅速施行。若必須先之以詳確調查。繼之以整理審核。然後召集開會從容討論。竊恐夜長夢多。又將因延宕而等於泡影也。</p>
<p>夫今日之所謂苛捐雜稅。課稅名目與貨物種類。旣隨地百異。竹木有稅。雞鴨有稅。而課稅之機關。又多架牀疊屋。省中徴之。縣府徴之。鎭市徴之。駐軍亦徴之。累民之深。可謂已極。誠不能不加以極詳細之調查。惟此種捐稅最後之担負究其實際。多仍在於全國一般窮苦無告之細民。而於城鄉少數有閒者流。依然無與也。納稅人爲消費者之自身無論矣。但大部分之納稅人。皆屬諸販賣營生之商人。收買原料之工主。與夫經營地田之富人。事實上皆可以所納之稅金。全部轉嫁於消費者之身。而一般消費者唯有忍氣呑聲任其榨取而已。彼商富等萬一價格不能過事高抬。亦少有賠本之禍。卽因苛捐雜稅之牽累。而有妨礙其經營發達。亦猶屬今日社會經濟諸種問題中之次焉者耳。由是以言。苛捐雜稅之爲患於社會人民。如此重大。廢除寗可稍緩耶。今當局倡言與民更始。不以苛捐雜稅關係於地方當局重要財源之故。而憚言改革。不可謂非細民之幸。惟望政府當局能鼓其勇氣。一力辦成。勿徒以空言市惠。仍如以前之徒令後人追思。則庶乎其可矣。</p>

<p>羅斯福新宣言</p>
<p>不抱拓展領土野心</p>
<p>反對任何武力干涉</p>
<p>願努力與國聯合作</p>
<p>增進世界民族福利</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　本日係前總統威爾遜生辰、羅斯福總統特在「威爾遜基金」董事會發表關於美國外交之重要演說、略謂此後美國永不侵略他人土地、其對於干涉拉丁美洲各國之舉、亦所反對、旋稱贊國務卿赫爾在汎美洲大會所獲成績、謂戰爭乃各國執政者所釀成、而非人民所願爲、前總統威爾遜對於世界各民族之互相了解、多所盡力、威氏曾宣言云、美國不復觎覬他國寸尺之土地、此種宣言、美國已奉爲圭臬、威氏宣言更有重於此者、當其向拉丁美洲各國表示意見之時、又云人類自由、未便因物質利益而加以剥削、歐戰影響所及、此種坦白政策未能盡其功用、殊爲可惜、時至今日、余敢以總統資格、於威爾遜宣言之外發表一項新宣言、聲明此後美國政策、反對任何武力干涉「他國立憲政府必須予以維持一層、美國並不擔負義務、美洲大陸其他國家若發生混亂、其影響及於全洲、不僅及於一國、」此次烏拉圭京城汎美洲大會所以成績斐然者、正因美洲各國對此理論均能了解、且了解之者不僅各國當局、卽各國人民亦能深明此義也、此際美洲各民族之思想至爲佳善、淺見者流以爲威爾遜各項計畫、業已失敗、此種謬誤見解、起源於民衆之國家思想、但威脅和平之咎、當歸諸各國當局、而不當諉之各國人民、羅氏繼云「威爾遜爲廢止戰争、向全世界所作呼籲、各國民衆聞之莫不色喜、惟一九一九年聚集巴黎商訂和平條約之政治家或自稱爲政治家者、多視威氏申請爲具文、務以國家政治利益私人威望、與國家展拓領土爲念、國聯會乃於此種不良之空氣中、呱呱墮地、所幸國聯會成立以來已多所裨補、世界各國遇有爭端、莫不直接或間接依賴之、以覓求較爲良善之解决方法、多數外交談判均由國聯會畀以機會促使進行、關於衛生·商務·敎育·各項事業、制成方案、國聯會亦有所盡力、而大小各國之間遇有爭執、無論大小尤多賴以平息、美國與國聯會公開合作、在目下尤較任何時期爲甚、國聯會係世界和平之棟樑、吾美雖非會員國、亦不欲加入國聯會、但該會努力爲全世界各民族保障生命、增進福利、美國必以全力與之合作」、羅斯福旋謂、全世界人民中、百分之十威脅他人、而爲其百分之九十所懼、羅氏又追述國聯會向世界各國所提各項建議、其中以普遍裁軍及放棄武力侵略爲最要、至此乃作結論云、「凡此種種仁愛之建議、均不幸而失敗、各國政治首領聚集於日内瓦者、乃以可笑之理由自文其過、此輩雖以人民名義發言、却不足以代表人民、予敢對引輩進一言曰、假如世界各國人民能直接發言、則全世界共維和平之妥恊、可立卽告成、一九一四年之戰以及前此歷史上之戰、皆爲各國政府所釀成、與人民固無與也、吾人敢以威爾遜之言敬告當世、其言維何、卽自今以往各國執政者不許釀成戰爭、而由各國人民逕自樹立和平是也一、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>古巴良好印象</h3>
<p>哈伐那　昨日故威爾遜總統誕日、羅斯福總統發表演說、再三申明不干涉他國事務之政策、此項演說、對於古巴政府頗有熱烈之印象、桑瑪旦總統頃發表宣言稱頌羅斯福、並謂古巴政府與人民對於羅斯福總統所稱「武裝干涉爲糾紛根源、且足引起各國互相逐鹿」之語、完全表示同意云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>莫洛諾夫說明蘇俄國際地位</h3>
<p>切實宣稱蘇俄志在和平</p>
<p>但亦準備應付被攻危險</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯中央執行委員會昨日開會、人民委員會主席莫洛托夫在熱烈鼓掌聲中報告一九三四年發展蘇聯國民經濟之計劃、在該項報告結束部分、莫氏述及蘇聯之國際地位云、</p>
<h3>美俄携手外交最大成功</h3>
<p>「一九三三年爲蘇聯國際地位更形鞏固之年頭、事實類已爲彼等自身申述矣、蘇美復交爲蘇聯外交政策最大之成功、此事動機出於羅斯福、此固爲週知者、蘇聯政府當卽接收此項動機、於是兩最大國家間邦交之人爲障碍、（此種障碍之存在、吾人不能尸其咎）、最後乃告消滅、而美國國民予李維諾夫以熱烈之歡迎、卽已表示此項復交對於蘇聯與美國之本質之要求、以及深切之願望已滿足至何種程度、蘇美外交關係之建立、乃以一項恊定爲基礎、此項恊定全與蘇聨外交政策之原則相符合、邦交旣經建立、則貿易與經濟關係之發展、自更能順利進行」、</p>
<h3>政策中心爲和平而奮鬭</h3>
<p>莫氏力稱、「在現時國際局面下、尤爲重要者卽此種關係之確立、對於國際關係之隱定、以及世界和平之鞏固、必有巨大而有利之影響、關於此點、吾人必須認清蘇聯政府所堅决履行之外交政策、已獲得重要之成功、在過去與現在爲世界和平而奮鬭之問題、乃亦吾人注意之中心、此種爭取和平之奮鬭、以及爲對新起帝國主義戰爭之奮鬭、必能適應不僅爲蘇聯且爲其他各國人民最深切之願望、吾人對此絶無疑義、蘇聯政府在此努力促成新起帝國主義戰爭之分子在國際關係中日益增長之際、在此種事態由軍備與軍事預算熱狂增長之際、在此凖備新起戰爭之工作在衆人眼前在多處進行之際、仍能用種種方法加强其爭取和平之奮鬭、雖有若干國家之統治集團方日事推進其侵略之企圖、亦所不顧、」</p>
<h3>無西顧憂互締不侵犯約</h3>
<p>莫氏續謂、「蘇聯外交在本年内已獲得重要之勝利、蘇聯之外交已光榮的完成下列任務、卽公開並堅决暴露侵略的帝國主義勢力、以清晰之建議反對彼等、並贬詆若輩圖以武裝從事解决國際糾紛之作爲、諸君試追憶吾人在軍縮大會中曾向列國建議締結反對侵略國之公約、以反對掀引戰爭之分子、人固週知軍縮大會對此問題之遲延不决、並未阻難吾人與若干鄰國卽波蘭·芬蘭·愛沙尼亞·拉脫維亞·立陶宛·羅馬尼亞·捷克·土耳其·波斯·及阿富汗等國訂立侵略國定義之公約、此等蘇聯外交之勝利、乃與李維諾夫之英名固結不解、李氏之功績固爲一般所熟知、惟予必欲在此特别申述、（長時之鼓掌聲）予料全塲聽衆必能歡迎下述之建議、卽李維諾夫在此關於國際政府之問題應作一更詳細之報告、（鼓掌）</p>
<h3>意法波土維持友誼合作</h3>
<p>莫氏續云、「蘇聯政府在與列國之關係中、已堅决履行其歷經測騐之和平原則、以及切實恊作之政策、此事最顯明之實例、當爲吾人與土耳其之關係、土國十週紀念時、蘇聯政府以伏洛希羅夫爲首之代表團曾蒞土國、同時此友好之國家對此代表團復於萬分熱烈之歡迎、此等事實已足表現蘇土邦交之穩定其政治的意義、此際予當述及蘇聯與波蘭間商務與文化關係之發展、已獲得嶄新而較前有利之條件、吾人對此無論過去與現在均賦與巨大之政治意義、蘇聯與法蘭西間之切實合作已順利開展、法國要員之來蘇聯、以及兩國代表建立更密切而帶商業性之接觸、更使此項合作易於發展、吾人以爲蘇法合作進放一新階段、且將來必有良好結果、最後吾人與意大利已訂立不侵犯中立及友誼公約、同時以西班牙與烏拉圭之動議、吾人已於彼等建立外交關係、此數者亦爲蘇聯與他國發展邦交之顯例也、</p>
<h3>一度惡化對英邦交好轉</h3>
<p>反之、吾人與英國之邦交、本年内曾有短期之惡化、蘇聯政府以明顯之理由、不能同意於以外力壓迫我内政之政策、同時在此事件内能始終保持其地位、此項惡化起因於維克公司破壞者一案之審判、不久亦卽消滅、現時則已在倫敦進行正常之商務談判矣、</p>
<h3>保障和平對政策不變</h3>
<p>蘇德邦交在我國國際關係中恒占特殊地位、蘇聯矢志於保障世界和平與我國獨立之原則對於德國自無變更政策之理由、惟德國之統治者於本年内則已屢圖改變其與蘇聯之關係、明白人自不難看取此種傾向也、此際吾人不必詳述盧森堡胡根堡及其他人員所作之聲明、口頭筆頭對此國已充分述及、有一事得爲吾人清楚鑒及者、卽直至最近蘇聯與德國之友誼、又落着於相互要求和平與發展經濟關係之基礎之上、卽在今日吾人仍絶對矢志於此等原則、吾人以爲只有奉行此等原則、乃能搆成蘇德兩國政治與經濟之合作、以及企求世界和平之合作之力量也、唯好戰之國家社會主義思想領袖如盧森堡等則反是、彼等之政策全爲反動之欲望、以及帝國主義者之掠奪計劃所滲透、故每蘇聯鞏固及誼一舉絶不相容、吾人並以爲此項政策與德國偉大之將來亦不相容、</p>
<h3>日本狡譎不足與言親善</h3>
<p>至於吾人與日本之關係、則已言之綦詳、蘇聯政府關於此點之政策、對於蘇聯以外之勢動者亦已瞭然、吾人最初要求締結不侵犯公約、允予出售中束路、並以誠懇之態度應付各項商業問題、如日本在遠東之特權問題等、此等事實固爲衆人所熟知、同時無人能向吾人要求、對於吾人和平之企圖、提出更大之證據、然凡此均未能阻止若干日本報紙及日本官員每日造作各種汚穢謠傳、盛稱蘇聯有侵略之企圖、第一日彼等發出一項消息謂、蘇聯政治警察襲擊滿洲邊界、第二日則謂莫斯科派人在中國組織反日運動等等、彼等每日發出更多之謠言、此種行動之目的、無非在掩飾、彼等代理人之反蘇聯、衝突反蘇聯挑釁耳、日本最反動之軍人鑒於自身日趨孤立、故對於蘇聯美國與中國間成立相當之合作、以對付在遠東啓釁之分子一舉特别憂懼、彼等自己對於此種合作之可能過甚其辭、同時對於彼等自造之謠傳、作慌張之否認、而暴露其自身、彼等對於蘇聯之巨大成長、異常畏懼、同時失其自信、而以更形頑固之態度聲稱「此其時矣」以上所陳均足表現平等對於戰爭和侵略之危險、實未能漠不相關、現時復有此種必要以陳述此事對於吾人之意義乎？吾人於此所必需聲述者、類已道及、吾人之任務乃在不屈不撓、繼續履行在遠東之和平政策、並改善吾人與日本之關係、同時吾人必須充分凖備、以應付可能的襲紛擾、就目下而論、吾人誠不幸猶未能保證必能避免此種襲擊與紛擾也、</p>
<h3>脫退國聯德日用意各殊</h3>
<p>所謂新起戰爭之危險在本年特别確實之說、得以下述事實證之、德國與日本俱已核准脫退國聯、德國之出此一着、顯與其欲擴張軍備有關、彼以參加國聯爲擴張軍備障礙之一、而日本在知照國際說明其脫退行動時、則表示其欲保持其干涉中國之完全自由、卽如國聯在某種限度内、亦放縱干涉主義者行動之自由、唯在此亦須承認國聯對於窮兵黷武之勢力、具有某種阻難作用、實爲有利之事實、脫退國聯之理由、無論如何不同、吾人所須考慮者厥爲下述事實、卽此等重要事件絶不能有助於世界和平之鞏固、反之、彼等能放縱最爲反動與侵略之力量、故吾人必須更堅决的更有系統的保障和平、同時利用現時種種機會、暴露種種促成新帝國主義戰爭及對於蘇聯之新起侵略行動之企圖、</p>
<h3>集合農工力量促醒帝國迷夢</h3>
<p>吾人最切要之任務、乃將蘇聯在現時資本主義環境中之眞實地位告知勞動羣衆、故應將足以威脅和平之基本事實、以及足以增進吾人之和平政策與世界和平之事實、正確告知工農大衆、資本主義國家之統治階級從未且永不能將各該國家之實際地位及各該政府之實際外交政策告知其國民、此事在現時反動的法西斯營壘中之紳士自更難辦到、彼等正縈迴於帝國主義掠取之迷夢、故彼等最後必堅持將頭可斷、此項政策不可行之態度也、唯有工農羣衆最高擁護之蘇聯政府乃深信、開展羣衆對於和平之有意識的態度、乃其最大之任務與義務、此際卽吾人最大力量之所在也、當工農了解彼等奮鬥之目的何在、彼等果何所爲而努力而犧牲時、則彼等自絶不畏難、而成不可抗之力量矣、（熱烈鼓掌）吾儕布爾希維克之以絶不遊移之信仰奮勇前進者、亦卽以此、（熱烈鼓掌）（廿九日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>史丹林談日俄邦交危機</h3>
<p>親善非單獨所能成功</p>
<p>日不改態度徒自召禍</p>
<p>（紐約）　今日紐約時報載蘇俄史丹林與其莫斯科通訊員談話、謂史丹林已明白宣稱日本爲蘇聨之眞正危險、史氏之言曰、余認日本若企圖於此際進攻蘇聯、將爲最不智事、但吾國必須凖備於萬一、我人欲與日人有友好關係、不幸此非吾國單方面所能成功、倘日本能有較合理份子得勢、作較審愼之建議、則兩國將能和好並立、第恐日本之軍閥或將迫令較清醒之政策退避三舍耳、所以目下正有嚴重之危險、吾人不能不凖備應付之云云、此外史氏又表示蘇聯將贊助國聯之維護世界和平、並欲與他國增進貿易關係、至關於美俄復交一事、史氏謂渠銷貨市塲、亦凖備訂購大宗外貨而償付其貨價、蘇俄此時之償付貨價、固人人所驚異、但蘇俄力能償付、渠固知今日到處不償債務、但他國或將愆付債務、蘇俄則不愆付、蘇俄黃金之藴藏甚富、採掘之量日增、現已採得一萬萬盧布以上、超過帝俄時代產金一倍云云、按史丹林向來寡言、尤不常接見外國新聞記者、故此項談話、極爲美人所注意、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>天津海軍醫院事件解决經過</h3>
<p>劉瑞恒在平津交涉</p>
<p>與法方商定新恊約</p>
<p>關於北洋海軍醫校醫院事件、最近行政院派劉瑞恒赴平津、會同外交海軍兩部代表、與法使法領恊商結果、將前張學良所簽恊約取消、另定新約、據劉瑞恒發表關於此案之談話如次、</p>
<p>「天津北洋海軍醫校醫院、創設於前清、迄今已五十三年、其地址係在當時官地之内、庚子亂後、法國根據條約、開闢租界、該校院適在界内、因係官地、法方曾認爲係租界所有、後經交涉、提有條件、如聘用法籍敎員等、并有每年須繳租金銀一兩之說、遂仍繼續辦理、民國以來、轉歸海軍部管轄、近六七年來、因經費無着、積欠華法敎員薪水甚多、醫校早經停辦、醫院亦破壞不堪、今年春間、北平軍分會張學良氏、因籌軍費與法方接洽、擬將其地基出售、法方擬變價後須扣除開闢馬路及各項欠欵捐欵等、故所餘亦不甚多、但此合同已於二十二年二月十五日由張代表與法領簽字、此項消息傳出、各方以此地產、不應由軍分會處分、且多年之校院、經此取消、羣起反對、四月中、行政院對於此事、决議恢復該校院、政府將備欵認欠、從新建築、繼續辦理、遂由外海兩部、派遣代表赴津、與法領交涉、取消該約、法領對於取消恊約一層、延宕推諉、又復多日、本月九日、行政院令派本人前赴平津、會同外交海軍兩部代表、解决此事、本人抵津後、與法使韋禮敦·法領麗畢思·晤商、經一星期之交涉、至十七日、新約起草完竣、本人卽電行政院報告、是晚七時簽約、新約内容要點、爲劃定二十四畝歸北洋海軍醫校醫院爲興復之用、十五畝爲開闢新馬路及供給養路費用等之用、中國政府擔任償還法籍敎員欠薪、至華籍敎員欠薪、另由中法兩方、用換文處理、合同全文、業經本届行政院會議核准、并决議關於復興醫院校設籌備委員會、由内財敎海四部組織、計劃辦理、法籍敎員欠薪、由法庚欵撥付、華籍敎員欠薪、交敎財兩部辦理、此事現可告一段落、對於交涉經過、尙有須補述者、第一、合同所訂大綱、均經行政院會議於事前决定、第二、法方原提擬由地畝折價償還法籍敎員欠薪、暨捐助巴斯德化騐室欵項等條件、均已除外、第三、在事實上、已無較善結果之可能、爭議至此、已盡心力、本人對於華籍敎員欠薪、極爲注意、已照換文提出行政院會議、現院議交敎財兩部、自有着落、可期清償、復興醫校院之事、甚爲緊要、當由籌委會趕速組織辦理、深盼早日觀成也、」</p>
<h3>贛皖湘鄂視察記（本報特派員任安）</h3>
<p>社會舊制一度摧毁</p>
<p>租佃條件日趨寛和</p>
<p>霍山通信、霍山赤禍、四年有奇、地土經界、屢經倡議破除、卒未成爲事實、當其瓜分土地、搗毁地主豪紳住屋、反對宗祠設備、破除迷信、打倒社會種種舊制度、農民初感不慣、頗欲逃亡、但以赤菲及各級僞蘇府組織嚴密、防範週至、無法遂願、日久遂亦相安、其不肖者其且爲虎作倀、予國軍進剿以種種不便、皖西殘匪、不易肅清、卽以此故、其分田制度、係以生產量爲標凖、赤匪·赤匪家屬·僞蘇府政治工作人員、先擇肥而噬、然後遞及其他、得田以後、須有受徴發及服役各種工作之義務、徴發多寡、恒以收穫豐歉爲增减、普通月約納糧一升、以供赤匪、地主及受罰富農、雖至流爲乞丐、但其每日所得物品、若超過其日需生活數量時、不待徴發、卽須繳銷、否則以歛財私蓄、怙惡不悛論罪、對於一般貧小農工、認爲成分最好之分子、言行均較自由、偶有錯悮、亦多寛恕、若富農或知識分子違法、則皆重處不貸、</p>
<p>僞蘇府組織、村爲單位、設主席一人、亦稱村長、村上爲鄉、設土地·勞働·經濟·文化·糧食·等委員五人或七人、區縣組織、亦與鄉同、惟縣分設各種委員會外、尙有政治保衛局、局設革命法庭、專辦審判反對赤匪之案件、局在離城七八十里之諸佛鎭、直屬僞西北道區委會、權柄甚大、民十九前、所入赤黨之分子、亦卽初在各村領導暴動之青年、至去年均有腐化嫌疑、竟以改組派·ＡＢ團·反動派·之罪名、判處死刑、無慮數千、而匪共失敗之最大原因、亦卽此次自相殘殺之所由起、該鎭所遺萬人墳一處、卽葬此次被殺之屍體、血蹟斑斑、白骨壘壘、亦云慘矣、該地赤禍之爆發、初因一般青年、受北伐影響、無不努力於黨務活動、而對農村作普遍宣傳、其中心口號、僅爲「二五减租」、取消「　雞」「醬麥」及「新米」（此均當地佃户對地主除納租外、照例應送之禮品、卽除夕送雞曰「　雞」、夏令或冬令、地主做醬、卽往送麥麥曰「醬麥」、新穀將熟、選折垂穗、焙乾碾米、送請地主嘗新曰「新米」、數量多少、以地主寛刻而分）、「租穀須地主自運」等、農民平時納租太重、且須遠近必送、已早蓄有敢怨不敢言之積憤、聞此口號、不免有動於中、漸向地主提出抗議、地主豪紳、遂深嫉此輩宣傳青年、並將彼等驅匿四鄉、遂爲赤匪利用、秘密工作、卒釀巨禍、坑殺異已、聞死者最大多數、卽此輩首倡暴動之人、</p>
<p>國軍四次圍勦、赤匪自相殺伐外、一方面又加緊編組童子團·赤衛隊·婦女慰勞隊·等、每將天倫樂叙之農家、立成勞燕分飛之殘窠、尤其鼓勵壯丁當匪軍、更易引起春閨之不滿、有所謂「牧羊歌」者、詞爲「我夫革命本是眞、革命兩三春、鬧散一家人、夫在南、妻在北、二人兩淚分、」句雖俚淺、但極風行、亦可見當時匪區人民骨肉分離、私衷憤懣之一斑、但匪共格於情勢、殊不示弱、亦爲歌云、「我妻不必把心耽、目下雖困難、團體總要講、我旣來、你也幹、情義兩不傷、」尙有二歌、一爲「白軍才是眞土匪、跟着土劣亂殺揮、亂七和八糟、耀武還揚威、我們工農個個都吃虧、」係用以譭謗國軍、並有儆工農自覺自决之意、一爲「寡婦年紀輕、一心要嫁人、娘婆二家、没有說明、山後有一人、他本年紀輕、我也合他心、手裏無錢娶不成、來到大路邊、兩眼淚不乾、抬頭看見共黨員、黨員說的好、平等女、親自找、找一個好男子、會種田、也會騎馬和坐轎、」此乃勸年輕寡婦、自動擇夫而嫁、此外尙有許多採茶調及兒謠、惟不如上三歌流行之盛、給人印象之深、雖自新年餘之農夫農婦、尙多能笑而誦之、惟聞尙有緊要句、未敢誦出、</p>
<p>目前社會狀况、據該縣縣長所談、已日臻安靖、民間訴訟、十數日僅有一案、類多與「摸瓜」有關、緊鄰立煌縣之西北鄉、近連發生數暗殺案、均係地方紳士、如保甲長等頭首、忽被截去、且無法破獲、一般富商、尤戰戰兢兢、暗帶烟膏、以防不幸被綁、便圖自盡、此因該鄉一則防立煌縣殘匪時有來擾之虞、二則自首自新之民衆、桀傲不馴、偶然故技復癢、或因地主報復前仇、亦易引起暗殺情事發生、東南鄉則有眞正之土匪、搶刧客商、鉅細不遺、有時且與小股赤匪作戰、蓋欲互繳槍械也、</p>
<p>霍山敎育、嚮不發達、識字人數、不如六安遠甚、赤化時、曾辦列寗小學數百所、收復之初、軍隊改辦短期義務小學及感化院、廣羅自首自新分子、施以特種敎育、成績斐然、方期再改正式小學、樂育數萬學齡兒童、詎料各校院僅辦一期、卽戞然而止、現城内祇有公私小學二三所、四鄉則概付闕如、縣府迭令籌辦、仍以經費無着、漠然視之、惟風俗簡樸、烟禍亦輕、社會經濟、不難恢復、縣府公務員、服裝整潔、遵守辦公時間、富有服務精神、殊有足多者、</p>
<p>田地價值、數年以前、每石漲至三百元、下等者亦二百左右、承佃時、佃户向業主所繳「寄莊錢」（卽押租）、每石田多至五六十元、租稞普通約占對成强、且時有換佃之虞、自經赤禍後、地價已約跌百元、寄莊錢更跌至十餘元、租稞亦酌减輕、佃年較長、若退佃、則大多提自佃方、若提自業主、除照還寄莊錢外、且須略給津貼、全縣農民成分、自耕農暨半自耕農、各占百分之二十、佃農占百分之六十、自耕農耕田面積占百分之十五、佃農耕田面積占百分之八十五、豐年僅足食、常年荒年、須仰六安舒城之輸入、</p>
<p>物產茶爲大宗、年產日萬餘斤、值洋二十餘萬元、有所謂松蘿茶者、香氣馥郁、與吳之虎邱、同負盛名、次爲竹木、年產三十餘萬株、值洋五萬餘元、茯苓一千餘担、值二萬餘元、掃帚二十餘萬捆、值七萬餘元、</p>
<p>全境大股匪徒、確已削平、惟零星散匪、仍不時搶家刦舍、騷擾閭閻、保安隊只有四排、殊難遍處防守、縣府特制定聯村防匪大綱二十條、令發各區保長遵照辦理、辦法略爲每保每日、各派出壯丁十人、編爲警察隊、輪流訓練、并於下午五時、集合担任巡邏·放哨·偵查·搜捕·及一切警戒事宜、一日量換、免誤農時、更番輪轉、以免偏勞、巡邏須擊木梆、以與他保梆聲相應、若遇匪警、連放土槍二聲、以求援助、聞推行以來、摸瓜案件、風鶴之恐、始日告减少、</p>

<h3>中國航空公司發展全國民航計劃</h3>
<p>本年完成三大幹綫</p>
<p>培植國内航空人材</p>
<p>申時社本埠訊、中國航空公司、自滬平滬蓉滬粤三大幹綫先後完成後、最近又着手開闢西南航綫、如試航結果良好、卽將正式開航、申時社記者昨訪中國航空公司總經理戴思基氏、叩以將來對於中國民用航空發展計劃、當蒙詳告、各情採誌如次、</p>
<p>三大幹綫完成　據戴氏談、中航公司開辦、已經三載、在此三年中、完全致力於三大航綫之完成、滬平綫於本年一月十日開航、渝蓉綫於本年十一月十一日開航、滬粤綫於本年十月二十四日開航、從此南北東西得相貫通、爲本公司第一期發展之成功、</p>
<p>本年業務概况　至公司營業狀况、以去年十二月份、與今年同月相較、去年客票收入爲二萬餘元、今年已增加一倍、約在四萬餘元、郵件方面、去年爲四萬餘元、今年增至七萬餘元、亦有長足進展、並將二十二年一月至十一月底、各項統計見示、計（一）乘客人數計二三四九人、（二）所載郵件爲四０·七六七公斤、（三）飛行英里數目爲五七一·九一二、</p>
<p>培植航空人材　戴氏繼談、本公司初辦時、因國内人材缺乏、多僱用外籍人員、今則國人亦有能勝任者、現無綫電及飛機修理師、均已聘任國人擔任、中美合同之存在期間、僅爲十年、培植航空人材、殊爲不容稍緩本公司對此、已加以積極注意、</p>
<p>擴充機塲設備　龍華機塲、原定建築跑道二條、一條業已完工、第二條亦興工多時、日内卽可完成、此種新式機廠、國内尙屬僅有、明春更將建築新棚廠、以臻完備、</p>
<p>發展西南航綫　戴氏最後談、此次實行西南試航、係應西南交通上之需要、同時雲南省政府亦表贊同、因而本公司卽積極籌備、原定於前日由漢試飛、因長沙一帶霧重、未能如期起飛、昨復陰雨、仍未飛行、一俟試飛成功後、卽可定期開航云、</p>

<h3>東瓜山觸礁之毓濟脫險將回</h3>
<p>不日可望到申</p>
<p>損失實屬不貲</p>
<p>毓大公司之毓濟輪、自温州洋東瓜山觸礁後、卽經公司與聯保保險行、會派三江輪、並載工程師器具材料等駛往救護、施工多日、昨得電訊、該輪已脫險、不久卽開回上海、亟將情形分誌如下、</p>
<p>修補破洞　毓濟輪觸樵之處、係在頭二兩艙、其撞破之處、經三江輪載去之水鬼入海檢騐、僅有破洞兩個、而面積不大、易於修補、遂由同往之工程師、用水泥木板橡皮等、臨時將船底破洞兩個、設法塡修補好、幸機器艙與後船艙、均無損壞、故易於救護、</p>
<p>貨物抛棄　一二兩艙、當時浸水至一丈五尺、而裝在艙中之水菓、亦皆潰爛損壞、輪局與保險行爲進行救船工作、决議將該兩艙之損壞貨物、實行抛棄、客客爲此事、曾與保貨之保險公司磋商、茲悉一二艙損壞貨已起出、連日由運去之工人、用帮布抽去兩艙積水、使船體浮起海面、然後乘潮開離淺灘、</p>
<p>船身脫險　毓濟輪自觸礁至今、已達十二天之久、昨日本埠該公司得訊、毓濟輪之救護工作、已經畢事、預計本日可以從東瓜山淺灘開出、船内引擎機器、均皆完好、該輪從淺灘駛出、擬就近往温州之瑞安暫停、以便檢視輪體、愼重航行、然後再駛來上海也、船内三四艙貨物、尙無毁壞、</p>
<p>來滬大修　據公司中人言、毓濟輪在此三天中、可以開到上海、抵滬後卸清貨件、再行入塢大修、此次該輪之觸礁、其原因大致由於船主開駛時、改行内圈路線、至東瓜山海面、風浪巨大、致彼逼至礁石而碰觸、幸旅客船員均無損害、船身亦得脫險、然遲誤航程、毁損貨品派輪營救、雇用技工等種種損失、亦屬不貲矣、</p>
<h3>國際貿易局昨召蛋商會議</h3>
<p>討論對付法國增加蛋稅方針</p>
<p>議决請財部减輕蛋品出口稅</p>
<p>國際貿易局奉實業部訓令、以法國增加蛋品進口執照稅、並限制輸入數量、此舉對於吾國蛋業影響頗鉅、飭令該局召集本市蛋商、討論補救辦法、爰於昨日下午三時、召集各蛋商在該局會議室會議、計到茂昌利寰等代表十餘人、議决各項應付辦法、茲將會議詳情、分誌於後、</p>
<p>到會代表　昨日到代表鄭吉英、（利寰）石英克·林海勁·陳清琤·（中央冷藏廠）潘有年·王理荃·王錫蕃·（錫記）鄭源興·（茂昌）崔亮功·（蛋業公會）曼菜·（培記）鮑司汀·麥叟·沙勃·當由季澤晋主席、</p>
<p>主席報告　行禮如儀後、旋由主席報告略謂、我國蛋品出口地位、極爲重要、一九三０年占第三位、一九三一年占第四位、一九三二年復占第三位、輸往法國者占蛋品出口百分之四、以冰治蛋品爲最多、鮮蛋極少、計一九一二年輸往一五·０二七担、一九二二年爲二一·八八四担、一九三二年爲三三·０五七担、出口數目逐漸增加、但一九三三年第四季、法國限我國輸往數量一四二噸半、合二三九四担、照此推算、每年約九·五七六担、與我國歷年輸往之數、懸殊過甚、此次法國加徴冰治蛋進口執照稅、每凈公斤爲四佛郎六十生丁、幾達值百抽百、與鮮蛋稅（每凈公斤收一佛郎五十生丁）比較、則鮮蛋稅僅及冰治蛋品三分之一、此次修改輸入限止數量、以各國購買法國貨物爲標凖、加徴冰治蛋稅、直接與中國輸出貿易打擊、間接影響農村經濟、各國提倡養鷄事業、蛋產漸能自給、均採用關稅保護政策、增加蛋品進口稅及限止輸入數量云云、</p>
<p>議决各案　昨日蛋商除提議下列三點外、尙有冰蛋業及蛋業公會、將另開會、將意見呈國際貿易局轉實業部施行、（一）（對抗方法）法國對於吾國輸出蛋品增加進口稅及限制我國輸往數量、請求我政府以對抗方法、增加法國貨物輸入中國之進口稅、或以相當數量以限制之、（二）（相等貨物交換方法）法國貨物之輸入我國、大都均屬化妝及消耗、本輕利重、而我國輸入法國貨物、均屬原料或農產品、本重利輕、倘法國以增加我國輸入之農產品加稅、而我國僅加該國輸入之消耗品、則兩相比較、利害懸殊、故我國宜以相當物品增加稅率爲原則、（三）請求實業部咨財政部、减輕蛋品出口稅、以鬆蛋商負担、</p>
<p>實部訓令　國際貿易局接實業部訓令、其原文云、准外交部咨、據法使館呈、爲請政府加徴冰蛋品進口執照稅、並修改輸入限制數量、咨行查核辦理等由、並附抄送法國輸入冰治蛋品商會原函、及法國農產物輸入表各一份到部、查閱附送原函、係請求設法與法政府交涉、提高限制數量、並恊助交涉酌减冰蛋品進口執照稅、此案法政府係對各國一律施行、本同一原則分配、惟法政府改徴冰治蛋品之進口執照稅、幾達一百抽一百、以與鮮蛋執照稅相比、則鮮蛋僅及冰蛋三分之一、而我國輸往法國者、以冰蛋品爲最多、鮮蛋極少、故此次改徴執照稅、於吾國蛋品輸出業實最不利、按上年份我國蛋品輸法數量原僅占蛋品出口總額百分之四、茲法政府又加重執照稅、並將修改輸入限制數量、我國蛋業亟須改良品質、减輕成本及改善推銷方法、以求發展、除分咨外交財政兩部會商外、合行抄發來咨及原附各件、並法商會來函譯文、暨本部咨外交財政兩部文件一件、仰卽妥爲籌劃補救方案、、並召集蛋商詳細討論、簽且意見、一併呈復、以憑核辦、</p>

<p>附近、先將該大木船四面包圍、旋卽一擁上船、突施逮捕、詎該海盜等見警士侯本貴等分投逃逸、料必回去報警、而官警亦必前來兜勦、故卽換乘一滿裝火油之船、直向吳淞口外開駛逃逸、迨朱總隊長等躍上木船時、已無海盜影踪、所有者、僅係木植一船、及該船船老大林杏中、船夥苗三桃·林念三·馮阿賓·等四名、並海盜等臨逃時遺下之步槍三支、子彈五十五粒、</p>

<p>會同偵查　是案發生地點、因適在越界築路之内、故靜安寺捕房捕頭、於前日下午、派華副探長范德孚前往出事地點查勘、時適唐翎班亦前往該處、遂會同向該處亞細亞加油站之司務王寳成探詢、始悉綁匪所用之汽車、似係黑牌號碼四零零、下一字已記不清楚、</p>
<p>破案線索　捕房遂根據此四零零一號至十號偵查、惟有四零零三號車主、係住居靜安寺路一七九八號本地人沈關泉、職業開車、恐大有嫌疑、乃卽派探前往將沈拘獲、當用電話通知六區、由唐領班親往將沈提回區内、</p>
<p>拘獲綁匪　訊據沈關泉供稱、該汽車四零零三號、係由友人沈金根介紹、租給於名朱三毛者、朱庽憶定盤路汪家弄十號等情、唐領班得供後、遂於前晚十二時、督同偵緝員孫樹成、周文海、曹楚翹、張玉琢、等及警長沈金章、化裝按址密往、當將朱三毛、沈金根、毛秋深、三名先後拘獲、帶回區内、訊據沈朱供認綁架黃豐鎬、現尙藏匿於眞茹蔡家橋堍草房内、可以領往等語、</p>

<h3>朱葆元遺產糾紛未已</h3>
<p>雙方所爭者爲清查賬目</p>
<p>改期一月十日傳證再訊</p>
<p>震和茶棧主海寗人朱葆元、業於本年四月間逝世、遺產二百七十餘萬、概在其長次兩子朱衍慶·順慶·掌握、而其繼室朱席新葆及已嫁未嫁之三女、均不得分嘗杯羹、心俱忿忿不平、相繼向等一特區地方法院告爭、請求判令衍慶、順慶·將全部遺產交出、按股分割、旋經衍慶昆仲挽人調解、故其已出閣之兩姊妹、因各獲得八萬金、遂將所訴撤回、惟其繼母朱席新葆要求分析之數、須六十餘萬、雖亦曾由方椒伯等出任調停、祇以衍慶等缺乏誠意、致無效果、而每次法庭傳訊、被告</p>
<p>復不到案　是以迄今尙未解决、最近纔由原告呈奉法院諭令被告將財產總數開單、聽候查核、朱氏兄弟、知非敷衍所能了事、祇得遵諭辦理、但原告對於該項清單、極不滿意、昨日午後、喬萬選推事開庭續審、時原告代理律師陳瑛將清單内之缺點、一一指出、並予攻擊、致與被告律師辯論甚烈、據陳律師稱、前次庭訊時、蒙諭准原告會同查賬、敝律師乃與對方約定、二十五日上午九時半、往震和茶棧就被告所開賬單、</p>
<p>逐欵審查　並由其交出震和茶棧之暫記客清等賬簿五六本、但皆係去年者、今年之賬簿、全不交出、僅有月結一册、爲今年之物、該月結内所記房租一項、正月份計銀三十六萬餘、而六月份因已改兩爲元、然其所記則爲三十六萬餘元、若以銀與元核算、此一項已相差十餘萬、他如上海·杭州·兩處房產、月入租金若干、詢之被告、竟不願宣布、内國公債票四十餘萬、現值二十八萬、存於何處、亦不明言、外國股票總額二十五萬餘元、據云已抵押二萬元、究係完全抵押、抑祇出押一部份、雖詢而不相告、此外尙有各種股票三萬六千餘元、亦不宣布、</p>
<p>存置處所　被告當時用意、以爲略將幾本普通賬簿交出、卽可搪塞、並非誠意查賬、查朱衍慶素來經管是項共有財產、當然熟知詳情、今乃輙云不悉、顯係推諉之詞、賬内尙有向亞東銀行抵借銀五萬兩一欵抵押品、謂係借自施少初所開之仁記公司者、惟據原告所知、該公司實係葆元出資創設、故要求票傳施少初、於下次到案質證、總之本案所爭</p>
<p>遺產數額　原告固早主張有二百七十餘萬、卽就被告所開清單而核計之、亦有九十餘萬、則其賬簿、勢必不少、當然不僅被告所交出者而已、是以原告今應向庭上聲請二事、（一）着被告將歷年以來所有賬簿、完全交出、不得絲毫隱匿、（二）准原告帶同會計師往震和茶棧核對賬目云云、被告之代表律師、對於原告之兩項請求、均竭力反對、謂葆元遺產、並無如原告所云之多、更無親筆記載之財產賬簿、震和尙在營業、故今年之賬簿、萬難交出、如必欲吊賬、則震和亦、</p>
<p>必被迫倒　彼時震和所負二十四萬之債務、自須償還、而二十六萬之債櫳、恐將犧牲、此種損失、試問原告願負担否、故吊取賬簿一層、被告甚爲反對、至帶同會計師查賬、尤不能同意、緣原告所訴爲分析遺放、並非清查賬目、何得節外生枝、故亦堅决反對云云、而原告律師、卽以因欲分產、自須先查賬目、俾可明瞭被告有無隱匿財產情弊、至葆元確有親書之財產賬簿、係於死後經被告乘爲原告移室之機會取去、原告自當到案證明等詞、與被告律師互辯良久、末則請求下次開庭時、務傳被告到案、並請補傳證人、俱經喬推事首肯、時已薄暮、庭諭改期一月十日再訊、</p>

<h3>超短波無線電話</h3>
<p>— 鑑村</p>
<p>—利用飛利浦出品之電磁式眞空管—</p>
<p>科學的進步，往往趨向於奇特方面，無線電亦然，近正趨於超短波之檢討，其成績亦日見卓著。當赫芝（ＨerinrichHortz）在一八八六—八七年作電磁振盪的實騐時，所使用的波長就是三十公厘，卽所謂超短波者，但彼時人對於此種超短波尙未知利用。是以當無線電初施諸實用時，所用波長祇限於長波（二萬至三萬米突），雖其後波長之運用，逐漸趨於較短，然當時的人都以爲能運用於長距離的通信者，祇有長波而已。殊不知後來的短波，更打破了前此錯誤的觀念，其效力不特能滿足長距離的通信，且其所消耗的電力，較之長波爲量更少。</p>
<p>自是而後，短波卽有取長波而代之之勢。且其應用範圍業已及於傳像顯影（Televiseon），物理學，化學及醫學諸方面，其具有驚異之特性已逐漸鮮明。且目下吾人實騐所得之超短波長，已與赫芝氏當年所實騐之波長近似，據飛利浦製造廠物理實騐室所舉行之實騐，以一公尺之波長試騐，所得之結果謂：超短波確可支配我無線電通信界云。</p>
<p>實騐時，用以發生振盪之眞空管乃是具有特殊構造之所謂電磁式眞空管（Magnetrons）該管之構造如上圖所示，管内裝有强力磁塲以作振盪之用。飛利浦實騐室爲該管特設計適合之構造及線路圖，使其能運用於並聯之連接，以獲得極高之效率。</p>
<p>上圖爲飛利清實騐室新近出品之新式超短波發射機，該機以兩電磁式眞空管並聯連接，須百五十瓦特之輸入，以一公尺左右之波長可得５０％之效率，較之巴克好生氏主式（Ｓystem　of　Ｂarkhausen　and　Kurz）用同一波長所得之４％，其效率之優越，可見一斑。如僅係４％區區之效率，則利用上圖所示之發射機，運用五十五公厘之波長，則不難獲得。</p>
<p>超短波的實騐仍在繼續進行中，但事實已告訴我們，其應用的範圍已可及於局部的廣播，秘密通信，航路標識，飛機，以及輪船在大霧中作標識方向之用矣。</p>
<h3>電力與音量之比率（續）—Ｄeeibel之意義—</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>即二倍收音機的電力，大概可以得到三個小倍爾。</p>
<p>同樣三倍收音機的電力，大概可以得到五個小倍爾；四保電力，可以得到六個小倍爾；八倍電力，可以得到九個小倍爾；十倍電力祇能得到十個小倍爾，或一倍爾。……總之；電力增加的倍數愈多，小倍爾的增加數便愈少。</p>
<p>聽覺有特殊訓練的人——如電話工程師，或音樂家等，在音量上祇要有一個小倍爾變動，便能辦别。普通人要有三個小倍爾的變動，纔能辦出音量的大小。</p>
<p>討論多種科學問題，最好能避免數學上的證明。本篇借用的算式，雖很簡單，但是恐怕已經要引起一般人的厭惡。現在爲求讀者易於明瞭起見，特舉一個淺顯的譬喻，解釋上述的特殊現象。</p>
<p>如圖，Ｇ爲漏斗形的玻璃杯，共分十格。先注入一立方寸的水，假足能升高三格的地位。（即達第三格的高度）再注入同量的水，因爲上大下小的關係，便祇加高二格。（高度達第五格）再注入同量的水，便祇能加高一格，……愈上則加入同量的水，增加的高度愈少。最後一格，須要二立方寸的不才能增加一格的高度。</p>
<p>現在我們將水比做電力，將高度比做小倍爾，那麽對於電力與音量的關係，便不難得到一個明晰的觀念。</p>
<p>本文寫到這裏，本可告一結束，但是或許有人以爲電力與音量成爲對數的比率，是科學上的不幸。這話在理論上說起來，原是對的，不過在事實上便要發生困難。因爲社會上許多喧閙的聲音，（如鑼鼓聲，機器聲等）牠們的振動力，大概都是很大的。人類的耳朶，對於發音力大小的感覺，如果成爲一定的比例，那麽脆薄的耳膜，恐怕已振破了。所以振動力與聲響成爲對數的比率，正是一件大幸特幸的事情。（完）</p>
<h3>調幅大於１００％之結果</h3>
<p>— 石華生</p>
<p>在普通調幅情形之下，側帶週率等於調幅百分率之半數乘載波振幅。因此最低音和最高音振幅的大小事實上是完全一樣的。假使我們現在把播音機的調幅百分數增高，那末收音機所收得的響度當然正比例於調幅百分數的增高率而加大的（參閱上期調幅的重要性一文）。現在問題就發生在這裏了，假如我們將調幅百分數加高到超過了百分这一百的時候牠的結果双怎樣呢？那末音幅的尖端就要给切去了。聽起來便要失眞，同時還要生出新的側帶來擾亂了。用這簡單的辦法事實上可以完全擾亂其他波長鄰近的電臺，使得收音提人一點都聽不出牠的樂音來了。所以歐洲的電臺，現在除了必須宣佈波長（或週率）及電力而外，還要附帶報告牠的調幅百分率。此事對於收遠地電臺的很有關係，因爲我們旣然明了牠的原理，便可以解釋故障的原由。否則一下子干涉發生了，忽然又消滅了，弄得莫明其妙，再也想不通的。總之，百分率過於一百是所不取的，除了存心搗亂。百分之一百或近於百分之一百呢，對於響度講，是很有利的，並且可以補電力之不足。然而在音樂的立塲上講，到是不到百分之一百的好，譬如說百分之三十之類。折衷的辦法百分之七八十的樣子兩者都可顧全了。</p>
<h3>半可變式短波插入式線圈之製法</h3>
<p>— ＦＲ</p>
<p>特點：線圈製成之後，其誘導率及二線圈間配合之疏密，在可能範圍内，可隨意增減。因導線並不繞於他物上，損失可减少，因此效率較平常者爲高。又因線圈之直徑小，磁力線所達之範圍可减小。</p>
<p>材料：仍用舊眞空管之底座，或特製之插入線圈管。導線則宜用較粗者，取其堅硬及阻力小：如十四號漆色線最爲適合。</p>
<p>做法：將此電線在圓銀鉛筆上繞成螺旋形，二頭各留出一二寸許，再照如附圖之方法曲成直角形，銲二線頭於線圈管之銅脚中。至圈數多少，須視配諧電容器之容量而定。</p>
<p>調整：線圈之誘導率欲其增大，則减小各圈間之距離。否則，反是。二綫圈間運配合欲其密，則减小二綫圈之間之距離。否則，反是。</p>
<p>用法：照平常。但旣經調整之後，導綫之地位，不可有所改動。</p>
<p>附註：照綫圈管内徑大小之圓筒，可套於此綫圈上，以免變動導綫之地位。若用銅或鋁質之圓筒，則除可避免撞動外，更可代隔離罩之用。</p>
<h3>標準接綫的色别</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>無線電機線路日趨複雜了，拆開無線電機一視，接線錯亂縱横，倘發生疾病，眞使修理者難於着手，因此美國國際電氣製造廠聯合會議定一種標凖接線，使便於檢查，易於修理，現在市上出售的美國無線電機，機内接線，很多採用該會議定的標凖接線了。</p>
<p>標凖接綫，以綫的顏色分别其所接的某部，指定Ｂ＋（擴大）爲紅色，Ｂ＋（檢波）爲褐色，Ｂ－爲黑而略帶紅色，Ｃ＋爲青色，Ｃ－（低）爲黑和青色，Ｃ－（高）爲黑而略帶青色，喇叭（接屏一端）爲黑而略帶褐色，喇叭（接簾橺極一端）爲褐色，喇叭勵磁圈，一爲紅色Ａ＋为黑色，Ａ－爲黑而略帶黃色。</p>

<h3>給伊們提出抗議</h3>
<p>— 傳翼之</p>
<p>本月Ｘ日本報載：據國際貿易局指導發表本年自一月至十月各國進口之香水脂粉價格，已達一百三十九萬八千六百六十四元……有人便根據這點，發表文字，痛駡婦女們，其實，這區區一百餘萬的消耗，除掉有些把香水脂粉看作「商品」中一項成本，是不得已而用的高等娼妓外，還不是少數有閑階級的少奶，小姐們給丈夫或爸爸帮忙在這項消耗品中使用他們過剩的一點金錢；大部份的婦女們，幾曾見過伊們花掉幾塊洋錢購買一兩種舶來的香水脂粉呢？而况，伊們—少奶，小姐爲要討得丈夫或戀人的歡喜，也自有其不得不用的苦衷！</p>
<p>本年六月十三日某報載路透社倫敦通迅：美國婦女每日所需之修容費，逾英金三十萬鎊，歲計之，共在一萬一千二百萬鎊以上……足見婦女們—不配稱太太小姐的例外——是專以修容爲生活條件的，而且，男子生產，女子消費，似乎也是一種天經地義的自然律；無怪美政府認男子之工資，妻子應享用一大部份，所以自七月一日起，政府所募二十萬水利工人之工資，將以六分之五，直接郵寄其妻子或家屬（見六月二十七日報載國民新聞社二十五日華盛頓電）·美國如此，中國又怎能例外？</p>
<p>况且，用香水脂粉，需要的是金錢和功夫，而有閑階級少奶，小姐們有的是金錢和光陰，記得李映碧清和夫山和尙的謔語；「昔某木匠誤勾陰府，閻羅命原勾人送回，原勾索賂不肯行·匠無物可與，念舊主沈萬三生前最富，向彼貨之·萬三曰：汝木匠也，向送我入棺，曾見我携一物來否？」金錢，只是「日中爲市」制度推翻後的交易塲中的一種抵押品，赤條條生，各色各樣的死，從没有腰纒十萬以去的·伊們便是具有這種「豪放」的心情與這種「瀟洒出塵」的人生觀，横豎不曾吃過苦賺來·朋友Ｔ君正在研究製造Nail　Polish，我問他這與人生究有什麽用處，他含笑對我說：「尋點玩意兒給伊們消閑呵！」是伊們已有充分的修飾功夫，不去噴香水，敷脂粉，呌伊們幹嗎？</p>
<p>所以，此後再有以德哥派拉談論中國摩登女子那種口吻「侮辱」中國女子，我要給伊們提出抗議。</p>
<h3>記某司機事</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>這裏所記得某司機，乃是京滬鐵路一個火車司機，他是一個生性極善良的人，而且服務經騐和駕駛技術也是非常的充足，因爲鐵路上的司機，都是從火夫升起來的；但是他竟在同一年内，在同一地點，連續的殺死了三個人，使他自己也幾乎因此而發瘋。雖然鐵路已給了他一個開革的處分，可是他心上還覺得萬分的不安，往往自己搥自己的胸，悲憤無已。不過，這是一件極離奇的故事，何以他竟會連續的在同一地點殺死三個人呢？於是我就去訪問他，得到了這件事的究竟。</p>
<p>在年頭上，他被派爲第幾次車的司機，臨時忽然病了，及展緩了三天，就在第四天上，他駕駛着一列長約五六十碼的客車從上海北站開往南京，車子開到某某兩站之間，他忽然瞧見前面軌道上有一個人在那裏行走，於是他就照例的嗚汽笛警告，以爲這個人必然會立刻避開，不料前面那人竟像是個聾子，依舊沿着鐵軌奔走，其時距離漸近了，他急得來不及的殺車，同時拚命放汽笛，但是這個人竟始終不走，活生生地在輪下輾做了三段。事後車上的職員都替他作證，證明他確曾狂嗚汽笛，並未失職，結果祇得了一個小小的處分。</p>
<p>這樣過了四五個月，他心上也漸漸地把這件事忘記了。某一日的中午，他又駕駛着一列客車，經過某某兩站之間，又到了上次出事的所在，忽見前面很遠的地方，有條人影在晃動；他就未雨綢繆的拉起長汽笛來，不停的拉，足足有二分鐘模樣，再瞧前面，一個人的影子格外清楚了。於是他就急着殺車，並知照火夫帮同狂嗚汽笛，不料這個人竟像釘住在那裏一般的老是站着不動，而火車又不是立刻可以停止的，結果便發生了第二件慘案。他簡直不敢下車去看了，他覺得這事情太古怪，一個人躱在司機間内盡量的發抖，再也不能繼續駕駛火車前進了。這一次他足足病了半個月。還得到了一個大過的處分。但是不久他又恢復工作了。當然不能更調别的職務，還是當司機。某次，他駕着隔夜開的夜車在清早八九點鐘的時候，又到某某兩站之間了，在明晃晃的太陽光下，突見一個人像發瘋似的從旁路上奔到了軌道上來，這一次他的第一步動作及是殺車，拚命的殺，不顧了機械的殺，但是那個人竟迎着火車衝來，使他害怕得一手用力拉汽笛，一手掩住了自己的眼睛，不敢再往前看了。然而待到車子殺住，輪下已添了一具不完全的屍體了。最奇怪的是仍在前兩次出事的地方，至多不過幾丈路的差别。</p>
<h3>寒夜</h3>
<p>— 醉竹</p>
<p>濛濛的細雨，一陣陣飄來。街角上的路燈，緑幽幽的是這樣的黯淡。那凛冽的西北風，最愛和窮人親近。見了大毛厚氅的富家翁，是遠而避之的。難得一聲兩聲，街車上的鈴聲，點綴着這悽寂的寒夜。</p>
<p>這時馬路兩旁的店家，大概因天氣寒冷，市面清淡的緣故，家家都已上門。辛苦了一天的店夥，攤開鋪蓋，往被窩裏一鑽，這是他的天堂。不多時，齁齁的鼾聲，和門外的風聲，便奏起交響曲來。</p>
<p>打鼾的聲音，順着風，吹到對面水果攤上學徒的耳朶裏，不由把頭頸縮了一縮。心想店家夥計，何等寫意？此時已早早的，暖暖的睡了。我就這樣倒體；天天喝風，喝到十二點敲過。想到這裏，抬起眼來，朝老闆看着。老闆似乎已懂得他的意思，嫩嫩的往四面看了一看。道：「收攤吧！」又往錢桶看看，搖了一搖頭。</p>
<p>學徒巴不得這一聲！頓時凛冽的北風，變的和煦的春風。喜孜孜忙着收了攤，一步步跟着老闆回家睡去了。</p>
<p>這時，街角上，有個流浪的朋友，雖已在十一點的寒夜，却還没有個宿處。眼看着水果攤收回去，不由吁了一口酸氣！心想他們無論遲早，都有個師宿。惟有我；却像個失林的鳥兒，永無着落。摸摸袋裏，祇有十幾個銅元，再也休作那熱被窩的妄想。可恨這兩旁許多高聳着的洋房，便不能容留我這小小身軀。世界是這樣的不公平！他只顧憤憤地信着脚步走去，猛聽得樓頭一陣笑聲，在那碧緑的窗吊裏傳下來。抬頭一看，同時見兩個人影，慢慢的，慢慢的，凑攏來，突然！摟在一起。半天，半天，又是嗤的一笑，依舊回復了兩個影子。……這時，却把這「流浪者」看得呆了！彷彿自己腦筋裏，也有過那麽一回事。……他很想拉直了嗓子，呌那帘中人，别做這粉紅色的好夢；因爲好夢背後，便是像今夜這樣黯淡的燈光，是要喝西北風過日子的。但他没有這股勇氣；因爲世界本來是這柆不平等的，做夢的做夢，流浪的流浪。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回　絮語燈前苦心訓弱息　杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>江氏將桌上那盞小罩煤油燈，向旁邊推了一推，讓桂枝多得着一些燈光，兩手按住衣料，向桂枝看着半晌微笑道：人家說，瞧新聞，瞧新聞。你在那兒找了這張陳報來看，這不是瞧新聞，是瞧舊聞了。你統共認得幾個字？也瞧報！桂枝道：這是後面老太爺瞧下來的報，小林給拿過來的。我也無聊，解個悶兒，認識幾個字，就瞧那段，不認識的，我就不瞧。江氏道：小林好端端的送報你瞧作什麽？桂枝不抬起頭來，却微微的抬着眼皮，向他母親一笑道：這有什麽不懂的，也不過讓我看報上的新聞，說是口外地面，現在都太平着啦。江氏聽說，兩手依然按在膝蓋上，於是微微的點了兩點頭，表着一番赞許之意。因道：像趙家老太爺這種人，眞是疼兒女的。我們旣然是作了親戚，就光瞧老人家這一番好意，我們也當好好的待人家，有道是人心換人心啦。桂枝手按了報，望着母親道：你</p>
<p>說的這番話，是什麽意思，我倒有些不懂。他嘴裏雖然如此說着，但是他兩隻眼睛，依然望了報上，並不注意母親。江氏微昻着頭，歎了一口氣。有他歎氣的時候，眼睛已經不望着女兒，却看那盞煤油燈罩，有了一會，才自言自語的道：這海甸街上，閑人太多，無事還興風作浪，要道論東家長西家短。若是你家要有一點兒短處，那就得了，加上一些油鹽作料，這笑話兒就多啦。有道是：寡婦門口是非多。我是一個寡婦，姑娘又是一個獨生，嗐！凡事總得再三的謹愼才是。雖然說現在改良的年頭兒，可也得看什麽事。作女人的，講個三從四德，到那兒也說得過去。（二八一）</p>
<p>術蹤听</p>
<h3>閩遊追憶（下）</h3>
<p>— ＳＹ</p>
<p>福州的漆器，精巧玲瓏，馳譽各省，不過價錢非常貴，在我們外省人去買，往往要超也一倍以上。在吃的方面，閩菜也算以考究出名的，但價錢都比較上海閩菜館不便宜。這裏人家和館子上，煮出來的飯，差不多像珠子般粒粒分開，所人黏性，已完全失掉，這種飯，在我們吃起來，實在吃不慣，據說他們煮飯，米下鍋之後，等到水沸了，便將有黏性的，米水倒出，或是棄掉，或是由洗衣店收買去，作洗衣服之用，所以飯是不能吃，而洗的</p>
<p>衣服，却是特别考究。</p>
<p>福州洗浴的水，完全是温泉，和南京的湯山一樣。水裏略有琉璜氣息，於人們的身體方面，很有益的。所以這裏的浴室，也很著名，在城裏有一條路，呌做温泉路，這條路上的温泉浴室，在福州要算最多，就中最摩登的，是百合公司的明園浴室，每個浴池，都有房間，或是兩個浴池一個房間，男女都可以去，不過女的另外分開，有女招待招呼，浴池房間之外，有荷花池，有假山樹木，風景極清幽雅美之至。</p>
<p>小西湖在西門相近，樹木並不多，有茶亭，可容十個人休憇，湖心置品艇十餘，夕陽將下，便有一對對的情侶，並肩坐小舟中，蕩漾湖心，其他也沃有什麽可述的地方，比之杭州的西湖，那是天差地遠了。</p>
<p>距離省城大概三十里左右的鼓山，在福州是極有名的，不過當天來回來不及，至少總要山上住一天，我們去的時候，共有六個男性，兩個女性，雇了兩輛汽車，風馳電掣般，到了山麓，各人奮勇上山，可是不到一半，已多數走不動，便換乘肩與，繼續努力，不料忽然天不做美，下起毛毛雨來，頃刻之間，竟愈下愈大，這時已遠半山，退又不能，沃有法子，只得任雨淋着，所以到了山上，都已像落湯鷄一般。山上有一所很大的寺院，可惜此刻竟把寺名忘掉，我們到達時，許多僧徒，正在做佛事，聽了貝葉聲聲，各人忽然都有些大澈悟起來，齊向僧寺借了套僧衣穿上，拍了一張全體僧裝照，只有兩位密司，我們要她們暫時充一充尼姑，却無論如何不肯，也只得作罷。這一夜我們就宿在寺内明月樓，在樓中我們發現了兩件東西，一個是像貓一般大的老鼠，一個是像碗口般大的蜘蛛，當這碩大無朋的蜘蛛發現時，兩位密司，竟驚得大呌起來，一夜之間，我們只聲了一宵的雨聲，給蚊蟲擾得一點都睡不穩。天明，雨已略停，我們便各處略兜了一轉，下山回去，可以說是乘興而來，敗興而歸，名山勝處，依舊沃有領略到，等到我第二次到福州時，聽說鼓山已發生過綁案，不能去了。</p>
<p>我第一次去的時間，本來不預備長久，所以不多幾天，就回到上海，第二次本來預備長久，不料一到福州，共產黨正在延平方面作閙，福州大爲吃緊，我們同伴中，還有携帶家眷的，所以嚇得没辦法，只索往香港一跑，這時我就决定等上海的船，暫時住在蒼前山朋友家裏，過了幾天，三北公司的萬象到了，豈知等我去定房間，早已没有，最後總算由熟人費力九牛二虎之力，弄到一個房間，並且我還預先一天上船，以免擁擠，可是在小汽船到馬江時，因爲船小浪大，天又入夜，幾乎發生危險，末後總算平安到船，在房間裏悶睡了一夜，明天的午飯時，我便在海天浩渺中給萬象載歸上海來了。</p>

<h3>從江湖到洋塲</h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>江湖是隱士豪客的出處。</p>
<p>鼎革以後，一般遺老遺少，明知大勢已去，不能再替主子盡力，於是附庸風雅，相率做起隱士來。今天寫幾首詩，明天塡一闋詞，養籠鳥，種盆花，這個是「烟霞舊侶」，那個是「江湖散人」。便是二十幾歲小伙子，只要哼得上幾句，也便「道人」「居士」，親加誥封；好像一輩子要和烟水爲伍，其實只是閙市寓公，洋塲闊少，連一些江湖氣息都没有的。</p>
<p>然而誰敢說這些不是隱士！</p>
<p>其實如今不但隱士要遯迹洋塲，便是豪客，也還要脫離江湖的。上海就有許多替人代抱不平的英雄。如果鄉下有甚麽姑娘羡慕都市的繁華，獨個兒到上海來，就有「仗義疎財」的豪客們，自願出來陪着看戲，吃點心，開棧房，最後還得來一下「千里送蛾眉」，一送就送進火坑去。</p>
<p>萬一家裏派人來尋，那就更好。於是又有一批豪客挺身而出，帮着分頭去找；照例總是找着的，但不能見面，先得使用些銀錢。等到錢一到手，於是推托幾句，好像是「功敗垂成」，再不然便「鴻飛冥冥」。</p>
<p>但也未必飛到江湖上去。</p>
<p>捉姦，打譂，尋隙頭，吃講茶，也總有這些洋塲豪客們的份。</p>
<p>洋塲自然是熱閙了。隱士豪客以外，看相，算命，變戲法，賣街拳，玩西洋鏡，早已應有盡有。從前是走江湖，現在是坐洋塲。</p>
<p>這裏好像要安適得多，江湖應該是冷落了吧！</p>
<h3>「蒹葭蒼蒼白露爲霜」（續）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>所以，詩人借物起興，選取寄託情緒的對象是第一件事。我記起紅樓夢裏有一段故事，說賈寳玉在被父親痛打以後，有一天，要呌睛雯送兩條半新不舊的絹子給林黛玉；睛雯只怕惱了林黛玉，不肯送；賈寳玉道：「你放心，她自然知道。」果然，林黛玉體貼出絹子的意思來，不覺神痴心醉，還題了幾首絶句在上頭了。這兩條絹子在紅樓夢凡三次出現；直到林黛玉臨終，還狠命撕毁這兩條絹子，用以洩心頭的憤恨。千言萬語說不了的私情，只要用兩條手絹就表示得非常親切，可見賈寳玉選擇得不錯。又相傳某畫師以「下雨滴空階」爲畫題，「空階」只是一個抽象的觀念，「滴」只是心下明白筆下難畫的觀念，使人難於着筆的。某生徒畫一畫童，持硯一方，承薝取滴，把題旨完全烘托出來，這也是選材的得當。總之，情緒是「抽象的」，而我們表現他，必得「具體的」，越表現得眞切，越能感動人。我曾在一處攝影展覽會看到一張以挑水夫爲題材的作品，浩波淼森，人影歷歷，作品上題着「人世一肩」一語，寫盡了人間世的苦辛，爲之神往久之。蒹葭一詩，一腔無可奈河的神情，使千載後人低徊不已，不也有同一的意味嗎？</p>
<p>自來抒情詩，當以興體爲正格；蒹葭白露，就是恰到好處的代表作品。前人說興體，未免近於玄妙；我覺得把燃起情緒的對象爲着筆之始，也可說是近於客觀的標凖了。</p>
<p>諸位是研究文藝的，我姑且愚妄地弄斧一下。</p>
<h3>讀匈牙利文學史</h3>

<p>十九世紀五十年代的匈牙利老百姓一方面旣懷民族阽危之憂，他方面又負專制淫威之痛，於是就產生了愛國詩人。最敢言而又最愛民衆擁戴的，是貝多菲。而阿拉納（Ｊ·Arany）亦與齊名。讀他的臂喻體詩「被縶的鶴」根可以想見詩人當時的環境及其民族的地位。但他還有「幸運的，」和他同時代而又齊名的湯伯（M·Tompa）可就没有那樣做詩的自由。</p>
<p>湯伯是不得不多做譬喻體詩的。他針對着「被縶的鶴」作了一首詩「逾鶴」，大意是這樣的：「春來了，鶴回到老窠來了；但是鶴呵，你可受了欺騙了，因爲我們這裏並没有春。飛回到快樂的天空去罷，不要找我們的草原，我們的草原已經變成了墳場。不要立在我們的池沼裏，因爲池沼裡的水是混和了人血的。也不要棲止在我們屋頂，屋頂上有的是火燒的木頭。回到南方去罷，因爲你比我們幸福，上帝給你兩個家，而我們只有一個，而甚至連這一個也已失去。飛回去罷，要是在那邊南方你遇到先前從我們這裏逃出去的人，你就對他們說，我們是一天一天的衰落了，削弱了，而且瓦解了。」</p>
<p>至於貝多菲，很少作譬喻體的詩。當一八四八年三月十四日，革命爆發的消息傳到匈京，使得内閣倒台的時候，貝多菲就寫了著名的「我們匈牙利，」於十五日在廣大的羣衆面前朗誦。這詩每章的末句是「我們宣誓，誓不再爲奴隸！」萬聲競和，——用現在一句現成話，就等於喊口號似的。貝多菲誦詩旣畢，羣衆立刻湧到印刷所，延走Ｃenseur，把這首詩印成。這是第一首不經過Censure而出版的詩！</p>
<p>懿歟盛哉！愛國的詩人，民族的文學家！原來倒不必靠Sabre的力量去發表作品，這在我看來，總疑心那是文學史家的說謊哩！</p>
<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>把車子停在街邊，坐在車蹬子上休息着，他又想起那件事情了。</p>
<p>那件事情緊纒着他有半個多月了，即或在晚上睡夢中，也常常驚醒過來，「五十萬頭奬，」眞是一筆大財！他要發財，因而他睡不熟，惦記着，盤算着。</p>
<p>幾天來，他當眞想冒一次險，化兩塊錢買那麽兩小條。兩塊錢，是他幾年來在拉車中偷偷藏起來的，藏在腰帶子裏，就連他自己的老婆都不知道。現在，他想用這絶無僅有的歷年積儲去發一筆大財了。</p>
<p>「五十萬，眞是一筆大財。」</p>
<p>他重復念着，可是，他總是缺乏勇氣，所以這幾天到底還没有買。他自己想的很明白；那麽多的號數，那能就讓自己碰上呢？自己的運命是不行的，不然也不會受這些年的痛苦了。而他是有些信賴命運的，兩塊錢因此就得以保存在腰帶中没有動一動。</p>
<p>然而他是矛盾的，他又想：那，不是也難免就碰上麽？頭奬就算不敢希求，二奬，三奬許多小奬，那一奬不是都比兩塊錢多，只要能中上，那就都行了。小六子也是拉黃包車的，他上月就得了二十塊，不能說拉黃包車的就不能得奬，就没有好運氣。</p>
<p>正在這時，他停車旁邊的一個烟紙店裏的小夥計們大聲地喊了起來：</p>
<p>「想發財快來買罷，就剩三天了，航空公路奬劵，頭奬五十萬，一塊錢買一條！」</p>
<p>櫃台前，擠着滿滿的人，發狂似地掏着自己的袋子，不猶豫不吝嗇地把雪白的洋錢交上去，然後收到了紙劵，僅買到寳似地快活地走了開了，人們那樣地忙着購買，有如過一會那財氣就要離開似的，只有這一刻，買了劵就會發財。他有點心慌了，他要幹幹。</p>
<p>「憑命由老天！」</p>
<p>下着最後的决心，他從車蹬上立起身，終於擠進人羣中，過一會，再擠出來時，兩條票劵代替了他那兩張鈔票。</p>
<p>「００一七八五」</p>
<p>「四六七二０三」</p>
<p>他牢牢地記住那兩條票劵上的號數，這號數，還要跟着他的睡眠記入睡夢中的。</p>
<p>旣然把歷年僅有的積蓄化過了，爲的要發大財，只有把希望都放在期待上了，他期待着兩天後的二十九號，那一天，會有一種轉變臨到他的頭上，不是「悲哀」，就是「快樂」。</p>
<p>但是現刻，他却是帶着快活的心情，拉着車子走了。</p>
<h3>客窗小記</h3>
<p>— 珠</p>
<p>十八</p>
<p>吾曾作兩文，以記東坡文被禁事矣。近讀「袁小修集」，又獲得一重要材料。此係小修在「龍湖遺　小序」一文中說及者：</p>
<p>子瞻生平所著作，自宿州符下之後，半入蛟宮。其臨池揮洒之餘，爲人藏於複壁者，猶不能保。直至宣和之世，上章道士，指爲奎宿，然後施弛蘇文之禁。</p>
<p>當時禁坡文之嚴，有竟至如此者。其後弛禁，所云根據道士指爲奎宿，殊令人難信。因具有政治性事件的解决，决不會如此簡單也。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（七四）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>他靈魂裏的利己心已戴上了廉直的假面具，一切改裝隱藏着的利益都在他的靈魂裏鬭爭着，互相搏擊着。最初的懸慮在巧妙的推論前讓位了，隨後再出現，隨後又再消失了。</p>
<p>他轉來坐下，他在尋覓着一個决定的動機，一個堅强的可以固定他的猶疑，可以說服他那天生的正直的口實。他已多次提出這個問題：「我旣然是這人的兒子，我旣已知道這事，並已承認做他的兒子，我接受他的財產不也是狠自然的事嗎？」可是這個論證却不能阻止他的良心對他低低說着「不行」。</p>
<p>突然他想到：「我旣然不是我從前以爲是我的父親的那人的兒子，那我便再不能從他那裏接受什麽，不論是當他生時或死後。這是旣不應該也不公允的事。這筆財產將來應當歸我的哥哥」。</p>
<p>這種新的觀察方法使他輕鬆了一點，使他的良心緩和了一點，他又回到窗口。</p>
<p>「對啦，」他心想，「我不應再接受家裏的遺產，我得把它完全讓給筆爾，因我不是他父親的兒子。這是應當如此的。那麽我保有着我的父親的財產不也是應當的嗎？」</p>
<p>他旣已承認他不能利用羅蘭的財產，他旣已决定把它完全抛棄，他便同意並讓自己保有瑪賴沙的一份，因爲假使他兩份都不受，那他便會成爲赤貧的。</p>
<p>這宗困難的事情旣經解决，他便又想到筆爾在家裏的問題。怎樣能夠使他離開家裏呢？他正想不出一個可以實行的辦法時，一隻開進碼頭的汽船的哨聲好像給了他一個回答似的，給他暗示了一個主意。</p>
<p>於是他和衣倒在他的床上一直夢想到天明。</p>
<p>將近九點鐘的時候，他出門去探看他的計劃有没有實行的可能。隨後，在奔走了幾處地方，看訪了幾個人之後，他來到他雙親的家裏。他的母親關在房裏等着他。</p>
<p>「如果你不來的話，」她說，「我决不敢下去。」</p>
<p>話才話完立刻便聽到羅蘭在樓梯上呌道：</p>
<p>「難道今天不吃東西了，媽的！」</p>
<p>没有人回答，他便怒嗚着：</p>
<p>「約瑟芬勒，天啦！你在幹什麽？」</p>
<p>女僕從地下室裏發出的聲音：</p>
<p>「在這裏呀，先生，你要什麽？」</p>
<p>「太太在那裏？」</p>
<p>「太太和哲安先生在樓上。」</p>
<p>於是他向上一層樓抬起頭呌道：</p>
<p>「路易茲？」</p>
<p>羅蘭媽媽半開了房門回答：</p>
<p>「什麽事，朋友？」</p>
<p>「難道我們不吃東西嗎，媽的！」</p>
<p>「好啦，我們來了。」</p>
<p>於是她走下來，後面跟着哲安。</p>
<p>羅蘭看見了青年便大聲說：</p>
<p>「嚇，你就來了！你已厭倦了你的新居嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有，父親，但我今早有事要和媽媽商量。」</p>
<p>哲安攤開手掌走上前來，當他感到自己的手被老頭兒慈愛地緊握着時，一種没有料到的奇怪的感動使他痙攀起來，那分離的，没有希望再回來的永訣的感動。</p>

<p>花十二月份鄭標花、在七月一日上塲、價爲四十五元六角、届時在陳花時代、以存貨日缺、與紗成一反比例、七八月份軋空呼聲、高唱入雲、遠期新花亦受其影響、故棉價終較紗價爲高、後以吾國財長宋子文在美國賒購棉麥借欵、簽字成立消息傳來、市塲震動有一度小跌風、但買方仍拉緊不放、嗣至八月八日美棉政府估計豐收、價格不穩、同時吾國以稻穀價目低落、新棉田增加三分之一、而雨水調匀、棉產景象良好、市價逐漸向下、最低曾見三十九元外、旋至新花上市之際、以水分潮濕、交解標準有不及格之說、市價又回漲至四十一元五六角、延至本月份中、以紗價維持失敗、紗價發現新低峯、而廠採辦頗滯、廠方無進胃、又跌進關内、最低曾至三十八元四角、但買方甬帮及一廠商堅意收貨、散空抵補、又回漲至三十九元九角、結果殘餘一萬五千五百担、交割價三日扯爲三十九元五角、收貨者寗波商獨收、交貨散户貨品火機花通州花、茲將收交兩方經紀商及牌名號數量額列表於后、以資參考、</p>

<h3>現紗花消費清淡</h3>
<p>紗市仍無變化、但各方銷路頗滯、因歲暮結果關係、客帮停頓、海關亦封關三日、交易愈見清淡、標準紗因月末辦理交割、停止拍板、客帮僅有内地帮進一百九十六包、廣東帮進二十六包、行情與上日相仿、</p>
<p>花市仍平穩、以海外棉市平定、現棉日廠進意又動、來源計通花七百三十四包、姚花六百五十九包、現棉價如下、</p>

<h3>紗布五六月期標花議决明年照常開拍</h3>
<p>本埠紗市交易所爲花紗標準問題、爭持甚久、據市塲傳聞、花紗皆欲改換之說、今日午後三時在本所大市塲經紀人召集會議、討論一切、結果議决棉花自民國二十三年一月四日起開拍五月期六月期標花營業、標準仍照舊、一致贊成、惟棉紗標準改革未定、暫時仍停拍、未有解决辦法</p>
<h3>美棉買户踴躍</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因華爾街有力、買户踴躍、市况堅定活潑、後因多頭了結而回、結果現貨漲五磅普、期貨漲二至四磅</p>
<p>市價音、英棉漲五點、期貨漲四至六點、埃及棉現貨漲二三點、印棉初因印日會議消息不佳而疲、後因空户抵補略堅、結果平果爾跌半羅比、奥姆楝跌二角半、白羅溪不動、原電錄左、（二十八日電）</p>

<h3>河下米平定如故</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源各帮祇到三四十號、（五千餘石）其中晚稻市况雖日來到貨亦稀、但以去路有限、致浦積漸厚、更兼國曆年關在卽、勢難有大胃、故其趨向已乏轉機可能、而觀乎售方袒然無急脫之　則　亦無急穗直下走勢是其年内僅　平平之現象、計今市包胃雖猶動動、然其客帮及上棧共祇六百餘包、因之行情仍無榮辱、惟中關才後有特殊去路、　略秀近尺、客商原　成到銷兩平、致市　猶屬定局、杜尖洋貨乏、挺秀數分、陰變元、亦稍帶緊、</p>
<p>（滬北）河下各地到船七十餘　、市上各種銷路因天宮陰雨、買方上市寥落、致去胃滯細、市形白粳白元陰元早薄稻羊杜埠客秈各色平定、</p>
<h3>客秈價小動銷</h3>
<p>本街囤户有問津意</p>
<p>昨客秈市况、承前日疲風、市面繼續趨下、且存底充足、客化呆滯、人心難以振作、昨市各米續小五六分至近角不等、市價小後本客始有問津、本街囤户以目下價格已達底碼硌地需要均殷、守至時局平靖、勢有大帮去化、故心思已見活動、日内當有在市吸收之實現也、目下則注意於河下米與廠米、聞已有數萬包之囤買、客秈守囤户問津後、市面方有轉機、昨本街與囤户已辦成湖南機油五百九十包、價七元二角半至七元二角、又機紅米二百五十包、價六元八角半至六元八角、甬帮復去江西機晚三百包、價七元一角半至七元零八分、泉州亦去蕪湖機元米五十包、價七元六角、無錫機元米一百八十包、價八元一角八分、</p>
<h3>黃荳漲跌互見</h3>
<p>昨日下檔黃荳續漲三四分、上中貨明雖平穩、但趨勢　　　　二分、去路本　　家及丙　車坊均有問津、并成史車輪各　約十四三車、　市塲人氣稍定、刻下來源、火車貨因車輛缺乏、到頭寥落、　均　積在蚌　　　上亦喊緊一些、輪船貨比較聯接、故歸德荳及碭山荳等市勢尙覺見軟云、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>青白糖均見鬆象</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以荷匯見長、關金略小、趨勢依然疲弱、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨劃十九元四角、比前日又小一角、八九號荷赤ＳＲ嘜劃十五元七角半、太古糖呌二十元一角半、未成、振記一號棉白又小五分、爲十八元五角、二三四號照退、潮青無甚上落、昨開百數包、價爲十二元七角至十二元三角、建帮號家所到新刁青言明今日可出貨者、十二元四角、比前盤小去二角、其勢尙有鬆象、</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<h3>汕頭餅暫告斷擋</h3>
<p>汕頭大橘餅邇來到貨甚少、號存亦缺、昨聞業已開通、暫告斷擋、查前盤爲三十元半、後市或有升望云、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>洋莊絲市依然不振</h3>
<p>紐約存絲不弱　紐約入冬以來、日絲進口仍不見弱、昨據各法莊傳出消息、紐約存絲仍厚、在耶誕節前、紐約全市共存中日意法等國生絲七八萬包、其間日本絲佔七萬包弱、中國絲三千七八百包、意法等國絲亦達四千餘包云、</p>
<p>絲頭出口退化　我國絲　下脚、（卽絲頭）輸出益趨退化、最近一旬中、滬謁報運出口共祇二百五十三擔、美洲竟無運往、里昂馬賽变祇裝去八十五擔云、</p>
<p>年關人造絲銷停滯　年關已届、銀根奇緊、人造絲客銷完全停滯、昨祇本街各綫帶廠稍有小包交易、市面清平、惟各客帮手中存貨、現正分批裝出、是以滬杭路運輸頗形忙碌云、</p>
<p>歐美絲銷仍無生氣　紐約生絲市塲近因年關期近、廠銷益呈呆滯、係價終難立住、横濱日絲市價之乍漲乍跌、純絲投機家之操縱、歐美實銷難望轉機、滬埠華洋絲商態度均仍消極、益無生氣之可言、綢門銷胃亦因年關停滯、現絲成交無關、殊乏市况之足述云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>彌縫政策</h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>在充滿着矛盾的現世界，有許多不必要而明知「此路不通」的事，却儼然地存在着，進行着，失業救濟，便是其中的一例。</p>
<p>論理，天旣賦人以兩手兩足及一付腦筋，則除了不願生存的外，誰都有憑此工具，以獲得他生存所需要的物質的權利，誰也不能剥奪誰，也没有理由可以剥奪。以世界上的能力，養活世界上的人，「業」如何會失？又何待於救濟！然而現在「失業」竟成爲普遍的現象，而「救濟」也成爲各國内政的重要問題了。</p>
<p>「業」而至於「失」，是人力之未盡可知，但人力的未盡，是否由於物質生活的已有餘裕，可再無需乎勞動？曰不然，飢寒的呼聲，正充遍了大地，卽號稱最爲富庶的美國也不能免。只是銀行家的櫃中有餘錢，大商人的堆棧裏有餘貨而已！金錢藏在華爾街，小麥傾在海裏，棉田限種，機器塵封着，而由全社會人喊着「不景氣」！這樣，全世界三千萬人怎樣失去其業，我們就可知道了！</p>
<p>有一回，俄國的小說家皮湼克，到美國去游歷，看見，大工廠關了門，機器塵封着，倉庫裏的貨物在鼠嚙腐蝕，而街頭却有成千累萬鳩形鵠面的失業工人浪蕩着，他認爲奇蹟。誠然，在一個從另一世界裏跑過來的人看來，這眞是一個奇蹟。</p>
<p>失了業，固然連帶的也失去了生存的保障，但生存是每個有生命的東西所要最後保持的，鷄狗的臨終，尙能奮其最後的一擊，而况於人？「挺而走險」，「物極必反」，聰明的經濟家是會想到這些的。於是不得不從其利潤中取出一部分來，充作救濟金，買一個「暫維現狀」。同時更可表示這是出於自己的「恩典」，而收到一個「慈善」或「慷慨」的美譽，把危機壓伏下去。但這樣做，是否能將這個深入的非業恐慌，彌縫過去，而天下從此「太平無事」？這是我們的資本家所想不到的。倘然想到，那也不會這樣傻，每年拿出成千成萬的金錢來，做極無聊的救濟工作，以求苟延喘於一時了。而當有更進一步的表示。「解鈴還是擊鈴人」，還各個人以工作。然而這又不成其與現代社會。</p>
<h3>東方文明之一—婦女纒足</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>最近報載外人在張家口一帶各鄉村，攝取我國舊式婦女纒足照片，作惡意宜傳，政府認爲「攸關國體」，業已通令全國一體嚴密查禁，此事我們當然覺得快意。因爲將我們貴國的「三寸金蓮」，拿去擺在外國的人種博物院裏觀覽，當然充分帶着侮辱性，不予以查禁，勢必「攸關國體」。</p>
<p>不過中國婦女的纒足，是女子在以前舊禮敎束縛下的產物，欲求不給外國陳列在博物院，當古董一樣的玩弄，以致有傷國體，似乎應得在天足運動及打破舊禮敎上做點工夫。所謂欲求「家醜」不外揚，當於根本無「歹名劣蹟」着手。中國「三寸金蓮」的產生，原非若目前「摩登」仕士女拾之「歐化」，高跟其鞋捲燙其髮好時髦得來，却正如在此社會日趨没落淫冶之風熾行，女子必以粉腿胸酥作商標實行「零躉拍賣」的爲時代所骼，環境所迫而風靡一時一樣。固然在「金蓮」已經「風靡」一般拜脚狂的騷客詩人的吹捧是盡了很大的推動作用，如「嫺嫺蓮步」，「玉立婷婷」，眞描寫之淋漓而盡致，大有願天下「錦繡才子」皆求拜到「金蓮」足下之慨；實則主要爲「男主乎外女主乎内」的名敎使然。女子在「内言不出外言不入」及「緊鎖深閨」的幽禁之下，一些閨秀名媛太太奶奶的兩足，具而不用，自然成了廢物。同時因爲男子對女子的佔有性，爲保持貞潔避免「淫奔」事件發生，將足纒小，到是一個好的辦法。在這個意義有上，「三寸金蓮」在中國確有時代意義，至少在維持風化上有不少的功績；如果說中國還有文化，還有值得保留的精神和道德，那還在「五倫」之一的夫婦間起着很大的道德作用的婦女纒足，雖不敢與「國學」「國故」並列，至少也是國粹之一！</p>
<p>中是千不該萬不該，外國的兵艦大砲衝破了我們的「閉關自守」，竟隨之而來了西歐的「物質文明」，激蕩了我們的「禮義之邦」；在交際塲中，需要我們幽嫻貞靜的婦女穿高跟鞋到跳舞塲跳「華爾茲」，到公園散步談心；而未具躡足交際塲中資格的婦女，也要求她們早晨六點鐘跑幾里路去作工，以求振興實業，自然蓮步趲行的婦女就「不能勝任」了。因之我們文豪詩家用生花之筆，來描寫，涎沬俱無談論的「三寸金蓮」，就不能不没落，由「美德」而變成「惡習」了。</p>
<p>事至而今，婦女纒足之爲惡俗，凡稍具新智識及尙「摩登」者，盡得而知之道之，尤其青年學生中，偶言及此，必嗤之以鼻而嘔諸胸，一股憎厭嫉惡之情，大有不堪形容者在，足見天足運動似有相當效果。不過徴之事實，則宋必然。許多抱有「國故」「國萃」癖者，及關心風化的衛道之士，眼見淫糜之風盛行，因而提倡保持舊道德，尊孔道，讀孝經列女傳，甚有拿着；富於道德精神的「東方文明」以與純趨物質的「西方文明」拒抗。這樣的表現，到不如乾脆主張婦女纒足，贊美「三寸金蓮」，願天下錦繡才子皆來拜倒「金蓮」脚下爲爽快。</p>
<p>西歐人有個絶妙的譬喻說，如果要了解一個國家社會文明的程度，可以尋之於女人所用胭脂面粉香水之多少；若果以爲中國過去還有東方文明可以保存，還有精神道德值得贊美；爰用此例，那到要奉　一般憤世嫉俗之「東方文明」的提倡者，何必斤斤於埋頭書叢中去「整理」，只在「金蓮」之是否三寸，「弓鞋」之是否洽好「一搦」上加以一番統計，便可見出「東方文明」目前的地位來。</p>
<p>不久以前有一歐洲人，眼見西歐基督敎爲「物質慾」所薰染，已失原有敎義，便不惜遠渡重洋的跑來中國皈依佛法；佛敎之主清靜無爲貴精神道德，亦爲「東方文明」的骨髓；這次外人的到張家口攝取纒足照片，或許是懷有崇拜「東方文明」的「三寸金蓮」的意思罷？余言果中，不但用不着取締，到是「東方文明」的朋友們值得大大的與「便利」大關歡迎會的事情了！</p>
<h3>有關女人</h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>最近有兩個朋友—畢正在忙於訂婚，鵬正在忙於追求，幾個人碰在一起，就專門談女人。在這尴尬的年代裏，彷彿有人下過定論：凡談戀愛，談女人的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，都是没出息的崽子，至少是没落的小布爾喬亞。然而我們却確是些「其貧如洗」的夥計兒，特别是鵬；若不每天埋頭去幹自己所不願意的事，就隨時有挨餓的可能。</p>
<p>本來我們也喜歡談國事，只是時代已是「風調雨順」，據說國事早已用不着我們這輩小子多呶嘴。而且爲明哲保身計，我們也生怕隔壁的夥計們聽見了，順勢去報個風，把我們抓將去，認眞辦起來，别的都不打緊，只有還不曾長温過女人夢，是最遺憾的事了。這，畢最爲害怕，因爲他就曾經挨受過這度恐怖。就是轾輕的被判坐三五年牢監，也是犯不着的事。</p>
<p>談最時髦的「國貨」或「般空建設」麽，又覺得這些於我們太没緣分，談起來恐怕不大動聽。</p>
<p>談風月麽，我們又都是些「俗而不雅」的粗裏粗魯的夥計，勉强的凑談幾句，亦未免貽笑大方，太煞風景也。</p>
<p>於是就决定談女人，幾個人一碰着面就專門談女人。</p>
<p>依照幾千年來的道理人情講，女人也並非不可談，說得賣勁些，女人之被需要，是幾乎和吃飯一樣的迫切，而且談出去，也要平穩得多，法小說家歌德派拉那樣的諷剌，侮辱我們的女同胞，也僅只惹起某女作家的抗議，至若我們談起來，保定連理睬的人都没有，那不是逃罪與發洩心竅的最好辦法麽！</p>
<p>畢找着的一位女人，據說美的地方很多，只是在某處有一顆大黑痣，是美中不足，幾分「破相」的遺恨。但是畢熱戀着伊，已在訂婚了，他活怕旁人注目他的情人的黑痣，於是他見人就說，我就是愛伊那顆黑痣，吻起來，首先要狂吻那黑痣，這種哲學，雖頗玄妙，確也是意義别致，值得玩味。鵬正在追求的那位女將軍，雖然品貌不惡，但我們都嫌伊的面太闊，條子也太戰調了，而鵬却說他正是愛伊的闊面，與單闊的條子，幾乎奉之像一位天使，求之不得的在熱烈的追逐。語到自己的園，我覺得伊實在可愛，也實在很美，我若没有伊，眞寗願此生獨身，但旁的人就當面都對我說，並不美，也並不如何可愛。</p>
<p>事實上平心而論，各個的女人都只有那麽美，那麽可愛；然而各個對之都很熱心，不，都很狂熱的戀着，這其間，輯成哲學，便是：「凡是自己找得的女人，不美，也成了美的；不可愛，也成了可愛的」。也就是相傳有句老話：「情人眼裏出西施」，的確不錯。</p>
<p>反過來說，凡是被動撮合的，如娶進者爲鄉下黃臉大姐，那就即是美·即是可愛·也必成了不美與不可愛而必欲　開的。這，我有幾位仁兄都是如此，只有一個南友，他是那麽誠誠實實，陶醉在美人窠的大學裏，却總向我們誇贊他的留鄉的老婆，這點，眞使我們五體投地的拜服他。</p>
<p>最後，雖然談的不大正經，却是男女戀愛上的眞諦。</p>
<h3>大學生的危機</h3>
<p>— 歹刀</p>
<p>因爲社會的黑暗混亂，累得大學生没有出路，因爲大學生没有出路，於是頗有人論列大學生的危機，最得勁的有下述兩種的說法。</p>
<p>第一是說現在已到了知識階級的没落季代，大學生雖是學貫中西，很能順應潮流；但究竟他們的社會基礎已經崩坍，僅僅戴着方帽子，已無法施其權威。而况舊的意識還是那麽濃厚，擺不脫前時代的士大夫的氣習。其實士大夫到了今日已比士大夫還不如了。瞧啦：在這沸期資本主義的上海社會裏，有些小販，運用着機巧，每天撈得上三五元的進賬至若理髮匠，茶房侍役，他們的生活，眞是優而裕之。一個大學畢業生還要會跑會跳能拍能吹才能找得一個小職位—機關職員或中小學敎書匠，念三十元一月的高薪，還要靠時代太平點，才不遭「節流」「折扣」之若，這，當然是啞子吃黃連的味兒。儘管你頭上頂的是學士帽，滿肚子的公式，哲理，科學，藝術，社會是不大會把你放在眼裏的，儘管你的身分像天高地厚，社會是不會尊重你的，時代已指定知識階級的大學生向死的道路出發，談不到出路。</p>
<p>第二便是說大學生名望雖高，外觀雖美，却多是「金玉其外敗絮其中」的朋友，没有實際本領。研究數理的全不懂國文，甚至連一封普通的信都寫不清順，研究文學的，竟說國文不及格，一個一次方程式的代數簡題，也演習不出。總之，樣樣僅曉得一點皮毛，在學時，不賣力，根基全無，離開校門，又是那麽孤傲不凡，发像事事幹得了，幹起來，才知是應付不易，還不虚心請益，一味的自行其是。以致機關衙門，見了大學生，却之惟恐不遠。從此大學生便呌起屈來，其實何嘗是寃屈，是應付碰的鋼釘，大學生本身的不健全，實是一切危機的致命傷。</p>
<p>這兩種說法，亦自有其道理，固然，知識階級的没落，大發生本身之貧乏，我們都相當的承認。但這却還不是大學生的頂中危機所在，也不是當前的大學生没有出路，只有暗礁的唯一原因。那麽大學生的危機是什麽呢？簡切的一句是：「慾望的高漲」，我們看，目前的一般大學生，對於生活的認識與要求是怎樣的情形。</p>
<p>任憑窮到連學費都發生恐慌，外觀的衣飾是必要那麽考究，很少能認識得清，這原與做學没有多大的關係。講到食，更是那麽刁巧，學堂裏的飯，好像裏面有毒，必要洗袋子到館子裏去大嚼大嚥，我磁過許多大學生，他們是不進小館子的，就是口袋裏只賸得幾毛車費了，也必要送到西菜社才放得下心。住，學校的宿舍，太擠，最好在校外自己賃租，寗願天遠地遠的每天來往，說是住得舒服一些。我們知道慾望是無底止的，它是「旣高猶漲」天天向上爬的，從大學一年級到四年級，看得分明，是大有差别，没有人肯回頭看看後面跟着的苦命朋友，是怎樣的在挨餓受凍。</p>
<p>在校的時候，慾望已是這樣高漲，出校就業，自然也就眼界格外的高了，事情太機械欠舒服的不幹，代價太低微的不幹，名望欠佳的不幹。但對生活的要求却越發高漲起來了，衣食住行都要舒而服之，袋裏本是精光，不妨東拉西借。三等電車雖是那麽空，犯不着挨進去丢身分，要坐在頭等車裏蹺足歪頭，才是舒服。</p>
<p>這些，固然是萬惡的現社會，資本化的大學敎育所孕育反映出來的；但我想大學生當非一般人可比，旣有高深的學識，總得有正確的認識，怎麽這樣同流合汚，做一頭社會的應聲虫，而不去改造社會，創造環境？這眞是大學生的危機！要想大學生有出路，一半固然要靠整個的社會翻身，但一半也要靠自己從速猛省，認清自己的危機，滌蕩自己的弱點，站在時代的前面，去努力奮鬥，我想出路是有的，决不如現在的黑漆一團。</p>
<h3>僵蠅</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>星期六的晚上，我獨自一個靜悄悄地在伏案寫信，忽然不知怎的一個小蟲落到我筆端上面停住了，搖之一動，驅之不響，我提起筆來一看，原來是我親愛的久别的芝蔴蠅，啊，久别了，蠅將軍，你怎麽憔悴到了這般地步呢？你昔日光明的雙翅呢？你昔日雄壯的營營的歌音呢？你昔日快樂活潑的豐姿呢？啊，你怎麽消瘦到了這般地步啊！你怎麽僵木到了這般地步啊！</p>
<p>那芝蔴蠅雖然僵伏着，可是他的喙郤仍在不住地活動着，在吮吸筆頭上的墨汁。蠅將軍，儘量的吮吸罷，我雖然窮，郤也不至吝惜這些墨計的。如果墨計不夠你的胃口，那末，牀頭我還有剩餘的花生糖，抽屜中還有滿缸的洋蜜糖。如果這些都能使你恢復昔日的健康的話，我是决計不會吝惜的。</p>
<p>我於是把我們那半僵的蠅將軍送到糖菓罐中，又送到蜜糖缸中；蠅將軍拚命地吸着拚命地吮着，喙的活　更迅速了，埀死的蠅將軍似乎又有「復活」的現象了，我非常地快樂，我暗地替我們的蠅將軍祈禱祝福。</p>
<p>蠅將軍似乎飽了，可是牠仍戀戀地不肯棄去甜蜜的瓦缸，蠅將軍，你有甚麽心事麽？你莫非想起了你夫人蚊姑娘了麽？</p>
<p>不要緊的，你儘飛去把蚊夫人去接來好了，假如蜜糖汁和花生糖不能使蚊夫人過癮，那末我全身還滿蓄着久未被吸的血，我的不夠，還有我弟弟妹妹姊姊哥哥的，多着呢，你儘去接來好了。</p>
<p>啊，怎麽不動呢？你别誤僵我的意思，我並不懷着報復的惡意。雖然夏天裏我因喝你的毒淔患了霍亂症幾乎送命，雖然前二月爲你的蚊夫人在我身上佈放了Malaria的細菌，害我生了寒熱病，可是這些事情我决不會和將軍合蚊太太計較，我深深地明白我們的地位，我們的汗，我們的血是應當供給代們吮吸的，這是我們應盡的義務啊！</p>
<p>唔，蠅將軍，怎麽儘是不動不響呢？莫非你的同伴合蚊夫人們都死了麽？你傷感了麽？啊，那我没有辦法了，我們有的是血是汗，可以供你們的吮吸，人間郤没有方法可治你的相思病的。大概你們的末日已經到了，末日，怎麽再能夠以我們的血和汗來挽回呢？</p>
<p>果然，那位「碩果僅存」的蠅將軍不久竟在蜜糖缸内一命嗚呼了，我爲之嘆息不久。</p>
<p>當是時，桌上攤着一本雷馬克的西線無戰事，有幾句話突的跳入我的眼簾：</p>
<p>「……人本身也是個野獸昆蟲，不過他會像麫包上塗牛油似的塗上一點禮貌罷了。」</p>
<p>於是我惘然了。我怕我們的末日也在不遠了。</p>

<h3>我有三分像考爾門</h3>
<p>— 平人</p>
<p>戲院子裏的　還亮着，銀幕上的愛的羅曼斯還不曾出映；但，滿座來看所謂情聖考爾門的少爺小姐們的臉色都已微微地紅暈了，像如有了三分酒意。這，是情聖考爾門五個字的不可捉携的魔力。</p>
<p>「假如我是考爾門，滿院子的女人都愛了我……」我這樣子滑稽地想了起來。也許，滿院子的少爺們都作如是想的吧？我不必打自己的腦袋了！</p>
<p>「假如滿院子的男人全是考爾門那麽可愛的，而又完全是愛着我的話…………」我以爲滿院子的小姐都在這樣子暗自思忖的——祇少，坐在我右肩的這一位漂亮小姐，瞧她微紅的臉蛋兒上的神情，瞧她眉尖頭上表現着的内心的情緒，我以爲，她是那樣子暗自思忖着的。</p>
<p>不知終究是甚麽作用，我竟對她笑了起來。</p>
<p>「你笑得眞像考爾門；實在，你看考爾門的戲太多了，所以受了他的影響！」跟我同來看戲的王先生說笑似的說着，那位漂亮小姐竟睨着我的臉笑了起來。</p>
<p>她跟她的同伴在說：「眞是點兒考爾門的味道！」</p>
<p>什麽？一個人的風度在她嘴裏就變成一種滋味了嗎？「考爾門是甜的還是酸的？」我自語着，目的不過是學着所謂「幽默」地駡人而已，說我是想勾引她實在是寃枉的。</p>
<p>可是我終究勾引了她了；她笑出了「格吱……格吱」的微聲來，對她的同伴說：「他自己還不知道自家兒的味道是香是臭哩！」引得那個青年婦人大聲笑了。</p>
<p>我正在大爲不適的時候，那個青年婦人又說了：「像如我們在什麽地方見過他的？」</p>
<p>見鬼！誰曾跟你們見過，——不過，也許大家常常看電影而眼熟了吧？</p>
<p>我的朋友王先生，他可聰明透了：「是的，是上一個片子，也坐在一起時」，竟隨便亂說起來。</p>
<p>「不！是兩個月之前在大光明看瑙瑪希拉的片子碰見過的；他還給她拾過一方手絹，後來她常常說你有三分像考爾門……」那青年婦人低頭笑了。</p>
<p>「不要瞎說！」她隨口說着又是一笑。</p>
<p>噢！這使我想起來了，那天她曾在看完片子之後問我瑙瑪希拉的眼睛好看不好看，我一時給驚奇的情緒弄昏了，没有回答她而祇對她笑了一笑——可不知這一笑有三分像考爾門不？</p>
<p>「我們眼熟得很……」這樣子，我開始對她說了，「兩位小姐不會見怪的吧，我們談談。」</p>
<p>「那末，瑙瑪希拉的眼睛好看不好看看？」</p>
<p>「嗯——很好看，不過你的眼睛比」她更美，更活靈些？」</p>
<p>那青年婦人又大聲地笑，簡直是可怕的；她跟着輕微地笑——這不用說，是迷人的了。</p>
<p>「那末，你以爲考爾門是甜的還是酸的？」</p>
<p>我没有答覆，那個青年婦人竟伸過頭來，在我耳邊說了：「你給她嘗嘗滋味吧，是香的還是臭的，同時，你也可以嘗嘗她的味道是酸是甜？」跟着又笑，又是大聲地，引得前排的座客都回顧了頭來。</p>
<p>呵！這個，太荒唐了！我想。</p>
<p>「不要是賣淫的吧？」王先生又警機地咬着我的耳邊說。</p>
<p>「本來，我那兒有一點像考爾門，你眞胡閙！」</p>

<h3>上海（三十一）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（四十四）拖一條尾巴</p>
<p>今年三月，恭喜榮任了上海公報的附刊「公話」編輯。「公話」的意思，想說幾句硬綳綳的話，起初就抓住幾個人來開過刀；可是報館中發生了不幸事件，爲了老板的前途，爲了自己的飯碗，勢不能再做切頭工作，於是學一個時髦名字「轉變」，「國家事，管牠娘！」「莫談國事，祇談風月，」就在這時候被人認爲摸過女人屁股，其實我壓根兒不知女人的屁股是圓是方？雖然薰風飄蕩着的上海的夏天，在蟬翼般的喬其紗旗衫下，「略窺一二」，終因爲「衣服裏住了身體」而「未窺全豹」。</p>
<p>「上海」—原名春天的上海—也在這時候陸續寫一些下來預備繼續未完篇的「詩概」，可是窮人的命運終究不濟，「上海」没有寫完，因爲報館的混亂時期而辭退出來，然而這些寫下來的「癩痢頭兒子」總希望變幾個錢。所以我不瞞天，不瞞地，寫稿子無非爲了七錢三，東西的好壞在自己却並不在乎的，不過我理想中把某一個人物寫成某一種典型，這一點自由權尙操在這枝破筆底下。至於意識和出路等等，那我更管不了許多；或者以後向我的朋友（借用）凌鶴先生討敎這一套之後再來騙幾文錢。</p>
<p>「上海」完了。上半多我將舊稿稍稍修改過，後半每天在播音室裏塗下來的，更因年底將近，怱怱結果，漏洞破綻，不一而足（技巧問題根本談不到）希望要抓人來開刀的朋友筆下留情。「上海」完了，除我每天留下一張本刊之外，「上海」已和我脫離關係；所以要拖一條尾巴，是爲了一封信。</p>
<p>那封信寄來的時候，徐慧琴小姐正在扮演一位「都市的姑娘」，幸而一路下來，徐小姐並没有變成一位使人側目的人物，擔心徐小姐的先生（？）可以放心了。不過我想說一句傻話，如其讀了一篇小說而替小說中的人物擔心，那也太勞神了。於是我聰明起來，一定「徐慧琴」三個字發生了問題，不過傻話終是傻話，不見徐炳南恰是徐小姐的尊大人，再退一萬步說，那徐家匯的方外别墅總不見再有這般巧事。</p>
<p>我記不起了一本看過的小說，因爲被人索隱，作者滑稽地聲明，不能爲了書中某一個人寫得太卑鄙，就以爲那「某」指着自己，要是你這樣一想，已自認一個卑鄙的人了。我將這幾句話來結束我的尾巴罷。完了，上海，完了，尾巴。　　　　　　　十二·二七·於新聲播音室。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ulanqab and Yunmeng League leaders telegraphed Wu Heling of the Mongolian Office in Beijing, stating that Minister Huang had returned to Beijing for more than a month, and there was no news about whether the Central Government would immediately issue a decree to announce the establishment of an autonomous government. The Mongolian flags are becoming increasingly suspicious and hope that you will lead the representatives of our leagues to appeal to the Central Government and Huang Zhao for everything so that the autonomous region government can be established as soon as possible. Wang De came to the meeting a few days ago and said that the Japanese had sent troops to set up a radio station at his League Leader's Office (that is, the Ujumqin Banner, where the Silingol League Leader is located), the Mongolian affair is tense, and the future is worrying. He has asked Wang De to send representatives to Beijing as soon as possible. De agreed to discuss the Mongolian League Leader and immediately sent representatives to the south, and planned to have Wang De formulate various rules for the establishment of the autonomous region government to suit our Mongolian old rules and telegraph the central authorities to request adoption. After this telegram arrives, I hope to help promote it. Even if it is difficult to obtain adoption, I hope that the Central Government will refer to our Mongolian customs and consider it in detail. Now the border situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and traffic in Mongolia is often blocked. In the event of an emergency, there is no way to convey it. At the end of the month, Qiuchen Buddha moved the Zhao Yimeng radio station away, so our alliance's communication of news is even more delayed. I hope that you will quickly ask the Central Government to issue our alliance with a 100-watt radio station for reporting to the Central Government at any time in the event of a confidential accident.

<h3>The Call for Abolishing Exorbitant Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies (England)</h3>
<p>Recently, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, in his capacity as Chairman of the Rural Reconstruction Commission of the Executive Yuan, telegraphed all provinces, cities, counties, and people's organizations across the country, requesting detailed reports on the names and amounts of various taxes and levies in their respective localities. This was to facilitate collation, verification, and the convening of relevant agencies to discuss methods for abolishing and streamlining them, thereby alleviating the people's hardships and gradually enriching their livelihoods. At a time when the nation is facing economic decline and both internal and external troubles are pressing, it is gratifying that the government authorities are aware of the root causes of the people's suffering and are seeking to abolish these most disruptive exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. It is said that the policy of abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies is a vital national plan of our government. The government has previously promulgated clear orders for implementation. Later, before the purification of the party, a committee for improving taxes and levies was established. The order to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in Shandong upon completion of this task shows that the government's intention to start anew with the people did not begin today. However, in recent years, the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies throughout the country have become even more numerous and disruptive than before the fifteenth year of the Republic. Is this due to difficulties in implementation, or to ineffective enforcement of orders by those responsible? Or is it due to the country's frequent troubles and repeated internal strife, leaving no time for this? Some argue that today, our country's mountains and rivers are fragmented, society is unstable, and both urban and rural areas lack vitality. The biggest problem is the invasion of foreign economic forces. Therefore, if the government authorities sincerely want to save the people's livelihood, they should first focus on this. However, I believe that abolishing these exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes is precisely to increase our people's ability to resist the invasion of foreign forces. Therefore, the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies should be implemented swiftly with a firm and sincere attitude. If it must first be preceded by a detailed investigation, followed by streamlining and verification, and then convening meetings for leisurely discussion, I fear that delays will lead to disappointment and turn it into a bubble.</p>
<p>Today's so-called exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies have tax names and goods classifications that vary widely from place to place. There are taxes on bamboo and wood, and taxes on chickens and ducks. The tax-collecting agencies are often layered upon layered. The province collects, the county government collects, the town market collects, and the stationed troops also collect. The extent of the burden on the people can be said to have reached its limit. It is imperative to conduct a very detailed investigation. However, the ultimate burden of these taxes, in reality, mostly falls on the general poor and helpless common people across the country, while the few wealthy individuals in urban and rural areas remain unaffected. The taxpayer is the consumer himself, of course. However, most of the taxpayers are merchants engaged in buying and selling, factory owners who purchase raw materials, and wealthy people who manage land. In fact, they can all pass on the entire amount of the taxes they pay to the consumers. And the general consumers have no choice but to swallow their anger and let them exploit them. Even if the merchants and the wealthy cannot raise prices excessively, they rarely suffer losses. Even if the burden of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies hinders their business development, it is still a secondary issue among the various socio-economic problems today. Therefore, the harm of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies to society and the people is so great, how can the abolition be delayed? Now the authorities are advocating a fresh start with the people, and do not hesitate to speak out about reform because the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are important sources of revenue for the local authorities. It cannot be said that it is not the good fortune of the common people. It is hoped that the government authorities can muster their courage and accomplish this with all their strength. Do not just offer empty words of kindness, and remain like the past, leaving future generations to reminisce. Then it may be possible.</p>

<p>Important Diplomatic Speeches by American and Russian Leaders</p>
<p>Both Call for Peace</p>
<p>Roosevelt Declares No Ambition to Covet the Territory of Other Countries</p>
<p>Molotov Expresses Willingness to Be Friendly to Japan, But Must Be Wary</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's New Declaration</h3>
<p>Holds No Ambition to Expand Territory</p>
<p>Opposes Any Military Intervention</p>
<p>Willing to Work with the League of Nations</p>
<p>To Promote the Welfare of the World's Nations</p>
<p>(Washington) Today is the birthday of former President Wilson. President Roosevelt delivered an important speech on American diplomacy at the board meeting of the "Wilson Foundation," stating that the United States will never invade the land of others in the future, and opposes any interference in the affairs of Latin American countries. He then praised the achievements of Secretary of State Hull at the Pan-American Conference, saying that wars are caused by the rulers of countries, not by the people. Former President Wilson made many efforts to promote mutual understanding among the nations of the world. Wilson once declared that the United States no longer coveted an inch of the territory of other countries. The United States has regarded this declaration as a guiding principle. Wilson's declaration was even more important when he expressed his views to the Latin American countries, saying that human freedom should not be exploited for material interests. It is a pity that this frank policy failed to achieve its full effect due to the impact of the European War. Today, I dare to issue a new declaration in addition to Wilson's declaration in my capacity as President, stating that the United States' policy opposes any military intervention in the future. "The constitutional government of other countries must be maintained. The United States does not bear the obligation. If chaos occurs in other countries on the American continent, its impact will affect the entire continent, not just one country." The reason why the Pan-American Conference in the capital of Uruguay was so successful is that the countries of the Americas were able to understand this theory, and not only the authorities of each country, but also the people of each country deeply understood this meaning. At this time, the thinking of the nations of the Americas is very good. Shortsighted people believe that Wilson's plans have failed. This erroneous view originates from the national ideas of the people, but the blame for threatening peace should be attributed to the authorities of each country, not to the people of each country. Roosevelt continued, "Wilson's call to the world to abolish war was met with joy by the people of all countries. However, the politicians, or self-proclaimed politicians, who gathered in Paris in 1919 to negotiate the peace treaty mostly regarded Wilson's application as a mere formality, focusing on national political interests, personal prestige, and national expansion. The League of Nations was born in this bad atmosphere. Fortunately, the League of Nations has made many contributions since its establishment. When countries encounter disputes, they all directly or indirectly rely on it to seek better solutions. Most diplomatic negotiations are given the opportunity to proceed by the League of Nations. The League of Nations has also made efforts in formulating plans for health, commerce, education, and other undertakings. Large and small countries rely on it to resolve disputes, regardless of size. The United States is cooperating with the League of Nations openly, more so now than at any other time. The League of Nations is the mainstay of world peace. Although the United States is not a member country and does not want to join the League of Nations, the United States will fully cooperate with its efforts to protect the lives and promote the welfare of all nations of the world." Roosevelt then said that 10% of the people in the world threaten others and are feared by the other 90%. Roosevelt also recalled the various proposals made by the League of Nations to the world, among which universal disarmament and the abandonment of armed aggression were the most important. He concluded, "All these benevolent proposals have unfortunately failed. The political leaders of various countries gathered in Geneva justified their mistakes with ridiculous reasons. Although these people speak in the name of the people, they are not enough to represent the people. I dare to say to these people that if the people of the world can speak directly, then the agreement to jointly maintain peace in the world can be concluded immediately. The war of 1914 and the wars in history before that were all caused by the governments of various countries and had nothing to do with the people. We dare to use Wilson's words to tell the world. What are his words? That is, from now on, the rulers of various countries are not allowed to cause wars, but the people of various countries are allowed to establish peace themselves."

<h3>Good Impression in Cuba</h3>
<p>Havana Yesterday was the birthday of the late President Wilson. President Roosevelt delivered a speech, repeatedly reiterating the policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries. This speech has had a warm impression on the Cuban government. President Samartan recently issued a declaration praising Roosevelt, saying that the Cuban government and people fully agree with President Roosevelt's statement that "armed intervention is the root of disputes and can cause countries to compete with each other."

<h3>Molotov Explains the International Position of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Firmly Declares that Soviet Russia Aims at Peace</p>
<p>But is Also Prepared to Cope with the Danger of Being Attacked</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union met yesterday. People's Commissar Chairman Molotov reported on the plan for developing the Soviet Union's national economy in 1934 to enthusiastic applause. At the end of the report, Molotov discussed the Soviet Union's international position, saying,</p>
<h3>The Greatest Success of US-Russia Hand-in-Hand Diplomacy</h3>
<p>"The year 1933 was a year in which the Soviet Union's international position was further consolidated. The facts have already stated this for themselves. The resumption of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States was the greatest success of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. The motivation for this came from Roosevelt. This is well known. The Soviet government immediately accepted this motivation. Thus, the artificial obstacles to diplomatic relations between the two largest countries (we cannot blame anyone for the existence of these obstacles) were finally eliminated. And the warm welcome given by the American people to Litvinov has shown to what extent this resumption of diplomatic relations has satisfied the essential requirements and deep desires of the Soviet Union and the United States. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is based on an agreement. This agreement is fully in line with the principles of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Now that diplomatic relations have been established, the development of trade and economic relations will be able to proceed more smoothly."</p>
<h3>The Center of Policy is to Strive for Peace</h3>
<p>Molotov stressed, "Under the current international situation, it is particularly important that the establishment of this relationship will have a huge and beneficial impact on the stability of international relations and the consolidation of world peace. In this regard, we must recognize that the Soviet government's resolutely implemented foreign policy has achieved important successes. The issue of fighting for world peace in the past and present is also the center of our attention. This struggle to win peace and the struggle against the rising tide of imperialist war will be able to accommodate not only the deepest wishes of the Soviet Union but also the deepest wishes of the people of other countries. We have no doubt about this. The Soviet government is strengthening its struggle for peace in various ways as the elements promoting the rising tide of imperialist war are increasing in international relations, as this situation is driven by the frantic increase in armaments and military budgets, and as the work of preparing for a new war is being carried out in many places before everyone's eyes, regardless of the fact that the ruling groups of some countries are promoting their aggressive attempts."</p>
<h3>No Worries in the West, Mutually Concluded Non-Aggression Pacts</h3>
<p>Molotov continued, "Soviet diplomacy has achieved important victories this year. Soviet diplomacy has gloriously completed the following tasks, namely, openly and resolutely exposing aggressive imperialist forces, opposing them with clear proposals, and denouncing their attempts to resolve international disputes by armed force. Everyone should recall that the disarmament conference's delay in resolving this issue did not prevent us from concluding a pact defining aggressor countries with several neighboring countries, namely Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan. These victories of Soviet diplomacy are inextricably linked to Litvinov's fame. His achievements are well known to the general public, but I must specifically state them here (long applause). I expect that the entire audience will welcome the following suggestion, namely, that Litvinov should make a more detailed report on this issue of international government (applause)."</p>
<h3>Maintaining Friendship and Cooperation with Italy, France, Poland, and Turkey</h3>
<p>Molotov continued, "In its relations with other countries, the Soviet government has resolutely implemented its tested principles of peace and its policy of practical cooperation. The clearest example of this is our relationship with Turkey. During Turkey's tenth anniversary, the Soviet government sent a delegation headed by Voroshilov to Turkey. At the same time, this friendly country gave the delegation a very warm welcome. These facts are sufficient to demonstrate the stability of Soviet-Turkish relations and its political significance. At this time, I should mention that the development of commercial and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and Poland has achieved new and more favorable conditions than before. We have always attached great political significance to this. Practical cooperation between the Soviet Union and France has progressed smoothly. The visit of French dignitaries to the Soviet Union and the establishment of closer and more commercial contacts between the two countries have made it easier to develop this cooperation. We believe that Soviet-French cooperation has entered a new stage and will have good results in the future. Finally, we have concluded a treaty of non-aggression, neutrality, and friendship with Italy. At the same time, at the initiative of Spain and Uruguay, we have established diplomatic relations with them. These are also clear examples of the Soviet Union's development of diplomatic relations with other countries."</p>
<h3>Relations with Britain Improve After Deteriorating Once</h3>
<p>"On the contrary, our relations with Britain deteriorated briefly this year. For obvious reasons, the Soviet government could not agree to a policy of using external force to suppress our internal affairs. At the same time, it was able to maintain its position throughout this incident. This deterioration was caused by the trial of the Vickers company saboteurs. It was soon eliminated. Normal commercial negotiations are now underway in London."</p>
<h3>Safeguarding Peace, the Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>"Soviet-German relations have always occupied a special position in our country's international relations. The Soviet Union's commitment to the principles of safeguarding world peace and our country's independence has no reason to change its policy towards Germany. However, the rulers of Germany have repeatedly tried to change their relationship with the Soviet Union this year. Clear-headed people can easily see this tendency. At this time, we do not need to describe in detail the statements made by Luxembourg, Hugenberg, and other people. They have been fully described in writing and orally in this country. One thing that we can clearly see is that until recently, the friendship between the Soviet Union and Germany was based on the mutual desire for peace and the development of economic relations. Even today, we absolutely remain committed to these principles. We believe that only by pursuing these principles can we create the power of political and economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany and the power to seek world peace. However, the leaders of the militaristic national socialist ideology, such as Luxembourg, are the opposite. Their policies are entirely permeated by reactionary desires and imperialist plundering plans. Therefore, they are incompatible with every consolidation and friendship of the Soviet Union. We also believe that this policy is incompatible with Germany's great future."</p>
<h3>It is Not Enough to Speak of Goodwill with Japan, Whose Cunning Cannot Be Hidden</h3>
<p>"As for our relations with Japan, they have been discussed in great detail. The Soviet government's policy on this point is clear to those outside the Soviet Union. We initially requested the conclusion of a non-aggression pact, agreed to sell the Middle East Railway, and dealt with various commercial issues, such as the issue of Japan's privileges in the Far East, with a sincere attitude. These facts are well known to everyone. At the same time, no one can ask us to provide greater evidence of our peaceful intentions. However, all this has not prevented some Japanese newspapers and Japanese officials from fabricating various dirty rumors every day, claiming that the Soviet Union has aggressive intentions. One day they issued a message saying that the Soviet Union's political police attacked the Manchurian border. The next day they said that Moscow sent people to China to organize anti-Japanese movements, etc. They issue more rumors every day. The purpose of this action is nothing more than to cover up the anti-Soviet Union and anti-Soviet provocations of their agents. The most reactionary military personnel in Japan are particularly afraid of the establishment of considerable cooperation between the Soviet Union, the United States, and China to deal with the elements that initiate hostilities in the Far East, given their own increasing isolation. They exaggerate the possibility of this kind of cooperation, and at the same time, they expose themselves by denying the rumors they have fabricated in a panic. They are extremely afraid of the Soviet Union's huge growth. At the same time, they lose their confidence and declare with an even more stubborn attitude "This is the time!" All the above is sufficient to show that they cannot be indifferent to the danger of equality for war and aggression. Is there a need to state this matter for our meaning now? What we need to state here has already been said. Our task is to continue to implement the peace policy in the Far East unyieldingly and improve our relations with Japan. At the same time, we must be fully prepared to cope with possible attacks and disturbances. As far as the current situation is concerned, we are sincerely and unfortunately still unable to guarantee that we can avoid these attacks and disturbances."</p>
<h3>Germany and Japan Have Different Intentions in Withdrawing from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>"The so-called danger of a new war is particularly certain this year, as evidenced by the following facts: Germany and Japan have both approved their withdrawal from the League of Nations. Germany's move is clearly related to its desire to expand its armaments. It considers participation in the League of Nations as one of the obstacles to expanding its armaments. When Japan informed the international community of its withdrawal, it stated that it wanted to maintain its complete freedom to intervene in China. Even the League of Nations, to some extent, allows the interventionists the freedom to act. However, it must also be recognized that the fact that the League of Nations has a certain hindering effect on the forces of military expansion is a favorable fact. No matter how different the reasons for withdrawing from the League of Nations are, what we need to consider is the following fact, namely, that these important events cannot help consolidate world peace. On the contrary, they can allow the most reactionary and aggressive forces to run wild. Therefore, we must safeguard peace more resolutely and systematically. At the same time, we must use the various opportunities that exist to expose all attempts to promote new imperialist wars and new aggressive actions against the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>Gathering the Power of Workers and Peasants to Awaken the Imperial Dreams</h3>
<p>"Our most important task is to inform the working masses of the Soviet Union's true position in the current capitalist environment. Therefore, the basic facts that threaten peace, as well as the facts that can promote our peace policy and world peace, should be accurately informed to the broad masses of workers and peasants. The ruling classes of capitalist countries have never been able and will never be able to inform their people of the actual situation of their respective countries and the actual foreign policies of their respective governments. This is even more difficult for the gentlemen in the reactionary fascist camp. They are still entangled in the dreams of imperialist plunder. Therefore, they will ultimately insist on the attitude that their heads can be cut off but this policy cannot be changed. Only the Soviet government, which is most supported by the workers and peasants, firmly believes that developing the conscious attitude of the masses towards peace is its greatest task and obligation. This is where our greatest strength lies at this time. When the workers and peasants understand what the purpose of their struggle is, what they are working for, striving for, and sacrificing for, then they will never be afraid of difficulties and will become an irresistible force (enthusiastic applause). It is with unwavering faith that we Bolsheviks move forward bravely (enthusiastic applause)." (29th Tass Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Stalin Discusses the Crisis in Japanese-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>Friendship Cannot Be Achieved Alone</p>
<p>Japan Will Only Bring Trouble Upon Itself if It Does Not Change Its Attitude</p>
<p>(New York) Today's New York Times published a conversation between Soviet Russia's Stalin and its Moscow correspondent, saying that Stalin has clearly declared that Japan is a real danger to the Soviet Union. Stalin's words said, "I think it would be most unwise for Japan to attempt to attack the Soviet Union at this time. However, our country must be prepared for the worst. We want to have friendly relations with the Japanese. Unfortunately, this is not something that our country can achieve unilaterally. If more rational elements can gain power in Japan and make more cautious suggestions, then the two countries will be able to coexist peacefully. I am afraid that Japan's warlords will force the more sober policies to retreat. Therefore, there is a serious danger at the moment. We cannot but prepare to deal with it." In addition, Stalin also said that the Soviet Union will support the League of Nations in maintaining world peace and wants to increase trade relations with other countries. As for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, Stalin said that they are a sales market and are also prepared to order a large amount of foreign goods and pay for them. The Soviet Union's repayment of debts at this time is surprising to everyone. But the Soviet Union is able to repay its debts. He knows that non-repayment of debts is everywhere today, but other countries may default on their debts, while the Soviet Union will not default. The Soviet Union has a very rich gold reserve, and the amount of mining is increasing day by day. It has now mined more than 100 million rubles, more than double the gold production of the Imperial Russian era." According to reports, Stalin rarely speaks and rarely meets with foreign journalists. Therefore, this conversation is extremely noticed by Americans. (29th Kuomintang Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan's Ambition Unabated</h3>
<p>Plotting to Annex Eastern Mongolia</p>
<p>London Hears News with Great Alarm</p>
<p>(London) News from Tokyo indicates that Japan plans to annex a portion of Mongolia into "Manchukuo," claiming that Eastern Mongolia originally belonged to Manchuria and its return is a matter of course. People here are greatly alarmed upon learning of this. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Closely Monitor US Navy's Active Strategy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Naval authorities, regarding the US Navy's plan to build 102 new ships, have not issued any comments, as it is within treaty limits. However, if the US Navy completes its planned construction of five ships and the 32 ships under the National Industrial Recovery Act, Japan's auxiliary vessel ratio to the US in 1936 will be 76%. If the construction of these 102 ships is realized, the ratio to the US will further decrease to 62%. Therefore, they are closely monitoring the US Navy's active strategy. (Dentsu, 29th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Dispute Over the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Russian-Puppet Confrontation Intensifies</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, local newspapers all carried a headline: "Reply to Shameless Swindlers." The article contains a letter from Zhang Wuqi, the puppet deputy director of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), to the director, Rudy. In the letter, Zhang stated that he could not agree with the various instructions issued by Rudy and that he could not obey Rudy's orders. Rudy replied, "My orders and instructions are valid for all railway personnel serving on the railway or in the bureau, as well as for the Soviet and Manchukuo deputy directors. I order you to carry out your work within the scope of authority and obligations stipulated by current rules, and to cease communications on topics outside of your duties." (TASS, 28th)</p>
<p>Harbin reports that the confrontation between Russia and the puppet government over the CER issue is becoming increasingly acute. Soviet cadres believe that a certain CER case is the result of the puppet side's abuse of judicial power. Recently, Consul General Slyozkin visited Shi, the representative of the puppet Foreign Ministry, and presented a lengthy protest regarding the CER. The content was not published, but it is said to include issues such as the acting heads of departments and sections in the vacancies, non-recognition of any interference by "Manchukuo" in the CER, and insistence on the absolute authority of the director of the administration, with fairly strong language. After the above protest was made, Director Router immediately cancelled the appointment of the assistant at Puqitu Station appointed by "Manchukuo." (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>India Increases Tariffs, Japan Protests</h3>

<h3>France Threatens to Expose German Military Secrets</h3>
<p>Poncet to Return to Berlin with Reply</p>
<p>Seeking Compromise Based on Anglo-French Agreement</p>
<p>Disarmament Negotiations Must Take Place in Geneva</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news from here today, the French government plans to publish a secret document at the League of Nations meeting, which is likely to cause great international shock. It is now believed that this document concerns Germany's military strength and other miscellaneous matters. French Ambassador to Germany Poncet arrived here today from Berlin and plans to carry back to Germany the French government's reply to Hitler's proposal for direct negotiations on disarmament and the Saar issue. It is heard that France's policy aims to reach a compromise in Geneva based on the plan agreed upon by French Foreign Minister Pong and British Foreign Minister Simon in September of this year. If Germany rejects this plan, France intends to reveal Germany's secrets before the League of Nations Council meeting. The French reply rejects direct Franco-German meetings and declares that France advocates disarmament but not rearmament, and advocates discussions in Geneva but not elsewhere. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Ambassador to Germany Poncet returned here this morning. At 3 p.m., he met with Foreign Minister Pong. The Foreign Minister gave Poncet the instructions passed by yesterday's cabinet meeting. These instructions are in response to Germany's request for rearmament. In addition to the instructions, there are also other useful explanations attached. Poncet plans to rush back to Berlin to attend the diplomatic reception on New Year's Day. As for the French government's memorandum to German Chancellor Hitler, it is planned to be delivered after the New Year holidays on January 4th or 5th. Foreign Minister Pong also met with the Soviet and Polish ambassadors to France today. The purpose of the meeting was probably to inform the two ambassadors of the cabinet meeting's decisions regarding Franco-German relations and the outline of the memorandum to Hitler. In addition to the two ambassadors, Pong also met with U.S. Ambassador to Russia Bullitt. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French cabinet has already drafted a memorandum on Germany's demand for rearmament and handed it over to Ambassador Poncet for delivery to the German government. The content of this memorandum is still unknown. It is generally believed that the French government considers Germany's various demands to be completely contrary to the disarmament conference. The French government believes that international security can only be built within the scope of the League of Nations and through the means of reducing armaments. The French government also intends to resubmit the proposals decided upon during the talks with Britain on September 23rd and 24th, namely that once a general disarmament convention is signed, the French government will propose to reduce the number of bomber aircraft by half, but only on the condition that other related countries also make the same promise.

Tyrell explained to the Belgian Foreign Minister the outline of the British reply to Germany's proposals. The so-called German proposals are those recently put forward by German Foreign Minister Neurath during his meeting with the British Ambassador to Germany. The gist of the British reply is that Britain believes that negotiations on disarmament should continue within the scope of the League of Nations. The amount of German troops should also be calculated according to the numbers listed in the League of Nations Yearbook, and the numbers listed in the plan submitted by Britain to the Disarmament Conference should be used as the basis.

<h3>Hymans Makes Statement After Meeting with French Authorities</h3>
<p>(Paris) After meeting with French authorities, Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans made a statement to the press, saying that the talks were very frank and cordial, avoiding all formalities. Foreign Minister Pong and Premier Xu had specially studied the disarmament issue with him. Hymans particularly stated on this point that Belgium's greatest concern is to find ways to avoid competition in disarmament, because competition in armaments will make it difficult to restore international credit and economic activity, and the end result will inevitably lead to a major war, the situation of which will be far more terrifying than the European War of 1914. The danger is that the hearts of Britain and Italy to avoid it, it is presumed that it is no less than France and Belgium. Belgium, as one of the countries most threatened by war, regards the disarmament issue as a matter of national survival, so it sincerely hopes that the negotiations conducted by the countries can reach a basis for compromise, so that the disarmament conference can continue to be beneficial work and can establish an international compromise to prevent the competition of armaments and increase the guarantee of peace.</p>
<p>Hymans also said that small countries like Belgium are all attached to the League of Nations, thinking that even if the League of Nations can not but have changes, then the various principles contained in the covenant should be maintained, and especially the equality of countries in law. Finally, talking about economic issues, Hymans said that he hopes that France's new policy of import quantity restrictions can increase trade between the two countries. Hymans also said that since the economic organizations of France and Belgium are both the same, and have strictly adhered to the gold standard policy, the two countries should be combined on monetary issues, to show each other's solidarity in the economy.

<h3>Italian Newspapers Express Sympathy for France's Policy Towards Germany</h3>

<p>German Newspapers' Criticism: (Berlin) The newspapers published in the afternoon all criticized France's attitude in the Franco-German negotiations. The National Socialist Party's organ "Attack Newspaper" believed that France's purpose was only to delay the time, and that the center of international talks was originally in Rome, but its position has now been gradually taken over by Paris. The newspaper concluded by saying that Germany demands that the number of defense forces be increased from 100,000 to 300,000, which is the minimum amount to guarantee Germany's security within a reasonable scope. The German Daily News stated that Germany is still continuing to fight unyieldingly, which France should understand. The Berlin Daily News said that France has now repeated the position it took on October 14th (the day Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference), and that "the position taken by Britain has been unacceptable to Germany, and France's position is even more difficult for Germany to accept."

<h3>Germany's Military Build-up to Reorganize the National Defense Force</h3>
<p>Blomberg to Succeed as Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>Re-Implementing Compulsory Military Service</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to well-informed sources today, the resignation of General Hammerstein, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, has opened the way for a thorough reorganization of the German National Defense Forces. It is expected that General Blomberg, Minister of National Defense, will succeed Hammerstein as Commander-in-Chief, and Captain Roehm, Chief of Staff of the Brownshirts, will be transferred to Minister of National Defense. The German government hopes that the signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles will allow Germany to increase its National Defense Forces to 300,000 people. It is expected that Roehm will soon select two-thirds of this number from the Stormtroopers.

<h3>US Treasury Orders Civilians to Turn In Hidden Gold</h3>
<p>Soliciting Gold to Concentrate in the National Treasury</p>
<p>Prelude to Implementing the Thomas Plan</p>
<p>(Washington) The acting Secretary of the Treasury, Morgenthau, today ordered that all gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates held by the public, with a few exceptions, be immediately turned over to the government in full, in exchange for other currencies at the legal official price of $20.67 per ounce. The regulations are exempted only for (1) gold licensed by the Treasury, (2) antique coins collected by collectors, but gold coins worth $2.50 each are still not covered by this rule, (3) small gold nuggets and gold filings that have not been melted and whose value does not exceed $100, and gold used for industrial or decorative purposes or gold needed for professional use (4) gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve Bank and the Financial Relief Corporation, (5) gold and foreign currency held by residents of the Philippines, Guam, Samoa, Hawaii, the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, but only if they do not reside in the continental United States or engage in industry and commerce in the continental United States. As for the method of submitting to the government, those who hold gold coins, gold bullion, or gold certificates can send them to the Federal Reserve Bank and its branches or member banks for collection, and at the same time send a letter to the Treasury Department informing them of the return situation. After the Treasury Department obtains a report from the collecting agency to prove it, it will exchange it for other currencies at the statutory gold price. If it is gold bars or gold bullion, although the Financial Relief Corporation is currently buying newly mined gold at a price of $34.06 per ounce, the Treasury Department will still convert it into common currency at the official price of $20.67. According to the previous presidential order prohibiting the hoarding of gold, people were still allowed to hoard gold or gold certificates worth less than $100, but now this gold is also turned over to the government. It is heard that the gold coins and gold certificates currently remaining in the hands of the public still amount to $528,531,814. In the future, except for those abroad, most of them will be turned over to the government. After the previous presidential order prohibiting the hoarding of gold, the court ruled that the president's order exceeded his authority based on the National Congress's authorization to the Treasury Department to recover gold. Therefore, this time the order was issued by the Treasury Department. As for the intention of this move, the Treasury Department did not explain it. It is expected that it will be to strictly enforce the prohibition of gold hoarding, or it may be a prelude to confiscating all the gold in the country, including that held by the Federal Reserve Bureau, and implementing the Thomas plan to reset the value of gold. A few days ago, the President ordered the Acting Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to jointly study the Thomas plan. This plan stipulates that the government confiscates all the gold in the country, gives it the statutory official price, and then sets the value of gold at 41 yuan and 34 minutes, twice the appropriate official price. It is estimated that the government can make a profit of 300 million yuan in one transfer, and the price of gold yuan will also be halved. According to Mr. Thomas, he will submit it to the National Congress. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>

<h3>French Merchants Suspect Transshipment Tax System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance received information that timber transported from abroad in the three northeastern provinces has been subject to a 5.5% transshipment tax. Since the promulgation of the method of collecting taxes in different places after the Northeast Customs was seized, it has been stipulated that timber, because it is impossible to identify its source, should be included in the category of import duties. Recently, the French Minister, Wiliton, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the wood veneer factory of French merchants transported wood from the three northeastern provinces, passed through Tianjin, and was transferred to Shanghai by workers. The various taxes paid reached 26 and a half percent of the original price of the goods, which was unbearable. He requested consultation with the Ministry of Finance for relief. The Ministry of Finance believed that the sections described in the French merchants' request seemed to be not well aware of the tax collection methods and the current transshipment tax system after the closure of the customs of the eastern provinces, and it was not convenient to grant reductions and exemptions for the taxes to be collected, which would be inconsistent with the general customs regulations. Yesterday, it has been requested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs forward the information to the French Minister for notification. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Customs Patrol Vessels Change Signals for Inspecting Ships</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance received information that the regulations for customs patrol vessels inspecting Chinese and foreign ships stipulate that when customs patrol vessels order civilian vessels or civilian ships to stop at sea for inspection, they emit three short whistle blasts and one long whistle blast, day or night.

In order to comply with international practice, the signal issued by customs patrol vessels ordering ships to stop has been changed to first sounding one short whistle blast, one long whistle blast, and then two short whistle blasts. Yesterday, the Inspector General of Customs was ordered to instruct all customs offices to comply, and at the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was requested to notify the governments of various countries to take note.

Therefore, various salt firms specially dispatched a representative, Xiang Jinwen, from Anhui to Nanjing, arriving at the Ministry of Finance on the 29th to petition.

They requested that the order be rescinded. After examining the situation, the Ministry of Finance agreed to retain the tooth licenses for several months, as stated by the representative.

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Strives to Complete Three Major Air Routes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Siji, the manager of China National Aviation Corporation, stated that the company's contract with the United States has reached three years, and past performance is still commendable. This year, the company is dedicated to completing three major air routes. The Shanghai-Beiping route was opened on January 10th of this year, the Chongqing-Chengdu route was opened on November 11th of this year, and the Shanghai-Guangdong route was opened on October 24th of this year. From then on, the north-south and east-west routes are connected, providing convenience for Chinese and foreign people. The Chongqing-Chengdu route is especially convenient. Previously, it took ten days to travel between Chengdu and Chongqing by both land and water. After the air route opened, it only takes two hours to travel over a thousand li.

The company plans to use the latest type of aircraft for flights between Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, and Chengdu next summer, as business is booming and passenger and postal services are developing.

<h3>Kaifeng Reporter Association Requests the Removal of Judge Hu Yuzhang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Kaifeng Reporter Association sent a telegram to Luo Wengan on the 28th stating that Hu Yuzhang, a judge of the Kaifeng District Court, showed extreme bias towards Fan Bingren in the case of Fan Bingren's investigation of the Henan Evening News. He refused to conduct an investigation and publicly insulted the newspaper for being bought. He also refused to read the record after the debate ended, which was already illegal. Since the judgment was unfair, the Kaifeng Reporter Association sent a letter to the president of the court, requesting that it be handled impartially in accordance with the Publishing Law to comply with the central government's intention to protect news professionals, but this was not accepted. Later, because the Evening News supplement contained the words "shaking his head" when questioning the case, Hu again created unnecessary trouble and suddenly accused Luo Tunchu, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, to the prosecutor's office for obstructing official duties. After the prosecutor filed a public prosecution, the Evening News requested a change of jurisdiction twice because the court already had a deep-seated bias, and also requested that the judge who had a friendship with Hu recuse himself, but neither was allowed. The intention is self-evident. The case opened on the 14th of this month, but the defendant Luo was not allowed to state his case, showing bias towards his colleague, which was obvious to everyone. On the 19th, a bizarre judgment was made, sentencing Luo to three months in prison. Luo has declared an appeal. The National Government issued an order to all agencies on September 1, instructing them to effectively protect news professionals, and also ordered the Executive and Judicial Yuan that if newspaper editors violate the Publishing Law, courts at all levels should handle it in accordance with the provisions of the Publishing Law and should not use other laws as sanctions. Hu Yuzhang destroys public opinion, wantonly defames, uses the law to indulge in personal gain, and disregards government orders. His illegal dereliction of duty is extreme. The Kaifeng news media has repeatedly advised him to wake up, but not only has he not repented, but he has intensified his actions and acted perversely. The entire news media in Kaifeng is extremely angry and has resolved through this association to send a telegram to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting that Hu Yuzhang be removed from office and investigated. This telegram is sent to you, and we urge your ministry to quickly remove the judge Hu Yuzhang from office and investigate him in order to comply with public opinion and quell public anger. We are extremely eager for your prompt action. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

At noon on the 26th, 4,000 to 5,000 bandits were also discovered on the Xishan Wanshou Palace side, with about 2,000 to 3,000 guns. The authorities ordered the Wei Regiment to suppress them. The vanguard encountered the bandits on the Xishan foothills north of Wanshou Palace. Both sides exchanged fire, with bullets raining down. Airplanes soared over Xishan, dropping bombs to assist in the battle, killing many bandits. However, the Wei Regiment retreated slightly due to the disparity in numbers. That night, the bandits fled to the west of Shengmi, 30 li from Niuhang Station. The General Headquarters immediately dispatched troops to cross the river and reinforce the west from Niuhang in the dim light of night. At the same time, the garrison troops in Gaoan also went east to pursue and suppress, taking a three-sided converging formation. On the 27th, as dawn approached, the bloody battle continued until 3:00 or 4:00 PM. Because the bandits had too many casualties, they retreated from Wanshou Palace in the northwest of Xinjian one after another. The air force flew to pursue and bomb them, killing even more bandits. By evening, the bandits fled in a panic from the Gaoan border towards the northwest. In addition to ordering each unit to pursue closely, the General Headquarters also mobilized certain units from the western route to block the bandits in separate directions, ensuring that they could not retreat to their old nests on the border of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, and planned to encircle and annihilate the bandits in a certain location. Recently, a telegram was received from Niuhang reporting the victory, stating that the Kong bandits had already fled far away, and that more than 600 bandits were killed in the battle.

<h3>Remnant Bandits in Ezhou South Return and Flee to the Border of Hunan and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Chongyang County City is Saved from Danger</p>
<p>Bandits Fleeing to Ezhou East Have Been Surrounded</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Kong Hechong's bandit forces, the fake 16th and 17th Armies, have recently fled from the border of Hunan and Jiangxi to Ezhou South in succession. Chongyang County City is in imminent danger, and the traffic on the Hunan-Ezhou Road is often cut off. After Chen Jicheng arrived in Puqi, representatives from various places petitioned one after another. Chen publicly stated that he had ordered Guo Rudong and Xiao Zhichu to each allocate elite troops to assist Feng Xingxian's division in suppressing the bandits, and that he had a thorough plan to eliminate the bandits, guaranteeing that the security of each county would be worry-free. Sure enough, within a few days, the bandits were defeated, Chongyang was saved from danger, and the bandits, unable to invade, looted in Hongxia, Zhulin Ao, Zhongxing Gai, and Jinshi Guan, and continued to flee back to the border of Hunan and Jiangxi. Chen then dispatched Feng Xingxian's and Li Dingwu's two units as pursuit forces, tracking and pursuing the bandits. At the same time, he telegraphed the garrison troops on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi to effectively block them, implementing a joint suppression by the three provinces. Chen, believing that the defenses of Puqi and Chongyang were solid, returned to Hankou on the armored train on the evening of the 27th. On the 28th, he visited Cao Haosen, the chief of staff of the General Headquarters, and He Chengyu, the appeasement director, to report on the progress, and returned to Daye that evening to prevent fires. The remnant bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, led by bandit leader Wu Huanxian, fled to Henan South and Anhui West, and have now returned to Ezhou East. One group is in Laojun Mountain and Tiantai Mountain in Huang'an, and the other is in Guangyu Mountain in Macheng. Xiao Zhichu, the commander of the 26th Army, sent troops to encircle and suppress the bandits in four directions. On the 27th, Xiao telegraphed the victory to Hankou, saying, "According to reliable reports, Wu Huanxian, the commander of the fake 25th Army, gathered about 2,000 remnants and fled from Henan to the Tiantai Mountain and Laojun Mountain area northwest of Huang'an around the Yangjing days of this month. I immediately ordered Wang's Brigade Commander Zhang Chi, stationed in Hekou Town, to lead two battalions of troops to suppress the bandits from Huajiahe. Chen's Brigade Commander Chuan, stationed in Qiliping, sent a battalion of troops to attack the bandits from the side. Li's Brigade Commander Yinchen, stationed in Huangpi Station, led two battalions of troops to assist in the suppression. Hao's Regiment, stationed in Xuanhuadian, sent a battalion of troops to guerilla towards the southeast to prevent the bandits from fleeing. Each suppression unit launched a simultaneous attack on the You Day. On that day, Li Yinchen's regiment encountered 500 to 600 remnants of the fake 73rd Division of the bandits in Tiantai Hougou, more than ten li north of Tiantai Mountain. They were given a severe attack. The bandits initially relied on the mountains to resist stubbornly, but after our army divided its troops to raid them, many were killed, and the remaining bandits fled to the northeast Dazhuyuan area. On the same day, our Hao Regiment's Liu Battalion patrolled from Xuanhuadian to the Heidouzai in the southeast. According to reports, the fake Ezhou Northeast Road Committee is now in Dazhuyuan, and the fake 25th Army and the fake 75th Division are in the southeast area of Hujiahe, with a total of about 1,000 people. Currently, each suppression unit is continuing to search and suppress the bandits. I heard that Xiao Zhichu was grateful." (December 28)</p>
<h3>He Jian Telegraphed an Order to Execute Yu Yizhong</h3>
<p>Yu Claimed to be the Commander-in-Chief of the All-People's Army</p>
<p>Fang Dingying Was Used by the Min Party to Disturb Hunan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: At the beginning of the Fujian Incident, Yu Yizhong, the leader of the Hunan branch of the Social Democratic Party, was instigated by the Fujian side, carrying 100,000 yuan to Hunan West to mobilize He Jingcheng, the commander of the First Regiment of the Fourth Security District, and the greenwoodsmen in Hunan West, occupying the counties of Qianyang and Huitong, and carrying out a rebellion. He claimed to be the All-People's National Salvation Army, with Yu Yizhong as the commander-in-chief, He Jingcheng as the commander of the First Division, Long Hongjun as the commander of the Second Division, and Lu Xin as the commander of the Third Division. At the beginning of the previous month, he led thousands of troops to attack Hongjiang. After the Brigade Commander Chen Zixian and Deputy Brigade Commander Xie Long supervised three regiments of soldiers to meet the attack, a fierce battle lasted for two days, and they were defeated. The counties of Qianyang and Huitong were also recovered. Yu, He, and others led the remnants and fled to the border of Qianzhou. At that time, Long Hongjun and Yang Zhennan (who was He Jingcheng's regiment commander) voluntarily surrendered and defected from the rebel army. Chen Zixian reported this to He Jian for approval and reorganization, and appointed Long and Yang as regiment commanders, stationed in their original defenses to await orders. After Yu, He, and others fled to the border of Qianzhou, they colluded with Qiu Yihua and other greenwoodsmen in various places on the border of Hunan and Qianzhou, hoping to rise again. Fang Dingying, who had previously served as the army commander of the Revolutionary Army, came from Fujian with a large amount of money to encourage Yu, He, and others to attack Hongjiang again. On the 12th of this month, they launched an attack from Huang County towards Qianyang and Huitong. On the evening of the 24th, they made contact with He Peilin's regiment of Chen Brigade in Anjiang, forty or fifty li from Hongjiang. He's regiment was surrounded because they were unfamiliar with the terrain. On the morning of the 25th, He's regiment desperately charged, and after a fierce battle until noon, they turned defeat into victory, broke the encirclement, and defeated more than 2,000 troops of Yu, He, and others. Yu Yizhong, the commander-in-chief of the All-People's National Salvation Army, was captured alive, and Fang Dingying, He Jingcheng, and others led the remnants and fled to the border of Qianzhou and Huangzhou. Yu Yizhong was sent to Hongjiang by He's regiment on the 26th. He Jian, upon receiving the report, immediately telegraphed an order to execute him on the spot and send his head to the province for public display. He also telegraphed Deputy Brigade Commander Xie Long to lead two regiments of soldiers to suppress the bandits via Jiangkou and Gulouping, and ordered He's regiment to follow up from Anjiang Daping to Qianzhou and Huangzhou, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop. The following is the victory telegram from Chen Brigade: "Our He Peilin regiment camped in Anjiang last night. The fake commander-in-chief Yu Yizhong gathered the remnants of He (Jingcheng) and Qiu (Yihua), about 2,000 people and guns, and launched a full-scale attack. Our He regiment was surrounded because they were unfamiliar with the terrain. The battle was extremely fierce from the next morning until noon. Finally, our He regiment desperately charged and completely defeated the bandits. The fake commander-in-chief Yu Yizhong was captured on the spot by the Fifth Company of He's regiment, and more than 100 bandits and more than 100 guns were captured. We also suffered dozens of casualties of officers and soldiers. In addition to ordering the regiment to send Yu to Hongjiang and proceed according to plan, I hereby telegraph the report. Details will be reported later. Yours sincerely, Chen Zixian." He Jian replied: "To Brigade Commander Chen of Hongjiang, He's regiment has made great efforts in combat and is worthy of commendation. After Yu is sent to Hongjiang, he will be executed on the spot, and his head will be sent to the province to please the people. A list of all the officers and soldiers who contributed will be reported for awards and compensation. We still rely on you to supervise and encourage the various units to work hard to suppress and eliminate the root causes. He Jian." (December 27)</p>
<h3>The Incident at the Tianjin Naval Hospital is Resolved</h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng Negotiates in Peiping and Tianjin</p>
<p>Reaches a New Agreement with the French Side</p>
<p>Regarding the incident at the Beiyang Naval Medical School Hospital, the Executive Yuan recently sent Liu Ruiheng to Peiping and Tianjin to meet with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy, and the French ambassador and French consul to negotiate a settlement. As a result, the agreement previously signed by Zhang Xueliang was cancelled, and a new agreement was reached. Liu Ruiheng released the following statement regarding this case:</p>
<p>"The Tianjin Beiyang Naval Medical School Hospital was founded in the Qing Dynasty and has been in existence for 53 years. The address was within the official land at that time. After the Boxer Rebellion, France opened a concession according to the treaty. The school hospital happened to be within the concession. Because it was official land, the French side believed that it belonged to the concession. After negotiations, conditions were proposed, such as hiring French teachers, and there was a saying that a silver tael of rent must be paid every year. It was then continued to be operated. Since the Republic of China, it has been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy. In the past six or seven years, due to lack of funds, a lot of salary was owed to Chinese and French teachers. The medical school was closed long ago, and the hospital was also badly damaged. This spring, Zhang Xueliang of the Peiping Military Branch negotiated with the French side to sell the land base in order to raise military expenses. The French side intended to deduct the cost of opening roads and various outstanding funds and donations after the price was changed, so there was not much left. However, this contract was signed by Zhang's representative and the French Consul on February 15, 22nd year. When this news came out, all parties believed that the real estate should not be disposed of by the Military Branch, and after so many years of the school and hospital, the cancellation caused widespread opposition. In April, the Executive Yuan decided to restore the school and hospital. The government will prepare funds to acknowledge the debt, rebuild it, and continue to operate it. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy dispatched representatives to Tianjin to negotiate with the French Consul to cancel the contract. The French Consul delayed and prevaricated about the cancellation of the agreement for many days. On the 9th of this month, the Executive Yuan ordered me to go to Peiping and Tianjin to meet with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy to resolve this matter. After I arrived in Tianjin, I met with the French Ambassador Weilitun and the French Consul Libisi. After a week of negotiations, the new agreement was drafted on the 17th. I immediately telegraphed the report to the Executive Yuan. The agreement was signed at 7:00 PM that evening. The main points of the new agreement are that 24 acres of land are designated for the Beiyang Naval Medical School Hospital for restoration, and 15 acres are used for opening new roads and providing road maintenance expenses. The Chinese government is responsible for repaying the arrears of French teachers' salaries, while the arrears of Chinese teachers' salaries will be handled separately by the Chinese and French parties through the exchange of letters. The full text of the contract has been approved by this session of the Executive Yuan meeting, and it has been resolved to set up a preparatory committee for the revival of the hospital and school, which will be organized by the four ministries of Interior, Finance, Education, and Navy to plan and handle the matter. The arrears of French teachers' salaries will be paid from the French Gengzi indemnity, and the arrears of Chinese teachers' salaries will be handled by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance. This matter can now be concluded for the time being. Regarding the negotiation process, there are still some things that need to be added. First, the general outline of the contract was determined by the Executive Yuan meeting in advance. Second, the conditions originally proposed by the French side, such as repaying the arrears of French teachers' salaries with the land price and donating funds to the Pasteur Laboratory, have been removed. Third, in fact, there is no possibility of a better outcome. The dispute has reached this point and has been exhausted. I have paid great attention to the arrears of Chinese teachers' salaries and have submitted them to the Executive Yuan meeting for exchange of letters. The Yuan has now transferred the matter to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance, which will naturally be settled and can be expected to be repaid. The revival of the medical school and hospital is very important and should be organized and handled by the preparatory committee as soon as possible. I sincerely hope to see it completed soon."</p>
<h3>Inspection Tour of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei (Special Correspondent Ren An)</h3>
<p>The Old Social System Once Destroyed</p>
<p>Lease Terms Becoming More Lenient</p>
<p>Huo Shan Correspondence: The Huo Shan Red Disaster, for more than four years, with repeated proposals to abolish land boundaries, ultimately failed to materialize. When they divided the land, destroyed the houses of landlords and gentry, opposed ancestral halls, eradicated superstition, and overthrew various old social systems, the peasants initially felt unaccustomed and wanted to flee. However, due to the tight organization and strict precautions taken by the Red bandits and various levels of puppet Soviet governments, they were unable to fulfill their wishes. Over time, they gradually became accustomed to it. The unscrupulous ones even acted as accomplices, causing various inconveniences to the National Army's suppression efforts. The remaining bandits in western Anhui were not easily eradicated, and this was the reason. Their land distribution system was based on productivity as the standard. Red bandits, Red bandit family members, and political workers of the puppet Soviet government first chose the fertile land and devoured it, and then gradually extended to others. After obtaining land, they had to fulfill obligations such as being requisitioned and performing various tasks. The amount of requisitioned items was always increased or decreased based on the abundance of the harvest. Ordinary people paid about one liter of grain per month to supply the Red bandits. Landlords and punished rich peasants, even if they became beggars, had to hand over any items they obtained each day that exceeded their daily living needs, without waiting to be requisitioned. Otherwise, they would be charged with concealing wealth and harboring evil without repentance. Ordinary poor farmers and workers were considered the best elements, and their words and deeds were relatively free. Even if they made mistakes, they were often forgiven. However, if rich peasants or intellectuals violated the law, they were severely punished without leniency.</p>
<p>The puppet Soviet government was organized with the village as the unit, with a chairman, also called the village head. Above the village was the township, with five or seven committee members in charge of land, labor, economy, culture, and food. The district and county organizations were the same as the township. However, in addition to various committees, the county also had a Political Security Bureau. The bureau had a revolutionary court that specialized in hearing cases against those who opposed the Red bandits. The bureau was located in Zhufo Town, seventy or eighty miles from the city, and was directly under the Northwest District Committee of the puppet government, wielding great power. The members who joined the Red Party before 1919, who initially led the riots in various villages, were all suspected of corruption by last year and were sentenced to death on charges of being members of the Reorganization Faction, AB Corps, or Reactionary Faction, numbering several thousands. The biggest reason for the failure of the Communist bandits was this self-inflicted slaughter. The mass grave of ten thousand people in that town is where the bodies of those killed in this massacre were buried, stained with blood and piled with white bones, a truly tragic sight. The outbreak of the Red Disaster in that area was initially due to the general influence of the Northern Expedition on young people, who all strived to engage in party affairs and conducted widespread propaganda in the countryside. Their central slogans were only "25% rent reduction," the abolition of "　Chicken," "Sauce Wheat," and "New Rice" (these were all customary gifts that local tenants had to send to landlords in addition to paying rent, namely sending chickens on New Year's Eve called "　Chicken," sending wheat when landlords made sauce in summer or winter called "Sauce Wheat," and selecting drooping ears of newly ripened grain, baking them dry, and grinding them into rice to send to the landlord to taste the new crop called "New Rice," the amount depending on the generosity or stinginess of the landlord), and "landlords must transport rental grain themselves," etc. Farmers usually paid too much rent and had to deliver it from far and wide, accumulating resentment that they dared not speak out. Hearing these slogans, they could not help but be moved and gradually protested to the landlords. The landlords and gentry deeply resented these propagandizing youths and drove them into hiding in the countryside, which was exploited by the Red bandits to conduct secret work, eventually leading to a major disaster, killing those who disagreed with them. It is said that the vast majority of those killed were the very people who first advocated the riots.</p>
<p>In addition to the National Army's four encirclement and suppression campaigns and the Red bandits' self-slaughter, they also stepped up the organization of children's groups, Red Guards, women's comfort teams, etc., turning farming families that should have been enjoying family happiness into nests of partings. In particular, encouraging young men to become bandits easily aroused dissatisfaction in the boudoirs. There was a so-called "Shepherd's Song," with lyrics like "My husband's revolution is true, the revolution has been two or three springs, scattering a family, husband in the south, wife in the north, the two of us separated by tears." Although the sentences are simple, they are very popular, which also shows a glimpse of the separation of flesh and blood and private resentment among the people in the bandit areas at that time. However, the Communist bandits, constrained by the situation, did not show weakness and also sang a song, "My wife doesn't have to worry, although it is difficult now, we must talk about the group, since I have come, you should also do it, love will not be hurt." There are two other songs, one is "The White Army is the real bandit, following the local tyrants to kill and destroy indiscriminately, a mess, showing off their power and prestige, we workers and peasants all suffer," which is used to slander the National Army and to warn workers and peasants to be conscious and make their own decisions. The other is "Widow is young, wants to marry, mother-in-law and both families, have not explained, there is a person behind the mountain, he is young, and I like him, no money to marry, come to the side of the road, two eyes full of tears, look up and see the Communist Party members, Party members say good, equal women, find themselves, find a good man, who can farm, and ride horses and sit in sedan chairs." This is to persuade young widows to choose their own husbands and marry. In addition, there are many tea-picking tunes and children's songs, but they are not as popular or as deeply impressive as the above three songs. Even farmers and women who have been married for more than a year can still recite them with a smile, but they dare not recite the important sentences.</p>
<p>According to the county magistrate, the current social situation is becoming more stable. There is only one civil lawsuit every ten days or so, mostly related to "touching melons" (a euphemism for theft). In the northwest township, which is adjacent to Lihuang County, several assassination cases have recently occurred, all of which are local gentry, such as heads of baojia (a system of local administration). They were suddenly intercepted and killed, and there was no way to solve the cases. Rich merchants, in particular, are trembling with fear, secretly carrying opium paste to prevent being kidnapped and to commit suicide if misfortune befalls them. This is because, on the one hand, the township is wary of the remaining bandits in Lihuang County who may come to harass them from time to time, and on the other hand, the surrendered and reformed people are arrogant and unruly, and may occasionally relapse into old habits, or because landlords may retaliate for past grievances, which can easily lead to assassinations. In the southeast township, there are real bandits who rob merchants, big and small, and sometimes even fight with small groups of Red bandits, presumably to seize weapons from each other.</p>
<p>Huo Shan's education has never been developed. The number of literate people is far less than that of Liu'an. During the Red period, hundreds of Lenin elementary schools were established. At the beginning of the recovery, the army converted them into short-term compulsory elementary schools and reformatories, extensively recruiting surrendered and reformed elements and providing them with special education, with remarkable results. It was hoped that they would be converted into formal elementary schools to educate tens of thousands of school-age children. Unexpectedly, each school and institute only operated for one term and then stopped abruptly. Currently, there are only two or three public and private elementary schools in the city, and all the four townships are missing. The county government has repeatedly ordered the preparation, but it is still indifferent due to lack of funding. However, the customs are simple, and the opium scourge is also light. The social economy is not difficult to recover. The county government officials are neatly dressed, adhere to office hours, and have a strong sense of service, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the value of land rose to 300 yuan per picul, and even the lower grades were around 200 yuan. When leasing land, the "deposit money" (i.e., rent deposit) paid by tenants to landlords was as high as 50 or 60 yuan per picul of land. The ordinary rental yield accounted for about 50% of the harvest, and there was always the risk of changing tenants. Since the Red Disaster, the price of land has fallen by about 100 yuan, and the deposit money has fallen to more than 10 yuan. The rental yield has also been reduced slightly, and the lease term is longer. If the tenant withdraws, it is mostly proposed by the tenant. If it is proposed by the landlord, in addition to returning the deposit money, a small amount of compensation must be given. Among the farmers in the county, self-cultivating farmers and semi-self-cultivating farmers each account for 20%, and tenant farmers account for 60%. The area of land cultivated by self-cultivating farmers accounts for 15%, and the area of land cultivated by tenant farmers accounts for 85%. In good years, it is only enough to eat, and in normal and famine years, it is necessary to rely on imports from Liu'an and Shucheng.</p>
<p>Tea is the main product, with an annual output of more than 10,000 catties, worth more than 200,000 yuan. The so-called Songluo tea has a rich fragrance and is as famous as Hugiu tea in Wu. The next is bamboo and wood, with an annual output of more than 300,000 plants, worth more than 50,000 yuan. Poria cocos is more than 1,000 piculs, worth more than 20,000 yuan. Broomcorn is more than 200,000 bundles, worth more than 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The large groups of bandits in the entire territory have indeed been wiped out, but scattered bandits still rob homes and disturb the people from time to time. The security team has only four platoons, which is very difficult to defend everywhere. The county government has specially formulated twenty articles of the "United Village Anti-Bandit Outline" and ordered it to be issued to the chiefs of each district for compliance. The method is roughly that each bao sends ten strong men every day to form a police team, who are trained in rotation, and gather at 5:00 pm to take on patrol, sentry, reconnaissance, search, and all alert matters. The amount of work is changed every day to avoid delaying farming time, and they rotate in shifts to avoid partial labor. Patrols must strike wooden clappers to correspond to the clapper sounds of other baos. In case of a bandit alert, two shots are fired from a musket to seek assistance. It is said that since the implementation, the cases of "touching melons" and the fear of the wind have begun to decrease day by day.</p>

<h3>Bandits Plan to Rob Hongxi Town</h3>
<p>Hongjiatan Town in this county is located in a water town and is famous for its kiln industry. In the autumn of 1928, the town was robbed by a joint force of Jiangbei, Henan, and Pudong gangs, and many hostages were kidnapped. The town's commerce has fallen into ruin. Unexpectedly, in the midst of devastation, there are rumors that the three gangs will rob the entire town again. On the 24th, Ye, the squad leader of the town's security corps, and Li, the kiln owner, each received threatening letters from Shanghai, stating that the brothers of the three gangs had suffered in the past and were now coming for revenge. Please prepare 3,000 yuan in silver dollars and send someone to Shanghai on the early train to Hangzhou to negotiate, otherwise they will rob the entire town immediately. Squad Leader Ye immediately submitted the original letter to the county government and added strong troops to strictly defend.</p>

<h3>A Bandit Captured in the Donglai Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Donglai Town in the Fourth District was robbed by seventy or eighty pirates on the night of the 27th. All shops and residents were spared. All the circumstances have been recorded and reported. After the incident, Wang Kunshan, the captain of the county police team, took a steamship to conduct a reconnaissance on the 28th and returned to the city at 12:00 am. According to the investigation, there were more than sixty bandits who arrived in the town one after another, and it was not a day. They used four-inch long white cloth as a sign. The day before, they had first gone to the water police station to investigate their strength. As a result, the captain, Li Yinqing, was bound by the bandits, and all the weapons were taken away. Then they went to rob separately. That night, three guests from other provinces suddenly asked to stay overnight in Xin Zhuang Port. Because they were suspicious, one person was arrested, and two escaped. One of them, Li Songjiu, from Nantong, was a tailor. He did not admit to being a thief. Because the police suspected him of being involved, they took him to the bureau and sent him to the county for interrogation on the 29th.</p>

Ms. Bema held a bunch of fresh flowers in her left hand and a champagne bottle with five-colored silk in her right hand, aimed at the bow of the ship, and threw it forcefully. With a bang, it hit the bow of the ship right in the center, and champagne splashed everywhere. The ship then entered the Huangpu River amid cheers and applause and was towed to the shipyard's pier by a small tugboat to dock. At 11:30 am, the Haiping ship was launched by Ms. Bema in the same way, declaring the ceremony a success.</p>
<p>Director's Speech: After the launching, Mr. Chen Zaofan led the Chinese and foreign guests to the shipyard's restaurant for refreshments. Mr. Chen delivered a speech, saying that today is the launching ceremony of the Haihui and Haiping patrol ships, and he was honored to have Mr. Mei, the Inspector General of Customs, and all the Chinese and foreign guests take the time to attend, and he was even more grateful to Ms. Bema for performing the launching ceremony.

It is learned that Mr. Bao was originally scheduled to take the Dollar Company's President Polk to Hong Kong with Feng Yong on the 2nd of next month. Now, because Mr. Feng Yong arrived in Shanghai the night before last, he intends to leave Shanghai a few days earlier and decided to take the French postal ship Pao Daosi this morning with Rongzhen, Mi Chunlin, Tang Guozhen, Zhang Wujiu, Liu Hengyu, and others to Hong Kong. The ship is currently berthed at the north pier of the China Merchants Bureau in Hongkou and is scheduled to set sail at about 9:00 am this morning.

<h3>Five Bureaus of the Municipal Government Have Started Working During the Relocation</h3>
<p>The Mayor's Office and the Secretary-General's Office</p>
<p>Still Need to Wait Until Tomorrow to Move</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Government and its subordinate offices began to move to the new building in the city center on the 25th of this month, except for the Secretariat and the Land Bureau, which have not been able to complete the move, the others have all started working in the new building in the city center. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Five Bureaus Started Working: The four bureaus of public works, social affairs, education, and health have all been arranged in the new building and officially started working yesterday. A part of the Land Bureau has also moved into the new building. The three bureaus of social affairs, education, and health are working in the new building on the left side of the municipal government, and the two bureaus of land and public works are working in the new building on the right side. The houses of each bureau are still spacious and connected together, which will be convenient for future work.</p>
<p>The Secretariat Will Be Completed Today: The Municipal Government Secretariat also started moving on the 28th. The record room, library, compilation section, and the documents of the third section were moved on that day. Yesterday (the 29th), the entire second section, the entire third section, and the medical room were also moved. Today, the first section, the Council Chamber, the Secretary's Telecommunications Office, the Telephone Office, the Guard Office, the Delivery Room, and the External Dispatch Room will be moved.

<h3>After the Arrest of Jin Xi, Public Outrage Intensifies, Resorting to International Appeal</h3>
<p>Requesting the World Human Rights Council to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, various local legal entities, such as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Lawyers Association, the General Labor Union, and the Citizens' United Association, all believe that since Jin Xi has proven his naturalization as a Chinese citizen, he should be protected by Chinese law. Moreover, he has resided in the French Concession for five or six years. The French Consulate, in collusion with the Japanese police, illegally arrested him. Despite serious protests from the Municipal Government and various legal entities, he has not been released for over a month, causing deep indignation. It is expected that a Jin Xi Relief Organization will be formed soon to jointly telegraph the major powers, requesting a public trial. Yesterday, Chen Yang, the representative of Jin Xi's family, told a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency that the case of Jin Xi's illegal arrest by the Japanese Consulate has drawn nationwide attention. Various local legal entities deeply feel that this matter harms national sovereignty, and they are able to speak out righteously and strive vigorously, which is highly admirable. However, the Japanese Consulate disregards justice and, despite loud appeals and serious protests, remains indifferent, delaying and procrastinating. With such prolonged detention, Mr. Jin's life is in real danger. Therefore, the family, in addition to requesting the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge serious protests simultaneously, sees no other recourse. They recently sent a letter to various local legal entities, soliciting methods for providing assistance. In recent days, they have received replies from various legal entities, all willing to join in forming a powerful organization to serve as a backing for the government. They will also telegraph the Paris World Human Rights Protection League, hoping that it will use its great authority to protect human rights, rise up and protest, and promote international attention. They believe that the ultimate truth and falsehood will be subject to public opinion.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Plan to Develop National Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>Completing Three Major Trunk Lines This Year</p>
<p>Cultivating Domestic Aviation Talent</p>
<p>Shanghai Times News Agency, Shanghai: Since the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has completed the Shanghai-Ping (Beijing), Shanghai-Rong (Chengdu), and Shanghai-Yue (Guangdong) trunk lines one after another, it has recently begun to develop southwestern routes. If the test flights are successful, regular flights will be officially launched. Yesterday, the Shanghai Times reporter visited Mr. Dai Siji, the general manager of CNAC, and asked him to provide detailed information about the future development plan of civil aviation in China. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Completion of Three Major Trunk Lines: According to Mr. Dai, CNAC has been in operation for three years and has been fully committed to completing the three major trunk lines during this time. The Shanghai-Ping line was launched on January 10th this year, the Yu-Rong line on November 11th this year, and the Shanghai-Yue line on October 24th this year. From then on, the north, south, east, and west will be connected, marking the success of the first phase of the company's development.</p>
<p>Overview of This Year's Business: Regarding the company's business situation, compared to December last year and the same month this year, passenger ticket revenue last year was over 20,000 yuan, and this year it has doubled to about 40,000 yuan. In terms of mail, it was over 40,000 yuan last year and has increased to over 70,000 yuan this year, also a significant improvement. He also showed various statistics from January to the end of November of the 22nd year: (1) The number of passengers was 2,349. (2) The mail carried was 40,767 kilograms. (3) The number of miles flown was 571,912.</p>
<p>Cultivating Aviation Talent: Mr. Dai continued, "When our company first started, we hired many foreign personnel due to the lack of domestic talent. Now, Chinese people are also capable of doing the job. Currently, wireless radio and aircraft repair technicians are all Chinese. The Sino-American contract only lasts for ten years, so cultivating aviation talent is something we cannot delay. Our company has already paid active attention to this."</p>
<p>Expanding Airport Facilities: The Longhua Airport was originally planned to have two runways. One has already been completed, and the second has been under construction for a long time and will be completed soon. This type of new-style airport is rare in the country. New sheds will be built next spring to make it complete.</p>
<p>Developing Southwestern Routes: Mr. Dai concluded, "The current test flights to the southwest are in response to the needs of transportation in the southwest. At the same time, the Yunnan Provincial Government also expressed its approval. Therefore, our company is actively preparing. It was originally scheduled to fly from Hankou the day before yesterday, but the fog was heavy in the Changsha area, so it could not take off as scheduled. It was still raining yesterday, so it did not fly. Once the test flight is successful, the scheduled flight will be launched."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special District National Goods Movement Congress, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers United Association, previously had a section of the temporary market that did not conform to the construction style of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, and there were concerns about safety, so it was rebuilt.

<h3>The "Yuji" That Ran Aground at Dongguashan is Safe and Will Return</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>The Losses Are Quite Significant</p>
<p>The "Yuji" steamer of the Yu Da Company ran aground at Dongguashan near Wenzhou. The company and the Lianbao Insurance Company immediately dispatched the Sanjiang steamer, carrying engineers, equipment, and materials, to provide rescue. After many days of construction, a telegram was received yesterday stating that the ship has been rescued and will soon return to Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Repairing the Holes: The "Yuji" steamer ran aground in the area of the first and second holds. The damage was inspected by the divers brought by the Sanjiang steamer, and it was found that there were only two holes, which were not large and easy to repair. The engineers who came along temporarily filled and repaired the two holes in the bottom of the ship with cement, wood panels, and rubber. Fortunately, the engine room and the rear hold were undamaged, making the rescue easier.</p>
<p>Abandoning the Cargo: The first and second holds were flooded to a depth of 15 feet at the time, and the fruit stored in the holds was rotten and damaged. In order to carry out the ship rescue work, the shipping company and the insurance company decided to abandon the damaged cargo in those two holds. The passengers had consulted with the insurance company insuring the cargo about this matter. It is now learned that the damaged cargo in the first and second holds has been removed. In recent days, the workers transported there have used pumps to remove the accumulated water from the two holds, allowing the hull to float to the surface of the sea, and then sailed away from the shoal with the tide.</p>
<p>The Ship is Safe: It has been 12 days since the "Yuji" steamer ran aground. Yesterday, the company in Shanghai received news that the rescue work of the "Yuji" steamer has been completed. It is expected that it can sail out of the Dongguashan shoal today. The internal engine and machinery are all in good condition. The ship, after sailing out of the shoal, plans to stop temporarily at Ruian near Wenzhou for inspection of the hull to ensure safe navigation, and then sail to Shanghai. The cargo in the third and fourth holds of the ship has not been damaged.</p>
<p>Major Repairs in Shanghai: According to company insiders, the "Yuji" steamer can arrive in Shanghai within three days. After arriving in Shanghai, the cargo will be unloaded and major repairs will be carried out in the dock. The reason for the ship's grounding this time was mainly because the captain changed the route to the inner circle during the voyage, and the wind and waves were huge near the Dongguashan sea area, causing it to be forced to the rocks and hit them. Fortunately, the passengers and crew were unharmed, and the ship was able to escape danger. However, the delay in the voyage, the damage to the goods, the dispatch of ships for rescue, and the employment of technicians have resulted in significant losses.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Convenes Egg Merchants' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Countermeasures Against France's Increase in Egg Tax</p>
<p>Resolved to Request the Ministry of Finance to Reduce Egg Export Tax</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Industry stating that France's increase in the license tax for egg imports and restrictions on import quantities have a significant impact on China's egg industry. The bureau was ordered to convene local egg merchants to discuss remedial measures. Therefore, yesterday at 3:00 PM, the bureau convened various egg merchants for a meeting in the conference room of the bureau. More than ten representatives, including those from Maochangli and Huan, attended. Various countermeasures were resolved. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: The representatives who attended yesterday were Zheng Jiying (Lihuan), Shi Yingke, Lin Haijin, Chen Qingcheng (Central Refrigeration Factory), Pan Younian, Wang Lizhuan, Wang Xifan (Xiji), Zheng Yuanxing (Maochang), Cui Lianggong (Egg Industry Association), Man Cai (Peiji), Bao Siting, Mai Su, Sha Bo, and Dang Youjize, chaired by Ji Zequan.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the ceremony, the chairman gave a brief report, stating that the position of China's egg exports is extremely important. It ranked third in 1930, fourth in 1931, and third again in 1932. Exports to France account for 4% of egg exports, with frozen eggs being the most and fresh eggs being very few. It was estimated that 15,027 piculs were exported in 1912, 21,884 piculs in 1922, and 33,057 piculs in 1932. The number of exports has gradually increased, but in the fourth quarter of 1933, France limited the amount that China could export to 142.5 tons, equivalent to 2,394 piculs. According to this calculation, it is about 9,576 piculs per year, which is too different from the number of exports from China in previous years. This time, France has increased the import license tax for frozen eggs to 4 francs and 60 centimes per net kilogram, which is almost 100% of the value. Compared with the fresh egg tax (1 franc and 50 centimes per net kilogram), the fresh egg tax is only one-third of the frozen egg tax. This modification of the import restriction quantity takes the purchase of French goods by various countries as the standard. The imposition of frozen egg tax directly hits China's export trade and indirectly affects the rural economy. Countries are promoting the chicken raising industry, and egg production can gradually be self-sufficient. They are all adopting tariff protection policies, increasing egg import taxes, and restricting import quantities.</p>
<p>Resolutions: In addition to the following three points, the egg merchants proposed yesterday that the ice egg industry and the egg industry association will hold another meeting to submit their opinions to the International Trade Bureau for implementation by the Ministry of Industry. (1) (Countermeasures) France has increased import taxes on egg exports from our country and restricted the amount of our country's exports. It is requested that our government take countermeasures by increasing the import tax on French goods entering China, or restricting them by a corresponding amount. (2) (Method of Exchange of Equivalent Goods) The goods imported from France to our country are mostly cosmetics and consumer goods, which are light in weight and have high profits. The goods imported from our country to France are mostly raw materials or agricultural products, which are heavy in weight and have low profits. If France increases taxes on agricultural products imported from our country, and our country only increases taxes on consumer goods imported from that country, the advantages and disadvantages are very different in comparison. Therefore, our country should use the principle of increasing tax rates on equivalent items. (3) Request the Ministry of Industry to consult the Ministry of Finance to reduce egg export taxes in order to ease the burden on egg merchants.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Instructions: The International Trade Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, the original text of which is as follows: Approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' advice, according to the French Embassy's presentation, requesting the government to increase the import license tax for frozen eggs and modify the import restriction quantity, advise for verification and handling, etc., and attach a copy of the original letter from the French Frozen Egg Importers Association and a copy of the French agricultural product import table to the ministry. After reviewing the attached original letter, it requested that efforts be made to negotiate with the French government to increase the restriction quantity and to assist in negotiating a reduction in the frozen egg import license tax. This case is implemented uniformly by the French government to all countries, based on the same principles for distribution. However, the French government has changed the collection of the import license tax for frozen eggs, which is almost 100% of the value. Compared with the fresh egg license tax, the fresh egg tax is only one-third of the frozen egg tax. And our country exports the most frozen eggs to France, and very few fresh eggs. Therefore, this change in the license tax is the most unfavorable to our country's egg export industry. According to last year's data, the quantity of eggs exported by our country to France only accounted for 4% of the total egg exports. Now the French government has increased the license tax and will modify the import restriction quantity. Our country's egg industry urgently needs to improve quality, reduce costs, and improve sales methods in order to develop. In addition to separately advising the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to discuss this matter, the attached letters and the original attachments, as well as a translation of the letter from the French Chamber of Commerce and a document from our ministry advising the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, are hereby copied to you. Please carefully plan a remedial plan and convene egg merchants to discuss in detail, sign and express your opinions, and submit them together for verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Dispute at Sanyou Industrial Society Resolved</h3>
<p>Both Parties Signed a Peace Treaty at the Cotton Control Association Yesterday</p>
<p>Dagon News Agency reported that the case of Sanyou Industrial Society and the Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, which involved dismissal disputes and litigation enforcement, has lasted for two years. The targets of the dispute between the two parties are different, and there is no proper solution. The Cotton Control Association of the National Economic Commission believes that with the dumping of foreign goods and the decline of domestic industries, labor and management should sincerely help each other. If the case continues to be entangled in litigation, neither party will benefit. Therefore, the association appointed its member Du Junsheng to mediate. Mr. Du was well aware of the difficulties of both parties, and the plan he proposed was very pertinent. After several contacts, the result was very satisfactory. Yesterday (December 29th) at 4:00 PM, a reconciliation contract was signed in the office of the Cotton Control Association. Gong Yuting, Zhang Yihai, and Bao Boyi from the labor side, Cen Zihou, Ji Jiannan from the capital side, as well as lawyers and Mr. Du Yuesheng and Chen Guangfu, all signed in order. All the rights of the labor side to the right to resume work, food allowance, and dismissal fees under the original contract as stated in the decision of the Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee on September 1, 1931, are waived. The spirit and form of the labor side's willingness to show consideration for the capital side to give up vested rights are consistent. During the meeting, the reconciliation method previously agreed upon was followed to sign a peace treaty and declare the completion of the resolution. After the signing of this document, the two parties will separately file statements to withdraw all litigation cases. The dispute that had been delayed for two years has now come to a complete and satisfactory end.</p>
<h3>The Third Phase of Aviation Lottery Was Drawn at Yiyuan Yesterday Morning</h3>

<p>Venue Situation: The lottery drawing site yesterday was still held at the Yiyuan Racecourse on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. The venue was still built in front of the grandstand, covered with reed mats, and hung with the flags of the Party and the country and the flags of all nations. Inside and outside Yiyuan, the French police dispatched a large number of detectives to stand guard, so the situation was very solemn. The weather was quite cold yesterday, so two electric stoves were temporarily installed under the drawing platform.

In addition, the reporting blackboard was set up in two places yesterday so that any errors could be checked at any time.</p>
<p>Attendees: Those who attended yesterday included Zheng Lai, director of the lottery office, who personally led all the staff of the office to the venue.

<p>Drawing Situation: At 10:30 AM, the representatives of all parties inspected the number beads and completed them, and then started putting them into the shaking lottery tube. Huang Guoen, secretary of the lottery office, reported, and the drawing began. Because the seventh prize had changed its method, the time was very economical. It was completed at 12:30 PM, for a total of 168 drawing times, which saved more than one-third of the time compared to the first and second drawings.</p>
<p>Grand Prize Numbers: The winning numbers yesterday, from the first prize to the fourth prize, are as follows: First prize one ticket number 313817, second prize two ticket numbers 138990, 068244, third prize four tickets, numbers 009302, 310557, 189857, 351240, fourth prize ten tickets, numbers 210695, 276337, 285259, 455333, 003848, 408602, 094680, 234768, 334223, 246983.</p>
<p>First Prize Adjustment: According to an investigation by the Huadong News Agency reporter, the first prize drawn yesterday was sold by the Shanghai Dayun Company to Dafulai, and then sold by Dafulai to Xingong Hexiang Tobacco and Paper Store at No. 549 Gongguan Road, French Concession, Shanghai. According to the store clerk's statement to the Dong News Agency reporter, the first prize lottery ticket was only obtained and sold on the 12th of this month. Two strings were sold that day, and two more strings were sold the next day. The rest were sold at various branch stores. One string was sold to the Huaihe area, because the customer at the time said he lived in Huaihe. One string was purchased by a Westerner from North Sichuan Road, and one string was obtained by a certain Indian policeman who controls the traffic lights at a certain police station in the First District Court. However, the other six strings were not noticed at the time, and the customers who purchased the tickets were unwilling to leave their names, so there is no way to investigate.</p>
<p>Other Prizes: As for the other prizes, according to news from Dayun Company, two second prizes were also sold by the company, one at Daliyuan Alley on Simalu in Shanghai, and one at Shanzhong Store in Xinbeimen in Shanghai. All four third prizes have also been sold, and Da Youli on North Nicheng Bridge and Shiyunlai on Huade Road, and Mr. Yang of Dada Steamer Company in Lao Beimen each won one. Of the ten fourth prizes, the company sold seven, which have been investigated. One is at Junji Company in Chongqing, Sichuan, one is at the China National Goods Branch in Nanchang, Jiangxi, one is at Yong'an Company in Shanghai, one is at Daliyuan Store in Shanghai, one is at Dafayuan Store in Shanghai, one is Mr. Wei Xingui of the Huiluo Company, and one is at the Gongxin Mutual Aid Syndicate in Shanghai. As for the other fifth, sixth, and seventh prizes, the number is too large to investigate for the time being.</p>
<p>Announcement of Prize Collection: The National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office issued a notice yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: For the purpose of the notice, the lottery drawing for the third phase of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery is scheduled to be held publicly today. All lottery tickets that win prizes in this phase should be redeemed for prize money. All three banks, Central China Transportation, will be entrusted to pay on behalf of the lottery ticket holders from January 6th, 2023. The effective period for awarding prizes is from seven days after the lottery drawing to June 30th, 2023. If it is not claimed after the deadline, it will be invalid. This is hereby announced. December 29, 2022, Director Zheng Lai,</p>
<p>Total Number Sold: According to Huadong News Agency's inquiry to Dayun Company, the number of lottery tickets sold this time is very large. Although Fujian Province could not sell them due to the incident, its sales record exceeded the first and second phases. Dayun Company had previously taken 350,000 tickets from the office for sale, and later sold many more. The office sold a total of more than 400,000, leaving only a few 20,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>Fourth Phase of Lottery Tickets: The fourth phase of aviation lottery tickets has been printed and is now ready. Sales began yesterday, and all three major companies, Yong'an, Xianshi, and Xinxin, and various shops are selling them. As for the banking sector, because tomorrow is a holiday, sales have been temporarily postponed and will not begin until the day after tomorrow. Dalian Company has already booked a large number of lottery tickets from the Aviation Lottery Office yesterday and distributed them to various sales points. Starting last night, the fourth phase of lottery tickets will be distributed to various provinces and cities such as Jing, Ping, Gan, Wan, and E, so sales will also be available in other places within a few days.</p>
<p>Postponement of Lottery Drawing: According to the usual practice, the lottery drawing is held at the end of every two months, so the fourth phase of lottery tickets must be drawn at the end of February. However, according to the person in charge of Dayun Company yesterday, the lottery drawing for the fourth phase of aviation lottery tickets must be postponed for three days, because February happens to have 28 days, which is less than 30 days, so it is postponed to March 2 before the lottery drawing will be held.</p>

<h3>Huge Case of Pirates Robbing Ships and Kidnapping Police in Wusong Paotai Bay</h3>
<p>Police Officer Tian Honghe Narrowly Escapes Being Killed by Pirates</p>
<p>Three Captured Pirates Confess to the Whereabouts of Their Gang Leader</p>
<p>At approximately 5:00 PM the night before last, the Wusong Fourth Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team discovered a large wooden ship loaded with timber near the customs area outside Paotai Bay in Wusong. As the officers boarded the wooden ship to investigate, the pirates, who had been alerted in advance, captured one of the officers and confined him in the hold. The remaining officers jumped into the river and swam to safety. Upon hearing the news, the General Team immediately notified all teams by telephone to mobilize with weapons and, together with the chief of the Seventh District General Office, rushed to surround and suppress the pirates. However, the pirates, realizing the situation was dire, had already boarded another ship and fled out to sea. It was not until dawn the next day that a pirate ship was intercepted, and three pirates were captured. The three pirates confessed to the location of a large-scale pirate den, with more than a thousand members. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Police Officer Kidnapped At approximately 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a large ship fully loaded with timber suddenly arrived and anchored near the customs area outside Paotai Bay in Wusong. In the evening, shadows could be seen moving on the ship, and voices were heard. This was discovered by Li Wenhan, a patrol officer of the Wusong Fourth Squad of the Water Patrol Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, who found it suspicious. Therefore, at approximately 11:00 PM, he dispatched four police officers, Hou Bengui, Tian Honghe, Du Wentang, and Wang Shuchen, on a sampan to approach the wooden ship to investigate the truth. Unexpectedly, more than twenty pirates, each armed with guns, swarmed out of the hold. They first grabbed Police Officer Tian Honghe, tied him up with rope, and pushed him into the hold.</p>
<p>Large Force Sent to Arrest Upon seeing this, Police Officer Hou Bengui, who was behind, realized the situation was dire. He immediately turned around, jumped back onto the sampan, and sped back to the team to report to Patrol Officer Li. The remaining two police officers, Du Wentang and Wang Shuchen, seeing the urgency of the situation, jumped onto the stern of the ship and, disregarding everything else, plunged into the river and swam back to the team. After receiving the report from Police Officer Hou, Patrol Officer Li immediately reported to the South City General Team and the Seventh District General Office, requesting assistance. The General Team Leader, Zhu Haishan, upon receiving this alarm, immediately accompanied Deputy Team Leader Li Chenghua, personally supervising Patrol Officer Pan Xutong, and, together with Seventh District Chief Gong Xikui, Fourth Squad Patrol Officer Li Wenhan, and more than one hundred police sergeants and officers, all fully armed, boarded multiple steamships and rushed to the scene overnight.</p>
<p>Abandoned Weapons and Fled Upon arriving near the Customs area outside Paotai Bay in Wusong, they first surrounded the large wooden ship. Then they rushed onto the ship to arrest the pirates. The pirates, seeing Police Officer Hou Bengui and others flee in different directions, realized they would report to the police and that the officers would come to suppress them. Therefore, they boarded a ship fully loaded with kerosene and sailed directly out of the Wusongkou, fleeing the scene. When General Team Leader Zhu and others boarded the wooden ship, there was no trace of the pirates. All that remained was a ship of timber, the ship's captain Lin Xingzhong, the crew members Miao Santao, Lin Niansan, Feng Abin, and three rifles and fifty-five rounds of ammunition abandoned by the pirates as they fled.</p>
<p>Accomplices Intercepted Lin, the captain, and the others were immediately detained, and a search of the hold revealed the kidnapped Police Officer Tian Honghe still inside. After rescuing him from the hold, the police dispersed to search the riverbanks inside and outside Wusongkou. At approximately 3:00 AM yesterday, the police intercepted a sampan near Bailonggang on the Pudong side, traveling rapidly from east to west. There were three men on board, whose behavior appeared suspicious. They were immediately ordered to stop and the police boarded the boat. After questioning the men, their answers were evasive. They were detained and taken back to the South City Water Patrol General Team.</p>
<p>Police Officer Nearly Killed However, the kerosene ship used by the pirates escaped to sea on the rising tide, and its whereabouts are unknown. Therefore, Team Leaders Zhu and Li and District Chief Gong continued the siege until dawn, but still did not see any trace of the pirate ship. It was already approximately 6:00 AM. The police then returned separately. Subsequently, at approximately 9:00 AM, Team Leaders Zhu and Li separately interrogated the captured criminals. First, Police Officer Tian Honghe stated that after he was kidnapped last night, the pirates wanted to shoot him. At that time, one of the pirates, who appeared to be the leader, said, "As long as he (referring to me) doesn't make a sound, spare his life." After speaking, he ordered another pirate to stuff a piece of cotton in my mouth so that I couldn't speak. Then they boarded a ship and fled, and so on.</p>
<p>Ship Owner's Testimony The ship's captain, Lin Xingzhong, testified that he was 57 years old and from Huangyan, Zhejiang. He said, "My ship is named Jinshuntai. On the 28th day of the tenth lunar month of this year, I loaded a ship of timber from Wenzhou on behalf of a customer and was transporting it to Chongming. Unexpectedly, when sailing through the waters of Bai Ban Yang, dozens of pirates suddenly appeared, each armed with guns. They boarded my ship and forced me to sail to Shanghai. Along the way, they forced us to provide them with food. Yesterday, my ship was forced to sail to the customs area outside Wusongkou. I was about to go ashore to report to the police when two pirates, each holding a pistol, secretly pressed them against my waist and forced me to go to customs to declare the cargo and then sail into Wusongkou and anchor there. Fortunately, the police discovered this and came to suppress the pirates. Otherwise, the pirates would have stolen the entire ship of timber," and so on.</p>
<p>Confession of Pirate Leader The crew members Miao Santao, Lin Niansan, and Feng Abin gave confessions consistent with Lin's testimony. They identified the three men on the intercepted sampan as pirates. The three pirates were then questioned one by one. One pirate, named Li Chenglai, age 37, from Haimen, Taizhou, confessed that "Our mountain stronghold is on Xijishan Mountain in Haimen, Taizhou. The chieftain is Xiang Langao. There are also Tiannanwang Li Kexing, Wang Laowu, Jin Maorong, Li Yongxing, and others as leaders. We have more than a thousand brothers and plenty of weapons. We usually intercept merchant ships in various sea areas. This time, Li Kexing led us, nineteen brothers in total, each armed with guns, to attempt to rob in the waters of Bai Ban Yang.</p>
<p>Sent to the Bureau for Investigation "We then hijacked the wooden ship and forced it to sail to Shanghai, intending to return to the mountain and boast to the chieftain. Unexpectedly, we were discovered by the police, who came to suppress us. Leader Li and others then boarded a ship and fled elsewhere. However, at that time, I happened to be going to Pudong for business, so I didn't notice, which led to our arrest by the police when we were returning to the ship on a sampan. If the government wants to destroy our stronghold, it must go there on warships. We can lead you there to capture them. Otherwise, not only will you not succeed, but our lives will also be difficult to protect," and so on. Another pirate, named Li Laowu, age 19, confessed. And still another pirate, named Li Zhenglai, of the same age as Laowu, confessed. The rest of their statements were the same as Li Chenglai's. Considering the extreme importance of this case, an official document was immediately prepared, and the prisoners were sent to the bureau for interrogation at approximately 4:00 PM that afternoon.</p>
<h3>Huang Fenghao Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Rescued at Caijiaqiao, Zhenru</p>
<p>Detective Team Captures Several Kidnappers</p>
<p>Huang Fenghao, a local accountant at the Xinxing Milk Shed at No. 1040 Great West Road in Shanghai, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits at the intersection of Dunxin Road at 5:15 PM on the 26th of this month and disappeared without a trace. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. After the incident, Detective Team Leader Lu Ying and Sixth District Chief Tan paid close attention. They ordered Tang Bingxiang, the head of the Sixth District Detective Team, to investigate. In just two days, the hostage was rescued, and five kidnappers and two pistols were captured. The details of the successful resolution of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Joint Investigation Because the incident occurred within the boundaries of the road being built across the border, the head of the Jing'an Temple police station dispatched Chinese Deputy Inspector Fan Defu to investigate the scene on the afternoon before last. At the time, Team Leader Tang also went to the scene. They jointly inquired with Wang Baocheng, the clerk of the Asia Gas Station there. They learned that the car used by the kidnappers was a black-plated number 400, but the last character was not clearly remembered.</p>
<p>Clues to Solving the Case The police station then investigated numbers 4001 to 4010 based on this number. Only the owner of car number 4003, Shen Guanquan, a local resident living at No. 1798 Jing'an Temple Road, who worked as a driver, was suspected. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Shen. A telephone call was made to the Sixth District, and Team Leader Tang personally went to bring Shen back to the district.</p>
<p>Kidnappers Arrested According to Shen Guanquan's confession, the car, number 4003, was rented to a man named Zhu Sanmao through a friend named Shen Jingen. Zhu lived at No. 10 Wangjia Lane, Yidingpan Road, and so on. After obtaining the confession, Team Leader Tang, at midnight the night before last, led detectives Sun Shucheng, Zhou Wenhai, Cao Chuqiao, Zhang Yuzhu, and police sergeant Shen Jinzhang, disguised themselves and secretly went to the address. Zhu Sanmao, Shen Jingen, and Mao Qiushen were successively arrested and brought back to the district. According to the confession of Shen and Zhu, Huang Fenghao was kidnapped and is currently hidden in a straw hut at Caijiaqiao, Zhenru. They could lead the way.</p>
<p>Hostage Rescued After obtaining the confession, Team Leader Tang reported to District Chief Tan and, along with the original detective team, rushed to Caijiaqiao at 4:00 AM yesterday. They first surrounded the house and then bravely rushed in. They rescued the hostage, Huang Fenghao, and arrested the kidnappers guarding him, Wu Jie, Chen Adi, and Zhao Linsheng, on the spot. They also seized two pistols, thirteen rounds of ammunition, and a pair of sunglasses, and brought them all back to the district. Huang's family was then notified to come to the district to retrieve Huang. After separate interrogation by the district officers, it was decided to prepare an official document and send them to the bureau for interrogation. The kidnapped car was also found yesterday morning on Rue Père Robert in the French Concession and was retrieved by the detective team after notification from the French police station.</p>
<h3>The Zhu Baoyuan Estate Dispute Continues</h3>
<p>The Dispute Centers on Investigating the Accounts</p>
<p>Rescheduled for Further Questioning of Witnesses on January 10</p>
<p>Zhu Baoyuan, a native of Hai'ning and owner of the Zhenhe Tea Firm, passed away in April of this year, leaving an estate of over 2.7 million yuan. His two eldest sons, Zhu Yanqing and Zhu Shunqing, controlled the estate, while his second wife, Zhu Xinxinbao, and his three unmarried daughters were not allowed to share in the estate. They were all resentful and successively filed lawsuits with the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering Yanqing and Shunqing to hand over the entire estate for distribution according to shares. Later, the brothers Yanqing enlisted people to mediate, so their two married sisters, having each received 80,000 yuan, withdrew their lawsuits. However, the amount requested by their stepmother, Zhu Xinxinbao, was over 600,000 yuan. Although Fang Jiaobo and others had acted as mediators, the lack of sincerity on the part of Yanqing and others rendered the efforts fruitless. Moreover, the defendants</p>
<p>Repeatedly Failed to Appear in Court Therefore, the matter remains unresolved to this day. Recently, the plaintiff submitted a request to the court for an order requiring the defendant to submit a list of all assets for verification. The Zhu brothers, knowing that they could not simply gloss over the matter, had to comply. However, the plaintiff was extremely dissatisfied with the list. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan held a further hearing. At that time, the plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Ying, pointed out the shortcomings in the list one by one and attacked them, leading to a heated debate with the defendant's lawyer. According to Lawyer Chen, during the previous court hearing, the court had granted permission for the plaintiff to participate in the examination of the accounts. My lawyer then agreed with the other party to go to the Zhenhe Tea Firm at 9:30 AM on the 25th to examine the accounts opened by the defendant,</p>
<p>Item by Item Scrutiny He also submitted five or six account books, such as the temporary guest ledger of Zhenhe Tea Firm, but they were all from last year. The account books from this year were not submitted at all. Only one monthly statement was provided, which was from this year. In the monthly statement, the rent item for January was recorded as over 360,000 taels of silver, while in June, because the currency had been changed from taels to yuan, it was recorded as over 360,000 yuan. If calculated based on silver and yuan, this one item alone is off by over 100,000. Other properties in Shanghai and Hangzhou, and the amount of monthly rent received from them were asked of the defendant, but he was unwilling to disclose them. Over 400,000 yuan of domestic public bonds, currently worth 280,000 yuan, and its location were not stated. The total amount of foreign stocks was over 250,000 yuan. It was said that 20,000 yuan had been mortgaged. Whether it was completely mortgaged or only a portion had been mortgaged was not stated even when asked. In addition, there were various stocks worth over 36,000 yuan, which were also not disclosed,</p>
<p>Location of Assets The defendant's intention at the time was to simply submit a few ordinary account books and pass them off as a perfunctory effort, not a sincere examination of the accounts. Zhu Yanqing had always managed these shared assets, so he was naturally familiar with the details. Now, he repeatedly said that he did not know, which was clearly an excuse. There was also an item in the accounts for a loan of 50,000 taels of silver from the Asia East Bank, which was said to be borrowed from the Renji Company opened by Shi Shaochu. However, according to what the plaintiff knew, the company was actually founded by Baoyuan with his own funds. Therefore, he requested that Shi Shaochu be summoned to court next time to testify. In short, what is in dispute in this case</p>
<p>The amount of the estate The plaintiff had long asserted that it was over 2.7 million yuan. Even based on the list submitted by the defendant, it was over 900,000 yuan. Therefore, there must be many account books, certainly not just the ones submitted by the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff should now request two things from the court: (1) The defendant should submit all account books from previous years completely, without concealing anything; (2) The plaintiff should be allowed to bring an accountant to the Zhenhe Tea Firm to verify the accounts. The defendant's representative lawyer strongly opposed both of the plaintiff's requests, stating that Baoyuan's estate was not as large as the plaintiff claimed and that there were no handwritten account books of assets. Zhenhe was still in operation, so this year's account books could not be submitted under any circumstances. If the accounts were to be forcibly seized, then Zhenhe would</p>
<p>Inevitably be Forced to Close At that time, Zhenhe's debt of 240,000 yuan would have to be repaid, and the debt of 260,000 yuan would likely be sacrificed. Would the plaintiff be willing to bear this loss? Therefore, the defendant strongly opposed the seizure of the account books. He could not agree to the examination of the accounts with an accountant, because the plaintiff's lawsuit was for the division of the estate, not for the investigation of the accounts. Why should he add extra complications? Therefore, he firmly opposed it. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that in order to divide the estate, it was necessary to first examine the accounts in order to understand whether the defendant had concealed any assets. Baoyuan did have handwritten account books of assets, which were taken by the defendant after his death when the plaintiff moved out of the house. The plaintiff should testify in court, and so on. The two lawyers debated with each other for a long time. Finally, it was requested that the defendant be summoned to court next time and that additional witnesses be summoned, which Judge Qiao approved. It was already late in the evening. The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for January 10.</p>
<h3>Measures for the China Child Welfare Association to Rescue Young Prostitutes</h3>
<p>Three Rescue Measures Proposed</p>
<p>To be Implemented After Government Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Child Welfare Association will conduct an on-site investigation of young prostitutes starting on January 1 of the 23rd year of the Republic, and will request that the government provide practical and financial assistance so that young prostitutes have the opportunity to be educated. The outline of the measures to rescue young prostitutes is as follows: (1) On-site investigation: The association, together with government officials, will investigate the living conditions of prostitutes in the Public Concession, the British Concession, the French Concession, the border between the Chinese and Foreign concessions, and the wharves of land and water transportation, ascertain the proportion of young prostitutes, report to local authorities, and find ways to take them in; (2) Establishment of a reporting office: The association plans to rent a house near the Great World to serve as the office address. Prostitutes who cannot bear the suffering and suddenly realize their situation can report themselves, or others can report on their behalf. After their grievances have been redressed, they will be sent to a training institute for care; (3) Establishment of a training institute: Prostitutes whose grievances have been redressed by the association can be sent to a training institute. In addition to providing them with appropriate education every day, they will also be taught simple crafts so that prostitutes who suddenly realize their situation can have the opportunity to acquire skills and general knowledge. Those whose addresses have been ascertained will be taken back by their families. Those whose addresses are unknown will be introduced by the association to appropriate jobs. It is understood that these measures will be implemented after being approved by the government authorities.</p>
<h3>A Buyout's Fraudulent Scheme of Setting Up a Shipping Company in a Small Room</h3>
<p>Issuing Tens of Thousands of Dollars in Bad Checks</p>
<p>Rice Shops and Leather Shops All Defrauded of Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>Recently, a man named Wang Zhihua from Zhenhai, Ningbo, 34 years old, due to extreme boredom, conceived a whimsical idea. Inside No. 4 Dongtingshan Lane, Guanyao Bridge, South City, in collusion with his sworn brothers Qiu Haining, Zhang Wenzong, Yu Afu, and Shi Asi, he raised funds to fraudulently establish an Xiangshan Shipping Bureau. Wang served as the manager and hired Qiu Aliul and Shi Lichen as partners. They rented a large through-room, inside which were arranged many new-style writing desks, and the four walls were covered with red silk banners celebrating the opening, appearing to be a newly opened shipping bureau. On the one hand, they rented a new Yili steamship from Lifsing to exclusively run the Shanghai and Dinghai line. By this means, they recruited dozens of staff members and tea servants, collected security deposits, and issued bad checks to defraud merchants of goods, totaling approximately 10,000 yuan. Wang and others, taking advantage of the voyage of the rented new Yili steamship to Dinghai on the 27th of this month, absconded with the defrauded goods and money, leaving no trace. Therefore, the defrauded households have not yet been able to take action. There are three cases that have already been discovered. The first case involved the Shengyi Rice Shop at the Great Wharf in South City. On the 26th of this month, a person suddenly came, claiming to be Shi Lichen, the accountant of the Xiangshan Shipping Bureau, who had come to purchase 30 dan of white rice because the bureau needed it. Seeing a large customer coming to the door, the shop provided diligent service and dispatched workers to transport 30 dan of the best white rice (totaling 208 silver dollars) to the bureau. The bureau then issued a check dated the 27th from the Hongxiang Yuji Money Exchange, totaling 208 silver dollars. The next day, the rice shop dispatched worker Qu Gutang to the Hongxiang Bank to cash the check. Unexpectedly, the bank replied that the Xiangshan Shipping Bureau had no funds deposited in the bank. Qu immediately rushed to the bureau to negotiate, but the bureau's manager, Wang Zhihua, had already fled without a trace. At this point, Qu realized that he had been defrauded. He immediately grabbed Shi Lichen, the accountant dispatched by the bureau to purchase the white rice. At the same time, the second case followed closely. On the 26th of this month, the Xianda Rice Shop on Lijie Street at the Great Wharf was also induced by the bureau to dispatch a person to purchase 20 dan of white rice, totaling 138 silver dollars. Afterwards, they also gave the same check that could never be cashed. Upon discovering this, they immediately dispatched worker Wang Changsheng to rush to the bureau to negotiate. He caught sight of the scene and immediately joined forces with Shengyi Rice Shop worker Qu Gusheng to take Shi to the First District General Office. After a preliminary trial by District Chief Guan Gong, he ordered the preparation of an official document and sent them to the bureau for interrogation. Unexpectedly, on the same day (the 27th), shareholder Yu Afu of the bureau went to the Tianqingfu Leather Goods Bureau at Xiaodongmen, falsely claiming that he wanted to purchase several of the best-quality leather furs. Hu Weichu, a partner of the bureau, came out to greet him and took out several of the best-quality leather furs for him to choose from. As a result, they selected five valuable leather furs, such as gray squirrel and gray-backed tan skins, totaling 610 silver dollars. Hu was ordered to send them to the Xiangshan Shipping Bureau, and the bureau issued a check dated the 28th from the Hongxiang Bank, totaling 610 silver dollars. Hu did not suspect anything and returned with the check. Unexpectedly, at approximately 4:00 PM on the 28th (the day before yesterday), when he went to the Hongxiang Bank to cash the check, he was again refused. Realizing that he had been defrauded, he quickly rushed to the bureau, only to find that they had all fled without a trace, and the leather goods were no longer inside the bureau. Only a partner named Qiu Aliul was there guarding the gate. The partner was taken to the First District General Office, and during interrogation by District Chief Guan, Qiu Aliul confessed that Manager Wang Zhihua currently lived in a small room at a certain number in Chongbenli, Guanyao Bridge. The police were immediately dispatched to arrest him, but Wang had already fled upon hearing the news and was not apprehended. His wife, Wang Shi, was taken to the district for questioning. She claimed to know nothing about her husband's actions. It was apparent that the so-called manager of a shipping bureau would not condescend to live in a small room. It was clear that he intended to set up a fraudulent scheme to defraud goods and money. He ordered the preparation of an official document and sent all the people to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. At the same time, he ordered strict pursuit and arrest of the five major fraudsters, including Wang, so that they could be brought to justice.</p>

<h3>A Young Man Attempts Suicide Over Love</h3>
<p>Secretly Taking Sleeping Pills to Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Sent to the Hospital for Treatment, Fortunately Resurrected</p>
<p>Li Yuanshan from Ningbo, currently seventeen years old, is an apprentice at a certain domestic goods company in the Penglai Market of this city. He usually has a refined appearance, and being a handsome young man, he has quite a reputation. However, Li is by nature amorous, and his romantic inclinations were awakened early. The foreign entertainment venues by the sea are the easiest place for young people to fall into decline. Thus, Li's footsteps were a daily occurrence in the alleys of pleasure. Furthermore, with his family's wealth, he spent lavishly. Girls love beauty, and pimps love money. Having both, he fell deeper and deeper into decline. There was a Suzhou girl, Xu Jinxian, who was a high-achieving student at a certain girls' school. Now, due to her family's decline, she had no choice but to enter the world of prostitution. She and Li made a vow of love, and he immediately redeemed her and built a love nest in the Shanjiayuan on Baker Road. They were so deeply in love that they seemed to prefer being mandarin ducks to being immortals. Li's family initially did not know about this. Recently, Li's mother, Zhang, believed that her son's immersion in sensual pleasures would ultimately lead to ruin. Therefore, she arranged a marriage for him with the daughter of a certain leather shop owner, Wang, who opened a shop in Sanpailou in the city. The wedding day was set. Initially, Li strongly opposed it, but because he was young, he could not defy his mother's wishes and could only reluctantly agree. When he heard that the wedding day was set, he felt compelled to directly tell his mother his feelings. However, his mother was stubborn and not only refused to allow it but also reprimanded him severely. Li, frustrated by this setback, felt that life was meaningless. One night, he secretly took many sleeping pills in his bedroom. Soon after, the poison took effect, and he began to groan. His mother heard him and immediately sent him by carriage to Renji Hospital in Maijiaquan. Fortunately, he received effective treatment, and his life may be saved. Three suicide notes were found on Li's body, one to his teacher (the manager of the certain domestic goods company), one to his lover Xu Jinxian, and one to his uncle surnamed Huang. The contents were mostly words such as "rather die than be without freedom," and the language was poignant and well-written. A fine young man willing to die for love is pitiable, but his actions are foolish.</p>
<h3>Spitting Out Three Taels of Silver</h3>
<p>A Worker at the Mint Has a Clever Plan</p>
<p>But Escapes the Eyes of the Inspectors</p>
<p>The Central Mint in Gaochang Temple in the South City has been working day and night to produce silver coins. One night recently (the 28th) at about 1:00 AM, the night shift ended, and the workers left the factory one after another. The inspectors checked the workers as usual. Among them were workers Su Jianting (from Ningbo), 40 years old, and Zhang Rongfu (also from Ningbo), 32 years old. The two had cigarettes in their mouths. The inspectors saw that Su and Zhang looked flustered and immediately searched them. They found nothing. They ordered them to open their mouths and saw that Su Jianting spit out a small piece of silver wrapped in paper, weighing about three taels. Zhang Rongfu spat out a piece of silver from his mouth, weighing about three taels. Both were about an inch square. The men and the loot were immediately detained and reported to the factory director. Yesterday, a formal document was prepared, and the two suspects, Su and Zhang, along with the two small pieces of silver, were transferred to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>The Case of Datong Steamship Company Refusing to Register Members</h3>
<p>The Labor Union Believes the Actions of Zhengda Steamship Company's Comprador Are Absurd</p>
<p>The Company Issued a Statement Claiming No Obstruction</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that regarding the case of the Datong Steamship Company's Zhengda steamship refusing to register members of the labor union, the Maritime Workers' Union held a committee meeting yesterday to discuss how to respond. The company also issued a statement about the incident. Details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Response Measures: The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, after receiving a report from the Shanghai branch that the Zhengda steamship's comprador was obstructing the registration of seamen, raised the issue for discussion at the regular meeting yesterday. The proposal stated that the Datong Steamship Company last year, under the pretext of criminal punishment, dismissed four middle-class workers, Jiao Liangcai and others, from the Longda and Zhida steamships. Since the establishment of the union, the workers have repeatedly expressed their suffering and requested reinstatement. After negotiations with the company for several months, there has been no result.</p>
<p>In addition, the order to prevent the registration of seamen, how should it be dealt with? The resolution was: (1) Hand it over to the Guidance Section to send cadres to continue the registration together with the Shanghai branch; (2) Confidential; (3) Send a letter to the Datong Company to inform Zhu Zuoting not to obstruct the labor movement; (4) Regarding the dismissal issue of Jiao Liangcai and others, based on legal points, continue to negotiate with the company; (5) Confidential.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Expresses: Secretary Hou Dachun of the Maritime Workers' Union told the Xinsheng News Agency reporter that the Maritime Workers' Union was organized by the central government and its purpose is to lead and protect the seamen. Carrying out registration is even done by order. Unexpectedly, the Zhengda comprador is actually obstructing it, which is absurd, and even forcing seamen to sign voluntary letters stating that they will not join the union, and confiscating their badges. The union is the leading group of seamen and has the power to correct mistakes. At this time, please continue to persuade in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible, so as not to create further complications. If they are still stubborn, the union has no choice but to submit all the evidence of resistance to the central government for processing.</p>
<p>The Company Defends: The Datong Company issued a statement stating that the company does not prevent or force the cabin boys of the ships from joining the seaman's union, and gives them absolute freedom. Last week, the union sent many people to wait for the ships to arrive, and as soon as the ship arrived, they went aboard and ordered the cabin boys to sign up. On the 21st of this month, the Zhida ship arrived at the port, and the union members again used their old tricks. At this time, it was during the unloading of cargo and passengers, and the cabin boys were very busy with their work. If the union members kept harassing the cabin boys, the order would be disrupted. As a result, they forced one cabin boy, Long Da, to sign up and leave. On the 22nd, the Zhengda ship arrived at the port. In advance, only twenty or more union members went to meet Mr. Zhu, the business director of the ship, claiming to persuade the ship's cabin boys to join the union and asking for assistance. Mr. Zhu replied that whether the cabin boys of the company's ships join the union or not is entirely up to them. If the cabin boys wish to join the union, the company will not prevent them. If they do not wish to join the union, the company is not in a position to force them. The union members replied that it would be good to handle it this way. After Zhengda docked, please ask the cabin boys to introduce them. Mr. Zhu said that the ship had just arrived at the port, and the cabin boys were working and could not be obstructed. After the cargo and passengers were unloaded, I will accompany you on the ship. When Zhengda arrived, a large number of union members went on board immediately. At the same time, Mr. Zhu also boarded the ship. After Mr. Zhu summoned all the cabin boys of the ship, he explained the union's intentions on their behalf. All the cabin boys, after listening, voluntarily expressed that they did not wish to join the union, and then dispersed.</p>

He sent inspectors and police chiefs to investigate secretly, but the gamblers were well-informed and had many hideouts, so they were not caught. At 12:00 AM the night before, Inspector Zhang Panchi suddenly went to inspect and saw a lot of noise in Room 19 on the third floor of the Central Hotel.

<h3>A Girl is Run Over and Killed by a Tram</h3>
<p>A Road Worker is Unable to Rescue Her</p>
<p>His Right Hand and Foot Are Also Crushed</p>
<p>The section of East Xihua Road in the middle of Gongping Road and Maohai Road has recently been ordered by the Engineering Department of the Public Works Bureau to send road workers to repair the road. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday at about 4:00 PM, the woman Cao Yin, who lived at No. 38 Longqing Li on that road, had a daughter named Cao Zhaodi, who was only five years old and was playing alone in the middle of the road. At that time, as she was about to cross the road from north to south, a tram No. 77 driven by Sheng Weibin was speeding from the west. He was unable to brake in time and knocked the child down. At the same time, Tang Deming, a road worker from Anhui Province, 23 years old, who was repairing the road there, could not bear to see the child being hit and risked his life to rescue her. But it was too late. The child was crushed and killed. Tang's right hand and foot were also crushed. At the time, West Three Road Toutou No. 303 of the Huishan Patrol Room was also sitting in the car. Suddenly hearing about the accident, he immediately got out of the car, investigated, and reported it to the police station in charge, and ordered an ambulance to send the injured Tang Deming to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After bandaging, he left the hospital. The child's body was sent to the Philan Road Mortuary for an autopsy by detectives who came to investigate. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Diao Chengtang was dispatched to the mortuary by the First Special District Local Court. After examining the body, he took a statement from Tang Deming, who said that he was a road worker and that they were repairing the road at that time. When he saw the child being hit, he wanted to pull her away, but he was also hit and did not know how his hands and feet were injured. Sheng Weibin also said that he was driving the tram and was driving slowly because there were many road workers repairing the road on both sides. The child suddenly ran out from among the workers, so he did not see her. By the time he braked, it was too late. The child's mother, Cao Yin, said that she was washing clothes at home at the time and did not know that the child had gone out. Now that she has been hit and killed, she asked the tram company to provide a coffin and pay for the injured worker's medical expenses. After hearing the statements, Mr. Diao ruled that the deceased girl, Cao Zhaodi, was indeed crushed in the head by the tram No. 77 while she was alive and died. He ordered her mother, Cao Yin, to sign a guarantee to take back the coffin and bury it.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Southern Goods Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Southern Goods Industry Association held its 24th executive and supervisory meeting at its premises the day before yesterday. Chairman Gong Jingyan reported on incoming and outgoing documents and then began discussions on: (1) Based on the report from the Evaluation Committee: (A) Member Zaiyang Company has been having a major sale for many days. Staff were sent to advise them, but they refused to accept. This is a deliberate violation of industry regulations. The evidence is conclusive and should be strictly handled. It was resolved to implement Article 7 of Chapter 4 of the industry regulations, revoke their market license, and announce in the newspaper the cancellation of their membership, and report to the higher authorities for record. (B) Yichang Company held a major sale, which led Longchang Company to follow suit, greatly affecting the business of fellow traders. Regarding how to handle this case, it was resolved that the association should request the higher authorities to appoint officials to go with the association's staff to forcibly remove all the lanterns of both parties. The fine will be discussed later. (C) Member Hengsheng Company had hung lanterns, although they have been removed, the prices of goods still do not comply with the association's regulations. Regarding how to handle this case, it was resolved that the company has evidence of price disruption and should be fined 50 yuan in accordance with Article 1 of the industry regulations, as a warning to others. (D) Regarding how to handle cases where non-members of the association violate industry regulations and disrupt prices, it was resolved that the association should send a letter to all the dismantling companies to refuse to trade with them. Accordingly, the above cases were resolved in principle. (2) The association's articles of association were submitted to the higher authorities for approval and record at the time of establishment. Now, the Social Bureau has ordered that several articles should be amended (full text of the proposal), but Article 20 states that the association's income consists of the following items as membership fees: (1) Membership fee of 2 yuan; (2) Monthly membership fee is divided into two types: A 2 yuan, B 1 yuan. According to Committee Member Shen's proposal, the association's finances are indeed insufficient and should be changed to membership fees of four types: A, B, C, and D: 40 yuan for 15 or more people (A), 30 yuan for 10 or more people (B), 20 yuan for 5 or more people (C), and 10 yuan for 2 or more people (D). Monthly membership fees should be based on the number of people using the service, with each person charged 3 jiao per month. Committee Member Xu seconded the motion, and it was resolved to pass it. (3) Discussion: According to the bamboo shoot industry, the price of goods has always been based on the "yue pan" (agreement) as the standard. Recently, due to the Fujian Incident, transportation has been inconvenient, and the "yue pan" needs to be increased by 20%. Regarding what the association should do, it was resolved that the increase in the price of bamboo shoots is a major issue and it was decided to convene a meeting of member representatives on January 5, 23rd year of the Republic, to discuss solutions. The meeting adjourned without discussing other matters.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In the local news column of your newspaper on the 25th of this month, there was a news item about the Guangxin Dyeing Factory in Lujiabang being bombed, which is somewhat inaccurate. Our factory has always promoted national goods and is determined to expand. It is purely self-woven and self-dyed. Because the original factory site in Lujiabang was insufficient, we built a factory base in Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei, as early as this month, and moved into the new site on the 17th of this month. The machines left at the Lujiabang factory site were taken over by Dahua Dyeing Factory. Therefore, the bombing of the Fuxin Dyeing Factory has nothing to do with our factory. I am writing to request that you publish it in the correction column of your newspaper to avoid confusion. Sincerely, Xin Xin Shengji Dyeing and Weaving Factory Distributor, December 29th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper published a news item on December 13th about the collision between the Wanxiang and Luan Small Ships, and the criticism of me is deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings. I am writing to request a correction and hope you will publish it. The captain of a ship sailing in the outer sea should be fully responsible for driving. However, because the Yangtze River estuary has uncertain currents and depths change from time to time, the ships are driven by Da Er leading the river. Therefore, the collisions and groundings that occur on the way are the responsibility of the leading river on duty. The grounding in Qingpu was actually caused by the leading river mistakenly taking the route. The Wanxiang's collision, the right and wrong are yet to be judged, and the parties involved are the leading river, not the captain. Anyone with a little nautical knowledge knows this. After the incident, all the crew members of this ship engaged in rescue. After the rescue was completed, at 7:50 AM, the anchor was lifted and the ship sailed upstream. At 8:30 PM, it arrived in Han. If the shipowner Leading River hides, the helmsman is beaten, as your newspaper claimed, then who is responsible for lifting the anchor and driving ashore on the way? I hereby write to you, and wish you peace. Sincerely, Weng Jiqing, Captain of the Wanxiang Ship of the Sanbei Company, to the Editor-in-Chief of Shenbao, December 29th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Today, I found in your newspaper the news that the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory refused workers to return to work, which was submitted by the Industrial Society. This is not in line with the facts. The party and government authorities have public records of the workers' withdrawal from insurance. In addition to sending staff to directly negotiate with the Industrial Society, our association should ask your newspaper to correct it quickly in order to relieve workers' difficulties and maintain the credibility of the newspaper. Sincerely, Guo Junchen, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Second District Rubber Products Industry Union, to the Editor-in-Chief of Shenbao.</p>

<h3>The Next Year's Plan for Railway Business and Intermodal Transportation (Continued)</h3>
<p>(G) Adding Refrigeration Equipment Our country's railways have never had refrigeration transportation equipment, so that fresh goods such as vegetables, fruits, fish, and meat produced on each line cannot be sold smoothly in other places. What is surplus here is exactly what is needed there. The supply and demand is unbalanced, the rural economy is declining day by day, and it is difficult for railway transportation to flourish. Now, in order to solve the problem of regulating the food supply and assisting the rural economy, and at the same time open up a new path for railway business, it seems that it is necessary to quickly carry out refrigeration transportation on the national railways. However, to carry out refrigeration transportation, it is necessary to add equipment such as refrigerated cars and refrigerated warehouses, which requires huge funds and is not easy to raise at once. Now, a plan has been drawn up to be completed in four phases, requiring a total of more than 1.84 million yuan. The funds required in the first year are more than 490,000 yuan, more than 320,000 yuan in the second year, more than 330,000 yuan in the third year, and more than 690,000 yuan in the fourth year. As for the construction steps, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line has a dense population and a great demand for fresh goods. Moreover, it is closer to the capital and easier to supervise and manage. It is appropriate to give priority to it as a model. Therefore, it is planned to complete it in the first year. The second year has entered the expansion period. In order to make the intermodal transportation of fresh goods developed, the railways connected to it should be continued first. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway is the main north-south line, and the Capital Ferry is now open, so it should be completed in the second year. In the third year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Jiaoji, and Longhai Railways, which are close to the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways, should be continued. The fourth year is the completion period. It is expected that the Guangdong-Guizhou Railway will be completed at that time and will be linked with the Pinghan Railway to form an important north-south line. Therefore, it is planned to complete it in the fourth year.</p>
<p>(H) Holding Exhibitions of Products along the Railway Lines in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao The prosperity or decline of a country's railway business is closely related to the prosperity or decline of the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining industries along the line. The prosperity or decline of the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining industries along the line depends on the abundance of raw materials and the breadth of sales of manufactured products. Our country has abundant resources, and it is inevitable that there will be more consumption and a wider range of raw materials. However, the places of production are often surplus, and the places of consumption are exhausted. What is discarded here is what is needed there. There is a surplus of domestic products here, and similar foreign goods are used there, causing raw materials to be discarded and industry to decline. The railway's freight volume is reduced due to the sluggishness of various commercial goods, resulting in a daily reduction in income, which is regrettable. In order to awaken the attention of merchants, balance supply and demand, and increase railway business, there is only one way to hold exhibitions of products along the national railway lines, holding them in major commercial ports and large cities in stages by means of a roving exhibition to promote them through publicity. It was held in Shanghai this spring with excellent results. It was held in Beijing this winter with even greater results. It is planned to continue to hold meetings in Beijing, Qingdao, and other places, so that merchants in various places will know the products from all over the country, as well as their quality, price, freight rate, etc., as a reference for business and to promote the progress of industry. Its contribution to the social economy is extraordinary. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ultra-Shortwave Radio Telephone</h3>
<p>— Jiancun</p>
<p>—Using Electromagnetic Vacuum Tubes Produced by Philips—</p>
<p>Scientific progress often tends towards the peculiar, and radio is no exception. It is now trending towards the review of ultra-shortwaves, and its achievements are becoming more and more remarkable. When Heinrich Hertz conducted experiments on electromagnetic oscillations in 1886-87, the wavelength used was 30 mm, the so-called ultra-shortwave, but people at that time did not know how to use this ultra-shortwave. Therefore, when radio was first put into practical use, the wavelength used was limited to long waves (20,000 to 30,000 meters). Although the use of wavelength gradually tended to be shorter, people at that time thought that only long waves could be used for long-distance communication. Little did they know that the later short waves broke the previous misconception. Not only could they satisfy long-distance communication, but the power they consumed was less than that of long waves.</p>
<p>Since then, short waves have taken the place of long waves. And its application has extended to Televiseon, physics, chemistry and medicine, and its amazing characteristics have gradually become clear. And the ultra-short wavelength we have obtained in the experiment is similar to the wavelength experimented by Hertz that year. According to the experiment conducted by the physical experiment room of the Philips factory, the result of the experiment with a wavelength of one meter is that ultra-short waves can indeed dominate our radio communication industry.</p>
<p>In the experiment, the vacuum tube used to generate the oscillation is the so-called electromagnetic vacuum tube (Magnetrons) with a special structure. The structure of the tube is shown in the figure above. A strong magnetic field is installed in the tube for oscillation. The Philips experiment room has specially designed a suitable structure and circuit diagram for the tube, so that it can be used in parallel connection to obtain extremely high efficiency.</p>
<p>The above picture shows a new type of ultra-shortwave transmitter recently produced by the Philips experiment room. The machine is connected in parallel with two electromagnetic vacuum tubes. It requires 150 watts of input, and a wavelength of about one meter can get 50% efficiency. Compared with the 4% obtained by the System of Barkhausen and Kurz using the same wavelength, the superiority of its efficiency can be seen. If it is only 4% efficiency, it is not difficult to obtain by using the transmitter shown in the figure above and using a wavelength of 55 mm.</p>
<p>Experiments on ultra-shortwaves are still ongoing, but the facts have told us that their application can extend to local broadcasting, secret communication, airway signs, airplanes, and ships for identifying directions in heavy fog.</p>
<h3>Ratio of Power to Volume (Continued)—Meaning of Deeibel—</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>That is, doubling the power of the radio can probably get three decibels.</p>
<p>Similarly, tripling the power of the radio can probably get five decibels; quadrupling the power can get six decibels; eight times the power can get nine decibels; ten times the power can only get ten decibels, or one bel.... In short, the more the power increases, the less the number of decibels increases.</p>
<p>People with special training in hearing—such as telephone engineers or musicians—can distinguish a change of only one decibel in volume. Ordinary people need a change of three decibels to be able to distinguish the size of the volume.</p>
<p>It is best to avoid mathematical proofs when discussing various scientific problems. Although the formulas borrowed in this article are very simple, I am afraid that they have already aroused the disgust of the general public. Now, in order to make it easier for readers to understand, I will give a simple analogy to explain the above-mentioned special phenomenon.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, G is a funnel-shaped glass cup, divided into ten grids. First inject one cubic inch of water, assuming it can raise the position of three grids. (That is, reach the height of the third grid) Then inject the same amount of water, because of the large top and small bottom, it will only raise two grids. (The height reaches the fifth grid) Then inject the same amount of water, it can only raise one grid... The higher you go, the less the height increases with the same amount of water added. In the last grid, it takes two cubic inches of water to increase the height by one grid.</p>
<p>Now we compare water to electricity and height to decibels, then it is not difficult to get a clear idea of the relationship between electricity and volume.</p>
<p>This article can be concluded here, but perhaps some people think that the ratio of electricity and volume becoming a logarithm is a scientific misfortune. This is true in theory, but there will be difficulties in fact. Because many noisy sounds in the society (such as gongs and drums, machine sounds, etc.) have great vibration forces. If the feeling of the size of the sound force is a certain proportion, then the brittle eardrum has probably been broken. Therefore, the vibration force and the sound becoming a logarithmic ratio is a very fortunate thing. (End)</p>
<h3>The Result of Modulation Exceeding 100%</h3>
<p>— Shi Huasheng</p>
<p>Under normal amplitude modulation, the sideband frequency is equal to half the modulation percentage multiplied by the carrier wave amplitude. Therefore, the amplitudes of the lowest and highest tones are actually exactly the same. If we now increase the modulation percentage of the broadcasting machine, then the loudness received by the radio will of course increase proportionally to the rate of increase of the modulation percentage (see the article on the importance of amplitude modulation in the previous issue). The problem now arises here: what will be the result if we increase the modulation percentage to more than one hundred percent? Then the peaks of the sound waves will be cut off. It will sound distorted, and new sidebands will be generated to cause interference. In fact, this simple method can completely disrupt other nearby radio stations on adjacent wavelengths, making it impossible for the listener to discern the music. Therefore, European radio stations, in addition to announcing the wavelength (or frequency) and power, must also report their modulation percentage. This is very important for receiving distant radio stations, because once we understand the principle, we can explain the cause of the problem. Otherwise, interference occurs suddenly, then disappears again, leaving us puzzled and unable to figure it out. In short, a percentage exceeding one hundred is undesirable, except for intentional disruption. A percentage of one hundred or close to one hundred is very beneficial in terms of loudness and can compensate for insufficient power. However, from a musical standpoint, it is better to be less than one hundred percent, such as thirty percent. A compromise of around seventy or eighty percent can take both into consideration.</p>
<h3>How to Make a Semi-Variable Shortwave Plug-In Coil</h3>
<p>— FR</p>
<p>Features: After the coil is made, its inductance and the closeness of the coupling between the two coils can be increased or decreased at will within a possible range. Because the wires are not wound on other objects, losses can be reduced, so the efficiency is higher than usual. Also, because the diameter of the coil is small, the range reached by the magnetic field lines can be reduced.</p>
<p>Materials: Still use the base of an old vacuum tube, or a specially made plug-in coil tube. For the wires, it is better to use thicker ones for hardness and low resistance: such as number 14 enameled wire is most suitable.</p>
<p>Procedure: Wind the wire in a spiral shape on a round silver-lead pencil, leaving about one or two inches at each end, and then bend it into a right angle according to the method in the attached diagram. Solder the two wire ends to the copper feet of the coil tube. As for the number of turns, it depends on the capacitance of the tuning capacitor.</p>
<p>Adjustment: To increase the inductance of the coil, reduce the distance between the turns. Otherwise, the opposite is true. To make the coupling between the two coils tighter, reduce the distance between the two coils. Otherwise, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Usage: As usual. However, after the adjustment, the position of the wires should not be changed.</p>
<p>Note: A cylinder with the same diameter as the inner diameter of the coil tube can be placed on this coil to avoid changing the position of the wires. If a copper or aluminum cylinder is used, it can not only prevent bumping, but also serve as a shield.</p>
<h3>Color Codes for Standard Wiring</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Wireless equipment circuits are becoming increasingly complex. Taking a look inside, the wiring is chaotic and crisscrossed. If a problem occurs, it is really difficult for the repairer to start. Therefore, the American International Electrical Manufacturers Association has set a standard wiring system to facilitate inspection and repair. Many American radios sold on the market now use the standard wiring system set by the association.</p>
<p>Standard wiring uses the color of the wire to distinguish which part it is connected to. B+ (amplification) is designated as red, B+ (detection) as brown, B- as black with a slight red tint, C+ as cyan, C- (low) as black and cyan, C- (high) as black with a slight cyan tint, speaker (connected to the plate end) as black with a slight brown tint, speaker (connected to the screen grid end) as brown, speaker excitation coil, one as red, A+ as black, and A- as black with a slight yellow tint.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Regulations for Middle School Student Entrance Examinations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on requests from the Jiangsu Education Department and the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for clarification of ambiguous points in the regulations for middle school student graduation entrance examinations, has issued separate explanations and directives to the relevant departments to comply with. The explanation directives are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Directive to the Jiangsu Education Department Regarding Requests for Interpretation of Ambiguities in the Regulations for Middle School Student Graduation Entrance Examinations and the Regulations for the Entrance Examination Committee: Your submission has been reviewed. The questions raised in your submission are explained point by point below: (1) If middle schools under the jurisdiction of education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities have classes that start in the spring, then graduation entrance examinations must be held twice a year. Students who repeat a grade can participate in the next entrance examination. Therefore, repeating a grade twice is, in effect, equivalent to repeating a grade for only one academic year. If parents are unable to bear the burden or students are unwilling to repeat the grade again, the original school may issue a certificate of completion of studies. (2) Senior middle schools are allowed to enroll students with equivalent academic qualifications, which has already been clearly stipulated by the Ministry in the middle school regulations and does not need to be restated in the entrance examination regulations. Junior middle school students who fail one or two subjects may take the entrance examination for higher education with equivalent academic qualifications. (3) The graduation entrance examination pass certificate is not a graduation certificate. This certificate is prepared by the department and issued within two weeks after the entrance examination for students to use for admission to higher education and examinations. The graduation certificate should be annotated with the words "passed the entrance examination," stamped by the department, and then issued by the original school. (4) The provision that members of the examination setting committee and the invigilation committee may not be filled by faculty members of schools participating in the entrance examination should still be complied with.</p>

<h3>Jinan Turmoil Spreads to the University Department</h3>
<p>Faculty and Staff Left the School Yesterday, Classes Suspended in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Authorities Indicate that the School Should Be Prioritized</p>
<p>Affiliated Middle School Department Continues Classes as Usual</p>
<p>Shanghai News reported that since the student turmoil in the affiliated middle school department of National Jinan University on the 26th of this month, which was aimed at expelling the director of the affiliated middle school, Kuang Songling, the students have calmed down and resumed classes after Director Kuang left the school. Unexpectedly, a wave of expulsions occurred again in the university department yesterday. The Shanghai News reporter obtained the details as follows:</p>
<p>Outbreak Situation The university department had classes as usual yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, around 2:00 PM, just as classes were about to begin, the students gathered in the faculty and staff office and sent representatives to demand that the faculty and staff leave the office. The faculty and staff of the school immediately left, and the students temporarily sealed off the office and suspended classes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Turmoil The Shanghai News reporter learned the following reasons for the successive turmoil in the university and middle school departments of Jinan University: It is said that Zheng Hongnian, the president of Jinan University, has been in charge of the school for many years and has spared no effort in planning and managing the material construction of the school. He has no ill feelings towards the students. However, Zheng's use of Yang Yufen and Zheng Baoning has recently been dissatisfied with by the students.</p>
<p>Authorities' Opinions The Shanghai News reporter, considering that National Jinan University is one of the famous universities in the city and the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese in our country, and that the sudden turmoil has attracted much attention from society, specially inquired about the opinions of the relevant authorities in the city on this case. According to the persons in charge of the Municipal Government and the Education Bureau, the occurrence of this matter is an unfortunate event for the education sector. They hope that faculty, staff, and students should prioritize the school, calm down, and resume classes as usual. As for the issue of the president's departure or retention, it should be resolved by the central government or the school's board of directors in order to be on the right track.</p>
<p>Middle School Classes The two departments of the affiliated middle school, senior and junior, still had classes as usual yesterday. All educational affairs are maintained jointly by the students and a portion of the faculty and staff, and the order is very good.</p>
<p>Self-Government Association Meeting The Student Self-Government Association held a meeting in the conference room on the 29th. The attendees were Yuan Qiwen, Zhou Guangwu, Xiao Guanglie, Hu Dexin, Xiong Pengnan, Zhou Shifu, Lu Guanqun, Tan Shiwei, Li Can, Zhang Guoquan, Shen Zhennian, Zhang Zhu, Jin Limu, Chen Dafa, and Zhang Shuxun. Zhou Shifu was temporarily elected chairman, and Xiong Pengnan was appointed recorder. (1) Reports: A. Chairman's report (omitted), B. Former Finance Committee Member Jin's report on income and expenditure accounts; (2) Discussion: A. Since Zheng Hongnian has been in charge of the school, there has been no construction and measures have been perverse, resulting in the current chaotic state. How should this association express its opinion on this case? (Resolved) Expel Zheng Hongnian and leave the school immediately. B. Should this association organize a school protection and Zheng expulsion committee? (Resolved) Should be organized. C. How should the school protection and Zheng expulsion committee be organized? (Resolved) Designate 20 people to organize it. The elected members are Gu Shangxiang, Zhou Shifu, Wu Junlin, Xiong Pengnan, Zhou Guangwu, Chen Jiayou, Zhu Yaohuan, Zhang Zhu, Zhang Guoquan, Zhang Shuxun, Zhou Zhaoqin, Yuan Xiangwen, Peng Qinghe, Li Qicheng, Han Shiyu, Yuan Qiwen, He Jiefu, Tan Shiwei, Huang Deguan, and Xiao Guanglie. Li Can, Chen Tianhe, Fan Xifan, three alternate members, Jin Nengxiang, Chen Zhenxiang, and Zhang Yuantai, D. Should Liu Wangsu, Director of the Accounting Department of the School of Commerce, and Sun Yue, Dean of the School of Commerce, be expelled? (Resolved) Expel and leave the school immediately. E.

From now on, all matters related to school protection and Zheng expulsion shall be handled by the School Protection and Zheng Expulsion Committee. (Resolved) Passed. G. Before the successor president arrives at the school, all classes will be suspended from today. (Resolved) Passed. Adjourned.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders Strict Investigation Shenshi News reported that the school authorities had heard about the brewing of this turmoil, so they immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education for instructions on the method during the outbreak of the turmoil (that is, after the outbreak of the middle school department turmoil). The Ministry of Education telegraphed back yesterday, stating briefly that they knew all about Shen Hai's three telegrams. It is strange that this matter was prevented early but still could not be stopped. The students causing trouble listed in the telegram, such as □□□, should be expelled. However, the academic atmosphere of the school is so bad that you should investigate and strictly investigate and report it for verification and decision. In addition to directly telegraphing Mayor Wu from the ministry to strictly maintain the school's security, a special telegram informs you, etc.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Yang's Speech After the continuation of the turmoil in the university department, the Shenshi News reporter specially visited Mr. Yang Yufen, Secretary-General of the University Department of the school. According to his statement, it is unfortunate that the university department has continued the turmoil in the middle school department. All faculty and staff have decided to maintain a consistent attitude with the president and act in accordance with the ministry's orders. The president and all faculty and staff of the school believe that this turmoil was manipulated by a small number of people, with a portion of students following suit, and that most students are still stable. The radical elements who presided over the turmoil should be strictly investigated, and the students who followed should be urged to repent. I believe that this matter is not a local issue of Jinan University, but a problem of academic style in the entire education community of China. If the Jinan University turmoil is not handled appropriately and strictly, the future of education will be on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>Puppet State Participation in Far Eastern Games, China Decides to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Philippines Invites Discussion on Puppet State Participation</p>
<p>Association Replies by Telegram, Refuses to Send Representatives</p>
<p>Manchuria, lost territory, has surprisingly formed its own sports association and sent a letter this spring requesting to join the Far Eastern Games as a member, hoping to attend the tenth competition. The matter is suspicious, and the background clearly involves a conspiracy by certain foreigners to embarrass China. The request was sent to the Philippine Athletic Association, which inquired about China's opinion. The National Sports Association of China, upon receiving the news, resolutely rejected the application on the grounds that Manchuria is not a formal nation and stated that if Japan and the Philippines disregarded its position in the League of Nations and accommodated the application, China would have no choice but to withdraw from the Far Eastern Games and would not compromise. It is now learned that last week, the National Sports Association received a telegram from the Philippine Athletic Association stating, "Regarding the requests from Vietnam, Manchuria, and the Dutch East Indies to join as members, a meeting of representatives from the three countries will be convened in the Philippines at the end of January next year to discuss solutions. Please send a representative from China to attend," and so on. The association convened a board meeting on the 26th to discuss countermeasures and decided to reply to the Philippine Athletic Association, the gist of which is as follows: "Regarding the so-called Manchurian state still being included in the new membership matter, we regret that we cannot send a representative to attend the meeting."

<h3>Good Basketball Tonight, Lianghua vs. Pirates</h3>
<p>7 PM at Xiqing</p>
<p>Yesterday at Xiqing, only two Group B matches were played. Yuezhong defeated Xiqing 23-22, winning with a last-second free throw. Evening Star defeated Elementary 59-12. The special match between Pirates and Pucheng was not held because Pucheng had already left. Tonight, Tianjin will play Pirates at 7 PM. The original Group A match between Mailing and Jiangwan has been postponed. The remaining schedule remains unchanged. The results of yesterday's matches and tonight's schedule are listed below:</p>
<p>Yuezhong defeats Xiqing: Xiqing scored first, but then Yuehan coordinated their attack, and Xu Wenkui and Tong Yuchun scored several consecutive baskets, startling the opponents. From then on, they entered the inner court and were in a superior position. Xiqing could only follow behind. At halftime, it was 16-10. When the second half began, the situation suddenly became tense. At first, both sides contested each other, but then Smith and Bowser of Xiqing gained ground, tying the score at 22. However, Bowser was both the hero and the villain, unfortunately fouling Xu Wenkui, who made the free throw before the whistle, winning 23-22 by one point, truly a "close shave."</p>
<p>Evening Star defeats Elementary: The match between Pucheng and Pirates was just a mirage. After waiting in vain until 9 PM, only the Group B match between Evening Star and Elementary was held. After a dull and lonely wait, under pressure, the Jewish player managed to squeeze in a basket, taking the lead. The score became 4-2, then 6-4, proud for a moment. However, after that, their momentum waned. Evening Star won the first half 24-8, and the final score was 59-12.</p>

<p>Inquiries to the Association</p>
<p>At this year-end and beginning, the Sino-Western Football Association has three important matches scheduled to be held at Shenyuan Stadium at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yannanping Road. Given the overcast and rainy weather, to determine whether the field is suitable for use or whether the matches will be suspended, as there is no telephone at the stadium, inquiries can be made to the association from 1 PM onward. Telephone number: (82387). The schedules for the three matches are listed below:</p>
<p>December 30th (Saturday): Youyou vs. Western Police</p>
<p>December 31st (Sunday): Jinan vs. Donghua</p>
<p>New Year's Day (Monday): Interport Trial Match</p>
<p>Postponements and Forfeits</p>
<p>International Cup: Scotland vs. Italy. Due to Italy's inability to form a team and their absence, Italy has forfeited, and Scotland has the right to replay.</p>
<p>Schottler Cup: Today's Schottler Cup match between Lax and Italian Navy, originally scheduled for Yiyuan, has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. The announcement that Donghua vs. Yiling would be played on January 2nd at Shenyuan has been cancelled. Yiling has agreed to forfeit. According to reports, the Schottler Cup match between Donghua and Yiling had already been held at the Baseball Field, with Donghua eliminating Yiling 5-0. The Sino-Western Association repeatedly announced on January 2nd that Donghua would play Yiling in the Schottler Cup at Shenyuan, which was puzzling. Now, the announcement has suddenly been cancelled, stating that Yiling is willing to forfeit, which is extremely absurd. The confusion and negligence in handling matters have reached this point.</p>
<p>Group A: Youyou vs. Western Police, originally scheduled for January 2nd for the second Shen Group match at Shenyuan, has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Zilin Cup: Shanghai Industry vs. St. Francis in the Zilin Cup, Shanghai Jiang has forfeited, and St. Francis has won.</p>
<p>Charity Match: The Shenyuan charity match raised a total net income of 4,600 yuan. The distribution of funds will be announced by the Sino-Western Association at a later date.</p>
<h3>By One Point, Hujiang Loses to Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>—Result: 30-29—</p>
<p>Hujiang University's basketball team lost to Jiaotong University by one point yesterday, with a score of 29-30. The intensity of the competition can be imagined, but the performance of both sides was not particularly outstanding. After the start of the game, Hujiang took the initiative, launching a fierce attack. Wang Dian and Shi Hengzhi scored three consecutive times, taking a commanding lead of 6-0. Jiaotong University did not show weakness. Zhou Shuan made a strong attack, scoring two points, making it 9-6. Hujiang still had the advantage, but from then on, Hujiang seemed to be plagued by bad luck, and their shots were not accurate, causing the score to stagnate. On the other hand, Jiaotong University's momentum was strong, and their energy was extraordinary, scoring repeatedly, and the score increased sharply to 15-9. Hujiang was pushed into a disadvantage, so they worked hard to make progress. Qi Bianguang and Wang Dian were under close supervision by the opponent, with little activity, and only Wang Pusheng added two points. In the first half, Jiaotong University won 17-11. In the second half, Hujiang regrouped and tried to counterattack. As expected, their momentum was great, and there was a significant improvement. Wang Pusheng took care of both the front and back and worked very hard. However, Jiaotong University had both favorable geographical location and popular support, and they also had the momentum of their previous victory, so they confronted each other on equal footing, with each side making contributions. After the score reached 30-19 (Beijing University led), Hujiang redoubled their efforts and struggled hard, and the situation improved greatly, with the score increasing repeatedly. However, it was too late, and they ultimately lost by one point, with the score being 29-30.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Lodging a Protest to Them</h3>
<p>— Chuan Yi Zhi</p>
<p>This month on the Xth, this newspaper reported: According to the International Trade Bureau's announced figures on the prices of imported perfumes and cosmetics from January to October of this year, the total has reached 1,398,664 yuan... Some people have based on this point, published articles, severely scolding women. In fact, this mere million-plus yuan consumption, aside from some high-class prostitutes who regard perfume and cosmetics as a "commodity" and an unavoidable part of their costs, isn't it mostly the idle class of young mistresses and young ladies helping their husbands or fathers spend their excess money on these consumables? The majority of women have rarely seen them spend a few dollars to buy one or two kinds of imported perfumes and cosmetics! Moreover, they—young mistresses, young ladies—have their own unspoken reasons for using them, as they want to please their husbands or lovers!</p>
<p>On June 13th of this year, a certain newspaper reported a Reuters dispatch from London: The daily cost of grooming for women in the United States exceeds 300,000 pounds sterling, totaling over 11,200,000 pounds sterling annually... This shows that women—excluding those unworthy of being called wives and misses—are wholly dependent on grooming for their livelihood, and it seems that men produce while women consume, also a natural law; no wonder the American government recognizes that wives should enjoy a large portion of their husband's wages, so from July 1st, 6/5 of the wages of the 200,000 water conservancy workers recruited by the government will be directly mailed to their wives or families (see the National News Agency's Washington dispatch on June 27th). If this is the case in America, how can China be an exception?</p>
<p>Besides, using perfumes and cosmetics requires money and effort, and the idle class of young mistresses and young ladies have plenty of money and time. I remember the jest of Li Yingbi, Qing Hefu, and the monk of Mount Fu; "Once a carpenter mistakenly hooked onto the underworld, and Yama ordered the original hooker to send him back, but the original hooker demanded a bribe and refused to go. The carpenter had nothing to give, so he thought of his former master, Shen Wansan, the richest man in his lifetime, and asked him for a loan. Wansan said: 'You are a carpenter, and you once helped me into my coffin, did you ever see me carry anything with me?'" Money is only a kind of collateral in the trading fields after the "midday market" system was overthrown. We are born naked and die in all kinds of ways, and we have never been buried with a hundred thousand in our belts. They have this "heroic" state of mind and this "free and untrammeled" view of life, and they have never suffered hardships to earn their living. My friend T is studying the manufacture of Nail Polish, and I asked him what use this has in life, and he said with a smile, "Just finding something for them to relax with!" They already have sufficient grooming skills, so if they don't spray perfume or apply cosmetics, what would you have them do?</p>
<p>Therefore, from now on, if anyone discusses Chinese modern women in the manner that Dracula discussed Chinese women, I will lodge a protest to them.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Certain Driver's Affair</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The "certain driver" mentioned here is a train driver on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. He was a naturally kind person, and his service experience and driving skills were also very adequate because railway drivers all started as stokers. However, he killed three people in a row at the same location within the same year, which almost drove him insane. Although the railway had already given him a dismissal, he still felt extremely uneasy and often beat his chest and grieved endlessly. However, this is a very bizarre story. How could he kill three people in a row at the same location? So I went to visit him and got to the bottom of this matter.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, he was assigned to be the driver of a certain train, but he suddenly fell ill. After a delay of three days, on the fourth day, he was driving a passenger train about fifty or sixty yards long from Shanghai North Station to Nanjing. When the train reached the area between two stations, he suddenly saw a person walking on the tracks ahead. So he sounded the steam whistle as a warning, assuming that this person would immediately move aside. Unexpectedly, the person ahead seemed to be deaf and continued to walk along the tracks. As the distance narrowed, he became too anxious to brake and desperately sounded the steam whistle, but the person never moved and was crushed into three pieces under the wheels. Afterward, the train staff all testified on his behalf, proving that he had indeed frantically sounded the steam whistle and had not neglected his duty. As a result, he only received a minor penalty.</p>
<p>Four or five months passed, and he gradually forgot about this incident. One midday, he was driving a passenger train again, passing between the two stations, and when he arrived at the same location where the accident had happened last time, he suddenly saw a figure swaying in the distance ahead. He took precautions and pulled the long steam whistle, continuously pulling it for about two minutes. Looking ahead again, the shadow of the person was particularly clear. So he hurriedly braked and notified the stoker to help sound the steam whistle frantically. Unexpectedly, this person was standing there as if nailed to the spot and did not move, and the train could not stop immediately, so the second tragedy occurred. He simply didn't dare to get out of the train to look. He felt that this matter was too strange. He hid in the driver's compartment and trembled as much as possible, and could no longer continue to drive the train forward. This time he was sick for half a month and received a major demerit. But soon he returned to work. Of course, he could not be transferred to another position and was still a driver. On one occasion, he was driving the overnight train, and at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, he arrived again between the two stations. In the bright sunlight, he suddenly saw a person running from the side of the road onto the tracks as if he were crazy. This time, his first action was to brake, desperately braking, regardless of the mechanics, but that person rushed towards the train, making him so frightened that he used one hand to pull the steam whistle and the other to cover his eyes, not daring to look ahead again. However, when the train stopped, an incomplete corpse had been added under the wheels. The strangest thing was that it was still in the same place as the previous two accidents, at most only a few yards apart.</p>
<h3>Cold Night</h3>
<p>— Drunken Bamboo</p>
<p>A misty drizzle drifts down in gusts. The streetlamp on the corner casts a dim, green glow. The biting northwest wind loves to be close to the poor, avoiding the wealthy in their thick fur coats. Now and then, the clang of a streetcar bell punctuates the desolate cold night.</p>
<p>By this time, the shops on both sides of the road are likely closed, due to the cold weather and slow business. The shop assistants, who have worked hard all day, spread out their bedding and burrow into their quilts – their paradise. Before long, loud snores join the sound of the wind outside, creating a symphony.</p>
<p>The snoring travels with the wind to the ears of the apprentice at the fruit stand across the street, causing him to shrink his neck. He thinks how carefree the shop assistants are, already asleep, warm and cozy. He, on the other hand, has to endure the wind every day until past midnight. Thinking this, he looks up at the boss. The boss seems to understand his meaning and glances around softly. He says, "Let's pack up!" He then looks at the money box and shakes his head.</p>
<p>The apprentice could not have wished more for these words! Instantly, the biting north wind transforms into a gentle spring breeze. He happily rushes to pack up the stall and follows the boss home to sleep.</p>
<p>At this moment, on the street corner, a homeless person, still has no place to rest despite it being eleven o'clock on a cold night. Seeing the fruit stand close, he sighs in disappointment! He thinks that no matter how late, they have a master to provide them lodging. But he, like a bird that has lost its forest, has nowhere to settle. He feels in his pocket and finds only a dozen or so copper coins, ending all fantasies of a warm bed. He resents the tall foreign buildings on both sides, unable to accommodate his small body. The world is so unfair! He walks on, filled with resentment, when suddenly he hears laughter from upstairs, coming from behind a green window shade. He looks up and sees two figures slowly, slowly, drawing closer until suddenly! They embrace. After a long while, another chuckle, and then they are two shadows again... The "wanderer" is stunned! It is as if he once had a similar experience in his own mind... He wants to shout to those behind the curtain, telling them not to indulge in this rosy dream, because behind every dream is the dim light like tonight and the struggle to survive in the northwest wind. But he lacks the courage, because the world is inherently unequal; some dream, and some wander.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-One: Murmurs by the Lamp, Earnest Advice to a Weak Daughter; A Stroll in the Mountains, Cold Eyes Observing Heroes</p>
<p>Madam Jiang pushed the small kerosene lamp on the table to the side, letting Guizhi have more light. She held the fabric with both hands and looked at Guizhi for a long while, smiling faintly: "People say, read the news, read the news. You found this old newspaper to read. This isn't reading news, it's reading old news. How many characters do you even know? And you're reading a newspaper!" Guizhi said, "This is a newspaper that old master found, Xiao Lin brought it over. I was bored, so I read it to pass the time. I read the parts I know, and I don't read the parts I don't know." Madam Jiang said, "Why would Xiao Lin bring you a newspaper for no reason?" Guizhi didn't raise her head, but slightly lifted her eyelids and smiled at her mother: "It's not hard to understand, it's just to let me see the news on the newspaper, saying that the area outside the pass is now peaceful." Madam Jiang, upon hearing this, kept her hands on her lap and nodded slightly, expressing her approval. She then said, "People like Old Master Zhao are truly loving to their children. Now that we're related, just for the old man's good intentions, we should treat him well. As the saying goes, one good turn deserves another." Guizhi put her hand on the newspaper, looked at her mother, and said, "What do you mean by that? I don't understand." Although she said this, her eyes remained on the newspaper, not paying attention to her mother. Madam Jiang raised her head slightly and sighed. As she sighed, her eyes stopped looking at her daughter and instead looked at the kerosene lamp shade. After a while, she said to herself, "There are too many idle people on Haidian Street, who stir up trouble for no reason, wanting to talk about the East family's long suits and the West family's short suits. If your family has any shortcomings, then that's it, they'll add some oil and salt, and the joke will be even bigger. As the saying goes: There's a lot of gossip at a widow's door. I'm a widow, and my daughter is an only child, sigh! We must be careful in everything. Although it's the age of reform, you still have to see what it is. For women, talking about the three obediences and four virtues is acceptable anywhere." (281)</p>
<p>Artistic Traces</p>
<h3>Memories of a Trip to Fujian (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— SY</p>
<p>Fuzhou lacquerware is exquisite and delicate, famous throughout the provinces, but the price is very expensive. When people from other provinces go to buy it, they often have to pay more than double. In terms of food, Fujian cuisine is also known for being elaborate, but the prices are not cheaper than those in Shanghai's Fujian restaurants. The rice cooked in homes and restaurants here is almost like pearls, with each grain separate and completely lacking stickiness. We are really not used to eating this kind of rice. It is said that when they cook rice, after the rice is put into the pot, once the water boils, they pour out or discard the sticky rice water, or it is bought by laundries to use for washing clothes. So the rice is inedible, but the washed clothes are particularly well cared for.</p>
<p>The water used for bathing in Fuzhou is entirely from hot springs, like Tangshan in Nanjing. The water has a slight sulfur smell, which is very beneficial to people's health. Therefore, the bathhouses here are also very famous. There is a road in the city called Hot Spring Road, where the most hot spring bathhouses in Fuzhou are located. The most modern one is the Mingyuan Bathhouse of the Baihe Company. Each bath has a room, or two baths share a room. Both men and women can go, but women are separated and have female attendants to greet them. Outside the bathhouse rooms, there is a lotus pond, rockeries, and trees. The scenery is extremely serene and beautiful.</p>
<p>Small West Lake is near the West Gate. There are not many trees, but there is a teahouse that can accommodate ten people for resting. More than a dozen small boats are placed in the center of the lake. As the sun sets, pairs of lovers sit side by side in the boats, drifting on the lake. There is not much else to describe. Compared to West Lake in Hangzhou, it is worlds apart.</p>
<p>About thirty li from the provincial capital is Drum Mountain, which is extremely famous in Fuzhou. However, it is impossible to return on the same day. You need to stay on the mountain for at least one day. When we went, there were six men and two women. We hired two cars and sped to the foot of the mountain. Everyone bravely started climbing the mountain, but before reaching halfway, most of them were unable to walk. So, they switched to shoulder carriers and continued their efforts. Unexpectedly, the weather turned bad, and it started to drizzle. In an instant, it rained harder and harder. At this time, we were halfway up the mountain, and we could not retreat. We had no choice but to be soaked by the rain. So, when we reached the mountain, we were all like drowned chickens. There is a very large temple on the mountain, but unfortunately, I have forgotten its name at this moment. When we arrived, many monks were performing Buddhist rituals. Listening to the sounds of the sutras, everyone suddenly had some great insights. We all borrowed monk robes from the temple and took a group photo in monk attire. Only the two misses refused to act as nuns temporarily, no matter what. We had no choice but to give up. We stayed overnight in the Mingyue Tower in the temple. In the tower, we discovered two things: a rat as big as a cat and a spider as big as a bowl. When the huge spider was discovered, the two misses screamed in fright. Overnight, we only heard the sound of rain, and the mosquitoes kept us from sleeping soundly. By dawn, the rain had slowed down slightly. We each took a short walk around and went down the mountain to return. It can be said that we came with enthusiasm and returned disappointed. We still did not get to appreciate the famous mountain. When I went to Fuzhou for the second time, I heard that there had been kidnappings at Drum Mountain, so we could not go.</p>
<p>The first time I went, I did not plan to stay long, so after a few days, I returned to Shanghai. The second time, I planned to stay longer, but as soon as I arrived in Fuzhou, the Communists were causing trouble in Yanping, and Fuzhou was very tense. Some of our companions had brought their families, so we were so scared that we had no choice but to run to Hong Kong. At this time, I decided to wait for a ship to Shanghai and temporarily stayed at a friend's house in Cangqian Mountain. After a few days, the Wanxiang of the Sanbei Company arrived. Who knew that when I went to book a room, there were none left. Finally, I managed to get a room with the help of an acquaintance. I even boarded the ship a day in advance to avoid the crowds, but on the small steamboat to Majiang, because the ship was small and the waves were big, and it was getting dark, there was almost a dangerous situation. In the end, we arrived safely at the ship. I slept in the room all night, and at lunchtime the next day, I was carried back to Shanghai by the Wanxiang in the vast sea.</p>

<h3>From the Jianghu to the Foreign Concession</h3>
<p>— Fengzi</p>
<p>The Jianghu is the origin of hermits and chivalrous individuals.</p>
<p>After the change of dynasties, many remnants of the previous dynasty, knowing that the situation was hopeless and that they could no longer serve their masters, attached themselves to elegance and became hermits. Today they write a few poems, tomorrow they fill in a verse, raise caged birds, and plant potted flowers. This one is an "old friend of smoke and mist," and that one is a "wandering man of the Jianghu." Even young men in their twenties, as long as they can hum a few lines, are given the titles of "Taoist" or "Lay Buddhist"; as if they were going to live with smoke and water for the rest of their lives. In reality, they are just residents of the bustling city, spendthrifts of the foreign concession, lacking any real spirit of the Jianghu.</p>
<p>But who dares to say that these are not hermits!</p>
<p>In fact, nowadays, not only hermits need to escape to the foreign concession, but even chivalrous individuals need to leave the Jianghu. There are many heroes in Shanghai who stand up for others. If some girl from the countryside admires the prosperity of the city and comes to Shanghai alone, there are "generous" chivalrous individuals who volunteer to accompany her to see plays, eat snacks, and open a hotel room. In the end, they even "escort the beauty for a thousand miles," escorting her straight into a fiery pit.</p>
<p>If the family sends someone to look for her, then that's even better. Then, another group of chivalrous individuals step forward to help search in different directions; as usual, they always find her, but they can't meet, and some money needs to be used first. Once the money is in hand, they make some excuses, as if "success is just around the corner," or else they "fly away into the sky."</p>
<p>But they may not fly to the Jianghu.</p>
<p>Catching adulterers, fighting brawls, looking for quarrels, and extorting money, these are also the tasks of these chivalrous individuals of the foreign concession.</p>
<p>The foreign concession is naturally lively. Besides hermits and chivalrous individuals, there are also fortune-tellers, magicians, street performers, and peep shows. In the past, they roamed the Jianghu, now they sit in the foreign concession.</p>
<p>It seems that it is much more comfortable here, the Jianghu should be deserted!</p>
<h3>"The Reeds are Green, the White Dew is Frost" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Therefore, the first thing for a poet is to choose an object that can be used to evoke and express emotions. I remember a story in "Dream of the Red Chamber," saying that after Jia Baoyu was beaten by his father, one day, he asked Qingwen to send two old silk handkerchiefs to Lin Daiyu; Qingwen was afraid that Lin Daiyu would be annoyed and refused to send them; Jia Baoyu said: "Don't worry, she will naturally understand." Sure enough, Lin Daiyu understood the meaning of the silk handkerchiefs, and felt intoxicated, and even wrote a few quatrains on them. These two silk handkerchiefs appeared three times in "Dream of the Red Chamber"; until Lin Daiyu was dying, she tore up these two silk handkerchiefs violently, to vent her anger. Private feelings that could not be expressed in thousands of words can be expressed very intimately with just two handkerchiefs, which shows that Jia Baoyu chose them well. It is also said that a certain painter used "Raindrops falling on an empty staircase" as the subject of the painting, "empty staircase" is just an abstract concept, and "drops" is just a concept that is clear in the mind but difficult to paint, making it difficult for people to start. A certain student painted a painting boy, holding an inkstone to catch the dripping water, completely bringing out the theme, which is also a proper selection of materials. In short, emotion is "abstract," and we must express it "concretely." The more vividly it is expressed, the more it can move people. I once saw a work at a photography exhibition with the theme of a water carrier, with vast waves, and distinct human figures. The work was inscribed with the words "A burden of the world on one shoulder," which fully expressed the hardships of the human world, and made people linger for a long time. The poem "The Reeds" has a feeling of helplessness, which makes future generations sigh, doesn't it have the same meaning?</p>
<p>Since ancient times, lyrical poetry should be based on the Xing style; reeds and white dew are just the right representative works. The predecessors said that the Xing style is inevitably close to the mysterious; I think that taking the object that ignites emotions as the beginning of writing can also be said to be close to an objective standard.</p>
<p>You are all studying literature and art, so I will be foolishly presumptuous.</p>
<h3>Reading a History of Hungarian Literature</h3>
<p>— Yiwu</p>
<p>While casually reading a history of Hungarian literature, I became very interested in three "patriotic poets," including Petőfi.</p>
<p>In the 1850s, the Hungarian people were concerned about the danger facing their nation and suffered from the pain of autocratic oppression, which led to the emergence of patriotic poets. The most outspoken and most supported by the people was Petőfi. Arany was also as famous as him. Reading his allegorical poem "The Shackled Crane" allows one to imagine the poet's environment and the status of his nation at that time. But he was also "fortunate," as Tompa, who was as famous as him and lived in the same era, did not have the freedom to write poetry like that.</p>
<p>Tompa had to write many allegorical poems. He wrote a poem called "Beyond the Crane" in response to "The Shackled Crane." The gist of it is this: "Spring has come, and the crane has returned to its old nest; but crane, you have been deceived, because there is no spring here. Fly back to the happy sky, don't look for our grasslands, our grasslands have turned into cemeteries. Don't stand in our ponds, because the water in the ponds is mixed with human blood. Don't perch on our roof, the roof is full of burnt wood. Go back to the south, because you are happier than us, God gave you two homes, but we only have one, and even that one has been lost. Fly back, and if you meet people who escaped from here earlier, tell them that we are declining, weakening, and disintegrating day by day."</p>
<p>As for Petőfi, he rarely wrote allegorical poems. When the news of the outbreak of the revolution on March 14, 1848, reached the Hungarian capital, causing the cabinet to fall, Petőfi wrote the famous "We, Hungary," and recited it in front of a large crowd on the fifteenth. The last sentence of each chapter of this poem is "We swear, we swear never to be slaves again!" A chorus of voices responded—in today's terms, it's like shouting slogans. After Petőfi finished reciting the poem, the crowd immediately rushed to the printing press, dragged away the censor, and had the poem printed. This was the first poem published without censorship!</p>
<p>How glorious! Patriotic poets, national writers! It turns out that you don't have to rely on the power of the saber to publish your works, which, in my opinion, I always suspect is a lie of literary historians!</p>
<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Parking his rickshaw by the street and sitting on the footrest to rest, he thought of that matter again.</p>
<p>That matter had been haunting him for more than half a month. Even in his sleep at night, he often woke up in shock. "Five hundred thousand first prize," it was really a great fortune! He wanted to get rich, so he couldn't sleep well, worrying and calculating.</p>
<p>For several days, he really wanted to take a risk and spend two dollars to buy two small strips. The two dollars were what he had secretly saved from pulling rickshaws for several years, hidden in his belt, not even his own wife knew about it. Now, he wanted to use this one-of-a-kind accumulated savings to make a fortune.</p>
<p>"Five hundred thousand, really a great fortune."</p>
<p>He repeated it, but he always lacked the courage, so he still hadn't bought it these days. He understood it very clearly himself; with so many numbers, how could he possibly get lucky? His fate was no good, otherwise he wouldn't have suffered all these years. And he somewhat believed in fate, so the two dollars were kept in his belt and hadn't moved at all.</p>
<p>However, he was conflicted. He also thought: That, isn't it unavoidable to get lucky? Even if he didn't dare to hope for the first prize, the second prize, the third prize, and many small prizes, wouldn't any prize be more than two dollars? As long as he could win, that would be fine. Xiao Liu, who also pulled rickshaws, won twenty dollars last month. You can't say that rickshaw pullers can't win prizes, that they don't have good luck.</p>
<p>Just then, the clerks in a cigarette shop next to where he was parked shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"If you want to get rich, come and buy it, there are only three days left, Aviation Highway Lottery, first prize five hundred thousand, one dollar for a strip!"</p>
<p>In front of the counter, there was a crowd of people, frantically reaching into their pockets, handing over the crisp white dollars without hesitation or stinginess, and then receiving the lottery tickets. They walked away happily as if they had bought treasure. People were so busy buying, as if the fortune was about to leave in a moment. Only at this moment, buying a ticket would make you rich. He was a little flustered, he wanted to do it.</p>
<p>"Leave it to fate!"</p>
<p>Making his final decision, he stood up from the footrest and finally squeezed into the crowd. After a while, when he squeezed out again, two lottery tickets replaced his two banknotes.</p>
<p>"001785"</p>
<p>"467203"</p>
<p>He firmly remembered the numbers on the two lottery tickets. These numbers would follow him into his sleep.</p>
<p>Now that he had spent his only savings for years, in order to make a fortune, he had to put all his hope on expectation. He was looking forward to the twenty-ninth in two days. On that day, a transformation would come to his head, either "sorrow" or "joy."</p>
<p>But at this moment, he was walking with a happy mood, pulling his rickshaw.</p>
<h3>Small Notes from a Traveler's Window</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>I have written two articles to record the banning of Su Shi's works. Recently, while reading "Collected Works of Yuan Xiaoxiu," I found another important material. This is what Xiaoxiu said in the "Small Preface to Dragon Lake Remnants":</p>
<p>The writings of Zizhan's life, since the decree from Suzhou, half of them entered the Dragon Palace. The rest of his writings that were hidden in double walls for people after he wrote them by the pond could not be preserved. It was not until the Xuanhe era that a Taoist priest in a memorial pointed to him as Kui Star, and then the ban on Su Shi's writings was lifted.</p>
<p>The strictness of the ban on Su Shi's works at that time was such that it even reached this point. Later, the lifting of the ban, which was based on the Taoist priest's pointing to him as Kui Star, is particularly difficult to believe. Because the resolution of political events will never be so simple.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (74)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>The egoism in his soul had put on the mask of integrity, and all the disguised and hidden interests were fighting and struggling with each other in his soul. The initial worry gave way to clever reasoning, then reappeared, then disappeared again.</p>
<p>He turned around and sat down, searching for a motive for a decision, a strong excuse to fix his hesitation, to convince his natural honesty. He had raised this question many times: "Since I am this man's son, since I know this and have admitted to being his son, isn't it very natural for me to accept his property?" But this argument could not stop his conscience from saying to him in a low voice, "No."</p>
<p>Suddenly, he thought: "Since I am not the son of the man I used to think was my father, then I can no longer accept anything from him, whether when he is alive or after he is dead. This is neither right nor fair. This property should belong to my brother in the future."</p>
<p>This new way of looking at things made him feel a little relieved, eased his conscience a little, and he returned to the window.</p>
<p>"That's right," he thought, "I should no longer accept the inheritance from the family, I have to give it all to Bill, because I am not his father's son. That's how it should be. Then isn't it right for me to keep my father's property?"</p>
<p>Since he had admitted that he could not use Roland's property, and he had decided to give it up completely, he agreed and allowed himself to keep Maraisa's share, because if he did not accept either share, he would become destitute.</p>
<p>Now that this difficult matter had been resolved, he thought about Bill's problem at home again. How could he get him to leave home? He couldn't think of a feasible way when the whistle of a steamboat entering the dock seemed to give him an answer, suggesting an idea to him.</p>
<p>So he lay down on his bed with his clothes on and dreamed until dawn.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, he went out to see if his plan was possible. Later, after running around to several places and visiting a few people, he came to his parents' house. His mother was waiting for him in the room.</p>
<p>"If you didn't come," she said, "I wouldn't dare to go down."</p>
<p>She had just finished speaking when she heard Roland shouting on the stairs:</p>
<p>"Aren't we going to eat today, damn it!"</p>
<p>No one answered, and he grumbled angrily:</p>
<p>"Josephine, damn it! What are you doing?"</p>
<p>The maid's voice came from the basement:</p>
<p>"I'm here, sir, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Where is madam?"</p>
<p>"Madam and Mr. Zhean are upstairs."</p>
<p>So he raised his head to the upper floor and shouted:</p>
<p>"Louise?"</p>
<p>Roland's mother answered, half-opening the door:</p>
<p>"What's the matter, friend?"</p>
<p>"Aren't we going to eat, damn it!"</p>
<p>"Okay, we're coming."</p>
<p>So she came down, followed by Zhean.</p>
<p>Roland saw the young man and said loudly:</p>
<p>"Oh, you've come! Have you grown tired of your new home?"</p>
<p>"No, father, but I have something to discuss with mother this morning."</p>
<p>Zhean spread out his palms and walked forward. When he felt his hand being held affectionately by the old man, a strange and unexpected emotion made him convulse, the emotion of separation, of no hope of return, of eternal farewell.</p>

<h3>Financial Market Makes Up for Losses with Vigorous Gold Speculation, Price Recovers Two Yuan</h3>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Issues Another Gold Ban, Market Opens Weak</p>
<p>Banks Show Strong Appetite, Guang Gang Group Makes Up for Losses, Rapid Rebound</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday rebounded. In reality, it was large players aggressively covering their short positions, which was exhilarating. However, the day's market situation was quite erratic. In the morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and the United States rose, and forward silver prices on the Fifth Metals Exchange also rose by 2.4% to 3%. Exchange rates continued to contract. London spot gold fell by 2 pence, and the U.S. official gold buying price remained unchanged. Stocks rose by $2.49, U.S. cotton edged up, and U.S. wheat fell slightly. The wool market opened sharply lower at $78, and then stabilized somewhat, but struggled to break the $80 mark. After the opening, the domestic market gradually weakened. Reuters reported that Acting U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau had announced a supplement to President Roosevelt's gold ban, causing a drop. However, banks seized the opportunity to buy U.S. dollars cheaply, engaging in arbitrage between British and American exchange rates. Although a speculator named Wu sold, the price still rebounded. The market initially weakened but then strengthened, with large players such as the Guang Gang group vigorously covering their short positions. The domestic market was extremely tight, breaking through the $80 mark. After the close, the market was even more bullish, resulting in a higher closing price than the previous day. Western merchants offered a substantial supply, mainly due to rumors from National agencies that the U.S. was planning to change the gold-silver ratio to 1:16, with a decision expected tomorrow (the current ratio being 1:33). There were also rumors that leaders of the American inflation faction would join banking activities, suggesting that silver prices should rise. However, due to Western merchants and banks buying U.S. dollars and selling British pounds, exchange rates tended to decline, leading to hedging activities and a gold market that was weak but suddenly bullish. The rough gold price was $1,055. The day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $678.9, down $2.3 from the previous close. Goods opened at $8.6. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4 pence for British pounds and $34 for U.S. dollars. Heng Xing, Yi Da, Yong, and others sold forward contracts. U.S. dollars for April were difficult to sell at $1.875, falling from $9.3 to within $7. Gan Chang Xiang and Da De Cheng even sold at $5.8. It was anticipated that HSBC would post gains of 125 for both British and American currencies, which seemed insufficient. Heng Yu, Yi Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong, and others bought forward contracts at lower prices. HSBC bought U.S. dollars for April at 25, rising back to $7.4. Da De Cheng, Heng Xing, Yuan Mao, Yong, and others sold, but it was difficult for the price to rise further. After struggling, Hui Xiang came to sell, then retreated to $6. Hua Bi bought U.S. dollars for March at .875, and McCallie bought April at $1.875. Yi Yu, Yuan Mao, Yong, Shen Kang, Heng Xing, Gan Chang Xiang, and others jointly purchased, gradually pushing the price back up to $8.6. Zhao Feng Chang, Yi Da, and Yong sold at higher prices, causing a $1 drop. However, due to Yuan Da, Yong Heng Xing, Hong Li, and others still buying, the situation remained uncertain. After fluctuating, the noon close was $678.4, and goods were bid at $8.3.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $678.1, with goods opening at $8.2. The market seemed weak at the opening. U.S. dollars for April at $1.875 were once difficult to buy, quoted at $7.6. Rui Kang bought forward contracts, and Hua Bi and Zheng Jin also bought U.S. dollars for April at 1.25. Heng Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong, Yi Da, Yong, Ri Chang, and Heng Xing continuously bought forward contracts, pushing the price up to $81.10. Zhi Feng, Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, Tong Tai Chang sold, causing a drop to $79.7. Heng Xing continued to buy, resulting in a large position. Yi Da, Yong, Zhi Feng, Yong Heng Xing, Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Tai, and others worked hard to buy, raising the price again to $82.4. Da Fa, Yong Heng Yu, Yong Feng, Yi Feng Yong, and Wan Xing offered forward contracts at higher prices, causing a drop to .05. After entering, aggressive short covering continued. The foreign exchange market tightened, with U.S. dollars for April at $35 being difficult to settle. Heng Xing, Yuan Mao, Yong, Da De Cheng, Heng Tai, and others competed fiercely to buy, pushing the price up to $83.5. Shanghai sold U.S. dollars for April at .9375. Hong Li sold, retreating to $2.6, while Heng Tai, Gan Chang Xiang, and Rui Kang bought again. After struggling, the closing price was $683.2, and goods were bid at $2.9. After the close, Heng Xing repeatedly bought aggressively, eventually rising to $4.8. The highest price of the day was $683.5, and the lowest was $675.8, with a fluctuation of $7.7. As a result, the price recovered by $2 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was $33.875 for U.S. dollars posted by HSBC, up 1.25, equivalent to a gold price of $719. Based on the closing price, it was approximately $36 lower, $4 less than the previous close. The registered price for this month was $693, $687 for January, and $678 for February. The morning margin call was $693, and the afternoon margin call was $698. The rough gold price was $1,055. Trading in the market was still active. Tianjin Gang sold approximately 1,500 taels to Ying Feng Heng and others, from $1,054 to $4.5. In addition, other gangs traded 300 taels between themselves for $1,057. There were 4,368 forward contracts remaining for this month and 1,841 for January.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was initially calm, then active, with large players aggressively covering short positions. In total, Heng Xing, Sheng Da, Shen Kang, Da De Cheng, Gan Chang Xiang, Yi Feng Yong, Yi Yu, Yuan Mao, Zhao Feng Chang, Fu Yu, Fu Tai Heng, Rui Kang, Sen Chang, Yong, and others were on the buying side. Hui Xiang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Da Xing, Yong Hong Xing, Da Fa Yong, Heng Chang, Yong Chang Sheng, Yong Yuan Mao Yong, Da Chang Xiang, and Tian Feng Bing Xing were on the selling side. Heng Tai and Zhi Feng Yong went in and out, while Yong De, Yong Feng, Hong Li, and Yi Da Yong went in before going out. Dalian Gang and Shun Li jointly traded over 1,600 forward contracts, clearing over 700. Wan Xing jointly traded over 1,600 forward contracts, clearing over 600. Guang Gang Sheng Da, represented by Shen Kang, bought over 600 forward contracts. Heng Xing bought over 1,700 forward contracts and sold over 700. There were a total of 39,991 February chips.</p>

The U.S. dollar seemed firm despite unfavorable news after opening. However, banks seized the opportunity to buy cheaply. HSBC's posted rates revealed that British and American currencies only rose 125, French francs rose 6 francs, Dutch currency each rose 75, Hong Kong dollars remained unchanged, and German marks rose 1 mark. After this, the market gradually tightened. Although Jewish merchant Qiao Zhibu did not aggressively sell, the banking sector strongly bought. The closing near-term selling prices were 1 shilling 4 pence for British pounds and $33.9375 for U.S. dollars, which was 125 weaker for British pounds and 0625 tighter for U.S. dollars compared to the previous close. The banking sector had a strong appetite. Western merchants, such as the Silver Company, bought U.S. dollars and sold British pounds, resulting in a day's market situation where the British pound was weak and the U.S. dollar was tight. Chinese merchants sold approximately 400,000 yuan. Qiao Zhibu also heavily sold. Chinese merchants generally offered over 100,000 pounds sterling. The transaction record is listed below.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>December Government Bond Delivery Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>The total delivery amount at the exchange was only 8,700,050</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for December futures at the Chinese Securities Exchange, and it proceeded very smoothly. The amount was not very large. The total amount was 28,889,000. After deducting the 20,018,500 cleared by the brokers themselves, the amount delivered at the exchange was only 8,700,050. The amount delivered off-exchange could not be verified, but it was rumored to be over 10 million. Four was the number of the firm that most often took delivery. Twenty-one and thirty-two also often delivered bonds. Deliveries came more often from smaller investors. The whole process was full of drama. After the resignation of Finance Minister Song, the bond market became tumultuous. In November, there was hardly a day without storms. On December 1, the lowest price of the reduced military bonds was 51.8 yuan. Compared with the highest price of 65.5 yuan on November 1, the difference was almost 14 yuan. The highest and lowest prices of the salt tax bonds also differed by almost 10 yuan. In between, there were large fluctuations up and down, so most investors made a considerable profit, while speculators were exhausted. The news was often surprising, and those who followed blindly were often misled. After Song resigned and Kong succeeded him, there were initial political rumors, followed by rumors of reorganizing domestic and foreign debts and issuing new government bonds. The resumption of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russia and the seriousness of the situation in the Far East also affected the market. In mid-November, the Fujian Incident suddenly broke out, leading to more rumors and war clouds. Bond prices plummeted. Later, the market sentiment was greatly boosted by the neutral stance of the Southwest, and major players bought heavily, causing the market price to recover quickly. Due to the shortage of reduced military bonds, the recovery was the fastest. Currently, the war in Fujian and Zhejiang is becoming increasingly serious. It is believed that the central government will deal with Fujian alone, so there will not be many problems. The bond market may experience another surge. Therefore, trading on the exchange is also extremely active. The total number of futures transactions in December was 51,149,500 yuan. The delivery, clearing, and total transactions are listed below (in units of 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported on the 28th that the New York stock market continued to rise, as bullish investors took profits, but commercial news was very good, including the continued payment of dividends by the New York Gas Company. Bonds were stable. The total daily volume was 1.48 million shares. The cold weather in the Northwest decreased slightly, but the market was still stable due to the strength of the stocks. According to private news, the United States will have cotton loans with Argentina, which made people feel good.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Record of This Month's Marked Yarn and Cotton Delivery</p>
<p>11,250 bales of yarn, average price 170 yuan</p>
<p>15,500 dan of cotton, average price 39.5 yuan</p>
<p>The December marked yarn started on July 1, with a price of 198.1 yuan, rising slightly to 200.1 yuan. At that time, old cotton was being replaced by new cotton. The U.S. cotton market fluctuated due to the implementation of inflationary policies. Then, sales in the autumn were disappointing, and banditry in Sichuan and Jiangxi was rampant, delaying real demand. As a result, Shanghai's inventory increased daily. There were over 30,000 bales of yarn in warehouses. At the same time, Japanese merchants were dumping in all directions, further impacting Chinese yarn. Although the factories tried to maintain the price, sales decreased overall. Some holders had no way out and had to dump on the futures market. As a result, the southern market gradually declined, breaking the 180 yuan mark. Then, on October 16, the Cotton Industry Control Council was established, which initially stabilized yarn prices and started [to address] yarn inventories [in] yarn and fabric [companies]. The market price was temporarily stabilized, rising slightly to 189 yuan. Unexpectedly, the situation in Zhejiang changed abruptly, and the yarn market suddenly changed with the situation. A bull in a certain factory had no intention of taking delivery and would exceed [a certain amount]. Rumors in the market spread that the Control Council also abandoned its plan to take delivery. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, the market crashed like a broken bamboo. The price fell by 6-7 yuan in one day, a situation rare in the past. The market was as chaotic as hemp. The exchange increased the special margin for sellers, reaching a maximum of 60 yuan. The number of times the margin was increased was unprecedented. However, the facts were as such, and the trend was unstoppable. As a result, there was no proper solution. By the beginning of this month, the market atmosphere was the worst since the exchange was established. As sellers were preparing to deliver actual goods, buyers were hesitant due to the worsening environment. Therefore, the lowest price fell below the 70 yuan mark, discovering a new low since the Republic of China. Then, the exchange's shareholders, seeing the bad situation, organized a bull company to buy some of the marked yarn at 170 yuan and prepared to sacrifice and sell it cheaply outside to quickly get rid of this stock from the exchange. As a result, the market temporarily stabilized. On the last day, four rounds were auctioned, all at 170 yuan. In the end, 11,250 bales remained, and the delivery price was averaged at 170 yuan over three days, totaling 1,912,500 yuan. It was heard that the buyers were all bull companies: Yu Da 6,550 bales, Rui Da 1,500 bales, and Yuan Da 1,050 bales. The deliveries were all scattered, with products such as 20-count Ren, Zhong, Long Chuan, and Cai Hua yarn. The broker numbers and brand quantities of the receiving and delivering parties are listed below for reference.</p>

<p>The December Zheng marked cotton started on July 1, with a price of 45.6 yuan. At that time, it was the era of old cotton. The inventory was decreasing daily, which was inversely proportional to yarn. In July and August, the cry for short squeezes was loud. Distant new cotton was also affected, so the cotton price was higher than the yarn price. Later, the news came that our Finance Minister Song Ziwen had signed a loan agreement in the United States to purchase cotton and wheat on credit, causing a shock in the market and a small drop. However, buyers continued to hold tight. Then, on August 8, the U.S. cotton government estimated a bumper harvest, and the price became unstable. At the same time, the price of rice in our country was low, and the new cotton fields increased by one-third, and the rainfall was balanced, so the cotton production looked good. The market price gradually declined, reaching a minimum of 39 yuan. Then, when the new cotton was released, there were claims that the moisture content was too high and the delivery standards were substandard, and the market price rose again to 41.5-6 yuan. By the middle of this month, the effort to maintain the yarn price failed, and the yarn price reached a new low. Factory purchases were sluggish, and factories had no appetite to buy, so the price fell into the customs again, reaching a minimum of 38.4 yuan. However, the Ningbo gang and a manufacturer firmly intended to take delivery, and scattered shorts covered, and the price rose again to 39.9 yuan. In the end, 15,500 dan remained, and the delivery price was averaged at 39.5 yuan over three days. The Ningbo merchants took delivery exclusively. The delivering parties were scattered individual holders. The products were Fire Engine Cotton and Tongzhou Cotton. The broker numbers and brand quantities of the receiving and delivering parties are listed below for reference.</p>

<h3>Spot Yarn and Cotton Consumption is Sluggish</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained unchanged, but sales in all directions were quite sluggish. Due to the year-end settlement, the customer gangs stopped, and the customs also closed for three days, making trading even more sluggish. Standard yarn stopped bidding due to the month-end delivery. Only the mainland gangs entered 196 bales, and the Guangdong gangs entered 26 bales. The market situation was similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>The cotton market was still stable. As the overseas cotton market stabilized, the Japanese factory's intention to enter the spot cotton market moved again. The sources were 734 bales of Tong cotton and 659 bales of Yao cotton. The spot cotton prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 44.5 (Japanese) Shanghai Factory entered 665 pieces Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 43.50</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 44.50 Dacheng Factory entered 194 pieces Spot delivery to warehouse</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 45.00 Shanghai Factory entered 300 pieces Spot delivery to factory</p>
<h3>The Auction of Marked Cotton for May and June Will Continue Next Year as Usual</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cotton Exchange has been arguing about the standard of yarn and cotton for a long time. According to market rumors, both yarn and cotton were to be changed. Today at 3 p.m., a meeting of brokers was convened at the exchange's main market to discuss everything. As a result, it was decided that the auction of marked cotton for the May and June terms will start on January 4, 1934, and the standard will remain the same. Everyone unanimously agreed. However, the reform of the cotton yarn standard has not been determined, so the auction will be temporarily suspended until a solution is found.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Buyers Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially saw active buying due to strong performance on Wall Street, resulting in a firm and lively market. However, it later retreated as long positions were closed out. Ultimately, spot prices rose by 5 points, while futures rose by 2 to 4 points.</p>
<p>Market quotations: English cotton rose by 5 points, futures by 4 to 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 23 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to unfavorable news from the India-Japan conference, but later strengthened slightly as short positions were covered. Consequently, Pungole fell by half a rupee, Omra fell by two and a half annas, while White Raw Silk remained unchanged. (Telegraph from the 28th)</p>

<h3>River Rice Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Only thirty or forty boats arrived from various supplier groups (over five thousand piculs). Among them, the late rice market, although supplies arrived daily, was also scarce. However, due to limited outward channels, stockpiles in the port gradually increased. Moreover, with the Gregorian New Year approaching, there is unlikely to be a large demand. Therefore, its trend lacks the possibility of a turnaround. Observing that sellers show no eagerness to sell off quickly, there will be no sharp downward trend either. This year, only a flat market is expected. Although spot transactions still fluctuate, there are only about six hundred bags in the hands of wholesale merchants and warehouses combined. Consequently, prices remain unaffected. However, special channels have emerged for medium-grade rice recently, with slightly better quality. Merchants have managed to sell off newly arrived stock, leading to a stable market. Short-grain rice is scarce, and good-quality rice is up a few cents. Yin Yuan rice is also slightly tight.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over seventy boats arrived from various places along the river. Due to overcast and rainy weather, few buyers visited the market, resulting in slow sales. Prices for various types of rice, including white japonica, white yuan, yin yuan, early rice, thin rice, Yang Du, and Ke Hsien, remain stable.</p>
<h3>Ke Hsien Rice Prices Fluctuate Slightly, Sales Slow</h3>
<p>Local Stockpilers Show Interest</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Hsien rice market continued its downward trend from the previous day's weakness. Stockpiles are abundant, sales are sluggish, and market confidence is hard to boost. Yesterday, the price of various types of rice continued to fall by five or six cents, up to nearly ten cents. Following the small price decrease, local merchants began to inquire. Local stockpilers believe that current prices have reached the bottom and there is a need to clear out stock. Holding until the situation stabilizes will likely lead to large sales. Therefore, their mindset has become active. They will likely absorb stock from the market soon. Currently, they are focusing on river rice and factory rice. It is reported that they have already stockpiled tens of thousands of bags. The market can only turn around after local stockpilers inquire about Ke Hsien rice. Yesterday, local merchants and stockpilers completed transactions for 590 bags of Hunan machine oil rice at prices ranging from 7.25 to 7.20 yuan, and 250 bags of machine red rice at prices ranging from 6.85 to 6.80 yuan. Ningbo merchants also took 300 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice at prices ranging from 7.15 to 7.08 yuan. Quanzhou also took 50 bags of Wuhu machine yuan rice at 7.60 yuan, and 180 bags of Wuxi machine yuan rice at 8.18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Prices Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, lower-grade soybeans continued to rise by three to four cents. Although middle and upper grades were stable, the trend was leaning downward by two cents. Local oil mills and bean curd workshops inquired about purchases and completed transactions for about thirteen to fourteen cartloads. Market sentiment has stabilized slightly. Currently, due to a shortage of railway cars, supplies arriving by train are scarce. As a result, stocks are accumulating in Bengbu and prices are becoming slightly tighter. Supplies arriving by boat are relatively consistent, so the market for Guide soybeans and Dangshan soybeans is still relatively soft.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Both White and Light Brown Sugar Show Signs of Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened due to the rise in the Dutch exchange rate and a slight decrease in customs gold. The public association's listed price for 24 coarse granulated white common sugar was 19.40 yuan, down another ten cents from the previous day. Eight/Nine Dutch Red SR mark was listed at 15.75 yuan. The offer for Taikoo sugar was 20.15 yuan, but no transactions were made. Zhenji No. 1 cotton white fell another five cents to 18.50 yuan. Prices for Nos. 2, 3, and 4 remained unchanged. Chaoqing sugar showed little change. A few hundred bags opened yesterday at prices ranging from 12.70 to 12.30 yuan. Jianbang brokers stated that new Diaqing sugar arriving today could be sold at 12.40 yuan, down two cents from the previous listing. The trend still shows signs of weakening.</p>
<p>Dried and Preserved Goods</p>
<h3>Shantou Preserved Tangerines Temporarily Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Recently, very few Shantou preserved tangerines have arrived, and existing stock is also low. It was reported yesterday that shipments have resumed, but they are temporarily out of stock. The previous listing was 30.50 yuan, and future prices may rise.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Foreign Silk Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>New York silk inventories not weak. Since the beginning of winter, imports of Japanese silk into New York have not weakened. According to news from various French firms, New York's silk inventories remain high. Before Christmas, New York City had a total inventory of 70,000 to 80,000 bales of raw silk from China, Japan, Italy, and France. Japanese silk accounted for nearly 70,000 bales, Chinese silk 3,700 to 3,800 bales, and Italian and French silk over 4,000 bales.</p>
<p>Silk waste exports decline. Exports of Chinese silk waste (i.e., silk noil) are declining. In the most recent ten-day period, only 253 dan were declared for export from Shanghai, with no shipments to the Americas. Only 85 dan were shipped to Lyon and Marseille.</p>
<p>Artificial silk sales stagnate as the year-end approaches. As the year-end approaches, credit is extremely tight and sales of artificial silk have completely stagnated. Yesterday, only various ribbon factories on this street had small-volume transactions. The market is quiet. However, the existing stock in the hands of various wholesale merchants is currently being shipped out in batches, making transportation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway quite busy.</p>
<p>European and American silk sales remain lifeless. The New York raw silk market has been sluggish recently due to the approaching year-end, making it difficult for prices to hold firm. The sudden rise and fall of Yokohama's Japanese silk prices is purely manipulation by speculators. Real sales in Europe and America are unlikely to turn around. Shanghai's Chinese and foreign silk merchants remain passive, showing no signs of life. Sales of silk fabrics have also stagnated due to the year-end. There is no relevant silk transaction, with nothing noteworthy in the market.</p>

<h3>Stopgap Policy</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>In the current world, which is full of contradictions, there are many unnecessary things that people know "this road will not work," but they still exist and are carried out. Unemployment relief is one example.</p>
<p>Logically, since heaven has endowed people with two hands, two feet, and a brain, then except for those who do not want to live, everyone has the right to use these tools to obtain the material things they need to survive. No one can deprive anyone else, and there is no reason to deprive them. With the world's capacity, how can "work" be lost? And why is there a need for relief! However, now "unemployment" has become a widespread phenomenon, and "relief" has become an important issue in the domestic policies of various countries.</p>
<p>That "work" leads to "loss" shows that human effort is not fully exerted. But is the lack of human effort due to a surplus in material life, such that labor is no longer needed? The answer is no. The cries of hunger and cold are filling the earth, and even the supposedly wealthiest United States cannot avoid it. It's just that bankers have surplus money in their vaults, and big merchants have surplus goods in their warehouses! Money is hidden on Wall Street, wheat is dumped into the sea, cotton fields are restricted, machines are gathering dust, and the entire society shouts "economic recession"! In this way, we can understand how thirty million people worldwide have lost their jobs!</p>
<p>Once, the Russian novelist Pilnyak traveled to the United States and saw that large factories were closed, machines were gathering dust, goods in warehouses were being gnawed and rotted by rats, and yet there were tens of thousands of gaunt and miserable unemployed workers wandering the streets. He considered it a miracle. Indeed, to someone who has come from another world, this is truly a miracle.</p>
<p>Losing a job certainly entails losing the guarantee of survival. But survival is the last thing every living being wants to maintain. Even chickens and dogs can muster their last strike before death, let alone humans? "Desperation leads to risky behavior," "extremes breed reversals." Smart economists will think of these things. So they have to take out a portion of their profits to serve as relief money, buying a "temporary maintenance of the status quo." At the same time, they can show that this comes from their own "grace," and receive the reputation of "charity" or "generosity," suppressing the crisis. But can doing this patch over this deep-seated unemployment panic, so that the world will be "peaceful and uneventful" from then on? This is something our capitalists don't think about. If they did think about it, they wouldn't be so foolish as to take out thousands upon thousands of dollars every year to do extremely boring relief work, in order to prolong their existence for a short time. Instead, there should be a further step. "The one who tied the bell must untie it." Return work to everyone. But this is not compatible with modern society.</p>
<h3>One Aspect of Eastern Civilization – Women's Foot Binding</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that foreigners in rural villages around Zhangjiakou took photos of old-fashioned Chinese women with bound feet for malicious propaganda. The government believes this "concerns the national image" and has issued orders throughout the country to strictly prohibit it. Of course, we feel gratified about this matter. Because taking our esteemed country's "three-inch golden lotuses" to be displayed in foreign museums of ethnology for viewing naturally carries a strong sense of insult. Failure to prohibit it would inevitably "concern the national image."</p>
<p>However, Chinese women's foot binding is a product of women being bound by old ethics and teachings. If we want to avoid foreigners displaying them in museums as antiques to be played with, thereby damaging the national image, it seems we should put some effort into the natural foot movement and breaking down the old ethics and teachings. If we want "family scandals" not to be publicized, we should start with eliminating "bad reputations and misdeeds" at the root. The emergence of China's "three-inch golden lotuses" was not like the current "modern" men and women who adopt "Westernization," wearing high-heeled shoes and perming their hair for fashion. Rather, it was like the current trend of society becoming increasingly decadent and dissolute, where women must use their powdered legs and exposed breasts as trademarks to conduct "wholesale and retail auctions," driven by the times and forced by the environment, leading to a temporary craze. Of course, the "golden lotus" had already "swept" the general public, and the adulation of foot-obsessed poets and writers played a significant role in promoting it. Expressions such as "graceful lotus steps" and "elegant and slender" were truly depicted vividly and thoroughly, expressing the desire for all the "talented scholars of the empire" to prostrate themselves at the feet of the "golden lotus." In reality, the main reason was the "men rule the outside, women rule the inside" doctrine. Under the confinement of "inner words do not go out, outer words do not come in" and "locked in deep boudoirs," the feet of some young ladies, famous women, wives, and grandmothers were not used, and naturally became useless. At the same time, because men possessively wanted to keep women chaste and avoid "illicit affairs," binding feet small was a good method. In this sense, "three-inch golden lotuses" did have historical significance in China, and at least made a great contribution to maintaining social customs. If it is said that China still has culture, still has spirits and morals worth preserving, then women's foot binding, which played a significant moral role in the relationship between husband and wife, one of the "five cardinal relationships," although not daring to be ranked alongside "national studies" and "national heritage," is at least one of the national essences!</p>
<p>The worst thing was that foreign battleships and cannons broke through our "closed-door policy," and Western "material civilization" followed, impacting our "land of propriety and righteousness." In social circles, our secluded, virtuous, and tranquil women were required to wear high heels to dance "waltzes" in dance halls and stroll in parks, chatting intimately. Women who did not qualify for the social scene with bound feet were also required to run several miles at six in the morning to work, in order to revitalize industry. Naturally, women with lotus steps were "unable to cope." Therefore, our literary giants and poets, using their exquisite writing skills to describe the "three-inch golden lotuses," which had been the subject of endless praise, had to decline, transforming from a "virtue" into a "bad habit."</p>
<p>Now that the evil custom of women's foot binding is known to all who possess a little new knowledge and are still "modern," especially among young students, who, when they occasionally mention it, inevitably turn up their noses and vomit it out, expressing an unspeakable feeling of hatred and disgust, it can be seen that the natural foot movement seems to have had considerable effect. However, judging from the facts, this is not necessarily so. Many people who cling to "national heritage" and "national essence," and those gentlemen concerned about social customs, seeing the prevalence of dissolute customs, have thus promoted maintaining old morals, respecting Confucianism, and reading the Classic of Filial Piety and Biographies of Women. Some even take the morally rich "Eastern civilization" to resist the purely materialistic "Western civilization." Such a performance is not as straightforward as advocating women's foot binding, praising the "three-inch golden lotus," and wishing that all the talented scholars of the empire would prostrate themselves at the feet of the "golden lotus."</p>
<p>Westerners have a wonderful analogy, saying that if you want to understand the degree of civilization in a country, you can look at the amount of rouge, face powder, and perfume used by women. If you really think that China still has an Eastern civilization to preserve, and still has spirits and morals worth praising, then using this example, we should advise those "Eastern civilization" advocates who hate the world and are jealous of society not to fuss about burying themselves in books to "sort things out." Just conduct a statistical survey on whether the "golden lotuses" are three inches, and whether the "bow shoes" fit "a handful," and you can see the current state of "Eastern civilization."</p>
<p>Not long ago, a European, seeing that Western Christianity was tainted by "material desires" and had lost its original doctrines, did not hesitate to travel across the ocean to China to convert to Buddhism. Buddhism emphasizes purity, inaction, and values spiritual morality, which is also the marrow of "Eastern civilization." This time, the foreigners' taking photos of bound feet in Zhangjiakou may have been with the intention of worshiping the "three-inch golden lotus" of "Eastern civilization"? If my words are correct, not only is there no need to ban it, but the friends of "Eastern civilization" should hold a grand welcome party with "convenience"!</p>
<h3>Concerning Women</h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Recently, two friends—Bi is busy getting engaged, Peng is busy pursuing, and when a few people get together, they only talk about women. In these awkward times, it seems that someone has concluded: anyone who talks about love and women</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>is an incompetent good-for-nothing, or at least a declining petty bourgeois. However, we are indeed some "dirt poor" guys, especially Peng; if he doesn't bury himself in doing things he doesn't want to do every day, he may starve at any time.</p>
<p>Originally, we also liked to talk about national affairs, but the times are already "favorable," and it is said that national affairs no longer need us youngsters to yap about. Moreover, for the sake of self-preservation, we are also afraid that the guys next door will hear us and take the opportunity to report us, and we will be arrested. If we are seriously prosecuted, other things don't matter, but the fact that we haven't yet warmed up to the dream of a woman is the most regrettable thing. Bi is most afraid of this, because he has experienced this kind of terror. Even if he is lightly sentenced to three or five years in prison, it is not worth it.</p>
<p>What about talking about the most fashionable "domestic products" or "general construction"? We feel that these things have too little connection with us, and talking about them might not sound very good.</p>
<p>What about talking about romance? We are all some "vulgar and unrefined" crude guys. Forcing ourselves to say a few words would inevitably be a laughingstock, and it would be too disappointing.</p>
<p>So we decided to talk about women. Whenever a few people meet, they only talk about women.</p>
<p>According to the principles of human nature for thousands of years, women are not impossible to talk about. To put it more forcefully, the need for women is almost as urgent as eating, and talking about them is much more stable. Even if we satirize and insult our female compatriots like the French novelist Gauthier, it would only provoke a protest from a certain female writer. As for when we talk about it, no one even bothers to pay attention, isn't that the best way to escape punishment and vent our minds!</p>
<p>The woman Bi found is said to be beautiful in many ways, but there is a large black mole somewhere, which is a flaw, a bit of a "disfigurement" regret. But Bi is madly in love with her and is already engaged. He is afraid that others will notice his lover's black mole, so he tells everyone, "I just love that black mole. When I kiss her, I must first kiss that black mole passionately." Although this philosophy is quite mysterious, it is indeed uniquely meaningful and worth savoring. The female general Peng is pursuing, although her appearance is not bad, we all think her face is too wide and her manner is too martial. But Peng says he loves her wide face and martial manner, almost treating her like an angel, eagerly pursuing her. When it comes to my own sweetheart, I think she is really lovely and really beautiful. If I don't have her, I would rather be single for life. But others tell me to my face that she is not beautiful and not particularly lovely.</p>
<p>In fact, to be fair and objective, each person's woman is only so beautiful and so lovely; however, everyone is very enthusiastic about them, no, very passionately in love with them. In the meantime, compiled into a philosophy, it is: "Any woman one finds for oneself, even if she is not beautiful, she becomes beautiful; even if she is not lovely, she becomes lovely." That is, there is an old saying: "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," which is indeed true.</p>
<p>Conversely, anything that is passively put together, such as marrying a yellow-faced sister from the countryside, then even if she is beautiful and lovely, she will inevitably become unbeautiful and unlovable, and one will inevitably want to get rid of her. This is the case with several of my brothers, except for one southern friend, who is so honest and immersed in the university of beauties, but always praises his wife who stayed in his hometown to us. This point truly makes us worship him wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Finally, although the talk is not very serious, it is the true meaning of love between men and women.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of University Students</h3>
<p>— Dai Dao</p>
<p>Because of the darkness and chaos of society, university students have no way out. Because university students have no way out, there are quite a few people who discuss the crisis of university students. The most effective are the following two views.</p>
<p>The first is that we have now reached the era of the decline of the intellectual class. Although university students are well-versed in both Chinese and Western knowledge and are very adaptable to trends, their social foundation has collapsed, and simply wearing a square hat is no longer enough to exert their authority. Moreover, old consciousness is still so strong, and they cannot get rid of the habits of the literati of the previous era. In fact, literati today are even worse than literati. Look: in this boiling capitalist society of Shanghai, some small vendors, using their skills, earn three to five yuan a day. As for barbers and tea room waiters, their lives are truly comfortable and prosperous. A university graduate must be able to run, jump, flatter, and boast to find a small position—a clerk in a government office or a teacher in a primary or secondary school—to earn a high salary of thirty yuan a month, and even then, they must rely on peaceful times to avoid "budget cuts" and "discounts." This, of course, is like swallowing bitter medicine. Even if you wear a bachelor's cap and have a belly full of formulas, philosophies, science, art, society will not pay much attention to you. Even if your status is as high as heaven and earth, society will not respect you. The era has designated university students of the intellectual class to embark on the path to death, and there is no way out.</p>
<p>The second is that although university students have high reputations and beautiful appearances, they are mostly "gold and jade on the outside, but rotten cotton on the inside" friends, lacking practical skills. Those who study mathematics and science don't understand Chinese, and can't even write a simple letter. Those who study literature even say that they failed Chinese, and can't even solve a simple algebraic problem with one equation. In short, they only know a little bit about everything. When they are in school, they don't work hard and have no foundation at all. When they leave school, they are so arrogant and think they can do everything. When they actually do it, they realize it's not easy to handle, and they don't humbly seek advice, but insist on doing things their own way. As a result, government offices are afraid of university students and want to keep them away. From then on, university students complain about injustice, but in reality, what injustice is there? It's a nail they should bump against. The university students' own lack of soundness is the fatal wound of all crises.</p>
<p>These two views have their own reasons. Of course, we all quite acknowledge the decline of the intellectual class and the poverty of university students themselves. But this is not yet the core of the crisis of university students, nor is it the only reason why university students today have no way out and only have hidden reefs. So what is the crisis of university students? In short, it is "rising desires." Let's see what the general situation is regarding the current university students' understanding of and demands on life.</p>
<p>No matter how poor they are, even to the point of being worried about tuition fees, their appearance and clothing must be so exquisite, and few can clearly recognize that this has little to do with studying. When it comes to food, they are so picky. The food in the school cafeteria seems to be poisonous, and they must wash their bags and go to restaurants to eat heartily. I have seen many university students who do not go to small restaurants. Even if they only have a few cents left for transportation, they must go to a Western restaurant to feel at ease. As for housing, the school dormitories are too crowded, so it's best to rent their own place outside the school. They would rather travel far every day, saying it's more comfortable to live there. We know that desires are bottomless. They are "already high and still rising," climbing upwards every day. From the first year of university to the fourth year, it is clear that there is a big difference. No one is willing to look back and see how the unfortunate friends following behind are starving and freezing.</p>
<p>When they are in school, desires are already so high, so when they graduate and look for a job, their standards are naturally even higher. They don't do things that are too mechanical and uncomfortable, they don't do things that pay too little, and they don't do things that don't have a good reputation. But their demands on life are getting higher and higher. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation must be comfortable and satisfactory. If their pockets are empty, they might as well borrow from others. Even though third-class trains are so empty, they don't bother to squeeze in and lose their status. It's only comfortable to sit in the first-class car with their legs crossed and their heads tilted.</p>
<p>These things are certainly reflected by the capitalist university education in the evil society of the moment, which bred them. But I think university students should not be comparable to ordinary people. Since they have profound knowledge, they must have a correct understanding. How can they go along with the crowd, becoming a social parrot, instead of transforming society and creating an environment? This is truly the crisis of university students! If university students want a way out, half of it must rely on the entire society turning over, but half of it must also rely on quickly reflecting on themselves, recognizing their own crisis, cleansing their own weaknesses, and standing at the forefront of the era to work hard. I think there is a way out, definitely not as dark as it is now.</p>
<h3>Rigid Fly</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>On a Saturday evening, I was quietly writing a letter at my desk alone, when suddenly I don't know how a little insect fell on my pen and stopped there, shaking it but it didn't move, driving it away but it didn't respond. I picked up the pen to take a look, and it turned out to be my beloved, long-lost sesame fly. Ah, long time no see, General Fly, how did you become so haggard? Where are your bright wings of the past? Where is your magnificent buzzing song of the past? Where is your happy and lively appearance of the past? Ah, how did you become so thin! How did you become so stiff!</p>
<p>Although the sesame fly was lying stiffly, its beak was still moving non-stop, sucking the ink on the tip of the pen. General Fly, suck as much as you want. Although I am poor, I won't be stingy with this ink. If the ink is not to your liking, then I still have leftover peanut candy by the bed and a full jar of Western honey in the drawer. If these can restore your former health, I will definitely not be stingy.</p>
<p>So I sent our half-stiff fly general to the candy jar and then to the honey jar. The fly general desperately sucked and desperately licked, and the movement of the beak became more rapid. The fly general, who was about to die, seemed to have a "resurrection" phenomenon. I was very happy, and I secretly prayed and blessed our fly general.</p>
<p>The fly general seemed to be full, but it still reluctantly refused to abandon the sweet pottery jar. General Fly, what's on your mind? Could it be that you are thinking of your wife, Miss Mosquito?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, you can just fly to pick up Mrs. Mosquito. If honey juice and peanut candy can't satisfy Mrs. Mosquito, then my whole body is still full of blood that hasn't been sucked for a long time. If mine isn't enough, there are more from my younger brothers, younger sisters, older sisters, and older brothers. You can just go and pick them up.</p>
<p>Ah, why don't you move? Don't misunderstand my meaning, I don't have any malicious intent of revenge. Although I suffered from cholera in the summer because I drank your poisonous saliva and almost died, and although your wife, Mrs. Mosquito, spread Malaria bacteria on my body two months ago, causing me to have a fever, I will definitely not argue with General and Mrs. Mosquito about these things. I deeply understand our position, our sweat, our blood should be provided for them to suck, this is our duty!</p>
<p>Um, General Fly, why are you always silent and motionless? Could it be that your companions and Mrs. Mosquito have all died? Are you sad? Ah, then I have no way. We have plenty of blood and sweat that can be provided for you to suck, but there is no way in the world to cure your lovesickness. Probably your doomsday has arrived. Doomsday, how can we use our blood and sweat to save you?</p>
<p>Sure enough, that "last remaining" fly general soon died in the honey jar, and I sighed for it for a while.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a copy of Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front spread out on the table, and a few words suddenly jumped into my eyes:</p>
<p>"...man himself is also a beast insect, but he will spread a little politeness on it like butter on bread."</p>
<p>So I was at a loss. I fear that our doomsday is not far away either.</p>

<h3>I Have Three Parts Like Colman</h3>
<p>— Ping Ren</p>
<p>The lights in the theater are still on, and the romance film on the silver screen has not yet been shown; but the faces of the young masters and misses who have come to see the so-called love saint Colman are already slightly flushed, as if they have had a bit of wine. This is the elusive magic power of the five words "love saint Colman".</p>
<p>"If I were Colman, all the women in the theater would love me..." I thought comically. Maybe all the young masters in the theater are thinking the same way? I don't need to hit my own head!</p>
<p>"If all the men in the theater were as lovely as Colman and completely in love with me..." I thought all the misses in the theater were thinking that way to themselves—at least, the beautiful miss sitting on my right shoulder, looking at the expression on her slightly flushed face, looking at the inner emotions expressed on the tips of her eyebrows, I thought she was thinking that way to herself.</p>
<p>I don't know what exactly caused it, but I actually smiled at her.</p>
<p>"You smile really like Colman; really, you watch Colman's movies too much, so you are influenced by him!" Mr. Wang, who came to the movie with me, said jokingly, and the beautiful miss actually smiled at my face.</p>
<p>She was saying to her companion, "There's really a bit of Colman's flavor!"</p>
<p>What? Does a person's demeanor become a kind of flavor in her mouth? "Is Colman sweet or sour?" I said to myself, just to scold people "humorously", saying that I wanted to seduce her is really wronging me.</p>
<p>But I ended up seducing her; she laughed out a soft "gezhi...gezhi" sound, and said to her companion, "He himself doesn't know whether his own flavor is fragrant or stinky!" causing the young woman to laugh loudly.</p>
<p>I was feeling very uncomfortable when the young woman said again: "It's as if we've met him somewhere?"</p>
<p>Damn it! Who has ever met you,—but maybe everyone often watches movies and is familiar with each other's faces, right?</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang, he is very smart: "Yes, it was the last movie, when we were also sitting together," he actually said randomly.</p>
<p>"No! It was two months ago when we met at the Great Light Theater watching Norma Shearer's movie; he even picked up a handkerchief for her, and later she often said that you have three parts like Colman..." the young woman lowered her head and laughed.</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" she said casually and laughed again.</p>
<p>Oh! This made me remember that day she asked me if Norma Shearer's eyes were good-looking or not after watching the movie, and I was confused by the surprised emotions, and I didn't answer her but only smiled at her—but I don't know if this smile has three parts like Colman?</p>
<p>"We are very familiar with each other..." I started to say to her, "The two ladies won't mind, right? Let's talk."</p>
<p>"Then, do you think Norma Shearer's eyes are good-looking or not?"</p>
<p>"Hmm—very good-looking, but your eyes are more beautiful and more lively?"</p>
<p>The young woman laughed loudly again, it was simply terrible; she followed with a slight laugh—this goes without saying, was charming.</p>
<p>"Then, do you think Colman is sweet or sour?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer, and the young woman actually leaned over and said in my ear: "You let her taste the flavor, is it fragrant or stinky, and at the same time, you can also taste whether her flavor is sour or sweet?" followed by another laugh, again loudly, causing the guests in the front row to turn their heads.</p>
<p>Ah! This, is too absurd! I thought.</p>
<p>"Don't be prostitutes, right?" Mr. Wang said again, nervously biting my ear.</p>
<p>"Originally, there was a little bit of me like Colman, you are really messing around!"</p>
<p>"No, there are really three parts like him, especially when he smiles." She showed even more closeness to me.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm very unhappy..."</p>
<p>Saying this, the lights in the theater went out, and the newsreel began to be shown on the silver screen; and her elbow was bumping into my arm again and again, and I hurriedly switched seats with Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>She laughed loudly from her nose, which made my mind tremble.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (31)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>(44) Trailing a Tail</p>
<p>This March, congratulations on my appointment as editor of the "Gong Hua" supplement to the Shanghai Gazette. The meaning of "Gong Hua" was to say some rigid and unyielding words, and initially, it caught a few people to operate on; however, an unfortunate event occurred in the newspaper office. For the sake of the boss's future and one's own rice bowl, it was no longer possible to continue the decapitation work. So, learning a fashionable term, "transformation," "National affairs? Who cares!" "Don't talk about national affairs, just talk about romance," it was at this time that I was accused of touching a woman's behind. In fact, I have absolutely no idea whether a woman's behind is round or square. Although in the Shanghai summer, with the gentle breeze blowing, under the chiffon cheongsam as thin as cicada wings, one can "get a glimpse," ultimately, because "the body is confined within the clothes," one cannot "see the whole picture."</p>
<p>"Shanghai"—originally named Spring in Shanghai—was also being written down bit by bit at this time, preparing to continue the unfinished "Poetry Outline." However, the fate of the poor is ultimately unkind. "Shanghai" was not finished because I was dismissed due to the chaotic period in the newspaper office. However, these written-down "scabby-headed sons" always hoped to be turned into some money. So, I tell the truth, I don't hide anything. Writing articles is simply for the sake of a few coins; the quality of the work is up to oneself but not really cared about. However, my ideal is to write a certain character into a certain type, and this bit of freedom is still held under this broken pen. As for ideology and the way out, etc., I can't manage that much. Perhaps I will ask my friend (borrowing the name) Mr. Ling He for advice on this and then try to cheat a few more coins.</p>
<p>"Shanghai" is finished. For the first half, I slightly revised the old drafts. The second half was scribbled down daily in the broadcasting studio. Furthermore, because the end of the year was approaching, it was hastily concluded. There were countless loopholes and flaws (the issue of technique is simply out of the question). I hope that friends who want to grab people for surgery will be lenient in their writing. "Shanghai" is finished. Apart from the fact that I leave one copy of this publication for myself every day, "Shanghai" has severed relations with me. Therefore, trailing a tail is for the sake of a letter.</p>
<p>When that letter arrived, Miss Xu Huiquin was playing the role of a "city girl." Fortunately, all the way down, Miss Xu did not become a character that caused people to raise eyebrows. The person who worries about Miss Xu (her husband?) can rest assured. However, I want to say something foolish: If you read a novel and worry about the characters in the novel, that's too much trouble. So, I became smart and thought that the three words "Xu Huiquin" must have caused the problem. However, foolish words are ultimately foolish words. Isn't Xu Bingnan precisely Miss Xu's respected father? Taking a step back, there wouldn't be such a coincidence with the secluded villa outside the world in Xujiahui.</p>
<p>I can't recall a novel I read where, because someone was seeking hidden meanings, the author humorously declared that one shouldn't assume that the "someone" refers to oneself just because someone in the book is written as too despicable; if you think that way, you have already acknowledged yourself as a despicable person. I will use these few words to end my tail. Finished, Shanghai, finished, tail. December 27th, at the New Sound Broadcasting Studio.</p>
