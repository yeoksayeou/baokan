<p>取消邀請美俄維持去臘五國草議案</p>
<p>置我國要求修正點於不顧殊感失望</p>
<p>（南京）我代表團十九日電京報告十九國委員會十八日開會情形、日方對邀請美俄兩國參加及明白否認僞組織兩點、仍極力反對、十八日會議中曾表示、對邀請美俄兩國參加一節、可以取消、但希望日本對其餘各條完全接受、當經决定予日以最後考慮之機會、定二十日繼續開會、如日方不同意、即將調解失敗經過報告大會、（十九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）衆覺對日提議取銷邀請美俄一舉、未必可挽回時局、蓋無論如何、調解已歸失敗也、不過現作一種姿勢、予日本以避免决裂之種種機會耳、華人方面對於昨日之會務、視爲使人失望、旣無以　滿中國之要求、亦無以堅强其議案、對於日本行爲、無一字之貶詞、對於［滿洲國］無顯明之拒絕承認、雖此係最後决議、然並未表示如日本續有新提議、將不予以容納也、獨立觀察家對於昨日會議、淡然視之、以爲其結果直對日作一大讓步耳、不邀請非會員國參加調解之建議、已屬日本勝利、故時局不必過抱悲觀、因談判之門、猶未閉、以上爲與國聨有關各方面對於目前事態之觀念、局勢混亂、已可槪見（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日經十九國委員會三小時會議、美俄之不復被邀參加解决滿洲問題、在實際上已可認爲確定無疑、據聞今日會議時、始終未曾提及美俄等國名、常稱爲非會員國、此亦可注意者、又聞删除邀請美俄之提議、原係主席希孟與秘書長德魯蒙提出、而得其他數國之贊助、至英外相西門對於此事之主張、則英代表團發言人聲稱、渠尙未便發表、惟此間有若干外交家聲稱、即令邀請美俄、而兩國究能接受與否、亦殊疑問、所以倘若邀請後、將致日本處於負破壞調解責任之地位者、反不如决定不邀之爲愈、</p>
<p>日代表松岡聲稱、倘此次解决滿案之重行努力又告失敗、委員會似將建設採用盟約第十五欵第四節、但目下渠新奉訓令、　關於進行第十五條第三節、倘有援用第四節之動議、勢須再向政府請訓、</p>
<p>此聞現信不論國聨之趨向何若、日本必將待國聨大會發表報告與建議後、再行决定其應否退出國聨、然即使日本决定退出、亦須待發出通知兩年後始生效力、其時將在日本對盟約上一切議務履行之後、而國聨則雖接日人通知、仍能預聞中日爭執如故、</p>
<p>此間雖有數人贊成十九國委員會去年十二月所草决議案不能再加討論之説、但英人則聲稱、當時委員會給與主席希孟之訓令、有充分伸縮餘地、可以准其重加考慮云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日十九國委員會舉行會議各界均極重視、再則國聨方面之形勢、今已至極緊張之地位、因國聨方面所提出由日本暗中操縱之修改案、反對者不止中國一國、其他會員國亦多持異議也、</p>
<p>日内瓦方面對於日本代表松岡所送達之照會、均極淡漠、而對於日本之斷然拒絕美俄之加入調解、尤爲注意、現在各方所紛紛討討論者、爲英外相西門氏究竟是否將主張召集國聨大會特别會議通過李頓報告書一節、據觀察家言、英國之舉動、不過爲表示對於日本舉動之一種不滿、但同時未必能依照列强之意見、使國聨明白指出不承認［滿洲國］之存在云、頃巴黎晨報載一天津電訊、内稱、日本中村將軍發表宣言稱、日本爲安全起見、或須佔领北平及平綏路上之各要隘、以防止中國之繼續動員云、此處見此紀載　多批評、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日方某重要發言人今日聲稱、吾人在此謀取妥協、而非抵牾、若十九特委會竟打銷中日直接妥協之可能性、而將此變爲國聨與日本間之爭議、是誠不可思議矣、吾人現並非未有挽回此不幸事件之希望云、華人方面今抱取持重的希望之態度、郭泰祺對路透訪員稱、現有理由可信事實到底漸趨入正軌、日人將被迫自抑、郭氏又稱、無論如何有賴於十九特委會辦理對於李頓報告書繕具報告之問題者尙多、中國久所望於國聨之道德上與法律上裁判、似不在遠云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）十九國委員會形勢、又復呈去年十二月二十日之原狀、日外務省　以如下方針、與國聨進行交涉、㈠國聨承認取消邀請美俄之件、爲當然之事、日本頗以爲滿足、㈡但不能以此爲交換條件、要求日本將受去年十二月二十日之舊决議案、㈢國聨應以援助中日直接交涉爲目的、組織與中日問題最有密接關係之英法意比四國委員會、㈣此委員會爲明確其性質與權限起見、除去［調解］之名稱、又不能無條件採用李頓報告書、爲其審議之基礎、㈤决議案理由書改爲議長宣言之形式、而删去否認、［滿洲國］之字樣、又改修决議案中其他必要之各部分、（十九日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）昨日十九國委員會曾向日本代表團提出問題、如將［邀請非國聨會會員國參加調解委員會］一節删去、日本能否接受去歲十二月間所通過之决議草案、關於此項問題、日本代表團業已向東京政府請訓、據日本人士宣稱、直至日本覆文到達時爲止、此間局勢仍然混沌、但日本代表團中最負責人士以爲該國覆文、若果使十九國委員會滿意、實出彼等意料之外、彼等正在認眞考慮、十九國委員會當有放棄調解程序而採用國聨會盟約第十五條第四項之必要、日本人士預料十九國委員會對於此種措置、即非全體一致、至少當可得大多數之贊成、遇有此種情事發生時、日本代表團將取何種態度、尙未可知、外間關於此事之消息、未免言之過早、日本最負責人士堅謂、即令十九國委員會主張採用第十五條第四節之程序、不經雙方當事國同意、而提出報告書於大會、并附以建議、日本亦不至立即退出國聨會、日本代表團至少當留居日内瓦數日、俾以旁觀人之資格、注視進展、藉知報告書之内容、然後乃離日内瓦而去、至少暫時不與國聨會合作、是則日本不至與國聨會决裂、絕裾而去、其所採取之態度、當與數年前阿根庭國對於國聨會所取態度、大略相同云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日帝國政府對於十八日十九國委員會所决定之以十二月十五日决議草案、作爲今後折衝之基礎、以爲僅撤回邀請非會員國、並不滿足、其關於小委員會之構成權限、及全部採擇李頓報告書之第九十兩章、似將提出重要修正、因鑑於德魯蒙案之旨趣、似於國聨與日帝國政府要求修正間、尙可設法、惟最難點在理由書改作議長宣言、與撤回在末項之不承認［滿洲國］之表明意思、但小國方面對之、似始終固執原案、故最惡情形時、最大限度之一部份讓步、似在考慮如下之妥協案、㈠以理由書爲議長宣言而减其效力、㈠日代表部對該議長宣言、應爲反對宣言、而宣明承認［滿洲國］之合理性及政治的意義等、該宣言應記載於議事錄中、（十九日電通電）</p>
<p>特委會</p>
<h3 id="c3">昨日開會情形 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會十八日午後四時集會、討論三小時後、决定向日本提議、</p>
<h3 id="c4">取消邀請美俄參加 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>如取銷邀請美俄加入調解一條、則日本應接受十二月二十日之草議案與理由説明書其他各條、於是日本現遇有願否接受李頓報告書認爲調解根據、抑或担負在原則上而非在法理問題上（如邀請非會員國參加事）與國聨决裂之責任、</p>
<h3 id="c5">預料調解終必失敗 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>國聨方面觀於今日之發展、預料十九特委會將於數日内向國聨大會報告調解之失敗、如日本不能依允收回其餘反對諸點、則此舉必不可免、就今日會議情形察之、十九特委會在作此决議時、已詳細考慮一切、今日討論之要點、在不於爭論衆所認爲空影之事件時犧牲實質、蓋美俄願否參加調解、猶在未定之天、且過去數日中、華盛頓傳來之消息、已表示史汀生遠東政策之無期賡續、今日特委會集會時、旁聽者較前爲多、新聞記者對於會議之拖延、表示大忍耐、</p>
<h3 id="c6">軟硬兩派短兵相接 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>並認此爲主張調解者與主張强有力手腕者短刀相接之戰爭、特委會討論日本之提議、歷時頗久、終覺有數點莫可接受、同時亦研究中國修正文、覺日本修正文足以挫弱特委會决議案、而中國修正文則使此决議案愈形强硬、但特委會以爲先處理日本反對點、而後考慮中國提案較爲敵宜、主席希孟説明日本所持非會員國必不可加入之爭點、並宣讀各種草議案、</p>
<h3 id="c7">小國代表主持正義 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>愛爾蘭代表勒斯特、即衆視爲小國之發言人者、起問日本所提出其他各點、其與中日爭議之解决有必要之關係者、究達何種程度、瑞士代表摩太發言頗多、對於日本之反對非會員國之合作、不認其在法理上有良好理由、但謂　不願斤斤以法理爭點而碍及此問題、蓋保障議案中眞正實質之效力、乃扼要之點也云、各發言人多表示日本决不準備接受草議案與理由説明書全文之意見、但議定推主席希孟向日代表松岡接洽、以期覓取日本之答覆、希孟當塲允之、至是會議遂終止、</p>
<h3 id="c8">調解决裂日負責任 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>今日特委會之討論、有時甚爲激昂但結果衆情一致、雖愛爾蘭代表勒斯特亦謂結果甚堪滿意、特委會以爲在勸令中代表放棄其修正文、並依允不請美俄加入調解之際、當不致遭遇多大困難、一般意見以爲特委會已採用一種敏捷的折衷辦法、此舉可使日本如不接受之、則負决裂之責、如接受之、則將如某特委所言、適暴露日本之大言欺入耳、</p>
<h3 id="c9">國聨處處暴露弱點 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>聞有人提議如無他種變化、則理由說明書可作爲主席宣言書、特委會對於此議、並不反對、因此舉可予兩造以提出保留之權、同時亦可緩和一般形勢、但非至决議案之問題解决後、此事不能决定、衆料今後數日内、時局將迅速進展、今之危局雖已展緩、但未挽回也、</p>
<h3 id="c10">十九特會發表公報 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>今晚八時十二分發出公報、其文如下、今日十九特委會研究今晨主席所接到之日政府提議、覺其提議與本會所贊成及送達兩造之辦法、在許多根本點上不相符合、日政府主要反對點之一、爲非會員國代表之參加解决提交國聨之爭議、苟此點爲日本對於議案原文之唯一反對、則特委會覺商諸兩造以解决　爭點、非不可能、故特委會認爲有再覓取情報之必要、允欲知如此項困難解决後、日本是否準備接受去年十二月特委會所繕具之草議案、接委會爰請主席偕國聨秘書長在此點上與日代表團接洽、然後再進行對中國代表團之談話、因特委會以爲先須確知日代表團之答覆也、特委會下屆會議定星期五日舉行、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c26">攘外與安内孰先？乃 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>我國當前之大患。爲外侮。爲内憂。外侮急。内憂亦急。故今日而言救國。自不出安内與攘外兩途。</p>
<p>然而處於當前情勢之下。吾人權衡緩急。攘外先乎。安内先乎。是蓋爲横梗於吾人眼前之一絕大問題。差以毫厘。即失之千里。此一問題如不能解决。則吾人之救國工作。亦終將無由而推進。</p>
<p>主張攘外必先安内者曰。今日對日戰爭。爲整個民族戰。必須全民總動員易言之。即必須整個政治健全。全民衆合力共舉。始能傾其全力。與暴日周旋。然而返顧國内。黨派之意見紛歧。强悍之軍閥割據。戰亂時作。盜匪遍地。青年憤懣。人心惶惶。以此沙散瓦解之民力。安能與暴日周旋。故今日而欲攘外。必先安内。</p>
<p>吾人之意見則正反乎是。</p>
<p>何以故。以我國今日所以釀成此現象。正由於政府對外。無一貫之政策與斷然之處置故。惟其無一貫之政策。故人民張皇而失措。惟其無斷然之處置。故人民怨怒而不平。禍發逾載。戰和莫决。卑怯者自因而銷沉。强悍者自因而憤激。於是而意見喧呶。各不相謀。旣無統一之主張。自無集中之力量。整個民族。散漫如沙。故目前補救之道。惟有接受大多數人民之要求。以决定對外之</p>
<p>大策。夫惟對外能有堅定之主張。而後可以使民心有所歸依。而後可以弭止黨派之紛呶。而後可以整飭廢弛之紀綱。而後可以樹立中心之勢力。反是則内决無由而安而外亦决無由而攘。此其一解也。</p>
<p>其次。今日我國内盜匪充斥。民不聨生。固亦爲顯著之事。實然而盜匪之所以充斥。則又恰爲列强數十年來對華侵略必然之結果。十年間關平銀三十萬萬兩之貿易入超。爲帝國主義對華侵略之直接成績。二十年間一百萬萬圓之内戰損失。爲帝國主義對華侵略之間接成績。目下農村經濟之崩漬。即爲帝國主義侵略之總和。而挺而走險之盜匪。又恰爲農村破産必然的産物。故就綏靖盜匪一點而合。尤先攘外。惟攘外乃能阻遏帝國主義者武力之侵略。亦惟攘外乃能阻遏帝國主義者經濟之榨取。救濟農村之道在此。安定民生之道亦在此。脫不阻遏帝國主義之侵略。而徒以高壓制止飢寒交迫之［匪盜］。則農村江河日下。人民歸死無所。挺而走險。其不流而爲盜匪者幾希。是則内究何年可安。外又更何年可攘。此又一解也。</p>
<p>我民族被宰制於帝國主義者鐵蹄之下。已歷時百年。而當前列强重新分割世界準備第二次世界大戰之說。更如瘋如狂。九一八禍變之爆發。亦即爲第二次世界大戰之前哨戰。故我民族。今日如猶不能認清當前之大難。不能集中我民族之全力。以與日本帝國主義作必死之戰爭。而徒孜孜努力於安内。是適爲帝國主義者掃盪投資之障礙耳。故吾人權衡緩急。在當前情勢之下。認爲欲安内必先攘外。今之倡［安内以攘外］之論者。徒欲藉以掩飾其卑怯而已。</p>

<p>兄弟前日得軍事委員會北平分會萬委員福麟來電、轉到馬主席占山電稱、去歲十月間、發總攻擊令後、在拉哈站·泰安鎭·克山·等處、圍攻月餘、終因彈盡糧絕、敵援迭至、且有蒙匪助虐、致我軍覆滅甚衆、爲保全實力起見、乃令齊克呼海兩綫軍隊、先後西行、期與蘇（炳文）軍取得聨絡、比至雅魯縣、即遭日軍攻蘇之役、　得已乃令部斌山·鄧文·檀自新·李忠義·等、率領所部西行、取道蒙古索倫山、向熱河前進、以便取得接濟、馬主席個人、則取道歐洲、擬向國聨報告暴日慘酷情形、近得確訊、中央已將馬主席與蘇司令所需川資匯去、馬蘇兩公、因華北宼深、憤慨異常、已用書面報告國聨、日内瓦之行已中止、即作歸國之計、而馬主席因所部已到達熱邊、將先由間道返國、統率所部、繼續抗日、</p>

<p>黑龍江省抗日各軍由鄧軍長檀副軍長邵軍長統率、到達熱邊者、約一萬五千餘人、由李忠義軍長統率者、約二萬七千餘人、總計所到達之隊伍、約四萬餘衆、此項軍隊、在馬主席督飭之下、首樹抗日旗幟、浴血苦戰、奮鬥經年、因彈盡衣單、繞道來熱、饖寒交迫、艱苦萬分、閱昨日鄧軍長致李銘新先生電稱、馬隊掛掌之費與拍電之欵、均無法籌措、其困難情形、可見一斑、查此項軍隊、對於抗日作戰、均有相當歷史、日多有犧牲勇氣、今以不得已而來熱、不早爲設法、使來者得充分接濟、早日返黑、繼續抗日、而留在黑境潛伏各地之隊伍、尙有四萬餘人、亦必因赴熱者查無歸期、皆相率追踪而來、若是、則必使黑省我所有之邊防義勇各軍、日人得不費一兵、不折一矢、即全告肅清、此與我國收復失地之整個計畫、有莫大影響、且暴日侵略華北正急、熱河已朝不保夕、爲釜底抽薪緩敵猛進計、此項開來之軍隊、應積極接濟、爲令該項軍隊加入熱河方面作戰計、亦應積極接濟、總之、東北淪亡、華北動搖、中華民族存亡與否、全看拚命的結果如何、黑省軍隊雖未能達守土之目的、然有此經年之苦戰、亦足以表揚我民族精神、故接濟此項軍隊、較之重新集結之隊伍、其收效自大也、</p>

<p>丨朱書麟君來信丨</p>
<p>不幸的我、因爲貧窮的原故，初中没有畢業，就中途輟學！自然，我們這半途輟學的青年的出路，唯一祇有去當商店學徒，我也逃不了這環境的支配，到這生氣毫無的舊式商店中來做一個不幸的學徒了。但是，我有我的希望，我决不肯就此停滯而不前，我時時在預備努力。我想；學生是國家將來的主人翁，前途希望是非常大的，但像我這人，學問毫無，社會上究竟何處是我立足之處呢？現在考試院成立，無論何人，必須經過考試，才能找到職業，而投考又必須有一定資格，像中學畢業大學畢業外國貿學等等，這些資格，我是一樣也没有，再去讀書嗎？那裏辦得到，那末我是不能去應考的了。旣不能應考，將來職業怎去找呢？唉！我恐慌極了！請先生想一個好辦法來指導我一下吧！］</p>
<p>覆；足下來書所云，有三個問題要答覆；第一個是一學徒］的問題。看來書的意思，頗以學徒爲不幸，這裏也應當分開來研究。若是你把你們從整個的學徒（成千成萬）的這一社會階層放在眼裏，和那些豐衣足食，坐擁巨資，駟馬高車的有錢有勢的人兒對立起來，發見了學徒們的不，幸這是對的，若果你只看見那些有錢有勢的人眼熱，以爲［彼丈夫也，我丈夫也］，彼能陞官發財而我爲何不能？方寸之間，起了欣羨，從此發展下去，假使你幸運，以後也變成了有錢有勢的人，那結果你還不是和他們一樣？一旦你做了老間，你也會像現在你的老閭一樣地對付你的學徒，或許更要厲害一點，那足下今日的念頭就是不對的。第二個是［第生］與［國家的未來的主人翁］的問題。照常理說來，學生自然是［國家的未來的主人翁］其實，學生們所站着的地位亦各各不同，在甲的立塲上，甲的立塲上的一方面的學生主人翁，而他的立塲上的學生都在被壓迫之列，同樣，在他的立塲上的學生做主人翁時，甲的立塲上的學生又被壓迫了。所以學生爲國家將來的主人翁］一句話，嚴格講來，實在不合邏輯。若果説某一階級的青年學生是將來的國家或社會的主人翁近情理一點。第三個是［考試］問題。其實政府的考試·僅僅限於公務人員·並不是説無論何人非經考試不得吃飯。公務人員就是一些官兒，你看着眼熱嗎？那就是你的［官心］未退，不然，你怕什麽呢？做個學徒的不好麽？若是你能死心塌地在學徒的社會中做一個頂天立地的人，爲學徒的社會爭得多少自由，給學徒的社會增得多少幸福，雖然自已吃苦，那實在比你做高官，做大老關要高貴得多，不然，你就是命的樣爬到官兒的地步，會做得幾句［等因］［奉此］的官樣文章，寫幾篇［先生八面鋒］的考卷，或是升到老　地位，有幾文錢，那也不過是官僚，財主隊中又添了一個新同志，而店員學徒方面又增加了一個敵人而已。我們决不願意你有這樣思想。</p>

<p>年來學風順敗、士習浮　、敎育破産之聲、且播於全國、有識之士、惄然憂之、佛海觀察所及、深知欲圖挽救、必先整飭學風、欲思整飭學風、又必須合學校家庭雙方之力、始克竟其全功、故特略貢愚誠、尙冀家是諸君諒鑒而採納之、</p>
<p>曩年頗有狃於自由主義之名、盛倡自由學風之說者、一人首倡、舉世風靡、遞演相因、遂成今日之　習、抗　干紀以搗亂爲革命精神、狂肆放恣以横决爲個性發展、以嚴格爲壓制、以秩序爲束轉、點者習於　謀、　者耽於浪漫、至於浮冀桀　、幾成爲普遍之惡德、於是在校則有　長擇師之潮、在家則高唱非孝革命之說、卽人類社會所賴以維　之根本規範、亦將衝决破壞之而後快、家庭不能約、師長不能制、卽政府之力、亦有時而窮、學潮之訊、日載報章、毛細之故、能掀大波、　始之端愈演愈怪、致令辦學者日夜憔神悴力、惟以　付學潮爲務、自由之弊、竟底於斯、此豈始倡者意料之所及耶、嘉榖之種、悉成　荑、芳草之根、化爲荆棘、國家興學三十餘年、其所取償之代價如此、爲國之憂、又豈下於外敵内患哉、</p>
<p>佛海審知　結之所在、毅然以爲今日欲言敎育、必當如武侯之治蜀、非濟之以猛、不足以促其自覺之心、非約之以道、不足以納於正常之軌、故力　自由之說、一本嚴格之旨、凡遇　潮發生、悉探斷然處置其有不率敎誨者、悉予以嚴峻之制裁、苟其所犯、情節過重、雖屆畢業之期、亦當忍痛而擯斷不因其一　之功、留此害　之馬、明知　習已成、所施成未能　爲人　、　因此而蒙高　之評、亦决不敢姑息以取悅於衆、佛海曩年亦曾主　大學、日　青年爲友、　有　　　殘之心、良以身　司敎之責、又審知　疾之所在、若復故事優容、以博寬大之譽、坐視敎育破産而不思力圖挽救、則佛海將何以副國家設官之旨、更何以慰家　　　之重平此　不電不預求諸　之諒解者也、</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>十八日那天，下了整天的大雪，這個龌龊的上海城，表面上倒也清白起來。黄皆時候，我　寒冐雪的出去解决吃飯問題，從那奔走雪地　　聲呌賣的報販手中，買了一張大陷報，帶到青年會食堂去，邊吃邊看。誰知打開報來看時，就有六個特號字的標題，　進我的眼簾，呌做［全部凍死山巔］中旁還有三行較小的字；［義軍四百至死不屈；］［酷寒中抵抗到底；［［死後仍堅執刀槍。］我只　了這幾個標題，就覺得有一股熱氣蓬蓬勃地地從丹田中直升上來，低誦着唐代死守　陽的張巡對南　雲說的話；［南八，男兒死耳，不可爲不義屈！］心想我國有這樣的執刀槍凍死山嶺，而不爲不義屈的四百好男兒，又連帶想起其他呑冰浴血誓死殺　的各路義勇軍，又那裏　是亡國之兆呢？我把這一段悲壯的新聞讀了又讀，喜怒哀樂之情，充塞了　懷，再也不能忘却，而吃下去的東西，竟停滯在腸胃之上，再也不能消化。我以爲這新聞有傳之永久以誌不忘的價值，就掬着一瓣心香，敬謹轉錄如下；</p>
<p>［困守岫巖之義軍鄧鐵梅部，於去年十二月中旬退入大孤山以來，在該山建造極鞏固之防禦陣地，謀長期抵抗，日軍嘉村旅團將該山句　，爲時已經半月餘，日軍於十一日派兵入山搜索，發現義軍屍體，計有三百八十具。彼等始終拒絕投降，在零下二十度之酷寒中，仍須强抵抗，卒因食糧不繼，被服單薄，悉數凍斃，形狀極慘！屍具中多數均穿夏服，凍斃業已多日，手中仍堅執刀槍，日軍頗爲感嘆。］</p>
<p>親愛的讀者，你們讀了這新聞作何感想！我們同爲中國之人，爲甚麽把這［執干戈而衛社稷］稷的重任，完全放在義勇軍身？，我們的數百萬勇於内戰的驍將健卒又在那裏呢？我們那些驕奢淫佚恒舞醋歌的大人先生，又如何對得起那抵抗到底凍死在山嶺的四百義士呢？唉！鄧部岫巖四百人，其可泣可歌，實猶過於當年的田横海島五百人。我願買絲繡之；鑄金事之，並願全國的文學家，以詩歌文章詠歎之；全國的藝衛家，以繪畫雕塑描寫之，使這四百人的國　，永垂不朽，中國雖亡，而這四百人的精靈不滅！</p>

<p>黄昏，白天與黑夜交替的時光，馬路上的萬盞銀燈，開始照見都市的夜生活中一般享樂與受難的人們。</p>
<p>寒風怒吼，向富有者獻媚，對窮愁者施暴。一輛輛汽車衝破了寒風，馳向戲院，舞塲，酒家，旅社，飯店，總會。丟看戲，酒綠燈紅中挾了顫動着肉體的舞女歡娱，醉飽，聚會，密約，賭博。總之是唯物的享樂。</p>
<p>同時在寒風中窮愁者在陋巷破屋中合家啼泣；饑寒交迫着。還有在寒風中工作，圖明朝的一飽。在那街燈之下，還可以看見一般出賣青春，出賣肉體，挼碎靈魂的女性，在鴇母的淫威下希望有一個客人做伊火坑中一日的救星。</p>
<p>啊高樓大厦重裘疊貉，爐子水汀，酒醉飯飽，香烟，女人享樂，在這樣環境中有什麽殘酷的寒風？</p>
<p>在饑寒交迫，妻泣子啼，窮苦掙扎的包圍中，只有一個肉身，沸着熱，血跳着赤心來抵抗這時代社會所給予苦煉的大難。</p>

<p>記得從前在做學生的時候，有一位很嚴厲的國文敎師，他的綽號專制先生，因爲他時常歡喜擬着關於［專］字的文題，［專業說］啊！［專斷辨］，［共和與專制論］啊！非特如此，並且凡屬他所擬定的文題，不准用［的了着麽］的語體，須得做［也哉乎焉］的文言。所以他們便給他取上了這個［名副其實］的綽號，我做他的文題時，總是恨在小　　　年以拉黄包車　傳一時之大學生陳怪佛君工書反字此其一也學時没有讀上了四書五經，然而却又不得不硬湊着幾百個字來繳卷。起初尙可以敷衍他的［專］字題，可是他接連着幾個［專］於是便把康熙字典上，［寸］字部的東北僞執政溥儀，又想做本皇帝了。愛談自由的同志，還得用着［專一］的决心討伐呢。</p>

<p>— 了紅瘦鵑</p>
<p>從東方别墅到池塘邊的路上，很是幽靜，但東方生夫婦和歐陽生却常到此處。在以前，有時載笑載奔前後走着，現在却又不然了，小曼會喊道；［小水獺，不好嗎？我們挽着一並走。］於是伊左手挽了丈夫，右手挽了小水獺，無顧忌的笑着走着。小水獺是常掛在小曼口邊的，自從最初一次說笑之後。</p>
<p>記得有一個早晨，東方生在書室裏讀詩，他無心外出，祗小曼偕同歐陽，手理着魚竿，又走向塘邊去。他倆在一株埀楊下坐下來，岸上露水未乾，青青一片。他把魚竿垂下，儘自同小曼說笑，雖是浮子動了幾次，他却始終未曾舉起。他贊美着小曼；說伊的眸子像魚兒一般靈活，眉尖像頭上的柳葉一樣細長，最後他囁嚅了好久道；［曼，假如我有了你這樣一位人物來做我的伴侣，我一切都願犧牲了］丨東方夫人聽了他的話，却不以爲忤，伊仰天哈哈一笑，把頭撲的倒在他肩頭，儘把眼珠向上注視歐陽生的面部，相互的一笑；伊是笑他的痴心，而歐陽也正笑着伊的天眞呢。</p>
<p>在這時候，東方生未嘗不知道歐陽有愛小曼的表示，這能夠在幾方面可以看得出來。他同時雖又很明瞭兩人的坦白與純潔，但對這一張偶然在歐陽書桌上發現的字條，却又誤會起來。内有幾句道；［我爲着你孤單，飄零得像游子還不如，所以肯予你一種安慰，使你即在睡夢中回憶，也覺得甜蜜。你有時談得很肉麻，我不問。但請你避却鸚鵡的前頭，因我不望那頭鸚鵡，學得像你一樣浮滑］他認得是小曼的筆蹟，不禁凄然了。</p>
<p>病弱的人，最經不起剌激，就這樣的一個情形底下，使東方生漸漸消瘦起來了，他舊病夾着新愁，祗有沈重下去。歐陽生每日向城市裏奔波，延醫買藥，東方生却全無起色。時光又挨近深秋了，東方生一天要求小曼與歐陽挾他到池塘邊去，在路上，依舊是並走着，但並不說笑。東方生向池塘邊巡視了一週。柳葉正飄滿了池塘，遮住了微波，他苦笑着向天道；［吾主，我在此處把我交還了與你吧。］（二）</p>
<p>首·［專］字項下的註解，一併改頭換面的寫了上去，什麽［專者，即壹也，亦一也；專業者，學業專致於一也］，搬上了一套［惡札］。</p>
<p>現在，時代變遷，［專］字的地位已根本動搖，所以［專制］已經死掉，而其凡屬［專］字所專有的名詞，也給西洋文字奪去了。如［專斷］已一變而爲法西斯蒂·［專業］不妨改爲托拉斯。</p>
<p>更有進者，［學業專一］的名詞，現在亦已不摩登，至少要改稱［學術萬能］或［做官第一，學業第二］。</p>
<p>非但［專］字的字面被人侵佔，而且它的意義亦已變動。瞧，能治［内，外，婦女，小兒各科］的，無所不能的萬能醫生，招牌上或者卡片上却必需印上］專治各科］，倘使不放上［專］字，即有人懷疑醫學的不精深。</p>
<p>總之，［專］字已經落伍，［專一］更無須談起了，然而已經死掉了的［專制］却又在反動起來了。得瞧瞧着，日本人塑着快别了你的愛人罷丨把强寇驅出關外收復東北失地，纔是我們青年的責任。</p>

<p>丨善卷洞之游丨</p>
<p>游覽片刻，由儲翁導游上洞（又名暖洞，亦名大氣海），洞口　知垣，與中洞後部相毘聨。入口，左右均有石級可登。月色矇矓，雲霞飛舞！别有天地，疑非人間。　廣約十畝，分上下二層，如舞臺廂樓然。天生大石柱二，　峙其間。洞内共燃汽燈五六，隔數丈視之，宛如窺明星於雲隙。石級環繞，曲折迴旋，山氣磅礴，壁潤而澤，温喛如入浴室。加以柟檀乍蒸，香霧馥，郁始悟頃所見月色飛霞，卽山氣燈光之幻象耳，儲翁云；是氣惟冬令有之，嚴寒尤甚，大雪之際，雖袒裼裸裎，而不覺其寒，燃炬夜游，則幻景重重，有雲天霧海之妙，誠奇　也，乃仗電炬，循石級，往返盤旋，升降數四，究不能辨其容積幾何也。</p>
<p>游畢，折回螺巖小築，復趨下洞。洞較中洞爲高。高峻處，須千尺電炬，始能照及。前有小瀑，名　音堅，水雖不宏，而苔綠欲滴，泉韻迸　。洞中怪石岞崿，峭壁硬岩，標奇　　，磊磊倒懸洞頂，設風颷微動者，或將隨白雲飛翔也。壁上異石，幻作松形，直幹凌霄，横柯擎蓋。入内漸狹，杳冥幽黯，茫無所見，凡三里而達後洞，惜未往探也。返螺　小築，儲翁已備茶點相候。席間致歡迎詞，由該團常委姚元幹君答謝。</p>
<p>略憇，出巢許堂，越小嶺而達後洞（又名水洞）。洞在山麓，廣尋丈，高祗數尺，形如半月，藤葛如幕，飛烟冥垂，一水澄清，直入洞］</p>
<p>際。洞口小舟一，可容八人，舟子手槳銜炬。　員中先至者趣登，温槳入，約二十分鐘始出。洞内進　曲折，深達六十丈，高處可丈許，低處則須蜷伏舟中，始能通過，石紋斑駁，陰森寒冽，如入地府。惜人多時促，勢難徧游，計共入二次，載十八人，時已三時餘矣。余至遲，不得與焉；然留此爲重游之券，亦大佳事。乃與儲翁握别，訂明日游庚桑之約躦程登舟，夜間八時抵宜。</p>
<p>丨庚桑洞之游丨</p>
<p>念六日晨，至東門外登舟。道出東氿，河道較狹，往來船隻亦夥。先抵蜀山觀紫沙窑，午刻泊湖汶鎭，登岸步行約七里，抵朝陽道院内供張公像，院内有甘泉碑。更進，抵孟峰山之庚桑洞，洞爲周亢倉子隠居處，庚桑其字也，周處風土記，謂漢張道陵修道於此，故又名張公，或云爲果老證果處，詳不可得而考矣。時儲翁等已相候於此，導人後洞，洞甚高廣，石級數十，直達平臺，乃跨大繁背轉人前洞，洞名天籩大塲，大可十畝，曠然如大厦。鐘乳下垂，凈明皎潔，大者數抱，小亦盈握，如垂嬰珞，如懸冕旒，如龍鬚，如虎齒，如珠幡招展，如檐溜冰筋，玲瓏瑰異，莫可名狀；大瓔珞天之名，不虚傳也。洞之上口，雜樹葱翠，暗香撲鼻，陽光内透，飄飄欲仙，兩傍石級參差，盤旋四達，如履危棧，如登天梯，榮迥環繞，直達峯嶺。返顧洞口，如巨怪張吻，若欲擇人而　，以膏其利齒者。登陟畢，儲翁已於天　大塲中，羅列果餌香茗相欵，乃羣進茶點，儲翁略述洞中勝跡及交通狀况，税務司楊明新君及名畫家胡伯翔亦相繼演說。</p>

<p>丨陳小較安利售開二千包丨</p>
<p>（客秈）昨日客秈到銷兩淡、到頭雖有少數抵申、但貨主擬擯守不賣、以待明年新正紅盤中再行出售資得善價也、但去路各帮均淡、因大結束期已近、本客各方均結束之意、祇福州泉州兩帮尙有辦意、但並不貪辦、亦抱定非廉不買之旨、昨日在市擇巧辦去湖南機油米七百包、價九元一角七公三一角此價比前市稍低、照市價則須九元二角外、因年底　欵急求、故比較便宜也</p>
<p>（洋米）久無交易、因買賣雙方、談價未能接近故也、昨忽有安利洋行售開陳小　米二千包、由行家國進、價做八元、較前似已稍漲矣、期貨尙無活動心思、因恐蹈前歲　本之覆轍耳、</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>二二癩痢吃過早飯仍然懷着新鮮的心情來到東村。他一路走來，很可以聽到一些關於王老四發瘋的原因，因爲許多人都在談着這一新聞。但是這對他似乎並没有必要，而目［耳聞不如目見］，何不直到王老四家　去看他一個青紅皂白呢？主意已定，二癩痢便直向狗兒媽媽家裏那邊奔去。</p>
<p>在二癩痢看來，這村莊褒今天確實有點異樣；　如王老四門口，就不知在什麽時候站滿了好些人，據他的經騐說來，除了那年王老四討老婆的時候也有過這樣的熱　村外，今天却還是第二次。</p>
<p>二癩痢的身材生得太矮，就是踞起脚來也只有大人的肩膊那末高，於是他使力的從人們的胛下鑽着進去，他看着王老四坐在那裏捉虱子了，這使二癩痢非常失望，原來所謂瘋人與普通人並没有多大不同的地方。他還是那樣滿下巴的鬍子，又　又醜，使他疑心那裏面一定也有不少的虱卵。他没有什麽新奇的動作，只是捉着虱子往嘴裏送去。而最使二癩痢掃興的，便是他並不說話。旣然是一個瘋子，而又不說話，還有什麽意味呢？眞的，没有什麽好看。</p>
<p>許多人都慢慢的散開了，並不見得怎樣開心。只有小孩子却還留在這裏。二癩痢當然也不想立刻就走，也許還有什麽好看的花樣兒在後面哩。</p>
<p>果然，瘋人站起來了，小孩子都突然的　了一跳，於是大家跑開，二癩痢也跑，不還他想；［哼，現在花樣兒來了。］</p>
<p>瘋人奔出門來，直往前跑，並且大聲呼喊</p>
<p>［來，大家跟我來，燒他媽的房子去！］</p>
<p>燒屋去？燒誰的屋呢？大家都不知道。不過這是瘋人的話，誰信他？所以大家也就不大追究。可是王老四仍往前跑，許多小孩子都跟着他，其中也有年紀不大的女人，大隊人馬，浩浩蕩蕩，到也十分熱閙。燒房子？眞的燒里去嗎？到也滿好看的。所以大家也就跟着看熱　去了，就連平素不入出門的狗兒媽媽也在其内</p>
<p>可是出於意料之外，瘋人王老四却停在宗祠的旁邊不走了。當然，這又是新花樣了。</p>
<p>在宗祠的走　黑暗處，那裏有一隻瘦得可憐的老雌狗在乾草堆裏生産。已經有兩隻生了出來，身上披着一　油黏的日膜，還有一隻頭已生了出來，只得母親再使力一次，便可完全得着他的生命，可是雌狗却在留着最後的一口呼吸，　然没有這最緊要的一股勁了。</p>
<p>瘋人此刻眼睜睜的望着他們，眼睜裏閃着可怕的兇光，然而小孩兒們都非常快樂，他們看見了這些小生命在輕微的　動，不禁拍着小手天眞的敵笑起來，只有婦人們才深知這狗母親的痛苦，都懷着極大的悲哀垂憐這隻瘦狗。</p>
<p>［哦！也許這隻小狗始終生不下來哩！。。］</p>

<p>— 陽春</p>
<p>自從榆關陷落，石門吃緊以來，在報紙上，我們又隨時可以讀到將軍們慷慨激昂的［枕戈待命］［負弩請纓一的通電。從在朝的以至在野的的，從軍長以至旅長，你一通電來，我一通電去，忙做一團，大家都有［救國不敢後人］之槪。就是正在忙於巷戰與肉搏的［劉家將］，也通電表示［停止内戰，枕戈待命。］甚至在烟台著有政績的劉珍年將軍，前幾日也曾電京請纓，表示願意率師北上抗日。對於這些激昂慷慨的請求，中央照例都是［温慰有加］，或是覆以［靜待後命］。尤其是對劉珍年將軍，於［温慰有加］之外</p>
<p>［努力建設］。彼呼此應，節拍調和，如聽黄鐘</p>
<p>令人心曠神怡！</p>
<p>本來］抵抗［而曰［長期］·中央的眞意，聰明如諸將軍者，夫豈不知？明知［請纓］决不會［照准］］，所以偏來一個［請纓］。這樣，旣可以張張虚聲勢，又可以表示［救國不敢後人］，何等漂亮丨而明容如中央，自亦深知將軍們的用意，更深知［請纓］就令［照准］，將軍們也决不肯毅然率師北上，不如率性做一個順水人情，旣覆電溫，慰又勉以［？！？！］，這樣，也旣可以表示中央早有成竹，又更可以使將軍們驚服中央的明睿。一切盡在不言中，彼此心照不宣，於是絲竹合奏，調和的音響，播於全國！</p>
<p>然而除了一雙耳朶以外，人民也還有一雙明竂秋毫的眼睛！［萬目所視，萬手所指］，調和的合奏，滑稽的雙簧，終於是不能麻醉人民的性靈的啊！</p>

<p>— 冰女士</p>
<p>病了，現在我是眞的病了。</p>
<p>一個人到了病的時候，脾氣和心境完全和好的時候兩樣；什麽都引不起興趣，什麽希望都没有，對於最親近的人也發生不出情感，只有煩悶，只有消沈，只想到死，想到世間的一切都是空虚；；。</p>
<p>啊，病，這實在太可怕了！</p>
<p>有錢的人是不怕病的，他們無論得了什麽病，都可醫好，有錢住醫院，有錢施手術，有錢吃藥，有錢打針，有錢吃補品，中國的莫干山，西湖，療養院如果覺得不好，便一溜烟跑到外國去，多麽寫意丨可是没有錢的人呢，不但有了病不能請醫生診治，不能　養，並且仍然要不斷地拼命工作。不做，你用什麽來過日子呢？誰也不願意活活地躺着餓死的呵！</p>
<p>唉！説這些費話幹什麽？我是病了，但這有什麽法子呢？病了還不是病了？</p>
<p>太痛苦了，眞的，我覺得世間再没有比病還痛左苦的了！砍頭，打靶，這是一刹那的痛，而病則不管日子多少，總是比砍頭打靶還要苦。好好地一個人　在床上，不能動作，只有活活地怱忍受痛楚，想到外面的人在快活地談笑，强健地行走，努力地做着各人的工作，美麗的希望在微笑着向他們招手。但是我呢，什麽也不能，什麽也没有，只等待死神降臨，將我靜悄悄地，像吃了安眠藥水一般地帶去地獄。</p>
<p>不過，這的確太便宜了我的敵人，如果我眞的病死了的話。</p>
<h3 id="c253">論［自殺］ <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 曹如蕙女士</p>
<p>幾天來，報紙上得多的關於自殺的新聞。有的是爲憂憤國事，有的是爲迫於生計，有的則是爲情慾。有人說；自殺是一種勇敢的行爲，是美的毁滅。叔本華也曾說；［自殺何罪］？對於這種主張，我是絕對反對的，我認爲自殺是一種絕對卑怯的行爲，因爲自殺者便根本没有迫視黑暗與［慘酷］的勇氣，尤其没有和［黑暗］與［慘酷］决鬥的决心丨</p>
<p>對於［生］，我認爲應有兩種解釋；一爲［生存］一爲［生活］。前者是無意志無目的的，［存在於世間］，而後者則是有［活力］有目的的［生活］。在這世界，本來有許多人如行屍走肉似的，如影子般的，如幽靈般的，只在空間佔下一個位置，絕無［生命的活力］。他們活着只是爲了享樂，爲了掠奪人家勞働的果實。這樣的生，自然是生不如死。對於這樣的生，我的主張是；</p>
<p>［如像粘葉一般的生，不如像落花一般的死］！</p>
<p>何况他們的生還根本比不上枯葉，因爲枯葉至少還不會掠奪新葉的水分和肥料。假如讓這樣的生加速死滅，自然我是十二分的贊同。</p>
<p>但目前一般的自殺者，並不是養尊處優的行屍走肉，也不是掠奪大衆底勞働果實的魔鬼，而是被壓迫人羣中的一個被壓迫者，是黑暗與慘酷的牢獄中的一個囚徒。被壓迫者和囚徒是有生命活力的，他們是世界的　持者，所以他們不應該自殺，只應該奮鬥！爲了自已，爲了人羣，爲了歷史的將來。</p>
<p>國事　　，爲什麽會如此？生活逼迫，爲什麽會如此？推而至於求愛不遂，失戀等，無不應該追問一個［爲什麽］？這世界本來是太黑暗了，百不當不意，眼前只是一片呌苦聲，呻吟聲，飢寒聲，弱者的哀號和强者的歡唱在空間交響。然而你得問爲什麽會這樣？這世界爲什麽會黑暗？你該找出一個主犯來？你該找出一個對頭來？捱了魔鬼的鞭打，反叮咚向黄浦江裏一跳，或是吃一杯安眼藥水，這是何等的卑怯？我認爲惟勇者才能迫視黑暗與慘酷，亦惟甬者纔能從黑暗中求光明，從慘酷中找幸福。自殺，爲什麽？爲人？爲已？强者在向你的卑怯的血發出蔑視的笑，和勝利的笑，你的死，適足使黑暗的時間更爲延長。羅蘭夫人曾說；［我不自殺；我如自殺，當先殺死幾個敝人］！這裏，我更進一步認定；［我不自殺！我要堅决的和黑暗奮鬥到生的最後一刹那］！</p>
<p>只有奮鬥的死纔是勇敢的死，才是美的死，才是有意義有價值的死！自殺，爲了什麽？爲自已？爲人羣？</p>
<p>所以，我堅决地反對自殺！因爲這是潑在奮鬥的火焰上的一盆冷水！</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>自然界再不能驕傲地說；［我能創造美麗而神秘的雪花］了，現在，事實上，我們已能造出同自钉所創造的一樣的雪花。</p>
<p>第一位研究這幕奇劇的人是ＪｏｈｎＭｅａｄＡｄａｍｓ，他是美國加利福尼亞大學的物理敎授，他親手制造花，并且觀察雪花的變化。</p>
<p>製造的方法是；先和合　種空氣，一種空氣是乾　而温度在冰點之下，另外一種空氣是潮濕而温度較高。當這兩種空氣和合時，卽造成了雪花而片片紛飛，最後落在一個可以觀察的小洞内，於是利用顯微鏡就在那裏拍照，并觀察雪花的組織順序。</p>
<p>雪花初成時，像一種結晶體，牠的直徑不過一時的萬分之四，卽將雪花十五粒排列在一處，尙不及人身上毛髮的寬大。最簡單的形狀是六邊棱形體，高寬幾相等。雪花增大時，牠的形狀依然不變，迄其達原形的十倍以上，始　易形狀。有時在增大時，兩片雪花結合在一處而成一種長的棱形體，但是牠的内部則空着，好像蟲蛙壞了的牙齒一樣，或者形成爲了的形式。</p>

<p>又是下雪，白色徿罩了整個的大地，使窮人們感着無限的恐佈。但是，丨　　因爲［雪兆豐年］，於是老學究們托着烟袋，捋着鬍，對着白色的河山，懷着重大的希望；［明年也許又是豐收吧？不過孟夫子却說，［樂歲終身苦］，哎！］喟然長嘆，</p>

<p>— 展能</p>
<p>棉·毛·絲·等各種織物的染色，在今日已成爲一個極重要的問題，這原因是爲了它用途的繁廣吧！</p>
<p>論到染色術的最早發明者，却是我們中華民族的先祖哩！這有古史可以考查，查時，我國的帝·王·公·侯·和人民，他們衣裳的顔色都有區别，那時染色術之盛想見一斑。惜乎歷代視工業爲賤業，因而墨守舊法，不知改良，遂成今日的衰敗現象！</p>
<p>一八五九年，人造染料逐漸發達，因而染色術受其影響，乃成化學工業的一支部，由此遂用化學的理論及科學的方法，研究改良，遂成今日之最新式染色業。</p>
<p>以上是關於本文的一些介紹。現在可以說到正文。</p>
<p>在鹽基性染料染色術中常用的幾種染料如下。</p>
<p>紅ＦｏｃｈｓｉｎＣｅｒｉｓｅＳａｆｒａｎｉｎ</p>
<p>黄ＰｈｏｓｐｈｉｎＡｕｒａｍｉｏＣｈｒｙｓｉｄｉｎ</p>
<p>綠ＭａｊａｃｈｉｔｇｒｏｅｎＪ</p>
<p>藍ＡｎｉｌｉｎｂｌａｎＭｅｔｈｙｅｎｂｌａｎＩｎｄｎｌｉｎ</p>
<p>紫ＭｅｔｈｙｌｖｉｏｌｅｔｔＫｒｙｓｉａｌｌｖｉｏｌｅｔｔｅ</p>
<p>棕ＭａｒｒｏｎＢｉｓｍａｒｋｂｒａｎｎ</p>
<p>用此種鹽基性染料所染之色，至爲　艶業　，此項染料又能於同，染　中染色，而得異常鮮艶之和合彩色，惜不甚耐光而已。其具有强耐光性者僅藍色染料之ＬａｄｕｌｉｎＭｅｉｈｙｌｅｎｂｌａｎ兩種。</p>
<p>在染色時，不宜將染料溶液一次加入，須分二三次陸續添加。鹽基性染料最忌與酸性染料相混施用，因有不溶性之沉澱發生，致汚織物，且所染之色不能匀和，是須注意。</p>
<p>棉之鹽基性染料染色法。</p>
<p>先使棉織物經　酸，如五倍子，兒茶等媒染劑之媒染處理後，然後染色能使色質耐用。</p>
<p>媒染法可用熱水將棉織物浸透，絞乾，浸於媒染劑之溶液中，靜置十二至二十四小時，壓乾，浸入銻鹽溶液，如酒吐石。（此物易溶於水，須加入碳酸　少許以中和游離之　酸，方能保存。）於是作用而發生鞣酸銻，固等於纖維。</p>
<p>受媒染後之棉織物，然後浸入弱鹽基性之染料溶浸内，加熱至攝氏六十度，固着之　酸鞣遇染料即化合爲鞣酸氣化銻色鹽，此物有極强之附着力，故有極强之耐洗性及耐皂性。</p>
<p>染畢後，用清水洗凈。即得。（染料及媒染劑之用量有定，均以織物之重量爲衡。）</p>
<p>毛之鹽基性染料染色法。</p>
<p>此項染色法不需補助劑，能直接染色，頗易得匀和之彩色。</p>
<p>在染色時，可先將染液熱至攝氏三十度左右，然後將羊毛織物没入，漸漸增高其熱度，至八十度，保持一小時即可取出　凈。此法不宜用沸熱之染</p>
<p>因羊毛吸收色質於高温度時較低温時爲速，故其所得彩色之光澤較遜。</p>
<p>以馬賽皂Ｍａｒｓｅｉｌｌｅｒｓｅｉｆｅ少許加於染液中，則可得極鮮艶之彩色。但染色時温度不得超過五十度。可先以水與皂相和，煮透，將所生黏沬濾去，然後方可應用，否則成品將生花斑及汚漬，極不雅觀。</p>
<p>絲之鹽基性染料染色法。</p>
<p>絲在常温時亦能吸收鹽基性染料，故其染色法與毛織物同。但宜以生絲皂Ｂａｓｔｓｅｉｆｅ（爲含有溶解絲膠質之皂液。）加入染液，使彩色易於匀和。染液温度不得超過攝氏五十度。</p>

<p>— 符</p>
<p>丨我房子所得的體騐丨</p>
<p>一天晚上我們决計要搬屋。因爲這麽小的一間前樓，再也擠不下我們這許多人了丨我老阿哥，老望，以及阿張夫婦等。最起先自然是老阿哥提議的，因爲老阿哥是我們這幾個人的領袖。他　天地　着一　　　片　　　存　　　　　寫稿子，最近因爲添加了高多人，實在使他有些坐不安穏　而且下面的二房東太太又時常賭輪盤麻將發脾氣，半夜三更的，會　　大哭起來。我們都感覺非常不便。這夜老阿哥提議了以後，接着就有我和老望齊聲的附議。馬上就决定明天一早全體出發尋屋。並且以法租界西面爲假定的區域，以一亭子間一樓爲目的的屋子，而以每月二十五元爲標準的租費。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，大家嚼完了油條，祇留了阿張的夫人看家，我們四個人跳上了電車，浩浩蕩蕩的向法租界馳去。我們都是外鄕人，一切都是［莫明其妙］的，老阿哥比較有經騐，因此他就打頭走，走到霞飛路吕班路的轉角，老阿哥挑起了眼鏡，一眼望見右角的電桿上有紅紙招租廣告，就呌老望跑過去一看，却原是［重傷風出賣］的紅紙條，那紅紙條旁邊雖然有［召租］可是不合［目的屋］原則的。又看了一張，就不管三七二十一地衝了進去，一個很漂亮的俄國少婦，出來，操着極流利的英語招待我們，老阿哥也詰屈敖牙地和他講，但這個俄婦却不理會老阿哥，時時朝着穿　汁長寿蒸窩牛汁麥精魚肝油百齡　柏耳自未血補力　牛奶白補酒補丸</p>
<p>西裝的老望看，口如懸河的老望竟急得像熱鍋子裏的螞蟻，他簡直不會講一句英語啊。後來知道了房金要在四十五兩以上，我們就掉頭跑了。從此以後，我們不知走了多少路，穿了多少條的弄堂，衝了多少次數的門。跑了多少部的樓梯，以及不知聽了多少種的語言，看了多少種的奇形怪狀，嗅了多少種的氣味。這樣，一直到了夜分，我們四個人仍是［不知所云］地回到家裏，只博得阿張嫂的一聲冷笑。</p>
<p>第二天，第三天我們仍是繼續地努力，不過我們從經騐得了敎訓，曉得以小白臉的老望打頭陣，是有不少便利的，於是老阿哥祇得退居其次了。我們儘是找着，但却儘是無着，我們雖感着幻滅的悲哀，但我們却也有着安慰；因爲我們爲了找屋，却不啻把上海社會的一般家庭狀况視察了一番。阿張還帶了一本小册子，隨時把經歷的情形記錄在裏面。好奇的興趣鼓起了我們，簡直忘了我們的目的。我們也就不焦不，急無掛無慮了。三天以來，我們大槪找過三十二家房子。這三十二家的房子，大致是都合乎我們的理想，但竟没有一家合乎　準的租費，據阿張的統計；；</p>
<p>四十五元以上者三　　四十五兩以上者一</p>
<p>四十元以上者五</p>
<p>三十五元以上者八</p>
<p>三十元以上者一五</p>
<p>合計三十二</p>
<p>最普通的數目，是三十四五元，但這數目眞離我們的標準太遠，我們只有望洋興嘆！甚至當我們望洋興［嘆］的時候，還挨了少奶奶們幾頓［屈死］的辱駡。雖則如此，但［上海家庭］的密室秘窟，却給我們游覽個爽快，烟霞洞，竹林坊，花柳館，似乎我們都曾見識過了。各地各方的人，都有，但以南方人而尤其是蘇州人爲最多（這自然單就和我們直接接洽者而論）據統計；</p>
<p>蘇州人一三</p>
<p>寗波人八</p>
<p>上海人七</p>
<p>江北人二</p>
<p>北平人一</p>
<p>俄國人一</p>
<p>合計三二</p>
<p>這其中又不知怎的，尤以［女人］爲最多，這是事實。但這也眞是不可思議的事實。阿張的統計簿上寫着；</p>
<p>少女或女婦一三</p>
<p>中年婦人五</p>
<p>老媪三</p>
<p>中年男子三</p>
<p>少年男子一</p>
<p>小孩或傭婦二</p>
<p>男女共同接見者五</p>
<p>合計三二</p>
<p>這眞是我們意想不到的事，在三天以内，我們會看到這麽多各種各樣的女３</p>
<p>人？赤着脚　拖鞋的，蓬頭垢面的，濃妝艶抺的，烟容滿面的。請看統計表；（我們遇見的女人爲二十六人參看上表）</p>
<p>烟容滿面的二</p>
<p>濃裝艶抺的五</p>
<p>赤脚趿拖鞋的一○</p>
<p>蓬頭垢面的二</p>
<p>没有特點的七</p>
<p>合計二六</p>
<p>觀上表·可見濃裝艶抺的，幾乎佔到二分之一，他如［蓬頭］［烟容］，······也有三分之一零。蓬頭拖鞋，足見懶惰性的發展，烟容滿面，足見其頺廢性的成長，濃妝艶抺，則又［非吾所得知也矣！］了。</p>
<p>總之，我們找了三天屋，雖然終没有找到，至今我們還是在前樓裏擠着，但我們却已巡閲了一會大都市的中等階級家庭了。家庭是社會最基礎的單位，我們三天來［巡閲］過的幾十個小社會實是社會的陰　面！</p>
<p>讀者如果不相信，不妨也去［巡閲］下吧！一·十三！燈下</p>

<p>黄金是用淘汰或混汞法從沙或嚴石裏取得的；並不含有毒性，爲什麽人呑了牠就會致死呢？並且爲什麽以羊頸骨炭服之，即可安然從肛門而出呢？致死之由，及服羊頸骨炭可解的作用，究竟是怎樣？</p>
<p>雪是水蒸氣遇冷而凝結成功的；冬雪如此，春雪也何嘗不然，但是我們爲什麽歡迎冬雪而深惡春雪呢？（下略）</p>
<p>朱慈年</p>
<p>編按者；人呑金後，因爲金子的性子是很重的緣故，每每停滯腸内，致腸斷而死，我國丸散裏的少量金箔，不致殺人；與夫呑了大量除金以外的金屬，也要送命；明就是証，並不是因爲毒發而致死，所以解救的方法，只須使之隨大便由肛門排出，即可安全，不需要解毒的，查骨炭（不限羊頸骨）原有吸收腸内水分，使之極度乾燥，增加蠕動的能力，以促進排洩的效用；不過力量太小，不能有萬試萬應的把，握朱君這個方法，不知從何得來？我們以爲遇到呑金的人，終以送醫院求治，方可計出萬全呀！</p>
<p>雪是水蒸氣遇驟寒而凝成的結昌，誠如朱君所謂冬雪如此，春雪也何嘗不然，但是冬天的時候，所有田裏的冬季作物，彵的生命力都潛藏在地下的根裏，抵抗力非常强大；同時爲害農作的昆蟲，以及遺下來的卵子的生活力，却非常薄弱，因此冬雪於作物無損，而可以殺死害蟲，但是一致春天，那就不同了，植物的潛藏力向外發展，枝葉潮萌，抵抗力隨之减退；同時害蟲的生機已轉，因此春雪非但不能殺死害蟲，反足摧殘作物，我們歡迎冬雪而深惡春雪的緣故，就是爲此。</p>

<p>這張片子内並且顯出道　　的嘉實也能說笑話。有一天當門諾伐　到「大飯店」的攝影塲來望她，當時她尙渷有到　　　來，這天拍的息「大飯店」裏她的房間的　幕，所以電門就　在一間放這神望的嘉實的衣服的衣樹内。後來嘉　來了，開始預演。她表演憤激的様子，同時别的人湝伏在附近等諾伐羅表演他的戲　。</p>
<p>衣樹門突然開了，嘉實吃了一驚。</p>
<p>好，還有仕磨人跑出來麽？一嘉實問，無疑地她想到了ＫeystodeKopo的老聞車了。</p>
<p>正像我們的預料一様，這名片裏有根多幽默的地方。嘉實在這片子内唱一只德國歌，呌ＩchLiebeDich，她從前會唱這只歌倵回想對於　調方面回復她的記憶。所以曾配了一只　琴和一個琴師。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥做書記的一角，在幾幕内她要表演打字。瓊在家裏專用一種打字機的。因爲她要表演得迫眞，而祇有某種的打字機能使她工作得這様。所以公司代她外面找了只新的，影她租下了。</p>
<p>其時約翰巴里翰亞對於供給部裏拿出來幾種書很喜歡。這大約是因爲這些老版古書，是他正在搜集的綠故。他得到他要的書。價錢是由他的哥哥里昂在不知不覺中付的，因爲當供給部問他那書價要不要上在帳上的時候。他很生氣他說··</p>
<p>「不要，我和公司沒有什麽往來，介是我哥哥有帳上好了。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽我有這種書賬？」幾天後里昂驚吼道··「我從沒有買過書啊。」</p>
<p>「啞，是的，你買的，」弟弟約翰答道··「爲我買的。」</p>
<p>里昂每天要費去一小時，化裝甘金的一角，這矮小多病的德國人，决在「大飯店」中消麽他最後一刻的生命。</p>
<p>因爲像上面已經說過，這張片子内，「大飯店」自己占最顯著的地位，並且超過各演員。所有的動作都在飯店内表演。每一個人生命都給大飯店的影響所制服，所以當一個酒排間的侍者，調和飲料的時候，一個女傭整理房間的時候，他們都是同等重要的。</p>
<p>因要使這飯店詳述無逍遺，所以沒有一些瑣事的遺留或露破綻的。每一間接應室上的指示都用德文。電話總局有柏林電話局，卽養花店裏花草也照柏林最新的尖角式排列的。</p>

<h3 id="c265">評東北義勇軍浴血戰史 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>

<p>曁南影片公司出品</p>
<p>北京大戲院開映</p>
<p>又是一部東北義勇軍的實地戰事影片。</p>
<p>無疑義的，在目前的中國，這様鼓勇民衆爲民族而戰的影片並平厭多，就是再多幾部又何妨呢？</p>
<p>再說前日中央開映的「東北義勇軍浴血戰史」，爲九星公司出品，和本片本爲同一性質的作品，但是北京大戲院的廣告中有「當心冒充」等字様，我想這又何必呢？</p>
<p>關於本片的技巧，當有略說幾句的必要，雖然在前線攝製，本來就十分難困，很少考究技巧之可能。本片的編輯，比較的很有「系統」，但沒有「對比」的力量，而且敵方的殘暴亦很少暴露。換言之，沒有更明顯的顯示義軍的作戰之艱苦光線欠明晣，當然是因爲戰地不能使用燈光，但Film亦大有關係。因爲小公司的資本不足，以致機械不精的關係，於星鏡頭亦顯得呆笨而不靈活，字幕太麻胡，而且字幕所告訴觀衆只是狹小的國家觀念，而沒有更進一步的去抓緊更偉大的民族意義。其實，整個的課題，忽視了直接被蹂躝於帝國主義鐵歸之下的大多數民衆析要求。</p>
<p>但是，我人們應當百二十分的原諒它，在這様難困的工作中，能夠有這様的成績，已經是夠使我們滿意了。何况這是一部反帝的影片。所以我還是和看了九星公司的「東北義勇軍浴血戰史」以後一様的（請參照昨日本刋影評）勸上海的人們以看其他影片的金錢去看看這張影片，以電影娛樂的興緻去體認我們弱小民族的痛苦，而努力爲我們中華民族的前途堅决奮門。</p>

<p>外寇深入，國難日亟，我們處在後方的民衆，還有得吃，還有得穿，並且還有得娛樂，因此有一部分人說後方民衆貧着娛樂，簡直忘了埀危的國家了··也有一部分人爲娛樂辯護說··娛樂不忘救國，救國不忘娛樂，如這次新世界的援助東北義軍游藝大大會，便是在娛樂之中，寓救國之意。我以爲前後兩種意見，都有相當的理由，高談救國的人，本不必敵視娛樂，因爲一方面從事嚴重的救國工作，而一方面作極小限度的消散的娛樂，實在不能算怎様的不合。兵士在前綫衝鋒肉搏之餘，如果在壕溝内唱唱戲曲，開開話匣，這我們不該就稱他們爲喪心病狂的舉動吧？</p>
<p>有一天，我在某影戲院觀影，開映了約一小時之後，照例休息了十分鐘，便又繼續開映··但在開映之前，嚇然映在銀幕上的，却是一段驚人的新聞消息，寫着··「九門口已失陷，我軍民死傷甚衆，現我軍正在某處佈防，作堅守」。全院的人見了這段消息不絶地噓噓地歎息，於大家全神貫注在影片情節之中，忽來了一段國難消息，彷彿大家吃了一帖清凉劑！我以爲影戲院如能利用這様的機會，把時局的新聞，以及國難的消息，就以這様的巧妙方法，灌注到每個觀者的心坎中去，迹件事是値得贊美，和値得鼓勵的！</p>

<p>我深知道中國電影界苦楚有許多地方，都是心有餘而力不足的，所以批評電影的人也都應加以諒解而不可深責的。不過在可能範圍内的小動作上，也極應加以注意，整如戰地歷險記中，似乎有這麽兩點是不合乎情理的；</p>
<p>丁明霞因冒險戰地，所以才換了一身鄕下人的裝束，不過當他被囚而自願出首時，脫去其長統老布禨，忽然現出一雙高跟的皮鞋來，這似乎是令人莫名其妙！若以高跟鞋套上長統老布襪，再穿上男人鞋，這是不可能的事，若說從匪營臨時找到的，那也是不合情理的，</p>
<p>丁明霞的盜軍用地圖，在全劇中是一個很大的關鍵，但是我們要曉得他所盜的一張軍用地圖是一張什麽地圖？我可發誓說；他所盜的，是一張極普通的中國全圖，這也是不合情理的，因在一張極普通的中國全圖上，計劃某一個地方的軍事行動，亦屬滑天下之大稽了，何况丁明霞千辛萬苦的盜回來，官長們交相稱譽而引爲奇功呢？</p>

<p>「你是不是要向我購買一些重要的文件？」那意利人問。</p>
<p>「先讓我看看，」保羅說。「這裏沒有别人。」保羅看見那意大利人從身邊抽了一個橡皮布的皮包。</p>

<p>Canceling the Invitation to the US and Russia to Uphold Last Year's Five-Power Draft Agreement</p>
<p>Great Disappointment that Our Country's Requests for Amendments Were Ignored</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Our delegation in Geneva telegraphed to the capital on the 19th, reporting on the situation of the Committee of Nineteen's meeting on the 18th. The Japanese side strongly opposed inviting the US and Russia to participate and explicitly denying the puppet organization. During the 18th meeting, it was indicated that the invitation to the US and Russia could be withdrawn, but it was hoped that Japan would fully accept the remaining articles. It was decided to give Japan a final opportunity for consideration, with a continued meeting scheduled for the 20th. If the Japanese side does not agree, the failure of mediation will be reported to the General Assembly. (19th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Many believe that the proposal to withdraw the invitation to the US and Russia will not necessarily salvage the situation, as mediation has already essentially failed. However, it is now a gesture, giving Japan various opportunities to avoid a break. The Chinese side views yesterday's proceedings as disappointing. It neither fulfills China's demands nor strengthens the resolution. There is no word of criticism for Japan's actions, and no clear rejection of recognition of [Manchukuo]. Although this is the final resolution, it does not indicate that new proposals from Japan will not be accommodated. Independent observers view yesterday's meeting with indifference, believing its outcome is a major concession to Japan. The suggestion not to invite non-member states to participate in mediation is already a Japanese victory, so there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the situation because the door to negotiations is still open. The above are the views of various parties related to the League of Nations regarding the current state of affairs. The confusion of the situation is evident. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After a three-hour meeting of the Committee of Nineteen today, it can be considered virtually certain that the US and Russia will no longer be invited to participate in resolving the Manchurian issue. It is reported that the names of the US, Russia, and other countries were not mentioned at all during today's meeting and were consistently referred to as non-member states, which is also noteworthy. It is also heard that the proposal to remove the invitation to the US and Russia was originally put forward by Chairman Hymans and Secretary-General Drummond, with the support of several other countries. As for the position of British Foreign Secretary Simon on this matter, the spokesperson for the British delegation stated that he was not yet prepared to comment. However, some diplomats here claim that even if the US and Russia were invited, it would be highly questionable whether the two countries would accept. Therefore, if inviting them would place Japan in a position of being responsible for disrupting mediation, it would be better to decide not to invite them.</p>
<p>Japanese representative Matsuoka stated that if this renewed effort to resolve the Manchurian issue fails again, the committee seems likely to consider adopting Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. However, he has just received instructions that, regarding proceeding with Article 15, Paragraph 3, if there is a motion to invoke Paragraph 4, he must seek further instructions from the government.</p>
<p>It is currently believed that regardless of the direction the League of Nations takes, Japan will wait until the League of Nations General Assembly issues its report and recommendations before deciding whether to withdraw from the League. However, even if Japan decides to withdraw, it will only take effect two years after issuing a notice, at which time it will have fulfilled all its obligations under the Covenant. The League of Nations, even after receiving the Japanese notice, will still be able to hear the Sino-Japanese dispute as before.</p>
<p>Although some here support the view that the draft resolution prepared by the Committee of Nineteen last December cannot be further discussed, the British claim that the instructions given to Chairman Hymans by the committee at that time had sufficient flexibility to allow him to reconsider it. (18th, Guomin News)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today's meeting of the Committee of Nineteen is being given great importance by all sectors. Furthermore, the situation at the League of Nations has now reached an extremely tense state, as the amendments proposed by the League, secretly manipulated by Japan, are opposed not only by China but also by many other member states.</p>
<p>The League of Nations community in Geneva views the note delivered by Japanese representative Matsuoka with great indifference and is particularly concerned about Japan's resolute rejection of the US and Russia's participation in mediation. What is now being discussed is whether British Foreign Secretary Simon will advocate convening a special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly to pass the Lytton Report. According to observers, Britain's actions are merely to express dissatisfaction with Japan's actions but may not be able to follow the views of the powers and make the League of Nations clearly point out that it does not recognize the existence of [Manchukuo]. Recently, the Paris Morning Post carried a Tianjin dispatch stating that Japanese General Nakamura issued a declaration stating that, for security reasons, Japan may need to occupy Beiping and the key points along the Ping-Sui Railway to prevent China's continued mobilization. The record of this here has drawn much criticism. (18th, Guomin News)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A certain important Japanese spokesperson stated today, "We are here to seek compromise, not confrontation. If the Special Committee of Nineteen destroys the possibility of direct Sino-Japanese compromise and turns this into a dispute between the League of Nations and Japan, it would be truly inconceivable. We are not without hope of salvaging this unfortunate event." The Chinese side is now adopting an attitude of cautious hope. Guo Taiqi told a Reuters reporter that there is now reason to believe that the facts are gradually moving towards the right track and that the Japanese will be forced to restrain themselves. Guo also stated that, in any case, there is still much to rely on the Special Committee of Nineteen to handle the issue of preparing a report on the Lytton Report, and that the moral and legal judgment that China has long hoped for from the League of Nations seems not far off. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The situation of the Committee of Nineteen has reverted to its state on December 20th of last year. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is conducting negotiations with the League of Nations with the following guidelines: 1. Japan is quite satisfied that the League of Nations acknowledges the withdrawal of the invitation to the US and Russia as a matter of course. 2. However, this cannot be used as an exchange condition to require Japan to accept the old resolution of December 20th of last year. 3. The League of Nations should organize a committee of the four countries with the closest relationship to the Sino-Japanese issue—Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium—with the aim of assisting direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. 4. To clarify its nature and powers, this committee should remove the term "mediation" and cannot unconditionally adopt the Lytton Report as the basis for its deliberations. 5. The rationale for the resolution should be changed to the form of a statement by the chairman, and the words denying [Manchukuo] should be deleted, and other necessary parts of the resolution should be amended. (19th, Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday, the Committee of Nineteen asked the Japanese delegation whether Japan would accept the draft resolution passed last December if the section on "inviting non-League of Nations member states to participate in the mediation committee" were deleted. Regarding this question, the Japanese delegation has already requested instructions from the Tokyo government. According to Japanese sources, the situation here remains chaotic until Japan's reply arrives. However, the most responsible figures in the Japanese delegation believe that it would be beyond their expectations if the country's reply satisfies the Committee of Nineteen. They are seriously considering that the Committee of Nineteen may need to abandon the mediation procedure and adopt Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant. Japanese sources anticipate that the Committee of Nineteen, even if not unanimously, will at least obtain a majority in favor of this measure. It is not yet known what attitude the Japanese delegation will take if this situation occurs. External news about this matter is somewhat premature. The most responsible Japanese figures firmly state that even if the Committee of Nineteen insists on adopting the procedure of Article 15, Paragraph 4, and submits a report to the General Assembly with recommendations without the consent of the parties involved, Japan will not immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. The Japanese delegation will at least remain in Geneva for several days to observe the progress as an observer, to know the content of the report, and then leave Geneva, at least temporarily not cooperating with the League of Nations. In that case, Japan will not break with the League of Nations and leave abruptly. The attitude it takes will be roughly the same as that taken by Argentina towards the League of Nations several years ago. (19th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Imperial Government believes that the Committee of Nineteen's decision on the 18th to use the draft resolution of December 15th as the basis for future negotiations is not satisfied merely by withdrawing the invitation to non-member states. Regarding the composition and powers of the small committee and the adoption of Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report in their entirety, it seems that important amendments will be proposed. Considering the spirit of the Drummond Plan, it seems that a solution can still be found between the League of Nations and the Japanese Imperial Government's requested amendments. However, the most difficult point is to change the rationale to a chairman's statement and to withdraw the expression of non-recognition of [Manchukuo] in the final item. However, the smaller countries seem to consistently adhere to the original plan. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, a maximum amount of concessions seems to be considering the following compromise proposals: 1. The rationale is to be a chairman's statement to reduce its effect. 2. The Japanese delegation should make a statement of opposition to the chairman's statement, declaring the rationality and political significance of recognizing [Manchukuo], etc. This statement should be recorded in the minutes. (19th, Den-tsu dispatch)</p>
<p>Special Committee</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yesterday's Meeting Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee of Nineteen met at 4 PM on the 18th. After discussing for three hours, it decided to propose to Japan:</p>
<h3 id="e4">Cancel the Invitation to the US and Russia to Participate <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>If the clause inviting the US and Russia to join the mediation is canceled, then Japan should accept the draft resolution of December 20th and the other clauses of the explanatory memorandum. Thus, Japan now faces the choice of whether to accept the Lytton Report as the basis for mediation or to bear the responsibility of breaking with the League of Nations in principle, but not in matters of law (such as inviting non-member states to participate).</p>

<p>The League of Nations, observing today's developments, expects the Special Committee of Nineteen to report the failure of mediation to the League of Nations General Assembly within a few days. If Japan cannot agree to withdraw its remaining objections, this move is unavoidable. Observing today's meeting situation, the Special Committee of Nineteen carefully considered everything when making this decision. The main point of today's discussion was not to sacrifice substance when arguing over events that everyone recognizes as empty shadows, as it is still undecided whether the US and Russia are willing to participate in mediation. Furthermore, the news from Washington in the past few days has indicated the indefinite continuation of Stimson's Far East policy. There were more listeners at today's meeting of the Special Committee than before, and journalists expressed great patience with the delay of the meeting.</p>

<p>And recognized this as a war of short swords between those who advocate mediation and those who advocate strong measures. The Special Committee discussed Japan's proposals for quite a long time and ultimately felt that there were several points that could not be accepted. At the same time, it also studied China's amendments, feeling that Japan's amendments were sufficient to weaken the Special Committee's resolution, while China's amendments made this resolution even stronger. However, the Special Committee felt that it was more appropriate to deal with Japan's points of opposition first and then consider China's proposals. Chairman Hymans explained Japan's insistence that non-member states must not participate in the dispute and read out various draft resolutions.</p>

<p>Irish representative Lester, who is seen as the spokesperson for small countries, asked what degree of necessary relationship the other points raised by Japan have to the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Swiss representative Motta spoke a great deal, not recognizing that Japan's opposition to the cooperation of non-member states has good reasons in law, but saying that he did not want to hinder this issue with legal arguments, as the key point is to protect the true substantive effectiveness of the resolution. Many speakers expressed the opinion that Japan was not prepared to accept the full text of the draft resolution and the explanatory memorandum. However, it was agreed to ask Chairman Hymans to contact Japanese representative Matsuoka in order to find Japan's reply. Hymans agreed on the spot, and the meeting then ended.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japan Bears Responsibility for the Failure of Mediation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Today's discussions in the Special Committee were sometimes very激昂, but the result was unanimous, and even Irish representative Lester said that the result was very satisfactory. The Special Committee believes that there should not be much difficulty in persuading the Chinese representative to abandon its amendments and agree not to invite the US and Russia to join the mediation. The general opinion is that the Special Committee has adopted a quick compromise, which can make Japan, if it does not accept it, bear the responsibility of breaking, and if it accepts it, then, as a certain special committee member said, it will just expose Japan's boastful deceit.</p>

<p>It is heard that someone proposed that if there are no other changes, the explanatory memorandum can be used as the chairman's statement. The Special Committee did not oppose this proposal, as this move can give both parties the right to make reservations, and at the same time can ease the general situation. However, this cannot be decided until the issue of the resolution is resolved. Everyone expects that the situation will develop rapidly in the next few days. Although the current crisis has been缓, it has not been saved.</p>

<p>The communiqué was issued at 8:12 PM tonight. The text is as follows: Today, the Special Committee of Nineteen studied the proposals of the Japanese government received by the chairman this morning and felt that its proposals did not conform to the methods approved by this committee and sent to both parties on many fundamental points. One of the main points of opposition of the Japanese government is the participation of representatives of non-member states in resolving disputes submitted to the League of Nations. If this point is Japan's only opposition to the original text of the resolution, then the Special Committee feels that it is not impossible to discuss with both parties to resolve the dispute. Therefore, the Special Committee believes that it is necessary to seek information again, willing to know whether Japan is prepared to accept the draft resolution prepared by the Special Committee last December after this difficulty is resolved. The Special Committee then asked the chairman to contact the Japanese delegation on this point together with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations and then proceed to talk to the Chinese delegation, as the Special Committee believes that it is necessary to first ascertain the reply of the Japanese delegation. The next meeting of the Special Committee is scheduled for Friday. (18th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Ding [Shiyuan], a traitor, issues false declarations to conduct counter-propaganda</p>
<p>Our embassy in England strongly denounces his lies</p>
<p>(London) The declaration by [Manchukuo] representative Ding Shiyuan that Rehe Province is subordinate to Manchuria has now been denied by the Chinese side in London, saying that Rehe has always been included in the Chinese territory. When the Manchu emperor entered China, the province was occupied. The Chinese embassy in London declares that [we must never sit idly by and watch the loss of our territory. Rehe is an integral part of Chinese territory, and we must rise up to defend it. The Japanese army's attack on Rehe may be delayed until March due to weather conditions, which will give us a temporary respite. We must know how to handle ourselves, but this 休战 is purely due to weather conditions, so it cannot last long. This is knowable.] (19th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Ding Shiyuan, representative of the puppet Manchukuo, has arrived in London after passing through Moscow, Warsaw, Berlin, Geneva, and Paris and has issued a declaration. Now, according to the principle of recording everything heard, the various points said are summarized below for reference. He said "I am a former Chinese military officer, now coming to Europe to defend [Manchukuo]. Rumors about this [new country] are often inaccurate. We have not been able to formally correct them at any time, because so far, only Japan has recognized the existence of [Manchukuo]. However, we are not in a hurry to seek the formal recognition. We trust in the power of facts, and the facts can defend us. As for what we have already implemented, since 1930, all foreign debts have been guaranteed and repaid. Our first batch of payments can reach 55% of the total amount of foreign debt, of which 30% was repaid in 1931, 25% in 1932, and the remaining 45% will be repaid in 20 years, plus interest at 3%, which is more than what China has ever done. Also, the National Bank has stabilized the currency. The budget for September 1932 to June 1933 has been finalized. Only the customs system remains the same, and the customs officials have been replaced. China has imposed separate taxes on [Manchukuo] goods, so we have no choice but to use the same method to deal with it. The Manchu army initially had 200,000 people and has now been reduced to 100,000. This is unknown to the outside world. The reason is that soldiers are paid by name, so the number still appears to be decreasing. Our soldiers are now fighting alongside the Japanese army, but they are not, as rumored, attacking Rehe, but only seeking to defend Rehe. The province, for centuries, has been an integral part of Manchuria, along with Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. Rehe is outside the Great Wall, and has always been the hunting ground for the emperors of the Qing Dynasty. On the Chinese side, the province is not very important, but on the [Manchukuo] side, it is different from the [national] perspective. We will certainly fight for the province with all our strength, but Zhang Xueliang will certainly not fight. The result of this battle will be enough to destroy his army, so there is no need to worry too much about the war. Manchuria will be satisfied once it restores its original borders and will no longer think of crossing the Great Wall except when provoked. However, there must be a neutral zone on the Great Wall. [Manchukuo] is an independent country, not a Japanese colony. [Manchukuo] has a national flag and a national anthem. What it has given to Japan is what Japan has already obtained from China through treaties. Since the declaration of independence on February 18, it has been approved by a free referendum by the people. Manchuria is only restoring its position 300 years ago before the Qing Dynasty ruled mainland China." Ding Shiyuan still has a week's stay in London and will purchase a warship for the training of naval personnel. After that, he will go to Paris, Brussels, Rome, etc., and then return to Changchun.

<p>Deterioration of US-Japan Relations</p>
<h3 id="e13">Important Meeting Between Roosevelt and Hoover Today <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Following the Old Ways of Xiao Gui Cao Sui in Far East Policy</p>
<p>Resumption of Diplomatic Relations with Russia to be Realized Soon</p>
<p>(Washington) President Hoover and President-elect Roosevelt are scheduled to meet on Friday. What they will discuss will be the US-Japan relations involved in the Far East situation. Roosevelt has made it clear in his declaration to the public that he will continue Hoover and Stimson's Far East policy. The repeated statements of the US policy towards China and the repeated violations of the rights of Americans and their industries in the Far East, such as the destruction of the Yokohama Shokai Company and the Osaka American City Bank branch, and the beating of the US consul in Shenyang by the Japanese, have all made the tension between the two countries even greater. It is rumored that people in the Japanese Ministry of the Army are distributing newspaper news that can incite anti-American sentiment, and the Ministry of the Army is paying no attention to it. The United States is even more angered by this news. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) Today, it was learned from reliable sources that after the new US President Roosevelt takes office, the United States' diplomatic policy on major current issues, except for war debts, will all remain the same as before and will continue to progress. It is said that this decision is the result of Roosevelt's meeting with Stimson, as Stimson's recommendations are completely consistent with Davis's recommendations, with few differences. Therefore, Roosevelt is determined to follow the old ways and not change from the past. According to a certain key member of the Democratic Party, this can be called Roosevelt's policy on issues such as disarmament, the Far East, the world economy, and the relationship between the United States and the League of Nations. However, this policy will certainly progress. Roosevelt's acceptance of Hoover's invitation to meet at the White House today is one proof of this. It is said that the two sides will mainly discuss diplomatic events, and the Far East issue is expected to be considered first. As for Roosevelt's position, it is heard that he will insist on maintaining the 5:5:3 ratio of the British, American, and Japanese navies and must maintain it until a better method is obtained. It is also heard that the new president will advocate building the strongest possible navy within the reasonable and feasible limits of reducing military spending and will never allow the national defense force to be weakened and will advocate adding warships to the treaty limits, but at the same time will seek genuine disarmament. As for the Far East issue, it is said that he agrees with the current policy of not recognizing what is obtained by military aggression. Also, regarding the World Economic Conference, it is heard that Roosevelt's policy is practically the same as Hoover's policy, but he may not be as insistent on limiting the scope of the agenda, and he advocates that in addition to convening an economic conference, existing diplomatic agencies should also begin meetings, hoping to mutually reduce tariffs. It is said that this plan has been supported by Roosevelt's adviser Colonel House, who has thoroughly studied the impact of the Republican Party's high taxes. As for the issue of the United States joining the International Court of Justice, because Peck's advocacy of joining has aroused a reaction of disapproval from the public, it is heard that Roosevelt will at least temporarily shelve it and will handle it when there is a need to deal with it in the future. Also, regarding the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia, it is heard today that Roosevelt has not yet decided, so he has not yet expressed his position and will probably declare his attitude at the time of his inauguration or within a short period of time. As for Roosevelt's war debt plan, no hints have been obtained from key members of the Democratic Party, but it is expected that it will differ from Hoover's position. It is rumored that the Democratic government will favor agreeing on a total amount and issuing international bonds, but when asked about this, key members of the party refused to confirm or deny it.

<p>Japan's Administration of Various Islands</p>
<h3 id="e14">Installation of Fortress Works <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The United States is Extremely Concerned</p>
<p>But Denies Encouraging the League of Nations to Investigate</p>
<p>(Washington) With the current attempt in Geneva to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute apparently reaching a dangerous situation, the Far East situation has become more important than all international issues. It has also been reported here that the League of Nations, in view of Japan's potential withdrawal, is now planning to investigate the Japanese-administered islands in the Pacific, and that the United States has also encouraged the investigation. The State Department immediately denied this, saying that the United States has never encouraged the League of Nations to investigate the current situation of the mandated territories or Japan's installation of fortress works on these islands. Also, European news reports that if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations and still retains the mandated territories, the United States will be extremely concerned because of the danger to the Philippines. People in the State Department also declined to comment on this, only saying that the United States has never made any statements to the League of Nations, nor has it indicated to the League of Nations that Japan has installed fortress works on several islands. Later, the Japanese ambassador's office was asked whether Japan had installed fortress works on the mandated territories, and it was said that Japan had dredged several seaports to dock fishing boats and that there were no fortress works of any kind. Japan has fulfilled all its obligations on the islands. As for the rumor that the United States encouraged the League of Nations to investigate, it is not known how it originated, but it is definitely not from the Japanese side. Since Japan's administration of a part of the islands in the Pacific, there have been rumors from time to time that fortress works will be installed, but after Japan's solemn denial, they have been laid to rest.

<p>(Beiping) The Chief of Staff of Rehe, Li Zanting, reported from Chengde to Beiping that the Japanese troops at Nanling bombarded our positions once on the evening of the 17th at 8 PM. There was no contact on the morning of the 18th until this morning. The 6th, 7th, and 8th Divisions of the Japanese troops stationed in Lingnan are rapidly advancing towards Lingchao counties. The enemy troops of Sanjian Zheng are also advancing from their original station in Beipiao, reaching a location five li from Nanling. The Japanese armored vehicles in Nanling have removed their gun covers and appear ready to fire south towards our positions. On the morning of the 18th, two Japanese planes flew to Chaoyang for reconnaissance but did not drop bombs. At 11 AM, another Japanese plane took off from Wangjia Youfang in Kairu and was shot down by the Righteous Army of Feng Zhanhai using anti-aircraft artillery, destroying the plane and killing the enemy. In Kairu, the Righteous Armies of Feng Zhanhai and Li Haiqing are still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, which has not stopped. The residents of Kairu are terrified of enemy bombings and are fleeing to Chengde. There have been no major losses recently. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Rehe army reported from its defense area to Beiping that the Japanese army at Chaoyang Temple has been harassing our Nanling positions for days since the 15th. Our army has remained calm throughout. If the enemy advances, we will launch a fierce head-on attack. Because our terrain is steep and we are positioned high, the enemy has launched several fierce attacks but has not succeeded. Now the enemy has changed its strategy and plans to harass Lingnan County from the south. According to reports from the front, the enemy cavalry brigade has advanced to the Dashizizu area on the Rehe border and is concentrating there. Traitors bought by the puppet state are active in Yaowang Temple. The situation in Lingnan is extremely tense. Tang Yulin has transferred a certain unit to provide assistance.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army's plan to invade Rehe is actively underway. Most of the Japanese and puppet troops are concentrated in Jinxi and the Rehe border area. At the same time, the Japanese Kwantung Army in Korea is also passing through Shenyang to the west along the puppet Fengshan Railway. The enemy's recent actions indicate that a large-scale invasion may occur before the Spring Festival. The enemy plans to use the puppet troops of Zhang Bi and Ding Jin as the vanguard, with the puppet troops of Yu Zhishan as the rearguard. Zhang Haipeng's puppet troops will be responsible for attacking Kairu from the Tongliao area. The commander of the Japanese forward troops, Kato Eijiro, recently visited various places on the Rehe border to inspect and command the deployment of Japanese and puppet troops. There have been frequent small contacts between sentries on the front lines. Our army is firmly defending and waiting. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since the contact, the enemy forces at Nanling have been shelling our Koubeiyingzi positions with heavy artillery for days. Our army is responding calmly. The Japanese army has not succeeded and has retreated to Chaoyang Temple. Yesterday, three Japanese armored trains arrived in Nanling from Yixian, carrying about 700 Japanese soldiers. There were no actions yesterday, but the front line has become extremely tense. The enemy appointed Zhang Jinghui, the chief of the puppet military and political department, as the commander-in-chief of the campaign against Rehe. 50,000 puppet troops have already been mobilized, organized under names such as the National Salvation Righteous Army, the National Construction Army, and the Border Mobile Team. It is said that Zhang Jinghui will depart from the puppet capital of Changchun on the first day of the lunar new year to supervise the troops in Jinzhou. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops attacking Rehe are finding it difficult to succeed in the Tongliao area due to the large number of concentrated Righteous Armies. Therefore, the Japanese side has recently transferred Japanese troops from Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces to the Rehe border. The Japanese military transport is busy, and there appears to be a general offensive against the Righteous Armies in Tongliao. Only about 400 Japanese troops are stationed in the Chaoyang Temple area. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side has transferred all troops stationed in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Harbin to western Liaoning. There appears to be a large number of Japanese troops gathered between Jin County and Yuguan. Because the Japanese are deploying troops quickly, Korean troops can arrive at Yuguan within 24 hours, so no large number of Japanese troops are seen deployed on the front lines. Two Japanese divisions are stationed in the Rehe area. According to reports from Kairu and Chaoyang, there have been no conflicts between the two sides. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e26">What Comes First: Repelling Foreign Aggression or Internal Pacification? <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The greatest problems facing our country today are foreign aggression and internal turmoil. Foreign aggression is urgent, and internal turmoil is also urgent. Therefore, when discussing national salvation today, it inevitably comes down to two paths: internal pacification and repelling foreign aggression.</p>
<p>However, under the current circumstances, when we weigh the priorities, which comes first: repelling foreign aggression or internal pacification? This is a major problem standing in our way. A slight difference can lead to a great error. If this problem cannot be resolved, our work of national salvation will ultimately have no way to advance.</p>
<p>Those who advocate that internal pacification must come before repelling foreign aggression say: Today's war against Japan is a war of the entire nation. It requires the total mobilization of the entire people. In other words, it requires a sound political system and the combined efforts of all the people to exert their full strength and deal with the violent Japanese. However, looking back at the country, there are divergent opinions among parties and factions, strong warlords are dividing and occupying territory, wars and chaos occur from time to time, bandits are everywhere, young people are resentful, and people are panic-stricken. How can such a scattered and disintegrating national force deal with the violent Japanese? Therefore, if we want to repel foreign aggression today, we must first achieve internal pacification.</p>
<p>Our opinion is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>Why? Because the reason why our country has developed this phenomenon today is precisely because the government has no consistent policy or decisive action towards foreign countries. Precisely because there is no consistent policy, the people are panicked and at a loss. Precisely because there is no decisive action, the people are resentful and dissatisfied. The disaster has been going on for more than a year, and the decision between war and peace is uncertain. The cowardly naturally become depressed, and the strong naturally become indignant. As a result, opinions are noisy and do not agree with each other. Since there is no unified position, there is no concentrated strength. The entire nation is scattered like sand. Therefore, the current way to remedy this is to accept the demands of the majority of the people and decide on a major policy towards foreign countries. Only by having a firm position towards foreign countries can we make the people's hearts have something to rely on, can we stop the noise of parties and factions, can we rectify the abandoned discipline, and can we establish a central force. Otherwise, internal pacification will never be possible, and external aggression will never be possible. This is one explanation.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fact that our country is full of bandits and the people cannot make a living is also a prominent issue. However, the reason why bandits are rampant is precisely the inevitable result of the aggression of the great powers against China for decades. The trade deficit of 300 million taels of customs silver in ten years is the direct result of imperialism's aggression against China. The loss of 100 million yuan in civil war in twenty years is the indirect result of imperialism's aggression against China. The current collapse of the rural economy is the sum of imperialist aggression. And the bandits who take the risk are precisely the inevitable product of rural bankruptcy. Therefore, even from the point of view of pacifying bandits, repelling foreign aggression comes first. Only by repelling foreign aggression can we block the armed aggression of imperialists, and only by repelling foreign aggression can we block the economic exploitation of imperialists. The way to save the countryside is here. The way to stabilize people's livelihood is also here. If we fail to stop the aggression of imperialism and only use high pressure to suppress the hungry and cold [bandits], then the countryside will decline day by day, and the people will have nowhere to die. Those who take the risk will hardly not become bandits. In that case, when will internal pacification be possible, and when will external aggression be possible? This is another explanation.</p>
<p>Our nation has been dominated by the iron hooves of imperialists for a hundred years. And the talk of great powers redividing the world and preparing for a second world war is even more like madness. The outbreak of the September 18th Incident is also a prelude to the Second World War. Therefore, if our nation still cannot recognize the great disaster facing us today and cannot concentrate the full strength of our nation to wage a war to the death with Japanese imperialism, but only painstakingly strives for internal pacification, it is only clearing obstacles for imperialists to sweep away investments. Therefore, when we weigh the priorities, under the current circumstances, we believe that internal pacification must come before repelling foreign aggression. Those who advocate the theory of [internal pacification to repel foreign aggression] today only want to use it to cover up their cowardice.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese garrison stationed in Qinhuangdao has been sending six armed soldiers to guard the station since the 17th. They use the Boxer Protocol as protection, and we have no way to stop them. Their intention is that when necessary, they can first destroy our transportation facilities.

The area south of the railway in that area is designated as a warning line for the Kailuan Mining Bureau, with British naval landing troops on patrol and guard.

<p>Deng Xihou and Others Telegraph an Invitation to the Two Lius</p>
<p>To Come to the Provincial Capital to Discuss Publicly</p>
<p>(Hankou) Since the ceasefire in Sichuan, all parties have been守守原陣地 and the atmosphere of peace is very strong. Liu Cunhou, Deng Xihou, and Yang Sen are coordinating with all parties and have decided to hold a post-war meeting in Chengdu to devote all their efforts to resisting Japan and suppressing bandits. It is said that Liu Xiang, Liu Wenhui, and You Songyao will all support this proposal and will abide by the decisions of the Central Political Council to improve military administration, education, and other aspects. They will unanimously welcome Zhang Qun to Sichuan to discuss implementation. As for the provincial chairmanship, it seems that the time is not yet ripe. Liu Wenhui will most likely continue to serve temporarily, pending resolution by the Central Government. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Cunhou, Deng Xihou, and Yang Sen jointly telegraphed Liu Xiang, Liu Wenhui, and Tian Songyao on the 16th, saying that Sichuan has suffered greatly from this war, the people have been harmed by the fighting, all industries have stagnated, and the vitality is about to be exhausted. They have repeatedly received telegrams from the Central Government strictly ordering the cessation of military operations, and letters and telegrams from the public calling for peace have piled up. Fortunately, the war has stopped, and it is urgent to plan for the future. The central government's decree issued in the 17th year and the outlines of the negotiations in Sichuan and the proposals of the Ganjiang telegram have all been included. However, legislation cannot be self-executing, and discussion is even more important than practice. Now, we plan to respectfully invite you to come to the provincial capital to hold an open meeting to discuss implementation, so that the major sacrifices can be adequately compensated. Moreover, the violent Japanese are invading and have occupied Yuguan. The flames of war are spreading and have reached the borders of Sichuan. If it is not resolved in time, not only will resistance against Japan be empty talk, but suppressing bandits will also be restrained, giving people an opportunity, which is worrying. We believe that you love the country and love your hometown, and you will be able to comply with our request. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun is scheduled to come to Nanjing to visit Chiang within the next few days, ask for instructions on the direction of Sichuan affairs, and then depart for Sichuan.

The Central Government has decided to send commissioners from the Ministry of Finance, Education, and Industry to accompany Zhang Qun to Sichuan to investigate the situation in order to separately reorganize. It is said that the three departments of Finance, Education, and Industry will each send representatives to accompany him. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The envoys from France, the United States, and Italy were originally scheduled to come to Beijing on the 16th, when the 19-Nation Committee of the League of Nations would meet, in order to closely liaise with our authorities and convey everything. Subsequently, due to the Yuguan Incident and the continuous increase of Japanese troops, the interests of various countries in North China will obviously be affected. Therefore, French Envoy Wilden and American Envoy Johnson were unable to come to Beijing for a time. They telegraphed their representatives stationed in Beijing successively a few days ago, informing them that the situation in North China should also be noted, so they will not come to Beijing for the time being.

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Communications, the problem of changing the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau system is that the Remittance Bureau will be subordinate to the Postal Administration and subject to its supervision, rather than abolishing the original bureaus and merging them into the post office. The Supervisory Committee of the Remittance Bureau must still exist. This plan is currently being studied item by item by the Ministry and the Postal Economic System Research Association. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau believes that due to the sharp fall in the Japanese yen, various reciprocal insurance rates, such as parcel insurance, letter insurance, mailbox insurance, and remittance insurance, etc., for insurance amounts of 1,000 Japanese yen in the past, have now fallen. Since the insured amount is proportional to the value, if damage should unfortunately occur in the future, there will inevitably be a risk of compensation. Therefore, the highest insurance will be raised uniformly one month from now to compensate for the losses due to the fall in the Japanese yen. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Culture yesterday reporting the reasons for the increase and requesting approval. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang was scheduled to come to Jiangxi on the 20th, but that is now uncertain. Various circles in Jiangxi have again sent fervent, lengthy telegrams to the central government and Chiang, pleading for help. It is reported that the reinforcement division of Liu Zhennian has arrived in Yushan and Dexing from Zhejiang. The division of Liu Kan has also started from Hankou to Xunyang, and the remaining troops will follow. (19th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) All circles, deeply worried about the communist bandits, fear that Chiang will not come. Over fifty public organizations sent an urgent telegram to Chiang yesterday, stating that banditry is rampant throughout Jiangxi, encroaching on the hinterland, with a full-scale invasion. Jinxi has fallen, Dongxiang has been looted, Chongren has been occupied, Linchuan is surrounded, and Nanchang is threatened. People's hearts are wavering. Should there be any oversight, the bandits will move down the Yangtze River, and half of Southeast China will be lost. With the capital threatened, how can we resist Japan? The survival of the nation depends on this single move. Furthermore, commercial associations and other groups telegraphed Chiang on the 15th, stating that eastern Jiangxi has become a haven for bandits. Chongren and Xuwan are firmly in their hands. Leping and Yugan are also suffering encirclement. Although heavy troops are stationed in Fujian, the bandit forces have not been weakened. The provincial capital is in shock. Jiujiang is an important town on the Yangtze River. Should it fall, the bandits in Anhui and Hubei will become even more rampant, and the overall situation will be beyond repair. This is truly a matter of national survival. (18th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Reports from the west bank of the Gan River indicate that the bandits have a "pseudo" Third Army Corps, a "pseudo" Eighth Army, a "pseudo" Independent Division, an Independent Regiment, and a "pseudo" Red Army School, along with defense bureaus in the provinces and counties, totaling 4,000 rifles.

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th - The work of the preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference is now nearing completion, so all parties are free to discuss its recommendations. The draft resolution jointly prepared by the American representative, Mr. Tan, and the Italian representative, Mr. Benidusi, is worded earnestly and movingly. The most important point is that the number of unemployed workers worldwide has reached 30 million. This number may be underestimated, as it should be at least between 75 million and 90 million when counting the families of the unemployed. Furthermore, the high tariff barriers that have been implemented by various countries in the past three years are also a major cause of the current economic depression.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 18th - Senators opposing Philippine independence are currently studying ways to prevent the implementation of the plan on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. However, since the constitution stipulates that Congress has the power to dispose of American territories and other property, legal experts have contributed very little opinion on this. According to news from the Philippines, the island's Legislative Assembly does not seem to be very much in favor of this plan, and it may not be eager to formulate a Philippine constitution. According to the provisions of the plan, Filipinos must formulate a constitution and submit it to the American President for approval within two years after the plan is approved. Therefore, even if Filipinos are restricted from formulating a constitution, if the American President is determined to prevent independence, it is very easy to do so: he only needs to refuse to approve the constitution, raise objections, and return it to the Philippines to be amended. Because the Philippine Legislature has no power to overturn the President's veto, this kind of rejection and amendment can often lead to indefinite delays.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Newtown Square, 18th - General Butler, known for his outspokenness, has been silent on current affairs for two months. He released his opinion on Philippine independence today, saying that after Philippine independence, it will become part of the Japanese Empire within two years. However, he does not therefore oppose Congress passing the independence bill, as he believes that Filipinos should be given freedom, as the island is of no benefit to the United States, and will only lead the United States into Asian wars. The Washington Conference Treaty prevented the United States from building fortress projects in the Philippines, and the island's current defense situation cannot withstand a genuine attack.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 18th - Today's New York Tribune attacked the US Congress for passing the Philippine independence bill, hoping that Filipinos would refuse to accept it, and criticizing Congress for disregarding national honor, not thinking about national business, and ignoring its obligations to Filipinos. It does not know what its intention is and is opening this absurd historical move of removing the American flag.</p>

<p>The Kokumin News Agency, Barcelona, 19th – Police discovered over 3,000 bombs and a large quantity of explosives in an anarchist bomb factory near Guadalajara. The police were alerted to the secret arms factory by a bomb explosion. Several key criminals were arrested on the spot. It is widely believed that after this case is solved, the anarchists' conspiracies in the region will suffer a fatal blow.</p>

<p>The Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 18th – The governments of Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Chile, and other countries jointly submitted a proposal to the International Labour Conference today, supporting the proposal for a 40-hour work week, stating that it is currently the only way</p>
<p>to alleviate unemployment. However, they also noted that attention should be paid to the daily lives of workers to ensure that they can maintain their normal standards. Furthermore, trade unions have also proposed that wages should not be reduced as a result of reduced working hours, and that the working hours of agricultural workers should be reduced equally. These demands are strongly opposed by employers. Therefore, the proposals of the governments of Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, and other countries are not without conflict with those proposed by the trade unions.</p>

<p>The expenditures in the 1933 budget had already been decided at 2.2 billion, but in October 1932, each department submitted a new demand totaling 2.9 billion, most of which was for war purposes. Although each department was making endless requests, the Ministry of Finance reduced the total to 2.2 billion. However, Army Minister Araki said, "At a time when the nation is facing a crisis of survival, should we be stingy with five or ten million yen?" As a result, another 100 million was added. Finance Minister Takahashi, having no other choice, had to issue new public bonds without limit. The increased issuance of public bonds caused inflation and rising prices, directly impacting the lives of the masses. The interest on the increased issuance of public bonds directly exploited the blood and sweat of the masses, shaking the stability of society. The broad masses of laborers fell into blatant poverty, unable to pay rent and land taxes. Therefore, the government allowed the payment of local fees in kind (even with payment in kind), but most people were still unable to pay. However, the government continued to demand payment, even stripping away anything of slight value. This shows that the root of the problem lies in the poverty of the masses.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Financial Crisis Does Not Harm the Private Enrichment of the Zaibatsu <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>All financial policies adopted to alleviate the financial crisis or to alleviate the panic caused by the financial crisis do not hinder the private enrichment of a small number of monopolistic capitalists in the slightest. On the contrary, the former can make the latter even richer, while also deepening the crisis. Taking this year's budget as an example, the military expenses (Manchurian Incident expenses and military equipment improvement expenses) are nothing more than a huge profit for the monopolistic state capital and the large zaibatsu such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi. They use intensive labor and low wages to desperately squeeze and exploit workers. The relief fund, that is, the business expenses for military civil engineering projects, is also transferred to the hands of monopolistic large capitalists due to the purchase of timber</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>and metal raw materials. Finally, the public bond expenses will further contribute a few interest payments to those financial capitalists. On the contrary, small and medium-sized enterprises have declined, and the laboring masses are still working desperately until they are shattered to pieces. As a result, class antagonism has become increasingly fierce and acute. In fact, the intensification of monopoly capital has long been a characteristic of the collapse of the capitalist system.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Ineffectiveness of Unemployment Relief and the Situation of Struggle <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Finally, regarding the relief of the 3.5 million unemployed, the government, in order to avoid the shaking of its own position, knows that it must provide a minimum level of relief for the struggle of the unemployed. However, this small amount of false benevolence cannot be achieved due to the financial crisis. This is the basic contradiction of the current wartime finance. The number of unemployed people is increasing, the state of starvation is worsening day by day, and the poverty of the laboring masses is deepening. However, they do not receive any subsidies or improved treatment from the government. Today, the united struggle of workers and farmers among the unemployed masses will inevitably become acute. And the financial crisis is precisely promoting the development of this situation of struggle. (Posted from Tokyo on January 10th)</p>

<p>The Spanish representative, Mr. Madariaga, said, "I fully agree with the opinion expressed by the Czech representative. It is my understanding that the Japanese representative may have misunderstood the procedures for discussing matters in the Council due to a lack of experience. The Japanese representative hopes that the meeting will not be prolonged, and this is our common hope. He also stated that if the members of the Council were to ask the chairman of the Commission of Enquiry for his opinion, the Council's session might be extended. He further stated that, according to the terms of reference of the Commission of Enquiry, the Council's appointment of the Commission was to request it to conduct an on-site investigation and report its findings to the Council. I fully agree that we should fully comply with the provisions of this term of reference. However, I have also carefully studied the section submitted by the Japanese representative and found that it does not contain any provision stating that the Chairman or members of the Council may not ask the Commission of Enquiry for its opinion on the report it has produced. We already have the report of the Commission of Enquiry on its on-site investigation. However, upon close examination of the terms of reference of the Commission, it does not specifically designate any one report. The Commission has already produced a preliminary report, so it would not be inappropriate for the Council to request the Commission to produce a further report if necessary. Therefore, I believe that the Council may well ask the Commission whether, after hearing the opinions of both sides here, it intends to change the report of its investigation on the ground. The report of the Commission of Enquiry is highly commendable, but although its evidence is extremely substantial, it is possible that not all of the Commission's findings have been included in the report, or that members of the Council still need to know these facts, which can only be ascertained by questioning the Commission in person. This is undoubtedly entirely appropriate. As to whether the Commission still exists at this time, I believe that there is no need for further discussion. The Commission was appointed by the Council and is one of its organs, but at the same time, the Commission has become one of the organs of the Assembly of the League of Nations. Therefore, I firmly believe that the Assembly of the League of Nations will not wish the Commission to be dissolved before it has considered the facts contained in the report. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Commission still exists and that the Council may consult it at any time. Moreover, the continued existence of the Commission provides the Council with many opportunities, and it would be very unwise of us to neglect this opportunity. In short, the Commission continues to exist and its services are still available to the Council. Therefore, if the Council deems it necessary, it may ask for its opinion on any point. If the meeting time is extended as a result, it is unavoidable. Furthermore, the discussion of this case has already been extended for more than a year, and it is unlikely that extending it by another month would be a matter of the utmost importance."</p>
<h3 id="e101">Drummond Cites Two Precedents <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Sir Eric Drummond, Secretary-General, said that it was customary for commissions of enquiry appointed by the League of Nations to be brought to Geneva to be directed by the Council without exception. For example, after the dispute between Greece and Bulgaria in 1925, a complaint was lodged with the League of Nations in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant. The Commission of Enquiry appointed by the League of Nations, chaired by Sir Horace Rumbold, also attended the Council meeting in December 1925. The last section of the terms of reference of the Commission stated that,</p>
<p>(The Commission shall conduct investigations on the ground and in the capitals of the two governments concerned, and the two governments shall provide the Commission with all assistance, provide all facilities, and take the necessary steps to enable it to complete its work.)</p>
<p>On this point, while the Council was considering the report, Sir Austen Chamberlain, who had submitted the case, proposed to ask the governments of Bulgaria and Greece if they had any comments to make. After the motion was passed, Sir Austen Chamberlain further suggested that the Chairman of the Commission be asked to indicate whether there was anything further to add. This is one example. There is also another example, namely the case of Mosul. When this matter occurred, the Council also appointed a Commission of Enquiry, chaired by General Laidoner, to prepare a report on the provisional border between Turkey and Iraq and submit it to the Council. General Laidoner also attended the Council meeting and provided any additional comments required by the Council at any time. The above two commissions of enquiry were both extremely important. Therefore, the procedures followed show the usual practice of the Council. There are also other similar examples, which I will present one by one if the members of the Council are interested.</p>

<p>Sir John Simon, the British representative, said, "Mr. Chairman, I have been hesitant to express my views when you have asked for opinions, as many of those present at the Council have more experience than I do. I believe that after listening to the statements of the Czech and Spanish representatives, we should all be very impressed, as both gentlemen have many years of experience with the Council's procedures. Moreover, the two precedents cited by the Secretary-General are sufficient to prove the truth of this practice, and there is no need for me to say more. I would like to speak on one point of fact. The five members of the Commission of Enquiry have in fact been present at the Council meetings this week. Their presence here is not without cause, and it is not merely to observe or listen, but in fact they have been invited here by the League of Nations and its organs to do useful work. I ask, what other work is there than to help the Council in its deliberations, as you have proposed?"</p>

<p>[Matsuoka:] "I am really unwilling to debate this matter further, but judging from the two matters raised by the Secretary-General, it seems that our views are still being misunderstood. We do not object to the members of the Commission of Enquiry explaining any section of the report to the representatives of the Council, or adding anything to the report, nor have we expressed any opposition. However, we must raise an objection in principle, not in procedure, to the Commission of Enquiry taking the Council's deliberations into account and expressing its opinions on the Council's deliberations, as any expression of opinion by the Council should come entirely from the Council and not from any other organ. We do not object in any way to the Commission of Enquiry explaining or adding to any part of the report, but judging from what you have said, it seems to include what we have been considering here for the past few days, as well as the statement submitted by Japan. This is a matter of principle, and we oppose it. I respectfully request that you give us an opportunity to present our arguments in writing."</p>
<p>(Chairman:) "I think the difficulty of this matter lies only in the form of the question. This matter can be easily resolved once the Chairman of the Commission of Enquiry arrives. Are you satisfied with this, Japanese representative?"</p>
<p>(Matsuoka:) "Yes."</p>
<p>(Chairman:) "I believe that the Council is very willing to receive the written opinion of the Japanese representative, and I personally am very eager to see it first. At the same time, I believe that the members of the Council have no objection to asking the Commission of Enquiry to consider whether there is anything to add to or subtract from its report. (No objections from the members)"</p>

<p>The Chairman said, "I have just received an official letter from the Japanese representative. I will now read its contents to the representatives of the Council.</p>
<p>[Mr. Chairman, In accordance with the understanding reached at the Council meeting yesterday, I have drafted a memorandum on the views of the Japanese delegation regarding the work of the Commission of Enquiry appointed by the Council resolution of December 10, 1931, and its authority at this Council meeting, and submit it herewith for your consideration. Respectfully, Yosuke Matsuoka, Japanese Representative to the Council.</p>
<p>(1) The work of the Commission of Enquiry appointed by the Council on December 10, 1931, is completed from the date the report is submitted to the Council.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese delegation does not object to the members of the Commission of Enquiry now in Geneva, individually or collectively, providing the Council with explanations of the content of the report upon request. The Japanese delegation also does not object to the Commission adding to or subtracting from the report if it deems it necessary. However, it should be made clear that the explanations provided by the Commission should only relate to those sections of the report that are not clear and definitive, and that any additions or subtractions should only be limited to the reconsideration or re-examination of the report itself and the information obtained by the Commission during its on-site investigation, and not to anything else.</p>
<p>(3) Japan cannot recognize the right of the members of the Commission of Enquiry to express opinions or criticisms on the statement submitted by the Japanese government to the Council, or on the statements made by the Japanese representative on the Council floor from the start of the meeting last Monday.</p>
<p>(4) If the Chairman's original proposal, which is to ask the Commission to consider whether to change its opinion in view of the statements made by the Chinese and Japanese sides, is accepted, then the Japanese representative will inevitably have to question the members of the Commission in order to defend the Japanese government to the League of Nations. Once this questioning begins, it will take a very long time. This is what the Japanese representative is most eager to avoid. The Japanese representative's objection to the Chairman's original proposal is for this reason. One]</p>
<p>The Council has read the Japanese representative's official letter. The Chairman then invited Lord Lytton, Chairman of the Commission of Enquiry, to attend and said, "Before I ask the representatives of the Council if they have any questions to ask the members of the Commission of Enquiry, I would like to ask the Chairman of the Commission first if the Commission has anything to add to or subtract from its report."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Lord Lytton's Reply <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Lord Lytton said, "[Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I humbly follow the request of my colleagues and express my gratitude to you and the representatives of China and Japan for your appreciation of our work. If our report can ultimately prove helpful to the League of Nations in considering this extremely complicated and difficult matter, then our efforts will have been well worth it. Other than that, we have nothing else to say.]"</p>

<p>The Chairman said, "[The representatives of the Council have heard the reply of the Chairman of the Commission of Enquiry. Do any of the representatives have any questions to ask the Commission of Enquiry regarding any section of the report? (No one responds) Then none of the representatives of the Council wish to ask any questions of the Commission of Enquiry? (No one responds) In that case, do any of the representatives of the Council wish to discuss the report or raise any points?]"</p>

<p>The Czech representative, Mr. Benes, said, "[Mr. Chairman, I am speaking at this time on the issue before the Council or on the report itself, as I reserved the right to speak and explain my views in the Council when this case was placed on the Council's agenda. However, in recent days, there have been significant developments in this case, and judging from the opinions of some of my colleagues, it seems that the simplest solution to this case would be to submit the entire case to the Assembly for discussion. The Assembly has the right to deal with the entire issue in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant. I believe that you will also make this suggestion, so I will not express my opinion on this case at this time, so as to avoid duplication in the Assembly. However, I will certainly express my opinion when the Assembly meets.]"</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Chairman's Hope for Both Sides <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Chairman said, "[Are there any other representatives of the Council who wish to speak? (No one responds) The representatives of China and Japan have both expressed their opinions on the Lytton Report. Therefore, the question before the Council is whether to further delay the submission of this matter to the Special Assembly, in accordance with the request contained in the Assembly's resolution of March 11. The Council passed a resolution on February 19 to submit this case to the Assembly for handling in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 9 of the Covenant. Therefore, the Assembly has acquired the entire case and has the direct responsibility to seek a solution. I stated at the meeting on September 24 that our transfer of this case to the Assembly does not reduce the Council's freedom to decide whether to discuss this report, as this report is based on another article of the Covenant of the League of Nations. However, I believe that it is entirely in line with the Council's resolution of February 19 to submit this case to the Assembly not to start a comprehensive discussion after hearing the opinions of China and Japan. If we have important and practical considerations that can be grounds for discussing this matter in the Council, then we may as well proceed with the discussion. However, based on the current facts, this practical consideration lies there and not here. Therefore, I believe that we all hope that the Special Assembly can discuss this case at the earliest possible date. The representatives of the Council are also the representatives of the Assembly, so they will have the opportunity to participate in everything in the Assembly in the future and can express their opinions in the organ responsible for resolving this case. I myself also have opinions to express on the report of the Commission of Enquiry, and I firmly believe that the position of the other representatives of the Council is the same as mine. After this case is handed over to the Assembly, we will still have the opportunity to express our opinions, and for the reasons I have stated, it is more appropriate for our opinions to be expressed in the Assembly meeting than in the Council meeting. Moreover, I cannot help but say that when I listened carefully to the speeches of the Chinese and Japanese representatives, I and the other members of the Council paid the most attention to whether there was anything in the words of both sides that could make us believe that there was a satisfactory and swift solution ahead. This case has been delayed for quite some time and should be resolved as soon as possible. However, judging from the speeches of both sides, there is not enough to arouse our optimism. The Japanese government, in its statement, did not express acceptance of the principles of settlement recommended by the Commission, except for the negative phrase "restoring the status quo is not a solution." The Chinese delegation, on the other hand, stated that it reserved the right to present its views on the terms of settlement in the future, and currently only agreed to the third of the ten principles listed in the Commission's report, namely "any settlement should be in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty." Judging from the above, it seems that China and Japan have not yet reached any agreement on what is recommended in the report, which the Council can cite as a basis or recommendation as a practical aid when the Special Assembly decides on a solution. As the Chairman of the Council, I cannot help but express the hope that the opinions expressed by the Chinese and Japanese representatives in the past few days do not represent the final positions of the Chinese and Japanese governments. If a method is provided that offers the possibility of a fair and lasting solution to this tragic dispute, it is hoped that it will not be rejected by either China or Japan. I believe that what I am saying now can not only represent the Council, but also represent the public opinion of the whole world. It should be known that we now have this League of Nations and its organs for the peaceful resolution of disputes such as the one before us, thanks to the fact that world public opinion after the Great War abhorred war. If two member states of the League, as important as China and Japan, once a dispute arises and cannot make full use of the power of the League, or if one of the two parties to the dispute refuses to cooperate, causing the proceedings of the League's organs to be obstructed, then it is tantamount to showing contempt for world public opinion, which is absolutely intolerable. Therefore, I would like to represent the Council in earnestly requesting both representatives, after expressing their opinions, to shift their attention to the practical aspects of this case and to sincerely consider how to assist the League of Nations in seeking a solution."</p>

<p>Li Zongren and Representatives from Various Provinces Attend</p>
<p>Resolutions on Southwest China's National Defense Preparations and Other Issues</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Group, recently came to Guangzhou from Nanning in light of the fall of Yuquan and the increasingly urgent national crisis. He is here to discuss countermeasures with military authorities and Central Committee members from various regions. He arrived in Guangzhou at 10 a.m. on the 11th, accompanied by his wife, Guo Dejie. Those traveling with him included Dan Maoxin, representative from Yunnan Province; Gan Jiayi, special inspector from the Southwest Political Committee in Guizhou Province; Liang Chaoji, adjutant of the Seventh Army in Guangxi Province; and Ma Junwu, President of Guangxi University. According to Li, "This trip to Guangzhou is purely to discuss how to deal with the serious situation in North China with the authorities in Southwest China. All sectors of Guangxi Province are filled with grief and indignation over the loss of Yuquan. Whether to send troops north will be decided after consultation with the Southwest Central Committee members. After recent rectifications in Guangxi, a small portion of the troops have been reduced, and we are now starting to work on construction. The war in Guizhou has been suspended for a long time. Wang Jialie's troops are currently stationed in Rongjiang, and there have been no reports of a counterattack on Guiyang. It seems that the situation in Guizhou can be said to be over for the time being." Li rested briefly at his private residence in Ma Penggang that day. That evening, he had a banquet at Tuisi Garden in Dongshan, where he discussed important public affairs concerning the current situation with Central Committee members from Southwest China. At 3 p.m. on the 12th, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee officially convened a meeting. Li Zongren, Tang Shaoyi, and others attended, and summoned representatives from various provinces. Those present included Dan Maoxin, Zhang Chong, Gan Fengzhang, Zhang Zhen'ou, envoy from Southwest China to Yunnan; Gan Jiayi, envoy from Southwest China to Guizhou; Yang Qiufan, representative from Guizhou; Wang Jianping, representative of Feng Yuxiang; He Minhun, Chairman of the Anti-Japanese Military Commission in Rehe; Jin Zishou and Liu Hanchuan, representatives from Hebei; Dai Jingyuan, representative from Hunan Province; Zhang Mingjiu, representative from Sichuan Province; Zhao Yijian, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army; and Chen Xiaohou, representative. The Southwest Political Affairs Committee members in attendance included Chen Jitang, Zou Lu, Deng Zheru, Liu Luyin, Liu Jiwen, Lin Yun, Chen Rong, Zhang Renmin, Li Xiangen, and Yang Xiji. At 3:30 p.m.,</p>
<p>the meeting began to discuss various issues. Representatives from all parties presented their opinions and reported on the recent situation in their respective areas. Apart from important matters that were inconvenient to disclose, Chen Jitang and Zou Lu later raised the issue of Southwest China's national defense preparations. The representatives had mutual discussions and resolved: (1) To adhere to the principle of resisting Japan and saving the nation, and to carry out everything in accordance with the telegram issued by the Political Affairs Committee on the fish day. (2) To urge the Central Government to implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, to be determined to resist Japan,</p>
<p>to send troops to kill the enemy and recover the lost territories as soon as possible. (3) To strengthen the deployment of national defense in Southwest China by various provinces. (4) To resolve to provide long-term assistance to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. On that day, there were also discussions on the construction of the Qin-Yu Five-Province Railway and the economic construction of Southwest China, but no results were reached. The meeting adjourned at around 4 p.m. (January 13th)</p>
<p>Shandong Assists Central Government's Military Expenses Case</p>
<h3 id="e110">Wang Xiangrong to Report on Financial Situation in Beijing <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: When Liu Zhennian's troops were stationed in Shandong, the provincial government was responsible for a portion of the military pay for that division. Since that division was transferred to Zhejiang and Fujian, Shandong's assistance with military pay naturally ceased. Recently, the central government reached an agreement with the Shandong provincial government that, due to the central government's financial difficulties, the Shandong provincial government would assist the central government with 100,000 yuan per month. This has been approved by the provincial government and implemented starting in February. However, Shandong is impoverished and local finances are insufficient. In the future, regarding the matter of assisting the central government with 100,000 yuan, it may be necessary to find other ways to handle it. Therefore, Wang Xiangrong, the Director of the Department of Finance, needs to discuss solutions with the central government regarding this issue and report the general situation of local revenue and expenditure in Shandong to Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Finance. He left for Beijing by the Jinpu train this morning (the 17th). According to Wang's remarks before his departure, "I have repeatedly received telegrams from Chairman Chiang summoning me to Beijing to inquire about the financial situation in Shandong, and I am also eager to take this opportunity to report the revenue and expenditure of the province to the Ministry of Finance. I will stay in Beijing for about a week before returning to Jinan. Regarding the central government's order for Shandong to assist with military expenses of 100,000 yuan per month, it is appropriate for Shandong to assist the central government if Shandong's finances are sufficient. However, the province's finances are also very difficult, and it will be necessary to find other ways to accomplish this in the future. Last year, the local revenue and expenditure of this province were both more than 25 million yuan. Due to excessive military expenses, there was inevitably a slight deficit. After the transfer of Liu Zhennian's troops, the more than ten counties in Jiaodong returned to the jurisdiction of the provincial government. It is expected that revenue may increase, but these counties have been devastated and their vitality has not recovered. They are requesting exemptions from surcharges and all supplementary levies. It is still uncertain whether there will be an increase in revenue in the future." (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Songhang Case Reopens for Debate <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Still No Result, Debate Scheduled to Continue</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: The Songhang arrears case was previously debated to a conclusion by the county court on December 6th of last year, with a scheduled pronouncement on the 12th. The civil court announced that the plaintiff requested to withdraw the lawsuit against defendants Gu Jiaxuan and Zhu Hesun, and the remaining cases were regarded as withdrawn with the plaintiff bearing the litigation costs. Afterwards, the creditors immediately applied for an interpretation. On December 26th, after the court served the ruling, the creditors immediately filed an appeal. The court then revoked the original ruling and scheduled a reopening of the debate at 2 PM on the 18th of this month, as previously reported. Yesterday marked the date of the reopened debate. On the plaintiff's side, the creditor representative Bai Guanlan and the proxy lawyers Qu and Liu Zhimou arrived. On the defendant's side, only the proxy lawyer Sha Xunyi and the special proxy Tang Mingshi arrived. President Wang, accompanied by Secretary Li, presided over the hearing. First, they questioned creditor representative Bai Guanlan about the purpose of reopening the debate, and then asked whether the target of the lawsuit was the board of directors or the shareholders. Bai then stated the reasons for withdrawing the case against the two households. President Wang suddenly sternly questioned, "The target of the lawsuit must be clarified before the lawyers of both parties can debate." He further inquired about the amount of Bai Guanlan's claim, to which he replied 700 yuan, deposited in the name of the real estate company. The judge asked, "What is your position in the real estate company?" He replied, "Manager." The judge then said, "This proof is necessary. Although there was an agreement to organize the real estate company at that time, it was not yet established, and the account was only in an individual name." The lawyer then said, "The creditor representative, Bai Guanlan, also registered the debt with the liquidator and has appeared in court several times, so there should be no doubt. Today, the court is hearing this case, and the situation is lively, but our proxy still asks the court to conduct the hearing with the same calm and impartiality as before. The interested parties should state the facts, and the law should supplement them. The court can direct the process regarding the litigation qualification at any time. In short, the opposing proxy will do everything possible to seek a quick resolution to this case." The judge then said, "There are two points to be addressed before reopening the debate in this case: 1) Creditor representative Bai Guanlan must supplement the procedures for his position as manager of the Songjiang Real Estate Company; 2) Is the lawsuit against the board of directors or the shareholders?" Lawyer Qu then said, "The first point can be supplemented according to the law. As for the second point, the board of directors, supervisors, etc. should bear joint liability. The creditors filed an appeal, which has led to the reopening of the debate. According to Article 475 of the Civil Procedure Law, if the appeal is deemed reasonable, the original court can correct the original ruling; otherwise, your court should have transferred the case to the appellate court for handling earlier. Furthermore, your court can refer to the first half of the prosecutor's office's decision of non-prosecution of Zhang Xiaomei et al., which is not much different." Then, after hearing the arguments of both parties, the court ordered a continuation of the debate at a scheduled time and adjourned.</p>

<p>Due to the Scarcity of Rainfall Last Year, the River Water Became Shallow and Dried Up After Winter, Making Ship Navigation Extremely Difficult. Heavily Loaded Vessels Almost Couldn't Navigate. The County Government Decided to Take Advantage of This Period to Implement River Dredging. Yesterday, a River Dredging Committee Meeting Was Specially Held with the County Construction Bureau, the County and City Financial Property Office, and the District Chiefs of the Seventeen Districts. The Following Was Decided: 1) Dredge the Original Surveyed Shuang River, Nanxing Pond River, Zhihu Port, Ma Jiagang, Ling, Hibiscus Pond Great River, Zhihu Port, and Ma Gang Ports. The Total Cost of Building Materials Is 5,500 Silver Dollars. In Addition to the 1,500 Silver Dollars Collected by the Construction Bureau in January, the Remaining 4,000 Silver Dollars Will Be Borne by the Construction Bureau as Future Water Conservancy Expenses. 2) The Construction Bureau Should First Survey and Estimate the Expenses for Dredging the North-South Trunk Rivers in the Urban Area, and Then Let the Local Fund-Raising Method Be Used to Implement Dredging. Furthermore, the North Great Bridge River (i.e., Lotus Rong Bridge), Which Is an Important Route for the Suzhou-Changzhou Canal, Is Also Severely Silted. The Two Towns of Beitang and Daqiao Decided to Dredge It, and the County Construction Bureau Estimated That the Project Would Require 5,600 Silver Dollars. A Meeting Was Held with Various Industries at the County Chamber of Commerce Yesterday, and the Following Was Decided: 1) Immediately Submit a Request to the County Government to Issue a Notice to Inform All Canal Shipping Households to Pay Attention to Ship Navigation and to Announce It in the Newspaper; 2) Organize a River Dredging Engineering Committee, Appointing Xiao Jian, Director of the Bureau, District Chief Qian, Zhao Zixin, Miao Lianchen, Yang Hanxi, Cai Jian, Qian Sunqing, Chen Zhanru, Tao Yinful, Feng Yunxiang, Jiang Huanqing, Qian Weiqing, Xue Mingjian, Qin Xiangtao, and Zou Songfan as Committee Members; 3) The County Chamber of Commerce Should Invite Various Industries to Raise Donations; 4) The Rice and Bean South Goods Industries Should Each Fill Out a Check for 500 Silver Dollars; 5) It Was Decided That the Dam Would Be Built and Dredging Would Begin on the 26th of This Month, Which Is the First Day of the Lunar New Year, with a Deadline of One and a Half Months for Completion. Furthermore, the River Channels in the Qianqiao Area of the Fourth District of the County Are Important Routes for Yixing Transport and Are the Lifeline for Irrigation in Kaiyuan and Fuan Townships. District Chief Zhu Has Completed the Survey, and It Has Been Decided to Use the Construction Bureau to Begin Dredging Immediately.</p>

Craftsmen are repairing them overnight, and telephone service in the city was restored this morning. Due to the clearing of snow, the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou buses only resumed normal service on the afternoon of the 18th. The long-distance buses on the Jiangsu-Jurong road only made one round trip yesterday. The Beijing-Shanghai trains, both northbound and southbound, were delayed due to insufficient heating in the cold weather. Canal boats have been suspended for several days due to ice.</p>

<p>In Recent Years, Robberies of Small Steamships on the Yangtze River and Inland Rivers Have Been Heard of From Time to Time. Sometimes Bandits Are Discovered on Board in the Middle of the Journey, or Bandits Suddenly Board Ships in Remote Places to Rob. The Reason for This Is That Passengers on Small Steamships Are Not Strictly Checked When Boarding and Alighting, Which Allows Bandits to Sneak In and Repeatedly Commit Robberies. In Order to Punish and Prevent Such Incidents, the Jiangsu Provincial Government Has Instructed the Local Public Security Bureaus and Security Teams to Conscientiously Conduct Inspections. On the One Hand, Armed Police Officers Should Be Stationed on Each Small Steamship to Protect the Ship, So That Criminals Cannot Sneak In and the Public Order of Water Traffic Can Be Ensured. The Provincial Government Yesterday Ordered the Security Department to Take Measures to Maintain Order So That Travelers Can Be Safe. At the Same Time, It Will Consult with the Department of Civil Affairs to Draft Measures and Order the Implementation and Report for Filing. Tongchonghaiqi Military and Police Escort</p>

However, How Should the Duties Be Assigned to the Military and Police Along the Way, What Responsibilities Should Be Defined, and How Should the Prevention of Inspection Disputes and the Dispatch of Escort Military and Police Be Managed and Replaced? All of This Should Be Detailed in the Measures for Compliance. As for the Fundraising Expenses Mentioned in the Original Letter from the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, What Is the Situation? The Report Did Not Clearly State This. How Should This Expense Be Raised? A Budget Should Be Drafted and Reported in Detail Along with the Established Measures, and the Inspection and Detective Measures Discussed by the Water Police District Department Should Be Investigated and Reported Together for Review and Compliance. Representatives of the Four Counties Are Scheduled to Meet in Nantong Again on the 20th to Carefully Determine and Implement Detailed Measures.</p>

<p>Reporting on Ma Zhanshan's Journey into Russia</p>
<p>And the Arrival of the Heilongjiang Army on the Border of Jehol</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Wu Huanzhang, representative of General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and Jiang Songnian, Counselor of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, hosted a press conference at Zhongshe on Weihaiwei Road at 3 PM yesterday. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Wu Huanzhang first reported on General Ma Zhanshan's retreat into Russia and the date of his return to China, followed by Jiang Songnian's report on the Heilongjiang Army's arduous battles and their detour to Jehol. The meeting adjourned at about 5 PM. The reports of Wu and Jiang are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Wu Huanzhang's Report <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>I am very honored and fortunate that you, comrades of the press, have graced us with your guidance today. I will briefly report to you on Chairman Ma Zhanshan's journey into Russia, the date of his return to China, and the arrival of the Heilongjiang Army on the border of Jehol.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Journey into Russia and Date of Return <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received a telegram from Wan Fulin of the Beiping Branch of the Military Commission, relaying Chairman Ma Zhanshan's telegram stating that after issuing the general attack order in October of last year, he besieged the enemy for more than a month in Laha Station, Taian Town, Keshan, and other places. However, due to exhaustion of ammunition and supplies and the arrival of enemy reinforcements, as well as the assistance of Mongolian bandits, our army suffered heavy losses. In order to preserve strength, he ordered the troops on the Qikehu-Hai lines to march west, hoping to establish contact with the Su (Bingwen) army. When they reached Yalu County, they were attacked by the Japanese army attacking Su. He had no choice but to order Bu Binshan, Deng Wen, Tan Zixin, Li Zhongyi, and others to lead their troops west, taking the Solun Mountain in Mongolia towards Jehol, in order to obtain supplies. Chairman Ma personally took the European route, intending to report the atrocities of the violent Japan to the League of Nations. Recently, I received confirmation that the central government has remitted the funds needed by Chairman Ma and Commander Su. Both Ma and Su were extremely indignant at the depth of the enemy's invasion in North China and have submitted a written report to the League of Nations. The trip to Geneva has been canceled, and they are planning to return to China. Chairman Ma, because his troops have arrived on the border of Jehol, will first return to China by a roundabout route to lead his troops and continue to resist Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Situation of the Heilongjiang Army Arriving on the Border of Jehol <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The various anti-Japanese armies of Heilongjiang Province, led by Commander Deng, Deputy Commander Tan, and Commander Shao, numbered about 15,000 when they arrived on the border of Jehol. Those led by Commander Li Zhongyi numbered about 27,000. In total, the troops that arrived numbered about 40,000. Under the supervision of Chairman Ma, these troops first raised the banner of anti-Japanese resistance, fought bloody battles, and struggled for years. Due to exhaustion of ammunition and clothing, they detoured to Jehol, suffering from hunger and cold, and enduring great hardship. Yesterday, Commander Deng sent a telegram to Mr. Li Mingxin stating that they had no way to raise funds for Ma's team's expenses or to send telegrams. The difficulty of their situation can be seen. These troops have a considerable history of anti-Japanese warfare and have sacrificed a lot of courage. Now that they have come to Jehol due to unavoidable circumstances, we must provide them with adequate supplies as soon as possible so that they can return to Heilongjiang and continue to resist Japan. There are still more than 40,000 troops lurking in various places in Heilongjiang. They will surely follow suit if they see that those who have gone to Jehol have no return date. If so, then Japan will be able to clear all of our border volunteer armies in Heilongjiang Province without spending a single soldier or arrow. This will have a great impact on our country's entire plan to recover lost territory. Moreover, violent Japan's invasion of North China is urgent, and Jehol's safety is precarious. In order to draw firewood from under the cauldron and slow down the enemy's advance, these incoming troops should be actively supplied. In order to allow these troops to join the fighting in Jehol, they should also be actively supplied. In short, with the loss of the Northeast and the instability of North China, the survival of the Chinese nation depends entirely on the result of a desperate fight. Although the Heilongjiang army has failed to achieve its goal of defending the territory, its years of arduous fighting are enough to demonstrate the spirit of our nation. Therefore, supplying these troops will be more effective than regrouping newly formed troops.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Thanking the Press <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Since Heilongjiang Province first raised the banner of anti-Japanese resistance, the comrades in the Shanghai press have promoted it in many ways, giving Heilongjiang unlimited assistance. Chairman Ma and all the officers and soldiers are extremely grateful. However, the country is in trouble, and we still rely on you, gentlemen, to vigorously promote it so that we can get adequate supplies and complete our unfinished work. It would be fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Jiang Songnian's Report <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Huanzhang has already reported in detail on the purpose of inviting you today. I accompanied Chairman Ma in the war against Japan for half a year, so I know the actual situation of the war in more detail. Therefore, I will report on it. After the violent Japan expanded the incident in the Northeast, the three provinces were lost, and the people of the three provinces lost their support. Chairman Ma took the lead in raising the banner of righteousness to fulfill his duty. At that time, the army carried radios to communicate with various places and report on the war situation at any time. The comrades in the press revealed and promoted it in detail, so that the officers and soldiers fighting hard outside the customs received a lot of spiritual comfort and material assistance, which is very admirable. Later, because the motor was heavy and the rain caused water to accumulate, making it very difficult to transport across the rivers, the machine industry was placed in the mountains. Afterwards, news from the front was cut off, causing the people of the country to be ignorant and leading to rumors of Chairman Ma's hatred. Now, I will report on the situation after the information was cut off as follows:</p>

<p>Greetings, I have had fruitful discussions with Mr. Sheng Shan in recent days. Our department has long been determined to resist Japan. We are grateful for your concern about our material shortages. As soldiers, it is our duty to defend the country. How could we trouble the people? We deeply hope for unity between the military and the people to jointly resist the enemy. I earnestly pray for this. Special telegram in reply. He Zhuguo Xian Secret.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Telegram</p>
<p>To: All Organizations of the National Salvation Joint Association of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Your telegram has been received and read. The neighboring country is powerful and aggressive, with no end in sight. Every inch of our national territory is vital. It is our duty to bear arms, and our determination has long been made. We are deeply grateful for your encouragement and support. With patriotic zeal, we are deeply moved. Currently, the situation in the Yuguan area is one of stalemate. The morale of our troops is high, and we vow to fight to the end. We hope for timely guidance and assistance at any time to facilitate our operations and save the dire situation. We earnestly pray. Special reply. Zhang Xueliang Zhen.</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong's Telegram</p>
<p>To: All Gentlemen of the National Salvation Joint Association of Various Organizations, No. 14 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Your telegram has been received and read. Your wise words are deeply appreciated. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have been tyrannical and aggressive, with no end in sight. Three provinces have already fallen, and alarming news has come from Yu and Rehe. Xuezhong has a responsibility to defend the territory and shares the same animosity towards the enemy. I vow to strictly discipline my troops to defend our borders. I am grateful for your clear instruction and express my sincere sentiments. Yu Xuezhong Qin Seal.</p>
<p>Moreover, one party sent Yu south to report everything. When Chairman Ma was about to leave, he said to Yu, "I have two paths ahead: to die resisting Japan or to live resisting Japan." Although Chairman Ma is currently abroad, he will soon return to the country to raise the banner of righteousness again and vow to resist Japan to the death. I am very grateful for your previous efforts in promoting the cause of the anti-Japanese army. I hope you will continue to assist as much as possible. The survival of the Chinese nation rests on this one effort.</p>
<p>News of Ma's Death from a Certain Source</p>
<p>Chairman Ma encountered three thousand enemy soldiers on his way to meet Generals Ding and Li. After a day of fierce fighting, he finally broke through. During this battle, one of Chairman Ma's guards died. This guard wore a Wenhu Medal, which he had received from the chief guard of General Su Bingwen. Initially, when Generals Su and Ma met, General Su's chief guard gave a Wenhu Medal to Chairman Ma's chief guard. After playing with it for a long time, Chairman Ma's chief guard gave it to a guard. This guard then wore the Wenhu Medal on his body and died with it. However, the source of this Wenhu Medal is unknown. Later, the enemy inspected the corpses and suddenly found a body wearing a Wenhu Medal. They were overjoyed, believing that anyone wearing a Wenhu Medal must be a lieutenant general or higher, and the body's height was similar to Chairman Ma's. They mistakenly believed that Chairman Ma was dead. The enemy forces in Heilongjiang Province celebrated for three days and reported it to the Japanese Emperor. However, it has now been proven that Chairman Ma is still alive. Nevertheless, Japanese and puppet newspapers still refer to Chairman Ma as "Second Ma Zhanshan" and "Puppet Ma Zhanshan," etc., because the news has already been reported to the Japanese Emperor.</p>
<p>Telegrams from Wang Delin and Others</p>
<p>Cut off the enemy's advance on all routes from Jilin to Dunhua and Jihui.</p>
<p>Even with one bullet and one man, we will fight to the end.</p>
<p>We still hope for government troops and assistance from compatriots nationwide.</p>
<p>General Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, and all 43 generals including Kong Xianrong, sent a telegram to the nation on the 12th, vowing to fight to the end, hoping for government troops and urgent assistance from compatriots. Every word is tearful and extremely painful. The original telegram was released yesterday by the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army Joint Liaison Office in Shanghai, as follows: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Chairman Chiang, Beiping Chairman Zhang, all ministries and departments, all provincial and municipal party headquarters, all provincial and municipal governments, all charitable organizations, all military units, all newspapers, and all envoys to China. Since the September 18th Incident, the brutal Japanese have invaded and occupied our land, slaughtered our people, seized political power, and established a puppet state, resorting to all kinds of atrocities. Subsequently, they bombed Shanghai and Tianjin, and their iron hooves have swept across the Northeast. Fortunately, friendly forces have risen up like a storm, vowing to turn the tide, and it has been more than a year. The enemy has not yet fulfilled their beastly desires. Our army has fought hundreds of battles, desperately holding on to a corner, with few bullets and little clothing, enduring ice and snow. This is our duty, and we dare not claim merit. However, from the beginning of his campaign, Delin took it as his responsibility to cut off the enemy's railways from Jilin to Dunhua and Jihui, destroying those already completed and preventing those not yet completed from being built. This is a crucial strategy to prevent the enemy from deploying troops and transporting weapons. To this day, we continue to destroy and rebuild, and any conspiracies and schemes are hindered by transportation obstacles. The impact of this is known to the world. However, because of this restriction and harassment, the enemy is determined to annihilate our army, and they think of this day and night. Delin's ambition is to save the country, and he has no concerns. As long as there is a breath left, this plan will never be relaxed. However, when will the broken land be recovered? Hoping for fair mediation from the League of Nations is like looking at plums to quench thirst, and waiting for a national mobilization is like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. It is heartbreaking and deeply worrying. Generals Ma and Su have already painfully led their troops into Russia, and Commanders Ding and Li have been forced to gradually retreat north. All of them are well-trained troops with strategic experience and numbers that are superior to our army, yet they have been forced to retreat temporarily due to a lack of ammunition, resulting in unnecessary sacrifices. The facts are there, and even in defeat, they are glorious. We have lost contact, and the oppressive situation of the brutal Japanese is becoming increasingly tight. In recent days, there have been fierce battles in Ning'an, Muling, Mudanjiang, Suifenhe, and along the Jilin-Dunhua railway. Fortunately, our soldiers are fighting bravely, and although the enemy is attacking from above and below with aircraft and heavy artillery, we are relying on the terrain to strike at their weaknesses, and we have not been defeated. Even though there is no medical care for the wounded and dead, the unity and solidarity of our spirit is being forged in day and night battles. Delin has dedicated himself to the Party and the country and is determined to die. He deeply understands that the lack of supplies and ammunition is the most significant suffering. Therefore, he sent Liang Juntang to Guannei as his plenipotentiary representative to appeal to the central authorities, charitable organizations, and overseas Chinese for assistance. To this day, although we have received patriotic support from all sides and have been working hard to provide relief, the funds received are still a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. Delin is currently in a state of isolation and helplessness. I dare to solemnly declare again that even if we fight to the last bullet and the last man, we will fight to the death with the Japanese invaders. We know that under an overturned nest, there can be no intact eggs. However, a common man cannot be deprived of his ambition. We are unwilling to surrender to the enemy and live a life of shame, nor do we want to enter Russia and take a detour.</p>
<p>Japanese Trade with China Last Year</p>
<p>Except for North China, it has decreased overall.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office received a telegram from Tokyo on January 18 stating that the total value of Japan's domestic and overseas trade in 1932 was 2,980,000,000 yen, of which exports accounted for only 1,457,000,000 yen, resulting in a surplus of 66,000,000 yen. Compared to the previous year, the total value of foreign trade increased by 20%, exports increased by 24%, imports increased by 15%, and the surplus decreased by 50%. The increase in imports was mainly due to cotton, wool, iron, machinery, kerosene, wheat, and other raw materials. Importers anticipated that prices would rise due to increased import taxes and inflation, leading to competitive imports. As for export trade, it was very active in all regions except China and the United States. Cotton cloth, silk, socks, porcelain, etc., were very popular in India, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, Aden, Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and South America due to the low exchange rate of the Japanese currency. There was also a great demand for cotton cloth, flour, machinery, sugar, and other groceries in Manchuria. As for trade with China, the total value of exports for the year was 147,000,000 yen, resulting in a surplus of 69,000,000 yen. Compared to the previous year, exports to North China increased by 46% (almost half), while exports to Central China decreased by 39%, exports to South China decreased by 92%, and exports to Hong Kong decreased by 59%. Conversely, imports from China to Japan decreased by 18% from North China, 32% from Central China, 28% from South China, and 95% from Hong Kong. In Manchuria, the total value of exports for the year was 146,000,000 yen, resulting in a surplus of 18,000,000 yen, with exports increasing by 89% and imports decreasing by 2% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The Rumor of the Turpan Rebellion is Inaccurate</p>
<p>Turkish Press Telegram to Shanghai Muslims</p>
<p>The Rumor Was Fabricated by an Istanbul Correspondent</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the rumor of a rebellion in Turpan, Xinjiang, and the intention to establish a buffer state between China and Russia similar to the puppet state of Manchuria, which was transmitted by a Russian telegram from Istanbul, Turkey, has already been denied by influential Muslims in Shanghai. It is further heard that the Muslim community has now received a reply telegram from the Istanbul press, stating that the Turkish society does not pay attention to this news. Only a few days ago, a Turkish newspaper published a similar piece of news, which was said to have been sent by an Oriental correspondent stationed in Turkey. Therefore, the previous unfounded rumor has been clarified, and the intention of the rumor-monger is known.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether rear support is timely, we will resist for a long time in the White Mountains and Black Waters with our 70,000 loyal and brave soldiers. We hope to cooperate with the national army in a joint expedition to capture the Yellow Dragon. Our strategy may change, but our will will never waver. Finally, we still hope that the government will send troops for assistance, and that our compatriots will pay special attention and strive to find solutions. We eagerly await your help. We express our plea with tears in our eyes, hoping for your understanding. General Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army, along with Vice Commander and Brigade Commander, Central Route Commander Kong Rong, Left Route Commander and Brigade Commander Wang Yuzhen, Right Route Commander and Brigade Commander Wu Yichen, Brigade Commanders Chen Yuqing, Zhang Peng, Yang Xisan, Li Zhaodong, Chen Wanlin, Cheng Haifeng, Pacification Commander Yu Xuanrui,督战Commander Zhang Yuting, Regiment Commanders Zheng Xing, Li Yanlu, Jiang Bingshan, Ma Haishan, Zhang Xiangyun, Meng Xianshu, Chen Deshun, Sun Baokun, Liu Jingchen, Wen Mingshan, Gong Yinqing, Zu Yaozhong, Wang Kaichen, Yao Shuyun, Liu Shikai, Zou Jingfu, Sun Hongen, Zhou Donghua, Du Liansheng, Mu Xingyun, Chai Shirong, Wu Hanchen, Yu Fenggang, Shi Xiaodong, Yao Zhenshan, Shan Bingjun, Wei Zhenshan, Liang Dengcheng, Sun Dengshan, Yang Deshan, Ai Lantai, Yin Yongnian, etc., respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Major Layoffs</p>
<p>More Than One Hundred Laid-Off Workers at Five Wharves Petition Yesterday</p>
<p>Since Liu Hongsheng took over as general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has been trying to reorganize the company. One hundred and six redundant employees in the head office have been laid off. A notice was issued the day before yesterday to lay off 117 employees at the five wharves. The union held a general meeting yesterday, and the entire body petitioned the board of directors in the afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Layoffs</p>
<p>The board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company announced the day before yesterday that 117 employees at the five wharves would be laid off. The original letter is as follows: "To whom it may concern: By order of the general manager, the company's finances are strained. The employees in question should be immediately suspended from their duties, etc. This is to inform you to check and hand over all matters in your charge, and then collect your severance pay." The severance pay method is calculated based on the number of years of service: one month's salary for those with less than one year of service, and two months' salary for those with one year or more of service. All those who are not laid off will also be notified by letter.</p>
<p>Union Meeting</p>
<p>After receiving reports from the heads of the various groups at the five wharves, the union immediately registered the laid-off employees. There were 12 laid-off employees from the North Wharf, 36 from the China Wharf, 13 from the Central Wharf, 17 from the South Wharf, and 23 from the New Wharf, totaling 101 people. The remaining 16 people were not registered. An emergency meeting was immediately convened at 10:00 AM yesterday. It was resolved that the layoffs were unfair. It was resolved to 1) nominate Fu Ziyang (China Wharf), Chen Shifu (South Wharf), Chen Mei (New Wharf), Li Angqing (North Wharf), Shan Xishou (South Wharf), and Jiang Yinkui (North Wharf) to petition the board of directors and demand the recall of the order; 2) issue a declaration requesting assistance from the party and government organs.</p>
<p>Collective Petition</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM yesterday, the union of the five wharves sent Fu Ziyang, Chen Shifu, Chen Mei, and others to lead all the laid-off employees to the board of directors of the head office to petition and demand the recall of the order. The board of directors was holding its tenth regular meeting. After the meeting adjourned, Du Yuesheng, a standing director, met with them. The union representatives first stated the unfairness of the layoffs. Du Yuesheng then ordered the union to submit detailed reasons and malpractices of each wharf to the board of directors, which would then review and remedy the situation. The entire body of employees was satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>General Manager's Statement</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She met with General Manager Liu Hongsheng last night. According to him, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has too much debt. The total annual turnover is only more than 5 million yuan, but the salaries of employees are very high and there are many redundant employees. The financial situation is strained, and it is necessary to lay off employees at the five wharves. The results of the inspections by the heads of the various departments and the review by the board of directors were approved. In addition to paying severance pay to the laid-off employees in accordance with the regulations, the wages for December and double pay will be paid in full.</p>
<p>Dismissal of Third Mates</p>
<p>The second layoff of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was carried out yesterday. In addition to one month's salary, each laid-off person will receive one month's severance pay. Yesterday, the ship captains were notified to go to the company to collect the money on their behalf, and the laid-off employees were ordered to leave the ships immediately.</p>
<p>Page 10</p>
<p>The company order is recorded as follows: To the order of compliance, in the case of the first class of driving students from the former Navigation School, who graduated in June last year, all of them were used as alternate third mates, but the company's ships are too small, and there is no need for third mates. After selecting the best of the students to act as alternate second mates for four of them, the rest were still assigned to the ships for internship. This has been extended for a long time, which has not only hindered the students' future, but also prevented other nautical students from having equal opportunities to practice. It is not appropriate for both of them. The Ministry of Communications has repeatedly ordered the students of the Wusong Merchant Marine School's driving class to be assigned to various ships for practice, and the board of directors has considered the sticky fruit and agreed that the equal practice and macro-creation should be the proper way. The alternate third mates should be dismissed, and the allowance should be stopped by the end of this month. In the future, if there is a vacancy in the company's ships, the best of them should still be given priority. The number of people to be dismissed is attached to the back, and the captains of each ship are instructed to comply. Sincerely, this order. It is planned to dismiss ten alternate third mates: Chen Shuding (Jianghua), Teng Jiufan (Jiangxin), Zhou Hongyin (Jiangxin), You Junyuan (Jiangda), Xiao Jinan (Gongping), Lu Yuexue (Gongping), Tu Fang (Guangli), He Tong (Guonan), Xu Guangshi (Yushun), Gao Fakang (Jiahe). Two students from the first class of the Navigation School who failed the graduation exam will be dismissed: Luo Jiayou (Jianguo) and Qiu Kai (Guangli).</p>
<p>French Concession Taxpayers Association Opposes Water and Electricity Price Increases</p>
<p>Westerners Request Chinese Directors to Strictly Reject</p>
<p>The French Concession Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Chinese directors of the French Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, according to letters from citizens Zhang Zhongfang, Lu Guisheng, etc., it has recently been heard that the French-owned water and electricity company in the French Concession is considering increasing the price of water and electricity, and a proposal may soon be submitted for the French Municipal Council to review and approve. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the market has been depressed, and the people's livelihood has been declining. The situation of recession is becoming increasingly obvious. Even taking measures to provide relief is not enough. Now the company, as a local public utility operated exclusively, disregards the people's livelihood and suddenly wants to increase the burden on residents. The citizens vow not to recognize this. Please forward this to the Chinese directors attending the French Municipal Council and do not accept the proposal for the benefit of the people. The water and electricity are public utilities that are closely related to the daily needs of the people. They cannot be regarded as a source of profit, only to seek business gains. Judging from the original water and electricity prices set by the French company, they are already expensive compared to the Public Concession. At that time, it may have been the initial stage, and there were few users. For the sake of maintaining the blood capital, it was not too harsh. Now, the concession is prosperous, and the residents are close together. The company's business is developed, and the profits are already considerable. Yet, it is still not satisfied and wants to increase the price, which violates the purpose of public utilities, and the local residents cannot recognize this. In accordance with the foregoing, this is to inform you that if the French water and electricity company requests the Municipal Council to increase the price, please strictly reject it and do not allow it to pass in order to benefit the people's livelihood and maintain public welfare. It is for the public good."</p>
<p>Initiating the First Anniversary of the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>The Lawyers Association Sent a Letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association</p>
<p>For the first anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War, a special meeting of all members will be held at 2:00 PM this afternoon at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association on Xizang Road in the Public Concession to commemorate the pain.

<p>Pirates Hijack the Dahua Steamer Outside Wusongkou</p>
<p>The Pirates Infiltrated from Shanghai</p>
<p>Robbery of New Banknotes from Farmers and Workers</p>
<p>Losses Exceeded 30,000 Gold</p>
<p>Fortunately, Passengers Were Safe</p>
<p>In recent times, merchant ships along the coast of Zhejiang have been repeatedly hijacked by pirates. First, there was the Yongchuan, then the Xinningtai, and now the Shanghai-Zhoushan steamer Dahua has suffered a significant loss. The details of the investigation obtained by the reporter of this newspaper are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cause of the Hijacking</p>
<p>It is recalled that two months ago, the Customs received a confidential report stating that dozens of pirates from Dapeng Bay had set off for the coast of Zhejiang, intending to loot merchant ships. The confidential order required all shipping companies to pay attention. This matter was recorded in this newspaper, but after a long time, the shipping industry no longer remembers. However, these pirates have been hiding in Shanghai, specializing in investigating ships carrying large sums of money in order to carry out robberies. This time, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank issued new banknotes, and a batch of them was transported to Zhoushan on the Dahua. The bandits discovered this, so they gathered people to board the ship and carry out the robbery.</p>
<p>Disguised as Passengers</p>
<p>The Dahua Steamer of the Ping An Company, which runs between Shanghai and Zhoushan, is assigned to the Lian'an Shipping Bureau. It departed from Nanshi, Shanghai, at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month. There were more than 400 passengers on board, and the 15 pirates boarded the ship in Shanghai as passengers. Weapons such as pistols were carried in luggage and other items. When the ship set sail, the 15 pirates were scattered in various cabins, waiting for the ship to reach Wusongkou to carry out the robbery.</p>
<p>Details of the Robbery</p>
<p>At 7:40 PM on the 17th, the ship sailed to the area between the No. 1 river cylinder and the No. 2 river brief outside Wusongkou. At that time, the passengers had finished their dinner and were preparing to sleep. Among the 15 pirates, four of them sneaked out of the cabin, fired a shot into the sky, and rushed into the captain's room. The captain, Ge, and all the crew members were guarded and imprisoned in one room. Then, they began to loot, first robbing the accounting room, taking more than 500 yuan in silver dollars and more than 100 yuan in small coins that had been sold. Four female students from a school in Hangzhou were robbed of more than 2,000 yuan in silver dollars. The abbot of Baoben Temple in Mount Putuo, Ying Zhao, was robbed of 350 yuan in paper money and silver dollars. Because he refused to be searched, he was beaten and eventually robbed.</p>
<p>Robbery of New Banknotes</p>
<p>The bandits' purpose was the large sum of new banknotes from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, totaling 20,000 yuan. They were shipped from Shanghai to the Zhoushan branch and stored in the silver cabin. The bandits forced the accountant to open the silver cabin and took all 20,000 yuan in new banknotes. At that time, the sky was slightly bright. Some of the pirates who were familiar with driving skills drove the Dahua to the Huanglong Jiao Reef outside Sanjiashui, Wusong, preparing to escape.</p>
<p>Looting and Fleeing Far Away</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Dahua arrived at Huanglong Jiao Reef and immediately stopped. The stolen silver and other items were packed into several bags, and the captain, Ge, and the passenger Hong were forced to board two small boats to transport the bandits to the small island of Jiao Reef. Fearing that something might happen, they also ordered the captain to send the bandits to the island. The captain and others had no choice but to obey. When the bandits left, they fired several shots (pistols) on the edge of the small island. The bandits had a small boat waiting for them, so they were able to escape safely.</p>
<p>Telegram to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Dahua Steamer is only 600 tons and has no radio equipment, so it was unable to report the robbery. After the bandits fled, the captain returned to the ship, released the crew members, and rushed to Dinghai. It was afternoon when they arrived in Dinghai, and the captain sent a telegram to Shanghai, reporting to the Lian'an Shipping Bureau that the Dahua had been robbed at Songkou, that the passengers were safe, and that they had arrived in Dinghai. The telegram arrived in Shanghai on the night of the 18th. It is estimated that the ship will arrive at Haimen yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter went to the Lian'an Shipping Bureau. According to Director Dong, the Shanghai Bureau had sent a telegram to Haimen, ordering the Dahua to return to Shanghai as soon as possible to investigate the truth. In total, the public and private losses from this robbery are estimated to be more than 10,000 yuan. Fortunately, no passengers or crew members were injured.</p>
<p>Former Contractor of Tea and Snacks on Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Trains Causes Disturbance at the North Station Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at 9:00 AM yesterday, a man claiming to be Sun Wenpin, the manager of the tea and snack contract for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo passenger trains, and dozens of workers and their families broke into the office of the director of the train affairs department, demanding the cancellation of the bidding for the tea and snack contract for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. They claimed that Sun Wenpin's contract was not due to expire until the end of July, and that 3,000 yuan had been deposited as proof. Zheng Baozhao, the director of the train affairs department, and Yuan Boyang, the deputy director of the general affairs department, repeatedly tried to persuade them, but they refused to leave and became even more aggressive, occupying the office and threatening them. The order was quite chaotic for a while. The stalemate lasted until 3:00 PM without any results. Finally, the police station sent police officers to disperse them and arrested two masterminds on the spot. Afterwards, inquiries were made to the responsible parties of the railway bureau. According to them, Sun Wenpin's contract for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway had expired in July last year. The former director, Chen Xinghan, had approved a renewal of the contract and ordered Sun Wenpin to deposit 1,000 yuan as a guarantee, pending approval. However, this matter has not yet been determined, and Sun Wenpin published a newspaper advertisement claiming to be the contractor, which was close to fraud. The Public Security Bureau questioned the railway bureau, which resulted in the contract not being approved and signed. The bureau is now publicly bidding to avoid private malfeasance. There are no restrictions on the qualifications of bidders or restrictions on Sun Wenpin from bidding. The bureau has not signed the renewal contract, so it does not bear any legal responsibility. The so-called tea and snack workers on the two railways are not railway workers, and the Central Government has explained this in the past. They are just contractors. Sun Wenpin claimed to be a tea and snack worker and attempted to cause trouble at the North Station. The military and police organs in Shanghai have taken strict measures to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Deng Wen Sent Representatives to Report on the War Situation</p>
<p>Vow to Fight to the End with the Enemy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association received a telegram yesterday from Deng Wen, the commander of the First Cavalry Army of Ma Zhanshan's troops, stating: "Shanghai Northeast Righteousness, foreign bandits bully, we soldiers are responsible for defending the country. Since the September 18th Incident, Wen has been encouraging his troops in the Black Mountains to fight to the death with the enemy. The situation over the years has been briefly described in the telegram. I am sending Li Mingxin and Ma Yuyuan (Ma Jinzi) as representatives to pay their respects and report everything in person. Please allow me to dare to do so. If the Japanese bandits do not retreat, I vow to fight to the end with the enemy. I have always admired your enthusiasm for the country and hope that you will give me advice so that I can follow it. I cannot express my gratitude enough. Deng Wen, Commander of the First Army of the Northeast National Salvation Garrison, respectfully kowtows, Qiaoyun, etc." It is heard that the two representatives, Li and Ma, met with the association yesterday to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang's Representative Yang Dezhao's Speech</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, at his residence in Shanghai yesterday. According to him, after the fall of Yuguan, the situation in North China became increasingly serious. Chairman Chen was concerned about the national crisis. On the 17th, he received a telegram from Chairman Chen, instructing him to convey to Chairman Chiang and President Ning that during the central planning for the war of resistance, the remaining bandits in Jiangxi could be eliminated by the troops stationed in Guangdong, and Guangdong Province was willing to do its best to assist the central government's anti-Japanese plan. I have met with President Song yesterday and reported everything in person, and I have asked President Song to convey it to Chairman Chiang. As for Zhang Fakui, he is currently traveling overseas and there is no definite date for his return. However, Zhang has expressed that if the central government needs his assistance to resist the invasion, he can return to the country immediately. Chief Minister Huang Shaoxiong of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has gone to Guangxi to inspect the autonomous experimental zone. As far as I know, he is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st.</p>
<p>All Circles Are Forming Rescue Teams</p>
<p>World Red Swastika Society</p>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society received a letter yesterday from the East Asia Relief Team No. 1, which set off for the Tianjin area, stating: "Since our team set off for Tianjin, in addition to working on disaster relief every day, we have also gone to the stations in Tianjin to take in disaster victims. Among them, those who are able to support themselves do not need relief, but most of them are in rags and look very miserable. Our team has now set up shelters at the stations to facilitate relief. In recent days, we have also treated dozens of wounded officers and soldiers who have retreated from Yuguan. "</p>
<p>Chinese Medical Association</p>
<p>The war clouds in North China are becoming increasingly dense, and rescue and protection should be urgently prepared. The Chinese Medical Association, in view of this, sent a telegram to its branches throughout the country at the end of last week, ordering them to register the doctors who are willing to serve so that they can be mobilized to depart immediately to serve on the front lines. A telegram has now been received from the Peiping branch, stating that the wounded soldiers' hospital there has been organized and is eagerly awaiting medical supplies and medical personnel from the south to make active preparations. A telegram has also been received from the Hong Kong branch, stating that the members there have risen up together and are willing to serve. Last night, the Shanghai branch held a general meeting to discuss the issue of rescue and protection. The members present were willing to work hard and elected Niu Huisheng, Fu Qing, Li Tingan, Zhu Hengbi, Ni Baochun, Bai Liangzhi, Rao Bosen, and other people to organize the Shanghai branch's rescue and protection committee. It was also decided to set up a registration office immediately at No. 41, Aiwenyi Road, Chihang Road, inside the association hall, to facilitate the registration of doctors who wish to serve. It is heard that the association's approach is to take the branches as the base and the general association as the backbone, and work together to form a well-organized rescue and protection system. It is hoped that rescue and protection personnel from all ports will hear the news and register with the association's general and branch associations to jointly relieve the national crisis.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng She, since the Jardine Matheson Taipan of the British company Jardine Matheson became embroiled in the Wusong dispute, two people, the deputy comprador Tong Chunhua and the accountant Hu Henian, have been arrested by the Hankou Haichang and sent to Shanghai by the Changxing Steamer of the Sanbei Company under police escort for investigation. The Relief Association sent personnel yesterday to petition the authorities to strictly investigate the case. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>De Facto Detention</p>
<p>It was originally scheduled that the Wusong Steamer would arrive in Shanghai yesterday. According to reliable sources, because the steamer forcibly expelled the sailors in the middle cabin, it aroused the anger of the sailors in Hankou, which resulted in the steamer's cargo not being unloaded, and there is a de facto detention.</p>
<p>Petition for Strict Investigation</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Wusong Steamer Tragedy Relief Association sent representatives Lu Shuangxi, Jiang Youming, and Shi Dianchen, representatives of the sailors in the middle cabin of the Wusong Steamer, and more than 20 other people to the Municipal Government, the Social Bureau, and the Special Municipal Party Headquarters of the Sailors' Union to petition for a strict investigation of Tong Chunhua and Hu Henian. At the same time, they demanded a swift mediation so that work</p>
<h3 id="e135">Delegation desired to meet Ma <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>When the League of Nations investigation delegation arrived in Shanghai, Chairman Ma sent Yu to Shanghai to observe the attitude of the Chinese people and secretly followed them from Beijing to Peiping to Shenyang. At that time, I planned to visit and report the actual situation, but ultimately gave up due to the strict Japanese military alert and the sincere advice of friends. Later, the investigation delegation went to Harbin. At that time, I disregarded everything and ventured to visit. Fortunately, with the help of a certain gentleman, arrangements were made in advance, and we finally met on May 15th at a certain place. We talked for two hours, and I reported all the facts in detail. At that time, the members of the investigation delegation were very willing to meet Chairman Ma, so I discussed the date and location with them. Although Chairman Ma had not yet entered Hailun, in order to facilitate this, I deliberately told them that he had arrived, and told them that in addition to the danger of Japanese planes on the journey, he was willing to take full responsibility, and could even order all the soldiers to line up along the railway line for alert. At that time, the members of the investigation delegation were all delighted, and then bid farewell, led by a certain Westerner, crossed from the basement into the neighboring house and went out, then secretly crossed the Songhua River and returned north. At that time, rumors of Japanese military attacks had spread in Hailun, and the people, supporting the old and carrying the young, were on the way in an endless stream. The next day, I went further south to Hailun to meet the members of the investigation delegation again, but their attitude had changed from yesterday, and they were unwilling to go north. I tried to persuade them to no avail. This was probably due to the bewitchment of the Japanese. Knowing that it was impossible to force them, I returned. On the evening of the 19th, the investigation delegation also left Harbin and returned south. Later, Chairman Ma met with two American reporters from the New York Times on the way to retreat from Hailun. They secretly took a train north, and then carried their luggage and trudged forward. They first encountered bandits, and when they told them where they were going, they were not harmed, but instead were led forward. When they reached the outpost of the Black Army, they left. Only then did the sentinel soldiers realize that they were bandits, but they did not pursue them. When the two reporters went to meet Chairman Ma, I was also present, writing down the actual situation, all in a huge volume. When they said goodbye, Chairman Ma also sent a car and dispatched soldiers to escort them. The people along the way warmly welcomed them, and there were even those who emptied the entire city to welcome them. The sincerity of the people can be imagined. When they returned to Harbin, the Japanese side learned of it, and they were arrested. Finally, all the documents were confiscated, but they were spared from disaster. One of them has now returned to his country, and the other is still staying in China. When I came here, I also met them and talked about everything, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Course of Retreating from Hailun <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Ma entered Hailun in May to command the anti-Japanese military affairs of Heilongjiang Province. At that time, the enemy army knew that Chairman Ma had arrived in Hailun, so they sent many planes to hover over the sky of Hailun every day and carry out bombing. I arrived in Hailun in late May. On May 30th, I was talking with Chairman Ma and others in a room when eight enemy planes soared in the air, their sights all focused on the room where Chairman Ma lived. Bombs fell like rain. Fortunately, the wind was very strong that day, and none of them hit. We had no choice but to accompany Chairman Ma out of the house and walk to avoid danger. However, the enemy planes tracked us left and right, firing machine guns. Chairman Ma and I took cover under the eaves, and bullets hit the roof tiles, and mud and ash fell, all brushing past the brims of our hats. For the sake of Chairman Ma's safety, we strongly advised Chairman Ma to leave Hailun temporarily and go to the countryside to avoid enemy planes. Chairman Ma firmly refused, willing to perish with Hailun. By that evening, the houses of the people in Hailun City were destroyed by enemy bombs everywhere, and the people were dying in piles, a tragic sight. For the sake of the safety of the surviving victims in the city, Chairman Ma finally sadly left Hailun that evening and left first.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Enduring Hunger and Cold in Bitter Fighting <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>After Chairman Ma met with the two reporters after retreating from Hailun, he led more than 1,000 troops to meet with Ding Chao and Li Du. The Japanese army learned of this and sent three armored ships to pursue them by water, and also sent more than 2,000 soldiers to surround them by land. Because they were outnumbered, they entered the deep mountains. The land there was mostly fine mud, which was so deep that it could submerge their shins, making it difficult to walk. Soldiers and horses collapsed from exhaustion. They only traveled more than 40 li a day. The food they carried was only two sheng of millet per person, and the mountain road was long and far, 400 li, with no trace of human habitation around. The food was about to run out, so they had no choice but to leave the mountains. When they encountered the Japanese army, they dispersed and fought back in the pond fields. The enemy's encirclement and attack were unsuccessful, so they retreated into the deep mountains again. They had nothing to eat for two days after the food ran out, so they had no choice but to slaughter old and weak horses, roast them, and eat them to satisfy their hunger. In the mountains, old trees provided shade, and dead leaves fell, as deep as a foot. Only dirty water accumulated. They slept on it at night, and their clothes were completely wet. Moreover, it rained a lot in the mountains. Their suffering was truly beyond words. At this time, Chairman Ma was not in good health. Every night, he would lay wooden branches on the ground and sleep in the open air, still happy and not feeling any pain. His spirit of vowing to die for the country can be imagined. As they advanced further, they saw a village house inhabited by those who privately planted opium. They stored a lot of grain. The soldiers all looked hungry and planned to buy food at a fair price. One of them, who used to be a battalion commander, recognized Chairman Ma and donated all the 100 dan of white flour and 200 shi of rice he had stored, leaving only a small amount for food. Chairman Ma firmly declined, but to no avail. Each soldier received two sheng of rice. Advancing further, they saw a train station after a month's journey. Knowing that they were near Qiqihar, the soldiers were wildly happy, urging their horses to gallop, eager to see houses, people, and animals first. After Chairman Ma met with Ding and Li, he handed over the troops to the two army commanders of the Tan Department and led them into Rehe. He himself went to see Cai Tingkai, He Zhuguo, etc. in secret.</p>

<p>Li Qingrong, a native of Shandong, 41 years old, lived at No. 13, Yuan Yi Fang, Yangshupu Road, and was a watchman. In May, his wife, Ms. Someone, suddenly ran away. Although Li sent people to search in all directions, he has not been found to this day. Because of this, Li was often annoyed in his heart, so he suddenly had the idea of ending his life the day before yesterday, and committed suicide by hanging himself in his bedroom alone. After Lin Changgen noticed, he immediately reported to the Yangshupu Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. After the investigation, they sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he had already died of suffocation. Then, the corpse was carried to the corpse examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Local Court and appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to come to the office to examine the corpse. After taking the case, he questioned Lin Changgen about the situation at the time. Mr. Guo then announced that the deceased, Li Qingrong, had committed suicide by hanging himself before his death. The corpse was handed over to his brother, Li Qingquan, to lead back to the coffin.</p>

<p>Zhang Liqiang, a native of Fenghua, Ningbo, 32 years old, a carpenter, lived at No. 14, Pingliang Road. At about 7 pm on the 4th of this month, he stayed in Dahua Department Store at No. 1432, Wuzhou Road to settle the debt. It happened that A Su, the seven-year-old daughter of a neighboring Cantonese woman, Zheng Wang, went to the company to play. Zhang was inherently lustful, had been a regular at brothels, and suffered from leukorrhea. Seeing that A Su was petite and exquisite, he suddenly had beastly desires. He lured her into the bedroom behind the store, covered her with a quilt, first teased her, then took off her pants, and raped her. Later, her mother found that her lower body was red and swollen and had white discharge when bathing A Su. After interrogating her about what happened, she reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and sent Chinese detective Peng Yushan to arrest Zhang and send A Su to Shanghai Convalescent Hospital on Lao Ba Zi Road. The doctor found that her hymen was ruptured and she was infected with leukorrhea, which would be difficult to cure for life. Zhang was sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that in recent years, cases of luring and raping young girls have occurred one after another in society, and morality and conscience have been lost. Zhang was suffering from leukorrhea and raped A Su, causing the girl's future happiness to be completely sacrificed. He requested that the defendant be given a severe sentence to warn others against following his example. After a detailed interrogation and clear confession in court, it was announced that the arguments had ended and the verdict would be announced. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday, Judge Zhao Linyu and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuze came to the Third Criminal Court to announce the verdict that Zhang Liqiang was sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a girl under the age of sixteen and causing serious injury, and deprived of his civil rights for life.</p>

<p>After the Fall of Yuguan, the death of Battalion Commander An Dexin in Yuguan was mourned by the whole country. An was a Muslim, so the Muslims in this city originally scheduled to hold a memorial service at the Qinglian Street Mosque in Nine Acres at 9 am yesterday to express their condolences. However, because Muslims from all over the country believed that An's death for the country was a glorious history for Muslims, they sent letters and telegrams to the Shanghai Mosque, requesting a postponement so that Muslims from afar could come to Shanghai to participate in the grand ceremony. Therefore, the mosque has changed the date to 9 am on the 29th of this month, still at the original location.</p>

<p>Already Approved by the Board of Directors</p>
<p>During the martial law period in this city last year, the Russian Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps temporarily recruited a number of members. Subsequently, in July, the Municipal Council approved the temporary retention of the 73 newly recruited Russian members until the end of the year, when the financial situation would be considered. On the 20th of last month, the Finance Committee discussed the matter and the commander of the Volunteer Corps reported that, according to the previous decision, these extra personnel could be temporarily retained pending the discussion of the budget. The Acting Director of the Finance Department believed that whether to retain them should be decided before considering the Volunteer Corps budget. The commander of the Volunteer Corps continued to state that the current number of Russian Company members, including these 73, was only enough to form the basic needs of three infantry companies in times of emergency. Each of these members costs about 1,000 taels of silver per year, and 73 members would require an additional expense of about 73,000 taels of silver. The committee then discussed the matter and concluded that, even in times of financial difficulty, dismissing these 73 people was not an economical solution. It was decided to retain these members long-term. This case was subsequently submitted to the Board of Directors on January 18 and has been adopted and implemented by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Lin Kanghou Talks About the Reasons for the Stalled Progress</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the issue of abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan has stalled in effect. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Lin Kanghou at the Bankers' Association yesterday to inquire about the reasons for the stall. According to him, Finance Minister Song Ziwen has repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai banking community on the issue of abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan, and considerable progress has been made. The reason why it has not been realized is that the improper assembly of machinery in the mint is one of the reasons for the stalled progress of the case, and the Japanese invasion of Yuguan is also sufficient to restrain the progress of the case. However, Minister Song hopes to resolve this case in the shortest possible time, so he gathered the Shanghai banking community again at the end of last year to continue the discussion. It is heard that the coinage standard has been decided, etc., it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Way Out for Apprentices <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhu Shulin丨</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to poverty, I dropped out of junior high school without graduating! Naturally, the only way out for us young people who drop out halfway is to become shop apprentices. I couldn't escape the control of this environment, so I came to this lifeless old-fashioned shop to be an unfortunate apprentice. However, I have my hopes, and I am determined not to stagnate and not move forward. I am always preparing to work hard. I think: students are the future masters of the country, and their future prospects are very great, but like me, I have no knowledge, where in society is my place to stand? Now that the Examination Yuan has been established, everyone must pass an examination to find a job, and applying for the examination requires certain qualifications, such as graduating from middle school, graduating from university, studying foreign trade, etc. I do not have any of these qualifications. Should I go back to school? That cannot be done, so I cannot take the exam. If I cannot take the exam, how will I find a job in the future? Alas! I am extremely panicked! Please, sir, think of a good way to guide me!</p>
<p>Reply: There are three questions to answer in your letter: The first is the [apprentice] question. Judging from the meaning of the letter, you seem to regard being an apprentice as unfortunate, and this should also be studied separately. If you look at the entire class of apprentices (tens of thousands) and put them in your eyes, and contrast them with those who are well-fed and well-clothed, who own huge sums of money, and who have powerful people driving in high carriages, and discover the unhappiness of the apprentices, this is correct. If you only see those who are rich and powerful and envy them, thinking, [they are men, and I am also a man], why can they be promoted and get rich, but I cannot? Between the square inches, admiration arises, and if it develops from this, and if you are lucky, you will also become a rich and powerful person in the future, then the result will not be the same as them? Once you become the boss, you will treat your apprentices in the same way as your boss treats you now, or perhaps even more severely, then your idea today is wrong. The second is the problem of [students] and [the future masters of the country]. Normally speaking, students are naturally [the future masters of the country]. In fact, the positions that students stand on are also different. From A's point of view, students in A's position are the masters, while students in his position are in the ranks of the oppressed. Similarly, when students in his position are the masters, students in A's position are again oppressed. Therefore, the sentence [students are the future masters of the country], strictly speaking, is really illogical. It would be more reasonable to say that young students of a certain class are the future masters of the country or society. The third is the [examination] problem. In fact, the government's examination is only limited to civil servants, and it does not mean that everyone must pass the examination to eat. Civil servants are some officials, do you envy them? That means your [official heart] has not retreated, otherwise, what are you afraid of? Isn't it good to be an apprentice? If you can wholeheartedly be a top-notch person in the apprentice society, fight for more freedom for the apprentice society, and give the apprentice society more happiness, even if you suffer yourself, that is actually nobler than being a high official or a big boss. Otherwise, you will, by fate, climb to the point of being an official, and be able to make a few official-style articles of [and so on] [pursuant to this], write a few [Mr. Eight-Sided-Sharp] test papers, or be promoted to the position of old boss, with a few pennies, that is only adding a new comrade to the team of bureaucrats and rich people, and adding an enemy to the shop assistants and apprentices. We definitely don't want you to have such thoughts.</p>

<p>㈠ To Mr. Lu Dafeng: Marriage between people with the same surname was not allowed in the past, but according to the current Civil Code, there is no such restriction. It only stipulates: 1. Direct blood relatives and direct in-laws; 2. Collateral blood relatives and collateral in-laws of different generations (but collateral blood relatives beyond the eighth degree and collateral in-laws beyond the fifth degree are not subject to this restriction); 3. Collateral blood relatives of the same generation within the eighth degree (cousins are not subject to this restriction) cannot marry. If the [distant ancestor without mourning garments] mentioned in your letter can be calculated to be outside the above-mentioned kinship, although the same surname can be married without hindrance. Moreover, marriage autonomy is clearly stated in the law, and the other party has reached adulthood (20 years old), so they can freely marry anyone. ㈡ To Mr. Ma Xiangsan: High talent admired, but this newspaper cannot hire you for the time being, please forgive me!</p>

<p>丨Miss Dou is the First丨</p>
<p>To the Education Research Institute of Sun Yat-sen University</p>
<p>Zhuang Yixuanbo, director of the Education Research Institute of National Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, attended the World Education Conference in Europe last summer and reported on the recent situation of new education in China, which was greatly welcomed by people from various countries. When passing through London, he received a letter from the University Federation Committee established in London by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to various parts of Britain to give lectures. Dr. Zhuang politely declined due to time constraints. Recently, the committee followed the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Agreement to send students to study in China. Miss Dou (Miss Darroch) was the first to be sent to the institute to study Chinese education issues. Miss Dou grew up in China in her childhood and is proficient in Chinese. After returning to England, she specialized in education at the University of Edinburgh. After graduating, she served as a teacher in primary and secondary schools in that country. Recently, she served as a researcher at the Imperial Education Research Institute in London. She was selected from among many applicants to be sent to China this time and can be called the first person formally sent to China by Britain to study abroad. After arriving in Guangdong, she has discussed research steps in detail with Dr. Zhuang and decided to go north to conduct field investigations and collect data in the near future, and then return to Guangdong in May and June to organize the results and prepare a report. Dr. Zhuang has introduced her to primary and secondary schools in Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Pingjin, and other countries in Western Europe to visit, and has met with important officials of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department</p>
<h3 id="e157">Announcement to Student Parents <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Schools hope for family support</p>
<p>Families should collaborate with schools</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Education, in light of the prevailing poor academic atmosphere, superficial learning, and cries of educational bankruptcy heard across the nation in recent years, believes that to remedy the situation, it is necessary to first rectify academic conduct. This can only be achieved through the combined efforts of both schools and families to achieve complete success. Therefore, regarding the strengths and weaknesses of students' personalities, changes in their thinking, the quality of their habits, and their diligence in studies, if there are aspects the school cannot fully understand, parents should communicate these, providing guidance. Furthermore, regarding the school's discipline and whether students follow the corrections of teachers, and whether students can improve, the family should also assist and urge them to put the corrections into practice. Close collaboration between families and schools is essential for rectification. Two types of forms have been designed. One is a report on the general academic and behavioral status of primary and secondary school students, to be filled out by the school, reporting on the student's academic performance and conduct during the semester to the parents, and including matters for which the school hopes for parental support. The other is a parent report form, to be filled out by the parents before the start of each semester, reporting to the school on the student's condition at home during the holidays, and including matters for which the parents hope for support from the school. Director Zhou also personally wrote a letter to student parents, hoping that all parents would sincerely assist in areas where the school falls short. The letter is several thousand words long and extremely earnest. However, due to the imminent end of the current semester, it could not be implemented. Instructions have been issued to all public and private primary and secondary schools in the province to implement it at the end of the next semester, and to closely observe each item on the form during normal times as a basis for future reporting, and not to do it perfunctorily or superficially. All family communications and parent-teacher conferences should still be held regularly to provide more opportunities for family contact.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Attached: Director Zhou's Letter to Parents of All Jiangsu Students <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, academic conduct has declined, learning has become superficial, and cries of educational bankruptcy have been heard across the nation. Informed people are deeply concerned. Based on my observations, I deeply understand that to remedy the situation, it is necessary to first rectify academic conduct. To rectify academic conduct, it is necessary to combine the efforts of both schools and families to achieve complete success. Therefore, I offer my humble thoughts, hoping that you will understand, consider, and adopt them.</p>
<p>In the past, some, clinging to the name of liberalism, vigorously advocated a free academic atmosphere. One person initiated it, and the whole world followed suit. This led to today's bad habits, viewing resistance to authority and violation of discipline as revolutionary spirit, and reckless abandon as individual development. Strictness was seen as oppression, and order as restraint. Students were accustomed to conspiracy, and indulged in romance. Superficiality and recklessness became almost universal vices. As a result, there was a trend of students choosing teachers at school, and at home, there were loud calls for anti-filial revolution. Even the fundamental norms on which human society relies for maintenance were about to be broken and destroyed. Families could not restrain them, teachers could not control them, and even the power of the government was sometimes exhausted. News of student unrest was reported daily in newspapers. Minor issues could trigger major disturbances. The beginnings of incidents became increasingly strange, causing those running schools to be physically and mentally exhausted, only able to deal with student unrest. The drawbacks of freedom have led to this. Is this what the initiators expected? Seeds of good grain have all become weeds, and roots of fragrant grass have turned into thorns. The nation has been running schools for over thirty years, and the price it has received in return is like this. Concern for the nation is no less than concern for foreign enemies and domestic troubles.</p>
<p>I have carefully considered the crux of the problem and firmly believe that if we want to talk about education today, we must govern Shu like Marquis Wu, using strict measures to awaken self-awareness, and guiding them with principles to return to the normal path. Therefore, I strongly oppose the idea of freedom and adhere to the principle of strictness. Whenever student unrest occurs, I take decisive action. Those who do not follow teachings are given severe sanctions. If the offense is too serious, even if it is near graduation, they will be painfully expelled, never allowing a harmful element to remain just because of their temporary merits. Knowing that bad habits are deeply ingrained, and that the measures implemented may not be effective in transforming people, even if I receive high criticism for this, I will never dare to be lenient to please the public. I have also served as the head of a university, and have always treated young people as friends. I have no intention of harming them. However, because I am responsible for education and know where the problem lies, if I repeat past leniency to gain a reputation for tolerance, and sit idly by while education goes bankrupt without trying to remedy it, how can I live up to the nation's intention in establishing my position, and how can I comfort the heavy responsibility placed upon me by parents and elders? Therefore, I do not seek understanding in advance.</p>
<p>However, education values disciplinary measures, and even more so, positive guidance. It is unreasonable and difficult to feel at ease if there is only punishment without teaching. Therefore, I have promulgated a system that combines teaching and discipline, strictly ordering all schools to conscientiously comply. Regular assessments are also based on this, ensuring that knowledge and action are equally valued. Teachers share the responsibility of moral education, and personal influence and education should have a subtle effect. Teaching people is like supporting a drunk; without much support, they will easily fall. Therefore, the efforts of the school alone are not enough to complete the task of moral education, and I must ask for the full assistance of all parents. Moreover, the decline in academic conduct today has become a deeply rooted problem. Unless administrative agencies, school authorities, and parents work together to remedy it, it will be impossible to achieve the effect of rectification. Today, the number of students in a school is often over a thousand, and at least several hundred. Even with good teachers, there are only a hundred or so. Their eyes and ears may not be able to reach everywhere, and their influence may not be fully effective. School is a group life. If one part is bad, the whole is destroyed. If one person is not good, the whole is tarnished. Therefore, individual training is the basis of group training. Regarding the strengths and weaknesses of students' personalities, changes in their thinking, the quality of their habits, and their diligence in studies, if there are aspects the school cannot fully understand, parents should communicate these, providing guidance. Furthermore, regarding the school's discipline and whether students follow the corrections of teachers, and whether students can improve, the family should also assist and urge them to put the corrections into practice. Only with such wholehearted support can we achieve twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, with morals declining and society becoming polluted, external temptations are abundant, and young people lack the ability to resist. Those who set traps to ensnare them are also everywhere. Sliding into evil is like a landslide; this is human nature. The school's year-round education is no match for society's one-day temptation. Therefore, in life outside of school, it is particularly important for families and schools to jointly guard against and supervise each other to avoid the dangers of straying down the wrong path. I have observed that the higher the grade level, the worse the academic conduct, and the older the age, the less effective the moral education. The virtues cultivated in elementary school are gradually destroyed in middle school, and almost completely disappear in college. The effect of education is reversed, which is deeply regrettable. It is like growing a tree. Elementary school is the beginning of germination, and middle school is the period of forming the trunk. Whether it becomes useful material is determined at this time. Once they enter college, the patterns have been formed, and it is difficult to refine them. Therefore, the strictness of moral education is most important in secondary education, and parental supervision is also essential for middle school students. If supervision is effective and guidance is timely, then everyone can become an excellent child, and everyone can become a useful person. Since the school is an educational institution, the responsibility for moral education is undeniable. The school system, regulations, curriculum, and progress are also uniformly regulated by the government. However, situations may be unfamiliar, attention may be insufficient, execution may be weak, and management may be inadequate. All of these rely on you, parents, to provide guidance, supervision, and assistance, ensuring that families and schools become one, understanding that the success or failure of their children is a matter of personal interest, and viewing the guidance of their children as a shared responsibility. Then, the rectification of academic conduct and the revival of education can be expected soon. Perhaps a small number of parents, witnessing the decline of academic conduct, do not actively assist, but instead passively resist. The result will be that students lose faith in the school, and the school has no way of knowing how to improve. If feelings are alienated, how can the long-term expectations of parents be met? I believe that close contact between families and schools is essential for rectifying academic conduct. Therefore, I have specifically ordered all schools to make every effort to maintain close contact with all parents, and the department has issued a type of form. One is filled out by the school, reporting on the student's academic and behavioral status during the semester to the parents after the end of each semester, and including matters for which the school hopes for parental support. The other is filled out by the parents, reporting to the school on the student's condition at home during the holidays before the start of each semester, and including matters for which the parents hope for support from the school. I deeply understand that the cost of children attending school today is a hundred times what it was in the past. The income of a middle-class family is not enough to cover the cost of one person's education. Most parents endure hardship, live frugally, and work hard to enable their children to study. Therefore, their expectations are certainly different from others. I feel a great sense of responsibility, and therefore, I hope for even more parental assistance. I sincerely hope that you, parents, will wholeheartedly assist in areas where the school authorities fall short. Then, academic conduct will certainly be rectified, learning will be corrected, and students will become pillars of the nation and virtuous children of the family, and both the nation and the family will benefit. I have specifically listed the methods of contact below, hoping that you will consider them favorably.</p>
<p>1.  Communicate with the school regularly to express your opinions.</p>
<p>2.  Carefully review the school's report form and conscientiously fulfill what the school hopes from parents.</p>
<p>3.  Report to the school in detail on the student's extracurricular life and offer concrete suggestions.</p>
<p>4.  Schools and parents should jointly organize regular meetings to discuss all educational matters.</p>
<p>5.  Be sure to attend the school's parent-teacher conferences.</p>
<p>6.  Schools and parents should assist each other as much as possible within the scope of what is feasible. (For example, schools can assist families with writing letters and resolving difficulties, and parents can assist schools by urging their children to abide by school rules and supporting all school facilities.)</p>
<p>The above methods may inevitably be incomplete, but with a spirit of cooperation, there will be no lack of opportunities for cooperation. The key to movement lies in the mind. I hope that you, the parents of all Jiangsu students, will not simply stand aside as spectators, assuming that your children are already under the school's care and management.</p>

<p>Exceptional Team Skill</p>
<p>Sure to Provide a Fresh Perspective</p>
<p>The Central Military Academy basketball team, which has been winning acclaim in the capital, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday evening and lodged at the Chinese YMCA. They will face the runner-up of the Xiqing Basketball League, Hujiang University basketball team, at the Xiqing basketball court at 8:00 PM tonight. The meeting of these two strong teams is expected to be a spectacle. The game between the Military Academy and McRae Levin has been rescheduled to next Wednesday.</p>

<p>Last night at 9:00 PM, Instructor Yu Jie led the entire team in practice at the Xiqing court. Observing their strengths, ㈠ their physical strength is robust. It is said that the whole team becomes more and more courageous as they fight, and they can play two consecutive games without fatigue. ㈡ Accurate long-range shooting is one of the special features of the military team. Few shots outside the free-throw line are missed, and they can break through even if the opponent's defense is tight. ㈢ Everything is done practically, whether it is passing, shooting, or dribbling. They are very skilled and can handle everything with ease. The overall spirit of the Northern team is similar to the Northeast University basketball team from last time.</p>

<p>Tonight's game was originally scheduled against McRae Levin, but because three players from Hujiang urgently needed to return home, they requested to move the game forward. Therefore, the game with Hujiang was moved to tonight, and the game with McRae Levin was moved to next Wednesday. Hujiang is known for its agility. It will be difficult to determine the winner tonight. The Military Academy is used to a smaller court and outdoor play. It is hoped that the venue will not diminish their performance.</p>

The Military Academy defeated McRae Levin twice in Beijing. It is hoped that they can leave a very good impression in Shanghai and bring honor to the Chinese in Shanghai. The Chinese basketball community may be revitalized by the arrival of the Military Academy. Work hard, Military Academy athletes!</p>
<h3 id="e180">Xiqing Hosts <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Military Academy has a total of four games in Shanghai, all starting at 8:00 PM at the Xiqing basketball court. The reason for holding the games at Xiqing instead of the Chinese basketball court this time is that the Chinese basketball court has a schedule set by the Shanghai Basketball Association that cannot be changed. This only benefits foreign interests, which is a pity for the Chinese Physical Education Association. It is hoped that they can also arrange one or two games.</p>

<p>Results of Last Night's Six Games</p>

<p>㈤ Youtai Defeats Meigong 45 to 10</p>
<p>㈥ Chuguang Defeats Chendui 38 to 17</p>
<p>Last night, the Shanghai Basketball Association's first salvo was a dud. Seven Stars in Group B3 forfeited again, and Zhengfeng won 2-0 by default. Zhengfeng has forfeited twice and had its competition rights revoked. The second game between Quanhei and Yaoguang was a fierce battle. Both teams had good skills and could be considered evenly matched. In the end, Quanhei won 31 to 26. In the third game, Fako faced Hongdui, a guest team made up of Donghua athletes. The disparity was obvious. The Red Children could only use their feet, and their hand skills were poor. Fako won a big victory with 56 to 17. In the fourth game, Youai had a good performance. The foreigners were no match. Chuji suffered a major defeat with 18 to 63. Moreover, they were completely shut out in the first half. Youai won by a total of 33 points. In the fifth game, the Jewish kids were well-organized and had a great formation. Their combat style was very impressive. In particular, the center Hai Xueke and the guards Zha Bomen and Bolinggai were the best players. The entire team was very balanced and far superior to the increasingly weak Meigong. In the end, Youtai won a big victory with 45 to 10. The closing act, Chuguang versus Chendui, was a good performance. Chuguang has recovered its old form. The players are small but lively and good at fighting. Chendui stubbornly resisted, but they were not a match. In the end, Chuguang won 38 to 17. Tonight is the first night of Group A games. The game starts at 7:30 PM between Qidui and Xiaguang. The results of last night's games and tonight's schedule are listed below.</p>

<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>On the 18th, it snowed all day. This filthy city of Shanghai was cleansed on the surface. Around dusk, I braved the cold and snow to solve the problem of eating. From the hands of a news vendor running around and shouting in the snow, I bought a large newspaper and took it to the YMCA cafeteria to eat and read. Who knew that when I opened the newspaper, there would be a headline with six large characters that caught my eye, reading [All Frozen to Death on the Mountain Peak]. Next to it were three smaller lines: [Volunteer Army of Four Hundred Unyielding to the Death]; [Resisting to the End in Bitter Cold]; [Still Firmly Holding Knives and Guns After Death]. Just these few headlines made me feel a surge of heat rising straight from my core. I murmured the words that Zhang Xun, who defended Tang Dynasty's Yongyang, said to Nan Jiyun: [Nan Ba, a man dies, but he must not yield to injustice!] I thought that our country has four hundred good men who hold knives and guns, freezing to death on the mountain ridge without yielding to injustice. And then, I thought of the other volunteer armies who swallowed ice, bathed in blood, and vowed to kill the enemy. How could this be a sign of national demise? I read this tragic news again and again. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness filled my heart, and I could never forget it. And the food I ate stopped in my stomach and could not be digested. I thought this news had the value of being passed down forever to commemorate it. So, with a sincere heart, I respectfully transcribed it as follows:</p>
<p>[The volunteer army of Deng Tiemei, who were trapped in Xiuyan, retreated into Dagushan in mid-December of last year. They built a very solid defensive position on the mountain to resist for a long time. The Japanese army's Kamimura Brigade has been besieging the mountain for more than half a month. On the 11th, the Japanese army sent troops into the mountain to search and found 380 bodies of volunteer soldiers. They refused to surrender to the end. In the bitter cold of minus 20 degrees, they still had to resist strongly. In the end, due to lack of food and thin clothing, they all froze to death. The situation was extremely tragic! Most of the bodies were wearing summer clothes and had been frozen to death for many days. They were still holding knives and guns in their hands. The Japanese army was quite moved.]</p>
<p>Dear readers, what do you think after reading this news? We are all Chinese people. Why do we put the heavy responsibility of [holding weapons to defend the country] entirely on the shoulders of the volunteer army? Where are our millions of brave generals and soldiers who are brave in internal wars? How can those adults and gentlemen who indulge in extravagance, sensuality, and endless dancing and singing face the four hundred soldiers who resisted to the end and froze to death on the mountain ridge? Alas! The four hundred people of Deng's army in Xiuyan are more worthy of weeping and singing than the five hundred people of Tian Heng's island in that year. I would like to buy silk to embroider their deeds, cast gold to record them, and I hope that the country's writers will praise them with poems and articles, and the country's artists will depict them with paintings and sculptures, so that the four hundred people's national spirit will be immortal. Even if China perishes, the spirit of these four hundred people will not be extinguished!</p>

<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>Dusk, the time when day and night alternate, the myriad silver lights on the road begin to illuminate the nightlife of the city, where people both enjoy and suffer.</p>
<p>The cold wind roars, flattering the rich and abusing the poor. Cars break through the cold wind and rush to theaters, dance halls, restaurants, hotels, and general meeting places. They go to see plays, enjoy themselves in the green wine and red lights with dancing girls whose bodies tremble, get drunk and full, gather together, make secret appointments, and gamble. In short, it is materialistic enjoyment.</p>
<p>At the same time, the poor in the cold wind are crying with their families in dilapidated alleys and broken houses, suffering from hunger and cold. There are also those who work in the cold wind, hoping for a full meal tomorrow. Under the streetlights, you can also see women who sell their youth and flesh, crushing their souls under the tyrannical power of pimps, hoping that a customer will be their savior in the pit of fire for one day.</p>
<p>Ah, tall buildings and mansions, heavy fur coats, stoves and water heaters, wine and food, cigarettes, women and pleasure. In such an environment, what is there to fear from the cruel cold wind?</p>
<p>Surrounded by hunger and cold, the weeping of wives and children, and the struggle of the poor, there is only one body, boiling with heat, and blood leaping with a red heart to resist the great difficulties given by this era and society.</p>
<p>Urban nightlife continues like this. Will it continue like this forever?</p>
<h3 id="e190">Talking About "Specialization" <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ziqin</p>
<p>I remember when I was a student, there was a very strict Chinese teacher. His nickname was Mr. Despot because he often liked to set essay topics about the word "specialization," such as "A Discussion on Specialization," "A辨 of Arbitrariness," "A 論 of Republic and Despotism"! Not only that, but all the essay topics he set were not allowed to use colloquial language, and had to be written in classical Chinese. So, they gave him this nickname that was [true to his name]. When I did his essays, I always hated not having read the Four Books and Five Classics in my youth, but I had to put together hundreds of words to hand in my paper. At first, I could still deal with his "specialization" topics, but when he set several "specialization" topics in a row, I turned the annotations under the entry of [寸] in the Kangxi dictionary into a new version. I wrote about [Specialization, that is, focusing on one thing, also one thing; professionalism, that is, focusing one's studies on one thing], and came up with a set of [unpleasant texts].</p>
<p>Now, times have changed, and the position of the word "specialization" has been fundamentally shaken. Therefore, [despotism] has died, and all the nouns that are unique to the word [specialization] have been taken away by Western words. For example, [arbitrariness] has been transformed into Fascisti, [professionalism] can be changed to Trust.</p>
<p>What is even more advanced is that the term [focusing one's studies on one thing] is no longer fashionable now. At the very least, it should be renamed [academic omnipotence] or [becoming an official is the first priority, academic is the second].</p>
<p>Not only has the literal meaning of the word [specialization] been occupied, but its meaning has also changed. Look, a universal doctor who can treat [internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, and pediatrics] must put [specializes in all departments] on their sign or business card. If they do not put the word [specialization], people will suspect that their medical skills are not profound.</p>
<p>In short, the word [specialization] is outdated, and there is no need to talk about [focusing on one thing] anymore. However, the [despotism] that has already died is rebelling again. You have to keep an eye on it. The Japanese are shaping and preparing to say goodbye to your lover. Driving the strong enemy out of Shanhaiguan and recovering the lost land in the Northeast is the responsibility of our youth.</p>

<p>— Yan Duoguang</p>
<p>A seductive girl, young men see her, she is as lovely as a beautiful little bird, and as docile as a tame sheep.</p>
<p>A passionate and promising young man, he is drunk in the little bird's nest, in the sheep's den all day long, dissipating the courage to move forward, and falling into the abyss of decadence!</p>
<p>The sound of cannons at Yuguan is heard as the sound of New Year's firecrackers, and the mad shouts of fighting are heard as cheers of celebration. I long for him to wake up soon! I am anxious that he cannot free himself immediately!</p>
<p>I shouted loudly, advising you not to mistake the girl's lipstick for honeyed words, and when you kiss her, you must be aware that after tasting her sweet honeyed words, a sharp sword will be left in your abdomen!</p>
<p>She sucks your blood and absorbs your essence. Her muscles become fuller because she sucks your blood, and her face becomes more delicate because she absorbs your essence. At that time, your blood is dry, and your essence is exhausted. Be careful of the sword in her abdomen! She will turn her head and abandon you in the outer space, causing you to be annoyed, cry bitterly, and go to the dead end of suicide.</p>
<p>Useful young men! Be excited! Do not be drunk in the river of love! You must know that the river of love has thousands of feet of waves, no matter how brave and ambitious you are, it can knock you to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>— Liao Hongshou Juan</p>
<p>The road from the Oriental Villa to the pond was very quiet, but Mr. and Mrs. Dongfang and Ouyang Sheng often came here. In the past, they would sometimes run and laugh, walking back and forth, but now it was different. Xiaoman would call out; [Little otter, is it not good? Let us walk together arm in arm.] So, she took her husband's left hand and the little otter's right hand, and walked and laughed without any scruples. Little otter was often on Xiaoman's lips, ever since the first time she said it jokingly.</p>
<p>I remember one morning, Dongfang Sheng was reading poetry in the study. He had no intention of going out, so only Xiaoman accompanied Ouyang, holding the fishing rod, and went to the pond again. They sat down under a weeping willow. The dew on the shore had not yet dried, and it was all green. He put down the fishing rod and chatted and laughed with Xiaoman. Although the float moved several times, he never picked it up. He praised Xiaoman, saying that her eyes were as lively as fish, and her eyebrows were as slender as the willow leaves on her head. Finally, he murmured for a long time and said, [Man, if I had someone like you to be my companion, I would be willing to sacrifice everything.] Mrs. Dongfang did not take offense at his words. She laughed loudly, threw her head on his shoulder, and stared at Ouyang Sheng's face, laughing at each other. She was laughing at his infatuation, and Ouyang was laughing at her innocence.</p>
<p>At this time, Dongfang Sheng did not know that Ouyang had expressed his love for Xiaoman. This could be seen in several ways. At the same time, although he was very clear about the honesty and purity of the two, he was misunderstood by a note that was accidentally found on Ouyang's desk. There were a few sentences inside: [I am lonely because of you, drifting like a wanderer is not as good, so I am willing to give you a kind of comfort, so that you feel sweet even in your dreams. You sometimes talk very sickeningly, I do not ask. But please avoid the front of the parrot, because I do not hope that the parrot learns to be as frivolous as you.] He recognized Xiaoman's handwriting and could not help but feel sad.</p>
<p>A sick person cannot withstand stimulation the most. In this situation, Dongfang Sheng gradually became thinner. His old illness was mixed with new sorrows, and he only felt heavier and heavier. Ouyang Sheng ran to the city every day to seek doctors and buy medicine, but Dongfang Sheng showed no improvement. Time was approaching late autumn again. One day, Dongfang Sheng asked Xiaoman and Ouyang to accompany him to the pond. On the road, they were still walking side by side, but they were not laughing and talking. Dongfang Sheng inspected the pond for a week. The willow leaves were floating all over the pond, covering the ripples. He smiled bitterly and said to the sky; [My Lord, let me return myself to you here.] (II)</p>

<p>— Zhu Shouren</p>
<p>丨A Tour of the Shanjuan Cave丨</p>
<p>After a moment of sightseeing, Mr. Chu led the tour to the upper cave (also known as the Warm Cave, or the Great Qi Sea). The cave entrance is level with the wall and connected to the rear of the middle cave. At the entrance, there are stone steps on both sides to ascend. The moonlight is hazy, and the clouds and mist fly about! It is a separate world, seemingly not of this earth. It is approximately ten acres in size, divided into upper and lower levels, like a stage with side buildings. Two large, natural stone pillars stand majestically within it. Five or six gas lamps are lit inside the cave. Viewing them from several dozen feet away, it is like glimpsing distant stars through the gaps in the clouds. Stone steps wind around, twisting and turning. The mountain air is abundant, the walls are moist and glistening, and it is warm like entering a bathhouse. Coupled with the fragrance of Phoebe zhennan freshly steamed, the fragrant mist is rich. I then realized that the moonlight and flying clouds I saw earlier were merely illusions created by the mountain air and lamplight. Mr. Chu said, "This air is only present in winter, and it is even more intense when it is severely cold. Even if one is naked, one does not feel the cold during heavy snowfall. If one tours at night with torches, the illusions are numerous, creating a wonderful scene of clouds and mist, truly marvelous!" Relying on electric torches, we followed the stone steps, circling back and forth, ascending and descending several times, yet still could not discern its capacity.</p>
<p>After the tour, we turned back to the Luoyan Small Abode and then proceeded to the lower cave. The cave is higher than the middle cave. At its highest point, a thousand-foot electric torch is needed to illuminate it. In front is a small waterfall called Yin Jian. Although the water is not vast, the moss is green and dripping, and the melody of the spring bursts forth. Inside the cave, strange rocks jut out, steep cliffs and hard rocks display unusual formations, piled up and hanging upside down from the cave ceiling. If even a slight gust of wind were to move them, they might fly away with the white clouds. On the walls, unusual rocks are formed into the shape of pine trees, with straight trunks reaching the sky and horizontal branches supporting a canopy. Going further inside, it gradually narrows, becoming dark and secluded, with nothing visible. It extends for three miles to reach the rear cave, but unfortunately, we did not venture to explore it. Returning to the Luoyan Small Abode, Mr. Chu had already prepared tea and refreshments, awaiting us. During the meal, he delivered a welcoming speech, which was responded to by Mr. Yao Yuangan, a member of the Standing Committee of the delegation.</p>
<p>After a brief rest, we exited the Chaoxu Hall, crossed a small ridge, and reached the rear cave (also known as the Water Cave). The cave is located at the foot of the mountain, several yards wide, only a few feet high, shaped like a crescent moon, with wisteria and vines like curtains, flying smoke hanging dimly. A clear stream flows straight into the cave. A small boat is moored at the entrance, capable of holding eight people. The boatman held a torch in his hand while rowing. Those who arrived first among the members eagerly boarded the boat. Wielding the oars, we entered, and after about twenty minutes, emerged. Inside the cave, the passage twists and turns, reaching a depth of sixty yards. In high places, it can be about ten feet tall, while in low places, one must crouch in the boat to pass through. The stone patterns are mottled, and it is gloomy and cold, like entering the underworld. Regrettably, due to the large number of people and limited time, it was difficult to explore thoroughly. In total, we entered twice, carrying eighteen people. By then, it was past three o'clock. I arrived late and was unable to join in. However, reserving this as a voucher for a future visit is also a great thing. I then bid farewell to Mr. Chu, made arrangements for a visit to Gengsang the next day, boarded the boat, and arrived in Yi at eight o'clock at night.</p>
<p>丨A Tour of the Gengsang Cave丨</p>
<p>On the sixth morning, we went to the East Gate to board a boat. The route went through the East Jiu River, where the waterway was relatively narrow and there were many boats traveling back and forth. We first arrived at the Shushan to view the Zisha (purple clay) kilns, and at noon, we docked at Huwenzhen. We disembarked and walked about seven miles, arriving at the Chaoyang Taoist Temple, where an image of Zhang Gong (Lord Zhang) is enshrined. There is a Gan Quan (Sweet Spring) stele in the temple. Further on, we arrived at the Gengsang Cave on Mengfeng Mountain. The cave was where Zhou Kangcangzi (Master Kangcang of Zhou) lived in seclusion, Gengsang being his courtesy name. The Records of Local Customs by Zhou Chu state that Zhang Daoling of the Han Dynasty cultivated the Tao here, hence it is also known as Zhang Gong Cave. Some say it was where Guo Lao (Immortal Guo) attained enlightenment, but details are impossible to ascertain. Mr. Chu and others were already waiting for us there. They led us to the rear cave, which was very high and spacious, with dozens of stone steps leading directly to a platform. Then, crossing the Dafan (Great Fan) ridge, we turned to the front cave, named Tianbian Dachang (Heavenly Bamboo Field), which was as large as ten acres, as open as a large building. Stalactites hung down, pure and bright, the large ones several embraces around, the small ones filling a grasp, like dangling baby necklaces, like hanging crown tassels, like dragon whiskers, like tiger teeth, like fluttering pearl banners, like icicles dripping from the eaves, exquisite and strange, indescribable. The name "Heavenly Necklace" is no exaggeration. At the cave's upper entrance, various trees were lush and green, and a subtle fragrance assailed the nostrils. Sunlight shone through, making one feel like an immortal. Stone steps of varying heights on both sides spiraled in all directions, like walking on a perilous plank road, like climbing a ladder to heaven. The scenery circled around, leading directly to the mountain ridge. Looking back at the cave entrance, it was like a giant monster opening its mouth, as if wanting to choose someone to devour, to grease its sharp teeth. After the climb, Mr. Chu had already laid out fruits, snacks, fragrant tea, and refreshments in the Tianbian Dachang, welcoming us. We then all partook of the tea and snacks. Mr. Chu briefly described the scenic spots in the cave and the transportation situation. Tax Commissioner Yang Mingxin and renowned painter Hu Boxiang also gave speeches one after another.</p>

The forward silver price also showed a reaction, down several mills. Private telegrams from banks also reported nothing inspiring, opening high at 800 taels and 0.009 candareens. The exchange market opened at the same price as the previous close, so it remained static outside 800 taels for a long time. Later, demand seemed to surge, seeing 800.02 taels and 0.003 candareens, but the exchange market did not show a tightening trend. Afterward, it became slightly firmer. April's British exchange rate of 3.5 and the American exchange rate of 1.875 both had sellers, seeing downstream. Preliminary knowledge of the posted prices was unchanged, breaking the 800 tael barrier. The bank's position also turned sluggish as a result. After entering, the May American exchange rate of 0.375 was difficult to sell, falling to 795 taels and 0.006 candareens. The market learned that the Central Bank had a second opening spot trading message, slightly rising. After entering, it lingered around 7 taels. Although the exchange market had occasional entries and exits, the price also turned flat. The initial after-market slightly showed a falling trend, rising and then falling twice to 795 taels and 0.004 candareens, as Bombay reported a rise of one anna. After that, it flattened and then rose again, as the Central Bank was still working hard to open spot trading. However, it continued to hover. Later, Bombay again reported a drop of one anna, and morale recovered. Later, listening to the Central Bank continuing to open a large amount of spot trading, the exchange market also improved slightly as a result, once briefly rising to 800 taels, but sellers actively offered, still falling back. Finally, it closed at a price of 798 taels and 0.005 candareens. The daily trend was still flat. The morning was high and falling, the afternoon was falling and then rising, and finally, it was flatter. The trend was not very good, only pulled up by the Central Bank's opening of spot trading. The daily situation is recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The morning opened high due to the reverse drop in forward silver prices, American cotton, and stocks, at 800 taels and 0.009 candareens. Although the bank's opening was flat, there was a good sign. It initially fluctuated between one and one and a half candareens, as only goods and retail investors entered and exited each other. The goods hedged out strips at 0.01 taels. Wanxing and Cuichang came in, seeing an increase. The internal bank market once traded January American dollars at 0.9375 candareens, although it was matched, it felt better than the initial opening, rising to 0.023 candareens.

HSBC offered 0.0625 candareens for January American dollars. Hengyu sold down to within 9 candareens. This morning, it was already known that HSBC's posted prices would not change, so although Hengxing bought, there were many sellers, slightly struggling, still trending down. Zhifeng, Yongda, and Xingyong sold down to within 98 taels. Zhaofengchang issued strips, even reaching 7 taels, then slightly hovering up, as retail investors took profits to compensate, adding to 98 taels. Hengxing bought again, rising to 8.006 candareens, Hengyu then offered, retreating to around 8 taels. Fuyu slightly accepted, again at 8.006 candareens. The March American dollar had traded to 1.875, and the price became unsustainable. Daxingyong and Dadecheng sold strips without stopping, falling to within 7 taels. The May American dollar at 0.375 had no takers, seeing 95 taels and 0.006 candareens. Although Citibank entered the April American dollar at 0.3125, it sold February's 0.125, so the gold price also slightly lingered outside 6 taels. Hengyu and Yuanchun entered strips, at 7 taels. The Central Bank was again heard opening spot trading, at 97 taels and 0.005 candareens. The January American dollar at 0.0625 was willing to be sold by Meifeng, and the May 0.375 came from Bombay, and the market dropped again, hovering for a long time, finally closing at 796 taels and 0.007 candareens. The goods matched at the same price.</p>

Zhifengyong slightly entered, while the goods offered (goods price lowest 95 taels), fighting each other outside 6 taels. The Central Bank opened 140 strips of spot trading, which were done on behalf of Qianchangxiang, at a price of 96 taels. Zhifengyong entered again, and Hengxing followed to buy, at 7 taels. Fuyu successively bought to 97 taels and 0.004 candareens. Zhifengyong came to sell, hovering and falling to 6 taels and 0.002 candareens. Fuyu, Yuanmao, Yongda, and Decheng all entered, up over 2 candareens. Hengxing again accepted, breaking through 98 taels. Bombay telegraphed a drop of one anna, and the market rebounded. Yifengyong bought first. There was a rumor of the Central Bank opening 840 strips of spot trading, Dadecheng aggressively bought without stopping, Zhaofengchang and others also took the opportunity to enter strips, once reaching 800 taels. However, there were many sellers. Qingfayong dumped a great deal, Hengxing and Fuyu also successively sold off. The goods also continued to hedge out, gradually falling to 98 taels and 0.002 candareens. The exchange market also slightly tightened.

<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported that the New York stock market turned weak again on Wednesday (18th), and transactions were still slack. The drop in oil prices and the special weakness of several stocks, such as the Woolworth Department Store, the National Dairy Food Company, and the Marcy Department Store, were the reasons for the overall volatility of the stock market. According to a rumor, it is said that a certain investment trust company is afraid that the dividends of the above three stocks are unreliable, so it is secretly selling them. The total number of transactions on the whole day was 690,000 shares, and according to the estimate of the Iron Age magazine, the working of this week's iron is 16%, which is slightly better than the previous week. This is because the orders of various industries have slightly expanded. If the railway industry, the automobile industry, and the construction industry do not have a continuous need, the current production situation may be difficult to last.

<p>Zheng Biao's market opened in the early market, and the foreign cotton was sluggish and tired, and the firm energy of the previous day was exhausted again, and this month Chunji 4,000 dan had no intention of taking delivery, selling and falling, breaking through the 3 tael mark, and falling 5 cents in the far market, and the market was more relaxed in the afternoon, with an exclusive drop of 4 cents, and 5 fen and 32 and a half cents in the far market, and the total number of transactions on the whole day was 61,700, and it was found that Changfeng sold 3,000 dan, Yifeng sold 2,500 dan, Yuanda 1,100 dan, Mingde 1,200 dan, Shenchang 1,100 dan, Deji 1,300 dan, Xincheng bought 5,800 dan, Mingbei 2,500 dan, Jifeng 1,600 dan, Gengfeng 1,200 dan, Dachang 1,000 dan, Yukang 1,300 dan, Changhe 1,200 dan, the market price is</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton lacked buyers, and Liverpool news was unfavorable. Wall Street was buying, and the market was sluggish.  Futures fell by 9 to 13 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose 3 points, and spot prices rose 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 12 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but later weakened due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by speculators.  Pingguo’er rose 1.5 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi rose 2 rupees.

<p>Sales are sluggish except for glutinous rice, which saw a price increase of half a yuan.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai)  Yesterday, the weather turned warmer, and the ice in the inland rivers began to thaw, so rice boats arrived in Shanghai in succession, totaling more than 70. However, retail sales were still weak, and the market situation turned soft, with prices falling slightly.  There was a shortage of rice in Tongli, with prices opening at around 9 yuan and 45 cents.  Sutong and Changbang Nangang Qingjiao rice prices decreased slightly.  The season for Du Yangjian rice is approaching, and it is feared that there will be a shortage in the interior.  Yin Yuan rice was selling somewhat, so the market price was able to stand firm. Only Bian Yuan rice stood out, with a price increase of half a yuan, due to the temporary shortage.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai)  Yesterday, more than 20 boats of spot goods arrived from the river, but sales were very sluggish.  As the Lunar New Year is approaching, the stores are facing tight credit conditions, which has led to sluggish activity. The market for North Bang white japonica rice was slightly weak, and medium-grade white japonica rice fell by 20 cents.  There were not many arrivals of Yangxian rice, and retail sales were slightly active, with prices increasing by 10 to 20 cents.  There were no arrivals of Bai Yuan rice, and the price remained firm.  Du Xian and Yin Yuan were stable.  There were no arrivals of Bu Xian rice.  There were slight arrivals of late rice, and the price also fell by 10 to 20 cents.  Kexian rice remained firm.</p>
<p>(Outgoing)  The Shanghai Rice Industry Association has received a total of 330,000 bags of passports for both the North and South Seas, with about 70,000 bags for the South Seas and the rest for the North Seas.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Flour Market Plunges in the Afternoon <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a generally stable trend in the morning for all months. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat fell slightly by about 20 cents, the current flour supply was tight. Although there was no risk of a short squeeze for the current month, the bulls were unwilling to let go, so the prices for January and February were both tight, improving by about 1 cent compared to the previous day's closing price.  Long-term prices remained stable.  However, when the market opened in the afternoon, the market for all months suddenly took a sharp turn downwards.  It was heard that the pricing of Australian wheat by foreign firms suddenly loosened, with February shipments as low as 3 taels and 6 mace, and delivery in Nanjing was only 3 taels, 6 mace and 1 fen.  However, as the year-end was approaching, large and small factories were unwilling to trade. At that time, Fuxin also slightly sold off, so near-term and long-term prices both plunged step by step.  Given the continued oversupply of foreign wheat, changes should be guarded against in the future.  As a result, the current month fell by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, February fell by 2.75 fen, March fell by 2.5 fen, April fell by 1.25 fen, May fell by 1.75 fen, and June fell by a small amount.</p>
<p>Australian Wheat Prices Loosen</p>

<p>Yesterday was the last day before the market closed for the major year-end break. Activity was brisk, but market prices were low due to low foreign wheat spot and futures prices, and people were expecting declines. The price of Australian wheat for February shipments at 3 taels and 6 mace further influenced the market.  Sellers were even more active. Other bulls directly settled and took delivery of 500 tons of foreign wheat, which was acquired by Huafeng.  The closing price for wheat futures was slightly down by 2 fen for January, slightly down by 1 fen for February, slightly down by 5 fen for March, and slightly down by 3 fen for April. There were no transactions for the remaining months.</p>

<p>| Chen Xiao Rice Was Sold by Anli for 2,000 Bags |</p>
<p>(Kexian) Yesterday, both arrivals and sales of Kexian rice were sluggish. Although a few arrivals reached Shanghai, the owners intended to hoard and not sell, waiting for a favorable price in the red market after the New Year. However, sales were sluggish in all areas, as the end of the major closing period was approaching, and all parties in the local Kexian market intended to close their books. Only the Fuzhou and Quanzhou areas were still interested in trading, but they were not eager to buy, and were determined not to buy unless the price was low. Yesterday, 700 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice were cleverly sold in the market for 9 yuan, 1 jiao and 7 fen, or 3 li and 1 jiao. This price was slightly lower than the previous market price. The market price should have been above 9 yuan and 2 jiao. Due to the urgent need for year-end funds, the price was relatively cheap.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) There have been no transactions for a long time, because buyers and sellers have not been able to reach a price. Yesterday, Anli Foreign Firm suddenly sold 2,000 bags of old Xiao rice, which was acquired by the trader Guojin at a price of 8 yuan, which seemed to have risen slightly compared to the previous price. There was no intention to trade futures, for fear of repeating the losses of the previous year.</p>

<p>Chicago telegram on the 18th: Wheat first rose due to buying from the East, then fell due to weakness on Wall Street. A total of 20 million bushels were traded on the 17th. The market prices on the 18th are listed below:</p>

<p>The market is sluggish and shows a closing-down scene. Yesterday, the metal market was characterized by a lack of transactions from various dealers, showing a trend of closing down. Except for factories adding some new patterns, most of the transactions await the beginning of the Lunar New Year. As for the arrival of goods, dealers had already reduced their orders due to the year-end credit crunch, therefore, the supply of tinplate, white lead sheet, and new lead wire may be inadequate. It is predicted that prices will rise steadily in the coming days. Other items, such as new silver dollars, silver dollar heads, and silver ingots, are mostly declining due to oversupply. The prices of other foreign products do not show significant fluctuations.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai continued to be quiet. Most foreign dealers have been taking a wait-and-see attitude because the large batch of Fine Eyebrow tea cables sent out last week has not been responded to. Only the Tongfu Foreign Firm and China Tea Company bought 200 boxes of Wuzhuang Fine Eyebrow tea, with Wudong Fine Eyebrow tea priced at 58 taels, and Wubei Fine Eyebrow tea priced at 70 to 110 taels, with no price changes compared to the previous days. In addition, the large dealers also made scattered replenishments of Mei Xi tea produced by the Chinese tea factory. Otherwise, there were no transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the transaction volume of various types of bituminous coal and white coal in the coal market was quite large. However, the sales of various types of coal dust were particularly sluggish. Because factories were shutting down for the end of the lunar year, the purchase of bituminous coal dust was rare. The purchase of white coal dust was hampered by icy weather, and many suffered losses. Therefore, the industry was reluctant to purchase. The prices have loosened slightly. Fushun dust was 5 taels, Yuanshan dust was 5 taels, Gaowei dust was 5 taels and 5 mace, Jingxing dust was 10 taels, Huadong dust was 6 taels, Mac dust was 7 taels and 8.5 mace, and Haifeng dust was 7 taels and 7.5 mace.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Madman (2) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Er Lai Zi, after breakfast, still brimming with excitement, headed to the east village. Along the way, he could hear snippets about the reason Wang Lao Si had gone mad, as many were discussing this news. However, this seemed unnecessary to him. "Seeing is believing," he thought, "why not go straight to Wang Lao Si's house to find out the truth?" With his mind made up, Er Lai Zi hurried towards the dog-mother's place.</p>
<p>In Er Lai Zi's eyes, the village indeed felt different today. Wang Lao Si's doorway, for example, was packed with people; he couldn't recall seeing such a crowd except during Wang Lao Si's wedding years ago.</p>
<p>Er Lai Zi was too short. Even on tiptoe, he only reached an adult's shoulder. He struggled, pushing through people's armpits. He saw Wang Lao Si sitting there, picking lice. This disappointed Er Lai Zi; the so-called madman was no different from ordinary people. He still had that same beard, dirty and ugly, and Er Lai Zi suspected it was filled with lice eggs. He wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary, just picking lice and popping them into his mouth. What was most disappointing was that he wasn't talking. What was the point of a madman who didn't talk? Really, there was nothing to see.</p>
<p>Many slowly dispersed, seemingly not particularly thrilled. Only the children remained. Er Lai Zi naturally didn't want to leave immediately; perhaps there would be something interesting later.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the madman stood up. The children suddenly jumped and ran off. Er Lai Zi also ran, but then thought, "Ha, now the show begins."</p>
<p>The madman ran out of the door, running forward and shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"Come on, everyone follow me, let's burn the motherfucker's house down!"</p>
<p>Burn a house? Whose house? No one knew. But these were the words of a madman; who would believe him? So no one took it seriously. But Wang Lao Si kept running, and many children followed him, some women who weren't very old, the large group, with great momentum, it was quite a lively scene. Burn a house? Really burn it? That would be interesting. So everyone followed along to watch the excitement, even Dog-Mother, who rarely left her house.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, the madman Wang Lao Si stopped next to the ancestral hall. Of course, this was a new trick.</p>
<p>In the darkness of the ancestral hall's corridor, a pitifully thin old female dog was giving birth in a pile of dry grass. Two pups had already been born, their bodies covered in a greasy membrane. Another pup's head was already out, and the mother only needed one more push to bring it completely into the world. However, the dog was holding on to her last breath, and she didn't have the strength.</p>
<p>The madman was now staring at them, his eyes gleaming with a terrible ferocity, but the children were very happy. They saw the little lives moving slightly, clapping their hands and laughing innocently. Only the women knew the dog-mother's pain and felt great pity for the skinny dog.</p>
<p>"Oh! Maybe the little dog will never be born!..."</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>

<p>— Yang Chun</p>
<p>Ever since the fall of Yuguan and the tension at Shimen, we've been able to read in the newspapers generals' passionate telegrams expressing their readiness to fight. From those in power to those out of office, from army commanders to brigade commanders, telegrams fly back and forth in a flurry of activity, everyone eager to "not lag behind others in saving the country." Even the "Liu Family Generals," busy with street fighting and close combat, sent a telegram expressing their "cessation of internal warfare, ready to fight." Even General Liu Zhennian, known for his achievements in Yantai, telegraphed Beijing a few days ago, volunteering to lead his troops north to resist the Japanese. The central government, as always, responded to these passionate requests with "warm encouragement," or replies like "await further instructions." Especially for General Liu Zhennian, in addition to "warm encouragement," they also urged him to "strive for reconstruction." These responses echoed each other in perfect harmony, like listening to a deep bell.</p>
<p>Originally, to "resist" was said to be "long-term." The central government's true intentions, as clever as generals are, how could they not know? Knowing full well that their "volunteering" would not be "approved," they insisted on "volunteering" anyway. This way, they could create a false impression and show that they "do not lag behind others in saving the country," how wonderful! And as insightful as the central government is, they also knew the generals' intentions, and knew even better that even if their "volunteering" were "approved," the generals would never resolutely lead their troops north, so it was better to do a favor and send a warm, encouraging reply with a "!?!" This way, they could show that the central government had already planned, and also make the generals admire the central government's wisdom. Everything was unspoken, and the mutual understanding resonated with harmonious sounds throughout the nation!</p>
<p>However, besides a pair of ears, the people also have a pair of eyes that can see clearly! "What everyone sees, what everyone points at," the harmonious ensemble, the farcical duet, ultimately cannot anesthetize the people's souls!</p>
<h3 id="e252">Sickness <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Bing</p>
<p>I'm sick, I'm really sick now.</p>
<p>When a person is sick, their temper and mood are completely different from when they are well. Nothing can spark their interest, they have no hope, they can't even feel emotions for their closest relatives. There is only boredom, only depression, only thoughts of death, and the feeling that everything in the world is empty.</p>
<p>Ah, sickness, it's truly terrifying!</p>
<p>Rich people are not afraid of sickness. No matter what illness they have, they can be cured. They have money to stay in the hospital, money for surgery, money for medicine, money for injections, money for tonics. If they don't like the sanatoriums in Moganshan or West Lake in China, they can go to foreign countries in a flash, how carefree! But what about those who have no money? Not only can they not afford to see a doctor or rest, but they still have to work desperately. If they don't, what will they live on? No one wants to starve to death lying down!</p>
<p>Alas! What's the use of saying these useless words? I'm sick, but what can I do? Sick is still sick, isn't it?</p>
<p>It's too painful, really. I feel that nothing in the world is more painful than sickness! Beheading, shooting, these are momentary pains, but sickness, no matter how long it lasts, is always more painful than beheading or shooting. A healthy person lying in bed, unable to move, can only endure the pain. Thinking about the people outside laughing happily, walking vigorously, working hard at their jobs, beautiful hopes smiling and beckoning to them. But what about me? I can't do anything, I have nothing, I can only wait for the god of death to come and take me quietly to hell, as if I had taken sleeping pills.</p>
<p>However, that would be too cheap for my enemies if I really died of sickness.</p>
<h3 id="e253">On "Suicide" <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Cao Ruhui</p>
<p>In recent days, newspapers have been filled with news about suicide. Some are due to grief and anger about national affairs, some are due to economic hardship, and some are due to romantic desires. Some say that suicide is an act of courage, a beautiful destruction. Schopenhauer also said, "What's wrong with suicide?" I am absolutely against this view. I believe that suicide is an absolutely cowardly act, because those who commit suicide simply do not have the courage to face darkness and "cruelty," and especially do not have the determination to fight against "darkness" and "cruelty."</p>
<p>I think there should be two explanations for "life": one is "existence" and the other is "living." The former is without will and purpose, "existing in the world," while the latter is "living" with "vitality" and purpose. In this world, there are originally many people like walking corpses, like shadows, like ghosts, who only occupy a position in space and have absolutely no "vitality of life." They live only for enjoyment, for plundering the fruits of other people's labor. Such life is naturally worse than death. My view on such life is:</p>
<p>"A life like clinging leaves is not as good as a death like fallen flowers!"</p>
<p>What's more, their lives are not even as good as withered leaves, because withered leaves at least don't plunder the moisture and fertilizer of new leaves. If such lives were accelerated to death, I would naturally be twelve points in favor.</p>
<p>But most of those who commit suicide today are not well-fed walking corpses, nor are they devils who plunder the fruits of the labor of the masses, but are oppressed people, prisoners in the dungeons of darkness and cruelty. The oppressed and the prisoners have vitality, they are the supporters of the world, so they should not commit suicide, they should only fight! For themselves, for the people, for the future of history.</p>
<p>Why are national affairs in such a state? Why is life so pressing? Extending to unrequited love, heartbreak, etc., one should always ask "why"? This world is originally too dark, there are too many unexpected events, and there are only cries of pain, groans, hunger and cold, the wails of the weak and the songs of the strong echoing in space. But you must ask why is it like this? Why is this world dark? You should find a perpetrator? You should find an enemy? After being whipped by the devil, jumping into the Huangpu River, or drinking a cup of sleeping pills, is what kind of cowardice? I believe that only the brave can face darkness and cruelty, and only the brave can seek light from darkness and find happiness from cruelty. Suicide, why? For others? For yourself? The strong are sending out mocking and victorious laughs at your cowardly blood, and your death is enough to prolong the time of darkness. Madame Roland once said: "I will not commit suicide; if I commit suicide, I will kill a few villains first!" Here, I further affirm: "I will not commit suicide! I will resolutely fight against the darkness to the last moment of life!"</p>
<p>Only a death in struggle is a courageous death, a beautiful death, a meaningful and valuable death! Suicide, why? For yourself? For the people?</p>
<p>Therefore, I firmly oppose suicide! Because it is a bucket of cold water poured on the flames of struggle!</p>
<h3 id="e254">Artificial Snowflakes <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Nature can no longer proudly say: "I can create beautiful and mysterious snowflakes." Now, in fact, we can create snowflakes that are the same as those created by nature.</p>
<p>The first person to study this amazing phenomenon was John Mead Adams, a physics professor at the University of California. He made snowflakes by hand and observed their changes.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method is: first mix two kinds of air, one kind of air is dry and the temperature is below freezing, and the other kind of air is humid and the temperature is higher. When these two kinds of air are mixed, snowflakes are created and fall one by one. Finally, they fall into a small hole where they can be observed, and then a microscope is used to take pictures and observe the snowflake's organizational order.</p>
<p>When snowflakes are first formed, they are like a kind of crystal, and their diameter is only four ten-thousandths of an inch. Even if fifteen snowflake particles are arranged together, they are not as wide as a hair on a person's body. The simplest shape is a hexagonal prism, with the height and width almost equal. When the snowflakes increase in size, their shape remains unchanged until they reach more than ten times their original shape, and then they begin to change shape. Sometimes, when increasing in size, two snowflakes combine together to form a long prism, but its interior is empty, like a tooth that has been damaged by worms, or it forms a form that has ended.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah, Lin-xiansheng's palm is no different from a young girl's. Let me see. The fingers are so small and pointed!"</p>
<p>She naturally reached out to hold his hand. This seemed like a direct transmission of electricity. He felt infinite fluctuations in his entire body at that moment. At the same time, he also felt that he was facing an abyss, and he would soon fall into it.</p>
<p>Haiquan thought this way and quickly shifted his body, keeping a considerable distance from Hezi and others. He moved closer to the window and looked at the scenery outside.</p>
<p>"Lin-xiansheng!..."</p>
<p>She suddenly smiled and called him in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Eh."</p>
<p>"Why have you been so angry lately?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>He was a little embarrassed and replied, holding back a laugh.</p>
<p>"How can there be no? Not only does your face show anger, but you don't answer a single one of the dozens of questions people ask you.</p>
<p>Tell me the reason quickly! Otherwise, I won't let you off!"</p>
<p>Saying this, she was a little like a child, speaking with a spoiled tone.</p>
<p>"If there's no reason, how can I make one up?"</p>
<p>"Then I don't like it."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>He could only smile.</p>
<p>"Lin-xiansheng, you've been ignoring me completely this week, making me feel so sad."</p>
<p>Hearing that her voice was a little mournful, he quickly turned his head to look.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah!···············"</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Again it snows, a white shroud covering the entire earth, filling the poor with boundless dread. However, because "snow heralds a bountiful year," old scholars, cradling their pipes and stroking their beards, gaze upon the white landscape, filled with great hope; ["Perhaps next year will be another harvest? But Mencius said, 'A life of ease often ends in hardship,' alas!"] they sigh deeply.</p>
<p>Because the snow reflects silver light, the vast world, a dazzling sight, talents who create art for art's sake cannot help but be inspired. ["Ah! This sacred earth, I wish to be buried beneath it forever, eternally, forever dwelling in this ivory tower."]</p>
<p>Because the snow scene is enchanting, our sentimental young masters, of course, hold their beloved, speeding in cars across the snowy ground, their hearts ablaze with fiery passion; ["My love! Look, Heaven has adorned us with such beauty, how can we not enjoy it in time?"] A wild kiss, how sweet those crimson lips.</p>
<p>Because snowflakes, after all, bring a clear fragrance, and life offers few chances for appreciation, our esteemed committee members, amidst their protests and telegrams, cannot help but have their refined spirits stirred. They go to the park, to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, taking photos and filming scenes, and composing verses, undoubtedly masterpieces, both elegant and achieving fame.</p>
<p>Although the methods of enjoying oneself may differ, the leisurely mood is the same.</p>
<p>However, as the heavy snow falls, what of the patriotic heroes?</p>
<p>The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, clad in thin clothing and barefoot in the freezing snow, carrying saddles to keep warm, valiantly resist the enemy. Ultimately, lacking both support and supplies, they inevitably suffer defeat, death, or flight. Seeing the enemy deeply penetrating Yu (Liaoning), plundering North China, how can one not be heartbroken?</p>
<p>So, are the people in the rear truly without money to provide aid? How much is gambled away at a roulette table? How much does a fox fur coat cost? How much is spent on a Taoist ritual? How much is spent on grand weddings and funerals? So, is the government truly powerless to provide support? How much do guns, cannons, and bullets cost with each internal conflict? How many planes roar through the skies of the interior? How many soldiers "lie dead across the fields" and "blood flows like rivers," sacrificed in civil wars? How much is each compensation or state funeral fee issued to warlords? Therefore, it is not that they cannot, but that they will not.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time when the world is a blinding white and we... (incomplete sentence), we should not harbor any illusions. If we truly love China, we should shoulder our guns and rush to the front lines, organized and disciplined, to fight for the future of our nation!</p>

<h3 id="e257">Dyeing Cotton, Wool, and Silk Fabrics with Basic Dyes <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Neng</p>
<p>The dyeing of various fabrics such as cotton, wool, and silk has become an extremely important issue today, perhaps because of its extensive applications!</p>
<p>The earliest inventors of dyeing techniques were our Chinese ancestors! This can be verified by ancient history. Back then, emperors, kings, dukes, lords, and the common people of our country had different colors for their clothing. The prevalence of dyeing techniques at that time can be imagined. Unfortunately, each dynasty regarded industry as a lowly profession, adhering to old methods without seeking improvement, leading to the decline we see today!</p>
<p>In 1859, artificial dyes gradually developed, and dyeing techniques were influenced by this, becoming a branch of the chemical industry. From then on, chemical theories and scientific methods were used to research and improve dyeing, leading to the latest dyeing industry of today.</p>
<p>The above is some introduction to this article. Now we can get to the main text.</p>
<p>Several commonly used dyes in basic dye dyeing are as follows.</p>
<p>Red: Fuchsin Cerise Safranin</p>
<p>Yellow: Phosphine Auramine Chrysidine</p>
<p>Green: Malachite Green J</p>
<p>Blue: Aniline Blue Methylene Blue Induline</p>
<p>Purple: Methyl Violet Crystal Violet</p>
<p>Brown: Marron Bismarck Brown</p>
<p>The colors dyed with this type of basic dye are extremely vibrant. This dye can also be used to dye different materials together, resulting in unusually bright and harmonious colors. Unfortunately, it is not very resistant to light. Only two blue dyes, Laduline Methylene Blue, have strong light resistance.</p>
<p>When dyeing, it is not advisable to add the dye solution all at once; it should be added in two or three successive increments. Basic dyes should not be mixed with acidic dyes, as insoluble precipitates may occur, which will stain the fabric, and the resulting color will not be even. This should be noted.</p>
<p>Basic Dyeing Method for Cotton.</p>
<p>First, the cotton fabric should undergo mordanting treatment with acidic substances such as gallnut and catechu to make the color durable.</p>
<p>For the mordanting method, the cotton fabric can be soaked in hot water, wrung dry, and immersed in a solution of mordant. Let it sit for twelve to twenty-four hours, squeeze dry, and immerse it in a solution of antimony salt, such as tartar emetic. (This substance is easily soluble in water and requires the addition of a small amount of sodium carbonate to neutralize the free acid in order to preserve it.) Then, antimony tannate is formed, which is fixed to the fiber.</p>
<p>After being mordanted, the cotton fabric is immersed in a weakly basic dye solution and heated to 60 degrees Celsius. The fixed tannic acid reacts with the dye to form tannin antimony oxychloride, which has very strong adhesion, hence its excellent washing and soap resistance.</p>
<p>After dyeing, rinse with clean water. That's it. (The amount of dye and mordant is fixed and based on the weight of the fabric.)</p>
<p>Basic Dyeing Method for Wool.</p>
<p>This dyeing method does not require auxiliary agents and can directly dye the fabric, making it easy to obtain even colors.</p>
<p>During dyeing, the dye solution can be heated to around 30 degrees Celsius, and then the woolen fabric is immersed. Gradually increase the temperature to 80 degrees Celsius and keep it there for one hour before removing and cleaning it. This method should not use boiling hot dye.</p>
<p>Because wool absorbs color faster at high temperatures than at low temperatures, the resulting color gloss is inferior.</p>
<p>Adding a small amount of Marseilles soap to the dye solution can result in extremely vibrant colors. However, the dyeing temperature should not exceed 50 degrees Celsius. First, mix the soap with water and boil thoroughly, then filter out the resulting viscous foam before applying it, otherwise, the finished product will have mottled spots and stains, which is very unsightly.</p>
<p>Basic Dyeing Method for Silk.</p>
<p>Silk can also absorb basic dyes at room temperature, so its dyeing method is the same as that for wool fabrics. However, it is advisable to add raw silk soap (a soap solution containing dissolved sericin) to the dye solution to make the color more even. The dye solution temperature should not exceed 50 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>["What? Gang, are you injured? Where? ... Where?"] Yong sees his comrade Gang fall to the ground and roll around. He hurriedly puts down his gun and goes forward to help him.</p>
<p>["Alas! Yong!... Left arm."]</p>
<p>Yong lifts Gang's arm and rests it on his own thigh. Gang's arm has been blown into a hole, the bone seems to be broken! The flesh is a blur, and blood keeps gushing out. He hurriedly unties his leggings and bandages Gang's arm. Gang keeps groaning in pain.</p>
<p>["Yong!... Water,... my mouth is dry!"]</p>
<p>["The water's here! Open your mouth!"] Yong unties the military hot water bottle from his waist and pours it into Gang's mouth. Gang uses his right hand to take the hot water bottle.</p>
<p>["Do you feel better?"]</p>
<p>["Uh, alas! Yong! I didn't expect to be injured! Alas! Damned enemy, I must kill you all! Or, maybe I can't kill you all, but there are my many comrades and countrymen. There are 400 million countrymen, they will provide us with bullets and rations, but our weapons need to be improved. Just now the gun I was using hasn't been fired for long, but the firing pin got so hot that it was impossible to fire. Although we have enthusiasm and perseverance, we suffered a lot from the enemy because of this... Alas!</p>
<p>Alas!"] Gang groans in pain.</p>
<p>["Da, da, da... Clap! Clap!... Rumble! Rumble!"]</p>
<p>["Alas! Our government is always calm! Most countrymen are patriots in word only, saving the country on paper. I, Wang (?), can't say what kind of patriot I am, but at least in such a critical situation, I think that to save the country, one must come to the front line and fight the enemy to the death! Even more ridiculous are those so-called angry-at-the-country suicides. They are angry at the country and commit suicide, so the enemy returned the three northeastern provinces and retreated to the three islands? Why not bury their bodies on the battlefield? Perhaps, if they didn't die in battle, the enemy would be driven back by them? Ah! Alas!......"]</p>
<p>["Gang! You need to go to the rear to recuperate!"]</p>
<p>["No, I still want to fight! My right hand is not injured, and besides, I came here to sacrifice myself. It doesn't matter if I sacrifice myself, only after sacrifice can there be success. Yong, when you came here, weren't you holding a spirit of determination to die? This, I think, is the glory of the great Chinese nation, I hope that all countrymen have this determination!... Determination!...... Ah! Yong!... I... sacrificed myself,... I wish you..."] Gang tosses and turns, struggles until he is still.</p>
<p>["Gang! Hey! Gang! Ah, damned enemy, alas!"] Yong puts down Gang, picks up his gun, and goes forward.</p>

<p>| My House Experience |</p>
<p>One evening, we decided to move. Because this small front building could no longer accommodate all of us—my old brother, Lao Wang, and Mr. and Mrs. Zhang. Naturally, the first to propose it was my old brother, because my old brother was the leader of our group. He spent all his time writing manuscripts, and recently, because of the addition of more people, he really couldn't sit comfortably. Moreover, the landlady downstairs often gambled on roulette and mahjong and lost her temper, crying loudly in the middle of the night. We all felt very inconvenient. After my old brother proposed it that night, Lao Wang and I immediately seconded him. We immediately decided to set off early the next morning to look for a house. We assumed the French Concession in the west as our area, a pavilion room on the first floor as our target house, and twenty-five yuan per month as our standard rent.</p>
<p>The next morning, after everyone finished chewing on fried dough sticks, we only left Mrs. Zhang to watch the house. The four of us jumped on the tram and marched mightily to the French Concession. We were all from out of town, and everything was "inexplicable." My old brother was more experienced, so he led the way. Walking to the corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Cardinal Luling, my old brother picked up his glasses and saw a rental advertisement on a telephone pole in the right corner. He called Lao Wang to go over and take a look, but it turned out to be a red paper strip for "serious cold for sale." Although there was a "rent" sign next to the red paper strip, it did not meet the "target house" principle. Looking at another one, he rushed in regardless of everything. A very beautiful Russian young woman came out and greeted us in fluent English. My old brother also spoke to her in broken English, but the Russian woman ignored my old brother and kept looking at Lao Wang, who was wearing a western suit. Lao Wang, who was usually eloquent, was so anxious that he was like an ant on a hot pot. He simply couldn't speak a word of English. Later, we learned that the rent was more than forty-five taels, so we turned around and ran away. From then on, we didn't know how many roads we walked, how many alleys we went through, how many times we knocked on doors, how many flights of stairs we climbed, how many kinds of languages we heard, how many kinds of strange shapes we saw, and how many kinds of smells we smelled. In this way, we didn't return home until late at night, still "unintelligible," only to get a cold laugh from Mrs. Zhang.</p>
<p>The next day, the third day, we continued to work hard, but we learned a lesson from experience. We realized that it was more convenient to have the pretty-boy Lao Wang lead the way, so my old brother had to take a backseat. We kept looking, but we kept finding nothing. Although we felt the sadness of disillusionment, we also had comfort; because in order to find a house, we had inspected the general family situation of Shanghai society. Mr. Zhang even brought a small notebook and recorded the experience in it at any time. Curious interest encouraged us, and we simply forgot our purpose. We were no longer anxious, without worries. In the past three days, we probably found thirty-two houses. These thirty-two houses generally met our ideals, but no one met the standard rent. According to Mr. Zhang's statistics;</p>
<p>More than forty-five yuan three More than forty-five taels one</p>
<p>More than forty yuan five</p>
<p>More than thirty-five yuan eight</p>
<p>More than thirty yuan fifteen</p>
<p>Total thirty-two</p>
<p>The most common number was thirty-four or five yuan, but this number was really too far from our standard, we could only sigh! Even when we were sighing, we were scolded by the young ladies. Even so, the secret rooms and caves of [Shanghai families] gave us a pleasant tour, Yanhua Cave, Zhulin Fang, and brothels, it seemed that we had all seen them. People from all over the country were there, but Southerners, especially people from Suzhou, were the most numerous (this naturally only applies to those who contacted us directly). According to statistics;</p>
<p>Suzhou people thirteen</p>
<p>Ningbo people eight</p>
<p>Shanghai people seven</p>
<p>Jiangbei people two</p>
<p>Beijing people one</p>
<p>Russian people one</p>
<p>Total thirty-two</p>
<p>Among them, somehow, women were the most numerous, this was a fact. But this was also a truly incredible fact. Mr. Zhang's statistics book says;</p>
<p>Young girls or women thirteen</p>
<p>Middle-aged women five</p>
<p>Old women three</p>
<p>Middle-aged men three</p>
<p>Young men one</p>
<p>Children or maids two</p>
<p>Men and women interviewed together five</p>
<p>Total thirty-two</p>
<p>This was really something we didn't expect. In three days, we would see so many different kinds of women? Barefoot, wearing slippers, disheveled, heavily made-up, smoke-filled. Please see the statistical table; (we met 26 women, see the table above)</p>
<p>Smoke-filled two</p>
<p>Heavily made-up five</p>
<p>Barefoot wearing slippers ten</p>
<p>Disheveled two</p>
<p>No characteristics seven</p>
<p>Total twenty-six</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, it can be seen that heavily made-up women almost accounted for one-half, while [disheveled] [smoke-filled],... also accounted for one-third. Disheveled hair and slippers showed the development of laziness, and smoke-filled faces showed the growth of decline, while heavy makeup, then [I don't know!].</p>
<p>In short, we looked for a house for three days, although we didn't find it in the end, and we are still crammed in the front building, but we have toured the middle-class families of the big city. The family is the most basic unit of society, the dozens of small societies we have [toured] for three days are really the shadow side of society!</p>
<p>If the reader doesn't believe it, you might as well go [tour] it! 1.13! Under the lights</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Since your newspaper added the Shop Clerk Correspondence, our generally ignorant shop clerks can get considerable answers to difficult questions. This is really the gospel of society! I now have two questions about natural science to ask you.</p>
<p>Gold is obtained from sand or granite by panning or amalgamation. It does not contain toxic substances. Why does swallowing it cause death? And why can taking sheep neck bone charcoal allow it to pass safely out of the anus? What is the reason for the death, and what is the action of taking sheep neck bone charcoal?</p>
<p>Snow is formed by the condensation of water vapor when it encounters cold weather. This is true for winter snow, and it is no different for spring snow. But why do we welcome winter snow and hate spring snow? (The following is omitted)</p>
<p>Zhu Cinian</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After a person swallows gold, because the nature of gold is very heavy, it often stagnates in the intestines, leading to intestinal rupture and death. The small amount of gold leaf in our country's pills and powders will not kill people; and swallowing a large amount of metals other than gold will also lead to death; Ming is proof. It is not caused by toxic emissions, so the solution is simply to excrete it safely from the anus with the stool. There is no need for detoxification. It is found that bone charcoal (not limited to sheep neck bone) originally absorbs water in the intestines, making it extremely dry and increasing the ability to peristalsis to promote excretion. However, the power is too small and cannot have a ten-thousand-in-one grip. Zhu Jun, where did you get this method? We believe that when encountering a person who swallows gold, sending them to the hospital for treatment is the safest way!</p>
<p>Snow is a crystal formed by the condensation of water vapor encountering sudden cold. It is true that winter snow is the same as spring snow, but in winter, all the winter crops in the fields, their vitality is hidden in the underground roots, and the resistance is very strong; at the same time, the vitality of insects that harm crops and the eggs they leave behind is very weak. Therefore, winter snow does no harm to crops and can kill pests, but it is different in spring. The potential of plants develops outward, the branches and leaves sprout, and the resistance decreases accordingly; at the same time, the life of pests has turned, so spring snow not only cannot kill pests, but is enough to destroy crops. This is why we welcome winter snow and hate spring snow.</p>

<p>["A child who is only fifteen years old this year, alas!"] Boss Sang took off his flower glasses, held the back of his head with both hands, sat on the rattan chair, letting the newspaper scatter on both sides of the chair, ["What does he know! His mother tells him to go east, he doesn't dare go west, how dare he resist his mother, their whole family can't stand him, it's just because he's getting older and gradually understands human affairs, keeping him at home may be inconvenient for me, so I have to take this harsh measure."]</p>
<p>["I don't think Mao Sheng is a bad kid. Now they've kicked him out. Who can he rely on? It's really pitiful!"] The boss's wife shook her head slightly, expressing her inability to help.</p>
<p>Several tailors echoed the boss's wife's opinion, whispering to each other, and some even cited several virtues of Mao Sheng to prove that the boss's wife's judgment was correct.</p>
<p>["At this time!"] The tailors heard Boss Sang speak, and immediately stopped discussing and listened respectfully. Only those who are rich and powerful, their farts are fragrant, and the poor can only stare with both eyes and watch them do whatever they want! What's the use of your anger?"]</p>
<p>There were footsteps inside the wall door, and the people in the tailor shop were silent. The folding screen door opened inside with a "ya" sound, and a fashionable young man came out. His clothes were very neat and fashionable, the upper part of his face, his eyebrows and eyes were very delicate, and below hung an eagle claw nose, matched with a thunder god's mouth, and two serpent patterns slightly upturned, his face often with a smile. He walked out of the tailor shop and stood there, and a brand new private car backed up and stopped at the door to pick him up, and the driver strode out of the alley.</p>
<p>Boss Sang glanced at him sideways, and waited for the young man to go far away before sitting up and whispering to the boss's wife; ["Hey! Isn't he Lao Wu? Why is he coming out so early today? Did you see what time he came?"]</p>
<p>The tailors on the platform all smiled lightly, as if telling the boss, ["We can solve the doubts you have, but we don't want to cover the boss's wife's head." The boss's wife looked at the boss, seeming to grade [test], smiled, (to be continued)</p>

<p>Movie Special</p>
<h3 id="e263">The Production Process of Grand Hotel <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>(Below) The Book Account of Lionel Barrymore</p>
<p>This film also shows that Grast able to tell jokes. One day when Menno Val came to the photography farm of "Grand Hotel" to visit her, she had not yet arrived. This day, the "Grand Hotel" was filming the room of her room, so the electric door was put into a tree in a dress that released this hope. Later, Jia arrived and began rehearsals. She performed in an angry manner, while others were ambushing nearby waiting for Nova Luo to perform his drama.</p>
<p>The door of the clothing tree suddenly opened, and Jia was taken aback.</p>
<p>"Okay, are there any more people running out?" Jia asked, undoubtedly thinking of the old car of KeystodeKopo.</p>
<p>Just as we expected, there are many humorous places in this film. Jia sang a German song in this film, called IchLiebeDich, she used to sing this song Wu recalled for tuning to restore her memory. So I equipped her with a zither and a pianist.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford plays the role of a secretary, and in several scenes, she has to perform typing. Joan at home dedicated to a typewriter. Because she wanted to perform realistically, and only a certain typewriter could make her work like this. So the company found a new one for her and rented it to her.</p>
<p>At that time, John Barryham was very fond of several books brought out by the supply department. This was probably because these old-edition ancient books were the green reason he was collecting. He got the book he wanted. The price was paid unknowingly by his brother Lionel, because when the supply department asked him whether the book price should be put on the account. He was angry and said,</p>
<p>"No, I don't have any dealings with the company, my brother has a good account."</p>
<p>"Why do I have this book account?" Lionel roared in surprise a few days later "I have never bought a book."</p>
<p>"Aha, yes, you bought it," said his brother John "Bought it for me."</p>
<p>Lionel had to spend an hour every day transforming into the role of Kinking, the short and sickly German who was determined to get rid of his last moment in the "Grand Hotel".</p>
<p>Because, as already mentioned above, in this film, the "Grand Hotel" itself occupies the most prominent position and surpasses all the actors. All the actions are performed in the hotel. Everyone's life is subdued by the influence of the Grand Hotel, so when a waiter in a wine bar mixes a drink, when a maid tidies up a room, they are equally important.</p>
<p>In order to make this hotel detailed and without delay, there are no trivial matters left or flaws revealed. The instructions on each reception room are in German. The telephone office has the Berlin telephone office, that is, the flowers and plants in the flower shop are also arranged according to the latest pointed style in Berlin.</p>
<h3 id="e264">The Contribution of Film to Science <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Film certainly holds a very important position in science. The “Trip to the Moon,” produced by the Bird Company after two years of painstaking effort, is one example. According to the measurements of Professor Oberth of the University of Berlin, the distance between the Earth and the Moon is 1,343,520,000 meters. Thus, inventors have based their new theories on inventing rockets that can fly 11,200 meters per second, allowing humans to explore the Moon. "Trip to the Moon" depicts this great feat, and many of the fantastic images of space are not seen in other films. It is said that it will soon be released in Paris. I believe it can give them some new scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e265">Review of "Northeast Volunteer Army: A Bloody War History" <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Produced by Jinan Film Company</p>
<p>Premiered at the Beijing Grand Theatre</p>
<p>This is another film about the actual battles of the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in China today, films that encourage the people to fight for the nation are not at all too many. What harm would there be in having a few more?</p>
<p>Furthermore, "Northeast Volunteer Army: A Bloody War History," which was recently screened at the Central Theatre, was produced by Nine Star Company and is essentially the same type of work as this film. However, the advertisement at the Beijing Grand Theatre included the phrase "Beware of Imitations." I wonder what the need for this is?</p>
<p>Regarding the technical aspects of this film, it is necessary to say a few words. Although filming on the front lines is inherently difficult, there is little possibility of paying attention to technique. The editing of this film is comparatively "systematic," but it lacks the power of "contrast," and the enemy's brutality is also rarely exposed. In other words, it does not more clearly show the arduousness of the Volunteer Army's combat. The lighting is not clear enough, which is naturally because lighting cannot be used on the battlefield, but the film stock is also a major factor. Due to the small company's lack of capital, the equipment is not sophisticated, and the camera shots appear dull and inflexible. The subtitles are too blurred, and what the subtitles tell the audience is only a narrow national concept, without further grasping the greater national significance. In fact, the entire subject matter neglects the demands of the vast majority of people who are directly trampled under the iron heel of imperialism.</p>
<p>However, we should forgive it one hundred and twenty percent. In such difficult work, being able to achieve such results is already enough to satisfy us. Moreover, this is an anti-imperialist film. Therefore, I still, like after watching Nine Star Company's "Northeast Volunteer Army: A Bloody War History" (please refer to yesterday's film review in this publication), advise the people of Shanghai to use the money they would spend on other films to see this film, to understand the suffering of our weak nation with the interest of cinematic entertainment, and to resolutely strive for the future of our Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Statement of Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e266">News of the Current Situation That Should Be Disseminated on the Silver Screen <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>Foreign invaders are penetrating deep, and the national crisis is increasingly urgent. We, the people in the rear, still have enough to eat, enough to wear, and even enough entertainment. Therefore, some people say that the people in the rear are indulging in entertainment and have simply forgotten the endangered state... There are also some people who defend entertainment, saying... "Entertainment does not forget saving the country, saving the country does not forget entertainment," such as the New World's charity performance to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army this time, which embodies the meaning of saving the country in entertainment. I believe that both opinions have considerable reasons. Those who talk loftily about saving the country do not necessarily have to be hostile to entertainment, because on the one hand, engaging in serious work to save the country, and on the other hand, engaging in a very small amount of relaxing entertainment, cannot really be considered inappropriate. If soldiers on the front lines sing operas and chat in the trenches after charging and fighting at close quarters, we shouldn't call their actions insane, should we?</p>
<p>One day, I was watching a movie at a certain cinema. After about an hour of screening, there was a ten-minute break as usual, and then the screening continued... But before the screening, shockingly projected on the screen was a piece of alarming news, writing... "Jiukou has fallen, and many of our soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured. Our army is currently deploying defenses at a certain location, making a firm defense." Everyone in the theater sighed incessantly upon seeing this news. When everyone was fully focused on the plot of the film, suddenly came a piece of news about the national crisis, as if everyone had taken a refreshing medicine! I believe that if cinemas can take advantage of such opportunities to inject news of the current situation and news of the national crisis into the hearts of every viewer in such a clever way, this matter is worthy of praise and encouragement!</p>

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Tang Xiaodan, a native of Fujian, is 24 years old, possesses fine features, and is a young and promising youth. In his early years, he studied in Japan, delving into aesthetics and architecture, both of which he mastered well. After returning to China, he held a position at Shanghai China Commercial Art Advertising Company, and his reputation grew. For a time, people flocked to him to design architectural patterns and advertising artwork. During the "January 28th" Incident last year, Shanghai became a war zone, and the company happened to be located in the war zone, sacrificing itself for the national crisis. Mr. Tang then joined Tianyi Film Company as the director of set design, creating novel and magnificent structures, delicate Tang palaces, opening up a new record in the history of Tianyi Film Company. The Shao brothers, owners of the company, value him more than ever, regretting that they did not meet him sooner.</p>
<p>Recently, Xue Juexian, a well-known Cantonese opera actor, established the Southern Film Company in Shanghai in cooperation with Tianyi Film Company to film "Platinum Dragon," and Mr. Tang is serving as the director of this film. We hope that this artist will become a famous director in the future.</p>

<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>"Dragon Soaring, Phoenix Dancing" was once popular at the Cameo Theater. I think that those who should appreciate this film will appreciate it. The film's [unclear], technology, and are all top-notch, and the style is naturally different from American films. The lyrics sung in the film are especially touching and linger in the mind, so I have excerpted two sections to introduce them.</p>
<p>Am I crying, or am I laughing?</p>
<p>Am I dreaming, or am I awake, not awake;</p>
<p>What I'm doing today, I don't even know!</p>
<p>Walking is not right, standing is not right;</p>
<p>People are always laughing at me!</p>
<p>Could it be that all ideals are realized today!</p>
<p>I think I'll know in a while.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Too bad there's only this one today,</p>
<p>It will never come again!</p>
<p>Because this ideal reality,</p>
<p>Is too noble and beautiful!</p>
<p>It's as if a golden light shines down on our heads from the palace, isn't this rare!</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Too bad there's only this one today, it will never come again; maybe it's a dreamlike mood! Life only has this one moment, tomorrow may fly away with time! Ah! Life only has this one moment, like the best of spring in two years is only in May!</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Every couple believes in an ideal...</p>
<p>"Love is sacred and eternal."</p>
<p>But you must remember...</p>
<p>"Please shake hands in farewell!"</p>
<p>Then you will know that the blue sky is not as good as it used to be.</p>

<p>According to an American Broadway film magazine... In the whole year of 1931, there were thirty-seven stars who got married in Hollywood. In the first nine months of last year, thirty-four of them and their wives or husbands went to court for divorce, planning to make new connections. Marrying and divorcing, what does it all mean to them!</p>
<p>After completing "Blonde Venus," Marlene Dietrich disappeared. Even the most well-informed reporters could not find her踪跡. Some spread rumors that she had been abandoned by her husband, and some even said that she had gone to Germany. But now news has come that Marlene hid because she was filming "Song of Songs" without Von Sternberg as her director.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin has long had the intention of filming a Napoleon film, but as time goes by, his depiction of this film seems to be under even more careful consideration. In fact, he is now telling several close friends that he will no longer make comedies. Therefore, many people believe that he will start filming sound films.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Child Star Li Keng <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Qing</p>
<p>Among the general movie stars in our country, the most lacking talent is child actors. Zheng Xiaoqiu is now the mainstay of the Star Film Company's leading men, but the golden age of Er Chun [unclear]—the most prosperous time of martial arts films—has also passed. This Chinese Jackie Coogan-like figure has not yet emerged.</p>
<p>In the Lianhua Film Company's film "Humanity" last year, we discovered a brilliant talent—Li Keng, who was highly praised by the audience. He is only five years old this year, speaks fluent Cantonese, and is innocent, lively, and exceptionally cute. He is the beloved son of Li Minwei, the head of the Lianhua Film Company's first studio. Since "Humanity" was released, he will soon be filming "Childhood China," starring him. His Mandarin pronunciation is also very accurate. The Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road once invited him to sing on the radio.</p>

<h3 id="e271">High-Heeled Leather Shoes and Military Maps in "Adventures in the War Zone" <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Yuhong</p>
<p>I deeply know that there are many areas where the Chinese film industry has its hardships, where the will is there but the strength is not enough, so film critics should also be understanding and not overly critical. However, small details within the realm of possibility should also be paid attention to. For example, in "Adventures in the War Zone," there seem to be two points that are not in line with reason:</p>
<p>Because Ding Mingxia ventured into the war zone, she changed into a villager's outfit. However, when she was imprisoned and voluntarily surrendered, after taking off her long old cloth socks, a pair of high-heeled leather shoes suddenly appeared. This seems inexplicable! It is impossible to wear high-heeled shoes with long old cloth socks and then wear men's shoes. If you say they were temporarily found in the bandit camp, that is also unreasonable.</p>
<p>Ding Mingxia's stolen military map is a major key to the entire drama, but we need to know what kind of map she stole? I can swear that what she stole was a very ordinary map of China, which is also unreasonable. It would be a great joke to plan a military action in a certain place on a very ordinary map of China. Moreover, Ding Mingxia stole it back with great difficulty, and the officials praised each other and regarded it as a great achievement!</p>
<p>The above two points are not nitpicking on practical matters. I wonder what the director thinks?</p>
<h3 id="e272">Dimples and Smiles <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The beautiful dimples on either side of a woman's lips are called dimples. Also called smiles. Although the names are different, the intention is actually the same. Pears are sweet and juicy. Wine is fine wine, and in general, both are lovely and delicious. On the 16th of this publication, I saw Yuan Jun's contribution and felt that Hu Shan's words and speech had the flavor of competing with her older sister Hu Die for dimples. In fact, dear sister, don't compete, because there are two ways to say that beautiful dimple. Let's just call them... pear dimples Die, smile dimples Shan, okay. In this way, not only will each have a unique banner, which can make people pay special attention, but also there is a concept of standing side by side and achieving eternal fame! I wonder if other stars, such as the three Liang sisters, have any common characteristics? I must ask all the viewers to pay more attention!</p>

<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>Antoniu Skarazzi</p>
<p>319 rue de Rochechouart, Paris</p>
<p>One day a fishing boat towed into the harbor of a small island in the Baltic Sea. A man ran down from the boat, a small Italian man with a cunning look on his face. The fishing boat unloaded the guest and sailed away. After the man waited for the boat to leave, he picked up a small path and walked towards an empty summer house. When he arrived, he knocked on the door. The door was opened by Paul Kreuger. He opened the door, pulled the man inside, and the door closed tightly again.</p>
<p>"Do you want to buy some important documents from me?" the Italian asked.</p>
<p>"Let me see them first," Paul said. "There's no one else here." Paul saw the Italian pull out a rubber-coated bag from his side.</p>
<p>"Here are fifty Italian government treasury bonds," he slowly opened the bag, "each with a face value of one million." He placed them in Paul's hand.</p>
<p>"Sir, this is as good as the real thing, or even better," he said, his cunning gaze fixed on Paul's eyes. "Sir, how many do you want?"</p>
<p>"I want all fifty," Paul said decisively.</p>
<p>The Italian was suddenly surprised beyond his expectations when he heard this. He thought an opportunity to rip someone off had come. Moreover, with this large amount of fake bonds in his possession, he had a hold on him, and he could look for him at any time, a truly good customer to eat from for life.</p>
<p>Paul looked at the Italian and smiled strangely.</p>
<p>"Skarazzi, I'll pay you five thousand dollars now to show my sincerity in doing business with you. The rest of the money will be paid in Paris tomorrow. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"Very good, very good, sir," the Italian replied.</p>
<p>Paul took out his wallet, pulled out five one-thousand-dollar bills, and the Italian received them, inspected them repeatedly, nodded, and put them away.</p>
<p>"I'll take you ashore by the way," Paul said to him. "It shouldn't be difficult for you to enter Sweden, right?" He asked casually on purpose. Skarazzi laughed.</p>
<p>"I issue my own passport and sign my own name. No one knows I've entered Sweden."</p>
<p>In Paul's eyes, a strange light shone. He couldn't be more satisfied. What he wanted to know was that no one knew he was in Sweden.</p>
<p>The two of them stepped into the speedboat together. With money in hand, Skarazzi sat happily and openly at the stern of the boat, which sped through the waves like lightning. Suddenly, Paul Kreuger turned the wheel – Skarazzi cried out, rolled into the water, waves splashed everywhere, and the man was nowhere to be seen. Kreuger didn't even turn his head to look and continued to speed away. He went ashore very peacefully by himself.</p>
