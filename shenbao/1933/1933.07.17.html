<p>時評</p>
<h3>移軍實邊與開發西北明</h3>
<p>孫殿英所部近奉命開赴靑海屯墾在察局未了結之際此種行動殊値得國人注意溯自民國紀元二十二年以來國内一般軍人祇知剝民自肥。罔顧國利。遭遇九一八嚴重之國難面後。并引起徹底覺悟。如四川軍閥一年半以還。内戰已經三次。二劉戰矣。劉鄧戰矣。今則渝劉又與劉文輝開衅。而對於富庶之川康邊疆。則絕不肯出其一二分之力量。以從事於開闢。蓋邊疆之無人顧問也久矣。</p>
<p>開兵赴靑海之議。屢有人倡之。然迄未見諸實施。孫殿英氏所部。原非極堅强軍隊。對於近代國之意識。亦未必十分充分。而此次竟能接受中央命令。整裝待發。吾謂此説果成事實。則京光明方面而論。在此萬方多難期間。能不爭私利而屯墾邊陲。實爲不可多得之軍隊。其意義第一爲純消費之軍隊。（實際我國軍隊。匪特消費。而且騷擾人民）一經轉化。可成爲國家建設前途之中心動力。而爲農業生產者。第二靑海現仍滯留於牧畜時代。經此開發。必能推退至於農業社會。於甘陝諸省。皆有莫大之惠益。第三西北邊防。已極吃緊。西藏之離心傾向。尤極顯著。孫氏此去。於國防上亦負有重大使命。設能黽勉將事。則失之東隅者。未始不可收之於西北也。</p>
<p>不過就　海方面觀察。强隣圖我正亟。地方之團結不固。設無懷來遠人之策略。則一旦大軍所至。將更激動强隣之進一步窺伺。同時併挑動邊人之疑懼非持治邊之效難收。即原有之形勢。亦恐不易維持。况靑海新疆同爲回漢雜處之區。又有他敎參雜其間。民族與宗敎錯綜關聯。向不似其他社會經濟一般狀態之簡單。故政治上問題。尤須縝密審愼。以求解决。方能談到屯墾。方能在此一片草莽中開拓土地也。</p>
<p>開發西北。在今日誠爲打開國難之唯一有效方法。然而事實上我國最發達之省區。如蘇浙粤閩等省。其近代工業組織。尙未充分完備。即有少數工業經濟之組織。亦多爲輕工業。於眞正爲工業及集體農業動力之鋼鐵機械之製造。尙無所聞。欲開發邊疆。實力殊嫌單薄。且此種事業。絕非某一部分之人力財力所能勝任。必政府先有整個計劃。集中人力與財力。兼顧國防與省防。夫然後乃能推進政治之效率。邊境如靑海等省。乃可由牧畜經濟。進而着手於近代產業之建設。若不注意於此。而僅欲藉孫殿英一軍之力。以當此大任。縱孫氏立志若何堅定。行動若何奮迅。其結果恐亦徒勞而已。</p>

<p>「各位先生、處於目前一般經濟限於最深衰落的時候、我禮候你們在這裏具有最深負責的精神、我相信、自有世界歷史以來以、君主而當世界會議開會致祝詞的任務、今天就是第一次吧、我祝這樣的一種會議必能滿我之意、和不負我的期望、而能造成善果、我也特别致候國際聯盟會會員國代表諸君、我對於國際聯盟會的工作、常以最深意味和寳重加以留意、此會係由國聯負責所召集而成、並且本會議大綱也是由國聯專家委員會經過很深刻的研究貢獻出來、的</p>
<p>如果没有國聯和國聯的理想、能否開得成這樣偉大的世界會議嗎、我是很大的懷疑、我對於非國聯會員國來此參加世界經濟會的代表、也致同樣誠意的禮候、我是承認人類有合作互助的勇義精神、這種精神使得你們非國聯會員國的代表、今天也同樣熱烈地來參與此次世界經濟會議、其次我也特别向來自我不列顚帝國領地和印度國的代表表示禮候、</p>
<p>各代表先生們、我看到這一次以整個世界的領域而構成的代表大會、實有無限感想和極大緊張、這個會是代表全世界的希望和祈禱、世界目前正是處於一種不安狀態、對於各位代表先生們、從今天開始就是應該設法恢復世界的安定常態、這種使命當然是困難、你們祗有以善意和最嚴重的合作才能完成你們的使命、</p>
<p>各位代表先生們、我以我的手授於先生們、並以整個心底期望希冀以你們的努力和功勞、將使整個世界各民族所願達和不能再忍的幸福的事件、導於實現和成功、我雖已完全認識這次會議的偉大使命了、但是事實上還有一種眞正的象徵願望、深祝此會將能一心一德與一志、各國現在都是患着同樣的大病、此病即爲失業工人人數的日增月長、失業人數的意義及其對於人類引起的苦痛反響、我在近數年來是無時無刻不加以擔憂和考慮的、此種憂慮在各負政府責任的代表諸君、自有同一的意識、</p>
<p>爲了目前世界共同認識的恐慌危險、我要向全世界大聲疾呼、請大家要共同合作努力工作、以求得此後世界的最大安寗、除去世界人類的力量、是不能補救物質進步的障碍、所以我爲恢復此後世界安定計、我們就要由我們共同的力量作出發、反之現代的發明和新大陸的發現、和生產超於需要的可能的組織、又是造成無數多的新困難問題、更由於這些驚人物質進步所使到各國互相發生連帶的從屬影響、同時亦即形成各民族間合作的必要與新認識現在時候已到、此種人類共同利益的新意識可使其盡量利用、然而當基於一種信條、即雙方表示爲達本會會議正當磋商的第一步驟、</p>
<p>我是很願意和代表諸君作詳細的談話、交換意見、但是我的最急迫的希望、深望你們工作的結果、能再渡世界入於安定榮繁、和遵循正當常軌向前進步」、</p>
<p>跟著英皇的祝詞、便有大會主席英相麥克唐納的開塲白、他的開塲白大意説、「目前本會的使命係非常重要而偉大、我們須要這個會議能對世界有空前未有的獨立説話的權威、在近數年來、世界商業的衰落慘狀、爲有史以來所未見、這種不景而且危及全人類生活的病狀、我們决不能任牠延續下去、戰債問題我們在此次會議也要當作最重要的問題、爲之恊謀磋商、而且必要打破一切障碍而求其最後的解决、洛桑條約對於戰債的規定係一種理論結果、此種條約我們無論如何不能破敗牠、却是應該和必要努力求其完善化才行、年來世界上流行一種所謂國家自足的經濟政策、他認爲這樣的經濟政策不獨對世界無益、實則祇有會使到人類貧苦化、他相信世界越快能夠做到一個經濟單位、那就越發有利於世界各國、但總之他認爲國際合作是可致各國榮繁的唯一路徑、他對起草大會議和的專家委員會表示非常感謝、他説、本會在此討論的義務、第一要緊的事體是在求各代表國家政府的負責任和採一致共同行動問題、此中各政府尤以怎樣解决各國工業政策和世界工業政策較爲重要、他認爲今後世界有無轉機和改善國際關係的可能、全靠此次大會的動作、他深信赴會代表諸君都有熱心努力以謀解决世界問題的眞誠、所以預祝本會前程必能獲得爲世界全民所共同期望的良好結果」云云、詞長萬言、痛快淋漓而悲壯、塲會内置有播音機、其波浪力可及於全世界、全地球二十億人皆可領受麥氏演詞、豈徒麥氏個人榮幸、抑亦世界之新福音也、演辭皆以英法文同時轉譯、</p>

<h3>碼頭哭聲</h3>

<h3>會議善後</h3>
<p>劉鴻生昨晨在本宅、與高司長船務科正副主任、並被難高級船員姜長慶等六人、於聽取姜等報告後、即恊議此案善後辦法、及向日方交涉進行手續、至十二時半始散、姜船主等、當赴駕駛會午餐、記者亦在座、姜君言圖南輪今次被難、其迅速與慘狀、、實爲前所未有、一撞之下、即兩段下沉、三四分鐘、船即没海、不但救濟工作、不及施行、即欲逃生、亦所不及、誠航界罕有之大慘劇也、</p>
<h3>撞船狀况</h3>
<p>據圖南船主姜長慶·大副孫作人·語記者、圖南輪于本月十日淸晨一時半、開過山東最危險最難駛之成山角海灣、海面有霧、但本船並無事故發生、稍頃霧亦稍退、至三時許霧露又重、三時四十分、船到山東半島石島外、約十六碼海面、圖南早開、慢車緩行、依照航海定例、速率極小、並放霧笛、亦聞彼别輪笛聲、至三時五十分、在相距圖南船首、有兩字以外、圖南船主立發回聲、令長春丸側讓、顧日輪來如飛奔、圖南汽笛方拉、而日船紅燈已發見、長春丸船頭、已向圖南右舷第二艙、突然猛撞、但聞轟然一響、圖南已被日輪、從船主樓起、切成兩段、立時沉没、據姜孫二人言、歷來撞船未有如此之速快而一撞兩段者、其慘狀更有不堪陳述也、</p>
<h3>被難慘劇</h3>
<p>船上全部船員及旅客、共有二百人以上、撞碰時、多數旅客、已入夢鄉、水手及中艙部人員、亦皆安睡、當被撞成兩段之際、姜長慶從船樓上跌下、壓入船樓之下、大副孫作人與水手生火等、在艙面者共有二十人、圖南被撞斷後、自船頭至第二艙切爲一段、立向海内下沉、僅三分鐘、便即沉失、其船頭部沉下海内時、被海浪衝捲、片刻船底向天、圖南之後半身、自第三艙至後尾一段、霎時稍尾直立向天、此時長春丸輪、仍向前進、並未停車止開、惟在掉船之時、日輪與圖南成一線並行勢、船主姜長慶與大二副等、均不顧死活、奮向日輪躍去、姜則兩手扳住長春丸之船洞、大二副及生火水手等十九名、則跳上長春丸、跌在甲板上者有之、扳住巴門邊者有之、故無一人不受傷、又有在上層台甲之搭客八人、亦在相撞後、冒險躍入日輪内、各人在長春丸回視圖南、已經沉没、蓋距撞碰、不過四五分鐘也、</p>
<h3>監視救援</h3>
<p>其不及逃出艙面、及在臥室内各船員旅客、眼見其隨輪下沉、長春丸此時並未停車、但姜長慶等要求、請其放舢舨、救撈被難員客、日人始令長春丸停航、放舢舨多艘、由姜等監視下、駛往助救、其時滿海均抛滿船内散簍之水菓·破桶之油與鹽魚·迨舢舨至石島海面、圖南已無形踪、有多數船員乘客、在海面扳住木板·及其他物件·而飄流於海浪中者、乃得陸續撈上舢舨、送入長春丸船上、在海面撈起之人、個個赤體無衣、蓋在臥室内落水者、又個個受傷、係在海内被濤浪挾捲之木板零物等擊傷也、内有理貨部一人因受傷過重、救起後即死、刻已在大連收殮矣、</p>
<h3>死亡人數</h3>
<p>記者復詢姜船主究竟喪亡員客若干、據姜君言、船員内救出五十四名、死者二車一人、生火四人、水手九人、管事六人、中艙部共死三十二名、旅客方面、據買辦部分報告、購票搭客之可以查考者、計一百零一人、而救起者共三十六人、則溺死者爲六十五名、其他未購船票、而爲茶房等私帶黃魚之客、（即不買票之乘客、爲茶房生意之一種、曰帶黃魚）、共有若干、今茶房多數死亡、更無從查知矣、按報告死亡總數、則爲一百十七人也、而由長春丸救到大連者、共計船員五十四人、旅客三十六人、合計爲九十人云</p>
<h3>拒絕簽字</h3>
<p>長春丸載此被難救起員客九十人往大連時、該船主在途中、忽代姜長慶擬就兩船相撞之報告書、計一分爲長春丸報告、一分爲圖南輪報告、其報告書用日文寫、擬就後、長春丸船主乃令姜長慶簽名、蓋預備送交大連海關、及海事法庭、與大連汽社者、姜船主以此事關係重大、豈可由日人片面代擬報告、當即拒絕簽字、謂本人不識日本文字、對於報告中作何語、均所不知、未便貿然簽字、日人一再要求、姜乃絕對不允、結果未簽、及十一日上午十時、到大連後、即由招商大連分局、代覓一小客棧、命此九十人居住、各人在被救脱險時、均衣履不全、旅客水手、至有赤體者、姜乃向分局磋商借欵、至十二日始凑得六百元、遂由姜氏分發每高級船員三十元、水手生火各給五元、旅客各給三元、爲購買衣履之資、同時又電滬局請匯三千元到連、以便購票回滬、</p>
<h3>旅客四散</h3>
<p>救起旅客三十六名、到大連後、有多數不欲到上海、即在大連給資遣散、當有二十一人、自大連赴牛莊、又有一人赴烟台、另有三人、則留居大連、不再來滬、姜船主因十二日晚、滬局電匯二千元欵項已到、即行發艙、每名川資三元另用三元、送各人上輪而去、至於隨同來滬之十一人旅費、統由局方購買、姜長慶在大連與日輪社磋商、詎大連汽社不允免費送滬、結果、以一千四十元、購得船票六十五張、乘來上海、此十一客中、有女客兩名、昨晨抵滬後、經局方各給每人川資兩元、令其自行歸家、姜船主在大連下輪時、又補給生火水手等各船員每人費用十六元、</p>
<h3>二車被難</h3>
<p>又據被難救起某船員言、二車鄭金生、本可逃生、渠仗自身熟諳游泳、乃於圖南撞成兩截後、渠因臥室内有現欵衣服等尙未取出、故重又入船、初不料一入船内、竟無法再出、蓋沉輪時、水有吸力、總能游泳、亦難脱逃、遂致斷送生命、言之可痛、</p>
<h3>旅客姓名</h3>
<p>圖南此次由大連駛滬、載貨載客、較往次特别多、貨物有鹽七八百包、鹹魚七八百件、水菒二千餘件、交通銀行現洋二十萬元、以及其他荳餅、糧食、雜貨甚多、今連船下沉、人客方面、船員約一百零四五名、獲救五十三名、搭客二百十餘名、遇救三十六人、除營口登岸十五名小工、其他有受傷尙在大連醫院者外昨日到滬搭客祇十一名茲查得姓名（一）張素林、（二）劉產根、（三）陸湘林、（四）葉恩元、（五）戴松廷、（六）秦鼎臣、（七）郭元表、（八）鍾惠彰、（九）夏四、（十）林氏女性、（十）（一）邱氏、女性、總計死難在二百三十名以上、</p>

<h3>新變消息兩歧</h3>
<p>王子耀之函電趙福成之談話新聲社云、新疆第二次事變、馬仲英敗挫後、現又向迪化反攻、因之迪化與蘭州間交通、有再被阻斷説、然歐亞航空公司則否認之、昨日、李杜將軍代表王子耀氏、已來函電報告、茲分誌之於次、</p>
<h3>馬仲英反攻</h3>
<p>頃據西北最近來人談、新省事變、自馬仲英被盛世才部擊潰後、即退至哈密以來、然其實力、尤得保存、未有極大損失、外傳馬氏陣亡、與本人受傷、以及部下崩潰等等、均係謠傳、雖曾敗挫、近與纏回聯絡、聲勢又見浩大、藉哈密一帶爲根據、正向迪化反攻中、盛世才則仍依蘇李由俄退新舊部抗戰中、因之迪化與哈密間形勢頗形嚴重、</p>
<h3>王子耀被阻</h3>
<p>頃據李杜將軍接秘書王子耀自蘭州來電報告云、植公鈞鑒、迪哈愈形惡化、機不能前往、黃（慕松）隨員王應榆夏仲毅返京、煩帶詳函、一號機到、可詢知眞像、</p>
<h3>函李杜報告</h3>
<p>李杜將軍、昨於收到其秘書王子耀電告之後、中午於歐亞第一號飛機到滬時、續又收到一函、報告新省情形等甚詳、該函雖不允發表、然據探悉、其中大致係報告新省亂事、尙未平定、新疆天山南路回纏、仍在騷動中、馬仲英現從中鼓動、抵蘭州後、因氣候不佳、故飛機不能前進、函中對迪化與哈密之情形未提及、蓋以蘭州距迪哈行程尙遠、内中詳情、一時尙無從確知故也、</p>
<h3>交通仍照舊</h3>
<p>昨午新聲社聞西北交通被阻之消息後即以電話向歐亞航空公司經理李景樅氏詢問、據云、李氏對此表示非事實、謂新省亂事、雖云嚴重、然亦並不如此之甚、至上次王子耀乘飛機往迪化、行至蘭州·即行中止説、則確係事實、其原因謂因新省亂事嚴重之關係、固亦有之、然在另一方面、則確係因航空氣候等關係、故上星期出發之飛機、行抵蘭州後、即行中止、然此爲公司方面欲絕對避免發生有關政治之誤會、不得已而出此舉、蓋本公司爲營業性質之機關、對各方面旣有相當信譽、則公司方面、更不能不對此種信譽、再求深造、此亦不得已之苦衷也、然下星期二（即明日）出　之歐亞飛機、俟其抵蘭州時、無論如何、必送王子耀等赴迪化云、</p>
<h3>黃返京有待</h3>
<p>新疆宣慰使黃慕松之隨員王應榆夏仲毅等、業乘歐亞第一號飛機抵京、向中央報告、聞黃在新、確被監視、然頗優待、蓋因黃與盛世才以前係同學、在京時復同事約二年餘、故黃之安危、絕無問題、大約俟新省主席與督辦人選確定後、即可回京、云</p>
<h3>趙福成談話</h3>
<p>國聞社云、甘肅三十三師師長馬仲英代表趙福成、日前由新疆乘飛機赴京、分謁中央各中委、並轉江西、晋謁蔣委員長、報告新疆事變經過、昨日趙氏由贛來滬、記者特晤之於旅邸、承發表談話如次、新疆地處邊陲、交通梗塞消息遲滯自金樹仁出走後、各方對於敝師入新經過、多未詳悉、每有根據片面傳聞、加以貶抑、其實此次事變經過、中央實至明瞭、勿待本人再爲詞費、至敝師長率部入新、實因新疆内部發生倒金運動、新邊民衆、因歷年飽受金氏之荼毒、無可伸説、而倒金消息、軍民分派代表環請敝師長率部入新、爲民衆解除痛苦、敝師以大義所在、慨允出師、原欲弭患無形、免致範圍擴大、是以軍行所至、各界倍表歡迎、先後情形、並經疊電報告蔣委員長在案、不知者、以爲敝部妄自出師、企圖地盤、而造謠誣陷、更復虚搆事實、多方離間、甚則加以共產之名、又謂敝部利用漢回界限、煽動回民用心實至陰毒、回憤民國二十年前、敝部駐紥哈密、金樹仁聯合赤俄、無端攻擊、今竟有人以共產加諸敝師、實不値一哂、至敝師軍官軍佐、多屬漢人、若謂畫分漢回畛域、煽動回人、是無異自破藩籬、雖屬至愚、亦不出此、總之、事實眞相、不久自明、敝師惟有恪遵中央命令、靜候政府派員處理、免再引起事端、本人此次代表敝師赴贛謁蔣、蔣委員長對於敝師情形、極爲明察、並囑帶敝師長一函原文如下、子才師長勛鑒、趙代表來、携到手摺、並晤談一切、獲悉公忠體國、融洽漢回、大義皎然、至深嘉慰、共黨滅絕人紀、覆亡國家、稍有智識、皆知其害、以兄明達有爲、自必不肯盲從附和與通聲氣至若漢回則更一家骨肉親愛有素、中央方面、倚兄爲干城、尤無妄加挑撥、貽禍邊陲、致强鄰生心、召寇自焚之理、故經迭有以二事　告、中皆一笑置之、從不置信、（中略）兄在西北將領中、最爲少年英挺、中始終愛護殷切、希善自鍜鍊、定克養成偉器、前程實至遠大、故中一再致電諄諄相喩、意實在此、（下略）蔣中正、七月四日、</p>

<h3>電力工潮調停無結果</h3>
<p>公司拒受四項條件上海電力公司工人、爲要求發給工頭楊阿巧·退職金問題、引起糾紛、而公司當局復開除工會理事倪文富等四人、致工潮益趨嚴重、華董袁履登氏徇工方之請、於前日向公司當局進行調停、但無結果、尙擬繼續磋商解决、茲分紀各情如下、</p>
<h3>調停經過</h3>
<p>自該項工潮轉趨嚴重後、市總工會爲防止擴大計、當推派執委邵虚白、陪同工會代表往謁華董袁履登、請出任調停、袁氏亦爲顧全雙方利益及社會公用事業計、卽於前日、（十五）上午十時、驅車赴江西路總公司進行調停、當以副裁海而特因病請假、由霍潑根斯代表接見、袁氏首宣述來意、並希望公司顧念工人生活、予以相當諒解、免致激起重大糾紛、霍氏對袁氏善意調停、表示非常感激、但認爲被開除者、確係有意搗亂煽動怠工、故實未能再予復職、至於退職金問題、公司規定、因在裁减員工而退職者、則給予退職金、倘因犯過或自動辭退者、公司未便發給、關於撫恤金問題、公司所定辦法、已極優容、當無問題、袁霍商達一小時許但終以公司態度堅决、致未獲圓滿結果、</p>
<h3>工方憤激</h3>
<p>自工潮發生後、四區水電工會卽召集新老兩廠全體頭目、舉行聯席會議、經决定向公司提出四項條件、除一面商請袁履登出任調停外、一面卽將該項條件原文、並正式致函向公司提出、詎公司方面、飭知收發處、拒絕收受該項函件、而袁氏前往善意調停、又拒不接受、以是工方羣情憤激、昨特召開會議、决定推派代表、定今日面詣總理、提出交涉云、</p>
<h3>總委表示</h3>
<p>據總工會執委邵虚白君表示、電力公司係公用機關、一旦工潮爆發、勢必影響整個社會、關係至爲重大、故經商請華董袁履登出任調停、以期廠方諒解、消弭糾紛、但廠方竟堅持原議、未允讓步、實深遺憾、惟據袁履登氏語余、該案廠方態度雖堅决、但尙未完全决裂、如果工方、能將所提條件、再酌量修改、或尙有調解餘地、故余已轉知工方磋商、俟修正條件後、將再請由袁氏續行調停、務使該案得早日解决也、但如果廠方仍無誠意、則因此而引起糾紛、應由公司負其全責云云、</p>

<h3>春秋網子</h3>
<p>「東洋魚」是在小菜塲　，很有地位的。因爲「東洋魚」產量之可驚，我於是乎恍然大悟到日本漁夫捕魚術之精妙，而更聯想到捕魚用之「網」的厲害。</p>
<p>我記得日本有二條「生命線」。一條是「陸上生命線」，以東北。一條是「海上生命線」，是德屬南洋羣島。「陸上生命線」，以大連爲中心，没命的向豎　拉，橫　放，竟結成了一個網羅，我整個東北的「大網」，而「漁翁得利」了。這一個特别豐收的「魚汎」，果然是漁夫之有「天官賜」，但是「飲水思源」，總不能「吃魚忘網」。　　「海上生命線」是漁夫在南海捕魚所需的「網」的軸線，年來飛機，軍艦的擴充，就爲了要完成這一個「大網」。這一個「大網」，若不給大　魚衝一個窟窿，那麽這一個大網所獲之「東洋魚」，勢必將擠倒歐美的市塲。</p>
<p>照這幾天的情形着來，日本的漁夫們，似乎在海參崴，庫頁島之間，又在進行築「網」工作了。他們在東北用的「魚餌」，是「中村大尉」，如今換湯不換藥的用「三漁夫」做「魚餌」，而想再來一次「滿載而歸」。但是「薩門魚」是比較强悍，是否能像「中國魚」那麽容易捕捉，可就難説啦。</p>
<p>聴説日本漁父現在還想把大連的中心點，移到靑島，重起爐灶，再來一「網」把白河，黃河以至於西北高原裡，所有的黃魚，網魚，以及泥　，土鱔，一律製成「東洋魚」。日本漁夫的「捕魚術」，久仰高明，一旦「大網」結就，何愁不「　網大吉」；「網到成功」。</p>
<p>日本漁夫橫一「網」，臨豎一「網」的「網」之不已，我們這些雖不上他的鈎兒，而暫爲「漏網之魚」，但待到「竭澤而漁」，四萬萬同胞，「魚貫入網」，準備給漁夫們捕捉入釜，或陳列於鮑魚之肆的時候，是否還有閒情逸致，頌　大腿與香賓，那倒是一個疑問。</p>
<h3>鍾憲鬯之採集植物趣聞阿絜</h3>
<p>要救中國，第一須從科學上着想。所謂「科學」也者，當然範圍很廣，紙上的科學，和販賣式的科學，其實都是不中用的。所以在下對於現下學校所敎授的科學，老大不敢贊成。因此，我便想起鎭海鍾憲鬯先生來了。</p>
<p>鍾先生本來是位文學家，在前淸光緒年間，他老人家旣不去研究法政，又不去研究醫學，做官，做議員，當然没有這個思想。他老人家竟喜歡研究動植物和理化起來，眞可説開了全國風氣之先。這時候，研究自然科學的，不過杜亞泉，杜就田，張修爵，謝洪賚，吳稚暉，馬君武幾位先生。他在上海創辦了理科專修學校，據説蔡孑民先生，還來入學肄業咧。</p>
<p>到了現在，他老人家應該可以做官了，娛娛暮景，享享淸福，我們也不能説一句老前輩的不是。可是他老人家，却有些古怪脾氣，孜孜兀兀，依舊來研究一草一蟲，跑東奔西，栖栖皇皇，好像極有興味，國裏的人，也不知道我們貴國裏有這一位「皓首窮物」的老先生</p>
<p>這幾年，先生爲了採集全國的植物起見，北走胡，南走越，楚閩桂滇，蹤跡殆遍，採集琪花瑤草，做了標本，委實可觀。有一年，先生深入閩省的某山中，伐茆斫棘，登崖涉溪，他老人家不是時不説了，知府間他何故，他説：「恐怕大人見怪。」知府説：「但説無妨」。</p>
<p>他説道：「第三是大人的面孔」</p>
<p>大人的面孔，放在第三，當然是比女私，和屁股還要難看了。不過相騐時，女屍的私處，照例要用濕紙蓋上，就是看一下，也不過一刻工夫；犯人的屁股，如果打得利害時，知縣也可掉轉頭不看，甚而至於學唱戲一樣，提起大袖子，當起自己的面孔，也就完了。其實，還是看的好，還是多看的好。你睢，現在不是都愛曲線美嗎。這兩樣東西，女私和屁股是線的最曲處，美的集中點，知縣老爺，遇到相騐打板子時，大可特加鑒賞，比着看油畫的模特兒，應有實地考察，與隔靴搔癢之分了。這實在不能算難看。</p>
<p>惟有大人的面孔，扳起來，鐵靑像死人，猙獰像惡鬼，望而生畏，濕紙當不住，頭也掉不轉，袖子更不敢提，越是難看，越要你看，眞是説不出的苦！</p>
<p>現在大人的尊稱，是消滅了，而大人的面孔，依然擺着，也不一定到衙門裏纔看得到。到租界上，巡捕會擺出大人的面孔到商舖裏，夥計會擺出大人的面孔；還有説不盡了。最奇怪的，你的嬌妻，有時也會擺出大人的面孔。</p>
<h3>不勝今昔之感憶秋</h3>
<p>昔他對他的妻子説：「我要出去一件藍顏色的長衫拿出來」伊很馴服，不聲不響走到後房衣櫉裏拿了出來，把長衫張開，侍候他兩臂伸進了袖管，在他自己上面的鈕扣還没有捉好時，伊早已屈了腰替他將下擺上的鈕子扣好了他自己戴上帽子就走，在剛走出房門時，又回頭吩咐伊：「今朝中飯早點燒好！」説着就出去了。</p>
<p>今伊對伊的丈夫説：「我要出去看蜜斯李！那件單大衣拿出來！」他很忠勇，必恭必勤地搬箱子，從底下一隻大箱子裏找了出來，把大衣張開，侍候伊兩臂伸進了袖管，在伊自己的鈕子還没有扣好時，他早已俯下頭去，將伊脚上的漆皮鞋擦亮了伊自己取了手皮夾就走，在剛走出房門時，又回頭吩咐他：「晚上二點鐘到逸園跳舞塲來接我！」説着就出去了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>第十一回俯首許婚烟芳情脈脈關心到士卒喜氣洋洋有一次，我送兩碗吃的東西到他家去，和他的手碰了一下子，事後總覺得軟綿綿的，暖温温的，説不出來有那麽一種好處。我要娶了他做媳婦，新婚那天晚上，第一下子，我就得握住了他的手，把以前，我心裏這一分痛快，詳詳細細的告訴他。我想他，一定是低了頭，抿了嘴，只管微笑。那一個姿色，在一對大紅蠟燭下看着，那是多麽有味。他心裏想着得意，手也就不覺得向床上一拍，他自己無原無故的拍上一下子，倒也無所謂。把一個剛進門的上士王十立倒嚇了一跳，向後連退了兩步，以爲連長是向他發什麽氣呢。趙自强看到門口一個人影子一閃，不知何人來了，也就跳了起來。看到上士在那兒站着啦，便笑道：我剛才一高興，拍了一下床，你嚇着了吧！没關係，將來你可以多喝我幾杯喜酒就是了。你娶媳婦的時候，辦的是什麽酒席？這幾句話，眞有些莫明其妙。爲什麽連長好兒的向自己説起娶媳婦的事來了。可是連長問了，又决不能一句話都不答覆，便笑道：我還没有家眷呢。趙自强搖着：别躭誤了，有機會就説一個罷。我知道你一定是説現在手邊没有錢。其實遇到彼此情投意合的，那也用不着花什麽錢。再説，你現在先定好了，將來有機會再娶過門，那也要不了多少錢？王士立一想，趙連長那裏來這種經騐，突然的告訴我聽。而且，誰也没有惦記到娶親的這件事上來，他爲什麽把這話來告訴我？可是心裏儘管疑惑着表面上却不好有什麽表示，就向他笑道：趙連長説的是，我託重你，將來看到相當的，和我説上一個。（一三二）</p>
<p>哥侖布，要探險新地，也没有柳子厚吟詩作紀的逸致，他的唯一目的，在發見新的植物。</p>
<p>果然天從人願，他老人家搜着了一種新奇的植物，不覺喜極欲狂，哈哈大笑</p>
<p>道：「好寳貝！好寳貝！」笑聲還没有完，森林裏忽然跳出兩個强徒來，把槍口對着先生道：「呔！快把寳貝拿出來，當心你的腦袋吧！」先生微笑道：「你要寳貝嗎？敬以奉贈。」一壁説，一壁打開了採集箱，拿出來似柴一把的植物，送到强徒手裏去。强徒倒怔了一怔，惡狠狠地迫着先生拿出寳物來。先生又笑了笑道：「這些東西，在我瞧來，比黃金還要寳貴；所以説它是件寳貝，不過你們不當寳貝看啦。」强徒把先生遍身，檢搜了一回，畢竟找不出寳貝，便一聲呼嘯而去。</p>
<h3>大人的面孔君惕</h3>
<p>從前有個笑話：一個知縣，向知府表示辭職，知府問他什麽原故？他説：「有三樣難看的東西，實在受不了，所以不幹。這三樣難看的東西：第一是相騐時女屍的私處：第二是打板子時犯人的屁股：第三」當他説至此（鄙人並未看見特此鄭重聲明）</p>
<p>我就不橫，何以好好的一副面孔，要把它變得比女私和屁股還難看？更不　爲什麽把這種比女私和屁股還難看的東西，擺出給别人看？</p>
<h3>小朋友的小玩藝持佛</h3>
<p>小朋友啊！你們在學校裏，有種種的游戲，甚麽打乒乓，踢鍵子，跳蠅，賽球，捉迷藏，以及功課裏的竹工木工雕刻　土繪畫唱歌，都是感着多少興趣。在放假的時候，約了幾個小弟弟小妹妹，放風箏，辦野宴，也覺得很有興味的。書本裏不是説過嗎？晉朝有位陶侃，做了大官，把竹頭木屑，都搬到家裏來，説這些都是有用之物，不肯廢棄。後來造船，便用竹頭來作釘；天下大雪，便把木屑來舖地，説天下没有廢物，要在我們能夠利用而已。諸位小朋友相信這件故事，也應該曉得廢物可以利用的了現在我來略舉幾種，供給小朋友做小玩藝，不曉得還有更好别的小玩藝嗎（一）瓜子鷄將瓜子數枚，嗑開尖頭，互相銜接，造成鷄的軀體。前面用一枚瓜子接筍，當做了鷄頸；頸前嵌一枚瓜子肉作鷄頭。尾用瓜子兩枚銜接，微微豎起。再用瓜子兩枚，左右生在體上，做了翅膀。　　玉手，作這個小玩藝兒，豈不是很有趣味的嗎？</p>
<p>（二）魚鶴把帶魚的頭骨，洗滌淸楚，鑲起來可做成一頭仙鶴。頭蓋骨便當做了仙鶴軀幹；腮外兩片的蝴蝶形骨骼，可以鑲攏來做成翅膀；還有幾根直骨，兩根做脚，一根做頭，頸端用紅絨線紮成鶴首，再揀一根尖鋭的小骨，來做鶴嘴，那末，全鶴成功了。用線懇之，栩栩欲活，十分美觀。諸位小朋友，你們吃了魚肉以後，不妨試一試啊！</p>
<p>（三）橘籃橘爲味美的佳果，富於果酸，吃了，可助消化·平肝·解渴·生濜！所以小朋友在飯後不妨來吃一二隻，委實有益無損。小朋友還可以把橘做爲花籃；在橘皮上用小刀劃分，徐徐翻轉橘皮，便是姣小玲瓏的花籃了。</p>
<p>（四）高梁蚱蜢　用一寸左右高梁桿兩條，把線紮牢；線的一端，中綴短桿，桿之一端，可以粘着高梁桿中央貼膏的部分。放在桌上，便會跳躍，很像田　蚱蜢一般，十分活潑。小朋友要使蚱蜢跳躍的時候，便可把中綴短桿，粘在貼膏部分，又會跳躍起來了。</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第五章醫藥之行政</p>
<p>第三節近年來之政令</p>
<p>（附註）本文上期表格，因排版怱促，製版不及，項目參差不明，誤會之弊，容或不免，一時無從更正，胥以他日單行本爲準。</p>
<p>醫藥的政令，在理是全國的事，不是上海一隅的事。然而鄙人在本文的弁言内，早已聲明上海爲醫藥中心，而複雜支離的情形，反以上海爲甚，所以專談上海所受的政令，以槪其餘。查上海市内第一次有取締醫藥的政令，是在民國十五年商埠督辦時代，那年的十一月，由商埠警廳劉嗣榮，同衛生局長胡鴻基，會同了登記過一次醫生，似乎先從新醫入手，而取法於北京政府的成案。因爲當時北京内務部衛生司領了部照，僅僅證明有醫師資格，而要在北京開業，還須經過警察廳的允許，所以淞滬商埠即警衛二局局長會銜給照，但是進行没多時候，政局忽又變動，衛局又曾中斷。到了十六年六月，已是國民軍時代了，記得胡鴻基氏再來長市衛生局，又辦登記，換了全新色彩，雖不能舉行一種考試却要審查文憑，足見那時候當局目光漸漸注意到龐雜的實况了。有一個「醫師開業試騐委員會」，是衛生局函聘市内各醫學校的敎授組織的，每校派二三人，一二人不等，記得那時有樂文照·高鏡朗·湯蠡舟·陳卓人·宋國賓·夏愼初·王景陽·尤彭熙一干人是委員，名爲試騐，其實只是依照衛生局所定四年以上學校畢業的標準，審查文憑而已。但是其中有二點狠難解决·第一所謂學校，皆自稱四年，無法證明；第二一切醫院皆稱附有醫校也，無從駁斥，衛局將難題交與委員，委員們没有周密的方法，以致於鬧出了許多笑話，而半途中止了。有一位西醫，是李平書託張竹君辦理上海醫院時代，一種練習生的門人，可以呌做上海醫院再傳弟子，他却千方百計早弄了一張文憑，而又恐文憑没有價値，於是異想天開，將這張文憑請上海醫院的鼻祖李平書先生鑑定，李平老也妙得狠，援筆在他文憑邊上寫道：「某月某日李鍾珏敬觀。」此老簡直拿出平泉書屋頑字畫的手筆來對付他，也可算滑稽之至了。此外因爲非學校而被審查否决的人，簡直就天天奔走於各委員之門，或請開苞苴之門，或竟發恐嚇之論；結果各委員受不住這種謾駡恫嚇，也就不再繼續工作，好在南京正在那裏組衛生部，我們小百姓希望中央奠定，百政俱舉，自有公平的法度，又何必多此紛爭呢。至於舊醫一方面，那年也辦登記，那時衛生局長自己是新醫，把權柄交與中醫的名宿去辦，後來索性弄到年年登科，個個及第，局長還受新醫界許多指摘哩。我們貴國，自辛亥革命，人民首先誤解平等，到國民政府成立，又來一陣誤解自由，不論那一界人民，就來一個「不知名分」，「不問是非」，硬要爭地位，硬要不勞而獲，以至凡百政令，都有人阻梗着，又豈獨醫藥界爲然呢。</p>
<h3>寸口診脈的討論（五）</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>（十一）寸口三部的脈絕對没有獨遲獨速的可能</p>
<p>寸口三部的脈，只是一條，只是千百條動脈分枝裏面的一條。他的跳動，只是心臟跳動的影響，上文已經説得明明白白，受過中等敎育以上的人們，也應該曉得明明白白，從此可以知道不動則已，若是動起來，當然是三部一齊俱動，决不會有寸動關不動，關動尺不動的事。也就是决不會有寸一動，關兩動，關一動，尺兩動的事。論理，獨大獨小，獨沈獨浮，也不應該有的。因爲心一跳動，只有一種壓力出來，影響到血行上去的緣故，但是脈管自己的構造，處處不同，有粗的地方，有細的地方，所以獨大獨小，是有可能的理由。脈管地位，也處處不同，有淺在皮下的，有深入肌肉的，所以獨沈獨浮，也是有可能的理由。雖然如此，只不過脈管構造位置的不同關係，並不是什麽藏氣現象的通信報告。至於説起遲速來，就是遲則俱遲，速則俱速，决不會有寸脈獨遲，尺脈獨速的事。如果説是有獨遲獨速，就是造謊，就是騙人，就是欺詐行爲。但是國醫所奉爲太上律令的素問書裏三部九候篇，就説道：「獨疾者病，獨遲者病」。許學士本事方傷寒案説道：「尺以下遲而弱」，吕元膺診張恩軒案説道：「關及尺數而且芤」，薛立齋診顧斐齋案説道：「肝脾腎脈，洪大而數」，這都是造謊騙人，欺詐行爲的證據。現在國醫們的脈案裏面，也常有這種字樣，可以找得出來，請國人從實調查一下，審察一下，向開有這種獨遲獨速的方案國醫們，質問一下。</p>
<p>（十二）脈有時可憑有時不可憑的理由何在</p>
<p>總而言之，脈是血管的跳動，是心臟跳動的影響，所以把把脈，却可以知道心力强弱，可以知道心動規則不規則：可以知道心動有歇心没有：可以知道脈管有無硬化：可以知道血壓高低；這幾件事，是把脈的法兒可以測騐得出來的。所以國醫裏面，除却盲目冥心，醉生夢死，到死主張「分部候藏，確有可憑」，的一般笨貨以外，却有許多人説：「脈法是有時可憑，有時不可憑」，的灰色態度論調，出這種論調的人，大約是診着心臟和血管毛病的人們，覺得内外相應，確有可以偵探病的價値。可是診着别種毛病的人們，却是病證和脈象，完全不相應，所以説有時可憑，有時不可憑，但是他們苦於没有分析的智能，不曉得可憑的是心臟和血管的毛病，不可憑的是分部候藏的瞎話，誤以爲全部脈象，都是有時可憑，有時不可憑，所以不敢奈何他。只得把「憑證不憑脈，憑脈不憑證」，的古人敎訓，來隨時留心就罷了。唉！分部候藏的荒謬，不是我一個人的私説，也不是我一個人的創説，古人也　　説過的，我且引幾個人的話，來給　人看看：李瀕湖説道：「余每見時醫，於兩手六部之中，按之又按，曰某藏府如此，某藏府如彼，儼若藏府居於兩手之間，可捫而得，種種欺人之醜態，實則自欺之甚也」。徐靈胎説道：「病之名有萬，而脈之象不過數十種，且一病而數十種之脈無不可見，何能診脈而即知其爲何病，此皆推測偶中，以此欺人也」。陳修園説道：「時醫開口輙云脈象，（脈象兩字，做國醫條例諸君，請提起耳來聽着）。便知其怕慣欺人小技，而學術必陋，凡醫書論脈愈詳，讀者愈難體會，大抵不肯説實話耳」。這三個人，總要算是近代的大醫生，而且研究學問的人，他們在那時候，已經講得這樣痛快，若是生在現代，曉得科學的眞理，玄學的虚僞，一定是直言不諱，更要講得十二分透澈哩。</p>
<p>（十三）結論</p>
<p>依照上文所説，舊醫的脈學，完全是靠不住，完全是造謠；完全是説謊；完全是欺詐行爲；受過中等敎育以上的國人，應該透底明白了。國醫館中主張用科學方式的比較頭腦淸明的諸位，也應該透底明白了，知過必改，是做人的要着，也是講學的要法，怙過不悛，是永遠不會進步的。國人如有眞正認識，非把這個有二千年歷史的欺詐行爲打倒不可。國醫諸君如有眞正覺悟，非把這個有二千年歷史的欺詐行爲取消不可。國醫館如有眞正採用科學方式的誠意，非把這個有二千年歷史的欺詐行爲，通告全國國醫們，一律禁止不可。這方才是實事求是的中華國民。要是模模糊糊過去，對不起，不但國醫，就是日蹙國土百里的我們貴中國，也是一定要滅亡的。（完）</p>

<p>（四）癆症最後我要提到尋常人談虎色變的的癆病了。這種病患者比任何病症都多，不治者佔人類全體死亡率七分之一，在工業區域或人口繁盛之都市尙不止此數。此中患者最多的，那當然是肺癆（肺結核）一病了！他差不多占一切結核症百分之九十以上，但結核菌是任何身體部分幾乎都被侵襲的，另外的像喉結核腸結核患者也不少，並且和肺結核是有點因果的；急性傳染病中的全身粟粒結核，則係由結核菌竄入循環器内所致。這都是内科中的重要病症。在外科一方面，則有皮膚結核，皮下組織結核，肌肉結核，粘膜結核，淋巴管腺結核，骨結核，關節結核，腱和粘液囊結核種種；此中像狼瘡腺病胯關節炎龜骨等諸症，都非常重要的。對於内臟方面，肋膜腹膜侵襲的機會最多；另外像腎臟泌尿器乳腺甲狀腺脾臟肝臟，明顯的例也是狠多的。假使每一種者想明白大槪，那决對不是本文篇幅所可盡的。所以關於結核症的分類，有許多地方是狠困難的。病理解剖上和臨床上固然不同，照他的性質或侵襲的部分而分類也都可以的。就單拿肺結核來説罷，已有乾酪性肺炎乾酪性氣管枝肺炎奔馬性肺癆等數種分别，從病灶蔓延之情形，又分一二三三期；另外又有閉鎖性或開放性肺結核的分别。那全體結核症當然是更加複雜，而非本篇所可盡的了！</p>
<p>關於結核症傳染途徑，大半係與空氣同時吸入的，所謂小滴傳染是；這種情形，差不多大家都知道了。因食物而傳染的也狠多，最明顯的例是牛乳，小兒飲之而直接發生腸結核者殊多。此外像皮膚損傷，口吻接觸，和由房事而外陰部傳染此症者，爲例也不少。但結核菌由胎盤而傳染胎兒一問題，到現在還是一個疑問。凡面狹長，頸長，胸狹，</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>鎖骨上窩陷凹甚深者，最易患結核，所謂癆瘵質是也。此外則先天性肺動脈狹窄鬱血肺等變態，俱可爲本症發生之誘因。</p>
<p>結核症的經過，除一部分少數外，大槪是慢性。關於他的主要症象，像欬血盜寒食慾不佳消耗熱等種種，曉得的人是狠多的，並且近來這一類的通俗文字也比較的最多，爲節省篇幅計，本文也不再重複了！</p>
<p>結核症的最新治療，我們當然不能説已經有專門特效辦法，但一部分確實是可以使病家滿意的。像人工氣胸術和Tｈｒｅｕｉｋｏｔｏｎｉｅ手術，對於一側肺結核是狠見卓效的；鐵勃古靈長期療治，以及矽酸鈣類等劑，對於局部全部症象，有時助力也是狠大的。對於症象種種之對症療法，比較從前也完善多了！我想總不至於和吃胎盤或其他無聊丹方的無意義罷？</p>
<p>結核症能全愈一問題，可分二方面回答。像肺結核的病灶能全愈和健肺一樣，是不可能的；但對於患者全部痛苦之解除，以及身體營養之恢復原來狀態，换句話説，即一般人所認爲全愈狀態，希望是狠大的。至於復發與否，只完全視病者如何攝生而標準的。此中像奔馬性肺結核乾酪性肺炎全身粟粒結核和外科中的龜背胯關節炎等數症，比較的希望狠少，這是少數的例外。（完）</p>
<h3>醫學敎育中之兩大要點</h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>夫醫學爲專門學術。學生一入校門。即開始研究。自是厥後。其畢生過程。殆莫不在研究之中。故非有堅决之意志。强健之體格。不克勝任。先以基本系課目言之。如解剖、生理、病理、細菌、藥理、生物、化學等科。每科除聽講及表演外。實騐工作。每至夜以繼日。且須紀錄其結果。以與敎本相核對。敎本不足。繼之以雜志。及其他種種參考書籍。往往前人成案。於無意中。一一推翻。要非旁搜博引。不足以辨明是非。各種試騐。往往窮日之力。不能得其梗槪。其辛苦有如此者。至於臨床工作。亦極繁重。各項課目。繁複異常。門診病房。皆爲實習之地。而病人一入醫院。即須錄其病史。再作體格檢查。乃至便血痰液。無不一一化騐。以求病源。臨床期滿。即爲見習醫員。各種診視工作。皆須與敎授講師。共同研究。甚至寢饋其間。不遑休息。急急無片刻之暇。可以逸豫。畢業而後。開業問世。出診時刻。每難預定。沐風櫛雨。無間寒暑。尤以產科醫師之工作爲最難規定。日中夜半。祁寒盛暑。一聞邀請。倒屣應接。其繁忙有如彼者。即使不欲開業。或充敎師。或專研究。其工作一未減少。往往一題不成。至廢寖食。此種况味。愚已及身而嘗之矣。昔德人愛立司（Ｅａｒｌｉｃｈ）研究梅毒特效藥劑。屢試屢不滿意。至數百次而猶然。精誠所積。金石爲開。最後驚人之發明。始告成功。其研究精神之堅决。足資吾人之矜式。即以吾國往時之醫藥學者而言。昔李時珍編纂本草綱目。起於有明嘉靖二十一年。成於萬歷六年。其間經過凡二十六年。成書五十二卷。洋洋巨著。至今可稽。總上各點。可知醫學學者。無論爲學者爲醫師。爲研究專家。乃至爲著作家。其爲辛苦劬勞之工作。則無人能否認之。而此辛苦劬勞之工作。非徒恃堅决之意志。所能濟事。必具有强健之體格。然後能澈始澈終。達其目的。然欲達此目的。學生自己。與學校當局。必須分負其責。爲學生者。固當於平居暇日。以奮發精神。鍜鍊體格。爲己任。而醫校當局。對於學生體格。又不可不愼之又愼。以愚辦學之經騐。有一部份學生。往往因體格關係。修習一二年。即須修養若干時。甚者必須退學。亦有畢業後。因體力不勝。而抛棄其業務者。誠若此。非特個人實蒙不利。影響所及。國家社會。皆受莫大之損失。查吾國最普遍而摧殘靑年最猛烈之病症。厥爲肺病。全國人民之死因。亦以肺癆爲獨多。據最近之統計。吾國患肺癆者。在各病中佔百分之二十五。較之歐美各國。約三倍有奇。以愚所知。醫校學生。因肺癆而抛棄學業者。數亦不少。爲矯正缺點起見。醫校當局。應於學生入先修科及本科時。對於體格先作精密的檢查。稍有缺點。即行勸令醫治。始能入學。入學以後。亦須每年加以檢騐。而此種檢騐工作。决非聘一醫藥顧問。所能辦理。必須組織完備之衛生處。專司其事。指導學生。衛生習慣。及鍜鍊體格之道。有病即爲診治。使之痊愈。尤其肺部。須加注意。最好攝愛克斯光片。以憑診斷。編成統計。以資考核。以上乃就體格而言。此外德性修養。亦關重要。因醫師操業。其性質原爲服務社會。非如市儈。爲利是圖。就字義而言。英文中Ｐｒｏｆｅｓｓｉｏｎ。「普魯翻新」一字。其涵義有二、Ｐｒｏ「普魯」者前也。Ｆｅｓｅｉｏｎ「翻新」者自承也。意謂在醫科讀書之時。應先自承爲社會服務。如政府職官之行宣誓禮然。非目論也。所謂Ｐｒｏｆｅｓｓｉｏｎ者。約分三種。一牧師。促進人格者也。二律師。保障人權者也。三醫師。維護生命者也。其涂雖殊。其爲服務社會則一。此外一切謀生謀利之職務。不得謂之「普魯翻新」Ｐｒｏｆｅｓｓｉｏｎ。醫師開業。旣爲服務。服務則自有報酬。生活問題。應可毋庸顧慮。欲求升官發財者。蹊徑甚多。請勿在醫界濫竽。故醫家所注意者。首爲病人。同業次之。自身又次之。處處懷犧牲之精神。在在抱服務之宏願。慈悲待人。勤奮自勉。斯爲允當。昔日Ｌａｚｅａｒ醫師。爲研究黃熱起見。不恤自己之身體。作試騐之工具。資蚊膏血。以求結果。卒因中毒而致死。研究未竟。一棺附體。其遇誠可哀。然其勇猛精進之猛牲精神。足以徂百代矣。自其反面言之。醫師苟以不道德行爲而漁利。其罪惡實浮於盜賊。因盜賊戕人。明目張膽。人皆知所趨避。而庸醫則以慈善之名義。行戕賊之實。末流所趨。包醫花柳。投藥墮胎。無所顧忌。殺人之烈。甚於市虎。言念及此。不寒而慄。且盜賊戕害。其目的僅在經濟。而庸醫刦財之外。並害其命。故愚曰庸醫之罪。浮於盜賊。非苛論也。然醫何自而庸。亦曰訓練之不足。學識之不充而已。查英文中庸醫二字。謂之「桂格」Ｑｕａｃｋ。由Ｑｕａｃｋｓａｌｖｃｒ一字之蜕化。其字義在英文即誇張之謂。在德文Ｑｕａｃｋ一字。爲人類仿效鷄鴨之鳴聲。而拉丁文中Ｓａｌｖｅｒ一字。有祝人健康之義。故庸醫者。鼓其如簧之舌。詐騙金錢。實爲僉壬不齒之徒。以語「普魯翻新。」不啻去題萬里。此術之所以不可不愼。學之所以不可不講。而醫學生之人格。不可不有以培養之也。</p>
<p>總上所言。學生體格之注意。與德性之講求。二者未能偏廢。由良好之學生。出而爲良好之醫師。然後「普魯翻新」一字。始能當之無愧。默化漸移。有待素養之二義者。言之多如老生常談。然七年之病。求三年之艾。苟爲不蓄。終身不得。負有醫學敎學之責者。其亦省循乎斯言。</p>
<h3>科學的達生篇（二十五）</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（二十一）母乳的營養</p>
<p>（甲）初乳的功用</p>
<p>產褥初二三日，由母體分泌一種透明稀薄，如水似膿，而有黃色斑點的汁液，這就是所謂初乳（或稱新乳幼乳）。初乳乳含有蛋白性乳糖等成分，比較普通乳來得量多，若在顯微鏡下檢視初乳，乃有大小不同的脂肪球，及似桑子形的初乳球，就是多數小脂肪滴的白血球。這種乳球，在三四日後，逐漸减少，就變爲晋通常乳，稱爲永久乳。初乳雖較永久乳來得稀薄，但所含有的鹽類化學成分較多，故有通痢浚下的作用，初生見吸之，能有排泄胎糞的功效。而世是乳兒起初最良的營養科，因爲可以少量的乳汁，數足營養之需，我國習俗，誤認初乳有毒，捨棄無遺，反而另投瀉下劑，以泄胎糞，往往因此誘發腸胃病，這是極大的錯誤。</p>
<p>（乙）自己哺乳的有益　　產褥開始以後，若能自己哺乳，非但有益於嬰兒的健康，即使在母體本身，亦可藉此增進食慾，添加營養，而且子宫收縮順利，惡露早凈，故而產褥經過，可得安全。所以兒有母乳營養的權利，母有親自哺乳的義務，雙方有益，莫此爲善。母乳對於親生兒的營養，含有下列各種優點：</p>
<p>㈠母乳中含有醱酵素，能助乳兒的消化。</p>
<p>㈡婴兒日長夜大，乳汁亦漸變更性質，而使發育，得有天然的適宜。</p>
<p>㈢母乳常有適宜的温度。</p>
<p>㈣毫無微生物的混入，毫無腐敗性的可慮。</p>
<p>㈤母乳中尙有一種抗毒素，功能預防的喉傷寒等傳染病。</p>
<p>（丙）分泌的注意</p>
<p>產後母乳分泌不多，甚至三五日以迄十日，尙未見有分泌下來，那時切勿武斷無乳，因爲乳的分泌，非吸不增，倘由兒口徐徐吮吸，那末非母體不健的原因外，乳汁自必增多。否則，若因起初分泌不足，代用别種乳汁，而不再吸，非但母乳永不增進分泌，並且有從此封鎖的不利。所以起初雖覺缺乏，仍當堅忍以待，並令嬰兒時常吸啜，自能源源而來，尋常所稱母乳不足，大都並非分泌排能的不完全，其實還是忍耐心的不充實吧。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>腸熱症（傷寒症）（續）</p>
<p>問神經系的病變怎樣？</p>
<p>答腸熱症，照西文原意，是出於希臘含有朦朧的意思。所以從前有稱爲神經熱的。那末神經系統的病狀，當然要發生的。在病的初期，有頭痛，失眠，容貎呈無慾狀，神識溷濁，或遲鈍狀。有陷於昏睡而發譫語的，也有精神憂鬱的，也有發揚狀的。有時，手掌和前臂的拳顯然飛躍。或用手指向中摸空捉影。此外見神精性重聽，大小便失禁，失語症，知覺過敏症，運動麻痺。間有發生和腦膜炎相似的病狀，像頭痛，嘔吐，項部强直，刻尼喜氏症候等。</p>
<p>問腸熱症病人循環器的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答脈搏比體温的度數，計算起來，比較的少。這是本病所特有的，通例不過九十到一百。至若脈搏數超過一百二十至以上，那是很危險的了。心臟心尖搏動盛，或第二大動脈音亢進。若兩者都减弱，那是心臟已經衰弱的徵兆。血管，靜脈生血塞，自發疼痛，壓痛和腫脹，有起動脈炎的。</p>
<p>問血液起什麽變化？</p>
<p>答赤血球和血色素减少，在初期有淋巴球增多，到第一星期的終末，來著明的血球減少症。</p>
<p>問腹熱症病人的皮膚怎樣？</p>
<p>答在第一二星期的交界，在胸和背部，發生薔薇疹，是特有的，這種發疹，像留針頭大小，是淡紅色充血性斑點，生出數個到數十個。因爲不久就褪色，所以有新舊隱約的斑點散佈各處。還有一種汗疹，呌做結晶性粟粒疹，俗稱白瘖，是在熱度弛張期，發汗過度的時候，生出來的。（發病第三星期）又有口唇匐行疹，但是很少。此外，在下肢有皮下出血，在手足有壞死；在薦骨部有褥瘡，毛髮脱落很利害。</p>
<p>問腸熱症病人的泌尿生殖器，也起變化嗎？</p>
<p>答在第一星期的時候，大多見熱性蛋白尿，有時起急性腎炎早期病人的尿中呈雙　反應（Ｄｉａｚｏ－Ｓｅａｃｔｉｏｎ）和華依司（Ｗｅｉｓｓ）氏反應。此外還有合併膀胱粘膜炎，腎盂炎睪丸炎，月經異常，早產，流產等。</p>
<p>問腸熱症病人是不是往往併發脚氣病？答是是。尤其是我們在平時常吃白米的人，因爲體内乙種維他命本來缺乏，到了害本病的時候，更顯出脚氣的病象了。（未完）</p>

<h3>「不存私心的嚴正的批評」</h3>
<p>— 葉聖陶</p>
<p>今天看見珠先生的「敎科書大傾銷」一文。他説敎科書「旣是有關於兒童敎育的特種「商品」，自然更應該比較比較，」又説「不存私心的嚴正的批評」實屬必要。在新近編成了一部小學國語課本的我，對於他的話抱着深切的同感。　　國語課本旣由書店出版，而且也追逐於「大傾銷」的浪潮之後，預備七折八扣地售出，其爲「商品」自無疑義。但是當製造這宗「商品」之初，我雖不欲戴起「爲文化服務」的大帽子，郤也自有一點「非商」業的徵意。我們的弟兄　　讀的是「天，地，日，月」的敎科書，我們的兒女輩讀的據稱是「兒童文學」，然而事實告訴我們，「天地日月」和「兒童文學」同樣不相干，兒童的閲讀能力與發表能力如果有進展的話，那完全由於别的因緣。别的因緣未可必遇，而課本郤是每天執在手裏的，爲什麽不編一部課本，以確能發展兒童的閲讀能力與發表能力爲目標呢？能不能達到這個目標是能力的問題，姑且盡力爲之郤是我的野心。這樣，我就提起筆來。</p>
<p>對於内容的分配，我作通盤的籌劃，不取那種「搭在籃裏就是菜」的支離辦法。對於文體的收納，我主張兼容博采，而且各篇須是各體的模式。對於課文的撰作，我希望念得上口，而且不背於名理。這樣地製造出來的「商品」是否適　「主顧」的需要，是否堪爲小學敎育的優良工具，我雖也曾當過近十年的小學敎師，郤未敢自己判斷。這有待於全國小學敎育者「不存私心的嚴正的批評」。　　在「不存私心的嚴正的批評」之下，假如我的書有一點兒可取，那末，即使在「大傾銷」的浪潮裏落了伍，從事營業競爭的出版家固然吃了虧，而編書的我郤有以自慰了：對於少數讀到我的書的兒童，我總算貢獻了一份禮物。反過來，如果我的書絕無足取，或者竟是有害於兒童的毒物，那末，即使在「大傾銷」的浪潮裏佔了先，從事營業競爭的出版家固然利市十倍，而我的粗製濫造之罪且將終身莫贖！</p>
<p>老實説，在以營業爲唯一前提的出版家是不希望有「不存私心的嚴正的批評」的。但是，爲敎育前途計，對於敎科書這宗特種「商品」必須有「不存私心的嚴正的批評」。同時，在抱有一點「非商業」的徵意的編書者如我，「大傾銷」的成敗似還非意所存，「不存私心的嚴正的批評」　是所切盼的。</p>
<h3>「整理」歟？抄襲歟？</h3>
<p>本刋日昨登有殘月君的「一部「剪影集」的世界文學史」，指明余慕陶所著「世界文學史」係自鄭振鐸著文學大綱，趙景深著中國文學小史等肅中「東剪西抄」而成，趙君讀後，當即寄來一稿，證明「人家用了他的著作的大半部」，而余君亦有一文答辯，承認是「整理」（這術語實在新頴！），而不承認是抄襲。茲將兩文一並發表於下，蓋本刋爲民衆喉舌，「態度　稱公正，言論素無偏倚」，是非曲直，當一任讀者公判也。編者</p>
<h3>答殘月談世界文學史</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>對於余慕陶先生的學　，我早就知道是不凡的。例如，他在「大衆文藝」上做過一篇文章，談到美國的新興文學，以爲只有辛克萊，賈克倫敦，哥爾德等四人。這夠多麽痛快！什麽新羣衆的一些作家，都不妨一筆鈎銷！</p>
<p>殘月説：「趙景深老哥假如看過這一本「像樣」的大作的話，總可心照吧。」似乎在説我「不宣」，其實我雖是濫好人，人家用了我的著作的大半部，總不能默默無言，所以也曾「宣」了一下：「余慕陶的「世界文學史」一字不易的拿剪刀來剪趙景深的「中國文學小史」以及别的書。」（見最近的微音月刋拙作「中國文學史書目解題」）</p>
<p>但是，話又説回來了，余先生究竟是可感謝的，他能下顧到我那本不「像樣」的小書，十年前的舊著，我實在感到萬分的榮幸。再過十年二十年，我的書一定會被淘汰，而余先生的大著竟流傳下去，使我的一點點文藝私見得附余先生的驥尾而傳世，那就尤其感到榮幸了！</p>
<p>感謝之餘，謹將二書雷同（不敢説是人家倫我的，將來人家也不妨説是我倫他的）之處，表列如下：</p>
<p>世界文學史上册中國文學小史曾國藩論古文叙言商一五面二○九</p>

<p>表寫完後，再附好評一個，替自己的著作吹嘘一下：「拙著與辛克萊專家唯物史觀的世界文學史「英雄所見略同」，足見本書之價値。」</p>
<h3>答殘月先生</h3>
<p>— 余慕陶</p>
<p>目前是個過渡時代。在這個過渡時代當中，我們的目標，不外是求得大衆向自由王國邁進而已。凡有利於這偉大使命的，我們都歡迎，否則，唯有用全力以拒絕之。</p>
<p>然而大衆之向自由王國邁進，并不是盲動地東奔西撞，倒是有計劃的理論指導。我個人自然是擁護了這指導理論，所以，我個人祗好拿我這一枝筆桿來稍盡棉薄。綜言之，我個人的寫作，特别是我曾再三申明我所「整理」的這部世界文學史，我是想把我所擁護的理論拿來普遍化，實踐化。</p>
<p>這部書畢竟是追紀歷史事實的東西，所以，我在這樣」個前題之下，對於材料的佈擺，誠不出殘月先生的標題所昭示，是「剪影　」。關於這個意思，我在本年三月十八日的「小貢獻」上，還有過自白。那題目是關於「世界文學史底話」。當時，我早就這樣説過：</p>
<p>「我的筆有時是剪刀，有時又是板斧，所以，我免不了是剪削了人家的東西。我始終承認本書是整理，更是側重於我所崇敬的方法的運用」</p>
<p>誠如是，我更大膽地承認我這本書的來源，不單是中國革命運動史等四本，還有「西方革命史」，「近代文化底基礎」，「日本社會史」，「日本文學史」，「歐洲文學發達史」，「近代歐洲文藝思潮」等二十餘種。這，我也早在「小貢　」那篇文章説過。是的，誠如殘月先生所説本書是「剪影集」的「世界文學史」。</p>
<p>正意説過了，我便有幾種聲明。殘月先生所懷疑的偉人的説話，原是從「西方革命史」轉述的ＫＭ的金言　其他兩句名言也是有來由的，望查一查「藝術與社會生活」及「文學與革命」。眞理始終是眞理，不怕是民十四五年，卽如再前在一八一八到一八八三年也還是一樣。同時，關於歷史材料之重用，也絕不是「古懂雜貨攤」。假定我在某些地方是抄了「趙景深老哥」的中國文學小史，那「趙景深老哥」就不是抄了漢魏以來的文人作品麽？殘月先生或許不至於承認「老哥」是創作的文學史家罷。他如關於批評的話，原是出版者所要求，卽如殘月先生所推崇的「趙景深老哥」的編著，就先有這一着。其實，這是一時流的壞傾向，殘月先生還不難發現目前各書坊所出的敎科書一類的東西，都有這無聊的一套。這些先生們的批評原是我應出版者代請來的。殘月先生如不信，可直接查詢出版者或原人。要特别加以括弧而有意魚目混珠　或許是借人的酒杯罷。綜之，淸算學術的空氣已開，我希望大家要完全以公正的態度出之。最後，我鄭重聲明我不是辛克萊的信徒，帽子的隆情，恕下壁還！</p>
<h3>讀「高爾基」</h3>
<p>— 林翼之</p>
<p>鄒韜奮先生於編輯生活週刋的冗忙的生活中，編譯了一部二十餘萬言的「革命文　高爾基」</p>
<p>，魯迅先生稱這本書「實在是給中國靑年的很好的贈品」。我想，每一位要對黑暗的環境，作永不妥恊的奮鬭的靑年，都應該接受這鄭重的贈物。</p>
<p>現世界最偉大的文學家高爾基的一生，是戰鬭的一生，他在第三自叙傳我的大學中曾經説過這樣的話。</p>
<p>「從這時候起，我深深的感覺到生活便是戰鬭。」</p>
<p>每一個今日中國的靑年，都在跋涉着高爾基所曾經跋涉過來的嶮阻的道程，我們要求着生存，我們就必須作堅苦卓絕的戰鬭，從高爾基一生所成就了的戰蹟中，不知有多少是値得我們勇敢地學取的。韜奮先生的這部書，在這意義上，是跟他所主編的生活週刋同樣，有不可　滅的功　　東　出入　　　　　　　　　　　　高爾基從一個鞋子店的學徒，廚子的助手，麵包師流浪者　躍登世界文壇的最高峯，這意義絕不是在於他個人的「立志成功」，如像其他許多所謂「偉人」的一般。他在這世界上的驚奇的出現，我們决不能與蘇聯在這世界上的出現，分開來去看的。十九世紀末葉俄羅斯的智　階級，整個的失却了他們社會生存的基礎，顯出了頽唐消沉的風氣，文壇上充滿了悲苦的啤吟，高爾基的出現，是代表着從地底層下抬起頭來的飢餓大衆的，因此他能夠攝住時代的心　，轉移於一個完全不同的新的Ｇｅｎｒｅ。但本書的叙述，却不免忽略這一主要的社會原因，不能不使我們認爲最大的缺憾。</p>
<p>在史實上也有不少的遺漏與錯誤，例如俄羅斯帝國學院之選他爲名譽會員，主要的原因是因爲一九○一年巴黎舉行雨果百年紀念大會，他受國際的聘請爲俄國文壇的代表者，使沙的忠臣們也不能抺煞他的地位。又如「母親」之作，是在九○七年被美國驅逐後，開始移住意大利蘇倫多時，並非在美國。</p>
<p>在高爾基與蘇聯政府的關係上，新生活時代的評　政府，及政府對智識階級的壓迫，完全是誇張的叙述。編者對俄國革命的認識，顯得非常薄弱，例如「全靠列寗的機智，很敏鋭的轉了方向，毅然採用新經濟政策方式的國家資本主義，」又如謂賴　可夫之被逐，爲與史大林失和等。有許多叙述，更顯得老大的矛盾：例如謂「布爾希維克獨裁的時候，在政治上的專制和壓迫和沙皇主義是一樣的，」但同時却説「開始就採用和以前大相反的敎育政策」。等等。</p>
<p>不過我們想着編者所根據的是一位布爾喬亞敎授的著作，則雖然不曾讀到原書，也可以明白這些矛盾叙述的源泉。那些巧妙的反蘇聯學者，儘可以一方面盛稱列寗一方面誣蔑俄國的革命，更不必説在記述高爾基的塲合，當然有許多機會製造他們的Ｄｅｍａｇｏｇｉｅ的。</p>
<p>最後不能不認爲遺憾的，本書對於最主要的高爾基的藝術的造詣，完全没有提到。</p>
<p>創作小説</p>
<h3>平凡的事（十四）</h3>
<p>— 𣽃果孫</p>
<p>廠工代表們以爲這是之光回答他們的話，因而以爲自己所要説的已經説完，所以其中有一個就説：</p>
<p>「張先生的話眞不錯，不接濟是立不住脚的！」</p>
<p>「我想救濟是必要的，」之光像是從夢中醒了過來説，「旣然閘北的事就是我們自家的事，不過現在是要姚先生答應呀！買單我肯救濟，並拿不出甚麽東西來！」</p>
<p>「我們希望張先生能　去勸姚先生。」好幾個人同時説。</p>
<p>「這自然是應當的，」之光説，「不過你們各位希望怎樣去接濟？用甚麽去接濟？」</p>
<p>「我們希望大家的接濟！不在乎現錢，材料也有用處，並且最緊要的，就是車子。」</p>
<p>「這自然不是我作得主的事，」之光説，「不過你們各位要我去勸姚先生，最好是我們能彀有充分理由可以使他馬上相信，我們能彀有具體辦法可以使他馬上照辦。剛才那幾句話究竟是　統一點，空蕩一點。」</p>

<h3>借貸美棉之利害與紡織業之關係劉靖基</h3>
<p>近因政府借貸美棉麥五千萬金元，引起朝野之論辯，各國之評議，每日報紙幾皆有此項消息之記載，或借此以攻擊私人，或以爲非此不足以救危困，或主張用之於生產建設，或認此爲飲酖止渴政策，皆因地位不同見解互異，而於分配辦法，尤多兩歧。故醖釀至今，雖歷一月有餘，而實際借貸條件，及採辦作價方法，迄未公佈。同業雖因利害關係，幾經小組磋商，終以政府未有宣示，無從討論。故在過去狀况　中　徒造成政府與人民之不安，而於我紡織業爲尤甚也。</p>
<p>關於政府方面者，一旦有此巨量之收入，引起各方索餉索債及請求補助之紛擾，且有因此而啟明爭暗鬭之舉，當局調停其間，固不免稍受精神之困苦，而實際受其影響者，仍屬我國民也。</p>
<p>關於紡織業方面者，當此消息初到之時，投機家利用機會，製造空氣，市面因之紛亂，買客因以觀望，紗價　跌十餘元，布跌三五角，一若美棉之來，市價低落有不知伊於胡底者。實則美棉進口，爲歷年所常有，不過向由商民視銷費之需要，市價之合否，陸續自購者轉而由政府躉批借貸，分期運華而已。在社會心理，以爲一旦借此鉅額洋花，必致供過於求，市面乃突起變化，紗價驟跌，廠商先受此無妄之累。初猶謂失之東隅，收之桑榆，尙有便宜之原料可待。乃日商乘機操縱，大收國棉，奸商惟利是圖，不惜爲虎作倀，更　成花紗背道而馳之象。華廠因循觀望，坐失良機，然猶以爲尙有最後之曙光。乃者美政府不惜以種種方法　達其膨脹通貨目的，先有每磅增加四分捐税之議，繼有摧毁棉苗四分之一之案，欲造成其人幼歡收之舉，用心之苦，手段之愚，姑不必論，而市價果因此續漲一二百磅音。我政府之借棉作價起運消息，杳然無期。廠商旣失機會於前，又坐視美棉大漲於後。環顧紗布走銷，又復如此悲觀。眞所調進退維谷，其困苦狀况，　超過二月前數倍。而减工停業之宣揚，反不如前之熱烈。請願救濟之工作，更無形停頓　殊足怪也。或曰紗廠前次减工，以生產過剩。今之行將停業，以原料缺乏。而未計及成本供求問題，此殆别有用心歟。我同業已至如此困境，倘不自謀根本補救，徒以借用美棉爲一時之幸事，恐前途危險，尙有甚於今日也。</p>
<p>關於棉價方面者，廠商現以五十元之原料紡廿支紗，以各廠通常計算，每包須虧本二十餘元。若用政府所借美棉，以現市核計，合每擔六十三元，勢非虧蝕七八十元不可。廠商自不肯舍輕就重，因此遂有美棉八折出售之謠，而政府則絕端否認。其實傳説者不過表明國棉祗含美棉八折之價，亦卽美棉商於國棉二成以上，以商情論之，美棉來華，非八折求售，不能與國棉符合。簡言之，卽非照國棉市價，無人受買，亦爲自然之理。故測度政府心理者，以爲將來必照公債折扣辦法，非抑價出售不可。更又以政府旣以救濟紗廠爲名而借美棉，則必使紗廠進花成本减低，不致再有虧折，勢非照國棉現市價格更再抑小不可。因此種種揣測，徒使人心惶惶，捉摸不定而根本之紗布，則反受此壓迫，每况愈下，大受打擊矣。</p>
<p>關於農村方面者，我國地大物博，以農立國己有五千餘年歷史。近年以天災人禍，農村經濟破產，棉麥米糧，莫不賴國外輸入以維持。漏巵外溢，至堪痛惜。然一方面猶可視國内消費之多寡，市面之盛衰，商人得酌盈劑虚，量力進止。一方面尙希政治安定，急切培植農產，以冀挽此狂瀾。今政府救濟農村之積極方法尙未實現，而以消極政策，借貸大批棉麥，在政府有此巨量收入，足以濟一時之急。倘其運華也，不問市價如何，消費如何，按期運到傾銷，勢必引起國内供求失平，影響於社會經濟及農產價格甚大。觳賤傷農，古有明訓。故不自謀根本振作，而引用外貨以爲可調濟民生者，蓋亦南轅北澈也。卽以我紡織界而論，原料取之農民，紗布行銷於民衆，商人承轉其間，爲自然之組織。今以國外之原料，製成紗布行銷於國内，農村未有如許原料代價之收入，而欲負此多量成品之消費，其購買力如何，已可逆料。故政府之借美棉曰籌欵則可，日救濟紗廠，則未敢承受也。抑又有進者，美棉市價高於國棉每擔十餘元，前文已略言之。以借額總値計算，僅市價相差，已須吃虧國幣三千萬元，其他費用及小麥損失尙在其外，此種市價損失，無論其負擔者爲政府，爲纱廠，而結果吃虧者，乃屬我國之人民，流出者仍爲我國之金錢，日後按期歸還，不能短少分毫，不論其借息如何低廉，條件是否適宜，以此額外損失三千萬元計，亦大堪玩味矣。綜上所言，此次借用棉麥之利害已可見。但願照立法院之提案，社會之輿論，除政府指定正用外，用之於生產事業，以作救濟農村建設交通之基金，俾國產棉麥得以振興，運输得以便利，而達復農興工之目的，方不負此次重大之犧牲，則非但我紡織界之幸，抑亦我民族生死存亡之關鍵，幸我紡織同業共起圖之。</p>
<h3>提高物價與通貨膨脹政策超構</h3>
<p>經濟會議開了四個星期，這幾天事實上已經擱淺。擱淺的原因，就在金本位國與非金本位國對於貨幣問題之爭執，美國主張非先提高物價，不能討論穩定貨幣之一切辦法；法國及所領導的用金國則主張一切討論須以目下貨幣之穩定爲前提，英國始終是在兩面遊移之間，因英雖爲停止金本位國之一，但對於美元的無限止的狂跌。確感不少的威脅，同時大英各殖民地又和美國有特别的關係，使英國不能無條件的加入金本位國的集團。四星期來的會議内容，不外是英美法三國的勾心鬥角而已！</p>
<p>所謂貨幣問題的嚴重性，完全是因物價問題而起的，因爲想從貨幣本身上找求解决物價問題，貨幣始成爲世界經濟問題的中心。一九二九年恐慌爆發后，世界物價約跌落二分之一，使生產者的負担非常增重，而同在生產者的地位，負担的程度又有差異，大致工商業方面比較可以限制生產等方法牽制物價的跌勢，農業方面則因所用原料多爲工業品，價格都高（例如肥料），所生產的又因生產過剩，價格低落，所受苦痛更甚。其次在農業以外的生產者，因戰後一時的好况，多擴張生產，所負的債務，以現在物價半落之故，不得不賣兩倍的商品以爲抵償；德國賠欵亦因物價下落，不能支付，賠欵停付，當然使歐洲對美的戰債動搖。　　凡這幾年來的恐慌，莫不以物價問題爲中心。</p>
<p>所謂提高物價，其目的就在救濟這一斑私人的或公共團體的債務加重之壓迫。以什麽手段提高物價呢？最簡捷的方法，便是把貨幣價値减低，卽以通貨膨脹的方法，抬高物價，大槪抬高的程度以回復一九二八年的物價水準爲目的。提高物價之后，對於私人的好處是負債减輕，購買力增加，可引起商工業的活况；對於國際的利益，是解除了債務國的壓迫，俾易於履行其債務。恢復債務國的信用，漸漸地廢除一切商業上之限制。所以：物價提高是資本主義國家心目中以爲打開不景氣的必要條件，但我們　知道，　　　　　　　　　　獨可以行得通的，如果一國的物價提高，則該國的商品　出當令馬上减退　　　　　增加，現金流出不已，不但找不回好景氣，經濟情况反令日趨劣勢。爲補救這一點，便不得不取金輸出禁止之一法了。但一國如果實行禁止金輸出，一方面可以提高國内物價，同時因本國貨幣價値下落，國内的高物價在國際上却是低廉，輸出自然增加，别國爲制止本國的貨幣流出與工商業起見，不能不採取兩種手段，其一是以同樣的禁金出口方法，减低本國貨幣，與停止金本位國作匯兑上的戰爭；另一是提高進口税率，作一關税壁壘，使對方的輸出利益受相殺，美國現在便是用前一方法。正因爲美國停止金本位，世界的匯兑戰爭便愈演愈烈。</p>
<p>正當的辦法，應該先停止各國的匯兑戰，恊定各國間的匯兑率，實行同步驟的通貨膨脹，各國一致提高物價，這樣固然没有那一國特别有利或受害，對於債務者的壓迫减輕是有大效力的。</p>
<p>但這是理論上的原則，橫在目前，却有幾個難關：第一：在目前世界黃金分佈不平均的條件下，要想設行一致的膨脹政策非常困難，有些禁金出口的國家，金準備早已减到最低限度，施行膨脹政策的餘地極有限，實際上能夠藉减低金準備率以膨脹通貨的，也唯有存金較豐富的英美法三國。假如其他的國家不能和英美法取同一比例的膨脹政策，則英美法當然也不願取此，因爲英美法三國單獨膨脹通貨，抬高國内物價，非禁金出口；實是無法以阻止輸入的激增，歸根到底，仍陷入目前的匯兑戰中。英美法的餘金，始終不能出國門一步，對世界經濟實毫無補益，從經濟的原則説來，黃金的集中於英美法，確有助長經濟恐慌的趨勢，非重新分配於各國，各國决不會有國際購買力，同時也難施行有效的國際通貨同比例的膨脹政策。第二：我們試檢查黃金有無重新分配的可能，我們知道資金的流動，普通有二種方法，其一是多金國對於他國的借欵投資，這在不安的空氣中壓根兒辦不到的，其次便要請多金國犧牲些，忍受入超的狀態，這也是走不通的路。現在最大的矛盾便是多金的英美法不肯站在入超的地位，所肯接受他國的商品，不肯流　　　　　　　　　　　　採取重商工義的　策，死守黃金，使黃金陷入所謂「不胎化」「呆　」的狀態中，所以，如果英美法不犧牲一點經濟上的利益，如减輕進口税，穩定本國貨　，金解禁等，則黃金必難有新的分配，世界物價也無提高的希望。第三：在施行一致的世界通貨膨脹政策之先，須確定各國貨幣的新平價，幾年來的混亂，舊平價已無恢復之可能，但新平價的確定仍是不容易解决的問題，各國大都未能抛去國家主義的見地，對於本國的貨幣平價總想較别國低一點，以求　易上的優勢，因而匯兑平價的估定就成了首先的爭執，其次縱有同意的匯兑協定，究以什麽手段維持呢？平價的維持須以商品資金之自由流通　前提，否則匯兑仍動搖不定，不免陷入新的匯兑競爭。我們一看英國之匯兑平　基金對於美金控制力景的薄弱，就可知穩定世界貨幣價値之困難了。</p>
<h3>憲法上之經濟問題茅震初</h3>
<p>立法委員兼　法起草委員吳經熊氏已將其所撰擬之「中華民國憲法」草案，刋布報端，公諸討論矣。論者每謂憲法爲政府與人民間之契約，故其含政治之意義多，含民生經濟之成分少。要知今日之世界旣非十七世紀盧梭民約論時代可比，而亦舍經濟必談政治，本無政治之可言。世界各國所以陷於經濟恐慌之深淵而不能自拔者，窮源竟委，何一非「資本主義之經濟組織」有以促成之？倘經濟無適當之解决，人民之痛苦亦一日不除。卽中國目前之狀况，内則社會不安，外則寇患日亟，言其總因，亦何莫非經濟衰敗爲之厲階哉？今吳氏草案，已刋有國民生計一章，固已注重經濟矣。惟一時感想所及，願就所見，錄以就商於有道焉。</p>
<p>按草案第四編第一章國民生計第一百八十六條：「經濟組織，應本於公平之原則，使國民均得維持相當之生存」。所謂公平也者，經濟組織也者，必如何始可使國民均得維持相當之生存？設政府志在維持以私有財產爲基礎，而以自由競爭爲原則之現存資本主義制度爲經濟組織之原則，吾人是否認爲公平？固知此種以個人爲單位之經濟組織，已爲過去潮流中之沉滓。此後自以全社會民衆爲單位之所謂經濟社會化者爲組織之原則，而以民生主義爲依歸。蓋民生主義者，用和平漸進之政治力，求全社會人民生產上與分配上之公平也。中國目前之患，在患「貧」，不在「不均」，故生產尤急於分配，然應同時注意於生產發達後之不均問題，而有以預防之。此中山先生於民生主義之實現，爲「節制資本」與「平均地權」之兩大政策，　寓分配公平之原則，於生產公平原則之中。作者之意，亦應以此兩大政策爲本條所謂公平經濟組織之原則，如條文文字改爲「全國經濟組織，應本於節制資本平均地權兩公平原則，使國民均得維持相當之生存」。不特明白定下何種公平之經濟組織，且可顯示民生主義眞精神之所在，與草案第一條「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」相吻合。</p>
<p>勞動乃生產之厲則，不勞動何由生產？欲求生產上之邁進，務使勞動量加增，欲求生產上公平，務使勞動者之普遍。草案第一百六十九條：「中華民國人民，俱有不背正義與人道，爲精神上或體力上勞動之義務」。及第一百七十條：「有勞動能力，非因怠惰或過失而失業者，政府應予以恊助，使有適當之工作機會，其有工作者，應由政府制定保護法規，以改進其生活」。似卽爲此而設。按民十二·十四兩次憲法中所擬之「國民有不背善良風俗爲精神上或體力上之勞動之義務」，一九一九年德憲所承認勞動爲一種道義之義務，舊俄憲之有强逼勞動，以及西班牙新憲法第四十六條「一切勞動爲社會之義務，應受法律之保護」。皆有此同樣之規定。然有勞動能力而不爲勞動之義務，應受何種制裁，並未提及。則此項勞動之義務，豈非有背公平之原則？如舊俄憲有「不勞動者，不得食」之規定，固屬不妥，若任其規避勞動，不加制裁，則勞動爲一種義務之説，便等具文。再者，倘有有勞動能力願爲勞動之義務，而苦無勞働之機會者，政府是否負責？或有有勞動能力，非因怠惰或過失而失業者，在政府恊助之下，仍未能得適當之工作機會者，政府是否更有其他如津貼金等補助方法，使其生存？此皆未背指示範圍，則於實行之際，能否不生疑問？甚難言之。</p>
<p>中國人民百分之八十以上爲農民，整個中國經濟體系，直農村經濟爲其台柱。如果一任農村經濟如目前之繼續崩潰，則全國經濟亦必隨而滅裂。（澈底言之，今且走上此滅裂之途）。目前農村經濟上最大困難爲：（一）農作物之收入，不敵地賦租税肥料種籽等之所出；（二）耕者無其田。故救濟之方，除積極的减低或轄免賦税，維護農產品價格，與夫重新支配耕田，務使眞正達到耕者有其田之目的外，别無良策。故草案第一百七十二條所訂關於發展農村經濟各欵事項，不容不加修正，尤其第六欵「改善佃農地位，增進農工福利」之空洞文章，不妨删除之爲愈也。</p>
<p>「釀成經濟之不平均，莫大於土地權之爲少數人所操縱，故當由國家規定土地法，土地使用法，土地徵收法，及地價税法。私人所有土地，由地主呈報政府，國家就價徵税，並於必要時依報價收買之」。此中國國民當第一次全國代表大會對於私有土地之限制也。此非中山先生對於土地之自然增價，亦主收歸公有。草案第一百七十六條，雖亦有「對於私有土地，應以法律規定，嚴防濫用荒廢，及集中於少數人」之明文，與上述意義相符。然詞意不甚完全，似應改爲：「對於私有土地，應以法律規定，嚴防濫用荒廢居奇及集中於少數人，政府並得就地主所起之價，徵税或收買之，所有因自然而增之價値，應歸公有」。</p>
<p>極度私有財產制之擴展，有違所謂「公平經濟組織」之原則，易言之，無異起接維護個人資本制度「不公平經濟組織」之陣綫。中山先生曾云：「民生主義之目的，在打倒資本制度」。故民生主義與資本制度在原則上勢不兩立。吾人旣奉節制資本爲經濟上公平之原則矣，當不容直接維護資本制度之私有財產制極度之擴展。在私有財產制目前環境未容完全廢止以前，應於憲法申明訂限制之條文，雖吳氏草案第一百七十九條有關於遺產承繼之限制，然遺產乃個人生前私有財產之積聚，於身後以遺留其繼承人者，與其限制其身後之遺留，何若對其生前之積聚，加以更嚴格之防止較爲妥善也。（原文爲：「對於遺產之承繼，應以法律或課税加以限制，但以不使承繼人喪失生存及發展本能之必要資力爲度」。）</p>
<p>發展國民經濟，捨開發實業末田。且依今日中國普遍的「患貧」之狀態下，更應盡量開發實業，從事生產，以救貧爲急務。開發實業之方案，吾人以爲不妨以「實業計劃」爲根據，提要規定，如建築鐵道，開濬河道等等，列　明訂，並規定用於開發各該實業之經費來源，務使不成具文，可以切實做去。草案第一百八十條所謂「爲謀國民經濟之發展，政府應提倡各種合作事業及保險事業」。吾人以爲合作事業與保險事業對於國民經濟之發展，實不能產生若何直接有力的力量，祗可謂在傍襄助經濟之發展而已，本條條文所訂對於發展國民經濟之事實，不無有舍本逐末之處也。</p>
<p>草案第一百八十一條：「凡具有專利性質或獨占性質之產業，應由政府集中資本爲獨立之經營」。須知在資本制度未被消滅以前，舉凡一切產業，均有專利與獨占之可能性。究竟何種產業，應由政府集中資本，爲獨立經營？未曾列舉。雖同草案第三編第五章中央與地方之關係各條文内，已略有涉及，還以彙列詳載爲宜。同時並應防止政府濫用此項權力，以免有損節制資本之眞諦。蓋政府設或見有有利可圖之事業，無不攫之以去，則此種橫逞高麽之舉動，誠於民生有害而無益也。</p>
<p>吳氏憲草中，關於民生經濟各條文之擬請斟酌修改者，或不止上述三數條。然其中可認爲較重大者，大抵僅止於此。昔孫叔通制朝儀，劉邦謂今而後知天下之可貴，在今日而制憲法，吾人以爲今而後知民生經濟之可貴，此吾人所以不得不致意也。</p>
<h3>北平社會經濟的一瞥程文藹</h3>
<p>一故都的總説　　吾人都知道，北平爲自元以來建都的所在地，皇城佔了北平整個的中樞，官氣充滿了故都的全境，紅頂花翎開　喝道這一類事，以其根深蒂固，還可以不時看見，一面又從歐風傳來，也有幾個摩登男女，摻雜其間，所以同時中西合壁起來，倒也覺得相映成趣呢！北平大部份的居民，在每天日上三竿的時候，恐尙在高枕，黃梁的萝裏。雖然，或者·因爲北平不是工商區域的緣故，所以大部份居民均度其安樂的生活，不過因此北平憑空多了這一大批特種失業的人數。最近有人主張劃北平爲文化區域。這辦法倒也不錯。不過有一點我覺得應當注意的，就是要排除惡習，否則設或文化也受了官氣的薫炙，那是前途不堪着想的。以下就北平社會經濟作一簡略的分析。關於面積和人口的統計，因爲本刋地位所限，茲從略。但據最近調查，百四十六萬餘人口中，無職業的居民男女，合計竟達九十萬零五千五百四十一人，換句話説，無職業者幾佔全市人口百分之六十一强，誠爲社會經濟前途一大危機。不過要曉得這種無職業者，就是上面講的一般貪吃懶做和依靠遺產的居民，與世界工業先進國家的失業問題不同。否則北平的社會經濟早呈大恐慌態度了。</p>
<h3>二工業的槪况</h3>
<p>北平因非工商業區域，故無工業之可言。大工廠的設立，可説是絕無僅有。足可叙述的，祗是手工業而已，在手工業中的最重要者爲地毯業，北平市地毯業，共有八十廠，資本總額三八六三六元，工人總數二三二○人，工資最高十八元，最低十元。其所以發達的緣故，是因爲無須鉅大資本，而且獲利亦厚，估計丈餘見方的地毯，售價在百元以上，其純利益約在二三十元左右。原料爲駱駝毛，大都來自張家口。考地毯業已有悠久的歷史，我國出品，其質地較波斯爲遜，但其花紋較舶來品爲好，並且成本低廉，故近二十年來，甚爲外人所歡迎，而以歐洲爲主要銷塲。北平地毯業中，以「成烈」公司的規模較爲宏大，在王府井大街　每年輸出外洋甚多。惟近年因有外人在我國設　　資本　　　並　　家計劃，利用機器織造，出　　　　　，　　　目，　　　國人不　　　，　守舊法的出品，不免要　失敗。次於地毯業的手工業，爲景　　　　　，其由來亦甚久。按　　　　　　　　，加以色澤　　，　　　四五次的　　而成者。以明代出品最爲　　，　淸乾隆時，出品雖花紋較　進步，然而色澤遠非明時可比，此可於故宫博物院中參觀時比較之。平地景泰籃琺瑯業共有二十八廠，資本總額三一六五元。工人總數四三八人，　資最高八元，最低二元。平地經營此業者，以燈市路的「京　行」規模最大。近年來景泰籃琺瑯的出口以輸入美國爲最多，每次總是大批運銷，不過大都是普通出產品，而且因爲是大量生產的緣故，所以對於製造方面，不克加以講究，銷路因之一落千文。其次爲紗燈，卽宫燈業，爲美術品之一，每年運銷外洋亦甚多，卽平地東交民巷各國使館中均有陳列。總之平地手工業在國際貿易上有關係者，不過如是而已。至於北平全市工業的狀况，據該市社會局最近的調查，可分别列述如下：（紡織工業）（一）地毯共八十廠，（二）織布共七十六廠，（三）織工共七二廠，（四）氈簾共二廠，（食品工業）（一）油酒錯共四坊，（二）食品共五廠，（日用品工業）（一）米廠一家，（二）製烟一家。（器具工業）（一）琺瑯共二八廠，（二）銅器共二七廠，（三）蜂具共七廠，（四）骨貨共十三廠，（五）帖套錦匣共十四廠，（六）小器具共十廠，（七）料器共十六廠，（機器工業）機器鐵廠共三十六家，（化學工業）（一）肥皂共八廠，（二）油漆一家，（三）火柴廠一家，（四）造紙二廠，（五）水膠廠一家，（服用工業）（一）皮件共七廠，（二）革帽共三廠，（三）眼鏡共七廠，（四）首飾共三家，（五）製鞋共七廠，（六）製底共五十一廠，（印刷工業）印刷廠共七家，（其他工業）（一）玉器廠共十八家，（二）標準器廠一家，（三）敎育品廠一家，（四）香廠二家，（五）紙花廠一家，（六）弓弦羊腸廠共五家，（七）刺繡公司四家，（八）花炮共五廠，（九）磚瓦共九廠（十）鷄毛廠一家。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>關於歡迎的二種</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>近二年來女上海眞是熱鬧得很，因爲旣經有了國難發生，而這一國難的打開，不獨有了政府的决心抵抗以至停戰恊定，就是外國的正人君子也很熱心。看他們不遠千里而來，自然是「亦將有以利吾國乎」。所以士大夫率領庶民，浣手燒香，虔誠以迎。</p>
<p>而最使我們不能忘懷的便是歡迎李頓調查團了。他們駕臨的任務，在招牌上寫得明明白白，譬如御史巡街，看着一個老頭兒給惡根打得頭破血流，只消輕輕的説上幾句公道話，也委胢以使老頭兒滿滿心歡喜的磕頭稱謝，口中呐呐稱道：「正義得伸，公理不滅。」於是伴駕遊覽長城，於是再四再三請他們一北戴河避暑。果然，這些老爺們費了攸久的歲月，給我們著了一部聖經，載明東北國際共管，以免大家眼紅。這一節，聰明如Ｘ博士者，自然是竭誠欽佩。可惜這部聖經畢竟不能使日方視爲法典，正相反，連熱河和長城都一併獨佔，以致老爺們不免發生不勝今昔之感。</p>
<p>然而我們對於這一團是曾經熱烈歡迎的，熱烈希望的，可憐現在祢落一塲空。一塲空！</p>
<p>但是現在又有另一種調查團來華了，這是法國巴比塞領導的各國的名作家之流。雖然這一團不像前者那般有聲有色，甚至於在報紙上也很少爲他們鼓吹，可是我們對於這班名流們多少總還知道一點。可不是嗎？他們都是反戰的急先鋒，他們在全世界廣大的民衆擁護之下而繼續艱困的反帝任務。巴比塞在去年國際反戰大會開會前，曾經對我們説過：「在遠東的日本侵略，是得了歐美列强的協定，爲了保障瓜分中國之目的而進行的。日帝國主義在滿洲之獵狗的敵對關係的開始，很明白的，是同時正對着蘇聯。」他又説：「現在戰爭又要到來了，這是你們可以透過眼前的烟幕而看出來的。那些戲子們爲和平軍縮的把戲所費的詞令，完全是無聊的廢話。」在這些詞句中，我們很可以看出他們共同的目標：反對日本佔領東四省，反對列强瓜分中國。同時新的戰爭又在開始，他給我們揭穿了和平的幻幕。</p>
<p>那未他們到中國來將有什麽行動呢？自然他們不會著聖經，因爲他們不是强國的代言人。而他們所必須做到的，乃是調查中國被侵略的慘狀，敎中國民衆在反帝的意義之下來認識「國難」，以革命民族戰爭收復東北失地。</p>
<p>所以，這一團和李頓一羣截然不同。讓我們以大聲呼號來，迎接這和平之友！</p>
<h3>探望</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>晚上睡得太遲，早上正好安睡的時候，在迷濛中耳畔被人低低地呌着，睜開惺忪的眼，菲對我扮着鬼臉説：「睡猪，早上凉快，起來，看你的朋友去」。</p>
<p>「小姐，住三等病房的窮鬼是没有這權利的！」我翻身起來，一邊推她到寫字檯的椅子上坐下，授給她今天的申報，自顧下樓去泡開水。</p>
<p>在樓下梳洗完畢了上樓，菲已等的不耐煩，「你倒底説什麽話？」她推了申報問我。</p>
<p>「菲」，我不能再開玩笑了，「你没有生過病嗎？三等病房我是住三個月的，但是不能等病痊愈，我寗願回到家裏來；醫生的馬虎，看護的不週，這是不問可知，就是朋友們的探望，也規定了時間，每天二時至四時，菲，一個臥病在醫院裏的人，他時時盼望着朋友們的來臨，這對於病人是莫大的安慰，我自己體味過這個來。」</p>
<p>「！還有這末大的規矩！」</p>
<p>「誰呌你窮人生病啊！」我苦笑着回答。</p>
<p>「這末早到那裏去呢？」菲表面上提起了别的問題，我知道她恐怕引起我的感傷。</p>
<p>「你到公司去吧，飯後我一個人去好了，天又這末熱。」</p>
<p>「來的時候我打電話給公司請假了，今天特地去參觀三等病房。」她説了無聊地翻着申報。</p>
<p>「菲，到文廟公園去走走吧，我每天到那裏去的，回來在附近吃了飯，一同到醫院去好嗎？」</p>
<p>「好！」她像孩子一般的跳了起來。</p>
<p>乘了半小時的電車，在一帶楓樹的蔭影下踏進醫院的門首。菲一路走説「養病倒是很好的地方」。在一個賣票櫃一般的窗洞中，我們簽丁名，回了口供，才有一位穿白衣的Ｍｉｓｓ領我們進ＸＸ號的三等病房。</p>
<p>癩痢頭兒子自己好</p>
<p>是一間很簡陋的平房，排着四張舖，所以適合於養病者，靠窗口是臨着那醫院的花園。我們推門進去的時候，四顆腦袋都熱情的盼望着我們，三個是失望了。我的朋友快活地説：「怎一路來的？」</p>
<p>「你的朋友？還是我的朋友哩！」菲返過身來對我説。</p>
<p>「噢」我忘了他們曾在我的小樓會過一面。</p>
<p>菲問過病狀　談了幾句醫院的情形，他儕着窗口去瞧那花園。</p>
<p>「錢，怎樣？」朋友輕聲問我。</p>
<p>「向菲借的」。我授給他四張五元鈔票，他躊躇着不就來接「生病的時候講什麽，你要問他借的可不肯借給你呢！（那是我指他的姨父）一末一句話我説得太高了，菲跑過來拍着他的肩胛説：</p>
<p>「靜靜地養病」菲似乎也感到悲哀的回味。</p>
<p>我的朋友感謝地瞥了她一眼，默默地接了錢。</p>
<p>六十分鐘很快的過去了，我們最後的一句話還是「靜靜地養病」，病人不自然的點點頭，説話已是那末輕：「有空再來看我一次，大槪一禮拜後我也好出院了。」我們没有「話」回答他，默默地出三等病房，出醫院門口，在一帶楓樹的蔭影下等候歸來的電車。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>民力</h3>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>在此外患内憂的我們貴中國，的確，鬧得不成樣子了！農村破產，亦其中之一也。雖然已有農業復興的高調，但事實又何嘗呢？</p>
<p>農村破產，儘管破產，官僚們的私爭自已的勢力，把農民剝削殆盡的事，却不可少的。四川等省即其例也。我們南方數省，雖然還未顯明的實行；但我有一個疑問，請敎先生了。就是我的家鄉丨無錫，近日正完納田税，我昨天在本報無錫通訊内，看登着：「額外征收」，大意是，「照上年的正附税外，又要加淸丈費每畝一角，保衛串捐每張二分。」但在先省廳已有「附税不得超過正税三分之一」的規定。而附税又要超過正税，分明是殘蹈省廳之令，此是何解？再有錫縣長恐抵觸省廳規定，就在征收處，另設淸丈費掣據處，派員收取，照此就不算附税了嗎？就不觸犯省廳規定了嗎？小子不敏，懇請先生敎我，則感激無涯矣。祝你</p>
<p>撰安何麟書</p>
<p>編者按；政府（一般的）是祇能消費，而不能生產的；政府爲着執行職務，而所需的費，當然要取諸於民。這種國家向民衆征收的錢，就是「税欵」。税的方法，各各不同：凡是專科於財力富裕的人民，而不及勞苦大衆的才是良税，反是則爲害民的税。我國現在的地價税（田賦），是最不合理想的一種税：不分田的價値，如宅地，耕地，荒地等（以前所定科則，至今已完全不能適用）不分業户的貧富（不用累進法）一律征收。這種税即使有了限制，切實執行，也是害民的。何妨在其他新的好的税，如所得税，遺產税，營業税，宅地税，以及其他一切奢侈品的特税等。還没有實行以前，這限制是永辦不到呢？你想新的好的税旣没有，政府現有的收入，只足供維持現狀之用。不破壞這限制，那麽現有事業的擴充，新興事業的經費，那裏來呢？我並不是贊成貴縣加税，不過以爲政府要用的錢，我們有拿出來的義務：不過要換個方法，不要擾及勞苦大衆就是了。一我一方面要設法制止不良的税，另一方面，却要提倡那合平理想的税才是。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（二十八）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（十六）丹麗，你不歡喜我了麽？</p>
<p>三姨太和李石喬在瑪琍飯店。</p>
<p>李石喬近來是弄得昏昏沉沉了。這昏沉却不是因爲三姨太之性的迷惑，而是他原有的生活計劃全失却主意了。所謂ＸＸＸＸ團體聯合會，通電是已經轟轟烈烈的在各報登出來了，但是接着應該作什麽事，他却全没有了主張，而且也不能有所主張，王化和陳天任的來往也是見密切，在這關係上，顯然已被王化喧賓奪主·最討厭的，錢還是一文也没有拿到，爲應付一般活動份子的塲面，他又不便表示窮態，事實上今天上午只吃了三個饅頭充飯饑；到現在晚間肚皮是餓得呌荒了·他本來就在三姨太面前説不出什麽挑動興趣的話，而今連説話的氣力和心思全都没有了。</p>
<p>三姨太不高興地把窗門用力關上，將他從昏沉中驚醒過來。起初他還以爲是閘北的砲聲震動得窗子響，抬頭看見三姨太那張帶怨的臉，才覺到三姨太最近已對他冷淡得多了。他不自然地向三姨太微笑起來，兩臂張開希望三姨太倒在他的懷裏；隨即兩手又埀落下來·好像有種説不出的理由非向三姨太討好不可，同時又覺得自己究竟太卑屑似的·這樣，他便無可如何地沉默着。</p>
<p>三姨太橫臥在床上抽香烟，仰起嘴吐出一肺的烟霧，而後又吹散那些烟，厭倦的看着平白的天花杯。忽的一鼓勁站起來，看住李石喬。</p>
<p>石喬也站起來，一手攔腰抱着她。</p>
<p>「丹麗，你不歡喜我了嗎？」</p>
<p>這樣，總算兩人抱着接了一個比較長時間的吻。照例，情人們的長吻總是沉醉地閉着雙眼的，但是兩人的眼睛不意間張開着，互相發現一種憂愁的分心，精神的倦怠。無論如何這是一個悲劇的不痛快的吻。三姨太這一吻更經騐地證明了厭倦的事實，而李石喬竟覺到一種不可名言的恐慌丨他覺得應該絕交的三姨太，現在竟惟恐失之可惜了。</p>
<p>「喬哥，你疲倦了嗎，我們睡在床上談談吧？」丹麗説。</p>
<p>「好的，我給你解衣服吧！」事實上石喬先替她脱襪子，那白嫩的大腿便架在他的膝上。他好像那上面有什麽香氣似的，用鼻子嗅了幾下。</p>
<p>「解扣子呀！」三姨太半撤嬌的喊。石喬連忙一手搭到她肩上，一路解下來　　「不冷嗎？」當他看見她的白肉已坦露了許多，便這樣問。另一隻手便將電滅了。</p>

<h3>好萊塢丨美國乞丐薈萃之所（上）</h3>
<p>— 西雲</p>
<p>明星們的慷慨害了他們每日所得優於辛勤工作　　「先生，求求你，我俄死了，請你賞我一杯咖啡喝吧。」他站在派拉蒙攝影塲的門口，衣服襤褸，但精神還好，年紀也不過三十多。這種人在好萊塢有上千之數，帶着狡獪的目光，悲哀的音調，舉止無定的脚步。他們是騙之不去，天天在門口，不是這個，就是那個。好萊塢明星們的慷慨和樂善好施的名氣，已經廣到美國的各地了。各地的乞丐，都不憚跋踄地來了。</p>
<p>派拉蒙的門口有乞丐，米高梅，雷電華，賓球以及其他一切影片公司的門口，亦都有乞丐。好萊塢是乞丐的樂園，討飯藝術家匯集之所。他們之中，還有帶賣鉛筆或蘋果的，但是他們或她們的目的，總不外乎討乞，明星們從來没有拿他們的鉛筆或蘋果的。餘了影片公司的門口，各飯店各旅館，各公共塲所，凡係明星們足跡所到之所，就有一般無業游民，各式各樣的乞丐，集攏來伸　手向他們告苦。</p>
<p>有一位好萊塢的記者，費了幾個星期的工夫，調查這種乞丐的生活。他每天到派拉蒙的門口，總看見那眼光游移不定的年輕花子。他每天都給他錢。到了第四天，那花子又向他討錢了，他就將他拉在一旁，問他每天能賺多少錢。他起初不肯講。後來那位記者又給了他些錢，告訴他他並不是暗探，於是那花子就講了。原來他不過二十九歲，可是做了職業的乞丐已經四年了。他在美國各大城，都行過乞，並且還坐過幾次監牢。但是全美國都没有像好萊塢這樣好的一個地方。他説好萊塢那個地方太好了，你向他們訴説些苦况，他們連忙擷腰包。他們賞賜的最少數是二角五分的銀幣。那記者又問他一天到底可以賺多少錢呢？他説「比作工好得多了。有一天賺了二十塊錢。但是我不在一處工作，不然的話，他們會看出來的」。</p>
<p>那記者又問他，那些明星們，人人給他錢嗎？那花子聽了，驕傲得很，他説凡是明星們，没有不給他錢的。希佛萊每次遇見他，總給他二角五分錢；迭克亞倫很慷慨；加雷古柏有幾次，一給號是半元錢。他又説討飯頂好是在影塲門口，因是那裏的人來來往往，明星們爲自己塲面起見，總没有不給錢的。</p>
<p>這位記者又跑到雷電華的門口，和那個賣蘋果的女子談了一下。她喊著「先生，太太，買一只蘋果，救救貧苦的女人吧。」她聲調悲慘懇切，雷電華的一般明星演員們，聽見了没有不給錢的。有十幾位演員，是她天天的好主顧。喬治傑賽有一天給了她五塊錢；安哈婷除了給錢之外，還給她舊衣服。那記者和她瞎談了一陣，就走開去隱藏在一個靜僻處看著。不到二十五分鐘，已經有五個人給她錢，但是没有一個人拿她的蘋果的。</p>
<p>電影學院的院長康拉德耐格爾，亦是一位明星。他常常遇見一個乞丐，一開口就會涙下涔涔的。他奇怪得很，後來據他親自調查，原來他從演員練習法裏得到了用密糖生涙的秘訣，他就靠此爲生了。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「老白相」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>當電影完全成了商品的現在，於是製片家唯一的企圖便是使這生產品迎合社會的心理而在其中攫取利潤。而且他們很知道，因着觀衆的知識水準不平衡，所以適合上層觀衆之口味的作品固然大有必要，同時迎合低級興趣的笑片，在他們的生產範圍中也成爲主要的部門。在新光和花園同時開映的「Ｃｏｈｅｎｓ　ａｎｄ　Ｋｏｌｌｙｓ　ｉｎ　Ｔｒｏｕｂｌｅ」便是屬於後一種的作品。</p>
<p>無疑義的，這部影片的製作，完全是爲了二位「老搭擋」的「妙趣橫生」而攝製的。和勞萊哈台一樣，爲了使觀衆哈哈大笑而從他們的腰包裏嘩啦嘩啦的掏出錢來。關於這二位仁兄，據説是作品不少，兩親家遊了菲洲又是好萊塢，也居然擠上了小丑的隊伍。他們從前的作品，可惜我都不曾看過，成績如何，無由得知。不過就這部新作品看來，却不見能夠十分引人發笑。平心説，假如以勞萊哈台相比較，那末不免遜色的了。事實上，他們的動作是滯鈍的，勉强的。比較的説，從一秘密酒窟裏喝了一肚酒出來，那種顚顚倒的步調，較爲眞切，可是在另一酒排間門前的彼此互相尋找，却又重覆的而見揉作了。總之，他們的笑料是生硬的，平庸的，没有内容的罷了。</p>
<p>至於故事的構成，更是空虚而無味。也許是完全爲了適合他們的表演才有如此的故事產生。加之又穿揷了一點毫不相干的愛情，自然是現代性的電影所必須完全的形式，然而顯然是太公式化了。</p>
<p>説到導演技巧，那末劇的庸俗平凡，自然導演負有主要的責任。然而在這樣膚淺的Ｓｔｏｒｙ中又敎導演家怎樣旋展呢，雖然導演並不能忽視故事的構成。　　總之，我以爲任何方面説，都難於發見他應有的價値。</p>
<h3>評「阿拉斯加的風光」</h3>
<p>— 靡蕪</p>
<p>在近一百度的酷熱天，據説看着雪山冰海的影片，能夠使人心身俱泰。但是像我這樣的人，總覺得夠使人凉一點的，還是冷氣管。新光映「冰雪緣」的時候，看的人十分多，是的確的；而光陸映「阿拉加的風光」，看的十分少，也是的確的。但這是閑話。</p>
<p>似乎用不到説了，有產者的生活平庸，所以他們的影片，不能不致力于神怪，鳥獸，以及自然美的表現，而忽略現實的社會生活，與社會關係。這張「阿拉斯加的風光」，就是介紹自升景物的影片。</p>
<p>像他的片名一樣，「阿拉斯加的風光」，就是「阿拉斯加的風光」。導演者不過用所謂「一隊游歷家」，帶了一羣獵狗把「阿拉斯加的風光」貫串了起來，因此在銀幕上，我們的演員，没有一點兒表演，只是帶了狗上船上飛機，從這兒到這兒，盡他的貫串風景的任務，導演者也只平庸的把「阿拉斯加的風光」，介紹給觀衆，所以嚴格的説：「阿拉斯加的風光」，只能算是一張新聞片，且也不見高明。就是片子開展的時候，用響帝的英語來説明片中的畫面，也是十足的新聞片的方式，普通的電影中應用，是會隔斷劇情的聯貫的。</p>
<p>但「阿拉斯加的風光」到底有一個故事的，所謂「完成其偉大的游歷」，不過這故事到底能夠告訴我們什麽呢？魯濱孖飄流記的出版，鼓動着當時的「英國商人」的航海貿易熱，菲洲及其他殖民地做背景而參以很多羅曼斯的影片的映出，能夠鼓動現代美國「人民」開發殖民地的興趣。而「阿拉斯加的風光」在拙劣的技術之下，連製作者這種目的，都達不到。要知道只靠「終于完成偉大的游歷」這樣的武斷的結束，是完全無效果的。</p>
<h3>范朋克夫婦離異説</h3>
<p>— 怡紅</p>
<p>好萊塢的婚變，本不算甚麽一回事，不過這次曼范的離異，實非尋常離婚案可比。彼等結褵十三載，且素以恩愛夫婦著稱。一個是昔日的影界皇后，一個是永久不變的武俠大王，這在影迷心中，是再佳不有的匹配了。</p>
<p>最近小范與大眼姐的婚變，雖屬出人意外，然二人皆在年少，屈强相持之下，勃谿之事，或所不免。若曼與范，皆可稱爲談情説愛之過去人矣，且一向分居，理應加增情愛，故不幸之消息傳來，輿論譁然，因無待言矣。聞此事之主動，係在曼麗方面。曼麗所持理由，「爲意見不合，無掛夫婦名義之必要」。果爾此案由醖釀而成爲事實，則夫婦偕來遠東之行，又將成泡影矣。</p>

<p>— 點點</p>
<p>約定付欵的時間到了，而拍拉特仍姗姗來遲。一再敲門的聲音，進來的郤是許多要差使的男女。霍金斯以及寳莉等歌女舞星一齊等候得有些不耐煩了，許多女子絡續的正在要去，房門又抨然一聲開了，進來的居然是拍拉特。拍拉物説對不起，要他們等候，並不拿出欵子來郤説要奏鋼琴。霍金斯的眼睛轉視到寳莉。寳莉侷促不安的對拍拉特説那件事怎能尋開心呢？霍金斯跑到門口説他要鎖門了，呌各人出去。拍拉特莫明其妙，説他不再要那笨欵子了嗎？</p>
<p>拍拉特抽出一個飽滿的皮包，把一張一張新鈔票點數完畢，便伸手給霍金斯説「一萬五千丨現欵。」霍金斯像被迷了似的拿了錢，不相信似的看着那少年。寳莉最爲喜出望外，她一雙水汪汪的媚目　着拍拉特，一往情深盡在不言中了。</p>

<h3>Xue Lei in Tangshan Negotiates Four Measures</h3>
<p>Negotiations Briefly Encountered Setbacks, Li Jichun's Title Remains Undetermined, Shi Yousan's Troops to Be Handled Separately</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Arrives in Beiping to Meet Huang, War Zone Set to Be Received Starting on the 21st</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong and Xue Zhiheng went to Tangshan to meet with the puppet army leaders Li Jichun, Zheng Yanhou, etc., and have negotiated four measures for reorganization: 1. The puppet army will be organized into two major detachments and six companies, each company with one thousand men, and a special service detachment of one thousand men, totaling four thousand men, stationed north of Luan County, south of Ning'an, and in the Fengrun County area east of Ping. 2. The reorganization committee will supervise the disbanded puppet army, giving each man 20 yuan as a dismissal fee, and sending them back to their hometowns. Those with firearms will be given 50 yuan. The total reorganization fee is estimated to be about 200,000 yuan. 3. Li Jichun's title has not yet been determined. Zheng Yanhou and Pan Yugui will be appointed as security team leaders by the Political Reorganization Committee. After the puppet army is reorganized, all officials appointed by the war zone will be dismissed. 4. The more than one thousand troops of Shi Yousan in Qinhuangdao will be handled separately, directly contacting the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters. Xue Zhiheng is waiting for the Kwantung Army representative Kita to meet in Tangshan to agree on the four reorganization measures for the puppet army, and then return to Tianjin to report and convene a plenary committee meeting. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Tangshan, Zheng Yanhou, the commander of Li Jichun's forward troops, commands four infantry brigades, one cavalry brigade, and one special brigade, with very strong forces. Li's current status is all due to Zheng's promotion. Zheng, with his high merits, is unwilling to be subordinate to Li. This time, during the reorganization, it was proposed to appoint Zheng as the commander of the special police detachment, commanding two thousand men. Zheng resolutely opposed and resigned to Li. The brigade commanders of Zheng's troops also expressed their willingness to advance and retreat with Zheng. Li's directly commanded troops are only four echelon units with limited strength, and he can do nothing to Zheng, causing the reorganization problem to be greatly affected. Lei Shourong returned to Tianjin by special train on the evening of the 15th to report to the committee members. Xue Zhiheng went to Jiaotong University at 2 pm on the 15th to discuss remedial measures with Li and persuade Zheng to consider the overall situation and not resign. Zheng's attitude has eased slightly. After being retained by all circles on the morning of the 16th, he is expected to cancel his intention to resign. On the morning of the 16th, Xue met with Li again to continue discussing the reorganization measures. They dispersed at noon and waited for the reorganization fee to be remitted before starting the reorganization. It is rumored that Li stated that he would not accept the title of chairman of the reorganization committee because it was temporary, but he expressed that he could accept the title of commander of the war zone training, but the provincial authorities believed that the word "commander" was a special appointment, parallel to the provincial chairman, which seemed inappropriate, so it has not yet been decided. Someone is secretly instigating Li's troops to seize territory. The provincial government has decided to send personnel to various counties to take over political power starting from the 20th, which may be difficult. In the future, after Li's troops are reorganized, although the takeover can proceed smoothly, there will be many complications in Fengrun, Luan, and Qian'an counties, because Li's director of the Department of Political Affairs, Liu Jinbiao, is very arrogant and has no intention of ending. Lei Shourong arrived in Tianjin from Tangshan at 1:30 am on the 16th, and at 6 am, he went to Beiping by special train with Yu Xuezhong, Yin Tong, and the county magistrates to meet with Huang Fu to report and ask for instructions. It was decided to return to Tianjin on the 18th to receive the detailed rules for the operation of the War Zone Reception Committee and the reception procedures. It was decided to submit it to the committee for discussion and approval on the 18th, and to officially start working on the 20th. The number of special police forces to be organized is still undecided and will be determined based on future circumstances. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping from Tianjin this morning. The reception committee member Yin Tong and the seven county magistrates of Luan East came with him. Yu said in a statement that the war zone reception has been decided to start on the 21st of this month and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The county magistrates of the nineteen counties in the war zone have all been appointed and will depart separately on the 21st to proceed to various counties to handle the reception matters. The puppet army in Luan East will be reorganized into one major detachment, divided into six units, and a special service detachment will be organized. The position of commander of the major detachment was originally intended to be filled by Li Jichun, but because Li declined, it has been changed to be filled by Zheng Yanhou. The position of commander of the special service detachment will be filled by Pan Yugui. A total of four thousand men will be organized, and the rest will be dismissed and sent back to their hometowns. Those with guns will be given fifty yuan, and those without guns will be given twenty yuan. Shi Yousan currently has more than one thousand troops stationed in the Qinhuangdao area and will be handled separately from Li Jichun's troops. They may be incorporated in the future, but the affiliation of the agency has not yet been decided. The central government has decided to allocate 5 million yuan for the relief of the North China war zone and has ordered the Ministry of Finance to quickly remit 1 million yuan. The remaining 4 million yuan will be issued in public bonds. The issuance regulations have been drafted by the Hebei Provincial Government and will be submitted to the Political Committee for approval today. They will be issued in Hebei Province in the future. The donations and taxes of the nineteen counties in the war zone will be completely suspended to relieve the people's difficulties, but it is still undecided whether the additional donations used for local public welfare matters will be exempted. Hao Peng has now been released. When Hao was captured by his subordinates and sent to the First Army, the Japanese immediately demanded that he not be disposed of temporarily and later demanded his release. It is rumored that Yu will meet with He and Huang tomorrow to discuss the war zone and the reorganization of the puppet army and lead the seven county magistrates who came to Beiping to meet Huang and listen to instructions. He will return to Tianjin tomorrow afternoon. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong has left Tangshan and is scheduled to arrive in Beiping tonight to report on the progress of the Tangshan negotiations. Li Zeyi went to Tangshan last night to assist Lei and Xue in handling the negotiations. Li telegraphed from Tangshan today, reporting that the puppet troops in various places can withdraw from Fengrun and Luan County before the 21st. After the puppet troops withdraw, our side can send the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs to take over. Huang Fu is scheduled to convene the county magistrates in Beiping at 9:00 am tomorrow to give instructions in the conference hall of the Political Reorganization Committee. After the meeting, the county magistrates of Pingdong and Pingbei will stay in Beiping and depart from Beiping to various counties in the future. The county magistrates of Luan, Tang, Qian'an, and Lulong will return to Tianjin and travel to the north by the Beining train. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Ming will lead the county magistrates of Pingbei to take over within days. Shi Yousan is commanded by the Japanese Garrison Army. His troops are less than ten thousand. He has set up a cadre school in Qinhuangdao. Because the arrogance of the Garrison Army is still high, the resolution of Shi's troops is difficult. Li Jichun is commanded by the Japanese Kwantung Army. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lei Shourong returned to Tianjin from Tangshan at 1:00 am on the 16th to report on the negotiation process. Xue is still staying in Tangshan to continue discussing the issue of incorporating the puppet army, which is becoming more specific. The reorganization can begin on the 21st. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of reorganizing the puppet army has been progressing smoothly since Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong went to Tangshan and contacted Li Jichun. Li has ordered his puppet army troops to gather in the Luan County area to await inspection. The reorganization can be completed in approximately three to five days. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Progress in the Chahar Situation</h3>
<p>Li Qi Has Not Yet Telegraphed to Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the atmosphere of peaceful resolution of the Chahar affairs is strong, there is actually no progress. Li Qi has not yet telegraphed to Beiping. It is rumored that Feng's attitude has recently changed, but many of his subordinates still insist on their original demands. Feng Guren is feeling quite difficult. It is difficult to predict whether Li Qi's re-visit to Zhangjiakou will have a satisfactory result. It is expected that Pang Bingxun's advance troops have arrived in Zhuolu. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai Plans to Recover Changting</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Cai Tingkai flew to Yongding on the 14th to witness Zhang Yan's oath as the commander of the 49th Division, and immediately returned to Yan, where he will convene a military meeting to plan the advance to recover Changting. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Tan Qixiu flew from Zhangzhou to the province on the morning of the 16th. The supplementary division, in addition to the original supplementary brigade and special service regiment, will be merged with the security brigade of Chen Weiyuan. Tan will serve as the division commander, and Chen will serve as the deputy division commander. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dai Chuanxian Went to Gan Yesterday to Meet Chiang, Preparing to Go to Xinjiang for Propaganda</h3>
<p>Rumor Has It That Dai Is Going to Lushan for Recuperation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang and Wang have a unanimous opinion on borrowing Dai Jitao to go to Xinjiang for propaganda. Chiang telegraphed Dai, asking him to reluctantly take on the difficult task and to go to Gan to discuss the principles for handling the Xinjiang affairs. Wang also persuaded him nearby. Because Dai could not refuse, he agreed and took the Longhe ship to Xun on the 16th, transferred to Lushan. Chen Yi, Gu Zhutong, and Huang Musong's attendant Zhang Cheng and others traveled together. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Daqi, the deputy chairman of the Examination Committee, said that Dai went to Gan because he was going to Lushan for recuperation due to illness. Also, a certain agency reported that Dai had submitted a request to the government for leave before going to Gan. The original request stated that he had been frequently asking for leave recently. Now that his illness has not healed, he has decided to go to Lushan on the 16th for recuperation, and intends to continue to ask for leave for two weeks for recuperation, and asked to be informed for verification. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In addition to Zhang Cheng and Li Huaying, the advisors sent back by Huang Musong also include Xia Zhongyi, Wang Yingyu, Qian Tong, and five others. Wang got off the plane in Xi'an, and Qian went to Beiping. Li said that Huang's envoy was ordered to return to Beijing, has ended everything, and is preparing to go east, and instructed the staff of the embassy to return to Beijing one after another. Huang himself will take the next week's Eurasia plane to go east. The central government has a solution for the aftermath of the Xinjiang affairs, which should be realized within this week. Xia said that Huang was originally scheduled to come with us, but Liu Sheng stayed behind for Huang to meet with Gong Peng before leaving. The rumors about Huang are all exaggerations. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the incident in Xinjiang occurred, Chairman Chiang and President Wang have repeatedly urged Dai Chuanxian, who is familiar with the situation in the Northwest, to go to Xinjiang for propaganda. Dai only agreed to consider it. Chiang urged Dai to set off as soon as possible, so Dai took the Yihua ship to Gan on the morning of the 16th to meet with Chiang, and will return to Beijing in about a week. Chiang and Wang also asked Zhang Fengjiu, the director of the Xinjiang Provincial Office in Beijing, to be Dai's attendant. The date of Dai's departure will be determined after he returns to Beijing. In addition, the central government sent Gong Bicheng and Peng Zhaoxian to Xinjiang first. Gong and others have been scheduled to take the Eurasia plane on the 18th. Li Hua, the counselor of the Xinjiang Propaganda Envoy Office, recently returned to Beijing. According to him, Huang Musong is safe and sound. The misunderstanding between Sheng Shicai and Huang was actually caused by the alienation of villains. Now that the truth has been revealed, Huang will be able to return to Beijing soon. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Wang Yingyu, the deputy chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and Qian, the director of the Ping Ancient Relics Exhibition Hall, who previously accompanied the Huang Reassuring Envoy to Xinjiang, arrived in Xi'an by Eurasia plane on the 14th. According to Wang's interview with reporters, the second incident in Xinjiang was not as serious as rumored. The misunderstanding about Huang was also the result of a third party's instigation. Now that Huang's mission has been completed and the central government has telegraphed him to return to Beijing, he plans to fly to Beijing to report after Gong Bicheng arrives in Xinjiang. As for the military aspect, Ma Zhongying's troops are stationed in Hami, Guchengzi, and Turpan, Sheng, Liu, and the Eastern Province troops are stationed in the Dihua area, Zhang Peiyuan's division is stationed in Lixiao City, and there are battles between Sheng and Ma. Zhang has no expression, but all obey the central government. If the central government can send senior officials to handle it, the situation will not worsen. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mongolian Committee and Dalai Lama's Representative Negotiate Peaceful Measures for Kham and Tibet</h3>
<p>Gesang Zeren Will Be Sent to Tibet to Meet with the Dalai Lama</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Committee, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Dalai Lama's representative, Gungchoong Nyima, have negotiated peaceful measures for Kham and Tibet, which will be forwarded to the Dalai Lama by Gungchoong to seek his opinion. It is planned to send Gesang Zeren to Tibet to meet with the Dalai Lama. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gesang Zeren, a border affairs commissioner of the General Staff Headquarters, said that the conflicts in Kham and Tibet, the civil war in Sichuan, the Mongolian issue, and the unrest in Xinjiang are purely the division of the five races. If we do not urgently seek unity, it will create an opportunity for strong neighbors to invade. In a few decades, the border territories may not belong to us. Therefore, all research and rectification plans have been submitted to the central government for reference. As for the conflicts in Kham and Tibet, I received a telegram from Kangding three days ago stating that the two armies are still confronting each other on the Jinsha River. Although both sides have stopped military action, it could break out at any moment. Therefore, the outbreak of the Sichuan war has greatly affected the situation in Kham. Recently, the generals in northern Sichuan hope that Liu Wenhui will enter Kham and take full responsibility for Kham affairs in order to seek self-rectification of Sichuan's military and political affairs. A few days ago, in order to study border affairs issues, I telegraphed Chairman Chiang and President Wang, and telegraphed Supervising Officer Liu Xiang, suggesting that the affairs of Sichuan and Kham should be considered together to avoid future changes. Furthermore, the first incident in Xinjiang was caused by Jin Shuren's unkindness, which triggered a civil uprising. The second incident was a political change caused by a misunderstanding. Although it has been slightly quelled, I fear that there are villains sowing discord in the meantime, and there may be future troubles. Therefore, the central government is still carefully considering the personnel issue for the military and political authorities in Xinjiang. It must be someone who is compatible with virtue and is admired by the people of Xinjiang before they can be appointed, so as to avoid worries in the west. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yu Hanmou Convenes Bandit Suppression Meeting in Dahui</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yu Hanmou returned to Dayu on the 15th and scheduled a bandit suppression meeting on the 20th. Li Zhenqiu, Ye Zhao, Chen Zhang, and Li Hanxin will all attend. Yu recommended Li Hanxin as the deputy commander of the First Column. Chen Jitang decided to set up the Southern Route Command in Dahui, and the command posts of the First, Second, and Third Columns will be set up in Ganzhou, Jiaoling, and Longyan respectively. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Zanbin telegraphed on the 14th that the 13th sent Ling to press the Xituan to attack the bandits in Tongluowei, Anyuan. On the afternoon of the 14th, the siege was broken, killing more than 60 bandits and capturing more than 50 women. Also, Yu Hanmou telegraphed on the 14th that more than 800 bandits suddenly arrived at Daqiaotou Market near Xinfeng on the 13th and were repelled by the Ye regiment at Hanwu, killing more than 20 bandits. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Li Hanxin is about to be appointed as the forward commander of the First Bandit Suppression Column. His troops in northern Guangdong will also be dispatched to join the suppression of the communists in southern Jiangxi. Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Column, arrived in Dayu yesterday. The bandits in the Changting area of southern Fujian have gradually been cleared by the 19th Route Army and have the shape of abandoning the city and fleeing to Ruijin. Once the bandit troops in Changting are withdrawn, the communist forces in Fujian can be completely eliminated. The provincial government is now ordering the bandit troops in Haifeng and Lufeng to surrender and reorganize them. Chen Jitang believes that some of the bandit troops were forced by the situation and went astray, so he specially ordered them to have the opportunity to reform themselves. Zhang Da, the commander of the Fifth Division, has approved the surrender of 4,000 bandit troops. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Supervisory Committee of the Palace Museum Will Be Established Immediately</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Provisional Supervisory Committee of the Palace Museum, which is planned to be established, will be established in Shanghai within a week.

All the expenses for the southward relocation of cultural relics this time have been compiled into an estimate, which has been submitted to the board of directors for approval and submitted to the Central Political Conference for review. The total estimate is 430,185 yuan. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Country Bent on War Borrows Money to Get Through the Days, Like a Skeleton Firing Guns and Cannons</h3>
<p>Wakatsuki Gives a Speech on Japan's Financial Weaknesses</p>
<p>Takahashi Fantasizes About a Sino-Japanese Economic Alliance</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito party held a discussion meeting on the 15th. The main points of President Wakatsuki's speech are as follows: Japan's current financial problem is very important. Although Japan's economic power is capable, its financial aspect has many weaknesses. It lacks 150 million yuan every year. If it borrows 150 million yuan every year, the national finance cannot be maintained. This 150 million yuan is the cost of the Manchurian Incident and the cost of improving military preparations. The essence of Japan's current situation is the same as the wartime state. However, the wartime state must not be allowed to deal with things by borrowing money. Preparing military equipment and improving national defense are of course necessary, but I remember that thirty years ago, when Italy was expanding its military equipment, someone drew a picture of a skeleton carrying a gun. Disregarding the financial situation and the people's hard work, improving military equipment, and having the skeleton fire guns and cannons is really useless. Japan's public debt currently has 8 billion yuan. As this evolves, it will soon reach 10 billion yuan. The interest on this public debt is more than 600 million yuan, accounting for one-third of the revenue. This burden will fall on our children and grandchildren. We must work hard to solve this important national problem. Britain borrowed money to pay for military expenses during the war, and after the war, it increased tax rates to sort out public debt. I believe this is the most solid way. (16th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) President Wakatsuki's speech yesterday advocated increasing taxes, which has attracted attention. It is widely believed that the Minseito party plans to suggest tax increases when the government prepares the budget for the next year. (16th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Takahashi has been staying at the Hayama Villa in Zushi to recuperate since the 5th of last month. Takahashi spoke to reporters on the 15th about the current situation, saying that the World Economic Conference had failed. In today's state, it is impossible for countries on the gold standard and countries that have left the gold standard to jointly study policies. Therefore, the two sides have to temporarily separate. According to my observation, countries are rebuilding trade relations on the basis of mutual benefit, and if this cannot be established, they will return to the state of free trade. What attitude should Japan take in the future? Japan has previously underestimated the Ottawa Conference agreement. In the future, exports to British colonies will not be smooth, so it is necessary to open up new markets. The United States has begun negotiations on reciprocal treaties with South American countries, and Japan should also develop in that direction. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently established a committee to consider this issue, but in my opinion, the private sector should first open up the path, and then the government should actively assist, which is better. I think it is too early for "Manchukuo" to adopt the gold standard, because Japan will need to organize an economic alliance of Japan, China, and Manchuria in the future, and China is on the silver standard, so Manchuria's adoption of the gold standard will not be effective. As for the naval replenishment plan, the Ministry of Finance is also studying it. The purpose of the United States' naval expansion plan is to inflate the currency and relieve unemployment, and should not be mixed up with Japan's plan. The current financial situation is quite slow, but individual resources do not have the capacity to subscribe to public debt, so now is not the time for public offering. I believe it is best for the Bank of Japan to first purchase it and then sell its public debt on the market. (16th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The budget for the next year is currently being prepared by various ministries and can be submitted to the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance for review by the end of this month. The Tax Bureau will conduct a detailed investigation of the implementation status of the huge budgets of Showa 7 and 8 (1932 and 1933), and study the policy for examining the budgets of various ministries for the next year. In the budgets obtained by various ministries in the above two years, many used the excuse of the current situation to remedy and other extraordinary periods to obtain it. Observing the results of the implementation, the expenditure that does not conform to the extraordinary situation has reached a considerable number. In view of this fact, the Budget Bureau decided to reduce the new budgets of various ministries by half. (16th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Uchida Hopes for Military and Political Affairs and Civilian Rule to Go Hand in Hand</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Establishes the Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida believes that the work of suppressing bandits in "Manchukuo" has come to an end, and that today is a period when military and political affairs and civilian rule go hand in hand. In order to adjust the Manchuria-Mongolia policy, it has been decided to establish a new Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The cost is estimated to be 70,000 yuan and will be formally decided at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Budget Meeting on the 25th. The contents of the Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau establishment plan are as follows: (1) The newly established Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau will specialize in handling matters related to "Manchukuo." (2) Three sections will be established within the Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau. The first section will handle obstacle matters in "Manchukuo." The second section will handle general matters within "Manchukuo." The second section will implement investigations and plans regarding "Manchukuo." (16th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Disarmament Conference in 1935 will not only discuss disarmament issues, but also discuss Far Eastern issues.

<h3>Hidden Currents in Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the settlement of the Seiyukai's internal strife, the political situation has temporarily calmed on the surface, but various maneuvers are still happening internally. Consequently, public expectation has shifted from President Suzuki to Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki. Some within the party are even advocating for Marshal Muto. However, the movement for a Seiyukai-Minseito coalition cabinet by the self-respecting faction of the Seiyukai, and the movement for a national unity cabinet led by Fusanosuke Kuhara, cannot be underestimated. Ryuji Nagashima and Kunitoshi Tsugumo of the Kuhara faction are currently active on the Minseito and Kokumin Domei (National League) side. Meanwhile, from the Minseito party, Kojiro Tomita, Katsura Yorimoto, and Katsumi Kawasaki met with Governor-General Ugaki while he was in Tokyo. Some leaders of a certain faction also met with Governor-General Ugaki to prepare for the next cabinet. Therefore, President Wakatsuki must adopt a self-restrained attitude during this period and strive to maintain the Saito cabinet. Because there is no confidence in overwhelmingly defeating the Seiyukai in the next parliamentary dissolution, it seems that there is a sense of inadequacy in various areas. However, the current cabinet is facing concerns due to the health issues of the Minister of Finance before the compilation of the next fiscal year's budget. Therefore, given this situation, there are fears that the political situation may experience turbulence in early August, and potentially worsen in September. (16th Datong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ishii's Speech Vigorously Courts the United States</h3>
<p>Hoping for U.S.-Japan Political and Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Plenipotentiary Kikujiro Ishii broadcast the following speech to the United States at 6:30 PM on the 16th: The United States and Japan are destined to cooperate in political and trade relations. The trade between the two countries is as close as lips and teeth. On various issues discussed at the World Economic Conference, the United States and Japan often hold common ground, such as the issues of trade barriers and ship subsidies. As for the silver issue, Japan has close relations with silver-using countries and stands in the same position as the United States. I firmly believe that the Economic Conference will create beneficial achievements for the economic recovery of humanity, and Japan will spare no effort to achieve its goals. (16th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the complex entanglement of interests between various countries at the London Economic Conference, proposing multilateral agreements and treaties to restore the economy is extremely difficult. The recent trend is to conclude individual agreements between countries based on reciprocity, hoping to balance exports. This effort is gradually gaining traction. The United States is particularly committed to this movement, not only adjusting trade between the two countries based on reciprocal treaties but also potentially providing economic and financial assistance to the other country to indirectly promote trade. Therefore, Japan naturally supports this proposal. While developing Japanese-Manchurian enterprises, Japan also aims to secure the principle of free international trade and has decided to engage in individual negotiations with various countries, rather than relying on ceremonial international commercial agreements, to adjust trade relations with the goal of increasing mutual benefits. This decision will be submitted to the newly established Trade Deliberation Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which will establish a new trade policy based on this principle.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, financial aid strategies are popular for countries with reciprocal individual agreements and for promoting trade with partner countries. The main ones include: 1. The United Kingdom concluding reciprocal agreements with Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, mutually importing and exporting a certain amount of agricultural products from Northern European countries and coal, yarn, cloth, and machinery from the United Kingdom to reduce tariffs. 2. Countries such as Turkey only allowing imports from countries to which they export. 3. The United States, through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, lending money to Soviet Russia and China to export cotton and wheat. (16th Datong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Production Party's Grand Conspiracy Fully Exposed; Uchida, Suzuki, and Wakatsuki All Targeted for Assassination</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Following a thorough investigation of the Production Party, which was previously apprehended by the Metropolitan Police Department, a conspiracy was discovered at 9:30 PM last night. It was revealed that Zenichi Suzuki, who had been known as the leader, was actually a staff member. The true leader was Torao Maeda, formerly of the Xingguo Farmers' Alliance. His subordinates were Seiji Kamiyama, a student at Kokugakuin University; Seizo Muraoka, a member of the Xingguo Farmers' Alliance; and Zenichi Suzuki. Their plan was to attack gun and ammunition shops in the city at 11:00 AM on November 11th. After obtaining weapons, they would divide into three teams. One team, led by Torao Maeda and guided by Suzuki, would attack the Metropolitan Police Department at Sakurada Gate. The second team, led by Muraoka, would attack the Prime Minister's residence. The third team, led by Kamiyama, would attack the headquarters of the Seiyukai, Minseito, and Kokumin Domei, as well as the residences of Count Nobuaki Makino, President Suzuki, and President Wakatsuki, intending to stage a second May 15th Incident. The Metropolitan Police Department has largely completed its investigation, and the conspiracy has been fully exposed. At 9:30 PM last night, police officers were dispatched to the home of Kinjiro Tadokoro, a former secondhand dealer in Onden, Shibuya. A search resulted in the discovery of forty-one Japanese swords to be used in the attack on gun and ammunition shops. (16th Datong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Reinforcement of Korean Garrison Difficult to Implement for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Governor-General of Korea had intended to relocate the 14th Division of Utsunomiya to Manchuria and permanently station three divisions of troops in Korea. However, Governor-General Ugaki met with Army Minister Araki during his last visit to Tokyo to discuss and coordinate. The Army Minister replied that Manchuria had returned to normal and that it would be difficult to give a definitive answer until the Showa 10th fiscal year. Furthermore, the General Staff Headquarters and the Army are prioritizing the reinforcement of the Kwantung Army. Therefore, the reinforcement of the Korean Army is likely difficult to achieve for the time being. (16th Datong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway Proceeding with Informal Contacts</h3>
<p>Hoping to Break the Stalemate</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the negotiations for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet side, recognizing the futility of continuing the discussion on ownership, discussed the issue of price during the fifth meeting on the 14th, indicating a slight shift in the direction of the meeting. Furthermore, the Soviet Union, recognizing that future negotiations would inevitably involve delicate points such as price and payment terms, and deeming the conventional format of meetings inappropriate, agreed with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is mediating the negotiations, to have the "Manchukuo" Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ohashi, and Kazinovsky, the head of the Far Eastern Department of the Soviet Union, conduct negotiations privately. Therefore, depending on the outcome of the next meeting, the Southern representative will hold private talks. (16th Datong Telegram)</p>
<h3>World Economic Conference: Plan to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative Has Drafted a Resolution</p>
<p>(London) The U.S. representative at the World Economic Conference is still considering a plan to raise prices worldwide and has drafted a resolution. However, it is questionable whether it will be submitted before the conference adjourns, as the U.S. representative does not want to revive the debate between gold-standard and non-gold-standard countries. However, the U.S. representative still believes that stabilizing currency is only possible by raising prices. There is still hope that a resolution can be made before the conference adjourns on July 27, allowing gold-standard and non-gold-standard countries to get closely aligned. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Moving Troops to the Frontier and Developing the Northwest 明</h3>
<p>Sun Dianying's troops have recently been ordered to Qinghai for reclamation and cultivation. This action, while the Chahar (察哈尔) issue is unresolved, is particularly worthy of national attention. Since the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, the average soldier in this country only knew how to exploit the people and enrich themselves, disregarding national interests. After facing the serious national crisis of the September 18th Incident, a thorough awakening has occurred. For example, the Sichuan warlords have fought three internal wars in the past year and a half. The Two Liu's fought, then Liu and Deng fought, and now Yu Liu has started a conflict with Liu Wenhui. However, they are unwilling to contribute even one or two percent of their strength to the wealthy Sichuan-Kang frontier for the sake of development. It has been a long time since anyone cared about the frontier.</p>
<p>The proposal to send troops to Qinghai has been advocated many times, but it has never been implemented. Sun Dianying's troops were not originally a particularly strong army, and their understanding of modern national consciousness may not have been fully developed. However, they were actually able to accept the Central Government's orders and prepare to set off. If this comes to fruition, then in a positive light, in this period of great difficulty, being able to not fight for personal gain and instead reclaim and cultivate the frontier is truly a rare quality in troops. The meaning is that first, purely consuming troops (in reality, our troops not only consume but also harass the people) can be transformed into a central driving force for the future of national construction and become agricultural producers. Second, Qinghai is still lagging behind in the pastoral era. With this development, it will inevitably push toward an agricultural society, which will greatly benefit the provinces of Gansu and Shaanxi. Third, the northwestern border defense is already extremely strained, and the separatist tendencies of Tibet are particularly obvious. Sun's trip here also carries a major mission for national defense. If they can diligently carry out their mission, then what is lost in the east may well be recovered in the northwest.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of Qinghai, our powerful neighbor is plotting to take over our territory, and the unity of the local area is not solid. Without a strategy to appease and attract people from afar, the sudden arrival of a large army will only further provoke our powerful neighbor's further encroachment. At the same time, it will also stir up the border people's suspicion. Without effective border management, the desired results are difficult to achieve, and even the existing situation may be difficult to maintain. Moreover, Qinghai and Xinjiang are both areas where both Hui (Muslim Chinese) and Han people live, and other religions are mixed in, so the relationship between ethnicity and religion is complex and not as simple as the general state of other social economies. Therefore, political issues must be carefully and prudently resolved before reclamation can be discussed and land can be opened up in this wilderness.</p>
<p>Developing the northwest is truly the only effective way to overcome the national crisis today. However, in reality, the most developed provinces in our country, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian, have not yet fully completed their modern industrial organization. Even if there are a small number of industrial and economic organizations, they are mostly light industries, and there is no sign of the manufacture of steel and machinery, which are the true driving forces of industrial and collective agriculture. The strength for developing the frontier is particularly weak. Moreover, this kind of undertaking is by no means something that a certain part of the manpower and financial resources can undertake. The government must first have an overall plan, concentrate manpower and financial resources, and consider both national and provincial defense, and then political efficiency can be promoted. The border provinces, such as Qinghai, can then be transformed from a pastoral economy and begin to construct modern industries. If attention is not paid to this, and only Sun Dianying's army is relied upon to take on this great task, no matter how firm Sun's determination or how vigorous his actions, the result will likely be in vain.</p>

<h3>Mussolini's State Banquet; Song Ziwen Offers Italian Experience for China's Reference</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Believes Italian Success Is an Important Model</p>
<p>Rome Chinese Minister of Finance Song Ziwen will depart for Paris tomorrow. A short telegram reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini hosted a state banquet at the Fort of Fusano last night to entertain Song. Approximately eighty people attended, including key government officials such as Minister of Finance Rengier, Minister of Justice Franceschetti, Minister of Foreign Affairs Suvich, and President of the Parliament Podrecca. Mussolini delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Italian government, referring to China as the vanguard of Eastern culture and Italy as the vanguard of Western culture. The two major cultures of the East and West have long been in contact through an Italian. Given the early age of the relationship and the sincerity of the friendship between the two countries, Italy's experience of rebirth may be of value for China's reference. Song responded that the historical and cultural relationship between China and Italy is the most fortunate fact, and that Italy, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has leapt to the forefront of the international community within ten years. Internally, the country is united and striving for construction, and externally, it enjoys the respect of the world, which is an even more important model. China values your country's experience and ancient culture. If the Chinese people have the same aspirations, do not hesitate to sacrifice, and work together, they will regain the position they deserve. (15th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Recently Constructed Railway Lines</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways announced yesterday that the railways completed and under construction from 1929 to 1932 totaled 322 kilometers.

<h3>Hebei's Finances Are Extremely Depleted</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain gentleman responsible for Hebei's finances said that the province's finances have long been in dire straits. During the previous war, more than 20 counties were affected by the war, and the local area was exhausted, the tax base was depleted, and revenue decreased. In order to sympathize with the people's difficulties, the government decided to exempt all farmland taxes and miscellaneous taxes in the affected counties for a considerable period after the official handover. As a result, tax revenue will decrease by more than 3.1 million yuan in one year. Moreover, many counties are suffering from wind, locust, and flood disasters, which will also affect revenue by more than one million yuan. Calculating the previous figures, the reduction in revenue will be around 5 million yuan. The total annual expenditure of Hebei Province is 17 to 18 million yuan. The sudden reduction of such a large amount will make it impossible for the finances to maintain the status quo. Moreover, due to the sluggishness of various places, it is difficult to increase revenue, and reducing expenditure is not allowed by the facts. Remedial measures are being discussed.

<h3>Italian Air Fleet Arrives Safely in Chicago</h3>
<p>More Than 500,000 People Gather on the Lakefront to Welcome Them, 42 American Aircraft Soar Through the Sky to Greet Them</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Chicago, 15th) The Italian Air Fleet, consisting of 23 aircraft, crossed the Atlantic Ocean, completing the greatest long-distance flight as a group, and flew over the Chicago sky this afternoon, safely landing on Lake Michigan. The grandeur and orderliness of the group were exactly the same as when they departed from Lake Albano near Rome on July 1st. The Chicago World's Fair grounds, as well as the roofs and parks throughout the city along the lakefront, were crowded with spectators. At 4:23 PM, factory and ship sirens sounded in unison, and church bells echoed with the sound of firecrackers, announcing the arrival of the Italian aircraft. As a result, traffic throughout the city suddenly stopped. Even in the distant areas, cars on the road stopped so that the people inside could look up at the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Italian Air Fleet departed from Montreal at 11:40 this morning. Upon receiving the news here, 42 army aircraft were dispatched about an hour before the estimated arrival time to meet the Italian aircraft entering from Detroit and guide them to the World's Fair. After arriving, the American aircraft withdrew, leaving the 23 Italian aircraft to soar through the sky. Italian Air Minister Balbo, knowing that the residents of Chicago were crowding the streets to look up at them, ordered the aircraft to circle the city for a long time before landing. The first aircraft safely landed on the lake surface at 5:03, and the last aircraft landed at 5:40. Balbo then rushed to the telegraph office to send a telegram to Prime Minister Mussolini, reporting the safe arrival of the entire team and the enthusiastic welcome from Chicago.</p>
<p>According to Balbo, the flight from Montreal was one of the most difficult to fly over land. The sky was bad, and the wind was coming from the side, making it even more difficult to fly in formation. Today, the entire Italian community in Chicago went to the lakefront to welcome them. Factories in the city also stopped work for half a day to celebrate. The flight time for the air fleet from Berlin to Chicago was less than 100 hours.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Chicago, 15th) The Italian Air Fleet flew from Montreal to Chicago in eight hours. When they arrived on Lake Michigan, the sky was free of any clouds. The sunlight shone on the wings of the aircraft, dazzlingly bright. The lake surface was gently fanned by a breeze, creating ripples. When the aircraft arrived, they were in groups of three. General Balbo was the first to land. After exiting the aircraft, he saluted with the fascist salute. At that time, nearly a million people cheered to welcome him.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Chicago, 15th) This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Italian Air Fleet Commander General Balbo and other pilots all arrived safely here. In the morning, more than 500,000 people gathered on the shore of Lake Michigan, craning their necks to wait for the Italian aircraft. When the Italian aircraft landed, the crowd cheered to express their welcome. The Italian Air Fleet left Montreal at 11:09 this morning. This leg of the journey was 850 miles. When the Italian aircraft flew into American airspace, 40 American aircraft greeted them. The aircraft driven by General Balbo was the first to leave Montreal, carrying Italian Ambassador to the United States Rosso, who had gone to Montreal to welcome the Italian Air Fleet. The authorities issued an order that no aircraft, except those officially welcoming them, were allowed to fly within half a mile of the Italian Air Fleet, to prevent endangering the team. The weather was excellent during this flight. The route followed the St. Lawrence River, passing through Lake Ontario, Kingston, Belleville, Toronto, Hamilton, Niagara Falls, Buffalo, and then heading straight to Chicago.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Chicago, 15th) The Italian Air Fleet flew 6,615 miles from Albano to Chicago, for a total flight time of 47 and a half hours. After bathing and changing clothes, the air fleet assembled at the military field, where more than 100,000 spectators participated in the official welcome from the Governor of Illinois and the Mayor of Chicago. (Reuters, Rome, 15th) The Italian people are deeply delighted by the Italian Air Fleet's completion of its flight to the Chicago World's Fair. In particular, the Pope was the first to inquire about the arrival of the Italian Air Fleet. Since the Italian Air Fleet took off, the Pope has been very concerned about their journey, with a large map hanging on the wall. All the places the Italian Air Fleet has already flown over are marked with small flags for identification. This map is the same as the one in the library of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The Pope telegraphed the Bishop of Chicago to bless General Balbo on his behalf and convey the Pope's good intentions.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Rome, 15th) People from all walks of life in Rome strolled the streets or gathered in cafes to await the news of General Balbo and his team arriving at the Chicago World's Fair. When the news arrived, people from all walks of life cheered excitedly or made strange noises, and lit torches to parade in celebration, which lasted for several hours. Other cities in Italy also had similar celebrations.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Decides to Continue Non-Violent Resistance from August 1st</h3>
<p>The Indian Governor-General Cannot Accept Gandhi's Conditions</p>
<p>(Reuters, Pune, 15th) According to reliable sources, Indian Governor-General Willingdon may not agree to the conditions proposed by Gandhi. Gandhi recently asked the National Congress to re-appoint him as dictator and allow him to have full power to contact the Governor-General to resolve the issue. The National Congress then decided by a majority vote that if a solution is reached, non-violent resistance will be canceled. However, Gandhi used his skillful tactics to overturn the majority decision and will resume individual non-violent resistance from August 1st. Although this move is not what most people want, there are certainly those who support it. The Indian government will take appropriate measures when non-violent resistance resumes.</p>

<h3>The Opening of the World Economic Conference (Berlin Correspondence) Public Security</h3>
<p>(1) The Grand Opening and the British Emperor's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>The World Economic Conference, as grand as the Versailles Peace Conference in those years, opened yesterday (Monday, June 12) at 3:00 PM in the Geological Museum in London, the capital of the British Empire. The solemnity and splendor of the venue set a new record unprecedented in world conferences. Sixty-six countries attended the meeting, including strong and weak, large and small countries and nations from all over the world. The total number of official representatives from various countries was 168, and the number of secretaries in the delegations was approximately 400. Experts attending, such as diplomats, politicians, economists, and financiers, numbered as many as 200. Five hundred journalists from various countries attended to observe the proceedings. In addition, there were various special attendees, totaling no fewer than 2,000 participants. British Prime Minister MacDonald served as the chairman of the conference, and the British Emperor personally attended to deliver his sincere opening congratulatory speech, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, at a time when the general economy is limited to the deepest decline, I greet you here with the deepest sense of responsibility. I believe that since the history of the world, it is the first time for a monarch to deliver a congratulatory speech at the opening of a world conference. I wish that such a conference will be able to fulfill my intentions and live up to my expectations, and be able to create good results. I also especially greet the representatives of the member states of the League of Nations. I always pay attention to and value the work of the League of Nations with the deepest meaning and treasure. This conference was convened under the responsibility of the League of Nations, and the outline of this conference was also contributed by the expert committee of the League of Nations after very in-depth research.</p>
<p>Without the League of Nations and the ideals of the League of Nations, could such a great world conference be held? I have great doubts. I also extend the same sincere greetings to the representatives of non-League of Nations member states who have come to participate in the World Economic Conference. I acknowledge that mankind has the courage and spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance, which makes your representatives of non-League of Nations member states also enthusiastically participate in this World Economic Conference today. Secondly, I would also like to extend special greetings to the representatives from my British Empire territories and India.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have infinite feelings and great tension when I see this representative conference composed of the entire world's domain. This conference represents the hopes and prayers of the world. The world is currently in a state of unease. From today onwards, it is up to you representatives to find ways to restore the world to a stable and normal state. This mission is of course difficult. You can only complete your mission with goodwill and the most serious cooperation.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I extend my hand to you and hope with all my heart that your efforts and contributions will lead to the realization and success of the happy events that the various peoples of the entire world wish to achieve and can no longer tolerate. Although I have fully recognized the great mission of this conference, there is still a real symbolic wish that this conference will be of one mind and one will. All countries are now suffering from the same major disease, which is the daily increase in the number of unemployed workers. I have been concerned about and considered the meaning of the number of unemployed people and the pain it causes to humanity at all times in recent years. This concern is shared by all representatives who bear government responsibility.</p>
<p>In order to deal with the commonly recognized panic and danger in the world, I want to loudly call on the world to work together to seek the greatest peace in the world from now on. Removing the power of the human world cannot remedy the obstacles to material progress. Therefore, in order to restore the stability of the world from now on, we must start from our common strength. Conversely, modern inventions and the discovery of the New World, and the possible organization of production beyond needs, have created countless new difficult problems. Moreover, these amazing material advances have made countries have interdependent subordinate influences with each other. At the same time, it also forms the necessity of cooperation between nations and a new understanding. Now the time has come, and this new consciousness of the common interests of mankind can be used to the greatest extent, but it must be based on a creed, that is, both parties express the first step for proper consultations to reach this conference.</p>
<p>I am very willing to have detailed discussions and exchange opinions with you representatives, but my most urgent hope is that the results of your work will restore the world to stability and prosperity, and follow the proper and normal path forward."</p>
<p>Following the British Emperor's congratulatory speech, there was the opening remarks of the conference chairman, British Prime Minister MacDonald. The gist of his opening remarks was, "The mission of this conference is very important and great. We need this conference to have the authority to speak independently to the world as never before. In recent years, the tragic decline of world commerce has been unseen in history. We must not allow this depression and the disease that endangers the lives of all mankind to continue. We must also treat the war debt issue as the most important issue at this conference and discuss it through consultation, and we must break down all obstacles to seek its final solution. The provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne on war debts are a theoretical result. We must not break it down no matter what, but we should and must strive to perfect it. In recent years, a so-called national self-sufficiency economic policy has been popular in the world. He believes that such an economic policy is not only useless to the world, but in fact will only make mankind poor. He believes that the sooner the world can become an economic unit, the more beneficial it will be to all countries in the world. But in short, he believes that international cooperation is the only way to prosperity for all countries. He expressed his great gratitude to the expert committee that drafted the conference and. He said that the most important thing in the obligations discussed at this conference is to seek the responsibility of the governments of the representative countries and to adopt a consistent and common action problem. Among them, it is especially important for governments to solve the industrial policies of various countries and the world industrial policy. He believes that whether the world has a turning point and the possibility of improving international relations in the future depends entirely on the actions of this conference. He firmly believes that all the representatives attending the meeting have a sincere enthusiasm and effort to seek to solve the world's problems, so he wishes in advance that this conference will achieve good results that are commonly expected by the world's people," and so on. The word length is tens of thousands, which is hearty, vivid and tragic. The venue is equipped with a radio, and its wave force can reach the whole world. The entire earth's 2 billion people can receive MacDonald's speech. Is it just MacDonald's personal honor, or is it also the new gospel of the world? The speeches are translated simultaneously in English and French.</p>
<p>(2) The Origin and Purpose of Calling the Conference</p>
<p>This World Economic Conference was based on the resolution of the Lausanne War Debt Conference last year. From the generation of the resolution to the present, it has been almost a year. The progress of the conference affairs is handled by the League of Nations. Since accepting this task, the League of Nations has an expert economic committee organization. Its mission is to prepare for the World Economic Conference on the one hand, and to study the outline of the conference on the other hand. As a result, the following six issues are determined to be the main guidelines of the World Economic Conference, including (1) the issue of price stability, (2) the issue of tariff truce, (3) the issue of currency stability, (4) the issue of international trade, (5) the issue of dredging foreign exchange, (6) the issue of improving production. Seeking to solve these six issues is the main purpose of the World Economic Conference. The six discussion outlines designated by the League of Nations Expert Committee, from the appearance of the words, seem to be simple matters, but in fact they are not. The reason why the world has fallen into an extraordinary economic panic in recent years, and the many international political conflicts and diplomatic chaos caused by this panic, as well as many other social disturbances, are all caused by the failure to solve the six issues listed above. The conference address was originally set in Washington, the capital of the United States. Later, for the convenience of the majority of European countries to attend the meeting, it was finally changed to London. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Dolen Recovers, Japan Issues Warnings</h3>
<p>Tense Situation in Chahar Shows a Tendency to Ease, Li Qi Has Been Ordered to Go to Zhangyuan Again to Negotiate Xu Yongchang Denies Yan's Mediation in Chahar Affairs Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since Feng Yuxiang took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, he has been reorganizing troops such as Liu Guitang's, and organizing the Anti-Japanese Army, and plans to recover the lost land. Since Kangbao and Baochang have been recovered, Liu Guitang's troops have been ordered to concentrate in Guyuan, and Ji Hongchang, Deng Wen, and Li Zhongyi's troops have been concentrated in Zhangbei, Kangbao, and Baochang respectively. On the 7th, Ji, Li, and Liu's troops were ordered to advance on Dolen. The rebel army stationed in Dolen, Cui Xingwu's troops and Li Shouchong's brigade, numbered about 4,000. They immediately resisted stubbornly, and fierce battles broke out. Feng's troops advanced bravely and recovered Dolen at 10:00 AM on the 12th. The rebel army retreated towards the border of Rehe. Ji Hongchang's troops have now entered Dolen. In order to defend Chahar Province, they have not advanced. After the recovery of Dolen, Feng telegraphed to Beiping to report. At that time, Beiping generally believed that there was another function, and they were half doubtful. Yesterday, Feng had another telegram to Beiping reporting the process, the original text of which is omitted.</p>
<p>From all aspects of the investigation, the recovery of Dolen seems to be a fact. Today (15th), a group of wounded officers and soldiers arrived in Beiping from Zhangyuan and were sent to Xiehe Hospital for treatment. The Japanese side has paid extraordinary attention to Feng's troops recovering Dolen and has increased troops on the border of Rehe, preparing for a large-scale invasion of Chahar. The puppet state has also transferred puppet troops to that place, preparing to counterattack. As for Shibayama, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, he also received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday and went to Jurentang at 3:00 PM with Counselor Harada to see He Yingqin. He issued an oral warning regarding Feng's troops recovering Dolen, pointing out that it violated the ceasefire agreement and asked him to pay attention. After He explained, he withdrew. After the recovery of Dolen, Feng Yuxiang believed that his proposal had been implemented. He telegraphed his representatives in Beiping, Ming Zhexian and Li Qi, that since Dolen had been recovered, his goal of preserving Chahar Province and recovering the lost land had been achieved, and the aftermath of the Chahar affairs could be resolved without problems. As a result, the tense situation in Chahar suddenly revealed an opportunity for peace. Yesterday, He Yingqin specially summoned Deng and Li to talk and asked them to return to Zhangyuan to solicit Feng's opinions. Today, the Central Committee also sent a telegram to Beiping with instructions. He summoned Song Zheyuan to Jurentang to discuss the method of resolving the Chahar affairs. Li Qi has already returned to Zhang with a mission this afternoon and is scheduled to return to Beiping on the 17th. As for the rumors that Yan Xishan will mediate, Xu Yongchang strongly denied it today, saying that he personally did not receive a telegram from Yan. He also said that he had not heard of Yan asking the Central Committee to give Feng a title. However, he said that all parties in Chahar advocate a peaceful solution. Feng also has the same mentality. The Central Committee has repeatedly expressed that it will not use force. Since both sides have inclined towards peace, if a third party mediates, it will not be difficult to solve. (July 15th)</p>
<h3>Increase in Japan's Population</h3>
<p>On average, 249 people are born every hour, and 134 people die every hour, resulting in a net increase of 115 people per hour. According to the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo on the 11th, the Cabinet Statistics Bureau investigated the approximate number of births and deaths of the native population between October and December of Showa 7 (1932), and announced the following on the 10th: (1) There were 522,228 births, an increase of 55,998 compared to the 466,230 in the same period of the previous year. The total number of births in Showa 7 reached 2,182,743, with an average of 249 births per hour, an increase of 80,737 compared to the 2,102,006 in the previous year. The birth rate per 1,000 people was 32.92, also higher than the previous year. (2) There were 273,376 deaths, a decrease of 11,259 compared to the 284,635 in the same period of the previous year. The death rate for the entire year of Showa 7 was 1,174,875, with an average of 134 deaths per hour, a decrease of 65,597 compared to the 324,472 in the previous year. This low death rate is unprecedented except for the early years of the Meiji era. The natural increase in population, from births to deaths, showed an increase of 248,852 people, a sudden increase to 1,007,868 people compared to the same period last year. This astonishing phenomenon is due to the decrease in the death rate on one hand and the sharp increase in the birth rate on the other.</p>
<h3>Recent Progress of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army</h3>
<p>Building defensive works near Xunwu, opening an airfield, the Fourth Division advancing to Anyuan, the First Army taking over defense of Xinfeng. According to Guangzhou communications, since the First and Second Detachments of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army advanced on separate routes, the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Second Detachment are currently building defensive works near Xunwu. The Eighth Division has assigned Xie Zheng's regiment to build fortresses and dig trenches at Sanbiao Xu. The artillery fort near the city is being built by Chen Fengzhao's regiment. The trenches along the Liuche line are being urgently excavated by the 22nd and 23rd Regiments and the engineers. In addition, an airfield is being opened outside Xunwu City to facilitate the take-off and landing of bandit suppression aircraft at any time. The Fifth Air Squadron is expected to depart from the province for Dongjiang within a day or two, preparing to advance to the front to assist in suppressing the communist bandits. Furthermore, road construction is also actively underway in southern Jiangxi. The various units of the First Army have begun to work separately. Recently, central approval has been obtained for monthly remittances of 50,000 yuan for road construction in southern Jiangxi by the First Army. The First Army's anti-communist military operations are also proceeding vigorously. According to a report on the 10th of this month, bandit traces were suddenly discovered near Chongyi in the southwest corner of Jiangxi. The First Division Commander Li Zhenqiu dispatched a team to suppress them. A telegram yesterday stated that over 800 remnants of bandits from Dahu Jiang, five li from Chongyi, across the river, were harassing the Jiahe area of the ninth district of Gan County, attempting to actively kill farmers. On the 7th, Chen Kehua's regiment was dispatched to cross the river and attack within five days. The bandits resisted from the mountains, but fortunately, our artillery and machine gun companies fought bravely and charged into the battle. The bandits could not withstand the attack and began to flee towards Hualin Temple. In this battle, over 200 bandits were killed, and dozens of weapons were seized. Over 20 male and female bandits surrendered. Our casualties were few. As for Xinfeng, after the Fourth Division of the Second Army recovered Chongshi Xu and Shiban Xu, Division Commander Zhang Meixin immediately led Jiang Wu's regiment from Shiban Xu and arrived at Anyuan City on the 7th of this month. The remaining 11th and 12th Regiments also continued to advance. Currently, the Fourth Division Headquarters is located in Anyuan County, and Jiang's regiment has been assigned to install military telephones to establish contact with the Seventh and Eighth Divisions in Xunwu. After the Fourth Division departed from Xinfeng, the defense of Xinfeng left behind was taken over by Deng Qichang and Ye Guangchang's regiments of the Second Division of the First Army, which arrived on the 9th of this month to take over the defense.

<h3>The Haiqi and Other Three Warships Formally Incorporated by the Southwest</h3>
<p>Guangdong first allocates funds for assistance, and both parties have reached an agreement. On the 10th, the three warships sailed into Huangpu, and Guangdong sent personnel for inspection. According to Guangzhou communications, the Haiqi, Zhaohai, and Haichen three warships of the Bohai Fleet, after arriving at Chiwan in Guangdong, immediately anchored there. The captains of the three warships personally went to Guangdong to pay respects to the Guangdong military and civilian authorities and to discuss the issue of joining the south. Initially, the authorities were still considering this matter, but after several discussions, they decided to incorporate them. After negotiating various conditions with the three captains, Guangdong first provided food and salaries to allow the three warships to sail into the waters inside Humen to await incorporation. After the three warships sailed into Huangpu and formally joined, although the officers and soldiers on board would not be changed, Guangdong would send three deputy captains to assist the original three captains in reorganizing the ship's affairs and to issue a telegram expressing their allegiance to the Southwest government. On the morning of the 8th, the three captains returned to their ships and reported to all the officers and soldiers the process of their trip to Guangdong. At the same time, the Guangdong Naval Headquarters also sent Deputy Commander Li Qingwen, Staff Officer Chen Zuda, Fuan warship captain Fang Nianzu, and Haihu warship captain Ding Jian San, to Chiwan on the Haihu warship at 9 a.m. on the 8th to convey the Guangdong's intentions to the officers and soldiers of the three warships. The officers and soldiers of the three warships all expressed their sincere support for the Southwest. On the 9th, the First Army Group was ordered to allocate 15,000 yuan for the temporary maintenance of food for the three warships, 5,000 yuan per ship. After receiving the first allocation of funds, the three captains immediately held a joint meeting and decided on the following three principles: (1) The regular expenses of the three warships should be economized and a budget should be prepared and submitted to the Guangdong authorities for approval. (2) The captains of the three warships should jointly send a telegram announcing their separation from Shen Honglie and expressing their willingness to serve the Southwest government and participate in the work of resisting Japan and suppressing communism. (3) The three warships should be under the command and control of the First Army Group and cooperate with the Guangdong Navy to the end. The Southwest Political Council held a meeting on the 9th regarding this matter and decided to transfer this case to the First Army Group Headquarters for handling. On the 10th, the captains of the three warships, with the consent of Guangdong Province, decided to weigh anchor at 10 a.m. on the 10th from Chiwan, guided by the Haihu warship sent by Guangdong, and sailed towards Humen and the inner river. The Guangdong authorities notified the Humen fortresses in advance to allow them to pass. At about 11 a.m. on the 10th, the Haiqi and other three warships passed through the Weiyuan Fortress and headed towards the Huangpu port. At about 3 p.m., the three warships successively arrived at the Huangpu river surface.

<h3>Collapse of Dikes in Wuhu</h3>
<p>The county magistrate personally supervises the workers to rescue the dikes. The counties of Fanchang and Tongling are also in danger. According to Wuhu communications, Anhui Province suffered greatly from the floods of the previous year. The rural economy has long been bankrupt. They fully hoped for a bumper harvest this year to make up for the losses. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of summer, it has been raining continuously, and the water level has risen sharply. The dikes in various counties are all in imminent danger. Fortunately, it has not rained for a long time, otherwise, the situation would be unimaginable. Although the weather has cleared up now, the water level is receding very slowly. The water level in the upper reaches is high, and the river tides are turbulent. The Ma Hua Dike, which connects Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, has breached dozens of feet. The surrounding dikes are all in extreme danger. Farmers are rescuing them day and night. Liu Yiyan, director of the Construction Department, urgently telegraphed Lou Daoxin, director of the Wuhu Public Works Bureau, to purchase 20,000 hemp bags and transport them to the province for use because of the lack of rescue materials. Liu Zhenhua, chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, noted that the Yangtze River Flood Control Committee had already been established in Xun. The province was divided into the third flood control zone, divided into fifteen sections, and the magistrates of the counties along the river were appointed as flood control commissioners. After Wang Zhuren, the magistrate of Wuhu County, was appointed, he took office to contact the section engineers sent by the committee at any time to handle flood control matters. Shanrui Shangwei Majiatan in the county suddenly collapsed four zhang a few days ago, and the lower Wei Temple Ji'an also collapsed two zhang. Xinzhuang An collapsed five zhang. Zhusi Port Tongcheng An's Dumen all reported seepage. Xiwu Wei Yangba An collapsed in four places one after another, about thirty zhang long. The situation is extremely critical. Magistrate Wang went to inspect it this morning (14th) and ordered the workers to rescue the dikes, and ordered Yang Kui, the dike patrolman, to lead the responsible personnel of the Wei to repair them carefully to avoid the danger of collapsing. According to the report from Gao Xuezhong, the Jianghe Dike Committee member of various counties sent by the Second District Commissioner's Office, the Jianghe dikes in Fanchang and Tongling counties, except for those that have already collapsed, are all one chi to six or seven chi under water. In Tongling County, six dikes have collapsed, flooding thousands of mu of fields, resulting in considerable losses. (July 14)</p>
<h3>Investigation Begins on the Case of the Gold Cellar Theft at Kong Geng's Residence in Wuchang</h3>
<p>At the first investigation meeting, Kong and Peng engaged in heated debate. The gold-digging workers described the discovery on the spot. According to Hankou communications, the case of the gold cellar theft at Kong Geng's residence in Wuchang has been widely reported in society. After Kong reported the matter to the authorities, the Garrison Department organized an investigation committee to conduct the investigation. Peng Younan, the main culprit in the case, once fled to Shanghai and has now returned to Hankou. He still does not admit to obtaining the large amount of gold and silver. The Cellar Gold Investigation Committee was established the day before yesterday and convened its first investigation meeting on the 15th to begin work. The meeting was held in the Wuchang Chamber of Commerce. All the members of the investigation committee, Yan Guyin, representative of the Military Law Office of the Garrison Department, Chen Bangben and Xu Chongren, representatives of the Lawyers Association, Xie Yanhua, representative of the County Government, Guo Maolian, representative of the Public Security Bureau, Yu Jusun, representative of the Chamber of Commerce, Xia Ziwen and Yao Zuqing, representatives of the Owners Association, Yang Xiyu, representative of the Yarn Industry Association, the accuser Kong Geng, Kong Yansheng, the defendants Peng Younan and Peng Shisun, and the witnesses Sun Fenghao, Zheng Wenqing, Tao Shaolian, and Wei Chunting all attended. Yu Jusun, the chairman, reported on the establishment of the committee and its tasks, and decided to handle the case with impartiality. After Yu's report, Kong Geng, Peng Younan, and Peng Shisun successively described the circumstances of the case, engaging in heated debate for a long time. Although Peng did not admit to obtaining a large amount of gold, he could not provide a convincing answer to the responsibility for trespassing and stealing. Subsequently, Sun Fenghao, one of the witnesses, stated that he was the mediator after the case occurred. At that time, Kong did propose the condition that all acknowledged items would be confiscated and that unacknowledged items would be investigated. However, Peng did not agree, and he withdrew from the mediation. Zheng Wenqing stated that he was the escort of the cellar silver and had escorted silver for Peng across the river to Hankou and deposited it in the bank. Tao Shaolian stated that he was a mud worker. On the morning of May 30, the worker Li Changhe discovered the gold cellar and reported it to the foreman, who informed Peng Younan. Peng then stopped further digging and saw three boxes being transported out. Peng promised Yu and Li 20 yuan each and temporarily stopped work. When they went to Peng's residence again in the afternoon, they saw Peng's family digging with hoes and prohibited all workers from approaching. When the Fourth Branch of the Police Bureau summoned Yu and Li for questioning, they both provided truthful statements. Later, Peng summoned Yu and Li and instructed them to submit a statement to the authorities, completely reversing their previous statements. Yu refused, and Peng negotiated with Li alone, the details of which are unknown. Another witness, Wei Chunting, was also one of the accusers. According to his statement, it was even more thorough and detailed, and it was the most important reference material for the case. Wei stated that his mother used to teach the women of the Liu Changmao family (the former owner of the house where the gold was hidden, now Kong Geng's villa) to read and had personally seen the excavation of a cellar with more than 500 gold ingots, countless gold leaves and gold bars, and more than 1,000 large and small silver ingots, worth hundreds of thousands. Based on this, the situation should be the same. On May 30, a worker whom he knew well told him about Peng's gold digging. Considering the serious national crisis, he thought that this ownerless treasure could be donated to purchase airplanes, so he sneaked into Peng's residence with the worker to investigate. He personally saw three boxes being transported out first and four boxes being transported out later. He immediately went to the Fourth Branch of the Police Bureau to report the matter. That night, he led the officers sent by the bureau to Peng's residence to inspect the location of the cellar. After the inspection, the bureau said that it would be handled the next day and then said that it had been forwarded to the General Bureau for handling, so there was no further investigation. This matter was never known to the outside world. Recently, the Police Department reviewed the files of the Fourth Bureau and discovered this matter, and Wei became an important witness. The Investigation Committee considered that the first meeting was a preliminary work and that more evidence needed to be collected. After discussion, it was decided that all the committee members would personally go to the cellar site for an on-site inspection on the 16th, and the second investigation meeting would be held on the 17th to summarize the facts and opinions and report them to the Police Department for review.

<h3>Locust Plague Rises in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>The crops in Gaoyuan County have been eaten up. According to Jinan communications, the wheat harvest in this province this spring was quite good, about 80% of a bumper year. Now the autumn crops are growing, but locust nymphs are rising everywhere. In the southwest of this city, locust nymphs have damaged the seedlings, and the situation is spreading. They have also been discovered in Rongcheng in eastern Shandong, Qiuxian in western Shandong, and Gaoyuan and Qingcheng in northern Shandong. The Department of Civil Affairs has ordered all counties to intensify the efforts to catch them in order to prevent a disaster. The reports from various counties are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Baoli, the magistrate of Rongcheng County, reported to the Department of Civil Affairs that locust nymphs were discovered in the eastern part of Zhaizi in the east of the county. He immediately dispatched political police to the area to supervise the people in thoroughly surrounding and catching them, and they have now been eliminated.</p>
<p>Yu Youlin, the magistrate of Qiuxian County, reported to the Department of Civil Affairs that locust nymphs suddenly appeared in Chencun and other villages in the county. The seedlings were damaged and have already been completely caught. After receiving the report, the Department of Civil Affairs immediately instructed the people to be vigilant at all times to prevent the crops from being damaged and affecting the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>Locusts were discovered in Yongjiafang in the fourth district of Gaoyuan County. They flew from the northeast, about six or seven li wide. When they rose, they covered the sky; when they fell, they covered the ground. A handful was full, and a kick was full of legs. They could not be driven away, and they could not be beaten. The crops have been eaten up, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Farmers are frowning, and it is not known where the young locusts that will be born in the future will end up. According to the report from Liu Huating, the magistrate of Qingcheng County, locusts suddenly flew to the Lijiazhuang area in the northeast of the first district of the county on the 8th. Fortunately, they all flew to the northwest the next morning, and the crops were unharmed.</p>

<h3>The Luoshe Town Strike Resumes Business</h3>
<p>Lu Chenggong, an inspector of the Public Security Bureau of this county, led a large number of police officers to Luoshe Town in the 16th district this month to catch gamblers. However, they were accused of indiscriminately arresting innocent people, beating rural women, entering houses and destroying property, and behaving like bandits, which aroused public anger in the town. The entire town went on strike, and representatives such as Zhang Bao San and Liu Bangyan were sent to the city to petition the party and government agencies, demanding the removal and punishment of the police officers involved, compensation for losses, and protection of the safety of merchants and residents. The county government sent section member Zhou Shaoji to the countryside to investigate the truth of the incident together with District Chief Bao. Yesterday (16th) morning, the shops in the town, after persuasion from District Chief Bao and Committee Member Pu of the County Party Department, have all resumed business. However, their attitude remains firm. If the party and government do not provide a satisfactory solution, they have decided to send six representatives to the Second District Administrative Inspector's Office today (17th) to petition, and they will not stop until they achieve their goal. Fang Chen, the old woman who was pushed down and suffocated, has been sent to the city by boat yesterday to be treated at the Brothers Hospital. She is in a coma and still in danger of death. Qian Rendi, the young man who was beaten and vomited blood, has slightly recovered from his injuries. At the same time, the villagers jointly telegraphed the province, requesting relief and fair handling of the matter.</p>

<h3>An Old Virgin Donates Property to Establish a School</h3>
<p>In this city, there are two sisters, Zhang Xiuzhen and Zhang Xiuzhu, who are committed to celibacy. The elder sister is sixty-seven years old, and the younger sister is over sixty years old. Their family is well-off, but there is no one to inherit their property. Recently, Xiuzhen became ill and, fearing that she would not recover due to her old age, she petitioned the court to allow her to donate 30 dan of the 70 dan of land she had accumulated for education, after leaving 10 dan for her funeral expenses. The remaining 30 dan would be left for her younger sister Xiuzhu to live on. If her younger sister died, 10 dan would also be used for funeral expenses, and the remainder would still be donated to education. After receiving the petition, President Xu of the court sent a judge, a clerk, and several bailiffs to the woman's residence to inquire about the details of her petition.

<h3>Crew and Passengers of the Tunam Ship Rescued, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Maru brought 65 people</p>
<p>Number of people drowned: 117</p>
<p>The crew and passengers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunam ship, which sank after being hit by the Japanese ship "Choshun Maru", arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the "Tianjin Maru". Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Zhu Yaoting, director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, and Gao Tingzi, director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, were all present at the wharf to take care of them. A total of 54 crew members and 11 passengers arrived yesterday. The details of the disaster as described by the reporter and shipowner Jiang Changqing at the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Sending Personnel to Take Care of Them</h3>
<p>The Dalian Steamship Company's "Tianjin Maru" sailed into the Huangpu Wharf at about 7 a.m. yesterday morning. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent the following personnel to the wharf to receive and take care of the survivors: General Manager Liu Hongsheng, Director and Deputy Director of the Shipping Department Zhao Yuntai and Zhou Houkun, reception staff Qian Shuming, Huang Xuchu, Zhu Zhilin, Shi Weijun, and Xu Songyue. The Junan Association sent manager Ding Kangrong, General Affairs Director Li Zaichen, Director of the Fireman and Seaman Department Li Ruigen, secretary Gu Rongchuang, Xu Shenqing, and Business Director Xu Yougeng, and twenty more people. Zhu Yaoting, director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, Gao Tingzi, director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, and other officials also went to the wharf to inspect everything.</p>
<h3>Cries at the Wharf</h3>
<p>The family members and relatives of the sailors, stokers, and mid-cabin passengers of the ship *Tu Nan*, as well as other passengers, upon hearing that the survivors were arriving in Shanghai, came to the Huangpu Wharf at dawn to wait. By the time the *Tianjin Maru* arrived and docked at the wharf, it was already eight o'clock. Ordinary passengers and those picking up guests were initially prohibited from entering by the police. Instead, the sixty-five rescued crew members and passengers of the *Tu Nan* were allowed to disembark first. Among them was the sailor Zhou Zhicheng, whose foot had been crushed during the escape, and had to be carried ashore. Ten people from the stoker department, including Ying Bingsheng; fourteen from the sailor department, including Zhang Xiaojin; two from the purser department; six crew members; twenty-two from the mid-cabin department; and eleven passengers went ashore. Their families were overjoyed to see them alive. Those whose family members had not returned knew that all hope was lost and began to wail loudly at the wharf. At that moment, the cries were heart-wrenching, and even those who came to welcome others were moved to tears.</p>
<h3>Consoling the Crew</h3>
<p>After the crew members disembarked, apart from the ship owner Jiang Changqing and the first and second mates, who were picked up by cars sent by General Manager Liu Hongsheng to their homes to inquire about the cause of the *Tu Nan*'s sinking, Gao Tingzi, Zhao Yuntai, and others accompanied them. The twenty-six stokers and sailors were taken to the Jun'an Association in four trucks. Each was given cigarettes, handkerchiefs, fans, and other items, and Li Ruigen registered them one by one. At half-past nine, a group photo was taken to commemorate the occasion. At ten-fourteen, Liu Hongsheng, accompanied by Gao Tingzi, also went to the Jun'an Association to personally console the sailors. Liu personally gave each person sixty yuan as temporary expenses. At half-past ten, everyone went home. The thirty-two laborers from the mid-cabin department were taken to the Asia Hotel by Shen Yougeng, the business director. This morning, everyone still has to go to the association to discuss the aftermath. Regarding the compensation for the deceased crew members, the Jun'an Association will follow the previous practice of requesting the bureau to provide 500 yuan per person, which will be deposited in the bank. It will be paid out when the death is definitively proven.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Aftermath</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, at his residence yesterday morning, with Director Gao of the Shipping Bureau, the chief and deputy directors of the shipping section, and six senior crew members including the rescued captain Jiang Changqing, after listening to the report from Jiang and others, discussed the aftermath of the case and the procedures for negotiations with the Japanese side. They dispersed at half-past twelve. Captain Jiang and others then went to the Driving Association for lunch, and the reporter was also present. Captain Jiang said that the *Tu Nan*'s sinking this time, its speed and tragedy, was unprecedented. It broke into two sections and sank immediately after the collision. The ship disappeared into the sea in three or four minutes. Not only was there no time for rescue efforts, but there was also no time to escape. It was truly a rare major tragedy in the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>The Circumstances of the Collision</h3>
<p>According to the shipowner of *Tu Nan*, Jiang Changqing, and the first mate, Sun Zuoren, told the reporter that the *Tu Nan* passed through the most dangerous and difficult-to-navigate Chengsan Cape bay in Shandong at one thirty in the morning on the tenth of this month. There was fog on the sea surface, but no accidents occurred on the ship. The fog subsided slightly later. At around three o'clock, the fog became heavy again. At three forty, the ship arrived outside the Shidao Island of Shandong Peninsula, about sixteen nautical miles away. The *Tu Nan* was traveling slowly and cautiously, following the nautical regulations, at a very low speed, and sounded the foghorn. It also heard the foghorn of another ship. At three fifty, when the two ships were within two characters' distance of the *Tu Nan*'s bow, the shipowner of the *Tu Nan* immediately ordered a reverse course to let the *Changchun Maru* pass. However, the Japanese ship came like a flying horse. The *Tu Nan*'s whistle had just been pulled when the red light of the Japanese ship was seen. The bow of the *Changchun Maru* suddenly crashed into the second cabin of the *Tu Nan*'s starboard side. There was a loud crash, and the *Tu Nan* was cut into two sections by the Japanese ship, starting from the captain's cabin. It sank immediately. According to Jiang and Sun, there had never been a collision as quick and as devastating to split a ship into two. The tragedy was beyond description.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Disaster</h3>
<p>There were over two hundred crew members and passengers on board. At the time of the collision, most of the passengers were already asleep, and the sailors and mid-cabin crew members were also resting. When the ship was split into two, Jiang Changqing fell from the captain's cabin and was pressed under it. The first mate, Sun Zuoren, and the sailors and stokers on the deck numbered about twenty. After the *Tu Nan* was broken, the section from the bow to the second cabin sank into the sea, disappearing in just three minutes. When the bow section sank into the sea, it was rolled by the waves, and the bottom of the ship faced the sky for a moment. The stern half of the *Tu Nan*, from the third cabin to the stern, stood upright towards the sky. At this time, the *Changchun Maru* was still moving forward and did not stop. Only when turning the ship, the Japanese ship and the *Tu Nan* were in a parallel line. Shipowner Jiang Changqing and the first and second mates, disregarding their lives, leaped towards the Japanese ship. Jiang grabbed the porthole of the *Changchun Maru* with both hands. The first and second mates and nineteen stokers and sailors jumped onto the *Changchun Maru*. Some fell on the deck, and some grabbed the door frame, so no one was uninjured. Eight passengers on the upper deck also bravely jumped into the Japanese ship after the collision. Everyone on the *Changchun Maru* looked back at the *Tu Nan*, which had already sunk. The collision had happened just four or five minutes earlier.</p>
<h3>Supervision of the Rescue</h3>
<p>The crew and passengers who could not escape from the cabins and those in the bedrooms watched as the ship sank. At this time, the *Changchun Maru* did not stop. However, at the request of Jiang Changqing and others, it launched lifeboats to rescue the survivors. The Japanese then ordered the *Changchun Maru* to stop and launched many lifeboats. Under the supervision of Jiang and others, they sailed to assist in the rescue. At that time, the sea was full of scattered fruit from the ship's baskets, oil from broken barrels, and salted fish. By the time the lifeboats reached the Shidao waters, there was no trace of the *Tu Nan*. Many crew members and passengers were clinging to wooden planks and other objects, drifting in the waves. They were gradually picked up by the lifeboats and sent to the *Changchun Maru*. Everyone rescued from the sea was naked. Those who fell into the water from the bedrooms were injured, struck by wooden planks and debris swept by the waves in the sea. One person from the cargo department died shortly after being rescued due to severe injuries. The body has been collected in Dalian for burial.</p>
<h3>Number of Deaths</h3>
<p>The reporter further asked Captain Jiang about the exact number of crew and passengers lost. According to Captain Jiang, out of the crew members, fifty-four were rescued and one died. Four stokers, nine sailors, six pursers, and thirty-two mid-cabin crew members died. Regarding the passengers, according to the purser's report, there were one hundred and one ticketed passengers who could be verified, and thirty-six were rescued, so sixty-five drowned. As for the number of passengers who did not buy tickets but were privately brought on board by the stewards (i.e., passengers who did not buy tickets, a type of business for the stewards called "bringing yellow croakers"), there is no way to know now that most of the stewards have died. According to reports, the total number of deaths is one hundred and seventeen. The *Changchun Maru* rescued a total of ninety people to Dalian, including fifty-four crew members and thirty-six passengers.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Sign</h3>
<p>When the *Changchun Maru* was carrying these ninety rescued crew and passengers to Dalian, the shipowner suddenly drafted a report on the collision between the two ships on behalf of Jiang Changqing. One part was for the *Changchun Maru*'s report, and the other was for the *Tu Nan*'s report. The report was written in Japanese. After drafting, the *Changchun Maru*'s shipowner ordered Jiang Changqing to sign it, intending to submit it to the Dalian Customs, the Maritime Court, and the Dalian Steamship Company. Captain Jiang believed that this matter was of great importance. How could a report be drafted unilaterally by the Japanese? He immediately refused to sign, saying that he did not know Japanese and did not know what was written in the report, so he could not sign it rashly. The Japanese repeatedly requested, but Jiang absolutely refused. As a result, it was not signed. After arriving in Dalian at ten o'clock in the morning on the eleventh, the Dalian branch of the China Merchants Bureau found a small inn for these ninety people to live in. Everyone was not fully clothed when they were rescued. Passengers and sailors were even naked. Jiang then negotiated with the branch to borrow money. Six hundred yuan was raised on the twelfth. Jiang then distributed thirty yuan to each senior crew member, five yuan to each stoker and sailor, and three yuan to each passenger to buy clothes and shoes. At the same time, he telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau to remit three thousand yuan to Dalian to purchase tickets back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Passengers Scattered</h3>
<p>After the thirty-six rescued passengers arrived in Dalian, many did not want to go to Shanghai and were given money to leave in Dalian. Twenty-one went from Dalian to Niuzhuang, one went to Yantai, and three stayed in Dalian, no longer coming to Shanghai. Because the Shanghai Bureau had remitted two thousand yuan on the evening of the twelfth, Captain Jiang immediately issued travel expenses of three yuan per person and another three yuan to send everyone on board. As for the travel expenses of the eleven passengers who came to Shanghai, they were all purchased by the bureau. Jiang Changqing negotiated with the Japanese shipping company in Dalian, but the Dalian Steamship Company refused to send them to Shanghai for free. As a result, sixty-five tickets were purchased for 1,040 yuan to come to Shanghai. Among these eleven passengers, there were two female passengers. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, the bureau gave each of them two yuan for travel expenses, instructing them to go home on their own. When Captain Jiang disembarked in Dalian, he also paid each stoker, sailor, and other crew member sixteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Second-Class Passenger's Demise</h3>
<p>According to a rescued crew member, Zheng Jinsheng, a second-class passenger, could have escaped. Relying on his swimming skills, after the *Tu Nan* broke into two sections, he re-entered the ship because the cash and clothes in his cabin had not been taken out. He did not expect that once he entered the ship, he could no longer get out. When the ship sank, the water had suction. Even if he could swim, it would be difficult to escape, resulting in his death. It is painful to talk about.</p>
<h3>Passenger Names</h3>
<p>This time, the *Tu Nan*'s voyage from Dalian to Shanghai carried more cargo and passengers than usual. The cargo included seven to eight hundred bags of salt, seven to eight hundred pieces of salted fish, more than two thousand pieces of fruit, 200,000 yuan in silver from the Bank of Communications, and a lot of other soybean cakes, grains, and groceries. Now that the ship has sunk, regarding the passengers, there were about 104 or 105 crew members, with 53 rescued, and more than 210 passengers, with 36 rescued. Excluding the 15 laborers who disembarked in Yingkou and those who were injured and still in the hospital in Dalian, only eleven passengers arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The names obtained are: (1) Zhang Sulin, (2) Liu Chan'gen, (3) Lu Xianglin, (4) Ye Enyuan, (5) Dai Songting, (6) Qin Dingchen, (7) Guo Yuanbiao, (8) Zhong Huizhang, (9) Xia Si, (10) Ms. Lin, (11) Ms. Qiu. The total number of deaths is over 230.</p>
<h3>All Circles Send Telegrams to Congratulate and Comfort Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>The Support Association Remits 5,000 Yuan</p>
<h3>Shanghai Forwarding and Customs Brokerage Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Commander-in-Chief Feng in Zhangjiakou, saying, "To Mr. Feng Huanzhang and all officers and soldiers at the front in Zhangjiakou: Reading the newspapers, we are delighted to learn of the recovery of Dolon. The patriotic blood of the three armies washes away the century-old shame of China. Bearing slander for the country, we admire your perseverance even more. We hope that you will not change your original intention, embrace the pain of killing the enemy, and strive for the glory of the nation. In this telegram, with tears, we cannot express all we want to say. The Shanghai Forwarding and Customs Brokerage Association kowtows."</p>
<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Feng Yuxiang, saying, "Commander-in-Chief Feng Yuxiang: We salute you. The recovery of Dolon has delighted the whole country. Our association has already sent a telegram to congratulate you. Now, we are allocating another 5,000 yuan to reward the various departments that have contributed to the effort. Please forward it to Fang Ji, Deng, Li, Zhang, and other gentlemen to encourage the soldiers to continue to advance and build new achievements. With this telegram, our thoughts are with you, and we eagerly await good news. Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association."</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Mr. Li Liejun</h3>
<p>After receiving the news of Feng Yuxiang's recovery of Dolon, he immediately sent a telegram to Feng expressing his congratulations and telegraphed the Central Government, requesting that real power be granted to Feng to jointly support the national crisis. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Mr. Li yesterday morning. According to him, since Feng Yuxiang announced his assumption of the post of Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, the situation has been chaotic and delayed for a month. Feng has always been determined to resist Japan and save the country. He refused any appointment from the central government and immediately sent troops to fight against the Japanese puppets. According to the telegrams, he has already recovered various places in eastern Chahar and captured Dolon. All circles in this city, upon hearing the news, were delighted and sent telegrams to Feng to express their admiration and encouragement. The telegrams I sent to the Central Government were sent out after being published in various newspapers. It is not yet known whether the Central Government will accept the proposal. The reporter then asked whether the Central Committee members staying in Shanghai would make a concrete expression or assistance to Feng's anti-Japanese military progress. Mr. Li said that the weather has been extremely hot in recent days, and he has not met with the Central Committee members staying in Shanghai, but they all admired and sympathized with Feng's anti-Japanese efforts. As for the issue of assistance, whether in spirit or material, everyone has a responsibility, which goes without saying.</p>
<h3>New Changes, Two Different Versions</h3>
<p>Wang Ziyao's Letter and Telegram, Zhao Fucheng's Talk. New Voice News Agency reports: After Ma Zhongying's defeat in the second Xinjiang incident, he is now counterattacking towards Dihua. As a result, there is a saying that traffic between Dihua and Lanzhou may be blocked again. However, Eurasia Aviation Corporation denies this. Yesterday, General Li Du's representative, Mr. Wang Ziyao, sent a letter and telegram report, which is recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhongying's Counterattack</h3>
<p>According to recent visitors from the Northwest, after Ma Zhongying was defeated by Sheng Shicai's forces in the Xinjiang incident, he retreated to Hami. However, his strength was still preserved and did not suffer a great loss. Rumors that Ma was killed in battle, that he was injured, and that his subordinates collapsed are all rumors. Although he was defeated, he recently contacted the Chantu people and his momentum has increased again. Using the Hami area as a base, he is counterattacking towards Dihua. Sheng Shicai still relies on Su and Li and is fighting against the old and new troops who retreated from Russia. As a result, the situation between Dihua and Hami is quite serious.</p>
<h3>Wang Ziyao Blocked</h3>
<p>According to a secret telegram from Secretary Wang Ziyao in Lanzhou received by General Li Du, "To Zhigong: Dihua and Hami are becoming increasingly deteriorated, making it impossible to go there. Huang (Musong)'s attendants Wang Yingyu and Xia Zhongyi are returning to Beijing. Please bring a detailed letter. Ask about the truth when the No. 1 plane arrives."</p>
<h3>Letter to Li Du Reports</h3>
<p>General Li Du, after receiving the telegram from his secretary Wang Ziyao, received a letter at noon when Eurasia's No. 1 plane arrived in Shanghai, reporting the situation in Xinjiang in detail. Although the letter is not allowed to be published, it is reported that it mainly reports that the unrest in Xinjiang has not yet been quelled. The Chantu people in the southern part of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang are still rioting. Ma Zhongying is currently inciting them. After arriving in Lanzhou, the plane could not proceed due to poor weather. The letter did not mention the situation in Dihua and Hami, as Lanzhou is still far from Dihua and Hami, and the details are not yet known.</p>
<h3>Traffic Remains Normal</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after the New Voice News Agency heard the news that traffic in the Northwest was blocked, it immediately called Mr. Li Jingcong, manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, to inquire. According to him, Li said that this was not true. He said that although the unrest in Xinjiang was said to be serious, it was not so serious. It is true that Wang Ziyao took a plane to Dihua last time and stopped in Lanzhou. The reason was said to be due to the serious unrest in Xinjiang, but on the other hand, it was indeed due to aviation weather and other reasons. Therefore, the plane that departed last week stopped in Lanzhou. However, this was a company measure to absolutely avoid political misunderstandings. Because our company is a business organization and has a considerable reputation in all aspects, the company must strive to further enhance this reputation. This is also a last resort. However, the Eurasia plane departing next Tuesday (i.e., tomorrow), no matter what, will send Wang Ziyao and others to Dihua when it arrives in Lanzhou.</p>
<h3>Huang's Return to Beijing Awaits</h3>
<p>Wang Yingyu and Xia Zhongyi, attendants of Xinjiang Pacification Commissioner Huang Musong, have arrived in Beijing on Eurasia's No. 1 plane to report to the Central Government. It is said that Huang is indeed being monitored in Xinjiang, but he is being treated well because Huang and Sheng Shicai were classmates and colleagues for more than two years in Beijing. Therefore, there is absolutely no problem with Huang's safety. It is expected that he will return to Beijing after the candidates for chairman and military governor of Xinjiang are determined.</p>
<h3>Zhao Fucheng's Talk</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Zhao Fucheng, representative of Ma Zhongying, commander of the 33rd Division of Gansu, recently took a plane from Xinjiang to Beijing, paying respects to various Central Committee members and then transferring to Jiangxi to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reporting the course of the Xinjiang Incident. Yesterday, Mr. Zhao came to Shanghai from Jiangxi. The reporter met him at the hotel and received the following statement. Xinjiang is located on the frontier, and communication is blocked and news is delayed. Since Jin Shuren's departure, various parties have not been familiar with the details of our division's entry into Xinjiang, and they have often been devalued based on one-sided rumors. In fact, the Central Government is very clear about the course of this incident, and I will not waste any more words. As for our division's leader leading his troops into Xinjiang, it was because an anti-Jin movement occurred within Xinjiang. The people of Xinjiang had suffered from Jin's poison for many years and had no way to speak out. The anti-Jin message came when military and civilian representatives begged our division's leader to lead his troops into Xinjiang to relieve the people's suffering. Our division, due to the righteousness of the situation, readily agreed to send troops, originally wanting to eliminate the trouble invisibly and avoid expanding the scope. Therefore, wherever the army went, all circles expressed their welcome. The situation before and after has been reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in separate telegrams. Those who do not know think that our division has sent troops without authorization, attempting to gain territory, and have fabricated rumors and slanders, and even fabricated facts to sow discord in many ways, even adding the name of communism. They also said that our division used the Han-Hui border to incite the Hui people, which is extremely vicious. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, our division was stationed in Hami, and Jin Shuren joined forces with Red Russia to attack us for no reason. Now, someone is adding communism to our division, which is not worth laughing at. Most of the officers and aides of our division are Han Chinese. If we were to draw a distinction between Han and Hui and incite the Hui people, it would be tantamount to breaking our own fences. Even the most foolish would not do this. In short, the truth of the matter will soon be revealed. Our division can only abide by the orders of the Central Government and wait for the government to send personnel to handle the matter, so as not to cause further incidents. I have come to Jiangxi this time on behalf of our division to pay respects to Chiang, and Chairman Chiang is very clear about the situation of our division and has instructed us to bring a letter to our division leader, the original text of which is as follows: "To Commander Zicai: Zhao's representative came, bringing your letter, and we talked about everything. We learned that you are loyal to the country, harmonious with the Han and Hui, and that your righteousness is clear, which is deeply gratifying. The Communist Party destroys human ethics and destroys the country. Anyone with a little knowledge knows its harm. With your intelligence and ability, you will definitely not blindly follow suit and be in cahoots with them. As for the Han and Hui, they are even more like brothers and sisters and have a long history of love. The Central Government relies on you as a pillar, and will not rashly provoke you, causing disaster to the frontier, causing strong neighbors to be suspicious, and inviting the enemy to burn ourselves. Therefore, we have repeatedly reported the two matters, and we all laughed at them and never believed them. (Omission) Among the generals in the Northwest, you are the most youthful and heroic. We have always loved and cared for you. We hope that you will cultivate yourself well and you will definitely become a great tool. The future is very promising. Therefore, we have repeatedly telegraphed you, earnestly advising you, and that is what we mean. (Omission) Chiang Kai-shek, July 4."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Representatives Go to Beijing to Fight for the Mortgage Rights of the Arsenal</h3>
<p>Whether the Sub-Mortgage Contract is Confirmed Depends Only on the Judgment of the Court. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Regarding the Mortgage Debt Case of the Arsenal, Military and Political Affairs Vice Minister Chen Yi once stated that the rights and interests of the creditor should be maintained, and that the issue of the existence of the mortgage contract should be decided by the Administrative Council. The Chamber of Commerce believes that this move by the government is not in line with the spirit of the rule of law. Therefore, representatives Wang Yansong and Lu Wenshao were specially sent to Beijing to fight for it with the Yuan and Ministry. The original text is recorded below. The case is that after the end of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War in the 13th year of the Republic of China, the provincial authorities entrusted the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to borrow commercial funds from silver and money businesses to pay for the demobilization of defeated soldiers, and for the supply and transportation of supplies. The former Beijing Ministry of Finance and the Army jointly ordered the Arsenal's base to be mortgaged, and gave official documents and receipts. It was stipulated that after the relocation of the factory, the land price of the factory site would be used to repay the advance payment. At that time, the manufacturing of machinery had been stopped, and the former General Chamber of Commerce was entrusted with safekeeping by the order of the Executive Yuan. All safekeeping expenses were also included in the aforementioned advance payment. Later, because the relocation of the factory was not implemented, the aforementioned mortgaged base could not be sold, and the principal and interest were suspended. The former General Chamber of Commerce listed each item in a clear list, and in September of the 17th year, requested the Ministry of Finance (Military Commission) to raise funds for repayment. Later, the Ministry of Finance (Jun) approved the matter, ordering that the receipts for each item of borrowing and appropriation listed in the list be copied and sent for review, and also ordered that the two items of borrowing listed in the list, the 30% of the land price of the Arsenal that Jiangsu Province should receive and the land price of the Welfare Company as mortgage, be included in the scope of provincial funds and repaid by Jiangsu Province, and the loss of foreign exchange should be eliminated. The former General Chamber of Commerce, on February 21st of the 18th year of the Republic of China, complied with the order and sent the printed receipts and bills for each item of borrowing for review, and also complied with the order to eliminate foreign exchange and include the two debts in the scope of provincial funds, and separately requested the provincial government to raise funds for repayment. Since the scope has been divided, the principal and interest of the items listed in the bill that fall within the scope of the central government, totaled 888,012 yuan, 3 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li as of November 30th of the 17th year. On March 4th of that year, the Ministry of Finance (Jun) issued approval No. 7841, stating that these advances for military aftermath were related to the local security at that time, and should be transferred to the Committee for the Consolidation of Internal and External Debts for handling after its establishment. In May of that year, the three chambers of commerce merged and formed a joint organization, and the Merchants Consolidation Committee acted on its behalf. Hearing that the Committee for the Consolidation of Internal and External Debts had been established, it also copied and sent the case of the Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce's advance payment for military and police to the Ministry of Finance (Jun), which approved it in No. 9265. The previous advances made by the Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce for military and police had been submitted by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance for appropriation and repayment. The Ministry had ordered the province to clear it up on its own and should contact the department directly. After a long period of time, the various commercial firms that had re-lent the funds at that time repeatedly inquired. At that time, the affiliated chamber had also been reorganized and established, succeeding the former three chambers of commerce's creditor rights and debts. On November 23rd of the 19th year, the Ministry of Finance (Jun) ordered the aforementioned borrowing case to be submitted to the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee for review and consolidation according to the bill. On December 18th of that year, the Ministry of Finance (Jun) issued approval No. 11571, stating that the funds had been approved to be included in the consolidation case, and that the list had been compiled and would be transferred to the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee for handling in the near future. The total principal and interest of the approved borrowings included in the consolidation scope amounted to 1,112,877 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen, and 7 li as of December of the 19th year. The two items under the name of the former General Chamber of Commerce that were included in the scope of Jiangsu Province's self-management, as well as the military and police funds advanced by the former Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce, were firmly denied by the provincial government. There was an official letter from the department requesting an investigation. In January of the 20th year, the affiliated chamber submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance (Jun) to determine responsibility, so as to avoid mutual evasion. So far, no approval has been received and it remains an unresolved case. This is a brief account of the past years. During the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Jiyi Company and Xu Pizhang and others had land disputes with the Shanghai Arsenal. The factory then reported to the former Military Commission to order the former General Chamber of Commerce to return the real estate deeds under its management due to mortgage rights. After the Chamber of Commerce argued based on legal principles, on May 10th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, it received a letter No. 5032 from the Ministry of Finance (Jun), stating that the contract of the Shanghai Arsenal and other documents were very important. In order to maintain the original case, the Ministry intended to have your Chamber of Commerce temporarily keep it, but should be fully responsible and should not sub-mortgage or sell it. Once the aforementioned advance payment is settled by the Committee for the Consolidation of Internal and External Debts, it should be transferred to the competent authority in full. It was also reported to the Executive Yuan for record. The current instruction states that it is approved to be handled as discussed, and the Military and Political Affairs Ministry should be notified accordingly. It is hereby requested to investigate and handle the matter accordingly. This is the most important key to this case, and there are several points that must be stated. (1) The so-called "definite method" in the original letter refers to a definite method of repayment. Once the debt is repaid, the mortgaged property should be returned. This is a common legal principle. (2) The factory land must be sold after the relocation of the factory is implemented. Therefore, the date of performance of this mortgage debt is very uncertain. The affiliated chamber's agreement to transfer the debt to the consolidation is for the purpose of expediting the repayment of the debt, and does not conflict with the retention of the mortgage rights. (3) The restriction against sub-mortgaging and selling is because the timing of the relocation of the factory is determined by the state. Therefore, the mortgage creditors cannot dispose of the property on their own. In other words, the mortgagee only has the right to participate in the handling of the matter when the relocation of the factory is implemented and the factory site is sold in order to protect its rights. Furthermore, the Ministry's letter in May of the 18th year can only be regarded as a supplement to the terms of the mortgage contract, and the establishment of the mortgage contract actually began in March of the 14th year. The boundary between them should not be disturbed. Based on the above process, if the Committee for the Consolidation of Internal and External Debts does not have a definite method for consolidation, and the factory property is sold first, the price of the sold land should be used to repay this advance payment first in accordance with the nature of the mortgage right. Since the "January 28th" Incident, the Shanghai Arsenal has been ordered to relocate. Reports have been seen in newspapers, and the lawyer Zhang Shizhao, commissioned by the factory, has officially informed the affiliated chamber. In order to protect the creditor rights, the affiliated chamber submitted requests to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs twice on March 15th and May 18th of this year, requesting them to fulfill the agreement and allocate funds for repayment after the factory property is sold. On June 16th, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs (Jun) issued approval No. 1569, stating that the Shanghai Arsenal is a central government property and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. No local civil or military officials may dispose of it. It is an illegal act to allocate it as collateral for borrowing funds and should not be recognized. The affiliated chamber then clarified to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs and the Executive Yuan that the factory property was used as collateral for the advance payment with the approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Army at that time, and the Ministry of the Army had issued a guarantee letter as proof. The so-called illegal act is an incorrect application of the term to the Ministry of the Army. National borrowing is also a private legal act. Once a contract is established, it is subject to the restrictions of civil law and cannot be denied arbitrarily by administrative order. After the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs (Jun) received this document, Vice Minister Chen replied to the chairman of the affiliated chamber in another letter, stating that the creditor rights should be maintained, but what should be deliberated is whether the central government property should be mortgaged for private military struggles, which is a matter of the authority of the two ministries and has been submitted to the Administrative Council for resolution. During the era of warlord rule, were not the bonds and treasury bills issued at that time all for military purposes? Were not the customs duties used as the internal debt fund a mortgage of central government property? After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it continued to fulfill the various customs-guaranteed debts of the Beijing government. Why is there suddenly a question about the debt secured by the factory property? Moreover, if it is said that the creditor rights must be maintained, then no matter what funds are needed for repayment in the future, will they not all come from the central government property? All of these are difficult to understand. If it is intended to transform a secured debt into an unsecured debt according to the meaning of the Ministry's letter, is it to maintain the interests of the creditors or to reduce the interests of the creditors? If what is said is true, why did the country not withdraw the guarantee from the various bonds guaranteed by customs duties, such as the Consolidation Six, Consolidation Seven, and Consolidation Seventy-Seven, and treat them the same as the Ninety-Six bonds? Such different treatment is not enough to demonstrate the country's fairness. Last year, the consolidation of bonds extended the repayment period and reduced the interest rate. The consent of the bondholders was obtained in advance and was not made unilaterally. Moreover, the funds borrowed for special projects are different from the policy of public debt. They are both legal acts. Only the court of jurisdiction has the power to judge whether to confirm or deny the mortgage contract. The state is also one of the contracting parties, and it wants to resolve the existence of the contract by the Administrative Council, which is no different from the debtor declaring the mortgage contract invalid. It goes without saying that this is impossible. The affiliated chamber, for the sake of protecting the rule of law, protecting the creditor rights, and taking care of the responsibility of the intermediaries who re-lent the funds, had no choice but to frankly state its views. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at the 42nd standing committee meeting on July 14th, and it was decided to publicly recommend Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong and Standing Committee Member Lu Wenshao to go to the Yuan and Ministry to sincerely present the case, so as to prevent the legally established mortgage contract from being shaken. The rationale is recorded and explained in detail, hoping that the Yuan and Ministry will review and approve it, and that it will be implemented in accordance with the original contract for the public convenience. In addition to submitting separately, it is hereby submitted to the Executive Yuan, Military Commission, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Military and Political Affairs.</p>
<h3>Li Du Entered Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Li Du, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, who was supposed to enter Beijing, was actually a mistake in relocation. Mr. Li waited for the report of Secretary Wang Ziyao, and only entered Beijing by night train last night. Yesterday afternoon, the Joint Association of Students of Shanghai Universities, the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of Shanghai Secondary Schools, and the Joint Association of Students of Shanghai Secondary Schools held a banquet at the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to welcome Generals Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Du. Generals Ma and Li, as well as Zhang Dianjiu, Pu Bingshan, Lang Guanpu, Jiang Songnian, Liu Piguang, and many other guests and hosts attended. Su did not participate due to illness. At the banquet, representatives from the three organizations gave welcome speeches, and Ma and Li both gave speeches. The banquet ended happily at about 2:00 pm. General Li left by night train to Beijing at 11:30 last night. He was accompanied by Secretary Liu Piguang, Counselor Jiang Yingxian, and others. Yang Hu, the head of the Municipal Security Office, and Li Dachao, the section chief of the Municipal Government, personally went to the station to see him off. It is reported that Mr. Li will stay in Beijing for a short time, and then go to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. He is expected to return to Shanghai in about ten days, and then go north to visit his relatives.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Advanced to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Contact the Central Government and Return to Shanghai; Northward Trip Scheduled in Ten Days. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Central Bank, took the 11:30 pm train to Beijing last night. Mr. Kong told the reporter of this newspaper in the train that he was going to Beijing this time to contact the central government and will return to Shanghai in the next few days to attend the Central Bank's executive meeting. As for the trip to the north, it is expected to be in about ten days. Previous reports that he was ordered to mediate the situation were mostly speculation. He originally intended to go to Peiping to attend the graduation ceremony of Yenching University, but this matter has passed, so it is okay to postpone the trip to the north.</p>
<h3>The Seller of the Tianchu Airplane is Fully Responsible</h3>
<p>Even if it cannot be repaired, a new machine will be replaced. The Tianchu fighter plane was damaged during a test flight due to the poor skills of the German technicians sent by the Junkers factory, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Tianchu factory has paid about 80,000 yuan in national currency, and there is still a third installment of more than 30,000 yuan that has not been paid. According to the contract, the payment will only be made after the test flight is satisfactory and the formal delivery is completed. There is no problem with the negotiation between the Tianchu factory and the Junkers factory, because the responsibility for this matter should be fully borne by the seller, which is very clear. Junkers is one of the largest factories in Germany, and its representative in Shanghai, Zenchsen, is a reputable German firm. Therefore, even if it is impossible to repair the original condition in the future, a new machine will be replaced, and there will be no evasion of responsibility for this transaction of tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Capital Increase of North City Goods Bank</h3>
<p>Investors Deny the Name of Guanghoutang. The Stackers Remain Orderly Despite the Strike. There are a total of forty or fifty land goods firms along the Suzhou River in Xinzha, Laozha, and Touba. There are twenty-three in Laozha, and each firm employs about thirty or more stackers. The firms only provide food and lodging, and their wages are drawn from the proceeds of the sale of goods. This has been planned for a long time. Now, due to the increasing cost of living, workers in various industries have increased their wages. Therefore, the stackers of the twenty-three land goods firms in the Laozha Bridge area took advantage of the busy season of watermelon sales and suddenly went on strike yesterday morning, demanding an increase in wages, about a few cents to one or two cents per item. For example, the carrying fee for watermelons (about two hundred catties) was originally eight cents, but now they want to increase it to one jiao. The investors believe that the workers did not make a request in advance, and now they are suddenly on strike, which is not appropriate. They appointed three representatives, Jin Xuegui, Yang Guid, and Zhang Quansheng, to persuade the workers to resume work. As for the wage issue, they will convene a meeting of the industry association to discuss and implement it immediately. The workers refused. Currently, the stackers in Xinzha and Touba have not joined the strike, and the investors' announcement firmly denies the new stacker rules proposed by the workers. The situation is quite serious. The announcements and leaflets from both labor and capital are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Labor Leaflet</h3>
<p>(Industry Consensus) Dear Sirs, Our industry is engaged in commerce on behalf of customers and only charges a commission. The hired stackers are only provided with food and lodging. However, wages are customarily calculated and drawn from the proceeds of the sale of goods. Recently, the stackers have expressed that the prices of all goods are rising, and the seven necessities of life are difficult to maintain. They have no choice but to declare that it is difficult to make a living and request a reasonable increase in stacking fees to maintain their livelihoods. After observing that their situation is indeed true, we specially invited colleagues to the meeting. After repeated discussions, it was concluded that the amount of each increase is very small, and it is ultimately not harsh on the customer side, but it is a small supplement to the stacker side. Therefore, a special leaflet is printed and distributed, and each must always abide by it and not disturb the rules. This announcement, the agreed stacking fees are listed on the left. Regardless of cash, foreign currency, or code, all are calculated at 95% discount. The foreign price is based on the invoice. Clips, carrying baskets, bamboo carrying poles, and ropes are all prepared by each firm. Changshu reverse wheat is one jiao per carry. Plums, peaches, plums, and loquats are all six li per unit. Lusu and Shajiao water caltrop (per calculation) and Hao Bai (per bundle), white radish, snow cabbage, cabbage, big Mao cabbage, Jiading Pudong small melon, eggplant, edamame, garlic, Hu onion, yam, Shagua (all above are per foreign), bag head yam (per bag), lily (per unit), potato taro (per bag) are all five fen. Mud radish, Hao Bai, water clips, small guest melon, wind water caltrop, winter melon, watermelon, pumpkin, Mao taro, red and white yam, large and small broad beans are all one jiao per carry. Shacai is two jiao and a half per hundred pieces, Jiaocai is two jiao and a half per hundred pieces, Hangzhou goods are three fen per piece, Qing sugarcane is one fen and two li per bundle, red sugarcane is one fen per bundle, Su lotus root is in accordance with the original rules, Yangmei is six li per unit, yam is two fen out of the bag, Pudong large and small cabbage is five fen per foreign, Pudong pearl rice small bundle is five fen per foreign, and loading this goods into the car is three fen per unit. Ordered by the Old Zha Bridge Guanghoutang Shuiguo Land Goods Public Office, British Concession, July 15, 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Investors' Announcement</h3>
<p>(Important Announcement) Dear Sirs, This association recently received an informally named letter requesting a resolution to increase stacking fees. Later, it received a joint list of stackers from each firm, along with two documents listing the number of stacking fees newly ordered by the Xihoutang Shuiguo Public Office from July 15th of the 22nd year. It was secretly sent to the association. It is found that the Guanghoutang of this industry was a group in the past. It has long been abolished in accordance with the laws and regulations of the National Government and reorganized into the current industry association, and it has been approved by the party and government organs for filing. Recently, unscrupulous people have borrowed the name of the former industry group to print and distribute stacking fee lists without authorization, stealing and infringing on the legal interests of this association. This is a disregard for the law. In addition to reporting to the authorities for investigation after finding out the names and addresses of the leaders, this is an appropriate notification, hoping for your reference, and please do not accept the request for the illegal new stacking fee number, which is very important. To the Bao Bank of Shanghai Land Goods Industry Association, July 15, 22nd.</p>
<h3>Striking Firms</h3>
<p>Zhengtai, Yongsheng, Longyuanshun, Yongchang, Yongshun, Futai, Heji, Longshun, Yuanda, Yida, Shengchang, Yiji, Detai, Yingtai, Gongji, Tongcheng, etc., a total of twenty-three (including seven branches of each firm), are all located in the Laozha Bridge area. When the stackers of each firm went on strike yesterday morning, the Laozha Police Station heard the news and was deeply afraid of disturbing public order. It specially dispatched many detectives to the scene to suppress the situation. The stackers all strictly maintained order and no accidents occurred. It is reported that the owners of several firms, seeing the forest of watermelon boats under the river, secretly dredged the stackers and carried and refuted as usual.</p>
<h3>Mediation of the Electric Power Workers' Strike Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>The company refuses to accept four conditions. Workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the issue of requesting the payment of retirement money to Foreman Yang Aqiao, caused a dispute. The company authorities then dismissed the union director Ni Wenfu and other four people, causing the strike to become more serious. Chinese Director Yuan Lvdeng, at the request of the workers, mediated with the company authorities the day before, but there was no result. It is still intended to continue consultations to resolve it. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Mediation Process</h3>
<p>Since the strike became more serious, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in order to prevent expansion, dispatched Executive Committee Member Shao Xubai to accompany the union representatives to visit Chinese Director Yuan Lvdeng and request him to serve as mediator. Mr. Yuan, also for the sake of both parties' interests and public utilities, drove to the general company on Jiangxi Road at 10:00 am the day before (15th) to mediate. When the deputy director He Ete asked for leave due to illness, Hopkins represented the reception. Mr. Yuan first stated his intention and hoped that the company would take into account the lives of the workers and give considerable understanding to avoid causing major disputes. Mr. Huo expressed his gratitude for Mr. Yuan's good-faith mediation, but believed that those who were dismissed were indeed intentionally creating disturbances and inciting strikes, so it was impossible to reinstate them. As for the issue of retirement money, the company stipulates that those who retire due to employee reduction will be given retirement money, but if they are dismissed for mistakes or voluntarily resign, the company is not convenient to pay. Regarding the issue of pension funds, the company's established methods are extremely accommodating, and there is no problem. Yuan Huo Shangda spent an hour or so, but in the end, due to the company's firm attitude, no satisfactory result was obtained.</p>
<h3>Workers' Anger</h3>
<p>Since the strike occurred, the Fourth District Water and Electricity Union convened a joint meeting of all old and new factory leaders and decided to put forward four conditions to the company. While discussing with Yuan Lvdeng to serve as mediator, it also sent the original text of the conditions in a formal letter to the company. However, the company ordered the dispatch department to refuse to receive the letter. Mr. Yuan went to mediate in good faith, but was refused. Therefore, the workers were angry and convened a meeting yesterday to decide to send representatives to the Prime Minister today to present their case.</p>
<h3>The General Committee Expresses</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Shao Xubai, Executive Committee Member of the General Federation of Trade Unions, the Electric Power Company is a public utility. Once a strike breaks out, it will inevitably affect the entire society, which is of great importance. Therefore, he requested Chinese Director Yuan Lvdeng to serve as mediator in the hope that the factory would understand and eliminate the dispute. However, the factory insisted on its original proposal and refused to make concessions, which is deeply regrettable. However, according to Mr. Yuan Lvdeng, although the factory's attitude in this case is firm, it has not completely broken down. If the workers can revise the conditions they have proposed, there may still be room for mediation. Therefore, I have informed the workers to discuss and revise the conditions. After that, I will ask Mr. Yuan to continue the mediation to ensure that the case can be resolved as soon as possible. But if the factory is still not sincere, the company should bear full responsibility for any disputes caused by this.</p>

<h3>Re-Eastern Zhu Jiqing Department Cables Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Temporarily Retreating to Wait for Opportunity to Counterattack. The National Salvation Army of Zhu Jiqing's department in Red Border joined forces with the militia to fight a bloody battle this month. They advanced and retreated repeatedly, extremely heroically. Finally, due to the enemy's fierce artillery fire, they withdrew to a certain place at Wen Wan and will reorganize before planning a counterattack. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than a thousand casualties, and our losses were also heavy. The following are two telegrams received by a certain party. (A) Supervisor Jun Jian (1) On the North Road, there was another fierce battle at Che Gulu Shop this afternoon. The enemy retreated westward to Guangfu Camp in the evening, burning two villages along the way. (2) The enemy on the East Road advanced to Sanjiazi again, destroying many houses. (3) The enemy on the South Road advanced to Weijiazi again in the evening, more than twenty li away from Badaowan. It is expected that there will be a more fierce battle today. (4) Since the start of the war, the enemy's casualties have reached more than a thousand. Zhi Ting bows at Wen Chen.</p>
<p>(B) Supervisor Jun Jian, Since the start of the war, the military's morale has been boosted and the people's spirit has been aroused, so they can retreat and advance repeatedly, thwarting their fierce attack. It should have continued to work hard and persisted to the end. However, due to the disparity in equipment, it is ultimately impossible to defeat the enemy with flesh and blood, and isolated and without support, the losses are heavy and should be vigorously replenished. Since this morning, the situation on each road has become more urgent, so the decision has been made to temporarily withdraw to retreat in order to gather and reorganize before planning a counterattack when the opportunity arises. Sincerely, Zhi Ting bows at Wen Xu.</p>

<h3>Zhang Piaofang Returns to Shanghai to Discuss the Recent Situation of Overseas Chinese in Nanyang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese United Association dispatched its executive committee member Zhang Piaofang in March of this year to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the situation of overseas Chinese in the Nanyang area. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his mission. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Zhang's private residence for an interview. According to Mr. Zhang, the purpose of his trip was to solicit members and report to the overseas Chinese in various locations on the recent work of the United Association, as well as to investigate the opposition to postal rate increases. He found that the overseas Chinese in Saigon, Luobin Penang, Singapore, and other places were experiencing significant declines in business and major impacts on their lives due to the oversupply of rubber, rice, and tin in the market. In addition, the Sino-French Vietnam commercial treaty had been negotiated but not yet signed, and the situation in Siam was the same. In the event of an incident, they were treated as if they were from a country with no treaty. Therefore, they strongly opposed the postal rate increases, he said.</p>

<h3>Three Additional Pairs of Long-Distance Telephone Lines Between Beijing and Shanghai to Be Completed by Year-End</h3>
<p>Total Expenditure of Over 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the current single pair of long-distance telephone lines between Beijing and Shanghai is insufficient. Given the close relationship between the two cities and the need for rapid communication, it is planning to expand the network to speed up transmission. It has now been decided to add three pairs of lines. Detailed plans have been drawn up, and the necessary materials have been purchased from abroad. The total cost is estimated to be over 400,000 yuan. The materials are expected to arrive in Shanghai around October, and installation will begin. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of the year, which will greatly improve telephone communication between Beijing and Shanghai. However, reports of reduced call charges are said to be inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ship Encountered Bandits and Fought Fiercely on the Sea off Haimen</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Crew Members Were Killed or Wounded, Four Were Kidnapped, and the Cargo and Silver Were Looted, Resulting in Losses of Over 10,000 Yuan. According to the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association, Guo Sheng, a Fujianese merchant from Shenjiamen, had a large merchant ship that, after unloading goods in Shandong, was sailing off the coast of Haimen the day before yesterday when it suddenly encountered two pirate ships. The pirates opened fire and ordered the ship to stop. The ship's captain, Guo Qiulong, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately ordered the crew to return fire. After about an hour of fighting, the pirate ships opened fire with machine guns and threw hand grenades. The merchant ship was immediately filled with smoke, making it impossible to see. The pirates took advantage of the chaos to board the ship. By this time, four crew members had been killed, more than ten were seriously injured, and eight crew members had been kidnapped. Four of the kidnapped crew members were later released. The pirates seized three locally-made machine guns, seven rapid-firing rifles, and one wooden-cased pistol. They also looted all of the ship's cargo and silver, resulting in a total loss of approximately 10,000 yuan. During the pirates’ retreat, they encountered the Yongping patrol ship, and another half-hour battle ensued. The Yongping patrol ship originally intended to eliminate the pirate ships in one fell swoop, but due to the large number of refugees on board the pirate ships, it had to let them sail away. Later, the pirate ships released the captured ships because there were too many of them for easy navigation. Yesterday, the large merchant ship returned to Shenjiamen and docked. Crew members Deng Qiulong, Wang Alai, Guo Guoqing, and others were seriously injured and were sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>A Girl Died from Opium Used to Treat Dysentery</h3>
<p>The Mother Was Too Ignorant</p>
<p>Zhao Shen, a 38-year-old woman from Ningbo, who lived at 12 Dongyouheng Road, gave her two-year-old daughter, Yinmei, a small amount of opium dissolved in water to treat her severe dysentery. About an hour later, Yinmei's complexion suddenly changed dramatically, becoming pale and her body began twitching uncontrollably. Greatly alarmed, the woman sent her daughter to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died soon after. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Zhao Shen. The girl's body was taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. Yesterday, the police station sent her to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the girl's body had been taken to the autopsy room for examination. Judge Wu briefly questioned Zhao Shen, ordered her to be detained, and rescheduled the hearing. Later, the Special Court commissioned prosecutor Guo to conduct an autopsy, which confirmed that Yinmei's death was caused by accidental opium poisoning. The body was released to her mother, Shen, to be placed in a coffin and buried after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3>A Korean Prostitute Ran Off After a Customer Offered Her a Ride</h3>
<p>The Pimp, Er Bao, Was Helpless and Reported to the Police Station Requesting an Investigation. Li Di, located at No. 82 Changxingfang, Gelok Road, French Concession, is one of the most famous Korean brothels in Shanghai. The proprietress of the brothel, nicknamed Paige Er Bao, lives at No. 25 Sanxin Lane, Aigel Road. She usually has many prostitutes in her establishment. One of them, named Aihua, is 29 years old, from Wuxi. She is graceful and charming by nature. She has been raised by the proprietor Er Bao since childhood, so she is very protective of her. She was once very popular at the Yan Yuan near Zhujia Bridge.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the strict tax inspections by the police, Aihua temporarily stopped her prostitution business and rested at home. However, she could still be flexible if regular customers called. Aihua usually liked to watch movies. Whenever a famous film was released, she would be sure to see it first. At 9:15 PM the night before, she went to the Nanjing Grand Theater on Aiduo'a Road to watch the latest American Fox Company production, "The Land of Daughters." When the show ended at 11:10 PM, Aihua walked out of the theater, intending to take her private chartered car home. However, when she passed the entrance of the Rixin Pool Bathhouse on Weier Meng Road, a familiar customer, Mr. Jia, stopped the chartered car and insisted on inviting Aihua to go for a ride. Aihua readily agreed, and the two got into the black car parked on the side of the road and sped off to the west. When the chauffeur reported back to the proprietor, the proprietor was shocked, because she knew that Mr. Jia was not a good person. As of yesterday morning, Aihua had not returned home. She immediately reported to the police station requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Merchants and Vegetable Vendors of Jiangyin Street Submit a Document to the Social and Financial Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Building a Vegetable Market on Chezhan Road Wastes Public Funds</p>
<p>Reversing the Decision and Withdrawing the Order Will Satisfy Public Expectations</p>
<p>The merchants and vegetable vendors of Jiangyin Street in southern Shanghai submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Vegetable Market Construction Committee of the Finance Bureau yesterday to maintain the original vegetable market and request a change in the plan to build a vegetable market on Chezhan Road, withdrawing the order to provide relief and satisfy public expectations. The original text reads, "Submission for Request: Your association believes that building a vegetable market behind the South Railway Station will not benefit the citizens, may lead to the bankruptcy of Jiangyin Street businesses, and may cause vegetable vendors to lose money. Therefore, we have presented reasons to the Public Works Bureau to temporarily suspend construction and clarified various reasons, including that building a vegetable market behind the South Railway Station will waste public funds. We have respectfully submitted a document to the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government requesting the withdrawal of the construction order, etc. Now, we have received the Public Works Bureau's No. 2473 approval, which states that 'We have received the submission. After investigation, the Shanghai Charity Association has submitted a request to the Finance Bureau for approval to build a vegetable market on Chezhan Road, and the Construction Committee has approved the construction. Therefore, this bureau has approved the construction permit.' Therefore, we respectfully request your bureau to consider the difficulties of the merchants and follow public opinion, changing the approved construction of the vegetable market on Chezhan Road, withdrawing the order to provide relief and maintain the merchants and vendors. We beg you to examine and approve it and forward it to the Vegetable Market Construction Committee of the Finance Bureau to change the plan, so as to satisfy public expectations and appease the people. If approved, not only will the business of hundreds of merchants be maintained, and the business of more than four hundred vegetable vendors be preserved, but also the livelihoods of the families of the merchants and vegetable vendors will be maintained. Otherwise, the impact will be unimaginable. In addition to submitting a separate document to the Vegetable Market Construction Committee of the Finance Bureau requesting a change in the plan and withdrawal of the order to avert disaster, we respectfully submit (the document to the Finance Bureau is omitted)."</p>

<h3>Murderous Drama at Xixin Bridge Last Night</h3>
<p>Amao Avenged Himself by Stabbing Agen</p>
<p>Han Agen, a 33-year-old unemployed vagrant from Jiading, rented a room at No. 9 Zhizhong Lane, Xixin Bridge Street, French Concession. His landlord, named Amao, was also a scoundrel. In the past, Han had helped his old man invite Amao to tea to reason with him. At that time, Amao was unreasonable and at a loss for words, and he had lost face. As a result, Amao harbored resentment and vented his anger on Han Agen. He had long harbored thoughts of revenge. At 9:30 PM last night, Amao learned that Agen was about to pass by the intersection of Xixin Bridge and Fadama Road. He hid there with a sharp blade. Shortly after, Han leisurely approached. Old enemies are especially vigilant. Amao rushed up, pulled out the sharp blade, and stabbed him in the back and left shoulder, about an inch deep. Blood flowed freely. Seeing that he had committed a serious crime, the murderer quickly fled into the alley and disappeared without a trace. When the nearby police heard the alarm and arrived, the murderer had already flown away like a crane into the unknown. The police used a car to send the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Han's injuries were not serious and his life was not in danger. Subsequently, the hospital reported to the Dadazimingzhong police station, which ordered Detective No. 12 to investigate the incident, track down the murderer, and bring him to justice for prosecution.</p>
<h3>A Man with Syphilis Committed Suicide Because He Could Not Afford Treatment</h3>
<p>Tang Yaoting's Situation Was Pitiful</p>
<p>Tang Yaoting, a 23-year-old man from Haimen, worked alone in Shanghai selling Fang gao and mint cakes. He borrowed a room on the third floor of Qiu Qiwu's house, located at No. 16 Kangti Lane, Kangti Road, French Concession. He was from the same hometown and worked in the same industry. He went out early and returned late every day. Because he liked women, he contracted syphilis and could not be cured. Recently, because he had no money to seek medical treatment and his illness worsened, he felt that life was meaningless and had a sudden suicidal thought. On the night before last, he took advantage of the fact that his roommate was asleep, sneaked up to the drying platform, and hanged himself from the clothes rack with his belt. It wasn't until the landlady's daughter, Yinmei, went upstairs to dry clothes yesterday morning that she discovered him. Tang had already died and his body was stiff, so there was no way to save him. She immediately reported to the French police station, which sent detectives to the scene to take down the body and send it to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy room. No family members were found, and it was reported to the Second Special District Court today to send someone for examination.</p>
<h3>One Woman Married Two Husbands, the Father-in-Law Was Too Absurd</h3>
<p>The First Husband Sued and Brought the Case to Court</p>
<p>The Second Husband Still Wanted to Claim His Wife</p>
<p>Lin Bitong, a 47-year-old man from Gaoyou, lived on Lan Ni Du Street in Pudong. His daughter, Lin Zhaozhu, was 20 years old and had some beauty. Lin arranged for her to marry Ni Jiarong, a fellow villager from Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. Ni was 22 years old and worked in a factory. His monthly salary was enough to provide for the family. He married Lin Zhaozhu two years ago, and the couple's relationship was fairly harmonious. Lin Bitong's family was originally poor and relied on his daughter's labor to supplement the family income. Since his daughter got married, the source of income was cut off, and his livelihood was difficult. Therefore, he had a strange idea: he summoned his daughter back home and secretly discussed remarrying her to another family in the hope of receiving a betrothal gift. It happened that there was a fellow villager, Hou Dianyin, a 21-year-old coppersmith, who was still single because his family was poor. He asked someone to propose marriage and marry Lin Zhaozhu. They lived together at No. 19 Yuanyu Lane, Jiaotong Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Zhabei. Ni Jiarong searched for his wife, Lin Zhaozhu, who had left under the false pretense of returning to Ningbo, and went to his father-in-law's house to bring her back. His father-in-law, Lin Bitong, claimed that his daughter had never returned to Ningbo. Ni negotiated with him, but to no avail, and he left dejectedly. He secretly inquired and learned that Lin had remarried his daughter to another family. He was filled with anger and reported to the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Investigator Yin Zhengtian took Lin Bitong into custody. He confessed that his daughter, Zhaozhu, had remarried Hou Dianyin and lived in Zhabei. Then, Investigator Yin, together with the plaintiff Ni Jiarong and Lin Bitong, went to the police station and stated the previous situation. They dispatched police officers to No. 19 Yuanyu Lane, Jiaotong Road, and arrested Lin Zhaozhu in the house. Hou Dianyin had already left. They took the woman to the station. While questioning her, Hou Dianyin suddenly arrived at the station and admitted that he was Lin Zhaozhu's husband and demanded that his wife be returned to him. The police station immediately arrested him and escorted them to the General Bureau for interrogation at 7:30.</p>
<h3>Two People Electrocuted to Death</h3>
<p>Song Meisheng: Lu Rongji, the owner of Lujinji Bun and Rice Restaurant at No. 143 Fumin Road, Dananmen, Nanshi, recently started his business and only had one electric light installed downstairs. He planned to continue installing electric lights upstairs after his business had developed a little. However, at about 10:00 PM the night before last, Song Meisheng, a 25-year-old worker at the restaurant, connected the electric light wire from downstairs to upstairs to go to bed in the dark. Unfortunately, he accidentally touched the electric current and fell to the ground and died instantly. When the restaurant owner, Lu Rongji, found out, he reported to Jin Dianyang, the head of the Third Section of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who ordered police officer Wang to investigate the incident. Because it was a homicide case, he ordered the local guarantor to report to the local court yesterday morning. In the afternoon, the court appointed a prosecutor to examine the body at the scene and reported the case to the General Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>Dai Xiaolin</h3>
<p>Dai Xiaolin, 33 years old, from Nanxi, worked in a silk weaving factory on Kangti Road, French Concession. At 10:00 PM the day before yesterday, he went to the Daqi Silk Weaving Factory opened by his friend Wang Bida at No. 26 Tongde Lane, Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, to chat. Because the electric lights in the factory were leaking electricity, Dai repaired them. As he was installing a light bulb, Dai was suddenly electrocuted and fell to the ground, dying instantly. Black marks were found all over his body. The factory owner, Wang Bida, reported to the head of the Second Section of the Fourth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who ordered police officers to the scene for investigation. He also ordered the local guarantor to report to the local court. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the court appointed a prosecutor and a coroner to drive to the scene of the accident for examination. The examination confirmed that the deceased died from electrocution. The prosecutor ordered the deceased's mother and brothers to claim the body for burial and reported the case to the Bureau Chief. It is said that the deceased's family demanded that the factory provide generous compensation and funeral expenses.</p>
<h3>Western Police Officer Smith Drowned</h3>
<p>A Western police officer named Smith from the vehicle department of the Fourth Malu General Police Station drowned yesterday morning. At 11:00 AM, he and three male and three female friends were taking a police boat to the beach in Gaoqiao Township for swimming.

<h3>Dahua Pharmacy Manager Sun Pingjie and Others Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>After Dahua Pharmacy went bankrupt, its chairman, Liu Hongsheng, who is now the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, and its supervisor, Yuan Mengqin, who is now the assistant manager of the Quanggong Bank, and its manager, Sun Pingjie, were sued for fraud in the First Special District Court by creditor Qianxin Foreign Firm and others. The pharmacy and the plaintiff reached a peaceful settlement out of court, so the case was not heard and the plaintiff applied to withdraw the lawsuit. However, now many more waves of lawsuits have arisen. Many creditors are suing its manager, Sun Pingjie, for fraud. These include Taihe Pharmacy, Xue Ludun Pharmacy, Xinghua Foreign Firm, Shenchang Foreign Firm, Dou'anxi Western Medicine Company, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Shunfa Foreign Firm, Cele Foreign Firm, Weiliansi Western Medicine Company, Lihe Foreign Firm, Haichang Foreign Firm, Baocheng Foreign Firm, Lao Jinlong Foreign Firm, Buneimen Foreign Firm, Xianling Foreign Firm, and others. The total amount of unpaid debts reached more than 25,000 yuan. They all claimed that Dahua Pharmacy sold the goods at a reduced price after purchasing them on credit and suddenly declared liquidation when the repayment date was approaching. This behavior constituted fraud, so they jointly sued him. In addition, the Gongyixiang Paint Shop at No. 7 Ningshao Lane, Jiangxi Road, was owed 4,480 yuan and also sued Sun. In April of this year, Datong Cotton Gauze Factory on Jin Shenfu Road sold goods worth 4,735 yuan to Dahua Pharmacy on credit because Dahua Pharmacy claimed to be contracted by the Nanjing Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to supply gauze and cotton. The repayment was due on the Dragon Boat Festival, but the pharmacy went bankrupt one day before the festival, which was intentional fraud. Therefore, the factory sued the pharmacy's assistant manager, Zhang Yiming, and Sun Pingjie together. Although the above seventeen creditors filed three separate lawsuits, the facts of the case were the same. Therefore, Judge Deng Baosun of the First Special Court simultaneously heard the case yesterday afternoon. The defendant, Sun Pingjie, did not appear.

<p>Su Xiaomao Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhou Changfa, a resident of Pudong living in a bungalow on Heilong Road, has a seventeen-year-old daughter named Gendi. She is beautiful and petite, cherished by her father. Recently, Gendi was lured by Su Xiaomao, a neighbor and fellow townsman, to the Tangshan Hotel on Tangshan Road. They stayed in a room together for several nights. However, because the girl returned home at night, Zhou did not suspect anything. On the third of this month, Zhou Gendi told her father she was going to visit relatives but did not return. Zhou Changfa, having lost his daughter, searched everywhere without success, sighing and lamenting until the seventh, when he finally learned that his daughter had been lured to the Tangshan Hotel by Su Xiaomao.

Su Xiaomao claimed that the girl voluntarily went to the hotel with him several times and that this time he asked her to go home, but she refused, leading to his arrest. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao sentenced Su Xiaomao to one year of imprisonment, with each two days of pre-trial detention counting as one day of the sentence.</p>

She has retained a lawyer and filed the suit with the First Special District Court. The court summoned both parties for questioning, and a hearing was concluded. The original judgment was scheduled for the 30th of last month, but because one party submitted additional documents, a new hearing was held yesterday. The plaintiff, Jin Ye, stated that her husband died thirteen years ago and left behind only one daughter, now eighteen. Her father-in-law passed away last year, and he had two children from each of his two marriages. Now only one younger brother-in-law and one younger sister-in-law remain. The estate includes three pieces of land, which should be divided equally according to the law. The defendant did not appear but was represented by lawyer Shen Xingxia, who argued that the land mentioned by the plaintiff was mostly mortgaged and that the plaintiff had not clearly stated how she wanted the property divided. Changchun had more children than the plaintiff claimed, a total of ten, and all of Changchun’s children should be considered in any division of property. He submitted a list of these children. The plaintiff countered that the other children had died young. Judge Yang, believing that such family disputes were best resolved peacefully, adjourned the case and urged both parties to seek an amicable settlement.</p>

<h3>Musings on Nets</h3>
<p>"Eastern Fish" holds a significant position in the vegetable market. The astonishing yield of "Eastern Fish" made me suddenly realize the exquisite fishing techniques of Japanese fishermen and further associated it with the power of the "nets" used for fishing.</p>
<p>I remember Japan having two "lifelines." One is the "land lifeline," centered on the Northeast. The other is the "sea lifeline," which is the German-owned South Pacific Islands. The "land lifeline," centered on Dalian, desperately stretches vertically and lays horizontally, eventually forming a web, a "big net" over my entire Northeast, and the "fisherman reaps the benefits." This particularly abundant "catch" is indeed "heaven-sent" to the fishermen, but "when drinking water, remember the source," one cannot "forget the net after eating the fish."</p>
<p>The "sea lifeline" is the axis of the "net" needed by fishermen fishing in the South China Sea. The expansion of airplanes and warships in recent years is to complete this "big net." If this "big net" is not punched a hole by a large fish, then the "Eastern Fish" caught by this big net will inevitably squeeze out the markets of Europe and America.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation these past few days, Japanese fishermen seem to be conducting "net" construction work between Vladivostok and Sakhalin Island. The "bait" they used in the Northeast was "Captain Nakamura." Now they are using "three fishermen" as "bait" in a modified but essentially the same way, and want to come back for another "full load." However, "salmon" is more resilient. Whether it can be captured as easily as "Chinese fish" is hard to say.</p>
<p>It is said that Japanese fishermen now also want to move the center point of Dalian to Qingdao, start all over again, and use another "net" to turn all the yellow croaker, net fish, loach, and earthworm in the Baihe River, Yellow River, and even the Northwest Plateau into "Eastern Fish." The "fishing techniques" of Japanese fishermen have long been admired. Once the "big net" is built, why worry about not having a "grand opening" and "netting success"?</p>
<p>Japanese fishermen repeatedly spread "nets" horizontally and vertically. We, who are not caught by their hooks and are temporarily "fish that slipped through the net," will, when they "drain the pond to catch all the fish," and the four hundred million compatriots "enter the net in droves," ready to be captured and cooked by the fishermen, or displayed in abalone shops, whether we will still have the leisure to praise thighs and champagne is a question.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Collecting Plants by Zhong Xianchang Ah Jie</h3>
<p>To save China, one must first think from a scientific perspective. The so-called "science" of course has a very broad scope. Science on paper and science in the style of peddling are actually useless. Therefore, I dare not approve of the science currently taught in schools. As a result, I thought of Mr. Zhong Xianchang of Zhenhai.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong was originally a literary figure. During the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, he did not study law and politics, nor did he study medicine. Of course, he did not have the idea of becoming an official or a councilor. He actually liked to study animals, plants, and physics and chemistry, which can be said to have started a national trend. At this time, those who studied natural sciences were only Mr. Du Yaquan, Du Jiutian, Zhang Xiujue, Xie Honglai, Wu Zhihui, and Ma Junwu. He founded the School of Science in Shanghai. It is said that Mr. Cai Jiemin also enrolled and studied there.</p>
<p>Now, he should be able to become an official, enjoy his twilight years, and we cannot say anything wrong about an old senior. However, he has some eccentricities, working diligently and still studying every grass and insect, running east and west, restless, as if extremely interested. People in the country do not know that there is an old gentleman in our country who "exhausts things in his white hair."</p>
<p>In recent years, in order to collect plants from all over the country, Mr. Zhong has traveled north to the north and south to Vietnam, traversing Chu, Min, Gui, and Dian. His footprints have almost covered the entire country, and the specimens of rare flowers and jade grasses he collected are truly remarkable. One year, Mr. Zhong went deep into a certain mountain in Fujian Province, cutting through reeds and thorns, climbing cliffs and wading through streams. He would sometimes not speak. The prefect asked him why, and he said: "I'm afraid the adults will find it strange." The prefect said: "Just say it, it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>He said: "The third is the face of the adults."</p>
<p>The face of the adults, placed in the third position, is of course uglier than the private parts of women and the buttocks. However, during an autopsy, the private parts of the female corpse are usually covered with damp paper. Even if you look at it, it's only for a moment. If the buttocks of the prisoner are beaten severely, the magistrate can also turn his head away, or even lift his sleeves like in a play, and cover his own face, and that's it. In fact, it's better to look, it's better to look more. Don't you think everyone loves curves now? These two things, the private parts of women and the buttocks, are the most curved parts of the line, the focal points of beauty. When the magistrate encounters an autopsy or beating, he can specifically appreciate them, and compare them to looking at the model in an oil painting. There should be a distinction between on-site investigation and scratching an itch. This really can't be considered ugly.</p>
<p>Only the face of the adults, pulled down, is as iron-green as a dead person, and as hideous as an evil ghost, causing fear at first sight. Damp paper can't stop it, the head can't turn, and the sleeves don't dare to be lifted. The uglier it is, the more you have to look at it. It's really unspeakable suffering!</p>
<p>Now, the respectful address of the adults has been eliminated, but the faces of the adults are still there, and you don't necessarily have to see them in the yamen. In the concession, the patrolmen will put on the faces of the adults. In the shops, the clerks will put on the faces of the adults. There are endless more. The strangest thing is that your beloved wife will sometimes put on the face of the adults.</p>
<h3>Feeling of Past and Present Recalling Autumn</h3>
<p>In the past, he said to his wife: "I want to go out. Take out a blue long gown." She was very obedient and walked silently to the closet in the back room and took it out. She opened the gown and waited for him to put his arms into the sleeves. Before he had even buttoned the buttons on his own, she had already bent down to button the buttons on the hem for him. He put on his hat and left. Just as he was about to walk out the door, he turned around and instructed her: "Cook lunch earlier today!" Saying that, he went out.</p>
<p>Now, she said to her husband: "I want to go out to see Miss Li! Take out that single coat!" He was very loyal and respectfully carried the box, found it from a big box at the bottom, opened the coat, and waited for her to put her arms into the sleeves. Before she had even buttoned her own buttons, he had already bowed his head and shined the patent leather shoes on her feet. She took her wallet and left. Just as she was about to walk out the door, she turned around and instructed him: "Come pick me up at the Yiyuan Dance Hall at two o'clock tonight!" Saying that, she went out.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>Chapter 11 Agreeing to Marriage with a Bowed Head, Yan Fang's Affectionate Concern, Joyful Soldiers, One time, I sent two bowls of food to his house, and my hand touched his. Afterwards, I always felt soft, warm, and indescribably good. I want to marry him as my daughter-in-law. On the night of the wedding, the first thing I would do is hold his hand and tell him in detail the joy in my heart. I think he must have lowered his head, pursed his lips, and just smiled. That demeanor, watching under a pair of big red candles, is so flavorful. He must be thinking proudly in his heart, and his hand wouldn't help but slap the bed. He himself slapped it for no reason, but it didn't matter. It startled Wang Shili, a newly enlisted sergeant, who took two steps back, thinking that the company commander was angry with him. Zhao Ziqiang saw a shadow flash at the door, not knowing who had come, and jumped up. Seeing the sergeant standing there, he smiled and said: I was just so happy that I slapped the bed, did I scare you! It doesn't matter, you can drink a few more glasses of my wedding wine in the future. What kind of banquet did you have when you married your wife? These few words were really inexplicable. Why did the company commander suddenly talk to him about getting married. However, since the company commander asked, he couldn't answer with silence, so he smiled and said: I don't have any family yet. Zhao Ziqiang shook his head: Don't delay, say one when you have the opportunity. I know you must be saying that you don't have any money on hand now. In fact, when you meet someone who is mutually agreeable, you don't need to spend any money. Besides, if you get engaged now, and then marry her later, it won't cost much money? Wang Shili thought to himself, where did Company Commander Zhao get this kind of experience to tell me. Moreover, no one has thought about getting married, why did he tell me this? But although he was suspicious in his heart, he didn't show it on the surface, and smiled at him: What Company Commander Zhao said is right, I'll trust you to tell me when you see someone suitable in the future. (132)</p>
<p>Columbus, exploring new lands, did not have the leisure of Liu Zihou composing poems and writing records. His only purpose was to discover new plants.</p>
<p>Sure enough, heaven answered his prayers. He found a strange plant and was so overjoyed that he laughed loudly</p>
<p>Saying: "Good treasure! Good treasure!" Before the laughter was over, two robbers suddenly jumped out of the forest, pointing their guns at Mr. Zhong and saying: "Hey! Quickly take out the treasure, or be careful of your head!" Mr. Zhong smiled and said: "You want a treasure? I respectfully offer it." As he said that, he opened the collection box, took out a handful of plants like firewood, and sent them to the robbers' hands. The robbers were stunned for a moment and fiercely forced Mr. Zhong to take out the treasure. Mr. Zhong smiled again and said: "These things, in my opinion, are more precious than gold; that's why I say they are treasures, but you don't see them as treasures." The robbers searched Mr. Zhong all over, but couldn't find any treasure after all, so they let out a whistle and left.</p>
<h3>The Face of the Adults Jun Ti</h3>
<p>There was a joke in the past: A county magistrate expressed his intention to resign to the prefect. The prefect asked him why? He said: "There are three ugly things that I really can't stand, so I'm quitting. These three ugly things: The first is the private parts of female corpses during autopsies: The second is the buttocks of prisoners during beatings: The third" When he said this (I have not seen it, I hereby solemnly declare)</p>
<p>I don't object to not being horizontal, but why should a good face be made uglier than a woman's private parts and buttocks? Moreover, why put this thing, which is uglier than a woman's private parts and buttocks, out for others to see?</p>
<h3>Little Toys for Children Chi Fo</h3>
<p>Little friends! You have all kinds of games at school, such as playing table tennis, kicking shuttlecock, jumping rope, playing ball, playing hide-and-seek, as well as bamboo work, woodworking, carving, clay painting, singing in your homework, all of which you find interesting. During the holidays, inviting a few younger brothers and sisters, flying kites, and having picnics, you also find very interesting. Doesn't the book say? There was a Tao Kan in the Jin Dynasty, who became a high official, and brought bamboo scraps and wood chips to his home, saying that these were useful things and he was unwilling to discard them. Later, when building ships, he used bamboo scraps as nails; when there was heavy snow, he used wood chips to pave the ground, saying that there is no waste in the world, it just depends on whether we can use it. Little friends, if you believe this story, you should also know that waste can be used. Now I will briefly list a few kinds of waste for little friends to make toys. I wonder if there are any better little toys? (1) Melon Seed Chicken: Take several melon seeds, crack open the pointed ends, and connect them to each other to create the body of a chicken. Use a melon seed connected to a bamboo shoot in the front as the chicken neck; embed a piece of melon seed flesh in front of the neck as the chicken head. Connect two melon seeds at the tail and raise them slightly. Then use two melon seeds, born on the left and right of the body, as wings. Wouldn't it be very interesting to make this little toy with jade hands?</p>
<p>(2) Fish Crane: Wash the head bone of a hairtail cleanly, and it can be inlaid to make a crane. The skull cap can be used as the crane's trunk; the butterfly-shaped bones of the gills can be inlaid to make wings; there are also several straight bones, two used as feet and one used as the head. Tie the end of the neck with red velvet thread to make the crane's head, and then pick a sharp small bone to make the crane's beak. Then, the entire crane is completed. Sew it with thread, and it is lifelike and very beautiful. Little friends, after you eat fish, you might as well try it!</p>
<p>(3) Orange Basket: Orange is a delicious fruit, rich in fruit acid. Eating it can help digestion, calm the liver, quench thirst, and produce saliva! Therefore, little friends might as well eat one or two after a meal, which is really beneficial and harmless. Little friends can also make oranges into flower baskets; use a small knife to divide the orange peel, and slowly turn the orange peel over, and it becomes a petite and exquisite flower basket.</p>
<p>(4) Sorghum Grasshopper: Use two sorghum stalks about one inch long and tie them tightly with thread; in the middle of one end of the thread, attach a short stalk, one end of which can be attached to the plaster part in the center of the sorghum stalk. Put it on the table, and it will jump, very much like a field grasshopper, very lively. When little friends want to make the grasshopper jump, they can attach the short stalk in the middle to the plaster part, and it will jump again.</p>

<h3>Matters Needing Attention for University Admissions Regarding the Joint Entrance Examinations of Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>There are three points (Nanjing Special Dispatch) This year, some provinces and cities have failed to hold secondary school graduation joint entrance examinations due to special circumstances. It is now learned from the Ministry of Education that secondary school graduates from all provinces and cities across the country, except for the following three points, will hold secondary school joint entrance examinations as usual. All universities should be aware of this when recruiting new students as a reference for assessing the qualifications of new students. (1) Provinces and cities approved to postpone the joint entrance examination this year (Hebei, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Beijing). (2) Secondary schools attached to universities, colleges, and vocational schools approved to be exempt from the joint entrance examination this year (Attached High School of National Tongji University, Attached High School of Hangzhou National School of Art, Attached High School of Private Nantong College). (3) The Shanghai joint entrance examination has not yet been completed. Graduating students from public and private secondary schools in the city are allowed to apply to various universities with certificates issued by the Shanghai Education Bureau. After being admitted, they must still return to the city to participate in supplementary examinations. Only after passing the supplementary examination are they allowed to enroll and attend classes. With the exception of the above three points, students from other provinces and cities applying to various universities must uniformly abide by the instructions of the Ministry of Education. Secondary school graduation certificates must be affixed with the graduation joint entrance examination qualification mark of the competent education administrative authority before they are allowed to register for the examination.</p>
<h3>New Jiangxi Education Director Cheng Qibao Announces Educational Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>(Nanchang, 16th) Education Director Cheng Qibao received reporters and reported on the educational policy guidelines. (1) Improve the quality of schools, promote physical education and music. (2) Stabilize the lives of teachers and ensure their status, and within three years, the provincial treasury will subsidize the development of local education.</p>
<h3>Approval Granted for Enrollment in Five Colleges of Pingda University</h3>
<p>Arts College and Nursing College Restored (Beiping, 16th) With the Pingda University reorganization order issued, the five colleges of Women's, Agriculture, Engineering, Medicine, and Law are allowed to recruit new students in Shanghai and Beijing. The Arts College and Nursing College have requested the restoration of sports, and have requested the Ministry of Education to withdraw its order. High school teachers, staff, and students are easing, hoping to end it gradually.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Approves Flexible Implementation of the National Language Promotion Plan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously ordered all bookstores across the country to assist in promoting the national language, as requested by the National National Language Education Promotion Association. (1) Stop printing publications that do not meet the standard national pronunciation. (2) Add phonetic symbols to new words and words with easily mispronounced pronunciations in elementary school textbooks. (3) Children's and popular reading materials should be edited in the national language and annotated with phonetic symbols. (4) All kinds of books, magazines, and printed matter must, at a minimum, add phonetic symbols to their titles. These orders were communicated to the education departments of various provinces and cities, and they were relayed to bookstores within their jurisdictions. From August 1st of this year, all elementary school textbooks, children's reading materials, popular reading materials, and various books and magazines printed must be handled in accordance with the regulations. Publications that do not meet the standard national pronunciation should be discontinued. Subsequently, the Shanghai Education Bureau submitted a report from Lu Feibohong, chairman of the Shanghai Booksellers Association, stating that after receiving the order, they convened a meeting of members, who studied it in detail. It was generally agreed that the first and second items had already been implemented. For the third item, children's and popular reading materials should be edited in the national language and annotated with phonetic symbols. The association believes that it should be implemented in accordance with the regulations to use the national language. The annotation of phonetic symbols can be left to the editor's discretion and should not be enforced uniformly. They believe that phonetic notation for every word not only takes up space and increases prices, but also, for those who already know phonetic symbols, reading according to the pronunciation will lose the effect of practicing literacy. For those who have not learned phonetic symbols, it is even more useless, only increasing the cost of books for readers. Moreover, there are many kinds of small phonetic dictionaries published in the market. Unknown words can be checked in dictionaries, and there is no need to annotate phonetic symbols for known words. For the fourth item, various books and magazines and other printed matter must, at a minimum, add phonetic symbols to their titles. The association believes that children's and popular reading materials can be handled accordingly, while other specialized translations, reprinted ancient books, and art books, etc., should be free to add phonetic symbols or not, and should not be forced, as this would cause practical difficulties. The Ministry of Education has instructed the Shanghai Education Bureau to temporarily allow this to be followed. You should immediately be informed and instructed to comply.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Secondary School Graduation Examination</h3>
<p>The examination was completed on the 10th and 11th of this month. The Examination Committee will take two weeks to review the papers. The Guangdong Province Secondary School Graduation Examination was held on the 10th and 11th of this month. The Provincial Department of Education prepared everything beforehand. For convenience, collection points were set up in suitable locations in each county. Apart from Guangzhou city, seven collection points were set up in Heyuan, Guangzhou Bay, Shantou, Meixian, Qujiang, Beihai, and Haikou. Examination papers from nearby counties and cities were submitted to these collection points within a specified time. Examination papers from other counties and cities were submitted directly to the Provincial Department of Education. For the sake of prudence, the Department of Education had previously dispatched several supervisors, secretaries, and section chiefs to various eastern, western, southern, and northern districts to oversee the examination affairs in each county and city. In Guangzhou city, more than 3,500 high school and junior high school students from provincial schools participated in the examination. The First Middle School was designated as the first examination venue, Jiaozhong Middle School as the second, Guangzhou Court as the third, and the Provincial Girls' Middle School as the fourth. During the examination, junior high school students were assigned to the first and second venues, general high school students to the third, and teacher training high school students to the fourth. The seating arrangement was orderly. The graduation examinations for municipal middle schools in Guangzhou city were also held at the same time. More than 690 high school and junior high school students from municipal middle schools participated in the examination. The examination venue was the Municipal Normal School, with a total of fifteen classrooms. On the morning of the 10th of this month, the students arrived at the venue and took the examination according to their assigned seats. The Director of the Department of Education, the Director of the Bureau of Education, and other staff members inspected the venue separately, and the atmosphere was very solemn. The secondary school graduation examination in the province on the first day (i.e., the 10th) was divided into three sessions. The first session was from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, and the subject was Party Principles. The second session was from 10:05 AM to 12:05 PM, and the subject was Arithmetic. The third session was from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and the subject was Chinese. On the second day (i.e., the 11th), the fourth session continued at 8:00 AM. Junior high school and general high school students took English or German, and teacher training high school students took Introduction to Education. The fifth session was from 10:05 AM to 12:05 PM. Junior high school students took Natural History, and general high school and teacher training high school students took Biology. The sixth session was from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Junior high school students took Physics and Chemistry, and high school students took Physics and Chemistry or History and Geography. Teacher training high school students took Teaching Methods. The seventh session was from 3:05 PM to 5:05 PM. Junior high school students took History and Geography, and teacher training high school students took Elementary School Administration. At 5:05 PM, all papers were collected, and the secondary school graduation examination in the province ended simultaneously. The subjects, questions, and timing of the examinations in each county examination area were consistent with those in Guangzhou city, and will not be repeated. Once the examination papers from each county and city are received, the Graduation Examination Committee established by the Department of Education will immediately begin the review process. After the review, the scores of each subject will be calculated. After the matter is completed, another meeting will be held to determine the passing standards. It will take about two weeks to complete. The names of those who pass the examination will not be announced until two weeks later. (Evening of July 11th)</p>

<h3>The White Goose Summer Painting Class Begins</h3>
<p>The White Goose Painting Tutoring School, which has been approved and registered by the Municipal Bureau of Education, has completed the practical art crash course that was offered last semester. A total of eleven students have passed and have been granted graduation, and certificates have been issued by the Municipal Bureau of Education. It is also learned that most of the graduates of the class have considerable positions in society. The summer tutoring class, which started on the 10th of this month, has attracted dozens of applicants. They all believe that the school is located in a quiet building at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Avenue Road, and that the teaching is carefully guided by Fang Xuegu and Pan Sitong, which makes the progress of art very rapid. The tuition is also low, which is a good opportunity for those who are economically and time-constrained and have a passion for art.</p>
<h3>Yang Hu Talks About the Founding of Zhaohe Middle School</h3>
<p>Zhaohe Middle School, located at 476 Haig Road in this city, has attracted much attention from the public since the news of its establishment and its enrollment notice were disclosed in various newspapers. Dozens of people from this city and other places have been going to inquire about the regulations or inquire about the content and register every day. In order to understand the origin of the school, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specially visited Yang Hu, the director of the Security Office who is responsible for preparing for the school, a few days ago and asked about the founding process. According to Mr. Yang, the Zhaohe Uprising in the fourth year of the Republic of China has a glorious position in the history of the revolution and has been deeply known by the Chinese people. However, it still lacks commemoration, and the historical achievements are easily forgotten. Therefore, I obtained the support of the central government and comrades from all over the country last winter and planned to establish a school in order to inherit the legacy of the ancestors and cultivate talents. Moreover, because I personally experienced this battle and was in Shanghai, I charged myself and Comrade Jia Botao to jointly prepare for it. Since Mr. Yang and Comrade Jia were entrusted by the teachers, they immediately proceeded actively. Moreover, the Zhaohe Uprising was originally in Shanghai, so it was decided to set up the school site in Shanghai. In the future, the plan to expand will require building a new school building, and they are all proceeding separately, vowing to devote their full energy to cultivating talents for the country. The internal organization and educational policy of the school are all in accordance with the latest trends, and the fees are particularly low. Moreover, the descendants of revolutionary ancestors are especially favored, and there are separate regulations for the methods.</p>
<h3>Zhengfeng Middle School Moves to a New Location</h3>
<p>In this year's graduation examination, 90% of the students who participated in the graduation examination from Zhengfeng Middle School in this city passed all subjects completely. Because the original high school and junior high school buildings on Gordon Road and Seymour Road were close to the market and not suitable for teaching, the school moved to Building 204, Yaozhujiao Road, French Concession (the temporary school building of the former Shanghai Law School) on July 1st. The new site has spacious houses and a quiet location. The school has a sports field and a campus, which are suitable for young people to study and relax. Students from this city and other places have been going to register very enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>Bingxun Chinese Stenography Branch Opens</h3>
<p>The Bingxun Chinese Stenography First Branch, located at 552 Continental Commercial Center, opened a few days ago. There are many students, including student court clerks, newspaper reporters, and store employees. The inventor, Yang Bingxun, personally teaches the new method and uses a phonograph to teach Chinese pronunciation. Scholars are satisfied. It is said that there are still vacancies. Those who are interested in this new skill for a living can go directly to the headquarters of Gao'an Lane, Haining Road to register for admission.</p>
<h3>Teachers and Students of the School of Commerce Welcome Xu Back to School</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Peikun of the National Shanghai School of Commerce was summoned to Nanjing by Minister Wang a month ago to report on the situation. After returning to Shanghai, he expressed his negativity. The teachers and students believed that Xu had been working for many years and had achieved remarkable results, and they could not bear to see him leave. They sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education to persuade him to stay. On the student side, since Xu left the school, the school has been virtually suspended, so they jointly formed a joint name with all the professors to send a telegram to the Ministry of Education to urge Xu to return to the school to preside over the work, and sent representatives to sincerely persuade him to stay, asking Xu to return to the school to preside over the work immediately.</p>

<h3>Davis Cup European Zone Completed, England Won 3-2 Against Australia</h3>
<p>Crawford Won Against Lee in the Last Game (Havas News Agency, London, 15th) In the Davis Cup European Zone final between England and Australia, England has eliminated Australia, as reported in yesterday's telegram. The outcome of the last singles match today was irrelevant. Originally, the match was scheduled to be between England's Punnett and Australia's Crawford, but Punnett was suffering from shoulder pain, so Lee was temporarily replaced. Crawford defeated Lee with a score of 8-6, 7-5, 6-4.</p>
<h3>France Proposes to Abolish the New Davis Cup System</h3>
<p>A meeting will be called to discuss the matter and stop the implementation this year. (Amsterdam, 14th, Reuters) The French Lawn Tennis Association issued a notice today, calling on the countries participating in the Davis Cup to meet on July 22 to discuss whether the new Davis Cup competition system can be abolished and the play-off matches in August and September can be stopped.</p>
<p>Contents of the New System: This new system was decided by the International Lawn Tennis Association last year and will be implemented starting this year. The content of the new system is that only the four countries that have won the right to the semi-finals in one zone can participate in next year's competition. Those who are eliminated before the semi-finals will hold another play-off match. The four countries that finally win the right to the semi-finals in the play-off match and the four countries that have won the right to the semi-finals in this year's championship can participate in next year's competition. For example, if Japan does not participate in one year, it will have to wait until the following year to participate.</p>
<h3>Japan Proposes Fundamental Reform of the Far Eastern Games Championship System to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Change the championship competition of China, Japan, and the Philippines into a championship competition for each type of competition (three other proposals)</p>
<p>(1) Ball games will be judged by a third country (2) Postpone the conference date to before October (3) Invite the Puppet Manchuria to participate in next year's conference The 10th Far Eastern Games, which will be held in Manila, Philippines from May 12th to 19th next year, has already been invited by the Philippines to China to participate. Recently, Kishida Kiyoi, chairman of the Japanese Sports Association, sent a letter to Vargas, acting chairman of the Far Eastern Games Competition Committee of the Philippines, making four important proposals: (1) Inviting the Puppet Manchuria to participate is currently being seriously discussed by the Philippines. (2) Postponing the conference date to before October This item has been rejected by the Philippines. The following is a translated excerpt from Kishida Kiyoi's original letter:</p>
<h3>Hebei Women's Softball Team (Photo by Chen Jiazhen)</h3>
<p>(1) Please invite neutral referees Mr. Fajagas, acting chairman of the 10th Far Eastern Games Competition Committee, as a result of several discussions by this association, we hereby propose the following: (1) Basketball, volleyball, baseball, and other games should be designated by neutral referees from a third country to perform. If China is against Japan, please ask your country's referees to take the lead. This article has been submitted for discussion at the last conference, but no resolution has been made. This proposal is eagerly implemented in Japan. In the track and field referees, Japan should also have the corresponding number of agreements. This was implemented in Tokyo last time, and the same is true for sea swimming.</p>
<p>(2) Postpone the Conference Date</p>
<p>Due to the inconvenience of student athletes among Japanese athletes, we request that the conference date be changed and re-discussed and decided. If possible, the later the date is changed, the better, but it must be before October. It rains a lot in your country in August, so it is best not to hold it during the rainy season.</p>
<p>(3) Change the Championship System</p>
<p>The nature of the Far Eastern Games is a branch of the World Olympic Games, and in the past history, there have often been unfortunate impulses between the two countries. Japan proposes to fundamentally change the championship system of the Far Eastern Games and change the championship competition of the three countries into a championship competition for each sport. This can avoid unfortunate incidents and track the Olympics.</p>
<p>(4) Invite Puppet Manchuria to Participate</p>
<p>Regarding the invitation of Puppet Manchuria to participate, a telegram has been sent to you. Please use the power of the Competition Committee to invite Puppet Manchuria to participate, just as Japan invited India to participate last time. This is not to change the organization of the conference, as it does not immediately give Manchuria the status of a member. (Omitted below) Kishida Kiyoi</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of the North China Games</h3>
<p>(Qingdao Correspondence) The 17th North China Games, the results of this conference have greatly improved compared to the previous session. A total of eight national records and twelve North China records were broken, which is a highlight for the sports world. With this gradual progress, it may not be difficult to occupy a position in the Far East or the World Games in the future. In addition, there are many things worth mentioning about the various aspects of the conference in these four days. Now I will record them in a miscellaneous way as follows:</p>
<h3>Hot Weather, Ten Thousand Fans Waving Together</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the conference, the weather has been unusually hot, which has never been seen in Qingdao. However, the number of spectators has not decreased due to this. Every day, there are always more than 10,000 visitors. Needless to say, the athletes and conference staff are sweating profusely, and the spectators are all doing Anti-Japanese War (Note: Anti-Japanese War is also light) and are also sweating. So, the spectators waved thousands of fans together. From a distance, it looks like thousands of butterflies are flying, which is good-looking. Most women hold umbrellas to block the sun, and the colors of the umbrellas are green, blue, black, and white, mixed among the thousands of fans, just like hundreds of big peng birds spreading their wings and dancing their claws, competing with thousands of butterflies for dominance. It is a spectacle.</p>
<h3>Zhu Tianzhen from Shandong Wins First Place in Women's Track and Field at the North China Games</h3>
<h3>A Group of Flies Flew to Qingdao</h3>
<p>At noon on the 13th, Mayor Shen Honglie specially hosted a banquet at the Yingbin Hall (Mayor's official residence) to entertain reporters from this city and other places. During the banquet, Shen delivered a welcoming speech and recounted the naval mutiny and the general situation of Qingdao's construction. The speech lasted for two hours. It can be said that Shen is a good talker. After Shen's speech, the public recommended Wu Qiu, a reporter from the Tianjin Yishi Daily, to deliver a reply. In Wu's reply, there was a passage saying that reporters are like flies, and most politicians do not want to see them. Seeing them makes them headache and they can't wait to wave them away. Now a group of flies has flown to Qingdao. Mayor Shen not only does not take fly swatters to swat us, but also lays down many sugar cane to feast on us. We are really flattered. The saying goes that mosquitoes gather into thunder. There are many of us reporters, and the sound of our words can also gather into thunder. Since we have the responsibility of propaganda, we will publicize the results of this conference and Mayor Shen's achievements in governing Qingdao, which will definitely be a hit and make the whole country hear about it. It was full of humor, and the crowd applauded.</p>
<h3>Beijing Women's Volleyball Team</h3>
<h3>Twelve Children Lift Iron Hammers</h3>
<p>During the special skills performance of Chinese martial arts, each performer had exquisite skills. For example, Wang Xinzhi from Shandong climbed up the pole upside down, like an ape, light and agile, and made various postures. The audience cheered. Rong Saikun and Ma Qinghe from Shandong performed the breaking of giant stones with their backs. The stone weighed about 200 pounds. Rong used his abdomen to bear the stone, and used a hammer to hit it hard. The stone was broken, but the person was not injured. Yang Mingzhai from Qingdao performed the bench bridge. His head and feet were pillowed with benches, and his body was suspended in mid-air. A stone weighing more than 200 pounds was pressed on his stomach, and he used an iron hammer to strike it hard. The stone was broken into two pieces, and Yang's body was still suspended in mid-air, with a calm expression. Wu Wanyun and Chen Zongbin from Beijing performed the golden spear locking the throat. The barrel of the gun was bent, but the throat was not injured. Other performances such as Wu Yuhua and Yu Xiulan's double-sword entry, and Yan Chengwen and Dong Yuxiang's unarmed gun snatching were also very exciting. The most amazing thing was Liu Tiansu, a child from Henan, who was only twelve years old, and was able to lift the 48-pound iron hammer several times without changing his face, winning thunderous applause from the audience.</p>
<h3>Eighty-Year-Old Man Performs on the Field</h3>
<p>This morning, Qingdao martial artists performed, divided into three groups: an elderly group, a children's group, and a women's group. In the elderly group, Zhang Keqin was the oldest at eighty years old, followed by Hao Qinggui at seventy years old, and Qi Qihai at sixty years old and Zhang Penghai at sixty-nine years old. When the four old men performed, they were all energetic and no less than young people. For example, Hao's Eight Immortals Drunken Knife, Qi's Bagua Spear, Zhang Keqin's Cross-Splitting Stick, and Zhang Penghai's Liuhe Spear all won applause from the audience. In the children's group, Zhong Yanwen was the youngest at only seven years old. The others, such as Gao Yuqing, Longquan, Wu Hengqing, Meng Xianlu, Ma Xuede, Zhang Jiong, and Gao Xushi, were all no more than twelve or thirteen years old and were also worth watching. There were a total of five people in the women's group: Zhang Wenqing, Jiang Ailan, Zhong Lanying, Qi Xiulan, and Yue Xiuyun, all around fifteen years old. Zhang's single knife, Zhong's Shaolin sword, Jiang's Taiji sword, and Qi's double knives were all very well-founded and did not look like weak women. Especially Yue's hand-guard double hooks were outstanding. Finally, Qi Qihai and Qi Xiulan, father and daughter, fought against Wu Hengqing and Zhang Jiong to snatch the gun with their bare hands, which was also rare.</p>
<h3>Triangular Tennis Match, South Africa First</h3>

<h3>Meilu Wins Against Feili 9-6</h3>
<p>The Hu family of Meilu made their first real battle yesterday. Unfortunately, Hu Qifeng was ill and could not cooperate with Hu Qizhuo, who came to fight in the first doubles match, which led to the collapse of the entire line and a great reduction in strength.

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Medicine and Pharmacy in the Past Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Administration of Medicine and Pharmacy</p>
<p>Section 3: Recent Government Orders</p>
<p>(Note) In the previous issue, the table was not properly typeset due to hasty formatting, and the items were unclear. Misunderstandings may be unavoidable. There is no way to correct it for the time being, and it will be corrected in a separate publication in the future.</p>
<p>Medical and pharmaceutical decrees are, in principle, a matter for the whole country, not just a corner of Shanghai. However, in the preface to this article, I have already stated that Shanghai is the center of medicine and pharmacy, and the complex and fragmented situation is even more pronounced in Shanghai. Therefore, I will focus on the decrees affecting Shanghai to represent the rest. The first time there was a decree to regulate medicine and pharmacy in Shanghai was during the era of the Shanghai Commercial Port Superintendent in the 15th year of the Republic (1926). In November of that year, Liu Sirong of the Shanghai Commercial Port Police Department, together with Hu Hongji, the Director of the Health Bureau, jointly registered doctors once. It seemed to start with new doctors, taking the Beijing government's established case as a model. Because at that time, the Beijing Ministry of Internal Affairs' Health Department issued licenses only to prove a doctor's qualifications, and to practice in Beijing, it was still necessary to obtain permission from the Police Department. Therefore, the Director of the Songhu Commercial Port and the Second Police Bureau jointly issued licenses. However, before much progress was made, the political situation suddenly changed, and the Health Bureau was interrupted. In June of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), it was already the era of the National Revolutionary Army. I remember that Mr. Hu Hongji came to lead the Municipal Health Bureau again and re-registered doctors, with a completely new look. Although they could not hold an examination, they had to review diplomas, which shows that the authorities at that time gradually paid attention to the complicated situation. There was a "Physician Practice Examination Committee," which was organized by professors from various medical schools in the city hired by the Health Bureau. Each school sent two or three people, or one or two people. I remember that Le Wenzhao, Gao Jinglang, Tang Lizhou, Chen Zhuoren, Song Guobin, Xia Shenchu, Wang Jingyang, You Pengxi and others were on the committee. It was called an examination, but in fact, it was just reviewing diplomas according to the standard set by the Health Bureau for graduates of schools with four or more years of study. However, there were two very difficult problems to solve. First, all the so-called schools claimed to have four years of study, which was impossible to prove. Second, all hospitals claimed to have affiliated medical schools, which was impossible to refute. The Health Bureau handed over the difficult problems to the committee members, who did not have thorough methods, which led to many jokes and a halt midway. There was a Western doctor who was a disciple of the trainees at the Shanghai Hospital during the time when Li Pingshu entrusted Zhang Zhujun to run it. He could be called a second-generation disciple of the Shanghai Hospital. He tried every possible means to get a diploma early, and he was afraid that the diploma would not be valuable. So, he had a novel idea and asked Mr. Li Pingshu, the founder of Shanghai Hospital, to appraise the diploma. Old Mr. Li was also very clever. He took up his pen and wrote on the side of the diploma: "Li Zhongjue respectfully viewed on such and such day." This old man simply took out the handwriting of Wanzi Hua from the Pingquan Study to deal with him, which can be considered extremely humorous. In addition, because those who were not from schools were rejected after being reviewed, they simply ran to the doors of the committee members every day, either asking to open the door for bribes, or even making threatening remarks. As a result, the committee members could not stand this kind of abuse and intimidation, so they stopped working. Fortunately, Nanjing was setting up the Ministry of Health there, and we, the common people, hoped that the central government would be established, all policies would be implemented, and there would be fair laws. Why should there be so much controversy? As for the old doctors, they also registered that year. At that time, the Director of the Health Bureau himself was a new doctor, and he handed over the power to the famous old doctors of Chinese medicine to handle it. Later, they simply ended up holding examinations every year, and everyone passed. The Director was still criticized by many people in the new medical community. Since the Xinhai Revolution, our country's people first misunderstood equality, and after the establishment of the National Government, there was another wave of misunderstanding freedom. No matter which sector of the people, they "did not know their place" and "did not ask right from wrong," insisted on fighting for position, and insisted on gaining without labor. As a result, all policies were obstructed. How could the medical and pharmaceutical community be the only exception?</p>
<h3>Discussion on Cun Kou Pulse Diagnosis (5)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>(11) It is absolutely impossible for the pulses of the three parts of the cun kou to be uniquely slow or uniquely fast.</p>
<p>The pulses of the three parts of the cun kou are only one pulse, only one of the hundreds of arterial branches. Its pulsation is only the influence of the heartbeat. As has been explained clearly above, people with secondary education or above should also understand it clearly. From this, it can be known that if it does not move, then it is finished. If it starts to move, of course, all three parts will move together. There will never be a situation where the cun moves but the guan does not move, or the guan moves but the chi does not move. In other words, there will never be a situation where the cun moves once, the guan moves twice, the guan moves once, and the chi moves twice. In theory, it should not be uniquely large or uniquely small, uniquely sunken or uniquely floating either. Because the heart only releases one kind of pressure when it beats, which affects the blood flow. However, the structure of the blood vessels themselves is different everywhere. Some places are thick, and some places are thin. Therefore, it is possible for it to be uniquely large or uniquely small. The position of the blood vessels is also different everywhere. Some are shallow and under the skin, and some are deep in the muscles. Therefore, it is also possible for it to be uniquely sunken or uniquely floating. Even so, it is only a matter of the different structure and location of the blood vessels. It is not a communication report of any zang-qi phenomenon. As for the speed, it is either all slow or all fast. There will never be a situation where the cun pulse is uniquely slow and the chi pulse is uniquely fast. If it is said that there is a uniquely slow or uniquely fast pulse, it is a lie, it is deceiving people, it is fraudulent behavior. However, the "Sanbu Jiuhou" chapter in the Su Wen book, which is revered by Chinese medicine as the supreme law, says: "A uniquely rapid pulse is a disease, and a uniquely slow pulse is a disease." Xu Xueshi's case of typhoid fever in Ben Shi Fang says: "The chi below is slow and weak." Lü Yuanzhen's diagnosis of Zhang Enxuan's case says: "The guan and chi are rapid and hollow." Xue Lizhai's diagnosis of Gu Feizhai's case says: "The liver, spleen, and kidney pulses are strong, large, and rapid." These are all evidence of lying, deceiving people, and fraudulent behavior. In the pulse records of Chinese medicine practitioners today, there are often such words. You can find them and investigate them thoroughly. Ask the Chinese medicine practitioners who have prescribed such uniquely slow or uniquely fast prescriptions.</p>
<p>(12) What is the reason why the pulse is sometimes reliable and sometimes unreliable?</p>
<p>In short, the pulse is the pulsation of the blood vessels, and it is the influence of the heartbeat. Therefore, by taking the pulse, you can know the strength of the heart, you can know whether the heartbeat is regular or irregular, you can know whether the heartbeat has pauses, you can know whether the blood vessels are hardened, and you can know the blood pressure. These are a few things that can be measured by taking the pulse. Therefore, in Chinese medicine, apart from the blind, the mind-dead, and those who live in a drunken stupor until death and advocate that "differentiating and examining the organs based on pulse location is definitely reliable" - these general fools - there are still many people who say that "the pulse diagnosis is sometimes reliable and sometimes unreliable." The people who make this kind of grey statement are probably those who diagnose the heart and blood vessel problems, and they feel that the internal and external correspond to each other, and that it is indeed valuable to detect the disease. However, people who diagnose other kinds of problems find that the disease and the pulse are completely inconsistent. Therefore, they say that it is sometimes reliable and sometimes unreliable. However, they suffer from a lack of analytical intelligence. They do not know that what is reliable is the disease of the heart and blood vessels, and what is unreliable is the nonsense of differentiating and examining the organs based on pulse location. They mistakenly believe that the entire pulse is sometimes reliable and sometimes unreliable. Therefore, they do not dare to do anything about it. They can only pay attention to the ancient saying, "Rely on the disease, not the pulse; rely on the pulse, not the disease." Alas! The absurdity of differentiating and examining the organs based on pulse location is not my personal opinion, nor is it my original opinion. The ancients have also said it. Let me quote a few people's words to show everyone: Li Shizhen said: "I often see contemporary doctors pressing and pressing on the six parts of both hands, saying that such and such a zang-fu organ is like this, and such and such a zang-fu organ is like that, as if the zang-fu organs are located between the two hands and can be felt by touching them. All kinds of ugly acts of deceiving people are actually self-deception." Xu Lingtai said: "There are tens of thousands of names of diseases, but the pulse images are only a few dozen kinds. Moreover, one disease can manifest in any of the dozens of kinds of pulses. How can one diagnose the pulse and immediately know what the disease is? This is all speculation that occasionally hits the mark and is used to deceive people." Chen Xiuyuan said: "Contemporary doctors open their mouths and always talk about the pulse image (gentlemen of the Chinese Medicine Regulations, please prick up your ears and listen). Then you know that they are used to deceiving people with small tricks, and their knowledge must be shallow. The more detailed the medical books discuss the pulse, the harder it is for the reader to understand them. They generally do not want to tell the truth." These three people should be considered great doctors of modern times, and they are also people who study knowledge. They have already spoken so frankly at that time. If they were born in modern times and knew the truth of science and the falseness of metaphysics, they would definitely speak frankly and speak even more thoroughly.</p>
<p>(13) Conclusion</p>
<p>According to what is said above, the pulse studies of old medicine are completely unreliable, completely fabricated, completely lying, and completely fraudulent behavior. Chinese people with secondary education or above should understand it thoroughly. The clear-headed people in the National Medical Center who advocate using scientific methods should also understand it thoroughly. Knowing your mistakes and correcting them is the key to being a person and also the way to study. Refusing to repent is never going to make progress. If the Chinese people have a true understanding, they must overthrow this fraudulent behavior that has been going on for two thousand years. If the Chinese medicine practitioners have a true awakening, they must abolish this fraudulent behavior that has been going on for two thousand years. If the National Medical Center has a true sincerity to adopt scientific methods, it must inform all Chinese medicine practitioners across the country to prohibit this fraudulent behavior that has been going on for two thousand years. This is the only way to be a pragmatic Chinese citizen. If you muddle through, I'm sorry, not only Chinese medicine, but our precious China, which is losing land at a rate of a hundred miles a day, is bound to perish. (End)</p>
<h3>"New Interpretation of Paralysis, Tuberculosis, Bloating, and Diaphragmatic Obstruction (5)"</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(4) Finally, I want to mention tuberculosis, a disease that ordinary people turn pale at the mention of. There are more patients with this disease than with any other disease, and those who are not treated account for one-seventh of the total human mortality rate, and even more in industrial areas or densely populated cities. Among these patients, the most common, of course, is pulmonary tuberculosis (pulmonary tuberculosis)! It accounts for almost 90% of all tuberculosis cases, but the tuberculosis bacteria can attack almost any part of the body. Other cases, such as laryngeal tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis, are also common, and there is a certain causal relationship with pulmonary tuberculosis. Acute infectious diseases, such as systemic miliary tuberculosis, are caused by tuberculosis bacteria entering the circulatory system. These are all important diseases in internal medicine. In surgery, there are skin tuberculosis, subcutaneous tissue tuberculosis, muscle tuberculosis, mucous membrane tuberculosis, lymphatic gland tuberculosis, bone tuberculosis, joint tuberculosis, tendon and mucous sac tuberculosis. Among these, diseases such as lupus vulgaris, gland disease, coxitis, and turtle bones are all very important. As for the internal organs, the pleura and peritoneum are most likely to be invaded. In addition, there are many obvious examples of kidney, urinary organs, mammary gland, thyroid gland, spleen, and liver. If you want to understand each type clearly, it is definitely not possible in the length of this article. Therefore, the classification of tuberculosis is very difficult in many places. Pathological anatomy is certainly different from clinical practice. It can also be classified according to its nature or the part it invades. Just take pulmonary tuberculosis as an example. There are already several types, such as caseous pneumonia, caseous tracheobronchial pneumonia, and galloping phthisis. According to the situation of the lesion spreading, it is divided into stages one, two, and three. In addition, there are closed and open pulmonary tuberculosis. The overall tuberculosis is certainly more complicated and cannot be exhausted in this article!</p>
<p>Regarding the transmission route of tuberculosis, most of it is inhaled with the air at the same time. This is called droplet transmission. Almost everyone knows this situation. There are also many cases of infection due to food. The most obvious example is milk. Many children develop intestinal tuberculosis directly from drinking it. In addition, there are also many examples of skin damage, oral contact, and genital infection of this disease through sexual intercourse. However, the question of whether tuberculosis bacteria are transmitted to the fetus through the placenta is still a question mark. People with narrow faces, long necks, narrow chests,</p>

<p>and deeply sunken supraclavicular fossae are most susceptible to tuberculosis. This is called the tuberculous constitution. In addition, congenital pulmonary artery stenosis, congested lungs, and other abnormalities can all be predisposing factors for the occurrence of this disease.</p>
<p>The course of tuberculosis is mostly chronic, except for a small number of cases. Regarding its main symptoms, such as hemoptysis, night sweats, poor appetite, consumption, and fever, many people know about them, and recently there have been relatively more popular texts of this kind. To save space, this article will not repeat them!</p>
<p>Regarding the latest treatment for tuberculosis, we certainly cannot say that there is already a specialized and effective method, but some parts can indeed satisfy patients. Artificial pneumothorax and Threukotonie surgery are very effective for unilateral pulmonary tuberculosis. Long-term treatment with iron tebogulin and agents such as calcium silicate can also be very helpful for local and overall symptoms. The symptomatic treatment for various symptoms is also much more complete than before! I think it's better than eating placentas or other meaningless prescriptions, right?</p>
<p>The question of whether tuberculosis can be completely cured can be answered in two aspects. It is impossible for the lesions of pulmonary tuberculosis to be completely cured and the lungs to be the same as healthy lungs. However, there is great hope for the relief of all the patient's suffering and the restoration of the body's nutrition to its original state. In other words, the state that ordinary people consider to be completely cured. As for whether it recurs, it only depends entirely on how the patient takes care of himself and the standards he follows. Among these, galloping phthisis, caseous pneumonia, systemic miliary tuberculosis, and surgery for turtle back coxitis and other diseases have relatively little hope. These are a few exceptions.

<h3>Two Major Points in Medical Education</h3>
<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>Medical science is a specialized discipline. Students begin to study as soon as they enter the school gate. From then on, their entire life process is almost entirely devoted to research. Therefore, it is impossible to be competent without a firm will and a strong physique. First of all, let's talk about the basic courses, such as anatomy, physiology, pathology, bacteriology, pharmacology, biology, and chemistry. In addition to lectures and demonstrations, each subject requires experimental work, which often continues day and night. It is also necessary to record the results and compare them with the textbooks. If the textbooks are insufficient, they are supplemented by magazines and other reference books. Often, the precedents of predecessors are overturned unintentionally. It is not enough to distinguish right from wrong without extensive research. Various experiments often take the whole day to complete, but still cannot get an overview. The hard work is like this. As for clinical work, it is also extremely heavy. All subjects are extremely complex. Outpatient clinics and wards are all places for practice. As soon as a patient enters the hospital, their medical history must be recorded, and a physical examination must be performed. Even stool, blood, and sputum must be tested one by one to find the source of the disease. After the clinical period is over, they become interns. All kinds of diagnosis and treatment work must be studied together with professors and lecturers. They even sleep and eat there, without rest. They are in a hurry and have no time to relax. After graduation, they open a practice and enter the world. It is often difficult to predict the time of house calls. They brave the wind and rain, regardless of the cold and heat. The work of obstetricians is the most difficult to regulate. In the middle of the day and night, in the cold and heat, they respond quickly to an invitation. The busy schedule is like that. Even if they do not want to open a practice, or become teachers, or specialize in research, their work is not reduced at all. Often, they cannot complete a problem until they abandon sleep and food. I have personally experienced this kind of situation. In the past, the German Earlich studied the special drug for syphilis. He tried again and again and was not satisfied. He tried hundreds of times and still did not succeed. His sincerity accumulated, and his determination opened the way for success. Finally, the amazing discovery was a success. His determined spirit of research is worthy of our emulation. Even in our country, the medical and pharmaceutical scholars of the past, such as Li Shizhen, began compiling the Compendium of Materia Medica in the 21st year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty and completed it in the 6th year of Wanli. It took 26 years. The magnificent work of 52 volumes can still be verified today. In general, medical scholars, whether they are scholars, doctors, research experts, or even writers, their hard and laborious work is undeniable. This hard and laborious work cannot be accomplished solely by relying on a firm will. It must have a strong physique to be able to see it through from beginning to end and achieve its goal. However, to achieve this goal, the students themselves and the school authorities must share the responsibility. Students should, in their spare time, invigorate their spirits and forge their physique as their own responsibility. The medical school authorities must be extra careful about the students' physique. According to my experience in running a school, some students often have to take a break for a certain period of time due to physical problems after studying for one or two years. Some even have to drop out of school. Some also abandon their business after graduation because they cannot handle the physical burden. If this is the case, not only will the individual suffer, but the country and society will also suffer great losses. It is found that the most common and most destructive disease to young people in our country is pulmonary disease. The cause of death of the people across the country is also overwhelmingly pulmonary tuberculosis. According to recent statistics, 25% of the diseases in our country are pulmonary tuberculosis, which is more than three times that of European and American countries. As far as I know, there are not a few medical school students who abandon their studies because of pulmonary tuberculosis. To correct the shortcomings, the medical school authorities should make a thorough physical examination of students when they enter the pre-medical and undergraduate programs. If there are any shortcomings, they should be advised to seek medical treatment before they can enter the school. After entering the school, they should also be examined every year. This kind of examination work cannot be handled by hiring a medical consultant. A complete health department must be organized to specialize in this matter, guide students on hygiene habits, and ways to forge their physique. They will be diagnosed and treated when they are sick so that they can recover. Special attention should be paid to the lungs. It is best to take X-rays for diagnosis and compile statistics for assessment. The above is about physique. In addition, moral cultivation is also very important. Because doctors are engaged in service, their nature is originally to serve society, not like merchants who are interested in profit. In terms of the meaning of the word, the English word Profession has two meanings: Pro means "before" and Feseion means "confess." It means that when studying medicine, you should first confess to serving society, just like government officials taking an oath. It is not about appearances. There are about three types of so-called Profession: 1. Pastors, who promote personality. 2. Lawyers, who protect human rights. 3. Doctors, who protect life. Although their paths are different, they all serve society. In addition, all occupations that seek to earn a living and profit cannot be called "Pro Feseion." Since doctors are serving society when they open a practice, there will naturally be compensation for their service. The problem of livelihood should not be a concern. There are many ways to seek promotion and wealth. Please do not be a mere figurehead in the medical field. Therefore, what doctors should pay attention to is the patient first, the colleagues second, and themselves last. They should have a spirit of sacrifice everywhere and a great ambition to serve everywhere. It is appropriate to treat people with compassion and work hard to encourage themselves. In the past, Dr. Lazeare, in order to study yellow fever, did not care about his own body and used himself as a tool for experimentation. He used mosquito bites and blood to seek results and eventually died of poisoning. His research was not completed, and his coffin was attached to his body. His encounter is truly sad, but his courageous and vigorous spirit of sacrifice is enough to be remembered for generations. On the other hand, if a doctor seeks profit by unethical behavior, his crime is actually greater than that of robbers, because robbers injure people openly, and everyone knows how to avoid them, while quack doctors practice killing in the name of charity. In the end, they specialize in treating prostitutes and flower willows, prescribing drugs for abortion, and have no scruples. The killing is more terrible than that of the tiger in the market. Thinking of this, I cannot help but shudder. Moreover, robbers injure people only for economic purposes, while quack doctors harm their lives in addition to money. Therefore, I say that the crime of quack doctors is greater than that of robbers. It is not a harsh statement. However, how does a doctor become a quack? It is also a matter of insufficient training and insufficient knowledge. It is found that the two words for quack doctors in English are called "Quack," which is derived from the word Quacksalvcr. Its meaning in English is exaggeration. In German, the word Quack is a human imitation of the sound of chickens and ducks. In Latin, the word Salver has the meaning of wishing people health. Therefore, quack doctors use their eloquent tongues to swindle money. They are truly despicable people. To talk about "Pro Feseion" is like going to the ends of the earth. This is why this art must be treated with caution. The study must not be neglected, and the personality of medical students must be cultivated.</p>
<p>In summary, attention to students' physique and emphasis on morality cannot be neglected. From good students, good doctors are produced. Then the word "Pro Feseion" can be worthy of it. Tacit influence and gradual change depend on the two meanings of self-cultivation. It is often said like an old saying, but a disease of seven years requires mugwort of three years. If it is not accumulated, it will not be obtained for a lifetime. Those who bear the responsibility of medical education should also follow these words.</p>
<h3>Scientific Methods for Nurturing Life (25)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(21) Nutritional Value of Breast Milk</p>
<p>(A) Function of Colostrum</p>
<p>In the first two or three days after childbirth, the mother's body secretes a transparent, thin fluid, like water or pus, with yellowish spots. This is what is called colostrum (also known as new milk or infant milk). Colostrum contains more protein and lactose than regular milk. When viewed under a microscope, colostrum contains fat globules of varying sizes and mulberry-shaped colostrum corpuscles, which are white blood cells with many small fat droplets. These corpuscles gradually decrease after three or four days, and the milk becomes normal, called permanent milk. Although colostrum is thinner than permanent milk, it contains more salts and chemical components, so it has a laxative effect. When a newborn sucks it, it can help excrete meconium. Therefore, it is the best nutrition for infants at the beginning, because a small amount of milk can meet their nutritional needs. In our country, it is customary to mistakenly believe that colostrum is poisonous and discard it completely, instead administering laxatives to excrete meconium, which often leads to gastrointestinal diseases. This is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>(B) Benefits of Self-Nursing</p>
<p>After childbirth, if a mother can breastfeed herself, it will not only benefit the health of the baby, but also help the mother to increase her appetite and add nutrition, and also promote smooth uterine contraction and early discharge of lochia, so that the postpartum period can be safe. Therefore, a child has the right to be nourished by breast milk, and a mother has the obligation to breastfeed personally. Both parties benefit, and there is nothing better than this. Breast milk has the following advantages for the nutrition of biological children:</p>
<p>(1) Breast milk contains enzymes that can help the infant's digestion.</p>
<p>(2) As the infant grows day by day, the nature of the milk also gradually changes, so that development can have natural suitability.</p>
<p>(3) Breast milk is always at a suitable temperature.</p>
<p>(4) There is no contamination of microorganisms, and there is no possibility of spoilage.</p>
<p>(5) Breast milk also contains an antitoxin that can prevent infectious diseases such as diphtheria.</p>
<p>(C) Attention to Secretion</p>
<p>After childbirth, breast milk secretion may be insufficient, or even after three to five or ten days, no secretion is seen. At that time, do not arbitrarily conclude that there is no milk, because milk secretion does not increase without sucking. If the baby sucks slowly, then, unless the mother's body is unhealthy, the milk will surely increase. Otherwise, if another type of milk is substituted because the initial secretion is insufficient, and the baby no longer sucks, not only will breast milk never increase in secretion, but there will also be the disadvantage of being sealed off from then on. Therefore, even if it feels lacking at first, you should still persevere and wait, and let the baby suck frequently, and the source will naturally come. What is commonly called insufficient breast milk is mostly not an inability to secrete fully, but rather a lack of patience.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Enteric Fever (Typhoid Fever) (Continued)</p>
<p>Q: What are the pathological changes of the nervous system?</p>
<p>A: Enteric fever, according to the original meaning in Western languages, comes from the Greek word containing the meaning of haziness. Therefore, it was formerly called nervous fever. In that case, the symptoms of the nervous system will certainly occur. In the early stage of the disease, there are headaches, insomnia, a disinterested appearance, clouded consciousness, or sluggishness. Some fall into a coma and talk deliriously, some are mentally depressed, and some are manic. Sometimes, the patient's palms and forearms twitch obviously, or they reach out with their hands to grasp at empty air. In addition, neurological hearing loss, incontinence of urine and feces, aphasia, hyperesthesia, and motor paralysis are seen. Occasionally, symptoms similar to meningitis occur, such as headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and Kernig's sign.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the circulatory system in patients with enteric fever?</p>
<p>A: The pulse is relatively slow compared to the degree of body temperature. This is unique to this disease. Generally, it does not exceed ninety to one hundred. If the pulse rate exceeds one hundred and twenty or more, it is very dangerous. The heart's apex beat is strong, or the second aortic sound is increased. If both are weakened, it is a sign that the heart has weakened. Blood vessels, venous thrombosis, spontaneous pain, tenderness, and swelling occur, and arteritis may develop.</p>
<p>Q: What changes occur in the blood?</p>
<p>A: Red blood cells and hemoglobin decrease. In the early stage, there is an increase in lymphocytes. By the end of the first week, there is a marked decrease in white blood cells.</p>
<p>Q: What is the condition of the skin in patients with abdominal fever?</p>
<p>A: At the junction of the first and second weeks, rose spots appear on the chest and back, which are unique. These rashes are about the size of a pinhead, and are pale red, congested spots, with several to dozens appearing. Because they fade soon, old and new spots are scattered in various places. There is also a type of miliaria, called crystalline miliaria, commonly known as white blisters, which appear during the period of fever remission when sweating is excessive (third week of illness). There is also herpes labialis, but it is rare. In addition, there is subcutaneous hemorrhage in the lower extremities, necrosis in the hands and feet, bedsores in the sacral region, and severe hair loss.</p>
<p>Q: Do changes also occur in the urinary and reproductive organs of patients with enteric fever?</p>
<p>A: In the first week, feverish proteinuria is mostly seen. Sometimes, the urine of patients in the early stage of acute nephritis shows a double reaction (Diazo-Seaction) and Weiss's reaction. In addition, there are complications such as cystitis, pyelonephritis, orchitis, menstrual abnormalities, premature delivery, and miscarriage.</p>
<p>Q: Do patients with enteric fever often develop beriberi?</p>
<p>A: Yes, especially among those of us who usually eat white rice, because the vitamin B1 in the body is already deficient, the symptoms of beriberi become more apparent when this disease is contracted. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>"Impartial and Upright Criticism"</h3>
<p>— Ye Shengtao</p>
<p>Today I saw Mr. Zhu's article "Massive Sales of Textbooks." He said that textbooks "are special 'commodities' related to children's education, so they should naturally be compared," and that "impartial and upright criticism" is absolutely necessary. As someone who has recently compiled a primary school Chinese textbook, I deeply agree with his words.</p>
<p>Since Chinese textbooks are published by bookstores, and also pursue the wave of "massive sales," preparing to sell them at 70% or 80% of the price, there is no doubt that they are "commodities." However, when I first started manufacturing this "commodity," although I did not want to wear the big hat of "serving culture," I did have a bit of a "non-commercial" intention. Our brothers and sisters read textbooks of "Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon," and our children are said to be reading "children's literature," but the fact tells us that "Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon" and "children's literature" are equally irrelevant. If children's reading and expression abilities have progressed, it is entirely due to other factors. Other factors may not always be encountered, but textbooks are held in hand every day. Why not compile a textbook with the goal of truly developing children's reading and expression abilities? Whether or not this goal can be achieved is a matter of ability, but doing my best is my ambition. With this in mind, I picked up my pen.</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation of content, I made a comprehensive plan, not adopting the disjointed method of "whatever's in the basket is a vegetable." Regarding the inclusion of literary styles, I advocated compatibility and broad selection, and each piece must be a model of its style. Regarding the writing of the lessons, I hoped that they would be easy to read aloud and not contrary to reason. Whether the "commodity" manufactured in this way meets the needs of "customers," whether it is a good tool for primary school education, although I have been a primary school teacher for nearly ten years, I dare not judge myself. This awaits "impartial and upright criticism" from primary school educators across the country.</p>
<p>Under "impartial and upright criticism," if my book has any merit, then, even if it lags behind in the wave of "massive sales," the publisher engaged in business competition will certainly suffer a loss, but the author of the book will have something to comfort himself with: for the few children who read my book, I have at least contributed a gift. Conversely, if my book is completely worthless, or even a harmful poison to children, then, even if it takes the lead in the wave of "massive sales," the publisher engaged in business competition will certainly make ten times the profit, but my crime of crude manufacture will be unforgivable for life!</p>
<p>To be honest, publishers whose only premise is business do not hope for "impartial and upright criticism." However, for the sake of the future of education, this special "commodity" of textbooks must have "impartial and upright criticism." At the same time, for book writers like me who hold a bit of a "non-commercial" intention, the success or failure of "massive sales" does not seem to be what I care about. "Impartial and upright criticism" is what I eagerly hope for.</p>
<h3>"Organization"? Or Plagiarism?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this journal published Mr. Canyue's "A 'Silhouette Collection' of World Literature History," pointing out that Yu Mutao's "World Literature History" was "cut and pasted" from Zheng Zhenduo's "Outline of Literature," Zhao Jingshen's "A Short History of Chinese Literature," etc. After reading it, Mr. Zhao immediately sent a manuscript proving that "people used most of his work." Mr. Yu also has an article in reply, admitting that it was "organization" (this term is really novel!), but not admitting that it was plagiarism. The two articles are published together below, because this journal is a mouthpiece for the people, "the attitude is said to be fair, and the opinions are always unbiased." The right and wrong, merits and demerits, should be judged by the public. - Editor</p>
<h3>Reply to Canyue's Discussion of World Literature History</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>I have long known that Mr. Yu Mutao's scholarship is extraordinary. For example, he once wrote an article in "Popular Literature and Art," talking about the emerging literature of the United States, believing that there were only four people: Sinclair, Jack London, and Gold. How delightful! All the writers of the New Masses can be written off with one stroke!</p>
<p>Canyue said: "If Brother Zhao Jingshen has read this 'decent' masterpiece, he will understand." It seems to be saying that I am "not publicizing" it, but although I am a kind person, if people use most of my work, I cannot remain silent, so I also "publicized" it: "Yu Mutao's 'World Literature History' takes Zhao Jingshen's 'A Short History of Chinese Literature' and other books and cuts them with scissors without changing a word." (See my humble work "Bibliographical Notes on Chinese Literature History Books" in the recent "Micro-Sound Monthly")</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Mr. Yu is ultimately worthy of gratitude. He condescends to my "indecent" little book. I am truly honored by this old work from ten years ago. In another ten or twenty years, my book will definitely be eliminated, and Mr. Yu's masterpiece will be passed down, so that my little literary opinions can be attached to Mr. Yu's coattails and passed down to posterity, which will be especially honorable!</p>
<p>After expressing my gratitude, I hereby list the similarities between the two books (I dare not say that they are stealing mine, and in the future, people may also say that I stole theirs) as follows:</p>
<p>World Literature History, Vol. 1 - A Short History of Chinese Literature</p>
<p>Zeng Guofan's Preface to Ancient Prose - Pages 15 to 209</p>
<p>Qu Yuan, Song Yu, and the Rhapsodies of the Han Dynasty - Pages 28 to 42, Pages 5 to 14</p>
<p>Cao Cao and His Sons - Pages 44 to 47, Pages 18 to 24</p>
<p>Literature of the Jin and Song Dynasties - Pages 49 to 59, Pages 25 to 40</p>
<p>Literature of the Qi, Liang, and Chen Dynasties - Pages 141 to 149, Pages 41 to 56</p>
<p>Li Bai - Pages 154 to 158, Pages 61 to 67</p>
<p>Yuan Zhen and Bai Juyi - Pages 162 to 164, Pages 72 to 75</p>
<p>Ci Poetry of the Northern Song Dynasty - Pages 170 to 178, Pages 117 to 132</p>
<p>Xin Qiji and Lu You - Pages 179 to 180, Pages 134 to 137</p>
<p>Yuan Dynasty Drama - Pages 184 to 90, Pages 157 to 167</p>
<p>Ming Dynasty Chapter Novels - Pages 192 to 198, Pages 168 to 176</p>
<p>After completing the table, I will add a positive review to promote my own work: "My humble work and Sinclair's expert materialist view of world literature history 'share the same insights,' which shows the value of this book."</p>
<h3>Reply to Mr. Canyue</h3>
<p>— Yu Mutao</p>
<p>The present is a transitional era. In this transitional era, our goal is nothing more than to seek to advance the masses towards a realm of freedom. We welcome everything that is beneficial to this great mission; otherwise, we will reject it with all our might.</p>
<p>However, the masses' advancement towards a realm of freedom is not a blind rush; it is guided by a planned theory. I personally naturally support this guiding theory, so I have to use my pen to contribute a little. In short, my personal writing, especially this "organized" world literature history that I have repeatedly declared, is an attempt to generalize and put into practice the theory that I support.</p>
<p>This book is ultimately something that traces historical facts, so, under such a premise, the arrangement of materials, as Mr. Canyue's title indicates, is indeed a "silhouette." Regarding this meaning, I also confessed in "A Small Contribution" on March 18th of this year. The title was about "The World Literature History Story." At that time, I said:</p>
<p>"My pen is sometimes scissors and sometimes an axe, so I cannot avoid cutting and trimming other people's things. I always admit that this book is an organization, and I focus even more on the application of the method that I admire."</p>
<p>That being the case, I boldly admit that the source of this book is not only "History of the Chinese Revolutionary Movement" and four other books, but also more than twenty kinds of books such as "History of the Western Revolution," "The Foundation of Modern Culture," "Japanese Social History," "Japanese Literature History," "History of the Development of European Literature," and "Modern European Literary Trends." I said this in the "Small Contribution" article long ago. Yes, as Mr. Canyue said, this book is a "Silhouette Collection" of "World Literature History."</p>
<p>Having said the main point, I have several statements. The words of the great man that Mr. Canyue suspects are originally a golden rule of KM retold from "History of the Western Revolution." The other two famous sayings also have origins. Please check "Art and Social Life" and "Literature and Revolution." Truth is always truth, and it is not afraid of being from the fourteenth or fifteenth year of the Republic, just as it was the same in 1818 to 1883. At the same time, the reuse of historical materials is by no means a "antique junk stall." Assuming that I copied "Brother Zhao Jingshen's" A Short History of Chinese Literature in some places, then didn't "Brother Zhao Jingshen" copy the works of literati from the Han and Wei dynasties onwards? Mr. Canyue may not admit that "Brother" is a creative literary historian. As for the criticism, it was originally requested by the publisher. For example, "Brother Zhao Jingshen's" compilations, which Mr. Canyue admires, had this trick first. In fact, this is a bad trend of the time, and Mr. Canyue can easily find that the textbook-like things published by various bookstores now have this boring set. These gentlemen's criticisms were originally invited by me on behalf of the publisher. If Mr. Canyue does not believe it, he can directly inquire with the publisher or the original person. To especially add parentheses and deliberately confuse the public, perhaps you are borrowing someone's wine glass. In short, the atmosphere of clearing up academics has begun, and I hope everyone will completely approach it with a fair attitude. Finally, I solemnly declare that I am not a follower of Sinclair. I cannot return the favor of the hat!</p>
<h3>Reading "Gorky"</h3>
<p>— Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Mr. Zou Taofen, in his busy editorial life at Life Weekly, compiled and translated a book of over 200,000 words, "Revolutionary Literature - Gorky."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun called this book "a very good gift for Chinese youth." I think that every young person who wants to fight against the dark environment with unwavering determination should accept this solemn gift.</p>
<p>The life of Gorky, the greatest writer in the world today, is a life of struggle. In his third autobiography, My Universities, he once said:</p>
<p>"From this time on, I deeply felt that life is a struggle."</p>
<p>Every young person in China today is trekking along the same arduous path that Gorky once traversed. We demand survival, and we must engage in arduous and unyielding struggles. From Gorky's lifelong achievements in battle, there is much that is worth learning bravely. In this sense, Mr. Taofen's book, like the Life Weekly he edits, has indelible merits.</p>
<p>Gorky rose from an apprentice in a shoe store, a cook's assistant, a baker, and a vagrant to the highest peak of the world literary scene. This meaning is by no means in his personal "determination to succeed," like many other so-called "great men." His surprising appearance in this world cannot be separated from the appearance of the Soviet Union in this world. At the end of the 19th century, the Russian intelligentsia completely lost the basis of their social existence and showed a decadent and declining atmosphere. The literary scene was filled with sorrowful whimpers. Gorky's appearance represented the hungry masses raising their heads from the underground, so he was able to capture the heart of the era and shift to a completely different new genre. However, the description in this book inevitably neglects this main social reason, which cannot but make us consider it the biggest shortcoming.</p>
<p>There are also many omissions and errors in the historical facts. For example, the main reason why the Russian Imperial Academy elected him as an honorary member was that the Hugo Centennial Conference was held in Paris in 1901. He was invited internationally as the representative of the Russian literary world, so that the Tsar's loyal subjects could not erase his status. Also, the work "Mother" was started in Sorento, Italy, after being expelled from the United States in 1907, not in the United States.</p>
<p>Regarding Gorky's relationship with the Soviet government, the evaluation of the New Life era by the government and the oppression of the intellectual class is completely an exaggerated description. The editor's understanding of the Russian Revolution is very weak. For example, "It was all thanks to Lenin's wit and keen redirection that he resolutely adopted state capitalism in the form of the New Economic Policy." Also, the expulsion of Rykov was said to be due to discord with Stalin. Many descriptions are even more contradictory: for example, it is said that "During the Bolshevik dictatorship, the political autocracy and oppression were the same as Tsarism," but at the same time, it is said that "They adopted completely opposite educational policies from the beginning." And so on.</p>
<p>However, when we think that the editor's basis is the work of a bourgeois professor, then although we have not read the original book, we can understand the source of these contradictory descriptions. Those clever anti-Soviet scholars can praise Lenin on the one hand and slander the Russian Revolution on the other hand, not to mention that in the context of writing about Gorky, there are certainly many opportunities to create their demagoguery.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be considered regrettable that this book completely fails to mention Gorky's artistic achievements, which are the most important.</p>
<p>Creative Novel</p>
<h3>Ordinary Things (14)</h3>
<p>— Guosun</p>
<p>The factory worker representatives thought that this was what Zhiguang said in response to them, and therefore thought that what they wanted to say had already been said, so one of them said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang's words are really good. It won't stand without assistance!"</p>
<p>"I think relief is necessary," Zhiguang said as if waking up from a dream. "Since the affairs of Zhabei are our own affairs, but now it is up to Mr. Yao to agree! I am willing to provide relief, but I can't come up with anything!"</p>
<p>"We hope that Mr. Zhang can go and persuade Mr. Yao." Several people said at the same time.</p>
<p>"This is naturally appropriate," Zhiguang said, "but how do you all hope to provide relief? What will you use to provide relief?"</p>
<p>"We hope for everyone's relief! We don't care about cash, materials are also useful, and what is most important is vehicles."</p>
<p>"This is naturally not something I can decide," Zhiguang said, "but if you all want me to persuade Mr. Yao, it is best if we can have sufficient reasons to make him believe immediately, and we can have concrete measures to make him follow immediately. Just now, those few sentences are too general, too empty."</p>
<p>"We think the larger the number, the better," said the representative surnamed Lin. "The method will be handled temporarily depending on the situation. The reason is our sincere determination to resist the enemy!"</p>
<p>"Our sincere determination to resist the enemy!" Several people said in unison.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows this," Zhiguang said, "but the affairs of the factory are ultimately not something that Mr. Yao can decide on his own. Looking at the factory's business this year, it has already lost half of it. We must think of a way not to make this matter rigid, do you all understand?"</p>
<p>"The loss of half of the business this year may be more than just our factory's business," said the representative surnamed Qiu, "If we don't provide relief to Zhabei, nothing will stand firm, Mr. Zhang!"</p>
<p>"We are asking Mr. Yao to provide relief," said another representative, "for everyone's sake, so that everyone can stand firm!"</p>
<p>"When we face those workers who have gone to Zhabei," said another representative, "we feel really ashamed, so we want to do our best to ask our boss to think for everyone!"</p>
<p>"How many people from our factory have gone in total?" Zhiguang asked.</p>
<p>"About fifty or so," Representative Qiu said slowly. "The exact number we know now is that seven have returned!"</p>
<p>"Seven have returned!" Zhiguang said with a half-doubtful, half-surprised look.</p>

<h3>On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Borrowing American Cotton and its Relationship to the Textile Industry by Liu Jingji</h3>
<p>Recently, the government's borrowing of 50 million gold yuan worth of American cotton and wheat has sparked debate among the government and the public, and has been the subject of commentary from various countries. Almost every newspaper carries news of this matter, some using it to attack private individuals, some believing that it is essential to rescue us from our perilous situation, some advocating for its use in productive construction, and others regarding it as a policy of drinking poison to quench thirst. All of this stems from differing perspectives due to different positions, and there are particularly divergent views on the distribution methods. Therefore, even after more than a month of brewing, the actual loan terms and procurement pricing methods have not yet been announced. Although the industry has held several small-group consultations due to vested interests, they have ultimately been unable to discuss the matter in the absence of a government announcement. Therefore, the past situation has only created anxiety for the government and the people, and especially for our textile industry.</p>
<p>On the government's side, the sudden influx of such a large sum of money has led to a flurry of demands for salaries, repayment of debts, and requests for subsidies from various parties. Moreover, it has also triggered open and covert struggles. While the authorities mediating these issues inevitably face some mental strain, it is ultimately our people who bear the brunt of the impact.</p>
<p>On the textile industry's side, when this news first arrived, speculators seized the opportunity to create a speculative atmosphere, causing market chaos. Buyers adopted a wait-and-see approach, and yarn prices plummeted by more than ten yuan, while cloth prices fell by three to five jiao, as if the arrival of American cotton would lead to an unfathomable drop in market prices. In reality, American cotton imports have been a regular occurrence over the years. However, in the past, merchants would assess consumption needs and market prices to determine whether to purchase cotton in batches. Now, the process has shifted to government wholesale loans and phased shipments to China. In the social psyche, the perception that the borrowing of such a large amount of foreign cotton would inevitably lead to oversupply caused a sudden change in the market, and yarn prices plummeted, causing manufacturers to suffer this undeserved misfortune. Initially, they hoped that what was lost in the east would be gained in the west, and that cheaper raw materials were still to come. However, Japanese merchants seized the opportunity to manipulate the market, buying up large quantities of domestic cotton. Unscrupulous merchants, driven by profit, did not hesitate to act as accomplices, further exacerbating the divergence between cotton and yarn prices. Chinese factories procrastinated and watched, missing the opportunity. Nevertheless, they still believed that there was a final glimmer of hope. However, the American government, sparing no effort to achieve its goal of inflating the currency, first proposed increasing the tariff by four cents per pound, followed by a plan to destroy a quarter of the cotton seedlings, aiming to create a situation of reduced planting and increased harvest. Regardless of the motives or foolishness of these measures, market prices have indeed continued to rise by one or two hundred pounds. News of our government's cotton borrowing pricing and shipping has been indefinitely delayed. Manufacturers missed the opportunity before and are now witnessing a sharp rise in American cotton prices. Looking around, the sales of yarn and cloth are also pessimistic. They are truly in a dilemma, and their plight is several times worse than it was two months ago. Yet, the announcements of wage cuts and factory closures are not as frequent as before. The work of petitioning for relief has also stalled, which is quite strange. Some say that yarn factories previously reduced production due to oversupply. Now, the impending closures are due to a lack of raw materials, without considering the issues of cost and supply and demand. Is there perhaps another motive behind this? Our industry has reached such a difficult situation that if we do not seek fundamental remedies ourselves and merely regard borrowing American cotton as a temporary stroke of luck, I fear that the future will be even more dangerous than today.</p>
<p>Regarding cotton prices, manufacturers are currently spinning 20-count yarn using raw materials costing 50 yuan. Based on the usual calculations of various factories, each bale must result in a loss of more than 20 yuan. If using the American cotton borrowed by the government, the current market price would be 63 yuan per dan, inevitably resulting in a loss of 70 to 80 yuan. Manufacturers are naturally unwilling to choose the heavier burden over the lighter one. Therefore, there have been rumors of selling American cotton at 80% of its value, which the government has categorically denied. In reality, the rumors merely suggest that domestic cotton contains 80% of the value of American cotton, meaning that American cotton is more than 20% better than domestic cotton. From a business perspective, American cotton coming to China cannot match domestic cotton unless sold at 80% of its value. In short, it is only natural that no one will buy it unless it is sold at the market price of domestic cotton. Therefore, those who speculate on the government's intentions believe that it will inevitably adopt a discount method similar to that used for government bonds, meaning that it will have to sell at a reduced price. Furthermore, since the government borrowed American cotton under the guise of rescuing yarn factories, it must lower the cost of cotton for yarn factories to avoid further losses. Therefore, it must lower the price even further than the current market price of domestic cotton. These speculations only cause anxiety and uncertainty, while the fundamental yarn and cloth industry is under pressure, deteriorating further and suffering a major blow.</p>
<p>Regarding the rural areas, our country has a vast land and abundant resources, and has been an agricultural nation for more than 5,000 years. In recent years, due to natural disasters and human calamities, the rural economy has collapsed. Cotton, wheat, and rice all rely on imports from abroad to sustain us. The outflow of wealth is regrettable. However, on the one hand, we can still consider the amount of domestic consumption and the prosperity of the market, allowing merchants to adjust surpluses and deficits and act according to their capabilities. On the other hand, we still hope for political stability and urgently cultivate agricultural production in order to reverse this disastrous trend. The government's proactive methods of rescuing the rural areas have not yet been realized, while its passive policies involve borrowing large quantities of cotton and wheat. While the government has a large income from this, it is enough to alleviate the immediate crisis. If these goods are shipped to China regardless of market prices and consumption, and dumped in batches, it will inevitably disrupt the balance of domestic supply and demand, and greatly affect the social economy and agricultural prices. Cheap grain harms farmers, as has been clearly taught throughout history. Therefore, relying on foreign goods to adjust people's livelihoods without seeking fundamental revitalization is akin to heading south to reach the north. Even within our textile industry, raw materials are obtained from farmers, and yarn and cloth are sold to the masses, with merchants acting as intermediaries, forming a natural organization. Now, using foreign raw materials to produce yarn and cloth for sale domestically, the rural areas do not have the income from such raw material prices, and how can they afford to consume so many finished products? Its purchasing power can already be anticipated. Therefore, the government's borrowing of American cotton may be considered a means of raising funds, but not a means of rescuing yarn factories. Furthermore, the market price of American cotton is more than ten yuan per dan higher than that of domestic cotton, as mentioned earlier. Calculating the total value of the loan, the difference in market price alone amounts to a loss of 30 million national currency, and other expenses and losses from wheat are not included. Regardless of whether the government or the yarn factories bear this market price loss, it is ultimately the people of our country who suffer, and it is our country's money that flows out. In the future, repayments will be made on schedule, without any deductions. Regardless of how low the interest rate is or how suitable the terms are, this additional loss of 30 million yuan is worth pondering. In summary, the advantages and disadvantages of borrowing cotton and wheat this time are evident. I only hope that the proposals of the Legislative Yuan and the opinions of society will be followed, and that, in addition to the government's designated uses, the funds will be used for productive enterprises as a fund for rescuing rural areas and developing transportation, so that domestic cotton and wheat production can be revitalized, transportation can be facilitated, and the goals of restoring agriculture and stimulating industry can be achieved. This would not betray this significant sacrifice, and would be fortunate not only for our textile industry, but also be crucial for the survival of our nation. I hope that my colleagues in the textile industry will work together to achieve this.</p>
<h3>Raising Prices and the Policy of Inflation by Chao Gou</h3>
<p>The economic conference has been going on for four weeks, and in the past few days it has effectively run aground. The reason for this impasse lies in the dispute between gold standard countries and non-gold standard countries over monetary issues. The United States argues that any discussions on stabilizing currency cannot take place until prices are raised first. France and the gold standard countries it leads insist that all discussions must be based on the premise of current currency stability. The United Kingdom has been vacillating between the two sides, because although the UK is one of the countries that has abandoned the gold standard, it is concerned about the unlimited and drastic fall of the US dollar. At the same time, the various British colonies have a special relationship with the United States, making it impossible for the UK to unconditionally join the group of gold standard countries. The content of the four-week conference has been nothing more than the infighting of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France!</p>
<p>The seriousness of the so-called monetary issue stems entirely from the price issue. Because people want to solve the price problem from the currency itself, currency has become the center of world economic problems. After the outbreak of the panic in 1929, world prices fell by about half, greatly increasing the burden on producers. The degree of burden also varied among producers. Generally speaking, industries and businesses could restrict production and other methods to restrain the decline in prices, while in agriculture, the raw materials used were mostly industrial products with high prices (such as fertilizers), and the products produced were low in price due to overproduction, suffering even more. In addition, producers outside of agriculture had expanded production during the temporary good times after the war, and the debts they owed required them to sell twice as many commodities to repay due to the halved prices. German reparations could not be paid due to the decline in prices, and the suspension of reparations naturally shook Europe's war debts to the United States. All of the panics in recent years have been centered on the price problem.</p>
<p>The purpose of raising prices is to alleviate the pressure of increased debt on these private or public groups. By what means can prices be raised? The simplest method is to reduce the value of the currency, that is, to use inflation to raise prices, generally aiming to restore the price level of 1928. After raising prices, the benefits for individuals are reduced debt and increased purchasing power, which can stimulate commercial and industrial activity. The international benefit is that it relieves the pressure on debtor countries, making it easier for them to fulfill their debts, restores the credit of debtor countries, and gradually abolishes all commercial restrictions. Therefore, raising prices is considered by capitalist countries to be a necessary condition for overcoming the recession. However, we know that it can only be effective if a country raises its prices, then the country's commodities will immediately decline in exports and increase in imports, with continuous outflow of cash. Not only will it not find a recovery, but the economic situation will continue to deteriorate. To remedy this, it is necessary to take the measure of prohibiting gold exports. However, if a country implements a ban on gold exports, on the one hand, it can raise domestic prices, and at the same time, because the value of the domestic currency falls, the high domestic prices are actually low internationally, and exports naturally increase. In order to prevent the outflow of their own currency and to protect their industries and businesses, other countries cannot but take two measures: one is to use the same method of prohibiting gold exports to reduce their own currency and wage a currency war with the countries that have abandoned the gold standard; the other is to increase import tax rates to create a tariff barrier, so that the other party's export profits are offset. The United States is now using the former method. It is precisely because the United States has abandoned the gold standard that the world's currency war is intensifying.</p>
<p>The proper way is to first stop the currency war between countries, agree on the exchange rate between countries, and implement synchronous inflation. If all countries raise prices together, then no country will particularly benefit or suffer, and it will be very effective in reducing the pressure on debtors.</p>
<p>However, this is a theoretical principle, and there are several difficulties at present: First, under the current uneven distribution of gold in the world, it is very difficult to implement a consistent inflation policy. Some countries that have banned gold exports have already reduced their gold reserves to the minimum, and there is very little room for implementing an inflation policy. In fact, only the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, which have relatively abundant gold reserves, can inflate the currency by reducing the gold reserve ratio. If other countries cannot adopt the same proportion of inflation policy as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, then the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will certainly not want to adopt this, because if the United Kingdom, the United States, and France inflate the currency separately and raise domestic prices, it is impossible to prevent the surge in imports without banning gold exports. In the final analysis, it will still fall into the current currency war. The surplus gold of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will never be able to leave the country, which is of no benefit to the world economy. From an economic point of view, the concentration of gold in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France does promote the trend of economic panic. Unless it is redistributed to various countries, no country will have international purchasing power, and it will be difficult to implement an effective international currency inflation policy in the same proportion. Second, let's try to examine whether there is any possibility of redistributing gold. We know that the flow of funds usually has two methods: one is the borrowing and investment of money from gold-rich countries to other countries, which is impossible in an atmosphere of insecurity. The second is to ask gold-rich countries to sacrifice some and endure a state of import surplus, which is also a dead end. The biggest contradiction now is that the gold-rich United Kingdom, the United States, and France are unwilling to stand in the position of import surplus, and are willing to accept commodities from other countries, but they are unwilling to implement protectionist policies, clinging to gold and causing gold to fall into a so-called "sterilized" state. Therefore, if the United Kingdom, the United States, and France do not sacrifice some economic interests, such as reducing import taxes, stabilizing their currencies, and lifting the gold ban, then it will be difficult to have a new distribution of gold, and there will be no hope of raising world prices. Third, before implementing a consistent world currency inflation policy, it is necessary to determine the new parity of each country's currency. The old parity is no longer possible to restore after the chaos of the past few years, but determining the new parity is still a difficult problem to solve. Most countries have not been able to abandon the viewpoint of nationalism, and always want to set the parity of their own currency a little lower than other countries in order to seek an advantage in trade, so the estimation of the exchange rate parity has become the first dispute. Second, even if there is an agreed exchange rate agreement, what means should be used to maintain it? The maintenance of parity must be based on the premise of the free flow of commodities and funds, otherwise the exchange rate will still fluctuate and inevitably fall into a new exchange rate competition. Looking at the weakness of the British Exchange Equalisation Account's control over the US dollar, we can see the difficulty of stabilizing the value of world currencies.</p>
<h3>Economic Problems in the Constitution by Mao Zhenchu</h3>
<p>The draft "Constitution of the Republic of China" written by Wu Jingxiong, a member of the Legislative Yuan and concurrently a member of the Constitution Drafting Committee, has been published in newspapers for public discussion. Commentators often say that the constitution is a contract between the government and the people, so it contains more political meaning and less content related to people's livelihood and economy. It is important to know that today's world is no longer comparable to the era of Rousseau's Social Contract in the seventeenth century, and there can be no talk of politics without economics. The reason why countries around the world have fallen into the abyss of economic panic and cannot extricate themselves is, in the final analysis, due to the "capitalist economic organization" which has contributed to it. If the economy is not properly resolved, the suffering of the people will not be eliminated for a single day. Even China's current situation, with internal social unrest and external threats from invaders, can all be attributed to economic decline as the root cause. Now, Wu's draft already has a chapter on people's livelihood, which shows that he has paid attention to the economy. However, based on my temporary thoughts, I would like to record my views for discussion with those who have insight.</p>
<p>According to Article 186 of Chapter 1, Section 4 of the draft, "The economic organization shall be based on the principle of fairness, so that all citizens can maintain a decent living." What is fairness? What is an economic organization? How can it ensure that all citizens can maintain a decent living? If the government is determined to maintain the existing capitalist system based on private property and free competition as the principle of economic organization, do we consider it fair? It is well known that this economic organization based on individuals has become the sediment of the past trend. From now on, the so-called economic socialization based on the entire society and the masses should be the principle of organization, and the Principle of People's Livelihood should be the guide. The Principle of People's Livelihood seeks the fairness of the entire society's people in production and distribution through peaceful and gradual political power. China's current problem lies in "poverty," not "inequality," so production is more urgent than distribution. However, attention should also be paid to the problem of inequality after the development of production, and measures should be taken to prevent it. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's two major policies for the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, "restriction of capital" and "equalization of land ownership," embody the principle of fair distribution in the principle of fair production. The author's intention should also be to take these two major policies as the principle of the so-called fair economic organization in this article. For example, the wording of the article could be changed to "The national economic organization shall be based on the two fair principles of restricting capital and equalizing land ownership, so that all citizens can maintain a decent living." This would not only clearly define what kind of fair economic organization it is, but also show the true spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and be consistent with Article 1 of the draft, "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People."</p>
<p>Labor is the basis of production. How can there be production without labor? To seek progress in production, we must increase the amount of labor. To seek fairness in production, we must make labor universal. Article 169 of the draft states, "The people of the Republic of China have the obligation to engage in mental or physical labor without violating justice and humanity." And Article 170 states, "Those who have the ability to work but are unemployed due to idleness or negligence, the government shall provide assistance to provide them with appropriate job opportunities. Those who have jobs shall be protected by government regulations to improve their lives." These seem to be set up for this purpose. According to the "National people have the obligation to engage in mental or physical labor without violating good customs" proposed in the two constitutions of December 12th and 14th, the German Constitution of 1919 recognized labor as a moral obligation, the old Russian constitution had forced labor, and Article 46 of the new Spanish constitution stated that "all labor is a social obligation and should be protected by law." All have the same provisions. However, it is not mentioned what kind of sanctions should be imposed on those who have the ability to work but do not have the obligation to work. Then, does this obligation to work violate the principle of fairness? The old Russian constitution had the provision that "those who do not work, do not eat," which is certainly inappropriate. However, if they are allowed to evade labor without punishment, then the saying that labor is an obligation becomes just a formality. Furthermore, if there are those who have the ability to work and are willing to perform the obligation to work, but have no opportunity to work, is the government responsible? Or if there are those who have the ability to work but are unemployed due to idleness or negligence, and still cannot get appropriate job opportunities under the government's assistance, does the government have other supplementary methods such as subsidies to ensure their survival? All of these are not indicated in the scope, so it is difficult to say whether there will be questions in the implementation.</p>
<p>More than 80% of the Chinese people are farmers, and the entire Chinese economic system relies on the rural economy as its cornerstone. If the rural economy is allowed to continue to collapse as it is now, then the national economy will inevitably collapse along with it. (To put it bluntly, it is now on the road to this collapse). The biggest difficulties in the current rural economy are: (1) The income from agricultural crops is not enough to cover the expenses of land tax, rent, fertilizer, seeds, etc.; (2) Tillers do not own their land. Therefore, the solutions, in addition to actively reducing or exempting taxes, maintaining the price of agricultural products, and re-allocating cultivated land to truly achieve the goal of tillers owning their land, there is no better solution. Therefore, the various items related to the development of the rural economy in Article 172 of the draft should be revised, and especially the empty article in item 6, "improving the status of tenant farmers and increasing the welfare of agricultural workers," may as well be deleted.</p>
<p>"The greatest cause of economic inequality is the control of land rights by a few people. Therefore, the state should formulate land laws, land use laws, land expropriation laws, and land value tax laws. Private land should be reported to the government by the landowners. The state will levy taxes according to the price and purchase it at the reported price when necessary." This is the restriction on private land by the Chinese National Party at the First National Congress. This is also Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle that the natural increase in land value should be owned by the public. Although Article 176 of the draft also has the clear statement that "Private land should be regulated by law to strictly prevent abuse, abandonment, and concentration in the hands of a few people," which is consistent with the above meaning. However, the wording is not very complete, and it should be changed to: "Private land should be regulated by law to strictly prevent abuse, abandonment, hoarding, and concentration in the hands of a few people. The government may also levy taxes or purchase it according to the price set by the landowners. All value added due to natural causes should be owned by the public."</p>
<p>The extreme expansion of the private property system violates the principle of "fair economic organization." In other words, it is tantamount to establishing a front to protect the individual capital system, an "unfair economic organization." Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "The purpose of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to overthrow the capital system." Therefore, the Principle of People's Livelihood and the capital system are fundamentally incompatible in principle. Since we have adopted the restriction of capital as the principle of economic fairness, we should not allow the extreme expansion of the private property system that directly protects the capital system. Before the current environment of the private property system allows for complete abolition, articles restricting it should be clearly stated in the constitution. Although Article 179 of Wu's draft has restrictions on inheritance, inheritance is the accumulation of personal private property during one's lifetime, which is left to one's heirs after death. Rather than restricting its inheritance after death, it would be more appropriate to impose stricter prevention on its accumulation during one's lifetime. (The original text is: "The inheritance of property should be restricted by law or taxation, but only to the extent that the heir does not lose the necessary resources for survival and development.")</p>
<p>To develop the national economy, we must develop industry and 末田. Moreover, under the current state of widespread "poverty" in China, we should develop industry as much as possible and engage in production to make poverty alleviation the urgent task. As for the plan to develop industry, we believe that it may be based on the "Industrial Plan," with key provisions, such as building railways, dredging rivers, etc., listed and clearly stated, and the sources of funds used to develop these industries should be specified, so that it does not become a mere formality and can be done in a practical way. Article 180 of the draft states, "In order to promote the development of the national economy, the government should promote various cooperative enterprises and insurance enterprises." We believe that cooperative enterprises and insurance enterprises cannot generate any direct and powerful forces for the development of the national economy. They can only be said to assist the development of the economy. The facts stated in this article for the development of the national economy are somewhat putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>Article 181 of the draft states: "All industries with patent or monopoly characteristics should be operated independently by the government with centralized capital." It is necessary to know that before the capital system is eliminated, all industries have the possibility of patents and monopolies. Which industries should be operated independently by the government with centralized capital? It has not been listed. Although it has been slightly mentioned in the various articles of Chapter 5 of Section 3 of the same draft on the relationship between the central government and local governments, it is better to list them in detail. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent the government from abusing this power, so as not to harm the true meaning of restricting capital. If the government sees a profitable business, it will seize it. This kind of arrogant and high-handed behavior is harmful and not beneficial to the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>In Wu's constitutional draft, there may be more than the above-mentioned articles on people's livelihood and economy that should be carefully revised. However, among them, those that can be considered more important are generally limited to this. In the past, when Sun Shutong formulated the court etiquette, Liu Bang said that he now knew the value of the world. Today, when formulating the constitution, we believe that we now know the value of people's livelihood and economy. This is why we have to pay attention.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Beiping's Social Economy by Cheng Wenai</h3>
<p>1.  General Overview of the Old Capital:  We all know that Beiping has been the capital since the Yuan Dynasty. The imperial city occupies the entire central area of Beiping, and officialdom permeates the entire old capital. The sight of officials in red hats and peacock feathers clearing the way still occurs from time to time.  On the other hand, Western influences have also arrived, and a few modern men and women are interspersed among them. Therefore, a combination of Chinese and Western styles appears simultaneously, which is quite interesting!  Most of Beiping's residents are probably still in deep sleep, dreaming of wealth and glory, when the sun is already high in the sky. Perhaps because Beiping is not an industrial or commercial area, most residents live a life of ease. However, this has resulted in a large number of people being unemployed for particular reasons. Recently, some people have advocated designating Beiping as a cultural area. This approach is not bad. However, I feel that one point should be noted, which is to eliminate bad habits. Otherwise, if culture is also influenced by the atmosphere of officialdom, the future is unthinkable. Below is a brief analysis of Beiping's social economy. Due to the limitations of space in this publication, statistics on area and population will be omitted. However, according to a recent survey, among the population of more than 1.46 million, the total number of unemployed men and women reached 900,541. In other words, the unemployed account for more than 61% of the city's population, which is a major crisis for the social economy's future. However, it must be understood that these unemployed people are the kind of residents mentioned above who are gluttonous, lazy, and reliant on inheritance, which is different from the unemployment problems in advanced industrial countries. Otherwise, Beiping's social economy would have long been in a state of panic.</p>
<h3>2. Overview of Industry</h3>
<p>Because Beiping is not an industrial or commercial area, there is little industry to speak of. The establishment of large factories is almost non-existent. What can be described is only handicraft industry. The most important among the handicrafts is the carpet industry. There are a total of 80 carpet factories in Beiping, with a total capital of 38,636 yuan, a total of 2,320 workers, with the highest wage being 18 yuan and the lowest being 10 yuan. The reason for its development is that it does not require huge capital, and the profit is also high. It is estimated that a carpet of more than one square meter sells for more than 100 yuan, and the net profit is about 20 to 30 yuan. The raw material is camel hair, mostly from Zhangjiakou. The carpet industry has a long history. The quality of Chinese products is inferior to that of Persian carpets, but the patterns are better than imported products, and the cost is low. Therefore, in the past 20 years, it has been very popular with foreigners, with Europe being the main sales market. Among the carpet factories in Beiping, the "Cheng Lie" company is the largest in scale, located on Wangfujing Street, and exports a lot overseas every year. However, in recent years, because foreigners have set up factories in China with capital and plan to use machines for weaving, and the products are cheaper and better, and Chinese people do not pay attention to improvement, the products that stick to old methods will inevitably fail. The handicraft industry second to the carpet industry is cloisonné enamel, which also has a long history. It is made by applying enamel to copperware and firing it four or five times. The products of the Ming Dynasty are the most precious. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, although the patterns were more advanced, the colors were far from comparable to those of the Ming Dynasty. This can be compared when visiting the Palace Museum. There are a total of 28 cloisonné enamel factories in Beiping, with a total capital of 3,165 yuan. There are a total of 438 workers, with the highest wage being 8 yuan and the lowest being 2 yuan. The "Jing Tai Hang" on Dengshikou Road is the largest in Beiping operating this industry. In recent years, the export of cloisonné enamel has been mostly to the United States, with large shipments each time. However, most of them are ordinary products, and because they are mass-produced, no attention is paid to the manufacturing process, and sales have plummeted. The next is gauze lanterns, that is, palace lanterns, which are one of the art products, and are also shipped overseas in large quantities every year. The embassies of various countries in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beiping, also display them. In short, the handicrafts in Beiping that are related to international trade are only these.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Continued to Advance to New Highs Last Week</h3>
<p>New High Prices Appeared One After Another, but the Rise Was Slightly Lower Than the Previous Week.  Last week, from July 10th to 15th, the trend in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was still very bullish. Although the increase was not as large as in the previous week, it was particularly commendable that it continued to be strong after already rising so high. The bond market environment remained dull and unchanged, but the strength of market sentiment was truly rare. New high prices appeared one after another, but demand did not decrease as a result. Although the market price was already at least 60% above par, the bulls did not shrink back as a result. It is not necessarily impossible for various bonds to continue to rise and increase in value. Those covering shorts only seek to advance, regardless of price. Old bulls are reluctant to sell easily. The supply side relies solely on adjustments from swaps and arbitrage trades, so chips are increasingly scarce. There are quite a few people in the market who have long-term ideas for going long, regardless of the market price, and swapping on a monthly basis. The benefits of this are considerable and also stable, and it does not require all of one's capital. Therefore, without major changes in the situation, the market price can still rise again in the future. On Monday, there was a slight pullback, and retail investors all sold, falling by one yuan. This was a reaction to the previous week's surge, which was inevitable. Because the pullback was too rapid, it turned higher again on Tuesday. Quite a few syndicates bought in and covered shorts, and the market price turned sharply higher, rising by 1.23 to 1.5 yuan. On Wednesday, there was talk that the Sino-British loan had been established, and market sentiment became even more bullish. Short sellers were hit hard. The 20-series bonds rose the most sharply, with demand being the strongest for the 16th, rising by 1.67 yuan. The rest also rose by more than one yuan, but the 96-series and the Zheng 6-series bonds weakened slightly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Starting Thursday, trading was changed to half-day sessions, and trading was still considerable. The market price was slightly chaotic due to bulls exiting and swaps, falling first and then rising, resulting in a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. On Friday, bulls still exited the 13-series and 50-series bonds, and the market price rose first and then fell, resulting in more gains than losses. On Saturday, swap transactions were more common, and the market still had a hesitant appearance, resulting in mixed gains and losses. Looking at the entire week, the upward trend has not subsided. Although bulls exited fiercely in the second half of the week, the market price did not fall sharply, and there was a slight sideways trend. The strength of market sentiment can be seen from this. Judging from the situation, it is not likely to be a problem to see through things. The environment is extremely stable. Due to the scarcity of chips, it is not easy to fall suddenly in the future. The result of one week's market prices was that they continued to rise by 0.5 to 1.78 yuan. The long gold bonds rose by 1.9 yuan, and the short gold bonds rose by 2.2 yuan. However, the 96-series bonds only rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The total number of transactions was 73,245,500 yuan, 55,500 yuan in spot, and 23.8 million in unified salt tax futures, 8.4 million in cut bonds, 7.34 million in combined 20-series bonds, 13.9 million in 20-series bonds, 10.32 million in 96-series bonds, and the rest ranged from 400,000 to 1.34 million.</p>

<h3>Grain: Heavy Indica Rice Falls by About 10 Cents</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources, but outbound traffic on this street slowed down, and the market was weak. Heavy indica rice all depreciated by about 10 cents. Only Duyang pointed rice was still stable. Tianjin merchants suddenly turned their attention to thin rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, and other central regions, totaling more than 1,000 bags. However, the market was dull due to scattered customer interest, and the price was also weak, depreciating by about 10 cents. Yinbian Yuan was still outstanding.</p>

<p>(North of Shanghai) About 12 or 13 boats arrived from various gangs along the river. White indica was dull and weak, and the price of medium-grade was slightly softer by several cents. Early rice and Yangjian arrived and sold sluggishly, and the price showed a weak trend. Thin rice and Dukjian arrived and sold fairly evenly, and the price did not change. Although the departure of Bianyuan was ordinary, the arrival of goods was scarce, and the market price increased by 20 to 30 cents. Yinyuan was out of stock and there was no market.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Crude and White Sugar Decline Unabated</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to decline, and the trend was very weak, resulting in sluggish transactions. The market was still downstream. The association set the price of ordinary grade 24 crude and white sugar down another 10 cents, with only 100 bags sold at 20.15 yuan. No transactions were made for grade 20 medium white sugar. Dutch Red KD was quoted at 16.10 yuan, but no deal was made. Taikoo Sugar K was quoted at 21.30 yuan, and KY was quoted at 20.70 yuan. The factory's refined white sugar, China No. 1, was quoted at 19.65 yuan, but no deal was made.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Vegetables: First Batch of Jinshan Branches Arrive</h3>
<p>The new crop of Guangdong Jinshan branches is in short supply this year. The first batch has now arrived in Shanghai, totaling more than 50 boxes. Yesterday, the higher-quality ones were quoted at 57 yuan, the second-grade ones were quoted at 52.8 to 50.5 yuan, and the ordinary ones were quoted at 44 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: New Silk Samples Begin to Be Distributed</p>
<h3>Summer Cocoons in Huxun Have Lower Silk Yield</h3>
<p>Farmers in the Huzhou and Nanxun areas are mostly raising foreign silkworm varieties for summer cocoons. The cocoons are still of good quality. Because silkworm farmers dislike the low cocoon prices, most of them are drying and reeling the silk themselves. The yield is not low, with drying shrinkage being only 280 to 290 catties and reeling shrinkage being 570 to 580 catties, almost comparable to spring cocoons.</p>
<h3>Wuxi's New Long Reeled Silk Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Silk factories in Wuxi have been operating for more than a month. The daily production of silk cocoon by-products is increasing. New long reeled silk from silk factories has begun to be shipped to Shanghai. Yesterday, 68 pieces arrived by the Shanghai-Nanjing train. Samples are now being distributed.</p>
<h3>Rayon Inventory in Shanghai Is Not Weak</h3>
<p>The demand for rayon in the inland areas is low, and sales are sluggish. The supply is still strong, and the inventory is accumulating. There are currently over 4,800 boxes of European and American rayon waiting to be picked up.</p>

<h3>Two Kinds of Welcomes</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Shanghai has really been very lively in the past two years, because since the outbreak of national crisis, there has been not only the government's determination to resist, leading to a ceasefire agreement, but also the enthusiasm of foreign gentlemen. Seeing them coming from thousands of miles away, one naturally asks, "Will they also benefit our country?" Therefore, officials and scholars led the common people, washed their hands, burned incense, and welcomed them piously.</p>
<p>What we cannot forget most is welcoming the Lytton Commission of Inquiry. The mission of their arrival was clearly written on the signboard. It was like an imperial envoy patrolling the streets, seeing an old man beaten bloody by a scoundrel, and only needing to say a few fair words could make the old man kneel down and thank him with joy, muttering, "Justice is served, and reason is not extinguished." Then, they accompanied them on a tour of the Great Wall and repeatedly invited them to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat. Sure enough, these gentlemen spent a long time writing a bible for us, stating that the Northeast should be under international co-management to avoid envy. A smart person like Dr. X naturally admired this wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, this bible could not be regarded as a legal code by the Japanese side. On the contrary, they even occupied Rehe and the Great Wall exclusively, which made the gentlemen feel a sense of "past and present."</p>
<p>However, we once warmly welcomed this group and fervently hoped for it. Alas, it has all come to nothing. All for nothing!</p>
<p>But now there is another kind of investigation group coming to China. This is a group of famous writers from various countries led by France's Henri Barbusse. Although this group is not as high-profile as the former, and there is even very little publicity for them in the newspapers, we still know a little about these celebrities. Isn't it so? They are all vanguards of anti-war efforts, and they are continuing their difficult anti-imperialist mission with the support of the vast masses around the world. Barbusse once told us before the International Anti-War Congress last year: "The Japanese aggression in the Far East has been agreed upon by the European and American powers for the purpose of securing the division of China. The beginning of the Japanese imperialist's antagonistic relationship with the Manchurian hunting dog is clearly aimed at the Soviet Union at the same time." He also said: "The war is about to come again, and you can see this through the smoke screen in front of you. The words spent by those actors on the tricks of peace and disarmament are completely nonsense." From these words, we can clearly see their common goal: to oppose Japan's occupation of the four northeastern provinces and to oppose the powers' division of China. At the same time, a new war is about to begin, and he has exposed the illusion of peace for us.</p>
<p>So what will they do when they come to China? Naturally, they will not write a bible, because they are not spokespersons for powerful countries. What they must do is to investigate the tragic state of China being invaded and to educate the Chinese people to understand the "national crisis" in the meaning of anti-imperialism, so as to recover the lost territories of the Northeast through a revolutionary national war.</p>
<p>Therefore, this group is completely different from the Lytton group. Let us welcome these friends of peace with loud shouts!</p>
<h3>Visiting</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>I went to bed too late last night, and this morning, when I was enjoying a good sleep, I was being called in a low voice by my ear. I opened my sleepy eyes, and Fei made a face at me and said, "Sleepy pig, it's cool in the morning. Get up and go see your friend."</p>
<p>"Miss, a poor ghost living in a third-class ward doesn't have this right!" I turned over and got up, pushing her to sit on the chair at the writing desk and handing her today's Shenbao, and went downstairs to make hot water myself.</p>
<p>After washing up downstairs, I went upstairs, and Fei was already waiting impatiently. "What are you talking about?" She pushed the Shenbao and asked me.</p>
<p>"Fei," I couldn't joke anymore, "Haven't you ever been sick? I lived in a third-class ward for three months, but I can't wait for the illness to heal. I'd rather go back home. The doctor's carelessness and the nurse's lack of attention are obvious. Even friends' visits are scheduled. From 2 to 4 o'clock every day, Fei, a person lying sick in the hospital, is always looking forward to the arrival of friends. This is a great comfort to the patient. I have experienced it myself."</p>
<p>"! There are such big rules!"</p>
<p>"Who told you to get sick when you are poor!" I replied with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Where are you going so early?" Fei superficially brought up other questions. I knew she was afraid of causing my sadness.</p>
<p>"You go to the company, I will go alone after dinner, and it's so hot."</p>
<p>"I called the company to ask for leave when I came, and I specially went to visit the third-class ward today." She said, flipping through the Shenbao boredly.</p>
<p>"Fei, let's go to the Wenmiao Park for a walk. I go there every day. Come back and have dinner nearby, and go to the hospital together, okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay!" She jumped up like a child.</p>
<p>After taking a tram for half an hour, we stepped into the gate of the hospital under the shade of a row of maple trees. Fei walked all the way and said, "It's a good place to recuperate." In a ticket-selling counter-like window hole, we signed our names and gave our confessions, and then a Miss in white led us into the third-class ward of No. XX.</p>
<p>The ugly child is the best in their mother's eyes.</p>
<p>It was a very simple bungalow with four bunks arranged, so it was suitable for recuperating patients. The window faced the hospital's garden. When we pushed the door in, four heads were all looking forward to us enthusiastically, and three were disappointed. My friend said happily, "How did you come all the way?"</p>
<p>"Your friend? Or my friend!" Fei turned around and said to me.</p>
<p>"Oh," I forgot that they had met once in my small building.</p>
<p>Fei asked about the condition and talked a few words about the situation in the hospital. The others were looking at the garden through the window.</p>
<p>"Money, how is it?" My friend asked me softly.</p>
<p>"Borrowed from Fei." I gave him four five-yuan bills, and he hesitated to take it. "What do you say when you are sick? You want to borrow from him, but he is unwilling to lend it to you!" (That was I referring to his uncle) I said the last sentence too loudly, Fei ran over and patted him on the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Quietly recuperate" Fei seemed to feel a sad aftertaste.</p>
<p>My friend glanced at her gratefully and silently took the money.</p>
<p>Sixty minutes passed quickly, and our last sentence was still "Quietly recuperate." The patient nodded unnaturally, and his voice was already so light: "Come and see me again when you have time, probably after a week I will be discharged from the hospital." We had no "words" to answer him, and silently left the third-class ward, out of the hospital gate, and waited for the returning tram under the shade of a row of maple trees.</p>

<h3>Popular Opinion</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>In our esteemed China, beset by both foreign aggression and internal strife, things are indeed in a chaotic state! The bankruptcy of the rural villages is one of the many problems. Although there is much fanfare about agricultural revival, what is the reality?</p>
<p>Despite the bankruptcy of the rural villages, the bureaucratic infighting for power and the exploitation of farmers continue unabated. Sichuan and other provinces are examples of this. Although the implementation is not yet obvious in our southern provinces, I have a question for you, sir. In my hometown, Wuxi, land taxes are currently being paid. Yesterday, I saw in the Wuxi correspondence section of this newspaper the headline: "Extra Levies." The gist is that, "In addition to the regular and supplementary taxes of the previous year, an additional clearance fee of ten cents per mu and a security donation of two cents per sheet will be levied." However, the provincial authorities have already stipulated that "supplementary taxes shall not exceed one-third of the regular tax." Yet, the supplementary tax is about to exceed the regular tax, which is clearly a violation of the provincial order. What is the explanation for this? Furthermore, fearing conflict with provincial regulations, the Magistrate of Wuxi has established a separate clearance fee collection point at the tax collection office and assigned personnel to collect it. Does this mean it is not considered a supplementary tax? Does it not violate provincial regulations? I am not clever and earnestly request your guidance, sir, for which I will be eternally grateful. I wish you</p>
<p>Health and peace,</p>
<p>He Lin</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The government (in general) can only consume and cannot produce. The expenses required for the government to perform its duties must naturally be taken from the people. The money collected from the public by the nation is called "taxes." The methods of taxation vary. Taxes that are specifically levied on wealthy people and do not affect the working masses are good taxes. Conversely, taxes that harm the people are bad taxes. Our country's current land value tax (land tax) is one of the most unreasonable taxes: It does not distinguish between the value of the land, such as residential land, farmland, or wasteland (the previously established tax codes are now completely inapplicable). It does not distinguish between the wealth of the households (it does not use a progressive system). Such a tax, even with restrictions and strict enforcement, is harmful to the people. Why not consider other new and good taxes, such as income tax, inheritance tax, business tax, residential land tax, and special taxes on all other luxury goods? Before these are implemented, will these restrictions ever be achievable? You see, without new and good taxes, the government's existing revenue is only sufficient to maintain the status quo. Without breaking these restrictions, where will the funds for expanding existing enterprises and establishing new ones come from? I am not advocating for tax increases in your county, but I believe we have an obligation to provide the money needed by the government. However, we should change the method and not disturb the working masses. On the one hand, we must find ways to prevent bad taxes. On the other hand, we must promote taxes that are fair and ideal.</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (28)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(16) Danli, don't you like me anymore?</p>
<p>Third Mistress and Li Shiqiao were at the Marie Hotel.</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao had been feeling dazed recently. This daze was not due to the bewitchment of the Third Mistress's beauty, but because his original life plan had completely lost direction. The so-called XXXX Group Federation had already been announced with great fanfare in the newspapers, but he had no idea what to do next, nor could he. Wang Hua and Chen Tianren were also becoming increasingly close, and in this relationship, it was clear that Wang Hua had usurped his role. What was most annoying was that he hadn't received a single cent yet. To maintain appearances among the activists, he couldn't reveal his poverty. In fact, he had only eaten three steamed buns for lunch this morning. By evening, his stomach was growling with hunger. He had never been able to say anything particularly exciting to the Third Mistress, and now he didn't even have the energy or inclination to speak.</p>
<p>The Third Mistress slammed the window shut with displeasure, startling him from his daze. At first, he thought the window had rattled due to the sound of artillery from Zhabei. He looked up and saw the Third Mistress's resentful face, realizing that she had become much colder towards him recently. He smiled awkwardly at her, opened his arms, hoping she would fall into his embrace, but then immediately let his hands drop. It seemed like he had some unspoken reason to please her, while also feeling like he was being too subservient. Thus, he remained silent, helpless.</p>
<p>The Third Mistress lay on the bed, smoking a cigarette, tilting her head back to exhale a puff of smoke, and then blowing it away, looking at the plain white ceiling with boredom. Suddenly, she mustered her energy, stood up, and stared at Li Shiqiao.</p>
<p>Shiqiao also stood up and put his arm around her waist.</p>
<p>"Danli, don't you like me anymore?"</p>
<p>Finally, they embraced and shared a relatively long kiss. As usual, lovers' long kisses are usually enjoyed with eyes closed, but both of them inadvertently opened their eyes, discovering a kind of melancholy distraction and mental fatigue. In any case, it was a tragic and unpleasant kiss. This kiss further confirmed the Third Mistress's boredom, and Li Shiqiao even felt an indescribable panic. He felt that the Third Mistress, whom he should have broken up with, was now someone he was afraid of losing.</p>
<p>"Brother Qiao, are you tired? Let's lie on the bed and talk," Danli said.</p>
<p>"Okay, let me undress you!" In fact, Shiqiao first took off her socks, and her fair thighs rested on his knees. He seemed to smell some fragrance from them and sniffed them a few times.</p>
<p>"Unbutton my dress!" the Third Mistress said coquettishly. Shiqiao quickly put his hand on her shoulder and unbuttoned it all the way down. "Aren't you cold?" he asked when he saw that much of her white flesh was exposed. He used his other hand to turn off the light.</p>

<h3>Hollywood: A Gathering Place for American Beggars (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xi Yun</p>
<p>The generosity of the stars has harmed them. Their daily earnings are better than hard work. "Sir, please, I'm starving. Please give me a cup of coffee." He stood at the entrance of the Paramount Studio, his clothes ragged, but his spirits were good. He was only in his thirties. There were thousands of such people in Hollywood, with cunning eyes, sorrowful tones, and aimless steps. They were impossible to get rid of and were there every day, one after another. The reputation of Hollywood stars for generosity and charity had spread throughout the United States. Beggars from all over the country had come, undeterred by the journey.</p>
<p>There were beggars at the entrance of Paramount, MGM, RKO, Pinewood, and all other film companies. Hollywood was a paradise for beggars, a gathering place for artists of begging. Some of them even sold pencils or apples, but their purpose was always begging. The stars never took their pencils or apples. Besides the film companies, there were also vagrants and beggars of all kinds gathered at the entrances of hotels, inns, and public places, wherever the stars went, reaching out their hands to plead their misery.</p>
<p>One Hollywood reporter spent several weeks investigating the lives of these beggars. Every day he went to the entrance of Paramount and saw the young beggar with shifty eyes. He gave him money every day. On the fourth day, the beggar asked him for money again. He pulled him aside and asked how much money he earned each day. At first, he refused to say. Later, the reporter gave him some more money and told him that he was not an undercover agent, so the beggar told him. It turned out that he was only twenty-nine years old but had been a professional beggar for four years. He had begged in major cities across the United States and had even been to jail a few times. But nowhere in America was as good as Hollywood. He said Hollywood was a great place. When you told them your troubles, they immediately opened their wallets. The minimum they gave was a quarter. The reporter asked him how much he could earn in a day. He said, "It's much better than working. One day I earned twenty dollars. But I don't work in one place, otherwise, they'll see through it."</p>
<p>The reporter asked him if all the stars gave him money. The beggar was very proud and said that all the stars gave him money. Gary Cooper always gave him a quarter every time he saw him. Dick Arlen was very generous. Gary Cooper sometimes gave him half a dollar. He also said that it was best to beg at the entrance of the studio because people were coming and going, and the stars, for the sake of their reputation, always gave money.</p>
<p>The reporter then went to the entrance of RKO and talked to the woman selling apples. She shouted, "Sir, Madam, buy an apple and save a poor woman." Her tone was tragic and earnest. The stars and actors of RKO, hearing her, all gave her money. A dozen actors were her regular customers. George Jessel gave her five dollars one day. Ann Harding, in addition to giving money, also gave her old clothes. The reporter chatted with her for a while and then went to hide in a quiet place to watch. In less than twenty-five minutes, five people had given her money, but no one took her apples.</p>
<p>Conrad Nagel, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, was also a star. He often met a beggar who would burst into tears as soon as he opened his mouth. He was very curious. Later, after investigating, he found out that he had learned the secret of producing tears with glycerin from an acting technique and was making a living from it.

<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "The Cohens and Kellys in Trouble"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Now that movies have become entirely commercialized, the only goal of filmmakers is to create products that cater to the public's tastes and extract profits from them. And they know very well that due to the uneven knowledge levels of the audience, it is certainly necessary to produce works that suit the tastes of upper-class audiences. At the same time, comedies that cater to low-level interests have also become a major sector in their production range. "The Cohens and Kellys in Trouble," which is currently playing at both the New Shanghai and Garden theaters, belongs to the latter type of work.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the production of this film was entirely for the "hilarious" performances of the two "old partners." Like Laurel and Hardy, they aim to make the audience laugh and splash out money from their wallets. It is said that these two gentlemen have produced many works, having traveled to Africa and Hollywood, and have managed to squeeze into the ranks of clowns. Unfortunately, I have not seen their previous works, so I have no way of knowing their achievements. However, judging from this new work, it does not seem to be very amusing. Frankly speaking, if compared to Laurel and Hardy, then it is inevitably inferior. In fact, their movements are sluggish and forced. Comparatively speaking, their staggering steps after drinking a bellyful of wine in a secret speakeasy are more authentic, but their repeated search for each other in front of the door of another bar is repetitive and contrived. In short, their jokes are stiff, mediocre, and devoid of content.</p>
<p>As for the structure of the story, it is even more empty and tasteless. Perhaps such a story was created entirely to suit their performances. In addition, there is also a bit of irrelevant romance inserted, which is naturally the complete form required by modern films. However, it is clearly too formulaic.</p>
<p>As for the directing skills, the mediocrity and banality of the play are naturally the primary responsibility of the director. However, how can a director show his skills in such a superficial story, even though the director cannot ignore the structure of the story. In short, I believe that it is difficult to find its due value in any aspect.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Splendors of Alaska"</h3>
<p>— Mi Wu</p>
<p>It is said that watching films of snowy mountains and icy seas in the scorching heat of nearly one hundred degrees can make people feel physically and mentally at ease. But for people like me, the air conditioning pipes are what truly cool me down. When "Icebound Love" was shown at the New Shanghai Theater, many people watched it, which is true. But when "The Splendors of Alaska" was shown at the Cathay Theater, very few people watched it, which is also true. But that's just a digression.</p>
<p>It seems unnecessary to say that the lives of the propertied class are mediocre, so their films have to focus on gods, monsters, birds, beasts, and the expression of natural beauty, while ignoring the real social life and social relations. This "The Splendors of Alaska" is a film that introduces the scenery of Alaska.</p>
<p>Like its title, "The Splendors of Alaska" is "The Splendors of Alaska." The director merely used the so-called "team of travelers," leading a group of sled dogs to string together "The Splendors of Alaska." Therefore, on the screen, our actors have no performance at all. They just take the dogs on ships and airplanes, from here to there, fulfilling their mission of stringing together the scenery. The director also just mediocrely introduces "The Splendors of Alaska" to the audience. So, strictly speaking, "The Splendors of Alaska" can only be regarded as a newsreel, and not a very good one at that. Even the way the film opens, using Xiangdi's English to explain the scenes in the film, is a typical newsreel style, which, when applied to ordinary films, will interrupt the continuity of the plot.</p>
<p>But "The Splendors of Alaska" does have a story after all, the so-called "completing the great journey," but what can this story ultimately tell us? The publication of Robinson Crusoe inspired the seafaring trade fever of the "British merchants" at the time. The screening of films with Africa and other colonies as the background and incorporating a lot of romance can inspire the interest of modern American "people" in developing colonies. But "The Splendors of Alaska," with its clumsy technology, fails to achieve even this goal of the producers. You should know that relying solely on the dogmatic ending of "finally completing the great journey" is completely ineffective.</p>
<h3>Rumors of the Fairbanks' Divorce</h3>
<p>— Yi Hong</p>
<p>Divorces in Hollywood are not a big deal, but this time, the split of the Fairbanks couple is no ordinary divorce case. They have been married for thirteen years and are known as an affectionate couple. One is the former queen of the film industry, and the other is the forever unchanging martial arts king. This is the best match in the hearts of movie fans.</p>
<p>Recently, the divorce between Little Fan and Big-Eyed Sister was unexpected, but since the two were young, and had to endure each other forcefully, conflicts were inevitable. If it's Man and Van, they can both be called people of the past in terms of romance, and they have always lived apart, which should increase affection. Therefore, when the unfortunate news came, the public was in an uproar, which goes without saying. It is said that the initiative in this matter came from Mary. The reason Mary gave was that "due to irreconcilable differences, there is no need to maintain the name of husband and wife." If this case is brewed into a reality, then the trip to the Far East by the couple will become a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>According to the film supplement of the Shanghai Daily dated June 28 of this year, there is an article entitled "The Reappearance of Small Companies." The content roughly states: "In order to maintain the future of domestic films, the central government has drafted a special method and issued a 'Temporary Permit for Public Screening of Domestic Films Not Yet Approved,' with a term of six months (from June 15 to December 15 of this year). All domestic films, whether they have been screened or not, and all those that have been banned, can enjoy this preferential treatment." This is astonishing! In order to consider the difficulties of businesses and protect domestic films, this committee has repeatedly considered the relatively immature and nonsensical productions of small companies, but there has been no definite solution. As for the films that have already been banned, there is absolutely no room for compromise. The news of the "special method" reported in the newspaper is unfounded. Fearing that it will confuse the public, we have written to your newspaper with the facts, asking you to publish it in the film section so that the public can know the truth and avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully to the Shanghai Daily Film Supplement</p>
<p>Film Censorship Committee, July 14.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The article "The Reappearance of Small Companies" published in this supplement on June 28 was an external submission. We published it because the facts it presented seemed very plausible. Now that we have received a letter from the Film Censorship Committee explaining the truth, we hereby make a correction.</p>
<h3>Film Novel "Gold Diggers of 1933" (Part 3)</h3>
<p>— Dian Dian</p>
<p>The agreed time for payment arrived, but Platte was still late. The sound of repeated knocking brought in many men and women wanting to work. Hawkins and the other singers and dancers were getting impatient. Many of the women were about to leave when the door suddenly opened with a bang, and Platte walked in. Platte apologized for keeping them waiting, but instead of taking out the money, he said he wanted to play the piano. Hawkins's eyes turned to Polly. Polly said awkwardly to Platte, "How can that be fun?" Hawkins ran to the door and said he was going to lock the door, telling everyone to leave. Platte was confused and said, "Don't you want that stupid money anymore?"</p>
<p>Platte pulled out a full leather bag, counted out the new bills one by one, and handed them to Hawkins, saying, "Fifteen thousand—cash." Hawkins took the money as if he were mesmerized, looking at the young man in disbelief. Polly was overjoyed. Her pair of watery, charming eyes stared at Platte, with deep affection that went beyond words.</p>
<p>The singers and dancers who had been discouraged for a long time began rehearsing again, their spirits refreshed. They had been fooled once more. Platte also participated in the rehearsals every time. The songs he composed were very moving. Hawkins expressed great admiration for him and wanted to ask him to perform, but he shook his head. The young man was a bit strange. She took out a newspaper for Polly to see. The newspaper reported: "A clerk from the Duranto Bank stole $20,000 and disappeared." She warned Polly not to fall in love with the unreliable young man, so as not to get implicated. Polly, however, did not suspect anything, but said that she would talk to him to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>During dinner, Polly asked Platte if he had been to Duranto. He said he had, and Polly suddenly felt terrified. Polly was about to continue speaking when Platte suddenly said that he had an appointment and hurriedly left, saying "Sorry." Polly sat alone, lost in thought, but still did not suspect him.</p>
<p>On the opening night of the song and dance troupe, the theater was brightly lit. Men and women dressed in evening gowns arrived together. The backstage was very tense. The singers and dancers were busy dressing up. The orchestra was tuning their stringed instruments. The stage manager suddenly ran to Hawkins and said that the male lead, Tong En, had fallen ill and could not perform. Hawkins ran to the dressing room and saw that Tong En was helpless. Turning around, she caught sight of Platte and frantically told him the situation, insisting that he take the stage, otherwise, the opening night would have to be canceled.</p>
<p>The bad news spread like wildfire. All the singers and dancers surrounded Hawkins and Platte, listening intently. Platte resolutely refused. The group of voluptuous women were disappointed and scattered in twos and threes. Terri suddenly stood up, grabbed Platte, and said that no matter what the reason, no matter if he was going to jail after performing tonight, he must perform tonight. The success or failure of tonight was related to everyone's lives, and the happiness of everyone's future was in his hands.</p>
<p>Platte scrutinized Terri and gazed at Polly's charming eyes. Then he said that he didn't think that way, but he could give it a try. Platte's promise caused a thunderous cheer. Hawkins urged the stage manager to quickly dress him up. Polly told him that his action was truly admirable and lovable and that no matter what happened, she loved him! Platte grabbed her jade arm. Polly told him to talk about it after tonight, and her cherry lips touched his. Platte said he understood. They shared a hurried kiss before he went out to perform. The performance was truly a sensation, and the entire theater was filled with applause. Everyone asked who the male lead was, and the journalists scrambled to find out.</p>
<p>The next day, Platte's photo was on the cover of the newspaper. The news was headlined in large letters. Polly and Kai Le saw it and read the newspaper side by side. The newspaper said:</p>
<p>"Platte Roberts is the alias of Platte Ford, from a prominent Boston family. He specialized in music at the Stephen Institute of Music and has been living near Broadway under an alias for a long time."</p>
<p>Terri said she had known that the young man had a mysterious background for a long time. Polly turned her face and blamed her for suspecting that he was not a good person, but her heart was so happy that her lips trembled. (To be continued)</p>
