<p>九一八二週年沉痛紀念</p>
<h3>九一八事變之第二週年</h3>
<p>九一八事變。今已至第二週年之紀念日。在去年第一次週年紀念時。言論界一致悲憤致詞。以爲國難至此。國人應爲最後之犠牲。作根本之努力。以爭國家之生命。其尤激切者。乃曰（倘不舉全國之人力物力。以最大之决心。爲死裹求生之奮鬥。則國人雖曰中國不亡。强敵必有亡之之術。）一年前若</p>
<p>干出版物之九一八週年紀念詞。國人今日倘能檢出而誦讀之。更以之與目前時局之嚴重形勢。一爲對照。則吾知欲哭無涙者。必大有其人矣。</p>
<p>在最近一週年中。强敵武力之侵略。巳告一段落。今方轉變其侵略之方</p>
<p>向。以求於政治之控制。外交之脅迫。達其最後之目的。而從另一方面觀察。塘沽恊定成立以後。中國九分之一之領土十六分之一之人民。完全劃出於五千英方里非武裝區域以外。國人即欲爲最後之犠牲。作根本之努力。亦有所阻障而無由着手。然則吾人今日。更能作何詞以相勗勉乎</p>
<p>雖然。國人倘能眞正認識九一八事變以來中國國難之嚴重性者。則奮</p>
<p>鬭之方向。不當限於東北之局部。不當拘於失地之收復。而應就整個中華民族之生存問題中。求奮鬭之途徑。目前狂風怒潮。已侵及整個中華民族之生命。數月以來。日本對於中國國家之行動。以狂言相威脅派要員作監視。事實彰彰。如列目前。整個國家主權。已成敵人第二步侵略之目的物。全部國土與全體人民。亦即被籠罩於此强敵第二步侵略行動之下。國人雖欲不奮鬭亦有所不能。凡一民族。在受人宰割之時。而不能出其全力以反抗者。其應有之結果。各種亡國痛史中。歷歷明記之。似不待吾人之煩引而已爲國人所熟知矣。</p>
<p>相與勗勉激勵之詞。吾人於國難第一週年時。已盡爲攄述。其所發生之効力。可以一年來國難日益增重之事實。爲反面之例證。今屆國難之第二週年紀念。更拾陳言。似可不必。茲謹以簡單之一語相詢。曰（國人尙有鬭志乎。）</p>
<h3>九一八兩週年祭　偉。</h3>
<p>歳月最易從頽廢因循與善忘者之眼前流過。慘痛之九一八。於今瞬屆兩週年。兩週年云者。即東北半壁山河之變易顔色巳兩週年。東北三千萬同胞之沉溺水火已兩週年。吾人身受宰割之痛巳兩週年。在今日我全國各地。黨然亦照例有沉痛之紀念會。然而幕上燕子。不知自危。悠悠歳月。瞬息過去。兩年來我人固曾有若何之實踐行動。曾有若何之準備計劃。曾有若何之反省與覺悟。在今日興其紀念過去。母寗檢視現在。若其無之。則吾人爲當前悲哀之不暇。正無暇爲過去哀。有爲刀爼。我爲魚肉。及今不謀。茲後更寗堪設想。值茲三週年時。吾人尙可照例紀念。更三數年後。恐即欲照例紀念。而亦不可得矣。</p>
<p>吾人迴溯自九一八禍　爆發以至今日。國難與時俱增。當九一八禍變爆發之際。正值我長江流域洪水爲災。日本乘我危急。於痛肉上復加以利刃。去歳（九一八）一週年時。災後瘡痍。旣未平復。日本之侵略。且變本加厲。大好河山。淪陷更多。迄於今日。日本雖已暫停其侵略之步。武而長城以北。已不復爲我所有。黄河流域。且又告水災。舊創未平新痛又至國難之與時俱增實由人謀之不臧。乃成今日每况愈下之局。膽前顧後。誠令人痛心悲憤而莫能自已。</p>
<p>又憶當九一八禍變爆發之初。我舉國上下。固亦曾一度激昻慷慨。若將奮發有爲者。政府當軸。無不悲憤填膺。再四沉痛昭示國人以抗日救國。在我人民方面。則東北義勇軍亦如火如荼。募欵輸助。爭先恐後。然而迄今纔兩年。義勇軍雖奮鬥猶昔。而輸助寥落矣。抗日之聲。寂焉不可再聞矣。奇恥鉅痛。人所决不能忘决不忍忘者。我竟悠然若無其事。我民族其眞爲善忘之民族乎。今當軸又以充實國力效勾踐之忍辱負重及生聚敎訓昭示國人矣。是說也誠爲自助自救之正路。然而以昔例今。吾人又不勝其長夜漫漫之疑慮。今日生聚敎訓之說。又安知將來不仍爲苟且偷安耶。猛獅沉睡。酣夢不醒。重創鉅恥。已越兩年。而政治紛擾猶是。人民苟安猶是。一切無組織無計劃之狀態無不猶是。則吾人今後之希望。不將亦猶是耶。</p>
<p>雖然。往者逝矣。徒然之責備。與徒然之紀念。要都爲毫無意義。都不能挽</p>
<p>救過去旣成之事實。一言以蔽之。吾人與其哀悼過去。母寗握定現在。惟現在乃最可靠。如臥薪嘗膽。如生聚敎訓等。舉凡一切發奮圖强之昭示。與夫一切沉痛警策之誓語。則都請以現在爲始。以現在爲陳死新生之界石。亡羊補牢。尙非絶無可爲。吾人默察時勢。願竭誠貢其一得之見。</p>
<p>其一、今日當軸主張安内以攘外。然内將何由而安。此固非徒口說所可致之者也。吾人以爲禍亂之源。不在於人心之好亂。而在乎政治與經濟。政治不克上正軌。即吏治不能清明。苛捐雜稅加於民。而民無所逃死。此政治直接之影響也。農村以資本主義經濟之侵略。封建形式之剥削。與夫天災人禍之頻加。而日趨破產。都市之新興工業。又以農村破產而亦日即於凋敝。失業之羣。飢餓之衆。至於無可數計。民旣無以爲生。自不能不相率挺而走險。此又經濟直接之影響也。故今日而日安内。在政治上必痛自革新。昭示萬民以誠信。一切自大處着眼。不粉飾。不虚僞。踐實以行。行皆依軌。肅官箴以正綱紀。明是非以樹威信。减苛稅以舒民困。一切設施。悉秉光明平允之態度。夫然後政乃爲正。亦乃得治。而在經濟上則又必以有計劃之行動。以至大至誠之决心。扶植工農之發展。嚴禁鴉片。嚴禁巧立名目之榨壓。即引用外資。借用外國技術人材。亦必以有利於民爲原則。政旣得正。經濟亦能步上復興之途。夫然後民生乃得蘇甦。社會秩序乃得穏定。而亂乃得平。匪乃得滅。内乃能安。而棧（安内以攘外）之意旨。乃能實踐。此其一也。</p>
<p>其二、日本之攫取我東北。人皆曰是無異於呑下一炸彈。然而此一炸彈。彼旣已呑下矣。東北之富源。即無異於日本之外府矣。東北之山河。即無異於日本之屏障矣。而彼之野心。猶未饜也。取我鞍山之鐵。以實軍需。取我撫順之煤。以充燃料。取我山積之高梁大豆。以裕糧蒭。取我所有。即以禍我。故彼攫取我東北後。實力益充。野心益肆。而在環境上。則矛盾又日益加深。更不得不以戰爭爲唯一解决矛盾之道。今彼之軍費。較去歳又激增矣。更積極從事於軍備之擴張矣。其高呼東亞門羅主義。又何爲者。故吾人慎勿以爲日本旣得東北。目的巳達。慾望巳滿。决不至再越長城而南。而不預爲籌謀。作事先之策劃。瞑目以待其宰割。往事不忘。後事之師。來日大難。吾人亟應作未雨之綢繆。此其二也。</p>
<p>其三、不僅東鄰之積極侵略。亟應預防巳也。遠東之局勢。今亦巳入於風狂雨驟之險局。由於日本之攫取東北。而太平洋上各國。亦劍拔弩張。怒目相向。美日之競造軍艦。與軍費之加速增大事。至顯然。即日本蘇聯之間。亦時呈山雨欲來風滿樓之勢。遠東戰禍。巳迫近眉睫。所等待者。不過爲更充分之準備。一旦戰禍爆發。我旣不能閉闗自守。置諸不聞不間。復無力以自衛自救。則惟有旋轉於慘毒之浪潮中。土地供人作戰塲。人民供人作奴役。原料任人取給。一切都聽人支配。聽人蹂躪。斯時之慘毒。更不堪設想。我民族將由是而陷</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>入萬刦不復之深淵。故吾人今日而言自衛自救。則又不應僅着目於東鄰。未來遠東戰禍之如何應付。亦爲今日急應籌謀之一事。此其三也。總之。吾人今日紀念九一八。應都先一默思。先一反省。紀念果何爲。若徒爲點。綴徒爲照例。徒爲感想之哀悼。則紀念爲徒然。爲毫無意義。而一週不如一週。吾人亦惟有靜待同歸於盡而巳耳。若其不然。則陳死新生。請即自今日始。少說空話。埋頭實幹。明年今日。庶幾吾人之紀念。不徒爲無力之呻吟。與流涙痛哭之可憐相。語云。天助自助者。我民族今後之命運。即在於吾人今日之奮鬥與準備。</p>
<h3>兩年來的回顧與展望</h3>
<p>丨東北三省失陷的前因後果丨</p>
<p>日本侵略東三省。巳經是歷史上的事實。自從清日甲午戰爭以後。日本奪占了高麗。即積極準備進攻東三省。旣至一九○五年日俄戰爭。日本得到勝利。於是日本不但奪取了俄國在南滿從中國方面所强占的權利。並且擴大了牠在南滿路沿綫的經濟勢力和政治勢力。例如撫順的煤炭。鞍山的　　。本溪湖的紡織。以及南滿路沿綫的駐兵。奉天省城的開　商埠。吉長鐵路的延長到朝鮮的會寗。都是日本帝國主義者侵略東三省很顧明的事實。這些事實。在滿清時代一般所謂王公大臣旣不明瞭敵方形勢。也不曉得自己的地位。所以日俄兩國在中國境内打仗。還在說風凉話守中立。民國成立以。後我们中國的民族資本漸次發達。但是地方軍閥對於國家。對於民族。依然没有正確的認識。在東三省境内。雖然痛感外力的壓迫。他们却還是不肯抛棄個人的利益以成全民族革命的歷史使命。</p>
<p>不過東三省境内民族資本的發展是不可湮滅的。所以奉海鐵路和洮昻鐵路都由中國資本建築成功。這是一種必然的趨勢。同時也足以威脅日本帝國主義者。使牠在東三省的所謂特殊利益從根本上發生動摇。這時的英美情勢與今略有不同。因爲英美資本主義巳經到達較高度的發展。殖民地半殖民地的新興資本還不足以和牠们競爭。日本雖然號稱作帝國主義國家。具有金融資本獨占的形態。但是牠的主要產業還是纎維工業。其輸出製造品中以纎維製品爲第一。因此東三省經濟的發達很足使日本恐懼。不幸在政治上。東三省舊日當局並不理解這種闗係。自己在政治上並不曾有什麽準備。僅具有一些不健全的對日惡感。所以一旦有事件發生。就毫無自衛的方法。</p>
<p>尤其明顯的是民國二十年六月。内田康哉任滿鐵總裁。宇垣一成任朝鮮總督。日本軍部又曾露骨表示牠將有積極的圖謀。當時東三省當局如果能夠動製機先。未嘗不能夠制止日本軍國主義者的軍事行動。東三省這塊地還有保持完整可能。不料他们因循坐誤。一直等到九一八晚上的炸彈爆發。纔驚惶起來。說是國難臨頭了。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義者突然發動軍事行動。那是無論誰都承認這是一種侵略的行爲。撕毁國際間一切公約。破壞國際間一切信義。然而何以我们的東三省竟至不能收回。而日本則得步進步旣占據了東三省又攻打熱河。而且得到相當的成功。這是什麽道理呢。過去兩年的事實。我们所得的敎訓是。第一我们中國民族確實有點衰老了。對於當前這樣强的敵。人有的未免輕視。有的是過度畏懼。在自身又只是着重於個人的發展。儘量表現個人的長處。對於集體的發達。特别是整個民族的活動。旣不整肅。也没有眞正有力的表現。東北三省的義勇軍。曾有過轟轟烈烈的鬥爭。可惜都祗是一面。而處在後方安全地帶。則行其所無事似的。决不像正在生死存亡的鬥爭期中的狀態。僅祗一二八戰爭當時。上海附近確是有戰時情况。但是不久又恢復酣歌曼舞的故態。這雖然一件小事。好像不甚重要。在敵方看來。却從此偵察出我们國民的性格。從此作出對付我们的種種計劃。第二是政策上到底是戰是和並没有堅决的决定。講到戰。因爲我國的國力薄弱。民生凋敝。財力不夠對外戰爭。而就地抵抗的辦法。以地方上一部分的軍力。當然不能和人家運用整個國力相比拚。所以結果。是天天聽到打勝仗。可是天天在縮短戰線天。天失陷土地。第三在此困難的局勢。中我们還有一個大吃虧的所在。就是過於看重國聯。以爲國聯有斷然裁制日本的權力。並且以爲國聯會員國中如英如法的實際利益。都不免和日本衝突。人事方面。各國的代表。又都與中國表好感。我们就以爲道是對日的辦法。然而當世各國。如美國確與日本處於對立地位應該能夠抑制日本的。但是牠正困於經濟恐慌。自身的難闗且不能打破。又那裹有實力來帮中國對付日本。至於國際聯盟本來是一個空的道德機闗。而且爲五大常任理事國所操縱的機闗。牠决無實力來裁制任何强國的軍事暴行。這是世所共知的事實我们絶不能希望在這種地方去講理。即使講理而得直。也是無法可施的事。何况英日兩國對東北事件在前有多少諒解呢。因此遷延復遷延。等到日本帝國主義佈置完備。國聯旣無實力阻止。我们中國便是無可奈何。凡是自己没有實力而希望别人援助。終究是不會有結果。的這回東三省問題訴諸國聯的事即其一例。</p>
<p>國際的形勢。因爲世界經濟恐慌的加深。資本帝國主義各國間的對立也就愈見激烈。特别是爲了分割遠東市塲而引起的糾紛。在日本方面以爲旣得志於（滿洲。）耀武於華北。則轉進而席捲長江流域。甚至侵略到澳洲。而菲利濱闗島。那更是牠囊中之物。了不特此也。日本還想越過香港。跨進南洋羣島。穿過新嘉坡而獨占印度市場。因爲兩年來强占東三省的結果。並不能達到日本原來的奢望。解决日本帝國主義當前的經濟恐慌。並且爲了用兵的原故。反而增加了日本一般人民的担負。致日本農村負債。每一農户有一千圓日金以上。日本的軍國主義。對此並不曾覺悟到以前種種是牠自己的錯誤。反而還以爲那是牠的侵略手段。不曾到家。兵力還不夠用。同時更以爲大陸政策還不滿意。因此要另伸一隻手向海洋方面去。所以牠明年度的預算。海軍的擴張費特别大。其數目有六億八千萬日金。</p>
<p>在這種情勢之下。澳洲。新西蘭。印度。南洋羣島。都感受莫大的威脅。並且不止是經濟上貿易的優勝而巳。還會使英國對以上諸地統治發生根本的動摇。同時美國要開發遠東市場必然要碰見日本海軍的鐵掌。並且菲利濱這塊地。也不免遇見絶大的危險。美國之竭力擴張海軍和艑空隊。那是管然中之當然的事了。再有一方面是日本大陸政策所指向的西伯利亞。在名義上和事實都是英美諸國所喜的。封鎖蘇聯。進占西伯利亞。單就陸軍而論。日本好像是有把握。但是西伯利亞萬里平原。幾十萬以至百萬的軍隊擺在那裹。也不見得有多大的作用。何况現在的蘇聯。巳經和從前不同。日本如果敢於再度冒險。則必然會要碰見鐵冷的敎訓。</p>
<p>可是日本得了戰爭的狂熱病。縱然遇見了太平洋沿岸諸國最低限度和平的敎訓。但牠並不曾有絲毫覺悟的表示。而且還更步加緊牠的侵略行爲。例如在闗東軍司令部中設立經濟參謀部。把東三省境内日軍改爲常駐師團。擴張梅軍建艦計劃。三年之内建築航空母艦及巡洋艦。驅逐艦。潛水等合計三十三艘。還有航空隊八隊。這樣的表示。誰相信牠口頭的和平表示。在這樣緊急闗頭。敵方正在一步緊一步的逼進來。我们能夠忘去巳失的東三省嗎。能夠再忽視敵方的進攻政策嗎。能夠不亟起自衛嗎。當然我们知道對日本的闗係。决不是短時期内所能了結。在事實上必然成爲一種歷史的。經常的民族争鬥。這種偉大的民族爭鬥。如果還和從前一樣。僅祗運用個人的能力。則最後的勝利依然不會有把握。必須努力於集體的組織與鍜鍊工作。把衰老的民族性。從爭鬥的鍜鍊中練出新的活力。奮我们自己的活力。運用集體的行動。和巳近崦議的軍國主義者搏戰。則最後的勝利。必然是我们的。</p>

<p>對我誘使諒解</p>
<p>對俄解决懸案</p>
<p>定明日出席閣議說明</p>
<p>（東京）廣田新外相將於十九日之閣議、對於日外交所進取之方針、陳述其抱負經綸、以求各閣員之諒解、由是以廣田新外相之所謂躍進的外交爲目標而邁進也、然廣田外相所懷抱之外交政策、對於一九三五年外交之危機、爲有效之準備工作者、乃依下列之根本方針、謀外交之强化、觀夫廣田新外相邇來之說明、即可明瞭也、</p>
<p>充實國力在一九三五年外交危機之際、於貫澈日帝國之主張上、其唯一之方法、爲國防計畫之完成、國家經濟之充實、以及輿論之統一案、洵爲現政府最緊要之事也、</p>
<p>對滿政策係積極的援助（滿洲國）之經濟建設與門户開放、此爲對於一九三五年之最有效對策、</p>
<p>對華政策一九三五年不僅爲日本外交之危機、甚且藏有遠東政局破綻之危險、然日本外交對於中國、不可固執靜觀主義、此際一面認對華之嚴正靜觀主義、同時努力避免一九三五年之遠東危局、應力說此爲位置於遠東國家之共同責任、且勸說確立中（滿）兩國之闗係、向打開遠東目下之不安邁進爲必要、</p>
<p>對英美俄策對英美俄不可玩弄小策、以待機講求相互間促進和平之根本策爲原則、尤以對於美國、避免相互無益、如剌戟敵對感情之工作、謀通商之緊密、并應一掃介乎兩國間之戰爭不安、對於英國、則於近將開會之西姆拉會議、以恢復相互主義的互惠待遇爲根本要求、始終向交涉妥恊努力進行、由互讓以調整在英帝國市塲之日英通商競爭、對俄慫恿北鐵交涉之圓滿妥恊、以此爲出發點、進行解决日俄（滿）三國闗係和平之一切懸案、但對於俄國於世界政局之一二行爲、若爲近視眼之親俄政策、必須慎重考慮者也、</p>
<p>南美其他新市場政策努力調整與舊市塲之通商闗係、同時將日本貿易政策之重點、置於獲得新市塲、增加與中南美·菲洲·南洋等之經濟親善闗係、（十七日電通電）</p>

<p>廣田欺世之談廣田外相談曰、凡批評一切問題、須要經過若干時期、前年九月十八日柳條溝事件勃發、而見（滿洲國）之獨立、而至日本退出國聯、現已經過兩年、日本與各國以冷靜態度、考慮滿洲問題、若於兩年前、世界人民能維持如今日之冷靜態度、則世界不必經過無謂之迂迴曲折而可了事、以維持現狀爲國際間最高正義者係形式論也、由滿洲社會之自衛本能發端之（滿國）獨立、獲得以維持遠東和平爲主義之日本本態的援助、是即東亞全局之自力更生運動也、故以冷靜的眼光觀望、則可知中日兩國毫無爲（滿洲國）相爭之理由、（滿洲國）高揭王道主義之大旗、從事各種建設、其產生决非中日兩國間之溝渠、寗係使兩國連帶闗係更爲緊密之橋樑也、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>荒木迷信武力（東京）荒木陸相之談話如下、滿洲事變發生後巳經兩年、余信此兩年對於日（滿）兩國意義最重大、兩國現在緊密聯接、實行遠東和平之使命、滿洲國内武力工作雖告一段落、然確保完全治安、尙要多大努力、日本又有防備外敵之義務、故應有不屈任何困難之覺悟、然吾人此覺悟、决非排他的、係建設自己之精神也云（十七日日聯電）</p>

<h3>孫科談全國經委會今後工作</h3>
<p>注重改良國產米麥與棉紗</p>
<p>復興農村經濟與江西匪區</p>
<p>立法院院長孫科氏、昨日上午十時、在哥倫比亞路私邸、接見各報社記者、談及全國經濟委員會今後工作之目標、頗爲詳盡、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3>經濟組織棉麥支配</h3>
<p>據孫氏談、全國經濟委員會之組織章　　程、尙須經過立法手續、並不十分擴大、經委會今後工作之目標、注重於改良國產之米麥與棉紗、復興農村經濟與江西匪區、至於美棉美麥支配之原則、早經决定、惟具體辦法、尙須經過專家研究之後、始能决定、</p>
<h3>研究改良國產米麥</h3>
<p>我國原係農業國家、糧食足以自給、惟年來洋米洋麥巨額進口、以致國產之米麥銷路阻塞、價格低落、農村經濟、幾瀕破產、其原因在於（一）米市組織不良、粤桂各地米高、多向安南及暹羅定米、蓋取其運輸便利、米質優良、價格低廉、及交貨有定期也、是故長江一帶、雖屬產米之區、反致銷路阻塞、洋米得以傾銷、（二）洋麥質凈量多、運價便宜、、滬津麥商多樂購之、（三）海闗對於糧食進口、素不徵稅、目的在於救濟糧食缺乏、不意洋米洋麥、因此得以傾銷於中國内地、國產米麥反遭打擊、農村經濟、因而破產、財政部最近釐訂新稅則之時、對於洋米洋麥之進口、决予徵稅、藉以救濟華米華麥、但以粤方反對、迄未實行、中央對於救濟國產米麥、早經調查、予以調劑、如减低運價等等、至於根本方法、則在改良國產米麥、此項責任、將由全國經濟委員會負之、研究改良國產米麥、制止洋米洋麥進口、以求農村經濟之復興、</p>
<h3>拯救我國紡織工業</h3>
<p>其次爲棉紗紡織之改良、亦爲目下重要問題、我國年來　　雖以農村衰落、致購買力薄弱、百業不振、但日常服用、仰給舶來品、所值甚鉅、布疋一項、每年進口、約值數萬萬元、國商紗廠、雖有一部份之出產、究不足以應全國之需求、且以國廠旣仰求於外棉之供給、又因其本身組織之不健全、故在此世界經濟恐慌之激潮中、隨時有失敗之危險、况各國廠商、尤以其雄厚之資力、鉅量之生產、而作有計畫之傾銷、以我爲消納之尾閭耶、此即我紗織業所受多方之壓迫、更因紗業之衰落、而使一般農民從事棉作者、不能銷售產品、而形成農村經濟之破敗、故其影響所及、非僅纺織一業、且爲整個社會之問題也、現經濟委員會、亦將加以研究、以拯救此紡織工業、</p>
<h3>江西匪區急待復興</h3>
<p>此後復興農村工作、將從贛省匪區入手、應根據過去復　　興匪區失敗之經騐、研究一補救辦法、溯共黨自在贛武裝、巳達五六年、而中央大畢包剿、亦有三四年、而迄未得澈底消滅、窮探其源、在共黨乘贛省經濟不良狀况下、竊用民生主義平均地權方法、將土地没收、實行耕者有其田辦法、故農民雖在共黨壓迫及恐怖狀態下、亦表歡迎、今後吾人當感政府前定經濟政策之南轅北轍也、最近中央軍克復匪區、即以收復土地歸還原主、招人認領、殊不知地主被殺、固巳不能復生、出走者决不願即行歸來、而當局遽將已分配於農民者、突然收回、農民失耕、土地聽其荒蕪、民心不附、無異一種自殺政策、授共黨以隙、實爲政府疏忽、現當局者已有覺悟、本人意見、政府可令災區農民仍佔用耕地、承認已成事實、更免納年賦三年、實行放欵、調劑物價、疏通貨運、如食鹽布疋必需品、由政府採購、平價出售、共黨勢力至此未有不消滅者、故闗係救濟農村、爲物力人材闗係、多數意見、將由江西匪區入手、</p>
<h3>日本對華政策不變</h3>
<p>日本内田外相此次辭職、委任前駐俄大使廣田繼任、日　　本對華政策之有無變更、頗爲全世界人士所注目、據本人觀察、日本外相雖有更迭、對華政策、則一仍其舊、繼續其壓迫之政策、不減其侵略之野心、至於第五次全國代表大會展緩召開與否、尙待中央常會决定、現尙未定云、</p>
<h3>實業部解釋商會主席常委應重選</h3>
<p>實業部據各省市商會電詢商會改選、未被籖抽任之常務委員或主席、其資格是否存在、抑須一律另選、昨特指令云、查商會主席及常委、均　執行委員之一、改選時期其主席或常委縱未被抽籖去職、但執行委員會組織已變更、自應另由新舊執監委員重行推選、</p>

<p>籃球</p>
<p>夏光勝江灣（男）</p>
<p>崇德克海星（女）</p>
<p>曁南挫青白（男）</p>
<p>昨晚籃球、觀者不多、夏光以五十五比二十一勝江灣、上半時頗爲緊張、下半時則爲一面倒第二塲女子比賽、崇德活潑善戰前呼後應、相形益彰、以三十八比十二勝海星、曁南以細膩之工作、以五十七比二十八克青白、</p>
<h3>夏光勝江灣（男）</h3>
<p>夏光全軍動員恢復舊有陣綫、戰門力殊强、江灣有如草莽英雄、雜亂無章惟雄心勃勃、不稍示弱、分庭抗禮、形勢激烈、江灣先發制人、先得五分、夏光胸有成竹、不稍慌張、任傑星神出鬼没、屢有苗中、江灣抵雖嚴、投籃不中、局勢則散漫紊亂、殊少興趣、上半時夏光十九分、江灣十二分下半時雙方犯規累累、而江灣愈形不支、夏光則益見得勢、任傑星得分甚多、全隊聯絡尙佳、工作緊張、成爲一面倒之形勢、結果夏光以五十五比二十一勝、當五十一比二十一時、江灣張錦祥四次犯規出塲後、替補無人、只以四人作戰、敷衍了結、</p>

<h3>崇德勝海星（女）</h3>
<p>海星雖　有陳英瑞郭筱萍及自北平來滬之周賢言令妹周賚等均因不彈此調已久、草草組合、自難有良好表演、致爲後起新軍崇德所敗、崇德隊員、嬌小玲壠、作戰頗有格局、防守嚴密、投籃準確、前鋒三人、球藝平均、故能呵成一氣表演美妙技術　海星相形見拙、一籌莫展、總結果崇德以三十八比十二勝、</p>

<h3>曁南勝青白（男）</h3>
<p>青白隊　爲前青光與持　志校友之混合隊、以論人材、均　上流之選、但論戰鬥、則未見高明、曁南則工作細膩、頻上軌道尹貴仁韓振元二人、尤見出色、新加入前大同大學名將王渭溪、助長其戰門力不少、論局勢則韓振元爲開紀錄、青白余邵子還報一球、自此曁南節節前進、成八比二、青白追成八比八此爲最緊張之時期、亦青白之全盛時代、但從此以後、青白一蹶不振、全爲曁商　兒之世界直至二十四比八、青白首獲一球、上半時終了、曁南以三十比十二勝、下半時局勢無變化、青白始終屈居人下、挽回乏術、結果曁南五十七分、青白二十八分、</p>

<h3>足球</h3>
<p>曁南大敗飛公</p>
<p>優游痛擊零隊</p>
<p>均一面倒形勢</p>
<p>昨日足球、共兩塲比賽、均爲一面倒之形勢、曁南以十六比零大敗飛公、優游以六比一擊退零隊、查零隊爲青年之化身、爲中華足球會中字組會員、實力尙可、但動作未免過火耳、</p>
<p>曁南克飛公　曁南先戰飛公、如風捲殘雲、局勢一面倒飛公者、飛花同業商人所組織之新旅也、精氣神力、四者俱未勝人焉經身經百戰之曁南鐵騎所摧折耶、欲其不敗、亦情理中所不許之事也、然則飛公以一弱小民族、毅然抱大無畏精神、奮鬥到底、可謂臂當車、恥猶不辱、雖以十六對零敗北、猶值得我人贊許也、</p>

<h3>中國游泳研究會主辦渡海賽成功</h3>
<p>史興隆獲得冠軍</p>
<p>宣傳已久之二千米高橋渡海比賽、因風浪闗係、或天不作美、屬次延期、主辦及贊助者不知用盡多少心血也、昨日又值天陰風大、浪花高至丈餘、勢必再延、然氣候漸冷而各界到塲之熱烈盼望闗係、决定　險進行、上午十時選手四十餘人、多係個中老手、技術精能者、故主辦者亦故心從事、齊集海　飯店、由該店楊鴻奎趙盤石二君殷勤招待、餐畢、由該會俞斌祺王建新楊偉良等發令、準備出發、救生船半打、救命圈四十餘只、由船將選手渡至二千米距離處、時在正午、鳴砲下水、五分鐘後、由史興隆一馬領前、一千米時楊元華黎日新、並駕前進、斯時浪花四濺、只見人頭水上起伏不定、誠滬上空前未見洋洋大觀、在最後之二百米、史君捷游到達終點、楊黎競爭甚烈、觀衆五六百人、同聲歡呼、全體賽員均安全迪次登陸、下午三時各選手喛、飽食後、卽由該會俞王二君報告、此次發起渡海競賽經過、及辯辦之苦心、今均獲安全、由徐仲基女士給奬、</p>

<h3>高級單打網球複賽</h3>
<p>鄭兆佳又敗　王文正得决賽權</p>
<p>四比六、七比五、三比六、六比二、六比三</p>
<p>邱飛海勝余田光一盤未終局</p>
<p>上海草地網球會男子高級單打清一色四華將昨日複賽之結果、王文正劇戰五盤、淘汰鄭兆佳、得决賽權、比數爲四比六、七比五、三比六、六比二、六比三、此爲鄭兆佳本年第二次之敗於王文正、尙有一組邱飛海對余田光邱以八比六勝余第一盤、以天晚停賽將於本星期六續賽、</p>
<h3>座客苦　比賽遲延　王文正再勝鄭兆佳</h3>
<p>以天時不佳、陰雨四合、故此重要之高級單打複賽、雖清一色全爲中華選手、觀者並不擁擠、四週散坐而已、原定二時半開賽、以鄭兆佳之不能按時出席、比賽竟延誤一小時之久、因此第二場邱余之戰、遂不能結束、座客悶坐至三時後、方見小鄭姗姗而來、而座客則大苦矣、</p>
<h3>鄭兆佳　可勝惜敗</h3>
<p>昨日之鄭兆佳、遇王文正時、較爲振作、最初上場、精力亦足、一三兩盤最見精彩、第二盤以懈怠而失去、四五兩盤、每况愈卜、不堪聞問、一敗而不可收拾、鄭兆佳不勝此重要闗鍵之第二盤、及在四五盤中、曾挽救至有一綫生機時、仍不能加緊一步、殊堪爲之惋惜、王文正則不减前態、其能始終如一、在最後一盤、於情况十分惡劣中、能奮起勝敵、亦當稱許、</p>
<h3>第一盤　戰局緊張</h3>
<p>三時半怱怱開　、鄭兆佳得先發球之權、王文正接連四記、皆觸網中、王文正發球、二人開始戰鬥、皆以對角球抽射、緊凑可觀、卒爲王得、鄭以野球送去自己之發球局、王遂以三比一居先、鄭藉王　網之錯誤、亦連勝三局、反以四比三佔優勢、各四後鄭發球、失誤一極佳之　　、使分數成平等、繼而王反佔先一記、此左右局勢之一局、正在摇摇中、王忽連接觸網三次、小鄭遂得五比四、第十局王先勝二記、又入　三次、小鄭以極佳之邊線球、以六比四得勝第一盤、</p>
<h3>王文正　苦鬥奪回</h3>
<p>緊張之第一盤方過、第二盤局勢忽轉人沉悶遲慢、鄭兆佳已不若第一盤之有力而敏速、王文正亦現疲態、鄭兆佳發球、發球者皆勝、一局復一局、直至成各四各五、鄭以苦戰得五比四、然不能破其次之一局、遂成五比五、小鄭發球、最後王以一觸帶之球擊破、一躍居先、復以七比五奪回一盤成各一局面、鄭在此盤中、時以準確對角球攻射、使王東西奔跑不已、然以出手過慢、左角一射、不能隨手再射右角、使對方得從容回復原位、如此坐失良機、爲小鄭不能得勝此盤重要原因之一、從此局面改變矣、</p>
<h3>鄭兆佳　急起直追</h3>
<p>鄭兆佳在第三盤中、似乎又突然振起、或鑒於奄奄無生氣之危險、其砰砰有力之兩角掃射、得使以二比一盤佔極優形勢、出球愈擊愈順、稱心如意、完全勝利氣概、萬料不到其末後兩盤之一敗塗地、王文正以二比一佔先、鄭以重抽勝滑局、反成三比二、四比三、最後以一觸帶球完局、王以六比三失此第三盤、小鄭果而勝第二盤、則勝負早决、休息十分鐘後、王文正突然轉機、連得二盤、亦意料不及、</p>
<h3>末兩盤　形勢大變</h3>
<p>最後之兩盤、形勢突然大變、王文正先發球、一連下得三局、生氣忽逐蓬勃勃、而鄭兆佳則把握全失、皆在線外、王文正一下三局、鄭兆佳奪回二局、第六局自己之發球局不能保持、六比二王得勝第四盤局面遂成平等、最後决賽之第五盤、小鄭仍一蹶不振、王仍先得三比零、鄭兆佳因王之脚痛、奪回三局、依然不能挽救局面、錩誤百出、又連失三局、終以六比三失此判勝負之第五盤、</p>
<h3>老邱勝小余第一盤</h3>
<p>丨八比六丨</p>
<h3>余田光　其勢洶洶</h3>
<p>卹飛海余田光之戰開始、巳五時餘、小余在意料之外、　乎　得老邱一盤先以五比二佔先　復得六比五、惜不能維持此局面余田光擊法聰明、鮮有　誤、聲東擊西、　虎離山、屢以上網殺球　效、其一記深角球後　再加以一記另一角之　球、邱飛海竟爲束手、兩角抽亦佳、余先得一局、一比一後余又得三比一、竟成五比二、老邱見勢不佳、加緊球拍、連奪三局、成五比五、余又以六比五居前、最後邱再連下三局、以八比六得勝、二人將於星期六再行續賽、</p>

<p>服裝特刊　第二期</p>
<h3>九一八與服裝　天笑</h3>
<p>衣食住行衣爲第一</p>
<p>愛國先自服裝爲始</p>
<p>（九一八）事件，已兩周年了。在這兩年中，東北義勇軍苦志奮鬭抗日，逐步的失敗，塘沽恊定的簽訂，都使我们全國國民的痛心。在瀋陽失陷了以後，全國人民，都從事於抵貨運動，但是到今天，效果又在那裹呢？所以我们應該換一種方法，先把自己的經濟力量充實，第一不要再使金錢流到外國去，盡量的採用國貨。</p>
<p>人生所需，衣食住行，衣佔第一，所以我们服用國貨，尤應先從服裝方面開始，才有頭緒，不論是布，是绸，是呢絨畢嘰，國貨中都有很好的出品，（就像美亞織綢廠的各種綢緞爲例，也勝過舶來品）而且價格比洋貨便宜，又何苦再用洋貨呢？</p>
<p>我们不必諱言，在今年這年頭兒，大家的心，又冷了不少，（提倡國貨）這句口號不常聽得了，但是使我们刻骨銘心一時一刻都不能忘不敢忘的（九一八），却已在我们扯日曆的時候，怵目警心地，給我们瞧見了。要是再不採用國貨，而把衣着日用品，一定要買洋貨，那麽金錢都到了外國，將來也許窮得連衣服都穿不起呢。</p>
<h3>衣的進化　衡平</h3>
<p>衣的進化，實就是人類對於穿衣思想的進步。初民被獸皮，裹樹葉，繫草裙，所穿的大半是天然物，這是原始的衣服。開化以後，知道用絲，麻，棉，或别的植物纖維，交織成綢和布：但是染料仍不過用自然物，如五倍子，槐米，靛藍之類。到了文化進步，知道衛生和儀表的闗係，而毛織品纔見盛行。並且從化學染料發明之後，色彩的配合，複雜而耐久。人们的穿衣，依四時寒暖早晚各種塲合而有不同。總而言之，穿衣的進化，是和人類的進化成正比例。</p>
<p>衣的屬性，可分形，色，質三面講。從顔色講：大抵野蠻人喜紅色而發亮的。聽說台灣的生番，滇桂的苗猺，都喜歡和漢商交易紅布。可是現在的城市，除一部分奇悵炫服的女子以外，愛穿大紅的人却極少。於是毛織品代興，成爲現代適宜的衣料，它的顔色，不是大紅大綠而是中間色複合色，較近平淡的了。</p>
<p>就形式講：五洲萬國，漸趨會同。中國人的衣服，除一部份人已完全改從西裝外，其餘凡在都市以及趨時尙的，大抵也漸向歐化，婦女的時裝，近來已傾向於曲線的表顯和花紋的别緻了。衣服的形式旣然歐化，原料自必求適於歐化的，所以外國毛織品便得侵入中國市塲，日增銷路。</p>
<p>末了講到質：製衣自然是毛織品最好。它紋理疎鬆，可以多含空氣，不易爲外來急激的冷熱所乘。而毛羽有彈性，穿着時外觀平直，雖受搓摺，不很捲縮，色彩又潤澤自然；所以它在美的條件中，有樸雅高尙之觀，而爲社會所愛好。</p>
<p>衣服的進化而成爲國際化，遂改變了中國人的服色；中國人服色的改變，又使國家成爲被外國毛織品感銷的尾閭，這是異常嚴重的變遷。我们檢討歷來的市塲，外國的棉織品侵入中國，逐年吸取了許多金錢去，至今愈演愈烈，使中國陷於國家的貧血症。倘此後外人的經濟侵略，漸改向毛織品進行，或是棉布人造絲並來，我们經濟的負担又是怎樣呢？我以爲這非工業家的趕緊準備和人民的扶助奬進不可，因爲人心的愛好，和時勢習尙的推移，難以逆阻，所以我们必須趕緊製造毛織品，日求精良。一方面人民要養成服用國貨認爲光榮的風氣。譬如近來上海毛織廠巳有多家，大都僅備針織，其中規模較大，技術精良能製細嗶嘰華達呢大衣呢的，端推章華呢絨廠。他的出品，駸駸乎追上舶來，價亦較廉。但在外貨傾銷的當兒，又逢不景氣的年頭，國内工業的挣扎，是十分困苦的。工業不能得政府的扶掖，我们人民便要自動起來扶掖。日本人有一種脾氣，就是凡貨物總是日本第一。萬一爲日本所無，纔用外貨。中國人也有一種脾氣，是外貨第一，凡外國的總勝本國。假如打破此種迷信，而能參加幾分救國自救的心理，那一定可以發現幾種確有一長的國貨。我於衣服的現代化，因而想到章華廠的努力，所以在這裹並樂爲介紹一下。</p>
<h3>試衣　文子</h3>
<p>中國女子做衣裳，向來只有八種尺寸（一）身長，（二）出手（三）掛肩，（四）腰身，（五）下擺（六）袖口（七）領圈（八）領高。最近才添了（一）胸圍（二）腹圍兩種，這是因爲乳部解放了以後，考究曲線美，所以胸腰腹，分了三種不同的尺寸了。</p>
<p>但是舊式裁縫將各人衣裳，照尺寸裁了去，仍不將衣服的草樣送去試穿，而西式服裝店却須經試衣的手續，才給你將衣服縫製。</p>
<p>尤其是綢衣，試樣的一個手續，是必不可少。因爲綢性柔軟，向下垂墜，要是稍有一處尺寸不準確，穿起來一定會减少美觀。譬如美亞織綢廠新近出的二二秋式糺縵縐，是最入時的衣料，我们揀了一種心愛的花樣，買回去交給裁縫，若不試樣，萬一縫製得不很稱身，不是一件遺憾麽？</p>
<p>美亞先施時裝表演會之</p>
<p>由九一八想到　　絲綢與農村經濟　元霜</p>
<p>中國女子穿國產綢緞　可養活幾千萬之農民</p>
<p>有人說：（現在農村經濟破產，全國人民的生活，是進樣困難，不應該再提倡服裝的奢侈！這句話的理由，是非常充足，我们似乎無法反對了。但是我们究竟走到農村去實地看過没有？，全國的蠶桑，已到了怎樣地步？假使你是確切知道農民因爲育蠶虧蝕的無法挽救，而把桑田都鏟掉的話；假使你是確切知道國產蠶絲在國外已到處碰壁無人購買，和國内的購買者大都穿人造絲衣料與東洋布的話，你一定不反對我们提倡用國產衣料做較美觀的服裝了。</p>
<p>我们還可以很顯明的看出，女子的消費，比男子來得多，她们的服裝費用，每年總比男子要超出一倍以上，但是她们因爲不曾知道那一種衣料，究竟是洋貨，還是國貨，所以誤買洋貨的很多，這筆流到外國去的巨欵，我们只請她们用在本國，實際上並不敎她们再增加，或者反可以减省一些（因爲國貨衣料大概很便宜）所以我们更應該提倡；並且是指導她们選擇怎樣的衣料，怎樣去裁製，是合於時代的需要而美觀，尤其她们所歡迎。</p>
<p>九一八以後，我们國家的版圖，已有一部份變色，許多金錢財產，也都被日人攫奪而去，這是極大的損失，誰都知道的了：但是我们範圍縮小一些說，單只服裝方面，國產的絲綢，運到東北去，非但受到僞國闗稅的重征，並且日貨早已排擠得我们的國產絲綢，毫無立足之點了；同時日本的衣料，却又向我们全國各地傾銷，我们只要到市面上去，日貨的衣料，便可以使你隨處都瞧得到了。在這嚴重的情勢之下，難道還不採用國貨麽？</p>
<p>女子的衣料，自然以綢緞爲最適宜，但是　　（二二秋式衣料圖案之三）</p>
<p>（二二秋式衣料圖案之四）</p>
<p>女子们常常有一個問題，最難解决，就是：她们一方面情願採用國產綢緞，一方面又須顧慮到花樣的入時。雖然現在有美亞織綢廠常有各種新出品，是適合一般女子所需要，但是我们還感覺到其他綢廠尙未能及到美亞廠同樣的大量生產，並且還感覺到女子们還不曾完全採用國產綢緞，這是一件遺憾。</p>
<p>假使全國女子製綢衣的时候，都能採用國產綢緞，那麽中國的蠶桑事業，便會復興，全國幾千萬靠蠶桑爲生的農民，也可以得到生活的解决了。換句話說，中國女子如穿用國產綢衣，幾千萬的農民便可以活命。</p>
<h3>現代女裝之配色法（續）</h3>
<p>儀翔</p>
<p>▲棕色　屬紅</p>
<p>棕色比醬色略黑，而少黄。其狀爲深蒼，一似人類中之老成人，故其配色以淡艶爲合宜，取其老幼相佐也。</p>
<p>（附合色）橘紅　橙黄　薑黄</p>
<p>▲黄色　主色</p>
<p>黄爲色中鮮艶品，亦占色中之正位，鮮明而雅，光彩而潔。用以製衣，一種雍容之氣概，殊非他色所能及，故高尙女子均喜着之。配色宜合於黄者爲宜，如深黄類是。如配他色稍不合宜，卽足以失美觀。茲將宜配之色錄之。（附合色）銀　黑　白　（未完）</p>

<h3>九一八臨時商塲　强華</h3>
<p>去年（九一八），美亞織綢廠，章華呢絨公司等九個國貨工廠，爲紀念（九一八）起見，曾在南京路設了一個臨時商場，把所有的出品，完全廉價出售，閧動一時。</p>
<p>今年（九一八）又到了！美亞織綢廠與章華呢絨公司，又聯合鴻新染織廠等，一共九個國貨工廠，自今天起，在靜安寺路聖喬奇跳舞塲内，開設九廠臨時國貨商場，把各種國貨出品廉價發售，美亞的二二秋式糺縵縐，前在先施公司開時裝表演會的時候，曾廉售了八天，但是因爲擁擠的闗係，向隅者仍多，所以美亞廠除將其他各種新奇綢緞在九一八臨時商塲出售外，二二秋式糺縵縐，據聞仍照先施公司售價，單幅每尺四角起，雙幅每尺八角起，廉價出售。章華公司，本有一種（九一八）嗶嘰，質地比舶來品好，也在那臨時商塲廉售，以資警惕各界，紀念（九一八）。還有鴻新染織廠所織的布疋，花樣也十分好，染色也很鮮豔，比舶來品亦有過之無不及。聖喬其跳舞塲在靜安寺旁邊，交通極便，凡住在滬西或曹家渡一方面的人，出來更便。今天開幕，每日全天營業呢。</p>

<h3>褲子上的垂直線　趙君豪</h3>
<p>我穿西裝，不知不覺的已經十二年了。自己眞很慚愧！除了夏天幾件紡綢長衫外，差不多所有中國衣服，已完全淘汰淨盡。前年九一八後，我下了最大的决心，要改穿中國裝，但是事實上一時添不了許多，而以前所做的西裝，又不能（付之一炬）。我也知道國產呢絨，市上早有出售，不過據穿過的友人說；（國產呢絨最大的缺點，是没有軔性。穿西裝的人都知道兩個要素，第一是式樣做得要好，第二是要燙得服貼；尤其是褲子上兩根垂直線。國產呢絨没有軔性，無論式樣如何好，穿在身上總不服貼；褲子上兩根垂直線，根本上譚不到，但是却有兩根曲線。）</p>
<p>這種觀念，在我的腦經中徘徊着，我一時眞没有方法，找出一條解决衣服問題的塗徑；只好終日穿舊洋裝，準備做揩油膩的羅宋人了。後來，老友孫君道勝，送我一張章華優待劵，再三勸我打破觀念，並且以人格担保，如果章華呢不好，情願歸他私人（還洋）。我當然不肯長此揩油膩，朋友旣然如此熱心，只好學學胡適之，實行所謂（自古成功在嘗試）了。</p>
<p>踏進了大陸商塲樓下章華門市部，我歡喜的心情，打破了我慚愧的情緒。架上，檯上，不是完全陳列着國產呢麽？顔色，身骨，軔性，何曾比外國貨差一點？法蘭絨，嗶嘰，花呢，Ｓportex應有儘有。我取出道勝送我的優待劵，以極廉的價格，買了兩身國產的呢絨料，興怱怱的走到白克路慶昌泰，託老闖紅鼻頭妥慎裁剪，務必辦到（一切滿意）四字。一星期後，新西裝上我的身了！老友孫恩霖君看見我穿着黑底白線的新裝，先大喊（ttiung不錯，後來又稱讚衣料的大方，一定說是英國貨；要不是英國貨，那裹有這樣紳士的豐度。我大笑了半天，說出了章華國產呢，他還不相信，終於陪他再去考察了半天，方纔很滿意的走出來。</p>
<p>我現在巳經有五套章華呢的衣服了，褲子上始終維持着兩根垂直線，從來没有曲線的發現。</p>

<h3>毋忘（九一八）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>我们中國人現在好像成了一種習慣，無論逢到什麽紀念日，照便是開會，靜默，演說，奏樂，散會，國慶然，國恥亦然。散會以後，大家雨過天青，處之泰然。這種表示，彷彿子孫们每逢祖先的忌辰，謹備清的　　，能靈致祭，或者掩面啼泣，表示追思之意，時日一過，便淡然忘之，以彼例此，簡直無甚區别。可憐同胞们，在一年三百六十五日之中，没有一天值得慶祝，而沉痛的紀念日，反而有加無巳。</p>
<p>九一八是空前的失地紀念，是敵人截斷我们（生命線）的紀念；國人因爲創鉅痛深，也曾一度奮鬥，誓死收復失地；政府也曾宣示（長期抵抗一，規復版圖；及今不過二週年，已是烟消雲散，情勢全非了。在民則民氣消沉，在政則政局混沌，　顧宇内，不忍卒言！照此下去，十年以後，不知成何景象？哀我東北，又是誰家之天下？</p>
<p>縱觀國際風雲，顯然是一天天的嚴重，二次大戰，就怕難免，據預言家的推測，一九三六年必將爆發，我親愛的同胞们丨這並不是神　過敏之談，但看各國整軍經武，可爲明證。報上時常戴着某國修築邊防，某國　造軍艦；某國防空演習……，總之，他们一切海陸空軍的戰備，幾乎晝夜不絶的趕造，我们稍具國家觀念的人，也着實看得眼紅起來。</p>
<p>返觀我國，在這國難嚴重的時期，連年遭受敵人鐵蹄的摧殘，深感宰割的創痛，宜如何舉國一致，湔雪奇恥？然而，竟出人意料，一切的一切，都不能副國人的期望，一旦大戰突發，轉入漩渦，試問將何以應付？我人在這（九一八）二週年紀念日，只是期待着執政諸公，大發慈悲，爲國爲民，謀一線之生機丨</p>
<h3>河山無恙耶</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>瞧着中國各書店出版的地圖，還是同從前一樣，把東北四省，都列入（版圖），於是乎我疑心着我是在做夢，難道我们在（不抵抗），等政策之下，果然收復了失地了麽？但是偶然見到一本（大日本帝國全國），不禁使我嚇一大跳，又似乎在做夢，同時又疑心我是眼花，活見鬼。這些且不去思慮，可是（九一八）已又到臨了。失地辱國不喪師的（九一八），巳又無情地到臨了，我於是乎證明了我不是在做夢，東四省已由半殖民地，而在事實上已成爲大日本帝國的正式殖民地了。</p>
<p>在長白山頭，在松花江上，都缷下了青天白日旗，換上了麽幡，自然是不用說得。在鐵蹄之下的東北民衆，每天含着眼涙裝笑臉，挨着鞭子說受用，自然是勢所必然的。而更其是今天，這個（九一八紀念日），不用說得，嶄新的魔幡，是插遍了東四省，而且是勢所必然的，每一個東北人民，將被逼着用眼涙濕潤着喉嚨，而狂喊三聲（大滿洲共和國萬歳，大日本帝國萬歳）。我们更可以想像到今天日本朝野歡欣鼓舞的情形，如何地慶祝着這一個開拓殖民地的紀念日。</p>
<p>一切不堪聞問的事情，無情地一幕一幕，有聲有色地映着演着，眞使人有些捉摸不定究竟是在做夢呢還是醒着。因爲萬無此理的（九一八），巳是二週紀念了。旣是有了（九一八），而睜眼瞧着一切昇平氣象，似乎東北那一幕，全是夢景。可是喪鐘響了，各地都在舉行（九一八）紀念，那麽（九一八）是千眞萬確的事實無疑了。但是誰又在計畫着收復失地呢？這分明還是在做夢。</p>
<p>這眞是一個無法打破的啞謎。山海闗外的青山綠水，或許依舊蹲着流着。大家趕快把腦袋安放在枕頭上罷，或許在睡夢中會有人帶給你一個好消息丨（河山無恙）？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十五回　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>桂枝道：您手上提了一大包東西、由那兒來，請到我家去坐坐罷，劉家媽將手上提的一串大小紙包舉高着看了一看，自己先笑了，就像這裹面有無數的話，非說不可一般。於是向江氏點了幾點頭道：好的，我就是這樣，喜歡找兩個說得來的人，聊聊天兒，他說着，竟不待江氏在前面引路，已經走向大門裹邊來了。江氏將他引到屋子裹坑上坐下了，張羅着一陣茶烟，就問道：劉家媽，你這樣大一包的小一包的提着，是在城裹回來嗎？劉家媽又看了放在坑上的那些東西，就笑起來了。他道：不，剛才我由甘家門口過身，那甘太太看見，一定把我呌了進去……他只說到這裹，江氏看看桂枝的臉，已經有些紅潮上臉了。這時就不由得心裹忐忑一陣，無論如何，心裹頭要說的話，却是不能跟着向下去說的了。就攔住道：你别提他了。那個人家是個勢利眼。江氏雖只說了這樣一句，可是這下面，自然有許多難言之隠。劉家媽那裹會知道這一肚子難念的經，在他一番得意之下，依然繼續的道：那甘太太爲人也挺好的。他家有許多粗活，（註：指縫衣製履而言總是找我做。給錢還是不少。他家昨天請了客剩下許糕點和瓜子花生，他說了，若把這些東西都留着，恐怕會壞了，所以分給我吃一點。我倒不要吃，這些好糕點，孩子们那裹吃過，所以我毫不客氣，就大一包小包的，提了這些回來。桂枝對於甘家現在是懷恨透了，不但是不願人家說甘家的好話，就是有人說到甘家的甘字，也有些不願聽。（一九○）</p>
<h3>（九一八）算了嗎？</h3>
<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>没有瞧看我國的疆域地圖，我们健忘的中國人，是忘記（九一八）的國恥了丨雖然也許有幾位朋友記得，不去看看疆域地圖，也難以觸目傷心。秋海棠葉子般的我國疆域，（九一八）以後，不是在葉片的東北部分，大大的缺了一角嗎？這一部分，顔色嬌綠，葉肉肥厚，眼巴巴被　宼鯨呑了去；還是視耽耽，欲逐逐，想蠶食到别的部分來，（九一八）的國防，不是痛心疾首嗎丨</p>
<p>我们貴國的國恥紀念雖多，（九一八）當然輪着坐第一把交椅。不，也許不久的將來，還有甚麽出色的國恥，（九一八）要退坐第二把交椅啊丨（九一八）的紀念，方法很多：跳跳舞，看看電影，逛逛遊戲塲，這因爲娱樂可以救國袖上纒一條黑布，嘴裹嘆幾口寃氣，開開會，發發傳單，這也是國防紀念的例行公事。</p>
<p>（九一八）（二二八）過了兩年了，國難年頭，早巳過去，酣歌妙舞，夢死醉生，我國貴國人天生成一副好八字，當然可以安安穏穏享太平之福，甚麽（九一八）（一二八）早丢東洋大海去了。豈知東洋國的人民君臣，却抱了杞人憂天的心思，說：再過了三年，到了西歷一九三六年，或一九三七年，便是他们昭和十一二年的時候，世界大戰一定要來了。他们的假想敵有三國，丨美國·蘇俄·中國。他们認這個年頭，呌做（國難年）。我想：日本人很像我國秦末時候的項羽，没有吃過一回敗仗，何等威風。可是這位項羽，還没有走到垓下，巳經曉得那時走到垓下的危險，難道日本人神經過敏嗎？中國人神經麻木嗎？也許日本人相信（人事），中國人相信（天命，中國人量大福大，自有老天保護，甚麽世界大戰，自可高枕無憂，日本人眞是庸人自擾</p>
<p>日本人怎樣庸人自擾？我曉得他們出版界，關於未來世界大戰的著作，很多很多，甚麽（空軍的爆炸），（大戰的預測）····等小册子，出版比我們（戀愛小說）的多··我們的大著作家，那裏有閒工夫造這些作品。日本現在的軍械製造廠，日夜趕造軍器，似非在大戰前完成不可。他說：（他们預備開戰後，至少可支持三年：經濟能力，也可以支持六七年。）我们咀咒他们不久便要崩潰，眞是痴人說夢。</p>
<p>今天是（九一八），大家應感傷，但從目下現狀而論，一些没有豫備，到了（一九三六年）世界大戰起來，只有束手待斃。唉！我们的國難，（九一八）便算了嗎？</p>

<p>爲了這個緣故，兒童在午后四五時吃過點心後，不應再給他们吃多量的食物，睡眠的時間在六時半和七時。一個標準的健康的兒童，不需要吃夜飯的；許多做母親的以爲牛乳和餅乾，或者一薄片的糕餅，麵包，奶油和糖醬等，對於漫漫長夜睡着不飲不食的兒童，多少有些利益，多少有些帮助的。其實這種見解是錯誤的。食物過多，反足以損害消化而得一種消化不良症，吃過下午的點心再吃夜飯，對於兒童未免過多，决不能消化這許多東西。當然胃的反叛和夜間驚嚇是一種平常結果了。</p>
<p>還有一種夜間驚嚇的普通原因是　腫，一個孩子因　腫而患夜間驚嚇的原因是空氣通道被阻以致他不能得到營養神經或神經系所需的量養氣。於是神經中心受了飢荒和毒素，一種剌激的情形便產生了。</p>
<p>有時候夜間驚嚇是疾病的徵兆，卽如麻疹猩紅熱，甚至風濕病等類。爲了這個緣故，雖則患夜間驚嚇的兒童，應該敎他安靜和平，但是相當限度的重大處理，却也不可少。</p>
<p>一個神經衰弱的兒童患夜間驚嚇的時候，天天給他一頓魚肝油與麥芽，有驚人的功效，足以帮助神經組織和神經中心增强有規律的食時食量，有規律的睡眠時間，多吸新鮮空氣，减少過度興奮剌激，都是一個神經衰弱而患夜間驚嚇的兒童的養育要素，而食品中應該包含多量牛乳，鷄蛋和魚</p>
<h3>日漸長育的嬰兒</h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>有一天，一位年輕的母親到我這裹來，顯出一種很苦痛的樣子，因爲伊的一位一歳大的健全嬰兒，還没有獨坐的傾向，鄰居的一個少一個月的嬰兒，倒能夠很自然的獨坐了。</p>
<p>有許多嬰兒很早便能獨坐，有的很遲，那是没有一定的。有許多嬰兒比别個長育得快，他的腦部也長成得快，因此他们知道要做什麽而又做成了。别個嬰兒或者在背部筋肉略有缺點或軟弱，這種毛病祗有用忍耐工夫來矯正的；這樣的嬰兒應該多居空氣和日光中。用鹽與水來洗背和腿，可以使它强健有力，每天早晨加以一次按摩，也可以幫助免除這種軟弱。</p>
<p>有許多嬰兒長育得非常之快，或竟太快了，（自然）不能把所需要的供給他的每一部分，因此有些地方未免要見軟弱。有軟弱部分的嬰兒，或者是缺少了運動所致，也未可知。運動在長育上是十分需要的。假使筋骨不運用，它们便要逐漸衰弱而完全失去機能。運動不但使筋骨活運動用，並且可使呼吸流暢，這樣便可多吸養氣進去。</p>
<p>兒童的能坐或能行，在一年的什麽時候，很有闗係，他们的能力很有大小的差異。例如一個兒童在夏季中能坐或能行，那麽難免是一種小小落後，因爲只怕是，越出他的體力了。在春季與夏季長育比在冬季格外來得快。</p>
<p>或者食品需要豐潤的。有要多嬰兒吃了平常的食品，長得很胖；有的吃了特殊的食品，而未見易於發育。把少許的乳酪或調製的麥芽，加入食料中，倒可得到一種奇妙的功效。衡量體重對於落後的嬰兒也是重要的，從這個方法止，可以决定到底嬰兒的實際長育上有了什麽毛病没有。</p>

<h3>中西醫問題之商榷</h3>
<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>自立法院委員焦易堂先生倡言國醫後，於是世之所謂中西醫問題，乃囂囂及於貴人之口焉，吾心儀焦先生以爽直磊落之態度，足使口是心非之徒，不能騎牆而立，袖手而觀，是亦足以豪矣，夫中央委員中，欲言焦先生之言者，奚啻少數人乎，其懾於科學之權威，而訥訥不能出諸口者，一部也；其籌於利害之闗係，而泄泄不煩諸心者，又一部也。是以中西醫問題之醖釀雖久，而荏苒五載，卒之　發一朝，吾怪夫不爆發於改醫師條例爲西醫條例之曰，吾又怪夫發難之人，不在衛生署署長宣布其堂堂政策之口，而被國醫館館長得其先機，使其振振有詞曰：（立法院通過西醫條例時，衛生當局，聲明不久更提國醫條例，乃該項條例，迄今未見擬訂），是此問題之爆發，其正面足以稱焦先生之勇而有爲，其反面適足以證衛生當局之儒而無能者也，吾爲此懼，爰草斯篇，以供芻蕘焉。</p>
<p>今之報章，爲此問題而熱開者，先有汪精衛先生之主張，繼而有陳果夫先生之言論，繼而有焦先生之告國人書，終且有諸先生對於焦先生言論之批評，茲數者，大致各有其是，亦各有其非，若一一指摘而是非之，則背乎此文之本意，概從略焉。蓋吾以爲問題之原動，要在國醫條例，而所以左右國醫條例之癓結，要在通盤籌算之中西醫問題而巳。</p>
<p>吾縱觀二十九中央委員所提之國醫條例二十六條，及焦先生告國人書之四千言，可一語以蔽之曰，國醫宜與西醫對立並存而已矣，吾又綜察各方反焦之言論，亦可二語以蔽之曰，舊醫非科學，已不合於世界潮流，不得與新醫對立，而國醫館非行政機闗，不得纂奪政權而已矣，然吾以爲欲解答我國之醫問題，固不若是之單簡也，務宜平其意氣，去其主奴，廣其思益，綜政情民情財情而兼顧之，亘學術立法行政而澈論之，無利害之心，假借之慾，妒嫉之念，以　雜混淆其間，夫然後論得其平，事克有臧矣請試論之。</p>
<p>世之論中西醫問題，或新舊醫問題者，莫不先有非科學與科學化之辯，是故商榷中西醫問題，自學術始歟？夫舊醫學之違反科學，論之者有余氏靈素商兌，爲急先鋒，其他短文雜錄，不遑枚舉，即中央國醫館組織章程第一條，有（採用科學方式，整理中國醫藥）之句，亦自認陰陽五行六氣爲非科學矣，而彼舊醫者，多爲之曲辯邪護，蓋欲炫文以售其技，井蛙夏虫，吾固不欲深責之，所惜者焦先生因欲捧對立並存之的，更不憚拉雜論証，爲之淨誇，甚且以曲解之實騐主義四字，强附其身，謂其並不重視理論，是將宋元明清醫家爭温補清凉之諸醫籍，一概抹殺，噫詖而離矣，是故謂爲舊醫近乎科學，得與新醫對立並存云云，此非論之拙，亦事之誣者也。</p>
<p>雖然，醫學之不能對立爲一事，醫師之可否並存，又爲一事，以舊醫學劣敗爲理由，謂爲即足以淘汰舊醫者，此局視於學術，而不顧其他一切政情財情之盲目者也，夫以麻黄治喘，當歸調經，雖無詳細之統計，爲之證明其騐與不騐，合與不合，然而顛沛流離窮苦無告之大多數民衆，苟能得此模稜未證明之治療劑，以慰其呻吟床第者足矣。昔者莊生有言曰，宋人資章甫而適諸越，越人斷髮文身，無所用之，以今日經濟之枯竭，官吏之不肖，已將全國小民，斷髮文身而越人之矣，雖世有章甫，而不能使之用也。被立法院委員，而爲民衆代喉舌也者，專以現實之政情民情財情立論，責政府以處理中西醫問題之模稜，爲民衆主張暫時延用舊醫，夫誰得而誹議之，此執民情以破學術之爭者，爲一道也。（未完）</p>
<h3>焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商榷（續）</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>焦先生說：（至於藥物的豐富，本草上面可以看得出來，所謂神農本經，在國醫之實騐主義中間，表現最顯著的色彩，一種一種都經過人们嘗試，才把他記載起來，西醫認作是草根樹皮，不值一顧，豈知治病的有效成分，正在草根樹皮中間，）我讀了這一段高論，眞要發笑，本草是各處各種單方的彚編，單方是土人傳出來的，都是人類本能所發見的事項，和陶隠居所說（藕皮散血，起自庖人，牽牛　水，近出野老，）的事項一樣，國醫们利用本草，不過是利用人類本能所發見之事項，野蠻人也會做去，值得什麽大驚小怪。照焦先生所說，像煞貴國醫先建設了實騐主義，然後把草根樹皮一件件嘗試起來，方才成就本草一部書，簡單的說一句，像煞本草這部書，自從國醫實騐主義產生出來的，眞是說得巧妙，可只惜鄰是狙公朝四暮三的權詐，從事理上探討起來，恐怕是站不住脚跟的罷？</p>
<p>還有（豈知治病的有效成分，正在草根樹皮中間，）的（豈知）二字，不知說給誰聽？我曉得貴國醫用草根樹皮，向來不說成分，只說點色相臭味，發苗抽莖開花結子的時節，來分升降浮沉，寒熱温凉，再玄一點，還說屬金屬木，入　人肝，國醫典籍俱在，要想欺瞞那個？雞那皮中有金雞納箱，麻黄裹面有　非特　，藥用植物中間有種種植物　，究竟是國醫（豈知，）還是西醫（豈知）呢？似乎越弄越糊塗了？再說草根樹皮。西醫也從未認作不值不顧。請焦先生到外國醫學校去看看。草根樹皮。恐怕要昨舌。就是中國有幾處大學。也羅致得不少。貴國醫授徒。才眞不看藥物。西醫的顯微鏡下各物。國醫才從未一顧呢。</p>
<p>焦先生說西醫藥物貧乏，國醫藥物　當，我初以爲不知怎樣豐富法，原來是本草，查神農本草，不過三百六十種，加入名醫别錄，也不過七百二十種，加入大觀本草，也不過一千五百餘種，加入本草綱目，也不過一千八百餘種，加入趙氏拾遺，也不過二千種左右，現在科學醫的新藥，起碼也不下二千種，更加之以科學醫所謂舊藥，總在三千種以上，誰富誰貧，可以一覽而知，再請焦先生比比中國論藥的書有幾部，外國論藥的書有幾部，况且本草裘面像天　蓋，人肉，陰毛，敗扇，秃筆之類，滑稽得可笑。也算是藥，焦先生未免有點誇大得太不像話了。</p>
<p>焦先生說：（再看總理心理建設中說：從前西洋人看中國人喫的物的血和肝腸藏器，認爲是非常野　，他们爲保持固有文明起見，對於這一類東西是不屑喫的，往後不知怎樣一來，發明動物的血和肝　　畢有補益人们之血和肝腸　　的功效，過有人　血和肝腸　　　　，拿動物的血和肝　　　治療，特别設立　　名　，呌作　器　法。他们學我们　器療法是這樣，他们學我们之草根樹皮療法亦是這樣，他们會仿效中國醫　，用麻黄去治喘，用大黄去通便，用當歸去調經，用苗陳去療黄　，西洋人從中國樂物中引用一種去，國内西醫又從西洋人藥物中引用一種來，國内西醫不恤兜狠大的　子，跟著西洋人亦步亦趨，民族心理消失淨盡，說起來　　痛心。）這是焦先生的總理學說講義，也是立法院法制委員長的訓話。但是總理是用飲食來證明知難行易，並且鄭重地向國人說：（我中國近代文明進化，事事皆落人之後，惟飲食一道之進步，至今尙爲文明各國所不及。）這段文字，焦先生記得没有？可見得豆腐呀，動物血呀，都是飲食一道的東西，也只有這方面的東西還算是不落人後。換一句說：不落人後的東西，只有限於飲食一道。焦先生違背了（只有）兩個字，拿來推廣到醫藥上去，就不是總理說這話的宗旨了。焦先生要替總理學說做講義，來訓話國人，最好把總理學說言論，全部融會貫通一下再說！千萬不可以斷章取義，簸弄總理的學說來惑亂國人！　　至於兜大圈子，跟着西洋人亦步亦趨的話，這是没有法子的事情，他们是用科學方法進取的，我们是用非科學方法保守的，他们是向着一個目標前進的，我们是向着兩個方向徘徊的·歧行不至·疑事無功，自然是事事皆落人之後。火藥礮彈是我们中國發明的，但是現在軍事武器，我们事事落後，不怕你不兜大圈子亦步亦趨。指南針是中國發明的，但是由南針而磁，由磁而電，他们事事爭先，不由你不兜大圈子亦步亦趨。醫藥方面也是如此，國中未始没有研究的人才，發明的腦力，不幸而在這種環培之下，英雄没有用武之地，巧婦難做無米之炊，政府不提倡，社會不認識，要想横財從天上落下來，是没有這樣便宜的買賣的吓。焦先生不要弄錯！要想不跟着人跑，是要迎頭趕上去的！總理的意思，是要我们學他的最新，譬如他们從前用煤力，現在用電力，我们要學他，應該逕　學他用電力，丨請着總理民族主義第六講。丨並没有敎國人用鑽木取火的舊法，和電氣來絜長較短，並没有敎國人用每一個人單獨用鍋爐去煮飯喫的法兒，來抗拒電氣。醫學也是這樣，是要用他们最新的種論，最新的工具，最新的方法去研究，方才可以和他们並駕齋驅，或者說不定可以後來居上。若是用用草根樹皮，守着一千年傳統的習慣，這是總理所說睡覺，不去奮鬥，）的行爲，連（向後跟着他）一句話還夠不上，那裹談得到（迎頭趕上去）呢？</p>
<p>總理建設民族心理，是說我们中國人去學外國的科學，並非雖事，不是禁止中國人去學外國科學，笑駡中國人去學外國科學，慟心中國人去學外國科學。飛上天的飛機，中國人都可學得到，其餘還有甚麽難事學不到呢？）這句話是鼓勵我们去學他们科學，並不曾說我们事事落後的舊東西，比較外國還要好。就醫學說起來：就是要鼓勵我们去學科學醫，用他们最新發明的學理，器械，方法，去研究科學醫，一定可以和他们並駕齊騙，並不是說用用草根樹皮，比較他们還要好。總理是進取的，是革命的，焦先生不要曲解總理的話，來做守舊的，開倒車的護符。總理拚命誘導我们，鼓勵我们去學科學，以鞏固其民族主義的實現，如今我们把自然科學中的醫學，遵着總理敎訓，迎頭趕去，却被焦先生說喪盡民族心理。唉！我们被誣陷是不足惜，恐怕總理九原有知，是要椎胸痛哭的呀，不單單慟心就完了！</p>
<p>焦先生說：（假如在業務方面稍稍看輕一點，能夠真截從學術上互相研究，吾料三十年以後，未必不能自成爲中華民族之新的醫學，領導世界醫學走上一條新的徑路。）焦先生聲聲口口把醫的學術革命，認做業務之爭，是横着心故意誣陷我们的話，我畢已聲明過，請他拿出證據來，那一件不是學理上的討論？講到業務：那閉着口一句不說的西醫，或者向來守緘默的國醫，都有飯可喫，不限定要搶奪别人的飯碗，才有碗喫。進一步說：眞要想飯碗滿，生意好，門庭如市的西醫或國醫，只要用了模稜兩可的策略，講點不三不四，非　非馬的議論，剛剛可以適合現在社會的心理。這是興盛業務的頂好手段，何必多說多話，生出兩方面惡感呢？？就是鄙人：要想業務發　，也决不應該出此下策。所以我的攻擊國醫，完全是從學理上探討，說不定還要犧牲業務。我的態度，已經在拙著（醫學革命論初集）自序當中表明過了，今且節錄一叚，寫在下面。</p>
<p>（一、不是和舊醫奪飯碗，是批評舊醫，喚醒舊醫，要想蔡理舊醫，改造舊醫，陶</p>

<p>請焦先生和國人平心靜氣想一想丨我们攻擊　　，實在是把學理方面看得太重。黨務方面看得太輕了。</p>
<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>第六章　醫藥敎育與刋物　　第二節　舊醫藥敎育</p>
<p>中外古時，醫藥二學皆併爲一談，但是我國至今猶然古時没有一定的敎育機闗，大概私家授徒，臨症講解，就算不二法門。幸而那時人心誠樸，敎授子弟，必然諄諄道地，而著書立說，也代有傳人，漢晋兩朝，著者就不少，歷代又復增輯，只可惜研究的方法，違背了（實騐統計）的原則。於是學說就無法整理，以致著書者自以爲是，讀書者，在一句成語，呌作（盡信書不如無書）之下彷徨着。這是中國醫藥無價值的大原因。也就是現在新舊學說衝突的總機括。唐朝曾在太醫署敎授諸生，並分體療，瘡腫，少小，耳目，口齒和角法五科，宋朝太醫局九科學生，多至三百人，並且每年要考試什麽墨義，脈，義，論方，等六門，元朝立醫學十三科，每三年一試，要考較醫經，辨騐藥味，合試經書等類。明代和元朝一樣，而考法更嚴，由禮部會考，分别等第，清朝設立敎習廳，敎太監醫學的呌内敎習，敎授醫官子弟的呌外敎習，考試醫士醫生由太醫院堂官，就素間難，經本草，脈訣内出題。（上文參考李著各國醫學敎育一書）。上看上面所述歷朝的狀况，可知中國從没有注意到爲民衆用的醫藥敎育，考醫，敎醫，一古腦兒都在輩毂之下，無非含有貴族封建性質，但是閱者要知以前的歷史如此，然後再看近來舊醫敎育是怎樣，兩兩比較，恐怕就是迷信舊醫的人们，對於舊醫的將來，也要失望吧。</p>
<p>到了清朝末年，連敎習廳早巳不聽見，於是全國舊醫藥從貴族到平民，可謂一律在私人授徒制之下，十年前舊醫受了新潮流的剌激，方在各地辦了幾處中醫學校，上海得風氣之先，自然是首創，中醫學校的課程中間，夾着些科學的生理解剖等門，因而得了新醫的皮毛。此中就產生兩種人物，科學觀念較多的，就覺得自己所持學說，太無根據，因此而放棄了舊醫，崇拜新醫。可惜根本學術被時間蹉跎了，（這事有某中醫致社會醫報余雲岫書可證），没有科學觀念的學生，自然全被玄說所迷惑。然而都拿最淺的西醫學說的皮毛，來攻擊西醫，市上現在，類此胡纒的文字甚多，焦易堂告國人書中，說什麽（少年國醫，未嘗不取新醫之長），大約就指此輩。我在上海這許多年，居然認識了一個讀數百卷中醫書而駁舊醫的余雲岫，却還没有看見過一個讀數十册新醫書，而駁新醫的舊醫，足見中醫書愈多讀愈見其不近事實，西醫書愈多讀愈無可非了。至於社會上對於中醫學校的學生，困爲他不是傳統式的某某夫子門人。未免有些習慣上的不信仰，中醫學校學生，也覺得新中醫，不爲最舊的人们所喜，不爲最老資格的舊醫所推許，更覺得中醫學校所習的伎倆，也决没有授徒方法所得的來的神秘。而且敎育部，又不許中醫學校列入學校系統。辦中醫學校的，也感到招中學生習玄學，有倒戈的危險，有此種種原因，遂使中醫學校，曾由一的時左髦，而變爲沉寂，舊醫的敎育，依舊歸到授徒的老路。我们如今先提出授徒制下所謂徒的人物，在現在這潮流之下，雖說敎育不普及，然而闗門在家專讀四書五經的儒生，大概漸漸找不到了。初中畢業生，國文剛剛清通，倒又要跑上高中去了，即使不上高中讀書，而學中醫，却已經受了自然科學的訓練，有些格格不入。於是喇下肯學舊醫的學徒，可想而知，是學書不成學劍不成的人物其次我们再論授徒制的時間丨即使有舊家庭中的儒生，或是初中畢業生爲求衣麥捷徑，去學舊醫，老實說，國文程度，不夠看古書，而且拜先生必拜名醫，以求捷徑中之捷徑，試問那些半工半習的學徒，要這位狠忙的名師，從補習中文敎起，連帶靈樞素間難經傷寒論脈訣本草臨症講述，一手包辦，限期賣錢，試問事實上可能不可能？而况先生自己國文怎樣程度，也還是重大問題呢。再次我们論授徒制的方法，丨挽近授徒制，因爲上述資格和時間兩個條件不解决，所以就方棄讀書而美其名曰祇靠經騐，從生涯清淡的先生，簡直無可經騐，從紅先生也只有代寫脈案用藥，而從不習仕麽診斷，學生因爲求學方法，一無憑藉，只好留心先生那些表面和病人的應對，並在先生脈案末了如何，缷責的字樣上用功夫，但是這種地方是須心領袖會的，故而師生同診一病，只好各玄其玄，各神其神，各秘其秘，學說還有什麽根源可尋呢？</p>
<h3>性狀</h3>
<p>本品之未除去果皮者，係一種淡黄色之蒴果，微呈球形，上下稍扁平，表面滑澤，有三條縱直之鈍稜，及三條明顯之縱溝，内部分三室，每室，每室中含有種子約十至十三個，其種子形狀極不規則，外面現棕色，有細密之網絞，有微臭，味辛灼帶松節油性，而頗佳適。</p>
<h3>成分</h3>
<p>本品含脂肪及揮發油甚富，約達一○％</p>
<h3>效用</h3>
<p>本品用作健胃解毒藥，及芳香劑。</p>
<p>（附錄舊說）　辛熱，香散，健脾，煖胃，破氣，燥濕，却寒，除痰，化食，法瘴癘，寒瘧，客寒，胃痛，霍亂，瀉痢，噎膈，反胃，痞滿，吐酸，痰飲，積聚，腦寒，齒痛，酒毒，魚肉毒，過劑助脾熱，耗氣，損目，老弱慎用。，　本草綱目曰，草豆蔲草果雖是一物，然微有不同，今建寧所產豆宼，大如龍眠，而形微長，其皮黄白薄而峭，其仁如縮砂仁，而辛香氣和，滇廣所產草果，長大如訶子，其皮色黑厚而稜密，其子粗而辛臭，正如班蝥之氣。</p>
<p>又說本草以草豆蔲草果爲一物，而時珍辨所產與實之形狀别之，本草全蒙則謂爲二物，然論花葉之形狀，祇云是草豆宼，不及草果，豈本屬一物，其子實因土地而不同乎，子實旣異，故氣味亦有和烈之殊，主治不同，未可混用耳，夫草果有外皮，草豆蔲露仁，如無外皮。</p>
<h3>政府應速制止國醫館非法行動</h3>
<p>— 巽初</p>
<p>一般舊　，自國醫館成立後，頗欲傚軍閥剷據，跋扈稱雄，本刋嘗爲文嚴斥其謬妄矣，顧尙鮮有舉揭其事實，以白社會，此不侫草此篇之微旨也。　查中央國醫館組織章程第一條，明明規定（以採用科學）式·整理中國醫學，改善療病及製藥方法爲宗旨）。乃該館妄自尊大，擅稱舊醫藥行政機闗，發表命令，儼然官署，割裂行政系統，刦奪政府職權，紊亂衛生行政，阻碍醫藥進化，如該館廣東新會縣支館，去年十二月間，竟因强迫醫生藥店登記，引起極大風潮。（見該支館第二期公報）又上海市分館，復於本年四月間，因徵收方箋費，與本市舊醫界互閧，一時以攻擊該館决非醫藥行政機闗爲焦點。（見上海三舊醫會方箋案特刋）又浙江省分館，近史朦請該省民政廳，令飭各縣政府，將管理舊醫藥行政事宜，一律畀以全權，（見八月十七日浙江新聞）其第二步並即頒發國醫證書，藥店執照，訂定專章，收取證照各費，駸駸乎大有與政府機闗平分秋色之概。按行政院會議，審議國醫條例，早據敎育内政兩部呈覆，認爲國醫館係學術團體，並非行政機闗，函請中政會查照各在案。（疊據報載）是該館之一切舉措行動，實巳超越其地位與職權，顯爲非法，且該館成立三載，虚耗國帑逾十餘萬，（每月以五千元計）成績毫無，糾紛迭起，縱政府即不立予撤銷，亦應令飭嚴加制止，幸勿姑息放任，重貽醫藥行政之羞也，願當軸注意及之，</p>

<h3>退一步哲學</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>我们中國人的耐性是眞好的，受人打了一拳耐下去，給人踢了一脚，也耐下去，逆來順受，什麽都可以忍耐過去，這確是我们的精神文明勝人之處，而我國文化之所以連綿四千年到今不絶，也大半是這耐性之功。什麽事都可以今天推明天，明天還有明天，這樣的辦法，延宕了四千年，也忍耐了四千年，而一直還可以延宕忍耐下去，也當絶無問題。</p>
<p>况且到了耐性不能繼續時，我们還有退一步的辦法。這退一步的哲學，實在比忍耐更加來得高明而且合理。忍耐大約是合於知足常樂的格言。站在不進不退的地位，而退一步却分明有一定的舉動了，這所以是高明，而且合於大事化小，小事化無，乃至多一事不如少一事等等格言的。耐性究竟還要一點保守維持之力，而退一步却很省力，這就是合理，因爲向抵抗最少的方向進行，是宇宙間的絶對眞理。</p>
<p>退一步哲學的意義，没有比在進一步想寸步難行，退一步想海闊天空二句話中，表現得最明白而精彩了，而退一步的好處，也卽在於能夠海闊天空。他人騎大馬，我獨騎驢子，這就是能退一步想的好處。而且退一步人人可以做得到，商店工場中有口飯喫喫的學徒夥計，比失業者没法找得飯喫的勝一籌了，失業的工農大衆還比討飯的化子强，討飯乞丐還可以想比餓死的災民好，餓死的災民還可以想比無故被屈殺枉死的鬼好，所以退一步想是可以說没有底止的，也卽是海闊天空。對於現狀不滿足的人，由退一步想而封閉了進路，因爲退一步是只敎你退走的，開倒車最是特長，而進一步想旣是寸步難行，不打倒車更復何待。於是有爲的青年遭受了進一步的困難，受了此種哲學感化之後，紛紛開倒車，而天下太平了。</p>
<p>退一步哲學所以發達，因爲得着懒惰的神髄，中國人最貪安逸，頂喜高枕而臥，坐享其成，但在坐而享不到時，不免難以安心立命，於是退一步哲學就不可少，有此方能繼續懶惰，以貫徹不勞而獲無爲而治之大道。因之退一步哲學卽是精神上勝利的秘法，由此可知從遼寧退錦州，從錦州退闗内，以及退出熟河，我軍安全退出等等，卽是另一種的抗日勝利。而此種退一步哲學將促進世界大同的實現，也無疑問，因一切闘爭，均可免除於無形，不但國際間的爭執可以消滅，卽階級的對立，也可解除。有識之士，應同來宣揚這一種哲學，使全世界人人服膺，於是天下必可眞正太平，而東方精神文明光被四海。</p>
<h3>愛書狂者之話</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>李日華的（紫桃軒雜綴），（又綴），我所見到的有三種本子，一是明刻本，連（六研齋筆記），（畫媵），（續畫媵）等共十册，中缺（雜綴）一卷，書賈索二百元，當然無力購取。二是巾箱本的（檇李叢書）本。三是影印的蔣心餘批註本，此本缺（又綴）卷三。就中，以蔣本爲最有趣，批註完全如塾師改學生課卷，令人噴飯，又令人想見此老讀書時的有趣的神情，以及他對明代作家的態度。這些批註，有的是很有道理，有的却未免苛求。摘錄若干則於此，使讀者想想這一個天眞的愛書狂者之狂態；</p>
<p>此論可笑　何必瑣瑣　明人讀書，不研究字劃，但囫圇讀之（折）字不通　無此句法　大約唐人類書如（初學記），（藝文類聚）等書，先生似未曾見遇　此條段不可存，辱没煞名士矣　竟不讀書　不唐不宋，無此詩法，知先生於此事，竟是門外漢　足下似未讀（雜騷註）此等不知，抄之何爲　此公詩學極淺，於杜尤格不相入　妄爲之詞　其實足下未曾望其項背　杜撰字可恨　不敢說程朱，未脫明人習氣　此是（考工記）之文，抄之何爲？可見明人不讀書　此又不知從何書抄入，若知是周禮，不抄矣　不倫不類　明人著書，不通如此　此由明代諸人之空疏　其書足下曾見否　先生家中，想不蓄類書　可笑　穿鑿可恨（兵）之與（丘）絶然不同，何來此悠謬之談？此爲明人不通字學之一證，此據（癸辛雜識），宋人巳不通矣</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>不知什麽時候，從謝肇淛的（文海波沙）裹，抄下了一則（藏書），說愛書狂者的愛書，眞是無微不至。此則余文是：</p>
<p>古人珍重書籍，家藏率皆精好。鄴侯牙籖三萬，至新若手未觸。謝嘩書，自校讐，列二十廚。沈鱗手寫細書滿數十筐。陸龜蒙得書即錄，所藏雖少，皆精可傳，非徒誇多已也。然不數　，竟喪於子弟兵燹之手，故杜進書尾跋云：（請俸寫來手自校，子孫讀之知聖敎，鬻及借人爲不孝。）陳亞詩云：（滿室圖書雜典墳，華亭仙客岱云根。當時若不和花賣，便是吾家好子孫）。二君之慮深矣。然不肖子孫，蕩產如風掃籜，即萬語諄諄，安能禁使不鬻哉。但得鬻於賞鑑之家，代我珍藏，尤勝於無賴子架上鼠吃雀污揩儿和泥也。趙文敏書尾，跋云：（聚書觀書，亦匪易事。觀書者凈几焚香，澄心靜慮，勿捲腦，勿折角，勿以夾剌，勿以作枕，勿以爪侵字，勿以睡揭幅，隨摸隨修，隨開隨揜，後之得吾書者，并奉贈此法。）至哉此言，可謂無我之盛心，典籍之鮑叔矣。</p>
<p>此條雖不免有迂闊可笑之處，但古人愛書若狂，對書的顧慮深遠，可謂用盡心機矣。</p>
<h3>神仙·老虎·狗</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>距今七年前，那並不是很古的事，南昌的報紙上討論一個（皮帶與戀愛）的問題；英雄的革命事業，在美人闗上遇到了磨折，（革命尙未成功，同志還須努力。）大家都覺到那時候還不該（兒女情長，英雄氣短）似的。由七年後的我们看來，那雖不是很古的事，但要燃燒天下一應美人的芳心，使她们拜倒於皮帶之前，恍似很古很古的隔世之事了。一二八之役，雖曾一閃地在蘇州一帶表現這麽熱烈的情緒；若以之和國民革命軍在南昌武漢時代，和革命戰士同行便覺光榮的那心理相比，還差着一格。看見了掛皮帶的，在記憶上閃出了另一種觀念，諸如在火車輪船上所見的，在戲院酒樓所見的；嘴裹雖不敢說，心裹總那麽想，所謂（道路以目）；我想，在掛着皮帶的，亦必有恍如隔世）之感。</p>
<p>我現在不想談今世的事，只談談那古代的這一類的事。如唐代藩鎭的割據，每種史書上都有很長的記載，還帶幾句詛咒的按語；其實也有幾分冤枉的。唐朝初年的兵制，沿用後周的府兵制；所謂（府兵），用一句現在革命的話頭來說，就是（武力和民衆聯在一起，武力成爲民衆的武方。）籍民以爲兵，選揀魁健才力的丁壯，令剌史以農隙敎練，合爲百府。平時居於鄉村，有事出去從征；事訖，依舊各還其鄉。當時，這些兵力，並不是屬於某一個人的，每有征伐，隨時由政府命將；戰事旣罷，兵歸其府，將上其印，所以没有擁兵的人。依理論說，這是頗合於理想的。但是唐朝兵制之壞，並不始於天寶以後的藩鎭之亂：唐朝初年，宗師之間，就有所　元從禁軍）。　　　萬人，都是跟高祖起義太原的從龍戰士，統一以後，他们願留宿　，從龍到底，於是處以　北閒田，世守其業。後來所謂左右　武軍，所謂　騎，所謂羽林軍，就從這些禁軍中產生出來。天賣以前，至少政府可以指揮這些禁軍：天寶以後，唐代宗命魚朝恩領神策軍，朝廷把武力交托給宦官，自是政出宦官之門，皇帝的廢立，宰相的布政，都要聽命於宦官了。所以唐朝兵制之壞，先壞於禁軍；政治之壞，也先壞於神策軍軍權的轉移，不當列入藩鎭的賬目中。　　藩鎭的產生，和外宼的侵迫有相當的闗係。因爲更迭宿衛京師的府兵，（名曰番上）至唐高宗中宗之際，變成擺樣子的裝飾品。玄宗天實初年，感到外患的嚴重。於是沿邊置十節度經略使。那些持節的都督，本來也是臨時的主帥；直到安史亂後，討賊有功的將領和賊將來隆的都請他们做節熊使，這樣乃開始藩鎭割據的局面。藩鎭的德政是不待說的，把持地方行政，父子世襲職位，節度使與節度使之間日弄干戈，弄得民窮財盡。但必說藩鎭弄兵比宦官把恃禁軍的罪惡更大，卽歐陽修也還不肯這樣說。</p>
<p>古語曰：去　猶火也，不戢將自焚。當所謂名將郭子儀，李光弼率領禁軍浩浩蕩蕩殺　西京的時候，官軍共有十五萬，其中回紇軍不過四千人，必得有這四千回紇軍方能收復西京，豈不是一件奇蹟？後來相州之役，禁軍府兵共六十萬人，不可謂不多；却給史思明的三萬兵殺得一敗塗地了。最奇妙的，黄巢登高一呼，貧農紛起，横行南北數萬里，如入無人之地；幾乎直入潼闗，危及京師。若非李克用帶着沙陀韃靼兵來勤王，黄巢也早定鼎長安了。本來是聲吼如雷的小花臉，忽然在台角上扮丑角演起喜劇來，不獨看客哄營大笑，演戲的自己也覺得有些滑稽。五代之季，藩鎭武劇快近收場，南唐，後蜀皆有偃武修文傾向；趙匡胤以武人纂帝位，也想請趙普以半部論語治天下，杯酒釋禁軍石守信，藩鎭王彥超的兵炳，武力的夢總算做醒了。</p>
<p>新近和一位久役戎行的朋友暢談世事，他慨然道：（我们這個）行當），已經快要天亮了！）我聽了他這句話，想起另一位戰士丨替人流血過的丨所作的神仙，老虎，狗，騎士時代的英雄眞的將以吉河德先生的典型出現了嗎？</p>
<h3>淺湖（八</h3>
<p>— 英國約瑟康拉德作　侍　桁　譯</p>
<p>阿薩特以一種更平而低的聲調繼續着講。</p>
<p>（我们到了一個好像遮住我们的去路的，靠近陸地的長海　的小灣，我们把船推到那白色的砂灘上。這個長長海　遥遥地衝進海裹。我的哥哥認識那個地方的。在海神　的那一面，有一個河口，而且貫穿着那海　的草叢，有一條狹窄的道路。我们焚起了火，燒了一些飯。於是我们睡在柔軟的砂地上，隠身在小舟的陰影下，同時她在張望着。我還没有合上我的眼，就聽到她驚呌的聲音。我们跳起來，太陽，在天上已經半傾斜着了，從海灣的入口處我们看見一只帆船載着許多水手。我们立刻就明白了；那是我们的酋長的帆船。他们正向海岸上張望，隨後看見我们了。他们敲着銅鑼，把帆船的頸轉向海灣裹來。我覺得我胸中的心臓變得軟弱了。黛亞美倫坐在砂地上，用手遮住她的面孔。從海上是没有逃走的路的。我的哥哥大笑着。當你臨走的時候，屠安，你給過他一支槍，他是拿在手中的，然而只有很少的火藥。他很快地對我講：（伴着她沿着這條小路跑。我可以替你们截後，因爲他们没有槍械，而且面對着一個手裹拿着槍的人上陸，那他们一定是尋死的。快同着她跑吧。在森林的那一邊，有一家漁夫的房子，還有一隻小船。我把所有的火藥射完了的時候，便馬上隨着你们來。我跑得很快，在他们没有趕到之前，我们就可以逃走。我能夠支持多久便支持多久，因爲她是一個婦人，旣不能跑又不能打仗，可是在她的軟弱的手中却握住了你的心。）他曲身在小舟的後面。帆船來到了。我和她跑起來，當我们沿着小道向前衝去的時候，我聽見了槍聲。我们哥哥開着槍，天次，兩次，於是槍聲停止了。留在我们背後的是寂靜。這海　是狹窄的。我還没有聽到我的哥哥開第三槍時，我巳見到那傾斜的海濱，我又看見了水：一條大河的河口。我们穿過了森林中的一片草地。我们跑下水去。我看見在黑泥地上有一間低低的小屋，繫着一隻小船。在我的背後，我又聽見了一次槍聲。我心裹想：（這是他最後的一槍了。）我们衝上了小船；一個人從小屋裹跑出來，可是我跳在他身上，我们一起滾進泥地裹，當我站起來時，他就靜靜地躺在我的脚下了。我也不曉得我是否已經殺死了他。我和黛亞美倫推開了小舟。我聽見我身後的呌嚷聲，我看見我的哥哥穿過了森林中的草地。許多人尾隨在他的身後。我把她抱起來，投上了船，接着我自己也跳了進去。我再回過頭來看時，我的哥哥倒在地上了。他倒下又起來，可是有許多人緊緊地　上了他。他大聲呌着，（我來了！）人们緊跟着他。我一看，有許多人。於是我看看她。屠安。我推開了船！我把船推到水深的地方。她正跪在船首，眼望着我，於是我說，（拿起你的槳來。）當我拿着槳划水的時候，屠安，我聽見他在呌着了。我聽見他兩次呌着我的名字；同時我還聽見這樣呌嚷的聲音，（殺呀！打呀！）我總没有轉回頭去。我又聽見他銳聲地呌着我的名字，這時他的聲音和他的生命一同靜息了丨可是我永没有轉回我的頭去。我自己的名字呀！……我的哥哥！他三次呼喚着我丨但我不是因爲愛惜生命。她不是在那船裡麽？我同着她不是可以找到一塊國土，那里忘去了死亡，那里不知道死亡！）</p>
<p>那個白人坐直了身子。阿薩特也站立起來，在熄滅的餘燼的火熖上，映出一條漠糊的沈默的身姿。在湖上，雲霧低低地飄浮着，慢慢消滅了那繁星的閃光的影子而展開。現在有一大片濛濛的白氣遮蓋了地面：它在黑暗中冷森森地融流着，無聲地形成渦卷圍繞了樹幹，圍繞了那房屋的竹臺，以致使那房屋像是漂浮在大海的不安的動盪的幻像上似的。只是在遠方，在繁星閃爍的天空上，樹梢畫出了明淅的輪廓，像是陰鬱不可到達的海岸丨無情的黑暗的海岸。</p>

        <h1>1933.09.18</h1>
<h3>The Second Anniversary of the September 18th Incident</h3>
<p>The September 18th Incident. Today marks its second anniversary. During the first anniversary commemoration last year, the press unanimously expressed grief and indignation, believing that as the nation faced such a crisis, the people should make the ultimate sacrifice and fundamental efforts to fight for the nation's survival. The most impassioned voices declared, "If we do not mobilize the nation's manpower and resources with the greatest determination to struggle for survival from death, even if the Chinese people claim that China will not perish, the powerful enemy will undoubtedly have the means to bring about its demise." If the Chinese people could find and read the commemorative addresses from various publications a year ago today, and compare them with the current severe situation, I believe there would be many who would weep tears of despair.</p>
<p>In the past year, the violent aggression of the powerful enemy has come to a temporary halt. Now, they are shifting their approach to aggression, seeking to achieve their ultimate goals through political control and diplomatic coercion. From another perspective, after the Tanggu Truce, one-ninth of China's territory and one-sixteenth of its people were completely excluded from the 5,000 square mile demilitarized zone. Even if the people wanted to make the ultimate sacrifice and fundamental efforts, they would be hindered and unable to begin. So, what words can we use today to encourage each other?</p>
<p>However, if the people can truly recognize the severity of the national crisis since the September 18th Incident, then the direction of our struggle should not be limited to the local area of Northeast China, nor should it be confined to the recovery of lost territory. Instead, we should seek a path of struggle within the overall issue of the survival of the Chinese nation. The current storm of aggression has already encroached upon the life of the entire Chinese nation. In recent months, Japan has threatened China's national actions with wild rhetoric and dispatched officials to conduct surveillance. The facts are clear and present: the sovereignty of the entire nation has become the enemy's target for the second stage of aggression. The entire territory and all the people are being enveloped by this powerful enemy's second stage of aggression. Even if the people do not want to struggle, they have no choice. When a nation is subjected to subjugation and cannot exert all its strength to resist, the consequences are clearly recorded in various histories of national destruction. It seems unnecessary for us to laboriously cite them, as they are already well known to the people.</p>
<p>Regarding words of mutual encouragement and inspiration, we exhausted ourselves in their expression during the first anniversary of the national crisis. The effect they produced can be seen as a negative example in the fact that the national crisis has only worsened over the past year. As we reach the second anniversary of the national crisis, repeating these old words seems unnecessary. We will now simply ask a single question: "Do the people still have the will to fight?"</p>
<h3>Second Anniversary of the September 18th Incident Wei.</h3>
<p>Time flows most easily past the eyes of those who are decadent, complacent, and forgetful. The tragic September 18th Incident has now reached its second anniversary in the blink of an eye. Two years means that the change in color of half of the Northeast's mountains and rivers has been two years. The submersion of 30 million compatriots in the Northeast in water and fire has been two years. The pain of being slaughtered that we have endured has been two years. Today, across the country, there will certainly be solemn commemorative meetings as usual. However, the swallows on the eaves are unaware of the impending danger. Time passes quickly. What practical actions and preparations have we made in the past two years? What reflections and awakenings have we had? Today, as we commemorate the past, we should examine the present. If we have done none of these things, then we are too busy being sorrowful for the present to have time to grieve for the past. With others wielding the knife and the chopping board, we are the fish and the meat. If we do not plan now, what can we imagine for the future? By the time the third anniversary arrives, we may still be able to commemorate as usual. But after three or more years, we may not even be able to commemorate as usual.</p>
<p>Looking back to the time from the outbreak of the September 18th disaster to today, the national crisis has increased with each passing day. When the September 18th Incident broke out, the Yangtze River region was suffering from floods. Japan took advantage of our crisis and added a sharp blade to our wounds. Last year, on the first anniversary of the September 18th Incident, the scars of the disaster had not yet healed, and Japan's aggression intensified, leading to the loss of even more beautiful territory. As of today, although Japan has temporarily halted its aggressive steps, the area north of the Great Wall is no longer ours. Furthermore, the Yellow River region has again suffered from floods. Old wounds have not healed, and new pains have arrived. The increasing severity of the national crisis is due to poor planning and has resulted in the current situation of continuous decline. Looking back and then forward, it is truly heartbreaking and infuriating.</p>
<p>I also remember that when the September 18th Incident first broke out, the entire nation was once filled with激昂generosity and the momentum of奮發acting with a purpose. Those in power in the government were filled with grief and indignation, repeatedly and solemnly announcing to the nation that resisting Japan and saving the country was the priority. On the people's side, the Northeast Volunteer Army was flourishing like wildfire. People raised funds and provided assistance, striving to be the first. However, now, only two years later, although the Volunteer Army continues to fight, the assistance has dwindled. The voice of resistance against Japan can no longer be heard. We seem to have forgotten the enormous shame and pain that we should never forget and never be willing to forget, as if nothing has happened. Is our nation truly a nation that easily forgets? Now, those in power are again using enriching national strength, emulating Goujian's forbearance and bearing the burden of humiliation, and focusing on 生聚敎訓to show to the nation. This is indeed the right path to self-help and self-salvation. However, based on past examples, we cannot help but feel apprehensive about the long night ahead. How can we be sure that today's 生聚敎訓will not become a temporary expediency in the future? The fierce lion is asleep, and the sound dream does not awaken. The serious injury and great shame have already been two years old, but the political disturbances are still the same. The people's complacency is still the same. The state of disorganization and lack of planning are all still the same. So, will our hopes for the future also be the same?</p>
<p>However, the past is gone. Pointless blame and pointless commemoration are both meaningless. Neither can挽救salvage the already completed facts of the past. In short, rather than mourning the past, we should seize the present. Only the present is most reliable. Just like lying on firewood and tasting gall, like 生聚敎訓, all declarations of 發奮圖强and all solemn and警策oath words should all start with the present and be the boundary stone between the old and the new. It is not too late to mend the fence after a sheep has been lost. We silently observe the situation and are willing to sincerely contribute our humble opinions.</p>
<p>First, today's leaders advocate安内to攘外. But how can the internal be secured? This certainly cannot be achieved through mere words. We believe that the source of chaos lies not in the people's love of chaos, but in politics and economics. If politics cannot be put on the right track, then the officialdom cannot be clean. Excessive taxes are levied on the people, and the people have nowhere to escape death. This is the direct influence of politics. Due to the invasion of capitalist economics, the exploitation of feudal forms, and the frequent occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, the countryside is increasingly bankrupt. The emerging industries in the cities are also declining due to the bankruptcy of the countryside. The number of unemployed and hungry people is uncountable. Since the people have no way to make a living, they cannot help but band together and take risks. This is also the direct influence of economics. Therefore, if we want to secure the internal today, we must thoroughly reform politics and show the people sincerity and trustworthiness. We must look at everything from a grand perspective, without embellishment or hypocrisy, and act practically, following the rules in all our actions. We must improve official integrity to rectify the綱紀, clarify right and wrong to establish威信, and reduce excessive taxes to ease the people's difficulties. All measures should be taken with an attitude of openness, fairness, and impartiality. Only then will politics be正, and only then will we be able to治. In economics, we must take planned actions with the utmost sincerity and determination to support the development of industry and agriculture, strictly prohibit opium, and strictly prohibit exploitation under巧立名目pretext. Even when introducing foreign capital and borrowing foreign technical talents, we must adhere to the principle of benefiting the people. Once politics is正and the economy can embark on the road to recovery, then the people's livelihood can recover, social order can be stabilized, chaos can be quelled, bandits can be eliminated, the internal can be secured, and the purpose of "安内攘外" can be realized. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Second, everyone says that Japan's seizing of Northeast China is no different from swallowing a bomb. However, they have already swallowed this bomb. The resources of Northeast China are now Japan's outer treasury. The mountains and rivers of Northeast China are now Japan's屏障. Yet, their ambition is still not satisfied. They take the iron from Anshan to replenish military needs, the coal from Fushun to provide fuel, and the accumulated sorghum and soybeans to provide food and forage. They use what they take from us to harm us. Therefore, after seizing Northeast China, Japan's strength has increased, and its ambition has become more肆. In terms of environment, the contradictions are deepening daily, and they have no choice but to resort to war as the only way to resolve the contradictions. Today, their military expenditure has increased sharply compared to last year. They are more actively engaged in expanding their military. What is the purpose of their high-pitched cry for an East Asian Monroe Doctrine? Therefore, we must not think that Japan has already achieved its goal and satisfied its desire after seizing Northeast China and will definitely not cross the Great Wall to the south without pre-planning and 作事先之策劃. We must not close our eyes and wait for them to slaughter us. "Past events, if not forgotten, are a guide for later events." The great difficulties of the future are upon us, and we should urgently 作未雨之綢繆. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Third, not only should we actively guard against the aggressive actions of our eastern neighbor, we should also urgently prepare for it ourselves. The situation in the Far East has now entered a dangerous state of狂风雨驟. Due to Japan's seizure of Northeast China, various countries in the Pacific Ocean are also剑拔弩张 and怒目相向. The competition between the United States and Japan in building warships and the accelerating increase in military expenditure are very obvious. Even between Japan and the Soviet Union, there is a constant 山雨欲來风满楼situation. The war in the Far East is imminent. All that is awaited is more complete preparation. Once the war breaks out, we will not be able to閉關自守, ignoring it and remaining silent. Furthermore, we will not have the strength to defend and save ourselves. Therefore, we can only be swept into the vortex of the miserable tide. Our land will be used as a battlefield, our people will be used as slaves, and our resources will be taken at will. Everything will be subject to their control and trampled upon. The misery at that time will be unimaginable. Our nation will be plunged</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>into an abyss from which it will never recover. Therefore, today, when we talk about self-defense and self-salvation, we should not only focus on our eastern neighbor. How to deal with the future war in the Far East is also a matter that urgently needs planning today. This is the third point. In short, today, when we commemorate the September 18th Incident, we should all first默思and first反省. What is the purpose of commemoration? If it is merely for點綴, merely to照例, and merely for the哀悼of feelings, then commemoration is futile and meaningless, and each week will be worse than the last. We can only quietly wait to perish together. If not, then陈死新生. Please start today. Say less empty words and bury ourselves in practical work. By this time next year, perhaps our commemoration will not be merely the weak呻吟 and the pitiable sight of 流涙痛哭. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." The fate of our nation in the future lies in our struggle and preparation today.</p>
<h3>A Retrospective and Prospective View of the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>| The Causes and Consequences of the Fall of the Three Northeast Provinces |</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of the Three Northeast Provinces is now a historical fact. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Japan seized Korea and actively prepared to invade the Three Northeast Provinces. After winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan not only seized the rights that Russia had forcibly taken from China in southern Manchuria but also expanded its economic and political influence along the South Manchurian Railway. For example, the coal in Fushun, the iron in Anshan, the textiles in Benxi Lake, the stationing of troops along the South Manchurian Railway, and the opening of奉天省城 as a commercial port, and the extension of the Jichang Railway to Huining in Korea, were all very obvious facts of Japanese imperialism's invasion of the Three Northeast Provinces. In the Qing Dynasty, the so-called princes and ministers neither understood the enemy's situation nor knew their own position. Therefore, when Russia and Japan fought in Chinese territory, they were still talking about 风凉话and maintaining neutrality. After the establishment of the Republic of China, our national capital gradually developed. However, the local warlords still did not have a correct understanding of the country or the nation. Although they deeply felt the pressure of foreign forces in the Three Northeast Provinces, they were still unwilling to abandon their personal interests to fulfill the historical mission of national revolution.</p>
<p>However, the development of national capital in the Three Northeast Provinces cannot be erased. Therefore, the Fenghai Railway and the Tao'ang Railway were both successfully built with Chinese capital. This was an inevitable trend and also threatened Japanese imperialists, fundamentally shaking their so-called special interests in the Three Northeast Provinces. At that time, the situations in Britain and the United States were slightly different from today. Because capitalism in Britain and the United States had reached a relatively high level of development, the emerging capital of the colonies and semi-colonies was not enough to compete with them. Although Japan claimed to be an imperialist country with a monopoly of financial capital, its main industry was still the textile industry. Among its exported manufactured goods, textile products were the most important. Therefore, the economic development of the Three Northeast Provinces was very frightening to Japan. Unfortunately, in politics, the old authorities in the Three Northeast Provinces did not understand this relationship and did not have any political preparations. They only had some unhealthy resentment towards Japan. Therefore, once an incident occurred, they had no means of self-defense.</p>
<p>What was especially obvious was in June of the 20th year of the Republic of China, when Uchida Kosai completed his term as President of the South Manchurian Railway, and Ugaki Kazushige became the Governor-General of Korea. The Japanese military also openly expressed its intention to have a積極plan. At that time, if the authorities in the Three Northeast Provinces could have動製機先, they might have been able to prevent the military actions of the Japanese militarists. It was still possible to keep the Three Northeast Provinces intact. Unexpectedly, they因循坐誤and waited until the bomb exploded on the night of September 18th before they惊惶了起来and said that a national disaster had arrived.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that Japan's sudden launch of military action was an act of aggression. They tore up all international conventions and destroyed all international credibility. However, why could our Three Northeast Provinces not be recovered, and Japan was able to advance step by step, occupying the Three Northeast Provinces and attacking Rehe, achieving considerable success? What is the reason for this? The lesson we have learned from the facts of the past two years is that our Chinese nation is indeed a bit衰老. Some people underestimate the strong enemy in front of them, while others are excessively畏懼. They only focus on personal development and try to show their strengths as much as possible. They do not整肅or have truly effective expressions for collective development, especially the activities of the entire nation. The Volunteer Army in the Three Northeast Provinces had a轟轟烈烈 struggle. Unfortunately, it was only one-sided, and those in the safe areas behind the lines seemed to be doing nothing, not acting like they were in the midst of a life-and-death struggle. Only during the January 28th Incident did Shanghai and its vicinity truly have a wartime atmosphere. However, they soon returned to their old ways of singing and dancing. Although this is a small matter and seems unimportant, from the enemy's point of view, they have learned about our national character and have made various plans to deal with us. Second, there was no firm decision on whether the policy should be war or peace. When it came to war, because our national strength was weak, the people's livelihood was dilapidated, and the financial resources were not enough for foreign wars. And the method of resisting on the spot, with the military strength of a local part, was certainly not comparable to the use of the entire national strength. So, the result was that we heard of victories every day, but we were shortening the front line and losing territory every day. Third, in this difficult situation, we had a big disadvantage, which was that we overvalued the League of Nations, believing that the League of Nations had the power to decisively裁制Japan. And we thought that the actual interests of the League of Nations member states, such as Britain and France, would inevitably conflict with Japan. In terms of personnel, the representatives of various countries also showed good feelings towards China. We thought that this was the way to deal with Japan. However, the countries of the world at that time, such as the United States, were indeed in opposition to Japan and should be able to restrain Japan. But they were struggling with an economic panic and could not break through their own difficulties. Where did they have the strength to help China deal with Japan? As for the League of Nations, it was originally an empty moral institution and a mechanism manipulated by the five permanent members. It had no power to裁制the military atrocities of any powerful country. This is a well-known fact, and we should never hope to reason with it. Even if we reasoned and got justice, there was no way to implement it. Moreover, how much understanding did Britain and Japan have about the Northeast Incident before? Therefore, it was delayed again and again until Japanese imperialism had completed its deployment. The League of Nations had no power to stop it, and we Chinese were helpless. Anyone who does not have the strength to hope for help from others will ultimately not have results. The matter of appealing to the League of Nations on the Three Northeast Provinces issue is an example.</p>
<p>Due to the deepening of the world economic panic, the opposition between the various capitalist imperialist countries has become more intense, especially the disputes caused by the division of the Far East market. Japan believes that since it has been successful in (Manchuria) and flaunted its military power in North China, it will turn to sweep the Yangtze River basin and even invade Australia. The Philippines and Guam are even more within its grasp. Not only that, but Japan also wants to cross Hong Kong, step into the South Seas Islands, pass through Singapore, and monopolize the Indian market. Because the result of seizing the Three Northeast Provinces for two years has not achieved Japan's original extravagant hopes, it has not solved the economic panic currently facing Japanese imperialism. Instead, it has increased the burden on the general people of Japan due to the use of troops, causing Japanese farmers to have debts of more than 1,000 yen per household. Japanese militarism has not觉悟到that all of its previous actions were its own mistakes. Instead, it believes that those are its means of aggression, has not到家, and the troops are not enough. At the same time, it believes that the continental policy is not satisfactory. Therefore, it wants to extend another hand to the ocean. So its budget for next year includes a particularly large naval expansion fee, totaling 680 million yen.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the South Seas Islands feel a great threat, and it is not just a matter of economic and trade superiority. It will also fundamentally shake Britain's rule over the above-mentioned areas. At the same time, the United States, which wants to develop the Far East market, will inevitably encounter the iron fist of the Japanese navy. And the Philippines will inevitably face a great danger. The United States is doing its best to expand its navy and air force. This is obviously a matter of course. On the other hand, there is Siberia, which Japan's continental policy is directed at. In name and in fact, it is something that Britain, the United States, and other countries like to see. To blockade the Soviet Union and occupy Siberia. From the perspective of the army alone, Japan seems to be confident. However, the vast plains of Siberia, with hundreds of thousands or even millions of troops stationed there, may not have much effect. Moreover, the current Soviet Union is different from before. If Japan dares to risk it again, it will inevitably encounter the iron cold lesson.</p>
<p>However, Japan has caught the fever of war. Even if it encounters the minimum peaceful lessons of the Pacific coastal countries, it has not shown the slightest sign of awakening. Instead, it is intensifying its aggressive actions. For example, the establishment of an economic staff department in the headquarters of the Kwantung Army, the change of the Japanese army in the Three Northeast Provinces into a permanent division, and the expansion of the May's military construction plan, building a total of 33 aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc., within three years, and also 8 air teams. Who can believe its verbal expressions of peace with such expressions? At this critical moment, the enemy is approaching step by step. Can we forget the lost Three Northeast Provinces? Can we ignore the enemy's offensive policy again? Can we not urgently rise up to defend ourselves? Of course, we know that the relationship with Japan cannot be resolved in a short period of time. In fact, it will inevitably become a historical and constant national struggle. If this great national struggle is still conducted in the same way as before, only using personal abilities, then the final victory will still not be guaranteed. We must work hard on collective organization and forging, training out new vitality from the struggle of the aging national character. We must gather our own vitality, use collective action, and fight with the militarists who are about to set. Then the final victory will surely be ours.</p>

<h3>An Earnest Appeal to the Nation from Northeastern Soldiers Remaining in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Unbearable Memories of the Fall of the Three Northeastern Provinces: Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, and Su Bingwen Rose Up to Resist Japan, but Their Efforts Ended in Failure</p>
<p>From Now On, We Should Strive Diligently to Become Strong and Recover Our Lost Territories</p>
<p>Northeastern Anti-Japanese soldiers detained in Xinjiang have issued an earnest appeal to the nation to commemorate the second anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation Incident. It details the anti-Japanese struggles of Generals Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, Su Bingwen, Wang Delin, and Feng Zhanhai, and emphasizes that we should strive diligently to become strong and jointly resist foreign aggression. The original text is filled with grief, every word stained with tears. It is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Alas, what day is this? Is it not the second anniversary of the national humiliation since the September 18th Incident? As I pick up the pen to write, I cannot help but feel my hands weaken and my pen tremble. Sorrow wells up from within, making me unable to write a single word. I want to speak, but a thousand things are hard to express. It is a day of crying without sound and weeping without tears. If crying has reached the point of being silent, and weeping has reached the point of being tearless, then the hardships and suffering of the past two years, the shocking and tragic scenes, must be unspeakable. Although time has passed and circumstances have changed, how can we, the armed comrades of the Northeast Anti-Japanese forces, forget it for even a moment?</p>
<p>Recalling the night of September 18th two years ago, the powerful enemy, under the false pretense of destroying the South Manchuria Railway, fabricated rumors and, acting like bandits, launched an unprovoked war without a declaration. They seized our Shenyang, attacked our military camps, and seized our arsenals, airfields, provincial treasury, and banks, looting everything. The essence of the Northeast, built up over twenty years with the people's hard-earned wealth, was wiped out in one fell swoop. At the same time, they advanced on Changchun. Two days later, the provincial capital of Jilin also fell. Not content with this, they further coveted Longsha. Fortunately, Chairman Ma Zhanshan personally led his elite troops in a head-on attack, resulting in the Jiangqiao Campaign. Although it did not achieve complete success, it was enough to blunt their arrogance and diminish their courage. Eventually, due to numerical inferiority, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang also fell. At that time, the whole country was in an uproar and public sentiment was aroused. After the incident, Commander-in-Chief Li Du of Jilin met Chairman Ma Zhanshan on a boat on the Songhua River. They agreed and resolved to resist and not succumb to the puppet government. As the situation in northern Manchuria became increasingly urgent, they united with friendly forces and advanced on Harbin, where they, along with Commander-in-Chief Ding Chao, organized the United Headquarters of the Self-Defense Army and the Railway Protection Army to resist the powerful enemy in the suburbs of Harbin. After more than ten days of fierce fighting, morale was boosted, and popular sentiment was stirred up, dramatically changing the situation. Subsequently, due to lack of reinforcements, they retreated east to Fangzheng and Yanshou. At the same time, they advanced and occupied Zhuhe and Yimianpo, recovering Ning'an and Mishan counties. The enemy then pressed on with heavy forces. After two months of fierce fighting, they retreated to the east of Mudanjiang. When the League of Nations investigation team went north, our troops were launching a multi-pronged counterattack on Harbin and Jilin. Soon, the Songhua River thawed, and the strong enemy used land, sea, and air forces to move downstream, seizing our Yilan. After more than twenty days of fierce fighting, our army lacked defenses against the river. The counties along the Songhua River then fell into enemy hands. The troops of Feng Zhanhai and Yang Yaojun were cut off in the west and had no choice but to retreat to the nine counties of Muling and Dongbian, where they organized militias, fought in their respective areas, and persevered for eight months. Eventually, the weather turned cold, the soldiers lacked winter clothing, and they fought and retreated, painfully withdrawing into Russian territory. After a year of hard fighting, they ended in utter poverty. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Commander Wang Delin of the Jilin National Salvation Army firmly defended Dongning and Ning'an counties, cutting off enemy supply lines and preventing enemy reinforcements. There were battles every month. They never allowed the enemy to complete the Huining Railway. Commander-in-Chief Su Bingwen of the Heilongjiang National Salvation Army inflicted a major blow on the Japanese forces in the battles of Zhalantun and other places. Gloomy clouds and tragic mist filled the air, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. Fathers held their sons, brothers held their younger siblings, and women and children supported each other, displaced and homeless. Countless people died under the hail of bullets and the explosions of airplanes. In addition, many intellectuals were massacred by the Japanese under various pretexts. Armed comrades, lacking sources of supplies and ammunition, going hungry in the summer and lacking clothing in the winter, still fought hard for years, regarding death as going home. They believed that only in this way could they fulfill their duty and thank their elders. It is evident that their patriotic spirit came from sincere enthusiasm. Although they suffered at that time, they felt it was better than today. At that time, they stood on the soil of the Northeast, and what they wore and ate were the silk and grain of the Northeast. They sought a living on the battlefield, wearing armor and wielding weapons, still hoping for recovery. Now, they have passed through the Soviet Union and retreated into Xinjiang, almost starving to death.</p>
<p>Alas, there is no way to volunteer to serve the country, and we can only cry out to heaven in helplessness. We are determined to avenge our shame, but can only shed tears of despair on our impoverished journey. The mountains and passes are difficult to cross, and who will hear our voices? Our country is broken, and our homes are destroyed, our hearts are torn apart. Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel deep sorrow. Our beautiful land has been invaded, and our fields and graves are trampled by the enemy. They violate public treaties and are inhumane. As the saying goes, "Worry and labor can build a country, while ease and pleasure can destroy it." The Japanese have already dealt us a major blow, and we should have a deep understanding of this. "Do not forget the past, it is a teacher for the future." If the hearts of the people are not completely dead, we should learn from the pain, strive diligently to become strong, and not fail this day of profound sorrow, in order to avenge our shame in the future. If we continue to be divided, and seek after conflict, only knowing the struggle for power, and not knowing the pain of national destruction, then I fear that the future holds even more unspeakable days.</p>
<h3>Li Chunrun Rises Up to Resist Japan Amidst Commemoration</h3>
<p>Despite Severed Supplies, He Battles the Enemy Day and Night</p>
<p>Japanese Major General Takezawa Beheaded in the Battle of Tagou</p>
<p>A certain military leader of the righteous army who recently arrived from the Northeast seeking aid has provided a very detailed account of the recent activities of the righteous army in the Northeast, and has also produced a letter he carried southward to report to a certain party. The original text reads: "(Recently received a letter from the secretary of Li Chunrun's unit stating: 'To all members of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association: Recently received an important letter from Commander Li Zirong of the former 35th Route Army, personally delivered from Fengcheng. The letter reads: 'Dear brothers Huiquan and Zhongxue: Since our army's ammunition landed, the Japanese and puppet authorities have paid great attention, and the atmosphere among the troops stationed in various places has suddenly become tense. On one hand, they ordered a blockade, and on the other hand, they sent reinforcements. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers and two thousand six or seven hundred puppet soldiers have arrived in Feng territory one after another. Fortunately, our soldiers and officers have fought valiantly and repeatedly achieved extraordinary feats (detailed battle reports have been submitted separately). Because the Japanese army suffered heavy blows repeatedly, they increased reinforcements step by step and, on August 17, used an encirclement plan to pressure our army. At 8:00 AM that morning, about 300 Japanese soldiers were found in Shajinchang advancing towards our side. At that time, our army only had the full strength of Ao's division and the special service regiment (only two machine guns and two mortars), and the garrison of the headquarters. The rest of Shao's entire command, and the 6th Infantry Regiment under Commander Yu and the 7th Regiment under Commander Wang, were ordered on the 15th of this month to go to Sidaizi, Fenghuangcheng, Gaolimen, Tangshan, and other places to carry out sabotage work. The support detachment commander was also ordered on the 13th to go to Shalisai and Shaozihe to clear out the Japanese and puppet troops stationed there, in order to link up with Commander Liu of Xiuyan. After our army detected the enemy's situation, it immediately led troops to meet the enemy. At 10:00 AM, we made contact with the Japanese army and held our position for about two hours. The Japanese army sent three bombers and three fighter planes from Andong to bombard our army fiercely and strafe in circles. At the same time, over 200 Japanese soldiers arrived from Dali Jiabaozi and over 300 Japanese soldiers arrived from Yangshuipao. After our army fought bravely, Commander Li personally led the garrison to attack the left flank of the enemy at about 3:00 PM. The fighting between the two sides was exceptionally fierce. Our side suffered the loss of one battalion commander, two adjutants, three company commanders, and eight soldiers. More than ten officers and soldiers were wounded. All the wounded soldiers are now receiving treatment in secret locations. However, due to financial constraints, there is a lack of medicine, and because the Japanese and Manchurian armies are searching too strictly, medical treatment is quite inconvenient (omitted). On August 19, in the Battle of Tagou, one Japanese Major General Commander Takezawa, one Captain Nakagawa, one Captain Iwahara, and 57 soldiers were killed. In addition, Lieutenant Colonel Ito was wounded (rumor has it that he has died from his injuries). There are no accurate statistics on the wounded Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, I previously sent Wang Shoushan to report everything to XX, but I don't know if he arrived. Yesterday (the 28th), Commander Li of our army sent Chief Quartermaster Zhao Duosan to XX to report that Commander Li was leading the troops to attack the enemy in the battle against the enemy in Taman on August 17 when he was wounded in the upper left leg by a hand grenade thrown by a Japanese soldier. The wound was about three inches deep, with fractured bones and flesh flying everywhere, and blood flowing non-stop. Commander Li Zirong commanded the troops on one hand and sent troops to escort him down the mountain on the other. He is currently receiving treatment in a secret location. According to the doctors, he needs half a month to fully recover. However, because enemy troops are searching everywhere and funds are unavailable, treatment is quite inconvenient. Commander Li Zirong has now dispersed the troops under his command to various locations to carry out training, as the troops are too exhausted. He recently advocated avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, striving to preserve the existing strength. The military region headquarters is moving around in various places and is extremely secretive. As for political work, it has not been suspended due to the war, and the slight achievements are the liaison with the puppet army and the reorganization of the puppet army. The puppet troops in Feng territory initially stubbornly resisted our army, but later, seeing the bravery of our soldiers, the sufficiency of our strength, and the strictness of our discipline, they voluntarily cooperated and no longer resisted. The matter has been discovered by the Japanese, who are planning to solve it to vent their anger. Previously, a large number of puppet troops successively mutinied, and more than 500 people have been reorganized by our army. There are still many who are waiting for our army to go and distribute supplies before returning. He Jianmang, the commander of the puppet suppression bandits, has also secretly sent representatives to our army, mutually agreeing not to invade, etc. He also said that his trip to X is to appeal to all parties for the following: (1) Quickly allocate a large sum of money and send someone to distribute it. (2) Immediate compensation for wounded and fallen soldiers. (3) Replenish weapons and ammunition. (4) As the weather is getting cold early outside the customs, quickly raise clothing. (5) Please issue destructive equipment and hand grenades, and send someone to guide the destruction work, etc. Deyu believes that the two gentlemen Cheng Huiquan and Wang Shoushan are in X and will naturally make considerable efforts. He has left Zhao in X to wait for a solution. He should truthfully forward the request for your attention and coordinated assistance, so as to consolidate the morale of the army. The anti-Japanese future is deeply dependent on this. I am writing this urgently, and I cannot express my respect enough, waiting for orders, etc.' I secretly believe that Li Chunrun, after the Tanggu Agreement, embraced full of grief and indignation, and generously went out of the customs. At the time of departure, his ambition was the same as Yishui. When my brothers and I bid farewell at Yangguan, we all shed tears. After arriving in the East, he immediately summoned his old troops, went to various places to contact Li Zirong, Liu Jingwen, Deng Tiemei, etc., and gathered more than 6,000 troops. After the ammunition given by our association arrived, they launched large-scale activities in Andong, Fengcheng, Xiuyan, Zhuanghe, and Benxi, repeatedly defeating the Japanese and puppet coalition forces. Their momentum was greater than that of Tang Juhua in the summer of the year before last. Therefore, the Japanese increased the deployment of large numbers of land, sea (patrolling along the coast and the Yalu River), and air forces, surrounding them on all sides. Li Chunrun personally led his troops to confront them, and after more than two months, the Japanese army had no advantage. At this time when there is no one to save the country, Mr. Li and others generously took an oath, bravely killed the enemy, and repeatedly frustrated the enemy's intentions, making the enemy dare not look at them. Their loyalty and courage, how can we not feel ashamed, how can we not do our best to run around and ask all parties for assistance? Therefore, I specially send this letter to you, earnestly asking you to consider, for the sake of reinvigorating the national spirit, for the sake of recovering the national territory, for the sake of saving 30 million people, to give strong support to this national hero and to supplement the items requested in the letter as appropriate. If the strength is sufficient, the natural dangers of the so-called triangular zone can be used to exist permanently, maintaining the so-called line of dawn of national salvation. Currently, Li's representative, Wang Shoushan, the head of the political affairs office of the headquarters, is crying for a solution in X, knocking on our door every day, because the ammunition he led has been used up and there will be no way to deal with the powerful enemy. Once the ammunition is exhausted and aid is cut off, not only will 6,000 heroes sacrifice for the country, but also the line of dawn of national salvation will be extinguished. Yan Yun: One rescue soldier is like putting out a fire, and if you miss it, it will be gone. Please, everyone, quickly plan it, without any expectations. Respectfully saluting you for safety, one.'</p>

<p>After Meeting, Fang Ji and Others Failed to Reach a Consensus: Fang Led His Troops Away from Dushikou; Ji Plans to Flee to Fengning to Join the Puppet Regime</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Postpones His Return to Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou Telegram: Liu Guitang received a telegram from Su to Guang saying that Fang Ji arrived in Baihe on the 16th, 60 li from Dushikou, bordering Fengning. After consultation, Fang Ji's opinions differed and his actions diverged. Liu's representative, Tian Gangyi, arrived in Zhangjiakou from Chicheng on the evening of the 16th. Fang led his troops away from Dushikou on the 15th and went east to the vicinity of Hongchengzi. His previous plan to join Liu Guitang failed. Ji's troops were surrounded by the Reds and there are rumors that they plan to flee to Fengning to join the puppet regime. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan was originally scheduled to leave Ping for Zhangjiakou tomorrow. However, as there are still many problems with the aftermath of the Chahar Bureau and resolving the issue of Fang Ji and others, he will submit them to the Standing Committee of the Military Sub-Council on the 20th for a concrete discussion. Song has rescheduled to return to Zhangjiakou with Qin Dechun, Guo Zhihan, and others on the 21st and will go to Zhangbei if necessary. Fang Ji's two units have crossed Dushikou and are still continuing to flee northeast. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Japanese planes scattering leaflets threatening our side and preparing to bomb Zhangjiakou, Japanese military officer Chayama telegraphed the Kwantung Army Headquarters yesterday, but no reply has been received in Ping to this day. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying said, "My trip south was to Shanghai, not to Lushan. When I passed through Nanjing on my way north, I met with Wang Jingwei and discussed the problems of North China. The current situation in North China is extremely complex, and there are many local incidents, which is truly not a blessing for the country. As for the Japanese planes scattering leaflets in Zhangjiakou, it is nothing more than a threat. Before I went south, our army had notified the Japanese side that it would enter Guyuan. Who knew that they would now use this as an excuse to send planes to Zhangjiakou? Their intention is nothing more than to expand the situation. The authorities have already negotiated with the Japanese side, which may be resolved. Yesterday, I received a telegram from Zhao Dengyu saying that his troops had stopped in Guyuan and were waiting for orders and had not advanced, nor did they intend to enter Dolun. Song has scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou on the 21st." (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Tang Yulin, Liu Guitang, and Zheng Guilin were ordered by the Japanese to organize a "Bandit Suppression Allied Army." Fang and others were appointed as commanders and made preparations for a reactionary move. The Japanese planes coming to Zhangjiakou to scatter leaflets, the Japanese army's refusal to allow our side to send troops to suppress bandits, the Japanese side's request to designate Guyuan and Dolun as buffer zones, and the Japanese army's refusal to withdraw from Miyun are all related to this matter. Currently, Li Shouxin and Zheng Guilin, the rebel troops, are all under the command of Liu Guitang. Foreign sources say that Fang Ji and others are willing to be used by the enemy and plan to advance in three routes from Miyun. Liu is the commander of the central route, Tang is on the left, and Ji is on the right. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Dengyu telegraphed Song on the 16th, saying that the Ningdian and Wu divisions were stationed west of Guyuan on the 16th, and the area was extremely peaceful. Another telegram on the 15th said that the puppet army under Li Shouxin was retreating towards Dolun, abandoning many items along the way. They are temporarily gathering near Guyuan, and the remaining bandits are intercepting and clearing them out. Tang has arrived near Dushikou with an unknown purpose. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Sub-Council will discuss the disposal of Fang Ji and the stationing locations and military expenses of the local armies at its regular meeting on the 20th, as well as the issue of implementing the streamlining of the armies. The main thing is that after the division system is changed, each division is planned to be changed to a two-regiment or three-regiment system, the brigade will be abolished, and most of them plan to request more five-division formations. The 41st Army has submitted a proposal to change to a three-division system, which will be submitted for discussion. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Luanzhou Bandit Suppression Issue Have Stalled</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army in Miyun is on High Alert</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Kwantung Army has not responded to the Luanzhou Bandit Suppression issue. Liu Shisun has been ill for two weeks after returning to Ping, causing the negotiations to stall. According to news on the road, about 3,000 bandits under the Laohaozi bandit gang near Qindao are moving from Qindao towards Yutian. They have looted all the places they have passed through, and the people have suffered heavy losses. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Miyun said that after the Hebei Provincial Government sent 120 security team members to Miyun, the 30 policemen previously borrowed from the Ping Municipality were handed over and returned to Ping. The Hebei Provincial Government also sent police to Ji and Huai counties to take over. More than 200 Japanese soldiers are stationed in Miyun and have not withdrawn. They set up posts on the streets every day, and the entrances and exits of the city gates are strictly checked. Pedestrians are prohibited from passing through the streets at night. The entrances and exits of Gubeikou are even more strictly checked. Residents outside the customs have recently heard that the Japanese plan to move residents from Chengde, Luanping, and Lingnan to the northeast, and move Korean people to Rehe, so they are all panicked and mostly fled into the customs. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Situation between Russia and the Puppet Regime is Deteriorating</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, recently, the Russian Far East Army has often crossed the border to cause trouble in the various fortresses around Heihe and has used 50 or 60 planes to practice bombing at the border between the two countries, threatening the people of the puppet state. Recently, the Soviet Russian authorities in Manzhouli and Heihe have declared to the puppet consuls stationed in various places that they will practice green gas on a certain day and asked them to close their doors for defense to avoid danger. The consulates saw that the Russians did not practice, which was obviously being fooled, so they opened their doors. The Russians then took the opportunity to release two rounds of green gas. The puppet consulates quickly closed their doors for defense, and the Russians stopped practicing. This has happened many times, which shows one aspect of the Russian attitude towards the puppet state. More than 3,000 Russian Red Army soldiers and more than 2,000 Korean independence army soldiers have entered the area east of Huadian, Jilin, fully armed with sufficient equipment and ammunition, seemingly wanting to rob the trains on the Jidun and Jihai Railways. According to local people, the joint army entered the country from Yanji, came under special Russian orders, and is waiting for an opportunity to act. Russia has prepared 220 aircraft two li from the Suifenhe Station, which often fly into the territory of the puppet state, causing great panic among the stationed Japanese troops.

<h3>The Inner Mongolian Princes' Conference</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The newly appointed Chahar Provincial Committee Member, Prince Mu Chu Ke Dong Pu Lu, returned to Inner Mongolia from Ping previously. On June 26, Prince De convened a meeting of the League Flags of Inner Mongolia and the banner heads of the Chahar and Xilingol Leagues, the Wumeng Zhabu League of Sui Province, and the Zhaowuda League of Re Province in Bailingmiao. After the meeting, they signed and telegraphed a notice. The government and the authorities are now paying attention to this issue. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Wang Has Returned to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei and Zeng Zhongming returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 9:30 PM on the 17th and got off the train at Hepingmen. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) President Wang, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 9:28 PM on the evening of the 17th and got off the train at Hepingmen. He went directly to his private residence in the Lingyuan. Wang told reporters from the Central News Agency that he had discussed the Economic Committee with Minister Song in Shanghai and had agreed on the draft articles of association and expansion plan. He will submit them to the Zhongzheng Committee this week for approval, and the committee will be established within the week. Song returned to Nanjing by customs patrol ship on the morning of the 17th and will arrive on the morning of the 18th. President Sun will return to Nanjing within the week. He met with Huang Yingbai twice in Shanghai. He has other matters to attend to and will not return north for the time being. The rumors of passivity are inaccurate. The government has a disposition plan for the Luanzhou Bandit Suppression issue, which is not difficult to resolve. Zeng said that Wang's main task in Shanghai was to discuss the Economic Committee with Song, which was very successful.

<h3>New Japanese Foreign Minister Reshapes Diplomatic Lineup</h3>
<p>Induce Understanding from China</p>
<p>Resolve Pending Issues with Russia</p>
<p>Scheduled to Attend Cabinet Meeting Tomorrow to Explain</p>
<p>(Tokyo) New Foreign Minister Hirota will present his aspirations and plans for Japan's foreign policy at the cabinet meeting on the 19th to seek understanding from the cabinet members, thereby advancing towards the goal of what New Foreign Minister Hirota calls "leap forward diplomacy." However, the diplomatic policy that Foreign Minister Hirota harbors, as an effective preparatory work for the diplomatic crisis of 1935, is to strengthen diplomacy based on the following fundamental principles, as can be clearly understood from Foreign Minister Hirota's recent explanations:</p>
<p>Enhancing National Power In the face of the diplomatic crisis of 1935, the only way to implement the claims of the Japanese Empire is to complete the national defense plan, enhance the national economy, and unify public opinion, which are the most urgent matters for the current government.</p>
<p>Policy Towards Manchuria Active assistance to the economic construction and open door policy of (Manchukuo) is the most effective countermeasure for 1935.</p>
<p>Policy Towards China 1935 is not only a crisis for Japanese diplomacy but also contains the danger of a rift in the Far Eastern political situation. However, Japan's diplomacy towards China cannot stubbornly adhere to a quiet observation policy. At this time, while recognizing the strict quiet observation policy towards China, it should simultaneously strive to avoid the Far Eastern crisis of 1935, stressing that this is the joint responsibility of countries located in the Far East, and persuading them to establish relations between China (and Manchukuo), thereby advancing towards alleviating the current unease in the Far East is necessary.</p>
<p>Policy Towards Britain, America, and Russia Do not play petty tricks with Britain, America, and Russia, but take as a principle to seek fundamental strategies for promoting peace between them. In particular, with regard to the United States, avoid mutually unhelpful actions, such as stimulating hostile emotions, seek close trade relations, and eliminate the anxieties of war between the two countries. With regard to Britain, fundamentally demand the restoration of reciprocal preferential treatment at the upcoming Simla Conference, and consistently strive for a compromise through mutual concessions to adjust Anglo-Japanese trade competition in the British Empire market. Urge Russia to reach a satisfactory compromise in the negotiations on the North Manchuria Railway, and take this as a starting point to resolve all outstanding issues concerning the peaceful relationship between Japan, Russia, and (Manchukuo). However, with regard to Russia's one or two actions in the world political situation, it is necessary to carefully consider whether to pursue a short-sighted pro-Russian policy.</p>
<p>South America and Other New Market Policies Strive to adjust trade relations with the old markets, while placing the focus of Japan's trade policy on acquiring new markets and increasing economic friendship with Central and South America, Africa, and the South Seas. (17th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Commemorates 9/18</h3>
<p>The Day of Their Exuberant Joy</p>
<p>The Time of Our Heartfelt Grief</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tomorrow is the second anniversary of Japan's invasion of Manchuria. Japan (and Manchukuo) are holding various commemorative events. The Tokyo Prefecture and City authorities have decided to invite 7,000 bereaved families of fallen soldiers. The Imperial Veterans Association will also hold a commemorative meeting, and the Yasukuni Shrine will hold a memorial service for the fallen soldiers. (17th Domei Dispatch) Saito Praises the Way of Kings (Tokyo) Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the Manchurian Incident. Prime Minister Saito's statement is as follows: The foundation of (Manchukuo)'s nation-building has been gradually consolidated. The thirty million people are diligently engaged in their work under the way of kings politics, which is truly cause for celebration. Our entire nation will henceforth further promote the coexistence and co-prosperity of Japan (and Manchukuo), expecting the establishment of peace in the Far East, so as to contribute to the welfare of the world's humanity. (17th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hirota's Deceptive Remarks Foreign Minister Hirota said, all criticism must undergo a certain period. The Liutiao Lake Incident erupted on September 18th two years ago, leading to the independence of (Manchukuo) and Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Two years have now passed. Japan and other countries are considering the Manchurian problem with a calm attitude. If the people of the world could have maintained the same calm attitude two years ago as they do today, the world would not have had to go through unnecessary detours. Maintaining the status quo is the highest justice among nations, which is a formalistic argument. The independence of (Manchukuo), originating from the self-defense instinct of Manchurian society, has received the fundamental assistance of Japan, which upholds the principle of maintaining peace in the Far East. This is a self-reliance movement for the overall situation in East Asia. Therefore, if viewed with a calm eye, it can be seen that there is no reason for China and Japan to contend over (Manchukuo). (Manchukuo) is raising the banner of the Way of Kings, engaging in various constructions. Its emergence is by no means a ditch between China and Japan, but rather a bridge that makes the relations between the two countries even closer. (18th Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>Araki's Superstition in Military Force (Tokyo) Minister of the Army Araki's statement is as follows: Two years have passed since the Manchurian Incident occurred. I believe these two years are most significant for Japan (and Manchukuo). The two countries are now closely linked, carrying out the mission of peace in the Far East. Although military operations within Manchukuo have come to an end, much effort is still needed to ensure complete security. Japan also has the obligation to defend against foreign enemies, so we should have the awareness to overcome any difficulties. However, this awareness of ours is by no means exclusive, but rather a spirit of building ourselves. (17th Domei Dispatch)</p>

(16th Havas Dispatch) Political Detective Leaks News Soviet Russia Excavates Imperial Tombs</p>
<p>Gold, Silver, and Treasures Sold to Relieve Famine The Entire History is Clearly Revealed</p>
<p>Reuters London Dispatch A Polish newspaper recently published a shocking story about a Soviet committee plundering the imperial tombs in Petrograd, which was sent by a member of the Soviet political police to his friend in Warsaw. If the story is true, it has great historical significance. The letter said, I am writing about an unforgettable impression… The heavy doors of the imperial tombs have been opened. Before our eyes are the tombs of the emperors, arranged in a semi-circle. The entire history of Russia is here. The chairman then ordered, (First open the most recent one.)</p>
<p>Alexander III in Full Military Regalia</p>
<p>So the engineers took axes and opened the tomb of Alexander III. The imperial clothes were a general's uniform, decorated with great splendor. His body was taken out of the silver coffin, and the ring on his finger and the diamond decorations on his coat were removed. After that, the body was placed in a small coffin made of teak. Then, the tombs of Alexander II and Nicholas I were opened in succession. The members of the committee worked quickly because the air in the tombs was very stuffy.</p>
<p>Alexander I Proved to be a Monk</p>
<p>Next was the tomb of Alexander I. But to everyone's surprise, the tomb was empty. It was rumored that the emperor died in Taganrog and was later buried in Petrograd, but this was all false. It has now been verified that the emperor became a monk in Siberia and ended his days there.</p>
<p>Paul's Corpse Still Frightening</p>
<p>Next, Paul's coffin was opened. Everyone was horrified. Although the uniform he wore was dazzling, his head was not intact. The wax mask had deteriorated due to the long passage of time and changes in the climate, revealing horrifying scars on his face. It turns out that the emperor was assassinated. The bodies were all hastily placed in small teak coffins. The original silver coffins were stacked aside by the workers. The committee spent a lot of time in the tomb of Catherine the Great, because many gems were found in the coffin.</p>
<p>Peter the Great's Face Lifelike</p>
<p>Finally, the tomb of Peter the Great was opened. For convenience, the silver coffin was placed upright. As soon as the coffin lid was opened, a majestic and heroic figure was clearly visible. Everyone took a few steps back. Looking at his face, it was as if he were still alive. When Peter the Great was alive, the people feared him like a demon king. Even today, we are still terrified. But after his body was placed in a teak coffin, the remains, which had been preserved for two hundred years, will also turn to dust. After the work was completed, the small coffins were all sent to the St. Isaac's Cathedral and stored in the basement. The excavation of the tombs was ordered by the Famine Relief Association, in order to melt the silver coffins and sell the treasures obtained.</p>

<h3>East Road Negotiations Stalled Hirota Warns Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Says If Russia's Attitude Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The Breakdown of Negotiations Will Be Russia's Responsibility (Tokyo) Negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway stalled after the intermediate consultations on the 23rd of last month. New Foreign Minister Hirota is quite worried about this and recently warned the Soviet Union with the following attitude: (1) The Soviet Union's adherence to technical issues has caused the negotiations to stall, and even the Japanese government, which is acting as a mediator, regrets this. (2) The Soviet Union's failure to express a clear intention on the conversion rate for the (Manchukuo) proposal raises doubts about its sincerity. Currently, Japan hopes that the Soviet Union will not adhere to technical issues and consider a political solution. (3) If the Soviet Union continues to maintain its current attitude, the transfer negotiations may even break down. At that time, the Soviet Union will naturally be responsible for all the situations that arise as a result. (17th Dentsu Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Cuban Interim President Convenes Revolutionary Leaders' Meeting</h3>
<p>Whether the Situation Can Stabilize Depends on This One Move; Five Hundred Dismissed Military Officers Are Surrounded, Supplies Cut Off; U.S. Ambassador Declares Unwillingness to Intervene Unless Absolutely Necessary</p>
<p>Havana – The Cuban interim government has begun negotiations with the leaders of the four major revolutionary factions opposing the current government. According to tonight's situation, the country's order and peace will depend on the outcome of this meeting. The four faction leaders are: one, former President Menocal, who formed a revolutionary group and launched an uprising in 1931, fighting against the Machado government forces without success; two, Colonel Mendieta, who was Menocal's deputy during the 1931 uprising and was desired by many to be president this time; three, A.B.C. group leader Saenz, whose group used terrorist acts to counter Machado's terror politics and assassinate Machado's secret agents, and is a very powerful revolutionary group; four, former Havana Mayor Gomez, the leader of another revolutionary faction. It is reported that before meeting with interim President Grau San Martin, the leaders demanded that the current government be reorganized so that each faction would have one or two representatives to ensure fair elections and elect a formal president acceptable to all factions. The interim president refused. The leaders then declared that if this was the case, the factions could not support the current government. Grau San Martin then cited the failure of yesterday's revolutionary uprising in Pinar del Río province as clear proof that the current government can control the situation and that the military unanimously supports it, as according to today's news, the unrest in Pinar del Río has been temporarily quelled. The opposition leaders then replied that the military is not necessarily united behind the current government. The meaning of this statement can be seen as the factions supporting Saenz and Mendieta are preparing to support a new movement. However, it is reported that the opposition finally agreed to temporarily suspend this proposal and listen to the government's views, but as of tonight, the meeting between the two sides has not yet reached a resolution. At this time, it seems that the students have clearly divided into two factions, one supporting the current government and the other still supporting Saenz's policies. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Havana – Cuban commerce has completely stalled. American merchants will not allow any transactions without cash payment first. At the same time, the situation is even more serious due to the general strike last week to overthrow the San Martin government. Although the deadline of the ultimatum to the five hundred Cuban officers in the National Hotel to surrender within thirty-six hours has passed, no military action has been taken against these officers. Today, the supplies to these officers have been cut off, and a second ultimatum has been issued, demanding surrender by Sunday. The new government plans to deport one hundred Cuban officers and order three hundred officers who resigned when Batista was commander-in-chief to return to their original positions. After Wells spoke with the Student Guidance Committee today, according to a member of the committee, the US Ambassador declared that if the lives and property of American citizens are endangered, the US Navy will land, but the United States will not interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. The Washington government believes deeply that there will be an emergency change in Cuba within 24 hours, which will demonstrate whether the San Martin government has the ability to restore order.

<h3>Hurricane Wreaks Havoc on the U.S. Atlantic Coast</h3>

However, the most severely affected area seems to be New Bern, North Carolina, where high tides reached the shore, and warehouses, city buildings, and villages suffered losses of no less than $500,000. Many power lines along the way were blown down, crops suffered greatly, and many rivers overflowed. Tonight, it is reported that it has blown to Canada. The total loss from the hurricane in three days exceeds two million dollars.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of the World Economic Conference Has Not Completely Dissipated</h3>
<p>MacDonald Feigns Interest and Attempts to Reconvene</p>
<p>(London) – The spirit of the World Economic Conference after its death seems not to have completely dissipated. According to news released here today, the director of the League of Nations' Economic and Financial Sections has returned to England today at the invitation of British Prime Minister MacDonald to discuss whether there is any hope of reviving the Economic Conference. However, according to calm observers, there is no sign of much brightness in the future. Perhaps MacDonald wants to reconvene the conference soon, but this is probably just because MacDonald was entrusted with this responsibility when the conference closed last July and cannot but feign interest.

<h3>A Great War in Asia Within Ten Years</h3>
<p>丨 Prediction by English Scholar H.G. Wells 丨</p>
<p>1935: Japan Sends a Large Army to Invade North China Again, Creating a Puppet State</p>
<p>1936: Japan Mobilizes Two Million Troops to Invade All Parts of China</p>
<p>1937: Russian Air Force Attacks Japan, Japan and U.S. Navy Engage in Great Battle</p>
<p>1938: Japanese Army Retreats from China, Great Revolution Breaks Out at Home</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence, according to a report in the "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun," the English scholar H.G. Wells predicted major changes in the world over the next hundred years. Among them, regarding the Far East situation within ten years, the predictions are as follows:</p>
<p>1935: Japan will occupy Tianjin and Peiping and create another puppet state. Japan will control all military and political power, just like the puppet state of Manchukuo. This move by Japan will further destabilize the overall situation in China, and internal unrest in Manchuria, Mongolia, and mainland China will worsen. The communist army will increase its power throughout China, and the four hundred-odd states in China will be in chaos.</p>
<p>1936: In order to completely eliminate anti-Japanese boycotts throughout China, Japan will mobilize a large army of two million troops and invade Shandong, Nanjing, and Guangdong with great ferocity. At the beginning of the campaign, the war will go smoothly, and the Japanese army will be arrogant and high-spirited.</p>
<p>1937: The Japanese army will suffer an irreversible blow. The Soviet Russian Red Air Force, which is seeking opportunities to move in the Far East and mainland China, will launch a surprise attack on Osaka and Tokyo, Japan, and drop poisonous gas bombs and incendiary bombs, turning Japan into scorched earth. Moreover, the victory or defeat of the Japanese army in China will not be determined on the battlefield, but in the field hospitals.</p>
<p>1938: Each division and brigade of the invading Japanese army will be infected with blackwater fever. Brave Japanese soldiers will fall one after another due to the epidemic, eventually leading to great panic. They will retreat one after another. During their retreat, they will be ambushed and pursued by the Chinese army, and most of them will be buried in China. Survivors will retreat in defeat to Japan.</p>
<p>As for U.S.-Japan relations, the United States will preemptively sign a mutual defense alliance with Australia, New Zealand, etc., under the pretext of protecting the civilized Pacific islands, to deal with Japan. The great naval battle between the U.S. and Japan will not follow the usual rules of international law. Before the declaration of war, each main battle fleet will have arrived at the predetermined battlefield. They will fight first and then declare war. The decisive battle for the Philippine Islands will begin in 1937. The great naval battle can be described as fierce and unparalleled. After two days and nights of continuous fighting, neither side will win or lose. Each side will collect the remaining ships and retreat to its base. The losses on both sides will be incalculable. Although it is difficult to determine who is the victor, since Japan cannot prevent the U.S. army and navy from landing on the islands, it should be considered a defeat for Japan. Matters have come to this point. The Japanese people, who were initially complacent about the successful operations, will also become increasingly indifferent to the military's warmongering policies due to this defeat, and morale will be depressed. According to the biggest reason for Japan's defeat is the strange arm of Red Russia, which is working both inside and outside the country. The United States will take the opportunity to organize an economic blockade against Japan. Japan will suffer an unprecedented economic panic. By 1938, a great revolution will break out in Japan, leading to an irrecoverable state of chaos. The Japanese revolution will eventually induce a great revolution throughout Asia, spreading through India and Persia, and reaching Europe in 1940. (China United News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan Arrests Red Lawyer Group</h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo "Hochi Shimbun" of the 14th, the Special Higher Police Section of the Metropolitan Police Department discovered that the Red Lawyer Group took advantage of the opening of the trial of the Communist Party incident of Sano Gaku et al. in the summer of 1931 to organize the Japanese Red Relief Lawyers Association and obtained the recognition of the Third International to use the outer periphery movement of the Communist Party as its goal. Afterwards, the lawyers among the members provided intellectual and labor power and other Red elements, using their profession to strive to contact Party members in prison with the outside world and to struggle for judgment and expand and strengthen the Party. The Party's senior members attended all secret consultations on the methods of the judgment struggle. This matter was known to the Metropolitan Police Department. First, the relief director Kakuda Morihei, Matsuoka Matsudaira, Tanimura Michio, etc. were impeached, and at the same time, they tried their best to investigate its content to clarify the main reason for the expansion and strengthening of the Party movement. It has now been discovered that the important members of the Red Lawyer Group, Fuse Tatsuji, Kamimura Susumu, Shindo Kanji, Kawai Atsushi, Omori Akio, Kubota Teizaburo, Nashiki Sakujiro, Makino Mitsuyasu, Nakamura Koichi, Ikeda Enshi, Tsuchiya Hideo, Miura Jiro, Onuki Kiyoshi, Muto Unjuro, Yomogita Takeshi, and seventeen others, secretly plotted nefarious actions. That is, their Labor-Farmer Defense Lawyers Group merged the All-Farmers National Conference sent Lawyer Group and the Japan Victims Relief Group in February of this year, calling it the Japan Labor-Farmer Lawyers Group, forming a radical legal group in the opposition. Lawyer Kakuda Morio exerted his skills even more vigorously, carrying out various illegal movements. Since the impeachment of the Communist Party in October last year, he has used the special status of lawyers to have legality to arbitrarily carry out activities, concealing the strict vigilance of the prison authorities in the public trial struggle and the contact between the defendants in prison and the outside Party members. The Metropolitan Police Department, in order to maintain public order, suddenly arrested all twenty lawyers, including Kakuda, Matsuoka, and Tanimura, etc. on the morning of the 13th. Five other lawyers, such as Aoki Lawyer, etc., are actively searching because their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>Zhongdian, Yunnan Falls</h3>
<p>Tibetan Barbarians Invade Zhongdian City</p>
<p>Lijiang County Telegram Alerts Province</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence, Yunnan is located on the extreme border, surrounded by powerful neighbors. It borders French Vietnam to the south, British Burma to the west, and the Kang Tibetan region to the north. Counties such as Zhongdian, Weixi, and Lijiang, being on the border, have often been ravaged by border barbarians and Tibetan bandits in the past. The nature of the border barbarians and Tibetan bandits is fierce, and they are skilled in equestrian archery, which has long been a problem in the border area. Just when there was nothing to be done, news came from Lijiang saying that Zhongdian County was suddenly attacked by four to five thousand Tibetan barbarians in late last month, who occupied Zhongdian County. Because Tibet is their background, their power is very great. Since Zhongdian is the gateway to Yunnan Province, if Zhongdian is lost, Lijiang will be difficult to protect. This is extremely important to national defense. According to the Lijiang Provincial Association, a telegram from Lijiang stated, "(Tibetan bandit gangsters (that is, barbarian bandits from Xiangcheng in Sichuan and Kang) of more than four thousand, attack Dian City every day, the city has been captured, urgently need bullets, please collect and distribute quickly, Lijiang County Magistrate He Wenxuan kowtows), it can be seen that Zhongdian has fallen.

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Arrives in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Settles Old Troops, Arranges Officials and Families</p>
<p>Prepares Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping, General Ma Zhanshan arrived in Tanggu on the 10th night from Shanghai on the "Shuntian" wheel on the 8th of this month and changed trains to Tianjin. He stayed at Wan Fulin's residence in Tianjin. After hearing the news, Wan immediately sent his son, Wan Guobin, to lead personnel from Peiping to welcome him. Because Ma's purpose of going to Beiping was to settle the old troops in Chahar and the families of officials and soldiers in Peiping, and it was necessary to meet with He Yingqin, he took the three cars sent by Wan's residence with Wan Guobin and his entourage from Wan's residence at about 9:00 am on the 14th and traveled to Peiping. Wan also notified in advance the 106th Division Shen Ke's troops of the Thirty-second Army stationed in the Tongzhou area to protect them along the way. At 1:30 pm, Ma and his party arrived in Peiping and went directly to Wan's residence to stay. In order to avoid the trouble of entertaining from all sides, Ma was extremely secretive in advance. After Ma arrived in Peiping, many important figures from Heilongjiang Province in Peiping visited Wan's residence that afternoon. Wan Fulin accompanied Ma to Jurentang to visit He and discuss the settlement of his old troops and the arrangement of officials in Peiping. On the morning of the 15th, Ma met with reporters from various newspapers in the east parlor of Wan's residence and made the following remarks. The reporter asked, "What is General Ma's mission in coming to the north?" Ma replied, "I arrived in Tianjin by boat from Shanghai on the 10th. Before leaving, in order to avoid farewells from all sides, I only telegraphed the National Government to report my trip north. I did not notify other parties, so very few people outside know about it. Since returning from the anti-Japanese war, part of my old troops are in Xinjiang, about 2,000 people, which have been reorganized by Sheng Shicai, and part are in Chahar, numbering 6,000, led by Tan Zixin, which have been completely returned to the Central Government for reorganization. After I arrived in Peiping, I have telegraphed Tan, and Tan can probably come to Peiping. Before I arrived in Peiping, I sent someone with funds to Chahar to comfort the old troops and inspect the military situation nearby. There are about two ends to my mission in coming to Peiping: (1) plan to settle the families of old troops in Peiping; (2) prepare to hold a memorial service for the anti-Japanese war dead of the troops since September 18th. When will the meeting be held? It has not yet been decided." (Asked) General Ma's future actions and work? (Answered) After I arrived in Peiping, it coincided with a small twist in the change of the director of the Peiping Municipal Public Security Bureau. If I stay in Peiping permanently, I am afraid it will cause other rumors. Therefore, I decided to meet with Acting Chairman He and friends in Peiping once and then return to Tianjin. Regarding work, because the troops under my command have been returned to the state after returning home, and I personally still have a stomach illness, I can take this opportunity to rest. If the state needs to use me in the future, I should still try to make things difficult." (Asked) What are General Ma's thoughts on returning from the anti-Japanese war? (Answered) I led the team in Heilongjiang to fight against Japan with limited troops against an army with plans and organization. Victory or defeat was already in mind. What will happen in the future is that the country has a whole plan and proceeds according to it. It is not convenient for me to express my opinion. I only hope that the responsible persons in the country will unite and work together to secure the country internally and resist foreign aggression. When I arrived in Shanghai, the National Government</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>appointed me as a member of the Military Affairs Committee, and although I resigned, I was not approved. (Asked) The truth about the dispute over national salvation donations? (Answered) With General Zhu's personal qualifications, no one would believe that there are malpractices in the donation for national salvation, let alone that the donation would be used for anything. However, General Zhu has always been charitable, and there have been those who have sought assistance from General Zhu for official matters, or who have allocated a portion of it for relief from this fund. Although General Zhu did not distribute its use according to the designation of the donors, it was all used in accordance with the psychology of the donors. It cannot be said that General Zhu has lost credibility in money. General Zhu will be able to announce the expenditure account of the national salvation donation soon. However, the donation side cannot be announced at the same time because it is mostly inconvenient to announce. (Asked) Has there been any telegram exchange between General Ma and Mr. Zhang Hanqing (Xueliang) recently? (Answered) When I was in Italy, Deputy Commander Zhang (Xueliang) was about to go to England. I met him once in a hurry. After returning to China, there were one or two telegram exchanges. Recently, Deputy Commander Zhang has not sent any telegrams. (Asked) Are Su Bingwen and Wang Delin coming north? (Answered) After General Su returned to China, he is now living at home in Suzhou. When I left Shanghai, Su was in Suzhou and I did not meet him. I don't know if he is coming north. Wang Delin is in Guangdong and has not sent any telegrams recently. (Asked) Has General Ma's office in Shanghai been closed? (Answered) The office in Shanghai is currently being prepared to be closed. However, the work of sorting out the list of anti-Japanese war dead is still in progress in order to be reported to the Central Government. The office can be closed in the shortest time. At this point, the reporters said goodbye. (Evening of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Dongping River Dyke Breaches</h3>
<p>Three Thousand Qing of Lakeside Fields Flooded</p>
<p>County Magistrate Zhang Jumps into River, Rescued</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, The Yellow River banks in the areas of Shouzhang, Dongping, and Dong'e are surrounded by mountains, preventing water from flowing out, so there are no official embankments. Only residents near the water build civil levees to defend against the water in order to cultivate. A few days ago, the Yellow River breached at Erfenzhuang, and the water flowed from Shouzhang into Dongping. The people of Dongping built a dike to defend against the water and protect the lakeside fields (Dongping Lake). The people of Shouzhang believed that Dongping's dike would prevent water from entering the lake, causing Shouzhang to be flooded. They led more than a hundred people to dig up the dike. The people of Dongping resisted, and there was a melee. Although one person was injured in Dongping, the dike was not dug open in the end. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 14th, the dike suddenly breached. County Magistrate Zhang Zhixi went to rescue it without success. Because the efforts of building the dike were all in vain, three thousand Qing of lakeside fields within the dike, worth 1.5 million yuan in agricultural products, were all submerged in the ocean. He then jumped into the river in anger. After ten minutes, he was rescued, fortunately, he did not die. The first section chief of the county government and Zhang himself both sent telegrams to Ji'nan to report. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) To Director Zhang Jun, the report on the dike construction in this county to block water has been telegraphed. Today, for some unknown reason, the firm place suddenly breached. County Magistrate Zhang Zhixi went to rescue it without success. Seeing the disaster, he cried bitterly and jumped into the breach to martyr himself. Fortunately, he was rescued by sailors after ten minutes. His body is still recuperating. Details will be reported later. Liu Yangtian, the first section chief of the Dongping County Government, bows and deletes at noon. (2) To Director Zhang Jun of the Construction Department, the Yellow River water from the former Shouzhang flowed into my territory. I supervised the emergency work without rest, and rushed to build a new dike of thirty li, protecting three thousand Qing of fields, estimated at 1.5 million yuan. Afterwards, I returned to the city to handle disaster relief. Unfortunately, the new dike breached on a cold night. I rushed to rescue it at night without success. I grieve over the hard work of the people and my own hard work and thoughts, which were all in vain. The heavens do not bless us and only make our people suffer. I could not control myself and sought death. I was rescued and my body is unharmed. I plan to build a dike thirty li away from the water to protect one corner. In addition to a detailed report, I specifically send this telegram. Zhang Zhixi, County Magistrate of Dongping, bows and deletes. (16th)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Jining Disaster Victims Arrive in Jinan to Petition for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>丨Shandong Construction Department Plans Work Relief丨</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Jining County, located in western Shandong and afflicted by floods, sent representatives Zhang Jingyun, Wang Junshan, and Xie Guangxin today (the 15th) to Jinan to present the disaster situation and petition for disaster relief. At noon, they met with Zhang Honglie, the director of the Construction Department, requesting him to relay their plea to the Chairman of the Provincial Government for swift and urgent relief to save lives. Because Jining is located downstream of various rivers and is the lowest-lying area in western Shandong, the Yellow River overflowed this time, causing severe disasters in various counties. The suffering is beyond words. The representatives also submitted a detailed report on the disaster to the Construction Department. Zhang Honglie agreed to forward it to the Chairman. The submitted document reads as follows: (Jining is located downstream of various rivers and is the lowest-lying area in western Shandong. In recent years, disasters have occurred repeatedly, and farmers have reached the point of extreme poverty. This year's wheat harvest was slightly better, but it was not enough to make up for past losses. They only hoped for a good autumn harvest to avoid starvation. Unexpectedly, in early August, continuous heavy rain caused the rivers to overflow, and the Yellow River flooded like a waterfall. As a result, people in the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts gathered on the riverbanks, living in the open and battling the floods day and night. Within a month, the cost of the necessary stakes and materials amounted to tens of thousands of yuan. Fortunately, the breaches were repaired as soon as they occurred, and the flood did not spread further. However, on the 27th of the month, the Yellow River breached its banks, impacting Jining, and surged from the Juye and Jiaxiang areas. It rushed straight through the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, causing breaches in the Zhu and Zhao Rivers on the north and south sides, which flowed into each other. Seventy miles in length and breadth became a swamp, and 400 villages became lakes. Fields, crops, and houses were all submerged, and livestock and property were lost to the water. The strong could climb trees and call for help, but most of the elderly and children stayed in their homes to die. The suffering is beyond description. Now that the relevant authorities have sent personnel to investigate and confirm the situation, we await the announcement of relief. However, the lives of the people hang by a thread, and they are waiting to be fed. With a glimmer of hope, we look forward to rescue. I believe that Director Zhang has a compassionate heart and considers the hunger and drowning of others as his own. In addition to submitting this report externally, we dare to appeal for the allocation of disaster relief funds urgently, so that they can be distributed as soon as possible. Not only will the disaster victims be grateful for your kindness, but the village chiefs will also be grateful for your act of re-creation. Respectfully submitted to Zhang, the Director of the Construction Department of the Shandong Provincial Government.) Due to the severity of this flood and the difficulty of providing relief, the Construction Department is planning to use work relief. It plans to first repair and dredge the Zhao Wang River in Jining County, then the Zhu River, and then repair the Yanzhou-Caozhou highway to provide widespread relief. After the plan is formulated, it will be submitted to the inaugural meeting of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee to be held in Kaifeng on the 25th of this month for discussion. Zhou Xiangxian, the Director of Work Relief at the Yellow River Flood Conference, and Xi Dejiong, the Director of Disaster Relief, are also paying close attention to this matter. Zhang Honglie and Zhang Lianjia are both expected to attend the inaugural meeting of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee. If Zhang Honglie is unable to attend due to official business, Zhang Lianjia will attend to bring the plan to the meeting (15th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Unrequited Love Leads to Mutual Suicide</h3>
<p>Yu Caixi, a patrol officer from the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, originally from Henan, came to Songjiang before the Xinhai Revolution. After the revolution, he served as a platoon leader in the National Army and in the police force. He has been in Songjiang for over twenty years. He used to have an affair with Zhu, the wife of Bao Ada, and they lived together. Zhu had a daughter, nicknamed Lao Er, who was quite attractive. After she came of age, she fell in love with Song, a company commander in a certain army, and they lived together. They have a son and a daughter. Yu Caixi has been unemployed for a long time, spending his days gambling. Zhu, his mistress, has aged and faded. He wanted to make advances towards Lao Er, but was rejected. He separated from Zhu, who depended on Lao Er for support. Yu Caixi was alone. Just last year, he got his current job through an introduction. He knew that Lao Er's lover, Song, had not returned and there was no news. Lao Er, though approaching thirty, was still attractive, and he heard that she had a new relationship. Yu Caixi wanted to fulfill his long-cherished desire. He secretly visited her home on the night of the 15th, but was firmly rejected. He saw a man's rain shoes under the bed and left in resentment. Yesterday evening (the 16th) at 7:30, he went there again with his gun after finishing his duties. Lao Er suddenly saw him coming and knew that he had bad intentions. Suddenly, a bullet came flying and hit her left breast. Her fingers on her right hand, which she had used to press against her left breast, were also injured by the gunshot. Yu, seeing the disaster he had caused, also wanted to die. He pointed the gun at his chest and pulled the trigger to commit suicide. The tragic case of unrequited love leading to mutual suicide occurred. Lao Er's mother, Zhu, cried bitterly and fainted. The remaining pistol bullets were recovered by the Public Security Bureau. Today, prosecutor Zhu Zonghai led officials to examine the scene and instructed the family to collect the bodies. Lao Er's children are all young and pitiful to those who see them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Kunshan County Magistrate Accused</h3>
<p>Wang Fenghui, a citizen of Kunshan County, accused Cheng Ruji, the magistrate of Kunshan County, of protecting merchants and abusing his power in violation of the law. He specifically submitted a report to the Third District Administrative Inspector's Office, requesting a fair and thorough investigation to clean up officialdom. After receiving the report, Inspector Zou yesterday (the 17th) instructed the original reporter that it had been forwarded to the Department of Civil Affairs for review.</p>
<p>Commemorating the September 18th Incident with Expanded Propaganda</p>

<p>Mastermind of Conspiracy to Kill Paramour Apprehended</p>
<p>Qin Tianfu of Dazhu Village, Xishan Township, Dongting, colluded with Liu to stab his wife Qin Wu's lover to death. Qin Tianfu surrendered to the District Procuratorate and was taken into custody after interrogation. Qin Wu, the mastermind of the case, was arrested by the 14th Branch of the Public Security Bureau and escorted to Suzhou on the 16th. After interrogation at the District Procuratorate, she was immediately detained. The District Procuratorate also issued an arrest warrant for the second accomplice, Liu, to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Doctor Kidnapped Mid-Call</h3>
<p>Zhu Yunting, a well-known doctor in Qianwang, Second District (Jingyun City), is over sixty years old. Three or four years ago, he set up a clinic at Beizhakou and had a comfortable life. On the 15th of this month, a farmer surnamed Xia from Xuanhua'an near Liutan Bridge in the Sixth District, who was seriously ill, invited Dr. Zhu to treat him. After the treatment was completed, it was already evening. The Xia family hired a boat to take him back to the city. At the same time, the Xia's wife (the patient's wife) also came to the city to buy medicine. At about 9:00 PM, the boat was sailing to the back of Lihua Village, near Tangnan Bridge, north of the high and long bank. The river surface was wide and there was no one around. As they were proceeding, a bandit boat suddenly came head-on, and several bandits jumped out, firing shots to demonstrate and shouting to stop. They searched the boat but found nothing. The bandits were furious and tied up Dr. Zhu and the farmer's wife and sped away. Yesterday morning, the Xia's wife was released from the bandits' den and sent to Tangbei Bridge, where she safely returned home. However, there is no news of Zhu Yunting, and his whereabouts are unknown. According to the farmer's wife, Zhu is still on the boat, and the bandits will send a letter to the Zhu family demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Telegram Requesting Suspension of Perpetual Tenancy Contract Tax</h3>
<p>Gu Zhutong, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently initiated the implementation of the Perpetual Tenancy Contract Tax, which was submitted to and approved by the 594th Provincial Government Meeting. The main points of the collection regulations are as follows: 1. For any land with tenancy rights on cultivated land or grazing land, a tax of five silver dollars per mu will be levied for the transfer and signing of the contract, which will be paid by the perpetual tenant. 2. For land with perpetual tenancy characteristics after the implementation of these regulations, if no contract has been signed or the contract has been lost, a contract should be established and taxes paid within three months from the date of promulgation of these regulations. 3. Those who exceed the three-month deadline will be fined one time the tax amount; those who exceed six months, two times the tax amount; and those who exceed one year, three times the tax amount. 4. If the perpetual tenant violates the regulations and delays in paying taxes, anyone may report it to the county government. If the report is verified, 30% of the fines will be awarded to the informant. After hearing the news, the local county party headquarters telegraphed the provincial party headquarters yesterday to forward the request to the central government for strict prohibition. The original text roughly stated that in recent years, droughts and floods have been frequent, and agricultural production has been poor. The income of tenant farmers is insufficient even to pay land rent. It is strange that the Jiangsu Provincial Government issued this harsh tax targeting tenant farmers at this time. The previous proposal to continue collecting an additional two yuan per shi of grain tax is said to have been canceled, but now it has intensified, scraping the remaining blood and sweat of tenant farmers. Its calculation is cunning. Moreover, the law does not apply retroactively, but now those who have not signed a contract or whose contract has been lost must establish a contract and pay taxes retroactively. The search is meticulous and thorough. However, the central government has previously issued an order that the establishment of donations and taxes must be approved by the Central Political Conference. Now, this regulation is only promulgated and implemented by the Provincial Government Committee, which is disrespectful to the central government and completely absurd. This action is enough to provoke resentment among farmers and create propaganda material for reactionary factions. We dare to request that it be forwarded to the central government for strict prohibition to preserve a lifeline for farmers.</p>
<h3>Victims of Economic Oppression in Taicang</h3>
<p>Zhou Rensan, a tenant farmer from Houxing Township, Eighth District of the county, cultivates more than 20 mu of rented land. Recently, because the rice was ripe, he contracted the harvesting to Cao Deqing, a local, for five silver dollars. After Cao took half of the ripe rice, he stopped working due to other matters. Zhou demanded the return of the remaining money from Cao Deqing, but was unsuccessful. He tied Cao up for a night, and he was only released after mediation. Cao, filled with shame and resentment, secretly drowned himself in the river. Yesterday, his body was discovered. The family reported to the county for verification. Also, Chen, the wife of Hu Dinggong, a resident of Lujia Bridge East, Shuangfeng Town in the same district, suffered greatly from economic oppression because her husband's monthly income was meager and insufficient to cover the expenses of the whole family. She secretly went to the Xie Xing Company to buy opium for 1,000 cash and swallowed it. She died of poisoning immediately. It is also a tragic event.</p>
<h3>Nantong Chuan Gang Cracks Down on Red Pill Manufacturing Ring</h3>
<p>In Nantong Chuan Gang Town, the Tenth District Office cracked down on a large-scale red pill manufacturing ring in the residence of a Mr. Yin in the southeast township. A large number of red pills, manufacturing equipment, and medicinal materials were seized. The employees, including Shi Xiangming, were arrested and sent to the county government. According to their confession, the ring was established by Xi Guangjun, a well-known opium dealer in Jiangbei, who has now fled.</p>
<h3>Tax Police Suppress Smugglers</h3>
<p>Recently, large groups of salt smugglers have gathered in Lingdian, Daan, and other ports along the river in Nantong and Haimen counties. Private salt merchants are flocking there, resulting in the market being flooded with smuggled salt. Xu Yonghua, the district chief of the Fourth District of the Tax Police, has dispatched a large team to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Male Corpse Found Murdered</h3>
<p>A male corpse was found in the Xue Luolan River in the county. He was about forty years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers, barefoot, with a straw bag over his head, tied tightly, and grass rope tied on his feet. It was clear that he had been murdered and his body thrown into the river. The local village police have salvaged the body and reported it to the Public Security Bureau for inspection.</p>
<h3>Xinfeng Town Silk Filatures Robbed</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Town in the south of the county is the only major town in Jiashan County. The autumn silkworm cocoons are about to be listed on the market. The town has four or five silk filatures that are fully operational, buying autumn cocoons, and the quantity purchased is not small. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning (the 16th), more than a hundred bandits suddenly arrived, cutting all the power lines and surrounding the Public Security Bureau and the security group, so that all the police officers and security guards were threatened and unable to resist. The bandits then went to rob the silk filatures in different groups. After several hours, they left triumphantly. The loss amounted to approximately 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Woman Robbed Returning from Collecting Debt</h3>
<p>Robberies of ships on waterways are almost monthly occurrences, especially on the waterway from Gaoyou to Yangzhou. Yesterday (the 15th), Qiu Wanyou, a nephew of Zhou, from Tang Zhuang outside the South Gate, returned to her mother's home in Ningyi to collect debts. Carrying 256 yuan, she took a rowboat back to Yangzhou. When she reached the place half a li from Qishu Pavilion, Shaobo, she was robbed by three men who were rowing the boat. They took out pistols and ordered her to hand over the money. The woman handed over everything she had. The bandits then ordered the boatman to pull the boat ashore, jumped ashore, fired shots as a demonstration, and left.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Jiang Yuqing Sentenced for Abducting Female Worker</h3>
<p>Mao Yuying, a woman from Yixing County, used to work in Shanghai with her parents. She was seduced by Jiang Yuqing, a neighbor, and they had an affair. Fearing exposure, they fled to Zhenjiang together and lived together in Shuilu Temple Lane. They had a quarrel and were discovered by the police, who took them to the Second Branch. After questioning by Director Zhao, it was suspected that they had committed adultery and abduction. They were transferred to the court. After investigation, the facts were confirmed. The family members of the woman were notified to come to Zhenjiang to take Mao Yuying back. Jiang was sent to the criminal court for interrogation and sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Ouyang held a court session and interrogated them for a long time. He immediately passed judgment, sentencing Jiang Yuqing to one year of imprisonment for enticing a woman under the age of twenty to leave the parental home.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: More Corpses Found in Arm Case</h3>
<p>In the Yuehua Barber Shop at No. 77 Guantongqiao Zhijie, Hangzhou, a corpse arm was discovered during the installation of water pipes (see separate article). Afterwards, the police station in charge found more than ten pieces of small bones. In No. 78, they found a secret room where the landlord, Ye Jinbiao, stacked debris, and there was a fishy smell. The police station hired workers to completely pry up all the floorboards. They found twenty-eight more small bones, the shortest being two or three inches and the longest being four or five inches, totaling fifty-two. All were sent to the court for testing.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen Returned to Nanjing Separately Last Night</h3>
<p>Song Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning Aboard Customs Patrol Ship</p>
<p>Wang Boarded Train at Zhenru Station in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Huang Fu Visited Wang to Continue Discussing North China Affairs</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the president of the Executive Yuan, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday with Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, to visit Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Huang Fu to discuss important matters.

<h3>Wang Returns to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, took advantage of the leisure of last Saturday to come to Shanghai from Nanjing with Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and others, to visit Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, to conduct further thorough discussions on the expansion of the National Economic Commission, the detailed items of the distribution of American cotton and wheat, and other important issues. At the same time, he asked Huang Fu, the Chairman of the Beiping Political Council, to return north soon. Wang, having completed his official business in Shanghai, left Shanghai at 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon with Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways, by train from Zhenru Railway Station to return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Song Travels by Ship</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen left with his wife and others at 10:40 AM yesterday. Then, at around 11:00 AM, he took a small tugboat called "Jinghui" from the Bund Jianghai Customs Wharf and crossed to the Yangshupu Tilanqiao waterfront. He switched to the Customs "Meteor" patrol ship, which was moored there, and left Shanghai to enter Nanjing. The departure was very secret. Few people outside knew about it. Only Yang Hu, the Director of the Municipal Security Office, Hu Junzhuang of the banking industry, Yang Zhixiong of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Song Ziliang, Song Ziwen's younger brother, went to the Jianghai Customs Wharf to see him off. It is reported that Song may arrive in Nanjing at around 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM this morning. Those who took the "Meteor" patrol ship to Nanjing with Song yesterday included Song's wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, Song's daughter, Song's younger brother, Song Zian, and six or seven guards and servants.

<h3>Sun Ke Discusses Future Work of National Economic Commission</h3>
<p>Focusing on Improving Domestic Rice, Wheat, and Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Reviving Rural Economy and Jiangxi Bandit Area</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and spoke in detail about the goals of the National Economic Commission's future work. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Economic Organization, Cotton and Wheat Distribution</h3>
<p>According to Sun, the organization charter of the National Economic Commission still needs to go through legislative procedures and is not very large. The goals of the Commission's future work will focus on improving domestic rice, wheat, and cotton yarn, reviving the rural economy, and Jiangxi's bandit area. As for the principles of distributing American cotton and wheat, they have been decided long ago, but the specific methods will only be decided after expert research.</p>
<h3>Researching and Improving Domestic Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>China was originally an agricultural country, and its food was sufficient for its own supply. However, in recent years, large amounts of foreign rice and wheat have been imported, resulting in the obstruction of sales and low prices of domestic rice and wheat, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The reasons for this are (1) the poor organization of the rice market; Guangdong and Guangxi, where rice is expensive, mostly order rice from Annam and Siam, taking advantage of convenient transportation, excellent rice quality, low prices, and scheduled delivery. Therefore, even in the rice-producing areas along the Yangtze River, sales are obstructed, and foreign rice can be dumped; (2) foreign wheat is of high quality, abundant in quantity, and cheap in transportation. Shanghai and Tianjin wheat merchants mostly enjoy purchasing it; (3) Customs has never taxed grain imports, with the aim of relieving food shortages. Unexpectedly, foreign rice and wheat have been dumped in China's interior as a result, and domestic rice and wheat have been hit, causing the rural economy to go bankrupt. When the Ministry of Finance recently revised the new tariff rules, it decided to levy taxes on the import of foreign rice and wheat to relieve Chinese rice and wheat, but it has not been implemented due to opposition from Guangdong. The central government has long investigated and coordinated ways to relieve domestic rice and wheat, such as reducing transport costs. As for the fundamental method, it is to improve domestic rice and wheat. This responsibility will be borne by the National Economic Commission to research and improve domestic rice and wheat, and to prevent the import of foreign rice and wheat, in order to seek the revival of the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Saving China's Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Secondly, the improvement of cotton yarn spinning is also an important issue at present. In recent years, although the rural economy has declined, resulting in weak purchasing power and the depression of all industries, the daily necessities that depend on imports are very expensive. The import of cloth alone is worth tens of millions of yuan every year. Although state-owned yarn factories produce a portion of it, it is not enough to meet the needs of the whole country. Moreover, because state-owned factories rely on the supply of foreign cotton and are unsound in their own organization, they are at risk of failure in the face of this global economic panic. Moreover, manufacturers from various countries, especially with their strong capital and large-scale production, engage in planned dumping, using us as the tail-end of consumption. This is the multi-faceted oppression suffered by our textile industry. The decline of the yarn industry makes it impossible for farmers engaged in cotton farming to sell their products, leading to the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Therefore, its impact is not only on the textile industry, but also on the entire society. The Economic Commission will also study it to save the textile industry.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Bandit Areas Urgently Awaiting Restoration</h3>
<p>Hereafter, the work of restoring rural areas will start from the bandit areas in Jiangxi Province. Based on the past experience of failure in restoring bandit areas, we should study remedial measures. Tracing back to the time when the Communist Party armed itself in Jiangxi, it has been five or six years, and the Central Government's large-scale encirclement and suppression has also been three or four years. However, it has not been thoroughly eliminated. Exploring the source, the Communist Party took advantage of the poor economic situation in Jiangxi Province, stealing the methods of the People's Livelihood Doctrine and equalizing land rights, confiscating land, and implementing the method of "land to the tillers." Therefore, although farmers were under the oppression and terror of the Communist Party, they also welcomed it. From now on, we should feel that the government's previously determined economic policy was heading in the wrong direction. Recently, the Central Army recovered the bandit areas, and immediately recovered the land and returned it to the original owners, inviting people to claim it. However, it is not known that the landlords who were killed cannot be resurrected, and those who fled are determined not to return immediately. However, the authorities suddenly took back the land that had been distributed to the farmers. The farmers lost their land, and the land was left barren. The people's hearts were not attached, which was no different from a suicidal policy, giving the Communist Party an opportunity. This is a negligence of the government. Now the authorities are aware of this. My opinion is that the government can order the farmers in the disaster areas to continue to occupy the cultivated land, recognize the established facts, and exempt them from paying annual taxes for three years. Implement lending, regulate prices, and dredge transportation, such as table salt and cloth, essential goods, which the government purchases and sells at parity prices. The Communist Party's power will not be eliminated to this point. Therefore, the key to relieving rural areas is the relationship between material resources and talents. The majority opinion is that it will start from the bandit areas in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>The resignation of Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida and the appointment of former Ambassador to Russia Hirota as his successor has drawn worldwide attention to whether Japan's policy toward China will change. According to my observation, although the Japanese Foreign Minister has changed, the policy toward China will remain the same, continuing its policy of oppression and not diminishing its ambition for aggression. As for whether the Fifth National Congress will be postponed, it remains to be decided by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee. It is not yet decided.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Explains That the Chairman and Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce Should Be Re-elected</h3>
<p>According to inquiries from chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities about the re-election of the chamber of commerce, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was asked whether the qualifications of standing committee members or the chairman who were not drawn for duty still exist, or whether they must all be re-elected. Yesterday, a special instruction was issued, saying that the chairman and standing committee members of the chamber of commerce are all members of the executive committee. During the re-election period, even if the chairman or standing committee members are not drawn to leave their posts, but the organization of the executive committee has changed, they should be re-elected by the new and old executive and supervisory committee members.</p>

<h3>Meteorological Atmosphere of the Songkou Typhoon</h3>
<p>The Endangered Seawall Has Not Yet Been Repaired</p>
<p>Gentlemen Group Accuses the Authorities</p>
<p>Since yesterday afternoon, Wusongkou has suddenly been covered with overcast skies, and there has been a slight hurricane on the sea, showing signs of a typhoon. The endangered seawalls in the Songbao area that were in danger last time have been repaired in stages after the provincial government allocated funds to repair the various dangerous sections in the Baoshan County jurisdiction. However, the dangerous conditions of the Nan Shi Tang and Wu Mu Feng in the Shanghai city area, where the seawall body has been eroded eight layers of rocks, have not been implemented despite the fact that the Wusong Municipal Committee Office has reported to the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau and urged repairs. Therefore, the Baoshan County Seawall Protection Committee, seeing that the tidal flood of the eighth day of the eighth lunar month is imminent, and that the Baoshan section has been repaired while the Wusong section has not yet started work, is afraid that once an accident occurs, all efforts will be in vain. Yesterday, a meeting was specially convened and it was decided to send Committee Member Dong Weicheng to the Wusong Municipal Committee Office to inquire about the truth. At the same time, gentlemen of Wusong, such as Gu Tong, Zhang PanShi, and Yin Xiangsun, etc., also went to the site of the accident for inspection, and after witnessing the situation, they all accused Tang Chengzhong, the Municipal Committee member. Commissioner Tang replied that construction could begin within a day or two, and promised to send someone to urge the Municipal Engineering Bureau again.</p>

<h3>The Second Day of the Native Cloth Movement</h3>
<p>Village Women Weaving Cloth, Viewers Praising</p>
<p>Shao's Speech, Passionate and Eloquent</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Shanghai Native Cloth Movement Conference. From 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, about 100,000 people attended the conference. The exhibits in the exhibition hall were more than yesterday. In addition to the native cloth from Shanghai, Taicang, Jiading, and other places, there were also raw materials for finished cloth and a weaving machine. One village woman was weaving cloth on the machine, and the viewers praised the difficulty of making finished cloth. The Taicang native cloth has made much progress compared to the past, and the advocate of improvement is Mr. Jin Xiawen. At 2:00 PM, Mr. Tai Shuangqiu gave a speech. Mr. Tai arrived at the conference at 1:10 PM, wearing a short shirt and pants made of purple printed cloth, and native cloth shoes and socks. He was received by Zhang Yiyan and accompanied to visit the exhibition hall, and then to the reception room, where he spoke sadly about the suffering of farmers and relief methods. Mr. Tai and Zhang Yi both advocated starting with promoting native cloth, promoting native goods, and serving rural comrades, and should focus on promoting native goods during the National Goods Year to save the country. The two had similar opinions and became more and more interested in the conversation. When the bell rang, they left the reception room and entered the lecture hall. Zhang Yi introduced him first, and then Mr. Tai gave a speech. The recorders were Zhang JinKang and Zhang Huijun. Mr. Tai's voice was as loud as a bell, and at the painful point, he stomped his feet and slapped the table, moving the listeners and even bringing them to tears. After Mr. Tai finished speaking, Zhang Yi accompanied him to visit the Penglai Market. The performances that day were the harmonica, martial arts, and national music of the Public Education Museum, and the Suzhou Beach of Mr. Shen Zhisan, the songs, dances, and martial arts of the Lin Yin primary school students, especially the Suzhou Beach (self-written to persuade people to use native cloth) and the songs and dances of the Lin Yin primary school students, which were wonderful, and the applause was thunderous.

<h3>Yang Hu Talks About the Dispute Over the Change of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>According to the news from the Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union, Wang Shenggao, the director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's XinJiangtian Wheel, and Zhang Jinsheng, the director of the Jianghua Wheel, expressed dissatisfaction with the company's order to change positions and refused to hand over the duties. The trade union came forward to intervene, and the company, in order to avoid disputes, submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. After many days of deliberation, Yang Hu, a standing committee member of the union, said that the preparatory committee had not heard about this case at first. It was not until he read the news about Wang Shenggao in the newspaper on the 1st of this month that he learned that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a misunderstanding due to the negotiations of the Shanghai Seamen's Union Temporary Steering Committee. Da Chubing, the secretary of the preparatory committee, instructed Zhong Xiqiao, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Seamen's Union Temporary Steering Committee, to submit the case for handling. Unexpectedly, at this time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had already requested instructions from the Ministry, so the preparatory committee had not conducted an investigation after receiving the presentation from the union. While preparing to negotiate a solution, it suddenly received an official letter from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that Wang Shenggao had been ordered to be transferred according to the Ministry's approval. At the same time, there was also a dispute over the transfer of Zhang Jinsheng, the director of the Jianghua Wheel, which was also reported to the Ministry of Communications for approval by the Shanghai Temporary Steering Committee, and the approval was granted for transfer. At this point, the preparatory committee had a clear understanding of the two cases, but since it had already received the Ministry's clear order, it was inconvenient to make any further claims. Therefore, it sent Wang Zhonggang, a cadre, to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to copy the Ministry's approval for review, and ordered the Shanghai Seamen's Union Temporary Steering Committee to transfer the directors to comply with the order as soon as possible. In addition, no negotiations were conducted and no opinions were expressed. The outside world did not understand, causing misunderstandings and deep anxiety. In fact, the preparatory committee did not dare to make any claims on this case because the Ministry's order was in place. As for whether the directors' dereliction of duty was true, it was still difficult to see because no investigation procedures had been carried out. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did not understand the object of the negotiation, and mistakenly regarded the Shanghai Seamen's Union Temporary Steering Committee as the China Seamen's Preparatory Committee. Before reporting to the Ministry, it never consulted the association on the case and directly requested instructions, which prolonged the dispute, which was regrettable. As for the Shanghai Seamen's Union, the Temporary Steering Committee handled it poorly, and has dismissed Zhong Xiqiao, a standing committee member of the union, to show punishment, and has submitted the details of the case to the Central Committee and the Ministry of Communications. In the future, similar incidents should be handed over to the association for handling to avoid one mistake after another.</p>
<h3>The Yellow Disaster Relief Association Will Decide on the Methods of Industrial Disaster Relief and Disaster Relief at the Daily Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Disaster Relief is Divided into Four Methods</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong Will Enter Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group of the National Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, after inspecting the disaster situation in Shandong and Henan, immediately met with the members of the group to rush to draft disaster relief measures and the distribution of disaster relief funds in various provinces, prepared to take them to Beijing tonight, and submitted them to the Standing Committee of the Yellow Disaster Relief Association for decision. A reporter from the New Voice Newspaper visited Xi at the Shanghai Office of the Yellow Disaster Relief Association at No. 6 The Bund yesterday, and inquired about the disaster relief plan, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Heavily Affected Counties</h3>
<p>According to Xi, the counties that have been heavily affected by the Yellow River flood this time are Heze, Shouzhang, Jiaxiang, and Fan County in Shandong Province, Changyuan and Dongming in Hebei Province, and Hua County and Kaocheng in Henan Province. The rest have been affected slightly. Now, due to the urgent need for facts, it has been decided to go to the severely affected counties to provide assistance. However, in terms of transportation, public sentiment, and local environment, it is very difficult to provide assistance in the counties of Lu and Ji, and the provincial government has not sent anyone to go, only providing disaster relief funds to the county government for distribution. However, the association will not fail to provide assistance due to its difficulties.</p>
<h3>No Cash Released</h3>
<p>It is now scheduled to form disaster relief associations in Shandong and Henan provinces, together with local officials, gentry, and public charitable organizations, as assisting agencies. The group will also set up an inspection and distribution office as an executive agency, and a procurement and transportation office to specialize in procuring food, disaster relief supplies, etc., and transporting them. The disaster relief method is to transport essential supplies such as clothing, food, and housing to the disaster areas, and not distribute cash to avoid abuses.</p>
<h3>Four Disaster Relief Methods</h3>
<p>Regarding the disaster relief methods, it is planned to proceed in four areas: 1. Emergency relief, which is now scheduled to purchase cotton clothes, reed mats, and coarse grains, etc., to meet the urgent needs of the disaster victims. 2. Setting up shelters. 3. Congee factories. 4. Assisting disaster victims in resuming their businesses, such as providing seeds and agricultural tools. The detailed methods have not yet been determined, and need to be determined based on the funding and local situation.</p>
<h3>Entering Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>Although it was Sunday yesterday, the office staff of the group (i.e., the staff transferred from the National Economic Commission Engineering Department) all went to the meeting to work, and the work was very tense, drafting budgets, regulations, plans, etc. Xi is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight, ready to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the Yellow Disaster Relief Association for decision tomorrow, and then it can be implemented. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Zhou Xiangxian, director of the labor relief group, went to the meeting to discuss labor relief matters with Xi Dejiong.</p>
<h3>Preserve the Special Fund for Dredging Zhoupu Pond</h3>
<p>Zhoupu Pond in Pudong is the main river connecting the Shangnan and Liangnan counties. It used to be a special fund for dredging the river, but it was moved to other uses by Nan Dong, hindering dredging. Qin Xitian, a gentleman from Shanghai County, and Xing Zhigang, the chief of the fifth district, had repeatedly presented to the county government and transferred to the Nanhui County Government to thoroughly investigate the special fund, and still allocate it to interest to maintain water conservancy. Yesterday, a training order was received, saying that the Nanhui County Government's consultation was approved. According to the report of Shen Shunan, the chief of the third district, it was checked that the funds for the Shanghai Association to dredge Zhoupu Pond were stored in Zhoupu Town, Renhe Renfa Two Pawnshops. The receipts were kept by the previous autonomous organizations. When Yu Gan, the director of the Zhoupu Municipal Administration Bureau, took over, in May of the eighteenth year, he transferred the loan to the Zhoupu Nursery for the construction of houses. In October last year, Xing Zhigang, the chief of the fifth district of Shanghai, and Qin Yanqi gentleman, both sent letters to the war zone to sort things out, and said that the special funds for the Shanghai Association to dredge Zhoupu Pond should not be moved to other uses, and there have been old cases for decades, etc. Shunan immediately informed and planned to return it, and replied by letter. Now it is reported that the Zhoupu Nursery has returned the principal and interest of 794.53 yuan. Shunan takes the local public funds and will report the cause of the funds and the tracing of the original case, and then save the interest, detailing it on the left. Check that the downstream of the Nanhui Zhoupu Pond is affiliated to the 16th and 7th Pictures of Shanghai Twenty-One Protection. Sharing the water conservancy, the Shangnan and Liangnan counties were approved to be dredged equally during the Tongzhi period. During the Guangxu 17th year, Shanghai County provided 400 yuan of canal donation and transferred it to Nanhui Fashan to store interest, which was the special fund for the Shanghai Association to dredge Zhoupu Pond in the future, and the people of Shangyi were forever exempt from corvée. After the approval of the two counties, it can be seen in the Nanhui County Chronicles, (omitted). Now tracing the original case to handle it, we still need to ask for instructions to inform the pawn industry, store the interest separately, and after that, unless there is a need for Shangyi Association to dredge Zhoupu Pond, or unless we have received the information from the government, the managers must not arbitrarily withdraw or transfer loans, etc. The truth is detailed, and I request you to review and file it, and inform the Datuan Pawn Industry Association to send someone to the post to receive 794.52 yuan and store the interest. At the same time, forward it to Shanghai County for another filing to emphasize the public funds. According to this, the government's consultation was approved to thoroughly investigate the case, and the former situation was reported. In addition to ordering the industry association to receive the money for storage, the corresponding order was issued to inform the district chief, and this order was issued.</p>
<h3>All-Zhejiang Public Association's Appeal to Reduce the Two Yuan Additional Tax</h3>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which read as follows: To the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Zhejiang Province has suffered continuous natural disasters in recent years, and the people's livelihoods have been difficult, reaching a desperate situation. The numerous types of additional taxes on farmland have been increasing year after year, causing particular suffering to our people. Upon investigation, the military special tax, now renamed the construction special tax, which adds one yuan to each tael of land tax and each stone of subsidy grain, is the most substantial. We have read the Ministry of Finance's circular on reorganizing farmland tax and additional tax measures, stating that the total tax including additional levies should not exceed one percent of the land value. If the land value has not been investigated and reported, the total amount of additional levies in each locality should not exceed the regular tax. In recent years, land prices in Zhejiang have declined. Except for prosperous cities, the average price per mu (unit of land) is actually less than twenty yuan. However, the combined regular and additional taxes to be paid per mu amount to one yuan and sixty or seventy cents. In counties with the heaviest additional taxes, the tax burden exceeds two to three times the regular tax. The heavier the tax burden, the more arrears accumulate, leading to a pile-up of old taxes and difficulties for both the government and the people. Tracing back to the imposition of this special tax in Zhejiang Province, it followed the increase of five yuan per stone of grain in Jiangsu Province. It was originally intended to be levied for only one year. After the expiration of the term, the levy was extended. Despite repeated opposition from the people, the request has not been approved. Now, considering the hardships of the people's livelihood, Jiangsu Province has already reduced the newly added two yuan. Since the situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is the same, we should urgently follow the example and abolish this special tax altogether, regardless of land tax or subsidy grain, so as to alleviate the people's difficulties. Some may argue that this additional tax is currently used as a fund for construction bonds, and it is not appropriate to abolish it abruptly. However, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway project is nearing completion. Using the railway revenue to offset the fund should eliminate concerns about the fund's lack of source. Moreover, when the people's burden is lighter, payment is easier, and the farmland tax revenue can be increased compared to before, which can also make up for the shortfall. Our association cherishes the hardships of our hometown and does not hesitate to submit this petition. We respectfully request your government to consider the people's difficulties and approve the submission to the provincial government meeting to decide on the abolition, giving the people a fresh start. If five years of harsh government are cleared away in one stroke, the people of Zhejiang will have boundless love and support. We urgently submit this petition, hoping for your consideration. Respectfully, the All-Zhejiang Public Association of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China Aviation Company's Beiping Plane Scheduled for Test Flight on Chongqing-Yunnan New Route This Morning</h3>
<p>Via Chongqing, Guiyang, to Kunming</p>
<p>Opening Next Month After Successful Test Flight</p>
<p>According to the Kuomin News Agency, the Shanghai-Guangdong and Shanghai-Philippines routes planned by China Aviation Company have already been successfully test-flown. Once the shareholders' meeting makes a decision, the routes can be opened. It is now learned that the company is also planning a Chongqing-Yunnan route, from Chongqing to Kunming, to connect the Shanghai-Chengdu trunk line. This route was originally scheduled to depart from Chongqing for a test flight the day before yesterday (the 16th). However, due to bad weather, it was postponed again. It is now known that the Shanghai company had already ordered the Beiping aircraft in Hankou to fly from Hankou to Chongqing yesterday morning. It is scheduled to depart from Chongqing on the aircraft at 6:00 AM today to carry out the test flight, via Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, and ending in Kunming, Yunnan. It is expected to be opened within a month after this trip is successful.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Appeals for Disaster Relief for Shandong Province Floods</h3>
<p>The Yellow River Flood Relief Association has Already Sent Personnel with Funds for Relief</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce has reported on the disaster situation by the Shandong Heze County Flood Relief Association and requested assistance to raise large funds for disaster relief. Yesterday, it sent a special letter to Shanghai's charitable organizations to establish a joint association for emergency relief for the Yellow River floods, requesting ways to provide relief. The original letter stated: Respectfully, we recently received a letter from the Shandong Heze County Flood Relief Association stating: The Yellow River has breached its banks, and our county has suffered severe damage. We sent a telegram earlier to appeal, and we trust it has received your attention. We now specially recommend Ge Xiangyi, Ran Jiwu, and Guo Junqing to visit you and humbly request an audience, generously donate, and ask for help to raise large funds to save the disaster-stricken people. We believe you will be compassionate and willingly assist. The details of the local plight will be presented and discussed in person by the representatives. We have received this information. Although our association's heart is willing, our strength is insufficient. We are sending this letter to your association for your information, hoping you will find ways to provide relief. (The following is omitted.) It is reported that the Yellow River Flood Emergency Relief Association has already sent personnel with 30,000 yuan to Shandong Province to investigate and provide emergency relief and will send a detailed reply by letter.</p>

<h3>Huang Fu Returns North After Political Affairs are Negotiated</h3>
<p>Financial Unification is a Necessary Measure, Currently Being Discussed</p>
<p>The Central Government will Have a Solution for the Public Security Bureau Director</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Huang Yingbai, the chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Reorganization of Political Affairs in Beiping, has been in Shanghai for days, discussing North China's political and financial affairs with Wang Kemin and Li Zeyi. It was initially said that he would go to Beijing around the 14th, but the departure date suddenly became silent, causing much speculation. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter inquired with Huang in writing yesterday about North China's political affairs and the financial war zone issues. Huang replied in person, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Departure Date for the North (Reporter's question) Have North China's political affairs been negotiated? When will you return to the north? Will Mr. Wang Kemin travel with you? Huang replied, North China's political affairs are quite numerous. I will return to the north as soon as I have completed negotiations with the central government. Mr. Wang Kemin may return first or travel with me, which has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Financial Unification (Reporter's question) Regarding the solution for North China's finances, is it as reported that they will all be directly managed by the Ministry of Finance? What are the specific measures? (Huang's reply) National finances should naturally be managed in a unified manner. I have always been committed to promoting national unity, so I wholeheartedly agree in principle. As for the specific measures, they are currently being discussed.</p>
<p>Beiping Public Security Bureau (Reporter's question) What are your opinions on the trend of replacing the director of the Beiping Public Security Bureau and retaining Bao? It is rumored that you are fighting for it by threatening to resign. Is this true? Has a solution been found? (Huang's reply) The transfer of the director of the Public Security Bureau is a regular occurrence in the government, and the clear order has been issued. The central government will have a solution.</p>
<p>War Zone Inspector (Reporter's question) Regarding the establishment of administrative inspectors in the war zone and the takeover of the various passes of the Great Wall, what is the latest situation? (Huang's reply) The system of administrative inspectors is used in many provinces. North China is not specifically establishing it because of the war zone. However, we want to try out one or two districts, and it may be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Record of the Nanhui County Disaster</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society recently received a report from the district chiefs of the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Nanhui County, stating that on the evening of September 2nd, the coastal villages of these four districts suddenly suffered a hurricane and a tidal surge. Public and private levees were washed away and breached, and the water depth on the plains turned the area into a swamp. Fields, houses, livestock, and food were all swept away. People were killed and injured in their sleep. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented since the founding of the Republic. Although the water has now receded, wails of misery are heard everywhere. People are sleeping in the open air, exposed to the wind, without clothes or food. The living are crying, and the dead are exposed. Those with benevolence cannot help but shed tears. Rescue work is underway, but there is no way to provide relief to the hungry and starving people. We have always admired your society's compassion and concern for the well-being of all. We implore you to generously provide compassionate assistance and donate relief grain to benefit the survivors. On behalf of the disaster-stricken people along the coast, we respectfully beg for help. Indeed, the pleas for help from Shanchuan, Shaqidongnan, and other places are exceptionally tragic. How can we obtain thousands of buildings and thousands of large fur coats to bring these people to a city of benevolence and longevity? May compassionate people within the country and bodhisattvas make vows to jointly provide assistance, so that the suffering disaster victims can have hope for their lives.</p>
<h3>The Third Team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps Continues to Recruit New Members</h3>
<p>The Third Team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps is continuing to recruit new members. The exam was held yesterday, with more than forty applicants. Less than half of those who passed the exam were admitted, either because it was inconvenient to live or work in the concession, or because of time conflicts and business concerns, resulting in a remaining vacancy. Therefore, we are continuing to recruit one or twenty voluntary members. Any motivated young people who are willing to serve the local area can quickly register with the team. The address is the team's office in the Shanghai South District Defense Corps Headquarters, Qiaojiabang, Xiaonanmen.</p>

<h3>Funeral Procession Encountered Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Zhao Liansheng Held a Lavish Funeral</p>
<p>The Fast Son-in-Law of an Elder in the Floral Society</p>
<p>Encountered Kidnappers While Escorting the Funeral with His Wife</p>
<p>Friend Shen Yangsheng Was Abducted</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a bizarre major case resembling kidnapping, attempted assassination, abduction, and carjacking occurred at the intersection of Rue Paul Beau and Avenue Dubail in the French Concession. There were a total of four bandits, who opened fire on each other at the scene. As a result, one of them was intercepted by the police. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Acting as a Secret Agent</h3>
<p>Zhao Liansheng (aka Xiao Liansheng), a native of Ningbo, is currently thirty-two years old and lives at No. 10 Pubo Lane, a newly built building on Rue Paul Beau, near the intersection of Avenue Dubail in the French Concession. He is a handsome and extravagant young man, and the favorite son-in-law of Cao Awu, an elder in the floral society. It is said that Zhao once worked as a special Chinese policeman in the French Concession police station. Because of his intelligence and proficiency in the "Yangjingbang" version of French, he was subsequently promoted to secret agent, so he has a certain potential influence.</p>
<h3>Owns a Car</h3>
<p>Zhao is skilled at driving cars and used to swagger through the streets on a motorized bicycle. Recently, as his status and reputation have grown, he bought a new car and obtained two eye-catching permits, No. 6996 in the concession and No. 7997 in the Chinese territory. He also hired a bodyguard for protection. Zhao himself has a self-defense pistol. The chauffeur is named Zhu Yuwen.</p>
<h3>Escorting the Funeral</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the day of the funeral for Jia Yunshan, the owner of Jiafu Store at No. 25 Sanhai Lane, Rue Paul Beau, in the French Concession. Zhao was a close friend of Jia since childhood, so in the morning, he took his wife, Cao, to Jia's house to pay his respects. After the ceremony, he invited his friend (currently a jockey at the race club) Shen Yangsheng and Cao to join him in the car to escort the funeral procession. Unexpectedly, in an instant, disaster struck.</p>
<h3>Suddenly Encountered Kidnappers</h3>
<p>At that time, Zhao's car was parked at the corner of Avenue Dubail and Rue Paul Beau. The chauffeur, Zhu Yuwen, immediately started the engine when he saw his master arriving with his wife and friends. Shen Yangsheng was the first of the three, followed by Cao, and Zhao was at the rear. As Shen stepped towards the car, just as he was about to reach out to open the car door, four bandits suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two were dressed in short blue clothes, and two were wearing long black gowns. They surrounded the car at once. At the same time, the one in black gown fired a shot into the air to intimidate.</p>
<h3>Zhao's Friend Was Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Zhao was naturally alert. Seeing the situation, he knew that he had encountered bandits. He quickly retreated to the opposite side of the road, taking shelter behind a cement utility pole. At the same time, he also drew his pistol and fired two shots into the air. The other three bandits quickly forced Zhao's friend, Shen Yangsheng, into the car, ordering the chauffeur to drive the car swiftly south along Avenue Dubail. However, one of the bandits in black gowns, who was unable to get into the car in time, fled in a panic. However, after the gunshots, nearby detectives heard the sound and rushed to the scene.</p>
<h3>One Bandit Was Arrested</h3>
<p>The two Chinese detectives, No. 107 and No. 111, from the French police station arrived together, pursuing closely and relentlessly. Finally, one of them was intercepted, and a loaded pistol with nine bullets was seized. Under strict interrogation by the police chief, he confessed that his name was Gu Junshan, 27 years old, from Jiangbei. He claimed that he had come to arrest Zhao because Zhao was suspected of being a communist.</p>
<h3>Focus on Apprehending the Criminals</h3>
<p>The police chief believed that the bandit's confession was contradictory and likely untrue. The superintendent, Jin Jiulin, personally went to the headquarters to inquire about the truth. Meanwhile, he telephoned the police stations in the Public Concession and the Public Security Bureau in the Chinese territory, as well as various districts, to pay attention to the car. However, according to general speculation after the incident, it was feared that it was not purely a kidnapping, and there may be other circumstances involved. However, the police authorities predicted that the incident may be related to the strict prohibition of floral societies.</p>
<h3>All Assets of Yongyu Yarn Factory Sealed Up</h3>
<p>| Scheduled Auction to Repay Debts |</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese yarn factories have been gradually unable to compete due to the dumping and oppression of foreign factories, and the sale and closure of factories have often occurred. Now, the Yongyu Yarn Factory in Xiaoshadu, an old factory with many years of history, has also suffered from the recession and incurred heavy debts. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank and other creditors jointly applied to the Shanghai Local Court, and a judgment was made to execute and seal up all the assets of the factory. Experts were asked to estimate the minimum value of the factory's assets at 1,292,119.13 yuan. The court has now announced that the auction will be held on September 25th, and the highest bidder will win.</p>
<h3>Older Brother-in-Law Hiding Behind the Door</h3>
<p>Chen Liqiu Returned and Knocked on the Door</p>
<p>Waiting All Night to Write a Letter</p>
<p>Chen Liqiu, 32 years old, from Jingjiang, has been a dock worker. He lives at No. 32 Ninghe Road in Dananmen. His wife, Bao, has given birth to one son and two daughters. The eldest son is named Mingzu, 7 years old, the second is named Aying, 6 years old, and the youngest daughter is named Su, only 4 years old. However, although she is a middle-aged woman with children surrounding her, she still has some charm. Recently, she had an affair with her husband's cousin, Chen Rulin. Taking advantage of her husband's absence, she summoned him to her house for a secret rendezvous. The previous evening, Chen went out on business and told her to return late at night. She saw another opportunity, so she summoned Rulin to her house to have fun. Unexpectedly, they had too much fun and forgot the time, so until about 2:00 AM yesterday, they were still sleeping together intimately, enjoying their sweet dreams. Chen finished his business and returned home, raising his hand to knock on the door, which startled the pair of lovebirds from their sleep. Knowing that Chen had returned, they quickly put on their clothes and got out of bed. In a moment of panic, she hid Rulin behind the door, then went out to open the door. Chen stood outside the door knocking for a long time before he saw Bao open the door. He saw that her clothes were disheveled and she looked flustered, which aroused his suspicion. After entering the house, he immediately closed the door, when he suddenly saw a person hiding behind the door. He couldn't help but jump back in surprise. When he approached to take a closer look, he saw that it was his cousin, Rulin. Seeing this situation, Chen knew everything and was furious. He took the two of them and handed them over to Liu Chaojiang, the guard on duty at Post 17, who took them to the Third Section of the First District. When the Section Chief Jin preliminarily interrogated them, Chen Rulin confessed that he was 35 years old and worked as a tailor. That evening, he went to his cousin Liqiu's house to ask him to write a letter for him. He happened to meet his cousin Chen who was out on business, so he waited for him at his house. However, he denied having an affair with her. He was ordered to be temporarily detained for investigation before further action. At 10:00 AM yesterday, after the Section Chief Jin Dianyang interrogated the plaintiff Chen Liqiu, the defendant Chen Rulin, and the young woman Chen Bao, and each of them had made their statements, Section Chief Jin ruled that Chen Rulin and Chen Bao were both shameless. He sentenced the adulterer Chen Rulin to a fine of five yuan as a warning and ordered Chen Bao to be taken back by her husband Chen Zhiqiu. The love affair came to an end.</p>
<h3>Educational Film Association Held its First Screening of Educational Films Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan and Others Spoke on the Essentials of Film and Education</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association, in order to implement film education and ensure that members of the public thoroughly understand the content, negotiated with the Nanking Theatre on Avenue Edward VII to rent ten reels of educational films produced by the German UFA company. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the first screening of educational films was held at the theater. Those present included the executive committee members of the Shanghai Branch Tao Baichuan, Chen Bai, and Yang Minshi; the supervisory committee members Pan Gongzhan and Wu Kaixian; the mayor's representative Zhang Yuanruo; the city party headquarters representative Tong Hangbai; the education association representative Huang Zao xiong; representatives from various film companies such as Mingxing, Lianhua, and Tianyi; and representatives from various cultural institutions and schools, totaling over a thousand people. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Order: The order was as follows: (1) Music, (2) Opening, (3) Everyone stand at attention, (4) Play the party anthem, (5) Pay the highest respects to the party and national flag and the portrait of the Premier, (6) Read the Premier's will respectfully, (7) Chairman's report, (8) Mayor's address, (9) Music, (10) End of ceremony, (11) Screening of educational films.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the opening ceremony and greetings, Chairman Pan Gongzhan gave a report, saying, "Today is the first public screening of educational films by the Shanghai Branch of the China Film Association. We are deeply honored by the enthusiastic participation of all the gentlemen and ladies present. The meaning of educational films has already been reported in the booklet distributed earlier. I believe that all participants will be able to provide guidance. At the same time, I believe that film education is the most powerful tool for social education. Its impact and effectiveness far surpass other tools. Therefore, from the perspective of educational effectiveness, we should fully utilize film education to make up for past inadequacies. In the past, education relied solely on picture books and teachers' lectures, with more ideals and less experience. Especially in science, it is impossible to thoroughly understand it by relying on books and lectures. Therefore, film education is indeed a new type of education. All European and American countries have already used it as an auxiliary tool to reform society and promote education. Therefore, in the future, all general films in our country should set up educational films for students. Unfortunately, our domestic products are not yet developed, so the first step is to do what is possible within the scope of economic resources, talent, and time. (1) Before we can manufacture our own, we will try to introduce foreign educational films to the Chinese people. (2) We will actively manufacture our own domestically. The Shanghai Branch has been established for only three months, and the reason why it is screening films first is because Shanghai is the film center and also the education center. Therefore, we first negotiated with the Nanking Theatre, which enthusiastically supported us, enabling us to carry it out. We are extremely grateful. Today's screening is produced by the UFA company. Please observe how it is made and what your impressions are. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the Chinese people will work hard to manufacture their own, and on the other hand, we hope that the film and education circles will take responsibility, enthusiastically carry out, and fully cooperate to reform society and revive the nation. Today we are borrowing the Nanjing Theatre. In the future, every morning at a set time, we will screen the films for students, or in other public places or in the school auditorium, bringing the films to screen. The price will be as low as possible: one yuan per semester for university students, five cents per semester for middle school students, and five cents per visit for elementary school students, to cover the operating expenses. However, it will absolutely not be forced, but rather be voluntary, in order to achieve universality."</p>
<p>Mayor's Address: Next, Mayor's representative Zhang Yuanruo gave an address, saying, "Today, Mayor Wu is unable to attend due to other important business and has temporarily instructed me to represent him. My personal feelings about educational films and their significance have already been explained in detail by Chairman Pan. The Chinese nation was the earliest to be civilized in the world, has the largest population, and is known as the land of culture. However, in modern times, this honorable title seems to be unsustainable, because we have failed to adapt to the changes of the times and strive to progress and compete with the world. According to Chinese history since ancient times, there have been inventions in every era, which could have led to prosperity and achievement. Unexpectedly, in modern times, due to the decadence of the scholar-officials and the invasion of foreign cultures, we have relied solely on ideals and failed to pay attention to the practical aspects of social education. To revive the decaying trend and avert this crisis, it is necessary to correct the past mistakes, and then learn from others' strengths to make up for our weaknesses in order to revive the national movement."</p>
<p>Tong Hangbai's Speech: City Party Headquarters representative Tong Hangbai said, "I have some thoughts on today's educational film festival. (1) Film originally takes education as its center, because every move it makes has a great impact on society. A good film will have a good effect, and vice versa. Therefore, film must pay attention to rationalization and ensure that the public receives all impressions, so that in addition to narrow school education, it can also achieve the effect of social education. The general films in our country only know how to cater to the psychology of the audience, going beyond education, so that films that originally took education as their center cannot help education, and may even harm it. That is why there is a film education association. If we only rely on the film education association to take responsibility, the effect will be small. We must make the film industry itself change, and restore the film with education as its center. (2) Film is the most noble entertainment for the general public, so the government and various organizations must seek to universalize it, not form a diamond-like aristocracy, and promote it as much as possible, so that the working-class factory districts and farming districts surrounding the school can enjoy it equally. At the same time, I hope that the education circles, although they cannot fully achieve this now due to economic and material relations, must at least achieve the goal of film with education as its center." The speech by guest Li Shipan was omitted for length.</p>
<p>Screening Program: The program screened yesterday was as follows: (1) Travelogue of Greek Holy Sites, (2) Sea Beast Cave, (3) Jade Workers, (4) Bear Hunt, (5) Aquarium of the Zoo, (6) Colored Animals, (7) Old Friends, (8) Gold Rush, (9) Underwater Wonders, (10) Logging. The above types, mostly belonging to natural science, can enhance the general public's knowledge of physics and minerals and can supplement the knowledge of textbooks.</p>
<p>Thanks to All Sectors: The association also thanked all sectors, saying, "Yesterday, our branch held a screening of educational films at the Nanjing Theatre in order to allow members of the public to understand the content of educational films. We are deeply honored by the attendance and guidance of people from all sectors. However, we may have failed to invite everyone and the reception may have been inadequate. We hope you will understand and forgive us."</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Requests Revision of Newspaper Inspection Standards</h3>
<p>Obscene News Should Also Be Inspected Universally</p>
<p>Yesterday's Letter Requested Municipal Party Headquarters to Forward to Central Government</p>
<p>Feng Yixian, Executive Director of the Six Districts Education Association of this city, recently submitted a report to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting measures to ban obscene news. The bureau, after consulting with the Social Affairs and Public Safety Bureaus, unanimously agreed that such news directly affects the nation's dignity and the health of young people, and indirectly affects social order and national survival. However, the central government's regulations for inspecting newspapers only cover military affairs, diplomacy, and three items related to local governance and security. Although the Publication Law explicitly regulates obscene news, it is not within the scope of newspaper inspection. It was decided to send a letter through the Municipal Party Headquarters to the central government for revision. Now, the original letter from the three bureaus to the Municipal Party Headquarters is copied below: According to the report submitted by Feng Yixian, Executive Secretary of the Six Districts Education Association, "When young men and women are beginning to experience romantic feelings, they are easily tempted by external objects, leading them astray and causing lifelong regret. Therefore, all obscene books, paintings, and plays in society are strictly prohibited by local authorities to prevent evil thoughts, eliminate the source of disorder, and rectify social customs. However, it is now common to see various large and small newspapers in this city describing obscene news with unrestrained detail, deliberately exaggerating and sparing no effort to use lengthy descriptions to reveal indecent states in detail. I ask, what kind of feelings will such writings create in the minds of young men and women who read them? What kind of effects will they have on their physiology? What kind of behaviors will they engage in secretly? What kind of results will they have on their spirit, body, learning, and career? The number of those who are destroyed and fall because of this is immeasurable. The purpose of running a newspaper is nothing more than to cater to the preferences of readers, thereby expanding circulation and developing business. This is the same as selling obscene books and paintings, both being ways to make a profit. However, everyone knows that obscene books and paintings are prohibited. Officials crack down on bookstores selling them, parents and older siblings forbid their children and younger siblings from reading them, and teachers do not allow students to bring them into schools. Therefore, young people rarely see them. Newspapers, however, are a resource for the people to increase their knowledge. Everyone has to read them. Now, inserting such indecent writings into them is no different from putting poison in the nation's food. The extent and scope of the harm are truly incomparable. It is true that reporters are responsible for recording everything they hear, but social news, apart from money and gender issues, rarely has other content. This association does not advocate that all news about men and women should be deleted from newspapers. However, all indecent states can be briefly mentioned without deliberate exaggeration or unrestrained description, as if writing a novel, to stimulate the desires of young people, causing them to go astray and leave lifelong regret. I have long admired your bureau's concern for social morality and care for young people. I sincerely request that you frequently inspect the various newspapers in this city. If you find indecent writings, you should immediately issue a warning. Those who repeatedly refuse to repent should be ordered to close down, so that the root of the problem can be rectified, social customs can be improved day by day, and the number of young men and women who are destroyed and fall can be reduced day by day. This merit and virtue are immeasurable. As for other obscene books, paintings, plays, and nude dances, they are already prohibited by your bureau. However, those who are as greedy as flies and dogs are everywhere. If prevention is slightly neglected, a hundred evils will arise again. I hope that your bureau will do its utmost to eliminate the harm, pay attention at all times, and not allow it to become a long-standing habit and poison society. This would truly be a great service." According to this, on August 16th, this Education Bureau sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Safety Bureau, and they dispatched personnel to the Education Bureau to discuss the matter. The result was that everyone agreed that obscene news has at least the following impacts on society: (1) Social customs develop imperceptibly and without limit. To correct their direction, it takes a hundred years to cultivate good customs, but losing guidance can ruin the entire society's customs in a single day. In ancient China, men and women valued propriety and chastity. Since the rise of the theory of freedom, a few bad newspapers have liked its fresh terminology, easily attaching to superficialities, pursuing popularity without end, depicting scenes with detail and unrestrained description. They promote ideas without being explicit, but their influence spreads throughout society, causing young readers to enter a state of delusion. The deterioration of social customs in Shanghai is largely due to this. This is the first impact on social morality and the corruption of good customs. (2) Newspapers are reading materials for the masses. People hold one in their hands in the morning and at night to increase their knowledge and correct their character. Educators try every possible means to increase the circulation of newspapers to join the ranks of advanced countries and do their utmost in literary education. Since the emergence of obscene newspapers, with their lengthy and detailed descriptions, exaggerated headlines, and vivid colors, the efforts of editors and the calls of newspapers are all focused on this, making the status of obscene news more important than any other news. As a result, parents and older siblings warn against reading it, and elders do not want to see it. Its circulation experiences an abnormal surge for a time but will eventually suffer a powerful blow. This is another impact on promoting newspaper development and promoting social education. (3) The composition of obscene news is nothing more than starting with love, then turning into conflict or multiple love affairs, and finally leading to disturbances or murder. Once publicized by newspapers, it becomes a natural prelude. Moreover, its narrative reverses the roles of host and guest, detailing the occurrence while glossing over the consequences. The content is full of interest, inciting people to imitate without prompting them to reflect deeply. Therefore, every record in the news adds an impression to society and inevitably adds to the chaos. Although the current social unrest is not entirely due to this, the enticement and the prevalence of eroticism are also important factors. This is another impact on public order and social security. (4) Shanghai is a city where Chinese and foreigners live together. News from one newspaper is spread among both Chinese and foreigners. If obscene and indecent news is endless, what kind of system would that be? What kind of country and nation would people consider us to be? This is another impact on the nation's dignity and the perception of Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, the impact of publishing obscene news is as significant as mentioned above. The impact on social morality and the corruption of good customs is particularly consistent with Article 19 of the Publication Law, which states that publications must not contain the following four types of records: those that harm good customs. However, the punishment for obscene news according to the law is only after the news has been published. Once it has been published, tens of thousands of people have seen it. Remedying it afterward is not a fundamental solution. Since the implementation of the Shanghai Newspaper Inspection Office, it has achieved remarkable results. However, the newspaper inspection standards passed by the 54th Standing Committee Meeting of the 4th Central Executive Committee on January 9, 1933, are limited to three items: military affairs, diplomacy, and local security news. Matters concerning the nation's dignity, affecting social customs, hindering public safety, and the obscenity of the human heart have not yet been included. Considering the people's livelihood, I am uneasy. Accordingly, I am sending this letter with the facts and respectfully request that it be forwarded to the Central Party Headquarters so that the newspaper inspection standards passed by the 54th Standing Committee Meeting of the 4th Central Executive Committee on January 9, 1933, can be revised and implemented. As for public relations, the rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Lü Baolin Requests Division of Inheritance</h3>
<p>Each Side Holds Different Views, the Case is Adjourned for Retrial</p>
<p>Lü Baolin, wife of Hua Miaofu, claims to be the youngest daughter of Lü A'kui, a Ningbo native residing at 32 Mingyue Lane, Qiwupu Road. Recently, she intended to divide the family property with Lü Yuelin, A'kui's daughter who married into the family, and Songlin, the adopted son. Because Yuelin and others denied that she was their sister, Baolin filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court for the division of property, stating that her father's name was A'kui, her mother was Zhang, and they had two daughters together. The eldest daughter was named Yuelin, who married into the family and resided at home with her adopted son, Songlin. The plaintiff is the younger daughter, who was married off by her father in the 23rd day of the first lunar month of the Republic of China year 12, and it has been ten years since then. In the past, her father started his career through diligence and thrift and accumulated a considerable amount of wealth. Later, due to his old age and declining strength, when her late mother was alive, all the property was managed by her late mother. Yuelin was able to assist because she was at home. The plaintiff once deposited four gold rings, two gold bracelets, a gold lock pendant with a gold chain, a gold hairpin, two gold hoops, and a pearl flower with her late mother for safekeeping. After the late mother passed away, the defendants, being in the same house and having easy access, illegally inherited and managed the property managed by the late mother, and also seized the plaintiff's deposited ornaments as their own. When the plaintiff negotiated with them, they were evasive, saying that the property was temporarily kept in custody and would be divided later, and that the deposited ornaments would be returned, etc. The plaintiff believed it to be true and procrastinated for a long time. Unexpectedly, the defendants were insidious and secretly divided the managed property when the father was still alive, excluding the plaintiff from the division. The elderly father was weak and cowardly, and his nature was loyal and honest, and he was surrounded by the defendants, so he listened to the defendants and allowed them to do whatever they wanted. Since the property belongs to the biological father, according to the law, the plaintiff is also one of the heirs. The defendants are only custodians. Moreover, since the father is still alive, the inheritance has not yet begun, and there is fundamentally no right to divide it alone. Even if they agree to divide it, according to Article 1142, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, the inheritable share of an adopted child is one-half of that of a child born in wedlock. Now, according to the plaintiff and the second defendant, Lü Yuelin, who are direct lineal relatives of the same order, and the first defendant, Lü Songlin, who is an adopted child, the property should be divided into five shares according to law. The plaintiff and the second defendant each get two shares, and the first defendant gets one share. Now, the defendants disregard the law and divide it on their own, infringing on the plaintiff's rights, which is extremely illegal, and they refuse to return the plaintiff's deposited ornaments, which is obviously an attempt to embezzle them and should be held criminally liable. Therefore, she specially sues for the summoning and confirmation that the plaintiff has the right of inheritance, orders the defendants to hand over all the illegally divided property and re-divide it into five shares according to law, and jointly return the concealed ornaments, and orders them to bear the litigation costs, etc. After being accused by this sudden older sister, the Lü siblings immediately entrusted lawyer Chen Tingrui to submit a statement to argue that the parents of the defendants were still childless in their thirties, so they adopted Songlin as their adopted son to continue the family line. Later, they only gave birth to Yuelin, whom they cherished and loved more than anything else, and were unwilling to have her married out and separated. They had her marry into the family so that she could be by their side and bring them joy. The facts are all there and cannot be denied. Now, the so-called Lü Baolin, the defendants have no such sister, and there is no such person in the Lü clan. Her sudden appearance is very strange. Although the mother of the defendants has passed away, fortunately, the old father is still alive and can prove that there is absolutely no such thing as not recognizing one's own daughter. Now, for a person who is completely unfamiliar and unrelated to suddenly claim to be a biological daughter and request a division of property is truly unheard of. Such bizarre and absurd things actually happened in modern society, which can be said to be wishful thinking. Even if we take a step back and assume that Baolin is indeed Yuelin's biological sister, when Songlin and Yuelin were involved in a lawsuit over the division of property in the 18th year of the Republic of China, why didn't the plaintiff come forward to claim her rights or participate in the lawsuit? From this, it can be seen that Lü Baolin does not exist at all, which is very clear. Unexpectedly, in February of last year, they suddenly received a letter from lawyer Wang Peiyuan on behalf of Lü Baolin, demanding a division of inheritance and demanding the return of deposited jewelry. The defendants were baffled after receiving the letter, as if they had fallen into a fog. In addition to entrusting lawyer Chen Tingrui to refute the letter, their father, Lü A'kui, also published a statement in the newspaper. However, the plaintiff was still unwilling and filed this lawsuit, but they do not know what basis or evidence she has. If someone were to impersonate a biological daughter in order to divide the property based on such a baseless matter, then there would be countless people later who would impersonate as their biological children when someone has a little wealth. Based on the above reasons, we should ask the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit and order her to bear the litigation costs, etc. Each side holds different views. This is a rare case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong of the First Special Court held a hearing. After questioning, because further investigation is still needed, the case was adjourned. Whether the plaintiff is indeed a biological daughter will be determined in the future.</p>
<h3>Rigorous Parole Enforcement in Prison</h3>
<p>Preventing the Spread of Malaria and Other Diseases</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, this port has been experiencing continuous rain and uneven temperatures, leading to a prevalence of seasonal epidemics. Many people in the city are suffering from malaria. This disease is easily transmitted, and special attention should be paid to the large number of prisoners in the prison. The warden of the Shanghai Second Prison received an order from the Jiangsu High Court yesterday, instructing him to carefully investigate all prisoners in custody. If any of them are suffering from malaria or other infectious diseases, he should consider the severity of their cases and implement parole according to the law to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<h3>Indian Detective of Hongkou Police Station Shot by an Enemy</h3>
<p>The Assailant Escaped on the Spot, Political Motives Suspected</p>
<p>At approximately 6:30 PM yesterday, an Indian detective of the Hongkou Police Station was walking along Bazhi Road and Feilun Road when an Indian man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and, without asking any questions, fired two shots at the detective with a handgun. The detective was shot in the right foot. After being injured, the detective desperately ran towards Wusong Road and took refuge in the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade. At this time, the assailant was still chasing behind. Seeing that nearby police officers had heard the alarm and were coming to intercept him, he turned into Feilun Road and escaped without being caught. The injured detective collapsed after running into the fire brigade. The brigade and the police officers reported the incident to the police station, and the detective was transported to the police hospital for treatment. His injuries are not life-threatening. As for why the detective was suddenly attacked by someone of the same ethnicity, it is rumored that it may involve political motives.</p>

<h3>Three Extortionists Sentenced</h3>
<p>Each Sentenced to Three Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Liang Yulin, Feng Guoxing, and Li Da, for sending extortion letters to Lin Tingyou, who resides at 186 Beijiangxi Road, demanding 300 yuan, were arrested by detective Wang Debiao of the police station and brought to the First Special District Court. After repeated interrogations, Judge Xie Fen of the Special Court held a continued hearing the day before yesterday. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated that during the previous court hearing, the two defendants, Feng and Li, denied conspiracy. Now, during the adjournment, the two defendants confessed to participating in the conspiracy before the fact at the police station, and their confessions have been recorded and submitted for review. When questioned, all three defendants admitted in Cantonese that the reason for this matter was that they saw Lin Tingyou driving a newly purchased green car and suspected that he must have surplus funds, so they resorted to this tactic. The court appointed a pro bono lawyer to defend the defendants. At the conclusion of the debate, Judge Dang announced the verdict: Liang Yulin, Feng Guoxing, and Li Dayun were each sentenced to three years of imprisonment, and the extortion letters were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Accused in Murder Case Proposes Vital Evidence During Sentencing</h3>
<p>Presiding Judge, Based on Defendant's Request, Declares the Conclusion of the Debate Revoked</p>
<p>Li Guocheng from Funing, because on August 15th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, a bandit-related murder of the same kind occurred in Room 2 of the Fashangxin Hotel on Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession, resulting in the deaths of Xia Yongsheng, Jiang Yizhong, and a man surnamed Xue, and the injury of Zhong Ziqing, was arrested and the confessed murderer, Yan Jinbiao (who has already been executed), testified that Li Guocheng was the mastermind and colluded with several others, including Liu Wu and Zhang San, who are still at large, to commit the shooting. At that time, the police station was unable to arrest Li. In January of the following year, Li was handed over to the Public Security Bureau by Yan's family in Rihui Port. The Second Special District Court sent police to bring Li before the court and handed him over to the police station for investigation, and he was publicly prosecuted for premeditated murder. This case has been heard repeatedly by Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu. Li was defended by two lawyers, Shen Yushan and Zheng Sen. Yan was once brought to the court for confrontation, but Li vehemently denied being the mastermind of the murder, claiming that Yan was falsely accusing him due to a grudge and presenting counter-evidence. Later, the court repeatedly requested investigations from the Funing County Government, which delayed the case until now, one and a half years later, without a conclusion. During the court hearing on the 6th of this month, the official stated that the investigation of evidence was completed, ordered the start of the debate, declared the conclusion, and scheduled the pronouncement of the verdict for the day before yesterday. However, on the appointed day, the defendant's side presented vital evidence, claiming that Ma Buwen, a certain captain from Funing County, could prove that when the case occurred, the defendant was in his hometown cooperating with Captain Ma in suppressing bandits and handling floods, and firmly requested that Ma be summoned to the court for interrogation. Presiding Judge Wang, based on the defendant's request, considering that the case involved human lives and for the sake of caution, granted the defendant's request, declared the conclusion of the debate revoked, and scheduled another hearing and reopened the debate. The defendant, Li Guocheng, was ordered to be returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Opening of Four Major Distribution Centers Today</h3>
<p>The long-awaited opening of the four major distribution centers of the Family Industrial Cooperative, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, China Yapu'er Electric Appliance Factory, and China Ceramics Company is scheduled for 2 PM today, and an opening ceremony will be held on the radio. The ceremony will be broadcast simultaneously by the Yongsheng Fuxing Suo radio station. The opening program includes: (1) Party Song, (2) Opening Ceremony, (3) Reading of the Will, (4) Speeches by Mayor Wu, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, and Wang Xiaolai on the National Humiliation of September 18th, (5) Zheng Zhengqiu, Hu Die, and other stars will jointly broadcast a play titled "Blood Stained Changchun" to awaken the people's hearts and struggle together. The solemnity and grandeur of the ceremony are unprecedented. Moreover, holding the opening ceremony on the radio is a first in China. Although people from all walks of life may not be able to attend the grand event in person, they can still listen to the grand occasion on the radio. The situations of each factory are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Family Industrial Cooperative The Silver Dream is a makeup palace made entirely of glass and mirrors. Behind each bright and sparkling glass cabinet stands an amiable woman to greet customers. The room is full of light from the floor to the ceiling, but no electric lights are visible. A rose-purple light emanates from the walls, making you feel sweet when you are in it. This is the construction organization of the Invincible Brand distribution center of the Family Industrial Cooperative. It took four months of operation, 30,000 yuan, and countless demolitions and reforms to create the most modern building in Shanghai. It has no dependence or imitation, no Parisian or New York Western style, and naturally becomes a creative image. This is commendable. It is also equipped with two or three hundred kinds of exhibits, colorful and dazzling, and there are September 18th commemorative products, with as many as five or six kinds per set. The original price ranges from one yuan to two or three yuan, but all are sold for 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 8 li. It uses a dauntless spirit to sacrifice without the slightest deception. This is admirable. The second is the pharmaceutical department, and the third floor is the business department, which is completely managed by scientific methods. The organization is sound, and the spirit is sufficient. The downstairs retail department is headed by Director Sun Guangjun, the second-floor pharmaceutical company is headed by Dr. Tang Jia, a medical doctor from the United States, the third-floor advertising department is headed by art expert Gao Kuizhang, the wholesale department is headed by Director Du Chengshou, the accounting department is headed by Director Wu Hongruo, and the general affairs office is headed by Director Tu Xiaochao, who is stationed in the factory. The business department is entirely controlled by Manager Chen Xiaodie, who manages and controls everything. The factory work is managed by Manager Li Xinpu. Tianxu Wo Sheng has devoted himself to the real industry for fifteen years and has achieved this result. He has the assistance of Li Xinpu and his son Chen Xiaodie in management, like a sound mind with two strong arms to assist him. It is appropriate that the three words "Invincible Brand" are popular throughout the country, creating an invincible world.</p>
<p>Zhanghua Woolen Mill Su Wu's Great Success In the past, Su Ziqing herded sheep, and although he swallowed fat and gnawed on snow, he achieved nothing except not surrendering. Every year, wool from Zhangjiakou, Mongolia, and other places was exported to foreign countries, made into woolen cloth, and sold to China, leaking hundreds of millions of dollars. Zhanghua was founded by Liu Hongsheng. At first, the Chinese did not pay attention to it, and it suffered huge losses. Later, Cheng Nianpeng was appointed as manager and vigorously revitalized it, becoming a major tycoon in the woolen textile industry. The Nanjing Road distribution center was designed by Yilin Company and is beautifully decorated, winning with sophistication. There is also a September 18th serge exclusively for September 18th commemorative products.</p>
<p>Yapu'er Electric Appliance Factory The Electric World Yapu'er Electric Appliance Factory was originally founded by a German merchant and failed. Qin Runqing, Wang Boyuan, Liang Chenlan, and other giants in the financial world recovered all the machinery of the factory at a heavy price to manufacture it in China. Only then could China have its own manufactured light bulbs. General Manager Hu Xiyuan is also a major maverick in the industrial world, with a keen mind and a clear mind. He created the factory with one hand and is engaged in various equipment and inventions such as motors, electric lights, fans, and radios. The factory has never had a distribution center before. Now, a distribution center is established at the original site of Ganyi Enterprise Bank on Beijing Road to facilitate customers.</p>
<p>China Ceramics Company The Glass World</p>
<p>Before the ceramics company, Chinese crucibles all came from Japan. Only after the ceramics company was established did China have crucibles. Manager Hu Zu'an is careful, cautious, capable, and promising. The goods he produces are strong and durable. Fire bricks and crucibles are important tools for the industrial world. Their adhesion, strength, fire, and pressure must be thoroughly researched to be considered perfect. The factory carefully selects domestic raw materials and hires expert engineers to study them carefully, and the results are excellent, which has always been praised by the industrial world. Recently, it has been working hard on engraved glass, adding new German machinery. The various utensils produced are no different from imported products, which is a first in China. There are many styles, such as the newly opened distribution center of the company on Guosanyang Jingqiao. The various products displayed are dazzling and beautiful, as if entering a glass world.</p>
<h3>Accountant Association Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>Letter of Thanks: The Accountants Association of the Republic of China was established on the 9th of this month and held a representative conference for eight consecutive days. The executive and supervisory committee members and standing committee members were elected, and dozens of proposals from various public associations were resolved. It closed yesterday. Various organizations, groups, and factories in this city invited the representatives to visit, including the Municipal Government, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, University Federation, Banking Association, Money Trade Association, Central Mint, Nanshi Water and Electricity Plant, Bill Exchange, Shenxin Fifth Textile Factory, Watson Electric Factory, Shanghai Lamp Factory, Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, Shen Family Garden, etc. It is impossible to list them all. The association's letter of thanks is recorded below, expressing gratitude for the presence and generous hospitality from all sectors during the association's inaugural meeting, with flattering words of praise. We are deeply honored and will dedicate ourselves to our duties, strive for progress, and live up to the high expectations. This is a respectful thank you. The First Plenary Representatives of the Accountants Association of the Republic of China respectfully thank you.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Accountants Association of the Republic of China: Our country's loose economic organization and backward industrial and commercial enterprises have caused the entire people's livelihood problem to groan in distress under the oppression of various natural and man-made disasters. Seeking the factors of this phenomenon, its structure is not simple, but the biggest problem, in terms of governance, is the lack of a system for promoting benefits and preventing malpractices. As a result, the entire society is almost shrouded in corruption and chaos. Traitors cannot be punished, and the loyal cannot be protected. All enterprises, in this environment, cannot make long-term progress. At a time when the Chinese people are facing unprecedented difficulties, to seek self-reliance and survival, we must strive for political and economic integrity. Therefore, the treatment of the above-mentioned diseases is the common responsibility of the Chinese people, and accountants, in the position of economic doctors, should especially not shirk their responsibility to serve society. Accountants in our country have existed for 20 years, and nearly a thousand people are engaged in this profession. Although their contributions to society have progressed with the times, they have still not become a universal need. Only a small part of the industrial and commercial sectors use this specialized labor to guide the advancement of their businesses. Compared with Europe and the United States, we are far behind. The reason for this is that accountants have failed to work together to establish the grand rules of this profession, to arouse social awareness, and to establish a sound organization. Looking back at the accounting organizations, since the establishment of the Shanghai Public Association in 1925, due to the needs of the times, various places have successively established them, gradually spreading throughout the country. However, the regions are scattered, without a centralized organization, and the strength is inevitably weak. Therefore, in terms of business, there can be no mutual connection, no overall measures. To avoid this shortcoming, this is the reason for the establishment of the Accountants Association of the Republic of China. At the beginning of the association's launch, we knew that the expectations of society were extremely earnest, and the colleagues who participated also thought about revealing the main purpose to encourage themselves. Therefore, on the day of its establishment, we dared to present four things to the people of the country:</p>
<p>1. Improve service efficiency: If accountants want to gain the trust of society, they should have sufficient preparation for the technical, academic, and disciplinary conditions required for their services, so that they can arouse social belief. This is what colleagues should strive to do.</p>
<p>2. Establish an accounting system: The public and private accounting systems in our country are still mostly chaotic. Theory and practice often do not communicate. As a result, the financial situation is concealed and unclear, and the entire organization is becoming increasingly disorganized. It is necessary to innovate. Regardless of the type of organization or business, a new system should be established. This is what colleagues should strive to do.</p>
<p>3. Promote credit efficiency: The use of credit is an essential plan for developing the social economy. Accountants use their independent and impartial spirit to provide comprehensive and accurate proof. People in the society can take the results as a reference for investment. As a result, financial credit is increasingly promoted, and social funds are increasingly circulated. This is what colleagues should strive to do.</p>
<p>4. Promote production enterprises: Accountants use their professional skills to guide the norms of industrial and commercial management, the control of budgets, the calculation of costs, and the ways to promote benefits and eliminate malpractices, which can make production enterprises vigorously advance. This is what colleagues should strive to do.</p>
<p>Today, with the promotion of the world trend, our country's social system will inevitably tend towards a controlled economy. The application of accounting will be even more complicated, and the efforts of colleagues should be intensified. Since accountants are aware of the importance of the mission they shoulder, they should be diligent and strive to promote the soundness and prosperity of the entire social system. We also hope that the government will provide strong promotion and that people from all walks of life will provide continuous support, so that public and private political affairs and the national economy will benefit from it.</p>
<h3>Nine Factories National Goods Second Temporary Bazaar</h3>
<p>Opening Today</p>
<p>For the sake of commemorating the September 18th Incident, various national goods factories in this city have jointly organized the Second Temporary Bazaar of National Goods from Nine Factories, with eighteen national goods factories in this city participating. The location is the former site of the St. George Dance Hall at the Jing'an Temple tram stop. The date is scheduled for twenty-three days, starting from 9:18 AM today until October 10th, from the National Humiliation Memorial Day to the National Day Memorial Day. Daily business hours are from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. The details of the bazaar are listed below:</p>
<h3>Bazaar Organization</h3>
<p>All the expenses of the bazaar are borne by the factories. Each factory pays a membership fee of 200 yuan. If this is not enough, the factories will share the expenses based on their business volume. The bazaar staff is composed of representatives from each factory. The entire bazaar is divided into thirty-seven rooms, which are determined by each factory.</p>
<h3>Bazaar Layout</h3>
<p>The bazaar is located along the Jing'an Temple tram stop, Hai Ge Road intersection, and the St. George Dance Hall. At the main entrance, there is a horizontal plaque that reads "Second Temporary Bazaar of National Goods from Nine Factories," with a pine and cypress archway erected and dazzling electric lights. Inside the bazaar, there are also eye-catching slogans posted.</p>
<h3>Bazaar Staff</h3>
<p>Director: Fang Yexian; General Manager: Wang Hanqiang, Xu Jianruo, Ying Sunling, Zhang Aitang. The entire bazaar is divided into five departments: General Affairs, Accounting, Cashier, Bazaar Affairs, and Publicity. The staff of each department is served by Xie Junyuan, Xu Yunhui, Ni Baiyan, and others.</p>
<h3>Bazaar Declaration</h3>
<p>The second anniversary of the tragic September 18th Memorial Day is approaching, and the Second Temporary Bazaar of National Goods from Nine Factories is also opening on this day. We hereby issue a declaration: Since September 18, 1931, the people of the country have known to promote national goods. However, promoting national goods is by no means empty talk or slogans that can hope for success. All compatriots in the country must work together to achieve it. If consumers can promote national goods as much as possible and use national goods consistently, and factories can improve their products and reduce costs, then even if foreigners want to conquer our country with economic policies, they will be prevented by the facts. If so, the poverty of China may have hope of revival. Therefore, our factories are based on this purpose. In the first bazaar last year, we gathered nine national goods factories with like-minded people and opened at the former site of the Qihua Company on Nanjing Road on the September 18th Memorial Day. We jointly sold the products of each factory at low prices for a week. The significance is to enable the people of the country to increase their opportunities to identify national goods and cultivate the psychology of loving and using national goods. In the second bazaar, the number of national goods factories participating with like-minded people, including the China National Goods Company, has increased to eighteen. We continue to use the old name, continue our original intention, and still set the opening on the September 18th Memorial Day. The goods displayed in the bazaar are extremely beautiful, and the prices are very low. We respectfully hope that the people of the country will come and give us guidance.</p>
<h3>Participating Factories</h3>
<p>The basic factories are China Chemical Industry Society, Sanyou Industrial Society, Wuhe Weaving Factory, China Enamel Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, China First Knitting Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, and other nine factories.

<h3>Gambler Seizes Gun, Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>| Bullet Grazes Chinese Constable's Face |</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, two Chinese constables from the Xinzha Patrol Room were patrolling to the intersection of Avenue Road and Fuxu Road when they saw six or seven hooligans gambling on the sidewalk. When they tried to arrest them, the hooligans resisted. One of the Chinese constables, seeing the situation was not good, took out his gun to show off. The gamblers dispersed and fled. The Chinese constable took a few steps to chase them, but unexpectedly, the group of gamblers turned back and pressed the Chinese constable's hands to seize the gun he was holding. As a result, a dispute arose between the two sides. Inadvertently, the button was touched, and with a loud bang, the bullet flew out and grazed the Chinese constable's face. Fortunately, another Chinese constable arrived soon after and helped to arrest two of the gamblers involved and took them to the patrol room for questioning. The injured Chinese constable was sent to the hospital for treatment. Because the injury was very minor, he was discharged after bandaging.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Accident</h3>
<p>| Kills a Man |</p>
<p>Jiangbei native Zhao Sufeng, 43 years old, lived at a certain number on Hongqiao Road in Hongkou and worked as a blacksmith. At about 7:15 PM last night, he went out from home. After walking a few steps, he was knocked to the ground by a bus on Route 11, his skull was crushed, and he died immediately. Constable No. 280 found out, copied the driver's license number, and waited for the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiting National Goods Tax Bill Case Opens</h3>
<p>| Trial in the First Special Court on the 19th |</p>
<p>It was previously found in Shenxin Yarn Factory that its products, Zhong brand cotton yarn, were purchased from ten factories, including Sanyang Yukang, using Japanese-made Dakang Factory cotton yarn, impersonating Shenxin's Zhong brand products. Shenxin seized the altered tax bills as evidence and hired lawyer Sun Zuji to sue the First Special District Court. It is now learned that the case is scheduled to open in the Criminal Third Court at 3:00 PM on the 19th of this month. It is also heard that when Shenxin Factory filed the lawsuit, the owner of Sanyang Factory represented the other nine factories to Shenxin, but Shenxin found that each of the counterfeit merchants had mixed Japanese yarn with Shenxin cotton yarn for more than 40,000 pieces, worth more than 11 million yuan. The losses to Shenxin are quite large, especially since Shenxin has recently received letters from groups such as Chujian and Chujian, stating that if Shenxin Factory reconciles and does not deal with the counterfeit merchants according to law, Shenxin will be severely warned, etc. Therefore, Shenxin Factory has to resort to law to solve this case for the sake of loss and reputation.</p>
<h3>Fourth Citizen Council Concludes Medical Treatment and Medicine Distribution</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizen Union Association, for the sake of benefiting the poor and sick, held a summer medical treatment and medicine distribution. Since its opening, it has been three months, and more than 100 people have registered for treatment every day. The results are excellent, but due to the implementation of medicine distribution, the cost is quite high. Therefore, after the three-month period expires, it is difficult to extend the period. The association convened a joint meeting of the Executive Supervisory Committee and the Medical Committee the day before yesterday and resolved to prepare for the end. In addition to the original budget of 600 yuan, more than 1,000 yuan is now needed. The shortfall will be raised by the members.</p>
<h3>Fire in Wengjia Lane</h3>
<p>Who Exactly Was the Fire Starter?</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM yesterday, a fire broke out in No. 1 Pinji Lane, Wengjia Lane, in the city. The second landlord of the house, Yan Shoushi, went out to report. Wang Baoying of the 31st Post of the 1st Sub-District of the 2nd District arrested him and reported to the Fire Brigade to send a car to the scene to put out the fire. Two houses were destroyed. Yan Shoushi was taken to the station. According to his confession, he was making samples downstairs, and Zhao Deqin's child upstairs shouted for fire and went out for help and was arrested. Zhao Deqin was immediately summoned, and she confessed that the fire started in the back building, but the tenant of the back building had escaped. The case will be sent to the General Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>Shanghai City Games Ball Games Second Day</h3>
<p>No Unexpected Changes in Victory and Defeat</p>
<p>Haixing Women's Volleyball Team Defeats Minli</p>
<p>Today Men's Volleyball and Women's Softball Begin</p>
<p>Haixing Wuben Today's Decisive Women's Volleyball Championship</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the City Games ball games. The important game was women's volleyball Haixing vs. Minli, evenly matched and difficult to resolve. After five rounds of intense confrontation, Haixing won the final victory. Others, such as football and basketball, were one-sided, and there were no unexpected changes in victory and defeat. Today's women's volleyball Haixing Wuben final in the afternoon is a very noteworthy event. The two teams will face off at the China Football Field at 4:30 pm. The two teams are powerful in Shanghai, and those who love this sport will definitely flock to it to be the first to see it. Others, such as men's volleyball and women's softball, will begin today. Donghua will also have to play in the football game. There is no basketball game in the evening. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Basketball</p>
<p>Xiaguang Wins Jiangwan (Men's)</p>
<p>Chongde Beats Haixing (Women's)</p>
<p>Jinan Defeats Qingbai (Men's)</p>
<p>There were not many spectators for basketball last night. Xiaguang won Jiangwan with 55 to 21. The first half was quite tense, and the second half was one-sided. In the second women's game, Chongde was lively and good at fighting, responding to each other, and complementing each other, winning Haixing with 38 to 12. Jinan defeated Qingbai with 57 to 28 with meticulous work.</p>
<h3>Xiaguang Wins Jiangwan (Men's)</h3>
<p>Xiaguang mobilized the entire army to restore the old front line, and the combat power was particularly strong. Jiangwan was like a hero of the grass, disorganized but ambitious and not showing weakness. The situation was fierce. Jiangwan took the lead and scored five points first. Xiaguang was confident and not flustered. Ren Jiexing appeared and disappeared unpredictably, and there were many seedlings. Jiangwan's resistance was strict, but the shots were not accurate, and the situation was scattered and chaotic, lacking interest. Xiaguang had 19 points in the first half and Jiangwan had 12 points. In the second half, both sides committed many fouls, and Jiangwan became more and more unsustainable, while Xiaguang became more and more dominant. Ren Jiexing scored a lot of points, and the team's connection was good, and the work was tense, becoming a one-sided situation. As a result, Xiaguang won with 55 to 21. When it was 51 to 21, Jiangwan's Zhang Jinxiang was sent off after four fouls, and there was no substitute, so he only fought with four people to end the game.</p>

<h3>Chongde Wins Haixing (Women's)</h3>
<p>Although Haixing has Chen Yingrui, Guo Xiaoping, and Zhou Xianyan's younger sister Zhou Lai, who came to Shanghai from Beiping, because they have not played this tune for a long time, they were hastily assembled, and it is naturally difficult to have a good performance, resulting in the defeat of the rising new army Chongde. The Chongde team members are petite and exquisite, and their combat is quite patterned. The defense is tight, and the shots are accurate. The three forwards have average skills, so they can complete the beautiful technique in one go. Haixing is inferior in comparison and at a loss. As a result, Chongde won with 38 to 12.</p>

<h3>Jinan Wins Qingbai (Men's)</h3>
<p>The Qingbai team is a mixed team of former Qingguang and Zhizhi alumni. In terms of talent, they are all top-notch choices, but in terms of combat, they are not very good. Jinan's work is meticulous and frequently on track. Yin Guiren and Han Zhenyuan are particularly outstanding. The newly joined former Datong University star Wang Weixi has greatly increased its combat power. In terms of the situation, Han Zhenyuan opened the record, and Qingbai Yu Shaozi returned a goal. From then on, Jinan advanced step by step, reaching eight to two. Qingbai chased to eight to eight. This was the most tense period, and also the golden age of Qingbai. But from then on, Qingbai fell into a slump, and the world was entirely Jinan's until 24 to 8. Qingbai scored a goal first, and the first half ended. Jinan won with 30 to 12. The situation did not change in the second half. Qingbai was always inferior and unable to recover. As a result, Jinan had 57 points and Qingbai had 28 points.</p>

<h3>Football</h3>
<p>Jinan Defeats Feigong Greatly</p>
<p>Youyou Painfully Beats Ling Team</p>
<p>All One-Sided Situations</p>
<p>Yesterday's football, a total of two games, were all one-sided situations. Jinan defeated Feigong with 16 to 0, and Youyou defeated Ling team with 6 to 1. The Ling team is the incarnation of youth, and is a member of the Chinese Football Association's Zhongzi group. Its strength is acceptable, but its movements are too excessive.</p>
<p>Jinan Defeats Feigong Jinan first fought Feigong, like a whirlwind sweeping away the clouds. The situation was one-sided. Feigong is a new brigade organized by fellow merchants of Feihua. Its spirit, energy, and strength are not superior to others. It is crushed by the Jinan Iron Cavalry who has experienced hundreds of battles. It is not allowed in reason that it will not be defeated. However, Feigong, as a small and weak nation, resolutely embraces the spirit of fearlessness and fights to the end. It can be said that it uses its arms to stop a car. It is not ashamed even if it is humiliated. Although it was defeated by 16 to 0, it is still worthy of our praise.</p>

<p>Youyou Defeats Ling Team Before the battle between Youyou and Ling team, most people did not dare to predict who would win or lose. Although Dong Youyou is one of the famous teams at sea, the Ling team is the essence of Shanghai West Football, a collection of elite, that is, youth. Based on the strength of the past two years, it is enough to compete with Youyou. The battle is bound to be fierce. It is known that the Ling team lacks practice, and the old tune is repeated. It is inevitable that the hands and feet will be rusty. They lost four goals in the first half. They worked hard in the second half. After Youyou continued to score two goals, they worked hard to counterattack, and Zhu Xiaorong broke Tang Li, making the score six to one. Not long after, the curtain closed in the silk wind.</p>

<h3>Volleyball</h3>
<p>Ladies First Try Their Skills</p>
<p>Haixing Team Fortunately Wins Minli</p>
<p>Wuben Team Greatly Defeats Guoguang</p>
<p>The women's volleyball competition started first, and the game was held at the China Football Field yesterday afternoon. The battle between Haixing and Minli was very important and the most tense. After five rounds of fierce confrontation, Minli unfortunately suffered a crushing defeat, which was a pity. Wuben killed Guoguang with three straight sets, leaving no one unscathed. Wuben only scored six points first.</p>
<h3>Haixing Fights Fiercely Against Minli</h3>
<p>Minli's backbone, Huang Xingfen, is the Cao Yanzan of women's volleyball at sea. She jumps and kills, and has the style of a hero. Moreover, the whole team is average, and the response is appropriate, worthy of being a strong women's team. Haixing's lineup has been greatly renewed, recruiting many veteran stars, all of whom are famous heroines at sea, but lacking training, the lineup is not tight. Minli showed great female power, taking the lead and winning the first game with 21 to 12. In the second and third silver games, you came and went, killing fiercely, each making achievements, and it was difficult to separate. Haixing then won two games in a row with 23 to 21 and 22 to 20. Seeing this score, it can be seen how fierce the competition is. In the fourth game, Minli also led far with 21 to 17. In the fifth game, the life and death situation, both sides were careful and dared not go far. The score was often on the horizontal line, and it was difficult to distinguish. Finally, Tang Dong, Changli, also suffered a crushing defeat with 20 to 22.</p>

<p>Wuben is the women's volleyball champion at sea. The talent is outstanding and the attainments are profound. Zhang Biru, Xue Zhijie, and Jieying have been on the battlefield for a long time and have made outstanding achievements. This City Championship has great hope. Yesterday's battle with Guoguang was a small test of their skills, winning three games in a row, which was easy and extraordinary, and only lost six points.</p>

In the four singles groups, Miss Wang Dale obtained victory without labor because her opponent Ms. Liu Sui abstained. Miss Mao Yuwen, the Nanjing Open women's singles champion, gently extended her jade arms and greatly defeated Ms. Li Quan, without any effort. She is highly expected to win the championship. Huang Zhifang's victory over Yang Sen, a basketball player from Nanjiang, was also very easy. The match between the sixteen-year-old girl Xia Lanzheng and Bao Lengxue took three sets to determine the winner. The results of each group are as follows:</p>

<h3>China Swimming Research Association Successfully Holds Sea Crossing Race</h3>
<p>Shi Xinglong Wins the Championship</p>
<p>The long-publicized 2000-meter Gaoqiao sea crossing competition has been postponed many times due to wind and waves or unfavorable weather. The organizers and sponsors have exhausted countless efforts. Yesterday, the sky was overcast and the wind was strong, and the waves were as high as ten feet. It was bound to be postponed again. However, due to the gradually cold weather and the enthusiastic expectations of all parties at the scene, it was decided to proceed at risk. In the morning at 10 o'clock, more than 40 athletes, mostly veterans and skilled technicians, gathered at the Hai Hotel. Mr. Yang Hongkui and Zhao Panshi of the hotel warmly received them. After the meal, Yu Binqi, Wang Jianxin, Yang Weiliang, etc. of the association issued orders to prepare for departure. Half a dozen lifeboats and more than 40 lifebuoys were used to transport the athletes to a distance of 2000 meters. At noon, the cannon was fired and the athletes entered the water. Five minutes later, Shi Xinglong took the lead. At 1000 meters, Yang Yuanhua and Li Rixin advanced side by side. At this time, the waves were splashing, and only the heads of people were seen undulating on the water. It was truly a magnificent sight unprecedented in Shanghai. In the last 200 meters, Mr. Shi swam quickly to the finish line. Yang and Li competed fiercely. Five or six hundred spectators cheered in unison. All the players landed safely. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, after the athletes warmed up and had a full meal, Mr. Yu and Wang of the association reported on the process of initiating the sea crossing competition and the hardships of the competition. Now it has all been successfully completed. Ms. Xu Zhongji presented the awards.</p>
<p>(1) Shi Xinglong Score 35 minutes 46 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Yang Yuanhua Score 39 minutes 25 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Li Rixin Score 40 minutes</p>
<p>After this, Zhou Keheng, Zheng Guanxian, Zhang Renheng, Feng Songqian, etc. all swam to the shore within 50 minutes. The first place won a silver shield from Mayor Wu and a silver cup from the Director of the Public Security Bureau. The second place won a cup from the President of the Swimming Association, Wang Xia. The third place won a silver cup from Director Xu of the Public Works Bureau and each person received a prize flag from the Xiexing Sports Equipment Company.</p>
<h3>Senior Singles Tennis Semi-Final</h3>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Loses Again Wang Wenzheng Gains Final Qualification</p>
<p>4 to 6, 7 to 5, 3 to 6, 6 to 2, 6 to 3</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Wins Yu Tianguang One Set Was Not Finished</p>
<p>The result of yesterday's semi-final of the all-Chinese men's senior singles of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club was that Wang Wenzheng eliminated Zheng Zhaojia after a fierce battle of five sets, gaining the final qualification. The score was 4 to 6, 7 to 5, 3 to 6, 6 to 2, 6 to 3. This was Zheng Zhaojia's second defeat to Wang Wenzheng this year. In another group, Qiu Feihai defeated Yu Tianguang by eight to six in the first set. The game was suspended due to the late hour and will continue next Saturday.</p>
<h3>Guests Suffer Competition Delayed Wang Wenzheng Wins Zheng Zhaojia Again</h3>
<p>Due to the bad weather, with intermittent rain, this important senior singles semi-final, although all the players were Chinese, was not crowded with spectators. They were sitting scattered around. The game was originally scheduled to start at 2:30 pm, but it was delayed for an hour due to Zheng Zhaojia's failure to attend on time. As a result, the second game between Qiu and Yu could not be finished. The guests sat bored until after 3 o'clock before they saw Xiao Zheng arriving slowly, and the guests suffered greatly.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia Could Have Won but Lost</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Zheng Zhaojia was more energetic when he met Wang Wenzheng. He was full of energy at the beginning. The first and third sets were the most exciting. He lost the second set due to laziness, and the fourth and fifth sets were worse and worse, unbearable to hear. Zheng Zhaojia failed to win the second set, which was the most important key, and in the fourth and fifth sets, when he had a glimmer of hope to save the situation, he still failed to take another step, which is a pity. Wang Wenzheng did not reduce his previous state. It is commendable that he was able to remain consistent from beginning to end and was able to rise up and defeat his opponent in the last set when the situation was very bad.</p>
<h3>The First Set Was Tense</h3>
<p>The game started hastily at half past three. Zheng Zhaojia had the right to serve first. Wang Wenzheng hit the net four times in a row. Wang Wenzheng served, and the two began to fight. Both used diagonal shots, which were tight and spectacular. Wang finally won. Zheng used a wild ball to give away his serve. Wang then took the lead with three to one. Zheng took advantage of Wang's net error and also won three games in a row, taking the advantage with four to three. After each four, Zheng served and missed an excellent opportunity, making the score equal. Then Wang took the lead by one point. This was a game that swayed the situation. Just as it was swaying, Wang suddenly hit the net three times in a row. Xiao Zheng then won the first set with six to four with an excellent sideline shot.</p>
<h3>Wang Wenzheng Fought Hard to Win Back</h3>
<p>After the tense first set, the situation suddenly turned into dullness and slowness. Zheng Zhaojia was no longer as powerful and agile as in the first set. Wang Wenzheng also showed signs of fatigue. Zheng Zhaojia served, and the server won. One game after another, until it became each four and each five. Zheng won five to four with a hard fight, but could not break the next game, so it became five to five. Xiao Zheng served, and finally Wang broke through with a touch-and-bring ball, taking the lead again, and then won back a set with seven to five, making the situation each one. In this set, Zheng often used accurate diagonal shots to attack, making Wang run east and west, but he was too slow to strike, and a shot in the left corner could not be followed by a shot in the right corner, allowing the opponent to recover to the original position calmly. This was one of the important reasons why Xiao Zheng could not win this set. From then on, the situation changed.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia Quickly Caught Up</h3>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia seemed to suddenly perk up again in the third set, or he realized the danger of being lifeless. His powerful corner shots allowed him to occupy an extremely advantageous position with a two-to-one set. The shots became smoother and more satisfactory, with a completely victorious spirit. No one expected that he would be completely defeated in the last two sets. Wang Wenzheng took the lead with two to one. Zheng won with a heavy shot and a sliding game, turning the score into three to two, four to three. Finally, he finished the game with a touch-and-bring ball. Wang lost the third set with six to three. If Xiao Zheng had won the second set, the outcome would have been decided early. After a ten-minute break, Wang Wenzheng suddenly turned the tide and won two sets in a row, which was also unexpected.</p>
<h3>Last Two Sets: The Situation Greatly Changes</h3>
<p>In the final two sets, the situation suddenly changed greatly. Wang Wenzheng served first, winning three games in a row. His energy suddenly surged, while Zheng Zhaojia lost his grip completely, with shots often going out of bounds. After Wang Wenzheng won three games, Zheng Zhaojia took back two. In the sixth game, he failed to hold his own serve, and Wang won the fourth set 6-2, evening the score. In the final deciding fifth set, Little Zheng remained in a slump. Wang again took an early lead of 3-0. Zheng Zhaojia, taking advantage of Wang's foot pain, won back three games, but still could not salvage the situation. Making numerous mistakes, he lost three more games in a row, ultimately losing the decisive fifth set 6-3.</p>
<h3>Old Qiu Wins First Set Against Little Yu</h3>
<p>| 8 to 6 |</p>
<h3>Yu Tianguang: A Formidable Force</h3>
<p>The match between Qiu Feihai and Yu Tianguang began a little after 5 o'clock. Unexpectedly, Little Yu secured the first set against Old Qiu, taking an early lead of 5-2, and then 6-5. Unfortunately, he couldn't maintain this momentum. Yu Tianguang's hitting technique was clever, rarely making mistakes, using feints and diversions, and frequently employing net play and kill shots with great effectiveness. One of his tactics involved hitting a deep corner shot followed by another shot to the opposite corner, leaving Qiu Feihai helpless. His cross-court shots were also excellent. Yu won the first set. After a 1-1 tie, Yu then led 3-1, eventually making it 5-2. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, Old Qiu tightened his grip on his racket, winning three games in a row to make it 5-5. Yu then took the lead again at 6-5. Finally, Qiu won three more games in a row, winning 8-6. The two will continue their match on Saturday.</p>

<p>Setting Standards for Establishment and Expenditure Allocation</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) In order to rectify secondary schools in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education has drafted standards for the establishment and expenditure allocation of secondary schools in various provinces and cities. On the 17th, it submitted these standards to the Executive Yuan for review. After approval, it will order all provinces and cities to comply.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 17th) The Ministry of Education has formulated multiple measures for provinces and cities to promote vocational education, which will be announced and implemented in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu: Recent Twists and Turns in Education Funding</h3>
<p>After the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education sent the 1933 budget estimate booklet for provincial education funds to the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office on August 31st, the office stated that due to years of deficits and the provincial treasury's nominal but not actual contributions, coupled with an increase in recurring expenses of 380,000 yuan and temporary expenses of 88,000 yuan this year, it was unable to proceed. It immediately sent a letter to the Department of Education explaining the reasons, requesting a discussion with the Education Funds Committee, and returning the budget booklet. As a result, on September 9th, the Auditing Committee did not issue funds because the budget was not confirmed and there was no booklet to reference. The office sent a section chief to the Department of Education to explain the difficult situation and the Chairman of the Provincial and County Funds of the Department of Education sent a letter stating that the Department proposed temporarily suspending payment of 350,000 yuan of the temporary expenses and 50,000 yuan of the recurring expenses, totaling 400,000 yuan, to be reserved for budgetary flexibility. Because the office did not specify which expenses were to be temporarily suspended, the Department of Education sent an official letter on September 12th. The auditors then stamped the provincial school's July fund issuance notification, which is now in the treasury. Recently, due to clearing the July expenses for the Rural Teachers' School and the Experimental Primary School, the remaining funds were very low. It is now urging various counties to pay their contributions. It is estimated that the issuance of notifications for provincial schools in July (Rural Teachers' School and Experimental Primary School in August) and the receipt of actual funds by the schools will occur around the Mid-Autumn Festival on the old calendar. The following is an excerpt of the correspondence between the Education Funds Management Office and the Department of Education:</p>
<p>Letter from the Management Office to the Department of Education (Excerpt): Regarding the receipt of your letter sending the 1933 provincial education fund budget estimate booklet for reference. Also, regarding the budget booklet, the part concerning temporary expenses, except for a portion that is urgently needed and must be issued in advance, the remainder is marked to be left for the second term, to be approved and allocated based on the state of the year's revenue, amounting to approximately 400,000 yuan, etc. We deeply sympathize with the Department's efforts to develop education. If funds are ample or income matches expenditures, there is no room for discussion. However, due to years of accumulated deficits, as of the end of August this year, there are approximately 600,000 yuan in recurring expenses for more than two months of the previous year that should be paid, over 250,000 yuan in issued but unpaid temporary expense notifications and supplementary equipment expenses, 220,000 yuan in bank loans to be repaid, and 150,000 yuan in Tuya pledges, totaling over 1.2 million yuan. The treasury is empty; how can we cope? If there is no planned increase in revenue, and then a sudden increase in a large amount of expenditure, the old debts will be impossible to repay, and the new ones will be even harder to handle. The accumulation of deficits will inevitably deepen, and the future is unimaginable. We are considering reserving approximately 400,000 yuan of temporary expenses and allocating them based on the state of the year's revenue, as a reflection of the Department's intentions to balance both economic and educational undertakings. We admire your foresight. However, our office's revenue from three special taxes is at most 3.8 million yuan in a prosperous year. Due to frequent natural disasters and banditry in recent years, the revenue is often insufficient, resulting in large accumulated deficits. The recurring expenses for this year, totaling nearly 3.6 million yuan, plus the temporary expenses that must be issued in advance, have already accounted for the highest amount in a prosperous year. This can be accurately estimated without needing to wait and see the state of the year's revenue. Moreover, the accumulated deficit is over 1.2 million yuan, and only 140,000 yuan is listed for offsetting it, which seems insufficient. Also, the designated rectification of the Tuya taxes revenue, based on past experience, seems entirely unreliable. Other expenses, such as loan interest, severance pay and pensions for teachers and staff, are all paid from the reserve fund, which also cannot be avoided. Therefore, we believe that the budget proposal needs to be considered. Instead of delaying problems to the future, it is better to be cautious at the beginning. We propose that the Department of Education re-audit the budget, reduce or postpone any items that have not been reviewed and approved by the Education Funds Committee and other projects that are not urgently needed, and designate and earmark a definite amount of over 400,000 yuan to leave as a reserve for offsetting accumulated deficits, so as to provide working capital and avoid danger. In short, our office and the Department of Education are in the same boat and have a mutual responsibility to maintain each other. If we know the danger but cannot truthfully state it and leave room for further discussion, it will ultimately lead to the bankruptcy of education funds and the mutual distress of both parties. What will happen then? Therefore, we do not hesitate to offer our sincere advice and hope that you will understand our difficulties and carefully consider and reply.</p>
<p>Letter from the Department of Education to the Education Funds Office (Excerpt): Regarding your previous letter instructing us to rewrite the 1933 budget, making sure to live within our means to avoid virtual income and actual expenditure, etc. We have sent a letter to inform you of the process of revising the budget for this year by the sub-department for your review. When preparing the detailed budget this time, we also proposed approximately 400,000 yuan of temporary expenses, stating that they would be temporarily suspended to leave room for flexibility. The budget allocation has already been reviewed and decided by the Education Funds Committee. In order to respect the authority of the Committee, the Department cannot unilaterally change the amount stipulated in the outline before the meeting makes a decision. The aforementioned temporarily suspended amount was originally intended to not be allocated temporarily and to be submitted to the Education Funds Committee for review and decision. The temporary expenses listed in the budget include 393,000 yuan for general education and 60,000 yuan for social education, totaling 453,000 yuan. Of this amount, except for a certain [omitted] 53,000 yuan and approximately 50,000 yuan that are urgently needed and must be allocated, the remaining 350,000 yuan are intended to be temporarily suspended. In addition, 50,000 yuan [omitted] from the temporary expenses is also intended to be temporarily suspended, totaling 400,000 yuan. All of this will be formally proposed at the next meeting of the Education Funds Committee, requesting the Committee to decide not to issue it and to designate it to offset accumulated deficits. This is the Department's original plan, which does not seem to differ much from the opinions expressed in your letter. We are hereby replying to your letter for your information.</p>
<h3>Local News: County Education Bureau Orders Schools to Quickly Organize Boy Scout Troops</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau issued an order to all schools yesterday, stating: "We have received a letter from the Shanghai County Executive Committee, which states that the China Boy Scout Council has forwarded an order from the China Boy Scout Headquarters, requiring all Boy Scout troop members, service personnel, and Boy Scouts to undergo a second registration in order to unify the organization and serve as a preliminary preparation for the future national grand review. The registration deadline is set for September." It is noted that the Guangci Orphanage and Zhuanqiao Elementary School in this county have already been organized but have not yet completed the second registration. This Bureau has already ordered them to complete the registration. Other schools that have not yet been organized should be instructed to quickly organize and register with the Bureau within the deadline, so that the Boy Scout organization can become widespread and school training can be perfected. Therefore, the aforementioned order is hereby communicated. You are hereby ordered to organize and register as soon as possible. This order is issued."</p>

<h3>The September 18th Incident and Clothing - Tian Xiao</h3>
<p>Clothing is the First of Life's Essentials (clothing, food, housing, and transportation)</p>
<p>Love of Country Begins with Clothing</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident is now two years old. During these two years, the Northeast Volunteer Army has struggled valiantly to resist Japan, gradually failing. The signing of the Tanggu Truce has caused heartache to our entire nation. After the fall of Shenyang, the people of the whole country engaged in a boycott of Japanese goods, but what is the effect today? Therefore, we should change our approach and first strengthen our own economic power. First, we should no longer allow money to flow to foreign countries and should use domestic goods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Of the necessities of life - clothing, food, housing, and transportation - clothing is the most important. Therefore, our use of domestic goods should start with clothing, which would put us on the right track. Whether it is cloth, silk, wool, or serge, there are excellent domestic products available (for example, the various silks and satins produced by the Mayer Silk Weaving Factory are superior to imported goods), and the prices are lower than those of foreign goods. So why bother using foreign goods?</p>
<p>We need not shy away from saying that everyone's spirit has cooled considerably this year. We don't often hear the slogan "Promote domestic goods" anymore. But the September 18th Incident, which is etched in our minds and which we cannot forget for a moment, has stared us in the face, alarmingly, as we have been tearing off the calendar pages. If we still don't use domestic goods, and insist on buying foreign goods for our clothing and daily necessities, then all the money will go to foreign countries, and perhaps in the future we will be too poor to even afford clothes.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Clothing - Hengping</h3>
<p>The evolution of clothing is actually the progress of human thought about clothing. Primitive people wore animal skins, wrapped themselves in leaves, and wore grass skirts. What they wore was mostly natural material. These were primitive clothes. After civilization began, people learned to use silk, hemp, cotton, or other plant fibers to weave silk and cloth. However, dyes were still made from natural materials, such as gallnuts, pagoda tree flowers, and indigo. As culture progressed, people realized the relationship between hygiene and appearance, and woolen goods became popular. Furthermore, after the invention of chemical dyes, color combinations became complex and durable. People's clothing varies according to the four seasons, the weather, the time of day, and various occasions. In short, the evolution of clothing is directly proportional to the evolution of humanity.</p>
<p>The properties of clothing can be discussed from three aspects: form, color, and quality. In terms of color, barbarians generally like red and bright colors. It is said that the aborigines of Taiwan and the Miao and Yao people of Yunnan and Guangxi like to trade for red cloth with Han merchants. But in today's cities, except for a few women who dress extravagantly, very few people like to wear bright red. As a result, woolen goods have become popular and have become a suitable material for modern clothing. Their colors are not bright red or bright green, but rather intermediate and composite colors that are more subdued.</p>
<p>In terms of form, the countries of the world are gradually converging. The clothing of Chinese people, except for a portion who have completely switched to Western suits, is generally becoming more Europeanized in the cities and among those who follow trends. In recent years, women's fashions have tended towards the expression of curves and unique patterns. Since the form of clothing has been Europeanized, the raw materials must naturally be suitable for Europeanization. Therefore, foreign woolen goods have invaded the Chinese market and sales have been increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of quality, woolen goods are naturally the best material for making clothes. They have a loose texture, which can contain a lot of air and is not easily affected by sudden external cold or heat. The fibers are elastic, so the appearance is straight when worn, and even when creased, they do not shrink much. The colors are also lustrous and natural. Therefore, they have an elegant and noble appearance, which is considered a desirable quality and is loved by society.</p>
<p>The evolution of clothing into internationalization has changed the colors of Chinese clothing. The change in the colors of Chinese clothing has made the country a terminal point for the heavy sales of foreign woolen goods. This is an extremely serious change. Looking back at the market in the past, foreign cotton textiles have invaded China and have been extracting a lot of money year by year, and this trend is intensifying, causing China to suffer from national anemia. If, in the future, the economic aggression of foreigners gradually shifts to woolen goods, or if cotton cloth and rayon come together, what will be our economic burden? I believe that this requires industrialists to prepare quickly and the people to support and encourage them, because it is difficult to reverse the preferences of people and the shifting of trends. Therefore, we must quickly manufacture woolen goods and strive for excellence every day. On the one hand, the people must develop the habit of taking pride in using domestic goods. For example, there are several woolen factories in Shanghai these days, but they mostly only produce knitted goods. Among them, the Zhanghua Woolen Factory is the largest in scale and the most technically skilled and can produce fine serge, valencia, and overcoating. Its products are gradually catching up with imports, and the prices are also lower. However, in the face of the dumping of foreign goods and in a year of recession, the struggle of domestic industries is extremely difficult. If industry cannot get support from the government, we, the people, must automatically rise up to support it. The Japanese have a habit of always putting Japanese goods first. They only use foreign goods if Japan does not have them. The Chinese also have a habit of putting foreign goods first, thinking that foreign goods are always better than domestic ones. If we can break this superstition and participate in a bit of national salvation and self-help, we will surely discover some domestic goods that are truly excellent. Thinking about the modernization of clothing, I am reminded of the efforts of the Zhanghua Factory, so I am happy to introduce it here.</p>
<h3>Trying on Clothes by Wen Zi</h3>
<p>When Chinese women have clothes made, there have always been only eight measurements: (1) body length, (2) arm length, (3) shoulder width, (4) waist size, (5) hem circumference, (6) cuff size, (7) collar circumference, and (8) collar height. Recently, two more have been added: (1) bust and (2) abdominal circumference. This is because after the emancipation of the breasts, the pursuit of beautiful curves has led to the division of the chest, waist, and abdomen into three different measurements.</p>
<p>However, old-fashioned tailors, after taking measurements and cutting the fabric, still don't send a draft of the garment for a fitting. Western-style clothing stores, on the other hand, require a fitting before they sew the clothes.</p>
<p>Especially for silk garments, a fitting is essential. Because silk is soft and drapes downwards, if even one measurement is slightly inaccurate, the appearance will be diminished. For example, the newly released "22 Autumn Style Ru Man Crepe" from the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory is the most fashionable fabric. If we choose a favorite pattern and take it to the tailor, wouldn't it be a shame if it wasn't fitted and sewn well?</p>

<h3>Reflections on the September 18th Incident: Silk and the Rural Economy by Yuan Shuang</h3>
<p>Chinese Women Wearing Domestically Produced Silk Can Support Tens of Millions of Farmers</p>
<p>Some say: "Now that the rural economy is bankrupt and the lives of people across the country are so difficult, we shouldn't promote extravagant clothing!" This argument is very reasonable, and we seem unable to refute it. But have we actually gone to the countryside to see what the national sericulture situation is like? If you knew for sure that farmers were irreparably losing money on silkworm rearing and were uprooting their mulberry fields, and if you knew for sure that domestically produced silk was meeting resistance everywhere abroad and that domestic buyers were mostly wearing rayon and Eastern fabrics, you would not object to our advocating for more attractive clothing made from domestically produced fabrics.</p>
<p>We can also see very clearly that women's consumption is higher than men's. Their clothing expenses are always more than double those of men each year. But because they don't know which fabrics are foreign and which are domestic, they often mistakenly buy foreign goods. We only ask them to spend this huge amount of money within our country. We are not actually telling them to increase their spending. Instead, they might even save some money (because domestic fabrics are generally cheaper). Therefore, we should advocate for this even more and guide them in choosing the right fabrics and tailoring them in a way that is both fashionable and aesthetically pleasing, which is especially welcome.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, a part of our national territory has changed color, and much money and property have been seized by the Japanese. This is a huge loss that everyone knows. But if we narrow our focus to clothing, domestically produced silk shipped to the Northeast is not only subjected to heavy taxes by the puppet regime, but also Japanese goods have long pushed our domestic silk to the point where it has no place to stand. At the same time, Japanese fabrics are dumped across our country. As long as we go to the market, we can see Japanese fabrics everywhere. In this serious situation, shouldn't we use domestic goods?</p>
<p>Women's fabrics are naturally best suited for silk, but</p>
<p>(Three Patterns of 22 Autumn Style Fabric)</p>
<p>(Four Patterns of 22 Autumn Style Fabric)</p>
<p>Women often have a problem that is difficult to solve: they are willing to use domestically produced silk, but they must also consider the fashion of the patterns. Although the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory often has various new products that meet the needs of the general public, we still feel that other silk factories have not been able to achieve the same large-scale production as Mei Ya, and we also feel that women have not fully adopted domestically produced silk, which is a pity.</p>
<p>If women across the country could use domestically produced silk when making silk clothes, then China's sericulture industry would be revived, and the tens of millions of farmers who rely on sericulture for a living could also have their livelihoods secured. In other words, if Chinese women wear domestically produced silk clothes, tens of millions of farmers can live.</p>
<h3>The Color Matching of Modern Women's Clothing (Continued) by Yi Xiang</h3>
<p>▲Brown: Belongs to the Red Family</p>
<p>Brown is slightly darker than maroon and has less yellow. Its appearance is deeply muted, like an older adult among humans. Therefore, its color matching should be light and vibrant, taking advantage of the contrast between old and young.</p>
<p>(Matching Colors) Orange-Red, Orange-Yellow, Ginger-Yellow</p>
<p>▲Yellow: Main Color</p>
<p>Yellow is a bright and vibrant color and also occupies a prominent position among colors, being bright yet elegant, radiant yet pure. When used to make clothes, it exudes a kind of dignified aura that no other color can match. Therefore, women of high status all like to wear it. Color matching should be with colors that harmonize with yellow, such as dark yellow. If matched with other colors inappropriately, it can easily detract from its beauty. Here are some colors that are suitable for matching. (Matching Colors) Silver, Black, White (To be continued)</p>

<h3>September 18th Temporary Market by Qiang Hua</h3>
<p>Last year (September 18th), Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, Zhang Hua Woolen Company, and nine other domestic goods factories, in commemoration of the (September 18th Incident), set up a temporary market on Nanjing Road, selling all their products at discounted prices, causing quite a stir.</p>
<p>This year (September 18th) has arrived again! Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory and Zhang Hua Woolen Company, together with Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a total of nine domestic goods factories, are opening a temporary nine-factory domestic goods market at the Saint George Dancing Hall on Jing'an Temple Road starting today. They are selling various domestic goods at discounted prices. Mei Ya's "22 Autumn Style Ru Man Crepe" was sold at discounted prices for eight days during the fashion show at Sincere Company, but due to the crowds, many were unable to purchase it. Therefore, in addition to selling other novel silks at the September 18th temporary market, it is said that "22 Autumn Style Ru Man Crepe" will still be sold at the Sincere Company price, starting at 40 cents per foot for single width and 80 cents per foot for double width. Zhang Hua Company has a type of (September 18th) serge, which is better in quality than imported products, and is also being sold at discounted prices at the temporary market to remind all sectors to commemorate the (September 18th Incident). The fabrics woven by Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory also have very good patterns and very bright colors, surpassing imported products. The Saint George Dancing Hall is next to Jing'an Temple, making transportation very convenient, especially for those living in the western part of Shanghai or the Caojiadu area. It opens today and will be open all day every day.</p>

<h3>The Vertical Lines on Pants by Zhao Junhao</h3>
<p>I have been wearing Western suits for twelve years without realizing it. I am truly ashamed! Except for a few spun silk long gowns in the summer, almost all Chinese clothes have been completely eliminated. After the September 18th Incident two years ago, I made the biggest decision to switch to Chinese clothing. But in reality, I couldn't add much at once, and the Western suits I had made before couldn't be "consigned to the flames". I also knew that domestically produced wool was available on the market, but according to friends who had worn it, "the biggest drawback of domestically produced wool is that it lacks resilience. People who wear Western suits know two essential elements: first, the style must be well-made, and second, it must be ironed smoothly, especially the two vertical lines on the pants. Domestically produced wool lacks resilience. No matter how good the style is, it doesn't fit well. The two vertical lines on the pants are completely out of the question, but there are two curved lines instead."</p>
<p>This idea lingered in my mind, and I really had no way to find a solution to the clothing problem. I could only wear old Western clothes every day, preparing to become a grease-stained Russian. Later, my old friend Sun Jundaosheng gave me a Zhang Hua discount coupon, repeatedly urging me to break my preconceived notions and guaranteeing with his personal integrity that if Zhang Hua wool was not good, he would be willing to "return foreign goods" on my behalf. Of course, I didn't want to continue being grease-stained, so since my friend was so enthusiastic, I had to learn from Hu Shi and put into practice what he called "success from ancient times lies in trying."</p>
<p>Stepping into the Zhang Hua retail department downstairs at the Mainland Commercial Building, my joyful mood broke through my ashamed emotions. On the shelves and tables, wasn't everything displayed domestically produced wool? Color, texture, resilience, were they even a little bit worse than foreign goods? Flannel, serge, tweed, Sportex, everything was available. I took out the discount coupon that Daosheng had given me and bought two suits' worth of domestically produced wool fabric at a very cheap price. I hurried to Qingchangtai on Baker Road and entrusted the old red-nosed tailor to cut it carefully, making sure to achieve "complete satisfaction." A week later, my new Western suit was on me! When my old friend Sun Enlin saw me wearing a new suit with black background and white lines, he first shouted "Ttiung is not bad", and then praised the fabric as generous, saying it must be English. "If it's not English, where can you find such a gentlemanly style?" I laughed for a long time, saying it was Zhang Hua domestically produced wool, and he still didn't believe it. Finally, I accompanied him to investigate it again for half a day before he walked out very satisfied.</p>
<p>I now have five suits of Zhang Hua wool clothes, and the two vertical lines on the pants have always been maintained, with no curved lines ever appearing.</p>

<h3>Do Not Forget (September 18th) by Ji Ping</h3>
<p>We Chinese people now seem to have developed a habit. Whenever we encounter a commemorative day, we hold a meeting, observe a moment of silence, give speeches, play music, and then adjourn, whether it's National Day or a day of national humiliation. After the meeting adjourns, everyone is as if nothing happened, taking things in stride. This kind of expression is like descendants carefully preparing offerings, reverently sacrificing to their ancestors on their death anniversaries, or covering their faces and weeping to express their remembrance. Once the day has passed, they forget it. Comparing this to that, there is simply no difference. Alas, compatriots, in the 365 days of the year, there is not a single day worth celebrating, and the painful commemorative days are increasing endlessly.</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident is an unprecedented memorial of lost territory, a memorial of the enemy cutting off our "lifeline". The people of the country, because of the great pain and suffering, once fought hard and vowed to recover the lost territory. The government also declared "long-term resistance and restoration of the territory". Now, only two years have passed, and it has all vanished like smoke, and the situation is completely different. The spirit of the people has declined, and the political situation is chaotic. Looking within the country, I can't bear to say it! If this continues, what will the situation be like in ten years? Alas, my Northeast, whose world will it be?</p>
<p>Looking at the international situation, it is clearly becoming more and more serious every day. A second world war, I'm afraid it's unavoidable. According to the predictions of fortune-tellers, it will break out in 1936. My dear compatriots, this is not superstitious alarmism. Just look at the countries building up their military forces, which can be taken as clear evidence. The newspaper often reports on a certain country building border defenses, a certain country building warships, a certain country holding air defense exercises... In short, their preparations for land, sea, and air forces are almost continuous day and night. Those of us with a little national awareness are really envious.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, in this period of serious national crisis, we have suffered years of enemy iron hooves, deeply feeling the pain of dismemberment. How should we unite as a country to wash away this strange shame? However, unexpectedly, everything cannot live up to the expectations of the people of the country. Once a major war breaks out suddenly and we are drawn into the vortex, how will we deal with it? On this second anniversary of the (September 18th Incident), we are just hoping that the ruling officials will show great mercy and seek a glimmer of hope for the country and the people!</p>
<h3>Are the Rivers and Mountains Safe? by Yong Zi</h3>
<p>Looking at the maps published by bookstores in China, they are still the same as before, listing the four northeastern provinces as part of our "territory." So, I suspect that I am dreaming. Could it be that we have indeed recovered the lost territory under the "non-resistance" policy? But when I accidentally saw a "Complete Map of the Great Japanese Empire," I couldn't help but be shocked. Again, I seemed to be dreaming, and at the same time, I suspected that I was seeing things or seeing ghosts. Let's not think about these for now, but (September 18th) has arrived again. The "September 18th," which lost territory, humiliated the country, and did not lose soldiers, has heartlessly arrived again. So, I proved that I am not dreaming. The four northeastern provinces have changed from a semi-colony to a de facto formal colony of the Great Japanese Empire.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the Blue Sky White Sun flag has been removed from the top of Changbai Mountain and the banks of the Songhua River and replaced with magic banners. It is only natural that the people of the Northeast under the iron heel wear a smile through tears every day and say that they are enjoying themselves while being whipped. And even more so today, this (September 18th Anniversary), it goes without saying that brand-new magic banners are planted all over the four northeastern provinces, and it is only natural that every person in the Northeast will be forced to wet their throats with tears and shout three times, "(Long live the Great Manchurian Republic, long live the Great Japanese Empire)." We can even imagine the joy and excitement of the Japanese government and people today, celebrating this memorial day of expanding their colony.</p>
<p>Everything that cannot be asked about is ruthlessly reflected and acted out in a scene-by-scene, vivid and colorful way, which really makes people a little unsure whether they are dreaming or awake. Because the utterly unreasonable (September 18th) is already its second anniversary. Since there is a (September 18th), but we open our eyes and see an atmosphere of peace and prosperity, it seems that the scene in the Northeast is all a dream. But the death knell is ringing, and various places are holding (September 18th) commemorations, so the (September 18th) is undoubtedly a confirmed fact. But who is planning to recover the lost territory? This is clearly still dreaming.</p>
<p>This is truly an unbreakable riddle. The green hills and clear waters outside Shanhaiguan may still be squatting and flowing. Everyone, hurry up and put your heads on the pillow. Perhaps someone will bring you good news in your sleep. (Are the rivers and mountains safe?)</p>

<p>Gui Zhi said: "You're carrying such a big bag of things, where are you coming from? Please come to my house and sit down." Mother Liu raised the string of large and small paper bags she was carrying and looked at them. She laughed to herself, as if there were countless things inside that had to be said. So, she nodded a few times to Jiang and said, "Okay, that's just how I am. I like to find two people who I can talk to and chat." As she spoke, without waiting for Jiang to lead the way, she had already walked towards the gate. Jiang led her to the room and sat on the kang. After busying herself with tea and cigarettes, she asked, "Mother Liu, you're carrying such a big bag and a small bag. Are you coming back from the city?" Mother Liu looked at the things placed on the kang and laughed again. She said, "No, I just passed by the entrance of the Gan family's house, and that Mrs. Gan saw me and insisted on calling me in..." She only got this far when Jiang looked at Gui Zhi's face, which already had some red tide on it. At this moment, she couldn't help but feel uneasy for a while. No matter what, the words she wanted to say in her heart couldn't follow what she was saying. So, she stopped her and said, "Don't mention him. That family is snobbish." Although Jiang only said this one sentence, there were naturally many unspoken secrets beneath it. How could Mother Liu know this bellyful of difficult scriptures? In her moment of triumph, she still continued, "That Mrs. Gan is quite nice. Her family has a lot of rough work to do (Note: Referring to sewing and making shoes). She always looks for me to do it. She pays quite a bit. Yesterday, she had guests and had leftover pastries, melon seeds, and peanuts. She said that if she kept these things, they would probably spoil, so she shared some with me to eat. I didn't want to eat them, but where have the children eaten such good pastries? So, I didn't stand on ceremony and brought these back, big bag and small bag." Gui Zhi now hated the Gan family to the core. Not only did she not want anyone to say good things about the Gan family, but she also didn't want to hear anyone mention the Gan character of the Gan family. (190)</p>
<h3>Is (September 18th) Over? by Jie Lu</h3>
<p>Without looking at the map of our country's territory, we forgetful Chinese people have forgotten the national shame of (September 18th)! Although maybe a few friends remember, it is difficult to be moved and saddened without looking at the map of the territory. After (September 18th), wasn't there a big corner missing from the northeastern part of the autumn begonia leaf-like territory of our country? This part, with its delicate green color and fleshy leaves, was greedily swallowed by the invaders! Still looking on greedily, wanting to gradually nibble at other parts, isn't the national defense of (September 18th) heartbreaking?</p>
<p>Although our noble country has many national humiliation memorials, (September 18th) is certainly in the first place. No, maybe in the near future, there will be some outstanding national humiliation, and (September 18th) will have to take second place! There are many ways to commemorate (September 18th): dancing, watching movies, strolling around the amusement park, because entertainment can save the country. Wearing a black cloth on the sleeve, sighing a few grievances, holding meetings, and issuing leaflets, this is also the routine business of national defense commemoration.</p>
<p>(September 18th) and (January 28th) have passed for two years. The years of national crisis have long passed. Singing and dancing, drunkenly living in a dream, our noble country's people are born with a good eight characters, of course, they can enjoy the blessings of peace and stability. What (September 18th) and (January 28th) have long been thrown into the Eastern Ocean. Who knows that the people and rulers of the Eastern Ocean country have the heart of the man of Qi, saying: "After three more years, in the Western calendar 1936 or 1937, which is when they are Showa 11 or 12, the world war will definitely come." They have three hypothetical enemies: the United States, the Soviet Russia, and China. They call this year "(Year of National Crisis)". I think: The Japanese are very much like Xiang Yu of the Qin Dynasty in our country. They have never suffered a defeat. How majestic. But this Xiang Yu, before he reached Gaixia, already knew the danger of reaching Gaixia at that time. Are the Japanese paranoid? Are the Chinese numb? Maybe the Japanese believe in (human affairs) and the Chinese believe in (destiny). The Chinese have great measure and great fortune, and naturally have the protection of God. What world war, you can naturally rest easy. The Japanese are really mediocre and self-disturbing.</p>
<p>How are the Japanese mediocre and self-disturbing? I know that in their publishing industry, there are many, many works about the future world war, such as (Air Force Explosion), (Prediction of the Great War), etc., and more pamphlets are published than our (love novels)... Where do our great writers have the time to create these works? Japan's current military machinery factories are racing day and night to manufacture weapons, which must be completed before the war. They say: "(They are prepared to last at least three years after the start of the war: their economic capacity can also last six or seven years.)" We curse them that they will collapse soon, it's really a fool's dream.</p>
<p>Today is (September 18th), everyone should feel sad, but judging from the current situation, there is no preparation at all. When the world war breaks out in (1936), we can only wait to die. Alas! Our national crisis, is (September 18th) over?</p>

<h3>Understand Your Children by Pei Yu</h3>
<p>Children who suddenly wake up in the middle of the night (those who suffer from night terrors) should be treated with an understanding attitude. In most cases, it is due to digestive organs such as the stomach or intestines acting as an obstruction. Unless the methods of raising children and their diet are adequately checked and actively improved, good results are difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>For this reason, children should not be given large amounts of food after eating snacks at four or five in the afternoon. Bedtime is at six thirty and seven o'clock. A standard healthy child does not need to eat dinner. Many mothers think that milk and biscuits, or a thin slice of cake, bread, butter, and jam, etc., are somewhat beneficial and helpful for children who sleep through the long night without drinking or eating. In fact, this view is wrong. Too much food can damage digestion and lead to indigestion. Eating dinner after afternoon snacks is too much for children and they cannot digest so much food. Of course, stomach rebellions and night terrors are a normal result.</p>
<p>Another common cause of night terrors is adenoid swelling. The reason why a child suffers from night terrors due to adenoid swelling is that the air passage is blocked, so he cannot get the amount of oxygen needed to nourish the nerves or the nervous system. As a result, the nerve center suffers from starvation and toxins, and a stimulating situation is produced.</p>
<p>Sometimes night terrors are a symptom of disease, such as measles, scarlet fever, and even rheumatism. For this reason, although children who suffer from night terrors should be taught to be quiet and peaceful, a considerable degree of serious treatment is also essential.</p>
<p>When a neurasthenic child suffers from night terrors, giving him a dose of cod liver oil and malt every day has amazing effects and can help the nerve tissue and nerve center to strengthen. Regular meal times and amounts, regular sleep times, more fresh air, and reducing over-stimulation are all essential elements for raising a neurasthenic child who suffers from night terrors, and the food should contain large amounts of milk, eggs, and fish.</p>
<h3>Increasingly Growing Infants by Pei Yu</h3>
<p>One day, a young mother came to me, showing a very painful look, because her healthy one-year-old infant did not have the tendency to sit alone. A neighbor's infant, who was one month younger, could sit alone very naturally.</p>
<p>Many infants can sit alone very early, and some very late, which is not certain. Many infants grow faster than others, and their brains also grow faster, so they know what to do and do it. Other infants may have slight defects or weaknesses in their back muscles, and this problem can only be corrected with patience. Such infants should spend more time in the air and sunlight. Washing the back and legs with salt and water can make them strong and powerful, and a massage every morning can also help to eliminate this weakness.</p>
<p>Many infants grow very fast, or even too fast, and (naturally) cannot supply every part of them with what they need, so some places are inevitably weak. Infants with weak parts may be due to lack of exercise, which is not known. Exercise is very necessary for growth. If muscles and bones are not exercised, they will gradually weaken and completely lose their function. Exercise not only makes the muscles and bones move and use, but also makes breathing smooth, so that more oxygen can be inhaled.</p>
<p>The time of year when children can sit or walk is very important, and their abilities vary greatly. For example, if a child can sit or walk in the summer, then it is inevitably a small lag, because it is only afraid that it is beyond his physical strength. Growth is faster in spring and summer than in winter.</p>
<p>Or the food needs to be rich. Some infants gain weight after eating ordinary food, and some do not develop easily after eating special food. Adding a little cheese or prepared malt to the feed can have a wonderful effect. Measuring weight is also important for backward infants. From this method, it can be determined whether there is a problem with the actual growth of the infant.</p>

<h3>A Discussion on the Problem of Chinese and Western Medicine</h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>Since Mr. Jiao Yitang, a member of the Legislative Yuan, advocated for national medicine (Chinese medicine), the so-called problem of Chinese and Western medicine has become a topic of discussion among prominent figures. I admire Mr. Jiao's straightforward and forthright attitude, which prevents those who say one thing and mean another from sitting on the fence and watching from the sidelines. This is truly admirable. Among the central committee members, how few want to express what Mr. Jiao has said! Some are intimidated by the authority of science and cannot bring themselves to speak out; others consider the relationship of interests and do not bother to think about it. Therefore, although the issue of Chinese and Western medicine has been brewing for a long time, it has dragged on for five years and finally erupted one day. I am surprised that it did not erupt when the Physician Regulations were changed to Western Medicine Regulations. I am also surprised that the person who raised the issue was not the Director of the Department of Health, who announced his grand policy, but the Director of the National Medicine Hall, who seized the opportunity and eloquently stated: "When the Legislative Yuan passed the Western Medicine Regulations, the health authorities stated that they would soon propose the National Medicine Regulations, but these regulations have not yet been drafted." The eruption of this issue can be seen as a testament to Mr. Jiao's courage and initiative, while on the other hand, it can be seen as evidence of the health authorities' weakness and incompetence. I am concerned about this, so I have drafted this article to offer my humble suggestions.</p>
<p>In today's newspapers, those who have heatedly discussed this issue include Mr. Wang Jingwei, followed by Mr. Chen Guofu, followed by Mr. Jiao's letter to the people of the country, and finally, the criticisms of Mr. Jiao's remarks by various gentlemen. These arguments each have their merits and demerits. If I were to point out each one's rights and wrongs, it would go against the original intention of this article, so I will omit them. I believe that the root cause of the problem lies in the National Medicine Regulations, and the key to resolving the stalemate in the National Medicine Regulations lies in a comprehensive consideration of the issue of Chinese and Western medicine.</p>
<p>Looking at the twenty-six articles of the National Medicine Regulations proposed by the twenty-nine central committee members, and Mr. Jiao's four-thousand-word letter to the people of the country, they can be summarized in one sentence: Chinese medicine should exist in opposition to and coexistence with Western medicine. I have also summarized the arguments against Mr. Jiao from various parties in two sentences: old medicine is not scientific and does not conform to the world trend, so it should not be opposed to new medicine, and the National Medicine Hall is not an administrative organ and should not usurp political power. However, I believe that to solve the medical problem in our country, it is not as simple as that. We must calm our emotions, remove the sense of superiority and inferiority, broaden our thinking, comprehensively consider the political, social, and financial situation, thoroughly discuss academic, legislative, and administrative matters, and avoid any self-interest, desires for exploitation, or feelings of jealousy from confusing the issue. Only then can we reach a fair conclusion and achieve good results. Let us try to discuss it.</p>
<p>Those who discuss the issue of Chinese and Western medicine, or the issue of old and new medicine, invariably begin with the debate between non-science and science. Therefore, should we begin the discussion of Chinese and Western medicine from an academic perspective? As for the violation of science by old medicine, there are Yu's "Discussion on the Spiritual Pivot and Simple Questions" as the vanguard, and other short articles and miscellaneous records that cannot be listed one by one. Even the first article of the organizational regulations of the Central National Medicine Hall, which states "adopting scientific methods to organize Chinese medicine," implicitly recognizes that Yin-Yang, Five Elements, and Six Qi are non-scientific. However, those old doctors often make sophistical defenses, trying to show off their writing skills to sell their techniques. I do not want to blame them, like frogs in a well or insects in summer. What I regret is that Mr. Jiao, in order to promote the idea of opposition and coexistence, does not hesitate to drag in a variety of arguments and exaggerate them, even distorting the meaning of the four words "practical experience" to force it upon himself, claiming that he does not value theory. This is to completely erase the medical books of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, which debated the merits of warming and tonifying or clearing and cooling. Alas, how biased and far-fetched! Therefore, to say that old medicine is close to science and can exist in opposition to and coexistence with new medicine is not only a clumsy argument but also a false statement.</p>
<p>However, the inability of medicine to stand in opposition is one thing, and the permissibility of doctors to coexist is another. To say that old medicine is inferior and should be eliminated is a narrow view that focuses on academics and ignores other political and financial considerations. Although there are no detailed statistics to prove whether ephedra is effective for treating asthma or whether angelica is effective for regulating menstruation, or whether they are appropriate, the majority of people who are destitute, displaced, and without recourse are content to have these ambiguous, unproven remedies to ease their suffering in bed. Zhuangzi once said that a man from Song took hats to Yue, but the people of Yue cut their hair and tattooed their bodies and had no use for them. With today's economic exhaustion and incompetent officials, the people of the country have already cut their hair and tattooed their bodies and become like the people of Yue. Even if there are hats, they cannot be used. Members of the Legislative Yuan who speak for the people should base their arguments on the reality of the political, social, and financial situation, and should hold the government accountable for its ambiguous handling of the issue of Chinese and Western medicine, and should advocate for the temporary continuation of old medicine for the people. Who can criticize this? This is one way to use public sentiment to break the academic debate. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Jiao Yitang's Letter to the People on the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "As for the abundance of drugs, it can be seen in the herbal compendia. The 'Shen Nong's Herbal Classic' exhibits the most prominent color in the practical experience of national medicine. Each and every one has been tried by people before being recorded. Western doctors consider them to be grass roots and tree bark, not worth a glance. How do they know that the effective components for treating diseases are in the grass roots and tree bark?" When I read this high-minded argument, I really wanted to laugh. The herbal compendia are compilations of various single prescriptions from various places. The single prescriptions are passed down by local people and are all matters discovered by human instinct, like what Tao Hongjing said, "Lotus root skin disperses blood, originating from cooks, morning glory seeds drain water, recently discovered by old farmers." Doctors of national medicine use herbal compendia, but they are only using matters discovered by human instinct. Even barbarians can do it. What is there to be surprised about? According to Mr. Jiao, it is as if your national doctors first established practical experience and then tried the grass roots and tree bark one by one before completing the herbal compendium. To put it simply, it is as if the herbal compendium was produced from the practical experience of national medicine. That is cleverly said, but it is only like the manipulative trickery of the monkey keeper who gives four chestnuts in the morning and three in the evening. If we explore it from the perspective of reason, I am afraid it cannot stand on its feet, right?</p>
<p>Also, regarding the words "How do they know that the effective components for treating diseases are in the grass roots and tree bark?" who is the "How do they know" being said to? I know that your national doctors use grass roots and tree bark and never talk about components, only talk about color, aroma, and taste, and the timing of sprouting, stemming, flowering, and fruiting to distinguish ascending and descending, floating and sinking, cold, heat, warm, and cool. To be more mysterious, they also say that it belongs to metal or wood, and enters the lung or liver. The classics of national medicine are all there. Who are you trying to deceive? Cinchona bark contains quinine. Ephedra contains ephedrine. Medicinal plants contain various plant alkaloids. Who "knows" it, the national doctors or the Western doctors? It seems to be getting more and more confusing, right? Let's talk about grass roots and tree bark again. Western doctors have never considered them worthless or ignored them. Please, Mr. Jiao, go and take a look at foreign medical schools. They cherish grass roots and tree bark. I am afraid you will be speechless. Even some universities in China have collected quite a few. Your national doctors teach students without really looking at the drugs. Western doctors use microscopes to examine various objects, but national doctors have never given them a glance.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao says that Western medicine has few drugs, while national medicine has abundant drugs. At first, I wondered how abundant it could be, but it turns out he is talking about the herbal compendia. According to the "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," there are only 360 kinds. Adding the "Famous Doctors' Records," there are only 720 kinds. Adding the "Grand View Herbal," there are only more than 1,500 kinds. Adding the "Compendium of Materia Medica," there are only more than 1,800 kinds. Adding the "Zhao's Supplement," there are only about 2,000 kinds. Now, the new drugs of scientific medicine are at least no less than 2,000 kinds. Adding the so-called old drugs of scientific medicine, the total is over 3,000 kinds. Who is rich and who is poor can be seen at a glance. I also ask Mr. Jiao to compare how many books on drugs there are in China and how many books on drugs there are abroad. Moreover, the covers of the herbal compendia contain things like human flesh, pubic hair, broken fans, and bald writing brushes, which are ridiculously funny. They are also considered drugs. Mr. Jiao is exaggerating a bit too much.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "Looking at what Premier Sun Yat-sen said in 'Psychological Reconstruction': In the past, Westerners saw Chinese people eating things like blood, liver, and intestines and considered it very barbaric. In order to maintain their own civilization, they disdained to eat these kinds of things. Later, somehow, they discovered that animal blood, liver, and intestines definitely have the effect of tonifying people's blood, liver, and intestines. Some people even use animal blood, liver, and intestines to treat diseases and specially established a name for it, called organ therapy. They learned our organ therapy like this, and they learned our grass roots and tree bark therapy like this. They will imitate Chinese medicine, using ephedra to treat asthma, rhubarb to promote bowel movements, angelica to regulate menstruation, and artemisia capillaris to treat jaundice. Westerners adopt one kind of thing from Chinese medicine, and domestic Western doctors also adopt one kind of thing from Western medicine. Domestic Western doctors spare no effort to make a big detour, following Westerners step by step, and national psychology disappears completely. Speaking of it, it is heartbreaking." This is Mr. Jiao's lecture on Premier Sun Yat-sen's theory, and also the instructions of the chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee. But Premier Sun Yat-sen used diet to prove that knowing is difficult and doing is easy, and solemnly said to the people of the country: "China's modern civilization and evolution, everything is behind others, but the progress of diet is still unmatched by civilized countries." Do you remember this passage, Mr. Jiao? It can be seen that tofu and animal blood are all things related to diet, and only in this aspect are we not behind others. In other words, the only things that are not behind others are limited to diet. Mr. Jiao violated the word "only" and extended it to medicine, which is not the purpose of Premier Sun Yat-sen's words. If Mr. Jiao wants to give a lecture on Premier Sun Yat-sen's theory to instruct the people of the country, it is best to fully understand all of Premier Sun Yat-sen's theories and remarks before speaking! Do not take things out of context and use Premier Sun Yat-sen's theories to confuse the people! As for making a big detour and following Westerners step by step, this is something that cannot be helped. They are advancing with scientific methods, and we are preserving with non-scientific methods. They are moving forward towards one goal, and we are hesitating in two directions. Straying from the path will not lead to success, and doubting matters will not lead to achievement. Naturally, everything is behind others. Gunpowder and cannons were invented by us Chinese, but now we are behind in all military weapons. I am not afraid that you will not make a big detour and follow step by step. The compass was invented by China, but from the compass to magnetism, and from magnetism to electricity, they are striving to be first in everything. You cannot help but make a big detour and follow step by step. The same is true in medicine. There is no lack of research talent and inventive minds in the country, but unfortunately, in this environment, heroes have no place to use their talents, and a clever woman cannot cook without rice. If the government does not promote it and society does not recognize it, there is no such thing as windfall falling from the sky. Mr. Jiao, do not be mistaken! If you do not want to follow others, you must catch up! Premier Sun Yat-sen's intention is for us to learn the latest from them. For example, they used coal power in the past, but now they use electricity. If we want to learn from them, we should directly learn to use electricity. Please refer to Premier Sun Yat-sen's sixth lecture on nationalism. He did not teach the people of the country to use the old method of drilling wood to make fire to measure the length of electricity, and he did not teach the people of the country to use a separate boiler to cook rice to resist electricity. The same is true for medicine. We must use their latest theories, latest tools, and latest methods to research so that we can compete with them on an equal footing, or perhaps even surpass them. If we use grass roots and tree bark, adhering to the traditional habits of a thousand years, this is the behavior of "sleeping and not striving" that Premier Sun Yat-sen spoke of. It is not even enough to be "following him from behind," so how can we talk about "catching up from the front"?</p>
<p>Premier Sun Yat-sen's psychological reconstruction of the nation is to say that we Chinese should learn foreign science, not to prohibit Chinese from learning foreign science, laugh at Chinese for learning foreign science, or be heartbroken by Chinese for learning foreign science. "Airplanes that fly into the sky, Chinese people can all learn them. What else is difficult to learn?" These words encourage us to learn their science and do not say that our old things, which are behind in everything, are better than foreign things. In terms of medicine, it is to encourage us to learn scientific medicine, to use their latest invented theories, instruments, and methods to research scientific medicine, and we will definitely be able to compete with them on an equal footing. It does not say that using grass roots and tree bark is better than them. Premier Sun Yat-sen is progressive and revolutionary. Mr. Jiao should not distort Premier Sun Yat-sen's words to be a guardian of conservatism and regress. Premier Sun Yat-sen desperately guides us and encourages us to learn science to consolidate the realization of his nationalism. Now we are following Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings to catch up with medicine, which is in the natural sciences, but Mr. Jiao says that we have lost our national psychology. Alas! It is not a pity that we are being falsely accused. I am afraid that if Premier Sun Yat-sen knew, he would be pounding his chest and crying bitterly, not just being heartbroken!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "If we can slightly downplay the business aspect and truly research each other from an academic perspective, I believe that in thirty years, we may not be able to form a new medicine of the Chinese nation and lead the world's medicine on a new path." Mr. Jiao repeatedly recognizes the academic revolution of medicine as a business dispute. He is deliberately slandering us. I have already stated it. Please show evidence that it is not an academic discussion. Speaking of business, both Western doctors who keep their mouths shut and national doctors who have always been silent have food to eat. They are not limited to snatching other people's jobs to have food to eat. Furthermore, if you really want to have a full rice bowl and a good business, Western or national doctors only need to use ambiguous strategies and talk about some nonsensical arguments to suit the current social psychology. This is the best way to prosper your business. Why say more and create animosity on both sides? Even I would never use such a bad strategy if I wanted to develop my business. Therefore, my attack on national medicine is entirely from an academic perspective and may even sacrifice my business. My attitude has already been stated in the preface to my book "On the Revolution of Medicine," and I will excerpt a passage below.</p>
<p>"One, it is not to take away the rice bowls of old doctors, but to criticize old doctors, to awaken old doctors, to try to reason with old doctors, to transform old doctors, to eliminate old doctors... I am not boasting. If I were to put up a sign as a Chinese medicine doctor, I am afraid I could become a rare and famous Chinese medicine doctor in Shanghai, perhaps even the first-class Chinese medicine doctor in Shanghai... If I were thinking about my rice bowl, I only need to play some tricks, be a fence-sitter, a cross-party member, and have a gray attitude to muddle through. My business would definitely be more prosperous than it is now. Even if I destroyed the rice bowls of old doctors, I am afraid that the old doctors would still come to be close to me. Why draw swords and stretch bows, only digging at the pain and bad habits of old doctors?"</p>
<p>Please, Mr. Jiao and the people of the country, think calmly. We are attacking national medicine because we value the academic aspect too much and the party affairs aspect too little.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Medicine and Pharmacy in Shanghai in the Last Ten Years</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Medical and Pharmaceutical Education and Publications. Section 2: Old Medical and Pharmaceutical Education</p>
<p>In ancient times, both Chinese and foreign countries considered medicine and pharmacy as one subject. However, our country still retains this ancient practice. There was no specific educational institution in ancient times. Generally, private tutoring and clinical explanations were considered the only way. Fortunately, people were sincere and simple at that time. Teaching children was definitely meticulous and authentic, and writing books and establishing theories also had successors in each generation. There were many authors in the Han and Jin dynasties, and they were repeatedly added to in later generations. It is a pity that the research methods violated the principles of "experiment and statistics." Therefore, the theories could not be organized, so that the authors thought they were right, and the readers wandered under the saying, "It is better to have no books than to believe everything in books." This is the great reason why Chinese medicine and pharmacy have no value. It is also the general mechanism for the conflict between new and old theories. During the Tang Dynasty, students were taught in the Imperial Medical Office and divided into five departments: body therapy, sores and swellings, pediatrics, eyes and ears, mouth and teeth, and horn therapy. During the Song Dynasty, the Imperial Medical Bureau had nine departments with as many as 300 students. Every year, they had to take examinations in six subjects, such as written meanings, pulse, meanings, and prescriptions. During the Yuan Dynasty, 13 departments of medicine were established. They were tested every three years, and they were tested on medical classics, discriminating medicines, and combined tests of classics and books. The Ming Dynasty was the same as the Yuan Dynasty, but the examination method was stricter. The Ministry of Rites held a joint examination and distinguished grades. During the Qing Dynasty, teaching halls were established. Those who taught medicine to eunuchs were called "inner teachers," and those who taught the children of medical officials were called "outer teachers." The examination of medical officers and doctors was conducted by the officials of the Imperial Hospital, who set questions on the Suwen, Difficult Classics, Herbal Compendium, and Pulse Secrets. (The above text refers to Li's book on Medical Education in Various Countries). Looking at the situation of the past dynasties mentioned above, it can be seen that China has never paid attention to medical and pharmaceutical education for the people. Examining medicine and teaching medicine were all under the control of the emperors, which undoubtedly contained aristocratic and feudal characteristics. However, readers should know the previous history before seeing what recent old medical education is like. Comparing the two, I am afraid that even those who believe in old medicine will be disappointed in the future of old medicine.</p>
<p>By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the teaching halls had long since disappeared. Therefore, old medicine and pharmacy throughout the country, from the aristocracy to the common people, could be said to be uniformly under the private tutoring system. Ten years ago, old medicine was stimulated by the new trends, and several Chinese medicine schools were established in various places. Shanghai, taking the lead in the trend, was naturally the first to establish one. The curriculum of the Chinese medicine school included some scientific subjects such as physiology and anatomy, thus gaining the superficial knowledge of new medicine. Two kinds of people emerged from this. Those with more scientific concepts felt that the theories they held were too unfounded and therefore abandoned old medicine and worshiped new medicine. Unfortunately, the fundamental academic skills were delayed by time (this can be proved by a letter from a certain Chinese medicine doctor to Yu Yunxiu of the Social Medical Journal). Students without scientific concepts were naturally confused by metaphysical theories. However, they all used the superficial knowledge of the simplest Western medicine theories to attack Western medicine. There are many such nonsense writings on the market now. Jiao Yitang said in his letter to the people, "Young national doctors have not failed to take the strengths of new medicine." He probably meant these people. In my many years in Shanghai, I have actually met a Yu Yunxiu who read hundreds of volumes of Chinese medicine books and refuted old medicine, but I have not yet seen a single old doctor who has read dozens of volumes of new medicine books and refuted new medicine. This shows that the more Chinese medicine books you read, the more you see that they are far from the facts, and the more Western medicine books you read, the less there is to refute. As for the society, because the students of Chinese medicine schools are not traditional disciples of a certain master, there is some customary distrust. Students of Chinese medicine schools also feel that new Chinese medicine is not liked by the oldest people and not recognized by the oldest and most qualified old doctors. They also feel that the skills learned in Chinese medicine schools do not have the mystery of the tutoring method. Moreover, the Ministry of Education does not allow Chinese medicine schools to be included in the school system. Those who run Chinese medicine schools also feel that there is a danger of rebellion by recruiting middle school students to study metaphysics. Due to these various reasons, Chinese medicine schools have changed from being fashionable for a while to being silent. The education of old medicine has returned to the old path of tutoring. Now, let us first put forward the so-called disciples under the tutoring system. Under the current trend, although education is not universal, it is probably increasingly difficult to find Confucian scholars who close their doors at home and specialize in reading the Four Books and Five Classics. Junior high school graduates, with just passable Chinese, want to run to high school. Even if they do not go to high school to study, but learn Chinese medicine, they have already received training in natural science, which is somewhat incompatible. Therefore, it is conceivable that the apprentices who are willing to learn old medicine are people who have failed to learn both writing and swordsmanship. Secondly, let us discuss the time of the tutoring system. Even if there are Confucian scholars from old families or junior high school graduates who want to take shortcuts to earn a living and learn old medicine, frankly speaking, their Chinese level is not enough to read ancient books, and they must worship a famous doctor as their teacher in order to seek the shortcut among shortcuts. I ask, is it possible for those busy and semi-working apprentices to have this very busy famous teacher start by teaching them Chinese, and then comprehensively teach them the Spiritual Pivot, Simple Questions, Difficult Classics, Treatise on Cold Damage, Pulse Secrets, Herbal Compendium, and clinical lectures, all in a limited time to make money? Moreover, what is the teacher's own level of Chinese? This is also a major issue. Thirdly, let us discuss the methods of the tutoring system. In recent tutoring systems, because the above-mentioned qualifications and time cannot be resolved, they abandon reading books and glorify it by saying that they only rely on experience. The teachers with a light career have simply no experience to gain. Following a popular teacher only involves writing pulse records and prescribing medicine, and never learning any diagnosis. Because students have no basis for learning, they have to pay attention to the teacher's superficial responses to patients and work hard on the words of absolution at the end of the teacher's pulse records. But these are places that must be understood with the heart. Therefore, when the teacher and student jointly diagnose a disease, they can only be mysterious, magical, and secretive. What roots can be found in the theories?</p>
<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p>This product, without the peel removed, is a light yellow capsule, slightly spherical, slightly flattened on the top and bottom, with a smooth surface, three straight blunt ridges, and three obvious longitudinal grooves. The inside is divided into three chambers, each containing about ten to thirteen seeds. The seeds are extremely irregular in shape, brown on the outside, with fine and dense mesh, a slight odor, a spicy and burning taste with turpentine oiliness, and quite palatable.</p>
<h3>Composition</h3>
<p>This product is rich in fat and volatile oil, reaching about 10%.</p>
<h3>Efficacy</h3>
<p>This product is used as a stomachic, detoxifying agent, and aromatic.</p>
<p>(Appendix Old Theories) Pungent and hot, fragrant and dispersing, strengthens the spleen, warms the stomach, breaks up qi, dries dampness, removes cold, eliminates phlegm, promotes digestion, dispels miasma, cold malaria, objective cold, stomach pain, cholera, dysentery, dysphagia, acid reflux, fullness, sour vomiting, phlegm retention, accumulation, brain cold, toothache, alcohol poisoning, fish and meat poisoning. Excessive doses help spleen heat, deplete qi, damage the eyes. The elderly and weak should use with caution. The Compendium of Materia Medica says: "Galangal and caoguo are the same thing, but there are slight differences. The caoguo produced in Jianning is as large as a dragon's eye, but slightly longer in shape. Its peel is yellowish-white, thin, and sharp. Its kernel is like amomum villosum, but spicy, fragrant, and harmonious in qi. The caoguo produced in Yunnan and Guangdong is long and large like a chebula, its peel is black, thick, and densely ridged, and its kernel is coarse, spicy, and stinky, just like the odor of a Spanish fly."</p>
<p>It also says that the herbal classics consider galangal and caoguo to be the same thing, but Shizhen distinguishes them by the shape of the product and the real thing. The Complete Herbal Classic considers them to be two things. However, when discussing the shape of the flowers and leaves, it only mentions galangal and does not mention caoguo. Could it be that they originally belong to the same thing, but their seeds and fruits are different due to the land? Since the seeds and fruits are different, the qi and taste are also different in harmony and intensity. The indications are different and should not be mixed. Caoguo has an outer peel, while galangal has exposed kernels, as if without an outer peel.</p>
<h3>The Government Should Quickly Stop the Illegal Actions of the National Medical Institute</h3>
<p>— Xun Chu</p>
<p>Generally, since the establishment of the National Medical Institute, the old physicians have greatly desired to emulate the warlords in seizing territory and acting domineeringly. This publication has previously written articles sternly criticizing their absurd delusions. However, few have come forward to expose the facts and clarify matters to society. This is the humble purpose of this article. Upon investigation, Article 1 of the Organizational Regulations of the Central National Medical Institute clearly stipulates that (the purpose is to adopt scientific methods to reorganize Chinese medicine and improve treatment and pharmaceutical methods). However, the institute, in its arrogance, presumptuously claims to be an old medical administrative organ, issuing orders like a government office, severing the administrative system, seizing government authority, disrupting health administration, and hindering the evolution of medicine. For example, the Xinhui County branch of the institute in Guangdong Province even caused a major uproar last December by forcibly registering doctors and pharmacies (see the second issue of the branch's gazette). Furthermore, the Shanghai branch, in April of this year, clashed with the old medical community in Shanghai over the collection of prescription fees, with the focus of the dispute being the assertion that the institute is definitely not a medical administrative organ (see the special publication on the Shanghai Three Old Medical Associations' prescription case). In addition, the Zhejiang Provincial branch recently secretly requested the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to order various county governments to grant it full authority over the administration of old medicine (see the August 17th Zhejiang News). The second step involves issuing National Medical Certificates and pharmacy licenses, establishing special chapters, and collecting various certificate fees, gradually creating the impression that it shares power with government agencies. According to the Executive Yuan meeting, the review of the National Medical Regulations, based on the replies from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior, considered the National Medical Institute to be an academic organization, not an administrative organ, and requested the Central Political Committee to investigate and take note (according to various reports). Therefore, all the institute's actions and measures have exceeded its position and authority, and are clearly illegal. Moreover, the institute has been established for three years, wasting more than ten thousand yuan of national funds (calculated at five thousand yuan per month), with no results and repeated disputes. Even if the government does not immediately abolish it, it should order strict restraint and avoid indulgence and recklessness, lest it cause shame to medical administration. It is hoped that those in power will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Attention to the Poor and Sick</p>
<h3>Shanghai Physicians Association Notice Regarding the Donation of Consultation Vouchers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Physicians Association, for the purpose of assisting the poor and sick, has specially printed consultation vouchers. The association has hired members from various districts to voluntarily provide medical services. Anyone who is poor and unable to afford medical treatment can obtain vouchers from the association at No. 41, Aivenyi Road, Chihang Road, Shanghai (no vouchers will be given out on Sundays). The association will provide consultation vouchers to nearby physicians. Each person is limited to one voucher per visit (group requests are not subject to this rule). The voucher can be used to go directly for treatment, without any charge. (For mail requests, please attach two cents for postage; blank letters will not be sent.)</p>
<p>News: Mr. Yan Shanrong, a Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, has been serving in the new pharmaceutical industry for many years. Recently, recognizing that the leakage of profits from the rubber plaster product alone amounts to millions of yuan each year, in order to recover the rights and interests, he has specially gathered funds to establish the China Rubber Plaster Manufacturing Factory on Gaota Road. After a year and a half of research and supervision, it has finally been successfully produced. It is named "Anchor Brand" rubber plaster. The trademark pattern has been registered with the Ministry of Industry. This plaster is hygienic, sterile, has strong adhesion, does not irritate the skin, prevents pus formation, eliminates bacteria, and promotes wound closure and muscle growth. It is comparable to imported products. Major pharmacies in this city have it for sale.

<h3>The Philosophy of Taking a Step Back</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>The patience of us Chinese people is truly excellent. If someone punches us, we endure it. If someone kicks us, we also endure it. We accept adversity and submit to it. We can endure anything. This is indeed where our spiritual civilization surpasses others. The reason why our culture has continued uninterrupted for four thousand years to this day is largely due to this patience. Anything can be put off from today to tomorrow, and tomorrow there will be another tomorrow. This approach has been delayed for four thousand years, and has been endured for four thousand years, and it can undoubtedly continue to be delayed and endured.</p>
<p>Moreover, when patience can no longer continue, we still have the method of taking a step back. This philosophy of taking a step back is actually more clever and reasonable than endurance. Endurance roughly aligns with the maxim of being content with what one has and finding joy in it. It stands in a position of neither advancing nor retreating, while taking a step back clearly involves a certain action. This is why it is clever and aligns with maxims such as turning big problems into small ones, turning small problems into nothing, and even the idea that having one less problem is better than having one more. Endurance ultimately requires a bit of conservative maintenance, while taking a step back is very labor-saving. This is reasonable because proceeding in the direction of least resistance is the absolute truth in the universe.</p>
<p>The meaning of the philosophy of taking a step back is best and most vividly expressed in the two phrases: "When advancing feels like every inch is difficult, taking a step back feels like the sea and sky are wide open." The benefit of taking a step back lies in being able to see a wide-open sea and sky. Others ride fine horses, while I alone ride a donkey. This is the benefit of being able to think of taking a step back. Moreover, taking a step back is something everyone can do. Apprentices and employees in shops and factories who have something to eat are one step ahead of the unemployed who can't find anything to eat. The unemployed workers and peasants are still stronger than beggars. Beggars can still think that they are better off than famine victims who starve to death. Famine victims who starve to death can still think that they are better off than ghosts who are unjustly killed for no reason. Therefore, taking a step back can be said to have no end, which means the sea and sky are wide open. Those who are dissatisfied with the status quo have their path forward blocked by thinking of taking a step back because taking a step back only teaches you to retreat. Backing up is its specialty. Since advancing feels like every inch is difficult, what are you waiting for if you don't back up? Therefore, aspiring young people who encounter difficulties in advancing, after being influenced by this philosophy, are backing up one after another, and the world is at peace.</p>
<p>The philosophy of taking a step back is developed because it captures the essence of laziness. Chinese people are the most greedy for ease and comfort, and love to lie down on a high pillow and enjoy the fruits of others' labor. However, when they cannot enjoy it while sitting, they inevitably find it difficult to settle down and establish their lives. Therefore, the philosophy of taking a step back is indispensable. Only with this can they continue to be lazy and implement the great way of not working and reaping rewards and governing by doing nothing. Therefore, the philosophy of taking a step back is the secret of spiritual victory. From this, we can see that retreating from Liaoning to Jinzhou, retreating from Jinzhou to Guannei, and retreating from Shuhe, and our army's safe retreat, are another kind of anti-Japanese victory. There is no doubt that this philosophy of taking a step back will promote the realization of world harmony because all struggles can be eliminated invisibly. Not only can international disputes be eliminated, but also class antagonisms can be resolved. People of insight should come together to promote this philosophy so that everyone in the world will embrace it. Then the world will truly be at peace, and the spiritual civilization of the East will shine upon the four seas.</p>
<h3>A Bibliomaniac's Talk</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>Li Rihua's (Purple Peach Studio Miscellany) and (Further Miscellany), I have seen three versions of them. One is a Ming woodblock print, a set of ten volumes including (Six Research Studio Notes), (Painting Dowry), and (Continued Painting Dowry), etc., but missing one volume of (Miscellany). The bookseller asked for 200 yuan, which I obviously could not afford. The second is the (Zui Li Series) edition in small book format. The third is a photolithographic edition with annotations by Jiang Xinyu. This edition is missing Volume 3 of (Further Miscellany). Among them, the Jiang edition is the most interesting. The annotations are exactly like a tutor correcting a student's homework, making people laugh and also making them imagine the interesting expressions of this old man when reading and his attitude towards Ming Dynasty writers. Some of these annotations are very reasonable, but some are too demanding. I will excerpt a few here to make the reader think about the madness of this innocent bibliomaniac:</p>
<p>This argument is ridiculous. Why bother with such trivialities? Ming people read books without studying the strokes of the characters, but read them without understanding. The character (zhe) is incomprehensible. There is no such sentence structure. Probably Mr. has never seen the Tang dynasty reference books such as (Elementary Learning Records) and (Classified Literary Works). This paragraph should not be kept, it is an insult to famous scholars. Completely unread. Neither Tang nor Song, there is no such poetic style. It is known that Mr. is completely ignorant of this matter. It seems that your Excellency has not read (Notes on the Zasaos). Why copy such ignorance? This man's knowledge of poetry is extremely shallow, and he is particularly incompatible with Du Youge. Reckless words. In fact, your Excellency has never seen his back. Fabricated words are hateful. Not daring to say Cheng-Zhu, not rid of Ming people's habits. This is the text of (Records of Examination of Craftsmen), why copy it? It can be seen that Ming people do not read books. Again, I don't know from which book this was copied. If I knew it was the Zhou Rites, I wouldn't have copied it. Inconsistent and illogical. Ming people write books with such incomprehension. This is due to the emptiness of the people of the Ming Dynasty. Has your Excellency ever seen his book? Mr., I think you don't keep reference books at home. Ridiculous. Forced interpretations are hateful. (Bing) and (Qiu) are completely different. Where did this absurd talk come from? This is evidence that Ming people do not understand character learning. According to (Gui Xin Miscellany), Song people already didn't understand.</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>I don't know when, I copied a section from Xie Zhaozhe's (Sea of Literature and Sand of Waves) about (Book Collecting), saying that the love of a bibliomaniac for books is truly meticulous. The rest of this section reads:</p>
<p>Ancient people cherished books, and the collections in their homes were all fine. Lord Ye's ivory tags numbered 30,000, as new as if they had never been touched by hand. Xie Hua's books, he collated and proofread himself, arranged in twenty kitchens. Shen Lin hand-wrote small books filling dozens of baskets. Lu Guimeng recorded as soon as he got a book. Although he collected little, all were exquisite and worthy of transmission, not just boasting of quantity. However, not many (books) were ultimately lost to the hands of sons and soldiers. Therefore, Du Jin wrote in the postscript of his books: (Please write by paying salary and proofread myself, so that descendants will know the holy teachings when they read it. Selling or lending it to others is unfilial.) Chen Ya wrote in his poem: (The room is filled with books, miscellaneous classics and graves, Huating immortal guest, Dai Yun root. If you hadn't sold them with flowers at that time, you would have been a good descendant of my family). The worries of the two gentlemen are profound. However, unfilial descendants waste property like wind sweeping away husks. Even with ten thousand words of earnest advice, how can one prevent them from selling them? But it is better to sell them to a connoisseur who appreciates them and cherishes them for me than to have them eaten by mice and stained by sparrows on the shelves of a rogue.) Zhao Wenmin wrote in the postscript of his books: (Collecting and viewing books is not an easy task. When viewing books, clean the desk and burn incense, clear your mind and quiet your thoughts, do not roll the pages, do not fold the corners, do not use clips to prick them, do not use them as pillows, do not use your nails to invade the characters, do not peel the pages while sleeping, repair them as you touch them, close them as you open them. Those who obtain my books later, please accept this method as a gift.) These words are supreme. It can be said that this is an unparalleled sincerity, the Bao Shu of classics.</p>
<p>Although this passage inevitably has some pedantic and laughable points, the ancients' love for books was mad, and their deep concerns about books can be said to have exhausted their minds.</p>
<h3>Gods, Tigers, Dogs</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Seven years ago, which wasn't very long ago, the newspapers in Nanchang were discussing the issue of (Leather Belts and Love). The heroic revolutionary cause encountered obstacles at the beauty pass. (The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard.) Everyone felt that at that time it was not appropriate to be (lovesick and weaken one's heroic spirit). From our perspective seven years later, that was not a very long time ago, but to ignite the hearts of all the beauties in the world and make them bow down before the leather belt seems like a very, very distant, bygone era. The January 28th Incident once briefly showed such fervent emotions in the Suzhou area. But compared with the mentality of the National Revolutionary Army in the Nanchang-Wuhan era, where it was glorious to walk alongside revolutionary soldiers, it was still a notch below. Seeing someone wearing a leather belt brings another kind of concept to mind: something seen on trains, ships, in theaters, and restaurants. Although one wouldn't dare to say it out loud, that's what one would think in one's heart, the so-called (exchanging glances). I think those wearing leather belts must also have a (feeling of being in a bygone era).</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about current affairs now, I just want to talk about these kinds of things from ancient times. For example, the separatist rule of the Tang Dynasty vassal lords is recorded at length in every historical book, along with a few curse-filled annotations. In fact, they also suffered some injustice. The Tang Dynasty's early military system used the fubing system of the Later Zhou Dynasty. The so-called (fubing), to use a current revolutionary term, is (military force and the people are united, military force becomes the people's force). The people were registered as soldiers, and the brave and capable men were selected and trained by the prefects during agricultural off-seasons, forming one hundred prefectures. They usually lived in the countryside and went out to fight when there was something to do. After the war, they still returned to their hometowns. At that time, these forces did not belong to any one person. Whenever there was a conquest, the government would appoint a general at any time. After the war was over, the soldiers returned to their prefectures, and the generals handed over their seals. Therefore, there was no one who possessed soldiers. In theory, this is quite ideal. However, the corruption of the Tang Dynasty's military system did not begin with the rebellion of the vassal lords after the Tianbao era. In the early Tang Dynasty, there were already (Yucong Imperial Guards) among the patriarchs. There were 10,000 men who were all dragon-conquering warriors who followed Emperor Gaozu in the Taiyuan Uprising. After unification, they were willing to stay in the palace and follow the dragon to the end. Therefore, they were given (northern idle fields) and guarded their livelihoods for generations. Later, the so-called left and right (Shenwu Army), the so-called (Iron Horse), and the so-called Yulin Army all came from these imperial guards. Before the Tianbao era, at least the government could command these imperial guards. After the Tianbao era, Emperor Daizong of Tang ordered Yu Chaoen to lead the Shence Army. The imperial court entrusted the military force to the eunuchs. Since then, political orders came from the eunuchs, and the emperor's deposition and establishment and the prime minister's administration all had to obey the eunuchs. Therefore, the corruption of the Tang Dynasty's military system first began with the imperial guards. The corruption of politics also first began with the transfer of military power in the Shence Army and should not be included in the accounts of the vassal lords. The emergence of the vassal lords has a considerable relationship with the invasion of foreign bandits. Because the fubing who took turns guarding the capital (called fanshang) became a showy decoration during the reign of Emperor Gaozong and Emperor Zhongzong of Tang. At the beginning of the Tianbao era of Xuanzong, they felt the seriousness of foreign troubles. Therefore, ten jiedushi and jinglueshi were stationed along the border. Those dudu who held the festival were originally also temporary commanders. It wasn't until after the Anshi Rebellion that the meritorious generals who suppressed the rebels and the rebel generals who came to surrender were all invited to be jiedushi. Only then did the situation of separatist rule by the vassal lords begin. The virtues of the vassal lords are needless to say. They controlled local administration, and their sons inherited their positions. The jiedushi fought each other, causing the people to be poor and the wealth to be exhausted. But it must be said that the crime of the vassal lords wielding troops was greater than that of the eunuchs holding the imperial guards. Even Ouyang Xiu was unwilling to say so.</p>
<p>An ancient saying says: Removing (a certain thing) is like fire, if it is not contained, it will burn itself. When the so-called famous generals Guo Ziyi and Li Guangbi led the imperial guards mightily to kill (something) in the western capital, the official army totaled 150,000, of which the Uighur army was only 4,000. It was necessary to have these 4,000 Uighur troops to recover the western capital. Isn't it a miracle? Later, in the Battle of Xiangzhou, there were a total of 600,000 imperial guards and fubing. It cannot be said that there were not many, but they were defeated by Shi Siming's 30,000 soldiers. The most amazing thing is that Huang Chao ascended and called out, and the poor peasants rose up in droves, rampaging for tens of thousands of miles north and south, as if they were in an uninhabited land. They almost went straight into Tongguan, threatening the capital. If Li Keyong had not brought the Shatuo Tartar soldiers to come to the aid, Huang Chao would have already established his capital in Chang'an. Originally, it was a little painted face roaring like thunder, but suddenly he played the role of a clown on the corner of the stage to perform comedy. Not only did the audience laugh, but the actor himself also felt a little funny. At the end of the Five Dynasties, the vassal lord martial drama was nearing its end. Both Southern Tang and Later Shu had a tendency to stop fighting and cultivate culture. Zhao Kuangyin, who seized the throne as a martial artist, also wanted to ask Zhao Pu to govern the world with half of the Analects. The cup of wine released the imperial guard Shi Shouxin, and the soldier Bing of the vassal lord Wang Yanchao. The dream of martial force was finally awakened.</p>
<p>Recently, I had a pleasant conversation about world affairs with a friend who had been in the military for a long time. He said with emotion: (Our (industry) is about to dawn!) After hearing his words, I thought of another warrior 丨 who had shed blood for others 丨 and his (Gods, Tigers, Dogs). Will the heroes of the age of knights really appear in the typical form of Mr. Jihede?</p>
<h3>Shallow Lake (8)</h3>
<p>— Written by Joseph Conrad, translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>Assad continued speaking in a flatter and lower tone.</p>
<p>(We arrived at a small bay near the land that seemed to block our way, a long sea (something). We pushed the boat onto the white sandy beach. This long sea (something) stretched far into the sea. My brother knew the place. On the side of the sea (something), there was a river mouth, and a narrow road ran through the grasses of that sea (something). We lit a fire and cooked some rice. Then we slept on the soft sand, hidden in the shadow of the boat, while she was watching. I hadn't closed my eyes when I heard her exclaim. We jumped up. The sun, already half tilted in the sky, from the entrance of the bay we saw a sailboat carrying many sailors. We immediately understood; it was our chieftain's sailboat. They were looking at the shore and then saw us. They beat the gong and turned the neck of the sailboat into the bay. I felt the heart in my chest weaken. Dia Meilun sat on the sand, covering her face with her hands. There was no way to escape from the sea. My brother laughed. When you left, Tu An, you gave him a gun. He was holding it, but there was very little gunpowder. He quickly said to me: (Run with her along this path. I can cover you because they don't have guns, and facing someone who goes ashore with a gun in hand, they are sure to die. Run quickly with her. On the other side of the forest, there is a fisherman's house and a small boat. When I run out of all the gunpowder, I will follow you immediately. I run very fast, and before they catch up, we can escape. I can hold on as long as I can, because she is a woman, who can't run or fight, but in her weak hands she holds your heart.) He bent behind the boat. The sailboat arrived. She and I ran. As we dashed forward along the path, I heard gunshots. Our brother fired, once, twice, and then the gunshots stopped. Silence remained behind us. This sea (something) was narrow. Before I heard my brother fire a third shot, I saw the sloping beach, and I saw the water again: the mouth of a large river. We crossed a meadow in the forest. We ran into the water. I saw a low hut on the black mud and a small boat tied up. Behind me, I heard another gunshot. I thought in my heart: (This is his last shot.) We rushed onto the boat; a man ran out of the hut, but I jumped on him, and we rolled together in the mud. When I stood up, he lay quietly at my feet. I don't know if I had already killed him. Dia Meilun and I pushed the boat away. I heard shouts behind me, and I saw my brother crossing the meadow in the forest. Many people followed him. I picked her up and threw her onto the boat, and then I jumped in myself. When I looked back again, my brother had fallen to the ground. He fell and got up again, but many people held onto him tightly. He shouted loudly, (I'm coming!) People followed him closely. I looked and there were many people. Then I looked at her. Tu An. I pushed the boat away! I pushed the boat into the deep water. She was kneeling at the bow, looking at me. Then I said, (Take your paddle.) As I paddled, Tu An, I heard him shouting. I heard him call my name twice; at the same time, I also heard the sounds of shouting like this: (Kill! Fight!) I never turned back. I heard him call my name sharply again, and at this time his voice and his life were quiet together 丨 but I never turned my head back. My own name! … My brother! He called me three times 丨 but it was not because I cherished my life. Wasn't she in that boat? With her, couldn't I find a piece of land where death is forgotten, where death is unknown!)</p>
<p>The white man sat up straight. Assad also stood up, and on the flames of the extinguished embers, a vague and silent figure was reflected. On the lake, the clouds and mist floated low, slowly disappearing the shadows of the sparkling stars and unfolding. Now a large expanse of misty white air covered the ground: it melted coldly in the darkness, silently forming whirlpools around the tree trunks, around the bamboo platform of the house, so that the house seemed to float on the restless and turbulent illusion of the sea. Only in the distance, on the starry sky, the treetops drew clear outlines, like a gloomy and inaccessible coast 丨 the coast of ruthless darkness.</p>
