<p>邇近梅雨連綿。各地水勢。繼續激漲。漢口水位巳漲至四十四尺一寸。較去年水位。高出一丈零九寸。即較之前年大水。亦高出五尺七寸。湘浙兩省。亦均水勢浩大。交通停頓本報前於本月十三日。曾發表預防水災二文。冀以大聲疾呼之籲請。喚起國人之注意。今則水勢逐日增高。危機亦逐日增大。迥想前年大地陸沉之慘情。顧今當前之危險。吾人誠爲之不寒而慄。矣</p>
<p>查近數年來水勢所以激增之故。實由於喜馬拉雅山積雪消融。雪水下注。長江游。旣無廣大森林。不足以蓄水。而梅雨連線。又足助其威勢。故沿江各地。水勢日漲。但若我人對於隄防工作。向有充分之準備。則此漸積之水。决不至於成災。前淸張之洞督兩湖時。即每年指定固定經費。作爲防水工程之需。但亦有名無實。直至近數年來。不僅地方政府於事前毫無準備。抑且挪用原有之水利經費。隄工廢弛。自可想見。夫江漢蕩。本爲民利。今旣不能充分發揮其能力以福國利民。而又不能妥爲布置以防其害。前年之巨創未復今歲之危機又見。滾滾江流。將爲禍水。則彼負有保護隄工之責者。實不能辭廢弛之咎也。</p>
<p>歷來處置水患不外三策一曰「消」即以科學之方法。根本消弭水患。是爲積極之建設次曰「防」即以人力防患於未發。是爲消極之抗禦。其最下策者乃爲「救」斯即所謂災象巳成大禍巳至而後起而從事於挽救。我國今日天災人禍。相洊而至舉國人民無日不在災禍迫害襲撃之下。「固無從談及而「防」與「救。」則爲今日急應雙管齊下而不可再緩。質言之。凡尙未成災之區。如長江下游各地。則迅速從事於防禦。其巳成災之區則趕籌善後政府當局應速組防災委員會。督促各地方政府與各負責機關。不准推諉。不許退縮。竭力合作。而全國慈善機關與富有者。亦應及茲災區尙未擴大。各盡其力之所能。以襄助進行。毌使大災成後。老弱轉徒。少壯流離。致重喪國家之元氣願我舉國朝野。集中力量。共起而負此最後之工作。</p>
<p>前年水災損失。總額達二十億元。其間接之損失。尤無可估計。吾人試閉目設想。事前如能以此造林。導淮濬江。築堤。固無事不舉即使一部分用之於建設。一部分能用之於有關消災之事業。亦斷不至成此數十年來未有之大災。徒以舉國上下。各諉其責。坐視水勢與日俱增。白浪挾巨刧以俱。來迨大災旣</p>
<p>成。夫然後組織賑濟機關。手忙脚亂。忽促救濟。而國計民生。巳蒙受無可補償之損失矣。此種巨刧。一巳爲甚。今猶創痍未復。寧容痛肉上再加利刀。我政府我國人。其速急起救人自救。蓋今巳臨到最後之危機矣。</p>

<h3 id="c123">本案辦理經過 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>麥根路站貨物裝卸、撤銷工人　　合作社、改交楊恒貞承辦經過、　　五月七日、揚恒貞正式請求承　　辦、十五日、陳承栻報告、調查　　楊恒貞情形、認爲適合、十六日、楊恒貞呈述承辦意見、六月二日、楊恒貞呈送聲請書、六日、陳承栻電告與中央黨部工人科接洽妥當、發楊恒貞承辦准許書、分函上海市社會局·公安局·保安處·通知撤銷合作社情由、令袁伯揚·謝文龍·陳承栻·監視接辦、七日、布告麥根路貨棧弉卸貨物、於六月七日起、交楊恒貞承辦通知合作社、自六月七日起撤消、函兩路特别黨部通知撤消經過、九日、呈報鐵道部備案、（事先巳口頭陳明部長及主管司長官）、</p>
<h3 id="c124">包工制之解釋 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>承辦裝卸鐵路貨物辦法爲鐵道部所定、中華民國鐵路貨車負責運輸辦事細則附件之第五種、於二二十一年十一月五日公布、是否卽包工制、其解釋之天雖放晴</p>
<h3 id="c125">江水仍在續漲中 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>昨爲四十五尺一寸！！武漢人心極度恐慌　　頃聞全國經濟委員會工程處所得江漢工程局來電報告、謂天巳放晴、江水仍繼續增漲、二十一日上午九時、水位爲四十五呎一時、水離江岸祇有尺餘、人心極度恐慌、現該會工程處巳加派吳時霖·湯尙私·兩工程師馳往武漢一帶、協助辦理防汛事宜、並派工程師陸超赴京出席防汛會議、商洽一切、至於武昌金口新壩冲决一節、聞金水本係多數湖沼會萃之所、近年以湖底日漸淤澱、地方人士、有堵口墾闢之議、前歲曾聲請救濟水災委員會補助麥糧、於金口建築土壩、去年大獲豐收、惟以該處究屬河槽舊址所築新壩、尙未堅實、更遇連日大雨、江水盛漲、内外水面相差十餘尺、壓力過巨、以致下陷而决口、</p>
<p>權、不在本局、惟包工制常使包工享過大的利</p>
<p>益、而工人受過甚的剝削、今部定承辦鐵路貨物裝卸辦法、對於承辦人及脚夫（卽工人）的權利義務、有明確之規定、都受鐵路當局嚴密的指揮監督、巳與包工制不同、而最重要的一點、更在承辦人最多只能於規定裝卸費中提取百分之十、作爲本人的酬金及承辦的開支、故承辦人决不能像包工制之下、實行剝削工人、卽如麥根路站貨物裝卸費、現在規定每噸銀二角、承辦人只能得二分、工人應得一角八分承辦人却不能剝削、</p>
<h3 id="c126">合作社之撤銷 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>麥根路站貨物裝卸工人合作社　　試辦四年、成績、成績不佳、所以根據　　批准該社試辦章程第二十六條　　、「該社倘不能遵照章程、違犯　　規則時、本局隨時將該社撤銷、另招工人裝卸」之規定、將該社撤銷、</p>
<h3 id="c127">招人承辦理由 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>鐵路裝卸貨物、有四個方式、㈠　　由路方承認工人、自行組織合　　作社辦理、㈡由路方自僱工人　　辦理、㈢由路方招人承辦、㈣由　　託運商人自理、第一方式、事實很　辦好、第四方式、於路方貨商　不很方便、第二第三兩方式、鐵道部都有規定辦法、其中第二方式是最好、但不易辦、麥根路合作社、旣急需撤銷、而目僱工人、非有相當籌備、不能實現、故暫用第三方式、交由楊恒責承辦、蓋按照鐵道部承辦鐵路貨物裝卸辦法、固有根據、而如南京及江邊站等貨物裝卸、亦係由承辦人辦理、</p>
<h3 id="c128">兩種利益比較 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>合作社雖規定利益歸之工人全　　體、而開支也歸之工人全體、但　　利益（卽裝卸費）有規定、開支　　却無規定、故主持合作社之領　　班、倘有侵漁情事、工人不但不　　知、且無力干涉、領班便是包工頭、而不人便受其剝削、要使歸承辦人管理、則一切開支都歸承辦人負担、工人無責任、而裝卸費分配、却有規定、卽如麥根路站貨物裝卸費、在合作社辦理時、規定爲每噸銀一角八分、因合作社開支、都要從這一角八分内扣除、所以工人實際所得、不到一角八分、在承辦人辦理時、因規定每噸銀兩角、而承辦人限制只能取百分之十、一切開支、和工人無關、故工人可凈得一角八分、事實上、反比合作社辦理時爲有利、且裝卸還是原有合作社工人、并且原來每噸裝卸費一角八分、還要去掉開支、現在是可以實得一角八分從前因合作社辦得很壞、以致貨商幾於絕跡、收人减少、生活艱難、今後承辦人辦得好、貨運增多、收人增多、生活還可寛裕、現在交接雖没有辦妥、工人仍令照常工作、只是從六月七日起的裝卸費、路方照中央黨部派來調查本案的工人科李人祝、指示辦示、暫由站長直接發給、而合作社領班竟不許工人接受、到六月二十日才由李君會同鐵道部郭中興監視、由路局直接發給、</p>
<h3 id="c129">工人不受影響 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>承辦人不支薪、却要開支、而鐵道部領佈承辦人裝卸鐵路貨物辦法規定、承辦人至多祇能在裝卸費中抽取百分之十、又規定不能在裝卸費外、再向貨商有所需索、假定仍在原來一角八分中抽取、則只有一分八釐、而工人收入、只剩一角六分二釐、故路局改定爲每噸二角、使其可抽得二分、足敷其開支、不必額外向貨商需索、而在工人、却仍得一角八分、比在合作社時並没有减少、在貨商看似多出了每噸二分裝卸費、</p>
<p>但其他没有限制的陋費、一律免除、也没有吃虧</p>
<h3 id="c130">未曾武力壓迫 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>路局在令合作社撤消和令楊恒　　貞接辦時、僅派總務處副處長　　袁伯楊、車務處副處長謝文龍、　　京滬路車務段長陳承栻·三員　　監督、恐雙方萬一衝突、令駐路　　警察署預爲防範、上海市公安局·保安處預得本局通知、一同酌派警隊防範、並不是用以壓迫該合作社工人、保護楊恒貞接辦、所以當時合作社領班、旣提出反對包工制、拒絕交替、局方亦暫不强制楊恒貞去接辦、</p>
<h3 id="c131">還有一點說明 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>除以上數項外、最後還有一點　　須說明的、便是裝卸鐵路貨物、　　有下列幾方面的關係、㈠鐵路　　本身的營業、㈡托運貨商的營　　業、㈢工人的生活、㈣　社會的經濟、然從經營鐵路的立場上看、鐵路和貨商的關係、是直接的、工人的關係、還是間接的、社會的關係、却都是前幾種關係的結果、所以解决這一件事、應先得顧到貨商和鐵路而又兼及工人、那</p>
<p>末社會經濟也包括在其中了、</p>

<p>申報叢書</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌之解剖提要　　陸桂祥譯　全書八八頁　　紙面三十二開本實價二角五分　　世界經濟，陷於恐慌之　濘中，迄今巳近四年。在此四年中，全世界之紛擾不安，爲前此所未有。各國統治者，奔走呼籲，用盡方法，以謀解救，然終因其本身種種之矛盾不能消滅，結果乃無一收效。相反的，恐慌之進行，只有愈陷愈深。現在世界經濟會議又在開會了。然而資本主義的内在矛盾早巳註定了它底歷史命運，經濟會議之召集要不過爲最後之掙扎，那裏會有什麽好的結果呢；目前擺在我們眼前的問題，是將來的世界，將往那裏走，此一問題，我們應該加以嚴密的注意。尤其是我們落後的中國，其前途將爲如何，其與世界經濟之關聯如何，我們尤其應該加意研究。本書卽爲應此一需要而譯。其立塲，雖說是資本主義的，對於問題的觀察，多少有點不正確，但大體尙稱公允。而且我們研究每一問題，本不能偏於一面，於基本理論外，關於其他正反各方面的見解，是應該兼容並包，然後比較得失，才能抽出一個正確的結論，那末關於資產階級經濟學者對於目前經濟恐慌的觀察與見解，我們極應加以理會，而本書正是其一部代表作品。本書作者保爾恩齊Ｄｒ·ＰａｕｌＥｉｎｚｉｎｇ氏，爲當世有名經濟學者，著作如林，此書亦爲其最近得意名作之一。此書於一九二九年出版，未及三年，再版己三次，風行歐美，其價値可知。内共分四章叙述。第一章緒言。第二章，恐慌成因，内分十四節，將所有經濟學者對於恐慌成因之見解，悉數臚列，一一論述其得失。第三章，出路。論述今後世界經濟之出路，又分六節，詳論經濟恐慌各方面之解救方法。第四章，將來展望，爲全書結論。目前世界經濟恐慌，究竟怎樣去解救呢，最後他是歸着於世界應密切合作，以挽救資本主義之危亡。關於這點，他有詳細叙述，字裏行間，似乎前途很有希望。究竟有没有希望？他所主張的資本主義的合作，事實上有没有可能？我們靜看事實罷。然而無論如何，本書就其本身之立場而論，確是一本極有價値的讀物，尤其在這世界經濟會議正在開會的當兒，要研究世界經濟會議，此書極夠參考。至於章節淸疎，譯文淺顯，讀去絕無沉悶苦澀之弊。</p>

<p>— 周黎民</p>
<p>丨十年來的中國國際貿易丨</p>
<p>無論那個民族，總喜歡購買祖國的貨物，以示其愛國。那怕祖國出產的貨物最惡劣些，蹩脚些；總强辯的說是怎樣的佳，怎樣的美，好像和「癩痢頭的兒子戴花」一樣！</p>
<p>可是中華民族大不其然，適與外人成反比例：非衣西裝，吃大菜，居洋房，坐汽車，家用什物，都是洋貨，不足顯其闊綽丨就以平民來說，也是洋氣十足，如洋火，洋油，洋燈，洋爐，洋襪，洋傘·····無一而非洋丨這究竟是甚麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>意思是簡單的，手工業的國貨，墨守古代遺下的陳法，不求改進，無科學的頭腦，老是這樣的勞什字！洋貨能利用器機，製造敏捷，時刻地改造着！不</p>
<p>斷地革新着！那末「不進則退」的國貨，那能及其萬一呢！國貨又安得不一落</p>
<p>千丈萬里呢丨今將近十年來中國國際貿易的槪况，約略地列表如下，以見國貨衰落的一般：</p>
<p>年份　國貨出口總數　洋貨入口總數　國際貿易總數十二　九萬萬四千萬兩　十一萬萬二千萬兩　十八萬萬八千萬兩十三　十萬萬一千萬兩　十二萬萬七千萬兩　十九萬萬四千萬兩十四　十萬萬四千萬兩　十二萬萬一千萬兩　十九萬萬十五　十一萬萬二千萬兩　十三萬萬七千萬兩　二一萬萬八千萬兩十六　十二萬萬一千萬兩　十三萬萬兩　二一萬萬兩十七　十二萬萬三千萬兩　十四萬萬一千萬兩　二二萬萬二千萬兩十八　十二萬萬五千萬兩　十四萬萬八千萬兩　二三萬萬二千萬兩十九　十一萬萬三千萬兩　十五萬萬八千萬兩　二二萬萬三千萬兩二十　十一萬萬九千萬兩　十六萬萬三千萬兩　二三萬萬八萬兩二十一　七萬萬二千萬兩　十三萬萬一千萬兩　十七萬萬五千萬兩由是觀之，近一年來國際貿易，大大衰落。也可見國貨的輸出，與洋貨的輸入相差遠甚！與國際貿易更有天壤之别！國際貿易與國貨輸出，相差的總數一倍有奇，令人昨舌·</p>
<p>我們任洋貨儘量地輸入，任國貨不顧一切地衰落嗎？犧牲一切地退化嗎？任受列强經濟的侵略，而致亡國滅種的地步嗎？否則，在這國貨年，該如何洗心革面，盡力提倡，努力改造，迎合羣衆心理，求得盡善盡美的國貨呵！</p>

<p>— 胡樓貞女士</p>
<p>綠兒急忽忽地從學校放學回來，滿頭滿頰還正流着汗珠，面上帶着一些天眞相的憂慮，大有欲哭不得欲笑不能的樣樣！跑到他母親的面前，帶着囁嚅的口氣說道：</p>
<p>『媽！我怎麽樣？</p>
<p>『我今天在學校裏，聽見我們李先生說：「那一個小朋友買外國貨，尤其是日本貨的，便要罰它一塊大洋！」拿罰來的錢，捐給兒童救國飛機呢！』　　『好寳寳丨你雖然年紀才八九歲，倒很能夠知道愛國；在從前，你的爸爸還活着的時候，他便是提倡國貨抵制洋貨很熱烈的一個人，唉丨可惜他現在不在世了丨』</p>
<p>綠兒的媽媽用着撫慰和惋惜的口吻，給綠兒說；他母子兩個人，都流下了涙，綠兒很沉靜的，眼請釘住住他母親的身上，丨若有所思。</p>
<p>『好寳寳丨以前，那時你才五歲，我給你買了一把日本貨的小花傘，給你的父親大駡一頓，我當時不能忍耐一些兒，所以大起口角了！啊！現在想想，眞懊喪無窮，你爸爸的用心，眞不錯呀！····啊！我的寳寳，我只希望你繼續你爸爸遺志，去爲社會服務，努力宣傳國貨，打倒一切市塲上的外國貨，不要把雪白的錢，送給洋鬼子用！』</p>
<p>綠兒仍是沉寂的聽着，紅暈的臉上，頓時好像泛出一朶白雲；他低着頭兒，想到李先生說的話，想到大批的錢送給外國人去用········眞正不錯，又眞正太危險了！</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>現在中國因洋貨流入，弄得民窮財盡，海關一時尙不能盡量加稅，以阻止滔滔不絕的外國傾銷貨物。自己的工業又不能盡量供給本國的需要。故這一半機製一半是手工製造的本國貨品，海關旣不能完全保護，惟有人民抱定購用國貨的宗旨，纔可挽救過來。</p>
<p>但是一般人民究竟是很散漫，欲求有相當的效力，莫如由全國各學校的敎師個個發願，購用國貨，并且令學生也是購用國貨，勸民衆也購用國貨，那麽這種無形的勢力，實在是很偉大的。　　敎師諸君之不要看輕自巳的地位，須知這保護國貨的無冠帝皇，就是敎師。敎師實握有保護國貨的無上權力，爲條約所不能禁，爲兵力所不能及，帝國主義者就是十分兇猛，十分能耐，對於敎師的保護國貨究竟無法干涉。敎師諸君請認淸自巳的地位，認明自巳的力量，奮勉做去，報效國家！</p>
<p>國貨調查</p>
<h3 id="c193">我國之蚊烟香事業（下） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>日本的蚊烟香，除傾銷於朝鮮，印度，以及南洋羣島外，自然這產業落後的中國，也是其唯一的銷貨尾　，在五四以前，日本銷華的蚊烟香，每年總在一百萬元以上，抵制風潮起後，國人春夢　醒，知道要抵制别國的貨，先要謀自巳生產，於是國貨蚊香便應運而生。　　首先倣製新式蚊香成功者，是上海中國化學工業社，該社總經理方液仙君，爲了要研究日本的除蟲菊種植，曾幾次親往日本考察，歸來竭力宣傳，提倡種値，一面自闢除蟲菊農塲，聘請專家指導種植，一面廣勸鄉農種植而出善價收買，這樣的努力鼓吹，果然不數年間，成績頗著，至今該社所的三星牌蚊烟香，暢銷全國，每年銷額在四十萬以上，巳取得日貨猪牌蚊香的地位而代之了。</p>
<p>其次，無敵牌的散倉蚊香，因爲裝璜上的節省，售價比較便宜，所以社會人士，也很樂予購用，餘如永和實業公司的月裏嫦牌，大成廠的金蛛牌，五洲藥房的地球牌，每年銷額都很可觀，此外小規模的製造商，却也不少，一時很難調查。如無錫，丹陽，鎭江等處，有些香舗子也在兼製蚊香了。可惜總以原料不純，效力減少，致失購用者的信仰。</p>
<p>最後，我希望國產商亟須注意者：就是蚊香一物，雖然國貨巳可供給一般人民的需要但有待於國貨商努力者尙多。我們應該積極向外推展，卽如南洋　島，就有數百萬的華僑，至今仍在忍痛購置仇貨；考其原因，不日國貨價錢太貴，就是嫌着裝璜不合式，國貨廠商要更謀發展，應該在這些地方盡一些力，至少是要達到「中國人用中國貨」的目的！尤其是原料的供給，本國自巳的產額，不敷甚鉅，現在各廠家因爲抵制仇貨，不得不改向英美各國採購，這一筆利權外溢，國貨廠商是亟應繼續努力以謀自救的！同時希望鼓吹改進農村生產者</p>
<p>，也應當一致起來，帮助做這提倡種植除蟲菊的工作。</p>

<p>丨願全國小妹妹們都這樣做丨</p>
<p>蓬姊：</p>
<p>我雖然是個尙在幼穉時代的女孩子，但我自信愛國是不敢後人的！我最痛心的是一般無恥的靑年男女祇會空喊愛國，而見之於它們的實際行動呢，却立刻可以發現它們自身的矛盾了！！！不是嗎？抵制外貨，提倡國貨的聲浪，在從前我是不知道的，便在民國十四年那年那時我才八歲，對於提倡國貨的意義我還不能明瞭，但我明白這是全國一致的一刹那的呼聲，聽說不久又是烟消雲散，這是多麽痛心的事啊！以後以逢到民國十七年的五三「濟南慘案」，以及民國二十年的「萬寳山慘案」，「九一八」，和去年「一二八」一直到現在的嚴重國難，那一次不曾因了嚴重的剌激而興奮一時？那一次高唱提倡國貨抵制外貨而有效？····</p>
<p>啊！我的白蓬姊姊！我雖然年輕，但我看了這樣的社會人心支配着如此嚴重國難，誰也要痛心吧？我們也不必怨天尤人，我們只怪自己的不爭氣吧！我們誓從今天起，一切「唱高調」的老套也不必搬出來了，我們只希望大家切切實實地做我們所能做的事情！！！提倡國貨，拒用仇貨，這便是我們在此國難期間所應負的使命！蓬姊！我這封信並没有别的用意，能够公開最好，要不然，請你把我對於提倡國貨的一顆熱心捧出來和你的同學們看看，看她們有没有和我表同情的？不多談了，請你來信指敎我吧！但願你也和我做一個同志。祝你康健。你的妹妹白葦手筆</p>

<p>— 梁軼羣</p>
<p>王夫人是一個摩登少婦，同時也是頂刮刮的一位洋貨推銷員；他心目中以爲洋貨總是精緻的，不若國貨的粗劣，並且用舶來品才得配稱一聲時髦；所以家中一切日用品衣著等，統是來路貨。</p>
<p>王先生是懼内的，所以對於他夫人這種崇拜洋貨的心理，雖然不贊成，却也不敢哼一聲　　這一天下午，張載縫送來一套白府綢童裝，這是她最近爲她唯一的愛子雲兒新製的。她想：兒子放學回家時，見到這一套新裝，該是多麽歡喜哩！</p>
<p>出於意外的：往常雲兒回來時，總是跳跳躍躍的，今天却勿聲勿響，進來把書包一甩，翹起了小嘴，像同人鬥氣樣的。</p>
<p>「孩子，誰欺侮你嗎？告訴媽！····媽給你做了一套新衣裳，你歡喜嗎？」王夫人一面安慰她的愛子，一面把包好的嶄新的白府綢童裝打了開來，高高的提取來給雲兒瞧。</p>
<p>「誰要新衣裳，又是洋貨做的！這害人的洋貨，我不要穿！」雲兒瞧了一眼，恨恨的說。　　「孩子，洋貨是非常精緻的，你瞧這一件多麽漂亮啊，國貨那有這樣好看呢？···孩子，告訴吾，啥人說了你嗎？」</p>
<p>「榮生說我身上穿的都是洋貨，他駡我「小亡國奴」；我同他去告訴吳先生，吳先生說我們不應該穿洋貨，穿洋貨是没有面子的；我們有好好的國貨，爲什麽不去買呢？有些國貨也非常好看的；把錢送給外國人，外國人會買了槍砲來打我們，所以洋貨是害人的東西。媽，我不要穿這害人的洋貨了！」</p>
<p>「·············」</p>
<p>「媽，你怎麽不響呢？你眞不給我做一件中國貨的，他們又要駡我小亡國奴了；給他們駡，眞難爲情的。····」雲兒兩脚一　，哭起來了。</p>
<p>「好孩子，乖乖，不要哭！媽給你做一套國貨的服裝，好嗎？」王夫人急了，連忙將愛子抱了起來，拍着他。</p>
<p>「媽，給我立刻去做！洋貨我們從此不要再去買它了。媽的衣裳也要用國貨的，不好嗎？」雲兒止了哭說。</p>
<p>「好，媽依你的話，我們從此一切都買國貨。」王夫人似乎也覺悟到自己一味醉心洋貨的不當，所以堅决地說；一面給雲兒揩去眼角的涙痕。</p>
<p>雲兒才歡喜得躱在母親懐裏笑了。</p>

<p>「高等華人」，愛用「西洋貨」，「高等華人」之下，一直到到「僕歐」，「苦力」，愛用「東洋貨」，或「東洋貨」與「西洋貨」並用。雖然貨品上寫着洋文「在中國製造」字樣，表示這是帶些「洋味」的，但上中下三等人見了，總有些「喔，中同貨，哼！」</p>
<p>中國人眞是「福如東海」，這些年正苦「金貴銀賤，」買不起洋貨，可巧外國</p>

<p>— 圖南</p>
<p>江湖賣解一流，是拿着藝術來過它們的流浪生涯的，其中不乏色藝雙絕的小姑娘，表演着驚人絕技，但是在那種班子裏的生活是非常痛苦的，班主是祇管欲博得觀衆們的欣賞而多得着些賞　，所以鞭策着伊們賣力的表演，假使伊們身子有些病痛或不適，還是不讓伊們稍微的休養，班主的手段雖然慘酷，但爲着生活的驅使也是没有辦法的，有時碰到不巧，一輩當地的土劣，强要娶伊們去做妾，班子裏依着伊們做錢樹子的，那裏會得答應，但是土劣的惡勢力非常厲害，想了種種法子來破壞它，這個班子立不住脚，又只好流浪到别處去了。</p>
<p>關於江湖賣解，還有一件比較香豔而有意義的事，一位詩禮人家的子弟，看中了一個賣藝的姑娘，打得火一般熱，在舊禮敎束縛時代，居然能夠打破門戶之見，掙得家長的同意，退了巳訂婚的妻子，毅然的娶這位賣解女子做夫人，非但不卑鄙伊的職業，並且還鼓勵伊帮着伊改進藝術成爲一種高尙而含有提倡敎育的娛樂。</p>
<p>這幾天新光大戲院開映的一部明星公司新片「健美之路」。就拿江湖賣解作題材的，由徐琴芳女士飾賣解女，表現活潑，能將江湖流浪者的估性，完全流露。這片子不論在意識上，技巧上，都是値得我們一看的。</p>

<p>班出去，將趙自强引了進來，他却是很客氣，搶着進門來，就伸出手來，和甘二爺握了幾握，然後笑道：兄弟來得冒昧得很請您原諒。積之雖是討厭軍人的，可是人家這樣的和氣，却也不能不笑臉相迎，京挪開椅子，讓他坐下笑</p>
<p>道：我們這樣寄住會館的人，有朋友來探望，那就很不錯，那裏還敢提到冒昧兩個字？他說着話，好像想起一件什麽事，立刻拿起兩本書，向桌上一蓋，在他這書本一舉，未曾蓋下之前；趙自强巳經看得淸楚，桌上放了一張當票，當票上面，放有兩堍現洋，甘積之放下的書，就蓋在這當票上，而且裝出一種很不經意的樣子。在這上面，很可以知道他是恨想把這當當的窮相掩蓋起來的。再看這屋子裏，除了床頭邊爾隻方凳，疊架了兩隻半舊的箱子而外，並没有别種貴重的東西。這床根本就是一個木板架子。那四方桌子上，連桌布也没有，只是厚的墊了幾張報紙。倒是亂七八糟的，堆了書本不少。就在這上面，又可以知道如何的窮。把自己原來猜想他升官晋職的思想，完全消滅了。這就向他笑道：我今天來得，固然是有些冒昧，可是我多少有點事情敢來的。積之笑道：趙連長，有什麽話，你只管指敎罷。他說着，將桌子角上的老盜壼提起，斟了一杯白開水，放到趙自强面前。笑道：眞是對不起。到我們這裏來，連茶烟都没有的。趙自强笑道；請你不必客氣，我要是客氣，就不這樣冒昧的跑着來了。上次您託我轉告的話，我巳經對楊家老太太說了，他没有說什麽？說時，就看着積之的臉。積之笑道；我也猜着他們不會說什麽的。趙自强道：甘先生在海甸，不是同令兄住在一處嗎？爲什麽一個人搬到城裏來住呢？有什麽高就</p>

<p>— 俞友淸</p>
<p>紅豆，亦名相思子，產於嶺南，木質蔓生，幹高丈餘，葉爲羽狀複葉，秋開小花，花冠爲蝶形，色白或淡紅，實成莢子，大如豌豆，微扁，色鮮紅，亦有半紅半黑者。相傳有人殁於邊，其妻思之，哭於樹下，而卒，故名。唐以來，詩人多詠之。</p>
<p>廣東新語：相思子木理似槐，大者斜鋸之，有細花雲，亦曰雞翅木，以其紋似也。</p>
<p>匋　紅豆瑣談；紅豆一名相思子，其色赤，紅潤欲滴，花顏如梓，莢小如槐角，數年一實唐王右丞維摩詰，有相思一絕：紅豆生南國，春來發幾枝，願君多采擷，此物最相思。在唐時，此物巳視爲俊品。</p>
<p>温庭筠新添聲楊柳枝詞：玲瓏骰子安紅豆，入骨相思知不知？紅豆相思，深可入骨。</p>

<p>陳允平春歸詞：雙燕歸來後，相思葉底尋紅豆，個中畫意，呼之欲出。</p>
<p>龔定庵王次回詩集中，常有紅豆兩字，大都無題寫情之作，以紅豆兩字，爲點綴之品。　　紅豆山房，淸康熙間，吳縣惠棟藏書處，有百歲堂書目三卷，按惠氏有紅豆書莊，在蘇城東南冷香溪之北，先是東禪寺，有紅豆樹，相傳白鴿禪師所種，老而朽，復萌新枝，惠周愓一枝植階前，因自號紅豆主人，僧目存爲繪紅豆新居圖，見郎紀濳聞，故藏書處亦名紅豆也　　紅豆山莊，淸錢謙益牧齋晚年所居之處，在常熟縣境，亦因其地有紅豆樹而名，謙益自號紅豆老人。</p>
<p>昔吳門理禪寺白鴿禪師，偶拾紅豆，種之寺内，指而囑曰：汝宜速長，但他日不許無故開花，世變有大小，則花開有疏密，見鈕琇觚　。今東禪寺遺址未詳，而紅豆樹尙存，巳歸徐琦仲家，其地蓋在蘇之葑門附近云。白鴿禪師，以世事之變遷，付諸紅豆，責其疏密，老僧</p>
<p>亦太不解事矣。一笑。</p>
<p>紅豆樹，相傳世間祗有三樹，一在常熟，即所謂紅豆山莊也，一在蘇州，卽徐琦仲家物。一在温州，則未睹記載，不可查考，此是徐琦仲紅豆瑣談中語。以余所知，又有江陰顧山一樹，及蘇州木瀆鎭山塘永寗莊内一樹，顧山紅豆樹，我未之見，而木瀆紅豆樹，去夏相見，樹高大，實不多，且色淡少圓。</p>
<p>觚　載：昔有怨婦，日望其夫歸，灑涙樹下，血染其枝，旋結成子，此物相思之由來，而南國一詩，詩人託物，未可據爲事實》</p>
<p>徐琦仲有紅豆詩：手拈鸚粒三分妬，心透靈犀一點痴，以紅豆比鸚粒，有義山錦瑟之思。　　寒雲袁克文，曾與俞逸芬創辦紅豆報，未數期而夭，報名紅豆，令我有無限相思之情。今者文友老去，　上雲歸，讚某君悼袁詩，有一生事業幾紅裙句，信陵酖酒婦人，豈得巳哉？余不禁感慨系之。昔年寒雲曾向余索紅豆雙顆，由津友陳君之介，今寒雲謝世，不知雙紅豆仍在否？</p>
<p>劃大白得江陰周剛直雙紅豆，有三首雙紅豆曲，今摘其數句，曰：嘉名紅豆呼，曰：生怕相思種子無：曰：紅豆雙貯錦囊。曰：相思憑此傳。豆以人傳，人以詞傳，我爲紅豆幸矣。剛直成烈，而大白亦巳墓草靑靑，聞大白身後、十分蕭條，令人有文士多窮之嘆。</p>

<p>善於治國平天下的人物，眞能隨處看出治國平天下的方法來，四川正有人以爲長衣消耗布疋，派隊剪除；上海又有名公要來整頓茶館了，據說整頓之處，大略有三：一是注意衛生，二是制定時間，三是施行敎育。</p>
<p>第一條當然是很好的：第二條，雖然上館，一一搖鈴，像學校裏的上課一樣，未免有些麻煩，但爲了要喝茶，没有法，也不算壞。</p>
<p>最不容易是第三條。『愚民』的到茶館來，是打聽新聞，閒談心曲之外，也來聽聽『包公案』一類東西的，時代巳遠，眞僞難明，那邊妄言，這邊妄聽，所以他坐得下去。現在倘若改爲『某公案』，就恐怕不想信，不要聽；專講敵人的秘史，黑幕罷，這邊之所謂敵人，未必就是他們的敵人，所以也難免聽得不大起</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>南京的解娼禁與不解娼禁問題，曾經由行政院討論過，其問題之重要可知。解娼禁的正面理由，說是要解救市塲的不景氣，即得興女閭以繁榮市面。反解禁的理由，大都是偏重風化與道德，也說到女子的人格等等。道德與繁榮不可得兼，這事實在是很難解决的。</p>
<p>在娼禁問題討論未有結果以前，在下何敢參與未議。但在下讀聖人書多年，說是娼一解禁，市面即可繁榮；或是娼不解禁，風化即可維持；反復之間，關係如此其重大，竟全然不知道，眞是所學何事！不過我所想起的是：北平有一位敎授，熱心研究社會問題，特地託一位朋友介紹和一位妓女開誠布公來談論。那位敎授問她：『我設法援助你出去好嗎？』敎授預想她的回答即不感激，至少是願意。誰知妓女竟給一個否定的回答。妓女問那位敎授：『你援助我出去，呌我去做什麽？我能去做什麽？我有老了的母親和父親，三個弟弟，一個妹子：這麽一家子，將怎樣辦？』這位敎授給她堵住了口，半句也回答不出。（詳見大公報社會問題雙週刋）照這位妓女的雄辯看來，娼的解禁不解禁，市面的繁榮與枯落，風化的維持與失墜，都没有什麽關係；她要吃飯，她一家人要吃飯，即非賣淫不可：雖研究社會問題的大學敎授也無話可說。德人柯祖基所說：『資本家不但利用她們的無經騐給她們少到不夠自巳開銷的工錢，而且對她們暗示，或者甚至明說，只有賣淫是補充收入的一個法子，在資本制度之下，賣淫成了社會的台柱子。』這些話，竟是掻着癢處了。</p>

<p>— 何如</p>
<p>蕭伯訥　梅蘭芳博士曰，『中國戲何以須用鑼鼓？』博士曰，『崑曲中亦有不用鑼鼓者。』此雖捷對，猶嫌飾辭也。葉恭綽先生問蕭翁曰，『何故不食肉？』蕭曰，『我不食肉，所以不食肉。』梅博盍答蕭曰，『中國戲須用鑼鼓，所以　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　來，　亦以幽默往，此之請禮尙往來，豈不益見禮義之邦，未可經視邪？蕭伯訥目無中國，我正可以『毌謂秦無人』折之也。前見自由談内聚仁先生讑鑼鼓一文，觸發予思，頗擬申論：終以偃臥病牀，無能爲役。今者梅博士又來上海登臺奏技矣，鑼鼓之聲，洋洋盈耳，焉得默然無言乎？</p>
<p>予謂中國自有戲劇之一物，即不離鑼鼓，無論國渣國粹，繋乎見智見仁。花部亂彈，固然未免鑼鼓喧　。以崑曲言，曷嘗不重鑼鼓？淸初李笠翁嘗有鑼鼓忌雜之言矣。彼以爲戲塲鑼鼓，筋節所關。當敲不敲，不當敲而敲，與宜重而輕，宜輕反重者，均足令戲文减價，此中亦具至理，非老於優孟者不知。最忌在要緊關頭忽然打斷，如說白未了之際，曲調初起之時，横敲亂打，蓋却聲音，使聽白者少聽數句，以致前後情事不連，審音者未聞起調，不知以後所唱何曲。打斷曲文，罪猶可恕：抺殺賓白，情理難容。又有一齣戲文將了，止餘數句賓白未完，而此未完之數句又係關鍵所在，乃戲房鑼鼓，早己催促收場，使說與不說同者，殊可痛恨，故疾徐輕重之間不可不急講也。塲上之人，將要說　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　過難專委，曲白鑼鼓均分其咎矣。笠翁此論發於崑曲没落之際，當時無人注意。迨亂彈起，鑼鼓愈雜，且非此不足以使塲面熱閙，此亂彈之所以爲亂彈也。　所謂亂彈，今以二黃爲正宗。二黃所用之樂器，如大鑼、小鑼，小鐺鑼，大鼓，大鈸，小鈸，檀板等，僅能發不規則之噪音。或助塲面之熱閙，或定說唱之起訖，　表情感之張弛，或示動作之疾徐。鑼鼓之作用如此，至其音樂上之意義，則無甚可方也。鑼鼓之敲法，除牌子外，細分之，大小約在二十種左右。牌子中之水龍吟，將軍令等，雖似一種和聲組織，其實亦惟用以用節奏，壯聲勢而巳。二十年來之二黃，鑼鼓愈響愈妙，武戲不惜敲破大鑼，以壯脚色之</p>
<p>聲威。歐陽予倩先生謂此等鼓手之耳較常人爲　，有年老竟成聾蟲者，雖似戲言，亦實况也。</p>
<p>總之，予以爲中國戲之遠源出自角觝爲戲。秦漢以至隋唐之角觝爲戲，一稱散樂，散見諸史禮樂志。角觝武術，固須有金鼓以示進退，而壯陣容：音樂之中亦不能不用金革。此我國舊戲所以不廢武把子與鑼鼓之故歟？未知梅博士以爲何如也。</p>

<p>紅蘿蔔鬚本來巳經走開了，聽到這句話便回轉身來，在他母親後面跟着走了幾步。末了，他突然搶在他母親前面，攔着路，一聲不響，把一面臉送過去。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的（舉起右手，就要打下來了。）！我知道你扯謊，但我料不到你會這樣利害。現在，你扯了兩層謊啦。這樣下去，起首偷一隻鷄蛋，隨後偷一匹牛，再後就要謀殺他的母親了。（第一個巴掌落下了）</p>
<p>個人的思想</p>
<p>雷辟克先生，大哥菲利克斯，姐姐愛勒絲丁和紅蘿蔔鬚晚飯後坐在壁前面閑談着，壁爐裏面燒着一個連根的樹頭，於是四把椅子都堅在前面兩隻脚上搖蕩着。大家爭論着，紅蘿蔔鬚當雷辟克家的不那兒的時候，便發揮着他的個人的思想。</p>
<p>「據我的意思，」他說，「家族的稱呼是没有一點意思的。　如，爸爸，你知道我是怎樣愛你的！可是我愛你，並不因爲你是我的父親的緣故：我愛你，是因爲你是我的朋友的緣故。實在說來，你是毫没有什麽功勞可以做我的父親的，但我把你對我的友誼看作一種很高的恩惠，這種恩惠你本來可以不必給我而你竟寛洪地給了我。」</p>
<p>「啊！」雷辟克回答。</p>
<p>「我呢，我呢？」大哥菲利克斯和姐姐愛勒絲丁一齊問。</p>
<p>「那是一樣的，」紅蘿蔔鬚說。一命運使得你們做了我的哥哥格姐姐。我爲什麽要因此感謝你們呢？假如我們三個人不同生在雷辟克家裏，那又怪誰？你們是無力阻止這樣的事情出現的。對於你們這種不是出自本心的親族關係，我是用不着感覺愉快的。我所要惑謝你們的祇是，哥哥，你保護着我，姐姐，你給我有用的照顧。」</p>
<p>「應當給你效勞的，」大哥菲利克斯說。</p>
<p>「他爲什麽要想起一些這樣的念頭呢？」姐姐愛勒絲丁說。</p>
<p>「並且我所說的話，我可以槪括的肯定起來，我並不指定個人說，就是媽媽在這裏，我也會當着她的面重說一遍的。」</p>
<p>「你不會重說兩遍的，」大哥菲利克斯說。</p>
<p>「你覺得我的話有什麽壞處呢？」紅蘿蔔鬚回答。「請你不要改變我的思想罷！我不單不是没有良心的人，並且我愛你們的心思，比表現在面上的還深刻。可是這種愛情不是凡俗的，本能的，慣習的，而是有意的，理智的，還輯的。邏輯的，對啦，這正是我所找尋的字句。」</p>
<p>「你究竟要什麽時候才會改掉這種習慣呢？！！這種喜歡使用一些自己並不了然的字句，並且亂臭未乾便要把它們轉敎給人的習慣。」雷辟克說，他站起身預備去睡，「如果你的祖父在世的話，他祗要聽到我說着你所說的話的四分之一時，他便會連忙給我一脚或是一掌，證明我始終祗是他的孩子。」（未完）</p>

<p>— 小之</p>
<p>這一向，嘴巴雖癢，但爲着貼上了一張狗皮膏藥，說話不十分方便，所以就沉默了好些時，昨天翻讀某報，因爲國家大事非我們小孩家所能知其玄妙各高遠，而我也好在懶得去操心，於是盡量的把的謂「人慾横流十三四歲男女孩眞個銷魂」「强刦十二萬八千現欵」以及「紅丸」「毒物」之類的新聞一條一條的極精神地細讀着，最後，竟給我如獲至寳地發現了一件怪而且奇，奇而又妙，妙得要笑疼肚皮的事丨</p>
<p>這事發生在常熱，某報是如此的載着：</p>
<p>某漁人將其綱得之「頭如笆斗，足似翅膀而無指爪，背上更有白色梅斑數十，身長七尺，計重百念斤」之巨龜一頭，運入城内公園展覽，事爲一般好善之士知悉，咸認此龜具有靈異，主張放生，故醵資三百五十元向該漁人購得，於昨日由該大善士們及某某方丈大和尙用鞭砲軍藥隊自公園内將龜一路護送至大東門外，搭乘預約之汽油船直放滸浦，····</p>
<p>讀至此，我深驚以爲怪，所怪者是『此世界上居然會有偌大一個大烏龜，其次是烏龜大了也是値得受所謂善士們的「鞭砲軍樂」的歡送的』，然而關於「歡送」的事，我們在慣於「歡送」的今日看來、這是不足奇的，何况歡送一只大烏龜，具有靈異的大烏龜，</p>
<p>至於我說的可奇，奇而又妙，妙得要笑疼肚皮，并足以大書特書的事，都在這裏，</p>
<p>···船前後且有盒子砲武裝者兩人保護，（小之想，這大槪是防止綁票或暗殺吧？）過梅李時，岸上萬頭攅動，爭睹究竟，（小之問，其盛况較之去年十月二十一日北平太和殿前，人山人海，皆以爭睹班禪法像爲快的，時輪金剛</p>
<p>法會爲如何？）···泊駐滸浦之常熟唯一戢盜保民之「鎭虞」兵艦，巳升火待發，該艦官長以下，均鵠立以候，見載龜汽油船至，即將該龜搬運至艦中，護送人士亦過船入艦，該艦立即開足馬力，直駛口外之三十里處，由巡警將該龜抬送下水，當時方丈大和尙率領同行人士宣誦放生咒，（小之急喊彌陀佛，南無觀世音菩薩，）跪拜恭送，一時禮至隆重，（小之曰、理當如此，不然大烏龜　起靈來，或作起怪來，老百姓豈不活遭殃耶，）龜旣去艦始駛回，護送人士亦搭原船返城，（辛苦了，護送人士，）</p>
<p>小之義務决算，是役也，除太烏龜自由再造，榮歸澤國，與某漁人獲得三百五十元回家大吃酒外，㈠忙煞，常熟人，㈡巡警汗流浹背，（巡警是放龜下水的大功臣，）㈢放去若干鞭砲，燒掉幾許汽油和「艦煤」此外，還有武裝，軍樂，唸咒，拜跪，····</p>

<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>莫談國事，讓我來談風月　　「風」嗎？這　天正是黃梅的時　，風吹來使人感到不快；月嗎？月又到了下　的時候雖然二更以後也許會從雲　　　　　　　　　　　　得可憐。在　　風不　月不白之夜，我只是在自巳　室　中靜坐着，四壁沈沈中，我的耳畔忽然浮起來一陣白雲鵬小黑姑娘嬝嬝的大鼓餘音。</p>
<p>白雲鵬和小黑姑娘，我在他們臨去的前幾天才看到的。那天晚上我悶得兇，就决定到北平書塲去逛一會，我對於大鼓雖不十分瞭解，但對於這悠然的神韵是很能夠欣賞的。到書塲的時候還早，正有别的人在唱。在這幾個人的歌唱中，使我對於大鼓的眞味領會了不少。後來，小黑姑娘在滿塲喝采聲中從帷幕後翩然地出來了，她眞是個美麗的女郎，在滿臺鮮花和燈光掩映中她更顯得嬌艷了，這些鮮花都是有情的公子們贈送的，以爲臨别的紀念，記得那夜臺上有兩個做滑稽相聲的穿插著說：</p>
<p>「你這這滿臺的鮮花送給誰？」「這都是送給我們的小黑姑娘的。」「送花你道爲甚麽？」「這是有情的少爺們春戀姑娘的衷示。等會兒，這花也許還要還給</p>
<p>他們的。」「這又是爲什麽呢？」「因爲姑娘就要走了以後少爺們想起姑娘時，就　可以　　　　嗅一番，就　見姑娘一樣」　丨這話，我見得怪有趣的。</p>
<p>小黑姑娘那天唱的是大西廂，眞唱得仰揚宛轉極了，唱到「···孤孤單單冷冷淸淸空空勞勞凄凄凉凉···」一句，眞像空山颯雨的馳驟，唱到「···低頭不語，寂寞無言，腰兒瘦損···」却又像幽俗鶯聲的頓挫，可是到了後半節，采聲是愈喝愈高，歌喉却反被掩住了。不久，小黑姑娘便進去了，我喝了口茶期待着白雲鵬，我想像着這個北方人，一定是彪形的大漢，不料門簾揭去，却出來了一個風度潇灑的儒者，眞出我的意料之外！他大約巳經是五十以外的人了，他操着極流利的北平語，句句字字都講得非常淸晰。他有着豐富的感情，他有着謙虚的態度，那晚因爲是最後的一天，他說了許多的話：「···别了，諸位先生，終于别了。我們這些卑卑不足道的水玩意兒能得諸位先生的賞識，我們是非常感激而且漸愧。雖然我們在我們的藝術上也下了不少功夫，然而我們終究不免是風流乞丐囉···」這話是多麽的婉轉而又感慨啊。他唱的正是黛玉焚稿，他說：「···這幾天我完全是把紅樓夢來唱。紅樓夢自然是極好的材料，可是苦了我自己了，每天唱了一段，我總要哭了一會啊！···」你聽，這話又是多麽的富於詩意！他的歌聲最使我滿意，徐縱急送，語語傳神。唱到急處，有像驟雨；唱到輕處，又像泣訴，其中「···瘦得個柳腰兒無有一把，病得個杏臉兒又焦黃，咳嗽不住鶯聲兒</p>
<p>啞，嬌喘難停粉鼻兒張···」一段，尤其使我感動；他唱到「····誰似我伶仃孤苦還更堪傷···」他的眼角便潤濕了，這是我很深刻的印象。</p>
<p>白雲鵬的藝　是値得贊美的，他給我一個深刻的印象·然而他們去了，每到公後休息的時候，我懐念着這個藝術家，我只有空　地欣賞　　，　　　　腦　的　　的餘音　　。</p>

<p>星期聚餐會，這巳是第四次了。照過去的三次來說，大致還算順利。不過·雖然限定每人祗許喝一小杯酒，可是在每次席散的時候，終有一二位面孔像昇火似的，至少有些不自隨，但是，分明這不是酒醉。</p>
<p>在一桌豐滿的十二大元的筵席旁，團團團着十個吃星，男女雜坐，當然也無分賓手主了。個個抖擻精精神，放出了他們天天所熟練的隨身本領，萊上，動員令下，箸子就像雨點般的集中在一個盆子上，直到盆底完全泛出本色，才得罷休。</p>
<p>毫無目的的閒談，由天南說到地北，可是，要想還找第一句話的開端，往往是無從追索的，我們不知從什麽事情談起，東址西撞的·談到枝女和舞女的身上了。</p>
<p>『妓女，舞女，都是她們自己甘願的堕落。」於是李師毌對於她們就發出了一些議論。『一個人，天賦給她們兩只手，什麽事都可去做，何必一定要去做這種下賤的勾當？』</p>
<p>『可不是啊！她們·····』王小姐也很表同情的附和她。</p>
<p>『不過，這不是女的一方面的錯處。』李師母忽然轉換話風，似乎對妓女和舞女抱了一些寛恕的能度。『假使没有男子去鬼混，那她們怎樣能得立足？所以這還是男子的不是。』當然李師母不是無的放矢的。</p>
<p>李先生一聲不響的獨自　他的瓜子。</p>
<p>『那未必吧！這也是生活逼迫她們到這樣的。』大哥大槪見子李先生那般侷促不安的態度·太難堪了·所以他第一個提出了異議，可是他畢竟是個忠厚長者，所以他的話總是比較的和平。但是辯論的陣勢就在這個時候開展了。</p>
<p>『那麽，林先生··他們遭生活的壓迫，怪可憐的，還請你老先生去照顧照顧呢！』不要聽小張的話，只要一見他的臉就可知道他的爲人了。尤其他今天在王小姐的面前，當然站入她的戰線上去，而特别的顯出他尖刻的本領。接着就是一陣皮動肉不動的冷笑。</p>
<p>李師母王小姐都得意的笑了，大家都笑了，大哥有些窘了，他裝着假鎭靜的樣子，對準着盆子儘是吃萊。這時忽然在我的身旁，衝出了一支生力軍加入了反對戰線而很堅决的說··</p>
<p>『大家要知道··這個問題·并不是幾個人的事情，也不獨是男子應負的責任，這是什麽人應當負一些的。換句話說，一種生活環增的襲撃，决不是個人能夠抵抗得住的，這是應當整個的社會去負責的。』葉先生的臉部完全漲紅了，在他的頭勁裏，還　出如手指粗的一根靑筋。最後他還自言自語的道··『誰不願吃一桌十二大元的酒席？』</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>我是一個工人，所以知識很欠缺；遇到問題時，總不免發生困難的。現在我又遇到問題了；請先生費一些時間，指示我，永不忘你的恩德了。</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，他從前在離我家没有多遠的一爿烟紙店内當學徒，所以與他認識的，後來他到某醫院裏當練習生，我呢，仍在工廠中做此牛馬工作。到去年「一二八」戰事發生之後，我失業了。後來都承他與我找到職業，在某藥房當練習生，但是要一百元膳宿費，一年畢業。後來我發覺這藥房是滑頭的，招練習生是做一百元收入的把戲：故此我未落此圈套。但我那　友人呢，他就此對我非常輕視·說我無上道的心，走堕落的途徑。後來我在另一爿工廠找到職業，這是去年的話了。近日我那個朋友又碰到了，他仍此種口氣說，廠内做工，永不會翻身的。我被他一番　　，眞氣死人了。後來我自己想想，他的話是不錯的。我呢，决意要在這工業方面努力求進步。我們的工業是製漆，我現在對此項工業，雖談不上學識資格，但實地經騐，確有些成績。不過雖有成績，必須要拿學問與資產來支配。所以我要在此項工業上成功，正是有天無日了。我想在知識方面，求進多，但是每月收入只有十三元，衣食住都在這裏開支，再加有病請假，要扣薪水的，故此對於求知慾望，非常困難。不曉得那裏有義務的學校，如有義務做好事的先生，來帶我出路，那就是我的大恩人了。我要請問，這樣去滿足我求知慾望，將來可有希望没有。未了，再有父親常常向我拿錢，我並不是不肯，不過實情我没有餘錢來把父親呢！也請你替我想一個法子！祝你</p>
<p>安好沈孝欽上</p>
<p>XXXX編者按：社會是靠各方面的共同努力而支持的，所以一個人，除了坐吃之外，要是他能做相富工作，抵償他的消費，那末就没有誰貴誰賤的分别了：做官與做「倒老爺」，同樣是替人羣服務。明乎這個道理，我們就能夠做到「恒一字的地步，不致見異思遷，一塲没結果了。令友的話，雖說出於一腔熱血，但終不免有些輕視勞工的成見：你對於他這種態度，能委言說明，最好，否則「心領謝謝」可也。你能夠立志向工業方面求進步，是正當的；對於藥房裏的職務，因非素習，即使非滑頭，夫之亦復不足惜。</p>
<p>至於完全盡義務的補習學校，合你的我們没有聽到過；這完全因爲他們也自有其費用呀。但是收費極廉，而且對於窮人可以酌减的地方，滬上很多，你可以向你住處鄰近的補習學校，去要求减費。可惜本報現在辦的幾個業餘補習學校離你的地方太遠；要是你不嫌稍遠，或者將來我們添設的話，我們是可以特别通融的。</p>
<p>父子之間，關乎天性；你要是十分爲難，祗須相見以誠，他或許不至於要爲難你罷。不過要是他的爲難程度，萬一遠過於你，那末你也應略有點綴。總之應當看你的能力，與也的需要而定，開誠布公，就是了。</p>

<p>一會兒，石喬又朝東走了轉來，意外大膽地拉拉她的手，只没有說什麽話便上樓到自巳房裏去了。</p>
<p>美子不自主的跟到他的房裏，找不出適當的話便問：『你又回來做什麽，看你樣子不是很忙嗎？』</p>
<p>我們也要和你們去打仗了，曉得嗎？我回來是寫我們怎樣組織學生義勇軍的計劃，他們便分頭去接洽！』</p>
<p>『什麽？你們要和我們打仗？我們不是做了很久的好朋友，現在還住在一起嗎？』</p>
<p>石喬笑了笑，回答不出來。從美子這句問話裏，啓示出所謂民族間的結怨並不在於一般普遍的民衆，日帝國主義的進攻中國更不是爲了民衆，這與美子多麽隔膜阿！石喬要去打仗的敵人當然不是美子的『，而正是美子的』他們』呀！</p>
<p>美子在這種很自然的反問之後，又無端的觸起了身世飄流的悲感。眼臉垂落下來，手將衣紐輕捻着。李石喬自知失言，總想說幾句話安慰她，却越急越找不出適當的温柔的話，只是呆呆的看住她：看看這異國淪落的女郎，僕素的衣飾！她從來不穿日本服裝！配合她那消瘦苗條的身裁，冷感凄　得像一個西洋修道女；那『美』，是以精神的靈魂的光來打動人的。石喬起初將兩手伸出去，做着幾乎要抱住她的姿勢，隨即便將手縮回來！抱住一個有夫之婦是不行的，欺侮一個可憐的女性是不行的；但是那捻衣紐的手却勾住他的臂膀了，而且那身體更換近了來，無力的頭靠倒在他的肩上，輕柔的話語從那蒼白的唇裏緩慢地漏出來；</p>
<p>『你眞要去打仗嗎？李先生！』逗了一下：戰爭，戰爭，爲什麽有戰爭呢？』</p>

<p>— 遜南</p>
<p>離愁别緖何處可以寄託　　古宮景物尙作數日留連　　葛雷泰嘉　巳　回好萊塢去了。經遏了這許多的紛紜。這啞謎居然打破了。她於三月二十四日乘了一隻輪船，很秘密的，悄然地離開了瑞典的古特保埠，在海上經過了五個星期之久；於四月三十日安抵美國加利福尼亞省的聖帝艾哥埠。美國電影雜誌有一家ScreenBook替她記載得很詳。下面的就是葛萊泰嘉賣未離瑞典前部份的事蹟，因爲這段小事紀，能在極平談之中，顯得有些悽淸動人，所以把牠譯了出來。</p>
<p>葛萊泰嘉　向瑞典京城告别了。她和朋友馬克斯龔柏耳，坐了他的杜森堡車子，向各街道行駛了一週。龔柏耳是位工程師，嘉　在没有到奸萊塢之前就認識了。這回嘉　回到故鄉，龔柏耳是她的伴侶，陪着她拍網球，游泳，跳舞。因爲他主張的緣故，她在瑞京地產事</p>
<p>業，投了不　的資本，她至少巳經買了兩所房子。她和他週游瑞京各處，到　流連，頗有依依不拾的神氣，大槪故鄉的一草一木，在她離别後，必定要在她夢寐之中，　　不巳的了。在她未離開瑞京一星期之前，嘉　曾和她的老友　希邁斯特伯爵及伯爵夫人，去看過「大飯店」影片的開幕。這是她主演的片子，所以她進了戲院，她被敦　而在銀幕前登了次的臺。</p>
<p>在三月十四日，消息傳了出去，說嘉寳小姐在格列柏斯霍船上巳定了艙位，定於四月一日啟椗。所以一般新聞記者們，都很忙碌　籌備起來。但是嘉寳亦太惡作劇了，因爲四月一日，本爲是愚人節，所以新聞記者們直到上了當繼明白。</p>
<p>在三月二十一日嘉寳女士離開了旦得蘭花園七號的寓所，向她的母親兄弟作了末次的訪問，於是一個人上别　去了。直到那天晚上，她纔發現於蒂十坦，就是渥　斯特伯爵的别墅，亦是嘉賣逃避人君的樂土。那裂離瑞京約有五十英里，係風景幽絕的所在。這所别墅原是一座行宮，建築於一六三○年，但到了十七世紀的末葉，就落在渥希邁斯特家屬的手中了。二十二日和二十三日，嘉　就在這個地方倘徉流連着，很悄然地獨自向各處寄託了離愁别緖。有時和渥希邁斯特的女公子瓊尼拉騎着馬去游玩，外面一些没有與故　告别的樣子。但是到了二十四日，星期五，渥希邁斯特夫婦由蒂士坦啟和赴古特堡港了，他們上了船，中間</p>
<p>夾着一位不知姓名的人。這船名AnnieJohnson，而那位怪客名JohnEmerSon先生。船長特爲這位怪客造了一所游水池以及種奢憊侈的設備。這位怪客上了船，船長立卽召集了全體人員會護等等，吩吋他們對於這位怪客不許提起他（或她）的名字。但是有一位看護婦，聽見了派她待候這怪客，快樂得幾乎暈倒了！</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>新的作風好的技巧</p>
<p>丨動盪中的社會縮影丨</p>
<p>的確，這是歐美影片中不可多得的作品。假如我們能夠客觀的不再嚴格的或不懐着大的希望，那未很可以認定這是資本主義電影中最高限度所能做到的程度。如欲再進一步的表現出來，那祗有蘇聯的作品才敢如此大膽了。</p>
<p>本片的劇情是以女學校的學生和校長之間情感的衝突爲題材。天眞和平的女孩兒們，她們要求着自由，她們渴望着人與人之間的眞摯的愛。但是封建的</p>
<p>校長，却對她們施以軍國民敎育，禁止她們的一切自由。於是學生們因此發生内心的反感。雖然平素懾服於高壓的勢力之下，但到底由於同情心的共嗚，而接近騒亂。最後，校長亦覺管理失敗，自行引退</p>
<p>就故事的本身說，似乎本片主要的目的在乎反對軍民敎育。其實這是聰明的製作者將本片作爲動盪中的社會的縮影，說明着壓迫者被壓迫者之間的衝突，大多數的人們在飢渴着仁愛與和平，他們爲自由而犧牲，他們要在自由的空氣中呼吸生存。可是壓迫者却不給與他們以自由的機會，充其景祗能當「校長誕日，校中開會　祝，」類似的時機中，才有一次範圍以内的歡樂。很明顯的，壓迫者以其至高的權威企圖永遠保</p>
<p>存他的統治，甚至於迫人趨於死地亦在所不惜。可是這「愛與憎」的對立，總有一天會來一次總的爆發，而爲了避免這不幸的燬滅，唯一的辦法只有請求統治「健美之路」明星公司出品·徐琴芳　　鄭小秋主演。</p>
<p>者自動的放棄他的統治了。！這是本片作者最大的苦心。</p>
<p>當然這是立於壓迫者的地位而又怕聽被壓迫者的哀號之聲的人們最徹底的辦法。因爲他懂得了「壓力高其反抗力亦高」的物理原即，與其等待將來的一發而不可收拾，倒不如將壓迫者的地位放棄。但是眞的不必要水的反抗力而木塞會自動離去嗎？當然這是非物理的幻想了。進一步說，女校長的離校，不過是要那一位女敎員換上一套比較利和緩的管理方法，總不至於這一學校由學生自行管理。所以，本片並没有放棄自己的地位，不過以爲這種形式不大合理罷了關於演出，不僅是全部都是女性而較新奇，而且有着顯明的新的作風。不誇張，不守舊，不沉悶，不胡鬧。相反的，眞實，生動，沉着，緊凑。完全廢除了歐美影片一般舊的方式，而努力的創造出新的情調。例如跳舞一場不是紙醉金为而是感情的緊逼。女學生洗澡也祗是學校的素描，而不是肉感的顯示。有笑料，但不胡鬧。到處描寫壓迫力量，不厭其煩，特别是女校長的皮鞋聲，眞是描寫入微。總之，以女作作家出身而初次導演能有如此成績的萊寗莎幹（ＬｅａｌｉｎＳａｇａｎ，眞令我們偑服之至。然而最後那一場大家喊着Ｍ２ｎｕｅｌａ（一個學生的名字）的好場面，祗落得那般無力的收場，到底未免可惜。</p>
<p>至於一羣的演員們都很重要，而且都肯認眞表演，不誇張亦不偷懶，也是値得讚賞的地方。羣衆戲能夠如此，亦可見導演之手法高明。女敎員眼眶中飽含着熱涙的表演，自然是恰好的技術。···然而爲了篇幅有限，其他種種都好從略。</p>

<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>這一個空虚的劇本，牠告訴我們是這樣一個驚人（？）的故事！一個賣藝女郎和一位富家子戀愛了，富家子爲了她</p>
<p>，和原有的未婚妻解約了，達到結婚目的，甚至於富家子也曾參加賣藝團去表演。</p>
<p>但是影片中的演出！比上面所寫的，複雜到一千倍。它無意　的描寫賣藝女郎過去的歷史，甚至邇三代袓宗的事情，也佔了一千尺以上的膠片，雖然是</p>
<p>反映他們的勇敢，和不屈的精神，但是實際上終究是妄費的，當然劇本上也有不少是很正當的叙述，如寫賣藝生活的辛苦，觀衆的不給原諒，世人的重色不重藝等，比較都是切實的素描，頗能引起人同情。不過這些都是片段的，瑣碎的，瑜不掩瑕，很難給人良好印象。還有許多極無聊的動作，例如末尾，公請客串表演，當然與當事人以難堪，不過到底是否侮辱？而因此剌激再去賣藝是否値得？總之·歪曲的意識，不勝枚舉。有了較好的劇旨，而不能完整的發揮，而把紊亂無章的半新見解·拉雜加入，整個的劇本就丢失了重心。特别是全片的大歸宿，拿「再去賣藝」作爲唯一的「健美之路」的光明大道，更呌人不解！末尾提倡體育，啓發民智的偉大表演，在影片裏我也没看到！（說明書上有）　　導演比較是不壞，不過劇本太長了穿揮反述又多·一萬多尺的膠片·簡直不夠用，於是可以發展些的地方·一槪從略。小地方導演却運用了不少腦汁，所以結構上，是很可誇的，分幕的巧妙，的確在「和平之花」以上，側述對照，頗稱適當。</p>
<p>攝影也可以算稱職的，很挈忙導演來完成了工作，雖然進退，轉移，都未免呆滯，但是固定地位的鏡頭，角度配合得還不錯，遠景和外景，比較是差一些。光線失之太弱，爲這張「蛻化武俠片」是不太合宜的·所以增加了畫面的「美」而减少了影片的「力」。佈景對於賣藝塲所·稍嫌失眞，富家的窮奢極侈，和摩登化似乎過份一些。</p>
<p>字幕的句子旣深奥·又像新詩那樣的感情化，於是有不少人看不懂，即使懂，也會感到與影片中的表演，是文不對題的。</p>
<p>末尾，要談表演了，我們巳經知道這片子是「半武俠化」的，賣藝表演，佔到三分之一·再加本事這麽長，簡直是一些機會也没有來顧到表演的發展，只是大家來扮某個人做戲而巳。不過幾個主要角色，我不能不說兩句，賣藝女子是徐琴芳，素來只會武不會文的，在奕裏雖兼飾三角（一個她的祖母，一個她母親），可是除了跳高，走鋼絲以外，只有打而巳。武功却是不錯。鄭小秋作富家子，庸懦華貴有餘，而剛毅深刻不足。「他是老太太心目中的好兒子，而不是時代上的靑年」，有人這樣說，而覺得這倒是很恰當的評語。表情只是平常·的確他前半部的翩翩公子，比較是不錯，後半部好似吃力得很。飾富家翁的是嚴工上，老練沉著，恰合守舊派富翁的身份。賣藝團主人謝雲卿失之太文，不似走江湖的人，呻吟輾轉，病態支離，却很精彩，確是有火候純靑的演員。高逸安（富翁之妻）徐莘園（惡覇）也勉强作戲而巳。</p>

<h3 id="e31">Urgent Relief for the Flood Disaster <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Recent continuous plum rains have caused water levels to rise dramatically in various regions. The water level in Hankou has already reached 44 feet and 1 inch, exceeding last year's level by 1 foot and 9 inches, and even surpassing the great flood of the year before last by 5 feet and 7 inches. The provinces of Hunan and Zhejiang are also experiencing severe flooding, causing transportation disruptions. This newspaper previously published two articles on flood prevention on the 13th of this month, hoping to awaken the nation's attention through earnest appeals. Now, the water level rises daily, and the crisis intensifies. Recalling the horrific scene of the land submerged in the great flood of the year before last, and considering the danger we face today, we cannot help but tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the reason for the recent dramatic increase in water levels is due to the melting of accumulated snow in the Himalayas, with the meltwater flowing downstream. The Yangtze River lacks extensive forests to retain water, and the continuous plum rains further exacerbate the situation. Therefore, water levels along the river are rising daily. However, if we had adequate preparations for flood defenses, this gradually accumulating water would not have led to a disaster. During Zhang Zhidong's tenure as Governor-General of Huguang in the late Qing dynasty, he designated fixed annual funding for flood control projects. However, these efforts were often nominal. In recent years, not only have local governments failed to prepare in advance, but they have also misappropriated existing water conservancy funds, leading to the neglect of dike maintenance. The Jianghan Plain was originally meant to benefit the people. Now, it cannot fully exert its capacity to benefit the country and the people, nor can it be properly managed to prevent harm. The great wounds of the year before last have not yet healed, and the crisis of this year is already upon us. The surging river will become a scourge, and those responsible for protecting the dikes cannot escape blame for their negligence.</p>
<p>Historically, there have been three strategies for dealing with floods: First, "Elimination," which uses scientific methods to fundamentally eliminate floods, representing proactive construction. Second, "Prevention," which uses human effort to prevent disasters before they occur, representing passive resistance. The least desirable strategy is "Rescue," which is to take action to salvage the situation only after the disaster has already occurred. Today, our country faces a succession of natural and man-made disasters, and the people live under constant threat. "Elimination" is out of the question, while "Prevention" and "Rescue" should be implemented simultaneously without delay. In essence, areas that have not yet been hit by disasters, such as the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, should quickly engage in prevention. For areas that have already been affected, relief efforts should be organized promptly. Government authorities should quickly establish a disaster prevention committee to supervise local governments and responsible agencies, prohibiting shirking responsibility or retreating. All parties should cooperate to the best of their abilities. Charitable organizations and the wealthy nationwide should also contribute their efforts to assist in the effort before the disaster expands, preventing the elderly and weak from wandering as refugees and the young and strong from being displaced, which would severely harm the nation's vitality. We hope that the entire country, both government and the public, will concentrate our efforts and jointly undertake this final task.</p>
<p>The total loss from the flood of the year before last reached two billion yuan, with indirect losses being incalculable. If we close our eyes and imagine, if these funds had been used for afforestation, river dredging, and dike construction, there would be nothing that could not have been done. Even if a portion had been used for construction and another portion had been used for disaster relief, the unprecedented disaster of the past few decades would not have occurred. Instead, the entire country shirked responsibility, watching as the water level rose day by day, with white waves carrying devastation. Only after the disaster occurred did we organize relief agencies in a frantic and hasty manner. Meanwhile, the national economy and the people's livelihoods have suffered irreparable losses. One such calamity is already too much. Now, the wounds have not yet healed, and we cannot allow another knife to be added to the pain. Our government and our people must quickly rise up to rescue ourselves and others, for we are now facing the ultimate crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e32">The Future of the World Economic Conference Still Faces Many Hidden Reefs <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Roosevelt's advisor crosses the Atlantic with new instructions; the attitude of the American delegation will become more rigid. The issue of currency stabilization hinders the progress of the conference. The Russian representative proposes a draft of an economic non-aggression pact. (Washington) As a result of President Roosevelt's trusted advisor, Professor Moley, being ordered to visit Europe, the attitude of the United States at the World Economic Conference may become more rigid and less flexible. Members of Congress still in Washington believe that the situation at the Economic Conference is serious. However, while opposition to France is strong, there are also many who criticize the American delegation for being indecisive. Many are deeply concerned about the possibility of France withdrawing from the conference. Officials here claim that France and other countries using the gold standard are overemphasizing currency stabilization. Although the influential countries attending the conference advocate for extending the conference, the American delegation will tacitly agree. However, the conference should continue to work. President Roosevelt stated today that he is determined to raise prices in the United States and worldwide to achieve his plan. His government now believes that it is time to consult with other countries and assures them that everything will proceed according to the American domestic recovery program, especially price increases, extensive public works, and the expansion of lending by central banks. If other countries do not cooperate, President Roosevelt believes that the United States will proceed alone. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Recent rumors that American Secretary of State Hull will return to the United States have shaken the position of the American delegation. To stabilize its position, Hull may stay in England more often during the conference. According to the original plan, Hull would only stay in London during the initial stages of the conference. The American delegation is currently observing and waiting for Professor Moley to arrive in England. It is expected that Moley's instructions from the American President will urge the American delegation to proceed with a closed-door program. Negotiations on currency stabilization are currently stalled. It is feared that the conference will not be able to reach a concrete agreement on a permanent stabilization method. However, some of the original hopes for currency stabilization may be realized. The more optimistic members of the American delegation believe that before the conference closes, a system where 25% of banknotes are backed by gold, with 80% of that being gold, or some form of stabilization, can be established. The American delegation seems more united than before after yesterday's meeting and Hull's declaration that they are absolutely united. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources here, the American President's new instructions to the American delegation will include an early plan to stabilize the gold-dollar and gold-pound exchange rates at around $4.40 or $4.50, leaving sufficient room for the American currency expansion plan to achieve the desired results domestically. This information came out this evening after a fierce attack on American policy by the French delegation. The fact that the United States has remained silent on financial and economic short-term solutions at the conference has surprised many here. It is believed that the American President's nationalistic economic policy conflicts with the internationalism of the conference. Therefore, the United States has only put forward one resolution by Pittman, while Kuhn, Morrison, MacLeish, and others on the monetary stabilization subcommittee and the economic committee have remained completely silent. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American Treasury Department stated in a formal statement today that the American government, having offered a permanent currency stabilization plan to the Economic Conference, will let it proceed naturally and will no longer force its adoption or urge early currency stabilization. The same attitude will be taken towards the gold dollar, allowing it to rise and fall freely in the market. Some European financiers believe that for the sake of international trade, the exchange market should be artificially managed. The American Treasury Department does not agree. Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson stated that it is precisely because the exchange market is currently subject to artificial manipulation that the United States suddenly took a position of pegging the dollar, which had an adverse impact on the British pound. Acheson did not express any particular concern about the situation in the exchange market, except to say that the American plan is being discussed in London. He said that as far as he knows, the situation in London is still the same as last week. The United States rejected the European proposal, and the European representatives felt the danger of the American plan. It was also said that if the representatives of the countries cannot agree on a definite way to manage the currency in London, they can conclude a gentleman's agreement as a tool to achieve a final solution. It was also expressed that the American government welcomes countries to express opposition or support for the American plan when discussing exchange rates, so that some kind of solution can be expected.

<p>There is talk that he will replace Hull as Chief Delegate. (New York) Undersecretary of State Professor Moley specially asked President Roosevelt for instructions before departing for England. He took a plane from here and then transferred to a ship to visit the President on the yacht "Amberjack" and reported on the recent developments of the World Economic Conference. The meeting lasted for an hour. Moley then returned here by plane and warship. The President's secretary recently issued an announcement stating, "Moley, at the request of the President, is scheduled to depart for London tomorrow to inform the delegates of the domestic situation since the delegation left the United States, especially the discussions in Congress, in his capacity as liaison between the President and the American delegation. Moley will stay in London for about a week and then return to the country to report to the President on detailed information about the Economic Conference. Today, he presented a detailed report on the London Economic Conference after the President left Washington. After listening to Moley's report, the President will give him final instructions." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The American Chief Delegate Hull stated today that the actions of the American delegation attending the World Economic Conference are often misunderstood, and the American delegation spends a lot of time correcting these false impressions. He will not be able to announce whether he will return to the United States until the President's trusted advisor, Professor Moley, arrives in London. Moley is known for advocating isolationism, while Hull is known as an internationalist. Senator Coulson said yesterday that the United States must choose between a national program and an international program, so it is noteworthy that Moley may replace Hull as the Chief Delegate.

<p>(London) The World Economic Conference is divided into many categories and branches. The conference specially issued a system chart today to guide the representatives and experts. The conference is divided into two major committees, and these two major committees are divided into subcommittees, shareholders' committees, and special shareholders' committees, so that the committee members who have been elected to serve almost do not know which organization they belong to.

<p>(London) This morning's meeting involved many events, one of the most important of which was the presentation of the Russian delegation's draft of an economic non-aggression pact. Russian representative Litvinov mentioned the British ban on Russian goods during the general discussion at the conference, arguing that countries should immediately stop the current plan of economic warfare. Now, he has drafted a draft and submitted it to the conference. The conference immediately referred this draft to a special shareholders' committee for review. Event C in the agenda of the Economic Committee, such as the issue of plant diseases, made people speechless. There were few speakers, so the chairman proposed an item, which was public works.

<p>(London) Today, Litvinov sent the draft of the economic non-aggression pact proposed by the Soviet Union to the World Economic Conference. Its content is as follows: "The governments of the following countries recognize that the cessation of economic aggression is the primary condition for countries, regardless of their political and economic systems, to seek peaceful cooperation in their mutual economic relations. They firmly believe that the cessation of economic aggression will help eliminate the atmosphere of mutual suspicion and fear and consider that if countries want to improve the current serious economic situation, in addition to avoiding war as a way to resolve international disputes, they must abolish all forms of economic aggression. Therefore, the governments of all countries agree to the following points: The contracting parties declare that in their policies, they will abide by the principles declared by the 1927 International Economic Conference and confirmed by the 1931 Special Committee for the Study of the European Federation, regarding the peaceful coexistence of all countries regardless of their social, political, and economic systems. Therefore, the contracting parties agree to eliminate all forms of differential treatment that exist in their mutual relations." The draft lists examples of various forms of differential treatment and stipulates that the signatory countries should immediately eliminate the existing differential treatment measures between the countries after the draft is approved.

<p>(London) France today fiercely attacked the American monetary policy in the Monetary Stabilization Subcommittee. The French Minister of Finance Bonnet, speaking with obvious displeasure, looked directly at the American representative Kuhn and declared that the world's problems cannot have a lasting solution until the currency is stabilized. We need practical actions. Please, Mr. Kuhn, do not sign a piece of waste paper that has not been thought through. How can we restore the trust of others if we cannot free the national economic life from the grasp of speculators? Without political, economic, and monetary security, there can be no lasting recovery of the economy. If the Economic Conference cannot make progress in these three areas, it will undoubtedly fail completely. Finally, he said that countries must now explain their views, but they should not allow the distinction between gold standard countries and non-gold standard countries to prevent cooperation. This statement was clearly directed at the United States. Later, the Italian representative Pontus said that the Italian government was shocked to hear that the world was divided into two types of countries, stable gold coins and unstable gold coins. This is no different from an attack on world unity and world trade and may lead to serious political consequences. The Governor of the Swiss National Bank, Bachmann, strongly urged the meeting to agree in principle to the universal restoration of the gold standard before proceeding with other issues. The United States and Britain should first restore the gold standard and lead other countries to a stable path.</p>
<p>Today, the Stabilization Subcommittee continued to discuss the plan of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, who advocated that the whole world adopt a low-cost currency and a generous credit policy. Among them, the Japanese representative Tsushima expressed acceptance in principle of the need to restore the stability of costs and production, but suggested that the wording of Chamberlain's resolution be modified because it was feared that the original proposal would encourage currency expansion.

<p>It is now learned that one part of the proposal of the American representative Senator Pittman, which was passed by the Currency Committee this morning, is a statement advocating that international currency stability must be found quickly, and at the same time, the international standard of exchanging value for gold should be restored. As for the remaining parts of the proposal, they have been referred to the silver shareholders' committee of the Currency Committee. According to the official news of the American delegation, Pittman's proposal, although submitted in the name of the entire American delegation and with the endorsement of President Roosevelt, was submitted with the understanding that the proposal would still be modified or reserved. This case is the result of weeks of discussions among representatives of governments in Washington. The American delegation today expressed the hope that the governments of all countries can cooperate as soon as possible to establish an agreement based on the principles in this case.

<p>Discussion of Production and Marketing Issues Transferred to the Subcommittee for Review</p>
<p>(London) Today, the Economic Committee began to discuss issues such as direct and indirect trade subsidies, export bonuses, and regulations on marking the place of origin. The section on the organization of production and marketing has been discussed and transferred to the subcommittee. Chairman Coline recommended Argentine representative Lebreton as the chairman of the overall adjustment subcommittee for production and marketing, and appointed representatives from Germany, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Cuba, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, Ireland, the United States, France, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Sweden, and the Huang Empire as members.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of trade subsidies, Norwegian representative Feinlai requested that shipping subsidies be abolished immediately or gradually, with only a few necessary ones such as mail contracts being excluded.</p>
<p>(London) Australian representative Bruce made a frank speech in the Economic Committee today, saying that some people regard limiting production as a plan to solve economic difficulties. In Australia, this seems to be an unacceptable and terrible policy. As soon as his words were spoken, applause followed. Bruce also said that the great goal should be to increase the world's purchasing power, but he knows that it may be necessary to temporarily control certain goods. Australia is prepared to deal with it. Chairman Coline of the Economic Committee stated today that the subcommittee studying whether to limit production will take the wheat issue as its main task.

More strangely, this case was presented by the British Secretary of Commerce, Rensiman, but Rensiman did not participate in the discussion today. This case was only discussed for half an hour. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The Economic Committee discussed the issue of subsidies this morning. Some delegations believe that the state's subsidies to shipping companies and certain public works have become a restriction on commerce and should be equated with protection policies. Norwegian representative Balata advocated abolishing such subsidies and requested the establishment of a subcommittee to prepare a convention that would abolish all or part of the maritime subsidies, except for postal and passenger subsidies that are essential in practice. Balata strongly opposed state intervention in shipping enterprises, saying that this is one of the main reasons for the panic in freight rates. The Italian representative requested that the subsidy issue be submitted to the commercial and political subcommittee for discussion, but the Economic Committee finally passed the proposal of the Norwegian representative and organized another subcommittee to discuss it.

<p>(Tokyo) The tariff truce is currently under consideration by the Privy Council. It is reported that Japan's formal approval of the tariff truce will be accompanied by the following self-defense reservations: ㈠ Japan reserves the right to immediately withdraw from the truce agreement if a signatory country that has a close relationship with Japan implements any plan that undermines the spirit of the truce. ㈡ Japan reserves the right to automatically implement its tariff policy. This is necessary to protect its commercial interests against signatory or non-signatory countries that have taken or will take measures that damage international commerce. The authorities claim that Japan's tariffs have not been raised in the past twenty years, so its tax rate is lower than that of any country. Japan also does not want to implement any tariff plan before the World Economic Conference is held. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) European countries, South Feiji, Cuba, and Venezuela have now complied with the tariff truce.

<p>㈠ Regarding matters related to China's new tariff law and anti-dumping tax, although it wants to continue to protest, there is no treaty basis, and there is no need to be pessimistic about the future of Sino-Japanese relations, so it is appropriate to take a wait-and-see policy for the time being.</p>
<p>㈡ Please extend the country-of-origin marking law for another two years. If the boycott of Japanese goods movement is cancelled, then it can be ordered to clearly mark the country of origin. Please have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs actively negotiate this matter.</p>
<p>㈢ Regarding the issue of trade between Japan and India, we hope that the government will proceed with the signing of a new agreement as soon as possible. It is hoped that the new agreement can be established before the expiration of the old agreement in October. (China United Press, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e50">French Trade Deficit <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) France's import and export trade has been increasingly unfavorable in recent years, causing considerable anxiety among authorities. From the 1st to the end of the 5th of this year, French exports have decreased by as much as 100 million francs or 12 million pounds compared to the same period last year. Imports, however, have not decreased. The total import value for the first five months of this year was 1.27 billion francs, roughly equivalent to the 1.2682 billion francs for the same period last year. However, the total export value for the first five months of this year was 755 million francs, a decrease of 100 million francs compared to last year's 855 million francs. As a result, the trade deficit is approximately 515 million francs, or 6.4 million pounds, while the trade deficit for the same period last year was 418.2 million francs, or 5.25 million pounds. Furthermore, previous trade losses could be offset by the large expenditures of tourists, but the number of tourists visiting France in the past two years has significantly decreased. Therefore, there is no solution for how to compensate for this, and it is certain to affect France's monetary system. (20th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Must Work Hard, Practically, and Quickly (Nanchang) Chairman Chiang's address at the County Magistrate Conference on the 19th was roughly as follows: The Red scourge in Jiangxi Province is rampant and must be dealt with using special methods and a special spirit to handle the political affairs of special regions. With the patience of correcting disorder and the desire to save lives, quell the disaster in Jiangxi. Do not be peaceful county magistrates, but be county magistrates who endure hardship, toil, and bear grievances. Because the situation in Jiangxi is special, there is only governing people, not governing laws. It is useless to merely quibble over laws and regulations. One must adapt to local conditions, adapt to the times, and respond flexibly to changing circumstances. I grant you the authority to adapt to local conditions and adapt to the times, but you must have a sense of responsibility and be loyal to your duties. If county magistrates encounter emergency situations, they may use the name of military consolation officers, but they must not abuse this name casually. Also, if county magistrates encounter party members who are naive, incompetent, and do not work hard, they may handle them expediently. We must work hard, practically, and quickly. "Hard" is equivalent to "strict." When handling affairs in times of chaos, one must be strict. You must use the heart of a Bodhisattva to engage in strict actions. "Quick" means agile, and "practical" means diligent. I hope all county magistrates must achieve this. Furthermore, the most important thing in current politics is militarization, and you must also pay attention to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame.

<p>Very Much in Line with the Principle of Utilizing Foreign Capital (Nanjing) The Executive Yuan (Zhengyuan) (Central Political Council) at its meeting on the 21st approved the case of the Henan Central Company and the Fuk Company jointly operating a coal mine. The key points of the contract are as follows: (1) The two companies will adopt a joint sales method, establishing a Sino-Fuk Company joint office for joint operations. Everything can be reorganized into a joint-stock company. (2) The duration of the joint venture is set at ten years, which can be extended according to law upon application. (3) The capital is set at one million yuan, with the Henan Central Company contributing 510,000 yuan and the Fuk Company contributing 490,000 yuan. (4) There will be three directors from the Henan Central Company and two directors from the Fuk Company. The chairman of the board will be mutually elected by the Henan Central Company directors, and the general manager will be recommended by the Henan Central Company. (5) The assets of the two companies will still be managed separately, but the right to use them will belong to the joint office. (6) Before the establishment of the joint office, all creditor's rights, debts, and external contracts of both parties will still be managed separately, but unexpired contracts in operation will be taken over by the joint office. According to a certain member of the Central Committee speaking to reporters, the joint venture between the two companies to operate a coal mine is very much in line with the principle of utilizing foreign capital and is more favorable than the contracts signed by the Eurasia and China Airlines companies with Germany and the United States. Therefore, the Central Political Council decided to approve the record. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

As for the overall situation, the Dalai Lama is also quite concerned about the conflict between Qinghai and Tibet. Since the conflict between Qinghai and Tibet has been resolved peacefully due to the peace agreement, the dispute between Kang and Tibet also focuses on peaceful resolution. The rumor that the Tibetan side is increasing troops on the Qinghai border and that the Tibetan troops are about to attack Xikang may not be entirely true. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e87">Siamese Revolution Completed Overnight <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Radical Party, United with the Navy and Army, Occupies the Capital Silently. The Conservative Government is Overthrown. National News Agency's Bangkok Dispatch on the 21st: Siamese radicals, taking advantage of the King's absence from the capital this morning, and with the help of naval and army personnel, suddenly occupied the capital and arrested conservative leaders. Before the King returns to the capital, the government is temporarily managed by military leaders. This bloodless revolution is like the revolution of June 24th last year, without firing a shot or injuring anyone. Colonel Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena, the Army Commander-in-Chief, resigned yesterday. After midnight, he suddenly led troops to surround the Royal Palace and arrested Prince Manopakon Nitithat, the President of the State Council, Phraya Sri Sena, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Phraya Thepharit Phanuphandhu, the Minister of Defense. Later, Prince Manopakon Nitithat resigned and was temporarily replaced by Colonel Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena, awaiting the King's return from the Huai Hin Summer Palace for disposition. The most recent cause of the revolution was that the State Council failed to adopt the radical economic plan proposed by the former Chairman, Pridi Banomyong, two months ago. Subsequently, the State Council and the National Assembly were accused of having communist inclinations and were dissolved on April 1st, and the power was completely taken over by conservatives who formed another State Council with Prince Manopakon Nitithat as its head. Pridi Banomyong immediately fled to Europe, and the radicals secretly conspired with Colonel Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena to launch a revolution, which lasted fifty days, resulting in today's uprising. Pridi and Phraya were both leaders of the revolution of June last year. Today's revolution was not only bloodless, but also completely silent. The Navy and Army had secretly made thorough arrangements. Upon a command, they immediately quietly marched to the designated locations. The people initially heard nothing. When they woke up this morning, they suddenly saw troops surrounding the government offices and realized that the government had undergone another change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, observing the situation of the revolution, one gets the impression that the Siamese King knew about it in advance and used the excuse of going to the Huai Hin Summer Palace. However, in any case, it is expected that the Siamese King will certainly comply with the requests of the radicals, issue new orders, and implement new measures. However, the extensive powers granted to him by the constitution are likely to be slightly reduced after this revolution. As for the conservatives, it is unlikely that they will be able to carry out a resistance movement. It is expected that those arrested will be released as civilians after things are settled.</p>
<p>National News Agency's Bangkok Dispatch on the 21st: Colonel Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena, the temporary dictator of Siam, has asked the King on behalf of the radicals to immediately convene the National Assembly and the State Council dissolved on April 1st and to reinstate Pridi Banomyong and other radicals who were dismissed at the same time. Pridi is currently in France, but the radicals all want him to return to the country and take charge of the government. It is said that if Pridi's faction can regain power and implement its radical plan to help farmers, then Pridi will immediately return to Siam. However, Pridi himself may not want to serve as Chairman of the State Council again. According to a radical leader today, Pridi does not want to be an official, but only wants to see his economic plan effectively implemented. As for his plan, it is a compromise between democracy and communism. Currently, Bangkok is peaceful and stable. Only naval and army soldiers are patrolling the streets. Newspapers and telegrams are all subject to strict inspection.</p>
<p>Bangkok Dispatch on the 21st: Yesterday's coup was peaceful. It was merely a change in the government's leadership and had nothing to do with the Siamese King's position. The one in charge this time was Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena, the Commander-in-Chief of the Siamese Navy and Army. Phraya had previously carried out the first revolution, limiting the authority of the Siamese King. This time, he overthrew the old Executive Council and announced that he would convene a people's assembly to conform to the constitution. At the same time, he telegraphed the Siamese King, who was taking a summer retreat in Huai Hin, informing him that the Navy, Army, and people supported the King, so they took this action, the purpose of which was to reorganize the Executive Council. The current Siamese King, now thirty-nine years old, ascended the throne in 1925. After the political system was changed to a constitutional monarchy last year, a provisional constitution was promulgated in June, stipulating that the supreme power belonged to the people and that the monarch was the head of state. The executive power was exercised by a fifteen-member committee. It also stipulated that a parliament should be convened, consisting of seventy members, half appointed and half elected. This year, the Siamese King dissolved parliament in April on the pretext of preventing the spread of communism and established another Executive Council to await the election of a new parliament. Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena advocated the immediate convening of parliament and was dissatisfied with this transitional arrangement, so there was a second revolution today.</p>

<p>Reuters' New York Dispatch on the 21st: Today, various New York banks telegraphed Dr. Schacht, the President of the Deutsche Bank, stating that the method of suspending all debts owed to Germany before July 1931 was inappropriate, unfair, and harmful to Germany's credit. The suspension order was announced on June 8th. According to Schacht, the reason for this move was entirely due to the current financial panic in Germany, and the reason for this panic was caused by the banking crisis in 1931. The suspension order affects the principal and interest of German debt amounting to 865,000,000 pounds.</p>

Unexpectedly, the floods are torrential and are coming even more fiercely. On the 20th, the water level rose sharply by one foot in one day, reaching 44 feet and one inch, which is five feet and seven inches higher than the water level of 38 feet and four inches on the same day in the 20th year (of the Republic) and more than one zhang higher than the water level of 33 feet and two inches in the 21st year.

<p>Reuter, Berlin, 21st: Goering's secret police, with the assistance of the armed Storm Troopers, attacked the offices of Hugenberg's National Socialist Party, occupying its headquarters and branches, and confiscating all its assets and uniforms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was discovered upon inspection that there were leaks in the newly constructed embankment foundation from last year. An immediate order was issued to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the Department of Construction, and the Wuchang County Government to quickly work together to plug the leaks. The provincial government was instructed to supervise the progress. At the same time, cracks appeared in the Jiang embankment along Kuaizi Street, Huo Xiang Pier, and Dingjia Pier. The provincial government ordered workers to plug the leaks to prevent danger. Arrangements were being made when the Jinshui New Dam, which is of extreme importance, suddenly collapsed. Zhang Haizi, the Magistrate of Wuchang County, urgently telegraphed the provincial government, stating: "Urgent, to Xia Jun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, according to a telegram from Cao Yunfeng, the District Chief of the Tenth District under the County, at 10:00 AM today, while urgently repairing the Jinshui New Dam, the dam suddenly collapsed, and the Yangtze River flooded in an overwhelming torrent. At that time, seven or eight workers were killed, and all previous efforts were in vain, turning everything into a watery kingdom. We have reported this matter urgently for your consideration and approval. In addition to personally inspecting the situation and notifying the relevant authorities, we respectfully submit this telegram, requesting your attention. Zhang Haizi, Magistrate of Wuchang County, bows and salutes." The Jinshui Dam is related to the safety of several counties in southern Hubei, such as Jiayu and Puqi. Once it collapses, countless thousands of people will be buried in the bellies of fish.</p>

<p>Since the flood of the 20th year of the Republic, Hankou has built sturdy flood control embankments along the river. However, construction in the Japanese concession was delayed. During this flood, the Japanese concession, due to its low-lying terrain, was the first to be flooded by the river on the 20th, with the riverside roads and sidewalks submerged. The water along the river in the Chinese district, the Special District, and the French Concession was almost level with the bank. All underground passages and toilets were flooded. In addition to sealing off all sewers, the municipal government dispatched workers on the 20th to completely board up and seal all flood control embankment gates along the river with earth. Furthermore, a comprehensive plan was decided for the flood control works around the Houhu area. The city was divided into five sections: (1) From Qiaokou to the Water Plant, to be managed by the Wai Wu Jia and Gu Cha An Security Committees; (2) From Fen Jin Lu to Chen Jia Ji, to be managed by the Public Security Bureau; (3) The southern section of the Changfeng Embankment, to be managed by the Embankment Works Committee; (4) The northern section of the Changfeng Embankment and the Zhanggong Embankment, to be managed jointly by the Fourth District Farmers' Association, related farmers' associations, and the Gusaoshu Security Committee; (5) The Daijiashan Embankment Gate, to be managed after inspection by officials sent by the municipal government. Among these, the Zhanggong Embankment is of the greatest importance. Mayor Wu Guozhen personally inspected it on the 20th and instructed the embankment guards to take their protective duties seriously. Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, Zhu Jiuying, Secretary of the Headquarters, Yang Dinghua, Councilor, Xi Keng, and Zhang Chongji, specialists from the National Economic Council, also inspected the embankment one after another, but no danger was discovered.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Various Counties <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Of the sixty-nine counties in Hubei Province, thirty-five are located along the Yangtze and Han Rivers. This time, Qichun was the first to be affected by the breach of the embankment, becoming a disaster area. Wuchang, Jiayu, and other counties were also affected by the collapse of the Jinshui Dam. The situation in other counties is also precarious. At a meeting on the 20th, the provincial government decided to appoint the magistrates of twenty-four counties in the Yangtze River Basin—Huangmei, Guangji, Qichun, Yangxin, Qishui, Daye, Echeng, Huanggang, Wuchang, Huangpi, Hanyang, Jiayu, Xianning, Puqi, Mianyang, Jianli, Shishou, Gongan, Jiangling, Songzi, Zhijiang, Yidu, and Yichang—and the magistrates of twelve counties in the Xiang River Basin—Hanchuan, Xiaogan, Yunmeng, Yingcheng, Tianmen, Qianjiang, Jingshan, Jingmen, Zhongxiang, Yicheng, Xiangyang, and Guanghua—as flood prevention committee members. A telegraphic order was sent instructing them to supervise the district and village chiefs to gather civilian workers and direct them to work according to the flood prevention and emergency rescue plans of the Public Works Bureau. Yang Shengyi, Yuan Shengwu, Wu Songqiao, Chen Zerong, Xiang Dao, and Pan Huigen were appointed as flood prevention inspectors for various regions. They departed on separate routes immediately. The stipends for the flood prevention committee members were thirty yuan per month, and the stipends for the inspectors were two hundred yuan per month. Travel expenses were forty yuan per month, all to be paid from the flood prevention funds. The flood prevention conference convened by the Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee, scheduled to open in Nanjing on the 22nd, was attended by Li Fanyi, Director of the Department of Construction, who was officially recommended by the provincial government. Li departed eastward on the Jianguo Wheel on the evening of the 20th. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Feng Yuxiang Urges Song Zheyuan to Return to Chahar <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jiyong and Others Go to See Zhang Again to Meet with Feng, Difficulties in Disposing of Fang Zhenwu's Troops. Special Correspondence from Beiping: Regarding the Chahar issue, all eyes are focused on Feng Yuxiang's attitude. The central government has decided to appoint Feng as the National Forest and Land Reclamation Supervisor. It is also rumored that Feng, during Zhang Jiyong's previous visit on behalf of Song Zheyuan, was quite understanding of Song's mediation. Therefore, although the central government did not express its earnest intentions regarding the nominal title, it had tacitly agreed that he could take on the position of Forest and Land Reclamation Supervisor. Because of the proposal of seven measures, the key figures believed that Feng could eliminate internal dissent and were very pleased. They telegraphed the central government in detail, stating Feng's true attitude and unanimously believing that the Chahar issue could be resolved. The surrounding atmosphere was optimistic. On the day of the establishment of the Political Affairs Committee, the order for Song to return to Chahar was first announced, and there was even talk that Feng had agreed to take on the position of Forest and Land Reclamation Supervisor. According to investigations, this matter is still under discussion between the parties. It is not yet known whether Feng will cancel his title as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Army, and even if the new order from the central government is issued, there is no fixed date for Feng to take office. However, Song's return to Chahar is what Feng deeply desires. If the Chahar provincial government is entrusted to Song, then no complications should arise, it can be asserted. Last night (the 19th) at 10:00 PM, Song visited He Yingqin at Jurentang to ask for instructions. He Yingqin believed that if Feng could cancel his current title and the central government appointed him as the Forest and Land Reclamation Supervisor, it would definitely make it happen in a short period of time. Feng telegraphed Beiping twice last night, hoping that Song would return to Chahar immediately to preside over provincial affairs, expressing his warm welcome in the telegram. At the same time, Tong Linge also telegraphed Song, saying that the Chahar provincial government affairs were only temporarily handled by him as an agent, everything was as usual, and he asked him to come to Chahar to discuss national affairs with Mr. Feng. The handover matters for the Chahar provincial government have been properly handled and are awaiting acceptance. Song believed that he still had to go to Guanyintang and other places in the coming days to inspect the troops stationed there. Moreover, the various units had participated in the war of resistance against Japan and suffered heavy casualties. The rest and replenishment still needed to be taken care of one by one. It was necessary to arrange everything properly before he could go to Chahar. Therefore, this morning (the 20th) at a little after 9:00 AM, he gathered Zhang Jiyong, Deng Zhexi, Lei Jishang, Ge Dingyuan, Zhang Weifan, and others again at his residence in Wuyiku to discuss everything. The central government hopes that Feng will temporarily leave Zhangjiakou and move to Wanquan County, thirty miles from Zhangjiakou, so that Song can concentrate on reorganizing government affairs upon his return to Chahar. Or, after the title of Forest and Land Reclamation Supervisor is announced, that place can be the site of the Supervisor's office. However, it is not known whether Feng can accept this one by one. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to send Zhang Jiyong and Lei Jishang again to Zhangjiakou to convey the intentions of the central government, explain the measures to solve the current situation, and seek Feng's consent. After Zhang and others return to Beiping, Song will set a date to return to Chahar, while his troops will be dispatched later. Zhang and others originally planned to set off for Zhangjiakou yesterday, but because the negotiations were not settled, they changed to set off tomorrow (the 21st). As for the various volunteer armies in Chahar, as well as the troops of Ji Hongchang and Tong Linge, they will all be under Song's command and reorganized. There was a previous proposal to appoint Fang Zhenwu as the Deputy Director of Forest and Land Reclamation, but Fang did not want to leave his troops. Now there is also talk of appointing him as the Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression. Fang's troops are still in the vicinity of Zhangjiakou, and how to resolve this requires overcoming some difficulties. As for the candidates for the reorganized Chahar provincial government, Song will recommend them to the central government by telegram. Generally, the Director of Finance will be Guo Zhihan, the Director of Education will be Zheng Dayu or Ge Dingyuan, and there is a proposal to choose one of Zhang Jiyong and Zhang Weifan to serve as the Director of Construction. Also, the rebel army in eastern Chahar has recently been inactive. The Japanese army has a hesitant attitude towards Chahar. How it will change cannot be predicted. (June 20th)</p>

<p>The Second Battalion of the Third Security Regiment Arrives in Song: The Second Regiment of the original stationed security forces in Songjiang County was ordered to go to northern Jiangsu to suppress bandits last year. The local defense was first taken over by the Sixth Company of the Second Battalion of the Third Regiment, which was sent to Songjiang to garrison and maintain order.

<p>The Yongning steamer of the Nanhai Company on the north bank of the Yong River in Ningbo left Ningbo at 9:00 AM on the 16th and set sail for Taizhou and Wenzhou. When passing Zhenhai, five water police officers from the Second Brigade of the Zhenhai Water Police escorted five thieves to Taiwan on the same ship. The water police officers were unarmed, without any firearms. Unexpectedly, five bandits suddenly emerged inside the ship when the ship arrived at the sea outside Shanmen near Shipu. Seeing the situation was not good, the water police officers immediately hid in the lower cabin and disguised themselves as waiters. A bandit saw Chen Jiucheng, the navigation police officer of the ship, and immediately opened fire, wounding Chen and knocking him to the ground. The thieves then searched Chen's room and took a pistol hidden there. The remaining thieves went to the fire cabin and used iron cones to break and release the handcuffs and shackles of the thieves being escorted. These criminals also jointly searched and robbed. For five hours, no passenger on the entire ship was spared. After the robbery, they forced the driver to sail to the sea off Shichang and anchor. Several pirate ships were already prepared there, and they shouted and went ashore to land at Shichang. The losses this time were about three or four thousand yuan from the ship's account room and about four or five thousand yuan from the passengers.</p>

<p>Lake Bandits Continuously Rob and Kidnap: Gengshang Village in Jiaozhi Township on the border of Suzhou and Kunshan was approached by a pirate ship from Yangcheng Lake at noon yesterday (the 21st), carrying more than ten bandits armed with pistols and box cannons. After landing, they rushed to the home of Chen Wenqing, a villager, and looted at will, injuring Chen's wife, Sun, in the lower body with the muzzle of a gun. Before leaving, they also kidnapped Chen Wenqing. They then went to the home of a Zhao family in the neighboring village of Wangjiabang and robbed them, stealing about two hundred yuan in silver and clothing. The total loss in both places was more than six hundred yuan. After the robbery, they boarded the boat and fled towards Yangcheng Lake. The victims immediately reported to the water and land police teams, asking them to rescue the hostages and pursue the stolen goods and thieves.</p>

<p>Cocoon Boat Robbed Mid-Journey: Lu Jun, the owner of the Fulun Cocoon Firm in Hutangqiao, Wuyi County, bought dry cocoons from the Houfeng Silk Factory in Wuxi. On the morning of the 20th, he loaded thirty-six bales of dry cocoons onto a boat from Zhoujiaxiang and set off to return to the firm. Unexpectedly, when they reached Sheqiaotou, it was about 10:00 PM, and seven or eight thugs suddenly arrived on a small boat and blocked the boat, not allowing it to leave. At that time, there was only one cargo escort and one worker on the boat, and they could not resist. They had no choice but to let the ship be robbed. Fortunately, the worker saw that the situation was bad and braved to swim away to report back. The firm owner, Lu Jun, immediately reported to the county government's detective team to arrest the perpetrators. As for the cargo escort, his whereabouts are still unknown.</p>

<p>Clash Between Villagers and Police: A major clash between villagers and police occurred in the city on the 20th. The villagers opposed the Public Security Bureau's restrictions on where they could sell vegetables and the collection of vegetable donations and new scale fees, and they refused to come to the city to sell vegetables and transport manure. At noon, hundreds of people crowded into the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau and destroyed part of it. In the afternoon, the crowd grew larger and larger and even went along the street to demand new scales from various shops, gathering in front of the county government building and setting them on fire with kerosene. The order of the entire city was in chaos. The county government sent police teams to suppress the unrest and issued a notice allowing villagers to sell vegetables as before and prohibiting the collection of donations, but the villagers were still shouting in the streets. Wang Da and three others were arrested for assault on the spot. The unrest expanded, and County Magistrate Ye convened the heads of various townships and ordered them to dissuade the villagers, but it was still ineffective. Martial law was declared in the city and suburbs.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province Permits Rice and Wheat to Leave the Province: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the recent low prices of rice and wheat and the ample reserves in warehouses, has issued a special order to lift the ban on the transportation of rice and wheat out of the province. The text reads: "It has been found that the free circulation of rice and wheat for mutual adjustment within the country is the principle. Jiangsu Province, due to the floods followed by the war, allowed excessive free circulation and exports, fearing that it would cause panic regarding the people's food supply in the province. Therefore, the Provincial Government Committee decided last year that the sale of rice and wheat out of the province still required a passport issued by the Provincial Government. This was a temporary emergency measure. After its implementation, the source of rice and wheat became increasingly smooth. Now that the price of rice is still low and the reserves in warehouses are sufficient, the normal state should be restored. The Provincial Government Committee has decided that from now on, rice and wheat from this province that are transported to various provinces and cities in the country for sale shall be allowed to be transported freely without the need for the county to apply to the Provincial Government for a passport, in order to facilitate adjustment. Let all counties be informed."</p>

<p>The Municipal Federation Held a Representative Conference in the Afternoon and Resolved to Request the Municipal Government to Investigate the Director of the Police Station: Shops in the area of North Sichuan Road that was built beyond the boundary had been on strike because merchants were arrested for refusing to pay property taxes. Yu Qiaqing and others went to persuade them, and the shops all reopened yesterday afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e108">Notice of Opening <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Citizens, because the municipal government has earnestly promised to temporarily postpone the collection of property taxes in the area, issued a notice to the shops in the area yesterday morning, stating: "Notice: The incident of the Fifth District, Second Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arresting four shop assistants and detaining them in the detention center for three days, cutting off their meals, is extremely illegal, resulting in a strike. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Supervisor of the Municipal Federation of Citizens, Mr. Hu Fengxiang, Standing Committee Member, and others went to the municipal government to negotiate. Secretary-General Yu received them and explained that the property tax issue is not guaranteed until the extraterritorial road construction is recovered and resolved. It was decided not to send personnel to collect taxes again, and to ask the citizens to explain. Regarding the punishment of illegal arrests, another case will be handled. The Federation believes that the result is satisfactory. We hope that the shops will reopen today (i.e., yesterday) to maintain their original attitude. This is what we hope for."</p>
<h3 id="e109">Reopening After Persuasion <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The First Special District Municipal Federation of Citizens, fearing that the situation would escalate, sent Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Supervisor, Mr. Hu Fengxiang, Standing Committee Member, Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Liu Zhongying, Executive Committee Member, and others, seven people in total, along with Shang Weilongxuan, the head of the 25th District Branch of the Federation, at 11:00 AM yesterday to persuade the shops to reopen. The car had a white cloth flag in front with the words "Municipal Federation of Citizens Persuading to Reopen". When they reached the iron fence at the intersection of North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, and South Lao Bazi Road, Chen Jiufeng and more than 40 others from the 25th District Branch of the Federation held white cloth flags with the words "Satisfactory Resolution, Please Reopen Immediately" and accompanied them. When passing Bazi Road, they immediately persuaded the shops to open their doors. The shops then automatically tore off the notices and all opened for business. The cars passed by, and the shops immediately reopened. By 11:25 AM, everything had returned to normal, and the dispute was resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Representative Conference <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The First Special District Municipal Federation of Citizens convened a temporary representative conference of the district branches at 2:00 PM yesterday. Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Binghui, Tao Leqin, Wei Langxuan, and more than 50 others attended. Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, and Chen Binghui were the presidium, and Liang Gengshun was the recorder. After the ceremony, Chairman Hu Fengxiang reported the details of the strike and the persuasion to reopen. Then, the representative of the 25th District Branch reported, roughly stating: "When the Qi-Lu War was fought, the Engineering Bureau built walls to block the lanes on North Sichuan Road and compiled house numbers by the Engineering Bureau. In the 17th year of the Republic, the citizens automatically removed the house numbers, and the municipal government re-ordered new house numbers. After the Shanghai War, the shops and residents raised more than 900 yuan to help the Fifth District, Second Branch Police Station move to the nearby concession. This is also the intention of the merchants to ask the government to recover the road rights as soon as possible. In short, the merchants should pay the taxes of the municipal government, but because business is bleak, please ask the municipal government to postpone the collection temporarily. The director of the Fifth District, Second Branch Police Station illegally arrested people this time, and should be dismissed and investigated." Jin Jusheng also reported the details of the arrest, roughly stating: "At about 10:00 AM on the 18th of this month, we were summoned and detained. Our families sent food, but the director did not allow it. On the evening of the 19th, our families sent food again, and we were able to relieve our hunger. During that time, we could not drink water. At about 11:00 AM on the 20th, we regained our freedom. When we were in the police station, we asked (1) I am not a sub-landlord, why did you arrest me? (2) Arrests should have arrest warrants. (3) Why did you prohibit food from being brought in? The police station staff replied that if we were dissatisfied, we could tell our superiors." After discussion among the representatives, it was said that the municipal government already understands the facts of the case, and everything should be sought for the maintenance of the law, and the extraterritorial road construction should be recovered by the municipal government as soon as possible. It was also decided that the letter from the 25th District Branch requesting an investigation of the director of the Fifth District, Second Branch Police Station should be forwarded to the municipal government for review. The meeting was then adjourned. (Xin Xin News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Finance Bureau's Statement <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau stated regarding this matter: "The municipal government has long exercised police power in the extraterritorial road construction section of North Sichuan Road, and the public utilities such as water and electricity can also be supplied by the urban area. The citizens there should pay property taxes in accordance with the regulations and fulfill their obligations. Moreover, the costs of all public safety and public utilities of the municipal government are all borne by the citizens. The citizens there have not paid property taxes since today, and they have never paid them even before the war. That is to say, they have not fulfilled any obligations for all the municipal facilities they have enjoyed over the years. To put it bluntly, other citizens indirectly bear the burden for them. According to reason, how can it be said to be fair? There are indeed people there who understand the truth, and they also know that only having rights and not fulfilling obligations cannot last forever. As such, the bureau handles tax matters with impartiality. This time, the effective implementation of the collection of property taxes there is for the sake of equalizing the burden on citizens and indirectly protecting the interests of the majority of citizens, not just for increasing revenue. If they claim that business is bleak after the war and refuse to pay property taxes, then the municipal government's measures for tax exemption in the war zone have long been announced separately and are now a thing of the past. This reason is not valid. As for the claim that property taxes should only be collected after the extraterritorial road construction issue is resolved, it is even more unreasonable. Because in the extraterritorial road construction section of the city, if they have to pay special district property taxes due to the use of special district water and electricity, the city understands the difficulties of the people and will no longer collect taxes. Now that they have not paid special district property taxes, the city's implementation of the collection does not impose a double burden on the citizens there, and it does not violate the principles of taxation in any way. If they refuse to pay the city's property taxes on the grounds, it can be said that they have no responsibility to the local area, have not fulfilled the responsibilities of citizens at all, and are simply willing to have their obligations permanently borne by other citizens, and are willing to be the public enemy of all the citizens of the city. Once the municipal government submits this case to the municipal affairs meeting for discussion, the bureau will explain the truth according to reason, hoping that all sectors will understand the truth and correct it, so as not to have those who do not fulfill their obligations permanently share their burden."

<p>The Zhejiang-Eastern Highway Has Been Submerged. Zhenjiang-Yangzhou and Zhenjiang-Qingjiang Services Have All Been Suspended. Continuous Plum Rains Have Caused Flooding in Various Places. The Yangtze River Water Level in Hankou Has Exceeded 44 Feet, and the Situation Is Very Dangerous. At the Same Time, Several Places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Have Also Experienced Flooding, Disrupting Land and Water Transportation. Yesterday, the Reporter Made a Thorough Investigation of All Aspects. The Status of Inland Floods Is Recorded Separately Below:</p>
<h3 id="e113">Zhejiang East <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>In the upper reaches of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang, there have been non-stop rains in the past four days. Fuyang, Tonglu, Lanxi, and Jiande have all been affected by mountain torrents, and the water has flooded the land. The Zhejiang-Eastern Highway has been submerged, and cars cannot pass. Furthermore, small steamships in the upper reaches of the Qianjiang River have been severely impacted by the flood. With the navigation route no longer discernible, there is concern that they may sail into the foothills and cause accidents. Since the 19th, all ships have been suspended. The water and land transportation in eastern Zhejiang has been completely cut off, and the water-land combined transportation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou route has been interrupted. The goods loaded in Shanghai and bound for various places in eastern Zhejiang and the upper reaches of the Qianjiang River were suspended yesterday, and incoming goods were also blocked.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Zhenjiang and Yangzhou <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang-Yangzhou small steamers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Inland River Steamers Bureau in the port usually have a large business volume. According to Mr. Zhang Jianfei, the director of the bureau, the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou steamers have automatically suspended their services in the past three days because of heavy flooding, with the water level along the route being level with the banks. In Yangzhou, the inland river transportation has been completely suspended due to the sudden rise of the Huai River water level.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Zhenjiang and Qingjiang <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang-Qingjiang route is the longest, with the most stops along the way. Since the floods of two years ago, the route had been temporarily suspended due to the construction of dikes and embankments after the flood. Later, because the newly built dikes repeatedly collapsed, the route could only be operated in sections. It was not until February of this year that it was fully opened. However, not long after the operation, there has been heavy flooding again recently. It is feared that the movement of the ships will erode the newly built dikes, and if they collapse, a huge disaster will result from the backflow of floodwaters. Therefore, the Zhenjiang-Qingjiang steamers have been banned from operating again.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Changshu <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The competition between small steamers on the Changshu route has been fierce recently, with prices being reduced against each other. The price per passenger has fallen to as low as two dimes. Amid the price war, the small steamers are competing with each other, vying to be first. Unexpectedly, due to the continuous plum rains, the banks along the Changshu route have experienced a sharp rise in water levels. According to the crews of various small steamers, the highest water level along the route is only two feet from the bank. Farmers are already preventing small steamers from speeding. If the water level rises by more than a foot, the small steamers on that route will also be prohibited from operating.</p>

The Ministry of Railways Reprimands Car Service Employees for Inappropriate Conduct: The case of the annual salary increase requested by the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. After the railway bureau responded according to orders, the employees still believe that there is a need for consideration and are preparing for the second step. The unions of the two railways have specifically called a temporary meeting today, and the situation has become serious. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Instructions from the Ministry of Railways <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways instructed the administration of the two railway lines, stating: "In compliance with the order, the promotion and salary increase of the employees of each railway, although stipulated by the regulations of the ministry, must be at least one year from the date of the appointment or the last promotion, and must go through the performance appraisal procedures. Only those who are truly diligent, cautious, and competent, and have made meritorious achievements, can be promoted in accordance with the regulations. However, it has been found that the railway has not followed the regulations in previous years and has not conducted performance appraisals. All employees who have served for one year are given ordinary salary increases regardless of whether they are diligent in their work or whether their achievements are obvious, resulting in the same treatment for those with outstanding performance and those who are incompetent, increasing the desire to be fortunate and losing the purpose of reward, which is contrary to the original intention of the regulations and performance appraisal salary increases. Regarding the previous annual salary increase of the railway, the ministry has repeatedly stated the regulations and earnestly informed them last year. At a time when the country is facing a serious crisis and railway revenue is declining, the employees of the railway should strive to serve and perform their duties, but it has recently been found that the car service employees of the railway have taken the liberty of holding meetings and making requests regarding the salary increase for the 22nd year, and set a deadline for a response, which is very inappropriate and should be severely reprimanded to warn against this style of behavior. For all employees of the railway whose annual service period has expired this year, the bureau shall conduct a thorough and practical performance appraisal in accordance with the regulations and reward and punish them separately. The performance appraisal period is tentatively set for two times, at the end of June and the end of December of this year. Those who have reached one year or more from the date of appointment or the last promotion during the period from September 1 to the end of June will be appraised at the end of June. Those who have reached one year or more from the date of July 1 to the end of December will be appraised at the end of December and reported separately for review. As for the salary increase of workers, the railway is allowed to review and handle it appropriately and report it to the ministry for record. You are hereby ordered to comply."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Union Meeting <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The unions of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways decided to hold a temporary council meeting in Shanghai at 4 PM this afternoon to discuss salary increase requests from staff and other matters. Yesterday morning, telegrams were sent to various stations, including Zha Kou, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiashizhuang, and Qiaozhuang, stating: "All council members please note that the regular meeting has been changed to a council meeting and will be held at the association headquarters at 4 PM this Thursday, the 22nd. All council members are requested to attend on time to discuss important matters. Please do not be late. Sincerely, Railway Union Council, Ma Kou."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Staff Considerations <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The two-railway union received a telegram yesterday from Wuxi, stating: "To all colleagues in the train service of this line, and copied to all levels of Party branches, unions, sections, departments, factories, stations, and teams: Your telegram is acknowledged. The bureau's announced salary increase plan requires consideration. In addition to intensifying our work and continuing our efforts, we hope everyone will remain calm and await a resolution. Respectfully reported, Beijing-Shanghai Section Branch Office, Train Service Staff 22nd Year Annual Salary Increase Movement Delegation."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Joint Petition <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The council members of the two-railway union declared to the New Voice News reporter that the train service staff of the Beijing-Shanghai section, the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, and the Ningbo-Shaoxing section believe that the term "performance evaluation" in the railway bureau's response is too broad. The staff of the two railways have historically had no faults, and even if there were achievements, there are virtually none that can be considered special meritorious service. It is now decided to adopt the second step, namely, a joint petition to the Central People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Railways in Beijing by representatives from the three sections. However, the date of the petition will be determined by a staff meeting and will continue until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Dispute over Loading and Unloading at Mai Station <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau's Explanation</p>
<p>Petitions from Various Branches</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau Dispels Doubts</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ningbo Railway Administration abolished the Mai Gen Road Station Goods Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative and transferred the contract to Yang Hengzhen. The cooperative expressed its opposition. The Railway Bureau believes that it is handling the matter in accordance with the "Measures for Contracting the Loading and Unloading of Railway Goods" stipulated by the Ministry of Railways. However, the special Party branches and unions of the two railways believe that restoring the contracting system violates Party discipline. Each side holds its own view, and the dispute continues. A Central News Agency reporter heard from a person in charge of the Railway Bureau yesterday that the case involves ministerial regulations and Party principles, so the Ministry of Railways and the Central Party Headquarters have been asked to investigate thoroughly. Currently, Li Renzhu from the Workers' Section of the Central Party Headquarters and Guo Zhongxing from the Labor Section of the Ministry of Railways have been sent to Shanghai to jointly investigate and await a central resolution. The bureau does not intend to express any opinion at this time. As for the doubts from the outside world, the bureau has drafted a "Clarification of the Case" article, which will be published in the Two Railways Daily. The reporter then inquired about the history of the Mai Gen Road Station Goods Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative. It is said that the original files of the case were destroyed when the North Shanghai Station was bombed during the January 28th Incident, and there are few details to investigate. It was roughly proposed in the 17th year and implemented in the 18th year. At that time, the loading and unloading of goods at Mai Gen Road Station was handled by foreman Zhou Rongsheng. Due to accumulated malpractices and repeated complaints from merchants, it was impossible to rectify the situation. Therefore, the workers were allowed to organize a cooperative, and 30 articles of trial regulations were promulgated, with Shen Yuqing, Song Kaigui, Zheng Yongxing, Zhang Zichang, and others as leaders, originally to protect the interests of merchants, railways, and workers. The original text of the bureau's clarification is excerpted below:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Handling of This Case <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Process of Abolishing the Workers' Cooperative and Contracting to Yang Hengzhen for Loading and Unloading Goods at Mai Gen Road Station:</p>
<p>On May 7th, Yang Hengzhen formally requested to contract. On the 15th, Chen Chengshi reported on the investigation of Yang Hengzhen's situation, considering him suitable. On the 16th, Yang Hengzhen submitted his contracting opinions. On June 2nd, Yang Hengzhen submitted his application. On the 6th, Chen Chengshi telegraphed that he had made arrangements with the Workers' Section of the Central Party Headquarters and issued Yang Hengzhen a permit to contract. Separate letters were sent to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Security Department, notifying them of the reasons for abolishing the cooperative and ordering Yuan Boyang, Xie Wenlong, and Chen Chengshi to supervise the takeover. On the 7th, a notice was posted at the Mai Gen Road freight station stating that the loading and unloading of goods would be contracted to Yang Hengzhen starting from June 7th, notifying the cooperative of its abolition from June 7th, and sending a letter to the special Party branches of the two railways notifying them of the abolition process. On the 9th, it was reported to the Ministry of Railways for record (the minister and the responsible division chief had been informed verbally beforehand).</p>
<h3 id="e124">Explanation of the Contracting System <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Measures for Contracting the Loading and Unloading of Railway Goods were set by the Ministry of Railways as the fifth type of appendix to the "Detailed Rules for Responsible Transportation of Railway Freight Cars of the Republic of China," promulgated on November 5, 1932. Whether this is the contracting system, its interpretation... Although the sky has cleared...</p>
<h3 id="e125">The River Continues to Rise <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday it was 45 feet 1 inch!! People in Wuhan are extremely panicked.</p>
<p>We have just heard from a telegram from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau of the National Economic Committee's Engineering Office, saying that although the sky has cleared, the river continues to rise. At 9 a.m. on the 21st, the water level was 45 feet 1 inch. The water is only a foot or so away from the riverbank, and people are extremely panicked. The Engineering Office of the Association has now dispatched engineers Wu Shilin and Tang Shangsi to the Wuhan area to assist in flood prevention, and engineer Lu Chao has been sent to Beijing to attend the flood prevention meeting to discuss everything. As for the breach of the new dam at Jinkou in Wuchang, it is said that Jinshui is a confluence of many lakes and swamps. In recent years, the bottom of the lake has been gradually silted up. Local people have proposed to block the mouth and cultivate the land. Two years ago, they applied to the Relief Commission for Flood Victims for subsidies for wheat and built an earth dam at Jinkou. Last year, they had a bumper harvest. However, since the new dam was built on the old site of the river channel, it was not yet strong. Furthermore, it encountered continuous heavy rain and the river water rose sharply. The difference between the water level inside and outside was more than ten feet, and the pressure was too great, causing it to sink and breach.</p>
<p>rights are not within the jurisdiction of this bureau. However, the contracting system often allows contractors to enjoy excessive profits, while workers suffer excessive exploitation. Now, the Ministry has stipulated measures for contracting the loading and unloading of railway goods, which clearly define the rights and obligations of contractors and coolies (i.e., workers), and are subject to the strict command and supervision of the railway authorities, which is different from the contracting system. The most important point is that the contractor can only extract a maximum of 10% of the stipulated loading and unloading fee as his own remuneration and contracting expenses. Therefore, the contractor can never exploit the workers under the contracting system. For example, the current loading and unloading fee at Mai Gen Road Station is 20 cents per ton, the contractor can only get 2 cents, and the workers should get 18 cents, which the contractor cannot exploit.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Abolition of the Cooperative <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Mai Gen Road Station Goods Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative has been on trial for four years with poor results. Therefore, according to Article 26 of the trial regulations approved by the cooperative, "If the cooperative cannot comply with the regulations and violates the rules, this bureau may abolish the cooperative at any time and recruit other workers to load and unload," the cooperative was abolished.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Reasons for Recruiting Contractors <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>There are four ways to load and unload railway goods: (1) The railway recognizes the workers and they organize a cooperative to handle it themselves; (2) The railway hires workers itself to handle it; (3) The railway recruits contractors; (4) The consigning merchants handle it themselves. The first method is not very good in practice, and the fourth method is not very convenient for the railway and merchants. The Ministry of Railways has regulations for the second and third methods, of which the second method is the best, but it is not easy to implement. Since the Mai Gen Road cooperative urgently needs to be abolished, and hiring workers cannot be realized without considerable preparation, the third method is temporarily used, and Yang Hengze is entrusted to handle it, which is based on the "Measures for Contracting the Loading and Unloading of Railway Goods" of the Ministry of Railways. The loading and unloading of goods at Nanjing and Jiangbian stations is also handled by contractors.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Comparison of Two Benefits <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Although the cooperative stipulates that the benefits belong to all the workers and the expenses also belong to all the workers, the benefits (i.e., the loading and unloading fees) are fixed, but the expenses are not fixed. Therefore, if the leaders in charge of the cooperative have any encroachment, the workers not only do not know, but also have no power to interfere. The leader is the foreman, and people are exploited by him. If the cooperative is managed by the contractor, all expenses are borne by the contractor, and the workers have no responsibility, and the distribution of loading and unloading fees is fixed. For example, when the loading and unloading fee at Mai Gen Road Station was handled by the cooperative, it was stipulated to be 18 cents per ton, because the cooperative's expenses had to be deducted from these 18 cents, so the workers actually got less than 18 cents. When the contractor handles it, because it is stipulated to be 20 cents per ton, and the contractor is restricted to only taking 10%, all expenses have nothing to do with the workers, so the workers can get a net 18 cents, which is actually more beneficial than when the cooperative handled it. The loading and unloading is still done by the original cooperative workers, and the original loading and unloading fee of 18 cents per ton has to be removed expenses. Now it is possible to actually get 18 cents. Because the cooperative was run very badly in the past, merchants were almost extinct, income was reduced, and life was difficult. If the contractor runs well in the future, freight will increase, income will increase, and life can be more prosperous. Although the handover has not been completed, the workers are still ordered to work as usual. However, the loading and unloading fee from June 7th is temporarily issued directly by the station master according to the instructions of Li Renzhu, the worker section of the Central Party Headquarters who came to investigate this case. The cooperative leader did not allow the workers to accept it until June 20th, when Li Jun, together with Guo Zhongxing of the Ministry of Railways, supervised the Railway Bureau to issue it directly.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Workers Not Affected <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The contractor does not get a salary, but has to pay expenses. The Ministry of Railways' measures for contracting the loading and unloading of railway goods stipulate that the contractor can only extract a maximum of 10% of the loading and unloading fee, and also stipulate that they cannot demand anything else from the merchants besides the loading and unloading fee. Assuming that it is still extracted from the original 18 cents, then there is only 1 cent and 8 li, and the workers' income is only 16 cents and 2 li. Therefore, the Railway Bureau changed it to 20 cents per ton, so that it can extract 2 cents, which is enough for its expenses, and it does not need to demand extra from the merchants. The workers still get 18 cents, which is not less than when they were in the cooperative. Merchants may seem to be paying an extra 2 cents per ton for loading and unloading fees,</p>
<p>but other unrestricted abuses are eliminated, and they are not at a loss.</p>
<h3 id="e130">No Military Oppression <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>When the Railway Bureau ordered the cooperative to be abolished and ordered Yang Hengzhen to take over, it only sent Deputy Director Yuan Boyang of the General Affairs Department, Deputy Director Xie Wenlong of the Transportation Department, and Chen Chengshi, the chief of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Transportation Section, to supervise, fearing that there might be conflicts between the two sides. The resident railway police station was ordered to take precautions, and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Security Department were notified by the bureau in advance to send police teams to take precautions. They were not used to oppress the cooperative workers or protect Yang Hengzhen's takeover. Therefore, when the cooperative leader raised objections to the contracting system and refused to hand over, the bureau temporarily did not force Yang Hengzhen to take over.</p>
<h3 id="e131">One More Explanation <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the above items, there is one more thing that needs to be explained in the end, that is, the loading and unloading of railway goods involves the following aspects: (1) the railway's own business; (2) the business of the consigning merchants; (3) the livelihood of the workers; (4) the social economy. However, from the perspective of operating the railway, the relationship between the railway and the merchants is direct, the relationship with the workers is indirect, and the social relationship is the result of the previous relationships. Therefore, to solve this matter, we must first take into account the merchants and the railway, and also take into account the workers, and then the social economy is also included.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Branch Petition <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The loading and unloading branch of the Mai Gen Road Station, directly under the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ningbo Railway Union, sent representatives to Beijing to petition after the Two-Railway Administration abolished the cooperative. Yesterday, the loading and unloading branches of six stations, including Zhenjiang and Ningbo, came to Shanghai to jointly petition the special commissioners of the Central and Ministry of Railways, and prepared to distribute the loading and unloading fee income themselves. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Representatives from Various Stations Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Li Ganying, the representative of the loading and unloading branch of the Tenth Hai North Station directly under the Two-Railway Union, Zhong Ting, the representative of the loading and unloading branch of Suzhou Station, Li Wensheng, the representative of the loading and unloading branch of Zhenjiang Station, Zhuo Fangshu, the representative of the loading and unloading branch of Zhenjiang Jiangbian Station, Gu Simao, the representative of the loading and unloading branch of Cao'e Jiangbian Station, and Tao Fulin, the representative of the loading and unloading branch of Ningbo Station, arrived in Shanghai successively the night before. At 10 a.m. yesterday, they held a meeting at the Two-Railway Union and decided on the following: (1) jointly issue a declaration; (2) jointly petition the Two-Railway Union to fight to the end with all levels of Party branches; (3) send representatives to comfort the workers at Mai Station; (4) request the Two-Railway Union to send representatives to lead the petition; (5) petition the superior Party branches to uphold justice.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Representatives Jointly Petition <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The representatives of the loading and unloading branches of Zhenjiang and six other stations petitioned Li Renzhu, the special commissioner of the Central People's Movement Committee, and Guo Zhongxing, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, who came to Shanghai to investigate, at 3 p.m. yesterday. They were received at the Two-Railway Union and promised to report and handle the matter impartially. The original petition is recorded below: "Presenting a petition. We, the workers, have been terrified since hearing that the Railway Bureau used force to abolish the Mai Gen Road Station Loading and Unloading Cooperative and restore the contracting system. We have sent representatives to Shanghai to jointly discuss and assist the Mai Station. Now we hear that you have come to Shanghai to investigate and will have a fair resolution. However, in order to understand the truth of your resolution of the Mai case, we have sent representatives to respectfully listen to your instructions. We respectfully hope that you will accept our petition. Sincerely, the special commissioner of the Central Committee, Li, and the special commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, Guo."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Union Council Member Expresses <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>A council member of the Two-Railway Union declared to a reporter from New Voice that the loading and unloading fee at Mai Gen Road Station was originally collected from merchants by the cooperative and handed over to the Railway Bureau for safekeeping, and distributed every ten days, with the distribution dates being the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd of each month. Since the Railway Bureau used force to abolish the cooperative, since the 7th of this month, the Railway Bureau has refused to use the name of the cooperative to receive the loading and unloading fee, and the cooperative insists on using the name of the cooperative, so it has not been received so far. The cooperative will wait until the 23rd of this month. If the Railway Bureau still refuses to use the name of the cooperative to receive it, then it will decide to have the workers distribute the daily loading and unloading fee themselves and stop handing it over to the Railway Bureau for safekeeping.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Chen Gongbo Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Talking about the Two Principles of American Cotton Allocation</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. after taking the night train from Beijing the day before. He said that he came to attend the Fisheries Improvement Conference and had no other tasks. He will stay for a day or two and then return to Beijing. Regarding the distribution of American cotton and American wheat, this matter is entirely a technical issue of life and death. However, the principles of the Ministry of Industry are (1) not to make the price of foreign cotton lower than that of Chinese cotton; (2) for the distribution of Chinese cotton, American cotton must be used in factories at the same time. The method is still under study. As for the issue of revitalizing the rural economy, the Rural Economic Revitalization Committee meets every week to discuss it. The opinions of the Ministry of Industry have also been submitted to the Executive Yuan for adoption. Before a decision is made, it is inconvenient to publish it. As for the issue of factory inspection, it has already been handed over to the Labor Department for handling, and a method will be decided this month.</p>

<p>Detailed Method Plan Under Review</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau of this city previously intended to allocate a loan of 360,000 pounds from the Sino-British Geng Fund to improve shipping and build ships, and prepared a plan and submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. It is now learned that the bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday stating that the loan had been approved by the Sino-British Geng Fund Council, and that the detailed method plan was still under separate review. The original order is recorded below: "For the sake of knowing, the Board of Directors for Managing the Sino-British Geng Fund was approved to open a letter regarding the Central Political Conference's resolution that the Sino-British Geng Fund belonging to water conservancy projects, and that part of it should be used for the Huai River project.

On the 31st of last month, we received your ministry's first No. 1250 official letter stating that the China Merchants Bureau submitted to the ministry the budget for building ships, the estimated operating income and expenditure, the loan repayment schedule, and the draft loan agreement, and requested that the original documents be copied and forwarded for review, etc. With this approval, the 14th regular meeting of the Board of Directors on the 3rd of this month and the 16th meeting of the Board of Directors on the 5th of this month were submitted for discussion one after another, and the following resolutions were made: The resolution was passed, and the detailed methods and plans, the loan contract, etc., were submitted to the technical and financial committees for separate review, and Director Bu Long was additionally invited to participate in the discussion. A corresponding record has been sent, please investigate and instruct this knowledge, etc. Except for replying by letter, it is ordered to be known, this order."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Fisheries Improvement Association Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Minister Chen Gongbo Attended in Person</p>
<p>Fisheries Construction Fee Decided to Be Collected</p>
<p>Fisheries Federation Decided to Be Banned</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association held an emergency meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs International Trade Bureau to discuss a plan to improve fisheries. Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, came from Beijing to attend in person. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Attending Committee Members Those present yesterday included <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry and ex officio member, Zhou Jianying, Chief of Section of the Ministry of Industry, Dong Xiujia, Director of the Construction Department of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, Wang Wentai, representative of Zeng Yangfu, Chen Zhongsheng, Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration, Wu Huanru, representative of Wu Xingya, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, design committee members Xu Yifei and Lin Meiqing, elected committee members Wu Zhenqing, Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Lin Kanghou, and Dai Yongtang, and specialized committee member Hou Chaohai.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Chairman's Report The meeting was chaired by Chen Gongbo and recorded by Chen Qianfu. After the formalities, the chairman gave a report, saying <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>that since the establishment of the association, a fisheries construction fee of only 1% has been collected, and all previous ocean protection and other fees have been cancelled, which seems to have relieved the fishermen's suffering. In addition, the collected fees are still used for fisheries construction to protect the safety of offshore fisheries. A five-year fisheries plan has been formulated and will be implemented in stages. However, a few fishermen and merchants who do not understand the situation have telegraphed their opposition, which is a misunderstanding. In order to discuss a proper plan, a small group meeting will be organized to discuss the direction. Before the small group meeting is resolved, all the expenses of the association and the Fisheries Administration will be temporarily allocated by the Ministry of Industry to avoid disputes. He also hoped to discuss how to improve fisheries as much as possible, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Meeting Results The New News Agency reporter interviewed all parties yesterday and recorded the following <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>(1) Minister Chen advocated and passed the resolute collection of fisheries construction fees. (2) The five-year fisheries plan was confirmed and implemented in stages. (3) Before the construction fee is received, the expenses of the Fisheries Administration and the Fisheries Improvement Association, 2,000 yuan each per month, will be allocated by the Ministry of Industry for a period of three months. (4) The illegal collection of public river fees from fishermen and merchants by the fish industry guild was also discussed. It was generally agreed that the Ministry's collection of 1% of the construction fee has caused so much discussion, while the fish industry guild's unauthorized deduction of public river fees is considered the most serious oppression of merchants by middlemen. (5) Imported fresh and salted fish should be handled by another investigation small group meeting. (6) The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation is an illegal organization that has not been approved by the municipal Party department and the Social Affairs Bureau, and should be banned. (7) There are other small group meetings that specialize in dealing with the collection of construction fees.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Partial Modification of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Timetable <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>Since the Beijing-Shanghai Railway timetable was revised on the first of this month, it was felt that it was still not appropriate, so a partial modification will be made again from the 22nd of this month. (1) The 302nd, the domestic intermodal express train to the north, originally departed from the North Station at 1:00 a.m. every morning, but now it has been changed to depart at 9:50 p.m. every night, and it stops at Nanxiang, Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang, Zhenjiang, Longtan, and other stations to sell domestic intermodal tickets, and arrives in Nanjing at 6:10 a.m. the next morning.

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request for Explanation</p>
<h3 id="e145">Method for Re-electing Alternate Executive and Supervisory Committee Members <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received an instruction from the Municipal Executive Committee yesterday to forward the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of various doubts about the chamber of commerce election. The chamber of commerce believes that this interpretation has two points of divergence with the previous lottery re-election, so it has submitted another request for interpretation in order to comply with it. The Party department's instruction and the chamber of commerce's submission are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Party Department Instruction <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of informing, the Central People's Movement Committee's No. 3853 official letter stated: "The National Government's Judicial Yuan's Yuan character No. 913 official letter was approved, approving your association's official letters of February 25 this year (No. 3016) and April 15 (No. 3430) stating that the Executive Committee of Zhejiang Province and the Party Affairs Guidance Committee of Fujian Province requested an explanation of the doubts about the chamber of commerce election in two cases, please reply with a combined explanation, etc. This court has unified the interpretation of laws and regulations in its conference, (1) In the first re-election of the executive and supervisory committee members of the chamber of commerce, the executive committee members who were drawn out were re-elected as supervisory committee members, or the supervisory committee members who were drawn out were re-elected as executive committee members, cannot be called re-election. (2) The alternate executive and supervisory committee members of the chamber of commerce are re-elected according to the current law. Since there is no provision for re-electing half of the members, there is no need to re-elect the alternate executive and supervisory committee members during the first lottery re-election of the executive and supervisory committee members. A corresponding letter has been sent in reply to be forwarded separately to the Executive Committee of Zhejiang Province and the Guidance Committee of Fujian Province for information, etc. With this approval, a combined order is given to the association to inform and forward to the affiliated members, this order."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Chamber of Commerce Submission <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Submitting a petition, on the 20th of this month, we received the Fifth Two Two instruction from the government, stating that "the Central People's Movement Committee approved the Judicial Yuan's explanation of the Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee's explanation of the doubts about the Chamber of Commerce Law election in two cases, and the letter was forwarded for information, etc. In the second point of the Judicial Yuan's explanation, it is stated that 'the alternate executive and supervisory committee members of the chamber of commerce are re-elected according to the current law. Since there is no provision for re-electing half of the members, there is no need to re-elect the alternate executive and supervisory committee members during the first lottery re-election of the executive and supervisory committee members, etc.' When the association held the first lottery to re-elect half of the members in June last year, the government and the Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to the meeting to guide the election according to law. At that time, it was because Article 19 of the Chamber of Commerce Law did not specify that alternates were excluded from the re-election, so the alternate executive and supervisory committee members were also re-elected by lottery to re-elect half of the members. Now, according to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, those who were drawn out in the previous election and those who were elected as alternate executive and supervisory committee members as a result have changed their positions and relationships. How should we handle this in order to be appropriate? Should the alternate executive and supervisory committee members be re-elected every four years thereafter? We have prepared a document and submitted it to the government, requesting that it be instructed according to law for the sake of public convenience. Submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Taikoo Seamen's Strike Serious <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Public and Union Members Express Their Opinions</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Seamen's Branch was very angry about the tragedy of the Shanghai Taikoo Company expelling the middle cabin workers of the Changjiang route Wusong wheel. In order to make the company realize its mistake, it decided to provide strong support. Guangzhou dock workers automatically refused to load and unload passengers and goods from Taikoo's ships. Stores selling boat tickets refused to sell Taikoo passenger tickets. Customs brokers refused to load Taikoo's ships. The seamen of eight ships on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou route, including Foshan, Longshan, Taishan, Jinshan, and Jinhua, and the Nanhua route, including Xinjiang, Shandong, and Jinan, have all gone on strike in Guangzhou one after another. In order to prevent seamen from other ships from joining the strike, the Shanghai Taikoo Company is trying to avoid it. At the same time, in order to understand the truth, the Shanghai Company has sent a British staff member to Hong Kong to investigate and try to mediate. The opinions of the company and the union members are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e149">Company Statement <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The British-owned Taikoo Navigation Company, yesterday, issued a statement in English, of which the following is a translation: Taikoo Navigation Company has long had plans to improve Yangtze River ships for the convenience of travelers. However, these plans have not been realized because the stewards on the ships have refused to accept them. The system of hiring stewards existed from the very beginning of riverboat travel. At that time, it was considered to be of service and convenience to passengers. However, over the years, the number of stewards has gradually increased, and their power has grown. The stewards are hired by the ship's comprador without receiving a salary, instead relying on tips from passengers. This practice easily leads to trouble. In recent years, the company has received countless letters from passengers complaining about stewards extorting tips, especially from the poor, and even more so during the Sino-Japanese War last year. Because of their power, they can do whatever they want, even brutally extorting penniless refugees. The ship's comprador, despite his best efforts, cannot stop them. The company initially planned to reduce the number of stewards on board to make them easier to control. With fewer stewards serving more passengers, their income would still be substantial. Since passengers have no other recourse in the face of these unreasonable stewards, Taikoo has had to take matters into its own hands, ordering the comprador of the Wusong steamer to dismiss the worst offenders, as the stewards on that ship are particularly bad. Consider the following new system that Taikoo has implemented for the benefit of passengers: 1. Newly hired stewards will wear uniforms and be supervised by the chief steward. 2. A price list will be posted in a prominent place on the ship for passengers to consult, preventing stewards from extorting tips. 3. Passengers will receive free meals, preventing stewards from extorting meal fees. 4. Special inspectors will be assigned to the ship to monitor the stewards. All of Taikoo's ships will use this new system. Unfortunately, the stewards on the Wusong steamer opposed it, delaying its implementation. For the past five months, Taikoo has repeatedly discussed the matter with the old Wusong stewards without success. Although they had seen a peaceful resolution in Hankou, it was later ineffective. Now, there is a sudden and unexpected demand for mediation in Guangdong. This matter is only related to the Yangtze River incident and has nothing to do with Guangdong. To accommodate the stewards' demands, Taikoo had already understood the matter in Hankou. Merchants have suffered losses from boycotts in recent years. Taikoo has a long-standing relationship with Guangdong cargo owners and passengers and does not expect a rift over a small issue with the stewards. The stewards on other ocean-going ships are all able to perform their duties, so the company will not change the system. However, the number of stewards on the Yangtze River steamers is as high as one hundred and twenty per ship, so it is necessary to reduce them. Sailors, cooks, and stewards will not be reduced because they are all competent. The company is changing from a system of stewards without wages to a system with wages, and it will be able to select and employ competent stewards from among the existing stewards. The company will have to pay a large sum of money because most of the old stewards are not formally hired, so they have no need to remain. Taikoo is sacrificing and spending a lot of money only for the convenience of passengers. This matter is very important to the future of passengers and should not be swayed by rumors that could harm their interests.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Seamen's Reply <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seamen's Mid-Cabin Guild yesterday replied to the New Voice News reporter regarding Taikoo's statement, saying that the Taikoo Company's expulsion of all workers from the mid-cabin of the Wusong steamer has been ignored by the party and government organs in Shanghai and Hankou. Moreover, according to the mediation record of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, the request for the Taikoo Yangtze River line's workers to maintain the status quo has also been disregarded. Because the foreign company suppresses labor and despises government orders, the labor side was forced to submit the matter to the competent trade union, stating that the company's violent act was purely due to the comprador class's attempt to replace workers and collect huge deposits in order to achieve their desire to contract out labor and enrich themselves. Permission was granted to conduct serious negotiations in Guangdong to reinstate the workers on the ship. However, for more than two months, the request was refused, causing the workers to lose their jobs and wander about in misery, resulting in a strike. This is the history of the case. Now, we hear that the company is fabricating false statements in the hope of misleading the public. The main points are nothing more than the following: 1. The company claims that it ordered the comprador to dismiss bad elements among the workers on the Wusong steamer. However, our workers have no such problem. If there are any, there is no reason to dismiss the entire group. It is clearly a fabrication. 2. The company claims that the workers on the ship are detrimental to the passengers. However, our workers have no such problem. If there are any, it is due to the company and the comprador's bad system of hiring workers without paying salaries and demanding deposits. Now that the system remains unchanged, it is feared that each time new workers are hired, another deposit will be demanded. Their harassment of passengers will be even worse than that of our original workers. It is clear. 3. The company claims that the case occurred in Shanghai and has nothing to do with Guangdong. However, the nature of our seamen is mobile, and they can be dealt with anywhere. Moreover, the case was originally a conspiracy between the company and the comprador group to suppress and replace workers on various liners. Similar incidents have occurred on the Nanhua Line's Suiyang steamer, which is the beginning of the problem. Furthermore, the company and compradors in Shanghai rely on the dock's status as a concession for protection. Negotiations in Guangdong would avoid obstruction. Based on the nature of the situation, it is appropriate to handle the case in Guangdong after it originated in Shanghai. Who can say it is not appropriate? In summary, the company's purpose is only to exploit the workers' hard-earned money and fill its capital for economic aggression in the shipping industry. As for its false accusations of the above three matters and other arguments detrimental to our workers, they are all lies. We fear that the outside world does not understand the truth, so we are making this statement. We hope that all circles will uphold justice and help the workers so that the dispute can be resolved and the unrest can be calmed as soon as possible. We would be grateful.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a telegram from the Guangzhou Seamen's Union requesting a halt to the loading of Guangdong goods to avoid losses. The Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded the telegram to various industries and replied, saying: Guangzhou Seamen's Union, your telegram is noted. It has been forwarded to various industries. However, the situation should not be expanded. We still hope that you will value commercial transport and resolve the matter peacefully as soon as possible. Please also persuade the associations in Xiamen and Shantou. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Ma</p>

<h3 id="e153">Record of the British University Dinner Party <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Lecture by Aviator Herts</p>
<p>The British University Dinner Party of this city was held at the Hua Mao Hotel the day before yesterday. Many British students and British people attended, and the famous British aviator Sir Herts was invited as a guest of honor. Mr. Herts used to hold the highest aviation position in the British government. He arrived in China six weeks ago to inspect the aviation situation in China. According to his speech, China has great potential for development in both civil and military aviation, but it should be noted that civil aviation cannot replace roads and railways. The three must complement each other and progress together to facilitate transportation in various places. Regarding military aviation, a complete national defense plan should be in place before purchasing aircraft, otherwise, a large amount of money will be wasted and an effective air force will not be formed. In terms of civil aviation, based on the experience gained in the United Kingdom in the past ten years, passenger flights and mail flights should be operated separately. Postal services value speed. Even if an aircraft accident or mid-way landing may result in the loss of mail, it must not be delayed. Passenger flights, on the other hand, should prioritize safety. Passengers' itineraries may be slightly delayed, but they must not be put at risk of an accident. Therefore, the speed of mail planes should be more than 200 miles per hour, and the speed of passenger planes should not exceed 140 miles to 150 miles per hour. In the military field, the air force is undoubtedly the best national defense weapon for China, but the Chinese people and the government must not waste money by indiscriminately purchasing military aircraft. The government must first conduct in-depth research and formulate a comprehensive plan on the meaning and necessity of the air force before purchasing aircraft. Without a corresponding plan and a detailed sky defense plan, indiscriminate purchase of aircraft would only waste money. Therefore, the Chinese people are advised to keep in mind that the best policy for civil and military aviation is not to purchase hastily but to first conduct detailed research and formulate the best plan. If there is a good plan first, China can avoid wasting money and easily achieve the needs of military air defense and the development of civil aviation.</p>
<h3 id="e154">After the Philippine Study Mission Returns to the Philippines <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Continued News on Developing Sino-Philippine Trade</p>
<p>The Philippine commercial study mission came to China a few days ago to investigate the industrial situation. Our officials and businessmen took this opportunity to give them a warm welcome to enhance Sino-Philippine relations and seek to develop exports to the Philippines. It is reported that after the mission returned to the Philippines, it immediately began to compile a report and opinion to be submitted to the Philippine Congress for adoption and implementation. In the future, there is hope for progress in Sino-Philippine trade. According to a report from the Guowen News Agency yesterday, after the mission returned to the Philippines, there was no news and no work was in progress. After this news was published, various commercial firms in this city related to trade with the Philippines did not think so. According to the Zhongxing Bank on Sichuan Road, our welcome to the study mission's visit to China was to fulfill our duty as the host. The mission is a study group, and its findings must be submitted to the Congress for adoption and cannot be implemented by the mission itself. The Philippine Congress is currently busy with the issue of independence, and even if the matter is brought up for discussion, it may still have to wait for some time. It is inappropriate to criticize without investigating the facts. It will not only not help but will also hurt Sino-Philippine relations. There are more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, occupying a superior position in the business community. In the future, there is hope for an increase in the export of Chinese goods to the Philippines. Chinese merchants should strive for development and not be discouraged by inaccurate news. As for the statement that the tea and egg samples were taken away by the mission as gifts, it is even more of a lack of great-power magnanimity.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association yesterday received notifications from various donation collection points, which are recorded separately below.

<h3 id="e157">Yesterday We Heard Objections to the Sale of the Xianmian Temple <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Zhabei District Farmers' Association announced its opposition to the sale of the Xianmian Temple by Shanghai Middle School, it has attracted much attention from the community. Farmers from all over the country have responded. According to Mr. Qi Boju, secretary of the Zhabei District Farmers' Association, the Xianmian Temple is a monument to the agricultural sage Huang Daopo and is undoubtedly a local public property. Even Mr. Zheng Xigu, the principal of Shanghai Middle School, admitted this in his published speech. It is a pity that Mr. Zheng is too enthusiastic and truly sacrifices himself for education, resolutely disregarding everything and wanting to sell the Xianmian Temple to obtain a good price and complete the new school plan. This kind of illegal action will not be tolerated by public opinion. However, considering Mr. Zheng's position, it is still excusable. However, the speech of Mr. Zhang Yi, the director of the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Hall, is very strange. The gains and losses and sale of local public property in Shanghai City are of no concern to the County Farmers' Education Hall. However, Mr. Zhang Yi, as the director of the Farmers' Education Hall, should respect the agricultural sages, awaken the farmers to look back and think about the future, and know what to improve. He said that the Xianmian Temple may as well be sold. May I ask what is the reason? Every country has religious holy places and shrines to sages, but they are all located in large cities, with a large population in prosperous areas, making it easier to visit. Moreover, historical sites with commemorative significance lose their effect if they are moved. Therefore, churches are all over the world, but we have never heard of the destruction of the Roman holy sites. Confucius temples are all over China, but we have never heard of the neglect of Qufu in Lu County. Now, Mr. Zhang, as the director of farmers' education, actually said that the Xianmian Temple may as well be sold and moved to the countryside, which is very puzzling. In short, our association and the city's farmers will definitely resist the sale of local public property and the destruction of the shrine to the sages.</p>

The family of the deceased claimed that the policeman should not have shot him immediately and demanded an explanation. The chief of the police station, Liu Yunfang, detained the policeman Wu and sent him to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the local court. The prosecutor investigated and considered it negligent homicide, and filed a public prosecution. The presiding judge of the criminal court interrogated him the day before yesterday.

<p>Huang Zhou, an old woman from Nanjing, gave birth to a boy 30 years ago when she was a vegetable seller in the Great Horse Road Small Vegetable Market. The deceased wealthy household Xi Heming sent his cook Li Ruilin to take the boy back to raise him. He then falsely claimed that the boy was the son of his concubine, and named him Longsheng. Now, Longsheng is married and has children. However, Huang Zhou has suffered many misfortunes in recent years. After her husband died, her two remaining sons died one after another. She and Mai Gu lived a hard life. Last year, she found out the whereabouts of her youngest son and demanded support. Because Longsheng denied that she was his biological mother, she filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court. As a result, Longsheng provided funds for a settlement. This spring, she hired lawyers Zhang Shewo and Gu Ao to sue the First Special District Local Court, requesting confirmation that Longsheng was her biological son. After the initial trial, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. However, it is feared that it is not easy to make Longsheng, who is rich and wealthy, serve a poor old woman as his mother. Therefore, Longsheng was not satisfied with the judgment and hired lawyers Zhang Rongxi and others to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, attacking the impropriety of the original judgment and demanding a reversal. Yesterday afternoon, the Civil Court President Li Dong and two judges, Ye and Ni, held a court hearing. The appellant Huang Zhou could not attend due to illness. Judge Li first asked Xi Longsheng if he was willing to reconcile. Xi resolutely refused. Then, Xi's lawyer stated the grounds for the appeal, which can be divided into four points: 1. The date of birth of Xi Longsheng provided by Huang Zhou in the initial trial does not match the date of birth written on Xi's wedding invitation. 2. The testimony of the witness Li Ruilin cited by the old woman has many weaknesses and is not necessary to adopt. Moreover, it is contradictory, which shows that he does not have a deep understanding of the case. The old woman should be ordered to cite another witness. 3. The statement was signed by Huang Zhou herself. This kind of evidence is very powerful. Unexpectedly, the original trial judge looked at the article from the opposite side, thinking that the establishment of this document further proves that Xi Longsheng is the old woman's biological son. The role of this document is to be a contract to sever the relationship between mother and son. According to the civil law, this contract that violates good morals should be declared invalid. Therefore, the original trial's view is very wrong. If everything is viewed from the opposite side, it is even more difficult to get the truth. 4. Huang Zhou's request is to order Xi Longsheng to return to his clan. However, Xi Longsheng is still being adopted and cannot legally restore the relationship of a biological son. Even if the judgment is in favor of the plaintiff, the plaintiff may not be able to obtain legal benefits. Therefore, this type of case cannot be filed. The original trial should have rejected it, but it was the opposite. Therefore, we request that if your court believes that the lawsuit is illegal, it should be rejected. If you want to proceed with the trial, Huang Zhou must be ordered to cite other evidence and conduct a rigorous investigation before making an appropriate judgment to show fairness. Because the court initially solicited reconciliation opinions, the lawyer for the appellant Zhang Shewo immediately stood up and stated that our client is very willing to settle the matter. If there is a way to reconcile, we can discuss it. Judge Li immediately ordered both parties to go outside and try to reconcile and wait for a summons on a fixed date.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Defecating on Wasteland Leads to Accidentally Triggering a Bomb <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Li Bingsheng's Right Hand Blown Off, Severe Injuries to Waist and Shoulder, Still Four Bombs to be Detonated by the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>| Bombs Wrapped in Russian Newspapers |</p>
<p>Li Bingsheng, a native of Hubei, is 41 years old and lives in the Hongxing Tea Garden on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. He is a carpenter and used to work in Hankou. He fled to Shanghai three years ago during a flood. At 8:50 AM yesterday, Li suddenly felt the urge to defecate. Because there was no chamber pot in his residence, he went to the wasteland in front of the Red Swastika Society clinic at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Baochang Road. Li saw five paper packages wrapped in foreign newspapers lying on the grass. Out of curiosity, he touched them with his foot. With a loud bang, the touched paper package suddenly exploded, shaking the surrounding area. At the same time, Li's right hand was blown off, and his waist and shoulders were injured by iron fragments. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious. After being discovered by residents around, they rushed to report to the 5th District Police Station. The District Chief dispatched patrolmen to the scene to investigate. First, the injured person was sent to the Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road for treatment by ambulance. After examination by the hospital's doctor, his right hand had been amputated. If there are no other changes, there should be no major problems. There were still four unexploded paper packages. District Chief Jin specially dispatched District Member Xia Xuanyu to the scene to investigate. It was found that the paper outside was Russian newspapers. After opening them, there were four circular bombs inside without mechanisms or fuses, so they could not be moved. District Member Xia reported the facts to District Chief Jin, who led District Member Xia and others back to the scene at 3:30 PM to inspect again. He poured kerosene on the bombs and used straw as a fuse to ignite and destroy them. When the four bombs exploded, the sound shook the sky, shooting up to a height of more than 20 feet. If the explosion of the bomb Li touched had triggered the other four bombs, the tragedy would have been unimaginable.</p>

<p>Detective Team Extracts Chen Baosheng's Statement</p>
<p>In the tragic case of the New Renhe steamboat murdering five peddlers, Ma Koubao, Wu Datong, Mei Laoer, Wei Jinfu, and Shen Xinliang, in addition to the steamboat owner Sun Xingsheng and others who have been arrested and brought to justice, the assistant comprador Chen Baosheng was also arrested by the detective team. After being detained, Chen's relatives requested permission for his release on bail because Ding was seriously ill. The Shanghai Local Court sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send Chen Baosheng for interrogation. The detective team prepared a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for release the day before yesterday. Director Wen issued it to the Third Section for interrogation, which was then issued to the interrogation unit director Lin Zhaofen by Section Chief Pan Geya.</p>

<p>At that time, Chen Baosheng confessed that on April 12 of this year, our steamboat set sail from Haimen to Shanghai. When passing the Xinjiang River, not far from Haimen, the crew on the steamboat detained Ma Koubao, Wu Datong, Mei Laoer, Wei Jinfu, and Shen Xinliang. At that time, I was sleeping soundly on the boat, so I did not know the details. However, I later heard that after Ma Koubao and others were detained by the crew on the boat, they were first punched and kicked, and then reported to the shipowner Sun Xingsheng. At that time, Wang Guanxian, the associate manager of our company, was also on the ship. Wang convened Sun Xingsheng and other senior</p>

<p>and sent people to hang Ma Koubao and others on the roof of the ship, and beat them again before putting Ma and others down, and closing them into the cabin. Then Wang Guanxian came up with the idea to have people put Ma and others into burlap sacks, and tied a huge stone to each person. When the steamboat arrived near Santaijia, they were thrown into the river together to destroy the evidence. Later, Wang Guanxian saw that Ma and others had been thrown into the river and would never return. Fearing that the matter would be leaked and discovered, he released a very long whistle (a signal on the ship) to summon all the crew on the ship,</p>

<p>The agreement stated that we would share the blessings and share the difficulties. Afterwards, Wang showed me the secret agreement and ordered me to sign and stamp it. I thought this matter was very important, so I refused. Unexpectedly, Wang suddenly threatened me loudly, saying that if I refused to sign the agreement, they would use</p>
<p>the method of dealing with Ma and others on you, etc. I had no choice but to be forced to sign my name on the agreement. Later, when the steamboat arrived in Shanghai, I left the steamboat and fled to another place. Until about 7:00 PM on the 17th of this month, I was arrested by the detective team in the home of my relative Teng Maobin in Huaxingli, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, while visiting my sick wife. When questioning Teng Maobin and others, because they were only relatives of Chen and had nothing to do with the case, the confession of this case was ordered to be temporarily retained. A copy of the confession will be submitted to Section Chief Pan for review tomorrow morning, and then submitted to Director Wen for review, and will be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for handling tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. According to the case of the New Renhe Steamboat tragedy,</p>
<h3 id="e167">Supporters' Association Letter <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Briefly stated, regarding the case of the Xin Renhe ship plotting to kill the small vendors Ma Koubao and four others, on the twelfth of this month, a floating corpse was suddenly discovered in Gulongdun, the fifth district of Baoshan County. The hands and feet were bound backwards, the head was wrapped in a burlap sack, and a rock weighing thirty to forty pounds was tied to the back. Local citizens reported this to the township office, which in turn requested the county government to send personnel for examination and to post a public notice for claiming the body. This matter came to the attention of Yu Jingzi, a standing committee member of the supporters' association for the case. He then summoned the relatives of the deceased for a thorough investigation. It was undoubtedly confirmed to be Wei Jincheng, the victimized small vendor. Consequently, on the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth days, he led all the relatives of the deceased to claim the body. After approval from the trial officer of the county, it was decided to open the coffin for identification at eight o'clock yesterday morning. Yu Jingyu and others, along with the relatives of the deceased, arrived at six-thirty yesterday morning. At nine-ten, Mr. He, the county trial officer, along with the clerk, Chief Huang of the police, and the examiner Tao, arrived at the scene and summoned local laborers to break ground. This attracted nearly a thousand men, women, old and young, who came to watch. Six or seven news reporters from various Shanghai news agencies also came specifically to take photographs. At exactly ten o'clock, the coffin had been taken out. Examiner Tao directed the earthworkers to</p>
<h3 id="e168">Remove the Corpse <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>A square stone was placed next to the corpse, tied with ropes in a cross shape. The body was dressed in a white twill short shirt, a twill cotton-padded jacket, a plain-colored twill cotton vest, flower-threaded woolen trousers, plain-colored twill willow-patterned lined trousers, plain-colored thread socks, plain-colored cloth shoes, and a plain-colored waistband. The relatives of the deceased stepped forward for examination and immediately collapsed to the ground, crying out "Little Fatty" (Wei Jincheng's nickname) uncontrollably. The trial officer, clerk, news reporters, and representatives of the supporters' association all stood on nearby grave mounds to observe. The corpse was naked (the clothes were removed during the initial examination), with its head facing east and feet facing west. The entire body was purple-black, and the hands and feet were bent backwards. Despite being turned over twice, the body remained in a crawling position, covered in bruises and scars from wire ropes, all clearly visible. The news reporters immediately competed to take photographs. Now, the corpse report is recorded as follows: The deceased was found to be four feet two inches tall, with a burlap sack covering the head, bearing the words "Great New Company" [大新公司]. The hair was sparse and slightly bald, and the head was round and square. The clothes mentioned above had already been removed. The hands were bound backwards with burlap ropes and wire, and the feet were also tightly bound with burlap ropes and wire, with a rock weighing thirty to forty pounds attached. On the right arm was a vaguely discernible tattoo of a flower character. On the left arm were tattoos of "Never part, hearts united, forever enlightened, righteous heart" and the English letters "Nmse", surrounded by plum blossoms. The entire body was covered in bruises. From the appearance, it was evident that he had been beaten before being bound and thrown into the sea to drown. At this point, the authorities summoned Mrs. Ma Chen, Mrs. Mei You, Mrs. Wei Zhu, Mrs. Zhan Ma, Mrs. Sun Zhou, and Xia Xiaosanzi, Wei Jincheng's second landlord, etc., to the side of the vehicle for questioning, asking whether the corpse was one of the victims. Except for Mrs. Sun Zhou, who replied that she did not recognize him, all others replied that it was Wei Jincheng. The official asked if they were willing to claim the body. They replied that they were willing. The official said that if they wanted to claim the body, they should first sign a pledge. They replied that they could. Therefore, they produced a pre-printed claim form and had the five families put their fingerprints on it. Then, they ordered the relatives of the deceased to prepare a coffin themselves and take the body back for burial. The representatives suggested that the county government send someone to guard the area and that the burlap sack, stones, wire ropes, and clothes should first be handed over to the relatives of the deceased to be submitted to the court for verification.</p>
<p>The 126,000 Yuan Robbery Case</p>
<p>Another 30,000+ Yuan of Stolen Goods Recovered</p>
<p>Two More Suspects Arrested in Jiaxing &amp; Confessions Obtained; Detectives Recovered More Loot in Pudong</p>
<p>On the dawn of the 16th of this month, the robbery of 126,000 yuan occurred on Yong'an Street, Xin Kai He, French Concession. The circumstances of the incident and the successive arrests of the robbers Wang Maonv, Huang Bosheng, and female accomplices Wang Amao and Zhang Yushi, etc., by the concession police authorities, resulted in the recovery of over 7,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars. They were sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. The suspects confessed to having accomplices named Li Arong, Zhang Weicai, Ashi, Abao, Aqing, and Da Luosong, etc. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the two suspects, Li Arong and Zhang Weicai, fled to Jiaxing on the 17th of this month. They purchased clothing materials at the Lao Jiafu Silk Shop and bought leather shoes and suitcases at the Samsung Shoe Store. Their actions were lavish, spending money like water, and their demeanor was panicked, raising suspicion. They were discovered by Li Zhankui, a member of the local defense corps, who, together with police officers from the Third Police Station of the Guanyinge Public Security Bureau, followed them to Room 34 of the Dadong Hotel. They arrested the robbers Li Arong (35 years old) and Zhang Weicai (36 years old, from Ningbo), and found luggage, clothing, and 865 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars. They were taken to the bureau for investigation and then detained. A telegram was sent to the French Concession police station, and the head of the police sent personnel to escort the two suspects and the stolen goods on the night express train, arriving in Shanghai at 11 PM last night. They were taken to the Songshan Road police station (where they were interrogated thoroughly that night). Zhang confessed that many accomplices were still at large and that a large amount of banknotes and silver dollars were hidden at No. 54, Lane 121, Chuanjiang Road, Pudong. After obtaining this confession, the French police immediately ordered Inspector Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Zhang Ziying, Deputy Detective Zhou Yaoting, etc., to cooperate with the detective team leader Chen Guangyan and detective Li Xiaobao, etc., dispatched by Captain Lu. They escorted the two suspects across the river to Pudong, and together with Section Chief Zhang Mingqin of the Third District, who dispatched officers Zhang Deshan, etc., they rushed to No. 54, Lane 121, Chuanjiang Road at noon. They found two suitcases. The detectives examined them on the spot and found five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes and silver dollars from various banks, including the Bank of China, Central South Bank, and Central Bank, neatly bundled, totaling 38,200 yuan. It was reported that there were no men in the house, only a loyal woman. She claimed that she had only stored the two suitcases at the time and did not know what was inside. The officers then took the recovered stolen goods to Captain Lu to file a report. After the report, Inspector Jin took them back for interrogation at around 1 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e169">A Three-Sail Fishing Boat Lost at Sea <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Boat Owner and Crew Drowned, Five Deaths Total; Only Two Survivors Rescued</p>
<p>丨Two People Drifted in the Ocean for Eleven Hours丨</p>
<p>At 7 PM on the 19th of this month, a three-sail fishing boat capsized in the rough seas off Da Xie Mountain, resulting in the drowning deaths of five people, including the boat owner and crew members. Only two people were rescued. The boat itself has also drifted away and its whereabouts are unknown. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e170">Fishing in the Ocean <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Daishan Island, which belongs to Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, is a small island in the Zhoushan archipelago off the coast of the province. It has a population of over ten thousand households, most of whom make a living by fishing. Therefore, they are generally strong and resilient, and unafraid of wind and waves in the ocean. Zhu Linshe, who lives in a high-lying area of the island, is 35 years old. He owns a three-sail fishing boat and works year-round catching fish, regardless of the cold or heat. In addition to serving as the captain of the boat himself, he also employs six crew members: Pan Aheng (37 years old), Zhu Atang (22 years old), Tong Chunjin (45 years old), Jiang Yifang (37 years old), Aying (24 years old), and Yao Lin (17 years old). The boat can carry up to 30,000 catties of fish. Their fishing method involves using over a hundred large nets, each about four zhang long, connected to each other and cast into the sea, stretching for about three li. Each time they catch fish, they get more than ten thousand fish at most and only dozens at least. The catch varies depending on the season. The fish are mainly sold in Zhapu, Dinghai, and Gaoding, and sometimes resold to Shanghai fishing boats for sale in Shanghai. However, the boat itself has never been to Shanghai. The crew's wages on the boat are very low. In addition to daily meals provided by the boat owner, each person receives a daily wage of about six or seven dimes.</p>
<h3 id="e171">A Huge Wave Capsizes the Boat <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>On the twelfth of this month, the boat set sail from Dinghai to fish along the coast. On the nineteenth of this month, at noon, they arrived at the waters off Da Xie Mountain to catch hairtail. That evening, during high tide, they anchored near the foot of the mountain. At that time, the wind and waves were strong, but Zhu and the other six people, accustomed to this kind of life, did not find it unusual. After dinner, around seven o'clock, it was already dark, and the evening wind became stronger, so the waves became more rapid, suddenly rising to about two or three zhang. The turbulent waves came rolling in incessantly, and the fate of the boat came to an end. At that time, a huge wave came rushing in, and the boat was immediately overturned. Two people were trapped in the cabin and died because they could not climb out. The remaining five people reacted quickly, each grabbing a piece of the cabin plank and letting the water carry them away. Due to the rising tide, they gradually floated closer to the coast. Late that night, they saw a ship passing by about a hundred zhang away. The five people shouted for help, but the ship did not hear them. At three o'clock in the morning, the tide turned, and the five people were carried out again by the tide. Three of them drifted away first and drowned at sea. The remaining two people, Pan Aheng and Zhu Atang, still held tightly to the planks and were able to survive. Until six o'clock in the morning, they floated near Da Xie Mountain and were close to the New Yangtze pilot boat, where they were rescued. These two people had drifted in the ocean for eleven hours and managed to survive, which was very dangerous.</p>

<p>The ship rescued Pan and Zhu, changed them into dry clothes, and gave them warm medicine to eat to ward off the cold. The two people stayed on the ship for a day and night. Yesterday morning, the ship returned to Shanghai and sent the two people to the Customs Harbor Affairs Office, which in turn sent them to the Water Police Station. After the police station learned the details of the disaster, they ordered them to be sent back to their hometown in Ningbo by the Ningbo Fellow Association. According to the two men, the disaster they encountered was unexpected. The loss of the boat alone amounts to thousands of dollars. There were also thousands of hairtail caught on board, which have all scattered. The five crew members who died have not yet been notified to their families, which is even more tragic. Now, the two of us are eager to return home and hope that the police station will send us back to our hometown as soon as possible so that we can inform the families. The two men spoke in a dialect similar to Ningbo and seemed sincere.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Overseas Chinese Merchants in Japan Involved in Lawsuit for Selling Gold Bars <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>One Side Demands Travel Expenses Along the Way; The Other Seeks to Recover Embezzled Funds</p>
<p>丨丨 Arguments Concluded; Awaiting Judgment 丨丨</p>
<p>Lin Yimei, Wang Bingchu, Hua Wuchuan, Wang Xingqing, Xu Jibiao, Li Maozhang, and others, overseas Chinese merchants in Japan, recently had a dispute over the selling price of gold bars that they transported from Japan to Shanghai. Each side refused to yield, so they sued each other in the First Special District Local Court. Each side presented their own arguments. According to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs Lin Yimei and his wife, Lin Shen, they operated a business in Yokohama, Japan. Before returning to China in March of this year, they were entrusted by the defendants Wang Bingchu and four others to carry 141 taels and 3 qian of gold bars to Shanghai for sale, with a limited price of 83 yuan per tael. All expenses along the way were to be borne by the entrusters. At that time, Wang Bingchu was detained by the Japanese police for illegally exporting gold bars, while the others, including Hua Wuchuan, had already returned to China. When the Lins arrived in Shanghai, the others were already waiting in Shanghai. Lin sold the gold bars to the Hongtai Money Exchange on Outer Hongqiao for 100 yuan per tael. Lin believed that the expenses along the way amounted to 17 yuan per tael and should be deducted from the price. Therefore, when he handed over the money to the others, he gave them 11,727 yuan and 9 jiao. The remaining 2,402 yuan and 1 jiao was used to offset the expenses he had advanced. However, Lin claimed that the total expenses along the way amounted to 4,039 yuan. After deducting the offset amount, there was still 1,636 yuan and 9 jiao that needed to be reimbursed. He asked the others to make up the difference, but the others not only refused but also claimed that the actual selling price at the time was 107.5 yuan per tael. They gathered a group of people and went to Lin's house to demand the return of the embezzled funds. After a conflict with Lin, the others reported the matter to the Hongkou police station at midnight on the 20th of last month. The head of the police sent Detective Sun Aizhong to investigate. Lin was not at home, so they arrested Lin's wife. However, after finding no evidence, they released her. Lin claimed that the defendants should not have made false accusations and assaulted his wife. They had committed crimes under Articles 180, 363, and 293 of the criminal law. In addition to requesting punishment, he also demanded compensation for his wife's medical expenses of 30 yuan. After Wang Bingchu and Liu Wuchuan were accused, they also filed a counterclaim against the Lins, claiming that Lin had committed several crimes and describing the circumstances of the gold bars being defrauded. The business locations of Wang Bingchu and others were all in Tokyo, while Lin's business location in Yokohama was hundreds of miles away. Since the Sino-Japanese conflict had worsened, Wang and others felt endangered in the enemy country, so they closed their businesses and used their cash to purchase over 140 taels of gold bars. They entrusted Liu Wuchuan to take care of them, hoping to smuggle them back to China. Lin Yimei learned of this. At that time, the Japanese government strictly prohibited the export of gold, so Lin willingly flattered foreigners and harmed his compatriots by secretly reporting to the Japanese police. Wang Bingchu was immediately summoned by the Japanese police for investigation. Lin then rushed to Liu Wuchuan's shop, informed him that Wang had been arrested, and took the opportunity to threaten him, saying that the police station would soon send people to search the shop. If the hidden gold bars were found by the police, they would be subject to severe penalties and confiscation. Liu and the other four people, unaware of Lin's trickery, were grateful to him and entrusted all their gold bars to Lin for temporary safekeeping, intending to retrieve them from Lin before their departure to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Lin immediately took his wife and left Japan for Shanghai. As soon as he arrived, he sold the gold bars for 107 yuan per tael. When Liu Wuchuan and others tracked him down, the goods had already been sold. Liu and others immediately notified Wang Bingchu to rush to Shanghai and negotiated with Lin. Lin realized that it would be difficult to swallow everything, so he returned over 11,700 yuan of the gold price. According to Liu and others' calculations, there was still a shortage of over 3,380 yuan. Chen Jingui, a friend of Lin, came forward to mediate and agreed that Lin would pay another 1,000 yuan to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, Lin initially agreed but then went back on his word and refused to pay this 1,000 yuan, preferring to hire a lawyer and litigate the matter. As for the various allegations made by Lin, Wang Bingchu and others also refuted them one by one, stating that they were originally in business for profit and would not limit themselves to selling at 83 yuan. Their statements were obviously false. Even if it were true that they had entrusted him to carry the gold bars, how could the expenses for carrying a mere hundred taels of gold bars amount to as much as 4,039 yuan? Who would believe that? Fortunately, gold bars are still expensive now. If it were in the past when gold was cheap, the total price would probably not be enough to cover the travel expenses, which shows their psychology. As for Lin selling the gold bars for 107 yuan, this can be verified by the market price on that day. Therefore, they especially request that he be punished for fraud, embezzlement, and other crimes, and that he be ordered to repay the remaining 4,039 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Su Xiefen of the First Special District Local Court opened a hearing and summoned both sides for questioning. After the lawyers Gu Hanli, representing Lin Yimei, and Tang Huaiqun, representing Wang Bingchu, concluded their arguments, the judge announced that a date would be set for judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Revival of Sanlintang Watermelons <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Agricultural Education Center Guiding Improved Planting Methods</p>
<p>The melon crops of Sanlintang, Pudong, have always been renowned, especially watermelons. In recent years, farmers have been careless about selecting seeds, sowing, transplanting, and pressing vines. As a result, the yield has decreased, and the farmers do not blame themselves for their poor methods, but simply complain about their bad luck. Furthermore, due to the high transportation costs, the extortion of hooligans, and the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants, they have found it unprofitable. Therefore, they have switched to planting other crops, resulting in a year-on-year decrease in the total output. The Sanlin Farmers' Education Center, aware of this situation, convened farmers this spring before the sowing of melon crops to lecture and discuss planting methods, providing extremely detailed procedures. The general interest of farmers in planting melons has been revived. According to the center's survey, within the experimental district of three li, more than a hundred households have replanted watermelons, covering 400 mu of land. The growth is also quite healthy. Currently, the center has established the Sanlin Melon Transportation and Sales Limited Cooperative in order to reduce transportation costs and prevent exploitation. It has submitted a request to the county government to forward it to the municipal government for protection. From now on, Sanlintang watermelons will be revived in Shanghai.</p>

<p>At 10:30 PM on the 14th of this month, after Xu Amao's home at No. 186, Gui'an Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, French Concession, was broken into and robbed by armed bandits, the bandits fled with the loot. The victim followed behind them and reported to the patrolmen on Kai Zi Er Road, asking them to pursue the bandits. The bandits noticed and opened fire to resist arrest, causing a stray bullet to hit Sun Fengxiang (29 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a bungalow in Dunhou Lane, Kai Zi Er Road, working as a chauffeur for the Butterfly Bowtie Company), He Fengle (inspector at the Great World entertainment center), Ding Qiaosheng (waiter at the Yixing Noodle Restaurant), and three others. The police station sent the injured individuals to the hospital for treatment. The bandits fled to the intersection of Ai Duo Ya Road and Da Gu Road, where they were shot back by a Western patrolman and Chinese patrolman No. 587. One bandit was shot and injured, falling on the Public Concession side. The patrolmen seized his pistol, arrested him, and sent him to the Public Works Department prison hospital for treatment. It was determined that the bandit's name was Wang Jinsheng, 24 years old, from Changshu, a peddler. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. The other day, the French police sent Wang to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, and the police lawyer requested a postponement until the defendant and victims had recovered from their injuries before resuming the hearing. Judge Li Changnian reviewed the report and approved the request. Now, Sun Fengxiang, who was shot by the bandits, had already gone home to sleep that night. At around ten o'clock, he went out again to relieve himself in the Eight Immortals Bridge small vegetable market and was hit in the left waist by a stray bullet. The bullet did not penetrate, but his intestines were severed. He was treated at Guangci Hospital but died at 6:30 yesterday morning. The hospital notified the police station to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for a coroner's inquest, pending a report to the court for an examination today.</p>

Many people paid their respects along the way. The British and French police stations dispatched police officers to maintain order. Over a thousand people from all walks of life went to carry the ropes. The crowd of mourners was overwhelming, and the road was blocked.</p>

<p>Fifteen-Year-Old Steals Jewelry and Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday Took the Taiyuan Ship to Xiamen</p>
<p>Xu Jinzhang, a Cantonese man in his forties, has operated the Taichang Machinery Factory at the mouth of Fude Lane, Hengbang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, for several years. His business has been doing fairly well, and he has accumulated some savings. He has a son named Hongsheng, who is only fifteen years old and still in school. Unexpectedly, Mr. Xu passed away from illness in March of this year, leaving behind the Taichang Machinery Factory, which is now managed by his wife. Her son, seeing that his father had passed away, pretended to help his mother take care of the store and quit school, idling at home without learning or making progress. He spends his days wandering outside. Although his mother has repeatedly tried to persuade him, it has had no effect. She thinks he is her only son and there is nothing she can do. Unexpectedly, he recently met a Mr. Yi, also a Cantonese, about twenty years old, in a certain sports association. Mr. Yi was dressed in Western clothes and leather shoes. The two became friends at first sight. However, Mr. Yi thought that Hongsheng was young and foolish, so he tempted him in every way. Hongsheng secretly took his mother's gold bracelet, over eight hundred silver dollars, and a land deed for two fen, nine li, and three hao of land in Xu Houde Hall at No. 5, Baiziwei, Jiangwan, and ran away with Mr. Yi. Yesterday morning, the two boarded the Taigu Company's Taiyuan ship, having booked cabin No. 28 in first class, intending to go to Xiamen. After one of the youth's father's friends learned of this, he informed the youth's mother, who immediately sent someone to the Taiyuan ship to intercept them. When they arrived at the pier, the Taiyuan had already weighed anchor and left port, so they returned to the store and reported the matter. The youth's mother then reported the matter to the police station and requested the Women and Children's Relief Association to try to find them. She also planned to report the loss of the land deed to the Land Bureau.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Donation for national salvation by airplane is a trivial matter. Our factory has never used this as a means of publicity, so we have never published news to any party. However, today's newspaper carries all kinds of concerns about the Tianchu Factory, and news such as negotiating tax exemption with the Ministry of Finance, is as bizarre as the last time the Aviation Association negotiated with our factory to withdraw money. I am afraid that there will be misunderstandings. I hope that you will correct it. I wish you good writing. Sincerely, Management Office of Tianchu MSG Factory, 21st.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Series</p>
<p>An Abstract of the Analysis of the World Economic Panic Translated by Lu Guixiang. The whole book has 88 pages. The price of the paper cover in 32mo is 25 cents. The world economy has been mired in panic for nearly four years. During these four years, the world has been more disturbed and uneasy than ever before. Rulers of various countries have been running around calling for help, and have exhausted all methods to seek relief, but in the end, because of the various contradictions of their own cannot be eliminated, the result is that none of them have been effective. On the contrary, the process of panic is only getting deeper and deeper. Now the World Economic Conference is also being held. However, the inherent contradictions of capitalism have long doomed its historical fate. The convocation of the economic conference is nothing more than the final struggle, and there will be no good results there; The question currently before us is where will the world go in the future? We should pay close attention to this question. Especially for our backward China, what will be its future? What is its relationship with the world economy? We should especially study it carefully. This book is translated in response to this need. Although its position is said to be capitalist, its observation of the problem is somewhat incorrect, but the general claim is fair. Moreover, we cannot be biased in one aspect when studying each problem. In addition to the basic theory, we should include the opinions of other positive and negative aspects, and then compare the gains and losses to draw a correct conclusion. Therefore, we should pay close attention to the observations and opinions of bourgeois economists on the current economic panic, and this book is a representative work. The author of this book, Dr. Paul Einzing, is a famous economist of the world, and his works are as rich as forests. This book is also one of his most recent proud works. This book was published in 1929. In less than three years, it has been reprinted three times, and it is popular in Europe and the United States. Its value can be known. The book is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1: Introduction. Chapter 2: Causes of Panic. It is divided into 14 sections, which lists all the views of economists on the causes of panic, and discusses the gains and losses one by one. Chapter 3: The Way Out. Discusses the way out of the world economy in the future, and is divided into six sections, which discusses in detail the solutions to all aspects of the economic panic. Chapter 4: Future Prospects, is the conclusion of the whole book. How can the current world economic panic be resolved? In the end, he attributed it to the close cooperation of the world to save the danger of capitalism. He has a detailed narrative on this point. Between the lines, it seems that the future is very promising. Is there any hope? Is the capitalist cooperation he advocates possible in fact? Let's watch the facts quietly. However, in any case, this book is indeed a very valuable reading from its own position, especially when the World Economic Conference is being held. This book is very useful for studying the World Economic Conference. As for the clarity of chapters, the translation is simple and easy to understand, and there is no drawback of boredom and bitterness.</p>

<p>丨China's International Trade in the Past Ten Years丨</p>
<p>No matter which nation it is, they always like to buy goods from their own country to show their patriotism. Even if the goods produced in their own country are the worst and the most shoddy; they always argue that they are good and beautiful, just like "a bald man's son wearing flowers"!</p>
<p>However, the Chinese nation is very different, and is inversely proportional to foreigners: wearing a western suit, eating western food, living in a western-style house, taking a car, and household items are all foreign goods, not enough to show their extravagance 丨 Even for ordinary people, they are also full of foreign style, such as matches, kerosene, foreign lamps, foreign stoves, foreign socks, foreign umbrellas... none of them are non-foreign 丨 What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The meaning is simple. The national products of handicrafts adhere to the old methods left over from ancient times, do not seek improvement, have no scientific mind, and are always so lousy! Foreign goods can use machines to manufacture quickly and constantly transform them!</p>
<p>Constantly innovating! Then how can the national products that "do not advance will retreat" compare to even one ten thousandth of them! How can national products not fall</p>
<p>miles and miles 丨 Now I will briefly list the general situation of China's international trade in the past ten years to see the general decline of national products:</p>
<p>Year Total number of national product exports Total number of foreign product imports Total number of international trade 12 940 million taels 1.12 billion taels 1.88 billion taels 13 110 million taels 1.27 billion taels 194 million taels 14 140 million taels 1.21 billion taels 194 million taels 15 120 million taels 1.37 billion taels 218 million taels 16 121 million taels 1.3 billion taels 210 million taels 17 123 million taels 1.41 billion taels 222 million taels 18 125 million taels 1.48 billion taels 232 million taels 19 113 million taels 1.58 billion taels 223 million taels 20 119 million taels 1.63 billion taels 238 million taels 21 72 million taels 1.31 billion taels 175 million taels From this point of view, international trade has declined greatly in the past year. It can also be seen that the difference between the export of national products and the import of foreign products is very large! There is even a world of difference between international trade! The total number of international trade and national product exports differs by more than one time, which is shocking.</p>
<p>Are we going to let foreign goods import as much as they want, and let national goods decline and degenerate at all costs? Are we going to allow the economic aggression of the great powers to lead to the point of national subjugation and racial extinction? Otherwise, in this National Products Year, how should we turn over a new leaf, do our best to promote and transform, cater to the psychology of the masses, and seek perfect national products!</p>

<p>— Ms. Hu Louzhen</p>
<p>Lü'er hurried back from school, sweat still flowing from his head and cheeks, with some innocent worries on his face, looking like he wanted to cry but couldn't laugh! Running to his mother, he said with a hesitant tone:</p>
<p>"Mom! How am I?</p>
<p>"Today at school, I heard our Mr. Li say: 'Anyone who buys foreign goods, especially Japanese goods, will be fined a big ocean!' The money from the fines will be donated to the children's national salvation airplane!" "Good baby 丨 Although you are only eight or nine years old, you are very able to know how to love your country; In the past, when your father was still alive, he was a very enthusiastic person in promoting national products and resisting foreign goods, alas 丨 It's a pity that he is no longer in this world 丨 "</p>
<p>Lü'er's mother said to Lü'er in a comforting and regretful tone; Both mother and son shed tears, Lü'er was very calm, his eyes fixed on his mother, 丨 thoughtful.</p>
<p>"Good baby 丨 Before, when you were only five years old, I bought you a small flower umbrella made in Japan, and your father scolded me severely. I couldn't bear it at the time, so we had a big argument! Ah! Thinking about it now, I feel endless regret. Your father's intention was really good! ···· Ah! My baby, I only hope that you will continue your father's will, serve the society, vigorously promote national products, overthrow all foreign goods in the market, and don't send the pure white money to foreign devils to use! "</p>
<p>Lü'er was still listening silently, and a white cloud suddenly appeared on his red face; He lowered his head, thinking about what Mr. Li said, thinking about a large amount of money being sent to foreigners to use ········· It's really good, and it's really too dangerous!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Teachers and National Products Yin Pavilion <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Now that China is suffering from poverty and exhaustion due to the inflow of foreign goods, the customs cannot increase taxes as much as possible for a while to stop the endless dumping of foreign goods. Our own industry cannot fully supply the needs of our country. Therefore, for this domestic product, which is half machine-made and half hand-made, the customs cannot fully protect it. Only when the people are determined to purchase and use domestic products can it be saved.</p>
<p>However, the general people are very scattered. If you want to have considerable effectiveness, it is better for the teachers of all schools in the country to swear to purchase and use domestic products, and also order students to purchase and use domestic products, and persuade the people to also purchase and use domestic products. Then this invisible force is really great. Teachers, don’t underestimate your own status. You must know that the uncrowned emperor who protects national products is the teacher. Teachers actually hold the supreme power to protect national products, which cannot be prohibited by treaties and cannot be reached by military force. Even if the imperialists are very fierce and capable, they cannot interfere with the teachers' protection of national products. Teachers, please recognize your own position, recognize your own strength, and work hard to serve the country!</p>

<h3 id="e193">My country's mosquito incense business (below) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>Japanese mosquito incense is sold in Korea, India, and the South Seas Islands. Naturally, China, a country with backward industries, is also its only sales tail. Before May Fourth, Japan's mosquito incense sold to China was always more than 1 million yuan per year. After the anti-Japanese trend arose, the Chinese people woke up from their dreams and knew that to resist other countries' goods, they must first seek their own production. Therefore, domestic mosquito incense came into being. The first person to successfully imitate new-style mosquito incense was the Shanghai China Chemical Industry Society. Mr. Fang Yexian, the general manager of the society, went to Japan several times to study the cultivation of Japanese pyrethrum. After returning, he vigorously promoted and advocated planting, on the one hand, opened his own pyrethrum farm and hired experts to guide planting, and on the other hand, widely persuaded rural farmers to plant and buy them at a good price. Such efforts to advocate were quite successful in a few years. Up to now, the Samsung brand mosquito incense produced by the society has been sold all over the country, with annual sales of more than 400,000, and has replaced the position of the Japanese goods Pig brand mosquito incense. Secondly, the invincible brand of bulk mosquito incense is cheaper because of the savings in decoration, so people in the society are also happy to purchase it. As for the Yue Lizhang brand of Yonghe Industrial Company, the Golden Spider brand of Dacheng Factory, and the Earth brand of Wuzhou Pharmacy, the annual sales are very considerable. In addition, there are quite a few small-scale manufacturers, which are difficult to investigate for a while. For example, some incense shops in Wuxi, Danyang, Zhenjiang and other places are also producing mosquito incense. Unfortunately, it is always because the raw materials are impure and the efficacy is reduced, resulting in the loss of the faith of purchasers. Finally, what I hope that domestic merchants must pay attention to is: although mosquito incense is a thing that domestic products can supply the needs of the general people, there are still many things to be worked hard by domestic merchants. We should actively expand to the outside world. For example, there are millions of overseas Chinese on the Nanyang Islands, and they are still painfully purchasing enemy goods; The reason is that domestic products are too expensive, and they also dislike the unfashionable decoration. If domestic product manufacturers want to develop further, they should put some effort into these places, at least to achieve the purpose of "Chinese people using Chinese goods"! Especially the supply of raw materials, the output of our country is not enough. Now, because of the boycott of enemy goods, various factories have to purchase from the United Kingdom and the United States. This outflow of rights and interests, domestic product manufacturers should continue to work hard to seek self-help! At the same time, I hope that those who advocate improving rural production should also unite to help promote the work of planting pyrethrum.</p>

<p>— Ms. Baipeng</p>
<p>丨May all the little sisters in the country do this丨</p>
<p>Sister Peng:</p>
<p>Although I am a girl who is still in my childhood, I am confident that I will not lag behind in loving my country! What grieves me the most is that the general shameless young men and women only shout about loving the country, but when it comes to their actual actions, you can immediately find their own contradictions! ! ! Isn't it? I didn't know about the slogan of boycotting foreign goods and promoting domestic goods in the past. It was in the year of the Republic of China when I was eight years old that I couldn't understand the meaning of promoting domestic goods, but I understood that this was a unanimous call for a moment in the country. I heard that it soon disappeared like smoke and clouds, which is so sad! Since then, I have encountered the "Jinan Massacre" on May 3 of the Republic of China, the "Wanbaoshan Massacre" of the Republic of China, the "September 18th Incident", and the serious national disaster from the "January 28th Incident" last year until now. Which time has not been excited for a while because of the serious stimulus? Which time has the high-profile promotion of national products and boycott of foreign goods been effective? ····</p>
<p>Ah! My sister Baipeng! Although I am young, but when I see such social people's hearts dominating such a serious national disaster, who would not be grieved? We don't need to blame others, we only blame ourselves for not being competitive! We swear from today on that we don't need to bring out all the old tricks of "singing high-profile" anymore. We only hope that everyone will do what we can do in a down-to-earth way! ! ! Promoting national products and refusing to use enemy goods is the mission we should bear during this national disaster! Sister Peng! There is no other intention in this letter. It is best if it can be made public. Otherwise, please show my enthusiasm for promoting national products to your classmates and see if they sympathize with me? I won't talk too much. Please write back and guide me!

<p>— Liang Yiqun</p>
<p>Madam Wang was a modern young woman, and also a top-notch saleswoman of foreign goods. In her mind, foreign goods were always exquisite, unlike the crudeness of domestic goods, and only imported goods were worthy of being called fashionable; therefore, all daily necessities, clothing, etc. in her home were imported.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was henpecked, so although he didn't approve of his wife's worship of foreign goods, he didn't dare to utter a word. One afternoon, Zhang Zaifeng delivered a set of white pongee children's clothing, which she had recently made for her only beloved son, Yun'er. She thought: When her son gets home from school and sees this new outfit, how happy he will be!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Yun'er, who usually came back jumping and skipping, was silent today. He came in, threw down his schoolbag, and pouted, as if he was quarreling with someone.</p>
<p>"Child, is someone bullying you? Tell Mom! ... Mom made you a new outfit, are you happy?" Madam Wang comforted her beloved son as she opened the wrapped, brand-new white pongee children's clothing and held it up high for Yun'er to see.</p>
<p>"Who wants new clothes? And made of foreign goods! These harmful foreign goods, I don't want to wear them!" Yun'er glanced at it and said resentfully. "Child, foreign goods are very exquisite, look how beautiful this one is, how can domestic goods be so good-looking? ... Child, tell me, who said something to you?"</p>
<p>"Rongsheng said that everything I wear is foreign goods, and he scolded me as a 'little traitor'; I went with him to tell Mr. Wu, and Mr. Wu said that we shouldn't wear foreign goods, wearing foreign goods is shameful; we have good domestic goods, why don't we buy them? Some domestic goods are also very good-looking; giving money to foreigners, foreigners will buy guns and cannons to fight us, so foreign goods are harmful things. Mom, I don't want to wear these harmful foreign goods!"</p>
<p>".................."</p>
<p>"Mom, why aren't you saying anything? If you really don't make me a set of domestic goods, they will scold me as a little traitor again; it's really embarrassing to be scolded by them..." Yun'er stamped his feet and cried.</p>
<p>"Good boy, be good, don't cry! Mom will make you a set of domestic clothing, okay?" Madam Wang was anxious and quickly picked up her beloved son, patting him.</p>
<p>"Mom, make it for me right away! We will never buy foreign goods again from now on. Mom's clothes should also be made of domestic goods, wouldn't that be good?" Yun'er stopped crying and said.</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom will do as you say, we will buy all domestic goods from now on." Madam Wang seemed to realize the inappropriateness of her blind infatuation with foreign goods, so she said resolutely; as she wiped away the tears from the corners of Yun'er's eyes.</p>
<p>Yun'er was happy and snuggled in his mother's arms, smiling.</p>

<p>Each set will be bound into 1,500 volumes.</p>
<p>A maximum of 1,500 sets will be printed.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported that the National Government's plan to print unpublished rare manuscripts from the Siku Quanshu in facsimile has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and that Chiang Fu-tsung, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Central Library, was specially appointed by the Ministry of Education to come to Shanghai and sign a formal contract with the Commercial Press for printing and distribution. According to Wang Yun-wu, General Manager of the Press, in a formal statement to a reporter from the New Voice Society, the reports in the newspapers today regarding this matter differ somewhat from the facts. A reporter visited yesterday and was received by Mr. Hsu Lien-seng, a staff member of the Press. What was reported was not based on my conversation. In fact, the number of copies to be printed will be determined after considering the number of pre-orders. The amount of paper to be used is related to the number of books printed, so it is difficult to estimate at this time. As for the number of sets to be donated to the Central Library, it will be guaranteed to be one-tenth of the actual number printed. The original text of the contract has been obtained and is disclosed below:</p>
<p>Contract between the National Central Library Preparatory Office and the Shanghai Commercial Press. Both parties agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Ministry of Education commissions the National Central Library Preparatory Office (hereinafter referred to as "the Library") to enter into a contract with the Shanghai Commercial Press (hereinafter referred to as "the Press") to photographically reproduce and publish the unpublished rare woodblock editions from the Wen Yuan Ge Siku Quanshu in a small 16mo format.</p>

<p>Article 4: During the photographing process, the Palace Museum, together with the Library, shall send personnel to check and hand over the books to be photographed by the Press each day. Once the photographing is completed each day, the Press shall return the books immediately. The Press shall only be relieved of responsibility after the Palace Museum and the Library have sent personnel to the site to verify the count without error.</p>

<p>Article 6: All printing costs shall be borne by the Press. The Library shall not be responsible for any profits or losses.</p>

If the number of copies printed is less than 300, at least 30 copies shall still be donated. The maximum number of copies to be photographically reproduced shall be 1,500.</p>
<p>Article 11: The Press shall not extract and print separate single volumes from the complete set. Each set must be stamped by the Library before it can be sold. However, in the event of unavoidable accidents and not due to the fault of the Press, and the photographing cannot be completed, the Press may request the Ministry of Education to allow it to print the photographed books as single volumes and sell them directly, and shall still donate to the Library in accordance with the provisions of Article 10.</p>
<p>Article 12: The copyright of the entire publication shall belong to the Library, which entrusts the Press to print and distribute it.</p>
<p>Article 13: Special care should be taken during the photographing process to avoid soiling or damaging the manuscripts. If any damage occurs, the Press shall compensate by copying the damaged page in the same format and returning the damaged original page.</p>
<p>Article 14: This contract grants the Press the right to print this book for one edition only. If a reprint is necessary, both parties shall negotiate and enter into a separate contract.</p>
<p>Article 15: This contract is made in duplicate, one copy to be submitted by the Library to the Ministry of Education, and one copy to be retained by the Press.</p>

<p>Japanese Cunningly Intend to Make Things Difficult for the Chinese Association</p>
<p>Yesterday's lawn tennis matches were all postponed due to wet ground. The Chinese Association proposed to hold the match between the Chinese Association and the Japanese Association today, but the Japanese Association refused. Their intention is obviously to wait until Qiu Fei-hai, Lin Baohua, and others from the Chinese Association have left for Sichuan before playing the match. Because after May Fourth, the strength of the Chinese team will be greatly reduced, and the hope of winning the championship will be minimal, while the Japanese Association can take advantage of it. It is hoped that Lin, Qiu, and others will consider the Chinese Association, the reputation of the tennis community, and postpone their departure so that they can play the Japanese Association and the Japanese internal and external yarn factories before going to Sichuan. If they do so, the two Japanese teams will inevitably concede defeat and greatly satisfy the people. It is also heard that Yu Tian-guang and Qian Yao-bin will accompany Lin and Qiu to Sichuan, while Jiang Dao-zhang and Zheng Zhao-jia have decided not to go.</p>

<p>Departing This Morning</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Sports Normal School basketball team in this city has fought on the field for a long time and is known for its strong strength, both domestically and internationally. In recent years, they have fought north to Tianjin and Beijing, and east to Japan, always returning with honor and glory. The sports community regards them as the iron army in basketball. Although the graduates of the past, such as Xi Jun and others, have left the school, the rising stars who follow are still continuously emerging. In the spring of this year, the school's basketball team had a grand plan to tour Europe and America, but due to the deepening Japanese aggression in the north, the plan could not be realized and had to be postponed. In March and May, they received repeated urgings from famous figures in the sports communities of Fujian and Guangdong provinces to visit the two provinces for friendly matches. Principal Lu Li-hua was also invited to serve as a lecturer at the provincial summer sports training class organized by the Guangdong Education Department during the summer vacation. Therefore, she very much wanted the team to visit the two provinces to exchange basketball skills and seek guidance. Taking advantage of the remaining time of the summer vacation, they will carry out the expedition. The team will depart this morning on the Zhesedanieri mail ship. The hosts and guides in Fujian Province are Xue Leng-song of the Jiangsheng Newspaper, Deng Shi-xi of the Sports Association, Huang Bing-kun of Xiamen University, Ye Cai-zhen of Jimei School, and alumni Zhuang Shu-yu and Wang Lan, who are currently teaching at Yude Women's Middle School. In Guangdong Province, Xu Min-yi, the director of the Public Sports Experimental Zone, will contact the participating teams. The team leader is Shao Jin-ying, the general manager is Gao Zhao-lie, the captain is Yang Sen, and the team members are Chen Rong-ming, Huang Shu-hua, Pan Meng, Chen Ju-cai, Shi Rui-xia, Chen Xiu-zhang, Xiao Zhong-qiong, and Yang Zhi. The school's alumni in Fujian and Guangdong provinces have also sent letters and telegrams urging them to depart as soon as possible, expressing their great joy.</p>

<p>— Lily</p>
<p>In the eyes of foreigners, Chinese people are associated with "bound feet," "queues," "opium smoking," "spitting," "farting," and "unpatriotic" behavior, with nothing commendable. The only "different" and "pleasing" trait is the "love for foreign goods."</p>
<p>"High-class Chinese" love "Western goods," while those below them, from "boycott overseas" to "coolies," love "Eastern goods" or use both "Eastern goods" and "Western goods." Although the products bear the phrase "Made in China" in foreign languages, indicating a "foreign touch," the upper, middle, and lower classes generally think, "Oh, domestic goods, humph!"</p>
<p>Chinese people are truly "blessed like the East Sea." These years, they are suffering from "expensive gold and cheap silver," unable to afford foreign goods. Coincidentally, foreigners are experiencing a "surplus of production," and their eyes are set on the "foreign-loving" Chinese people, "selling lamb at the price of dog meat," and "dumping at any cost."</p>
<p>"Russian goods" want to squeeze out "Western goods," "Eastern goods" want to overthrow "Russian goods," and "Western goods" want to drive away "Eastern goods." You are having a "clearance sale of inventory," I am "treating customers preferentially with a buy-one-get-one-free offer," and he is having a "cheap sale of good goods with extra gifts." "Since I have to buy it anyway, might as well get it cheap." "When the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman benefits." Foreigners are ultimately benefiting because of the reckless "dumping," China "can reduce the outflow of several million yuan each year."</p>
<p>"The Tianjin-Beijing war has ended." The long "national crisis" is beginning to show a glimmer of hope. We, the masters of the Republic of China who tremble with fear of becoming "slaves of a conquered nation," can temporarily stop "lying on firewood (lying high and drawing salary is an exception) for several years." Since "resisting foreign aggression" has "come to an end," "internal peace" has also "greatly improved." "Harmony is in the air," perhaps "the world will be at peace" soon, and we should also "enjoy ourselves in time," without having to "scrimp and save" anymore, busy with "comforting" here and "donating" there.</p>
<p>How to "enjoy ourselves in time?" To be frank, see through things, "spend money today if you have it," buy some food you haven't eaten, buy some clothes you haven't worn, buy some things you haven't used.</p>
<p>"Western goods," "Eastern goods," and "Russian goods" are all having "massive sales." Everything to eat, wear, and use is available. In order to "reduce the outflow of several million yuan each year," from "high-class Chinese" to "boycott overseas" to "coolies," everyone should stand at attention, raise their hands, and welcome them.</p>
<h3 id="e233">The Lives of Traveling Performers <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Nan</p>
<p>Traveling performers are the kind who make a living with art. Among them, there are many young girls with both beauty and talent, performing amazing stunts. However, life in such troupes is very painful. The troupe leader only cares about winning the audience's appreciation and earning more rewards, so they spur them on to perform hard. Even if they have some pain or discomfort, they are not allowed to rest. Although the troupe leader's methods are cruel, there is no choice given the necessity of making a living. Sometimes, if they are unlucky, local bullies will force them to be their concubines. The troupe, relying on them as money trees, would never agree. But the bullies' evil power is very strong, and they find various ways to ruin them. The troupe cannot stand their ground and has no choice but to wander elsewhere.</p>
<p>Regarding traveling performances, there is also a more romantic and meaningful thing. A young man from a family of scholars and etiquette fell in love with a performing girl, and their love burned like fire. In the era of the shackles of the old moral teachings, he was actually able to break through the boundaries of social class, obtain the consent of his parents, break off his engagement with his betrothed wife, and resolutely marry this performing girl as his wife. Not only did he not despise her profession, but he also encouraged her to help him improve his art into a noble and educational entertainment.</p>
<p>These days, the new film "The Road to Fitness" by the Star Film Company is being shown at the New Light Grand Theater. It takes the theme of traveling performance. Ms. Xu Qin-fang plays the performing girl, and her performance is lively and can fully reveal the estimation of a traveling wanderer. This film, whether in terms of consciousness or technique, is worth seeing.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Anecdotes of Wang Yin-cai <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Wang Yin-cai passed away last week at his home in Shuangqiao, Nanxiang. It is said that when the coffin was being prepared, there was a heavy thunderstorm. The body, which was originally stout, had a belly as large as a five-stone gourd, and could not be</p>
<p>enclosed. Later, the craftsman was instructed to hollow out an inch and a half from the bottom of the coffin before it could be sealed. Alas, this is indeed strange!</p>
<p>Wang initially took education as his responsibility. For thirty years, he was quite well-known in Shanghai, especially in the local area. Whenever he lectured, he would say: "I am a bat." This is because he was born in Jiading, but he entered the Shanghai register for the boy's exam. Four years ago, with the qualification of a teacher, he became the head of Wu County. At that time, Shen Xin-gong and Gu Yin-ting from my county, and others, all boarded sedan chairs to hold official posts and entered the political world. Wang's term of office was longer than Gu Shen's in Wujin and Nanhui. When he resigned, it was said that it was due to the collection of the "power rice" that he was hit by the farmers' association and left. He described that in the Su County government office, he had no free time all day long and suffered a lot. He often used calligraphy and painting to entertain himself. One day, someone brought a large ancient painting, and after examining it for a long time, he took out 800 gold to pay for it. Before long, he knew it was a fake, but it was too late. The money he spent on such things was a large portion of his official wealth.</p>
<p>When he was young, he occasionally uttered obscene words. His father, Gu Sheng, lightly tapped his head with the mouth of a smoking pipe and said, "What are you saying?" His father forbade hitting the head when teaching children, but only allowed slapping the palm and the leg, and did not allow slapping the palm. Using the pipe mouth was strict but contained love. Therefore, Wang had the deepest understanding of teaching methods from his father's teachings. Gu Sheng once recited Wu Meicun's poem: "Do you not see the white waves stirring the sky, a single leaf is in danger. Putting away the reeds, I am still afraid the boat will be slow. People in the world have endless troubles, better to tell the fishing old man of the rivers and lakes," to warn his three sons, but he did not expect that Wang would also enter the political sea for a time. When the bad news reached Shanghai this time, his beloved concubine learned of it and went to Xiang, but was discovered by the wife and was not allowed to enter the door. Later,</p>
<p>a relative paved the way for her, and she was able to weep and bow before the coffin in the name of a female disciple.</p>

<p>face, and everything changed accordingly: Look, isn't the street full of flags with "ice" written on them?</p>
<p>The three major companies also hung out the "Summer Sale" banner in time, fluttering, fluttering, attracting those bargain hunters. The windowsills are full of summer supplies, grass hats, bowler hats, voile, mosquito coils. ... The most popular one should be the swimming suit promotional advertisement of XX Company. Many people are attracted to stop and watch, who doesn't praise it, well made! Unfortunately, these people who appreciate them do not have the ability to buy these goods, I think this advertisement does not have much effect!</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller flows to see the sweat, running non-stop, sitting on it are young ladies, grandmothers, wearing thin voile; genuine goods! The red powder color of the flesh can be seen vaguely, the towering breasts seem to want to break through the gauze and walk out, 丨curve beauty, the name of art! Suddenly came a gust of wind, blowing up their gowns, ah! No pants on! Not a bit wrong; you see, you can't see any pants all the way up the thigh!</p>
<p>Our modern guys, wearing the starched straight 1933 summer clothes, (naturally a suit), stepping on multi-colored leather shoes, slip past the sidewalk with a fox-like pace, causing the country bumpkins along the way to look on with awe and envy.</p>
<p>The radio broadcasts the summer sale of a certain company in a certain place, the advertisements for a certain brand of soda, fresh orange and lemon water. Summer Street is full of heat, noise, temptation.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: A Jocular Remark Is Not Without Cause; Secret Arrangement of a Son-in-Law, A Sudden Arrival; The Tutor Is At Leisure and Respected</p>
<p>Ban left and led Zhao Ziqiang in. He was very polite, rushing in through the door and shaking hands with Gan Erye several times. Then he smiled and said, "Brother, I am being very presumptuous in coming here. Please forgive me." Although Ji Zhi disliked soldiers, he couldn't help but greet such a friendly person with a smile. He moved a chair and asked him to sit down, smiling and saying, "For people like us who are staying in a guild hall, it's already very good to have friends visit. How dare we mention the word 'presumptuous'?" As he spoke, he seemed to remember something and immediately picked up two books to cover something on the table. Before the books were completely down, Zhao Ziqiang had already clearly seen that there was a pawn ticket on the table with two stacks of silver dollars on top. Gan Ji Zhi put the books down to cover the pawn ticket, pretending to be very casual. From this, it was clear that he desperately wanted to hide his poverty. Looking around the room, besides two square stools and two semi-old trunks stacked by the bedside, there were no other valuable items. The bed was basically just a wooden frame. There was no tablecloth on the square table, just a thick layer of newspapers. But there were many books piled up in a mess. From this, one could also see how poor he was. This completely dispelled Zhao Ziqiang's original idea that he had been promoted. So he smiled at him and said, "My coming today is indeed a bit presumptuous, but I have some business to discuss." Ji Zhi smiled and said, "Company Commander Zhao, just tell me what you want." As he spoke, he picked up the old teapot from the corner of the table, poured a cup of plain boiled water, and placed it in front of Zhao Ziqiang. He smiled and said, "I'm really sorry. When you come to a place like mine, there's not even tea or cigarettes." Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said, "Please don't be so polite. If I were being polite, I wouldn't have come so presumptuously. I've already told the old lady Yang what you asked me to convey last time. What did she say?" As he spoke, he watched Ji Zhi's face. Ji Zhi smiled and said, "I guessed they wouldn't say anything." Zhao Ziqiang said, "Isn't Mr. Gan living with your brother in Haidian? Why did you move into the city alone? Do you have a good job?" (107)</p>

<h3 id="e237">Idle Chat About Red Beans (Part 1) <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Red beans, also known as love seeds, are produced in Lingnan. They are woody vines, with trunks more than ten feet tall. The leaves are pinnately compound, and they bloom with small flowers in autumn. The corolla is butterfly-shaped, white or light red. The fruit forms pods, as large as peas, slightly flat, and bright red, sometimes half red and half black. Legend has it that someone died on the border, and his wife missed him so much that she cried under a tree and died. Hence the name. Since the Tang Dynasty, poets have often praised them.</p>
<p>Guangdong New Language: The wood grain of the love seed is similar to that of the locust tree. Large ones, when sawn diagonally, have fine floral patterns, also called chicken wing wood, because their grain resembles it.</p>
<p>Tao Hongjing’s Brief Talk on Red Beans: Red beans are also called love seeds, their color is red, moist and dripping. The flowers are like catalpa, the pods are small like locust horns, and they bear fruit once every few years. Wang Wei of the Tang Dynasty has a poem entitled "Acacia": "Red beans grow in the southern country, How many branches will sprout in the spring? I hope you pick them abundantly, This thing evokes the most yearning." In the Tang Dynasty, this thing was already regarded as a fine product.</p>
<p>Wen Tingyun’s "New Tune, Willow Branches": "Exquisite dice inlaid with red beans, Do you know how deep is the yearning that penetrates the bones?" Red bean yearning can penetrate deep into the bones.</p>
<p>Xue Tian’s poem: "Elegant shops pile up red beans, A潇洒courtyard reflects bright green, This scene and this feeling, make people yearn."</p>
<p>Wang Chan Hong's personal poem: "Behind the screen, recording tunes and picking red beans, Under the window, copying books and dyeing green bananas." Where is the individual? Making people think, a finishing touch, the sentence is also well-crafted.</p>
<p>Chen Yunping’s "Spring Returns": "After the swallows return, Seeking red beans under the leaves of yearning," The artistic conception, vividly portrayed.</p>
<p>In Gong Ding'an's collection of Wang Ci Hui’s poems, the words "red bean" often appear, mostly untitled love poems, using the words "red bean" as a decorative element. The Red Bean Mountain Villa, during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, was the library of Hui Dong in Wuxian. There is a three-volume catalog of the Hundred-Year Hall books. According to Hui, there is a Red Bean Villa, north of the Lengxiang Creek in the southeast of Suzhou City. It was originally Dongchan Temple, with a red bean tree planted by Master White Pigeon, which rotted with age, but new branches sprouted again. Hui Zhouxiang planted a branch in front of the steps and called himself the Master of the Red Bean. Monk Mu Cun painted a picture of the new residence of the Red Bean, as seen in Lang Ji’s hearsay. Therefore, the library is also named Red Bean. Red Bean Villa, the residence of Qian Qianyi, the late Mu Zhai in the Qing Dynasty, is located in Changshu County, also named because of the red bean trees there. Qianyi called himself the Red Bean Elder.</p>
<p>Once, Master White Pigeon of Lichen Temple in Wumen, accidentally picked up a red bean and planted it in the temple, pointing and instructing it: "You should grow quickly, but you must not bloom without reason in the future. There are big and small changes in the world, so the blooming of flowers will be sparse or dense," as seen in Niu Xiu's anthology. The ruins of Dongchan Temple are unknown, but the red bean tree still exists, now belonging to Xu Qizhong's family, and its location is near Fengmen in Suzhou. Master White Pigeon entrusted the changes of the world to the red beans, holding them accountable for their density, the old monk is too ignorant of things. A smile.</p>
<p>Legend has it that there are only three red bean trees in the world, one in Changshu, which is the so-called Red Bean Mountain Villa, one in Suzhou, which is the property of Xu Qizhong's family. One in Wenzhou, there is no record, it cannot be verified, this is what Xu Qizhong said in his Red Bean Trivia. As far as I know, there is also one tree in Gushan, Jiangyin, and one tree in Yongning Village, Shantang, Mudu Town, Suzhou. I have not seen the red bean tree in Gushan, but I saw the red bean tree in Mudu last summer. The tree is tall, but there are not many fruits, and the color is light and less round.</p>
<p>The anthology states: "Once there was a grieving woman who looked forward to her husband's return every day, shedding tears under a tree, her blood dyed the branches, which then formed seeds. This is the origin of the love seed. The poet entrusts things in the poem "Southern Country", which cannot be taken as fact."</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong has a red bean poem: "Holding the parrot grain, three points of jealousy, The heart penetrates the rhinoceros, a little infatuation," Comparing the red bean to the parrot grain, there is the thinking of Yishan's Brocade Zither. Han Yun Yuan Kewen once founded the Red Bean Newspaper with Yu Yifen, but it died after a few issues. The name "Red Bean" makes me feel infinitely nostalgic. Now the literary friends are old, and the clouds have returned. Praising a certain gentleman's poem mourning Yuan, there is a line "A lifetime of business, how many red skirts?", Can Xinling poison wine women, get what they want? I can't help but feel emotional about it. In the past, Han Yun once asked me for a pair of red beans, through the introduction of Jin friend Chen Jun. Now that Han Yun has passed away, I wonder if the pair of red beans are still there?</p>
<p>Hua Dabai obtained a pair of red beans from Zhou Gangzhi of Jiangyin, and there are three Double Red Bean tunes. Now I excerpt a few sentences, saying: "A good name called Red Bean," saying: "Afraid of planting the seeds of yearning," saying: "Double red beans stored in a brocade pouch," saying: "Relying on this to convey yearning." The beans are passed down through people, and people are passed down through words, I am fortunate for the red beans. Gangzhi became a martyr, and Dabai's tomb is also covered with green grass. I heard that Dabai was very lonely after his death, making people lament that literati are often poor.</p>

After the first hour, Hengxing sold from time to time, and the situation still did not show any signs of falling. Bingxing also sold, but with the support of goods and retail investors, it hovered around $8.90 for a long time. Later, due to news from foreign telegrams that the United States wanted to restrict production and raise prices, Dade Cheng Yuanmao sold, and more hands were disposed of, so it fell back to $5.50.

<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar market was sluggish due to various commercial goods and the relationship between the lack of funds, resulting in the daily interest rate being uniformly loose and constant. Yesterday, the morning and noon market interest rates were still only 7%, which was the same as the day before yesterday, and the situation was weak, with the possibility of further decline.

<p>Yesterday, the small foreign dollars in Jiangnan were scarce in transactions, and people's hearts were indifferent, so the market price had few competitors. As a result, the morning and noon markets were still slightly 4 points smaller than the previous day, calculated to be 850 yuan and 1 point, making a transaction. The morning market was 7,000 points, and the noon market was 3,500 points. The small foreign dollars in Guangdong were also the same in the morning and noon markets, at 773 yuan and 5 points, and there was no difference from the previous day's market price.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market turned tired and slightly chaotic. The bulls also came out, and the code felt loose and excessive. The shorts still watched. The Northern Gang also sold. Although there was no change in the situation, the flood situation had become a reality, and people's hearts were inevitably weak. At the opening of the market in the morning, the initial bid increased by 12 points to 4 points for the disarmament. When shooting 19 Guan, the sale was still abundant, and it gradually returned to fatigue, as if there was a squeeze of the bulls. The secondary market was the most chaotic, with ups and downs, with small ones ranging from 1 point to 2 points, and涨者also around 1 point. In the afternoon, most of the two markets were the bulls coming out, each market was small by 23 points. As a result, most of them fell by 23 points to 78 points, and the whole six alone fell by 1 yuan and 1 point. The market price suddenly rose and fell. The first and previous two days were completely opposite. Squeezing shorts and squeezing bulls were particularly superficial. The fact that the market price has reached a high point, and the 20-year finance and disaster relief public bonds are all in urgent need of sale in the market. The foreign troubles seem to have come to an end. The domestic situation is full of holes and wounds. The number of spot goods sold at high prices is also huge. Therefore, the future trend of squeezing shorts and squeezing bulls may still not be consistent. The total number of transactions was 11.167 million yuan, including 12,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures salt tax accounted for 3.73 million, disarmament accounted for 1.77 million, 19 Guan accounted for 1.5 million, and 20 volumes and 20 Guan accounted for 2.12 million. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to 340,000. 96 still had as many as 785,000.</p>

<p>丨Hankou Factory Has A Large Number Of Existing Cotton Transported To Shanghai For Sale Said丨 The yarn market fell in the morning and rose at noon, but the situation was still weak. Because the current yarn business was not smooth, and the bottom goods were thick, the bulls cut off, and the market plate was still tired. A yarn and flower store in Hankou, due to insufficient turnover, liquidated standard yarn and flower bulls at the market price, so people's hearts shook. It is heard that the Sanya Yarn Exchange in Osaka, East Ocean, has changed the standard for standard issues, and is auctioning 32-branch fine yarn as the standard.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Bull Liquidation Standard Yarn <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>

<p>The cotton market's decline is quite fierce, and the situation is progressing softly day by day. Because the yarn market is falling day by day, the factory's losses are too huge, so there is absolutely no intention to do anything about the raw materials. Moreover, Indian cotton is becoming cheaper and cheaper, and American cotton is also in a tired state, so some foreign merchants are selling short. There is news that a large amount of cotton from Hankou is coming to Shanghai for sale, and the future situation is still difficult to look good.</p>

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was more than 20 numbers, and the guests on this street were not many. The source was relatively scarce, and the market situation had no major ups and downs. Changbang japonica rice and Xitang Liantang thin rice were all settled. Sutongbang and Nangang thick japonica rice prices were slightly tired. Only Du Yangjian was in short supply and was very outstanding. Although the bag stomach had both north and south ocean operations, Jinbang only accepted Qingjiao Chong special goods, and Fuzhoubang handled Songjiang Zhong. The cargo was three loads, a total of six to seven hundred bags, and the guests' eating price was harsh, causing the market to be slightly angular. The variable yuan goods lacked a few points higher, and the yin yuan had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang in Heda was more than 20 numbers, and the white japonica rice in the market continued to be delivered, and the market shape was soft in the high and medium range. The early thin japonica rice was settled, and the Yangjian continued to have a source, and the scattered stomach was also transformed. The price and shape were fixed, and the port Du Kejian had no ups and downs. Although there were not many white yuan, the scattered dismantling was quiet, and the market was tired.</p>

<p>15,000 bags arriving in Shanghai from Saigon. The "Ke Xian" rice market has completely stalled. For months, "Ke Xian" has been a bestseller handled by Fujian merchants. As the amount of Fujian rice decreases daily, the "Ke Xian" market has also become increasingly sluggish. Yesterday, the supply of Fujian rice completely stopped, and there were no transactions for "Ke Xian" rice. Even "Che Xian", "Du Jian", and "Yang Jian" Ke Xian were weak. The whole market saw only 316 bags of Wuxi coarse rice handled by the Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants, priced at $6.35 per bag. There were no other transactions. "Foreign rice," on the other hand, has become lively. Two batches of Saigon No. 1 new rice have recently arrived in Shanghai, totaling 15,000 bags, all handled by foreign merchants. The asking price is very high, and no sales have been made yet. Local merchants are quite interested. Yesterday, the Zhejiang route saw excellent sales. Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants handled 2,200 bags of small "Jiao" rice, priced at $6.65 per bag. Additionally, 560 bags of Zhongguan large "Jiao" rice were handled by Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants. Due to active demand, the price of small "Jiao" rice has increased by five cents.</p>

<p>The flour market opened this morning with prices initially flat, then trending upwards. As foreign wheat quotations rebounded by about 3-4 cents, the market appeared weak at the open. However, after the second session, prices steadily rose. As floods in various provinces are becoming a reality, people inside and outside the industry are inevitably fearful. Northern merchants are also actively trading, leading to a gradual increase in market activity. By the afternoon opening, all months had resumed their upward trend. Tianjin, Shandong, and local speculators were all actively buying, and rumors of Japanese merchants buying old wheat further fueled sentiment. Prices briefly stabilized after a major factory released its holdings. Looking ahead, if the floods in various provinces do not expand, the rumors should subside, and the market will not see runaway price increases. As a result, June and July contracts rose 2.25 cents compared to the previous day, August and September contracts rose 2.5 cents, October contracts rose 2.25 cents, and November contracts rose 1.5 cents.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened this morning with prices initially flat, then steadily rising. As foreign wheat quotations fell by 3-4 cents, concerns about unfavorable weather and potential floods in various provinces led some speculators to actively buy, and those shorting the market rushed to cover their positions, resulting in a significant price increase. By the afternoon opening, the flour market was also strong, and rumors of Japanese merchants secretly inspecting old wheat caused market anxiety, leading to a sharp rise in prices. However, these events are currently only rumors, and the overall price trend remains uncertain. As a result, July contracts rose 7 cents compared to the previous day, August contracts rose 8 cents, September contracts rose 9 cents, October contracts rose a significant 11 cents, and November contracts rose 10 cents. The current wheat market remains flat for mid-grade and low-grade wheat, while high-grade wheat is slightly active. Wheat from Jiangyan, Huangqiao, and Dongtai is quoted at $3.75, Taizhou and Liuhe wheat at $3.60, Hezhou wheat at $3.68, Wuhu wheat at $3.71, Nanjing wheat at $3.60, Pukou wheat at $3.75 to $3.60, Yangzhou wheat at $3.68, Penglai wheat at $3.50, Zhitang wheat at $3.65, and Kunshan wheat at $3.70 to $3.65, totaling 8,500 bags handled by Fuxin, Fufeng, Shenda, and Huafeng.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended slightly higher due to the rebound in bid prices. The Association's benchmark price for ordinary 24 white sugar was $19.88 per bag, with several hundred bags traded, up 3.8 cents from the previous day.

<p>Merchants from Chongqing, Chengdu, and other regions have begun to purchase shoe-making felt and broadcloth. Both multi-colored and plain jacquard fabrics have been traded, but prices vary widely. Some are selling for 4.7-4.8 taels of silver, others for 5.3-5.5 taels of silver, and some are asking as much as 7.25 taels of silver. Foreign firms are quoting prices of $7.50 to $8.50, and there are many such offers. The large price differences are due to the difference between newly arrived and old stock. New goods have a 20% increase in taxes, which raises the cost by 20%. Older stocks, due to their poor color, are often sold at a discount, but some in the industry have also raised prices on old stock. Most of the goods needed by Sichuan merchants are priced around $7, with the highest price being no more than $8. It is reported that over 700 yards have been traded yesterday.</p>

<p>The tinplate market has been very active recently. Merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other regions have all made additional purchases, and local can factories are also making spot purchases. Due to the large number of arrivals, prices have not yet increased. Currently, 90-pound British tinplate is estimated at $17, American tinplate is offered at $19.80, and spot prices can be as high as $20. 180-pound British tinplate is offered at $33.50, American tinplate at $40. Recently, Italian tinplate has arrived in Shanghai, and its estimated price is $33, which is cheaper than British and American tinplate. Therefore, it is welcomed by general users, and it is likely to gain a foothold in the goods market.</p>

However, spot tin prices have soared recently, so tinplate prices may continue to rise.</p>
<p>Tobacco tinplate sales have gradually increased among merchants, and transactions among local factories have also seen a resurgence. However, inventories are low, leading to a shortage of goods in the market, and standard prices are rising. Currently, 2.6 x 6 feet, 18-sheet prime tinplate is quoted at $13.40 per picul, and sub-grade tinplate is quoted at $12. 3.6 x 3 feet, 3-sheet to 10-sheet is quoted at $10.08, an increase of $0.10-$0.20 compared to the previous period. It is estimated that a total of 600-700 piculs were offered on the market yesterday, but there were not many spot goods. Industry members have ordered futures from foreign firms, totaling over 100 tons, with prices for 2.6 x 6 feet, 18-sheet prime tinplate at £11 12s 6d per ton, sub-grade at £10 5s, and 3.6 x 3 feet, 3-sheet to 10-sheet at £9 10s per ton.

<p>— Hua Suo</p>
<p>A person skilled in governing the country and bringing peace to the world can truly see methods for doing so everywhere. In Sichuan, some people believe that long gowns waste cloth and send teams to cut them off; in Shanghai, a public figure wants to regulate teahouses. It is said that there will be three main points of regulation: first, attention to hygiene; second, setting time limits; and third, implementing education.</p>
<p>The first point is certainly good. The second point, where going to a teahouse and hearing a bell like in school is a bit of a hassle, but for the sake of drinking tea, there's no way around it and it's not too bad.</p>
<p>The most difficult is the third point. The 'ignorant masses' come to teahouses not only to hear news and chat, but also to listen to stories like 'The Case of Judge Bao'. The era is long past, and the truth is hard to know, so they listen to nonsense and stay there. If it is changed to 'The Case of Official So-and-So', people might not believe it or want to listen. If you only talk about the secret histories and dark sides of the enemy, what one side calls the enemy might not be the enemy of those listening. So they might not want to listen too earnestly. The result would be that the teahouse owner suffers and business becomes slow.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, there was an opera troupe in my hometown called 'The Gathering Jade Troupe'. However, the name did not match the reality, and the opera was so bad that no one wanted to watch it. The townsfolk, no less skilled than the great writers, wrote a song for them:</p>
<p>'On stage, the Gathering Jade Troupe,</p>
<p>Below, everyone scatters.</p>
<p>They hastily close the temple door,</p>
<p>Both sides of the wall collapse (flat tone).</p>
<p>They hastily try to hold it up,</p>
<p>Leaving only a noodle vendor.'</p>
<p>The choices of the audience cannot be forced. If they don't want to watch, there is no use in dragging them. Similarly, there are some publications with money and power that could be popular throughout the world. However, not only is the audience limited, but even submissions are few and far between, so they can only publish every two months. Satire is the old man's dream talk of the previous century, and good non-satirical literature seems to be the product of the youth of the next century.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Prostitution Ban <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Ju Ren</p>
<p>The issue of whether or not to lift the prostitution ban in Nanjing has been discussed by the Executive Yuan, which shows the importance of the issue. The stated reason for lifting the ban is to alleviate the sluggishness of the market, i.e., to use brothels to boost the economy. The reasons against lifting the ban are mostly focused on morals and ethics, and also mention the dignity of women, etc. It is very difficult to resolve this issue where morality and prosperity cannot be reconciled.</p>
<p>Before the prostitution ban issue is resolved, I would not dare to participate in the discussion. However, after reading the sages' books for many years, I have never known that lifting the prostitution ban would boost the economy, or that not lifting it would maintain morality. The relationship is so significant that I am truly ignorant! However, what I am reminded of is that there was a professor in Beijing who was keen to study social problems. He specially asked a friend to introduce him to a prostitute for an open and honest conversation. The professor asked her, 'Would you like me to help you get out of this?' The professor expected her response to be, if not grateful, at least willing. Who knew that the prostitute would give a negative answer. The prostitute asked the professor, 'If you help me out, what will I do? What can I do? I have an elderly mother and father, three younger brothers, and a younger sister. What will happen to this family?' The professor was speechless and could not answer. (See the Social Problems Biweekly of the Dagong Daily for details.) According to the prostitute's eloquent argument, whether prostitution is banned or not has nothing to do with the prosperity or decline of the market, or the maintenance or loss of morality. She has to eat, her family has to eat, so she has to sell her body. Even a university professor who studies social problems has nothing to say. As the German Karl Kautsky said, 'Capitalists not only take advantage of their inexperience to give them wages that are too low to cover their own expenses, but also imply, or even explicitly say, that prostitution is the only way to supplement their income. Under the capitalist system, prostitution has become a pillar of society.' These words hit the nail on the head.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Stone Statues <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>In the suburbs, among the weeds and rubble, I saw several pairs of imposing stone statues standing tall.</p>
<p>Holding court tablets in their hands and wearing swords at their waists,</p>
<p>each faced the other with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>Months, two months, countless months passed. Years, decades, hundreds of years passed. They battled the storms and raging winds, the thick frost and scorching sun. They endured the chopping of woodcutters and the grazing of shepherds, the nesting of orioles, swallows, crows, and sparrows. They always stood coldly among the weeds and rubble with solemn faces, indifferent to gain and loss, life and death, devoid of love, hatred, bitterness, and joy.</p>
<p>I felt melancholic.</p>
<p>The morning sun shone silently upon their heads.</p>
<p>I turned and moved forward. A red wall was in sight, the front gate of the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.</p>
<p>I entered with a sense of reverence. Flowers and trees lined the path, casting shadows. I passed through the memorial hall and arrived at the tomb. In the arched tunnel, I climbed the steps.</p>
<p>On the circular earthen mound, dense old trees grew lushly. The Ming tomb unfolded before my eyes. Serene, ancient, majestic, solemn...</p>
<p>I recalled Zhu Yuanzhang's revolutionary achievements, and I also lamented the surrender of the peasant leader.</p>
<p>On the sandy soil without industrial revolution, the feudal construction of history suppressed the rebellious hearts of all traitors.</p>
<p>I vaguely saw that peasant leader with a resolute will and a face covered in soil, who had seized power with the strength of a sickle. However, he had turned around and discarded the sickle, using the feudal pen to consolidate his own power.</p>
<p>I walked out of the Xiaoling Mausoleum with a sense of despondency. I repeatedly saw those pairs of stone statues, standing coldly among the weeds and rubble.</p>
<p>The morning sun had kissed their entire bodies.</p>
<p>Equipped with the attire and demeanor of scholar-officials, they were like living people in every way. Yet, they had to remain the same for thousands of years, clasping their hands, straightening their waists, and standing tall with solemn faces, indifferent to life and death, gain and loss, devoid of love, hatred, bitterness, and joy, to decorate the... to decorate the majesty of that 'feudal construction'!</p>
<p>I felt melancholic.</p>
<p>Under the morning sun, I walked past those pairs of stone statues, and when my own thin shadow was submerged in their inverted images, I felt a suffocating, melancholic feeling for the similarity of our fates.</p>
<h3 id="e271">On the Use of Gongs and Drums in Old Opera <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw asked Dr. Mei Lanfang, 'Why does Chinese opera need to use gongs and drums?' Dr. Mei replied, 'Some Kunqu operas do not use gongs and drums.' Although this is a quick answer, it is still somewhat evasive. Mr. Ye Gongchuo asked Shaw, 'Why don't you eat meat?' Shaw said, 'I don't eat meat because I don't eat meat.' Dr. Mei should have answered Shaw, 'Chinese opera needs gongs and drums because Chinese opera needs gongs and drums.' Responding with humor is a matter of etiquette, and wouldn't this further demonstrate that China is a land of ritual and should not be underestimated? Shaw has no respect for China, and I can retort with 'Don't say Qin has no men!' Previously, I saw Mr. Ju Ren's article on gongs and drums in Free Talk, which sparked my thoughts and I intended to elaborate, but I was unable to do so due to being confined to bed by illness. Now Dr. Mei has come to Shanghai again to perform his skills, and the sound of gongs and drums fills the ears, how can I remain silent?</p>
<p>I believe that as long as there is Chinese opera, it cannot be separated from gongs and drums, whether it is considered a national dross or a national treasure depends on individual wisdom and opinion. The Huabu Luan Tan operas certainly cannot avoid the noise of gongs and drums. Even Kunqu opera values gongs and drums. In the early Qing Dynasty, Li Yu had already spoken of avoiding excessive gongs and drums. He believed that the gongs and drums in the opera were related to the tendons and joints. Striking when one should not, not striking when one should, emphasizing when one should be light, and lightening when one should be heavy, all detract from the value of the opera. There is great truth in this, which only those who are experienced in opera know. The worst thing is to suddenly interrupt at a crucial moment, such as when the spoken dialogue is not finished, or when the melody is just beginning, with indiscriminate striking that covers the sound, causing the listener to miss a few sentences and fail to understand the connection between events, or causing the auditor not to hear the starting note and not know what song will be sung later. Interrupting the song is forgivable, but obscuring the dialogue is inexcusable. There is also the case where an opera is about to end, with only a few lines of dialogue left, and these few lines are the key, but the gongs and drums of the opera house are already urging the end, making the saying or not saying the same, which is regrettable. Therefore, the speed and emphasis must be carefully considered. If those on stage will not speak, then the blame cannot be placed solely on the actor, but the gongs and drums are equally at fault. Li Yu's argument was made during the decline of Kunqu opera, and no one paid attention at the time. When Luan Tan arose, the gongs and drums became even more disordered, and this was considered necessary to make the scene lively, which is why Luan Tan is called Luan Tan. The so-called Luan Tan now takes Erhuang as the orthodox style. The instruments used in Erhuang, such as large gongs, small gongs, small cymbals, large drums, large cymbals, small cymbals, and clappers, can only produce irregular noise. They either add to the liveliness of the scene, determine the beginning and end of the recitation, express the tension and relaxation of emotions, or indicate the speed of actions. The function of gongs and drums is such, but its musical significance is not worth mentioning. The way of striking gongs and drums, apart from the "paizi" tunes, can be divided into about twenty kinds. The "shui long yin" and "jiang jun ling" among the "paizi" tunes seem to be a kind of harmony organization, but in fact they are only used to control the rhythm and enhance the momentum. In the Erhuang of the past twenty years, the louder the gongs and drums, the better. In martial arts operas, they do not hesitate to break the large gong to enhance the prestige of the characters. Mr. Ouyang Yuqian said that the ears of such drummers are more developed than ordinary people, and some even become deaf in old age. Although this sounds like a joke, it is actually the case.</p>
<p>In short, I believe that the distant origins of Chinese opera come from wrestling. The wrestling performances of the Qin, Han, Sui, and Tang Dynasties were also called San Yue, which can be found in the chronicles and musical annals. Martial arts require gongs and drums to indicate advance and retreat and to strengthen the array, and music cannot do without metal and leather instruments. Is this why old Chinese opera does not abandon martial arts and gongs and drums? I wonder what Dr. Mei thinks.</p>

<p>Carrot Whiskers, who had already walked away, turned around when he heard these words and took a few steps behind his mother. Finally, he suddenly rushed in front of his mother, blocked the way, and silently presented his face.</p>
<p>The Lepic's (raising his right hand to strike down)! I know you lie, but I didn't expect you to be so cunning. Now, you've told two lies. If this continues, you'll start by stealing an egg, then steal a cow, and then you'll murder his mother. (The first slap landed)</p>
<p>Personal Thoughts</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic, elder brother Felix, elder sister Elestine, and Carrot Whiskers were chatting in front of the fireplace after dinner. A tree root was burning in the fireplace, and all four chairs were rocking on their front two legs. Everyone was arguing, and Carrot Whiskers was expressing his personal thoughts when the Lepic's weren't around.</p>
<p>'In my opinion,' he said, 'family titles mean nothing. For example, Dad, you know how much I love you! But I love you not because you are my father, but because you are my friend. In fact, you have done nothing to deserve being my father, but I consider your friendship towards me a high favor, a favor you could have chosen not to give me, but you generously gave it to me.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' Lepic replied.</p>
<p>'What about me? What about me?' elder brother Felix and elder sister Elestine asked together.</p>
<p>'It's the same,' Carrot Whiskers said. 'Fate made you my brother and sister. Why should I thank you for that? If the three of us had not been born into the Lepic family, who is to blame? You were powerless to prevent this from happening. I don't need to feel happy about this kind of familial relationship that doesn't come from the heart. All I need to thank you for is that, brother, you protect me, and sister, you give me useful care.'</p>
<p>'It's our duty to serve you,' elder brother Felix said.</p>
<p>'Why does he have to think of such ideas?' elder sister Elestine said.</p>
<p>'And what I've said, I can summarize and affirm. I'm not referring to anyone in particular, and even if Mom were here, I would repeat it to her face.'</p>
<p>'You wouldn't repeat it twice,' elder brother Felix said.</p>
<p>'What's wrong with what I said?' Carrot Whiskers replied. 'Please don't change my mind! I'm not only not a heartless person, but the love I have for you is even deeper than what's on the surface. But this kind of love is not mundane, instinctive, habitual, but intentional, rational, and logical. Logical, yes, that's the word I'm looking for.'</p>
<p>'When are you going to break this habit?!! This habit of liking to use words that you don't even understand yourself and then trying to teach them to others before they're even dry behind the ears,' Lepic said, as he stood up to go to bed. 'If your grandfather were alive, he would have given me a kick or a slap the moment he heard a quarter of what you said, to prove that I was still his child.' (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e273">Farewell to a Giant Turtle <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, though my mouth itched, I kept silent for quite some time because a dog-skin plaster was stuck on it, making it inconvenient to speak. Yesterday, while leafing through a certain newspaper, I thought that national affairs were beyond the comprehension of us children, and I was too lazy to worry about them. So, I diligently read news items like "Human Desires Run Rampant: Thirteen or Fourteen-Year-Old Boys and Girls Truly Ensnared," "Robbery of 128,000 Yuan in Cash," and "Red Pills," "Poisons," etc., one by one with great interest. Finally, I stumbled upon something strange and wonderful, so wonderful that it made my stomach hurt from laughing!</p>
<p>This incident happened in Changshu. The newspaper reported it as follows:</p>
<p>A fisherman caught a giant turtle "with a head the size of a bamboo dustpan, feet like wings without claws, and dozens of white plum-like spots on its back, measuring seven feet long and weighing hundreds of pounds." He transported it into the city for exhibition in the park. When this was known to benevolent people, they all considered the turtle to possess spiritual power and advocated for its release. Therefore, they collected 350 yuan to buy it from the fisherman. Yesterday, these great benefactors, along with the abbot of a certain temple, escorted the turtle with firecrackers and military music from the park to outside the Great Eastern Gate, where it boarded a pre-arranged gasoline boat to be released directly into the Hu River...</p>
<p>Reading this, I was greatly surprised. What surprised me was that "such a large turtle could actually exist in this world, and that such a large turtle was worthy of being seen off with 'firecrackers and military music' by the so-called benefactors." However, regarding the "farewell," in today's world where we are accustomed to "farewells," this is not surprising, let alone a farewell to a giant turtle, a spiritually powerful turtle.</p>
<p>As for what I call strange and wonderful, so wonderful that it makes my stomach hurt from laughing, and worth writing about in detail, it's all here:</p>
<p>...The boat had two armed guards with box cannons fore and aft for protection. (Xiao Zhi thinks this was probably to prevent kidnapping or assassination?) When passing Meili, tens of thousands of people crowded the shore, eager to see what was happening. (Xiao Zhi asks, was the scene more grand than the Human Sea that gathered at Taihe Hall in Beijing last October 21 to see the Panchen Lama's Dharma image for the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly?)… The only "Zhenyu" warship stationed in the Hu River, which protected the people from bandits in Changshu, had already lit its fires and was waiting to depart. All the officers and men of the warship stood at attention. Upon seeing the gasoline boat with the turtle, they immediately carried the turtle onto the warship. The escorting party also boarded the warship, and the warship immediately sailed at full speed to a point thirty li outside the river mouth. The police officers then carried the turtle down into the water. At that time, the abbot led the party in chanting release mantras, (Xiao Zhi shouts Amitabha Buddha, Namo Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva,) kneeling and respectfully sending it off. The ceremony was extremely grand. (Xiao Zhi says, it should be so, otherwise, if the giant turtle got angry or caused trouble, wouldn't the common people suffer?) After the turtle had left, the warship began to return, and the escorting party also took the original boat back to the city. (Hard work, escorting party!)</p>
<p>Xiao Zhi's required calculation is that in this event, besides the giant turtle being free to be reborn and gloriously return to its watery home, and a certain fisherman getting 350 yuan to go home and have a feast, (1) the people of Changshu were exhausted, (2) the police were sweating profusely (the police were the great heroes who released the turtle into the water), (3) a certain amount of firecrackers were set off, a certain amount of gasoline and "ship coal" were burned, in addition to armed guards, military music, chanting, kneeling...</p>
<p>Xiao Zhi then laughed and cried, from pain to sorrow.</p>

<p>— Jin Zhi</p>
<p>Leaning on the tower, composing poems to the wind and moon, what do national affairs have to do with strategizing? How many people can sit in command like Ma Sui?</p>
<p>Petitioning for justice echoes Han Xiu's memorials. Looking up at Wu and Gui, I reminisce about the past; turning back to Hangzhou, I regret former travels. The surging waters of the Pu River flow westward, as a student, I harbor Jia Yi's worries. Living in the countryside, it's difficult to avoid becoming a recluse; today, I remain in the aftermath of chaos. Is it possible to relight the Ge Hong's furnace? How many Fan Li's pots remain from half a lifetime? Flying ducks can still be seen after a thousand years, while taming cranes once spread a feather and are lost. The vicissitudes of the world increase my emotions, and I still discuss pacifying the people with the Tianbao era as an example.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Lingering Echoes <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>Let's not talk about national affairs; let me talk about romance. "Romance"? The weather is right in the middle of the plum rain season, and the wind makes people feel unhappy; the moon? The moon is also at the end of its period, although after ten o'clock it may emerge from the clouds, pitiable... On a night with no wind and no moonlight, I just sit quietly in my room. In the deep silence, I suddenly hear the lingering echoes of Bai Yunpeng and Xiao Hei Guniang's drums.</p>
<p>I only saw Bai Yunpeng and Xiao Hei Guniang a few days before they left. That night, I was feeling very bored, so I decided to take a stroll in the Beiping book market. Although I don't understand drums very well, I can appreciate the leisurely charm of them. It was still early when I got to the book market, and there were other people singing. Through the singing of these people, I gained a better understanding of the true essence of drums. Later, Xiao Hei Guniang came out gracefully from behind the curtain amidst the cheers of the audience. She was truly a beautiful girl. In the midst of the flowers and lights on the stage, she looked even more charming. These flowers were all gifts from affectionate young gentlemen, as a farewell souvenir. I remember that night, there were two comedians interspersing their performance by saying:</p>
<p>"Who are you going to give these flowers to?" "These are all for our Xiao Hei Guniang." "Why are you giving her flowers?" "This is a sign of affection from the young masters who are in love with the girl. Later, these flowers may be returned to them." "Why is that?" "Because when the young masters think of the girl after she leaves, they can smell them, and it will be like seeing the girl." I found this very interesting.</p>
<p>Xiao Hei Guniang sang "The Great Western Chamber" that day, and she sang it with great ups and downs. When she sang the line "Lonely, lonely, cold, clear, empty, laborious, desolate, cool...", it was like the galloping of rain in an empty mountain. But when she sang "Lowering her head, silent, speechless, her waist is thin...", it was like the pauses and breaks in the secluded warbling of an oriole. But in the second half, the cheers grew louder and louder, but her voice was drowned out. Soon, Xiao Hei Guniang went inside. I drank a cup of tea and waited for Bai Yunpeng. I imagined that this northerner must be a burly man, but to my surprise, a refined scholar with an elegant demeanor came out, which was really beyond my expectations! He was probably over fifty years old, and he spoke very fluent Beipinghua, and every word was very clear. He had rich emotions, and he had a humble attitude. Because that night was the last day, he said a lot of things: "...Goodbye, everyone, finally goodbye. We, these humble and insignificant trifles, are very grateful and ashamed to have gained your appreciation. Although we have put a lot of effort into our art, we are still just wandering beggars..." How tactful and emotional these words are. He was singing "Daiyu Burning Manuscripts." He said, "...These days, I have been singing the Dream of the Red Chamber. The Dream of the Red Chamber is naturally a very good material, but it has made me suffer. Every day I sing a section, I always have to cry for a while!..." Listen, how poetic these words are! His singing was most satisfying to me. Quick and slow, every word conveyed the spirit. When he sang quickly, it was like a shower; when he sang softly, it was like weeping. In particular, the section "...Her slender willow waist can't be held in one hand, her apricot face is yellowed from illness, her oriole voice is hoarse from constant coughing, her delicate breath can't stop her pink nose from flaring..." was especially moving to me; when he sang "...Who is like me, lonely and bitter, even more sad...", his eyes were moist. This was a very deep impression for me.</p>
<p>Bai Yunpeng's art is worthy of praise. He gave me a deep impression. But they left. Every time I rest after work, I miss this artist. I can only 空地 appreciate 腦 的 的 lingering echoes.</p>

<p>— Huan Yi</p>
<p>The weekly dinner party; this is already the fourth time. Judging from the past three times, it has generally been smooth. However, although it is limited to one small cup of wine per person, at the end of each dinner, there are always one or two people whose faces are as red as a rising fire, at least somewhat unsteady. But, clearly, this is not drunkenness.</p>
<p>Around a lavish twelve-dollar feast, ten foodies were gathered, men and women mixed together, of course, with no distinction between guests and hosts. Each person was full of energy, displaying their daily practiced skills. Dishes came up, orders were given, and chopsticks rained down on the same plate, until the bottom of the plate was completely exposed.</p>
<p>Aimless small talk, from all over the country to all over the world, but trying to find the beginning of the first sentence is often impossible to trace. We don't know what we started talking about, but we talked about prostitutes and dancers.</p>
<p>"Prostitutes and dancers, they all willingly fell." So, Mrs. Li expressed some opinions on them. "A person, given two hands by nature, can do anything. Why must they do such a base thing?"</p>
<p>"That's right! They..." Miss Wang echoed her with sympathy.</p>
<p>"However, it's not just the woman's fault." Mrs. Li suddenly changed the subject, seemingly showing some forgiveness towards prostitutes and dancers. "If there were no men to mess around, how could they gain a foothold? So, it's still the men's fault." Of course, Mrs. Li was not shooting without a target.</p>
<p>Mr. Li silently ate his melon seeds.</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true! It's also because life forces them to be like this." Da Ge probably saw Mr. Li's cramped and uneasy attitude, which was too embarrassing, so he was the first to raise an objection. But he was, after all, a kind and honest elder, so his words were always relatively peaceful. But the debate started at this time.</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Lin... They are oppressed by life, which is pitiful, so please take care of them!" You don't have to hear what Xiao Zhang said, you can know his personality just by seeing his face. Especially today, in front of Miss Wang, he naturally stood on her side of the battle line and particularly showed his sharp skills. Then there was a cold laugh that didn't move his face or flesh.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li and Miss Wang laughed triumphantly, and everyone laughed. Da Ge was a little embarrassed, and he pretended to be calm, aiming at the plate and eating the dish. At this time, suddenly, a new force rushed out from my side and joined the opposition with determination, saying...</p>
<p>"Everyone must know... this issue... is not just a matter of a few people, nor is it solely the responsibility of men. Who should be responsible for some of it? In other words, an attack by an environment in life cannot be resisted by an individual; the entire society should be responsible for it." Mr. Ye's face was completely red, and in his neck, there was a green vein as thick as a finger. Finally, he muttered to himself... "Who doesn't want to eat a twelve-dollar feast?"</p>
<p>At that time, there were obviously two opposing factions. The remaining four people also joined the battle line based on their own positions. As a result, in a not-so-large room, the air suddenly became tense, and a round table with messy dishes was used as the battlefield for a great debate.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a worker, so my knowledge is lacking. When I encounter problems, I always have difficulties. Now I have encountered a problem again. Please take some time to instruct me, and I will never forget your kindness.</p>
<p>I have a friend who used to be an apprentice in a cigarette paper shop not far from my home, so I knew him. Later, he became a trainee at a certain hospital. As for me, I still do this work like a horse in a factory. After the "January 28th" incident last year, I lost my job. Later, he helped me find a job as a trainee at a certain pharmacy, but it required 100 yuan for room and board, and it took a year to graduate. Later, I realized that this pharmacy was cunning, recruiting trainees as a trick to earn 100 yuan. Therefore, I did not fall into this trap. But my friend, he looked down on me for it, saying that I had no aspirations and was taking a path of decline. Later, I found a job in another factory. This was last year. Recently, I ran into that friend again. He still said in that tone that working in a factory will never allow you to turn over. I was really pissed off by his words. Later, I thought to myself that his words were not wrong. I am determined to work hard and make progress in this industrial field. Our industry is lacquer manufacturing. Although I can't talk about academic qualifications in this industry now, I do have some achievements in practical experience. However, even with achievements, you must have knowledge and assets to control them. Therefore, my success in this industry is like waiting for a day with no sun. I want to improve my knowledge, but my monthly income is only 13 yuan. Food, clothing, and shelter are all paid for here, and if I am sick and take leave, my salary will be deducted. Therefore, it is very difficult to satisfy my desire for knowledge. I don't know if there are any free schools anywhere. If there are any kind-hearted gentlemen who can lead me out of this situation, that would be a great favor to me. I want to ask, is there any hope for me to satisfy my desire for knowledge in this way in the future? Finally, my father often asks me for money. It's not that I'm unwilling, but the truth is that I don't have any extra money to give to my father! Please also help me think of a way! Wishing you</p>
<p>Well-being, Shen Xiaoqin</p>
<p>XXXX Editor's Note: Society is supported by the joint efforts of all parties, so if a person, in addition to sitting and eating, can do commensurate work to offset his consumption, then there is no distinction between noble and lowly: being an official and being a "beggar," both are serving the community. Understanding this principle, we can achieve the level of "constancy" and not be fickle, which leads to no results. Your friend's words, although spoken out of enthusiasm, are inevitably somewhat prejudiced against laborers: it is best to explain your position to him tactfully, otherwise, "thank you for your concern" will also do. It is right for you to be determined to make progress in the industrial field; as for the duties in the pharmacy, because it is not something you are familiar with, even if it is not cunning, there is nothing to regret.</p>
<p>As for completely free supplementary schools that suit you, we have not heard of any; this is entirely because they also have their own expenses. However, there are many places in Shanghai that charge very low fees and can reduce them for the poor. You can ask the supplementary schools near your residence to reduce the fees. Unfortunately, the several amateur supplementary schools currently run by this newspaper are too far from your place; if you don't mind being a little further away, or if we add new ones in the future, we can make special arrangements.</p>
<p>Between father and son, there is a matter of nature; if you are very embarrassed, just be sincere with him, and perhaps he will not want to make things difficult for you. But if his difficulties are far greater than yours, then you should also give a little bit. In short, it should depend on your ability and his needs, and be open and honest.</p>

<p>After a while, Shi Qiao walked back from the east again, unexpectedly and boldly grabbed her hand, and then went upstairs to his room without saying anything.</p>
<p>Meizi followed him into his room involuntarily, and couldn't find the right words, so she asked, "What are you doing back here? Don't you look very busy?"</p>
<p>"We are going to fight with you too, do you know? I came back to write a plan for how we will organize student volunteers, and they will go and make connections separately!"</p>
<p>"What? You are going to fight with us? Aren't we good friends who have been together for a long time, and aren't we still living together?"</p>
<p>Shi Qiao smiled and couldn't answer. From Meizi's question, it became clear that the so-called national hatred was not among the general populace, and that the Japanese imperialist invasion of China was not for the populace. How disconnected this was from Meizi! The enemies Shi Qiao was going to fight were certainly not Meizi's, but Meizi's "them"!</p>
<p>After this very natural question, Meizi was inexplicably touched by the sadness of her floating existence. Her eyelids drooped, and her hands lightly twisted her clothing buttons. Li Shi Qiao knew that he had misspoke, and always wanted to say a few words to comfort her, but the more anxious he was, the less he could find the right gentle words, just staring at her blankly: looking at this foreign, fallen girl, with her plain clothes! She never wears Japanese clothes! Combined with her thin and slender figure, the cold feeling was like a Western nun; that "beauty" moves people with the light of a spiritual soul. Shi Qiao initially stretched out his hands, making a posture of almost wanting to hug her, but then retracted his hands! It is not okay to hug a married woman, and it is not okay to bully a pitiful woman; but that hand twisting the clothing button hooked his arm, and that body came even closer, and her powerless head leaned on his shoulder, and gentle words slowly leaked from her pale lips;</p>
<p>"Are you really going to fight? Mr. Li!" Pausing, "War, war, why is there war?"</p>

<h3 id="e279">Before Greta Garbo Returned to Hollywood <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Nan</p>
<p>Where can one entrust the sorrow of parting? The scenery of the old palace still lingers for a few days. Greta Garbo has already returned to Hollywood. After so much confusion, the enigma has finally been broken. On March 24th, she boarded a ship very secretly and quietly left Gothenburg, Sweden. After five weeks at sea, she safely arrived at San Diego, California, USA, on April 30th. An American film magazine, ScreenBook, recorded her activities in great detail. The following are some of Greta Garbo's deeds before leaving Sweden, because this small chronicle can reveal some poignant emotions in the midst of extreme ordinariness, so it has been translated.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo bid farewell to the capital of Sweden. She and her friend Max Gumpel drove around the streets in his Duesenberg car for a week. Gumpel is an engineer whom Garbo knew before she went to Hollywood. This time Garbo returned to her hometown, and Gumpel was her companion, accompanying her in tennis, swimming, and dancing. Because of his advocacy, she invested a considerable amount of capital in real estate in Stockholm, and she has bought at least two houses. She and he toured all over Stockholm, lingering and reluctant to leave, probably because the grass and trees of her hometown would surely haunt her dreams after she left. A week before she left Stockholm, Garbo and her old friends Count Gösta Ekman and Countess Ekman went to see the premiere of the film "Grand Hotel." Because it was a film starring her, she was persuaded to appear in front of the screen.</p>
<p>On March 14th, news spread that Miss Garbo had booked a cabin on the ship Gripsholm, scheduled to set sail on April 1st. So, the general reporters were very busy preparing. But Garbo was also too mischievous, because April 1st is April Fool's Day, so the reporters only understood after being fooled.</p>
<p>On March 21st, Ms. Garbo left her residence at 7 Dottninggatan and made a final visit to her mother and brothers, and then went to a別 with each one individually. It was not until that evening that she was found in Tyersö, which is Count Wrangel's villa and also Garbo's paradise for escaping people. That crack is about fifty miles away from Stockholm and is a place with secluded scenery. This villa was originally a palace built in 1630, but at the end of the 17th century, it fell into the hands of the Wrangel family. On the 22nd and 23rd, Garbo wandered and lingered in this place, quietly entrusting her sorrow of parting to various places. Sometimes she rode with Jonniella Wrangel, the daughter of Wrangel, and went out to play, without any sign of saying goodbye to her hometown. But on Friday, the 24th, the Wrangel couple left Tyersö for Gothenburg. They boarded the ship, with an unknown person in between. The ship was named Annie Johnson, and the strange guest was named Mr. John EmerSon. The captain specially built a swimming pool and other luxurious facilities for this strange guest. After the strange guest boarded the ship, the captain immediately summoned all the crew to meet and instructed them not to mention the name of this strange guest. But a nurse who heard that she was assigned to wait on this strange guest was so happy that she almost fainted!</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>New Style, Good Technique</p>
<p>丨A Miniature of Society in Turmoil丨</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a rare gem among European and American films. If we can objectively let go of excessive strictness or unrealistic expectations, we can acknowledge that this is the highest achievement possible within capitalist cinema. To go further in expression, only Soviet works dare to be so bold.</p>
<p>The film's plot centers on the emotional conflict between female students and their headmistress. Innocent and peaceful girls yearning for freedom, craving genuine love between people. However, the feudal</p>
<p>headmistress subjects them to militaristic education, forbidding all their freedom. This causes internal resentment among the students. Although usually subdued under oppressive forces, they are ultimately moved by collective sympathy, bordering on unrest. In the end, the headmistress realizes her management has failed and voluntarily resigns.</p>
<p>On the surface, the film's primary purpose seems to be opposing militaristic education. In reality, the clever filmmakers use the film as a microcosm of a society in turmoil, illustrating the conflict between the oppressors and the oppressed. The majority of people are starving for benevolence and peace, sacrificing for freedom, wanting to breathe and live in the air of freedom. Yet, the oppressors do not grant them the opportunity for freedom, offering at best only a limited scope of joy during occasions like "the headmistress's birthday, a school gathering to celebrate." It is evident that the oppressors, with their supreme authority, attempt to preserve</p>
<p>their rule forever, even resorting to driving people to their deaths. However, this opposition of "love and hate" will one day erupt in a total explosion, and to avoid this unfortunate destruction, the only way is to request that the rulers voluntarily relinquish their rule! This is the greatest concern of the film's author.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the most thorough solution for those standing in the position of the oppressor who fear hearing the cries of the oppressed. Because they understand the physical principle that "the higher the pressure, the higher the resistance," it is better to relinquish the position of oppressor rather than wait for a future explosion that cannot be controlled. But is it truly unnecessary for the water's resistance to make the cork come loose on its own? This, of course, is a non-physical fantasy. Furthermore, the headmistress leaving the school is merely to have a female teacher replace her with a more lenient and moderate management style. It's not as though the school will be run by the students themselves. Therefore, the film does not abandon its own position, but merely believes that this form is not very reasonable. Regarding the performance, it is not only novel because it is entirely female, but also because it has a clear new style. Not exaggerated, not old-fashioned, not dull, not nonsensical. On the contrary, it is authentic, vivid, calm, and compact. It completely abandons the old ways of typical European and American films, and strives to create a new tone. For example, the dance scene is not about extravagance but about the pressure of emotions. The female students' bathing scene is merely a sketch of school life, not a display of sensuality. There is humor, but not nonsense. The depiction of oppressive forces is thorough and detailed, especially the sound of the headmistress's leather shoes, truly a subtle and insightful portrayal. In short, for a female writer-turned-director to achieve such results in her directorial debut, Leontine Sagan, is truly admirable. However, the final scene where everyone shouts M2nuela (a student's name) to such a weak ending is somewhat regrettable.</p>
<p>As for the group of actors, they are all important and all willing to perform seriously, without exaggeration or laziness, which is also commendable. That crowd scenes can be so well done also shows the director's skillful technique. The female teacher's performance with tears welling up in her eyes is naturally a perfectly executed technique. However, due to limited space, other aspects will be omitted.</p>

<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>This empty script tells us the astonishing (?) story of a female street performer who falls in love with a wealthy young man. The wealthy young man, for her sake,</p>
<p>breaks off his engagement with his original fiancée, achieving the goal of marriage. The wealthy young man even joins the street performance troupe to perform.</p>
<p>But the film's performance! Is a thousand times more complex than what is written above. It unintentionally depicts the past history of the female street performer, even including the affairs of three generations of ancestors, taking up over a thousand feet of film. Although it is</p>
<p>reflecting their courage and indomitable spirit, it is ultimately a waste. Of course, there are also many legitimate narratives in the script, such as writing about the hardships of street performing life, the audience's unforgiving nature, and the world's emphasis on beauty over artistry. These are relatively realistic sketches that can evoke sympathy. However, these are fragmented and trivial, flaws outweighing the merits, making it difficult to give a good impression. There are also many extremely boring actions, such as the public invitation to perform at the end, which is certainly embarrassing for the parties involved, but is it ultimately an insult? And is it worth it to be motivated to go back to street performing because of this? In short, distorted consciousness abounds. With a better script intention, but unable to fully develop it, and adding disjointed and chaotic semi-new ideas, the entire script loses its focus. In particular, the film's grand finale, taking "going back to street performing" as the only bright path on the "Road to Physical Fitness," is even more puzzling! The great performance at the end promoting sports and enlightening the public is also not seen in the film! (It is in the explanatory pamphlet). The director is relatively good, but the script is too long, with many flashbacks and repetitions. Over ten thousand feet of film is simply not enough, so places where it could be developed are all omitted. The director used a lot of ingenuity in the small places, so the structure is very commendable. The cleverness of the scene divisions is indeed above "Peace Flower," with appropriate side descriptions and comparisons.</p>
<p>The cinematography can also be considered competent, diligently helping the director to complete the work. Although the forward and backward movements and transitions are inevitably stiff, the angles of the fixed position shots are well coordinated. The long shots and outdoor shots are relatively worse. The light is too weak, which is not very suitable for this "degenerate martial arts film," so it increases the "beauty" of the picture but reduces the "strength" of the film. The set design for the street performance venues is somewhat unrealistic, and the wealth and extravagance of the wealthy family seem excessive.</p>
<p>The sentences in the subtitles are both profound and as emotional as new poetry, so many people cannot understand them. Even if they do understand, they will feel that they are not related to the performance in the film.</p>
<p>Finally, it is time to talk about the performance. We already know that this film is "semi-martial arts," and street performances account for one-third of it. Adding that the film is so long, there is simply no opportunity to consider the development of the performance, it is just everyone playing a certain person and acting. However, I cannot help but say a few words about the main characters. The female street performer is Xu Qin Fang, who has always only known martial arts and not literature. Although she plays three roles (her grandmother and her mother), she only does fighting besides high jumping and tightrope walking. Her martial arts skills are not bad. Zheng Xiao Qiu plays the wealthy young man, with an excess of weakness and extravagance, and not enough steadfastness and depth. "He is a good son in the eyes of the old lady, but not a youth of the times," someone said, and it seems like a very fitting comment. His expression is only ordinary, and indeed, he is better in the first half as a handsome young man, but he seems very strained in the second half. Yan Gong Shang plays the wealthy old man, experienced and calm, fitting the identity of a conservative wealthy man. Xie Yun Qing, the head of the street performance troupe, is too literary, not like someone who travels the world, groaning and turning, sickly and fragmented, but very brilliant, indeed an actor with pure skill. Gao Yi An (wife of the wealthy man) and Xu Xin Yuan (the bully) are also only勉强 acting.</p>

<p>— Translated by Zi Gui</p>
<p>Rudolf and Barolomo rushed out, hailed a streetcar, and unceremoniously drove the conductor to the back car. Rudolf sat in the conductor's seat and drove the car himself. But when Rudolf got into the car, his greatcoat got caught on the car</p>
<p>door. Rudolf forcefully threw his greatcoat over his shoulder, revealing the shining white uniform inside. The two policemen standing at the door saw this, nodded knowingly, and blew their whistles. At this time, the car had shot out like an arrow. At Andenkrug's house, the doorbell suddenly rang continuously. Elena had already returned a few minutes ago, wearing a military greatcoat on the outside, and she didn't know where her own coat had gone. After she came back, she said goodnight to Anden and went back to her bedroom to sleep. Her complexion was very bad. Anden was thinking to himself at this time, had his plan been messed up, but the maid had already opened the door. Rudolf and Barolomo rushed in like madmen.</p>
<p>"Are you a doctor?" Rudolf asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Anden nodded. They looked at each other for a while, and Rudolf said...</p>
<p>"So you are the Doctor Professor. I really find it a bit strange. I always thought you were a long-bearded old man. Pleased to meet you." After he finished speaking, he bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Anden asked. Rudolf took a few steps back in surprise, and Barolomo quickly introduced him. Rudolf said he wanted to see Elena. Anden replied that she had already gone to sleep. Rudolf said it didn't matter, he could call her up. Anden looked at him, then sent someone to call Elena. At this time, Rudolf sent Barolomo away, and Anden said to Rudolf, "I very</p>
<p>like to see you."</p>
<p>"You like to see me?" Rudolf stammered a little.</p>
<p>"You probably can also imagine why I like to see you. You seem to have existed in our house for a long time, ever since the day I married Elena. Of course, I can tell you that this is not a welcome thing, but I have no way to drive you away, as if this house is occupied by you. Now when I see you, I think you are not such a terrible thing." "Oh," Rudolf said hesitantly, "I have met many women's husbands, but you are the first to tell me lies. I also like to meet you, you are truly a doctor worthy of the name." After he finished speaking, he ran over and stretched out his hand to shake Anden's. Elena was now upstairs looking down. Anden told her that they had become friends. Elena responded and came downstairs. Rudolf sat in a large chair and said comfortably... (To be continued)</p>
