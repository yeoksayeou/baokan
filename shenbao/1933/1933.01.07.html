<h3>日軍犯楡事件國聯又一試金石</h3>
<p>顏郭兩代表返抵日内瓦</p>
<p>將促國聯迅採有効處置</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國總代表顏惠慶及駐倫敦公使郭泰祺、今日已抵此間、故國聯方面對於滿洲事變之辯論、已有重開之準備、顏氏未到日内瓦之前、曾經南德與行政院院長汪精衛會談甚久、顏郭二氏抵此後、尙在靜待南京政府詳細訓令之中、故皆不願有所發表、僅謂楡關最近之事變、已足使中國更急促的要求國聯將中日爭端之全局迅速加以處置也、再則此次國聯討論滿洲事項、正在熱河方面砲聲隆隆之際、故恐慌亦愈甚、蓋此明明指示受審判者非中日兩國而爲國聯本身、因國聯本身應自受無拳無勇忝居國際法庭地位之處分也、至國聯方面所感覺者、亦屬愛莫能助、有詢國聯高級職員以滿洲事態者、僅稱「危險無定」等語、其餘則顯明表示日軍之行動、已使國聯處於進退維谷、無從自拯之地位云、據現狀觀之、國聯實已不能再向日本讓步、日本政府雖巧詞掩飾、而國聯方面勢須厲行其主張矣、外間復有一種謠言、謂日本或將早日脫離國聯云、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>我代表向國聯報告楡變眞相</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國際聯合會中國代表團、今日以南京政府關於山海關事變之正式電報、轉送國聯會秘書廳、内容如下、「據一月三日張學良電稱、曾接旅長何柱國一月二日自山海關來電、報告經過事實如次、一月一日於公開襲擊山海關以前、日本軍隊首先由其所部憲兵將日軍司令部大門自行炸毁、嗣復在附近一帶抛擲炸彈甚多、同時「滿洲國」警察一隊開槍數發、何旅長當派陳秘書前往日軍司令部、詢問肇事原因、日本方面答覆、謂彼亦未得確報、要求何旅長着手調查、日軍更要求山海關城内居民一律退出、避免發生不預期之危險、並限五十分鐘答覆、約半夜時、日本方面復提要求四項、㈠山海關南門、應由日本方面派兵巡邏、㈡中國方面撤退南門防軍、㈢中國方面撤退駐紮南門之憲警隊、㈣中國方面撤退山海關城牆一帶駐軍、以上要求限立時答覆、如答覆不能使日方滿意、則將向山海關城下總攻擊、日本方面更要求開放南門、並由日軍巡邏長城南面、此項要求均經何旅長堅决拒絶、日本軍隊乃集合進攻、在南門外之中國警察隊首被繳械、馬警察局長則被拘捕、在一月二日上午八點、日本火車三列步兵三千餘人、由鐵甲車一列加以保護、開抵山海關、約十時左右、遂開始攻擊、日本飛機向城中擲炸彈、我軍爲正當防衛起見、不得不還擊、雙方損失甚重、一月三日何柱國將軍又有一報告、略稱日本爲拖延時間、以待援軍開到起見、提議進行和平解决之談判、但日本援軍則絡繹而至、一月三日上午十點、開到滅魚艇二艘、山海關之南門受日本陸海空軍之攻擊、戰鬭極烈、日軍意欲攀登城牆、被我軍擊退、日方死傷甚衆、日軍不得逞、遂於上午十一時後退云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>顧代表函請國聯迅卽設法制日</h3>

<p>（日内瓦）國聯會中國代表顏惠慶博士、頃以下列文件送達國聯秘書長、請其轉遞國聯非常大會之十九國委員會、文稱、「鄙人頃接上海各重要公共機關來電、内開、日本軍隊現在熱河集中、國聯會對於中日爭案、尙未採取任何確定措置、此镒若再猶豫不决、則將來爲公允解决爭案所能擬定之計畫、恐將終無實效可言、敝會等有鑒於此、特向國聯會呼籲、請其立即採取切實辦法、俾時局不致再趨嚴重、商會聯合會·上海商會·上海銀行公會·上海錢業公會同叩等語、茲特送呈台閱」云云、秘書長徇顏惠慶之請、業將該項文件、轉遞十九國委員會、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日政府致國聯聲明書</h3>
<p>誣指我方首先挑釁</p>
<p>希圖淆亂世界視聽</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本關於楡案之聲明書、今日已由巴黎寄至此間、大旨如下、北平日當道曾勸張學良停止軍隊趨向「滿洲國」之調動、因知「滿洲國」之安全受危害也、但勸告無效、當此緊張不靖時機、楡關竟發生不愉快事件、緣華兵向楡關日憲兵站、抛擲炸彈、同時其他華兵亦向日憲兵隊長寓所、開槍射擊、而「滿洲國」邊防兵營中、亦有炸彈擲入、鑒於時局之吃緊性質、日當道遂立即向中國文武當局開始談判、以期和平解决此事、俾日軍營範圍内之日僑得獲安全、次日成立協定、規定由日兵巡邏南關區域、以保護日僑與鐵路、日兵一隊旋即派往南關、但華兵以來復槍與炸彈擊之、致斃日軍官二人、兵二人、至是日軍不得已開火還擊、而於一月三日午後二時許佔據楡關、統觀上述、楡關事變、由於華方挑釁、故意欲挫弱日本之國際地位、已可顯見、蓋以此事與華方侵入熱方之計畫有關、至於侵熱事件、前已提出責言矣、請將此文分致國聯各會員國、以免爲遠東傳來宣傳失實之情報所誤會云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會日本代表團對國聯會宣稱、山海關事件應認爲純粹局部問題、絶不致引起對中國本部之軍事行動、日本司令官已與何柱國將軍進行磋商、以便從速得一解决、日本代表團又云、楡城附近、現仍平靜、東京政府極欲避免因此事而致時局趨於嚴重、日本軍事當局、已按照此種意義、採取必要辦法、此次事變起於張學良將軍之陰謀、蓋南方各軍事長官均責張氏軟弱、故張氏採取反對「滿洲國」及日本之態度、藉以自重、由另一方面言之、張氏如此行動、乃對南京政府爲有益之合作、以引起國聯會之注意、日本代表團又謂、張學良最近爲侵入熱河省之廣汎計畫、「滿洲國」政府認爲有害於該地之和平秩序、並有害於「滿洲國」之安全、山海關事件發生之後、若能使張學良之計畫失敗、則「滿洲國」及日本至爲欣幸云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦日本代表辦事處秘書長澤田致電國聯秘書長德魯蒙、謂渠接日政府來電、聲明日本擬竭力將楡案作爲地方事件、除非華方挑釁、不作足以增重時局之任何行動、今已將必要之訓令電達當地日當局云、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>各國輿論一斑</h3>
<p>俄報一致抨擊</p>
<p>（莫斯科）自日軍進兵熱河之消息傳來、繼之以日軍佔據綏芬河之報告、蘇聯全境之報紙對於日軍閥之得動、一致抨擊、僅政府官報伊士末希亞報尙維持其歷來之鎭靜及熱望之態度、惟深切注意美國方面對此之反響、該報深覺日軍之繼續進攻、實足增加東京與華盛頓間形勢之緊張、但華盛頓方面之計畫尙不至立即變更、因華府方面固甚希望日本能即速克服其財政上之困難、而命令其軍人停止其軍事行動也、此實爲華盛頓方面惟一之方針、倘華盛頓採取任何他種方針、勢必致與英法雙方脫離關係云、伊士末希亞報末謂、即就此美國極力維護歐美間協調之方針而言、其中亦至多利害衝突之處、各帝國主義國家間之意見、亦與日俱深、故最後終不免一戰云、（四日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國守口如瓶</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國若干官吏雖聞東京所發種種否認與解釋、仍信日本今後行動、將向平津方面進發、若輩對於日軍進佔楡關、雖亦效國務卿史汀生之守口如瓶、不願加以正式評論、但今日已不復掩其焦急之狀、且據此間所聞、歐洲各國外部對於時局亦甚焦慮、據此間數官吏言、因日本未嘗說明其深入中國究將至何處爲止、其發言人在日内瓦所聲明者、適足以增加焦慮、其所稱日本無意擴張軍事行動至中國本部一語、不能視爲已切實說明其政策也、目下美官斱塲最畏慮者、深恐日本向平津出動時、北寗路沿線所駐外兵將被牽入漩渦、因若輩信日本早已决定佔據北平一帶、以絶滿洲義勇軍之接濟、惟若輩此種意見是否以華北美國軍事視察員所發消息爲根據、則皆不肯明言、現美國務院已明白表示對於山海關事件不發宣言、至其對於時局雖顯然與歐洲國家同樣焦急、但仍不肯公然承認、並聞美政府已訓令駐華美軍務須極端謹愼、切勿牽入任何糾葛云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國務院今日對楡關事件、仍默無表示、至史汀生與國務院僚屬及島務局員現仍繼續研究菲島獨立案、將於明日或星期一答呈意見、備總統於星期二加以准駁、（四日國民電）</p>
<h3>英報表示焦慮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）每日電聞今日社論、題爲國聯與日本、謂楡關戰事不獨可爲嘆息、且亦必增英國當局與政治界對於滿洲爭議結果之焦慮、如十九特委會因此戰爭而不復謀取辦法、以調和中日間對於滿洲前途之意見、則大可悲已、有人主張國聯對日採積極行動者、該報不以此態度爲然、謂日本如脫離國聯、則更不受拘束矣、而進窺北平之恫嚇、或將成爲事實、該報又謂日本爲遠東抵禦赤化之柱石、英國無論如何、不致與其舊盟友爲難云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國與論對於中日爭端、採取鮮明態度一事、不甚熱心、惟工黨機關報每日民聲報」載稱、「國聯會是否能完成其任務、當於本月中由滿洲與波斯二事件以證明之、即在歐洲方面、一般人已察知某種徵象、足見在若干時期以内、必至發生困難、歐洲和平實非穩固、以故歐洲大陸需要國聯會甚殷、藉以避免衝突之爆發、世人所以忽視亞洲事件者、以亞洲相隔遼遠、不足視重、實乃錯誤、此則信然、蓋因國聯會解决亞洲之爭端、如意失敗、則其在歐洲之行動、勢必因而减少力量矣」云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報顯然袒日</h3>
<p>（巴黎）巴黎時報對於遠東戰事新發展之評論、承認日本之主權、但同時對於日本軍事行動之效能與需要、表示懷疑、該報聲言、日本之所以進攻熱河、係因歐洲各國方在自顧不暇之中、俄國軍隊實力未充、中國則内亂頻仍、不能自拔、美國則在新舊政府靑黃不接之際、故深覺世界上無國家可以阻止其大陸野心之實現、故日本受此種誘惑、遂不顧一切、以期利用此千載一時之機會、但所可惜者、在現在國際變化情狀之下、原則與事實之間尙有大隔限云、（四日國民電）</p>
<h3>德報深切注意</h3>
<p>（柏林）柏林報紙現頗注意於遠東最近發展、社會黨機關前進報謂日本深入華北、掠奪式的新戰爭現已開始、伏錫志報謂鑒於已往事件及李頓報告書、日人之解釋、吾人必須以懷疑態度接受之、所可無疑者、東亞之政治戰爭、刻在發展中、而歐洲之政治定將受其深切之影響、波森報謂法國與捷克兵工廠現猶爲中日兩國製造軍械彈藥、台治斯報謂楡關事件乃中國及國聯之可怖的當頭棒擊、國聯將以混合的情感等候南京必有之抗議、想國聯與美國因此次最近之軍事行動而能明白了解日人祇知根據其必要利益而行事、絶不稍顧慮日内瓦之决議案也、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>時評山海關戰端已開　　㈠一月一日午後九時日本駐山海關憲兵分遺所。禀其素習挑衅之故技。向我駐軍區域投擲炸彈。并迫脅我楡關駐軍讓出楡城。不待我方答覆。即陸海軍并進。陸軍以鐵甲車附隨機關槍小鋼砲。四出衝擊。海軍就兵艦上開砲。轟擊楡關。我軍不得已起而應戰。日本乃故意使事件擴大。調動爆炸飛機八架。軍艦四艘。及弘前第八師團所屬之第四旅團。由旅團長鈴木美　少將統率其全旅團官兵五千餘人。進攻楡關。我軍奪起作戰。自二日晨至於五日激戰三日三夜。敵方傷亡。在五百以上。我軍第九旅石團。已與楡城共其存亡。爲東北事變以來第一次最光榮之爭鬭犧牲。第九旅且在城西佈置防禦工事與敵對抗。　　㈡戰端之啓。不過爲未來大戰之序幕耳。在日本方面。雖曾聲言「僅在　　楡關之管理。將以此次衝突爲地方事件。不使事態擴大。而就地方解决之」云云。吾人試以歷來日政府之公開聲明觀之。無不自食前言。背棄國際信義。東北三省爲我國領土。楡關熱河。皆爲華北之門户。豈能將　之責。付　强鄰之手。又豈能任敵人破門入室耶。　　矧日本軍閥自前年九一八事變以來。出其鐵蹄蹂躪我東三省地域。魚肉我人民。我爲維持和平起見。忍辱退讓。以迄於今。乃日閥肆其狡獪。謂其侵略政策之展開。係爲東亞和平。同時更借防抑赤俄以夦瞞世界列强。今試以陸相荒木直天所著新年獻詞。「萬事成就也」一文以證之。其中有言曰。「昭和八年癸酉之歲。乾坤一新。希望無限。均輝照於此時。而干支配合適在五月······酉之方位適在西。正指向大陸者也。且酉寓意於「萬事成就時也。」其於意義深遠。昭和八年之前途。閃爍象徵皇國飛躍之一靈兆······。」此種帶有神秘意味之詞句。誠不愧爲「皇國惟神之姿。」亦表現「神國日本」之特徵。然而此中神秘。固無須乎「神聖」始得而知之。即粗識日本者。亦能　見其肺肝。明悉彼帝國主義對外侵略對内夦瞞之故技。　　蓋日本旣已令武藤信義大將身兼關東軍司令官。關東州長官。及其所謂一滿洲（傀儡）國大使。集軍政外交於一身。換言之。即集中權力於日本軍閥之手。彼旣呑噬北滿。壓平蘇張。而散處各地之義勇軍。尙有十萬。使日本不能安然呑下滿洲。不過彼仍竭力「裝神弄鬼。」以爲從此太平無事矣。而在另一方面則盡力增加侵略東北軍備。於原有之第八師團。第十師團。第二十師團。及第二師團之一部。與夫各師團拙調之騎砲兵外。復於未年年底　態本第六師團以侵錦。而維南第十九師團。亦於本月一日下「待機」命令。準備入寇。其第八師團之前鋒。已與我軍挑鬭於臨楡前線。　　㈢是故楡關形勢。由緊急而危迫。由危迫而至於變爲瓦躒塲矣。我軍雖屢事退讓。自前年九一八迄今年餘。由瀋陽至於楡關。爲時不可謂不長。爲地不可不謂廣。其忍辱耐久之力。不可謂不大。而日本帝國主義者得寸進尺。貪得無厭。我若不能收復東北。彼且侵入華北矣。態本師團之增兵也。羅南師團之預備動員也。所謂充實在滿軍備之計劃也。等等切切。無不爲實現其大陸政策之手段。而大陸政策也者。侵略東北特其開端。侵略中國實爲其終極目的故彼方盡力製　口實。如石木權四卽案之類。以進襲熱河。侵占華北。然熱河地廣人稀。雖之山川形勢。守戰之備。而交通阻滯。險峻苦　。日軍無鐵路之便。有人事之厄。如單獨侵熱。設遇我軍之强力扺抗。勝負之戰。未可逆料。故乃　用其所長。借北寗路之便。復以海軍佐之。於是楡關形勢之利。　歸敵手。我軍乃處於極端困苦地位。陸軍縱可勉與週旋。而海空雙方受敵。楡關遂難於堅守。猶能奮力支撑。與强敵搏鬥三日。可見精力所至。亦足以使懦夫自立也。　　一二八迄今未及一年。而山海關熱河同時告警。雖日軍部尙謂不使事件據大。僅止於臨楡。但彼豺狼成性。决無信義可言。且此時已萬不可榆安。亦萬不能偷安。雖欲苟且求和。已不可得。故當前之計。惟有亟起自衛即使戰而敗。以中國之廣大。不愁無荷槍而起者。且敗猶可以再戰。『屢敗屢戰。』非往昔個人成功之激勵語耶。我國樍弱已甚。惰性已深。戰敗固在意中。然而戰敗之後。猶多再戰之機。與足供戰鬥之具。値此危難當前之際。惟有振作民族爭鬥精神。與敵人奮戰。以爭最後之生存。則終極勝利。必歸吾　無疑。美前總統柯立芝突逝世　　▲國民社五日諾桑浦敦（麻蕯諸塞州）電美國前總統柯立芝、今年在此間家内突發心臟猝中症逝世、迨下午一時十五分柯立芝夫人自外購物回家、則見其未在樓上臥室仆於地板、撫之已氣絶、其上掛與馬甲均脫去、顯正預備剃髭整容　　心病猝發不救　不料一刹那間、心病猝發、竟爾與世長辭、時其私人秘書羅斯猶在樓下、爲柯氏撰稿、並未聞樓上有何異聲、迨柯夫人發覺、立召醫生白朗�診察、則斷定其逝世約在半小時前、　　柯立芝氏　　全國同聲哀悼　迨噩耗旣傳全國　悼、弔唁之電即如雪片飛來、諾桑浦敦鎭立時　業、美京接訊、白宮立下半旗、並由總統府秘書通知兩院領袖、時參院正計論修改銀行法案、共和黨領袖華生即起請發表、遂登壇宣布噩耗、參院立爲之輟議休會、以誌哀悼、衆院接耗、並悉總統將有特别報告送院、遂延會以待、未幾總統報告送到、略謂美國前總統柯立芝忽於今日逝世、茲以噩耗奉告、良用怛悼、柯故總統功在國家、勛業爛然、倉卒之間、不遑縷述、諸君多與柯故總統共事甚久、諒皆深知其一生精力專爲國家、而又大有貢獻於人類福利者也云云、宣讀畢、衆院遂　會、總統亦遂正式發表柯氏噩耗、佈告全國、　　頃美總統下令爲故總統柯立芝服喪三十日、期内全國官署下半旗、海陸軍人佩喪帶、星期六全日各陸地駐所與旗艦、每隔半小時嗚禮炮、　　遺體舉行殯葬　柯氏靈機、現已定於明晨十時半在此間敎堂舉殯、禮節簡單、胡佛總統亦將來此送殯、禮畢立即運往普萊邁斯故鄕、安葬家園、即一九二三年八月三日上午二時三十分柯氏聞　定總統噩耗、即於煤油燈下就老父前宣誓就任總統之所、惟屆時胡佛總統恐或未必能送葬矣、　　讖語竟成事實　柯氏雖係猝薨、但事前一若有預知者然、昨日曾致函前總統府秘書克拉克、有「渠知工作已畢」語、並對於當選總統羅斯福表示同情、因有極嚴重問題、須羅氏應付也、惟令日則照常赴辦事之所、口授函稿數通、訪其舊日合辦律師事務之赫門偉、談笑自若、毫無異狀、迨回家午餐後、赴三層樓時、猶囑其秘書羅斯在下相待、柯氏慣於午間修面、今日大約在脫衣準備整容時猝雨仆地也、　　柯氏生前略歷　柯立芝名喀爾文、一八七二年七月四日誕於普萊邁斯、家本淸敎徒、父設小肆於鄕村、柯氏畢業於阿姆赫斯特事科大學後、即出爲律師、卜居諾桑浦敦、嗣歷任市議員州議員馬　諸塞州　州長與正州長、積二十一年經騐與政績、遂當選副總統、一九二三年哈定總統在任故世、柯氏方居普萊邁斯老父家内、中夜聞訊、即在老父前煤油燈下宣誓繼任、時論有護其不循向例在大　院法官前宣誓、視爲簡率者、柯氏則稱任何法官皆有監誓之權、而其父實爲普萊邁斯法官也、蓋淡泊率眞、寗靜寡言、乃柯氏之特性、在任六年、如訂立非戰公約·戰債協定·公斷智利與秘書兩國泰那阿利加爭執·樹立减縮軍備政策·開始政府大建築計劃、皆　　大政、足以垂範後此、而其外交政策、對遠東　特别視　云、</p>

<p>梅蘭芳提倡國貨之演詞　　今天、承上海市地方協會邀蘭芳來對於提倡國會的事說幾句話、蘭芳一向是不大善於辭令的、但是愛國的心、是人人都有的、所以也就自已忘丁自已的　　、大　的稍微說幾句、我們中國、這多年以來、經濟是非常的衰落、　落的原因、雖然是很多、可是「國内的實業不能振興」、也是其中最大的緣故、因爲國内的實業不能夠振興、所以外國貨也就乘機進口、外國貨的進口、一天比一天多、中國的實業、也就一天比一天衰落、而我們中國經濟上所受的損失、也就一天比一天大、這種損失、據最近的調查、每年已經達到五萬萬元之多、倘若是再不想法子、那末往後一年一年的加上去、中國的經濟、簡直要破產、經濟一破產、我們的國家、自然而然也就没有存在的可能了、我們想個什麽法子、來挽回這種難關呢、我想並不難、只要我們來努力「振興實業、」「提倡國貨、我們中國的國貨、也不見得一定怎樣的不如外國貨、而且也曾經過很受外國人所歡迎的、好比茶葉·絲·磁器·等等、在從前每年出口也不在少處、可是到了現在、也没有從前那們暢銷了、這是什麽緣故呢、就是因爲我們不知道去研究改良、來讓他有進步、所以弄得銷路一天比一天小了、我希望國内的實業家、要多多的注意這種地方、我還記得我前年在美國的時候、我們舞臺上的一切佈置、好比門　·台帪·以及所穿的行頭、都全用中國貨、我們中國所特長的一種繡貨、他們外國人看了、大家都說美觀、都非常贊美、還有我在美國的時候、除了必需西裝的時候之外、無論是宴會或是平時、總是穿着用中國綢緞所做的袍子同馬褂兒、他們都很稱贊中國材料的好看、由此、可以知道我們中國的國貨、也有很受外國人所歡迎的、我們何不再去研究研究好、運到外國去、豈不是一定可以暢銷、還可以挽回利權嗎、外國人對於我們中國貨、都這樣贊美、偏偏我們中國人、近來都喜歡廠開又結實、又美觀、又便宜的中國貨不買、偏去花大價錢買外國貨、反使我們中國的經濟上受了絶大的損失、甚至於有亡國的危險、這又何苦呢、我們大家想想、合算是不合算呢、我們中國人員外國貨、好比自已吞炸彈一樣、因爲這是完全自已害自已的、這樣長久下去、總有爆發的一天、一旦爆發起來、便可以制了我們的死命、這是多們可怕的事、多們危險的事、我勸大家千萬不要再去自已害自已罷、我近幾次到上海來、看見上海的機器工業、是很發達的、而且各廠的出口、也一年比一年多、一年比一年好、進步是非常的快、並且跟外國貨也差不多、這種毅力是很可佩服的、但願諸位提起了精神、整頓隊伍、大家努力前進、趕快去收回我們中國在實業、上所失去的地位、同時、並希望我們中國的同胞、大家來振興實業、提倡國貨、千千萬萬不要再去吞吃炸彈、自已害死自已、我說到這裏、自已就很覺得慚愧、我們大家、都是中國人、本來就應該都用中國貨、今天却來說提倡國貨、這是多麽羞恥的事呢、還希望我們的同胞、從今以後、除掉萬萬不得已的時候之外、無論如何、不要再去用外國貨、一律用我們中國自已所產的國貨、處處表現我們中國人愛國的精神、今天元旦、蘭芳來少微說幾句、我想我們大家、一定都是同情的、那我就請大家、從今天元旦日起、下一個大决心、提倡國貨、挽回利權、這不但是蘭芳個人的榮幸、並且是我們國家的幸福、你們諸位想著、今天這位九十四歲的馬相伯老先生、這麽大的年紀、還是這樣努力提倡、我們大家、應該怎麽樣學他老人家呢、我祝頌諸位到得九十四歲時候、也是這樣的精神、對於國家社會、也是這樣的努力、趁這個機會、跟諸君賀年、諸君康健、玩手溜彈受傷　　江北人郭大、年五十二歲、家住閘北張家巷路草屋内、伊子名小三子、年十五歲、於昨晨在附近拾取垃圾時、拾得手溜彈一枚、該小三子以爲玩物、當卽帶回家中、並於下午三時召其隣孩李家瑞到家同玩、相嫴不久、小三子卽思動手將彈拆視、但無由破裂、乃將彈向地猛擲數次、彈底横閂受震脫落、轟然炸裂、鐵片四飛、小三子李家瑞頭部、均被炸傷、當塲暈厥、郭大頭部、亦被波及、幸經附近臨平路四區派出所第十號崗警聞悉、急往察看、見受傷各人已不能言語、乃急僱車送往同仁醫院救治、聞傷勢甚危、性命堪虞云各善團消息　　上海閘北普善山莊、十二月份、在南北華租兩界内、收埋大棺七十九具、小棺一千八百五十一具、内計本山莊收大棺十九具、小棺一千零十一具、斜橋分莊及法租界各善堂、收來小棺三百三十六具、又公共租界各捕房及衛生處咨照、界内抛棄孩屍及騐屍所各醫院無主屍體共計大棺五十四具、小棺五百零四具、紅十字會各醫院收來大棺二具、同仁醫院收來大棺一具、聯義善會收來大棺三具、以上屍體、均由本山莊備棺收殮、運送閘北大塲塘橋義塚安葬、又新民路白十字普善醫院、施診給藥、共計三千六百號、　　上海聯益善會理事主任陸文中、連日率同職員童秋園·吳培立·張佩申·王滌身·等、分别火發各處、見有年老或衣單袴薄之人、當卽給發棉衣袴票、以資禦寒、貧民感激、莫不稱頌、華僑銀行開始營業　　係和豐華僑華部三銀行合併成立　　南洋僑胞在新嘉坡創辦之和豐華僑華商三銀行、經營多年、信用素著、每年僑胞由該三行匯欵歸國者、不下萬萬之巨、新嘉坡之匯兌率、悉依和豐掛牌爲標準、一似漉上之匯豐銀行、其匯兌業之發達、可以想見、茲聞自本年一月一日起、三行合併營業、定名華僑銀行、藉符該行爲僑胞設立之本、旨資本收足坡幣一千萬元、約合國幣二千萬元、其分行在本埠者、仍在九江路九號和豐銀行之食址、在南方者尙有香港厦門二處、在南洋者、各重要商埠、均有設立、計英屬之新嘉坡·小坡·馬六甲·麻坡·檳榔嶼·芙蓉·峇株吧轄·吉蘭丹·及吉隆坡·緬甸·仰光·荷屬之巴達維亞·巨港·及占碑·等地、歐美各埠、均有代理、故各界欲知南洋商情、欲推廣南洋營業、或採辦南洋貨物者、該行均可代爲介紹、前和豐銀行、對於南洋之進出口、押匯欵項、辦理妥善、顧客有不明瞭此種手續者、該行戰員、無不詳爲解釋、各商號因該行押匯手續之便捷、而得推廣營業者、不知凡幾、現新行成立、内部職員、一無變動、藉收駕輕就熟之利、其營業之擴張、將駕前進步、新行董事葉玉堆君·及陳延謙君·素爲坡埠商界巨子、本埠分行行長爲王正序君·鳴王正廷之胞弟、在銀行業有悠久之歷史、該行得王君主持漉行業務、來日發達、未可限量也、兩銀行檢查報告　　中央銀行發行準備第一百四十七次檢查報告云、本會依據中央銀行條例第十五條之規定、對於本行發行兌換劵準備金、負檢查之責、茲於民國二十一年十二月三十一日、由林康侯·秦潤卿·兩監事、在本行發行局、舉行第一百四十七次檢查、用將檢查結果、公告如左、（甲）兌換劵發行總額、銀元三千九百十四萬五千三百六十元、内計、銀元劵三千五百三十五萬三千七百十一元、輔幣元三百七十九萬一千六百四十九元、兌換劵準備金總額、三千九百十四萬五千三百六十元、内計、現金準備銀元三千一百八十三萬六千三百六十元、是項現金準備、計存本行發行庫二千八百四十九萬七千二百元、存各埠分支行一百四十八萬九千二百八十二元、存同業一百八十四萬九千八百七十八元、保證準備、折合銀元七百三十萬零九千元、（乙）關金兌換劵發行總額四十二萬五千元、關金兌換劵準備金總額四十二萬五千元、是項準備金、内計美金十七萬元、存本埠同業、以定價四○合關金四十二萬五千元、照中央銀行兌換劵章程第二條、現金準備百分之六十、保證準備百分之四十、此次檢查結果、現金超過六十分之數、保證不及四十之數、核與定章相符、特此報告、中華民國二十一年十二月三十一日、中央銀行監事會、　　中國通商銀行二十一年十二份、發行兌換劵及準備金、現經監察人盧少堂·傅其霖·會同會計師徐永祚、於二十二年一月二日、舉行檢查、茲將檢查結果、分列於下、（甲）銀元兌換劵發行額一千零八十二萬零八百七十三元、準備金總額、一千零八十二萬零八百七十三元、内計現金準備七百八十萬零四千八百三十六元、（六成以上）保證準備三百零一萬六千零三十七元、（四成以下）（乙）銀兩兌換劵發行額三十四萬兩、準備金總額三十四萬兩、如數現金、核與發行定章、均屬符合、天氣報告　　徐家匯天文台昨日下午四時三十分氣象預報云、山東海濱天寒有雲、風來自西南方至西北方不等、因低壓來自蒙古、向東南東方或東方進行之故、揚子流域天陰有局部之霧或濛雨、風來自西北方、馬鞍島以南沿海一帶、天陰或　、風來自北方至東北方、台灣海峽有雨、又昨日下午三時前、二十四小時内、三埠氣溫、最高四四·一、最低三六·三、去年同日、最高六七·五、最低三九·四、讀者顧問「天才」是否應當「排」　　丨黃中庸君來訊　　我是貴報一個忠實的讀者，也可以說是庸碌的人海中最庸碌的一點一滴。我向來都是借人家的報讀，但却看得非常仔細，一毫不肯放過，因此佔據了人家的報紙的時間太久，便惹人家討厭，這還罷了。還有一個壞脾胃，看了報好同人談天，往往因爲報上一個問題、便會和人爭論得面紅耳熱，這一層更使人家望而却步；我也每每自恨，不該和人做無謂之爭，總想勒住我的是非之心，閉住我的是非之口，但又往往失敗，因爲這顆心總是血肉之軀的一部，牠對於週遭所感觸的，一定要跳動，一定要發爲聲音，見諸辭色。發揮不能，禁止不得，深以爲苦。今者貴報「讀者顧問」一欄，容納讀者自由討論，實在令我怦然心動！從此以後，我可以有請敎問難的機會了。今天姑借貴報「自由談」一個問題來開始罷。豈凡先生的「排天才」一篇，我讀了好幾遍，可是越讀越令我懷着不安，特罄所懷，以質高明，㈠豈凡先生「排天才」的，「唯一的緣故，是在於天才和我們凡庸的不同，在我們的庸俗社會中，我們不要什麽天才，所以要排除他。」我要請敎：天才究竟是個什麽東西？凡庸又做怎樣的解釋，爲什麽天才和凡庸不同就要反對天才？那麽，男人和女人不同，難道丈夫也要反對妻子嗎？㈡我想豈凡先生一定要說，天才的種類很多，有「殺人的天才，搜刮的天才，騙誘的天才，誇口的天才，乃至吃飯拉矢的天才，」若果豈凡先生不是在說笑話，而是在解說天才的内容，那眞令我這樣一凡庸」的人大惑不觖了！記者先生！天才果然就這樣爛汚不値錢麽？㈢豈凡先生或許又要答道，我所以要反對天才是因爲天才「有向上心，他們要往天上爬，他們要帶了一羣人馬建功立業，他們要人跟了他轟轟烈烈一番，但他們不肯獨自去幹，他們常要引誘庸碌去附和擁護，他們要責駡庸碌的不抬舉他，不崇奉他，他們要享受庸碌的犧牲，他們要吮吸庸碌的膏血，他們要做庸碌的領袖，但他們不爭庸碌分毫恩惠。」這更使我莫明其妙了。就拿人類進化史來說罷，我們的披毛戴角的老祖宗若是没有「向上心，」自甘簡陋，不去胼手胝足，勞神焦思地在勞動過程中，創造工具，發見自然界與人類社會的必然法則以形成開物成務，養生送死，光前裕後的文明，則我們今日還在過穴居野處，茹毛飲血的生活，也未可知。「向上心」果然是人類的罪惡嗎？果然可以做爲天才的罪案嗎？因爲有了向上心，就「要帶了一羣人馬建功立業了，」就「要人跟了他轟轟烈烈幹一番，」姑且承認有這樣一種天才，但我要請敎「建功立業」「轟轟烈烈幹一番」若果不是動機在「享受庸碌的犧牲，」不是「要吮吸庸碌的膏血，」更不是「要」單純地「做庸碌的領袖，但不予庸衆分毫恩惠，」而是因爲有更高尙，更神聖，更遠大的目的，更偉大的使命，那麽「轟轟烈烈幹一番」的「向上心」或「天才，」也是罪惡麽，也應該「排」嗎？㈣再看我們豈凡先生的「庸衆的綱領」是怎樣。他說，庸衆的綱領，在於一律平等！」呵呀呀！庸衆也有綱領？庸衆也會喊出「一律平等」的口號來，也會提出「一律平等」的政綱來？那我又要請敎，：什麽政綱是庸衆提出來的？「一律平等」的政綱是由什麽一種庸衆從他們的全體的心窩裏看出來的，並且把牠歸納成這樣一個「言簡意賅」傳之百世而不悸，施之萬世而不惑」的信條的呢？「删書斷知唐虞，」以前的舊賬，我們皆不算，並且承認豈凡先生的「庸衆的政綱，」的確是庸衆自已起草的政綱，那我還要追問一句：你不是又在開玩笑罷？若果不是，我就要請敎：怎樣呌做「平等」？又怎樣呌做「一律平等」？這種平等的精神是十九世紀法國大革命的内容呢？還是二十世紀俄國大革命的内容呢？又要請敎：中國的「一律平等」怎樣實現呢？從什麽地方做起呢？我們這位庸衆的豈凡先生一定會指導我們，因爲他已經第一次指導過我們，但是還不夠，現在還要繼續請敎，這樣一來，豈凡先生已經做了我們這些庸衆的指導者丨領袖丨了，已經是有「天才」加乎其身的危險了！徘徊終日，如鯁在喉，率爾請敎，不勝恍惑！答：天才問題，本不如是之簡戰如豈凡先生所云云者，來書所指疑問各點，具見讀書切實，不愧科學家求眞求是，平心研究的態度，海内讀者必有眞知灼見，犁！然有當的解答：茲先就管見，聊復一二。天才不是别的，只是他於舉世混濁的時候，獨能以他的淸醒的頭腦，想出當時的　結所在：能用銳利的眼光，看淸當前的出路：能用敏捷的手腕處分紛至沓來的事變：能秉偉大的熱誠灌注他的一身，完成他的使命。這還是普通的說話。歷史還没有剷除不平的紀錄，就是社會還未脫離不平的現象：那末，天才也就因社會人羣的分劃而不同。譬如說罷：拿破崙是個天才，但敦，馬拉也是天才：然而他們所代表的人羣的利益却不同：又如袁世凱（假定的話）是一個天才，孫中山也是一個天才，然而他們所代表的人羣的利益也是不同的。最明顯的如列寗是一個天才，克倫斯基（假定的話）也是一個天才，然而他們所代表的社會人羣的利益，更是兩個極端。在現在的社會中，尤其是在我們這樣庸衆的社會（如平民大衆）中，天才的領袖，更是百分之百的需要。總而言之，不能把天才與『吮吸庸血的膏血····』等等現象混爲一談，不然，便是，『因爲倒澡盆的水並連小孩子也倒掉了，』這就呌做『因噎廢食！』那眞不免於『庸衆』了！摩爾Mohr說得好··『海格爾關於某種數理的公式說的，凡是常識認爲錯誤的，就是合理的，而常識的合理，就是不合理的話，在此地是適用的。』眞的，這話『在此地也是適用的。』</p>

<p>自由談	吹牛的妙用  慶女士　　吹牛是一種誇大狂，在道德家看來，也許認爲是缺點，可是在處世接物上却是一種刮刮呌的妙用。假使你這一生缺少了吹牛的本領，别說好飯碗找不到，便連黃包車夫也不放你在眼裏的。　　西洋人究竟近乎白痴，什麽事都只講究脚踏實地去作，這樣費力氣的勾當，我們聽明的中國人，簡直連牙齒都要笑掉了。西洋人什麽事都講究按步就班的慢慢來，從來没有平地登天的捷徑，而我們中國人專門走捷徑，而走捷徑的第一個江門，就是善吹牛。　　吹牛是一件不可看輕的藝術，就如修辭學上不可缺少「張喻」一類的東西一樣，像李太白什麽「黃河之水天上來」又是什麽「白髮三千丈」這在修辭學上就呌作「張喻」，而在不　修辭學的人看來，就覺得李太白在吹牛了。　　而且實際上說來，吹牛對於一個人的確有極大的妙用，人類這個東西，就有這麽奇怪，無論什麽事，你若老老實實的把實話告訴他，不但不能激起他共嗚的情緖，而且還要輕蔑你冷笑你，假使你見了那摸了淸你根底的人，你的管你家裏早飯的米是當了被褥換來的，你只要大言不慚的說「某部長是我父親的好朋友，某政客是我拜把子的叔公　我認得某某鉅商，我的太太同某軍閥的第五位太太是乾姊妹」吹起這一套法螺來，那摸不淸你的人，便貼貼服服的向你合十頂禮，說不定碰得巧還恭而且敬的請你大吃一頓燕菜席呢！　　吹牛有了如許的好處，於是無論那一類的人，都各盡其力的大吹其牛了。但是且慢！吹牛也要認淸對手方的。不然的話必難打動他或她的心弦，那麽就失掉吹牛的功效了。比如說你見了一個仰慕文人的無名作家或學生時，而你自已要自充老前輩時，你不用說别的，只要說胡適是我極熟的朋友，郁達夫是我最好的知已，最妙你再轉灣抹角的去探聽一些關於胡適郁達夫　碎的遺事，比論文藝的重要  孫福熙　　蔡子民先生初長北京大學的時候，在全體敎授會議中，一位姓何的工科學長，大發議論，主張注重工業。其時魯迅先生也說，工科是很重要的。說完以後，何先生又說了：『你們聽聽！工業之重要，不但是我學工業的人來主張，就是學文學的也是這樣說，其重要可知了。』　　魯迅老先生又起來，他說：『這話是很對的；不過，學文學的人知道工業也是重要，學工業的人却只知道工業的重要了。』　　說完坐下，於是鴉雀無聲者久之。何學長不再站起來發言了。　　提倡一業確是萬分重要，然而並不需要停了文藝的工夫。　　一個國家一個民族之能興盛長久，必須有兩個條件：其一是能夠追隨他國他民族的長處，其二是能鋔創造他國他民族所没有的長處。我們看到他人能以手造機器，須竭力的追隨，却不能先把兩脚斬掉，至於斬掉思想文藝的頭腦，那更是不成話了。　　美國是得經濟的國家，他們盡力的培養工業人才，希望有多量的產出，至於高等的藝術敎育却不肯多化錢，他們的意思，培植高深的藝術家，太消費了，還不如到法國去請來的價錢便宜。然而，美國並不是不要藝術敎育，却是請了法國藝術家來敎授而已。至於文學呢，他們還是設科研究，設學校培植高深的人才，决不因爲利祿薫心而廢止文藝。　　試考察各殖民地，敎育多係灌注生產的智識與技能，人民欲求增加文藝思想的功課而不可得。我國現在至少在形式上還不肯自承爲殖民地，還要號稱爲一個獨立自由的國家，然而現在却大有人在主張廢止文藝，這不僅有點滑稽，而且有點令人痛心！　　如說胡適最喜聽什麽，郁達夫最討厭什麽，於是便可以親親切切的呌着「適之怎樣怎樣，達夫怎樣怎樣」，這樣一來，你便也就成了胡適郁達夫同等的人物，而被人所尊敬了。　　如果你遇見一個好虚榮的女子呢，你就可以說你周遊過列國，到過士耳其南非洲丨并且還是自費去的，這樣一來就可以證明你不但學識閱歷豐富，并且還是個資產階級。於是乎你的戀愛便立刻成功了。　　他如遇見商賈，官僚，政客，軍閥，都不妨察言觀色，投其所好，大吹而特吹之，總而言之，好色者以色吹之，好利者以利吹之，好名者以名吹之，好權勢者以權勢吹之，此所謂以毒攻毒之法，無往而不利。　　或曰吹牛妙用雖大，但也要善吹，否則揭穿西洋鏡，便没有戲可唱了。　　這當然是實話，并且吹牛也要有相當的訓練，第一要不紅臉，你雖從來没有著過一本半本的書，但不妨咬緊牙根說「我的著作等身，只可恨被一把野火燒掉了丨」。你家裏因爲要請幾個漂亮的客人吃飯，現買了一副碗碟，你便可以說「這些東西十年前就有了」，以表示你并不因爲請客受窘。假如你荷包裏只剩下一塊大洋，朋友要邀你坐下來八圈，你就可以說：「我的錢都放在銀行裏，今天竟匀不出工夫去取！」假如那天你的太太感覺你没多大出息時，你就可以說張家大小姐說我的詩作的好，王家少奶奶說我臉子漂亮而有丈夫氣，這樣一來太太便立刻加倍的愛你了。　　這一些吹牛經，說不勝說，但神而明之，存乎其人！編輯室　　十二月份惠稿諸先生··　　年底歲首，本館會計處異常忙碌，十二月份稿費須本月十六日始能淸發，遲延之處，務祈鑒諒，並乞源源賜稿爲盼！長篇創作時代与愛的歧路  張資平　　「我有一個親戚在財政部當參議，姓任的。」　　「對了。他們說的就是他了！」　　卓女士此刻笑了。她那兩列整齊潔白的牙齒，在電光下望去，更加好看，有魅力。他想，假如她容許他的直接行動時，他一定伸過舌尖去一顆一顆的舐一個飽。　　「是怎樣的親戚？你和他還熟麽？」　　海泉眞不願意把他和任碩士的親戚關係告訴卓淑華。假如他和劉佩珠没有相當的交情，連任公館他都不願意上門的。本來，他和任碩士互是陌生的人，微塵的關係也没有。他和任順士如果說得上是親戚，那末只要多轉兩個拐灣，和烏嫎蟹也有裙帶的關係了。　　「間接雖有點親戚關係。我和他並没有什麽深的交情。」　　海泉無論怎樣都不肯告訴她任碩士是他的姊夫的妹夫。因爲這是多麽費觖的一個代名詞喲。　　「那末，你不常看見他？」　　卓淑華的半紅半白的臉上，表示出失望的神氣。　　「到他家裏去就可以看見他。」　　他無所謂般的回答。　　「你常到他家裏去麽？」　　「不。」　　他回答着再注意卓淑華的態度，她没有剛才那樣的興致了。　　他倆間又是一陣的沉寂。只是聽見下面的人聲嘈雜，同時又聽見附近的一陣留聲機唱片的音曲，丨丨在近來最流行的船夫曲。卓女士也發出她的低微的梭普拉娜的聲音在和着唱。海泉聽着，覺得有無限的哀愁。　　（十五）　　卓淑華的媽媽走進來了。海泉看她，年約五十多歲，臉上似乎塗上了不少的雪花膏，矮胖的身體上，穿着一件黑湖縐面的白羔皮旗袍。她的那種老太婆的神氣，稍微引起了海泉的反感。　　「林先生，這是我媽。」　　海泉略站起來向着卓媽點了點首。　　「請坐，莫使客氣。」　　卓媽的純廣州口音。　　他們正在周旋着，又走進來一個臉色蒼白的靑年。他很恭敬地向着海泉鞠躬。　　「這位是林先生？」　　他笑着問淑華。海泉看了他，覺得除身材矮小之外，他倆兄妹没有半點相似。　　恰好是四個人，各佔了八仙桌的一邊。這趟娘姨端了一盤香蕉和一盤橙子上來。　　「林先生，小女在學校裏，希望你多多指敎啊。」</p>

<p>桌上，由　飄搖不定的紅光，也能照見室中的大槪。這時候，孫老太太坐在床前，她每年如此，坐着等下一年的第一個早晨來臨，聽第一響的呌聲，以卜來年的凶吉。兩個孩子依着膝前，還不肯安睡，問奶奶噪新衣裳穿。孫老太太無可奈何，百般的撫騙，替他們脫了衣服，一邊說：『好好的睡，把今夜做的夢，告訴奶奶，明天早上吃炒年糕。』！孫老看見今年的每况愈下，想以天眞的小孩子的夢，來卜卜明年的凶吉。小孩子聽有炒年糕吃，都安穏的睡熟了。　　孫老太太睡眼迷糊的等着，等着，似乎聽見遠處的爆竹聲，窗格中確有肚白的光線透進來，同時「鵲鵲」兩聲，顯然是喜鵲的呌聲，送進她耳官，頓時多紋的臉上，露出得意的微笑；孫老太太好像有十分把握，聽見喜鵲呌，今年的好預兆是無疑的。　　兩個孫兒也同時醒了，他們張開眼來，都喊着：「奶奶我做了一個夢。」而且都坐起身來，想先說。奶奶替他們穿好衣服，「國兒，你讓哥哥先說，大家都有年糕吃，」她說。　　「奶奶，好像在半夜裏」華兒說：「門外送來了槍聲，弟弟嚇得哭了起來，大門上被許多用力搥着，原來是去年的强盜又來搶刦了······」　　「奶奶，我也是這樣。」弟弟說：同時快活得跳起脚來。　　「不要作聲，等你哥哥說完了。」　　「强盜來了，」華兒想了一想接着說··「不多一回時光，大門已經打破，衝進來十幾個矮小的惡人，他們都拿着晃亮的刀，先把奶奶綁了···」　　「是，哥哥在床邊拿出一柄手槍··」國兒忍不住搶來說了。　　「華兒，是嗎？」奶奶顯然以兩個孫兒做了同樣的夢奇怪起來。　　「是的，奶奶，我從床邊拿出一柄手槍，把爲首的兩個强盜殺了。這時候弟弟也從門旁拿起一根粗大的木棍，把其餘的强盜，都打出門外去。····　　「國兒，你不哭了嗎？」孫老太太撫着兩個孩子，把他們做的夢，竟當眞了，忘其所以的問··　　「奶奶，我見哥哥拿出手槍就不哭了，趕快拿起門旁的木棍，把强盜亂打。」　　「後來怎樣呢？」奶奶像聽了有趣的故事。　　國兒望着他哥哥，華兒也望着他弟弟，似乎說把强盜打完了後怎樣呢？　　「我忘了這是夢啊。」奶奶見兩個孩兒都没有話說，纔省悟他們講的是夢「要是去年强盜來的時候，你們這樣的對付，我們東北一所美麗的住屋，不會被奪了。從今天起，你們不能常常爲了一塊糖打起來，兩個人應敢像夢裏一樣，拿了手槍同木棍，把東北的住屋奪回來，裏面有很多的糖哩！····　　「奶奶，我們要吃···年糕···呢！」兄弟倆同聲說。　　「我忘了，我去燒，吃飽了年糕你們去打强盜，把東北的屋子奪回來」奶奶說着往廚下去了。　　「哥哥，你的手槍拿來，我們吃了年糕打强盜去！」小拳頭伸着向空中一送。「鵲鵲」兩聲，一隻喜鵲從窗外飛過。新年來了  古　　萬衆一聲除舊，　　四海同日皆新。　　呀！　　新年來了！　　民國二十二年的新年來了。　　···　　···　　···　　　　大約你不會這樣的健忘罷？　　在二十年的九月十八日曾經發生了一椿什麽事情？　　在二十一年的一月二十八日又是出了一塲什麽新聞？　　記着！　　「九一八」不是一種商標的名稱，　　「一二八」亦不是小西門的一座咖啡館；　　是東洋人送給我們的禮物，　　是日本人留給我們的遺產，　　···　···　···　　　你不應歡新，　　更不應忘舊，　　把「九一八」浸在我們的腦海，　　把「一二八」栽在我們的心田，　　自顧若何朋友，　　記好，······永遠地記牢！　　不要忘記了這奇恥大辱，　　···　···　···這世界，······這暗無天日的世界，　　已没有了什麽公理，　　只有所謂强權，　　是强權才抹殺了一切公理，　　是强權才造成了這屠殺的時代。你還要去依賴公理麽？你還要去倚托他人麽？醒吧！　　只的我們自已，　　才是這救亡者。　　···　···　···好！朋友！　　新年來了，　　你應該去仔細他回顧你自已的一切，　　丨你的健康怎樣，　　丨你的學業怎樣，　　丨你的思想怎樣，　　丨你的品行怎樣。　　···　···　···　　　往者已矣，　　來者可追，　　準備着你新的力量，　　去改造這舊的世界。朋友！　　祝你··努力！笑談  怡·怡·館·主·　　某鄕婦，因爲是初次出遠門，她到了車站上，問一個脚夫道：「喂！先生，請問那十二點鐘的一班車子，你可知道在什麽時候開」？那脚夫奇怪似的答道：「你問十二點鐘的一班車子嗎？就在十二點鐘的時候開」！　　○　　　○　　　○　　一天，先生在課室裏講理科，講的却是關乎「燐」的一種，因爲要使學生明瞭起見，於是呌學生中的某生，到儲藏室裏去拿那瓶」燐「來，以作實地的試騐。豈知某生到了儲藏室裏，瞧見那隻藏着」燐「的瓶子上，貼有一張字條紙，寫的是「不可動手！」他於是空着手，回到課室裏，那先生見他没有把那瓶」燐「拿來，很奇怪的問他道：「咦·爲什麽不把那瓶」燐「拿來」？他答道：「我因爲瞧見那隻瓶上，貼有一張寫着「不可動手」的字條，所以没有把它拿來」。市塲消息　　▲申新染廠卡德路新閘路口申新染廠，爲顏料業巨子郁秉剛等創辦，對於漂染各種綢綾布疋，均經充分之研究而從小說同情者（十一續）  張恨水　　王二嫂紅着臉把東西接過去了。低了頭道這可多謝呀。她的眼睛，雖不能隔了手巾包向裏看，可是鼻子裏，早就聞到一種化裝品的香味，這實在是自已屢次夢想不能得到的東西，現在居然得着了。滿意之餘，不覺又向孟國寳笑了一笑。他知道王老二在家裏，也不便和人家婦人多說話，也只是笑了一笑，立刻就走到門框下，向裏呌道：老二在家嗎？王老二迎了出來，他走路似乎都規矩了好些，悄悄的走近來，向他點着頭道：東家老爹來了。她說，一會兒去請你，你倒來了，請裏面坐罷。孟國寳走進來，已經看到了那個東家老爹了。他約莫有五十來歲的光景，嘴上留了一叢漆黑的鬍子，尖尖的臉上，那肌肉都向下沉着，在這點上，表示出來他的嚴肅。他穿了一身白布褂褲，不帶黃土痕跡，就是白布襪子，雙梁頭鞋，也不帶上一點灰塵。在他的褂子底擺下，垂出一截藍色的線褲帶來。他褂子胸襟的紐絆上，掛了一個垂綠繐子的眼鏡盒子，手上拿了一柄一尺多長的白紙摺扇，閑坐在一條板凳上。看見人來，他就連忙將身站起。王老二說到他是由省城裏回來的大學生。那東家老爹臉上似乎吃了一驚的神氣，立刻握了扇子，兩手相拱連道久仰。在一旁，另外有個莊稼人，帶了一挑竹籮來。一根寛扁擔，架在篾籮上，他就把那個當了板凳。王老二和孟國寳斟了一杯茶，讓他靠了小棹子坐下。大家先閑談了幾句那東家就談到租稻上來，向孟國寳道：孟先生，你府上也是收租的人，收租的苦處，你也自然知道。這幾年除了銀錢糧米要預繳之外，又是什麽加一捐，又日什麽攤消七厘公債，六釐公債，一年眞要出去不少的錢。本來照現在的田價合算起來，收租也不過是四五釐息，再要出那些花銷，收租的人，簡直地白過一年。現在一千塊錢買的田，只好收十四五擔租稻，稻就算五塊錢一擔，也不過値六七十塊錢。我們若日拿錢去放債，人家紅契抱了白契作抵押，還要出週年二分利呢，按着一千塊錢算，那就是每年二百元了，種田的人，他只說出了人工種了，他就不和東家想想。孟國寳笑道：旣然如此，作東家的人，爲什麽不把田變賣了去放債呢？東家道：這個算盤，本來人人想得通的，不過放債總是浮財，買田却是下了萬年基業。孟國寳笑道：這是作東家的人，願意只收四五分利，那就難怪佃户的了。那東家一想，這小子什麽意思，倒去和佃户帮忙。於是將扇子展開來，在胸面前不住的招展着。</p>

<h3>Skirmishes Between Chinese and Japanese Sentries on the Shihe Front</h3>
<p>Our Troops Continue to Defend West of the Shihe Area</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Villages Near Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>Japanese Gather Food and Munitions in Yucheng</p>
<p>Most of the Original Nine Japanese Warships Moored at Qinhuangdao Have Departed</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 6th, there was a small battle between sentries on both sides of the Shihe front. Several Japanese planes dropped incendiary bombs on nearby villages and towns, suspected of harboring our troops. Of the 400 Yucheng police officers, only over 50 fled to Qinhuangdao; the rest were reportedly shot and killed by the Japanese army. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The government officially announced on the evening of the 6th that the Japanese troops had withdrawn from Yuguan. Brigade Commander He is leading his troops to resist west of Shihe. Qinhuangdao is calm as usual. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After our troops withdrew from Yucheng, there has been no official contact at the front. Our first line is still on the west bank of the Shihe River. Yesterday, there was only a clash between sentries on both sides. The enemy is reinforcing troops towards Yucheng, and the puppet Fengshan Railway is extremely busy transporting them day and night. Most of the puppet troops in Jinzhou are moving towards Shanhaiguan, and the situation is quite tense. The Japanese troops are currently stationed near Yucheng and are forcing laborers on the east bank of the Shihe River to build defensive fortifications, indicating a potential large-scale invasion. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 8:00 AM this morning, the enemy forces in Yuguan launched an attack on our Shihe position with tank units and aircraft. Our 9th Brigade troops calmly responded, and after an exchange lasting over an hour, the enemy retreated. After occupying Yucheng, the enemy dispatched multiple aircraft to bomb and strafe villages inside Shanhaiguan for several consecutive days, destroying many civilian houses. Villagers east of Qinhuangdao are fleeing along the Beining Railway. The telephone line between Beiping and Yu is still open to Qinhuangdao this afternoon. Passenger tickets on the Beining Railway are being sold to Tangshan. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The number of Japanese troops in Yuguan has now increased again, totaling approximately 6,000. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, the Japanese army has been deploying large numbers of puppet troops and puppet police, mixed with Japanese troops, to disrupt our defense line. The two armies are still confronting each other on both sides of the Shihe River. Of the original nine Japanese warships moored at Qinhuangdao, after two British warships arrived, the Japanese warships successively departed. Only three Japanese warships remain in the area. Villages near Yuguan, such as Zhoujiagou, Hujiaguan, Qianmianhuazhuang, Huimazhai, Keji, Lingnan, Mengxing, and over a dozen other villages have been bombed by Japanese planes for several consecutive days. More than 2,000 residents have fled to Qinhuangdao and are sleeping in the open air due to a lack of transportation, causing many to remain stranded in the area. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese navy's landing party in Qinhuangdao planned to land and advance into the city, but they were dissuaded by British merchants. The two armies are currently still in confrontation. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An armored train of the Japanese army fired on our Shihe position outside the west gate of Yuguan at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 6th. At the same time, four Japanese planes flew over Shihe and dropped bombs. Our army returned fire at the time and retreated after fighting for about half an hour. There have been no changes at the front, and the situation is tense. Villages near Yuguan have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft, and many people have been killed or wounded. On the 5th, our cavalry outflanked the enemy's rear, hence the rumor that Yuguan had been recaptured. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chinese sources from Yuguan this morning stated that the Suzuki Brigade had arrived there. The transportation of munitions is still extremely busy. It is reported that troops on both banks of the Dashihe River exchanged gunfire yesterday afternoon and evening, but there were no other changes. (6th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Confirmed reports indicate that our troops are firmly defending the Shihe defense line. However, the Japanese army has reinforced it with one brigade and transported a large amount of munitions. The Japanese are now preparing to press us further. It is said that the first step in the Japanese plan is to seize the Luan River, and then seize the opportunity to invade Peiping and Tianjin. Our frontline officers and soldiers are extremely motivated. If the Japanese army invades again, they vow to resist thoroughly. (6th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain foreigner who inspected the front line, the Japanese are concentrating food and munitions in Yucheng, indicating preparations for an offensive. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Qinhuangdao is still severe. The Japanese army has a total of approximately 1,500 troops. The garrison commander, Morita, is currently residing along the South Sea. Our side is on high alert. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our troops continue to defend the area west of the Shihe River, building three lines of defense. East of the Shihe River, in the Yuguan area, there are approximately 6,000 Japanese troops. Japanese planes have been bombing villages near Qinhuangdao for several consecutive days, intending to level them before launching a large-scale offensive against the Chinese army. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The situation in Linyu and Qinhuangdao remains extremely urgent. On the night of the 5th, Japanese fleet commander Tsuda warned the authorities of the Chinese army stationed in Qinhuangdao, claiming that Japanese merchants in Qinhuangdao had been beaten by Chinese soldiers. He stated that if similar incidents occurred again, the Japanese landing party would take independent action and land to protect the overseas Chinese. Our side investigated and found that the aforementioned incident did not occur and has factually refuted it. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable foreign dispatches received here today, although there is calm between Yuguan and Qinhuangdao, the situation is tense. Yuguan is now fully occupied by Japanese troops, totaling 6,000. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft flew over the skies around Yuguan and dropped several bombs on villages in the suburbs, causing no major damage. The Japanese armored train is still patrolling within 500 yards of the Chinese army's line. However, the train cannot advance because a bridge was previously destroyed by the Japanese army. Yesterday, Japanese artillery units fired five rounds without provocation, bombarding the Chinese army's line, but causing no damage. Chinese shops in Qinhuangdao have now reopened. According to reliable sources, the Chinese army's line now extends from Lujiaying (transliteration) on the coast, passes east of Qinhuangdao, and extends to Xiaoshan in the interior, and is defended by infantry and cavalry units. (6th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From the 5th to the 6th, there were no changes at the front. After the Suzuki Brigade arrived in Yucheng, most of them have temporarily not advanced west. Both sides are confronting each other between the Shihe and Shasha Rivers. There are occasional minor skirmishes between sentries, but no battles. However, many empty trains from Yu are heading out of Shanhaiguan. The rebel Japanese army seems to be preparing to continue sending troops into Shanhaiguan, and the situation has not eased. Japanese warships in Qinhuangdao shine searchlights on our defenses at night. Japanese planes also frequently drop bombs on our positions on the Shihe bank. An elementary school in a certain area more than ten miles east of Qinhuangdao was hit by a bomb and caught fire. Qinhuangdao is still safe, and transportation is normal. Telephone communication is available on the Qin-Yu Road, but surveillance is strict. In Tangjiazhai, east of Qinhuangdao, Japanese troops attempted to cross the river secretly on the 5th, but they were repelled after our troops sank several small boats. A French warship is berthed in Tanggu and is still calm. Our army has a strict deployment along the coast and routes, so there is no need to worry. The Japanese side is conducting local negotiations, which the Peiping and Tianjin authorities have denied. (6th, Central Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Linyu County Magistrate Li Shufan has set up a county government office in the second district of his hometown. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain important figure in North China said that at the end of the Ming Dynasty, Li Zicheng defended against the Qing army entering Shanhaiguan and fought fiercely with Wu Sangui on both banks of the Shihe River. There is a very important mountain with two mountains more than ten miles apart and a flat sandy area in between. It is very difficult for the enemy to invade west, and it is not easy for us to counterattack. The report that our army recaptured Yucheng is not accurate. If we counterattack in the future, it will be north of Yucheng, not directly west of Yucheng. (6th, War Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Conducts Large-Scale Searches in Yuguan</h3>
<p>Obstacles Set Up Outside the Four City Gates</p>
<p>Over 400 Officers and Soldiers of the Shi Regiment Killed in Action</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Linyu has been conducting large-scale searches in Yucheng for several consecutive days. More than a dozen family members of our soldiers have been brutally killed, and countless innocent residents have been killed. Stag camps and obstacles have been set up outside the four city gates, cutting off traffic. Artillery positions have been erected at the west, south, and north city gates for strict defense. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>During the Battle of Linyu and Yuguan, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, and they also used incendiary bombs, resulting in the destruction of more than 500 shops and residences inside and outside the city by artillery fire. Approximately 1,000 people were killed or injured. Over 400 officers and soldiers of the Shi Regiment who defended the city were killed in action, and over 300 were wounded. Five people, including the commander of the first battalion, An Dexin, and company commanders Liu Yuchen, Guan Jingquan, Wang Hongyuan, and Xie Zhenfan, died together. Over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. The inside and outside of Yuguan are full of ruins and dilapidated walls, and the scene is extremely desolate. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Refugees from Yuguan said that after the Yuguan Incident, Tian Shi Middle School in Yucheng, with a total of 400 students, escaped from the east gate under the leadership of the principal and arrived at Weimazhai via Haiyang Town. Japanese planes followed and dropped bombs, and countless students were killed or injured. The hundred or so who remained in the city also died tragically under Japanese artillery fire. More than 3,000 residents of the city were killed or injured. After the city was lost, hundreds were captured and killed by the Japanese army. Only over 30 soldiers of the Shi Shian Regiment who defended the city escaped, and the rest died in battle. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Refugees who escaped from Yucheng to Tianjin said that they had to undergo strict searches by the Japanese army when they left the city. If they carried valuables, Japanese ruffians would follow them and rob them midway. People traveling from Qinhuangdao to Yuguan were stopped and turned back when they reached the Japanese army's line. If their speech was slightly off, they would be labeled as spies and shot. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Post Office Announces Suspension of Mail to Yuguan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The post office announced that it would suspend the acceptance of mail, parcels, and remittances to Yuguan starting on the 6th. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Denies On-Site Resolution of the Yuguan Incident</h3>
<p>Japanese Intention Is to Reduce the Severity</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Japanese army invaded Yuguan, they claimed that it was a local incident and would be resolved on-site with Zhang Xueliang. Zhang telegraphed Nanjing on the 6th, strongly denying this claim. It is said that the Japanese intention is to divert the attention of all parties and reduce the severity of the incident, while still encroaching step by step to achieve their ambition of aggression. (6th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the Japanese side is loudly proclaiming a local solution to the Yuguan Incident, as of this morning, no one from the Japanese side has contacted us in any way. This is likely a smokescreen. We will no longer regard the Yuguan Incident as a local issue. If the Japanese truly have the sincerity to repent, they can negotiate directly with the central government. If they use their usual cunning tactics, shouting reconciliation on one hand while continuing to oppress with force and continue to press forward, then we will resist to the end at any cost. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese embassy has not yet received instructions from Tokyo to negotiate a reconciliation, leading many Chinese to believe that Tokyo's claim to treat the Yuguan Incident as a local issue is merely intended to confuse and mislead people. (6th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Circles State That Japanese Troops Will Not Withdraw from Yuguan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for military circles here stated today that further fighting is not expected in the Yuguan area. The Kwantung Army's participation in the Yuguan campaign involved less than one infantry battalion, plus one artillery platoon. Reports that Japanese troops have withdrawn are inaccurate. Japanese troops will remain at their current positions, confronting the Chinese army across the river, awaiting Zhang Xueliang's expression of attitude. No formal ceasefire has been agreed upon by both sides. (6th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese War Dead Cremated in Yuguan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The remains of Lieutenant Kodama and 18 others who died in the general attack on Shanhaiguan were cremated at 8:00 AM on the 6th at a hastily built crematorium in the area. The cremation was performed with the utmost respect by Brigade Commander Suzuki and all unit commanders and comrades. After performing a transfer ceremony in the camp, the remains will be transported back to Japan. (6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Talk by Wang Jingwei While Recuperating in Germany</h3>
<p>Hopes the League of Nations Will Not Delay Further</p>
<p>Still Expresses Distrust of Zhang</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of the Chinese National Government, who is recuperating in Tubingen, Germany, received an Associated Press reporter at the local tropical hospital today. He assured that unless the League of Nations takes swift action on the Yuguan Incident, the prospects for world peace are bleak. Leaning on his sickbed, Wang told the AP reporter, "The League of Nations must not disregard the situation in the Far East at this time. If it continues to take no effective action, the result will have an unlimited impact on world peace. Moreover, it is not only China that is asking the League of Nations to take action. All the small countries present at the meeting are increasingly uneasy about the League of Nations' policy of inaction. With each new development, they feel more uneasy, fearing that if the League of Nations cannot resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, it will not be able to protect them if an incident occurs in their own country one day." In addition, Wang expressed a lack of confidence in Zhang Xueliang. (6th, Kuo Min News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yu Rizhang Suddenly Falls Ill in the White House</h3>
<p>While in Talks with Stimson</p>
<p>(Washington) Yu Rizhang, General Secretary of the National Young Men's Christian Association of China, suddenly fell ill today while visiting the U.S. Department of State to discuss the situation in China with Secretary of State Stimson. He was immediately sent to the U.S. Naval Hospital for treatment. The hospital doctors have not yet released information on his condition. (4th, Kuo Min Telegram)</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Meets with French Undersecretary of State</h3>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese Incident</p>
<p>(Paris) Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, met with French Undersecretary of State Claude this morning for a long discussion about the Sino-Japanese incident. The content was not released. (5th, Kuo Min News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the United States Debuchi Meets with Stimson</h3>
<p>Explains the Details of the Yuguan Incident</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Debuchi visited Secretary of State Stimson at the State Department today and explained the details of the Yuguan Incident. The main points he emphasized were as follows: 1. The Japanese army was forced to respond due to He Zhuguo's challenging actions. 2. The Japanese government has no intention of occupying Chinese territory south of the Great Wall. 3. The Japanese government is currently working towards a local resolution of the case. (5th, Rengo News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals in Qinhuangdao Temporarily Transported to Dalian</h3>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Shusen's unit, the 3rd Cavalry Brigade of our army, was originally stationed in Tongliao County. After the fall of Jinzhou, they withdrew to the Jehol border to recuperate. They have now suddenly joined forces with Zhu Jiqing's Liaoxi National Salvation Army to attack Suizhong Qiansuo and other places, creating a great momentum. The Japanese army is afraid that their rear will be cut off and is sending troops to block them while ordering the troops entering Shanhaiguan to temporarily slow down their advance. This is an important reason why the Japanese army has not actively attacked Qinhuangdao. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army's Invasion of Yu is Another Touchstone for the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Yan and Guo, the Two Representatives, Return to Geneva</p>
<p>Will Urge the League of Nations to Swiftly Adopt Effective Measures</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese Chief Representative, Yan Huiqing, and the Minister to London, Guo Taiqi, have arrived here today. Therefore, the League of Nations is ready to reopen the debate on the Manchurian Incident. Before arriving in Geneva, Yan had a long meeting with Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, in southern Germany. After Yan and Guo arrived, they are still awaiting detailed instructions from the Nanjing government, so they are unwilling to make any statements. They only said that the recent incidents in Yuguan have made China more urgently request the League of Nations to quickly deal with the overall Sino-Japanese dispute. Furthermore, the League of Nations is discussing Manchuria matters at a time when the sound of cannons is booming in the Jehol area, so the panic is even greater. This clearly indicates that it is not China and Japan that are on trial, but the League of Nations itself, because the League of Nations itself should be punished for its lack of power and courage in holding the position of an international court. As for what the League of Nations feels, it is also helpless. When asked about the Manchurian situation by senior officials of the League of Nations, they only said "danger is uncertain," etc. The rest clearly indicated that the actions of the Japanese army have placed the League of Nations in a dilemma and unable to save itself. Judging from the current situation, the League of Nations can no longer make concessions to Japan. Although the Japanese government has skillfully concealed its actions, the League of Nations must strictly enforce its claims. There is also a rumor that Japan may withdraw from the League of Nations at an early date. (5th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Our Representatives Report the Truth About the Yu Incident to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations today forwarded to the Secretariat of the League of Nations the official telegram from the Nanjing government regarding the Shanhaiguan Incident. The content is as follows: "According to Zhang Xueliang's telegram of January 3, he received a telegram from Brigade Commander He Zhuguo from Shanhaiguan on January 2, reporting the following facts. On January 1, before openly attacking Shanhaiguan, the Japanese army first had its own military police bomb the gate of the Japanese army headquarters. Afterwards, many bombs were thrown in the vicinity. At the same time, a team of "Manchukuo" police fired several shots. Brigade Commander He sent Secretary Chen to the Japanese army headquarters to inquire about the cause of the incident. The Japanese side replied that they had not received a confirmed report and requested Brigade Commander He to start an investigation. The Japanese army also demanded that all residents in Shanhaiguan City evacuate to avoid unforeseen dangers and set a deadline of 50 minutes for a reply. Around midnight, the Japanese side made four more demands: 1. The south gate of Shanhaiguan should be patrolled by Japanese troops. 2. The Chinese side should withdraw the defending troops at the south gate. 3. The Chinese side should withdraw the police force stationed at the south gate. 4. The Chinese side should withdraw the troops stationed along the city walls of Shanhaiguan. The above demands required an immediate reply. If the reply was not satisfactory to the Japanese side, they would launch a general attack on Shanhaiguan City. The Japanese side further demanded the opening of the south gate and the patrolling of the south side of the Great Wall by Japanese troops. Brigade Commander He resolutely rejected these demands. The Japanese army then assembled and attacked. The Chinese police force outside the south gate was the first to be disarmed, and the police chief of the horse police station was arrested. On January 2, at 8:00 AM, three trains of Japanese infantry, totaling over 3,000 troops, arrived at Shanhaiguan protected by one armored train. Around 10:00 AM, they began to attack. Japanese planes dropped bombs on the city. For the purpose of legitimate defense, our army had to retaliate. Both sides suffered heavy losses. On January 3, General He Zhuguo had another report, stating that Japan proposed negotiations for a peaceful resolution in order to delay time and wait for reinforcements to arrive. However, Japanese reinforcements continued to arrive. At 10:00 AM on January 3, two annihilation fish boats arrived. The south gate of Shanhaiguan was attacked by Japanese land, sea, and air forces. The fighting was extremely fierce. The Japanese army attempted to climb the city walls but was repelled by our army. The Japanese suffered many casualties. The Japanese army failed to achieve its goal and retreated after 11:00 AM. (6th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Representative Gu Writes to the League of Nations, Requesting Swift Action to Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>Transmits Telegrams from Various Shanghai Public Organizations</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan Huiqing, the Chinese Representative to the League of Nations, recently sent the following document to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, requesting that it be forwarded to the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly. The document stated: "I have recently received a telegram from various important public organizations in Shanghai, which states: Japanese troops are now concentrated in Jehol. The League of Nations has not yet taken any definite measures regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. If this continues to hesitate, the plan that can be formulated for a fair resolution of the dispute in the future will probably have no practical effect. In view of this, our associations appeal to the League of Nations to take practical measures immediately so that the situation will not become more serious. Jointly requested by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Shanghai Money Industry Association, etc. We are sending this to you for your perusal." In response to Yan Huiqing's request, the Secretary-General has forwarded the document to the Committee of Nineteen. (5th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>英法曾允[不干涉日本之「滿洲計劃」P]　　＝英日密約說絶非無因＝　　＝國聯存在價値極薄＝</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Amazing news has emerged from the United States, stating that when the Japanese army withdrew from Shanghai, England and France had agreed not to interfere with Japan's Manchurian plan. According to observations, during the Shanghai battle, the British side, fearing it would hinder their commercial development, actively sought reconciliation, and the Japanese army's withdrawal from Shanghai was unusually swift. When the League of Nations convened, the representatives of Simon and Canada recklessly sided with Japan, suggesting that the theory of a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement is by no means groundless. If true, then the hideous faces of various imperialists are exposed without reservation, and the value of the League of Nations' existence is also extremely insignificant. The Chinese people should pay close attention. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Volunteer Army Occupies Tieling County</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to reports from Harbin, after Bai Riqing, the special military commissioner of the 5th Route Army of the Northeast National Salvation Army, was arrested, it was rumored for a time that Wei Shimin, the political commissioner, had also been arrested. In fact, Wei is working in the Tieling County (southeastern Heilongjiang) area. Tieling is located north of Daqing Mountain. During the winter, hunters entering the mountains must pass through the county seat. Wei took the opportunity to gather his troops at Luotuo Slope, forty miles east of the county, and fifty men disguised as hunters entered the county street on December 18th and stayed in various inns. The remaining troops were divided into three teams, surrounding the east, south, and west gates of the county at 5:00 a.m. the next day. First, firecrackers were set off as a signal, and the city responded. After the city gate was opened, gunfire erupted. The puppet police were awakened in their sleep and were at a loss. Wei's troops entered the city at 6:30 a.m. The puppet police surrendered. The puppet county magistrate, surnamed Li, and the puppet police chief, Qi Wenjia, escaped through the north gate. Wei issued a notice to reassure the people in the name of Chief Supervisor Zhu Jiqing. It is reported that the Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Suihua County were greatly alarmed and have prepared a counterattack. Ding Chao's army is still intact.</p>
<p>(Harbin) Although the Japanese army advanced on the eastern side of Harbin according to its predetermined city-seizing procedure, it ultimately failed to eliminate the volunteer army. According to information obtained here, the anti-Manchu army is still active. Whenever they encounter the Japanese army, they retreat, so there has never been a major battle. According to a report received from the Japanese side today, Ding Chao has now arrived in Baoqing, which is ninety miles north of Mishan. The troops and artillery under his command are still intact. It is reported that other volunteer armies are currently retreating to Dongning, southeast of Suifenhe. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Capital Gambling Case</p>
<p>Police Seize Gamblers Based on Secret Report</p>
<p>Many Gamblers Hold Important Positions in the Police Department</p>
<p>Onlookers Blocked the Street</p>
<p>Wu Siyu Will Resign to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the second day of the New Year, someone secretly reported to the Military Commission and the police bureau that there was suspicious activity at the residence of Hu Deliang (secretary of the police department) at No. 84 Hongwu Street, suggesting illegal activity. The Military Commission immediately dispatched a special team to surround the residence together with the police of the First Bureau. Upon entering, they discovered several people playing mahjong. The gamblers were Qian Dayong, chief of the general affairs section of the police department, Wang Dasui, captain of the security team, Bian Yasan, commander of the security brigade, and a luxuriously dressed woman. On the table were a complete set of mahjong tiles, banknotes totaling 315 yuan, and 15 silver dollars. The homeowner, Hu Deliang, escaped by climbing over the wall at the time. Although the soldiers and police who seized the gamblers knew that the gamblers were all important figures in the police department, the matter had come to this point, and the public was watching. It was difficult to be lenient. Therefore, the four gamblers were escorted to the police station in charge. When passing through the streets, the spectators were blocked the street. The woman found the situation particularly embarrassing, while the other three seemed infinitely surprised. After arriving at the police station, guards were assigned to monitor them. Subsequently, Director Wu guaranteed to the Military Commission that they would be taken back and dealt with severely. It is said that each person has already been dismissed from their positions pending interrogation. After this incident occurred, it became a topic of gossip in the city. The "China Evening News" in the capital reported on it in detail, so sales increased sharply. It was impossible to buy it the next day. It is said that the police bureau bought it all. The initiation and reporting of this matter seem to have an inside story, involving personal grievances. It is also rumored that Director Wu is prepared to resign to take responsibility.

<p>丨Talks With a Certain Dignitary丨</p>
<p>=Japan's Actions Are Difficult to Predict=</p>
<p>=The Yushu Incident May Expand=</p>
<p>Various Dignitaries Hold Informal Discussions on Response Plans</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to military news, a certain dignitary said that the government has long been determined to resist Japan and has made considerable arrangements. The people of the country can rest assured. Japan's sudden occupation of Shanhaiguan this time seems to be aimed at Rehe, not Tianjin and Beiping. However, its actions are difficult to predict. If it is easy to occupy Tianjin and Beiping, it may directly attack Tianjin and Beiping. In short, this matter cannot be resolved overnight and is very likely to expand. Japan's plan is to prepare for a world war. It is now concentrating 400,000 troops in the Xing'an Mountains to confront Russia. It is paying attention to the coastal areas of China, especially Shandong and Fujian. If it occupies these two places, it can cut off the connections between the Yangtze River basin and the Pearl River basin, and between the Yangtze River basin and the Yellow River basin. Internally, it can strangle China's throat, and externally, it can confront the United States. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>The Course of the Japanese Army's Invasion of Yuguan</p>
<p>=Joint Operations by Army, Navy, and Air Force=</p>
<p>=Japanese Troops Stationed in Manchuria Enter the Pass One After Another=</p>
<p>=The Loss of the Natural Barrier Astonishes Foreigners=</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondent: After Su Bingwen's troops retreated to Russian territory, the Japanese army believed that there were no more problems in the three eastern provinces and regarded Rehe as an object in the puppet state's grasp. On December 8, they provoked a provocation in Yuguan, firing 38 artillery shells into the city, only to test their edge and gauge the attitude of our authorities in order to determine the steps and strategies for attacking Rehe. As a result, it was peacefully resolved with the words "it was a misunderstanding." Now, the Japanese and puppet armies are actively increasing troops to western Liaoning and building several roads for automobiles directly to Rehe, as well as completing all military and aggressive preparations. They took advantage of the fact that He Zhuguo, the commander of our 9th Brigade, went to Beiping to resign and the military's morale was low, and attempted to take Yuguan in one fell swoop. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Was Defeated in the First Day of Battle</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. on the first day of this month, Orikawa, the captain of the Japanese military police garrison in Yuguan, notified the Japanese residents there to retreat into the Japanese military camp in the South Sea within five hours to take refuge. That day, it was the New Year's holiday. Upon receiving this notice, they helped the old and carried the young, and crossed the railway towards the South Sea. When the Chinese saw this, they knew that great chaos was about to occur, and the people were extremely panicked. However, the authorities tried their best to suppress it, pointing out that the Japanese army was causing trouble for themselves, and determined to quell the matter and seek peace in order to prevent accidents from happening. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 p.m., a Japanese troop train arrived from Suizhong, and the Japanese soldiers got off the train and were stationed near the station, firing guns at will. At 10:40 p.m., several explosions were suddenly heard near the Japanese garrison headquarters west of the station. Then, the Japanese military camp in the South Sea used heavy artillery to fire into the city, for a total of five shells. Our garrison in the city remained calm and ignored it. Then, they sent personnel to question the Japanese army about the reason for the shelling. Orikawa, the commander of the Japanese garrison, replied that someone had attacked the headquarters in the past, and there was gunfire in the city. Our army fired artillery as a means of self-defense. The tone was very funny, and they could not get to the point. Our brigade headquarters reported the situation to He (Zhuguo), the brigade commander in Beiping, asking him to return to Yuguan to take charge as soon as possible. At 10:50 p.m., Japanese soldiers cut off the telegraph and telephone lines. At the same time, they commanded 200 to 300 plainclothes puppet soldiers to scale the city walls with ladders, intending to enter the city, open the city gates, and occupy Linyu County in one fell swoop. When they were spotted by our defending soldiers, they were repelled. This was the beginning of our army's counterattack. Among this group of plainclothes soldiers were Japanese officers directing them. Seeing that his trick had failed, Orikawa immediately telegraphed Nakamura, the commander in Tianjin, and Nishiki, the commander of the 8th Division, in Jinzhou, asking them to send troops into the pass quickly. From then on, gunfire from the station and outside the southeast pass did not stop all night. Our Public Security Bureau was attacked several times by the Japanese army with machine guns and hand grenades. Fortunately, Chief Mao Fucheng directed the police to repel them.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Was Defeated Again in the Second Day of Battle</p>
<p>At 5:00 a.m. on the second day, a Japanese armored vehicle that had bombed Yuguan on December 8 arrived. Before long, another troop train arrived. The armored vehicle drove to Qinhuangdao and returned to Shihe Station. At 5:30 a.m., the bombardment began, aimed at the headquarters of the 9th Brigade and the Beiyingzi Xiguan area. On average, about three shells were fired per minute. The shelling stopped at 6:20 a.m. The sound of rifles and machine guns sounded and stopped from time to time. Japanese flags were found on the Great Wall south of the railway. At this time, the order was extremely chaotic. The residents in the city were extremely panicked, so the north gate was opened to allow the people to escape. The east, south, and west gates were tightly closed. At 7:00 a.m., the Japanese garrison headquarters sent personnel to deliver a message from the 8th Division to our 9th Brigade headquarters, forcing our army to give up Linyu County in order to avoid misunderstandings. Our brigade headquarters immediately reported the situation to the Military Commission in Beiping via wireless telegraph and asked for instructions on how to proceed. At about 10:00 a.m., four troop trains and three armored trains arrived from Jinzhou, Suizhong, and Xingcheng. Without waiting for our side to reply to the message, they officially launched an attack on our army's defenses at 10:10 a.m., and five planes soared and dropped bombs. Our army, by this point, had no room for tolerance. For legitimate self-defense, they officially counterattacked. Thereupon, the sound of machine guns, mortars, and artillery was as dense as a string of pearls. After an hour of fierce fighting, there were casualties on both sides. The ceasefire was reached at 11:30 a.m. At noon, the Japanese armored train blew up the Shihe railway bridge.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Stationed in Tianjin Made Unreasonable Demands</p>
<p>At noon on the 2nd, Nakamura Takataro, commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, saying: "At 9:30 p.m. on the first day, someone threw several bombs at the Japanese military police garrison headquarters in Yuguan and attacked with machine guns and rifles, causing one Japanese officer to die and two soldiers to be injured. Recently, the Northeast Army has been actively increasing troops to Rehe. The incident on the night of the first day was obviously a planned and step-by-step provocative act. The Japanese army believes that the situation is extremely serious and has been forced to adopt self-defense countermeasures. If the incident and losses caused by this, your army should bear the responsibility and quickly stop the above-mentioned improper behavior. Otherwise, the situation will expand, affect North China, and cause unfortunate incidents. Your army should bear full responsibility. The Japanese army will not take the blame," etc. The wording was absurd, obliterating the facts, and contained blood. He translated the telegram into Western languages and sent it to the British, American, German, and Russian newspapers in Tianjin, intending to confuse world opinion and shirk the responsibility. Moreover, He Zhuguo, the brigade commander of the 9th Brigade and commander of the Linyong Garrison, defended Yuguan in an extremely difficult environment and was unable to be understood by the people of the country, so he requested to resign. After being persuaded by Zhang Xueliang, he passed through Tianjin eastward on the morning of the 2nd. At 2:00 p.m., he arrived in Qinhuangdao. At 4:00 p.m., he sent an armored train to the west bank of Shihe to cover the workers repairing the bombed railway bridge. At dusk, Brigade Commander He rode east from Qinhuangdao and then went to other places to deploy military affairs. Eight Japanese warships were stationed in Qinhuangdao, and four Japanese warships were stationed in Shanhaiguan. From the evening of the 2nd, the Japanese warships used searchlights to scout in all directions, stopping all night, and the sound of machine guns did not stop all night.</p>
<p>Yuguan Was Lost in the Third Day of Battle</p>
<p>At 8:00 a.m. on the morning of the 3rd, six Japanese planes arrived at Yuguan and circled several times, dropping more than ten bombs. At 9:00 a.m., another plane flew from Yuguan over Qinhuangdao to Nandasi Beidaihe Liushou Camp Changli to scout our army'</p>

<p>The joint force advanced towards Xiuyan on the 24th and surrounded 4,000 Yi army troops in Xiuyan. They suffered considerable losses due to Japanese air raids. Li Zirong's unit of over 1,000 men retreated to the southeast of Chai Mu Cheng. The 3,000-man unit of San Wang Quan Yi and Di Kao Tian severed the two South Manchuria Railway lines between Anshan and Zhongtai’an and entrenched themselves. On the 25th, they engaged in fierce fighting with the Iwata Itazu unit of the Japanese army at Bapanling, east of Dagushan. The current battle situation is still unknown. Respectfully reported. Winter (2nd) Hai, National Products Year New Year's Opening Ceremony.</p>
<p>Motorcade Parade Draws Enormous Crowds.</p>
<p>Shanghai West Exhibition Concludes Yesterday.</p>
<p>Various organizations, including the Municipal Local Association, the National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and the Joint Association of Machine-Made National Products Factories, initiated a major "National Products Year" campaign for the New Year. At 12 noon, an opening ceremony was held at the Shanghai Chinese Vocational School in Lujiabang. At 1 PM, a large motorcade parade took place. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Over 500 people attended the opening ceremony, including the President, Wu Tiecheng, the Vice Presidents, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Huang Renzhi, Lin Kanghou, Pan Yangyao, Gui Yanfang, Jiang Wenyu, Du Chongyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Zuocai, and Tao Leqin. Du Chongyuan presided over the ceremony and delivered the opening speech, stating that this year is designated as the National Products Year, with the first day of the year marking the opening of the National Products Year. He expressed hope that everyone would use national products to prevent the outflow of wealth and save the current crisis. Subsequently, President and Mayor Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech, stating that today marks the beginning of the National Products Year, and also the beginning of China's revival (photo by Xu Tianzhang). China is severely ill because its blood has been flowing out year after year, bringing it to the brink of death. In the future, we must save the country practically. (1) Passively, the entire nation should revert to the "frugal" lifestyle of 50 years ago. (2) Actively, starting from today, the beginning of the National Products Year, we must manufacture, promote, and purchase national products, and then China's crisis can be averted.</p>
<p>▲ Motorcade Parade: The cars participating in the parade from various manufacturers were decorated with ingenuity, filled with slogans promoting national products. They drove to Lujiabang Road one after another, assembled and numbered, and received the "National Products Year" flags, arranged in order. At 1 PM, the parade began, with Xiang Kangyuan as the general commander and Wang Zuocai as the deputy commander. The Shanghai Municipal Police Band and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts led the way, followed by a fire truck from the Second District Fire Brigade, ringing the bell to awaken the nation. Workers rode in rickshaws, heads wrapped in white cloths, holding the memorial tablets of the anti-Japanese heroes of the Northeast righteous people, which was a sight to stir the heart. A total of 65 trucks and over 40 cars from participating manufacturers, and an ambulance carrying paramedics sent by the Health Bureau, departed from the intersection of Lujiabang and Fangxie Roads, passed through Laoximen, along Zhonghua Road to Xiaodongmen, then took Minguo Road, turned onto Waitan via Xin Kaihe, and passed through Avenue Edward VII to Avenue Montegnie intersection, turned into Xizang Road, turned onto Fuzhou Road and Henan Road, crossed Tian Hou Gong Bridge, and went straight to the North Railway Station to disperse. The route was heavily guarded by military and police, and the crowds of citizens watching were like clouds, lasting until 5 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Lu Xi Exhibition: The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' National Products Promotion Association sponsored the Lu Xi National Products Mobile Exhibition, which lasted for two weeks. Due to repeated requests from various groups and leaders in Lu Xi, the exhibition was extended for three days. The commercial venue was closed the night before last, and yesterday morning at 9 AM, a closing ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Third Branch of the Municipal Citizens' Association. Over 80 representatives from various sectors and factories, as well as members of the association, attended and performed the ceremony. Chairman Chen Yiting delivered the closing remarks, and Chen Binghui reported on the progress. The total number of visitors was 396,478, with sales reaching 134,852 yuan and expenses totaling over 2,580 yuan.

<p>Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center.</p>
<p>▲ Sun Zhesheng and others hold a tea party.</p>
<p>▲ Over 60 signatories.</p>
<p>Chinese Committee Member Sun Zhesheng, desiring to clarify the principles and theories of Sun Yat-sen, restore inherent Chinese culture, and nurture the spirit of the nation, initiated the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center. Over one hundred people had already signed up to initiate the project during the Third Plenary Session. Sun considered Shanghai as the location for the center, as it is a hub for talent across the country. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month at 3 PM, he, along with Ye Gongchuo, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Chaochu, Zhang Dingfan, and others, jointly invited leaders from various sectors in the city to hold a tea party on the 9th floor of the YMCA on Baxianqiao. Ma Chaojun, Liang Hancao, Chen Jianru, Wang Kunlun, Chen Bin, and Li Dachao hosted the event. Over 100 attendees included Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Sen Kanghou, Zheng Hongnian, Huang Hanliang, Tie Xinzhi, Zhang Shouyong, Wu Yunzhai, Li Denghui, Huang Renzhi, Wu Jingxiong, Pan Xulun, Xu Xinliu, Dai Ji, Huang Boqiao, Zheng Yuxiu, Chu Fucheng, Mei Lanfang, Mu Ouchu, Guo Le, Li Minzhou, Feng Shaoshan, Chen Qun, Wang Binyan, Yu Cheng, and Lei Yin. Sun Zhesheng presided over the meeting, with Chen Duanzhi as the secretary.</p>
<p>Chairman Sun delivered the opening remarks, saying, "I am deeply grateful for the presence of individuals from all circles in Shanghai. The purpose of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center has been detailed in the prospectus, and its organization is also outlined in the regulations. This matter has been brewing in my heart for a long time, but due to the troubles in the country, I have been unable to announce its establishment earlier. Last winter, upon arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong, I observed that foreign aggression was becoming increasingly urgent, and domestic troubles had not ceased. To remedy this deep-seated illness, psychological reconstruction is key. We must draw upon the principles of Sun Yat-sen and his theories, using the restoration of inherent Chinese culture as the foundation and the absorption of modern emerging civilization as the framework, to nurture national spirit and create core beliefs. This will transform the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center, which has been lingering in my mind for several years but has not been realized, into a concrete plan. Just as the capital was convening the Third Plenary Session, I printed and circulated the prospectus and regulations, and over one hundred people signed up as initiators, all agreeing that this is a plan for the century, and there is no other way. It is not just about promoting and expanding Sun Yat-sen's principles and theories. However, the implementation of this plan depends on collective effort. As the location of the center is in Shanghai, and Shanghai is a hub for talent across the country, I am taking advantage of the New Year holiday to invite everyone here, hoping that you will not hesitate to offer your guidance and express your insights, so that we can gather wisdom and see its early success."</p>
<p>Ye Yuhu's Speech: "At this moment when internal and external troubles are pressing us, some may think that cultural undertakings are not urgent. However, the cause of national disasters is multifaceted, but the main reason is the loss of core beliefs among the Chinese people. Because of the loss of core beliefs in thought, behavior inevitably deviates from the right path, and national affairs become unmanageable. As the quality of the people is poor, how can we expect them to achieve full success in international competition? Therefore, I believe that the root of various negative phenomena in society, politics, economy, and diplomacy in recent years is not difficult to diagnose. I believe that if we want to save China today, we must quickly build core beliefs, and there is no other good way. In recent years, because the Chinese people are dissatisfied with various phenomena in the country, they have become suspicious of the Kuomintang's propositions, and at the same time, they have even become suspicious of Sun Yat-sen's various principles. They do not know that Sun Yat-sen's legacy is what he told us. If we try to examine them in detail, have they been clearly seen in the facts? Moreover, over the years, many party members have engaged in political activities, but few have engaged in cultural activities. They do not know that Sun Yat-sen's legacy is actually to make cultural education the foundation for improving the nation. In recent years, senior party members have been busy with political and military affairs, and they have inevitably put cultural education aside. This is indeed a reversal of priorities, which not only fails to enhance the nation's position but also fails to cope with the world's trends. From this, we see that the nation is declining day by day, and its undertakings are deteriorating day by day. Dangers are everywhere, and the nation will perish soon. Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have always been saddened by the lack of strength to resist foreign aggression. They do not know that the inability to resist foreign aggression lies not in the lack of strength but in the lack of spirit. Therefore, if we want to save this crisis and overcome this difficulty, we must first concentrate our beliefs in the subconscious of the people, extract a common thing, and make it concrete in order to make it popular. More importantly, there must be an organization to prepare to shoulder this responsibility. The establishment of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center is indeed a vital plan for today. However, Sun Yat-sen's propositions on cultural education are not very complete in his writings, so they often only provide an outline without specifying the methods. I believe that we have a responsibility to interpret, extend, and supplement them, so that Sun Yat-sen's various propositions can follow the procedures and be realized, and so that the people can have a new understanding and belief in Sun Yat-sen's various propositions. In this way, the current various difficulties can be overcome with Sun Yat-sen's propositions, and the foundation for the nation's permanent survival can be laid. This is what my colleagues and all of you present here should work together to achieve."</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech: "China has recently been greatly affected by the world's economic trends, which has led to confusion in politics, economy, culture, and so on. From villages to cities, from young people to intellectual leaders, everyone is in a state of indecision and at a loss for what to do. This kind of era sickness was originally a product of the extreme development of assets in European and American countries. It is strange that China has not yet broken away from the handicraft era. It is precisely as Sun Yat-sen said that there is only great poverty and small poverty, but there are no so-called big capitalists. It should not commit this super-era era sickness. The reason is that the old culture is lost and the new culture has not yet been formed, so there is a gap. Therefore, once it is impacted by foreign trends, it will waver and be confused by the trends. This is why Sun Yat-sen insisted on engaging in psychological reconstruction after the revolution. I have followed Sun Yat-sen for a long time, and I cannot say that it is temporary. I am ashamed that I have not yet promoted and expanded Sun Yat-sen's unfulfilled ambitions. Now, fortunately, the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center has been established, and we should gather scholars from the country to study together and focus on how to establish the foundation of culture and how to nurture the life of the nation. The overall difficulties will be overcome, and the local disputes will be resolved. This city is the center of the country, and I hope that you will all support this center. The purpose of this center is to nurture the life of the nation. Helping this center is helping the country."</p>
<p>Shi Liangcai's Speech: "I heard that fighting broke out again in Shanhaiguan last night, and they are still fighting hand-to-hand. It seems that we cannot live here peacefully and talk about culture. However, military resistance has been ineffective for a long time, and the nation is declining, which is becoming more and more intense. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the revival of the nation, but unfortunately, he died before his great achievements were completed. In recent years, culture has been lagging behind, and education has gone bankrupt. If this continues, the nation will suffer the pain of extinction. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven must also be sighing. Now, Mr. Zhesheng has established the Cultural and Educational Center, which is essential for both private and public reasons. I hope that Mr. Zhesheng will devote all his energy to running the center in the future, and I hope that Mr. Zhesheng will go from being a party and state leader to being a party and state doctor, to find the cause of the nation, the country, and society's illnesses, and to prescribe an effective prescription. If we can set the direction and follow it, we will all be willing to cooperate and work together to achieve it."</p>
<p>Huang Renzhi's Speech: "I believe that Mr. Zhesheng's move is both loyal and filial, and we should all support it within our power. I believe that China's old culture should be preserved, and new culture should be absorbed. However, if we talk about material aspects of the old culture, the first thing that comes to mind is Beijing. Since the location of the center is in Shanghai, if we can bring relics from Beijing for display at the time of its establishment, it will not only be in line with the name and reality, but also arouse the interest and attention of the Chinese people. I hope that this is appropriate and should be discussed."</p>
<p>Liu Zhan'en's Speech: "I believe that the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center is actually a people's university. Although there are many universities now, many are large but not scholarly, scholarly but not large, or even neither large nor scholarly. The Cultural and Educational Center is both large and scholarly, and it should follow Sun Yat-sen's meaning of government by the people, of the people, and for the people, so that all the people can join it. It is not possible to limit it to knowledge, and it is even more impossible to limit it to property. The goal is to allow everyone to enjoy it."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoying's Speech: "I just listened to the chairman's report and everyone's brilliant remarks, which made me feel infinite sympathy and hope for the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center. Mr. Shi said that in recent years, culture has been lagging behind, and education has gone bankrupt. If this continues, the nation will suffer the pain of extinction. As someone who is engaged in education, I feel this even more. In the past few decades in China, those who have been in charge of education have focused on academic skills and neglected the spirit and thought. As those who teach are indecisive, those who receive instruction have no place to go. Therefore, there are many talents in material construction in the country, but all undertakings in society have not yet entered the stage of construction. Education does not focus on spirit and thought, so young people are not properly guided and feel doubtful, frustrated, and decadent. Those who are eager to find a way out, even if they go astray, will not hesitate. As a result, they learn what is not used, and use what is not learned, and become the situation of today. Sun Yat-sen's psychological construction is originally a giant wheel to promote the times and a precious treasure to revive the nation. As the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center is based on this, I should also follow in the footsteps of the giant wheel and offer this precious treasure to contribute a part of the strength of the women's world."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Sun delivered a speech of thanks, and the meeting adjourned at about 6 PM. A total of sixty-eight people signed up as initiators on the spot.</p>
<p>Repayment of Principal for Financial and Troop Reduction Public Bonds Drawn the Day Before Yesterday.</p>
<p>A Total of 660,000 Yuan of Principal Repaid.</p>
<p>The fourth repayment of principal for the short-term financial public bond of 1931 and the tenth drawing for the repayment of principal for the troop reduction public bond of 1929 were held at the Bankers' Association on the morning of January 5th at 10 AM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report:</p>
<p>Chairman Zheng Lai, Director of the Public Bond Department of the Ministry of Finance, reported that the total amount of the short-term financial public bond issued in 1931 was 80 million yuan. Apart from the first to third principal installments that have already been drawn and repaid, this time is the fourth repayment of principal, with two bonds being drawn, each worth 80,000 yuan, totaling 160,000 yuan of principal. This accounts for two thousandths of the total amount of the public bond issued. Therefore, the drawing method should use the last three digits of the same number as the winning bonds. In addition, the total amount of the troop reduction public bond issued in 1929 was 50 million yuan. Apart from the first to ninth repayments that have already been drawn and repaid, this time is the tenth repayment of principal, with one bond being drawn, totaling 500,000 yuan of principal. This accounts for one percent of the total amount of the public bond issued. Therefore, the drawing method can still use the last two digits of the same number as the winning bonds.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers:</p>
<p>After the chairman finished his report, the supervisors checked the drawing sticks and the register of drawing sticks to ensure that they were correct, and then executed the drawing. The winning numbers are recorded below: (1) Two short-term financial public bonds of 1931: "174" and "447"; (2) One troop reduction public bond of 1929: "73." The short-term financial public bond is scheduled to be paid from the 15th of this month, and the troop reduction public bond is scheduled to be paid from the 31st of this month. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in various places will pay the principal and the interest due together. Regardless of the location, payment will be made in national currency.</p>
<p>Jianghua Steamer Damaged in Collision.</p>
<p>Responsibility is Clear... The Steamer Enters the Factory for Major Repairs.</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghua steamer, which sailed from Hankou to Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, collided with the Dollar Steamship Line's President Van Buren near the Pukou Baidu Bridge, causing significant damage. The Jianghua has entered the factory for major repairs, and a claim for compensation was filed with the Dollar Steamship Line yesterday. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Collision Situation:</p>
<p>The Jianghua steamer came to Shanghai from Hankou, fully loaded with passengers and cargo. It entered Wusong at 11 AM on the 3rd and drove slowly in front of the Meifu Wharf. At 11:30 AM, it passed the Gonghexiang Wharf. Because it was sailing against the current, its speed was slow. The captain of the Jianghua, Chen Jin Yu, saw the Dollar Steamship Line's President Van Buren steamer approaching head-on. The Jianghua gave a short blast of its horn, and the American steamer also gave a blast. By the time it approached the Ri Qing Wharf and passed the Luoyang Maru, the captain of the Jianghua, Chen Jin Yu, saw the American steamer moving forward with the current at a high speed and quickly ordered it to turn to the right to avoid it. At 11:40 AM, Chen saw the American steamer approaching and was shocked. He immediately put the engine in reverse, but the bow of the ship had already been hit by the American steamer. At that time, all the passengers on the ship were in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Significant Damage:</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Jianghua had put the engine in reverse, so the point of impact was at the bow of the ship. The keel had been broken, and the upper deck was also destroyed. Fortunately, the point of impact was above the waterline and did not affect the hull of the ship. At 11:50 AM, it finally docked at the Jin Liyuan Wharf. At that time, it was during customs closure. The captain reported to the main office and immediately requested a surveyor. Jia Yang Company was sent to the scene to survey. At the same time, the harbor master of the customs and Dollar Steamship Line were informed. The President Van Buren steamer still sailed out of the port that day. After the Jianghua unloaded its cargo and passengers, it was towed to the Jiangnan Shipyard for major repairs.</p>
<p>Negotiation Status:</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has compiled the captain's report and the surveyor's findings and sent a letter to the American Dollar Steamship Line stating that the responsibility for this incident lies entirely with the President Van Buren. The losses suffered by the Jianghua, such as all repair costs, are estimated to be 10,000-plus yuan and should be compensated by the Dollar Steamship Line. The shipping department also believes that since the Jianghua was damaged by the American steamer and entered the dock, it should take this opportunity to carry out major repairs to the keel, deck, etc. It is estimated to cost about 25,000 taels of silver and has been reported to Manager Liu Hongsheng for approval.</p>
<p>Provisional Municipal Council Investigates the Use of Rehabilitation Public Bonds.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rehabilitation Public Bonds have been issued in full and the funds have been handed over. During the fifth meeting of the Provisional Municipal Council the other day, this matter was also discussed. Although the issuance of the public bonds occurred before the establishment of the council, since they are used for rehabilitation projects, the methods of use, distribution, expenditure, and auditing are still very important. The meeting resulted in a letter being sent to the municipal government requesting that the details of the issuance of the public bonds and the methods of use, distribution, and auditing be sent to the council for review and deliberation.</p>
<p>Chen Huasong, Director of the Materials Storage and Transfer Office of the Ministry of Communications, Arrives in Shanghai to Take Office.</p>

Now, due to the chaotic affairs of the bureau, Wen has submitted a request to the ministry to resign from the concurrent position, which has been approved. The Ministry of Communications has appointed Chen Huasong to replace him. It is reported that Chen arrived at the office yesterday to take over. Chen graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University and has served as a teaching assistant at the university, chief of the materials warehouse of the Transportation Department of the Nanjing General Headquarters, chief of the general affairs section of the Anhui Official Mining Bureau, radio engineer of the Ministry of Communications, and director of the Zhengzhou Materials Storage and Transfer Office of the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<p>New Japanese Director Appointed to the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Mr. Funatsu Succeeds Mr. Terai.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the afternoon of January 5th, Chairman Bell announced that Japanese Director Mr. Terai had to return to his country for two months or longer due to illness and had resigned from his position as Director. After deliberation, the Board of Directors reluctantly approved his resignation and elected Mr. Funatsu, Director of the China Silk Weaving Industry Association and former Director of the Municipal Council, to succeed him until the end of the Board of Directors' term this year. In addition, Mr. Terai's vacancies on the Finance Committee and the Security Committee were filled by Mr. Okamoto.

<p>Shanghai National Products Company Holds First Exhibition to Kick Off National Products Year.</p>
<p>To Be Held in Two Stages.</p>
<p>Managers Wu Zhihao and Lu Qisheng of the Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, recognizing that the National Products Movement is intensifying along with the patriotic trend, have launched the First Exhibition to kick off the National Products Year. They have put in all their effort and planned it completely, dividing it into two stages. The first stage, from the 5th of this month to the 15th, is the Grand Exhibition of Silk, Wool, Cloth, Leather Goods, and Lace. Everything related to clothing materials is available. Silk fabrics, woolen fabrics, cotton fabrics, and various top-quality fine fur goods, modern lace, and hundreds of thousands of other items are too beautiful to take in at a glance. Those who visit the exhibition can solve all their clothing needs. The second stage, scheduled from the 16th to the 25th, is the Grand Exhibition of Daily Merchandise. All daily necessities are super-selected from the essence of national products and the best products from famous factories, all meticulously displayed. It is said that everything beautiful is available, and nothing beautiful is missing. Those who visit the exhibition can solve all their daily needs problems. According to those who have visited the exhibition, the First Exhibition held by the company not only carries the mission of promoting national products, but also is practical and realistic, preserving a ray of hope for the declining social economy. If industry can be revitalized in the future and national factories can be developed, then the company will be a strong line of resistance against economic aggression from imperialism. There are also two special features that visitors should pay attention to. (1) The exhibition features a variety of top-quality national products, specially selected to give preferential treatment to customers, and they are replaced daily. At the lowest price, you can get the most genuine goods. (2) A Hundred Flowers Mountain is built in the exhibition, so that customers know that the Spring Festival has arrived, and everyone should know to start anew. They should participate in the National Products Year Movement together and strive forward. This is not just a decoration for the New Year.</p>

<p>A Young Woman Beautifully Dressed in the Style of Lidu Shot Suddenly</p>
<p>Accompanied by a Male Relative on Wangzhi Road</p>
<p>Two Thugs Came Out of Nowhere and Opened Fire, the Woman Fell Down Immediately</p>
<p>Is it Wang Lijuan? Is it Zhou Xingxian? Mysterious and Unpredictable</p>
<p>At 11:05 last night, a bizarre shooting occurred on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. The victim was a young woman of marriageable age who has not yet been betrothed. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Last night at 11:05, on Wangzhi Road, very west of Luban Road, at the corner of No. 147, next to the side door of the Red House Hospital, on the pedestrian path, a gunshot suddenly rang out, and a young woman beautifully dressed in the style of Lidu fell to the ground. A man who was accompanying her shouted for help. Nearby Chinese police officers rushed to the scene and saw the woman lying in a pool of blood, with blood gushing from her mouth. The bullet had entered her mouth. The police officers quickly hired a rickshaw and, along with the man, escorted her to the Songshan Road police station. The woman falsely claimed to be Wang Lijuan. When they arrived at the police station, the woman was unconscious. A Chinese detective from Jiangsu, Shanghai, carefully examined her and saw that she was wearing a dark purple velvet cheongsam, scarlet silk stockings, black high-heeled leather shoes, and a black leather coat. She was very beautiful. He then ordered the Chinese police officer No. 587 to take her to Renji Hospital. After about fifteen minutes, the woman woke up slightly. The doctor asked her name, but because of the injury to her mouth, she could not speak. She was given a pencil and wrote "Wang Lijuan, 23 years old, Jiangsu, Shanghai," in twelve characters. After writing, she passed out again.</p>
<p>Her Real Name is Zhou Xingxian:</p>
<p>After the detective took the injured person to the hospital, he questioned the man who was with the woman and lived in the same apartment. The man said that his name was Zhu Yingquan, 28 years old, from Chuansha, who used to be the director of the general affairs department of Jiangwan Labor University, and had previously worked in the Ministry of Communications in Beiping. He lived at No. 1 Hepingli, Xuehuali Road, French Concession. The injured woman's name was Zhou Xingxian, also known as Yiqin, 30 years old, and she was his fellow townsman and relative. Zhou currently lived at No. 504 Pubai Road, Shanghai Women's Apartment affiliated with the Chinese Women's Temperance Association.</p>
<p>The Two Walked Side by Side:</p>
<p>The man continued, "Tonight at 10 PM, Zhou accidentally took the wrong path after dinner and went to my house. Then we went out together to buy a toothbrush and a few other things. When I left the house, I had a large leather briefcase with me, which contained various novels, Shen Bao Monthly, and a petition to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing. Zhou put her toothpaste and toothbrush in my briefcase. The two of us walked side by side, intending to go to Pubai Road via Songshan Road. Unexpectedly, we talked along the way and mistakenly identified the route, and unknowingly we had passed Pubai Road and arrived at Wangzhi Road. At that time, we simply made the most of it and walked straight west along Wangzhi</p>

<p>Educational News　　Proposal for a New Key Education System　　Submitted to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee by the Education Reform Committee　　Guangzhou, 4th Reuters Education Reform Committee has submitted a new school system to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, abolishing winter and summer vacations, shortening the school year, with elementary and middle schools each lasting five years, and universities three years, to replace the current six-six-four system. Regarding teachers, they advocate for increased salaries or the granting of honorary salaries. Professors who have taught for a certain number of years will be granted a certain number of days of leave. After Zheng Zhenwen takes office as the Director of the Fujian Education Department, he will make policy statements and announce staff appointments. Zheng Zhenwen, member of the Fujian Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, arrived in Fujian on the 18th of December aboard the Huaan ship. He was sworn into office at 9:00 AM on the 19th in the auditorium of the Provincial Government, with Chairman Jiang serving as the supervisor. He took office at the Education Department at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and immediately announced the appointments of Gao Jue, Wei Zhang, and Wang Hanchuan as secretaries, Lin Jian as the head of the first section, Zheng Tan as the head of the second section, Tang Shouqian as the head of the third section, He Yunong, Huang Kaisheng, Ye Songpo, Wang Shuxian, and Sun Chenglie as supervisors, and Lin Tingjie as acting supervisor. He also issued the following declaration:</p>
<p>▲Zheng Zhenwen's Views on Education in Fujian</p>
<p>Zhenwen, entrusted with the appointment by the authorities and urged by the elders, returns to his hometown amidst national crisis to oversee education. He has received many inquiries from fellow villagers and journalists regarding his views. Therefore, he records a few words as a response. Zhenwen has been abroad for twenty years, engaged in academic and writing pursuits, originally intending to spend his life in scholarly work and avoid politics. However, since the outbreak of national crisis and the successive incidents in Shanghai, being in the war zone has been particularly stimulating, further emphasizing the duty of every individual, not allowing him to be self-centered. He has personally witnessed the national army bravely resisting the enemy, preserving righteousness for the country, believing that a glimmer of hope for the nation lies therein. Now, with Chairman Jiang and Director Cai coming to Fujian to pacify and organize the provincial government, Zhenwen is fortunate to be part of the supporting staff, feeling an even greater sense of responsibility. Therefore, disregarding his own inadequacy, he temporarily abandons his writing career to take on the educational position. Considering the current situation in Fujian, the southeast is coastal and unexpectedly dangerous, while the northwest is mountainous with ongoing communist suppression. In terms of time, the national crisis is not yet over; in terms of location, defensive measures are necessary. Implementing education according to the times is a crucial plan for national salvation. Zhenwen intends to follow the instructions of the central and provincial authorities, review the strategies of previous administrations, adopt the opinions of experts, further understand the shortcomings of Fujian in normal times, and combine them with the needs of the present. He plans to research and implement step by step, while also achieving practical results. The customs and habits of the people in Fujian differ somewhat from those of other provinces. First, poverty: poverty is a common ailment in China, but in Fujian, where industry is underdeveloped and has been ravaged by bandits and communists, ten houses out of ten are empty, which is even worse than in other provinces. Second, backwardness: Fujian has inconvenient transportation and a closed atmosphere. The general population lacks research. Recent surveys of the sales of various Chinese and foreign books and newspapers show that Fujian often lags behind other provinces. Third, disunity: Languages vary in different parts of Fujian, making it difficult to communicate opinions, leading to the development of individualism and a lack of group cohesion. Fourth, weakness: The physique of Chinese people is generally stronger in the north than in the south, and among the southern provinces, Guangdong and Guangxi are stronger than Fujian. Without a healthy body, it is difficult to have a healthy spirit. Because of this, people in Fujian tend to have weak wills, and can even be blinded by greed, tarnishing the reputation of fellow villagers when they venture out to work. Addressing the above four points, we will prescribe the right medicine: ㈠ Pay attention to productive education to alleviate poverty. Throughout the province, tea and wood are produced in the upstream mountainous areas, rice is produced in the plains, and mineral resources are abundant in Longyan and Jian'ou. The coast has three major fishing grounds. Other special products of Fujian include sugar in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, paper in Shaowu and Tingzhou, lacquerware in Fuzhou, and porcelain in Dehua. If we can adapt to local conditions and enable local students to benefit from their local areas, even small benefits are welcome, but widespread participation is essential. Even minor industries must strive for self-reliance. We will cultivate specialized knowledge to prepare talent for agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining, thus making full use of the land advantages of Fujian, which faces the sea and relies on the mountains. If every family can be self-sufficient, bandits will naturally not arise, and national defense will be strengthened. The implementation method involves first investigating the needs of various regions and establishing various vocational schools, emphasizing practical courses. Even elementary schools will teach productive skills, so that students will not end up learning something that is not useful after graduation and become vagrants. ㈡ Pay attention to scientific education to save the country. Natural science is for exploring the truth of the universe. The educational method should make students pay attention to observation and experimentation, supplemented by new instruments, to stimulate their ability to learn independently. They should be able to organize knowledge and understand things, thereby gradually inspiring the opportunity for invention and advancing the path to practical application. Even elementary school students should use systematic organization, accurate observation, and train a scientific spirit, be able to improve social life, train people who are suitable for the era, and establish a new outlook on life, so that mankind can gradually escape superstition and enter the realm of reason. ㈢ Pay attention to civic training to save education. At this point, Fujian people cannot be allowed to remain like scattered sand. The past is gone; the question is how to gather strength. This lies with the youth. Therefore, schools should be a microcosm of society, students should be groups of villagers, and the people's rights should be incorporated into moral education. We should carry out mutual assistance in our work. Social education should especially emphasize unity and collective action, so that people are of one mind, without any distinction between the provincial capital, the upper reaches, or the lower prefectures, and without the habit of internal strife. We should jointly build enterprises in peacetime and cultivate good citizens for the constitutional era. In times of crisis, we should be united against the enemy and share the same hatred. By doing this, we can save the nation. I hope that my colleagues will work hard to pay attention to physical education to save the weakness of the body, and pay attention to character education to save the weakness of the will. In terms of physical education, we should follow the principles of physiology and hygiene, practice sports, and develop physical strength evenly. Training should be widespread in schools of all sizes, without focusing only on a few people for competitions. There should be constant activity inside and outside the classroom, without being stimulated only by competition at one time. On the one hand, we should implement school training, and on the other hand, we should promote mass sports. As for character education, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace have already been established as moral standards. Educators should especially lead by example and be a good model for students. If students are sincerely convinced and transformed in one school, and have strong physical strength and willpower after their studies, they will not be corrupted by wealth or power, they will not be swayed by poverty or lowliness, and they will not be subdued by force. It is hoped that the moral spirit will still exist in the coastal areas. According to this plan, we will implement it earnestly. As for compulsory education and mass education, we should also promote them as much as possible to achieve perfection. The above is a confidential list, speaking from a theoretical perspective. As for the implementation method, Zhenwen also has a concrete plan. After observing the situation for a few months, he will propose measures, on the one hand concentrating talents from the education sector inside and outside the province, and seeking advice at any time. I hope that my colleagues who are handling education will be pragmatic and work together to achieve results. I especially hope that my elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts will express their opinions and offer timely assistance.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Files the Method for Annual Salary Increases for Elementary School Teachers and Staff</p>

It is hoped that this will be investigated and instructed for notification.</p>

<p>Huang Ruihua and Sun Jinshun Arrive in Shanghai: Youyou's Lineup Renewed, Today's Tactics in Business</p>
<p>▲ At the Baseball Field at 3 PM</p>
<p>▲ Donghua vs. Nokes Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Youyou Football Team, formerly known as the Puyuan Three Education Team that made a splash in Shanghai, has declined in strength since its talent scattered. However, Mr. Cheng Yize, who presides over the association, has always maintained a great spirit and strived for development. Good news has come that Huang Ruihua and Sun Jinshun, the famous football players admired throughout the country, have arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong in the past few days and joined Youyou. Huang Ruihua is a good central defender, and Sun Jinshun is famous for his iron leg. Both have been in battle for a long time and have a distinguished record. Youyou's strength will surely increase greatly. The person in charge of the association declared that several more famous players from Hong Kong may continue to come. If so, Youyou will stand on equal footing with Donghua and Jinan, and the hegemony of Shanghai football will be entirely in the hands of our Chinese people. This is also a surprising piece of news in the football world this year. This afternoon at 3 PM, Youyou will play against the French Concession Businessmen's Association in the Group A league at the baseball field. Huang and Sun will play in the game to show their power. Tomorrow at 3 PM, the Group A league game between Donghua and Rakes will also be held at the baseball field.</p>

<p>Hujiang Wins Over Mailing 46 to 40</p>
<p>Liangjiang Wins Over Southeast 28 to 20</p>
<p>Although this year's New Year's games were not as prosperous as in previous years, the Western YMCA basketball room was sometimes full. The most important game was the Hujiang vs. Mailing Western 甲 Group game. As a result, Hujiang won 46 to 40. In the Western YMCA women's basketball game, Liangjiang lost to Southeast again, with a score of 28 to 20. As for the football game, Donghua's 6-3 victory over the Westerners Association was very interesting, while Jinan lost to Lancashire 2-4 again. From then on, Jinan's hopes in the Western League Group 1 were weakened. The results of various sports competitions during the New Year are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Western League Football Game: Donghua Defeats Westerners Association</p>
<p>丨Result: 6 to 3丨</p>
<p>▲ French Concession Businessmen's Association Wins Over Westerners Association... 4 to 3</p>
<p>▲ Agaier Wins Over Navy... 3 to 1</p>
<p>▲ Lancashire Wins Over Jinan... 4 to 2</p>
<p>Donghua and the Westerners Association met at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the 3rd. Donghua goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan's foot injury did not heal, and his performance was greatly reduced. The Westerners Association reorganized its forces, turning weakness into strength, and giving Donghua fierce competition. Although Donghua won the final victory with 6 to 3, it had exhausted its strength. The performances of both teams were very good. The Westerners Association's forwards Baudhan and Koch were brave and good at fighting, and invincible. Unfortunately, there were many loopholes in the rear, and they could not cooperate with each other, which led to defeat.</p>
<p>▲ Donghua Lineup</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Tu Kaiyuan, Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, Wan Xianghua, Chen Jiaqiu, Li Yichen, Chen Yutian, Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>▲ Westerners Association</p>
<p>Gottekin, Marai Tuo, Faping, Hui Mao, Bo Qis, Xue Fu, Koch, Baudhan, Jin Bo, Mao Lei, Xian Erxun</p>
<p>The game started at 3 o'clock. Donghua's Li Yichen scored the first goal. Donghua's offensive was very strong and missed many opportunities. Later, the Westerners Association's side Lu invaded and Koch scored a goal. After the central kickoff, Donghua went all out, and Chen Jiaqiu scored two goals in a row. Donghua won 3 to 1 in the first half. In the second half, the Westerners Association's lineup suddenly became strict and their momentum was very strong. Koch first scored a 12-yard penalty, and then Bokis scored a long shot, and the score became 3-3. At that time, Donghua was like bad luck was on its head, and it could not attack or retreat. With the loss of two goals, the situation was critical. It reorganized the team and then counterattacked fiercely. The situation suddenly changed again. Chen Jiaqiu first heard Longmen, and Li Yichen scored another goal. Tu Kaiyuan also made a contribution. As a result, Donghua won 6 to 3.</p>
<p>French Concession Businessmen's Association. The Western League Group A match between the French Businessmen's Association and the Westerners Association took place at the racecourse on New Year's Day. Fair-skinned ladies surrounded the venue, and the atmosphere was very lively. The Westerners Association reorganized its forces, turning weakness into strength, and the competition between the two teams was extremely fierce. As a result, the French Concession Businessmen's Association won 4 to 3.</p>
<p>Ah. The game between Agaier and the British Navy was held on the 2nd at the racecourse. The Navy was attended by the Tifeng ship H.M.S. Devvnshire, which had recently arrived in Shanghai to defend. The team was very strong. After arriving in Shanghai, it had defeated the French Concession Businessmen's Association 6 to 3 and Laxes 3 to 1, and was very famous. However, on this day, it lost to Agaier 1 to 3.</p>
<p>Since Chen Zhenhe retired from Jinan, its strength has inevitably decreased slightly. In the Skota Cup replay, Jinan was eliminated by Lancashire with a score of 2 to 3. The two teams met again yesterday (the 6th) at Yiyuan for a Group A match. As a result, Jinan lost again with a score of 2 to 4. Jinan's famous players Xu Yahui, Zhuang Shihong, Liang Shutang, etc. were unable to play due to foot injuries, and their strength was greatly reduced. Qiu Dongyan did not participate in the war because he failed to practice after arriving in Shanghai. Zhong Yongjie, a famous player from Medan who came with Qiu, was said to be a good player on the right wing, but he was appointed as the left forward yesterday and did not perform well.</p>

<p>Western YMCA Men's Basketball: Hujiang Defeats Mailing</p>
<p>46 to 40</p>
<p>Competing with Haizei for Hegemony in 甲 Group</p>
<p>The most important event of the Western YMCA basketball game during the New Year was the Hujiang vs. Mailing game. As a result, Hujiang won 46 to 40. From then on, the Western YMCA 1st Group became a three-way division of the world, one of which has been eliminated. Hujiang and Haizei competed against each other. Who will win the championship? It depends on the decisive battle between the two teams on the 14th of this month. I hope that the athletes of Yangshupu will work hard and be cautious to go to it. As for the battle between Hujiang and Mailing, although Hujiang led all the way and never fell behind, the competitive situation was very tense. The first half was 26 to 14. In the second half, Hujiang's voice rose, and it was still very prosperous. The most different score was 30 to 14. Mailing suffered a big setback and worked hard to develop. Its momentum suddenly became strong and it rose sharply. The score suddenly became 37 to 35. Hujiang only led by two points and was in danger. However, Hujiang calmly did not return, and Xu Tu Hongzhan finally won 46 to 40.</p>

<p>Free Talk   The Wonderful Uses of Boasting  By Ms. Qing</p>
<p>Boasting is a form of megalomania. Moralists may consider it a flaw, but in dealing with the world, it is a wonderfully effective tool. If you lack the ability to boast in this life, not only will you not find a good job, but even rickshaw pullers will look down on you.</p>
<p>Westerners are, after all, close to being idiots. They insist on doing everything practically and diligently. We intelligent Chinese people find such laborious endeavors absolutely laughable. Westerners insist on taking things one step at a time, never looking for shortcuts to success. But we Chinese people specialize in shortcuts, and the first key to taking shortcuts is being good at boasting.</p>
<p>Boasting is an art not to be taken lightly, like "hyperbole" in rhetoric. Li Bai's "The Yellow River's waters come from the sky" and "Three thousand feet of white hair" are examples of "hyperbole" in rhetoric. But to those who don't study rhetoric, it just sounds like Li Bai is boasting.</p>
<p>In fact, boasting is indeed extremely useful to a person. Human beings are strange creatures. No matter what you do, if you honestly tell them the truth, not only will it not resonate with them, but they will also despise and sneer at you. If you meet someone who knows you well, who knows that the rice for your family's breakfast was pawned for bedding, you just need to shamelessly say, "A certain minister is a good friend of my father, a certain politician is my sworn uncle, I know a certain wealthy businessman, and my wife is sworn sisters with the fifth wife of a certain warlord." Once you start blowing this trumpet, those who don't know you will obediently put their palms together and respectfully bow to you. If you're lucky, they might even invite you to a lavish bird's nest banquet!</p>
<p>Because boasting has so many benefits, everyone, regardless of their background, is doing their best to boast. But hold on! You must identify your target when boasting, otherwise, it will be difficult to stir their heartstrings, and you will lose the effectiveness of your boasting. For example, when you meet an unknown writer or student who admires literary figures, and you want to pose as a seasoned elder, you don't need to say anything else. Just say that Hu Shi is a close friend of yours, and Yu Dafu is your best confidant. Even better, subtly inquire about some trivial anecdotes about Hu Shi and Yu Dafu.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Essays on Art and Literature  By Sun Fuxi</h3>
<p>When Mr. Cai Yuanpei first became the head of Peking University, at a faculty meeting, a dean of engineering surnamed He spoke at length, advocating for an emphasis on engineering. At that time, Mr. Lu Xun also said that engineering was very important. After he finished speaking, Mr. He added, "Listen to that! The importance of engineering is not only advocated by those of us who study engineering, but even those who study literature say so. Its importance is clear."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun stood up again and said, "That's very true; however, those who study literature know that engineering is also important, but those who study engineering only know the importance of engineering."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking and sat down, there was a long period of silence. Dean He did not stand up to speak again.</p>
<p>Promoting a particular field is indeed extremely important, but it should not come at the expense of art and literature.</p>
<p>For a country or a nation to prosper and endure, it must have two conditions: First, it must be able to follow the strengths of other countries and nations; second, it must be able to create strengths that other countries and nations do not possess. When we see that others can build machines by hand, we must strive to follow them, but we cannot cut off our own legs first. As for cutting off the mind for thought, art and literature, that is even more nonsensical.</p>
<p>The United States is a country that values economics. They do their best to cultivate engineering talents, hoping for a large output, but they are unwilling to spend much money on higher art education. Their thinking is that cultivating profound artists is too expensive; it is cheaper to hire them from France. However, the United States does not forgo art education altogether, but rather hires French artists to teach. As for literature, they still have departments for research and schools to cultivate profound talents, and they will never abandon art and literature because of a desire for profit.</p>
<p>Examining various colonies, education is mostly focused on instilling knowledge and skills related to production, and the people cannot obtain lessons to increase their artistic and literary thought. Our country, at least in form, is still unwilling to admit that it is a colony, and still claims to be an independent and free country. Yet, there are now many people advocating for the abolition of art and literature, which is not only a bit comical, but also a bit heartbreaking!</p>
<p>For example, if you know what Hu Shi likes to hear most and what Yu Dafu dislikes most, then you can intimately call them "Shi Zhi this and that, Dafu this and that." In this way, you will become an equal to Hu Shi and Yu Dafu and be respected by others.</p>
<p>If you meet a woman who is fond of vanity, you can say that you have traveled the world, been to Turkey and South Africa, and even traveled at your own expense. This will prove that you are not only knowledgeable and experienced but also a member of the bourgeoisie. Then your love affair will immediately succeed.</p>
<p>As for merchants, bureaucrats, politicians, and warlords, you can observe their expressions, cater to their preferences, and boast to them extravagantly. In short, appeal to the lustful with sex, the greedy with profit, the fame-seekers with fame, and the power-hungry with power. This is the so-called method of fighting poison with poison, and it is always effective.</p>
<p>Someone might say that while boasting is useful, you must boast well. Otherwise, you will be exposed, and the performance will be over.</p>
<p>This is certainly true, and boasting also requires considerable training. First, you must not blush. Even if you have never written a single book, you can grit your teeth and say, "My writings are so numerous that they could fill a room, but unfortunately, they were all burned by a wildfire!" If you have just bought a set of dishes because you are inviting a few beautiful guests for dinner, you can say, "I've had these things for ten years," to show that you are not embarrassed by having guests. If you only have one dollar left in your pocket, and a friend invites you to play mahjong, you can say, "My money is all in the bank, and I just don't have time to get it out today!" If your wife feels that you are not very promising one day, you can say that Miss Zhang praised your poems and Mrs. Wang praised your looks as handsome and masculine. In this way, your wife will immediately love you even more.</p>
<p>There are endless examples of boasting, but the key is to understand and apply them wisely! Editorial Department</p>
<p>To the Gentlemen Who Contributed in December...</p>
<p>Due to the extraordinary busyness of the accounting department at the end of the year, payments for manuscripts from December will not be processed until the sixteenth of this month. We apologize for the delay and hope for your understanding. We also ask that you continue to contribute! The Crossroads of Love and Era A Long Story by Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"I have a relative who is a counselor in the Ministry of Finance, surnamed Ren."</p>
<p>"That's right. That's who they're talking about!"</p>
<p>Ms. Zhuo smiled at this moment. Her two rows of neat, white teeth looked even more attractive and charming under the electric light. He thought that if she allowed him to take direct action, he would definitely stick his tongue out and lick each one of them until he was satisfied.</p>
<p>"What kind of relative? Are you close to him?"</p>
<p>Haiquan really didn't want to tell Zhuo Shuhua about his relationship with Ren, the Master of Arts. If he didn't have a considerable relationship with Liu Peizhu, he wouldn't even want to visit the Ren mansion. Originally, he and Ren, the Master of Arts, were strangers to each other, with no connection whatsoever. If he and Ren were considered relatives, then after two more twists and turns, he would also have some distant relationship with the black mud crab.</p>
<p>"There is a somewhat indirect relationship. I don't have any deep friendship with him."</p>
<p>No matter what, Haiquan wouldn't tell her that Ren, the Master of Arts, was his sister's husband's brother-in-law. Because that was such an awkward term!</p>
<p>"So, you don't see him often?"</p>
<p>Disappointment was written on Zhuo Shuhua's half-red, half-pale face.</p>
<p>"You can see him by going to his house."</p>
<p>He answered casually.</p>
<p>"Do you often go to his house?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>As he answered, he paid close attention to Zhuo Shuhua's attitude. She didn't have the same enthusiasm as before.</p>
<p>There was another period of silence between them. They could only hear the noisy voices of people downstairs, and at the same time, they could hear the music of a gramophone record nearby—the most popular boatman's song recently. Ms. Zhuo also emitted her soft soprano voice, harmonizing with the singing. Haiquan listened and felt infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>(Fifteen)</p>
<p>Zhuo Shuhua's mother walked in. Haiquan looked at her. She was about fifty years old, and her face seemed to be covered with a lot of snow cream. She was short and fat, wearing a black wrinkled silk cheongsam with white lambskin trim. Her old-fashioned appearance slightly aroused Haiquan's aversion.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, this is my mother."</p>
<p>Haiquan stood up slightly and nodded to Mother Zhuo.</p>
<p>"Please sit down, don't be polite."</p>
<p>Mother Zhuo spoke in a pure Cantonese accent.</p>
<p>As they were exchanging greetings, a pale-faced young man walked in. He bowed very respectfully to Haiquan.</p>
<p>"Is this Mr. Lin?"</p>
<p>He asked Shuhua with a smile. Haiquan looked at him and felt that other than being short in stature, the two siblings had no resemblance whatsoever.</p>
<p>There were exactly four people, each occupying one side of the square table. At this time, the nanny brought up a plate of bananas and a plate of oranges.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, my daughter is in school. I hope you will give her a lot of guidance."</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Reflections on the Year 1932 By Jinmen</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow. Suddenly, it's 1933 again. Recalling everything from the past, one can't help but feel a sense of lament!</p>
<p>The Northeast has been lost for over a year, and not an inch of land has been recovered. The government loudly proclaims long-term resistance to recover the lost territories, but it has become empty talk on paper. Everyone talks about unity and cooperation against external enemies, but each continues to dream their own dreams.</p>
<p>The people loudly call for economic boycott, but Japanese goods still flood the market. Opportunistic merchants have made a fortune. What associations, what groups—they don't care about any of that.</p>
<p>The War Abolition Alliance has wasted the efforts of a group of famous figures. The two Chens in Guangdong, Han Fuqu and Liu Zhennian in Shandong, and the uncle and nephew in Sichuan are fighting even more fiercely than during the "January 28th Incident." What can the War Abolition Alliance do about them?</p>
<p>Regarding the Northeast Incident, the people rely on the government, and the government relies on the League of Nations. The League of Nations has never dared to offend powerful Japan. Continuing to delay in this way, who knows in what year of the Republic the Northeast will be restored to the map of the Republic of China?</p>
<p>Only the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia has changed the international front, startling Japan. Newspapers and public opinion have unanimously supported it, and even unscrupulous merchants are happy because they can abandon Japanese goods and specialize in selling Russian goods, becoming patriotic comrades. This can be considered the most popular diplomatic achievement since the "September 18th Incident."</p>
<p>Apart from this, there are no other deeply popular political achievements to be found. On the contrary, there are bad things... "Establishment of the Puppet State," "Defeat of the Soviet-Horse," "The Righteous Army is about to be Eliminated by Japan," "Critical Situation in Rehe," "Peiping and Tianjin..."</p>
<p>Alas! My heart aches, and my hand trembles. I can't bring myself to write anymore. Artificial Gasoline Made by Science By Zutong</p>
<p>The amount of gasoline needed by the world's many motorcycles, motorboats, motor machines, etc., is, of course, astounding and frightening. Therefore, the supply of natural gasoline is greatly insufficient to meet the demand. Moreover, the amount of it buried in the ground is limited. If we continue to extract it for a long time, there will definitely be a day when it runs out. Therefore, in recent years, chemists have worked hard to study it and have achieved good results. Since our country has not yet discovered many oil deposits, we should make timely efforts in the artificial gasoline industry.</p>
<p>If we want to talk about artificial gasoline, we must first know what natural gasoline is. Natural gasoline is a liquid distilled at a certain boiling point from crude oil (Erdol), also known as kerosene, which is buried in the ground. It is a saturated hydrocarbon compound with a boiling point between 70 and 90 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>There are two relatively economical possibilities in theory and in practice for making artificial gasoline:</p>
<p>1. From saturated hydrocarbon compounds with high boiling points, transform them into gasoline. This is called the "cracking process" (Knacksenprozess). This involves applying high temperatures (500 degrees Celsius) and high hydrogen pressure (12 atmospheres) in a closed container to saturated hydrocarbon compounds with high boiling points to break them down, such as dividing C16 into two C8. However, this method can only be used to break down high-boiling-point crude oil. When crude oil runs out, gasoline will also run out, so this is not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>2. We already know that gasoline is a saturated hydrocarbon compound with a low boiling point. Carbon and hydrogen are not easily depleted. However, to synthesize carbon and hydrogen into hydrocarbon compounds, catalysts, high temperatures, and high pressures should be applied. This synthesis method is called "synthesis," because it is synthesized from two elements. There are also direct synthesis and indirect synthesis...</p>
<p>A. Direct Synthesis by Combining Carbon and Hydrogen Elements with High Pressure and High Temperature: Applying relatively high pressure and a temperature of 450 degrees to the two elements will cause them to synthesize into hydrocarbon compounds. This method was invented by Mr. Bergins. He established a special factory in Rheinanmamnheim to manufacture artificial gasoline, called BerginWerk. According to Mr. Bergins's report, manufacturing gasoline using this method costs about 175 marks per ton, which is equivalent to 90 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>B. Indirect Synthesis by Adding Catalysts to Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide: If we want to manufacture hydrocarbon compounds from hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the simplest way to obtain the required gases is to pass steam over red-hot coke, with the following reaction: C + H2O → CO + H2. Apply catalysts, high temperatures, and high pressures to the resulting hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and a chemical reaction will occur, forming carbon oxide compounds and compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. For example, at 100 atmospheres and 400 degrees, using a certain catalyst, pure methanol (CH3OH) can be obtained. This methanol produced by the synthesis method has already been sold on the market. If other temperatures, pressures, and catalysts are used, then the chemical equilibrium will shift towards the hydrocarbon compound direction, turning it into gasoline.</p>
<p>Mr. F. Fischer's method initially also used high pressure, but his contact was different. As a result, he obtained a mixed liquid containing various alcohols and other various hydrocarbon oxide compounds, called Synthol. Heating Synthol at 100 degrees yields Synthol, which can directly replace gasoline. Recently, Mr. Fischer's method has progressed. He uses a mixture of chromium oxide and lead oxide as a catalyst to manufacture hydrocarbon compounds under simpler equipment, normal pressure, and conditions of 200 to 300 degrees, obtaining gasoline in addition to gas (mostly worthless marsh gas). This artificial gasoline does not require processing and refining and can be used directly. Its density is 0.6718. A New Year's Day Ode for Literary Art in 1933 By Chen Zhu</p>
<p>Twice yearly amid national crisis, how dare we celebrate the New Year?</p>
<p>Looking at the Party and State, there are many heroes and elites, opening the Third Plenary and the Fourth Plenary.</p>
<p>Prolonged resistance, the words are not empty, waiting until the sea dries up after a thousand years.</p>
<p>I fear that the beanstalks will be exhausted on the same day, and it will be difficult to see the ruins after the Pengdao robbery.</p>
<p>Great marshals return, lined up to welcome, the cannons roar on the riverbank like thunder.</p>
<p>How is it that on National Day and New Year's, the people are not allowed to celebrate? (Newspaper reported that the government issued an order to stop celebrations)</p>
<p>Victory and defeat are common in military affairs, and the national spirit of revival must be uplifted.</p>
<p>Who teaches the people to be like homeless dogs, their heroic hearts for saving the country gradually waning? A Dream By Yi Ping</p>
<p>The wind blows over the roof, and the distant revelry cannot penetrate here. This is a dilapidated hut. Besides her two cute and innocent grandchildren, the hut is Old Granny Sun's only property. Tomorrow is the first day of the Lunar New Year. Two large red New Year's Eve candles are lit on the low</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>table in front of the bed. The flickering red light can illuminate most of the room. At this time, Old Granny Sun is sitting in front of the bed. Every year, she sits and waits for the first morning of the new year to come, listening for the first sound of cawing to divine the fortune of the coming year. Two children are leaning against her lap, unwilling to sleep, asking their grandmother when they can wear their new clothes. Old Granny Sun has no choice but to coax them, taking off their clothes while saying, "Sleep well and tell Grandma what dreams you have tonight, and we'll eat fried New Year's cake tomorrow morning!" Old Granny Sun saw that this year was getting worse and worse and wanted to use the dreams of innocent children to divine the fortune of the coming year. The children fell asleep soundly after hearing that they would have fried New Year's cake to eat.</p>
<p>Old Granny Sun waited drowsily, waiting, as if she heard the sound of distant firecrackers. A sliver of light indeed shone in through the window frame, and at the same time, two sounds of "caw, caw" were heard, clearly the call of magpies, entering her ears. Instantly, a satisfied smile appeared on her wrinkled face. Old Granny Sun seemed very confident that hearing magpies caw was undoubtedly a good omen for the year.</p>
<p>The two grandchildren also woke up at the same time. They opened their eyes and both shouted, "Grandma, I had a dream!" and both sat up, wanting to speak first. Grandma helped them put on their clothes. "Guo'er, let your older brother speak first. Everyone will have New Year's cake to eat," she said.</p>
<p>"Grandma, it seemed like in the middle of the night," Hua'er said, "gunshots came from outside, and my younger brother was so scared that he started crying. Many people were pounding on the door, and it turned out that the robbers from last year came to rob again..."</p>
<p>"Grandma, I had the same dream," the younger brother said, jumping up and down happily at the same time.</p>
<p>"Don't make a sound. Wait for your older brother to finish speaking."</p>
<p>"The robbers came," Hua'er thought for a moment and continued, "before long, the door was broken open, and a dozen short, evil people rushed in. They were all holding shiny knives and tied up Grandma first..."</p>
<p>"Yes, and brother took a pistol from the side of the bed..." Guo'er couldn't help but blurt out.</p>
<p>"Hua'er, is that so?" Grandma obviously found it strange that the two grandchildren had the same dream.</p>
<p>"Yes, Grandma, I took a pistol from the side of the bed and killed the two robbers who were leading the way. At this time, my younger brother also picked up a thick wooden stick from beside the door and drove the rest of the robbers out..."</p>
<p>"Guo'er, you didn't cry?" Old Granny Sun caressed the two children, taking their dreams as real and forgetting herself in asking...</p>
<p>"Grandma, I didn't cry when I saw my brother take out the pistol. I quickly picked up the wooden stick beside the door and started hitting the robbers wildly."</p>
<p>"What happened afterward?" Grandma listened like it was an interesting story.</p>
<p>Guo'er looked at his brother, and Hua'er also looked at his younger brother, as if asking what happened after they finished beating the robbers.</p>
<p>"I forgot that this was a dream." Grandma realized that they were talking about a dream when she saw that neither child had anything to say. "If you had dealt with them like this when the robbers came last year, our beautiful house in the Northeast wouldn't have been taken away. From today on, you can't always fight over a piece of candy. The two of you should dare to be like you were in the dream, taking up pistols and wooden sticks to take back our house in the Northeast. There are lots of candies inside!...</p>
<p>"Grandma, we want to eat... New Year's cake...!" the brothers said in unison.</p>
<p>"I forgot, I'll go make it. After you've eaten your fill of New Year's cake, you can go and beat the robbers and take back our house in the Northeast," Grandma said, going to the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Brother, bring your pistol, let's go beat the robbers after we eat New Year's cake!" A small fist was thrust into the air. Two caws of "caw, caw" sounded, and a magpie flew past the window. The New Year Has Come By Gu</p>

<p>A certain country woman was going on a long journey for the first time. She arrived at the station and asked a porter, "Hey! Sir, do you know what time the 12 o'clock train leaves?" The porter answered with a strange look, "You're asking about the 12 o'clock train? It leaves at 12 o'clock!"</p>

<p>One day, a teacher was lecturing on science in the classroom, specifically about "phosphorus." To make it clear to the students, he asked a student to go to the storage room to get the bottle of "phosphorus" for a practical experiment. Unexpectedly, the student arrived at the storage room and saw a slip of paper pasted on the bottle containing the "phosphorus," which read "Do not touch!" So he returned to the classroom empty-handed. When the teacher saw that he had not brought the bottle of "phosphorus," he asked him strangely, "Huh? Why didn't you bring the bottle of "phosphorus"?" He replied, "I saw a slip of paper pasted on the bottle that said "Do not touch," so I didn't bring it." Market News</p>
<p>▲ Shenxin Dyeing Factory, located at the intersection of Kade Road and Xinzha Road, was founded by Yu Binggang and others, giants in the dye industry. They have conducted extensive research on bleaching and dyeing various silks and fabrics, and are from A Sympathizer with Small Talk (Continuation 11) by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Wang blushed and took the things. She lowered her head and said, "Thank you so much." Although her eyes could not see what was inside the handkerchief, her nose had already smelled a cosmetic fragrance. This was something she had repeatedly dreamed of but could not get, but now she actually had it. Feeling satisfied, she couldn't help but smile at Meng Guobao again. He knew that Wang Laoer was at home, so it was inconvenient to talk to someone else's wife too much. He just smiled and immediately walked to the door frame and shouted inside, "Is Laoer at home?" Wang Laoer greeted him. His walking seemed to be more disciplined, and he quietly walked closer, nodding to him and saying, "Master Dongjia is here. She said she would invite you over in a while, but you came instead. Please come in and sit." Meng Guobao walked in and had already seen the Dongjia. He was about fifty years old, with a thick black beard on his mouth. His pointed face had sagging muscles, showing his seriousness. He was wearing a white cloth jacket and pants, without any traces of yellow dirt. Even his white cloth socks and double-beam shoes were free of dust. A section of blue cotton trousers strap hung down from the bottom of his jacket. A spectacle case with a green tassel was hung on the buttons of his jacket, and he held a foot-long white paper folding fan in his hand, sitting idly on a bench. When he saw someone coming, he quickly stood up. Wang Laoer said that he was a college student who had returned from the provincial capital. The Dongjia's face seemed to show a hint of surprise, and he immediately clasped his hands with the fan and said, "I have long admired you." On the side, there was another farmer who brought a load of bamboo baskets. He placed a wide, flat carrying pole on the bamboo baskets and used it as a bench. Wang Laoer and Meng Guobao poured a cup of tea and let him sit by the small table. After chatting for a few words, the Dongjia began to talk about renting rice paddies, saying to Meng Guobao, "Mr. Meng, your family also collects rent, so you naturally know the hardships of collecting rent. In recent years, in addition to paying taxes and grain in advance, there are also various surcharges, such as adding one donation, and apportioning seven percent public bonds and six percent public bonds. A lot of money is spent in a year. Originally, according to the current land price, collecting rent is only about four or five percent interest. After deducting those expenses, the rent collector simply has a white year. Now, land bought for a thousand yuan can only collect fourteen or fifteen dan of rent rice. Even if the rice is worth five yuan per dan, it's only worth sixty or seventy yuan. If we were to take the money to lend, people would mortgage the red contract as a blank contract and still have to pay two percent interest per annum. Calculating on a thousand yuan, that would be two hundred yuan per year. The farmers only say that they put in the labor to cultivate the land, and they don't think about the landlord." Meng Guobao smiled and said, "Since that's the case, why don't the landlords sell their land and lend money?" The Dongjia said, "Everyone can figure out this plan, but lending money is always floating wealth, while buying land lays a foundation for ten thousand years." Meng Guobao smiled and said, "That's because the landlords are willing to only collect four or five percent interest, so it's no wonder the tenants." The Dongjia thought, what does this young man mean? He's actually helping the tenants. So he opened the fan and waved it in front of his chest.</p>
<h3>Statement from the Japanese Government to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Falsely Accusing Our Side of Provoking First</p>
<p>Attempting to Confuse World Opinion</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese statement regarding the Yuyu Incident has been sent here from Paris today. The gist is as follows: The Japanese authorities in Beiping had advised Zhang Xueliang to halt the movement of troops towards "Manchukuo," knowing that the security of "Manchukuo" was being threatened. However, the advice was ineffective. During this tense and unsettled time, an unfortunate incident occurred at Yuguan, where Chinese soldiers threw bombs at the Japanese gendarmerie station. Simultaneously, other Chinese soldiers also fired shots at the residence of the Japanese gendarmerie commander. Furthermore, bombs were also thrown into the barracks of the "Manchukuo" border defense troops. Considering the urgent nature of the situation, the Japanese authorities immediately began negotiations with the Chinese civilian and military authorities, hoping to resolve the matter peacefully so that the Japanese residents within the Japanese military camp area could be safe. An agreement was reached the next day, stipulating that Japanese soldiers would patrol the Nanguan area to protect Japanese residents and the railway. A unit of Japanese soldiers was then dispatched to Nanguan, but they were attacked with rifles and bombs by Chinese soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two Japanese officers and two soldiers. As a result, the Japanese troops were forced to return fire, and on January 3rd, at around 2:00 PM, they occupied Yuguan. Looking at the above, it is clear that the Yuguan incident was due to Chinese provocation, deliberately intended to undermine Japan's international standing. This is related to the Chinese plan to invade Rehe (Jehol). As for the Rehe invasion incident, a statement of censure has already been submitted. Please distribute this document to all member states of the League of Nations to avoid being misled by inaccurate information coming from the Far East. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation to the League of Nations declared to the League that the Shanhaiguan incident should be considered a purely local issue and would absolutely not lead to military action against mainland China. The Japanese commander has already begun consultations with General He Zhuguo in order to quickly reach a resolution. The Japanese delegation also said that the area near Yuguan (Shanhaiguan), is currently calm, and the Tokyo government is extremely keen to prevent the situation from becoming serious due to this incident. The Japanese military authorities have taken necessary measures in accordance with this intention. This incident originated from a conspiracy by General Zhang Xueliang, as the southern military commanders all criticized Zhang for being weak. Therefore, Zhang adopted an attitude of opposition to "Manchukuo" and Japan to enhance his own importance. On the other hand, Zhang's actions were beneficial cooperation with the Nanjing government to attract the attention of the League of Nations. The Japanese delegation also stated that Zhang Xueliang's recent large-scale plan to invade Rehe province was seen by the "Manchukuo" government as detrimental to peace and order in the area and harmful to the security of "Manchukuo." If Zhang Xueliang's plan can be defeated after the Shanhaiguan incident, "Manchukuo" and Japan will be extremely pleased. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the Japanese delegation in Geneva, Mr. Sawada, telegraphed the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Drummond, stating that he had received a telegram from the Japanese government declaring that Japan intends to make every effort to treat the Yuyu Incident as a local incident, and will not take any actions that would aggravate the situation unless provoked by the Chinese side. The necessary instructions have now been telegraphed to the local Japanese authorities. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Russian Newspapers Unanimously Criticize</p>
<p>(Moscow) Since the news of the Japanese troops advancing into Rehe arrived, followed by reports of the Japanese troops occupying Suifenhe, newspapers throughout the Soviet Union have been unanimously criticizing the movements of the Japanese warlords. Only the government gazette, Izvestia, still maintains its usual calm and hopeful attitude, but pays close attention to the reactions from the United States. The newspaper deeply feels that the continued Japanese offensive is significantly increasing the tension between Tokyo and Washington. However, Washington's plans are not about to change immediately, as Washington still hopes that Japan can quickly overcome its financial difficulties and order its military to halt its military operations. This is Washington's only policy. If Washington adopts any other policy, it will inevitably lead to a break with both Britain and France. Izvestia concluded by saying that even from the perspective of the United States' efforts to maintain coordination between Europe and the United States, there are many conflicts of interest, and the opinions among the imperialist countries are deepening day by day, so a war is ultimately unavoidable. (4th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The United States Remains Tight-Lipped</h3>
<p>(Washington) Although some American officials have heard various denials and explanations issued by Tokyo, they still believe that Japan's future actions will advance towards the Tianjin and Beiping areas. These people, like Secretary of State Stimson, remain tight-lipped about the Japanese occupation of Yuguan, and are unwilling to make official comments. However, today they no longer hide their anxiety. According to what is heard here, the foreign ministries of European countries are also very concerned about the situation. According to several officials here, because Japan has never clarified how far its incursion into China will go, the statements made by its spokespersons in Geneva are only adding to the anxiety. The claim that Japan has no intention of expanding military operations to mainland China cannot be regarded as a firm statement of its policy. Currently, the greatest fear of American officials is that if Japan moves towards Tianjin and Beiping, the foreign troops stationed along the Beining Railway will be dragged into the vortex. This is because these people believe that Japan has long decided to occupy the Beiping area in order to cut off the supply of the Manchurian volunteer army. However, they are unwilling to explicitly state whether this opinion is based on information from the American military observers in North China. The US State Department has now clearly stated that it will not issue a statement on the Shanhaiguan incident. Although it is obviously as anxious about the situation as the European countries, it is still unwilling to publicly admit it. It is also heard that the US government has instructed US military personnel stationed in China to be extremely cautious and not to be involved in any entanglement. (4th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US State Department today still remains silent on the Yuguan incident. Stimson and the State Department staff, as well as the members of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, are still continuing to study the Philippine independence proposal and will submit their opinions tomorrow or Monday, so that the President can approve or reject them on Tuesday. (4th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Express Anxiety</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's editorial today, titled "The League of Nations and Japan," stated that the Yuguan conflict is not only regrettable, but also bound to increase the anxiety of the British authorities and political circles regarding the outcome of the Manchurian dispute. It would be very sad if the Committee of Nineteen were to cease seeking a way to reconcile the views of China and Japan on the future of Manchuria because of this war. The newspaper does not agree with those who advocate that the League of Nations take active action against Japan, saying that if Japan leaves the League of Nations, it will be even less restrained, and the threat of invading Beiping may become a reality. The newspaper also said that Japan is a pillar of defense against communism in the Far East, and Britain will not make things difficult for its old ally under any circumstances. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British public opinion is not very enthusiastic about taking a clear stance on the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated, "Whether the League of Nations can complete its mission will be proven this month by the Manchurian and Persian incidents. Even in Europe, people have noticed certain signs that difficulties will inevitably arise within a certain period of time. Peace in Europe is not really secure, so the European continent needs the League of Nations very much to avoid the outbreak of conflict. It is a mistake that the world ignores Asian events, considering that Asia is far away and not worthy of attention. It is indeed true that if the League of Nations fails to resolve disputes in Asia, its actions in Europe will inevitably be weakened as a result." (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Clearly Side with Japan</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Times, in its commentary on the new developments in the Far East conflict, acknowledged Japan's sovereignty but also expressed doubts about the effectiveness and necessity of Japan's military actions. The newspaper declared that Japan's invasion of Rehe is due to the fact that the European countries are currently preoccupied with their own affairs, Russia's military strength is insufficient, China is plagued by internal strife and cannot extricate itself, and the United States is in the transitional period between the old and new governments. Therefore, Japan deeply feels that there is no country in the world that can prevent the realization of its continental ambitions. Japan, tempted by this, disregards everything and seeks to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, what is regrettable is that, under the current state of international change, there is still a large gap between principles and reality. (4th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin newspapers are now paying considerable attention to the recent developments in the Far East. The Social Democratic Party organ Vorwärts said that a new war of plunder has now begun with Japan's incursion into North China. The Vossische Zeitung said that, given past events and the Lytton Report, we must accept the Japanese explanations with a skeptical attitude. What is undoubtedly certain is that the political war in East Asia is developing and that European politics will be deeply affected by it. The Posen Zeitung said that French and Czech arms factories are still manufacturing arms and ammunition for both China and Japan. The Tagliche Rundschau said that the Yuguan incident is a terrible blow to China and the League of Nations. The League of Nations will await Nanjing's inevitable protests with mixed emotions. It is thought that the League of Nations and the United States will be able to understand from this recent military action that the Japanese only act according to their necessary interests and do not pay the slightest attention to the resolutions of Geneva.
