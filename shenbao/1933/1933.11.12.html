<p>— 明</p>
<p>新疆自外長羅文幹氏赴新之後。内部問題似已告一段落。外交亦漸趨於和緩。雖問題尙未解决。而就表面觀察。一時當不致再行擴大矣。惟吾儕細考其内容。固不如樂觀論者所云之易於解决。亦不似悲觀論者之全無辦法。蓋中國從前之治理邊疆。秦持放任主義。無所謂具體計劃。在中央僅以覊縻爲政策。要其服從而已足。在邊疆區域。則以爲天高皇帝遠。事事專擅。幾等於土皇帝之自尊。西藏如是。蒙古如是。即新疆雖改省。而亦復如是。新省自楊增新倒金樹仁逃後。政治上弱點遂盡情暴露變化乃生。而宗敎上之爭持。亦愈劇烈。盛劉諸人在新疆之歷史。尙未深遠。僅憑藉漢人之擁護。外來之兵力。丨如蘇馬舊部丨以支撑其目前局面。似已不易。至於政治上之如何設施。經濟上之如何建樹。宗敎隔閡之如何溝通恐此時尙談不到有若何凖備。故新疆馬仲英部猶得乘此時機。繼續紛擾而不已也。</p>
<p>中央旣已兩度派遣大員赴新對新省内部糾紛之核心與夫外交癥結之所在自有更進一步之認識惟對新疆具體辦法未分佈之前。吾人不妨借芻蕘之言。以供國民之研究。而促當局之注意。第一。現在新疆當局。對於政治。上之設施。若仍如暢金一流之所爲。則仍不足以饜新民之希望。何能轉換目下之糾紛且天山北路。原爲國防之重心。而又爲貧瘠區域。苟無確實辦法。一新從前頽廢之局。竊恐離異之民難趨一致故今後之施政。須以一定方針。就地方需要。逐漸進展。例如敎育普及。在今日之新疆。最爲切要。然新疆回民。則多數不願進學校甚有搗毁學校之舉。此類成見。如不設法消弭。則終爲政治上之阻力。宗敎之隔閡將更難掃除也。第二。新疆天然産物。藴藏豐富。一則以交通阻滯。不易開發。一則以農民經濟。甫經轉變。突遇政治上之變局。錮習更難於革除。故今日而言開發。第一須扶助農業經濟之發展。第二須使牧畜經營近代化。第三發展交通第四開發鑛産。否則失去經濟上依據。一切措施。更將無從着手。</p>
<p>農業經營之應改良。我國今日固不僅新省一區爲然。全國各地。亦莫不迫切需要。不過新疆土質。不如遼吉黑三省之肥厚。而地廣人稀則又過之。是集約農業之經營。在内地人稠地狹之區不能實現者。在新疆則頗易着手也。至牧畜經營。無論培養牲畜。或剪毛製革。均須先由政府爲模範之經營。以使民間取法。再進而從事於織毛製革工業。則輕工業之前途。殊多利賴。交通問題。</p>
<p>現在西路航空線。旣已開通往來似甚方便。惟此種方便範圍。在政治上國防上。洵有莫大價値。但與一般社會經濟之補益。則甚細微。蓋以新疆落後之經濟力。其能乘坐飛機者有幾。哈密西瓜與羊毛皮革等笨重貨品。尤不能以飛機載運、彰彰明甚。是以欲圖新省之開發。須從事於鐵道之發展。乃能任重致遠費用雖多收效則甚宏大。汽車路之修築。固較飛機爲有益。然亦僅能利軍用。於整個國民經濟。惠益亦少。蓋以我國旣不能制造汽車。又不出産汽油。且汽車復不能勝重載。我國素産煤鐵。今乃摒自已之煤炭而用外來之汽油。在本國國民經濟之發展。亦不合算。故完成隴海路。伸長至於迪化。由迪化再展至南北疆。實爲新省交通政策最急要之圖新疆鑛藏首推石油。金玉次之。然石油礦之開採。必須巨大資本。設在此鐵路交通未充分運用之前。欲開採油礦恐亦難免爲空談耳。</p>
<p>總之。收拾新疆之難局。開發巨大之富源。必先更新政治。化除漢回之爭。解除内在之一切矛盾。然後廣漠之土地。不至再蹈東北之覆轍也。</p>

<p>新新社記者、近因紗布交易所停市後、旋已照常營業、特往訪棉業統制委員會當道、叩以該會穩定紗價眞相、當由負責人詳告云、本會奉命統制棉業、成立以來、對於治本治標辦法、均經愼重討論、方始次第實施、最近鑒於紗銷呆滯、爲廠商最大痛苦、亟應予以調節、兩旬以來、持平處理、無非爲維持紗業、及顧全大多數人民利益起見、外聞捕風捉影之詞、實不足信、兹將經過詳細情形、發表如左、</p>
<h3 id="c117">穩定棉紗價格起因 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>本會於成立之始、接到財政部公函略云、據稅務署呈稱、前據華商紗廠聯合會、以近來紗廠營業衰落、其重要原因、係因紗布交易所存紗太多、紗價暴跌所致、擬請政府出資、將交易所存紗收買三萬包、庶可將紗價略爲提高、藉維紗業等情、查邇來紗價疲跌、確係事實、如果不設法救濟、誠恐愈跌愈下、影響國内唯一重要企業愈甚、兹値貴委員會組織成立、相應函轉貴會、希即查明紗價跌落實在原因、在可能範圍内、從速核議救濟辦法、以維纱業、至紉公誼、本會接函後、經常務委員會議、討論多次、僉認紗價跌落原因、雖不止一端、而交易所存積巨量棉紗、實爲癥結所在、遂經議决、由本會敦促廠商組織公司、將此項存紗、儘量收買、分運各地推銷、爲釜底抽　之計、此爲本會疏通存紗之辦法、</p>
<h3 id="c118">組織公司銀行墊欵 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>關於收買存紗、須有相當之公司、本會於是邀同熱心廠商、捉成合興公司之組織、以爲收買此項存紗機關、蓋本會深知此項積紗、品質低次、必須减價、方能推銷、將來必有相當損失、本會已函請政府、予以補助、藉冕賠累、計自上月中旬起、陸續收買、至上月底止、合興公司方面、共收進紗二萬一千一百五十件、上月月終、交割清楚、凈價需欵四百零七萬三千零六十七元、由本會商請中國·上海商業儲蓄·大陸·浙江興業·國貨·女子·等六銀行、曁永豐·恒巽·福源·等三錢莊、分認墊付、</p>

<p>吾國交易所收受棉紗、向以商標爲標凖、而不依品質作標凖、廠商因此得以利用機會、專製低次品質棉紗、交入交易所、更予投機者以壓賣機會、本會經屢次討論决定辦法如下、（一）通知紗廠聯合會、轉知各廠、切實尊守該會七月八日决議、自該日起至本年年底止、不再以棉紗入交易所之議案、（二）函知紗布交易所、自十月份起、所有交割棉紗、應由本便派員會同檢騐品質、以杜次紗入交易所之門、（三）會同交易所、改訂棉標凖、及檢騐章程、俾有遵循、</p>

<p>此次合興公司所收棉紗、除大部分爲該所倉庫積紗外、發見有七千二百件、係賣方新交入之貨、實與紗廠聯合會七月八日議决案不符、本會鑒於該會議决案、旣未能執行、殊失信守、又以訂之新標凖、須六個月後、方能實行、而現存標凖紗成色低次、其有效期間、僅二月、因由實業部轉飭交易所、自本年十一月份起至十二月底止、拒絶收受新交入之棉紗、交易所奉令後當即公佈實施、乃經紀人方面、發生顧慮、停止拍板、交易所不得已宣佈自本月六日起、停止交易三天、</p>

<p>本會對於交易所經紀人此種舉動、認爲實因不明實部及本會意旨所致、蓋合興公司收貨目的、旣在穩定紗價、故所收棉紗、以運銷各埠爲尾閭、即如市價上漲過甚、在合興公司所收存貨未銷罄前、仍可由本會令其酌量放出、以資調節、本會爲愛護交易所事業起見、對於該所各項整頓、極願切實恊助、今該所亦已明瞭此旨、並已恢復棉紗交易、價格亦復平穩、本會極表滿意、總之、實業部與本會、同爲穩定棉紗市價起見、一切設施、全爲救濟棉業之危局、實於紗市有益無損、明達之士、當能共見者也、</p>

<p>嚴重意義　今日本市各界舉行剿匪宣傳週、愚忝長本市、謹以「剿匪工作與上海市之繁榮」一題、以說明剿匪工作之嚴重意義、俾我全市民衆、均能深識今日中國匪禍之慘烈、一致奮起、擁護此嚴重艱鉅之工作、共殲此殘民禍國之匪患、</p>
<p>燒殺政策　自中國共産黨以所謂「八七」會議、（十六年八月七日緊急會議）决議其「燒殺政策」以後匪區人民、輾轉於赤匪淫威之下、呻吟民於水深火熱之中者、垂六年矣、除少數安居都市、養尊處優、隔岸觀火之文人學士、尙嚼筆吮毫、高談闊論、非議剿匪外、凡稍具血心、稍負責任國民、殆莫不深痛疾惡於匪患之慘烈、切望赤禍之早日殲滅、</p>
<p>亘古未有　前據蔣委員長通電、豫皖鄂三省匪區、皆如窮邊之地、百物蕩盡、一望荒凉、無不焚之屋、無不伐之木、無遺留之鷄犬、無不殺之耕牛、但聞野哭、不見炊烟、甚或成千累萬、泥首軍前、鵠面鳩形、僵臥道左、爲狀之慘、亘古未有、復據豫鄂皖邊區剿匪總司令部調查匪區統計、僅一人口三十五萬之商城縣、淪陷匪區、亦僅全縣面積五之二、爲被殺者達萬人、流亡者十萬七千人、合流亡與被殺之人口、至佔人口總額之半、焚燬房屋三十四萬三千間、損失牲畜十五萬頭、犧牲財物可一千萬元、而田園之荒蕪者、達全縣面積十之六以上、以商城一縣之統計、其損失已如是之驚人、若合全部匪區而統計之、則其於民族國家、社會經濟之損失之禍害、更何可勝計、此禍不除、此患不滅、國何以立、民何以存、</p>
<p>患在腹心　稽考史乘、窮究理亂、自來兇荒以後、必繼大亂、當此匪禍汜濫、災害並至、險象環生之際、凡我國人、苟不共起殲滅此禍國殘民之患、必遭全民傾覆之大禍、今年七月三十日、汪院長蔣委員長通電、昭告國人、有言曰、今日救國之道、治本莫要於充實國力、治標莫亟於清除共匪、蓋國力不振、由於民力不充、民力不充、由於農村破産、工業幼稚、故商業無形凋敝、舍發達國民之生産力、則别無充實國力之道、而匪氛肆虐、患在腹心、赤燄充塞、人淪禽獸、若不剿除、不特人民無安居樂業之可言、則一切計劃、均受牽制、乃至捍衛固圉禦係自衛、亦皆不能爲有效之實施、中央憂慮及此、故集中各軍、悉心進剿、以期於最短期間、清除匪禍、以絶此民族國家最大之隱患、</p>
<p>唇齒相關　上海雖爲全國首富之區、然其繁榮之基礎、實亦繫於全國内部之安全、吾嘗言之、上海猶魚、内地猶水、近年以來、上海人口財富、雖均有鉅量之增加、似有日趨於發展繁榮之勢、内地諸省、共匪爲患、農村破産、富有之家、紛紛挾其財賣、託足上海、以求安全、而貧不聊生之農民、亦多趨此、以求解决生活、</p>
<p>殊不知財富集中、而不知所以流通之、非都市繁榮之象、人口增加、失業者日衆、乃城市生活之病態、欲求魚之生長、而不先實池水、實不可得也、故今日之剿匪工作、直接雖係求内地人民之安全、農村經濟之復蘇、間接亦所以促上海之發展與繁榮、内地之與上海、旣如唇齒之相關、尤似魚水之相得、故我上海之市民、雖處此富麗康樂之境、應益思内地人民、顚沛流離之苦、而際此積極進勦匪共之時、尤當一致擁護、各盡其能、以助勦匪工作之進展、</p>
<p>愼勿漢視　嗚呼、明末慘禍、殷鑑非遠、居安思危、愼勿漠視、星火可以燎原、匪禍足以亡國、顧我市民、一致奮起、誓滅此民族心腹之隱患、以救此民族覆亡之大禍、</p>

<p>▲復旦勝光華　復旦大學足球、爲大學隊中之優秀隊伍、歷年戰績、頗有可觀、去冬且獲中華足球會中宇組冠軍、關洵安爲東華名將、馮念漢余順章、後起可兒、全隊平均、攻守均佳光華足球、每况愈年、昨與復旦作戰於曁南球場、爲一面倒之形勢、光華顧此失彼、疲於奔命、上半時復旦余順章周紹文各中一球、下半時復旦仍取攻勢、屢擾光華後防、余順章又中兩球、王文靖亦記一功、光華雖頑强抵抗、破釜沉舟、但心有餘而力不足、復旦遂以五比零勝、裁判員沈回春、</p>

<p>昨日棒球塲上、優游與臘克斯之比賽、上半時優游在逆風地位、行軍不利、臘克斯狐駕虎威、氣熖萬丈、半小時内、優游竟連失四球、令人心驚膽慄、以爲必敗無疑、詎意優游奮發有爲、扳回一球後、下半時乘風破浪、銳氣大盛、獲一而再、連中四球、結果以五比四反憂爲喜、轉敗爲勝焉、至於逸園東華與華塞斯陸軍之比賽事前以爲東華李義臣赴港、關洵安不能出塲、以華塞斯之雄威、戰勝昨日之東華、似在意料之中、豈知大不爲然、華塞斯於開首一分鐘内獲得一球後、右前衛忽以傷脚退塲、從此祇十人應戰、後防時露空處、遂被東華曹秋亭連中兩球、得最後勝利、可謂鴻運高照矣、今日曁南戰英海軍於棒球場、海軍由康脫出場、甚兇、曁南必須小心、中華會共有八場比賽、詳情分誌如下、</p>

<p>華塞斯到滬後、先以一比一和曁南、繼以八比四勝優游、威聲所播、括目相看、昨與東華在逸園之戰、更足爲球迷關心、事前輿論、以爲是東華之唯一難關、詎料東華鴻運高照、因上塲一刻鐘時、軍隊右前衛史密斯、卽行受傷離、以後抵以十人應戰、雖於開首一分鐘内獲勝一球、終被東華曹秋亭連中兩球、結果成二與一之結果、軍隊損失一員大將、實力固然大受影響、然東華内部防綫之周密、前内衛合作之鞏固、實不可、抹殺、丘八中鋒茂倫之凶猛、被李寗王長頴二人嚴密監視、毫無活動機會、論表演、上半時形勢緊張、下半時東華攻多於守、華塞斯雖破釜沉舟、各無建樹、</p>

<p>東華開球、屠開元中路舉義、送球左方、萬象華還傳敵門正前、曹秋亭衝前未及、被敵搶出、馮運佑還進、又被史密斯先一步踢出、中鋒接得穿過王長頴、而傳與派根、直達底綫、一路無阻、東華門前、頓時告急、派根送至門前、李寗不及班師、茂倫奔前一脚、球勢殊猛、觸周賢言之脚而入門、三傳兩脚、卽建大功、非特東華爲之一驚、卽觀衆亦爲之駭異非凡、離開僅一分鐘耳、華塞斯氣焰大振、左右翼躍躍欲試、時擾邊疆、一次李寗阻出、一次周賢言仆救、化險爲險、</p>
<h3 id="c196">守門慌張秋亭立功 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>東華猝不及防、遽爾失守、不得不謹愼從事、小心戒懼、前内衛絡聯一氣、嚴密監視前鋒興師問罪、搗亂敵營、兩冀均有妙傳、敵方戒備亦嚴、惟守門反而手慌足亂、坐立不安、時有失陷可能、同時華塞斯右前衛Ｐ史密斯與萬、象華搶球傷脚、踣地不起、就此祇以十人應戰、防禦力、量大滅、後方愈顯不支、時有顧此失彼之勢、屠開元一次遠射、使敵飽受虛驚、萬象華東陲開破、門前落下、曹秋亭頭頂、並不巧妙、但守門慌張不堪、接而失手、球正落入球門綫内、東華遂獲一球、成一比一平手、</p>
<h3 id="c197">興波作浪又下一城 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>從此東華聲勢大盛、加以對方守將缺少一個、萬象華得大施活動、華塞斯球門如前靶、成爲衆矢之的、受盡風浪、飽吃驚嚇、繼見萬象華角球送出、守門衝出撲之、打出未遠、但人則跌地、混戰聲中、曹秋亭在人叢中冷箭射中、東華又獲一球、往後萬又送高球、曹秋亭在門前六七碼頭頂、由守門脚上彈出、再攻、恰巧打在守門臉面、莫明其妙中、竟被擋回、幸極、</p>
<h3 id="c198">盡忠報國相安無事 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>再戰聲中、華塞斯報復心切、全軍開赴前綫、猛攻東華、東華見勢不妙、守多於攻、全力抵抗、李寗八面威風、保駕有功、王長頴盡忠報國、不遺餘力、吳幼良屠開元馮運佑、心心相應、無懈可擊、周賢言一夫當關、萬夫莫敵、丘八來勢雖猛、無隙可乘、茂萊雖很、受人監視、一籌莫展、徒勞心力、功虧一簣、且專力於攻、疏忽於守、反被賈幼良單槍匹馬、直搗黃龍、城門忽又失陷、第以越位取消、是後馮運佑負傷作戰、後方告警、卽調陳洪光歸營保駕、相安無事、二比一成最後結果、</p>

<p>小春天氣、日麗風和、逸圍雖有一塲在戰、分去不少球迷、但棒球場依然有三千看客、優游本屆出師不利、第一戰卽遭法商毒手、昨戰臘克斯江善敬足傷未愈、阿巧不知何往、雖隨軍而未出塲、王樹森調昇一級、致後防空虛已極、上半時連失四球、觀衆惴惴不安、無不爲該隊扼腕、詎知有志事成、下半時賴諸將努力反攻、竟以五對四反敗爲勝、不可謂非死裏逃生也、</p>
<h3 id="c200">石破天驚重防盡陷 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>臘克斯者、亦軟中帶硬之隊也、有時狠如猛虎、有時弱如綿羊、其動作之狡猾、脚頭之奇硬、在在使人生畏、開球未久、哈德得球載欣載奔、搶入罰球區域、碰入一球、優游兩度反攻、未能得手、羅德門在開球線與黃瑞華、糾纏不已、瓊生得隙卽乘機轉入朱璆之後、迫近優游之門前、王才高挽救無方、鮑沙列霎時趕到、胸脯一挺、球已入門、五分鐘後、鮑沙列再得一球、臘隊攻勢仍不稍衰、未幾朱璆又以四夫之勇、在罰球區域犯規、羅德門主罰十二碼、造成四對○之大比數</p>

<p>此時雙方之優劣形勢、有如高峯大海、不可仰望、而觀衆亦灰心冷意、皆料優游必無回生之望、殊不料風雲變幻、有若白衣蒼狗、陳家球義憤塡膺、秋波一轉、梁樹棠受寵若驚、立刻投以極佳之報效、家球得球闖入對方中衛線、德沙二將並轡來迎、家球乖覺葉低翻花、交與老孫、砰然一脚、羅伯姿措手不及、遂失一球、而上半時亦於此告終、</p>

<p>下半時優游立志報仇、開球之後、王樹森卽與梁樹堂繼續輪送軍火、臘隊禁地、頓時鷄犬不寗、柯克倫一失足成千古恨、陳家球暗渡陰平、至相當地位、傳與孫錦顒、大小兩何根、怒目咬牙、齊來阻止、孫小施神技、稍一較身、撇二人於腦後、拉弓搭箭、射中紅心、距開球時不過二分耳、混戰良久、孫錦順捲土重來、至對方罰球區域、窘於小何根、乃偷交李碩友、三度破門、其比數僅差一隻、</p>

<p>此時優游之旗幟、鮮明非凡、東衝西突、得心應手、東家球行不得也、轉交老孫、邁進　程、臘隊後防、伏兵齊起、孫卽送與李碩友、縱進球門、咫尺一足、造成平手、李碩友立功之後、依然狠態撩人、時時在東部呐喊、孫鐵腿在中路奮力厮殺、混亂間勇森趁勢掩殺過去、連人帶球、一齊衝出網底、乃以五對四反販爲勝、此後未已、銀笛大鳴、臘隊乃嗒然歸去、反顧優游諸將、莫不興高采烈、笑逐顔開也、</p>

<p>▲小余球藝大進步　余田光在硬地賽中、一路淘汰郭予杰史規亞柯拉沙鄭兆佳、而得與林寳華决賽之權、其近來之表演、確有刮目相看之概、發球有力、惜昨日在臨要關頭、造雙錯誤無數、非常可惜、其正反抽球、深入對角、有數次佳妙之角球、攻入寳華之反手、使林亦嘆服、起手亦快、惜乎有時、使用近球時、用力稍輕、皆未過網、其敗於林寳華、全爲經騐問題、再假以時日、小余未可限量、</p>
<p>▲第一盤裁判錯誤　　由老頭兒高美任裁判、余田光發球、林寳華連下三局、余田光努力奪回二局、林以四比二佔先時、第七局余發球、第一記林觸網、復接連出界二次、計數應爲四十對零、但裁判宣告者爲各三十、視線員克倫諾夫卽起立更正、奈老頭死不服氣、堅持已見、克乃退而向委員長抗議、結果小余失敗成五比二、一時觀衆紛紛不平、委員長乃向林余及裁</p>

<p>判等商議結果、仍維持判决、其次二局、小余得勝、追成五比四、林以六比四第一盤、如裁判不錯誤、此時應尙爲五比五、勝負尙不可必、</p>
<p>第二盤可勝而敗　第二盤余田光聲氣一振、以四比一佔極對優勢、林奪回二局、第八局余以四十對零佔先、以發球雙錯誤、竟成平等、結果爲林所勝、五比三變成四比四、林以五比四超出、余以有力以壓殺、連得二局、以六比五追出、次局余發球、從十五對四十落後之地位、追成平等、而又佔先一記再一分可勝此盤、惜余不能維持其勝勢、爲林所得、結果以八比六余再敗、末一局已無心戀戰、林以六比一再勝、</p>

<p>飯的吃下肚子會胞、飽了之後會有精神、有了精神　能努力去幹事、這個事實的嬗遞、差不多從開天闢地之後、神農氏發明種植五穀那時候起，就是這様了吧！仔細地把它一想，確實有些興趣，到了現在，歐風美雨吹遍中華，有一般時髦人物，大都是改變了花様，吃什麽麵包，於是吃飯問題，一變而爲麵包問題，假如你遇見失業的朋友，也許會談到麵包問題怎様解决？與其說帶歐化的麵包問題，不如直捷些說純粹國貨的吃飯問題來得貼切。</p>
<p>上海，在内地的一般朋友看來，眞是吃飯最容易的地方；可是適得其反，上海不虛說的是個吃飯最難的地方，不信，可以舉出實例來證明，假如有一家公司丨公司二字，是個　統的名詞，租一間客堂、也可說是一個公司丨或是一個學校丨也和公司一様的解說丨要招請一二個人，登三四行二十字高的小廣告，我們的一般等容易飯吃的人，就會不遠千里的訪問找尋，不問自己的資格夠不夠，經騐足不足？貿貿然的進去應試，結果、名落孫山、大半淘汰，從此種不得不等候第二個機會到來、一天一天的買報紙，看見：「聘請」「徵求」之類的廣告，再也不會把它錯下一下，一次二次、三次四次的這様下去，到頭來依然故我，有些從内地來的人，在上海有親戚朋友的，那例還可以叨叨光；有些到了上海，没有認識的人，賃定公寓，包了飯食，帶的錢有用完的時候，結果，投浦自殺、你想慘不慘？這様想來，上海飯是比較内地爲難吃了，但是有一班人可以不化錢、吃到各種的異味，這一班人，上海人尊他們一聲癟三，癟三也有派别，譬如三馬路的癟三和四馬路的癟三，各不相犯，各有各的地段，各有各的來路，午飯或晚飯的標凖時候過後，癟三們相率提破碗，執紙兜的守候在各自的小弄或路口，飯作司務把吃客吃剩的殘銀挑轉，他們好似有規則一般的祗消走上前去倒了出來，這様，他們就得不勞而食了，據說更有一般此中的老手，倒來的飯，自己吃不完、把它用開水一泡，二十文一碗去轉賣給黃包車夫做點心吃！這様癟三，也可算得是經濟學家。</p>
<p>十分富的人，是少接近、不能明白地了解他們的生活如何，但是理想起來，當然也不至於有什麽差别，因無關乎此文，且不說它，中上人家，差不多常有接近的機會，所以得略知一二，他們的生活，是次優裕的，所謂家主婦們，是有主婦之名，而無主婦之實、家庭一切瑣碎事務，都委諸子女的奶媽，打雜的娘姨，每逢吃人家的飯的人，本心總不會十分好，常會將很好的粥飯，剩餘的菜餚，抛棄在陰溝裏，這様的暴殄天物，雖然不會如迷信家所謂給天雷焚殛，但是我想對於自己的良心上，也有些說不過去，</p>
<p>一般將瀕絶境的失棄朋友，要想找一碗吃，有如上述之難，而另一種人看得吃飯又如此之易，這眞是人類大大的不平等！</p>
<p>内地人說：「上海地方，吃飯容易」，大概是指中上人家的傭人和那般癟三而言，却不能當它是一句極普遍的話。</p>
<h3 id="c225">貴州的特種食品 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 譚文炳</p>
<p>貴州是在西南方面的一省，遍地皆山，在中國内地要算是最貧苦的地方了。但是貴州有許多的特産，是外省不易見到的，現在略述一二，以告讀者：</p>
<p>▲娃娃魚　在貴州貴陽一帶的河中，除普通的鯉魚鯽魚而外，特産得有一種娃娃（註一）魚，這種魚是兩棲動物，它的形狀，完全和人一様，有手有足，能立能坐，頭上眼耳口鼻皆俱，身上有麟，口仍魚口，顎下有鰓，以作在水時呼吸之用，大的有一二尺長，呌起來恰如初生的小孩子啼哭一様，所以呌做娃娃魚，一年之中，在夏天最容易見到，當着夕陽西下的時候，它們便成羣結隊的爬上岸來，或坐或立，或呌或啼，遠望之，猶如赤身的小孩一様，不過其性甚靈，見有人來，即鑽入水中，所以捕促亦不甚易。但是有時被漁人捕獲，售於市上，殘忍的人們，想嘗異味，仍然把它們當做普通的魚類看待，殺而食之，其味甚鮮，惟烹調不得其法，則味腥而難食了。若是它們命運好的話，遇着慈善的人，不惟不忍心吃它，而且替它打一隻金耳環，戴在它們的耳上，作爲記號，仍然把它們放回河中，以後漁人遇着它們，再也不來捕捉了，</p>
<p>▲洛湖辣椒　辣椒本來是到處皆有的，但是貴州的洛湖（註二）辣椒，是和普通的不一様·因爲普通的辣椒，是一年一季的草本植物，而貴州的洛湖辣椒，乃是生長在大樹的上·它的味道不惟比普能的辣椒好吃，而且無論何種菜，只要加上洛湖辣椒，雖在六月炎天，也能保持十餘日之久而不變味，所以普通的辣椒，每斤不過數百文，而洛湖辣椒，就非一二元一斤不可了。不過它們的産地，是在貴州的洛湖縣，移到别的地方是栽不活的，這大概因爲貴州人酷嗜辣椒成癖。每食非辣椒不飽，所以造物特别生出此植物來賜給它們吧！</p>
<p>其他的特産尙多，因篇幅有限，下次有機會，再來談吧。</p>
<p>（註一）　娃娃丨貴州人呼小孩子爲娃娃。</p>
<p>（註二）　洛湖丨地名，貴州之一縣。</p>

<p>— 朱梅自巴黎寄</p>
<p>自然到巴黎的第一餐是去中國飯館吃中國飯，這是在船上預先就想好了的。我天天吃麵包委實吃得有點討厭了，就起吃中國飯的確是一件開心的事。中國飯店在巴黎有天津，東方，萬花樓，中華樓，上海樓，北京飯店幾家，在巴黎附近比映古地方還有三家。飯店中萬花樓是最大，爲粤籍人所開設。其餘幾家大小都差不多，惟天津飯店的主人是法國女人，以前係老蕭的妻子，老蕭差不多留學歐州的學生没有人不知道他，他因爲開飯店賺了很多錢，但結果都被法國女人拿去了，同他離了婚，自己後來又去别家飯舖當廚子。所有的中國飯店差不多都是中國僕役，祇中華樓用了幾個法國人。中國飯店中吃的多係中國學生，其次外人也很多。</p>
<h3 id="c227">常熟的喫 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>常熟的醬雞，變了蘇州人的佳饌，開設在蘇州的觀前的有龍鳳齋馬詠齋等多家，好像同采燕齋的西瓜子，互相嫓美了。照我們常人　看起來，除了醬雞醬肉以外，特産的東西很多，像潭塘的金爪蟹，不亞於陽澄湖的出産。大河的蝦，殻軟而薄，梅雨後，有　有子，他産所不及，長江中的海白蝦，味道尤加鮮美。古里村的水蜜桃，漕涇的深水菱，横涇的馬鈴瓜，雪溝的西瓜，頂山的鮮毛粟子。寳巖的白楊梅，都是水果中的佳品。别地的人，恐怕一時不能知道，所以也不聞名了。春秋佳日，結伴遊山，一嘗西門外的山前豆腐乾，和北門外的紫熟菱，這是遊虞山的人，類能道之的。米類中的香粳血糯。也是常熟的特産，據說在遜清時代，作爲進貢之品，可惜血糯的出産，日見其少了。其他零碎食物。不可勝數，大約和别的地方相同的吧。</p>
<p>現在常熟的特産，大概以馬詠齋的醬雞醬肉，最爲著名。據我所知，吳江嚴墓鎭的醬雞，實在不亞於常熟，可惜没有人替他們鼓吹一下，否則和楓涇鎭的丁蹄，堪稱伯仲了，比較起來，常熟菜館吃些東西，勝於蘇滬一帶。所以于騷心康南海輩，從前常作虞山之遊了。</p>
<h3 id="c228">良鄉栗子和偏偏 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 史濟宏</p>
<p>上海人有這麽一句俗語：「良鄉栗子，難過日子，」偏偏今年的良鄉栗子攤觸目皆是，滿坑滿谷，偏偏今年的日子眞的比往年更加難過，閙不景氣，上排門，富的有錢没處用，窮的要用錢却没有用，平平常常一句俗語，竟眞的變成了讖語，良鄉栗子越多，象徵着人們的日子越加難過，</p>
<p>偏偏上海人會起花様，單吃栗子不夠，還要眞眞蜜炒；攤上留聲機還不夠熱閙，偏偏還要四燈五燈無線電。成本加重，利息减輕，良鄉栗子，難過日子，又加了一個象徵。</p>
<p>通常一包栗子，每包大洋四分，合銅元十二枚，今年偏偏不漲價，而且還買二包送一包大尶𡯓，雖則數时没有增加，可是「良鄉栗子，難過日子」又添了一個顯明的象徵，不然，生意好，大家加價都來不及，遑論買二包送一包？</p>
<p>難字，照拿坡崙說起來是祇有笨人的字典上纔有，當然囉！我們的金錢一個個流出去，正因爲没有本領而成功笨坯，於是有這一句良鄉栗子，難過日子的話來了。</p>
<h3 id="c229">蟹的紀錄 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>蟹的種類，倘若研究起來，也極有趣的一回事；然而歡喜持螯的人們，不過滿口大嚼罷了；不曉得它的出身和地域大有關係呢！海上的一般老饕家，當六七月裏頭「青蟹」上市，（青蟹，卽蝤蛑，）大家知道，來自浙寗，生於海塗，尊爲上品；但一二西菜館，居爲奇貨，至普通平凡的席上是不會嘗著這一種美味；「青蟹」大的，他的體積，周圍可尺許，而兩隻大螯，尤其臃腫而肥，力的强度，往往足以截斷人指；待到入鍋煮熟的時候，放在白瓷的盤中，那色采尤顯得緋紅，好像靜瑚一般，煞是可觀呢？三十年前，上海廣帮出盂蘭會時，作爲敬神的最貴東西；倘拿來當下酒物，這不是像嚴筱舫有錢的而靠究口味的，不敢過問；後來清道人，總算也是吃蟹的著名人物了，其實他老人家是非常節儉，「青蟹」還是嫌貴，不肯耗費以供口腹的食慾！</p>
<p>上海市上多以『洋澄湖蟹』爲號召，因爲這種蟹，産地最爲豐富，蟹身亦較之其他似乎來得大，雌的竟有重至一斤多兩，也不希罕：實在虛有其表，内容和所含的膏液，未必精美；你！眞細細辨别，便知道比不上在鄉村間，漁家籪上踫起來的蟹，要佳妙得多哩！吾們嘉定東南鄉有一種呌『王字蟹』同『工字蟹』，最爲得名；可惜産量略少，不到深秋天氣，還不易捕得，這種蟹能夠使人認識，就在他殻的背上，宛然像有『王』字『工』字兩種分别；倘或不信，放到鍋中，拿别種解，大小相等，攙和在裡頭，一到燒熟的當兒，揭起蓋來看，『王』字『工』字必在上面，而他蟹必壓在下面，這是最顯著的一個例證；所以這種蟹的堅老充實，在臨死掙扎力的量上看出，而價格也就要名貴了！</p>
<p>現在，差不多蟹已經發足，（俗語，蟹多，呌發，）但這兩種蟹，還未見上市，西門鄉『漳浦蟹』，最晚，蟹身也較小，而脚較長，脚上的毛些微黃色，熟悉蟹的出處來歷老輩，竟可一望卽知；有一位姓『顧』的，名『黻亭』，今年近古希了；他生平有嗜蟹癖，家内時時有蟹飼養在缸中，倘想到要吃，那末隨手取携，遂可以過了蟹癮，不須到外面去出貴價尋覓，這眞算得善於吃蟹的專門家了！有人去問他，你！蟹是何處得來呢？他終不肯說出，就在没有蟹可嚼的時季，提出一個『蟹』字來，他接口說『我有！我有！』他的吃蟹也和别人兩様，有時在酒肆中把一隻蟹，先折了螯足，逐一剥而嚼之，酒也醺了，實則一隻蟹還賸餘蟹圖圖，（俗語）未曾動過指，他飲罷了酒，還携回家裏去了；在吃夜飯時始完他吃蟹工作，這種吃法，也可算最經濟的一個計畫，我十分佩服他，到今日不可不寫出來以供同嗜的人們看看！</p>
<h3 id="c230">喫在蘇州 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 秉謙</p>
<p>七八年前，也在只楓葉渲紅，桂子飄香的時候吧！我負笈杭垣，寄身在背山面水之的江。有個蘇州的同學，帶了些土産到校，多蒙分潤，旣快朶頥之後，就草了一篇「吃在蘇州」的小品文字，在時事新報的青光欄裏發表。有位廣東朋友，大名我已經忘記，却堅持吃在廣州，和我大打筆墨官事。最後他盛氣凌人的提出百餘元一個的廣東月餅，來問我寒酸的學子，嘗過没有？我說只是資族化的吃，和蘇州平民化的吃，怎能相提並論？辯論才算告了終結。寒暑數易，恍然如昨。我眞夢想不到會飄泊到山明水秀，人文薈萃的蘇州。確是幸運，從前吃是紙上空談，現在和理化室内的勞作一様，可以實地試騐了。</p>
<p>本來衣，食，住，行，是我們日常生活中的要素。假使把人生詳細的分析，誰不是爲衣食奔走？擴大一點說：世界的恐慌，不景氣，麵包問題，不也是重要的主因嗎？</p>
<p>就是聖人也說：「食，色，性也。」人從呱呱墜地，直到奄奄一息，數十年的過程中，没有一天能和「食」字脫離關係，丨除非疾病。「三日不食則飢，七日不食則死，」更有定論。所以我來談「吃」，一般道學先生，也不致視我爲饕餮之徒吧？</p>
<p>蘇州是魚米之鄉，天堂福地，所以吃的方面，較之他處，也略勝一籌。你走到熙來攘往的玄妙觀裏，就聞到很濃的五香和葱韭氣。那裡有異味齋的猪排。糖醋的，椒鹽的，把美可口，悉聽尊便。有五芳齋的荳腐漿，按衛生的原則上說，是最富滋養料的。但是提到荳腐漿，總使人有點淡苦的回味。我第一次和個本地同事逛玄妙觀。他首先創議去吃荳腐漿。我非常奇怪，以爲荳腐漿有什麽好吃？及至嘗試以後，才覺着别有風味。漿裡雜着蝦米，海皮，蔴油，辣椒，醋，醬油……「五味調和百味香。」我們吃得口滑，又連了一碗，每碗價祇銅元十六枚，可謂價廉物美了。再有熟氣蒸騰的加蟹饅頭，油光潤露的黑色油魚，厚薄匀和的藕粉，也頗令人垂涎。在人叢當中，有呌賣梨膏糖的，吳語軟儂的調子，已夠使人竚足，至於糖的好吃與否？我却没有嘗過。其餘的零攤小舗，綜錯排列，簡直是集小吃之大成了。</p>
<p>蘇州的糖果，並不是我替他做義務宣傳，早已是馳名遐邇。國聯調查團光臨敝國的時候，不是特地到蘇州來採辦糖果嗎？糖果店的門口，像開陳列展覽會般的排設着許多小橱，和彩色玻璃瓶，裏面五光十色，名目繁多，他對人們，尤其是視糖如第二生命的小孩子，具有偉大的魔力。什麽巧格力，古克力，……當非我輩所能染指。在「又要馬兒好，又要馬兒不吃草」的情况之下，我最喜歡的是奶油松子糖。糖的外面，有潔白透明的玻璃紙包着，吃到嘴裏，鮮甜適口，而且松子還有「延年益壽」的好處。只是别處獨無。蘇州僅有的，我特向讀者諸君。簡單的介紹。</p>
<p>在清茶館裏的吃，那就更平民化了。幾個銅元一包的西瓜子，可以消磨很多的時候。名目也有好幾種，如甘草，香水，玫瑰……等，旣小而脆，所以吃的時候，和普通闊背瓜子，或是瓜子大王不同，倒要有點吃的藝術呢！還有灑滿甘草末的五香荳，青梅，橄欖……在談笑風生的當中，夾着些剥落聲，也是蘇州别有的茶館風格罷！</p>
<p>時序是秋令了。水菓店的門口，都設着糖栗的炒鍋。街頭巷尾，滿着熟菱和洋澄湖肥蟹的呌賣聲，炒白菓的擔子到處都可看見。坐在家裏，無舉足之勞，得着鮮美的食品，祇有天堂的蘇州，可以享受。</p>
<p>至於陸稿荐的醬肉，潘萬盛的腐乳，都是從前的貢物，而今的異味。其餘好吃的東西，眞是美不勝收的多着呢！</p>
<p>想到廣東百餘元一個的月餅，和「食費萬錢，猶無下箸處」的貴族化的吃，有什麽兩様？我以異鄉寄足的立場來說：吃在蘇州，當之决無愧色吧？</p>

<h3 id="c231">文學家成功秘訣 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 仲方</p>
<p>曾見某筆記謂施耐庵水滸先以三十六主要人物的畫像掛在書房裏，朝朝暮暮對着看，後來「神而明之」，下筆若有「神助」，于是三十六人者乃活躍於紙上了。</p>
<p>這是我們中國祖傳的文學家成功的一種「秘訣」。時至今日，水滸一書經過了幾番考證，已經斷定牠並非姓施名耐庵者個人意匠之作，而是一羣民間傳說累積的果實；所謂三十六主要人物的性格，並非由施耐庵看熟了畫像揣摹得來，而是許多無名的民間藝術家共同揑塑成功，不過由施耐庵加以最後的編定罷了，因此某筆記所傳的「成功秘訣」也就不攻自破，成爲無量數「穿鑿附會」中間的一種了。</p>
<p>我們祖傳的「成功秘訣」中還有一種，鼎鼎大名的司馬遷就是此「秘訣」的創始者或實騐成功者。這就是說司馬遷文章之所以「不拙直」，乃因爲他「周遊名山大川」。在交通不便利的中國古代，「周遊名山大川」確不是多數人做得到的，然而司馬遷居然「周遊」了，文章居然不凡了，所以這「秘訣」是信而有徵的。「名山大川」這些死東西，丨丨不，應該說是「美麗的大自然」，或者能夠使一個詩人多幾首詩，或者竟能使一個詩人的作品更加「渾厚奇詭」，有如入蜀後的杜甫，但是散文家的司馬遷的斷爛朝報式的本紀列傳中也會得着「名山大川」的帮助，想起來眞是難以索解。中國古來一些「批評家」講到文章的「通」或「好」時，總說「神而明之」一類的話，「名山大川」云者，當亦是「神而明之」的一種，反正一部史記中包含了文章的各様法門是「久已論定」的。</p>
<p>金聖嘆却就乾脆的多。他判定水滸是學得了太史公筆法。他這「發見」，其實也是中國祖傳的文學家「成功秘訣」第三種，即所謂「脫胎」。現代施蟄存先生用了「現代語」翻譯出來，就是「每一個文學者必須要有所借助於他上代的文學」。　　不用說，書房裏掛了書像朝朝暮暮對着看，到氏太煩磨，而且先須請人畫了像，尤其煩磨：「名山大川」呢，雖則近來「水陸聯運」，公路大闢，似乎比司馬遷時代方便得多了，可是風塵僕僕，也夠討厭，還不如安坐在書房裏「借助於上一代」，一部石印的莊子，石印的文選，至多不過化上四塊錢，經濟時間，兩皆合算。這様一比較，就見得斷斷然勸青年們先求生活經騐充實的人們，委實是傻不可及了。</p>
<h3 id="c232">布販子 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>摇小花鼓，布販子從這村走到那村，從這家走到那家。</p>
<p>「……疼疼疼……買布買布……疼疼疼……今天的貨色眞多……疼疼疼……」</p>
<p>放下肩頭的擔子，他大聲喊着，氣喘喘的，這些地方他全很熟悉，這一帶的姑娘他也全很熱悉。只是不曉得她們的名字。鄉下的房子非常奇怪，如果幾家在一起，總有一個很大很大的公用院子。在這院子中，不論在什麽季節，你全可以看到滿地的牛糞，鷄糞，以及在空中飄蕩着的尿布。</p>
<p>他一面在院子中摇着小鼓，一面擇條板凳坐下來，等候着顧客。不消說這些顧客全是姑娘，她們一聽到他的聲音，老是馬上從樓上的格子窗裏探出頭來，俯身向他打招呼：</p>
<p>「喂喂賣布的，讓我們看看你的新花様！」</p>
<p>於是他聽到滾石塊一般的，那些性急的姑娘們從各家的樓梯上下來，圍着擔子的四周。他的擔子有許多抽斗，她們每次都要翻遍了這些抽斗，看遍了所有的絲線，花邊，别針，鈕扣，以及一切零星的東西。至於布那更不必說了，她們不但要仔細端詳，而且要一匹匹的分别考究。　　「這些花様才上時！」</p>
<p>「不，那早過時了，我的姊姊去年早已買過。」</p>
<p>「看倒很好看，不過不經穿，摸摸像紙一様的薄。」</p>
<p>「除點價錢吧，我倒很想買幾尺丨丨」</p>
<p>她們把布匹翻來翻去，嘈雜着，像在糖菓店門口的孩子們。那些犀利的眼光全落在他的臉上，彷彿在探索，想抓住他的營業上的弱點，向他進攻。</p>
<p>她們全是年輕的，活潑的，像鄉下的陽光一様明媚的姑娘。可是很奇怪，她們全有吝嗇的頭腦，狡滑的手段，就是一個小錢也要佔便宜。</p>
<p>「幾毛錢一尺？」</p>
<p>「誰要這様貴得嚇人的東西！」</p>
<p>「嘻，倒城裏去買不是便宜得多？」</p>
<p>女人們的嘴眞是可怕，她們不管人家虧本不虧本，一味的只想除價，彷彿要除得一錢不剩，白白送給她們才稱心似的。</p>
<p>「好，我再讓幾分！」</p>
<p>他看看四週，看看那些發亮的，刁頑的面孔，無可奈何地？苦笑着回答。</p>
<p>「還得再除掉一點！」</p>
<p>「我也要化了本錢買來，而且我也得化了力氣丨丨丨」</p>
<p>他雖是這麽温和的說，讓步到了無可再讓的地步，但那些忍心的姑娘還是不會滿足；</p>
<p>「做生意的人老是這麽一套，什麽虧本不虧本全是假話，不再除一點我們不買了」　　「虧本是眞話，規規矩矩，不過老主顧當然尺頭可以量足一點。」</p>
<p>經了許久的爭執，生意總算做定了，可是量布的時候更其麻煩。</p>
<p>「多吐一點，多吐一點，你自己說過量足尺頭的！」</p>
<p>「只吐這麽」一點點，眞欺人！」</p>
<p>她們爭着把手按住布，一步不離的跟住他的尺子，指定一大段額外的布，要他送，否則便奪住他的尺子不放。他開始當然不肯，究竟不是京貨店，人情那裏送得這許多？但結果纏不過這些姑娘，也只得馬虎點了，雖則這種交易顯然賺不到什麽錢，自己的力氣顯然又是白花，可是不這様又有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>看着那些滿足了的姑娘一閧而散。他只是憂鬱地，悲哀地摇頭。</p>
<p>進這院子的時候，也許是上午，也許是中午，但他回去老是靠近黃昏了。有時候沐着夕陽，有時候淋着大雨，也有時冒着冒雪，這可憐的布販，摇着鼓，挑着一付沈重的布，踏着疲勞的步子回家。</p>
<p>「一天纒得昏了頭，却只賣到這點錢，夠吃還夠穿？」在歸途中，他也許會把担子放在一個破凉亭裏或者舊廟宇中，數着一天的進欵嘆氣。</p>
<h3 id="c233">文藝雜談 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在魏金枝　近刋的小說「白旗手」裏，我看到了幾句寫「自由的天空的飛鳥」的話。他說人都羨慕着那天空翺翔的飛鳥，但飛鳥，在實際上，是不如他所想像的那麽自由。他批判的說明作爲小說的主人公勤務的這種心理道：</p>
<p>在平時，那是夢様幻想着的，他以彷彿詩人的心境，鑑賞天上的老鷹，仰起頭來膽仰，看看她們襯在遼曠的天空中。自自由由的翺翔，新響鈴般「的鈴铃」地呌着，却不知道那飛是爲了尋食，那呌是爲肚餓　　　現實生活的鞭子，把詩人從這様的幻夢中抽醒的，當然很是不少，可是在目前，依舊多着這様想念的人。所以，我把「白旗手」裏的這兩句話再引出來。詩人們，不要幻夢的再寫那「雁兒們」的翺翔吧。可以進一步的去考察她們爲什麽翺翔的道理與苦惱了。和人類一様，飛鳥們何嘗不是一様的爲着生存而苦鬥？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>沈從文在最近印行的「一個母親」裏，寫了一篇說明他自己的創作態度的序記，開始第一叚就說：</p>
<p>因爲生存的煩惱，我自覺寫男女關係時彷役比寫其他文章爲相宜。寫這東西，我没有與我平時創作的態度兩様，在男女因憶慾所起衝突　，我只盡我的觀察，解釋這必然的轉變。我没有在幾個角色中加以　備成袒護的成見，我似乎也不應有這是作者很忠實的創作態度的自白，一個舊寫實主義作家必然採取的態度。不過，問題也就在這裏，作者在寫作時，是不是眞的没有「成見」呢？這是不可能的。即如照像吧，這似乎是没有「成見」「客觀的寫實」了，然而，人物的位置，光線的角度，是無往而不表現着攝影師的哲學丨「成見」在的。小說方面當然也是一様。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>再說說黎錦明的創作態度吧。在他最近出版的小説集「失去的風情」裏，他也寫了一篇創作態度的自白丨序記。他批判了自己的思想，更進一步的說明：</p>
<p>我的態度丨路人的態度而已。所謂路人，離開了希望，對於自滿，反動，頽廢却又種視着；丨質言之，我的義務，在將某一種事物，指示其缺點而已。而其用意，自是希望好的方面較多。</p>
<p>這當然也還是一種舊寫實主義的理解，但是他，是比沈從文進一步的。雖然「我的義務，在將某一種事物，指示其缺點」，然而，他了解得這其間是有「成見」在的。事實上「没有成見」的作家</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>「他眞是丨個非常俊美的男子呢。」</p>
<p>「你覺得嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然啦，並且他現得像是一個快活的人呢。」</p>
<p>究竟是什麽奇怪的要求使他突然把哲安受到遺産的事說給這啤酒店的下女聽呢？爲什麽他獨自一人的時候不願去想的這念頭，他因爲怕使得自己心裡擾亂起來而加以摒除的這念頭，會在這時跑上他的嘴唇呢？並且他爲什麽肯讓這念頭跑出嘴唇，好像他需要在什麽前重又傾吐他那充滿着苦味的心呢？</p>
<p>他把一隻腿子疊在另一隻腿上說道：</p>
<p>「我的弟弟的運氣眞好，他新近繼了一筆每年有兩萬佛郎收入的遺産。」</p>
<p>她把她那對藍色的含着貪慾的眼睛睜得大大的說：</p>
<p>「阿！但究竟是誰把這遺産給他了呢，他的祖母呢，還是他的姨母呢？」</p>
<p>「全不是的，這是我們家裡的一個朋友。」</p>
<p>「僅祇是朋友嗎？這是不可能的！而他没有留一點什麽給你嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有。我和這人不狠相熟。」</p>
<p>她　想一會兒，隨後嘴上浮着一個奇妙的微笑：</p>
<p>「那麽！你的弟弟眞幸而有着這一類的朋友啦！眞的，怪不得他和你全不相像！」</p>
<p>他想打她一個耳光，爲着什麽原因，連自己也不狠了然。他的嘴巴起着痙攣問她道：</p>
<p>「你這話是什麽意思？」</p>
<p>她現着一副愚蠢而又天眞的様子：</p>
<p>「我嗎，没有什麽。我的意思是說他的機會比你好些。」</p>
<p>他把一個郎丢在桌子上走了。</p>
<p>現在他默默地覆說着這句話：「怪不得他和你全不相像。」</p>
<p>她究竟想着什麽，她這話裡隱藏着什麽意思！這裏面一定含着一種狡猾，一種惡意，一種汚辱。不錯，這女孩子一定以爲哲安是瑪賴沙的兒子。</p>
<p>他想到人家懷疑到他母親的節操，他感動到又停下了脚舉目四顧，想找一個地方坐下來。</p>
<p>他對面另外有一家咖啡店，他走了進去，抓着一把椅子坐下，待役跑來問他要什麽時，他回說：「一杯啤酒。」</p>
<p>他覺得他的心跳得很勵害：皮膚上一陣一陣地起着冷戰。突然他又記起了昨晚瑪洛斯科的話：「這事不會有好結果的。」難道他和這下流的女孩子有着同様的想頭，同様的懷疑嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c256">工商界應注意的一件大事 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 公撲</p>
<p>本刋的讀者，多爲工商界的朋友們，記者覺得最近工商界發現了一件大事，不知道工商界人曾否深切的注意到？那就是國貨在國内運銷也居然會受到國人的反對問題。觀此次福建商人在上海設立的三山會館莊客與中華國貨産銷合作恊會的糾紛事件以及徐州商人阻止國貨流通團到徐推銷國貨的消息，都足以令人對工商業的前途發生無窮的憂懼與懷疑。這個現象的所以發生，其背景雖然複雜，但爲進一步的暴露了，中國工商業在這外國商品激烈傾銷的形勢下，不能有較大發展的一個更顯然的事實，却是毫無疑義的了。至於我們對於此事的注意點，不在國貨産銷合作的恊會與三山會館的誰是誰非，而是要探討整個民族工業資本不能發展根本原因的所在。</p>
<p>考查以前各省内地商人在上海設立所謂莊客的起源，本爲採辦洋貨而非爲購銷國貨，至於土産（即今之所謂國貨）則大多數是就地交易，無需乎什麽莊客的。後來因爲洋貨的銷路一天大似一天，於是由做洋貨以及改良土産製造的種種所謂一國貨」遂應運而生。最近一般的國貨　製造得法，又因價格較爲低廉的原故，所以很能挽回一部分外貨在内地的市場。惟此与國貨工廠爲了裝設機器，資本週轉的便利起見，大多數是都設上海，遂使原以採辦洋貨而設立的内地莊客，乃在有利可圖的原則下同時也採辦國貨起來了。</p>
<p>論到此次糾紛的主因，實際上並不是三山會館的莊客反對推銷國貨，乃是因爲莊客的利益全靠在貨物轉手的一點好處上，今産銷合作恊會直接運貨到福建去賣，便將莊客原有的好處奪去了。是故站在商人以謀利爲立塲來說，莊客們的反對要亦人情之常耳。但我們所要注意的就是在這外貨傾銷競爭劇烈的時候，上海工商界對此種畸形的現象若不速圖打破，則眼見外貨反可在國内通行無阻，有阻則以大砲爲打破一切障礙之武器，而國貨則反運銷不喪。長到以往，中國人豈不眞將永遠爲苦命的人了嗎？</p>
<p>按諸實際，國貨的工廠本來應普遍的分設於内地各省，就地取材（原料，人工）製造，就地的推銷附近各處，這本是其他工業發達國家的普遍現象。現在我們因政治不上軌道，内地各省多半是年年天災人禍、處處兵匪充斥，農材經濟日趨破産，購買力減退，生産力同様的萎縮，於是遂無人敢在内地投資創辦工廠，而所有新工業遂全集中上海矣。但我們工商界所應深切覺悟的，就是此種現　是僅可維持一時，决非久遠之計，若不急圖補救，則苦命的中國人即可能　而不做亡國奴，却是無法　免去做　死　，所以究應如何挽救此危險情勞，　是紙可聽天由命等死呢，都是我們所應注意的一件大事。</p>
<h3 id="c257">七嘴八舌的黃雀 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 花棠棣</p>
<p>秋深了，西風呼呼的吹着，都市的人們，除了没錢的窮小子外，大衣駝絨都已爬上了肩頭，異國的寓公女士們，也許狐皮亦上頸項了。市上「洋澄湖大蟹」的招子，到處都是，一元一只的廣告，在人們的眼簾前跳着：老饕家當然是大快朶頤，因爲有「錢」作後盾，然而没錢的人們啊，祗有將嚵唌向肚裏嚥。</p>
<p>跟蹤着「大蟹」在這秋末冬初上市的，那便要算是「黃雀」了。黃雀一到秋末稻穀在田裏長得滿滿的時候，便極度活躍，不管農夫們流了多少的血汗，不管他們要不要償還地主，更不管他們要靠這僅有的食糧去瞻養妻女，祗是給牠們一個「七嘴八舌」，吃得　零落落。黃雀之來又是成羣結隊的，所以給牠們吃了一次就是一筆很大的損失。</p>
<p>農夫恨透了，一面到了收穀的時候，派人在田裏看守，一面就想了種種的方法，把這許多害人的東西捉住殺掉。</p>
<p>農夫捉黃雀的結果，倒形成了深秋的一種收入，可是那種苦也就夠吃的了。　　太陽尙在地平線上，飛鳥咿啞的唱着歸巢了，黃雀當然也要向牠窠裏跑。黃雀是羣居的。牠的窠巢總在蘆葦深處，所以一到暮靄蒼茫的時候，農夫已經在僻靜處伺候着了。待到看準了「苗頭」，還是不大放心，還要慢慢的　到蘆葦，邊的　岸上去看，察看得　　錯誤了，方始走回家去準備，準備好了捕雀的應用器具，便飽餐一頓，隨即着手裝扮。這裏的所謂「裝扮」，决不是像都市的女人們出外時的搽脂抹粉，也不是紳士般的整冠飭履，不過爲着工作便利起見，把胸口的衣服鈕子張開着，腰裏束一條粗板帶，赤着脚，穿了一雙草鞋，帶着應　器具（應用器具也很簡單，不過是一個長柄絲網斗，和一盞半明不滅的煤油燈而　　，向目的地出發。</p>

<p>— 李樹林</p>
<p>因爲遭受了水災，咱們不得不離開鄉井逃難。但是逃到那裏去呢，到處都是汪洋的大水？</p>
<p>一隻洋划子剥剥剥剥破浪而來，船尾挿着紅三角的××敎難民救濟隊的小旗，船頭站着按着盒子砲的丘八。咱們一大夥本來是想一擁而上的（誰不想呢）？周圍是無邊的水，面前來了一隻救濟的船），但看着盒子砲的冷冷的小眼睛，一些人嚷了幾聲隨即不響了。</p>
<p>我也記不起是怎麽様被拖上了船，我醒來時已經到×埠的江邊了。船停了，我們都給趕進了運貨車，像一束束的貨物；没有坐過汽車的李阿興，在震動和摇擺中嘔吐了别人一身。</p>
<p>到了××敎的××會所，咱們被安置在地下層的屋子裏，滿滿的擠着，躺着。一會兒來了白衣的醫生，說是來檢疫的。我拖着小學生楊開想走出去看一看街景，在大門口被阻止了。恰巧這時有人在互相問答：</p>
<p>甲：『你上那兒去？』</p>
<p>乙：『樓上洗澡……』</p>
<p>我和楊開都一齊感覺到，洗澡咱們是在水裏的時候幹過的，但是，想到在船上時的鬱熱和地下室的悶臭，我們倆都覺得，要是洗一洗，身子該多麽的快活。我們不約而同的說出：『洗澡去，』就跟着乙走進電梯。可是在電梯將要關閉的時候，一個長而瘦的人忽地把我們倆拖了出來，問我們上那裏去。</p>
<p>『洗澡』，我們說。</p>
<p>『你住在什麽地方？』那人問。</p>
<p>『地下室。』</p>
<p>『你想得這麽好，』那人冷笑着說，『樓上你知道是什麽人可以去？别人是三塊錢一天呀！』</p>
<p>『××不是講平等博愛的麽？』楊開很直率地說。</p>
<p>『哼！』那人睜大了眼睛，『没有什麽說的，你自己識相些！』</p>
<p>『不洗也可以，幹麽做出那様兇？』楊開憤憤地說。</p>
<p>澡没有洗得成，大門又不能出去，只好再回到地下室裏來。</p>
<p>一會兒，那長子帶着巡警來，找着我和楊開，提着咱倆的衣領，呌着：『出去丨此地不要你住！』我們倆一聲不響地被推出大門，在靜默中回頭看了那慈悲的博愛的高大洋房底面貌一眼。</p>
<p>咱們想進天國是没有希望的了。</p>

<p>— 段谷香</p>
<p>不幸的我，是出身於貧寒的家庭中。在我三四歲的時候聽母親說：父親因作烟店的生意，把十幾畝地賠的一乾二凈！没有辦法了，便跑到河南去當兵。後來，我的大哥，也跟着走了。這還是「吳大帥」時代的事情。那時，我因年紀尙幼。扛不動槍桿，就錯過了穿「二尺半」與「吃大半子」的道路。</p>
<p>我在家裏是没有土地可以維持生的，所以，我同母　　　到城裏來。　在一家　戶中做「老媽子」，每天做些洗衣服，看小孩，買菜作販一類鎖碎的　，一天忙到晚，没有停止的一　！我呢，也在這裏，早晨替他們洗掃客房，端　水，……晚間，就等候太太老爺的門，因爲他們要天天看電影或聽戲。主人只要一看見我在那兒稍微坐一坐，便用白得嚇人的眼睛死瞅！吵我，駡我：小小的孩子就這様懶！有什麽用！我記得我的腦袋，時常被他打得昏迷！</p>
<p>我這様鬼混了三四年，求知的慾望一天比一天的高起來，一看見他全家的，掌上珠丨丨小少爺，去上學或者回來了，我就感覺得有一陣說不出來的難過，羡慕能夠上學的孩子眞是幸福的！尤其是在我十二歲的時候，天天要送着「小少爺」到學校去，並且還要接回來。我瞧着學校裏的無數小朋友，心裏癢癢的滋味，實在難熬！我的幾次對我母親要求，說我願意讀書去，不願在這裏活受了，然而我的母親不允許，並嚴厲的說：「那來的錢！到外邊餓死你！」</p>
<p>我一聽到這，就非常的氣憤，我總認爲母親的皮氣太怪了。「小少爺」只要一回來，太太就抱過來親親嘴，乖孩子長，乖孩子短的呌個不休。我不解我母親爲何長了這樣的狠的心！</p>
<p>住在西偏院的那個師範學生，可巧正在我這回苦悶的時候放了寒假。我們是很投機，時常在一塊說笑。我常替他買些東西，所以，他特别的喜歡我。彼此一見面，我就將這些問題來告訴他，說明我十分願意認識幾個字，能寫個賬就行了　。然而我是一貧如洗，有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>他說：「求學是不錯要錢的，但是，像他這様的年紀，只要在做完事情的時候，自己能努力自修，也能進步的，可以獲得相當的知識。　他並且又慷慨的說：「在晚間没有事的時候，我可以敎你認識兩個字，只要你願意！天下無難事，只怕心不專！」</p>
<p>他送我一部千字塊，天天敎我寫讀，我是一没有事就念着字，又在紙上，或地上練習書寫。不過，正在學習的時候，不是主人有什麽事呼喚，便是他有同學來找他玩，這些事使我很感覺得討厭，可是我也並不因此而灰心，依舊不斷的前進。</p>
<p>光陰似箭，寒假期已滿，我便中止了學習。但是，他非常關心我的，呌我去和主人要求，在每天晚上八時至十時之間，充許我到民衆夜校去讀書，因爲這時大家都吃罷了飯，太太和老爺都要到十二點的時候才能回來，是没有什麽事情的。如若不能，就爽快的散蛋，不能將青春的身子整個埋葬在此地，可以作點小生意，來維持生活，夜裏到民衆學校去讀書。</p>
<p>我的心是被他打動了，居然，勇氣很足的，在那天晚上和主人談起來，結果呢，是被冷笑的幾聲，並說：「吃喝拿錢，還想不作事情！」帶着很卑視的態度。那時，我眞火冒三尺，和主人决裂了。我的母親亦被辭退。就此我們便開始了新的生活。</p>
<p>我在城外租茅房一間，母親天天給鄰近關帝廟住的士兵洗補衣服，我作些合乎時令的小生意，如買花生，瓜子之類，晚間便到民校夜班念書。這様繼續至四年之久，後來又在該校工作兩年。</p>
<p>回憶母親偶一生病的生活困窘，冰天雪地的呌買情形，和光榮的演講會的勝利，現在能提筆寫信，看白話文的書報，這種情形，兩相對照起來，也確是很有意義的，雖然過去曾受過千辛萬苦，但是，必然，也獲得了相當的成功。於此可知没有堅决的耐苦奮鬥，是絶不能完成自己及大衆的事業，得不到勝利的愉快的。</p>

<h3 id="c261">國際風雲緊張中之俄日關係 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 董顯光講朱玉相錄</p>
<p>一，俄日戰爭的必然性　自從九一八以後，日本一往前進佔領了南滿的全部，從此與蘇俄昆連的邊境，延綿至數千里之長。然而日方起先非常小心，當馬占山部下扼守嫩江橋的時候，日方屡向蘇俄表示，决不越過此橋一步，但是瘋狂的日本軍人，那裏顧得了這許多，所以不久便進佔齊齊哈爾。而日方又鼓其如簧之舌，宣言此後决不越過中東鐵路。其後事實告訴我們，日軍非但越過了中東鐵路，而且長驅直入滿州里，將馬占山和蘇炳文的軍隊，逼入俄境。直到此時，日方眼見蘇俄馴若山羊，無力反抗，前此所抱的小心翼翼，惟恐得罪的謙恭態度，爲之大變。從此野心更大，一心想攫取中東路，加以改築，而使高麗與滿洲里間，得能直接聯通，藉利軍事上的運輸。</p>
<p>此外，尙有三件事，値得我們注意：一日本海軍，一向稱覇於西太平洋，凡屬重要口岸，悉在其手中，當日本向中國提出二十一條要求時，便不許中國以後將各口岸租給别國作爲軍港，其居心之悠久，可見一斑！而今西太平洋中，惟有蘇俄的海參崴，最爲可慮，一旦發展起來，簡直是日本的勁敵，所以，非將這蘇俄海軍的重要根據地佔領不可，祇此一端已頗足爲未來俄日戰爭的導火線了！（二）賽格林島問題。上次日俄戰爭後，日方便要求俄國割讓，並且秘密派地質學家前去測量；所得結果，說是該島火油礦區，都在南部，所以日方就要得了該島的南部，滿心以爲寳藏一起到手了。那裏知道十年以後，再度測量，却又說油礦全在該島北部，仍留蘇俄手内。懊喪之心，可以想見！這也是非拿得不不，値得爲此一戰的。（按油礦之說，係海軍上將杜錫珪氏前年赴日調查海軍時，得諸日海軍高級軍官之口，當屬可信。）（三）目前蘇俄與日本毘連的國境，旣然延綿至幾千里之長，簡直隨時都可發生衝突，蘇俄陸軍隨時可以衝人滿洲里，因此日方極力想驅之於貝加爾湖彼岸，以便安心發展南滿。上面這三件事，如果做不到，東三省便永不能發達起來，人人心裏都存了未來日俄戰爭的印象，還有那一個資本家肯前去投資呢？像近代飛機擲彈的猛烈，一座城市，不消五六天工夫，便能燬滅得乾乾凈凈。爲安定人心，繁榮南滿起見，日方是非戰一下不可的。否則，徒作了許多犧牲，奪得了滿洲以後，究有什麽利益呢？</p>
<p>二，俄日雙方備戰情况　自從敦化至吉會間一段鐵路告竣後，滿洲已能與高麗直接聯運，减少廿四小時的交通時間，便利不少。將來中東路如果被日方收買成功，加以改築，尤爲貫穿而迅捷。不過這很難成爲事實，俄方恐將堅决拒絶，也說不定。目前日本軍官，特别是陸軍方面，天天告訴士兵說，他們的假想敵是蘇俄，因而軍隊中充滿了仇俄心理，宛如美國是他們海軍方面的假想敵一般。大部份日本國内的軍隊，都在北境受訓練。在零度以下的氣候中，穿了很單薄的衣裳，那那裏操練，因而死傷者甚多。但是一經訓練完成，則其成績，必有可觀。當然，這又是特别準備對俄的，因爲將來日俄主要戰，必在西伯利亞及北滿一帶來帶區域内無疑。日本陸相荒木新近要求政府發行一萬萬元的公債，以爲製造精良軍器之用，特别注重化學戰具，二三年來，大有進步，一萬萬元中有三分之一，是用在這上面的。同時，又把駐紥在滿洲的軍隊，一起隸屬於關東軍司令部，以收統一指揮之效，一面招納日俄及哥薩克人，加以訓練，凖備參戰。回頭再談蘇俄方面：則在黑河一帶，積極製造潛水艇及驅逐艦，其目的當然是準備對日本海軍進攻。最近在海參崴人口的商船，行動都被監視，以防洩漏秘密，那裏並築有砲台多座，宜攻宜守。西伯利亞鐵道的雙軌，已經鋪成。據說上次日俄之戰，俄方的所以失敗，就是因爲單軌運輸遲鈍的緣故，則其影響，當然不小。兩個半月以前，蘇俄陸軍總長，親來遠東黑河一帶視察，可見形勢緊張之至。現在遠東邊境的蘇俄軍用飛機，在三百架至五百架之間。軍隊人數不詳，但據本人推測，當亦在二三十萬人左右。</p>
<p>三，蘇日戰爭何時發生　這是没有人敢說定的，也許明天就爆發，亦未可知。看情形大概總是日本先發動，蘇俄决不會取攻勢的。上月十日俄方所發表的日本秘密文件中，有云：日政府曾派員至長春，向滿洲當局密示機宜，對俄挑戰，萬勿操之過急，最好到一九三五年春季再發動。由此看來，則一年以内，戰事或不致發生。前天報載有八九隻日本軍用飛機，飛入蘇俄内地偵察。似此事件，最易引起誤會與衝突；如果俄方以高射砲擊落一兩隻，馬上便有關戰的可能。同時，蘇日雙方已各在東京及滿洲一帶派有情報員，秘密工作，若被捕而槍斃一二人，亦有引起戰事的危險。亦有謂今年十二月或明春，戰事必將發生，因爲西伯利亞一帶冬季作戰最相宜，但這也不過徒憑臆測而已。大概再過一兩月，俄日關係，當有新眉目可見，全視中東鐵路談判，是否繼續進行而定。到那時，俄日雙方，勢將下最後最大的决心了！</p>

<p>但我們已感覺到，一個人自修是有着很多很多的困難的，意志稍不堅定的人時常會把恒心失掉，爲了社會的種種阻難和引誘，一個初入社會的青年最容易失去原有的勇氣，而讓自己没落下去。這簡直可以說是最普遍的現象，在我們這一羣中。即使是一個不會被社會引誘去，而能矢志打破困難的人，自己一個人埋頭自修，也是常會感到枯燥和不足，當然，進步是十分遲緩的。我曾經同許多朋友談過這種的困難，結果使我們想到一個很好的辦法，這種辦法一直到現在還使我們獲得很大的益處，所以我敢寫了出來，告訴每一個在苦苦地自修着的朋友。</p>
<p>這並不是一種很難的事情，把本店的同事或附近的朋友，以自修於同一種學問的，組成一個小團體，這個小團體不需要什麽經費或手續，只是每星期開一次會就行了。在這次的會裏我們規定了下星期每個人所研究的各種問題，在這個星期内，每個人所自修的應以所規定的問題爲範圍（自然，這種規定的問）</p>
<p>題必需由每個人提出而經大家通過）。到了下一星期就把各個人所得到的報告出來，當然，這是不能完全一致的。於是，我們就可用各人自己的見解辯論起來，而給所規定的問題以一個最完全的解答（假使一次不能解决，就移到第二次再來），同時，又規定了下次所應研究的各種問題。</p>
<p>這様，我們不但可以在論辯中得到很快的理解和進步，而自修的枯燥和不足都可解决，而且使自己的自修成爲有系統的學問，同時，還可以消磨一個無事可做的星期日而使自己得到很大的益處。我相信，無論是研究文學，社會科學，自然科學，都可適當地利用這個方式，另一方面，練習口才與養成團體精神，也都可以得到顯著的益處。我們甚至可以稱牠做「我們的大學」。</p>
<p>總之，用集團的精神産生正確的力量，推動每一個人前進，而每一個人成了集團的一份子，造成這一個集團，使牠發生力量，給每個人能得到自修的實效，增進自修的速率。</p>
<p>我希望到處有「我們的大學」。</p>

<p>— 白仕安</p>
<p>雲南普洱通訊</p>
<p>我鄉農民因受着經濟的壓迫，農村的破産，都漸漸的由小地主，富農而變爲中農，由中農而變爲小農，佃農而變爲僱農。至於一般農民的生活，簡直是非人道的，一年辛辛苦的工作，眞是櫛風沐雨，披星戴月，工作的時間可以說是無限的長，至少超過十二小時以上。他的工作時間這麽長，那他每日所得，一定是很可觀的了。可是事實告訴我們完全相反。一般的農民。種的是麥呀！棉呀！但他所吃的多半是雜糧，穿的是爛衣，住的是茅屋，除了節日和特别的宴會外，是不容易開葷的。經濟稍爲豐裕些的農民，一日三餐，至少有兩餐是稀飯；窮苦的，竟有三餐都没有飯吃的呢，遇着荒年或意外的天災人禍，那更是不得了，差不多連雜糧稀飯都不能得一飽了，不得已，惟有聽命於高利的借貸，鬻妻賣子，或把耕牛傢私農具都變賣一空。若還不能維持下去，那野外的蕨菜根，山薯，木葉，大蒜子便是唯一充飢的食料了。老弱無力者連這些都打不到，那就祗有眼巴巴的餓死。祖母常對我說：「現在的世界不對了，從前那一家秋收後没有穀存倉？那一家没有百多吊錢過年？現在多半是「租牛做糧田，做罷又遇天」的了。十五六年前，本村本段的田，總是自己做田人的。糧也自己納，有糧納的人是有多麽的　勢！」的確的！我們鄉裏的好水田，現在已有百分之八十歸到城裏財主的手裏去了。</p>
<p>學校重地，窮人免進，農民生來没有讀書的機會，知識當然缺陋，因此土豪劣紳對于農民便可以予取予奪，經營他們借貸剩餘資金的事業！農民借銀，須以房屋或耕田作抵，利息是五分至六分。若借穀一担，到了還穀時須還兩担。當農民需用耕牛時，須以勞力換地主的牛耕作自己的田。至於土地租給農民，其地租繳納的數額，約當土地所能生産總數之半。加遇水災，旱災，虫災，風災，瘟災等損害，則往往使收獲减少至百分之五十以上，甚至一無收穫。加以窮人日多，盜賊蠭起，因此，耕地日益縮小，甚至無人敢去耕種。</p>
<p>一般小地主和富農的田地，因佃農不敢去耕種，每年收入大爲减少，甚至有許多田地都荒蕪起來，無人過問，十數　的平地，依然爲天然的荒郊。另一方面，因外來和經濟侵略日甚一日，日常生活的用品，多購用外來的商品，尤其是關於衣着一類的商品爲最多，這種外來經濟侵略自然是一般較充裕的小地主和富農甘當其衝，直接使一般地主和富農經濟上大受損失，而日趨貧乏。至於賦稅的繁重，只以田賦一項來說，在同一土地的田賦現在比三十年前增加了三十倍以上，而一切雜捐特捐，那更是不勝枚舉，如屠捐，生牛捐，牛屠報効費，敎育專欵，冥鏹附加捐，契稅附加捐，菸酒附加捐，糧賦，團練費，清鄉費，攤抬費，戶口捐，騐契稅，秤捐……等等。這種賦稅加重的結果，自然是地主的致命傷。因着這種種的原因，一般小地主無法可以避免的，只有都趨向於破産的路上走去。小地主因破産的結果，自然付不起田賦和雜捐，而田地又無人敢去耕種，即使自己去耕種，但因天災人禍的侵擾，其所收穫的價値，還抵不過田賦和捐稅的損失。無疑的，一般人也不敢收買這大批土地，而小地主和富農因横豎得不到一些利益，爲免受貪官汚吏的勒索逼迫的虐待，只得忍痛割愛，常常有人將田單送到城隍廟裏去，掛在城隍老爺的佛櫃的，因此我鄉的土地便都逐漸變爲城隍老爺掌握中所有的財産了。</p>
<p>這並不是悼惜没落，是没落的　實之一頁而已。</p>

<h3 id="c264">「勤儉儲蓄」與「及時購買」 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 張庸</p>
<p>「勤儉儲蓄」，自然是値得兄詔其弟，父詔其子的寳訓，尤其是像我們這些在東家卵翼之下的小伙兒，更應奉爲「金科玉律」，因爲我們的東家，時常摸着他下巴上疎疎的幾株短髭而很得意地對我們說：「當我像你們這麽年歳時，還没有你們現在所得的薪水那麽大，但是我把每月所得的薪水，硬壓下幾分之幾，儲蓄起來。後來越積越多，於是合人夥開着鋪子，逐漸地發展，而獨開，而一人開了幾個鋪子。你們若能像我這麽的勤儉儲蓄，我敢担保你們不到我這麽年歳，市面已比我大了。」</p>
<p>在「勤儉儲蓄」的背面是「及時購買」。「勤儉儲蓄」，若是公認爲是致富秘訣，那麽，「及時購買」的，便不用說得，無疑地是要「没飯吃」了。但是聽說金元王國的「不景氣」便是民衆們不肯「及時購買」所造成的。原來生産者努力地生産，就靠有人去消費。若是生産者生産了大量生産品，而消費者却不去「及時購買」，那麽生産者一則因資金的停滯，二則因貨品的囤積，不得不減工或停止生産。在這減工與停止生産的行動之下，無疑地是有很多生産事業的從業員，將失去一部或全部購買力。於是生産者所生産的生産品，自然要受到了更大的打擊。金元王國在這不景氣的局面之下，遂發生了大統領羅大哥勸人民「及時購買」的新鮮玩意兒。據說，倘使每一個金元王國的大國民，都能把放在銀行裏的存欵，以及每星期所得的報酬，毫不猶疑地一古腦兒用以購買東西，那麽，在不久的將來，金元王國便可以重睹一九二九年的繁榮之盛，而每一個國民也不再會發生麵包的恐慌了。</p>
<p>「勤倫儲蓄」是一片大道理，「及時購買」，說來又是頭頭是道。公說公有理，婆說婆有理，雖然這二個大帽子，不是同様的頭寸，但是戴上了腦袋，却一様的舒適伏貼。這究竟是經濟學上的怎様一種邏輯。可眞有些兒令人識不透。如今且擱起了經濟學上的邏輯不說，我們來研究一下子在我們中國這個生産落後的次殖民地裏，究竟是「勤倫儲蓄」那條路寛坦呢，還是「及時購買」那條路好走。</p>
<p>在這生産落後，整個經濟組織被帝國主義支配的次殖民地裏，自然也說不上某種經濟政策挽救當前的經濟危局。在今日全世界閙着不景氣的年頭兒，咱們中國不用客氣，也不免於來一套「滯銷」的把戲。在美國，或許可以因「及時購買」而活動各種企業的資金，若是我們也跟着來玩這一套，没命地「及時購買」，那怕不還是閙成把民衆存在儲蓄銀行裏的存欵，換成了一箱箱白花花的大洋錢，運到外洋去的局面麽？若是咱們黃臉的中國人，也學了美國人那様把袋裏僅存的五分，去換一杯碑酒喝，那麽，人家也儘不用「及時購買」，一切滯銷的貨物，只須往這遠東市場上傾銷一下子，還怕不會輕而易舉地換救這不景氣的危局，而重臻於繁榮麽？</p>
<p>得囉，金元王國提倡「及時購買」可以挽救危局。咱們中國若提倡「及時購買」，那不啻是割下自己的肉去喂老虎。人家是儘會「三口二咽，豪不客氣地整個吞下去的。</p>
<p>「及時購買」那條路旣走不通，那麽，還是走「勤儉儲蓄」那條路吧。雖然在這整個社會制度動盪轉換時期中，我們也不敢夢想着由「勤儉儲蓄」而成爲「小資本家」，由「小資本家」而成爲「大資本家」，但社會是這麽的混亂無組織，人情是這麽的冷酷，而世界經濟又已崩潰到了如此地步，失業的惡麽，正在張牙舞爪地準備着拉斷每一個人的生命線，「勤儉儲蓄」這方法，豈非是我們在這僅有的消極方法中的一個「積穀防飢」的計劃麽？</p>
<p>所以在美國，果然夠得上喊「及時購買」的口號，以挽救整個金元王國的經濟，但在這經濟組織完全被帝國主義所支配的次殖民地裏，我以爲還是以個人爲出發點的「勤儉儲蓄」做口號，來得妥當些。</p>

<h3 id="c265">毽子 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 小鄭</p>
<p>（一）踢毽子的益處</p>
<p>踢毽子差不多是一種全身運動，頭部頸部腰部腿部脚部全都運動到。在秋末冬初的天氣裏練習，尤極相宜。如能持之有恒，每天早晨練幾十分鐘，除能臨時抵抗寒氣外，練上幾個月，包你身體各部有意想不到的發展，並不下於練八段錦呢。</p>
<p>（二）毽子的製法</p>
<p>毽子在什麽時代發明，已不可考。製造毽子的原料是軟皮一塊，鴨毛管一支，鷄毛幾條，大銅錢一個。先將軟皮剪成銅元大小的圓形兩塊，把銅錢夾在當中，沿邊縫好。再將鴨毛管的一端剪成三义形，縫在軟皮中央，插上鷄毛卽成。此種毽子，市上的皮鞋店常有出售，價目的約銅元四枚至八枚。</p>
<p>（三）踢毽子的技巧和名目</p>
<p>踢毽子的技巧分爲兩類，就是『八大』和『八小』。『八大』是用一隻脚踢而另一隻也同時離開地面的。『八小』也是用一隻脚踢而另一隻並不離開地面。後面的名目，我祇曉得牠的音，現在擇其音義相近的寫出，如有不對，乞閱者諸君指正。</p>
<p>『八大』</p>
<p>（一）摜（摜是八大中最易的一門。是用一隻脚在另一隻後面將毽踢高，兩脚須同時離地）</p>
<p>（二）跪　（將一隻脚屈成跪的形式在另一隻的腿　　灣中將毽踢高）（注意：並不是用屈着的脚踢）</p>
<p>（三）义　（將一隻脚的脚掌义在另一隻的腿灣的將毽踢高）（注意：同前）</p>
<p>（四）択　（將兩隻脚向前疊起，用下面一隻將毽踢高）</p>
<p>（五）　撇（用一隻將毽跨過，然後用另一隻將毽踢高）　（注意：毽在身前踢高，不是在身旁）</p>
<p>（六）過門慣（將毽跨過，動作同摜）</p>
<p>（七）過門跪（將毽跨過，動作同跪）</p>
<p>（八）過門义（將毽跨過，動作同义）</p>
<p>前四種相連呌『四大金剛』；八種相連呌『八大天王』；後三種相連呌『三過門』；摜</p>

<p>(Beiping) Okamura, together with Kita and others, left Tianjin for Changchun today. Regarding issues such as opening traffic and establishing customs, our side is organizing personnel from relevant competent authorities, together with specialists, to conduct research. After Xia Guangyu, a counselor from the Ministry of Railways, arrived in Beiping, he met with Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, several times. Our side's principle is that it can only be implemented under the conditions of avoiding relations with the puppet regime and not recognizing Manchukuo. This principle, after being drafted by the Beining Railway Bureau and submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval, was brought to Beiping by Xia to be discussed, revised, and implemented in consultation with the Political Readjustment Committee. Rumors that traffic between Beiping and Shenyang would open on December 1st seem premature. Regarding the establishment of customs along the Great Wall, the Ministry of Finance has dispatched Tax Commissioner Ding to Beiping to liaise and research the matter with the Political Readjustment Committee. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military authorities stationed in Tianjin announced today that Lieutenant General Okamura's visit to Beiping this time was to discuss with the Chinese authorities the post-剿 disposition for suppressing bandits in Funing and the method of receiving the area near Yuguan, and that the opinions of both China and Japan have been unanimous, and a satisfactory solution has been reached. (Eleventh Japanese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters announced that Chief of Staff Okamura met with Huang Fu and He Yingqin in Beiping regarding the receipt of the area near Shanhaiguan, which has been satisfactorily resolved. Chief of Staff Okamura is scheduled to return to Changchun on the morning of the 12th, it is said. (Eleventh Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xia Guangyu stated that regarding the opening of traffic between Beiping and Shenyang, our side has declared to the Japanese side that political relations cannot arise as a result of this, that is, the Japanese side cannot use the opening of traffic as a means for China to recognize the puppet state. The Political Readjustment Committee and the Beining authorities are proceeding according to this principle. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that regarding the negotiations with Japan on restoring traffic and postal services, the true situation is not entirely clear to me, but I believe that our country's diplomatic authorities should not violate President Wang's solemn pledge not to sign treaties that cede rights and humiliate the country. If we negotiate with the puppet organization to restore traffic and postal services, it would be tantamount to recognizing the puppet organization in fact. If we negotiate with Japan indirectly, it would be tantamount to recognizing Japan's sovereignty in the Eastern Provinces. I believe that the diplomatic authorities have long considered this carefully and should not only consider immediate interests without seeking a thorough solution to the loss of territory. He also said that we should insist that we will not engage in any negotiations unless the puppet organization is abolished, otherwise it would be a violation of the Kuomintang's foreign policy. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Okamura in Beiping, regarding the issue of restoring postal services in the Northeast, intends not to restore them, and that post offices in various parts of the Northeast can directly receive and send letters. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11:00 AM on the 11th, Okamura boarded a plane sent by the Kwantung Army to Dongjuzi and returned to Changchun to report. Chairman Yu's representative Chen Dongsheng, Japanese garrison commander Nakamura Ohashi, and others all came to the airport to see him off. Kita is scheduled to go to Yu on the night of the 11th at 11:20 PM, and then return to Changchun via Shenyang. (Eleventh Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A person from Chengde said that the Japanese troops stationed in Chengde and the Japanese troops stationed in Lengkou and Gubeikou were ordered by the Kwantung Army to conduct night combat and night communication drills from the 9th to the 15th of this month. Recently, the Japanese troops in various parts of Rehe have intensified air defense training, and the puppet troops are also actively training in night marches. The purpose is to develop night combat capabilities. When the officers gave instructions, they said that the current enemy of the Japanese and puppet troops is Soviet Russia because the Soviet air force can defeat Japan and Manchuria, so they are using night combat to eliminate the power of the Soviet air force.

<h3 id="e5">Talks on Inspecting Xinjiang: Sheng and Ma's Conflict Is Not a Struggle for the Country; Relying on Irredeemable Paper Money Is Extremely Harmful to Finances; Governing Xinjiang Must First End Military Affairs and Consolidate Finances; The Agreements Secretly Concluded by Jin Shuren Should Be Revoked <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan, a special envoy dispatched to inspect Xinjiang, arrived at Pukou at 8:00 AM on the 11th, and then took the Xin Jing small ferry across the river into the city. When Luo got off the car, Ai Sha and 16 other representatives of the Xinjiang populace stationed in the capital surrounded Luo and petitioned him. Ai Sha spoke with tears in his eyes. Luo replied that although he did not have a long time to inspect Xinjiang this time, he was fully aware of the past and present situation of Xinjiang. This time, upon returning to the capital, he will report all the information obtained during the inspection to the Central Government in detail, so that the Central Government can relieve the suffering of the Xinjiang populace as soon as possible. Those who returned with Luo from Xinjiang included Lin Donghai, a counselor from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Those who greeted and returned with him in Tanggu included Feng Youzhen, a secretary from the Ministry of Justice, and Yu Zhiang, a secretary from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Luo answered questions from guests: (1) He is unwilling to express his personal opinions on the plan to reorganize the new province before reporting to the Central Government. In short, governing Xinjiang is not an impossible task. The prerequisite is to end military affairs first, and then consolidate finances and develop transportation. Unless military affairs are stopped, everything cannot be started. With the vast territory and rich treasures of Xinjiang, it is no less than the four northeastern provinces. Unfortunately, since the founding of the Republic, the authorities have closed themselves off and imposed tyrannical policies, causing the people to be displaced, their houses turned to ashes, a desolate and tragic sight that I have only seen in my life. Since I arrived in Xinjiang, I have been appeasing the people and conveying the Central Government's intentions, while at the same time persuading all parties to maintain peace. However, the military is prone to chaos, and the war has been restarted. It is a pity to say the least. (2) The conflict between Sheng Shicai and Ma Zhongying is not a struggle for the country. When I left Xinjiang, Sheng once withdrew from the provincial capital. The situation after that has not been confirmed. If they continue to be obsessed, it will inevitably lead to the devastation of the entire territory. (3) The finances of the new province only rely on issuing irredeemable paper money to survive. Currently, one yuan of cash can be exchanged for seventy taels of paper money. Under such circumstances, the populace of the province still accepts and uses it and dares not resist. The sincerity of the people can be imagined. But if we think this is a good idea, then the entire province's economy will go bankrupt. The traffic between Xinjiang and the country is blocked, but it is extremely convenient with strong neighbors, so that commercial economy is controlled by foreigners. If we do not urgently develop the country, then the essence will be lost and the blood will be exhausted. (4) The situation of Jin Shuren's harm to Xinjiang has been disclosed in domestic newspapers. Now that he has been detained, we are waiting for him to be dealt with according to law. As for his agreement with the Soviet Union without the approval of the Central Government, it will of course not take effect. Therefore, the abolition of the agreement is not a problem. What we should pay attention to is how to plan for the safety of Xinjiang, the harmony of neighbors, and the welfare of the people after the abolition of the agreement. (5) Because I met with Ambassador Yan this time, and then the war in Xinjiang restarted, I returned to the country via Russia. During the hurried journey, I had no opportunity to study the political facilities of that country in detail. I only felt that the Soviet Union's construction has made great progress. Almost all the people in the country do not work and eat, and do not weave and wear. Everyone has a job, and everyone enjoys equal life. Corruption of officials is rare. The above is to talk about those who are detached from politics. (6) When I met with Ambassador Yan, he did not mention the intention to resign. I don't know the recent situation. The tense situation between Japan and Russia can be seen in domestic and foreign newspapers. When I left Vladivostok, I had seen the tense military atmosphere. The internal situation cannot be known because all actions of that country are extremely secretive. However, I think that to understand the true attitude of Soviet Russia, it is better to measure the tension and relaxation of diplomatic attitude than to observe military actions, because the soldiers of that country completely obey the diplomats. (8) I previously proposed to move the criminals to reclaim the northwest. This cannot be discussed at this time. Before there is a solution to the traffic problem, it is difficult to start. Luo did not say that I would meet with President Wang and then determine the date to go to Jiangxi. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan, accompanied by Feng Youzhen and Lin Donghai, returned to Beijing from Tianjin on the first express train on the Jinpu Railway at 8:00 AM on the 11th. More than 100 people, including Vice Minister Xu Mo, Vice Minister Zheng Daxishi Zhiquan, and important officials and newspaper reporters from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all welcomed him at Pukou. After Luo and others arrived at the station, they got off the car and shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one. Luo was wearing a black velvet leather cloak, which was more plump than when he left Beijing. Ai Sha and 16 other representatives of the Xinjiang populace also stepped forward to petition Luo, begging him to convey the suffering of the Xinjiang populace to the Central Government and to speak for them. Luo nodded frequently, indicating his approval. After Luo left the station, he boarded the Xinjing difference ship. The welcoming personnel, Chengping ship, crossed the river one after another. After docking, Luo and Feng Youzhen took car No. 418 and returned to their residence for rest. Wang immediately came to visit by car and went to Wang's residence No. 1 of the Ministry of Railways to talk until noon before returning to his residence. According to Luo, it has been three months since he left Beijing. He has seen and heard a lot during his long tour of the border provinces. Traffic in Xinjiang is blocked, the official administration is corrupt, and the populace is suffering. There is no way to complain. The new populace is simple and honest and extremely kind. However, the officials abused the people inhumanly, killing people in the fields and killing people in the cities. After the massacre, they falsely accused the populace of resisting. Almost all the prisoners are unjust cases. There is no law and no humanity. I now know the true meaning of the words freedom, equality, and fraternity. Luo said that the problem in Xinjiang is not in diplomacy, ethnicity, or economy. The crux of the problem lies only in the official administration, so it is easy to solve. However, the specific solution must wait until consulting with the government, and it cannot be announced now. Unfortunately, when I left Xinjiang, the war broke out again, so I took the Russian territory and returned to Beijing. I met Ambassador Yan in Russia and gathered for several days. It is inconvenient to announce whether the new Soviet agreement secretly signed by Jin Shuren and the Soviet Union has been cancelled, but completely rejecting trade with the Soviet Union is a suicidal policy. The reporter asked if his eye disease had been cured. Luo said that he had not seen electric lights for two months, so he had fully recovered, and his body had gradually become stronger. He did not seem to care about the hardships he had experienced along the way. After Luo met Wang, he would go to Jiangxi to visit Jiang in one or two days to report on the inspection. (Eleventh Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 11th, President Wang went to visit Luo Wengan at his private residence as soon as he arrived, and extensively comforted Luo for his hard work and remote visit to the border. Wang Luo and his party took a car to Wang's residence No. 1 of the Ministry of Railways and talked about the situation in the new province for as long as three hours. Wang decided to convene an informal meeting of central figures at 6:00 PM on the 12th to listen to Luo's inspection report and discuss the strategy for governing the new affairs. At 7:00 PM, a banquet was held for Luo at the official residence, accompanied by various important figures. On the evening of the 11th, Sun Ke hosted a banquet to wash away the dust for Luo, which did not end until after 9:00 PM. Luo is scheduled to go to Jiangxi in two or three days to visit Chairman Jiang and report on the process. (Eleventh Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan told a Central News Agency reporter on the 11th that in the past, Xinjiang was ruled by Yang Zengxin for seventeen years. He purely adopted a policy of closing off the country and fooling the people to consolidate his territory. However, he was good at adapting to changes, so throughout his life, Xinjiang was still peaceful. When Jin Shuren was in power, he wantonly oppressed the people and was extremely harsh. The people could not bear it, so an incident occurred in the 20th year. After the incident, Jin tried to obscure the Central Government and reduce his personal responsibility by saying that it was a dispute between the Hui and Han ethnic groups. After Jin fled in April of this year, Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai presided over military and political affairs and negotiated peace with Ma Zhongying. The war temporarily came to an end, but the entire southern Xinjiang was still in a chaotic and unclear state. I (Luo called himself) was ordered to inspect Xinjiang. First, I went to Hami to meet Prince Wang, then to Dihua to meet Liu Sheng, and then to Turpan to meet Ma Zhongying. Due to the years of unrest in various places, the houses were turned to ashes, the people were displaced, the finances were chaotic, the commerce was declining, and the economic power was controlled by others. The crisis was latent, and the situation was critical. I deeply felt that the first step in governing Xinjiang was to stop military affairs, maintain peace, and then gradually consolidate finances, develop transportation, reform politics, and rectify the official administration. With the wealth of treasures in the new province, there is a great future to be made. Therefore, I conveyed this intention to all parties wherever I went. The people were all moved, and the military and political authorities also expressed their sympathy. Then, after returning to Dihua from Turpan, I was about to send a representative back to Beijing to report to the Central Government in detail. However, Sheng Shicai was eager to solve the problem of the defense zone and suddenly detained the representative sent by Ma Zhongying and convened a military meeting to decide to attack Ma. At this point, I was unable to do anything, and the work fell short. It is a pity to say the least. After I left Dihua, Sheng led his troops to attack Ma, and the war restarted. When I arrived in Yili, I heard that Sheng was gradually unable to support himself. Recently, I heard that Sheng had retreated to Dihua. The outcome is still unknown, but no matter what the war is, it must be ended as soon as possible to reduce the suffering of the people and avoid other problems. After I personally visited various parts of Xinjiang, I felt that although the situation is chaotic now, it is not difficult to save. I have already prepared a plan and will report it to the Central Government for reference in detail. The wealth of treasures in the new province is not below that of the northeastern provinces. The Central Government should use all its strength to develop it. Once the war is over, we must pay attention to: (1) Strictly implement the rule of law so that the grievances of the people can be redressed and the officials can be restrained from acting recklessly and stop misunderstandings from causing various disputes; (2) Develop transportation. The road between Xinjiang and the mainland is obstructed, and transportation is inconvenient. In the past, freight was transported by camel. It took three to four months for the faster ones and one to two years for the slower ones from Tianjin to Dihua. After the incident occurred, it was completely cut off. On the contrary, transportation between Xinjiang and foreign countries is extremely convenient, so that all commerce is controlled by foreigners. If we do not urgently plan for development in the future, the essence will be lost and the blood will be exhausted, and if we do not destroy ourselves, we will be destroyed by others; (3) Consolidate finances. The finances of Xinjiang are extremely chaotic. There is no income at all. It is entirely supported by printing and issuing irredeemable paper money. In the past, there were only two types of this paper money, one tael and five taels. Every three taels are equivalent to one yuan of national currency. Now, ten tael notes and fifty tael notes have been added. Their value is that one yuan of national currency is already equivalent to seventy to eighty taels. According to what I recently heard, the provincial side is printing paper money not only to meet the demand but also to add to the paper of the paper money, which is also in short supply. If we do not urgently seek relief, what can we imagine in the future; (4) As for education, there is at most one primary school in each county, and most of them do not even have a primary school. As for diplomacy, local authorities can arbitrarily sign treaties that cede rights and humiliate the country with foreign countries. In short, there is nothing that does not need to be developed and consolidated. (Eleventh Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Prospects for the Settlement of Xinjiang <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Since Foreign Minister Luo Wengan's visit to Xinjiang, the internal problems seem to have come to an end. Diplomacy is also gradually becoming more moderate. Although the problems have not been resolved, judging from the surface, it will not expand again for the time being. However, if we carefully examine its content, it is not as easy to resolve as the optimists say, nor is it as hopeless as the pessimists say. In the past, China's governance of the border areas was based on a laissez-faire policy, with no specific plan. The central government only used a policy of restraint, requiring obedience was sufficient. In the border areas, they thought that the emperor was far away and they could do whatever they wanted, almost like an independent local emperor. Tibet was like this, Mongolia was like this, and even Xinjiang, even after it was changed to a province, was still like this. After Yang Zengxin fell and Jin Shuren fled from the new province, the political weaknesses were fully exposed and changes occurred. The religious conflicts became more and more intense. The history of Sheng Shicai and Liu Wenlong in Xinjiang is not yet deep. They only rely on the support of the Han people and foreign troops (such as the old troops of the Soviet Ma) to support their current situation. It seems that it is not easy. As for how to implement political measures, how to build up the economy, and how to communicate religious barriers, I am afraid that there is no preparation at this time. Therefore, Ma Zhongying's troops in Xinjiang can still take this opportunity to continue to cause disturbances.</p>
<p>The central government has twice sent senior officials to Xinjiang to have a more in-depth understanding of the core of the internal disputes in Xinjiang and the crux of the diplomatic problems. Before the specific measures for Xinjiang are distributed, we may as well offer some humble suggestions for the study of the people and to promote the attention of the authorities. First, if the current Xinjiang authorities still implement the political measures of Chang Jin and others, it will still not be enough to satisfy the hopes of the new people. How can they resolve the current disputes? Moreover, the north of the Tianshan Mountains was originally the center of national defense, and it is also a barren area. If there are no reliable measures to renew the previous state of decline, I am afraid that the alienated people will find it difficult to unite. Therefore, future governance must have a certain direction, and gradually progress according to local needs. For example, the popularization of education is the most important thing in today's Xinjiang. However, most of the Hui people in Xinjiang are unwilling to go to school, and some even destroy schools. If these prejudices are not eliminated, they will eventually become an obstacle to politics, and religious barriers will be more difficult to remove. Second, Xinjiang has abundant natural products. One is that transportation is difficult and difficult to develop. The other is that the peasant economy has just undergone transformation, and suddenly encountered political changes. It is even more difficult to reform the entrenched habits. Therefore, when it comes to development today, the first is to support the development of the agricultural economy, the second is to modernize livestock farming, the third is to develop transportation, and the fourth is to develop mining. Otherwise, without economic support, all measures will be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>The improvement of agricultural management is not only a problem in Xinjiang today. All parts of the country are in urgent need of it. However, the soil quality in Xinjiang is not as fertile as that of the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and the land is sparsely populated. Therefore, the management of intensive agriculture, which cannot be realized in the densely populated areas of the interior, is quite easy to implement in Xinjiang. As for livestock farming, whether it is cultivating livestock or shearing wool and making leather, the government must first carry out model management to allow the people to learn from it, and then engage in the wool weaving and leather making industries. Then the future of light industry will be very promising. Transportation problem.</p>
<p>Now the Western Air Route has been opened, and it seems very convenient to travel back and forth. However, this kind of convenience has great value in terms of politics and national defense, but the benefits to the general social economy are very small. After all, how many people can afford to take airplanes with Xinjiang's backward economic power? Heavy goods such as Hami melons, wool, and leather cannot be transported by airplanes. This is very obvious. Therefore, if we want to develop the new province, we must engage in the development of railways, so that we can shoulder heavy responsibilities and go far. Although the cost is high, the effect is very significant. The construction of automobile roads is more beneficial than airplanes, but it can only benefit military use. The benefits to the entire national economy are also small. Because our country cannot manufacture automobiles and does not produce gasoline. Moreover, automobiles cannot carry heavy loads. Our country produces coal and iron. Now we abandon our own coal and use foreign gasoline. It is also uneconomical for the development of the national economy. Therefore, the completion of the Longhai Railway, extending to Dihua, and then extending from Dihua to the north and south of Xinjiang, is the most urgent plan for Xinjiang's transportation policy. The most important mineral resources in Xinjiang are oil, followed by gold and jade. However, the exploitation of oil mines requires huge capital. If railway transportation is not fully utilized, it will be difficult to avoid empty talk if we want to exploit oil mines.</p>
<p>In short, to clean up the difficult situation in Xinjiang and develop its huge resources, we must first renew politics, eliminate the Han-Hui conflict, and resolve all internal contradictions. Then the vast land will not repeat the mistakes of the Northeast.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Hirota Advocates Peace and Moderation in Relations with Russia; Cites the Treaty of Portsmouth; Demands the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the official recognition of Soviet Russia by the United States, some believe that it is intended to contain Japan. The views of the Foreign Ministry on this matter are as follows: After the Five-Minister Conference, the Empire's policy toward Russia has been decided, focusing on peaceful international policies to ease relations between Japan and Russia. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the urgent task of the policy toward Russia is to promote the negotiations on the Middle East Railway, which have been stalled. At the same time, in order to avoid the danger caused by the concentration of Japanese-Manchukuo troops on the border, it is necessary to withdraw troops from the Russian-Manchurian border and stop military operations with each other. The Foreign Minister also stated that Japan and Russia had agreed in Article 9, Section 3 of the Treaty of Portsmouth after the Russo-Japanese War, which stated that "no fortresses or other military works shall be placed within the territory of Sakhalin Island at the 50th parallel and nearby islands," and also agreed that "no military measures shall be taken that would hinder the free navigation of the Soya Strait and the Tartar Strait." The spirit of this treaty can also be applied to the Russian-Manchurian border to eliminate military operations. Foreign Minister Hirota met with the Soviet Russian ambassador on the 6th and gave the above important hints. However, it is extremely important to pay attention to how Soviet Russia will respond to this. (Dentsu dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the United States is about to recognize its government, Soviet Russia is taking advantage of its international situation to show a challenging attitude toward Japan, and is also concentrating a large army on the eastern border to demonstrate. Moreover, on the 8th of this month, it protested against the intrusion of Japanese aircraft into its territory to suppress bandits, which was rejected by Foreign Minister Hirota. After these incidents continued to occur, relations between Japan and Russia deteriorated further. The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that the root cause of this is that the Soviet Union has concentrated an unnecessary large army on the Russian-Manchurian border. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota decided to demand from the Russian government within days that its border troops be withdrawn to a certain area. That is, the item in the Treaty of Portsmouth regarding the establishment of a demilitarized zone on the border, which has always regulated the relations between the two countries and is still strictly effective today. Therefore, no soldiers are stationed on the Japanese-Russian border (50 degrees north latitude) on Sakhalin Island, and only stone tablets indicating the boundary are present, which can fully ensure the safety of both sides. However, after Japan and Manchukuo signed a protocol, Japan assumed the heavy responsibility of maintaining the治安 of "Manchukuo." The Soviet Union secretly concentrated an unprecedented large army on the border of "Manchukuo" or the northwestern region of Korea, and built defensive works. This action by the Soviet Union violated the Treaty of Portsmouth. Japan therefore demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops. Foreign Minister Hirota also proposed this matter when he met with Russian Ambassador Yurenev on the 6th. However, the Soviet Union's arrogant attitude remained unchanged. Japan has been patient and self-respecting, waiting for it to wake up. However, Russia still disregards international faith and maintains its current attitude. It has therefore decided that it is necessary to take decisive measures and notify the Russian government. (Nippon Rengo dispatch on the 11th)</p>

The Manchukuo passport verification office has listed the facts of the victims and submitted them to Soviet Russia to urge it to reflect on its actions. If it still does not cancel the inspection, then all Russians passing through Manchuli must also be subjected to the same severe inspection, etc. Manchukuo has lodged a protest.

<p>Negotiations Progress Smoothly; No Obstacles Encountered</p>
<p>(Washington) According to official sources, the draft agreement for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia has been negotiated, and its content has been telegraphed to Moscow for approval. Today, Litvinov went to the White House to pay a visit to the US President and discussed for an hour or so. Although it was not possible to issue a statement recognizing Soviet Russia as expected, according to official sources, no serious obstacles occurred, and Litvinov had a smile on his face and told reporters that a joint statement would be issued soon. Then the White House did issue a statement, but it was still as vague as it had been, only saying that the President had discussed with Litvinov, the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner, the issues discussed by Litvinov and Secretary of State Hull a few days ago. Now Litvinov will continue to talk with Hull and the President through regular channels. It is heard that when Litvinov and the President began negotiations this afternoon, both sides had a draft agreement. It was later heard that Litvinov will stay at the White House at the end of the week, and will have another meeting with the President tonight. At this time, most US officials admit that the talks between the two sides are progressing smoothly, and all major issues have been resolved. (Komin News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt is scheduled to meet with Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov again at 7:00 pm on the 10th to discuss the issue of US recognition of Soviet Russia. According to White House sources, after tonight's meeting, there will probably be other meetings, and government officials will participate. The issue of recognizing Soviet Russia will not encounter any obstacles. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US President Roosevelt and Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov discussed the issue of resuming diplomatic relations last night at 9:00 pm. The decision had not been made by midnight, and it is likely that there will be another meeting soon. A joint statement was issued this morning, but it is expected that the next meeting will be on Sunday afternoon, because the White House said that no talks will be held on Saturday. Litvinov told reporters that he and the US President had a most pleasant conversation, but there were no results to be announced. US Assistant Secretary of State Bullitt also went to the White House during the talks, but he did not make any statement afterwards. According to those who claim to be close to the President and Litvinov, the negotiations are progressing smoothly, but it is still necessary to meet again to eliminate some points of contention. It has not been stated which issues have not been resolved, but according to all unofficial sources, they are not serious. The outside world was disappointed that the resumption of diplomatic relations could not be agreed upon at this afternoon's meeting, because this matter has become an important factor for the market and trade, and cotton merchants are especially eager to recognize Soviet Russia as soon as possible.

<p>(Tokyo) The US President's liquidation of the 16-year diplomatic rupture between the US and Russia, and the recognition of the Soviet Russian Federation, is almost certain. The Japanese Foreign Ministry observes its impact on the international community as follows: From a political point of view, the US's intention to recognize Soviet Russia is to attempt to equalize the power of European and American countries in the Far East. However, it is doubtful whether the US can realize this attempt. It is widely rumored that the US and Russia are cooperating to contain Japan, but this atmosphere is actually released by the Soviet Russian side. In reality, the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia has no substantial effect, but the extent of the agreement between the US and Russia and its impact are different. The most important thing to pay attention to is how many numbers the US will allow for Russian loans and the number of years of credit. This issue will begin to be discussed after the US recognizes Soviet Russia and exchanges ambassadors. (Nippon Rengo dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Paris) According to reliable information obtained by the French government, it has been confirmed that after Sunday's general election, Germany will propose to reorganize the Council of the League of Nations and amend the organization and regulations of the League of Nations as a basis for Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations. According to reliable information obtained by Reuters, although Italy may agree to this proposal, the French government will refuse to accept it. According to sources in Geneva, after Mussolini's talks with Goering, Germany will seek Italy's consent in advance to propose that countries related to the German issue, such as Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Belgium, and the Little Entente, hold a meeting in Switzerland before the end of this year, but not in Geneva. France may accept this kind of meeting, but on the condition that the resolutions of the meeting are subject to the decision of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Rome According to a semi-official statement issued here today, the responsible authorities in Italy believe that the time to re-discuss the issue of disarmament and withdrawal from the League of Nations has not yet come. In the letter from Hitler to Mussolini recently handed over by General Goering, there were no concrete proposals for the Disarmament Conference. The letter only explained the progress of the Disarmament Conference and explained Germany's reasons for withdrawing from the League of Nations. General Goering explained several points in Hitler's letter, but he himself did not make any suggestions or ask the Italian government to propose any events. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Rome The Italian Daily newspaper commented on the issue of disarmament, saying that since there is no possibility of Germany immediately returning to Geneva, a new diplomatic negotiation method should be sought for the issue of disarmament. The recent meeting between German Prussian Prime Minister Goering and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is the first action of an international nature after Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, which shows that there is still a possibility for countries to re-establish contact with each other. The newspaper concluded that although the environment is not safe, it is hoped that it will improve soon. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, some governments have advocated that the Disarmament Conference should continue to work and the Disarmament Convention should be established. However, the Italian government expressed opposition. The method decided by the six-person committee of the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference today proves that the countries advocating continued work have won. When the six-person committee of the Presidium met, the British representative always acted in concert with the French representative, and the representatives of the small countries also enthusiastically supported France. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The six-person committee of the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference met today and decided to submit the method of distributing and studying the British disarmament plan to the plenary session of the Presidium tomorrow for approval, and suggested the establishment of two committees. One is to study the issue of military quotas and the reform of the military systems of European countries, and the Soviet Russian representative is specially invited to participate. The other is to discuss the issue of arms and sanctions, and the Soviet Russian and Japanese representatives will be invited to participate. If the Presidium approves this proposal, six people will be appointed as rapporteurs to sort out the following issues: (1) Security issues, to be handled by Polis, the Greek Minister to France; (2) Czech Foreign Minister Benes to handle the issue of arms and the opening date of the Disarmament Conference; (3) Polish representative Komarnicki to handle the issue of arms and ammunition manufacturing; (4) British representative Cadogan (the new Minister to China) to handle the issue of the publication of military budgets; (5) Dutch representative Moraes-Goes to handle the naval issue; (6) Norwegian representative Lange to handle the aviation issue.

<p>Brussels Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans wanted to prevent Senator Toutoulou from publishing the secret report of the Allied Military Committee but failed. Some evening newspapers have already published summaries, but they are not causing the outside world to be as shocked as some had predicted. According to the summaries published, if they are true, they only want to show that Germany has not fully fulfilled the obligations of disarming within the treaty, and do not mention the quantity. Toutoulou also said that this report had been greatly modified by the Ambassadors' Conference to soften its tone before it was sent to the League of Nations, in order to prevent serious disputes from occurring. However, he had obtained a copy of the original report. As for his intention this time, he only wanted to express that Germany had not disarmed, and did not provide concrete evidence of Germany's breach of contract. The general impression here is that this action will not cause serious impact, because it had already been said that Germany had not completely disarmed, and at this time, the powers are trying to persuade Germany to return to the Disarmament Conference. Toutoulou's actions are also inconsistent with the policy of the powers, and their effectiveness is naturally minimal. (Komin News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Beijing Belgian Senator Toutoulou declared to the press today that Germany has absolutely not reduced its armaments in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. Toutoulou's statement is based on the last unpublished report of the Allied Military Administration Committee, which was secretly printed in Paris in 1927. This report is only held by each Allied government, and has 514 pages. It states the difficulties of the committee in managing Germany's armaments, and lists Germany's cunning methods of retaining its armaments and secretly manufacturing prohibited weapons in chemical factories, and claims that Germany did not comply with Article 5 of the Treaty of Versailles in 1927.

<p>(Berlin) Today, Chancellor Hitler, in his final campaign radio address on Siemens Radio, stated that Germany is still willing to befriend its former enemies, and that Germany's security is no more threatened than that of other countries. Why is it that other countries do not trust Germany? Has East Germany ever broken its word? We are prepared to participate in any international conference, participate in any negotiations, and sign any treaty, but only on the condition of equality. I will never allow Germany to be relegated to a second-class status. If other countries do not want to grant us equal status, then we should not associate with each other, etc. (Reuter, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) At 1:00 PM today, Chancellor Hitler delivered his final speech at the Siemens factory. The first part was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is the supplementary report of the second part: Hitler said that the current difficulties and hardships of Germany are entirely due to the Treaty of Versailles, and that the world economic panic is also due to various errors in international policy. The so-called international solidarity is just a theory. We must unite the various forces of the German nation to create a new German community. The nation cannot destroy itself through internal strife. We first unite all the German people to overcome general difficulties. The National Socialist Party is based on farmers and workers. The intellectual class has no courage to create such a community. Hitler then described the German government's recent war debts, and said that since he came to power, he has only had one intention, which is to heal the wounds that the Marxist policies have inflicted on Germany for the past fourteen years. We will try to remedy it and give credit and livelihood to the people. The new government will never exploit one class to benefit another. What it seeks is the welfare of all the German people. Hitler said that he deeply regretted that he could not clear up the damage caused by the improper actions of previous governments in one fell swoop. He then spoke of his four-year plan and foreign policy, saying that he had personally fought in the war and experienced its cruelty firsthand, which is contrary to the situation of some politicians. The German people only hope to work wholeheartedly in peace and are willing to join hands with enemy countries. The painful era of world history should now be brought to an end. Germany does not want to separate from other nations. All it seeks is to obtain equality of rights, because inequality is the most unbearable thing. So-called honor is the ability to enjoy equal rights. Germany does not want to be bound by treaties that are forcibly recognized. People often say that Germany cannot be trusted, but when has Germany ever broken its word? During the European War, if Germany had not been overly loyal to its allies, Germany would not have suffered such a bad fate. Germany is prepared to participate in all international work, but only on the condition of standing on an equal footing. Foreigners can always find sympathizers among the German nation, but "international vagrants" are not tolerated by Germany. After the election on November 12, foreign people should know that in the minds of the German people, there is only peace, honor, and equality of rights, because the survival of the German nation is something we must take into account, etc. (Havas)</p>

Hindenburg praised Hitler's courageous and vigorous active policies, and said that the principles that Germany wants to strive for in its national life are work and construction internally, and peace, honor, and equality externally. No one in Germany wants war. The German government is very willing to jointly and completely disarm with all countries. Germany withdrew from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations because it did not agree with the idea of applying different means to victorious and defeated countries. The people of the country should proclaim to the world the fact that Germany has been unified, etc. (Reuter, 11th)</p>

<p>Istanbul. The Soviet delegation led by Voroshilov left Istanbul for Odessa today. When the Turkish authorities saw them off, they showed friendship and continued the warm and friendly attitude that Turkish officials and people had shown to the delegation during their stay in Turkey. Representatives of the Turkish government accompanied the delegation to Odessa. The Soviet delegation's stay in Turkey was an important stage in the development of Soviet-Turkish relations. The delegation held responsible talks with Turkish leaders, which confirmed that the views of the two countries on the struggle for peace were completely consistent. Before leaving, Voroshilov made a statement to Turkish and foreign reporters, saying that this trip gave the delegates a clear understanding of Turkey, its people, and its leaders. Voroshilov added, "The Soviet delegation observed with particular deep concern the achievements of Turkey in the construction of schools, youth education, women's liberation, industrial development, and railway construction. The current economic progress shows that Turkey can also be economically independent." Voroshilov also expressed his firm belief that the cordial reception of the delegation by the Turkish people, as well as the close and friendly contacts greatly strengthened by this trip, would enable the people of both countries to strive for peace with greater strength. The cooperation between the Soviet Union and Turkey is not only of special value to the people of both countries, but also to all friends of peace. Turkish Prime Minister İsmet Pasha issued a statement one day before the delegation's departure, saying, "Our talks with the delegation have joyfully shown that Soviet-Turkish friendship is more reliable than before. When the Soviet delegation leaves Turkish territory, it is necessary to once again represent the Turkish government and express to the government of the friendly country our most friendly confidence. The memory of the delegation's stay in our country will be unforgettable for us." (TASS, 9th)</p>

<p>Havana. The Cuban San Martin government today admitted that the situation here is still serious, and civilians should stay indoors. At the same time, an American training ship is said to have sailed from Danba to the Cuban capital. However, the dispatch of warships by the United States is not the result of discussions on intervention in Washington, but is merely an action to protect overseas Chinese. Cuban President San Martin changed his mind and declared the country in a state of war yesterday, and today declared Havana in a state of siege, asking the people not to interfere rashly and to wait for the federal government army to use force to resolve the rebellion. The number of deaths and injuries is increasing daily. Today it was reported that 200 bodies had been found in the rubble from yesterday's battle at Fort Atair in the suburbs. Today, the government issued a proclamation with strict content, ordering the army to use all weapons to punish the rebellion, because in the past, the government army had not let go because it was afraid of accidentally hurting civilians. Therefore, after the issuance of this proclamation, the whole city suddenly felt panicked, and the people immediately obeyed the order to stay at home and throw themselves out.

<p>(New York) The US authorities today stipulated that the purchase price of domestically mined new gold is lower than the world gold price, so it can break the downward trend of the US dollar and limit its fluctuations to a very small range. The London foreign exchange market opened at a pre-war level of one pound sterling equal to five dollars and sixteen cents, but soon returned to five dollars and twelve cents. The decline in US bonds during the decline of the US dollar was caused by the Federal Reserve buying bonds in the open market every week, limited to ten million yuan. It is found that the Reserve Board used to take in bonds from 35 million yuan to 40 million yuan per week.

Zhu Jiaqi sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang, saying that the matter of the Eurasia Aviation Company's trial flight to Xining has been reported by telegram, and a reply has been received. According to Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, he was ordered by telegram to send a plane for a trial flight to Qinghai. On September 24, Li Jingcong took the opportunity to inspect the Northwest route and flew to Xishou from Lanzhou with Eurasia Plane No. 2, along the Yellow River and the Xishui River. The voyage took a total of one hour, and the weather along the way was not an obstacle. The Xining Airport is also said to be suitable. Regarding the plan to open air routes to Qinghai and Xining, he consulted with Chairman Ma Lin and Division Commander Ma Bufang of the Qinghai Provincial Government, who said that the automobile transportation between Lanzhou and Xining can now be reached in only one day. Sometimes, due to muddy roads, there are delays, but at most it will not exceed two days. Even ordinary mail between Lanzhou and Xining can be received in only three boats and six hours. As for passengers and goods between the inland, there has never been much, so the shipping of mail by air, which consumes a lot of resources, is not urgently needed, etc. Li Jingcong completed the contact and set off to fly back. It is found that the transportation between Lanzhou and Qinghai is very convenient, and the commerce between the two places is not very prosperous.

<h3 id="e47">Issue of Passport Verification for Foreign Passengers on Eurasia Aircraft <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Eurasia Aviation Company submitted to the Ministry, stating that the company's routes penetrate deep into the Northwest hinterland, especially since the opening of air routes to Dihua, the number of foreign passengers transported has been considerable. The company's sole purpose is to operate its business. Regarding foreign passengers going to the mainland, whether they should have passports or not, there has been a clear order, so it is inconvenient to overstep their authority and inquire. However, Xinjiang Province is located on the border and the situation is complex. In addition, it has recently been rumored that Britain, Russia, and Japan are all competing to instigate unrest in the province, causing the Chinese people to be motivated by patriotism and to be suspicious of the company every time it carries foreign passengers. For example, on the 6th of this month, a Shanghai newspaper widely published a Beijing dispatch stating that the company's plane carried Japanese military officers without passports to Lanzhou and Xinjiang, and the Xinjiang authorities telegraphed a request for their detention. The headline read in large characters, "Xinjiang Province Requests Detention of Eurasia Aircraft," implying that the company was negligent in paying attention to the foreign passengers' possession of passports, which was a mistake. Although this public opinion is inaccurate and speculative, it will inevitably affect the company's business prospects. In the future, whether foreign passengers going to the mainland should have their passports checked by the local authorities, or whether the company should also pay attention to whether they have passports, and whether all passports should be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be valid, so as to prevent risks and avoid blame, etc. The Ministry, believing that the matter concerns national defense and diplomacy, has consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification and reply, so that it can be instructed to comply.

<p>News from Peiping: Li Chunrun, Deputy Commander and Commander of the Sixth Route Army of the Liaoning People's Self-Defense Army, courtesy name Binpu, was 33 years old and a native of Fengcheng County, Liaoning. He was a graduate of the Beijing Army University, and was a patriotic and loyal man by nature. He served as an officer at various levels in the Northeast Army and participated in the anti-Russian war in 1929. After the September 18th Incident, Li was in Shenyang on official business and witnessed the true situation, becoming extremely indignant. He then fled back to the Eastern Border Defense Commissioner's Office in disguise and presented a plan for resistance against Japan to the Defense Commissioner Yu Zhishan. Because Yu had many concerns and did not adopt the plan, Li formed an alliance with comrades and waited for an opportunity. Soon after, he was transferred to serve as the commander of the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the Liaoning Army Infantry, where he was able to carry out anti-Japanese work. On April 29, 1932, he joined forces with Tang Juwu to launch an uprising in Xinbin County and was appointed as the commander of the Sixth Route Army of the Liaoning People's Self-Defense Army. He subsequently participated in battles in Xinbin, Qingyuan, Fushun, Benxi, Fengcheng, and Kuandian, leading his troops bravely and striking terror into the enemy's hearts. When Tang Juwu failed last winter, Li retreated to southern Liaoning. Together with Deng Tiemei, Liu Jingwen, and his younger brother Chunguang (Zirong), and other commanders, he attacked the puppet army of Li Shoushan at Dagushan. Feeling a shortage of artillery fire, he came to Peiping in December to request assistance. He originally intended to return to his defense post as soon as possible to continue the fight, but on his way through the Yellow Sea, he and his family of seven were almost harmed by the Japanese, drifting on the ocean for more than a month. After receiving a large number of weapons and ammunition from various national salvation organizations, the coast was already frozen, making transportation difficult. In January 1933, he was appointed by the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps of the Northeast Volunteer Army. He immediately sent a number of cadres and comrades back to the Northeast to prepare for an uprising. Unfortunately, in Benxi, Dalian, and other places, 20 people, including Brigade Commander Sun Yaozu, were arrested and killed one after another. Li was filled with anger and vowed to redouble his efforts. In June, he was reassigned as the Commander of the Tenth Military District. In July, he returned to his defense area in Fengcheng County in disguise. Subsequently, commanders of various routes organized the National Volunteer Army and elected Li as the Commander-in-Chief of Liaodong, actively implementing political work and reorganizing the volunteer army. In that month, when the weapons and ammunition were transported there, it attracted the attention of the Japanese and puppet authorities. The Japanese sent Commander Ban Jin of the Japanese garrison to launch a fierce suppression against Li. Li was determined and unyielding, vowing to resist to the death. From the end of July onward, he repeatedly fought fierce battles with the Japanese army, with the Red Flag Street battle on the 30th, the Xie Jialing battle on August 2nd, and the Tagou battle on the 17th being the most intense. More than one hundred Japanese officers and soldiers, including Major General Commander Xiao Bin, were killed. The Japanese side considered it an unprecedented and miserable defeat against the Liaodong Volunteer Army, so they changed to an encirclement tactic to suppress the Volunteer Army. Therefore, Li's unit also changed its deployment, ordering Deng to lead all of the Sixth and Seventh Infantry Regiments to Sitai, Fenghuangcheng, Gaolimen, and Tang Li Chunrun's posthumous portrait</p>
<p>Shancheng, and other places to carry out sabotage work, and assigned the squadron leader to clear out the Japanese and puppet garrison troops in the Shalisai Shaozihe area, hoping to contain the communist forces. The enemy also mobilized elite troops to firmly defend the southern Manchuria and Anfeng lines, with a force of more than a thousand men, divided into three columns, attacking the general reserve force of the Volunteer Army. At 8:00 AM on August 17th, 300 Japanese soldiers were discovered at Shajinchang. The General Reserve Force of the Volunteer Army, two companies of Ao's division, totaling about 100 men, and the headquarters guard company of over 200 men, immediately launched a counterattack after the special task force detected the enemy's situation. At about 10:00 AM, they engaged the Japanese army at Tagou for about two hours. The enemy sent three bombers and three fighter planes from Andong to bomb the main force of the Volunteer Army and used machine guns for continuous strafing. At the same time, more than 200 Japanese soldiers arrived from the Dabujiapu area. After fierce resistance by the Volunteer Army, at about 3:00 PM, Li personally led the guard company to attack the left flank of the enemy. The fighting was extremely fierce. Li led his troops to charge forward and was shot in the upper part of his left thigh. He was then wounded by a hand grenade thrown by a Japanese soldier. The wound was about three inches deep, with bone fractures and flesh flying, and blood flowing non-stop. Li Chunguang directed the troops to fight on one hand and sent people to rescue him down the mountain on the other hand, and sent him to a secret place for treatment. In this battle, the Volunteer Army suffered losses that broke the record of previous battles against the war. Battalion Commander Zheng Anjun, two adjutants, three company commanders, and eight soldiers were killed in action. Over ten officers and soldiers were wounded. Major General Commander Xiao Bin, Lieutenant Colonel Ito, Captains Nakamura and Ihara, and 57 soldiers were killed. The number of wounded on the Japanese side is unknown. The Japanese also considered it an unprecedented and miserable defeat in Liaoning after the September 18th Incident and built a monument to the loyal souls in Tagou to commemorate it. Li was treated in the sixth district of Fengcheng. However, he was frequently searched by the Japanese and puppet troops, causing him great anxiety and preventing him from recovering. He secretly ordered Division Commander Ao Chunyuan to act on his behalf as the Commander-in-Chief. On September 5th, his younger brother Chun Guang escorted him with eleven guards in disguise, and risked passing under a wanted order with a reward of 200,000 yuan on a fishing boat to the south. On the way, they encountered adverse winds and drifted on the ocean for eight days and nights, finally arriving in Shandong on the 12th for treatment. Li eagerly hoped to recover from his injuries and return to work, and resolutely requested Dr. □ of the hospital's surgical department to perform an amputation. After two hours of discussion, permission was finally granted, and he forced his younger brother to sign the consent form. It was scheduled to amputate the diseased limb the next morning. Li knew the danger and discussed the steps for future work and arrangements for his funeral with his brother on that day. He also had the following will: "My injury is deteriorating day by day. Although amputation is now performed, it is only for the sake of one in ten thousand. If there is any misfortune, the funeral should be simple and secret, and should not affect diplomacy. The atmosphere of aggression is getting more intense and the national crisis is not over. My brother and comrades must unite sincerely and continue to struggle for final success. Then I would have sacrificed for the country and the nation, what more could I regret? This is my wish." At around 10:00 AM on the 14th, he passed away less than an hour after the operation. Chun Guang and Li's staff member Zhang Wenhuan, and others, prepared for the aftermath. The body was placed in a coffin the next afternoon. Due to the limited environment, it was hurriedly buried in □□ Mountain. When the news of Li's death came out, everyone, whether they agreed or disagreed, was shocked and mourned. Since the September 18th Incident, such a heroic sacrifice was truly the only one of its kind since the Volunteer Army rose up in arms. As for his family members, due to his anti-Japanese activities, their houses were burned to ashes and their land was confiscated. Now, his family of seven is seeking refuge in Weihai. With an elderly mother and young children, the family is impoverished and their livelihood is extremely difficult.</p>

Zhang Also Goes to the Front Lines to Comfort the Armies <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch of the 9th: Central Committee member Zhang Ji brought an honorary banner to Jiangxi and awarded it to the Sixth Division, Thirty-Fourth Regiment. The banner is rectangular, about six feet high and three feet wide, with blue satin and white characters, yellow border and red tassels, embroidered with the words "Awarded by the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang," "Outstanding Achievements," "Thirty-Fourth Regiment of the Sixth Division of the National Revolutionary Army" on the left, and "October of the Republic of China, Year 22" on the right. Chairman Chiang, in accordance with the central government's award of merit, held a welcome ceremony for Zhang and an award ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 9th in the auditorium of the headquarters. Officers above the rank of school officer in the headquarters and officers of various military branches in the province attended in full military uniform. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech after the customary rituals, followed by Zhang's speech, which stated briefly: "At this critical time of internal and external troubles, we must first secure the country before resisting foreign aggression. The comrades in Jiangxi are fighting bravely against the Red bandits, doing the work of securing the country, and making heroic sacrifices. The central government is extremely concerned and is sending representatives to comfort and award them. I hope that you will take the courageous spirit of the Thirty-Fourth Regiment to eliminate the banditry and lay the foundation for the nation." Chiang's speech stated briefly: "The Thirty-Fourth Regiment, with a force of over a thousand men, resisted tens of thousands of bandits and fought for five days and nights, finally achieving victory. The merit is indeed great. Receiving an award and honorary banner from the central government is indeed a supreme honor. The central government has awarded the honorary banner once during the Huizhou campaign. It has been eight years since then, and this is the second time. Its glory is self-evident. To secure the country before resisting foreign aggression, all of our officers and soldiers must use a spirit of hardship and dedication to eliminate the communist bandits and complete the revolutionary cause, in order to repay the central government's special honor." The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>At 2:00 PM, people from all walks of life held a welcome meeting for Zhang Ji at the auditorium of the Provincial Party Department. Over a thousand people attended, including leaders of various organizations and representatives from all walks of life. Li Zhongxiang presided over the meeting. After the welcoming speech, Zhang delivered a speech, mainly: (1) Explaining the significance of the central government sending a representative to Jiangxi to award the prize; (2) Stating that China, under this internal and external attack, is like a sick person fighting with others. If the disease is not cured first, the punches will be weak and how can it win? Jiangxi's Red banditry is so serious that outsiders do not know its danger. Jiangxi should arouse national attention and make a concerted effort to eliminate the Red bandits. Eliminating the bandits is tantamount to defeating Japan; (3) Banditry originated in Hunan, and most of the bandit leaders are from Hunan. Why is Jiangxi a haven for them? Because the people of Jiangxi lack a strong intellectual class, most of them flee at the first sign of trouble, so the bandits become more rampant; (4) The non-resistance policies of Zhang Xueliang and Gandhi must be completely overthrown. We hope that everyone will arouse their spirits, unite, resist, and use their own strength to relieve their own suffering. The central government has unlimited determination to suppress the bandits. We must all understand this intention and go eliminate the Red bandits before we can fight against Japan." After the meeting adjourned, the People's Consultative Council held a tea party to entertain Zhang, attended by Ouyang Wu, Peng Chengwan, and dozens of others. Ouyang reported on all the efforts made by all sectors to help the government suppress the bandits. Zhang encouraged them greatly. It is reported that Zhang will go to the front lines with Chiang within days to inspect and comfort the various troops.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Political Dispute in Hubei Province, Provincial Party Department Requests Punishment of the Civil Affairs Director, Mediated by Central Inspectors <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>News from Hankou: Huang Danchu, the magistrate of Huangmei County, Hubei, was derelict in his duties and harmed the people. The county Party Department and various legal entities reported him. The case was referred by the Headquarters of the Three Provinces剿匪總司令部to the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government to notify their subordinates. After receiving the order, Civil Affairs Director Meng Guangchao immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital to post a notice. The Provincial Party Department believed that the wording was intentionally insulting to the Party Department, violating Party discipline, undermining the rules of political tutelage, and misinterpreting the orders of the headquarters. Therefore, it was submitted for discussion at a meeting on the 8th, and three measures were decided: (1) to submit a request to the Central Government and the Nanchang Military Affairs Commission to punish the Hubei Civil Affairs Director and report the handling of the case by the Party Department; (2) to telegraph the Central Organization Committee to investigate whether Meng Guangpeng, the Hubei Provincial Government Civil Affairs Director, is a party member; (3) to send a letter to the Provincial Government ordering the Civil Affairs Department to immediately withdraw the notice. These measures were implemented separately on the 9th. At that time, Meng Guangpeng was inspecting various counties. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun believed that the matter was a misunderstanding and should be explained urgently. It happened that Central Inspectors for the Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, Yu Xilai, arrived in Hankou from Jiangxi, and were appointed to mediate. It is reported that the following decisions were made: (1) The notice of the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital will be withdrawn; (2) The Provincial Government will punish Meng Guangpeng for dereliction of duty; (3) Huang Danchu, the magistrate of Huangmei County, will be dismissed from office. The situation will not be expanded. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Zhou Lisheng Impeaches Wuhan Mayor Wu Guozhen, Huangmei County Magistrate Also Impeached <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>News from Nanjing: The Control Yuan recently approved the cases of Control Committee member Zhou Lisheng impeaching Wuhan Mayor Wu Guozhen and Huangmei County Magistrate Huang Danchu. The impeachment documents are as follows, after being transferred to the Disciplinary Committee for review:</p>
<h3 id="e86">Impeachment of Wu Guozhen <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of impeachment: Upon investigation, Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen, due to a report in the Hankou Pioneer Newspaper titled "The Wealthy Love Peonies," believed it was related to him. He then arrested the newspaper's president, Chen Yi, and its editor, Wang Siyuan (also known as Wang Lianshen). They were initially detained at the Public Security Bureau and later sent to the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. The Headquarters, believing the matter was outside their jurisdiction, transferred them to the Hankou District Court. Chen Yi and Wang Lianshen then filed a complaint with the court. After investigation by a committee in Hankou, the facts were verified. According to Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution, people shall not be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished except in accordance with the law. Furthermore, the National Government and the Executive Yuan have repeatedly issued instructions that all military and political organs nationwide shall not arbitrarily arrest journalists. In this case, the news published by the Pioneer Newspaper did not contain the name Wu Guozhen. The Mayor should have been unconcerned. Even if the report was inaccurate, he should have ordered a correction in accordance with the Publishing Law. Even if he considered it damaging to his personal reputation, he should have filed a lawsuit with the relevant court in accordance with the law. The Mayor neither ordered the newspaper to make corrections in accordance with the Publishing Law, nor did he file a lawsuit in court in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. Instead, he abused his authority and made an arbitrary arrest, and instead of sending them to the court, he sent them to the Headquarters of the Three Provinces. Had the Headquarters not considered the matter unrelated to military affairs and refused to hear the case, the Mayor would not only have violated the law, but would also have placed the Headquarters in a position of violating the law. The Mayor's actions in suppressing public opinion and trampling on human rights are not only a dereliction of duty, but also a violation of the Provisional Constitution. Therefore, in accordance with Article 2 of the Impeachment Law, this impeachment is filed, requesting that Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen be handed over for disciplinary action to uphold the law and respect human rights. Respectfully submitted to President Ding, Supervisory Committee Member Zhou Lisheng.</p>
<p>Review Report, regarding the matter of reporting: The President assigned Committee Member Zhou Lisheng's impeachment case against Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen for abusing his power and arresting the president of the Hankou Pioneer Newspaper, Chen, and its editor, Wang En-yuan. After Committee Member Zhou personally investigated the facts in Hankou, the committee members also believed that Wu Guozhen suppressed public opinion and trampled on human rights, and should be transferred for disciplinary action to uphold the law. Respectfully submitted to President Yu, Supervisory Committee Members Gao Lu, Zhu Lei, Zhang Lishi, and Jun Li-shi.</p>
<p>Transfer for Disciplinary Action, regarding the matter of transfer: The Supervisory Committee Member Zhou Lisheng accused Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen of abusing his authority and making arbitrary arrests, etc. This case was assigned to Supervisory Committee Members Gao Lu, Zhu Lei, Zhang Lishi, and Li Shi-jun for review. Now, according to the report, it is believed that disciplinary action should be taken, etc. Accordingly, copies of the relevant documents are enclosed and transferred to your committee for verification and handling. This is to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, President Yu.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Impeachment of Huang Danchu <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of impeachment: Hubei Huangmei County Magistrate Huang Danchu has repeatedly been accused by the county's party headquarters and mass organizations of corruption, tyranny, illegal behavior, and harming the people. Supervisor Li Sheng was assigned to investigate the matter in passing while in Hubei. After arriving in Hubei, Li Sheng immediately inquired with the Hubei Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs. According to the Provincial Department, it had previously assigned staff member Luo Guolang to conduct an on-the-spot investigation in Huangmei County. The reply stated that the accusations against the county magistrate were mostly true. Moreover, when the investigator returned to the province, the county government secretary Wang Shijie and accountant Peng Fengzhou, representing the county magistrate, privately sent a package of banknotes to the investigator, hoping for protection, etc. Such corruption, tyranny, and public bribery not only tarnish official morality but also violate criminal law. Therefore, this impeachment is filed in accordance with the law, requesting that Hubei Huangmei County Magistrate Huang Danchu be handed over for disciplinary action. It is also requested that the Executive Yuan be consulted to order the Hubei Provincial Government to first dismiss the county magistrate from his post and hand him over to the court for custody, in order to deter corruption and preserve official conduct. Respectfully submitted to President Yu, Supervisory Committee Member Zhou Lisheng.</p>
<p>Review Report, regarding the matter of review: The President assigned Committee Member Zhou Lisheng's impeachment case against Hubei Huangmei County Magistrate Huang Danchu for corruption, tyranny, and illegal behavior. After careful review, it is believed that the county magistrate's illegal activities have already been verified by an investigation conducted by the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. This case should immediately transfer the impeached Huangmei County Magistrate Huang Danchu for disciplinary action to rectify official conduct. Respectfully submitted to President Yu, Supervisory Committee Members Shao Hongji, Cheng Yunpeng, and Gao Lu.</p>
<p>Transfer for Disciplinary Action, regarding the matter of transfer: Supervisory Committee Member Zhou Lisheng accused Hubei Huangmei County Magistrate Huang Danchu of corruption, tyranny, illegal behavior, and harming the people. This case was assigned to Supervisory Committee Members Shao Hongji, Cheng Yunpeng, and Gao Lu for review. Now, according to the report, it is believed that County Magistrate Huang Danchu should be transferred for disciplinary action, etc. Accordingly, copies of the relevant documents are enclosed and transferred to your committee for verification and handling. This is to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, President Yu.</p>

<p>Fushan, in this county, is located along the Yangtze River and was formerly an important military garrison. Therefore, military installations such as five cannon emplacements were established. However, they have recently been abandoned. During the January 28th Incident two years ago, the Fushan River mouth was also on the front line of defense. Therefore, the military deemed it necessary to preserve these cannon emplacements. After the war subsided, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent personnel to Changshu for inspection. They determined that the area where the emplacements were located was indeed important. Therefore, they strictly ordered the county government to protect them carefully. Now, the county has been ordered to plant forests in the surrounding open spaces of the emplacements to prevent enemy觊觎.</p>

<p>Due to the gun loss incident involving the former Chief Wang Xiezhong of the Second Branch Bureau of Public Security outside the Guangfu Gate in this county, Magistrate Yan suspended Wang from his post for investigation and appointed Fan Xinzhi, Chief of the Fourth Branch Bureau, to fill the vacancy. Xu Yi was appointed to fill Fan's vacancy. Both have already taken office. However, the county government did not report the transfer and appointment of Branch Bureau Chief Fan to the Department of Civil Affairs. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs has ordered Liu Zhuomin from Xinhua, Hunan, to come to Wuxi to serve as the Chief of the Second Branch Bureau and instructed the county government of this county to take note. After receiving the appointment, Liu came to Wuxi the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning (11th) at 10:00 AM, he visited both the County Magistrate and the Director of the Public Security Bureau to inquire about the date of taking office. Magistrate Yan instructed him to first forward the order from the Department to the Public Security Bureau for processing. As for the date of taking office, due to time constraints and the fact that tomorrow is Sunday, it would have to wait until the 13th. After receiving the instructions, the new Chief Liu was approved to take office on the 13th. It is also reported that Magistrate Yan will return Branch Bureau Chief Fan to the Fourth Branch Bureau, and Xu Yi will return to the county government to serve as the Director of the Guard Section in his original position.</p>

<p>The Yang Hongtai Bamboo Shop at the Jitou of the Lime Yard outside the North Gate, opened by Yang Sanbao, has been in business for over twenty years and is relatively prosperous. Because Yang is old and frail, he handed over the shop's affairs to his eldest son, Jinlong. Jinlong has five children. The two eldest sons are adults. The youngest son, Wu Bao, is only eight years old, very intelligent, and currently attends Chongshi Elementary School nearby. More than ten members of the family and shop employees lived in the back of the shop. Tragically, around midnight the night before last, a fire suddenly broke out in the bedroom at the back. Upon hearing the alarm, Jinlong immediately rescued his father Sanbao, his mother, his wife, and others. His youngest son, Wu Bao, was also in the room upstairs, crying loudly and screaming for help. However, the fire was too fierce to be rescued. After fire brigades from nearby sections drove the dragon to the scene to extinguish the fire, Wu Bao had already died in the fire. After burning for half an hour, the fire was extinguished. All the shop's buildings were destroyed, with estimated losses of over one thousand yuan. It is reported that Wu Bao suffered from eye disease and lost the use of his eyes during the fire, unable to find a window, which led to him dying in the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Request to Reduce Education Grain Tax <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Jiaxing education authorities, due to a lack of funds for rural education, requested and were approved by the provincial government to collect a grain tax on fields to supplement the funding. The method is to collect two catties of grain per mu, calculated at a current market price of 2.5 cents per catty, i.e., 5 cents per mu. The county magistrate will order the township offices to collect and remit the funds. Currently, the township offices believe that the rural economy is collapsing and that farmers cannot bear the burden of the grain tax. They have filed requests for exemption. Therefore, although the early rice harvest has already begun, the tax has not been collected. It is learned that the education authorities are aware of this and plan to reduce the tax by half, collecting 2.5 cents per mu. The request is currently under review by the province. As soon as approval is granted, collection will begin.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the National Government yesterday, stating: "To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing National Government: Negotiations with Japan have created doubts and caused damage. The people of the whole country are feeling anxious. We recently read Premier Wang's report to the Legislative Yuan stating that our side has decided not to sacrifice sovereignty as a principle. After reading this, we felt extremely gratified. The Four Northeastern Provinces are Chinese territory, this is a major matter of sovereignty. The people will never be willing to abandon them under any circumstances. In the past, during the European War, the entire territory of Belgium was devastated, but they never yielded and eventually recovered their original territory. Moreover, the League of Nations resolution and the sympathy of friendly nations provide guarantees. How can we abandon it ourselves? We earnestly request that the central government consistently adhere to the principle of not harming sovereignty, thereby fulfilling the expectations of the whole country and avoiding unforeseen outcomes.

If the Four Provinces can be forfeited, it is tantamount to wasting all the sacrifices of the people over the past two years. How can we protect the country and bind the hearts of the people? Negotiations between China and Japan are extremely difficult. But no matter what, we dare to ask you to devise other appropriate measures to cope with the situation, so as to comfort the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and fulfill the hopes of the people.

<h3 id="e116">Cotton Industry Control Committee Announces the Process of Stabilizing the Yarn Market. Banks in China and Shanghai Advance Funds. Organization of He Xing Company to Purchase and Stock Yarn. All Measures are to Rescue the Cotton Industry. <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The New News reporter recently visited the officials of the Cotton Industry Control Committee after the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange resumed operations after its suspension. They asked the officials about the truth of the committee's stabilization of yarn prices. The person in charge explained in detail: "Since the establishment of the committee under orders to control the cotton industry, the basic and temporary solutions have been carefully discussed before being implemented step by step. Recently, in view of the sluggish yarn sales, which is the biggest pain for manufacturers, it is necessary to make adjustments. Over the past two weeks, we have dealt with the matter fairly, with the sole purpose of maintaining the yarn industry and taking into account the interests of the majority of the people. We have heard rumors, which are not credible. Here is a detailed account of what happened":</p>
<h3 id="e117">Reasons for Stabilizing Cotton Yarn Prices <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of its establishment, this association received an official letter from the Ministry of Finance, which stated that the Taxation Administration had reported that, according to the United Association of Chinese Cotton Mills, the recent decline in cotton mill business was mainly due to the excessive amount of cotton yarn stored in the Cotton Yarn Exchange, which had led to a sharp drop in yarn prices. They proposed that the government should invest funds to purchase 30,000 bales of cotton yarn stored in the exchange to slightly increase yarn prices and maintain the cotton industry. It was confirmed that the recent decline in yarn prices was a fact. If no measures were taken to provide relief, it was feared that the prices would continue to fall, further affecting the only important domestic enterprise. As your committee has been organized and established, we hereby forward the letter to your association, hoping that you will promptly investigate the actual reasons for the drop in yarn prices and discuss relief measures within a possible scope to maintain the cotton industry. This association, upon receiving the letter, held several meetings of the Standing Committee. It was generally agreed that although there were multiple reasons for the drop in yarn prices, the massive amount of cotton yarn stored in the exchange was the crux of the matter. Therefore, it was resolved that this association should urge manufacturers to organize a company to purchase the stored yarn as much as possible and distribute it to various regions for sales, as a fundamental solution. This is the method adopted by this association to facilitate the clearance of stored yarn.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Organizing a Company for Bank Loans <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>To purchase the stored yarn, a suitable company was required. Therefore, this association invited enthusiastic manufacturers to form the He Xing Company, which would serve as the organization for purchasing the stored yarn. This association was well aware that this stored yarn was of low quality and had to be sold at reduced prices, which would inevitably result in significant losses in the future. This association has already sent a letter to the government requesting subsidies to offset the losses. Since the middle of last month, purchases have been made successively. By the end of last month, He Xing Company had purchased a total of 21,150 pieces of yarn. The final settlement for the month required a net amount of 4,073,067 yuan. This association negotiated with six banks, including China, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings, Continental, Zhejiang Industrial, National Goods, and Women's Bank, as well as three money shops, including Yongfeng, Hengxun, and Fuyuan, to provide loans on a pro rata basis.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Deciding on Three Rectification Measures <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Our country's exchange receives cotton yarn based on trademarks, not on quality standards. This allows manufacturers to take advantage of the opportunity to produce low-quality cotton yarn specifically for delivery to the exchange, further providing speculators with opportunities for dumping. This association has repeatedly discussed and decided on the following measures: (1) Notify the Cotton Mill Association to inform all factories to strictly abide by the resolution of the association on July 8, that no cotton yarn will be delivered to the exchange from that date until the end of this year. (2) Notify the Cotton Yarn Exchange that, starting from October, all delivered cotton yarn shall be subject to quality inspection by personnel dispatched by this association to prevent inferior yarn from entering the exchange. (3) Work with the exchange to revise cotton standards and inspection regulations to provide a basis for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Course of the Exchange Suspension <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Of the cotton yarn purchased by He Xing Company, apart from the majority being yarn stored in the exchange's warehouses, 7,200 pieces were found to be newly delivered goods by the seller, which was inconsistent with the resolution of the Cotton Mill Association on July 8. This association, considering that the resolution of the meeting had not been implemented and that there was a lack of good faith, and that the new standards would not be implemented until six months later, while the current standard yarn was of low quality and its validity period was only two months, requested the Ministry of Industry to instruct the exchange to refuse to receive newly delivered cotton yarn from November to the end of December. After receiving the order, the exchange immediately announced its implementation. However, the brokers became concerned and stopped trading. The exchange had no choice but to announce a three-day suspension of trading from the 6th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e121">All Measures to Rescue the Cotton Industry <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>This association believes that the actions of the exchange's brokers were due to a misunderstanding of the intentions of the Ministry of Industry and this association. Since the purpose of He Xing Company's purchase of goods is to stabilize yarn prices, the cotton yarn purchased is mainly intended for distribution to various ports. Even if the market price rises excessively, before the stock purchased by He Xing Company is sold out, this association can still order it to be released in appropriate quantities for regulation. To protect the business of the exchange, this association is willing to provide sincere assistance to the various rectifications of the exchange. Now that the exchange has also understood this intention and has resumed cotton yarn trading, with prices returning to stability, this association expresses its satisfaction. In summary, the Ministry of Industry and this association, for the sake of stabilizing cotton yarn market prices, have taken all measures to rescue the cotton industry from its crisis, which is beneficial to the yarn market. Those who are insightful will share this view.</p>

<p>Qi Zhanjiu, the Commander-in-Chief of the Liaoning National Salvation Army, yesterday sent his Chief of Staff, Sun Yunwu, and his representative in Shanghai, Dou E, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association to request assistance. They also carried an official letter, which stated: "Respectfully, since I came to Shanghai this time, I have received various favors from your esteemed association, and my gratitude has never been forgotten. Since returning to the defense, I have greatly reorganized the troops, selecting the elite, eliminating the old and weak, and reorganizing them into four brigades, totaling more than 16,000 people. The equipment is extremely complete, with more than 8,000 horses. Since summer, there has been considerable development. The details of all the previous work have been recorded in detail in the domestic newspapers, which I hope you will be aware of. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the late crops of the people have been successively harvested, and natural cover has been lost. Ammunition is also lacking, so we have to temporarily retreat to the mountains and forests to preserve our strength and wait for the opportunity. However, the deep mountains and ancient mountains have suddenly increased by more than 10,000 horses and men, and the people's supply is suddenly difficult. For two years, the warriors who have shed blood on the battlefield, even if they do not sacrifice under the enemy's artillery fire, will mostly starve to death in the desolate mountains and deep forests. After thinking about it, I had to come to Shanghai to appeal for assistance. I believe that your association's patriotic enthusiasm is admired by all over the world, and that your assistance to the volunteer army has never lagged behind. This spirit is moving. However, my subordinates are also anti-Japanese volunteers. I think you all must have planned well in advance for the assistance. Therefore, I have come to seek assistance without hesitation, and I sincerely hope to provide extensive relief and save these more than 10,000 soldiers from danger. I am so anxious that I cannot wait for your orders."</p>

In addition to distributing them, they should be complied with and communicated to the subordinates to comply with them. This order,</p>
<h3 id="e129">Provisional Measures <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>

The work was completed the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a test flight was conducted at the Hongqiao Airport. It is planned to depart from Shanghai within this week, passing through Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and arriving at Xiamen, and then fly to the South at a later date.</p>

<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Jiangfeng aircraft was transported from the Gao Miao Aircraft Manufacturing Office to the Hongqiao Airport. Director Zeng Yijing, engineers Ma Deshu and Wang Chonghong, and others went to the airport in advance to make arrangements. The Jiangfeng aircraft was escorted by pilot Xu Chengqi. It arrived at the airport at 10:30 AM. Xu Chengqi piloted the aircraft and took off at 11:30 AM. When it was taxiing on the ground preparing for takeoff, it was temporarily suspended because the land wheels leaked air.</p>

<p>After inspection by engineers Wang Chonghong and others, it was found that the air pressure in the land wheels was insufficient and needed to be reinstalled. However, since the parts were all in the manufacturing office, the Jiangfeng aircraft was transported back to the manufacturing office at 1:00 PM to be repaired. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met Director Zeng last night. According to him, the reassembly of the land wheels on the Jiangfeng aircraft will be completed soon. As for the date of the flight to South China, it will be determined after the work is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Sixth Day of the Bandit Suppression Propaganda Week. Yesterday Afternoon, a Motorcade Paraded in Nanshi. Mayor Wu Broadcast a Speech Yesterday. <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The city's bandit suppression propaganda campaign entered its sixth day yesterday, which was Motorcade Day. More than 80 vehicles and 50 bicycles participated in the motorcade. The route was originally planned to start from Heping Road in Ximen, pass through the concessions, and end in the city center. However, as a result of the negotiations between the city party headquarters and the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, it was believed that at a time when the Communist Party was lurking in the concessions, it might cause trouble. The motorcade was not allowed to pass through. Therefore, the standing committee meeting of the city party headquarters yesterday decided that the motorcade route would start from Heping Road in Ximen, circle the city, and end at Heping Road again. Several large oil painting banners were hung on the cars, and party flags and large white cloth banners were inserted and hung on each car. The Public Security Bureau sent a military band to liven things up, and there were also eight patrol cars to maintain order. Mayor Wu also broadcast a speech for the Bandit Suppression Propaganda Week, entitled "The Bandit Suppression Work and the Prosperity of Shanghai." His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Serious Significance This city is holding a bandit suppression propaganda week today. As the head of this city, I would like to use the topic "The Bandit Suppression Work and the Prosperity of Shanghai" to explain the serious significance of the bandit suppression work, so that all citizens can deeply understand the tragic nature of the bandit disaster in China today, rise up together, support this serious and arduous work, and jointly eliminate this bandit scourge that harms the people and the country.</p>
<p>Scorched Earth Policy Since the Chinese Communist Party decided on its "scorched earth policy" at the so-called "August 7" meeting (emergency meeting on August 7, 1927), the people in the bandit areas have been living under the lewd power of the Red Bandits and groaning in the depths of the water and fire for six years. Except for a few scholars and scholars who live comfortably in the city, live comfortably, and watch the fire from the other side, they are still chewing their pens and sucking their ink, talking and arguing, and criticizing the bandit suppression, almost all citizens who have a little blood and a little responsibility deeply hate the tragic nature of the bandit disaster and earnestly hope that the Red Disaster will be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unprecedented According to a telegram from Chairman Chiang, the bandit areas in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei are all like poor borderlands, and everything has been swept away. There are no houses that have not been burned, no trees that have not been felled, no chickens and dogs that have been left behind, and no cattle that have not been killed. Only the cries of the wild are heard, and no smoke from the cooking fires can be seen. In some cases, thousands or even tens of thousands of people prostrate themselves before the army, with emaciated faces and bodies, and lie stiffly on the left side of the road. The tragedy is unprecedented. According to the statistics of the bandit areas investigated by the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, only Shangcheng County, with a population of 350,000, has been captured by bandits, and only two-fifths of the county's area has been affected. The number of people killed has reached 10,000, and the number of refugees has reached 107,000. The total number of refugees and people killed accounts for half of the total population. 343,000 houses have been burned down, 150,000 heads of livestock have been lost, and the loss of property can be estimated at 10 million yuan. The area of ​​farmland that has been abandoned accounts for more than six-tenths of the county's area. According to the statistics of Shangcheng County alone, the losses are so alarming. If we combine the statistics of all the bandit areas, the losses and disasters to the nation, the country, the society, and the economy are beyond calculation. If this disaster is not eliminated and this scourge is not eradicated, how can the country stand and how can the people survive?</p>
<p>The Disease Is in the Abdomen Examining the history and studying the reasons for order and disorder, it is inevitable that a great chaos will follow a famine. At a time when bandit disasters are rampant and disasters are coming together, and dangerous situations are emerging one after another, all Chinese people, if they do not rise up together to eliminate this scourge that harms the country and the people, will inevitably suffer the great disaster of the entire people being overthrown. On July 30 this year, Premier Wang and Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to inform the people of the country, saying that the way to save the country today is to enrich the national strength, and the way to treat the symptoms is to clear the Communist bandits. If the national strength is not strong, it is because the people's strength is not sufficient. If the people's strength is not sufficient, it is because the rural areas are bankrupt and the industry is immature. Therefore, the business is invisibly declining. If we give up the development of the national productivity, there is no other way to enrich the national strength. The bandits are rampant, and the disease is in the abdomen. The red flames are full of the world, and people are reduced to animals. If they are not suppressed, not only will the people have no peace and happiness to speak of, but all plans will be constrained, and even defending the country and resisting foreign aggression will not be effectively implemented. The Central Committee is concerned about this, so it has concentrated its troops and carefully suppressed the bandits in order to clear the bandit disaster in the shortest possible time and eliminate the greatest hidden danger to this nation and country.</p>
<p>Closely Related Although Shanghai is the richest area in the country, its prosperity is also based on the internal security of the country. I have often said that Shanghai is like a fish and the inland is like water. In recent years, although the population and wealth of Shanghai have increased greatly, and there seems to be a trend of development and prosperity, the communist bandits in the inland provinces have caused rural bankruptcy, and wealthy families have flocked to Shanghai with their money and property to seek security, while the farmers who are struggling to make a living have also come here to solve their livelihood problems.</p>
<p>However, it is not known that the concentration of wealth without knowing how to circulate it is not a sign of urban prosperity. The increase in population and the increasing number of unemployed people is a pathological condition of urban life. It is impossible to expect a fish to grow without first filling the pond with water. Therefore, today's bandit suppression work, although it is directly aimed at seeking the safety of the people in the inland and the recovery of the rural economy, is indirectly aimed at promoting the development and prosperity of Shanghai. The inland and Shanghai are not only closely related like lips and teeth, but also like fish and water. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai, although living in this rich and happy environment, should think more about the suffering of the inland people and the hardships of being displaced. At a time when we are actively suppressing the communist bandits, we should unite and do our best to help the progress of the bandit suppression work.</p>
<p>Beware of Disregard Alas, the tragic disasters of the late Ming Dynasty are not far away. Thinking of danger in times of peace, beware of disregard. A spark can set a prairie fire, and a bandit disaster can destroy a country. I urge all citizens to rise up together and swear to eliminate this hidden danger to the nation's heart and abdomen in order to save this nation from the great disaster of destruction.</p>

The text of the document is as follows: "It has been found that the city's taxes have been owed for many years. Orders have been issued repeatedly to urge the collection of taxes.

It is necessary to issue a strict order to the tax collection police chief to instruct all tax collection police officers to comply with the order and clear all taxes owed up to the 20th year of the Republic by the end of November this year. As for the 28th, 29th, and 30th guarantees, the situation is special, and each should pay at least 10,000 yuan within the deadline.

<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office received an official telegram from Tokyo yesterday. In October of this year, the total value of Japanese exports was 170 million Japanese yen, exceeding the total value of imports by 30 million Japanese yen. All major exports, except for raw silk, are satisfactory. As for imports, cotton, wool, iron, and kerosene are all large amounts. Therefore, the total foreign trade for the ten months of this year is still in deficit by 38 million Japanese yen. However, the deficit has decreased by 42% compared to the same period last year. Also, when the foreign trade of Japan and its colonies is combined, the deficit for the nine months of this year is also 38 million Japanese yen, which is a decrease of 27% compared to the deficit for the same period last year. Also, in September of this year, Japanese exports to China were worth 11.3 million Japanese yen, exceeding imports by 1.5 million Japanese yen. The total surplus for the nine months of this year is 21 million Japanese yen, but the surplus has decreased by 65% compared to the same period last year. If we divide it by region, Japanese exports to South China decreased by 55% in September, exports to North China decreased by 26%, exports to Central China decreased by 4%, and exports to Hong Kong increased by 1%. As for the amount of Japanese imports to Central China and South China, the value is also very large.</p>

<p>Dagon Society reports that there are over 320 rickshaw pullers in Dongjiadu, Pudong. These pullers rent vehicles from rickshaw companies daily, and after paying the rental fee, they rely on the remaining earnings to make a living. Because these pullers have no specific employer to address, disputes have never occurred. Unexpectedly, starting at 7:00 AM yesterday, dozens of pullers suddenly parked their rickshaws in vacant lots and declared a strike. However, some who had not joined the strike continued to pull their rickshaws. These striking members then blocked them along the way and ordered them to join. By a little after 8:00 AM, all 300+ rickshaws were at a standstill. A Dagon Society reporter inquired with the pullers about the reason for the strike, but all responded that they did not know. However, according to another source, it was said to be due to incitement by reactionary elements.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Association held its 12th General Meeting of Members at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Ningbo Native Place Association Auditorium on Xizang Road. Over 300 people attended, including representatives from party and government agencies, academic groups, and association members.

<p>After the meeting was opened with a bell and formalities were observed, Lu Shie, chairman of the association's presidium, delivered a speech. He was followed by Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, who said, "I attended your association's general meeting last year, and I am very honored to attend again this year. Our country is facing increasing foreign aggression, and domestic natural disasters and man-made calamities are successive and harmful, creating dangerous situations. This has led to the continuous invasion of our economy and culture, causing all industries and businesses to lag behind. If we can build the country academically, we will surely become strong. However, our country's inherent academic traditions have lacked connection in the past for exploration and research. Therefore, although we have a history of thousands of years, we have failed to promote and develop it. On the one hand, we were also subject to the political forces of the feudal era and could not organize groups for joint research. Now, times have changed, and the government needs the people to unite to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and effort. Externally, we can concentrate our strength, and internally, we can unite. Academically, we can promote and develop our traditions. Your association, as an academic union, bears the mission of promoting national medicine. I hope that you will research and improve the academic traditions of national medicine in order to promote and develop them in the country and extend them to the world. This will not only bring happiness to mankind, but our Chinese nation will also be fortunate." Zhao Jinghui from the Health Bureau, Lü Hailan from the Education Bureau, Jiang Wenfang from the Shanghai National Medicine Association, Cheng Diren from the Shenzhou National Medicine Association, Guo Boliang from the Chinese National Medicine Association, Bao Tianbai from the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, and others then gave speeches one after another.

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications issued a notice to users yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern: Since the integration of Chinese and foreign call charges into the monthly rental, the daily number of calls has increased from 4,000 to 12,000, causing abnormal congestion on the bureau's lines and heavy workload for the traffic bureau. We are currently trying to expand our capacity, but all mechanical equipment must be ordered from abroad, which will take about three months. During this time, due to line limitations, new user installation requests cannot be processed immediately. The bureau is therefore incurring losses and additional subsidies, but to facilitate users, we should temporarily endure the pain. However, we hope that valued users will, to the extent possible, reduce the number of calls as much as possible, so that public convenience can be taken into account. We have always admired your enthusiasm and care, and we are making a suggestion. Please take it to heart. We are sincerely grateful.

<p>The Shanghai YWCA on Yuanmingyuan Road, in view of the fact that the people's use of domestic goods is a national concern, and the First Inspection Customs report shows that the surplus of imports is increasing day by day, partly due to the lack of sufficient domestic goods to meet needs, and partly due to the lack of promotion and guidance, has specifically scheduled a National Goods Exhibition at the YWCA on Yuanmingyuan Road on December 14, 15, and 16 to promote and fulfill the responsibility of guidance. The exhibition will focus exclusively on utilizing the products of domestic goods factories, meticulously researching and applying them to practical use according to the budget, such as arranging a model domestic goods family to resist foreign goods and support domestic goods factories intangibly, holding "Children's National Goods Clothing Competition" to cultivate children's habits of using domestic goods, "Women's National Goods Clothing Show" to dispel psychological barriers to viewing and adopting domestic goods, "Collecting samples from various factories" to distribute to guests to facilitate recognition and avoid the disadvantages of passing off fish eyes as pearls, and initiating a "Speech Competition" for students from various primary and secondary schools, entitled "How to make the public happy to use domestic goods," hoping that the people of the whole country will work together with one heart and one mind to save the country from danger. In short, attention is paid to the use of domestic goods everywhere, unlike store-style domestic goods exhibitions, which are full of domestic goods and leave people unsure how to use them. It is reported that the director of the preparatory committee is Mrs. Yu Yingjie and Mrs. Song Zhezun. The exhibition is divided into a display department, with Mrs. Wang Zhengxu and Mrs. Yu Yingjie as the directors, a "Game Department" with Mrs. Cao Chentao and Mrs. Zhang Fuliang as the directors, a "Recreation Department" with Mrs. He Linyi and Mrs. Mei Huaquan as the directors, a "Food Department" with Mrs. Chen Liting and Ms. Zhou Cuiying as the directors, a "Gift Department" with Mrs. Song Xingchun and Ms. Xia Mali as the directors, an "Advertising Department" with Mrs. Yu Yingjie and Mrs. Jin Longzhang as the directors, and "Arrangement" with Mrs. Zheng Xiangheng. The international branch's "General Affairs" are handled by Mrs. Jin Longzhang and Mrs. Chen Jianan, "Reception" is handled by Mrs. Mei Huaquan and Mrs. Wang Zhengxu, and "Ticket Sales" are handled by Ms. Zhou Cuiying, Mrs. Chen Liting, and Ms. Lu Deyin. The international branch is currently proceeding separately. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will assist.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Animal Protection Association Seeks Members <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yiting, Ye Yufu, Guan Jiongzhi, and others have initiated the China Animal Protection Association and are seeking members. Their solicitation announcement states: "The human massacre of animals is, in fact, a matter of the strong bullying the weak, which is contrary to righteousness. In ancient Chinese etiquette, there was a provision against killing without reason. In modern times, foreign countries have associations prohibiting mistreatment. Although it may not be possible to immediately stop killing, it is still possible to reduce it. This is well known to all gentlemen. In the past, Ms. Lü Bicheng compiled "The Light of Europe and America," which included an article on the origins of creating an animal protection association, marking the beginning of the animal protection movement in China. The cause of planting cruelty is the cause of creating the disaster of war. Therefore, whether or not world wars can be eliminated depends not on international agreements, but on the compassion and violence in people's hearts. Overcoming cruelty and eliminating killing cannot be achieved by chance. This is why the progress of this association cannot be delayed. We believe that everyone's love of goodness is no less than our own, and the cause of protecting life deserves more help. Moreover, this association aims for great unity and does not involve any religious prejudices or any status claims. Participants are widely recruited from all walks of life to participate together, to widely solicit comrades, to generously join, or to widely persuade, or to establish branches to facilitate implementation and promote benevolence. The association's address is within the World Buddhist Laymen's Association on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. The constitution and application form will be sent upon request."</p>

<p>In Taoyuanfang, located at the intersection of North Henan Road, Qipu Road, and North Jiangxi Road, a dispute arose over rent increases, lasting for several months without any resolution. The landlord, Yongkang Company, suddenly filed a lawsuit in court against several households. The main members of the tenant union in the neighborhood, Kong Rixuan, He Xiaodong, Qian Changcui, Zhao Yaoting, Xu Muxian, Xu Xi, Feng Biao, etc., tried their best to cope, and the situation almost escalated. Fortunately, Mr. Feng Bingnan, a Chinese director of the Public Works Department, came forward to mediate and agreed on a compromise as follows: (1) Rent will be increased from July 1, 1933, according to the following standards: (Original rent) 20 yuan, (compromise) add 3.5 yuan; 33 yuan add 4.5 yuan; 43 yuan add 5.5 yuan; 30 yuan add 4 yuan; 37 yuan add 5 yuan; 68 yuan add 8.5 yuan. (2) Iron gates will be installed at all alley entrances within 1933, and gatekeepers will be added. (3) The landlord will be responsible for repairing damaged houses immediately. (4) Sanitation and cleaning within the alleys will be improved. The rattan workers and various vendors, which were vehemently opposed by all tenants in previous general meetings and were extremely unbearable, must be completely cleared by the landlord within one week. Both parties have fully accepted and exchanged written evidence. The rent increase turmoil has come to a peaceful end.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Over a Hundred Thatched Sheds Reduced to Ashes at the North Gate Outside Great Western Road Bridge: A Scene Reminiscent of the Devastating Fire Last Winter; A Child's Private Baking of Cakes Turns into a Major Disaster; Hundreds Left Homeless in a Pitiful State <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The area around Great Western Road Bridge, in the Tanziwan area north of the Gate, has long been occupied by a group of poor people from Jiangbei, whose thatched sheds stand in rows, forming a market town. Those traveling to and from Beijing and Hangzhou can see them from the train windows when passing by the Great Western Road Bridge station. Last winter, a fire broke out in the thatched sheds south of the Great Western Road Bridge, burning everything to the ground. The tragic scene at that time saddened those who witnessed it. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM yesterday, just as the various fire brigades were extinguishing a fire at the Yuan Da Oil Press on Hengfeng Road, the thatched sheds north of the Great Western Road Bridge suddenly burst into flames, creating a scene no less tragic than that of the previous year. The cause of the fire was that a man from Jiangbei named Yu Jinbao had built a thatched shed north of the Great Western Road Bridge as his residence and set up a cake stall in front of it. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, Yu Jinbao had to go out, leaving only his son, who was just over ten years old, at home. The child, being playful, saw that his father was not there and secretly made cakes from flour and roasted them over the fire, hoping to satisfy his hunger. Before long, he completely forgot about it and went outside to play with the neighboring children. However, the fire in the cake oven was burning fiercely, and there was no fire cover on top, so it heated the straw and, combined with the dry weather of late and the intense heat, it ignited instantly. White smoke billowed, and flames blazed. When neighbors discovered it, it was already too late. People scattered in all directions, and the surrounding houses caught fire simultaneously. Moreover, straw is a highly flammable material, so in a moment, everything was engulfed in flames. The sound of weeping and wailing shook the heavens. People, old and young, fled for their lives, unable to escape in time. Upon hearing the alarm, the fourth district and third police stations of the Tanziwan area immediately dispatched police to maintain order. At the same time, they urgently telegraphed the various fire brigades in Zhabei to rush to the scene to put out the fire. However, the situation was already beyond control. The flames rose high, and the red light filled the sky, leaving the firefighters with no place to start. They tried their best to protect the other houses that had not been affected, while pulling down the burning thatched sheds and pouring water around them. But the fire kept flaring up here and there until around 5:00 PM, when it was finally completely extinguished. However, more than 110 thatched sheds and 21 tile-roofed houses along the north bank had already been reduced to ashes. A group of poor people, looking emaciated, sat on the ground south of the bridge, gazing at the disaster area, tears streaming down their faces. In addition, the weather was cold, and they had lost their shelter, so they were all shivering and pitiful. The young and old were begging for food, awaiting charity from philanthropists. Yu Jinbao and his son, who had caused the disaster, were apprehended by the police from the fourth district and third police station after the incident and escorted to the fourth district headquarters for questioning. That evening, the district arranged for rice and porridge to be cooked and distributed to the victims. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. At the same time, the China Water &amp; Electric Co. plant near the fire scene was also spared, which can be considered very fortunate, otherwise, the consequences would have been even more unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e162">$5,000 Robbery Case: Shen Qixiang Robbed While Delivering Money; All Banknotes Had Secret Marks <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Yuru, the owner of the Juxing Qianzhuang (money exchange) at Yuqi Bridge in the Public Concession, established a Nanshi office inside Yuan Da Pig Shop in Yong'an Lane, Sixteenth Ward, last spring to facilitate deposits and withdrawals for Nanshi customers. Yesterday at around 11:00 AM, Zhang Qianqian, the director of the office, suddenly received calls from Yuan Yu Rice Shop on Wanyu Wharf inside Limalu and Yongli Flower Shop on Laiyi Wharf inside Limalu, requesting funds. He then handed 5,000 yuan in banknotes to an apprentice, Shen Qixiang, to deliver to the respective establishments. Among this money, 3,000 yuan consisted of five-yuan banknotes from the Bank of China, each marked with the character "濤" (Tao) in all four corners. The remaining 2,000 yuan consisted of five-yuan banknotes from the China Industrial Bank, each marked with the character "天" (Tian) in all four corners. The apprentice wrapped the banknotes in old newspaper and carried them under his left shoulder. He walked out of the office, hired a rickshaw, and intended to deliver 3,000 yuan to Yuan Yu Rice Shop first and 2,000 yuan to Yongli Flower Shop. Unexpectedly, as he was passing the entrance to Jiuhe Lane on Guanqiao Inside Limalu, two robbers suddenly appeared. One was wearing a blue cloth short-sleeved shirt and pants, and the other was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and pants. They ran up from behind Shen's rickshaw, stopped the vehicle, and each pulled out a pistol, ordering Shen not to make a sound. The robber wearing black clothes reached out and forcibly snatched the bundle of 5,000 yuan from Shen, carrying the loot and fleeing north. The robber wearing blue clothes, seeing that the money had been obtained, ordered the rickshaw puller to move forward. After a few steps, he turned around and fled south. At this time, Shen, regaining his composure, jumped off the rickshaw and shouted for help to catch the robbers. Qin Fan, the guard at the Twelfth Post, heard the commotion and rushed to pursue, but because the area was crowded with people, the two robbers disappeared into the crowd in an instant, failing to be apprehended. The incident was immediately reported to the First District Headquarters. Currently, District Chief Guan Gong is ordering a strict investigation.</p>

<p>Yongli Dyeing Factory, located at No. 2, Lane 97, Puyu East Road, outside the Great South Gate of Nanshi, had a thriving business, attracting the attention of bandits. In June of this year, a group of thugs broke into the factory and shot and killed Tong Baoshun, the factory owner, before fleeing without a trace. Tong's wife, Xie, reported the incident to the police, who opened a case for investigation. However, since Tong's death, Xie has been managing the factory. Unexpectedly, on the second of this month, she received a threatening letter. The letter stated that due to a large number of brothers and the difficulty of making a living, the author was requesting a loan of 5,000 yuan. She was asked to prepare the money, wrap it in red paper, and send someone to wait inside the China Garden outside the Great Western Road Bridge in the Public Concession from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the tenth, where someone would come to make contact. If she did not comply with the letter, there would be consequences. The letter was signed "Wang Tongren." At the time, Xie believed it was just a letter of extortion, so she ignored it. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the seventh, she received another threatening letter of the same kind. She immediately reported the incident to the Third Precinct of the First District, who then forwarded it to the First District Headquarters. District Chief Guan Gong dispatched detectives to coordinate with the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Public Concession Police.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Proposal to Reduce Rent <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xingyi, a standing committee member of the China National Products Preservation Association, proposed that since the bankruptcy of rural areas, people have little wealth, their homes are bare, and general purchasing power has weakened, which has affected all industries and businesses, leading to their decline. The various industries in Shanghai have also suffered as a result. This is evidenced by the "Great Sale" and "Great Sacrifice" banners flying on various roads year-round. However, rents in Shanghai have always been high, and at a time of commercial decline, not only have they not decreased, but they have continued to increase, causing business operators to sigh that their income is insufficient to cover the rent. As a result, those with some assets are afraid of doing business and dare not venture into it, leading to newly built commercial buildings remaining empty and unoccupied for long periods of time. In view of this, Wang Xingyi, a standing committee member of the China National Products Preservation Association, proposed that the association initiate a request to the Municipal Social Bureau to convene various important organizations to form a Rent Evaluation Committee to find ways to reduce rents, thereby alleviating social panic and maintaining industrial and commercial livelihoods. This matter concerns the prosperity and decline of Shanghai and is of great importance. It is hoped that all sages will work together to assist and urge its implementation, so that it can be realized. This would not only be fortunate for Shanghai but also for the entire country. The full text of his proposal is excerpted below: (Proposal) In order to alleviate the decline of all industries and businesses in Shanghai and the social panic, it is proposed to suggest that the municipal government implement rent reductions to rescue businesses in distress and avert crises. (Reasons) I have observed that the commercial decline and social panic in Shanghai in recent years have been on the verge of collapse, especially this year with the bankruptcy of rural areas and the commercial recession, which has clearly presented an unprecedented phenomenon of depression. Our national product manufacturers are particularly distressed by this adversity. Since the beginning of this year, prices have continued to fall, sales channels have become narrower, resulting in the stagnation of goods and the accumulation of goods like mountains, and huge expenditures that cannot be stopped. It is unpredictable that the current situation will become more and more unfavorable, and the crisis will become more and more obvious. If we do not urgently seek to save it, the demise of Shanghai can be counted on the days, and its impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood is unbearable. I am heartbroken by what I have witnessed, so I do not hesitate to offer my humble suggestions for relief, hoping that you will consider them carefully. Since the "January 28th Incident" in Shanghai, our national vitality has already been greatly damaged. The loss of the four northeastern provinces, the communist bandits in Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces, the frequent disasters everywhere, and the heavy taxes have led to the daily decline of national products and the increasing dumping of foreign goods, resulting in an uncountable outflow of money. Although enthusiastic people have worked hard to promote and advocate national products, their words have been of no use, and the actual results are zero. Because when looking around, Chinese people all have bad habits of abandoning the old and liking the new, worshipping Europeanization, pursuing external appearances, and disregarding the national foundation, resulting in fruitless efforts and no way to remedy the situation. This is the reason why our national product industry has suffered. In addition, the high rents in Shanghai in recent years have reached their extreme. At a time when people's purchasing power is weak and social finance is in panic, various businesses are in dire straits and have almost no business to speak of, eventually leading to empty doors and few customers. Although they use various methods to attract customers, it is nothing more than competing with their peers. This situation is not unique to all industries in Shanghai, but also to businesses in the interior, and Shanghai businesses are the most distressed. Because rents in Shanghai continue to rise, endlessly, and the burden on various businesses is too heavy, and the income from operations is used to pay the rent, and they are still worried that it is not enough, eventually leading to the inability to operate, and the situation is bound to collapse completely. However, the landlords, in this situation, can they be spared? Looking back at the newly built commercial buildings on various roads, which were quickly rented out in the past and the demand exceeded the supply, are now empty for more than a year and no one cares about them. The crux of the matter is self-evident. It is like this for businesses, and it is like that for landlords, both suffering losses and perishing together. If we do not change our course, will the harm not be severe? I have bones in my throat and dare not remain silent, so I have listed the reasons and put forward the proposal. Whether it is appropriate or not, I am waiting for the public to decide. (Methods) If agreed, please have the Municipal Social Bureau of the Municipal Government order the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene the Taxpaying Chinese Association of the Concessions, the General Federation of Citizens of the Special District, and other relevant organizations to form a Rent Evaluation Committee to jointly discuss and decide on methods to persuade Chinese and Western landlords in Shanghai to quickly and voluntarily reduce rents, thereby alleviating business difficulties, maintaining business, and taking care of the livelihood of citizens, and also avoiding the huge losses of newly built commercial buildings remaining empty for a long time. It is truly a case of achieving several benefits with one move.</p>
<p>The detectives, following the instructions, went to the China Garden at the specified address around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday for a secret ambush. One detective disguised himself as a worker, holding a red paper package and standing guard. Around 4:00 PM, two men were seen approaching to make contact. The detectives rushed forward and arrested both men. They were taken to the police station. During the preliminary hearing yesterday morning, one of the men, identified as Tong Lianzhong, 27 years old, from Shaoxing, currently residing on the upper floor of the Hua Fang Laundry at No. 72, Tianzhu Church Street, French Concession, confessed that Tong Baoshun, the deceased owner of Yongli Dyeing Factory, was his uncle, and Xie was his aunt. Because he had been unemployed for a long time and was struggling to make a living, he resorted to extorting his aunt. The two threatening letters were written by his roommate, Liao Hanmin. Today, he, along with Liao and Jin Bingkang, who was arrested at the same time, went to China Garden to collect the money, but were apprehended. Liao had already taken the opportunity to escape. The other man, identified as Jin Bingkang, 19 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 10, Fumin Street, Xinbeimen, also confessed without hesitation to conspiring with Tong to send letters to Tong Xie for extortion. As the matter concerned extortion, an official document was prepared to transfer the two suspects to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

The two stores have business dealings with various stores in Shandong Qingzhou Zhoucun Zhoufang and other places. Suddenly, at the beginning of August this year, they received telegrams from Shanghai stating that Hengsheng Public and Yifengchang owed excessive amounts of money to the bank and had decided to seize their goods, causing stores in other places to mistakenly believe it was true and not send goods to Shanghai for consignment sales. After investigation by Cai Renbao and Zhang Zhuping, the managers of the two stores, it was discovered that the person who sent the telegrams was Xing Zhonghe, the manager of Yonghecheng. Because Xing had previously been the manager of Yuhecheng Silk Store, Yuhecheng owed money to Hengsheng Public and Yifengchang. Cai and others repeatedly demanded payment, leading to a feud. As a means of revenge, Xing took this action. After the matter was clarified, Cai filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court accusing Xing of spreading rumors and forging documents. The case has been heard several times. Because the court wanted to summon the telegraph bureau's receiving clerk to ask who sent the telegrams and investigate various evidence and witnesses, the hearing was postponed to yesterday afternoon. The receiving clerk on duty at the telegraph bureau on July 31 at 11:00 PM was summoned to court and stated that on that day at 11:00 PM, more than a dozen telegrams were sent to Qingzhou, delivered by a person resembling a tea house waiter. The sender's address was stated to be Wang Shuchang, Baxianfang, Baxian Bridge, French Concession. However, after these telegrams were sent, several were returned because the recipient's address was unknown. When the telegrams were returned to the original sender in Baxianfang, no such person could be found. On August 2, another tea house waiter delivered a telegram to Qingzhou. Because the bureau wanted to inquire about the sender without an address, it tentatively asked this person, who replied that the person who sent the telegrams on July 31 was from Yonghecheng Store on Tianjin Road, and the telephone number was 10075. Therefore, he immediately noted it down for inquiries and returning telegrams. Judge Liu asked, "There are many people who send telegrams every day, how could you ask only this one person?" The clerk replied, "There are many people who send telegrams, but very few who send to Qingzhou. At that time, it was also just a tentative inquiry, because ideally, people from Qingzhou must know the situation of their fellow villagers." At this point, Judge Liu also summoned Xing Shiying, Li Cengxing, and others, witnesses presented by Xing Zhonghe's side, to ask whether they had sent telegrams and who had written them. He also ordered them to write numbers in court for handwriting examination. The lawyers for the plaintiffs, Cai Liucheng and Sun Yuan, stated that the signature on the telegram draft submitted by the telegraph bureau clerk for the telegrams sent on July 31 contained numbers, and it was discovered that there were similarities with the handwriting on another document. They requested the court to pay attention and submitted the document with the same handwriting for review. The court then adjourned the hearing to continue on the 18th of this month.</p>

<p>Zhang Dexiang, a 58-year-old from Zhenjiang, had been running Yetai Shoe Repair Shop at No. 452 North Henan Road for many years. Zhang was peaceful, amiable, and kind, so the neighbors around him praised him. If friends and relatives had urgent needs, he never refused. He had previously acted as a guarantor for someone, borrowing 500 yuan from his friend Yao. Later, the creditor suddenly disappeared. It was said that he had committed suicide by drowning himself due to economic difficulties. In August of this year, Yao filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, and the court ruled that Zhang should settle the case with 300 yuan. He was to pay 150 yuan first. Unexpectedly, the night before, when Zhang suddenly went out and had not returned, Yao suddenly arrived and claimed to his wife, Wang, that half of the remaining amount was still owed and had to be returned immediately, otherwise he would seal up the store. After Zhang returned, she truthfully told him what had happened. Zhang, hearing this, felt resentful because the business in the store was not very good and he could not raise the money for a while, so he became weary of the world. He secretly swallowed opium smoke and committed suicide. Later, his wife discovered it and sent him to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The hospital reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered Detective Zhao Lianbi to investigate. After investigation, the body was taken to the Feilun Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Junqing of the First Special Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to the report of the deceased's wife, Zhang Wang, Zhang examined the body and determined that the deceased, Zhang Dexiang, a male, had indeed died of opium poisoning during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his wife, Zhang Wang, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>

<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, a middle-aged man suddenly entered the Women's Commercial Bank at No. 392 Nanjing Road. After lingering for a while, he left. Not long after, the man suddenly returned, holding an empty flour bag in one hand and a pistol in the other. He pointed the gun at the chest of Zhao Yuhua, the bank's guard No. 1471, and threatened him. Zhao knew he was a robber, but because the robber had entered alone and had no accomplices, he thought of resisting. He forcibly grabbed the gun pointed at his chest, intending to seize it. Seeing that the gun had been seized, the robber abandoned it and fled out the door. Zhao also chased after him madly. At the intersection of Tianjin Road, Zhao reported the incident to Chinese Detective Lang Zuyin and detective Bao Wang Rulin, who arrived and arrested the man, taking him to the Old Gate Police Station. He confessed that his name was Xu Zhongyuan, a native of Tianjin, who had been doing business in his hometown. Later, he fled to Shanghai after stealing items. Now that he had used up all the money, he thought of a desperate measure. The pistol was not real but a toy purchased from the Sincere Company. The detectives took him into custody. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Ru Baoyi, the police station's lawyer, presented the case and stated that further investigation was needed, requesting an extension of the hearing. The defendant confessed without denying the charges. Presiding Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further hearing.</p>

<p>Yuanda Oil Press, located at No. 79 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, with an oil storage facility adjacent to the oil press, was well-equipped. It was established by Li from Haiyan, Zhejiang Province, and others as a joint venture. It had been operating for eleven years, with fairly good business. However, yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, the motor inside the oil press suddenly short-circuited. Efforts to save it were unsuccessful, and thick smoke quickly filled the area, turning into a raging inferno. The machine room was the first to be destroyed, and the fire spread to the oil storage facility, which contained over two hundred dan of soybean oil. Adding fuel to the fire, the flames burned even more fiercely, reaching the sky and becoming uncontrollable. Nearby residents, young and old, helped each other to move boxes and trunks, fleeing in a hurried panic, causing immediate chaos. Fortunately, the Second Branch of the Fourth District and the Zhabei fire brigades received the alert and arrived promptly. They made every effort to control the situation while bravely fighting the fire. However, the soybean oil had already been heated by the intense flames and was completely ablaze, making water ineffective. Firefighters then tried to contain the fire to prevent it from spreading, while also meticulously battling the blaze. It was not until around 11:00 AM that the fire was extinguished. The oil storage facility was completely destroyed. Fearing reignition, one fire engine was left at the scene to spray water. It returned at around 1:00 PM. After the incident, the total loss to the factory was estimated to be over ten thousand yuan. He Hanhua, the factory accountant (age 27, from Wuxi), was taken to the Second Branch of the Fourth District for questioning after the incident. As the factory owner could not be found, He Hanhua was temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>

Yunxiang has a cousin named Yu Baolin, who is 19 years old and unmarried. He lives in their hometown of Xinghua. Tang and Yu have had a close relationship since childhood, and their affection deepened as they grew older. They pledged to be together for life. However, Yunxiang kept their relationship a secret from her mother, believing that the time was not yet right. After Yunxiang came to Shanghai with her mother, although they could not see each other every day, they exchanged letters frequently. This shows the depth of their love for each other. However, her mother noticed that Yunxiang was receiving more letters than usual, and became suspicious. She wanted to find out who was writing to her. Yesterday, Yu Baolin sent another letter to Yunxiang, but her mother intercepted it when she was out. She immediately took it to a scholar to decipher the meaning. After reading it, her mother became furious, believing that young women should not engage in love affairs with men. She scolded Yunxiang severely. Feeling hopeless, Yunxiang secretly left the house and walked to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf, where she attempted to drown herself. Fortunately, a patrol boat from the Water Police Department saw her and rescued her. After learning the details, she was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and is expected to recover fully.</p>

<p>▲ China Book Company Gives Away Collection of Essays on Basic English: Since Basic English was introduced to China, the China Book Company has published several books on Basic English, such as the Basic English List, Basic English Introduction, Basic English Grammar, and Basic English Textbook, which have all been popular with readers. The textbook is even being taught through radio broadcasts, attracting even more learners. For a time, it became popular nationwide, and many considered it to be a shortcut to learning English. However, this also aroused the opposition of some people, such as Mr. Lin Yutang, from the perspective of an English scholar, and supporters of Esperanto, from the perspective of an international language. They have all raised objections, leading to a debate in newspapers and magazines in Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and other places. Now, the Basic English Research Society has compiled a book entitled "Collection of Essays on Basic English," published by the China Book Company, priced at one jiao and a half. It summarizes the structure of Basic English, critiques various viewpoints, and discusses each point from a theoretical perspective. Anyone who is concerned about the Basic English debate or wants to understand the characteristics of Basic English must read this book. The company is offering a number of copies for free as a way of thanking those who love reading Basic English books. Please attach a one-fen postage stamp and send a letter to the Promotion Department, General Factory, China Book Company, Jing'an Temple Road, and a copy will be mailed to you. The offer is valid while supplies last.</p>

<p>▲ Jinling Beats Central 3-2</p>
<p>▲ Fudan Beats Guanghua 5-0</p>
<p>▲ Jinan Beats Daxia 3-0</p>
<p>▲ Chizhi Forfeits Due to Lack of Team</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Athletic Association's football league opened yesterday. There were four games between teams from Nanjing and Shanghai. Chizhi forfeited due to the lack of a team, so Jiaotong University did not play yesterday. Guanghua's football team is declining, losing 5-0 to Fudan. Daxia is improving, resisting Jinan strongly and only losing by three goals. Jinling beat Central 3-2. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Fudan Beats Guanghua: The Fudan University football team is an excellent team among the university teams. Its performance over the years has been remarkable. Last winter, it won the championship of the Central Group of the Chinese Football Association. Guan Xun'an is a famous player from Donghua, and Feng Nianhan and Yu Shunzhang are rising stars. The entire team is well-rounded in both offense and defense. Guanghua's football team has been declining year by year. Yesterday's game against Fudan at Jinan Stadium was one-sided. Guanghua was overwhelmed and exhausted. In the first half, Yu Shunzhang and Zhou Shaowen each scored a goal for Fudan. In the second half, Fudan continued its offensive, repeatedly disturbing Guanghua's defense. Yu Shunzhang scored two more goals, and Wang Wenjing also contributed a goal. Although Guanghua resisted stubbornly, they were ultimately unable to match Fudan, which won 5-0. The referee was Shen Huichun.</p>

<p>Tao Yingjie, Deng Ruiai, Li Zumian, Li Zheng, Xia Jianguo, Hu Chunhan, Gu Zhengjia, Fu Dunkui, Zhang Zhengjiang, Deng Youzeng, Wu Dasheng</p>
<p>▲ Jinan Beats Daxia: Jinan is the leader of university football. It considers the Jiangnan University championship to be a prized possession. Its performance in the Western League football competition has always been remarkable. Playing against Daxia was like retrieving something from a bag, as easy as turning one's hand. However, Daxia has no famous reputation. Losing only three goals to Jinan yesterday can be considered a victory in defeat. From this, Daxia's football team shows signs of emerging. After the start of the game, the two teams were polite to each other for a long time. Then, Jinan's Gu Shanghe advanced into the midfield and sent the ball towards Daxia's goal. Daxia's goalkeeper Qiu Ruchuan made a mistake, and Xu Yahui succeeded, scoring a goal. Shortly after, Yahui scored another goal. At that time, Jinan's offense was very strong, and Daxia's goalkeeper was very busy. After a while, Qiu Zhenan also scored a goal. In the first half, Jinan won 3-0. In the second half, Jinan adopted a more conservative approach and the game ended peacefully. The referee was Lu Xiangqian.</p>

<p>▲ Jinling Beats Central: (Nanjing, November 11) In the first game of the Jiangnan University football league, Jinling played against Central at the Central University stadium at 2:30 PM on the 11th. The referee was Lu Songen. In the first half, Jinling's Zhong Guanming and Liu Zuxiu each scored a goal. Central only scored one goal from a penalty kick by Xu Yusu. Jinling led 2-1. Ten minutes into the second half, Central's Zhang Pu scored a goal, tying the game. Then, Jinling's Lin Jianxue scored a goal. The final result was 3-2, Jinling won.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Yu You Team Defeats Lux, Dong Wah Wins Against Wasces - Yu You Initially Behind by Four Goals, Then Scores Five to Four to Win - Wasces Plays with Ten Men, Dong Wah Wins Two to One - Today, Jinan Plays Against the British Navy at the Baseball Field <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the baseball field, in the match between Yu You and Lux, Yu You was at a disadvantage in the first half due to facing the wind. Lux showed its might, and within half an hour, Yu You conceded four goals in a row, causing great alarm, and everyone thought they would surely lose. Unexpectedly, Yu You exerted themselves, managed to pull one goal back, and in the second half, riding the wind, their momentum soared. They scored four more goals, turning sorrow into joy with a score of five to four, snatching victory from defeat. As for the match between Yat Garden's Dong Wah and the Wasces Army, it was initially thought that with Dong Wah's Li Yichen going to Hong Kong and Guan Xun'an unable to play, Wasces' powerful force would easily defeat Dong Wah. However, the opposite happened. After Wasces scored a goal within the first minute, their right forward suddenly left the field due to a foot injury. From then on, they played with only ten men, and gaps frequently appeared in their defense, allowing Dong Wah's Cao Qiuting to score two goals in a row, leading to their final victory. It can be said that they had good fortune. Today, Jinan will play against the British Navy at the baseball field. The Navy will be represented by the very fierce Kantuo. Jinan must be careful. The China Association has a total of eight matches, and the details are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Good Fortune Shines, Dong Wah Indeed Defeats the British Army - ▲ One Goal Lost Within the First Minute ▲ Enemy General Injured, Two Goals Scored in Succession <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Wasces first drew one-to-one with Jinan, then defeated Yu You eight-to-four, and their reputation spread far and wide. Yesterday's battle with Dong Wah at Yat Garden was even more of a concern for fans. Prior to the match, public opinion considered this the only difficult hurdle for Dong Wah. Unexpectedly, good fortune shone on Dong Wah, because one quarter of an hour after the start, the army's right forward, Smith, was injured and left the field. From then on, they fought with ten men. Although they scored a goal within the first minute, Dong Wah's Cao Qiuting ultimately scored two goals in a row, resulting in a two-to-one victory. The loss of a key general greatly affected the army's strength. However, the thoroughness of Dong Wah's internal defense and the solid cooperation of the inside forwards cannot be denied. The ferocity of the Qiba center forward, Mulen, was closely monitored by Li Ning and Wang Changying, leaving him with no opportunity to move. In terms of performance, the first half was tense, and in the second half, Dong Wah attacked more than they defended. Although Wasces made a desperate effort, they achieved nothing.</p>
<p>▲ Dong Wah Team</p>

<p>Dong Wah kicked off, and Tu Kaiyuan launched an attack through the center, passing the ball to the left. Wan Xianghua passed it back in front of the enemy's goal. Cao Qiuting rushed forward but was intercepted by the enemy. Feng Yunyou passed it back in, but Smith kicked it out a step ahead. The center forward received the ball, passed Wang Changying, and passed it to Paigen, reaching the baseline unimpeded. The Dong Wah goal was suddenly in danger. Paigen passed it in front of the goal, but Li Ning could not defend in time. Mulen rushed forward and kicked. The ball flew forcefully, touched Zhou Xianyan's foot, and entered the goal. In three passes, they achieved great success. Not only was Dong Wah shocked, but the audience was also amazed. Only one minute had passed. Wasces' momentum greatly increased, and the left and right wings were eager to try, constantly harassing the border. Once, Li Ning blocked the attack, and once Zhou Xianyan made a diving save, turning danger into safety.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Goalkeeper Panics, Qiuting Achieves Success <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Dong Wah was caught off guard and suddenly lost a goal. They had to proceed cautiously and carefully. The forward and inside forwards worked together to closely monitor the forwards who came to attack and disrupt the enemy's camp. There were wonderful passes on both wings. The enemy's defense was also strict, but the goalkeeper panicked and was restless, with the possibility of losing the goal at any time. At the same time, Wasces' right forward, P. Smith, injured his foot while fighting for the ball with Wan Xianghua and fell to the ground. From then on, they fought with only ten men. Their defensive strength greatly diminished, and their rear was increasingly unsupported, sometimes unable to attend to everything. Tu Kaiyuan's long shot once made the enemy very nervous. Wan Xianghua broke through on the east side, and the ball fell in front of the goal. Cao Qiuting headed the ball, not skillfully, but the goalkeeper was panicked and dropped the ball. The ball fell into the goal line. Dong Wah then scored a goal, tying the score at one-to-one.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Stirring Up Trouble, Another City Captured <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>From then on, Dong Wah's momentum greatly increased, and with the opposing defender missing one player, Wan Xianghua was able to move freely. Wasces' goal was like a target in front, becoming the target of everyone, and suffering the storm and being frightened. Later, Wan Xianghua sent out a corner kick. The goalkeeper rushed out to save it, but did not hit it far. However, the person fell to the ground. In the melee, Cao Qiuting shot a cold arrow from the crowd, and Dong Wah scored another goal. Afterwards, Wan sent another high ball. Cao Qiuting headed the ball six or seven yards in front of the goal, and the ball bounced off the goalkeeper's foot. He attacked again and happened to hit the goalkeeper's face. In a strange way, the ball was blocked back. It was extremely fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Loyal to the Country, All is Well <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>In the rematch, Wasces were eager for revenge, and the entire army went to the front line, fiercely attacking Dong Wah. Seeing that the situation was not good, Dong Wah defended more than attacked, resisting with all their strength. Li Ning was majestic and had merit in protecting the team. Wang Changying was loyal to the country, sparing no effort. Wu Youliang, Tu Kaiyuan, and Feng Yunyou were in harmony, and there were no flaws. Zhou Xianyan was a stalwart at the pass, invincible. Although the Qiba offensive was fierce, there was no gap to take advantage of. Although Mulai was ferocious, he was monitored and unable to do anything, wasting effort and failing at the last step. And focusing on attack, neglecting defense, he was attacked by Jia Youliang alone, directly attacking Huanglong. The city gate suddenly fell again, but it was canceled due to offside. After that, Feng Yunyou fought with injuries, and the rear was alarmed. Chen Hongguang was immediately transferred back to camp to protect the team. All was well. Two-to-one was the final result.</p>
<h3 id="e199">A Narrow Escape, Yu You Turns the Tables on Lux - Bad Luck Leads to Conceding Four Goals First - Reliance on Hard Work to Reverse the Defeat <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The weather was pleasant and sunny. Although Yat Garden had a match, diverting many fans, there were still three thousand spectators at the baseball field. Yu You had a bad start to this season. In the first match, they were poisoned by the French team. In yesterday's battle with Lux, Jiang Shanjing's foot injury had not healed, and Aqiao was nowhere to be found. Although he followed the team, he did not play. Wang Shusen was promoted to a higher level, leaving the defense extremely empty. In the first half, they conceded four goals in a row, and the audience was uneasy, all regretting for the team. Unexpectedly, if one has ambition, things will be successful. In the second half, relying on the efforts of the generals to counterattack, they actually won five to four, turning defeat into victory. It cannot be said that this was not a narrow escape.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Shocking the World, the Heavy Defense Falls Completely <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Lux is a team that is soft and hard. Sometimes they are as fierce as tigers, and sometimes as weak as sheep. Their cunning movements and the strangeness of their feet make people fearful. Not long after the kick-off, Hade got the ball and ran excitedly, rushing into the penalty area and hitting a goal. Yu You counterattacked twice but failed to score. Rodman tangled with Huang Ruihua at the kick-off line. Jones took the opportunity to turn behind Zhu Qiu and approach the Yu You goal. Wang Caigao was unable to save the situation. Bao Shalie arrived in an instant, puffed out his chest, and the ball had already entered the goal. Five minutes later, Bao Shalie scored another goal. The Lux offensive did not weaken slightly. Before long, Zhu Qiu again fouled in the penalty area with the courage of a strong man. Rodman took the penalty and made it four to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Iron Leg is Furious, Recapturing a City <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>At this time, the advantages and disadvantages of both sides were like a high peak and a vast sea, impossible to look up to, and the audience was also discouraged, all expecting Yu You to have no hope of recovery. Unexpectedly, the situation changed suddenly, like white clothes and gray dogs. Chen Jiaqiu was filled with righteous indignation, and with a turn of his eye, Liang Shutang was flattered and immediately gave his best performance. Jiaqiu got the ball and broke into the opponent's center defense line. Desa and the two generals greeted him side by side. Jiaqiu cleverly dodged, turned, and passed the ball to Lao Sun. With a loud bang, Robertz was caught off guard and lost a goal. The first half ended here.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Speed of Lightning <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, Yu You was determined to avenge their defeat. After the kick-off, Wang Shusen and Liang Shutang continued to deliver military supplies. The Lux forbidden area suddenly became restless. Kirklen made a mistake and regretted it for a lifetime. Chen Jiaqiu secretly crossed Yinping, reaching a considerable position, and passed the ball to Sun Jinrong. The two He brothers, big and small, glared angrily, bared their teeth, and came to stop him together. Sun cleverly used his divine skills, slightly adjusted his body, and left the two behind him. He drew his bow and arrow and hit the bullseye. Only two minutes had passed since the kick-off. After a long melee, Sun Jinshun made a comeback and reached the opponent's penalty area. He was embarrassed by the small He brother, so he secretly passed the ball to Li Shuoyou, who broke through the goal for the third time. The score was only one goal apart.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Yongsen and Shuoyou Achieve Success One After Another <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>At this time, Yu You's flag was extremely bright, rushing east and west, doing what they wanted. Chen Jiaqiu could not move forward, so he passed the ball to Lao Sun and advanced. The Lux rear defense was ambushed, and Sun immediately sent it to Li Shuoyou, who moved towards the goal, a foot away, creating a tie. After Li Shuoyou achieved success, he was still fierce and shouted in the east from time to time. Sun Iron Leg fought hard in the center. In the chaos, Yongsen took the opportunity to cover and kill, rushing out from the bottom of the net with the person and the ball, and then winning five to four. After that, the silver whistle blew loudly, and the Lux team returned dejectedly. Looking back at the Yu You generals, they were all elated and smiling.</p>

It is a pity that a major error occurred in a refereeing decision in the first set, which is very regrettable.

The Meye Fish team was the mixed doubles champion team of this year's grass court tennis club. Under Qiu Mei yesterday, there was no way out. The two women on both sides had excellent skills, which made the game very interesting, especially Fish, who was stable and error-free. Metmore's high ball was very good, and Qiu blocked the tennis ball, attacking east and west, putting the opponent in a desperate situation. Meyes' suicide ball in front of the net yesterday was countless. After four to one in the first set, Meye Fish won another game, and Qiu Mei won with six to two. In the second set, Qiu Mei won six games in a row, and the whole game only took forty minutes.</p>

<h3 id="e207">▲ Yu Tianguang Fought Hard Against Lin Baohua - Lin Wins the Championship in Three Straight Sets - It's a Pity That Little Yu Lost - 丨 Six to Four · Eight to Six · Six to One 丨 <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>▲ Little Yu's Skills Greatly Improved - Yu Tianguang eliminated Guo Yujie, Shi Guiyake Lasha, and Zheng Zhaojia along the way in the hard court competition, and obtained the right to compete in the final with Lin Baohua. His recent performance is indeed impressive. His serve is powerful, but it is a pity that he made countless double faults at the critical moment yesterday, which is very regrettable. His forehand and backhand draws penetrate deep into the diagonal, and there are several wonderful angle balls that attack Baohua's backhand, which Lin also admires. The start is also fast, but unfortunately, when using the near ball, he used a little less force, and none of them crossed the net. His defeat to Lin Baohua is entirely a matter of experience. If given time, Little Yu's future is limitless.</p>
<p>▲ First Set Referee Error - The old man Gao Mei served as the referee. Yu Tianguang served, and Lin Baohua won three games in a row. Yu Tianguang tried hard to win back two games. When Lin led with four to two, Yu served in the seventh game. The first one touched the net, and then two consecutive shots went out of bounds. The score should have been forty to zero, but the referee announced that it was thirty each. The linesman Ke Lunnuofu immediately stood up to correct it, but the old man stubbornly refused to accept it and insisted on his own opinion. Ke then withdrew and protested to the committee chairman. As a result, Little Yu failed and became five to two. For a time, the audience was indignant. The chairman then discussed with Lin Yu and the referee.</p>

<p>As a result of the deliberation, the verdict was still upheld. In the next two games, Little Yu won and chased to five to four. Lin won the first set with six to four. If the referee had not made a mistake, it should have been five to five at this time, and the outcome would not have been certain.</p>
<p>The second set could have been won but was lost In the second set, Yu Tianguang's voice and momentum increased, taking a great advantage with four to one. Lin won back two games. In the eighth game, Yu led with forty to zero, but due to serving double faults, it became equal. As a result, Lin won, and five to three became four to four. Lin exceeded with five to four, and Yu suppressed him with strength, winning two games in a row, and chasing out with six to five. In the next game, Yu served, from a position of fifteen to forty behind, chased to equality, and then took the lead. Another point could win this set, but unfortunately Yu could not maintain his winning momentum and was won by Lin. As a result, Yu lost again with eight to six. In the last game, he had no intention of fighting, and Lin won again with six to one.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Special Issue - Eating</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Problem of Eating <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Ziyin</p>
<p>Eating rice fills the stomach, and being full gives you energy. With energy, you can work hard and get things done. This sequence of events has been around since the beginning of time, since Shennong invented the cultivation of grains, right? Thinking about it carefully, it's indeed quite interesting. Now, with European and American influences sweeping across China, some fashionable people have changed their habits and are eating bread. Thus, the problem of eating rice has transformed into the problem of eating bread. If you meet an unemployed friend, you might talk about how to solve the bread problem. Instead of talking about the Europeanized bread problem, it would be more accurate to talk about the purely domestic problem of eating rice.</p>
<p>Shanghai, in the eyes of friends in the interior, is truly the easiest place to find food. However, the opposite is true. Shanghai is arguably the most difficult place to find food. If you don't believe me, I can provide concrete examples. Suppose a company—the word "company" is a general term; renting a living room can also be called a company—or a school—which is explained in the same way as a company—wants to hire one or two people. They place a small advertisement with three or four lines of twenty characters. Our general population, eager to find food, will travel thousands of miles to search for it, without asking whether their qualifications are sufficient or their experience is adequate. They rashly go to take the exam, and as a result, they fail miserably, and most are eliminated. From then on, they have no choice but to wait for the second opportunity to come. Day after day, they buy newspapers, and when they see advertisements like "hiring" or "seeking," they won't make a mistake again. Once, twice, three times, four times, going on like this, and in the end, they remain the same. Some people who come from the interior have relatives and friends in Shanghai, so they can still rely on them; some who come to Shanghai and don't know anyone rent apartments and pay for meals. When the money they brought runs out, they end up jumping into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Can you imagine how tragic that is? Thinking this way, finding food in Shanghai is more difficult than in the interior. However, there is a group of people who can eat all kinds of delicacies without spending money. This group of people is respectfully called "beggars" by the Shanghainese. Beggars also have factions. For example, the beggars on Sanma Road and the beggars on Sima Road don't interfere with each other. They each have their own territory and their own sources. After the standard lunch or dinner time, the beggars go out with broken bowls and paper bags, waiting in their respective alleys or intersections. The cooks of the restaurants transfer the leftovers from the diners, and they seem to have a rule that they only need to step forward and pour it out. In this way, they can eat without working. It is said that there are even some old hands in this business who can't finish the food they get, so they soak it in boiling water and sell it to rickshaw pullers for snacks at twenty coppers a bowl! These beggars can be considered economists.</p>
<p>It is difficult for the very rich to approach and understand how they live, but ideally, there shouldn't be much difference. Since it's not relevant to this article, I won't discuss it. Middle- and upper-class families are often accessible, so I know a little about them. Their lives are relatively comfortable. The so-called housewives have the title of housewife but not the reality. All the trivial household affairs are entrusted to the children's nannies and the cleaning maids. People who eat other people's food are never entirely well-intentioned. They often throw good rice and leftover dishes into the sewers. This kind of waste, although it won't be struck by lightning as superstitious people believe, I think it's still hard on one's conscience.</p>
<p>For friends on the verge of desperation, trying to find a bowl of rice is as difficult as described above, while for another type of people, eating is so easy. This is truly a great inequality among human beings!</p>
<p>People in the interior say that "it's easy to find food in Shanghai," which probably refers to the servants of middle- and upper-class families and those beggars, but it can't be taken as a universally true statement.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Special Foods of Guizhou <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Wenbing</p>
<p>Guizhou is a province in the southwest, covered with mountains. It is considered one of the poorest places in inland China. However, Guizhou has many special products that are not easily found in other provinces. I will briefly describe one or two of them to inform the readers:</p>
<p>▲Giant Salamander In the rivers around Guiyang, Guizhou, in addition to common carp and crucian carp, there is a special product called the "baby" (note 1) fish. This fish is an amphibian, and its shape is completely like a human, with hands and feet, able to stand and sit, with eyes, ears, mouth, and nose on its head, scales on its body, and a fish mouth. It has gills under its jaw for breathing in water. The larger ones are one or two feet long and cry just like a newborn baby, so they are called "baby fish." They are most easily seen in the summer. When the sun sets, they climb ashore in groups, sitting or standing, crying or wailing. From a distance, they look like naked children. However, they are very clever. When they see people coming, they dive into the water, so they are not easy to catch. However, sometimes they are caught by fishermen and sold in the market. Cruel people want to taste exotic flavors and still treat them as ordinary fish, killing and eating them. Their taste is very fresh, but if they are not cooked properly, they will taste fishy and difficult to eat. If they are lucky, they will meet kind people who not only don't have the heart to eat them but also make a gold earring for them, wear it on their ears as a mark, and then release them back into the river. In the future, when fishermen encounter them, they will no longer catch them.</p>
<p>▲Luohu Chili Peppers Chili peppers are available everywhere, but the Luohu (note 2) chili peppers of Guizhou are different from ordinary ones. Because ordinary chili peppers are annual herbaceous plants, while the Luohu chili peppers of Guizhou grow on large trees. Their taste is not only better than ordinary chili peppers, but no matter what kind of dish, as long as you add Luohu chili peppers, they can be preserved for more than ten days even in the hot summer without spoiling. Therefore, ordinary chili peppers cost only a few hundred cash per catty, while Luohu chili peppers cost at least one or two yuan per catty. However, they are produced in Luohu County, Guizhou. They cannot be transplanted to other places, probably because the people of Guizhou are addicted to chili peppers. They cannot be full without chili peppers, so the Creator specially created this plant to bestow upon them!</p>
<p>There are many other special products, but due to limited space, I will talk about them next time if I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Baby - In Guizhou, people call children babies.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Luohu - A place name, a county in Guizhou.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Chinese Food in Paris <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei, From Paris</p>
<p>Naturally, my first meal in Paris was Chinese food at a Chinese restaurant. I had planned this on the ship in advance. I was really getting tired of eating bread every day, so eating Chinese food was a happy event. There are several Chinese restaurants in Paris: Tianjin, Dongfang, Wanhualou, Zhonghualou, Shanghailou, and Beijing Restaurant. There are also three near Paris in the suburb of Bignoux. The restaurants are about the same size except Wanhualou, which is the largest and owned by Cantonese people. The owner of Tianjin Restaurant is a French woman who used to be the wife of Lao Xiao. Almost all students who studied in Europe knew Lao Xiao. He made a lot of money from running the restaurant, but the French woman took it all. She divorced him, and he later went to work as a cook at another restaurant. Almost all the Chinese restaurants use Chinese servants, except for Zhonghualou, which uses a few French people. The Chinese restaurants are mostly frequented by Chinese students, followed by many foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Eating in Changshu <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Changshu's soy sauce chicken has become a delicacy for the people of Suzhou. There are many branches in Guanqian Street in Suzhou, such as Longfengzhai and Ma Yongzhai, which seem to compete with Cai Yanzhai's watermelon seeds. In the eyes of us Changshu people, besides soy sauce chicken and soy sauce meat, there are many other special products, such as the golden claw crabs of Tantang, which are no less than those produced in Yangcheng Lake. The shrimp in the Dahe River have soft and thin shells. After the plum rain season, they are full of eggs, which other places cannot match. The sea white shrimp in the Yangtze River have an even more delicious taste. The honey peaches of Guli Village, the deep-water water chestnuts of Caojing, the cantaloupe of Hengjing, the watermelon of Xuegou, and the fresh hairy chestnuts of Dingshan. The white bayberries of Baoyan are all delicacies among fruits. People from other places probably don't know about them, so they are not well-known. On fine spring days, it is a pleasure to visit the mountains in groups and taste the dried tofu in front of the mountain outside the West Gate and the purple ripe water chestnuts outside the North Gate. This is what people who visit Mount Yu often talk about. The fragrant japonica rice and blood glutinous rice are also special products of Changshu. It is said that in the late Qing Dynasty, they were used as tribute. Unfortunately, the production of blood glutinous rice has been decreasing day by day. There are countless other snacks, probably the same as in other places.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the most famous special products of Changshu are probably the soy sauce chicken and soy sauce meat of Ma Yongzhai. As far as I know, the soy sauce chicken of Yanmu Town in Wujiang is no less than that of Changshu, but unfortunately, no one is promoting it. Otherwise, it could be called comparable to the hoof of Fengjing Town. Compared to other places, eating in Changshu's restaurants is better than in Suzhou and Shanghai. Therefore, people like Yu Saoxin and Kang Nanhai used to often visit Mount Yu.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Liangxiang Chestnuts and Coincidence <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jihong</p>
<p>There's a common saying among Shanghai people: "Liangxiang chestnuts, hard times ahead." Coincidentally, this year, Liangxiang chestnut stalls are everywhere, overflowing. Coincidentally, this year, times are truly harder than in previous years, with an economic downturn. The rich have money but nowhere to spend it, the poor need money but have no way to get it. A simple saying has actually become a prophecy: the more Liangxiang chestnuts there are, the harder people's lives become.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Shanghai people are inventive. Just eating chestnuts isn't enough, they have to be candied and stir-fried. Having a phonograph at the stall isn't lively enough, they have to have four-tube or five-tube radios. Costs increase, profits decrease. Liangxiang chestnuts, hard times ahead—another omen.</p>
<p>Usually, a bag of chestnuts costs four cents of silver, equal to twelve copper coins. But coincidentally, this year the price hasn't increased. What's more, they're even doing a "buy two bags, get one free" promotion. Although the quantity isn't increased, "Liangxiang chestnuts, hard times ahead" adds another clear symbol. Otherwise, if business were good, everyone would be raising prices, let alone offering a "buy two, get one free" deal?</p>
<p>The word "difficult," according to Napoleon, exists only in the dictionary of fools. Of course! Our money is flowing out one coin at a time because we lack the ability to succeed; therefore, we have this saying, "Liangxiang chestnuts, hard times ahead."</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Record of Crabs <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The types of crabs, if studied, are a very interesting thing. However, people who enjoy holding crabs only chew them heartily, unaware that their origin and region are closely related! The typical gourmets by the sea know that when "green crabs" (that is, Charybdis japonica) come onto the market in June and July, they come from Zhenning, Zhejiang, and live in the mudflats, revered as the best. But only one or two Western restaurants treat them as rare commodities, and they aren't tasted at ordinary, common banquets. The large "green crabs" can be a foot in circumference, and their two large pincers are especially swollen and fat. The strength of their claws is often enough to cut off a person's finger. When they are cooked in a pot and placed on a white porcelain plate, the color is especially crimson, like red coral, quite a sight to behold! Thirty years ago, when the Guang Bang in Shanghai held the Ullambana Festival, they were used as the most valuable offering to the gods. If you used them as snacks with wine, only someone as rich and discerning as Yan Xiaofang would dare to indulge. Later, Qing Daoren was also a famous crab eater. In fact, the old man was very frugal and still thought "green crabs" were too expensive, unwilling to spend the money to satisfy his appetite!</p>
<p>The Shanghai market mostly uses "Yangcheng Lake crabs" as a selling point, because this type of crab is the most abundant, and the crab bodies seem to be larger than others, with females weighing more than a pound. But this is merely appearance, the contents and cream are not necessarily exquisite. If you carefully distinguish, you will know that they cannot compare to the crabs you encounter in the fishing nets in the countryside! In the southeast of Jiading, there is a kind called "Wang Zi crab" and "Gong Zi crab," which are the most famous. Unfortunately, the output is relatively small, and they are not easily caught until the late autumn weather. What makes these crabs recognizable is that on the back of their shells, there are clearly two types, "Wang" and "Gong." If you don't believe it, put them in a pot and mix them with other crabs of equal size. When they are cooked, lift the lid and you will see that the "Wang" and "Gong" characters are always on top, while the other crabs are pressed underneath. This is the most obvious example. Therefore, the firmness and fullness of this kind of crab can be seen in the amount of struggling strength at the point of death, and the price is more precious!</p>
<p>Now, almost all crabs have "emerged" (a colloquialism meaning there are many crabs), but these two kinds of crabs have not yet appeared on the market. "Zhangpu crabs" from the west gate countryside are the latest to appear. The crab bodies are smaller, but the legs are longer, and the hairs on the legs are slightly yellow. An old person who is familiar with the origin and history of crabs can tell at a glance. There is a Mr. Gu, named Futing, who is nearly eighty years old this year. He has a lifelong addiction to eating crabs. His family always has crabs raised in tanks. If he thinks of eating them, he can take them at will and satisfy his crab craving without having to go out and look for them at expensive prices. He is truly considered an expert in eating crabs! Someone went to ask him where he got his crabs. He never said. Even in the season when there are no crabs to chew on, if you bring up the word "crab," he will reply, "I have them! I have them!" His way of eating crabs is also different from others. Sometimes, in a tavern, he would first break off the pincers of a crab and chew on them one by one. By the time he was tipsy, there would still be a pile of the crab body (slang) untouched. After drinking, he would take it home. He would only finish his crab-eating work during dinner. This way of eating can be considered the most economical plan. I greatly admire him, and I must write it out today for the benefit of like-minded people!</p>
<h3 id="e230">Eating in Suzhou <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Bingqian</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, around the time when maple leaves were turning red and osmanthus flowers were fragrant, I went to Hangzhou to study, staying by the mountains and facing the water. A classmate from Suzhou brought some local specialties to school and generously shared them. After enjoying the food, I quickly wrote a short article called "Eating in Suzhou," which was published in the Qingguang column of the Shishi Xinbao newspaper. A friend from Guangdong, whose name I have already forgotten, insisted that eating in Guangzhou was better and had a written argument with me. In the end, he arrogantly presented a Guangdong mooncake that cost more than one hundred yuan and asked if I, a poor student, had ever tasted one. I said that was capitalized eating, how could it be compared to the people-oriented eating in Suzhou? The debate finally came to an end. Years have passed, it feels like yesterday. I never dreamed that I would wander to the beautiful and culturally rich Suzhou. I am truly fortunate. In the past, eating was just something I talked about on paper, but now, like working in a chemistry lab, I can actually experiment!</p>
<p>Originally, clothing, food, housing, and transportation are essential elements in our daily lives. If we analyze life in detail, who doesn't strive for clothing and food? To put it more broadly, aren't world panic, economic recession, and bread problems also major reasons?</p>
<p>Even the sages said, "Food and sex are human nature." From the moment a person is born until the moment they die, they cannot separate from the word "food" for even one day, unless they are sick. "Three days without food will lead to hunger, seven days without food will lead to death," is a well-established conclusion. Therefore, when I talk about "eating," I don't think the general moralists will regard me as a glutton, right?</p>
<p>Suzhou is a land of fish and rice, a blessed paradise, so the food here is slightly better than in other places. When you walk into the bustling Xuanmiao Temple, you will smell the strong aroma of five spices and scallions. There is Yiwai Zhai's pork chop, with sweet and sour, pepper and salt flavors, pleasing and delicious, all up to you. There is Wufang Zhai's doufu soup, which, according to hygiene principles, is the most nutritious. However, mentioning doufu soup always makes people have a slightly bitter aftertaste. The first time I went to Xuanmiao Temple with a local colleague, he first suggested going to eat doufu soup. I was very surprised and wondered what was so delicious about doufu soup? After trying it, I felt that it had a different flavor. The soup is mixed with dried shrimp, seaweed skin, sesame oil, chili, vinegar, soy sauce… "Five flavors harmonizing create a hundred flavors fragrance." We ate it smoothly and ordered another bowl. Each bowl costs only sixteen copper coins, which can be said to be cheap and good. Then there are also steamed crab dumplings with steaming air, oily black fish, and evenly thick lotus root powder, which are quite tempting. In the crowd, there are people selling pear paste candy, with the soft, delicate Wu dialect, which is enough to make people stop. As for whether the candy is delicious or not? I have not tasted it. The rest of the scattered stalls and shops are arranged in a complex manner, simply a collection of snacks.</p>
<p>Suzhou's sweets are not me doing free promotion for them, they are already famous far and wide. When the League of Nations investigation team visited our country, didn't they come to Suzhou specifically to purchase sweets? The entrances of the candy stores are lined with many small cabinets and colored glass bottles, like opening an exhibition, with various colors and numerous varieties. They have great magic for people, especially children who regard candy as their second life. What chocolate, Gu Keli… are not something we can touch. Under the circumstances of "wanting the horse to run fast, but not wanting the horse to eat grass," what I like the most is butter pine nut candy. The outside of the candy is wrapped in clean and transparent cellophane. When you eat it, it is fresh, sweet, and palatable, and the pine nuts also have the benefit of "prolonging life." Only Suzhou has it, and I especially introduce it to the readers.</p>
<p>Eating in a teahouse is even more people-oriented. A bag of watermelon seeds for a few copper coins can pass a lot of time. There are also several types, such as licorice, perfume, rose… etc. They are small and crispy, so when you eat them, it is different from ordinary wide-backed watermelon seeds or giant watermelon seeds, and you need a bit of eating art! There are also five-spice beans, green plums, olives… sprinkled with licorice powder… interspersed with some peeling sounds while talking and laughing, which is also a unique teahouse style in Suzhou!</p>
<p>The season is autumn. At the entrances of the fruit stores, there are sugar chestnut frying pans. On the streets and alleys, there are vendors selling cooked water chestnuts and fat Yangcheng Lake crabs, and carts of stir-fried ginkgo can be seen everywhere. Sitting at home, without having to move your feet, you can get delicious food. Only the paradise of Suzhou can be enjoyed.</p>
<p>As for Lugaojian's braised pork and Pan Wansheng's fermented bean curd, they were both tributes from the past and are now delicacies. The other delicious things are really too numerous to count!</p>
<p>Thinking of Guangdong's mooncakes that cost more than one hundred yuan and the aristocratic eating of "spending ten thousand coins on food and still having nothing to eat," what is the difference? From the perspective of a foreigner living here, eating in Suzhou is definitely worthy of the name!</p>

<h3 id="e231">The Secret to Success for Writers <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongfang</p>
<p>I once saw in a notebook that Shi Nai'an first hung portraits of the thirty-six main characters of the Water Margin in his study, looking at them morning and night. Later, he "understood them spiritually," and when he wrote, it was as if he had "divine help," so the thirty-six people became active on paper.</p>
<p>This is one of our Chinese ancestral "secrets" for the success of writers. Today, after several studies of the Water Margin, it has been determined that it was not the individual creation of someone named Shi Nai'an, but the fruit of accumulated folk legends. The so-called personalities of the thirty-six main characters were not derived by Shi Nai'an from studying the portraits, but were successfully molded by many unknown folk artists. Shi Nai'an only did the final compilation, so the "secret to success" passed down in the notebook is self-defeating and becomes one of countless "forced interpretations."</p>
<p>In our ancestral "secrets to success," there is another one. The famous Sima Qian was the creator or successful experimenter of this "secret." This means that the reason Sima Qian's writing was "not clumsy and straightforward" was because he "traveled around famous mountains and rivers." In ancient China, where transportation was inconvenient, "traveling around famous mountains and rivers" was indeed not something most people could do. However, Sima Qian actually "traveled" and his writing turned out to be extraordinary, so this "secret" is trustworthy. "Famous mountains and rivers," these dead things—no, it should be said "beautiful nature"—may be able to give a poet a few more poems, or even make a poet's work more "rich and strange," like Du Fu after entering Shu, but it is truly difficult to understand how the prose writer Sima Qian could also get help from "famous mountains and rivers" in his annals and biographies, which were like fragmented court reports. When some ancient Chinese "critics" talked about the "fluency" or "goodness" of writing, they always said things like "understand it spiritually." The saying of "famous mountains and rivers" should also be a kind of "understanding it spiritually." Anyway, it has been "long determined" that a complete Records of the Grand Historian contains all kinds of writing methods.</p>
<p>Jin Shengtan was much more straightforward. He judged that the Water Margin learned from Sima Qian's writing style. This "discovery" of his is actually the third type of Chinese ancestral writer's "secret to success," namely the so-called "transformation." Mr. Shi Zhicun translated it into "modern language," which is "every writer must borrow from the literature of his ancestors." Needless to say, hanging portraits in the study and looking at them morning and night is too troublesome, and you have to ask someone to paint the portraits first, which is especially troublesome. As for "famous mountains and rivers," although "water and land joint transportation" and the opening of highways have made it seem much more convenient than in Sima Qian's time, it is still quite annoying to travel around. It is better to sit comfortably in the study and "borrow from the previous generation." A lithographic edition of Zhuangzi and a lithographic edition of Wen Xuan cost at most four dollars, saving both money and time. With this comparison, it can be seen that those who firmly advise young people to first seek rich life experience are really incredibly silly.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Cloth Peddler <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiahui</p>
<p>Shaking a small flower drum, the cloth peddler walks from village to village, from house to house.</p>
<p>"...Teng teng teng... buy cloth, buy cloth... Teng teng teng... there are so many goods today... Teng teng teng..."</p>
<p>Putting down the load on his shoulders, he shouted loudly, panting. He was very familiar with these places, and he was very familiar with the girls in this area. Just don't know their names. The houses in the countryside are very strange. If several houses are together, there is always a very, very large public yard. In this yard, no matter what season it is, you can see cow dung, chicken dung all over the ground, and diapers floating in the air.</p>
<p>While shaking the small drum in the yard, he chose a stool to sit down and waited for customers. Needless to say, these customers are all girls. As soon as they hear his voice, they always immediately stick their heads out of the lattice windows upstairs and lean over to greet him:</p>
<p>"Hey, cloth seller, let us see your new patterns!"</p>
<p>Then he heard the sound of rolling stones, as the impatient girls came down from the stairs of each house and surrounded the load. His load has many drawers, and they have to rummage through these drawers every time, looking at all the silk threads, lace, pins, buttons, and all the odds and ends. As for the cloth, that goes without saying. They not only have to look at it carefully, but also examine each piece separately. "These patterns are just coming into fashion!"</p>
<p>"No, that's already out of date. My sister bought it last year."</p>
<p>"It looks good, but it's not durable. It feels as thin as paper."</p>
<p>"Reduce the price, I really want to buy a few feet丨丨"</p>
<p>They flipped the cloth back and forth, noisy, like children at the entrance of a candy store. Those sharp eyes all fell on his face, as if exploring, trying to grasp his business weaknesses and attack him.</p>
<p>They are all young, lively girls, as bright as the sun in the countryside. But strangely, they all have stingy minds and cunning tricks, and they want to take advantage of even a small amount of money.</p>
<p>"How many cents a foot?"</p>
<p>"Who wants something that's so frighteningly expensive!"</p>
<p>"Hey, wouldn't it be much cheaper to buy it in the city?"</p>
<p>Women's mouths are really scary. They don't care if people lose money or not, they just want to reduce the price, as if they would only be satisfied if they reduced it to nothing and gave it to them for free.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll give you a few more cents!"</p>
<p>He looked around, looked at those bright, cunning faces, and helplessly? replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p>"You have to take off a little more!"</p>
<p>"I also have to spend money to buy it, and I also have to spend my energy丨丨丨"</p>
<p>Although he said it so gently, and made concessions to the point where he could no longer give in, those heartless girls were still not satisfied;</p>
<p>"People who do business always say the same thing, all the talk about losing money is false. If you don't take off a little more, we won't buy it." "Losing money is true, I'm being honest, but of course old customers can get a little more length."</p>
<p>After a long argument, the business was finally settled, but it was even more troublesome when measuring the cloth.</p>
<p>"Give me a little more, give me a little more, you said yourself that the length is enough!"</p>
<p>"Giving so" little, it's really deceiving!"</p>
<p>They scrambled to press their hands on the cloth, following his ruler closely, specifying a large extra piece of cloth, asking him to give it away, otherwise they would take his ruler and not let go. Of course, he didn't want to at first, after all, it wasn't a Beijing goods store, where could he give away so much? But in the end, he couldn't outwit these girls and had to be careless. Although this kind of transaction clearly didn't make any money, and his own energy was clearly wasted, what else could he do if he didn't do this?</p>
<p>Watching those satisfied girls disperse in a swarm. He just shook his head sadly and mournfully.</p>
<p>When he entered this yard, it may have been in the morning, or it may have been at noon, but he always went back near dusk. Sometimes bathed in the setting sun, sometimes drenched in heavy rain, and sometimes braving the snow, this poor cloth peddler, shaking his drum, carrying a heavy load of cloth, trudging home with tired steps.</p>
<p>"I'm so tired all day, but I only sold this little money, is it enough to eat and wear?" On the way back, he might put the load in a broken pavilion or an old temple, counting the day's income and sighing.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>In Wei Jinzhi's recently published novel "White Flag Bearer," I saw a few sentences about "birds in the free sky." He said that everyone envies the birds flying in the sky, but birds, in reality, are not as free as they imagine. He critically explained the psychology of the protagonist who is working, saying:</p>
<p>Usually, he dreams about it, and with the heart of a poet, he appreciates the eagles in the sky, looking up and admiring them as they are set off against the vast sky. Flying freely, chirping like new jingle bells, but not knowing that the flying is for foraging and the chirping is for hunger. The whip of real life awakens poets from such dreams, of course, quite a few, but at present, there are still many people who think this way. Therefore, I am quoting these two sentences from "White Flag Bearer" again. Poets, don't dream and write about the soaring of "geese" anymore. You can further investigate the reasons and troubles for their soaring. Like humans, aren't birds also struggling for survival?</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>Shen Congwen, in the preface to "A Mother," which was recently published, wrote a preface explaining his own creative attitude. The first paragraph begins by saying:</p>
<p>Because of the troubles of survival, I feel that writing about male and female relationships is more suitable than writing other articles. When writing this, my attitude is no different from my usual creative attitude. In the conflict caused by the desire of men and women, I only do my best to observe and explain this inevitable change. I do not add any prejudiced opinions in favor of or protecting any of the characters, and it seems that I should not have this is the author's very faithful confession of his creative attitude, an attitude that a former realist writer would inevitably adopt. However, the problem lies here. Is it true that the author has no "preconceived notions" when writing? This is impossible. Take photography, for example. It seems that there is no "preconceived notion" and it is "objective and realistic," but the position of the characters and the angle of the light always express the photographer's philosophy. There are "preconceived notions." Of course, the same is true for novels.</p>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>Let's talk about Li Jinming's creative attitude again. In his recently published collection of novels, "Lost Scenery," he also wrote a self-confession of his creative attitude, a preface. He criticized his own thinking and further explained:</p>
<p>My attitude is the attitude of a passerby. The so-called passerby is detached from hope, but looks down on complacency, reaction, and decadence; in other words, my obligation is only to point out the shortcomings of certain things. And the intention is, of course, to hope that the good aspects are more numerous.</p>
<p>This is of course also an understanding of old realism, but he is one step further than Shen Congwen. Although "my obligation is to point out the shortcomings of certain things," he understands that there are "preconceived notions" in this. In fact, a writer "without preconceived notions"</p>

<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"He's really a very handsome man."</p>
<p>"Do you think so?"</p>
<p>"Of course, and he seems like a happy person."</p>
<p>What strange demand made him suddenly tell the barmaid about Zhe'an receiving the inheritance? Why did this thought, which he didn't want to think about when he was alone, which he rejected because he was afraid of disturbing himself, run to his lips at this time? And why was he willing to let this thought run out of his lips, as if he needed to pour out his bitter heart again in front of something?</p>
<p>He said, putting one leg over the other:</p>
<p>"My brother is very lucky, he recently inherited an inheritance with an income of 20,000 francs a year."</p>
<p>She opened her blue, greedy eyes wide and said:</p>
<p>"Ah! But who gave him this inheritance? His grandmother, or his aunt?"</p>
<p>"Not at all, it was a friend of our family."</p>
<p>"Just a friend? That's impossible! And he didn't leave anything for you?"</p>
<p>"No. I'm not very familiar with this person."</p>
<p>She thought for a while, then a strange smile floated on her lips:</p>
<p>"Then! Your brother is fortunate to have this kind of friend! Really, no wonder he's not like you at all!"</p>
<p>He wanted to slap her, for reasons that he himself didn't understand. His mouth twitched and asked her:</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>She looked stupid and innocent:</p>
<p>"Me, nothing. I mean he has better opportunities than you."</p>
<p>He threw a lang on the table and left.</p>
<p>Now he silently repeated the sentence: "No wonder he's not like you at all."</p>
<p>What was she thinking, what was the hidden meaning in her words! There must be some cunning, malice, and humiliation in it. That's right, the girl must think Zhe'an is Maraisa's son.</p>
<p>Thinking that people suspected his mother's chastity, he was so moved that he stopped and looked around, wanting to find a place to sit down.</p>
<p>There was another coffee shop opposite him. He walked in, grabbed a chair and sat down. When the waiter ran over and asked him what he wanted, he replied, "A beer."</p>
<p>He felt his heart beating very hard: a chill ran down his skin in waves. Suddenly he remembered Malosco's words last night: "This will not end well." Did he and this low-class girl have the same thoughts, the same suspicions?</p>

<h3 id="e235">Finance Price and Exchange Rates for Silver Recede, Gold Market Improves by Three Dollars; Routine Half-Day Session Lacking Momentum <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The gold market rallied yesterday, but the half-day market situation was sluggish and difficult to invigorate. Initially, overseas silver prices in both the UK and the US declined, with the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange falling by varying degrees from four to six li. Exchange rates opened higher but then contracted. The price of London raw gold fell by one shilling and three pence. The US government's buying price for gold was $33.20, up five cents from the previous day. Stocks fell by $1.34. US wheat fell by two cents, while US cotton saw only slight fluctuations. The opening price for wool was $334, rising to $337, but due to fellow traders anticipating that the HSBC and American exchange rates would not shrink significantly, most people sold off, causing the gold price to stabilize at this point. After opening, the market was relatively stable, but because banks continued to sell actively, the exchange market eased, and large investors also unloaded frequently, making it difficult for the gold price to sustain. In addition, general sentiment was weak, and speculators Luo and Wu also provided supply, almost forcing the price to approach the $30 mark. The half-day situation was mediocre. After the market opened, Reuters reported that the US authorities had stipulated today that the domestic buying price for new mined gold should be lower than the world gold price in the hope of reversing the sharp decline of the US dollar. It also reported that the Dutch Prime Minister Colijn had declared that he would maintain the gold standard, causing the gold market to strengthen and rise, with the cash price at 1,115 yuan and the swap spread at 10 yuan. The half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $736.80, an improvement of $6.70 from the previous closing. Goods opened at $7. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of one shilling and three pence three seven five for the UK exchange rate and $32.4375 for the US exchange rate. Although Shunli Duanxing tried to advance, Hengyu Zhengchang Zhaofengchang sold off, retreating to $5.70. Hongli Yifeng Yongyuanmao Yong and others entered the market to buy, raising the price to $7.10. Shanghai bought the January US dollar at .875, but in an instant, Huabi came out with the January US dollar at .875. Daxing Yongbingxing unloaded, dropping the price to $5.50 again. It was anticipated that the HSBC list would shrink by .125 for the UK and .25 for the US. At this time, it was still possible to struggle around $6. Zhengjin offered the February US dollar at .125, and the January dollar at .9375. Hengxing Yuanmao Yonghengyu Hengtai Dacheng Zhifeng Yongbingxing Daxing Yong Zhaofengchang and others sold off together. Huabi offered the March US dollar at .4375, and Pan Gen offered half a yuan, dropping the price to $1.10. Tongtaichang Yidayong took advantage of the low price to purchase, and Zhengjin Anda also bought the March half yuan, briefly raising the price to $3. Shanghai offered the February US dollar at .3125, Zhongfu offered the January .125, and Yuanmao Yonghengyu sold off goods, dropping the price to .08 yuan. Hongli forcefully bought, rising back to just above $2. Huabi bought the January US dollar at .0625. It was difficult to maintain strength at that time. Others, including Hengyu Tongtaichang, competed to sell, rising to .49 yuan. Hua Jing offered $33 for the January dollar. Hongchang Dayong Dacheng continued to buy. After hovering, the noon close was $733.10. After the closing, although Hengxing Bingxing bought, they forcefully sold off goods, retreating to $2. The goods were auctioned at $1.80. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was $737.10 and the lowest was $730.80, a difference of $6.30. As a result, the closing price rose by $3 compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The listed price was reduced by .25 by HSBC for the American exchange rate, to $32.25, yielding a benchmark gold price of $744. According to the closing price, it was about $11 higher, three dollars higher than the previous closing. The logged-in price for this month was $741, and for December it was $733. The morning make-up water was $741, and the cash price was $1,115. Trading was still active on the floor. The Tianjin gang sold to their peers, including Tongfeng Yongyingfeng Heng, at prices ranging from $1,114.50 to $1,117. In addition, Dalian goods were also acquired by their peer Zhongna at prices ranging from $1,115.50 to $1,116.50. The total transaction volume for both was approximately 3,000 taels. Swaps were made by Dachencheng to Yingfenghang for seven lots, at a price of $10. There were still 1,232 lots remaining for this month.</p>
<p>Floor trading was flat. In summary, Shunli Ruixing Tongtaichang Yuanxing Yidayong Yuanmao Yongyuanchun Hongli Hengchang Yongdafa Yonghengxing and others were on the buying side, while Tongfenghang Henghengyu Fuchang Tongchun Zhifeng Yonghengtai Dachengchang Sheng Yongyifeng Yongzhaofengchang Hengxingyuan and others were on the selling side. Bingxing Zhengchang first sold and then bought. The Dalian gang Shunli jointly traded a little less than 2,600 lots, rolling in a little over 1,200 lots. Wanxing jointly traded a little over 1,900 lots, rolling in less than 100 lots. The Guangdong gang Hengxing rolled in a little over 200 lots, with a small number sold. There were a total of 30,282 lots of December chips.</p>
<p>Among traders (as of the 10th), short positions still slightly outnumbered long positions. Among the long positions, Wanxing had the largest position with a little over 6,400 lots, followed by Shunli with a little over 4,400 lots (the Dalian gang had a total long position of over 10,000 lots), Hengyu with a little over 3,000 lots, Fuyu with a little over 2,100 lots, and Fuchang Qianchangxiang with a little over 1,500 lots each, Tongfenghang with a little over 1,300 lots, Runchang with slightly less than 900 lots, and Yiyu Dafeng Hengyuanheng Yuanmao Yong with over 700 lots each, and Hongxing Yongfeng with 600 lots each.

<h3 id="e240">Securities Bond Market Fluctuates, Chips Seemingly Excessive, Short Struggle Ineffectively, Market Prices Rise and Fall, Future Outlook is Far From Optimistic <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange still had a fleeting and uncertain trend. Initially, it rose because Finance Minister Kong stated that there was a solution to the financial situation, and then it fell because large investors continued to sell. There was a constant regret in the market that the chips were far from sufficient. The market price struggled ineffectively, and the future outlook was difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday morning, the initial trading session was quite busy replenishing short positions, and No. 4 even bought, and the market price gradually rose. The trend gradually became energetic, with many rising by five or six jiao. After entering the session to the far term of the 20th level, due to the surging sales of the 21st and 33rd levels, the market price gradually felt unsustainable and suddenly showed cracks. After that, all items fell back, and the salt tax even fell by as much as four jiao. Market popularity turned sluggish again, and the bulls struggled ineffectively. In the second session, although No. 4 still bought, the 21st, 33rd, and northern gangs were all selling, so the market price could not be maintained, and it fell by three, five to six, seven jiao uniformly. Moreover, the number of gains in the initial session was not as much as the number of losses in the second session, and people's hearts became even more discouraged. There were fewer transactions in the afternoon. The opening prices varied, with gains and losses of about one or two jiao. The trend was chaotic, and the closing price slightly rebounded by one or two jiao, but the far-term salt tax still felt weak. The market price results were calculated to be one or two jiao to three or four jiao. However, the far term of the compilation and the near term of troop reduction at the 19th level were slightly better by one or two jiao. This was because of the different choices of bulls and bears in the swaps, so it slightly showed anomalies. The total transaction volume was 14,061,900, including 1,000 yuan in cash and a total of 5,490,000 in futures salt tax, 2,295,000 in troop reduction, 1,600,000 in the 19th level, 2,750,000 in the 20th level of the 20-volume, and the rest were from tens of thousands to two, forty thousand.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Tianjin Bank reported that the New York stock market on the 10th was stabilized by the US dollar, grains fell, and it was in a sluggish state, but the footing was still good. According to the Federal Reserve report, the reserve banks purchased government bonds last week for only 10 million yuan. According to another report, since October 20, the French banks have flowed out a total of 100 million gold francs. The railway freight published yesterday totaled 607,785 vehicles, an increase of 44,085 vehicles compared to last week. Regarding the silver rumors, it was heard that the Financial Stabilization Agency denied having plans to increase silver prices. The US Steel Company announced that it shipped a total of 572,897 tons of steel in October, a decrease of 2,264 tons compared to September. The total stock trading volume for the day was 1,370,000 shares. "Wheat" shrank due to fewer buyers and the week being large without a market for shrinking. The situation was still favorable to the bulls. "Cotton" bulls took profits, tending towards buyers, because the exchange rate between the UK and the US was stable, and they were hesitant to move forward. Manufacturers also bought less. The ups and downs of the market and the form of currency expansion are the main forces, and the basic elements of cotton are secondary. "Silver" fell because bulls took profits, but the public still realized silver and other gold to offset the devaluation of the US dollar. The Financial Stabilization Agency announced that the price of gold per tael was $33.20. Zhang Stearns was relieved afterward.</p>

<p>The yarn market remains flat and lifeless, with a bleak scene in the market. Since the restrictions were imposed in recent months, most speculators have been at a standstill. Currently, yarn customers are not selling well, but fine thread sales are particularly strong. Guangdong buyers have taken in six to seven hundred pieces, and the market price has suddenly risen by five or six yuan.</p>

<p>The people's list opened in the previous market, and the market atmosphere was still flat. Each rose by one, two, five, or six jiao. The afternoon market opened and was still strong, but it turned downstream after the second and third rounds. As a result, each month fell by one or two jiao.

<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and was flat in the afternoon, but the upward trend of US cotton has stopped. The demand for current cotton is still stagnant, and the factories still have no plans to move. The selling price of Tonghua is cheaper, but the amount of speculative purchases is still not relaxed, so the market has become a stalemate again.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm and stable due to foreign merchants buying and a lack of sellers. Later, it fell due to the conclusion of the liquidation of the large positions, and the result was that spot goods did not move, and the futures rose and fell by one or two pounds. British cotton spot goods fell by five points, futures fell by one to four points, Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by six points, and Indian cotton market was closed.

<p>New York, November 10th, reports on the condition of the cotton market over the past two weeks, saying that the government's cotton production report on the 3rd estimated a lower harvest than the average private estimate, so past transactions revealed a disappearance of uncertain weather. The cotton market had concluded a lot when the report numbers were released, and the price then rose. Due to the weakness of the US dollar and the step-by-step rise in gold prices, buying interest became stronger, and this phenomenon obviously revived talk of currency expansion. Buyers were even more excited by the firmness of the wheat market and the securities market. It is heard that farmers are hoarding cotton with the help of government loans, and that there are currently many farmers receiving loans in the next year's program to limit cotton fields to help with this. Recent cold and rain have delayed the listing of new cotton and damaged the cotton left in the fields. At the same time, the morale of many parties is quite strong, based on the decline of the US dollar and the cotton hoarding movement in the South. There are also some parties who do not want to buy in large quantities following the buying trend, because they want to wait for the future development of the business situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was already standing firm before the opening, because customer conversion had been very active in recent days, and the northern gang and northeastern gang had been very greedy to convert. More than one million bags have already been shipped out in recent days, and the back-end is still greedy. The market's recycled flour and third and fourth grade by-product flour were all searched empty. There were still purchases yesterday, so even though foreign wheat reported small, the market still stood firm. Following the short-selling offset and new multiple purchases, the market stepped up. This month once rose by three cents. In the afternoon, there were multiple parties and factories selling, and the far-term hedging sales were even stronger. The near-term was also small, but the current flour and the near-term standard northern sales were still large. As a result, this month is still large by 1.75 cents, next month is again large by 1 cent, January is large by half a cent, February is large by .25, and March is small by half a cent, and April is unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Term Wheat Follows Marked Flour and Rises <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, foreign wheat was consistently reported as small, and each month was soft. Following the sharp rise in the flour market, the current flour was active, and the current wheat followed suit. The short-selling offset, the traders no longer exited, and scattered new multiples and external customers all bought, so each month rose consistently around noon. Later, due to the large amount of current wheat chips this month, some of the multiples exited again, and the price turned flat again. The closing price for this month was unchanged, December was up two cents, January was up six cents, February was up two cents, and March and April were each up four cents. The current wheat factory conversion was very active. It is estimated that Yaowan wheat opened at four yuan, and Yangzhou wheat opened at three yuan eight jiao two cents. Each grade of medium and secondary was reduced accordingly, totaling 2,000 bags, which was handled by Fuxin.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was more than 30 numbers, totaling about 4,340 shi. The initial market opened with the local street transaction going for a total of more than 3,000 shi. The market shape seemed to have an upward trend, but suddenly there were few working guests, and the way out was suddenly dull. The market conditions suddenly turned downward, changing the attitude of the early market. The sellers were extremely fighting, and as a result, a stable situation was achieved, so the prices of Changbang Su Tong and other japonica, and Nangang and other thick rice were not honored or dishonored, but the Du Jian rice was strong due to rare and strong stomachs, and the price was good by one foot, and the Yang Jian rice was also flat. There were 1,560 bags of the Qingjiao Fenglian and other late rice that the wrapping stomach continued to do, but because the Kakeya eating plate was harsh, the market price was difficult to stand and fell by nearly one foot. The Bingyin Yuan Wine households are quite prosperous, and the market color continues to be excellent.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 48 or 49 ships from various roads down the river. In the market, Bai Yuan wine households initially handled 4500 shi, and Yang Jian wrapped up 7800 bags, and the market shape of the new japonica was tight in the early market and settled in the late market. The price of Yang Jian Baiyuan was increased by Jiao Xu, and the price of broken japonica Du Bu Kakeya was sharp and stable. There are many early thin Bingyin rice, and the price fell by more than Jiao Yu.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the customer glaze foreign rice customer conversion was slightly active. The local hoarding households immediately retreated, so although the market was lively, the market price only saw a tight lead, and there was no further expansion. Northern helping such as Fuzhou Quanzhou Ningbo have all been inquiring, especially since there are more exits from Beiyang. The Tianjin Gang, because the sales of powdered rice and miscellaneous grains have been active there recently, has repeatedly come to the city to inquire about market prices. Yesterday, the banker gave 1,500 bags of Hunan Jinggang rice to the Jinggang, and Quanzhou also handled 200 to 300 bags, priced at six yuan, one jiao and a half to six yuan, one jiao, and second-grade five yuan, seven jiao and a half. Quanzhou also took 194 bags of Jing-branded Xian from the capital city, and 140 bags of Jiangbei Xian. Fuzhou took 140 bags of Hunan Ji Jing, and the market price did not increase much compared to the previous market. Yong Bang also took 200 bags of small twisted rice, priced at seven yuan, one jiao and a half, which was slightly better than the previous opening, so the price was one jiao higher.</p>

<h3 id="e256">An Important Matter That the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Should Pay Attention To <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>Many of the readers of this publication are friends in the industrial and commercial sectors. The reporter feels that the industrial and commercial sectors have recently discovered an important matter. I wonder if people in these sectors have paid close attention to it? That is the issue of domestic sales of Chinese goods actually encountering opposition from Chinese people. Observing the dispute between the Zhuangke (lodging agents) of the Sanshan Guildhall in Shanghai, established by Fujian merchants, and the Chinese National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, as well as the news of Xuzhou merchants preventing the National Products Circulation Promotion Group from promoting national products in Xuzhou, is enough to cause endless worry and doubt about the future of industry and commerce. Although the background to the occurrence of this phenomenon is complex, it further exposes an obvious fact that Chinese industry and commerce cannot have greater development in the face of intense dumping of foreign goods. As for the point of attention we should give to this matter, it is not about who is right and who is wrong between the National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association and the Sanshan Guildhall, but to explore the fundamental reasons why national industrial capital cannot develop.</p>
<p>Examining the origin of the so-called Zhuangke established by inland merchants from various provinces in Shanghai in the past, it was originally for purchasing foreign goods rather than selling national goods. As for local products (now known as national goods), most of them were traded locally, without the need for any Zhuangke. Later, because the sales of foreign goods became greater day by day, various so-called "national goods" made from foreign goods and improved local products emerged. Recently, general national goods have been manufactured effectively, and because of their lower prices, they can recover part of the inland market previously held by foreign goods. However, to facilitate the installation of machinery and the turnover of capital, most national goods factories are established in Shanghai, so the inland Zhuangke, originally established to purchase foreign goods, now also purchase national goods based on the principle of profitability.</p>
<p>The main cause of this dispute is not actually that the Zhuangke of the Sanshan Guildhall oppose the promotion of national goods, but that the Zhuangke's profits depend entirely on the benefit of reselling goods. Now that the Production and Sales Cooperation Association directly transports goods to Fujian to sell, it takes away the original benefits of the Zhuangke. Therefore, from the perspective of merchants seeking profit, it is only natural that the Zhuangke oppose it. But what we should pay attention to is that if the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors do not quickly break this abnormal phenomenon during this time of intense competition from the dumping of foreign goods, then we will see that foreign goods can pass unhindered in the country, and if there is any obstruction, they will use cannons as weapons to break all obstacles, while national goods will not be able to be sold. If this continues, will the Chinese not truly be forever miserable people?</p>
<p>In practice, national goods factories should be widely established in various inland provinces, using local materials (raw materials, labor) for manufacturing, and promoting sales locally, which is a common phenomenon in other industrialized countries. Now, because our politics are not on track, most inland provinces suffer from natural disasters and man-made calamities every year, with bandits everywhere, rural economies are increasingly bankrupt, purchasing power is declining, and productivity is shrinking. As a result, no one dares to invest in establishing factories in the inland areas, and all new industries are concentrated in Shanghai. But what our industrial and commercial sectors should deeply realize is that this situation can only be maintained temporarily and is not a long-term plan. If we do not urgently seek remedies, then the miserable Chinese may not become slaves to a foreign country, but they will not be able to avoid becoming dead . So how should we rescue this dangerous situation? Should we just resign ourselves to fate and wait for death? These are all important matters that we should pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e257">The Chattering Yellow Birds <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Tangdi</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, the west wind is blowing loudly. In the city, people, except for the penniless poor fellows, have all put on coats and camel hair. Foreign expatriate ladies may even have fox fur around their necks. Signs for "Yangcheng Lake Crabs" are everywhere in the market, with advertisements for one yuan each jumping before people's eyes: gourmets are naturally feasting, because they have "money" as a backing, but what about the penniless people? They can only swallow their cravings into their stomachs.</p>
<p>Following the "Crabs" that come on the market in this late autumn and early winter are the "Yellow Birds." When the rice grains are full in the fields in late autumn, the Yellow Birds become extremely active, regardless of how much blood and sweat the farmers have shed, regardless of whether they have to repay the landlords, and even regardless of whether they have to rely on this meager food to support their wives and daughters. All they do is "chatter" and eat the crops bare. The Yellow Birds also come in flocks, so eating them once is a great loss.</p>
<p>The farmers hate them. On the one hand, when it is time to harvest, they send people to guard the fields. On the other hand, they think of various ways to catch and kill these harmful creatures.</p>
<p>The farmers' capture of Yellow Birds has formed a kind of income in late autumn, but the hardship is enough to endure. The sun is still on the horizon, and the birds are singing hoarsely as they return to their nests. The Yellow Birds, of course, also want to run to their nests. Yellow Birds live in groups. Their nests are always deep in the reeds, so when dusk is approaching, the farmers are already waiting in secluded places. Waiting until they see the "clues," they are still not at ease. They slowly approach the reeds and go to the bank to observe. Only after careful observation and making sure that there are no errors do they go home to prepare. After preparing the necessary equipment for catching birds, they eat a full meal and then start dressing up. The so-called "dressing up" here is definitely not like the city women putting on powder and rouge before going out, nor is it like gentlemen tidying up their hats and clothes. It is just for the convenience of work that they open the buttons of their chest clothes, tie a thick board belt around their waist, take off their shoes and wear straw sandals, and bring the necessary equipment (the equipment is also very simple, but it is a long-handled silk net bucket and a dim kerosene lamp), and set off to the destination.</p>
<p>The water in the reed ponds in late autumn and early winter is probably a foot deep, not to mention the cold that penetrates to the bones. Sometimes there are also things like snakes lurking in it. But the farmers who are determined to make a living are not afraid of these. They quietly and silently step by step through the reeds, the water reaching their knees, but they do not care at all. They reach the place they have been watching, holding their breath, leaning on the reeds, and shining the dim kerosene lamp. As soon as they see their "target," they are overjoyed and hurriedly put the long-handled silk net bucket over it. Whether it is three or four birds in one net, they are all immediately strangled and placed on their exposed chest. If they are slightly careless, if even a single Yellow Bird makes a sound, all the others will escape. At this time, not only will they not catch anything themselves, but they will also implicate their companions, who will return empty-handed.</p>
<p>With skilled techniques and dexterity, a farmer can sell his catch for one or two thousand coins in one night. Although it is not enough for a bottle of champagne in a city lady's dance hall, it is a huge income for a farmer.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Basement <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shulin</p>
<p>Because of the flood, we had to leave our hometown and flee. But where to flee to? Everywhere was flooded.</p>
<p>A foreign sampan came breaking through the waves, with a small red triangular flag of the ×× Church Refugee Relief Team fluttering at the stern and a guard holding a box cannon standing at the bow. We, a large group, originally wanted to rush forward (who wouldn't want to)? Around us was endless water, and a relief ship was coming), but looking at the cold little eyes of the box cannon, some people shouted a few times and then fell silent.</p>
<p>I can't remember how I was dragged onto the ship. When I woke up, I was already at the riverside of × port. The ship stopped, and we were all driven into freight cars, like bundles of goods. Li Axing, who had never ridden in a car before, vomited on someone in the shaking and rocking.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the ×× Church's ×× Association, we were placed in a basement room, packed full, lying down. After a while, a doctor in white came and said he was there for quarantine. I dragged the primary school student Yang Kai, wanting to go out and see the street scene, but was stopped at the gate. At this time, someone was asking and answering each other:</p>
<p>A: "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>B: "Upstairs to take a bath..."</p>
<p>Yang Kai and I both felt that we had taken baths in the water, but thinking about the stuffiness and heat on the ship and the musty smell in the basement, we both felt that it would be so nice to take a bath. We said in unison: "Let's go take a bath," and followed B into the elevator. But just as the elevator was about to close, a tall, thin person suddenly dragged us both out and asked where we were going.</p>
<p>"To take a bath," we said.</p>
<p>"Where do you live?" the man asked.</p>
<p>"In the basement."</p>
<p>"You think so highly of yourself," the man said with a sneer, "Do you know who can go upstairs? It costs three dollars a day!"</p>
<p>"Doesn't ×× preach equality and fraternity?" Yang Kai said bluntly.</p>
<p>"Humph!" the man widened his eyes, "There's nothing to say, you better know your place!"</p>
<p>"If we can't take a bath, why are you so fierce?" Yang Kai said angrily.</p>
<p>We couldn't take a bath, and we couldn't go out the door, so we had to go back to the basement again.</p>
<p>After a while, that tall guy came with a policeman, found me and Yang Kai, grabbed us by the collars, and shouted: "Get out! We don't want you living here!" We were silently pushed out the door, and in silence, we looked back at the face of that tall, Western-style building of compassionate benevolence.</p>

<p>— Duan Gu Xiang</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was born into a poor family. When I was three or four years old, I heard my mother say: My father lost all of our ten acres of land because of his tobacco shop business! There was no other way, so he ran to Henan to become a soldier. Later, my older brother also followed him. This was during the "Marshal Wu" era. At that time, because I was too young, I couldn't carry a gun, so I missed the road of wearing "two-and-a-half-foot" uniforms and "eating big cakes."</p>
<p>There was no land at home to maintain our livelihood, so my mother took me to the city. I worked as a "maid" in a household, doing things like washing clothes, taking care of children, and buying vegetables, busy from morning to night without stopping! I, too, swept the guest rooms for them in the morning, brought wash water... In the evening, I waited for the mistress and master to come home, because they would go to the movies or the theater every day. As soon as the master saw me sitting down for a moment, he would stare at me with his frighteningly white eyes! Scolding me, cursing me: such a lazy little child! What good are you! I remember my head often being beaten by him until I was dizzy!</p>
<p>I messed around like this for three or four years. My desire for knowledge grew higher day by day. Whenever I saw the apple of their eyes—their little son—go to school or come back, I would feel an indescribable sadness and envy the children who could go to school; they were truly happy! Especially when I was twelve years old, I had to send the "little master" to school every day and then pick him up. Looking at the countless children in the school, the itchy feeling in my heart was really unbearable! I asked my mother several times, saying that I wanted to go to school and didn't want to suffer here anymore, but my mother didn't allow it and said sternly: "Where would the money come from! You'll starve to death outside!"</p>
<p>When I heard this, I became very angry. I always thought my mother's temper was too strange. As soon as the "little master" came back, the mistress would hug him and kiss him, calling him good boy, good boy, endlessly. I couldn't understand why my mother had such a cruel heart!</p>
<p>The normal school student who lived in the west wing happened to be on winter vacation at the time of my distress. We got along very well and often joked together. I often bought him things, so he especially liked me. As soon as we met, I would tell him about these problems, explaining that I was very willing to recognize a few characters and be able to write an account. But I was penniless, so what could I do?</p>
<p>He said: "It is true that studying requires money, but for someone his age, as long as he can work hard and study on his own after finishing his work, he can also make progress and acquire considerable knowledge. He also generously said: "When you have nothing to do in the evening, I can teach you to recognize two characters, as long as you are willing! Nothing is difficult in the world if you set your mind to it!"</p>
<p>He gave me a Thousand Character Classic and taught me to write and read every day. I would read the characters whenever I had nothing to do, and I would also practice writing on paper or on the ground. However, just when I was learning, either the master would have something to call me to do, or his classmates would come to find him to play. These things made me feel very annoyed, but I didn't lose heart because of this and continued to move forward.</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and the winter vacation was over, so I stopped studying. But he was very concerned about me and told me to ask the master to allow me to go to the people's night school to study between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. every night, because everyone had finished eating at this time, and the mistress and master would not return until 12:00 a.m., so there was nothing to do. If not, then simply break free and not bury my youthful body entirely in this place. I could do some small business to maintain my livelihood and go to the people's school at night to study.</p>
<p>My heart was moved by him. Surprisingly, I had enough courage to talk to the master that night. The result was a few cold laughs, and he said, "You eat, drink, and take money, and you still don't want to work!" He had a very contemptuous attitude. At that time, I was really furious and broke with the master. My mother was also fired. From then on, we began a new life.</p>
<p>I rented a thatched cottage outside the city, and my mother washed and mended clothes for the soldiers living in the nearby Guandi Temple every day. I did some small seasonal business, such as buying peanuts and melon seeds, and in the evening, I went to the people's night class to study. This continued for four years, and then I worked at the school for two more years.</p>
<p>Recalling the difficult life when my mother was occasionally sick, the freezing cold conditions, and the victory of the glorious lecture meeting, now that I can write letters and read vernacular books and newspapers, comparing these two situations, it is indeed very meaningful. Although I have suffered thousands of hardships in the past, I have certainly achieved considerable success. From this, it can be known that without resolute hard work, it is absolutely impossible to complete one's own and the public's cause and to obtain the joy of victory.</p>

<p>— A recording of Mr. Dong Xian Guang's Speech by Zhu Yu</p>
<p>1.  The Inevitability of the Russo-Japanese War: Since September 18th, Japan has advanced and occupied the entirety of Southern Manchuria, thereby sharing a border of thousands of miles with Soviet Russia. Initially, the Japanese were extremely cautious. When Ma Zhanshan's troops held the Nenjiang Bridge, the Japanese repeatedly assured the Soviets that they would not cross the bridge. However, the frenzied Japanese soldiers paid no heed and soon occupied Qiqihar. The Japanese then used their silver tongue to declare that they would not cross the Chinese Eastern Railway. Subsequent events revealed that the Japanese army not only crossed the Chinese Eastern Railway but also drove straight into Manzhouli, forcing Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen's troops into Russian territory. By this point, the Japanese saw that Soviet Russia was as docile as a lamb, unable to resist, and their previous cautious and humble attitude, fearing offense, underwent a major transformation. From then on, their ambition grew, and they focused on seizing the Chinese Eastern Railway, rebuilding it to directly connect Korea and Manzhouli, thereby facilitating military transportation.</p>
<p>In addition, three more issues deserve our attention: (1) The Japanese Navy has always dominated the Western Pacific. All important ports are in its hands. When Japan presented China with the Twenty-One Demands, it forbade China from leasing any port to another country as a naval base in the future. The long-term intentions are evident! Now, in the Western Pacific, only the Soviet's Vladivostok is a cause for concern. Once developed, it would be a formidable rival to Japan. Therefore, they must occupy this important base of the Soviet Navy. This alone is enough to be the spark for a future Russo-Japanese War! (2) The Sakhalin Island issue. After the last Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese demanded that Russia cede the island and secretly sent geologists to survey it. The results indicated that the island's oil fields were all in the south, so the Japanese gained the southern part of the island, fully expecting to acquire a treasure trove. Who knew that ten years later, another survey revealed that the oil fields were all in the northern part of the island, which remained in Soviet hands. One can imagine their frustration! This is something that they must obtain, making it worthy of a war. (Note: The oil field theory was mentioned by Admiral Du Xigui to Japanese senior naval officers when he went to Japan to investigate the navy a few years ago, and it is considered credible.) (3) Currently, the border between Soviet Russia and Japan stretches for thousands of miles, and conflicts can occur at any time. The Soviet army can invade Manzhouli at any moment. Therefore, the Japanese are trying to drive them beyond Lake Baikal to develop Southern Manchuria with peace of mind. If these three things cannot be achieved, the three northeastern provinces will never develop. Everyone has the impression of a future Russo-Japanese War. Which capitalist would be willing to invest? With the intensity of modern aerial bombing, a city can be destroyed in five or six days. For the sake of stabilizing people's hearts and promoting the prosperity of Southern Manchuria, the Japanese must fight a war. Otherwise, after making many sacrifices and seizing Manchuria, what benefits would there be?</p>
<p>2.  War Preparations on Both Sides: Since the completion of the railway section between Dunhua and Jihui, Manchuria has been able to directly connect with Korea, reducing transportation time by twenty-four hours, greatly improving convenience. In the future, if the Japanese successfully purchase the Chinese Eastern Railway and rebuild it, it will be even more seamless and efficient. However, this is unlikely to happen. The Russians may resolutely refuse. Currently, Japanese officers, especially in the army, tell their soldiers every day that their hypothetical enemy is Soviet Russia, and the army is filled with anti-Russian sentiment, just as the United States is their hypothetical enemy in the navy. Most of the Japanese army is being trained in the northern regions. They train in sub-zero temperatures with very thin clothing, resulting in many deaths and injuries. However, once training is completed, the results will be impressive. Of course, this is also specially prepared against Russia, because the main Russo-Japanese war will undoubtedly be in Siberia and the northern Manchuria area. Japanese Army Minister Araki recently requested the government to issue 100 million yuan in public bonds to manufacture sophisticated military equipment, with special emphasis on chemical warfare, which has made great progress in the past two or three years. One-third of the 100 million yuan is used for this. At the same time, the troops stationed in Manchuria were all placed under the command of the Kwantung Army Headquarters to achieve unified command. On one hand, they recruit and train Japanese, Russians, and Cossacks to prepare for war. Turning to the Soviet side: they are actively manufacturing submarines and destroyers in the Heihe area, with the obvious intention of attacking the Japanese Navy. Recently, the actions of merchant ships in Vladivostok have been monitored to prevent the leakage of secrets, and many forts have been built there, suitable for both offense and defense. The double track of the Siberian Railway has been completed. It is said that the reason for the Russian failure in the last Russo-Japanese War was the slow single-track transportation, so the impact of this is undoubtedly significant. Two and a half months ago, the Soviet Army Chief of Staff personally inspected the Heihe area in the Far East, showing the extreme tension of the situation. Currently, there are between 300 and 500 Soviet military aircraft on the Far Eastern border. The number of troops is unknown, but I estimate that it is around 200,000 to 300,000.</p>
<p>3.  When Will the Soviet-Japanese War Break Out? No one can say for sure. It may break out tomorrow. It seems that Japan will always launch the attack first. Soviet Russia will never take the offensive. The Japanese secret document released by the Russian side on the tenth of last month stated: The Japanese government sent personnel to Changchun to secretly instruct the Manchurian authorities to not rush into a challenge against Russia, and it would be best to launch the attack in the spring of 1935. From this, it seems that war may not break out within a year. The day before yesterday, a newspaper reported that eight or nine Japanese military aircraft flew into Soviet Russia to conduct reconnaissance. Such incidents are most likely to cause misunderstandings and conflicts. If the Russian side shoots down one or two with anti-aircraft guns, war may be imminent. At the same time, both sides have intelligence agents in Tokyo and Manchuria conducting secret work. If one or two are arrested and executed, there is a risk of war breaking out. Some say that the war will definitely break out this December or next spring, because winter warfare is most suitable in Siberia, but this is just speculation. In about a month or two, there should be a new development in Russo-Japanese relations, depending on whether the negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway continue. At that time, both sides will make their final and greatest decisions!</p>

<p>— Si Cheng</p>
<p>We, a group of young people, are dropouts driven out by aristocratic schools. When we hold back our tears, clench our fists, and embark on the road of society, it is clear that the pressure of life and the monotony of work gradually deprive us of the opportunity to seek knowledge. However, on the other hand, in our professional lives, we can experience practical life experience. If at the same time we do not give up our spare time for self-study, and we adequately connect our book learning with our practical life experiences, the improvement we make will be far beyond what a "hotel-like" school could provide.</p>
<p>But we have felt that it is very difficult to study alone. People whose willpower is not firm often lose perseverance. Because of various social obstacles and temptations, a young person entering society is most likely to lose their original courage and let themselves decline. This can be said to be the most common phenomenon in our group. Even if one is not tempted by society and can persevere in overcoming difficulties, studying alone is often tedious and insufficient. Of course, progress is very slow. I have discussed these difficulties with many friends, and as a result, we came up with a very good solution. This method has been of great benefit to us to this day, so I dare to write it out and tell every friend who is struggling to study on their own.</p>
<p>This is not a difficult thing. Organize colleagues in your workplace or nearby friends who are studying the same subject into a small group. This small group does not need any funding or procedures, just a weekly meeting. During this meeting, we decide on the various problems that everyone will study in the following week. During this week, each person's self-study should focus on the specified problem (naturally, the specified question)</p>
<p>The problems need to be raised by each person and passed by everyone). The following week, everyone reports on what they have learned. Of course, this cannot be completely consistent. Thus, we can debate based on our own insights and provide the most complete answer to the specified problem (if it cannot be resolved in one meeting, it is moved to the next meeting). At the same time, we decide on the various problems that should be studied next time.</p>
<p>In this way, we can not only gain rapid understanding and progress through debate, but also solve the tediousness and insufficiency of self-study, and make our self-study become systematic learning. At the same time, we can spend a Sunday with nothing to do and benefit greatly. I believe that whether you are studying literature, social science, or natural science, you can use this method appropriately. On the other hand, you can also gain significant benefits in practicing speaking and cultivating team spirit. We can even call it "Our University."</p>
<p>In short, use the spirit of the group to generate the correct power to drive everyone forward, and each person becomes a part of the group, creating this group, making it powerful, and enabling each person to achieve effective self-study and increase the rate of self-study.</p>
<p>I hope that "Our Universities" exist everywhere.</p>

<p>— Bai Shi An</p>
<p>Yunnan Pu'er Correspondence</p>
<p>Because farmers in my hometown are suffering from economic oppression and rural bankruptcy, they are gradually changing from small landlords and rich peasants to middle peasants, from middle peasants to small peasants, and from tenant farmers to hired laborers. As for the lives of ordinary farmers, it is simply inhumane. A year of hard work is truly braving the wind and rain, and working under the stars and moon. The working hours can be said to be infinitely long, at least more than twelve hours. With such long working hours, their daily income must be considerable. But the facts tell us the exact opposite. Ordinary farmers grow wheat and cotton, but they mostly eat coarse grains, wear tattered clothes, and live in thatched huts. Except for festivals and special banquets, it is not easy to have meat. Farmers who are slightly more prosperous have at least two meals of porridge a day; the poor do not even have rice for three meals a day. In the event of a famine or unexpected natural or man-made disasters, it is even worse, and they cannot even get enough coarse grain porridge. As a last resort, they have no choice but to borrow at high interest, sell their wives and children, or sell all their plows, cattle, and household implements. If they still cannot survive, then wild fern roots, yams, tree leaves, and garlic are the only food to fill their stomachs. The old and weak cannot even find these, so they can only starve to death. My grandmother often said to me, "The world is not right now. In the past, which family didn't have grain stored in the granary after the autumn harvest? Which family didn't have over a hundred strings of cash to spend for the New Year? Now, most people are 'renting cattle to farm the land, and then encountering natural disasters.' Fifteen or sixteen years ago, the fields in this village and section always belonged to the people who farmed them. Those who could pay the grain tax were so powerful!" Indeed! Eighty percent of the good paddy fields in our village have now gone into the hands of wealthy people in the city.</p>
<p>Schools are important places, but the poor are not allowed to enter. Farmers are born without the opportunity to study, so their knowledge is naturally lacking. Therefore, local bullies and gentry can seize and take from the farmers as they please, running businesses with their surplus loan capital! Farmers must use their houses or farmland as collateral when borrowing money, and the interest rate is five to six percent. If they borrow one dan of grain, they must return two dan when repaying it. When farmers need to use oxen for plowing, they must exchange their labor for the landlord's cattle to plow their own fields. As for the land rented to farmers, the amount of rent paid is approximately half of the total production capacity of the land. In the event of floods, droughts, insect plagues, wind disasters, or epidemics, the harvest is often reduced to 50% or less, or even no harvest at all. In addition, as the number of poor people increases daily, bandits and thieves rise up, so the cultivated land shrinks daily, and no one dares to cultivate it.</p>
<p>The fields of ordinary small landlords and rich peasants suffer a large reduction in annual income because tenants do not dare to cultivate them. Many fields are even left barren and unattended. Plains of tens of acres are still natural wilderness. On the other hand, due to the increasing economic aggression from the outside world, most of the daily necessities are purchased from foreign goods, especially clothing-related goods. This kind of foreign economic aggression naturally has a direct impact on the more affluent small landlords and rich peasants, causing them to suffer great economic losses and gradually become impoverished. As for the heavy taxes, taking only the land tax as an example, the land tax on the same land is now more than thirty times higher than it was thirty years ago, and all kinds of miscellaneous taxes and special taxes are innumerable, such as slaughter tax, live cattle tax, cattle slaughter reporting fees, special education funds, underworld money surcharges, deed tax surcharges, tobacco and alcohol surcharges, grain tax, militia fees, rural cleaning fees, apportionment fees, household registration fees, deed verification tax, weighing tax... and so on. The result of this increased taxation is naturally a fatal blow to the landlords. Due to these various reasons, there is no way for ordinary small landlords to avoid going down the road of bankruptcy. As a result of bankruptcy, small landlords naturally cannot afford the land tax and miscellaneous taxes, and no one dares to cultivate the land. Even if they cultivate it themselves, the value of the harvest is not enough to offset the loss of land tax and taxes due to natural and man-made disasters. Undoubtedly, ordinary people do not dare to buy this large amount of land either. Because small landlords and rich peasants cannot get any benefit anyway, in order to avoid the extortion and persecution of corrupt officials, they have no choice but to cut it off with pain. People often send Tian Dan to the City God Temple and hang him on the Buddha cabinet of the City God. Therefore, the land in my hometown has gradually become the property owned by the City God.</p>
<p>This is not lamenting the decline, but just a page of the reality of decline.</p>

<h3 id="e264">"Thrift and Savings" vs. "Timely Purchases" <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yong</p>
<p>"Thrift and savings" is naturally a treasure worth telling your younger brother and father telling his son. Especially for us young fellows under the wings of our employers, we should regard it as the "golden rule," because our employers often stroke the sparse short stubble on their chins and say to us very proudly: "When I was as old as you, I didn't earn as much salary as you do now, but I squeezed out a fraction of my monthly salary and saved it. Later, it accumulated more and more, so I partnered with others to open a shop, gradually developed, and opened my own shop, and then opened several shops alone. If you can be as thrifty and saving as I am, I guarantee that you will have a bigger business than I did before you reach my age."</p>
<p>On the reverse side of "thrift and savings" is "timely purchases." If "thrift and savings" is generally recognized as the secret to wealth, then "timely purchases" is, needless to say, undoubtedly a recipe for "not having food to eat." But I heard that the "recession" of the American empire was caused by the people's unwillingness to make "timely purchases." Originally, producers work hard to produce, relying on someone to consume. If producers produce a large number of products, but consumers do not make "timely purchases," then producers will have to reduce or stop production due to the stagnation of capital and the accumulation of goods. Under these actions of reducing and stopping production, there is no doubt that many employees of production enterprises will lose part or all of their purchasing power. Thus, the products produced by the producers will naturally suffer an even greater blow. Under this recession situation, the American empire saw the novel spectacle of President Hoover advising the people to make "timely purchases." It is said that if every citizen of the American empire could spend all the money they have in the bank and the wages they earn every week without hesitation to buy things, then in the near future, the American empire could see the prosperity of 1929 again, and every citizen would no longer experience the panic of bread.</p>
<p>"Thrift and savings" is a great principle, and "timely purchases" also sounds logical. Everyone has their own reasons. Although these two hats are not the same size, they are equally comfortable when worn on the head. What kind of logic is this in economics? It is really a bit incomprehensible. Now let's put aside the logic of economics and study whether the path of "thrift and savings" or the path of "timely purchases" is wider and easier to walk in China, a backward and semi-colonial country.</p>
<p>In this backward production, semi-colonial country whose entire economic organization is dominated by imperialism, it is naturally impossible to talk about any economic policy that can save the current economic crisis. In today's year of global recession, there is no need for China to be polite, and it is inevitable to come up with a set of "sluggish sales" tricks. In the United States, perhaps "timely purchases" can activate the funds of various enterprises. If we also follow suit and play this game, and recklessly make "timely purchases," wouldn't that still result in turning the people's savings in savings banks into boxes and boxes of silver dollars and shipping them overseas? If we yellow-faced Chinese also learned from the Americans and spent the only five cents in our pockets to buy a glass of beer, then people would not need to make "timely purchases" anyway. They only need to dump all the unsold goods on this Far Eastern market, and they would not be afraid of easily saving the recession and returning to prosperity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the American empire advocates "timely purchases" to save the crisis. If China advocates "timely purchases," it is tantamount to cutting off its own flesh to feed the tiger. People would "swallow it whole without the slightest politeness."</p>
<p>Since the path of "timely purchases" is impassable, then let's take the path of "thrift and savings." Although in this period of social system turbulence and transformation, we dare not dream of becoming "small capitalists" through "thrift and savings," and becoming "big capitalists" from "small capitalists," but society is so chaotic and unorganized, human relationships are so cold, and the world economy has collapsed to such an extent that the demon of unemployment is baring its fangs and claws and preparing to break everyone's lifeline. Isn't "thrift and savings" a "storing grain against famine" plan among our limited passive methods?</p>
<p>Therefore, in the United States, it is really qualified to shout the slogan of "timely purchases" to save the economy of the entire American empire. But in this semi-colonial country whose economic organization is completely dominated by imperialism, I think it is more appropriate to take "thrift and savings" with the individual as the starting point as the slogan.</p>

<h3 id="e265">Shuttlecock <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zheng</p>
<p>(1) Benefits of Kicking Shuttlecock</p>
<p>Kicking shuttlecock is almost a full-body exercise, involving the head, neck, waist, legs, and feet. Practicing in the late autumn and early winter weather is especially suitable. If you can persevere and practice for tens of minutes every morning, in addition to being able to temporarily resist the cold, practicing for a few months will guarantee that your body parts will have unexpected development, which is no less than practicing Baduanjin.</p>
<p>(2) Shuttlecock Manufacturing</p>
<p>It is no longer possible to verify when the shuttlecock was invented. The raw materials for manufacturing a shuttlecock are a piece of soft leather, a duck feather tube, a few chicken feathers, and a large copper coin. First, cut the soft leather into two circular pieces the size of a copper coin, sandwich the copper coin in the middle, and sew along the edges. Then, cut one end of the duck feather tube into a three-pronged shape, sew it in the center of the soft leather, and insert the chicken feathers. Leather shoe stores on the market often sell this kind of shuttlecock, with prices ranging from about four to eight copper coins.</p>
<p>(3) Shuttlecock Kicking Skills and Names</p>
<p>Shuttlecock kicking skills are divided into two categories: "Eight Bigs" and "Eight Smalls." "Eight Bigs" means kicking with one foot while the other foot is also off the ground. "Eight Smalls" also means kicking with one foot while the other foot does not leave the ground. I only know the sounds of the following names, so I will write them out using characters with similar sounds and meanings. If there are any mistakes, please readers correct me.</p>
<p>"Eight Bigs"</p>
<p>(1) Guàn (Guàn is the easiest of the eight bigs. It involves using one foot behind the other to kick the shuttlecock high, and both feet must leave the ground at the same time.)</p>
<p>(2) Guì (Bend one leg into a kneeling position in the crook of the other leg and kick the shuttlecock high.) (Note: Do not kick with the bent leg.)</p>
<p>(3) Yì (Place the sole of one foot on the other leg’s crook and kick the shuttlecock high) (Note: same as above)</p>
<p>(4) Zé (Stack both feet forward and use the foot below to kick the shuttlecock high.)</p>
<p>(5) Piě (Kick the shuttlecock over one leg, then use the other leg to kick the shuttlecock high.) (Note: Kick the shuttlecock high in front of the body, not beside it.)</p>
<p>(6) Guòmén Guàn (Cross the shuttlecock over one leg, action is the same as Guàn)</p>
<p>(7) Guòmén Guì (Cross the shuttlecock over one leg, action is the same as Guì)</p>
<p>(8) Guòmén Yì (Cross the shuttlecock over one leg, action is the same as Yì)</p>
<p>The first four consecutive movements are called "Four Great Kings"; eight consecutive movements are called "Eight Great Heavenly Kings"; the last three consecutive movements are called "Three Crossing the Door"; Guàn</p>
