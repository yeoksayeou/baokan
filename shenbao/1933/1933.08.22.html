<p>汪精衛報告黃河災情與棉麥借欵案　　陳立夫講演生活資料之貧乏與補充　　(南京)　中央二十一日晨八時舉行九十三次紀念週、到中委陳立夫·葉楚傖·谷正綱·蕭忠貞·李次溫·洪陸東、及職員等共六百人、葉楚傖主席、陳立夫報告、題爲「生活資料之貧乏與其補充、」大意謂此次到湘鄂贛三省、見到各地社會情形、極爲窮困、完全由於生活資料之缺乏、生產力量不夠、加以分配方法不均匀、致社會經濟組織崩潰、亦即是未能實現總理民生主義、全體同志均應負責、全國智識份子今後均各應貢獻其智力、到農村去扶助人民、以發展農工業增加社會生產力量、不應再集中城市而成爲消耗者、尤其是本黨同志、應遵照總理遺敎、	喚起民族固有之精神、使人民精神與物質各種慾望均能滿足、並樹立人民自信力組織力與生產力、然後社會基礎方能鞏固、國家方能復興、（二十一日中央社電）</p>
<p>(南京)　國府廿一晨九時舉行紀念週、到汪兆銘·賀耀組·黃慕松·朱家驊·王用賓·林翔·陳紹寬·呂超·魏懐·彭學沛·曾仲鳴·曁國府職員等共五百餘人、林主席領導行禮、汪院長報告、這一週間的事情、關於政治方面、如華北戰區接收問題、察哈爾問題、新疆問題、可以簡略報告、關於黃河水災及棉麥問題、打算稍詳細些說幾句、北平政務委員會委員長黃郛、最近先後到牯嶺南京、據黃委員長的報告、華北戰區、經已接收完竣、此後之努力、則爲華北政治軍事之整理、當依中央已定之方針進行、察哈爾問題、馮委員已接受中央的意旨、離察到泰安、由原任省政府主席宋哲元回任、所有雜軍、正在處理之中、至於新疆問題、政府明令任命劉文龍盛世才之後、地方政務、雖然負責有人、然屬於中央政務者、則尙待處理、新疆位於邊地、外交尤爲重要、黃宣慰使回京報告之後、中央即認爲有選派大員續赴新疆之必要、當時曾擬請考試院戴院長前往、後來戴院長因身體未好、不便遠行、故最後决定由羅部長前往、一切進行、自必依照一向的方針、於此亦不必細</p>
<p>說、如今先說黃河水災、本年七月間、長江上游水漲、政府恐民國二十年水災將重見於今日、成立揚子江防汛委員會、負防汛工作之專責、因爲二十年修堤堅固、防汛委員會又能緊張工作、所以江西安徽雖然有幾處决口、卒經防止、不致成災、誰知長江水患、稍可安心的時候、黃河又告急了、現在蘇北形勢雖已稍緩、山東方面仍極嚴重、政府前此已設立黃河水利委員會、最近並决定暫歸行政院指揮、俾與黃河沿岸各省政府切實聯合救災治河、黃河水利委員會委員長李儀祉尙在病中、現由副委員長王應榆負責、政府原定撥長江防汛委員會六十萬元、財政部已交十萬元、今長江危險期已過、故將所餘之五十萬元、及所剩之麻包、一併撥交黃河水利委員會、爲救災用、並着手於黃河水利之全盤計劃、須知道黃河水利問题、不僅在於救災、而尤在於治河、黃河水利、關於華北各省農工商業至大、救災只是應急之舉、治河纔是永久之圖、華北各省、一旱則赤地千里、一雨則變成澤國、都是河道不治所致、此外還有人爲的原因、如滑縣等處土匪之决堤以防官軍、民團之决堤以禦土匪、皆爲無知之尤、蓋决堤决水、受害者不僅土匪、百姓悉被其災、所以治水技術方面之工作、固然責成黃河水利委員會負責、至沿河之治安、又不能不責成各省政府與各省人民恊力維持、黃河水利不僅是黃河一條河的本身問题、實在是整個黃河流域的問題也、不僅是水災旱災等急切問題、實在是華北農工商業的根本問題、所以黃河水利委員會所負的責任、不僅是救災的治標工作、最重要的、還是治河的根本計劃、其次說到棉麥、兄弟在過去幾次紀念週報告、曾根據海關統計、指</p>
<p>出每年棉麥入口總額價値達三萬萬餘元、此次棉麥借欵、不過由用現欵買進來、變爲由信用賒進來、如此辦法、一來金融上可以使本國經濟易於周轉、二來數量上又不致使國內出產的棉麥有停滯之虞、當然可以說是有利無害、但最近據各地報告、如津浦沿線所有麥產確有停滯產區之情事、其所以不能運銷别處者、并不是因爲没有運輸的車輛、而是因爲市價不好、不能銷售、何以會有這種現象呢、受美麥的影響嗎、不是的、因爲美麥進口、旣如上述、每年均有此數量、則何致今年獨令國內產麥滯銷呢、據詳細調查的結果、纔知道國內產麥所以滯銷、乃由於奸商之操縱、他們以爲政府旣借到大批美麥、便希望能夠以廉價買得、或暫時賒用、於是對於國內產麥、便拒而不銷、同時產棉各地、亦接有相類的報告、政府借棉麥之本意、原所以救濟本國的經濟、如今因奸商之操縱、反而使內地農民將受鉅大之損失、這是應該防止的、如何纔能夠使借來的棉麥用得其當、使奸商不能操縱、而本國的棉麥又不致滯銷呢、這就不能不施行糧食統制了、但於此有一先决問題、政府對於農工商業、施行保護、在軍事政治方面、政府應負全責、不能諉卸於人民、而在經濟方面、則政府不宜獨斷獨行、必須與社會人民互相了解、通力合作、例如軍事上約束軍隊使之不擾民、政治上勵行廉潔使之不害民、人民之生命財產自由、在法津上有切實之保障、而後能安居樂業、這是政府應負全責、不能諉卸於人民的、至於經濟方面、如糧食統制、此與民食及農業商業、以及財政金融、均有密切關係、政府必須深知人民的需要、而且人民的需要、因其地域及其職業之不同、而狀態互殊、甚或利害衝突、政府旣當知其各各之需要、又當爲之一一調劑、歸於相安、方纔能得到糧食統制的妥善辦法、而施行有利、若祇由政府單方面去做、不能周知民隠、則雖有利民之心、反致成害民之政、即如食糧收買及食糧定價、即其一端、政府必須與人民合作、心須與各方面的人民團體合作、斟酌利害、定出辦法、並須由各方面的人民團體監督其辦法之實行、然後可以有利無害、所以糧食統制對於目前使國內產麥不受外麥進口之影響、而致停滯、固然十分重要、而舉辦糧食統制、其根本原則、非政府與人民互信合作不可、有人說、內地交通不便利、社會組織不嚴密、糧食統制、談何容易、統制之活潑進行、有待於交通之發達、這是無可欵義的、然在中國今日惟其交通不便利、社會組織不嚴密、故糧食統制、尤爲必要、須知道凡百事業、都是由需要逼出來的、以中國之大、道路之少、都市對農村發展之日趨畸形、遂使一方面有榖賤傷農之區、一方有粃糠充饑之地、甚至有些地方、米麥堆積、竟要大燒、有些地方、只有樹皮草根、雖欲求粃糠而不可得、此皆需供不均所致、故欲謀救濟、必求調劑、欲求調劑、必先行統制、需供之所以不得均衡、交通不發達、誠爲主因之一、但我們决不能坐待交通發達、以求需供之均衡、我們當因應事實上的需要、促成交通事業之發達、以求糧食統制之活潑進行、中國今日受經濟崩潰之影響者、不僅農民、實則全國工商業者亦皆在繼續破產之中、試檢閱統計數字、則中國經濟破產之慘狀、不望而見、中國出口以絲茶大豆爲大宗、近年以來、絲茶銳减、自東三省失後、大豆一項、亦幾於全失了、入口大部分爲棉貨棉紗米麥麫粉木材、中國本稱以農立國、而農產品尙有頼於外國、其他不必談了、據海關報告、三十年來對外貿易之趨勢有如下表</p>

<p>實民力一句老話、民力充實、而後國力可以振興、充實民力之道、固然要保護農民工人之利益、同時要保護工商業者之利益、如此纔是全民族之利益、固然要統制公的經濟、同時要發達私的經濟、如此纔是整個國家之經濟政策、不是模稜兩可之談、中國之大患、一是無錢、一是有錢而不能善用、這於此次棉麥借欵可以見得最爲明顯、這是我們所應當深切注意的、（二十一日中央社電）</p>

<h3 id="c11">對於羅外長出巡新疆之期望梓 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>自外長羅文斡出巡新疆之命令發表後。一時雖有中央變更外交政策之謠。外長行將易人之說。此在未經事實證明以前吾人均不欲有所論斷羅氏對新聞記者談話。有。「新疆因與外國接壤外交關係亦至複雜願盡視察所得。貢獻中央」之語。汪精衛在就兼署外長職時亦謂羅「此行關係外交關係整個中華民族問題。意義均極重大。」則羅外長此次出巡新疆之外交使命。實足引起國人之注意也。</p>
<p>新疆爲英俄所覬觎。歷時已久。惟蘇俄自五年前完成土西鐵路。其南進之積極。曾引起法德之特别派員調查。我新省之危機。不言可知。英國亦以新疆與彼所控制之阿富汗及印度壤地相接。欲囊括之以完成其獨佔中亞細亞計畫。最近俄人通訊社且傳日本製造滿蒙帝國之企圖。陰謀亦及於新疆收容土耳其廢皇子。擬利用之以煽動我回民此猶就各國單獨之行動言之耳。若更進一步。則蘇俄之欲赤化中亞。與英國及其同志之欲在中亞築成反赤防綫。均足爲我新疆之重大危機。在此種國際形勢之下我遠據新疆之各小軍閥。復不知慕燕之危。一面旣互以兵力自相爭雄一面更各聯强鄰以引狼入室。此次新變以後。陳中在未殺前奉劉盛命赴莫斯科伊黎之張培元亦有親俄之嫌。疏勒之馬紹武則近英馬仲英之逞兵。據俄方所言係受日本指使如此外迫內化欲新疆不爲東北之續。苟非於外交上有適宜之計劃措置。殊無人敢於斷言矣。東北於鐵路網布成。產業漸興以後爲暴日一舉侵佔今新疆能不於航空路通統治較易之日。爲耽耽而視者所宰割乎。是在羅外長此行之能竭其智能。以外應强鄰和緩侵迫之形勢。內諭悍將。使之覺悟危機而戢服也。</p>
<p>東北禍變之爆發。國人對久駐東京之汪榮寳公使。多責其未能消弭大禍於事先及汪之死王君芸生爲文悼之。略略透露其苦心周旋之消息。以證明中央外交當局之不明外勢。徒迷標語口號應尸其咎。羅氏現以外長西行巡視。吾人深望其能高瞻遠曯。妥籌應付西北外患之計劃。不僅此全國八分之一以上之領土。頼以保持矣。</p>

<p>昨鄭兆佳亦勝史密斯　　本星期五中葡决賽扶輪杯上海萬國網球複賽、葡萄牙已以三比二淘汰日本、得决賽、中華先以四比零勝美國、尙餘鄭兆佳對史密斯一組單打、於昨日下午在中華網球塲比賽、結果鄭亦以直落三勝史、此數爲七比五、七比五、六比○、中華乃以五比零全勝美國、本星期五起、中葡兩國舉行决賽、</p>
<p>昨日鄭兆佳與史密斯之比賽、形勢尙見緊張、前兩盤均成七比五、鄭勝未頗覺吃力、惟鄭演習之對角抽球、已有相當把握、有時僅以一二時之差出邊界耳、第一盤鄭先以五比三佔先、後成五比五、以七比五終、第二盤鄭先以四比一勝、後成四比三而五比三、史密斯又追成五比五、鄭再以七比五結果、史密斯始終未能佔前一局或平等比數、第三盤上、鄭之兩角抽擊、得以應手、球每貼近邊線、竣急如矢、史密斯招架不遑、疲於奔命、乃致一籌莫展、鄭以六比零全勝、殊爲容易、</p>

<p>六月三十日（星期五）</p>
<p>今日雖爲無重大事故之一日、但發生一意外變化、如星期三法瓜生擊敗潘萊一般、你斯直落三戰勝塞德、而李氏則曾全勝史篤芬二盤、而又以三比一佔先、此局不啻予駐選手以和理大震驚、但在事實上、有足自慰自解者、蓋史篤芬已竭盡其力、以大進步之球枝、戰勝一疲乏不堪之李氏、天氣殊暖、充滿濕氣、陽光與白雲相交替、但並不似有兩意、觀者仍盛、其不能得入中央場、或第一塲者、則圍擁其他外塲、静聽中央第一兩塲之掌聲、第一塲之閉塲賽、爲馬迪夫人對亨洛丁夫人、此法女子總共僅勝三局、且皆在第一盤中、馬迪夫人略有懈怠、且造成不少不必之錯誤、後如緊工作、毫無姑息、以機器式之球、擊敗亨洛丁、</p>
<p>塞德休斯之戰繼之、塞德勝最初三局、雖抗禦强烈、仍不慌不亂、是後休斯在此次之十三局中、得勝九局、在塞德係不能利用機會、擊法雖毫不鬆弛而樂觀、但此種混合戰法、對付一永不失其自信力且逐漸增加之球員、則不能實用、休斯一無所失、而處處佔先、判斷力甚佳、小心、有勇氣、能乘時上進、大半時間、塞德以近而有力之正手抽球攻之、球着拍如爆炸然、</p>
<p>在第一第二兩盤中、不必詳述、塞德戰略不錯、而方法則誤、由自信而了解、能佔先着、但又不能保持之、一局一盤、常須一記可勝、結果爲休斯所得、一二兩盤、如出一轍、僅第二盤失之較易耳、塞德之眼力、亦大减色、不少時期、常見落下之球、塞德欲擊未擊而失之、失誤可勝機會、較平日太多、常送入網內、或稍出界線寸許、</p>

<p>第三盤起手又錯、但逐漸恢復、以三比一佔先、忽從此一　不振、一局亦不得、球運實亦太差、常有似乎好球之球、結果則反是、休斯有左右敵人之慨、最後數局、勢不可當、塞德陷於絶望、休斯在塲上耐力較塞德爲佳、塞德似在第二盤中、受過熱之病、曾倚椅而息、飲巨量之水、拭以毛巾、復以水濕巾覆於頭部及頸、休斯毫無疲態、隨時準備可續賽、</p>

<p>— 左匀</p>
<p>餓’這個字在字面上是用不着解釋的’不道一般終日飽食的人們’他絶不會瞭解這餓的情態是怎樣凄慘的。</p>
<p>東新橋和大世界一帶’鵠立街頭的「野雞」’伊們爲什麽每天從午後一直立到夜半’而且有時對於行人施出拖綁的手段。伊們爲滿足性慾嗎？這完全是餓在督促着伊們不得不施出卑鄙下賤的方法來滿足肚皮的恐慌而已。</p>
<p>現在好了’法租界警務當局爲維持馬路上的秩序和行人的安寗’一律禁止伊們在外面活動’近來被拘到巡補房襄去的已經很多。這差不多是將伊們手裏的飯碗奪了’一個人不準他去吃飯’這是多麽可慘的事情！</p>
<p>話必須回來’固然野雞在外面拉客’無論在社會方面或個人方面都是有極壞的影響’我們對於取締也是很同情的。不過餓’人人都是一樣。譬如我自已’有時飯燒得遲了’肚皮裏會嘰哩咕嚕地響起來’而且哄鬧個不休’催着要飯吃。</p>
<p>試想’對於吃飯’没有了希望的人’他們的肚皮是怎樣的哄鬧呢？必定是澈烈的不平的’結果是反抗的情緒在這一個不穏定的形勢下產生出來。强的挺而走險’去做一切奸惡的事業。弱的自殺’做乞丐’以至於操皮肉生涯。所以做「野雞」也不是伊們自願的’當然離不掉餓的背景。</p>
<p>旣然社會的罪惡是在餓的環境中造成’那末社會就應該想方法消滅餓的事實。但是’正相反的’社會是在不斷的製造餓的背景；銀行家拚命的將金錢集中’資本家拚命的求謀自足’大商家拚命的壟斷營業：：：：還有不必說了。社會上有許多人藉着地位聲勢剝削他人’莫不是將多數人的糧食’刦奪來培養他自已’所以餓的形成’是目前極普遍的現象。</p>
<p>餓的事實是普遍的形成了’餓的感覺還有許多人不知道’餓和不餓的人隔膜着’自然這餓字永遠在字典上佔着重要的一頁了。</p>
<p>餓之神喲！你在人們的肚皮裏也永遠的佔着割據的局勢吧！</p>

<p>— 林瀅</p>
<p>午倦抛書’一枕黃梁’這正是夏日的生活’可是你在柳蔭深處’仰觀天際’那層層疊疊的白雲’一會兒變幻出不少的花樣。有的像牧童騎牛’有的像壯士舞劍’任你怎麽樣的揣想’都是絶好的天然圖畫’因此覺得古人所說的「夏雲多奇峯」’一點兒不錯。</p>
<p>一般人以爲最難捉摸的是女子的心理’我却以爲最難捉摸的是夏日的天氣。你出門時驕陽蒸射’炙得皮膚發熱；但說不定一霎時間’來上一陣颼颼的凉風’白雲立刻變成鳥雲’豆大的雨點’潑洒起來’呌人猝不及防。若是帶了陽傘套鞋’他偏又不下雨。</p>
<p>現在的時髦女子’多半穿的是薄如蟬翼的這個紗那個紗’雪白的肌膚’隠約可見。新裝的裁製’便是稱合着身體的曲線’簡直和包裹一樣。脚上再穿上搖掏晃晃的高跟鞋兒’萬一遇到急雨’欲躱舞從’結果淋得像出浴的楊妃’讓窮人們大家欣賞這窈窕之美；我眞替伊們有此兒發窘。</p>
<p>不過比夏雲以及夏雨還要變幻的’就是大人先生們的政見。今天是往東’明天會往西’弄昨下屬簡直難於伺候。除非是他們肚裏的蛔蟲’這纔知道他們的心意’否則一動凖保你不遭申斥’也得碰個橡皮釘子。</p>

<p>我說「夜游公子」’有人問是一個姓甚名誰’吾答他這名詞’並不是人的雅號’乃是一個小小的「螢火蟲」’螢火蟲到了夜間’在黑地裏’常常一亮一亮’會閃在吾們眼　中’煞是好看’故螢火蟲一物’雖是很微的蟲類’古人給他的名稱極多，吾眞不暇列舉。就中最饒有趣味的，可算是「夜游公子」四字，覺得尤其確切不移，値得把他來說一說！</p>
<p>這種蟲類。在初生的時候。也似蚊蟲，近於甲蟲，色帶微黃，若照動物學家歸納起來，還要呌它是「鞘翅」一類，不過它的毛端，富貯燐質，所以自然地會發射出一種冷光。好像海面上的夜光蟲一般，這不是在蟲類中放一異采麽？不但這樣，天氣愈熱，他的發光力在深夜中也愈强，小兒女往往在庭院裏納凉的當兒，他偏偏會從牆角簷邊飛逐而下。不一歇，已拍在蒲扇底下，就被裝入一個胡蘆形的玻璃瓶裏，童穉性本好元，當那夜静更深，搴　入睡之際，放在枕邊，你！倘要看書，也可一目十行，十分淸楚，或者掛在帳子的中間，還可算是一盞天成的小電燈，可以一直照到天明，所以「螢火蟲」，是兒童的一種恩物　聽說北美洲，有許多土人們，當那晚間，到森林中去行走，暗黑恐迷途徑，且捕極大的「螢火蟲」，縛在兩足的趾間，步行還好象步月哩！吾國以前隋焬帝，有一天夜游，歷史上載他放出螢火多至數斛，一霎時，光明似同白晝，雖不免言之過甚，吾以爲若有人把它和積聚起來，并深切地去研究它的生活和飼養的方法，非但是極玩意兒的能事，可說其效用，當亦不在細小，與其稱他是「公子」，似没有裨益放人世，不如號他是「明燈」，名副其實得多呢？</p>

<h3 id="c205">關於女人的乳 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 元釗</p>
<p>女人的乳，是最富於肉感和曲綫美的姿態的，尤其那軟綿綿，腻滑滑的感覺，是使人「沉醉」，「神馳」，無怪乎現在一般「不知肉味」的毛頭小夥子要「寤寐求之」的了。</p>
<p>據近代醫學家說：女人的乳，結實有力而高聳者，爲健康之表徵，凡軟弱無力而下埀者，爲孱弱之表徵；吾們貴中國的女人的乳，大都是如後者所說的，這原因當然是爲了「束胸」。</p>
<p>世界上女人的乳，最健康發達的，要算是斯拉夫民族的女人，其次是恩格羅薩克遜人，法國女人的乳最美，富於藝</p>
<p>術趣味的，因爲伊們都用人工的手術，使自已的乳房美化，以炫耀取悅於男子，而吾們中國女人的乳，大半在「病態美」，「有損觀瞻」的二個傳統觀念下，退化没落了。</p>
<p>對於女人的乳，頌贊最烈，爲後世所傳爲美談者，首推法國十八世紀中葉的文學家拉克臬茲氏，他曾寫過很多的關於女人的乳的作品，內中尤以「迷惘了方向」的一篇小說，把女人的乳推頌，禮贊，描寫得淋漓盡致，後人因稱之爲「色情作家」。</p>
<p>前年曾在某英文報上，看到一則關於「女人的乳之竊賊，」大意是說：在利物浦城有一個專在公共塲所偷摸女人的乳之靑年，（已忘姓氏）獲案後在法庭上供彼曾偷摸過一百十四個女人的乳云云。</p>

<p>中國近來出了不少的發明家：如發明木炭代汽油的湯仲明君，曾轟傳一時，博得實業部的贊許，還在南京和湯山間的長途汽車路上作過一次實地試騐，聽說結果很滿人意；鄂人汪日昌君發明防空箭，在漢口南洋烟廠附近營房空地試射，高程達四千米突，空炸三十米突，成績也很好；鎭江江蘇民政廳修械工廠的技士黃芝榮君發明新式手提機關槍一種，能自由運用險門，撥左則快放，撥右可單放，機槍頂上，並可架剌刀，快放如連珠，銳利非凡　，據說·！當局將轉呈中央予以褒奬；汴人范振江君發明兩節式迫擊砲，射程高遠，均可達七千米達，超過高射砲而有餘，他的父親國樑，也曾發明衝鋒鋼板車；此外如同濟大學學生Ｘ君發明私密無綫電，湖南大學學生某君發明無軌列車，據說試騐成績都好，這些發明家，都是一二年內才出現的，在科學程度落後的中國，不能不說是差强人意的事；可是這些發明品，只像曇花一現，不見什麽地方正式使用，神龍見首不見尾，我不禁替發明家扼腕太息！</p>
<p>有人說；中國的發明事業，根本是不會有好結果的，因爲有錢人的子弟，耽於逸樂，絶對不願窮年屹屹地去研究這些勞什子；没有錢的人，雖然對於科學感到興趣，但是，買參考書没錢，購試騐品没錢，更談不上有錢去進學校，縱使有一二個天才的科學家，也因環境關係而不能自由發展他的天才，所以想研究科學的，找不着門徑，已有門徑的，便也中途停止他的研究工作，這話原有相當的理由，但我想這不是絶對的原因吧！</p>
<p>顯微鏡的發明家李芬霍（荷蘭人），起初替人家做　寫的工作；蒸汽船的發明家何爾頓（美國人），窮得只靠母親工作才能度日；火車的發明家斯蒂芬生（英國人），還是一個牧牛郎出身；電燈電影留聲的發明家愛迪生（美國人），十二歲就到加那大的鐵路上，當一個火車裏的小使，也可想見他的窮苦了，足見有科學頭腦的人，並不因爲家庭生活困難而至限制他的天才的發展，那麽，中國近來的發明家，不能把他的研究所得，貢獻於社會，更不能把他的研究工作發揚光大，當然有其特殊的原因，决不是全爲貧困所限，這特殊的原因，不外下列兩種：</p>
<p>㈠政府没有奬勵和輔助㈡國內災禍迭起，不能安心繼續他們研究的工作。</p>
<p>上面兩點，不過是阻礙發明事業的特殊原因之一部份，還不是不能打破的唯一的難關，莫</p>
<p>爾士（美國人）發明了電報機以後，第一次呈報給政府，政府却也睬都不睬他；加力雷奥（意人）發明了望遠鏡之後，雖經尾內旣亞的國王聘請過，但從尾內旣亞回到本國，却遭了敎皇的怒，說他所著的書，違背聖經，還被提到敎會裏去嚴刑拷打，然而他倆的發明品，終究是被世人採用了；若說災禍迭起，便不能安心研究科學，那麽，歐戰前後，怎樣會出飛機大王卡奇司？可見有志研究科學的人，任何阻力，都不能壓制他們，中國的新發明家，缺乏了再接再厲的勇氣，雖然小有發明，但因一時缺少了物質的援助，或是遭受了種打擊，便心灰意冷，終至無聲臭，這大槪就是他們失敗的重要原因吧！</p>

<h3 id="c207">天下太平書 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>日昨林語堂忽發奇想，在本談發表意見：「讓娘兒們幹一下吧」，提出把一切統治權，交給女人管理，他自已决心預備下野，到菲洲去學做野人。這實在是很可讚美的一種意見。</p>
<p>民國十七年初版，由上海泰東書局發行，劉仁航著的一本大書，天下太平書，就是這一方面的巨著。以天下太平名書，是著者以爲照該書辦理，天下可以立致太平之故。他的主張自稱爲世界坤化主義，而其自標在於樹立世界女性政府。　劉仁航書中所言，不外男性尙殺伐，女性近和愛，歷史上的戰爭殺人，都由男性造成，而生育人的都是女性，他問道：「男子有懷胎者否？」以見他的男殺女生爲嶺撲不破之眞理。因此之故，一旦女人執掌大政之後，一定知道人之可愛應愛而不應殺，戰爭便消滅了，天下因之太平。</p>
<p>這樣說來，的確言之有理，等我再加以若干補充，則此理將眞到再不能假，而女政府之應得促其出現，將爲大衆所贊同，世界大同，天下太平，也因之得其端倪了。男女兩性，實在可以稱爲相對立的二大階級，女性是站在被壓迫者的地位的。倘使說現代的問題在資產階級與無產階級的對立，或第四階級對其他階級的爭鬥，那麽將來繼起的一定是男女的對立，女性對男性的爭鬥。現代的工人在工廠受了氣，會回家去向他老婆女兒身上出氣，人力車夫吃了巡捕的虧，也會向他的妻女報仇。因之女性的受壓迫，又是在第四階級之下的，所以在階級爭鬥之後，一定要來那個兩性的爭鬥。第四階級的革命爭鬥，現在還在繼續演進之中，其禍害之烈已足令人痛心疾首，將來還有再演再烈的可能，而女性之受壓迫，其歷史更長，其受苦之程度更利害，所以一旦發生了女性的革命，一定是人世間頂酷烈的悲劇。現在的爭鬥，差不多没有正式的女主角，所以不是人類全體，而是限於人類中之男性，當女性革命發生，便較現在的將有倍加的廣泛，而人類全體都免不出捲入漩渦中去。</p>
<p>爲要避免該項悲劇的產生，只有我們男子堅降旗屈服之一法，像林語堂的預備下野到菲洲，便是頂高明的辦法之一。劉仁航的辦法是先成立起世界女政府來，防患於未然，那是更加聰敏了。我們中國人，凡事頂喜歡根本解决徹底研究，頂講究那久安長治之道，一心一意希望着天下太平世界大同，對於此地所說的一定會感到十二分興味。在學校試行測騐，也有大學生推舉旦角坤伶等做主席或大總統的，可見女性政府如果成立，一定能得多數人的支持。再徵之於現下學校中的校花皇后的權威，便可知女政府之意見，决不是無聊的。胡適之呌我們過五十年後再談抗日，現在我們要從事於培養國力，那麽我們何妨把五千年後應該有的世界女政府先籌備起來呢。這是一舉而使天下太平世界大同的事，比什麽都値得努力，况且我們不是正向這條路上走的嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c208">英語合理化與基本英語 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 索原</p>
<p>基本英語在北方已有過兩篇反對的論文（見北平世界日報），但那是站在國際語的觀點上來批判基本英語的。據我的理解，基本英語徹頭徹尾只是英語內部的改良問題，正如日本之限制漢字一樣，倒並不是像廣告上所說可以做國際語的。在這裏，我想把基本英語作爲英語的合理化方案，來加以批評。</p>
<p>據我想，英語的合理化，至少應該做到以下的兩件事：</p>
<p>第一是綴字法（拚法）的合理化，如母音Ａ，有着各種不同的發音，而拚法都用Ａ。同爲Ｋ音和Ｆ音，却各有Ｃ，Ｋ和Ｆ，ＰＨ兩種拚法。旣有了ＫＳ和ＧＺ，再把多餘的Ｘ列入凑數。此外在Ｒightknow:;等字中之GHK等均不發音。這些都應該按照「一母一音。一音一母」（一個字母只有一個音。一個音只有一個字母來表示）的原則，而加以合理的改造。</p>
<p>第二是文法的簡單化，英語中之不規則動詞（Go-went-gone），名詞多數時之例外（Foot-Feet-qoxes），第三人稱少數現在式動詞之加S：：等等不合理的例外，都應加以合理的簡單化，甚至完全排除。</p>
<p>但是基本英語怎樣呢？有已出各書爲證，對於上述兩點，完完全全承繼了英語的不合理的遺產。基本英語機械地規定人八百五十個字的語彙，作爲它的特點，然而也正好是它的致命傷。雖然原始人類的語彙不過一百多字，現在非洲的土人也只用着三百多字，但是「一個磨光黑色的圓圈，中畫一隻狗在一個喇叭之前」那樣的原始的表現方法，是否適用於現代人呢？那是非常明顯的事。語彙的機械的决定，使基本英語成爲「死的東西」，而把這言語的發展的可能性一把揑殺了。如果首創者並不把基本英語只當作一種英語的敎學法，與英語不可分離的附屬物，而企圖把基本英語作爲獨立的言語，可取英語而代之的合理化的方案，那麽不能不說是完全失敗了。</p>
<p>這個失敗决不是偶然的。英語的合理化這一工作决不會被劍橋大學言語研究所所長奥格登那樣的御用言語學者所完成的。在他，因了他的地位和所屬的社會層，旣没有從發展的觀點來理解言語的可能，自然也没有根本來改造英語的勇氣和力量的。在目下，那種澈底的合理化，會以「褻凟國語的神聖」「破壞國語文法的尊嚴」而受到嚴厲的非難的。在大不列巓的統治者，也只歡迎奥格登那樣的改良主義的欺騙方案，因爲英語的眞正合理化，雖於英國民衆有益，於統治者却是不利的。</p>
<p>然而基本英語的失敗却不足以證明英語合理化之不可能，英語還是有由英國民衆自已的手來澈底合理化的一天的，正和中國日本等文字也會完成眞正的羅馬字化一樣。</p>
<h3 id="c209">論續作 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>譏彈續作爲惡札，爲狗尾續貂；淸初金聖嘆於西廂記於水滸傳最最不客氣，草橋以下指爲關漢卿所續，一代曲家，幾蒙不白之寃：水滸則七十回以下簡直割愛。紅樓夢的續作，自俞平伯判定係高鶚手筆以後，上下截的優劣已有定論，不獨圓夢復夢之爲畫蛇添足也。俞平伯說：「續書没有好的，不是定說續書的人才情必遠遜於前人，乃因才性不同，正如其面，强而相從，反致兩傷。」（紅樓夢辦上卷頁六）豈凡先生說：「續是不容易作的，至少不比新　蹊徑的獨創容易；也有眞正做續集的人，但做</p>
<p>得好的人，仍非常之少。」這都是眞知卓見，說得極不錯的。</p>
<p>然而金聖嘆，俞平伯至豈凡先生，都僅就文學的創作立論；若在我們治史的人看來，「史」幾乎無所謂創作，每種史的作品都是續作。標炳千古的史記，她的前身就是世本；在太史公以後，　先生，劉向，劉　，馮商，楊雄，馮衍，蕭　等一二十家繼修史記。班固，漢書的前身，就是他的父親班彪所作的史記後偉。在班固以後，班昭，馮　又續成其書。范曄後漢書，和前漢書瑜亮並重；其實東漢時已有人着筆，劉珍李尤作紀表名臣節士　林外戚諸傳，蔡邕作朝會車服二志。晋初司馬彪作續漢書，華嶠删定東觀紀爲漢後書。最後范曄編删煩補略，作後漢書。范曄被收時，十志未就，又由劉昭續成之。繼承前人的勝業，擘續補苴來完成大工作，其價値較之創作有郤遜色？</p>
<p>淸初，黃梨洲寫成了明儒學案，想以全力整理宋元七百年間的學術系統，定下綱目來編宋元學案，他畢竟太老了，書未成而身已死去。他把所有工作交給他的兒子　史去做，　史又不曾纂輯成功。全祖望一生以續作宋元學案爲事業，從乾隆十年至十九年，這十年間，無歲不補作宋元學案。祖望死後，學案稿本由門人盧鎬保管，梨洲元孫稚圭借去　鈔，又由全祖望的兒子平黼正誤補缺，寫成别本。直到道光十八年，學案第一次付刻，又由王　軒校補足成百卷。一人之精力有限，一人这壽命有限，一件有價値的作品，决非一手一足所能完成。在版權所有的世界，「續作」原不過是弁利的商品，君策羣力，經半世紀一世紀以完成一種著作，幾乎視同奇蹟。可是眞的爲學術本身着想，爲社君福利着想，雖是「續作」，不是大創作中的重要部分嗎？</p>
<p>因此，我想爲豈凡先生進一解。所謂事業，總是屬於社君的；佛說一切器世間有情世間，皆由衆生業力所造。文藝的創造，從社君變成個人，從街頭關在書房，乃是近世獨有的畸形狀態。自古歌謠的吟咏，故事的傳述，人人都參加創造的工作，幾乎無從知其孰爲創作孰爲續作。水滸一書，只能說是南宋以來千百年間千萬人的共同創作，直到今天，東方書塲的說話人，還在那裏做續作的工夫。從書房解放到街頭，從案頭的創作復爲社羣集體的創作，這時期快要到了，我相信文學之有待於續作，與史篇之有待於續作，並無不同，「版權所有」這抛磚引玉，請豈凡先生再談一談。</p>

<p>阿興把頭微微抬起，偷偷地望着對面正在抽烟的師父：師父歪了半個腦袋，朝着屏門，烟管壅在嘴裏，厚的嘴唇費力的嗡張着，呼𠴂呼𠴂地抽；紙吹在那烟管頭上轉動着，紅的火燄映着師父滿臉的黑鬍鬚，眞有趣。但他不敢多望，怕會給師父學察，忙把頭低下，眼光縮回到握在手裏的一隻袖管上。</p>
<p>機械地，一針一針地縫；針在上下跳動，他的頭也應答着。不久，一隻袖管</p>
<p>縫完了，但掉了另一隻。</p>
<p>師父回過頭來，瞧着他，他正抬起了頭，糟啦！他趕緊把頭低下。</p>
<p>師父鼻孔裏哼了一聲，隨着兩道濃的靑烟　出來，直對他衝。他嗅到了一陣辛辣的烟味，把臉朝着外面。</p>
<p>又是一聲哼，比較以前重，他的心跳　着。把朝外的臉又轉過來，他儘低着頭，耳朶碰着肩。</p>
<p>師父依舊呼呼𠴂呼𠴂的抽。烟衝着他他忍受着這辛辣的烟味，眼注視着手裏不敢動。</p>
<p>阿興怕師父，尤其是師父的「哼」。對於師父的「哼」，阿興再也熟悉不過。兩年來，師父差不多天天要「哼」一次；每次一「哼」，他的心便跳，他害怕，害怕那沉重的据樹尺會落到他的頭上。他意識到那時頭上便會有一塊一塊的像田野裏的荒墳，高高腫起。</p>
<p>想着，想着，阿興更害怕了。他的手抖着，一針一針的遲鈍了。</p>
<p>師父把毒蛇似的眼光射過來，阿興懂得這眼光的意思，他益發怕了；心劇烈的跳，手劇烈的抖。在穿線的當兒，一技針從手裏滑了出來，落在地上。</p>
<p>當他惶恐的灣着腰去拾那針時，沉重的据樹尺已很快的落在他頭上。</p>

<p>一聲低而長的嘆息，窒息地從强壯寬大的肺裡吐出來「幸虧張老爹愛我，把我當做他的兒子：：：：可是：：：今兒：：：就這樣死了，屍身丢在河裡：：：</p>
<p>「别再難過，小方。」阿松想找出兩句安慰的話，但是安慰和希望早已離開他們了。顫抖的嘴唇只好吐着空泛的慰言。</p>
<p>「哼！」那張小臉兒突然充滿了憤怒的血。「這是我的命嗎？張老爹死了，我只好看着他的屍身給人丢在河裡。自已也不犯誰，在碼頭睡覺，還要被人家欺負：：：」「他媽的，」阿松猛地跳起來；「誰欺負你？」</p>
<p>没有回答，只有哽咽的　噎。江面偶爾搖過一兩隻貨船，夜風便傳來了伊牙伊牙的櫓聲。三</p>

<p>隔着江，無數的工廠汽笛狂吼着，電車被朦朧着眼的人架駛着，　鐺地走過，運貨汽車，塌車，垃圾汽車，糞車，在馬路上奔馳。都市的機械重新活動了。</p>
<p>碼頭上的苦力們，在肌肉裡隠藏着未曾恢復的疲勞，零零落落地揉着紅眼睛從地板上爬起來，拖着沉重的脚步，走到馬路的人行道上徘徊。貪婪的眼望着小販攤子上的大餅，黑麵；吝鄙的手數着　褳裡的銅板，或是吊在腰上的竹牌子。</p>
<p>十幾艘陳舊的貨船靠在江邊，艙板已變做灰黑色，船邊的兩根沿木上，蜂窩似地滿佈着竹篙戳的小窟窿。糞車被襤　的老頭兒和赤足蓬頭的娘兒們推着，長蛇陣似地排在岸邊人行道旁。車子一停，立刻掉頭向着糞船，接上長的碗口粗的通心竹子，把車裏的糞輸送到船上去。在接口處，黃綠色的糞汁點點滴滴落在水門汀上。糞車不時地轉換着，水門汀上的糞汁就逐漸增加，終於滙合成爲許多小小的糞池，糞汁在水門汀的隙縫裏縱橫流着，擴張它自已的</p>

<p>— 因</p>
<p>在這失業的呻吟聲響亮地散布於整個的畸形和矛盾的社會裏的現在，大家都具備了「窮」的條件。在我們鄉下，有兩句俗語：「祗怕窮，不怕臭」，這是窮人的一句發牢騒的話：還有「祗怕窮，不怕兇」，這是債權者對他的債務人的一句憐恤而帶有憂傷性的話。</p>
<p>「窮」的確是最可怕的，在這個無錢不可立足的世界，眞没有窮人生存立足的餘地；但在這個奇怪的大世界裏正是裝滿了窮人，所以「窮」，已經是個整個的世界問題。</p>
<p>其實，我以爲在一個人小小的一册日記簿中，若没有進過「窮」的階段，那末，他的生活該是何等的空泛而不充實啊！因爲「窮」不但是没有甚麽恥辱，而且確是一種有剌激的生活，它像一爐熊熊的火，它有燃熾着人的活動與向上的熱情的力。它能夠呌人睜大着眼睛看透這個世界的病癥，以及催促着人們對這一病的世界下一劑「對症下藥」的醫方；並且它能夠呌人用自已的力去創造出許多偉大驚人的事跡來！至於說，有好些人是因爲「窮」而去偷，搶了，甚至於自殺了，那不過只是没有眞正觀點和主張的個人主義者和最没出息的弱者可羞的暴露而已。</p>
<h3 id="c236">東宮覲見紀 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>那一天得權姊的介紹，往遊本埠某校的女生宿舍，即是聞名的東宮。過後頗覺玩得有味，我想因宮禁森嚴，望洋興歎，不得其門而入的人，一定很多，</p>
<p>現在我來寫一些出來，給諸位去夢遊罷。</p>
<p>進了宮門，便遠遠的飄來一陣細碎的音樂，側耳細聽，覺得旣不像琴，又不像笙，及後方知是外國來的凡亞令。宮內粉黛三千，個個活潑輕盈，有的在拍網球，均的三三兩兩，在草地上談天，個個笑靨迎人，如花娟媚！</p>
<p>宿舍內，都是一律的鋼絲牀，整潔</p>
<p>的被褥，尙稱有規律；惟地上果屑凌亂，有的是却克力糖的包皮，有的是瓜子果肉的殻，太不淸潔了。</p>
<p>君羊衆現象程希遠作</p>
<p>差不多每個人的牀邊，都自已弄一些裝飾，有的掛着自已姿態動人的照相；有的貼着中西電影明星的照片：也有自已劃了一張美麗的課程表，貼在旁邊。各人佈置，大家别出心裁，頗見美觀。</p>
<p>在各人的牀下，差不多大家有一雙美麗入時的皮鞋藏着。這種皮鞋，據說僅在星期日穿一穿的。</p>
<p>桌上堆置的除書籍講義之外，還有不少的影戲說明書，這些說明書也有人留成一册，置在桌上。</p>
<p>女學生居多愛好裝飾，個化裝品倒不多見，據權姊說，因學校當局的禁止，各人把化裝品都藏起來了。每月娘姨拿出去的各種化裝品瓶罐，眞是不計其數！</p>
<p>我見有幾個人很認眞的在寫作，我對權姊說，他們倒很用功：權姊笑了一笑說，她們在寫信呢，這裏大都寫信比看講義還要緊。</p>
<p>據說Ｘ女士是這校裏的皇后，權姊說：她交際極廣而能幹，你要去見見她嗎？我說好的。權姊領我去介紹之後，見她果然螓首蛾眉，婉變姣好。Ｘ女士很親暱，和我竟一見如故，彼此通了姓名之後，我便問她：</p>
<p>「女士交際很廣，一方還要求學，足見精力過人。現在有人說專是讀死書，也没有用，必須脚踏實地到社會上去親自體騐和觀察，女士大槪也爲了這缘故吧？」</p>
<p>Ｘ女士微微笑了一笑說：「交際固然一個人不能缺，社會也是一個人所離不開的：但是交際如果過分忙了，也足以有荒學業，所以我現在也有些厭煩交際。」</p>
<p>這眞出於意外的，以交際著稱的Ｘ女士，居然說出這種話來。</p>
<p>「聽人講：女士是這裏頂擅交際的一位，當然對於交際的利害兩面，看得非常透澈。不過，據我看在求學時代，最麻煩而有損害的，要算異性的交際！　Ｘ女士很爽直的說：「不差！我以爲現在有一般的男子是最討厭的，他們是我們前途的障碍，我們女性的魔敵，作爲犧牲品！比如說吧：有人說我是本校的皇后，這完全一般男性玩弄我，而原因還是爲了我交際太繁，他們都認識了我了。」</p>
<p>「照此聽來，女士實在厭恨交際？」</p>
<p>「是的，我實在厭恨交際：並且有些厭惡男性！」</p>
<p>談至此，因時間已不早，權姊照呼了我一同歸去，承這位Ｘ女士還送至門外。</p>

<p>中年甲：可是那也不能那末說。現在的世界，見錢不要的人固然没有，而且現在的軍隊，幾個月不關餉，那末總是要吃飯的，怎麽敎他们不自已動手呢？</p>
<p>老年：不過無論怎麽說，要老百姓破鈔總是不對的不關餉，可以問官長要呀，爲什麽要在我們身上打主意呢？</p>
<p>中年丙：可不是，去年縣城裏的軍隊閙餉，可不就打死了好幾個官長</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>（汽車聲動地而來。）</p>
<p>中年乙：聽！什麽響？</p>
<p>老婦：哎呀！不好，又是天殺的飛機來了。</p>
<p>老年：眞的嗎？那末我們趕快逃呀！</p>
<p>中年乙：不，這不是飛機。</p>
<p>老年：在那兒響呀？我怎麽一點也没有聽見呢？哎！人老人，眞是不中用，有時候連打雷也聽不見的。</p>
<p>中年丙：（站在台右的樹堆上）是汽車。：：你瞧那麈土。：有兩部汽車，不知道是裝些什麽？</p>
<p>（汽車聲由遠而近，大家都好奇的跑到台的左方去。祗有老年和中年甲還立在原地向左方望去。接上聽見汽車的喇叭聲，就在台左方停下了，但觀衆不能看見。於是人聲嘈雜。只聽得有人在說：）</p>
<p>聲：好，就在這裏停一會兒罷。聲：哎喲！哎喲！：痛死我了。小孩：（自人叢中擠出）呀！多怕人呀！是全死屍，駭死我啦。死屍上面躺滿了傷兵，血淋淋的一塌胡塗。可怕極了。</p>
<p>中年甲：有多少？</p>
<p>聲：不是兩車子滿滿的嗎？誰知道有多少。</p>
<p>（一個偑有紅十字臂張的下級軍官登塲，前後左右看了一下。又下塲）</p>

<p>中年甲：這幾天前線打得確是利害，差不多天天是運傷兵，運死屍。老婦：天啦！這到底是怎麽一回事呢活人們坐在死屍上喊痛，就是不痛死也就怕死了。</p>
<p>老者：那又有什麽辦法呢？傷了這麽多，死的也這麽多。</p>
<p>中年丙：眞是要命，那些死屍全臭了。</p>

<p>老婦：可是敎他們就睡在地下嗎？可憐稻草也没有一點兒的。（兩個看護兵用硬板抬，兩個傷兵上。當傷兵被放在地下的時候，發出慘痛的呼喊。中年丙也扶着輕傷的上來。讓她坐在老的身邊。人們都以同情的目光注視着傷兵，并且察視他們的傷口。）老者：（向在其身旁說）老總，你打傷了那裏呀？傷兵甲：傷了腿，恐怖骨頭已經斷了，</p>
<p>看護兵：（又抬了好些人上來）骨頭斷了嗎？骨頭斷了你還走得路？吹什麽牛皮呀？傷兵乙：我的媽呀！哎喲！我的媽呀·水那一位做好事的給一點兒水我喝好嗎？：；媽媽！痛死我啦！</p>
<p>軍醫：吵什麽呀？傷兵乙：媽媽！我看不着你了，我要列啦。：：哎喲！</p>

<h3 id="c241">關於ＨinPIeWeKes的劇本（下） <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 伯符</p>
<p>電影譯名「自立之道」</p>
<p>無疑地，作者在這個女兒的性格裏，替我們描寫出一個有毅力，有頭腦，能自主的現代女性，打破了性的因襲關念，打破了傳統的道德思想，這正是易卜生所描寫的女性的自然發展。不過在二十年前，英蘭北國一寒村的工女，是否有這種頭腦，實屬一疑問，這一點，不能不說作者也和易卜生一樣，羅曼主義的色彩太過重了。</p>
<p>可是，這篇劇作，在二十年後的今日，使我們還有重讀的價値。這個，並不因爲作者替我們寫出一個羅曼諦克的新女性。乃在作者的性格描寫替我們畫出了一個典型的資本家和其他一些人的性格。</p>
<p>女兒爭鬥的對象，自然是傳統的觀念，和因襲的道德，而代表這個伊地渥洛基的人，即是那位大少爺的父親，！一個工廠主人。他本和女兒的父親同以工人起身，但是十數年後，他已成了百萬富翁，而女兒的父親依然還是一個工人，並且不能不在他的工廠裏作工。劇中這兩個老人性格的對照，實在描寫得好。一個管得兒子俯首帖耳。一個女兒也管不住，還要受老婆的氣。這兩者間性格的不同，便决定了他們在那種社會的運命。至於資本家特有的個人主義，更在這位工廠主人的性格上，活費出來。他對他的妻子說，他所以拚命賺錢的原故，並不是因爲錢可以買得到富裕的生活，乃是因爲金錢即是勢力。所以他替兒子買汽車。並非呌他闊氣，乃是使人家說他兒子坐得起汽車。又說他兒子要化用多少都行，但是得開口向他索取。尤其是到了他知道他的兒子這個事之後，他取的態度，更是表現出他的爲人來。在這一點，和他性格相對照的，便是他兒子的未來丈人。他也是一個資本家，可是乃是一個極端的自利主義者，即中國電影上，常見的那種爲富不仁的人。可是兒子的父親，除開想當一個有錢人之外，還有野心，他還要一手支持起他們所造成的這個社會。所以凡危害及這個社會的道德律，他都不惜拚命的爭鬥。這種人便是成立資本主義社會的中堅分子。作者本來也是蘭加洲人，具有實際經騐，所以他在描寫這種人的時候，非常成功。</p>
<p>這篇劇的一大半力量，全在對話上，可是劇中人所說的話，都帶有土音。我們看劇本時，已覺費力，若演成電影，恐怕更不甚了了。可是若知道這劇的來源倒很可値一看。（完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＳhotgunPess</p>
<p>的確不是過分的話，哥倫比亞公司的出品，常是敎人失望的。這自然是製片者太重視了低級興趣的原因。正因爲如此，他們從那些很少有機會看電影；同時智識水準較爲低下的大衆身上掏去不少的金錢了。從這一方面說，這一公司的企業家，也許是很得意的吧。但是就電影藝術本身而論，無論站在任何立傷上來說，對於每一出品决不應當粗製濫造。即就迎合低級興趣而言，亦應當盡量的充實內容，而同時在形式上，却力求純樸。一方面固然要使他們看得懂，但另一方面也要使觀衆受着良好的敎育。因此，我們不能誌庸俗淺薄的便是趣者，也不一定能夠使他們全可看懂。茲以本片爲例，坐在我後面的兩位上海人，他們大槪是對於這單槍匹馬之類的東西很感覺興味的。當看到丁麥蓋在鄉村酒店中大打出手的時候，只聽得一位說：「格個片子嘸啥！」其後丁麥蓋在山中的石上：發現了一團泥塊，上面印有皮帶鈕扣和子彈的痕迹，因而知道他的仇人曾伏在這石上行兇，於是將這泥塊拿去作爲證物。但是在這個地方，後面的兩位朋友便看不懂了，原來說話的那位便幾次的問：「爲啥？爲啥？」答話的也祗能說：「吾也勿懂呀。」於是可知，這種影片對於他們仍有不少隔閡了。至於說到內容，那末這種武狹，不消說不會給與他們良好的印象。丁麥蓋所飾的那個角色，爲殺父之仇，爲了馬羣被刧，爲了是自已的惡人，於是大顯出奸漢的威風，懲暴除奸，大打出手。那種「七劍十三狹」上的英雄，固然令人發笑，同時，無組織，無紀律的混亂狀態，更是給與他們惡劣的敎訓。因此　我想這樣的影片，假使還是「看了一套又一套」的開映下去，多少」血氣的「「低級」</p>
<p>朋友，定會跑到大山中去做刧富濟貧的綠林豪傑了。</p>
<p>然而話又說回來了，在目前電影這東西，還被企業家作爲最好的生產工具的時候，到底不能如我們所願而成爲敎育大衆的利器。因此便决定了從事文化的人們，在目前有着比批判影片更重大的任務。</p>
<p>至於說到這一影片的技術方面，那末我以爲只是好些馬在銀幕上跑來跑去，可以說什麽技巧也談不上的。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c243">「生機」短評 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 景純</p>
<p>在這貼切的主題下，展開了一個生動的故事。劇中的主角李偑蘭要是以中國的經濟機構來分析，她正是一個市民的主婦。她一家生活的來源，全在丈夫機智的金融交易手腕上面。以我們直感的觀察，不消說這種女性是十足的幫閒者；除現成的享樂外，一身是懶筋。這種普遍的婦女没落的現象，就是中國婦女的嚴重問題。不過我們不該因此對女性前途悲觀。幾年來，不是一般社會科學家有熱烈的指示？但是理論是理論，没有具體的形象的剌激，婦女運動仍是在蠕動狀態中。</p>
<p>現在，我們急切的需要着，文化的各部門，能關於這個問題有發揮的機會，我看了「生機」，覺得對這暗慘的婦女問題，已經有了明快的解答，他從成千成萬摸索於黑暗中的婦女，揀出一個典型女性的「李偑蘭」來；這個女性並非超人，是把握實現的人物。</p>
<p>我們看她，有解脫險惡環境的决心，有堅定不移的意志。艱苦地，玫隻柔弱的手幹出大事業來創辦縫衣廠，目的是救濟没職業的婦女，不是爲想榨取工人的汗血，實現她們的「自求生存」</p>
<p>的意義。這麽看來，我們可以說，李偑蘭是個有社會思想的新女性。</p>
<p>當然的，這次「生機」的演出，對於中國婦女運動，有一種很大的推動力。（缺章却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c244">觀「生機」後之我見 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 林修梅</p>
<p>邵醉翁過去導演的影片，除了「芸蘭姑娘」</p>
<p>之外，很少驚人的供獻。現在我看了「生機」之後，覺得邵醉翁是比較以前進步了。</p>
<p>「生機」　導演的技術，有了新的收穫，而運用對照，也很巧妙，廣告上說，是邵醉翁轉變作風的傑作，雖然，「傑作」兩字未免誇大，但「轉變作風」却是實在的。</p>
<p>我們單就從這「生機」片名上看來，是多麽充滿着生氣勃勃的樣子。故事的進展，自首至尾，告訴一班婦女們，要怎樣的自立，怎樣的奮鬥且不查依賴男子，不要做男子玩物，刻苦努力的工作，將來自有成功的希望。像李偑蘭就是一個榜樣。同時，　對於現代社會的黑暗，人情的勢利，也有深刻的描寫。</p>
<p>但該片也有不少缺點，如李偑蘭用烟缸擲中流氓，流氓就應聲倒地，躺着不動，在情理上不會這樣，吳達卿破產後，往尋李偑蘭時，路上所貼標語似專對吳而發，且馬路上除吳一人行走外，并無其他行人，這也不大合理。又吳達卿的客廳，似乎太宏壯偉大，因爲達卿不過是小資產階級，不會住這樣的大厦。</p>
<p>攝影收音方面，成績平平。光線有幾處嫌太軟，但不足爲病。該片與聯華的「母性之光」</p>
<p>同樣是國產片的成功之作。（缺章却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c245">看了「生機」 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 俞堅</p>
<p>（上略）故事的編成，不能否認是覓得了新鮮的題材然而，總覺得還有許多地方不夠。在想也許是編劇者要故意這麽的，因爲不這麽編便不會得到那麽樣的一個收塲。其餘的不夠的地方，聰明</p>
<p>的編者也未嘗不知道，只是因了種種的限制，他不得不「就這樣吧。」</p>
<p>收音很淸晣，這，給這片子增光不少。不過，歌似乎嫌多了一點。</p>
<p>不知道是受了故事的限制呢，或者是其他，總覺得各個演員的演出都是平平的，雖也並不感到誰演得「太不稱」。這片中，陳玉梅可算是賣力的了，但，也不覺得若何精彩。</p>
<p>景却配得很好。攝影還不錯，有幾個巧妙的鏡頭實在是値得嘆服的。</p>
<p>這有一點，就是有些地方覺得不很聯貫，固然，錯綜的穿插是不可少的。可是弄到了不聯貫，却是不好的現象。雖然這片子給我的印象并不深，但，這片子已有了好的傾向，這一點我可並不否認。這一點使我躺在牀上的時候，感到了相當的高興（缺章却酬）</p>

<p>— 黛黛</p>
<p>生機的成績，較以前天一出品似有進步，發音亦頗淸晰。茲特述評如下：</p>
<p>主角陳玉梅，飾一在惡環境中奮鬥的女性李偑蘭，起初表演受壓迫情狀，及聽見其夫吳達卿夢中囈語，「蹙眉沉思」，「疑　橫生」數幕極合身份。其後憤夫無良，携子大歸劇情轉成緊張。陳玉梅自此幕起，表演方法，亦急轉直下，變成絶端的剛毅勇敢。自始至終，精彩有力。就全盤說，陳玉梅在「生機」裏的成績是最成功的一個。</p>
<p>配角方面，袁美雲的李偑蘭的妹妹做得狠不錯，可惜表演機會極少。但唱了二支一蠂和蜂和「小寳寳，」也還曼妙動聽。張振鐸的吳達卿，在前半部表演一般小資產階級的荒謬行爲，有處動作，似太輕浮。後半部表演「破產」後的失意苦痛，及被李偑蘭收留後的克苦誠摯，尙佳。陸　霞飾演吳達卿的姘婦老三，表演頗努力，但嫌過火，其他如王慧娟，葉秋心，馬東武，朱天紅等在此片分飾角色均稱職，大體說來，尙無大疵，導演有小聰明，對照極佳，攝影平平。</p>

<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>她對薛立丹道「請你放心好了.我必定做得使你們稱心滿意.」她又用很柔和的聲音，問薛爲什麽要待她這樣好。薛立丹說將來有一天總會告訴她的，但是現在還没有到讓她明白的時候，他們四目相交，默然無言。伊緊微笑着。薛立丹一往情深地看了她一回，就鞠着躬退出去了。</p>
<p>戲開幕了，伊　露蘭絲登臺表演了。薛立丹站在幕後，揑着一把汗，氣都不敢吐的看着。眼淚充滿了他的眼眶，喉中格格不知是何滋味。直等到幕落，場中掌聲如雷。幕又啟了，伊　鞠着躬領受全塲的敬禮，如是者往返數次，一直到掌聲漸漸地息了下去。他然後擠到後　，那裡已經站滿了慶賀和瞻仰的人羣。他最後近了她的身，拉了她的手，一言不發的注視着她。然後又低頭吻着她的額說道：「伊　不勝羞慚地問道：「你眞喜歡我嗎？」薛立丹說：「你的表演太高妙了。」伊　又問他意士頓覺得怎樣。薛立丹告訴她意士頓因爲她的表演出乎意外，高興得如同發瘋似的。他一回兒就要來談判合同了。戲評家勞倫斯亦來賀她。他說他已經打電許給他的報館裡，預備許多好應用的形容詞。勞倫斯走了，伊　和薛立丹都驚喜萬分，因爲勞倫斯係百老匯著名的辣嘴，向來不大說人家好話的。於是意士頓也來了。他拿着她的手說道：「我親愛的，我眞無話可說了。你是一個奇蹟。我在戲院這許多年，這是我最快活的一夜。」意士頓說完了又埋怨他自已，說他以前從來没有給她一個機會。眞是對不住她，使他慚愧到萬分。伊　反而安慰着他，呌他不要講那些過去的話了。意士頓心又漸漸地覺得心安些。他告訴她說從此之後，她就在他事業卵翼之下了。他還添了一句：「這完全是生意經。」伊　跟着他說了一聲「完全是生意經，」心裡很難過，難道心中的舊創永遠不會復元了嗎？門又響了，海傑斯伸進頭來問道：「我可以進來嗎？」伊　當時亦說不出什麽話來，僅僅對他點着頭。海傑斯進來了，伊　對着他們三個人道：「你們三個人是使我成名的恩人，以後我亦將報答你們，使你們不致因我而失望了。」海傑斯對她深切地注視着，然後很誠懇地說道：「你這個話應當慢些說。」然後他就講出一番道理來。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">From Chengwu to Jining, the Plain is Several Feet Deep in Water <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Breached river water overflows in three streams. Heze and Cao County become a vast expanse of water. Shou Zhang and Yang Gu become a land of swamps. Jiaxiang and Juye are also impacted. Fan County is particularly widely submerged. Shandong Provincial Government holds a disaster relief meeting and decides to allocate funds for relief. Xuzhou Dike Defense Committee rushes to repair the encircling city dike. (Jinan) The breached river water from the south bank of the Yellow River has reached Jining. From Chengwu to Jining, the flatlands are three to four feet deep, navigable by boat. Four-fifths of Heze is flooded, and seven-tenths of Cao County. In Cao County, the water enters in two streams: one through the old course of the Yellow River, over twenty feet deep, submerging the southern part of ninety districts; the other through the overflowing Sha River and Baihua River, flooding dozens of miles, with water deep to the thighs, submerging all of the second, third, fourth, and fifth districts, and the northern part of the first district. A vast expanse of water has submerged over eight hundred villages. Fields, crops, and houses have all been swept away. The county initially suffered from drought and now suffers from floods. The Luxi Counties Flood Disaster Relief Association has decided to telegraph Lin, Jiang, Wang, and Chen (Mingshu) for relief and to telegraph newspaper offices across the country, asking them to appeal for help. The flooded area of Fan County is about thirty li long and fifty li wide, affecting more than 340 villages and less than 3,000 qing of crops. The water level above Fan County on the Yellow River has slightly receded. The water level from Fan County to Shou Zhang is stable, and the water level below Shou Zhang continues to rise. The water level at Luokou has risen by 2.3 inches to 30.8 meters. The newly built sub-dike on the Jin Dike in the three counties of Fan is submerged by seven or eight inches to one foot, but the work is becoming more stable. Today, Han convened a meeting on disaster relief in the provincial government, and all members of the provincial committee and the chief secretary of the provincial government attended. It was decided to: 1. Allocate 100,000 yuan for emergency relief. Relief workers have already departed, 15,000 yuan to the north bank and 10,000 yuan to the south bank, with the remainder to follow. In the future, they will save money from other expenses and save 2 million yuan for relief. 2. Request the central government to allocate huge funds to repair the river works in Hebei and Henan to prevent breaches in Hebei and Henan, which would cause disaster in Shandong. If absolutely necessary, they will build a dike from Heze, coordinated to Cao County, to prevent floodwaters from Hebei and Henan from flowing east. Heze and Cao County are 200 li apart. 3. Send the Director of the Construction Department and the Director of the River Bureau to attend the six-province flood control meeting in Nanjing. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu telegraphed Wang, Su Gu, and Yu Liu, advocating that a Yellow River Downstream Management Committee be formed by Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Hebei, with a centrally appointed senior official as chairman, and each province along the river sending a commissioner to reside in the committee to proceed as circumstances dictate. He also telegraphed Lin Jiang Wang internally, saying that the disaster area in western Shandong is expanding. A telegram from Juye said that at one o'clock in the morning on the 17th, Yellow River water entered the county from Liu Changtan, and by noon it reached Bu Mountain, west of the county seat, with a width of six or seven li. A telegram from Yuncheng said that the water from Erfenzhuang in Dongming County is spreading northeast toward Heze and has reached Yanshiko, only three or four li from Liucun in Juancheng, with a great surge. A telegram from Sun Zerang, the county magistrate of Heze, said that Yellow River water surrounds the city on all sides, a vast expanse of water, dozens of li wide on the northwest and northeast sides, flowing east to Xinjie, five or six feet deep. Villages have collapsed, and people are living outdoors. Refugees are gathering inside the city, and food is scarce. The northwest and northeast are particularly devastated. There are no boats to escape the flood, and many people have died. Between the Mian Dike in Shou Zhang and the fifth and sixth districts of Yanggu, it has become a land of swamps. The water has reached Zhangqiu Town in the east and continues to flood east to the south. Disaster victims are weeping and begging for the quick allocation of huge funds for relief, imploring that consideration be given to the hunger and drowning of millions of lives, and to quickly raise huge funds for emergency relief to save lives, with the utmost earnestness. The Central Government has sent Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, to fly to Jinan to negotiate relief. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The county magistrate of Shan County telegraphed that the breach at Lanfeng, the water entered Jiangsu province via Shan County and the water condition is stable. Water from the breaches at Dongming and Kaocheng flowed through Heze and Chengwu to Fanggui Village, 25 li north of Shan County, where the water level has stabilized. An investigation by disaster relief officer Zhao Yunxie, via telegraph to the provincial government, stated that in the Shou Zhang area, disaster victims are living on the dikes. Newly built enclosures in Feicheng are showing leaks, with water seeping through the top of the dike at five inches, a dangerous situation. They are currently rushing to protect the dike. The middle and lower reaches continue to rise today. The water level at Luokou is 30.75 meters. However, the water has receded in Fan County, and the situation on the Jin Dike has eased.

<p>Song First Telegraphed Fang Ji and Others to Come to Zhangjiakou to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan left Beiping this morning with Qin Dechun, Pang Bingxun, Xiong Bin, and others on a special train. All personnel from the various departments of the 29th Army also traveled with him, along with a platoon of guards. Pang plans to get off the train at Xuanhua, while Song and others will go directly to Zhangjiakou. Song carried part of the supply funds for the various units with him this morning, preparing to distribute them separately after arriving in Zhangjiakou and awaiting reorganization. Regarding the reorganization of the miscellaneous troops, it is heard that a rough decision has been made, preparing to reorganize three divisions and three independent brigades, numbering approximately 25 regiments. Zhang Renjie and others are hoping to be divisional commanders. Whether the reorganization will be based on this number has not yet been determined. It will depend on the actual count after Song and others arrive in Chahar and check the equipment, with the best firearms being the standard. Jiang Bocheng and Hou Ying will remain in Beiping for two or three more days before going to assist Song in handling everything. Pang's bandit suppression headquarters will be temporarily located in Xuanhua, but Song still requested that he station his troops in Zhangjiakou. Part of Pang's troops may be transferred to Zhangjiakou. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that he has received 100,000 yuan for the reorganization of the miscellaneous troops. The supplies for his own army will be sent by the Military Sub-Committee in two or three days. After arriving in Zhangjiakou, he will invite the various generals to discuss all measures. The generals and he are all old friends from the Northwest Army, and after meeting, everything will be easily resolved. Because Chahar's affairs are complicated, he specifically invited Xiong to go and assist him in handling everything. Xiong Bin said that because the affairs of Chahar have come to an end, he had originally planned to return to Nanjing immediately, but Song earnestly persuaded him, so he went to Chahar to help handle everything. He will return to Beiping in two or three days, at which time Jiang Bocheng will go to Zhangjiakou. (21st)</p>

Whether the bandit suppression headquarters in Chahar Province will be moved to Zhangjiakou in the future has not yet been determined. After the initial resolution of the Chahar situation, other minor matters will be easily discussed. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

He will be in Chahar on the 21st to welcome them, hoping they will arrive soon. A few days ago, Ji telegraphed Song from near Zhangbei, still using the excuse that he was unwilling to leave the army.

<p>Wang Jingwei Reports on the Yellow River Disaster and Cotton and Wheat Loan Cases; Chen Lifu Speaks on the Poverty and Supplementation of Living Materials (Nanjing) The Central Government held its 93rd commemorative week at 8:00 AM on the 21st. Present were Central Committee members Chen Lifu, Ye Chucang, Gu Zhenggang, Xiao Zhongzhen, Li Ciwen, Hong Ludong, and staff members, totaling 600 people. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. Chen Lifu gave a report titled "The Poverty and Supplementation of Living Materials," the gist of which was that during his recent visit to Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, he witnessed extremely impoverished social conditions in various places. This was entirely due to the lack of living materials, insufficient productive forces, and uneven distribution methods, leading to the collapse of the social and economic organization. This also meant that the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood had not been realized, for which all comrades should take responsibility. Intellectuals across the country should contribute their intellect to assist the people in rural areas, develop agriculture and industry, increase social productive forces, and should no longer concentrate in cities to become consumers. In particular, comrades of our party should follow the Premier's teachings, awaken the inherent spirit of the nation, satisfy the people's spiritual and material desires, and establish the people's self-confidence, organizational power, and productivity, so that the social foundation can be consolidated and the country can be revitalized. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a commemorative week at 9:00 AM on the 21st. Present were Wang Zhaoming, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Yongbin, Lin Xiang, Chen Shaokuan, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, Peng Xuepei, Zeng Zhongming, and National Government staff members, totaling more than 500 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. President Wang reported on the events of the past week. Regarding political matters, such as the takeover of the North China war zone, the Chahar issue, and the Xinjiang issue, he could give a brief report. Regarding the Yellow River flood and the cotton and wheat issues, he intended to say a few words in more detail. Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, recently visited Guling and Nanjing. According to Chairman Huang's report, the takeover of the North China war zone has been completed. Future efforts will focus on the reorganization of North China's politics and military affairs, which will proceed according to the central government's established guidelines. Regarding the Chahar issue, Commissioner Feng has accepted the central government's instructions, left Chahar for Tai'an, and Song Zheyuan, the former chairman of the provincial government, has returned to his post. All miscellaneous troops are being dealt with. As for the Xinjiang issue, after the government officially appointed Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai, local political affairs, although someone is in charge, those belonging to the central government's political affairs still need to be dealt with. Xinjiang is located on the border, and diplomacy is particularly important. After Envoy Huang's return to Beijing to report, the central government immediately recognized the necessity of selecting a senior official to continue to Xinjiang. At that time, it was planned to invite President Dai of the Examination Yuan to go, but later President Dai was unable to travel far due to poor health, so it was finally decided that Minister Luo would go. All progress will certainly follow the consistent guidelines, so there is no need to elaborate here.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the Yellow River flood. In July this year, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River rose, and the government, fearing that the floods of 1931 would be repeated today, established the Yangtze River Flood Prevention Committee to take full responsibility for flood prevention work. Because the dikes were reinforced in 1931 and the Flood Prevention Committee was able to work intensively, although there were some breaches in Jiangxi and Anhui, they were eventually prevented from becoming disasters. Who knew that when the Yangtze River flood situation was somewhat relieved, the Yellow River was in trouble again. Although the situation in northern Jiangsu has eased slightly, the situation in Shandong is still very serious. The government had previously established the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, and recently decided to temporarily place it under the command of the Executive Yuan, so that it could effectively cooperate with the provincial governments along the Yellow River to carry out disaster relief and river management. Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, is still ill, and is currently being taken over by Vice Chairman Wang Yingyu. The government originally planned to allocate 600,000 yuan from the Yangtze River Flood Prevention Committee, and the Ministry of Finance had already handed over 100,000 yuan. Now that the Yangtze River's danger period has passed, the remaining 500,000 yuan and the remaining burlap bags will be transferred to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee for disaster relief, and to begin work on the overall plan for Yellow River water conservancy. It must be understood that the Yellow River water conservancy issue is not only about disaster relief, but also about river management. Yellow River water conservancy is of great importance to agriculture, industry, and commerce in the provinces of North China. Disaster relief is only an emergency measure, and river management is a permanent solution. In the provinces of North China, a drought turns the land into a barren desert, and a rain turns it into a swamp, all caused by the mismanagement of the river channels. In addition, there are man-made reasons, such as bandits in places like Hua County breaching dikes to prevent government troops, and militias breaching dikes to defend against bandits, all of which are extremely ignorant. Breaching dikes and flooding harms not only bandits, but all the people suffer. Therefore, the technical work of water management is certainly the responsibility of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, but the security along the river must also be maintained by the provincial governments and the people of each province. Yellow River water conservancy is not only a problem of the Yellow River itself, but is in fact a problem of the entire Yellow River basin. It is not only an urgent problem of floods and droughts, but is in fact a fundamental problem of agriculture, industry, and commerce in North China. Therefore, the responsibility of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee is not only to carry out disaster relief, but most importantly, to make a fundamental plan for river management. Next, let's talk about cotton and wheat. In my previous commemorative week reports, I have cited customs statistics, pointing out</p>
<p>that the total value of annual cotton and wheat imports reaches more than 300 million yuan. This cotton and wheat loan is simply changing from buying with cash to buying on credit. In this way, firstly, in terms of finance, it can make the national economy easier to circulate, and secondly, in terms of quantity, it will not cause domestic cotton and wheat production to stagnate. It can certainly be said that it is beneficial and harmless. However, according to recent reports from various places, there is indeed a situation of stagnant wheat production along the Jinpu Railway. The reason why it cannot be transported and sold elsewhere is not because there is no transportation vehicle, but because the market price is not good and it cannot be sold. Why is this happening? Is it affected by American wheat? No, because American wheat imports are as mentioned above, and there is this quantity every year, so why does it uniquely cause domestic wheat production to stagnate this year? According to detailed investigations, it was found that the reason why domestic wheat production is stagnant is due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants. They believe that since the government has borrowed a large amount of American wheat, they hope to be able to buy it at a low price or temporarily borrow it on credit. Therefore, they refuse to sell domestic wheat. At the same time, similar reports have been received from various cotton-producing areas. The government's original intention in borrowing cotton and wheat was to help the national economy, but now, due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, farmers in the interior will suffer huge losses. This should be prevented. How can the borrowed cotton and wheat be used properly, so that unscrupulous merchants cannot manipulate it, and domestic cotton and wheat will not stagnate? This requires the implementation of food control. However, there is a prerequisite for this. The government protects agriculture, industry, and commerce. In military and political affairs, the government should take full responsibility and cannot shirk it to the people. In economic affairs, the government should not act arbitrarily, but must understand and cooperate with the people. For example, in military affairs, the army should be restrained from disturbing the people, and in political affairs, integrity should be promoted to prevent harm to the people. The people's freedom of life and property should be effectively guaranteed by law, and then they can live and work in peace. This is the full responsibility that the government should bear and cannot shirk to the people. As for economic aspects, such as food control, this is closely related to the people's food, agriculture, commerce, finance, and finance. The government must know the needs of the people, and the needs of the people vary according to their region and occupation, and even conflict. The government must know each of their needs and adjust them one by one to achieve harmony, so that a proper method of food control can be obtained and implemented beneficially. If only the government does it unilaterally and cannot know the people's hidden feelings, then even with the intention of benefiting the people, it will turn into a policy of harming the people, such as the purchase of food and the setting of food prices, which is one aspect. The government must cooperate with the people, and must cooperate with people's organizations in various aspects, consider the advantages and disadvantages, and formulate methods, and the implementation of the methods must be supervised by people's organizations in various aspects, so that it can be beneficial and harmless. Therefore, food control is very important for preventing domestic wheat from being affected by the import of foreign wheat and stagnating, but the fundamental principle of organizing food control is that the government and the people must trust and cooperate with each other. Some people say that inland transportation is inconvenient and social organizations are not strict, so how easy is it to talk about food control? The active progress of control depends on the development of transportation, which is undoubtedly true. However, in China today, precisely because transportation is inconvenient and social organizations are not strict, food control is even more necessary. It must be understood that all undertakings are forced out by needs. With the size of China, the lack of roads, and the increasingly distorted development of cities to rural areas, on the one hand, there are areas where grain is cheap and hurts farmers, and on the other hand, there are places where chaff is used to fill the stomach. Some places even have rice and wheat piled up and burned, while some places only have tree bark and grass roots, and even want to find chaff but cannot get it. This is all caused by uneven supply and demand. Therefore, to seek relief, we must seek adjustment, and to seek adjustment, we must first control. The reason why supply and demand cannot be balanced, the lack of transportation is indeed one of the main reasons. However, we must not sit and wait for the development of transportation to seek the balance of supply and demand. We should promote the development of transportation in response to actual needs to seek the active progress of food control. In China today, those affected by the economic collapse are not only farmers, but in fact, industrialists and businessmen across the country are also continuing to go bankrupt. A review of statistical figures will reveal the tragic state of China's economic bankruptcy. China's exports are mainly silk, tea, and soybeans. In recent years, silk and tea have declined sharply. Since the loss of the three northeastern provinces, soybeans have also been almost completely lost. Most of the imports are cotton goods, cotton yarn, rice, wheat, flour, and timber. China has always been called an agricultural country, but agricultural products still rely on foreign countries. There is no need to talk about other things. According to customs reports, the trend of foreign trade in the past 30 years is as follows:</p>
<p>Comparative Table of Imports and Exports (Unit: Millions of Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Year Imports Exports Trade Deficit</p>
<p>10 Years Before the Republic 315 214 101</p>
<p>5 Years Before the Republic 416 264 152</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 1 473 370 103</p>
<p>Year 6 549 462 87</p>
<p>Year 11 945 654 291</p>
<p>Year 16 1,012 918 94</p>
<p>Year 17 1,195 991 204</p>
<p>Year 18 1,265 1,015 250</p>
<p>Year 19 1,309 894 414</p>
<p>Year 20 1,433 909 524</p>
<p>Year 21 1,049 492 556</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the amount of trade deficit in the past 30 years is shocking. The trade deficit was lower in Year 6 of the Republic of China due to the European War and in Year 16 of the Republic of China due to the climax of the Chinese Revolution. However, in Year 20 of the Republic of China, imports were 140 million taels and exports were 90 million taels, with a trade deficit of 50 million taels. Year 21 of the Republic of China was even worse. In that year, imports were 100 million taels and exports were less than 50 million taels, with a trade deficit of more than 50 million taels. The trade deficit was even larger than the total amount of exports. No wonder the countryside collapsed, the people were poor, and industrialists and businessmen sighed. Comparing the trade deficit with the Boxer Indemnity, the trade deficit is even larger than the Boxer Indemnity. If this continues, with trade deficits every year, it is tantamount to paying indemnities every year, simply extracting countless fresh blood from the people of the whole country and flowing it abroad. We talk about national crisis, but in fact, the economic national crisis is more serious and more painful than everything else. When we talk about this, the cotton and wheat loan is only one of the problems in the economic difficulties. If the national economy is under control, and the national agriculture, industry, and commerce are generally adjusted, the economic problem will be solved, and cotton and wheat will no longer be a problem. Here we must also know that the so-called control and adjustment are not only for the benefit of a part of the people, but for the benefit of the entire nation. We must protect the interests of farmers and workers, and we must also protect the interests of industrialists and businessmen. Because Chinese industrialists and businessmen are too weak in the midst of the panic of the economic panic, and their business methods are too immature. If they are not protected, they will not be able to resist this panic. Therefore, in the implementation of economic control, we must take into account the interests of the entire nation. On the one hand, we must protect farmers and workers, and on the other hand, we must protect industrialists and businessmen. The Premier's industrial plan is that anything that belongs to the national nature is operated by the government, and anything that belongs to the private nature is operated by private individuals. What I am saying now is this meaning. I have already said that the stagnation of domestic cotton and wheat this year is due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, but the reason why unscrupulous merchants do this also has its inevitable reasons. Today, in the economic panic, everyone is harmed. Industrialists and businessmen are taking this manipulation under strategy in order to maintain their business. Since we do not want industrialists and businessmen to take this under strategy, we should give them middle strategies and upper strategies, so that the economic difficulties of industrialists and businessmen can be broken, and the economic difficulties of the people of the whole country can also be broken at the same time. In my recent reports, the first sentence says to enrich the people's strength, and the second sentence also says to enrich the people's strength. Some people say that this is a roundabout argument. In fact, this is a painful and urgent appeal. Just look at the customs numbers and you will feel it. In short, it is still</p>
<p>the old saying of enriching the people's strength. When the people's strength is enriched, the national strength can be revitalized. The way to enrich the people's strength is to protect the interests of farmers and workers, and at the same time to protect the interests of industrialists and businessmen. Only in this way is the interest of the entire nation. Of course, we must control the public economy, and at the same time we must develop the private economy. Only in this way is the economic policy of the entire country, not ambiguous talk. China's great problem is that one is lack of money, and the other is having money but not being able to use it well. This can be seen most clearly in this cotton and wheat loan. This is what we should pay close attention to. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Since the order for Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan to inspect Xinjiang was issued, there were rumors of a change in the central government's foreign policy and that the Foreign Minister would be replaced. We are unwilling to make any judgments on this before the facts are proven. Luo said to reporters, "Xinjiang borders foreign countries, and diplomatic relations are extremely complex. I hope to contribute my observations to the central government." Wang Jingwei also said when he took over as acting Foreign Minister that Luo's "trip is related to diplomatic relations and the entire Chinese nation, and its significance is extremely important." Therefore, Foreign Minister Luo's diplomatic mission to Xinjiang is indeed worthy of the attention of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Xinjiang has long been coveted by Britain and Russia. However, since the completion of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway by Soviet Russia five years ago, its aggressive southward advance has attracted special investigation by France and Germany. The crisis in our new province is self-evident. Britain also wants to include Xinjiang in its territory to complete its plan to monopolize Central Asia, as Xinjiang is adjacent to Afghanistan and India, which it controls. Recently, the Russian news agency also reported Japan's attempt to create a Manchurian-Mongolian empire, and its conspiracy also extended to Xinjiang, sheltering the deposed Turkish prince and planning to use him to incite our Hui people. This is just in terms of the individual actions of various countries. Furthermore, Soviet Russia's desire to communize Central Asia and Britain and its allies' desire to build an anti-communist defense line in Central Asia are both major crises for our Xinjiang. Under this international situation, the small warlords who are far away in Xinjiang do not know the danger of Mu Yan. On the one hand, they compete with each other with military force, and on the other hand, they each ally with strong neighbors to bring wolves into the house. After the recent changes, Chen Zhong went to Moscow on Liu Sheng's order before he was killed, and Zhang Peiyuan of Ili also had pro-Russian tendencies. Ma Shaowu of Shule is close to the British Ma Zhongying, according to the Russian side, is instructed by Japan. Thus, if Xinjiang is not to continue as the Northeast, with external pressure and internal division, unless there is a suitable plan and measure in diplomacy, no one dares to say so. After the railway network was laid in the Northeast and the industry gradually developed, it was invaded and occupied by violent Japan in one fell swoop. Can Xinjiang not be slaughtered by those who are eyeing it on the day when air routes are open and governance is easier? It is hoped that Foreign Minister Luo's trip can exert his intelligence to ease the encroachment of strong neighbors externally and persuade the brave generals internally to realize the crisis and restrain themselves.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Northeast disaster, the Chinese people mostly blamed Ambassador Wang Rongbao, who had been stationed in Tokyo for a long time, for failing to eliminate the disaster in advance. Wang Junyisheng wrote an article mourning Wang's death, briefly revealing the news of his painstaking efforts to prove that the central diplomatic authorities were ignorant of foreign affairs and only blindly followed slogans and should bear the blame. Luo is now traveling west as Foreign Minister to inspect. We deeply hope that he can have a broad vision and carefully plan a plan to deal with the foreign troubles in the Northwest. Not only will this eighth of the country's territory be maintained.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Crisis in Japanese Political Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The right-wing forces are growing secretly. It is feared that it will degenerate into a dictatorship. Diplomatic isolation and depleted national treasury. Future hidden worries are just beginning.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Takahashi Korekiyo Issues a Pessimistic Warning <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi recently issued a warning to reporters, saying that if the situation continues along its current path, Japan may be controlled by a dictatorship, which is a great cause for concern. This statement by Takahashi is by no means unfounded in the eyes of many close observers. The next few years will be an extremely difficult period for Japan. If it is to get through this difficult time smoothly, it will not succeed without noble perseverance and brilliant political skills. This kind of crisis can already be seen in the confessions of the young army and navy officers in the May 15th Incident last year. According to the confession of Lieutenant Yamagishi, Yamagishi shouted when assassinating Inukai Tsuyoshi, "It is useless to say more, why not fire?" As soon as this statement was issued, all the bullets were fired, and the elderly Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was shot to death. This kind of confession, in a very clear form, not only explains the immediate cause of the assassin's violence, but also clearly indicates that future hidden worries come from those who hold the same ideas and are just beginning. Yamagishi said, "We believe that when the London Naval Treaty expires in 1936, Japan will be in the greatest danger in its history. Therefore, we must take action before this treaty expires. We firmly believe that in addition to eliminating the various institutions that stand between the Imperial Family and the people, there is no other way to save Japan." The institutions that Yamagishi refers to are the Diet, the Zaibatsu, and the important positions around the Emperor. The reason why he wants to overthrow the Diet is because the Diet is occupied by politicians from various parties, and these politicians value the party more than the country. The reason why he wants to destroy the Zaibatsu is because the Zaibatsu are not only corrupt elements who echo politicians, but also are controlled by financial relations and do not consider the needs of national defense. Important positions in the Imperial Court, such as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal and the Grand Chamberlain, must also be eliminated by force, because their power can control everything, and even the strategies of the highest army and navy can be vetoed by them, as happened when the London Naval Treaty was signed. In other words, as far as the navy officers' participation in the May 15th violence is concerned, the navy's intention is that Japan should demand equality with Britain and the United States when the naval conference discusses the revision of the current treaty in 1935. They fear that politicians, the Zaibatsu, and those around the Emperor will obstruct this demand at that time, so there is a plan to overthrow the Diet, overthrow the Zaibatsu, and eliminate those around the Emperor. As a whole, the people of the country certainly do not agree with this violence, but there is no doubt that the motive of this violence has received great sympathy from the people. The violent people criticize the corruption of political parties for seeking their own interests, and the collusion between the Zaibatsu and politicians, which is not without basis. Although the means of the violent people are improper, their sincerity in loving the country is recognized by the people. Finance Minister Takahashi's statement warns that he is worried about the possibility of a dictatorship, and he probably knows the current forces in Japan that influence the psychology of the people. Fanatics are everywhere, and once they have the opportunity, they will sing the slogan of declaring war on Russia, the United States, or Britain to divert the attention of the people, or they will commit violence and terrorism again, such as the May 15th Incident, in order to force the authorities to adopt martial law and let the military seize power. The budget for next year is very short, the expenses are greatly increased, and the income is insufficient. How can it be maintained? Also, the naval conference will be held in 1935, and Japan will completely withdraw from the League of Nations in that year. How will it deal with foreign affairs? The people's hearts are restless, and complaints are frequently heard. How will it appease them? Seeing this, Takahashi's pessimistic warning may not necessarily become a reality, but it can also be seen that it is not without reason. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Navy Plans to Overthrow Makino to Eradicate Satsuma Faction Forces <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo News reported that Makino Nobuaki, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, has recently been rumored to be resigning again, because the naval murderers in the May 15th Incident hated Makino to the bone. They wanted to assassinate Makino four times before and after. It is also difficult for Makino to continue in this position. The naval murderers especially hate Count Makino, and the reasons are said to be very complicated. Here are a few reasons: 1. Makino is a representative of the remnants of the Satsuma faction, colluding with the Satsuma faction Navy. Whenever there is a political change, he divides the spoils with the political parties, which is too poisonous. 2. The Satsuma faction still maintains its power in the political world, and one of the main reasons is that Makino is the Emperor's close aide. 3. The Satsuma faction monopolizes the Navy, just like the Choshu faction, such as Yamagata, Terauchi, Tanaka, and Ugaki, monopolizes the Army. The Army created the Muto and Araki factions, and the Navy also wants to overthrow the Satsuma faction, so it must first overthrow Count Makino, whom it considers to be an accomplice. Although Makino has stated his resignation several times, the reason why he still remains in his current position is to maintain the power of the Satsuma faction. This time, it may come true.

<h3 id="e15">Political Association Seeks Cooperation with Cabinet by Accepting Humiliation <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Supporting Financial Groups to Control Warlords, Saito and Suzuki to Meet Tomorrow (Tokyo) The cooperation issue between the Seiyukai and the government is extremely complicated. Because after the public trial of the May 15th Incident, the anti-political party, especially anti-Seiyukai atmosphere, has become more intense throughout the country. Therefore, it is impossible for the Seiyukai to obtain political power. At present, they cannot obtain political power. They must find a way to turn around to maintain their interests. Capitalists under the control of the Mitsui zaibatsu and industrial capitalists across the country are strongly opposed to tax increases. The Seiyukai also wants to obtain a cooperative title, so that they can openly maintain Finance Minister Takahashi's financial policy and deal with the military's tax increase theory. Land Minister Araki regards the cooperation issue as a conspiracy to resist the military. The reason is here. Judging from the current situation, the Seiyukai seems not to dare to have extravagant hopes and lose the opportunity for cooperation (Twenty-first China League Electricity).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito is scheduled to meet with Seiyukai President Suzuki on August 23 to discuss the so-called coordination of national policy issues. President Suzuki seems to want to inquire about the government's national policy first, and then consult with the Seiyukai's various agencies on the general outline of countermeasures. On the 25th, President Suzuki will propose the Seiyukai's national policy outline. In the second meeting, the two sides will exchange opinions again, and decide on the final attitude on another day (Twenty-first China League Electricity).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The cooperation issue between the Japanese government and the Seiyukai has to go through many twists and turns before it can succeed. Pessimists say that the result will be failure. Optimists' opinions are as follows: ㈠ The purpose of coordinating national policy is to save the Seiyukai. In order to prevent division, cooperation is an inevitable process for the Seiyukai. ㈡ After the public trial of the May 15th Incident, the Seiyukai absolutely cannot obtain political power alone. ㈢ The atmosphere of military dictatorship is gradually becoming stronger. In order to avoid the demise of political parties, the Seiyukai has to accept humiliation. Pessimists' views are as follows: ㈠ The two factions within the Seiyukai are in serious opposition. If they cooperate with the government, the Seiyukai will definitely split. ㈡ President Suzuki is still dreaming of becoming prime minister. ㈢ The Seiyukai has already announced that its policies are incompatible with the government. From the perspective of a public party, it is not easy to change. Although there are two opposing views, the media mostly expects the Seiyukai to succumb. However, there are two ways to cooperate after compromise. It is unknown which one the Seiyukai will choose, that is, to establish a new National Policy Council and invite Suzuki to be its vice chairman. If the Minseito President and Adachi National Alliance President are each its members, this is the first method. The second method is to re-propose a minister without portfolio. It is expected that the vice chairman of the National Policy Council is promising (Twenty-first China League Electricity).</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida believes that after withdrawing from the League of Nations, it is necessary to correct the League of Nations' actions. Regarding Reischman's visit to China, he has always told the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that it can only be limited to technical assistance. That is, in the future, all League of Nations actions related to Japan must be beneficial to Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a diplomatic formation against the League of Nations. Since withdrawing from the League of Nations, both Ambassadors Sugimura and Sawada have left Geneva, leaving only Ito Nobushi, the Deputy Director of the Imperial Affairs Bureau. It is difficult to obtain information, and it is also difficult to express opinions to the League of Nations. It has been decided to deploy powerful diplomats in various European countries to monitor the League of Nations in Geneva in the near future. The formation is as follows: "France" Counselor Ito Nobushi, Second Secretary Kato Tsugijiro, and Kato Shintaro, "Belgium" Counselor Yokoyama Masato, Second Secretary Terasaki Taro, "Switzerland" Third Secretary Shibuzawa Shinichi, and Ando Yoshira. In addition, Foreign Minister Uchida believes that the date of formal withdrawal is imminent, and has decided to change the resident officials in Europe, ordering Ambassadors Sugimura and Sawada to reside in Europe (Twenty-first Dentsu Electricity).</p>

<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Decides to Send Shigemitsu to Receive Him</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Opinions are divided within the Japanese government regarding the issue of welcoming Finance Minister Soong. The military still insists on pursuing a policy of force and does not need to meet with Soong Tzu-wen, who is anti-Japanese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Japanese side has suffered greatly from the anti-Japanese movement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has tried its best to break this difficult situation from all aspects. This time, Finance Minister Soong's arrival is a good opportunity to change the situation. In addition, Zhang Gongquan, the general manager of the Bank of China, is mediating in the middle, and the result may not be unfavorable to Japan. It is heard that after the dispute, the Japanese government has decided to welcome Finance Minister Soong, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu is the receptionist. The East News reported that Zhang Gongquan will accompany Finance Minister Soong to meet with representatives of the Japanese financial community (Twenty-first China League Electricity).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It was previously reported that Chinese Finance Minister Soong Tzu-wen would return to China from San Francisco on the President Roosevelt and arrive in Yokohama on August 25. He would meet with Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu Aoi. Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that neither the Nanjing government nor Minister Soong himself had expressed that Soong wanted to talk to Shigemitsu Aoi (Twenty-first Reuters Electricity).</p>

<p>Demanding Direct Negotiations and Opposing Submission to Arbitration</p>
<p>(Paris) Japanese Ambassador to France Sawada, acting on instructions from the government, today made a strong verbal protest to the French Foreign Ministry regarding France's occupation of nine small islands in the Chinese sea. Based on the fact that the Japanese Lin Mining Company had operated on the islands, he solemnly demanded ownership of the islands, saying that the mining company had obtained the approval and full support of the Japanese government before operating on the islands. He then proposed that the two countries directly negotiate diplomatically to resolve the issue of ownership, saying that the Tokyo government would oppose the proposal to submit it to arbitration. Director of Political and Commercial Affairs of the French Foreign Ministry, Barton, promised to immediately study the Japanese protest and respond quickly (Twenty-first National News Agency Electricity).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable information, the Japanese representative in Paris, acting on instructions from the government, submitted a note to the French government on August 19, opposing France's occupation of the nine small islands between Vietnam and the Philippines. The Japanese government's protest is based on the results of the investigation by Tommisi Badie, an expert in international law at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Professor Tatsuo Rittaku of Meiji University. The two of them have been engaged in the legal research on the issue, and inferred the facts of the first discovery of the island. Regarding this matter, a professor at Meiji University recently wrote an article saying that the island should belong to Japan, and presented a map drawn in 1553 as proof. In this map, all nine islands have been listed, so the French claim that a French person discovered the island in the last century is not true. In addition, a book of maps was recently found in the Tokugawa family, which is 200 years old. It also includes these small islands, but the names are not noted (Twenty-first Reuters Electricity).</p>

<p>Japanese Emperor Returns to Yokosuka</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the final act of the Japanese Emperor's observation of the naval maneuvers in the South Pacific, he returned to Yokosuka this morning on the battleship Hiei. It is now scheduled to inspect the entire fleet outside Yokohama Port on August 25. This maneuver was divided into three acts. The first act was maneuvered in tropical waters in June and July. The second act was the preparation of the main fleet for a large-scale mock battle near the Ogasawara Islands. The third act was the decisive battle, which the Emperor personally observed and was held on August 19. The defending Red Fleet, commanded by Commander-in-Chief Nagano, fought against the Blue Fleet, commanded by Commander-in-Chief Kobayashi. At the same time, other warships also carried out local defense maneuvers in the naval bases of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Therefore, all 284 warships there were engaged in maneuvers (Twenty-first Reuters Electricity).</p>

<p>Dealing with the Austro-German Dispute</p>
<h3 id="e22">Joint Policy of Britain, France, and Italy <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining Austria's Independence, Preventing the Invasion of the Nazi Party's Forces Italian Prime Minister Hopes to Become Hegemon of Central Europe, Acts as Peacemaker, and Fully Supports Austria (Vienna) A certain VIP in Vienna's diplomatic circles claimed tonight that Britain, France, and Italy have agreed on a joint policy regarding the current Austro-German conflict. They have all agreed that if the National Socialist Party invades Austrian territory, or Germany attempts to overthrow the Dollfuss government by force, the three countries will take some kind of military action in order to maintain the status quo. It is also said that according to a telegram from Rome, Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss's flight to Rome for a secret meeting with Mussolini was for the purpose of establishing this agreement. However, this statement has not been confirmed by the official authorities. It is also heard that Dollfuss telegraphed his cabinet members here three hours after meeting with Mussolini, saying that the three countries had decided to immediately notify Germany of their decision. According to diplomatic sources here, Dollfuss telegraphed his cabinet members that this agreement among the three countries was agreed upon in Rome on Saturday, and that the plan was quite extensive, not only to protect Austria from the current crisis, but also to have a detailed plan that could ultimately lead to the creation of a Danube economic union. It is said that after the three countries agreed, they immediately telegraphed Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. At that time, the Austrian government was holding a cabinet meeting, so Dollfuss stopped the cabinet meeting and immediately ordered a plane to be prepared to fly to Rome. However, the content of the agreement and the extent to which the three countries would maintain the Austrian government have not been disclosed by diplomatic circles. It is only said that according to what they have heard, if the German National Socialist Party crosses the border, the three countries will immediately take military action. Although this news has not been confirmed by the official authorities, the tension between Germany and Austria and the Austrian Chancellor's visit to Rome were decided suddenly, which is known to everyone. It is rumored that Mussolini will provide Austria with unlimited assistance, which many knowledgeable people here do not believe, because the Four-Power Pact has just been established, and Mussolini will definitely act as a protector of peace and will not want to take further action. However, the statement of agreement among the three countries is still beyond the scope of Italy, only because it was published late, so it has not been confirmed by the official authorities so far. The conflict between Germany and Austria has been going on for several months. Austria accuses Germany of secretly helping the National Socialist Party here in an attempt to make things difficult for the government. Germany is angry that Austria is cracking down on German expatriates, saying that many German expatriates have been deported (Twentieth National News Agency Electricity).</p>
<h3 id="e23">Austrian Foreign Ministry Denies Military Action by Three Countries Against Germany <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Vienna) The Austrian Foreign Ministry dismissed as absurd the rumor that Britain, France, and Italy would take military action to protect Austria's independence in order to resist the National Socialist Party. A spokesman for the Austrian Foreign Ministry also said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had never mentioned this matter when talking with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss (Twenty-first Reuters Electricity).</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times published an editorial commenting on Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss's visit to Rome, saying, "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is eager to take the lead in Central Europe. He has recently successively met with German Deputy Chancellor Papen, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. It has long been secretly expected by the Italian Prime Minister. The authorities of various Central European countries have sent telegrams, which proves that the Italian government wants to be in a position to resolve disputes and solve problems. However, this task of mediation is actually very difficult. If Mussolini is willing to take on the task to the end, he may encounter various difficulties. Is the matter between Germany and Austria not a lesson? Italy negotiated with Germany on the issue of Germany's anti-Austrian propaganda, and Germany agreed to monitor radio stations so that this situation would not happen again. However, the anti-Austrian propaganda is still being broadcast. Germany's promise is not only completely ineffective, its authorities even deny the scope and value of this promise. In short, as of now, judging from various circumstances, the main parties involved in the German-Austrian issue not only deny the mediator, but also seem unwilling to recognize the principle of mediation. According to some Pan-German newspapers, the Roman authorities still believe that the German government will eventually fulfill its promises. But what will happen in the end, we will definitely know in the near future. I am afraid that those who trust Germany will mislead themselves. However, in any case, the Italian government can do a lot for Austria, to assist Dollfuss and preserve Austria's independence. Recently, various countries have wanted to incorporate Austria into the entire Danube economic issue and try to restore it to prosperity. Italy has obstructed it. Today, what we should do for Austria is not a broad plan, but to break the propaganda of the Hitler Party so that Austria can live. Germany's propaganda to Austria exaggerates Germany's prosperity, while exaggerating Austria's poverty. This is what we should stop. Austria is now suffering from Germany's exclusion, so France is planning to quickly provide the Austrians with assistance to develop its economy. If Italy can now join the policies taken by Britain and France, and in the future try to make the countries that were separated from the old Austrian Empire economically close to each other, then the position of those who are fighting for Austria's independence in Vienna will be consolidated, and the danger of Germanism can be avoided. Otherwise, Austria will inevitably fall into the hands of the National Socialist Party. If Austria belongs to the National Socialist Party, it will actually be completely controlled by the German National Socialist Party, and Germanism will flow like a flood, rushing directly towards the Adriatic Sea. If Germany gains power in the Alps, Italy's national prestige will be wiped out." (Twentieth)</p>

<p>(Rome) Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss came to Italy by plane yesterday and met with Prime Minister Mussolini in Rimini. According to a communiqué issued by the Stefani News Agency, "The Prime Minister and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss met and conducted a close study of the current situation from a general point of view and from an Italian point of view. Mussolini reiterated Italy's views on Austria's future, the entire Danube issue, and other more extensive issues. The solution to these issues will also depend on how the Four-Power Treaty is implemented. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss explained the Austrian situation and the international situation, starting from Austria's independence, saying that Austria is extremely willing to maintain a policy of peace and good neighborliness. Austria is willing to cooperate with all countries bordering Austria, especially Hungary and Italy, and also with Germany as soon as possible. At the end of the talks between the two Prime Ministers, they deeply felt that their opinions on the issues studied were consistent."

<p>(Vienna) Germany is still attacking the Austrian Dollfuss government. Even after Austria's repeated protests and the intervention of the great powers, it has not relaxed in the slightest. This can be evidenced by the speech of National Socialist Party Congressman Hapišut last night. Hapišut is a specialist in anti-Austrian propaganda. He gave a speech on the radio last night, pointing out how the Austrian government has received foreign aid. However, due to bad weather, only part of this speech was recorded. At the beginning, he said that Prime Minister Dollfuss would not be able to sustain himself without international aid. He continued to talk about the Austrian Chancellor's trip to Rimini, Italy, and strongly stated that the Dollfuss government has not only received the moral support of the great powers, but also relies on the financial and economic support of the great powers. In addition, it has also received the support of the Little Entente countries. This kind of international aid obviously wants to protect Austria from making any kind of union with Germany. This kind of action may temporarily enhance the position of Prime Minister Dollfuss, but the people of all Austrian provinces are returning to Germany, and they will not want to support a government that violates the will of the people. In conclusion, he said that the Austrian National Socialist Party representatives have also declared that they have the right to self-determination. Unless this right to self-determination is granted, neither Austria nor Europe can make them submit (Twenty-first Havas Telegram).</p>

<h3 id="e28">Authorities Declare No Change in Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>President Wang Persuades Liu Chongjie to Stay (Nanjing) There has been much speculation about the government's diplomatic policy changing due to Foreign Minister Luo Wengan's long-term and long-distance tour. According to those in authority, the central government's diplomatic policy has always been decided by the Central Political Council, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is only an executive agency. Therefore, the Foreign Minister's tour and whether or not he is replaced do not affect foreign policy. Moreover, there is one thing that can be proven, that is, Soong Tzu-wen is still on the way. If the diplomatic policy were to change, it should wait until Soong returns to the country. It can be seen that the so-called transfer of diplomatic policy is unreliable at present. In addition, there have been frequent telegrams from Europe and the United States inquiring about the diplomatic policy and whether there is a tendency to change. There is also a speculation that although the diplomatic policy will not be changed, it is better to change to a more agreeable person for the sake of debt relations with Japan, so that we can cope with the situation temporarily and avoid a stalemate. Therefore, the government will issue an unofficial message in the near future, stating that the government will not change its diplomatic policy, and will continue to trust the League of Nations to the end. It goes without saying that it will not recognize the puppet state of Manchuria (Twenty-first Special Telegram).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Foreign Minister Luo Wengan toured Xinjiang, Vice Minister Liu Chongjie resigned. After President Wang personally persuaded him to stay, his intention to resign is expected to be dispelled. He returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 21st and went to the ministry to work as usual.

<p>Trains Towed Over the Bridge by Small Locomotives</p>
<p>(Beiping) The water level of the Yellow River on the Pinghan Railway has gradually dropped. The 77th and 78th piers of the iron bridge have been padded with steel plates.

<p>Oil Industry Regulations Still to be Revised</p>
<p>Government Decides to Support Gold Mining Industry Reuters dispatch, Washington, 20th - President Roosevelt today agreed to the Oil Industry Representatives' organization committee's proposed revision of the Oil Industry Regulations. This is because the oil industry has repeatedly requested reservations and raised objections to these regulations. Oil industry leaders have agreed to abide by the President's proposal. The National Industrial Recovery Act office's proposal of three-month trial regulations for the steel and oil industries seems determined to implement a policy of raising prices. The cotton textile industry has increased production costs after implementing regulations and handling fees, so it has been forced to increase selling prices to a degree that hinders sales, which may cause cotton mills to close down, it is unknown.</p>
<p>National dispatch, Washington, 20th - Since Congressman Englebright met with the US President yesterday to propose amending the gold ban to support the gold mining industry, mining machinery worth millions has already been in transit to the western gold mining areas, and there are plans to hire 50,000 more miners. This will be implemented after the gold ban is changed. This action shows that gold mine owners anticipate that Mr. Englebright's proposal will receive sympathy from the White House and a favorable decision will be made.</p>

<p>Fortunately, No Conflicts Occurred Fan Leira Decides to Maintain Power Holding a General Election is Not Yet Necessary National dispatch, Dublin, 20th - Today, the capital of the Irish Free State, Dublin, and several other places held large parades of the Irish Fascist Party. After the government banned the Blue Shirts' mass demonstration last Sunday, the Blue Shirts formed this fascist parade organization. No unfortunate incidents occurred during today's parade. However, in Dublin, the Irish Republican Army also organized a counter-parade and placed wreaths at the tombs of revolutionary martyrs Collins and Griffiths. The parade organized by the Blue Shirts was far away and was monitored by the police and militia, who specially designated the parade location to prevent any contact or conflict. When the Fascist parade began, Blue Shirt leader General O'Duffy sent a declaration stating that the advancement of the Fascist movement in Ireland could no longer be stopped. This declaration was simultaneously read aloud in the various parade gatherings. Reuters dispatch, Dublin, 20th - The whole city was very quiet today except for a few small conflicts, but people were tense all day. A Reuters reporter learned from the National Guard headquarters that the Blue Shirts will parade across the country according to the pre-arranged procedure, but the detailed plan has not been revealed. Parades everywhere will read the declaration of General O'Duffy, Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard, which includes words such as "If politics is a matter of dispute, then the time to abolish politics has arrived." Van Leira said in a speech in Sells that if the Minister of Justice receives a report tomorrow that the Blue Shirts paraded in uniform today, he will declare the Blue Shirts an illegal organization. He also said that anyone who publicly admits to belonging to the group will be punished according to the Public Security Law. Van Leira also announced that there is no need to hold a general election in the Free State now. He feels that there is no need to hold a general election before the government's term expires. General O'Duffy replied to Van Leira's threat to ban the Blue Shirts, saying that the National Guard will neither disband itself nor allow others to push it into the abyss. If the government designates the legally organized National Guard as an illegal organization, then the government is simply committing treason. Reuters learned that the government instructed all police stations this morning to provide full protection when the Blue Shirts parade in formation, and then escort them back to their hometowns.</p>

<p>Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Ren An The District Magistrate's Communication on the People's Suffering in the Disaster Area, and the Bandit Situation in Qingjiang. Due to the influence of neighboring counties, although the urban and rural areas have been pacified, there is still hidden worry in the remote mountainous areas. The current District Magistrate, Cheng Zhenxi, is said to be a graduate of Great China University, young and promising, and has achieved remarkable results in pacifying the countryside. The reporter visited and was told the following: The people of this county are suffering greatly. The bandit trouble has not been eliminated, the wounds have not healed, and the burden of taxes has become increasingly heavy. In the past, products such as rice, cloth, medicinal materials, and timber could be sold smoothly abroad, but now, due to the bandit blockade, the goods are stagnant, and the social economy is on the verge of exhaustion. Fertile fields, which used to be worth one to two hundred silver dollars per mu, are now being sold for only thirty to forty dollars, and no one is even making an offer. In addition, there was a flood the year before last and a rich disaster last year. The collapse of the rural areas is particularly difficult to contain. The China International Famine Relief Commission came here to lend 30,000 yuan, but due to the manipulation and usury of local bullies, the farmers were harmed instead. The shortage of plowing cattle this spring is due to selling cattle to repay debts. As for tax collection and corvée labor, the people regard them as fierce tigers. The government takes one tenth, but the people bear one hundred and twenty. For example, the tobacco and alcohol tax is widely distributed. Those who hold Class C licenses are forced to obtain Class B, and those who hold Class B licenses are forced to obtain Class A. If the clerks' extortion fails, lawsuits arise. The county government, as an intermediary, is caught in a dilemma. If it loves the people, it will offend the superiors; if it protects the clerks, it will wrong the people. This kind of unspeakable hidden pain can only be known by a county magistrate who is deeply involved with the people. The national tax is already like this. Other miscellaneous taxes, such as the "bed frame house," are so numerous that one can imagine. Jiangxi's banditry is frequent, and the people are in deep water and scorching fire, more than any other province. The government's finances should be clearly established and these miscellaneous taxes urgently eliminated in order to relieve the people's livelihood, so that they can concentrate their efforts to assist in suppressing the Red bandits. With this, I will be very fortunate." The reporter took his leave and returned to his residence. On the way, he suddenly recalled that in the Zhangshu Chamber of Commerce, he had heard that the county magistrate had recovered 50,000 yuan in old Ding tax arrears during the period of food shortage, and the Department of Civil Affairs had given him a commendation. As for the farmers who were imprisoned and subjected to corporal punishment, they were full of complaints. The so-called "loving the people will offend the superiors" actually contains the hidden meaning of "if you don't want to offend the superiors, it is difficult to love the people." It is probably impossible to find something that is both difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Going west along the Yuan River, one enters the boundaries of Xinyu and Fenyi counties. Both county towns have also been occupied by bandits, and most of the county government organs have been burned down. Two District Magistrates of Fenyi County have also been kidnapped one after another. The field deeds and bonds in each district were mostly collected and burned, and signs of future distribution were inserted in the fields. On the walls of the village crossroads, Red bandit slogans such as "Soldiers are all from the working class and peasants, don't use guns to hit the working class and peasants," "Overthrow the local tyrants and divide the land," and "Oppose warlord infighting" were everywhere. Now, with the great army encircling and suppressing them, many villages have been recovered one after another. However, there are still many bandit dens in the high mountains and ridges of Henan. Without the protection of the army, it is difficult to harvest the grain within five miles of the river. The people in the area bordering the bandit areas have a particularly heavy responsibility for assisting in the suppression. Taking the "Bao" office expenses as an example, regardless of gender, age, or youth, each person must pay four copper coins per month, otherwise the Bao head can arbitrarily exploit them. The tenant farmers are less concerned about the field deeds being burned, but the creditors are afraid that the bonds will be destroyed and they will lose their basis in the long run. They seek immediate compensation, as urgently as a shooting star, and even impose a time limit for payment, with heavy penalties for overdue payments. If the debtor sells all his calves and small carts, he is still oppressed in the name of debt.</p>
<p>Xinyu is rich in rice and grain, which is self-sufficient and more than enough. Hundreds of thousands of dan can be transported to foreign countries every year, but the water transportation cost is very high, and farmers often feed pigs with white rice. Fenyi is rich in wood, but recently, due to traffic jams, timber companies have closed down one after another. The commerce in the two county towns is declining because the north of the river has many market towns, which used to be customers from Henan, but now they are also bandit-ridden. The desolate scene in the city is especially unbearable to behold. (August 8th)</p>

<p>The Weak Dikes are Extremely Dangerous The Floodwaters from the Breach have Entered the Zheng River through Taochengbou A dispatch from Jinan states that the flood-stricken area in western Shandong has expanded to ten counties. The loss of life and property is incalculable, and it is a catastrophe that has not occurred in recent decades. After the water from the breach at Shitou Village on the north bank entered the territory of Fan County, it flowed down the embankment river. The water is deep and the embankment is weak, making it precarious. Puyang and Shouzhang counties are also reporting that they are in critical condition. The golden embankment in this area has not seen water for many years, and suddenly encountering this flood, the low-lying areas are already level with the water, and the high areas are only two or three inches above the water. If it were to collapse again, it would flood into the northern depressions, and the floods would continue to expand between the Jinpu and Pinghan lines. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, seeing the critical situation, telegraphed the relevant county magistrates to quickly mobilize laborers to rescue the situation. Zhang himself also rushed to supervise the work. It has been raining heavily in the upstream areas for days, and the water level is still rising. Yesterday, Chang Yu, in Fan County, supervised the militia and the Public Security Bureau to build sub-embankments. At 3:00 AM on the 18th, the water from the breach re-entered the Zheng River through Taochengbou. The Zheng River water level suddenly rose by seven centimeters, causing all three sections of the river to become critical at the same time. The River Affairs Bureau has telegraphed the downstream section chiefs, the second, third, and fourth sections on the south bank and the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sections on the north bank, to step up precautions. Shi Jiefan, the Magistrate of Juye County, telegraphed that the river water had entered the fourth and fifth districts of the county on the 15th, and that sixty or seventy villages along the river were completely submerged. Zhuang Shouchong, the Magistrate of Shouzhang County, telegraphed that the water in the second district of the county was level with the embankment, and the water surrounded the city wall in a vast expanse. On the 17th and 18th, the water level rose sharply by another two feet, and the flow was still turbulent. In addition to the county magistrate Chang Yu organizing rescue efforts, he also informed the neighboring counties of Yanggu, Chaocheng, and Fan County to provide assistance. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, is extremely concerned about the flood disaster, and has repeatedly telegraphed the central government for relief, but has not yet received a reply. Today, he received another telegram from Zhang Lianjia from Taochengbou, reporting on the water</p>
<p>situation, stating that the river water has entered the Zheng River through Taochengbou, and that the embankments in Fannan County, Douhudian, Jilou, and Guankou, Shuzukou, Lianhuachi, and Ziludi in Shouzhang County are low and dangerous. He has notified Chaocheng and Yanggu counties to assist. Xu Baonong, Deputy Engineer of the North China Water Conservancy Commission sent by the Ministry of Interior, came from Hebei on the 21st to survey the river works, and started his investigation from Zhukou on the south bank. Based on the situation in recent days, the river works have reached the most dangerous period. Government officials and civilians are working together to fight the flood, but it is not yet known whether they can avert the catastrophe.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Sun Ke and Feng Yuxiang Tour Mount Tai <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Great Enthusiasm in the Misty Mountain Rain Feng Hosted Everyone at Taian's Three Beauties White Cabbage, Tofu, and Water A dispatch from Jinan states that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and his party traveled by special train from Jinan to Taian at 8:30 PM on the 18th to visit the scenic spots of Mount Tai and to visit Feng Yuxiang, who has retired to the Five Worthies Shrine on Mount Tai. The reporter accompanied the train. The train traveled very quickly, stopping only briefly at Zhangxia, and arrived in Taian at 10:30 PM. At that time, Feng Yuxiang was in the Five Worthies Shrine on the mountain. Because it was late at night, he was unable to come down the mountain to greet them, so he sent Zhang Jiyong to represent him at the station to welcome them and provide for everything. Zhou Baisuo, the County Magistrate, also led representatives from various organizations, the militia, and the Public Security Bureau to the station to welcome them. After Sun and his party got off the train, they stayed at the Jinpu Railway Taian Hotel. At 6:00 AM this morning (19th), Feng Yuxiang came down the mountain to the hotel to meet Sun. At 9:00 AM, they climbed the mountain together. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and it rained heavily. Feng, Sun, and others braved the rain to travel, visiting Mantoushi, Heilongtan, Changshou Bridge, Five Worthies Shrine, Puzhao Temple, Dai Temple, and other places. Finally, because the road was wet and the mountain was slippery, they did not reach the summit. Because Sun and others did not achieve their goal, they plan to stay in Taian for another day and wait for the weather to clear tomorrow morning before going straight to the summit. The meetings between Feng and Sun, and the tours, are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e58">Meeting between Sun and Feng <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Sun arrived in Taian last night and got off the train to rest at the Jinpu Railway Taian Hotel. It was originally planned to climb the mountain early this morning to visit Feng and tour the scenic spots, but when the train arrived in Taian last night, it was already covered with thick clouds and looked like it was about to rain. At dawn today, the misty fog turned into heavy rain. Many of his companions looked worried, thinking that today's plan would be sacrificed. At about 6:00 AM, Feng Yuxiang suddenly brought several guards, still wearing his blue cloth trousers and jacket from his trip to Jinan, wearing a large straw hat, and braved the rain to come down the mountain to welcome Mr. Sun to the Taian Hotel. At that time, Sun had already gotten up and went outside the house to greet him, shook hands, and introduced the visiting committee members to Feng. (Those who came with him included Central Committee member Ma Junchao, Shi Ci Liu Weichi, Legislative Committee member Chen Junpu, etc.) After a while, the committee members excused themselves, leaving only Sun and Feng in the room, sitting knee to knee and chatting happily. At that time, the rain outside the room suddenly became heavy, then light, then intermittent. The proposal to climb the mountain also wavered. An hour later, Sun called for tea and snacks to eat with Feng, and invited the committee members to accompany them. During the meal, they talked happily about the domestic situation and the world situation. After the meal, the rain still had not stopped, so Feng, Sun, and others continued to talk and relax in the room.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Braving the Rain to Climb the Mountain <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>At nine o'clock, the rain gradually subsided, although it was still drizzling like silk, it did not damage their enthusiasm. Feng, Sun, and others then set off to climb the mountain in the drizzle. At that time, the reception staff of the Jinpu Jiaoji Railway Bureau had already hired more than thirty mountain sedan chairs, numbered them, and waited for a long time. Sun, Feng, and others got into the sedan chairs and set off. All the way, the bitter wind and rain came together, but the air was fresh and stimulated their interest. The grass and trees were lush, the mountains and rocks were washed clean, and the mountain waterfalls and torrents roared. After moving for a while, they arrived at the western foot of Mount Tai. Continuing forward, they gradually climbed higher, and the scenery became better and better. Looking up at the high peaks piercing the clouds, they were leisurely and graceful. Mr. Sun and his companions looked left and right, their interest was strong. Walking and walking again, they arrived at Mantou Rock. The stone is shaped like a steamed bun, about ten feet high. The words "Huixing" are engraved on the stone, as well as the slogan "Feng Yuxiang is the loving mother of the poor," followed by "Public Praise of the People of Taian." Below the stone is a mountain stream, with a sloping stone slope that is flat and large. At one end of the stone, Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee, engraved "Chang Le Wo Jing" and a section of Buddhist scriptures. At the other end is a section of Mozi's Non-Aggression, which Feng Yuxiang engraved last year when he lived on Mount Tai. The words are as big as a dou, written in clerical script, covering a large area, and the engraving is also exquisite.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Residence of Feng <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Going further from Mantou Rock, passing Waterfall Pavilion and Longevity Bridge, one arrives at the Five Worthies Shrine where Feng lives. The shrine is divided into three courtyards. The central one is the shrine hall, the eastern courtyard houses the guards, and Feng resides in the western courtyard. There are three north-facing rooms and two east and west-facing rooms. Feng lives in the north-facing rooms, and the east and west rooms serve as residences for messengers. Feng's room is quite small, with two square tables placed together in the middle as Feng's writing and reading area. A bed is placed diagonally in the southeast corner, without mosquito nets, only a mat and a quilt, all made of coarse cloth. Feng sleeps here. The west wall has a window filled with old books, seemingly the Twenty-Four Histories. Beneath the south window is another small table with several new books. The courtyard is about twenty feet square, with three trees, one large and two small. In the center is a stone pavilion with inscriptions, saying "Waiting Stone". To the south is a short wall, from which one can have a distant view, with the city, the railway station, all in sight, and clearly distinguishable. Looking afar, even the Ji River and the Great Ji River are within view. To the north, there are towering peaks, with a magnificent landscape. Below this is the Puzhao Temple, where Feng used to live. Now, most of Feng's subordinates live in that temple. Another unit of guards lives in Sanyang Temple.</p>

<p>Sun and Feng's party toured the Five Views to the Worthy Shrine and rested at Feng's residence. It was already noon. Feng ordered a meal to be prepared for the guests. After a short while, the guards carried in two large steaming baskets, full of hot steam. The guests did not know what they contained. Upon opening them, they found black flour buns. Soon after, dishes were brought in, including two large plates of mixed tofu, a large bowl of stewed cabbage, a large bowl of stir-fried green beans, a large bowl of steamed eggplant, a plate each of stir-fried chicken and stir-fried shredded pork, a bowl of meat balls, and a plate of pickles. The plates and bowls were very large, with a lot of food. Each person was given a pair of chopsticks and an empty plate. Because there were few seats and many people, they gathered around Feng's writing desk and feasted. Chopsticks flew, and it was quite lively. Because the eating method was unique, everyone enjoyed it. During the meal, Feng told everyone, "Tai'an has three beauties: cabbage, tofu, and water. Now, please taste the beauties of Tai'an." After he finished speaking, everyone rushed to eat the tofu and cabbage, which were quickly finished, while the meat balls, shredded pork, and chicken were left behind. The canned fish and other items brought by Director Sun were rarely touched. After the meal, it was estimated that each person ate more than usual. After the meal, they shared watermelons from Dezhou in the courtyard. The watermelon tasted sweet and delicious, and many southerners had never eaten it before. Tasting it was like receiving sweet dew. Those with cameras took photos to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Conversation between Sun and Feng <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The reporter took the opportunity to talk to Sun, asking about his feelings and experiences after visiting Jinan and Mount Tai and meeting Feng and Han in the past few days. Sun said, "The politics of Shandong Province are better than other provinces, and the local public security is well maintained. Yesterday, I spent the whole day sightseeing in Jinan and did not have time to talk in detail with Chairman Han. In the rush of the conversation, no issues were touched upon. Jinan's mountains and rivers are beautiful, the scenery is pleasant, and the city has also progressed compared to the past. However, the lack of running water is a major shortcoming. The quality of Jinan's spring water is unparalleled, and the source is abundant and inexhaustible. It is a pity that it cannot be utilized, missing a great opportunity. The locals should utilize the natural water source to build a water company. The purpose of my trip to Tai'an this time is to visit Mount Tai, and meeting Mr. Feng was a coincidence. There was no prior appointment. During the meeting, we just chatted casually and did not discuss any important matters. Feng firmly advocates joint unity internally and presiding over national affairs to save the country from its perilous state. I did not ask whether Feng would go to Beijing, and we did not talk about his future." The reporter also asked about Feng's meeting with Sun, and Feng also said, "We didn't talk about anything important, just chatted casually." The reporter further asked how his mountain life had been in the past two days. Feng replied, "It's been alright. I get up at five o'clock every day, look at the mountains, write, and read, and don't ask about other things. I have invited two teachers who teach classes every day, one after another, so I am quite busy. I mainly study social sciences, followed by the Twenty-Four Histories." The reporter asked again when he would be going to Beijing. He replied, "I have decided to go, but the time has not yet come." When asked if Jiang and Wang had sent any telegrams, he replied, "No."</p>
<h3 id="e63">Touring the Dai Temple <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>After the group finished lunch at the Three Sages Shrine and rested for a while, they followed the old path. Feng stood at the door, shaking hands with each of the tourists to say goodbye, exchanging words of farewell, and then returned to the Five Worthies Shrine to rest. On the way back, Sun also visited Puzhao Temple, strolling among the ancient pines of the Six Dynasties, and then went down the mountain, heading straight to the Dai Temple to see the temple halls, murals, Han cypresses, and Tang scholar trees. They greatly admired these great ancient sites, but were very saddened by the poor maintenance and damage. By the time they returned to the Tai'an Hotel, it was already past three o'clock in the afternoon (19th).</p>
<h3 id="e64">Overview of Customs Revenue in the Past Six Months <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Losses of Approximately Six Million Yuan in Yu and Qin Customs</p>
<p>Beijing News: China's financial revenue mainly comes from customs duties and salt taxes. Since the Northeast Incident, the loss of customs duties and salt taxes has reached tens of millions of yuan annually. This spring, the violent Japanese army again launched an invasion of Yu, followed by a hot war, which lasted for half a year, resulting in significant losses. As the North China Truce Agreement was signed and the war zones were successively taken over, the Ministry of Finance authorities prepared to take over and restore the Qinhuangdao and Yuguan customs, which had been affected by the war and evacuated earlier. According to a senior official of the Ministry of Finance, the losses in tax revenue since the outbreak of the Yu-Rehe war, and the overview of customs revenue in recent months, are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e65">Losses in Tax Revenue from the Yu-Rehe War <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the General Inspectorate of Customs have repeatedly announced the amount of losses after the fall of the three northeastern provinces and the relocation of customs for tax collection. However, since January 1st of this year, when the violent Japanese army launched an invasion of Yuguan, followed by the attack on Rehe, approaching Tianjin and Beijing, the Shanhai and Qinhuangdao customs were under pressure from the Japanese army and successively evacuated to safe areas, merging into the Tianjin Customs for office work. Since the North China Truce Agreement was signed, the war zones have been gradually taken over. The Qinhuangdao Customs has now been restored to its original state. As for the personnel taking over Yuguan, they are preparing to go at the same time as the military authorities taking over personnel. Counting from January to the present, nearly eight months, although there is no large amount of revenue from the Yu and Qin customs, according to past statistics, the monthly revenue of the two customs was between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Assuming eight months, excluding the loss of salt tax, the loss of customs duty alone, although there are no detailed statistics now, is still in the range of six million.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Overview of Accumulated Revenue in the Past Six Months <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Yu-Rehe War, customs duties have been affected first. Subsequently, the war in North China expanded, and the suppression of bandits also increased military expenditure, so the government approved the increase in import tax rates from May 22nd of this year to provide funds. Based on the increased tax rates, it was estimated that the monthly revenue could be increased by about 2,000,000. However, just after the tax rates increased, it was the summer off-season. Therefore, in the past few months, although import tax rates have increased, the increase in tax revenue has been limited compared to before June, with a monthly increase of only 300,000 to 500,000. The tax revenue for this month has not yet been reported to the Ministry, but it is expected to improve compared to June and July. September and October are the peak months for customs, and the increase in customs duties can be predicted. (Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Su Shen, Zhang Yilin and Others Urge the Abolition of Additional漕折 Tax <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Letter: Elders of four counties of Suzhou Prefecture, Wu, Changshu, Jiangyin, Kunshan, including Zhang Yilin, telegraphed to the Provincial Government yesterday, "Chairman Gu and all members of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, regarding the Suzhou Province additional漕折 tax case, Yilin and others believe it is illegal, harms farmers, breaks faith, and have appealed for years. Initially, based on laws, we made reasonable arguments. Then, we described the disasters of war and made pitiful appeals, doing everything possible to seek a comprehensive solution. The high officials of the court listened attentively, and the central departments were deeply concerned, repeatedly ordering reductions and exemptions. The provincial government either shelved, reported dismissal, protested, or secretly requested, all to avoid cutting off the livelihood of the people, leaving some leeway. Yilin and others are hoarse and exhausted, and do not want to say more. However, witnessing the collapse of the rural economy, we fear that even the regular tax can hardly be maintained, let alone the additional tax. The situation thereafter is truly unimaginable. Speaking briefly about the facts, we report to the superiors: the drastic drop in rice prices affects the stagnation of finance, and the rent折 rate rises and falls, based on the rice price. At this time, before the new harvest, the rice price has fallen to nearly five yuan. When the new grain comes on the market, it will definitely be cheaper than now. If heaven is merciful, each mu yields two shi of rice, each shi worth five yuan. If we analyze it, besides the cost of grain, labor, cattle feed, fertilizer, what is left? Borrowed rice must be repaid, pawned items must be redeemed, and supplies must be stored for winter. This meager amount is not enough to distribute. How can there be any surplus to pay rent and taxes? Nineteen out of ten landowners belong to the middle class, relying on tenants paying rent as a lifeline. If the actual selling price of rice is five yuan, then the rent collected will be reduced accordingly. Who does not have savings, who does not have expenses? With a sudden reduction in income, rent arrears will accumulate. This is only speaking of those who have rent to collect. If the tenants, due to poverty, unanimously fail to pay, the landowners will only have property to lose, and no more taxes to pay. Recently, no one asks about the sale of land, there are those who abandon their property without being able to sell it, and there are definitely no those who bring money to buy land. This is a hidden worry about the changing state of society, truly the result of overlapping and increased taxes. At this time, the provincial government must first know that the regular tax is already precarious, and still wants to arbitrarily increase the additional tax. Is this not digging one's own grave? The provincial government understands the advantages and disadvantages, and must be moved by it. Yilin and others cannot bear to deceive, and dare not not report. All are current phenomena, and there is no need to cite Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the prestige of the central departments to waste ink with the provincial government. But people are not plants, and have reached the brink of extinction. Who can remain silent? We still implore that the case of the approval by the central departments to reduce the additional漕折 tax in Wu, Changshu, Kunshan, Jiangyin and other four counties in the 21st year be followed, and the funds be retained separately. Starting from the 22nd year, the item of additional漕折 tax be abolished, and no longer increased, declared to the public to dispel doubts. We await your clear instructions."</p>

<p>The Fengjing Temporary Security Corps arrested a bandit named Gu A'gen on the sixth day of the abolished lunar June and sent him to the county government for detention. The corps reported again yesterday, according to the head of Jietian Township, Lu Lanzhou, that since the arrest of the bandit Gu A'gen, guest bandits have frequently harassed the township and robbed four families, including Niu Shun's, and beat the victims. Afterwards, the victims checked their losses, which were minor, and they secretly dared not report for fear of making enemies with the bandits. The township head, due to his responsibility, reported the robberies to the authorities for investigation. After receiving the report, the corps has forwarded it to the county government for review.</p>

<p>In the case of the tragic deaths of Xi Weiquan and his wife at Huayang Bridge, Xu Guanxiang and Wu Zixiang have already been arrested by Yang Shijie of the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team and Fei Gongxia and brought to justice. Recently, Yang Shijie of the Public Security Bureau learned that the main suspect in the shooting of Xi Weiquan and his wife, Shen A'he, was hiding in the Caojing coastal area under the guise of carrying goods. He immediately led detectives Shen Guichang, Ye Bingsheng, Zhang Xueqing, and two special agents to pursue him. Near a thatched hut about five li east of Xuli Bridge, they saw Shen A'he relieving himself in the fields. The four detectives surrounded him from all sides. Seeing that the situation was not good, the suspect resisted with stones and sharp scissors and tried to escape. The detectives fired warning shots. The suspect was shot through both legs and was subdued. It was 6:00 PM on the 20th. He was escorted to Songjiang by hired boat from Fengxian today (21st) and is currently being interrogated by the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>The various branches of District One of this county held elections for county representatives to the party congress this morning (21st) at 9:00 AM and in the afternoon, and both met the legal quorum. However, the supervisors appointed by the county executive committee suddenly resigned, citing threatening letters as the reason. The executive committee convened an emergency meeting and decided to send someone to the province for instructions, while ordering all branches to suspend the election temporarily. The branches were quite dissatisfied and also sent people to the province to report. It is said that the dispute was actually caused by competition for the number of representatives.</p>

<h3 id="e71">A Tragedy Occurs Due to Discord Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>In Fengjing Township, in the area of the outer city of Loumen, Suzhou City, Yu Shuigen, the son of Yu Futing, a farmer, lived a modest but comfortable life. Eleven years ago, Futing, through a matchmaker, married a woman surnamed Wu from Xixi Lane as his daughter-in-law. She has a six-year-old child named Jinsheng. However, Jinsheng was naughty, and Futing's elderly wife, Gu, had a poor relationship with her daughter-in-law, Wu, leading to the tragedy of Wu, holding her son Jinsheng, throwing herself into the river and dying last night (20th). The case has caused a sensation far and wide, moving listeners to tears. The details are recorded below. It is said that on the day before (20th), Gu scolded her grandson Jinsheng for being naughty. Jinsheng, being scolded, cursed his grandmother. Gu, seeing the child curse, suspected that his mother, Wu, had instigated him, and spoke harshly to her daughter-in-law. Wu, feeling wronged, again beat her son Jinsheng. Gu, feeling sorry for her grandson, cursed her daughter-in-law with vicious words, vowing to fight her. When Shuigen returned home at night, he forced Wu to be driven away and not allowed to enter the house again. Although Shuigen did not obey the order to drive Wu away, he wantonly destroyed the things in the house to vent his anger. Wu, seeing her husband acting like a madman, felt heartbroken and, pretending to be calm, took the opportunity to hug her son Jinsheng and throw herself into the nearby river to commit suicide. At first, Shuigen and others suspected that Wu had taken her son out to cool off and did not suspect anything else. Later, the gatekeeper Yu Genhai heard a strange noise in the river and ran to tell Shuigen. In the darkness, he hired people to help dredge the river, and after an hour, they finally recovered the bodies. Wu was still holding her son tightly, looking extremely tragic. Yesterday morning (21st), the local bailiff entered the city to report to the local court, which sent a prosecutor out of the city to examine the bodies at 10:00 AM, and then ordered them to be coffined. The aunt, Gu, and husband, Shuigen, were ordered to be summoned by the relevant third sub-station of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the court for review.</p>

<p>The Business Tax Bureau, having been ordered to reorganize and increase the tax amount by 60,000 yuan, notified the Chamber of Commerce, asking each industry association to nominate representatives separately. After the industries nominated representatives, they went to the tax bureau yesterday to discuss the matter, presenting the situation of commercial decline and asking them to consider the merchants' difficulties and exempt them from the increase. The bureau stated that the provincial order was difficult to violate and could not be agreed to. Therefore, each industry submitted a report to the provincial government, requesting a temporary postponement of the increase.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Dispute Over Collection of Road Maintenance Fees for Business Vehicles <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Xi-Cheng Long-Distance Bus Company recently submitted an application to the Construction Department to undertake the Xi-Lu road maintenance project and collect road maintenance fees, which caused repercussions from business car owners. They once petitioned the Wuxi County Government, and it is still under review by the department. However, the Jiangyin section of the road maintenance project has been handed over to the company by Cheng County. On the day before (20th), the company set up a fee collection station in Nanzha of Cheng County to start collecting road maintenance fees and established an inspection station in Qingyang. Because business car owners were unwilling to pay fees to the company, yesterday (21st), cars traveling from Cheng to Xi were blocked by the Nanzha fee collection station. Cars traveling from Xi to Cheng were able to pass unhindered because they normally paid fees to the Wuxi County Government. However, when returning from Cheng to Xi, they were also blocked. This aroused the public anger of business car owners in Xi and Cheng counties. At 10:30 AM, they nominated representatives Xing Jiewen and others, carrying a document to the Jiangyin County Government to petition. When they arrived at the Qingyang bus station, all the cars temporarily stopped and explained the situation of petitioning to Cheng to the station chief and police of the town's Public Security Second Sub-Bureau. They then passed through. Around 12:00, when they arrived at the Nanzha station, they stopped as usual to explain. Somehow, a dispute arose with Jiang Meichu, an employee of the fee collection station. Jiang's head was smashed, and he was covered in blood and injuries. The glass windows in the room were also smashed. There were many people and many hands involved, and many onlookers. The station's security corps immediately arrested people, but everyone fled. For the sake of demonstration, the security corps fired a shot into the sky and arrested three people on the spot: car driver Yang Jusheng and A Nan, and took them to the corps headquarters for custody. All the cars were stopped on the station road, and traffic was blocked, creating a serious situation. The town's security corps telegraphed the Jiangyin County Government for instructions. County Magistrate Ruan ordered that everyone be released. Around 4:00, the cars of the petitioning group sped off to Jiangyin. As of the time this reporter filed the report, there were no results of the petition.</p>

<p>Zhou, a resident of Zhouxiang, Miaoqiao Township, District Thirteen (Xin'an Township) of this county, is a brewer. Two years ago, he built a new house among the fields. After moving in, all the members of his family, big and small, suffered from scabies. However, he thought it was a contagious disease and not surprising. Afterwards, his livestock, such as chickens, ducks, and lambs, frequently went missing, causing great alarm. Until the other day, a snake catcher passed through his place and knew that there was a snake den outside Zhou's wall. Zhou paid him five yuan. The snake catcher bought medicine and captured over a thousand frogs, storing them in a large jar. He then rubbed the medicine on his arms and whole body, and also took several doses internally. Then, he immersed one arm in the frog jar, taking its liquid, and slowly stretched his arm into the snake den to catch it. After five hours, he pulled the snake's head out of the den, and five people helped to pull the snake's whole body out. It was a red-banded snake, incomparably venomous and long. The snake's abdomen was white, and its body was black with red markings. It had been intoxicated by the medicinal fumes, and was on the verge of death. After it died, the villagers weighed it, and it weighed 142 catties and was about 16 or 17 feet long. The snake catcher packed it in a large hemp bag and left. For a time, the neighbors spread the news, and everyone competed to see it.</p>

<p>Tan Jun, Gao Yongni, Zha Bangyan, Yun Baojun, Shi Rubi, executive committee members of the Wuyi Chamber of Commerce, and Li Cheng and other six supervisory committee members resigned because the Business Tax Bureau recently inspected the accounts of various shops, causing merchants to feel distressed. Oil-printed letters were widely distributed in the market, accusing the executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce of being running dogs of the government. After being circulated and viewed, they were filled with indignation. Since these letters, although anonymous, could not be regarded as the expression of a portion or all of the merchants, they resigned and yielded to the virtuous. They jointly sent a letter to Xu Juxi, acting chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, on the 20th, asking him to resign.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year before last, dozens of bandits robbed Yangshuyuan Town, District Fourteen, in broad daylight, abducted over ten people for ransom, took away all the firearms of the town's water police, and shot and wounded two people.

Nine of the hostages were successively redeemed, but three remained, and because the ransom price was not agreed upon, they were eventually killed in Songjiang this spring. After the fugitives had been pursued by detectives in various places for two years, there was still no progress. The other day, the Songjiang Detective Team arrested a bandit leader named Qian Heshang in Huayang Bridge of that place. According to his confession, he was related to the Yangshuyuan robbery in Changshu. Therefore, the Changshu Detective Team sent four team members to Songjiang to bring him back. He arrived in the county on the 20th. According to his confession, he directly admitted to robbing Yangshuyuan and abducting hostages. The Detective Team is scheduled to hand him over to the county on the 21st.</p>

<p>Since Dong Xiaohou and others applied to Zhejiang University to lease Baima Lake in the western townships of Xiaoshan for raising fresh fish, making it government property, the livelihood of the fishermen of the eighteen villages along the lake has been cut off. Therefore, the fishermen of the lake unanimously oppose it. Last time, a 陈姓 woman, the daughter of fisherman Chen, drowned after being chased by the fish farm's supervisors. The county was immediately notified to examine the body, but the case has not yet been closed. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 19th, several fishermen were fishing along the lake and were shot by the fish farm, killing one person and wounding five others. At that time, more than 380 fishermen were called together to engage in an armed fight with the fish farm. The fish farm hired dozens of people from Datangwu, each holding firearms against the other side. As a result, the poor fishermen had no firearms and dozens were wounded and two were killed. The county was notified to examine the bodies that night. How will this major armed fight case be settled?</p>

<p>Decision for the 25th to fly to Xinjiang. Liu Chongjie's resignation unheard of. Central News Agency reports. Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan passed through Shanghai from Hangzhou last night to go to Beijing. Minister Luo was ordered to inspect Xinjiang. He took a car on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway on the 19th to Hangzhou to take care of personal matters. The next day he went to Mogan Mountain for a short tour. He went down the mountain yesterday morning and returned to Hangzhou, and took the night train to Shanghai last night. Yan Deqing, the president of the National Shanghai Medical College, and many friends of Minister Luo were at the station to welcome him. After Minister Luo got off the train, he immediately changed to the Beijing-Shanghai night train and left Shanghai for Beijing at 11:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Luo's Talk: Minister Luo told a Central News Agency reporter in the train last night that he was scheduled to take a Eurasia Aviation Company northwest passenger plane to Xinjiang on the 25th.

I have never been to Xinjiang before, so I am not sure how long I will stay there. On the way back, I will take a detour to Shaanxi and Gansu. During my inspection, Director Wang will concurrently act as the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As for the rumor that Vice Minister Liu Chongjie had resigned, I have been away from Beijing for three days and have not heard anything.

<p>Describing the tragic situation of being expelled and crossing to the United States, Requesting assistance from all sectors. Mexico's expulsion of our overseas Chinese has been going on for years. The government has negotiated several times but has not been able to curb its ambition. Instead, it has intensified and become more ferocious. Although our domestic people are in deep water and fire, they still have a place to appeal, but overseas Chinese thousands of miles away have no way to cry for help. They only have a piece of paper to express their last breath of hope. The letter from the distressed overseas Chinese in Mexico is excerpted below.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Hiding in the Wilderness <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Mexican politicians arbitrarily show their strength and barbarity, taking advantage of our domestic and foreign troubles and not having time to take care of overseas Chinese. They suddenly implemented anti-Chinese policies and indulged in their bestial nature. At first, they demanded bribes and made some perfunctory gestures, then they rigorously implemented the "90% rejection" rule, allowed the people to rob and loot, and then expelled the overseas Chinese, sealed their shops, and seized their business rights, causing tens of thousands of overseas Chinese to suddenly be displaced and suffering. Various forms of abuse have long been tearfully reported to all parties by various groups and individuals, and are believed to have been understood. At that time, the distressed overseas Chinese were forced to hide in the wilderness due to the burden of their families and the difficulty in raising travel expenses, seeking shelter from other international expatriates. Time passed, and two years passed in an instant.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Escaping Dangerously <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to long-term poverty and annoyance, they appealed to relatives and friends living in Mexico and abroad, asking for help. They gathered funds in various ways and prepared travel expenses. In the middle of this month, they took a train from the city of Shanba, Shan Province, intending to sneak into the United States through Nacari, hoping to be rescued and returned to their home country to live out their remaining years. Unexpectedly, at Nanheke Station in the Shansheng area along the way, eight or nine soldiers forcibly dragged us off the train, claiming that Chinese were not allowed to pass through Shansheng Province. The next morning, they used freight cars to load and drive us out of the Shansheng area. The distressed overseas Chinese were under violence and could not resist, so they had to bow their heads and sleep in the wilderness. Thinking about going forward was impossible, and retreating was nowhere to stay. Therefore, they disregarded death and life, took great risks, and led men and women, walking along the road for nine days and nights, arriving at Moshuyao Port in Shansheng Province.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Enduring Cold and Hunger <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the weak were invaded by mountain winds and miasma, and four of them died one after another. The survivors were also sallow and emaciated, their feet were swollen like pillars, and the cries of children and wives echoed in the road. Seeing this tragic situation, it was difficult to bear. So they wept to the rural areas and sold everything they had, and then they were able to return from Moshuyao Port to Nacari Port. They crossed to the United States on the 22nd, and were detained for medical treatment for two days before they recovered. The US government claims to advocate humanity, although it did not give any abuse, but the food in prison, only a few things of thin porridge and bread for breakfast. It is difficult to satisfy hunger, and it must be extended to 5 pm before eating again. The body that has been looted has suffered from cold and hunger again. The time for begging is unknown, and there is nothing but a body. After a long voyage, the future is vast. If I return to my hometown, I am even more worried about the future.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Request for Relief <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Moreover, among the companions, there are those who are neurologically disordered due to anti-Chinese agitation, there are seventy-year-old men who are dying, there are those who are shuffling and holding crutches. Those who are dying are suffering such a catastrophe. Life is unfortunate, and there is nothing more to add. Forced by hunger and cold, I do not avoid shame and solemnly tell the truth. I implore gentlemen from all over the world to show great compassion and generosity and provide relief to the distressed overseas Chinese when the time comes, then we will feel your great kindness without limit. I am tearful as I write, and I cannot express all my desires. I also hope you will take care of us. The distressed overseas Chinese Chen Guanji, Chen Mingqiu, Zhen Lunzan, Zhen Lunji, Wu Yuzhan, Wu Hongkou, Zhen Quanji, Chen Weilin, Li Junping, Li Jinglin, Li Zhiba, Li Jin, Li Haoxiang, [missing name] Ji, and twenty-two women and children in the Nucari prison in the United States kowtow together.</p>

<p>Pirates were no match and fled in three directions. Zhang Xianyi, the district chief, patrolled the waters off Shengshan and Siqiao outside Wusongkou and discovered a large gang of pirates, numbering about 200, occupying three large Ningbo sailing ships, preying on merchants, kidnapping and extorting ransoms. Zhang Xianyi, the district chief of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team, specially dispatched Wang Yanchen, the captain of the 16th team, Gong Xianqin, the captain of the 17th team, He Yuansheng, the captain of the 18th team, and Hu Dingfen, the captain of the special team, to lead their teams to suppress the pirates.

<p>Liu Hongsheng said he would wait for Minister Song to return home and ask for instructions. Currently, there is no statement to HSBC Bank. Every Monday, the China Merchants Bureau usually has a memorial week report, stating past work and encouraging the future. The attendees were the general manager. After Li Guojie became the general manager, he changed it to the directors of each department acting on his behalf. Yesterday, General Manager Liu Hongsheng specially attended the memorial week to report on important bureau affairs. He informed all the employees of each department and division to attend. At 8:30 a.m., Liu Hongsheng arrived at the auditorium on the second floor of the bureau, and all the staff were present. General Manager Liu Hongsheng saluted the portrait of the late general manager and read the will, and then reported on the recent three important events in the bureau, which are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Adding Ships and Raising Funds <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Liu said that the case of borrowing 400,000 pounds of Boxer Indemnity from the Sino-British to purchase new ships has now been signed. It has been approved to purchase four new seagoing vessels to operate on the South China route, and three Yangtze River vessels will be purchased from the United Kingdom and shipped to Shanghai, where they will be built locally. However, it is estimated that the cost is still insufficient. According to the estimates of the Shipping Department and the New Ship Committee, the cost of these seven vessels is about 8,000 pounds short of the 400,000 pounds of Boxer Indemnity, which is equivalent to 128,000 yuan in national currency. The funds needed to supplement the construction of these Yangtze River vessels must be raised by the bureau itself. It has now been reported to the board of directors, and the bureau will raise additional funds to offset the shortfall.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Santedang Property <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Santedang property at the Jinliyuan Wharf in Nanshi was purchased as bureau property through negotiations by the former director, but the land price was not paid at that time. Only a contract was drawn up as a mortgage. It expired on the 15th of this month. The bureau has repeatedly negotiated with the French Church to renew the mortgage and extend the term, but the church said that the Paris headquarters had not authorized the Shanghai church, so it resolutely refused. Therefore, this amount must be paid off. In addition to the 40,000 taels that have already been paid, about 257,000 yuan still needs to be paid. Since the French Church does not allow the renewal of the mortgage, the bureau has to negotiate with bankers to borrow the money. The results of the negotiations are satisfactory, and this long-standing case can be fundamentally redeemed in a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e103">HSBC Loan <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng also said that the two matters of borrowing money for shipbuilding and redeeming the Santedang property have finally been accomplished. Unexpectedly, the more important case of the HSBC Bank loan has arisen again. It was found that the HSBC loan was made when Fu Xiaoan was the director. The amount was 5 million taels, with five wharves as collateral. It was not repaid when it was due in the past, and it has been extended repeatedly to this day. Including the principal, interest, and additional borrowings, it has reached 7.7 million taels, which is equivalent to more than 10 million yuan in national currency. Now, HSBC suddenly sent a letter to the bureau, urging the performance of the mortgage and redemption of the loan, and indicating that it would no longer be extended. Since the bureau is currently borrowing money for shipbuilding, how can it have this huge amount of 10 million to pay off the creditors? But it cannot be ignored. The importance of the issue is paramount. In addition to reporting this matter to the board of directors for review, we may wait for Minister Song to return home before reporting it for handling. For the time being, there will be no statement. The Naval Department dispatched the Tongji warship, and Ouyang Ge, the captain of the Second Team of the Zhejiang Water Police, dispatched Commander Xu Shidan to assist in the suppression. The two sides fought fiercely for about two hours. The pirates were unable to resist. A group of pirates led by Xiang fled to the waters of Wentai. A group led by Li Guanwu fled to Huaihai and other places. Another group of pirates fled to the waters off Sheshan, and was severely attacked and repelled by Lu Gongren, the captain of the Ce Dian cruiser stationed there. They fled to Caozhuang in Ganyu, abandoned their boats and landed, and were intercepted by the police team stationed there. Yesterday, Director Zhang took a cruiser to inspect the ports and waters of Shengshan and Siqiao and ordered all the teams under his jurisdiction to strengthen defenses and prevent pirates from entering the country in order to maintain navigation.</p>

<p>The People are So Poor: The National Credit is Like That. The Shanghai County Local Wealth Management Office and others sent a quick mail telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Government, which said, "In previous years, an additional two yuan has been levied with the winter grain tax, and the people have appealed for exemption. The Ministry has approved an extension of one year, and it will not be continued. The province has approved that the case has been approved and should not be discussed." Now it is heard that when the winter grain tax is levied this year, there is also a proposal to levy an additional two yuan per stone, which has caused panic among the people, who all say that the people are so poor and the national credit is like that, year after year, it is an inexhaustible treasury. In recent years, the rural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy, and scholars and officials from the government and the public are thinking about relief, and they also know that the people's livelihood is haggard and the foundation of the country is at stake. Those who are planning for the long-term interests of the country are taking the time to reduce taxes, let alone increase them. Moreover, this year's weather has been bad, and although it is not yet possible to predict whether it will be a bumper or lean year, the expenses of farmers and workers are already insufficient. This county has already cleared the land and collected the fees, and the grain tax is ordered to be limited. The people's resources are limited, and the endless demands are made, even ignoring the clear order of not exceeding 100 taxes per tax. Draining the pond to catch all the fish is unbearable for the people. The chairman is also a native of Jiangsu, and the people of Jiangnan have suffered from heavy taxes for a long time. The subordinates are under strict supervision from the elders, and they are anxious from morning to night, and it is difficult to sleep and eat. They know that the Ministry and the government hold the pain of injury, and they will never bear to add even the slightest burden to the remaining lives. Even if there are ministers who offer advice, they will surely silently eliminate it. However, in the midst of the people's panic, rumors are occasionally spread, and they tell each other in horror. As far as their eyes and ears can reach, they dare not block it from the upper levels. They should send a telegram to appeal and ask for mercy for the difficulties of the people and approve the cancellation of the proposal to increase the winter grain tax in order to maintain national credit and comfort the people.

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods notified Jia Jing Xin Sheng Society that the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods, such as Gongzu Sock Factory, Yingzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, etc., privately purchased Lama brand raw cotton from Dakang Textile Factory, changed it to Ren Zhong brand from Shenxin Fifth Factory, wove it into goods, and transported it to the market, passing it off as domestic goods in order to seek huge profits. Their actions were deceiving the public and undermining the domestic goods movement. The committee has decided to notify all members to refuse to purchase the products of these factories, and to send letters to the guilds of the knitting and cotton cloth industries to give them severe and effective punishment, and to send letters to the grocery industry guild and the First and Second Special Zone Citizens' Union to notify all stores in the city to pay attention to the products of these factories and refuse to promote them, so as to warn unscrupulous merchants. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e106">Original Notice <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>(Omitted above) It was found that the newspapers of the 15th of this month published that Gongwa Sock Factory, Yingzhou, Dingxin, Junchang, Tonghe Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Sanyang, Jiuyi, Yukang Cotton Weaving Factory, Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, Yixinghao, and ten other companies privately purchased Lama brand raw cotton from Dakang Textile Factory, changed it to Ren Zhong brand from Shenxin Fifth Factory, wove it into goods, and transported it to various ports. The Su-Zhe-Wan District Unified Tax Bureau has discovered the conspiracy and filed a lawsuit. It was found that these factories have lost their conscience and are greedy for profit. Such behavior is not only deceiving the public but also undermining the domestic goods movement. Our association is responsible and cannot remain silent. The 13th session of the 10th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees has decided to notify all members to refuse to trade with these factories, and to send letters to the guilds of the knitting and cotton cloth industries to give them the most severe and effective punishment, and to send letters to the grocery industry guild and the First and Second Special Zone Citizens' Union to notify all stores in the city to pay close attention to the products of these ten factories and refuse to promote them in order to warn unscrupulous merchants and maintain commercial reputation. The record is on file. In addition to notifying all members, we will send separate letters to inform you accordingly. I hope your association will take note of this and handle it, and I look forward to a reply. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>Also, Gongzu and other factories sent a letter to the association yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, we were surprised to read in the newspaper that your association has decided to notify the Citizens' Union of the First and Second Special Zones to inform all stores to refuse to use and crack down on the products of our factories. We have always purchased cotton yarn raw materials through brokers, and the tax bills are also attached to the goods. Our factories have no way of knowing whether they are genuine or fake. Later, the tax bureau discovered the alterations, and the responsibility should be borne by the handling broker. The procedures and books are not difficult to review. Moreover, the handling broker has also been detained. The truth will soon be revealed. The newspapers have misunderstood the facts and mistakenly pointed out that our factories made the alterations. Our factories have already applied to the guild of this industry to select staff to thoroughly investigate. Before the association has verified the matter, we are unwilling to make too many defenses. We hope that your association will not listen to one-sided statements and believe them, and decide to warn, so that the group that loves domestic goods will turn into an obstacle to the development of domestic goods. That would be fortunate. Sincerely, Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods, Gongzu, Dingxin, Yingzhou, Tonghe, Jiuyi, Yukang, Junchang, Sanyang, and other factories."</p>

<p>The East China National Salvation Army Enquires. The representative of the East China People's Alliance for National Salvation, stationed in Shanghai, received a communication from the headquarters, stating that Wei Minggao, a representative of General Ma Zhanshan, came to the headquarters to contact them and donated 2,000 yuan to comfort the wounded soldiers and about 2,000 yuan worth of pigs, cattle, wine, and noodles to reward the soldiers, totaling 4,000 yuan. I thought that Ma had just returned to the country and sent someone to contact them, which might be possible, but he might not bring such a large amount of money to comfort them. Therefore, there are many doubts. It is feared that he is a detective. He has now been placed under house arrest at the headquarters. Please inquire about the truth from Ma's headquarters nearby. A special person will send a letter to inform you for handling.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 1:10 pm, a solar eclipse began. It ended at 2:50 pm. However, it was only a partial eclipse, so the sunlight was still strong and there was no dim atmosphere. Because the citizens saw in the newspapers that the solar eclipse was in the middle of the day and the weather was clear yesterday, many people looked up, but many people could not see it because their eyes could not withstand the strong sunlight. The reporter looked up at the sun at 1:45 pm. At first, it was difficult to bear the dazzling light, but he still stared at it for a long time. Then he saw the lower end of the sun as if a piece of baked cake had been bitten off. In the end, he could not see much with his naked eyes. He closed his eyes and sat quietly to recover his eyesight. According to Dabaisha, the editor of scientific knowledge said that yesterday was only a partial eclipse. The total eclipse will have to wait until September 21, 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China), and only the central part of China will be able to see it. The rest of the provinces will only see it as a partial eclipse.</p>

<p>Arrangements for Ma's Troops Have Been Made. He Will Go to Mogan Mountain This Morning to Visit Ma and Report Back. General Ma Zhanshan sent Wu Huanzhang as his representative to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang, report on his difficulties in resigning from the Military Commission, and ask for instructions on how to make arrangements for his troops. Wu completed his official business in Beijing yesterday morning and returned to Shanghai.

<p>According to Wu, the only task of this trip to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang was to represent General Ma in reporting his difficulties in resigning from the Military Commission and to ask for instructions on how to make arrangements for his troops. He also carried a personal letter from General Ma, which he presented to Chairman Chiang. In addition, he offered two suggestions to Chairman Chiang as a private individual and a party member: one was to retain talents for the country, and the other was to maintain the people's hearts for the party. Chairman Chiang understood General Ma's difficulties in resigning from the Military Commission, but still hoped that General Ma would cancel his resignation and take office as soon as possible. He instructed that a roster of Ma's civil and military officials be made first and then submitted to the central government for placement. As for General Ma's old troops, he agreed to reorganize them. Chairman Chiang also agreed to personally donate some money to help the families of the generals.</p>

General Li had a minor illness before, but he has now recovered. He is scheduled to leave Lushan for Shanghai within a few days, and then go to Xinjiang. However, when I left Lushan, General Li was not yet ready to depart. When I was staying in Lushan, bad news came that Commander Deng Wen was killed in Zhangjiakou. When I visited Chairman Chiang, I reported to Chairman Chiang about the incident of Commander Deng's death. Chairman Chiang agreed to transfer the request to the central government for generous compensation.</p>

<p>Requesting Assistance from All Circles in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter yesterday from Zhang Zhendong, a representative of the General Command of the Hua Dong People's National Salvation Army Allied Forces. The letter stated, "Zhendong was entrusted with a secret order from our General Commander Zhang this time, risking his life from the Jilin border to come here and request assistance from your association. He has personally presented the situation of our army's resistance against Japan and suppression of traitors, and has been understood and is awaiting orders. Our department has also dispatched Wang Lizhong, who brought with him a report of our army's victory in a major battle against the Japanese and puppet troops on July 22. We will now briefly present it to you all: The Japanese, because we have a formal organization, have repeatedly tried to destroy it. On July 22, they launched a large-scale attack on three routes. The first route attacked Baoqing, with a force of over 3,000, including over 600 Japanese soldiers and over 2,500 puppet troops, supported by three fighter planes. The second and third routes jointly attacked Boli, with a force of over 3,000 Japanese and puppet troops. General Commander Zhang personally led 8,000 elite troops to defend against the first route on the banks of the Qixing River, engaging in hand-to-hand combat for two days and nights, shooting down one plane. The enemy is now in disarray and retreating. Three battalions of puppet troops defected and revolted, killing Japanese soldiers in the chaos, causing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers to drown while desperately trying to escape. Only a dozen or so survived. Our army also suffered heavy casualties. We captured a large amount of Japanese weaponry, including the weaponry brought by the three defected battalions, not counting those, we obtained eighteen Type 74 field guns, sixteen mountain guns, more than ten machine guns, 362 rifles, 600,000 rounds of ammunition, 631 shells, seventeen cargo trucks, and thirty-eight large horse-drawn carts, all fully loaded with military supplies. However, the large carts were requisitioned from civilians by the enemy and have been returned to their original owners. The second route was defended by our Ru Youcai's army at Xinqiantun, and the third route was defended by our Chen Zongdai's army at Tuoyaozi Mountain, both of which were repelled by our army. As for the detailed battle situation, due to traffic blockades, we have not yet received a formal report, so we cannot describe it. The Japanese army, after suffering a major defeat, is urgently planning to attack again, and we are preparing countermeasures to resist. The reason why our army was victorious this time was because we had a slightly sufficient supply of bullets. The soldiers were confident and determined to kill the enemy, so the Japanese repeatedly attacked but failed to succeed. If Shanghai once again advocates for support, and the support arrives, the morale will be even more boosted, and the expulsion of the Japanese invaders and the recovery of lost territory will be just around the corner. If everyone holds a mentality of seeking temporary peace and ignores the patriotic heroes fighting desperately on the battlefield, then we can only do our best and, unable to form Shao Kang's army, are willing to emulate Tian Heng's five hundred followers. We believe that our countrymen are not lacking in understanding and will certainly not become slaves of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, we repeatedly appeal and hope for your generous advice so that we may follow it."</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Hunan Provincial National Products Exhibition Hall, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding your letter of the 19th of this month, inquiring whether the Seven Roses brand satin cloth produced by the British firm Lun Chang Company is an imported product or a domestic product, which is difficult to identify, and requesting a reply after investigation, we have investigated the definition of foreign goods, which has two types: one is manufactured overseas and sold to China, and the other is manufactured in China by foreign capital based on the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Lun Chang is a British capital firm that manufactures in China, and of course belongs to the scope of foreign goods. Moreover, the outer packaging of the factory's products also has the words "British Lun Chang Factory," leaving no room for doubt.</p>

<p>Japan prohibits Chinese workers from entering the country and also excludes Chinese who were originally doing business in the Orient, not allowing them to stay in Japan or engage in commerce. Recently, in Tokyo and Osaka, there have been dozens of people who sold groceries, worked in oil factories, and ran restaurants, who were prohibited from staying in Japan by the Japanese police authorities, forced onto ships, and expelled back to China. More than ten people, including Wu Yanyuan, Chen Yelang, Xu Zhulin, Du Zhongfu, Liu Yaotang, Ni Shengqi, and Lin Guohua, have arrived in Shanghai on the Rokko Maru. When these overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai, they had no luggage and were in an extremely wretched state. It is said that there are still dozens of people who will also be expelled back to China. It is also said that there is no place for Chinese to stand in Japan anymore. The overseas Chinese merchants who arrived in Shanghai will now be sent back to their hometowns.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Yuan, this time he went to Beijing to request instructions on the collection of fisheries construction fees and fisheries construction matters. He did not meet the Minister because he was in Qingdao. He met and discussed with Xu Tinghu, Director of the Agricultural Department. It is said that the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve fisheries, is now planning to jointly establish a fishing ground with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Once Minister Chen Gongbo returns to Shanghai, he can proceed with planning with Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The specific measures can be determined in February.</p>

<p>The Sichuan Northwest Famine Relief Petition Group, the Sichuan Fellow Association, and the Sichuan Tongnanba Fellow Association in Shanghai invited leaders of Sichuan origin in Shanghai yesterday to discuss the practical measures to help the more than 2 million refugees from more than ten counties in northern Sichuan. Yang Shukan, Huang Fusheng, Gu Ao, Tan Yigong, Li Baibei, Wu Shan, Xia Lianggong, Lai Xinhui, Fan Chongshi, Liu Yuchuan, Song Yuqi, Li Jingyu, Yang Suichu, Shao Jigao, Li Xunfu, Huang Fogong, and other 30 people attended. First, the representatives of the petition group, Liu Zihe, Bao Heng, and Li Shenpei, reported in detail on the situation of the famine in northern Sichuan and the plight of the refugees fleeing and waiting for relief, as well as the process of petitioning the central party, government, and military authorities in Lushan and Nanjing, and their wishes for this trip to Shanghai. Then, Zhong Hangsu and Qiu Zhizhong, representatives of the Rotary Shanghai Fellow Association, reported that after receiving telegrams from Pan Wenhua, Chairman of the Chongqing Relief Committee, and representatives of the petition group, describing the disaster situation, they immediately decided on seven relief measures, six of which have now been implemented by the document department. Finally, Li Qingfan, a representative of the Tongnanba Fellow Association, reported on the previous petition to Beijing and the proposed fundraising process. After the reports of the various groups, Yang Shukan first expressed detailed and specific opinions, followed by Li Boshen, Gu Ao, Xia Lianggong, Tan Yigong, Lai Xinhui, and others, who expressed their opinions. As a result, it was decided that: 1. Yang Shukan and others of the Sichuan Central Committee in Shanghai would send a telegram to the central government, the Executive Yuan, and the Relief Committee to report the disaster situation and request a large amount of funds to provide relief to the refugees. 2. A telegram would be sent to Liu Xiang, the Sichuan Rehabilitation Governor, and the provincial government, requesting them to quickly prepare a large amount of funds to handle emergency relief.

<h3 id="e128">Correction of Responsible Joint Transport Fee <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways ordered the Railway Bureau to comply with the instructions issued yesterday by the Ministry of Railways, stating:</p>
<p>"It has been found that the responsible fee charged for responsible transportation should be 10% of the ordinary or special freight rate. For priority shipment, 30% should be added to the responsible freight rate. For the highest priority shipment, 60% should be added to the responsible freight rate. These are regulations in the General Rules and should not be arbitrarily increased or decreased. However, it has been found that the various railways have recently been charging the responsible fee for discounted goods that should be transported under the responsible transportation regulations according to their un-discounted ordinary freight rates, resulting in the responsible fee for these discounted goods exceeding the discount that should be added to the freight rate. This not only makes accounting difficult but also violates the provisions of the General Rules. In the future, when the railway charges the responsible fee for discounted goods that are eligible for responsible transportation, it should be calculated based on the freight rate after the discount, and should not be calculated based on the freight rate before the discount, in order to comply with the regulations. Please comply strictly with this order."</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Investigation Committee Replies to Pan Xulun <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>After doubts arose about the amount of donations to support the Northeast Volunteer Army, various circles organized a Committee for the Investigation of National Salvation Donations. There were rumors that the total amount of donations was no less than 20 to 30 million yuan. Accountant Pan Xulun paid close attention to the source of these rumors and sent a letter to the committee to inquire. Yesterday, the committee replied to Accountant Pan, stating:</p>
<p>"Mr. Xulun,</p>
<p>Regarding your letter of August 16, we respectfully acknowledge receipt. We understand that you inquired about the basis for the statement 'The total amount of donations from various ports at home and abroad to support the Northeast Volunteer Army should be no less than 20 to 30 million yuan.' This shows that you are paying close attention to the source and destination of the donations, and we deeply admire this. The basis for this statement is taken from newspaper advertisements and street discussions, but even an empty valley will echo a sound, so how can we know that there is no cause? Moreover, the transmission of rumors is originally one of the true public opinions of the people. Compared to the deceptive talk of so-called celebrities, how can they be equated? Therefore, taking it as evidence is not harmful. Moreover, the current issue is not about where the 20 to 30 million yuan came from, but whether there is any embezzlement, theft, or corruption of the donations. The purpose of the investigation is simply to investigate whether there is any malpractice in the donations. If there is malpractice, then greedy and lawless people cannot be allowed to roam free outside the law. If there is no malpractice, then those who are public-spirited, clean, and self-loving will be all the more clearly vindicated. Rumors and slanders cannot detract from their reputation in the slightest. Therefore, all fundraising organizations and individuals, if they believe that there is no malpractice as rumored, then they should open their doors at midnight and not be alarmed. They can present all their accounts and receipts one by one to dispel public doubts. This is what we have been hoping for day and night. At that time, our association would have no need to investigate, and the rumors and street discussions would be dispelled without being attacked. They will not be able to stir up social attention as they do today. Now, instead of focusing on this, they are focusing on the source of the 20 to 30 million yuan, which is putting the cart before the horse and making people greatly confused. Furthermore, the so-called 20 to 30 million yuan transmitted by street discussions, before the fundraisers have disproved this statement with facts, this suspected case will remain a pending case. Who can criticize taking it as evidence for reference? In short, the rise of the donation investigation movement is purely in response to public opinion and the suspicion of social benefactors about the receipt and expenditure of donations. If the fundraisers want to express their sincerity and integrity, openness and honesty, then there is no other way than to clearly and publicly announce their receipts, account books, and receipts of donations, and accept our association's investigation in a fair and impartial manner. To say that relying solely on clever words and the four words "so-called celebrities" can cover the ears of the world and block the mouths of millions of people is truly a foolish dream and should be stopped. There is still something that our association cannot help but say. Since you are one of the supervisory committee members of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and it is said that you are the one who keeps and audits the accounts of this organization, then your knowledge of the situation is more detailed and accurate than that of outsiders. Now that you criticize the rumors transmitted by street discussions as not worth taking, then why not tell us the reliable information that you know so that we can correct them and clarify right and wrong? This is something that our association cannot help but regret. If you say that you do not know everything, then we do not know what you are relying on to accuse us and criticize the street discussions as untrustworthy. Are you not being too harsh on our association and too lenient on others? Otherwise, you must know but deliberately not declare, so is your intention worthy of questioning? You will surely be held accountable for these two things. You are old and may not be clear about the dark secrets of the outside world, but your learning, morality, reputation, and personality have long been admired and noticed by the people of society. We hope that you will cherish yourself, adhere to 'doing things with conscience, not being confused by clever words and temptations, and not being a tool of demons and monsters, and working as a servant for tigers.' Then, not only will you personally gain the way to protect yourself wisely and end your reputation, but it will also be the fortune of social credit and the future of the nation. Our association adheres to the meaning of loving people with virtue and has high expectations for you, so we are not lenient in our words. Whether you know that we are guilty or know that we are right is up to you to think deeply and carefully, and to work together to save some face for the nation and the country. As we come to the end, our thoughts are racing and we cannot express all that we want to say. We only wish you good health.</p>

<p>Shanghai Allocates 2,000 Yuan to be Transferred to Pingji</p>
<p>This time, the Yellow River breached and flowed into its old course, and the water势 was rapid. People, livestock, and houses were washed away. The water level in Shandong Province is still rising. It is reported that the Red Swastika Society General Headquarters and the Jinan Red Swastika Society Branch have sent telegrams to Shanghai for emergency help. The original telegrams are recorded as follows: 1. Shanghai General Office, the Yellow River has breached and the disaster affects several provinces. Hua Pin and others have been sent to urgently provide relief. Please provide assistance quickly to save the people. The General Headquarters bows, efficiency. 1. Shanghai General Office, the Yellow River has breached and Yu Fuhe has led a team of workers and staff, carrying 2,000 yuan of relief funds and 2,000 doses of medicine to provide relief. Please quickly send a letter to the various associations to assist and request that personnel be sent to handle it together. The Ji Society bows, skill.</p>
<p>After receiving the telegrams, the office immediately convened a temporary meeting and immediately raised 2,000 yuan for relief funds, which were remitted to Pingji on the same day, and sent a telegram to the branches in the southeastern provinces to raise funds and assist in the relief. However, the disaster area is large and there are many disaster victims. We deeply hope that the major benefactors at home and abroad will rise up to rescue and generously contribute to save the people.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Dispute Between Merchants and Vendors on Jiangyin Street <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Charity Group Replies to Representatives of Vendors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Group replied to a letter from representatives of merchants and vendors on Jiangyin Street, stating:</p>
<p>"We are pleased to inform you that our group believes that the number of residents in the Lujiabang area has increased, and the Jiangyin Street vegetable market is increasingly crowded. In addition, standing in the open air, exposed to rain and sun, is inconvenient for both buyers and sellers. Therefore, we have demarcated three mu of land at the corner of Lujiabang Railway Station Road to build a vegetable market, containing 480 vegetable stalls. We first submitted a report to the Finance Bureau on December 16 of last year and obtained approval. The report and sketches were all understood. The bureau has submitted it to the 22nd standing meeting of the Vegetable Market Construction Committee, and approved the construction, requesting that detailed drawings be drawn and submitted to the Public Works Bureau to apply for a construction license and build it as soon as possible. This approval and drawings are kept on file. In May of this year, we advertised for bids for construction work. We reported to the Social Bureau and on the 15th, the Social Bureau sent personnel to supervise the opening of bids. On July 2nd, representatives of merchants and vendors on Jiangyin Street, including Du Jinbao, requested the cessation of the vegetable market construction. Our group sent a letter to the representatives, instructing them to request consideration from the authorities, and copied the original text to the Social Bureau for review. On July 17th, we received an approval from the Social Bureau, and the reports and copies were all understood, instructing us to still comply with the regulations and the group's original plan for the vegetable market construction. This approval and copies are kept on file. The representatives came to the group on the 11th and reiterated their previous request. Our group immediately copied the original letter and submitted it to the Finance Bureau for instructions. On July 26th, we received an approval from the Finance Bureau, and the reports and copies were all understood, stating that the bureau had decided to convene the 24th standing meeting of the Vegetable Market Construction Committee at 2:00 pm on the 31st of this month, and in addition to sending letters to the committee members to send personnel to attend, the group was requested to send responsible representatives to the bureau to attend the meeting. This approval and documents are kept on file. Our group sent staff member Ye Zhenquan to attend the meeting and stated the circumstances. On August 10th, several people claiming to be representatives of vendors on Jiangyin Street went to the home of Huang Xingjie, a director of our group, requesting the cancellation of the vegetable market construction on Railway Station Road. At 10:00 am on the 15th, representatives, including Du Jinbao, a hundred and seventy or eighty people, went to our group's office, asking our group to publicly agree to cancel the vegetable market. Our group agreed to reply after the board of directors deliberated. Unexpectedly, the representatives relied on the crowd and persisted. Later, members of the Public Security Bureau and the Social Bureau came to the group to mediate before they dispersed. On the 20th, our group's board of directors held a temporary meeting and decided that the matter concerned local public welfare and had been approved by the authorities. It was impossible to change it without authorization, and there was no reason to submit a request to the authorities to change the previous case. A letter should be sent to the representatives. Therefore, we have recorded the case for your review. In order to maintain the livelihood of the old stalls, our group allows them to bring the Finance Bureau's donation license to our group for registration. As of August 20th, 363 old stalls have been registered. The representatives who have registered include Du Jin, one for selling fish and one for selling vegetables, another new vegetable stall, Fan Gongliang's meat stall, Xu Chunhua's vegetable stall, Ling Heming's salt stall, Xie Liansheng's fish stall, and Yan Hongxiang's father, Wenyuan's, three fish stalls. Since the representatives used the name of maintaining the old stalls on Jiangyin Street to mobilize the public, there is no reason for them to register first. It is clear that others are impersonating them, and it should not be valid. However, fearing that the representatives are being used by others and blindly following, our group is giving them extra consideration and temporarily reserving their registration. If they can come to the group and declare repentance, they will be treated the same as other registered stallholders. Furthermore, our group will never charge rent beyond the prices stipulated by the authorities in the future. Please do not worry and please notify them on our behalf.</p>
<p>Addressed to all merchants and vendors on Jiangyin Street,</p>
<p>From the Shanghai Charity Group,</p>

The first prize number was 226622, which was claimed by Zhu Wenjiang, a Chinese detective from the General Inspectorate, for 5,000 yuan.  Li Dongtao also held a first prize ticket, but was unable to redeem the prize money, so he hired a lawyer to file a fraud lawsuit against Li Xuedong, the manager of the Huadong Tobacco Company. The First Special District Court held a hearing, and the defendant hired Wu Linkun and Chen Zhongyin as lawyers to defend him. The arguments have been completed and reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the judgment. The plaintiff's side did not arrive. The defendant still appeared in court with lawyers Wu and Chen.  Judge Huang Risheng took the stand and announced the verdict: Li Xuedong was found not guilty. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court for trial.</p>

<p>Eight Suicides :: Two Run Over by Vehicles</p>
<p>Six Women :: Four Men</p>
<p>Guo Wei, Prosecutor of the First Special District District Court Procuratorate, took a car to Feilun Road yesterday morning to examine the bodies of men and women, totaling ten.</p>
<p>The causes of death are described as follows: (1) Duan Liu, a 47-year-old woman from Henan Province. Her husband, Duan Yuqiao, works as a chef at the Liangyuan Restaurant on Guangxi Road. They live at No. 145 Zhangjiazhai, Aiwenyi Road. The other day, she had a quarrel with her cohabiting woman, Li Ni, over trivial matters.  She thought about it and became resentful, and developed a sense of despair. She hanged herself alone in the bedroom. Her husband reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detectives to take the body to the mortuary. (2) Gong Zhaodi, a 28-year-old woman, unmarried, lives at No. 792 Hartung Road. The other day, her grandmother, Gong Gu, slightly blamed her granddaughter for not bathing for five or six days. Unexpectedly, the woman felt resentful after being blamed and secretly took rat poison and committed suicide by swallowing it. Her mother, Gong Zhang, noticed it, but it was too late to save her. She died soon after. The Jing'an Temple Police Station also received a report and ordered detectives to take the body to the mortuary. (3) Kong Fanwu, a 27-year-old man from Yangzhou, originally lived at No. 1, Lane 6, Xiaoshadu Road. Recently, he has been unemployed at home, which has led to exceptional economic difficulties. He has been in arrears with his rent for many months. Later, the landlord sued him in court, sealed up the house, and drove Kong out. As a result, he felt that life was not worth living and committed suicide by swallowing opium in the alley the other day. The police found him and sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he died soon after. The Gordon Road Police Station ordered detectives to take the body to the mortuary. (4) Liu Zhao, a 33-year-old woman from Shandong Province. Her husband, Liu Zaisheng, is a laborer. They live together at No. 395 Xihua Road. A few days ago, she had a quarrel with her husband because he had an affair. Unexpectedly, her husband refused to admit it and beat her instead. As a result, she thought about it and became resentful the other day and developed a sense of despair. She hanged herself in her bedroom without anyone knowing. Her aunt, Liu Wang, noticed it and immediately reported to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detectives to take the body to the mortuary. (5) Ni Wang, a local woman, 18 years old, lives with Ni Huahua, the uncle of her husband, Ni Zhaoxiang, at the Zenghe Rice Shop, No. 253 Dongjiaxing Road. Her husband, Ni Zhaoxiang, works in a certain factory, so he is not often at home. She is naturally romantic and has recently been having an affair with Shao Wenjun. A few days ago, her uncle discovered the truth and slightly blamed her, causing a quarrel. Later, she felt ashamed and resentful, and secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Someone reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to take her by car to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died soon after. The body was taken to the mortuary. (6) Zhang Anian, a prisoner from Pudong, 35 years old, in the West Prison on Huade Road. He had previously committed a theft and was arrested by the Putuo Road Police Station, sent to the court, and sentenced to two years imprisonment. He has been serving his sentence for more than a year. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM the other day, while the prisoner was having lunch, for some reason, he inserted a bamboo chopstick into his nostril, causing serious injury at the time. The guard caught a glimpse of it and sent him to the police hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died soon after. The body was taken to the mortuary. (7) Peng Youcai, a thief formerly arrested by the Xinzha Police Station, 12 years old, was sent to the court and sentenced to imprisonment. He is currently serving his sentence in the Huade Road Prison. Unexpectedly, the other day, Peng suddenly felt that life was not worth living and hanged himself with a washcloth on the iron fence. The guard caught a glimpse of it and immediately reported it to the warden, who ordered someone to take the body to the mortuary. (8) Lu, a Ningbo woman, 17 years old. Her husband, Yu Jinyuan, works as an apprentice on a certain ship, earning very little. Therefore, she is temporarily living at her friend's place at No. 574 Yuanfang Road. The other day, she did not know what stimulated her, but she suddenly felt that life was not worth living and secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Someone caught a glimpse of it, but it was too late to save her. She died soon after. The Hongkou Police Station received a report and ordered detectives to take the body to the mortuary. (9) Chen Guixiang, a local person, 49 years old, lives in Chenjia Lane, Qiubiao Road, and makes a living by growing vegetables. At about 8:00 PM the other night, Chen was walking along Qiubiao Road, intending to cross the road from south to north. Unexpectedly, at this time, an American, Weina Mushi, who works at the Shanghai Waterworks Company, was driving his own car with the license plate number 8079 from west to east, speeding past Chen. He was unable to brake in time and ran her over, causing serious injuries. The Jing'an Temple Police Station learned of this and ordered detectives to take her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died soon after. The body was taken to the mortuary on Feilun Road. (10) Xi Yuandi, a 7-year-old girl, was at Tangen Road on Jia Road the other day, going from north to south. Unexpectedly, at that time, Wei Agen, the driver of a sanitation department vehicle with the license plate number 16429, was driving from east to west, and he was unable to avoid her in time. He ran the child over, causing serious injuries. The Jiaxing Police Station ordered detectives to take her to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died soon after. The body was taken to the mortuary. Prosecutor Guo examined each body and instructed the families of each body to sign a guarantee and take it back for coffin burial. If there was no family, he ordered it to be handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Over One Hundred Shops on North Sichuan Road Request Postponement of House Tax Collection Again <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Using House Tax from This Autumn to Next Spring</p>
<p>as Funds to Relieve War-Torn Areas and Revitalize the Market</p>
<p>(Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Municipal Authorities have decided to start collecting house tax on North Sichuan Road yesterday, but shops there are still appealing for a postponement. Here is the petition to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council jointly signed by Yifeng and 195 other shops:</p>
<p>Petition for Commercial Decline, Deepening Losses, Urgent Request to Postpone the Collection of House Tax Again to Maintain Commercial Hardship. We, the undersigned, submit that North Sichuan Road, as a road built beyond the concession, has suffered losses from war disasters, its vitality has been almost completely lost, and the market has been sluggish. Although we have endured pain to resume business, we have been losing money for more than a year, and the situation has become increasingly dire. Many have closed down, and we have repeatedly appealed for the postponement of the collection of house tax for several months, but no instructions have been received. Recently, we received a notice from the Finance Bureau stating that the house tax on North Sichuan Road is exempted for the summer and will be collected in the autumn. We are deeply frightened by this order. We have repeatedly explained the difficulties of the merchants regarding the house tax and requested that the collection be postponed until the market recovers slightly and the people's difficulties are alleviated, at which time we will pay the tax. We have detailed this in previous submissions. However, we believe that the municipal treasury is facing extraordinary deficits, and the general tax is an obligation that citizens should bear. How dare we continue to seek exemption? However, we merchants have been frugally trying to make ends meet since suffering from the war disaster. The disaster relief records for the entire district can be presented as evidence, and this is not an empty statement. At this time of lacking the magic touch to turn things into gold, and facing such dire straits, it is really impossible to crawl and rush to our deaths. We previously received a letter from the General Federation of Citizens stating that they would not send personnel to collect taxes again in the area beyond the concession until the issue is resolved. The original letter can be copied for your review. Now, after the merchants have gathered to discuss the matter, and after repeated exhortations from the Executive Committee members of the Municipal Council and the 25 District Associations, we have unanimously decided to request that the house tax from this autumn to next spring be used by our Municipal Government as funds to relieve the war-torn areas and exempt from collection to help revitalize the market. The regular collection after the summer will be the same. Citizens can gain real benefits, and our Municipal Government can fulfill its relief responsibilities to some extent. This will benefit both the government and the disaster situation. We hope that you will understand and approve. (The following is omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e143">Dismissed Postman Conspires with Friend to Steal Letters from Mailboxes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Tearing off the Stamps on the Letters for Profit</p>
<p>The Key Was Purchased from a Used Goods Stall</p>
<p>The Postal Bureau Dispatched Investigators to Investigate and Arrest</p>
<p>Kang Dingji, a local person residing at No. 36 Jiangyuan Lane in the South City, was formerly a postman with the number 620 at the post office. He was dismissed for some reason in August last year and has been unemployed ever since. Because he could not support his livelihood, he willingly committed crimes and conspired with his friend Wang Gengsheng from Ningbo to privately open the post office mailboxes placed on the side of the road at the intersection of Chongqing Road and Weihai Road, steal letters, and tear off the stamps on the letters to sell for profit. This kind of theft was not easily detected by the post office and was not easy to solve. Now, some senders feel that the letters they send are not received by the recipients and suspect that the post office is at fault. They have written to the Postmaster General to inquire, which has aroused the attention of the postal authorities. The bureau specially dispatched investigators Zhong Chaojun and Dai Qinglan to be responsible for the investigation. They knew that this malpractice was occurring at the mailboxes on the streets, so they went to various roads to investigate. At 8:45 PM the other night, they were investigating at the intersection of Chongqing Road and Weihai Road when they saw Wang Gengsheng opening the mailbox there. Zhong et al. saw him steal a letter from the mailbox and put it into his bag. He immediately ran away. They immediately shouted for his arrest and arrested him at the Zhabei Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, Wang confessed that Kang Dingji had instructed him to steal, and the police chief immediately sent detectives Su Yinggen and Ye Yushan, and Western Detective Chief Mo Hao, to arrest Kang. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District District Court, where Judge Wu Xiangzu conducted a preliminary hearing. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case and requested that the two defendants be punished for theft. Kang Dingji confessed that he could not find a job because he was unemployed, so he bought a key from a used goods stall and gave it to Wang to open the boxes and steal. However, the stolen mail could not be sold, so he had not done anything. Wang Gengsheng confessed that he was foolishly influenced by Kang to do this, and that the key had been discarded when he was arrested. Chinese and Western detectives also presented a stolen letter found on Wang, 36 letters found at Kang's home, and a number of stamps and photos attached to the letters to Judge Wu for review. Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Changes in the Oil Sales Cooperation of British, American, and Russian Oil Companies in China Again <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>British and American Oil Prices Drop, Guanghua Intends to Compete Again</p>
<p>Consulted with Russian Oil Everywhere Last Night on Methods</p>
<p>(French News Agency)</p>
<p>Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco have recently been competing fiercely with the Guanghua Russian Oil and have been selling at a low price. The Russian Oil Everywhere Company products rely on their state-owned and domestic advantages and do not hesitate to depreciate prices to compete. For half a year, other British and American oil merchants have been greatly affected. In July, Mobil and the other three companies originally intended to join hands with Guanghua and no longer make unnecessary sacrifices in business. These four major oil companies each accounted for one share and were promoted equally. The Guanghua Oil Company, which distributes the Russian Oil Everywhere, has also obtained the tacit approval of the Russian Oil Everywhere Company, and it seems that there is a trend of moving towards the same goal. Therefore, in the recent month, the four major oil companies have uniformly priced gasoline at 80 cents, regardless of the high or low price. However, there was a change within the company yesterday. Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco were originally on the same line, but yesterday Asiatic suddenly dropped the price of gasoline by 5 cents per gallon to 75 cents. Therefore, Guanghua felt that these oil merchants had abandoned the cooperation. Although the price was still 80 cents yesterday, it is expected that the price will also have to be lowered in the short term to greatly compete. Yesterday afternoon, reporters went to Guanghua to inquire. According to the staff of the gasoline department of the company, the current price of gasoline for our company is 80 cents, and the actual price is 68 cents, which is actually cheaper than British and American oil. Kerosene is 5 yuan and 70 cents per box. The sudden depreciation of the British and American oil companies today is due to internal changes in their companies. However, although our company is still marking the price of yesterday (the day before yesterday) at 80 cents today, it may also lower the price to compete with it. This matter is related to the market and is difficult to tell you in advance. At present, the gasoline portion is the only thing that Chinese oil merchants are competing for. Other kerosene is sold in the interior, and the prices vary according to the region, and it has not yet reached the point of competition. Today (ie yesterday), the chief of the gasoline department of our company, Mr. Li, and others will begin a meeting with the Oil Everywhere Company, so whether to depreciate prices or compete must be discussed and decided by the meeting. We will have accurate news tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e146">A Ghost Suing for Wrongful Death? <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>How Did Chen Liuguanzi Die?</p>
<p>Was There Saltpeter and Strong Acid in the Tea?</p>
<p>Chen Dada, the doorkeeper of the Family Industry Agency west of the District Court, had no children, so he adopted Chen Liuguanzi, the ten-year-old son of his brother Chen Er, as his son. Unexpectedly, Liuguanzi suddenly died in June of this year. Until last month, Chen's sister suddenly became possessed by the soul of Liuguanzi, suing for wrongful death, and claiming that saltpeter and strong acid were added to the tea, resulting in his death. Her crying lasted for ten hours, causing a sensation in the neighborhood. The District Court Procuratorate, after receiving the report, filed a report based on its prosecutorial responsibilities, and Chen Dada also reported to the hospital for examination in order to find out the truth. At that time, Wu Ajin, the husband of Chen's adopted daughter, was often at Chen's house, and Wu was a worker in charge of boiling water at the Industry Agency. It was also rumored that he wanted to plot Chen Dada's property, so he committed this tragedy. Wu Ajin was therefore the sole suspect and was detained by the court. The child's body was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Examination Institute to open the coffin for autopsy, and the body's throat was broken, and the intestines were cut into pieces, and the rest of the skin and flesh were intact. The situation was very suspicious, but whether he was murdered and died, and what kind of poisonous substance was used, should be waited for a detailed chemical examination before replying by letter. However, until now, the finalized examination report has not been returned to the court, so the case is still under prolonged study. Wu Ajin has been detained in prison for a long time, and after the family requested, he has been temporarily released on bail with a reliable shop guarantee and a written guarantee of 500 yuan pending trial.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Tianjin Kidnapping Gang Escorting to Shanghai, Many Criminal Cases <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Investigation Procedures Not Yet Completed</p>
<p>Trial Postponed to September 4</p>
<p>The French police previously arrested 12 men and women, including the famous kidnapping bandit Zheng Changsheng, Guan Sheng, and Geng Huatang, in Tianjin. Inspector Jin Jiulin led Head Detective Zhang Ziyu, Deputy Head Detective Zhou Bingcheng, and Detectives Qin Youyu and Cui Zhenguo to escort them to Shanghai. They were sent to the First Special District District Court for interrogation and investigation. The police have been engaged in investigation and learned that five of the defendants are the main criminals in the kidnapping case, and the others are suspected. Among the five criminals, Zheng Changsheng is a local, formerly in the car business, and participated in various kidnapping cases as a lookout and ticket watcher. Wu Shaoting, a Yangzhou native, is a ticket checker at the Taikoo Company and participated in the kidnapping case to find out the whereabouts of the hostage. In Tianjin, he kidnapped the wealthy merchant Liang Huiwu, served as a ticket watcher, and eventually tore up the ticket. Li Yueshan, a native of Huizhou, is in the bean and wheat business and was responsible for watching the ticket. Liu Yiming, alias Chen Xuchu, formerly served in the military, kidnapped and tore up Chen Zhuling, the compradore of the Jardine Matheson in Tianjin. He also participated in various cases in Shanghai as a ticket watcher, and in the winter of the 19th year of the Republic of China, he strangled Xiao Shaoxing to death and threw the body on Beidang Road. Shang Zhen, a native of Henan, was in the military, kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the president of the China and South Bank, shot the security guard Wu Xiying, the coachman Yu Yuncai, and contacted the ransom. He was killed by his accomplices on the run on Zhongshan Road for swallowing 100,000 yuan of ransom money. He also kidnapped Chen Yanghe, the vice president of the Four Ming Bank, to serve as a lookout in the case, and was responsible for watching the tickets in the cases of Gu Zelin, the son of Gu Zizhen at No. 95 Avenue Massenet, and He Shaoting at No. 84 Avenue Petain. Geng Huatang was involved in a kidnapping case in the French Concession in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and the French police issued an arrest warrant that was not obtained. The investigation is not yet complete. Yesterday, because the trial date was approaching, the police sent the defendants to the court. The defense lawyers hired by the defendants Zheng Changsheng et al., Wang Shizong and Jin Yu, also went to the court to await instructions. At 10:30 AM, Judge Li Changnian took the stand in the first criminal court for preliminary trial. Police Lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the defendants in this case committed many crimes and the circumstances were complicated. The police investigation procedures have not yet been completed, and requested that the deadline be extended for another two weeks to allow for a detailed investigation. The court reviewed the report and then ordered that the trial be rescheduled for the morning of September 4, and the defendants were still separately returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Thief Attempts to Escape and is Arrested <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Rusheng Jumps Over the Wall and Escapes</p>
<p>Detectives Bravely Chase and Arrest</p>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported to Director Wen yesterday, "At about 7:00 AM on the 19th of this month, Lu Jinsen, a detective from our team, arrested Zhou Rusheng, an habitual thief, at the intersection of Mofang Street, Minguo Road. Because the thief had committed many crimes, he was temporarily detained in the team to investigate the remaining accomplices and investigate the stolen goods. At about 11:00 AM, the thief suddenly wanted to defecate. At the same time, two other criminals also wanted to urinate. The duty detective Tian Yonggen accompanied them to the toilet to monitor them. Because the other two criminals had finished urinating, Detective Tian called another detective to take the two criminals back to custody first. Unexpectedly, in an instant, the criminal Zhou Rusheng took the opportunity to climb over the short wall and immediately escaped. When Detective Tian turned around and saw this, he rushed forward to arrest him and shouted, 'Catch the thief!' In his desperation, the criminal picked up bricks from the wall and threw them down, hitting Detective Tian in the head, and blood flowed like a注. At that time, the captain had heard the police and immediately ordered the officers to go out to apprehend him. Unexpectedly, the criminal had crossed several houses and jumped down in front of the Tongsheng Gong Candy Store on Zhonghua Road, on the left side of our bureau, intending to flee towards Langjia Bridge. The officers bravely stepped forward to chase and arrest him. At the same time, the injured detective was sent to the medical office of our bureau for dressing and treatment."</p>

<p>Besides Paying Attention to Meetings, Chen Also Reviews His Letters: Former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Li Guojie, was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment in the second instance of the High Court for borrowing foreign debts and engaging in corruption. Because Li was sent to a Shanghai hospital for treatment due to illness during the first instance, the High Court, considering the seriousness of Li's case, deemed it necessary to pay strict attention to him. Therefore, the District Court initially dispatched a bailiff to assist the police detectives of the Public Security Bureau in monitoring and protecting him. Now, additional detectives have been sent to supervise and pay attention. The Chief Prosecutor recently ordered the Judicial Police Department that, in addition to paying attention to Li Guojie's meetings, his communications should be submitted for review before being returned to him.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Opening of Two Railway Business Offices <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Director Issues a Letter to Colleagues Encouraging Hard Work and Scheduling a Supplementary Opening Ceremony to Host Guests from All Circles: The business offices of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways held their opening ceremony at 8:00 AM yesterday, immediately commencing operations. Director Huang Boqiao, Chief of the Transportation Department Zheng Baozhao, and others attended the ceremony, issuing a letter to colleagues and outlining the preparation process. According to the manager of the business office, the official opening ceremony will be supplemented by a ceremony on September 1, after the completion of the North Station, inviting guests from all circles to visit and provide guidance. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Letter to Colleagues <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Directors Huang Boqiao and Wu Shaozeng of the two railways issued a letter to colleagues, stating in brief: (1) It is not an innovation that railway business is conducted at stations, but the connection between stations and train yards is often on the periphery of a locality. Therefore, many railway operators in various countries set up separate offices in the prosperous centers of cities and convenient transportation locations to facilitate the close contact of merchants, such as the city business offices of railways in Europe and America and the city business offices of railways in Japan, all to fulfill this mission. Even in our country, the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) Railway has established an office in Xiaguan, Nanjing, with the same purpose. Therefore, the trial operation of a business office in Shanghai by this railway is not an innovation. (2) It is an independent operation and a commercial experiment. We advocate that the operation of railways should be independent and commercialized. The current establishment of a business office is a gradual step towards independent operation and, in name and in fact, it should be absolutely commercialized. Stations have become bureaucratic offices that do not consider serving the public's convenience as the mission of the railway, and this can be said to be a deeply ingrained habit that is difficult to change. The establishment of the business office is a major test for us railway operators who have already awakened, to see whether we can demonstrate the spirit of independent operation and whether we can commercialize. (3) It still requires consistent efforts from within and without. The nature of the business office is only a branch of the business section of the Transportation Department. Therefore, the commercialization of the business office still depends on the commercialization of the Transportation Department itself. If the business office is very commercialized externally, but the related parts within the Transportation Department are not sufficient to support it, then the business office's solicitations to customers will say how convenient and reliable it is, but upon arrival at the station, the reality will be the opposite. This will cause the business office to lose credibility with the public and strike a major blow to the independent operation of the railway. However, the Transportation Department is only an important part of railway operation. Other departments and offices also have considerable relations. Therefore, at the same time, other departments and offices must make all efforts consistently to help independent operation and commercialization as the goal. (4) It is merely a matter within the scope of railway operation. Some may think that there are already many travel agencies operated by Chinese and foreign merchants in the country, and the establishment of a separate business office by this railway may be beyond the scope of the railway and may be suspected of competing for business. In fact, the railway, in order to facilitate its customers, establishes an office in a certain place to receive customer inquiries, issue passenger tickets, transport luggage and packages, and also handle special products to promote its passenger and freight transportation. It is just adding a reception point, an inquiry office, and a ticket office, which is still within the scope of its own business and is still something that it should do. As for the travel agencies, they are not limited to railways, but matters such as consignment of packages cannot be handled by travel agencies. Although their business types are similar, their natures are different and they can coexist without conflict. Moreover, for any business, more promoters mean more hope. Travel agencies are promoters for the railway. Therefore, the railway would never want to maintain its own business office and oppress travel agencies that help the railway. The above four points are what we urgently want our colleagues to understand. The preparation process of the business office will also be published in this issue of this journal and need not be repeated. As for the expenses of the business office, except for some special expenses during the start-up period, the remaining staff will be transferred from the original Transportation Department personnel, and no additional personnel will be added to fill the vacancies. The regular expenses will also be covered by the original budget of the Transportation Department and will not be added separately. However, the accounts of the business office will be listed separately in the future to see the profits and losses of the business. What we hope is that this small experiment can be gradually expanded so that the public can benefit more from its convenience, which will be to complete a part of our mission.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Preparation Process <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau published the preparation process, stating: After the plan to establish a business office for this railway was approved, the Transportation Department actively carried it out. It has been decided to officially start service today. The general situation of the preparation process is described as follows: (1) Personnel Selection: The establishment of a business office is unprecedented for this railway. Since there are no established rules to follow, everything must be carefully planned, and the future responsibilities are extremely important. Therefore, the selection of personnel is extremely important. They must be young, energetic, able to endure hardship, and have meticulous thinking in order to be suitable. The Transportation Department selected nine people from various departments and transferred them to serve in the business office. (2) Formulation of Rules and Regulations: Various service methods and detailed rules of work were discussed item by item by the managers and colleagues of the business office in advance. Meetings were held day and night and progressed quickly. Whenever difficult problems arose, discussions lasted for several hours in order to strive for thoroughness and appropriateness, so as to avoid many entanglements during implementation. The following have been formulated: (1) Measures for Receiving and Sending Luggage, (2) Detailed Rules for Receiving and Sending Luggage, (3) Relationship between the Business Office for Receiving and Sending Luggage and the Information Desk and Luggage Room, (4) Measures for Receiving and Sending Parcels, (5) Detailed Rules for Receiving and Sending Parcels, (6) Measures for Booking Hotels, (7) Hotel Booking Contract, (8) Measures for Purchasing Special Products, (9) Special Product Purchase Contract, and eight types of forms. (3)</p>
<p>Establishing Procedures: The work planned for the business office is extremely numerous. It is necessary to establish procedures and implement them step by step in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, the business office first handled the following five items: (1) Answering Inquiries, (2) Booking Sleeping Berths, (3) Issuing Passenger Tickets, (4) Receiving and Sending Luggage, (5) Booking Hotels. In the future, the following will be organized in sequence: Receiving and Sending Parcels, Purchasing Special Products, Touring and Traveling, Parcel Insurance, Collection of Freight, Receiving and Sending Small Goods, and Handling Freight Procedures. (4) Contacting Hotels: Booking hotels is very important for the needs of passengers. Staff were immediately sent to contact hotels in various places, and most of them have been completed. A total of 11 hotels have signed contracts, and other hotels are still in contact. (5) Contacting Cars: The number of cars needed for transporting luggage, parcels, and goods is quite large. Since this railway could not provide them in time, a special contract was signed with Xie Xing Public Automobile Transportation Company, which has experience in handling the receiving and sending of goods, to be responsible for transporting them. The exterior of each car is also marked with the words "Business Office" for identification. (6) Internal Arrangement: The internal arrangement of the business office was also carried out simultaneously. Two red lanterns are installed inside the glass showcase, one in English and one in Chinese, with the gold letters of various businesses written below. Machine charts, etc. are placed inside the showcase. (7) Publicity Work: Since the business office is a commercial organization, it is impossible not to pay attention to publicity during the initial establishment. The currently planned publicity methods are divided into five types: (1) Placing Advertisements, (2) Printing and Distributing Letters to Passengers on the Train, (3) Radio Broadcasting, (4) Pasting Posters at Various Stations, (5) Distributing Promotional Materials According to the Telephone Book.</p>

<h3 id="e154">New Evidence in the Box Corpse Case <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Police Offered a Reward Yesterday: In the box corpse case on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru, after the culprit, Portuguese national Potto Lick Clementi As, and his accomplice brother, Joseph, were sent to the Portuguese Consulate, a preliminary hearing was held. Because the Consulate believed that it was necessary to wait for the evidence to be collected before proceeding with the trial process, the police have continued to collect evidence diligently in recent days, sparing no effort. It was successively discovered that the box cover containing the corpse was originally pasted with a piece of white paper with the name of the recipient, etc., which was first covered with blue carbon paper on the white paper, written with a pencil, and then coated with blue ink fountain pen writing. Now, the blue carbon paper has been found in Yifeng Lane. After checking, the handwriting on it is exactly the same as that on the box cover. At the same time, blood stains were found on the bedding and floor. The photo of the culprit obtained was also identified and confirmed by the landlord as the person who rented the room with the woman at the time and moved the boxes. Therefore, as of yesterday, the police had collected nine out of ten of the evidence. The only thing missing is the rickshaw puller who was hired at the time. Although the police have been investigating in all directions, there is still no trace of him. A reward was offered yesterday in the hope that the rickshaw puller who was hired at the time of the crime would report to the nearest police station to facilitate the proceedings. If there can be results within a few days, then all the evidence will be complete and formally submitted to the Portuguese Consulate. The Portuguese Consulate can then begin a public trial of the case.</p>

<p>Shanghai gentlemen Yuan Xiluo and others, in view of the fact that the First Bridge in Pudong, located at the border of their hometown of Nanzha, has been dilapidated due to years of disrepair and is becoming increasingly dangerous, and that if reconstruction is not urgently planned, it is feared that danger will befall, have jointly initiated fundraising for reconstruction with local gentry Shen Menglian, Zhang Xiaoliang, Zhang Yutian, Min Caizhang, Fu Zuoheng, Jiang Zhuoyun, etc., to benefit pedestrians and facilitate transportation. The recorded background is as follows: Weeping over the difficulty of wading across water, we sigh at the difficulty of traveling. Whipping stones into beams, we share the ambition to help people. Who will be the first to manage and initiate the project? We can rely on Zilai. Planning requires labor and care. We can rely on Bozhu. The First Bridge in our Nanzha Port in Nanhui County has been in disrepair for many years and is an important thoroughfare. The flying bridge is hidden, and the road reaches Fengxian. The water is vast, and boats travel to Xupu. Recalling the past, the flute-playing passerby rode on a long rainbow. To this day, the stone is broken, and the road is submerged. There are no birds or magpies to fill it. Although the beams are made of wood, people and horses still rest and neigh. Lacking the skill of turning lead into gold, we can only rely on the fox's armpit made of fur. Every time Xiluo and others look at the old site, they secretly wish to repair it. We are concerned about the difficulty of raising large sums of money and know that it is easy to lift with everyone's strength. We hope that kind men and faithful women will generously donate money, and we expect to accumulate tens of thousands to complete the silver ferry. Seeing the red railings and white boards in this place, it is not difficult to complete it in days. We predict that in the future, high-ranking officials will travel by horse-drawn carriages and together reach the road to heaven. All gentlemen should respond in unison. Pedestrians are already looking forward to it.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Five Key Culprits Behind the Gao Assassination Attempt Arrested <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Xu Changrong Returns His Car License Plate: The Police Consider It a Key Clue: Since the attempted assassination of a Mr. Gao by assassins who organized a gang and opened fire near Huile Lane on Yunnan Road in late last month, the Laozha Police, which has jurisdiction over the area, has been doing its utmost to investigate. Until recently, it was discovered that the case was masterminded by local Xu Changrong (also known as Xu Tingyu). At the same time, it was also discovered that Xu and his accomplices in the case were hiding in Room 418 of the Shanghai Grand Hotel on Tianjin Road, plotting a second assassination attempt against Mr. Gao. Hua Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Liu Junqing, Xie Shuiquan, Zhou Guirong, and others, after understanding the situation, armed themselves and rushed to the room silently late the night before. They took Xu and his accomplices Zhuang Haiquan, Chen Hanzhang from Guizhou, Du Ailin from Chongming (the chauffeur who instigated Xu), and Xie Furong from Suzhou, a total of five people, to the police station for detention. They were sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. According to the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, who appeared in court, after investigating Xu's plans and the Mr. Gao whom they wanted to harm, the police are still continuing to investigate. Therefore, for the time being, no charges will be brought against them. He requested that they still be detained until the investigation is clarified before a decision is made. Judge Feng then asked Xu Changrong and others one by one about their names, ages, and places of origin. He then approved the police's request and ordered Xu and others to remain in detention and be interrogated again at a later date. However, it is heard that the police still have a key point to thoroughly investigate in this case. That is, when the case occurred, someone witnessed a car with the license plate 5070, which Xu had prepared, parked near the Dahua Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Fuzhou Road, which was far from the scene of the incident. After several gunshots, the car hurriedly fled. Afterwards, someone based on this clue questioned Xu, but Xu stammered and said that he himself was lying at home at the time and the car had not driven out. After this questioning, the culprit realized the importance of the matter. In order to eliminate the evidence in advance, it is heard that he recently returned the car license plate. If this is true, it would be a major refutation of the case. Therefore, the police are currently making every effort to investigate this point.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the social news article published in your newspaper on the 20th of this month, titled "Kong Wanyu Commits Suicide by Poisoning Over Rent Dispute," which stated, "Kong delivered the payment to the court on August 1st, but the landlord was not notified by the court, leading to a grave mistake," the original terms of settlement in this case stipulated that the defendant should pay arrears of 101.7 yuan per installment at the end of April and May of this year. If the payments were not made on time, the plaintiff could request full execution of 202.14 yuan and demand that the defendant vacate the premises. The defendant failed to pay the rent by the deadline. On June 30th, the plaintiff filed a petition for eviction. This court issued a further summons. The defendant only paid 68 yuan on July 14th, and was instructed to clear the balance by July 26th, and was also urged to negotiate with the plaintiff to possibly avoid eviction. As the payment was not made by the deadline, on July 26th, the plaintiff and defendant were notified that the eviction order would be executed. The bailiff carried out the eviction on August 5th. Although the defendant paid 100 yuan on August 1st, he had repeatedly missed deadlines, and this could not stop the execution of the eviction order. This court handled this case without any errors. The information in your newspaper is inaccurate. Please correct it to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item published in your newspaper on the 19th of this month, where a Central News Agency reporter inquired with the Land Bureau and published an article titled "City Land Price Tax to be Prepared for Collection," which contained the statement, "As for the commercial districts, there are still some agricultural lands, so it has been decided not to collect land price tax but to continue collecting agricultural tax," this is not in accordance with the facts. All land within the designated and announced commercial districts must be subject to land price tax. Only agricultural land outside the designated district boundaries will not be subject to price tax and will continue to be subject to agricultural tax. Therefore, we request that your newspaper make the necessary corrections.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Japan Plans to Nationalize All Secondary School Textbooks <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Eliminating the Competition and Sales Practices</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 21st) The Ministry of Education plans to nationalize or semi-nationalize all textbooks for various secondary schools, including middle schools, girls' schools, agricultural, industrial, and commercial schools, as is currently done with elementary school textbooks. The Ministry of Education will issue the textbooks or compile them under its supervision. Currently, this proposed reform is being studied in the library. Under the current secondary school textbook examination system, private publishers are free to compile textbooks and schools are free to use them. Recently, the number of applications for examination has increased dramatically. There are currently as many as 120 types of English textbooks and 80 types of Chinese textbooks. Due to competitive sales practices, significant advertising expenses are incurred. As a result, not only are the prices high, but it is also reported that there are often various collusions between sellers and school principals or teachers. The Ministry of Education plans to reduce textbook prices by 40% compared to current levels and eliminate the aforementioned malpractices. If the nationalization or semi-nationalization of textbooks is realized, it will have significant implications for the unification of secondary education.</p>

<p>Cheng Shi, Chairman, Delivers Opening Address</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The Jiangxi Provincial Educational Administrative Conference was held in the auditorium of the Department of Education at 9:00 AM on the 16th. The chairman, Cheng Shi, Director of the Department of Education, presided over the meeting, which was attended by more than 300 people. After the opening ceremony, Cheng reported that the initiation of this conference was based on the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who believed that education in the bandit-affected areas of Jiangxi Province was of great importance. He ordered a conference of secondary school principals to be held. He felt it was better to expand the scope and hold an educational administrative conference to seek overall solutions. The proposals are divided into seven groups, each with one or two core proposals submitted by the department for centralized discussion. There were 60 proposals from members, divided as follows: 18 from the Local Educational Administration Group, 7 from the Bandit-Affected Area Education Group, 7 from the Health Education Group, 5 from the Youth Training Group, 9 from the Vocational Education Group, 12 from the Mass Education Group, and 2 from the Boy Scout Training Group. The significance of convening this conference can be summarized in three points: 1) It is hoped that the conference proposals will be practical and feasible, so as to avoid the shortcomings of previous conferences where discussions did not lead to action. The most practical areas in Jiangxi are bandit-affected area education and mass education. We must spend less money and work harder. Those who are literate should have the obligation to teach those who are illiterate, and those who are illiterate should have the obligation to become literate. 2) It is hoped that the conference participants will concentrate their time, talent, and ideas for discussion. 3) It is hoped that the conference participants will work together to improve. Whether education is well-managed in the future is entirely the responsibility of everyone. It is hoped that everyone will have the greatest awareness and make sacrifices and efforts, so that there is hope for educational improvement. Next, representatives of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Liu Jiashu of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Wu Jiantao of the Provincial Government gave instructions. Finally, representatives of the members gave speeches and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>June 30th (Friday)</p>
<p>Today, although there were no major events, an unexpected change occurred, just like Faqua's defeat of Panlai on Wednesday. Nees defeated Cedar in three straight sets, and Lee had won the first two sets against Stokes, and was leading 3-1. This game undoubtedly gave the resident players a great shock, but in fact, there is enough to comfort and explain themselves, because Stokes has exhausted his strength, with greatly improved skills, to defeat a Lee who was extremely exhausted. The weather was very warm, full of humidity, and the sun alternated with white clouds, but it did not seem to have two intentions. The audience was still large. Those who could not enter the Central Court or the First Court surrounded other outer courts, quietly listening to the applause from the Central and First Courts. The closing match of the First Court was Mrs. Maddy against Mrs. Henroding. The French woman won a total of only three games, all in the first set. Mrs. Maddy was slightly lax and made many unnecessary mistakes. Afterwards, she worked hard, without any leniency, and defeated Henroding with machine-like balls.</p>
<p>The match between Cedar and Hughes followed. Cedar won the first three games, and although he resisted strongly, he did not panic. Afterwards, Hughes won nine games in the next thirteen games. Cedar was unable to take advantage of opportunities. Although his hitting technique was not relaxed and optimistic, this mixed method could not be practical against a player who never lost his confidence and gradually increased his strength. Hughes had nothing to lose and was always in the lead, with excellent judgment, careful, courageous, and able to advance in time. Most of the time, Cedar attacked with a close and powerful forehand draw, and the ball hit the racket like an explosion.</p>
<p>In the first and second sets, there is no need to elaborate. Cedar's strategy was not bad, but his method was wrong. He could take the lead with confidence and understanding, but he could not maintain it. A game or a set often required a winning shot, but it was obtained by Hughes. The first and second sets were exactly the same, only the second set was lost more easily. Cedar's eyesight also deteriorated greatly. Often, he could see the falling ball, but Cedar wanted to hit it but missed it. There were too many mistakes compared to usual, often sending the ball into the net or slightly out of bounds.</p>
<p>Later, he was subjected to heavy pressure again, but he was bold and intelligent. Hughes may have given his best performance ever and continued to improve. Every shot was taken with risk. If it was successful, he would not regret it. He won the first set with nine to seven, followed by seven to five. Cedar's defeat was well deserved. The overall game was 15% to 50% worse than his usual performance.</p>
<p>The third set started wrong again, but he gradually recovered and took a 3-1 lead. Suddenly, he collapsed from there, unable to win a single game. His luck was also too bad, often with balls that seemed good, but the result was the opposite. Hughes had the feeling of controlling the enemy. In the last few games, his momentum was unstoppable. Cedar fell into despair. Hughes had better stamina on the court than Cedar. Cedar seemed to have suffered from heatstroke in the second set, leaning on a chair to rest, drinking a large amount of water, wiping himself with a towel, and covering his head and neck with a wet towel. Hughes showed no signs of fatigue and was ready to continue the game at any time.</p>

It is said that the team has various job responsibilities, so they can stay in Shanghai for at most one week before returning to Ning. If the above-mentioned teams wish to have friendly matches with the Kelite team, please notify Xu Duo of the Shanghai Postal Administration so that he can contact the Kelite team for all matters.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Baihong Track and Field Team's Opinions on the National Games <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The Baihong Track and Field Team submitted a document to the National Games Preparatory Committee on the ninth of this month, stating: "Submitting opinions for adoption and implementation. Since the Preparatory Committee announced that the games would be held on Double Ten Festival this year, the national sports community has shown a lively atmosphere. In the future, the gathering in the capital will be promising. Our team has been practicing track and field for many years. Regarding this conference, regarding the number of places and events under the track and field category, we would like to express our humble opinions. If they can be adopted, we would be very fortunate.</p>
<p>㈠ The number of places should be changed to a six-person system, and it should be stipulated that each unit's athletes attending each event should not exceed four people at most. In our country's National Games track and field category, the number of places for each event has always only been four. However, it is found that there are more than thirty participating provincial and municipal units in the National Games, and there should be no fewer than five or six hundred track and field athletes. With five or six hundred people competing for a small number of places, their efforts are equally matched. There will inevitably be many people who fail to make the list due to a slight difference. It is found that modern sports meets with a larger scale, not to mention them, the Japanese National Games also take six places. This embodies the purpose of selecting true talents and encouraging future generations. In the budding era of sports in our country, this system seems to be urgently emulated. Moreover, sports in our country are not only immature, but also unevenly developed. Shanghai, Ping, Ji, and Yue are roughly scaled, while the provinces in the interior are just starting. In the previous Hangzhou National Games, all the championships were won by the stronger units, and the inland units failed to win anything. Although this conforms to the formula of the superior winning and the inferior being eliminated, the inland sports will inevitably become more boring after this blow. If this system can be adopted, and it is stipulated that each province and city unit attending track and field events should be limited to a maximum of four athletes per event, then any strong provincial and municipal unit will never be able to monopolize all the places. There must be one or two positions left for the weaker units to compete for. This can arouse the interest of inland sports and achieve the effect of universal development.</p>
<p>㈡ Various events should strive to follow the current events of the World Games and expand sports in our country. We should not only aim at the Far East, but should broaden our horizons and aim at the world. It is found that the track and field events of the World Games have more events than the National Games, including the 3000-meter steeplechase, 5000 meters, marathon, race walking, and hammer throw. Our country should not abandon them just because the Far East Games do not have them. We should immediately adopt them and list them as National Games events. If there is a short time and various places have not been prepared, it may be temporarily designated as a performance, and various units should be notified to participate as much as possible.</p>
<p>Whether the above two points are appropriate, I hope to be given a discussion. I am very much looking forward to it. This is presented to the National Games Preparatory Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Hunger <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Yun</p>
<p>'Hunger.' This word does not need to be explained literally. Those who are full all day long will never understand how miserable the state of hunger is.</p>
<p>In the Dongxinqiao and Great World areas, the 'wild chickens' stand erect on the streets. Why do they stand from afternoon until midnight every day, and sometimes use dragging and binding methods on pedestrians? Are they satisfying their sexual desires? This is entirely hunger urging them to use despicable and lowly methods to satisfy the panic of their stomachs.</p>
<p>Now it's better. The French Concession police authorities, in order to maintain order on the roads and the peace of pedestrians, have uniformly prohibited them from operating outside. Recently, many have been detained in the patrol room. This is almost taking away the rice bowl in their hands. It is a terrible thing to not allow a person to eat!</p>
<p>We must come back to the point. Of course, wild chickens soliciting customers outside has a very bad influence on both society and individuals. We are also very sympathetic to the crackdown. But hunger is the same for everyone. For example, sometimes when my meal is cooked late, my stomach will rumble and make a lot of noise, urging me to eat.</p>
<p>Imagine, what is the rumbling in the stomachs of those who have no hope of eating? It must be intensely unfair, and the result is that rebellious emotions are produced in this unstable situation. The strong take risks and do all kinds of evil deeds. The weak commit suicide, become beggars, or engage in the flesh trade. So becoming a 'wild chicken' is not their own will, and of course it is inseparable from the background of hunger.</p>
<p>Since the sins of society are created in an environment of hunger, then society should think of ways to eliminate the fact of hunger. But, on the contrary, society is constantly creating the background of hunger; bankers desperately concentrate money, capitalists desperately seek self-sufficiency, big merchants desperately monopolize business:::: there is no need to say more. There are many people in society who exploit others by virtue of their status and power, all of whom are seizing the food of the majority to cultivate themselves, so the formation of hunger is a very common phenomenon.</p>
<p>The fact of hunger has become widespread, and many people do not know the feeling of hunger. Those who are hungry and those who are not hungry are separated. Naturally, this word "hunger" will always occupy an important page in the dictionary.</p>
<p>O God of Hunger! May you forever occupy a separate position in people's stomachs!</p>
<h3 id="e200">Summer Clouds, Many Strange Peaks <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ying</p>
<p>Tired of reading at noon, put down the book and take a nap, this is exactly the life of summer. But you are in the depths of the willow shade, looking up at the sky, and the layers of white clouds transform into many patterns. Some are like cowherds riding cows, some are like warriors dancing swords, no matter how you imagine them, they are all excellent natural paintings. Therefore, I feel that the ancients' saying that "summer clouds have many strange peaks" is not wrong at all.</p>
<p>Most people think that the most difficult thing to grasp is a woman's psychology, but I think the most difficult thing to grasp is the weather in summer. When you go out, the scorching sun radiates heat, scorching your skin; but maybe in a flash, a gust of cool wind comes, and the white clouds immediately turn into dark clouds, and the rain drops as big as beans splash down, catching people off guard. If you bring an umbrella and galoshes, it just doesn't rain.</p>
<p>Most of the fashionable women nowadays wear thin gauze like cicada wings, and their snow-white skin is faintly visible. The tailoring of new clothes is in harmony with the curves of the body, almost like wrapping. Wearing wobbly high-heeled shoes, if you encounter a sudden rain, you want to avoid dancing and dancing, and as a result, you are soaked like Yang Guifei emerging from a bath, allowing the poor people to appreciate this graceful beauty; I really feel embarrassed for them.</p>
<p>However, what is more changeable than summer clouds and summer rain is the political views of the adults and gentlemen. Today it is going east, tomorrow it will go west, making it simply difficult for subordinates to serve. Unless they are roundworms in their stomachs, this is how they know their intentions, otherwise a move will guarantee that you will not be reprimanded, but you will also encounter a rubber nail.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Night-Wandering Gentleman <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>I say "Night-Wandering Gentleman," and someone asks who is that person's name? I reply to him that this term is not a person's nickname, but a small "firefly." Fireflies often shine in the dark at night, and they will flash in our eyes, which is very beautiful. Therefore, although the firefly is a very small kind of insect, the ancients gave it many names, which I really cannot list. The most interesting one can be considered the four characters "Night-Wandering Gentleman," which I feel is especially accurate and immovable, and worth talking about!</p>
<p>This kind of insect, in its early stage, also resembles mosquitoes, close to beetles, and its color is slightly yellow. If zoologists summarize it, they would have to call it a "sheathed wings" type. However, its hair ends are rich in phosphorus, so it naturally emits a kind of cold light, like the noctiluca on the sea. Isn't this a unique feature in the insect world? Not only that, the hotter the weather, the stronger its luminous power is in the middle of the night. Children often enjoy the cool in the courtyard, and it just happens to fly down from the corner of the wall and eaves. In a short while, it has been patted under the cattail fan and put into a gourd-shaped glass bottle. Childhood is inherently good, and when the night is quiet and late, and they are lying down to sleep, they put it by the pillow. You! If you want to read, you can read ten lines at a glance, very clearly, or hang it in the middle of the tent, which can be regarded as a naturally formed small electric lamp that can illuminate until dawn. Therefore, "fireflies" are a kind of grace for children. It is said that in North America, there are many natives who, when walking into the forest at night, fear that the darkness will cause them to lose their way, and they capture very large "fireflies" and tie them between the toes of their feet. Walking is still like walking under the moon! The Sui Emperor of our country once went out for a night tour one day, and the history books record that he released several bushels of fireflies. In an instant, the light was like daytime. Although it is unavoidable to say too much, I think that if someone gathers them together and deeply studies their life and breeding methods, not only is it a very fun skill, but it can be said that its effect is not small, and it is more appropriate to call it "Mingdeng" rather than calling it "Gongzi," which is truly worthy of the name.</p>

<p>— Bing You</p>
<p>A few days ago, the major newspaper's news column published a piece of fact about the auction of Napoleon's legacy letters, which seemed very interesting. I remember that the same thing was discovered in Berlin in 1909. At that time, what was auctioned was a letter from Napoleon to his lover Xue Fen when he led his troops to attack Italy, written with full of love and tender words. It is really a hundred-refined steel that has also turned into a soft finger. Later, the French in Germany heard about it and treated it as a shameful thing, so they bought it for one hundred and twenty pounds and took it back to their motherland. This auction may have that letter in it?</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen, Abandoning His Post to Meet Soulmate, the Beauty Tacitly Agrees, Inheriting the Family, the Strong Man Rejoices</p>
<p>There are still these thin properties in my family, and the child is in the prime of his life and strong. As long as he is willing to work, he can still start a family. To be honest, when I see other people have families, I think of families, and when I see other people have children, I also think of children. What else can old people think about? Isn't it just these hopes? Ever since we became neighbors, I saw that your eldest daughter is really a good child. Although I had that idea of proposing a marriage, I was always embarrassed to open my mouth. Now that you and your daughter have both agreed, my hopes for the rest of my life have been settled. Guess how happy I am. Although my son is a company commander, I still manage the family affairs myself. In the future, when your daughter comes through the door, taking on this share of the burden, I don't have to worry about anything, just waiting to hold my grandson, how happy. Even your old mother will finally make it through when she sees her grandson, right? Hahaha! After speaking, he opened his throat and burst into laughter. He laughed so loudly in the house that there was also a loud bang in the courtyard. Old Zhao raised his head and asked outside the house, "Xiao Lin, what's wrong with you? What did you smash?" Xiao Lin said, "I'm in the house, who is making a noise in the courtyard? It must be that new-mouthed cat, right?" Everyone was guessing like this, but they heard a burst of footsteps, which went straight to the front yard. Then, the Yang family's wind door also made a thumping sound. Ms. Jiang understood in her heart that this was her daughter coming to eavesdrop. At that time, it was inconvenient to make a sound. So she asked Old Zhao, "Yes, there are two neighbors here who are raising big cats, and they often come out to harm people." Old Zhao smiled, stroked his mustache twice, and then shouted, "Xiao Lin, send that half of the salted fish to the front yard and ask Miss Yang to taste it." (165)</p>
<h3 id="e204">About Women's Breasts <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Zhao</p>
<p>Women's breasts are the most sensual and curvaceous posture, especially the soft, smooth feeling, which is intoxicating and makes people's minds wander. No wonder the young lads who "do not know the taste of meat" now want to "seek it in dreams."</p>
<p>According to modern medical experts, women's breasts that are firm, strong, and high-perched are a sign of health, and those that are weak and drooping are a sign of frailty. Most of our noble Chinese women's breasts are as the latter described, and the reason for this is of course "breast binding."</p>
<p>In the world, the most healthy and developed women's breasts are those of the Slavic people, followed by the Anglo-Saxons. French women's breasts are the most beautiful and artistic, because they all use artificial surgery to beautify their breasts in order to flaunt and please men. However, most of our Chinese women's breasts have degenerated and declined under the two traditional concepts of "morbid beauty" and "damage to appearance."</p>
<p>Among those who praised women's breasts most strongly and were passed down to later generations as a beautiful story, the first to be recommended was the French writer Laclos of the mid-eighteenth century. He had written many works about women's breasts, especially the novel "Dangerous Liaisons," which praised, eulogized, and described women's breasts vividly. Later generations therefore called him a "pornographic writer."</p>
<p>The year before last, I saw an article in an English newspaper about "women's breast thieves," which roughly said that in the city of Liverpool, there was a young man who specialized in stealing women's breasts in public places (I have forgotten his surname). After he was arrested, he confessed in court that he had stolen 114 women's breasts.</p>
<p>This person can be called a breast-touching doctor! Laugh</p>
<h3 id="e205">New Inventions by Chinese Inventors <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Transmitted from Ji</p>
<p>Recently, China has produced quite a few inventors. For example, Mr. Tang Zhongming, who invented charcoal as a substitute for gasoline, caused quite a stir for a time, earning the praise of the Ministry of Industry. He even conducted a field test on the long-distance bus route between Nanjing and Tangshan, and it is said that the results were very satisfactory. Mr. Wang Richang from Hubei invented an anti-aircraft arrow, which was tested in the open space of the barracks near the Nanyang Tobacco Factory in Hankou. It reached a height of 4,000 meters and exploded in the air at 30 meters, with very good results. Mr. Huang Zhirong, a technician at the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department's Ordnance Repair Factory in Zhenjiang, invented a new type of portable machine gun that can freely operate the safety mechanism. Turning it left allows for rapid firing, while turning it right allows for single firing. A bayonet can also be mounted on top of the machine gun. Rapid firing is like a continuous stream of bullets, extraordinarily sharp. It is said that the authorities will forward it to the central government for commendation. Mr. Fan Zhenjiang from Bian invented a two-section mortar, with a long shooting range, reaching up to 7,000 meters, exceeding the range of anti-aircraft guns. His father, Guoliang, also invented an assault steel plate vehicle. In addition, a student, Mr. X, from Tongji University invented a private secret wireless radio, and a student from Hunan University invented a trackless train. It is said that the test results were all good. These inventors have all emerged within the past year or two. In China, where the level of science is backward, this can be considered quite encouraging. However, these inventions are like flashes in the pan, and are not seen in formal use anywhere. They appear like a dragon, showing only the head and not the tail. I cannot help but sigh in regret for the inventors!</p>
<p>Some people say that China's invention endeavors will never have good results, because the children of wealthy people indulge in pleasure and are absolutely unwilling to spend years diligently studying these troublesome things. People without money, although interested in science, have no money to buy reference books, no money to purchase experimental materials, and even less money to attend school. Even if there are one or two talented scientists, they cannot freely develop their talents due to environmental constraints. Therefore, those who want to study science cannot find a way in, and those who have already found a way stop their research work midway. This statement has some merit, but I think this is not the absolute reason!</p>
<p>The inventor of the microscope, Leeuwenhoek (Dutch), initially worked as a copyist for others. The inventor of the steamboat, Fulton (American), was so poor that he relied on his mother's work to make a living. The inventor of the railway, Stephenson (British), was originally a cowherd. The inventor of the light bulb, movies, and phonograph, Edison (American), went to work as a train attendant on the Canadian railway at the age of twelve, which shows his poverty. It can be seen that people with scientific minds are not limited in the development of their talents due to difficult family lives. Then, the reason why China's recent inventors cannot contribute their research results to society, nor can they promote and develop their research work, certainly has its own special reasons, and is definitely not entirely limited by poverty. These special reasons are nothing more than the following two:</p>
<p>(1) The government does not provide rewards and assistance. (2) Domestic disasters occur frequently, making it impossible to continue their research work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>The above two points are only part of the special reasons that hinder the invention endeavors, and are not insurmountable obstacles. After Morse (American) invented the telegraph, he first reported it to the government, but the government ignored him. After Galileo (Italian) invented the telescope, although he was hired by the King of Venice, he was angered by the Pope when he returned to his home country, who said that his book violated the Bible, and he was even taken to the church for severe torture. However, their inventions were eventually adopted by the world. If disasters occur frequently, it is impossible to study science with peace of mind, then how could there be an aviation king Karcher before and after the European war? It can be seen that anyone who is determined to study science cannot be suppressed by any obstacles. China's new inventors lack the courage to persevere. Although they have made small inventions, they become discouraged due to a temporary lack of material assistance or after suffering a blow, and eventually disappear without a trace. This is probably the main reason for their failure!</p>

<h3 id="e206">Book of Great Peace Under Heaven <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lin Yutang suddenly had a whim and expressed his opinion in this column: "Let the women do it," proposing to hand over all governing power to women, and he himself is determined to prepare to retire and go to Africa to learn to be a savage. This is indeed a very commendable opinion.</p>
<p>The "Book of Great Peace Under Heaven," a large book written by Liu Renhang, was first published in the early years of the Republic of China in 17 by the Shanghai Taidong Bookstore. The author named the book "Book of Great Peace Under Heaven" because he believed that the world could achieve peace immediately by following the book. His advocacy is self-proclaimed as the world's "Kun-transformationism," and its goal is to establish a world female government. What Liu Renhang says in his book is nothing more than that men value killing, while women are inclined to harmony and love. All the wars and killings in history have been caused by men, while women are the ones who give birth to people. He asks, "Do men become pregnant?" to show his unbreakable truth that men kill and women give life. Therefore, once women take charge of the government, they will definitely know that people are lovable and should be loved and not killed, war will be eliminated, and the world will be peaceful as a result.</p>
<p>In this way, it is indeed reasonable. If I add some supplements, then this reason will truly become undeniable, and the emergence of a female government should be promoted and will be endorsed by the masses, and the seeds of world harmony and peace will be obtained. The two sexes of men and women can indeed be called two major opposing classes, with women standing in the position of the oppressed. If we say that the modern problem lies in the opposition between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, or the struggle of the fourth class against other classes, then what will follow will definitely be the opposition between men and women, the struggle of women against men. Modern workers get angry in the factory and go home to vent their anger on their wives and daughters. Rickshaw pullers who suffer losses from the police will also take revenge on their wives and daughters. Therefore, the oppression of women is even below the fourth class, so after the class struggle, there must be a struggle between the two sexes. The revolutionary struggle of the fourth class is still continuing to evolve, and the intensity of its harm is already enough to make people feel heartbroken. In the future, there is a possibility that it will be staged again and again, and the oppression of women has a longer history and a more severe degree of suffering, so once a women's revolution occurs, it must be the most cruel tragedy in the world. The current struggle almost has no formal female protagonist, so it is not the entire human race, but limited to the male gender, when the women's revolution occurs, it will be more extensive than the current, and the entire human race can not escape being swept into the whirlpool.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the occurrence of this tragedy, there is only one way for us men to surrender and lower our flags, like Lin Yutang's preparation to retire to Africa, which is one of the most brilliant methods. Liu Renhang's method is to first establish a world female government to prevent problems before they occur, which is even more clever. We Chinese people, in everything, love to fundamentally solve and thoroughly research, and pay attention to the way of long-term peace and stability, wholeheartedly hoping for peace under heaven and world harmony, and will definitely feel a twelve-point interest in what is said here. In school trials, there are also university students who elect female opera performers and actresses to be chairmen or presidents, which shows that if a female government is established, it will definitely be supported by a majority of people. Moreover, judging from the authority of school flowers and queens in schools today, it can be seen that the opinions of female governments are by no means frivolous. Hu Shih called on us to talk about the resistance against Japan in fifty years, and now we want to devote ourselves to cultivating national strength, so why not prepare for the world female government that should exist five thousand years from now? This is a matter of achieving peace under heaven and world harmony in one fell swoop, which is more worthy of effort than anything else, and besides, aren't we already moving in this direction?</p>
<h3 id="e207">Rationalization of English and Basic English <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Suo Yuan</p>
<p>There have already been two articles opposing Basic English in the North (see the "Beiping World Daily"), but they criticized Basic English from the perspective of an international language. As I understand it, Basic English is entirely an internal improvement problem of English, just like Japan's restriction of Chinese characters, and it is not what the advertisements say that it can be an international language. Here, I would like to criticize Basic English as a rationalization plan for English.</p>
<p>As I think, the rationalization of English should at least achieve the following two things:</p>
<p>The first is the rationalization of spelling, such as the vowel A, which has various different pronunciations, but the spelling all uses A. The same K and F sounds, but there are two spellings of C, K and F, PH. With KS and GZ, the extra X is added to make up the number. In addition, GHK, etc. in words such as Right know, etc. are not pronounced. These should be rationally transformed according to the principle of "one sound one letter, one letter one sound."</p>
<p>The second is the simplification of grammar. The irrational exceptions in English irregular verbs (Go-went-gone), exceptions to the plural of nouns (Foot-Feet-qoxes), and the addition of S to the third person singular present tense verbs: etc. should be rationally simplified, or even completely eliminated.</p>
<p>But what about Basic English? As evidenced by the various books that have been published, it completely inherits the irrational heritage of English in the above two points. Basic English mechanically stipulates a vocabulary of 850 words as its characteristic, but it is also its fatal flaw. Although the vocabulary of primitive humans is only more than 100 words, and the aborigines of Africa now only use more than 300 words, is that kind of primitive expression method of "a polished black circle with a dog drawn in front of a trumpet" applicable to modern people? That is a very obvious thing. The mechanical determination of the vocabulary makes Basic English become a "dead thing" and suffocates the possibility of the development of this language. If the originator does not regard Basic English only as a method of teaching English, and an inseparable appendage of English, but attempts to use Basic English as an independent language, a rationalization plan that can replace English, then it must be said that it is a complete failure.</p>
<p>This failure is by no means accidental. The work of rationalizing English will never be completed by Ogden, the director of the Language Research Institute of Cambridge University, who is a government-employed language scholar. For him, because of his position and the social class to which he belongs, he has neither the possibility of understanding language from a developmental perspective, nor the courage and strength to fundamentally transform English. At present, that kind of thorough rationalization will be severely criticized for "desecrating the sacredness of the national language" and "destroying the dignity of the grammar of the national language." The rulers of Great Britain only welcome Ogden's reformist deceptive schemes, because the true rationalization of English is beneficial to the British people, but unfavorable to the rulers.</p>
<p>However, the failure of Basic English is not enough to prove the impossibility of rationalizing English. English will still have a day when it is thoroughly rationalized by the British people themselves, just as the writing systems of China and Japan will complete true Romanization.</p>
<h3 id="e208">On Sequels <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>To ridicule sequels as evil works, as a snake's tail added to a sable coat; Jin Shengtan in the early Qing Dynasty was most impolite to "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Water Margin", referring to the part after "Grass Bridge" as a sequel by Guan Hanqing, and a generation of playwrights almost suffered injustice: as for "Water Margin", he simply cut off the part after the 70th chapter. After Yu Pingbo determined that the sequel to "Dream of the Red Chamber" was written by Gao E, the advantages and disadvantages of the upper and lower sections have been concluded, not only are "Completing the Dream" and "Repeating the Dream" superfluous. Yu Pingbo said: "There are no good sequels, not because the talent of the person writing the sequel must be far inferior to that of the predecessor, but because the talent and personality are different, just like their faces, if they are forced to follow each other, it will cause harm to both sides." ("Dream of the Red Chamber" first volume, page six) Mr. Qifan said: "Sequels are not easy to write, at least not as easy as creating a new path; there are also people who truly write sequels, but those who do well are still very few." These are all true insights and are very well said.</p>
<p>However, Jin Shengtan, Yu Pingbo, and Mr. Qifan all only argued from the perspective of literary creation; in the eyes of us who study history, "history" is almost devoid of creation, and every historical work is a sequel. The "Records of the Grand Historian" (史記), which has been praised for thousands of years, was preceded by "Genealogy of Emperors and Kings" (世本); after the Grand Historian, Sima Qian, Chu Shaosun, Liu Xiang, Liu Xin, Feng Shang, Yang Xiong, Feng Yan, Xiao Fen and a dozen or twenty others continued to revise the "Records of the Grand Historian." Ban Gu, the predecessor of the "Book of Han", was "Historical Records Post Transmission" written by his father Ban Biao. After Ban Gu, Ban Zhao and Feng Yan continued to write the book. Fan Ye's "Book of the Later Han" (後漢書) is as important as the "Book of Han" of Ban Gu; In fact, someone had already started writing during the Eastern Han Dynasty, Liu Zhen and Li You wrote "Annals and Tables of Famous Officials and Loyal Gentlemen Biographies of Imperial Relatives", and Cai Yong wrote "Two Records of Court Meetings and Chariot Clothing". In the early Jin Dynasty, Sima Biao wrote "Continuation of the Book of Han", and Hua Qiao revised "Records of Dongguan" into "Book of Later Han". Finally, Fan Ye compiled and deleted tedious additions and omissions, and wrote the "Book of the Later Han". When Fan Ye was arrested, the ten records were not yet completed, and Liu Zhao continued to complete them. Is the value of inheriting the achievements of predecessors, completing great works by continuing and supplementing, inferior to that of creation?</p>
<p>In the early Qing Dynasty, Huang Lizhou wrote "Cases of Confucian Scholars of the Ming Dynasty," wanting to use his full strength to organize the academic system of the Song and Yuan Dynasties over seven hundred years, setting down the outline to compile the "Cases of Scholars of Song and Yuan Dynasties." He was too old after all, and he died before the book was completed. He handed over all the work to his son Zong Yan to do, but Zong Yan did not compile it successfully either. All Zuwang devoted his life to continuing the "Cases of Scholars of Song and Yuan Dynasties", from the tenth to the nineteenth years of Qianlong, in these ten years, he supplemented and wrote "Cases of Scholars of Song and Yuan Dynasties" every year. After Zuwang died, the manuscript of the "Cases" was kept by his disciple Lu Hao, and Lizhou's great-grandson Zhigui borrowed it to transcribe, and then All Zuwang's son Pingfu corrected the errors and filled in the gaps, and wrote another version. It was not until the eighteenth year of Daoguang that the "Cases" were first printed, and Wang Xuanchen also corrected and supplemented them to complete one hundred volumes. A person's energy is limited, and a person's life is limited. A valuable work can never be completed by one person. In a world where all copyrights are owned, "sequels" are originally just profitable commodities, and it is almost regarded as a miracle to complete a work in half a century or a century by the strategy of the masses. But truly thinking for the sake of scholarship itself, and for the welfare of the community, even if it is a "sequel", isn't it an important part of great creation?</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to add an explanation for Mr. Qifan. So-called undertakings always belong to the community; the Buddha said that all sentient beings and all inanimate things are created by the karma of all sentient beings. Literary creation, from the community becoming individual, and from the streets being confined to the study, is a unique deformity of modern times. Since ancient times, everyone participated in the work of creation in the chanting of ballads and the telling of stories, and it is almost impossible to know who is the creator and who is the continuer. The book "Water Margin" can only be said to be a joint creation of thousands of people over hundreds of years since the Southern Song Dynasty. Until today, storytellers in Eastern bookstores are still doing the work of writing sequels there. The time is coming soon when we will liberate from the study to the streets, and return from desk creation to community collective creation. I believe that the need for sequels in literature is no different from the need for sequels in historical works. "Copyright" is just a way to attract jade. Please Mr. Qifan talk about it again.</p>

<p>— Cai Niansun</p>
<p>A-Xing slightly raised his head, secretly looking at the master who was smoking on the opposite side: The master tilted half of his head, facing the screen door, with the cigarette pipe blocked in his mouth, his thick lips laboriously buzzing, puffing and puffing. The paper was spinning on the cigarette pipe head, and the red flames reflected the master's face full of black beard, which was really interesting. But he dared not look too much, for fear of being noticed by the master, and quickly lowered his head, shrinking his eyes back to the sleeve he was holding in his hand.</p>
<p>Mechanically, stitch by stitch, sewing; the needle jumped up and down, and his head responded. Soon, one sleeve was finished, but another dropped.</p>
<p>The master turned his head and looked at him, and he was raising his head, oh no! He quickly lowered his head.</p>
<p>The master snorted in his nostrils, followed by two thick puffs of green smoke spewing out, directly towards him. He smelled a pungent smoky smell, and turned his face outward.</p>
<p>Another snort, heavier than before, and his heart pounded. He turned his outward face back, and kept his head lowered, his ears touching his shoulders.</p>
<p>The master was still puffing and puffing. The smoke was hitting him, and he endured the pungent smoky smell, his eyes fixed on his hands, not daring to move.</p>
<p>A-Xing was afraid of the master, especially the master's "hum". A-Xing was more than familiar with the master's "hum". For the past two years, the master had "hummed" almost every day; every time he "hummed", his heart would beat, and he would be afraid, afraid that the heavy tree root ruler would fall on his head. He realized that at that time, there would be patches on his head like desolate graves in the fields, swelling high.</p>
<p>Thinking, thinking, A-Xing became even more afraid. His hands were shaking, and each stitch became dull.</p>
<p>The master shot his viper-like eyes over, and A-Xing understood the meaning of these eyes, and he became even more afraid; his heart beat violently, and his hands shook violently. While threading the needle, a needle slipped out of his hand and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>As he bent over in panic to pick up the needle, the heavy tree root ruler had already quickly fallen on his head.</p>

<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>A low, long sigh, suffocatingly exhaled from strong, broad lungs, "Fortunately, old man Zhang loves me and treats me like his son: : : : but: : : today: : : died like this, the body thrown into the river: : :</p>
<p>"Don't be sad anymore, Xiao Fang." A-Song wanted to find two words of comfort, but comfort and hope had long since left them. Trembling lips could only utter empty words of consolation.</p>
<p>"Hum!" That small face suddenly filled with angry blood. "Is this my fate? Old man Zhang is dead, and I can only watch his body being thrown into the river by others. I don't offend anyone myself, and I still have to be bullied by others sleeping on the dock: : :" "Damn it," A-Song suddenly jumped up; "Who bullied you?"</p>
<p>There was no answer, only choked sobs. Occasionally, one or two freighters shook across the river, and the night wind brought the creaking sound of the oars. Three</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the three-dimensional large building of the Jianghai Customs House put on a white hat given by the rising sun.</p>
<p>Across the river, countless factory sirens roared wildly, trams were driven by people with hazy eyes, ding-ding passed, and freight cars, flatbed cars, garbage trucks, and dung trucks ran on the road. The machinery of the city re-activated.</p>
<p>The coolies on the docks, hiding unrecovered fatigue in their muscles, sparsely rubbed their red eyes and crawled up from the floor, dragging their heavy steps and wandering on the sidewalk of the road. Greedy eyes stared at the pancakes and black noodles on the vendors' stalls; stingy hands counted the copper plates in their pockets or the bamboo signs hanging on their waists.</p>
<p>A dozen or so old freighters were docked on the riverbank, the decks had turned gray-black, and the two longitudinal timbers on the side of the ship were honeycomb-like, full of small holes poked by bamboo poles. Dung trucks were pushed by ragged old men and barefoot, disheveled women, lining up on the sidewalk next to the shore like a long snake formation. Once the car stopped, it immediately turned to face the dung boat, connected to a long, bowl-thick hollow bamboo tube, and transported the feces in the car to the boat. At the junction, yellow-green fecal juice dripped onto the cement. The dung trucks were constantly changing, and the fecal juice on the cement gradually increased, eventually converging into many small fecal ponds, the fecal juice flowed horizontally and vertically in the gaps of the cement, expanding its own</p>
<p>range, and finally converging with other yellow fecal ponds, creating a large area of feces.</p>

However, the number of machine-refined rice arrivals was large, and the quality of the goods varied. The initial prices were quite high, and by the end of the delivery, they were lowered by a small . Therefore, the difference between the high and low price disks was half a yuan. The price of machine-refined new rice ranged from $6.50, $6.30 to $6.02. The new refined rice was $5.22. This price is combined with the cost, and the machine rice must lose nearly yuan, and the refined rice also loses several yuan. Yong Gang also went to Jiangxi for 300 bags of machine-made late rice, priced at $7.36 to $7.30. This street went to Saigon No. 1 with 150 bags, priced at $7.70. Little Twist, 500 bags, priced at $6.15. This price is the same as the previous market, but under the influence of the new, the market is also watching.</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Plunge in Flour Prices is Frightening <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Each month, the price fell wildly by about . Yesterday, the flour market initially stabilized, and then gradually declined. The Chicago quotations for foreign wheat rose by about $1.10, and Canada rose by $. Therefore,</p>
<p>After the opening, people's hearts were still calm. By the time the market opened later, because the current month was closer to delivery, most of the outside long positions were painfully closed, and the buyers also stepped back, causing the market atmosphere to become dilapidated and unrecoverable. By the time the afternoon market opened, it was reported that the spot goods in Tianjin were no longer available and the price was weak, down by one minute yesterday. Therefore, the transactions of the buyers all returned, and the factories also successively issued files for the distant period. As a result, the market atmosphere became more and more tired. The lowest price in the current month was $2.23, and a new record was set. As far as the current situation is concerned, the low level of two corners may have to be seen in the current month, and it is not known. As a result, the current month fell sharply by about two and a half points compared with the previous week, the September fell by two points and two and a half cents, the October fell by one point and seven and a half cents, the November fell by two points, the December fell by one point and seven and a half cents, and the January fell by one point and a half cents.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Wheat Sales Were Smooth <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The Standard Market Returned to Low</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the prices of each month were generally stable. The quotations for foreign wheat rose by $1.10 in Chicago and about in Canada. Therefore, when the prices were opened, they were initially good, but then they loosened slightly due to the soft return of the flour market. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market was still not good, and the exchange had already inspected the delivered wheat, and it was heard that it had reached more than 20 cars (the number of inspectors was more than 100 cars). Therefore, the hearts of each month were again turned down. As far as the current limited sales of flour are concerned, the future of the wheat market is not good. As a result, the current month was slightly more than one point, the September was slightly more than two points, the October and November were slightly more than four points, and the December was slightly more than three points. The cash wheat market saw smooth transactions. The asking prices for high-quality goods were still strong, and the average price for medium-quality goods was $3.87 for Qingjiang wheat, 83 cents for secondary wheat, $3.82 for black wheat, 73 cents for secondary wheat, $3.82 for Qingjiang wheat, $3.66 for Gaoyou wheat, 48 cents for secondary wheat, $3.9 for Yaowan wheat, 70 cents for secondary wheat, $3.53 for Zhuzhen wheat, $3.9 for Wuhe wheat, $3.2 for Nanjing wheat, with the secondary wheat being between and one point. $3.15 for Bianjiang wheat, $3.12 for Wuhu wheat, $3.6 for Yangzhou wheat, $3.83 for Jiangyan wheat, 74 cents for secondary wheat, $3.6 for Taizhou wheat, $3.98 for Nansu wheat. Fuxin handled 9,000 bags, and Huafeng handled 6,000 bags.</p>

<p>Today, all sesame-producing areas have reported bumper crops, and the products are also excellent. Yesterday, 12 bags of new white sesame seeds from Yangzhou were transported to the market. The goods were very good. This transaction was for new goods and could not be used as a positive market. It is feared that the market will be difficult to stand up in the future, because new goods are gradually coming on the market, and there are still 30,000 old goods in stock, but the sales channels are still few. Therefore, although the price has fallen by $45 compared to the highest peak, the market still lacks the power to recover.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was still relatively stable. The association's split plate of 24 rough sand white ordinary goods was still priced at $20.85, the original price. The price of transit goods was 7.9 Dutch guilders (foreign tax). 20 high-grade medium sand white P mark was $20.4. 20 18 unified goods were $20.15. Dutch red KD goods are still scarce at $17. Raw sand red was $18.7. Taikoo sugar prices lacked ups and downs. B mark was $21.43, and DY mark was $20.85. The Guangchao Gang Haojia opened 200 bags of Hainan red, and the price rose to $15.3. 200+bags of Chaoqing, Ti Zhuangqing was $15.6, and then $15.3 to $15. The market seems to be turning stable.</p>

<p>Since the new black melon seeds came out, the market price has gradually fallen, and the cheapness of the sales plate has been the only one in history. Now it is heard that there are recent floods, and the price is gradually tightening. Therefore, if the floods are successful in the future, there will be huge ups and downs. It can be asserted that the current market price of Shangzhuang Jikui seeds is $16.00, and then from $15.00 to $13.00. Inferior goods are not more than $10, which is still a low price. Those who are concerned should pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Shaoxing autumn all on the cluster as a cocoon Shaoxing various cities and townships this year's autumn silkworm rearing number is not less than spring Silkworms, unfortunately, mulberry trees do not produce much leaves, resulting in more silkworms and fewer leaves, and the price of leaves is extremely high. The early gangs have already been on the cluster as the first new cocoon to be listed soon. In the evening, the price of leaves is already $3.3 and $4.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Construction Department discussed and decided on the price of autumn cocoons. The president of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Zeng, called a meeting of representatives from the silk and cocoon industry to discuss and decide on the price of this year's autumn silkworm cocoons. The price of improved species is still $40 as the standard, and it must not be increased or decreased without authorization.</p>
<p>Artificial silk customer sales continued to have a flat price, and yesterday, from the Yanqing Gang, the black beauty unicorns head No. 2 red fish and other brands of August and September futures, 42 boxes, were entered at a net beat of $181.25 to $170.75.</p>
<p>Fazhuang took the opportunity to replenish the factory's lack of goods.

<p>As it is the beginning of autumn and the weather is turning cooler, the woolen cloth market is gradually becoming more active. In particular, tailors who make Western-style clothing started preparations earlier. Therefore, these customers are now purchasing various types of woolen fabrics for Western suits in advance, including popular varieties such as Walter cloth, serge, Melton plain thick cloth, flannel, and shoe felt. Customers from Chongqing are also making purchases, but those from Jiangxi and other inland areas are not buying in large quantities. It is predicted that the peak sales period for woolen cloth will be around the time of the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

These prices are all three to four jiao higher than before. However, the market stock has become scarce after purchases by various groups.

<h3 id="e234">On Poverty <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>In this era when the groans of unemployment resonate loudly throughout our distorted and contradictory society, everyone is qualified to talk about "poverty." In my hometown, there are two common sayings: "Better poor than stinky," which is a complaint from the poor, and "Better poor than fierce," which is a sympathetic yet concerned remark from creditors to their debtors.</p>
<p>"Poverty" is indeed the most terrifying thing. In this world where one cannot stand without money, there is truly no room for the poor to survive. Yet, this strange world is filled with the poor, so "poverty" has become a global issue.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe that if a person's small diary has never included a period of "poverty," then their life must be empty and unfulfilling. "Poverty" is not only without shame, but also a stimulating experience. It is like a blazing fire, igniting people's activities and passion for upward mobility. It can compel people to open their eyes wide and see through the ailments of the world, and prompt them to prescribe a "targeted" remedy for this sick world. Furthermore, it can enable people to use their own strength to create many great and astonishing achievements! As for those who steal, rob, or even commit suicide because of "poverty," they are merely shameful displays of individualists without true perspectives or principles, and the most unpromising of the weak.</p>
<h3 id="e235">A Record of Visiting the Eastern Palace <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Miaoshen</p>
<p>One day, introduced by Sister Quan, I visited the girls' dormitory of a certain school in this city, the famous Eastern Palace. Afterwards, I found it quite enjoyable. I think many people must sigh in vain, unable to enter due to the strictness of the palace.</p>
<p>Now I will write some of it out for everyone to daydream about.</p>
<p>Upon entering the palace gate, a delicate melody drifted from afar. Listening carefully, it seemed neither like a zither nor a reed pipe. Later, I learned it was a foreign violin. Inside the palace, there were three thousand beauties, each lively and graceful. Some were playing tennis, others were chatting in groups of three or two on the lawn, each with a smiling face, as beautiful and charming as flowers!</p>
<p>Inside the dormitory, all the beds were uniform steel wire beds with tidy bedding, which was quite orderly. However, the fruit peels on the floor were messy, some were chocolate wrappers, and others were melon seed shells, which was not clean at all.</p>
<p>The Collective Phenomenon - Cheng Xiyuan</p>
<p>Almost everyone had some decorations around their bed. Some hung photos of themselves in charming poses; some pasted photos of Chinese and Western movie stars; and some even drew a beautiful schedule and pasted it next to their bed. Everyone's arrangement was unique and quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Under each person's bed, almost everyone had a pair of beautiful, fashionable leather shoes hidden. It is said that these shoes are only worn on Sundays.</p>
<p>Besides books and lecture notes, there were also many movie brochures piled on the desks. Some people even kept these brochures as a collection on their desks.</p>
<p>Female students mostly love to decorate themselves, but I didn't see many cosmetics. According to Sister Quan, because the school authorities forbid it, everyone hid their cosmetics. Each month, the maids take out countless bottles and jars of various cosmetics!</p>
<p>I saw a few people writing very seriously. I said to Sister Quan, "They are very diligent." Sister Quan smiled and said, "They are writing letters. Here, writing letters is more important than reading lecture notes."</p>
<p>It is said that Ms. X is the "queen" of this school. Sister Quan said, "She has extensive social connections and is very capable. Would you like to meet her?" I said, "Okay." After Sister Quan introduced me, I saw that she was indeed beautiful with delicate features. Ms. X was very friendly, and we hit it off immediately. After exchanging names, I asked her:</p>
<p>"You have extensive social connections and are still studying, which shows that you have extraordinary energy. Some people say that just reading books is useless, and one must go into society to personally experience and observe. Is that why you do so well?"</p>
<p>Ms. X smiled slightly and said, "Socializing is certainly indispensable for a person, and society is something no one can live without. However, if socializing becomes too busy, it can also interfere with one's studies, so I am now a bit tired of socializing."</p>
<p>This was truly unexpected. Ms. X, known for her social skills, actually said such a thing.</p>
<p>"I heard that you are the most socially skilled person here, so you must have a very clear understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of socializing. However, in my opinion, the most troublesome and harmful thing during the study period is socializing with the opposite sex!" Ms. X said very frankly, "That's right! I think some men are the most annoying. They are obstacles to our future, the enemies of us women, making us sacrifice! For example, some people say that I am the 'queen' of this school. This is entirely the result of men toying with me, and the reason is that I socialize too much, and they all know me."</p>
<p>"So, you really hate socializing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I really hate socializing, and I even dislike men somewhat!"</p>
<p>At this point, because it was getting late, Sister Quan called me to go back together. Ms. X even saw us off to the door.</p>

<p>— Mengfei</p>
<p>A beautiful woman alone in her fragrant room. Leaning lazily on the cool bed with a charming face. Her eyes are drowsy, still weary. She yawns repeatedly, languidly. Her jade bracelets are crystal clear green. Reflecting the snowy white skin, as white as frost. Her delicate figure is like a fresh flower. Like a peony in the rain, a begonia in spring. She opens her mouth, calling for her maidservant. Wanting to wash and dress with fragrant water. In a flash, a young maid walks in. Pouring water and brewing tea, serving busily. She gets up, washes, and applies rouge and powder. Instantly, the whole room smells fragrant. In the bronze mirror, her beautiful face shines. It shines so brightly that even the slightest flaw disappears. She feels tired after dressing up. Smoking a Baijinlong cigarette, she walks to the window. Next to her, she turns on the electric fan. Instantly, a cool breeze sweeps over her body. She instructs to turn on the radio. Listening quietly to records, full of joy. Some sing Shanghai opera. Some sing comic dialogues. Some sing Peking opera. Some sing Kunqu opera. Nothing but northern and southern tunes. When it sounds good, she smiles slightly. When she hears something funny, she scolds lightly. She rests calmly, feeling at ease. A servant girl brings in bird's nest soup. A bowl of white fungus with added sugar. In the afternoon, she invites her sisters. Playing mahjong in the Central Wind White Board room. When night comes, she feels hot. Riding a motorcycle to enjoy the cool breeze. This is also a natural blessing, surpassing the ordinary.</p>

<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man A: But you can't say it that way either. In today's world, there is no one who doesn't want money, and besides, if the army doesn't get paid for several months, they still have to eat. How can you expect them not to help themselves?</p>
<p>Old Man: But no matter what, it's wrong to make the common people pay. If they don't get paid, they can ask the officers, why take it out on us?</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man C: That's right. Last year, the army in the county town rioted over pay and killed several officers.</p>
<p>(The sound of a car approaching.)</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man B: Listen! What's that sound?</p>
<p>Old Woman: Oh no! That's not good, the damn planes are coming again.</p>
<p>Old Man: Really? Then we better run!</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man B: No, it's not a plane.</p>
<p>Old Man: Where's the sound coming from? How come I can't hear anything? Ah! Old people are really useless, sometimes they can't even hear thunder.</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man C: (Standing on the pile of wood to the right of the stage) It's a car. Look at the dust. There are two cars, I wonder what they're carrying?</p>
<p>(The sound of the car gets closer and closer, and everyone curiously runs to the left of the stage. Only the Old Man and Middle-aged Man A are still standing in place, looking to the left. Then they hear the sound of the car's horn, and it stops to the left of the stage, but the audience cannot see it. Then there is a clamor of voices. They only hear someone saying:)</p>
<p>Voice: Okay, let's stop here for a while. Voice: Oh! Oh! It hurts so much. Child: (Squeezing out from the crowd) Ah! So scary! It's all dead bodies, it's terrifying. The dead bodies are covered with wounded soldiers, all bloody. It's so scary.</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man A: How many are there?</p>
<p>Voice: Aren't there two full cars? Who knows how many there are.</p>
<p>(A junior officer wearing a Red Cross armband comes on stage, looks around to the front, back, left, and right. Then he goes off stage.)</p>
<p>Old Man: Ah! So many dead bodies again. Even if China doesn't perish, it will die out from so many deaths.</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man A: The fighting at the front has been fierce these past few days, almost every day they are transporting wounded soldiers and dead bodies. Old Woman: Heavens! What's going on? Living people sitting on dead bodies, shouting in pain, even if they don't die from the pain, they'll be scared to death.</p>
<p>Old Man: What can we do? So many are wounded, and so many have died.</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man C: It's terrible, all the dead bodies stink.</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man B: It makes you want to vomit. Voice: (The officer of the ambulance team. Hereafter referred to as the military doctor.) Carry all the wounded soldiers to the open space in front of the temple gate. Put the dead in one car, and the living in the other car. Old Man: (The military doctor comes on, the old man asks.) Sir! Where did they come from? Military Doctor: (Looks at him, as if not wanting to answer. Then shouts to the left of the stage:) Hurry up! Are you listening? Move all those who are not dead to this place.</p>
<p>Old Woman: But are you going to make them sleep on the ground? There's not even a bit of straw to be pitied. (Two orderlies carry two wounded soldiers on a stretcher. When the wounded soldiers are placed on the ground, they let out agonizing cries. Middle-aged Man C also helps a lightly wounded person up and lets them sit next to the old man. People look at the wounded soldiers with sympathy and examine their wounds.) Old Man: (Speaking to him at his side) Comrade, where are you hurt? Wounded Soldier A: My leg is hurt, I'm afraid the bone is broken.</p>
<p>Orderly: (Carrying more people up) Broken bone? You can still walk with a broken bone? What are you bragging about? Wounded Soldier B: Oh my god! Oh! My god! Can someone kind give me some water to drink? Mom! It hurts so much!</p>
<p>Military Doctor: What's all the noise about? Wounded Soldier B: Mom! I can't see you anymore, I'm going to die. Oh!</p>
<p>Old Woman: (Wiping her eyes, she says) I'll go I'll go get some water for him. It's really pitiful.</p>

<h3 id="e240">About the Screenplay of HinPIeWeKes (Part 2) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Bofu</p>
<p>Film Translation Title: "The Way of Independence"</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in the character of this daughter, the author depicts for us a modern woman with perseverance, brains, and autonomy, breaking the ingrained concepts of sex and the traditional moral ideology. This is exactly the natural development of women as depicted by Ibsen. However, whether a working girl in a remote village in the northern part of England twenty years ago would have such a mindset is indeed questionable. On this point, it must be said that the author, like Ibsen, has an overly romantic color.</p>
<p>However, this play is still worth rereading today, twenty years later. This is not because the author wrote a romantic new woman for us, but because the author's character portrayal depicts a typical capitalist and other characters.</p>
<p>The daughter's struggle is naturally against traditional concepts and ingrained morals, and the person representing this ideology is the father of the young master, a factory owner. He and the daughter's father both started as workers, but after ten years, he has become a millionaire, while the daughter's father is still a worker and has to work in his factory. The contrast between the characters of these two old men is really well depicted. One controls his son with an iron fist, while the other cannot even control his daughter and is even bullied by his wife. The difference in their characters determines their fate in that kind of society. As for the individualistic nature of capitalists, it is even more vividly displayed in the character of this factory owner. He tells his wife that the reason why he works so hard to make money is not because money can buy a wealthy life, but because money is power. So he buys a car for his son, not to show off, but to make people say that his son can afford a car. He also says that his son can spend as much as he wants, but he has to ask him for it. Especially when he finds out about his son's matter, the attitude he takes shows his character even more. Contrasting his character is the future father-in-law of his son. He is also a capitalist, but he is an extreme egoist, the kind of rich and unkind person often seen in Chinese movies. However, the son's father, in addition to wanting to be a rich person, also has ambitions, he also wants to single-handedly support the society they have created. Therefore, he is willing to fight to the death against any moral law that endangers this society. These people are the backbone of the capitalist society. The author was originally from Lancaster, with practical experience, so he was very successful in depicting this kind of person.</p>
<p>Most of the power of this play lies in the dialogue, but the words spoken by the characters are all accented. We already found it difficult when reading the script, and if it were made into a movie, I'm afraid it would be even more difficult to understand. But knowing the origin of this play makes it worth watching. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e241">Review of "Shotgun Pass" <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Shotgun Pass</p>
<p>It's definitely not an exaggeration to say that Columbia Pictures productions are often disappointing. This is naturally because the producers place too much emphasis on low-level interests. Because of this, they have extracted a lot of money from the masses who have few opportunities to see movies and who have a relatively low level of knowledge. From this point of view, the entrepreneurs of this company may be very proud. But as far as the art of film itself is concerned, no matter from what standpoint, every production should not be made in a crude and shoddy manner. Even when catering to low-level interests, one should try to enrich the content as much as possible, while striving for simplicity in form. On the one hand, it is necessary to make them understand, but on the other hand, it is also necessary to give the audience a good education. Therefore, we cannot equate vulgarity and shallowness with being interesting, nor can we necessarily make them all understandable. Taking this film as an example, the two Shanghainese people sitting behind me were probably very interested in this kind of "one man with a gun" stuff. When they saw Ding Maigai fighting in the village hotel, they only heard one of them say: "This film is nothing!" Later, Ding Maigai found a clump of mud on a rock in the mountains, with traces of belt buckles and bullets on it, and therefore knew that his enemies had ambushed him on this rock, so he took this clump of mud as evidence. But at this point, the two friends behind me couldn't understand, and the one who was speaking kept asking: "Why? Why?" The one answering could only say: "I don't understand either." Therefore, it can be seen that this kind of film still has a lot of gaps for them. As for the content, then this kind of martial arts film will undoubtedly not give them a good impression. The character played by Ding Maigai, for the revenge of his father's death, for the theft of the horses, because he is his own villain, he showed the power of a traitor, punishing the violent and eliminating the evil, and fighting fiercely. That kind of hero from "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" is not only laughable, but the chaotic state of no organization and no discipline is giving them a bad lesson. Therefore, I think that if such films continue to be screened "one set after another", many "bloody" "low-level"</p>
<p>friends will definitely run to the mountains to become Robin Hoods who rob the rich and help the poor.</p>
<p>However, then again, when the thing called film is still used as the best production tool by entrepreneurs, it cannot become a tool for educating the masses as we wish. Therefore, it determines that people engaged in culture have an even more important task than criticizing films at the moment.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects of this film, then I think it's just a lot of horses running back and forth on the screen, and there's nothing to talk about in terms of technique.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e242">"Vigor" Short Commentary <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Chun</p>
<p>Under this fitting theme, an engaging story unfolds. The protagonist of the play, Li Peilan, viewed through the lens of China's economic structure, is a typical urban housewife. Her family's livelihood depends entirely on her husband's clever financial transactions. From our intuitive observation, it goes without saying that such women are complete idlers; besides readily available enjoyment, they are inherently lazy. This prevalent phenomenon of women's decline is a serious problem for Chinese women. However, we should not be pessimistic about the future of women because of this. In recent years, haven't social scientists been giving enthusiastic guidance? But theory is theory; without concrete and vivid stimulation, the women's movement remains in a state of slow progress.</p>
<p>Now, we urgently need various cultural sectors to provide opportunities for discussing this issue. After watching "Vigor," I feel that it has provided a clear and insightful answer to this bleak problem of women. It picks out a typical female figure, "Li Peilan," from among the thousands of women groping in the dark; this woman is not a superhuman but a character who seizes opportunities for self-realization.</p>
<p>We see in her the determination to escape perilous circumstances and an unwavering will. With hardship, she uses her delicate hands to accomplish great things, founding a sewing factory with the aim of providing relief to unemployed women, not to exploit the sweat and blood of workers, but to realize their "self-sufficiency."</p>
<p>Seen in this way, we can say that Li Peilan is a new woman with social consciousness.</p>
<p>Of course, this performance of "Vigor" will provide a great impetus for the Chinese women's movement. (Chapter missing)</p>
<h3 id="e243">My Thoughts After Watching "Vigor" <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xiumei</p>
<p>Shao Zuiweng's past directorial works, apart from "Yunlan Girl," have rarely been surprisingly contributory. Now, after watching "Vigor," I feel that Shao Zuiweng has progressed compared to before.</p>
<p>"Vigor"'s directing technique has gained new achievements, and the use of contrast is also very clever. The advertisement says it is Shao Zuiweng's masterpiece of changing his style. Although the words "masterpiece" may be an exaggeration, the "change of style" is real.</p>
<p>Just from the title "Vigor," we can see how full of vitality it is. The development of the story, from beginning to end, tells a group of women how to be independent, how to strive, and not to rely on men, not to be playthings of men, but to work hard and diligently, and there will be hope of success in the future. Li Peilan is an example. At the same time, it also has a profound depiction of the darkness of modern society and the snobbery of human relationships.</p>
<p>But the film also has many shortcomings, such as Li Peilan hitting a gangster with an ashtray, and the gangster falling to the ground in response and lying motionless. In reason, this would not happen. After Wu Daqing went bankrupt, when he went to find Li Peilan, the slogans posted on the road seemed to be aimed specifically at Wu, and there were no other pedestrians on the road except Wu, which is also not very reasonable. Also, Wu Daqing's living room seems too grand and magnificent, because Daqing is just a small bourgeois, and he would not live in such a large building.</p>
<p>The sound and cinematography is average. The light is a bit too soft in some places, but it is not a major flaw. This film and Lianhua's "The Light of Motherhood" are both successful works of domestic films. (Chapter missing)</p>

<p>— Yu Jian</p>
<p>(Above omitted) The compilation of the story, it cannot be denied, has found a fresh theme. However, I always feel that there are still many places that are not enough. I think perhaps the screenwriter deliberately did it this way, because if it wasn't written this way, it wouldn't have gotten such a good ending. The screenwriter is probably aware of the other insufficiencies, but due to various restrictions, he had no choice but to say, "Let it be."</p>
<p>The sound is very clear, which adds a lot to the film. However, there seem to be a few too many songs.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was due to the limitations of the story or something else, but I feel that the performances of each actor were just average, although I didn't feel that anyone acted "too badly." In this film, Chen Yumei can be considered hardworking, but I don't think she was particularly brilliant.</p>
<p>The scenery is well-matched. The cinematography is not bad, and there are a few clever shots that are really admirable.</p>
<p>One thing is that some places feel incoherent. Of course, intricate interlacing is indispensable. But reaching a point of incoherence is not a good phenomenon. Although this film did not leave a deep impression on me, it already has a good tendency, which I cannot deny. This point made me feel quite happy when I lay in bed. (Chapter missing)</p>
<h3 id="e245">Commentary on "Vigor" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Dai Dai</p>
<p>The results of "Vigor" seem to have improved compared to Tianyi's previous productions, and the sound is also quite clear. A special commentary is as follows:</p>
<p>The protagonist, Chen Yumei, plays Li Peilan, a woman struggling in an adverse environment. At first, her performance of being oppressed, and hearing her husband Wu Daqing's sleep talking, "frowning and pondering," and "suspicions arising" are very appropriate to her role. Later, the plot turns tense when she is indignant at her unvirtuous husband and takes her son back to her mother's home. From this scene onwards, Chen Yumei's performance method also takes a sharp turn, becoming extremely resolute and brave. From beginning to end, it is wonderful and powerful. Overall, Chen Yumei's performance in "Vigor" is the most successful.</p>
<p>In terms of supporting roles, Yuan Meiyun's performance as Li Peilan's sister is very good, but unfortunately, there are very few performance opportunities. But she also sang two songs, "A Butterfly and a Bee" and "Little Baby," which were still graceful and pleasant to listen to. Zhang Zhenduo's Wu Daqing, in the first half, performs the absurd behavior of a general small bourgeois. Some of his actions seem too frivolous. In the second half, his performance of the frustration and suffering after "bankruptcy" and the diligence and sincerity after being taken in by Li Peilan is better. Lu Xia plays Wu Daqing's mistress, Lao San, and her performance is quite hardworking, but it is a bit too much. Others, such as Wang Huijuan, Ye Qiuxin, Ma Dongwu, Zhu Tianhong, etc., all play their roles in this film competently. Generally speaking, there are no major flaws. The director has small cleverness, and the contrast is excellent. The cinematography is average.</p>

<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>She said to Xue Lidan, "Please rest assured. I will definitely do my best to satisfy you." She then asked Xue in a very soft voice why he was so good to her. Xue Lidan said that one day he would tell her, but now was not the time for her to understand. Their eyes met, and they were silently speechless. I smiled slightly. Xue Lidan looked at her with deep affection, then bowed and withdrew.</p>
<p>The play opened, and I, Lu Lanse, took to the stage to perform. Xue Lidan stood backstage, clutching a handful of sweat, afraid to breathe as he watched. Tears filled his eyes, and he didn't know what the taste in his throat was. It wasn't until the curtain fell that applause like thunder filled the theater. The curtain rose again, and I bowed to receive the respect of the entire audience. This happened several times until the applause gradually subsided. Then he squeezed to the back, where it was already full of people congratulating and admiring her. He finally approached her, took her hand, and stared at her without saying a word. Then he lowered his head and kissed her forehead, saying, "I!" I asked with shame, "Do you really like me?" Xue Lidan said, "Your performance was too superb." I asked him what Yishidun thought. Xue Lidan told her that Yishidun was so happy because her performance was unexpected that he was going crazy. He would come to negotiate the contract in a moment. The drama critic Lawrence also came to congratulate her. He said that he had already telegraphed his newspaper, preparing many good adjectives to use. Lawrence left, and I and Xue Lidan were overjoyed, because Lawrence was a famous sharp tongue on Broadway, and he usually didn't say good things about people. Then Yishidun came. He took her hand and said, "My dear, I really have no words to say. You are a miracle. I've been in the theater for so many years, this is my happiest night." After Yishidun finished speaking, he blamed himself, saying that he had never given her a chance before. He was so sorry for her that he was ashamed. I comforted him instead, telling him not to talk about the past. Yishidun gradually felt more at ease. He told her that from now on, she would be under the protection of his career. He added, "This is all business." I followed him and said, "It's all business," feeling very sad in my heart. Would the old wounds in my heart never heal? The door rang again, and Haijiesi stuck his head in and asked, "May I come in?" I couldn't say anything at the time and just nodded to him. Haijiesi came in, and I said to the three of them, "You three are the benefactors who made me famous, and I will repay you in the future so that you will not be disappointed in me." Haijiesi looked at her deeply, then said very sincerely, "You should say that a little slower." Then he explained a reason. (To be continued)</p>
