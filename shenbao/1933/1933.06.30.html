<h3 id="c23">東北艦隊離靑實 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>東北艦隊即以前之渤海艦隊。其所屬之海圻海琛等艦原具革命歷史吳佩孚氏稱覇時代。由溫樹德率海圻等主要艦艇北去。吳氏敗後乃移於東北。受張作霖之節制。沈鴻烈旋繼溫氏爲該艦隊司令。及至國民革命軍統一南北。關外懸靑白旗。該艦隊名義始統一於中央。此次鴻烈遇剌後海圻等五艦突然駛離防區。據報紙所傳。沈氏遇剌前。各艦長以不滿於沈氏簿待其部下之故。曾有某種聨合之擬議。剌沈不中後。又對沈氏個人發通牒。提出沈氏即時下野。由前參謀長代司令。釋放剌沈嫌疑犯。并發淸三個月欠餉等四項之要求。故以此事之表面觀之。似純屬該艦隊内部事。由部下不滿於其司令個人問題而起。然而實際上是否如是簡單。是否無其他政治背景。我人在眞相未明以前。殊未敢輕於置喙。</p>
<p>惟吾人就事實上論。當此國難嚴重。强敵伺𨻶之際。舉凡公務人員。不論其職位之大小。事務之輕重。皆當以身獻國。在此非常時期中。除一致應敵而外。不應有其他個人問題之意見。况陸海軍隊。同在中央政府領導指揮之下。爲保衛國家之前線戰士。就一般敎育論。程度較高。所負任務又純爲國防。皆應略識世界狀况與我國令日情勢。我國外爲强隣窺伺。其欲借端在華北製造禍亂。以便乘機奪取。已爲不可掩飾之事實。而彼陰狠之僞國。亦不惜使用任何卑劣手段。以破壞我國土。故勾引我海軍投降僞國之傳說。早已喧傳人口。吾人固不敢謂此次東北艦隊之行動。受何方面勾結。然在此國家危險之際。海軍將校。應認明自身之立塲。行動宜正大。態度宜光明。今日縱有不得已之苦衷。而一時自由行動。但異日要必有以可告我國人者。而後可以釋我國人之疑若不幸而此種暗昧舉動。竟如悠悠之口之揣測。而併無重大理由可以告我國人。則我甚爲東北艦隊惜也。</p>
<p>如其目的而僅在驅逐沈鴻烈也。驅沈目的。而僅在欠餉與薄待部下也。則在事前應列舉沈氏罪狀。以呼訴於中央。靜聽中央之公正處置。今旣不出此。而貿然自由行動駛離靑島矣。則駛離靑島之後。應速自嚴加約朿。勿再有所盲動。沈果不利衆口。則中央自有適當之處置。抑以該艦隊之歷史言之。勃海艦隊。自前次離粤北上而後。即受東北當局之指揮。雖經北伐統一。表面服從中央。而實際自另成一統系。對沈自易引起分裂。然今日東北之地。已被强敵攫去。東北之名。又已統屬於中央。則該艦隊之駛離防地。又將悵安歸。故該艦隊應覺悟自身關係之大。行動之當詳審熟慮。而中央當局。對於此事之處置。尤應以公平敏捷之手段。妥爲解决。而勿任其拖延懸宕。致生意外之枝節也。</p>

<p>倫敦今晨世界經濟大會之活動、完全爲幣價大漲落所控制、羅斯福總統之親信顧問摩萊敎授今日開始活動、而與美代表團商談通貨穏定問題、其他各國之代表團亦各自集議、其中主要者、爲歐洲金本位國集團之會議、麥唐納與張伯倫所引導之英代表團、現竭力疏通各方意見、惟彼等現覺宣布使英鎊與黄金相呼應、則將陷美國於孤立地位、而經濟大會勢將整個瓦解、再則、用金國現深慮鎊價將爲美元抑低、果爾、則用金國之商業將受極不利之影響也、通貨問題刻在頓挫之中、大會許多工作、實際已因此中止進行、美代表團現尙未被牽入正式討論、惟進行情形、均隨時告之、據最近消息、法財長龐萊將提出建議、如不能於一星期内告成通貨穏定之妥協、則大會應宣告延會云、聞此說非全無因、麥唐納今日復會晤赫爾、請其注意局勢之嚴重、據傳美代表團已因此電致羅斯福總統、建議於其視爲適當之時急、宜作一切實宣言、但當局旋發表否認文、同時貨幣金融委員會主席考克斯復聲明拒絶討論通貨穏定事、並勸歐人自覔解决之道、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦在世界經濟大會中謀取一般通貨穏定者、今見美元之迅速下趨、至爲惶慮、歐洲用金國之代表一面聲稱擁護金本位、一面包圍英相麥唐納、欲得英國之援助、但除取得英相優惠的注意之諾言外、别無成就、英政府似不欲在美國與歐洲用金國間之衝突中有所偏袒、且見美元波動之狂驟、尤不願有何舉動、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦法國在實際上對於經濟會議、發一哀的美頓書、警告貨幣安定協定苟不能於一星期内締成、則法代表將提議無限期休會、惟法國雖有哀的美頓書、英國亦有加入歐陸金本位國之傾向、而美國仍堅守其原來政策、拒絶在此時參加任何安定協定、</p>
<p>法國哀的美頓書係送致會議主席麥唐納、聞各主要國家代表在迭次私人談話時所有金本位防衛同盟、其他與盟國如意·比荷蘭·瑞士等皆贊同此舉、</p>
<p>今日下午聞悉法人哀的美頓書尙係昨日送出、今日美代表因此重申其拒絶安定之立塲、於是會議中人莫不憂形於色、蓋若輩前曾揣測美金如此猛跌不已、殆美總統已有考慮安定幣價之意、初不料美代表仍作拒絶聲明也、</p>
<p>金本位國代表如法財長龐萊·比外相希孟·瑞士及意荷代表等今晨遂開秘密會議、旣而又與英相麥唐納財相張伯倫會晤、惟兩次會商俱未有具體結果、法財長龐納於會晤英共表後曾向記者表示未能有進步、但謂今日下午將再行集議、美代表團聞法國有哀的美頓書消息後亦語記者云、本日爲會議最黑暗之日、自美國拒絶重行考慮其關於安定政策後草擬貨幣計畫之六大國代表原定今晨開會、現亦爲之展緩、因咸認欲在此時繼續討論防免幣價漲落之方案無益於事也、今日午後會議休息室内盛傳英相麥唐納業以個人名義致雷美總統、懇其顧全會議在可能範圍内儘速採取趨向安定美金之步驟、現信英相此種非常舉動、係法國今晨重申昨日所送哀的美敦書之結果、又聞金本位國家今晨會議時、比代表佛蘭克最爲激烈、宣稱除非援助比人維持金本位、比國唯有退出會議一途可行耳、此外各代表亦咸表示、此時亟有回國應付日益危急金融局勢之需要、惟英國現已切實傾向於金本位國、英代表團昨夜曾致文會議秘書處、力言制止貨幣投機的漲落之必要、</p>
<p>至美國對於安定問題不變態度之聲明、係美國務副卿摩萊與美代表團顧問著名金融家華堡美財部顧問史普拉格會議兩小時後發表、據美代表團發言人聲稱、美金在最近之將來、尙無事實上安定之望、惟承認史普拉格在其時期内或將送呈新計畫於美總統、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<p>倫敦邇來美國金元續跌不已、英國與若干國家曾藉貶落幣價而氏獲得貿易利益者、莫不大起恐慌、深慮將蒙重大損失、因此法代表團遂乘機拉攏英國、提議先行安定金鎊佛郎匯價、俾可結成歐洲聨合陣線一致對美、昨夜曾有種種誘致英國加入歐洲貨幣計劃之提議、並有請英國贊助金本位國家者、就今日情形而觀、多信英國倘願用其穏定鎊價基金扶助佛郎、則法蘭西銀行將可援助荷蘭貨幣、如此可將歐洲主要各國貨幣安定於較有伸縮性之基礎上、而阻免金元之再跌、現美代表團對此種種提議尙無表示、而法代表團則堅信非俟美國贊同某種安定計劃後、無論在經濟或貨幣上任何問題、終不能獲得切實協定云、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c125">靑島海軍風潮五艦駛廟島說 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>本埠海軍方面所探得消息</p>
<p>倒沈係鄂派與江浙派之爭</p>
<p>國聞社云、靑島海軍發生倒沈運動、海圻海琛肇和等五艦、於刺沈兇手馮志中槍决後、竟不奉命、擅自駛離靑島、明白提出要求、詳情業誌報端、昨日、記者向本埠海軍方面探詢所得消息如次、</p>
<h3 id="c126">開去廟島 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>據談、靑島海軍之海圻·海琛·肇和·鎭海·楚豫·五艘、駛離靑島、刻聞已去廟島、（在蓬萊縣口外）惟廟島荒蕪、駛彼用意何在、不得而知、五艦雖傳艦長登岸、似有由下級長官主動、决不致全體登岸、總有一二艦長在内、公同動作、苟此次係士兵行動、連下級長官登陸、則其艦必不能駛行矣、</p>
<h3 id="c127">派别之爭 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>至於靑島海軍、係由東北艦隊脫出、最近閩籍粤籍人員已頗少、魯籍亦均被陶汰、大多爲湖北派與江浙派、司令沈鴻烈、參謀長兼海圻艦長凌宵、雖同屬淸委湖北海軍班保送留日生、但沈籍鄂、凌籍蘇、且此次凌氏之海圻參與倒沈運動、故一般人均認此次風潮、係湖北派與江浙派之爭、</p>
<h3 id="c128">决不降僞 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>現五艦旣去廟席島、預測在該處暫時駐　、以待調停者之　　、降僞係過敏之談、蓋大半士官　屬、盡在鄂魯江浙數省、至去粤則更難、因中央海軍横阻其間、且煤水不足、没有接濟、欲長途不停、其困難亦正多、</p>
<h3 id="c129">實方一斑 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>靑島海軍所有艦艇、爲海圻·海琛·肇和·楚豫·鎭海·定海·江利·同安·威海·等九艘、除海圻海琛肇和楚豫較有實力、此外鎭海定海、係由商輪改造、今較大、此外鎭海圻變走、其他竟毫無實力、茲錄其實力如下表、</p>

<p>防汛經費已撥六十萬元</p>
<p>東北艦隊風潮不致擴大</p>
<p>中央社云、行政院秘書長褚民誼氏、昨晨由京到滬、辦理中法學校招生事宜、定於今晚搭乘夜車返京、中央社記者、昨晨往訪褚氏、詢以记水工作及東北艦隊風潮等各項問題、當承詳爲答復如下、</p>
<h3 id="c131">中央注意防水工作 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>據褚氏談、中央對於防水工作、異常重視、業已訓令財政部撥付防汎經費六十萬元、以作保護長提等各項工作之需、關於防水工作、以揚子江水道整理委員會爲中心機關、該會委員長周象賢氏業已飛往九江、决將常川駐潯、以便兼顧上下之防水工作、行政院亦已訓令各省當局嚴行防水、經費除由各省自行籌劃外、中央將酌予補助、每年八月爲水位最高之季、今年六月江水特别高漲、較諸二十年六月中之水位、超過多尺、此後如挑洩順利、即至八月中江水再漲、亦可望不致成災矣、</p>
<h3 id="c132">東北艦隊發生風潮 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>靑島市長、兼東北艦隊司令沈鴻烈氏、被刺受驚、中央曾電慰問、海圻海琛肇和等五艦離靑、原係反對沈氏、純屬人的問題、外傳將歸附僞國之說不確、中央對於此次風潮迄未接到詳細報告、亦未接到沈氏之辭呈、報載沈氏已電中央辭本兼各職之說、亦非確詞、中央須待接到詳細報告之後、再行處理、事態可望不致擴大、</p>
<h3 id="c133">石叚赴港結果圓滿 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>石瑛叚錫朋兩氏、此次赴港、係屬代表汪院長解釋一切誤會、古叚兩氏已於前日返京報告、結果頗爲圓滿、甫由海外歸來之陳銘樞氏、最近期内允即入京、香港電傳中央將任陳陳銘樞氏主粤、石叚兩氏此去係徵詢意見之說、純屬政客所放之謠言、企圖挑撥離間、純非確詞、黄部長何日北返、尙未定期、</p>

<p>察哈爾問題、近日又起變化、原因頗爲複雜、中央對於察局、仍交華北當局處理、可望和平解决、孫殿英氏現任靑海西區屯墾督辦、命令業已發表、孫氏對於開拔等費、不要一文、殊可嘉獎、我人深望孫部早日西開、致力屯决之後、再行返察復職、中央銀行總裁孔墾工作、察省主席宋哲元氏、須待察局解决之後、再行返察復職、中央銀行總裁孔祥煕氏、日内將北上一行、孔氏此去、頗有益於察局、惟孔氏因中央造幣廠之新幣、定於七月一日發行、日來正忙於審查以致遲遲未行耳、</p>

<p>贛匪勢已崩潰國軍在追勦中</p>
<p>業已克復之匪區將力謀救濟</p>
<p>中央社云、三省勦匪總部秘書長楊永泰氏、日前由贛抵京、晋謁汪院長、報告剿匪近况、楊氏又因要公、於昨晨八時許抵滬、中央社記者、訪之於其寓所、詢及蔣委員長剿匪現狀、據談如次、</p>
<p>乘勝追剿贛省匪患、因匪衆據險頑抗、故進剿以來、迄未完全肅淸、爲害地方、至爲慘毒、自蔣委員長駐贛進剿後、即通令各軍、努力兜剿、限期肅淸、詎匪衆反將宜黄圍困、蔣委員長爲鼓勵前線將士、最近曾赴前線撫路一帶視察、故軍心大爲振奮、圍困宜黄之匪、業已崩潰、分向匪巢樂安等地四竄、圍軍業已乘勝進剿、期直搗匪巢、解决民困、</p>
<p>限期肅淸贛省赤匪、據最近調查、雖難得確數、當有七萬許槍械、剿匪國軍、約在二十萬以上、西路何鍵·南路陳濟棠·及劉鎭華·等、將約期圍剿、則三閱月内、雖不能完全肅淸贛匪、决不難滅其主力部隊、勦匪國軍、並無勦匪專權、係按照原定軍費撥發、外傳將籌發勦匪公債等說、殊非事實云、</p>
<p>勦匪困難勦匪工作、至爲困難、因匪衆中常有良善百姓、牽連在内、中央軍一面勦匪、一面須撫輯良民、此種戰爭、可以謂爲爭民之戰、必須使民衆幡然悔悟、故進勦更兼做勸諭工作、實較任何戰爭爲困難也、</p>
<p>負責救濟至於已經克復之匪區、則由中央及地方政府負責救濟、力謀農村之復興、蓋該區鄕民、歷受赤匪搶刦屠殺、非有相當之救濟、則人民决不能安居樂業、中央對於救濟克復匪區、業已擬定辦法、如建築防匪工程、以免匪衆再侵、招撫流氓土棍、藉免爲匪利用等、均已一一依照所定辦法辦理、至於共匪内部、無論男女老少、均有相當之組織、故爲害地方之烈、實非我人　　所能及也、</p>
<p>察局問題楊氏又謂蔣委員長對於察省事件、始終乘持和平　度、希望於可能範圍内、和平解决、並希望馮煥章早日難　察境、馮氏本無力量、所恃者抗日牌子耳、閣百川氏則始終以中央意旨爲意旨、絶無問題、日前中委孔祥煕氏將北上、斡旋察事、近悉或將中止北上云云、楊氏擬在滬少留數日、將入京轉據、外傳楊氏將主鄂之說、楊氏已加否認云、</p>

<h3 id="c245">右旋定風螺 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>淸富古物單中，有右旋定風殊；珠無右旋左旋的分别，大槪是右旋定風螺吧。</p>
<p>「四寸神螺小若拳，神香供奉便星船；平安如願　風去，不使鯨濤横拍天，」這是錢塘陳仲傳所著的琉球鞋跡之一；仲博在淸道光時，隨高人錢星使赴琉球册封中山王，照例舟中供奉右旋白螺，據稱可避風濤，仲博詩中自註云：「乾隆間，班禪額爾德呢進右旋白螺；形如拳，徑四寸二分，號定風螺；前大將軍福康安征　　，高宗命從大内移出，將事後，留福建督署，匣上有「護佑渡江海平安」等語。」「註一」　　後來，又從督署移出，　於藩署，這是嘉慶五年的事。其時，越文楷季鼎元充正副是使往琉球封王，舟中供奉右旋白螺，五月初七日，自閩放洋，風波不警，六日便抵琉球，　來時也是這股。嘉慶十一年二月，將軍　冲阿征海盜蔡　，嘉慶帝曾降上諭；「從前　康安平定林爽文，曾携帶大利益吉祥右旋自螺，往來渡海，風帆平　；兹分發交　冲阿祗領，敬　帶往，渡洋獲佑；事竣凱旋之日，著派大員齋送來京。」云云。十年，齊鯤費錫章充正副星使冊封琉球，舟供神螺，兩遇風暴，俱能化險爲夷。乾隆帝御製詩文集三集，有「右旋白螺贊，一自注云；「每年藏中喇嘛，於新正及萬壽節，進丹書，所陳供器，有右旋白螺，涉海者携帶於舟，則吉祥安穏，最爲重要」。「註二」</p>
<p>右旋白螺會得定風，當在是一種神話；但，在前淸乾隆嘉慶道光時代，竟把它當作奇貨可居；忽然留在外省，忽然繳人内府，民間不知，以爲定風珠。「註三」現在淸宮古物中的右旋定風珠，大槪便是西藏額爾德呢所進的大利益吉祥右旋白螺了。當時，封琉球，征臺灣定風珠出盡風頭。現在，琉球呢？没有了！臺灣呢？没有了！徒然留得這一顆世俗相傳的定風珠；不是「大利益吉祥」，竟是「大損失倒霉」了！定風珠，定風珠，有什麽效用呢？要是，眞個有定風珠，當然眞個也有避水珠了；現在長江流域「水哉」的時欺，那裏去覓一顆救命王菩　的避水珠呢？唉！</p>
<p>註一，陳仲博含暉堂詩。註二，陳　碧蘿吟館隨筆。註三，梁章鉅浪跡　談。</p>
<h3 id="c246">夏天到了 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>我們聽見布榖鳥呌「家家布榖」，知道黄梅時節到了，農人要忙着工作了。丹麥的姑娘們聽見了第一聲的杜鵑呌，知道夏天到了，一定要留心地聽，並且要求杜鵑告訴伊們，還要守過幾年，才能出嫁；所以丹麥人說，杜鵑要回答這麽許多的問題，忙得不可開交，因此連做它自已的窠也無睱及此。</p>
<p>從傳說上看來，丹麥人比英國幽默得多。因爲英國人在上半年，每逢小路小巷中充塞泥土的當兒，常說這樣的話：「等着吧，等到杜鵑把一切泥土收拾完畢再講吧。」誰也知道杜鵑不做窠的，聰明地把泥土砌窠是燕子。那麽這句話給孩子們聽見了，一定要懷疑，爲甚麽杜鵑要到處去把泥土收拾呢？假使没有丹麥人解釋在先，這個疑團，終難打破的了。</p>
<p>在蘇珊克斯，四月十四日稱爲「杜鵑日」，四月十五日稱爲「燕子日」。爲甚麽稱爲「杜鵑日」，却有一故事可講：原來有個老婦人曾經騎了掃帚柄飛到了法國，把第一隻杜鵑放在籃裏帶回來，帶到希斯斐爾特地方，把杜鵑放走，這一天是四月十四日；而且放走杜鵑的地方，也很著名，就是傑克凱特子反叛中被殺之處。「杜鵑日」的來源是如此。</p>
<p>杜鵑在外國是如此，在中國却不然，我們又稱它爲子規，或斷腸鳥，呌的聲音好像說：「不如歸去」。所以我國關於杜鵑的傳說，是消極的，頽喪的，悲哀的；祇有對於布榖鳥的傳說，却是積極的，興奮的，快樂的。現在還是捨杜鵑而取布榖鳥。</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，嘮嘮叨叨的大講洋貨，似乎是不識相。不過我們有過「中學爲體西學爲用」的主義，不妨來個布榖日」好在我國是「以農立國」，雖則「榖賤傷農」的不景氣，尙未消滅，到底不能連榖也不用布，稻也不必種啊。榖仍要布，稻　要種，那麽來一個「布榖日」，倒很相宜。在這一天，農村中應舉行儀式，講演種有關農事的淺近實用常識，使農人聽了，可去實行改良，定有莫大利益，比什麽「犧牲日」「削碼日」「忍痛日」等等推銷洋貨，自絶生路，肉麻當有趣，要高明得多咧。</p>
<h3 id="c247">避 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>莫小覷這「避」字，在人類的生活史上，倒也免不掉這一頁。</p>
<p>「避債」避難「」避罪，這是我們小百姓的家常便飯。</p>
<p>「避壽」「避客」「避暑」，那倒不是人人做得到的，前世不敲穿十七八個木魚，今世决没有這種福分。</p>
<p>人窮了必要舉債，債主的面孔是出毛的，要你還時，眞會逼得你上天無路，入地無門。借債的老祖宗，要算周赮王了，他以帝王之尊，尙且築了債台，不也和債主見面，你想債主的勢力大不大？現在的人，爲了債太多了，鴻飛冥冥，實行避債，還有欠了女人的債，常常躱在澡堂子裏去的，倒也是一個絶妙好法。</p>
<p>說到避難，倒也有好幾　。大水冲來，把你的田廬牲畜，充公　水晶宮裏去。三年不下雨，千里不毛，呌份　　土塊根的滋味。戰事起了，頭上有飛機抛下的炸彈；旁邊有大砲彈小槍彈兩點設飛來。這三般災難逢到了，伯你不向安全地帶逃避。你要是硬硬頭皮，說聲不逃，閻　老子準會收容你去。</p>
<p>小弟兄爲了爭風打架：窮朋友爲了刦物傷人，事情發作了，準要出外去避避風頭。搖筆桿的朋友，出言不愼，觸怒當道，一聽風聲不好，立刻逃遁爲妙。反對派得了勢，你要是强項不肯投降，也以三十六着，走爲上着。</p>
<p>這三種的避，是苦楚的，是不幸的，也是人們不願接受的，偏有成億成萬的人，在嘗試這種滋味。</p>
<p>「避壽」「避客」「避暑」，這三種要全避到，起碼是地方上一個大亨。逢到自已四十五十的大慶；妻子兒女的生日；父母的冥壽，自有人送壽禮，拜壽星。禮却不妨照單全收，拜倒不敢領受，在别地方避一避，以表他是謙廉君子。日常有客上門，要是比我高一些，不妨倒展相迎。倘使是窮親戚和蹩脚朋友，不妨吩咐門房擋駕，避了一避，省了多少累擾。到了炎暑大氣，任是家裏裝了冷氣管和電風扇，須要到牯　·靑島·莫干山去逛一趟，才顯出您是特殊階級的人物。</p>
<p>落伍的君子曰：貴人有三避，「避壽」「避客」「避炎暑」；窮人也有三避，「避債」「避難」「避罪刑」。貴人之避坦坦然；窮人之避常戚戚。</p>

<p>第十回　　聞語警芳心封侯願渺</p>
<p>聽歌現羨色報國身閑</p>
<p>他笑着滿臉的皺紋，用手摸了他那蒼白色的山羊鬍子，走進屋來。一進門，就向桂枝連拱兩下手，笑道：原來是楊家老姑娘，咱們住在一條街上，倒有半年没見。桂枝只得起身相迎，向他點了一個頭。他笑道：老太太好哇！你娘兒倆辛苦呵丨桂枝被這老先生幾句客氣話說着，當然不便掉轉身就走，又只得坐了下來。牛先生究竟念了幾句書，就在窗户邊的一張破椅子上坐了。臉子可正朝望着他們。手摸了鬍了兩下，然後笑道：你們爲什麽提到了當兵？劉家媽道：老姑娘搬來了一個院鄰，是個當連長的，老太爺有六十多了，我倒替人家担憂。牛先生點點頭道：您是過來人，成爲驚弓鳥了。劉家媽昻了頭微微的歎了一口氣道：别提到過去的事，提起來了，眞呌人傷心。我們小孩子爸爸，娶過我來十五年没有在一塊兒過活着三個月整的。中間有三年，他跟着軍隊走，音信不通，不是我娘家還有兩個錢，津貼我一點子，我早就餓成人乾了。他總是對我說，現時不能常在一處，那也不要緊，只要不短你的吃喝就得了。你熬着罷，熬着我當了營長就好了。我也相信他這話，看到許多人當營長，都很自由，果然比良土好得多。我也這樣想，誰敎我嫁一個軍人呢？那也就只好熬着罷。那年打南口，他已經升到連長了，眼看到營長，就只差一個臺階兒了。可是有一次讓他帶一連人去搶山口子，就只剩三個人回來。我們孩子的爸爸，就是這一天陣亡了。那個日子，我才三十八歲，老不老，少又不少，怎麽辦呢，也就只好帶了孩子熬着罷。說起話來，這事又是六七年了。（一一五）</p>

<h3 id="c249">西瓜的種種 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>西瓜是消暑的佳物，各果誧中　蒙的陳列着，不久便要充掠於市了。按四夷附錄：「五代時胡　唇此種。」那麽我們所啖的西瓜，便是回紇的風味了。</p>
<p>數年詢吳佩孚妻張夫人，運大批西瓜，采用古時瓜戰之典；犒當戰士，心漢閣主有瓜戰詩一絶：「激動三軍奮鬥時，特標瓜戰好名詞，將軍需搖夫人妙；雙　聨吟瓜戰詩」。</p>
<p>我　黄　，瓜之産額很多，所以黄埭瓜子，馳名南北。又西跨塘的　福山，産瓜鬆甘氣比，也屬　品。</p>
<p>維陽人有一種小工藝，善於　瓜爲燈，人物山水，花草禽魚，樣樣精緻，寗　燃燭其中，綠沉沉地很够味。可惜這種證時間性太短，容易腐爛。</p>
<p>西瓜和糖而啖，這是很　常的事，聽說美利堅人却喜歡西瓜中　以食鹽，視爲佳味，這眞嗜虶懸殊了。</p>
<p>西瓜去，置鴨其中而蒸之，淸鮮可口，名爲西瓜鴨，我們的蘇菜館中，夏日往往有這一色的餚饌。</p>
<p>汴地西瓜是很大的，差不多每擔祇一二枚，每枚重可五六十斤，不足爲奇。所以有幾家合買一枚的，否則人少恐怕吃不完呢。</p>

<h3 id="c271">說模仿 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>据希臘亞利士多德說來，藝術的起源，是在模仿。若推理的倒測，是眞的話，那中華民族，倒是一個最藝術的民族，何以呢？因爲中國人是最富於模仿性的。雖然是好的意義的模仿呢，還是壞的意義的模仿，我們却也不敢斷言。　　中國人的善於模仿的秘訣，第一，是在模仿表面，而不講實際；譬如，大家都知道了西洋文化的好處，中國人也非學他們不可了，於是乎阿貓阿狗，就都着起了西裝，穿上了皮靴，揑起了手杖，以爲這就是西洋文化的一切。雖然還有一種例外的吃大菜，倒是比較得實際一點。更如一說到了科學的可珍·全國上下也就會有一批歌功頌德的放屁虫出來，空空然的大喊大呌着「科學科，科學科學」，而實際上什麽是科學，怎麽的提倡科學，如何的應用科學，却一槪可以置之不論。雖然在政治上應用了　横反覆之術，來爭取一點地位，和收取幾十萬節敬炭敬之類，倒是比較得實際的唯物史觀與科學方法。</p>
<p>模仿最易成功的第二箇秘訣，是在模仿人家的壞處，頂明顯的好你，只須聽一聽受着西洋人的敎育的許多中國子弟之吃敎者和吃洋行稅開飯者的中國話，就馬上可以看出來。他們别的事情，倒會置之不學，而獨有那一口奇怪的外國人說的中國話，却箇箇都能夠說得同外國人一樣。名詞動詞的頻倒，抑揚頓挫的特異，你若閉上了眼睛，不看見在你面前說話的那一張黄色，斜眼，獅鼻的臉，那你會相信，是一位外國人在向你說敎：「耶穌頂頂好的人！」箇人旣是如此，同樣地，國家也是一樣。從前嚮往着嚴寒的北國，現在却又有一部分人醉心於炎熱的南歐的某一小邦了。</p>
<h3 id="c272">靑年的心 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>大詩人Ｂａｕｄｅｌａｉｒｏ的詩集「惡之華」（Ｌｅｓ　ｆｌｅｕｒｓ　ｄｕ　ｍａｌ）中有一首「秋之歌」）Ｌｅ　　ｃｈａｎｔ　ｄ、ａｕｔｏｍｎｅ），「秋之歌」中有這樣的兩行：</p>
<p>「恰如北極的地獄中的太陽一般，我的心只是冰凍而通紅的一團。」　　波特菜爾爲什麽有這樣的心情，我不得而知。我只驚異這兩行詩句，倘用以形容現代中國的靑年，何其怡當！</p>
<p>常有人，把旭日比喻童年和少年，則靑年當是正午的太陽，靑年的心，該有萬丈光㷔，無量熱力。有這樣的心的靑年，該是活躍，興奮，敢說，敢笑，敢於正視，敢於邁進。</p>
<p>然而，在中國，看不到這樣的靑年者，蓋已若干年。中國的靑年們的心，久已失了光，失了熱，變成冰凍而通紅的一團了。</p>
<p>責備靑年們的消沈隠匿者，不乏其人，但他們不看一看靑年們周圍的北極的地獄。冰山，東面是雪白的可怖的冰山，南面是雪白的可怖的冰山，西面是雪白的可怖的冰山，北面也是雪白的可怖的冰山，四面團團地圍住，没有出路。縱有號召同志開闢生路的勇士，但一開口，即爲朔風所窒息，一舉步，即爲雪窖所吞嗤，而陸續地毁滅，</p>
<p>於是，靑年們開不得口，動不得脚了，</p>
<p>於是，靑年們的心變成冰凍而通通一團。</p>
<p>然而，畢竟是靑年的心。故尙能通紅。</p>
<h3 id="c273">讀「母親」 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 犬馬</p>
<p>丁玲失蹤了，但她的「母親」却出版了。每一個讀者閱讀這本「遺著」（？）的時候，我想，總會感到無名的悽惶，同時總得誠懇地禱祝這位女作家，有一天終得無恙地歸來。</p>
<p>「母親」，據說是一個狠偉大的創作計劃中的一部分，原計劃是打算從她母親的時代寫到她自已的時代，母親便是寫的她母親的時代，丨丨辛亥革命時代。</p>
<p>然而我以爲「母親」的時代描寫是不大顯明的，這就是說，著者對於辛亥革命那一時代的描寫太模糊了，太不親切了。這或者是由於（一）著者本來不是辛亥革命時代的人，她並没有豐富的那一時代的實際生活經騐；（二）著者的家庭本來是一個「大户」，這「大户」是日益破落了，或者關於這大户破落的情狀，著者從她親母的口裏聽得太多，所以在下筆的時候，不自覺的會懷着感傷的情調，多作「開元盛事」的追憶，以及關於這破落大户的情况的叙述，而不能實際把握住那一時代，爲那一時代的運動與縳變劃出一個明顯的輪廓。</p>
<p>你看，在全書二八九頁的篇幅裏，她差不多花了二分之一的篇幅去描寫這一「大户」（江家）破落的情狀，而在另一個二分之一的篇幅裏，也不時追述另一「大户」（于家）往日的盛事。她描寫江家破落的情狀及那孤兒寡母的凄凉景况狠詳細，她描寫那誠篤而忠實的老家人（么媽）也很詳細，她描寫丁家的景况以至丁家的大姑奶奶，二姑奶奶，三姑奶奶，：：：等的景况無不詳細，就是在這整個故事中不佔重要地位的杜淑貞，也描寫得很詳細，關於這些差不多全是用着紅樓夢的描寫手腕加以仔細的刻劃，或者可以說是刻意模仿着紅樓夢，尤其是其中關於于三少奶奶的描寫，顯然就是王煕鳳的複影，而那大姪少奶奶也顯然就是劉姥姥的替身，總之，關於這些她都是用的「細寫」，然而關於那一時代的動盪與轉變，她却用的是「大寫」了，那只是粗粗的幾筆，那只是一條若有若無的淡影。</p>
<p>「世界眞是不同了，雲卿也不同了，：：：但是他敎書就同當日父親的敎書不同。他並不敎人做文章，只敎學生們怎樣把國家弄好，說什麽民權，什麽共和，全是些新奇的東西。」</p>
<p>「你那裏懂得？現在又另是一個派兒，文章都變了樣子。」</p>
<p>這便是著者對於這一動盪時代的描寫，這描寫是何等的糢糊呵！還有，那便是女人（像金先生之流）放脚男人（像雲卿之流）剪去長拖着的豚尾，那便是少奶奶小姐們坐着轎子帶着老媽子丫頭們去上新開辦的女學堂，雖說也曾提到鴉片戰爭，提到八國聨軍之役，提到驅逐滿淸，然而那只是僅僅地「提到」，而並没有寫出帝國主義者在敲破了中國的門户以後那强烈的政治的經濟的侵略所給予中國這一農業國家的影響，也没有寫出滿洲政府的昏庸與虐政所給予中國大衆的影響，爲什麽要騙逐滿淸？爲什麽要維新？爲什麽要革命？這些都没有交代，所以著者關於辛亥革命前的動盪時代的描寫，顯然是「不夠」。</p>
<p>尤其是關於辛亥革命這一偉大運動的描寫，更是「不够」，更是簡單，關於辛亥革命運動的交代，只是女學堂的見神見鬼似的驚惶，只是「怕革命黨要起事了，有的說在南京，有的說在廣東，有的說在漢口：：：」只是那天的夜晚果眞起了事，就在考棚那邊，大約是那裏傳來一陣零落的洋槍聲：：：第二天，街上悄悄的也没有人敢於開門，知縣官已經在昨夜逃走了，兵死了幾個，跑了一些，其餘的都投降了，也死了一些流氓，幾個没有下鄒的老紳士，維持了這城裏的秩序，裏面夾了幾個剪髮的年營紳士，大約就是革命黨罷「。關於辛亥革命，著者便是這樣轉易地交代了，似乎這只是一個偶然的風波，而不是一個　釀成熟的突變，似乎這一「風波」只是武陵一處所獨有，而不是一個廣泛的普遍的運動，這樣的「大寫」，是不是能給予議者以那一時代一個明晰的輪廓呢？當然，這一企圖是完全失敗了？</p>
<p>這只是一個梗槪的批評，丨丨不，一點讀後的感想，其他還有許多地方似乎都有商榷的餘地，然而限於　幅，只好留到以後再說。</p>
<h3 id="c274">短視非病說 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>

<p>予想短視，近益加劇，頗以無力得致滿剌加國靉霴爲慽。室人笑曰：「如此世界，近視亦佳，眼光遠大，轉爲不妙也。」戲言而頗有思理。後漢書獨行傳，載健爲任永，與梓潼馮信，皆託靑肓以避世難。永妻淫於前，匿情無言。見予入井，忍而不救。信侍婢亦對信姦通。及蜀亂粗平，皆盥洗更視，曰，「世適平，目即淸。」又晉書阮籍傳，言籍能爲靑白眼，見禮俗之士，以白眼對之。古人或以靑肓自汚，或以白眼自　，吾何慊於短視乎？金瓶梅第一回，記西門慶白賣光常峙節應伯爵等十人，國赴玉皇廟結拜兄北。四顧廟堂，瞥見馬趙溫黄四大元帥。白賚光論馬元帥之三隻眼，亦殊不理致。</p>
<p>白賚光携着常峙節的手兒，從左邊看將過來，一到馬元師面前，見這馬元帥威風凜凜，相貌堂堂，上面畫著三隻眼睛。便呌常峙節道，「哥，這却怎的說？如今世界，開隻眼兒閉隻眼兒便好，還經得多出隻眼睛看人破綻哩！」應伯爵聽見的走過來道：「獃兄弟，他多隻眼兒看你，倒不好麽？」衆人笑了。</p>
<p>古人有言，察見淵魚者不祥，何况看人破綻！「如今世界，開隻眼兒閉隻眼兒便好。」、此金瓶梅之著者開宗明義之微意也。予雖短視，猶愈於開隻眼兒閉隻眼兒　之眇者，短視短視，何足病哉？</p>

<h3 id="c276">談排泄 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>吃大菜，吃大餅，喝參湯，喝自來水，無論怎麽吃，無論怎麽喝，總得要排泄，這大槪是完全不成問題的吧。然而同樣的排泄，却有不同樣的排泄方式。關於這一點，我可以舉出許多明顯的例證。</p>
<p>說：有一次我在個小縣裏的牧師的家裏，　現洋大人拉屎，是要用一節長的洋鉛皮管子從二層模上的馬桶底直接樓下。當然是好處很多，第一是拉屎的不會嗅着自已屎臭，第二可以省得下樓。當時我想外國人到底來得聰明，想得出這等巧妙方法。到後來我才明白過來，原來大都裏的抽水馬桶就和那個一般無二。不過那小縣可惜還没有自來水的大建設，只好由中國僕人提着一桶泉水在厠所門前等着，洋大人大泄一通之後，然後傾盆瀉下，乾乾淨，完全如意。</p>
<p>又有一次，聽說有少年財東汪姓者，平生對於起居，極爲講究。拉屎時必須在地板上舗下一疊玉版宣紙，由其女僕，在旁侍候，凡撤下一斷，立刻爲之包好棄去。這種方法，當然也不在洋大人之下，聰明得很。雖然拉屎者固然是人，而包屎者也列於人類之中，可是人道主義却不像從前那般賣得起價錢了。　　以上二則，都不過是小縣裏的新謁，算不了什麽。可是一到了上海，却是大不相同了。抽水馬桶可以說很是普遍，凡出得出五十元房金的，差不多都有如此福分。至於大旅館，大戲院等公共塲所，對於排泄設備，更是富麗堂皇。走進厠所，立刻有人上前侍候。用香皂浣手之後，再對着鏡子整理一下領結，梳一梳頭髮。</p>
<p>然而這也祇限於上層社會的特殊情形，而下層的罪孽深重的衆生，却常爲着排瀉而吃盡苦頭。有許多勞苦的男人，爲了省下每月二毛的倒馬桶錢，而且買一隻馬桶也得一塊多，於是只好趁着無人看見的時候，藏在空地裏的廣告牌後面方便一次。可是不幸却碰着了三道頭，假如又來不及捲褲潛逃，一陣木棒之後捉將行裏去。多則大洋五元，少則拘禁三天。不律森嚴，决不姑貸。還有平常以爲禁止小便盡了烏龜的地方便是小便之處，很大胆的一瀉千里，可是有時命運不濟，也會遇着板着面孔的房主人，當然臭駡一頓，還要眞的「送捕究辦不貸」·。還有許多手提着龍地李或雞鴨蛋的鄕下女人，在没有辦法的時候，也得不守婦道的學着男人方便幾次。至於工廠裏的女工，却有些不大同樣，她們很想瞞着拿摩溫到馬桶間去打瞌盹，雖然那裏有小姐們想不到的臭氣薰天，可是爲了休息，却也不必帶着香水在身了。</p>
<p>因爲大小便確有如此不便，所以排泄一事，也就成爲國富財源之一種了。據說漢口便有過粪尿局長之官，用投標方法公平委任，得此缺者其收入不在禁烟局長之下。然而這是從前的事，革命之後·一切都跟着革新。現在是淸平盛世，當然不會有如此臭事。然而政府收入，不是大爲減少嗎？這可要貝一份政府公報了。</p>
<h3 id="c277">上海居民區域的烏瞰 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 匡</p>
<p>隔昨有筆名吾先生者，在本刊發表過一篇談住居的大文，頗饒風趣、而又　義深長，引帶動了我來寫這篇東西；但並非貿望附驥，更無媲美妄想。</p>
<p>次則因爲翻徧厚厚的一本上海指南，獨於居民區域的分析一層，缺而未詳，誠屬遺珠，這倒使我頗有「以此奉補」的心思，至少希望「家有上海指南者」垂采爲考。</p>
<p>上海的居民分佈，據我的觀察與研究所得，太致可分下列各區：</p>
<p>資本家區此區地域爲英租界，自黄灘迤西，至壁利南路兆豐公園止。以西藏路爲界，向東可說是資本家的行都，也是生財的地帶，大銀行，大公司，大旅社，全都集中在這區域内。馬路上的第一號佈景是蚱蜢似的汽車和螞蟻似的西裝客。自西藏路以西如靜安寺路西摩路愚園路等，便是資本家的首都，也就是他們窩心亨樂的地帶，洋房，别墅，花園，電影院，跳舞塲，最爲傑出</p>
<p>貧民區可分下列二小區：</p>
<p>紗廠工人區以楊樹浦小沙渡兩處爲大本營，上海所有的紗廠，幾乎全數集中在這兩處，曲駝背，半摩登的姑娘，榨得乾　的未成年的女小孩，在大淸早或傍晚，潮一般地湧，是馬路上的唯一點綴品。</p>
<p>人力車夫區如黄包車夫，獨輪車夫，板車夫，拖車夫，大槪都　居於閘北，他們整日流着血汗，却又無時不鬧着飢餓，直接的間接的被資本家榨壓，骨和血營成了資本家區的繁榮。</p>
<p>（三）中産者區據我的觀察，中産者在上海是没有一定的區域的，許是上海已極度的資本主義化了的原故吧。他們大槪都　居於上述二區之中，而以雜　於貧民　者　　　　　　　　　　　　　此外還有若干</p>
<p>（一）政客區是在法租界，什麽院長的住宅，部長的公館，全都在這裏，四五等的小政客，也都在此賃居。如果政治一起變化，我們便可在法租界的一些馬路上看到忙得不亦樂乎的跑街似的人物。他們發也的政論，全都是爲國爲民，自已倒情願入火坑的。</p>
<p>（二）遺老區辮子還捨不得剪掉，拖在肩後，或盤在頭頂上，如舉人秀才之流，大都集聚於「頗有古風」的南市，他們雖不慣坐洋汽車，但半洋的包車却每個都有一部。偶爾漫步到繁華地帶，如南京路等處，只見他們搖頭。</p>
<p>（三）學生區這也可說是上海的邊沿區，由徐家匯，而梵王渡，而江灣，而楊樹浦底，上海的幾所著名大學，都在這些地方，洋裝學生往來於中心市區者，有如過江之鯽，又活似織布之梭，車子生意很好。</p>
<p>野鷄區這又要說到法租界，如東新橋，西新橋，大世界後之菜市街，都是她們的活動區。臨晚，傻點的人，路過其境，即可倖免於拉槓進去，也要嚇得你毛骨悚然，無所措手足。</p>
<p>（五）烟賭及白相朋友區也是在法租界，到馬路口去走，隨時可以看到白相朋友扭做一團；一些小旅館，可說全是變相的烟館：賭窟也隨處皆是，賭客自然都集在這區内。</p>
<p>煞尾一句：上海是中國文化經濟的總區，也是罪惡禍患的總區。</p>
<h3 id="c278">寄給閡隔了的松 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 靨</p>
<p>松，</p>
<p>這封是第七次結你的通訊了。你的妹自從你走了後，兩天中祇有吃了半口白飯，她整天的哭喪着臉向着我；要我把你抓回來。因爲你的妹子没有你在是不行的，她祇靠你的一切而活着。今天是你走後的第三天了，她仍是寢食全　，商　　　　　少而枯黄　　　　她也白天伏在　　　　　　　　　　　　　　人不能成寐；倘使再是這樣，樓下二房東是極易下逐客令的。</p>
<p>你爲了葉女士的原故，毅然不辭而别地離開了你的親愛的妹：和最忠實於你的我。以前我和你是親熱，深交，一旦反了目，便變了冷淡，仇敵。幾天間給你六封函，你也不回復我；然而我雖是托人交給你，難道你以爲這是不値得爲的嗎？從前你從學校裏回來，常常封我說這一類的話；某女士怎樣的摩登，怎樣的漂亮，某女士男朋友多，某女士最喜觀看電影和吃東西：：：。當時我屢屢狠牽强地點了幾點頭。過後我才慢慢地勸導你，指示你千萬不要祇知醉心於求愛，因而誤入歧途。你便付之一笑，以爲我是在禱告的一樣不能入你的耳朶裏。然而我雖則不能强迫你聽從我，但我狠老實地像敎訓你的一般。當時我知你是狠恨我的了，可是我不因你恨我的原故而三緘其口。因此，我甘心受你的恨，希望你能悔悟，改過，但是事實的演出是和我的希望相反着。</p>
<p>你現在還不過是十七歲的年齡，倘使事情做糟了還熥原諒。你不應突然就離開了那年糼的妹，因爲她還不能自立的原故。</p>
<p>而且自從你認識了葉女士之後，你的同學狠多對你非議着。但除却那兩位終日和你交游的，甚至可以稱爲狎友外；我是極力和你辯護，伸駁，作闢謠的宣傳着。我信任你的知識和見解是豐富的，而不致於越出範圍外的行動；所以我殊不計及多費唇舌，做你的最忠實的辯護士。但你在這個過去的星期日從校裏回來時，你的態度突變了，無端由底責罰你親愛的妹。和我說話時稍爲有了點抵觸，便是破口謾駡。我眞不明白你這樣幹是甚麽意思；或者你故意對我是實行報復。然而我的心到底不是木石，那時候祇有狂跳一陣。</p>
<p>過後，你對我便實行緘默主義。無論</p>
<p>我是如何向你勸導，賠罪，你總是置之不睬。於是我在你底同學面前失了信任；因爲你的行動不幸給他們而言中。唉！</p>
<p>末後，我察覺你得了葉女士的歡心，便因而嬌矜起來。兼且你和那兩位摯友愈形親密，好像是得了護身符一樣；因爲他們兩位都是急於追逐女性的啊！</p>
<p>以前，你也曾說我是妬忌，阻止你的自由。其實，這不過是給女性朿縛你；她能驅駛你有爲的心，向着堕落方面去，還有什麽値得妬忌的價値？在你因爲我是在從中阻梗，便數天中都不曾歸來一次；你忍心不顧全你的妹，使她終日如有所失地悲泣着。啊！你也太忍心了。</p>
<p>松！你要知道我這並非和普通的囂駡，也不是　意侮唇你。希望你恕過我，　　我的說話是對的。　去了你一切的誘感，馬上就回來看你的親愛而年糼的妹罷！　六月二十七</p>

<p>— 夏嵤</p>
<p>「就這一天吧！」父親把萬年歷上有密密的小字的一行指給我看。這是父親坐一夜一天的火車，從家裏帶來的一册國歷廢歷判照的標準歷書，這是我們政府决定改用國歷之後，所絶對要查禁的。可是，在帝國主義統治下的上海租界裏，在每年的十一月就開始在馬路上高聲呌賣「陰陽歷對照，别處買不到！」父親手裏就是這樣的歷書</p>
<p>「隨便：：：」我不能參加别的意見。我讀過十五年書，也曾東西南北過了三年流浪生活，講起年紀也不算靑啦。可是現在每年還要向父親討七八百塊錢化在上海做讀書哥兒的我，自已是不好意思提議什麽意見的。若要體面，把自已當做一個有爲的前進的革命的現代靑年，「過幾年再說，現在還談不到。」意思是過幾年經濟獨立之後。那可糟啦！幾年幾十年纔能經濟獨立，夠得建設一個現代小家庭呢？我眞不敢去想那些！</p>
<p>我底一位哥哥，大學畢業之後，在上海已做三年電機工程師，每年也有千把塊錢收入。但每月把房租伙食衣着應酬等開消之後。他底銀行存欵摺上，永遠祇有五塊零幾角錢利息、從不見他再存上一塊錢的。他說的，「要結婚，除非大香檳得頭奬：女人家的一雙絲襪也得化上二十五塊錢。」自然，女人家是不大好應付的，巴黎香水，高跟皮鞋，長旗袍。可是我們中國化二十五塊錢買一雙絲襪的女人有幾個？那二十塊錢一月的寫字間職員也能養活一家子，是怎麽過去的呢？要怪，就祇能怪高等敎育害了人！</p>
<p>我嗎，總算是驕子，這是多心不了許多的。旣然是父親的意思，就好像打了上課鐘，祇好腋下夾着書，闌珊地進敎室。讀書哥兒的光陰是容易消磨的，到底腋下夾的什麽書，進敎裏去做的什麽事，讓我慢慢地告訴吧！</p>

<p>— 悟非</p>
<p>本屆上海市畢業會考，自洩漏試題，發生不幸後，各方輿論，頗多賣難，有謂不必續行考試者，有謂索性全部無效者·余意舞弊是一事，續考又是一事確有嫌疑之局員，移送法院偵查，則此事眞相，不　水落石出，至續考問題，亦於二十四日舉行，雖尙有若干學生反對參加，大致可告一段落，爰將續考所聞，縷述如次。</p>
<p>親自命題</p>
<p>會考時各科試題，由考委會聘請局外人員，先爲每科二人以上之命題，次由委員長集合選定，再交京市某印刷所校印，於考前一日，送至上海，以免意外，其辦理不可謂不愼，迺因不知自愛之局員所舞弊，致無良好結果，故於續考試題，委員長親自擬定，命員工緒印，扃閉一室，翌晨啓鑰，然後分致各主試員，遄赴各　，眞小心之</p>
<p>毅力堅持</p>
<p>又聞續考日，監試南洋高商者爲張元春君，張君准時蒞校，初無一生，迺詢校長以學籍簿，調查住址後，命校役駕自由軍飛馳，個别知照，直至下午五時始有初中部五生來校，遂開始考試，其毅力堅持，必達續考目的之精神可謂不易，此五生中有一生言已謀有一席，惟前途資格，至少須初中，亟盼續考以博一紙畢業證書，果爾則辦事能力，雖以才識之若何爲斷，而資格問題，實不無相當之關係也。</p>
<p>比例加分</p>
<p>詢之有關係人，謂各利試卷　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，對於標準，懸殊過甚，不得已逎用比例加分法，如在三十分以上，再加二十五分，五十分以上再加十分，如此則皆可派司，即已及格者，亦酌加若干分，實愛莫能助，徒呼負負而已。</p>
<p>最後機會</p>
<p>續考之後，及格名册，最近期間，當可發表，惟因病而未參加者，原定補考之例，聞未參加續考之學生，仍得參與補考，如此則尙有最後之機會，尙依然堅執，不肯參加，僅因一二科未考　　　升學發注問題，殊不　得也。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個想要做店員而没有做着的初中畢業生。我們兄弟兩人，大哥在他十四歲的那年，由父親托人薦到本埠某豆麥行爲學徒，其時他剛從高小裏畢業呢。經過三年的訓練，居然寫也來，算也來；現在每月的收入，約有百二三十元之數，很足以應付他小家庭的用度。我呢！在小學裏畢業的那年，父親恰好收入略豐，更兼哥哥已經自立，所以决定送到初中裏去繼續求學。光陰如箭，轉瞬三年畢業了。想再升學罷，究屬家嚴並無多金，所以不得不托人謀事；我心裏總以爲多讀了三年書，找事情，當然比較容易了。豈知事實上竟適得其反。許多父執，竟不約而同的搖頭縐眉：說初中畢業生，出路最難。舊商店中去做學徒罷，什九會吃不慣苦而半途中輟；大機關裏去當小職員罷，學識經騐，都不夠應付。所以直到至今，已經二年十個月了，還是不得其門而入。唉，吃得慣苦與吃不慣苦，是各個人不同的，我相信我自已，苦是能吃的。至於學識經騐，當然是淺薄的，但是說多讀了三年的初中畢業生，反不若小學校的畢業生，這話又那裏說起呢！所以我每聽到父親唉聲嘆氣地說「悔不該給他多讀了三年書」的時候，心裏不期然而然的湧起一種異樣的情緒：這話究竟對嗎？先生，請你細細地指敎！此請</p>
<p>撰安沈甘棠謹上</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>後：這件事，看來很不合還緝，　　過實地調查的結果，却是一件很普偏的矛盾。沈君現在找事情，不能像你哥哥那樣的便　，大一半因爲社會的經濟狀况，今非昔比的緣故。但是初中畢業生之不爲社會所歡迎，也是事實。社會人士，對於初中畢業生的態度，其差誤之處，沈君的來信，說得已經很透澈。不過三年初中敎育，所給予學生們的學　，大半抵不過這三年中所得的傲性，　不能說不無例外，伹大槪也不能否認。所以這種矛盾的剷除，要從三方面共用努力。（一）主持初中敎育的人，應當注意到這一點，俾學生畢業後，可以適應環境。（二）在初中學生方面，也應當將傲氣戒絶，要知道初中畢業生，値不得什麽，虚　若谷地去做事，能吃苦，肯領敎。（三）社會人士，也應當知道靑年是國家元氣，斷不能以以前遇到幾個不爭氣的初中畢業生而槪其餘。要知道人的品格，是各個不同的，不妨給他們一個試騐的機會。提挈後進，這賣任是不能推卸的。</p>

<p>「陳委員出去了。」當差將一句輕蔑的話擲書來，便把門關上了。他的心雖如釋重担地放了下來，臉孔却獨自紅了，遲疑了一會，才垂頭喪氣往回路走，他失業的兩年中，吃閉門羹本是常事，可是現在的情形應該特殊些：在和日本打仗的時候，自已的國内同胞總該較平日親愛些罷，還攏什麽要人架了，而且，而且他重新感覺肚皮餓，重新模摸袋裏僅有三張飯票子，只有陳天任答認他辦一個雜誌，才向他拿得錢到：：：愛國的觀開始和他的肚皮衝突起來：：但是無論如何總得忍耐下去，許多的要人起初在没有得人賞議的時代，誰不是要經過這一度痛苦的階段。他自慰自解地想一番之後，準備今下午再來試試看。</p>

<p>「還不是一樣！」靑年們誰都會這樣回答。儘管他們在同學時曾經鬧過義氣，也許有過派别之事。這時候便不免引起一種骨肉流離的感情，他們便不禁黯然神傷了。</p>

<p>石喬對於王化的話並不完全贊成，他以爲辦雜誌並不那般無意義，好好的辦起來，公正地說些話，未當無補於國家社會。但誰都曉得王化確是一個幹才，也未便全蔑視他的話。不由的約了王化晚間到自已家裏去詳談，他便向大家舉了舉后，重新鼓起勇氣，向陳天任公館裏走了去。</p>

<p>And Established Committees to Handle Acceptance and Handover Procedures</p>
<p>The Li Ji Chun Faction is Resolved to be Incorporated</p>
<p>Location of Stationing Heard to Have Been Agreed Upon</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the disposition of the Luan Dong pseudo-army, our side has designated Qian Zongze, Tao Shangming, Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, Lei Shourong, Xue Zhiheng, Wei Jian, Liu Shisun and other nine persons as representatives responsible for all contacts, forming a war zone reception committee, the members of which will be the above nine persons, with Yu Xuezhong as the chairman. This is jointly organized by the Military Affairs Commission, the Political Affairs Commission, and the Hebei Provincial Government, with the Hebei Provincial Government as the main body. All organizational outlines have been approved by the Military and Political Affairs Committee. Funding has been ordered to be raised by the Provincial Government. The committee headquarters will be located in Tianjin and will be officially established on the first of next month. The Japanese side will be responsible for contacting through Nakamura, the commander of the Tianjin North China Garrison Army, and a committee will be organized to handle the handover procedures. Committee members will be dispatched by the Kwantung Army Department, the Japanese Embassy, and the North China Garrison Army Headquarters. The selection of personnel has not yet been determined. Regarding the Li Ji Chun faction, it has been decided to proceed with incorporation, but the number of people still needs to be discussed. Our side advocates for 3,000 people, and Xue Zhiheng is currently negotiating with Li. Xue and Li have a deep personal relationship. Xue has worked hard for the incorporation of the Li faction. However, the location of the Li faction's stationing has already been agreed upon, roughly in the Baodi and Jixian area. In the future, they will be transferred to that area for reorganization and training. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Earlier, our side in Beiping, due to Nagatsu's trip to Changchun, had not received any telegrams. In order to seek a quick solution, it was decided to establish a war zone reception committee in Tianjin. After its establishment, some members of the committee, such as Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, and Xue Zhiheng, will be sent as representatives to Dalian to discuss with representatives of the Kwantung Army Headquarters on the method of receiving the war zone. It was also decided to invite Li Ji Chun to Dalian to participate in the meeting at that time. This afternoon, Nagatsu returned to Ping from Changchun and met with our reception committee member Li Zeyi. As a result of his meeting with Muto in Changchun to seek instructions, he will visit our authorities tomorrow to convey them. Our reception committee members in Ping are scheduled to go to Tianjin tonight. Whether there will be any changes to the proposed meeting in Dalian will be determined in one or two days.

<p>Xue Zhiheng had previously sent a letter to Li Ji Chun, advising him to return to the fold. Li replied, saying that his previous actions were directed against a certain person, but now that the target is gone, he is willing to make a confession and his attitude is sincere.

<p>When the 6 pm train to Ping left Beiping on the 29th, Qian Zongze saw a Japanese person off to Ping at the East Station, and there were four Chinese and Japanese military police officers accompanying the train for protection. It is said that they are representatives for negotiating the reorganization of the pseudo-army. Qian got off the train at the New Station. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>A military officer in Beiping said that after a month of effort since the signing of the armistice agreement at the Tanggu Conference, the pseudo-army issue can be largely resolved. The two sides are currently in discussion. Several points cannot be ignored when discussing with the Japanese side. 1. The location and number of pseudo-army reorganizations should be restricted. After reorganization, the command and deployment should absolutely comply with the orders of the Provincial Government. 2. The reorganization of the pseudo-army and the reception of the war zone must have definite steps and deadlines. 3. The other party's so-called Great Wall line should be limited. The Great Wall cannot be recognized as the border line of Manchuria. At a minimum, neither side should station troops within a certain number of miles north and south of the Great Wall. (Special dispatch on the 29th) In Tianjin, regarding the disposition of the pseudo-army and the reception of the Luan Dong area, our side has sent Qian Zongze, Tao Shangming, Yin Rugeng, Li Zeyi, and Lei Shourong as representatives to negotiate with Japan. Japan has sent Shibayama to Ping for negotiations. Before Shibayama's arrival, Nakayama will act as a representative responsible for contacting, seeking a thorough solution to the disposal of the pseudo-army, reception, and the opening of the Beining Railway. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Incident of the Opening of the Beining Railway <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Beining Railway Bureau in Tianjin, after the pseudo-army occupied the Lutai to Yuguan route, the route signs and flags were destroyed. It is rumored that international trains will run under the protection of soldiers from various countries, but the actual situation is not so simple. According to the Boxer Protocol, if traffic is interrupted along the railway due to an accident, it should not exceed fourteen hours. Now that the train has been stopped for a long time, various countries have complained. Therefore, the Japanese side also hopes to resume traffic as soon as possible. Although the railway has contacted the Japanese side several times, it will only be realized after the pseudo-army issue is resolved. Because the railway bureau is fully responsible for passenger and freight transportation upon selling tickets and opening traffic, it cannot open the train without a security guarantee. In the future, it is planned to first open to Tangshan, and then gradually reach Yuguan via Luanzhou and Qinhuangdao. The Japanese side has transferred South Manchurian Railway vehicles, and pseudo-Fengshan Railway staff have been selling tickets and operating trains daily from Tangshan to Yuguan since the first of this month, but this is falsely claimed to be military transportation, which is deceiving the great powers.

<h3 id="e8">Truth About the Qingdao Naval Incident <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Purely a matter of personal relationships, the claim of joining the rebels is inaccurate</p>
<p>= All circles in Qingdao decide to retain Shen after his resignation</p>
<p>Xie Gangzhe will take over as a military expert to maintain the navy</p>
<p>Shen's position as mayor may not change =</p>
<p>The Qingdao naval issue is complex. Shen Honglie is from Hubei, and most of the Qingdao navy personnel are from the Northeast. Shen's military discipline is usually very strict, and his subordinates inevitably have grievances. After Zhang Xueliang stepped down, internal brewing began. It suddenly broke out a few days ago. The assassin who attempted to assassinate Shen, Ping Zhizhong, was bought out by those who opposed Shen. After the assassination failed and he was arrested and executed, a letter addressed to Shen's Chief of Staff Xie Gangzhi was found on his body, which roughly stated that if the matter was successful, there would be no problem, but in case of failure, he hoped to preserve Ping's life. This is not without a clue to be found. After Shen was assassinated, there was no conflict, and the captains of the Haiqi and other warships issued a telegram expressing their opinions. At the same time, five warships, including Haiqi, Tongji, and Haichen, voluntarily left Qingdao and sailed to Shidao, and have since gone elsewhere. Shen was quite passive about this matter and is being mediated by Xie Gangzhi. The authorities have also sent Xu Zushan to investigate. Currently, all parties believe that since internal rifts have arisen in the Qingdao navy, it is temporarily more appropriate for Xie Gangzhi to take over to maintain the situation. Shen's position as mayor of Qingdao may not change. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Shen Honglie sent Bao Yimin to Jinan to go to Pingjin to report the truth of the incident to all parties. The Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe are now requesting Shen's resignation in a telegram from Shidao. Shen's current telegram states that even if he dies, he is willing as long as they do not surrender to the puppet regime. It has now been proven that this matter has no background and is purely a personal feud. The three ships only have enough coal and water to last for another two or three days. Shen telegraphed the Executive Yuan to resign, but there has been no reply. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Due to the danger Shen Honglie faced a few days ago, he suddenly became passive and sent telegrams to both Beijing and Ping to resign. Representatives from all circles in the city held an emergency meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce on the 29th. All the representatives unanimously decided to retain Shen after his resignation and resolved four measures: 1. All representatives will meet Shen to offer their condolences and comfort. 2. Telegraph the Executive Yuan in Beijing and the Ping Political Affairs Committee to strongly retain him. 3. Five representatives will be pre-selected to go to Beijing and Ping to petition for retention if it is necessary to set off after receiving a reply. 4. Other retention methods will be carried out as appropriate. The telegram is as follows (titles omitted): "Since Mayor Shen took office, he has been diligent in government and loved the people, and is admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Upon hearing of his intention to retire, we are shocked. Qingdao is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and is known as difficult to govern. Only a diligent and upright mayor like Shen can govern it well. We believe that the Council will understand the people's feelings and, upon receipt of Mayor Shen's resignation telegram, will please respect the people's will and immediately retain him." (Omissions follow). Han Fuqu also sent Zhang Yue, a provincial commissioner, from Jinan to Qingdao on the morning of the 29th to console Mr. Shen. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>The authorities here in Beiping have ordered Xie Gangzhi to maintain the navy, and Shen will continue to maintain law and order in Qingdao. There is a rumor that Xie will succeed as the commander of the navy. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, of the Central News Agency, interviewed Chen Shaokuan in Nanjing on the 29th to inquire about the truth regarding the assassination attempt on Shen Honglie, commander of the Northeast Navy, in Qingdao, and the recent reports that the Haiqi, Zhaohe, and Haichen had left en masse, and that some had even joined the rebels. According to him, it is unfortunate that an assassination attempt on Commander Shen recently occurred in the Qingdao Navy. After this incident occurred, I offered the government my opinions on how to properly handle the aftermath. We should wait for the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission to handle the matter. It is true that the Haiqi, Zhaohe, and Haichen left Qingdao on the 26th. According to reports, the issue is related to personal relationships, and joining the rebels is not true. In addition, since the incident in the Qinghai Navy, the capital has repeatedly received reports from all sides. This matter is purely a matter of personal relationships. As for the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe, which left Qingdao yesterday, they are currently arriving in Weihaiwei and have telegraphed to Beijing to listen to the central government's decisions. The report that the three ships have joined the rebels is absolutely not true. As for the aftermath, the central government has telegraphed the Ping Military Affairs Commission to handle it fairly (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>The issue of Shen Honglie's advance and retreat in Qingdao, and the proper handling of the escaped fleet, have been transferred to the hands of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. Huang Fu recently sent Tang Shishan, a classmate of Shen Honglie, to Qingdao last night to start handling the matter. Han Fuqu also came forward in his personal capacity to mediate, and his representative also arrived in Qingdao this morning. (Electric News dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>The authorities here in Beiping have telegraphed Xie Gangzhe to be responsible for negotiating the recall of the five rebel ships, and at the same time ordered Shen Honglie to continue to handle the duties of mayor as usual. Xu Zushan is currently in Beiping and has received orders from the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee to go to Qingdao to investigate and report the case. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

Qin Dechun and Xiong Bin reported to He, and transferred He's opinions to Deng. Later, they jointly recommended Li Xin, a representative sent by Feng before, to return to Zhang on the afternoon to report to Feng and discuss matters. The complex problems in Chahar are still numerous, and there is no major progress in a peaceful resolution. It is reported that Kong Xiangxi's visit to the north has been delayed due to certain matters. Deng Zhexi is scheduled to return to Zhang tomorrow afternoon to report back to Feng. Yan is afraid of the expansion of Chahar and has repeatedly telegraphed with Jiang and Wang to discuss solutions, and has repeatedly telegraphed Feng for advice. Feng replied to Yan by telegram, expressing that he personally will not take any actions against the government. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>The order for Sun Dianying's Qinghai Western District Reclamation Superintendent arrived in Beiping last night and was transferred by the Military Affairs Commission to Sun Dianying's defense station in Shacheng.

A rough outline has been established, but the amount of departure fees has not yet been determined. Wang will telegraph the situation to Sun.

<p>Qingdao Fleet Turmoil</p>
<p>Relief for War Zones</p>
<p>In Nanjing, President Wang of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement on the turmoil in the Qingdao fleet. It is regrettable that this unfortunate incident occurred in Qingdao at a time when the country is facing serious difficulties. Both sides have sent detailed telegrams to the Central Government and the Executive Yuan reporting the incident. In order to clarify the facts, the Central Government has telegraphed the Beiping branch of the Military Affairs Commission to investigate the facts and handle them impartially. As for the rumor of Commander Shen's resignation, the Central Government has not yet received his telegram. As for the people in the North China war zone, they have been displaced after this war, and their situation is very miserable. The government is striving to find relief methods. In addition to ordering the provinces to raise funds for relief, it is also planning to formulate methods for raising relief funds, including two items: allocating funds from the Ministry of Finance and designating a kind of income as a fund to raise public bonds. The North China War Zone Relief Committee will formulate detailed measures. The Chahar incident is still being handled by the Administrative Yuan's stationed Ping Political Reorganization Committee. The situation is gradually improving and has not become serious. The Central Government has always relied on peaceful methods to resolve the Chahar issue. The rumor that Japan intends to propose a China-Japan defense alliance meeting to us has not been heard by the Central Government and individuals, so there is no expression of opinion. Regarding the organization of the cotton and wheat loan supervision committee, it is currently being carefully discussed by the Political Conference (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>According to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Qinghai-Tibet dispute has not yet been resolved. Although both sides sent personnel to negotiate last spring and agreed on a peace treaty, there were twists and turns along the way, and no results were achieved. Later, the Central Government telegraphed the Dalai Lama and Ma Bufang of Qinghai to continue to uphold their consistent peaceful intentions and quickly seek a solution. Now Qinghai and Tibet have continued to negotiate a peace treaty in accordance with the order. According to a telegram from Ma Bufang, the Qinghai-Tibet peace treaty has been formally signed, and the Qinghai and Tibet armies will station in their original defenses and will not invade each other. The Mongolian Committee believes that since the Qinghai-Tibet dispute has subsided, it will continue to resolve the Kang-Tibet dispute in order to alleviate the Central Government's concerns about the west. (29th) Nanjing Shi Qingyang said that the Jinsha River has been designated as the boundary between Kang and Tibet, and the rumor that the dispute has re-emerged is not accurate.

<p>Wang Huaichen, the president of the Chahar High Court, left his post and went south to Beijing after Feng Yuxiang launched his uprising. According to him, since Feng Yuxiang announced the war of resistance against Japan and the suppression of the bandits, although the judiciary does not involve politics, the court is the central government's judicial organ and I was unwilling to become a dependency. I resolutely left Chahar and went south. After arriving in Beijing, I visited Minister Luo and reported the unavoidable circumstances of my departure. As for the situation in Chahar and Feng's actions, a few days before I left Chahar, Feng established the banner of resisting Japan and suppressing bandits and posted slogans everywhere to drive out the acting chairman Wu Yong and appoint Tong Linge as the acting chairman. The members of the Chahar Provincial Committee all scattered and fled elsewhere. Shi was forced to serve as Feng's teacher due to his old age. After Tong took office as acting chairman, he consulted the court on Feng's orders to release communist prisoners, but I did not grant his request because I was afraid that it would be difficult to distinguish between right and wrong in the future. Therefore, I had to secretly leave my post. Before leaving, I entrusted a certain court director to temporarily act as the court's agent. It is learned that Feng's actions were not supported by Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, Feng Zhanhai, etc., except for Zhen Wu's support. They all understood the great righteousness and expressed that the country is at this critical juncture, how can there be internal strife, so they did not agree. When I returned to Beijing, Minister Luo still ordered me to return to Chahar and informed that the Central Government had a specific and peaceful solution to the Chahar affair. Since my family is in Shanghai, I plan to go to Shanghai (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Northeast Fleet Leaves Qingdao <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast Fleet is the former Bohai Fleet. Its subordinate vessels, such as the Haiqi and Haichen, have a revolutionary history. During Wu Peifu's reign, Wen Shude led the Haiqi and other main vessels north. After Wu's defeat, they moved to the Northeast and were controlled by Zhang Zuolin. Shen Honglie then succeeded Wen as the fleet commander. When the National Revolutionary Army unified the North and South, the Northeast hung the Qing and White flags. The fleet's name was then unified under the Central Government. After Honglie's assassination this time, five vessels including the Haiqi suddenly sailed away from their defense zone. According to newspaper reports, before Shen's assassination, the captains of the vessels, dissatisfied with Shen's mistreatment of their subordinates, had contemplated some kind of alliance. After the assassination attempt on Shen failed, they issued a communiqué to Shen, demanding his immediate resignation, the replacement of the commander by the former chief of staff, the release of the suspects in Shen's assassination, and the payment of three months' back pay, among other things. Therefore, from the surface of this matter, it seems to be purely an internal affair of the fleet, arising from subordinates' dissatisfaction with their commander. However, is the reality as simple as that? Are there no other political backgrounds involved? Before the truth is revealed, we dare not make any hasty comments.</p>
<p>However, based on the facts, at this time of severe national crisis, with strong enemies lurking, all public officials, regardless of their position or the importance of their duties, should dedicate themselves to the country. In this extraordinary period, apart from uniting to resist the enemy, there should be no other personal opinions or concerns. Moreover, the army and navy, both under the leadership and command of the Central Government, are frontline soldiers defending the country. Generally speaking, their education level is relatively high, and their mission is purely national defense. They should all have some understanding of the world situation and the current situation in our country. It is an undeniable fact that our country is being watched by powerful neighbors who want to create chaos in North China to seize opportunities. That insidious puppet state will not hesitate to use any despicable means to destroy our country. Therefore, rumors of attempts to induce our navy to surrender to the puppet state have long been widespread. We dare not say that the Northeast Fleet's actions this time were instigated by any party. However, at this time of national peril, naval officers should recognize their own position and act with integrity and openness. Even if there are unavoidable grievances today and they act freely for the moment, they must have something to explain to our countrymen in the future. Only then can they dispel the suspicions of our countrymen. If, unfortunately, this kind of ambiguous action turns out to be as the public speculates, and there are no significant reasons to tell our countrymen, then we will deeply regret it for the Northeast Fleet.</p>
<p>If their purpose is only to drive out Shen Honglie, and the purpose of driving out Shen is only due to back pay and mistreatment of subordinates, then they should have listed Shen's crimes in advance and appealed to the Central Government, awaiting the Central Government's fair decision. Now that they have not done so, and have rashly acted freely and sailed away from Qingdao, then after sailing away from Qingdao, they should quickly impose strict self-discipline and avoid any further rash actions. If Shen is indeed unpopular, the Central Government will take appropriate action. Moreover, in terms of the fleet's history, the Bohai Fleet has been under the command of the Northeast authorities since its northward departure from Guangdong. Although it nominally submitted to the Central Government after the Northern Expedition and unification, it actually formed its own system. This easily caused division regarding Shen. However, today, the Northeast has been seized by a powerful enemy, and the name of the Northeast is now unified under the Central Government. Where will the fleet's departure from its defense area lead? Therefore, the fleet should be aware of the importance of its own relationship and consider its actions carefully and thoroughly. The Central Government's handling of this matter should be fair and swift, and it should not be allowed to drag on and create unexpected complications.</p>

<p>Japan Is Quite Uneasy and Is Studying Countermeasures</p>
<p>Australia Also Plans to Increase Import Taxes on Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Tokyo According to a telegram from Consul-General Matingui in Sydney, Australia, on the 29th, the Australian Federal Government, which recently imposed high tariffs on Japanese-made rubber shoes, now plans to implement high tariffs on Japanese goods such as cotton products, towels, pottery, light bulbs, and ammonium sulfate. Japan has protested to Britain, demanding that it stop its colonies from excluding Japanese goods. However, Britain has no sincerity, and Japan has had to express a firm opinion. (29th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo According to a telegram from London to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Ishii visited Foreign Secretary Simon on the 27th to draw attention to Britain's increased tariffs in its colonies, saying that this matter is irritating the anti-British sentiment of the Japanese people and has a negative impact on the friendly relations between the two countries, shaking the long-standing friendly relations between Britain and Japan, which is very regrettable. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the financial situation in India is such that even the British government cannot interfere. Therefore, this measure was taken by the Indian government, and the same is true for the Straits Settlements. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials felt displeased with Foreign Secretary Simon's excuse, so they are currently studying countermeasures. (29th Denstu Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo Japanese representatives Fukai and Ambassador Matsudaira separately met with British authorities on the 27th to discuss the issue of consultations between Britain, Japan, and India. According to their report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 29th, the contents are as follows: Ambassador Matsudaira met with British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Robert Vansittart, hoping that the British government would quickly select an Indian representative and grant them full authority to consult with Japan and India, so as to avoid adverse effects on relations between the two countries. Representative Fukai also visited Foreign Secretary Simon at the same time, informing him of the same content as discussed with Prime Minister MacDonald in their previous meeting. Simon replied that the British government cannot interfere with India's increase in tariffs. This time, the increase in tariffs was definitely not instigated by Britain to target Japan. As for Singapore and Malaya, which are British colonies, they have different constitutions, and France cannot interfere either. (29th Jiji News Agency)</p>

<p>London This morning, the activities of the World Economic Conference were completely controlled by the sharp rise and fall of currency values. Professor Moley, President Roosevelt's trusted advisor, began his activities today and discussed the issue of currency stability with the US delegation. The delegations of other countries also held meetings, the main one being the meeting of the European gold standard countries. The British delegation, led by MacDonald and Chamberlain, is making every effort to coordinate the opinions of all parties. However, they now feel that declaring the pound's link to gold will isolate the United States and the economic conference will collapse as a whole. Furthermore, the gold standard countries are deeply concerned that the pound's value will be lowered by the dollar. If this happens, the commerce of the gold standard countries will be severely negatively impacted. The currency issue is currently stalled, and much of the conference's work has actually been suspended as a result. The US delegation has not yet been involved in formal discussions, but they are being informed of the progress at all times. According to recent news, French Finance Minister Bonnet will propose that if a compromise on currency stability cannot be reached within a week, the conference should be adjourned. It is said that there is some basis for this statement. MacDonald met with Hull again today, urging him to pay attention to the seriousness of the situation. It is rumored that the US delegation has cabled President Roosevelt, suggesting that he take all appropriate measures as soon as he deems appropriate. However, the authorities subsequently issued a denial. At the same time, Cox, chairman of the Monetary and Financial Committee, reiterated his refusal to discuss currency stability and advised Europeans to find their own solutions. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London Those seeking general currency stability at the World Economic Conference are now greatly alarmed by the rapid decline of the dollar. The representatives of the European gold standard countries, while claiming to support the gold standard, surrounded British Prime Minister MacDonald, seeking British assistance. However, they achieved nothing other than obtaining Prime Minister's promise to give preferential attention. The British government seems unwilling to take sides in the conflict between the United States and the European gold standard countries, and is even less willing to take any action given the dollar's wild fluctuations. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London France has effectively issued an ultimatum to the economic conference, warning that if a currency stabilization agreement cannot be reached within a week, the French representative will propose an indefinite adjournment. However, while France has issued an ultimatum, Britain also tends to join the European gold standard countries, while the United States still adheres to its original policy, refusing to participate in any stabilization agreement at this time.</p>
<p>The French ultimatum was sent to Conference Chairman MacDonald. It is said that the gold standard defense alliance of all major countries and other allied countries such as Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland all agreed to this move during repeated private talks.</p>
<p>This afternoon, it was learned that the French ultimatum was sent out yesterday. As a result, the US representatives reiterated their stance of refusing to stabilize the currency today. As a result, everyone at the conference looked worried, because they had previously speculated that the US dollar's sharp decline might mean that the US President had considered stabilizing the currency, but they did not expect the US representatives to still make a statement of rejection.</p>
<p>Representatives of the gold standard countries, such as French Finance Minister Bonnet, Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans, and representatives from Switzerland, Italy, and the Netherlands, held a secret meeting this morning. They then met with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Finance Minister Chamberlain. However, both meetings failed to produce concrete results. French Finance Minister Bonnet told reporters after meeting with British representatives that he had not made any progress, but said that they would meet again this afternoon. US representatives told reporters after hearing the news of the French ultimatum that today was the darkest day of the conference. The representatives of the six major countries who had originally planned to draft a currency plan after the United States refused to reconsider its policy on stabilization were also postponed, as it was felt that it would be useless to continue discussing a plan to prevent currency fluctuations at this time. This afternoon, it was widely rumored in the conference lounge that British Prime Minister MacDonald had sent a personal letter to President Roosevelt, urging him to take steps to stabilize the US dollar as soon as possible within the possible scope of the conference. It is now believed that this extraordinary move by the British Prime Minister was the result of France's reiteration of the ultimatum it sent yesterday this morning. It was also heard that during this morning's meeting of gold standard countries, Belgian representative Francqui was the most激烈, declaring that unless the Belgians were assisted in maintaining the gold standard, Belgium would have no choice but to withdraw from the conference. In addition, other representatives also expressed that they urgently needed to return to their countries to deal with the increasingly critical financial situation. However, Britain is now firmly leaning towards the gold standard countries. The British delegation sent a letter to the conference secretariat last night, strongly advocating the need to curb monetary speculation and fluctuations.</p>
<p>As for the US statement of no change in its attitude towards the stabilization issue, it was issued after US Undersecretary of State Moley met with US delegation advisor, renowned financier Warburg, and US Treasury Department advisor Sprague for two hours. According to a spokesman for the US delegation, there is no prospect of the US dollar being stabilized in the near future, but he acknowledged that Sprague may submit a new plan to the US President during his term. (29th Kuomintang News Agency)</p>
<p>London The World Economic Conference has effectively come to a standstill, awaiting two important statements so that the conference can make real progress.</p>
<p>One is the plan on Australia's stabilization of world wheat prices. It is said that the Australian government has already issued instructions, but the Australian delegation is keeping it secret. It is believed that its contents should provide some kind of plan to reduce the acreage of cultivation, but it is said that the nature of the proposal is quite lenient, so that wheat farmers will not suffer more difficulties, and it is attached with several necessary reservations. If European wheat producing countries cannot implement the same harmony, Australia can protect its own interests. The other is to expect the US delegation to make a statement on stabilizing currency, so that Europe will not have to engage in an exchange rate war with the United States.

<p>London Recently, the continued decline of the US dollar has caused great panic among Britain and some countries that have gained trade benefits by depreciating their currencies, fearing that they will suffer significant losses. Therefore, the French delegation seized the opportunity to win over Britain, proposing to stabilize the exchange rate between gold pounds and francs first, so as to form a European united front against the United States. Last night, there were various proposals to induce Britain to join the European currency plan, and there were also requests for Britain to support the gold standard countries. Judging from the current situation, many believe that if Britain is willing to use its stable pound fund to support the franc, the Bank of France will be able to assist the Dutch currency. In this way, the currencies of major European countries can be stabilized on a more flexible basis and prevent the dollar from falling again. The US delegation has not yet expressed any opinion on these proposals, while the French delegation firmly believes that no substantial agreement can be reached on any economic or monetary issue until the United States agrees to some kind of stabilization plan.

<p>Britain's Attitude Wavering and Cautious</p>
<p>London The only significant developments at today's economic conference are two: one is the extreme pessimism of the French delegation, claiming that the conference has failed to reach any unconditional agreement even within the smallest of subcommittees; the other is the shape of a fierce exchange rate war between Europe and the United States. Major representatives all said that unless US Undersecretary of State Moley can maintain his reputation as an "extraordinary person," Britain will be induced to stabilize the prices of the gold pound and various European gold standard currencies, thereby forcing the United States to accept the de facto stabilization of currencies, as the instability of the US currency has brought the economic conference to a standstill. However, as of today, Britain is still wavering, and it has not yet been decided whether to support US monetary policy or join the European group and agree on the exchange rate between the pound, the Dutch guilder, and the franc. However, today's sharp decline in the US dollar has forced Britain to make a decision, as industrialists are generally panicked by the rapid disappearance of the trade benefits they gained after depreciating the pound.

<p>Yan Huiqing Delivers a Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>(London) Chinese representative Dr. Yan Huiqing delivered a radio broadcast today entitled "China's Importance in the World Economy," which was listened to with great attention. Dr. Yan said that China deeply feels the urgent need for a new era of industrialization and needs large quantities of metals and machinery to develop China's latent wealth. China is a fertile ground for daring investors. Those who are prepared to assist China in economic activities will be rewarded. The British economic survey mission to China in 1930 has stated that China's foreign trade can be increased to the same level as India, which can increase world foreign trade by 300 million pounds per year. However, which Western countries will achieve this result with their vision and enterprising spirit? This is the question. China is a silver using country, but most of its imports come from gold using countries, and importers feel unable to maintain the amount of imports. China has to remit gold due to foreign debts and reparations. At this point, Dr. Yan listed figures to show the serious impact of unstable silver prices and economic instability on China, and said that any plan that can stabilize and raise silver prices will increase China's purchasing power and promote its demand for machinery and cotton textiles. The Chinese delegation fully agrees with the British representative's opinion at the World Economic Conference that the greatest need today is to raise world prices and stabilize the currencies of various countries.

According to the opinion of a senior conference official, the impact of Professor Moley's arrival in London will be felt by the end of this week.

<p>(London) Japanese representative Ambassador Matsudaira argued in the commercial policy subcommittee of the Economic and Trade Committee on the 28th for the unconditional application of the most-favored-nation clause, indirectly attacking the attitude of the British and Indian governments in excluding Japanese goods. Matsudaira said that Japan's tariff rate is very low compared to other countries, and there is no hindrance to international trade. Japan has always adhered to the principle of free trade and has tried its best to eliminate economic nationalism. In this position, Japan hopes that the economic conference will achieve international cooperation on economic and financial matters. Japan believes that the most regrettable thing is that a certain country (referring to Britain) raised tariffs before and after the opening of the economic conference, violating the fundamental spirit of the conference. This attitude hinders international trade. Japan believes that the early removal of such trade barriers is the fundamental spirit of this conference. However, a method of raising tariffs uniformly in all countries is beneficial to countries with high tariff rates and detrimental to countries with low tariff rates. Japan cannot agree to this method. (28th Jiji News Agency)</p>

<p>(London) Apart from the second subcommittee of the Monetary Committee, all committees of the World Economic Conference held closed-door meetings today. The second subcommittee considered its proposals on the use of gold and the percentage of gold reserves. The BIS's Ley said today that this subcommittee aims to promote the restoration of the gold standard as the international monetary standard. The Monetary Committee discussed the amended text or alternative clauses of the Pittman Amendment at today's closed-door meeting. This new clause was passed after slight word modifications, stating that gold is not required for domestic circulation in modern situations, but only as a reserve for central bank liabilities and to meet foreign claims arising from imbalances in foreign accounts. Therefore, there is no need to inject gold coins or gold notes into domestic circulation. Another clause states that the gold reserves of central banks should have greater flexibility, but a ratio of 25% should be regarded as a sufficient minimum. When the above clauses were debated, Ley advocated passage. Egyptian representative Cooke said that some countries, especially small countries, have a concept that gold has an absolute value.

<p>(London) There has been no progress in the wheat dispute at the World Economic Conference today. How to reduce the acreage of wheat fields is still the main point of contention. Several countries in Europe have now banned the import of foreign wheat, so it is difficult to expect progress without obtaining some kind of guarantee for sales in the European market.

<p>(Tokyo) As the transfer conference for the Chinese Eastern Railway began discussing prices, the Soviet side, in order to gain an advantageous position, initially proposed an exorbitant valuation. Negotiations may encounter disputes due to the valuation issue. Japan and "Manchukuo" are determined to refute it based on the following reasons: 1) The value of the Eastern Railway has decreased after the Manchurian Incident; 2) The operating performance of the Chinese Eastern Railway has declined after the Manchurian Incident, resulting in monthly losses of two to three million rubles; 3) The various facilities of the Chinese Eastern Railway have not been repaired and are allowed to decay, and depreciation has not been accounted for. Therefore, it is a mistake to estimate the value based on construction funds; the valuation should be based on actual value. (Dentsu Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>Establishing a Silver Exchange in Tokyo</p>
<p>In Opposition to London, Seeking Cooperation with the United States</p>
<p>The Goal is to Dominate Our Financial Market</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Upper House member Kinjiro Yamazaki and several financial leaders are planning to establish a silver exchange in Tokyo. It is reported that they have drafted a concrete proposal and submitted it to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for approval. Their purpose is to dominate our country's financial market and subject our economy to the hands of Japanese financial magnates. According to the founders, China and Manchuria are silver standard countries with very low living standards. Controlling the price of silver means controlling the entire Chinese economy. Japan wants to dominate the Far East and must start with the economy. The United States is the world's silver producer, and it is possible to cooperate with the United States on the silver issue to jointly resist the British silver market. (Hua Dian, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Ministry of Industry Requests Ministry of Finance to Amend Customs Tariffs <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry believes that many of the tariff rates for various goods stipulated in the current tariff regulations do not conform to the actual situation. For example, raw silk, tung oil, soybean oil, soybean cake, porcelain, and livestock by-products, which are sold abroad in large quantities, are subject to export taxes equal to or higher than those of ordinary products. On the other hand, the import tariff rates for industrial products that are scarce domestically, such as lead blocks and iron wire, exceed those of finished products. All of these factors hinder the development of domestic industry and urgently need to be revised. Therefore, based on the principle of tariff protection policy, a plan for increasing, decreasing, or exempting tariffs has been drafted, requesting the Ministry of Finance to consider amending the current import and export tariffs. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has submitted the plan to the Legislative Yuan for discussion and integration into the new tariff proposal. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, yesterday six Soviet cavalrymen crossed the "Manchukuo" border near Taipingzhen (transliterated), about twenty miles from Dongning (transliterated). They stayed overnight with a Korean man. The next morning, they captured seven Soviet escapees and retreated back into Russian territory. It is reported that there are more than four hundred anti-Manchu troops in the area, who are very active and have considerable contact with the Red Army. It is rumored that the Soviet authorities have promised the anti-Manchu troops in the area a considerable reward for capturing Soviet escapees. The Red Army's border defense policy is detrimental to the order and prestige of "Manchukuo." Therefore, the Manchukuo authorities will lodge a strong protest with the Soviet Union.

<h3 id="e80">Negotiations to Continue Separately After the Disarmament Conference Adjourns <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 29th: The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference discussed the issue of adjourning the Disarmament Conference this morning. Chairman Henderson explained the necessity of adjournment, stating that negotiations are already underway in London, and that certain points of contention may be difficult to resolve through diplomatic channels. Some delegations believe that adjournment is equivalent to ending the conference. The chairman strongly defended the decision, stating that the conference will continue its work, but in a more appropriate form to achieve success. German delegate Nadolny spoke at length, stating that Germany is prepared to negotiate in London, and declared that the obligations of the Disarmament Conference should be to re-examine the British disarmament plan and negotiate with the various delegations in Geneva, as Chairman Henderson's travels make it difficult to discuss methods. Nadolny expressed regret for the Bureau's decision to adjourn the Disarmament Conference until October 16, stating that the people cannot understand the decision to adjourn, as it is tantamount to abandoning the disarmament mission and declaring the Disarmament Conference dead. He also stated that the governments that approve this decision should bear full responsibility, while Germany will continue to do its utmost to avoid the cessation of the Disarmament Conference. U.S. representative Wilson supported Chairman Henderson's proposal to adjourn, while British representative Cadogan also supported the procedure proposed by the Bureau. French representative Massigli stated that although his personal wishes were not the same, he still accepted the Bureau's proposal, and that the urgent task at hand is to find new methods of working. In response to German representative Nadolny's statement on government responsibility, Massigli stated that in the current situation, governments must consider carefully in order to fully understand the reasons for this serious decision, which is clear to everyone. He also stated that public opinion knows that if all countries are willing to cooperate peacefully, the outcome of whether the Disarmament Conference is adjourned or not will be the same, as no situation should be created anywhere that is contrary to the spirit proposed in Geneva. In short, the responsibility for the failure of the Disarmament Conference can only be determined later when Henderson consults separately with the governments of various countries. At that time, if there is any obstacle to the success of these consultations, there will be no escaping responsibility. Hungary supported Germany's proposal, while Italy supported adjournment. German delegate Nadolny rose again to speak, stating that the General Assembly's discussions cannot change his belief. He represented his government in advocating for the drafting of a disarmament convention as soon as possible, which "Germany, regardless of its government, will faithfully fulfill." Chairman Henderson then stated that the decision to adjourn had been almost unanimously approved, and announced the adjournment of the General Committee. From then on, Chairman Henderson will preside over separate negotiations, which will begin tomorrow.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 29th: U.S. President Roosevelt's recalled representative to Europe, Davis, traveled to the Atlantic coast today to board the President's yacht and meet with Roosevelt to report on the situation of the Disarmament Conference, stating that European public opinion is gradually supporting disarmament, but the future depends on the stability of the German government. U.S. President Roosevelt believes that the reason the United States agreed to consult with Europe is entirely based on Europe's disarmament. Therefore, he instructed Davis to return to Europe within a week and redouble his efforts for peace and disarmament in accordance with his recent proposals.</p>

Therefore, Prime Minister Saito is also deeply aware of the Finance Minister's plight and will personally persuade him to stay on the 27th, and will also visit Admiral Okada to inquire about his true intentions.</p>

<p>Strict Measures Against Terrorism</p>
<p>(Reuters, Vienna, 29th) The Austrian government is now prepared to adopt new sanction measures against the terrorist tactics employed by the National Socialist Party within Austria. The measures taken by the Austrian government to suppress the National Socialist Party have been moderate so far, as the Austrian authorities feared that strict measures would deter travelers. However, as the terrorist acts of the National Socialist Party have intensified, the Austrian government has decided to adopt strict legal sanctions against anyone who endangers Austria's political stability. The Austrian government will hold meetings today and tomorrow to discuss how to deal with the National Socialist Party. It is reported that if the actions of the National Socialist Party endanger people's lives, the perpetrators will be sentenced to death. Some members of the cabinet have suggested arresting and detaining National Socialist Party members in one place, but the cabinet members have not yet fully agreed on this matter. However, there is unanimous agreement on the need to quickly stop the terrorist acts of the National Socialist Party. Although the National Socialist Party's newspapers have been closed, they have now resumed publication, albeit in a slightly altered form. The authorities plan to issue regulations for newspaper registration, and once these regulations are promulgated, the government can prohibit the National Socialist Party's newspapers from continuing to publish by refusing to issue licenses. It is also reported that the Austrian authorities plan to expel all National Socialist Party spies who have stayed in Austria by changing their names or other methods.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Innsbruck, 28th) Innsbruck, the capital of Tyrol, Austria, has recently experienced repeated acts of violence by the National Socialist Party. Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss plans to visit tomorrow to inspect the area. The authorities have taken strict precautions to protect Dollfuss. Auxiliary police patrols have been doubled along the way, and all vehicles have been stopped and inspected. In addition to the regular army, eighty-nine squads of the Tyrol Volunteer Corps will serve as Dollfuss's guards. Well-informed sources say that in recent times, various provinces, especially Tyrol, have shown a tendency to lean towards foreign forces. Dollfuss's trip aims to curb this trend.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 28th) If the Catholic Center Party refuses to join the National Socialist Party or completely disengages from politics, it will soon be banned. It is now believed that Vice-Chancellor von Papen's visit to Rome is to persuade the Pope to prohibit Catholic priests from participating in political movements. As for the Catholic Party's members in the Reichstag and the Federal Council, if they do not join the National Socialist Party, they will automatically withdraw. Today, Berlin National Socialist Party leader Goebbels gave a powerful speech in Stuttgart, urging the Catholic Party to dissolve itself voluntarily if it wants to avoid government action. He also stated that Germany no longer allows the Center Party to continue to exist. "We are doing a good thing for the Catholic Church by dissolving the Center Party.

<p>Breach of the Hanyang Main Dike, Various Counties Report Danger</p>
<p>Provincial Government Submits Report on Flood Control to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>(Correspondence from Hankou) The Yangtze River water in Wuhan has been rising for several days, and the trees on the Longhe Embankment are submerged in the vast expanse of water. Although it has not yet caused a major disaster, it is still alarming. The upstream water flow has now eased slightly, but Dongting and Poyang Lakes are overflowing simultaneously, and the river flow has nowhere to go, causing concerns about breaches in various embankments. Today, the 27th, according to a compilation of reports from various sources, there has been a collapse of the Xinhao Embankment in Hanyang, a breach of the Shuanghe Embankment, a collapse of Zhangjiadun, and seepage at Xintankou, Yongfeng Sluice Gate, Fuben Embankment, and Hama Isle. Xinhao Embankment is the county's largest civil embankment, bordering the Yangtze River to the east and the Dun River to the north, with approximately 17,000 mu of farmland within the embankment. Once it loses its protection, the losses are incalculable. In Wuchang, leakage has been discovered at the Zhoujiazui Sluice Gate downstream of Jinkou. In addition, the Hubei Lake Embankment is experiencing the simultaneous surge of the river and lake, posing extreme danger. Jizhiang is suffering from water accumulation and embankment alarms. The new embankment along the river is gradually collapsing, bringing the total to three breached embankments and seventeen dangerous ones. Wang, President of the Executive Yuan, is extremely concerned about the rising water in Hubei Province. On the 25th, he telegraphed Xia Douyin, Chairman of the Provincial Government, to inquire about the recent conditions of the embankments. Xia responded with an urgent telegram on the 26th, and formally submitted a report on the 27th, which reads as follows: "Report on reporting matters. I received a telegram from Your Excellency stating that according to reports, the river water has risen sharply, and instructing me to report on the embankment situation, etc. I am deeply grateful for Your Excellency's concern for the people's livelihood. Upon investigation, the Yangtze River and Han River areas experienced continuous heavy rains from late May to early June, and the water level has been increasing non-stop. This government is deeply concerned that the completion date for the embankment repairs undertaken by the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau has not yet been reported. We intended to implement temporary flood control measures and were about to announce them when we received an order from the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, issuing the 13 articles of the Yangtze River and Han River main embankment flood control measures drafted by the National Economic Commission, instructing us to comply immediately. After submitting the report to the Provincial Government Committee meeting, it was concluded that the flood control measures would shift the heavy responsibility of flood control to the local governments, with the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau only playing an assisting role, making it difficult to fully implement the measures. Therefore, we telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, detailing that the province of Hubei depends on its embankments for its livelihood, the local vitality has not yet recovered, and the flood control funds and materials should be provided by the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau, and they should be responsible for handling all practical matters. At the same time, Li Fanyi, who is also the Director of the Construction Department, was publicly recommended to go to Nanchang to personally meet with Chiang Kai-shek to request instructions. Seeing that the rate of water increase exceeded the water level of the same month 20 years ago, we first announced the temporary flood control measures that this government had planned to prevent accidents. Subsequently, on June 11, we received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, instructing Li to work with Yang Silian, Director of the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau, to revise the measures and submit them for review. On June 15, we received another telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, instructing us to send personnel to attend the Five-Province Flood Prevention Committee jointly formed by the Yangtze River Waterway Commission, which was followed accordingly. On June 20, Li Fanyi, who is also the Director of the Construction Department, submitted the flood control measures and budget documents that he had negotiated and signed with the Director of the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau, and proposed the resolution of the 32nd Committee Meeting of this government, which was revised, passed, and circulated on June 21 for compliance. The county magistrates of the embankment counties were appointed as flood control committee members and flood prevention inspectors, assigned to various locations, and implemented the work. Fearing that the counties and cities would dispute material funds during flood control, overspend, falsely report in a panic, and delay in handling matters, five measures that must be followed during flood control were formulated and ordered to be followed by the Wuhan Municipal Government and the governments of 35 embankment counties. While preparing to submit the reports, we received the previous telegram. In addition to reporting the general situation in the previous telegram and reporting on future flood control matters one after another, we have compiled the relevant documents, stated the reasons and process, and submitted them for review and instructions. Furthermore, according to the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau's report on May 25, calculating the water level based on the Wu Song basic horizontal line, the water level in Wuchang was 22.03 meters. On June 24, it was 26.20 meters, an increase of 4.17 meters. The water level was relatively stable on the 25th and 26th. In Wuchang, the Construction Department has joined with various agencies to organize a temporary flood control committee for the provincial capital. In Hankou, the municipal government has also reported on the sectional flood control measures for the embankments along the river and the Zhanggong Embankment. As for the county embankments, the reported collapses are the Xinba of Jinkou, the Zhang Huinan Embankment of Shishou, and the Xinhao Embankment of Hanyang. A total of 17 embankments are reported to be in danger. I have compiled a list for submission and request your review." Furthermore, the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau was ordered to provide instructions on flood prevention measures, stating, "Upon investigation, after the General Headquarters issued the distribution of materials and funds to the government, we found that the funds and materials were too few and feared that they would be insufficient. We requested that the National Economic Commission be requested to quickly allocate the remaining 100,000 yuan of the original 200,000 yuan flood control funds requested by the bureau to meet the urgent needs. The bureau's allocation of funds and materials should be determined based on the length of the embankment, the degree of danger, and the transportation situation. For example, the Old Dragon Embankment is far away in Xiangyang and has been repeatedly reported to be in danger. The Jingjiang Embankment Engineering Bureau has jurisdiction over hundreds of miles of embankments, which are related to the livelihoods of more than ten counties, but only 2,000 yuan has been allocated, which is far too little. The Shuyang Engineering Office and the Shayang Engineering Office are full of dangerous projects, and the Second Engineering Office, which includes Wuhan, is also feared to have insufficient funds. Additional funds should be appropriately allocated when the second installment of funds is received. The distribution of materials and storage locations should be based on the convenience of transportation. In areas with difficult transportation and a lack of materials, more materials should be allocated. In areas with convenient transportation and easier purchases, more loans should be provided. Materials should also be pre-stored in suitable locations outside the locations of the various engineering offices as backup support for the engineering offices. The procedures for issuing funds and materials must be specified, and they must be prompt and practical, without any waste or abuse. In areas where wooden piles are not easily available, some wooden piles should also be prepared, or designated purchasing locations should be pre-assigned, in case of emergency. In short, this year's water level is too high and continues to rise, and future disasters are unpredictable. Flood control work is not only related to the livelihoods of a province and a county, but also to the entire national economy. Proper command and appropriate allocation will result in less cost and greater efficiency. Otherwise, even with a lot of money, there will be little real effect. I urge you to immediately cable the preparation office to allocate the original flood control funds in full and to quickly plan the most appropriate and convenient methods for allocating funds and materials in accordance with the above points to cope with the situation."

<p>Manchurian Railway Supports Research Funding of 45,000 Yuan</p>
<p>False State Establishes Daxing Joint Stock Company</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Recently, Japan plans to carry out large-scale immigration to the Northeast. The Manchurian Railway has designated a research fund of 45,000 yuan, with a term of two years. The research focuses on the food and nutritional components of the Northeast after the Japanese immigrants arrive, the digestion and absorption by the Japanese and their storage methods, how model houses in the Northeast should be transformed to suit Japanese living, and whether the clothes of the Northeast and Mongolia meet the physical requirements of the Japanese. Starting in June of this year, the Japanese Ministry of the Army began training a group of 500 immigrants in Gunma Prefecture, receiving military training for armed immigrants. At the same time, the Institute of Hygiene, in collaboration with the Manchurian Medical University, is conducting preliminary research on whether the clothing, food, and housing of the Northeast and Mongolia are suitable for Japanese immigrants. These immigration steps are solid evidence of the Japanese intention to permanently occupy the Northeast. In addition, the false organizations created by the Japanese have now established the Daxing Joint Stock Company, an affiliate of the Central Bank of Manchuria. The scale is very large, and its business includes seven types of operations: pawnshops, oil mills, distilleries, food, flour mills, papermaking, and forestry. The capital is set at 7 million yuan. The head office is located in Changchun, with branches in Fengtian, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Qiqihar. Because the company is the valuation agency for agricultural products in the Manchurian state and the profit-making agency for large enterprises in Manchuria, it starts with food first. This system is exactly the same as the East India Company operated by the British in India. The Japanese goal is to start with commerce, absorb Manchurian capital, and develop Manchurian enterprises. Although the Daxing Joint Stock Company is of a national nature of the Manchurian state, the real boss behind the Manchurian state is Japan, which is no different from the Japanese operating it. This kind of commercial combination of economic systems can be transformed into a political organization, so the Daxing Joint Stock Company in the eyes of the Japanese is like the second East India Company, containing political properties.

<h3 id="e102">Fang Zhenwu Issues Circular Telegrams for Several Days <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>(Correspondence from Beiping) Fang Zhenwu has repeatedly issued circular telegrams in Zhangjiakou for several days, making many proposals on the current situation. The following is a summary of the main points of each telegram: (1) Zhen Telegram opposes the cotton and wheat loan, stating that Song Ziwen, with the mission of the Nanjing government, borrowed 50 million US dollars from the American Finance Rehabilitation Corporation to buy cotton at 40% and wheat at 10%. Cotton and wheat are surplus goods in the United States. Moreover, in recent years, China's agricultural products have been oversupplied, grain prices have fallen, and when grains are cheap and hurt farmers, the economy will inevitably collapse. If a large amount of imported cotton and wheat are dumped again, it is tantamount to the capitalist countries absorbing the blood of our people and oppressing China's economy. Using this as a financial element is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst and hastening death. Zhenwu is untalented, a member of the Central Committee, driven by conscience, and for the sake of justice. He is determined to oppose Song Ziwen's cotton and wheat loan to the death. (2) Yuan Telegram advocates thorough resistance to Japan, stating that recently Japanese soldiers within the pass have continued to press on the border, and the situation in Eastern Chahar is tense again, which is heartbreaking. Hearing this makes one's hair stand on end. Zhenwu has stationed troops outside the border, determined to resist Japan, and is preparing for war without hesitation. As long as he has a breath left, he will swear to wield his armor and fight a mortal battle with the Japanese puppet troops, implementing the proposition of resisting Japan and saving the country, and will not make any compromises. He will seek justice for the country and fight for the survival of the nation, regardless of success or failure. (3) Shan Telegram states that China has vast land and abundant resources, and its culture and materials are unparalleled in the world. In the past, during the Qin Shi Huang, Han Wu Emperor, and Tang Taizong eras, their prestige reached everywhere, and all surrendered. But today, the country is fragmented, and families are displaced. This is due to the wicked Japanese chaebols, who have abandoned the affection of the same script and race and implemented their aggressive strategy. However, our country's authorities have failed to rise to the occasion, giving people an opportunity to take advantage. Zhenwu has been engaged in revolution for thirty years, with saving the country as a prerequisite and protecting the people as a priority. He vows to lead tens of thousands of troops, drive out the Japanese pirates, and return our territory, implementing the proposition of resisting Japan and saving the country. He will not stop fighting until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Guangcheng Embankment in Anhui Province Collapses <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Many Other Embankments are Also in Danger</p>
<p>(Correspondence from Anqing) Recently, the Yangtze River water level has risen sharply. According to the water level in Anqing, it has now reached over 38 feet, and the situation is precarious. Anhui Province has suffered a severe flood in 1920, and the damage has not yet recovered. How can it withstand another disaster? The provincial government and the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments have ordered various counties to defend and sent personnel to supervise and guide. Liu Yiyan, Director of the Construction Department, recently personally inspected the embankments in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Ma Lingfu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, acting on behalf of the Chairman of the Provincial Government, also accompanied various provincial committee members to inspect the upper reaches on the 21st of the month and continued to inspect the lower reaches on the 24th and 25th, returning to the province on the morning of the 26th to attend the provincial government's extended memorial week and report the results of the inspection. The main points of Ma's report, combined with recent developments, are described as follows: (1) Ma Hua Embankment is related to the water conservancy of seven counties in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, with a length of over a hundred miles in Anhui. Recently, the embankment body is still seven or eight feet above the water surface, and there may be no danger at present. The provincial government has sent two members from the Civil Affairs Department and one member from the Construction Department to investigate and protect it. (2) Baoxing Embankment is located east of Huayang Town in Wangjiang County. The embankment along the river is in good condition, but the transverse embankment is thin and cannot withstand wind and waves. The embankment directors should be ordered to quickly repair it. (3) Guangcheng Embankment is located upstream of Anqing, with over 800 zhang of sandy embankment along the river. There are many wave holes at the foot of the embankment, and the embankment surface has been eroded by water in many places, making it very dangerous. Ma ordered the Huaining County Magistrate to supervise the repair after returning to the province. Unfortunately, the embankment collapsed on the afternoon of the 26th during a storm and heavy rain, causing considerable damage. (4) Guangshu Embankment is located opposite Anqing, under the jurisdiction of Dongji County. The river embankment is currently about four feet above the water surface, and the embankment body is still solid. However, the eastern embankment and the Yangjia Yin area are very dangerous. Huang Yingzhong, a member of the Construction Department who accompanied Ma, was left at the embankment to conduct a detailed survey and supervise the county to handle it. (5) Guangji Embankment is related to the food supply of Huai and Tong counties. The current embankment surface is about five feet above the water, and firewood and grass bundles are being used to block the waves. However, a section near Majiawo has a sandy embankment and may not be able to withstand the wind and waves. The embankment committee should be ordered to gather manpower to strengthen protection and allocate funds to purchase emergency materials. (6) Chenjiazhou is located east of Guijia Dam in Tongcheng. The river embankment is still strong, and the embankment surface is about six feet above the water. However, the adjacent Xiadacheng Embankment and Zhijia Yin area are currently low and thin. Xiadacheng Embankment is 300 zhang long and only about two feet above the water. If the water surges in, it will affect dozens of miles. Shi Huacheng, a technician from the Construction Department, should be sent to conduct a detailed survey and also inspect the Guanzhuang Embankment in Tongling, the Baoda Embankment in Fanchang, the Xijiang Embankment along the Mabao Embankment in Wuhu, and the Daguan Embankment in Dangtu. (7) Datong Embankment is located east of Meigeng Town in Dongji. The lower section of the river embankment is not very strong, especially the Laoniu in the first embankment and the river embankment, which is only one or two feet above the water, are the most dangerous. The acting county magistrate should be telegraphed to pay special attention. (8) Guanzhuang Embankment is located in Tongling, also known as Renfeng Embankment. It has a large area, and both the river embankment and the inner embankment are very strong. The river embankment is about six feet above the water. However, the dam embankment head needs to be rebuilt. Shi Huacheng, a technician from the Construction Department, should be sent to conduct a survey. (9) Huangsitan is under the jurisdiction of Wuwei County and serves as a barrier for seven counties, including Hehan, Shulu, Chaohu, and Hehe, and is located on the Wei of the Yangtze River. It has been collapsing over the years, and the current embankment surface is only a little over four feet above the water. Moreover, the lower section is over 300 zhang long and is only two feet above the water, requiring urgent protection. Zhang Bochang, a member of the Civil Affairs Department, and Wang Deyu, a technician from the Construction Department, should be ordered to station at the embankment to guide protection and conduct detailed surveys upstream and downstream.

<h3 id="e104">Frequent Alarms Regarding the North Lu Canal <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Construction Department Dispatches Personnel to Various Counties to Supervise and Expedite Emergency Reinforcements</p>
<p>Jinan dispatch: The water level in the North Lu Canal (i.e., the Wei River) rose sharply the day before yesterday, reaching 29 meters, very close to the danger line. Eleven dangerous spots have been discovered along the river near Yanzhuang, and alarms are frequently being raised. Upon receiving the report, Zhang Honglie, the head of the Construction Department, considering that the North Lu area has suffered from frequent floods in recent years, and the water level is rising so steeply even before the summer flood season, urgently ordered the intensification of emergency reinforcements to prevent accidents. He specifically dispatched technical assistants Qu Changqian to Guantao, Sun Weihan to Linqing, Yu Zhuntai to Xiajin, technician Sun Ziyun to Wucheng, Yao Xintian to De County, and committee member Zuo Shaoji to En County to supervise and expedite the emergency reinforcements. In addition to informing the county magistrates of the six counties by telegram, he ordered the technical assistants and technicians to depart immediately and formulated eight measures, ordering the technical assistants and technicians to inspect the river works conditions for any dangerous sections upon arriving in each county, together with the county magistrate, the head of the Fourth Section, and the district chiefs. They are to set up water level gauges and record the water level fluctuations, mutually informing neighboring counties by telephone for prevention. The necessary labor and materials are to be the responsibility of the affected districts. In addition, a telegram was sent to Wucheng County Magistrate Zhen Guangyuan to forward to Sun Ziyun, approving the temporary use of funds needed for the dangerous sections in Yanzhuang, to be reimbursed by the county magistrate later, to meet urgent needs. The arrangements were extremely thorough, and the river works may be free from danger. Furthermore, technician Yao Xintian is currently supervising the construction of a sand embankment in En County and Wucheng (the two counties previously engaged in armed clashes due to embankment construction). In a few more days, the embankment construction can be completed. If the sand embankment is successful, the flood disasters in En and Wucheng counties can be reduced. The following are the eight measures from the Construction Department's instructions assigning special commissioners to be stationed in various counties along the river to supervise and guide emergency reinforcement:</p>
<p>(1) After the committee member arrives at the county, he shall immediately convene a meeting with the county magistrate, the head of the Fourth Section, and the district chiefs along the river to discuss emergency reinforcement measures, organization, and procedures, and submit them to the department for record. (2) After the committee member arrives at the county, he must inspect along the river for one week together with the head of the Fourth Section. If there are dangerous sections, he should immediately notify the county magistrate to implement emergency reinforcement measures quickly according to regulations. (3) The labor and materials used for emergency reinforcement should be the responsibility of the affected districts to raise. (4) The Fourth Section of the county government should select a suitable location to install a water level gauge and assign a dedicated person to record the water level regularly. (The location for installing the gauge should be near a telephone, and if one has already been set up, it can be omitted.) (5) The personnel recording the water level should also report the water level fluctuations at any time, first by telephone to the committee member of this department, who will transmit it to the committee members of neighboring counties, and also report to the county government, and then fill out a form to submit to the county government for record. (6) The recording time is three times a day, at 7:00 am, 12:00 pm, and 5:00 pm, but in special circumstances, it must be recorded at any time. (7) The committee member's residence should be near the water gauge location or the district office. (8) The committee member must report the water level fluctuations, fill in the form, and report to the department every three days.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Charcoal-Powered Vehicle Engine Factory Established in Hankou <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Since the advent of automobiles, China has not been able to manufacture them ourselves, and the sales of gasoline have been enormous, resulting in an astonishing outflow of funds every year. Since the opening of highways in various provinces, the loss is even greater where public buses operate.</p>
<p>Tang Zhongming's charcoal-powered vehicle engine to replace gasoline engines has long been publicized. Mr. Tang studied in France for many years and devoted himself to the automotive industry. After returning to China, he researched and manufactured charcoal-powered vehicle engines for five years, using charcoal instead of gasoline. First, the fuel is very cheap and readily available everywhere; second, driving can be entirely supplied by domestic products, which will greatly benefit the national economy. Trial results in various provinces of Henan, Shanxi, and the capital have been deemed stable and applicable. All newspapers have reported on this. It is understood that the charcoal-powered vehicle engine was originally invented by the French, but the research was not perfect and was declared a failure. The machines made by the French could not travel long distances, were slower than gasoline, could not climb steep slopes, and were bulky. The machines manufactured by Mr. Tang can avoid the above disadvantages, so everyone is generally satisfied. Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi-Suiyuan, and Xiong Shihui, the chairman of Jiangxi Province, heard that this charcoal-powered engine was beneficial to the people's livelihood and invited him to set up factories in their respective provinces, but it did not materialize due to various reasons. Recently, Mr. Li Hesheng of Hankou invited Mr. Tang to cooperate, hired him as the chief engineer, and established a factory to manufacture them themselves, named the China Coal Gas Engine Manufacturing Factory, located on Shenchang Street. This reporter was invited to visit. The factory occupies a large area, and after a short period of operation, the scale is roughly complete. Goods have already been shipped to Shaanxi, Henan, and Sichuan provinces. The Beijing and Hankou municipal governments have also purchased and applied them. Even the American Dodge Motor Company has purchased many units and installed them on new cars to attract customers.</p>
<p>The factory's output currently cannot meet demand. After the equipment is expanded, it is being added one after another. If the equipment is expanded, the daily output will be more than 100 engines. According to the factory, this charcoal engine is most suitable for long-distance buses because the charcoal material is most abundant in the interior. After starting, there is no short-distance stop. As for the form of the engine body, the initial model was very large and lacked beauty. It has now been improved to create a refined style. Those installed on ordinary vehicles are covered with boxes to hide them, without revealing their shape, and do not damage the original appearance.</p>
<p>The factory provides on-site installation for local customers who purchase the engine and ships them in boxes to distant customers, sending personnel to handle them and provide instructions on how to use them. A training class has now been established in the factory to recruit junior and senior high school graduates, provide them with practical training and lectures, and graduate them in the shortest time. In the future, they will be sent to various places to serve. The factory has obtained patent rights from the Ministry of Industry. Mr. Li is now paying attention to the northwestern provinces, and in the future, he plans to promote it in the southeastern provinces. There are currently more than 300 workers in the factory, and the treatment is quite comprehensive. In addition to the training class, accommodation is also provided. The factory and dormitory are clean. A large-scale dormitory is being renovated, which can accommodate at least several hundred people. The factory has a wide area, fine grass like a carpet, green shade everywhere, and fresh air. If it can maintain its reputation and strive for perfection in the future, it will not be difficult to expand its scope.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Peiping: After Huo Weizhou, a committee member of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, was assassinated, his coffin was placed in Fayuan Temple. Northeast dignitaries Bao Yulin, Wang Huayi, Wang Zhuoran, and others, remembering Huo's sacrifice for the country, held a memorial service at Fayuan Temple yesterday (the 25th). More than 300 people from all walks of life attended the memorial service. Wang Zhuoran presided over the meeting, and Gao Chongmin reported on Huo's life and deeds. Details are recorded below:</p>

<p>The funeral hall was set up in the east wing of the rear of Fayuan Temple. A portrait of Huo was hung in the center. Three plain colored arches were erected in front of the hall, adorned with the words "Sacrificed for the Country." More than 220 elegiac couplets and more than 40 floral wreaths were hung inside and outside the courtyard and the funeral hall. In addition, Zhu Qinglan sent a horizontal plaque inscribed with "Eternal Ambition." Huo's family members were all behind the funeral hall, covered in white cloth, and the tragic cries were endless, which was particularly heartbreaking. Guests were divided between the southwest and northwest wings. Inside and outside the temple, Yuan Hualun, the director of the Fourth District Police Department, led patrol officers to maintain order.</p>

<p>Huo was extremely honest and had no savings. This sudden assassination left his family in dire straits. In addition to the 1,000 yuan allocated by Zhu Qinglan, the funeral expenses were borne by Huo's relatives and friends. The coffin will be temporarily placed in Fayuan Temple, and after the lost territories of the East Province are recovered, it will be moved to Huo's original burial place in Kaiyuan County, Liaoning. Currently, the living problems are being actively addressed by relatives and friends. Huo's daughter, Wenying, is sixteen years old and will be chosen by relatives and friends to marry. Huo's eldest son is planned to be sent to a school to study, and the remaining three sons are still young and will be raised to adulthood to carry on their father's legacy.</p>

<p>"On the twenty-fifth day of June in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhuoran and others respectfully offer clear wine and sacrifices to the spirit of Mr. Huo, saying: Alas, Mr. Huo, with innate brilliance and outstanding talent, you quickly gained fame. At a young age, you carried your books to the gates of Yan, delved into scholarship, and achieved profound attainments. After completing your studies, you taught in your hometown, patiently guiding and tirelessly speaking. The fate of the nation was at its lowest, the political program collapsed, and powerful neighbors surrounded us, recklessly invading. You were deeply concerned about the state of affairs and were determined to save the country and turn weakness into strength. You put your words into action, stood firm in your ambition, mobilized the people, and united them. During the Shenyang Incident, you rushed to the old capital to participate in the resistance against Japan and seek recovery. For two years, you were spirited and energetic, not avoiding difficulties and dangers, and exhausting your wisdom. You hoped that your talents could be used to drive out the Japanese invaders and express the pain of the lost province. But on a thoroughfare, a sudden and violent assailant came, and you died with your ambition. Alas, how painful! I think of your demeanor, generous and tolerant, shining like the sun and moon, and gentle like the spring breeze. You were intelligent and sharp, with extraordinary courage, firm in your beliefs, and distinguished from the crowd. You deeply despised peace and contention, abandoning profit and embracing righteousness. Everyone wanted to seize power, but you only made clear your ambition. Heaven did not pity us and took away our wise man. Our homeland is lost, and the building is about to collapse. Your great ambition was not realized, and your coffin is a thousand miles away. Your wife is a widow, and your children are young, weeping with tears. Alas, Weizhou, your form has passed, but your spirit remains. You lived as a righteous man and died as a hero. We, your friends, grieve for you with deep sorrow. We are eternally separated by life and death, and our sadness is endless. We set up sacrifices and pour a glass of wine. May your soul be present and enjoy our offerings. Alas, woe!"</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Main Culprit is Arrested <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After Huo Weizhou was assassinated and killed in Peiping, the Second District Police Department successively arrested more than ten people, including Yang Chongren, the principal of Min Tuo Middle School, at the Litong Hotel in Dongjiaomin Lane, and took them to the Second District Police Department for interrogation. After separate investigations by Yin Huanran, the head of the district police department, Yang and others initially admitted that they were members of the National Socialist Party and that Min Tuo Middle School was the operating agency of the National Socialist Party in Peiping, but they did not admit that they were involved in the assassination of Huo. Later, after the police department presented witnesses Shao (Yang's friend) and Wang Wentao, also known as Wang Zizhen (a female teacher at the school), as evidence, Yang admitted that Huo Weizhou was an important member of the National Socialist Party, but now he had betrayed the party, which had a major impact on the party, so he was ordered by the party to kill Huo, and he sent someone to assassinate him. Since there is a main culprit in this case, it is not necessary to pursue who the murderer is. The other suspects also gave the same confession as Yang, and they were all silent about the murderer. Therefore, the district police department hired three cars on the night of the 23rd and sent more than ten suspects in the case to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It was also learned that Yang had made considerable arrangements before sending someone to kill Huo, planning to flee to the Litong Hotel in Dongjiaomin Lane immediately after the assassination, and then be introduced by the wife of his friend Shao (who is French) to another French person, who would ensure his escape from Peiping. However, when Shao designed to hide him in the Litong Hotel after Huo was assassinated and Yang came to the hotel to meet him, he went to the Second District Police Department to inform on him. The police department dispatched plainclothes detectives to arrest Yang and the other suspects. The shocking case was finally solved. According to reliable sources this morning (the 26th), Shao in the Huo case is not his real name. He once studied diplomacy in France and once served as the secretary of the deputy commander-in-chief before Zhang Liang went abroad. His wife is quite famous in the social circles of Peiping and has frequent contact with ministers of various countries. He has been living in a certain place in the east of the city and has now been released on bail, it is said. (26th)</p>

<p>Record of Robbery Cases</p>
<p>Cai Dunxiang of Xihutang Township, Punan, is a modestly wealthy family who has accumulated some savings over the years. On the evening of the 24th of this month, a number of bandits suddenly came and dragged the victim and his mother and three daughters from their beds, tied them up, stuffed their mouths with cotton, and prevented them from making noise. Because the victim's mother was still struggling, she was beaten by the bandits. As a result, all the jewelry was robbed, and rumors have it that more than 1,000 yuan in silver dollars was also robbed and they escaped. On the evening of the 27th, the Shi family, a clan gathering in the middle of the East Market of the Zhongdu Bridge in the second district of the city, was coveted by bandits because the Shi Xiaodi family was relatively wealthy. Bandits speaking a mixture of local and Hakka dialects broke into the house and ransacked it before escaping.</p>

<p>The case of Chen Jifang, the twelve-year-old daughter of Chen Shuang, the owner of the Gongmao dyeing shop in Taoxingqiao, being lured and raped by an apprentice the night before yesterday has been heard by the Procuratorate, which has dispatched police to investigate thoroughly. The victim is scheduled to be summoned for interrogation on the 30th. However, the victim was severely injured at the time. Although she was sent to Deqiong Hospital for treatment, she is still unable to sit up. It is uncertain whether she will be able to appear in court at that time. According to reports, the runaway apprentice, Liu Gouzi, is from Nanjing and is eighteen years old. On that day, Jifang was a guest at her sister's house, which was located near her residence. Liu happened to visit. At that time, except for the children who were left at home for Jifang to take care of, all the other family members had gone shopping on the street. Liu Gouzi suddenly had a surge of bestial desire and took the opportunity to rape her. When he saw her injured and bleeding, he fled. When her sister returned home from shopping and saw Jifang lying stiff on the bed, she was shocked and ran to tell her father. After inquiring about the details, she was carried to Deqiong Hospital for treatment. The young girl's emotions were not yet developed, and she was trampled upon at will. The apprentice's evil is truly unforgivable.</p>

<p>Despicable Police Officer Injures a Weak Woman</p>
<p>Wu Laosan, a 24-year-old woman from Yaojiaqiao, is somewhat attractive. Last year, she was seduced by Zhang Xiufeng, a police officer of the 21st Squad of the 5th Maritime Police District stationed in Yaojiaqiao, Yutang, and committed adultery with him. The woman went to Shanghai to work in the twelfth lunar month of that year, and Zhang married another woman. In March of this year, the woman returned to Zhenjiang, and Zhang wanted to rekindle their old relationship, but the woman repeatedly refused. Zhang became angry and intended to retaliate, using the Zhao robbery case in Dagang as an excuse to falsely accuse the woman of being involved in the case. Taking advantage of her return to her hometown at the end of April, he lured her to the district headquarters and detained her for four days. He also ordered her to sign a guarantee and ordered her to assist in the investigation. The woman encountered Zhang on the road in Yao on the evening of the day before yesterday, and he suddenly came up with a vicious plan. He tricked her into going to the New Inn and forced her to hand over her expenses, but was unsuccessful. He then took her to the Self-Defense Corps, poured kerosene into her nose, and subjected her to inhumane torture, causing her to lose consciousness and suffer serious injuries. Later, she was transferred to the Zhenjiang Fifth Maritime District Office, where District Chief Zhao recognized the injustice and immediately released her. Zhang's anger did not subside, and he tied the woman's mother to a tree, whipped her, and stole a gold ring. He even forced her to throw herself into the river. It is now heard that the woman has come to Zhenjiang to sue the court and has also applied to the court for an examination of her injuries and for Zhang to be arrested and punished.</p>

<h3 id="e120">The Yangtze River Shipping Industry is Declining <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Various Companies Suspend Services and Reduce Sailings</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, business in the Yangtze River shipping industry has been increasingly sluggish. Recently, since the Yangtze River has been in flood, both upstream and downstream imports and exports have been in short supply, resulting in fewer goods and more ships, and an excess of tonnage. In order to maintain long-term operations, various shipping companies in this port have proposed reducing services and tightening operations. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Failure to Maintain Freight Rates <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the Yangtze River route is operated by Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, Sanbei, NingShao, Jiejiang, Xiangtai, Nisshin, Minsheng, and other shipping companies. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, and Sanbei all have regular scheduled services, but there are also many unscheduled "wild chicken" services. Recently, the major companies, in view of the excessive competition and price cutting of Yangtze River freight, which has caused significant losses in revenue, agreed that downstream goods should be charged at a fixed rate with a double nine discount plus a 1.95 commission, and no further price drops would be allowed. This measure was tried for two weeks, but it failed. Customers in Hankou did not ship large quantities of goods.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Sharp Decline in Imports and Exports <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The shortage of goods on Yangtze River ships this year is rare in recent years. The main reason is that the people's purchasing power is weak, resulting in a sharp drop in goods going from Shanghai, which is only about two-sevenths of what it was before the January 28th Incident. The situation is the same for both incoming and outgoing goods, and the same is true for Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, Sanbei, NingShao, and other ships. In normal times, Taikoo and Jardine Matheson could receive up to 10,000 yuan in freight for each Yangtze River ship when there were many goods for export, and at least 15,000 to 16,000 yuan for a round trip. But now, the freight income for a single voyage is less than 5,000 yuan, while the expenses, including fuel, are at least 6,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e123">No Remedial Measures Yet <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Various shipping companies have suffered huge losses in business on the Yangtze River route and cannot reduce the expenses of each ship. Therefore, the major companies held a special meeting last Saturday to discuss remedial measures. They concluded that the people were impoverished, finances were exhausted, and there was a shortage of cargo transportation, so there was really no way to remedy the business. As a result, no measures were agreed upon.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Suspension of Services and Reduction of Sailings Implemented <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the four companies of Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, and Sanbei have more than 40 Yangtze River ships, plus Nisshin, Xiangtai, Jiejiang, and others, resulting in an excess of tonnage. In order to reduce losses, each company has formulated passive maintenance methods and is implementing the suspension of services for Yangtze River ships that are older and consume more fuel. All companies will implement this uniformly, and Jardine Matheson has decided to suspend the operation of the Lianhe service starting from July 3.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Bankers Association Held its Annual Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Li Fuxun Reported on the Association's Activities</p>
<p>The Bankers Association held its fourth annual meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday at the Association’s auditorium, No. 4 Hong Kong Road.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, National Industrial Bank of China, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Chung Fu Bank, Sze Ming Commercial Bank, China Banking Corporation, Guangdong Provincial Bank, Kin Cheng Banking Corporation, The New China Trust and Savings Bank, Tung Lai Bank, The Continental Bank, The Bank of East Asia, Wing Hang Bank, The Chinese Guanye Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Bank of Communications of Southern China, Overseas Chinese Bank, Jiangsu Bank, The China State Bank, Ken Yieh Bank, Chung Hing Bank, The Farmers Bank of China, The National Goods Bank, Tung Woo Bank, National Commercial Bank, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and other banks, including Xu Ji, Qian Xin-zhi, Xu Xin-liu, and Li Fuxun, a total of sixty-seven people attended. Secretary-General Lin Kanghou was also present.</p>
<p>The Chairman reported that the total number of bank representatives was one hundred and twenty-eight, of which sixty-seven were present, sufficient to meet the legal quorum. He then rang the bell to commence the meeting. Chairman Li Fuxun reported on the association's activities, stating that the association was about to enter its second year since its establishment. Important matters handled in the past had been reported at each general membership meeting. Now that the fourth general meeting was at hand, he had reviewed the case files from the past half-year and selected several important matters that could be reported to all members. He presented a summary for consideration by the members. (1) Abolishing the Tael and Adopting the Yuan: The most significant matter for the financial community this year was the abolition of the tael and adoption of the yuan. The motivation to promote the abolition of the tael in the banking industry dates back more than a decade. It had been brewed over repeatedly but was difficult to achieve. This year, the government resolved to reform the currency system and announced a fixed conversion rate between silver dollars and taels in February. Shortly thereafter, the Ministry of Finance resolutely ordered the implementation of the abolition of the tael on April 5. The association immediately convened an emergency joint meeting of silver and money industries that evening. In order to assist the government in promoting good governance, the banks and money shops were the first to unanimously comply. However, in haste, there were many complex details that needed to be planned perfectly to avoid obstacles. Therefore, meetings were held day and night, and telegrams and letters were exchanged frequently. A forward bill registration office was established within a short period of time. After a period of ten days, things gradually progressed. Other industries and foreign banks that were still waiting and watching also successively implemented the policy. The historical anomalous currency system was thus eliminated in one fell swoop, which was not only a fortunate event for the financial community but also a successful initial step for the future of monetary policy. (2) Petitioning the Ministry of Finance to Formulate Regulations for Minting Decimal Silver Subsidiary Coins: After the implementation of the abolition of the tael, unifying silver subsidiary coins was also an urgent task. China's currency system has always been complex and indescribable. Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, is especially full of light silver coins and copper coins. They are difficult to use and have a significant impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people. The Ministry of Finance, aware of this, solicited the opinions of the association. After research by a subcommittee, both palliative and fundamental solutions were drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Finance, instructing customs offices to strictly prohibit imports while also expediting the formulation of decimal silver subsidiary coin minting regulations to promote the unification of the currency system. The Ministry of Finance is currently coordinating and organizing the matter, and implementation is expected soon. (3) Establishment of a Rural Financial Adjustment Committee: Rural areas have been declining year by year, which is enough to shake the foundations of the country. In May of this year, the Executive Yuan organized the Rural Reconstruction Committee to seek ways to provide relief. At the same time, it sent a letter to the association, ordering it to organize a Rural Financial Adjustment Committee to assist in the effort. The association nominated twenty-one people, including Zhang Gongquan, to form the committee. However, due to the importance of the matter, empty words were insufficient. A definitive plan was necessary, and the government needed to make substantial efforts to advocate for rural relief. Therefore, the committee is currently still under consultation. (4) Pledging Donations for Airplanes and Relief for Northeastern Refugees: In March of this year, when the Rehe War was in crisis, people across the country felt deep sorrow and indignation. For a time, there was a surge in contributions to support the army. The association, not wanting to be left behind in patriotism, also launched a salary donation campaign among its employees, hoping to provide a small contribution to the military. However, the war situation was unfavorable, and the morale of the people declined as a result, and the matter was interrupted. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sought donations for airplanes, and Zhu Ziqiao and Xiong Jiansan, seeing the plight of the displaced Northeastern refugees, also went out to raise funds. The association believed that the airplane donation was related to national defense, and it could not bear to stand idly by while the refugees were suffering. Therefore, the executive committee decided to have each bank pledge donations based on the previously reported salary donation amounts from their employees. A total of more than 45,800 yuan was raised. In May, the funds were distributed, with 10,000 yuan for the purchase of airplanes by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, 15,000 yuan for the purchase of airplanes by the Municipal Government, and more than 20,800 yuan to Zhu Ziqiao and Xiong Bing-san for relief for Northeastern refugees. Official receipts were obtained for each transaction. This was the duty of each bank to the country and society, and the association was only acting as an agent to facilitate the matter.

<h3 id="e126">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Promotes Chinese Insurance <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>And Requests Setting Limits on Foreign Merchant Notaries</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Fourth Representative Assembly resolved to petition the Ministry of Industry to set limits on the ability of foreign merchants to act as notaries. At the same time, it notified all members not to purchase fire insurance from foreign merchant companies. The petition and notification are detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Petition to the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the petition: The Chamber convened its Fourth Representative Assembly on the 25th of this month to discuss the proposal put forward by Executive Committee Member Ma Shaoquan and others, stating, "It has been found that the fire insurance industry originated with the British and then spread to Europe and the United States. It has been practiced in our country for several decades. Its main purpose is to prepare for the unexpected and ensure safety, which is an excellent principle. However, in the event of a claim, disputes often arise between the insurer and the insured regarding compensation. In order to find a fair and impartial way to resolve these disputes, it is necessary to involve a third party to mediate. This third party is the fire insurance notary. Therefore, the notary's position embodies the nature of arbitration and exercises the function of appraisal, which is extremely important to the interests of both parties and their legal standing. In European and American countries, those engaged in the business of notary public must first register with the government and obtain permission before they can practice. However, foreign merchant notaries are now established throughout our country. They have not registered with our government or obtained permission from the local authorities. They are established freely and without any restrictions. This not only violates international practice but also infringes upon our legal rights. At a time when political tutelage is just beginning and legal rights are being sought to be recovered, our government is gradually restricting foreign lawyers, accountants, and others, but it allows these notaries to encroach upon our rights. They exercise their power throughout the country. Regardless of whether their arguments are fair or not, they disgrace our national prestige more than anything else. This is still the infringement of rights by foreign merchant insurance companies entrusting foreign merchant notaries. Recently, when Chinese insurance companies encounter claims, they also hire foreign merchant notaries to handle the assessment. The insurance company is established by Chinese, and the insured are also Chinese. Yet, foreigners are used as notaries to make assessments, which is even more absurd. Moreover, foreign merchant notaries use foreign languages with incomprehensible wording, deliberately distorting the facts. Even if there are disputes, they often dismiss them on the grounds that they are not valid. There are still cases that have been pending for several years, further proving the deep pain suffered by the Chinese people. The various chambers of commerce in the ports have appealed for assistance because of the oppression of foreign merchant notaries. Therefore, we hereby present the following remedies: (1) Notify all trade associations and inform the chambers of commerce in various places to inform their respective members that they should promote Chinese insurance businesses in the future. If a foreign merchant notary is used by the insurance company when a claim occurs, it should be rejected. (2) Send a special letter to the Shanghai Chinese Insurance Association, asking it to instruct its member companies not to use foreign merchant notaries again in order to uphold national prestige. (3) Petition the government to strictly crack down on foreign merchant notaries abusing the powers of a notary public and request that a public decision be made." The motion was passed. The first item was notified to all trades for compliance, and the second and third items were submitted separately for review and approval. Limiting foreign merchant notaries from exercising their powers requires the government to clearly define laws and regulations, implement registration procedures, and establish the principle that Chinese merchants should serve as notaries. It is difficult to reverse the accumulated trend. The association, based on the resolutions of the Second General Assembly in the 20th year of the Republic of China, petitioned for review and approval but did not receive a response. Now, based on the foregoing, we hereby re-submit the case and petition Your Ministry to review, approve, and promptly define measures and notify all subordinates to comply with them, which would be for the public good.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Notice to All Trades <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, on the 25th of this month, the Chamber convened its Fourth Representative Assembly to discuss the proposal of Supervisor Fang Jiaobo, which stated, in brief, "The insurance industry is of great importance to the national economy and the interests of the insured. Please submit to the General Assembly for a resolution to notify all trades and commercial organizations to inform their respective members that all group or private property that is to be insured should be insured with Chinese insurance companies. This will not only prevent the leakage of money but also avoid the dangers when a claim occurs. Is this appropriate? Please vote on it." The motion was passed, and all trade associations were notified to comply with it. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby notify you. Please inform your fellow merchants to comply. Otherwise, if disputes arise in the future due to insurance with foreign merchant companies and assistance is requested, it should not be accepted. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Qingdao Naval Mutiny: Five Warships Sailed to Miao Island, According to Sources <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>News obtained from the local naval side.</p>
<p>The Downfall of Shen is a Struggle between the Hubei and Jiangsu-Zhejiang Factions</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, a mutiny broke out in the Qingdao Navy to overthrow Shen Honglie. The cruisers Haiqi and Haichen and the training cruiser Zhaoh and other five warships defied orders after the execution of Feng Zhizhong, the assassin of Shen Honglie, and sailed away from Qingdao on their own initiative, making clear demands. Details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, the reporter inquired with the local navy for the following information:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Sailing to Miao Island <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to sources, the cruisers Haiqi and Haichen, the training cruiser Zhaoh and the gunboats Zhenhai and Chuyu from the Qingdao Navy have sailed away from Qingdao and are currently at Miao Island (outside the port of Penglai County). However, Miao Island is barren. The reason for sailing there is unknown. Although it is said that the captains of the five warships have landed, it seems that the initiative was taken by lower-ranking officers. It is unlikely that the entire group landed. There must be one or two captains involved in the joint action. If this was an action by soldiers, then the warships could not have sailed if even the lower-ranking officers had landed.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Factional Strife <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>As for the Qingdao Navy, it broke away from the Northeast Fleet. Recently, there have been relatively few people from Fujian and Guangdong, and those from Shandong have also been eliminated. Most are from the Hubei and Jiangsu-Zhejiang factions. Although Commander Shen Honglie and Chief of Staff and Captain of the Haiqi, Ling Xiao, were both sent to Japan for study by the Qing-era Hubei Navy, Shen is from Hubei, and Ling is from Jiangsu. Moreover, Ling's Haiqi participated in the movement to overthrow Shen. Therefore, it is generally believed that this turmoil is a struggle between the Hubei and Jiangsu-Zhejiang factions.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Never Surrender to the Puppet Regime <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Now that the five warships have gone to Miao Island, it is predicted that they will be stationed there temporarily, waiting for mediators. Talk of surrendering to the puppet regime is an overreaction. Most of the officers are from Hubei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. It would be even more difficult to go to Guangdong because the central navy is blocking the way, and there is a shortage of coal and water. It is difficult to travel long distances without stopping.</p>
<h3 id="e133">A Glimpse of Reality <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>All the warships of the Qingdao Navy are the cruisers Haiqi and Haichen, the training cruiser Zhaoh, the gunboats Chuyu, Zhenhai, Dinghai, Jiangli, Tong'an, and Weihai, a total of nine ships. The Haiqi, Haichen, Zhaoh, and Chuyu are relatively strong. The Zhenhai and Dinghai were converted from merchant ships and are now larger. Apart from the Zhenhai mutiny, the other ships have no strength at all. The table below shows their actual strength.</p>
<p>(Ship) (Displacement) (Guns) (Speed)</p>
<p>Haiqi Cruiser 4300 24 24</p>
<p>Haichen Cruiser 2950 20 19.5</p>
<p>Zhenhai Cruiser 300 12 14</p>
<p>Weihai Cruiser 1900 14 14</p>
<p>Dinghai Torpedo Mother Ship 700 10 19</p>
<p>Zhaoh Cruiser 2600 24 23</p>
<p>Chuyu Gunboat 740 12 14</p>

<p>600,000 Yuan has been Allocated for Flood Control</p>
<p>The Turmoil in the Northeast Fleet will not Escalate</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to handle the enrollment of the Sino-French School. He is scheduled to take the night train back to Nanjing tonight. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chu yesterday morning and inquired about various issues such as water control work and the turmoil in the Northeast Fleet. Chu provided detailed answers as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Central Government Pays Attention to Flood Prevention Work <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to Chu, the Central Government attaches great importance to flood prevention work and has instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate 600,000 yuan for flood prevention, which is needed for protecting long dikes and other projects. The Yangtze River Waterways Board is the central agency for flood prevention. The chairman of the board, Zhou Xiangxian, has already flown to Jiujiang and will be stationed in Xunyang to oversee flood prevention work both upstream and downstream. The Executive Yuan has also instructed the authorities in various provinces to strictly prevent floods. In addition to the provinces raising funds on their own, the Central Government will provide appropriate subsidies. August is the season with the highest water levels each year. The river water in June this year has been particularly high, exceeding the water level in mid-June of the 20th year of the Republic of China by several feet. If the dredging is smooth, the river water is expected to rise again in mid-August, but it is hoped that it will not cause a disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Turmoil in the Northeast Fleet <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Mayor of Qingdao and Commander of the Northeast Fleet, Shen Honglie, was assassinated and frightened. The Central Government sent a telegram to express its condolences. The five warships Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaoh left Qingdao because they opposed Shen. It was purely a personal matter. The rumors that they would defect to the puppet regime are not accurate. The Central Government has not yet received a detailed report on the turmoil, nor has it received Shen's resignation. The newspaper reports that Shen has telegraphed the Central Government to resign from all his positions are not accurate. The Central Government must wait until it receives a detailed report before handling the matter. It is hoped that the situation will not escalate.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Shi Ying's Trip to Hong Kong was Successful <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Shi Ying and Duan Xipeng went to Hong Kong to represent President Wang and explain all misunderstandings. Both Shi and Duan returned to Nanjing the day before yesterday to report, and the results were satisfactory. Chen Mingshu, who recently returned from overseas, is expected to go to Nanjing soon. Telegrams from Hong Kong stated that the Central Government will appoint Chen Mingshu to govern Guangdong. The rumors that Shi and Duan went to Hong Kong to solicit opinions are purely rumors spread by politicians to sow discord and are not accurate. The date of Minister Huang's return to the north has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Chahar Situation is Expected to be Resolved Peacefully <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Chahar issue has recently changed again, and the reasons are quite complicated. The Central Government has still entrusted the North China authorities to handle the Chahar situation, which is expected to be resolved peacefully. Sun Dianying has been appointed as the Director of Reclamation and Settlement in the Western District of Qinghai, and the order has already been issued. Sun did not ask for a single penny for travel expenses, which is commendable. We sincerely hope that Sun's troops will go west as soon as possible, devote themselves to reclamation and settlement, and then return to Chahar to resume their duties. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Central Bank, must wait until the Chahar situation is resolved before returning to Chahar to resume his duties. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Central Bank, will travel north within a few days. Kong's trip will be beneficial to the Chahar situation. However, Kong has been busy reviewing the new currency of the Central Mint, which is scheduled to be issued on July 1, which has caused the delay.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Dangerous Period of the Yangtze River Flood Season Has Passed <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Water Levels are Receding Rapidly Upstream</p>
<p>The Dikes are Stable and Will Not Cause a Disaster</p>
<p>Xi Detong, the Chief Engineer of the Engineering Department of the National Economic Council, has sent repeated letters and telegrams to Hankou to report on the critical situation of the main dikes in Wuhan. Yesterday, he sent a more detailed letter to the Engineering Department of the local Economic Council. The gist of the letter is as follows: (Omitted title) The Yangtze River has been rising in recent days, and the water level in Hankou has reached 47.2 feet. However, the dikes along the river built by the Hubei Provincial Flood Committee (which were taken over and reinforced by the National Economic Council this year) have not been damaged. During the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the old dikes on both sides of the Yangtze and Han rivers collapsed when the water was 45 feet high. Now, the water level is two feet and two inches higher than in the previous year, and the dikes are still intact, which is enough to prove that the dikes built last year are solid. All necessary flood control work is being handled by the Jianghan Engineering Department of the council. The recruitment of laborers in case of emergency has been properly negotiated and regulated with the provincial government and local authorities. All materials for engineering applications have also been prepared in advance and transported to appropriate locations for use in case of dike emergencies. The dangerous period has now passed. Hankou has had several days of sunny weather last week, and the water level has been 47.2 feet. The height of the upstream stations has also been dropping repeatedly, indicating that the river water has stabilized and will not continue to surge. (Omitted remaining text) On the 27th, the Naval Mail stated that the Yangtze River flood has subsided by thirty feet in Jiachang, twelve feet in Jiujiang, seven feet in Shashi, five feet in Changsha, and gradually in Yuezhou. The water level today is forty-seven feet and two inches. The water level on the riverbank is compared with the third year of Qing Xuantong (1911), when the water level was three feet. The river was not flooded that year, and the current situation of the river is very similar. The dikes are still intact. If the weather does not become rainy again, it can be hoped that there will be no floods. In addition, according to the head of the General Affairs Department of the association. The National Economic Council has allocated 200,000 yuan to prevent river dikes in Hubei Province. The flood season in August is approaching. The association has sent additional workers to work, and engineers have also been transferred to the Yangtze River to provide flood protection. To prevent the Huai River, the association has also,</p>

<p>A Basic Understanding Will Lead to a General Solution</p>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Fei Xin Dun, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday and inquired about the truth of the negotiations on the factory inspection case in the concession. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Negotiation Process <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>According to Director-General Fei, the two meetings with Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, were informal consultations. Each party presented their measures for discussion. The Municipal Government's measures have been consulted with the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing for their opinions. It is said that there are still several points that need to be discussed and revised by the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>Duolun and Other Places are About to be Recovered</p>
<p>Chu Huiseng and other Standing Committee members of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from Fang Zhenwu yesterday, which read, "Huiseng, my brother, and all the honorable Standing Committee members, I haven't seen you for a long time and I am thinking of you dearly. I am grateful for your hard work in managing the association. I admire your efforts very much. I am leading troops on the frontier, vowing to fight the Japanese bandits. The lost territories of Duolun and other places in Chahar are expected to be recovered soon. I know you are concerned, so I am reporting this to you. Huang Shouzhong, the commander of the First Army of the Rehe Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, currently has about 8,000 men under his command. Together with Zhou Han's troops, there are more than 9,000 men in total. They have been fighting the Japanese in Rehe and other places for several months, suffering many casualties. They have repeatedly captured key Japanese leaders and have achieved considerable success in combat. They are now concentrated on the border between Chahar and Rehe, undergoing reorganization. I sincerely hope that all parties will make every effort to assist them so that they can continue to kill the enemy and restore our northern territory. I am appealing on their behalf. I hope that your esteemed association will generously provide financial assistance to facilitate their efforts. I am deeply grateful. I am sending this letter respectfully and wish you good health. Yours sincerely, Fang Zhenwu."</p>

<p>Jiang Kanghu previously traveled around the world and was warmly welcomed by various friendly nations. Later, he was hired by the British government as the Dean of the University College in Montreal, Canada, McGill University Montreal Canada, with a lifetime contract. He has been in office for more than three years. Since the September 18th and January 28th incidents occurred one after another, Jiang, who was far away in a foreign land, felt the seriousness of the national crisis. He has repeatedly expressed his opinions, filled with sorrow and indignation, and has repeatedly wanted to resign and return to China to share the national crisis. Last year, he sent a letter to his friends in Shanghai, saying, "Kanghu is far away in a foreign land, and he is grieved to hear of the bad news. He regrets that he cannot join his comrades in hell." However, although Jiang's intention to resign was firm, he could not get the approval of the government because of his contractual relationship. After several negotiations, he was granted a year's leave. Jiang sent a letter to his friends in Shanghai yesterday, saying that he could not rest because of the national crisis and had repeatedly thought about returning to China. He has now been granted leave and will depart from Canada immediately, traveling through Washington, New York, Chicago, and other places, where he has been invited to give lectures. He will be able to buy a boat and sail from San Francisco on June 30, taking the Grant President of the Dollar Steamship Lines back to China. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 21.</p>

<p>Su Bingwen Went to Hangzhou from Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>Zhang Met Ma at 9 AM Before Heading North</p>
<p>Generals Ma Zhan and Su Bingwen have completed their trip to Jiangxi to meet Chiang Kai-shek. They returned to Shanghai on the same riverboat. They arrived in Nanjing at around 9:00 AM yesterday and disembarked. Except for General Su, who was slightly unwell, disembarked and took the special Shanghai-Nanjing express train to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou at 10:00 AM. General Ma visited Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, for a while before returning to Shanghai on the same riverboat. He is expected to arrive this morning.</p>

<p>After arriving in Nanjing, General Su Bingwen transferred to the special Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou train at 10:00 AM, accompanied by Lang Guanpu, the former Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and others, to Shanghai. Lang and the others got off at the North Station, while General Su transferred to Hangzhou and arrived there at 9:46 PM last night to recuperate. It is said that Su's son and others also went to Hangzhou with him.</p>

<p>According to Lang Guanpu, who returned to Shanghai from Jiangxi on the same boat as General Ma and others, Generals Ma and Su met Chiang Kai-shek three times in Nanchang. The first time, Commander Chiang was in Lushan and met with Generals Ma and Su. Later, because he was busy with the bandit suppression work, Generals Ma and Su went to Nanchang to meet with him. They talked for about an hour. Then, Chiang learned that Generals Ma and Su had fought the Japanese in the Northeast and had traveled to Europe and back to China, and they had worked hard. He ordered them to go to Lushan for temporary rest and to meet again in Lushan when he had time. Later, Chiang went to Fuzhou to speak to the troops and was busy with the bandit suppression work, so he had no time to spare. Therefore, the second and third times, Generals Ma and Su also went to Nanchang to meet with him. Now, Generals Ma and Su are returning to Shanghai. General Su has passed through Shanghai to Hangzhou. General Ma is still taking the riverboat because it is more comfortable. He will arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Yang Yongtai Discusses the Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The bandit forces in Jiangxi are collapsing, and the National Army is in pursuit.</p>
<p>The bandit areas that have already been recovered will be vigorously relieved.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that Mr. Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces, recently arrived in Nanjing from Jiangxi and met with Premier Wang to report on the recent situation of bandit suppression. Mr. Yang then arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning around 8 a.m. due to official business. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed him at his residence, inquiring about the current state of bandit suppression under Chairman Chiang. According to his account:</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Victory to Pursue and Suppress: The bandit trouble in Jiangxi Province persists. Because the bandits stubbornly resist from fortified positions, the suppression campaign has not yet been completely cleared, causing extremely tragic harm to the local area. Since Chairman Chiang stationed troops in Jiangxi to carry out suppression, he has issued orders to all armies to vigorously pursue and encircle, setting a time limit for clearing them out. Unexpectedly, the bandits instead besieged Yihuang. Chairman Chiang, in order to encourage the frontline soldiers, recently went to the front line to inspect the area, greatly boosting the morale of the army. The bandits besieging Yihuang have already collapsed and scattered in all directions towards bandit nests such as Le'an. The besieging army has taken advantage of the victory to advance and suppress, aiming to directly attack the bandit nests and resolve the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>Time Limit for Clearing Out Red Bandits in Jiangxi Province: According to the latest investigation, although it is difficult to obtain an accurate number, there are likely around 70,000 firearms. The National Army for bandit suppression numbers over 200,000. He Jian in the west, Chen Jitang in the south, and Liu Zhenhua, etc., will jointly encircle and suppress. Therefore, within three months, although it may not be possible to completely eliminate the Jiangxi bandits, it will certainly not be difficult to destroy their main forces. The National Army for bandit suppression does not have exclusive authority over bandit suppression; expenses are allocated according to the original military budget. Rumors of raising bandit suppression public bonds are not true, he said.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Bandit Suppression: Bandit suppression work is extremely difficult, because there are often good and innocent people implicated among the bandits. While suppressing the bandits, the Central Army must also appease the good people. This kind of war can be called a war for the people. It is necessary to make the masses repent and awaken. Therefore, the suppression also involves persuasion work, which is more difficult than any other war.</p>
<p>Responsible for Relief: As for the bandit areas that have already been recovered, the central and local governments are responsible for relief, striving for the revival of the rural areas. The villagers in these areas have suffered robbery and slaughter by the Red bandits. Without substantial relief, the people will not be able to live and work in peace. The central government has already formulated measures for relieving the recovered bandit areas, such as building bandit-proof projects to prevent the bandits from invading again, and recruiting vagrants and local bullies to avoid their being used by the bandits. All of these have been handled according to the set measures. As for the internal organization of the communists, whether male or female, young or old, they all have considerable organization, so the severity of the damage to the local area is indeed beyond what we can achieve.</p>
<p>Chahar Situation: Mr. Yang also said that Chairman Chiang has always maintained a peaceful attitude towards the Chahar incident, hoping to resolve it peacefully within the possible scope. He also hopes that Feng Huanzhang will leave Chahar as soon as possible. Mr. Feng has no real power; what he relies on is the anti-Japanese banner. Mr. Ge Baichuan has always taken the central government's intention as his intention and has no problems. It was recently learned that Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi will go north to mediate the Chahar affairs, but it is now said that this trip may be canceled. Mr. Yang plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Nanjing to report. Mr. Yang has denied rumors that he will preside over Hubei province.</p>

<h3 id="e155">New Tax Rates for Liquor and Tobacco to Take Effect Tomorrow <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Orders Seven Provincial Bureaus to Comply</p>
<p>And Promulgate to the People in Various Places for General Knowledge</p>
<p>In order to rectify the liquor and tobacco tax, the Ministry of Finance plans to abolish the public sales system and separately formulate regulations on special taxes for native tobacco leaves and fixed tax rates for native liquor. It is scheduled to begin on July 1st, with pilot implementation in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Although the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Liquor Trade Association went to Beijing to petition, it was ultimately not accepted. Therefore, the new tax rates are inevitable. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance yesterday issued an order to the stamp tax bureaus for tobacco and liquor in the seven provinces, limiting the collection to begin on July 1st, and to promulgate it widely for general knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="e156">General Order <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of orders, the fixed tax for native liquor in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian is scheduled to begin on July 1st of this year. The Taxation Department has already issued orders to the bureaus in each province to comply, and has successively issued regulations and sample documents. However, at the beginning of implementing a new system, it is necessary to clearly inform the merchants and people of the purpose of the reform to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, the Ministry has drafted a proclamation, which is issued to the bureaus in each province to forward to their respective sub-bureaus for widespread posting, so that even remote rural areas may be informed. The main points of the regulations on the collection of fixed tax and the fixed tax rates for native liquor should also be announced in detail by the bureaus in each province so that merchants can comply. This fixed tax must be initiated on July 1st of this year as scheduled. All previously collected public sales fees and taxes will be canceled from the same date and no longer collected. The existing local surtaxes should continue to be handled temporarily according to the previous number and limit of the old cases. If there are no surtax items, no new ones should be added. In addition to instructing the stamp tax bureaus for tobacco and liquor in each province to comply, and consulting the governments of each province to instruct local officials to assist in the implementation, this order is issued with a copy of the proclamation and draft consultation, ordering the bureaus to comply. Furthermore, this reform is the initial foundation for establishing unified collection. The bureau chiefs must supervise their subordinates to faithfully implement it. If there is any insincere compliance, it will be severely punished upon discovery, without any leniency. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Proclamation <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Proclamation, the method of taxation values simplicity, and the key to reform lies in uniformity. The current tax system for native tobacco and liquor in various provinces has long followed old customs. The provinces are extremely diverse, and the procedures are inconsistent. Each province governs itself, and the rules are difficult to follow. Deep-seated malpractices have caused difficulties for both superiors and subordinates. Unless it is cleared up on a large scale, it will not be sufficient to enrich taxes and benefit the people. The Ministry has considered the situation, deliberated several times, and believes that the way to improve is to simplify and unify the collection. In March of this year, the Taxation Department was ordered to convene a meeting of the directors of the stamp tax bureaus for tobacco and liquor in each province to determine principles and begin rectification. Now, the tax system will be reformed in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Fujian first. The stamp tax bureaus for tobacco and liquor in each province have been supervised to investigate the situation and separately reform the special tax for native tobacco. All types of native liquor have now been investigated for their production and sales situation and classified into several categories. According to the fixed tax for liquor promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, if production and sales are within the same province, the tax will be collected in the place of production according to the fixed tax rates. If it is shipped to other provinces for sale and is within the scope of the seven provinces implementing the fixed tax, the fixed tax of the selling province should be paid again when it is transported into the selling province. After the fixed tax has been paid by the producer and seller, within the borders of their respective provinces, in addition to customs duties and liquor and tobacco license taxes, which will still be collected according to regulations, and local surtaxes that were handled before the reform will also be handled temporarily according to the original number and limit of the original actual collection, no other taxes will be levied. The aforementioned tax rates are all calculated based on quantity, without the past malpractices of excessive or insufficient taxation based on value, and can be classified as simple. Merchants and people can easily understand the tax amount payable. It is similar to gradual progress, which can enter into the right track. The procedures for collecting the fixed tax for native liquor have been formulated and promulgated by the Ministry and will be implemented from July 1st of this year. All previously collected public sales fees and taxes will be canceled from the same date. In short, this reform by the Ministry is based on the principle of abolishing excessive harassment and striving for the convenience of merchants and people. All merchants and people should uniformly comply with the new regulations and pay taxes. If they intend to wait and see or obstruct the process, they will be severely investigated. In addition to ordering the stamp tax bureaus for tobacco and liquor in each province to announce the procedures for collecting the fixed tax for native liquor and the newly established fixed tax rates in detail, and to start on schedule, this proclamation is hereby issued.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that after the China National Aviation Corporation plane departed from Shanghai at 8:20 a.m. yesterday (the 28th), it flew along the Yangtze River. When it reached 90 miles from Nanjing, it suddenly encountered heavy fog. For safety reasons, the pilot landed the plane on the river. After waiting for 25 minutes, the thick fog began to dissipate. Before taking off, he suddenly felt that the plane was moving slowly. Another pilot urgently inspected the entire plane and saw that the fuselage had cracked and leaked, and water had accumulated to a foot deep. He quickly drained the water, and with the help of passenger Bailey, it took about an hour to drain the water before he could take off again. He then turned back to Shanghai for repairs and arrived at Longhua at 12:30 p.m. Although Bailey experienced this setback, he still plans to take a plane to Jiujiang today (the 29th) and go to Guling for two months to escape the summer heat.</p>

This will not only connect international emotions but also allow Chinese aviators to have the opportunity to contact each other, so as to gain the real benefits of research and improvement.</p>

<p>National Federation of Commerce Reissues Circular Telegram</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously received a notice from the Ministry of Industry to inform all companies to apply for registration in accordance with the law. The deadline was the end of June of this year. However, due to transportation obstacles in many places, it was difficult to comply uniformly. Considering the difficulties of merchants, the Ministry of Industry has again notified an extension of three months, from July 1st to September 30th. No further extensions will be granted after the deadline. After receiving the telegram, the Federation of Commerce reissued a circular telegram yesterday. The original text of the telegram is recorded as follows: "To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, for the information of all domestic and foreign chambers of commerce: Regarding the case of ordering all companies to apply for registration in accordance with the law, this Federation previously received a notice from the Ministry of Industry, which was forwarded by circular telegram. On June 28th of this year, we again received Notice No. 18509 from the Ministry of Industry, which stated that the deadline for the announcement that all companies should comply with the law and apply for registration was the end of June of this year. The Ministry had already notified this on December 24th of last year and forwarded it to all chambers of commerce for uniform compliance. Many have already complied with the regulations and applied for registration, but there are still many who have not been able to apply for registration by the deadline due to transportation obstacles in the region. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, the Ministry has specially extended the deadline for another three months, from July 1st to September 30th of this year. It should be known that registration in accordance with the law is of great importance to the legal rights and interests of merchants and people. If companies that have already been established still do not apply for registration by the deadline, the competent authorities in each locality should strictly ban them and investigate them in accordance with the law. In addition to circulating and publishing the notice in newspapers for general knowledge, this notice is sent to the Federation of Commerce, ordering them to instruct all subordinate chambers of commerce to notify all merchants to comply uniformly. The Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, bows, with an official seal."</p>

They then went to the Executive Yuan, where Councillor Chen received them, saying that local self-government is the basic work of the tutelage period, and the Shanghai Municipal Government should be urged to speed up its implementation to live up to the expectations of the citizens. Later, they went to the Ministry of Interior to petition, requesting that the Ministry use effective methods to promote the realization of local self-government in Shanghai. All provinces and cities across the country have gradually carried out local self-government, but Shanghai, as a major trading port, has failed to do so, which is a shame for the citizens. The section chief of self-government, Yang Wenzhao, replied that the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government to find a way to resume and actively carry out the work.

<h3 id="e165">Letter from Party Headquarters of Two Railways <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Railway Bureau to Announce Salary Increase Quickly</p>
<p>Workers Have Already Been Announced, but Staff and Clerks Have Not</p>
<p>People Are Anxious, Work Is Unstable, Should Be Announced Quickly</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency, Shanghai - Because of the routine annual seniority salary increase, the Bureau has not yet announced it this year. They have repeatedly requested the Railways and Railway Authorities to implement it as soon as possible. The Railways and the Railway Bureau have only promised to determine the salary increase standard after performance evaluation. The staff and clerks are dissatisfied and insist on implementing the ordinary seniority salary increase. The Railway Bureau promised to request instructions from the Ministry of Railways and then respond. It has been many days since then, but there has been no formal response. The special party headquarters of the two railways, according to the request of the party headquarters of each district, specially sent a letter to the Railway Bureau, requesting that it announce it quickly to reassure the staff and clerks. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, according to the request of the Executive Committee of the Fourth District Party Headquarters, since the opening of our two railways, the treatment of employees has been quite thorough, and the salary increase of employees is the only hope of our employees. Therefore, employees work hard and do their best to increase their salary and solve the difficulties of life. The workers' salary increase for this year has already been announced, but the staff and clerks' salary increase has not yet been announced, causing the staff and clerks to feel anxious and work uneasily. The staff and clerks and workers of the two railways are like the hands and feet of a human body. Since their obligations are the same, their treatment should also be the same. How can we value one over the other? For the sake of the future of the Railway Bureau and the livelihood of the staff and clerks, it seems necessary to actively resolve the matter. Therefore, it was proposed and discussed at the first plenary session of the Fourth District Representative Congress that a request should be submitted to the special party headquarters to forward it to the Central Committee to order the Ministry of Railways to announce the annual seniority salary increase for the staff and clerks of the two railways in 1933 as soon as possible, so as to expect equal treatment and comfort the public, so that each staff and clerk can work at ease and the future of railway affairs will be more beneficial. The resolution was passed and recorded. We hereby submit the case to your council for review, and we beg you to forward it for the convenience of the party. The Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Two Railways, etc. The Sixth District Party Headquarters also submitted a similar request. Accordingly, we hereby send a letter to your Bureau, requesting that you look into the matter and announce the annual seniority salary increase for the staff and clerks of this year as soon as possible. We hope to receive a reply. To the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway Administration."</p>

However, time flies, and the term will expire on July 4th. The contract should be fulfilled or renewed. However, the charitable organizations United Relief Association believed that Wang would come to Shanghai soon, and his family members might move, so they advocated not renewing the contract, presumably asking Li Yanshi to change the way of handling it. At first, Li refused, causing problems. After repeated consultations, Li finally agreed to extend the term by one month.</p>

<p>Huang Xuzhu, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 21 Puqing Lane, Malang Road, French Concession, is 16 years old. On the 17th of this month, she had a letter sent to her by her classmate Dai Yaotian from the Liangyou School in Hongkou and delivered to the post office. However, Ye Woyun, a postman from the K'ai-tzu-erh Road postal branch (30 years old, resident of No. 157 Wangzhi Road), delivered the letter to Xu Binglong, a local teenager at No. 7 Cishou Lane, Saporsey Road (20 years old, currently unemployed). Xu opened the letter and read it, then drew a turtle on the back of the envelope and turned the letter over to Huang.

<p>and sent them two identical letters from Dai (test letters). On the afternoon of the 28th (the day before yesterday), they still dispatched the 166 postman to deliver them, and sent patrols Zhu Wenyi and Li Jinlong to secretly follow Ye to investigate. At 3:30, patrol Li Jinlong waited at the entrance of Cishou Lane, Saporsey Road, and saw postman Ye Woyun of the 166 riding a bicycle and delivering the letter to No. 7, handing it over to Xu Binglong and leaving. Li immediately chased to the front of No. 7 to investigate. He happened to see Xu and Qiu holding the letter and opening it to read it next to the cobbler's stall at the entrance of the lane. Li found out the truth and reported it to the bureau. The director reported to the Xiafei Road police station that Xu and Qiu obviously colluded with the postman to</p>
<h3 id="e170">open other people's private letters, <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>which violated the criminal law. The police station sent detectives Ding Wensheng and Guo Bingquan to arrest postman Ye Woyun and Xu and Qiu together and bring them to the eighth criminal court of the court. At 4 p.m., Judge Wu Fanglian took the stand and interrogated them. First, police station lawyer Yuan Jiahan explained the case, and said that the police station was prosecuting the first defendant Ye Woyun for dereliction of duty under Article 138 of the Criminal Code, and the second and third defendants Xu Binglong and Qiu Yuansheng for violating privacy under Article 333 of the Criminal Code, and requested that they be investigated and handled according to law. He also presented four letters. Huang Baohua, a patrolman from the postal bureau, arrived on behalf of the plaintiff, the postal bureau, and stated the previous situation.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Witness Postal Bureau Patrol <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Li Jinlong testified, "That day, I and another patrolman were at the entrance of Cishou Lane, and saw a postman from the 166 riding a bicycle to deliver a letter. When he entered the lane, we heard someone clapping. Postman Ye Woyun stopped and handed the letter to Xu Binglong inside No. 7. After receiving the letter, Xu returned to his home and came out with Qiu Yuansheng holding the letter. I hurried up and saw that it was a Liangyou envelope. He was opening it next to the cobbler's stall at the entrance of the lane. At that time, someone said that opening other people's private letters was a crime. Qiu replied that it was a letter from my mistress in Hongkou. It doesn't matter to take a look. I immediately returned to the bureau to report." When interrogated, postman Ye Woyun confessed, "I have seen Xu and Huang reading books and talking together before, and Xu told me that he and</p>
<h3 id="e172">Huang are family <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Xu used to receive letters for Huang before, so I trusted him as family. Xu often told me that if Huang had a letter, I could hand it over to him to forward. That's why I handed Huang's letter to Xu to forward this time. I don't know what else is going on." When questioned, Xu Binglong confessed, "I used to be neighbors with Huang, and we have always been on good terms. She sent me photos and entrusted me to open her letters, so I dared to receive and read the letters for her. I didn't write the turtle on the back." Qiu Yuansheng confessed and denied opening the letter. "When I was repairing the lights in Judge Huang's house in the third special district court, I saw a letter with a turtle on the back, which I drew. I was just joking, but I don't know who sent it to whom, and I didn't have any intention." After repeated cross-examination in court, the defendants' confessions were all evasive and deniable. Finally, Huang and Wu were questioned. According to the confession, although they knew one of Xu and Qiu, they did not entrust them to look at their letters. At this point, the officials began to argue. After the police station lawyer and Ye's lawyer argued, the court declared the debate closed and ordered the defendants to be detained for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, stating: Minister Chen Jun of the Ministry of Industry, esteemed Sir, the silk industry bank of this city, based on its long-standing commitment to serving the community, jointly with the two trade associations of the silk fabric industry and the electric silk reeling factory industry of this city, is co-organizing the Chinese National Silk Exhibition, scheduled to begin on July 9th of this year.

<p>it difficult, greatly affecting the business of the cooperative. At the same time, the weighing merchants, etc., intended to move their business location to the entrance of the cooperative, hoping to find a way. The society quelled the matter, and no accidents occurred. The disturbance was quite severe.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Mediation Process <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>After the dispute occurred, Hong Jianxiang, the municipal commissioner of the district, first took the lead in mediation, but it failed. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau received a report that the weighing merchants, etc., were issued licenses by the Finance Bureau, and their business locations were regulated and could not be moved casually, let alone obstruct the business of the cooperative for no reason. Therefore, it joined forces with the Finance Bureau to send personnel to investigate and ordered the weighing merchants to operate at designated locations. If there were violations or casual movements, the licenses would be revoked.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Police in Huijiao Township Drown a Person While Arresting Gamblers <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Villagers Who Fell Into the Water Were Threatened and Not Allowed to Come Ashore</p>
<p>If the Police Are So Violent, the Common People Will Have No Way to Survive</p>
<p>A case of police arresting gamblers and causing a drowning in Huijiao, a place in the southwest of this county, has occurred. The details are recorded below. Huijiao is located about three li southwest of Maqiao. To the west of Huijiao is the Yutang Port, to the east is the Dong Yutang River, to the south of the bridge is the border between Songjiang and Suzhou, and to the north of the bridge is the boundary of Shanghai County. It belongs to Yong'an Township in Maqiao District. On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, at about 4 PM, eight people wearing plain clothes entered the teahouse opened by Jiang Weishi at the north end of Huijiao, claiming that they were police from Maqiao Town and had come to arrest gamblers. At that time, there were three tea drinkers sipping tea. The villagers were all frightened and ran away. At that time, a villager named Zhu Quanlin (40 years old, from Sanyang Township, Minhang First District, Dong Yutang) was washing his feet on the river beach bridge in front of the machine factory next to the teahouse (that is, West Yutang). Those people immediately pointed at Zhu as a gambler and rushed to arrest him. Zhu did not know why he was being arrested. In a moment of desperation, he jumped into the river and swam away, intending to go ashore on the opposite bank. Unexpectedly, those people rushed to the south bank of the river and threatened him with guns, prohibiting him from going ashore. On the north bank, there were also people holding guns and shouting to stop him. Zhu lingered in the river, not allowed to go ashore. Zhu was in a dilemma in the river and extremely anxious. When he swam to the Huijiao pier (about ten zhang from the water bridge), he hugged the wooden stakes under the bridge with both hands and cried for help. (At that time, according to rumors, those people fired two shots, and a person named Hu Huanxiang passed by. Zhu cried out to Huanxiang to save him. When Huanxiang heard the sound and rushed up, he was kicked violently by those people, who said it was none of his business and told him to get out of here quickly. This is noted for now.) At the same time, those people threw bricks and stones at Zhu's head. Zhu was injured and let go, and immediately sank to the bottom of the river and did not float up for a long time. At that time, more and more villagers gathered and, seeing that lives were being lost, they captured those people. At that time, the township chief Zhang Zhongmei heard the news and rushed over. After inquiring, he learned that those people were indeed police from the Sixth District Police Station of Maqiao Town, including officer Zhang Rong and policeman Wang Tiekai. They were not humiliated. There were also patrol leader Xie Fengshan, policemen Jiang En, Wang Lizhang, Xu Enpei, Hua Kegong, Xu Jinhe, and others, a total of six people, who were all angered by the public and tied up with ropes. Because those people were not wearing uniforms and had no symbols (according to the regulations, the township chief should be notified first to avoid misunderstandings), the situation escalated. Xie Fengshan and others were tied up and sent to Sanyang Township, handed over to township chief Nie Shouxian, who escorted them to the Hehangqiao Security Corps overnight before releasing them. (Unexpectedly, the police also beat the escorts.) The next day, they were transferred to the Minhang First District Police Station, and then brought back by Director Zhao of the Maqiao Sixth District. However, after Zhu drowned, Zhang Rong (officer) who caused the trouble, promised to pay for the salvage. Then, at one o'clock that night, he was salvaged with great difficulty and temporarily placed on the river beach south of Huijiao (which is the boundary of Songjiang County). At that time, township chief Wu Yusheng of that place reported to the Songjiang County Government and sent personnel to inspect. At the same time, township chief Nie Shouxian of Sanyang Township reported to the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office for inspection. The day before yesterday, prosecutor Wu Deying, commissioned, took prosecutor Xuan Zhiming to the countryside and inspected the body of the deceased Zhu Quanlin, finding a scratch on his forehead and determining that he had drowned. The coroner ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial pending investigation. Yesterday, the Shanghai County Police Bureau transferred Zhang Rong, Xie Fengshan, Jiang Shouen, Xu Enpei, and Xu Jinhe to the local court for questioning. After a preliminary trial, they were ordered to be detained pending thorough investigation. Moreover, Zhu Huanlin, the brother of the deceased, submitted a statement to the court, stating that the deceased had an 83-year-old mother, as well as a wife and three daughters, and the whole family depended on the deceased for a living. Now, the police abused their power and brutally killed innocent people. On the pretext of arresting gamblers, when people fell into the water, they did not provide assistance but instead forced them to stay ashore. When the younger brother of the civilian was exhausted, he threw huge stones at his head and then shot him with a gun, firing two shots. At this point, my younger brother was physically unable to support himself and was hit so hard that he was swept into the whirlpool and died. The police were originally peacekeepers. When performing their duties, they should wear uniforms and symbols and be peaceful. No matter what kind of criminal behavior, it should not be forced to death. The police were so ignorant and violent. Where is humanity? Where is conscience? The police officers were so barbaric that it showed that the director of the bureau was usually negligent in training and ineffective in managing subordinates. The fault of dereliction of duty is undeniable. If a thorough investigation is not conducted, the good people will have no way to survive in the future, and so on, awaiting instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Strike by Weighing Merchants in Zhenru <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Mediates and Resolves the Situation</p>
<p>According to Dabaisha, more than ten weighing merchants in Zhenru, including Xie Xingji, went on strike due to opposition to the business of the Zhenru District Rural Marketing Cooperative, causing a strike. The Fourth District, Third Precinct of the Public Security Bureau temporarily mediated the situation, and it was quickly resolved. After the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus received the report, they sent personnel to investigate the truth and investigate the instigators yesterday morning at 10 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e182">Cause of the Dispute <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Some local enthusiasts in Zhenru District, such as Zhou Dinghua, Shen Zhongyi, Zhou Mucai, Lei Qinfang, Mao Xueyao, etc., in view of the fact that the rural industry in this city was on the verge of bankruptcy after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, specially applied to the Social Affairs Bureau at the end of last year to initiate the organization of the Zhenru District Rural Marketing Cooperative, using cooperative methods to transport and sell agricultural products for farmers. However, the ordinary weighing merchants in the district used various methods against the cooperative.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Large-Scale Electricity Theft Case Concluded <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>=Even the Director of the Investigation Division of the Electric Power Company Was Involved=</p>
<p>=He Leaked the Date of Dispatching Personnel to Copy Electricity Meter Readings in Advance=</p>
<p>丨The Debate Ended Yesterday, and the Verdict Will Be Announced Next Monday丨</p>
<p>Recently, the General Patrol Room cracked a large-scale electricity theft case. Those who participated in the theft work were employees of the Electric Power Company and laid-off workers, who specialized in stealing electricity for various factories and large businesses. For example, if the electricity used by each factory each month was 500 units, the workers would come before the end of the month to destroy the lead seal engraved by the Electric Power Company on the meter, open the meter, and try to reverse the Arabic numerals recording the electricity used, so that 500 units would be changed to 300 units or 200 units. Then, they would close the meter door and affix a forged lead seal. The lead seal was very similar to the one affixed by the Electric Power Company, and it was difficult to distinguish at a glance. Even employees of the Electric Power Company could not detect it. They then shared the remaining profits with the manufacturers. After several months of investigation by Lu Liankui, the Chief Inspector of the General Inspection Office of the Public Concession, the conspiracy was revealed. The thieves Cheng Zhangcai, Zhang Yulin, Liu Zhaoji, Huang Youliang, and Xu Quanlin were arrested. It was found that Xu was currently the Director of the Investigation Division of the Electric Power Company, Zhang and Huang were both workers, Cheng was formerly a worker of the Electric Power Company and had been laid off, and Liu was a coppersmith. Many forged lead seals and a branding iron were seized. It was also found that Cheng and others had committed theft on behalf of dozens of businesses, such as Tianwei Textile Factory on Bailinan Road, Guohua Factory on the same road, Dongfang, Hengfeng, and Youfeng Three Silk Factory on Yulin Road, China Department Store on Nanjing Road, Dahua Department Store, Jiuchun Silk Factory on Hede Road, and Yuandong and Jinya Two Silk Factory on Taopeng Road. Therefore, the Public Concession attorney Ru Baoyi filed a public prosecution against Cheng and the other five people with the First Special Court on charges of theft, forgery of documents, etc., under Articles 338, 340, and 234 of the Criminal Code. Because the Electric Power Company did not want to pursue the matter, the businesses were listed as witnesses. Various aspects of the case have been tried once and have been reported previously. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court held a second hearing. Attorney Ru of the Patrol Room first stated that the defendant Xu Quanling colluded with Cheng Zhangcai to hand over the date table of when the Electric Power Company would dispatch personnel to various users to copy the electricity meter readings to Cheng, so that Cheng could reduce the number of meter readings before the deadline. Cheng benefited, so he gave Xu a certain amount. Therefore, when Cheng was detained, a copy of the above-mentioned form was seized, which was actually given by Xu. When questioned, Xu Quanling denied this fact, only stating that Cheng had asked me about the departure date of the meter readers in February of this year. Because he was a former colleague, I did not suspect anything and told him it was around the fourth or fifth day of the month. I did not expect him to do this. I really did not know. When Cheng Zhangcai was questioned, he took full responsibility, saying that he did this with a certain Zhou and that it had nothing to do with anyone else. Judge Feng then questioned each defendant one by one and then ordered the start of the debate. After Attorney Ru and defense attorneys Fan Gang, Shen Xingxia, Lin Rongqing, Zhang Shewo, Xu Jie, and others debated, the court ordered that the verdict be announced next Monday.</p>
<p>According to the license, and shall not obstruct the business for no reason. Both parties shall not interfere with each other. At the same time, the cooperative side, in order to avoid conflicts, also expressed that it would temporarily operate indoors, and the matter came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Sudden Strike <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, agricultural products are in the peak season. For the sake of their own interests, farmers mostly transport and sell to the cooperative. The business of the weighing merchants has plummeted. Therefore, last Monday, on the pretext that the cooperative's goods were piled up at the entrance, they gathered hooligans to prepare to use force and go on strike to coerce the cooperative to stop operating. After receiving the news, Yao Guangnai, the head of the Fourth District, Third Precinct, believed that the strike by the weighing merchants during the peak season of agricultural products would affect the livelihood of farmers. He immediately took the lead in mediation and persuaded both parties to request instructions from the competent authorities. For the time being, they would continue to operate as usual, and the matter temporarily subsided.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Two Bureaus Investigate <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>After receiving a formal report, the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus believed that the coercion and strike by the weighing merchants was improper. Therefore, yesterday morning at 10 AM, Hang Ding'an of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with personnel from the Finance Bureau and the Municipal North Inspection Office, went to the site to investigate the actual situation, investigate the instigators, and punish them according to law. They also inquired about everything from the Fourth District, Third Precinct. According to Hang, the weighing merchants should not coerce and strike under any circumstances. Now, after studying the information obtained from the inquiry, the two bureaus will jointly discuss a solution, and the Public Security Bureau will implement it accordingly.</p>

<p>The Yixing steamer of the Jiejiang Company arrived in Shanghai from Yichang on the 24th of this month. When it reached Hankou, due to the impact of severe flooding, it collided with a sea vessel, initially damaging the propeller blades. It then crashed into the outer hull of the midship engine room. Had it not quickly reversed, the Yixing steamer would have been split in two. Fortunately, the Hankou branch dispatched a ship and used cement and wooden planks to patch the damaged areas. It was then towed to Shanghai by the Yiping steamer for major repairs. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The damage to the steamer is extensive.</p>

The letter to the industry association, forwarded to the municipal chamber of commerce to solicit publicity and sales for other factories, is transcribed below. It reads: "To Whom It May Concern, Our company is now planning to develop overseas trade and promote domestic products to foreign countries. We have decided to send a specialist to visit the islands of Southeast Asia and India in order to investigate the commercial situation and establish a basis for future development. It has been decided to set sail on August 1st. In the islands of Southeast Asia, many of our countrymen reside, while in India, there is an active boycott of foreign goods. This is an excellent opportunity to develop national products. If any domestic goods manufacturers wish to entrust their exquisite products to be carried abroad for publicity and sales, our company is very willing to accept. For this reason, we are writing to your association, forwarding it to the municipal chamber of commerce, to inquire with local domestic goods manufacturers. Those interested should come to our company at the above address before August 1st to discuss in person. This matter concerns the promotion of foreign trade and we hope you will not refuse. This is for the public good."</p>

<p>| An Autopsy Will Be Performed to Determine the Cause of Death |</p>
<p>Zhang Deyi, a patrolman from the First Precinct of the Southern District, was 39 years old and from Nangong County, Hebei Province. He had been a policeman in the precinct for more than ten years. He had no faults in his daily life. Seven years ago, he cohabited with a woman surnamed Zhang from Jiangbei and lived in Xinhou Zhangjia Alley. They had a son and a daughter, aged six and two respectively. The couple had previously been quite harmonious, but recently they had frequent disputes. At 8:00 PM the night before last, after dinner at home, he went to the police station on duty. At midnight, he was assigned to patrol near the Qinglong Bridge Qinglong Temple when he suddenly clutched his stomach in pain and fell to the ground, unable to get up. Two rickshaw pullers who were sleeping outdoors saw this and came forward to watch. Zhang Deyi's mouth and nose were bleeding, and he was unable to speak. One of them reported it to the police station, and someone sent Zhang to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. By the time the police station received the news and sent someone to investigate, Zhang had died. The time was 1:45 AM. Because the deceased had blood coming from his mouth and nose, and his fingernails were cyanotic, as if he had taken poison, the news was conveyed to his niece-in-law, Zhang Xu (who lived at Wangjia Wharf). According to her, her husband's uncle's death was greatly related to his wife and there had been divorce disputes. She therefore demanded a thorough investigation. The director summoned Qin Defang, the local head of the 23rd Pu, to report to the local court for an autopsy. It is reported that the case will be subjected to an autopsy to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>= Overwhelmed by Debt, He Commits Suicide by Taking Poison, and Still Calls a Prostitute for Entertainment Before Death =</p>
<p>Xu Jiafu, from Ningbo, was only in his early twenties. He worked as a clerk at the Zhenfeng Cotton Mill at 33 Henan Road. He was fond of wandering around, so his salary was never enough to cover his expenses, resulting in a mountain of debt that he could not repay. The day before yesterday, after thinking about it, he felt that there was no point in living in the world and decided to end his life. He went to the New Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road alone and booked room 401. He then ordered a bowl of snacks from the tea server. After eating, he still felt lonely, so he summoned a prostitute named Zhao Meiyu to accompany him. That evening, he committed suicide by swallowing opium. At about 6:00 AM the next morning, the woman woke up and saw Xu moaning. She was extremely frightened and ran out to inform the hotel staff, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he soon died. The hospital reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered detective Cao Qishan to investigate. Two suicide notes were found near the deceased's body, stating that he had taken this step due to economic difficulties. The detective then carried the body to the Fellen Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, came to the morgue to examine the body and ascended to the judge's seat. According to Zhao Meiyu, she was 16 years old. The deceased called her to go there at about 11:00 PM that night. She immediately went to take a bath, but he did not want to. She did not know him and it was their first meeting. She did not know that he had taken opium and committed suicide until she saw his pale face in the morning. According to Wang Zhisun, the deceased was his relative, and his family was all in his hometown. He requested permission to claim the body. After hearing the confession, Mr. Guo ruled that the deceased, Xu Jiafu, had indeed died of opium poisoning. The body was handed over to Wang Zhisun for coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Collectors Have Reached Six-Tenths of the National Publications</p>
<p>Li Shizeng, et al. Host a Lecture by Martin</p>
<p>The Geneva Chinese International Library's Shanghai Office has been collecting books for several months. Many people from all walks of life have responded and donated. In addition to the three batches that have already been shipped, totaling more than 100,000 volumes, there are still hundreds of thousands of volumes, including duplicate books, which are planned to be kept in Shanghai to set up a branch library. At 5:00 PM yesterday, the Central Committee member Li Shizeng held a tea party for all circles in the World Society on Furguson Road to visit the displayed books and invited Martin, the editor of the Geneva newspaper, to give a lecture. The details are recorded on the left. Names of Attendees: The attendees yesterday included Martin, Chu Minyi, Zhang Gongquan, Xie Shou Kang, Liu Zhanen, Wang Xiaolai, Guo Dehua, Xu Xinliu, Su, Hualin, Ying Shi, Wang Yaxuan, Fang Fuan, and other Chinese and foreign guests, totaling more than two hundred people, hosted by Li Shizeng and the staff of the World Society.</p>
<p>Book Display: After arriving, the guests successively visited the books of the International Library, which were displayed separately in various rooms on the second and third floors. Most of them were ancient books, especially in the history section. The new books published by various publishing organizations were displayed in a corner on the third floor. According to the office staff, the collected books have reached six-tenths of the modern national publications and will continue to be sought to ensure that nothing is missed. In addition to sending the books to Geneva, a branch library will be set up in Shanghai for reference, they said. After the visit, they took photos in the lawn in front of the house and then went to the hall for the tea party.</p>
<p>Martin's Lecture: At 5:20 PM, Li Shizeng introduced Martin to the stage to give a lecture. Martin's topic was "The Swiss Federal System and China." After giving the lecture in French, it was translated by Shen Liang. The general idea was that Switzerland has the smallest land area in the world, while China has the largest land area. It seems that there is absolutely nothing in common between the two. However, if we study it carefully, the two countries, one large and one small, have many similarities. For example, the language and writing in Switzerland are in French and German, which are very inconsistent. Although Chinese characters are unified, the languages ​​are different in various places. In addition, although the Swiss territory is small, its complexity is not inferior to China. Therefore, the Swiss political system can be used for China to learn from. It lasted for more than an hour before it ended.</p>
<p>National Music Performance: After Martin's speech, the Datong Music Society played national music. First, Wu Zhaolan played the guqin "Stone Spring", followed by Wei Zhongle playing the pipa "Huaiyin Pingchu", the tempo was fast and slow, Ma Jiong's drums sounded, as if in a battlefield. Finally, the National Music Association played three chapters of the Great National Music and dispersed, when the clock struck seven o'clock. After the meeting, according to Guo Dehua, Martin will have a banquet tomorrow, and he is expected to return to Europe in four or five days.</p>

<p>Another Unexpected Event in the World Tennis Tournament</p>
<p>▲American Doubles Champion Barnes Imitates Gran Gale</p>
<p>▲Loses to Australian Quist and Turnbull Team</p>
<p>▲Singles British Lees Defeats McCrath</p>
<p>(London, 28th) Two surprising results occurred in this afternoon's Wimbledon tennis match, described as follows:</p>
<p>▲American Doubles Championship Failure</p>
<p>In the first week of the men's doubles, the South Australian youth players Quist and Turnbull defeated the American doubles champions Barnes and Gran Gale with a surprising performance. The American players won the first two sets, but afterwards, they were at a loss. Their opponents were full of energy and defeated them with fierce attacks. In the end, they lost three sets in a row, only getting eight games. Quist and Turnbull won 4-6, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.</p>
<p>▲Lees Defeats McCrath</p>
<p>In another match, the 17-year-old Australian youth McCrath was defeated by the British Davis Cup player Lees. The score was a straight three sets. Lees won easily with 6-4, 6-3, 6-1. Lees's shots were sharp and accurate. Although the 17-year-old Australian youth used the special skill of double-handed backhand to counterattack from time to time, it was not enough to stop the opponent's fierce attacks. It is unexpected that McCrath, who defeated the top Japanese player Sato in the Davis Cup rematch, lost to Lees in a straight three sets this time.</p>

<p>In addition to the Lees vs. McCrath group, the results of the other men's singles groups are as follows: (1) Cochern (France) defeated Bo Hui'er (USA) 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3; (2) Stetmen (New Zealand) defeated Condon (South Africa) 9-11, 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4; (3) Crawford (Australia) defeated Qin Ding (France) 6-3, 6-4, (8-6; (4) Sato (Japan) defeated Lesett (England) 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, 6-2; (5) Hughes (England) defeated Aoki (Japan) 6-2, 6-1, 6-0.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Renovation of Takahashi Swimming <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Among the seaside beaches, only Takahashi exists in Shanghai. Promoted by the municipal authorities last year, it once stirred things up. However, all the equipment was temporary in nature. Therefore, there was a lack of places to eat and drink. If there was unexpected weather, it was difficult to find a place to shelter from the rain. The most unpleasant thing was that there was no fresh water to rinse the body after bathing, which felt dirty and uncomfortable. Moreover, when the tide was low, the water was only head-high thirty to forty miles away from the beach, a muddy yellow, and there were no facilities, which made the learners uninterested, and the good swimmers had no place to show their heroism. Now, local gentry, Zhang Peigen and Zhao Fuji, etc., are building a magnificent seaside hotel for the sake of people in this city to cool off and swim. Facing the ocean, the cool breeze is pleasant, the layout is exquisite, and the equipment is complete. In the future, tourists will not have to travel six miles to Takahashi Town for a full meal. A few days ago, swimming experts from Shanghai, such as Yu Binqi and Wang Jianxin, were invited to Takahashi for consultation on the necessary equipment for swimming, such as water depth markers, relay buoys, ten rowing boats, to accompany long-distance swimmers to exert their power as much as possible, bamboo poles, and galvanized iron buckets were prepared for beginners to float, and there were also lifeboats and other insurance to make the swimmers happy and clean. The neat tents and fresh water were all available. In addition, the high tide this year has made things even better. It is said that it will open on the ninth of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Dextral Winding Wind-Fixing Snail <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Among the clear and rich antiques, there is a dextral winding wind-fixing snail; pearls do not have dextral or sinistral winding distinctions, it is probably a dextral winding wind-fixing snail.</p>
<p>"A small divine snail, four inches, like a fist, divine incense offered to guide the star ship; peace and fulfillment, wind gone, not allowing whale waves to crash across the sky," this is from Chen Zhongbo of Qiantang's "Traces of Ryukyu Shoes"; Zhongbo accompanied the esteemed Qian Xing as an envoy to Ryukyu during the Qing Daoguang era to enshrine the King of Zhongshan. As per usual, a dextral winding white snail was offered in the ship, said to avoid wind and waves. Zhongbo's poem has a self-note: "During the Qianlong era, the Panchen Erdeni presented a dextral winding white snail; shaped like a fist, with a diameter of four inches and two fen, named wind-fixing snail; when Grand General Fukang'an conquered Taiwan, Emperor Gaozong ordered it to be moved from the palace. After the affair, it was left in the Fujian Governor's Office. The box had the words 'Protecting Safe Passage Across Rivers and Seas,' etc." Later, it was moved from the Governor's Office to the Provincial Governor's Office, this was the event in the fifth year of Jiaqing. At the time, Yue Wenkai and Ji Dingyuan were the appointed official and vice envoy to Ryukyu to enshrine the king. A dextral winding white snail was offered in the ship. On the seventh day of the fifth month, they set sail from Fujian. The wind and waves were calm and they arrived in Ryukyu in six days. The journey back was the same. In the eleventh year of Jiaqing, General Mian Chong'a conquered the pirate Cai Qian, Emperor Jiaqing once issued an edict: "Previously, when Fukang'an pacified Lin Shuangwen, he carried a propitious, auspicious, dextral winding snail across the sea. The sails were peaceful and smooth; now, it is distributed and handed to Mian Chong'a to respectfully carry along, to seek blessings for a safe crossing. On the day of the triumphant return after the affair, order a senior official to respectfully send it to the capital," and so on. In the tenth year, Qi Kun and Fei Xizhang were appointed official and vice star envoys to enshrine Ryukyu. A divine snail was offered in the ship. They encountered storms twice but were able to turn danger into safety. In the third collection of Emperor Qianlong's imperial poems and essays, there is a "Praise for the Dextral Winding White Snail," with a self-note: "Each year, the lamas in Tibet present Dan books during the New Year and the Emperor's birthday. Among the offered items, there is a dextral winding white snail. Those crossing the sea carry it on the ship, which brings auspiciousness and stability. It is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>The ability of the dextral winding white snail to fix the wind must be a kind of myth; however, during the Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Daoguang eras of the former Qing dynasty, it was regarded as a rare commodity. It was suddenly left in the outer provinces, and then suddenly handed over to the inner court. The common people did not know, and thought it was a wind-fixing pearl. Now the dextral winding wind-fixing pearl in the Qing Palace antiques is probably the propitious, auspicious, dextral winding white snail presented by the Erdeni of Tibet. At the time, enshrining Ryukyu and conquering Taiwan, the wind-fixing pearl was in the limelight. What about Ryukyu now? Gone! What about Taiwan? Gone! All that remains is this wind-fixing pearl passed down through generations; it is not "great benefit and auspiciousness," but rather "great loss and bad luck!" Wind-fixing pearl, wind-fixing pearl, what is its use? If there really is a wind-fixing pearl, then there must also be a water-avoiding pearl; now, during the "water disaster" in the Yangtze River basin, where can one find a life-saving water-avoiding pearl from Wang Pusa? Alas!</p>

<h3 id="e250">Summer Has Arrived <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>We hear the cuckoo calling "family after family cuckoo", knowing that the plum rain season has arrived, and the farmers are busy with work. When the girls of Denmark hear the first call of the cuckoo, they know that summer has arrived. They must listen carefully and ask the cuckoo to tell them how many more years they have to wait before they can get married; so the Danes say that the cuckoo is so busy answering so many questions that it has no time to build its own nest.</p>
<p>From a legendary point of view, the Danes are much more humorous than the English. Because in the first half of the year, when the lanes and alleys are filled with mud, the English often say: "Wait, wait until the cuckoo finishes cleaning up all the mud before we talk about it." Everyone knows that the cuckoo does not build nests. It is the swallow that cleverly builds nests with mud. Then, when the children hear this, they must wonder why the cuckoo has to go everywhere to clean up the mud? If the Danish explanation had not come first, this mystery would have been difficult to solve.</p>
<p>In Sussex, April 14 is called "Cuckoo Day" and April 15 is called "Swallow Day". There is a story to tell about why it is called "Cuckoo Day": it turns out that an old woman once flew to France on a broom handle and brought the first cuckoo back in a basket, brought it to Heathfield, and released the cuckoo. This day was April 14; and the place where the cuckoo was released is also famous, namely, where Jack Cade was killed in the rebellion. This is the origin of "Cuckoo Day".</p>
<p>The cuckoo is like this in foreign countries, but not so in China. We also call it the "Zi Gui" or "heartbreak bird," and the sound of its call seems to say, "It is better to return." Therefore, the legends about the cuckoo in our country are negative, decadent, and sad; only the legends about the cuckoo bird are positive, exciting, and happy. Now, we still abandon the cuckoo and take the cuckoo bird.</p>
<p>This year is the Year of National Goods, and it seems inappropriate to keep talking about foreign goods. However, we have had the principle of "Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning as the application," so we might as well have a "Cuckoo Day." Fortunately, our country is "founded on agriculture," although the depression of "cheap grain hurts farmers" has not yet disappeared, after all, we cannot even do without the cloth and rice. Grain still needs cloth, and rice still needs to be planted, so it is very appropriate to have a "Cuckoo Day." On this day, rural areas should hold ceremonies and give lectures on basic and practical knowledge related to agricultural affairs, so that farmers can listen and implement improvements, which will definitely be of great benefit. It is much better than pushing foreign goods with "Sacrifice Day," "Cutting Price Day," "Enduring Pain Day," etc., cutting off our own path to survival, and treating shamelessness as interesting.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Avoid <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Do not underestimate this word "avoid". In the history of human life, one cannot do without this page.</p>
<p>"Avoiding debt," "avoiding disaster," "avoiding crime," these are the daily routines of us common people.</p>
<p>"Avoiding birthdays," "avoiding guests," "avoiding the heat," that is not something everyone can do. If you did not knock through seventeen or eighteen wooden fish in your previous life, you will definitely not have this kind of good fortune in this life.</p>
<p>When people are poor, they must borrow money. The faces of creditors are prickly, and when they want you to repay, they will really force you to be helpless. The ancestor of borrowing money was King Zhou Xia. He, with the dignity of an emperor, even built a "debt platform." Did he not meet with creditors? You think the power of creditors is great or not? Nowadays, people have too much debt, so they fly far away and practice debt avoidance. There are also those who owe women money and often hide in bathhouses, which is also a very good method.</p>
<p>Speaking of avoiding disasters, there are quite a few types. The flood comes and confiscates your fields, houses, and livestock into the Crystal Palace. It does not rain for three years, and the land for a thousand miles is barren. You taste the flavor of digging up soil and root. When war breaks out, there are bombs dropped by airplanes overhead; there are big cannon shells and small bullets flying from both sides. When you encounter these three kinds of disasters, are you not going to flee to a safe zone? If you harden your head and say you will not flee, then Yama will definitely take you in.</p>
<p>Young brothers fight over women: poor friends injure people while robbing things. When things happen, they must go out to avoid the limelight. Friends who wield pens, if they are not careful in their words and offend the authorities, it is best to escape as soon as they hear the wind is bad. If the opposition gains power, if you are strong-willed and refuse to surrender, then it is best to take the thirty-six stratagems and flee.</p>
<p>These three kinds of avoidance are bitter, unfortunate, and also something people do not want to accept, but tens of millions of people are trying this taste.</p>
<p>"Avoiding birthdays," "avoiding guests," "avoiding the heat," if you want to avoid all three, you must be a local tycoon. When it comes to your own 45th or 50th birthday celebration; the birthdays of your wife and children; the death anniversaries of your parents, someone will naturally send birthday gifts and pay respects to the birthday star. It is okay to accept all the gifts, but you dare not accept the respects. You avoid it somewhere else to show that you are a humble and honest gentleman. When there are guests visiting on weekdays, if they are higher than me, you might as well welcome them warmly. If they are poor relatives and lame friends, you might as well order the doorman to block them, avoid them, and save a lot of trouble. When the hot summer weather arrives, even if you have installed air conditioning and electric fans at home, you must go to Guling, Qingdao, or Moganshan for a stroll, to show that you are a special class of person.</p>
<p>A lagging gentleman says: Noble people have three avoidances, "avoiding birthdays," "avoiding guests," "avoiding the heat"; poor people also have three avoidances, "avoiding debt," "avoiding disaster," "avoiding criminal punishment." The avoidance of noble people is magnanimous; the avoidance of poor people is often full of sorrow.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Hearing the Words, a Maiden's Heart Alarms; Aspirations for Ennoblement Vanish.</p>
<p>Listening to Songs, Envy Appears; the Body Remains Idle While the Nation Needs Service.</p>
<p>He walked into the room, smiling with a face full of wrinkles, stroking his pale goatee. As soon as he entered, he cupped his hands in greeting towards Guizhi, and said with a smile, "So it's the Yang family's old daughter. We live on the same street, and yet it's been half a year since we last met." Guizhi had no choice but to get up to greet him, giving him a nod. He smiled and said, "How is the old madam? The two of you must be working hard!" Guizhi, upon hearing these polite words from the old gentleman, naturally felt it would be impolite to turn around and leave immediately, so she sat down again. Mr. Niu, having read a few books after all, sat on a broken chair by the window, his face directly facing them. He stroked his beard a couple of times, and then smiled and said, "Why were you mentioning soldiers?" Liu's mother said, "The old girl has moved in next to a company commander. The old master is over sixty years old, and I can't help but worry for him." Mr. Niu nodded and said, "You've been through it yourself; you've become a frightened bird." Liu's mother raised her head and sighed softly, "Don't mention the past. Bringing it up really breaks my heart. My child's father married me, and in fifteen years, we didn't even live together for three full months. For three years in between, he was with the army, and there was no news. If my family hadn't had a bit of money and given me some allowance, I would have starved to death long ago. He always said to me, 'We can't be together often right now, but that doesn't matter, as long as you have enough to eat and drink. Just endure it. Endure it until I become a battalion commander, and everything will be fine.' I believed him, seeing how free many battalion commanders were. It was indeed much better than being a peasant. That's what I thought too. Who told me to marry a soldier? I could only endure it. That year, during the Battle of Nankou, he had already been promoted to company commander, and he was just one step away from becoming a battalion commander. But then, one time, he was ordered to lead a company to seize a mountain pass, and only three men came back. My child's father died in battle that day. I was only thirty-eight years old then, not old, but not young either. What could I do? I could only take my child and endure it.' Speaking of it, that was six or seven years ago now." (115)</p>
<p>Brief News: Red beans, also known as "seeds of longing," are treasures to poets and writers. Mr. Tao Shoubo of Jinshi Tao has seven or eight red beans, shaped like small chicken hearts, with a crystal-clear color like red jade. Mr. Tao does not wish to keep them to himself and wants to share them with fellow enthusiasts. Those who wish to obtain these treasures of the South can inquire at the Shanghai News office, located in Yoxin Lane on Second Ma Road.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Various Ways to Enjoy Watermelon <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Watermelon is a great way to beat the summer heat. It is prominently displayed in fruit stores and will soon flood the market. According to the "Four Barbarians Supplement," "The Hu people introduced this species during the Five Dynasties period." So, the watermelon we eat today has a Uyghur flavor.</p>
<p>Years ago, I heard that Wu Peifu's wife, Madam Zhang, transported a large batch of watermelons and used the ancient custom of the "watermelon battle" to reward the soldiers. The Master of Xinhange Pavilion wrote a poem about the watermelon battle: "Exciting the three armies to fight, especially marking the watermelon battle with a good name; the general needs to shake Madam's ingenuity; together they compose a poem about the watermelon battle."</p>
<p>Our Jiangsu province produces a lot of watermelons, so Huangdai watermelon seeds are famous throughout the country. Also, the watermelon produced in Fushan, Xikuatang, is praised for its loose, sweet taste and is considered a top-quality product.</p>
<p>People in Weiyang have a small craft, good at making watermelons into lanterns, with delicate figures, landscapes, flowers, birds, and fish. They are lit with candles inside, giving a deep green glow that is quite tasteful. It is a pity that this is a short-lived craft, as the watermelons easily rot.</p>
<p>Eating watermelon with sugar is a common thing. I heard that Americans like to eat watermelon with salt, considering it a delicacy. This is truly a vast difference in taste.</p>
<p>Removing the watermelon pulp and steaming a duck inside is fresh and delicious, called "watermelon duck." Our Jiangsu restaurants often have this dish in the summer.</p>
<p>The watermelons in Bian are very large, almost only one or two per load, each weighing fifty or sixty pounds, which is not surprising. So, several families join together to buy one, otherwise, a small number of people might not be able to finish it.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Seasonal Delicacies <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>I am very interested in cooking. When I was young, I always took over my mother's work on holidays, acting as a cook. The dishes I made were highly praised by my family. Recently, I have also hosted banquets several times due to events and have received unanimous praise from guests. I dare not boast, but although I lack talent in other areas, my talent for seasoning is indeed innate. I will choose a few seasonal delicacies to talk about and reveal my unique methods for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts. "Fresh Mushroom Stewed Tofu" "Identification of Mushrooms": Mushrooms are a type of cryptogamic plant. Mushroom filaments are colorless and thread-like, often parasitic on other objects, and have various reproductive methods. Asexually, the tips of the mushroom filaments split and separate, or form umbrella-like or sac-like structures, each containing spores. Sexually, the egg cells of the female organs are fertilized to form zygotes, which gradually germinate and grow, such as pine mushrooms and Huizhou mushrooms. Pine mushrooms and the like, which grow in dry, sunny places, are white or brown in color, have a fragrance, and do not change color when broken and exposed to the air, are non-toxic and edible. Those that grow in wetlands, are brightly colored, and the broken surface turns green, brown, or other colors when exposed to the air, and taste bitter, salty, and pungent, are poisonous and inedible. Vegetable restaurants and mushroom lovers, please pay attention! "Making Mushrooms": Take the non-toxic ones, wash them several times in clear water, and choose the ones with small maggots in the mushroom stems and remove them. Add salt and mix well, and place them in a ventilated place to dry. Then, fry them with sesame oil or soybean oil. You must use several slices of raw ginger in the oil, remove them after five minutes, and you can use them to stew tofu, stir-fry water bamboo shoots, or cook winter melon, all of which taste exceptionally delicious. However, my way of eating is different from others, not frying, not stir-frying, not cooking, but "stewing," called "Fresh Mushroom Stewed Tofu." Take dozens of fried mushrooms, place them at the bottom of a bowl, use tender tofu cubes, cut into small squares, and spread them evenly on top, then cover with seven or eight more mushrooms, add a little salt and sugar, two spoons of soy sauce, and two slices of raw ginger, and stew them in a rice cooker. When the rice is cooked, it is also ready, clear, fresh, and delicious, with a unique flavor. The method is not complicated, and mushroom lovers may wish to try it.</p>
<p>Lotus Leaf Steamed Pork The steamed pork in ordinary restaurants only uses rice flour, and the taste is very ordinary. Even those wrapped in lotus leaves do not pay attention to the freshness of the lotus leaves, and the ingredients and methods are different from what I have prepared. Now that "the lotus leaves reach the sky with endless green," I will describe the method as follows: Use half a catty of top-quality white rice flour, dry-fry it in a pot, fry it until it is yellow but not burnt. Separately, use two ounces of fried black sesame seeds, grind them finely, and mix them into the flour. Buy one or two catties of thin-skinned streaky pork, cut into rectangular pieces (any size), soak them in sesame oil, and pour in two mace of ground fennel, mix and let sit for three or four hours. Take out the pork, pour it into the fried rice flour, coat each piece thinly, and wrap each piece in a fresh lotus leaf. Then, place them in a steamer and steam them for an hour. It will have a different taste, clear fragrance, and be mellow, fatty but not greasy. If you make it according to this method, I can guarantee that you will be satisfied and that it will be far better than the products sold in the market.</p>

<p>Finance</p>
<p>Gold's Future Is Very Pessimistic</p>
<p>The benchmark gold price plummets by 13.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Miserable winds and bitter rains shroud the market all day.</p>
<p>Another new low of 852.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The gold market declined again yesterday, in fact, because the European gold standard countries were forced into a precarious situation. All countries are particularly paying attention to France. General psychological predictions say that France will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Britain and the United States. Reports from London financial circles also worry that changes will occur within three days. People's minds are extremely agitated and easily disturbed. Furthermore, the market is closing tomorrow, and sellers are even more emboldened. The US dollar continues to depreciate, and the situation is dangerous. In the early morning, although silver prices fell, exchange rates rose sharply, making it difficult to rise. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quoted exchange rate shrank by two-fifths, while the US exchange rate had to be lengthened by two-fifths due to the squeeze. The situation remained sluggish throughout. The market was even more panicked. The selling pressure in the market was constant. Although Mumbai fell by five annas, it was difficult to support. In this situation, the foreign exchange market also followed suit and loosened. There were rumors that France would decide to abandon the gold standard and that Song Ziwen had succeeded in borrowing money, and buying sentiment enveloped the entire market. At one point, the lowest price after the conversion was 852.5 yuan, with the premium still adding 100 yuan. The situation deteriorated throughout the day. The Netherlands' increase in the discount rate was also unfavorable. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 869 yuan, a slight drop of 2.8 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 8.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with the British pound tight and the US dollar firm. The near-term selling price for the British pound was one shilling and three pence 0.0625, and the US dollar was 27.5 yuan. Tongtai, Changheng, and Yu first sold, dropping from 9.5 yuan to 6 yuan. Huabi ate 125 of the October contract. Yuanmao, Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yongyifeng, Yongdafa, Yongyuansheng, and others collectively sold short. Although goods were sold, they were still able to rise to 73 yuan. Huabi Datong did 4375 of the US dollar for this month, and it was slightly tighter. The bank was willing to offer 8125 for the September US dollar. Ruikang, Yuansheng, and Yong turned around to sell short. Hengxing also sold. Yifengyong also came to sell off, and it fell to within 70 yuan. When it was learned that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quoted exchange rate shrank by two-fifths for the British pound and lengthened by two-fifths for the US dollar, it was a squeeze on the exchange rate. Xing Shangchang sold short. Shanghai came out with 28 yuan for October and fell to 67.3 yuan. Maijiali ate 28 yuan for October, and Fuchang bought in, hovering outside of 70 yuan. However, Chinese brokers sold short, and the 0.0625 contract was successfully sold short, and the price fell further downstream. At this time, although Hengxing sold short, Bingxing bought it, and the situation was still stable. When the bank was willing to fill 875 for the September US dollar, Qingfa, Yonghengxing, Tongtai, and Chang all sold, and it fell to 6.5 yuan. Mitsui suddenly ate 0.0625 for the October US dollar, followed by accepting 875 for September. Hengxing, Yuanchun, Qianchang, Xiangruixing all went long, and at one point it went outside the 70 yuan mark, reaching 0.4 yuan. Finally, Huabi filled 875 for the September US dollar, and Yifengyong, Hengxing, Fuchang, and Fuyu collectively sold short, falling to 66.6 yuan. After this, after struggling, the afternoon close was 866.8 yuan, and the goods were traded at the same price.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 867 yuan, and goods opened at 6.5 yuan. Yuanmaoyong rose from 6.7 yuan to 7.8 yuan. Zhenggin offered 6875 for the August US dollar in Korea. Hengxing and Hengyu sold goods short. Hongxing had the strongest selling intent. Maijiali ate 125 for October, and no one wanted 1875 for the following year. Tongyi, Richang, Dafa, and Yong sold to 3 yuan. Then, it was difficult to offer 25 for October. Yuanshengyong, Zhengchang, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, and Hengxing sold down to 0.02 yuan. Datong ate 8125 for the August US dollar. Mitsui ate 25 for October. Fuyu and Tongtai Chang went to 2.8 yuan. However, people's hearts were extremely empty. The Dalian gang and Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Hengxing sold again. Although Zhifengyong accepted, it seemed difficult to offer 375 for October, and it fell to 58.5 yuan. Mumbai reported a drop, and there was a rebound. When Dongya ate 375 for October, it stabilized slightly. Yuanheng, Yuanxingyong, Hengyu took the opportunity to go long at low prices. It was difficult to close 3125 for October, and it rebounded to 62 yuan. However, Huabi and Dongya still offered 25 for October, and it fell to within 60 yuan again. After this, the struggle was extremely long. In fact, there were quite a few large households who limited their purchases at 8 yuan. When goods were sold off, the Dalian gang, Zhifengyong, Tongfu, etc. followed suit and sold strongly, and it fell to 56 yuan. Sellers still took the opportunity to supply, and Zhifengyong and Fuchang sold even further to 52.5 yuan. Hengxing limited purchases, and the selling pressure was killed. Mitsui scraped 4375 for the October US dollar, and Qianchangxiang, Qingfayong, and Fuyu worked hard to accept short, and it pulled to 7 yuan. Hengyu and Hengxing still came to supply, but people's hearts had calmed down. Shanghai ate 375 for the October US dollar, and Changshengyong Zhengchang went long. The close was then 858 yuan, and goods were traded at 7.5 yuan. The highest price of the day was 873 yuan, and the lowest was 852.5 yuan, a difference of 20.05 yuan. As a result, it fell 13.8 yuan compared to the previous close. The quoted price was 27.25 yuan for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quoted US exchange rate, which was more than 880 yuan for the combined benchmark gold price. In terms of the closing price, it was about 20 yuan, more than 5.5 yuan stronger than the previous close. The booked price for this month was 889 yuan, 877 yuan for July, and 867 yuan for August. The water supplement in the morning was 889 yuan. The booked price for the after-market was 880 yuan for this month, 868 yuan for July, and 858 yuan for August. The water supplement was 880 yuan. The premium was still adding 100 yuan, and there were no transactions. The forward spread for July and August was paid to Yuanchun by Yuanmaoyong for 70 contracts, Reng Yong for 7 contracts, and Zhifengyong paid to Rengfa Yong for 133 contracts, all at 10.05 yuan. Rengfa Yong paid to Shenkang for 301 contracts, at 9.3 yuan. There were still 2,597 contracts left for this month and 2,891 contracts for July.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was extremely chaotic. Supply exceeded demand in the after-market. If not for the Dofollanor's accepting short, the sharp drop would have been even worse. In summary, Hengxing, Tongtai Chang, Ruixing, Ruikang, Yifengyong, Hongxing, Richang, Tongyi, Yuanxingyong, Zhifengyong, Hengyu, Wanxing, etc. all sold short. Bingxing, Yuanmao, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, and Changshengyong went long. Fuyu, Fa Yong, and Ruixing went short and then long. The Dalian gang netted about 600 contracts. Shunli's long and short positions were about the same. The gang was on the selling side in both the before-market and after-market. They netted over 500 contracts. There were a total of 26,572 contracts for the August chips.</p>

<p>Gold industry tilts, Dofollanor 8 million</p>
<p>According to foreign reports yesterday, the London big bars are shrinking by 125 for both near-term and long-term. US banks have not moved.

The US dollar was 27.5 yuan, which was 125 firmer than the previous close. The situation seemed good after the opening, but then the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quoted exchange rate shrank by two-fifths for the British pound and lengthened by two-fifths for the US dollar. After the announcement, the trend hovered. Banks and the gold industry were in disagreement. The trend seemed loose. In the after-market, gold prices fell sharply, and people's hearts worsened. Five points had a great impact.

<h3 id="e258">Call Money Still Quiet, Settlement Extremely Tight <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>丨A Glimpse of the Situation of Large Bank Terminations丨</p>
<p>The semi-annual account closure once a year is the most important juncture for summarizing the entire first half of the year, so the settlement situation of the money industry should have a significant correlation. Observing the situation in the past two days, the procedures were more complicated than usual, but the actual settlement results were indeed dominated by foreign exchange, similar to imported goods, fixed deposits, remittance drafts, etc. As for the import and export of domestic goods, it was negligible, reflecting the lack of market activity. In the market, the call money for both foreign and domestic banks was 8 points in the morning and afternoon, slightly better than the previous day by 1 point. No new swaps were made, and all were settled in cash. The transaction volume of call money tickets was more than 4.5 million in the morning, new transactions were 1.7 to 1.8 million, and the transaction volume in the afternoon was more than 500,000. The transaction volume in the small clearinghouse was more than 700,000. For bank settlements, foreign banks settled more than 3 million in ticket payments, 3.4 to 3.5 million in foreign currency, more than 3.1 million in special payments, more than 2.7 million in settlement payments, more than 3.9 million in foreign currency, and more than 4.4 million in various foreign exchange deposits, remittance fees, and other payments, and 4.3 million in foreign currency. Warehouse entry was 400,000 in silver and 800,000 in foreign currency. Chinese banks settled more than 3.9 million in ticket payments, more than 4.4 million in special payments, more than 4.5 million in various payments, and more than 5 million in various foreign exchange taxes and other payments, and 600,000 in warehouse withdrawal. Japanese banks withdrew 500,000 in silver and 400,000 in foreign currency. Money shops settled more than 44 million in foreign currency public orders, more than 11.3 million in cash transfers, more than 1.1 million in remittance payments from various routes, 200,000 to 300,000 in cash settlements, more than 2.5 million in foreign currency deposit transactions, 2.6 to 2.7 million in banknote inflows and outflows, and 100,000 in customer funds, with very few outflows, only 50,000.

<h3 id="e260">Overview of Public Bond Deliveries in June <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>And the Process of Their Rise and Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for June futures at the Chinese Securities Exchange. Since the merger of the securities section of the Securities and Goods Exchange into the Chinese Exchange on June 1, trading has increased considerably, so the delivery volume was also larger than in May. The process went quite smoothly. The total delivery volume was 29,325,000 yuan. Of this, 18,575,000 yuan was settled through mutual account transfers among brokers, and the delivery volume at the exchange was 10,750,000 yuan. However, the number of deliveries outside the exchange by brokers was impossible to verify, estimated at 15 to 16 million. The largest delivery volume was still in the financial sector. A large bank on the Bund delivered about 6 to 7 million, and a large bank on Sichuan Road received 5 to 6 million. In addition, No. 46 delivered 2 to 3 million, No. 50 received more than 2 million, and other scattered settlements were also quite considerable. Deliverers had already obtained good prices, receivers had ample funds, and scalpers also played a significant role. The price process fluctuated greatly. Tracing back to the initial price of 53 yuan on April 29 after the initial military reduction, the initial price was 42.05 yuan on May 1 after the initial tax consolidation, and the initial price was 38.25 yuan on May 15 after the initial consolidation of six. The highest price was 65.85 yuan on June 23 for military reduction, the highest price was 51.5 yuan for salt tax, and the highest price was 53 yuan on June 20 for the consolidation of six. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was 14.1 yuan for military reduction, 11.2 yuan for salt tax, and 14.75 yuan for the consolidation of six, the largest difference. The process took 59 days. Initially, Tianjin was in imminent danger, and Zhangjiakou was under tight siege. Shanxi also reported failure. May 10 to 15 was the most tense period, with the imminent prospect of impending doom. After this, the voices of peace became more and more prevalent. On May 23, the ceasefire agreement had been agreed upon, and the market price rose sharply. On June 5, the US-China cotton and wheat loan failed to materialize, and the majority rose again to the limit, and the market price had a rapid rise and a steady upward trend. As of June 26, the final market price was slightly lower than the previous highest price by 1 yuan for military reduction, slightly lower by 4 corners for salt tax, and slightly lower by 7 corners for the consolidation of six. The overall strength and steady upward trend can be generally seen. The twists and turns were significant, and new high prices were repeatedly discovered. The 96 public price began to see its peak in trading days from mid-June, and the market price also saw its goodness day by day, and did not rise and fall with the rise and fall of other types. The future seems promising. The total transaction volume of various bonds in June was 292.23 million, an increase of 80 million compared to the number in May. The delivery settlement and transaction volume of various bonds in June are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reports that on Wednesday (the 28th), the New York stock market saw mixed ups and downs. Certain special brewery stocks and railway stocks remained strong and active. Due to the victory of the "wet" faction in California and Sifukini (likely a typo for "Southern California"), railway profit reports were good, and freight volume is expected to continue to improve. The US dollar weakened further. However, because wheat speculators took profits, prices plummeted by five points, causing the stock market to slump. The total trading volume for the day was 5,510,000 shares. According to Steel Age reports, steel production capacity this week increased to 53%, a rate of recovery rare in the industry's history, largely to meet the needs of the automotive industry. However, construction and railways still do not have many orders. If this continues, there are doubts whether the steel industry can continue to increase production. At the same time, due to increased labor costs, the price issue is very uncertain. US cotton fell 20 to 26 points, because the government's weekly cotton production report was better than generally expected, and there were rumors in the market that European countries such as the Netherlands would also abandon the gold standard, so speculators were taking profits. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rose in the afternoon, with market sentiment gradually improving. Current yarn demand is active, and the South China region continues to purchase, so confidence is rising, and shorts are covering. However, large sellers remain firm, and future progress depends on actual sales.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Cotton Futures Market Very Promising <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton futures market was weak due to the decline in US cotton, and market sentiment was scattered. Prices for each month fell by six, eight, and nine tenths of a cent. In the afternoon, it was reported that sales by "Ke Bang" (likely refers to a specific group of merchants) were still smooth, and buying interest increased again. Moreover, trading will stop tomorrow for settlement, and floating traders uniformly covered short positions. Prices for each month rose by one, one and two tenths, two and three tenths, and three and four tenths of a cent. The total trading volume for the day was 31,300 bales. Sold: Dafeng 1,650 bales, Tonghe 1,150 bales, Gengfeng 850 bales, Lichang 800 bales, Dachang 900 bales. Purchased: Liangfeng 1,150 bales, Yuantai 1,750 bales, Changji 1,300 bales, Mingde 1,150 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales are smooth and healthy. Total purchases by various merchant groups throughout the day were 2,612 bales, prices rising 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. Purchases by various groups were as follows: Gengdong 945, Changsha 20, Same trade 860, Yunnan 80, Mainland 652, Xiamen 35, Nanjing 10.</p>
<p>The market for spot cotton for nearby months is quite firm because prices in various producing areas are high, so Japanese merchants are absorbing any declines, and US cotton is also difficult to fall. Buyers' attitudes are strong, and general speculators are bullish on new cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Nearby Month Cotton Rises Nicely <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the Zheng Biao (a cotton trading market) market was mediocre due to the decline in US cotton. Prices for each month fell by one, one and two tenths, two and three tenths of a cent. In the afternoon, news from Reuters reported that the US government had bought two million bales of old cotton for consumer cooperatives. As a result, market sentiment was shaken, and buying enthusiasm soared. Prices for each month rose by two and three tenths of a cent. The total trading volume for the day was 92,800 "dan" (a unit of weight). Sold: Changhe 4,100 dan, Yuanda 2,300 dan, Xinheng 3,100 dan, Yichang 2,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,600 dan, Yifeng 2,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was unremarkable. It weakened initially due to speculators taking profits, then strengthened due to buying by the same trade. In the end, spot cotton fell by 15 points, and futures fell by 15 to 20 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by six "kai" (a unit of currency), and futures fell by 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by six points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to speculators taking profits and brokers selling, then strengthened due to short covering. As a result, Pinggal rose by one and a half "Anna," Karaji fell by half a "rupee," and Bai Khaki fell by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 28th):</p>

<p>| Imported Wheat Declines, Factories Hedge Selling |</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a sharp decline across all months after the opening in the morning. Because the price of imported wheat had fallen significantly, by 1.56 to 1.80 yuan, the feverish speculation was hit hard. Prices for each month weakened immediately after the opening and continued to fall. Sales remained sluggish, and factories continued to hedge sell. In this environment, even though speculation was rampant, it ultimately could not hold firm. By the afternoon opening, the current month was in better shape due to hedging purchases, and outside shorts were gradually covering. However, the long-term months continued to be sold by the factories, and market sentiment softened again. Currently, the peak season for new goods is underway. If actual sales are stagnant, it will be an obstacle to future prospects. As a result, the current month was up by 0.025 yuan, July fell by 0.0175 yuan, August fell by 0.03 yuan, September fell by 0.04 yuan, October fell by 0.035 yuan, and November fell by 0.0325 yuan.</p>

<p>Spot Wheat Arrivals Still Pour In, Transactions Relatively Dull</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a uniform drop across all months after the opening in the morning. The significant drop of 1.568 yuan in imported wheat naturally made people panic. Opening prices fell by 0.03-0.06 yuan. Trading was also very active. At the initial afternoon opening, the near months seemed to improve by 0.02-0.04 yuan due to inward flow from the mainland. However, because the wheat flour market continued to fall, sentiment weakened again, especially for the long-term months. Based on this situation, the future is not promising. As a result, July was slightly better, up 0.02 yuan, August was up 0.01 yuan, September was up 0.02 yuan, October fell 0.03 yuan, and November fell 0.06 yuan. In the spot wheat market, arrivals are still pouring in, but transactions are relatively dull. Because Fuxin stopped operations, the market stabilized. High-quality wheat was stable, while mid- to low-quality wheat was marked down by 0.03-0.05 yuan. Kaijiang North Special High Wheat was 3.80 yuan, lower grade 3.79 yuan, Changzhou Wuyi Wheat 3.80 yuan, Pukou Wheat 3.73 yuan, lower grade 3.70 yuan, Zhenjiang Wheat 3.73 yuan, Yangzhou Wheat 3.7234 yuan, Hezhou Wheat 3.70 yuan, lower grade 3.65 yuan, Liuhe Wheat 3.75 yuan, lower grade 3.73 yuan, Nanjing Wheat 3.80 yuan, lower grade 3.65 yuan, Kunshan Wheat 3.75 yuan, Shuangfeng Wheat 3.66 yuan, Anqing Wheat 3.70 yuan, Qingjiang High Wheat 3.85 yuan. A total of over 14,000 bags were opened, and purchased by Fufeng, Xinda, and Shenda.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 30 sources from various routes. Sales in the street shops were still good, and the market remained stable. The prices of thick Japonica rice and Du Yangjian rice from Changbang (likely a specific merchant group), Su Tongbang (likely a specific merchant group), and Nangang (likely a specific merchant group) varied slightly. The North and South Ocean merchant groups purchased nearly 2,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songxin, Nangang, and other types of rice. Because arrivals were limited, sellers held firm, and the situation followed current market conditions. Prices increased by more than 0.10 yuan. If arrivals remain scarce, there is hope for further increases. Excluding "Bian Yuan" (likely a type of rice) sales were balanced, and prices rose and fell accordingly.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were only 13 or 14 sources from He Xia (likely a geographical location) and other routes. Sales of Bai Japonica rice were sluggish, and the market was stable. Early rice was average. Arrivals of thin rice continued, sales were weak, and prices were soft. Arrivals of Yangjian rice were scarce and sales were active, and prices remained stable. Arrivals of Du Jian high-quality rice were lacking, and mid- to low-quality rice were available. Sales were average, and prices were stable. Prices of Bai Yuan and "Ke Jian" rice rose and fell accordingly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, despite expectations for a decline in bean oil, prices actually rose. Although production costs could be met, there was no profit to be made. Arrivals were scarce, so prices turned upwards. Bean cake weakened due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, Qing Zhong cake fell by 0.04 yuan, and Niuzhuang Black cake fell by 0.01 yuan. The factory market still sold off.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Silk and Tea: Russian Firm Buys Qimen Tea <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>The Russian Assistance Society in Shanghai has recently noticed that Qimen black tea is priced low, which is suitable for the firm's sales. After obtaining the consent of the head office, they began purchasing yesterday. However, most of the goods purchased were mid- to low-grade, priced at 50 to 60 yuan. Moreover, British merchants and foreign firms were not very interested. The black tea market was still not very active. The market for mid-grade green tea from Tunxi, Xi County, and Wuyuan remained stagnant, with sales occurring only as goods arrived. The market for "Zhenmei Zhucha" (a type of green tea) from merchant farms, with the "chouxin" (pluck center) process, gradually looked to increase. Transactions for "Zhenmei" and "Xiumei" grades were also strong. The market for green tea from Yushan, Wenzhou, "Tuzhuang" (likely refers to a specific tea region) and other areas was more active than before, and the situation was quite stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight tightening trend due to increased customs duties and a shrinking Dutch exchange rate. The association set the price for 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 19.95 yuan, with a few transactions. Warehouse rent expires today. Those who immediately sold were at 19.93 yuan. Dutch raw sugar KNG brand was 16.05 yuan, KD brand was 16.00 yuan. Factory market prices: Guanghua Luzi brand new goods opened at 20.50 yuan, old goods at 19.80 yuan. Zhenji Mianbai No. 1 was 19.35 yuan, Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were refunded as before. Chinese goods were priced the same. Dutch raw sugar futures for July, August, and September delivery, opened by Xinyi, totaled 1,000 tons, priced at 3.725 Dutch guilders. A "Chao Bang" (likely refers to a specific merchant group) opened at 60 pieces of barrel-packed "Pianqing" (likely refers to a specific type of sugar), priced at 10.05 yuan, and over 100 bags of high-quality Huanggang "Qing" (likely refers to a specific type of sugar), priced at 13.60 yuan, which was 0.10 yuan higher than before.</p>

<p>Recently, the Garden galvanized wire was being purchased in large quantities by Jiangxi, Henan, and other merchant groups. The atmosphere was good, and confidence rose, so the price was increased by 0.10 yuan, estimated at 5.45 yuan per "dan" (a unit of weight). It is estimated that 600 to 700 "dan" were traded throughout the day. However, there were few spot goods on the market recently, and the future market is likely to remain optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e275">On Imitation <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>According to Aristotle of Greece, the origin of art lies in imitation. If the reverse of that reasoning is true, then the Chinese nation is the most artistic nation. Why? Because the Chinese are the most imitative. We dare not say whether it is imitation in a good sense or imitation in a bad sense.</p>
<p>The secret to the Chinese's talent for imitation is, first, imitating the surface without considering the actual substance. For example, everyone knows the benefits of Western culture, and the Chinese must learn from them. So, anyone and everyone puts on Western suits, leather boots, and picks up a cane, thinking that this is all there is to Western culture. Although eating Western food is an exception, it is relatively more practical. Furthermore, when one mentions the preciousness of science, a group of sycophants throughout the country will come out, empty-headed, shouting loudly, "Science, science, science!" But in reality, what is science, how to promote science, how to apply science, all can be ignored. Although in politics, using deceitful tactics to fight for a bit of status and collect hundreds of thousands of "jie jing" (festival respect) and "tan jing" (coal respect) is a more practical, materialistic and scientific method.</p>
<p>The second secret to the easy success of imitation is imitating other people's bad qualities. It's quite obvious. Just listen to the Chinese language spoken by many Chinese children who have received a Western education and those who eat the church's food and the foreign company's tax, and you can immediately see it. They will ignore other things, but only that strange Chinese language spoken by foreigners, everyone can speak it like a foreigner. The frequent inversion of nouns and verbs, the peculiar intonation, if you close your eyes and don't see the yellow, slanted-eyed, snub-nosed face speaking in front of you, you would believe that it is a foreigner teaching you: "Jesus is the very best person!" If the individual is like this, so is the nation. In the past, they yearned for the cold northern countries, but now some people are enamored with a small country in the hot Southern Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e276">The Heart of Youth <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>In the poem "Autumn Song" (Le chant d'automne) from the collection "Flowers of Evil" (Les fleurs du mal) by the great poet Baudelaire, there are these two lines:</p>
<p>"Like the sun in the Arctic hell, my heart is just a frozen and red ball."</p>
<p>I don't know why Baudelaire had this mood. I am only amazed that these two lines, if used to describe modern Chinese youth, are so appropriate!</p>
<p>People often compare the rising sun to childhood and adolescence, then youth should be the midday sun, and the heart of youth should have boundless light and immeasurable heat. Youths with such hearts should be active, excited, daring to speak, daring to laugh, daring to face reality, and daring to move forward.</p>
<p>However, in China, such youths have not been seen for many years. The hearts of Chinese youths have long lost their light and heat, becoming a frozen and red ball.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of people who blame the youth for their depression and concealment, but they do not look at the Arctic hell that surrounds the youth. Ice mountains, white and terrifying ice mountains, are on the east side, the south side, the west side, and the north side, surrounding them on all sides, with no way out. Even if there are brave men who call on their comrades to open up a path to life, as soon as they speak, they are suffocated by the piercing wind, and as soon as they take a step, they are swallowed up by the snow pit and destroyed one after another.</p>
<p>So, the youth cannot speak, cannot move.</p>
<p>So, the hearts of the youth become frozen and red balls.</p>
<p>However, it is still the heart of youth. So, it can still be red.</p>

<p>Ding Ling has disappeared, but her "Mother" has been published. Every reader who reads this "posthumous work" (?) will, I think, feel an unnamed sorrow, and at the same time sincerely pray that this female writer will one day return unharmed.</p>
<p>"Mother," it is said, is part of a very grand creative plan, originally intended to write from her mother's era to her own era. "Mother" is written about her mother's era, the Xinhai Revolution era.</p>
<p>However, I believe that the description of the era of "Mother" is not very clear. That is to say, the author's description of the era of the Xinhai Revolution is too vague, too impersonal. This may be due to: (1) the author was not originally from the era of the Xinhai Revolution, and she did not have rich practical life experience of that era; (2) the author's family was originally a "big household." This "big household" is increasingly declining, or the author has heard too much about the decline of this big household from her own mother, so when writing, she will unconsciously harbor a sentimental mood, making more reminiscences of the "Kaiyuan Prosperous Times" (Tang Dynasty) and descriptions of the situation of this declining big household, and cannot actually grasp that era, to draw a clear outline for the movements and changes of that era.</p>
<p>You see, in the 289 pages of the entire book, she spends almost half of the space to describe the declining situation of this "big household" (Jiang family), and in the other half of the space, she constantly recalls the past prosperity of another "big household" (Yu family). She describes the declining situation of the Jiang family and the desolate situation of the orphaned widow very detailed. She also describes the sincere and loyal old family member ("Yao Ma") in great detail. She describes the situation of the Ding family, even the great aunt, second aunt, third aunt, etc. of the Ding family, in great detail. Even Du Shuzhen, who does not occupy an important position in the whole story, is described in great detail. Almost all of these descriptions use the techniques of "Dream of the Red Chamber" to carefully depict, or it can be said to be deliberately imitating "Dream of the Red Chamber." Especially the description of the third young mistress of the Yu family is obviously a replica of Wang Xifeng, and that great nephew's young mistress is obviously a substitute for Granny Liu. In short, she uses "detailed writing" for all these, but for the turmoil and changes of that era, she uses "large writing". It's just a few rough strokes, it's just a faint shadow.</p>
<p>"The world is really different, Yunqing is also different... but his teaching is different from his father's teaching in those days. He doesn't teach people to write articles, but only teaches students how to improve the country, talking about what civil rights are, what a republic is, all are new and strange things."</p>
<p>"What do you understand? Now it's another faction, and the articles have changed."</p>
<p>This is the author's description of this turbulent era, how vague this description is! Also, that is, women (like Mr. Jin and the like) unbound their feet, men (like Yunqing and the like) cut off their long ponytails, that is, the young mistresses and misses sat in sedan chairs and took their old mothers and maids to the newly opened girls' schools. Although it was also mentioned about the Opium War, the Eight-Nation Alliance, and the expulsion of the Manchus, it was only "mentioned", and did not write about the impact that the strong political and economic aggression gave to China, this agricultural country, after the imperialists broke through China's gates, nor did they write about the impact that the Manchurian government's incompetence and tyranny gave to the Chinese masses. Why expel the Manchus? Why reform? Why revolution? These were not explained, so the author's description of the turbulent era before the Xinhai Revolution is obviously "not enough".</p>
<p>Especially the description of the Xinhai Revolution, this great movement, is even more "not enough", even simpler. The explanation of the Xinhai Revolution is only the ghostly panic of the girls' school, only "fearing that the revolutionaries are going to start something, some say in Nanjing, some say in Guangdong, some say in Hankou..." only that night, something really happened, on the side of the examination shed, probably a burst of scattered gunfire came from there... the next day, the streets were quiet and no one dared to open the door. The magistrate had already fled last night. A few soldiers died and some ran away. The rest surrendered. Some ruffians also died. A few old gentlemen who did not shave their heads maintained order in the city, and there were a few young gentlemen with cut hair mixed in, probably the revolutionaries." The author explained the Xinhai Revolution in such an evasive way, as if it was just an accidental storm, not a fully brewed sudden change, as if this "storm" was only unique to Wuling, not a widespread and universal movement. Can such "large writing" give the reader a clear outline of that era? Of course, this attempt has completely failed.</p>
<p>This is just a rough criticism, no, a little thought after reading. There are many other places that seem to have room for discussion, but limited by space, I will have to leave it for later.</p>
<h3 id="e278">The Theory that Nearsightedness is Not a Disease <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Nearsightedness is becoming increasingly serious recently, and I am quite saddened by my inability to obtain the "Ai Dai" (a type of rare bird) from the Malacca Kingdom. My wife laughed and said: "In this world, nearsightedness is good. Farsightedness is not good." It was a joke, but it had some thought. The Biography of Hermits in the History of the Later Han Dynasty records that Jianwei was appointed to Ren Yong, and Feng Xin of Zitong, both claiming to have glaucoma to avoid the troubles of the world. Yong's wife was adulterous in front, but he concealed the truth and said nothing. Seeing that Yu (the author) had fallen into the well, he endured and did not save him. Xin's maid also had an affair with Xin. When the Shu Rebellion was roughly pacified, they all washed and looked again, saying, "The world is now peaceful, and our eyes are clear." Also, Ruan Ji's Biography in the History of Jin Dynasty says that Ji could show different eyes, giving a "white eye" to those who emphasized rituals and customs. The ancients either soiled themselves with glaucoma or showed contempt with white eyes. Why should I be worried about nearsightedness? The first chapter of "Jin Ping Mei" records that Ximen Qing and Bai LaiGuang, Chang Zhijie, and ten others went to the Jade Emperor Temple to become sworn brothers. Looking around the temple, he caught sight of the Four Marshals, Ma, Zhao, Wen, and Huang. Bai LaiGuang's comments on Marshal Ma's three eyes were also illogical.</p>
<p>Bai LaiGuang held Chang Zhijie's hand and looked over from the left. When he came to Marshal Ma, he saw that the Marshal Ma was majestic and dignified, with three eyes painted above. Then he called Chang Zhijie and said, "Brother, what does this mean? In today's world, it's good to open one eye and close one eye. Is it okay to have an extra eye to see people's flaws!" Ying Bojue heard it and came over and said, "Stupid brother, isn't it good for him to see you with more eyes?" Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>The ancients have said, "It is unlucky to be able to see fish in deep water," let alone see people's flaws! "In today's world, it's good to open one eye and close one eye." This is the subtle meaning of the author of "Jin Ping Mei" in the opening chapter. Although I am nearsighted, I am still better than those who are "眇" (one-eyed) who "open one eye and close one eye." Nearsightedness, nearsightedness, why should it be a disease?</p>

<p>He could never resist putting both hands in his pockets. As soon as he saw the Lepic family approaching, he hurriedly took them out, but it was already too late. One day, she got angry and sewed his sleeves shut, hands and all.</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>"No matter what, you shouldn't lie," his godfather, Mr. Wehrodi, told him. "It's a very bad habit, and what's the use of lying? Everything will always be exposed."</p>
<p>"True," Carrot Top Hair replied, "but we can get through some time."</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>The lazy older brother, Felix, barely graduated from school.</p>
<p>He stretched his limbs and sighed comfortably.</p>
<p>"What do you like?" Mrs. Lepic asked him. "You've reached the age to choose a profession. What do you want to do later?" "What! Here it comes again!" said the older brother, Felix.</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>Everyone was playing harmless games (jeux innocents).</p>
<p>Miss Palte was being questioned:</p>
<p>"It's because she has blue eyes," said Carrot Top Hair.</p>
<p>Everyone exclaimed:</p>
<p>"That's wonderful! What a charming poet!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Carrot Top Hair replied, "I didn't even look at her eyes. I said this the same way I say other things. It's a form of habit, a rhetorical figure."</p>
<p>Eleven</p>
<p>When playing snowball fights, Carrot Top Hair stood alone. Because he hid stones in the snowballs, everyone was afraid of him, and his power was great.</p>
<p>He aimed at people's heads and threw: it was quicker that way.</p>
<p>The water was freezing, and while others were skating, he was on the grassy area next door, building another small skating rink.</p>
<p>When playing leapfrog, he was always the one squatting down, letting people leap over his back.</p>
<p>When doing gymnastics, he also let people do whatever they wanted, without regard for his freedom.</p>
<p>When playing hide-and-seek, he hid so well that people forgot about him.</p>
<p>Twelve</p>
<p>The children were measuring their height.</p>
<p>At a glance, the older brother, Felix, who was not in the competition, was a head taller than everyone else. But Carrot Top Hair had to stand side by side with his sister, Elestin, even though she was just a girl. When Elestin tiptoed to make herself taller, Carrot Top Hair, not wanting to displease anyone, secretly lowered himself a little, so that the difference would be slightly larger.</p>
<p>Thirteen</p>
<p>Carrot Top Hair gave the maid Agatha this advice:</p>
<p>"If you want to please Mrs. Lepic, you should say bad things about me in front of her."</p>
<p>But there was a limit to this.</p>
<p>Except for herself, the Lepic family did not allow others to violate Carrot Top Hair.</p>
<p>When a neighboring woman was threatening Carrot Top Hair without permission, the Lepic family rushed over, angrily rescued her son, who already had a face full of gratitude.</p>
<p>"Now, let's settle the score between the two of us!" she said to him instead.</p>

<h3 id="e280">On Excretion <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Eating big meals, eating pancakes, drinking ginseng soup, drinking tap water, no matter how you eat, no matter how you drink, you have to excrete. This is probably not a problem at all, right? However, the same excretion has different ways of excreting. On this point, I can give many obvious examples.</p>
<p>Speaking of which: Once, I was at the home of a pastor in a small county, and I saw a foreigner shitting. He used a long piece of foreign lead pipe from the bottom of the toilet on the second floor directly to the floor below. Of course, there were many benefits. First, the shitter would not smell his own shit. Second, it could save him from going downstairs. At that time, I thought foreigners were really smart and could come up with such ingenious methods. Later, I realized that the flush toilet in the city was no different from that. However, it was a pity that the small county did not have the large construction of tap water, so a Chinese servant had to carry a bucket of spring water and wait in front of the toilet door. After the foreigner had a big shit, he would pour it down, clean and perfect.</p>
<p>Another time, I heard that there was a young wealthy man named Wang who was very particular about his daily life. When shitting, he had to spread a stack of jade-like Xuan paper on the floor, with his maid serving by his side. Every time he dropped a piece, she would immediately wrap it up and throw it away. This method was of course no less clever than that of the foreigner. Although the shitter was indeed human, and the shit wrapper was also among humans, humanism was no longer as valuable as it used to be. The above two examples are just novelties in small counties and don't amount to much. But once you get to Shanghai, it's very different. Flush toilets can be said to be very common. Anyone who can afford fifty yuan in rent almost has this blessing. As for large hotels, large theaters, and other public places, the excretion facilities are even more magnificent. As soon as you enter the toilet, someone immediately comes forward to serve you. After washing your hands with scented soap, you can adjust your tie and comb your hair in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>However, this is only limited to the special circumstances of the upper class, while the deeply sinful masses of the lower class often suffer for excretion. Many hardworking men, in order to save the two dimes a month for emptying the toilet, and because buying a toilet also costs more than a dollar, have to take advantage of the fact that no one is watching and hide behind the billboards in the open space to relieve themselves. But unfortunately, they encounter the "three-strike patrol". If they don't have time to roll up their pants and escape, they will be taken away after a burst of wooden sticks. The fine is five dollars, or imprisonment for three days. The laws are strict and will not be tolerated. There are also those who usually think that the place where it is forbidden to urinate is the place to urinate, and boldly unleash a torrent from afar. But sometimes fate is unkind, and they will encounter a landlord with a straight face, who will of course scold them and really "send them to the authorities for prosecution without leniency." There are also many country women carrying Longdi Li or chicken eggs who, when there is no other way, have to disregard their womanhood and learn from men to relieve themselves a few times. As for the female workers in the factory, they are a little different. They really want to sneak off to the toilet to take a nap, even though there is a stench that the young ladies can't imagine, but for the sake of rest, they don't need to bring perfume with them.</p>
<p>Because urination and defecation are so inconvenient, excretion has become a source of national wealth. It is said that Hankou once had an official called the "Director of Manure and Urine Bureau", who was fairly appointed through bidding. The income of those who obtained this position was no less than that of the Director of the Opium Prohibition Bureau. However, this was in the past. After the revolution, everything was reformed. Now it is a peaceful and prosperous world, and of course there will be no such smelly business. However, has the government's income not been greatly reduced? This requires a copy of the government gazette.</p>
<h3 id="e281">A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Residential Areas <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Kuang</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a gentleman with the pen name Mr. Wu published a long article in this publication about living quarters, which was quite humorous and profound, prompting me to write this article. But I do not presume to ride on his coattails, and have no delusions of matching his work.</p>
<p>Secondly, because after flipping through a thick Shanghai Guide, I found that the analysis of residential areas was missing and not detailed, which is truly a pity. This makes me want to "supplement it with this", and at least hope that "those who have a Shanghai Guide at home" will consider it for reference.</p>
<p>According to my observation and research, the distribution of residents in Shanghai can be roughly divided into the following areas:</p>
<p>(1) Capitalist District: This area is located in the British Concession, from the Bund westward to Zhao Feng Park on Route Petain. Taking Xizang Road as the boundary, the area to the east can be said to be the capital of capitalists and the place for making money. Large banks, large companies, and large hotels are all concentrated in this area. The number one scenery on the road is grasshopper-like cars and ant-like men in suits. To the west of Xizang Road, such as Jing'an Temple Road, Seymour Road, and Yuyuan Road, is the capital of capitalists, that is, the place where they feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. Western-style houses, villas, gardens, movie theaters, and dance halls are the most outstanding.</p>
<p>(2) Poor People's District: This can be divided into the following two small districts:</p>
<p>(a) Cotton Mill Workers' District: Yangshupu and Xiaoshadu are the main bases. Almost all of Shanghai's cotton mills are concentrated in these two places. Hunchbacked, semi-modern girls and dried-up underage girls swarm like tides in the early morning or evening, and are the only decorations on the road.</p>
<p>(b) Rickshaw Pullers' District: Rickshaw pullers, wheelbarrow pullers, flatbed pullers, and cart pullers mostly live in Zhabei. They shed blood and sweat all day long, but are always hungry, and are directly and indirectly exploited by capitalists. Their bones and blood have created the prosperity of the capitalist district.</p>
<p>(3) Middle Class District: According to my observation, the middle class does not have a fixed area in Shanghai. Perhaps this is because Shanghai has become extremely capitalist. They mostly live in the above two districts, and are interspersed with the poor. In addition, there are several other districts:</p>
<p>(a) Politicians' District: This is in the French Concession. The residences of presidents of parliament, the mansions of ministers, and all kinds of things are here. Fourth- and fifth-class small politicians also rent houses here. If the political situation changes, we can see people who run around like street vendors on some roads in the French Concession. Their political arguments are all for the country and the people, and they are willing to jump into the fire pit themselves.</p>
<p>(b) Remnants of the Old Dynasty District: The pigtails are still reluctant to be cut off, dragged behind their shoulders, or coiled on top of their heads. Such as licentiates and scholars mostly gather in the "quite ancient" Nanshi. Although they are not used to riding in foreign cars, they each have a semi-foreign chartered car. Occasionally, they stroll to bustling areas, such as Nanjing Road, only to shake their heads.</p>
<p>(c) Students' District: This can also be said to be the edge area of Shanghai, from Xujiahui to Fanwangdu, to Jiangwan, to the end of Yangshupu. Several famous universities in Shanghai are in these places. Western-dressed students come and go in the central urban area like carp crossing the river, and are like shuttles weaving cloth. The car business is very good.</p>
<p>(4) Prostitute District: This also refers to the French Concession, such as Dongxinqiao, Xixinqiao, and the vegetable market street behind the Great World, are their activity areas. Late at night, if a fool passes through this area, even if he is spared from being dragged in, he will be frightened and at a loss.</p>
<p>(5) Opium, Gambling, and Loafer District: Also in the French Concession. If you go to the street corner, you can see loafers fighting at any time. Some small hotels can be said to be disguised opium dens. Gambling dens are also everywhere, and gamblers naturally gather in this district.</p>
<p>In conclusion: Shanghai is the general area of Chinese culture and economy, and also the general area of crime and disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Sent to Song, Separated by Walls <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>Song,</p>
<p>This letter is the seventh time I've communicated with you. Since you left, your sister has only eaten half a bowl of white rice in two days. She is crying and facing me all day long, wanting me to bring you back. Because your sister cannot live without you, she lives only for you. Today is the third day since you left. She is still not eating or sleeping well, her complexion is sallow and withered. She also lies down during the day and cannot sleep at night. If this continues, the landlord downstairs will easily issue an eviction order.</p>
<p>For the sake of Miss Ye, you resolutely left your beloved sister and me, who is most loyal to you, without saying goodbye. We used to be close and intimate, but once we turned against each other, we became cold and enemies. I have sent you six letters in a few days, but you have not replied. Even though I asked someone to deliver them to you, do you think it's not worth it? In the past, when you came back from school, you often told me things like: Miss So-and-so is so fashionable, so beautiful, Miss So-and-so has many boyfriends, Miss So-and-so likes to watch movies and eat: : :. At that time, I often nodded reluctantly a few times. Afterwards, I slowly persuaded you and told you not to be obsessed with love and go astray. You just smiled and thought that I was praying and couldn't get into your ears. However, although I couldn't force you to listen to me, I honestly taught you like I was teaching you. At that time, I knew you hated me very much, but I didn't keep silent because you hated me. Therefore, I willingly accepted your hatred, hoping that you would repent and change your ways, but the reality was contrary to my hope.</p>
<p>You are now only seventeen years old. If things go wrong, you can still be forgiven. You shouldn't have suddenly left your young sister, because she can't stand on her own.</p>
<p>Moreover, since you met Miss Ye, many of your classmates have criticized you. But apart from the two who hang out with you all day long, who can even be called friends; I have been trying my best to defend you, refute the rumors, and do propaganda. I believe that your knowledge and insights are rich, and that you will not act beyond the scope; therefore, I do not hesitate to expend a lot of effort and become your most loyal defender. But when you came back from school last Sunday, your attitude suddenly changed, and you blamed your beloved sister for no reason. When I spoke to you, you were a little resistant, and then you started cursing. I really don't understand what you mean by doing this; maybe you are deliberately retaliating against me. However, my heart is not made of wood or stone after all, and it only beat wildly for a while at that time.</p>
<p>Afterwards, you practiced a policy of silence towards me. No matter how I tried to persuade you and apologize, you always ignored me. So I lost the trust of your classmates; because your actions unfortunately proved them right. Alas!</p>
<p>Finally, I realized that you had won Miss Ye's favor, and therefore became arrogant. Moreover, you became more and more intimate with those two close friends, as if you had obtained a talisman; because both of them are eager to pursue women!</p>
<p>In the past, you also said that I was jealous and preventing your freedom. In fact, this is just because women are binding you; she can drive your capable heart towards depravity. What is there to be jealous of? Because you think I am obstructing you, you have not returned home once in several days; you are so cruel as to ignore your sister, making her weep all day long as if she had lost something. Ah! You are too cruel.</p>
<p>Song! You must know that this is not ordinary clamor, nor is it intentional insult to you. I hope you will forgive me and realize that what I am saying is right. Get rid of all your temptations and come back to see your beloved and young sister right away! June 27th</p>

<p>— Xia Yi</p>
<p>"Let's make it this day!" My father pointed to a line of small characters on the perpetual calendar. This was a standard almanac for determining auspicious days that my father brought from home after a night and a day on the train. This was a book that our government had decided to ban absolutely after deciding to switch to the Gregorian calendar. However, in the Shanghai concession under imperialist rule, people would start shouting and selling "Gregorian-Lunar Calendar Comparison, can't buy it anywhere else!" on the streets every November! The book in my father's hand was just like that.</p>
<p>"Whatever: : :" I couldn't add any other opinion. I have read books for fifteen years, and have also wandered east, west, north, and south for three years. Speaking of age, I am not young. But now, I still have to ask my father for seven or eight hundred yuan a year to spend in Shanghai as a bookworm. I am too embarrassed to suggest any ideas. If I want to be respectable and regard myself as an aspiring, progressive, revolutionary, modern youth, I would say "Let's talk about it in a few years, it's not time to talk about it now." What I mean is, after I become economically independent in a few years. That would be terrible! How many years or decades will it take to become economically independent, enough to build a modern small family? I really don't dare to think about it!</p>
<p>One of my older brothers graduated from university and has been working as an electrical engineer in Shanghai for three years, earning a thousand yuan a year. But after paying for rent, food, clothing, entertainment, etc. every month, his bank savings book always has only five yuan and a few cents in interest, and he never deposits another yuan. He said, "To get married, you have to win the grand prize in the Great Champagne lottery: a woman's pair of silk stockings costs twenty-five yuan." Naturally, women are not easy to deal with, with Paris perfume, high-heeled shoes, and long cheongsams. But how many Chinese women spend twenty-five yuan to buy a pair of silk stockings? How do those writing room clerks who earn twenty yuan a month support a family? If you want to blame someone, you can only blame higher education for ruining people!</p>
<p>As for me, I am considered a spoiled child, and I can't ask for much more. Since it is my father's intention, it is like the school bell has rung. I can only tuck the book under my arm and walk slowly into the classroom. The time of a bookworm is easy to pass. What book is tucked under my arm, and what am I doing in the classroom? Let me tell you slowly!</p>
<h3 id="e284">More News about the "Graduation Examination" <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Graduation Examination this year, after the unfortunate incident of the test questions being leaked, has caused a lot of criticism from all sides. Some say that there is no need to continue the examination, and some say that the whole thing should be invalid. I believe that cheating is one thing, and the continuation of the examination is another. If the officials who are suspected of cheating are transferred to the court for investigation, then the truth of the matter will come out, and the issue of the continued examination will also be held on the 24th. Although there are still some students who oppose participating, it can be said that it has basically come to an end. Therefore, I will describe what I have heard about the continued examination as follows.</p>
<p>Personally Drafting Questions</p>
<p>During the examination, the test questions for each subject were drafted by outsiders hired by the Examination Committee, with at least two people drafting questions for each subject. Then, the chairman of the committee would gather and select the questions, and then hand them over to a certain printing house in Nanjing to proofread and print. They would be sent to Shanghai one day before the examination to avoid accidents. It cannot be said that the handling was not cautious. However, due to the cheating of officials who did not know how to cherish themselves, there was no good result. Therefore, for the continued examination questions, the chairman of the committee personally drafted them, ordered the staff to print them, closed the room, and opened the lock the next morning. Then, he distributed them to the chief examiners and rushed to each location, which was truly careful.</p>
<p>Perseverance</p>
<p>It was also heard that Mr. Zhang Yuanchun was the proctor for the Nanyang Advanced Business School during the continued examination. Mr. Zhang arrived at the school on time, but there was not a single student. He asked the principal for the school register, investigated the addresses, and then ordered the school servants to drive the Freedom Army at full speed to inform each student individually. It was not until 5:00 p.m. that five students from the junior high school department came to the school. Then, the examination began. His spirit of perseverance to achieve the purpose of the continued examination can be said to be unusual. One of the five students said that he had already found a job, but the qualification for the future must be at least junior high school. He urgently hoped that the continued examination would allow him to obtain a graduation certificate. If so, the ability to handle affairs will be judged based on talent and knowledge, but the qualification issue is indeed somewhat related.</p>
<p>Proportional Extra Points</p>
<p>According to related people, the answer sheets for each subject are being corrected, and the standards are too different. They had no choice but to use the proportional extra points method. For example, if the score is above 30 points, add 25 points. If the score is above 50 points, add 10 points. In this way, everyone can pass. Even those who have already passed will be given some extra points at the discretion of the examiner. It is really impossible to help and all they can do is sigh.</p>
<p>Last Chance</p>
<p>After the continued examination, the list of successful candidates will be published in the near future. However, those who did not participate due to illness will have a make-up examination as originally planned. It is heard that students who did not participate in the continued examination will still be able to participate in the make-up examination. If so, there is still a last chance. Those who still insist on not participating, just because they failed one or two subjects, should consider the issue of further education.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a junior high school graduate who wanted to be a shop clerk but didn't get to be one. There are two brothers in our family. My older brother, at the age of fourteen, was recommended by my father to a certain soybean and wheat shop in this port to be an apprentice. At that time, he had just graduated from elementary school. After three years of training, he can actually write and calculate. Now his monthly income is about one hundred and twenty or thirty yuan, which is enough to meet the needs of his small family. As for me! In the year I graduated from elementary school, my father happened to have a slightly larger income, and my older brother was already independent, so he decided to send me to junior high school to continue my studies. Time flies like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, three years have passed and I have graduated. I want to continue my studies, but my father doesn't have much money, so I have to ask someone to find me a job. I always thought that having read three more years of books, it would be easier to find a job. Little did I know that the opposite was true. Many elders shook their heads and frowned in unison: saying that it is most difficult for junior high school graduates to find a way out. If I go to an old shop to be an apprentice, nine out of ten times I will not be able to endure the hardship and drop out halfway. If I go to a large organization to be a small clerk, my knowledge and experience will not be enough to cope. So until now, it has been two years and ten months, and I still can't find a way in. Alas, whether one can endure hardship or not is different for each person. I believe in myself, I can endure hardship. As for knowledge and experience, of course they are superficial, but how can it be said that junior high school graduates who have read three more years of books are not as good as elementary school graduates! Therefore, every time I hear my father sigh and say "I regret letting him read three more years of books," a strange emotion arises in my heart: Is this really right? Sir, please give me detailed instructions! Please</p>
<p>Yours respectfully, Shen Gantang</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Postscript: This matter seems very illogical, but after actual investigation, it is a very common contradiction. The reason why Mr. Shen can't find a job as easily as his older brother is largely due to the fact that the economic situation of society is different from what it used to be. But the fact that junior high school graduates are not welcomed by society is also a fact. The shortcomings of the attitude of the social people towards junior high school graduates have been explained very thoroughly in Mr. Shen's letter. However, the knowledge given to students by three years of junior high school education is mostly outweighed by the arrogance gained in these three years. It cannot be said that there are no exceptions, but it can generally not be denied. Therefore, the elimination of this contradiction requires the joint efforts of three parties. (1) Those in charge of junior high school education should pay attention to this point, so that students can adapt to the environment after graduation. (2) Junior high school students should also give up their arrogance and know that a junior high school graduate is not worth much. They should work with humility, be able to endure hardship, and be willing to learn. (3) Social people should also know that young people are the vitality of the country, and they cannot generalize based on the few unpromising junior high school graduates they have encountered in the past. They should know that people's characters are different, and they might as well give them a chance to try. It is impossible to shirk the responsibility of promoting the younger generation.</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>"Committee Member Chen is out." The messenger threw the contemptuous words like a book at him and closed the door. Although his heart felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted, his face blushed red alone. After hesitating for a moment, he dejectedly walked back the way he came. In the two years of his unemployment, being turned away was commonplace, but the current situation should be somewhat different: during the war with Japan, his own compatriots should be more amicable than usual, right? What need was there to put on airs of importance? Moreover, moreover, he felt hungry again, and touched the only three meal tickets in his pocket. Only Chen Tianren had promised him money to start a magazine: the concept of patriotism began to clash with his stomach: but no matter what, he had to be patient. He consoled and comforted himself with the thought that many important people, before they gained recognition, had to go through this painful stage. After reflecting on this, he prepared to try again this afternoon.</p>
<p>On the way, he bought a copy of the Shen Bao newspaper to read, and he suddenly became happy. Wasn't it true? The news of Zhang Honglie and others organizing the Volunteer Army was published, but Zhou Shaoping's name was missing. Why? Wasn't he the earliest initiator and the most hardworking member? This was ultimately a small matter. As long as the Volunteer Army was indeed established, he would have a share of the credit. He went to find Zhang Honglie, but Zhang Honglie and the others had all gathered at Longhua. It was already eleven o'clock, and his stomach was so hungry that he could no longer bear it. He had no choice but to drag his feet to a restaurant to eat. In the restaurant, he saw several old classmates. At first, they inevitably talked enthusiastically about the war, but when they talked about each other's own affairs, they couldn't help but fall silent.</p>
<p>"How's it going!" One asked with great concern.</p>
<p>"Still the same!" Young people would all answer like this. Even though they had been loyal to each other as classmates, and maybe even had factional disputes, at this moment, a feeling of being scattered and displaced arose, and they couldn't help but feel gloomy and sad.</p>
<p>"I'm planning to start a magazine, and I'd like you all to help me out," Shi Qiao often liked to be self-possessed, always trying to show that he had more tricks up his sleeve than others in his poverty and despair.</p>
<p>"As long as there's money, I'll definitely come!" Wang Hua said bluntly. "But have you found backing yet? And you need to find backing that advocates resisting Japan before they'll put up the money."</p>
<p>Shi Qiao felt that Wang Hua looked down on him too much, but secretly he also admired Wang Hua's sharp eye. But Liu Zhengzhong shook his head and said:</p>
<p>"But how will you write? What effect can it have?"</p>
<p>"Fool! Just speak from the position of the backer, and the effect is: Haha!" Wang Hua was known by everyone as an optimist. His wife lived in a small attic room, eating porridge every day, but he never considered it a shameful thing and never hid it from others.</p>
<p>Shi Qiao didn't completely agree with Wang Hua's words. He believed that running a magazine wasn't that meaningless. If it was run well, and if they spoke fairly, it would certainly be beneficial to the country and society. But everyone knew that Wang Hua was indeed a capable person, and it wasn't appropriate to completely dismiss his words. He couldn't help but invite Wang Hua to his house in the evening to discuss it in detail. After saying goodbye to everyone, he regained his courage and walked towards Chen Tianren's residence.</p>
