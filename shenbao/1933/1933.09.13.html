<h3 id="c63">英美日三國之海軍軍縮會議　　實 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>丨丨華府倫敦會議以後世界軍縮之最大關鍵丨丨</p>
<p>日本借充實軍備之名。實行擴張海軍。美國亦急起直追。在一九三六年之前。依產業復興計劃。將建造三十九隻軍艦。在倫敦條約所允許及美國財力所可能下。盡量補充。英國鑒於日本之突飛猛進。美國之急起直追。深感遠東利益之受威脅。澳洲印度之不安。乃亦起而競爭。擬每处年建造優秀巡洋艦十五隻。自此以往。匪特太平洋上不得太平。且恐延及於印度洋方面。世界將益</p>
<p>多故矣。</p>
<p>日本自挑起瀋陽事變。强奪我東三省而後。雖以「焦土外交」。爲抵制國際合作之工具。然而世界經濟會失敗後經濟聯盟盛行繼以海軍競賽以外强中乾之日本。詎能長期對抗此海軍兩巨敵。故重新召集三海軍强國會議之消息。遂自日本發出也。目前倫敦條約。將屆满期。在此英美日三國積極準備海軍競賽之時。此種會議恐不易召集。即召集亦恐將陷於經濟會議之故轍。惟今日之世界經濟恐慌。併未過去。英日兩國。亦不能顧及其國力。是以海軍軍縮會議。或仍有召集之可能。設使此三强會議而果成事實。必於以下三個問題。須先有切實適當之解决。否則第二次世界大戰將愈迫近欲緩和而不可得矣。</p>
<p>第一。爲東北四省問題。在日本一般人受其軍國主義者以武力爲上帝之麻醉。以爲「满洲」已造就旣成事實。决不讓中國收回亦不許列國過問然而遠東市塲。開發殆盡。黃河流域之文明。勢成過去。揚子江之富庶。亦現枯渴。印度澳洲。皆屬於大英帝國之範圍。則未來之有望市塲惟東三省而已矣。今乃爲日本所强占。我中國固不甘服。即英美各國。亦豈願終於退讓耶故三强</p>
<p>會議之核心。太平洋爭。霸之標的。皆在於此。設使此東北四省問題而不得適當解决者。匪特該地爲世界火藥庫。時時有爆發之虞。且潛伏於遠東之百年禍根。將長演歷史之悲劇。亦未可知也。</p>
<p>第二印度洋之防禦與澳洲之安全。驟然觀之。其形勢似萬不及太平洋風雲之緊急。且英日政治關係。接近之可能性甚多需國間容易轉圜。然須知英人之經營遠東。以我國揚子江流域爲前哨。香港爲第一線而新嘉坡爲第二線。印度則爲其本據。頃者日帝國突飛發展已將東北四省收入其囊橐中經濟勢力。已越新嘉坡而。侵入印度。此後軍事目標將由陸軍轉而爲海軍。自大陸移注於海洋。通過日本代管之南洋羣島。馬拉林。加洛林。而指向澳州與新西蘭矣。以故英國於此。早已準備新嘉坡築港。以防護其東方寳庫之印度。添建新艦以固澳洲。此則英日間攻防之對立。殊不易於和緩者也。　　第三。太平洋上之軍事防禦。與軍備競爭。就一方面觀察。洵爲日美兩國爭霸之故。蓋華盛頓會議當時。以五·五·三海軍比率。日美關係。幾至破裂。倫敦條約。僅主力艦尙維持五與三之比率。輕重巡洋艦驅逐艦之類。幾爲十與七之比。而潛水艇則英。美。日。爲平均比率。然英美皆艇齡老大。速度遲緩。故事實上日本之潛水艇。已駕英美而上之。菲利濱與關島。以華盛頓條約關係。曾中止軍港之設備。一旦有事。難免不爲日本之囊中物。此爲美國所深慮者。設使三强會議果成。美國在東方海軍根據地之軍事設備。必然成爲日美爭論之中心。况日本軍部。近正努力提倡打破華府與倫敦兩條約之海軍制限。以擴充日本之海軍。如是則不但菲利濱不安。即檀香山亦不免震動。是亦爲難以解决之問題也。　　以上三者爲英。美。日三國對立關係之基點。在爭鬥期中。將日美衝突乎。日英衝突乎。抑英日聯合以制美。英美聯合以制日乎。據現勢推測。英日衝突。似不可免。且英美聯合之可能性。已大過於英日同盟矣。</p>

<p>（東京）　荒木陸軍主張樹立國策、前向藏相提示之具體案、涉及國際關係國内關係、頗爲廣訉、藏相一一加以研究、近將更與陸相會見二三次、同時陸相將與齋藤首相各閣員及民間有力者會見、說明目下之國情、促全國的奮起、尤以陸相此學、表示軍部所懹抱國策之一端、同時表示陸軍對政局之態度、從來盛傅陸軍持反對政黨之態度、歡迎超然内閣、目下陸軍則不向超然内閣或政黨内閣、苟能實行掃除社會不安原因之政策、即歡迎之、由此見地、置國策樹立爲第一義、遂迫現内閣實行、齋藤内閣是否容納、此爲重大之試金石、而及於今後政局之影響亦極重大、齋藤内閣究以如何態度應付、極堪注目、（十二日電通電）</p>

<p>日以英美比擬虎狼</p>
<p>太平洋戰禍迫眉睫</p>
<p>據名古屋新聞載稱、自美國發表龐大海軍建艦計畫後、英國亦步武美國、實行充實補助艦艇、其他法意二國、亦受重大刺激、蓋各國均照一九三五年第二次華盛頓會議條約所定量數内、力謀擴充、據四日内倫敦達於日外務省之情報稱、美國海軍省之增艦計費、爲（一）建造優勢巡洋艦二十九隻、（二）每年建造驅逐艦十五隻至十八隻、（三）擴充艦隊所屬航空機械、（四）增加人員一萬、（五）增加艦燃料練習費、此等擴張案、定於次年度提出預算、其大建艦隊之用意如何、雖未明瞭、然其目的所指、不難推測、即（一）英國在華盛頓倫敦條約内與美國有同一比率、過去世界經濟會議、英與美之利益相反、故项國不得不决意加建軍艦、（二）未來之第二次華盛頓會議時、保留有力的發言權、萬一會議决裂、不得不有充分之準備、（三）英在世界、有廣大殖民地、爲謀保護與殖民地的連絡、（四）通商貿易關係、英國最近與日本愈形惡化、預防與日本衝突、同時極力擁護大英帝國經濟同盟、以壓迫日本、至於美國、在一九三四年度、（即本年七月一日起、至明年六月三十日止、）其實行總預算達四億六百萬元、實爲華盛頓會議以後、最巨額的軍費、其中（一）新艦建造預算四三·九一０·七八五元、由產業復興費中支出四六·０００·０００元、計八九·九一０·七八五元、（二）艦艇改造費、預算五·五００·０００元、由產業復興費中支出三０·０００·０００元、計三五·五００·０００元、（三）飛機建築費、預算八·一００·０００元、（四）水陸設備費、預算一·九四六·九五０元、（五）其他雜項、預算二六四·０二九·一九０元、以上四五兩項、節减四千七百萬元、一方由產業復興费費中、支出八千四百萬元、二三四五各項、合計三億一千六百萬元、合之第一項、共計四億五千九百餘萬元、</p>
<p>我國（日本）亦以一九三五年軍縮會議、爲期已迫、力謀兵備之充實與装備之改善、蓋自满洲事變以來、帝國對於四國之情勢、逐漸緊迫、除昭和八九十三年度充實装備外、並爲謀制度之改善、在可能的實現方針之下、積極準備關於充實準備之主務、即（一）在昭和八九十三年度之資料準備、製造新兵器、費用爲三億五千萬元、（二）昭和八九二年度以千五百三十八萬元爲操作敎育費、（即令將校以下對於新兵器之操作運用爲目的、）目下對於將校、在步兵學校·騎兵學校·野戰砲兵學校·工兵學校·各飛行學校·汽車學校·等實施練習、對於下士官兵、則在各聯隊授以補助敎育、主要新兵器之配備與充實、大體如下、（一）步兵方面、機關槍之装備、新式步兵砲之採用、（聯隊砲及中隊砲等、）（二）騎兵方面、各師騎兵聯隊装備機關槍、與旅團騎兵之配屬機關槍隊於各聯隊、（三）砲兵野砲聯隊、增設輕溜彈砲、更新各火砲之式制、增設高射砲及照空隊、（四）工兵電報聯隊中、充實甲中隊、（五）輜重兵充實機械輜重、（六）其他如新設車載步兵·自動車砲兵·車載工兵·自動車通信兵·重戰車·等機動兵團研究機關、施設研究測量氣象等、以及改良無線通信敎育等、</p>
<p>同日并發表社論略云、美國海軍之大補充計畫、與英國之大建艦計畫、對於日本却有前門拒虎後門迎狼之感、何則、美國之增造三十七隻艦艇、與英國之增造艦艇五十隻、其目標原爲對日戰備而起、因美國自倫敦會議以來、直至今日、與論方面本不贊成建艦費之支出、不圖最近大變態度、朝野上下、一致支持提案、惟藉失業救濟產業復興爲名、發表建艦計畫、實爲不解、蓋救濟失業、端賴生產、今反耗巨額之國帑、而爲不生產的建艦、大與失業救濟之本旨相悖戾、又日前倫敦方面傳出消息、謂日本超越條約制限、秘密製造大量潛水艦各部分品、保管於横須賀·吳·兩軍港、此等部分品、不費數日、即可配成完全的軍艦、此種消息、不知何自而來、可見英美之蹂躪國際信義、蔑視條約神聖（此爲日本推已度人之語）之事實、已難諱飾、目前日本對於英美之無信義、不過單就道德的外交、以爲對抗、惟虎與狼、已迫近日本之前後門、自不坐視其建艦之競爭、故我國（日本）財政雖極困難、但爲鞏固國防起見、亦不得不樹立要本方針也、</p>

<h3 id="c203">盜賊 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>「賊」與「盜」，自然都不是「安分良民」，但尙還有些高下。在中國，似乎賊的地位高得多。做賊，似乎是値得使人贊許的。例如我們蘇州的唐解元伯先生，一生專幹「竊玉偷番」的勾當，到現在，還有這多的彌詞大家，撥動冰絃，在無線電播音台上「一笑」，「二笑」的說個不已。士夫們。對於人家的骨董字畫，垂涎三尺，而苦於無法到手，於是「三十六着，偷爲上着」，卽使「人賊並獲」，也不失爲强賊風度」。孫猴子偷吃蟠桃，人參果。更是千古流芳，萬古不朽。可</p>
<p>知「偷」，並非「不齒」的，所以溥大執政，實行「竊國」，將來還怕受不到封「候」御典麽？</p>
<p>但是洋貴子總究不濟，趕不上我們中國的「斯文一脈」，偷偷摸摸的勾當，而專幹殺人越貨的强盜買賣。他們所認爲最有英雄氣槪的，便是「海盜」。不拘在小說裏，在影片裏，海盜越是殺人不眨眼，越受人崇拜。陸上的「馬賊」，也是萬流景仰的。所以「臨城刦車」，能使各國人士，</p>
<p>嚇一大跳，而大鵬灣的海盜，更使洋貴子「具有戒心」，而不敢再小覬中國人都是竄偷狗竊的一大堆膿包，其中也還有不少「英雄好漢」。所以梁山泊裏，一向被人所看爲「跳梁小醜」的一百零八條好漢，若有人装满了肚子没事幹，倒不妨譯成外國文，流傳到各國，那非但可得大利，简直可使「重盜輕賊」的洋貴子們，以後不敢再用正眼睄俺中國人。</p>
<p>不過不拘在中國人面前做「賊」，或在外國人面前做「盜」，都要做「自已識相。做賊，不可不「風流文雅」，或是「胆大妄爲」。做盜，更不可不幹到「騎刦商輪」，或「佔據山頭」的程度。若是偷竊短衫褲，路刦金絲　，一旦捉將官裏去，雖經若干時期，得解放性慾一次，可是「鐡窗高臥」，到底不是當要的。</p>
<h3 id="c204">中國遍地是黃金 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 涂紅霞</p>
<p>幾百年前，意大利有個敎士利瑪竇，到中國來傳敎，歸去的時候，爲使彼邦人士明瞭中國情形起見，特地做了一本書，名字呌做東方見問錄，裏面描寫中國的一切，尤其是有一點，說得非常的引人注意，褒：『中國遍地是黃金與珠寳』。遂致引動歐西的人士，羣來中國，以看究竟。這當然是令人失望的一件事。</p>
<p>不料，最近，這句話居然實現了，你看到處都可發財，航空券，香檳票，這是發大財的機會，吸香烟而剩下來的空壳，可以換奬券，得元寳，拿洋鈿，用肥皂剩下來的包紙，空盒，也可以換奬券，得洋鈿，····</p>
<p>由此以觀，發財心重的人們，本來每天吸一盒香烟的，現在爲使多有發財機會起見，於是大吸而特吸，兩會，三盒，···的逐漸增加··用肥皂的朋友，同樣的快用快買快換券快得彩，所以公司裏的股東，一個個笑得眉飛色舞，嘴都合不攏來。</p>
<p>本來是的，錢，誰都喜歡的？在中國，的確遍地是黃金，隨處都可發財，一個窮措大，不費吹灰之力，就可成爲豪富。</p>
<p>利瑪竇先生，謝謝你的預言，已經成爲事實。然而，這是不是好的現象？當然自有一番大道理在，用不着小子多話，就此停筆不寫了。</p>
<h3 id="c205">接吻 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>兩性戀愛熱度到了最高點的時候，因爲求性的慰藉，就繼之以接吻　　在戀愛的舞臺上，接吻是不可逃避的一幕戲劇，但是照衛生家看起來，兩性間接吻，雖然可以得到愛的慰藉，若是某方有傳染病，如梅毒，麻瘋，肺癆等類，唇與唇接觸之間，雖然能享到愛的</p>
<p>權利，但是也要嘗受沾染病菌的義務，所以接吻這個名詞，多麽香艷夠味，若是反過來一看，有利也有害的！</p>
<p>人與人的接吻是直接，人與物接吻就是</p>
<p>間接，夏天的蒼蠅，我們知道他是極污穢的，他的身段蹲在食物上，纔涎留在菜肴裏，我們設不防備、啖吃這種食品</p>
<p>，的確，與蠅類接吻没有分别，疾病傳染，生命喪失，這一吻的代價，眞是令人可驚可駭丨夏天滅蠅，人類視爲最急切不可稍緩的一種重要工作，凡是婦女，小孩，誰都明白這個道理，人與蠅接吻，眞是一件可怕的事！　　另外社會上有一件人不經意的事，就是被人們閱過的視爲廢物的舊報紙，人們因爲研究廢物利用，就將他充爲包銅元，糊板壁之用，但是有一種開吃食店的老閭，他委實神經過敏，却取來充爲包裏食物之用，報紙上的字跡，所用的油墨，有知識的人們，誰都知道含有毒</p>
<p>質，只能用眼看，不能用嘴吃，現在因包取食物，人們的嘴，竟能間接與他作親近的接吻，這種害處，和食蠅類的口涎，是没有分别的！</p>
<p>就以上數點觀之，人與人接吻，是香艷的，是夠味的，猶不免含有危險的事實！人與物接吻，旣非自願，又是無形，所得的害處，眞是唖子夢見媽，說不出來苦丨禍從口入，我們在平時對於起居飲食，却要特别注意，不能大意着與危險物類的吻痕，作間接的接觸的。</p>
<h3 id="c206">凡是與一定 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>

<p>第十五回　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑</p>
<p>人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>桂枝本是没有什麽話可說的，可是看到趙自强這種受窘的樣子，不安慰他兩句，又怕這個老實人，會起了别的疑心，便道；你不用說了，這些事我全知道。長耳朶不是聽事的，長眼睛不是看事的嗎？說畢，他又嘆嘆一聲的笑了。趙自强見他說話，已經能帶玩笑的意思，彷彿是熟的多了，便笑道：請你不必客氣，要吃什麽，就吃什麽罷。桂枝默然了一會，依然還是站起來，有要走的樣子。趙自强用手摸摸頭，笑道：家裏有什麽要緊的事嗎？桂枝沉吟了一會子，才笑道：雖没有什麽要緊的事。可是我出來太久，我媽要問的。他一面說着，已是向外走出去了。趙自强覺得他那個樣子，也並不是非走不可的，無奈自已不會餾客，所以把人家放走了。眼看桂枝走去，心裏未免怏怏，於是也就情不自禁的，由桂枝身後跟了來。一直跟到了櫃房裏來，桂枝才回過頭來，站住向他連連的揮手道：别送了，别送了！他說這話時，眉頭還有些皺，自然這是不甚願意的表示。趙自强也很會意，就不向走了。他回得雅座來，付了點心錢，一頭高與，走回家去，由院子裏經過時，那皮鞋踏着地磚得得作嚮。就十足地表示他已經是很得意了。他一隻手揭着帽子，一隻手掀了棉布簾子走將進來，就呌着爸爸向趙翁行了個鞠躬禮。趙翁見他臉上笑嘻嘻的，便低聲笑道：你得着了什麽消息了嗎？趙自强没說話，先忍不住要笑，就點點頭道：大槪没什麽問題了。趙翁在腰帶上，取下掛着的煙袋來。點上</p>

<p>— 郭秋申</p>
<p>母親想雞吃。於是今天珞從小菜塲裏回來，菜籃裏放着一隻花黃的母雞，雞是買來了，但無殺雞之人，珞同母親都很膽小，拿起刀來竟會發抖，阿媽連殺魚都不動手，據伊說生來脚板底下從不踏死一個螞蟻，何况殺雞大事，因此這兇手，就推到我身上來，「天有好生之德，人有惻隱之心。」我當不難他們，所以「君子之欲遠疱廚」吧。</p>
<p>我捲起兩隻袖子，一手拿定了刀，一手把雞的雙翅，兩腿，連雞的頭統統握住一起，拔去了些雞頸的羽毛，剛想把刀加上，一眼看瞥見珞抱着麟在我的身旁，當然我喚珞把麟抱開，爲了這小小潔凈的心靈，不欲使他種下這殘忍行爲的印象。</p>
<p>眼看白刀子進，紅刀子出，雞血汨汨地流，片刻的功夫，已緊閉了兩眼，於是放下桶去，兩腿伸了幾伸，唱出些微最後掙扎的哀鳴，已結束了牠的生命。　　本來殺雞是椿小事，算得什麽殘忍行爲？白天裏，在這繁華的都市，人殺人是常見的事，而且我們中國人，尤其是像隻小雞，任别人們的宰割！</p>
<p>我們是永久被人宰割的嗎！</p>

<h3 id="c209">家用皂與香皂之製法 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>肥皂爲日用必需之品，約分家用皂與香皂一種，茲將其製造方法，詳述於後，以供關心實業者之參考焉。</p>
<p>家用皂所用之原料，如牛油，柏油，棉子油，豆油，木油，蓖麻油，椰子油，純碱，石灰，等等。先將各種油類配合，溶於地缸，再用帮浦（Ｐｕｍｐ）打入酸性缸内，加以硫酸，隔六小時，提去污物及水份，以待應用。另取石灰與水，溶化於碱化缸中，將上項提凈之油，漸漸放入碱化缸中，用泗汀姆（Ｓｔｅａｍ）加熱之，至乳漿狀爲止。翌日卽成石灰肥皂。將石灰皂經搗碎磨粉機運送機升上機貯於不蛭式淋筒内用高度熱水侵濕之，待十二小時，放出，名曰甜水，其味甚甘！注入蒸發缸内，揮發其水份，然後經過淋機，卽成粗製甘油，可供他種工業用品。將淋筒内提去甜水之石灰皂，用搬運機陸續搬人皂鍋，同時加入純碱，用泗汀姆加熱，經十二小時，再加納綠使皂與石灰分離，上浮者卽肥皂，下沉者卽灰泥將灰泥放出，存於地池，用水提去灰泥中的有含之碱液，的剩之灰泥，烘乾後卽成粗製炭酸鈣，可供工業用品，將提去之碱液，與松香，用泗汀姆加熱而成松香肥皂。將松香肥皂與皂鍋内肥皂混合，經十二小時，遂成純粹肥皂。乃用帮浦打入皂機存貯待用，臨用時將皂機中之皂注入攪拌機，加入香料，用冷氣帮浦打入軋皂冷却機内，經半小時，凝在大塊，然後取出，用裁皂機裁成</p>
<p>小塊，卽成家用皂矣。</p>
<p>香皂之油類，與家用皂稍有不同，大抵以牛油，椰子油，芘蔴油，爲主。其製不亦如上述，製家用皂相同，惟另用一鍋燒煮。待其肥皂旣成之後，亦注入軋皂冷却機凝結成塊，然後切成長條形，分條擱置坡璃眞空房漂白之，經數月之久，俟其凈白，臨用時移人盤旋装置之乾燥室，室之上部有鑤片機，取凈白之長條皂，放入鏍片機内，鑤成鱗片，由艦旋装置撒布於室内數層之銅絲烘燥之，約一二小時，移入一定量之肥皂攪拌機，和入香料及顏料，啟輪攪拌之，约一小時移入磨研機，如是反復數回，俟香顏料非常混和，乃移入盤旋推出機，其</p>
<p>内部如一螺旋之軸，肥皂由螺旋捲出，其出品可以更換各式模型，則欲製圓方形等均可。</p>
<p>自推出機推出之長條，用分隔器切成小塊，然後移入打印車打印，置淺木格子内，移入另一眞空乾燥室内，乾燥後約一星期之久，遂成香</p>
<p>皂矣。</p>
<p>記者按：以上所述，乃係格來别次氏間接製皂法，國人經營之五洲固本皂廠，卽係採用此法製造，其出品成績甚優！無庸贅述。惟年來洋貨與劣貨肥皂、濫造削價，力圖傾銷，此實國貨前途之隱患也！</p>

<p>計盲童學校一所聾唖學校四所</p>
<p>均係小學創辦初中感師資缺乏</p>
<p>盲唖敎育爲特殊敎育之一種、佔全國人口千分之一盲唖者之中國、實有積極發展之必要、敎育部有鑒於此、近特訓令各省市敎育廳局調查全國盲唖敎育槪况、以爲研究之參考、而謀發展之圖徑、上海對於大中小學敎育無不有畸形發展之現象、而注意於此項特殊敎育者、尙屬無幾記者爲欲明瞭本市盲唖敎育之狀况起見、昨特分頭往本市各盲學校調查、茲將調查所得、分誌如次、俾供關心盲敎育者之參考、</p>
<p>盲童學校一所　本市盲童學校原有兩所、一爲羣學會附設者、創辦於一二八前、學生僅有三人、辦理一學期後、以一二八事起、遂致中輟、迄今仍未復辦、一爲英人創辦者、設於憶定盤路、校長傅蘭亞、學生人數極少、校務並不發達、</p>
<p>上海聾唖學校　該校爲本學期所新創辦者、校址設西門肇嘉路、校董陳鶴琴·張壽鏞·歐元懹等、校長孫昱森、現有敎員五人、學生七十五人、爲本市最有生氣之聾唖學校、記者昨日前往、由該校敎員施殿淸君、領導參觀、學生宿舍整潔異常、敎室有初高級各一、各種統計圖表頗爲周詳、由孫君指導學生向記者表現發音手切等頗饒與趣、中有學生孫克潤、曾在烟台聾唖校訓練三年、本學期轉入該校、說話已如常人、該生向記者宣讀該校章程、口齒頗淸𥇦、誠爲難得、</p>
<p>羣學會附設者　中華路羣學會附設之聾唖學校、創辦於民國九年四月、是時華人創辦之聾唖學校僅此一所、市敎局每月補𦔳經費�</p>
<p>百元、楊聘漁爲校長、上學期有學生九十人、本學期已减至二十七人、敎員共有三人、該校前曾創辦初中職業科、現已停辦、畢業學生七人、有擔任聾唖校敎師者、有擔任打字者、均能服務社會、</p>
<p>外人所創辦者　此外尙有兩所、一爲極司非而路傅蘭亞聾唖學校、英國人設立、創辦於十五年九月、校長傅蘭亞、現有學生五十五人、另有一所爲徐家匯聖母院附設之聾唖學校、法國天主敎會設立、校長斐姆姆、現有學生二十七人、創辦於民國紀元前九年、爲本市聾唖學校之歷史最悠久者、</p>
<p>聾唖一般調查　全國聾唖學校除上海四所外、尙有烟台·北平·南通·南京·蘇州·杭州·鎭江等共計十餘所、學生人數約四百人、全國聾唖人數雖無確實統計、但據一般估計、每千人中佔據一人、共有四十萬人之多、其聾唖原因、直接遺傳者百分之六十、間接遣傳者百分之二十四、血族結婚者百分之十二、學語時有耳病者百分之四云、</p>
<p>師資頗感缺乏　據上海聾唖學校施君語記者、目前中國聾唖敎育之不能發展、第一是學校經費之缺乏、第二是師資之缺乏、而後者較前者更爲切要、往昔中國僅烟台聾唖學校曾創辦師範一班、其餘各地尙無所聞、故聾唖學校在中國僅有小學、初中以上之職業科殊難創辦、此點深望敎界有以注意及之云、</p>

<h3 id="c235">秋夜漫談 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 虞明</p>
<p>八月三十日的夜裏、遠遠近近，都突然劈劈拍拍起來，一時不及細想，以爲「抵抗」又開頭了，不久就明白了那是放爆竹，這才定了决心。接着又想：大約又是什麽節氣了罷？···待到第二天報紙，知道原來昨夜是月蝕，那些劈劈拍拍，就是我們的同胞，異胞（我們雖然大家自稱爲黃帝子孫、但蚩尤的子孫想必也未嘗死絕，所以謂之「異胞」），要將月亮從天狗嘴裏救出。</p>
<p>再前幾天，夜裏也很熱閙。街頭巷尾，處處擺着桌子，一有麵食，西瓜上面叮着蒼蠅，靑蟲，蚊子之類。還有一桌和尙，口中念念有詞：「迴猪玀普米呀吽！唵呀吽！吽！」這是在放𦦨口，施餓鬼。到了孟蘭盆節了，餓鬼和非餓鬼，都從陰間跑出，來看上海這大世面，善男信女們就在這時盡地主之誼、託和尙「唵呀吽」的彈出幾粒白米去，請牠們都飽飽的喫一通。</p>
<p>我是一個俗人，向來不大注意什麽天上和陰間的，但每當這些時，却也不能不感到我們的還在人間的同胞們和異胞們的思慮之高超和妥帖。别的不必說，就在這不到兩整年中，大則四省，小則九島，都已變了旗色了，不但救不勝救，卽使想要救能罷，於勢也有所未能。所以最妥當是救月亮，那怕爆竹放得震天價嚮、天狗决不至於來咬，月亮裏的酋長（假如有酋長的話）也不會出來禁止的。救人也一樣，兵災，旱災，蝗災···災民們不計其數，幸而暫免於災殃的小民，又怎麽能有一個救法？那自然遠不如救魂靈，事省功多，和大人先生的打醮造塔同其功德。這就是所謂「人無遠慮，必有近憂；而君子務其大者遠者」，亦此之謂也。</p>
<p>而况「庖人雖不治庖，尸祝不越尊爼而代之」，也是古賢的明訓，國事有治國者在，小民是</p>
<p>用不着吵閙的。不過歷來的聖帝明王，可又並不卑視小民，倒給與了更高超的自由和權利，就是聽你專門去救宇宙和魂靈。這是太平的根基，從古至今，相沿不廢，將來想必也不至於</p>
<p>便廢。記得那是去年的事了，滬戰初停，日兵漸漸的走上兵船和退進營房裏面去，有一夜也是這麽的劈劈拍拍起來，時候還在「長期抵抗」中，日本人又不明白我們的國粹，以爲又是十幾路軍前來收復失地了琥，立刻放哨，出兵···亂烘烘閙了一通，才知道我們是在救月亮，他們是在見鬼。「哦哦！成程（Ｎａｔｕｂｏｔｏ）原來如此」！驚歎和佩服之餘，於是恢復了平和的原狀。今年呢，連哨也没有放，大約是已被中國的精神文明感化了。</p>
<h3 id="c236">「我所見的世界」 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>我住在一處在層樓上，窗門正對着ＸＸ醫院。凭窗俯視，最先入眼的是這醫院中的一排低矮的瓦背的建築，原來就是太平間。我素來膽小，畏見與「死」有關的一切事物。在鄉下的時候，棺材，墳墓，不消說是最使我卻走的了，即如送殯的儀仗，祀祖的祠廟，也常使我心惴惴。不料這回的卜居，偏偏着落在這與常常出没着死亡的處所近在咫尺的處所。起初的幾天，我很憂慮，我憂慮我的心將不得寗靜了。</p>
<p>然而可怪的是，事情並不如我所料。我在這里住满一個月了，而我對於這死亡的逆旅，未嘗發生過些微的不安。我每天凭窗，每次見到那一排低矮的瓦背的建築，而且常常看見從這建築中，運出失了呼吸的人體。然而我不曾有過一點恐懼，我還樂於每天凭窗眺望，取得對於我的疲勞的安慰。</p>
<p>這事情是可怪的，但我知道牠的來由　是不是醫院方面有意爲之？他們在太平間的後面栽了一列樹木，又在樹木後面打了一道籬笆，這樣的使那黑色的小屋和我所住的房子相隔。那些樹，我不知道牠的名目，葉茂，幹細，然而頗高，高過我所住的三層樓，所以很苗條，如一個細腰的摩登女子，一有微風，她們就欵擺起來，蕭蕭有聲，我疑心牠們就是白楊丨即使不是白楊，我也願意認牠們爲白楊，因爲，這是很富於詩意的。</p>
<p>詩意，確乎是不淺的。這是一列白楊之類的樹，恰當我的窗前，作成一幅綠色的簾子，從隙處望去，有古雅的黑瓦的屋背和屋背上的神秘的白色十字架，有對面的紅牆，頭上的靑天·····。</p>
<p>這一切，雖不曾使我吟成什麽詩章，然而確乎使我目怡神適，如對自然的風景。至少，那構成風景之一的黑色的小屋，對我完全失了太平間的意義，即使常看到屍首運出的，我也只把她看作風景的點輟品而已。</p>
<p>這是一種奇蹟：把恐懼悲慘的境界化成美麗莊嚴的塲面。但我知道這是那一列樹木的「遮眼法。」</p>
<p>是不是醫院方面有意爲之？但無論怎樣，這一列樹木對於我知先乎我後乎我的住在這三層樓上的房客，總是一種大的恩物，是使我們於可怖的境界中得到怡樂的法寳。對栽種這些樹的醫院，我是十分感謝的。　　我所感謝的還不止此，我還感謝他們給我一個偉大的敎訓，使我知道人間的一切苦難，都可以藉「遮眼法」而解脫。天災，人禍，國難重重，而國民還是熙熙如登春台者，實在並不能怪他們没有熱血，而是遮眼的事物太多之故。地火在地底運行，但只要上面還長著野草，就會使人忘掉爆發的危險的。</p>
<p>然而，有被遮住眼的人，有自已製造遮眼物的人，還有索性閉了眼的人···。　　各樣的人，各有「我所見的世界。」而眞實的客觀的世界，遂被無視。</p>
<p>這里所引用的「我所見的世界」一語，是Ｅｍｉｌ　Ｌｕｄｗｊｇ去年發表的一本書名·我有着這書的法譯本，其中有這樣的一節論耳與目的話：</p>
<p>「耳是婦人，當她聽取的時候，是被動的。眼是男子，當他觀看的時候，是能自主的。因此，當眼不願意看的時候，他會用自然的方法：閉起來。耳若不願意聽，則有待人爲的方法，（兩手來掩。）」　　這話是極確的。當我的目光，專注於</p>
<p>美麗的「風景」，無視了太平間的時候，我的耳朶却不能拒絕從太平間襲來的悲痛的哭聲的闖入。每當夜深人靜的時候，那白楊之類的樹葉的蕭蕭，也常常引起我對於死的恐怖和哀愁。</p>
<p>在眼睛被遮之後，苦於還有聴覺，使我們約略知道眞實的世界的情况。</p>
<p>雖然我也有兩手，可是不知爲什麽，我總没有勇氣舉起來掩住兩耳。</p>
<h3 id="c237">再論馬致遠 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>鄭振鐸先生在九日的自由談上寫了一篇「馬致遠雜劇」，認爲我在七月所作的「馬致遠雜劇的胚胎」有兩點錯誤：（一）馬氏的四支小令不一定是作在雜劇之前：因此也就不一定是雜劇的胚胎。（二）「孟浩然踏雪尋梅」非馬致遠作。我很高興，他給了我這個機會，使我能夠對於我的臆測有所申說。</p>
<p>第一點，我仍舊維持我的原意，以爲小令在前，雜劇在後。理由有二：（一）四塊玉潯陽江一首與白居易琵琶行無甚出入。潯陽江云：</p>
<p>送客時，秋江冷，商女琵琶腸斷聲。可知　　司馬和愁聽。月又明，酒又醒，客乍醒。　　這一首曲那是採取「琶琵行」的原意。「琶琵行」原詩云。</p>
<p>潯陽江頭夜送客，樹葉荻花秋瑟瑟。···</p>
<p>··轉軸撥絃兩三聲，···别有憂情闠恨生。···惟見江以秋月白，····江州司馬靑衫濕。</p>
<p>可見當時馬致遠還不曾有什麽文人幻構的想像，只是採取詩意爲曲而已。到了他寫「靑衫涙」時可就不然了，他放開了手憑空添了許多戀愛</p>
<p>的情節來，完全逸出了原詩的範圍。倘若馬致遠先寫這樣任意想像或借酒澆愁無中生有的「靑衫涙」，似乎不會再寫那樣拘謹的「潯陽江」江</p>
<p>了吧。至於小令簡短，足夠發展雜劇，那倒是次要的。（二）倘若「潯陽江」是作在「靑衫涙」之前，那末其餘兩首四塊玉必都作在「靑衫涙」之前，因爲在「太平樂府」裏，這三首挨肩放在一處的，並且同以地名爲題，（天台路，紫芝路）當爲同時的作品。並且，這三首都是四塊玉，都是馬致遠所寫過的雜劇的故事，所以我便不能不引起懷疑和推測了。此外鄭先生所說，元人小令咏陳博和孟浩然，元明人小令歌詠崔張故事，不是馬致遠和王寳甫戱劇的胚胎；也只是增加語勢而已，實際上我不曾說過他人的小令是馬致遠雜劇的胚胎，並無用此種排比的必要。</p>
<p>第二點，我在鄭編中國文學史面八七二上也見過他像這樣說：「息機子雜劇選中又載他的孟浩然踏雪尋梅一本，但那是明周憲王之作，並非他所寫的。」最近他在自由談上又說：「我們在錄鬼簿太和正音譜諸最古的記載上，都找</p>
<p>不到馬氏劇目裏有所謂踏雪尋梅一劇。」但我</p>
<p>查古書流通處所影印的「太和正音譜」上册頁一二行六，「羣英所編雜劇」馬致遠條下，就有「踏雪尋梅」這個劇名。（元曲選卷首與梁廷枬曲話俱引之）六藝書局的曲苑本鍾嗣成錄思簿頁九也有踏雪尋梅。鑑賞週刋第十期（一九二五年八月）陳乃乾的曲錄校補云：「或謂孟浩然踏雪尋梅，應據也是園書目歸之元馬致遠。惟元明人雜劇名目同者甚多，或略加潤飾，或翻改情節，卽如誠齊樂府之曲江池，元石君實亦有之，名同而關目實不同也。」他說「關目實不同」就是承認馬氏另有同寫此事的劇本。同例，馬</p>
<p>致遠的「劉阮誤入桃源洞」第四折收尾（北詞廣正譜太和正音譜所載）在王子一的「劉晨阮肇誤入桃源」裏就找不到。我想，倘若息機子所選的踏雪尋梅與周憲王的完全相同，那末，大約馬氏的是遺佚了，所以息機子纔在看了錄思簿太和正音譜等書後來了一個張冠李戴，倒不見得是什麽熟讀小令」。王國維在踏雪尋梅條下明說：「「太和正音譜」有此本。」我想這或者是鄭先生一時疏忽的錯誤。太和正音譜錄馬致遠雜劇僅十三種，還連「踏雪尋梅」在内。曲錄把合作的「黃梁夢」除去，加上「風雪騎驢孟浩然」和（「任風子」也只得十四種。鄭先生在中國文學史上說馬氏雜劇有「十四本」，（面八六九）倘若不把「踏雪尋梅」算在内，恐怕凑不满這個數目吧？</p>

<p>在屋内的薄暗的光中，他看見在一張竹床上，在一條寛大的紅木棉被下，仰臥着一個婦人。他靜靜地臥着，好像死人一樣；但是她的大眼睛，開張着，閃在黑暗中，眼神靜止而什麽也看不見似地，凝視着房上的樑木。她發着極高的熱度，顯然是没有意識了。雙頰稍稍陷落下去，她的唇半開着，而且在這個年輕的面孔上露出兇險的死般的表情丨丨一個將死的人的無意旘的沈思而茫然的表情。這兩個男人默默地俯視着她。</p>
<p>「他病了好久了麽？」那個旅客問。</p>
<p>「我已經有五夜没有睡覺了，」那個馬來人語氣沈着地回答。「最初她聽見水裏有聲音招呼她，我抱住她，她在我的身裏掙扎着。但是從今天早晨起，她再聽不見什麽了丨丨連我的聲音也聽不見了。她再着不見什麽了。連我丨丨連我也看不見了！」</p>
<p>他靜默了一會兒，於是輕輕地問：　　「屠安，她會死的麽？」</p>
<p>「說不定吧，」那個白人悲鬰地說。他和阿薩特相識已有許多年了　，在一個遠遠的國度，在一個危險而粉擾的時期，那時任何友誼都是可珍貴的。其後他的馬來友人就出乎意料之外的同着一個奇異的婦人住在這個淺湖的小屋裏，他在路過這條河流的旅程中，他來這裡住過許多次。他很喜歡這個土人，因爲他是知道怎樣保持言語的信義，而且知道怎樣站在他的白種的友人的身邊毫無懼怕地鬥戰。他喜愛他，也許像一個人喜愛他的心愛的狗一樣，但他仍然能夠給他以援𦔳而毫無希求地喜愛他，甚至在他自已忽忙的事業中，他都會茫然地想到那受�</p>
<p>着恐怖而孤獨地同隠在森林中的這個寂莫的人以及那長頭髮的，容貌傲慢的，長着兩雙勝利的眼睛的婦人。</p>
<p>那個白人走出小屋來，這時他正好看見在樹梢间昇起了一片黑色的動蕩的雲霧似地，那迅速地偷偷前來的陰影，展開在在空上，使浮雲的深紅和那日終的紅光稀薄了，而且消滅了落日的巨大的火熖。過了一會兒功夫，在大地的濃厚的黑暗上，顯出了繁星，於是這淺湖，映着星光渾閃着，像是一塊投入了絕望的陰慘的黑夜的荒郊裏的橢圓形的夜空。那個白夫從籃子裏取出一些晚餐的食物，並聚集一些散在臺子上的樹枝，燃起一堆小火，這不爲的是取煖，而是想籍着那煙氣，趕走蚊子。他用毯子裏住了自已的身子，靠着房屋的蘆葦牆坐在那里，沉思地吸着煙。</p>
<p>阿薩特從門口走出來，絲毫没有脚步聲，蹲坐在火旁。那個白人動一動他伸出伸出的腿。</p>
<p>「她在喘氣，」阿薩特小聲地說。「她在喘氣而且像是被大火燒着似的。她不說話，也不聽話，只是火燒！」</p>
<p>他停了會兒，又靜靜地淡然地問：　　「屠安···她會死麽？」</p>
<p>那個白人不安地動着他的肩，像是猶豫的樣子囁嚅着：</p>
<p>「如果她的命運是那樣的話。」</p>
<p>「不，屠安，」阿薩特冷靜地說。「如果我的命運是那樣的話。我聽着，我看着，我等着候着。我記得···屠安，你還記得從前的時候麽？你還記得我的哥哥麽？」</p>

<p>在以前、每晚上像僵屍般的躺满了乞丐的過街樓下，是怪黝暗而令人可怕的，今晚却不然了，那見的電炬，照耀得比白書還亮，我這「老而不死是爲賊」</p>
<p>」的老頭兒，實在給它弄得眼睛掙不開，除了發光亮的電燈外，還有一個台，據說等一會兒要做甚麽「難黃」了。這「灘黃」二字對我是怪生疏的。什麽，在一年前，我在「岙裏頭」還不曾到這所謂十里洋塲的上海來，袛有聽見過什麽上海「黃浦灘」有「外國銅洋人」丨丨這是有名的「洋大人」的遺像。「灘黃」是我有生以來，第一次入耳的新名詞。心裏想，這台旣是搭在「過街樓下，」必定是可以免費看看的。爲了好奇心的驅使，竟忍心拖長了頭頸等着，等着見識這我們鄉下没有而是道地的十里洋塲的上海的文明。</p>
<p>時針和分針一度一度地過去，分針已指在十二時上了。我的老花眼實似渴</p>
<p>睡，但是想起怪新鮮的「灘黃」新名詞來，又使我淸醒振作許多。就在這辰光</p>
<p>，很快的就看見有一男一女登上台來表演了。聽了許久，除了聽來聽去都是些關係「男女」的事與我們鄉下人絕對禁止上嘴的話以外，一些也没有什麽。呵···原來所謂「灘黃」不過是這麽一回事。我倒不敢再領敎了。心裏又想，大家出了錢呌這些不像戲子又不像各尙的傢伙來演這樣「下流」的把戲，爲的是甚麽？　　跑到家門口，就聽見大孫女在吵着也要出去看那邊正做得熱閙的「灘黃」。媳婦說···「女孩子家怎好看這種「灘黃」。那是下流坯子看的。」這些話我都聽在耳朶裏，我一聲不響，心裏覺得，她是好媳婦，倒也知道這「灘黃」是不値一看的而去禁止着她的女兒，這眞是家門有幸了。我拖着一個同弄堂的朋友，我就問他；「那面爲着什魔麽事，怎樣熱閙。」「是七月蘭盆勝會打太平醮呀；因爲現」</p>
<p>在活着的太「窮」了死去的當然也很「窮」。所以當七月裏餓鬼放出地獄的時候，是很需要大家捐些錢去買鍚箔，燒成些「銀子」給他們的：現在是在做戲給鬼看。」呵！原來就是打醮，這倒使我想起昨天像惡呌化子般的一夥人到我家來捐錢的情形了，我因爲他們名正言須的話把我的頭閙疼了，所以也送了他們一個「中山頭」丨這就是我老頭子汗血的代價呀·誰知他們是拿來閙些這種把戲的。上海地方眞容易「上當」呀！我眞不明白，難道這樣一閙，死鬼就可以得福就以受「超度」了嗎？眞是，這年頭兒人不如鬼·像我這老頭兒，一天仍然要牛馬似的從來没聽說過有誰要來給的些福，或是說來救濟：鬼倒還有一般菩薩心腸的慈悲士們肯來「超度」　們·眞是，這年頭兒，我們這流汗淌血的勞苦的一羣，是没有誰來「超度」「賜救」的，我們所聽得到的，所遇得着的，祗有加重的壓榨和担負·但是啊，我們便甘心了麽？</p>

<p>丨我是人，我更是一個少女丨</p>
<p>在那麽兩位一體似的結合下，在那</p>
<p>麽息息相關的生活中，誰也想不到她們竟是這樣的神離貌合，中問橫截着那麽一道狠毒的鴻溝，好像一個握有實權的大老婆駕凌着小老婆一樣，不過這兒是充满着金錢的誘惑，而没有酸意的嘲弄。</p>
<p>鴇母口中的阿英，是一個怪特别的妓女，而且最没良心，比如在去年一二八戰爭時，鴇母病了，無法監護她，她便也装病不出門，有時却成日成夜的說到蘇州河看勢閙去了，晚上呌她出門做生意，便籍口什麽戒嚴，說馬路上簡直没有人走，白天呢，儘管厮混一天轉來，没有賬交不打緊，還要使氣：「你想白天有生意做麽？飛機是那麽軋軋的在天空呌，風聲又是這樣緊急，誰還有閒情閒錢呢？」</p>
<p>鴇母是惱恨她透了，整整的一個月，她僅僅交賬四十元，向她略略盤問，便要冒火生氣。</p>
<p>鴇母慶幸着，「福星高照」，病畢竟</p>
<p>隨着東洋兵攻開閙北的最後一砲聲裏脫纏了。</p>
<p>她出門去了，相熟的人都這樣恭維她：「你的阿英近來好像變了似的，闊綽得很啦！」最是老四說得掩眼活像：那一天遇着她坐了汽車在馬路上兜風，那一天又見她挾了一個小白臉上某某大旅社去了，而且探知她是怎樣的引誘邦小白臉，使他貼伏在她懷裏，任憑她擺佈，玩弄，像一頭哈叭狗似的扮演着「倒嫖」。</p>
<p>鴇母這一聽來，毛骨都悚然了，眞夢也不曾夢想過小小的阿英竟有這麽一齣勾當。呵，難怪她完全變了，做了生意，也總說白在街頭站拉了一天，而且藉口晚上戒嚴，便登在家裏不動，她原在外面倒嫖小白臉呵。</p>
<p>「阿英，你好膽，敢在老媽前玩巧了·値價點把你這個月的厮混情形，如</p>
<p>實招來，如實招來！」</p>
<p>「没有什麽，我不是每天每天的報告過了嗎了麽！那一天進賬三元，那一天没有拉到生意」。阿英有點駭然，她意識到鴇母病一好，又是向她們出氣的時候了，不然醫藥費那裏有着落呢？　　阿英正自忖着：只是鴇母的姘夫胡</p>
<p>麻子，曾給她介紹過一個什麽姓趙的老軍官，满腮於思於思的，却還那麽賣老，勉强陪了他一夜，其後還老是來糾纏。但那次也依照規矩交了賬的，只是趙老頭额外給的一點，我就私地收下了，難道這不可以麽，如實招來，難道就是這個麽！　　至說與王小臉有點往來，那要我才有這種本事，而且我是一個少女，而且是花我私家的錢，難道我們少女的命裏就註定了專供趙老頭那般的死人玩弄的麽？哼，絕不是！</p>
<p>大姐和小姐</p>
<p>阿英正在自忖，没有回答下去，鴇母一棒便把她打將塌地了，接着是許多帮閒的人拳打脚踢。　　阿英自衛着掙扎着呌喊着；</p>
<p>「我是人！我更是一個少女！」</p>

<p>怎能使我不懷念呢，一年前的今日！　　那時候，也是夏天剛剛過去，酷暑已换了秋凉，一陣陣新秋的和風，吹在人的身上，起了一種莫名的舒適。在首都的豐潤門外，兩旁是澄淸的湖水，四遠是靑綠的山色，當中引延着一條長堤　　栽着　　　　　　　　　　　　人的頭上來，秋蟬在鳴着她的悲哀。可是，在我與她，一些感不到嚴肅的意味。在我們内心充满着的，祗有如和煦的春天的熱烈的情緖。</p>
<p>這時，我們在長堤上漫步着，暫時各歸靜默，充分地享受大自然的賜予。忽然，從東邊飛來一朶白雲，宛如拖起一個長鼻的大象，但是幾次旋轉，倐然又變成了一條張牙舞爪的神龍了。她仰視着，不禁嘆着說：『秋雲多幻，此時觀之，信然！』</p>
<p>『要掉文了。』我笑着說。突然一種感喟走上了我的心頭：』人事的變遷恐怕還要更甚呢！』</p>
<p>我的臉色由　　而　　　　　心頭似乎罩着一重暗影，而這暗影的分兩，又似乎越來越重，重得使我透不過氣來。</p>
<p>牠似乎也覺到有點異樣，然而她却不顯露出來，因爲她知道如果過於重視了時，祗有使事態更加嚴重，而於我亦祗有不利。所以她祗淡淡的笑說：</p>
<p>『你這話未免有些似是而實非吧，在我的許多同學中間，在我的許我親戚中間，雖然也有變幻得很快的，不過居最少數；而大部分的却大多很順利的按步進行着···而况在一個革命靑年的態度，祗有抓住現實，不應懷想未來，尤不應對未來悲觀。瑜！樂觀吧，我們的前途是最光明的。』</p>
<p>她那温和的態度，慷慨的字句，火樣的熱情，使我感覺得興奮，我的心頭的暗影已消滅于無形。我們手挽着手止於一株大柳樹下了。</p>
<p>『這裏坐好嗎？』</p>
<p>『很好。』</p>
<p>於是我們把手帕掉出來，攤在地下，我們倚傍着坐了下來。柳影蔭蔽着我們，一陣陣的風從對面吹來，把她的短髮吹昨蓬蓬鬆鬆的飘了起來。我們談話，我們笑，我們看看一會兒看着頭上飛過的白雲，一會兒看看四遠的山色，一會兒又看看湖中的游艇。這時我倆差不多已經給大自然陶醉了。</p>
<p>突然一個輕倩而嬌嫩聲音在我們的背後發了出來：　　『先生，小姐，坐船到湖中去玩玩嗎？』</p>
<p>我回頭看淸楚了是一個船娘時，我便徵求她的同意，她點頭應允了，我們便先後的跳上船去，船娘把簥子向岸上一點，那船便向荷塘深處慢慢的進行了。這富有詩意的境地，使人忘記了一切，而她却不自禁的低低的歌唱起來了。　　那天，的印象於我是如何的深刻啊！　　現在，我因了生活的鞭策，已經飘流到上海來了。一切的一切，祗覺得喧囂，惡濁。而她呢，因爲有好久没有音訊了，不知究竟是如何的情狀？　　　　人事的變動，比較秋蟬更甚呢！</p>

<p>Zhang Renjie Leads Troops to Station in Wanquan</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, He Yingqin invited Qin Decun to discuss detailed plans for the aftermath of Chahar Province, as well as the reorganization of finance, military, and administration. It is reported that concrete measures have been drafted and will be submitted for discussion at tomorrow's regular military branch meeting. Among the Chahar Provincial Government members, there are three Mongolian princes who have not yet arrived in Zhangjiakou. Song has sent telegrams urging them to come, but there is no news of their arrival, so the date for the inauguration of all members cannot be determined. Lu Fu, the Director of the Education Department, has reportedly expressed his intention not to take office again. Qin Decun said that rumors of a coalition between Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Tang Yulin, and Liu Guitang are not accurate because Liu recently surrounded and resolved the Li Brigade of Fang's forces. As for Fang's title, it can only be discussed after he leaves the army. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou states that Lu Fu has telegraphed the provincial government, requesting to resign from the position of Director of the Education Department.

<p>All Repelled by the Defending Troops</p>
<p>The Bandit Suppression Army Launches a Full-Scale Offensive</p>
<p>The Red Bandits Flee West in Several Routes</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) □□□ A unit of the division pushed to Yancheng, and all bandit suppression armies in northern Fujian launched a full-scale offensive on the □ day. Yesterday, Peng Dehuai's bandits used hundreds of "dare-to-die" soldiers to attack the east gate of Yancheng three times, but they were annihilated by Jiang Brigade with machine guns and cannons. (11th Dispatch)</p>

On the 11th, the communist bandits suffered a complete collapse and fled west towards Shaowu, Shaxian, and Yong'an. Those who fled to Shaowu were attacked by Liu and Zhou's troops and were no longer a coherent force. Those who fled to Yong'an were intercepted by the 61st and 78th Divisions. This force seems to be still heading towards western Fujian, Longyan. The Longyan area is now preparing to intercept them. (12th Dispatch)</p>

Failing in Jiangxi, they are trying to find a foothold. The troops in northern Fujian are few, so they have taken advantage. Although Yanping has been lost and regained, the siege has not been lifted, and the dangerous atmosphere is spreading to Yongtai, which is only a short distance from the provincial capital. If it is captured again, the overall situation will be even more unmanageable, and it is not only the misfortune of all Fujian. Please quickly transfer elite troops from Zhejiang and Jiangxi to suppress them, and also order the Chaoshan Guangdong army to send more troops to attack Longyan and destroy their nest. They presented their words with tears. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The National Government Sends Luo Wengan to Supervise the Oath</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sheng Shicai took the oath of office as the Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang Province on the 7th in Dihua. The National Government sent Luo Wengan to supervise the oath. Sheng issued a telegram on the 7th, stating that he was appointed by the National Government as the Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang Province and that Minister Luo Wengan was sent to Xinjiang to supervise the oath. Shicai took the oath of office on September 7. Xinjiang Province is located on the border and has been slow to develop. Since the Republic of China, the authorities have been simple and conservative, leading to a decline in military affairs and politics. At a time when the country is in distress and the local situation is turbulent, if we do not catch up quickly, it will lead to mistakes in the border situation. Shicai is ashamed of his incompetence, but he has been entrusted with the border defense. He swears to follow the orders of the Central Government with sincerity, promote the teachings of the Premier, and do everything that should be done, as long as it is beneficial to the country. However, with the materials of a humble tree, he deeply fears the abyss of ice, and earnestly hopes that the party and state elders and comrades from all walks of life will provide timely guidance so that he can follow it. He hereby sends this telegram and eagerly awaits it. Respectfully, Sheng Yangcai, Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, saving the nation through aviation should not merely seek talent in flight techniques, as that is not the fundamental purpose. We must awaken the people to establish our own factories to build military and commercial aircraft. In the current situation of our country, at least 80% of the materials used for each aircraft must be domestic products in order to truly save the nation through aviation and strengthen our air defense. This flight of mine is also to awaken the people to pay attention to manufacturing their own aircraft. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) When a Central News Agency reporter inquired about the Ministry of Finance's recent loan of 12 million yuan from Shanghai's banking community, a senior official from the Ministry of Finance said that the national treasury has been short of funds and unable to meet expenditures. After Minister Song returned to China, he immediately borrowed 12 million yuan from Shanghai's banking community, which is very common. The Ministry of Finance borrows and repays debts every day. It is difficult to define a clear boundary for the use of this money, as various expenses are used at any time, and debts are incurred only when there is a shortfall. Therefore, it is not limited to relief in the North China war zone. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Cannot practice law within the jurisdiction of the original court for three years (Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice has stipulated that retired personnel from local courts cannot practice law in the area of their former court within one year, according to the Ministry's order. Recently, considering that there are not many transfers of judges in various courts within this one year, and the relationship between the retired personnel and their old colleagues cannot be easily severed, the original one-year limit seems too short. Yesterday, a circular was issued to the high courts of various provinces, instructing them to inform their affiliated bar associations to change this provision to three years. In the future, any newly registered lawyers who have served as presiding judges, prosecutors, or apprentice prosecutors, as well as clerks, recorders, and other staff in various courts, shall not practice law within the jurisdiction of their former court for three years from the date of their retirement.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xichang and four others, sent by the Rural Reconstruction Committee to Henan Province to investigate the rural economy, have completed their work and returned to Beijing. According to them, Henan Province has suffered disasters for years, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The main products of counties in northern and southern Henan are rice and wheat, but opium seedlings are grown in several counties in eastern Henan. The provincial government originally issued orders prohibiting the planting of opium seedlings, but the prohibition seems to contain incentives. Only eight yuan is fined per mu of land planted with opium seedlings. In reality, this fine is a disguised opium tax. In short, the key to improving the rural economy in Henan Province is to first reduce taxes to alleviate the burden on farmers. Second, banditry must be eliminated before production techniques can be improved and the quantity of production can be increased. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

Excerpts from the content are as follows: "Comrades have uncertain estimates of the current revolutionary situation, lack confidence in the Soviet, and lack understanding of the offensive route, resulting in the great reduction of the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet area. Chongyi and Shangyou have been completely lost. Soviet workers have retreated and fled, and even shameful phenomena of betrayal have occurred. The Red Army has been reduced by more than half, with desertions reaching three to four thousand. Furthermore, the mobilization of the economy in Hunan and Hubei is even more insufficient. More than 10,000 yuan of public bonds have not yet been sold. Yongxin only collects half of the land tax. The recent grain borrowing campaign has also not been done well. The finances of the entire province are not unified. Soviets at all levels collect and use their own funds, and there are even instances of embezzlement and squandering, grievances, or unauthorized use of tax revenues and public bond funds. Such corruption and waste are common phenomena in Hunan and Jiangxi," and so on. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Naval Disarmament Conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan A Major Key to World Disarmament After the Washington and London Conferences <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Japan, under the guise of strengthening its military, is actually expanding its navy. The United States is also catching up rapidly. Before 1936, according to the industrial recovery plan, it will build 39 warships, supplementing them as much as possible within the limits allowed by the London Treaty and the financial resources of the United States. The United Kingdom, seeing the rapid progress of Japan and the rapid catching up of the United States, feels deeply threatened by its interests in the Far East and the unease of Australia and India, and is also rising to compete, planning to build 15 excellent cruisers every year. From now on, not only will there be no peace in the Pacific, but it is also feared that it will extend to the Indian Ocean, and the world will become more troubled.</p>
<p>Since Japan provoked the Mukden Incident and forcibly seized our three northeastern provinces, although it has used "scorched earth diplomacy" as a tool to resist international cooperation, after the failure of the World Economic Conference, economic alliances have prevailed, followed by naval competition. Japan, which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, how can it long confront these two naval giants? Therefore, the news of a reconvened conference of the three naval powers was issued from Japan. Currently, the London Treaty is about to expire. At this time when the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan are actively preparing for naval competition, such a conference may not be easy to convene. Even if it is convened, it is feared that it will fall into the same rut as the economic conference. However, today's world economic panic has not passed. The United Kingdom and Japan cannot but take into account their national strength. Therefore, a naval disarmament conference may still be convened. If this three-power conference does become a reality, it must first have a practical and appropriate solution to the following three issues. Otherwise, the Second World War will become increasingly imminent and impossible to ease.</p>
<p>First, there is the issue of the four northeastern provinces. The general public in Japan is anesthetized by militarists who take force as God, thinking that "Manchuria" has already become a fait accompli, and will never allow China to take it back or allow foreign countries to interfere. However, the Far Eastern market has been almost fully developed. The civilization of the Yellow River basin has become a thing of the past, and the prosperity of the Yangtze River is also drying up. India and Australia are all within the scope of the British Empire, then the only promising market in the future is the three northeastern provinces. Now it is forcibly occupied by Japan. Our China will certainly not submit, and how can the United Kingdom and the United States be willing to finally retreat? Therefore, the core of the three-power conference, the goal of the Pacific hegemony, lies here. If the issue of the four northeastern provinces is not properly resolved, not only will the area be a world powder keg, with the danger of explosion at any time, but the century-old root of disaster lurking in the Far East will continue to play out historical tragedies, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>Second, the defense of the Indian Ocean and the security of Australia. At first glance, the situation seems far less urgent than the storm in the Pacific. Moreover, there are many possibilities for the political relationship between the United Kingdom and Japan to be close, and it is easy to turn around between countries. However, it must be known that the British management of the Far East takes our country's Yangtze River basin as its outpost, Hong Kong as the first line, and Singapore as the second line. India is its base. Recently, the Japanese Empire has developed rapidly and has taken the four northeastern provinces into its pocket. Its economic power has crossed Singapore and invaded India. After that, the military goal will shift from the army to the navy, from the mainland to the ocean, passing through the Nanyang Islands, Malalin, and Caroline, which are administered by Japan, and heading towards Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, the United Kingdom has long been preparing for the construction of the port of Singapore to protect its eastern treasure house of India, and adding new ships to consolidate Australia. This opposition between the United Kingdom and Japan's offense and defense is not easy to ease. Third, military defense and arms competition in the Pacific. On the one hand, it is indeed due to the rivalry between Japan and the United States for hegemony. At the Washington Conference, the relationship between Japan and the United States almost broke down with the 5:5:3 naval ratio. The London Treaty only maintained the 5:3 ratio for battleships. Light and heavy cruisers and destroyers were almost in a ratio of 10:7, while submarines had an average ratio between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. However, the submarines of the United Kingdom and the United States are old and slow. In fact, Japan's submarines have surpassed the United Kingdom and the United States. Due to the Washington Treaty, the facilities of military ports in the Philippines and Guam have been suspended. In the event of an incident, it is inevitable that they will be captured by Japan. This is what the United States is deeply concerned about. If the three-power conference is successful, the military facilities of the United States in the Eastern naval base will inevitably become the center of the dispute between Japan and the United States. Moreover, the Japanese military is currently working hard to advocate breaking the naval restrictions of the Washington and London treaties to expand the Japanese navy. If so, not only will the Philippines be uneasy, but Honolulu will also be shaken. This is also a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>The above three points are the basis of the antagonistic relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. During the period of contention, will it be a conflict between Japan and the United States, a conflict between the United Kingdom and Japan, or will the United Kingdom and Japan unite to control the United States, or will the United Kingdom and the United States unite to control Japan? According to the current situation, a conflict between the United Kingdom and Japan seems unavoidable, and the possibility of a union between the United Kingdom and the United States is greater than that of an alliance between the United Kingdom and Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Arakii Presents National Policy to Actively Open Up the Extraordinary Situation <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Fascists Plot to Overthrow the Cabinet</p>
<p>Brewing a New Situation of Military Domination</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Finance Minister visited Prime Minister Saito at 9:00 this morning and presented the Army Minister's national policy plan. Thus, the Army's demands have been openly presented to the government by the Finance Minister.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Araki advocates the establishment of a national policy. The specific plan presented to the Finance Minister earlier involves international relations and domestic relations and is quite extensive. The Finance Minister has studied it one by one and will meet with the Army Minister two or three more times in the near future. At the same time, the Army Minister will meet with Prime Minister Saito, cabinet members, and influential figures from the private sector to explain the current national situation and promote national enthusiasm. In particular, the Army Minister's academic studies have revealed one aspect of the national policy embraced by the military. At the same time, it expresses the Army's attitude towards the political situation. It has always been said that the Army holds an attitude against political parties and welcomes a non-partisan cabinet. At present, the Army does not favor a non-partisan cabinet or a party cabinet. If it can implement a policy of eliminating the causes of social unrest, it will welcome it. From this point of view, placing the establishment of a national policy as the first priority, it has forced the current cabinet to implement it. Whether the Saito cabinet will accommodate it is a major test, and the impact on the future political situation is also extremely significant. It is extremely noteworthy what attitude the Saito cabinet will take to deal with it. (Dentsu dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Prime Minister Saito earnestly cooperated with the political parties, it aroused the resistance of domestic feudal forces, such as various factions from the House of Peers, the retired military group Meirin-kai, the Japan National Socialist Party representing the small and medium-sized landlord class, and the Production Party representing the small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists. This faction is collectively known as the feudal fascist faction, with the current military leaders as its highest commanders. It is reported that Tanaka Chiju and Koizumi Shiro have secretly negotiated several times and decided to take a proactive offensive against the Saito cabinet in order to realize the military's dictatorship. The reasons they advocated are: (1) We believe that the Saito cabinet has assumed power to solve the extraordinary situation, so we have actively supported it to this day. However, recently Saito has abandoned his mission and not only dares not to eliminate the evil financial cliques and their political party tools, but also compromises and cooperates with political parties. This move should be regarded as the government's surrender to the door of money and power. (2) The purpose of political parties in cooperating with the government is to restore party rule and reduce military spending. In today's isolated international situation, not a single hair of military spending can be reduced. It is reported that Meirin-kai and the National Socialist Party, for the reasons mentioned above, will convene a national conference in Tokyo in mid-October to oppose the government and use the power of the masses to achieve their goal of injuring the military warlords. How will Araki deal with this? It is definitely worth paying attention to. (Kareni-Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Anglo-American-Japanese Naval Competition <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Japan Compares Itself to Tigers and Wolves Compared to England and America</p>
<p>The Impending War in the Pacific</p>
<p>According to the Nagoya Shimbun, since the United States announced its massive naval construction plan, the United Kingdom has followed suit by implementing supplementary warship enhancements. Other countries like France and Italy have also been significantly stimulated. All countries are striving to expand within the limits set by the Second Washington Naval Treaty of 1935. According to information received by the Japanese Foreign Ministry from London on the 4th, the US Navy Department's increased spending plan includes: (1) building twenty-nine superior cruisers; (2) building fifteen to eighteen destroyers annually; (3) expanding the fleet's aviation equipment; (4) increasing personnel by 10,000; and (5) increasing ship fuel and training expenses. This expansion plan is scheduled to be submitted in the next fiscal year. Although the purpose of building a large fleet is not clear, its objectives can be easily inferred as: (1) The United Kingdom has the same ratio as the United States in the Washington and London treaties. In the past, the interests of the United Kingdom and the United States were opposed during the World Economic Conference, so the United Kingdom had to decide to build more warships. (2) To reserve a powerful voice in the future Second Washington Conference, and to have sufficient preparation in case the conference breaks down. (3) The United Kingdom has vast colonies around the world, and it is necessary to protect communications with the colonies. (4) Commercial and trade relations between the United Kingdom and Japan have recently deteriorated, to prevent conflict with Japan, while strongly supporting the British Empire Economic Alliance to suppress Japan. As for the United States, in the 1934 fiscal year (i.e., from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year), the total budget implemented reached 406 million yuan, which is the largest amount of military spending since the Washington Conference. Among them, (1) the new warship construction budget is 43,910,785 yuan, with 46,000,000 yuan from the industrial recovery fund, totaling 89,910,785 yuan; (2) the warship modification cost is budgeted at 5,500,000 yuan, with 30,000,000 yuan from the industrial recovery fund, totaling 35,500,000 yuan; (3) the aircraft construction cost is budgeted at 8,100,000 yuan; (4) the land and water equipment cost is budgeted at 1,946,950 yuan; (5) other miscellaneous expenses are budgeted at 264,029,190 yuan. The above four or five items are reduced by 47 million yuan, while 84 million yuan is spent from the industrial recovery fund. Items two, three, four, and five total 316 million yuan, combined with the first item, totaling more than 459 million yuan.</p>
<p>Our country (Japan) is also striving to enrich its armaments and improve its equipment, with the 1935 disarmament conference approaching. Since the Manchurian Incident, the situation of the Empire regarding the four countries has gradually become tense. In addition to enriching equipment in the Showa 8, 9, and 13 fiscal years, and in order to improve the system, under the possible implementation policy, we are actively preparing for the main tasks of enriching preparations, namely: (1) preparing materials in the Showa 8, 9, and 13 fiscal years, manufacturing new weapons, with a cost of 350 million yuan; (2) using 15.38 million yuan as operating education expenses in the Showa 8, 9, and 2 fiscal years (i.e., for the purpose of operating and using new weapons by officers and soldiers below the rank of general). Currently, training is being conducted for officers at infantry schools, cavalry schools, field artillery schools, engineering schools, various aviation schools, automobile schools, etc. For non-commissioned officers and soldiers, supplementary education is provided in each regiment. The main deployment and enrichment of new weapons are roughly as follows: (1) In terms of infantry, equipping machine guns and adopting new infantry artillery (regimental artillery and company artillery, etc.); (2) In terms of cavalry, equipping machine guns in cavalry regiments of each division, and assigning machine gun teams to each regiment of brigade cavalry; (3) Artillery field artillery regiments, increasing light mortars, updating the system of each artillery, and increasing anti-aircraft artillery and searchlight teams; (4) In engineering telegraph regiments, enriching the A company; (5) Supply troops, enriching mechanical supply; (6) Others, such as newly established motorized infantry, motorized artillery, motorized engineers, motorized signal corps, heavy tanks, and other mobile corps research institutions, facilities research and surveying meteorology, and improving wireless communication education, etc.</p>
<p>On the same day, an editorial was also published, stating that the United States' large replenishment plan and the United Kingdom's large warship construction plan make Japan feel like it is being attacked from both the front and back doors. Why? The United States' increase of thirty-seven warships and the United Kingdom's increase of fifty warships are originally intended for war preparations against Japan. Because since the London Conference, until today, public opinion in the United States has not favored the expenditure of warship construction costs. Unexpectedly, recently, there has been a major change in attitude, with the government and the public unanimously supporting the proposal. However, it is incomprehensible to use unemployment relief and industrial recovery as a pretext to announce the warship construction plan. Relieving unemployment depends on production, but now spending huge amounts of national treasury on non-productive warship construction is greatly contrary to the original purpose of unemployment relief. Also, news recently came from London that Japan has secretly manufactured a large number of submarine parts beyond treaty restrictions, and stored them in Yokosuka and Kure naval ports. These parts can be assembled into complete warships in a few days. It is not known where this news came from. It can be seen that the fact that Britain and the United States trample on international credibility and despise the sanctity of treaties (this is Japan's speculation based on its own behavior) is difficult to conceal. Currently, Japan's opposition to the lack of credibility of Britain and the United States is only based on moral diplomacy. However, tigers and wolves have approached Japan's front and back doors, and Japan will not sit idly by and watch their warship construction competition. Therefore, even though our country (Japan) is in extreme financial difficulty, in order to consolidate national defense, it must establish a fundamental policy.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Japan Denies Three-Power Conference <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The London Daily Express recently reported that a naval disarmament conference is being conducted among the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry resolutely denies this statement. The warship construction competition among the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan has recently emerged suddenly, and the momentum of each authority trying to prevent such a phenomenon is gradually rising, resulting in this misreporting. The general disarmament conference of the League of Nations is currently in progress. After the conference reopens in October, it is planned to discuss the reduction of air and land forces. As for naval reduction, it was originally agreed upon by the five naval powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Italy, and France. Therefore, a five-power naval conference should be convened when necessary. However, the current situation does not require this. Therefore, a treaty revision conference of London or Washington is unlikely to be held before 1935. There has never been any exchange of notes between Japan and the United States regarding this issue. (December 12th, Jiji News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers have recently repeatedly published news about foreign countries concluding secret agreements to harm Japan, foreign spies engaging in activities in Japan, Soviet Russian troops concentrating on the Manchurian border, foreign maritime military preparations now competing, and various incidents of foreign animosity towards Japan. The general public quite believes in these statements. Some say that this is the Japanese authorities' vigorous preparation for war, in order to make the people pay attention and shift from domestic to foreign affairs. However, this statement is not recognized by those in charge. They firmly believe that those responsible for Japan's national defense are extremely willing to obtain peace and engage in recuperation, so as to leisurely consolidate their new position in Asia gained in the past two years. Japan should not engage in large-scale wars externally until this work is completed, just as Soviet Russia does not want to take any action externally until the five-year construction plan is completed. Those who observe the situation from the outside feel that the positions of Russia and Japan are the same, and both are temporarily enduring hardships and suppressing foreign demons, so that they can recuperate their people and encourage the completion of construction work. No matter how rampant foreign demons are, and how serious their impact on the people of the two countries is, the Russian and Japanese authorities both have reasons to temporarily prefer peace and do not want to start wars immediately. Both sides will at least maintain this intention until the construction work is completed. (December 12th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Paris) French Minister of Aviation Cot today will lead an important flight inspection team to Moscow. Among the personnel are French civil aviation leader Pouville and Cordos and Rossi, who recently set the world long-distance flight record. Those who are attentive to political affairs believe that the flight inspection team's visit to Russia, which comes after former French Prime Minister Herriot's tour of Soviet Russia and consultations with the leading figures of the authorities, contains very significant implications. (December 12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Minister of Aviation Cot began leading an air squadron to visit the Soviet Union today. Two of the aircraft he led departed first at 10:40 am for the Czech capital. As for the aircraft Cot was on, it will depart in the afternoon, because Cot will first go to Strasbourg to inspect the aviation regiment there, and then depart from that city early tomorrow morning. The three aircraft will meet in Lviv, Poland, and then go to Kharkov and Moscow in Soviet Russia, stopping only in Kyiv. Although the air squadron led by Cot only has three aircraft, the "Le Bourget" aircraft driven by aviators Cordos and Rossi will also go to Moscow. If the weather is suitable, they plan to make a non-stop flight. In addition, there is also a small three-engine aircraft "Pianese", which is also going to Moscow, but it is purely private. This aircraft is owned by Captain Fanhevin, a famous aviator who first flew from France to New Caledonia. As for the purpose of this flight, according to Major Yue Nuo, the confidential secretary of the Aviation Department who participated in this flight, it is to promote the relationship between French and Russian commercial aviation. Currently, European aviation routes only extend to the Polish border, and this trip will seek to expand them. Also, this flight has a more diplomatic purpose. The Soviet Union recently sent an aviation counselor to France, so France is also repaying the visit with an air squadron. In addition, Minister of Aviation Cot leads three aircraft and the "Le Bourget" and "Pianese" aircraft, taking the opportunity to show the development of modern commercial aviation to the Soviet Union, which is also one of the purposes of this trip.

<p>Preparing for Future Recommendations for Improvement</p>
<p>Colon (Panama Canal Zone) US Naval Commander in Chief Swanson arrived here today and stated that the US fleet will remain stationed in the Pacific. This move has no other reason. The previous government sent the fleet to the Pacific coast for cost-saving reasons. If it is transferred back, it will only waste national currency and be of little benefit. Moreover, the climate there is mild, and all supplies are cheaper, and cheaper fuel can be obtained. He also said that when he passed through Havana, he did not disembark because he did not want to cause misunderstandings. He did not receive orders or telegrams from the President, and had absolutely no relationship with the actions of the State Department. He was afraid that Cuban people might misunderstand that he was attempting to interfere, so he only stopped briefly in Havana harbor and came here. Swanson will inspect defenses in the Panama Canal for several days, preparing for future recommendations for appropriation improvements. Afterwards, he will go to Honolulu and then return to the Pacific coast to inspect naval ports and docks in Bremerton, Vallejo, and San Diego. (November 11th, Guomin News Agency)</p>

Although ordering representatives to attend will not be subject to political restrictions, it has been half a year since the withdrawal was announced. If they attend now, there is a risk of diluting the spirit of withdrawal. Moreover, the agenda does not include Sino-Japanese issues.

<p>The Future of Negotiations is Perilous</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway have stalled since the fourth private meeting on August 23rd, because the pseudo-state proposed a conversion rate of 2.5 Japanese 角 per ruble, while the Russian side did not propose a counter-proposal. Afterwards, the Russian side specially sent Barshunikov of the National Bank to Japan to study the conversion rate of rubles to Japanese yen. However, the negotiations have not been reopened. Recently, the Russian delegation has suddenly changed its attitude and adopted a tough policy. Although the Japanese and "Manchu" authorities do not know the reason, they consider the Russian attitude regrettable. If the Russian side maintains its current attitude, they do not hesitate to suspend the negotiations. Therefore, if the Russian side does not change its attitude, the future of the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations will inevitably become dangerous. (December 12th, Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The transfer negotiations of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been obstructed due to the wavering attitude of the Soviet Union. However, the true intention of the Soviet Union in delaying the negotiations seems to be for the following reasons: (1) The pseudo-state's tough attitude is only a threat; (2) If the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations are resolved, the Sakhalin oil problem and the North Pacific fishing problem will inevitably be proposed for negotiation and resolution. Therefore, showing weakness at this time is not a good strategy; (3) The Soviet Union has already concluded non-aggression treaties with its western neighboring countries, so it can focus on the Eastern problem. However, the intention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the military authorities is that if the Soviet Union really harbors this ambition, it can only resolutely unite with "Manchuria", stop the negotiations, and the Japanese and "Manchu" countries will seek countermeasures based on their own positions.

<p>Vienna Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss declared in a speech today that parliamentary politics in Austria have become a thing of the past and may never be seen again. Today is the anniversary of Austria's defeat of the invading Turkish army in 1683. Dollfuss addressed more than 70,000 people and broadcast to the whole country by radio, and also made it known to all European countries, with the intention of making other countries pay attention as well. Wang Shi expressed that Austria is on the verge of complete dictatorship, and the government style it will adopt will fundamentally eliminate free capitalism, materialistic selfish Marxism, and political terrorism. The so-called political terrorism clearly refers to the German National Socialist Party, which Dollfuss pointed out as the force that is forcing Austria to take extreme actions. Dr. expressed that Austria is grateful for the support of friendly countries, but wants to consolidate its own government and strengthen its military strength when possible, claiming, "We must have strength, but we must have the right to obtain this strength by our own methods." When discussing the fact that the National Socialist Party is creating disturbances in Austria and attempting to overthrow the government, he claimed, "Austria has always expressed its willingness to maintain friendship with Germany, and still wishes to have this friendship, but it must be a friendship of honor. Otherwise, it will be worthless. What we require is complete freedom within our borders, and we want to maintain this freedom." According to news from various European capitals tonight, most claim that this speech is actually equivalent to announcing Austria's intention to establish a dictatorial government.

<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States welcomes any government in Cuba that can maintain order and represent the will of the people. When asked if a radical government could be recognized, Hull replied that the form of government is not important. Whether the Cuban people truly approve of the current interim government or decide to form another government, if there is good order, we can all not interfere too much. Hull also expressed that the US government deeply feels responsible for ensuring that Cuba does not fall apart due to riots and terrorist acts. (November 11th, Guomin News Agency)</p>

<p>Nami, the deputy director of the Puppet State Opium Monopoly Bureau, recently visited various parts of Rehe Province to inspect the opium harvest. He then went to Chengde, Jianping, and Luanping before returning to the puppet capital to report. The area planted with opium in Rehe Province is indeed 400,000 mu, exceeding expectations. The harvest is expected to be 100,000 jin. Adding the harvest managed in northern Manchuria and Liaoning, there will be an additional 30,000 to 40,000 jin. The opium monopoly is expected to be quite successful. The Puppet Ministry of Finance is working very actively in Rehe. The Puppet Capital Police Department, upon the order of the Puppet People's Government, has approved provinces to increase the number of licensed opium retailers as appropriate.

<h3 id="e88">Detailed Report on the Chongming Typhoon Disaster <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Over 400 Deaths, Extensive Damage</p>
<p>Chongming Island is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, close to Sheshan Mountain, and therefore suffered the most from the recent hurricane. On the evening of the second, the hurricane blew southwest, causing seawater to flow back into the Yangtze River. It also coincided with the high tide on the 13th day of the lunar calendar, causing the river tide to rise sharply by over a zhang. The fierce waves poured like mountains, surrounding the sea, and all the embankments were breached. The entire county, except for the city walls and the high ground in the center, was submerged, with water depths ranging from two or three chi to over a zhang. Although the water has receded within the county, the coastal areas are still flooded due to the breaches in the embankments. According to investigations, the number of people drowned has already exceeded 400, with the number of missing still difficult to count. Corpses are found everywhere, a truly tragic sight. The fifth district, which mainly produces grain and corn, had already harvested its crops and stored them at home, but they were either washed away or submerged. The losses are enormous. Countless houses were washed away or collapsed, leaving countless people homeless and in need of food. Party and government authorities and citizens such as Wang Qingmu have sent telegrams to higher authorities and charitable organizations in Shanghai, requesting urgent relief. Detailed reports on the affected areas are as follows: District 1: Dozens of houses collapsed in the southern area near the city, and crops were damaged, but there were no fatalities. In Hongqiao Town in the north, the embankments were completely destroyed, and the water level was six chi above ground, destroying over 60 houses and drowning five elderly people and children. The entire town of Beipaiyazhen was washed away, with over 60 houses collapsing and over ten people, including Wu Shanqing, dying. Meijiahe was already prone to landslides and had the most dangerous terrain. That night, the tide reached over a zhang above ground level. Fortunately, residents along the coast had evacuated in advance, but over 100 thatched and tiled houses were washed away or collapsed, and over 20 villagers were killed or injured. District 2: In the northern part of Bangzhen, west of places like Miaogang and Zhangwanggang, the embankments completely collapsed, with over 200 houses collapsing and as many as 50 villagers drowning. The entire Yonghe Yuhuangsha sandbar was submerged, and the water has not yet receded, making it impossible to estimate the extent of the damage. In Nansha, nine out of ten embankments were breached, and over 60 thatched houses were washed away. However, villagers, mindful of the 1920 flood, had evacuated to higher ground in advance and were not drowned. District 3: The thatched houses in the boundaries of the Eighth Map were all blown away. The water level in the northern part of Dachunzhen was six chi high, killing or injuring six or seven people and destroying over ten houses. In the villages of Zhuchun, Xiezhi, and Dongxiang Tongtadun, corpses were seen everywhere, a sight too painful to describe. It is estimated that over a hundred people drowned. The water level in various places is still over four chi high, and the losses are enormous, making it impossible to estimate for the time being. District 4: In the northern and southern forts, 19 power lines and poles were broken. The northern coast suffered less damage. In the northern coastal town of Hexingzhen, the east-west embankments were breached by the tide, collapsing over 100 houses and drowning 60 to 70 villagers. District 5: Located in the eastern corner, the terrain is low-lying, and the embankments are soft, making it particularly vulnerable to disaster. In the northern coastal villages, such as Jingze, Yusheng, and Caomiao, over 20 embankments were breached, with water depths exceeding one zhang, drowning over a hundred men and women. Crops such as flowers, grains, and beans were completely submerged and rotted. Thatched houses were completely destroyed, and nine out of ten tiled houses collapsed. The floodwater is still four or five chi deep, leaving the survivors displaced, exposed to the elements, and starving. District 6: The terrain is relatively high, but the water level in both the north and south coasts reached three or four chi. The embankments outside Wananzhen were breached, destroying over ten thatched houses and drowning seven or eight people. District 7: The disaster affected over one-third of the entire district, with the northeastern coast of Mengjiangmiao being the most severely affected. The water depth was over five chi, and thatched and tiled houses were submerged and destroyed everywhere. In the area of Dalongsha, several embankments were breached. The official embankments of Men'an, Liangzi, Xingzi, Xizi, and Zizu, as well as the northwestern coast of Haihongzhen, were all breached, turning the area into a vast swamp. Fortunately, villagers evacuated early, and only over 30 people were crushed or drowned. However, a large amount of rice, miscellaneous items, and livestock were washed into the sea, resulting in massive losses. In the county's Shengshan fishing area, over 100 houses were destroyed that night, and around 300 fishing boats were smashed and sunk. The number of fishermen killed is impossible to count. Two-thirds of the fishermen have lost their homes and are facing starvation. Party and government authorities have hired ships and sent personnel to provide relief. There was also much loss in Sijing, Daji, Xiaoji, and other mountains, but the details are unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Mei Yilin Inspects the Flood Situation on the North Bank of the Yellow River <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>=After arriving in Shouzhang, he convened the county magistrates for consultation=</p>
<p>=Returned to Jinan and then went to Henan to inspect the affected areas=</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This time, the Yellow River breached its banks in Hebei and Henan, flooding twenty counties and affecting millions of people. The situation is extremely dire. The central government, in order to coordinate relief efforts, specially appointed Mei Yilin as the disaster investigation commissioner, who went to Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces to inspect the affected areas. After arriving in Shandong, Mei first went from Yanzhou to Jining and then to Xiangcheng, Yutai, Jiaxiang, and Jinxiang. On the evening of the eighth, he arrived in Jinan from the affected areas. On the morning of the ninth, he went to Luokou again, and inspected the affected areas along the north bank of the Yellow River to Shouzhang. He also convened the county magistrates of Puxian, Fanxian, Dong'a, Shouzhang, and Yanggu to inquire about the disaster situation. Today (the tenth) at 2:00 PM, he returned to Jinan from the north bank. At 9:10 PM that evening, he took the Pinghu train to Xuzhou and then went to Lanfeng and Kaocheng in Henan.</p>
<p>When Mr. Mei went to the north bank of the Yellow River to investigate the disaster, he departed by special train at 8:00 AM on the morning of the ninth. At 8:15 AM, the special train crossed the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge, seeing that the Yellow River had receded significantly, but the flow was still strong. Originally, it was planned to change to a car on the north bank of Luokou, but because the Yellow River mud was everywhere after the river receded, it was inconvenient to walk, so the special train went north again. At 8:40 AM, it arrived at the Sangzidian Station, where it changed to a car and proceeded westward. There were four long-distance cars prepared by the Department of Construction, and one private car of Li Shuchun, which Mei, Li, and Xin shared. The remaining four cars were shared by the accompanying personnel. At 1:00 PM, it arrived at the Xiangshan car station, got off the car to rest briefly, and had lunch. After lunch, it got on the car again and proceeded. At 2:00 PM, it passed Taochengbu, and at 4:00 PM, it arrived at Shouzhang County. When passing Taochengbu, the overflowing water was seen from a distance, still rushing into the Yellow River, the current was still very rapid, and the previous situation could be imagined. Continuing westward, south of the Jin embankment and north of the river, there was a vast expanse of water without any boundaries. All villages and fields were completely submerged. What could be seen were only a few rooftops and treetops floating on the water. It is said that the current water level has significantly decreased, and before it decreased, it could be imagined. Even now, the water depth is still more than one zhang. The lives of the victims are truly unbearable. Except for those who were drowned and washed away without any trace and cannot be proven, according to what can be seen now, the rooftops and mountain peaks have become the victims' happy nests, exposing them to the night dew, crying from hunger and cold, and the sounds can be heard in the fields. Everywhere one looks, there are scenes of property being destroyed and families scattered, which cannot be counted. The daily lives of the victims are mostly filled with eating leaves and bark. When one hears that relief is being distributed, it is like a drop in the bucket, not enough to help. They can only eat their fill once and then go hungry all day long. This situation is truly unbearable and cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shouzhang, the county magistrate Zhuang Shouchong led the county government and various agencies, representatives of the victims, and Yang Jifeng, the county magistrate of Yanggu, An Maolong, the county magistrate of Dong'a, and Zhou Junying, the county magistrate of Fanxian, because they received a telegram from Li Shuchun, the head of the Department of People's Affairs, from Jining, and rushed to Shouzhang to greet them. The county magistrate of Puxian was unable to arrive due to an emergency. Mei, Li, Xin, and others got off the car outside the city, walked into the city with the county magistrates, and went to the county government. After a brief rest, Mei immediately inquired about the disaster situation from the county magistrates. According to the report of Zhuang Shouchong, the county magistrate of Shouzhang, the county has ten districts, all of which have been affected by the disaster. A total of over 600 hectares in the five districts on the south bank were flooded, with more than 90 villages and over 4,800 households, affecting over 25,000 people. On the north bank, more than 2,300 hectares in the five districts were flooded, affecting more than 290 villages, over 15,600 households, and over 81,000 people, with losses of more than 54 million yuan. In total, all ten districts of the county were flooded with more than 2,900 hectares, affecting 385 villages, more than 20,400 households, and over 106,000 people, with losses of more than 6.4 million yuan. He continued, saying that the water in the county, after the Yellow River breached its banks at Erfenzhuang in Hebei Province, flowed into the Qingshui River and Ji River, which run through the sixth and eighth districts of the county, and spread in all directions, flooding all the fields and crops. Countless houses collapsed, and fertile land was turned into a swamp. It was found that the two rivers came from Yuncheng and entered Dongping Lake through Guanxian. Therefore, the disaster was lighter in previous years, but now the lakeshore along Dongping has been built into a dam, and the water coming from the south cannot enter the lake and cannot be discharged, resulting in flooding and the development of a disaster area. To this day, the water level is still rising, and there is no hope of sowing wheat. The victims have all fled, and the severity of the disaster in the future is unknown. Then, An Maolong, the county magistrate of Dong'a, reported that 42 townships in the county were flooded, a total of 203 villages, affecting 11,866 households and 71,334 people, flooding 2,422.1007 hectares of land. The water depth in all the flooded areas was 7 or 8 chi. The victims did not plant wheat last year, and this year's autumn harvest was also flooded. There is a shortage of food, and the victims are all crying out for food. Although the Provincial Relief Committee has provided relief, it is only a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Please provide relief as soon as possible. Next, Yang Jifeng, the county magistrate of Yanggu, reported that one-quarter of the county was flooded, a total of 3, 5, 6, and 3 districts. The third district has more than 3,400 victims, 40 hectares of flooded land, countless houses collapsed, and losses of more than 35,000 yuan. The fifth district has more than 2,000 victims, more than 500 hectares of flooded land, more than 3,000 houses, and losses of more than 77 million yuan. The sixth district has more than 18,000 victims, more than 100 hectares of flooded land, more than 4,000 houses, and losses of more than 600,000 yuan. Then, Zhou Junying, the county magistrate of Fanxian, reported that the first district of the county was flooded with 820 hectares of land, 75 villages, a total of 2,220 households, affecting 15,320 people (one death), with losses of about 1.2 million yuan. The third district was flooded with 600 hectares of land, 63 villages, a total of 2,100 households, affecting 14,830 people (two deaths), with losses of about 900,000 yuan. The third district was flooded with 420 hectares of land, 45 villages, a total of 1,090 households, affecting 13,710 people (three deaths). The fourth district was flooded with 1,600 hectares of land, 257 villages, a total of 4,300 households, affecting 49,310 people (six deaths), with losses of 1.6 million yuan. In total, 340 villages, 10,052 households, and a total of 93,171 victims were affected, with 13 deaths and losses of more than 4.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>The representatives of the victims in Shouzhang County, Ma Guishan, Shi Xingmo, Sun Baoshan, Chen Xixian, Tan Xuekong, Cao Yalin, Tong Xianzhang, Meng Guangrong, Yue Shuxun, Yuan Dianyuan, Li Yantian, Yue Chongjue, Jiang Zunhui, and Liu Xiqin, wrote a letter to Mr. Mei at the county government, stating, "Since the Yellow River breached its banks at Shitouzhuan in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, the water flowed eastward with great force. The county is low-lying and is located in its path. In a few days, the water depth reached from one zhang to four zhang. The number of people and livestock washed away is countless. The affected area in the county stretches 80 li diagonally from east to west and 30 li to 40 li from north to south, covering 280 villages with a population of approximately 120,000 and an area of more than 2,700 hectares. The estimated losses in the affected area are approximately 2 million yuan for fields and crops, 1.4 million yuan for collapsed houses, and over 2 million yuan for washed-away livestock and other property. The total losses on the north bank of the county are more than 5.4 million yuan. In addition, the south bank of the county has also suffered from floods. One area, from Huanghuasi to the south to Yezhuzhao, is 40 li long and 7 or 8 li wide from east to west, covering more than 50 villages, which have all been submerged. The other area, since the Erfenzhuang breach in Dongming, the water from Heze and Yuncheng flows into the Qingshui River in the territory of Shouzhang at Zhao Jiaba, flooding in all directions and submerging more than 30 villages, about 50 li long and 5 or 6 li to 10 li wide, becoming a vast expanse of water. The third area, the Yellow River water level rose and overflowed, submerging the villages along the river, about 40 li long. The losses from the flood on the south bank of the county are also estimated to be more than 1 million yuan. The total losses from the floods on the north and south banks are more than 6.4 million yuan. The facts of the floods and the amount of losses in the county are hereby presented for your review and forwarding. We also request that you provide relief and close the breach as soon as possible to help the victims. We are grateful and await your orders."</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, after Mr. Mei had completed the county magistrates' reports on the disaster situation, he went to the streets to inspect everything. Accompanied by Xin Zhujiu, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Relief Committee, and Huang, the secretary of the Shouzhang County Government, who acted as a guide, he first visited the prison and then the streets. Mr. Mei asked the peddlers about the prices of goods and the local people's livelihood. At 7:00 PM, Mr. Mei and the county magistrates went to the county's first elementary school for dinner. That night, all the disaster investigators stayed at the school. Mr. Mei, having received reports from the county magistrates about the disaster situation, returned to Jinan on the tenth. In the morning, after a light breakfast, he left Shouzhang by car at 5:30 AM. At 1:05 PM, he arrived in Jinan. At 3:00 PM, he met with Han Fuqu at the provincial government. Mr. Mei told people that the disaster situation in Shandong was very serious and had been reported to the central government. He would take the train to Xuzhou and then to Kaifeng to investigate the disaster situation that night (the tenth) at 9:10 PM. (Tenth)</p>
<h3 id="e90">The People of Xiaodang Oppose Blocking the Dasha River Mouth <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Fengpei Counties Have Sent Teams to Measure and Estimate the Work</p>
<p>Xiaodang Representatives Petition the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Stop It</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Last month, the Yellow River water from eastern Henan entered Xuzhou and flowed eastward along the old channel. When it reached Gaozhai on the eastern border of Dangshan, it turned north into the Dasha River, flowing backward into Fengpei to enter Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes. Therefore, the amount of water flowing eastward along the old channel was reduced. In addition, with the obstruction of the Erba dams, Xiaotong was not affected by the floods. Therefore, the four counties of Fengpei, Xiaodang are in a conflicting position of interests regarding the Yellow River water. The counties of Tong, Pi, Sui, and Su are behind them. If the Yellow River water flows eastward from the old channel by breaching the Erba dams, it must pass through eastern Dangshan and northern Xiao before reaching the territory of Tong, and only after passing through Tong can it reach Pi, Sui, and Su again. If it completely enters Weishan Lake from the Dasha River, it must enter the canal from the river to reach Pi and Su counties. The Jingshan and Bulao Rivers in Tongshan, which are connected to Weishan Lake, must overflow to the south for the lake water to flow into them. Now, people in Fengpei, suffering from the floods of the Yellow River, intend to block the mouth of the Dasha River to restrain the flow of water to the north, while simultaneously dredging and releasing the Erba dams so that the Yellow River water still flows eastward along the old channel. In this way, Fengpei can be guaranteed safety. Teams have already been sent to the Dasha River mouth and the Erba dam area to measure and estimate the work. People in Xiaodang were alarmed upon hearing the news. Because the old Yellow River has been silted up for a long time, the Dasha River is the path the Yellow River took when it breached its banks and flowed north in the past. The riverbed is particularly lower than the old Yellow River. Forcibly blocking the low-lying river mouth and opening the high-lying dams is somewhat akin to shifting the water to harm others. Furthermore, if the water flows north from the Dasha River, there is still Weishan Lake to store it. If it flows eastward along the old channel, it will inevitably overflow and have nowhere to return. Therefore, not only can the Erba dams not be opened, but the Dasha River mouth cannot be forcibly blocked. As a result, they concentrated their efforts to defend the Erba dams and sent representatives to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters, and the Commissioner's Office of the Twelfth District to request that they be ordered to stop it. Upon receiving the petition, Commissioner She Nianci believed that the dredging and blocking of waterways was related to the entire district and that it was necessary to coordinate to avoid disputes. He immediately ordered Yang Liang, the county magistrate of Fengxian, and Hu Zhaohe, the county magistrate of Peixian, to prohibit the people from blocking the mouth of the Dasha River and wait for the report to be submitted to the provincial government for review and handling. The people of Fengpei, believing that the Gaozhai and Erba dams were all within the territory of Dangshan, could not meddle in the affairs of others with the strength of the two counties alone. Therefore, they invited people from Dangyi to a meeting in Fengxian. People from Dangyi refused to go, believing that if the Erba dams were dredged and released, the eastern districts of Dangdong would inevitably suffer from floods, followed by Xiaotong. They contacted people in northern Xiao, who in turn contacted people in eastern Tong, and unanimously advocated opposition. The people along the Binhe River in Dangxiao, hearing that the people of Fengpei were preparing to block the river mouth and breach the dams with armed force, were also alarmed and gathered armed forces to defend themselves, prepared to fight to the death. Commissioner She, believing that the location of the dispute between the four counties was all in Dangshan, immediately sent personnel to Dangshan to investigate and strictly ordered the counties to avoid disputes and await a coordinated solution. If the Yellow River were to change its course, there would be no reason to return to the old channel in the Xuzhou area. The old channel has been silted up for a long time and is much higher than other fields. This time, the flooding in the Xuzhou area was caused by the breach and overflow of the river. Preventing breaches and floods is fundamentally linked to the closure of the breaches in western Henan and Shandong. The flood control of each county is a temporary measure. The fundamental water conservancy problem in peacetime is still to dredge the rivers so that each river flows smoothly and storage and discharge are appropriate, which is enough to eliminate floods and develop water conservancy. Attached is the petition of the representatives of Xiaodang, "We present this to prevent people from harming others, gathering crowds to demonstrate, and the situation is urgent. We hope you will review and quickly stop it to avoid bloodshed and relieve the people. We secretly investigated that in the first year of Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty, the north bank of the Yellow River collapsed in Dangjing Panlongji, pouring into Fengpei (the people of Fengpei commonly call it the Dasha River) Nanyang Zhaoyang Weishan lakes. At that time, the flood was torrential, and the riverbed was more than twelve li wide. The old Yellow River was turned over because of the accumulation of abandoned sand, which was more than one zhang higher than the newly rushed riverbed in Fengpei. There are Erba dams and Ying Shui dams in the east, and the terrain is even higher. Therefore, this time the Yellow River flooded to Panlongji east of Gaozhai, and still followed the old road of Fengpei into the lake. Water nature takes the lower place, and the terrain makes it. However, the people of Fengpei have come up with a strange idea, wanting to move the water that is lower and put it on the stop. Yesterday, they actually took a survey team of several people and two or thirty police officers, from Dangjing, along the Panlongji, and along the Erba dams to conduct on-site surveys, allocating 20,000 low-ranking workers to build dams to block the river mouth entering Fengpei, and to open the Ying Shui dam south of the Erba dam to allow the flooded Yellow River water to be introduced into the territory of Xiaotong to avoid harming Fengpei. It is also proposed to station the police groups of the two counties such as Ji, with 10,000 guns, to be stationed for security south of the Erba dams in Dangjing. It is also proposed to set up a construction supervision office in Gaozhai, install telephones, and lay electric lights, and construction will begin soon. The villages heard the news, running and sweating, indignant. Moreover, since the Yellow River moved north, the riverbed has become fertile land, and the national treasury is not owed any silk or grain. Villages and towns are lined up along the river, such as Tangzhai in Dangzhai, Huangkou, Laongji, Haozhai in Xiao, Tongshan County Town, Xuzhou Commercial Port, and the two stations of Jinpu Longhai, all located on the south bank of the old Yellow River. If this water transfer plan of Fengpei is successful, all important cities and towns and transportation routes will be in turmoil and shock every day. As for the riverbed entering Fengpei, the terrain is low-lying, the riverbed is wide and deep, and the water coming from the upper reaches goes straight to the lakes, like a waterfall, and does not harm the fields, villages, and towns. This is evident from the fact that the Yellow River water flows north into Fengpei and does not flow south into Xiaotong. However, the people of Fengpei insist on making the water that does no harm to themselves harmful to others. The representatives cannot understand this. In order to protect their lives and property, the people can only wait with weapons, just waiting for a firefight. In addition to the public presentation, we hereby present the facts. We hope that you will quickly stop the bloodshed and relieve the people. We are eagerly waiting for your orders." (September 11)</p>

Officials from the Commander-in-Chief's Camp, the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and its affiliated agencies, as well as staff members from various public organizations in Nanchang City, participated in the ceremony. The rostrum was set up at the southeast end of the airport, with a horizontal banner made of white bamboo cloth with the words "Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Construction of Nanchang Airport by All Circles of the Jiangxi Provincial Capital in Cooperation with the Suppression of Bandits." At around 8:00 AM, Qin Le opened the meeting, and Xiong Shihui served as the chairman. He first reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that the Red bandits are a fatal wound to the nation's lifeline, and the men, women, old, and young of the province have suffered terribly from the Red disaster, so they all hope that the Red bandits will be eliminated as soon as possible. However, whether the Red bandits can be eliminated as soon as possible depends on whether our cooperative suppression work to relieve ourselves of our own pain is tense or not. In the military suppression of the Red bandits, the air force accounts for one-third of the strength of the navy and army. The central government has sent a large number of capable aircraft to Gan, and everyone should work together to complete this airfield as soon as possible. Then, Hu Jiayi, the director of the Highway Bureau, reported on the construction methods. After the report, Xiong instructed each agency to assign one person to direct and maintain order during work. Then, led by Xiong Shihui, the staff of each agency, one team after another, carrying the shovels, hoes, baskets, and shoulder poles prepared by the Highway Bureau, went to the side of the small hill next to the venue and worked simultaneously with over ten thousand civilian workers around the area. They dispersed after two hours (September 11).</p>

<p>In the past, Punan, Shanyang, and other areas of this county were occupied and disturbed by the Communist Party led by Li Yi'e. The provincial government dispatched provincial police teams to Songjiang to join the local army, police, and the Fourth Anti-Smuggling Brigade in a joint suppression. At that time, the residence of Wang Meixi, who was wanted by the province, was burned down during the joint suppression by land and water forces. Last year, Wang Meixi was ordered by the province to have his wanted status revoked and returned to his hometown. He hired lawyer Zhu Fang to sue Pan Meiting, the former head of the Fourth Anti-Smuggling Brigade, in the county court, alleging that he had ordered his troops to set fire to Wang Meixi's residence and should be held liable for compensation, requesting damages of over 18,000 yuan. After repeated summons and interrogations by the court, Pan Meiting stated that he was participating in the joint suppression in a different area and did not pass through this route. He was accompanied by the administrative inspector Zhou Mingqi, and they rested at Zhang Pengzhou's home. The facts were all there. Zhou Mingqi also appeared in court to testify. After the debate concluded, the court announced its verdict on the 11th, rejecting the plaintiff's claim.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Suspicious Gunshot Wound to Li Xu Shi <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>At 3:30 AM on the 12th, a gunshot was suddenly heard at the west entrance of Xiaoshu Lane outside Changmen. Police officers on duty rushed to investigate and found Xu Shi, the wife of Li Shuangxi, who lived there, lying injured in front of her door. A bullet had entered her left breast and exited her shoulder, causing a very critical condition. According to Liu Shi, the wife of Lu Sanlong, who lived in a nearby shack, their shack was being repaired, and the couple was leaning against the door when a thief broke in and stole a package of clothing from a wooden box. They chased and caught up with the thief with the help of neighbor Li Silou, but the thief pulled out a pistol and fired before escaping. Li Xu Shi happened to be watching the commotion in front of her door and was hit by a stray bullet. However, the case is highly suspicious because the victim, Lu Sanlong, has no valuable possessions, so why would a thief with a pistol target him? Furthermore, a new leather shoe was left behind. The injured Li Xu Shi has been sent to Gengsheng Hospital, but she is unable to speak due to the severity of her injuries. The responsible Public Security Bureau is investigating the truth.</p>

<p>Qian Zuoyi Released on Bail Awaiting Investigation</p>
<p>Qian Zuoyi, the former magistrate of Rugao County, was sued for restricting freedom. Because the summons could not be served, the court's prosecutor's office sent a letter to the provincial government requesting his detention if he arrived in the province for investigation. The provincial government ordered all counties to arrest him and bring him to justice. Upon hearing the news, Qian voluntarily came to the province to surrender and defend himself. The court opened a trial yesterday, with Qian, Chen Dong, and Chief Zhou of the Rugao County Government appearing in court. The prosecutor carefully investigated and interrogated them for a long time. As a result, he was released on bail to await further investigation. After Qian left, he requested the provincial government to cancel the arrest warrant.</p>

<p>Two Students Disappear Simultaneously</p>
<p>Liu Pingjiang, a native of Yixing County and former county magistrate, resides on the bank in the city. After leaving his official career, he served as the director of general affairs at the Provincial Public Education Institute in Sheqiao, Wuxi. His wife, Mrs. So-and-so, had a son and a daughter. The eldest daughter, Minghuan, is a student at Zhenhua Girls' High School in Suzhou. The son, Xingji, is 18 years old and graduated from the Provincial Normal Junior High School in Wuxi last semester. Mrs. So-and-so passed away a few years ago, and Liu remarried Zhang Sheng, the director of moral education at the Suzhou Women's Normal School. Zhang served as the principal of Jingzhi Girls' School in Wuxi this year. The Liu family's life is extremely comfortable. Xingji is served by servants and enjoys a life of ease. When Xingji was at school, he was admired by teachers and students for his intelligence and wrote many works. However, he had a melancholy and eccentric personality. He believed that going to university would create a class of highly educated idlers, so he took a passive attitude towards subjects he considered unnecessary. However, the school authorities often attached great importance to what Xingji considered unnecessary. Therefore, after graduating last semester, he failed to be admitted to Changzhou High School, Soochow Academy, Suzhou School, and others. He was finally admitted to the Suzhou Art Academy, but his family was very dissatisfied, and Xingji was constantly depressed and unhappy. He spent his days wandering on the park road, pacing in the cinema, or roaming near graveyards, filled with melancholy thoughts. Day after day, his appearance grew haggard, and his mind became distracted. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, he took his everyday clothes and seven or eight silver dollars for spending money and left home. Upon discovering this, his parents immediately sent telegrams and searched everywhere, but there was no news or trace of him. Liu Pingjiang was heartbroken at the loss of his son in his old age, and his nerves were greatly affected. To their surprise, the day before yesterday, they suddenly discovered that Xingji's best friend, Kong Deyang, had also disappeared at the same time. Kong is from Zhutang Town in Jiangyin. His father, Kong Jinquan, is also from a moderately wealthy family. Yesterday, Kong's elder brother, Kong Dexing, came to Wuxi to search for him after hearing the news, but there was also no trace of him. It is thought that Liu and Kong have embarked on a wandering journey, but it is unknown where they are. Currently, the families of the two students have entrusted people to search in Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places, hoping to find them.</p>

The daughter had been working as a domestic helper in Zhenjiang. She returned home a month ago and suddenly fell ill and died within a few days. Zhang noticed purple marks on her daughter's fingers and suspected foul play, so she came to the city and filed a lawsuit in court, accusing Jiao Baolu and his elder brother Baolu of abuse and murder, requesting the dispatch of personnel for inspection.</p>

<p>The Collapse of the Zhanglu Dike in Songxia Causes Disaster</p>
<p>For nearly a week in this county, there has been incessant high winds and torrential rain. The Cao'e River, swollen by seventy tributaries, has caused the tide to rise and flood to a height of several meters. More than twenty villages along the river, located in low-lying areas, have had their crops and by-products submerged, resulting in substantial losses. The old Qiutang Dike in Zhanglu Village, Songxia, has been in disrepair for years, and the dike body was not strong to begin with. Continued erosion by the raging waves caused it to collapse suddenly a few days ago. The floodwaters inundated more than a thousand acres of sandy land, washing away all the crops planted there. The farmers are all crying out in distress.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I recently read a section in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 10th about the Director of the Wuxi Sulfur and Nitrate Bureau being sued, which is not consistent with the facts. I have held this position for a year now, and I have always aimed to balance the interests of the public and businesses. The inspectors I have appointed are only a small number, not excessive. Recently, the production of fireworks by Hui Xuyuan, Gu Rongmao, Xu Yuanmao, and others was suspected of using smuggled nitrate. Nitrate is the raw material for manufacturing dangerous goods, and the government has long explicitly prohibited anyone from privately selling or stockpiling it, with strict regulations. Since I learned that these merchants were suspected of smuggling, I naturally sent inspectors to investigate, but there was no act of searching through boxes and chests. What your newspaper reported is absolutely untrue. As for the Fireworks Industry Association, it should have applied to the bureau, but its letter was in the form of an order, which was unacceptable, so I rejected it as being irregular. My headquarters has now sent Commissioner Wang Zhixiang to Wuxi to investigate the matter thoroughly. Right and wrong will be easily judged. I respectfully request that this letter be published in the "Letter to the Editor" column to clarify the facts. With best wishes, I remain,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Fu Huanzeng, Director of the Wuxi Branch of the Sulfur and Nitrate Bureau.</p>

<p>Chairman Song Continued to Discuss Relief Measures Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, convened Zeng Rongpu, Director of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Office and Chief of the General Affairs Group, Xi Dejiong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group, and Edward Anner, Chairman of the China International Famine Relief Commission, at the Finance Department's Shanghai Office on West Ames Road to discuss relief efforts for the flood disaster in Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces. At 4:00 PM, Xi Dejiong, Zeng Rongpu, and others continued to discuss disaster relief matters at the association's office on the Bund, No. 6, and dispersed at 5:00 PM. Xi will leave for Hongqiao Airport at 6:00 AM this morning to take a Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane to Beijing. Standing Committee member and Director of the Health Group Liu Ruiheng, and Director of the Work Relief Group Zhou Xiangxian, will board the plane in Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Departing This Morning <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Yellow River Flood Disaster Area Situation Committee, in order to understand the actual situation in the disaster area, has appointed Xi Dejiong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group, Zhou Xiangxian, Director of the Work Relief Group, Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Health Group, and a foreign relief expert to inspect the disaster area. Yesterday morning, Xi Dejiong told a Central News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>"Our committee has chartered a plane from Eurasia Aviation Corporation to inspect the disaster area. I will leave Shanghai for Beijing at 6:00 AM tomorrow (the 13th). After a short stay in Beijing, I will fly to the Jinan area with Directors Liu and Zhou, who are currently in Beijing, and a foreign expert to inspect the area. We have decided to stay in Jinan for one day. The next morning, we will fly from Jinan to the Kaifeng area to inspect the area. We will contact local authorities along the way to discuss relief matters. The scheduled trip will be four days." Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, said that the plane chartered by the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing at 6:00 AM tomorrow and fly from Beijing to Jinan at 8:00 AM. The itinerary will be determined after arriving in Jinan.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Scheduled Itinerary <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>At 8:00 AM, fly north from Beijing, detouring through Tongshan, Fengxian, Pei County, Jiaxiang, Dancheng, Juye, Shouzhang, Yanggu, and other counties to inspect the flood situation and disaster conditions. They will also lead technicians from the Army Survey Bureau and Western experts to take photographs along the way. In the afternoon, they will arrive in Jinan to discuss relief matters with local authorities. Tomorrow (the 14th), they will fly south from Jinan, passing through Pu County, Heze, and the disaster areas of Hebei Province, and arrive in Kaifeng to discuss relief efforts with the Henan provincial authorities. The day after tomorrow (the 15th), they will take off from Kaifeng, first inspect the Bianxi and Xingze counties, then fly east, passing through Chenliu, Lanfeng, and Kaocheng, and return to Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Government Appropriation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Zeng Rongpu, Director of the General Affairs Office of the committee, yesterday. According to Zeng, the Yellow River flood has affected almost four provinces: Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu. The Yellow River Relief Committee has been established, and the internal organization is largely in place. The government has allocated four million yuan for expenses. However, everything still needs to await a thorough investigation of the disaster area before detailed statistics are compiled and submitted to the government for approval. Whether this is sufficient or not is difficult to determine at this time. The Shanghai office is located in the National Economic Council on the Bund.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Area Affected by Flooding <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Subsequently, Li, Director of the Technical Group of the Engineering Department of the Economic Council, said that he saw a report in the newspaper today that the Yellow River Conservancy Commission had entrusted the Aviation Survey Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters to conduct an aerial survey. As a result:</p>
<p>The area affected by the Yellow River flood is 6 million square meters. However, the area we obtained is 34,432 square kilometers, including 6,720 square kilometers in Henan Province, 12,160 square kilometers in Hebei Province, 14,562 square kilometers in Shandong Province, and Jiangsu, which is relatively small, with 990 square kilometers. The area affected by the Yellow River flood this time is indeed very extensive, unprecedented in decades. However, the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee is already planning relief efforts. Relief will be handled by the Disaster Relief Group, while the construction of dikes and dams along the river will be handled by the Work Relief Group. Director Xi and others will fly to the disaster area for inspection tomorrow (today).</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Cause of the Yellow River Disaster <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Yong, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Engineering Department, said that Director Xi (Dejiong) and others will inspect the disaster area, first going to Jinan, as it is very convenient to go from there to Henan and Hebei. The Yangtze River flood this year did not cause a disaster, entirely due to the dike construction and heightening carried out by the Economic Council after the great flood of 1931. Otherwise, this year's flood, although not as extensive as the devastation of 1931, would have turned at least dozens of counties in the provinces along the river, such as Jiangxi and Hubei, into swamps. As for the cause of the Yellow River flood this time, it was due to the high water level in the lower reaches and the siltation in the middle reaches, so the upper reaches, once the water arrived, had no way to discharge it, resulting in a breach. Furthermore, the breach in Lanfeng was originally the entrance to the silted Yellow River. A dam was built there before, but this time, the breach was unable to be stopped by the dam, and it was washed away, causing the Yellow River's water to flood the provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong along the old course. Director Xi's inspection of the disaster area will be quick, probably completed and returned in at most a week. Director Xi is responsible for disaster relief, such as relief, accommodation, and setting up porridge kitchens. The preparation of 100,000 sets of cotton clothes is the responsibility of the General Affairs Group, but I am not aware of the details. The Henan Supervision Office of our department was established earlier. After the Yellow River disaster occurred, our department sent two engineers, Tang Shangsong and Zhang Chongji, to assist in the rescue.</p>

<p>Malais Refutes Japanese Newspaper's News</p>
<p>The China Press reports that the French Concession authorities have refused to allow the Anti-War Congress to be held in the Concession. The French Consul-General, Meyer, yesterday (the 11th) replied to Lord Marley, stating that all political gatherings within the French Concession, regardless of their nature, are prohibited. Therefore, Lord Marley is now requesting the authorities of the International Settlement to allow him to hold a meeting within the Settlement. As for the attitude of the National Government in Nanjing, according to Marley, it is still undecided. He has sent a letter to the National Government and is awaiting a reply. Marley also responded to the report in the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Daily News that the current anti-war movement is engaged in anti-German and anti-Japanese activities, saying that the anti-war movement and the opposition to the National Socialist movement are completely two different organizations and are absolutely unrelated. Major countries now have committees to help refugees under National Socialism, and these committees have absolutely nothing to do with the Anti-War Congress. As for the activities of the anti-war movement, they are not aimed at a single country, let alone against Japan. The Japanese newspaper's statement is absolutely unfounded. Regarding the Japanese newspaper's claim that Britain is using the anti-war movement to carry out an anti-Japanese policy, Marley stated that although the anti-war movement has the support of a majority of Labor Party members, he has never received the support of the British government. Whether Britain actually has an anti-Japanese policy is also questionable.</p>

<p>Since being ordered to mint new coins, the Central Mint has produced 2.26 million yuan using old molds and 9.26 million yuan using new molds by the end of August. These coins have been inspected and certified as qualified by the Review Committee and delivered to the Central Bank for issuance. To ensure public confidence, they were sent to the Philadelphia and San Francisco mints in the United States for analysis. All were within the legal standards, that is, the tolerance between the weight and fineness of each coin and the legal standard (each coin weighing 26.6971 grams, containing 88% silver and 12% copper, including 23.493448 grams of pure silver) does not exceed three thousandths. The Review Committee submitted the analysis results from the two US mints to the Ministry of Finance, which issued an order of commendation the day before yesterday, stating: "The presentation and tables are all noted. After examining the analysis results of the new coins minted by the factory and sent to the Philadelphia and San Francisco mints in the United States, all are within the legal standards. This shows that the director of the factory is effective in his supervision, and all employees are able to perform their duties. Deeply commend, in addition to filing the analysis table and publishing it in the Gazette, this order is issued."</p>

The number of people who have joined as founders has reached 166, and the number of people who have joined as sponsors has reached 75. The total amount of shares that have been subscribed is 45,100 yuan. It is hoped that all founders will sign the number of shares they have subscribed for and prepare to proceed with the registration procedures. Then Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Wu Zhihao, Cao Yunxiang, Li Zushing, Wang Jie'an, Li Wanli, and others gave speeches in succession. The speeches and the number of shares subscribed on the spot are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Wang Xiaolai's Speech <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>"The current Chinese social economy has fallen into an extremely dangerous situation. It is necessary to provide relief. To put it simply, the purpose of launching the Production and Sales United Company is to promote national products. The two words 'production and sales' may seem novel at first glance, but they are actually plain and unremarkable. I have always considered Chinese merchants to value morality. For example, when opening a store, they gather a number of people to plan the development of commerce, and they will not succeed unless they share the same goals and values. There is also the so-called 'credibility in commerce.' All merchants must be credible. The Production and Sales United Company gathers the strength of many people to seek cooperation in production and promotion, and cooperation in economy and talent. What is it if not sharing the same goals and values and conducting business with credibility? If the products of the factory are shoddy, it is a breach of faith. A breach of faith is injustice. Once credibility is lost, sales will stagnate, and failure will follow before the end of the day. The so-called Production and Sales United Company contains the meaning of sharing the same goals and values and conducting business with credibility. Therefore, the products of the factory must be excellent in order to win the trust of consumers. Production and promotion are mutually dependent, like the arms helping each other. Only then can there be hope for development. Today, all the gentlemen present are giants in the industry. I hope you will give more guidance and work together to solve the people's livelihood problems and make our China become strong and prosperous and survive in the world."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Wu Zhihao's Speech <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>"I have always considered that the governments of various countries provide detailed equipment for the encouragement of industry, such as the implementation of protective tariffs and the stipulation of export bonuses. However, our country is not only unable to implement protective tariffs due to the restrictions of various countries, but also has never seen export bonuses in laws and regulations. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and markets are declining, the government should come forward to organize production and sales matters to provide relief for the livelihoods of the majority of people and cultivate the nation's vitality. However, our government is in a time of internal and external troubles, and its finances are extremely exhausted. Therefore, it has been unable to provide sufficient assistance. This matter is now being undertaken by people from the industrial and financial circles in Shanghai. In the future, after the company is established, I hope that the government will provide assistance, such as reducing taxes and rewarding exports. These are all urgent matters to alleviate the people's livelihood and promote national products."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Cao Yunxiang's Speech <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Cao stated that the founders of the China Products Sales United Company are all experienced businessmen. In the future, attention should be paid to sales talent. Commercial competition has many methods, but they should be directed outward, not inward. He has often seen that in the past, Chinese businesses lacked trade association organizations and were like a plate of loose sand. Not only was there no unity, but there was also jealousy among competitors. Anyone who possessed some skill or wisdom was unwilling to share it with others for mutual study and discussion. Their vision for foreign trade was shallow, only thinking about undermining each other. Without the leadership of trade associations, the results were often failures. He recalled that when he was in New York in his early years, he saw a Chinese merchant bringing tea bricks from Hankou to America for sale. The New York tea merchants were greatly alarmed and tried to prevent the sales. Later, the tea merchants contributed 100,000 yuan as a birthday gift to the Chinese merchant. The merchant, seeing profit and forgetting righteousness, suddenly obtained a large sum of money and abandoned his obligation to promote tea bricks in America. He used the money for gambling and extravagant eating. Later, this person disappeared. Also, when he was in Germany, he saw a Chinese merchant coming to Germany to sell silk. The German silk merchants agreed not to trade with him. The merchant had no choice but to auction off the silk at a low price and spent the money lavishly. The result was also a great failure. Therefore, he believes that selling goods is not an easy task, especially selling to foreign countries, because foreign merchants are often able to not be greedy for small profits and have strong solidarity, unlike Chinese merchants who only seek profit and disregard everything else.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Li Wanli's Speech <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The China National Products Sales United Company is a product of the shift from "free economy" to controlled economy, which is now a consistent and universal trend in modern nation-building. The so-called controlled economy means production for consumers. What consumers need is what producers prepare. The entire production sector targets the entire consumer base, focusing solely on increasing production to meet consumer needs, without worrying about sales or competition among peers, in order to achieve universal sales. The aim is to ensure that all Chinese people use Chinese goods, while preventing foreign goods from being sold domestically, and then promoting Chinese goods abroad. By understanding the availability of products in various regions, and using wholesale and retail methods, the goods will be transferred to local businesses and shops for resale to the general public. In the future, each business and shop will be able to post a slogan at the entrance: "This business and shop sells only Chinese goods. Everything you buy and eat here is undoubtedly Chinese goods." This is indeed an advertisement for the production sector. The significance of the China National Products Sales United Company is so great. It is hoped that both the production and consumption sides will join together and realize it immediately. This is not only saving the country but also saving ourselves, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Eager Subscribers <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After the speech, more than thirty or forty people participated in the initiation and sponsorship on the spot. Jiang Yiping, one of the initiators, subscribed to 10,000 yuan worth of shares.

<h3 id="e123">Our Country Prepares to Participate in the International Press Conference <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Government Representative Appointed: Qiu Zheng'ou　　Press Representative Under Discussion</p>
<p>The Second International Press Conference is scheduled to be held in Madrid, Spain, on October 17th. The Spanish government has formally invited our country to participate. Currently, the government representative has been appointed by the central government as Qiu Zheng'ou. The press representative has not yet been determined. The Shanghai press community generally suggests that Ge Gongzhen, who is currently in Europe, represent the Chinese press community at the conference. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Daily Press Association held a special meeting for this matter and invited Xiao Tongzi, Secretary of the Central Propaganda Committee, to participate. It was decided to send a telegram to the press communities in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places, formally proposing to entrust Mr. Ge to represent them at the conference.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daily Press Association will also prepare a letter of authorization and send it to the press communities in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places for joint signature and then send it to Mr. Ge as proof. The report and proposals to be submitted to the International Press Conference are also being discussed and prepared.</p>
<h3 id="e124">National Federation of Commerce Surveys Shanghai Industries After the War <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Business Greatly Reduced... Many Closures</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the January 28th Incident following the September 18th Incident, all industries across the country suffered great losses, which have not yet been recovered. Shanghai, being located in the war zone, suffered even greater losses. Therefore, the National Federation of Commerce has compiled the situation of Shanghai's business scene before and after the war, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Financial Industry <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The financial industry in this city has not yet fully recovered from the losses suffered in the war. In January of the 21st year, the city's cash reserve was only 73,000,000 yuan, and the silver reserve was only 61,350,000 taels. By the end of that year, the cash reserve was 242,000,000 yuan, an increase of 70,000,000 yuan compared to before the war, and the silver reserve was 13,600,000 taels, an increase of more than double. The concentration of silver in Shanghai, due to the decline of the market, made it impossible to absorb. In April of this year, the tael was abolished and the yuan was adopted. In July, the Central Mint began to mint new coins. By the end of July, the number of silver dollars in the city had increased to 275,480,000 yuan and 140,792,000 taels, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. Although the financial industry suffered less than other industries in the January 28th Incident, the banks and native banks that were directly affected by the war and closed down include Dada Bank, Zhengda Bank, Changsheng Native Bank, Yichun Native Bank, Defeng Native Bank, Yuansheng Native Bank, Huichang Native Bank, Yuanshun Native Bank, and Yuanda Native Bank. Those that were reorganized due to the war include China Industrial Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, Futai Native Bank, Xinyu Native Bank, Renchang Native Bank, Anyu Native Bank, Hongxiang Native Bank, Shengda Native Bank, Shenyuan Native Bank, Xinkang Native Bank, and Dingsheng Native Bank. However, new establishments also include Ningbo Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank, Huifeng Bank, Tongyuan Commercial Savings Bank, Jia Hua Branch, Hua An Bank, Qianyi Silver Company, Siming Savings Society, Overseas Chinese Trust Company, and Shengchang Native Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Industry and Commerce <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>(1) Cotton Spinning Industry: The Shanghai factory's yarn production mainly relied on sales in North China. Since the fall of the Northeast, the sales of Chinese yarn factories have been declining daily, leading to overproduction. Some have implemented a system of reduced working hours, while others have requested assistance. The situation is particularly bleak, while Japanese yarn factories have been able to implement dumping. Therefore, many Chinese factories have closed down or reduced their scale. (2) Cotton Weaving Industry: During the Shanghai war, about sixteen or seventeen Chinese cotton weaving factories were destroyed. The most prosperous period for cotton cloth and foreign goods stores saw over a thousand in the city. After this blow, one-third have closed down in the past year, leaving only about six hundred. The native cloth industry has also seen a significant decrease in business due to the loss of the Northeast. Other small</p>
<p>cloth manufacturers are also barely surviving. (2) Silk Industry: There were originally 112 silk factories in the city, with 25,300 looms. Production almost completely ceased during the Shanghai Incident. About a dozen were destroyed by artillery fire. By June of last year, only 31 had resumed production. In November, with government assistance, 65 had resumed production. Two-fifths have not yet resumed production. (4) Flour Industry: The total production capacity of all flour mills in Shanghai can reach 33 million bags per year at its peak. After the war, some produced less than 10 million bags. Wheat and other grains were also affected by the situation, with 60-70% relying on foreign wheat. (5) Cigarette Industry: The Shanghai cigarette factories reached over 180 at their peak. Now only about sixty remain. Other industries are also declining year by year.</p>

<p>Preparing to Improve Factories in China</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Japanese merchants have established more than 40 yarn factories in Shanghai and other ports in China, with more than 1.7 million spindles and more than 200,000 thread spindles, producing approximately 800,000 bales of yarn and more than 10 million bolts of cloth annually. This has a significant impact on domestic yarn and cloth manufacturers. However, due to the global recession and weak purchasing power of the people, the general business situation is bleak. It is now heard that Japanese merchants, in order to win the commercial war, have decided to improve their machinery and reduce costs. Therefore, there is a comprehensive plan to uniformly convert all factories in China to new-style textile machines, with each 400 spindles requiring only one person to manage. Not only is the weaving precise, but the cost is also low, with the aim of monopolizing the Chinese textile market.</p>

<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau issued Announcement No. 170 yesterday to announce the scheduled drawing of municipal bonds, stating: "For the purpose of notification, the sixth redemption drawing of municipal bonds in this city is scheduled to be held at the Shanghai Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association at 11:00 a.m. on September 21st.

<p>Factories Actively Arranging the Venue</p>
<p>The Citywide National Products Movement Exhibition Fair, organized by the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city, has been decided to open on the 15th of this month at the Penglai Market in Ximen. More than 170 national goods factories are participating in this event, which can be called a grand event for the national goods movement in this city this year. It is learned that the determined booths have been drawn by lot the day before yesterday, and the opening date is approaching in an instant, and preparations are now being actively made to arrange them in an orderly manner.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Municipal Federation Issues Notice to Stop Counterfeiting National Products <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation National Products Movement Association has issued a notice to promote national products and stop counterfeit sales, stating: "Approved the letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Promotion of National Products Association, stating: 'It has been found that the Gongzu Socks Factory, Yingzhou, Dingxin, Junchang, Tonghe Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Sanyang, Jiuyi, Yukang Cotton Weaving Factory, Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, and Yixing Hao ten factories stole Liuma brand raw yarn from the Dakang Yarn Factory and changed it to Zhong brand of Shenxin No. 5 Factory, weaving them into goods and transporting them to various ports. The Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Regional Unified Tax Bureau has detected the conspiracy and filed a lawsuit.'" It is found that these factories have lost their conscience, seeking profit and forgetting righteousness. This behavior not only deceives the public but also destroys the national products movement. The Association, responsible for its duties, cannot remain silent. The 13th session of the 10th Joint Executive Supervisory Committee has decided to notify its members to refuse to trade with these factories and to send letters to the knitting and cotton cloth industry trade unions for the strictest and most effective disposal, as well as to send letters to the grocery industry trade unions and the First and Second Special District Citizens' General Federations to notify stores throughout the city to pay serious attention to the products of these ten factories and refuse to promote them, in order to warn unscrupulous merchants and maintain commercial reputation. It is recorded in the file. In addition to notifying all members, and notifying them separately, the corresponding record of the discussion is hereby submitted, hoping that your association will investigate and handle it, and look forward to your reply. Regarding the level of public friendship, etc., it is hereby approved. The fifth standing committee meeting decided to send letters to the district sub-associations to inform the members to investigate and handle it as a whole."</p>

<p>Mobile Police Officers Continue to Come to China</p>
<p>More than 20 warships belonging to the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet in Shanghai and the First Expeditionary Force in the Yangtze River were originally scheduled to hold a large exercise outside Wusong on the 15th. Therefore, the 27 fleet ships patrolling outside have returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the Japanese warships in the Yangtze River were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today to gather. However, because September 18th is the date of the Japanese army's invasion of Shenyang, the Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai have decided to change the date of the Shanghai Third Fleet exercise to the 18th of this month in order to show their triumph. The Japanese warships in the Yangtze River will also postpone their arrival in Shanghai by a few days. As for the review of the stationed Shanghai Marine Corps, it has already been held in the branch. It is known that 450 members of the naval regiment brought by the Chizhi warship have been added to the Shanghai Marine Corps, and the 300 members who should be transferred back have left Shanghai for Japan. As for the period after the January 28th Incident, the Japanese police authorities specially trained a kind of mobile police. The method is to transfer Japanese police officers of all levels, from middle to lower, to China in batches every month, about 30 to 40 people, to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the Chinese situation, moving and rotating in succession. On the one hand, they are continuously sent from Japan, and on the other hand, the police officers stationed in China whose terms have expired are also transferred back to their home country in succession. If this is done, in a year or two, all Japanese police officers will be completely transformed into those who are deeply aware of the Chinese situation. This mobile police force has never stopped since the January 28th Incident, and continues to be dispatched and transferred. This is also continuously happening.</p>

<p>Chuxin Strikes Again Due to the Change to a New Scale</p>
<p>The Dayangqiao Area Has Been Persuaded to Resume Work</p>
<p>The labor unrest in the silk factories has been delayed and unresolved, leading to many twists and turns. The striking workers in the Xinzha District harassed the Dayangqiao area north of the railway the day before yesterday, causing the Fengtai and other twelve factories in the area to also be affected by the strike. With the persuasion of the Fifty Trade Union, all resumed work yesterday. Only Chuxin and Yuanfeng in the Xinzha District started work yesterday, but unexpectedly, Chuxin struck again in the afternoon due to the change to a new scale. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e134">Swarming Harassment <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, about four to five hundred striking workers from the factories in the Xinzha District gathered and swarmed to harass the Dayangqiao area, damaging a lot of Fengtai's bamboo fences, causing the factory workers to lose interest in working and declare a strike. The strike spread to Fuchang, Yutai, Gongda, Tiansheng, Hongxi, Yingji, Hengcang, Xinglun, Yufeng, and other eleven silk factories at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Persuading to Start Work <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>At 4:00 a.m. this morning, the Sixth District Silk Industry Trade Union specially sent all the directors and supervisors, including Yang Gengti and Yuan Yunlong, as well as staff members Fei Guojie, etc., to the Dayangqiao Liutiaoying and Tanziwan to persuade the factories to blow their horns and start work. All the workers were also persuaded by the trade union to resume work. At the same time, in order to prevent the Xinzha workers from harassing them again, people were stationed on the main roads to dissuade them. Fortunately, no new twists and turns occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Chuxin Changes Scale <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Chuxin on Chang'an Road and Yuanfeng on Hengfeng Road in the Xinzha District resumed work yesterday because they were selling forward silk for settlement. The remaining twenty-one factories, such as Maofeng and Wuxing, did not start work because they were afraid of new twists and turns. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the Chuxin side changed the original line scale to a liang scale (the liang scale is 75% of the line scale) and did not pay the weekly bonus for last week. The factory workers believed that this move by the management violated the decisions made by the Social Bureau on July 8th and September 7th and reimplemented the new system, and they rose up in opposition. Therefore, after the meal break, they declared a strike. The trade union reported the situation and went to investigate. The management had already destroyed the scale. Fortunately, with the protection of the police, Yuanfeng was not affected.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Wages Remain the Same <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth District Silk Industry Trade Union, fearing that the workers would misunderstand again, specially wrote a wage chart this morning and posted it on the gates of each factory to reassure the workers to work. The original text reads: "The wages of female workers in the silk factories in this district will remain the same. The first-class wage is 50 cents, the weekly bonus is 20 cents, and the bonus for hard work is 20 cents. It is hoped that everyone will continue to work with peace of mind and no longer misunderstand."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Notifying All Factories <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth District Silk Industry Council, Notice No. 66, for the purpose of notification, the management suddenly changed to a production system, causing fierce opposition from the female workers,</p>
<p>and causing labor unrest. The association has already submitted a request to the Social Bureau to preside over the investigation, and the management has long been ordered not to implement it. However, the female workers have shallow knowledge and are easily incited by others, and have repeatedly failed to resume work, causing direct losses to the factory and indirectly affecting the livelihoods of the workers. Now, in order to make it easier for the female workers to understand, the staff of each factory are requested to earnestly explain to the female workers under their management, work with peace of mind, and no longer listen to rumors. They are also requested to pay attention to the actions of the female workers. If there are reactionary elements lurking in the female worker ranks, taking the opportunity to incite and incite, please report or detain them to the association, and a considerable reward will be given as an encouragement. This is hereby notified, and it is hoped that everyone will abide by it. September 12th, 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Heze Begs for Relief　　Representatives of the Shandong Heze County Flood Relief Association, Ran Fanrui, Ge Xiangyi, Guo Junqing, etc., sent a letter to the Yellow River Flood Relief Association yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, this time, the Yellow River breached in the provinces of Ji and Yu, and western Shandong was flooded. The magnitude of the flood is unprecedented, especially in Heze, which suffered the most severe damage. The water depth in the plains is four to five feet to more than one zhang. Four-fifths of the county's 1,800 villages were submerged. The new grain has not been harvested, and the old grain has been washed away by the water. According to statistics, the total loss in the county is more than 30 million yuan. There are more than 300,000 disaster victims in the county, without food, clothing, or shelter. At present, the disaster victims need food the most, followed by clothing, and then shelter. Transportation in Heze is inconvenient, and it is quite difficult to transport relief supplies purchased from afar. It has been found that the harvest in neighboring areas that have not been flooded is not very bad. It is best to purchase goods nearby or release cash to avoid the labor of transportation. The price of grain is one corner of a silver dollar, which can buy two catties of millet. The route to Heze is: first, from Ji to the west, travel more than 20 miles by land to Heshangkou, cross the Zhushui River to Xuzhuang, and then hire a rickshaw to reach the county seat via Zhifang, Dayi Ji, Shanhai, Xinji, and other villages. Second, transfer from Xuzhou to the Longhai Road to Liuhe Station, and then go through Caoxian County and Dingtao County to the county seat. This is a joint association of Shanghai charitable organizations raising emergency relief for the Yellow River flood, with a map of the disaster area attached."</p>

Upon hearing the news, the Committee for Investigating National Salvation Donations in various circles sent a special express mail telegram to the two, asking them to come to Shanghai as soon as possible so that the investigation could be completed as soon as possible. The original telegram is as follows: "Public Xia Yulin, Minister Xunjian, the various national salvation donation organizations in Shanghai are rumored to have embezzled donations, and all citizens are indignant and full of indignation. Our association has previously telegraphed the central government to send personnel for thorough investigation to clarify the truth and show great credibility. Now, seeing in the newspaper that the Executive Yuan has appointed you as special investigators, we are extremely happy. However, this matter has occurred for nearly two months, and the impact on the future of anti-Japanese donations is not small. On behalf of all citizens, we urge you to come to Shanghai as soon as possible to instruct our association to assist in the investigation and complete the mission together. We are extremely eager. The Shanghai Committee for Investigating National Salvation Donations sincerely."</p>

<p>Establish a Water Supply Office West of Xujiahui</p>
<p>Gradually Promote to Zhenru and Wusong</p>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Public Works Bureau's preparations for the Pudong Waterworks, Section Chief Zhu of the Bureau's Second Section told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the Bureau had drafted a plan in 1930, stipulating an expenditure of 600,000 yuan, and after being approved by the municipal meeting in 1931, it purchased two plots of land in Taoyuan Village, Lannidu, Pudong, for the construction of factory buildings and reservoirs. When it was in progress, the January 28th Incident happened, and it was suspended indefinitely. Now, although the Municipal Public Works Bureau is eager to continue the project, it is difficult to realize it for a while because the municipal treasury is more difficult than before. Zhu also said that in order to facilitate the water use of citizens in the section west of Xujiahui, where there is no tap water equipment, the Public Works Bureau has borrowed 15,000 yuan from the Municipal Bank to establish a water supply office for citizens to purchase. Water can be supplied in two weeks. In the future, depending on the financial resources, it will be extended to Zhenru, Wusong, and other districts, as well as Pudong, so that the Pudong water supply problem can be solved.</p>

<p>Discussing the issue of exhibiting domestic products in Zhejiang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, stating that the office of the Administrative Inspector of the Fourth Special District of Zhejiang Province had sent a letter stating that, in order to develop industry and promote domestic products in the special district, the first administrative meeting had already resolved to prepare for the establishment of the Zhejiang Province Fourth Special District Products Exhibition.  This would involve exhibition and sales. The office had also convened a meeting of responsible persons from various counties in the special district to prepare.  Preparations are now gradually being completed. It is scheduled to first convene a meeting in Yongjia on November 12, and then rotate the exhibition among various counties in the Wenzhou area. Regarding the promotion of domestic products, the Shanghai Municipal National Products Traveling Troupe exhibited and sold in Yongjia County this summer, which was quite popular locally and sales were very good. This time, the special district is holding a product exhibition in order to arouse the interest of the general public in using domestic products and to increase sales. It is very appropriate for the troupe to revisit Wenzhou to participate in the exhibition. Accordingly, the association is requested to check and forward this to the troupe. If they agree, please send personnel to contact the office in advance to facilitate the process. This is now approved. The office is deeply concerned about domestic products and spares no effort, which is admirable.  It is determined that it is necessary for the Shanghai factories to participate in the mobile exhibition of domestic products in the area again. Therefore, a joint meeting of various domestic product groups will be convened at 3:00 PM on the 16th of this month on the third floor of the exhibition hall to discuss the methods. Please be sure to send two representatives to attend on time to discuss together.</p>

<p>On the second of this month, a hurricane passed through Shanghai, causing incalculable losses to crops in Chuansha and Nanhui in Pudong, especially in Hengsha, Gaodunsha, Yuanyuansha, and other areas under the jurisdiction of Chuansha, which suffered the most severe damage. When the storm surge arrived, houses were destroyed and people and animals were drowned. Local officials and gentry, after receiving the report, went by boat to survey the damage and saw disaster victims everywhere, their cries shaking the fields. Not only is the autumn harvest hopeless, but even</p>
<p>the spring plowing next year will have no seeds.  On the same day, money and rice were distributed, and coffins were transported to collect corpses, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem. Yesterday, people were sent to Shanghai again to solicit donations from leaders of various charitable organizations. The above are photos taken during the on-site survey on the same day.</p>

<p>All our citizens yearn for the promulgation of the Constitution. Since Mr. Sun Zhesheng became the head of the Legislative Yuan, he has devoted all his efforts to this. Now, the draft of the Constitution has been prepared, and the ambassadors of various countries stationed in China have been entrusted to collect the current Constitutions of their respective governments. Constitutions of more than forty countries, such as Britain, Russia, Germany, Austria, the United States, and France, have been collected. Special renowned Chinese and foreign scholars have been hired to compile them into a book entitled "Compilation of Constitutions of Various Countries," for reference in the drafting of the Constitution. It is also a must-read book for the people of our country during the constitutional period. The book has been exquisitely printed and published by the Shanghai Sima Road Wangping Street Hanwen Zhengkai Printing House with movable type in regular script. The entire book has more than 700 pages, and is bound in a gold-stamped cloth cover, priced at six yuan and eight jiao. In order to assist in constitutional government, the bureau has set a special price for two months, with each book costing only four yuan. It is reported that the Legislative Yuan has issued an order to all provincial governments to purchase the book uniformly.</p>

<p>=The government authorities are considering it=</p>
<p>=Rumors that it will be abandoned are not true=</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: Yesterday, a newspaper reported an interview with He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, saying that although the Ministry of Industry had previously decided to establish a special bureau for trade with Russia to develop Sino-Russian trade, the establishment of the special bureau may be abandoned due to various reasons, and other remedial measures will be sought. The plan is being drafted. Because this matter is very important, a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. He to inquire about everything in detail. According to him, the establishment of the special bureau for trade with Russia and whether it will be established must be determined by the government's overall plan. The bureau has previously submitted various opinions for the government's reference. No definite decision has yet been received. In short, in order to develop Sino-Russian trade, our country will establish a special bureau for trade with Russia, or use other methods to seek relief. The government authorities are currently considering it. I have not heard anything yet. Yesterday's reports of my remarks that the establishment of a special bureau for trade with Russia may be abandoned due to various difficulties are definitely not true. (Xin Xin News Agency)</p>

<p>Jifubridge in Baoshan County is located at the intersection of the second, third, fourth, and fifth districts of the county. Transportation has always been inconvenient and the people's knowledge is rudimentary. Since the Farmers' Education Center initiated the organization of rural improvement districts, some construction has been done for local undertakings and unnecessary consumption has also gradually decreased. For example, there has not been a single lawsuit in July and August. However, according to rural customs, there are often flower drum performances and other events during the autumn harvest, which are of great importance to local customs. Now, in order to eliminate bad habits and promote proper entertainment, village leaders Zong Baozhu, Shi Shangzhen, Zong Baozhong, etc., have been holding a farmers' amateur recreational association at the North Zong residence for two days starting yesterday. The programs include national martial arts, silk and bamboo music, speeches, and improved Shanghai opera, etc. They also invited Ji Zhonghe, director of the Farmers' Education Center, to give a speech, the main points of which were: (1) Improving entertainment and having fun in a timely manner are indispensable to life, but happiness comes from suffering, and we should think of suffering when we are happy, and not forget suffering; (2) Increasing knowledge and skills, the survey shows that only 30% of the people in this area are literate, so more people should attend public schools; (3) Strengthening physical fitness, we should practice national martial arts, which can not only strengthen the body, but at least defend ourselves; (4) Reducing consumption, we should quit bad habits such as smoking opium and gambling; (5) Increasing production, we should pay attention to improving agricultural planting, and give more instructions on improving cotton planting methods. The listeners were moved. It is said that there were more than 6,000 people present, which is a good opportunity for education.</p>

<p>Important raw material in industry</p>
<p>Performance better than imported products</p>
<p>Shanghai business giants Kui Yanfang, Yu Zuoting, Jin Tingsun, Shi Zhikun, Xue Runsheng, etc., felt that domestic industry was becoming increasingly developed, but the raw materials were still dependent on imports, and the annual leakage was huge. They initiated the establishment of the China Calcium Carbide Factory. Calcium carbide occupies an important position in industry, such as welding steel, iron, copper, and machinery parts, manufacturing acetic acid, rayon, air fertilizer, airplane paint, military explosives, and smokeless gunpowder. All are necessary raw materials. Therefore, various countries also regard it as a necessary commodity for national defense. Recently, the factory's engineer and electrochemist, Mr. Shi Yunchang, equipped electrical equipment and carefully tested it, achieving remarkable results. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a public test was held on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association. Guests from all walks of life arrived one after another. Mr. Shi arranged equipment to trial-produce a small amount of calcium carbide, and it was completely successful after more than an hour. The domestically produced calcium carbide and the imported calcium carbide on the market were tested with the same amount. For the calcium carbide gas, each gram of imported calcium carbide can produce 290 cc of gas, while the domestically produced calcium carbide can produce 450 cc of gas. The quality is more beautiful compared to imported products. All visitors admired it. The establishment of the factory in the future will also be a boon for the future of national industry and national defense.</p>

<p>Ji Mingquan, from Xuzhou, lives in Ronghua Lane on Robison Road in West Shanghai, and his daughter Ji Dadu, who is only 15 years old, is taken care of by Ji Sheng, a Chinese constable at No. 1657, Public Concession. Ji returned to his hometown in early summer due to business. Unexpectedly, at about 7:00 PM on June 27, the girl was taken away by her uncle, Yang Xuezhong, and entrusted to friends Feng Zhaoming, Lin Chunfa, Wu Yaoting, and Gao Fengshi, etc., to marry Zhou Jingquan, an apprentice of Du Wanshun, as his wife. Du Wanshun paid 130 yuan in betrothal money. Subsequently, on August 7, Yang, the Chinese constable at No. 1657, discovered that the girl had been taken away by her uncle, Yang Xuezhong, and that her father, Ji Mingquan, had not given him custody rights. Believing that there was an act of enticement, he reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station and arrested all the criminals. He filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special District Local Court in accordance with Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, which prohibits crimes against marriage and family, and Article 240, Paragraph 2, which prohibits crimes against morality. Judge Liu presided over the interrogation and deemed it necessary to summon the girl's father, Ji Mingquan, to court to testify. After several postponements, on the morning of the 9th of this month, Judge Wu Ting took the seat in the Eighth Tribunal to conduct a new trial. The defendants Du Wanshun and Zhou Jingquan elected lawyers Long Wenhuan, etc., as joint defenders and summoned witnesses for interrogation and postponement. Yesterday (the 11th), the trial continued. Lawyers Long Wenhuan, the defense lawyers for Du and Zhou, gave a torrential eloquent argument, believing that except for the defendant Yang Xuezhong, the other defendants were unaware of the situation and could not establish a criminal act, requesting that they be declared innocent. All the defendants denied that they had committed seduction. Judge Wu reviewed the confessions and announced that the court would postpone the trial and appoint a defense attorney for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>The judge announced the verdict in court. The defendant Yang Xuezhong was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for the crime of enticing a woman under the age of 20 to leave the person with parental rights. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be offset by two days for one day of imprisonment. All other defendants were found not guilty. After hearing the verdict, Lawyer Gong immediately asked the court to release the defendants who were found not guilty in court, and the court approved.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Robberies Occur on Luban Road for Several Days <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Luban Road Quzhenren Road in Nanshi is desolate and there are few pedestrians. However, in recent years, factories have sprung up in the area and the market has gradually prospered. Due to insufficient police force, robberies occur from time to time. Therefore, residents in the area are all wary. Unexpectedly, robberies have occurred twice in recent days. At 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man in a white silk long gown hired a rickshaw from Lujiawan to somewhere. When he reached the front of the Pinchao Huishan Villa on Quzhenren Road, three bandits dressed in blue cloth short shirts and pants resembling workers suddenly jumped out, each holding a sharp blade, and stopped him to rob him. In addition to being robbed of his clothes and money, the two rubber tires of the rickshaw wheel and the rickshaw puller's fare were also taken away, which is really pitiful. It is hoped that those responsible for local security will pay attention to this, then the locality will be fortunate.</p>

<p>=Bearing Shame and Humiliation, She Returns Home Pregnant=</p>
<p>=Suing Her Husband for Abandonment and Abuse=</p>
<p>丨Lawyer Yu Yuanbin's Defense Also Has Its Reasons丨</p>
<p>Yu Yuanbin, a Cantonese residing upstairs in the Erxiazhai Pharmacy on Henan Road, is a shareholder in the store. In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he met Lin Xiuzhen, the daughter of a widowed woman, Lin Deng, from the same village residing at No. 81 Tongchang Lane, Haining Road. At that time, Xiuzhen was only 29 years old and still unmarried. Yu found her extremely beautiful, and</p>
<p>was very affectionate towards her, so he showed her great courtesy. Xiuzhen also responded with intimacy, and they often traveled together, like a couple. When Lin Deng discovered this, Yu</p>
<h3 id="e164">Took the Opportunity to Propose <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>But Lin Deng strictly rejected it. However, Xiuzhen had been bewitched and did not repent despite her mother's reprimands. Instead, she listened to Yu's enticements and eloped with him to Guangdong behind her mother's back. After arriving in Guangzhou, Yu hired a lawyer to fill out a marriage certificate, and fabricated a matchmaker and witnesses. They</p>
<p>married in Guangdong and lived there for more than a month before returning to Shanghai together to serve Yu's mother.</p>
<p>Before long, Yu's love for her gradually faded, and they often argued. Yu's mother sided with her son and abused her daughter-in-law. Later, when their maid grew up and was sent to marry,</p>
<h3 id="e165">All the Labor of the Servants <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>was ordered to be done by Xiuzhen. If she disobeyed slightly, she would be beaten and humiliated. Xiuzhen could only endure it. Last spring, when the Shanghai war broke out, Yu's family went to Guangdong to seek refuge. The boat seats they purchased were also of different classes, so Xiuzhen lived alone in a fourth-class cabin. When they arrived in Hong Kong, they were forbidden to disembark due to epidemic prevention, and the food on the ship was scarce. The passengers in the fourth-class cabin were all in dire straits. Yu did not even share a morsel. After returning to Shanghai, the abuse became even worse, because Yu was also fond of another woman and regarded Xiuzhen as a thorn in his side. On the night of July 17, Yu</p>
<h3 id="e166">Suddenly Felt Amorous <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>and wanted Xiuzhen to accompany him. However, Xiuzhen said that she</p>
<p>was two months pregnant and should abstain from sex, and politely refused. Unexpectedly, Yu suddenly became angry and accused Xiuzhen of having an affair and expelled her. Yu's mother also echoed him. Xiuzhen knew it was difficult to stay any longer, and when she thought of her elopement in the past, she really had no face to go home to see her mother at this time. However, she had no other relatives, and she was at a loss on all sides and had nowhere to settle down. As a result of thinking, she had to shamelessly return home and beg her mother not to blame her for the past. Lin Deng, since her beloved daughter disappeared, in addition to reporting to the police station for investigation, also searched everywhere for her. There had been no news for a long time. Although she suspected that Yu Yuanbin was not without a relationship, but with no evidence, it was not convenient to interfere. This time,</p>
<h3 id="e167">Seeing Her Daughter Return <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>and hearing about her experience, she was filled with mixed feelings of joy and anger. After all, the relationship between mother and daughter was innate, and she could not bear to blame her severely. She kept her at home and discussed the procedures for dealing with Yu Yuanbin. She decided that Lin Xiuzhen would first submit a petition to the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Local Court, detailing the circumstances of her abuse and abandonment by Yu, requesting that Yu be summoned to court, persuaded to divorce, and ordered to pay maintenance of 60 yuan per month, calculated from the current age of 25 to the age of 60, totaling 26,920 yuan,</p>
<p>and the soon</p>
<h3 id="e168">About to Give Birth <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Production costs of 600 yuan, etc. In addition, the woman's mother, Lin Deng, filed a separate criminal lawsuit against Yu, accusing him of seducing a woman under the age of 20 and requesting that he be punished with the crime he deserves in accordance with Article 257 of the Criminal Law. Yu also hired lawyer Yang Guoshu to state his defense in the criminal part of the lawsuit, saying that in the autumn of the 17th year, Yu lived in the He Xinglong Foreign Goods Store opened by Yu's parents in Qingyun Lane, North Sichuan Road, while the Lin Deng mother and daughter lived in the same alley. At that time, Lin Xiuzhen was a telephone operator at the China Foreign Telephone</p>
<p>Company and often went to He Xinglong with her younger brother Lin Ganting to borrow the telephone, thereby getting to know Yu. Then, from friendship, they</p>
<h3 id="e169">Developed Love <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>and talked about marriage. However, Yu's mother objected because Xiuzhen was a telephone operator. Yu did not dare to make his own decision because his mother did not agree. However, Xiuzhen declared that if Yu did not marry her as his wife, she would commit suicide. Yu saw her so determined and comforted her gently. In November of that year, Xiuzhen said to Yu that she had inquired from a lawyer that both of them were adults and could make their own marriage decisions without the consent of their parents, and forced Yu to marry her. Yu was afraid that the wedding in Shanghai would be prevented by his parents, and Xiuzhen suggested</p>
<h3 id="e170">Going to Guangdong to Get Married <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Even if his parents found out in the future, it would be a fait accompli. Yu agreed. At that time, all the plans were discussed at the woman's house, and the plaintiff and her children all knew about it. After arriving in Guangdong, Yu told his uncle about it and visited a lawyer.</p>
<p>Since both men and women are adults, they can get married on their own. The lawyer then published a statement in the newspaper. After returning to Shanghai after the marriage, the woman wrote a letter to inform the plaintiff. The following year, on New Year's Day, she and the woman went to the plaintiff's house to greet the New Year. From then on, the woman often returned to her parents' home, and the woman's siblings also often went to Yu's house and interacted with each other, like relatives. In July of this year, because Xiuzhen often</p>
<h3 id="e171">Danced with Men <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yu euphemistically dissuaded her because she was pregnant, but she became angry, secretly took her jewelry, and quietly returned to her mother's home, never to return, and filed a lawsuit for no reason, intentionally making unreasonable demands, and demanding a huge amount of alimony from him to settle the matter, which was extremely cunning. If seduction is discussed, Xiuzhen should be responsible for the crime, which has nothing to do with Yu, because he was forced by Xiuzhen at the time, and threatened to commit suicide. Please dismiss the original lawsuit, so that the broken mirror can be reunited. Yesterday, Chief Judge Feng Shide of the First Special Court summoned both parties for interrogation. The statements of both parties were as stated in their respective documents.</p>
<p>After the two lawyers argued successively, the official ordered that the verdict be announced on the 18th of this month.</p>

<p>Another First Prize Discovered</p>
<p>=Zhu Qichang Also Has Prize Coupon No. 226622=</p>
<p>=Accusing Hua Dong Tobacco Company Manager Li of Fraud=</p>
<p>The China Hua Dong Tobacco Company, in order to promote Betel Nut Brand cigarettes, issued a prize coupon for sales promotion, divided into two series, totaling</p>
<p>one million numbers. There were two first prizes, each worth five thousand yuan. The prize drawing dates and numbers were based on the standards of the Aviation Prize Coupons. On July 31st, the winning number for the first prize of the aviation lottery was 226622. The winner was Zhu Wenjiang, a Chinese constable with badge number 3173 from the General Patrol Room, who claimed his prize money from the company on August 5th. Later, Li Dongtao claimed that he also had a prize coupon with the same number, but the Hua Dong Company refused to pay. He sued in the First Special Court, and as a result, the manager of the Hua Dong Tobacco Company,</p>
<p>Li Xuedong, was declared innocent. All these details were reported in this newspaper. Recently,</p>
<p>Zhu Qichang from Anhui Province stated that he also held a Betel Nut Brand prize coupon with the number 226622. He had requested payment from the Hua Dong Tobacco Company but was unsuccessful. Therefore, he hired lawyer Tang Youwei to file a fraud lawsuit in the First Special Court against Li Xuedong, the manager of Hua Dong, and Li Runsheng, the assistant manager. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. Both defendants, accompanied by their legal representative, lawyer Chen Zhongyin, appeared in court to handle the case. Zhu Qichang was absent and was represented by lawyer Tang, who outlined the key points of the prosecution, stating that in July, Zhu exchanged five Betel Nut Brand hard-pack cigarette boxes for a prize coupon from the Hua Dong Tobacco Company. When the prize was drawn on July 31st, Zhu's number matched the first prize, and he was overjoyed. On August 1st, he inquired about the procedure for claiming the prize at the company but was told that the prize money had already been claimed and that he was too late. Zhu found this matter quite strange and entrusted his lawyer to negotiate on his behalf, but to no avail. Hence the lawsuit. However, according to newspaper reports, the prize money was claimed on August 5th, while Zhu Qichang inquired at the company on August 1st. At that time, the company staff claimed that the prize money had already been claimed, which raises suspicions. Furthermore, why are there so many first prize winners? This should be investigated. A civil suit is also attached, seeking compensation of five thousand yuan. Li Runsheng testified that he was only in charge of the company's financial transactions and had no knowledge of the prize coupon matters. Li Xuedong stated that the prize coupons were printed by Da Xing Printing Factory, and Xie Long Tobacco Company was the general manager. Due to a temporary oversight by the printing factory, some coupons were mistakenly printed with duplicate numbers, resulting in blank coupons being issued rashly. However, the details of this matter can be proven by someone from the printing factory, and the previous case had already testified in court. Judge Huang reviewed the testimony and adjourned the case for further hearing. Both defendants withdrew.</p>

<p>=Passionate Love Precedes Bitter Breakup=</p>
<p>=Her Mother Now Files a Lawsuit=</p>
<p>Zhang Wangshi, a 45-year-old woman from Zhujing Town, Jinshan County, Songjiang, has a daughter named Zhang Aina, who is 18 years old. With a charming appearance, she entered the Lafayette dance hall as a dancer due to her family's poverty, living a life of embraces and using her earnings to support her elderly mother, relying on each other to survive. A certain university student named Xu Jiaqing, 22 years old from Guangdong, residing at No. 39 Ruihua Lane, Lafayette Road, in a two-story building, is the son of an official family and has a considerable amount of wealth. Jiaqing is a dissolute young</p>
<p>man, a handsome youth who likes to indulge in entertainment. He often visits the Lafayette dance hall with two or three friends. He was immediately captivated by Aina's beautiful face, considering her a celestial being. He pursued her relentlessly, seducing her with sweet words. On April 28th of this year, she was lured to the Grand Shanghai Hotel. Xu falsely claimed to the girl that he was not yet married, discussed marriage with her, and even wrote a statement promising that he would never be unfaithful, otherwise he would be willing to compensate for all losses. At the time, Aina was young and inexperienced, believing Jiaqing's solemn oath to be true. She fell into his trap and allowed him to rape her. From then on, her purity was stained, and she could never wash away the shame. Aina still thought that since there was a marriage agreement, they would be husband and wife in the future, so she allowed him to continue to sexually assault her. Later, Aina learned that Xu Jiaqing was already married. When she confronted him, Xu not only showed no sign of comfort but even spoke rudely and stopped visiting her altogether. Aina, helpless, told her mother, Zhang Wangshi, about the situation. Zhang Wangshi, as her legal guardian, hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation in the Second Special District Court, accusing Xu of abduction and also filing a civil lawsuit to recover losses. The court accepted the case and summoned both parties the other day, scheduling a hearing for this afternoon.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Lei Dafu, who was assassinated near the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Yingxun Road in Xiaoximen the day before yesterday, has been found by a certain party not to be a secret investigator for the Public Security Bureau. According to their statement, Mr. Lei did not have any occupation before his death, but he was very familiar with the Public Security Bureau and the inspectors of the concession. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau also knew of his existence, but he was definitely not employed. His sudden assassination was definitely not due to official revenge.

<p>that have been reorganized and established in accordance with the current laws and regulations. It has now been more than three years, and the terms of office of the staff have long expired. Many of them have been re-elected in accordance with the law, but there are also many that have not been re-elected. We hereby order that your association comply and promptly inform the relevant industry associations that have not been re-elected to convene a meeting of member representatives on a regular basis and hold re-elections in accordance with the law, which is important, and so on. Upon receiving this, we inquired about the staff of the industry associations. According to the articles of association, their</p>
<p>terms of office are set at four years, and half of them should be re-elected every two years and cannot be re-elected. The first re-election is determined by drawing lots, but when the number of committee members is odd, the number of those retained may be one more than those re-elected. All have clear regulations.

They resided in Jue Lu on Da Xi Road, studying Chinese Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhist Association, Shanghai Buddhist Association, Buddhist Pure Land Society, and other three organizations, recognized that Viro's visit to China was a sign of friendly religious practitioners coming to China to study Buddhism, a forewarning of Eastern culture spreading to Europe. Therefore, they held a welcome meeting at Jue Garden on Hede Road yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM and invited Chinese and foreign people to attend, which was very grand for a time. The details obtained are recorded below.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yellow River Flood Relief Entertainment Fair is being held at the Great World. It is only open today and will not be extended. In order to encourage people from all walks of life to help the disaster victims and arouse the interest of tourists, in addition to the original</p>
<p>wonderful dramas and the performances by all the martial arts experts in the National Martial Arts Hall, Luo from Wenzhou (nicknamed "Midget") was specially invited to set up a ring and use the plum blossom pile martial arts for sparring. His skills are amazing. It is said that all the actors are volunteering. Visitors can enjoy themselves and also save the starving and drowning victims, which is a win-win situation.</p>

<p>In addition to Zhao Kong and the thirteen Buddhists from France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium, Viro, etc., the attendees were Zhu Qinglan, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Liande, Jian Yujie, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhao Yunshao, Li Jingwei, Huang Yichang, Liang Muwen, Zhang Yuanpei, Lu Si'an, De Hao, Mingdao, Hongsan, and foreign guests such as Dr. Fuchs from Germany, Mrs.乔洛, Ms.沙罗门, Mrs.罗路姆非而违, Mrs.克东,韦旱脱, Mrs.发立士,克罗耳, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling several hundred people.</p>

<p>Mingdao Shi and Guan Jiongzhi were publicly elected as chairpersons, and Zhao Puzhu and Wang Junhe were the recorders. The ceremony was held according to the regulations, and everyone stood in silence. After the chanting of the name of Sakyamuni Buddha and the Mi Fo verse, Mingdao Shi first delivered the welcome address, which was translated into English by Guan Jiongzhi and recorded by a reporter from Heping News Agency.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The welcome address is as follows: Today, the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, and the Buddhist Pure Land Society have prepared simple refreshments and invited everyone to come together, and we are deeply honored. It is extremely rare for Europeans to come to China to study, especially to study Buddhism and be willing to be ordained as monks. You can be considered the first group to understand and accept Chinese culture. This is the most gratifying thing in the world. The fundamental essence of Buddhism is to teach people to eliminate delusions. Those who study Buddhism must control and guard their six senses: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, preventing them from seeking outwards. They must let go of all the worldly burdens in order to gain the true benefits of Buddhism, because Buddhism is definitely not obtained from the outside. You have come from Europe to this place, abandoning all material enjoyments and worldly affections, not hesitating to travel tens of thousands of miles with hardship, and not hesitating to overcome various difficulties in living, eating, and speaking, dedicating yourselves to studying inner civilization and the true path. This shows that you are truly able to eliminate delusions and let go of external ties. This is the true practice of Buddhism and deserves our joy and praise. We hope that each of you will take on the task of Sakyamuni Buddha and become meritorious officials in spreading Buddhism to all sentient beings. We wish you all success.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Zhao Kong's Speech <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Next, Zhao Kong gave a speech entitled "The Path of the Buddha," which was translated into Chinese by a reporter from Heping News Agency. It briefly stated that the Buddha is omniscient and omnipotent. If people can practice according to the Buddhist Dharma, they can also reach the position of omniscience and omnipotence. The purpose of Buddhism is not to make people become scholars, nor is it to instill many books and their formulas and laws into people's minds through such pseudo-education. In fact, true knowledge cannot be found in books. The purpose of the Buddha is to seek the fundamental knowledge and methods for people to escape from this world of suffering, so that they can enter the true gate of Nirvana. The methods are briefly described as follows: (1) Strictly observe the precepts, that is, do not kill, do not steal, do not commit adultery, do not lie, do not drink alcohol, and other precepts. (2) Guard the six senses, that is, the eyes do not pursue color, the ears do not pursue sound, the nose does not pursue fragrance, the tongue does not pursue taste, the body does not pursue touch, and the mind does not pursue the Dharma. (3) Be mindful of walking when walking, staying when staying, sitting when sitting, and lying down when lying down. (4) According to the removal of the five aggregates, remove greed, remove hatred, remove sleepiness, remove distraction,</p>
<p>remove doubt. (5) Practice the four foundations of mindfulness, observing the body as impure, observing sensation as suffering, observing the mind as impermanent, and observing non-self. (6) Practice the four right efforts, eliminate the evil that has already arisen, prevent the evil that has not yet arisen, generate the good that has not yet arisen, and increase the good that has already arisen. At this point, the Dharma master recounted the wonders of the four dhyanas and eight samadhis and the six supernatural powers, quoting the scriptures and being extremely profound. Those who heard it were all delighted and praised him.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Public Acknowledgment and Gratitude <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>After Zhao Kong's speech, Stan Kai, a German disciple representing Master Zhao Kong, gave a thank-you speech. After following Master Zhao Kong to Huashan, we were warmly welcomed by everyone and are extremely grateful. The Chinese people have been studying Buddhism since before the Age of Teachings and know the path to true knowledge. Seeing their gentle, compassionate, and peaceful virtues, we know that they have been deeply influenced by Buddhism. This is our first time coming to China, and we have seen this kind of atmosphere everywhere in China. We are very fortunate to be able to study Buddhism together with the Chinese people. Next, Xue Fu, representing the French disciples, gave a speech. When we arrived in China on July 25th, everyone came to the pier to welcome us and sent us to Jue Lu. I immediately felt everyone's kindness. We followed our teacher to China because we wanted to leave the world and become monks and nuns in the Buddhist country. You are our fellow brothers and sisters, and we hope that you will work with us to create blessings for China and the world. Then, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Lawyer Xu Zuoliang, who also operates a property management business, had a tenant named Ling Shenqing renting a house in Caojiadu. Due to unpaid rent, Xu filed a lawsuit in the local court, which ruled that Ling should repay the rent and vacate the premises. The case was settled. The court executed the eviction, but Ling repeatedly delayed. The other day, when Xu went to urge him again, Ling, together with his wife, used buckets of feces to splash him all over. Xu considered Ling's prank to be a deliberate insult, so he reported the incident to the Sixth District Police, who arrested Ling. He was sent to the local court for detention and investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Woman Convicted for Passing Counterfeit Coins <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years in Prison</p>
<p>Tao Wu, a woman from Nanyang, recently colluded with a fellow villager, Mr. Jia, in the Yangshupu Yinxianggang Dongzhakou area, specializing in using counterfeit Yuan head silver dollars to deceive small vendors for profit. At around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, Wang Penghao from Taizhou set up a bamboo utensil stall in the area. The woman asked Jia to buy a bundle of chopsticks, priced at fifteen copper yuan.</p>
<p>She also bought two catties of taro from Ma Jinchun and others from Pudong, priced at twenty-four copper yuan. They first each gave a genuine silver dollar, and the two small vendors took them to a nearby cigarette and paper shop to have them checked before putting them in their pockets to get change. The woman then tried to switch the coins, saying that the silver dollars all had hard prints and could not be mistaken, deliberately taking them back to</p>
<p>inspect them, taking advantage of the opportunity to replace them with counterfeit coins. Her technique was nimble, and the two vendors were unaware that they had suddenly become counterfeit money. However, Zhu Guixian and Zhu Xiansheng, who were nearby, saw it and told the horse vendor to pay attention to the silver dollar. Ma checked his pocket again and found that it was indeed different from the previous silver dollar. He ran to the cigarette and paper shop to have it checked and confirmed that it was a counterfeit coin. He immediately grabbed the woman and argued with her. At this time, Jia had already fled without a trace. Hua Tan Liu Changgen arrived, inquired about the situation, and arrested the woman. Small vendor Wang Penghao also checked the coin he had received for the chopsticks and found that it was also made of copper. He informed Detective Liu, and they took the woman to the Yangshupu Police Station. The police chief ordered female patrol officer Gu Zhang to search the woman, and they found three more counterfeit coins of the same type in her left sock. She was sent to a women's detention center. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin detailed the situation, stating that the defendant had claimed at the police station that the copper coins had been obtained from selling half a dan of rice in Shanghai, which was completely false. It was found that she had committed the same crime eleven years ago and had been dealt with for a month. He presented the counterfeit coins and requested that she be punished. Small vendors Ma Jinchun and Wang Penghao, and witnesses Zhu Guixian and Zhu Xiansheng, gave their statements. When questioned, the defendant stammered and begged for forgiveness. Judge Wu Zihan sentenced Tao Wu to three years in prison, and the counterfeit coins were confiscated and destroyed.</p>

<p>Recently, the bicycles used by messengers from various agencies and foreign firms in this city have</p>
<p>often been stolen. Although reports have been made to the police and public security agencies to investigate, there have been few breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The other day, Hua Tan Liang Junshan, No. 330, and Japanese Tan Yokoyama Masao, No. 181, of the Hongkou Police Station of the Public Concession, arrested a bicycle thief named Wang Ziyun. According to him, he lived at No. 72 Minli Road, Zhabei, and worked as a messenger at a poverty loan office. He had not stolen any bicycles. All the stolen bicycles were stolen by his friend Jin Genfa. He only helped Jin to sell the stolen bicycles at Hongxing Bicycle Shop, No. 1340 Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, a total of six vehicles, plus five bookshelves and two chain cases. Another two vehicles were sold at Lu Yunfei Bicycle Shop, No. 802 Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, for more than twenty yuan each. In total, he had made about eighty or ninety yuan. The police have arrested the bicycle thief Jin Genfa, and his confession is the same. Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, Detective Liang, along with the Japanese detective, armed with documents and accompanied by the informant Wang Ziyun, went to the Second Precinct Second Branch and requested police assistance in recovering the stolen goods. Director Tang immediately dispatched police chief Gao Yutian to accompany them</p>
<p>to the bicycle shops where the stolen goods were sold, and recovered eight original stolen bicycles.

<p>Shen Wanru, the daughter of Shen Ruilin (formerly Shen Yanyi), the former Austrian Minister and Foreign Minister and the current Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, married Li Dingshi, a native of the same town (Wuxing, Zhejiang), many years ago and has three sons and one daughter. The couple's relationship was always close. Now, Ms. Shen claims that her husband is having an affair, abandoning her, treating her coldly, and renting a house with the other woman. In this situation, it is difficult to grow old together, so she hired lawyer Zhang Ding to apply for divorce at the Mediation Office of the Local Court and requested a one-time payment of 105,000 yuan in alimony. The other party, Li Dingshi, also hired lawyers Jin Yu and Ling Qihong to defend him. The court has held a hearing before, but both parties did not appear. The judge ordered an out-of-court settlement. It is now known that the case was heard again yesterday by Judge Wang Shicheng. Both parties were still absent, and only lawyers Jin and Ling, hired by Li Dingshi, appeared on behalf of the other party. They stated the age and origin of the other party, briefly saying that Li Dingshi is 31 years old and was previously the General Manager of Huimin Milk Powder Company at No. 414 Jiangxi Road. Since this case occurred, Li has resigned from the position of General Manager and is now only a shareholder of the company. However, both parties are from Wuxing, Zhejiang,</p>
<p>and regarding the jurisdiction issue, the plaintiff should file a lawsuit in the Wuxing court. As a result, the judge ordered a further investigation to be conducted.</p>

<p>Where Does the Red Light Come From?</p>
<p>Is Someone Spreading Rumors?</p>
<p>The Zhang Guowei Hospital and the house where the carpenter monk lives on Caishi Street (behind the Great World) in the French Concession are neighbors. At 2:30 AM yesterday (the twelfth), the roof of the building was glowing red. The neighbors thought it was a fire. In a short time, fire trucks arrived at the area around the area. Firefighters searched the street near where the fire was suspected to be but the houses had no fire. There were five or six fire trucks that arrived. After the fire trucks checked and found that there were no fires, they drove back. After the incident, the police learned of it and sent detectives to check the three-story building of the carpenter monk's house. There were no signs of fire. They then checked the three-story building of Dr. Zhang Guowei's place, and there was no fire either. The detectives returned to the police station to report. According to the neighbors, there were many people who saw the fire on the roof. However, there is a fox spirit hall on the third floor of the building. Some say that the fox spirit is causing trouble, but this is not known. Those who witnessed the red light on the roof were amazed and could not stop talking about it.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: Regarding the news reported in today's major newspapers that Lei Dafu (also known as Jiang Shen), a secret investigator from the Supervision Department of our bureau, was assassinated by the Communist Party on Jiangyin Street in Nanshi on the 11th of this month, please note that the Supervision Department of our bureau has never employed secret investigators or informants, and there is no one named Lei Dafu (also known as Jiang Shen) among our staff. The various details reported are indeed rumors and inaccurate. In addition to ordering a thorough investigation of the truth and stepping up the search for the murderer to reassure the public, we are also sending separate letters to request correction.

<p>To the Editor of Shenbao: Regarding the news in the local news column of your newspaper yesterday about the labor dispute at Hengmao Tailors, please note that it is inconsistent with the facts. Our company rented 22 barges from the American company Taimei Yanghang and signed a contract stating that Taimei would deliver the empty ships to Hengmao. Therefore, the responsibility for dismissing the workers on the ships rests with Taimei and has nothing to do with our company. Furthermore, our company took over the empty ships on September 7th and did not dismiss 98 workers. Now, these workers are confusing matters and misleading the public, which is inconsistent with the facts. We are writing to request that your chairman publish a correction.

<h3 id="e203">Thieves <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>"Thief" and "robber" are naturally not "law-abiding citizens," but there are still some differences in status. In China, it seems that the status of a thief is much higher. Being a thief seems to be worthy of praise. For example, Mr. Tang Jieyuan Bo of our Suzhou, who specialized in "stealing jade and seducing foreign women" throughout his life, still has so many admirers who pluck the icy strings and "smile" and "smile again" on the radio broadcasting station. The literati salivate over other people's antiques and calligraphy, but have no way to obtain them, so "of the thirty-six strategies, stealing is the best." Even if "both the thief and the stolen goods are caught," it is still a "strong thief's demeanor." Sun Wukong stealing peaches and ginseng fruits is even more eternally famous and immortal.</p>
<p>It can be seen that "stealing" is not "despicable," so the great Mr. Pu, who carried out "stealing the country," may still receive the "duke" title in the future?</p>
<p>But the foreign devils are ultimately useless, unable to catch up with our Chinese "civilized lineage," engaging in secretive activities and specializing in robbery and murder. What they consider the most heroic is "piracy." Whether in novels or movies, the more mercilessly pirates kill, the more they are admired. The "bandits" on land are also admired by all. Therefore, the "Lincheng train robbery" can make people from all countries</p>
<p>jump in fright, and the pirates in Dapeng Bay make foreign devils "vigilant" and dare not underestimate the Chinese, who are a bunch of pus-filled cowards, but also have many "heroes." Therefore, the 108 heroes of Liangshan Marsh, who have always been regarded as "jumping clowns," if someone is full and has nothing to do, might as well translate them into foreign languages and spread them to various countries. Not only can they make a lot of profit, but they can also make the foreign devils who "value robbery over theft" dare not look down on us Chinese again.</p>
<p>However, whether you are a "thief" in front of Chinese people or a "robber" in front of foreigners, you must "know your place." As a thief, you must be "romantic and elegant," or "bold and reckless." As a robber, you must go so far as to "rob merchant ships" or "occupy mountain strongholds." If you steal short shirts and pants or rob silk threads on the road, once you are caught by the officials, although you may get to release your sexual desire once after a certain period, "lying high in an iron window" is ultimately not what you want.</p>

<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>Several hundred years ago, an Italian priest named Matteo Ricci came to China to preach. When he returned, in order to make the people of his country understand the situation in China, he specially wrote a book called "Oriental Inquiries," which described everything about China. In particular, one point was very noticeable, saying: "China is full of gold and jewels." This led people from Europe and the West to come to China in droves to see what it was really like. This was, of course, a disappointing thing.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, recently, this sentence has actually come true. You can make money everywhere. Airline tickets and champagne tickets are opportunities to make a fortune. The empty cigarette packs left over from smoking can be exchanged for lottery tickets and ingots, and used for foreign money. The wrapping paper and empty boxes left over from using soap can also be exchanged for lottery tickets and foreign money...</p>
<p>From this, we can see that people who are keen on making money, who originally smoked a pack of cigarettes every day, now smoke more and more in order to have more opportunities to make money, gradually increasing to two packs, three packs... Friends who use soap are also quickly using, buying, and exchanging tickets to quickly win prizes, so the shareholders in the company are all smiling with delight and can't close their mouths.</p>
<p>Originally, money is what everyone likes. In China, it is indeed full of gold, and you can make money everywhere. A poor scholar can become rich without lifting a finger.</p>
<p>Mr. Matteo Ricci, thank you for your prediction, which has become a reality. However, is this a good phenomenon? Of course, there is a great deal of reason for this, and I don't need to say more, so I will stop writing here.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Kissing <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>When the heat of love between two sexes reaches its peak, they follow it with a kiss in order to seek sexual comfort. On the stage of love, kissing is an unavoidable scene in a play, but from the perspective of hygienists, although kissing between two sexes can provide comfort in love, if one party has an infectious disease, such as syphilis, leprosy, tuberculosis, etc., even though they can enjoy the</p>
<p>right to love between lip and lip contact, they must also taste the obligation of contracting germs. Therefore, although the term "kissing" is so fragrant and flavorful, if you look at it from the other side, there are both advantages and disadvantages!</p>
<p>Kissing between people is direct, and kissing between people and things is</p>
<p>indirect. We know that flies in summer are extremely dirty. Their bodies squat on food, and their saliva remains in the dishes. If we are not careful and eat this kind of food,</p>
<p>there is indeed no difference from kissing flies. The transmission of disease and the loss of life, the price of this kiss, is truly alarming! Eradicating flies in summer is seen by mankind as the most urgent and important task that cannot be delayed. Women and children all understand this principle. Kissing between people and flies is truly a terrible thing!</p>
<p>In addition, there is a matter in society that people do not pay attention to, which is the old newspapers that have been read by people and are regarded as waste. Because people study the utilization of waste, they use them to wrap copper coins and paste walls. However, there is a boss who opens a food store who is really nervous and takes them to wrap food. The writing on the newspapers and the ink used are known to anyone with knowledge to contain toxic</p>
<p>substances, and can only be looked at but not eaten. Now, because of wrapping food, people's mouths can indirectly have intimate kisses with them. This kind of harm is no different from eating the saliva of flies!</p>
<p>From the above points of view, kissing between people is fragrant and flavorful, but it still contains dangerous facts! Kissing between people and things is neither voluntary nor invisible, and the harm obtained is really like a dumb person dreaming of his mother, unable to express the pain! Disasters come from the mouth. We must pay special attention to our daily life and diet, and not carelessly make indirect contact with dangerous things.</p>

<p>Anyone with red, blue, black, and white colors on their face is definitely a modern woman.</p>

<p>Chapter 15: The Guest Leaves With Bashful Tenderness, Waves With a Smile</p>
<p>Someone Comes to Visit, Old Enmities Start, Sadness is Awakened</p>
<p>Guizhi really had nothing to say, but seeing Zhao Ziqiang in such an awkward state, if she didn't comfort him, she was afraid that this honest man would have other doubts, so she said, "You don't need to say anything, I know all these things. Aren't my ears for listening? Aren't my eyes for seeing?" After saying this, she sighed and smiled again. Zhao Ziqiang saw that her words already carried a hint of joking, as if they were much more familiar, so he said with a smile, "Please don't be polite, eat whatever you want." Guizhi remained silent for a while, and still stood up, looking as if she wanted to leave. Zhao Ziqiang touched his head and smiled, "Is there anything urgent at home?" Guizhi hesitated for a while before smiling, "Although there's nothing urgent, I've been out for too long, and my mother will ask." As she spoke, she had already walked out. Zhao Ziqiang felt that she didn't necessarily have to leave, but he didn't know how to persuade her to stay, so he let her go. Watching Guizhi leave, he couldn't help feeling disappointed, so he couldn't help but follow her from behind. He followed her all the way to the counter, and Guizhi turned around, stopped, and waved her hands at him, saying, "Don't see me off, don't see me off!" When she said this, her brow was slightly furrowed, naturally expressing that she was not very willing. Zhao Ziqiang understood and didn't walk any further. He returned to the booth, paid for the refreshments, and happily walked home. As he passed through the courtyard, the sound of his leather shoes stepping on the floor tiles clearly showed that he was very pleased. He took off his hat with one hand and lifted the cotton curtain with the other, calling out "Dad" and bowing to Zhao Weng. Zhao Weng saw that he was smiling and asked in a low voice, "Did you get any news?" Zhao Ziqiang didn't say anything, but couldn't help but smile, and nodded, "It's probably no problem." Zhao Weng took down the tobacco pipe hanging on his belt, lit it, and slowly smoked it. (185)</p>
<h3 id="e208">Killing a Chicken <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Qiushen</p>
<p>My mother wanted to eat chicken. So today, Luo came back from the vegetable market with a yellow hen in her basket. The chicken was bought, but there was no one to kill it. Both Luo and my mother were very timid, and they would tremble when they picked up a knife. My mother had never even killed a fish. According to her, she had never stepped on an ant to death in her life, let alone killed a chicken. Therefore, this murderer was pushed onto me. "Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life, and humans have a heart of compassion." I should not make things difficult for them, so "gentlemen should stay away from the kitchen."</p>
<p>I rolled up my sleeves, held the knife in one hand, and grabbed the chicken's wings, legs, and head together with the other hand. I plucked some of the feathers from the chicken's neck, and just as I was about to put the knife to it, I caught sight of Luo holding Lin beside me. Of course, I told Luo to take Lin away, so that this little pure soul would not be imprinted with this impression of cruel behavior.</p>
<p>Watching the white knife go in and the red knife come out, the chicken's blood flowed gurglingly. After a moment, it closed its eyes tightly. Then I put down the bucket, stretched its legs a few times, and sang out some faint final struggles, and its life was over.</p>
<p>Originally, killing a chicken is a small matter, what does it count as cruel behavior? In this bustling city during the day, people killing people is a common occurrence, and we Chinese are especially like little chickens, being slaughtered by others!</p>
<p>Are we forever being slaughtered!</p>

<h3 id="e209">Methods for Making Household Soap and Toilet Soap <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Soap is an essential daily commodity, generally divided into household soap and toilet soap. Here are the detailed manufacturing methods, for the reference of those interested in practical industries.</p>
<p>The raw materials used for household soap include tallow, rosin, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, tung oil, castor oil, coconut oil, soda ash, lime, etc. First, mix various oils and dissolve them in a ground vat. Then, use a pump to pump them into an acid vat, add sulfuric acid, and after six hours, remove impurities and moisture for later use. Separately, take lime and water, dissolve them in an alkali vat, and gradually add the above-purified oil into the alkali vat, heating it with steam until it becomes milky. The next day, lime soap is formed. Transport the lime soap through a crusher and grinder, and a conveyor to a storage tank above a stainless steel leaching column. Soak it with highly heated water for twelve hours, then release it, which is called "sweet water," and it tastes very sweet! Inject it into an evaporation tank to evaporate the water, then pass it through a leaching machine to obtain crude glycerol, which can be used for other industrial products. Transfer the lime soap in the leaching column, after removing the sweet water, to a soap pot using a conveyor. Simultaneously, add soda ash and heat with steam. After twelve hours, add sodium chloride to separate the soap from the lime. The floating part is the soap, and the sinking part is the lime mud. Release the lime mud and store it in a ground pool. Use water to extract the alkali solution from the lime mud. The remaining lime mud, after drying, becomes crude calcium carbonate, which can be used for industrial products. Heat the extracted alkali solution with rosin using steam to create rosin soap. Mix the rosin soap with the soap in the soap pot, and after twelve hours, pure soap is formed. Then, use a pump to pump it into a soap machine for storage. When ready to use, inject the soap from the soap machine into a mixer, add fragrance, and use a refrigeration pump to pump it into a soap cooling machine. After half an hour, it solidifies into a large block. Then, take it out and use a soap cutting machine to cut it into</p>
<p>small pieces, and household soap is made.</p>
<p>The oils used for toilet soap are slightly different from those for household soap, mainly consisting of tallow, coconut oil, and castor oil. The manufacturing process is also the same as described above for household soap, except that a separate pot is used for boiling. After the soap is formed, it is also injected into a soap cooling machine to solidify into blocks. Then, it is cut into long strips and placed in a glass vacuum room for bleaching. After several months, when it becomes pure white, move it to a spiraling drying room. The upper part of the room has a planing machine. Take the pure white long strips of soap, put them into the planing machine, and plane them into flakes. Use the spiral device to spread them on several layers of copper wire for drying in the room. After about one or two hours, transfer a certain amount of the soap to a soap mixer, add fragrance and pigment, and start the mixer. After about an hour, transfer it to a grinding machine. Repeat this process several times until the fragrance and pigment are thoroughly mixed. Then, transfer it to a spiral extrusion machine. The</p>
<p>inside is like a spiral shaft. The soap is extruded by the spiral, and the product can be changed into various models, so round, square, etc., can be made.</p>
<p>The long strips extruded from the extrusion machine are cut into small pieces using a separator, and then moved to a printing press for printing. Place them in shallow wooden grids and move them to another vacuum drying room. After drying for about a week, toilet</p>
<p>soap is made.</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: The above describes the indirect soap-making method of Mr. Lever Brothers. The Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, run by Chinese businessmen, uses this method for manufacturing, and its products are of excellent quality! There is no need to elaborate. However, in recent years, foreign goods and inferior soaps have been rampantly manufactured and sold at reduced prices, attempting to dump their products, which is a hidden danger for the future of domestic goods!</p>

<p>The Extension Education Office of the Provincial Hangzhou Normal School, in order to provide elementary school teachers in various places with opportunities for further study and increase educational effectiveness, hired experts from various fields last semester to run elementary education correspondence classes. Participants included counties and cities in this province, as well as provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Sichuan, and Jiangsu. Later, due to the limited number of places, many teachers from distant places were unable to join. During the summer vacation, they also sent letters requesting it. It is now heard that the school has continued to recruit 500 new students. All courses, such as children's literature, training issues, labor education, singing and teaching, and Chinese, arithmetic, social studies, nature, and other teaching methods, are extremely practical. Considering the hardship of teachers, each person only pays two yuan for lectures and miscellaneous fees. After graduation, those registered with the education bureaus of various counties have been exempted from the examination by the Education Department and ordered to be given priority for employment. It is also heard that the school recently published "Elementary Labor Education," which was carefully written by experts from various places, with rich content and low prices, sufficient for those who study labor education to use as a reference for theory and practice.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Overview of Blind and Deaf Education in This City <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>A total of one school for the blind and four schools for the deaf and mute.</p>
<p>All are elementary schools; secondary schools lack qualified teachers.</p>
<p>Blind and deaf education is a special form of education. China, with its blind and deaf population accounting for one-thousandth of the national population, urgently needs active development in this area. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Education recently issued orders to the education departments of various provinces and cities to investigate the overall situation of blind and deaf education nationwide as a reference for research and to seek pathways for development. Shanghai has witnessed irregular development in education at all levels, from elementary to higher education, but few have paid attention to this special education. To understand the status of blind and deaf education in this city, the reporter made separate visits to various schools for the blind and deaf yesterday. The findings are recorded as follows for the reference of those concerned about blind and deaf education.</p>
<p>One School for the Blind: There were originally two schools for the blind in this city. One was affiliated with the Qunxue Society, founded before the January 28th Incident, with only three students. After one semester, it was suspended due to the January 28th Incident and has not been reopened. The other was founded by a British person on Yidingpan Road, with Fu Lanya as the principal. The number of students is minimal, and the school is not thriving.</p>
<p>Shanghai School for the Deaf and Mute: This school was newly established this semester, located on Zhaojia Road, Ximen. The school board includes Chen Heqin, Zhang Shouyong, and Ou Yuanhuai, among others. The principal is Sun Yusen. Currently, there are five teachers and seventy-five students, making it the most dynamic school for the deaf and mute in this city. Yesterday, the reporter visited the school and was led on a tour by teacher Shi Dianqing. The student dormitory was exceptionally clean, and the classrooms included one each for primary and advanced levels. Various statistical charts were quite detailed. Under Sun's guidance, students demonstrated pronunciation and sign language to the reporter, which was quite interesting. One student, Sun Kerun, had been trained at the Yantai School for the Deaf and Mute for three years and transferred to this school this semester. He speaks like a normal person. The student read the school's regulations to the reporter with clear pronunciation, which was truly remarkable.</p>
<p>Affiliated with Qunxue Society: The school for the deaf and mute affiliated with the Qunxue Society on Zhonghua Road was founded in April of the Republic of China year nine. At that time, it was the only school for the deaf and mute founded by Chinese people. The Municipal Education Bureau subsidizes its expenses with</p>
<p>one hundred yuan per month. Yang Pingyu is the principal. Last semester, there were ninety students, but this semester, the number has decreased to twenty-seven. There are a total of three teachers. The school previously established a vocational program at the junior high level but has now discontinued it. Seven students have graduated, some of whom have become teachers at schools for the deaf and mute, while others work as typists, all contributing to society.</p>
<p>Founded by Foreigners: There are two other schools, one being the Fu Lanya School for the Deaf and Mute on Jisifei Road, established by a British person in September of the Republic of China year fifteen. Fu Lanya is the principal, and there are currently fifty-five students. Another school is the School for the Deaf and Mute attached to the Xujiahui Notre Dame Convent, established by the French Catholic Church. Fei Mumu is the principal, and there are currently twenty-seven students. Founded nine years before the Republic of China, it is the most historically long-standing school for the deaf and mute in this city.</p>
<p>General Survey of the Deaf and Mute: In addition to the four schools in Shanghai, there are more than ten schools for the deaf and mute nationwide, including those in Yantai, Beiping, Nantong, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Zhenjiang. The number of students is approximately four hundred. Although there are no accurate statistics on the number of deaf and mute people nationwide, it is generally estimated that they account for one in every thousand people, totaling as many as 400,000. The causes of deafness and muteness are said to be 60% direct inheritance, 24% indirect inheritance, 12% consanguineous marriage, and 4% ear diseases during speech development.</p>
<p>Severe Shortage of Teachers: According to Mr. Shi of the Shanghai School for the Deaf and Mute, the main reasons why deaf and mute education in China cannot develop are, first, the lack of school funding, and second, the lack of qualified teachers, with the latter being even more critical than the former. In the past, only the Yantai School for the Deaf and Mute established a normal school class, and nothing similar has been heard of elsewhere. Therefore, schools for the deaf and mute in China only have elementary schools, and it is difficult to establish vocational programs at the junior high level or above. It is deeply hoped that the educational community will pay attention to this point.</p>

<p>The development of the world's aviation industry in recent times is astonishing. The "Air Age" is approaching step by step. Japan is currently working hard to enrich and expand its air force, encourage and assist the civil aviation industry, and vigorously revitalize the aviation industry, reversing its previous weakness and showing a trend of surpassing Europe and the United States. Mr. Xu Yuanruo has specially compiled this book for the reference of the Chinese people. The book consists of five chapters, detailing the past, present, and future of Japanese aviation, Japanese air defense, the trans-Pacific problem, juvenile airmen, and other aviation</p>
<p>business, exercises, and other current situations. The content is rich and detailed, and the text is shocking. Recently, the Chinese people have gradually become interested in aviation, and this book is the best reading material to meet this need. The actual price is 25 cents, and it is published by the special distribution department of this newspaper. A special price is offered for one month during the autumn school season. Purchases of ten or more copies are calculated at a 30% discount.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Third China Vocational Supplementary School <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Five departments to be established first... A good opportunity for young people to pursue further education. The China Vocational Education Society previously established the First and Second Supplementary Schools in the concession areas to promote supplementary education, with excellent results. Now, the Third China Vocational Supplementary School is established within the China Vocational School at Lujiabang, Xiaoximen. It will initially offer five departments: mechanical and electrical engineering, architectural and civil engineering drawing, added engineering, Chinese language and writing, and English. Classes are all taught in the evening. Among them, there is a particularly high demand in society for talents in the fields of mechanical and electrical engineering and architectural and civil engineering drawing. The establishment of these two departments by the school not only meets the needs</p>
<p>but is also an innovation among supplementary schools in the country. Moreover, the China Vocational School has complete facilities, such as the mechanical workshop, prime mover testing laboratory, electrical laboratory, and civil engineering research room, all of which are richly equipped. It is said that the existing equipment will be used to provide practical training and testing for supplementary students. It is also heard that the school will start soon, and registrations have been very enthusiastic. Those who request the prospectus should enclose two cents for postage.</p>

<p>New professors for this semester have also been hired.</p>
<p>The National Jiaotong University previously had an Academic Affairs Department, but it was abolished in the Republic of China year nineteen for some reason. After the start of this semester, President Li Zhaohuan considered the Academic Affairs Department to be extremely important and reinstated it. The position of Dean of Academic Affairs will be held in rotation by the deans of each college. Furthermore, the new professors for this semester have been hired, including Hu Gangfu as a full professor of physics, Zhou Yougan and Shen Dezi as teaching assistants in the physics department, Liu Chenglin, Xie Hui, and Shen Zhennan as associate professors in the chemistry department, Fan Huiguo as a full professor in the mathematics department, and more than twenty professors in the School of Management.</p>

<p>Enhancing equipment, scheduled start of classes</p>
<p>Since its reorganization and reform this semester, Jiangnan College in this city has spared no effort in internal consolidation. The specialized programs it has added, such as municipal administration, journalism, land reclamation, and telecommunications administration, have all hired experts to take charge. To better comply with the orders of the Ministry of Education, the college has vigorously enhanced its equipment, such as generators and broadcasting equipment for the telecommunications administration program, all of which have been purchased to provide students with practical research opportunities. The journalism program of the college has also been coordinated by the program director, Tao Baichuan, with major newspapers, allowing students of the program to go for internships to learn from experience. It is also heard that the college has set the official start of classes for the eighteenth of this month and has reserved a small number of places for students from afar who come to Shanghai to take the entrance exam, allowing them to take the exam upon arrival.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Alumni of Nanyang Advanced Business School Petition the Ministry of Education to Commend Wu Xinglian <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Last Saturday evening (August 26th), alumni of the Nanyang Advanced Business School in this city held the fourth alumni reunion dinner at the YMCA in the French Concession, with a large number of attendees. After the dinner, alumni Yang Yingcong and others proposed that Principal Wu Xinglian founded Nanyang Business School in the Republic of China year nine, sacrificing his family wealth to do so, for fourteen years. During the January 28th Incident, the entire school was destroyed, with significant losses. Not only was Principal Wu not discouraged by this, but he also worked harder to continue the school, gradually restoring it to its former glory in less than a year. Moreover, he has been stationed at the school year-round, focusing on education, handling all matters, big and small, personally, correcting the modern malpractice of nominal principals. Therefore, they initiated a joint petition to the Ministry of Education for commendation. Yesterday, Lou Weitao, a graduate of the first class of the school, submitted the petition, which was signed and sealed by all the alumni, directly to the Ministry of Education in the capital, requesting appropriate commendation in accordance with the regulations on commending individuals who donate funds to establish schools and the regulations on lifelong education service.</p>

<p>Rockefeller Foundation to Hold a Meeting in November</p>

<p>Rockefeller, the American oil tycoon, previously agreed to the request of the Chinese Red Cross Hospital and others to donate the land of the Chinese baseball field on Jin Shenfu Road in Shanghai, worth more than three million yuan, to rebuild the Zhongshan Hospital. The Chinese side entrusted Yan Fuqing, the president of the Red Cross Hospital, to take charge of the matter, actively planning and raising funds. The construction was originally scheduled to begin in August or September after autumn. According to Mr. Fang, although the proposal has been approved by Rockefeller, it has not yet been formally approved by the Rockefeller Foundation Committee in New York. The committee was originally scheduled to meet in August of this year but has now been rescheduled to November. Therefore, the formal reception of the site will have to wait until after November, and the construction date will also have to be changed slightly, probably starting in the spring of next year. As for the funding, it is planned to raise one million yuan, and 500,000 yuan has already been raised, with considerable arrangements for the remaining amount.

<p>— Yu Ming</p>
<p>On the night of August 30th, there was a sudden crackling sound from far and near. For a moment, I didn't have time to think about it and thought that the "resistance" had started again. Soon I understood that it was setting off firecrackers, and then I made up my mind. Then I thought: Is it some kind of solar term again? ... When I saw the newspaper the next day, I realized that last night was a lunar eclipse, and those crackling sounds were our compatriots and non-compatriots (although we all claim to be descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the descendants of Chi You must not have died out, so they are called "non-compatriots"), trying to save the moon from the mouth of the heavenly dog.</p>
<p>A few days before that, the nights were also very lively. Tables were set up everywhere in the streets and alleys, with noodles and watermelons covered with flies, green worms, mosquitoes, and the like. There was also a table of monks chanting: "Hui Zhu Luo Pumi Ya Hong! Om Ya Hong! Hong!" This was releasing flame mouths and performing the ghost feeding ceremony. It was the Ghost Festival, and ghosts and non-ghosts alike ran out from the underworld to see the big world of Shanghai. Benevolent men and women took this opportunity to fulfill their duties as hosts, entrusting the monks to "Om Ya Hong" and flick a few grains of white rice, asking them to eat their fill.</p>
<p>I am a layman and have never paid much attention to the sky and the underworld, but every time this happens, I can't help but feel the transcendence and appropriateness of the thoughts of our compatriots and non-compatriots who are still in the human world. Not to mention anything else, in less than two whole years, the flags of four provinces, or as small as nine islands, have changed. Not only can they not be saved, but even if one wanted to save them, the situation would not allow it. Therefore, the most appropriate thing to do is to save the moon. Even if the firecrackers are set off with a deafening sound, the heavenly dog will never come to bite, and the chief in the moon (if there is a chief) will not come out to forbid it. It is the same with saving people. There are countless victims of war, drought, and locust plagues. How can the common people who are temporarily spared from disaster have a way to save them? Naturally, it is far better to save souls, which is less work and more meritorious, the same as the merit of the Grand Master's Daoist rituals and building pagodas. This is the so-called "If a man does not think far ahead, he will have immediate worries; and the superior man attends to what is great and distant," which is what this means.</p>
<p>Moreover, "Although the cook does not manage the kitchen, the ritual officer does not overstep the sacred vessels to replace him," is also the clear instruction of the ancient sages. State affairs are for the rulers to manage; the common people do not</p>
<p>need to make a fuss. However, the wise emperors and enlightened kings of the past did not despise the common people, but gave them more transcendent freedom and rights, that is, to listen to you specializing in saving the universe and souls. This is the foundation of peace. From ancient times to the present, it has been followed without fail, and it is expected that it will not</p>
<p>be abolished easily in the future. I remember that it was last year, when the Shanghai war had just stopped, and the Japanese soldiers gradually boarded the warships and retreated into the barracks. One night, there was also such a crackling sound. It was still in the midst of the "long-term resistance." The Japanese did not understand our national essence and thought that the tens of thousands of troops had come to recover the lost land. They immediately put up guards and dispatched troops ... There was a commotion, only to realize that we were saving the moon, and they were seeing ghosts. "Oh, oh! Natuboto, that's how it is"! After exclaiming and admiring, they returned to their peaceful state. This year, they didn't even put up guards, probably because they have been influenced by China's spiritual civilization.</p>
<h3 id="e236">"The World I See" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>I live on an upper floor, with the windows facing the XX Hospital. Looking down from the window, the first thing that catches my eye is a row of low, tiled-roofed buildings within the hospital grounds, which turn out to be the mortuary. I've always been timid, afraid of anything related to "death." In the countryside, coffins and graves were, needless to say, what I avoided most. Even funeral processions and ancestral temples often made me uneasy. Unexpectedly, this time my residence happened to be so close to a place where death frequently comes and goes. For the first few days, I was very worried, fearing that my heart would never find peace.</p>
<p>Yet, strangely, things didn't turn out as I expected. I've lived here for a full month, and I haven't felt the slightest unease about this transient place of death. I lean out of the window every day, seeing that row of low, tiled-roofed buildings, and often watching lifeless bodies being carried out of them. Yet, I haven't felt a bit of fear. I even enjoy gazing out the window every day, finding solace for my weariness.</p>
<p>This is strange, but I know its origin. Could it be that the hospital did this intentionally? They planted a row of trees behind the mortuary, and then built a fence behind the trees, thus separating the black shed from the building where I live. I don't know the names of those trees. They are leafy, with slender trunks, yet quite tall, taller than the three-story building where I live, so they are very slender, like a modern woman with a small waist. Whenever there's a breeze, they sway gracefully, rustling softly. I suspect they are poplars. Even if they aren't poplars, I'm willing to consider them poplars, because that is very poetic.</p>
<p>The poetic quality is indeed considerable. This row of poplar-like trees, right in front of my window, creates a green curtain. Peeking through the gaps, there are the ancient, elegant black tiles of the roof and the mysterious white cross on the roof, the red walls opposite, the blue sky above...</p>
<p>All this, though it hasn't inspired me to compose any poems, has indeed pleased my eyes and soothed my mind, like gazing at a natural landscape. At least, the black shed, which forms part of the scenery, has completely lost its meaning as a mortuary to me. Even when I often see corpses being carried out, I just regard it as an embellishment to the scenery.</p>
<p>This is a miracle: transforming a fearful and miserable realm into a beautiful and solemn scene. But I know this is due to the "blinding trick" of that row of trees.</p>
<p>Could it be that the hospital did this intentionally? But no matter what, this row of trees is a great gift to me and to the tenants of this three-story building who will come after me, a magic weapon that allows us to find joy in a terrifying realm. I am very grateful to the hospital for planting these trees. I am grateful for more than just this. I am also grateful for the great lesson they have given me, making me realize that all the sufferings of the world can be relieved by "blinding tricks." Natural disasters, man-made calamities, and national crises pile up, yet the people are still cheerful as if ascending a spring terrace. It's not really that they lack passion, but that there are too many things that obscure their view. The earth's fire runs underground, but as long as wild grass grows above, it will make people forget the danger of eruption.</p>
<p>However, there are those whose eyes are covered, those who create their own blinders, and those who simply close their eyes... Different people, each with "the world I see." And the true, objective world is ignored.</p>
<p>The phrase "the world I see," used here, is the title of a book published last year by Emil Ludwig. I have a French translation of this book, which contains this passage about ears and eyes:</p>
<p>"The ear is a woman; when she listens, she is passive. The eye is a man; when he looks, he is able to be independent. Therefore, when the eye does not want to see, he will use the natural method: close. If the ear does not want to hear, it must depend on the artificial method (using both hands to cover them)." This is very true. When my gaze is focused on the beautiful "scenery," ignoring the mortuary, my ears cannot refuse the intrusion of the mournful cries coming from the mortuary. Whenever the night is deep and quiet, the rustling of the leaves of those poplar-like trees often evokes in me a terror and sorrow for death.</p>
<p>After the eyes are covered, we suffer from still having hearing, which allows us to vaguely know the situation of the real world.</p>
<p>Although I also have two hands, for some reason, I never have the courage to raise them to cover my ears.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Further Discussion on Ma Zhiyuan <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Zhenduo wrote an article "Ma Zhiyuan's Zaju" in the Free Talk on the 9th, believing that my "The Embryo of Ma Zhiyuan's Zaju" written in July had two errors: (1) Ma's four Xiaoling poems are not necessarily written before the Zaju; therefore, they are not necessarily the embryo of the Zaju. (2) "Meng Haoran Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow" was not written by Ma Zhiyuan. I am very happy that he gave me this opportunity so that I can explain my conjecture.</p>
<p>On the first point, I still maintain my original idea that the Xiaoling came first, and the Zaju came later. There are two reasons: (1) The first "Four Pieces of Jade Xunyang River" is not much different from Bai Juyi's "Pipa Ballad." Xunyang River says:</p>
<p>Seeing off guests, the autumn river is cold, the merchant girl's pipa wails. Knowing that Sima listened with sorrow. The moon is bright, the wine is sobering, the guest is awakening. This poem adopted the original meaning of the "Pipa Ballad." The original poem "Pipa Ballad" says:</p>
<p>At Xunyang Riverhead, seeing off guests at night, tree leaves and reed catkins rustle in the autumn wind... Turning the peg and plucking the strings two or three times... a special kind of melancholy and deep hatred arises... Only the white autumn moon can be seen on the river... Jiangzhou Sima's green shirt is wet.</p>
<p>It can be seen that Ma Zhiyuan at that time did not yet have any literary fantasy imagination, but only adopted the poetic meaning for the song. When he wrote "Green Shirt Tears," it was not the same. He let go and added many love</p>
<p>plots out of thin air, completely deviating from the scope of the original poem. If Ma Zhiyuan had first written such arbitrary imagination or borrowing wine to relieve sorrow and creating something out of nothing "Green Shirt Tears," it seems that he would not write such a restrained "Xunyang River," right? As for the Xiaoling being short and enough to develop the Zaju, that is secondary. (2) If "Xunyang River" was written before "Green Shirt Tears," then the remaining two "Four Pieces of Jade" must have been written before "Green Shirt Tears," because in "Taiping Yuefu," these three are placed close together and are all titled with place names (Tiantai Road, Zizhi Road), and should be works of the same period. Moreover, these three are all "Four Pieces of Jade" and are all stories of the Zaju that Ma Zhiyuan wrote, so I cannot help but arouse suspicion and speculation. In addition, what Mr. Zheng said, that the Xiaoling of the Yuan people chanting Chen Bo and Meng Haoran, and the Xiaoling of the Yuan and Ming people singing the story of Cui Zhang, are not the embryos of Ma Zhiyuan and Wang Bao's operas; it only increases the rhetoric. In fact, I have never said that other people's Xiaoling are the embryos of Ma Zhiyuan's Zaju, and there is no need to use this kind of comparison.</p>
<p>On the second point, I also saw him say this in Zheng's History of Chinese Literature, page 872: "The Xiji Zi Zaju Selection also contains his book 'Meng Haoran Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow,' but that was written by Zhu Zhouxian, King of Zhou, in the Ming Dynasty, not by him." Recently, he said in Free Talk: "We cannot find a play called 'Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow' in the most ancient records of the Record of Ghosts and the Taihe Zheng Yin Pu in Ma's drama list." But I</p>
<p>checked the "Taihe Zheng Yin Pu" reproduced by the Ancient Books Circulation Office, page 12, line 6 of the upper volume, under the "Zaju Compiled by Qunying" Ma Zhiyuan entry, there is the play title "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow." (The preface of the Yuan Qu Selection and Liang Tingnan's Qu Hua both quote it) The Qu Yuan edition of Zhong Sicheng's Lu Gui Bu, page 9 of the Six Arts Book Bureau, also has "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow." Chen Naigan's Qu Lu School Supplement in the 10th issue of Jian Shang Zhou Kan (August 1925) said: "Or it is said that Meng Haoran Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow should be attributed to Yuan Ma Zhiyuan according to the Yishi Garden Catalog. However, many Zaju titles of Yuan and Ming people are the same, or slightly embellished, or the plot is changed. For example, the Qu Jiang Chi of Cheng Qi Yuefu is also written by Shi Junshi of Yuan, with the same name but different Guanmu." He said that "Guanmu is actually different" means admitting that Ma has another script writing about the same event. In the same example, the ending of the fourth act of Ma</p>
<p>Zhiyuan's "Liu Ruan Mistakenly Entering Taoyuan Cave" (recorded in the Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu and Taihe Zheng Yin Pu) cannot be found in Wang Ziyi's "Liu Chen Ruan Zhao Mistakenly Entering Taoyuan." I think that if the "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow" selected by Xiji Zi is completely the same as that of Zhou Xianwang, then Ma's is probably lost, so Xiji Zi came to a case of Zhang Guan Li Dai after reading books such as Lu Gui Bu and Taihe Zheng Yin Pu, which is not necessarily a "familiar reading of Xiaoling." Wang Guowei clearly stated under the entry "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow": "Taihe Zheng Yin Pu" has this book." I think this may be a temporary oversight error by Mr. Zheng. Taihe Zheng Yin Pu recorded only thirteen kinds of Ma Zhiyuan's Zaju, including "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow." Removing the collaborative "Yellow Millet Dream" from Qu Lu and adding "Meng Haoran Riding a Donkey in the Snow" and ("Ren Fengzi") only yields fourteen kinds. Mr. Zheng said in the History of Chinese Literature that Ma's Zaju has "fourteen books" (page 869). If "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow" is not included, I am afraid that the number cannot be made up, right?</p>

<p>— Written by Joseph Conrad, Translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>In the dim light of the house, he saw a woman lying supine on a bamboo bed, under a wide red cotton quilt. She lay quietly, like a dead person; but her big eyes, wide open, flashed in the dark, her eyes were still, as if she couldn’t see anything, staring at the beams on the roof. She had a very high fever and was obviously unconscious. Her cheeks were slightly sunken, her lips were half-open, and a sinister death-like expression appeared on her young face—the unintentional contemplation and dazed expression of a dying person. The two men looked down at her in silence.</p>
<p>"Has she been sick for a long time?" asked the traveler.</p>
<p>"I haven't slept for five nights," the Malay answered in a deep voice. "At first she heard voices calling her in the water. I held her, and she struggled in my arms. But since this morning, she can't hear anything anymore—she can't even hear my voice. She can't see anything anymore. Not even me—she can't even see me!"</p>
<p>He was silent for a while, then asked softly: "Tuan, will she die?"</p>
<p>"Maybe," said the white man sadly. He had known Assat for many years, in a faraway country, in a dangerous and turbulent period, when any friendship was precious. Later, his Malay friend unexpectedly lived in this shallow lake cabin with a strange woman. He had stayed here many times during his journey along this river. He liked this native because he knew how to keep his word and how to stand by his white friend and fight fearlessly. He loved him, perhaps as a person loves his beloved dog, but he could still give him aid and love him without any expectation, even in his own busy career, he would vaguely think of this lonely man hiding in the forest with fear and the long-haired, arrogant-looking woman with a pair of victorious eyes.</p>
<p>The white man walked out of the cabin, just in time to see a black, turbulent cloud rising between the treetops, and the shadow that came quickly and stealthily spread across the sky, diluting the deep red of the floating clouds and the red light of the end of the day, and annihilating the huge flames of the setting sun. After a while, stars appeared in the thick darkness of the earth, and the shallow lake, shimmering with starlight, was like an oval night sky cast into a desolate wilderness of dismal black night. The white husband took out some dinner food from the basket, gathered some branches scattered on the platform, and lit a small fire, not for warmth, but to drive away mosquitoes with the smoke. He wrapped his body in a blanket, sat there leaning against the reed wall of the house, and smoked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Assat walked out of the door without a sound and squatted beside the fire. The white man moved his outstretched legs.</p>
<p>"She is panting," Assat said softly. "She is panting and feels like she is being burned by a big fire. She doesn't speak, she doesn't listen, just the fire burns!"</p>
<p>He paused for a while, then asked quietly and indifferently: "Tuan...will she die?"</p>
<p>The white man moved his shoulder uneasily, and murmured hesitantly, as if hesitating: "If that is her fate."</p>
<p>"No, Tuan," Assat said calmly. "If that is my fate. I listen, I watch, I wait and wait. I remember...Tuan, do you remember the old days? Do you remember my brother?"</p>

<h3 id="e239">Gold and Silver Prices Rebound One Dollar and Ten Cents <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Silver and Commodity Prices Rise and Fall</p>
<p>Short Covering Near Expiry Results in Rebound</p>
<p>After a downward trend in the gold market since the previous day, yesterday, the overseas telegraph reported that both the British and American silver markets rose, the British and American exchange rates increased by 2.625 points, the American and British exchange rates increased by 2.375 points, the forward silver price on the Metal Exchange increased by 5.2 to 6.5 points, the private telegram silver price increased by 5.625 points, American cotton increased by 20 pounds, stocks increased by 4.17 dollars, American wheat increased by 3 points, and the London spot gold price decreased by 5 pence. The gross price immediately broke through 20 dollars and continued to retreat to 15 dollars, but it recovered due to large buyers taking advantage of the low price to buy in. After opening, it once again broke through the 20-dollar mark, but it gradually rose due to the healthy appetite of the banks. Although it slightly declined afterward, it mostly hovered. Retail customers squeezed prices, once decreasing to 20 dollars, but the noon closing price remained stable. The after-market was boosted by a Reuters report stating that US President Roosevelt gathered officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Federal Reserve Board, and other figures to discuss the need for banks to expand lending under the economic recovery plan, and that banks had already lent to the industrial sector. There were also rumors that coal industry regulations had progressed. Banks were blocked and broke through 20 dollars, but it gradually stabilized due to eager short covering. Finally, as the banks' appetite turned sluggish, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing the price to rise further. The price for ready delivery increased by 265 dollars. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 820 dollars, a decrease of 3.6 dollars compared to the previous closing price. Commodity openings were at the same price.

After that, trading was sluggish, but the situation gradually declined. Fuchang, Hengxing Yuan, etc. sold, retreating to within one dollar, as the Central Exchange Bureau sought to block US dollars. Daxing Yongruikang sold, once falling to 20 dollars. Near noon, Hongli</p>
<p>and others entered the market, and special items rose again. The noon closing price rebounded to 822.7 dollars. After the closing, Ruikang entered, but Wan Yu and others all sold, decreasing to within two dollars. Commodity prices were auctioned at 2.5 dollars in the morning.</p>
<p>The after-market opening price was 21.8 dollars, with commodities at 1.3 dollars. Dadecheng entered at 2.4 dollars. Daxing Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Richang Zhengchang, Zifeng, Yong, etc. all competed to sell. Negative overseas telegraph news caused it to decrease to 18.5 dollars. Hengyu, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Yifeng Yong, etc. took advantage of the low price to purchase, and rebounded to 21.4 dollars. Well released November half dollar. The Bombay telegram reported an increase of five annas, still retreating to within 20 dollars. Later, Yingfeng Heng entered to over one dollar, but Yuanchun exited. Huabi sold December US dollars at 6875 points to Zhengjin Bank. The situation hovered. After hovering, the Bombay telegram reported a small decrease of one anna. Zhengchang Hengyu, Zhaofeng Chang, Fuchang Yifeng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. all entered the market. December US dollars, even at a large price of 25, also proved difficult to settle, and in a rush it reached 5.5 dollars. Commodity supply retreated to within 4 dollars. Mitsui released December US dollars at 5625 points. Hengxing Yuan Mao Yong still took in the closing price at 824.8 dollars. The initial after-closing price was setback, and then rose to over 5 dollars, due to Bingxing buying in. Commodity prices were auctioned at 5.5 dollars. It was found that the highest price of the day was 825.5 dollars and the lowest price was 818.1 dollars, with a fluctuation of 7.4 dollars. As a result, it rebounded 1.2 dollars compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The listed price increased by 375 points for HSBC Bank's US exchange rate, to 28.625 dollars, corresponding to a standard gold price of over 838 dollars.

<p>The financial situation in the market yesterday was slightly calmer compared to the previous few days.

<p>New Government Bond Rumors Dominate</p>
<p>The Bond Market Lingers, Ending Slightly Better</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw slight changes in trends. Generally speaking, each trading board experienced a slight increase. The standard for current rises and falls is focused on whether new government bonds will be issued. There is much debate in the market, with some saying that 120 million in new government bonds will be issued to make up for financial shortfalls. However, those familiar with the inside story believe that issuing new government bonds would be extremely difficult to unload, and the benefits to the government would be limited. Therefore, it is unlikely that things will develop in this way. Speculation abounds, but for many days, most have believed that selling short is advisable. The number of short sellers in the market has gradually increased, creating a crowding effect. A slight rebound immediately leads to a rise. The first trading board was generally stable with a slight increase, but unified salt tax bonds were still being sold, falling by 5 to 20 cents. The second trading board was initially chaotic, with ups and downs, but the volume was very small. Unified salt tax bonds rebounded by about 10 cents. Although the 31st series and others were still being sold, buyers gradually emerged. The afternoon opening saw a unanimous increase of 10 to 20 cents, and the closing remained firm, continuing to improve by 10 to 20 cents. As a result, except for the 1929 Customs bonds, which were slightly down by 5 cents, the rest rebounded by 10 to 55 cents. Judging from the overall trend, there are many short positions, and there may be a possibility of continued increases. The total transaction volume was 6,216,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot transactions. The unified salt tax futures totaled 2,770,000 yuan, demobilization bonds accounted for 760,000 yuan, the 1929 Customs bonds totaled 365,000 yuan, the 2020 Customs bonds totaled 1,140,000 yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to one or two hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Industrial Stocks Quite Optimistic</p>
<p>A Shin Feng &amp; Co. report stated that on the 11th, the New York stock market rose by $1 to $9 due to the decline in the U.S. dollar and optimism about the future of major industries. Talk of inflation has revived, and the stock market seems poised to continue to perform well without significant obstacles. Liquor stocks were strong because four states are expected to abolish alcohol prohibition this week. Starting on Saturday, the sugar and coffee exchanges will be closed indefinitely. The total daily transaction volume was 1,920,000 shares. Wheat buyers purchased enthusiastically, disregarding all news, due to the strong stock market. Cotton prices rose sharply due to talk of inflation. Although the cotton market itself cannot be considered good for buyers, the possibility of inflation, the government's efforts to restrict cotton fields, and other market developments have stimulated purchasing power. Many Southern sellers are still hedging, waiting to buy back in. Silver closed very strong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed below:</p>

<p>Raw Cotton Prices Decline Across the Board</p>
<p>The yarn market is very sluggish, but foreign cotton prices are rising and exchange rates are lengthening, resulting in a flat mood. Furthermore, most people are inclined to sell, causing the market to decline. As for actual demand, merchants in South China are actively purchasing, but the market has not been stimulated due to the poor environment, mostly due to expectations of falling prices.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Man-Made Fiber and Cotton Fall <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai man-made fiber market opened with a good situation due to rising U.S. cotton prices, but weakened after the 23rd board, with more sellers. Prices for each month fell by 3, 5, and 7 cents. The afternoon sentiment remained soft, with prices for each month falling by 3, 4, 5, and 7 cents. The total daily transaction volume was 33,000 bales. Sales included 2,000 bales from Dafeng, 800 bales from Jifeng, 850 bales from Yuanda, 900 bales from Taichang, and 1,100 bales from Xiesheng. Purchases included 1,250 bales from Rongxing, 700 bales from Yuanda, 1,600 bales from Renfeng, 1,000 bales from Dachang, and 850 bales from Huachang. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Man-Made Fiber Closing Prices, Rise/Fall Open Interest</p>

<p>Spot yarn is being cleared, and purchases from the South Road are more active. It is estimated that various trading houses purchased a total of 1,190 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 5 cents. The purchase amounts for each trading house are as follows: Yunnan 830, Northern houses 35, Jiangxi 5, Guangdong 25, Wuhu traders 20, inland 145, Ningbo 25, Sichuan 20.</p>
<p>The cotton market was firm in the morning and tired in the afternoon. The market situation is still manageable because shipments from various locations are not strong and prices in the producing areas are difficult to be cheap. The local selling price in Tongzhou is 40.04 yuan, which requires adding 2 yuan for water transportation fees to Shanghai, making it more expensive than Shanghai. However, the arrival of Yaozhou cotton from Ningbo houses is more active, and prices are slightly cheaper, which has overwhelmed market sentiment. Spot cotton sales have been good recently due to the thin inventories of various factories.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Zheng Cotton Falls by Two Cents <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>The Zheng cotton market opened with U.S. cotton rebounding by 20 points, but the gold market fell again, so there were not many buyers. By the 23rd board, there was heavy rain. Currently, it is a critical moment for cotton harvesting, and the weather is very important. Buyers were active, and prices rose by 5 to 10 cents. In the afternoon, the weather cleared up, Ningbo sold short, and the market fell again by 1 to 2.5 cents. The total daily transaction volume was 93,800 dan. Sales included 6,000 dan from Changfeng, 2,800 dan from Dachang, 2,000 dan from Suijiang, 1,700 dan from Yuanda, and 1,600 dan from Yuanxingchang.

<h3 id="e251">August Sees Strong Sales of Japanese Yarn in Shanghai <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>丨丨Influence of Rising Prices of Three-Grade Yarn丨丨</p>
<p>At the end of last month, the inventory of Japanese yarn in this port, although not thoroughly investigated, was approximately 10,000 bales less than the inventory at the end of July (34,000 bales). This was due to the surge in the price of three-grade yarn at the beginning of last month. Trading houses from the Northeast and Tianjin purchased very actively, with approximately 3,500 bales of 16s and 20s yarn being sold. Later, demand in various regions weakened, and the price of yarn fell along with the decline in the Chinese cotton market. In the middle of the month, U.S. cotton rebounded, and Tianjin houses began to purchase again, leading to competitive buying from various trading houses in Qingdao, Hankou, and this port. As a result, the situation changed dramatically, and the market price soared, with more than 15,000 bales being transacted. By the end of the month, the price of three-grade yarn rose again, and Japanese companies purchased 8,000 bales from Japanese factories in Shanghai. Therefore, the strong sales of Japanese yarn in the middle of last month were unprecedented in recent months, and a sharp reduction in inventory can be predicted.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was strong due to Wall Street support, and buyers bought on the rebound. The market was firm and active. As a result, spot prices rose by 20 points, and futures prices rose by 20 to 23 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices fall by 4 points and futures prices fall by 4 to 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 6 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to short covering and speculative buying, but later weakened due to selling by exporters and small Japanese traders. As a result, Pingar rose by 2 rupees, Omra rose by 1 rupee and 7.5 annas, and Bairohi rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 11th):</p>

<p>Fragrant Japonica Rice is Now on the Market</p>
<p>The Goods are Clean, Fragrant, and the Price Opens at 7.80 Yuan</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 70 sources, and both wholesale and retail appetites were similar to before. However, with the continued influx of goods, sentiment weakened further, so the situation was flat. In total, Yantai trading houses had more than 1,000 packages, and the prices of other thick japonica rice, thin indica rice, Duyang new pointed rice, etc., continued to decline by more than a dime. The exchange rate changed from negative to fixed. The prices of new inland river japonica rice were not significantly different, and the prices of new Shandong rice remained unchanged. As for inland river fragrant japonica rice, it was launched yesterday. The goods are clean and fragrant. Since the first day is still the first day, customers are competing to buy them, so the market is quite lively and the price opens at 7.80 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were approximately 37-38 sources from various river routes. Sales in the market were sluggish due to the intermittent cloudy and sunny weather, so appetites were light. The price of white japonica rice was slightly down, the price of early thin indica rice was slightly down by nearly a dime, the price of new Yang pointed and round pointed rice was slightly down by a dime, and the price of new Bu pointed rice was down by about two dimes. The prices of old Yang pointed, Du pointed, new and old Ke pointed, and new Dong japonica rice were stable. The exchange rate was flat and sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e256">New Ke Indica Rice Continues to Rise, Up by a Dime or So <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The Ke indica rice market was very good yesterday because only the railway route has arrivals recently. Although Hunan rice transported by boat has arrived, it is all sold at a limited price due to high costs. The producers are concerned that arrivals will be difficult to be strong in the future due to unfavorable production prices. Foreign rice prices have also been raised by the cargo owners, but traders have not been able to close deals due to high asking prices. However, Ke rice merchants have a strong appetite because they are unable to trade Hunan and foreign rice smoothly, so they are paying more attention to Nanjing railway indica rice. Quanzhou merchants from Fujian province have the strongest appetite. Yesterday, merchants from Beiyang also arrived in the city to test-buy more than 100 packages of new Nanjing indica rice. Merchants from Wenzhou and Taizhou, who have not purchased for a long time, also inquired about Nanjing brown rice yesterday. Therefore, the market situation is very good. The price of brown rice rose by a dime, and the price of polished rice rose by five cents. Currently, the total inventory of new Ke indica rice is approximately 10,000 packages. If Ke demand is strong again today and tomorrow, the market will still need to take steps.</p>

<p>New substitute price for this month is 2.2125 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning with rising prices due to strong actual sales the previous day and foreign wheat prices rising by one yuan. Sentiment was upward, and short positions were covered. Prices for each month in the near term rose by several cents, and prices for more distant months were also stable. However, inventories were full, and the sales of more than 100,000 packages did not help. Furthermore, sales to customers did not continue to be strong, and the market was volatile, further weakening sentiment. Fuxin and other major factories took the opportunity to sell, and short selling in the near term was even stronger. As customers and new short sellers saw factories selling off, they also competed to sell more distant months. Therefore, prices for all months, near and far, plunged across the board. The new low price of 2.2125 yuan was seen again for this month. The closing prices for September and October were down by a penny and a half, November was down by a penny and three-quarters, and December and January were each down by a penny.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Wheat Prices Fall Following Flour Prices <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign telegrams reported that wheat prices rose by about one yuan, and spot wheat inventories and arrivals were both low, making it difficult to lower prices. Therefore, sentiment was very good, and some short positions were covered. Prices for each month were showing signs of prosperity. Following the sudden drop in flour prices, traders hedged their standard contracts for this month, and all had plans to deliver spot. Therefore, sentiment weakened again, and the contract for this month was sold off by traders. The closing price for this month was suddenly down by four cents, the next month was down by two cents, and November and December were each down by one cent. The opening prices for spot wheat were 3.60 yuan for Liuhe wheat and 3.50 yuan for Yangzhou Zhenjiang wheat. It is estimated that 4,500 packages were purchased by Fuxin. Recent arrivals and inventories of spot wheat are both low, so the market is more stable than futures.</p>

<p>In the miscellaneous grains market, the various goods that rely on sales to foreign merchants have no development. Sesame, which has the strongest sales, has recently become even more deserted. Cowpeas are also dismal and lifeless. Although some small traders from Dongbang purchased more than 200 packages of Jiangbei sorted cowpeas yesterday (price opened at 5.45 yuan), there are still more than 10,000 packages in inventory. With such sluggish sales, it will be difficult to recover for a while.</p>

<p>Raw and White Sugar Continue to Fall by Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened due to falling silver prices, longer Dutch exchange rates, and lower customs gold prices. The association set the price for ordinary grade 24 raw and white sugar at 21.50 yuan, down 5 cents from the previous day. There were no transactions for grade 20 medium white sugar. Dutch red sugar also fell by 5 cents, with PK marked at 16.60 yuan. Taikoo sugar also turned down, with B marked at 21.70 yuan and CW marked at 21.60 yuan. The prices for refined sugar from the Chinese Guohua factory were 25.40 yuan for crystal sugar, down 2 cents from the previous day, 24 yuan for number 1 sugar, 23.80 yuan for number 2 sugar, and 23.10 yuan for number 3 sugar, each down by 1 cent from the previous day. The prices for premium grade powdered sugar were 20.75 yuan, 20.55 yuan for number 1, 20.35 yuan for number 2, 20.15 yuan for number 3, and 19.95 yuan for number 4. According to a letter from Shantou, the inventory of Chaoqing sugar is extremely scarce, and local prices are very firm. If you want to pick up Zhuangqing, you must pay 16.30 yuan, so the local sugar houses have high expectations and are unwilling to budge, resulting in a lack of transactions.</p>

<p>The price of new Hainan dried longan opened at 51 yuan the day before yesterday, and the trend was slightly tight. Yesterday, both the North and South markets saw scattered sales, and the price suddenly rose by 5 yuan, reaching 55 yuan, with signs of approaching 60 yuan.</p>

<p>Cocoon Prices Soar, Silk Sales Plummet</p>
<p>(New Autumn Cocoon Prices Soar in Nanxun) This year, silkworms in Nanxun are all raised using improved breeds, so cocoon production is better and fresh cocoon prices are also high. Cocoon exchanges have been open for many days, and arrivals in the market are not weak. Cocoon merchants are competing to collect high-quality cocoons, and cocoon prices have soared, with the highest at 48 yuan and the lowest at 35 yuan.</p>
<p>(New York Raw Silk Imports Decline Sharply) The New York silk weaving factories have been experiencing strikes since the middle of last month, greatly reducing raw silk consumption and causing imports to plummet. Last month (i.e., August), a total of only 46,683 packages of raw silk were imported from various countries. The import volume for the previous month (i.e., July) was 62,348 packages, and in August of last year, it was 61,412 packages, a sharp decrease of 15,000-16,000 packages.</p>
<p>(Sales of Artificial Silk are Still Not Weak) Yesterday, traders from the Yangtze River area continued to trade artificial silk, throwing 55 cases of futures for green bell, golden unicorn, and flying horse brands for September and October on the exchange at prices ranging from 179.50 yuan to 165.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Silk Sales in Europe and America Plummet) The European and American raw silk markets are sluggish, factory sales are slow, and silk prices are slightly down, in a state of continuous decline. American silk merchants are holding onto goods with no inquiries, and they are nitpicking about the raw silk deliveries from Chinese merchants, often lowering prices or even breaking contracts. The future of American sales is increasingly bleak. Although European traders are covering short positions and trading, opening prices are increasingly weak. Yesterday, only Renji and others traded 25 packages of yellow and white factory silk, and prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Wuyuan Zhenmei European Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign telegrams led British merchants Jinjiang, Xiehe, and others, as well as the China Tea Company, to actively trade Wuyuan Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea. More than 1,000 boxes were traded throughout the city, with top-grade opening at 150 yuan and core-extract at 205 yuan, unchanged from before. Gongxi green tea, Baitou merchants, and the Russian Cooperative Society all had demand, but due to the thin inventory in the market, the market has a bullish trend. Transactions for other varieties such as Zhenmei, Xiumei, and Ruimei have also become more active, but the selling prices for goods with inferior quality have fallen by 4-5 yuan to 7-8 yuan.</p>

<p>American Galvanized Iron Sales are Smooth</p>
<p>The American galvanized iron market has been very good recently because Fuzhou and Shantou traders have been making bulk purchases, and there has also been some activity along the Yangtze River Road. Although there is plenty of standard-grade iron in stock and prices have not fallen, it still stands out compared to other goods. The current opening prices are 18.50 yuan per bundle for grade 24, 19.50 yuan for grade 26, 21.50 yuan for grade 28, and 19.75 yuan for 48 sheets. It is said that a total of 270-280 bundles were traded yesterday. Arrivals are said to be scarce, so the future of the market is still promising.</p>

<h3 id="e265">People are Not as Good as Ghosts - Person <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the area under the overpass, where beggars lay like zombies every night, was frighteningly dark and eerie. But tonight is different. The electric lights shine brighter than white paper, and this "old but not dead is a thief" old man can barely open his eyes. In addition to the bright electric lights, there's also a stage. They say they're going to do something called "Tanhuang" later. The words "Tanhuang" are quite unfamiliar to me. A year ago, I had never been to this so-called "ten-mile foreign concession" of Shanghai from my village. I had only heard of Shanghai's "Bund" and "foreign coppers" -- those famous portraits of "foreign masters." "Tanhuang" is a new word that I'm hearing for the first time in my life. I think to myself, since this stage is set up under the overpass, surely I can watch it for free. Driven by curiosity, I steel myself and wait to see what the civilization of Shanghai, the authentic ten-mile foreign concession, is like, something that my village doesn't have.</p>
<p>The hour and minute hands pass by, and the minute hand is already pointing at twelve. My old eyes are really tired, but the thought of the strangely new word "Tanhuang" makes me feel a bit more awake. Just then, I quickly see a man and a woman go up on stage to perform. After listening for a long time, all I hear are things related to "men and women," things that people in my village are absolutely forbidden to talk about. There's nothing else. Ah... so-called "Tanhuang" is just this. I dare not learn any more. I think to myself, people pay money to have these guys, who are neither actors nor anything else, perform such "obscene" acts. What's the point?</p>
<p>When I get to my doorstep, I hear my eldest granddaughter arguing that she wants to go out to see the "Tanhuang" that's going on over there. My daughter-in-law says, "How can a girl watch that kind of 'Tanhuang'? Only lowlifes watch that." I hear all this, and I don't say a word. I think to myself that she's a good daughter-in-law, knowing that "Tanhuang" isn't worth watching and forbidding her daughter from going. This is truly a blessing for our family. I drag a friend from the same alley and ask him, "What's going on over there? Why is it so lively?" "It's the Ghost Festival in July, a Taoist rite. Because the living are too 'poor' now, the dead are naturally also very 'poor'. So when the hungry ghosts are released from hell in July, they really need everyone to donate some money to buy tinfoil and burn it into 'silver' for them. Now, they're putting on a show for the ghosts." Ah! So it's a Taoist rite. This reminds me of the group of people who looked like beggar ghosts who came to my house yesterday to ask for donations. Because their so-called righteous words gave me a headache, I gave them a "Zhongshan head" -- that's the price of my old man's sweat and blood! Who knew they would use it to put on this kind of show? Shanghai is really easy to "fall for"! I really don't understand, does putting on a show like this really give the dead ghosts blessings and "deliver" them? Really, in this day and age, people are not as good as ghosts. This old man still has to work like a horse all day long, and I've never heard of anyone wanting to give me any blessings or save me. Ghosts, on the other hand, have compassionate gentlemen with bodhisattva hearts willing to "deliver" them. Really, in this day and age, no one is going to "deliver" or "save" this group of us who are sweating and bleeding. All we hear and encounter are increased oppression and burdens. But ah, are we willing to accept this?</p>

<p>丨I am a person, I am even more a young girl丨</p>
<p>In such seemingly integrated combination, in such closely-related lives, no one would have thought that they were so different at heart, with such a vicious chasm dividing them, like a first wife wielding real power lording over a concubine, but here it is filled with the temptation of money, and no sour mockery.</p>
<p>Ah Ying, in the madam's mouth, is a particularly strange prostitute, and the most heartless. For example, during the January 28th Incident last year, when the madam was ill and unable to supervise her, she also pretended to be sick and didn't go out. Sometimes, she would spend the whole day and night saying she was going to the Suzhou Creek to see the excitement. When she was called out to do business at night, she would use the excuse of martial law, saying that there was simply no one walking on the streets. During the day, she would just loaf around all day, and it didn't matter if she didn't turn in any money. She would even get angry: "Do you think there's business to be done during the day? The airplanes are rattling in the sky so much, and the atmosphere is so tense, who has the leisure or the money?"</p>
<p>The madam hated her thoroughly. For an entire month, she only turned in forty yuan. When she was asked about it, she would immediately get angry.</p>
<p>The madam was grateful that "good fortune shone on her" and that she was finally free of her illness with the final cannon fire of the Japanese soldiers attacking Zhabei.</p>
<p>She went out, and acquaintances all complimented her: "Your Ah Ying seems to have changed recently. She's very generous!" Lao Si said it most vividly: One day, he saw her riding in a car on the street, and another day, he saw her with a young white face going to a certain big hotel. He also found out how she was enticing the young white face, making him cling to her, letting her manipulate him, playing "being kept" like a poodle.</p>
<p>When the madam heard this, she was horrified. She had never dreamed that little Ah Ying was involved in such a thing. Ah, no wonder she had completely changed. When she did business, she always said that she had been standing on the street all day, and she used the excuse of martial law at night to stay at home. It turned out she was being kept by a young white face outside.</p>
<p>"Ah Ying, you're so bold, daring to play tricks in front of me. Tell me truthfully, tell me truthfully about your loafing around this month!"</p>
<p>"Nothing, haven't I been reporting it every day! I made three yuan one day, and I didn't get any business another day." Ah Ying was a little frightened. She realized that as soon as the madam got better, she would be taking it out on them again, otherwise, where would the medical expenses come from?</p>
<p>Ah Ying was thinking to herself: Only the madam's lover, Hu Mazi, had introduced her to an old military officer named Zhao. He had a full beard and was so old, but he still pretended to be young. She reluctantly spent a night with him, and he still kept pestering her afterwards. But that time, she turned in the money according to the rules, it was just that she secretly pocketed the extra bit that Old Zhao gave her. Could that be it? Tell me truthfully, could that be it!</p>
<p>As for having some dealings with Young Wang, I'd need to have such abilities, and I am a young girl, and I spend my own money. Is it destined in our young girls' lives that we are only to be played with by dead men like Old Zhao? Absolutely not!</p>
<p>Sister and Miss</p>
<p>Ah Ying was pondering, not answering, and the madam hit her to the ground with a stick. Then many onlookers began to kick and punch her.</p>
<p>Ah Ying struggled to defend herself, shouting:</p>
<p>"I am a person! I am even more a young girl!"</p>
<h3 id="e267">Autumn Clouds - Preface by Qian <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>How can I not miss it, this day a year ago! At that time, summer had just passed, the intense heat replaced by the coolness of autumn. A gentle breeze of early autumn blew on people, causing an inexplicable comfort. Outside Fengrun Gate in the capital, with clear lake water on both sides and green mountains in the distance, a long embankment stretched out, planted with [space left blank in original]. The autumn cicadas were singing their sorrows above people's heads. However, neither she nor I felt any sense of solemnity. Our hearts were filled only with emotions as warm and fervent as those of a gentle spring.</p>
<p>At that moment, we were strolling on the long embankment, each silently enjoying the gifts of nature. Suddenly, a white cloud flew from the east, resembling an elephant with a long trunk, but after several rotations, it suddenly transformed into a divine dragon with bared teeth and claws. She looked up and couldn't help but sigh, "Autumn clouds are so ever-changing, seeing it now, I truly believe it!"</p>
<p>"You're about to become literary," I said with a smile. Suddenly, a sense of melancholy washed over my heart: "The changes of human affairs are probably even greater!"</p>
<p>My face changed from [space left blank in original] to [space left blank in original]. My heart seemed shrouded in a dark shadow, and the weight of that shadow seemed to grow heavier and heavier, so heavy that I couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>She seemed to sense something was amiss, but she didn't reveal it, because she knew that dwelling on things would only make the situation worse and would only be detrimental to me. So, she said with a faint smile:</p>
<p>"Your words are somewhat seemingly true but actually false. Among my many classmates, among my many relatives, although there are some who change very quickly, they are in the minority. Most of them are progressing smoothly... Moreover, in the attitude of a revolutionary youth, one should only grasp reality and not dwell on the future, especially not be pessimistic about the future. Yu! Be optimistic, our future is the brightest."</p>
<p>Her gentle attitude, her generous words, her fiery passion, made me feel excited, and the shadow in my heart disappeared without a trace. We walked hand in hand and stopped under a large willow tree.</p>
<p>"Is it okay to sit here?"</p>
<p>"Very good."</p>
<p>So, we took out a handkerchief, spread it on the ground, and sat down leaning against each other. The shade of the willow tree covered us, and a gust of wind blew from across the way, tousling her short hair. We talked, we laughed, we looked at the white clouds flying overhead for a while, we looked at the mountain scenery in the distance for a while, and we looked at the yachts in the lake for a while. At this time, we were almost completely intoxicated by nature.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a light and delicate voice came from behind us: "Sir, Miss, would you like to take a boat to play in the lake?"</p>
<p>When I turned around and saw clearly that it was a boat girl, I asked for her consent. She nodded in agreement, and we jumped onto the boat one after the other. The boat girl poked the punt pole against the shore, and the boat slowly moved towards the depths of the lotus pond. This poetic situation made people forget everything, and she couldn't help but sing softly. How deep that day's impression was on me! Now, driven by the whip of life, I have drifted to Shanghai. Everything feels noisy and turbid. As for her, because I haven't heard from her for a long time, I don't know what her situation is? The changes of human affairs are even greater than those of the autumn cicadas!</p>

<p>The [Shanghai] rickshaws, the [blank space in original] rickshaws, and the Changsha rickshaws are equally crowded. Walking on the streets, all I hear is the "He Nan! He Nan!" sound filling my ears. This is the sound of the rickshaw pullers [blank space in original] pedestrians [blank space in original]. What these words mean, I can't figure out. They are all very honest laborers squeezed out of the countryside, and their prices are very fair. They are living at a very low standard.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>There are no "bums" there, but there are "ruffians." There are often such noises in the streets and alleys: "Ruffian, I'll spit a mouthful of thick phlegm at you!" or "Son of a bitch, bastard!" They even escalate into full-blown fights, grappling in a ball. In the deep alleys at night, it is inevitable to "set a price point"! Just like the "pig butchers" of Shanghai, it's terrifying robbery.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>The most striking figures on the streets are students. Whether it's sunny or rainy, whether it's male or female, everyone has a fancy umbrella in their hand (a more advanced and elegant paper umbrella). This is the most distinctive mark of the students.</p>
<p>The boys wear twill student uniforms, and the girls wear foreign cloth blouses and skirts. There are no Western suits, and no "tuk, tuk" sounds of high heels. This simple dress has a kind of simple and elegant flavor, charm, and does not detract from the masculinity of the men or the beauty of the women.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>However, in recent years, their studies and thoughts have become increasingly strange, clumsy, and backward. Perhaps this is because "those who are near vermilion get stained red," due to their environment. For example, outside of class, they mostly read old antiques such as "Ancient Prose Style" and "Selections of Refined Literature." In class, they "read the classics" and "recite history." As a result, their thinking has stagnated, narrowed, and even become completely confused. The men only hope to rise rapidly in the world, get rich, and become officials, while the women mostly yearn for the inhuman enjoyment of being a concubine. At most, they just want to be a "virtuous wife and loving mother," dependent on men.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>In the evening, the sound of "ding-dang... ding... ding-dang" of the charter rickshaws echoes through the streets. Inside sit either vigorous young military officers or civil officials with bearded cheeks, or flower-decked girls and powdered mistresses. Behind the rickshaws, there are often guards with peeled-shell guns at their waists running alongside.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Although there are no dance halls, and the cinemas are also very shoddy, there are large-scale elevated stages and dance floors. It's just that the wealthiest people are most interested in [space left blank in original] becoming depraved. [space left blank in original]. X X X X X</p>
<p>Brother Qiu Ren has great power and is definitely not as unrespected as those in Shanghai. They often barge straight ahead on the streets, haggling hard when shopping. Grouped in threes and fives, they make people afraid to approach because they only know how to say "this" and "that," and don't reason at all.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>People there don't have much interest in sightseeing, because the natural environment is too monotonous. The gardens are desolate, and the unremarkable Tianxin Pavilion and Yuelu Mountain across the river are considered places to wander around. In fact, they all inevitably disappoint people after you visit them.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, in the quiet stillness, the sound of the night watchman's clapper, "bang, bang, bang," permeates the hawkers' cries of "white sugar lotus seed porridge ba," echoing in the deep alleys, which is most unbearable to listen to.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>What makes people most reminiscent of the past and the future is that, in recent years, the police power on the streets has often been replaced by soldiers with loaded guns and horse blades (sabers). Not to mention martial law during commemorative holidays, even normally, soldiers often stand guard on the streets for long periods, one every few feet, requiring them to stand with their legs apart and pedestrians being subject to inspection at any time, extremely revealing the terror of the times.</p>

<p>Some of my housemates are working at their desks, some are playing mahjong, some are playing the phonograph, and some are listening to the radio. In addition, the vendors in the alley are still raising their voices to sell their wares, so the quiet night is still disturbed by sounds, just like the waves of ether.</p>
<p>I hate being disturbed the most, so I hide alone in my small room. After finishing my diary, I take out the dried mud fish that my aunt brought from the countryside and chew on it. At that time, the lights in the room are off! I lie on the bed and chew it carefully. It really tastes delicious! After eating one, all that's left is the head! Ah! I am horrified, I dare not eat it anymore. Because this is the head of the dead! Am I really such a cruel carnivorous animal? So, I quickly and forcefully throw it out the window, right onto the tinplate of the workshop downstairs, making a loud bang. I feel even more chilled, realizing that the head I threw down was so big that it could have such a big reaction!</p>
<p>I begin to realize that this world is a carnivorous world! Yes, the law of the jungle has almost become an unchanging principle. Therefore, if we want to survive and not have our own flesh eaten, we must rise up and effectively resist the invasion of the strong. If we only know how to "be respectful" and "make concessions," then we are weak! We will ultimately be swallowed alive, caught, killed like dried mud fish, dried, chewed in the mouth, and finally discarded its useless head and bones!</p>

<p>Can He Be Ordered to Move Elsewhere?</p>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am a small clerk with shallow knowledge. Now, because of a very difficult matter at home that I cannot resolve, I specifically ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>My father had three brothers. Since my late grandparents passed away, they had already split up and established their own households, which was quite harmonious. Unfortunately, my second uncle passed away last year, leaving behind a wife and a daughter, who depend on each other for survival. Recently, my second aunt was seduced by a rogue and committed adultery, openly living together, and their feelings for each other are extremely strong. As a result, scandalous rumors spread everywhere. She even claimed that my father was the one who spread the rumors and constantly spoke to him with malice. The other day, because of a trivial matter, an argument broke out, and she even gathered a group of rogues, armed with weapons, to break into our house and destroy our furniture. My father resisted slightly, and in the chaos, her daughter's face was slightly injured, resulting in bleeding. At this point, the other party made a mountain out of a molehill. A person named Zhang, who is now a teacher at a school and has many connections with people in the court, instigated them to arrest my father for the crime of assault. Fortunately, thanks to the persuasion of others, he was spared litigation. But since then, the other party has become even more reckless, and it is truly unbearable to live with them. Now, I plan to order her to move elsewhere. I don't know if the law allows it. When moving, can we take away the ancestral inherited farmland? I hope you can provide detailed instructions on both matters. I am truly grateful. Special.</p>
