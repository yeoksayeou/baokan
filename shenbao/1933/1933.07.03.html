<p>日軍全部撤退無期</p>
<p>平東六縣民衆反對僞軍編警</p>
<p>（天津）　北寗路定三日晨九時開車赴唐山、第一列材料車、第二列交通車、（二日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　北寗通車問題、日方應許兩項、㈠將沿線日軍及僞軍撤至距離較遠地點、經過各站、不駐日兵、北寗路得派徒手警察押車通過日軍防地、由日憲兵登車彈壓、㈡每日開行往返客車兩列、第二步再展長開至秦島、因唐山以東日軍尙未撤退、北寗路局今已將試道車準備、由事務處長司梯理乘該車前往唐山如安全通過、四日起開駛第二次客車、各站鐵路行政權亦交還北寗路、（二日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）　北寗路交通車一列、及修理路線應用材料、已準備完妥、因需由日兵護車、何時開車、需候日軍部决定、據路訊、三日恐仍難開車、但恢復平唐列車、似無問題、中村擬聽大連會議最後消息、方始派兵保護交通車出發、（二日專電）</p>

<p>（北平）　接收戰區各縣、最早須旬日後方能開始、目前正交涉第一步恢復交通、與僞軍問題、如順利解决接收進行、或無窒礙、唐山以西日軍確已撤退、（二日電）</p>
<p>（北平）　關東軍方面日前召集師團長、在大連會議、並派小磯參謀長參與指導、討論長城線駐軍等問題、現會畢各師團長均已雖去、小磯仍留大連、指示關東軍代表及李春闞鐸等、與我方接收委員薛之珩·雷壽榮·殷桐·協議一切、約二三日可完竣、薛雷等談畢即返、參與第二次塘沽會議、我方戰區接收委會委員李擇一·劉石蓀·魏鑑·錢宗澤等均留津、協同于學忠隨時進行一切、陶尙銘因要公昨晚返平、（二日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　北寗路交通問題經錢宗澤與津日駐屯軍司令官中村交涉、預定明日起、先通車至唐山沿途暫請日憲兵負責保護、首次通車將先開警備車一列探道、視察沿路軌道橋梁、俾隨時修理、至客貨車列車通行、尙須稍緩一二日、（二日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　平東薊縣·寳抵·玉田·遵化·三河·平谷等六縣民衆、反對僞軍編警、聯名具呈軍政兩會、請收回成議、（二日電）</p>
<p>（天津）　日方態度又變、預定二日開交通車赴唐山、恐難實現、（一日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）　北寗路唐榆段被僞軍把持、致不能通車、外人已洞悉、係日人暗中操縱、深致不滿、上月美國兵赴秦皇島、在田莊被阻、已對日方嘖有煩言、最近駐津意軍、擬赴北戴河附近、施行夏季訓練、向中日兩方交涉開車運送、因此日方遂向路局表示、願援助恢復唐榆段列車、局長錢宗澤一日晨十時赴駐津日軍部訪晤中村、磋商開車具體辦法、密譚一小時、决定二日開交通車赴唐山、由日兵隨車保護、惟因主權關係、我方亦派路警二十名護車、此行列車不售票、僅有運輸處長斯梯魯率領機工人員、修理被破壞之路簽揚旗、然後即開行北平、唐山間客貨列車、第二步再恢復唐山至榆關間之列車、大約可與僞軍問題同時解决、（一日專電）　　（北平）　接收戰區委員會一日在津成立後、對接收程序已有詳細商决、陶尙銘等一部委員、一日晚返平向當局報告、但長城各綫日軍、何時可以撤竣、我方何時可以接收戰區、目下尙談不到、緣日方撤兵一節、只能照停戰協定所載、作一叚落、無全部撤退之可能、但如何撤退、如何接收、胥視大連會商之結果、始能確定、我方組織接收委員會、乃係事前一種凖備、聞薛之珩·殷同·雷壽榮等、一日晚已抵大連、日代喜多及李際春闞鐸等、均先期到連、一日晚已作第一次會晤、預定二日將接收戰品處置僞軍並北寗通車各問題、提出談判、期於會商後對前項問題作一具體方案、分别負責實行、日僞兩方均頗表示誠意、究竟能否得有圓滿結果、此時殊難預料、不過接收戰區及北寗通車兩事、其主要關鍵在於解决僞軍問題能否順利而定、蓋灤東各地僞軍、自始即由日方扶植而成、近且日益擴張、僞軍内部又極複雜、派别亦甚紛歧、然大權則操諸日方、是以均依日方之態度爲轉移、果爾日方負責恊助解决、僞軍自不得不俯首就範、僞軍問題如果解决、北寗交通自隨之進展、否則一切俱無實現可能、故大連之會實爲停戰談判後一重要會議、（二日中央社電）</p>

<h3 id="c60">世界經濟會議又一難關　明 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>世界經濟會議。自六月十二正式開幕以來迄今三週。其橫列於當前之最大難關。爲戰債問題。非特不能圓滿解决。抑且不敢公然提及。雖英首相致開會詞時。曾明白聲言。戰債不解决。世界經濟終難復蘇。然經美國表示拒絶以後。實亦無妥善辦法。英國對於到期戰債。爲欲保持其信用與留後日轉旋餘地。不得不支付一部分。但此已足引起歐洲各國之衝動。矧國家主義。又復盛行於時。現今理論上事實上縱已充分證明。國際合作如不成立。則世界經濟必難復興。普遍的經濟恐慌。亦無止境。然而舉世各國。莫不惑於自身之近利。不肯爲互利而有所犧牲。此主要問題。旣各懷異趣。而自戰債以下。所謂通貨問題·關稅問題·市塲開拓問題·等。又多「我執」之見。絶少協作之誠。此所以開會三週。而仍不能覓得一線合作之曙光也。</p>
<p>一般人意見。以爲此戰債問題。因抵觸過甚。暫置不談。而以其次之通貨安定問題。先謀解决。苟能求得一國際貨幣之穩定辦法。則國際貿易。或可到達。平衡狀態。經濟恐慌。或可稍减。頽廢之市塲。亦可藉以振興。固亦未始非計然而美國自金融恐慌發生以後。旣停止金本位。勢不能不採取通貨膨脹政策。以刺激物價。此種政策實施之結果。第一·使歐洲各金本位國。感受美國物品大量流入與現金流出之威脅。第二·美國國内市塲。將完全充滿其自國製造品。他國貨品。無從輸入。於是歐美對立。法美間之衝突。固無從調和。而他國亦不能釋然。蓋所謂通貨安定云者。非僅金本位與非金本位之競爭已也。即旣脫離金本位國。對於美國膨脹政策。亦焉能不懷戒懼哉。</p>
<p>法蘭西所領導之歐洲各國。在政治關係上。德國自另成一團體。但於經濟上仍不能與法脫離。荷·瑞等國。更無論焉。以吾人觀測。法國所以維持金本位制度之理由。第一·在保持其在歐洲金融界之絶對指導地位。蓋法國所存現金。逾三十二億美金。雖死藏於金庫之中。然已爲歐洲各國所重視。自美國抛棄金本位後。法在歐洲之地位。將益增高。第二·通貨平價。如果减低。則適與英國有利。而過度膨脹之後。法以較劣之工業。勢難制限外國製造品之大量輸入。故所謂安定通貨云者。即所以防止過度膨脹政策。亦即所以保持法國之優勢。</p>
<p>美國所以一反從前共和黨之所爲。而採用通貨膨脹政策。專從産業資本之利益着想者。蓋已讅知戰債之凍結。勢所必然。而在此産業頽廢農業衰退之際。僅憑金利支持。斷難維持其國内市場之繁榮。故目前應付政策。惟以通貨膨脹減低貨幣價値。提高物價。以圖恢復市面。此中意義。約有兩端。一則於刺激一般消費力之外。更鼓勵其對外輸出。再則美國製品。近以美金價値過高。在海外市塲。固不能與日本並駕齊驅。即較之英國。亦且落後。故不得不貶低其幣値。使美國貨品。重新躍登商品競爭之舞台。以轉換其經濟恐慌之頽勢也。</p>
<p>至英日兩國。早已放棄金本位。且其貨幣。現時又具有相對的穩定性。故於法美通貨安定之競爭。佯示中立。實則無論將來之趨向若何。彼等皆可以取得若干利益。總之「通貨安定」之原則。即令美國接受。亦决不肯盡量實施。况國際市場之價格。尤非會議席上形式之協定所能解决者耶。是故經濟會議。目前之難關。縱能渡過。而未來之厄連正多。樂觀成分。殊覺鮮少也。</p>

<p>赫爾今日說明美國政策</p>
<p>對歐原議主張再加修正</p>
<p>法代表團認有綏協希望</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美總統羅斯福已拒絶歐洲所提中央銀行合作穩定貨幣計劃、但仍留一再行談判餘地、聲稱、彼反對此計劃之現有方式、羅氏旣有此項聲明、加以美國務卿赫爾亦聲稱、將於星期一在經濟會議詳盡說明美國貨幣政策、已令一般人初聞拒絶時之失望爲之稍減、</p>
<p>美國務副卿摩萊爲準備美代表團聲明故、現將與歐洲主要各代表團領袖晤商、法財長龐萊已返巴黎、聞亦將於星期一回倫敦、聆聽美代表團之聲明、並參加目前形勢中可能的談判、</p>
<p>至美代表團聲明之性質、美國務卿赫爾尙未有表示、一般金本位國代表多信、美國將聲明、欲在國外貿易立塲上、獲得絶對的貨幣平等、因其他貶落幣値國家、獲得有價値之貿易利益、業已兩年、故非俟美國獲得同等利益後、美總統不欲參加嚴格之安定運動、但料赫爾亦將聲明贊同制止投機而起的暴漲暴落計劃、</p>
<p>法代表團雖保證金本位國將堅持原來提議、但亦信仍有妥協希望、法代表某聲稱、美總統之拒絶、不足驚異、惟若美國設堅持大加修改、則恐新計畫將絶少　益、因現有計畫、已極和緩之能事、當初金本位國之原提議、業徇英人要求、一再修改、渠不知此時尙有幾許可以修改也、</p>

<p>（倫敦）　出席世界經濟會議之主要代表、如法國之龐萊荷蘭之柯里恩等、多已返國、故今晨大會方面呈星期杪蕭索沉寂之氣象、用金國之代表今晨曾互相會商、但未聞商定切實辦法、各國代表似皆不願公然切實言及延會問題、蓋須俟星期一日美總代表赫爾發言後、始有動作也、有數方面謂華盛頓或有修正聯合宣言之建議云、今晨用金國方面之直接批評時局者、僅爲荷蘭銀行總裁特里浦博士、特氏在柯里恩返國時代理、荷蘭總代表職、據稱、羅斯福總統雖不贊成、然荷代表將繼續其金政策、不獨不放棄之、且將與其他用金國盡力合作、以維持之、用金國深知其政策擬防止貨幣紊亂、者之重要云、或詢以荷蘭是否凖備提議休會、特氏答稱、凡有理智之人、目前對於此事、不能表示意見云、中代表顔惠慶博士今日與路透訪員談話時、對於時局頗抱悲觀、謂據其意見、從中國立塲言、金問題至關重要、此問題苟不解决、則銀問題亦無從解决云、法國報紙以悲觀言論歡迎大會末日之將至、巴黎廻聲報謂經濟大會不復有存在之理由云、（二日路透社電）</p>

<p>在滬三十小時</p>
<p>行蹤極爲秘密</p>
<p>行政院長汪清衛於前午十二時半偕曾仲鳴乘中航公司飛機來滬請諾爾醫生醫治背癱旋於昨晚乘汽車至北站、乘夜快車晋京、同行者、有褚民誼·楊德昭·鄒琳·等數人、</p>
<p>汪氏此次來滬、行蹤極秘、本報記者、前日接京電、悉汪確偕曾仲鳴、乘坐飛機蒞滬、即晚至蒲石路汪宅探詢、汪宅家人否認此說、謂汪仍在京未來、繼至有關係各處、亦不得要領、迄未能證實汪氏抵滬之說、昨晨本報記者、復至汪寓詢問、據汪之秘書林汝衍談、汪偕曾次長確於昨日（一日）下午三時許乘飛機抵滬、即往諾爾醫院診治背癱、昨晚（一日）十一時、已由眞茹車站乘車返京矣云云、但詢之諾爾醫院、則謂汪始終未往診治、直至昨晚、曾仲鳴氏、突然通知路局、於下午十一時半、特别快車、加掛花車、屆時汪氏乘汽車蒞北站、即登車返京、其夫人陳璧君女士及鐵次曾仲鳴、均未同行、前日汪氏離京後、飛滬飛贛之說、莫衷一是、至此眞相始明、</p>

<p>暢談最近政局</p>
<p>中央社云、立法院院長孫科氏、前晚由京搭乘夜車來滬、昨晨八時許抵北站、當即返寓休息、中央社記者昨晨往訪孫氏於私邸、詢以海關進口新稅則等各項問題、當承詳爲答復如下、</p>
<h3 id="c106">關稅新則 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>據孫氏談、關於海關進口新稅則案、前經財政部擬定、提交行政院通過、再行呈請中央政治會議審核、中政會以此項稅則、關係重大、如一經洩漏、商人預知、何者將增稅幾許、即可先期訂購運華、避免增稅、流弊至大、是故决定一面先行公佈施行、一面再交立法院審查修改、一俟修改完竣、再行公佈、依照修正稅則施行、立法院現正着手審查、根據保獲關稅之原則、對於奢侈品之進口稅率增加、對於必需品如紙類等等、國内雖能製造、但求過於供、故依照原定稅率、不予增加、其他國内已能自製、不必仰給於國外之物、亦須略行增加、惟修改之處甚少、日内即可完竣、至於傾銷稅則、迄今尙未提交立法院審查、</p>

<p>旋談及新疆事件、孫氏謂、自黃專使到新、宣達中央意旨、安撫民心後、情勢已緩、各部省軍、已有團結、將馬仲英軍擊潰、政府現正研究善後之處置、關於政治方面、須改組省府、以期政治之革新、惟人選尙未决定、或由黃專使實授主席職、或另委他人、軍事方面、因省軍各部向不合作、故亦須改組、新變中、盛世才部、維持地方、最爲出力、故省軍改組後、或歸渠統率、中央并已調遣軍隊前往、共維治安、至東北抗日軍隊、退俄入新者、如馬蘇李等部隊、將如何處置、尙無具體辦法、上述問題、解决尙易、所感困難者、爲該省之金融、蓋該處並無銀行之設立、省府濫發紙幣、額至一萬五千萬兩、而市價則每紙幣一兩僅三分、總値約僅四百萬兩、故金融紊亂、財政困難、政府擬在該省設立中央銀行分行、以爲整理、此議亦在研究中、</p>

<p>孫氏繼談川省善後督辦向英借欵三千萬元之說、完全不確、蓋在此世界不景氣之現况下、此項鉅額借欵自不可能、而川省問題之解决、亦非僅借欵所能爲功、孫氏又發表渠對此事之意見云、省政之改革、在於各軍領袖之能和衷共濟、在消極方面、合力勦匪以解除人民痛苦、而减輕人民負担、積極方面、自在努力建設以恢復地方元氣、現在各軍計不出此、反以個人地盤相爭、而發生内閧、糜爛地方、騷擾人民、其害匪淺、益予共匪以滋擾之機會、故各領袖如不覺悟、則將無澄淸及改革省政之希望云、</p>

<p>實業部長陳公博以發展漁業、除開拓鹹水富源外、爲消弭海盜及國防之補助、爰本取之於漁用之於漁之原則、組織江浙漁業改進會、確定漁業建設費之徴收辦法、將徴收各費、由魚行代徴後、專欵存儲、擬隨時舉行江浙區内漁業重要地點氣象預報計劃、及添設巡艦、以保護漁業在海上之安全、</p>

<p>江浙漁　改進會自成立後、建設費徴收處、於四月十五日開始徴收、并以轄區遼闊、分爲十區辦理、其徴收漁獲物、分爲五種、㈠鮮魚類㈡鹹魚類、㈢乾魚類、㈣滷魚類、㈤海貝類、徴收標準、以百分之一爲比例、由各魚行代扣彙解、卒以徴收人員種種苛擾及需索、爲章則所未規定之零數、亦以整數計算、又以海貝等類、向爲舶來品、在進口時、已由海關正收關稅、該處又徴建設費、因是杭州齋山寗波石浦定海鎭海等各魚業團體、爲免除痛苦起見、紛紛起而反對組織江浙魚業聯合公司樹一幟、與改進會週旋於樽俎之間、</p>

<p>在雙方尙未解决之前、就本市魚行論、共計二十五家、繳費者衹五家、餘則停止繳費、故征收處所征收之建設費、爲數極微、各工作人員薪津、迄今將三月、並未發給、該處主任戴雍唐、由個人墊付辦公費、已達萬餘元、上次所允每月補助江浙漁業管理局經費洋二千元、亦未撥付分文、故截止現在、所有各費、已實行停止征收、故工作亦在停頓狀態中、</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第五章　醫藥之行政</p>
<p>第二節　醫藥界名稱與團體</p>
<p>除此之外就是學會了。現在有二大學會的總會所，都在上海，一個是中華醫學會，一個是中華民國醫藥學會，還有從前的博醫會，乃是敎會西人與華人所組織，現在已歸併入中華醫學會了。本來學會的性質與公會性質不同，前者是學術機關後者方是職業團體；但是事實上醫師公會未成立以前，醫界一切對外交涉，對内自治，全靠這兩個學會的團結，而且醫師公會含有各地方的單位性質，假如人數較少的地方，不能成立公會，却能享受學會總會的權利，所以學會也一向有醫政上的關係，依我看來，在最近的將來，必然有各醫學會大聯合的可能，内中一部份討論醫學，一部份研究醫政和業務。</p>
<p>新藥界方面最初簡直因爲中國向無藥學專科，故而沒有什麽名稱，自從有了藥學專門學校的畢業生，才漸漸有藥劑師三字。然而人數不多，亦並未立有單獨團體，所以藥界人材，大都皆係中華民國醫藥學會的會員，後來覺得潮流所趨，醫藥不能不分，所以大部份會員，自動組成了中華民國藥學會。學會之外，最近又成立了藥師公會，又有所謂新藥學會。内容不甚詳細。</p>
<p>藥房商方面，有一個新藥業公會，是當年黃楚九君所提倡，雖其時不能使各藥房都加入，却是一個很好的團結。在各藥房中還有一部份學徒出身的配藥師，當時因激於衛生署一種嚴格命令，自動組織了一個調劑師公會，却又與藥商藥學，兩不相干，其實可稱之謂必需的藥工。</p>
<p>舊醫方面，最先的團體呌神州醫藥學會，還是李平書先生在日號召成的，他曾當過會長，這會的性質，也是半學會半公會的色彩。如今最時髦的機關呌作國醫館，牠的口氣就大了。第一産生地帶是中央黨部，不是醫者自動組織的；第二有要人扶植，所以性質像研究院，又像舊醫學會的總會：又像大學院；最近又想攫取管理舊醫開業的權，那儼然又像内政部衛生署了。可惜那萬能的國醫館，與原有的舊醫團體，並不一氣呵成，以致萬能等於無能，也無所事事　　舊藥界本來沒有單獨學科，只有藥商，故沒有學術團結，只有商業上的公會，就是國藥舖與藥行老班們的同業公會，而店夥老司務（就是製藥師）雖沒有公會，却有工會。記得前年爲加薪問題，鬧過罷工，而藥舖也鬧過罷市咧。</p>
<h3 id="c197">寸口診脈的討論（三） <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>㈥素問尺内兩旁一節不能附會到寸口脈法上去</p>
<p>素問脈要精微論，有一節說道；「尺内兩旁，則季脅也，尺外以候腎，尺裏以候腹，中附上，左外以候肝，内以候鬲，右外以候胃，内以侯脾，上附上，右外以候肺，内以候胸中，左外以候心，内以候膻中，前以候前，後以候後，上竟上者，胸喉中事也，下竟下者，少腹腰股膝脛足中事也。」這一叚文字，似乎和寸口脈法相近。金元以後的醫家，復古的風氣非常濃厚，所以明朝的人們，都把素問一節文字，附僉到寸口脈法上去，以爲是黃帝岐伯以來相傳的嫡派。可是這一節文字，始終沒有人解釋得淸楚，旣說尺内兩旁，又說尺裏尺外，到底内外兩字作什麽解釋？王啓玄楊上善馬玄臺張隱菴等都說是脈的兩側，汪心糓李中梓張景岳薛生白等都說是每部的上半部下半部，醫宗金鑑駁斥他們的主張，說道；「脈象渾一，並不兩條，亦不兩截，」這句話固然駁得不錯。但是他自己的主張，以爲内外即是浮沈，却又錯了。他旣說脈象渾一，却不想到分做寸關尺三部，己經是變成三截了。若是淨沈可以各診一處，豈不是又變成兩層了麽？還講什麽脈象渾一，豈不是自相予盾麽？所以四川廖平以爲素問這節文字，左想不對，右想不對，於把尺字改做足字，說是全身的三部九候，不是寸口脈法的三部九候，廖氏的說，雖熱也不見得眞是素問的眞詮，但於此可見得素問這節文字，要想附僉到寸口三部九候的脈法上去，到底是講不通的。現在的舊醫們，却喜歡把這節文字來做寸口脈法的護身符，說是黃帝歧伯的正法，這種錯誤，是不把古書精細研究的緣古，還要請他們再關着門讀幾年書才對哩。</p>
<p>㈦藏府分部各人意見不同竟分不出誰是誰非</p>
<p>寸口分部候藏的脈法，有兩大宗，明朝以前，多依脈經的話，明朝以後，多附會素問的說，但是其中又有許多不同的見解？譬如儲泳袪疑說引褚澄尊生經的話，說是勇子右尺爲命門，右關爲脾右寸爲肺，左尺爲腎，左關爲肝，左寸爲心，女子左寸爲命門，左關爲脾，左尺爲肺，右寸爲腎，左關爲肝，右尺爲心，脈經說左屬腎，右爲子戶，名曰三焦。滑伯仁說左尺爲腎膀胱命門，右尺爲三焦心包絡，朱丹溪以左尺爲腎膀胱，右尺爲命門三焦；李仕材以左尺爲腎及膀胱，右尺爲腎及大腸；李梴以男命門在左，女子在右；徐春甫以左尺診小腸膀胱，右尺診大腸；喻嘉言以小腸當候於右尺，大腸當候於左尺；張景岳以左寸候心與心包絡，右寸候肺與贖中，左尺候腎膀胱大腸，右尺候腎三焦命門小腸；陳無擇以藏候外感，府候内傷，李東垣以左主外感，右主内傷，就以上所舉的諸家主張看起來，幾乎沒有一個人意見相同的。得是此非，甲論乙駁。究竟　那一個的話對呢？所以陳修園弄得沒有辦法，胡亂把素問，王升和，李瀕湖，和張景岳四家的話，並列起來，說是都有道理，只好兼用。諸君請想一想，眞理只有一個，那裏可以家學說兼容並蓄起來？做個模稜兩可，是非混雜的灰色態度呢？這種方術，是不是可以實在應用到診斷疾病上去，能夠認識得病的眞面目麽？眞是糊塗得可笑！</p>
<p>㈧脈的跳動舊醫們都說是氣</p>
<p>素問平人氣象論說道：「胃之大絡，名曰虚里，貫鬲絡肺，出於左乳下，其動應衣，脈宗氣也，」左乳下裏面的東西，就是心尖的部位，他的跳動，就是心的跳動，是一切動脈跳動的原動力，說是「脈之宗，」倒是對的，說是「氣，」那就錯了，說是「胃的大絡，」那就更錯了。大約古人認識脈的跳動，都說是氣，我可以把靈樞五十營籍的話，來做對證，他說道，「人一呼，脈再動，氣行三寸，一吸，脈亦再動，氣行三寸，呼吸定息，脈行六寸，······二百七十息，行十六丈二尺，······周身，水下二刻，······一萬三千五百息，氣行五十營於身，」這就是脈的跳動，古人誤認做氣的流行的證據。到了現在貴國醫們，還是把脈當做氣，即如李瀕湖，他已經曉得寸口的脈，不是藏府所居的位，但是他還把脈認做是藏府的氣，别的醫生他也都這樣見解，豈不是大錯特錯麽？</p>

<p>於祁寒盛署之際，而舉行畢業考試固已有碍於兒童之健康矣惟事格成規，難於變易，且考試之時，儘屬一校，學生人數，尙不過多，猶可說也，今聚區域之學校，胥擠之於一堂之中，空氣惡劣，屋宇湫隘，固不待言，加以學生之中，并非完全健康者，有疾病未愈者，有疾病雖愈而尙未復原者，亦有有傳染性之疾病尙未過傳染期者，（如白喉腥紅熱等）咸以會考之故，不能不來，而病菌傳染，乃有一觸即發之勢，人愈多則傳染愈衆，其爲危險，寗可量耶？此其一。</p>
<p>二曰往返之勞苦也</p>
<p>會考云者，彙各校之學生集中於一地之謂也，夫旣有所集中，則學生與考場之距離，斯有遠近之别，近者固無論矣，遠者則奔走於炎風烈日之下豈未成年之中小學生所能任耶？且考試時期，非一日也；一日所考，非一次也，道途往返，已足勞形，至於飲食，則更無從計及矣！此其二。</p>
<p>三曰學校之開快車也</p>
<p>素主放任之學校，一旦猝聞會考之令，必至手足無措，藏拙無方，學校當局旣欲顧全學校之名譽，則學生之痛苦，自難兼顧，不得已而思其次，惟有加緊課程大開其快車而不止，而不問學生之能否容納也。夫以平曰素受放任敎育之學生，而一旦施以强迫之手段，好勝者則廢寢忘食，怯懦者則因畏生怠，自會考明令頒行以來，中小學學生之因用功過甚，而染神經衰弱症者，日甚一日，此其三。</p>
<p>以上所言其大略而已，其他不關於健康，如敎師之私竊考題與學生也，學生之當塲作弊也，範圍愈大弊　愈多。　　以健康爲敎育之中心，非本市敎育當局之在昭告於吾人者乎？惟一方則高談兒童健康以期健康敎育之實現，一方</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>則於政府摧殘兒童健康之會考制度，奉行之又惟恐其不至也，南其轅而北其轍之矛盾，又寗過於此耶？是故吾不奇夫此種政令之頒行，而奇於頒行之時，正舉世提倡健康敎育之日，中央之衛生當局漢然無異議也，吾不奇夫此種政令之能通行，而奇於首先奉行之地，正以健康爲敎育中心之上海市敎育局，而本市衛生當局亦無異議也，余故略紓所見，以備關心本問題者採覽焉！</p>

<p>（十九）産褥中的攝生</p>
<p>（甲）衛生的必要</p>
<p>分娩畢後，安逸無事，應當靜心休養，無論如何，總須以衛生爲前提，六個星期的産褥期，需要相當之攝生，實較十月懷胎，來得重要。</p>
<p>産褥期中，如不攝生，往往惹起不幸的結果，最易斷送一生的幸福。例如：産褥熱子宮後屈症不妊症子宮内膜炎喇叭管炎等疾患，大都是由於不衛生而來，尤其是産褥熱一症·非常容易發生。</p>
<p>（乙）身體的淸潔</p>
<p>産褥中盜汗分泌，亂汁流溢；腋下染汚·惡露排洩·因此全身不潔，除在可能範圍，先行局部的洗滌外頭須俟四星期後：方可入浴，以求整個的淸潔。　　衣服衣衾，務須寬博淸潔，布墊床褥等，亦宜輕柔溫煖，並應時時替換洗滌，室内光線充足，空氣流通，須防止日光的直射，通風的直達，又如惡露的汚穢，便器的收拾，家具的整理，四隅的掃除，都應極力保持淸潔。</p>
<p>（丙）大便和小便</p>
<p>産後往往容易便秘，這是因爲腸蠕動的機能緩慢，與腸腔的内壓下降的緣故，産後三日便秘，雖無大碍，但便秘過久，有害心身，應用缓和的通便法，可先用溫水皂水甘油等灌腸。若仍無效，再投瀉鹽硫酸暫達蓖麻油等緩下劑，但不可用大黃，因有移行乳汁之弊。</p>
<p>産後小便，大抵亦多困難，膀胱充盈過度，有碍子宮的收縮，所以小便不宜久積，假使六小時内，並不小便，可用溫熱濕布，貼在膀胱部位。或在膀胱部位，施行按摩壓迫，或用消毒冷水　水，灌注尿道口，以便促進尿意。若仍無效，再用導尿管，施行導尿，但一切消毒，當比平時尤應嚴密，否則惡露竄入膀胱，那就受害不淺了！</p>

<p>（九）霍亂（吐瀉疫）</p>
<p>問　小腿股肉痙搐，用什麽方法處置？答　可用溫濕布菴包，或𠹭囉仿油塗擦。也有用酒精塗擦的。</p>
<p>問　霍亂的預防法怎樣？</p>
<p>答　把病人，和疑似病人，帶菌人隔離起來，所有一切病人的用具和排泄物，都要消毒。注意不吃路上賣的飲食物，驅除蒼蠅，謹愼飲食，以免傷害胃腸。注射霍亂預防菌苗。問　所謂防疫針就是什麽，怎樣注射？答　就是霍亂菌苗，在夏初就應當注射接種。大槪分三次注射：第一次注射五萬萬個死菌，第二三次都注射十萬萬個。每隔一星期注射一次。使身體内生出抵抗病菌的能力。但現在普通注射的，是霍亂和傷寒的混合菌苗，也是分三次注射的。第一次注射半立糎（十萬萬個霍亂死菌和二萬五千萬個傷寒死菌），第二次注射一立糎。</p>
<p>（十）腸熱症（傷寒症）（上）</p>
<p>問　腸熱症怎樣起的？</p>
<p>答　腸熱症，就是傷塞症。是因爲吃了不潔的附有傷寒病原細菌的食物而起的。</p>
<p>問　腸熱症的西文名稱是什麽？</p>
<p>答　英文名Ｔｙｐｂｏｉｄ　ｆｏｖｅｒ·德文名Ｕｎｔｏｒｌｅｉｄｔｙｐｈｕｓ拉丁文是Ｔｙｐｈｕｓ　Ａｂｄｏｍｉｎａｌｉｓ。</p>
<p>問　這種病原細菌，是誰發見的？形態怎樣？</p>
<p>答　是Ｅｂｅｒｔｈ和Ｇａｆｆｋｙ兩氏發見的。形態是一種桿狀菌，長短約等於紅血球的直徑的三分之一，菌端有鞭毛，能運動。</p>
<p>問　病原細菌到了腸内，在什麽部分，起什麽變化？</p>
<p>答　是在小腸内占居繁殖，起初腸管充血腫脹，後來壞死而起腐痂，最後腐痂脫落成潰瘍，終至結成瘢痕而治愈。</p>
<p>問　腸熱症的病，原菌傳染之後，隔幾天發病。</p>
<p>答　傳染後要經過一星期到三星期的潛伏期，纔得發病。</p>
<p>問　發病的起初怎樣？</p>
<p>答　先起前驅症狀，就是全身健怠。食慾不振，和四肢痛。身上覺得惡寒，然後發熱。</p>
<p>問　此後經過怎樣？</p>
<p>答　腸熱症的全經過，可以分做四期，就是：初期，極期，弛張期，和緩解期。各期都有一星期之久，共計四星期。</p>
<p>問　初期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　這時候的病狀，比上述的著明，發熱逐日上昇，像梯級狀，朝降夕昇，但每晨和每夕，平均比上一日的高半度或一度。到第五日至七日達最高度。舌乾燥，被厚苔，脈搏是重複性，見便秘或泄瀉。此外因爲脾臟腫脹而訴左季肋部有疼痛，胸腹部皮膚面有薔藢疹的紅點發現。問　極期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　到極期的時候，全身症狀增進，體温稽留於攝氏表三十九度或四十度的高熱，早晨和晚間，相差不到一度。（稱做稽留熱）脈搏頻數，但並不跟發熱平行。此外腹部膨滿，（鼓腸），迴盲部有雷鳴，並且有壓病，脾腫著明。面容，呈無慾狀；陷於嗜眠昏睡，時發誕語。往往有咳嗽。</p>
<p>問　弛張期的症狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　熱度開始現一高一低的弛張狀態。其程度逐漸著明。到這一期的終末，薔藢疹完全消失，出現汗疹（俗稱白瘖），舌苔剝離稍微有些食思。在重症病人，合併心臟衰弱，最危險的尤其是腸出血，腸穿孔，或卡他兒性肺炎。</p>
<p>問　這些合併症，是不是要致命的？</p>
<p>答　是的。腸熱症病人的死亡，大都在這時期的幾種合併症。</p>
<p>問　緩解期的病狀怎麽樣？</p>
<p>答　這一期的熱度，弛張狀態更是著明，朝夕相差竟達二度以上，最後成爲間歇性，成爲渙散狀下降，脾腫和鼓腸消失，就入恢復期。（未完）</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>㈡鼓脹　　一提到鼓脹，不覺就連想我們所稱的腹水，我覺得幾乎完全可拿來代表的。他的原因，大槪不外於下述三種：㈠爲心臟病肺部血液循環障礙局部症象之一；㈡腎臟炎浮腫症狀之結果；㈢由於門脈血行障礙，致液體蓄於腹腔内，這一類大都是肝部諸病。萎縮性肝硬變肝梅毒二者是最顯著的例。此外像腹膜諸病也有時發生，結核性腹膜炎是一個好例；婦女的卵巢水腫，和腹水有時是不易濫别的，那當然也包括在鼓脹裏面了丨一般人又認爲鼓脹有水鼓氣鼓二種：第一種當係指腹水；第二種則凡腹内積有氣體，致腹部膨脹都是。這類的例舉出來是很多的，像結核性腹膜炎在滲出液凝固成結締組織時，就很類似，小孩患腸寄生蟲症時亦有此症象。</p>
<p>根據上面所述的，那一般人所公認的鼓脹病，在我們新醫方面可能的；有萎縮性肝硬變肝梅毒卵巢水腫心臟病腎臟炎結核性腹膜炎等諸症。關於每一種病的特殊症象，現在且每種分述於下面：</p>
<p>㈠萎縮性肝硬變　本症初現消化障礙，胃部感覺壓迫，腹部時感澎漲，厥後面色徴現灰白，眼部輕度黃疸，肝部初現腫大，後漸縮小，脾狀腫大。其主徴爲腹水及腹部靜脈瘤狀擴張，二者爲此症診斷所憑藉。本症大抵由於慢性酒精中毒而發生，但由於急性傳染病後者殊不少。治療除禁忌酒類等刺激品物外，如有梅毒或瘧症原因，可用原症特效療法。利尿劑最需要，以水銀劑注射爲有效，但如繼續注射而腹水未輕減時，可用穿刺手術放出。但放出後極易復脹，須繼續多次方有效。本症預後不佳，至症象完全顯著時，（腹水發見）大抵爲期不過二三年。時因大吐血而危及生命。與胃潰瘍症相似。</p>
<p>㈡肝梅毒　本症屬梅毒第三期症象之一。在肝部發生橡皮性腫塊，大至粟粒至胡桃，白色或赤灰白色，大抵在肝表面，門脈處間亦有之。症象與萎縮性肝硬變相彷彿，大抵無自覺症狀，腹水，脾臟腫大，肝臟腫大最顯著，與肥大性肝硬變同。惟時發胆石性劇痛，帶弛張性熱型，間亦有發黃疸者。本症經過屬慢性，預後不良，治療除梅毫特效療注外，其對症療法與前同。</p>
<p>㈢卵巢水腫　婦女病之一。其腹部外表情形幾與腹水無異，亦無特殊自覺症狀。其鑑别須行腹部試騐穿刺手術，檢查其液體而定。尋常腹水之液體大抵透明，内含有白血球紅血球，蛋白定量不多，比重亦在ＩｏＩ２下；本症液體則較暗黑，帶粘性，内含有圓柱上皮顫毛上皮，時帶漿液體，蛋白量可至５％，比重亦可至Ｉｏ２ｏ上。治療行割治手術可愈。惟帶漿液體者預後較不良。</p>
<p>㈣心臟性水腫　慢性心内膜炎因鬱血而起血液滲漏，集積於組織内，遂起浮腫；初見於足部陰囊，後呈腹水及皮膚水種。在心囊水腫一症中亦見之。患者呼吸困難，不能仰臥，尿量減少，時現蛋白。治療除毛地黃諸劑外，利尿劑助力甚大，水銀劑亦可用；帶梅毒性者可注射碘鉍等劑。本症腹水及皮膚水腫之輕減或排除，有時並不難。惟心臟本病則難全愈。由梅毒而發生者預後較佳。</p>
<p>㈤腎臟炎　本症大抵發生於急性傳染病猩紅熱傷寒等症後。主　爲尿量減少，最少每日衹二百立方生的米突（２ｏｏＣＣ），尿色暗褐，混濁不淸，内含多量蛋白，紅血球，白血球，腎上皮組織，以及各種圓柱狀物體。時有溫度增高及腎部壓痛自覺症象。其浮腫初現於眼部，後漸及於二足，由此而陰囊，最後則腹水胸水，以及全身；與心臟性水腫初現於兩足者不同。其經過大抵不外全愈，成慢性腎臟炎，及由尿毒症而死亡三途。治療首須禁忌食鹽，飲料亦須限制·食物在浮腫未退時以單服牛乳爲最佳，每日可至二立特。藥物以尿道防腐劑（Ｕｒｏｔｒｏｐｉｕ等）最宜，毛地黃等劑助力亦大，利尿劑須愼用，水銀劑注射須禁止，（刺激腎臟腸部過度）發汗劑及電光浴於退腫最宜。本症如未成慢性病者，在治療期之食物能如醫師指示實行·則大抵可全愈。</p>
<p>㈥結核性腹膜炎　本症係由結核菌侵入腹膜而致。患者以小兒少年爲多，其變化或爲粟粒結核，或成塊狀，或爲腹水性。其腹水液體暗褐，爲漿液纎維素性，有時帶出血或出血化膿性，比重常在Ｉｏｏ５以上，蛋白量亦多，與肝部病較異。其主徴爲腹部膨滿，腹壁硬固，腹部壓痛。間發不甚高之熱度。食慾不佳。本症經過自數月至數年，預後較其他結核症爲良，間有完全治愈者。如診斷有困難時，可行腹膜穿手術。治療除尋常結核症並通治療外外·用Ｓａｐｏ　Ｋａｌｌｎｕｓ　塗擦，太陽燈時亦有效。本症腸管與腹壁愈着，行穿刺手術宜愼，外科手術袛適宜於滲出性一種，但腸肺二部有結核症或有熱度均不宜。</p>
<p>除去上面所舉的諸症外，象水腫性和急性惡液性脚氣病，在浮腫漸蔓延全身的時候，一般人也當作鼓脹症的。甚至小兒患腸寄生虫病，有時腹部膨脹，也被误認。但這二者醫家診視不難鑑别，可能性也較少，所以此處也不再三曉曉了！</p>
<p>現在可以答覆鼓脹病預後良否這一問題了！就上面所舉數症而論，萎縮性肝硬變希望最少，肝格毒次之，另外的諸症都是很有希望的。治愈的例也很多。我們就拿心内膜炎一症來說，關於心瓣閉鎖不全和狹窄不能治愈是無可諱言的；但對於全身浮腫現象是很可以除去的。自覺症狀有時也可毫無的。就是對復發一層·衹須病者攝生得當，也很有希望。這完全在病者自身有深切了解與否罷了！對於腹水用穿刺手術放出一事，許多人因爲放後復脹，非常不滿意；這手術之非特效方治，我們也未嘗有所諱，但在今日比較排除腹水之唯一穩孚辦法，對於門脈血行障礙也是一强有力的抵抗。假使繼續多次，也未嘗無一線之希望。這一點我希望讀這篇文的人，都應該深刻了解纔好。（未完）</p>

<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>各地會考，有起初反對的，有臨時洩漏考題，發生風潮的。推原其故，都由於未得考之道。</p>
<p>考亦多道矣，一言蔽之，取法乎古而已。考是一種古法，考的本義也是法古。請試考之。說文：「考，老也」。這是轉注，所以又說：「老，考也」。「考」解作「老」，而「老」又解作「考」，依然是他的他，這須得另想别法了。老者，墨守老法之謂也。這是我的假借，墨守老法，義即取法乎古。這種訓詁，後生小子許要說我穿鑿附會。但在老師宿儒看來，却定要喟然而嘆曰：「闡精發微，馬鄭再生。許愼知己，吾道不孤」。我不是在自誇，確是有把握的，因爲老師，宿儒，法古，三位而實一體。</p>
<p>閒話少說，言歸正經。考的古法是什麽呢？曰刑曰賞而已。二者合之兩美，離之俱傷，須要相提並重。知識分子，不論古今，無分上下，都可徠之以賞，威之以刑的。威以刑，則知識分子知所戒：徠以賞，則知識分子知所勉。戒與勉的心理，起了化合作用，則受考者對於考者，自然猶水就下而沛然莫之能禦了。如僅拿畢業不畢業做標準，則畢業不是賞，畢業的沒有賞，不畢業非即是刑·不畢業的不加以刑，於是在彼旣無駡馭的憑藉，在此也無覊縻的關係了。因有從前一樣的考，一樣的有畢業不畢業：何分這樣的考，那樣的考？</p>
<p>遺老常說，民國以來的考，僅是具有考的糟粕，考的精義已喪失盡凈了。「時疫」的救治，還須用「古方」。</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>福福跑得滿頭油汗，氣憤憤地回來了。他一蹲身坐下，脫去卸在半背的白布短衫，向板凳上一摜，皺緊眉頭，仰着脖子出神。</p>
<p>「你老是這副神氣，到底菩薩說些什麽呀？」福福媽這麽說着，也蹲下身來，把手搖着福福的肩胛，撅起瘪了兩頰的嘴唇，睜圓了凹陷的眼睛，等候他的滿意答復。然而她突突地跳動着的胸間，已經有幾分明白，「籤詩」一定凶多吉少，不然，福福斷不會像那麽生氣似的。　　一會兒之後，福福丢了香烟頭，重重地歎口氣。</p>
<p>「不行！蝗蟲要開口的！」</p>
<p>「誰說？」</p>
<p>「菩薩的「籤詩」是這麽說呀！」</p>
<p>福福媽臉色突然變白，兩手搥着大腿，眼淚像珠絡似的直流下來；跟着，喉　一陣抽噎，便「苦命的福福爺呀！丨丨」大哭。福福把指頭畫着泥地，不作聲。</p>
<p>這時候外邊田塲上忽然起了喧嚷，福福媽自動地止了哭，撩起衣角擦着眼皮出去，瞥見東北那邊空際的蝗蟲，漫天蔽地飛來。福福媽立刻跪倒，一連磕了幾十個響頭；直到蝗蟲的大隊飛過，才抖着脚脛起來，嘴裏咕嚕咕嚕地祝禱：猛將菩薩有靈感，不要放神兵喫我的田稻，今年秋收上塲，可以多糶幾塊錢。她同時又記起四年前的蝗蟲，也是去而復來，終於把周圍二三百畝田稻喫光；便是從那年起，家境就逐漸困難，而且開始賣田，負債和當當。現在一總只剩了八九畝田，如果再遭一次蝗災，那麽，簡直只有一條死路；福福爺到冬的安葬，福福的親事丨丨這些急於解决的大事，自然越發不能舉辦！丨丨</p>
<p>她這樣呆呆地想着，眼圈兒一紅，幾乎又迸出淚來。福福在堂屋裏點起香燭，恭而且敬地磕頭，作揖。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，五天，蝗蟲雖然一羣羣的飛來，却沒有開口，福福媽和福福的臉上，都浮了些答紋；一切未來的恐怖幻想，貤減退不少。後村祠堂裏訓蒙的王先生說，昨夜猛將菩薩降乩，「神兵」已經渡江而北，决不在江南「採糧」了。於是福福媽聽到王先生斬鋼嚼鐵的話語，似乎心裏放下一塊石頭；全村的鄰居，也都顯</p>
<p>出有恃無恐的神情。</p>
<p>嚓嚓嚓！丨丨丨</p>
<p>第六天的中年，「神兵」突然實行「採糧」了。牠們的陣線，在幾分鐘之間，延長到二十多里。福福媽直挺挺地跪在田塲上，臉孔像死人一樣。福福赤着膊跑出去，又跑回來，發瘋似的嚷道：</p>

<p>— 徐煒</p>
<p>車廂裏，只是一片喧嘩的，糊塗的，沸騰也似的混亂的聲音。</p>
<p>我用着　奇的目光，從這邊偷溜到那邊的盡頭，再從那邊的盡頭偷溜到這里，我看到，在這種暖烘烘的空氣裏，貯滿了無數的繁雜的人頭：長的方的，圓的，扁的，胖的，瘦的：每個都好像失却了靈魂似的亂動，妄搖，就跟秋天裏的麥穗給柔順的微風吹拂着而起的不平的浪波一樣。</p>
<p>一陣陣的頭的潮，喧動的連續着一陣陣的頭的潮，簡直使我昏迷了。</p>
<p>但當我纔垂下眼皮的時候，一種尖銳，咳嗽的聲音喚醒了我；我便用着惶恐的目光去注視，只聽「拍」的一聲，一塊又厚又綠的膠水似的痰，從一只黑迷迷的裏邊排挿着一列黃金色的牙齒的嘴裏，跳在這車廂的地板上。地板似乎駭怕一般的打了一個寒噤。</p>
<p>我望着這碧綠的痰發呆了。但正當我注視得發呆的時候，我又瞧見一只破舊的。滿塗着灰鏖的鞋子，阻住了我的視線，好像要滅亡這痰似的蓋了上來。丨半晌，又拖了過去。痰於是變做一塊廣闊的，單薄的白沫。</p>
<p>這白沬帶着一種可怕的笑臉，靜靜地望著扡方才竄出來的那只黑迷迷的嘴。這時兒。這黑迷迷的嘴似乎在報答牠的笑似的慢慢的也張大了，但隨後又有只骯髒的手，拏着支雪白的烟捲，沒氣息的挿在那個黑迷迷的嘴唇裏。於是：一陣烟！我不能再瞧見對面的形影了；我袛知道一陣陣不怕羞的烟圈把我連頭帶臉地包圍住，直到在汽笛的呐喊聲中我憑着自個兒的力量，掙得一點兒空隙跌出來的時候。</p>
<p>啊！這使我永不忘懷的，東方的古國，車廂裏的雖然是些小的形影哪！</p>

<p>— ｊｕｌｅｓ　Ｒｅｎａｒｄ作林取譯</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚的照片册　（續）</p>
<p>二十五</p>
<p>在外面的時候，爲的要證明他一切都不在乎，紅蘿蔔鬚便吹着口哨。可是一見到追隨在身後的雷辟克家的，他的呌聲便突然中止。這猶如把他的一個小小的不値錢的啣在嘴裏的呌子弄斷了般的使他難過。</p>
<p>可是我們得承認等到他剛剛開始抽噎時，她便放下不管了。二十六</p>
<p>他做了父親和母親間的連絡線。雷辟克對他說：</p>
<p>「紅蘿蔔鬚，這件襯衫上少了一個扣鈕。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把襯衫拿給雷辟克家的，也說道：</p>
<p>「難道我還用着你來命令嗎，小丑？」</p>
<p>可是她拿出針錢籃，把扣子縫上。</p>
<p>二十七</p>
<p>「如果沒有你父親在這裏的話，」雷辟克家的呌說，「你老早就對我下着辣手了，你已把這刀子挿入我的心裏，把我弄翻在稻草上面了。」</p>
<p>二十八</p>
<p>「把你的鼻子揩一揩啦，」雷辟克家的時時說。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚不倦地用手巾的邊揩着。如果手巾散了，他又把它折好。</p>
<p>確實的，當他傷風的時候，雷辟克家的給他塗着藥物，把他弄得髒汚不堪，竟至使姐姐愛勒絲丁和大哥菲利克斯都眼紅起來。可是她特意給他補說道；</p>
<p>「這與其說是一種毛病，不如說是一種好處。這可以使得頭腦淸爽起來。」</p>
<p>二十九</p>
<p>因爲雷辟克從今天早上起，便一直和他開玩笑，紅蘿蔔鬚不覺說出了一句這樣厲害的話：「讓我安靜點罷，蠢東西！」</p>
<p>說過之後，他馬上覺得四圍的空氣都凝凍了，他的兩眼裏有兩股灼熱的泉水。他喃喃着，衹要雷辟克做個手勢，他便會竄到地下去。</p>
<p>可是雷辟克許久許久地瞧着他，却沒有做那個手勢三十</p>
<p>姐姐愛勒絲丁馬上就要結婚了。雷辟克家的允許他在紅蘿蔔鬚的監視之下，和她的未婚夫�</p>
<p>散步。</p>
<p>「走在前面罷，」她說，「你儘管跳着頑好了！」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚走在他倆前面，他勉力跳着，徬徨着，如果他忘記把脚步放慢時，他便免不了要聽到一些飄忽的吻聲。</p>
<p>他咳嗽着。</p>
<p>這事使他感受刺激，突然，他在村裏的十字架像前，把帽子脫下丢在地上，用脚蹂躪着呌說道：</p>
<p>「難道永遠沒有一個人愛我嗎！」</p>
<p>卽刻，耳朶並沒有聾的雷辟克家的從牆後把身子伸出來，嘴上浮着可怕的微笑。</p>
<p>於是紅蘿蔔鬚慌張地補說道：</p>
<p>「除掉媽媽。」（全稿完）</p>

<p>自從敎部下了一道學校應採用二部制和半日制的命令之後、各市縣都準備在下學期要試行一下、</p>

<p>㈡流動班級的敎師、以兩班三敎師爲原則、輪流更替休息、自兒童入學至散學、常有一人陪同他們作息、</p>
<p>㈢兒童作息時間和課程等同普通學級一律、</p>
<p>㈣經費除敎員薪給外、以不支辦公費爲原則、</p>
<p>㈤每個兒童、應備一個硬木匣、在平時可以儲藏一切應用書物、在沒有座位時便當做矮凳、</p>
<p>（二）鄉村裏的流動學校</p>
<p>㈠用不到固定的校舍、就利用兒童家庭裏的客堂等空屋和地方上的祠廟等場合、當作臨時的敎學場所、最好是由兒童家庭方面輪流招留、並多多實施野外敎學、</p>
<p>㈡家庭能擔任輪流招留的、免除其子女的學費、㈢學費的收入、卽以置備必需的校具、除敎員薪給外、以不支辦公費爲原則、</p>
<p>㈣沒有定時的假期、在農忙時、敎師應巡迥指導兒童、助理父母操作、</p>
<p>㈤敎師因爲接近家庭、可以很自然地負起民衆敎育的責任來、中國民間最通行的圖書、倒是一本皇歷、指導成人識字、大可以從皇歷上出發、</p>

<h3 id="c246">血與金錢 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>血是人身最寳貴的東西；倘然沒有血，就要憔悴而死。「金錢」也是人生最寳貴的東西；倘然沒有金錢，就要窮餓而死。其實也可說金錢卽是血，血即是金錢。窮人以汗血換金錢，這是一個例子。還有白相人有幾句術語：錢多，呌做「血旺。」敲你竹槓，要你拿出錢來，呌做「出血。」囊中空空如，呌做「乾血癆。」這也是以血代表金錢的明證。</p>
<p>現在科　昌明，「血與金錢，」更加了一層密切的關係。富人少了血，害着病，可以出錢請醫生輪血。把甲的血，灌輪到乙的血絡裏，就會恢復健康。歐美各國，有等强壯的窮人，往往向醫院中請售自己的血。這樣一來，窮人的血，可以換取富人的金錢。富人的金錢，可以換取窮人的血。有了錢，不怕沒有血。前幾天，報紙上載着「段芝泉輪血健康」的新聞；他輪的血，　不過是子姪輩的血。我看此風漸開，一般富人如體質虚弱。患了貧血症。都可以轉危爲安，延年益壽，這眞富人的造化咧。</p>
<p>在下還有個計劃；在繁盛的都市裏，大可以開設一家眞正道地的人血公司，聘請醫師管理騐血輪血等手續。收羅窮人的血，用科學方法保存。標價出售，以便輪入富人的貴體中。不管窮人瘦，只要富人肥。定卜生意興隆，門庭如市。因爲富人的性命最要緊，有了血，就不怕閻羅老子下請帖。賣買人血，互相爲用。這倒是文明世界中，新發明的「生財之道」呢！</p>
<h3 id="c247">略論大便名稱之種種 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 李鵬翔</p>
<p>大便爲人人天天所不免之事。事雖簡單，但名稱却五花八門。每一名稱，能代表每一階級，現在把我所知道的來略論一下，間有考證，惟不敢存「蓋罩」胡適之先生「廬山遊記」中一番考證工夫之心耳。</p>
<p>洗手　在這類名稱之中，這可以算得最雅致的一個。外國人不言「大便」，而曰「洗手」，英文名爲Ｗａｓｈ　Ｈａｎｄｓ。一般「高等華人」多用之，示文明也。</p>
<p>大解　在平時，這是不常被人呼用的，除去中外醫生在醫治病人的時候。譬如問：「大解通否？」「吃了這幾粒（或幾貼）藥，大解或者可通」等。大解的姊妹稱呼便是小解，解者，除去也。</p>
<p>登坑　考此名起源於北方，而流傳於江南之地。北平一帶，即使在家庭裏，像我們這裏的「馬桶」是一槪不用的，以爲不合衛生也。到處皆是的便是毛厠。這毛厠，所謂「坑」不能坐而用，袛能「登」（或蹲）而「便」：此名稱之所由來。「中等華人」多喜喚之。</p>
<p>出恭　在一般指甲養得長長的前淸文士中·此「出恭」所佔的勢力很大。惟不知此「恭」字有誤否。不過讀陳望道先生所著「修辭學發凡」一書，内有「倒反」辭格一條。其定義爲：說者口頭的意思和心裏的意思完全相反的，名呌「倒反」辭。那末此所謂「恭」者，實者是心裏以爲的「不恭」也。這也可以說得通。</p>
<p>又郁達夫先生所稱「日記九種」第四頁内，有「天氣很睛爽，出去出恭的時候······」的話。多方考證，覺大致無訛，姑誌之，以質當世賢達。</p>
<p>最未便是來一個最粗俗，最下流的「出汚」了。一般「目不識了」的低等華人　」多喜說「我去出汚。」和「你出汚去嗎？一同去。」等等惡辭，「高等華人」聞之莫不掩鼻而過。在這裏，恐有損「體面」恕不詳論矣。</p>

<p>一枕鼾呼，怡然入萝，這睡覺却是人生最舒適酣暢的事兒；也是生活史上必可缺少的一頁。</p>
<p>洋房裏的老闊要睡覺，鴿子棚裏的窮鬼也要睡覺，睡着了倒貧富一律，苦樂相均。富人夢裏給綁票綁去，所創的事業失敗；姬妾跟人逃走·精神何曾安樂。窮人夢裏中香檳票：得航空券頭奬，雖是空歡喜，却得着暫時的歡娛，所以睡覺最是一件公正無私不偏不倚的東西這幾天氣候熱得可以，亭子間和擱樓上有朋友，對於睡眠，正有欲眠不得的苦。前天我到上海來看一個朋友，天夜了，不能回去，便留我寄宿在那裏，住慣了鄕間，一到湫隘狹小的房子裏，熱得像蒸籠裏一般，睡在床上，兀是不能入夢，聽他敲十一點鐘，十二點鐘。後來電燈熄了，我的臉上，好像有一顆微塵落上，用手一摸，却變成奇臭和濕軟的東西，接着身上脚上是。我知道是臭蟲下總擊令了，我抱着不抵抗主義，悄悄的披上衣服，到馬路上兜圈子。時候是夜深了，兩旁行人道上，却開了一個臨時露天旅館，有的掇了一張藤椅；有的擱了一塊木板：有的竟攤了一張破蓆在水門汀上。個個人鼻息高呼，好夢正酣。</p>
<p>我見了這般人舒適的睡覺，益令我興起不得安睡的苦楚。他們沒有臭蟲的攻擊：沒有熱氣的薰蒸，雖說夜深露凉容易受病，管他媽的，難道給臭蟲咬，給熱氣蒸，反而却病麽？樂得　　　　一些。我兩眼有些支撑不住了：兩脚有些酸軟了，回去睡吧丨那臭蟲，熱氣。怎能忍受呢？我恨不得和露天睡的朋友商量一下：「喂！朋友，讓開些，讓我來躺一下！」可是事實上怎能做得到呢！</p>

<p>雖然我是居住在外人管理下的租界内，但我的寓所却位於我人聚居的區域裏，所以每當午夜，便有各種聲音自由的輸送到沿馬路的我的臥室中來「嘩啦，」×公館的鐵門開了！「呼呼，」汽車的馬達發動起來。</p>
<p>「黃包車，大英照會？大英照會？」××號的傭婦打着揚州的滬白喊着。</p>
<p>「他媽的，不要把你給汽車軋死！」一個車夫把生意搶到手了，餘下的車夫這樣高聲的謾駡。</p>
<p>「老爺！太太！有那剩茶剩飯，賞給我窮人一口半碗，······」從乞丐破喉　裏發出來的悲調。</p>
<p>「桃花江的美人多，桃花千萬朶，及不上美人多！······」無線電的播音，</p>
<p>比較留聲機的發音洪亮得多了。</p>
<p>「阿行呀，回來吧！阿毛呀，······」這是從左近弄堂裏傳出來的呼聲，據說這樣呌喊，可以把重病將死的孩子的靈魂喚回來？</p>
<p>「咚咚」不魚的聲音，白雲深處的老僧，也會到繁華的都市中來凑熱鬧。</p>
<p>「嘭嘭···」一輛輛的機器脚踏車駛過。「嗚嗚···」一輛輛的汽車駛過。</p>
<p>這些嘈雜冗亂的聲音，每天在我的耳邊響奏着，雖然我是多麽的厭惡它們，然而它們却總是圍繞着我。</p>

<p>半個月之内，趙自强至少是回家來看過父親三次，然而一次也不曾遇着桂枝。最後一次，曾聽到桂枝說話，可是自己的皮鞋聲，在前院一路響着時，裏面的聲音，就突然的停住了。趙自强看到這種情形，覺得也有些奇怪，心裏想着，在槪是他煩膩了我們這種人物吧？因爲如此，每次走到前院，忍不住的那種咳嗽聲，終於也就强忍下去了。過了兩三天，上次來和桂枝作媒的那黃曼英女士，他又來了。他和趙翁談話，談得很晚，因之還是在楊家借宿。在坑上睡覺的時候，他就和江氏閑談說些北平城裏最近的情形，說是西單牌樓現在也添了個西安市塲，和東安市塲差不多。又說戲館子裏，現在好多地方，是男女合演。又說電影上的人，現在能夠說話，中國電影，就說的是京話。有聲電影，眞是有趣味，連放茶碗桌上，都有聲音。桂枝聽着，不由得心中大動，就向江氏道：媽，我們幾時也到北京城裏去玩兩天吧？讓我了去開開眼。江氏道：你倒說得好，進城去開開眼，别說買票的那些錢，咱們花不起，就是這兩頓飯，一塲睡，也沒有辦法。黃曼英這就說話了，他笑道：我到海甸來，可以在你們家吃，可以在你們家睡，你們到城裏去，就不能在我們那兒吃，我們那兒睡嗎？桂枝道：你府上的人，我們都不認識，怎好去打攪呢？黃曼英道：你這話，就說的更不對了。我初次到這兒來的時候，和你娘兒倆，可都不認識。你們留我吃，留我睡，我都不是同意了嗎？二位若是到我家去，還有我引着呢，那更是不要緊了。（一一八）</p>

<p>近來各國對於女性體質的研究非常注意，大槪普通婦人的體質，在形態上可分爲無力性型，力士型，肥滿型等三　。</p>
<p>無力性型這種形態，就是所謂柳腰楚楚的體質，身體瘦長，骨格縗弱，頸項與手足細長，胸靡扁平，皮膚現蒼白色，肌肉鬆弛，皮下脂肪很少，筋肉發育不良，體重很輕，全身少緊張性，曲腰駝背，這種資勢，差不多在婦女中，占百分之五六十肥滿型這與前型，適相反對，皮下脂肪的發育很旺，身體肥胖，常有陷於脂肪過多的困苦，妨碍營養的需，供給關係，每天所得的養分，都變爲脂肪性。這種形態，又可分爲食餌性肥胖症，體質性肥胖症，食餌性肥胖症，是貪食營養必要以上食物，終日一無所思，袛曉得吃吃　　，所得的營養分，很少消費，遂成爲非活動性有肥胖症。換句話說起來，就是像猪一樣的，大凡這種體質的婦人，生殖線的機能减退，在外表上，似很健康，實際上比瘦長的人，容易罹病。</p>
<p>力士型這種形態，其骨格與筋肉發育良好，全身的筋肉纎維組織，非常緊密，皮膚富有引力性，肩幅廣闊，胸廓發達，可以稱爲體全美的，以上三種形態，不過就普通外表上分類，可是詳細分起來，那因各人後天性與個人的特性，家庭的狀况等，就有幾百種樣子啊。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>口臭最爲人所厭惡，尤其爲男女兩性接近的重要障碍，愛情常爲口臭兩疏遠，美麗的容貎，也爲口臭而减色。傳說唐明皇初得了楊貴妃時，看伊容貎，的確姣豓，可是有口臭，後來有一位太醫，請貴妃多食鮮荔子，漸漸的口臭消除了。現在交際場中的婦女們，有口臭的人，十得八九，這種毛病，自己大都不知道的，即使經人說出，不過用些口香糖，搪塞了一時，總不明根本上的病源。照醫學上研究，口臭有因胃腸與呼吸器有病，若用鼻呼吸，就可以明白的。但是普通人的口臭，多因　齒的腐　而起，要試騐有否齦齒，可用牙籤挿入齒穴中，若牙籤有臭氣，那斷定其齒穴中，有齒蟲作祟了。其他因食後不潄口，把食物殘屑　入齒縫，腐敗發酵，由齒中流出澄汁，發生惡臭，或因患齒槽漏，在齒頭積有齒鹽腐敗發臭，還有一種患口内炎臭氣尤大，所以有口臭的人，第一要把齒根治療，第二每次食後立即把口内齒縫中刷凈，第三備除臭藥水，即用千倍的過錳鉀酸加里水，五倍的Ｏｘｙｆｕｌｌ　Ｐｅｒｓｏｎ的水溶液刷齒，並用硼酸水潄口，那末口臭就可以除去了。</p>

<p>丨並及於農村復興之關係丨蔣迪軒</p>
<p>棉花爲我國次於米麥之農産，紡織爲我國最大之工業，故其興衰，均與計民生有重大關係。近年以來，因棉産價給不足，致紡業日趨不振，而進口棉花及棉貨隨之增加，其結果則直接間接促進農村之衰落，請申其說。</p>
<p>棉貨爲我國主要之衣着原料，在昔大半仰給於舶來。自歐戰發生，國内新式紡業勃興，紗錠大增，進口棉貨始不繼續增加，然爲値仍達二萬萬兩之鉅，邇來關稅疊次提高，紡業似應再見發展，詎其情形，適相背馳，自二十年以降，卽日趨於不振，至近年而愈甚，卒至紗廠有最近之減工。其原因固由於紗銷呆滯，而花　　　　　國内棉産海關人超</p>
<p>十二年八·三一○·三五五六三九·七九七十三年七·一四四·六四二一六一·八六二十四年七·八一八·八八二一·○○六·六一八十五年七·五三四·三五一一·八六六·五○五十六年六·二四三·五八五九六八·五三二十七年六·七二二·一○八八○四·五八二十八年七·七四八·三六六一·五七一·○○○十九年八·八○九·五六七二·六三○·九四九二十年六·三九九·七八○三·八六二·八六四廿一年八·一○五·六三七三·○四九·五九二貴紗賤，應零尤巨。試檢近年標準紗花市價觀之，民國十八年全年高低平均價，標紗一六二，七○兩，標棉三二·六○兩，本年五月份標紗一二二·四○兩，標棉三○，二○兩，（本年標準等級已改算與十八年相等）兩相比較，本年紗跌四十兩，而花跌二兩五錢，跌價比率如此，紡廠營業可知。紗賤之原因，由於灌銷。花貴之原因，則由於棉産之不足。我國棉産，供不應求。始於民國八年，蓋棉花梅關入超，始於民八。其後紡錠增加，銷棉進步，而棉産則反告减退，供求相差愈大，外棉輪入愈多。最近十年間我國棉産供給與消費情形略如下表：（單位担）</p>

<p>海關人　，全國進口棉花，除去出口棉花之凈數；紡廠消費，爲紗廠所用之數量；此外衣被塡塞用棉。尙未算入，卽供給與銷費之差數是已。從上表中，已顯見我國棉花在量的方面，供不敷求，必持外棉以擴其不足，而近年輸入外棉之激增，其原因尙不僅限於量之一端，社會進步，紡織品趨精，紗支提高，原料亦由粗絨而改用細絨。我國所謂能供較高紗支紡製之細絨，卽嗣内所産洋棉，據調查洋棉量額十八年二○七九五四三擔，十九年三一六九八八九擔，二十年二五二三六五○擔二十一年三○六五九九五擔，平均每年不及三百萬擔。而因品質之退化，及棉商攙粗關係，此三百萬擔洋棉實際能供細紗紡製之用者，不及其半，殆不過一百五十萬擔，以目前國内所出細紗數量比較，相差甚遠。最近四年國内紡廠銷用各種棉花比率如下：</p>
<p>中棉美棉印度棉埃及棉其他十八年六八·二五一三·六六一七·九九○·○四○·○十九年六三·一一一三·六○二二·七六○·二一○·三二十年四九·六七二六·四三二三·二元○·四三○·一八廿一年五二·一三三八·五八八·八一○·四五○·○三美棉及埃及棉盡屬細絨，中棉中有一部份屬於細絨，印棉及其他棉均屬組絨。四年以來，中棉减少，美棉激增，印度棉二十一年大減，埃及棉增率亦大，已顯見細絨銷用之進步，嗣内所産之細絨，殊不足以應需求，此爲近年輸入美棉驟增之特殊原因。二十年份進口外棉共値一七九○八二二四六兩，躍居海關貨値之第一位，國人夙聞悔關漏巵，棉貨最巨之言，初不料棉花之迅速進步，竟棉貨之地位而代之，此於國家財富上之損失至巨，而其影響於棉業與農村之衰落者爲之深也。</p>
<p>農村經濟，端賴生産品之輸出，易取現金，以　買所需之　料，加此　　，農村與都市屬之金　乃鮑流動，近年棉産數量低不隨紡　俱增，致紡織原料取　　外者觀占其半，而此半數外棉所紡織之布疋，　又多運餉於内地農村。是棉花入　損失，　完全爲　内農村所負擔，二十一年進口棉値一萬八千萬兩，無異農村因産棉不能與用布相適合，須付出一萬八千萬金以補其不足，此一萬八千萬兩之　剩，第一步由紡廠而惟出國外，　紡廠織成布疋，則運入農村吸現取現金以補償之。自十二年至二十一年之十年間，進口棉花，其値九萬三千萬兩，卽逐年因農民不能生産相當之紡織原料，在衣着方面所負之損失。近年棉花之生意不增，輸人外棉益鉅，此外米麥兩項亦復如此，農村又安得而不陷於幾瀕崩潰之境·同時紡織業，一方圓因國内原料缺乏，不得已向國外購棉，外棉價昂，輸入有稅，已足使管業趨於不利。另一方面農村旣因生産品不能與銷費品平衡，金　外溢，財力匱乏，購買能力，當然薄弱，致紗布需要大減，上海存紗，遂達十六萬包之多。故曰紡業與農村之衰落，直接間接與棉産缺乏有關係也。</p>
<p>棉爲我國次於米麥之農産，紡織爲國内最大之工業，故救濟棉業，固應注意棉産，卽復興最村。植棉亦屬要端。假使進口之四百萬擔棉花産於國内，卽農村增多一萬八千萬金之收入，裨益農村經濟。實非淺鮮。同時農民購買能力自增。上海十六萬包之存紗，亦不脛而走矣。國内棉産欲增四百萬担，不但可能，且極容易。江蘇湖北兩省，已稱爲我國産棉最著之地。但據調查，此兩省荒地可墾以植棉者，較現有之棉田面積尤多。江蘇海濱鹽墾區域，皆能植棉，其面積發達全國現有棉田之半。推面西北之河南陜西尤不勝計。友人李國楨若，主持陜西植棉，致書於余，　涇惠渠成，可增棉區三百萬畝。　而國内棉産，年年排徊於八百萬擔，歎　且不及此，易質　化，更不待言，此中原因，當然甚多，試分直接間接，舉其着者言之。</p>
<p>直接方面，當然爲未能致力於植棉之改進，政府旣無　爲之，民衆或　爲之，則又有種種之阻力，致改進植棉，只是紙上空談，絶少實際工作。美棉之得有今日，爲美農部慘淡經營之功，回顧我國則如何？印度淪爲英之殖民地，尤有中央植棉委員會之設，回顧我國又如何？林棉改進，苟能稍稍致力，利之所在，人之所趨，因勢利導，收效如操左劵。浙江向産最粗最短之棉，紡紗僅十支，今亦能産紡三十二支之棉矣。糊南素不産棉，今則産棉逾二十萬担，而品質且趨於湖北。他如山東陜西，皆著相當效果，亦卽當局稍稍致力之功。江蘇夙爲國内産棉第一，近則産量品質，均告退化，並非江蘇忽然不宜植棉，要亦當局漠視之故。茲卽以江蘇與湖南相較，一進一退，對於農村對於紡業，關係如何？故我人正可不必提高聲調，大唱而特唱其救濟農村，使平時而稍稍注意農村，必不至一潰若此，至改進植棉之技術問題，條理斯繁，茲不具論。</p>
<p>以言間接的關係，我國不特未能致力於植棉之改進，而足以妨碍植棉發展者，殊不勝言。試舉其著者，㈠棉區多在内地，而銷棉之紡廠，則在口岸。棉花由産地運至紡廠，捐稅重疊，一征再征，陜豫之棉東運，稅項名稱，煩不勝舉。近則營業稅行，棉花每一轉手，征稅一次，負擔之重，幾與外棉輸入相同。㈡運輸不便，運費奇重，亦爲影響棉産發展之原因，某年陜棉囤積三年不能東運，價亦奇賤，東南方告棉荒，此種情形，時時有之，陜省最宜長絨棉之生長，國内需要長絨日多，其植棉理應發達，事實則殊不然。卽受運輸多阻之賜。至運費之重，更無待言，由西北而至上海，每不下於美棉之至我國，而沿途阻擱，尤無把握也。㈢棉商攙雜攙潮，官廳雖三令五申，而不作實際之取締。陜豫之棉，每有長幾及一寸半者，乃與長不及八分者相混，致長絨亦失其價値。農民植長絨而不能得長絨棉應得之價，又不能致諸實用，妨害棉産改進，莫此爲甚。攙潮現已有檢騐之局，但廠商收買棉花。罰惡而不賞善如棉花水分在十二斤以上者則扣價，在十二斤以下者並不加價，致爲效較淺。凡此數端，致廠家有用中棉不如用外棉之嘆。在當局固以稅收及運費爲目的。詎知農村衰落，農産不增，稅收與運費，亦將同歸於烏有，此種竭澤而漁之政策，行之旣久，釀成今日之景象，理所當然，故須　接立圓，亦不必　　復興救濟，能於足以妨碍其進展之病因，在可能範　，加以合理合法之整飭，農村與棉業，生機自蘇矣。</p>

<p>合作是近百年來世界上新興的經濟組織，在各國都已有相當的成績。而正式介紹到中國，也有了十多年的歷史，這十多年以來，先有學者的鼓吹，後有政府的提倡，合作運動，也從宣傳提倡進而至實行組織的時期。各省各地合作社的組織成立，也呈了空前的進展。據二十一年份的統計，全國已有合作社二·六七三所，社員總數九八七七八八。這個數字，看來似乎很大·可是拿全國人口四萬八千萬來比較，只佔了萬分之二，還是渺乎其小的一個數目，更談不上來和歐洲先進的國家來相提並論。</p>
<p>合作運動的不能普遍發達而收實效，實益，這不能歸罪於提倡的同志。袛怪多數的民衆是阿斗，是沒字碑。對於合作這種事業，出娘胎也沒有聽過見過，腦袋裏沒有半點影子。所以提倡的人儘管喊破喉嚨，他們還是莫名其妙。這種對牛彈琴的工作，當然是徒勞無益了。不得已有一部分提倡的人，採用利誘的策略，告訴他們，如果組織了合作社，政府可以借錢給他們做資本。這一些甜頭，固然有了相當的效力。很有許多農民，懷着十二分的希望，成立了合作社，袛可惜甜頭只不過是一種口惠，許多合作社因爲借不到錢又成了統計上的紀錄。</p>
<p>失敗是成功之母，已往的錯誤，給了我們不少的敎訓，們知道在猶太民族中間，也有一種合作的組織，呌做阿克奇亞（Ａｘｉａ）這種阿克奇亞，從東歐傳到西歐，又傳到亞洲北美，到了十九世紀的後半期，歐洲的合作運動起來了，順了潮流的趨向，阿克亞也受洗禮。現在美國的阿克奇亞，有不少經過了登記的手續，成了合法的組織，受了信用組合（Ｃｒｅｄｉｔ　Ｕｎｉｏｎ）法的保護。阿克奇亞的信用合作化，實在是合作運動中値得研究的一點現在合作制度，介紹到我國，已經有十多年了。幾年來注入式的宣傳。成效還是很小。記得胡漢民先生曾經在「怎樣推行合作事業」裏說：「合作是一個很好的名詞，但我們萬勿震於合作這個好名詞·而忽略了我國固有的合作事業。我國固有的合作事業，雖無合之名，却有合作之實。」胡先生所　「有合作之實，無合作之名的我國固有的合作事業」，是說合會制度。他以爲如果能切實依合作的原理改進他，使他能眞實適應人民的要求，一定能成爲民間調劑金融的良好的組織。</p>
<p>合會是我國民間固有的合作制度，又呌「集會」，俗名是「蟠桃」，也還有人用「人字頭」三字做代名詞，這幾種都是江南太湖流域的名稱。到江北淮揚一帶，呌做「請會」；安徽江西湖北湖南···各省，呌做「打會」：浙東的金衢嚴各府屬，呌做「聚會」，寗紹一帶，又呌「糾會」，兩廣方面名稱是「做會」，雲南省却又呌「賖會」，這種的名稱字眼雖然不同，意義都是一樣，方法也是大同小異。所不同的，各地的合會，多少帶一些風土的色彩。合額的大小·會期的長短，會脚的多少，會利的高低，有一些不同罷了。</p>
<p>合會雖說是各地各異其法，可是意義精神都是一貫的。這種値得贊美的民間固有的合作制度，我們也應該像阿克奇亞一樣，使也受合作的洗禮，使他爲東亞合作史樹立一枝崛起的異軍。合作運動如果能夠利用這一種民間的合作基礎，無異地得了一條合作到民間去的㨗徑，於合作的進展上，一定會生很大的影響。</p>
<p>從使用合會的一些說，我們還得先說一說合作社的當前困難。現在多數合作社的組織，目的無非想借一些錢，所以組織的時候，只求其成立得快，社員固然隨便拉攏，社費也都照最低限度徴集。並且多數的合作社的因爲借欵數的關係，都是無限責任性質。等到成立登記的手續辦理完了，不論是借到欵子的，或者沒有借到欵子的，大槪不再去計劃社務的進行。所以成立了一二年的合作社，社股還是以前的數字，儲蓄更沒有一些的紀錄。這種只知靠人，不求自立的合作社，雖多何用？</p>
<p>要合作事業樹立起穩固的基礎，必須先糾正已往的錯誤。合作社如果想從現在的陰　中，打出一條生路，非從勵行社員儲蓄政策不可，而合會制度的應用，也是提倡社員儲蓄的一種方法。這樣一來，不但儲蓄可以實現，並且社員間的關係，也可以因此理加密切。</p>
<p>合作社如果要應用合會制度來發展他的儲蓄業務，也不能囫圇呑棗，必須將合會制度，酌量改造，使不背合作的原則。假定我們拿標會來做改造的對象，個人的意見，有下面幾點：</p>
<p>㈠組織問題由合作社組織的標會，頭會就是合作社。分做若干組，每組的會脚，從十五人到二十人，限於合作社的社員。第一期歸合作社收會，作爲基金，不出利息，並且以後的標頭，也能夠派到。</p>
<p>㈡會金問題標會的會金，看會脚的（即社員的）給濟力量而定，至少二元，至多十元。一位社員，至少認定半會，至多二三會。</p>
<p>㈢會期問題會期也看當地的習慣而定，至多每月一次，或二個月三個月一次。</p>
<p>㈣標頭問題標會的利率，由合作社規定很高很低的限制，照複利算出每期標頭的最大最小數目。使先得後收，都不吃虧。會脚投標，不能夠超出最高限制。如果有二人以上同投最高的標價，那末收會人以次高投標人遞補。每期的標頭，都由合作社保管，到滿會時再行分派。</p>
<p>㈤會額分配會脚標得會欵，必須照會額提出十分之二，以十分之一購買合作社的股份，另以十分之一，作爲儲蓄存欵。並且要提出價値相當的保證品，信用的保證也可以，才可以支欵。</p>
<p>這是一個大槪的設計，很希望合作社的試行和專家的指敎。</p>

<p>現在已有的批發合作社所積極努力的，是擴充批發組織，選取商業與交通的中紐，建築社址，蓋造堆棧，創辦工廠，及各種生産組織，并且設法把各種色彩的合作社結合起來，以統一全國合作運動的力量。荷蘭的批發社成立已久，到去年才在羅特丹姆建築一座偉大的批發社，全國的合作社，都是會社社員之一。今後的發達。正未可限量。一國的合作在有了完備的批發社後，才能製定貨品的商標，才能進而自行生産。否則難是資本充足，也因消路的缺乏。無從雜持。所謂商人合作社，就是零售商人組織起來，應用批發方法，共同購買的組織，所以目下各國的合作運動，即在對付零售商人，都有以全力去推進批發合作，使其成爲一個完備的健全的組織之必要。是則合作社的這種努力，乃在適應内外的兩重要求。</p>
<p>㈣分店制的推行丨合作運動，是資本主義的産物，一切措施也隨資本主義的企業方法而日新月異。分店制度未普及於商業中之前，合作即已有類似之組織。近因商業上的分店辦法在食物方面，非常發達，使合作社特别注目於責任分店制度。資本主義的大商店，常於開張之始，即在城市的每區以至全國的各鎭，分設支店，他們的貨品，旣是自己生産或大批購入，兼以經理和運輸等方面的合理化，成本自然較低。而且顧客隨地可以購到所需用之物。不必跑到離家很遠的所在去買東西。瑞士消費合作社在聯合和統一兩步驟成功之後，社員所散佈的區域甚廣，假使沒有分店，困難尤多。所以近年這種運動，發展甚速。我們在瑞士的巴爾城走動，到處都見有紅門面的淸潔而美麗的玲瓏小店，這正是上下兩巴爾消費合作社的分店。而且這種分店，一區内覽有三數所之多，分别售消内類雜貨等可以獨立辦理的物品。我們這次在調查歐洲合作運動時，特别看出這趨勢。</p>
<p>㈤中立趨向之普遍地丨合作是不問政治和宗敎信仰的自由組織。自尼墨學派以消費者爲中心立定了中立的原則以後，更爲各國合作社所服膺。即是骨子裏爲一政黨或一敎派所主辦所把持的合作社，表面上仍以中立爲口號，一以團結内部，一以號召社會，比利時的合作運動，是比利時社會黨與工會的淵源。直至今日。還是和政黨與工會通力協作，可說是三位一體。比利時的合作局·是比利時合作的中央組織，去冬局中的主持人和我們說起政黨與合社的關係，曾有將使兩者獨立的說話。因爲過去的事實告訴我們，合作的發達，常受政黨的影響。這種影響，還只有經濟的。至於意大利的往事，簡直是因政治而根本被人破壞。這次希特拉上臺，雖然未有得到關於合作社的消息，但是照我們在德國時所聽見的情形看來，深悉漢堡消費合作聯合下的合作社，也要和當日意大利的合作社同一命運。總之這種中立的原則，致使在實際上不見有顯著的應用，然而各國的合作者天天都在那裏宣傳着。</p>
<p>這個簡略的介紹，不能說是闡明了歐洲合作運動的趨勢。對此有特别興趣的閱者，希望能夠將來一讀我們正在草撰的歐洲合作運動考察報告一書。</p>

<p>— 耀</p>
<p>我要觀光小菜塲的决心已懷了好久；在鄕鎭上是沒有賣買疏菜，魚肉的集合地的，所以難怪鄕下人對大都市裏的小菜塲發生了好奇。終于在一個星期日的淸晨踏進了小菜塲！</p>
<p>這裏擺着各色各樣的攤，有的賣鮮魚，有的賣鮮肉，鮮蝦鮮······等。有各種不同的擔子，有豆類，有蔬菜類有瓜類。由各個販賣者的面部表情上看來，知道他們都在期待着今朝能有越常的主顧丨像農夫期待有豐裕的秋收一樣丨有的破喉嚨儘喊着他們的貨物是怎樣賤，怎樣好以招徠主客，有的在他的貨品上灑水，有的在放冰，以求暢銷丨或者因了一二枚銅元的上下竟不能成功交易，　　因論價的衝突以致口角甚至弄成一套全武行，買的方面有稍能過活的商人婦，東論價西秤貨地想得些便宜貨有公館裏的廚司娘姨，大姐，她們和他們盤算着今天買些什麽東西可討主人的歡心而自己可揩些油，一個個都捻緊了錢，不肯經易成交易；有薄有幾個錢的少奶奶，太太，因隔晚打了幾圈麻將，眼皮還緊緊的，若不勝其疲癆，你若能看見她臨走時籃裏貨物的多少，就可决定她昨夜的雀戰是勝利抑失敗，有勞働者凑准了他所帶的銅元數來換人家選剩下來的殘貨；有江北小販，難民模樣的人在爭奪着人家剝下來的黃葉和腐敗得不堪的鮮貨，</p>
<p>在這裏你能顯然的見到：</p>
<p>都市裏的人們也是一樣的肯爲生活掙扎：</p>
<p>都市裏的人們也是一樣的吝惜着金錢！</p>

<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>鬼儡，又名木偶，本來并不拘全是木頭製的，像用薄的皮，或硬的紙，剪裁着　等，　在圓圈上頭中心留軸孔，像車輪，中間燃以燭，再套上較高外塗白紙的圓圈，由人力推之使動，便團團轉的循道前進，俗謂皮鬼儡，有名走馬燈，雖然不很普遍，但至少有相當見到的人們。</p>
<p>再有較普及的，要算是江北人在上海弄的鬼儡戲了，她們的確有佔着木頭的成份，因爲較普及，小老母庸多形容她的構造了，以前城隍廟，或空的荒地，有時可以見到，現在怕是更多了！閘北自一二八戰後。空荒的地更多起來，所以見到的機會是更多了：這亦得讚一聲江北人聰明！差不多五尺見方的武台，裏頭藏蓄了鑼，鼓，等樂器，鬼儡背後支配的人，他同時要使鬼儡活動，說話，鑼鼓鳴，這麽是只由一個支撑着，所以算他是聰明；不過下頭的說話，觀衆們怕會更希罕了！因爲鬼儡自身會說假話來哩。</p>
<p>在未說出會說起話來的鬼儡的構造，我得再介紹一下，因其構造全不像上說兩種；臉孔雖有不同，但倒像我們南國出品一般的脗合，可說是一種罕見的東西，不，非生長在南國的人，怕會沒有見到！不過現在假如需要看的話，亦有看内去處來了，就是大白渡橋一帶的花邊店裏，何以看到，他們呌作Ｍａｎｄａｒｉｎ－ｄｏｌｌ，聽說外國人現在還買了擺在家裏當Ｊｏｓｓ拜，習了我們貴中國的風，但是他們只是鮮花·淸香，和白臘罷了：現在我得附帶多說一下，賣的那些，只是南國用作鬼儡戲的胚胎而已，還沒裝上支配其動作的握柄：動作的握柄共有三枝，是鐵如竹製成的，一裝在身軀的背後，使支撑她能豎立自如，二枝各裝配在她左右手上，這些是比較江北人的，來得麻煩點，因爲每一個人，只能夠運用一個，說話，當然亦得用人替說，簡直一切都由背後的人支配，彷彿有點像大世界裏頭的雙簧，不過鬼儡戲是很小罷了。</p>
<p>近來的鬼儡戲，是愈演愈進步了，古老式那些，怕會受到不竟象呵！確是進步得多，現在鬼儡背後那三枝握柄，亦整練得會說話，無須背後支配的人運用，而且還能提案，主事，不過科舉昌明的近世，這亦不算什麽希奇的一回事，我們應希奇的，還是鬼儡自身說起話，而和那握柄爭短長丨她說的話，觀衆們很想聽吧？讓俺就寫在下面：「你們作趕盡殺絶的事，呌我担名挨駡，這又何苦來，你們安份一些，給子孫留點餘地罷，······你等有關東軍作主，何必找我來，我辭了，」丨丨見廿七日申報（趙欣伯，熙洽，鄭孝胥，對滿洲僞國查封昔日東三省各權要財産，慫恿關東軍首腦部一律處置······）的北平通訊丨事實是這麽奇突，雖然現世科學昌明，發明得鬼儡像活人，但是握柄三根，若與鬼儡要是不合作，怕會仍各成廢物哩，背後支配的人呀，你雖然能夠廢物利用，但究竟還欠聰明，不像我們的江北人呵！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我們眼見現在社會的環境，一天一天的變遷着，不斷地向着那黑暗無光的路上轉去；已致現在的人們，亦隨着他的轉變。人心一天壞一天；尤其是我們這些的靑年男女們，品行也變壞了。受着社會潮流的引誘，已致許多有爲的靑年們，一變而爲一個下流的人；唉！社會到了這樣的田地，眞可怕得很！因爲這樣的緣故，所以我就想組織一個「靑年品行糾察團，」來警戒這些靑年們，向着光明的大道走去。您說道個組織好嗎？對於法律上有關係麽？請您好好的指敎我哩！敬祝夏安。田玉卿謹上××××</p>
<p>編者安：靑年的品行，一天一天地向墮落的方面鑽，誠然是民族前途絶大的危險。田君有鑒於此，想設法去糾正，卓見實在佩服。不過田君所提議的那個辦法，實在不爲法律所許可。現在一般靑年所做的不正當行爲，都半還沒有到犯法的地位，或者雖已犯法，而所犯的是親告罪。除非直接受害人之外，其他的人，就無權去顧問了。所以你組織糾察團去干預他，是不合法的。弄得不好，自己反會犯「妨害自由」「妨害秘密」等類的法規。我們以爲這個會的用意旣屬正當，可以略爲變通，就不致爲法律所不許了。第一這個團的名稱因改爲靑年砥礪團等一類的名字。第二糾察的範圍袛限於曾經塡過志願書的團員。第三倘使這樣嫌伊效力太小，那末可以用宣傳的方法，把團員的數量擴大。</p>

<p>夜間靜寂寂的，一個人悶在斗室裏總免不了一種淪落的感想，由于王化的借錢又想起了衣袋裏的飯票只有四張了，不禁抽了一口冷氣。「唉，······要有力量，要有羣衆，才肯拿錢書來呵！好吧，照他這樣辦吧。」但是，我們的力量和羣衆在那裏呢？他的心重新又懸起來，的確，石喬素來是一個愛好文樂的人，尤其這兩年忙于生活的追逐，羣衆活動久就隔膜了，而且他的淸高癖也就根本看不起王化的所謂羣衆，現在可怎樣辦呢？這當然是越想越想不出結果的，他便自暴自棄的橫倒在牀上。</p>

<p>這一晚，無論　的思想，感情，怎樣千變萬化，最後終只歸結到「明早怎樣向陳天任說話呢丨呵，明早要早起來的丨」便這樣勉强地睡覺了。</p>

<h3 id="c267">日本電影事業的新動向（上） <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>檢查影片和接吻問題之奇特</p>
<p>利用電影爲國際宣傳的工具</p>
<p>日本的報章雜誌，近來對於電影檢查會，時常加以攻擊，說是他們檢查影片，是如何的嚴格；其實，並不如此，在一部分人看來，日本的電影檢查，對於影片的檢查，向來很寬大的。在日本，所有的影片。審查的時候，平均二十五張的中間，要彼檢查會剪截的是三張。可是在美國，審查過的影片，五張之中倒有三張要剪截。就這一點上，我們便不能去苛責日本的電影檢查會？在日本每天須經電影檢查會審的影片，大槪有二十張，但在這裏我們可牢記一個共同的條件，那便是他們審查電影的主要問題，第一就是這影片的内容，是否足以影響日本民衆的道德。在影片中特殊的一段，時常要遇到剪刀的，便是接吻的一段。在别個邦國之中，在影片的上面，接吻的序幕，未必盡遭剪去。但在日本却不然，衹要接吻不管它是否妨害風化，完全要剪去的。這原因，就在接吻是和日本的風俗習慣，完全處於相反的地位，而且又是純粹的西方禮節。日本的觀衆，看見銀幕上的接吻，會狂笑起來，因爲他們不知道接吻是什麽一回事。而日本電影檢查會對於國外的影片、所要剪去的，也就是這種含有肉感色彩的接吻，至於以接吻而當做眞愛的表示，像丈夫和妻子，丈母和兒女愛人和愛人表示眞愛的接吻，檢查會是保存而不剪去的。自從聲片發明以後，新問題又發生了銀幕的上面，接吻的時候還可發出一種聲音，檢查會對於有聲音的接吻，也要剪去因爲日本的影迷對於這種接吻聲是不歡迎的。日本的導演，有時採用新方法，利用女人的手臂挽在男人的肩膀上，或是脚跟脫離了地板，這兩種是暗示要接吻的方法，但檢查會對於這種地方也是要剪去的。</p>
<p>然而，無論如何，在日本，因爲受外來影片的影響，接吻這件事，遲早總要得到當局的允許，不拘檢查會或私人的好惡終究有現實的一天。因爲日本人近來對於接吻的眞意，已漸漸的明瞭起來，所以在不久的將來，在相當的限度之内，接吻一定可以在銀幕上看見了。不過現在還是不可能呢丨此外審查會所注意的，就是一張影片，對於日本的政治和社會制度，是否有危害的地方，蘇俄的影片，就爲了這個原故，不能在日本公映，然而又有人說蘇俄的影片，是不合於日本人的胃口，所以日本人是不歡迎的、同時和日本人的想像更是不適合。據日本的檢查會說來，近來美國的影片，因爲迎合下等社會的一天多似一天，所以審查工作，也日見困難了。（未完）</p>

<p>茲據橫太平洋通訊社柏林電訊，世界最先發明活動電影之人，爲德人斯喀拉且諾夫斯基氏。ＭａｘＳｋｌａｄａｎｏｗｓｋｙ彼今年已七十，距發明時已埀四十年，惟雄名湮沒，知者極尠。現德國宣傳部部長高博爾氏深悉其秘；特往訪斯氏於其故居。高氏見斯龍鍾老態，不覺爲之惻然。歸後即公布消，表揚其事，并爲組織一特别委員會，爲斯氏籌劃善後之策，復爲發啓捐欵。政府亦擬追贈獎金以酬其功。按斯氏發明電影遠在一八九五年。是年十一月一日斯氏曾在柏林將其新發明向政府註册，同日並在柏林公開試映其活動電影。一時見者目撀布幕上人物之影，幢幢往來，均目爲怪異，爲之撟舌不置。惜氏困於資釜，未能繼續精研。而後起者已聞風接踵而起，致氏受數十載之埋沒，殊可惜也。</p>

<h3 id="c269">評「辣手懲淫」ＴｈｉｓＳｐｏｒｔｉｎｇ　Ａｇｅ <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>幾乎是每一個美國電影都一樣，無論在怎樣的一個故事中，總免不了要有戀愛的穿挿。一般的說來，本片應當冠以「武俠片」的頭銜，然而「打武」的場面，並不佔主要部份，反之，戀愛的描寫，却努力的攝製了許多，而跑馬打球的畫面。不過是一些熱鬧的穿挿。因此假如說本片作者原來以武俠爲本意，却不免有反主爲賓的毛病。</p>
<p>但是，他們旣然放鬆了打武的主要題材而着重於愛的描畫，那末對於後者又是怎樣描寫的呢？我覺得如畫面上所表顯出的，到底沒有一個中心的描寫。假使主角史蒂爾在作者的心目中是一個模範人物，有如他對待下級人員的公正不苛，那末他對於那一個寡婦，就應當潔身目愛。難道他可以殺害淫亂自己女兒的馬萊爾而可以不必責己嗎？當然，他並不能算是「完人」何况所謂「暗箭殺人，算不了英雄好漢」。那末他的女兒應當是模範人物了？不錯，作者對於她確有一貫的描寫，可是他的貞節是否又是每一個觀衆都能同情的呢？至於女兒和那靑年的戀愛塲面，在劇中更無必要。</p>
<p>以上是就其故事的結構加以此判。至於在意義上更是空無所有。</p>
<p>然而本片的導演技巧，在小的方面倒是很可以看看的。雖然對於劇情的妥貼，導演原負有主要責任，特别是對於如上述的主角個性的矛盾，可是他在Ｍｏｎｔａｇｏ方面，却有大部份的成功。例如自那少女和好色漢在舞場相識以至於被淫，道中間的過程，都寫得非常仔細而充分。又如少女打電話至寡婦家裏，輕描淡寫的說明她父親和寡婦的淫亂，也是很靈活的手腕。再則如那馬夫在馬脚下所看見的接吻，以及少女在最初騙父親離開那個寡婦，都見聰明。然而除此以外，導演對於少女殺的塲面却是仍嫌不夠。道應當是一最緊張的塲合。但是輕鬆的滑過了。然而這正是他盡力帮助演員的地方，因爲這原來是難於表演所以便取巧的帶過。後面大團圓的幾個鏡頭，未免是蛇足。少女服毒後臥病諸幕，俱嫌不妥。</p>
<p>表演方面，那個主角Ｊａｃｓ　Ｈｏｌｔ很見精神。是劇中最成功的一個。飾少女的雖然大部份都還過得去，然而不能有吃力的表演。那個好色漢的角色對於調情很能體貼。馬夫也保持了過去的成績。至於少女的情人却是最軟弱的一個。</p>
<p>整個的說，這决不是成功的作品。</p>

<p>— 侯楓</p>
<p>丨是一部値得注意的非戰影片丨</p>
<p>當此亞洲雲緊急之時，我們對於這「戰塲地獄」“Ｎｏ　Ｍａｎ’ｓ　Ｌａｎｄ”出現在銀幕上的重大意義，實在是不能不加以重視的我們知道「海闊天空」一類的影片係對於軍國國民的敎育意義，那麽，我們對這「戰場地獄」的非戰和給予人以和平的啓示，無疑的，是値得我們去體騐，和深切地去意味着這一非戰的意義的。</p>
<p>這「戰場地獄」寫着五個不同職業，然而，同樣的是度着安全而甜密的生活的人，被那第一次世界大戰的颶風，捲吹到戰場的地獄裏去。本來在戰場上這五個不同國籍的人，該是刀槍相向的，可是，一到這地獄裏面，大家都掙扎在那死線之上的時候那種共同的痛苦與悲哀，便掩滅了們的仇心，而强有力地使他們在那共圖生存的意義底下，同心協力地向着和平之路發進。</p>
<p>導演者是抱着「非戰的决心的·」所以每一幕戲，都含有「非戰」的意義。雖然，在前半部描寫那五個不同職業的人的生活，有點鬆懈全劇之嫌，但，用那種反襯的寫法，倒是値得稱贊的，尤其在最後一個場面丨那五個人手携手的縱破碎的戰壕裏出來，把那些阻礙他們走進和平之境的鐵絲綱，協力地剷除，這樣的把戰場的地獄炸燬了！這不能不說是導演者的聰明。</p>
<p>談到表演，分飾那五個掙扎在死綫上的不同國籍的人。都很不錯，尤其是那個黑人。其餘的雖然沒有多的表演機會，但，那種「非戰」的精神，却是每一個人的共同的表現丨丨暴露出來。</p>
<p>因此，我們覺得這「戰場地獄」雖不能算是一部盡善盡美的佳片，然而，那種「非戰」意義在這人心惶惶於大戰之將</p>
<p>臨的現在，是値得注意的啊！</p>

<p>兩個女子思春·碰着了兩個男子獵艷，碰着就愛，由愛而姤，由姤面爭，於是乎讒言，破壞，設會，反目，然後來一個天公作美，房子又炸毁了，女子危急男子勇救，團圓。這就是乾柴烈火！</p>
<p>在劇情與畫面，「乾柴」「烈火」的確是雙關二意，各符其實了。然而有什麽意義？意義在什麽地方，慚愧得很，不知道！</p>
<p>暴露資本主義制度下婚姻問題的不平麽？太不夠！描寫愛情與友情的衝突麽？太潦草！</p>
<p>假如不是在畫面上比較還好看的美國片，我眞是一點也不原諒它！</p>
<p>因爲：第一，故事太平凡，第二，立意不淸楚，像是愛情友情的衝突，但愛情友情都不成立。曼克旣那麽壞，吉梅旣那麽好，二人决不能成爲至友。如果是至友。曼克破壞吉梅與潘琪的事·至少曼克應該是眞正愛潘琪的人，但事實上，曼克是無賴。而吉梅如果眞是愛潘琪，那他聽了曼克與媚麗的幾名讒言，就致生氣而遺棄，未免太淺薄！</p>
<p>總之，這因平凡的故事，實在平凡得毫無價値了，使人看過，旣提不起任何一類的情感，也得不到一點比較深刻的印象。雖然導演者拚命地用了烈火。好在，導演者還聰明，分幕淸楚·鏡頭靈活，穿挿適當，Ｍｏｎｔａｇｅ的前後照應，尙能使這平凡的故事，生出了一些不大平凡的畫面來，而Ｊａｍｅｓ　Ｄｕｎｎ與Ｚａｓｕ　Ｐｉｔｔｅｓ的演出，也很自然。對白也有趣而淸楚，爲這片生色不少。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Peining Railway Opens Traffic Service Between Peiping and Tangshan This Morning <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Armed Police Escort and Carry Road Repair Materials</p>
<p>Japanese Troops' Complete Withdrawal Postponed Indefinitely</p>
<p>People of Six Counties East of Peiping Oppose Incorporation of Puppet Troops into Police</p>
<p>(Tientsin) The Peining Railway is scheduled to run a train to Tangshan at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. The first train will carry materials, and the second will be a traffic service train. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the Peining Railway reopening, the Japanese side has agreed to two conditions: 1. Japanese and puppet troops along the line will be withdrawn to locations farther away. No Japanese soldiers will be stationed at the stations. The Peining Railway will be allowed to dispatch unarmed police to escort trains through Japanese defense areas, with Japanese military police boarding the train to maintain order. 2. Two round-trip passenger trains will run daily. The next step is to extend the service to Qinhuangdao. Because Japanese troops east of Tangshan have not yet withdrawn, the Peining Railway Bureau has already prepared a test train. The Director of the Secretariat, Mr. Si Tili, will travel to Tangshan on this train. If it passes safely, the second passenger train will begin service on the 4th. The railway administrative rights of each station will also be returned to the Peining Railway. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) A Peining Railway traffic service train, along with materials for repairing the railway line, has been prepared. As Japanese soldiers are required to escort the train, the date of departure depends on the decision of the Japanese military authorities. According to railway news, it may still be difficult to start the service on the 3rd. However, resuming the Peiping-Tangshan train service seems to be without problems. Nakamura intends to await the final news from the Dalian conference before dispatching troops to protect the traffic service train's departure. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Receiving Committee will appoint inspectors to lead police to take over the counties. The police force will consist of 10,000 personnel, allocated to the 59 counties based on their size. The first meeting will be held in Tientsin on the 6th and 7th, pending the return of Lei Shourong and two others to Tientsin. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, and Xue Zhiheng telegraphed Peiping today, reporting that all issues are expected to be discussed within two days. If a satisfactory resolution can be reached, they will leave Dalian on the 5th and arrive in Tientsin on the 6th. The future takeover procedures will be decided after Lei returns to Tientsin. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The takeover of the war zone counties cannot begin until at least ten days later. Currently, negotiations are underway regarding the first step of restoring transportation and the issue of puppet troops. If these are resolved smoothly, the takeover can proceed without obstacles. Japanese troops west of Tangshan have indeed withdrawn. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Kwantung Army recently convened division commanders for a conference in Dalian, and also sent Chief of Staff Koiso to participate and provide guidance to discuss issues such as the troops stationed along the Great Wall line. Now that the conference has ended, the division commanders have all departed, but Koiso remains in Dalian, instructing Kwantung Army representatives and Li Chun, Kan Duo, etc., to negotiate with our Receiving Committee members Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, and Yin Tong on all matters. It is expected to be completed in two or three days. Xue, Lei, and others will return immediately after the talks to participate in the second Tanggu conference. Our War Zone Receiving Committee members Li Zeyi, Liu Shisun, Wei Jian, and Qian Zongze remain in Tientsin, assisting Yu Xuezhong in conducting everything as needed. Tao Shangming returned to Peiping last night on official business. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The traffic issue on the Peining Railway was negotiated by Qian Zongze with Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tientsin. It is planned that starting tomorrow, train service will be restored to Tangshan first. Japanese military police will be temporarily responsible for protection along the way. The first train to run will be a reconnaissance train with armed police to inspect the tracks and bridges along the way, so that repairs can be made as needed. The passenger and freight train services will be delayed for a day or two. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The people of six counties east of Peiping, including Ji County, Bao Di, Yutian, Zunhua, Sanhe, and Pinggu, oppose the incorporation of puppet troops into the police force and have jointly submitted petitions to both the military and political councils, requesting the withdrawal of the proposed plan. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) The Japanese attitude has changed again. The traffic service train to Tangshan, scheduled to depart on the 2nd, may not be realized. (Special Dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) The section of the Peining Railway between Tangshan and Yuguan is controlled by puppet troops, preventing train service. Outsiders are fully aware that this is being manipulated by the Japanese in secret and are deeply dissatisfied. Last month, American soldiers traveling to Qinhuangdao were stopped at Tianzhuang, leading to complaints to the Japanese side. Recently, the Italian troops stationed in Tientsin plan to go to the vicinity of Beidaihe for summer training and have negotiated with both China and Japan to run a train for transportation. Therefore, the Japanese side expressed to the Railway Bureau its willingness to assist in restoring train service on the Tangshan-Yuguan section. Director Qian Zongze visited Nakamura at the Japanese military headquarters in Tientsin at 10:00 AM on the 1st to discuss specific methods for opening the train service. After an hour of secret talks, it was decided that a traffic service train would depart for Tangshan on the 2nd, escorted by Japanese soldiers. However, due to sovereignty issues, our side will also send 20 railway police officers to escort the train. This train will not sell tickets and will only have Mr. Si Tili, the director of the Transportation Department, leading mechanics to repair the damaged road signs and raise flags, and then the passenger and freight train services between Peiping and Tangshan will begin. The next step is to restore train service between Tangshan and Yuguan, which can be resolved at the same time as the puppet troop issue. (Special Dispatch on the 1st) (Peiping) After the War Zone Receiving Committee was established in Tientsin on the 1st, detailed decisions were made regarding the takeover procedures. Tao Shangming and some members of the committee returned to Peiping on the evening of the 1st to report to the authorities. However, it is still impossible to discuss when the Japanese troops on the Great Wall lines will be completely withdrawn and when our side can take over the war zone. The withdrawal of Japanese troops can only be carried out as a settlement according to what is stated in the armistice agreement, and there is no possibility of a complete withdrawal. But how to withdraw and how to take over will depend on the results of the Dalian conference. Our organization of the Receiving Committee is a preparation in advance. It is heard that Xue Zhiheng, Yin Tong, Lei Shourong, and others arrived in Dalian on the evening of the 1st. Japanese representative Kita and Li Jichun, Kan Duo, and others arrived in Dalian earlier. The first meeting was held on the evening of the 1st. It is planned to raise the issues of the handling of war zone supplies, puppet troops, and the Peining Railway traffic service for negotiation on the 2nd, with the aim of creating a concrete plan for the aforementioned issues after discussion, with each party responsible for implementation. Both the Japanese and puppet sides have expressed considerable sincerity, but it is difficult to predict at this time whether a satisfactory result can be achieved. However, the main key to the two matters of receiving the war zone and the Peining Railway traffic service lies in whether the puppet troop issue can be resolved smoothly. Because the puppet troops in various places in eastern Hebei have been fostered by the Japanese side from the beginning, and they have been expanding daily recently. The internal affairs of the puppet troops are also extremely complex, and there are many different factions, but the power is in the hands of the Japanese side, so they all shift based on the Japanese attitude. If the Japanese side is responsible for assisting in resolving the issue, the puppet troops will have no choice but to submit. If the puppet troop issue is resolved, the Peining Railway traffic will naturally progress accordingly; otherwise, nothing can be realized. Therefore, the Dalian conference is an important conference following the armistice negotiations. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>Zhao Bulian Received Central Government's Order to Enter Shanxi</p>
<p>Feng Firmly States He Does Not Wish to Leave</p>
<p>Sun Liangcheng Received Feng's Order to Take Command of the Advance Army</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the Chahar situation, Yan is planning to mediate with Feng. How he will mediate is still unclear. Wang Faqin has arrived in Peiping from Nanjing, preparing to go to Zhangjiakou to work for peace. Kong Xiangxi telegraphed Peiping today, stating that he is still preparing to go north in the short term, first to Peiping to meet with He and Huang, and then to Shanxi. If a result is obtained, he will personally visit Feng in Zhangjiakou to work on communication, proceeding according to the Central Government's established policy. If Feng's intentions are firm, he will seek other appropriate ways to resolve the Chahar issue as soon as possible. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) There is no hope for a peaceful resolution of the Chahar issue in the short term. The Peiping authorities have proposed two methods, but in fact, it is feared that a satisfactory response will be difficult to obtain. Li Qi telegraphed Peiping, stating that regardless of whether negotiations in Zhangjiakou yield results, he will definitely return to Peiping within days to report to all parties. In addition to proceeding according to the original plan, the Peiping authorities are also awaiting instructions from the Central Government. Kong Xiangxi will only come north after the Central Government confirms a peaceful resolution method. Song Zheyuan's attitude remains lukewarm, stating that he will listen to all orders from the Central Government. Zhao Pilian arrived in Peiping tonight. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Feng Yuxiang's representative, Li Qi, again telephoned Song Zheyuan yesterday, stating that he will come to Peiping from Zhangjiakou the day after tomorrow to report Feng's opinions to Song. It is heard that Feng has no concrete expression, and the Chahar issue is feared to remain in a deadlock. Deng Zhexi went to Tientsin yesterday. Feng's former subordinates Pang Bingxun and Xiong Bin, etc., are currently working to mediate, to avoid further complications. The Central Government plans for Kong Xiangxi to meet with Yan before making a decision. Kong was originally scheduled to go north early to meet with the military and political authorities in Peiping, and then visit Yan in Taiyuan, asking Yan to make a final mediation on the Chahar issue. However, he was unable to depart immediately due to an issue. The Central Government also sent Zhao Pilian north to meet with Yan to discuss everything. Zhao arrived in Tientsin this morning and is scheduled to come to Peiping tonight or tomorrow morning, and then transfer to Taiyuan to meet with Yan. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd) (Peiping) Feng Yuxiang's intentions are still firm, stating that he will neither come east nor go west. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A person from Zhangjiakou said that Feng Yuxiang appointed Sun Liangcheng as the commander-in-chief of the Advance Army. Sun has taken office and is now establishing the General Headquarters at Shangbu Shagang, actively training new soldiers. Many new soldiers recruited from the stations along the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway have been sent to Zhangjiakou, all under Sun's command. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Industry sources say that the Japanese Mitsui Trading Company is now preparing to regain momentum and serve as the center of Japan's economic aggression against China. More than 20 Japanese ships in China are scheduled to resume service in September. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Support Embankment of Danshuichi in Hankou Has Turned From Danger to Safety <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) The support embankment of Danshuichi in Hankou suddenly collapsed on the morning of the 2nd due to strong winds and rising waters, causing the river water to flow back. Wu Guozhen directed the rescue efforts at the embankment, and it was finally blocked well. It has now turned from danger to safety. The streets and markets along the river in Hanyang have not retreated the water, and started draining on the 2nd. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e6">There Is Still No Trace of the Haiqi and Other Three Warships <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>One Says They Seem to Have Gone to Guangdong, Another Says They Should Not Be Far Away</p>
<p>Han Fuju Proposed Methods for Appeasement</p>
<p>(Jinan) Ge Guangting and Zhang Yue, representatives of Han Fuju, arrived in Jinan from Qingdao. Ge said that the three warships have not communicated with Qingdao for three days. According to previous radio wave measurements, they are about 1,000 miles away from Qingdao. The warships have not been found and must have gone to Guangdong, because the captain of the warship who plotted to harm Shen Zhifang last year is now the commander of the Guangdong fortress. Most of the officers of this mutiny are Shen's students, so they first opened north to Shidao to avoid pursuit. Shen has now decided not to resign and will continue to be responsible. I am here to report to Han on behalf of Shen. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The National Lawyers Association telegraphed its representatives in this city, asking them to persuade Shen Honglie to stay. Various industry unions in this city telegraphed Nanjing and Peiping on the 2nd, earnestly requesting that Shen not be allowed to resign. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding Qinghai military affairs, Han Fuju telegraphed the Haiqi and other three warships, proposing two methods: 1. If the officers on the ships want to go abroad, Han said he would send them to study. 2. If the warships are returned, their positions can be preserved. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Since the Haiqi, Zhaohua, Haishen and other three warships acted on their own, there has been no news as of the 2nd. It is not known where they are anchored. The Qingdao radio station has repeatedly sent telegrams to inquire, but the warships have not responded. Shen Honglie's representative, Bao Yimin, is scheduled to return to Qingdao on the 3rd. According to related sources, the initiator of this incident was a Mr. Guan, not Feng Zhichong, because Mr. Guan was also the leader when Shen Honglie was trapped in the Laoshan conference last year. After the incident, the captains of the Zhaohua and other three warships were driven off the ships by Mr. Guan. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the Haiqi and other three warships left Shidao, they were on the Shandong coastal waters. Last night, it was rumored that they had arrived outside Dagu port. The Peiping authorities reported that it was still difficult to confirm based on naval sources. Some sources said that the coal carried by the three warships was very little and they could not sail far, so they seemed to still be in the Shandong coastal area. The junior officers on board who mutinied were afraid of being subject to military law if they landed, so they did not dare to sail into the harbor. Yao Daohong, the naval representative stationed in Peiping, reported the incident to the military branch council this morning with Bao Yimin. The reason was that the navy's pay was in arrears greatly. He has ordered that 60,000 yuan be allocated from Peiping immediately and remitted to Qingdao. It is rumored that Ling Xiao was on the Haiqi warship. It has been verified that Ling is still in Peiping recently, residing in a friend's home. He did not participate in this naval incident.

<p>Liu Wenhui Adopts an Offensive Strategy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain agency received a telegram from Chongqing on the 2nd, stating that Liu Xiang has finalized the entire plan for suppressing the Communists in Sichuan and has decided to use force to stop the prolonged internal strife. He left Chongqing on the 30th for Longchang to supervise the military, with officers from the 21st Army Zhang Biguo, Li Hongkun, the Tian Army Yu Anmin, the Yang Army Yu Mengqun, the Deng Army Zhao Juxu, and the Liu Cunhou Army Shu Yunqu accompanying him as military advisors. Another telegram said that the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce and various groups initiated a "Promote the Suppression of Communists and Stabilize Sichuan Association," requesting Liu Xiang to join the generals of various armies and immediately send troops to fully stop the Sichuan war and eliminate the Red bandits to stabilize Sichuan and stabilize the people's hearts. Another telegram said that Liu Wenhui convened a generals' meeting on armed mediation troops and decided to adopt an offensive strategy, launching a fierce attack on the 21st Army first. The 8th Brigade stationed in Jia of the * * * Department crossed the Min River on the 26th and was distributed in the area of ​​He Erkan and Matajing. Zhang Zhifang's Department Huang Regiment also moved from Niuhuaxi to the area of ​​Wangcun Jingshan Temple. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deng Xihou telegraphed Chairman Lin of the Central Government, Chairman Chiang, and President Wang, saying that Liu Wenhui has provoked hostilities without cause, besieging the city on the basis of the land. For more than a month, the deaths of the people and the casualties of officers and soldiers have been countless. Xihou has repeatedly telegraphed appeals and exhausted his strength and voice. The Central Government has investigated his treachery and telegraphed him to cease fighting and return to defense, which is no less than three orders and five applications. But he has a tendency to disturb the peace and is determined to resist the order. He has neither returned to defense nor stopped fighting. In recent days, it was found that he was transporting soldiers and collecting various materials for crossing the river to launch a major offensive. As a result, on the afternoon of the 25th, he launched a general offensive against our riverfront, gathering machine guns and artillery to cover most of them, attacking and crossing the Doucha Weir. They have landed on our shore. After our defending soldiers fought bravely and fought for several hours, the troops were repelled. This morning, he continued to attack us. At this time, Tongjiang and Chongling have been captured by bandits again, and Bazhong and Guangyuan have been lost one after another. The Red bandits are so rampant. How can we continue to fight internally? Wenhui has been using soldiers endlessly. What is his intention? Xihou can only beg the Central Government to strictly order Wenhui to cease fighting and return to defense, and order the * Commissioner Xiang to use armed force to stop the war, and at the same time prepare a plan for suppressing the bandits, withdraw various parts of the Sichuan army, and cooperate in suppressing the Red bandits to save the dangerous situation. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) While actively preparing for war, Liu Wenhui telegraphed the government and Chiang Kai-shek, expressing his unwillingness to fight and preventing the Red Flame from taking the opportunity to expand, and requested that Liu Xiang be ordered to stop military actions and cooperate with various armies to suppress the Red bandits, and requested the Central Government to formulate methods for eliminating the Red bandits as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e9">The Truth About the Xinjiang Coup <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Gong Bicheng Receives the Press</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gong Bicheng received the press and reported on the truth of the new changes: 1. During Jin Shuren's tenure, the people suffered severely. The reason why the provincial army could not quell the Muslim rebellion in the past was that it was prevented by Jin Shuren. When the Revolutionary Army marched north, the people of Xinjiang Province did their best to assist the Central Government, which proves that the people of Xinjiang Province obey the Central Government. 2. The people of Xinjiang are ethnically diverse and know little about politics. Now, to seek equality in political power for all ethnic groups, the Xinjiang Provincial Government must be reorganized. The people of Xinjiang Province unanimously support the establishment of a temporary committee to maintain the Xinjiang Provincial Government to handle Xinjiang's aftermath, finance, and diplomacy. 3. Over the past few decades, local undertakings in Xinjiang Province have gradually been enlightened.

<p>Seamen Escaping the Danger Recount the Tragic Incident</p>
<p>(Dalian) Two more escaped criminals from the Sheng An tragedy were arrested at 8:00 PM tonight. One is Gao Ziqi, a Swiss national, and the other is Miller, a German national. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The remaining two escaped criminals from the Sheng An tragedy are still being actively pursued. The 58 Chinese seamen and coolies on the ship, after a night of peaceful sleep, have calmed their frightened spirits. One of them told a Reuters reporter today that the Sheng An ran aground on a reef 100 yards from Xingpu due to the thieves' careless navigation. At that time, he knew salvation had arrived, and he was extremely happy. He then recounted the entire story of the thieves' atrocities, saying that on June 25th, five foreigners requested the captain at Tangzhan to allow them to travel to Shanghai. Around 10:00 PM on the 28th, about 200 miles from Shanghai, the five men were stationed at key points on the ship. One of them suddenly opened fire, killing the Chinese radio operator and destroying the radio equipment. The first mate, Hosi Nanov, heard the gunfire and rushed to the deck, but bullets rained down on him, and he died instantly. Mr. Hosina's wife was chatting with Captain Wickman in the cabin when the thieves fired wildly through the window, killing both of them. Before the incident, Mrs. Ho had summoned the captain's Chinese servant. When the Chinese servant and another Chinese servant arrived, they were also killed by the thieves. Three Russians and three Chinese all died violently within seconds. The thieves then killed three Chinese seamen on the deck and two others who were sleeping soundly. Because the shots were so close, the heads of these two were almost blown off. The thieves then tied up the bodies with ropes and threw them into the sea. The three thieves who have been arrested now give the same account as above, and they also said that Captain Wickman was a burly man, making it very difficult to throw his body into the sea. Most of the other seamen were gambling at mahjong in the lower deck. Hearing the alarm, they turned pale and hid in a small room, tightly closing the door. There was no food or water in the room, and breathing was difficult, but everyone preferred to suffocate in the room rather than go outside. It was not until the ship ran aground that they saw the light of day again. Those seamen who did not have time to escape all suffered cruel treatment. The thieves ordered the ship to turn back towards Dalian. The thieves must have been to the port before. The thieves then ordered the words "Sheng An" to be painted over with lacquer and renamed "Hua Li." The two words "Hua Li" are still clearly visible today. The Sheng An ran aground at 3:00 AM on July 1st. All the seamen on the ship were then imprisoned. Four thieves first went ashore in two sampans. Westerman (initially reported as Weston) and Signa were arrested in a house, where they were sleeping with guns under their pillows. The leader, Daoding, left the ship a little later and was arrested when he landed. This was because the police, seeing the Sheng An, suspected it was a ship smuggling sugar and had gathered on the beach to investigate. Although the three thieves all carried German passports when they were arrested, they all claimed to be American citizens. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs took this opportunity to study how to handle this issue. It was decided that in the future, within the scope of the consulate's examination authority, inland restrictions would be established. The consul-general stationed in the country must conduct a detailed investigation of the identity, ideology, and actions of those applying for passports and report to the ambassador and the ministry in the country where they are stationed.

<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu spoke to reporters on the 2nd about the pros and cons of cotton and wheat loans as follows: ㈠ American cotton has long fibers and is clean, making it popular with yarn factories. However, American cotton costs about 60 yuan per dan in Chinese currency, while Chinese cotton costs only 46 yuan, which is cheaper. Yarn factories demand to buy at an 80% discount and be exempt from import duties. According to the cotton loan of 40 million US dollars, 900,000 bales can be purchased, which is similar to the amount of cotton imported by customs last year. If foreign cotton is no longer imported in the future, it seems to have little adverse impact on Chinese merchants. ㈡ The government issues bonds at about a 60% discount, while cotton loans are sold at an 80% discount, which is still a good deal. However, tariff exemptions are absolutely not allowed because central tax revenue will decrease, and Chinese cotton will also lose its protection. ㈢ The last time American wheat was borrowed, due to inconvenient transportation in the provinces along the Yangtze River, the relief wheat was sold in Shanghai, which made Shanghai wheat cheaper and the price of wheat in disaster areas higher. This time, the disaster areas are far away in Shaanxi and Gansu, and the transportation of relief grain is even more difficult. It is feared that the same mistake will be repeated, which is worrying. ㈣ The repayment period is too short. If exports are not increased or imports are not reduced, the exchange rate will inevitably plummet due to the excessive need for foreign exchange, and the losses will be great. Therefore, the use of loans should be limited to productive enterprises to avoid this problem. ㈤ In recent years, the Shanghai silver industry has found it difficult to issue loans, and investing in yarn factories is the only way out. Now that this road is closed, idle funds may flow into speculation, and social economy will increase several times. Losses should be paid attention to. ㈥ Farmers should improve their knowledge and not be greedy for small profits and mix impurities and water into Chinese cotton, causing them to lose the welcome of yarn factories, so that they can resist foreign cotton.

Now it plans to establish a large-scale electrical machinery manufacturing plant, named the Central Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant, with a capital of four million yuan.

<h3 id="e63">Another Difficulty for the World Economic Conference Ming <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The World Economic Conference has been in session for three weeks since it officially opened on June 12. The biggest obstacle currently facing it is the war debt problem. Not only can it not be resolved satisfactorily, but it is also afraid to be mentioned openly. Although the British Prime Minister clearly stated in his opening remarks that the world economy would be difficult to recover if war debts were not resolved, there was no proper solution after the United States expressed its refusal. In order to maintain its credibility and leave room for future maneuvering, Britain had to pay a portion of the war debts due, but this was enough to cause agitation among European countries. Moreover, nationalism is now prevalent. Although it has been fully proven theoretically and practically that international cooperation is necessary for the world economy to recover, and that the widespread economic panic has no end, all countries in the world are confused by their own immediate interests and are unwilling to sacrifice for mutual benefit. Since this main issue is of different interests, and from war debts down, the so-called currency problem, tariff problem, and market development problem are all "self-righteous" and lack sincerity in cooperation. This is why, after three weeks of the conference, it is still impossible to find a ray of hope for cooperation.</p>
<p>The general opinion is that this war debt problem should be temporarily set aside because it conflicts too much, and the secondary currency stability problem should be solved first. If a stable international currency method can be found, then international trade may reach a balanced state, and economic panic may be slightly reduced. The ruined market can also be revitalized by this. It is also not the beginning of no plan, but since the financial panic in the United States, it has stopped the gold standard and has to adopt a policy of currency inflation to stimulate prices. As a result of the implementation of this policy, first, the European gold standard countries feel the threat of a large influx of American goods and cash outflow. Second, the domestic market in the United States will be completely filled with its own manufactured goods, and goods from other countries cannot be imported. As a result, Europe and the United States are opposed to each other, and the conflict between France and the United States cannot be reconciled, and other countries cannot be relieved. The so-called currency stability is not only a competition between the gold standard and the non-gold standard. Even countries that have abandoned the gold standard cannot but be wary of the American inflation policy.</p>
<p>The European countries led by France, in terms of political relations, Germany has formed another group, but economically, it still cannot be separated from France. The Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries are even less likely to be separated. From our observation, the reasons why France maintains the gold standard system are: first, to maintain its absolute leadership position in the European financial community. France's cash reserves exceed 3.2 billion US dollars. Although it is dead in the vault, it has been valued by European countries. Since the United States abandoned the gold standard, France's position in Europe will increase. Second, if the currency parity is reduced, it will be beneficial to Britain, and after excessive inflation, France, with its inferior industry, will find it difficult to restrict the large-scale import of foreign manufactured goods. Therefore, the so-called stability of currency is to prevent excessive inflation policy, and it is also to maintain France's advantage.</p>
<p>The reason why the United States has reversed the previous Republican Party's actions and adopted a policy of currency inflation, focusing solely on the interests of industrial capital, is that it has already learned that the freezing of war debts is inevitable. In this time of industrial decline and agricultural recession, it is difficult to maintain the prosperity of its domestic market by relying solely on gold profits. Therefore, the current coping policy is to reduce the value of currency and increase prices through currency inflation in order to restore the market. The meaning of this is about two points. One is to stimulate general consumption power and encourage its foreign exports. Second, American products have not been able to keep pace with Japan in overseas markets due to the high value of the US dollar, and are even lagging behind Britain. Therefore, it has to depreciate its currency to make American goods re-enter the stage of commodity competition in order to transform the decline of its economic panic.</p>
<p>As for Britain and Japan, they have long abandoned the gold standard, and their currencies now have relative stability. Therefore, in the competition for currency stability between France and the United States, they pretend to be neutral. In fact, no matter what the future trend is, they can all obtain some benefits. In short, the principle of "currency stability" will not be fully implemented even if the United States accepts it. Moreover, the prices of the international market are especially not resolved by the formal agreement on the conference table. Therefore, even if the current difficulty of the economic conference can be overcome, there are still many future disasters. The optimistic component is particularly scarce.</p>
<p>The fate of the World Economic Conference is decided today</p>
<h3 id="e64">Roosevelt Rejects Currency Stabilization Plan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Hull to Explain U.S. Policy Today</p>
<p>Further Revisions Sought to European Proposal</p>
<p>French Delegation Sees Hope for Compromise</p>
<p>(London) U.S. President Roosevelt has rejected the European proposal for central bank cooperation to stabilize currencies but has left room for further negotiations, claiming he opposes the existing form of the plan. With Roosevelt's statement and Secretary of State Hull's announcement that he will elaborate on U.S. monetary policy at the economic conference on Monday, the initial disappointment at the rejection has been somewhat mitigated.</p>
<p>Undersecretary of State Moley, in preparation for the U.S. delegation's statement, will meet with leaders of major European delegations. French Finance Minister Bonnet has returned to Paris but is expected back in London on Monday to hear the U.S. delegation's statement and participate in possible negotiations.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull has not yet indicated the nature of the U.S. delegation's statement. Many representatives of gold standard countries believe that the U.S. will declare its desire to achieve absolute monetary equality in foreign trade, as countries that have devalued their currencies have gained valuable trade advantages for the past two years. Therefore, the U.S. President does not want to participate in strict stabilization efforts until the U.S. obtains equal benefits. However, Hull is expected to endorse a plan to stop speculative surges and declines.</p>
<p>While the French delegation assures that gold standard countries will adhere to their original proposal, it also believes there is still hope for compromise. A French delegate stated that President Roosevelt's rejection is not surprising, but if the U.S. insists on major modifications, the new plan may be of little benefit, as the current plan is already as moderate as possible. The original proposal of the gold standard countries has been repeatedly modified at the request of the British, and he does not know how much more can be modified at this point.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Original Proposal Has Been Published, Part of Which Is as Follows <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>"Joint Declaration of Gold Standard and Non-Gold Standard Countries: It is hereby agreed that the international currency market should be stabilized as soon as practicable and to the greatest extent possible, and that this is in the common interest of all countries concerned. It is also agreed that the re-establishment of gold as the basis for calculating international exchange rates should be completed within the time deemed necessary by countries that have abandoned the gold standard to stabilize their currencies. The exchange rates with other currencies must be determined by the respective governments. The gold standard countries reiterate their knowledge of the current gold parity and the monetary laws of their respective countries, maintain the free use of the gold standard, and believe that maintaining the current gold parity is beneficial to the world's recovery. The countries that have abandoned the gold standard and are participating in this declaration will pay attention to the aforementioned declaration and acknowledge its importance, but this declaration does not prevent their future currency parity with gold, and they will reiterate that the ultimate goal of their monetary policy is to restore an international standard based on gold under appropriate conditions. The governments that have abandoned the gold standard agree to adopt the most effective measures to restrict exchange speculation. Other signatory countries will cooperate for the same purpose. The signatory governments agree to have their central banks cooperate with the central banks of other countries that have signed this declaration to limit speculation and, at the appropriate time, to rebuild an international gold standard."</p>

<p>It is now expected that Hull will explain on Monday which parts of this draft declaration are not satisfactory to the U.S. Yesterday, the U.S. President stated at his summer retreat that he saw no reason to oppose central banks stopping speculation, so it is expected that he will agree on this point.</p>
<p>As for the gold standard countries, although they will insist on their position, it is said that they will not issue a declaration until Bonnet returns to England, and they will likely study the U.S. statement of policy before issuing a declaration. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Will Depend on Hull's Speech Today</p>
<p>(New York) Washington dispatches on President Roosevelt's rejection of the currency stabilization proposal are varied. Some say it is a direct resistance to France, while others say that the President's move is only intended to delay the final decision for a few days so that the dollar can fall to a sufficiently low level to join a private control plan. President Roosevelt's statement that stabilizing currency prices is a banking matter, not a government one, has eliminated hope for stabilizing currency prices unless the Federal Reserve is protected by the U.S. Treasury from losses. The U.S. President believes that permanent stability is hopeless until the gold standard countries have shown their ability to maintain the gold standard. Furthermore, the vague wording of the economic conference's proposals is another reason for the U.S. rejection. The speech of U.S. Chief Delegate Hull on Monday may determine the fate of the conference. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>French Newspaper Says the End of the Conference Is Near</p>
<p>(London) Major representatives attending the World Economic Conference, such as Bonnet of France and Colijn of the Netherlands, have mostly returned to their countries. Therefore, the conference has a desolate and quiet atmosphere this morning. Representatives of gold standard countries met this morning but no concrete measures were heard. Representatives from various countries seemed unwilling to openly and practically discuss the issue of adjourning the conference, as they had to wait for the speech of U.S. Chief Delegate Hull on Monday before taking any action. Some sources said that Washington may have suggestions for revising the joint declaration. The only direct criticism of the situation from the gold standard countries this morning came from Dr. Trip, President of the Dutch Bank, who is acting as the chief Dutch delegate during Colijn's absence. It is reported that although President Roosevelt does not agree, the Dutch representatives will continue their gold policy, not only not abandoning it, but also cooperating with other gold standard countries to maintain it. The gold standard countries are deeply aware of the importance of their policy to prevent currency disorder. When asked if the Netherlands was prepared to propose an adjournment, Dr. Trip replied that no rational person could express an opinion on this matter at present. When interviewed by Reuters today, Chinese representative Dr. Yan Huiqing was pessimistic about the situation, saying that in his opinion, from China's standpoint, the gold issue is of utmost importance. If this issue is not resolved, the silver issue cannot be resolved either. French newspapers welcomed the imminent end of the conference with pessimistic remarks. Le Journal Écho de Paris said that the economic conference no longer has a reason to exist. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>While Trying to Win Over Britain</p>
<p>Britain Does Not Believe the Conference Will Break Down</p>
<p>(London) Representatives from various countries in London have reported the news of the U.S. President's rejection of the currency stabilization proposal to their respective governments. It is heard that the American side here believes that the proposal must be redrafted before the U.S. President can accept it. President Roosevelt telegraphed the U.S. delegation in London last night, without mentioning any agreement on central bank cooperation. The U.S. President believes that there can be no permanent stability until all countries are on a permanent monetary basis. There is a serious movement in France advocating adjournment of the conference, unwilling to continue empty talk that only benefits market speculation. It is heard that French Prime Minister Daladier holds this view. According to French sources, Professor Moley, who recently arrived in England from the U.S. representing the U.S. President, clearly warned the U.S. President that if the U.S. does not join the joint declaration on stabilizing currency prices, it will result in the adjournment of the conference. Opposition newspapers pointed out that President Roosevelt is very similar to Robinson Crusoe living alone on a desert island. British officials are unwilling to criticize the U.S. President's attitude but do not acknowledge the claim that the economic conference is about to break down. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The French side at the World Economic Conference stated that even if President Roosevelt does not approve of any form of joint declaration, France does not want to withdraw from the conference. However, France's belief that the conference can achieve important achievements will be completely destroyed. The French believe that the future of the conference lies with Britain. If the U.S. President is unwilling to issue a joint declaration, then Britain should make closer contact with the European bloc. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(New York) The general public in the U.S. believes that if currency stabilization cannot be achieved quickly, the Netherlands will abandon the gold standard after eight days, and Switzerland, Belgium, and France will follow suit in the short term. (Havas, 1st) (London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said in a speech at a Conservative Party meeting that it may be difficult to achieve uniform currency stabilization among countries at present, and that current currency speculation, which causes prices to fluctuate erratically, only increases the difficulty.

Gold standard countries should cooperate with each other to resist Britain and the U.S. Germany, although without gold, is determined not to abandon the gold standard. Schacht also criticized the World Economic Conference for not addressing debt issues. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Stock Prices Rise by Three Pounds Sterling</p>
<p>(New York) New York stock prices rose again this morning by one to three pounds sterling, due to the excitement caused by hearing President Roosevelt's statement that the dollar exchange rate has not fallen to a sufficiently low level. Although there was news that central banks of various countries would conclude an agreement for international efforts, trading remained high as the dollar fell. Business Weekly published an editorial entitled "The Spectacle of Inflation Business Based Solely on Confidence," stating that the U.S. government has not implemented a true inflation policy, that the currency in circulation has decreased by 180 million yuan since March, that bank lending to the industrial sector has not expanded, and that the Federal Reserve Bank has not exercised its temporary contingency power to inject government debt into banks.

<p>Sydney The Australian Federal Prime Ministers met in secret today to discuss the issue of reducing wheat fields and have reportedly agreed on a satisfactory solution.

It is reported that those in charge said that the Federal Prime Ministers have agreed to the restriction of wheat exports. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) There is indeed hope for an agreement on the wheat issue at the World Economic Conference today. The Australian representatives received a telegram from the Australian government containing the resolutions of the Federal Prime Ministers' meeting and the Australian government's instructions. It is said that the main issues of finance and economics should be resolved first, followed by wheat and other matters. However, Australia acknowledges in principle the temporary measures for restricting wheat exports, provided that Australian interests are not discriminated against and that European wheat producers also cooperate effectively in this plan. The Federal Prime Ministers agreed on a principle that, in view of the world's existing surplus, Australia should not store more wheat than its usual needs in the next two years. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>To Implement Currency Stabilization Slowly</p>
<p>To Wait for Prices to Gradually Increase</p>
<p>(Washington) Roosevelt sent banker Baruch to England as his liaison with the U.S. delegation to the economic conference. Baruch plans to depart eastward on July 15, directly to France. Baruch claims that his trip has nothing to do with the London conference, but he may consult with leaders of the U.S. delegation in Europe. Roosevelt, aboard the cruiser "Indianapolis," will arrive at Annapolis and has telegraphed various ministers and senior government officials to go there on Monday to discuss currency stabilization and other issues. Roosevelt is scheduled to return to Washington on Tuesday. All plans to inspect naval bases in Guantanamo, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Panama Canal defense works will be postponed. Roosevelt's reason for rejecting the European currency stabilization plan is actually due to concerns about the views of the inflation faction, which occupies a majority in Congress. This faction wants Roosevelt to use the currency inflation privileges granted by Congress to raise prices, at least to the level of 1926. The general public mostly agrees with stabilizing the dollar at 70 cents, but they fear that it will hinder the price policy, so they do not want to make a hasty decision. Some quarters are encouraging Roosevelt to seek to have all countries abandon the gold standard, and then stabilize currencies based on the actual status of each country and according to the needs of international commerce. In short, Roosevelt's opinions are also inconsistent, but they all believe that the U.S. has not abandoned the currency stabilization plan, but will implement it slowly. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Sino-Soviet-Manchu meeting on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is scheduled to hold its third meeting at 3 p.m. tomorrow. During the four-day adjournment, the feelings between the two sides have not yet become closer. The Japanese Navy Ministry is vigorously brewing anti-Soviet sentiment under the theme of forced fishing and tragic fishermen incidents. The Army Ministry believes that the real power is already in the hands of the Kwantung Army and that the sale is only to deceive the world, so there is no need to spend more money on the purchase. Major General Itagaki, a pseudo-state advisor, has returned to Tokyo under secret orders from the Kwantung Army to carry out various anti-Soviet conspiracies. It is heard that the opinions and feelings of the two sides at tomorrow's meeting will still be diametrically opposed. (Hua Lian, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e77">Stockpiles Accumulate at Suifenhe Station, Foreign Merchants Have Protested <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Since the railway agreement was broken again and the through transport between the Chinese Eastern and Ussuri Railways was cut off, the goods stockpiled at Suifenhe Station have become very considerable. This delay in cargo transportation at Suifenhe Station has caused protests from foreign companies, as they have suffered significant losses due to this delay. The Manchurian authorities are trying to place the responsibility for this matter on the Soviet representatives, saying that they refuse to establish a transit business for import and export goods via Suifenhe Station. However, merchants exporting goods to foreign countries have separately stated to their consuls that the transshipment takes too long and requires the construction of a dedicated platform and other buildings and equipment for this purpose. Therefore, the "Manchu State" authorities' proposal has not eliminated the difficulties they created, and it is sufficient to show that through transport between the two railways is particularly necessary. They requested that the above opinions be forwarded to Li Shaogeng, Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (TASS, 1st)</p>
<p>(Changchun) It is reliably heard that on the 24th, Russian Consul Mikhailov in Heihe replied to the request of the Manchurian Consul stationed in Blagoveshchensk for convening a waterway conference, stating that the Soviet Russian government hopes to revise the 1922 waterway agreement. They have received government instructions and are currently preparing. The negotiation location is hoped to be in Heihe, and the Soviet Russian Consul in Heihe will be appointed as the Russian negotiator. They hope to have a cordial agreement on the discussion of this agreement. (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e78">U.S. New Foreign Policy <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) According to those familiar with U.S. political affairs, the U.S.'s new foreign policy can be summarized as follows: ㈠ The U.S. believes that the disarmament conference will eventually fail, so it has decided to abandon its wait-and-see attitude and focus on consolidating its national defense. It will soon begin a three-year naval construction plan, building 32 warships and 290 aircraft, while establishing four naval bases, two each on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. ㈡ The U.S. has suggested to Europe that it establish a consultation treaty to guarantee peace, but Europe has not followed the U.S.'s lead. The U.S. is now preparing to notify European countries that if they do not listen to the U.S., the U.S. will let them be and will no longer interfere in European affairs. ㈢ Regarding the international economic conference, the U.S. focuses first on ensuring the happiness of the American people. This is true for tariffs and currency issues, as well as for war debts. Therefore, the U.S. will reject debt countries' requests for concessions that would increase the burden on U.S. taxpayers. U.S. political circles acknowledge that this new foreign policy trend is absolutely contradictory to the principles announced by the Roosevelt government in recent months and believe that this new policy will cause a reversal in the entire world politics.

<p>Russia, Poland, Turkey, and Others Sign Security Pact</p>
<p>May Be Signed in London Today</p>
<p>To Be Expanded into a Nine-Nation Pact</p>
<p>(London) It has just been learned that the four countries of Soviet Russia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey have completely agreed today to sign a four-nation security pact, and the initial letters will likely be signed here on Monday. It is said that this pact is expected to expand to nine countries soon. Representatives from Russia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey have invited Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia to join, stating that they firmly believe that the five countries will also join, sweeping away the suspicions of Eastern Europe. (National Telegram, July 1)</p>
<p>Rome The issue of the organization of small Central European countries is now being commented on by the Italian press. French newspapers have advocated that Italy and the Little Entente countries sign treaties separately to resolve the Danube issue. Italy believes that establishing an alliance with Yugoslavia is very obstructive because "Yugoslavia harbors resentment against Italy and is constantly engaging in propaganda attacks." Italian newspapers also said, "It is not yet time to establish this kind of alliance. Italy knows how to choose a better alliance and must base it on factual evidence before establishing it." Il Popolo d'Italia said, "Hungary and Austria can be independent and prosperous, but on one condition: that they do not lose contact with their friendly neighboring countries, such as Germany, Italy, and the major Western powers. Hungary and Austria should unite with Italy and Germany to form a prosperous and wealthy center of continental Europe." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to London news, the Soviet Russian government is now planning to conclude multilateral non-aggression treaties with the Little Entente countries, the Baltic countries, Persia, Afghanistan, and other countries. This news has attracted the attention of the general public here. It is heard that Moscow has notified the German government of the progress of the negotiations. Political circles here regard this move by Soviet Russia as aiming to consolidate its position in Europe and the Near East. According to recent news, this treaty is not a true non-aggression pact, but merely a statement of the contracting countries' desire for peace and a definition of the meaning of "aggressor." Although this treaty can ease the tense situation between Soviet Russia and its neighboring countries, especially Poland and Romania, it does not have much legal significance, and the Soviet Russian government may not be able to clearly abandon its claim to Bessarabia. However, all parties will regard this treaty as containing the practical recognition of existing borders. According to Diplomatisch-Politische Korrespondenz, the German-Russian relationship based on the recent continued Berlin Treaty will not be affected by this new treaty, and it is hoped that the new treaty will continue to clarify the general political atmosphere.

<p>Moley Tells Litvinov in London of the U.S. Attitude on Recognition of Soviet Russia</p>
<p>(London) It has just been learned that U.S. Undersecretary of State Moley has met with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, but both want to keep this secret, probably because Moley has not been authorized to speak on behalf of the U.S. President. According to a certain U.S. representative, all trade and diplomatic issues were discussed in detail. Moley told Litvinov of his personal knowledge of the U.S. attitude towards recognizing Soviet Russia, but stated that it was not an official statement, but only listed what he personally considered the U.S. government would require before full resumption of relations. It is heard that Moley said that he personally did not oppose full resumption of relations. Since Moley is deeply trusted by the U.S. President, this statement is sufficient to increase Litvinov's hope for early official negotiations. In addition, it is heard that trade matters were discussed at length. According to sources in the U.S. delegation, this is the second time that people have spoken with Litvinov.

<p>(London) The British Foreign Office issued a statement stating that the Russian Embassy has notified Foreign Secretary Simon that Thornton and MacDonald, who were sentenced to three and two years of imprisonment, respectively, in April of this year, have petitioned the government to pardon their crimes. This request was approved today by the Presidium of the Soviet Russian Executive Committee, so these two can leave Russia immediately. It is found that these two will be released tonight, and at the same time, the Soviet Russian Trade Commissar has canceled the order prohibiting the import of British goods, and the British Emperor has also issued an order today, canceling the prohibition order issued on April 19 based on the prohibition of Russian goods import case. Currently, the British and Russian sides will quickly try to resume the negotiations between the two sides before the Vicker's Company employee arrest case occurred. Sanmai and his party were released on Saturday and Sunday, and went to the British Embassy in Moscow to spend the night and will depart for London tomorrow night, escorted by the British Consul in Moscow to the Polish border.

<p>(Moscow) The British technicians Thornton and MacDonald, who were convicted in the Soviet Union of espionage and sabotage, were released at 11 p.m. today and will be escorted to the Soviet border tomorrow to return to England. Today, all newspapers published the following report issued by TASS: "On the afternoon of July 1, the British government stopped its action of boycotting Soviet Union imported goods since April. At the same time, the Soviet Union Foreign Trade Committee will also abolish the retaliation by the Soviet Union government against the British Boycott goods. In the evening conference of the presidium of the Soviet Union Central Executive Committee, it was decided to change the verdicts of Thornton and MacDonald into deportation according to the amnesty regulations. In order to carry out this resolution, Thornton and MacDonald were released in the evening and ordered to leave the Soviet Union immediately. As for the negotiations for concluding the Anglo-Russian commercial treaty, which were interrupted in March, they will be resumed by the suggestion of the British government. " (TASS, July 1)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Floodwaters Recede in Wuhan <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Dikes and Sluices Near the Suburbs Are Safe</p>
<p>Various Counties Report Disasters in Succession</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence - Until the 25th of last month, the waters of the Yangtze River in Wuhan fortunately did not continue to rise. The 26th, 27th, and 28th were stable, and the water began to recede on the 29th, dropping from the highest water level of 47.2 feet to 47 feet. From the 30th to the 1st of this month, it continued to recede by 2 inches each day, reaching a water mark of 46.6 feet. The riverbank has now reached the level of the plains. Superficially, it seems that the dangerous period has passed. However, the dikes and sluices near the suburbs still need repair, and disaster reports are pouring in from various counties. The return of the rainy season is imminent, and the level of danger may be several times greater than this time.</p>
<p>During the highest water level this time, the dikes and sluices near Wuhan were mostly in a precarious state. In addition to the Jinshui New Dam in Wuchang and the Xinhewan in Hanyang, which had collapsed one after another, the Wutai Sluice, Wufeng Dike, Wujin Dike, Wuhui Dike, Wuqing Sluice, Baishazhou Dike, Xujiapeng Dike, and Zhoujiazuizi Sluice in Wuchang all reported leaks. After the Flood Prevention Committee worked hard to repair them, they are now safe. However, the embankments of the riverside roads have been eroded and submerged in water for a long time, causing the soil and stones to seep and collapse suddenly. The losses are not very heavy. In order to prevent the return of the rainy season, the Flood Prevention Committee is still working intensely, resolving to repair all the dikes while the river water recedes. On the 1st, it organized nine engineering teams, each with 500 workers, and divided them into four sections to construct repairs. The first section is from Jinkou to Baiguan, the second section is the Wutai Sluice, the third section is Xiaxinhe, and the fourth section is the Wufeng Dike, spanning hundreds of miles. It is planned to complete all of them simultaneously within the shortest possible time. In Hankou, more than 300 cracks appeared in the riverside flood prevention dikes and 43 sluice gates and 13 culvert gates were blocked by the municipal government. Leaks were found at the Zhanggong Dike, the Daijiashan Sluice Gate, and the Liuhegou Wharf, as well as leaks at Fenjinlu and Chenjiaji. The Changfeng Dike has the lowest terrain and is particularly dangerous, but it has also been rescued separately by the municipal government, filled in, and thickened, and it seems that it has also escaped danger.</p>
<p>As for the various counties, they are still reporting disasters in succession. In addition to the 17 places counted by the provincial government, several more have recently been added. 1) Fankou: The entire town is submerged in water, and all the villages have become wetlands. The dikes and sluices are full of crevices and are in a precarious state. The dikes and sluices there are entrusted with the lives and property of the four counties of Wuchang, Daye, Huanggang, and Echeng, and the relationship is the most important. 2) Xindi: The entire city was flooded, and the main dikes along the river for eighty miles are on the verge of collapse. The areas of Luoshan and Tieniutang are particularly dangerous. 3) Songzi: The flooded area is very wide, and the disaster is very serious. 4) Shishou: More than fifty zhang of the Maocaoling Tanaojiang embankment collapsed, and more than 4,000 mu of farmland were flooded. The General Headquarters is paying special attention to the dangerous projects in various places. On the 1st, it issued orders to the troops stationed in various places, requesting them to assist the local flood prevention and rescue efforts as much as possible. It ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to formulate a plan and first contact the local garrison and county magistrate to avoid feeling difficulties in times of emergency. It also ordered the county governments to fulfill their responsibilities regarding the conscription of labor and materials and not to shirk their responsibilities in the slightest. If there is any failure in implementation, they will be severely punished. At the same time, the Engineering Office of the National Economic Commission appointed Zhang Chongji as the special inspector of the Xiangjiang Dike, Gao Lingmei as the special inspector of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Tang Shangsong as the special inspector of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Cheng Renwu as the special inspector of Wuhan, and Lei Zhongyun as the flood prevention engineer of Wuhan. They will set off separately today, and the eight simple rules for the inspection of the Jianghan dike project are stipulated as follows: 1) In order to strictly protect the main dikes of Jianghan, the main dikes of Jianghan will be divided into three areas during the flood season, and one special inspector will be set up in each area. 2) The sections of the first and second engineering offices below Hankou are the lower district of Hankou, the sections of the third and fourth engineering offices above Hankou and the Xindi engineering office are the upper district of Hankou, and the sections of the fifth and sixth engineering offices and the Shayang third engineering office in the Xiang River basin are the Xiang River district. 3) The special inspectors shall abide by various flood prevention regulations, inspect each dike at any time, and urge all levels of personnel in each engineering office to protect them carefully day and night. If there are special merits or negligence that causes errors, they shall truthfully report them for verification and handling. 4) The special inspectors shall obtain the daily water level of each sub-station of each engineering office and the progress report of all flood prevention work every day, and report it once every ten days. If there are special circumstances, they shall also send separate telegrams at any time. 5) The various charts and forms required by the special inspectors shall be borrowed from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau nearby. 6) The special inspectors may transfer one clerk or secretary from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to handle all affairs. 7) The travel expenses required by the special inspectors shall be reported according to the travel expense regulations of the association and paid from the flood prevention fee. 8) These simple rules shall be implemented from the date of approval (1st).</p>

<h3 id="e87">Taking Over the War Zone Is Temporarily Difficult to Implement <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Solution to the Puppet Army Depends on the Dalian Conference</p>
<p>The Takeover Committee Has Been Established in Tianjin</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Peiping - The issue of the puppet army in eastern Hebei has made considerable progress as a result of our side sending Lei Shourong and Yin Tong to Changchun with Mr. Nagatsu, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy. However, Li Jichun's troops have recently recruited bandits and expanded their strength within a month. There are actually eight or nine thousand people directly under his command. Moreover, the puppet troops of the newly compiled Wang Tiexiang and Liu Peichen, two units of the puppet state, have also been transferred from outside the pass to the Tangshan area. There are also two thousand people under the command of Li Jichun. Combining the troops of Shi Yousan, Hao Peng, etc., there are a total of tens of thousands of people. Although our side can allow Li to surrender and reorganize into a special police force, the quota is set at three thousand. Even if we can make slight concessions, it will not exceed five thousand at most, and there are still disputes over the garrison area. Since these preconditions are obstructed, there are inevitably thorny issues in the future. In view of this, our side sent Lei Shourong and Yin Tong again to Dalian yesterday (30th) morning on the Japanese ship Tianjin Maru. Xue Zhiheng, who is trying to stage a comeback, also went with them to meet with the personnel sent by the Kwantung Army Headquarters of Japan and Li Jichun in that place to seek a thorough solution. Lei et al. are scheduled to arrive tonight. Whether the puppet army issue can be resolved smoothly depends on this. It is said that Lei et al. are acting in a private capacity for half of this trip, having sincere consultations with Li, and all issues are only in the form of talks, not formal decisions. After there is a clue to the negotiations, they will return to Tianjin to report to the Takeover Committee for a final decision. As for Tao Shangming and Li Zeyi, etc. in Peiping, they went to Tianjin last night to meet with Yu Xuezhong. That evening at 8:00, Yu hosted a banquet at the Beining Gongyu. Qian Zongze, Liu Shisun, and Tao and Li discussed the procedures for taking over the war zone during the banquet, and then dispersed at 10:00.</p>
<p>The War Zone Takeover Committee held its inaugural meeting in the main hall of the Hebei Provincial Government at 11:00 this morning. The attendees were Yu Xuezhong, Qian Zongze, Wei Jian, Li Zeyi, Tao Shangming, and Liu Shisun, a total of six people. They discussed in detail the steps agreed upon in recent days and did not hold any ceremonies. The meeting adjourned at 12:30, and the committee members had lunch at the provincial government. In the afternoon, they continued the meeting at 2:00 and dispersed at 5:00. All affairs in the meeting are handled by transferring personnel from various departments of the Ji Provincial Government, and the office will start working today. The overall issue of war zone takeover will be negotiated with the Japanese Colonel Kita, etc. in Tanggu, and the Japanese commander Nakamura will consult on everything in Tianjin at any time. The Japanese army can withdraw in stages, and the Takeover Committee plans to send takeover commissioners to various counties in eastern Hebei and eastern Peiping to supervise and urge the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs to take over the lost land, rectify political affairs on the spot, and prepare for war zone relief. After local order is stabilized, they will be dismissed. The Beining Railway has been closed for a long time, and foreigners who want to go to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat are very anxious about this and hope that passenger trains will pass as soon as possible. Recently, Qian Zongze, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, negotiated with the Japanese side and requested that the train be opened to Qinhuangdao. The Japanese side advocated that the train should first be opened to Tangshan. In fact, Li Jichun's headquarters is still in Tangshan, and the puppet political organization of Hao Peng in Qinhuangdao has not been abolished. Moreover, after the section of railway between Yuguan and Tangshan was forcibly managed by the Japanese, they could earn more than 4,000 yuan a day due to the transportation of coal from Luan. Whether they can give up immediately is still under negotiation. At the same time, the Japanese army between Miyun and Gubeikou has not withdrawn. The troops stationed there are from the 8th Division. The Japanese side has unofficially indicated to us that they have decided to leave a brigade here and will not leave for the time being, intending to contain the progress of the anti-Japanese military affairs in Chahar Province, which is suddenly an excuse. The people of Peiping feel uneasy because Miyun is close to the suburbs of Peiping, and if the Japanese army does not withdraw for a day, they will feel a thorn in their backs and endless worries. The authorities are arguing with the Japanese side on the basis of reason. It will probably take some time to actually take over the war zone (July 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Resolution of the Chahar Incident Is Again in a Stalemate <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Peiping Authorities Put Forward Two Solutions</p>
<p>And Further Make Necessary Preparations</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Peiping - After Feng Yuxiang once again put forward four opinions on the Chahar incident, a sudden wave arose. Feng recently sent representatives Li Qi and Deng Zhexi to Peiping to express peace, but focused on urging Song to return to Chahar, saying that after Song returned to Chahar, there would be someone in charge of military and political affairs, and everything would be easily resolved. The Peiping authorities obtained the central government's opinion and decided on two solutions: 1) Handle the matter according to the results of the previous negotiations between Zhang Jiyong et al. and Zhangjiakou. Feng should immediately issue a telegram to cancel the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and Song should return to Chahar and take office after Feng cancels the title to handle the aftermath. 2) Feng insists on resisting Japan, and the government expresses its sympathy. Please Feng immediately lead his guards to the suburbs of Peiping to discuss the progress with the Peiping authorities. The above two solutions were carried back to Chahar by Li Qi the day before yesterday to solicit Feng's opinion. Deng Zhexi et al. stayed in Peiping to wait for a satisfactory reply before returning to Chahar with the representatives here to negotiate. It is said that Li is now in Zhangjiakou, conveying this intention to Feng. Feng did not express anything but invited Fang Zhenwu et al. to discuss something. Fang et al. were quite excited. Yesterday, Li sent a telegram to Peiping, only saying that Feng was considering the proposed solution and did not mention anything else. There was no telegram to Peiping today. According to a certain source, the atmosphere in Zhangjiakou is quite tense. Due to environmental and positional relationships, it may be difficult for Feng to cancel the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army for a while. Song Zheyuan is quite indifferent to returning to Chahar. He had previously sent a telegram to Feng expressing his bitterness due to the difficult situation. The telegram roughly said, "Representative Zhang returned to Peiping and described your instructions in detail. Zheyuan is in a difficult situation, and it may be difficult to return to Chahar. There are many thorns in the road ahead for you, and I hope you will take good care of yourself. I plan to go to Tianjin to recuperate due to a recurrence of my back pain." After receiving the telegram, Feng sent representatives to Peiping to explain, but Song was still quite passive due to the difficult situation. It is said that the authorities have recently made necessary preparations in addition to continuing to carry out the purpose of peace on the Chahar issue. If there is no new development, they will proceed according to the predetermined plan before the peaceful negotiations. A certain division in the Qinglongqiao area has been transferred. At 5:00 PM yesterday, Liu Wenfang, the captain of the 3rd Armored Train Team, led an armored train and 200 soldiers to Qinglongqiao to inspect (July 1st).</p>
<p>After Sun Dianying's appointment as the commissioner for reclamation in the western region of Qinghai was announced, he ordered his subordinates to actively prepare. Once the departure expenses are received, they will be dispatched in two routes. One route will go to Qinghai via Jincheng and Tongguan, and the other route will go directly to Baotou via Chahar, passing through Ningxia and other places. The military authorities will notify the area in advance. After Sun's troops leave, the troops in Chahar will be partially resettled, which will make it more convenient to resolve the Chahar issue (July 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e89">Shandong Provincial Government Takes Over the Jinan Arsenal <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Renamed the Ordnance Bureau and Has Been Taken Over</p>
<p>Will Also Manufacture Agricultural and Industrial Machinery in the Future</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The Jinan Arsenal of the Ministry of Military Affairs has now been transferred to the Shandong Provincial Government for management. Jiang Shaochang, a military counselor of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Liu Shouyu, a member of the Ordnance Bureau, Tang Xiang, the director of the Shandong Provincial Government's office in Beijing, Wang Xuezhi, the director of the Ordnance Bureau, and Hu Tianyi, the director of the factory, have completed the handover procedures. The Jinan Arsenal was renamed the Jinan Ordnance Bureau, and the handover was implemented this morning (1st). Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, appointed Wang Xuezhi, the director of the 3rd Ordnance Bureau, as the director of the Jinan Ordnance Bureau and went to take over. Hu Tianyi, the former director of the factory, ordered his department heads to be responsible for the handover. Because there are many parts in the factory, the inventory was not completed until the afternoon. The reporter learned that the factory has more than 1,500 workers and is one of the few arsenals in North China. I specially visited Wang Xuezhi to ask about the current situation of the factory, the handover process, and the future rectification plan. I am grateful to report them one by one as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e90">Current Status of the Factory <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>According to Wang, the factory is divided into three major departments: machinery, bombs, and bullets, with more than 1,500 workers. The administrative aspect is divided into three departments: general affairs, engineering, and inspection, and there is also an audit section. Unless there are special manufacturing expenses, the monthly labor and material costs are about 150,000 yuan. In recent days, he has been negotiating with Director Hu, Counselor Jiang, and Member Liu about the handover methods. The main points are that all old products will be transported to Beijing, and the existing materials will be fairly valued by the Ordnance Bureau after the inventory is completed, and the price will be paid. The inventory has not yet been completed and cannot be valued. However, the official seal documents have not been handed over. Our side has organized a takeover committee. Yu is the chairman of the committee, and Zhang Jincheng, Shi Enxian, Zhang Chengyuan, Liu Zixiang, Li Hanzhang, Zhang Chunting, Song Enxin, the section chiefs of the Ordnance Bureau, and a certain member of the military medical office are members, responsible for the takeover. It will probably take two or three months to complete. Work has now been suspended and will resume on the 3rd. Also, Member Liu of the Ministry of Military Affairs came to the bureau today to inspect.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Rectification Plan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>It is also said that Chairman Han's purpose in taking over this factory is to maintain the lives of more than 1,500 workers and their families of 5,000 to 6,000 people, and to manufacture bullets for the needs of the province's army and the militia groups of various counties for reserve. In the future, the rectification plan will be: First, the machinery factory will be reorganized to manufacture products. In addition to military supplies, it is also planned to manufacture machinery needed for agriculture and industry in order to resist foreign goods, recover rights and interests, and help rural areas. It is expected that the Ordnance Bureau will also serve as the Agricultural and Industrial Bureau. Because the current machinery factory can only repair machines but cannot manufacture products, the cost will be reduced as much as possible in the future to avoid waste. It is not yet certain whether the 3rd Ordnance Bureau will be merged here. If the central government needs supplies, this bureau should still provide them as usual as much as possible, because it is a temporary Shandong operation and not taken as its own, he also said (1st).</p>
<h3 id="e92">Dangerous Project Occurs on the Canal in Dezhou <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Water Level Drops in Wucheng and Linqing</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The water level of the Grand Canal in northern Shandong rose sharply a few days ago, and dangerous conditions occurred. The 74th Division Commander Li Hanzhang, who was stationed in Dezhou, was instructed by Chairman Han to dispatch troops to the dangerous sections along the river for rescue, which was very effective. Today (1st) at 3:00 PM, Sun Ziyun, a technician from the Construction Department stationed in Wucheng, reported by long-distance telephone that the water level of the Wei River (i.e., the Grand Canal) in Wucheng was 29.08 meters today, which was 32 centimeters lower than yesterday, and the project conditions were stable. The various dangerous projects in Wucheng are temporarily safe. The water level of the Wei River in Linqing once rose to 33 meters, and it has now dropped to 32.32 meters. It is heard that a dangerous project has occurred in Dezhou, but the details are not yet known. The Construction Department has dispatched technician Yao Xintian to be stationed in Dezhou to supervise the project. Yao has not yet gone to Dezhou because he is supervising the repair of the sand dikes in Enxian and Wucheng counties. However, Liu Shuxiang, the water conservancy commissioner of the fourth district, rushed to the rescue from Enxian after hearing the alarm. There are many 74th Division troops stationed in Dezhou, and they will join forces to rescue, so no accidents should occur (1st).</p>

<h3 id="e93">Absurd Actions of Moral Society Members <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Ren Shichang and others from Shandong Province, claiming to be supervisors of the International Moral Association, came to Songjiang and planned to organize a Songjiang branch in Chao Guo Zen Temple south of Chang Bridge. It is said that the purpose is to respect morality and plan to solicit members. A letter was sent to the County Party Department requesting the issuance of a permit. After investigation by the Party Department, it was deemed to be incongruous. Whether or not to allow the organization is still under review, and the County Public Security Bureau was notified to send personnel to Chao Guo Temple this morning (2nd) to inspect. Seeing a seal, they asked why there was a seal without permission to organize, and took it back to the bureau. Unexpectedly, Ren Shichang of the association, accompanied by Wang Peide, a native of the same province, holding a vermilion lacquered gold-lettered "Most Sage Confucius Divine Seat" memorial tablet and a rectangular flag with the words "Shanghai Moral Association," rang the bell along the way and sang "Down with the County Party Department," staggered through the city, directly to the front of the County Party Department, and lectured to the onlookers, criticizing the Party Department for the desolation and disrepair of the Confucius Temple in Songyi. The language was absurd, and the shape was like a divine trend. The Party Department called the Public Security Bureau by phone, and the team immediately sent a team to bring Ren and Wang back to the bureau. Director Shen personally visited County Magistrate Jin and asked for instructions on how to deal with them, and also invited Ye, a standing member of the County Party Department, to the county to discuss the matter. Then he returned to the bureau to interrogate Ren Shichang and others. The language was vague, with words like "We also plan to eat," and he also felt incongruous. The case was transferred to the court for adjudication.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Han Wentai's Torn Ticket and Corpse Retrieval <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Han Wentai, the head of Zhouxin Town, Xiexie Township, in the third district (Yangming Township) of the county, was robbed by more than a dozen bandits on the night of March 20th of this year. When they left, they kidnapped Han Wentai. Afterwards, the bandits repeatedly sent letters demanding a huge sum of more than 10,000 yuan. After Han's family repeatedly sent people to contact the bandits, the result was that the bandits had to extort a minimum of 8,000 yuan before allowing the ticket to be redeemed. The Han family tried every means to raise 2,400 yuan in cash, and entrusted someone to contact the bandits and hand over the money to the bandits. However, because the bandits obtained too little money, they still hid the ticket in the bandit den. Recently, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau captured four bandits involved in the kidnapping and transferred them to the county government for interrogation and detention. Now, it is learned that County Magistrate Yan of the county government also paid great attention to the case. Although he secretly ordered his subordinates to tighten the search for the remaining bandits and rescue the ticket, he could not find any clues. Therefore, the county case has not yet rescued the ticket. The day before yesterday, County Magistrate Yan suddenly received a secret report stating that the ticket bandit Yang A-bao (i.e., Zhou A-bao) was hiding in Zhoujiage above Zhangjingqiao, three miles away in the seventh district, and asked to send the police to arrest him as soon as possible. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Yan secretly ordered Wu Zhengrong, the political police chief, to find a way to arrest him. After receiving the order, Police Chief Wu led all the political police on a gasoline boat to the countryside to arrest him at about 6:00 AM yesterday (2nd). Yang A-bao was captured on the spot, and under strict interrogation, the bandit directly admitted to watching the ticket. The ticket, Han Wentai, was hidden in my house. He has now been torn up for about a month. The corpse is buried in a wild animal cave in the Gan Ke wilderness on He Feng near Zhang Wei. After obtaining the confession, Police Chief Wu led the bandit to the burial site to excavate, and indeed obtained Han Wentai's corpse, which had rotted and had no coffin. The most pitiful thing was that the corpse was actually cut into four pieces. He ordered the chief Chen Xiangsheng to be responsible for guarding. At the same time, Cheng Xu, the captain of the second police squadron stationed in Zhangjingqiao, also sent two patrol officers to assist in watching the corpse. The bandit Yang A-bao, who had been captured, was escorted to the city by Police Chief Wu and sent to the county government. The court was interrogated by clerk Yao, and he was ordered to be detained. A notice was sent to Han's family to go to identify the corpse, and Chief Chen Xiangsheng was scheduled to report to the county court for inspection today together with the corpse's family.</p>

<p>The Wuyi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association previously discovered a large number of undershirts at the Dajie Dahua Shopping Center, suspecting them of being enemy goods. The shopping center claimed that they were purchased from the Shanghai Xingxiang Factory and were not enemy goods. Subsequently, the factory issued a letter of proof. The Anti-Japanese Association, feeling suspicious, sent them to the Zhenjiang Anti-Japanese Association for identification, which confirmed that the undershirts were indeed enemy goods. The committee then decided to punish them. On the afternoon of June 30th, Gong Runzhai, who claimed to be the factory director of Shanghai Xingxiang Factory, came to Changzhou from Shanghai with a letter, claiming that the confiscated undershirts were indeed produced by their factory and were not enemy goods. He was received by Yue Xishan, the director of the inspection department, and produced a trademark rubber stamp as proof. However, the Anti-Japanese Association considered it a forgery because the trademark was different from the confiscated undershirts. They immediately prepared a document and sent Gong Runzhai to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. On July 1st, the association received a telegram from the Shanghai National Products Preservation Association, requesting the release of the detained person. The association immediately replied with a letter, explaining four reasons, stating that Gong's crime was different from ordinary profiteers.</p>

<p>The water stove case in the provincial capital, involving the water company's price increase, resulted in a unanimous strike. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a petition was submitted to the county party headquarters, which immediately convened its 58th committee meeting, with Shi Shunyuan, the training section chief from the provincial party headquarters, in attendance. It is reported that four resolutions were made regarding the water stove industry's dispute with the water company over price increases: 1) The water price for water stove businesses will be calculated at 90% of the adjusted price after mediation. 2) Water fee deposits and water meter deposit cabinets will be paid in installments. 3) If a water stove business does not operate for three days, the Public Security Bureau may revoke its business license and will notify the Public Security Bureau accordingly. 4) The water company shall not force any water stove business to use water if they are unwilling to bear the water price in the first resolution. The county party headquarters will dispatch Committee Member Xu Luan to respond. It is reported that all water stove businesses consider this satisfactory and will resume operations tomorrow.</p>

After separate and strict interrogation, the bandits confessed to the robbery and division of spoils. The case was reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval, and an order was issued to execute them. The department then signed the order yesterday, verified the identities of the bandits, and escorted them to the execution ground at the North Gate to be shot.</p>

<p>Recently, locust nymphs have been found all over this county. Although the county government has strictly ordered district chiefs to make every effort to eliminate them, they have been emerging one after another. Currently, the northeastern townships are filled with locust nymphs, and the seedlings have been severely damaged. In addition, there has been no heavy rain since the beginning of summer in this county. According to visitors from Baodun, brine has already flowed back to Baodun. Most of the seedlings there have been drowned by the brine, and the drinking water for the people is facing difficulties. The area along the She River has built dikes to block the brine. If there is no heavy rain in the next few days, the brine will reach the city.</p>

<p>Zhang Ji, a farmer from Xiaolüzhuang in the southern township, had a comfortable life, but had long been coveted by bandits. Last month, a number of bandits suddenly broke into his home, looted it extensively, and injured the owner. Before leaving, they kidnapped Zhang's beloved son, Zhang Ren, demanding a large ransom. After the ransom was not paid, it was discovered that the main culprit in this case was Zhang Rusong, who shared the same surname. Zhang fled the scene in fear of punishment. The Jiuliyan Public Security Branch captured four members of Zhang's gang. Through secret interrogation, they learned that Zhang was hiding in Shanghai. They immediately reported to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, which dispatched personnel to collaborate with the French Concession police to arrest Zhang at Dongxin Bridge. After taking him to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed the truth. The bureau telegraphed County Magistrate Guo of Danyang County, who immediately prepared a document and sent police officers to Shanghai. Yesterday, Zhang was escorted to Danyang. After a secret interrogation in court, he initially denied the charges. However, after his accomplice Zhang Dingbao was brought in for confrontation, he finally confessed.

<p>Thirty Hours in Shanghai</p>
<p>His whereabouts were extremely secretive</p>
<p>Wang Qingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, flew to Shanghai with Zeng Zhongming at 12:30 PM the day before yesterday on a China National Aviation Corporation plane to seek treatment for his back paralysis from Dr. Noel. He then took a car to the North Station last night and boarded the night express train to Nanjing. Those traveling with him included Chu Minyi, Yang Dezhao, Zou Lin, and others.</p>
<p>Wang's visit to Shanghai this time was extremely secretive. Our reporter received a telegram from Nanjing the day before yesterday, learning that Wang had indeed flown to Shanghai with Zeng Zhongming. That evening, he went to Wang's residence on Pushi Road to inquire. Wang's family denied this, saying that Wang was still in Nanjing and had not come. He then went to various related places, but could not obtain any information and was unable to confirm Wang's arrival in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, our reporter went to Wang's residence again to inquire. According to Wang's secretary, Lin Ruyan, Wang and Vice Minister Zeng did indeed arrive in Shanghai by plane at around 3:00 PM yesterday (July 1st) and went to Noel Hospital to treat his back paralysis. Last night (July 1st) at 11:00 PM, they had already taken a train from Zhenru Station back to Nanjing, and his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Tieci Zeng Zhongming did not travel with him. After Wang left Nanjing the day before yesterday, there were conflicting reports about whether he flew to Shanghai or Ganzhou. Only now has the truth come to light.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Sun Ke Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Talked Freely About the Recent Political Situation</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai last night on the night train from Nanjing. He arrived at the North Station at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning and immediately returned to his residence to rest. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Sun at his private residence yesterday morning and inquired about various issues, such as the new customs import tariff. He provided the following detailed answers:</p>
<h3 id="e109">New Customs Tariff <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Sun, the new customs import tariff was drafted by the Ministry of Finance, submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then submitted to the Central Political Council for review. The Central Political Council considered this tariff to be of great importance. If it were leaked, merchants would know which items would be subject to increased taxes and by how much, and would order and ship goods to China in advance to avoid the tax increase, leading to significant abuses. Therefore, it was decided to first announce and implement the tariff, and then submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review and amendment. Once the amendment is completed, it will be announced again and implemented according to the revised tariff. The Legislative Yuan is currently working on the review, based on the principle of protecting customs revenue. The import tax rate for luxury goods will be increased. For necessities, such as paper, etc., which can be manufactured domestically but are in short supply, the original tax rate will be maintained without increase. Other items that can be manufactured domestically and do not need to be imported will also be slightly increased. However, there will be very few revisions, and it will be completed soon. As for the dumping tariff, it has not yet been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Xinjiang Aftermath <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Turning to the Xinjiang incident, Mr. Sun said that since Special Envoy Huang arrived in Xinjiang to convey the central government's intentions and appease the people, the situation has eased. Various ministries, provinces, and armies have united and defeated Ma Zhongying's army. The government is currently studying the handling of the aftermath. In terms of politics, the provincial government must be reorganized to promote political reform. However, the candidates have not yet been decided. Special Envoy Huang may be appointed as the chairman, or someone else may be appointed. In terms of military affairs, because the provincial armies have not cooperated in the past, they must also be reorganized. Sheng Shicai's troops have made the most efforts to maintain local order. Therefore, after the reorganization of the provincial armies, they may be under his command. The central government has also dispatched troops to jointly maintain security. As for the Northeast Anti-Japanese troops who retreated to Russia and then entered Xinjiang, such as Ma Su and Li's troops, there is no specific plan on how to deal with them. The above issues are relatively easy to resolve. What is considered difficult is the province's finances. Because there are no banks established there, the provincial government has issued paper money in excess, amounting to 150 million taels, while the market price is only three cents per tael, with a total value of only about 4 million taels. Therefore, the finances are chaotic and the finances are difficult. The government plans to establish a branch of the Central Bank in the province to reorganize it. This proposal is also under study.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Opinions on Sichuan Affairs <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Sun went on to say that the rumor that Sichuan Reconstruction Director Liu Xiang borrowed 30 million yuan from Britain was completely untrue. Given the current global economic downturn, this huge loan is impossible, and the solution to the Sichuan problem cannot be achieved simply by borrowing money. Mr. Sun also expressed his views on the matter, saying that the reform of provincial administration lies in the ability of the military leaders to work together in harmony. On the negative side, they should jointly suppress bandits to alleviate the people's suffering and reduce the people's burden. On the positive side, they should strive for construction to restore local vitality. Currently, the armies are not thinking about this, but are competing for personal territory, causing internal strife, wasting resources, and harassing the people, which is extremely harmful and gives the Communists an opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, if the leaders do not realize this, there will be no hope of clearing up and reforming the provincial administration.</p>

Regarding the American cotton and wheat loan, Mr. Hu Zhantang sent two telegrams opposing it, which have been published in the newspapers. Since this matter has become a fact, I replied with an explanation, fearing that it would cause misunderstanding and resentment, so I did not reply.</p>

Li Dachao, the director of the First Section of the Municipal Government, and Legislative Committee Member Wang Xiaoying were also in Wusong, and they all welcomed General Ma at the Fortress Headquarters.

Li Dachao, the director of the First Section of the Municipal Government, used the telephone to notify the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Inspection Office, which reported to Director Wen Hongen. In addition to ordering Lu Ying, the captain of the Detective Team of the bureau, to send Wang Yao, the detective leader of the Seventh District Headquarters, and detectives You Hanwen, Fang Linggen, and Chen Caifu to provide strict protection, they also ordered Li Jing, the director of the Seventh District Headquarters, and the patrol officers of the First and Second Sub-stations of the Seventh District, and the chiefs and police officers of the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Sub-stations of the Fifth District Headquarters to set up posts along the way to implement security measures to ensure safety.</p>

<p>General Ma, accompanied by Zhang Dianjiu, the former deputy commander of the Northeast National Salvation Army, 郎 Guanpu, the former director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Finance Department, Zhou Weigong, the former director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Industry Department, and secretaries Ke Yin and Li Nongmin, and thirteen others, departed from the Huizhong Hotel in several cars at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to inspect the war zone in the Wusong area. Along the way, the dilapidated tiles and overgrown weeds, and traces of blood and bullets, were still faintly visible. The prosperity of the past has been reduced to ruins. The desolate situation was no less than that of an ancient battlefield. Mr. Ma and others were saddened by the sight and were filled with emotion. At around 11:00 AM, they returned to the hotel in the same cars to rest.</p>

<p>Mr. Ma then met with his subordinates, including Army Commander Xu, Army Commander Dai, Commander Liang, and Commander Xu, and forty or fifty others, at the hotel at 11:30 AM. He addressed his subordinates, saying, "After the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces fell under the iron heel of the violent Japanese. As a soldier, I stood up to raise the banner of resistance against Japan, to win glory for the country, and to fight for the dignity of the nation. Comrades have worked tirelessly, following me for nearly two years. The spirit of hardship and difficulty is commendable. However, due to lack of funds and ammunition, and lack of support, we gradually retreated to Russian territory and returned to China via transit. There are now forty or fifty people who have come to Shanghai. Although there are no specific plans for future work, I will do my best to find ways to settle them. If any comrades wish to revise their province's duties, they may take advantage of this leisure time to return to their hometowns. However, they must remain consistent in their anti-Japanese work and persevere to the end. Do not be distracted by prosperity and disturb your minds. The dead are gone, the living can make a difference. As long as there is a breath left, this determination will not waver. I hope to share this with all comrades." He then discussed settlement plans with his subordinates, including the distribution of travel expenses and all post-settlement issues. The discussion lasted for about an hour before it ended.</p>

<p>And Confiscate Pro-Rebel Gentry and Bandits</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Feng Yuxiang sent two telegrams to Shanghai, reporting that he is advancing on the puppet army of Zhang Haipeng, who is entrenched in Guyuan, and confiscating the property of pro-rebel gentry and bandits. The original text of the two telegrams is recorded below: 1) (Omitted above) I have ordered Ji's troops to form a first echelon and advance towards Baochang. The central route Jianwu occupied Ertai. Deng's army advanced from the line of Mantouying Gongxian towards Li Yanfangzi. Li's army advanced from the line of Baimiaotan towards Deshengyingzi. The enemy retreated upon hearing the news, and our army followed in pursuit. Recently, my division and Wang's detachment, along with the troops advancing from Dushi and Kou, have made contact near Guyuan. Zhang Haipeng's rebel troops in Guyuan are actively constructing fortifications, preparing to resist stubbornly. However, Guyuan has been surrounded, and our army is in high morale and will not be difficult to take in one fell swoop. Xiang Yan. 2) (Omitted above) (A) Zhang Haipeng, the rebel entrenched in Guyuan, has requested a large number of weapons and ammunition from the Japanese military's Mokki Brigade in Rehe, and is transporting them to Guyuan with more than a thousand mules and horses, attempting to resist stubbornly. (B) The enemy is full of tricks and has recently bought off a large number of bandits to burn, kill, and destroy the rural economy everywhere, making it impossible for our anti-Japanese troops to rest. Bandits such as Li Zhanyuan, Lao Erzi, Er Da Wang, and Yang Erba have been scattered and suppressed by Ji's troops and have fled to Shanuoquan, Lishenmu, Da Yila Fangzi, Dong Shun Tang, and Majiacun. Our army is following in pursuit and will soon be cleared up. Xiang Zhou.</p>

<p>The Sichuan war has become tense again in recent days. Liu Xiang, the reconstruction director of Sichuan, has been ordered to send troops to stop the conflict between Deng and Liu, so that he can focus on suppressing the Communist bandits in northern Sichuan. A Central News Agency reporter inquired about this with Fan Chongshi, Liu Xiang's representative stationed in Shanghai, yesterday morning. According to</p>
<h3 id="e124">Fan Chongshi <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Communist bandits in northern Sichuan are becoming increasingly rampant. If they are not suppressed immediately, they will spread to the entire province and affect the overall situation, which is no small matter. Director Liu was ordered to suppress the bandits and decided to use 100,000 troops to block the bandit area and suppress them severely. However, the conflict between Deng and Liu is becoming increasingly serious, which is enough to restrict everything. At the same time, Chairman Chiang telegraphed Director Liu, ordering him to lead more than 70,000 troops to separate the Liu and Deng armies. If both sides still do not listen and invade, then military force will be used to stop them, so that the Sichuan incident can be resolved as soon as possible, the Communist bandits can be suppressed as soon as possible, and Sichuan can be stabilized as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Fan also received a telegram from Director Liu, which said, "The war between Liu and Deng in western Sichuan has been repeatedly advised to mediate, but to no avail. They are outwardly compliant with the central government's orders, but inwardly disobedient, causing the Red bandits to take the opportunity to expand. This army has been coordinating the suppression of the Red bandits and must control the source of the chaos. I have repeatedly received telegrams from Deng's army saying that they are attacking Qianfu fiercely and cannot withdraw troops to fight the bandits. Directly attacking the force suppressing the Red bandits is no different from indirectly helping the bandits. Now, in order to implement the plan to suppress the bandits, this army has ordered a part of the army to cooperate with Tian, Yang, and Liu to encircle and suppress the bandits, and to send troops to stop the chaos in Sichuan and quell the source of the chaos. If they realize their mistakes, they should supervise the entire force to jointly suppress the bandits, and the Red bandits will not be difficult to eradicate completely. This plan has already been reported to Chairman Chiang." Liu Xiang.</p>

<p>Discussing issues such as wage increase requests from female workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association held its 20th Extraordinary General Meeting of Representatives of the first session at its association headquarters at 4 PM yesterday, discussing the issue of wage increases for female silk reeling workers in various factories, as well as the issue of improving employee benefits. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives present: Representatives from various silk factories including Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinfan, Yu Wengui, Shao Rongsheng, Zu Jinrong, Qian Xiaoqin, Zhang Shaosheng, Cha Zhaoshi, Tang Yeqin, Shen Huachen, and over fifty others. Shen Huachen reported the significance of convening the extraordinary general meeting and discussed the various proposals.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Shen Huachen reported: ㈠ The association's handling of affairs and difficulties in the past year. ㈡ Since the government issued silk industry public bonds to the association in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), distributing them to member silk factories based on the number of silk reeling machines, the industry has been unable to revive due to environmental pressures. The association has been criticized by the government. Fortunately, the government acknowledged the difficulties of the silk industry and approved the exemption of the payable public bond funds, significantly reducing the burden on the industry. ㈢ In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the government approved the issuance of silk industry public bonds by the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to subsidize the export of Chen-era silk from factories. This matter is now coming to an end. It is sincerely hoped that our industry colleagues will uphold the government's earnest efforts to safeguard the industry, fear the decline of the silk industry, and diligently strive for self-improvement. ㈣ The association previously petitioned the municipal government to allow Tianlai Silk Factory to repair its water pipes, which was not approved by the Municipal Public Works Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Araki Fears Our International Aviation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Accusing it of being an illegal movement</p>
<p>And intending to find ways to suppress it</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on June 28th that Army Minister Araki, at the regular cabinet meeting on the 27th, reported on the China issue, requesting that all cabinet members pay special attention. He stated that, according to recently obtained intelligence, the Nanjing government is establishing a large-scale air route between Shanghai and Berlin, and between Shanghai and Moscow, with Shanghai as the center. This will soon be realized. If this large-scale new air route appears, it will have a significant impact on military affairs in the Far East. In recent years, illegal movements have increasingly become internationalized. Therefore, the suppression of this type of construction is considered extremely important. Following Araki's report, the cabinet members requested the Ministry of Interior, in conjunction with relevant ministries, to immediately begin an investigation to devise a unified countermeasure.</p>
<p>After the communication, a directive was received stating that, considering the special circumstances of silk factories having their own water supply equipment, and to show consideration for the difficulties of businesses, a flexible approach will be adopted. Five accounting procedures are to be registered within a specified period. In addition to the association notifying the silk factories, it is requested that all representatives pay attention. ㈤ District committee members reported on the operation of silk reeling machines in their respective districts after the arrival of new cocoons.</p>
<p>Resolutions of various proposals: ㈠ Unified treatment methods for various silk factories: Resolved, to seek legal solutions through Party and government organs. ㈡ Decision on the association fees for this year: Resolved, to collect association fees this year at a rate of 5 jiao per silk reeling machine per year, to be paid in one lump sum. ㈢ Proposal on how to handle the matter of various silk factories requesting the Transfer, Consolidation, and Preservation Committees to rescind the subsidization of excess exports of silk and to not issue public bonds accordingly: Resolved, to request the three committees to rescind the original resolution and to handle the matter in accordance with the subsidy methods announced by the executive and legislative branches. ㈣ Proposal on increasing wages and changing methods: Resolved, to wait for Party and government organs to convene discussions to find a solution.</p>
<p>Letters from various silk factories: Eighteen silk factories from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, including Yuanji, Yuanxing, Baotai, Yuanxin, Hongsheng, and Fukang, have not yet received government public bond subsidies for 614 bales of Chen-era silk, making it impossible to load and export them. Therefore, at yesterday's extraordinary general meeting of representatives, it was resolved to send a letter to the Preservation, Consolidation, and Transfer Committees, questioning the reasons why these committees violated the original proposal of the Legislative and Executive Yuans to issue short-term public bonds for the silk industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), and for arbitrarily changing the distribution methods for subsidizing the export costs of Chen-era silk from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed sirs, we have received government consideration for the decline of the silk industry, issuing three million yuan in short-term public bonds for the silk industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), subsidizing the export of Chen-era silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, stipulating the end of May of this year as the deadline for subsidies. It is now known that the number of silk exported within the deadline is 20,614 bales in total. On the 23rd of this month, a joint meeting of the Consolidation Committee, the Transfer Committee, and the Fund Committee intends to allocate the surplus from the expenses of 7 yuan per bale of silk paid by silk merchants to the Transfer and Consolidation Committees to subsidize the export of another 614 bales of silk. The reasons for this are truly perplexing. If the committees have such a resolution, it is an illegal action, and the factories absolutely cannot recognize it. We respectfully offer the following reasons based on facts: ㈠ The Legislative Yuan passed the Public Bond Regulations, and the Executive Yuan announced the principles for subsidizing Chen-era silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, issuing a total of 3 million yuan in public bonds, with 140 yuan in public bonds subsidized per bale of silk. There are no other supplementary explanations or detailed rules. ㈡ The current number of silk exported is 20,614 bales, for which public bonds should be issued totaling 2,885,960 yuan. There is still a surplus according to the approved public bonds. ㈢ Since the public bonds have regulations, they should be strictly followed. The regulations stipulate that they are specifically for subsidizing the silk industry and should not be diverted for other uses. ㈣ The silk merchants have paid expenses to the Transfer and Consolidation Committees, and if there is a surplus in the reserve fund, it should be returned to the silk merchants. Even if we take a step back, it should be given to the silk merchants' group for use in the silk industry. However, the committees disregard the original proposal of the Legislative Yuan and the government's decrees, arbitrarily moving the surplus funds from the reserve expenses paid by the silk merchants and making a hasty resolution that we cannot recognize. Therefore, we jointly request your esteemed committee to immediately raise an objection to these committees, requesting the rescission of the resolution, and to submit a statement to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, as well as the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, stating the reasons for non-recognition. We beg for your assistance and request that you proceed in accordance with the Administrative Appeal Law to show great trust and to benefit the public. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association Committee."</p>

<p>The 14th of this month is the date of the French Democracy Commemoration. In previous years, a grand lantern parade was held every year. Last year, due to the economic downturn after the Shanghai war, it was not held. This year, the French authorities, considering the poor state of business and trade, still intend to suspend the lantern parade and only hold a meeting at the French Consulate General to celebrate. At night, the French Park will still be decorated with lanterns and fireworks, and people will be allowed to enter the park for a stroll. The French Avenue is currently having craftsmen erect poles in preparation for hanging lanterns when the time comes.</p>

<h3 id="e131">City Chamber of Commerce Petitions Legislative Yuan to Revise Joint and Several Liability for Partnerships <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Advocating the maintenance of the custom of proportionate sharing of liabilities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolution of the fourth session of member representatives, petitioned the Legislative Yuan yesterday to revise the joint and several liability for partnerships. The original text stated, "Petition for a request: The Chamber held its fourth member general meeting on June 25th. According to the proposals submitted by the six trade associations of Grains, Oil Cakes, Bean Noodles, Wheat Bran, Grains and Cotton, Rice Milling, and Timber, 'We believe that in our country's business organizations, except for the new-style enterprises in major trading ports, which occasionally adopt the company system, most ordinary businesses still use the partnership system. These types of partnership organizations account for the absolute majority in the business community, and their history is also the longest. The conditions for their organization must first be mutually agreed upon. This agreement is a valid contract. All rights and obligations regarding each partner's subscribed share and the sharing of profits and losses are clearly stated. The allocation of responsibility for external debts in the future is based on this agreement. If any partner has insufficient assets to pay off debts, the other partners are only responsible for the shares they hold. This unchangeable custom has become a common practice in the business world. Since the promulgation and implementation of the Civil Law Debt Compilation Enforcement Law on May 5th, the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the regulations regarding partnerships, namely Article 681 of the Civil Law, state that when the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the partnership's debts, each partner is jointly and severally liable for the deficiency. The original intention of the legislative authorities was to protect creditor rights. However, while protecting creditor rights, consideration should also be given to the debtor's situation to achieve fairness and justice. The establishment of such legal provisions completely disregards the inherent practices of commerce and the original customs of partnership operations. This forces partners to bear extra losses of joint and several liability due to the failure of a portion of the business, or even face the danger of sacrificing all their assets. This is unfair. Moreover, partners only enjoy the right to share profits in proportion to their shares, but bear joint and several liability for external debts. Considering the meaning of the reciprocal relationship between rights and obligations, it does not seem appropriate. Taking Shanghai as an example, cases formed due to the aforementioned legal provisions have emerged one after another. The old partnership organizations are urgently seeking dissolution, and new organizations are disappearing from the market. Who would dare to try again after weighing the pros and cons? From then on, the organization of partnership businesses will become a past relic in history. This strict legal restriction is no less than blocking the opportunity for individual economic development. It is not only greatly related to the rise and fall of commerce but also has a great impact on the entire social economy. Our Chamber cannot ignore the situation we have witnessed. We dare to jointly petition your esteemed Chamber to gather public opinion and maintain commerce, and to forward this to the government and the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Please propose to amend Article 681 of the Civil Law as soon as possible to determine that partnership debts are shared in proportion to shares, without joint and several liability, and to maintain the inherent customs to conform to the freedom of contract. Otherwise, temporarily suspend the application of the aforementioned legal provisions until the Civil Law is amended in the future. All merchants in the country will rely on this. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await your public decision.' It was found that this matter was submitted by the Chamber to your esteemed Yuan on March 10th.</p>
<p>We requested that your esteemed Yuan amend the item in question, on the grounds that the national legislative policy should protect both creditors and debtors, according to the principle of joint protection, with debts shared in proportion to shares, ultimately settled with a discount if there are insufficient funds to repay. This is a common practice in our country's business community. Creditors' investments are not necessarily concentrated in one store. Even if debts are repaid at a discount, it is the same as having a discount in trade, and there is no danger of bankruptcy. If debtors are held jointly and severally liable, creditors must recover their principal and interest in full. In this situation, partners may not be able to repay even if they go bankrupt. This kind of European and American characteristic that uniquely favors the creditor and uniquely cruelly treats the debtor does not conform to our country's spirit of fairness and forgiveness. If this example prevails, why would investors not invest in land and housing instead of partnering to do business? Even if there is a danger of fluctuations in land value, at most they would lose their land and housing, and would not go completely bankrupt and be involved in endless troubles. This kind of policy is only enough to guide cash to concentrate in the city and hinder the development of industry and commerce. From the merchants' point of view, there are lenders and borrowers. Creditor and debtor are not like two completely separate entities. This argument is not to reduce one's own responsibility but to seek fairness in legislative policy. Subsequently, on March 23rd, we received a reply from the Secretariat of your esteemed Yuan, stating that it had been instructed to refer to the Civil Law Committee for reference. The revision is still a distant prospect. The impact on commerce is not minor. After being submitted to the General Assembly for a vote, it was resolved to be passed and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for revision on file. It is appropriate to record the case and present it for your esteemed Yuan's review, and to approve its implementation. Respectfully presented to the Legislative Yuan."</p>

The elegiac couplet in the center of the mourning hall was given by his divorced wife, Zhao Zhidao, which read: "Standing among the crowd of snipers, the sound of a falling tree leads to the loss of a gentleman. A single sleep leaves endless sorrow. When will the chaos subside, and the country will be without a day to mourn?" "Considering the two young children in front, I still have the responsibility to raise and care for them. Thousands of times thinking about the past, separation in life brings regret, and farewell in death brings swallowed voices."

At 3 PM, members of the society Wang Jiliang and Hu Gangfu paid their respects in front of the coffin, and then the mourning table was removed. Yang's son Xiaofo, wearing mourning clothes, stood holding the spirit tablet, and members of the society Wang Jiliang, Hu Gangfu, Ding Xunfu, and Zhou Ren helped the coffin onto the prepared hearse. The car was covered with fresh flowers, and Zhao Zhidao's wreath was hung in the front, which read "Eternal rest for Mr. Yang Xingfo" and "Cried and mourned by Zhao Zhidao." The funeral procession set off at 3 PM from the Universal Funeral Home. First, Chinese police opened the way, followed by the hearse.

<h3 id="e138">Ministry of Communications Convenes Meeting on Methods to Prevent Pirates <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>

<p>Shanghai Navigation Association to Send Representatives to Attend</p>
<p>Merchant ships of various shipping companies operating on the seas of the four provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong have been repeatedly attacked by pirates. The Shanghai Navigation Association, in view of the rampant piracy, has telegraphed to request strict suppression and has drafted preventive measures to be submitted to the ministry for adoption. Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua believes that preventing pirates from attacking merchant ships is very important and has scheduled a meeting to be held in the capital at 9 AM on the 10th of this month, inviting relevant agencies to discuss the matter together. It is reported that the Navigation Association has received an order from the ministry to send representatives to attend the meeting in Beijing at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Collection of Fishery Development Fee Still Awaiting Mediation <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Director Added to Construction Fee Collection Office</p>
<p>Official from the Ministry of Industry Appointed to Serve, Having Assumed Office Yesterday</p>
<p>The dispute over the collection of fishery development fees by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Association has been delayed for months without resolution. The reasons held by both sides are extreme. In order to clarify the truth, the New News Agency reporter inquired from all parties and recorded the information obtained as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Collection Methods <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, in order to develop the fishing industry, in addition to opening up saline resources, and to eliminate pirates and subsidize national defense, based on the principle of "taking from fishing and using for fishing," organized the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Association and determined the collection methods for fishery development fees. The fees collected are to be collected by the fish markets and stored in a special account, and a weather forecasting plan for important fishery locations in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area is to be implemented at any time, and patrol ships are to be added to protect the safety of the fishing industry at sea.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Motivation for Opposition <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Association's construction fee collection office began collecting fees on April 15th, and divided the area into ten districts due to the vastness of the jurisdiction. The collection of fishery products is divided into five categories: ㈠ fresh fish, ㈡ salted fish, ㈢ dried fish, ㈣ marinated fish, ㈤ shellfish. The collection standard is 1% of the value, deducted by the fish markets and submitted. However, the collection personnel have been harassing and demanding various unreasonable amounts that are not stipulated in the regulations, and even fractional amounts are calculated as whole numbers. Also, shellfish and other categories have always been imported goods, and customs duties have already been collected by the customs at the time of import. The construction fee collection office is collecting construction fees again. Therefore, the fish industry groups in Hangzhou Zhaishan, Ningbo, Shipu, Dinghai, Zhenhai and other places, in order to avoid pain, have risen up to oppose the organization of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry United Company to form a banner and negotiate with the Improvement Association.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Three Mediations <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>In order to avoid misunderstandings between the two sides, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo specially invited Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and Yu Zuoting to mediate twice with Meng Lujiu and other representatives of the Fish Industry United Association. At that time, the opinions of the two sides were not completely consistent, so the various misunderstandings of the past still need to be explained. It is heard that Du and others still need to mediate a third time in order to resolve the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Suspension of Fee Collection <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Before the two sides reach a resolution, only 5 of the 25 fish markets in the city have paid the fees, while the rest have suspended payment. Therefore, the construction fees collected by the collection office are very small. The salaries of the staff have not been paid for nearly three months. The director of the office, Dai Yongtang, has personally advanced more than 10,000 yuan for office expenses. The 2,000 yuan in operating expenses per month promised to subsidize the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Administration has not been allocated at all. Therefore, as of now, all fees have been suspended, and the work is also at a standstill.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Sending Assistance <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Dai Yongtang, the director of the construction fee collection office, is from Zhenhai. He was originally the general affairs director of the Ice and Fresh Industry Association. Since taking office, he has been strongly opposed by all parties, and his attitude has been quite passive. He has also been deeply saddened by the various harassments of the staff in various districts. The Ministry of Industry has become aware of these difficulties and has specially appointed Luo Yonghu, a specialist committee member from Guangdong, as the deputy director of the construction fee collection office to assist in all matters. It is learned that Mr. Luo has arrived in Shanghai by the Beijing-Shanghai train and assumed office yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Future Predictions <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to the New News Agency reporter's inquiries from all parties, the Ministry insists on collecting 1% of the construction fees and will not allow changes. The fish merchants have consistently opposed the collection of construction fees. However, in order to seek construction expenditures for the fishery industry and protect the safety of the fish merchants at sea, the Ministry can open up new avenues and collect a certain amount of ocean protection fees, which can be done in reality. Fortunately, the mediators have considerable relationships with each other, and it is expected that this major storm may come to an end after three mediations.</p>
<h3 id="e146">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Marine Engineers to Submit Request to the Company Again Today, Willing to Take the Exam <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>| But Refuse Foreign Examiners and Must Set New Salary Increase Method |</p>
<p>More than 80 marine engineers from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Jianghai vessels are planning to submit a request to the company again today, after the company replied with two methods regarding the request for a salary increase. The content roughly states that China has never had a marine engineering school, so most of the marine engineers are uneducated. However, they have more than ten years of experience, so the exam may not be a problem. However, they refuse to be examined by foreigners, and the company must set the salary increase method after passing the exam and stipulate that the exam should be held twice a year to give those who fail a chance. Currently, the vessels have not yet returned to Shanghai, so a reply will be made after all the marine engineers have unanimously agreed.</p>

<p>Five Measures Signed</p>
<p>The Heshun Wharf in Pudong was recently leased to the Zhongxing Company Guangzu Warehouse. The failure to properly accommodate the old workers caused public outrage and led to a dispute. Representatives were sent to seriously negotiate with the authorities of the Zhongxing and Heshun companies, and a request was submitted to the Party and government agencies for assistance. At 9 AM yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned both parties to the bureau for mediation. Wu Yaoting and Li Bingfa from the labor side, foreman Zhang Dehua, Long Peiyun representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wang Guoxian representing the Public Security Bureau attended. The meeting was chaired by Wang Gang from the Bureau of Social Affairs, with Wang Zhiqin as the recorder. After both parties stated their reasons, five solutions were immediately formulated as follows: ㈠ The original full-shift foreman will continue to be hired by Zhang Dehua. ㈡ The original full-shift foreman should obey the instructions of foreman Zhang Dehua and Ling Qishuang in assigning the command of running the wharf. ㈢ If Zhang Dehua needs to dismiss the original foreman due to major misconduct, he should first submit it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval before dismissing. ㈣ The original workers will continue to work as usual under the leadership of the original full-shift foreman. ㈤ Foreman Zhang Dehua will handle the treatment of the foreman and workers as usual. With the agreement of both parties, a resolution was announced.</p>

<p>The car transport of spring cocoons produced in various parts of Zhejiang Province via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway this year has now concluded. It is understood that this cocoon transport has always been undertaken by the Huitong Transportation Company under a special contract with the Railway Bureau. Therefore, this year the company continued to handle the transport, with cocoons being loaded at various stations and transported to Shanghai. This ended at the end of June. In total, only 54,500 packages of spring cocoons were unloaded at the North and South stations. In recent years, silk prices have been steadily declining, and factories have been reducing or ceasing production. Consequently, the amount of cocoon transport has decreased year by year. Compared to last year's total of around 120,000 packages, this year's figure is down by six-tenths. It is also learned that summer cocoons in various parts of Zhejiang Province have also been launched on the market and weighing has commenced. Purchase prices for summer cocoons are the same as for spring cocoons. Chang'an was the earliest area. Yesterday, the first batch of summer cocoons was reported for loading by the Huitong Company at Chang'an Station. These were purchased by the Shanghai Wuxing Silk Factory: 178 packages of summer cocoons, 116 packages for Yu Tai, and 129 packages for Rui Yu. All were transported to the South Station for unloading and delivery. It is said that the total number of summer cocoons this year is approximately five or six thousand packages.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Tobacco Merchants Petition for the Abolition of the Special Tax on Native Tobacco Leaves <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Ministry of Finance recently announced regulations for the special tax on native tobacco leaves. Starting from July 1st of this year, the old public sales fee will be abolished and replaced with a special tax. Native tobacco leaves produced in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian will be subject to a special tax of 4.15 yuan in national currency per 100 market catties net weight, collected in one lump sum. Subsequently, transportation and sale within the seven-province area will not be subject to further taxation, etc. Local tobacco merchants believe that the tobacco leaf business has plummeted in recent years. While the reasons are not limited to one factor, the high cost and the inability to raise prices are indeed important reasons. The high cost is primarily due to the heavy tax rates and transportation costs. This has caused tobacco merchants to hesitate to move forward. Even if they purchase tobacco leaves, there is no profit to be made, and the accumulation of tobacco leaves in the producing areas prevents them from being shipped out, causing difficulties for both tobacco merchants and farmers. This impact already existed during the old public sales fee era. Although the newly promulgated special tax is an improvement over the public sales system, the tax rate is too high, and tobacco merchants and the people cannot bear the burden. The local Tobacco Leaf Industry Association has repeatedly received reports of difficulties from its members and has submitted a petition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the special tax on native tobacco leaves be temporarily suspended to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Meanwhile, representatives Huang Fuqing, Wang Zuoting, Zhuang Zhikuan, and the acting chairman of the association, Hua Daxiu, have been dispatched to Nanjing to petition the government. Furthermore, a letter from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan to the Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association Joint Association stated: "Greetings, A document forwarded by the President of the Yuan has been received, regarding the Tax Administration's preparation to illegally collect taxes on native tobacco and alcohol, requesting prompt prevention, etc. Approved: Noted. Since the document has been submitted, please await instructions from the relevant administrative authorities. The original document is sent to the Finance Committee of this Yuan for reference, etc. In addition to forwarding it, this letter is to inform you for your reference. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association Joint Association, Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, June 30th."</p>

<p>Huang Jinfu, a native of Pudong, aged 21, was a shop assistant in the Changhe Rice Shop on Niuzhuang Road. His behavior was undisciplined, and he was habitually idle. As a result, his monthly income was all spent on extravagance. Recently, he secretly took dozens of yuan from the shop's account and spent it on entertainment. The shop owner, seeing his lavish spending, secretly investigated and reviewed the accounts. He discovered that dozens of yuan were missing and questioned Huang. Knowing that he could not deny it, Huang confessed and promised to return the money immediately. However, Huang's family was poor and could not afford such an amount. Desperate, he privately checked into the Shanghai New Hotel at the Daxin Street intersection yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. and committed suicide by taking poison. He was discovered by a tea server at the hotel, who reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Patrolman No. 808 transported him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the poisoning, he died at 6 p.m. The hospital sent the body to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<p>Date of Incident Not Very Recent</p>
<p>Regarding the discovery of a murdered female corpse in the destroyed dormitory of the China Public School in Wusong, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper, we now have more detailed information to continue reporting. The corpse was wearing a purple floral-patterned qipao made of free cloth, with a white cotton long vest underneath, grey cotton shorts, and bare feet, wearing blue saving shoes. Beside the body was only a powder box, with no other belongings. There was an injury to the head of the corpse, with blood covering the ground. Underneath the corpse was a June 29th Shanghai Times newspaper, indicating that the incident likely occurred on the evening of June 29th. Beside the corpse were several pieces of food such as bread and preserved plums, suggesting that a love affair had gone wrong, leading to the tragic murder. It is unknown whose daughter she was. The local bailiff has reported the case to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau and the Shanghai District Court for investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the District Court dispatched Prosecutor Xie Lian to Wusong for examination. The examination determined that the corpse died from injuries. The bailiff, Pu Yousheng, was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial, pending identification by family members.</p>

<p>Gao Li, a woman from Changzhou, is currently 39 years old. She has a daughter named Xiangmei, who is 19 years old and quite attractive. Due to poverty at home, she brought her daughter to Shanghai several years ago, renting a room in Yangshupu. Her daughter found work at the Dacheng Yarn Factory, where she earned a meager living. Recently, she met Gao Ronghai, a fellow villager who works at the Sensen Optical Factory in Hongxing Lane at the end of Yu Xing Road. Seeing that Xiangmei was somewhat attractive, he had bad intentions. He falsely claimed that working in the factory was too hard and that he could introduce her to work at the Ximen Maoge Factory, where she could earn 40 to 50 yuan per month. Gao Li, seeing the potential profit, did not suspect him. On the morning of the 16th of last month around 10 a.m., he pretended to help send her to work at the Maoge Factory and took Xiangmei away, but she did not return for several days. The mother went to Gao Ronghai to negotiate, asking him to return her daughter. He initially agreed to delay for three days. When she went to negotiate again, Gao Ronghai instead gathered a dozen unemployed vagrants and went to Gao Li's home, where they committed assault. The woman was alert and escaped, reporting it to the Fourth Police Station of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau. The police arrested Ronghai. The others involved in the assault fled when they saw things were not going well. After being detained, Ronghai admitted that he would hand over Xiangmei within a week. However, he still did not return the girl by the deadline. Yesterday, Li personally apprehended Ronghai and handed him over to the Zhabei Judicial Section. She also hired a lawyer to draft a complaint to the District Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Gao Ronghai of inducing a minor for illicit purposes, under Article 257, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting punishment, and requesting the Judicial Section to approve the transfer of Gao Ronghai to the District Court for questioning.</p>

<p>丨Sentenced to a Fine of Forty Yuan丨</p>
<p>Xu Hongqing, from Yancheng, opened a pancake shop at 374 Yuanfang Road. He married a woman surnamed Mou in his hometown. Two years ago, he cohabitated with Wang Suzhen (25 years old), a woman from his neighborhood, in the shop, as if they were husband and wife. Recently, Suzhen suddenly changed her behavior, often going to listen to local opera and watch movies, and playing mahjong. Xu repeatedly tried to dissuade her, but she refused, so he rebuked her. At the beginning of last month, Xu returned to his hometown for business and only returned to Shanghai on the 26th. He learned that Suzhen had been away for three nights. Xu questioned her harshly. She claimed that she had been out watching a play and it was late, so she stayed at a little sister's place. Xu was furious and stripped Suzhen of her clothes, tied her hands and feet with iron chains, beat her severely with a wooden stick, and locked her in the bedroom, preventing her from leaving. She cried for help, but no one responded. She could only wash her face with tears every day. A neighbor anonymously reported the incident to the police. Detective Liu Zhongcheng was immediately ordered to arrest Xu Hongqing and rescue Wang Suzhen, along with the iron chains. The incident was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for questioning by Judge Wu Zehan. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained the situation, stating that the victim, Wang Suzhen, had been examined by a doctor and found to have suffered severe injuries to her body and legs, with medical certificates as proof. He then presented the wooden stick and iron chains for inspection. The defendant confessed to having an affair with Suzhen, but denied the rest of the story, stammering. Wang Suzhen testified that she had been severely beaten by the defendant and did not want to go back. Judge Wu reviewed the testimony and sentenced Xu Hongqing to a fine of 40 yuan as a warning.</p>

The driver of the train saw him and honked the horn as a warning, but it was too late. He was knocked down, and his head was bleeding profusely. Nearby patrol officers rushed to investigate and found that he had already died. They reported it to the Fourth District Headquarters. Since no family members of the deceased could be found, a local bailiff was assigned to guard the body, pending a report to the court for examination.</p>

On the morning of the 20th of last month at 8:55 a.m., Shen's brother and sister boarded the car to go to work, with the chauffeur Zhu Guangfeng driving. As Zhu brought Yiyao to the Customs Library at No. 1714 Xinza Road, Yiyao got out of the car, and Mengyi was kidnapped by four kidnappers and taken away, disappearing without a trace. Shen's car was later discovered near Rihui Port that evening, but it was empty, and there was no sign of anyone.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Ransom Negotiations <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>After the case occurred, the Concession police authorities took it very seriously and ordered their subordinates to solve the case within a specified time. However, the kidnappers were very cunning and maintained close contact with the hostage's family, preventing the police from intervening. It is said that the initial demand was very high. After several rounds of negotiations, the kidnappers agreed to a minimum ransom of 80,000 yuan. Although Shen was wealthy, he was unwilling to part with such a large sum, so the matter was delayed and no deal was reached. Until yesterday afternoon at around 5 p.m., Hua Detective You A’gen of the Lao Zha Police Station suddenly received a tip-off, stating that the hostage in the case was being held at 559 Avenue Joffre. He was requested to arrest them quickly.</p>

<p>After receiving the tip, Detective You immediately joined Western Detective Robert, Hua Detectives Liu Junqing, Zhou Guisheng, Su Changsheng, and the general team, and traveled by car to report to the French Police Special Agency. Inspector Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Zhang Ziying, Deputy Chief Detective Zhou Yaoting, along with detectives Cai Jinzhang, Qin Youyu, Zhang Chunsheng, Yang Jiaxue, Geng Quanchang, Xu Guilin, and Western Detective Glodi, went to the address. Detective You carefully examined the address at No. 559, a three-story Western-style building along the road. To the west was the Wanfu Lane, and across the street was the Gujiazhai Garden.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Intense Shootout <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>After Detective You finished his inspection, he ordered the surrounding area to be tightly surrounded. He then led the detectives to break into the building through the main door. As they were about to go upstairs, the kidnappers upstairs had already heard the alarm and knew things were not going well. They each took out guns and resisted from the corners. Avenue Joffre was filled with the sound of gunfire, like a string of pearls. The two sides exchanged fire for over thirty shots, lasting for a quarter of an hour. The kidnappers finally surrendered and were captured. The hostage, Shen Mengyi, was safely rescued from the third floor, and escorted to the police station. Then the remaining kidnappers were searched for.</p>

Two six-inch Browning pistols were seized (one with five live rounds, one with six live rounds), and one four-inch pistol, with five bullets. During the shootout, the legs and arms of two kidnappers, Dong Yongliang and Tao Xiaozhang, were injured. They were also taken to the French Police Station.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Apprehension of the Kidnapper Leader <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>After a strict interrogation by the police chief, the kidnappers confessed that their leader, Ma Qiaosheng (30, Wuxi), was hiding at No. 13 in the Guianli on Route Tenant de Tour. The detectives went to the address and apprehended Ma after a brief interrogation. The eleven kidnappers, including men and women, along with the hostage, were handed over to Detective You for investigation. According to the hostage, since being kidnapped, the kidnappers had treated him relatively well in the den, prohibiting him from going downstairs or looking out the window. He was only allowed to sit or lie down on the bed. A Ningbo man with a Cantonese appearance, who worked as a cook, delivered three meals a day. This kidnapper has not yet been apprehended.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Farmer Kills Wife and Chops Her into Eleven Pieces <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>丨Out of Rage for Wife's Infidelity丨</p>
<p>Gu Futao, a resident of Baiyangzhai, a village on the border of Baoshan County north of Wusong, was quite fierce. He was 31 years old and worked as a stone mason. Two months ago, he spent 80 yuan to buy a woman surnamed Hu from Nanhui as his wife. However, although she was ordinary in appearance, she was extremely flirtatious and unwilling to be a farmer's wife, often going out and staying overnight under various pretexts. Futao repeatedly tried to persuade her, but she did not listen, causing him to hate her deeply. A murderous intent arose in him. Late the night before last, while Hu was fast asleep, Futao suddenly grabbed a sharp axe and chopped at Hu's head several times, killing her instantly. He then used a wooden bucket to chop Hu's body into eleven pieces, including one piece for the head, one for the chest, one for the abdomen, and four pieces each for the arms and feet. He put the pieces in the bucket and hid it in the wall. After the incident, he kept it a secret. Yesterday morning, Futao and his mother, Wang, prepared luggage and bedding, intending to flee. However, a neighbor saw Futao acting慌张 and questioned Wang, who revealed the whole story. The neighbor then arrested Futao and his mother, Wang, and handed them over to the Baoshan County government for detention. County Magistrate Jin personally went to inspect and emptied the body from the wooden bucket. The inspection was a gruesome sight. The abdomen was completely exposed with all the internal organs. The body was exposed to the hot sun, and the stench was overwhelming. The sight made onlookers nauseous, and the road was blocked.</p>

<p>丨Children's Welfare Association Adds Daycare Group丨</p>
<p>Senior officials from the Municipal Health, Public Security, Social Affairs, and Education Bureaus, including Wu Liguo, Gong Yushuo, Chen Lengseng, Chen Bai, Chen Songchun, Feng Liudang, Hu Shuyi, and Wang Guanyi, recognizing the absence of daycare services in the city, organized the "Shanghai Municipal Daycare Service Promotion Committee." The inaugural meeting was held yesterday at the Municipal Public Education Center, chaired by Wang Guanyi. He first reported on the need for daycare services in the city and the reasons for initiating the organization of the committee. Then, the articles of association and funding issues were discussed. It was generally agreed that the city already has a Children's Welfare Association, which the Social Affairs Bureau and other agencies have reported to the Municipal Government that it receives monthly regular funding. The planning of children's films, children's broadcasting, and other children's welfare services can also be merged into the association. The association can add a daycare service group, and the initiators of this committee can request to be members of the group and jointly operate it, which would be more effective. Then, a photograph was taken and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Will Proceed to Nagasaki Shipyard in Japan for Repairs</p>
<p>Two French Warships Escorting Her Return to Original Defense Post</p>
<p>The Aramis, a French mail ship from the French Postal Company's Marseilles route, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday after hitting a reef in the waters off Putuo, Zhejiang Province, on the 23rd of last month. It will be unloaded and will proceed to Japan for repairs in the shipyard. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>The passengers' luggage and mail on the Aramis have been transported to Shanghai by the Shanghai company's De Feng Shipping Company barges. As for the two "Bans" and the engineers and workers from the Qiuxin Factory, they will first repair the breached part of the fourth cargo hold on the mail ship. After the initial repairs were completed on June 30th, it sailed to Shanghai. It arrived in Shanghai at 6 p.m. on the same day and berthed at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Pudong. Over 3,400 pieces of cargo shipped to Shanghai from France were unloaded and are being unloaded.</p>

<p>After the mail ship arrived in Shanghai, the two French warships berthed alongside, the Bellimaux and Argonaute, simultaneously sailed back to their original defense posts. After the two "Bans" from the Shanghai French Postal Company arrived in Shanghai, they consulted on the matter of entering the shipyard for repairs. However, as none of the shipyards in Shanghai could accommodate the 24,000-ton mail ship for repairs, it was decided that after the ship unloaded its cargo, it would sail to Nagasaki, Japan, to enter the shipyard for repairs.</p>

They have requested Mr. Mei Lanfang and other famous actors to perform a charity show for one day at the Tianchan Stage in order to raise funds to rescue the disaster-stricken private schools. It is said that it has been scheduled for July 4th.

<p>Since July 1st, used clothing workers have uniformly stopped calling out at stalls for meals. After this was implemented, the shops on Fujian Road all complied. However, the Yuan Yuxiang, Fengruitai, and San shops strongly opposed it, disregarding the suffering of the workers, and strictly ordered their workers to continue calling out at stalls for meals as usual. Other shops are also expected to follow suit, causing extreme resentment among the workers. A small dispute occurred, but it was successfully contained by the efforts of the Lianyi Society's maintenance team.</p>

<p>丨Result of Explanation by the International Trade Bureau丨</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, after the Philippine inspection delegation came to Shanghai, not only entertained them but also, for the sake of developing trade between China and the Philippines, held two meetings with the delegation in the bureau. Full discussions were held on the development of trade between the two countries. Considering that China's ham exports to the Philippines were substantial annually, but the Philippine authorities, not understanding the production methods, suspected uncleanness and therefore refused import, the bureau explained the production methods to the delegation and requested them to explain and lift the ban to the Philippine authorities after returning to their country. According to Guo Weibai, the chief of the General Affairs Department of the bureau, after the Philippine inspection delegation returned and reported, the ban on ham exports to the Philippines has been lifted. The people of the Philippines have always liked to eat this ham, so with the ban now lifted, the foreign trade of ham should be able to restore previous trade figures.</p>

Therefore, with regard to long-term brokerage licenses, whether there are substitutions or replacements, or whether old licenses are being fraudulently used multiple times, officials should be dispatched to investigate to verify the facts. Therefore, County Magistrate Cao has specially appointed Commissioner He Shanqing to go to various brokers to conduct thorough investigations. In addition to separately issuing letters to the municipal and county public security bureaus yesterday, ordering them to assist at any time, he also sent letters to the municipal chamber of commerce and ordered the county chambers of commerce to inform the various brokers.</p>

<p>丨Increased Fee Issue Still Being Negotiated丨</p>
<p>The case of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications increasing telephone fees, due to the unbearable burden on businesses, has led to disputes that have not been resolved for a long time. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Zheng Chengqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to inquire about the situation of negotiations with the Telephone Bureau. According to the answer, regarding the restoration of telephone service, after my numerous negotiations with the Bureau, any member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can be restored immediately after notification from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. As for the issue of increased fees, it is still under negotiation. According to Zheng Chengqing, the Bureau's expenses have indeed increased after changing to automatic telephones, but this is due to the Bureau increasing its assets, and businesses cannot be forced to bear the burden.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Accusation of Soviet Aid Association Employee is Purely International Politics <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Association employee unable to fulfill major tasks</p>
<p>Fearing being killed upon returning to his country, he fled to Hankou, leading to the association's lawsuit</p>
<p>Alexander Maurisson, a Russian and the director of the chemical supplies department of the Soviet Aid Association at 2 Beijing Road, was recently sued by the association's manager, Maierkov, for embezzling 25,000 yuan. The First Special Court has already acquitted Maurisson. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, the occurrence of this case has a political background. At the time, neither party mentioned it, so it was impossible to record. Now, after several days of investigation by the reporter, the truth of this case has been largely clarified. The facts are recorded below.</p>
<p>It is found that the Soviet Aid Association is nominally the general agency for Soviet trade in China, but in reality, it is the Chinese branch of the Political Defense Bureau of Moscow in the Soviet Union. It investigates all important political matters and also engages in commerce. In January of last year, Maurisson was appointed by the Economic Department of the Russian Political Defense Bureau as the director of the chemical supplies department of the association. He actually had a major mission, which was divided into the following points: (1) Investigate the political and economic situation of the whole of China, especially paying attention to Jiangsu Province. (2) Investigate the current situation of the Kuomintang, the number of party members, and its economic situation. (3) How many times did Wang Jingwei, the president of the Executive Yuan of our country, come to Shanghai, where did he live, who was responsible for his protection, how many Chinese and Western patrolmen were there, where did he eat, and who prepared the food? Because the Soviet Union hated Wang more than Chiang. (4) Investigate the internal conflicts of the central government and the Sino-Japanese issue, the conflicts and propositions of government personnel. (5) Investigate the Chinese who defected from the Communist Party and surrendered to the Kuomintang, and what kind of news they leaked, etc. However, after Mao came to Shanghai, he felt that he was being monitored and it was not easy to move around, so he failed to do his best to investigate the mission, which led to a reprimand from the National Defense Bureau. Maierkov was dispatched to Shanghai to work in place of Mao. After Mai came to Shanghai, he organized an active working committee, of which Mao was also a member. However, because Mao was under severe surveillance everywhere, he still failed to achieve any results, and his views differed from those of Mai. As a result, Mai wanted to send Mao back to Moscow. Mao, considering that there had been a case of Ge Lingfei, who was also sent back to Russia and then shot, did not dare to return to Russia, but he also did not dare to stay in Shanghai, so he secretly left Shanghai and went to Hankou to avoid his edge. Unexpectedly, Maierkov, fearing that he would divulge the secrets, sued him for embezzlement to stop his mouth. Mao heard about it in Hankou and immediately returned to Shanghai with lawyer Qiu Fenling to turn himself in. After the trial judge inquired and clarified, he acquitted him. However, the police stated that they still needed to consider whether to appeal, so he was ordered to post bail and be released during the appeal period. It is now heard that the police may withdraw the appeal. Whether this is true remains to be verified.</p>

<p>Purely a Murder Driven by Adultery and Revenge</p>
<p>Previous Reports of Robbery Were Inaccurate</p>
<p>The incident of the Sheng'an Steamer of the China-Foreign Steamer Company encountering a robbery and a massacre has been recorded in yesterday's news. After a thorough investigation by this reporter, it was learned that the facts were wrong. It was the Sheng'an Steamer of the Tianjin Zhidong Company, and it was a murder driven by revenge rather than a robbery. The truth of the matter is detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Sheng'an Transports Coal to Fujian <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Tianjin Zhidong Steamer Company was founded by Mr. Sheng Kunshan and has many seagoing vessels operating between Shanghai and various ports in North China. Last year, it purchased a new seagoing vessel with a capacity of 1,700 tons, which was named Sheng'an. Initially, no passenger seats were sold inside the ship. It was specially used to transport cargo for customers. This time, it loaded 1,600 tons of coal in Tianjin, which was to be directly transported to Fujian. It left Tianjin on the 26th, and a major tragedy occurred on the 28th.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Five Russians as Passengers <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The shipowner of the Sheng'an Steamer was a Russian named Vikmeng, and the first mate was also a Russian. When the ship set sail, it did not carry passengers as a rule. However, the shipowner had five acquaintances (also White Russians) who came to the ship and asked Vikmeng to allow them to travel to Fujian Province. The shipowner allowed them, breaking the rule, because he was on good terms with the five people. He allowed five passenger seats on the left and right of the shipowner's room to go to Fuzhou on the same ship.</p>

<p>When the Sheng'an Steamer sailed out of Dagu Port and reached Bohai Bay on the 28th, the five Russians who boarded the ship took advantage of the shipowner and first mate, A Shiliufu, etc., who were working, and unexpectedly drew their pistols and bombarded the two. After the shipowner and first mate were shot, they still blew the whistle, and the first mate's wife heard the sound and came out to see what was happening, and she was also shot and killed. At that time, there were four Chinese helmsmen, one Chinese steward, and one wireless telegraphy trainee inside the ship. They heard the whistle and went to the shipowner's room to see what was happening, but the five murderers each fired their pistols and killed the seven crew members, including the helmsmen, steward, and wireless telegraphy trainee.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Murderers Confessed to the Assassination <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The five murderers, seeing that the shipowner, first mate, etc., had been killed and the purpose had been achieved, declared to the second mate, the engineers, and all the crew members on the ship that the shipowner and first mate had a great hatred for them. The cause was due to a rivalry for love. Today's murder was entirely to avenge personal grievances and had no other purpose. As for the killing of the helmsmen and steward, it was because they interfered and helped the shipowner, so they were killed together. They ordered everyone not to be afraid. After the statement, they ordered the sailors to throw the ten corpses of the shipowner, etc., into the sea to destroy them.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Ship Ran Aground en Route <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>After the tragedy occurred, the shipowner was dead, and the responsibility for the entire ship was transferred to the second mate. At that time, after discussion with the crew members, it was decided to head to the nearest port. As a result, Dalian was the closest to the location, so they set off immediately. That night, the weather was very bad. When the Sheng'an Steamer was sailing in the Xingpu Sea area, it ran aground on a reef due to a mistaken navigation route. The bottom of the ship was broken by the reef and lost its ability to move. Therefore, the second mate decided to send a telegram to the head office for help, and at the same time, they tried to repair the hole on the ship and drain the accumulated water to prevent it from sinking.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Murderers Fled and Were Captured <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The five murderers took advantage of the ship's accident and each released a sampan to flee towards Dalian. After the crew members left the ship, they sent a telegram to Dehang to report the tragedy of the shipowner's murder. Later, it was heard that after the five murderers arrived in Dalian, three of them had been arrested by the Japanese police, and two were still at large and were still being searched for. Zhidong Company received the report and immediately telegraphed the Dalian branch to first send a tugboat with workers and pumps to Xingpu to tow and rescue the Sheng'an Steamer. According to the person in charge of the company, the murderers were indeed Russians, and it was purely a murder driven by adultery and revenge. Now that the Sheng'an has run aground, it is hoped that it can be pulled out. Tianjin Dehang will separately appoint a shipowner and first mate to the ship to investigate the murderers. There were no other passengers on board. In addition to coal, no other cargo was loaded.</p>

<p>The Xin Xin No. 1 Textile Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, cancelled the bonus pay the day before yesterday, which caused a strike by all the workers in the factory. Later, through the mediation of party and government representatives and the head of the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, a compromise solution was proposed, and the turmoil temporarily subsided. Recently, the factory announced that the bonus pay would be firmly cancelled starting from June. All the workers in the factory believe that the factory has accepted the mediator's method before, so how can it renege afterwards? The Tenth District Cotton Textile Union specially convened a general meeting of all representatives yesterday and decided that the bonus pay issue would not be stopped until the goal was achieved. Fan Luquan was dismissed by the factory for no reason, and the factory was required to reinstate him as soon as possible. More than 100 cadres of various departments in the factory were assigned yesterday, and each person was issued a badge. The internal organization was very sound, and they vowed to fight to the end.</p>

<h3 id="e199">A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Medicine and Pharmacy in the Last Decade (Continued) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Administration of Medicine and Pharmacy</p>
<p>Section 2: Names and Organizations in the Medical and Pharmaceutical Fields</p>
<p>Besides these are the learned societies. Currently, the headquarters of two major societies are in Shanghai: the Chinese Medical Association and the Medical and Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China. There was also the former "Bo Yi Hui" (Medical Society), organized by Western missionaries and Chinese people, which has now been merged into the Chinese Medical Association. Originally, the nature of a learned society is different from that of a guild; the former is an academic institution, while the latter is a professional organization. However, in reality, before the establishment of a physicians' guild, all external negotiations and internal self-governance of the medical community relied on the unity of these two learned societies. Furthermore, physicians' guilds have the nature of local units. If a place has a small number of people and cannot establish a guild, they can still enjoy the rights of the learned society's headquarters. Therefore, learned societies have always had connections with medical administration. In my opinion, in the near future, there will inevitably be a grand alliance of various medical societies, with one part discussing medicine and another part studying medical administration and business.</p>
<p>In the field of new pharmaceuticals, initially, there was simply no specific name because China had no specialized pharmacy discipline. It was only after the graduates of pharmaceutical schools appeared that the term "pharmacist" gradually emerged. However, their numbers were small, and no independent organization was established. Therefore, most of the talents in the pharmaceutical field were members of the Medical and Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China. Later, it was felt that the trend of the times dictated that medicine and pharmacy should be separated. Therefore, most of the members voluntarily formed the Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China. In addition to the learned society, a pharmacists' guild has recently been established, as well as a so-called New Pharmaceutical Society. The details are not very clear.</p>
<p>In terms of pharmacies and merchants, there is a New Pharmaceutical Industry Guild, which was advocated by Mr. Huang Chujiu in those years. Although it was not possible to get all pharmacies to join at the time, it was a very good form of unity. Among the pharmacies, there were also some apprentice-trained dispensing pharmacists who, motivated by a strict order from the Ministry of Health, voluntarily organized a Dispensing Pharmacists' Guild, which was unrelated to both pharmacy merchants and pharmacy academics. In fact, they can be called necessary pharmaceutical workers.</p>
<p>In the field of traditional medicine, the earliest organization was called the Shenzhou Medical and Pharmaceutical Society, which was established by Mr. Li Pingshu in Japan. He once served as its president. The nature of this society was also a mix of learned society and guild. Now, the most fashionable organization is called the Guoyi Guan (National Medicine Hall), and its tone is grand. Firstly, its birthplace is the Central Party Headquarters, not an organization voluntarily formed by doctors. Secondly, it has the support of important figures, so its nature is like a research institute, and also like a general association of old medical societies; and also like a university. Recently, it has also wanted to seize the right to manage the practice of old medicine, which makes it seem like the Ministry of Interior's Department of Health. Unfortunately, this almighty Guoyi Guan does not form a cohesive whole with the original old medical organizations, so that its almightiness is equal to its ineffectiveness, and it does nothing. There was originally no independent discipline in the field of old medicine, only drug merchants, so there was no academic unity, only commercial guilds, which are the trade associations of traditional Chinese medicine shops and old medicine merchants. Although shop assistants and old stewards (i.e., pharmaceutical manufacturers) did not have a guild, they had a labor union. I remember that there was a strike over the issue of wage increases the year before last, and pharmacies also went on strike.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Discussion on Pulse Diagnosis at the Cun Kou (3) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>(6) The section on the two sides within the "chi" in the Su Wen cannot be grafted onto the Cun Kou pulse method</p>
<p>In the "Pulse Essence and Subtle Theory" of the Su Wen, there is a section that says: "The two sides within the chi are the hypochondria. The outer chi is used to observe the kidneys, the inner chi is used to observe the abdomen. The middle part is attached above. The outer left is used to observe the liver, the inner to observe the diaphragm. The outer right is used to observe the stomach, the inner to observe the spleen, attached above. The outer right is used to observe the lungs, the inner to observe the chest. The outer left is used to observe the heart, the inner to observe the Tan Zhong. The front is used to observe the front, the back is used to observe the back. The top of the upper part concerns the chest and throat. The bottom of the lower part concerns the lower abdomen, waist, thighs, knees, shins, and feet." This section of text seems close to the Cun Kou pulse method. After the Jin and Yuan dynasties, the trend of reviving ancient ways was very strong, so the people of the Ming Dynasty all attached the section of text from the Su Wen to the Cun Kou pulse method, believing it to be the legitimate lineage passed down from the Yellow Emperor and Qibo. However, no one has ever been able to explain this section of text clearly. It says both "the two sides within the chi" and "the inner and outer chi." What exactly do the words "inner" and "outer" mean? Wang Qixuan, Yang Shangshan, Ma Xuantai, Zhang Yinan, and others all said that they are the two sides of the pulse. Wang Xingu, Li Zhongzi, Zhang Jingyue, Xue Shengbai, and others all said that they are the upper and lower halves of each part. The Medical Sect Golden Mirror refutes their claims, saying: "The pulse image is unified, not in two strips, nor in two sections." This statement is certainly a good refutation. However, his own claim that inner and outer are floating and sinking is wrong. He says that the pulse image is unified, but he does not think that dividing it into the cun, guan, and chi sections has already turned it into three sections. If pure sinking can be diagnosed in each place, wouldn't it become two layers again? What is he still talking about the unified pulse image? Isn't this contradicting himself? Therefore, Liao Ping of Sichuan believed that this section of text in the Su Wen was wrong no matter how he thought about it, so he changed the character "chi" to the character "foot," saying that it refers to the three parts and nine positions of the whole body, not the three parts and nine positions of the Cun Kou pulse method. Although Mr. Liao's saying is not necessarily the true meaning of the Su Wen, it shows that it is impossible to graft this section of text from the Su Wen onto the pulse method of the three parts and nine positions of the Cun Kou. The old doctors of today like to use this section of text as a talisman for the Cun Kou pulse method, saying that it is the proper method of the Yellow Emperor and Qibo. This kind of error is due to not studying ancient books carefully. They should be asked to read books behind closed doors for a few more years.</p>
<p>(7) The opinions of various people on the division of the viscera and bowels are different, and it is impossible to tell who is right and who is wrong</p>
<p>There are two major schools of thought on the pulse method of dividing the Cun Kou to observe the viscera. Before the Ming Dynasty, most people followed the words of the Pulse Classic. After the Ming Dynasty, most people grafted on the sayings of the Su Wen. However, there are many different opinions among them. For example, Chu Yong in "Dispelling Doubts" quoted the words of Chu Cheng's "Honoring Life Classic," saying that Yongzi's right chi is the Mingmen, the right guan is the spleen, the right cun is the lung, the left chi is the kidney, the left guan is the liver, the left cun is the heart; for women, the left cun is the Mingmen, the left guan is the spleen, the left chi is the lung, the right cun is the kidney, the left guan is the liver, and the right chi is the heart. The Pulse Classic says that the left belongs to the kidney, and the right is the Zihu, called the Sanjiao. Hua Boren said that the left chi is the kidney, bladder, and Mingmen, the right chi is the Sanjiao and pericardium. Zhu Danxi said that the left chi is the kidney and bladder, and the right chi is the Mingmen and Sanjiao; Li Shimai said that the left chi is the kidney and bladder, and the right chi is the kidney and large intestine; Li Yan said that the Mingmen is on the left for men and on the right for women; Xu Chunfu said that the left chi diagnoses the small intestine and bladder, and the right chi diagnoses the large intestine; Yu Jiayan said that the small intestine should be observed on the right chi, and the large intestine should be observed on the left chi; Zhang Jingyue said that the left cun observes the heart and pericardium, the right cun observes the lungs and Zhongshu, the left chi observes the kidney, bladder, and large intestine, and the right chi observes the kidney, Sanjiao, Mingmen, and small intestine; Chen Wuzhi said that the viscera observe external affections, and the bowels observe internal injuries; Li Dongyuan said that the left governs external affections, and the right governs internal injuries. Looking at the claims of the various families mentioned above, almost no one has the same opinion. If there is right and wrong, A argues with B. Whose words are correct in the end? Therefore, Chen Xiuyuan was at a loss and randomly listed the words of the Su Wen, Wang Shenghe, Li Binhu, and Zhang Jingyue, saying that they all made sense and could only be used together. Ladies and gentlemen, please think about it. There is only one truth. How can the learning of each family be compatible and inclusive? Is it possible to adopt an ambiguous, gray attitude of mixing right and wrong? Can this kind of technique be really applied to diagnosing diseases and be able to recognize the true face of the disease? It is truly confused and ridiculous!</p>
<p>(8) Old doctors say that the beating of the pulse is all "qi"</p>
<p>The "Ordinary People's Qi Image Theory" of the Su Wen says: "The major Luo of the stomach is called the Xu Li, which runs through the diaphragm and connects with the lungs, emerging below the left breast. Its movement responds to clothing. It is the source of the pulse qi." The thing inside under the left breast is the tip of the heart. Its beating is the beating of the heart, which is the driving force of all arterial pulsations. Saying that it is "the source of the pulse" is correct. Saying that it is "qi" is wrong. Saying that it is "the major Luo of the stomach" is even more wrong. Roughly speaking, the ancients thought that the beating of the pulse was all qi. I can use the words of the "Fifty Ying" of the Ling Shu to prove it. It says, "When a person exhales, the pulse beats twice, and the qi travels three inches. When a person inhales, the pulse also beats twice, and the qi travels three inches. When breathing is stable, the pulse travels six inches... After two hundred and seventy breaths, it travels sixteen zhang and two chi... Around the body, two ke of water fall... After thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, the qi travels fifty ying in the body." This is the evidence that the ancients mistook the beating of the pulse for the flow of qi. Even now, your country's doctors still regard the pulse as qi. For example, Li Binhu, he already knows that the pulse of the Cun Kou is not the location of the viscera, but he still regards the pulse as the qi of the viscera. Other doctors also have the same view. Isn't that a big mistake?</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Entrance Examination System and Students' Health Problems <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>In the past, I published an article entitled "Education and Health," stating that the current education system is very harmful to the health of young people. For example, too many exams, too much curriculum, poor diet, and cramped living conditions are all related to the health of students. Therefore, neurasthenia has become a prevalent disease in schools. This is nothing more than the exams and curriculum not being appropriate. Medicine and education are deeply related. When it comes to health, doctors have a responsibility to speak out. I would like to use this idea to discuss today's entrance examination system. Exams are the most burdensome thing in a student's life, and this is especially true in our country. There are exams every ten days, exams every month, exams every semester, and exams upon graduation. Almost half of the time in a year is spent on exams, and almost half of the students' bodies are injured due to too many exams. The graduation exam is especially bad. The need to improve the examination system is undeniable. Now, please let me talk about the relationship between the entrance examination and health as follows:</p>
<p>First, the overcrowding of people in the city.</p>
<p>Holding graduation exams in the heat of summer or the cold of winter is already detrimental to the health of children. However, it is difficult to change the established rules, and at the time of the exam, it is only one school, and the number of students is not too large, which is still acceptable. Now, the schools in the area are gathered together in one hall, and the poor air quality and cramped buildings are self-evident. In addition, among the students, not all of them are completely healthy. Some have not recovered from their illnesses, and some have infectious diseases that have not passed the infectious period (such as diphtheria and scarlet fever). All of them have to come because of the entrance examination, and the spread of germs is about to break out. The more people there are, the more the infection spreads. How can the danger be measured? This is one.</p>
<p>Second, the hardship of traveling back and forth.</p>
<p>The entrance examination means that students from various schools are gathered in one place. If there is a gathering place, then there is a difference between the distance between the students and the examination hall. It goes without saying for those who are close, but those who are far away have to run around in the scorching sun. Can middle school students who are not yet adults bear this? Moreover, the examination period is not just one day; what is examined in a day is not just one time. The journey back and forth is enough to exhaust them, and as for diet, there is even no way to take it into account! This is two.</p>
<p>Third, the schools are opening up fast trains.</p>
<p>Schools that have always advocated laissez-faire will inevitably be at a loss when they suddenly hear the order for the entrance examination, and they will have no way to hide their clumsiness. If the school authorities want to maintain the school's reputation, then it is difficult to take care of the students' suffering. They have no choice but to think of the next best thing, which is to speed up the curriculum and open up the fast train without stopping, regardless of whether the students can accept it. Students who have received laissez-faire education on weekdays are now subjected to coercive measures. Those who are eager to win will forget to eat and sleep, while those who are timid will become lazy due to fear. Since the clear order for the entrance examination was issued, the number of middle and primary school students who have contracted neurasthenia due to excessive study has increased day by day. This is three.</p>
<p>The above is just a rough outline. As for other things that are not related to health, such as teachers privately stealing exam questions with students, students cheating on the spot, and the larger the scope, the more the disadvantages. With health as the center of education, is this not what the education authorities of this city have been proclaiming to us? However, on the one hand, they talk about children's health in order to achieve healthy education, while on the other hand, they carry out the entrance examination system, which is a government policy that destroys children's health, and they are afraid that it will not be carried out. Is there any contradiction greater than this? Therefore, I am not surprised that this kind of government order was issued, but I am surprised that it was issued at a time when the world is promoting healthy education, and the central health authorities have no objection. I am not surprised that this kind of government order can be implemented, but I am surprised that the first place to implement it is the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, which takes health as the center of education, and the municipal health authorities also have no objection. Therefore, I would like to express my views briefly for those who are concerned about this issue to read!</p>
<h3 id="e202">Scientific Methods of Nurturing Life (23) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(19) Health Preservation During Childbirth</p>
<p>(A) The Necessity of Hygiene</p>
<p>After childbirth, when you are at ease and have nothing to do, you should rest your mind and recuperate. No matter what, you must take hygiene as the premise. The six-week postpartum period requires considerable health preservation, which is actually more important than the ten months of pregnancy.</p>
<p>If you do not take care of your health during childbirth, it often leads to unfortunate consequences, and it is easy to ruin your life. For example, puerperal fever, uterine retroversion, infertility, endometritis, salpingitis, and other diseases are mostly caused by unhygienic conditions, especially puerperal fever, which is very easy to occur.</p>
<p>(B) Body Cleansing</p>
<p>During childbirth, there is night sweat secretion, messy juice overflow, underarm staining, and lochia discharge. Therefore, the whole body is unclean. In addition to local washing within the possible range, you must wait four weeks before taking a bath to seek complete cleanliness. Clothes and bedding must be loose, clean, and soft. Pads and mattresses should also be soft and warm, and should be replaced and washed frequently. The room should have sufficient light and air circulation, and direct sunlight and direct ventilation should be prevented. Also, the filth of lochia, the cleaning of bedpans, the cleaning of furniture, and the cleaning of the four corners should all be kept as clean as possible.</p>
<p>(C) Bowel Movements and Urination</p>
<p>It is often easy to become constipated after childbirth. This is because the function of intestinal peristalsis is slow and the internal pressure of the intestinal cavity decreases. Although constipation for three days after childbirth is not a major problem, prolonged constipation is harmful to the mind and body. A gentle laxative method should be used. Enemas with warm water, soapy water, or glycerin can be used first. If it is still ineffective, then laxatives such as Glauber's salt, magnesium sulfate, or castor oil can be administered. However, rhubarb should not be used because it can be transferred to breast milk.</p>
<p>Urination is generally difficult after childbirth. Excessive bladder filling hinders uterine contraction, so urination should not be accumulated for too long. If there is no urination within six hours, warm, moist cloths can be applied to the bladder area. Or massage and compress the bladder area, or use sterilized cold water to irrigate the urethral opening in order to promote the urge to urinate. If it is still ineffective, then use a catheter to perform catheterization, but all sterilization should be even more rigorous than usual, otherwise lochia will enter the bladder and you will suffer a lot!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Common Sense About Diseases: Questions and Answers <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(9) Cholera (Vomiting and Diarrhea Epidemic)</p>
<p>Q: What methods can be used to treat cramps in the calf and thigh muscles? A: Warm, moist cloths can be applied to the area, or chloroform oil can be used for rubbing. Alcohol can also be used for rubbing.</p>
<p>Q: What are the prevention methods for cholera?</p>
<p>A: Isolate patients, suspected patients, and carriers. All patient utensils and excreta must be disinfected. Be careful not to eat food and drinks sold on the street, drive away flies, and be careful with your diet to avoid harming your stomach and intestines. Inject cholera prevention vaccine. Q: What is the so-called "epidemic prevention injection" and how is it injected? A: It is the cholera vaccine, which should be injected at the beginning of summer. It is generally divided into three injections: the first injection is 500 million dead bacteria, and the second and third injections are both 1 billion. Inject once a week to enable the body to develop the ability to resist bacteria. However, what is commonly injected now is a mixed vaccine for cholera and typhoid fever, which is also divided into three injections. The first injection is half a cc (1 billion dead cholera bacteria and 250 million dead typhoid bacteria), and the second injection is 1 cc.</p>
<p>(10) Intestinal Fever (Typhoid Fever) (Part 1)</p>
<p>Q: How does intestinal fever start?</p>
<p>A: Intestinal fever is typhoid fever. It is caused by eating unclean food containing typhoid bacteria.</p>
<p>Q: What is the Western name for intestinal fever?</p>
<p>A: The English name is Typhoid fever, the German name is Unterleibtyphus, and the Latin name is Typhus Abdominalis.</p>
<p>Q: Who discovered this pathogen and what is its morphology?</p>
<p>A: It was discovered by Mr. Eberth and Mr. Gaffky. The morphology is a rod-shaped bacterium, the length of which is about one-third of the diameter of a red blood cell. The ends of the bacteria have flagella and can move.</p>
<p>Q: After the pathogens enter the intestine, what changes occur in which part?</p>
<p>A: They occupy and reproduce in the small intestine. At first, the intestinal tube is congested and swollen, then it becomes necrotic and forms scabs. Finally, the scabs fall off and form ulcers, and eventually scars form and it heals.</p>
<p>Q: After the pathogen of intestinal fever is transmitted, how many days does it take to develop the disease?</p>
<p>A: It takes one week to three weeks of incubation before the disease develops after infection.</p>
<p>Q: How does the onset of the disease begin?</p>
<p>A: It starts with prodromal symptoms, which are general malaise, loss of appetite, and pain in the limbs. The body feels chills, and then fever develops.</p>
<p>Q: What happens after that?</p>
<p>A: The entire course of intestinal fever can be divided into four stages: the initial stage, the extreme stage, the relaxation stage, and the remission stage. Each stage lasts for one week, for a total of four weeks.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the initial stage?</p>
<p>A: The symptoms at this time are more obvious than those mentioned above. The fever rises daily, like a ladder, decreasing in the morning and increasing in the evening, but on average, each morning and evening is half a degree or one degree higher than the previous day. The highest temperature is reached on the fifth to seventh day. The tongue is dry and covered with thick fur, the pulse is repetitive, and there is constipation or diarrhea. In addition, due to the swelling of the spleen, there is pain in the left hypochondriac region, and roseola red spots appear on the skin of the chest and abdomen. Q: What are the symptoms of the extreme stage?</p>
<p>A: By the time of the extreme stage, the systemic symptoms increase, and the body temperature remains at a high fever of 39 or 40 degrees Celsius, with a difference of less than one degree between morning and evening (called sustained fever). The pulse is frequent, but it does not parallel the fever. In addition, the abdomen is full (bloating), there is rumbling in the ileocecal region, and there is tenderness to pressure, and the spleen is obviously swollen. The face has a dull appearance; it is trapped in drowsiness and coma, and delirium occurs from time to time. There is often a cough.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the relaxation stage?</p>
<p>A: The temperature begins to show a high and low relaxation state. The degree is gradually clear. At the end of this stage, the roseola completely disappears, and miliaria (commonly known as "white deafness") appears. The tongue coating peels off and there is some appetite. In severe patients, complications of heart failure are the most dangerous, especially intestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, or catarrhal pneumonia.</p>
<p>Q: Are these complications fatal?</p>
<p>A: Yes. The death of intestinal fever patients is mostly due to several complications at this time.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the remission stage?</p>
<p>A: The relaxation state of the temperature in this stage is even more obvious, with a difference of more than two degrees between morning and evening. Finally, it becomes intermittent and decreases in a scattered state. The swelling of the spleen and bloating disappear, and it enters the recovery period. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e204">New Explanation of "Paralysis and Abdominal Distension" (3) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(2) Abdominal Distension</p>
<p>The mention of abdominal distension inevitably brings to mind what we call ascites. I believe it can almost entirely represent ascites. Its causes generally fall into the following three categories: (1) it is one of the local symptoms of impaired blood circulation in the lungs due to heart disease; (2) it is a result of edema caused by nephritis; (3) it is caused by impaired portal blood flow, leading to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, mostly due to liver diseases. Atrophic cirrhosis and liver syphilis are the most prominent examples. In addition, various diseases of the peritoneum can sometimes occur, with tuberculous peritonitis being a good example. Ovarian hydrops in women can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from ascites, and it is naturally included in abdominal distension. People generally believe that there are two types of abdominal distension: fluid distension and gas distension. The former refers to ascites, while the latter refers to any abdominal distension caused by gas accumulation in the abdomen. There are many examples of this type, such as tuberculous peritonitis, which can resemble it when exudate solidifies into connective tissue. Children with intestinal parasitic infections can also exhibit this symptom.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the generally recognized disease of abdominal distension can be attributed to the following conditions in our new medical understanding: atrophic cirrhosis, liver syphilis, ovarian hydrops, heart disease, nephritis, and tuberculous peritonitis. The specific symptoms of each disease will now be described separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Atrophic Cirrhosis</p>
<p>This condition initially manifests as digestive disorders, a feeling of pressure in the stomach, and occasional bloating in the abdomen. Later, the complexion gradually becomes pale and gray, with mild jaundice in the eyes. The liver initially appears enlarged but gradually shrinks, while the spleen becomes enlarged. The main symptoms are ascites and varicose veins in the abdomen, which are the basis for diagnosing this condition. This condition is often caused by chronic alcohol poisoning, but it is also not uncommon after acute infectious diseases. Treatment includes abstaining from alcohol and other stimulants. If syphilis or malaria is the underlying cause, specific treatments for those conditions can be used. Diuretics are essential, with mercury injections being effective. However, if ascites does not subside with continued injections, paracentesis can be used to drain the fluid. However, the distension is likely to recur after drainage, requiring multiple procedures to be effective. The prognosis for this condition is poor. Once the symptoms are fully apparent (ascites is present), the lifespan is generally no more than two to three years. The condition can sometimes be life-threatening due to massive hematemesis, similar to gastric ulcer.</p>
<p>(2) Liver Syphilis</p>
<p>This condition is one of the symptoms of tertiary syphilis. Rubber-like masses develop in the liver, ranging in size from millet grains to walnuts, white or reddish-gray in color, mostly on the surface of the liver, but also occasionally in the portal area. The symptoms resemble those of atrophic cirrhosis. There are generally no subjective symptoms. Ascites, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly are the most prominent features, similar to hypertrophic cirrhosis. However, there are occasional episodes of biliary colic-like pain, accompanied by hectic fever. Jaundice may also occur. The course of this condition is chronic, and the prognosis is poor. In addition to specific anti-syphilitic treatment, symptomatic treatment is the same as before.</p>
<p>(3) Ovarian Hydrops</p>
<p>This is one of the women's diseases. The external appearance of the abdomen is almost identical to ascites, with no specific subjective symptoms. Differentiation requires abdominal paracentesis to examine the fluid. The fluid in common ascites is mostly transparent, containing white blood cells, red blood cells, and a small amount of protein, with a specific gravity below 1.012. The fluid in this condition is darker, viscous, and contains columnar epithelial cells with cilia, sometimes with serous fluid. The protein content can reach 5%, and the specific gravity can be above 1.020. Treatment involves surgical excision, which can be curative. However, the prognosis is less favorable for those with serous fluid.</p>
<p>(4) Cardiac Edema</p>
<p>Chronic endocarditis causes congestion, leading to blood leakage and accumulation in tissues, resulting in edema. It initially appears in the feet and scrotum, and later presents as ascites and skin edema. It is also seen in hydropericardium. Patients experience difficulty breathing, are unable to lie supine, have reduced urine output, and sometimes exhibit proteinuria. In addition to digitalis preparations, diuretics are very helpful, and mercury preparations can also be used. For those with syphilitic origin, iodine-bismuth preparations can be injected. It is sometimes not difficult to reduce or eliminate ascites and skin edema in this condition. However, the underlying heart disease is difficult to cure completely. The prognosis is better for those caused by syphilis.</p>
<p>(5) Nephritis</p>
<p>This condition often occurs after acute infectious diseases such as scarlet fever and typhoid fever. The main symptom is decreased urine output, with a minimum of only 200 cubic centimeters (200 cc) per day. The urine is dark brown, cloudy, and contains a large amount of protein, red blood cells, white blood cells, renal epithelial tissue, and various types of casts. There are occasional symptoms of fever and tenderness in the kidney area. Edema initially appears around the eyes, gradually spreading to both feet, then to the scrotum, and finally to ascites, pleural effusion, and the whole body, unlike cardiac edema, which initially appears in both feet. The course of this condition generally leads to one of three outcomes: complete recovery, chronic nephritis, or death from uremia. Treatment initially requires abstaining from salt, and fluid intake must also be restricted. When edema has not subsided, consuming only milk is best, up to two liters per day. Diuretics should be used with caution, and mercury injections should be prohibited (to avoid excessive stimulation of the kidneys and intestines). Diaphoretics and radiant heat baths are best for reducing swelling. If this condition does not become chronic and the patient follows the doctor's instructions regarding diet during the treatment period, complete recovery is generally possible.</p>
<p>(6) Tuberculous Peritonitis</p>
<p>This condition is caused by the invasion of the peritoneum by tuberculosis bacteria. It is more common in children and adolescents. The changes can be miliary tuberculosis, mass formation, or ascites. The ascitic fluid is dark brown, serofibrinous, sometimes with bleeding or hemorrhagic purulent properties. The specific gravity is usually above 1.005, and the protein content is also high, which is different from liver diseases. The main symptoms are abdominal distension, abdominal wall rigidity, and abdominal tenderness. Occasional low-grade fever and poor appetite are also present. The course of this condition ranges from several months to several years. The prognosis is better than other forms of tuberculosis, with occasional complete cures. If diagnosis is difficult, peritoneal puncture can be performed. In addition to general tuberculosis treatment, applying Sapo Kallnus and using a sun lamp can also be effective. Because intestinal adhesion to the abdominal wall is common in this condition, paracentesis should be performed with caution. Surgical intervention is only suitable for exudative forms, but not when there is tuberculosis in the intestines or lungs, or when there is fever.</p>
<p>In addition to the above conditions, edematous and acute malignant beriberi, when edema gradually spreads throughout the body, are also generally regarded as abdominal distension. Even intestinal parasitic infections in children, when the abdomen is distended, are sometimes mistaken. However, these two conditions are easily distinguishable by doctors and are less likely to occur, so I will not elaborate further here!</p>
<p>Now I can answer the question of whether the prognosis for abdominal distension is good or bad! Of the conditions mentioned above, atrophic cirrhosis has the least hope, followed by liver syphilis. The other conditions are all very promising. There are many examples of cures. Take endocarditis as an example. It is undeniable that valvular insufficiency and stenosis cannot be cured, but systemic edema can be eliminated. Subjective symptoms can sometimes be absent. Even regarding recurrence, there is great hope as long as the patient takes proper care of themselves. It depends entirely on whether the patient has a deep understanding of their condition! Regarding the issue of draining ascites by paracentesis, many people are very dissatisfied because the distension recurs after drainage. We have never concealed the fact that this procedure is not a specific cure, but it is the only reliable way to eliminate ascites today and is a powerful resistance to portal blood flow disorders. If it is continued multiple times, there is still a glimmer of hope. I hope that everyone who reads this article should deeply understand this point. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e206">On "Examinations" <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>In various local examinations, some initially opposed them, while others had examination questions leaked temporarily, causing unrest. The root cause of all this is that the true way of examination was not understood.</p>
<p>There are many ways to conduct examinations. In a nutshell, it is to take the ancient methods as a model. Examination is an ancient method, and the essence of examination is to model the past. Let's examine it. The Shuowen Jiezi says: "Examination means old." This is a rotational definition, so it also says: "Old means examination." "Examination" is interpreted as "old," and "old" is interpreted as "examination," which is still the same thing. We need to think of another way. "Old" refers to adhering to old methods. This is my interpretation. Adhering to old methods means taking the ancient methods as a model. Later generations may say that I am engaging in far-fetched analogies with this kind of exegesis. But in the eyes of teachers and senior scholars, they will definitely sigh and say: "Elucidating the essence and revealing the subtle, Ma Rong and Zheng Xuan have been reborn. Xu Shen has found a kindred spirit, and my way is not alone." I am not boasting, but I am confident, because teachers, senior scholars, and modeling the past are three in one.</p>
<p>Enough small talk, let's get back to the main point. What are the ancient methods of examination? Rewards and punishments, nothing more. The combination of the two is perfect, and the separation of the two is harmful. They must be given equal importance. Intellectuals, whether ancient or modern, high or low, can be attracted with rewards and awed with punishments. When awed with punishments, intellectuals know what to avoid. When attracted with rewards, intellectuals know what to strive for. When the psychology of avoidance and striving merge, examinees will naturally obey examiners like water flows downhill, unstoppable. If only graduation or non-graduation is used as the standard, then graduation is not a reward, and there is no reward for graduation. Non-graduation is not a punishment, and there is no punishment for non-graduation. Therefore, there is no means of control over them, and there is no relationship of restraint. Because there are the same examinations as before, and the same graduation or non-graduation: what distinguishes this kind of examination from that kind of examination?</p>
<p>Old scholars often say that the examinations since the Republic of China only have the dregs of examination, and the essence of examination has been completely lost. The treatment of "epidemics" still requires the use of "ancient prescriptions."</p>
<p>When rituals are lost, we seek them in the countryside. I will offer this as a source of inspiration. Mixing vernacular with literary language, I will seek to integrate them. End of discussion on "examinations."</p>
<h3 id="e207">A Record of Petitioning for the Study of Classics <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In the west, there is a sage who sent a telegram to the whole country, advocating the restoration of classical studies to rectify people's hearts. In the south, there is another sage who proposed a motion, ordering the whole province to study the classics, at least six hours per week, in order to save the declining customs. Rectifying people's hearts and saving declining customs are both great achievements of a prosperous age. The common people respectfully follow the imperial decree and rejoice. They hurriedly put on their straw sandals and went to the west.</p>
<p>Common people: I heard that you are practicing benevolent governance. You are also a sage. I wish to be a subject of the sage.</p>
<p>Western Sage: Good, good, you can go and study the Four Books!</p>
<p>Common people: I don't know if I should study the Four Books after the Song Dynasty or the Four Books before the Song Dynasty?</p>
<p>Western Sage: Huh!</p>
<p>Common people: There were no Four Books before the Song Dynasty (the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean were just two chapters of the Book of Rites). Sage, the Great Learning in the Book of Rites is different from the current Great Learning.</p>
<p>Western Sage: Huh?</p>
<p>Common people: Sage, Cheng Yi said that his version of the Great Learning is good, Zhu Xi said that his version of the Great Learning is the best, and Wang Yangming said that he has an ancient version of the Great Learning to prove it. I don't know which one I should study?</p>
<p>Western Sage: Huh! Even I am confused about this. You don't have to study them.</p>
<p>The common people put on their straw sandals again and sailed south.</p>
<p>Common people: I heard that you are practicing benevolent governance. You are also a sage. I wish to be a subject of the sage.</p>
<p>Southern Sage: Good, good, you can go and study the Five Classics!</p>
<p>Common people: Kang Youwei wants to drag me to study the Gongyang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals. Zhang Taiyan wants to drag me to study the Zuo Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals. Huang Yizhou said that the Rites of Zhou is the sage's treasure. Pi Lumen said that studying the Book of Etiquette is the right path. Zhuang Cunyu said that the Book of Poetry should be based on the commentaries of the Qi, Lu, and Han schools. Hui Dingyu told me that I must believe the words of Mao Chang and Zheng Xuan. Which classic should I study?</p>
<p>Southern Sage: Huh? What are you saying?</p>
<p>Common people: Zhuang Cunyu and Liu Fenglu are grabbing Sun Yirang and Huang Yizhou by their queues. Dai Zhen and Gu Yanwu are grabbing Wang Yangming and Lu Jiuyuan by their collars. Zheng Kangcheng is arguing with He Xiu there. Liu Xin slapped the face of a Grand Tutor. Sage, they all have badges of great classics scholars on their bodies!</p>
<p>Southern Sage: Huh, what are you saying?</p>
<p>Common people: Sage, Confucius is angry there. He says: I have never seen any Five Classics or Six Classics, and I have never revised any Five Classics or Six Classics. There must be treacherous people impersonating my name, swindling and deceiving people. Little ones, you can attack them with drums!</p>
<p>Southern Sage: Huh! What are you saying? Even I am confused about this. You don't have to study them!</p>
<p>The common people wholeheartedly wanted to study the classics, but who knew that even the sages didn't know what to study? They had no choice but to put on their straw sandals and return to their hometown. This is precisely:</p>

<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>Fufu ran back, his face covered in sweat and oil, and he was furious. He squatted down and sat down, took off his white cloth short shirt that was half draped over his back, threw it onto the bench, frowned, and stared blankly, craning his neck.</p>
<p>"You always look like this, what did the bodhisattva say?" Mama Fufu said, squatting down, shaking Fufu's shoulders with her hands, pursing her shriveled cheeks, and widening her sunken eyes, waiting for his satisfactory answer. However, her chest, which was throbbing, already understood a bit. The "fortune slip" must have been mostly ominous, otherwise, Fufu would not have been so angry. After a while, Fufu threw away his cigarette butt and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"No! The locusts are going to open their mouths!"</p>
<p>"Who said that?"</p>
<p>"That's what the bodhisattva's 'fortune slip' said!"</p>
<p>Mama Fufu's face suddenly turned white, she pounded her thighs with both hands, and tears streamed down like a string of beads. Then, her throat choked, and she cried out, "My poor Fufu Grandpa!..." Fufu drew on the ground with his fingers, not saying a word.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a sudden commotion in the field outside. Mama Fufu automatically stopped crying, lifted the corner of her clothes to wipe her eyelids, and went out. She glimpsed the locusts in the sky to the northeast, flying in, covering the sky and the earth. Mama Fufu immediately knelt down and kowtowed dozens of times loudly. It was not until the locusts' large formation had flown over that she stood up trembling, muttering prayers: Mighty General Bodhisattva is efficacious, do not let the divine soldiers eat my rice crops. If the autumn harvest is good this year, I can sell more for a few more dollars. At the same time, she also remembered the locusts four years ago, which also went and returned, and finally ate up two or three hundred acres of rice crops in the surrounding area. It was from that year that the family's situation gradually became difficult, and she began to sell fields, incur debts, and pawn items. Now there were only eight or nine acres of land left. If there was another locust plague, then there would simply be only one way to die. Fufu Grandpa's burial in the winter, Fufu's marriage... These urgent matters that needed to be resolved naturally became even more impossible to hold!</p>
<p>She thought blankly, her eyes reddened, and tears almost burst out again. Fufu lit incense and candles in the hall, respectfully kowtowing and bowing.</p>
<p>One day, two days, five days, although the locusts flew in in groups, they did not open their mouths. Both Mama Fufu and Fufu had some smiles on their faces. All future terrifying fantasies were reduced a lot. Mr. Wang, who was teaching in the village ancestral hall in the back village, said that last night the Mighty General Bodhisattva descended to the altar, "The Divine Soldiers" had already crossed the river and went north, and would definitely not "collect food" in Jiangnan. So when Mama Fufu heard Mr. Wang's stern and resolute words, it seemed like a stone fell from her heart. The neighbors in the whole village also showed a confident look.</p>
<p>Crackle, crackle, crackle!</p>
<p>In the middle of the sixth day, "The Divine Soldiers" suddenly carried out the "food collection." Their battle line extended to more than twenty miles in a few minutes. Mama Fufu knelt straight on the field, her face like a dead person. Fufu ran out bare-chested, then ran back, shouting like crazy:</p>
<p>"It's all gone! Mighty General Bodhisattva!"</p>
<h3 id="e209">In the Carriage <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wei</p>
<p>Inside the carriage, there was only a chaotic, muddled, and boiling cacophony of voices.</p>
<p>With a strange gaze, I sneaked from this side to the end of that side, and then from the end of that side to here. I saw that in this warm, stuffy atmosphere, there were countless complex heads: long, square, round, flat, fat, thin. Each seemed to have lost its soul, moving and shaking aimlessly, just like the uneven waves of wheat ears in autumn, blown by the gentle breeze.</p>
<p>Waves of heads, noisy and continuous, waves of heads, almost made me dizzy.</p>
<p>But just as I lowered my eyelids, a sharp, coughing sound awakened me. I looked on with frightened eyes and heard a "thump." A thick, green, glue-like phlegm jumped from a dark, mysterious mouth with a row of golden teeth onto the carriage floor. The floor seemed to shudder in fear.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at this emerald green phlegm. But just as I was staring blankly, I saw an old, gray-covered shoe blocking my view, as if trying to destroy this phlegm. After a while, it dragged past. The phlegm then turned into a wide, thin white foam.</p>
<p>This white foam looked quietly at the black mouth from which it had just sprung, with a kind of terrible smile. At this time, the black mouth seemed to be returning its smile and slowly opened wider. But then, a dirty hand, holding a snow-white cigarette, lifelessly inserted it into the black lips. Then: a burst of smoke! I could no longer see the figures opposite. I only knew that waves of shameless smoke rings surrounded me, head and face, until, with the shriek of the whistle, I relied on my own strength to struggle out of a small gap and fall out.</p>
<p>Ah! These small figures in the carriage are what I will never forget about the ancient country of the East!</p>

<p>— JULES RENARD, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Photo Album (Continued)</p>
<p>Twenty-Five</p>
<p>When he was outside, Carrot Top whistled to show that he didn't care about anything. But as soon as he saw the Lepic family following behind him, his whistling stopped abruptly. This made him as sad as breaking a small, worthless whistle in his mouth.</p>
<p>But we must admit that she let him go when he just started to sob.</p>
<p>Twenty-Six</p>
<p>He served as the communication line between his father and mother. Mr. Lepic said to him:</p>
<p>"Carrot Top, this shirt is missing a button."</p>
<p>Carrot Top took the shirt to the Lepic family and said:</p>
<p>"Do I need you to order me around, clown?"</p>
<p>But she took out her sewing basket and sewed on the button.</p>
<p>Twenty-Seven</p>
<p>"If your father wasn't here," the Lepic family shouted, "You would have used a ruthless hand on me a long time ago. You have inserted this knife into my heart and knocked me over on the straw."</p>
<p>Twenty-Eight</p>
<p>"Wipe your nose," the Lepic family often said.</p>
<p>Carrot Top tirelessly wiped it with the edge of his handkerchief. If the handkerchief came apart, he would fold it up again.</p>
<p>Indeed, when he had a cold, the Lepic family put medicine on him, making him so dirty that even his sister Elestine and older brother Felix became jealous. But she specifically added to him:</p>
<p>"This is not so much a fault as it is a benefit. It can make the head clearer."</p>
<p>Twenty-Nine</p>
<p>Because Lepic had been teasing him all morning, Carrot Top couldn't help but say such a terrible thing: "Leave me alone, you stupid thing!"</p>
<p>After saying it, he immediately felt that the surrounding air had frozen, and there were two streams of hot springs in his eyes. He murmured that as long as Lepic made a gesture, he would scamper into the ground.</p>
<p>But Lepic looked at him for a long, long time, but didn't make that gesture.</p>
<p>Thirty</p>
<p>Sister Elestine is getting married soon. The Lepic family allowed him to walk with her fiancé under Carrot Top's supervision.</p>
<p>"Walk in front," she said, "You can jump and play as much as you want!"</p>
<p>Carrot Top walked in front of them, struggling to jump, hesitating. If he forgot to slow down, he could not help but hear some fleeting kisses.</p>
<p>He coughed.</p>
<p>This made him feel stimulated. Suddenly, in front of the village's crucifix, he took off his hat and threw it on the ground, trampled on it with his feet, and shouted:</p>
<p>"Will no one ever love me!"</p>
<p>Immediately, the Lepic family, whose ears were not deaf, stretched out her body from behind the wall, a terrible smile floating on her mouth.</p>
<p>So Carrot Top hurriedly added:</p>
<p>"Except for mom." (End of the manuscript)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Approves the Re-Filing of Last Year’s Grade-Compiled Students in Each College</p>
<p>After the Suspension of the Senior High School, Students Transfer and Teachers Retain Positions</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) Regarding the aftermath of Beiping University, Minister of Education Wang Shijie and Acting President Xu Songming used correspondence to agree on specific measures as follows: ㈠ After the suspension of the senior high school, it may be entrusted to the affiliated high school of Normal University or Kongde affiliated high school to handle when necessary. The original teachers will still teach the courses, and the Russian class students will be transferred to the School of Commerce to attend classes, and subsidies will be given as appropriate. ㈡ The university office will explain the reasons for the last year's recruited grade-compiled students and submit them for approval and filing. ㈢ The arrears of the closed colleges and universities will be handled by the ministry sending personnel to Ping to clear them together. The above measures provide temporary security for the rice bowls of the senior high school teachers, and the problem of students dropping out of school is also completely solved. The most difficult issue is the grade-compiled students recruited last year. The Ministry of Education had previously instructed that they should not be filed, but now there is room for change. After the university office states its reasons, it will submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval and filing. Various issues need to be implemented after Acting President Xu returns to Ping. Xu originally firmly refused to resume his position, but after Minister Wang Shijie earnestly persuaded him to stay, he has now dismissed his intention to resign. He may return to Ping in mid-July to resume his position.

<h3 id="e215">Anhui High School Graduation Joint Examination Disputes <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial High School Graduation Joint Examination had some twists and turns a few days ago, causing rumors. After the Education Department's earnest guidance, it proceeded smoothly. Yesterday, the Education Department received telegrams from Guangyi Middle School in Wuhu, the Third Girls' Middle School, Fifth Middle School in Fengyang, the Second Middle School in Shou County, the Eighth Middle School in Chuxian, Mingguang Middle School, Fuyang County Middle School, and the Provincial Fifth Girls' Middle School, all stating that the candidates were diligently preparing for the exam. Even in the provincial capital schools, as of the 25th, 134 students from the high and junior high schools of the six counties had gone to the Education Department to exchange for joint examination admission tickets, along with 89 students from the First Girls' Middle School, and a total of more than 320 students from the First Middle School, Guichi, Qingyang, Southeast and other seven middle schools.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the Anhui Provincial High School Joint Examination is divided into six districts and scheduled to be held separately from July 1st to 3rd. The students of various middle schools graduating in Huaining district initially borrowed reference test questions and gave them to the students of the First Girls' Middle School to read, which was considered inappropriate and a decision was made to strike. Afterwards, after the Education Department explained in various ways, and some people in the education sector mediated, many people signed up for the exam. However, when the exam was held on July 1st, a small number of students suddenly destroyed the joint examination venue. The Education Department is now planning to continue holding the exam and deal with the aftermath. It is heard that the background of this incident is complex, and the factional struggles in the Anhui education sector are currently fierce, and the joint examination disputes are a manifestation of the struggles between the various factions.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Ministry of Education Inspector Completes Inspection of Anhui Provincial Education <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent Chen Kezhong, Director of the Library, Tang Xifen, Gu Zhaoqing, and Dun Xin, among others, to observe education in Anhui Province. The first time was in early March, when five people set off to inspect the situation of higher education and general education. This newspaper has previously briefly reported on this. The second time, on April 7th, Tang Xifen set off to inspect the education in Shucheng, Tongcheng, Anqing, and northern Anhui. Gu Zhaoqing went to Anqing with the former Director of Education Zhu on April 13th, intending to go to Wangjiang, Qianshan, and other counties, but it was inconvenient due to rain. He returned to Wuhu on the 19th and inspected the education in Dangtu, Hexian, Hefei, Chaoxian, Xuancheng, and other places along the way. In the middle, he returned to Beijing once due to rain. Gu set off for the second time on June 3rd, and after completing the inspection of education in Datong, Guichi, Qingyang, Xiuning, and other places, he transferred to Hangzhou and returned to Beijing a few days ago. According to reports, Tang inspected the provinces and both sides of the Huai River during the two inspections, and Gu inspected central Anhui, southern Anhui, and the areas along the Yangtze River. The detailed situation of the inspection will be released in the inspection report in the future. Now, to put it simply, the secondary education teachers' colleges and middle schools in Anhui are generally well-scaled. The good ones are equal to those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, while the bad methods are outdated and need to be improved. There are eight vocational schools. The First Vocational School is relatively better, but most of them are not well managed, the equipment is insufficient, and they focus on theory, which is not much different from ordinary middle schools. This is the biggest problem. Compared with central Anhui and southern Anhui, the atmosphere in southern Anhui is better, and the people running schools are very enthusiastic. Hu Ziheng, the principal of the Second Middle School, has been running the school for 20 years. When he was about to hand over, the province still owed 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. He gave the remaining funds from previous years, 70,000 yuan, to the successor. He can manage and build without using special public funds, which is truly commendable. In addition, Hu Jiajian, the principal of the Fourth Middle School in Xuancheng, is also very enthusiastic. The teachers and staff of the school can donate to the library and purchase the Wanyou Library and Boy Scout firefighting equipment. The school's Boy Scouts also carried out firefighting, dispatched twice, and won the praise of the society. This is the situation of secondary education. The social education in the province is in its infancy, and there are not many mass schools. However, Director Wang of the Second Mass Education Museum in Wuhu can still work hard, and the quality and quantity of social education have been expanded, which has a great impact on the society. As for the local education situation, the local primary schools along the Yangtze River are not only inferior to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but also to Shandong and Hebei. Compared with the south and north of the Yangtze River, the funding in the north of the Yangtze River is worse, but the education is better than in the south of the Yangtze River. Hong, the Director of Education in Qingyang County along the Yangtze River, is quite capable of rectifying the situation. The schools do not owe salaries, and there are more than 10,000 yuan in savings for expansion expenses. The rest of the counties owe salaries for four or five months at most, and two or three months at least. The local education in each county did not have a fixed budget before. Now, the funds are being tightened and reorganized to clear the arrears. The situation of county education administration is generally better for those with directors, worse for counties with commissioners, and extremely bad in Huizhou. This is because the fourth section of the county has two directors, one in charge of construction and one in charge of education. In addition, there are no supervisors to urge administration, and this commissioner is not a person who has been running schools, so there is no way to improve education. The education funding in the province, the special tobacco tax is collected and managed by the government, and the government allocates 100,000 yuan per month, accounting for two-thirds of the provincial education funding. The funding is relatively stable, but the original temporary fee of 100,000 yuan is withdrawn from the provincial treasury and cancelled invisibly. All schools have regular expenses, but no temporary expenses, which greatly affects equipment construction.</p>

<p>Zhu Sen and Others Talk About the Results of the Investigation</p>
<p>(Telegram from Nanjing, 2nd) The Central Research Institute previously sent Meng Xianmin and others to investigate the geology of the Nanling Mountains. Recently, Zhu Sen and Li Yuyao have returned to Beijing and told reporters that the Tuojiang River in the Nanling Mountains can be used for water conservancy development. The mineral products in the Mengzhu Mountains and Xiaoshui River area, the tin sand in Linwu, and the stone in Qitian, as well as the coal in Qitian Yizhang, have not been mined due to geographical and human relations. A "Nanling Orogeny" was newly discovered in the Nanling Mountains. The orogeny is the orogeny between the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The paleobiological relics of the Nanling Mountains have fossils from the Silurian to the Jurassic periods, and most of them are detached from the parent rock and are extremely precious. In addition, many fossils from the end of the Tertiary period, millions of years ago, were found in the north of Guilin City.</p>

During these three years, almost not a single day has passed without me remembering this school in my mind. This school has gone through many hardships, and thanks to the efforts of my colleagues in the school, it has been able to progress day by day. My heart is filled with unspeakable gratitude. Now, under the order of the school board, I have returned to my position as principal. I will naturally uphold the original intention of founding this school and devote all my efforts to seek improvement. Education is our current inescapable cause. If we do not act with sincerity, we will not only mislead students, but also bring disaster to the nation. I sincerely hope that colleagues and students will recognize this meaning and support this smallest part of the work together, so that a drop of water can become a vast ocean, and it may not be a way to be loyal to the nation. After the speech, everyone cheered and dispersed.</p>

<p>To Compete with Shanghai Athletes</p>
<p>Basketball in North China has always been developed. In recent years, the technology has become more sophisticated. After the dispersal of the Nankai Five Tigers, Kailuan of Tianjin and Shida of Beiping have each established their own banner and competed for hegemony. China University has also risen strongly, defeating Shida and winning the Ping City Open Basketball Championship for two years. Now that Shida's fierce generals Liu Guanjun, Wang Yuzeng, Chen Sheng and others have graduated one after another, the title of Beiping's basketball leader has become none other than China University. Now the team plans to make an expedition to Shanghai during the summer vacation. They have already contacted Shanghai. If there is a team to fight, it can be done. The team is training very hard and will come to Shanghai no later than October. The team list is as follows: Jin Ke (captain), Shi Jue (manager), Duan Zhuo, Zhang Yucai, Wang Kanruo, Li Heding, Zhao Zhenlai.</p>

<p>丨Waseda Will Fight Amateur Team Again at Half Past Four Today丨</p>
<p>The Waseda and Macklin baseball teams fought again at the China Baseball Field yesterday. Because the sky was clear, the Eastern audience was more crowded. As a result, Macklin lost again 3 to 4. In the first inning, Waseda batted first. Macklin changed to a new pitcher, but he lacked experience and the ball was often inaccurate. Also, he made a huge mistake, allowing Waseda to score four points in a row. Then he immediately changed the pitcher and tried his best to cheer up. After that, there were many opportunities to win, but he finally lost miserably by one point. What a pity. This afternoon at 4:30, Waseda will fight the amateur team again at the China Baseball Field. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>

<p>French Davis Cup star Ke Xian defeated American youth Jones three to one, 6-4, 6-8, 8-6, 6-0. Jones is only twenty years old and is the Cambridge University tennis champion in England. Jones' serve is unique at Wimbledon. Several times, his serve was so swift and direct that it surpassed Tilden's cannonball serve in its golden age. After Ke Xian won the first set, Jones fought bravely in the second set for a long time and finally won it back. In the third set, Jones took a 4-1 lead, but Ke Xian was steady and calm, winning 8-6. In the final set, Jones was exhausted and completely defeated.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Automobile Club held a formal establishment meeting at Jing'an Temple at 9:00 a.m. yesterday and held an opening race for members. The president, Mr. Tang Guanyi, the vice president, Mr. Gibbings F.S. (represented by Mr. Young F.C.), and about twenty Chinese and Western members attended. Among them, the president and two young members, one being Mr. Tang's six-year-old son, Tang Deliang, and the other being Mr. Zhuo Yongshi's six-year-old son, Zhuo Shenkang, from the Shanghai Bank, one old and one young, actually rode bicycles to the venue, attracting the most attention from passersby. There was also a female member, Mrs. Anderson, who was already in her forties, happily adding a lot of color to the venue. After all the members gathered and took a photo in the courtyard of Jing'an Temple, the president issued an order to go to Beixinjing and meet in front of the Luo Biegen Hotel. The reporter took a seat in the car carrying the young members and the female member and took the lead to the Luo Biegen Hotel. Before long, all the members arrived one after another, and they entered to drink soda and rest. After about half an hour, they all returned along the original route. According to the report, because this race was a social event, the order in which members arrived at the destination was not recorded.</p>

<p>Nanshang 60 points, Huaguang 57 points</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day for the Nanyang Commercial High School and Huaguang Track and Field Team to compete. The track and field audience was about seven or eight hundred people. After one o'clock, they clashed. As a result, Nanyang Commercial High School scored three points more than Huaguang and took the silver cup. The score was 60 to 57. In terms of strength, Nanshang is good at short distances, and Huaguang is good at long-distance running. Each has its own strengths, so the competition was fierce from beginning to end. Wang Zhenglin's 3000 meters was easy and effortless. Song Ruirong's long jump of 6.69 meters was not bad. The pole vault results were too poor, and there were no good postures. Zhou Cheng's javelin originally had a strength of 44 meters, but yesterday the result was greatly reduced due to the hot weather. Others were just average. What is regrettable is that the order of the venue was too bad. The audience gathered, shouted, and laughed in the field. It was especially dangerous to run around when throwing the javelin, and there were too few officials maintaining order. This point should be paid attention to by those who compete later.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Education issued an order that schools should adopt a two-part system and a half-day system, various cities and counties are preparing to try it out in the next semester.</p>
<p>In fact, the two-part system and the half-day system will inevitably slightly discount the progress of children's studies.</p>
<p>I have long had an idea to open up a new path in addition to the two-part system and the half-day system. Now, taking this opportunity, I will first publish the outline of this idea here as a small suggestion.</p>
<p>(1) Mobile Classes in Urban Schools</p>
<p>(1) Use occasions such as large auditoriums, dining halls, sports grounds, campuses, specialized rooms, and empty classrooms when changing classrooms to recruit several classes with mobile teaching locations.</p>
<p>(2) The teachers in mobile classes should follow the principle of two classes and three teachers, taking turns to rest. From the time the children enter school to the time they are dismissed, there is always one person accompanying them in their activities.</p>
<p>(3) The children's activity time and curriculum are the same as those of ordinary classes.</p>
<p>(4) In principle, no office expenses are paid except for teachers' salaries.</p>
<p>(5) Each child should have a hardwood box that can store all used books and objects at ordinary times, and can be used as a short stool when there is no seat.</p>
<p>(2) Mobile Schools in Rural Areas</p>
<p>(1) There is no need for fixed school buildings, and empty houses such as the living rooms in children's homes and ancestral halls in the area are used as temporary teaching places. It is best to have the children's families take turns to provide these, and to implement outdoor teaching more often.</p>
<p>(2) Families who can take turns to provide the space are exempt from their children's tuition fees. (3) The income from tuition fees is used to purchase necessary school equipment. In principle, no office expenses are paid except for teachers' salaries.</p>
<p>(4) There are no fixed holidays. During busy farming seasons, teachers should tour around to guide children and assist their parents in their work.</p>
<p>(5) Because teachers are close to families, they can naturally take on the responsibility of popular education. The most popular books among the Chinese people are almanacs, and guiding adults to read can start from the almanac.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Blood and Money <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Blood is the most precious thing in the human body; without blood, one will wither and die. "Money" is also the most precious thing in life; without money, one will be poor and starve to death. In fact, it can also be said that money is blood, and blood is money. Poor people exchange sweat and blood for money, which is one example. There are also a few terms used by "Bai Xiang" people (Shanghai slang for loafers or gamblers): when there is a lot of money, it is called "blood is strong." Squeezing you for money is called "bleeding." Empty pockets are called "dry blood consumption." This is also clear proof that blood represents money.</p>
<p>Now that science is prosperous, the relationship between "blood and money" has become even closer. If a rich person loses blood and gets sick, they can pay a doctor to transfuse blood. Pumping A's blood into B's blood vessels will restore health. In European and American countries, there are strong poor people who often ask hospitals to sell their blood. In this way, the blood of the poor can be exchanged for the money of the rich. The money of the rich can be exchanged for the blood of the poor. With money, there is no fear of not having blood. A few days ago, the newspaper reported the news that "Duan Zhiquan's blood transfusion was healthy"; the blood he transfused was just the blood of his nephews and nieces. I think this trend is gradually opening up. If ordinary wealthy people are physically weak and suffer from anemia, they can turn danger into safety and prolong their lives. This is really a blessing for the rich.</p>
<p>I also have a plan; in prosperous cities, it is possible to open a real and authentic human blood company, hiring doctors to manage blood testing, blood transfusions, and other procedures. Collect the blood of the poor, preserve it scientifically, and sell it at a marked price so that it can be transfused into the noble bodies of the rich. It doesn't matter if the poor are thin, as long as the rich are fat. It is certain that business will flourish and the door will be like a market. Because the lives of the rich are the most important, with blood, there is no fear of Yama, the king of hell, sending an invitation. Buying and selling human blood, using each other for their own purposes, is a newly invented "way to make money" in the civilized world!</p>
<h3 id="e252">A Brief Discussion on the Various Names for Excrement <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Li Pengxiang</p>
<p>Defecation is something that everyone does every day. Although the matter is simple, the names are varied. Each name can represent each class. Now I will briefly discuss what I know, with some textual research in between, but I dare not have the heart of "covering" Mr. Hu Shih's "Lushan Travel Notes" with a lot of textual research.</p>
<p>Wash hands: Among these types of names, this can be considered the most elegant. Foreigners do not say "defecate," but say "wash hands." The English name is Wash Hands. Generally, "higher-class Chinese" use it a lot to show civilization.</p>
<p>Large release: In peacetime, this is not often called, except when Chinese and foreign doctors are treating patients. For example, asking: "Is the large release smooth?" "After eating these pills (or plasters), the large release may be smooth," etc. The sister term of "large release" is "small release." Release means to remove.</p>
<p>Climbing the pit: This name is said to have originated in the north and spread to the Jiangnan area. In the Beiping area, even in homes, they generally do not use what we call "chamber pots" here, because they think it is unhygienic. Everywhere there are rough toilets. This rough toilet, the so-called "pit," cannot be sat on, but can only be "climbed" (or squatted) to "excrete": hence the origin of this name. "Middle-class Chinese" like to call it this.</p>
<p>Going to the restroom: Among the former Qing scholars who generally grew their fingernails long, this "going to the restroom" occupied a large force. However, it is not known whether this "restroom" character is wrong. However, reading Mr. Chen Wangdao's book "An Introduction to Rhetoric," there is an entry on the rhetorical device of "inversion." Its definition is: what the speaker means in their mouth is completely opposite to what they mean in their heart, which is called "inversion." Then this so-called "restroom" is actually the "disrespect" that is in the heart. This can also be said to make sense.</p>
<p>Also, in Mr. Yu Dafu's "Nine Kinds of Diaries," page 4, there is the statement "The weather is very clear and crisp, when going out to the restroom..." After much textual research, I feel that there are generally no errors, so I will record it here for the contemporary sages to judge.</p>
<p>The most undesirable is to come up with the most vulgar and low-class "excrement." Generally, "illiterate" lower-class Chinese like to say "I'm going to excrete." and "Are you going to excrete? Let's go together." etc. nasty words. "Higher-class Chinese" cover their noses and pass by when they hear it. In this area, I am afraid that it will damage "face," so I will not discuss it in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Avoiding Water Ballad <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>For days on end, the sky is gloomy and the rain is heavy. The God of Waves is acting evil, the Shang Yang dance. The licentious water seeps and nourishes, the ditches and gullies are full, rushing to protect the embankments, the danger is especially near. Where does the gurgling sound come from? Hearing it, the alarm sounds and people tell each other. The water level of the Great River suddenly overflows. The lower reaches are submerged into courtyards and households. The wind and waves roar without a moment's rest. Avoiding water is like avoiding a tiger. The wall of the east family collapsed again. The western neighbor's mother calls out to her father. This is the year that is suffering from floods. Could it be that the disaster is a catastrophe? The rising tide continues to rise. Dragons and fish swallow each other. Alas, those water people have nowhere to live. It is truly like fish swimming in broken tiles. Moreover, a vast expanse of water. Drifting and moving home without oars. How can such flesh and blood endure the cold? The sight is so terrible that I can't bear to look at it. When you are about to be drowned and buried by fish, who says flood prevention and blocking? Alas, why is the heart not benevolent? Drought and waterlogged, crying and suffering. May I ask why the torrents come. The responsibility lies with the government. How can I get the heavens and Songyue to create a god of water management like Yu?</p>
<h3 id="e254">Envying Those Friends Who Sleep in the Open Air <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>A pillow of snores, comfortable and relaxed, this sleep is the most comfortable and enjoyable thing in life; it is also an indispensable page in the history of life.</p>
<p>The old boss in the Western-style house wants to sleep, and the poor devil in the pigeon loft also wants to sleep. When you fall asleep, poverty and wealth are the same, and joys and sorrows are equal. In the rich man's dream, he is kidnapped for ransom, the business he created fails, and the concubine runs away with someone. How can his spirit be at peace? In the poor man's dream, he wins a Champagne ticket: he gets the first prize in an airline ticket, although it is empty joy, he gets temporary joy. So sleeping is the most fair, impartial and unbiased thing. These days, the weather is so hot that there are friends in the pavilion room and the mezzanine floor who have the pain of wanting to sleep but not being able to. The day before yesterday, I went to Shanghai to see a friend. It was night, and I couldn't go back, so he let me stay there. I was used to the countryside, and when I arrived at the narrow and cramped house, it was as hot as a steamer. I couldn't fall asleep in bed, listening to it striking eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock. Later, the lights went out, and it seemed like a speck of dust fell on my face. When I touched it with my hand, it turned into something strangely smelly and soft, followed by my body and feet. I knew that the bedbugs were giving the order for a general attack. I held a non-resistance doctrine, quietly put on my clothes, and circled on the road. It was late at night, but a temporary open-air hotel was opened on the sidewalks on both sides. Some had a rattan chair; some had a wooden plank; some had spread a torn mat on the cement. Everyone was snoring loudly, and their dreams were sweet.</p>
<p>When I saw these people sleeping comfortably, it made me feel the pain of not being able to sleep. They have no bedbug attacks; no hot air steaming. Although it is said that the night is cold and the dew is easy to get sick, damn it, is it more likely to get sick if you are bitten by bedbugs and steamed by hot air? I was happy to get some sleep. My eyes were a little unsustainable: my feet were a little sore. Go back to sleep! How can I endure those bedbugs and hot air? I wish I could discuss it with the friends who sleep in the open air: "Hey! Friends, move aside a little and let me lie down!" But how can I do it in reality!</p>

<p>— Tu Chonglou</p>
<p>Although I live in a concession managed by foreigners, my residence is located in an area where my people gather, so every midnight, various sounds are freely transmitted to my bedroom along the road. "Clang," the iron gate of the X Mansion opened! "Whoosh," the motor of the car started.</p>
<p>"Rickshaw, British note? British note?" The maid of XX No. was calling in Yangzhou Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>"Damn it, don't get run over by a car!" A rickshaw puller grabbed the business, and the remaining rickshaw pullers cursed loudly like this.</p>
<p>"Sir! Madam! If there is any leftover tea and rice, give the poor a bite and a half bowl..." The sad tune came from the beggar's broken throat.</p>
<p>"The beauties of the Peach Blossom River are many, thousands of peach blossoms, not as many as beauties!..." The radio broadcast was much louder than the phonograph.</p>
<p>"Ahang, come back! Amao,..." This is the cry coming from the nearby alley. It is said that calling like this can call back the soul of a seriously ill child who is about to die?</p>
<p>"Dong dong" The sound of the wooden fish. The old monk in the deep white clouds also came to join in the fun in the prosperous city.</p>
<p>"Peng peng..." One machine bicycle after another drove by. "Woo woo..." One car after another drove by.</p>
<p>These noisy and chaotic sounds play in my ears every day. Although I hate them so much, they always surround me.</p>
<p>All the sounds of midnight! When will I be able to leave my ears forever?</p>

<p>Chapter Ten Hearing the Words, Fangxin Seals the Marquis, Wishful Thinking, Listening to the Song, Envious Colors, Report to the Country</p>
<p>Within half a month, Zhao Ziqiang had come home to see his father at least three times, but he had never met Guizhi once. The last time, he had heard Guizhi speaking, but when his leather shoes sounded all the way in the front yard, the voice inside suddenly stopped. Zhao Ziqiang saw this situation and felt a little strange. He thought to himself, is she tired of us? Because of this, the cough that he couldn't help but make every time he walked to the front yard was finally forced to suppress. After two or three days, Mrs. Huang Manying, who had come to Guizhi for matchmaking last time, came again. He talked with Zhao Weng very late, so he borrowed a room at the Yang family's house. When he was sleeping on the kang, he chatted with Jiang and talked about the recent situation in Beiping City, saying that Xidan Arch had now added a Xi'an Market, which was similar to Dong'an Market. He also said that in the theaters, there are now many places where men and women perform together. He also said that the people on the movies can now talk, and Chinese movies are speaking Mandarin. Sound movies are really interesting, even putting teacups on the table has sound. Guizhi listened, and couldn't help but be greatly moved, so she said to Jiang: Mom, when shall we go to Beijing City for a few days? Let me go and open my eyes. Jiang said: You said it well, go to the city to open your eyes, not to mention the money for buying tickets, we can't afford it, even these two meals and one sleep, there is no way. Huang Manying spoke at this time, he said with a smile: I can eat at your house when I come to Haidian, and I can sleep at your house. Can't you eat and sleep at our place when you go to the city? Guizhi said: We don't know anyone in your mansion, how can we bother you? Huang Manying said: What you said is even more wrong. When I first came here, I didn't know you and your daughter. Did you leave me to eat and sleep? If you two go to my house, I will lead you there, so it doesn't matter. (One hundred and eighteen)</p>

<h3 id="e257">The Physical Constitutions of Three Types of Women <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Recently, various countries have paid close attention to research on women's physical constitutions. Generally, women's physical constitutions can be divided into three types in terms of form: the weak type, the athletic type, and the obese type.</p>
<p>The weak type is what is known as the "willowy waist" constitution. The body is thin and long, the skeleton is weak, the neck and limbs are slender, the chest is flat, the skin appears pale, the muscles are relaxed, there is little subcutaneous fat, the muscles are underdeveloped, the body weight is very light, there is little tension throughout the body, and the person is often hunched over. This posture accounts for about 50 to 60 percent of women. The obese type is exactly the opposite of the previous type. The subcutaneous fat is very developed, the body is fat, and there is often the distress of being trapped in excessive fat, hindering the nutritional needs and supply relationships. The nutrients obtained every day are converted into fat. This type can be further divided into alimentary obesity and constitutional obesity. Alimentary obesity is caused by greedily eating more food than is necessary for nutrition, and doing nothing all day except eating. The nutrients obtained are rarely consumed, thus becoming inactive obesity. In other words, they are like pigs. Generally, women with this constitution have reduced reproductive function. Although they appear healthy on the outside, they are actually more prone to illness than thin and tall people.</p>
<p>The athletic type has well-developed bones and muscles. The muscle fiber tissue throughout the body is very tight, the skin is resilient, the shoulders are broad, and the chest is developed. This can be called a complete and beautiful physique. The above three types are only classified based on general appearance. However, when divided in detail, there are hundreds of different types due to each person's acquired and personal characteristics, family circumstances, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Bad Breath in Women <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Bad breath is most annoying, especially as a major obstacle to closeness between men and women. Love is often estranged by bad breath, and even a beautiful appearance is diminished by it. It is said that when Emperor Xuanzong of Tang first obtained Yang Guifei, he found her appearance indeed charming, but she had bad breath. Later, a court physician advised Guifei to eat more fresh lychees, and gradually the bad breath disappeared. Nowadays, in social circles, eight or nine out of ten women have bad breath. Most of these people are unaware of their problem. Even if someone points it out, they only use some chewing gum to temporarily mask it, without understanding the fundamental source of the problem. According to medical research, bad breath can be caused by diseases of the stomach, intestines, and respiratory system, which can be understood by breathing through the nose. However, in ordinary people, bad breath is mostly caused by tooth decay. To test for cavities, you can insert a toothpick into the tooth hole. If the toothpick smells bad, it can be determined that there are tooth worms at work in the tooth hole. Other causes include not rinsing the mouth after eating, which leads to food residue getting stuck in the teeth, decaying and fermenting, and a clear juice flowing out of the teeth, causing a foul odor. Or it may be caused by alveolar pyorrhea, where tartar accumulates on the teeth and decays, causing a foul odor. There is also a type of stomatitis that causes particularly bad breath. Therefore, for people with bad breath, the first thing to do is to treat the root of the tooth, the second is to immediately brush the mouth and clean the gaps between the teeth after each meal, and the third is to prepare a deodorant mouthwash, such as a thousand-fold solution of potassium permanganate or a five-fold solution of Oxyfull Person to brush the teeth and rinse the mouth with boric acid water. In that case, bad breath can be eliminated.</p>

<p>— Ms. Xu Zhongyang</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Hongkui of the Gaoqiao Seaside Hotel recently invited Mr. Lun Binqi, a swimming champion, to try out sea bathing at the beach. Those who accompanied him included Mr. Wang Weixin, Ms. Bao Lengxue, and myself, among others. We departed by boat at 10 a.m. and arrived at the Gaoqiao pier around 11 a.m. Then, we took a Liuhe Company rickshaw to the Seaside Hotel. Mr. Yang warmly welcomed us and led us on a tour. The new building had just been completed and was richly constructed. Although the sun was scorching hot, a cool breeze gently blew inside the building, which was refreshing. There were more than twenty rooms of various sizes inside, all equipped with modern amenities. A separate room was set aside for showers, especially for rinsing off after sea bathing. Behind the building were vegetable gardens and chicken coops, with many chickens and ducks. Next to the garden was a small pond filled with fish, and there was also a famous chef to provide travelers with delicious food. After lunch, we changed clothes and went to the beach to try out the sea bathing. The water was very warm, unlike pond water, and the white waves were enough to cleanse the body and mind. I was willing and happy to say: "If I could live in a watery town forever, then my wish would be fulfilled." Suddenly, a small red dot appeared from afar. Upon closer inspection, it was a rescue boat, prepared for tourists in case of unforeseen circumstances. We were very impressed with the facilities of the Meibin Hotel. After swimming for two hours, I began to feel tired, so I changed clothes and rested before returning.</p>

<h3 id="e260">Observing the Decline of the Cotton Industry from Cotton Industry Statistics <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>丨Including the Relationship to Rural Revitalization丨 Jiang Dixuan</p>
<p>Cotton is the agricultural product second only to rice and wheat in our country, and textiles are the largest industry in our country, so their rise and fall are closely related to people's livelihoods. In recent years, due to the insufficient price of cotton production, the textile industry has become increasingly depressed, and the import of cotton and cotton goods has increased accordingly. As a result, it directly and indirectly promotes the decline of rural areas. Please explain this.</p>
<p>Cotton goods are the main clothing raw materials in our country, and in the past, most of them relied on imports. Since the outbreak of the European War, the domestic modern textile industry has flourished, and the number of spindles has increased greatly. The import of cotton goods has not continued to increase, but the value still reaches 200 million taels. In recent years, tariffs have been increased repeatedly, and the textile industry seems to be developing again, but the situation is just the opposite. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, it has been declining, and it has become even worse in recent years. The yarn factory has recently reduced its work. The reason is that the yarn sales are sluggish, and the flowers Customes domestic cotton exceed</p>
<p>12th Year of the Republic 8,310,355 63,979,733</p>
<p>13th Year of the Republic 7,144,642 16,186,200</p>
<p>14th Year of the Republic 7,818,882 1,006,618</p>
<p>15th Year of the Republic 7,534,351 1,866,505</p>
<p>16th Year of the Republic 6,243,585 9,688,530</p>
<p>17th Year of the Republic 6,722,108 80,4580</p>
<p>18th Year of the Republic 7,748,366 1,571,000</p>
<p>19th Year of the Republic 8,809,567 2,630,949</p>
<p>20th Year of the Republic 6,399,780 3,862,864</p>
<p>21st Year of the Republic 8,105,637 3,049,592</p>
<p>Cheap yarn is very expensive, especially zero. Let's examine the recent market prices of standard yarn flowers. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the average high and low price for the whole year was 162.70 taels for standard yarn and 32.60 taels for standard cotton. In May of this year, the price of standard yarn was 122.40 taels, and the price of standard cotton was 30.20 taels. (The standard grade of this year has been recalculated to be equal to that of the 18th year of the Republic of China.) Compared with each other, the yarn has fallen by 40 taels this year, and the flowers have fallen by 2 taels and 5 cents. With such a depreciation rate, the business of spinning mills can be known. The reason for the cheap yarn is due to the sale. The reason for the high price of flowers is due to the lack of cotton production. Cotton production in our country cannot meet the demand. It began in the 8th year of the Republic of China. The cotton Customs Chao started in the 8th year of the Republic of China. After that, the number of spindles increased, and cotton sales progressed, but cotton production declined instead. The difference between supply and demand became larger and larger, and more and more foreign cotton was imported. The following table shows the supply and consumption of cotton production in our country in the last ten years: (Unit: Dan)</p>
<p>Supply Total Spinning Factory Consumption</p>
<p>8,950,152 6,033,000</p>
<p>7,30 ·504 5,891,000</p>
<p>8,815,500 6,037,000</p>
<p>9,400,856 6,581,000</p>
<p>7,212,117 7,200,000</p>
<p>7,526,690 7,56,000</p>
<p>9,319,366 7,338,000</p>
<p>11,440,516 8,939,280</p>
<p>10,262,644 8,859,968</p>
<p>11,155,229 8,965,935</p>
<p>Customs, the net number of imported cotton in the country, excluding exported cotton; spinning factory consumption is the amount used by yarn factories; in addition, cotton used for clothing filling is not included, that is, the difference between supply and consumption. From the above table, it is clear that the quantity of cotton in our country does not meet the demand, and foreign cotton must be used to expand its shortage. The recent surge in imports of foreign cotton is not only limited to the quantity. With social progress, textiles are becoming more refined, the number of yarns is increasing, and raw materials are changing from coarse fleece to fine fleece. The so-called fine fleece that can be used for spinning higher yarn counts in our country is Yangmian produced domestically. According to the survey, the amount of Yangmian was 2,079,543 dan in the 18th year of the Republic of China, 3,169,889 dan in the 19th year, 2,523,650 dan in the 20th year, and 3,065,995 dan in the 21st year, averaging less than 3 million dan per year. Due to the degradation of quality and the blending of coarse cotton by cotton merchants, less than half of these 3 million dan of Yangmian can actually be used for fine yarn spinning, probably no more than 1.5 million dan. Compared with the current number of fine yarns produced in the country, the difference is very large. The following is the ratio of various cottons sold in domestic spinning mills in the last four years:</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton American Cotton Indian Cotton Egyptian Cotton Other</p>
<p>Year 18 68.25 13.66 17.99 0.04 0.0</p>
<p>Year 19 63.11 13.60 22.76 0.21 0.3</p>
<p>Year 20 49.67 26.43 23.2 0.43 0.18</p>
<p>Year 21 52.13 38.58 8.81 0.45 0.03</p>
<p>American cotton and Egyptian cotton are all fine fleece, some of the Chinese cotton is fine fleece, and Indian cotton and other cotton are coarse fleece. In the last four years, the amount of Chinese cotton has decreased, the amount of American cotton has increased sharply, the amount of Indian cotton has decreased greatly in the 21st year, and the increase rate of Egyptian cotton has also increased greatly. This clearly shows the progress in the sale of fine fleece. The fine fleece produced in China is far from enough to meet the demand. This is a special reason for the sharp increase in imports of American cotton in recent years. In the 20th year, the total value of imported foreign cotton was 179,082,246 taels, which jumped to the first place in the customs value of goods. Chinese people have long heard the saying that the customs leakage is the largest for cotton goods. It was unexpected that the rapid progress of cotton would replace the position of cotton goods. This is a huge loss to the national wealth, and its impact on the cotton industry and the decline of rural areas is profound.</p>
<p>The rural economy depends on the export of products to obtain cash to purchase the materials needed. In addition, rural and urban areas are also flowing with gold. In recent years, the quantity of cotton production has been low and has not increased with the spinning. It accounts for half of the textile raw materials taken from abroad, and the cloth woven from this half of foreign cotton is mostly transported to rural areas in the interior. The loss of cotton is completely borne by the rural areas in China. In the 21st year, the value of imported cotton was 180 million taels, which is tantamount to the rural areas having to pay 180 million yuan to make up for the fact that cotton production cannot meet the demand for cloth. The first step of this 180 million taels is from the spinning mill to the outside of the country. The spinning mill weaves the cloth and then transports it to the rural areas to absorb cash to compensate for it. In the ten years from the 12th year to the 21st year, the value of imported cotton was 930 million taels, which is the loss borne by the farmers in terms of clothing due to the fact that they cannot produce the corresponding textile raw materials. In recent years, the business of cotton has not increased, and the number of foreign cotton imported has increased even more. In addition, the two items of rice and wheat are also like this. How can the rural areas not fall into a state of near collapse? At the same time, the textile industry, on the one hand, had to purchase cotton from foreign countries due to the lack of domestic raw materials. The price of foreign cotton is high, and there are taxes on imports, which is enough to make the industry unfavorable. On the other hand, since the rural areas cannot balance the production and consumption of goods, the gold overflows and the financial resources are depleted, and the purchasing power is naturally weak, resulting in a sharp reduction in the demand for yarn and cloth. The stock of yarn in Shanghai has reached as many as 160,000 packages. Therefore, it is said that the decline of the spinning industry and rural areas is directly and indirectly related to the lack of cotton production.</p>
<p>Cotton is the agricultural product second only to rice and wheat in our country, and textiles are the largest industry in the country. Therefore, to rescue the cotton industry, we should pay attention to cotton production, that is, to revitalize the village. Planting cotton is also a key point. If the 4 million dan of cotton imported is produced domestically, the rural areas will increase their income by 180 million yuan, which will benefit the rural economy. It is not a small amount. At the same time, the purchasing power of farmers will increase spontaneously. The 160,000 packages of yarn in Shanghai will also disappear without wings. It is not only possible but also very easy to increase domestic cotton production by 4 million dan. Jiangsu and Hubei provinces have already been called the most famous cotton-producing areas in our country. However, according to the survey, the amount of wasteland in these two provinces that can be reclaimed to plant cotton is even more than the existing cotton field area. The coastal salt reclamation areas in Jiangsu can all plant cotton, and its area is half of the existing cotton field area in the country. The area of Henan and Shaanxi in the northwest is even more countless. My friend Li Guozhen is in charge of planting cotton in Shaanxi and wrote to me that the completion of the Jinghui Canal can increase the cotton area by 3 million mu. However, the domestic cotton production hovers around 8 million dan every year. It is a pity that it is not even close to this. It is not necessary to talk about easy quality and change. There are certainly many reasons for this. Let's divide it into direct and indirect aspects and talk about the most obvious ones.</p>
<p>In the direct aspect, of course, it is the failure to devote efforts to improving cotton planting. The government has no initiative to do it, and the people may have an initiative to do it, but there are various obstacles, so improving cotton planting is just empty talk on paper, and there is very little practical work. The reason why American cotton has today is due to the hard work of the US Department of Agriculture. Looking back at our country, what about it? India has been reduced to a British colony, and there is still a central cotton planting committee. Looking back at our country, what about it? If we can devote a little effort to improving cotton, the benefits are where the people are going. If we guide the situation, the results will be like holding a left coupon. Zhejiang used to produce the roughest and shortest cotton, and only 10 yarns were spun. Now it can also produce cotton that can spin 32 yarns. Hunan used to not produce cotton, but now it produces more than 200,000 dan of cotton, and the quality is also tending to Hubei. Other provinces such as Shandong and Shaanxi have all achieved considerable results, which is also the result of the authorities' slight efforts. Jiangsu has always been the number one cotton-producing area in China, but recently the output and quality have declined. It is not that Jiangsu is suddenly not suitable for planting cotton. It is also because the authorities have ignored it. Now, comparing Jiangsu and Hunan, one advances and the other retreats, what is the relationship between the rural areas and the spinning industry? Therefore, we people can just not raise our voices and sing loudly to rescue the rural areas, so that we can pay a little attention to the rural areas in peacetime, and we will certainly not collapse like this. As for the technical issues of improving cotton planting, there are many reasons. Now I will not discuss them in detail.</p>
<p>Speaking of indirect relations, our country not only fails to devote efforts to improving cotton planting, but there are many things that hinder the development of cotton planting. Let's take the most obvious ones. 1. Cotton areas are mostly in the interior, while spinning mills for selling cotton are in the ports. When cotton is transported from the producing area to the spinning mill, taxes are levied repeatedly, once and again. When cotton is transported from Shaanxi and Henan to the east, the names of the taxes are too numerous to mention. Recently, the business tax has been implemented, and cotton is taxed once every time it changes hands. The burden is almost the same as that of imported foreign cotton. 2. Inconvenient transportation and high freight rates are also reasons that affect the development of cotton production. In a certain year, cotton in Shaanxi was hoarded for three years and could not be transported to the east, and the price was also extremely low. The southeast was in a cotton famine. This situation happens from time to time. Shaanxi is the most suitable for the growth of long-staple cotton, and the domestic demand for long-staple cotton is increasing day by day. Its cotton planting should be developed, but the fact is very different. It is given by many obstacles to transportation. It goes without saying that the freight rate is heavier. From the northwest to Shanghai, the cost is no less than that of American cotton to our country, and there is no guarantee that the route will be blocked. 3. Cotton merchants mix and blend moisture, and the government has issued three orders and five declarations, but has not taken practical measures to ban it. The cotton in Shaanxi and Henan often has lengths of nearly one and a half inches, but it is mixed with cotton that is less than eight points, so that the long fleece also loses its value. Farmers plant long fleece but cannot get the price that long fleece cotton should get, and they cannot put it into practical use, which hinders the improvement of cotton production. Nothing is better than this. There are now inspection bureaus for moisture blending, but manufacturers buy cotton. Penalties are imposed for evil but not rewards for good. For example, if the moisture content of cotton is above 12 catties, the price will be deducted, and if it is below 12 catties, the price will not be increased, so the effect is shallower. For all these reasons, factory owners lament that it is better to use foreign cotton than to use Chinese cotton. The authorities are aiming at tax revenue and freight. I wonder if rural areas will decline and agricultural production will not increase. Taxes and freight will also be reduced to nothing. This policy of draining the pond to catch fish has been in place for a long time, and it is reasonable to create today's situation. Therefore, we must establish a circle and do not have to revitalize and rescue it. We can reasonably and legally rectify the causes of the disease that hinder its progress in the possible scope. The rural areas and the cotton industry will be revived spontaneously.</p>
<p>Special Issue on Cooperative Movement 丨Continued from this Journal on July 1丨</p>
<h3 id="e261">Cooperative Movement and the Transformation of Joint-Stock Companies Wang Zongpei <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Cooperation is a new economic organization that has emerged in the world in the last 100 years, and it has achieved considerable results in various countries. It has also been officially introduced to China for more than ten years. In the past ten years, scholars have advocated it first, and then the government has promoted it. The cooperative movement has also progressed from the period of publicity and advocacy to the period of practice and organization. The organization and establishment of cooperative societies in various provinces and regions have also shown unprecedented progress. According to the statistics of the 21st year of the Republic of China, there were 2,673 cooperative societies in the country, with a total of 987,788 members. This number seems to be very large, but compared with the national population of 480 million, it only accounts for 2/10,000, which is still a very small number. It is even more impossible to compare it with advanced European countries.</p>
<p>The reason why the cooperative movement cannot be universally developed and receive practical benefits cannot be blamed on the comrades who advocate it. I blame the majority of the people for being A Dou, who is an illiterate. They have never heard of or seen this kind of business since they were born, and there is not a shadow of it in their heads. Therefore, no matter how hard the advocates shout, they are still confused. This kind of work that plays the lute to a cow is of course futile. A part of the advocates had no choice but to adopt a strategy of tempting them with profits, telling them that if they organized a cooperative society, the government could lend them money as capital. These sweets have certainly had considerable effect. Many farmers, with 12 points of hope, established cooperative societies, but unfortunately, the sweets are just a kind of verbal benefit, and many cooperative societies have become statistical records because they cannot borrow money.</p>
<p>Failure is the mother of success. The mistakes of the past have given us many lessons. We know that there is also a kind of cooperative organization among the Jewish people, called Axtia (Axia). This kind of Axia spread from Eastern Europe to Western Europe, and then to Asia and North America. In the second half of the 19th century, the cooperative movement in Europe rose, and followed the trend of the times, Axia was also baptized. Now, many of the Axtias in the United States have gone through registration procedures and become legal organizations, protected by the Credit Union Act. The credit cooperation of Axtia is really a point worth studying in the cooperative movement. The current cooperative system has been introduced to our country for more than ten years. The injected publicity in the past few years has still had very little effect. I remember that Mr. Hu Hanmin once said in "How to Promote Cooperative Undertakings": "Cooperation is a very good term, but we must not be shocked by the good term of cooperation and ignore the inherent cooperative undertakings in our country. The inherent cooperative undertakings in our country, although they do not have the name of cooperation, have the reality of cooperation." Mr. Hu said that "the inherent cooperative undertakings in our country that have the reality of cooperation but not the name of cooperation" is the joint-stock system. He believes that if he can earnestly improve him according to the principles of cooperation and make him truly adapt to the requirements of the people, he will definitely become a good organization for the people to regulate finance.</p>
<p>The joint-stock company is an inherent cooperative system in our country, also known as "gathering", commonly known as "Pan Tao", and some people also use the three words "human character head" as a pronoun. These are all names in the Taihu Lake basin of Jiangnan. In the Huaiyang area of Jiangbei, it is called "inviting meetings"; in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, it is called "playing meetings"; in the Jinquyan prefectures of eastern Zhejiang, it is called "gathering meetings", and in the Ningshao area, it is called "jiao meetings". The name in the two Guang provinces is "doing meetings", but Yunnan Province is called "Shehui". Although the words are different, the meaning is the same, and the methods are largely the same. The difference is that the joint-stock companies in various places have some local colors. The size of the joint-stock, the length of the meeting period, the number of members, and the level of interest are somewhat different.</p>
<p>Although the joint-stock company is said to have different methods in different places, the meaning and spirit are consistent. We should also give this praiseworthy inherent cooperative system a cooperative baptism, just like the Axtia, so that he can establish a rising special force for the history of East Asian cooperation. If the cooperative movement can use this kind of folk cooperative foundation, it is tantamount to getting a shortcut to the people, and it will definitely have a great impact on the progress of cooperation.</p>
<p>Speaking of using some joint-stock companies, we must first talk about the current difficulties of cooperative societies. Now the organization of most cooperative societies is nothing more than wanting to borrow some money, so when organizing, they only seek to establish it quickly. The members are naturally randomly gathered, and the society fees are also collected to the minimum extent. Moreover, most of the cooperative societies are of unlimited liability nature due to the amount of money borrowed. After the formalities for establishment and registration are completed, whether they have borrowed money or not, they will probably not plan the progress of the society affairs any more. Therefore, the society shares of cooperative societies that have been established for one or two years are still the previous numbers, and there are no records of savings. What is the use of this kind of cooperative society that only knows how to rely on others and does not seek independence?</p>
<p>To establish a solid foundation for cooperative undertakings, we must first correct the mistakes of the past. If cooperative societies want to break a path of survival from the current gloom, they must vigorously implement the savings policy of members, and the application of the joint-stock system is also a method of promoting savings for members. In this way, not only can savings be realized, but also the relationship between members can be strengthened.</p>
<p>If a cooperative society wants to use the joint-stock system to develop its savings business, it cannot swallow the whole thing. It must transform the joint-stock system in moderation so as not to violate the principles of cooperation. Assuming that we take the bidding meeting as the object of transformation, my personal opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Organizational issues. The head meeting organized by the cooperative society is the cooperative society. It is divided into several groups, and the members of each group are limited to members of the cooperative society, from 15 to 20 people. The first phase is collected by the cooperative society as a fund, without interest, and the head of the bidding can also be sent in the future.</p>
<p>2. Meeting funds. The meeting funds of the bidding meeting depend on the economic strength of the members (i.e., the members), at least two yuan and at most ten yuan. A member must recognize at least half a meeting and at most two or three meetings.</p>
<p>3. Meeting period. The meeting period also depends on local habits, at most once a month, or once every two or three months.</p>
<p>4. Bidding head issues. The interest rate of the bidding meeting is stipulated by the cooperative society with very high and very low restrictions, and the maximum and minimum number of bidding heads in each period is calculated according to compound interest. Make sure that you do not suffer losses when you receive first and then receive later. Members cannot exceed the highest limit when bidding. If two or more people bid the highest price, then the recipient of the meeting will be replaced by the second highest bidder. The head of the bidding in each period is kept by the cooperative society and distributed when the meeting is full.</p>
<p>5. Distribution of meeting funds. When a member wins the meeting funds, he must submit 2/10 of the meeting funds, 1/10 to purchase shares of the cooperative society, and another 1/10 as savings deposits. And you must submit a guarantee of considerable value, and a credit guarantee is also possible, before you can receive the money.</p>
<p>This is a rough design, and I hope that the cooperative society will try it out and the experts will give guidance.</p>

<p>The existing wholesale cooperatives are actively striving to expand wholesale organizations, select central hubs for commerce and transportation, build cooperative sites, construct warehouses, establish factories, and various production organizations. They are also working to unite cooperatives of different types to consolidate the power of the national cooperative movement. The Dutch wholesale cooperative has been established for a long time. Last year, they built a grand wholesale cooperative in Rotterdam. Cooperatives across the country are members of the association. Future development is immeasurable. A country's cooperation can only establish trademarks for goods and proceed to self-production after it has a complete wholesale cooperative. Otherwise, even with sufficient capital, it will be difficult to sustain due to a lack of sales channels. So-called merchant cooperatives are organizations where retail merchants organize and use wholesale methods for joint purchasing. Therefore, the current cooperative movements in various countries, which are dealing with retail merchants, must put all their efforts into promoting wholesale cooperation to make it a complete and sound organization. Thus, this effort by cooperatives is to meet two important internal and external demands.</p>
<p>(4) Implementation of Branch System: The cooperative movement is a product of capitalism, and all measures are changing with each passing day following capitalist enterprise methods. Before the branch system became popular in commerce, cooperatives already had similar organizations. Recently, due to the very developed branch method in commerce, especially in the food sector, cooperatives have paid special attention to the responsible branch system. Large capitalist stores often set up branches in every district of the city and even in various towns across the country from the beginning of their opening. Their goods are either produced by themselves or purchased in bulk. Combined with rationalization in management and transportation, the cost is naturally lower. Moreover, customers can buy what they need anywhere. There is no need to go to places far from home to buy things. After the Swiss consumer cooperative succeeded in the two steps of unification and consolidation, the area where its members are distributed is very wide. If there were no branches, there would be many difficulties. Therefore, this movement has developed rapidly in recent years. When we walked around in Baar, Switzerland, we saw neat and beautiful small shops with red facades everywhere. These are branches of the upper and lower Baar consumer cooperatives. Moreover, there are three or four such branches in one area, separately selling various groceries and other items that can be handled independently. We paid special attention to this trend when investigating the European cooperative movement this time.</p>
<p>(5) Universality of Neutral Tendencies: Cooperation is a free organization that does not ask about political and religious beliefs. Since the Nimes school established the principle of neutrality with consumers as the center, it has been adhered to by cooperatives in various countries. Even cooperatives that are essentially run or controlled by a political party or a religious faction still use neutrality as a slogan on the surface, both to unite internally and to appeal to society. The Belgian cooperative movement is rooted in the Belgian Socialist Party and trade unions. To this day, it still cooperates with political parties and trade unions, which can be said to be a trinity. The Belgian Cooperative Bureau, the central organization of Belgian cooperation, had its leaders tell us last winter about the relationship between political parties and cooperatives, and there were talks about making the two independent. Because past facts tell us that the development of cooperation is often affected by political parties. This influence is only economic. As for the past in Italy, it was simply fundamentally destroyed by politics. This time, when Hitler came to power, although there has been no news about cooperatives, judging from what we heard in Germany, we deeply know that the cooperatives under the Hamburg Consumer Cooperative Union will also share the same fate as the cooperatives in Italy at that time. In short, this principle of neutrality has not seen significant application in practice, but cooperators in various countries are proclaiming it there every day.</p>
<p>This brief introduction cannot be said to have clarified the trends of the European cooperative movement. Readers who are particularly interested in this are hoped to read our "Investigation Report on the European Cooperative Movement," which we are currently drafting, in the future.</p>
<p>Corrigendum: In the Shanghai Cooperative's article, "company asset" should be corrected to "member"</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from forty or fifty firms was still sluggish, and the purchases were all selected fresh and special goods. Medium-grade goods were exceptionally quiet, and old goods were rarely inquired about, so the market situation was such that high-grade goods could still stand firm, but the prices of other medium-grade and old goods were all revised downwards. Although the 北洋 (Beiyang), 烟台 (Yantai), and other gangs continued to move (but the number was only a thousand packages), and looking at the 客家 (Kejia) attitude, it seemed to be sluggish, so although high-grade goods could stand firm, medium-grade goods had not been opened, and looking at the overall situation, it seemed to be directly turning downstream. Moreover, people's hearts were floating, and there was little hope of recovery. Du Yang’s pointed rice was priced high due to the lack of goods, and the price of fragrant rice was stable, and 元 (yuan) was平平 (mediocre).</p>

<h3 id="e268">A Picture of Life: The Small Vegetable Market <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>-- Yao</p>
<p>I have had the determination to visit the small vegetable market for a long time; there is no gathering place for selling vegetables, fish, and meat in the townships, so it is no wonder that people in the countryside are curious about the small vegetable market in big cities. Finally, on a Sunday morning, I stepped into the small vegetable market!</p>
<p>There are various stalls here, some selling fresh fish, some selling fresh meat, fresh shrimp, etc. There are various different loads, some with beans, some with vegetables, some with melons. Judging from the facial expressions of the various vendors, I know that they are all expecting to have more customers than usual today -- just like farmers expect a bountiful autumn harvest. Some are shouting with all their might how cheap and how good their goods are to attract customers. Some are sprinkling water on their goods, and some are putting ice on them, in order to sell well -- or because of a difference of one or two copper coins, the transaction cannot be completed. Conflicts over prices lead to quarrels and even turn into a full-scale brawl. On the buying side, there are merchants' wives who can barely make a living, haggling over prices and weighing goods everywhere, trying to get some cheap goods. There are cooks and maids from mansions, discussing with them what to buy today to please their masters and get some kickbacks for themselves. Each one is holding on to their money tightly, unwilling to easily complete a transaction. There are also a few young mistresses and wives who, because they played mahjong for a few rounds the night before, still have their eyelids tightly closed, barely able to bear their fatigue. If you can see how many goods are in her basket when she leaves, you can determine whether her mahjong game last night was a victory or a defeat. There are laborers who have scraped together the number of copper coins they brought to exchange for the leftovers that others have chosen. There are small vendors from Jiangbei, looking like refugees,争奪 (contending) for the yellow leaves peeled off by others and the fresh goods that are rotten and unbearable.</p>
<p>Here, you can clearly see:</p>
<p>The people in the city are also struggling for life in the same way.</p>
<p>The people in the city are also stingy with money in the same way!</p>
<h3 id="e269">Puppets Can Also Start Talking <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>-- Xueying</p>
<p>Puppets, also known as wooden figures, were not originally all made of wood. They could be made of thin leather or hard paper, cut into shapes, etc., placed on top of circles with axle holes left in the center, like wheels. A candle was lit in the middle, and a higher circle coated with white paper was placed on top. Manpower was used to push it, causing it to move forward in a circle, called a leather puppet or a running horse lantern. Although not very common, at least a considerable number of people have seen them.</p>
<p>Another more popular type is the puppet show that people from Jiangbei perform in Shanghai. They do have wood components, and because they are more popular, I won't describe their construction in detail. In the past, you could sometimes see them in the City God Temple or empty wastelands. Now, I'm afraid there are even more! After the January 28th Incident in Zhabei, there were more empty wastelands, so the opportunities to see them are even greater. This also deserves a word of praise for the cleverness of the people of Jiangbei! Inside a roughly five-foot square stage, they hide musical instruments such as gongs and drums. The person controlling the puppet behind it has to make the puppet move, speak, and the gongs and drums sound. This is all supported by just one person, so he can be considered clever. However, the words below, the audience may find even rarer! Because the puppet itself can tell lies.</p>
<p>Before talking about the construction of the puppet that can speak, I have to introduce it again, because its construction is not at all like the two types mentioned above. Although the faces are different, they are like our Southern products, which can be said to be a rare thing. No, people who don't grow up in the South may not have seen it! But now, if you need to see it, there are also places to see it. That is, in the lace shops around the 大白渡桥 (Great White Bridge), they call it Mandarin-doll. I heard that foreigners are now buying them to put at home as Joss to worship, learning our noble Chinese customs. But they only use fresh flowers, 清香 (incense), and 白臘 (white wax). Now I have to add that those sold are only the embryos used for puppet shows in the South. They have not yet been fitted with the handle that controls their movements. There are a total of three handles for controlling the movements, made of iron or bamboo. One is installed on the back of the body to support her so that she can stand freely. The other two are installed on her left and right hands respectively. These are a bit more troublesome than the Jiangbei people's, because each person can only operate one. Speaking, of course, also has to be done by someone else. It's simply all controlled by the person behind, a bit like the double act in the 大世界 (Great World), but the puppet show is very small.</p>
<p>Recent puppet shows are becoming more and more advanced. Those old-fashioned ones are probably not as good! They are indeed much more advanced. Now, the three handles behind the puppet are also trained to speak. There is no need for the person behind to control them, and they can also propose and preside. However, in this modern age of 科舉 (imperial examination) prosperity, this is not a strange thing. What we should be surprised at is that the puppet itself speaks and argues with the handles about who is right and wrong. The audience must want to hear what she said, right? Let me write it below: "You are doing things that will drive us to extinction, calling me to take the blame. What's the point of this? Be more content and leave some room for your descendants... You are relying on the Guandong Army to be in charge. Why are you looking for me? I quit." See the 北平 (Beiping) correspondence in the Shen Bao of the 27th (赵欣伯 (Zhao Xinbo), 熙洽 (Xi Qia), and 郑孝胥 (Zheng Xiaoxu) are investigating and sealing up the properties of former dignitaries in the three northeastern provinces in the puppet state of Manchukuo, and encouraging the heads of the Guandong Army to handle everything...). The fact is so strange. Although modern science is prosperous and puppets have been invented to be like living people, if the three handles do not cooperate with the puppet, they will probably still become waste. You who control it from behind, although you can make good use of waste, you are still not clever enough, unlike our Jiangbei people!</p>

<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>We see that the current social environment is changing day by day, constantly turning towards that dark and lightless road; it has led to the people of today also following its transformation. People's hearts are getting worse day by day; especially our young men and women, their moral character has also deteriorated. Tempted by the social trends, it has led many promising young people to turn into base people; alas! Society has reached such a state, it is really terrible! Because of this, I want to organize a "Youth Moral Vigilante Corps" to warn these young people to go towards the bright road. Do you think this organization is good? Does it have any relationship with the law? Please teach me well! With sincere wishes for a pleasant summer. Respectfully, Tian Yuqing.</p>
<p>Editor's reply: The fact that the morals of young people are deteriorating day by day is indeed a great danger to the future of the nation. I admire Tian Jun's vision in wanting to find a way to correct this. However, the method proposed by Tian Jun is really not permitted by law. The improper behavior of young people in general now has not yet reached the point of violating the law, or even if they have violated the law, what they have committed is a private accusation crime. Unless they are directly harmed, other people have no right to consult. Therefore, it is illegal for you to organize a vigilante corps to interfere with them. If you don't do it well, you will be violating regulations such as "infringement of freedom" and "infringement of privacy." We believe that since the purpose of this society is legitimate, it can be slightly changed so that it will not be prohibited by law. First, the name of this corps should be changed to something like Youth Encouragement Corps. Second, the scope of vigilance should be limited to members who have filled out a volunteer form. Third, if you think that its effectiveness is too small in this way, then you can use the method of propaganda to expand the number of members.</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>The night was quiet and still. Alone in my small room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of being lost. Because Wang Hua borrowed money, I remembered that I only had four meal tickets in my pocket, and I couldn't help but take a cold breath. "Alas... you need power, you need a crowd, then they'll be willing to give you money for books! Okay, let's do it his way." But where is our power and our crowd? His heart hung up again. Indeed, Shi Qiao had always been a lover of literature and music, especially in the past two years, busy chasing after life, and he had long been alienated from mass activities. Moreover, his arrogance made him fundamentally despise Wang Hua's so-called masses. What could he do now? Of course, the more he thought about it, the less he could come up with a result, so he gave up on himself and lay down on the bed.</p>
<p>In the silence, the faint, mournful sound of the pipa from Meizi's room came, which stirred up his sad mood even more. His long-forgotten old mother gradually stirred his imagination, and then his gentle childhood came to him as well. He couldn't help but feel a pang in his nose, and tears almost flowed out.</p>
<p>"Is this still like a young man?" He suddenly sat up, clenched his fists, and examined his tall body, from which he deduced his future and destiny.</p>
<p>The sound of cannons in Zhabei had been echoing day and night for many days. He went to open the window, gazing remotely at the black sky on the front line, and his blood boiled again. But the stars in the sky were still winking peacefully. He then wondered if Zhou Shaoping had reached the front line and how Zhang Honglie was doing. A gust of chilly night wind slapped his face, and he instinctively closed the window. The pipa sound of the sorrowful foreigner was still chirping a sad tune, and he suddenly felt disgusted by this weak sound – a kind of disgust that strong people have for the weak. Unexpectedly, a more violent disgust surged into his chest: the Third Aunt had returned from a drunken dance. The sound of her heels going upstairs. "These drunken dreamers! Drunken dreamers!" He resolved not to associate with this enchanting woman anymore.</p>
<p>That night, no matter how his thoughts and feelings changed, they ultimately converged on "How should I talk to Chen Tianren tomorrow? Ah, I have to get up early tomorrow!" And so he forced himself to sleep.</p>

<h3 id="e272">New Trends in the Japanese Film Industry (Part 1) <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Peculiarities of Film Censorship and the Kissing Problem</p>
<p>Using Film as a Tool for International Propaganda</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers and magazines have recently been attacking the film censorship board, saying that their censorship of films is very strict; in fact, this is not the case. In the eyes of some people, Japanese film censorship has always been very lenient in its examination of films. In Japan, when all films are reviewed, an average of three out of twenty-five frames are cut by the censorship board. But in the United States, three out of five reviewed films are cut. On this point alone, can we really criticize the Japanese film censorship board? In Japan, the film censorship board reviews roughly twenty films a day, but here we must remember a common condition, which is that the main issue they review is whether the content of the film is sufficient to affect the morals of the Japanese people. In the film, a particular segment often meets the scissors, and that is the kissing scene. In other countries, the kissing scene in a film may not always be cut. But in Japan, as long as it is a kiss, regardless of whether it harms public morals, it must be completely cut. This is because kissing is completely contrary to Japanese customs and is purely a Western etiquette. Japanese audiences will laugh wildly when they see kissing on the screen because they don't know what kissing is all about. And what the Japanese film censorship board wants to cut from foreign films is this kind of sensual kissing. As for kissing as an expression of true love, such as a husband and wife, mother-in-law and children, lovers expressing true love, the censorship board preserves and does not cut. Since the invention of sound films, a new problem has arisen. On the screen, a sound can be made when kissing, and the censorship board also cuts out kisses with sound because Japanese movie fans do not welcome this kind of kissing sound. Japanese directors sometimes adopt new methods, using women's arms around men's shoulders, or heels off the floor, both of which are ways of implying a kiss, but the censorship board also cuts these places.</p>
<p>However, in any case, in Japan, due to the influence of foreign films, the matter of kissing will sooner or later be allowed by the authorities. Regardless of the preferences of the censorship board or private individuals, there will eventually be a day of reality. Because Japanese people have gradually understood the true meaning of kissing recently, so in the near future, within reasonable limits, kissing will definitely be seen on the screen. But it's still impossible now! In addition, what the censorship board pays attention to is whether a film has any harm to Japan's political and social system. For this reason, Soviet films cannot be publicly screened in Japan. However, some people say that Soviet films do not suit the tastes of the Japanese, so the Japanese do not welcome them, and they are not suitable for the Japanese imagination. According to the Japanese censorship board, American films have been catering to the lower classes more and more recently, so censorship work has become increasingly difficult. (To be continued)</p>

<p>According to a Trans-Pacific News Agency dispatch from Berlin, the world's first inventor of motion pictures was a German named Max Skladanowsky. He is now seventy years old, forty years after his invention, but his great name has been buried and very few people know about it. Gao Boer, the current Minister of Propaganda of Germany, knows his secrets very well; he made a special trip to visit Mr. Skladanowsky at his former residence. Seeing Mr. Skladanowsky in his old age, Mr. Gao couldn't help but feel sad. After returning, he immediately announced the news, praising his deeds, and organized a special committee to plan for Mr. Skladanowsky's future, and started a fundraising campaign. The government also intends to posthumously award a bonus to reward his功. According to reports, Mr. Skladanowsky invented the motion picture as early as 1895. On November 1 of that year, Mr. Skladanowsky registered his new invention with the government in Berlin, and on the same day, he publicly screened his motion picture in Berlin. For a time, those who saw the shadows of people on the screen coming and going were all regarded as strange and kept marveling. Unfortunately, he was trapped by his financial resources and could not continue to research. Later, those who rose up had heard the news and followed, causing Mr. Skladanowsky to be buried for decades, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e274">Review of "Hot-Handed Punishment of Adultery" *This Sporting Age* <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Almost every American movie is the same, no matter what the story is, there must be love. Generally speaking, this film should be crowned with the title of "martial arts film," but the "fighting martial arts" scenes do not occupy a major part. On the contrary, the depiction of love is carefully shot, and the horse racing and polo scenes are just some lively insertions. Therefore, if the author of this film originally intended to focus on martial arts, it is inevitable that the secondary becomes the primary.</p>
<p>But since they relaxed the main theme of martial arts and focused on the depiction of love, then how is the latter depicted? I feel that as shown on the screen, there is no central depiction at all. If the protagonist, Steel, is a model character in the author's mind, such as his fairness and lack of harshness towards subordinates, then he should cherish himself for that widow. Can he kill Mallaire who has raped his daughter and not blame himself? Of course, he cannot be regarded as a "perfect person," not to mention the so-called "killing with a hidden arrow is not a hero." Then should his daughter be a model character? Yes, the author does have a consistent description of her, but is her chastity something that every audience can sympathize with? As for the love scene between the daughter and that young man, it is even more unnecessary in the play.</p>
<p>The above is a judgment based on the structure of the story. As for the meaning, it is completely empty.</p>
<p>However, the directing skills of this film are quite worth seeing in small aspects. Although the director is primarily responsible for the proper handling of the plot, especially for the contradictions in the protagonist's personality as mentioned above, he has had a great deal of success in Montage. For example, from the time the girl and the lustful man met in the dance hall to the time she was raped, the process in between is written very carefully and fully. Also, the girl's phone call to the widow's house, lightly explaining the fornication between her father and the widow, is also a very flexible trick. Furthermore, the kiss that the groom sees under the horse's feet, and the girl's initial trick to get her father away from that widow, all show intelligence. However, apart from this, the director's handling of the girl's killing scene is still not good enough. It should be the most tense scene. But it passed lightly. However, this is where he tries his best to help the actors, because it is originally difficult to perform, so he cleverly glosses over it. The last few shots of the grand reunion are unnecessary. The scenes of the girl lying ill after taking poison are all inappropriate.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the protagonist, Jack Holt, is very spirited. He is the most successful in the play. Although most of the actresses who play girls are still passable, they cannot have difficult performances. The character of the lustful man is very considerate in flirting. The groom also maintained his past achievements. As for the girl's lover, he is the weakest.</p>
<p>Overall, this is definitely not a successful work.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Review of "Battlefield Hell" *No Man's Land* <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Feng</p>
<p>A non-war film worth noting</p>
<p>At a time when the clouds over Asia are gathering, we cannot but attach importance to the great significance of this "Battlefield Hell" *No Man's Land* appearing on the screen. We know that films like "The Sky is the Limit" are of educational significance to the military-national people. Then, our non-war and the inspiration for peace that we give people in this "Battlefield Hell" is undoubtedly worthy of our experience and deep meaning of this non-war significance.</p>
<p>This "Battlefield Hell" writes about five people with different occupations, but the same is that they are living a safe and sweet life, and are swept into the hell of the battlefield by the hurricane of the First World War. Originally, these five people of different nationalities on the battlefield should be facing each other with swords and guns, but once they arrived in this hell, when everyone was struggling above the line of death, that kind of common pain and sorrow extinguished their hatred, and strongly caused them to move forward towards the road to peace with one heart and one mind under the meaning of surviving together.</p>
<p>The director has a "non-war determination," so every scene contains the meaning of "non-war." Although the first half of the film, which depicts the lives of those five people with different occupations, is a bit slack, the use of that kind of contrasting writing is commendable. Especially in the last scene, the five people come out of the broken trenches hand in hand, and work together to remove the barbed wire that hinders them from entering the realm of peace, thus blowing up the hell of the battlefield! This cannot but be said to be the director's cleverness.</p>
<p>Speaking of performance, the five people of different nationalities who are struggling on the line of death are all very good, especially the black man. Although the others do not have many performance opportunities, the "non-war" spirit is a common expression of everyone, revealed.</p>
<p>Therefore, we feel that although this "Battlefield Hell" cannot be regarded as a perfect film, the "non-war" significance in the present time when people are panicking about the advent of war is worth noting!</p>
<h3 id="e276">Review of "Dry Wood and Raging Fire" (*Hello Sister*) <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qun</p>
<p>Two girls longing for love, met two men hunting for beauty, met and loved, loved and met, met and quarreled, so slander, sabotage, set up meetings, turned against each other, and then came a God's favor, the house was also blown up, the woman was in crisis, the man bravely rescued, reunion. That's Dry Wood and Raging Fire!</p>
<p>In terms of plot and screen, "Dry Wood" and "Raging Fire" are indeed ambiguous and conform to reality. But what is the meaning? Where is the meaning? I'm ashamed to say, I don't know!</p>
<p>Does it expose the inequality of marriage problems under the capitalist system? Not enough! Does it describe the conflict between love and friendship? Too sloppy!</p>
<p>If it weren't for the American film that looked better on the screen, I really wouldn't forgive it at all!</p>
<p>Because: First, the story is too ordinary, second, the idea is not clear, like a conflict between love and friendship, but neither love nor friendship is established. Since Mank is so bad and Jim is so good, the two can never become close friends. If they are close friends, at least Mank, who ruins Jim's relationship with Panchi, should be someone who truly loves Panchi, but in fact, Mank is a rascal. And if Jim really loves Panchi, then he is too shallow to be angry and abandoned after hearing a few words of slander from Mank and Meili!</p>
<p>In short, this ordinary story is really so ordinary that it is worthless, making people feel that they cannot raise any kind of emotion after watching it, nor can they get a slightly deeper impression. Although the director desperately used raging fire. Fortunately, the director is still clever, the scenes are clear, the shots are flexible, the insertions are appropriate, and the front and back of the Montage can still make this ordinary story produce some not so ordinary pictures, and the performances of James Dunn and Zasu Pittes are also very natural. The dialogue is also interesting and clear, adding a lot of color to this film.</p>

<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>As for Lily, Walter's kiss only aroused the impulse of the bitter ex-wife—Walter's first kiss—the enthusiasm of his arms—the change of heart in the middle of the hot love—she wondered where Walter had gone. But she is now married to Count Matzbach-Shiber! This is really incredible!</p>
<p>The Count received a letter from Walter, telling him that the statue he had carved for him had been completed and inviting him to attend the unveiling ceremony. The Count tore the letter to pieces. He had no heart to see the person he had bullied again. Walter felt uneasy when he saw that the Count had not arrived. He wanted to see Lily and pour out the melancholy in his heart. After losing Lily, he had no energy at work. He wondered all the time whether Lily would understand him when she saw his suicide note. He now deeply regretted that he did not have the courage at that time and easily allowed the Count to plunder his lover. He now decided to see her again.</p>
<p>Walter then ran to the Count's mansion. When he arrived, the Count happened to be away from home, so he led the way to see Lily. When they met, they endured it and only spoke politely. Finally, Lily vaguely uttered a few complaints, and Walter couldn't bear it anymore.</p>
<p>He said many words of love that he couldn't bear to part with her, walked closer to her, took her hand, and shouted, "Lily, I love you and you love me! You escape with me!"</p>
<p>His enthusiastic and firm sincerity touched her, so that she could no longer bear it. She had long belonged to him. The heart will never change! She asked him to wait a while. He wanted her to escape that night.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt that Count Matzbach was coming, so he stood up. The Count walked into the room and said "Hello" as if nothing had happened. She suppressed the hateful suspicion in her heart, deliberately welcomed Walter, and invited him to have dinner. He took the opportunity to solve this matter thoroughly. Lily and Walter were like sitting on pins and needles during dinner, and the Count joked. He said that his happiness was given by Walter, and then laughed dryly. Lily cried. She complained that Walter should not have traded her to the Count. Walter wanted to take the opportunity to tell the truth. But Lily was so angry and hateful that she didn't want to listen to him clear his name. She stood up unsteadily and pretended to have a headache, and ran to her room. (To be continued)</p>
