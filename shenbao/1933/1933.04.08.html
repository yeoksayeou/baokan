<h3 id="c18">農村破産中之安内問題乃 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>自九一八事變以還。一般人之主張曰。抗日與剿赤並重。又曰攘外必先安内。因循以至今日。幾一年有半。然以言對外。則三省淪亡之後。繼以熱河。宼氛所及。冀察復告緊張。以言對内。則駐贛大軍。屢折主將。迭喪名城。甚至新淦失陷。南昌告警。事急矣。抗日與剿赤能並重乎。攘外能先安内乎。至今日而不能不有公開之討論。而不能不有平心靜氣之討論。</p>
<p>今日之中國問題。不過爲世界問題之一角。當前中國之内憂外患。爲世界資本主義進展必然之結果。吾人已一再言之。研究中國而昧然於世界之大勢。高談政治而不知經濟爲何物。則虚玄妄想。坐井觀天。安有是處。倉廪實而後知禮節。衣食足而後知榮辱。民不聊生。必挺而走險。先哲所見。實具至理。贛共之行動何若。主義何若。爲别一問題。而其産生。恐不能不認爲經濟環境之使然。不能不認爲農村破産中必然之産物。吾國自民元以至民二一。二十一年間貿易入超。達六十九萬萬元之鉅。二十餘年間軍閥之混戰。約計損失。達一百萬萬元。前年長江水災。損失亦達二十萬萬元。以此三項之損失。分攤於四萬萬之人口。則每人負担已達四十七元零。以貧窮之中國人民。而令負担四十七元有奇之損害。則其破産。復何容疑。</p>
<p>凡此三者。除貿易入超爲帝國主義對華之直接剥削外。軍閥之混戰。亦均以帝國主義爲其背景。水災損失之奇重。半亦由於貧窮混戰之結果。隄防失修所致。故此三者。實代表帝國主義直接間接之剥削。其貿易入超一項。雖年以華僑匯欵及外人在華投資爲挹注。然貿易之剥削。普及於全民衆。而華僑匯欵之受。惠則僅及於少數之人。外人之在華投資。復造成帝國主義更進一層之剥削。此重重之剥削。旣。置整個農村於破産之域泛濫全世界之恐慌復促日本帝國主義對華之加緊侵略。内有革命客觀條件之完成。外有發動民族革命之導火線。於是而猶從容以言安内。其可得乎。</p>
<p>今之所謂安内者。又持何術乎。剿而已耳。剿之結果。在軍事區域。不能不因兵火而使社會財産。增加破壞。在軍事區域以外。則築路設防。勢不能不取諸人民。保甲團防。與大軍經過給養。亦難免不取諸人民。因是之故。民力日耗。即使富農。亦往往因田租所入。不足以償捐稅。而至於逃亡。在此狀况之下。如欲持此以安内。似爲一重大之矛盾。至其所利用以進行剿之工作者。即爲此農民化身之士卒。欲其效命疆塲。亦非易事。</p>
<p>以故在此農村破産之際。吾人認爲安内之工作。决非對内軍事之所能爲　　功。夫政治上之成功。爲利用環境與適應大勢。目下農村之破産。旣爲長時期剥削後革命客觀條件之完成。則舍破釜沉舟。領導人民向日本帝國主義作民族革命之殊死戰外。實無其他途徑。作戰貴有目標。犧牲須有意義。倘能移剿共之師以抗日。則其意義遠矣。</p>

<p>法相辭職旋又打銷</p>
<p>齋藤内閣捉襟見肘</p>
<p>路透七日東京電　法相小山巳於今晨辭職、其所舉之原因、爲渠對司法省中某要員近今參與共産黨陰謀案、應負責云、衆意小山之辭職、或將促起各報近所預料之閣潮、内閣秘書長柴田近之辭職、亦爲被發覺曾參與同一陰謀案之故、各報今對於齋藤内閣、仍予抨擊、指爲有種種輕舉妄動之過失云、　　路透七日東京電　爲今悉小山法相之辭職、猶在數日之前、因政局擾攘之故、嚴守秘密、今日聞日皇已親命小山收回辭職文、謂渠對屬員參與共産陰謀、可不負責云、</p>
<p>電通七日東京電　小山法相之辭職問題、結果决定留任、撤回法相之辭呈、表面上似告一段落、内閣因此得免崩潰、惟小山法相之辭呈、係於五日提交齋藤首相、故首相於六日進宫之際、於侍從武官長之親補禮後、即面奏法相之辭呈、其時并請時值國家非常之秋、應鼓勵法相、爲國效勞、其結果乃退回小山法相之辭呈、因此七日上午九時半、齋藤首相於首相官邸、邀請小山法相傳達日皇意、兼求留任、小山法相因大感動、乃撤回辭呈、九時五十分進宫、表示繼續留任、如是則小山法相乃確定留任也、然齋藤首相於捧呈法相之辭呈之際、曾奏請國家非常時之秋、若以司法部内之職任、無辭職必要、致引起政界方面之感動、勢將成爲重大問題、緣從來捧呈閣員辭呈之際、無首相奏聞自身意見之先例、且不問閣員之意見、獨斷策畫法相之留任、於憲法上亦有重大之疑義、致非難首相此種措置之空氣、現已相當濃厚、故問題將由法相之辭職問題、一變而爲首相之責任問題、而其進行若何、頗堪重視者也、</p>
<p>電通七日東京電　閣員中對於因小山法相辭呈問題而起之奏請辭呈之手續、以及首相之奏聞、意見各異、或謂小山法相於奏請免職之際、應於閣議諮詢、故對首相之措置頗抱不滿、除高橋藏相之進退問題、及其他外、閣内之統制殆甚紊亂、今後對於時局、將滅少魄力、故較此次之奏請問題、更爲重大者之聲浪甚高、如是則以齋藤首相爲主之現内閣、反將總辭職之時期提早云、</p>
<p>日聯七日東京電　小山法相拜受日皇優詔打消辭意、閣内對此有種種意見、本日閣議亦辭討論、總理大臣關於一閣員之辭職問題、上奏意見書者未有其例、政界各方頗重視此問題、聞各派之意見大體如下、政友會、本問題可考慮爲憲法上之重要問題、首相不問手段、頗難諒解、現内閣因此事件成爲風前燈火、倒閣之日不在遠矣、民政黨首相鑒於時局重大、决意排除萬難、實行政務、可以小山法相留任問題證之、首相上奏意見、或成爲問題、然其與内閣命運並無關係、國民同盟、法相辭職之根據、由國民道德上應由首相負責、然首相作成所謂意見書、奉乞日皇留任法相、實難諒解其意、現内閣除於最近時期内實行總辭職外、無法解决此事、貴族院、首相因西園寺元老之意見、希望現内閣担任政務、處理非常時局、故力防閣内之搖動、今後政友會之態度支配政局、現内閣似不能維持現狀、</p>

<p>麥唐納正式接受羅斯福邀請</p>
<p>法意德亦將派代表參加會議</p>
<p>世界經濟戰債軍縮統盤討論</p>
<p>國民六日華盛頓電　美總統今日已發正式請柬、邀請英首相麥唐納來美一行、倘法總理達拉第能有可以抽暇來美之表示、即亦將立即發出同樣請柬、現信法總理達拉第倘因事不克親自來美、或將派外長彭古或前總理赫禮歐爲代表、</p>
<p>路透七日華盛頓電　此間接巴黎消息、法政府將派代表赴美參加羅斯福總統與英相麥唐間問戰債與經濟問題之談話、</p>
<p>路透六日華盛頓電　聞羅斯福總统除邀請英相麥唐納來美商榷外、並願招待其他各國政府之代表、以便討論恢復世界貿易之方法、官塲現預料法意德派員來美之可能性、並有邀請加拿大首相邊納特游美之說、美總統擬與各國代表分别接洽、而不欲舉行圓桌會議、</p>
<p>國民六日華盛頓電　今日自發表邀請麥唐納之請柬送達英大使林德賽後、續悉國務卿赫爾曾非正式通知法國、告以美政府歡迎達拉第或派一代表惠臨、商榷軍縮與經濟問題、據聞此非正式提議内、未曾提及戰債、但此間預料、倘法國與英美執政面談之後、法國戰僨問題當可解决、</p>
<p>又聞美總統與國務卿擬與英法代表討論之範圍極廣、但最注重者爲經濟問題、蓋欲斬除荆棘、開啓坦途、俾世界經濟會議可以順利進行也、</p>
<p>如英法總揆俱能接受邀請、則料麥唐納與法代表將於下星期内啓程來美、而於耶穌復活節假内、從事會商云、</p>
<p>國民六日華盛頓電　今日美國之送出邀請書、與英相麥唐納之正式接受、不過相距數小時、俱由英大使林德賽承轉、聞麥唐納往返俱將乘裴倫迦利亞輪船、在美之日、即將居爲白宫上賓、至麥唐納復柬、有辱承惠邀、至爲感動語、並謂渠之同僚、均勸其接受邀請、</p>
<p>今夜官塲承認麥唐納與美執政所談問題、將毫無限制、據聞羅斯福與赫爾及林德賽、業已擬定一試行程序、無論何時、得提出任何重要問題、惟所談將集中於世界經濟·戰債·及軍縮三事、而其結果、料可淸除召集經濟會議之障礙、</p>
<p>現有報界名主筆數人提議、美總統與英首相會談結束後、宜聯名發一致美國人民書、告以經過情形、猶憶麥唐納上次訪美時、就無線電話中演說、深得美國民衆之同情、而今日能以英國與歐洲所被迫應付之局勢、向美人說明者、逆料當無有更能勝於麥氏者也、</p>
<p>至法總理達拉第之能否親來、抑將派他人爲代表、料在今夜當能有非正式表示云、</p>
<p>路透六日倫敦電　現悉英首相將於四月十五日赴美、約在美京盤桓三四日、又聞世界經濟會議組織委員會將於四月二十二日在倫敦開會、屆時將决定世界經濟會議開會之日期、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日巴黎電　截至日前爲止、法國政府尚未接到美國政府正式邀請、請於最近期内遣派代表前赴華盛頓參加談話、以便商議世界經濟會議籌備事宜、法國政府一俟接獲正式請柬後、即將决定代表人選、達拉第總理大槪不能親自赴華盛頓、外長彭古則因日内瓦工作、須留在歐洲、亦不能赴美、因此或將在閣員以外另選人物最有望者、當爲衆議院外交委員會主席即前内閣總理赫禮歐、或參議院外交委員會主席裴郎依、</p>
<p>路透六日華盛頓電　美國一面邀請英首相麥唐納於耶蘇復活節期中來游美京、一面趕速進行其國際及經濟之政策、現聞授權羅斯福總統在規定範圍内締結互惠的稅則條约、並准羅斯福總統自由與其他國政府辦理世界經濟會議事宜之提案、大致已擬成、</p>
<p>路透七日華盛頓電　今由國會方面傳說、羅斯福總統所擬對外相互商約之計畫、將以進口稅則減少什一爲基礎建設、　　哈瓦斯六日紐約電　據紐约泰晤士報轉載機密消息、羅斯福總統、决不向議會要求取銷戰債之權力、但請議會准其宣佈短期緩付戰債辦法、並准其與外國進行談判、俾以減少戰債、與某種利益相交换云、</p>
<h3 id="c65">法德仇妒將使四强公約成泡影 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>法總理在衆院宣布外交政策</p>
<p>彭古外長草成節略今日送出</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日巴黎電　對於英意兩國所提四强公約之計劃、頃由外長彭古、及外部主管司草成節略、其文甚短、先就原則加以說明、繼以各項具體建議、統以國聯會盟約、關於行政完整及政治獨立之第十條、關於制裁侵略之第十六條、及關於修改條約程序之第十九條爲根據、此一節略除政治條欵而外、對於四强在經濟上合作之利益、予以闡明、换言之、即重申法國所主張之歐洲聯合理論節略、全文大約將於明日分致倫敦羅馬兩處、</p>
<p>路透六日柏林電　今日據半官公報宣稱、意相墨索里尼提出之四强協定、經法國加以修正後、巳失原來面目、故不再能由德國接受云、</p>
<p>路透六日巴黎電　法總理達拉第今日在衆議院發表久爲人所盼望之外交言論、詞中表示法國對於德國時局之惶慮、並發一問句曰、﹁鑒於一種復活的國家主義、歐洲究應重改地圖、以求和平乎﹂、達拉第續稱、法國擬進行建設政策、並反對大國監督權、以其較諸神聖盟約尤爲野心也、任何公約必須在邏輯上以非戰公約洛迦諾公約與整個的國聯盟約爲依歸、而不可根據盟約之一部份、庶此修正不致導成各國之仇妒、法國對於英國軍縮計畫、將提出切實修正文、但法國甚願英國之忠實努力、完全成功云、達民言論中對於英意兩國頗多譽詞、繼言及經濟範圍、謂意相墨索里尼對法所表示之好意、渠願欣然承認之云、言畢、衆議院以四三零票對一零七票通過信任政府案、</p>
<p>路透六日巴黎電　法外長彭古今日在衆院投信任票前演說、謂德國以政治機關與警務機關合併爲一、實屬明日違反和約、法國現方會同洛迦諾公約簽字國各德國提出詰問、如有必要、將在日内瓦提議此事、繼謂軍縮會議現遭遇意德集團之反對、該集團如進行不已、則將引起歐洲明日之戰爭、彭古並稱讚英國之忠誠、末謂意國之建議、自當加以考慮、俾四强國可於在有關係之諸問題相合作云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日華沙電　﹁波蘭郵報﹂訪員訪問捷克外長彭納斯、請其發表關於四强公約之意見、彭納斯宣稱、﹁四國俱樂部成立以後、若繼之以多數之俱樂部、如一般人所預算、則世界將陷入於完全混亂狀態之中、四强若可締結公约、則波蘭及小協商各國、相互訂結公約、有何不可、各大國若欲干涉吾人之事務、吾人何嘗不可干步涉各大國之事務、且俄國亦可與中國聯合以造成兩國俱樂部、而集其目光於英屬印度矣、四國公約之用意、謂係期望和平、但其結果則背道而馳、四强公約一旦告成、凡與吾人有關之事件、若由四强討論之、則吾人當答以何不往日内瓦去、吾人敢信小協商各國與波蘭若果宣言四强公約締結之後、即將退出國聯會、則四强公約、必不致成立、總之四强公約若果成立、則國際聯合會將毁爲瓦礫塲矣、﹂云云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日倫敦電　羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥在此間活動甚力、今晨訪波蘭大使及希臘公使、午間將與前財相張伯倫午餐、午餐後赴外部、并往財部會晤勞斯爵士、晚間將與小協商各國駐倫敦公使晚餐、并於明晨離開倫敦、</p>

<p>撥四千六百萬元造艦</p>
<p>海軍行政費力求樽節</p>
<p>國民六日華盛頓電　美國雖仍贊成減縮軍備、其執政不日即將與英法當軸面談此事、顧今日國會内情形顯已切實趨向於建造新艦、衆院海軍委員會主席文生今日曾進見海軍總長史潢生、商榷其造艦程序、聞史氏對於下年度内需撥四千六百萬元之計劃、大體表示贊同、謂國會若能通過此造艦預算、渠將甚爲欣慰、且除史文兩氏會商造艦程序之外、今日又有參議員德拉美爾提出一案、規定開造新艦、以達到條約限度、刻已移交參院海軍委員會審查、惟海軍行政費以一面力求樽節、前任總統與現總統所命之節省經費辦法、業於今目以海軍部令實行、嗣後各海軍船塢每週將工作五日半、受其影響者共達四萬四千人、凡管理建造修理之軍官及所有士兵與非軍職雇員等、皆須一體遵行、惟此令並不足以減少海軍效能、實際上及可維持現有之員額、否則將不免有裁減之舉云、</p>
<p>國民六日華盛頓電　參議員德拉美爾今日提出造艦新案、特别規定一九二九年至少籌撥四千六百萬元、就一九二九年通過建造之巡洋艦十五艘中、開造五艘、皆屬一萬噸巡洋艦、裝六吋徑砲、又規定建造飛機母艦二艘、以代舊艦、一萬噸巡洋艦備具航空甲板者一艘、以代不</p>

<p>一息尚存决不許敵越雷池一步</p>
<p>刻警戒線已展至口外二十餘里</p>
<p>申時電訊社本埠消息、華北第二軍團總指揮商震代表程起陸氏、甫由戰地南旋、對於冷口血戰經過、均所目擊、兹因民衆對於該軍作戰經過、及防禦情形、雖經電告、而詳細情形、仍多隔膜、前日特由京抵滬、擬定期向地方協會等各團體、報告冷口殲敵經過、申時社記者、特往旅邸訪問、當蒙延見、並將該軍一切作戰經過、逐一詳告、兹特分述於後、</p>

<p>冷口爲華北全綫之右翼、亦爲通平之要道、若冷口有失、平津即受威脅、同時左翼之古北口、正面之喜峯口、均有被包抄之虞、是以冷口亦佔此次軍事上之重要地位、迨承德失守、冷口同時亦告陷落、時商總指揮已奉軍分會命、擔任右翼總指揮、於四日聞冷口失陷消息後、即飭該軍之黄光華師、兼程北進、於六日到達冷口附近、敵已由二百餘人、增加至千餘人、裝甲汽車已由十餘輛增至數十輛、並雜以僞軍步砲各軍、更構築堅固陣地、以圖扼守冷口要隘、</p>

<p>工廠檢查推行租界</p>
<p>改革警政難遽實行</p>
<p>征收地價稅已籌備</p>

<h3 id="c94">工廠檢查 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>據俞氏云、工廠檢查進行、迭經本人向工部局總裁費信惇磋商後、對於我方協助一點、可以同意、惟辦法方面、要求我方派已有訓練之檢查人才、歸租界方面支配、但工廠法爲國民政府所頒佈、市政府奉令辦理、此種要求、實係妨碍我行政權、况租界市民、當然秉承中國政府之命令、受中國政府之保護、故中國政府之行政權、當然可以推行於租界、庶華租兩界同一待遇、因是之故、尚未有相當結果、現據租界當局表示、此項問題、將於本屆西人納稅人年會修改洋涇浜章程中辦理之、但洋涇浜章程中、亦明白規定、修改條文、亦必得中國政府之同意、方能生效云、</p>
<h3 id="c95">警政制度 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>改革警政制度、前文局長曾有此提案、嗣因冬防時期、未予實行、兹據俞氏表示、謂警政制度改革之進行、現尚未至實施時期、蓋因一方面閘北各區、忙於整理復興、同時欲先將警察力量充實、並增加訓練工夫、一俟此兩點工作完竣、然後方能實施改革、至於公安局遷往舊上海縣址一事、因現在正將縣址修葺中、恐尚稍需時日、</p>
<h3 id="c96">稅收進行 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>娱樂捐自財政局長向租界當局辦理交涉後、現尚未有相當結果、故尚難開征、營業稅在停頓中、征收地價稅之籌備、業已完全就緒、開征日期、現尚未有確定、但不久必可實現云、</p>
<h3 id="c97">復興情形 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>復興本市繁榮計劃、自撥欵辦理以來、積極進行、幹道之修築、以及市立圖書館醫院等、皆已次第實施、進行頗速、市中心區方面市政府大厦及各幹道、亦將分别完成、惟全部工程、總須至本年終完畢、故市政府各機關之遷移、前雖有七月中可以實現、但就事實觀察、亦當在要年終矣、</p>

<p>、及大水災等、據渠所見、中國實有偉大之前途、渠固不僅對於中國前途、且對於全世界前途、均有甚深之信任、渠認英人責任、在協同其他民族、决意向理智與進步兩方面、努力邁進、以利他人、而已亦獲有巨大光榮、中國今日最大需要、端在淸理債務與恢復信用、苟不致力於此兩端、則將不能有巨大之發展、惟渠信目下柄政者、正謁誠注意於此云云、又會長馬歇爾致辭、則首述中國外患内憂之影響、而仍能平衡預算、次即剖析去年中外貿易情形謂美國在中外貿易中、居第一位、占百分之二一·一六、日本居第二位、占百分之一七·○七、英國占第三位、占百分之一○·○七、香港居第四位、占百分之八·七一、惟香港之對華貿易、當然有一大部份代表中英貿易、嗣乃對於鐵道部淸理債務與謀鐵路之進步、海關進口貨標註華文原産國名新章、中國人民購買力、與築路、救災、及發展運輸便利等、均有論列、又論及中國之商務工業、吾人須知此邦面積、幾類於一洲、人口衆多、但每人之平均財富、非常細小、故其物質進步、苟以面積與人口相比、固屬遲緩、但與每人之平均富力相比、則尚並非若是之遲緩云云、是日俟通過報告、改選新董後、即閉會、接開英僑中國協會年會、</p>

<p>丨本埠康腦脫路自由農塲尤懷臯先生來信丨</p>
<p>我是絶端主張回到鄉村中去建設的人。所以前天看見農村裏回得去嗎﹂一個問題，我就很高興的來替申報回答，來替雄聲君設計。雄聲君的回音還没有聽到，倒看見了劉思明先生一封駁覆我的信。我很佩服他的熱忱，我又感激他的關心。我不但要勸有心回到農村裏去的雄聲君到鄉村中去建設，我並且竭力勸告全國大中學生，畢業以後，每人費一年的工夫，替國家來建設農村。這篇文章，已經在申報上繼續發表了十五天，不知劉先生曾經讀過麽？如若没有，我有單印本在此奉送，那麽劉先生可以明瞭我不是一個﹁資本家﹂。所以我不但要﹁試試﹂，並且要﹁實行﹂，不但要我一個人去實行，我主張要大家去實行。因爲﹁試試﹂是缺乏經騐操切從事之謂，試得不好，就要回來，﹁實行﹂是研究有素，確有把握，而與以實行之謂。毅然進行，志在成功。吾學的是農，行的是農，十四年來未嘗離開一步我農的職業。我親自看見過英，美，法，德，俄的農家。我交際過數個外國農家子弟的同學。我曾經在外國鄉村中經過幾個月的實習。回國後十幾年來也曾到過很多的農村。讀過很多關於中國農村的書報。目覩着農民的痛苦，最痛心的就是農民一代一代的没有敎育。倘然有了敎育，决不致天災人禍閙個不休，也不致目前的如此束手無策。吾要實行吾的計劃，必須要從培養人才入手。所以我在龍華新塲上，設立一個訓練鄉村師資，及農工領袖，的機關，秋間就要成立。在蘇州本鄉也要設立幾個鄉村小學。近來又資助一人在北新涇陳更村設立一個鄉村小學。這不是﹁試﹂到是﹁實行﹂據我個人看來，中國當前的大敵，到不單單是日本的侵略是問題，還三萬數千萬農民的愚昧也是問題。打破這愚昧的工作，恐怕要比戰勝日本還要難到百十倍。倘然我們有了敎育，只消有百份之一農民來抗日，百份之一農民作後備，百份之一農民來給養，恐怕日本也不敢如此横蠻罷。我最不歡迎的一句話，就是說人是理想與幻想。因爲這是没志氣，没勇氣，少智識，缺毅力，的人所說的話！水火天空。尚能征服，難道我們衣食出處的鄉村就不敢進去麽？試問那一種事實不是從理想中出來？望劉先生切記着﹁理想者事實之母﹂，失敗者成功之機﹂的兩句話。可惜大多數人没有理想，所以事實就少見了！目下中國雖然缺少樂土，但是像湖南，山東，廣東，廣西，貴州，浙江，等省，對於各種建設，均有極大的進步。（請參觀全國敎育社會經費統計表）。中國要比日本大十六倍，所以東三省的被日本暫時佔據，江西的經年匪禍，其餘各省還是安陸仲安·方仁麟·胡叔異·范守淵·葉國魂·等多人担任指導、又該部服務時間係每日下午一時至六時、地點在三馬路石路口綢業大樓四○五至六號、</p>

<p>居樂業。所以我仍舊勸雄聲君儘管努力的去建設他的桃花源。我不主學劉先生空言抗日的停止工作坐候凱旋的主張。我的新式的桃花源，是一種農村的準。因爲鄉村中缺少的是識字能文的領袖人物，所以我的主張，要都市中志士仁人，到鄉村中去領導農民來改造建設，解除痛苦。絶對不是﹁避世！﹂乃是﹁入世。﹂因爲雄聲君在都市中没有他的地位，所以我勸他離都市的世而入鄉村的世。與孟浩然的踏雪尋梅，陶淵明的飲酒賞菊，絶然不同。新式的桃花源，是一個交通便利，科學生産，有敎育，重衛生，優美純潔的鄉村。在十八世紀中葉的法國，有一個鄉村模範的牧師，呌做吳伯苓（Ｏberliu），他是一個係雄聲君同樣赤貧的人。他在德，法，瑞三國交錯中間的地方，久遭兵匪蹂躪民生凋零的境内，來實行傳敎與敎書。他的錢也是求來與借來的，他的食品，是麵包與水和鹽。經他畢生的努力工作，就造成了他的桃花源。還有一個比國的大犧牲家，他的名字呌達米（Damiew），他隻身到南洋羣島麻瘋病最盛的地方去傳敎與救濟病人。十六年後，他自己也傳染着惡疾因爲他犧牲的緣故，後來的人竟把這一處地方的麻瘋病消滅了。這個義士也造成了他的意想中的桃花源。我並不是基督徒，但是我很敬慕他們的精神。各國的鄉村的興盛，由於敎育，敎育的發達與成功，還是由於學者志士的肯犧牲。所以我還要請劉先生從此改變思想，要積極樂觀，要努力進趨！美國目下的恐慌，因爲歐洲戰時戰後的特殊市塲，鼓動了美國全國農工業的勃興，等到後來市塲特變了，所以産生了今日生産過剩的情狀。現在　總統，已在發行二十萬萬元公債來貸欵與農民，不久總可回復原狀，决非我國的窮困農村不得同日而語。所以劉先生的歸罪於鄉村敎育，完全根本錯誤。美國農民有一百二十萬萬元債務，但是他們有千萬萬元價值的農田，房屋，牛羊，機器，及堆積如山的農産，依然存在。他們是一時的週轉不靈，非眞眞的空虚可比。所以請劉先生不必替美國農家擔憂，還得要替我國貧苦農民設計。雄聲君到鄉村去，我果然替雄聲君來解决他個人的生活，同時也很希望雄聲君到鄉村中去做些益國惠民的工作。這就是我發表﹁農村裏回得去嗎﹂的本意。望劉先生切勿認我做一個喜唱高調，好出風頭，呌人入甕，自己逍遙，的一個理想家。劉先生還說，上層分子多勢利貪財，店員工人還是誠實無欺，不免有些武斷，須知善惡智愚，無處不有，絶對不能拿貧賤富貴來作標準。我說鄉民是比較的誠實，是相對的，不是絶對的。末了，我還要聽聽劉先生對雄聲君所提出的﹁農村裏回得去嗎﹂的意見。</p>
<p>記者按：關於﹁農村裏回得去嗎﹂一問題，自本埠自由農塲尤懷臯先生來信參加討論後，即有本埠劉思民君來信提出反對的意見；（見五日七日本欄）兹又接尤懷臯先生來函，對於劉思民君質問有所解釋，並列舉其主張農村敎育救國論之理由，頗有研究價值。尤先生復希望劉君繼續有所商榷，劉君一定還有高見發表，我們也且等着罷。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>這椿笑話，是從宴會席上聽來的，其中有一位令人佩服的乂姑娘，簡直是打破單戀的棒喝黨。</p>
<p>乂姑娘打從學校裏回家，走上胥門外碼頭的擺渡船，費着一銅元的代價擺到對岸，便可以縮短相當的路程。這天，船頭上立着一個靑年男子，爲着心醉伊的秀色，目不轉瞬的看伊一個飽。這眞險極了！萬年橋的橋洞裏，陡然開出一隻單放輪船，很平穏的河面，霎時激起凹凸的波浪！船頭上呆立的少年，一時站足不穏，正待要跌入波心，而旁邊怱伸出一隻玉腕，把他緊緊抱住。才不曾一聲撲通，跌入了水晶宫。</p>
<p>登岸後，少年感激涕零的謝伊救命大恩，伊只微微一笑，很怱促的去了。後來，少年希圖再遇乂姑娘，但聞伊已轉學杭州，竟無重見的機會。少年已娶有家室，姿色遠遜乂姑娘；於是，日夕渴想芳容，病懨懨早成爲單戀症了！治單戀的藥餌，只有和乂姑娘相逢，伊若是不來，一納頭便是憔悴死！少年的母和妻，都抱着無窮的憂慮；風聞，乂姑娘春假返里，便登門去央求，只須伊肯來省視病人，少年的病可大有起色。</p>
<p>乂姑娘起着不忍心，眞個來慰問病人；來一次，病减幾分。到第三次，少年已可脫離病榻了。乂姑娘說：﹁三天後再來臨問，來時，當手煮佳餚，以助病人健淡。﹂少年聽說，又感激出許多涕涙來。</p>
<p>三天後，豔若神仙的乂姑娘來了。手煮的佳餚，是紅燒白燒的蹄膀各一次，俗稱金銀蹄膀。少年的食慾正高，又加以﹁美人之貽，﹂當然可以大嚼而特嚼了；但是，伊要少年辨别兩股蹄膀的滋味，先令他緊閉雙目，伊夾一些金膀　給少年道：﹁其味如何？﹂少年道：﹁很好。﹂又夾一些銀膀道：﹁這樣呢？﹂少年道：﹁也是很好。﹂伊緊問一句道：﹁有兩般滋味麽？﹂人答：﹁只是一般。﹂</p>
<p>怱的織纖玉手上發着一個掌心雷，他的面上已結實的着了一下；接着，嚦嚦鶯聲般的嗔駡道：﹁你旣知蹄膀没有兩股滋味，難道女人有兩般滋味麽？﹂說罷，伊便不顧而去。</p>

<p>我没有嘗試過婚禮的滋味，是舊的，感是新的。</p>
<p>不過當我每次觀光親友們舉行婚禮的時候，總是看見那麽一套；﹁新郎新婦在禮堂當中很侷促的站着，好像等候法律的裁判，於是證婚人就要發出一篇郎才女貌百年好合的大評論來，隨後主婚人說過兩句包涵原諒的客套話以後，接連就是長於口材的來賓們致詞了，他們當着男女大衆，會說出許力下層多﹁努工作﹂﹁加緊製造國民﹂的不穏話來，於是來賓們會像看見卓别麟的影片似的一樣的喧笑！最後由新郎新婦鞠躬致謝，這使人難堪的婚禮才算告一段落。﹂</p>

<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>人們生活在世上，究竟有甚麽意義和滋味，這一個﹁謎﹂，恐怕澈底解决的是很少。爲吃飯而生活嗎？禽獸何嘗不爲飲食。爲生殖而生活麽？禽獸也何嘗为知道交尾。爲富貴而生活麽？究竟達到目的的很少！假使達到了目的，恐怕富貴的人，比貧賤的人，還要煩惱。爲金錢而生活麽？一個人不能夠百年不死，多了錢，也打不來海底籬笆。陶淵明說得好，﹁人生無百年，徒懷千載憂。﹂便是這個道理。那末，人生是毫没﹁意義﹂和﹁滋味﹂啊！</p>
<p>各人有各人的﹁人生觀，﹂這便是各人對於人生，有各人的﹁意義﹂和﹁滋味；﹂所以社會不得不起了許多糾紛，天下也從此多事，像日本人是抱着毒蛇猛獸的人生觀；殘暴狠惡，覺得最有滋味。中國人抱着猪羅的人生觀，　頇懦弱，覺得最有滋味；或的抱着　蝂的人生觀，貪婪自利，覺得最有滋味；或的抱着耗子的人生觀，懦怯畏葸，覺得最有滋味。嗜好不同，胃口各異；所以﹁人生觀﹂也不止一種了。</p>
<p>頇，畏怯，懦弱，欺騙，自私自利，驕矜，奢侈，安逸，是最配中國人胃口的嗜好品，也很像生活上的味精，有了以上幾件美德，生活便不嫌枯寂，心身便感覺舒泰，這不是做了生活上的味精麽？豈知日本人把侵略，進攻，殘暴，兇狠········來調和他們的烹飪，這種味精，在生活上是很有意義的。食品中所加的味精，性質根本不同，自然﹁國民性﹂也因之而異了。</p>
<p>我們生在今日内憂外患的中國，第一，先要根本改變嗜好，換換胃口，快把﹁勇敢﹂﹁勤儉﹂﹁急公﹂﹁好義，﹂來做生活上的味精，覺得吃了極有滋味，能夠强筋骨，益智慧，成功世界上的偉大民族；千萬别把﹁　頇﹂﹁畏怯﹂﹁自私﹂﹁自私﹂﹁驕奢﹂﹁淫逸，﹂做了生活上的味精啊！</p>

<p>趙翁道：我不信省錢，省錢作什麽，我帶到棺材裏去用嗎？你去罷，别在大雪地裏躭誤，走快些，身上也好出點熱氣。趙自强答應着出去了。趙翁關了風門，在玻璃窗裏，向外看了一會雪景，又繼續的看他的三國演義。看到小說上打仗的事情，心理便想着，兒子當個連長，連長在一營裏，不算小，可是眞到上萬人打仗的時候，犧牲一個連長，那簡直算不了一回事。想到這裏，小說看不下了，在這大門口，遙遙的可以看到西苑大營，就穿了皮馬褂，走向大門口來。由楊家院子門口經過，聽到桂枝道：後院趙連長爺兒倆眞好。我聞到這陣牛肉香，我心裏就難過。江氏道：你難過什麽？桂枝道：我就不能買兩斤牛肉，煨湯你喝嗎？趙翁聽了這話，心裏又非常的感動。到了下午，牛肉湯煨得好了，就用瓦鉢子盛了大半鉢，呌小林把桂枝請了來，因笑道：大姑娘，你的心眼兒眞不壞，我這裏有點兒湯，你帶回去，送給你媽喝罷。桂枝道：喝！這那成丨這是趙連長孝敬您的，我們怎好拿去？趙翁道：没關係！我們孩子買得起牛肉，你只買得起蘿蔔。這湯裏有我們的牛肉，有你們的蘿蔔，照我們的力量來說，我們這合股公司，出的力就差不多，照理你該分一半，桂枝笑道：那能那樣說？趙翁走近一步，低聲道：你都聞見牛肉湯香了，你媽就不聞見嗎？你爲了這一點，也應當帶了回去給你媽嘗嘗。你要知道：我不是送你東西吃，我是凑合你那一分兒孝心啦。這句話可把桂枝的意思打動了，就向趙翁半蹲身子，請了個安，笑道：那可謝謝了。說畢就端了這鉢牛肉湯去了。這一鉢牛肉湯，却惹起江氏一個新發生的計畫，人生的悲歡離合，總是這樣，起因是在一點點兒小事的。（三五）</p>

<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>西班牙舞女</p>
<p>在街頭櫉窗裏，掛着一幀穿着長裙鬟間揷一叢鮮花的女人照片，呈現在我眼前的，是AsuncionGranados西班牙舞女兼琵琶名手，假座夏令配克戲守獻藝，座價五元，三元，二元，日期四月三日，五日，七日，十一日，時間下午九點十五分還幾行英吉利字。</p>
<p>看手裏執着的大晚報，知道今夜是這位著名舞女第二次獻技的日子。正在默想間，横斜裏過來一個黑衣人，旋頭一着：</p>
<p>﹁啊！麥歇安邵﹂！</p>
<p>﹁哦！密斯脫張﹂！</p>
<p>﹁你一向好﹂？</p>
<p>﹁倷一向好﹂？</p>
<p>﹁到那裏去﹂？</p>
<p>﹁没有事，在街上散散步，等一下想去看﹁阿傷心，葛蘭娜桃﹂的跳無﹂。</p>
<p>﹁巧極了，我也預備去看﹂。</p>
<p>﹁那好極了，我已經買了兩張票子我送一張給你吧﹂。</p>
<p>﹁怎麽？你不陪夫人同去嗎？我便不客氣謹領謝謝了﹂。</p>
<p>九點十五分，我和麥歇安邵，同坐在夏令配克戲院裏，我的號碼是Ｈ十一號，票根上印着StallsS5·00</p>
<p>惟啟，台上是一幅没有光澤的黑幕，左右兩個金色ＡＧ兩個字母，環以嘉禾式的花圈，下邊是希臘神話中的女人，或舞蹈，或奏樂。左角放着一隻三角尾形的黑色大鋼琴，完全像是一個追悼會的情景，中央祇缺少了一幀先總理，或烈士的遺像。</p>
<p>出來一個雪白襯衫黑色晚禮服的西班牙男人，並非是說明人，他一坐到琴前，便知道那是鋼琴師帥剌諾JoseSerrano氏。序曲旣畢，幕後跳出了一個完全是西班牙裝飾的少女，伊的愛嬌的臉，優美的姿態，妖媚的眼波，艶麗的服裝，比廣告上印着的照相更來得魅誘動人。在兩小時中，葛蘭娜桃表演十八種的單人獨舞。舞姿和服飾，每舞不同，伊是不像一般銀幕上習見的玉腿舞，若使要想在伊身體舞動時候去欣賞音樂的節奏，或者等伊舞得香汗涔涔想嗅得一種强烈的香味，那祗好去看鄧肯，或妲尼香二位，舞星的舞姿，這兩種特點，葛蘭娜桃是表演不來的。</p>
<p>這一夜，我在上海第一次看到完全用西班文的節目單，這位西班牙舞女兼琵琶名手，一共表演十八個節目。其中以﹁西班牙小夜曲﹂，﹁痛苦者﹂，ElDelirio等爲最好。</p>
<p>阿傷心，葛蘭娜桃惟一的優點，是在伊的一雙美麗靈活的手臂，伊握着兩個木魚式的西班牙特殊樂器，擊出一連串淸脆的聲音，擊得驟急時，聲聲深搥着你的心弦。在淡靑的電光中，伊全身旋轉舞動的當兒，一雙赤裸着的手臂，左右上下像兩條白鯉鰻般地泅游跳躍，可以使你目眩。舞到最高潮的當見，伊的長裙，像張開陽傘般地鹿放開來，露出一雙雪白粉嫩的赤裸脛，可以呌人心跳。伊愈舞愈興奮，寛大的長裙，偶然會像汽球般地飛舞到腰際，裙下隠約没有腿管的粉紅式的短褲，台下便有人怪呌一聲Ｂravo，伊也送了妖艶的微笑。</p>
<p>葛蘭娜桃有一個粗闊的腰肢，一個隆起的肚腹，這是無法可改善的兩大缺點。還有，伊穿長裙，喜穿高跟皮鞋，從頭到底只用一隻鋼琴伴奏，這些都要使伊的舞藝减色不少。</p>
<p>葛蘭娜桃，在上海亦不受到觀衆的歡迎，是一件意料中事。</p>

<p>— 振之</p>
<p>眞空管而需要燈絲，實是眞空管的缺點。因爲有了燈絲，眞空管就有一定的壽命。於是用離化氣體來發生電子的方法，就爲無線電界研究的鵠的。這工作在德國已經費了不少的努力。這里所介紹的，乃是美國亨德博士最近完成的無線眞空管，（又名冷陰極眞空管）。</p>
<p>已經完成的無絲眞空管有一極，兩極，三極各種。至於四極五極以及六極七極等，在理論上都可作成。兹就三極無絲眞空管一種，加以說明，以例其餘。</p>
<p>左圖是三極管的外形，下圖示其内部構造。燈泡内充滿稀有氣體，Ａ爲陽極，Ｂ爲陰極，用高電壓的電池和一定量電阻器完成一電路。此電阻器所以限</p>
<p>制管内的電流，否則因離化氣體的電阻太低電流將達到一過大之值。今將電池連接於ＡＢ兩極，極間即發生一美麗的電弧，封入氥的燈泡作粉紅色，封入氦的燈泡作紫色。這弧光即由於被加電壓所解離的陽離子和電子衝突而成。Ｃ是一個穿有多數小孔的圓筒，（圖中只畫一孔）套在弧極的外面。Ｄ是栅極，Ｅ是屏極。其作用如下；有陽電荷的圓筒，所以遲緩陽電荷離子的速度，不使擾及圓筒與屏極間的電子流。於是放在電子流中途的栅極得以完全控制燈泡的作用，和普通的三極管一樣。</p>
<p>此種眞空管具有各種機能，如振盪，擴大，調幅，檢波等，均能勝任。預計在一年之後，市上當可見此種商品出現。</p>
<h3 id="c206">選擇性很好的鑛石收音機 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>誰都知道，礦石收音機的製造簡易，所費又很少，置備以後，就可以永久使用，不必再化半文寃錢，所視爲最可惜的，就是聲音太弱，收音的成績欠佳。而選擇性不好，也是一個大缺點。前者簡直除了用眞空管外，没有什麽改良辦法，後者比較容易解决些，最近的日用機械雜誌（PopularMachanics）上，刊載有幾只選擇性很好的礦石收音機的製法，譯者曾經逐一試騐過，覺得成績還不差，特爲譯述於下。</p>
<p>（一）甲機丨如圖甲</p>
<p>過一只礦石機，並没有什麽特異的地方，就不過線圈關係，Ｌl爲初級圈，Ｌa爲次級圈，同時繞在一只長三英寸半，直徑二英寸的膠木管上，用二十六號漆包線，初級圈繞二十三圈，次級圈繞七十二圈，Cl容最爲00035MFDＣ２容量爲００１ＭＦＤ圖中虚線表示用否隨便，須視試騐之結果如何而定，</p>
<p>（二）乙機丨丨如圖乙</p>
<p>這一只礦石機上，多一只濾波器，所以選擇性能夠增加，用件之容量大小等，亦有有出入。</p>
<p>濾波器的線圈（TrapCoil）係繞在一只長三英寸直徑一英寸半的膠木管上，用二十六號漆包線繞九十四圈，Cl之容量爲０００５ＭＦＤ初級圈Ｌ及次級圈Ｌ２繞在同一長２１－２英寸直徑４１－４英寸的膠木管上，用三十二號漆包線，初級圈繞十七圈，次級圈繞一百零七圈，Ｃ２容量爲０００５ＭＦＤＣ３容量爲００２ＭＥＤ　　第一件事應當注意的，就是礦石機需要良好的天地線，據著者說，這二只收音機，用了精美的天地線，在芝加哥試騐時，很有驚人的成績，由此，我們知道，天地線的影響於礦石收音機，實非淺鮮，</p>
<p>末了，我希望研究無線電的同志，能夠從小的機件着手，須知道，不一定十幾燈的收音機，方有興趣，一只小小的礦石機，同時或許也能給你一個滿足的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c207">濾波器 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 企堯</p>
<p>無線電播音臺日多，空中無線電波亦愈形複雜，所以普通一隻收音機，在每一度轉盤（Ｄial）上差不多都可以收到一家的播音；有時一度上，同時可以收到兩家的播音，結果，互相騷擾，常常把很好的節目搗亂，没有方法去領受，濾波器就能校正這種弊病，能夠把不要聽的節目或其他的播音濾去。</p>
<p>濾波器的種類，實用上大槪可分三種：第一種是高界濾波器（HighPassFllter）其作用能使高於某週率之電流通過，低於某，週率者濾去；第二種是低界濾波器（LowPassFiler）其作用適與上述者相反；第三種是選界濾波器（BandＰassＦilter）其作用能使某週率至某週率一定界限内的電流通過，較小或較大者一槪濾去。</p>
<p>濾波器構逢　拿線圈及電容器串聯或並聯而成。收音機上最常用的濾波器如圖所示。能將最近的電臺聲音減低。原理如下：</p>
<p>慢有兩個不同週率ＦIF2之電波，感應天線而生電流J1I2在abcd電路内通行，因ＬＣ電路的本身振盪週率與Ｆl相等時，則電流Il爲最小，因Ｆl與Ｆ２的週率不同，故ＬＣ同時不能使Ｆ２亦爲最小，如此ＬＣ電路可以把電流Ｉ１濾去；而能使電流Ｉ２單獨通過。</p>
<p>製造濾波器，非常簡單，先預備直徑約２时至２·５吋的硬紙圓筒一個，外用２４號包皮銅線繞約五六十圈，就成一個感應圈；再用·０００５uf或·０００２５uf的變量電容器一個，如上圖裝置，一端接天線，一端接收音機的天線柱上，使用的方法，也很簡單，譬如轉盤在某度的時候，同時能夠聽到ＡＢＩ一臺的播音，倘使我們要濾去Ａ臺的播音，那末，先把轉盤慢慢的轉動，使Ａ臺的播音配諧到最響的地位，然後再轉動濾波器的變量電容量，使Ａ臺的播音最低，以至絶滅的地方，這樣我們再聽Ｒ臺或他臺的播音，不會受到Ａ臺的騷擾了。</p>

<p>玩直流電收音機的同好，每苦於日常購電過於靡費，這裏有一只最經濟的代乙電，應用的材料如下，要是電源變壓能夠自繞，則總費約在十四五元之譜，Ｔ爲電源變壓器，初級係二百或一百弗打直接在電燈撲落上，次級可有二三個，一隻是供給整流管屏栅連極的高壓線圈約需二百弗。一隻是供給該管燃絲極的五弗低壓線圈，其餘都留作甲電而用，至於設計自然要看收音機的眞空管而定了。Ｖ即通常屏流略大些的眞空管就適用，如２０１，５０９，１７１之類。Ｌ是濾波用的低週扼制線圈（AudioFrequencyChoke）可用次級尚好的低週變壓器來代Ｃ１Ｃ２都是二兆分法拉特（ＭＦＤ）固定電容器，Ｃ３也是一樣，不過容量祇有一兆分法拉特也夠，Ｒ是四萬歐姆的電阻，也可用五支光電燈泡來代，牠無非把乙電壓降落些供檢波級使用，乙負（Ｂ·）最好通以地線，可令交流聲減至極微，此項代乙電輸出的高電壓約一百六七十弗·所以日常三四管直流收音機都可使用了。</p>

<p>國貨無綫電機新出品　福煦路三九三號建華電機公司製造部一九三三年度出品，有五瓦特無綫電收發電報電話兩用機。積二年餘之研究，其改良之處甚多，試騐成績甚佳。聞該機爲手提箱式，收發機均裝置於一箱之内，報話並用。周圍面積不到二方尺。輕便無比，實爲軍用旅行飛機上極便利之用品也。</p>
<p>又建華公司編輯部一九三三年出版各種書籍，除無線電新公約已經出版外　其餘如﹁交流收音機槪要﹂﹁乾電池蓄電池充電器﹂﹁短波發報機﹂均在最近四五六月中按時出版，閒該書内容甚爲豐富，尤注重於製造及修理方面云。</p>
<p>修理破舊顚空管　無綫電機各種材料中之最重要且價值最鉅者爲眞空管。發報眞空管每隻價值有高至二三千元以上者，一旦燬壞，損失不資。上海三馬路九號，大華無線電公司最近發明一種修理方法，凡發報眞空管出力在五十華脫以上乃至二十基羅華脫者，均能修理，保證完好。保證方法分爲三種，一爲效率，二爲壽命，三爲出力均與新出品無異。取價公道。凡有破舊眞空管請送往該公司接洽。惟收報眞空管則槪不修理云。</p>
<p>亞達公司修理部近訊　本埠仁記路二十五號，亞達公司，自特設無線電收音機修理部以來，對於服務成績，極有可觀。凡各界之前往委托修理收音機者，極爲擁擠。良以該公司辦事認眞，管理嚴密；關於各種修理儀器，設備完善。而復請前任開洛公司，惠勒公司無線電總工程師，徐志方君，主理其事。學理與經騐並重，無論各種收音機，發生嚴重困難，悉能迎刄而解。以故工作雖極繁忙，而交貨甚爲迅速。又若以電話通知，請其外出修理，該公司亦當於一小時内趕到。際此滬上各界，正感覺不易覓得妥善之收音機修理處所時，若該公司之服務辦法，誠於各界之購置收音機者便利不少也。</p>

<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>從我有記憶的時候起，直到現在，凡我所曾經到過的地方，在空地上，常常看見有﹁變把戲﹂的，也呌作﹁變戲法﹂的。</p>
<p>這變戲法的，大槪只有兩種丨丨</p>
<p>一種，是敎一個猴子戴起假面，穿上衣服，要一通刀槍；騎了羊跑幾圈。還有一匹用稀粥養活，已經瘦得皮包骨頭的狗熊玩一些把戲。末後是向大家要錢。</p>
<p>一種，是將一塊石頭放在空盒子裏，用手巾左蓋右蓋，變出一隻白鴿來；還有將紙　在嘴巴裏，點上火，從嘴角鼻孔裏冒出烟燄。其次是向大家要錢。要了錢之後，一個人嫌少，裝腔作勢的不肯變了，一個人來勸他，對大家說再五個。果然有人抛錢了，於是再四個，三個······</p>
<p>抛足之後，戲法就又開了塲。這回是將一個孩子裝進小口的罐子裏面去，只見一條小辫子，要他再出來，又要錢。收足之後，不知怎麽一來，大人用尖刀將孩子剌死了，蓋上被單，直挺挺躺着，要他活過來，又要錢。</p>
<p>﹁在家靠父母，出家靠朋友······ＨuazalHuazal﹂變戲法的裝出撒錢的手勢，嚴肅而悲哀的說。</p>
<p>别的孩子，如果走近去想仔細的看，他是要駡的；再不聽，他就會打。</p>
<p>果然有許多人Ｈuaza了。待到數目和預料的差不多，他們就檢起錢來，收拾傢伙，死孩子也自己爬起來，一同走掉了。</p>
<p>看客們也就獃頭獃腦的走散。</p>
<p>這空地上，暫時是沉寂了。過了些時，就又來這一套。俗語說，﹁戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。﹂其實是許多年間，總是這一套，也總有人看，總有人Ｈuaza，不過其間必須經過沉寂的幾日。</p>
<p>我的話說完了，意思也淺得很，不過說：大家ＨuazaHusza一通之後，又要靜幾天了，然從再來這一套。</p>
<p>到這里我才記得寫錯了題目，這眞是成了﹁不死不活﹂的東西。</p>
<h3 id="c213">深夜的漫步 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>在白天會是一條很熱閙的街道的，在晚上却很靜悄。兩旁的店舗，除了問或有一二家開通宵的以外，全關着；人行道上則錯綜地忽陰忽現着雜亂的光，那來自桿上的，來自線下的，來自屋中的，或者有時，來自月亮的。</p>
<p>獨自漫步於這樣的情景之下，會使你想起許多你已忘却了的事情：或眼的一脥，或手的一握，或頭的一搖。可是，想到這一切，彷彿是想到别人的事情似地，那在這些事情初發生時所嘗感到過的喜或怒的情緒，不會重臨到你，至多，你只會會心地一笑，你那靈魂與你那思念的會心。</p>
<p>這樣地漫步，你還會把你整個的身與心陷於空思中去，空得比虚無的夢還空的空思。你會想這次天明了，空中會有兩個太陽在那裏决鬥，或者這地球已在向西旋轉；你會想你的靈魂也許巳變成了别人的靈魂，或者你的身體確已不再是你自己的身體。你會想嚼鐵，想吞火，或者喝盡天下的水，使人感受到生的乾渴。</p>
<p>有時你有思路會給或車的兩眼射斷，可是，斷了，你也不會再想把它重延下去；或者說你已不再想起你剛才所在想的，而又會開始想起别的什麽，或者你就簡直不會理會到那對眼睛，即使理會到了，也會依舊延續着你的思路。你不再是你自己的主人，你的主人是思念自己。</p>
<p>還有時你忽然感到有或一别人在你的或前或後走着，而且還領悟到不知從什麽時候起他的步武已和你的一致，於是你便加速或者遲緩你的步武，使它和他的參差，而且一見到拐彎的地方你就拐彎，以便另開始又一獨自。</p>
<p>漫步於深夜所使你想起的會遠歧於你在别的什麽時候或者在别的情景中所會想起的。</p>

<p>丨丨一個鐘頭就夠了；而可悲的是，格萊絲，這事可以成功呢。</p>
<p>丨丨試試看罷。</p>
<p>丨丨可是我不會吹法螺。</p>
<p>丨丨那麽，我的孩子，凡是有人叩問你的究竟時，你可躊躇一會，你直對着問話者的鼻子噴出一大口烟，然後說出下面這很簡單的一句話：﹁你從來没有看過一條河嗎？﹂</p>
<p>丨丨這話是什麽意思呢？</p>
<p>丨丨毫没有什麽意思，格萊絲說，於是他們便會覺得你這話很漂亮，等到你已充分被他們發現，了解，讚揚的時候，我們便把這事的内幕揭穿，拿他們的狼狽情形來取樂。</p>
<p>○　　　○　　　○　　○</p>
<p>兩個月後，駝石畫展正式開幕之前一天的預備展覽完全成功了。有着如簧的婉轉的聲調，和滿身芳香的那美麗的科斯勒烏斯加夫人，再也不離開他的新偉人了。</p>
<p>丨丨啊丨她反覆呌說着，這種藝術的感受性，想像和力喲！怎樣的睿智，怎樣的啓示啊！可是，親愛的，你究竟怎樣達到了這樣驚人的綜合呢？</p>
<p>畫家躊躇了一會，噴出一大口烟，說道：﹁親愛的夫人，你從來没有瞧過一條河嗎？﹂</p>
<p>於是這美麗的波蘭女人的嘴唇感動着，以如簧的婉轉的聲調說出許多祝語。年靑而著名的勒威格，穿着兎皮領子的大衣，在一大羣人裏面爭論着：﹁眞厲利！眞厲利！我早就說過最卑劣的事情莫過於照着一個模型作畫。可是，駝石，告訴我，你這啓示是從那裏得來的？是從我的論文裏面得來的嗎？﹂</p>
<p>駝石着實躊躇了一會，對着他的鼻子噴出了一口勝利的烟，隨後說道：﹁先生，你從來没有瞧過一條河嗎？﹂</p>
<p>丨丨好極了！勒威格表示贊許，好極了！</p>
<p>這時一個著名的晝商在畫室參觀了一遍，牽着畫家的衣袖，把他引到一隅。　　丨丨駝石，我的朋友，你眞是一個狡猾東西。這個大可以吹一下。請把你的作品都留給我罷。在我關照你以前，你不要變換畫法，我每年替你銷五十幅······行嗎？</p>
<p>駝石謎似的抽着烟，不置可否。</p>
<p>畫室慢慢地空了。等到最後一個參觀者出去之後，格萊絲走去把門關上，我們聽到樓梯上喃喃的讚歎聲漸漸遠了。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>﹁老曹呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁到老哈那邊去了。老哈一早就差了人來呌他。﹂</p>
<p>她笑着回答他。</p>
<p>﹁······林先生，請稍等一忽，我去倒水來給你揩面。﹂</p>
<p>﹁不、我自己會。﹂</p>
<p>他說着，一面穿外衣外褲，穿好了，就下床了。</p>
<p>﹁昨夜裏眞對不住了。﹂</p>
<p>好怱然臉紅紅的向他說。但他一點也摸不着頭緒，他想昨晚上她對自己並没有錯什麽事呀。</p>
<p>﹁什麽事？﹂</p>
<p>海泉驚疑着問。</p>
<p>﹁世光那個討厭的東西······﹂</p>
<p>她没有把話說下去便笑得很有趣般的。但海泉一點也笑不出來，他只是張開口呆望着她。﹁······我說，林先生在這裏，不該那樣的不正經，但世光還是，·······﹂</p>
<p>她更是臉紅紅的了。</p>
<p>海泉正在没有辦法的時候，忽然看見樓下二房東的娘姨送了一封信上來。</p>
<p>﹁林先生的信，一個小孩子送來的。﹂</p>
<p>海泉聽見，忙走出樓梯口，把那封信接了過來。他知道這是唐耀星寫來的，因爲他在前天告訴了唐耀星，暫以曹世光的住宅爲臨時通信越。他顫着手尖，拆開這封信來一看。</p>
<p>﹁下午Ｄemon，請參加。十二時在弟處集合。﹂</p>
<p>看見只Ｄemon這一個略筆字，他的四肢，和他的胸口一樣，搦搦地顫了起來。他想，唐耀星那天對他說的話，眞要實行了麽。這豈是可以當玩的一件事。啊！危險！危險！</p>
<p>﹁那天晚上，自己不該那樣糊裏糊塗把字簽下去的。自己内心是異常的怯懦。但在嘴巴上却說得非常的强硬。現在到了試騐的日子了。﹂</p>
<p>隨後祇剩着小說家和畫家兩人時，小說家快快活活地把兩手揷在口袋裏，爆發一聲駭人的大笑。駝石吃驚地瞧着他。　　丨丨你看丨我的孩子，格萊絲說，你不相信我們已經征服他們嗎？你聽到那穿着兎皮領大衣的小把戲的話嗎？還有那漂亮的波蘭女人的話呢？還有那三個年靑的美麗的姑娘再三說着：﹁這樣新喲！這樣新喲！﹂啊！駝石，我知道人類的冥頑是深不可測的，但這樣的結果究竟超過了我的期望。</p>
<p>他說完之後，重又笑不可抑。畫家縐着眉毛，當對方笑得回不過氣來時，突然說道：</p>
<p>丨丨你這蠢東西！</p>
<p>丨丨蠢東西！小說家憤激地呌着。當我成功了皮克修以來的一幅最美的漫畫·········</p>
<p>畫家帶着驕傲的神情把那二十幅分析肖像畫看了一眼，斷然說道：</p>
<p>丨丨是啦，格萊絲，你是一個蠢東西。這種畫裏面含着有一些東西······</p>
<p>小說家驚駭欲絶的凝視着他的朋友。　　丨丨這可了不得！他呌說，駝石，你記一記看。是誰把這新的畫法暗示給你的？</p>
<p>於是駝石躊躇了一會，噴出了一口濃烟：</p>
<p>丨丨你從來没有看過一條河嗎？（完）</p>

<p>— 克多</p>
<p>現在上海的摩登小姐們，太太們，女學生們，差不多没有一個不塗指抹粉，畫眉染髮的。當然，蛾眉淡掃，鬢髮蓬鬆，確實實增中了不少的人工的美麗，不過未免太麻煩了些。</p>
<p>在蘇聯的婦女中，很少用人工去點綴自己的美觀的。那些塗脂抹粉和畫眉燙髮的婦女，恐怕在一千個婦女中，也找不出一二人；而這一二人，也不過是那些非黨員與團員的戲子們，公使館領事署的太太小姐們，那些外國技術人員和工程師的妻女們，很不易見的操神女生涯的娼妓們。她們爲了博得所好者的歡心，所以要鈎心鬥角，打扮得花枝招展，就是花五十盧布的代價變髮一次，也在所不惜。</p>
<p>工廠和農塲的勞働婦女們，她們旣没有許多閑工夫修飾自己，亦不願意從事無謂的裝飾。﹁水晶簾下看梳妝﹂的深閨韻事，在蘇聯的確是不易找到的。她們在工作之餘，若不進識字班，圖書館，補習學校去讀書，便是去幹那些有益心身的運動，如打靶，游泳，滑冰之類。蘇聯男子們的理髮，也不像我們中國那些摩登的公子哥兒們效顰時髦的婦女，將頭髮燙成一鬈一曲。他們進理髮店去理髮，只要化十分鐘就夠了。理髮師也僅將長頭髮剪了些，在左右兩頰和上下顎刮了七八刀，這樣簡簡單單地就幹完了理髮的手續，决不會代理髮者洗面，取耳垢，梳頭，敲脊背，洒香水，塗雪花膏等。可是圍頸項的白布巾，和剃鬍子用的刷子等，用過一次，必須送到洗衣工廠去消毒以後，才准再用；否則便要受衛生局的處罰的。</p>

<h3 id="c276">英美衝突與戰債問題（倫敦通信）（三月三日） <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>英國張伯倫在里司演說、謂去年年底、美國曾發起召集債務會議、英國對於這次會議、　至今尚未正式表示接受、但於將來開會時、必先向會議提出兩點要求、完全於永遠勾銷戰債和由美國承認洛桑條約、關於這個問題、美國報紙曾大起反對、希爾斯特托拉斯屬下的﹁紐約美利堅﹂報、作時評嚴厲秤擊、爲反對聲中之最激烈者、該時評寫道、﹁張伯倫的說話、簡直是英國的恥辱、對於此種說話、應像對待旁的糊塗話一樣、只有置之不理、﹂上議院某議員且建議逮捕銜羅斯福命、與英法交涉局部取銷戰債、提議把戰債降低百分之七十五的巴里特、</p>
<p>洛桑條約表面上雖把德國賠欵﹁降﹂至三十萬萬馬克、但條約同時另有一條規定、即條約最後的執行、是以美國放棄戰債爲條件的、最近一次法國應付給美國的到期的戰債、至今還没有付、赫里歐并因爲贊成支付債欵之故、從而倒台、英國對美國經過去時期的交換通諜之後、算是把十二月份的債欵償還了、但曾同時聲明、這次償還是最後的一次償還、</p>
<p>美國感覺到債務國已結成聯合戰線的危險、一切債務國都藉口他們支付債欵、必得以德國支付賠欵爲轉移、爲主要的理由、他們并要求美國照洛桑條約﹁减低﹂德國賠欵的比例、減低或勾銷欠美國的戰債、美國則極力認爲德國支付賠欵與償還美國戰債完全没有關係、而主張支付戰債應以支付能力爲原則、實際上美國確曾打破了債務國根據洛桑條約所結成的丨丨遲遲結成的丨丨聯合戰線、英、</p>
<p>國和意大利自胡佛緩付通課發出後、又重新承認付欵、美國對於這種債務國則邀請他們作個别的債務談判、給他們以局部减低債欵的機會、爲承認付欵的﹁酬勞、﹂對於﹁不履行義務的﹂法國和對於未付到期債欵的波蘭、則並無邀請談判的舉動、</p>
<p>美國算是僥倖把債務國的聯合戰線打破了、然而在美國與英國的談判上又發生激勵的爭論、這種爭論見之於報端者、我們已經在上文略示一二了、這裏對於美國不僅是一個戰債數額的問題、雖然這個總是很可觀的、是幾十萬萬美金的數目、美國的要求、遠不止此、目前英·法·日在遠東、實際上已結成聯盟、而美國對外政策的努力、恰在遠東方面、因爲很孤立的原故、大受日本行動之威脅、所以美國極願借此作一種對外政策的有力的工具、此外美國且表示、願以英國政法的和經濟的交換條件、爲减低債務或勾銷債務的基礎、</p>
<p>美國認爲這種可能的另外的交換條件、首先是英國恢復金本位、第二是在英帝國市場上給美國生産品以優越稅則爲便利、第三是軍備問題上的讓步、第四是由英國憑藉英國的債權或英國的投資、給美國其他債務人以政治壓力、作外交上的援助、</p>
<p>現時英美衝突、由於戰債問題上意見的分歧、差不多露骨地曝露出來了、如果英國再不表示服從、則美國亦不惜對英國加以威脅、結果英國及其自治國對美的輸入、會繼續大受限制、美國現時即已嗾使他的保護國實行與南美洲英國的勢力開戰、以後美國在南美洲反英國勢力的行動之尖銳化更是意中事、</p>
<p>英國亦自不讓步、急謀相當的對策、事實上日本對中國的掠奪政策、大可給英國以充分的助力、就是張伯倫在里司的演說、也就己經提及、在可能範圍内、必須提高英國對美國的輸出或减少美國對英國的輸入、雖然張伯倫馬上聲明、說這决不是一個威嚇的問題、然而美國政府和與論却不因此而改變他們對於張伯倫演說的意見、</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌也和德國支付賠欵一樣、使各國不能支付美國戰債、物價之一般的慘跌、加重了付欵的責任、而一切債務國財政上的大虧空更使籌欵完全不可能、即令債欵能夠籌出、匯兌問題仍然成爲不可避免的障碍、因爲處處都有關稅壁壘、無法籌足必要的金額、這種困難更因美國收回外國日量的投資而益加擴大、　是美國舊能把對付一切債務國的重砲實行放射、强迫債務國支付債欵、那末洛桑條約便因此自然而然地自行取消、這就是說、楊格計劃之取銷是以洛桑條約之施行爲條件的、現在洛桑條約旣經無效、楊格計便重新有效了、</p>
<p>由此可見、整個帝國主義的衝突、由於英美戰債問題之尖銳化、已達到很高的程度、而且這種衝突是兩個舉足輕重的列强之衝突、是兩個列强鬭爭之主要戰線、</p>

<p>以三千萬揭遠之子虚駭聞，閧動全世，博得一﹁活財神﹂之頭銜的梁作友氏，忽又消聲歛跡了半年，原來他老先生是在閉門著作。，成就了一皇皇巨著的﹁節約　國計劃。﹂。可惜我們没有韓主席及張秘書長的洪禍，先睹全豹爲快！</p>
<p>據報載該﹁飭約救國計劃﹂，次致爲﹁成立立節約救國委員會，民選委員，設節約救國銀行，發行救國流通劵二十萬萬元﹂。左一句﹁救國﹂，右一句﹁救國。﹂，足證梁氏終是﹁熱心救國﹂之財神，才能寫出這樣﹁三句不離要行。﹂的﹁救國計劃。﹂。梁氏前在京曾有﹁一百零八日可收回東北失地﹂之誇言，則此計劃之價值，必等於九天玄女娘娘之無字天書。，自不待言。。無怪得之者將秘而不宣矣。。</p>
<p>雖然，梁氏豈眞是張角張寳者流，或染有神經病之人歟？蓋不然也。聽其瘋說妄講，固似染有神經重病，但細揣測其内在心理，實以﹁官迷﹂已甚。，然又無法致之。，而始一再想入非非。，以冀巧取倖致耳。！</p>
<p>何以言之，該計劃書籌募救國銀行基金辦法，係全國四萬萬人，人一撲滿，日納一銅元，二年爲一期，期繳二元，至十年即可籌足二（？）十萬萬元，而完成救國計劃，救國工作，如此便易與否？姑置不論，唯五次繳欵應共需二十萬萬之撲滿。，一時如何趕造？而且偌在一筆撲滿代價。，如何報銷？所以如此這般的﹁救國計劃﹂掩耳盜鈴之梁氏。，諒亦明知其難收實效。，特以醉翁之意。，乃在乎欲以發明計劃之資格。，當選首先即須成立﹁節約救國委員會﹂之委員。，或﹁節約救國銀行﹂之行長等一類要職也。。</p>
<p>試再覈其計劃所發行二十萬萬元流通劵之用途，一爲﹁剿共﹂﹁禦侮﹂軍費與﹁賑災﹂十之二，爲﹁開發實業﹂十之六。尚餘十之二，計洋四萬萬元，以未說明究作何用。，想係﹁羊毛出在羊身上﹂必爲梁氏預劃爲﹁節約救國委員會。﹂及﹁節約救國銀行﹂兩大機關之經費。，或作購買二十萬萬個撲滿之代價也未定。。果然如此，那麽梁財神的廣大神通，己顯然具有做大官的起碼本領。，從此加勉，實不難由布衣搖身一變。，即成威勢赫赫之達官顯貴矣。！</p>
<p>雖然，﹁掛羊頭賣狗肉﹂者流，假借改造社會之招牌。，以希造就特殊地盤。，假借共赴國難之名義。，而圖獵取自己之祿位。，茫茫禹甸。，豈僅梁財神一人獨被﹁官迷﹂而巳哉。？</p>

<h3 id="c304">氫氧吹管 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 龔維禹</p>
<p>我們在規模較大的冶鐵店中，時常看他們用一樣前部作鐵管狀，後面接連着二條橡皮管；而鐵管會放射出無數火星，火焰的器具，向任何鐵器噴射，不多時鐵器就給牠溶化，或洞穿了；多奇妙啊！這就是我要講的：</p>
<p>氫氧吹管﹁Oxyhydrogenbiowpipe﹂在未講牠以前，須把氫和氧燃燒的作用申述一下；</p>
<p>（一）氫Hydrogen是自燃體，着火即燃，其光熖雖然微弱，但其温度却極强烈，</p>
<p>（二）氧Oxygen是助燃體；雖是星星之火遇着充足的氧便能立刻焚熾；氧在燃燒時倘以多量之氧供給，温度可達二千度以上，</p>
<p>這二種氣體可用極大的壓力把牠分别裝在堅固的圓鐵筒中，供給氫氧吹管的消耗，</p>
<p>現在講到氫氧吹管的本身了，</p>
<p>氫氧吹管是用鋼製的，但噴火的焰口是用耐熱的合金做成；前部作管形，後部是似盒形，而有管連接着通裝氫筒的橡皮管，再有一管便是上接噴火焰口，經過盒形而下接裝氧筒的皮帶，因爲牠上接噴火的焰口原故，所以未噴射出焰口外以前，是不會和氫混合的；丨氫氧先混合而燃燒會爆炸，響鳴等危險！在每個通氫或氧的管上，都有關鈕，啓放自如，</p>
<p>用時只須將關鈕放開，氫和氧本來是受壓迫在筒中的，旣得着了出路，便急速的逃出經過橡皮管分别從焰口噴射出外，着火氫便燃燒，因爲有極多量的氧供給，於是便成極强烈的火焰噴出，温度極高，可以溶化堅牢難溶的一切金屬，用氫氧吹管劃切鋼版，穿洞堅厚的鋼版等，是很迅速的，</p>
<p>但可惜氫氧吹管以及一切附屬品都來自外洋，望我國也能彷做起來以塞杜漏，</p>

<p>我住的一所朝南的房間，旣寛大，又明亮，又適當寄宿舍的交通道上，而和我同房的又是兩位有錢的同學，他們有吃不完的零食箱，又會交際，所以許多同學會離開他們的房間整天的坐在我們的房間裏，除了上課之外。</p>
<p>開學了，我們的房間又變成了會客室，滿地是包外國糖的紙殻與菓皮，印着影戲廣告的報紙和刊着裸體女人的圖畫雜誌也散漫的堆在棹上床上，有時也有學校嚴禁的香烟和煑咖啡的氣味在我們的房間裏廻繞着。</p>
<p>初開學的幾天並没有什麽煩重的功課，於是我們的房間更形熱閙起來，而他們的談話郤大都是千篇一律的。</p>

<p>接着什麽錶啦，筆啦，手套啦，絲襪啦，都由每個人的袋裏，箱子裏，拿了出來，而且都說是來路貨。</p>

<p>— 洪</p>
<p>生在這凡事以經濟爲先决條件的現實社會，貧窮的人，最不能害病，否則，只有坐以待斃的一法。自然并不是肯定的說·不幸病魔一旦光降，性命就有不保，但，終於凶多而吉少。Ｐ近來害病了，雖則他本是個窮措大，害的病，却偏是所謂﹁富貴病﹂丨頸項上高高的患着一個瘤，委實紅腫得厲害，非開刀施手術不爲功；那末這筆豪大的醫費從何支付？於是成了問題中的問題。最後他惟有進這爲慈善事業，體恤平民而設的乂乂乂乂分會醫院去。</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂分會醫院三等病房的一隅：</p>
<p>﹁謝謝，給我換上點稀飯好哪？﹂很柔弱的細聲而顫抖的唤着，請求那個離去病榻不遠的女看護來帮他換着稀飯。﹁······﹂她只刁黠的望他一眼，故意不響。</p>
<p>﹁呃丨請你换上點稀飯，聽得嗎？﹂﹁怎麽啦，你倒要那種稀飯？老是閙的不休！﹂</p>
<p>﹁是呵，我要淸爽點的稀飯：像這盌　雜着灰塵，而且有點羶味，恐怕不合衛生。﹂</p>
<p>﹁奇怪的很，虧你好說。三等病病有這種黄米稀飯，老實說，已經夠寛待的了。嘿，要淸爽？到頭等二等病房中去！那末！﹂</p>
<p>﹁請原諒我們的窮苦病人，通融﹂下好啦！謝謝你，請勿嘰哩咕嚕的多講話了吧！﹂</p>
<p>﹁呸！醫院裏可　你多少錢？何况膳和宿。彰明的白供給你們；如果不願守此地規則的話，馬上可以呌你出院。﹂她威嚇似的說：﹁不久的以前，同樣的有個病人丨被院長驅逐出院去的。你要好好注意點。﹂</p>
<p>﹁看護，看···看護，請來。﹂當Ｐ接受了她一番敎訓之後，她便撒嬌她轉回去了；而Ｐ仍用本有的賊懇態度，希冀最後一線的希望；﹁算了，算了。不過現在腦袋怪沉重的，頭痛啊，哎丨瘤上有濃流着，請你快快醫呀。﹂</p>
<p>﹁豈不笑話哩，看護看護？眞是倒霉煞。﹂</p>
<p>﹁張小姐，恕我恕我，　錯了。﹂可憐Ｐ一面痛着鳴咽，一面陪着她的罪。他迅速憶起同等病房裏Ｋ的話：不能亂嚷看護，稱聲﹁密絲﹂﹁小姐﹂，也許來得妥帖些······。</p>
<p>﹁噎，要你來陪罪討好？我們不是任意喚使的看護，我們竟是護士班派來實習而已，誰高興同你們纏繞着不淸丨﹂</p>
<p>時間像溜烟的快，現在又到了午夜的時分。Ｐ痛得不能入睡，他傷心的又想起爲了﹁稀飯﹂，﹁瘤上流濃﹂，而受着她一番敎話。默默地想；這裏的醫院本是爲慈善事業和憫恤平民而設的，怎麽有此怪現象？雖則她是來實習的，但此時而實習得此種欺弄平民的本領，將來高升成了醫士的地位，唉，不知將要悮盡幾多蒼生呀？在對面窗帘裏帶來了一陣陣戲謔聲，并隠約的看見是她和大胖子黄醫生正摟抱着而作熱烈的Kiss,他便故意拖聲曳氣的呵了個欠：</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>那三年的學徒生活，算是已過去（現在在是第四年了）；但是還没有得到行東發給一點薪金，作爲拿我當職員相待的表示。終日勞力，難道永没有代價嗎？這是多麽夠失望呀！因爲家庭在經濟重重困迫之下，尚賴我一支生力軍去解圍的！</p>
<p>現在想向行東，請求發給薪金；可是狡猾的行東，見我輒有不滿態度，早有露骨的表示：說﹁現在謀事難，雖有人願白替人做事，不受分文的報酬，只求吃一口飯的人，都不要哩！﹂誠然，目下欲覓一噉飯地，是很難，而他就利用這一點，使人在他的壓榨下，不敢呌聲苦。所以平時不許人閱書報，做研究學問的事，也許使人愚昧無知地任他榨取吧！編者先生，長此下去，如何是好呢？論我年紀是不怎樣小了丨</p>
<p>唯一的辦法，只有另再謀事。但是才薄識淺，什麽事能使我愉快勝任？且没大來頭，更没中學大學的資格，眞難得很哩！貴報業餘週刊的﹁自我職業介紹，﹂對於没有顯親貴戚，而想謀事的一般人們，確是一個，救命圈。然而我的程度，照這封信看來，不知能做别的什麽事否？也不知容許像我這種人去登載否？請賢能的編者先生，千萬給我一個指示。你是爲許多人解决困難的，我渴望等你的回音呢！蔡吉東謹上</p>
<p>乂　　　乂　　　乂　　乂</p>
<p>編者按：在這不景氣的年頭，到處都閙着﹁緊縮﹂和﹁失業﹂。祗求吃一只飯，並不希望要報酬的人，的確很多。但是做資本家的，却不該利用這個機會，來壓榨窮人，你們應當充分利用萬能的資本，來發展事業，去容納這許許多多的失業者。我們不敢唱高調，呌你們散財；但是你要知　今天减少一個失業者，就是替社會除去一個危險分子。他們誠然是直接得到了恩惠，但是你也間接可以得到安全。這種利人利己的事情，何樂而不爲呢。要是你目光如豆，只知這眼前的利益，不顧人家的痛苦，一味榨取，弄到一旦破裂，社會大亂，﹁皮之不存，毛將安附﹂呢！</p>
<p>照蔡君的來信（一字未改）看來，文字淸通，思想正確；照你這種人才，要找個事情，尚不十分爲難。說也奇怪，現在各處充滿失業者的時候，意有許多地方，正在閙﹁用不到好人﹂的把戲呢！蔡君您也不必過於憂慮，因爲除了你現在做的那個所在之外，這世界上需要人的地方正多着呢！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>菊分擁在一堆繡被的中間，臉色憔悴得像乏了雨露的鮮花一般，兩條新月似的秀眉，緊緊地蹙着，見了伍逸，很不自然的發了一笑。</p>
<p>﹁這裏···痛得很·····﹂她有生條手指指着自己的喉嚨。</p>
<p>﹁喉痛嗎？厲害不厲害？﹂伍逸差不多巳站在她的床沿邊了。</p>
<p>她徵徵把頭一點。</p>
<p>﹁你没有請醫生嗎？﹂伍逸俯下了半個身子，兩人的臉，相距不到一尺。　　菊芬慢慢地搖着她的左手，却把右手掩住了自己的口腔，似乎怕累伍逸傳染了她的喉症。</p>
<p>﹁我替你打電話去！﹂伍逸旋過身就走，意思是要下樓去打電話，給菊芳請醫生。</p>
<p>﹁不要去！不要去！我怕，······﹂菊芬却死命的反對，因爲她在産後害了一次病，嘗夠了痛苦，一聽人提起醫生，她便害怕起來了。</p>
<p>伍逸知道她的性子很拗執，忙依着她站住了，同時便低下頭，默默地想着。</p>
<p>﹁啊！我給你去買些藥水來吧！﹂立刻，他就想起了專治喉症的特效藥﹁雙氱水﹂和﹁福美明達藥片﹂來，也不再徵求菊芬的同意，便溜一般的奔下樓去了。</p>
<p>乂乂邨一帶因爲是住宅區的緣故，店舗很少，藥房簡直没有，倒有一家出租汽車的車行，伍逸忙雇了一輛汽車，飛也似的趕上南京路去，不像買，像搶一般的買了一瓶藥片和兩瓶藥水，又特地帶了兩塊錢菊芬所愛吃的花旗橘子，依舊搭着原雇的汽車趕回來。</p>
<p>這是一個快到月底日子。平時，伍逸化錢最爽利，她夫人限制他的六十塊錢的另用，到二十四或是二十五，往往就完了，今天他衣袋裏也祇剩整整的八塊錢；車費，藥水，橘子，恰巧如數兩訖。</p>
<p>因爲已經傾囊的緣故，這一晚，伍逸照常在十點半鐘回府的時候，竟不能像往日一般的雇車走了；没法，他祗得安步當車，到家裏，已累了一聲臭汗。　　不料這一個小小的秘密，却給乖巧伶俐的阿金姐瞧透了，她又一字不漏的報告了菊芬。</p>
<p>﹁請把這封信帶去看一遍！﹂第二天，伍逸特地提早了一點鐘趕到王家來，據菊芬說，喉痛巳减了許多，他當然是高興極了。臨走時，菊芬突然打她所靠着的枕頭的下面，抽出了一個淡黄色的信封來授給伍逸，却又不准他立刻拆開來，要他出了門才拆看。</p>
<p>一脚才跨出門，伍逸己來不得的拆開了這個神秘的信封；瞧裏面，却是兩張十元的紙幣，和一頁女人用的粉紙，紙上寫着幾個很療草的鉛筆字：</p>
<p>﹁你不願意我害病，要我吃藥，我怎麽能聽你來來去去跋涉呢？一笑。﹂</p>

<p>— 西容</p>
<p>魯道爾夫范倫鐵諾死後</p>
<p>最爲女性所追求之一人</p>
<p>賴甫脫有一次幾乎被一位瘋狂的女性民强姦。那位色情狂的女性假借了無線電演講員的名義，要和賴甫脫會面。那時賴甫脫已將入睡，所以着了睡衣，出來見他，不意那位女子進室之後，冷不防地將上下身衣服都脫光了，奔向賴甫脫，要求與他苟合。賴甫脫趕緊抓了一只椅子，作爲防身之具。後來他唤進他的書記來，纔將那位女子勸走了。</p>
<p>賴甫脫第一次被困於女性，是在紐奥林斯，當時有一位少女，溜進了賴甫脫戲院的化裝室，一進門看見賴甫脫，就要求與他一脗。亦有人寫信給他，要求與他一面，不然就自殺了。有一次很有趣，有一對姊妹花設法鑽進了賴甫脫的化妝室。那兩位女子，一位大的不過十七八歲，那位小的，還是一個小孩子。不意他們談了幾分鐘的話，那位小的怱然喊着﹁你快抱我在懷裏，你弄傷我好了。﹂賴甫脫說﹁你的姊姊在旁邊。我怎麽敢呢？﹂不意那位姊姊竟說﹁不要緊的，她呌你弄傷他，你就弄傷她好了。﹂賴甫脫知道這一對女性，亦不是好纏的，就設法呌他的書記來解圍。諸如此類的事情，實不勝枚舉。幸虧他那位書記，總不離他的左右。不然的話，賴甫脫就不堪設想了。</p>
<p>賴甫脫說﹁已婚的女子最危險﹂。他說﹁凡已婚的女子，能夠離棄了自己的丈夫，去尋求别的男性，那她是什麽事都做得出來的﹂。有一次有一位婦人，賄賂了旅館的管事，定了靠近賴甫脫旁邊的一個房間。等賴甫脫出去演戲的時候，他偷偷開了他的門掩近了他的房間。等到賴甫脫演完了戲回來，看見一位女子睡在他的床上，他就把她抱了起來，送出門外，自已瑣了門睡覺了。</p>
<p>此外還有許多女子，向他提出奇奇怪怪的要求。有的脫去了衣服請他在背心上簽字；有的請他畫嘴唇；有的要求他脗她的肩胛，然後將他脗的地方，滲成紅色以作終身的紀念。還有一位紐約的富孀，願意送他一所大住宅，祇要他每年同居一個月。那位富孀是社會上極有名的，倘使將她的名字宣佈了，包管能成一條轟動全國的新聞。</p>
<p>戲院裏的器具擺設，因女性侵襲賴甫脫而損毁的，在戲院方面，亦屬一大損失，但院主都引以爲榮，毫無吝惜，並且要求他再來。還有許多營業不振的戲院，要求他蒞臨一次，冲冲喜，生意就好了。</p>
<p>末了，賴甫脫還有三只鑽戒，係女性擲在戲台上的：他要知道她們姓名住址，好將戒指退還。（完）</p>

<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>這的確是一個非常麻煩的問題。當這整個市塲都日形凋敗的時候，憎影部門的生産品如仍須極力挽救它營業上的危機，那末便必須别出途徑，用盡方法去找尋﹁出路﹂。但是還有什麽新奇的法門呢？愛情的把戲已經不大時髦，大腿，肉感也漸漸的令人厭倦了，獸片雖然風行一時，但是差不多也成過去，一切都不大興了。但是在没有辦法的當中總還要想出一個辦法來，這便是將這些比較新的法門兒聚合攏來，成爲一個旣愛情又肉感，而且還有野獸的搏鬥。那末﹁奈格奈﹂便企圖在這樣的用意中來創立一格。</p>
<p>編劇者是在這樣畸形的條件之下爲了要有野獸搏鬥之緊張的畫面，於是戀愛的塲面便不得不减輕許多，而且所謂肉感者也祗好以菲洲土人的黑裸體來允數，再加上一些擁抱，Kisso正因爲各方面都要顧及，結果任何方面都没有顧得周全。</p>
<p>本片的故事便是極牽强的：那醫生若說是爲了人道而冒險入内地爲土人療疾，但是後來却因救愛人出危險而不惜火焚村莊，復縱猛獸以噬村人。伯爵夫人據本事所說爲一蕩婦，可是其後却爲了愛醫生不耐﹁相思之苦﹂而趨就；不僅是畫面上並不曾有如本事上的﹁中途危險迭輕﹂，即就女人本身而論，亦是前後不同性格，究竟不知道這伯爵夫人到底是怎樣的一個女人？根本這個伯爵夫人和那另一醫生史達克者，就没有現身劇中的必要。如其必須要有一個故事，那末這樣離奇牽强不能自圓其說的叙述，眞令人感覺美國片愈益日暮途窮了　　就演出技巧說，那没攝影和配光到是還可以看看的。如開頭的樹葉的圖案美，以及由百葉窗中射入的陽光而在畫面上顯出條紋的陰影，都是很值得學習的。收音也還淸脆。</p>
<p>本片的導演可以說是失敗了的。雖然開頭時對於鏡頭的運用很是聰明。同時當醫生去見伯爵夫人時，先行來一個嬌滴滴的聲音，有如本戲中的﹁倒板﹂，以提高觀衆對於她的注意力。像這樣的着重女角，應當對她加以特别生動的描寫，如說明書中所說的成爲一個蕩婦，然而從此以後便將她放過了。尤其是關於她的情奔，簡直全不描寫，眞使我們莫明其妙。又如女人臨刑時之恐怖的重覆，因爲過於重覆的原故，反而應緊張而不緊張了。</p>
<p>至於演員除飾醫生者比較可以外，其餘均屬平庸。尤其是那女人簡直不能演戲。</p>
<h3 id="c313">評﹁亞州風雲﹂StormOverAsia <a href="#c313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>詩歌似的情調</p>
<p>小說似的描寫</p>
<p>在本文的前面，我覺得關於片名確有略說幾句的必要。雖然本片原名是怎樣寫的恕我不能告訴讀者，但就英文譯名﹁StormOverAsia﹂和日本的譯名﹁亞細亞之嵐﹂看來，我們知道應應眞譯爲﹁亞洲的暴風雨﹂，雖然比較的不大順口，但是决不像﹁亞洲風雲﹂那末含混。其次本片曾經有一次譯爲﹁國魂﹂，現在已經改製過，在後面還加上一面靑天白日的國旗，調如﹁國魂﹂的復活。</p>
<p>誰都知道，這是蘇聯影片中具有世界性的名片，也是名導演普朶數金的代表。當然我們並不因爲如此而加以無謂的頌揚，而應當就其作品的本身從事於嚴密的批判。那末，很自然的不僅是它的意圖是代表了被壓迫民族的呼聲，而且卽在導演技丐上，亦有許多生氣勃勃而非常有力的典型。布朶敷金，能夠將弱小民族的反抗精神，在他的作品中表現出來。</p>
<p>弱小民族的蒙古人，爲了疾病，爲了自己的生存，不得不出賣他們所辛苦得來的獸皮。但是，他們常被操縱於帝國主義的商業壟斷之中，於是一襲銀狐只能得到極微的代價。然這銀狐却是這帶有武器的商人送給司令女公子的頂好的禮物，雖然是從蒙古人那裏掠奪而來的。他們不僅是在商業實行掠奪，而且爲了鎭壓殖民地，必須以武力消滅蒙人的反抗運動，同時對於殖民地的統治著，却又利用他們的迷信而加以籠絡和麻醉。不獨如此，而且企圖利有封建勢力的﹁天子﹂，成爲統治殖民的工具。特别是　於帝國主義者之玩弄傀儡，以及所謂﹁互相尊理雙方利益﹂的狗屁條約，在劇中加以詳盡的解釋。至於他們對於蒙古人的生殺予奪，那簡直等於家常便飯了。但是殖民地的人民終於是反抗的了，這反抗的爆發，畢竟是和暴風雨一樣而將帝國主義消毁無遺的了。我們看罷，這便是被壓迫民族唯一的出路，他們只有在廣大的鬥爭中，將自身解放出來。</p>
<p>因爲導演精微而不煩膩的描寫，全剛的演進，有如一部技巧純熟的小說，在後面描寫直接革命的一部份，又好像是一首熱情奔放而又有力的詩，甚至於在靜的畫面中，我們可聽出萬馬奔騰的悲壯呐喊。</p>
<p>但是因爲導演過於着重於主角的原故，以致將他寫成一個革命的英雄，同時大槪是中國剪裁的關係，在後段比較的突然而不大連貫，而且最後過於象徵。然而並不因此而使本片如何减色。</p>
<p>在本片中我們可以看出導演很是和信戀感（lnscsration），但是同時對於Methode亦是非常認眞。同一導演的代表作默片，還有﹁母﹂和﹁聖比德的臨終﹂，可惜我們一時還不能看到。　　至於本片的表演，也是非常好的。其他方面，均因篇幅關係從略。</p>
<h3 id="c314">評﹁海浪情波﹂ <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>LuxuryLlner</p>
<p>這片的本事很短，就是描寫一段發生於航行大西洋的船上的悲劇。一個醫和的妻子私逃在這船上，那醫生也追踪而到，謀了一個﹁船中義務醫師﹂的職務，他打算挽回妻子的野心。不了不久他妻子和情人又反目了，她用手槍打死了情人以後，她自己也投海自盡。這時醫生已和船中看護婦發生了戀愛，所以他並没感到失戀的痛苦。</p>
<p>片中的穿揷太多了，旁述的事，比本事還要多出兩三倍，所以鬆懈了觀衆的精神，不能集中。有時印象也異常　糊。並且因導演的不小心，而鑄成大錯。</p>
<p>其實劇本方面，不能說不健全，意義也不錯。把﹁一失足而成千古恨﹂描寫得很透澈。表演也很好，每一個演員都能克盡他應盡的職務。在每一尺膠片裏，都可以找到良好的表演。分配很平均的，丨因爲穿揷多丨比較中當然是喬治白林特EeorgeBlent和琪塔裘漢ZitaJoham懷維恩歐絲彭VivjeneOsborne三位最好。</p>
<p>配角大半在穿揷裏面，這一些穿揷，都代表着某一種環境中的普遍現象，的確是很精彩的。</p>
<p>導演的小聰明是有的，很時髦的學了不少幽默的地方。</p>
<p>對白雖不很多，但有些使人厭煩。佈景不錯，處處不脫離船上應有的景物。光線極柔和，有美感。除了表演以外，當推攝影和剪接爲最好。許多平淡的演來，會呌人覺得不平淡。特寫和鏡頭動作，都還可觀。幾幕天水不分的大自然，取景絶。組織上脫節處也不多。　　所以，拿藝術的主觀來看，她當屬於上選，若論述事方面，却過於繁亂了。</p>
<p>這片子同時映的副片三部，都是極好的。在副片裏，還可以聽見希佛萊的一大段歌唱</p>
<p>如果你平常看戀愛片太多了，那末，這片子也許會使你覺得口味一新。</p>

<h3 id="e18">The Internal Stability Problem Amidst Rural Bankruptcy <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the general opinion has been: anti-Japanese resistance and suppression of the communists are equally important. It has also been said that internal stability must precede resistance against external aggression. This has continued until today, nearly a year and a half. But in terms of foreign affairs, after the loss of three provinces, it was followed by Rehe. The atmosphere of invasion has reached Hebei and Chahar, which are also reported to be tense. In terms of domestic affairs, the large army stationed in Jiangxi has repeatedly lost its main generals and cities. Even Xin'gan has fallen and Nanchang is in alarm. The situation is urgent. Can anti-Japanese resistance and suppression of the communists be equally important? Can internal stability precede resistance against external aggression? Today, it cannot but be openly discussed, and cannot but be calmly discussed.</p>
<p>Today's China problem is but a corner of the world problem. The current domestic and foreign difficulties of China are the inevitable result of the development of world capitalism. We have repeatedly said it. Studying China while being ignorant of the general trend of the world, and talking about politics without knowing what economics is, is just empty fantasy and sitting in a well to view the sky. How can there be any hope? "Only when the granary is full will people know etiquette; only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know honor and shame." When people cannot make a living, they will inevitably take risks. The insights of the ancient sages contain great truth. What is the Jiangxi communists' actions? What is their ideology? That is a separate issue. But their emergence cannot but be recognized as being caused by the economic environment, and as an inevitable product of rural bankruptcy. Our country, from the founding of the Republic to 1932, had a trade deficit of 6.9 billion yuan in 21 years. The civil wars of the warlords during more than 20 years resulted in losses estimated at 1 trillion yuan. The Yangtze River flood the year before last also resulted in losses of 200 billion yuan. Dividing these three items of losses among the 400 million people means that each person's burden has reached more than 47 yuan. For the poor Chinese people, being burdened with more than 47 yuan of damage, how can their bankruptcy be doubted?</p>
<p>Of these three, apart from the trade deficit being a direct exploitation of China by imperialism, the civil wars of the warlords also had imperialism as their background. The extremely heavy losses from the flood were also half due to the result of poverty and civil wars, which led to the disrepair of dikes. Therefore, these three represent the direct and indirect exploitation of imperialism. The trade deficit item, although supplemented by remittances from overseas Chinese and foreign investment in China, the exploitation of trade is universal to all the people, while the benefit of remittances from overseas Chinese only reaches a minority of people. Foreign investment in China creates an even deeper layer of exploitation by imperialism. This multiple exploitation has placed the entire countryside in a state of bankruptcy. The global panic has further promoted the Japanese imperialist's intensified aggression against China. There is the completion of the objective conditions for revolution internally, and the fuse for launching a national revolution externally. Therefore, if we still calmly talk about internal stability, how can it be achieved?</p>
<p>What methods are used by those who call for internal stability today? Suppressing the communists, and nothing more. The result of suppressing the communists is that, in the military areas, social property cannot but be further destroyed by the ravages of war. Outside the military areas, building roads and fortifications inevitably takes from the people. The Baojia and Tuanfang, and the supply of provisions to the passing armies, also inevitably take from the people. As a result, the people's strength is depleted day by day. Even rich farmers often flee because the income from land rent is not enough to pay taxes. Under these circumstances, if we want to maintain this to achieve internal stability, it seems to be a major contradiction. The soldiers who are utilized to carry out the suppression work are transformed from these very farmers. It is not easy to expect them to devote their lives to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time of rural bankruptcy, we believe that the work of internal stability can never be achieved by domestic military action. The success of politics lies in utilizing the environment and adapting to the general trend. Now that rural bankruptcy has been achieved as the objective conditions for revolution after a long period of exploitation, there is no other way but to abandon all hope and lead the people in a desperate national revolution against Japanese imperialism. War is valuable when there is a goal. Sacrifice must have meaning. If we can move the army for suppressing the communists to resist Japan, then its meaning will be far greater.</p>

<p>The Justice Minister Resigns and Then Rescinds</p>
<p>The Saito Cabinet is Stretched Thin</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - Justice Minister Koyama Mi resigned this morning, citing as the reason that he should be held responsible for the recent involvement of a key official in the Ministry of Justice in a communist conspiracy case. Public opinion suggests that Koyama's resignation may trigger a cabinet reshuffle, as predicted by various newspapers recently. The resignation of Cabinet Secretary-General Shibata Chika, who was also found to have been involved in the same conspiracy case, is also noted. Newspapers continue to criticize the Saito Cabinet, pointing out various rash actions. Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - It is now known that Justice Minister Koyama's resignation occurred several days ago but was kept strictly secret due to the disturbance of the political situation. Today, it is heard that the Emperor has personally ordered Koyama to withdraw his resignation, stating that he cannot be held responsible for the involvement of his subordinates in the communist conspiracy.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 7th - The issue of Justice Minister Koyama's resignation has been resolved with his retention. The withdrawal of the Justice Minister's resignation seemingly brings the matter to a close, thus preventing the collapse of the cabinet. However, Justice Minister Koyama submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Saito on the 5th, so the Prime Minister, upon entering the Imperial Palace on the 6th, after the ceremony of supplementing the aide-de-camp, immediately presented the Justice Minister's resignation. At that time, he also pleaded that in this time of national crisis, the Justice Minister should be encouraged to serve the country. As a result, Justice Minister Koyama's resignation was returned. Therefore, at 9:30 AM on the 7th, Prime Minister Saito invited Justice Minister Koyama to the Prime Minister's official residence to convey the Emperor's will and request his continued service. Justice Minister Koyama was greatly moved and withdrew his resignation. At 9:50 AM, he entered the Imperial Palace to express his continued service, thus confirming his retention. However, Prime Minister Saito, in presenting the Justice Minister's resignation, pleaded that in this time of national crisis, there was no need for resignation due to positions within the Ministry of Justice, which has caused a stir in political circles and is likely to become a major issue. The reason being, there is no precedent for a Prime Minister to express his own opinion before presenting the resignation of a cabinet member. Moreover, making a unilateral decision to retain the Justice Minister without consulting the cabinet member's opinion raises significant constitutional concerns, leading to a considerable atmosphere of criticism towards the Prime Minister's actions. Therefore, the issue will transform from the Justice Minister's resignation to the Prime Minister's responsibility, and how it unfolds is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 7th - Among the cabinet members, opinions vary regarding the procedure of requesting the resignation and the Prime Minister's plea arising from Justice Minister Koyama's resignation issue. Some believe that Justice Minister Koyama should have consulted the cabinet before requesting his dismissal, hence they are dissatisfied with the Prime Minister's actions. In addition to the issue of Finance Minister Takahashi's possible resignation and others, the cabinet's control is quite disorganized, and in the future, it will diminish its vigor in dealing with the current situation. Therefore, voices are raised that this matter is more serious than the current issue of requesting the resignation. As such, the current cabinet led by Prime Minister Saito may have its total resignation expedited.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 7th - Justice Minister Koyama has accepted the Emperor's edict and rescinded his intention to resign. There are various opinions within the cabinet regarding this matter, and the cabinet meeting today also declined to discuss it. There is no precedent for the Prime Minister to submit an opinion on the resignation issue of a cabinet member, and various parties in the political circles attach great importance to this issue. It is heard that the opinions of each faction are generally as follows: Seiyukai (Friends of Constitutional Government), this issue can be considered an important constitutional matter. The Prime Minister's disregard for means is difficult to understand. The current cabinet has become a lamp in the wind due to this incident, and the day of its downfall is not far off. Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party), the Prime Minister, in view of the gravity of the situation, is determined to overcome all difficulties and implement government affairs, as evidenced by the issue of retaining Justice Minister Koyama. The Prime Minister's submission of opinions may become a problem, but it is not related to the fate of the cabinet. Kokumin Domei (National League), the basis for the Justice Minister's resignation, from the perspective of national morality, should be the responsibility of the Prime Minister. However, the Prime Minister's creation of a so-called opinion letter, begging the Emperor to retain the Justice Minister, is difficult to understand. The current cabinet has no way to resolve this matter other than to implement a total resignation in the near future. House of Peers, the Prime Minister, based on the opinion of elder statesman Prince Saionji, hopes that the current cabinet will assume governmental affairs and handle the extraordinary situation. Therefore, he strives to prevent the shaking of the cabinet. In the future, the attitude of the Seiyukai will dominate the political situation. It seems that the current cabinet cannot maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>Shao Yuan Chong Reports on the Inspection of North China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Committee hosted reporters at 3 PM on the 7th, with over forty people in attendance. Shao Yuan Chong reported on his impressions of inspecting North China for a month and the precautions to be taken in the future as follows: The Japanese army sees the occupation of Rehe as an easy way to advance and plans to cross the Great Wall. Thanks to the sacrifice of Shang Zhen, Guan Linzheng, and Song Zheyuan, the enemy has been blocked. Although our weapons are inferior to the enemy's, our spirit is superior. Skillful use of night raids often achieves superficial success. Although there are many wounded soldiers' hospitals along the way, the wounded suffer greatly due to inadequate facilities. The people on the front lines and the army are extremely harmonious, secretly communicating information and providing supplies. From this, it can be seen that the nation's spirit has been revitalized, which is superior to any weapon. Although the enemy army has been using new weapons as a cover in recent years, the combat effectiveness of the soldiers is quite weak. Our army, with the excitement of national spirit, inflicts heavy damage on the enemy whenever short-range engagements occur. If we add new weapons, the enemy is truly not to be feared. The enemy, having suffered setbacks at various passes of the Great Wall, does not dare to lightly attempt to invade Peiping and Tianjin. Therefore, Peiping and Tianjin remain as peaceful as ever. However, the enemy's ambitions have not been suppressed. Recently, they have been attacking in eastern Luan and looking west at Chahar, causing tension in Zhangjiakou and Duolun. They are also deliberately spreading rumors to alienate the government from the people. The generals and soldiers on the front lines are well aware of their deception, so their determination to resist is further strengthened. In this crisis, the people of the whole country should be responsible. Soldiers have a natural duty to defend the country and should be inspired by their conscience to do so. The Japanese aim is to occupy Asia and invade the world. Our only option is to seek survival in death. The Japanese are also colluding with the Communist Party to bring disaster to the Yangtze River. Although the Central Government has repeatedly advised the Red Bandits to surrender, few have become aware of the situation. Therefore, Chiang, when he had no other choice, went to supervise the suppression in order to achieve the effect of securing the interior and resisting foreign aggression. In short, in this time of internal and external troubles, we only ask that the whole country, from top to bottom, do its best to work together. In order to concentrate its party and national strength, the Central Government has proposed to convene a National Assembly in October of this year. According to the Outline of National Reconstruction, it may not be entirely in compliance, but in this extraordinary period, it should be what the people of the country eagerly desire to do. To compete for survival is an inevitable trend. The environment of competition has not stopped, and the struggle for life has not ceased. We hope that our colleagues in the press will awaken the people of the whole country to compete and struggle for survival together, provide a way out of the bewildered crossroads, and indicate the path, which is indeed necessary.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a Central Committee member, the agenda of the Provisional Plenary Delegate Conference will not be notified separately. This is because the convocation of the Provisional Plenary Delegate Conference is purely to resolve the issue of whether or not to advance the convocation of the National Assembly. Therefore, this issue is the key case of the Plenary Delegate Conference. Thus, when the Central Standing Committee met the other day, it was agreed that since the reason for convening the Provisional Plenary Delegate Conference had been stated in the notification, there was no need to notify the agenda separately. As for the draft principles of the representative election law and the organizational law of the Provisional Plenary Delegate Conference, they have been decided upon by the Standing Committee and the various director committees. Generally, they will be handed over to the Central Organizational Committee to quickly draft a plan and submit it to the Central Standing Committee for a decision.

<p>(Nanjing) Before the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, traffic between Kulun and Inner Mongolia was blockaded by the Outer Mongolian government. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations, the 20,000 overseas Chinese residing in Kulun have gradually regained their freedom to operate businesses due to changes in the policies of the local government. They have also returned to the interior to transport local and domestic goods for sale, and transport furs and other goods from Outer Mongolia back to the interior for sale. The Outer Mongolian government also issues return passports and does not restrict the carrying of silver dollars or goods. In the past three or four months, there has been a major turning point in trade between Zhangjiakou and Kulun. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

It is now learned that the method will be changed. The party headquarters in the three provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, and Ningxia will accommodate as many Mongolians as possible as committee members or to participate in their work. As for military affairs, the Military Affairs Commission believes that the lower-ranking officers of the national defense forces in the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Xinjing, and Ningxia lack formal training. It has decided to establish a Mongolian branch of the Central Military Academy to train lower-ranking cadres and military talents in the vicinity. Gui Yongqing has been appointed to make preparations. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>MacDonald Formally Accepts Roosevelt's Invitation</p>
<p>France, Italy, and Germany Will Also Send Representatives to the Conference</p>
<p>Comprehensive Discussion of World Economic War Debts and Disarmament</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Washington, 6th) The US President has issued a formal invitation today, inviting British Prime Minister MacDonald to visit the United States. If French Premier Daladier can indicate that he has time to visit the United States, a similar invitation will be issued immediately. It is now believed that if French Premier Daladier is unable to come to the United States in person due to circumstances, he may send Foreign Minister Peng Gu or former Premier Herriot as representatives.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 7th) News from Paris states that the French government will send representatives to the United States to participate in the talks between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister MacDonald regarding war debts and economic issues.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 6th) It is reported that in addition to inviting British Prime Minister MacDonald to the United States for discussions, President Roosevelt is also willing to receive representatives from other countries to discuss ways to restore world trade. It is now expected in official circles that France, Italy, and Germany will send personnel to the United States, and there is also talk of inviting Canadian Prime Minister Bennett to visit the United States. The US President intends to contact the representatives of various countries separately, rather than holding a round table conference.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Washington, 6th) After the invitation to MacDonald was officially delivered to British Ambassador Lindsay today, it was further learned that Secretary of State Hull had informally notified France that the US government welcomes Daladier or a representative to come to the US to discuss disarmament and economic issues. It is said that war debts were not mentioned in this informal proposal, but it is expected here that after French and British leaders meet face-to-face, the French war debt issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the US President and Secretary of State plan to discuss a wide range of issues with British and French representatives, but the most important is the economic issue, as they want to remove obstacles and open up a smooth path so that the world economic conference can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>If both the British and French prime ministers can accept the invitation, it is expected that MacDonald and the French representative will depart for the United States within the next week and engage in consultations during the Easter holiday.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Washington, 6th) Today, the sending of the invitation by the United States and the formal acceptance by British Prime Minister MacDonald were only a few hours apart, both being handled by British Ambassador Lindsay. It is reported that MacDonald will travel to and from the United States on the Berengaria liner, and during his stay in the United States, he will reside as a guest of the White House. MacDonald's reply included words of gratitude for the invitation and stated that his colleagues all advised him to accept the invitation.</p>
<p>Tonight, official circles acknowledge that the issues to be discussed by MacDonald and US leaders will be unrestricted. It is reported that Roosevelt, Hull, and Lindsay have already formulated a trial procedure. At any time, any important issue can be raised, but the talks will focus on world economy, war debts, and disarmament, and the results are expected to clear the obstacles to convening an economic conference.</p>
<p>Several prominent editors have suggested that after the meeting between the US President and the British Prime Minister, they should jointly issue a letter to the American people, informing them of the progress. It is recalled that when MacDonald visited the United States last time, his speech over the radio won the sympathy of the American public, and today, no one is expected to be better than MacDonald at explaining to the Americans the situation that Britain and Europe are forced to deal with.</p>
<p>As for whether French Premier Daladier will come in person or send someone else as a representative, it is expected that there will be an informal indication tonight.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 6th) It is now learned that the British Prime Minister will go to the United States on April 15th and stay in Washington for about three or four days. It is also reported that the organizing committee of the World Economic Conference will meet in London on April 22nd, at which time the date of the World Economic Conference will be decided.</p>
<p>(Havas, Paris, 7th) As of yesterday, the French government has not yet received a formal invitation from the US government to send a representative to Washington in the near future to participate in talks to discuss preparations for the World Economic Conference. The French government will decide on the candidate for representative as soon as it receives the formal invitation. Premier Daladier will probably not be able to go to Washington in person, and Foreign Minister Peng Gu also needs to stay in Europe for work in Geneva and cannot go to the United States. Therefore, someone may be selected from outside the cabinet. The most promising candidates are the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, former Premier Herriot, or the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, Béranger.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 6th) While inviting British Prime Minister MacDonald to visit Washington during the Easter holiday, the United States is also quickly proceeding with its international and economic policies. It is now reported that the proposal to authorize President Roosevelt to conclude reciprocal tariff treaties within a specified scope and to allow President Roosevelt to freely handle the affairs of the World Economic Conference with other governments has been largely drafted.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 7th) It is now rumored from Congress that President Roosevelt's plan for reciprocal trade agreements will be based on reducing import tariffs by ten percent. (Havas, New York, 6th) According to confidential information reprinted by the New York Times, President Roosevelt has decided not to ask Congress for the power to abolish war debts, but to ask Congress to allow him to announce short-term war debt payment deferrals and to allow him to negotiate with foreign countries to reduce war debts in exchange for some benefits.</p>

<p>French Premier Announces Foreign Policy in the Chamber of Deputies</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Peng Gu's Draft Note Sent Out Today</p>
<p>(Havas, Paris, 7th) Regarding the four-power pact proposed by Britain and Italy, a memorandum has been drafted by Foreign Minister Peng Gu and the head of the foreign affairs department. The text is very short, first explaining the principles, followed by specific recommendations, all based on Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant regarding administrative integrity and political independence, Article 16 regarding sanctions against aggression, and Article 19 regarding the procedure for revising treaties. This memorandum, in addition to political clauses, clarifies the benefits of economic cooperation among the four powers. In other words, it reiterates the French theory of European integration. The full text will be sent to London and Rome tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 6th) Today, a semi-official report stated that the four-power agreement proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has lost its original appearance after being revised by France, and therefore can no longer be accepted by Germany.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 6th) French Premier Daladier delivered a long-awaited foreign policy speech in the Chamber of Deputies today, expressing France's concern about the situation in Germany and asking a question: "In view of a revitalized nationalism, should Europe redraw the map to seek peace?" Daladier continued that France intends to pursue a construction policy and opposes the supervisory power of major countries, which is even more ambitious than the Holy Alliance. Any agreement must logically be based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Locarno Pact, and the entire League of Nations Covenant, and not based on a part of the Covenant, so that this revision will not lead to envy among the countries. France will propose practical amendments to the British disarmament plan, but France very much hopes that Britain's faithful efforts will be completely successful. In his speech, Daladier praised Britain and Italy, and then mentioned the economic sphere, saying that he was willing to gladly acknowledge the goodwill expressed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini towards France. After the speech, the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the government by a vote of 430 to 107.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 6th) French Foreign Minister Peng Gu said in a speech before the vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies today that Germany's merger of political and police organs into one is a violation of the peace treaty. France is now consulting with the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact and Germany, and if necessary, will propose this matter in Geneva. He then said that the Disarmament Conference is now encountering opposition from the Italian-German group, and if this group continues, it will cause tomorrow's war in Europe. Peng Gu also praised Britain's loyalty and finally said that Italy's proposal should be considered so that the four powers can cooperate on related issues.</p>
<p>(Havas, Warsaw, 7th) A reporter from the "Polish Post" interviewed Czech Foreign Minister Benes and asked him to express his opinion on the Four-Power Pact. Benes declared, "If the establishment of the Four-Power Club is followed by a majority club, as some people expect, then the world will fall into complete chaos. If the four powers can conclude a treaty, why can't Poland and the Little Entente conclude a treaty with each other? If the major powers want to interfere in our affairs, why can't we interfere in the affairs of the major powers? And Russia can also unite with China to create a two-country club and focus their eyes on British India. The intention of the Four-Power Pact is to hope for peace, but the result is the opposite. Once the Four-Power Pact is concluded, if any events related to us are discussed by the four powers, we should answer, 'Why not go to Geneva?' We dare to believe that if the Little Entente countries and Poland declare that they will withdraw from the League of Nations after the Four-Power Pact is concluded, then the Four-Power Pact will not be established. In short, if the Four-Power Pact is concluded, the League of Nations will be destroyed as a rubble field."</p>
<p>(Havas, London, 7th) Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu is very active here. This morning, he visited the Polish Ambassador and the Greek Minister. At noon, he will have lunch with former Finance Minister Chamberlain. After lunch, he will go to the Foreign Office and meet with Sir Lawrence at the Treasury. In the evening, he will have dinner with the ministers of the Little Entente countries stationed in London and will leave London tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e66">United States Reorganizes Navy <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Allocates $46 Million to Build Ships</p>
<p>Strives to Reduce Naval Administrative Expenses</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Washington, 6th) Although the United States still supports the reduction of armaments, and its leaders will soon meet with British and French authorities to discuss this matter, the situation in Congress today clearly indicates a firm trend towards building new ships. Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, met with Navy Secretary Swanson today to discuss the ship construction program. It is reported that Swanson generally agreed with the plan to allocate $46 million for the next year, saying that he would be very pleased if Congress could pass this ship construction budget. In addition to Swanson and Vincent discussing the ship construction program, Senator Trammell also introduced a bill today stipulating the construction of new ships to reach treaty limits. It has now been transferred to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee for review. However, naval administrative expenses are being reduced as much as possible. The measures to save funds ordered by the former and current presidents were implemented today by order of the Navy Department. In the future, each naval shipyard will work five and a half days a week, affecting a total of 44,000 people. All officers in charge of construction and repair and all soldiers and non-military employees must comply. However, this order is not enough to reduce naval effectiveness, and in practice can maintain the existing staff, otherwise there will inevitably be reductions.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Washington, 6th) Senator Trammell today introduced a new ship construction bill, specifically stipulating that at least $46 million should be allocated in 1929 to begin construction of five of the fifteen cruisers authorized to be built in 1929, all of which are 10,000-ton cruisers equipped with 6-inch guns, and that two aircraft carriers should be built to replace the old ships, and one 10,000-ton cruiser equipped with an aviation deck to replace the...</p>
<p>...the old ship Rochester, which is about to be dismantled. According to the cruisers passed in 1929, all of them are equipped with 8-inch guns, but after being canceled by the London Treaty, they will now be equipped with 6-inch guns. This ship construction plan will actually complete the warships permitted by the London Treaty. Trammell's case is nothing more than a response to the warning issued by Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, yesterday morning that if new ships are not built immediately, the US naval force will be reduced to fifth place within three years. Vincent is the chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee and a close friend of the US President, and what he says can usually be regarded as having the President's consent. It is also noted that the House has previously passed a bill stipulating the construction of nine cruisers, three submarines, and three destroyers to replace the old ships. Several of these cruisers were passed in 1929, but if Trammell's new proposal can be passed in the Senate, it will be transferred to the House to replace the previous bill.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Beer Prohibition Lifted, All Kinds of Scenes <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>A Spectacle Not Seen in the United States for Many Years</p>
<p>(National News Agency, New York, 7th) At 0:01 this morning (i.e., 12:01 AM), a black hearse, followed by six black-robed pallbearers with solemn demeanor, proceeded from Metley to Broadway. Inside the hearse was a barrel of "near beer," the only drink that those with a craving for yeast had been able to obtain after the prohibition. On this day of lifting the prohibition, it was especially sent to its final resting place. When the hearse arrived in the city center, the pallbearers dumped the "near beer" into the ditch. Then, the accompanying band played a marching song to welcome the return of beer to the United States. At this time, all the hotels, nightclubs, restaurants, and clubs were full. Although the New York Brewers Association decided to start delivering goods only at 7:00 this morning, these drinkers all had a glass in hand, celebrating the lifting of the ban. A huge supply of beer manufactured in the Midwest of the United States was transported to New York by plane and express train. Although there was wild rejoicing everywhere, the order was still good. Today, only nineteen states have issued state laws and police regulations allowing the sale of beer. However, breweries in these nineteen states began delivering beer as soon as the bell rang "thirteen" yesterday, such as in Milwaukee, St. Louis, Chicago, and St. Paul. At first, they used horse-drawn carts to deliver beer, and then they used motor vehicles. When these teams of black horses passed through the thoroughfare, it was not only a spectacle not seen in the United States for many years, but it also made people wonder how so many horses could be found.</p>
<h3 id="e68">US-Russia Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Stalled <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(National News Agency, Washington, 6th) In the past two weeks, there has been no indication from the White House regarding the proposal to resume diplomatic relations with Russia. It is now expected that the US President will probably not make any decision on this issue until the Soviet Union has completed the case of the British engineers being arrested. Although this case is not related to the United States, if the United States decides whether to recognize Soviet Russia or continue to reject it, it may indirectly affect British-Russian negotiations.</p>

<p>Results of Huang Shao-hong's Visit to Feng</p>
<p>Expeditiously Transfer All National Troops to Concentrate on Resisting Japan</p>
<p>Hopes Chiang Will Personally Lead the Army to Unify Authority</p>
<p>Especially Hopes for Practical Implementation and Execution</p>
<p>(Ping News) Minister of the Interior Huang Shao-hong, under the order of Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, went to Zhangjiakou to visit Feng Yuxiang, inviting Feng to go to Beijing to discuss the major plan of resisting Japan. After Huang returned to Ping, he took the Pingpu train to Beijing at 5:15 p.m. on the 4th to report everything to Chiang. It is reported that Feng personally wrote a letter to Chiang on the major plan of resisting Japan, putting forward concrete measures to urge Chiang to implement them. The letter was handed over by Huang to be presented. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"Elder Brother Jieshi,</p>
<p>I received your reply through Comrade Xiwen, who returned from Baoding, and I have read your letter from Jikuan Zhemin, who came to a stop. Your diligence for the country is admirable. I, Xiang, foolishly believe that desperately resisting the Japanese bandits and using all our strength to recover the lost territories as soon as possible is the only important thing today. Even for your personal sake, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of the nation, there is no second path to take. However, the method of resistance should not be to resist only when they attack. If they do not attack, we will just sit and wait for them to attack. Currently, my humble opinion on the method of resistance is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Quickly find a way to transfer 80% of the troops to the front, dividing them into concentrated areas.</p>
<p>(2) Allocate 80% of the military expenditure for the purpose of resisting Japan.</p>
<p>(3) You, Elder Brother, should personally take command to unify authority. If you cannot go, please have Mr. Li Ren-chao take command. This person has bloodiness and conscience and is a true and sincere patriotic hero. Moreover, he has been your Chief of Staff for many years.</p>
<p>(4) Comrades Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, and Dai Ji are brave and good at fighting and full of sacrifice. Cai can lead 50,000 people, Jiang can lead 50,000 people, and Dai can lead 30,000 people, all under the command of Comrade Chen Mingshu, or under your command, as they have experience in resisting Japan.</p>
<p>(5) Song Zheyuan can fight desperately, and Sun Dianying is not afraid of death. Each can lead 50,000 people. If their subordinates are insufficient, allocate them.</p>
<p>(6) Comrade Zhang Fakui is wholeheartedly for the country and has worked hard for the revolution. You, Elder Brother, have known him deeply for a long time. For the sake of national survival, please truly put the past aside and allocate 40,000 troops to his command. He will definitely have a great effect on recovering the lost territories.</p>
<p>(7) Hu Yukun is a hero of the Northeast and a gentleman of integrity. If 50,000 troops can be allocated to his command, he will definitely serve his hometown.</p>
<p>(8) Mr. Jiang Baili and Mr. Huang Yingbai not only have profound military knowledge but also have far-sighted views on national planning. If you ask them to participate in the calculations for resisting Japan, they will definitely offer great strategies.</p>
<p>(9) Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Zhu Ziqiao, Sa Zhenbing, Wang Tieshan, Huang Renzhi, and Zhang Zhongren are all full of love for the country and the people and are great figures of integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness. If you find a way to invite them together and ask them to point out the ways to save the country and the people, they will definitely have righteous methods to relieve the suffering of the people. (10) Grant amnesty to political prisoners and immediately implement freedom of speech, assembly, and association to allow grievances to be expressed and unequal grievances to be voiced. (11) Comrades Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, Yu Youren, Ju Juesheng, Sun Zhesheng, and Li Xiehe each have a kind of hard bone and a kind of chivalrous spirit. Not only is their knowledge high and far-reaching, but their love for the country and the people is even richer. Please take two hours each day to have long and detailed discussions with them. They will definitely be of great help to national affairs. However, do not waste time and speak official language. (12) The country's affairs have become so bad. Of course, many friends cannot escape their blame, but you and I cannot but bear some responsibility. Today's disapproval of evil and even more recognition of sins and admitting mistakes to compatriots across the country are not the actions of a bright gentleman. Especially hope that you, Elder Brother, will advocate it. The above twelve articles are the heartfelt words I, Xiang, have offered to you. Because of your sincere inquiries, Elder Brother, I, Xiang, have learned something and dare not fail to contribute my humble opinions. Practice, work, act, and implement are the basis of all success. There have been not a few declarations in the past, and there are not a few regulations, but there is nothing that does not lack implementation. Especially hope that you, Elder Brother, will pay attention to this three times. I, Xiang, am terrified of the country's demise and offer these words sincerely. I ask Comrades Huang and Xiong to express the rest in person. The South is in sight, and I cannot bear to be parted. Please take care of the country and yourself.</p>
<p>Your Younger Brother, Feng Yuxiang, Bowed and Signed. 22, 3, 30."</p>

<p>Arrives in Xun by Ship and Then Takes a Special Train to Nanchang</p>
<p>Orders the Transfer of Large Armies to Quickly Eliminate the Bandits</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) Chairman Chiang took the Chu You warship west from Beijing at noon on the 4th and arrived in Xun at 6:30 p.m. on the 5th. Xiong Shihui had received the news in advance, so he went from the province to Xun on the morning of the 5th to welcome him. When the Chu You warship was anchored in Xun, Xiong boarded the ship to meet with Chiang, reporting on the situation of the Red bandits' rampant activity after Chiang went north, the suppression of the Red Army, the recent incursion of Zhu and Mao into Xingan Qingjiang, the situation of the suppression, and the general situation of the province's post-disaster reconstruction. Chiang then accompanied Xiong ashore, took a car to the train station, and transferred to a special train on the Nanxun Railway to the province. At about 1:00 a.m. late at night, the special train arrived at Niuxing Station. Those who welcomed him at the station included He Guoguang, Chief of Staff of the Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Lai Yingwei, Commander of the City Defense, Dai Yue, Brigade Commander of the Independent 36th Brigade, and dozens of senior officials from various agencies. After Chiang got off the train and exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel, he took a ferry across the river under strict guard and then took a car directly to the Science Museum to stay. It is reported that Chiang's arrival, in addition to commanding the Central Route Chen Cheng, the Left Route Cai Tingkai, and the Right Route Yu Hanmou's troops to converge in Ruijin in the shortest possible time to eliminate Zhu, Mao, and Peng, also ordered the transfer of troops from Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei to advance to the borders of Jiangxi at the same time to annihilate Fang, Shao, Kong Hechong, and Li Tianzhu's forces. With a force of more than 300,000, the Jiangxi bandits can be wiped out in one fell swoop. Two days ago, Zhu and Mao's pseudo-First Front Army penetrated deeply into Xingan from Le'an, attempting to spy on the provincial capital from Qingjiang, causing great panic among the people. Now that Chiang has arrived in Jiangxi to sit down, the hearts of the people are greatly reassured. After receiving the news of Chiang's arrival in Jiangxi, the morale of the troops on the front line has also been greatly boosted. Chen Cheng has ordered his troops to obliquely cross □□ and flank the bandits in Xingan. Sun Lianzhong's troops are advancing south from Zhangshu, and certain two troops from Yuanhe and Jihe are also advancing towards Xingan, taking a four-sided encirclement approach to eliminate the bandits of Zhu and Mao's pseudo-131st Army Corps between Xingan and Yongfeng.

<p>Secretary and Bureau Chief Kneel as Punishment</p>
<p>New Drama of Han Fuju's Inspection Tour</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuju, accompanied by Zhang Liansheng, Yao Yijie, Sha Yuebo, and others, departed from Jinan at noon on the 4th to inspect eastern Shandong and review county administration. They arrived at Zaoyuan Station at 3:30 PM and entered the city by car at 4:00 PM. At 6:00 PM, he convened a roll call of all government agencies, where the county government secretary and Public Security Bureau Chief Ma Dianbang were ordered to kneel as punishment. The Public Security Bureau Chief was also fined 50 yuan per month. That evening, they stayed at the Yan Gongdian Inn. At 5:00 AM the next morning, he convened a motivational meeting for all government personnel at the county government office. At 6:00 AM, he inspected the detention center. There was a case in which the county magistrate, Feng Yonghe, and the court had mishandled the trial, resulting in a wrongful imprisonment. Han was extremely enraged and ordered the county magistrate, the judge, and the prosecutor to be confined in wooden cages, intending to severely punish them. After local figures pleaded for leniency, they were released. The county magistrate immediately requested a disciplinary action and was given a demerit. The County Public Security Bureau originally had a first-class establishment with four branch offices. After Han inspected the bureau, he ordered it to be changed to a third-class county establishment, completely abolishing the four branch offices. He also instructed the county magistrate to work with the Third Section to handle the matter. Around 10:00 AM, Han heard cases in the county government hall, totaling twelve. After the hearings, he made a brief statement, saying that lawsuits are not for the poor because the law does not protect them. He then gathered the public for an open-air speech. At 11:00 AM, he left the county government office by car to Zaoyuan Station and departed eastward to Qingcheng for inspection (5th).</p>
<h3 id="e72">Three Companies Sign Submarine Cable Contract <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Canceling Submarine Cable Landing Patent Rights</p>
<p>Recovering the Right to Directly Send and Receive Telegrams</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The Ministry of Transportation has been urging the signing of the submarine cable contract with Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies, which had been approved by the National Government. Negotiations have been ongoing for years. The companies finally sent representatives to the Ministry of Transportation on the 5th to apply for submarine cable landing licenses and officially signed the contract with the Ministry's Directorate General of Telecommunications. The entire process and content of the contract are detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Process of Revising the Contract <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies have been operating international telecommunications businesses in China for more than sixty years. All previous contracts contained many provisions that compromised Chinese sovereignty, especially the companies' establishment of receiving and transmitting offices in Shanghai, which granted them the right to directly send and receive telegrams. In December of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the Ministry of Transportation, aware that all these contracts would expire at the end of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), stipulated that one year's advance notice of termination be given. The Ministry promptly notified the companies that all previous contracts would be terminated on January 1, 1931, and informed the Ministries of Foreign Affairs to notify the British and Danish envoys in China. At the same time, the Ministry formally invited the companies to send representatives to the Ministry to discuss the closing matters and future communication arrangements. It was not until the end of March of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) that the companies sent representatives to negotiate. Initially, they demanded permanent submarine cable landing patent rights and insisted that the revised contract should be based on the old contracts. Subsequently, they refused to relinquish the right to receive and transmit telegrams and refused to increase the share of telegraph fees. In all respects, they wanted to maintain their original status. The Ministry of Transportation argued on principle. After nine months, as the contract expired at the end of December of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the companies finally relented. The Ministry then drafted a tentative contract for resolution in accordance with the principles decided by the State Council. From January of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), separate meetings were held. After four months of discussions, an agreement was reached, and the Ministry submitted the draft to the Executive Yuan, which then submitted it to the National Government for review. The companies then sought instructions from their headquarters in order to sign the contract. In December of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the contract was approved by the National Government and ordered to be signed. However, the companies took advantage of the outbreak of the Eastern Provinces Incident (Mukden Incident) and the tense diplomatic situation to delay signing the contract. The Ministry of Transportation was unable to proceed, and another year was lost.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Circumstances of Urging the Contract Signing <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Zhu Jia-hua succeeded as Minister of Transportation. Regarding this revised contract, he deeply felt that, while the gains may not be as satisfactory as desired, the case had been decided by the National Government. The companies, taking advantage of the delay, continued to maintain the status quo and acted independently without being subject to the Ministry's control during this period when there was no contractual constraint. If a resolution was not reached quickly, it would become a de facto recognition, causing even greater damage to national sovereignty. During the Shanghai Incident, the companies refused to allow inspections of telegram transmissions and arbitrarily laid temporary cables in the Huangpu River, as clear evidence of their actions. Consequently, the Directorate General of Telecommunications was instructed to urgently negotiate with the companies and urge them to sign the contract and apply for submarine cable landing licenses. Unexpectedly, the companies continued to create obstacles and delay the process. Following repeated urging from the Ministry, they proposed modifications: (1) The contract should be primarily in English; (2) Price reductions in telegram fees should not require our consent; (3) Route identification and direct routing of telegrams should be explicitly included in the contract; (4) The companies' right to receive and transmit telegrams should be maintained. The Ministry rejected the modifications, stating that the matter had already been decided. The companies then used the pretext of seeking instructions from their headquarters to further delay the process. Having no choice, the Ministry, on January 18, again refuted in detail the four points of modification requested by the companies and set a deadline of February 15 of this year for the contract to be signed in its original form, without any modifications, and for the licenses to be obtained. Otherwise, appropriate and effective measures would be taken, and the companies would bear the responsibility. The companies did not send representatives to the Directorate General of Telecommunications until February 14. On February 15, they met with Minister Zhu, reiterated the previous four demands, and insisted on equal treatment. They stated that they needed to seek further instructions from their respective governments before responding. To achieve a satisfactory outcome, the Ministry granted a discretionary extension. Subsequently, the British envoy negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which in turn sent a letter to the Ministry, requesting a slight extension. Next, the Danish envoy, the British chargé d'affaires, and the American consul also inquired with the Ministry and requested flexible handling, temporarily permitting the companies to retain their receiving and transmitting offices. After several explanations, the envoys and consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Denmark expressed satisfaction. Consequently, the companies abandoned their demands and, in accordance with the original text, sent representatives to the Ministry of Transportation on (April 5) to apply for licenses and formally sign the contract with the Directorate General of Telecommunications.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Key Points of the Contract <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The contract content was signed in accordance with the original proposal approved by the National Government. Key points are as follows: (1) Cancel the patent right for submarine cable landing. According to the old contracts signed by our country with Great Eastern and Great Northern companies during the Guangxu period, without the consent of both parties, no other party was allowed to set up a line to land or communicate in other ways within our country during the contract period. This clause has now been abolished. (2) Stipulate the time limit for submarine cable landing and regulations. The term of the previous contract of Great Eastern and Great Northern companies was 20 years, and the term of the Pacific company was 25 years. The current contract is set for 14 years, and they must apply for a license in accordance with the Commercial Submarine Cable Landing Regulations promulgated by the Ministry, and abide by all the conditions in the regulations. (3) Recover the right to directly send and receive telegrams. The current contract stipulates that the Shanghai telegraph receiving and sending offices of the companies shall be taken over and operated by the Ministry of Transportation, and they shall no longer have the right to directly send and receive telegrams. (4) Revise the line fee to be obtained by our side. For water-line telegrams passing through our country, in the past, European telegrams were divided by an average of 38.5 centimes per word, and American telegrams were divided by an average of 47 centimes per word. The current contract specifies that ordinary telegrams from Shanghai to Europe are 35 centimes per word, and from other places in China to Europe are 60 centimes per word. Telegrams from Shanghai to the Americas are 45 centimes per word, and telegrams from other places in China to the Americas are 70 centimes per word. Our country did not have any line fee for telegrams to and from Shanghai with Japan, the Philippines, the South Seas, and Hong Kong. The current contract specifies 20 centimes per word for Japan and the Philippines, 25 centimes per word for the South Seas, 4 minutes for Hong Kong Huaming, Huami and 8 minutes for foreign language. (5) Recover the underground cable and overhead lines. The underground cable and overhead lines used by the company from the submarine cable landing to its operating room were managed by the company itself. Even our country's own underground cable had to be opened by Great Northern Company. The current contract stipulates that, except for the underground cables required by the company to be borrowed during the contract period, all other cables will be taken back. (6) Recover the borrowing line from Tianjin-Gu. In the past, the land line from Tianjin to Gu was borrowed by the company for its exclusive use, and no rent was charged. The maintenance of the line had to be borne by our country. It has now been completely recovered for our own use. The Great Northern and Great Eastern newspaper rooms in Tianjin and Beijing have also been recovered by our country. (7) Cancel the Fuzhou Great Eastern Company and the Xiamen Great Northern Company. The Shanghai-Hong Kong water line of the company used to land at Fuzhou and Gulangyu respectively to set up bureaus to send and receive telegrams, which were parallel to our land line. This time it was also taken back.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Official Signing Situation <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The two parties first sent specialists to proofread the contract and all vouchers with each other in advance, and worked hard day and night. The entire proofreading was completed on the morning of the 5th. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, the official signing was held. Yan Renguang, Director of the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Transportation, was the signatory of the contract, and Guo Shiheng, the chief of the Section, was the witness. Great Eastern sent Ding Fuerden, Great Northern Peng Sheng, and Pacific Kailai, and the British, Danish and American consuls certified. At the time, they all gathered in the meeting hall of the Ministry. First, Yan Renguang, Chairman of the Ministry of Transportation, delivered a speech, followed by Peng Xing, manager of Great Northern, who answered on behalf of the three companies. Then, the contract and all vouchers were signed and sealed with each other. It was not completed until 6:00 PM.</p>

(2) Request the authorities to issue an order to all customs to exempt all wooden looms and silk satin from export and transit taxes, in order to facilitate activity. (3) Request to inform the National Goods Bank to reduce its interest rates and provide maximum mortgage loans. (4) Request the government to adopt silk industry measures, to verify and exempt interest loans, so as to provide remedy, and other words, the County Chamber of Commerce immediately submitted it to the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Economy and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, asking for relief.</p>

<p>Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, I am deeply afraid that countries will use the League of Nations covenant to impose economic sanctions, and the domestic economy is extremely panic. Therefore, Japanese silk has plummeted in price in European and American markets, and is being dumped in order to absorb cash. As a result, no one asks about Chinese silk. It has completely stopped in the United States. Even in the market, calculated according to Japanese silk, each tan (unit of weight) is only more than 460 taels. Although there is some trading in France, the price is also less than 600 taels. As for the users of silk, the domestic silk factories, firstly, are wary because of the sharp drop in the foreign silk market, and secondly, because of the extremely tight silver, the silk sales are stagnant, so they all take a wait-and-see attitude. The price is only slightly more than 100 taels, and there are very few transactions. A few days ago, only the Suzhou silk factory purchased three tan (unit of weight) of warp silk from the Dechang silk factory, without any large transactions. It is expected that the price of spring cocoons will be difficult to improve, and the future of the rural economy will become more and more pessimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Crackdown on Silkworm Seed Storm Spreads <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction is vigorously cracking down on the breeding and sale of domestic silkworm seeds in various counties in order to promote improved silkworm seeds. After repeated opposition from silkworm farmers in various places failed, it aroused public anger. Farmers in Xiaoshan and Yuhang counties have successively rioted, burning improved fields, destroying district offices, farmers' associations, and schools, resulting in huge losses. After the first riot in Yuhang County, the Department of Construction sent Section Chief Zhang Fancun and others to investigate. When the villagers heard that the provincial committee had arrived, they blocked the road and knelt down, begging to postpone the crackdown. As a result, Zhang's car broke through and injured many villagers. Since the villagers could not get what they wanted, they continued to riot on the 5th and 6th, spreading to Lin'an and other counties, and the storm expanded. Although the Department of Construction sent troops to suppress it, it still could not be stopped. Yesterday, after representatives of various legal groups in the county came to the province to petition, the provincial government held a regular meeting today (7th) to discuss the repeated accidents in improving silkworm seeds, and the silkworm news is approaching, and it will take time to resolve. It was decided to allow the sale of domestic species in various counties and postpone the crackdown, and immediately send Secretary Li Yu to post notices and persuade shops to open in order to avoid expanding the situation, and order the provincial committee and the county government to discuss solutions for handling the aftermath.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Shang Zhen's Representative Cheng Qilu Talks About the Battle of Lengkou <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>"As Long as There is a Breath, I Will Never Allow the Enemy to Cross the Line!"</p>
<p>"The Alert Line Has Been Extended to More Than Twenty Li Outside the Pass"</p>
<p>Shanghai Times Electric News Agency Local News: Shang Zhen, the representative of the Second Army Corps of North China, Mr. Cheng Qilu, just returned from the battlefield. He personally witnessed the bloody battle of Lengkou. Because the public has been informed of the army's battle and defense situation, the detailed situation is still vague. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the previous day and planned to report to the local associations and other groups about the bloody battle of Lengkou. A reporter from the Shanghai Times News Agency visited his residence. He was kindly received and told the details of the army's battle. Details are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Current Strength of the Army <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Cheng, the army has three divisions, Huang Guanghua, Gao Hongwen, and Li Xingcun. Friendly troops under his command include He Zhuguo's unit of more than 10,000 people and Gao Guizi's unit of ☐☐ people, totaling more than ☐ 10,000 people. However, transportation equipment such as military telephones, trucks, steel helmets, and large knives are very lacking.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Loss of Lengkou <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Lengkou is the right wing of the entire North China line and an important passage to Pingjin. If Lengkou is lost, Pingjin will be threatened. At the same time, Gubeikou on the left wing and Xifengkou on the front will be in danger of being encircled. Therefore, Lengkou also occupies an important position in this military operation. After Chengde was lost, Lengkou also fell. Shang General Commander had been ordered by the Military Branch Association to take charge of the right wing. After hearing the news of the fall of Lengkou on the 4th, he ordered the Huang Guanghua Division of the army to advance north as soon as possible and arrive near Lengkou on the 6th. The enemy had increased from more than 200 people to more than 1,000 people. Armored vehicles had increased from more than a dozen to dozens, mixed with puppet army infantry and artillery units, and built a solid position in an attempt to hold the Lengkou pass.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Bloody Battle to Recapture Lengkou <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>At dawn on the 7th, our army ordered a counterattack on the enemy's position. The enemy resisted stubbornly, but our army was tragic and excited, and its spirit was multiplied. They took risks and charged. More than a dozen enemy armored vehicles were destroyed at the time, and the enemy's casualties were countless. It was not until 5:00 PM on the same day that the enemy could not support it and collapsed and retreated to the outside of the pass. The Huang Division, except for a part that remained to defend the recaptured Lengkou pass, the rest rushed out of the pass and pursued the victory. The enemy's reinforcements also arrived from the rear. The army resisted on one side and engaged in defense work on the other. The alert line was set up in Xiaojiaying and Madaogou.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Enemy Stubborn Resistance <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of the 21st, the enemy transferred four mixed detachments from Xifengkou and Gubeikou, and fierce battles were fought at the above locations. The position was gained and lost, and lost and regained, more than a dozen times. The enemy's momentum weakened slightly, and our army rushed out of the trenches. The enemy collapsed to the north. The enemy's corpses and dead horses blocked the road. After Lengkou was recaptured, the rear of Luanping was greatly consolidated. However, the peaks more than 20 miles outside the pass are still in the hands of the enemy. However, the enemy is determined to coexist and die with Lengkou. As long as there is a breath, the enemy will never be allowed to cross the line. According to the latest news, there will be a detailed telegram report within the day. However, the soldiers on the front line are using their lives to kill the enemy. The rear hopes that the whole country will be united in order to win the final victory.</p>

<p>Concentrate on Resisting the Enemy</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan's representative Xiao Zhenying made an important statement to the Daily News reporter yesterday, saying that Song Commander-in-Chief also serves as Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government. Because the enemy has captured Jehol and attacked North China, he is extremely angry. He led his troops to Xifeng to fight a bloody battle and fulfill his military duty. I have just received a telegram saying that Song Commander-in-Chief has telegraphed the National Government and Jiang Jieshi, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Executive Yuan, to remove him from the post of Chairman of Chahar, and concentrate on resisting the enemy. His merits are high and his humility is admirable. At the beginning of his restoration, President Wang Jingwei said in the memorial week that the habit of military separatism must be broken. Song Commander-in-Chief's request this time may also be intended to avoid suspicion.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Yu Hongjun Talks about Municipal Facilities <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Factory Inspection Promotes Concessions</p>
<p>Police Reform Difficult to Implement Immediately</p>
<p>Preparation for Collecting Land Value Tax Completed</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, yesterday and asked him about various issues related to municipal facilities. He was told as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e94">Factory Inspection <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Yu, after repeated consultations with Mr. Feixin Dun, President of the Municipal Council, regarding factory inspection, he can agree to our assistance. However, in terms of methods, he requires us to send trained inspection talents to be controlled by the concession side. However, the Factory Law was promulgated by the National Government, and the Municipal Government was ordered to implement it. This kind of requirement actually hinders our administrative power. Moreover, the citizens of the concession naturally comply with the orders of the Chinese government and are protected by the Chinese government. Therefore, the administrative power of the Chinese government can naturally be implemented in the concession, so that the Chinese and concession areas are treated equally. Therefore, there is no considerable result. According to the concession authorities, this issue will be handled in the amendment of the Yangjingbang Regulations at the annual meeting of Western taxpayers in this session. However, the Yangjingbang Regulations also clearly stipulate that the amendment of the articles must also be agreed to by the Chinese government before it can take effect.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Police System <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The reform of the police system, former Director Wen had this proposal, but it was not implemented due to the winter defense period. According to Mr. Yu, the implementation of the police system reform has not yet reached the implementation stage. This is because the various districts of Zhabei are busy with reorganization and revival, and at the same time, they want to enrich the police force and increase training efforts. The reform can be implemented only after these two tasks are completed. As for the relocation of the Public Security Bureau to the old Shanghai County site, because the county site is currently being renovated, it will probably take some time.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Tax Revenue <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>After the Director of the Finance Bureau negotiated with the concession authorities on entertainment donations, there has been no considerable result, so it is still difficult to collect. The business tax is in suspension. The preparations for collecting land value tax have been completed. The date of collection has not yet been determined, but it will be realized soon.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Revival Situation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since the allocation of funds for the plan to revive the prosperity of this city, it has been actively carried out. The construction of trunk roads, as well as the municipal library and hospital, have all been implemented in order, and the progress is quite rapid. In the city center area, the municipal government building and various trunk roads will also be completed separately. However, the entire project must be completed by the end of this year. Therefore, although the relocation of the municipal government agencies was possible in mid-July, it should be at the end of the year based on actual observation.</p>
<h3 id="e98">French Envoy Arrives This Morning <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The French envoy, Wei Lidun, went south from Ping and arrived in Beijing yesterday morning. He originally planned to come to Shanghai at 10:00 AM, but he did not arrive until the evening. The reporter inquired at the French Concession, and he was told that Wei did have news of arriving in Shanghai today. Because of the incident, he heard that he had changed to a night express train and would arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (this morning).</p>
<h3 id="e99">Western Merchants Also Gradually Comply with Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News said that regarding the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, in addition to the Chinese banks deciding to change all the tael accounts to yuan accounts according to the fixed rate, the latest progress of the Western merchants is as follows: (1) HSBC Bank has decided that from next week, all foreign exchange rates will be calculated in silver yuan, such as how many pence can be exchanged for one yuan of national currency, how many cents for US dollars, how many francs for French francs, and how many marks for German marks; (2) The Shanghai Western Merchants Exchange Association has discussed the policy of agreement and unified action, but has not yet issued a formal statement; (3) The London Stock Exchange no longer quotes in taels; (4) A large number of cargo contracts in this port have been changed from taels to silver yuan according to the fixed rate; (5) Western merchants have discussed the issue that contracts in taels will not be accepted by the court in the future. In addition, it is also confirmed that the pattern of the new national currency will also be slightly changed, but the weight and fineness will be absolutely unaffected according to the legal standard.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Failure of Yoshizawa's Visit to China <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart Shanghai Northward Today</p>
<p>Departure Not Intended as Negative Report on China</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reports that former Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, in a conversation with representatives of foreign newspapers in Shanghai today (the 7th), stated that his visit to Shanghai was purely of a personal nature. Claims in Chinese newspapers that he was charged with direct negotiations with the Chinese government were entirely baseless. He mentioned that he had been away from Shanghai for four years and was visiting to experience the atmosphere of central China and to observe everything on the ground. He did not bear any formal or semi-formal mission. He is scheduled to travel north to Tianjin and Beijing tomorrow (the 8th), and then proceed to Manchuria for a week before returning to Tokyo. His purpose in visiting Manchuria is to investigate the development of "that country." When asked about his opinion on the Four-Power Agreement, Yoshizawa replied that British Prime Minister MacDonald's efforts seemed to have succeeded. However, since the British Prime Minister announced the progress of the matter in the House of Commons, Japan has not heard of any further developments. It is said that the agreement has been shelved due to France's attitude. When questioned about his views on disarmament, Yoshizawa responded that although the Disarmament Conference still exists and Japanese representatives still participate in its meetings, the atmosphere is not very promising. Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it will continue to cooperate with the major powers to maintain world peace. While the future is uncertain, it appears that the Japanese government's policy will not deviate from cooperation with the major powers. The discussion then turned to the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods. Yoshizawa said that even if the boycott movement intensifies, the Japanese government will not take any special actions. However, if Chinese actions become excessive and cause unexpected incidents or violence, he is certain that the Japanese government will take appropriate measures. The boycott movement is a matter of serious concern for the Japanese government, and it will take measures to deal with it if necessary. Finally, regarding the Philippine Islands issue, Yoshizawa replied with a smile that the independence of the Philippine Islands is not Japan's concern at all.</p>

The budget for start-up costs and recurring expenses was assigned to Lin Kanghou and Lin Wo Jiang for review. (2) A proposal to add two Standing Committee members to the Fund Management Committee was approved, with Song Hanzhang and Xu Yongzuo added as Standing Committee members. (3) Due to the increasing development of the National Salvation Through Aviation movement, the association should increase the number of directors to concentrate the efforts of leaders from all sectors of the country. It was decided to request the National Government to appoint eight additional directors, as well as several other routine matters. The meeting adjourned at 6:45 PM.

<p>Polish Commercial Consul Sir Kreczynski is about to return home on leave, and the new Consul Mr. Wolbin has arrived in Shanghai. He visited He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, a few days ago to inquire about Sino-Polish trade. He noted that the country's exports to China, such as cotton textiles, copper, and iron, were substantial, and imports such as cotton and local products were also significant. To foster goodwill and promote foreign trade, he specially hosted a banquet last night at the Xing Hua Lou restaurant on Four Horses Road for the outgoing and incoming Consuls. The director of the bureau, Guo Weibai, Ji Zejin, Guan Zhonglin, Zhu Yinong, and specialists Gao Lu, Hou Houpei, and Zhang Pansun attended. There was extensive discussion on Sino-Polish trade, with lively conversation and many toasts. The gathering concluded at 10 PM after a pleasant evening.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Wuxi Chinese Cotton Mills to Hold Regular Meetings to Discuss Production Reduction Measures <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Reason Being Forced by Overproduction</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that there has been talk recently of Shanghai cotton mills collectively discussing production reduction measures. A Xin Sheng She reporter, considering cotton yarn to be China's largest industry and the implications of a sudden reduction in production to be far-reaching, visited a leader in the cotton industry to inquire about the situation and the reasons for the reduction. The leader provided a detailed explanation, stating that in the past two years, all industries in the country have been declining. The reasons are, on the one hand, the global economic recession, overproduction, and efforts to promote foreign trade. China's low tariffs have resulted in a dumping ground for foreign goods. This is how Chinese industries are experiencing the pain of the global economic recession. On the other hand, there are reasons specific to China itself. Since the massive floods in the Yangtze River basin in 1931, banditry has spread, and the rural economy is on the verge of collapse. Purchasing power has greatly decreased, and the sales of all goods are less than half of what they were in the past. The September 18th and January 28th incidents followed, and the national financial situation was greatly affected, severely impacting industry. The cotton yarn industry, as China's largest industry, is experiencing even greater pain than other industries. This is because, in addition to Chinese merchants, there are also foreign cotton mills in the country, with spindles almost equal in number to those of Chinese mills. This is unique to the cotton industry and a hardship not shared by other industries. The raw material for cotton mills is cotton. Domestic cotton production, both in terms of quality and quantity, cannot meet demand, and prices are too high. Leaving aside the distant past, in 1931, the lowest price for standard yarn was 145 taels and 2 mace, and the lowest price for standard cotton was 30 taels, 3 mace, and 5 fen. In 1932, the lowest price for standard yarn was 138 taels and 3 mace, and standard cotton was 27 taels. This year, in March, the lowest market price for standard yarn was 132 taels and 6 mace, and standard cotton was 30 taels and 7 mace and 5 fen. Comparing this year with 1932, the price of yarn has fallen by 5 taels and 7 mace, while the price of cotton has risen by 3 taels and 7 mace and 5 fen. Compared with 1931 (the standard for yarn and cotton in 1933 was different from that in 1931; if the 1933 standard is converted to the equivalent of the 1931 standard, the standard would be 120 taels and 6 mace, and the standard cotton would be approximately 29 taels), the price of cotton yarn has fallen by 24 taels and 6 mace, while the price of cotton has risen by 2 taels. From this simple comparison of prices, it is clear what the trend of yarn and cotton prices has been in the past two years and how the cotton mills are operating. This is from the perspective of raw materials. Now, let's talk about the sales of finished products. Under the current domestic economic situation, the sales of all goods are sluggish, but cotton yarn is particularly so. China imports the most cotton goods, as anyone familiar with the customs trade situation knows. Secondly, foreign mills account for almost half of the spindles in the country, and the yarn and cloth they produce are naturally sold domestically. This is an external competition that is unique to the cotton mills. Since the September 18th Incident, the sales of yarn and cloth in the three northeastern provinces have been completely occupied by Japanese domestic goods. Increasingly, new yarn and cloth made by Japanese factories in China are being shipped to northern China due to strict restrictions on goods in southern China and the Yangtze River. Therefore, before long, Chinese-owned yarn and cloth factories in northern China will have no room to gain a foothold, eventually forcing yarn from Tianjin and Shanxi factories to be shipped south. This is a rare phenomenon in the past, and Shanghai is feeling the sluggish sales even more. Since last summer, Japanese factories have been using dumping tactics in northern China and have seen success. They are now promoting this tactic in the Yangtze River region. Therefore, since last winter, yarn sales in the Yangtze River region have gradually decreased, and the inventory of yarn in Shanghai has been increasing month by month, reaching a massive 140,000 to 150,000 bales. This has forced the discussion of production reduction measures. It is now proposed to stop production for two or three days each week, reducing the original production by about one-third, to reduce production and better match consumption. This is because the factory owners are thinking of the workers and are making the minimum possible reduction in production, hoping that the environment will improve. If they do not seek to maintain the current situation and allow the current deteriorating situation to continue, it will soon be worse than reducing production by one-third. At that time, what will be the plight of the workers? It seems that Shanghai cotton mills have already decided to reduce production. It is reported that the Cotton Mill Association will hold a general membership meeting on the 10th, bringing together factories from Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Wuxi to jointly decide on and implement the measures uniformly. All the details of the production reduction measures are still to be decided at the meeting on the 10th.</p>

<h3 id="e105">British Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting Report <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Commercial Counsellor Peel's Speech</p>
<p>British Goods Imports Still Maintain Old Status</p>
<p>Trust in China's Great Future</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that at yesterday's (6th) annual meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, British Commercial Counsellor Peel gave a speech, in which he stated the following regarding Sino-foreign trade: Last year was difficult to compare with previous years due to the Manchurian problem. In 1931, Manchurian exports accounted for 35% of the total national exports, while its imports only accounted for 10% to 11% of the national total. However, from our perspective, the brightest point last year was that imports of British goods were still able to maintain their old status, with no decrease of even a penny compared to 1931. On the contrary, our major competitors all saw sharp declines, such as the United States, which decreased by no less than 92 million Haikwan taels, France by 8 million taels, and Germany by 12 million taels. Moreover, in the major imported goods, such as cotton textiles, British goods saw an increase. Furthermore, the British goods that can compete with other countries in China's import trade are all manufactured goods. Considering the total amount of manufactured goods imported into China this year, Britain accounted for no less than 24%, a large increase over the previous year. Also, in 1931, the value of British goods imported accounted for just over 8% of the total value of imports into China, while last year it accounted for 11.5%, an increase of no less than 40% compared to the previous year. According to last year's customs report, the value of goods imported from the United States ranked first, but 80% of these were food and raw materials. In terms of manufactured goods, the value of British imports was twice that of the United States. Peel also stated that last year, China experienced an even more significant phenomenon: the ability of its people to withstand all kinds of terrible blows, such as the occupation of Manchuria, the Shanghai Incident, and major floods. In his view, China has a great future. He has deep trust not only in China's future but also in the future of the world. He believes that the responsibility of the British lies in working with other nations to resolutely advance towards reason and progress, for the benefit of others, and that they will also gain great glory. China's greatest need today lies in clearing debts and restoring credit. If it does not focus on these two goals, it will not be able to achieve great development. However, he believes that those in power are currently paying sincere attention to this. In his address, Chairman Marshall first described the impact of China's foreign troubles and internal worries, and its ability to still balance its budget. He then analyzed the Sino-foreign trade situation last year, stating that the United States ranked first in Sino-foreign trade, accounting for 21.16%, Japan ranked second, accounting for 17.07%, Britain ranked third, accounting for 10.07%, and Hong Kong ranked fourth, accounting for 8.71%. However, a large part of Hong Kong's trade with China naturally represents Sino-British trade. He then discussed the Ministry of Railways' clearing of debts and progress in railway construction, the new regulations of the customs requiring imported goods to be labelled with the country of origin in Chinese characters, the purchasing power of the Chinese people, and the construction of roads, disaster relief, and the development of transportation facilities. Regarding China's commerce and industry, we must know that the area of this country is almost like a continent, and the population is large, but the average wealth per person is very small. Therefore, its material progress, when compared with its area and population, is slow. But when compared with the average wealth per person, it is not so slow. On the same day, after passing the report and re-electing new directors, the meeting adjourned and the annual meeting of the British Community in China Association was convened.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Dai Yongtang, Director of the Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office, Assumes Office <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Collection Scheduled to Begin on April 15th</p>
<p>Also Discusses the Relationship Between Fee Collection and Fishermen</p>
<p>The Industry Ministry's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee has established an office to collect fishery construction fees and has resolved to have Committee Member Dai Yongtang concurrently serve as Director of the Collection Office, as previously reported. It has now been learned that since being appointed, Dai has been actively preparing and deploying everything. He has divided the important production and sales locations within the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region into ten districts, and officially began work on the morning of the 6th, announcing the start of operations. The collection office is located in Changan Lane on Huangjia Que Road in Xiaoximen. Dai also spoke about the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the office by the Industry Ministry's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee to collect fishery construction fees, in accordance with the resolution of the Central Political Conference. The process has been very difficult. It has now been decided that the construction fee will begin to be collected on April 15th. Fearing that various sectors may not yet understand the truth, he is publishing the circumstances as follows: Last year, foreign vessels were encroaching on our fishing grounds with increasing urgency. In order to reorganize the domestic fishing industry, it was originally planned to collect a fishery product tax of 5% of the value, according to the Fishery Law. Our fishing industry felt deeply that it could not afford to increase the burden at this time of decline in the fishing industry. Therefore, various Jiangsu and Zhejiang fishing groups united to form a Tax Exemption Committee, showing their collective opposition. Since then, letters and telegrams have been exchanged, repeatedly requesting the central government to maintain the original tax exemption order. Later, after Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry traveled back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai, and engaged in several sincere consultations with fishing industry leaders, the fishery tax was reduced from 5% to 2%. Fishing industry leaders also believed that using the name "fishery tax" would inevitably lead to increases in the future. Moreover, since it was called a fishery tax, it would be one of the national tax revenues. Once collected, it might not necessarily be taken from fisheries and used for fisheries. Therefore, they unanimously requested that the collected fee be absolutely designated as a fishery construction fee and that the fishing industry have the right to manage, audit, and distribute the funds to ensure credibility. The Minister adopted these suggestions one by one, and after several careful discussions, it was decided to change the fee to a fishery construction fee of 2% of the market value of fishery products, collected once. Whether fresh, salted, dried, or shellfish, all are required to pay the construction fee to show no favoritism. Those less than 100 catties or small-scale hawkers are exempt from the fee. Once the agreement was reached, the Ministry, provincial government, municipal government, Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai fishing industry, and various experts jointly organized the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee to achieve the real effect of cooperation between the government and the people. Since the establishment of the Fisheries Improvement Committee, it has been ordered by the Ministry to collect the fishery construction fee. The meeting also resolved (1) that the fees collected will be used exclusively to protect the safety of the fishing industry, to manage the strictest possible ocean protection, to add ocean patrol ships, and for the necessary construction for the fishery industry. (2) Once the construction fee is collected, the ocean protection fee will be stopped altogether, and all the miscellaneous expenses that fishermen previously bore, such as various ship licenses, will be cancelled. (3) Recently, Committee Member Du Yuesheng and others proposed that, in order to reduce the burden on fishermen, the collection of the construction fee should be further reduced to 1%. In summary, our fishermen fulfill the minimum obligations and receive the greatest benefits. Anyone who understands the matter should celebrate the revival of the fishing industry, which is now dependent on this. Yongtang was erroneously promoted by the committee to the position of Director of the Collection Office. Realizing his lack of talent and heavy responsibility, he originally dared not accept. However, as a member of the fishing community, at this time of extreme decline in the fishing industry, now that the government has the determination to reorganize the fishing industry, how can our fishing community be willing to lag behind? Therefore, without considering his inadequacy, he immediately obeyed the order to prepare. The office has now been formally established, and the collection is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month. Believing that construction depends on funding, and that small contributions can make a large coat, with every bit of financial strength, a bit of work can be done, he deeply hopes that his colleagues in the fishing industry will happily contribute, so that the various fishery improvement construction plans that we deeply expect can be carried out in an orderly manner, and then the future of the fishing industry may be hopeful.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Meat Inspection Dispute: Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Ministry Requesting Resolution <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>And Sends Letter to Health Bureau Requesting Storage of Detained Goods</p>
<p>The local ham and preserved meat industry opposes the meat inspection case. However, the Municipal Health Bureau has implemented inspections this month, resulting in the recent arrival of goods from the industry being detained and exposed at the station. Rain and wind are causing the meat products to rot. The industry specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting protection. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in addition to forwarding the letter to the Municipal Health Bureau for investigation, also sent a telegram to the Industry Ministry of the Executive Yuan, requesting a prompt resolution. The original texts are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry: To the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, The inspection of preserved meats in this city was ordered to be cancelled by your (Executive) Yuan on December 30th of last year, after a presentation from the two industry associations. Barely three months later, the Municipal Health Bureau is again setting up words to continue the operation, disregarding national laws and regulations. We have already telegraphed jointly, requesting another order to stop it, but we have not received a reply. Now, according to reports from the industry, the Health Bureau is forcibly detaining goods and accumulating them in the open air. Over time, this will likely cause them to spoil, which contradicts the stated goal of hygiene. If this matter is not resolved quickly by the Ministry, merchants will suffer huge losses in cost. Please expedite the matter urgently. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Letter to the Health Bureau: Dear Sirs, We have received a letter from the Ham Industry Association stating that the issue of forcing the cancellation of inspections has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Recently, the Municipal Health Bureau has suddenly implemented inspections, publishing a notice two days ago. As a result, the goods of our colleagues that were en route were unable to stop in time due to this bolt from the blue. Therefore, in the past two or three days, more than a hundred pieces of ham and wind-dried meat newly transported from Hangzhou have been stopped by police officers sent by the Health Bureau after arriving in Shanghai, and are piled up in the open air of the South Station, without allowing any movement. As the weather warms up, the heat of the sun is quite strong during the day. Piling them up for too long will inevitably turn these items, which were originally hygienic, into unsanitary goods. Moreover, the Municipal Health Bureau is loudly proclaiming that the implementation of meat inspection is for the sake of protecting the health of meat-eating citizens. If this is the case, does it not greatly contradict what they say? Moreover, the requests for cancellation made by the association have been made from the standpoint of law and reason. Even if the Health Bureau is determined to achieve its goal of inspection and fee collection, it should also be reasonable to follow legal procedures. Today, instead of doing so, they are forcing the goods arriving at the station to be piled up in the open air. There is nothing more vicious than this method. Considering the future of the industry and the national legislation, our industry is determined not to accept any inspection or payment of fees before the case has been properly determined. However, the value of the goods that have arrived is very large, so we have no choice but to report the situation. We hope that you will uphold the principle of protecting commerce and contact the Municipal Health Bureau to first have the shipping company that handled the goods transport and store them properly to avoid unexpected events. This is in the public interest. We have found that the officials and merchants in this city are still disputing over the implementation of meat inspection. How it will be resolved in the future should be awaited. However, before the Executive Yuan issues a clear order, the official should not impose restrictions on the business activities of the industry. The request in the letter, before the case has been properly resolved, that even if the industry's meat products must be detained due to not accepting inspection and payment of fees, they should be stored properly in a selected location to avoid the meat products from being exposed to the sun and becoming easily rotten, is a legitimate request. We are sending you a letter requesting that you investigate and allow the shipping company handling the obstructed meat products in the open air to transport and store them properly to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Government Measures to Rescue the Silk Industry <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Plans Relief Based on On-Site Investigations</p>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, Vice Chairman of the National Economic Commission, realizing that China's silk industry is on the verge of extinction and must be rescued, specifically assigned commissioners in the past few months to go to the silk regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to conduct on-site investigations and thorough research. Based on the results of the investigation and research, he formulated a rescue plan that includes solutions to various problems such as mulberry planting, seed production, silkworm cocoon sales, silk reeling, and maintaining silk factories. It is reported that experiments on crossbred silkworm rearing will be started at the Hangzhou Women's Sericulture School, and model silkworm farming experimental areas will be established in Xiaoshan and Jintan counties to test the silkworm varieties for suitability to the Chinese climate and the capabilities of the silkworm farmers, and whether the resulting silkworm cocoons can indeed increase silk production. More than ninety guidance centers will be set up in the Xiaoshan and Jintan experimental areas, each with a silkworm rearing room and a baking room, until the end of the second molt. The number of silkworm eggs to be tested is estimated to be more than 23,000 sheets, and the number of farmers who will be influenced and gain experience in rearing their young silkworms with good methods is estimated to be more than 27,000 households, which is quite staggering. However, it is said that the government will not stop there, but plans to use the two experimental areas as a starting point to gradually expand to the whole country, and will not stop until the Chinese silk industry has restored its position in the world market. It is also reported that the funds for the implementation of the preliminary plan have all been raised.</p>

<p>丨Very Organized丨</p>
<p>Yan Fuqing, President of the National Shanghai Medical College and concurrently President of the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, previously, due to the urgency of the war in North China and the need to care for wounded soldiers, led more than twenty physicians and medical students from the college to Peiping in mid-July. They organized a hospital for wounded soldiers, which is now ready. Mr. Yan returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday to handle hospital affairs and made the following statement: This time, the organization of medical relief work in the North is very orderly, with the North China Relief Committee as the backbone. The committee is composed of fourteen medical leaders, with Liu Ruiheng as Director and myself and Jiang Tiren as Deputy Directors. A total of 150 volunteer medical personnel were sent by major medical institutions in the country, including forty from Peiping Union Medical College, twenty-one from National Shanghai Medical College, ten from National Peiping University Medical College, twenty from Qilu University Medical College, twelve from Xiangya Medical College, and others from Central Hospital and the Ministry of Health. Medical circles in various places are also preparing to mobilize, and they can set off as soon as needed. In this war, the total number of wounded soldiers in Rehe and North China is six to seven thousand, of whom five thousand have been accommodated in the battlefield and rear hospitals established by the Committee. To facilitate the reception of wounded soldiers from outside the pass, the Committee has established wounded soldier hospitals at Xifengkou, Gubeikou, and Duolun in Peiping. The three hospitals in Zunhua, Miyun, and Kangzhuang are all equipped with ambulance teams, with medicines for treatment prepared in the vehicles, rushing to the front line for transport. Two rear hospitals are set up in Peiping, one in Shifuyuan and one in Feng Yong University. The above two can accommodate 1,300 seriously wounded soldiers. In addition, a rear hospital is set up in Tongzhou, specializing in severely wounded soldiers. The above three are central coordinating agencies for rescue and treatment, sending those with severe injuries and light injuries to hospitals set up by the Military Medical Directorate along the Jinpu Railway. In addition to working hard to rescue, the Committee also provides medical supplies to wounded soldier hospitals in various places, and within its possible range, sends doctors and nurses to assist the hospitals established by the Military Medical Directorate. In short, the relief work this time is well-organized, does not cost much money, and has achieved great results. The spirit of the people who report their services from all over the place is excellent.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram from Li Cishan yesterday, reporting that Zhu Jiqing's troops were experiencing supply difficulties and requesting assistance. At the same time, it also received donations from prisoners in the Wu County Detention Center who reduced their food rations to donate to the Volunteer Army, and a telegram from Army Commander Sun Dianying, stating that they had already received clothes and blankets for military use. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e114">Telegram Requesting Assistance for Zhu Jiqing's Troops <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association: We received a telegram from Mr. Zhu Jiqing in Jiangxi on a subtle day, opening a telegram from Tianjin, and the Shanghai Support Association assisted our army with another 5,000 yuan, for which we are deeply grateful. At this moment, due to the supply of Sun Zhaoyin, Song Jiuling, and the Third Route Wang Xianting, Peng Xiaoqiu, the detachment Zheng Shuzhen, and local militia maintenance costs, a large amount of money is needed.

<p>Cheng Shugen, Yang Zongbao, Wang Chengqi, Wang Rongliang, Jiang Jinhe, Cha Genpei, Tan Zhongjia, and other fifty-eight male prisoners, and Wei Wang, Bao Wu, and other twenty female prisoners in the First Detention Center of Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, have reduced their food rations for three days, accumulating twenty-three yuan and forty cents in silver dollars to assist the Volunteer Army. They have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, stating briefly: The prisoners are trapped in prison. Since Director Sun took office, he has worked hard on prison affairs and gave speeches on the national crisis and assistance. Hearing that the Japanese pirates in the Northeast, since the September 18th Incident last year, have led their ugly creatures to invade our land and cruelly kill our compatriots. Fortunately, our patriotic Volunteer Army, vowing to kill the enemy, sacrificed themselves on the battlefield, and received donations from the whole country. The prisoners are all tearful. Alas, the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. The prisoners belong to China's territory, descendants of Yan and Huang, and regret being trapped in prison, unable to jump up to kill the enemy to repay the motherland. Fortunately, the country's grace provides rations, allowing the prisoners to buy food to fill their hunger. They are willing to reduce their food rations for three days, and Director Sun has graciously allowed them to provide food and funds. They have accumulated twenty-three yuan and forty cents in silver dollars to assist the Volunteer Army in killing the enemy. They request Director Sun's permission to mail the funds to Shanghai, respectfully requesting that they not abandon their meager efforts and do their utmost to express their patriotic sincerity. They urge that it be published in various newspapers to arouse assistance from prisons and capitalists across the country. If the National Government needs to send prisoners to fight the enemy, they dare to sacrifice their flesh and blood to kill the enemy.</p>

<p>The Zhengji Company's head office is in Yingkou, and a branch is located on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession of Shanghai. The Guangli ship is a miscellaneous ship (commonly known as a "wild chicken ship"), specializing in carrying passengers and cargo, sailing to Niuzhuang, Qingdao, Fujian, Shanghai, and other places, with a deadweight of 1,200 tons. It departed from Qingdao the day before yesterday, carrying cargo to Dalian. At about 4:00 PM on the sixth, when it was sailing to Jiming Island about eighteen miles east of Weihaiwei, it encountered heavy fog and collided with the Japanese ship Kyodo Maru No. 36, which was sailing from Weihaiwei to Incheon, Korea.</p>

At the same time, the Guangli ship towed the Japanese ship to Weihaiwei for berthing. The Japanese ship has now entered the dock for repairs. The Guangli ship decided to sail to Dalian before repairing.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Insurance Dispute over the Jianhua Factory, the Center of the January 28th Front Line in Northeast China <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>丨Zhang Shenzhi Accuses Xie Ruisen of Embezzling Insurance Money丨</p>
<p>The Jianhua Shenji Textile Factory was originally opened on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei. During the January 28th incident, when the Japanese invaded Shanghai, the factory was located at the center of the front line. Its manager, Zhang Shenzhi, at the time, because the factory's machinery, wealth, and goods were worth more than 100,000 taels of gold, in order to protect the property, took out a war risk insurance policy for 100,000 taels of silver with Xie Ruisen, manager of the Baoxing Insurance Company on the upper floor of the HSBC Bank on Fuzhou Road, on the day after the outbreak of the war (January 29th). It was divided into two types: (1) 70,000 taels for machinery, (2) 30,000 taels for goods, with a term of one month and an insurance premium of 3,000 taels of silver. On the same day, Xie gave Zhang two insurance policies. After Zhang reviewed them, he learned that Xie was reinsuring with Dechang Company, so the insurance policies were issued by Dechang. Zhang believed that this kind of reinsurance was common in the insurance industry, so he did not object and immediately paid a draft from Yuanda Bank for 3,000 taels. On February 5th, when Yuanda opened for business, Xie entrusted the draft to Hengxun Bank for encashment. On the 19th of that month, Zhang learned that the Jianhua Factory had been bombed by Japanese planes and immediately informed Xie Ruisen and asked whether a written report was needed. Xie replied that a written report was not needed and that he would forward the information to Dechang, the insurer. However, after the Japanese planes began bombing the factory on the 19th, they did not stop, and the entire factory was destroyed in three days. Zhang also continued to inform Xie of the tragic situation. Unexpectedly, Xie suddenly sent a letter to Zhang, stating that Dechang Company, the insurer, had declared its withdrawal from insurance to him as early as February 2nd, and that he had also notified Zhang by letter the day after Dechang's withdrawal, so he was no longer responsible for the insurance. Zhang was shocked upon receiving the letter and has been negotiating with Xie ever since, for more than a year. Not only has he not received any compensation for his losses, but the 3,000 taels of insurance premium he paid has also been thrown into a bottomless pit. Now, he has hired lawyer E Sen to file a criminal self-accusation against Xie Ruisen for embezzling the draft, stating that the defendant's claim that he had notified the withdrawal of insurance by letter on February 3rd is entirely fabricated. If that were the case, why did the defendant still take the insurance premium draft he paid to the bank for encashment on February 5th? And when Zhang sent personnel and a letter to inform him of the damage to the factory site on February 19th, why was there no declaration of withdrawal? Since Dechang had withdrawn insurance from the defendant, the defendant should have notified the plaintiff and returned the 3,000 taels of insurance premium. However, the defendant did not do this, but instead cashed the draft and concealed the fact that Dechang had declared its withdrawal, which was obviously an intentional embezzlement of the insurance premium and violated the provisions of Article 356 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, he has filed a lawsuit requesting the arrest of the defendant and to be punished according to the law. Due to the defendant's illegal embezzlement and concealment of facts, the plaintiff has suffered losses and hereby files a civil lawsuit as an attachment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan of the First Special District Local Court held a hearing, but the defendant was absent. His lawyer claimed that the defendant had left Shanghai for business and requested a postponement. However, the plaintiff's lawyer, E Sen, stated that the defendant had been appointed as the director of the Insurance Department of the Four Banks' Reserve Treasury yesterday and would not have left Shanghai, so his lawyer's statement was not credible. The court then ruled that the defendant had formally requested a postponement in advance and granted the request, adjourning the hearing to the afternoon of April 25th.</p>

According to labor union representative Gao Depei, a lawsuit is now planned to be filed in court against Jintai Hsiang for arresting labor union representatives and falsely accusing them of assaulting employees.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Cheap National Goods Store <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Founding Manifesto</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Trading Company, which recently moved to the corner of Nanjing Road and Shilu, recently established a cheap national goods market at its new location on the corner of Nanjing Road and Shilu to assist national goods factories affected by the war in selling their inventory, circulate capital, seek progress in craftsmanship, and sell their products at low prices, thereby expanding business promotion. They unite in the spirit of strength and sacrifice to resist the dumping of counterfeit Japanese goods. Yesterday, in order to make all circles understand its organization, it specially published the founding manifesto of the cheap national goods market. The annex is as follows: Under the bloody hacking on the front line, the work of advocating national goods in the rear is particularly important, because advocating national goods can develop industry, increase production, stabilize workers' lives, and make the order in the rear and the strength of support increasingly consolidated and strengthened. Advocating national goods is not only aimed at developing industry and increasing production, but also at eliminating Japanese goods, because Japanese goods are the grain platform that aids enemy troops in running rampant in the Northeast, destroying alliances, and disrupting peace. If we want to preserve peace, uphold alliances, and aid the loving troops who are hacking and slashing in the front line, we must unanimously attack the grain platform that aids the enemy troops. This is undeniable. Treacherous merchants who have lost their minds and are acting as accomplices are helping the enemy by means of counterfeit sales and dumping at reduced prices, sacrificing themselves and killing others to slaughter our anti-Japanese soldiers and compatriots in distress. Under this environment, we cannot but open up another path in this port on the corner of Nanjing Road and Shilu, in addition to assisting various national goods factories and promoting them in various ports at home and abroad, in order to resist the policy of dumping counterfeit Japanese goods, on the one hand, so that patriotic people with weak purchasing power will not be deceived by treacherous merchants again, and on the other hand, to respond to the struggle of various national goods companies in different ways. We are now entrusted by the takers of the Anlu Cotton Mill to unite the national goods silks, thermos bottles, rubber overshoes, various colored stockings, and other daily necessities, etc., worth more than 100,000 yuan in the entire factory, with the national goods silks and satins, thermos bottles, rubber overshoes, various colored stockings, and other daily necessities, etc., worth more than 10,000 yuan that have expired from bank mortgages, to sell them at low prices in the cheap national goods market, in order to resist the dumping of counterfeit Japanese goods, and strive to eliminate the production and financing of the grain platform that aids enemy troops. The purpose of our founding of the cheap national goods market is, in addition to resisting the dumping of counterfeit Japanese goods, to make the most lively location on Nanjing Road available to national goods factories that have not set up retail departments or have retail locations in remote areas. All factories that have too much inventory due to the impact of the war can entrust their inventory to be sold at low prices, or factories that are striving to promote new goods can entrust their new goods to be promoted at low prices. There are separate regulations for the entrustment methods. We hope that all national goods factories will stand on the front line of attacking the grain platform that aids the enemy and use the spirit of sacrifice of low-price sales to resist the policy of dumping counterfeit goods by treacherous merchants, in order to expand the propaganda of national goods that are truly useful.</p>

<p>During the January 28th incident last year, many rogues and hooligans were willing to be traitors, working for the enemy, while righteous people and warriors also rose up to resist. Therefore, there were occasional killings of compatriots. Wang Bingzhai and others, villagers of Jinjia Lane, Xiangyin Road, Hudong, were willing to be spies for the enemy, carrying out reconnaissance and transportation work for them. There was a river in the area, and Wang built a wooden bridge to facilitate the enemy's progress. It was discovered by Quan Baogen, Xu Shengqing, Cai Yaoxiang, Xu Jinfu, and others, who went to the bridge at night and tore it down. Wang Fuzhai and others, being supported by the enemy, lay in wait and shot and killed Quan Baogen. After the area was quiet, Wang fled, while Xu Shengqing and others were arrested on suspicion by the local court. It has now been confirmed by the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Reconnaissance Team that Wang Bingzhai and Jin Guoting (also known as Ma Pi) were actually traitors who committed murder. Detective Hu Kuisheng was dispatched to arrest Wang Bingzhai and arrest Jin Guoting to be investigated and dealt with. Wang Bingzhai has now confessed, so the local court has filed a lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Zhu conducted a preliminary investigation and ordered them to be returned to custody to await further interrogation of the remaining accomplices.</p>

<p>Small Restaurant Cooks and Sells Puffer Fish Roe</p>
<p>Three Customers Accidentally Eat It and Cause Disaster</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Xu Xiaogen from Jiangyin (yesterday's extra mistakenly reported Zhang Da) and his friend Li Zhikui purchased and ate the fish roe at Qian Fuxing Small Restaurant in Guanyinge, and died of poisoning after returning home. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Xu's Wife Comes to Shanghai <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xiaogen from Jiangyin is currently 51 years old and has always been a dock worker. His home is in the countryside of his hometown. His wife, Chen, has a son named Baolang, who is currently 18 years old and has been an apprentice at Lu Faxiang Garment Shop at No. 148 Tianguanfang, Danfeng Road, Xinbeimen, in this port. Xu Er, because he had not been to Shanghai for a long time, specially took a boat to Shanghai a few days ago. After arriving at the port the day before yesterday, he stayed at the home of his fellow villager Zhu Laoming at No. 70 Dasheng Lane, Xiaodongmen, planning to inquire about his son's recent situation the next day.</p>

<p>At about 7:00 PM that day, Xu invited his friend Li Zhikui to Qian Fuxing Small Restaurant at No. 34 Guanyinge, Xinkaihe, for dinner. The restaurant was opened by Qian Shouchang from Zhenjiang and has been in operation for four years. The business has been fairly good on weekdays, but all the equipment in the restaurant is simple and crude, so those who go there to eat are mostly coolies. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Qian, tempted by the low price, bought a large batch of puffer fish roe outside and brought it back to the restaurant, cooked it, and put it in large basins on the table for customers to choose from.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Two People Gobble It Up <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>At that time, Xu and others stepped into the restaurant and saw the fish roe displayed on the table, which was bright red in color and fragrant. They ordered the waiter to serve a large bowl (worth 15 silver dollars) on the table, with white rice. The two immediately gathered together to gobble it up. Because the taste was very delicious, they quickly swallowed a large bowl of fish roe and six bowls of white rice into their stomachs. After eating, they settled the bill and left the restaurant, returning home separately. Xu returned to Zhu's house at about 8:00 PM. Seeing that Zhu and his wife, Zhou, were already asleep, he took off his clothes and went to bed to sleep.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Xu Dies of Abdominal Distension <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Around 11:00 PM, the pain caused by the fish roe suddenly swelled up in Xu's abdomen. Xu suddenly felt as if his abdomen was cut by a knife and woke up in pain from his dream, rolling around in bed. Zhu and his wife were also awakened and got up to check. They saw that Xu's face was pale and his breathing was short. After questioning, they learned that what he had eaten earlier was puffer fish roe, which was poisonous and caused abdominal pain. They immediately called a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, by the time the doctor arrived, it was too late to save him, and he had already died.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Li Also Dies in Pain <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhikui is currently 34 years old and is from the same hometown as Xu. He lives at No. 23 Guanyinge, Xinkaihe. After eating dinner with Xu at the restaurant, he returned home and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 PM, he also suddenly felt abdominal pain like a绞, and was rushed to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by his friend Chen Wenkui. However, because he had eaten too much puffer fish roe, the fish roe swelled up in his abdomen, and he was deeply poisoned. As a result, he had just arrived at the hospital when he died before being rescued. His body was temporarily displayed at the entrance of the hospital.</p>

<p>Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the incident was learned by the No. 2 Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Director Liu immediately dispatched police chief Li Fuyi and others to investigate at No. 70 Dasheng Lane. Then, they went to Guanyinge and arrested Qian Shouchang, the owner of Qian Fuxing Small Restaurant, and brought the remaining puffer fish roe back to the precinct. After preliminary interrogation by the director, Qian was found to be greedy for profit, selling puffer fish roe, and causing the death of human lives, which was extremely hateful. He was ordered to be detained temporarily, pending verification. Zhou Linshu, the chief of the tenth shop, was ordered to report to the Shanghai Local Court and request an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Another Person <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>As for Li Zhikui, who died at Shanghai Hospital, Qin Defang, the chief of the twenty-third shop of the First District, was also dispatched by the director to report to the court and request the dispatch of personnel for an autopsy. However, there were more than just Xu and Li who purchased and ate the fish roe at Qian Fuxing Small Restaurant. However, these diners have all scattered, so it is still difficult to know the exact number of those who have been poisoned. There is also one person who has been discovered. His name is Huang Youcheng, currently 24 years old, also from Jiangyin, who has always made a living by scavenging. After eating the fish roe at the restaurant the night before last, he returned home and felt abdominal pain at 11:00 PM, rolling around on the ground. He was rushed to the Sixteenth Shop Red Cross Nanshi Hospital for treatment. He was said to be severely poisoned and may be in danger.</p>

<p>Wu Junxuan Killed in the Line of Duty</p>
<p>Injured Robber Apprehended After Pursuit</p>
<p>Yesterday, just as dawn was breaking around 5 o'clock, a shooting occurred at the Jian Dao Qiao (Scissors Bridge) on Huining Road in the South City. A police officer on duty was shot and killed by robbers, and a stray bullet accidentally wounded one of the robber's companions. The detailed circumstances are recorded below. Wu Junxuan, from Tianjin, was 28 years old and a police officer at the Manufacturing Bureau Road police station of the Second District police department. He had only been on duty for six days. This morning, he was assigned to duty at the Jian Dao Qiao position on Huining Road. At dawn, he noticed three suspicious individuals traveling from east to west, talking amongst themselves and appearing fierce. Knowing they were not good people, he ordered them to stop. As he prepared to search them, the robbers, feigning innocence, took the initiative. Two robbers rushed forward and grabbed the officer’s arms, rendering him unable to resist or escape. Another robber drew a pistol from his sleeve and fired, firing five shots, two of which struck the officer. The bullets entered from the upper part of his chest, around the left and right nipples, and exited through his back, damaging his lungs. He immediately collapsed and died. A stray bullet wounded one of the robbers, named Jia (reportedly from Yancheng). The robbers scattered and fled in all directions. A nearby officer heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene. Seeing Jia and his companions running wildly, he knew what they had done and gave chase, pursuing them to the San Guan Tang area, where Jia was finally apprehended. The others escaped. Jia was taken to the Second District police department, where it was found that he was seriously injured. He was immediately sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Police were also dispatched to the scene of the incident, where they recovered five spent bullet casings from the ground. The local Baodi (local security) was ordered to report to the local court, requesting an inquest. Subsequently, a prosecutor arrived on the scene and confirmed that Officer Wu Junxuan had indeed died from gunshot wounds. The death certificate was issued, and instructions were given for the body to be collected and prepared for burial pending further instructions. It is reported that the officer's family, including his elderly mother, wife, and five-year-old son, were all dependent on him for support.</p>

<p>A Han Traitor Leads the Way, Motives Unknown</p>
<p>Police Surround the Factory Before They Disperse</p>
<p>Yesterday around 11:00 AM, three Japanese ruffians and a Chinese leader, traveling by car, suddenly intruded into the Liyuan Silk Factory in Xingxing Lane on Luban Road in the South City. The factory staff were terrified by their sudden arrival. Fortunately, a local police officer noticed them and immediately reported the incident to the responsible branch bureau. A number of police officers were quickly dispatched to surround the factory, and the Japanese ruffians then withdrew. At that time, nearby residents gathered outside to watch, causing the road to be blocked. The Liyuan Silk Factory, finding the incident peculiar, feared there might be other motives and reported it to the Second District General Bureau for investigation. According to the person in charge of the Liyuan Silk Factory, the Chinese leader was named Zhang Zhipeng and was from the same industry. The factory's report to the police station is recorded below: A report concerning the collusion of Japanese ruffians to disrupt the factory's operations, requesting a thorough investigation to facilitate business. Last year, due to sluggish business, our factory rented eight weaving machines to the Dongya Silk Factory. For the past four months, everything has been peaceful. Unexpectedly, Zhang Zhipeng, the person in charge of the sales office of the Dongya Silk Factory, suddenly led three Japanese ruffians to our factory today, arriving in a hurried and menacing manner. They arbitrarily harassed the factory, causing great fear and disruption among the staff. Although visitors are permitted to view the factory, Zhang Zhipeng of the Dongya Silk Factory did not notify our factory in advance or obtain our permission before leading people into the factory, especially since they were all Japanese. Their intentions are unknown. Therefore, we petition your office to promptly investigate the matter thoroughly for the sake of justice.</p>

The Pope's telegram has been printed and posted in various churches in the city and inland. Many people have signed up to participate recently. There are more than a dozen people from Beijing and Hankou who will join the Shanghai group at that time. Catholic adherents from other provinces are organizing their own groups nearby.

<h3 id="e140">Former Jiaxing County Magistrate Wang Ying Detained for Embezzling Public Funds <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Embezzled Public Funds of 90,000 Gold</p>
<p>Transfer Procedures Need to Be Corrected</p>
<p>The Qi-Lu Jiang-Zhe War is now nearly a decade old. During this war, the magistrates of various counties in Zhejiang, which fell into the war zone, mostly advanced and retreated with the army. Wang Ying, the magistrate of Jiaxing County, was one of them. Wang, whose courtesy name was Yueyuan, was from Xiuning, Anhui and had served in the Zhejiang political circles. He previously served in Zhuji, and later transferred to Jiahe. During the turmoil of the military affairs, he handed over his duties, but the handover was not fully settled. In recent years, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance has compiled a list of former county magistrates who had not fully settled their accounts, and submitted it to the provincial government, repeatedly notifying these individuals to settle their accounts within a specified period. Those who owed public funds were strictly ordered to expedite repayment. Wang Ying embezzled a huge sum of 90,000 gold in public funds during his tenure in Jiaxing. Although the Zhejiang provincial authorities ordered him to pay, Wang did not deal with it. The provincial government initially did not know his whereabouts, so they could not pursue the payment. Now, the detectives of the Zhejiang Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau have discovered that Wang Ying, since leaving office, has moved his family to 20 Xinjia Garden, Xinzha Road, in the Public</p>
<h3 id="e141">Strange Weather: Four Seasons in One Day <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The weather in this city has been unusually changeable recently, with temperature fluctuations of twenty or thirty degrees on the thermometer. Yesterday was especially so. The morning was exceptionally mild, and people on the streets felt warm wearing lined clothes and changed into single-layered clothing, as if it were summer. Unexpectedly, after lunch, the wind suddenly changed, and dark clouds gathered. First, it was a northwest wind, with sand blowing in the face on the streets. After 3:00 PM, it turned into a northeast wind, and it began to drizzle, followed by showers, but not very heavy, and it stopped soon after, like the scenery of spring and autumn. After nightfall, even lined clothes were not enough to keep warm, as if it were winter. In one day, there were four seasons.</p>
<p>Concession. They reported this to the bureau chief, stating that Wang had been wanted by provincial order and should be arrested and brought to justice to recover the public funds and deter corruption. Therefore, they prepared an official letter addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, requesting assistance in the arrest, and dispatched detectives to Shanghai to investigate and apprehend him. Because Wang resided in the area under the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road police station, the Concession authorities ordered the detectives to submit the letter to that police station yesterday morning, and they dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to assist in going to Wang's residence, where Wang Ying was arrested and detained at the police station. This morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Liu Yugui. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated that the Zhejiang province's request to transfer Wang Ying was flawed in many ways. For example, the letter to the police station should be addressed to the police department, as the Municipal Council of the Public Concession is only a part of the police department. Furthermore, if the province wishes to transfer him, in addition to providing evidence, they must also address a letter to the court requesting it. Both of these points are lacking, which is inconsistent with the agreement. Wang Ying has resided in the Concession for nine years and attention should be paid to this matter. Subsequently, Wang Ying's lawyer, Du Jimei, requested that Wang be released on bail. However, the official from the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Bureau stated that since the procedures were slightly flawed, they would correct them immediately. However, Wang Ying's embezzlement was well-documented, and he should still be detained. They would return to the superior authorities to gather all the evidence and prepare a formal letter before transferring him. Judge Liu then ordered Wang Ying to be detained pending the presentation of evidence and rescheduled the hearing for next Monday.</p>

<p>Niu Yongjian's First Test Drive</p>
<p>Since the construction of the Songhu Highway, all sections have been completed, except for the Wei Bridge on the Song (Songjiang) Wei (Weiqiao) section, which had not yet been completed. Therefore, automobiles and other vehicles traveling to Songjiang had to change vehicles at Weiqiao and could not pass directly. Later, the Liying company was given a deadline to rush construction, and it has now been completed. The Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company originally scheduled the official opening for the 15th of this month. The Vice President of the Examination Yuan, Niu Yongjian, went to Songjiang on business a few days ago. Upon hearing that the highway was open, he took his private car No. 1296 from Shanghai at 10:00 AM and drove directly to Songjiang. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, he returned to Shanghai in the same car. This was the first time that the Songwei Bridge was completed and the Songhu section was directly open to traffic.</p>

<p>The Work of Yu Zhongluo</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China, in order to revise the criminal code, resolved to organize a Criminal Procedure Code Revision Committee at a meeting on September 10, 1932. Various proposals were put forward, including the abolition of the prosecutor system and the lawyer interrogation system, as well as the jury system and other important issues. The committee held repeated research meetings, and unanimously recommended that Committee Member Yu Zhenluo be responsible for drafting the main draft. After spending several days, a lengthy draft has now been prepared, consisting of tens of thousands of words. It is currently being printed in two volumes and will be distributed to various committee members within a few days to collect opinions, and then submitted to the judicial authorities for adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Citizens' Association Requests that French Authorities Stop Collecting Repair Fees for Bicycles <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Because they opposed the French Municipal Council's levy of a three tael per quarter repair fee, which they could not afford, the French Concession's bicycle rental industry unanimously expressed their opposition, resulting in the French Municipal Council cutting off the water and electricity to more than ten businesses in the industry. At the same time, more than 40 businesses in the French Concession were forced to close down since the day before yesterday. This was reported yesterday. Now, the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' United Association has sent a letter to the United Association yesterday regarding this matter, requesting negotiations. The original letter is recorded below: "To the respected Association, according to a letter from the association members Lao Fei Dian, Xi Aifu, Hongji, Fei Dian, Xiafei, Jinji, Fei Yun, and Li Xingchang bicycle shops, our establishments have been renting bicycles in the French Concession for many years. In addition to paying the police tax, we have also recently paid for a classified business license. Since we have been in business, there have been no accidents. Unexpectedly, the French Municipal Council recently issued a new repair license for our industry, which requires a quarterly payment of three taels of silver. This has been implemented since March of this year. We have already paid the municipal tax and the business tax, which we already find difficult to bear. Moreover, our businesses are all small-scale operations, and the profits are extremely small. The so-called repair is not a factory specializing in hiring workers to repair, but only sporadic parts configuration. However, the French Municipal Council is taking this opportunity to levy a tax, which is truly unbearable. Therefore, we unanimously expressed our refusal. Unexpectedly, the French Municipal Council saw that our industry opposed it and used coercive means, stopping the water and electricity supply since the day before yesterday, resulting in the closure of more than a dozen businesses. We have checked the business license that has been issued to our industry, and the regulations have been specified in detail. No additional taxes should be levied to increase the burden. We have requested cancellation, but why are we being oppressed? Our more than 40 businesses are in this</p>

<p>| Official Notification Re: Municipal No. 6831, Concession No. 4729 |</p>
<p>A black canvas-covered truck of the Isakes brand, municipal license No. 6831 and concession license No. 4729, was discovered unmanned at the Dinghai Temple, located about one li from the seawall automobile station on the Huhu Hang Highway, on the first of this month. The Haiyan County Government, after receiving the report, pushed the vehicle to Tianning Temple for temporary storage and sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting clarification and a reply. The Municipal Government immediately ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to investigate and reply in detail for verification and transfer.</p>
<p>situation, and we have no choice but to painfully suspend business from yesterday. We believe that your association is a group of citizens, and the purpose is to protect the safety of businesses. Therefore, we are submitting this letter jointly, requesting your assistance in negotiating a stop to this so that we can operate safely and ease the burden. We anxiously await your orders," they say. In view of this, since the industry has already paid for a business license, it is not appropriate to impose a special tax to increase the burden. Moreover, since the January 28th incident last year, the city's businesses have been declining and have not yet recovered. The bureau should sympathize with the merchants' difficulties and promote the city's economy. Now, they are levying a special tax, forcing the industry to bear the burden. This is truly an oppressive tax that disturbs the people. It is reasonable to submit this to your association and request that you quickly find a way to stop it, so that the merchants of Jiangsu can be relieved of their difficulties."</p>

<p>| An Urgent Announcement from the Telephone Bureau |</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been several cases of telephone users in Zhabei being defrauded by criminals posing as telephone bureau employees or workers, falsely claiming to be checking the electrical meter or making repairs, and stealing telephone sets or parts. The Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the National Government Ministry of Communications has investigated and issued an urgent notice to all users: "Re: Urgent notice. It has been found that the technicians of this bureau wear the bureau's uniform and service badges when working outside. Those who go to users' homes to work are also dispatched with work orders signed by the engineers. The precautions are extremely thorough. However, there are unscrupulous people who dare to impersonate the technicians of this bureau and fraudulently dismantle telephones from users in the Zhabei district. This is extremely audacious. In addition to strict investigation, we hereby issue an urgent notice, hoping that you will pay attention at all times. If any parts are fraudulently taken, the user will be responsible for compensation. Please do not be foolish and misled."</p>

<p>Chinese Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to the Municipal Council for Investigation</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession of this city has sent a letter to the Municipal Council for investigation because a Western police officer used intimidation and shouting to collect police tax from tenants, in order to protect the rights of taxpayers. It stated, "To the respected Directors, according to a letter from Wang Yongkang, 'I rented a Western-style house in Taihe Village, Weihaiwei Road, which belongs to the Xielong Real Estate Company, on March 1st of this year and moved in on the 9th of this month. The Municipal Council sent someone to collect the police tax for one month in March and gave me a receipt as proof. Unexpectedly, on the 24th of this month, a tax collector named H.J. Chlitensren came and insisted on collecting the police tax for January and February. I replied that I had not moved in in January and February, and that I should not pay the police tax for those months. However, he could not understand and made a loud noise. My neighbors told him the address of the previous tenant, and he left. This morning, because I was unwell, I was resting quietly when the Westerner came again and shouted incessantly, and even threatened the women, saying that if they did not pay, they would be arrested, etc. Therefore, I got up and argued with him, and he left reluctantly. Citizens pay taxes in order to seek the protection of the police force and to have security. Now, this Westerner, as a public official, disregards the law and intrudes into the homes of safe and tax-paying people and shouts loudly. Is this the right that taxpayers should have? Therefore, I am reporting this to your association, hoping that you will inform the Municipal Council and reprimand such public officials. If they are not severely punished, I am afraid that I am not the only one who will be harassed by them.' It has been reported to the Association. If the behavior of the Western tax collector is true, he should be punished. If there is no proof that Mr. Wang did not live there from March 9th, then collecting the police tax for January and February is an illegal act. According to the letter, we respectfully request that your Bureau quickly order the relevant department to investigate and take action."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Meida Neirong Store's Failure to Distribute Dividends Leads to Lawsuit <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>| Chen Jianbai Sued by Shareholders |</p>
<p>Chen Jianbai, a shareholder of the Meida Neirong Store at the Huajin Lane entrance on Fuzhou Road, was sued because he failed to publicly distribute the profits accumulated over the years. This led to questioning by his maternal uncle, Bai Puxi, which resulted in a dispute. Although mediation was attempted, Chen overturned the original agreement, so the reconciliation failed. Chen's widowed sister-in-law learned of this and, following Bai's example, demanded a share of the profits. She hired a lawyer and filed a complaint with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the accounts of Meida and its affiliated company, Meihua, be sealed and preserved, and that further lawsuits be allowed. This was previously reported. It is said that Meida was established in the summer of the first year of the Republic (1912), and the original founders were Chen Ruixiang, Bai Puxi, Ye Shaowu, Ying Zijun, and others. Chen and Bai were uncle and brother-in-law. Chen invested 4,000 yuan, and Bai invested 1,000 yuan. Ye, Ying, and other shareholders invested about 8,000 or 9,000 yuan, bringing the total to 13,000 yuan. At that time, they specialized in military uniforms. However, before long, Ye, Ying, and others withdrew their shares one after another, and the business was run by Chen and Bai. Bai was in charge of internal affairs, and Chen was solely responsible for external affairs. They divided the work and cooperated, and the business grew daily. They then established the affiliated company Meihua. From then on, Chen and Bai each managed one store. In the 19th year (1930), Chen died of illness, and the management of Meida, which he left behind, was taken over by his son, Chen Jianbai. Since then, the accounts have never been made public, and no dividends have been distributed. It was not until last winter that Bai Puxi demanded to see the accounts. Chen also knew that he was in the wrong and asked relatives and friends to mediate, deciding to convert the goods in the store into cash at the actual price and hand over the profit accounts for the past years for distribution. Unexpectedly, Chen went back on his word, and the reconciliation was halted. Chen's deceased brother's wife then followed Bai's example. Now that the court has granted her request to seal the account books, she has taken a further step by having her representative lawyer formally file a lawsuit against Chen.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Bao Inspector Embezzles Red Pills, Then Dares to Entrust Others to Sell Them for Profit <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Fan Chongxin from Haimen, currently 27 years old, was found on the morning of the 31st of last month at 4:30 AM, carrying 100 silver dollars and 190 paper bills, totaling 290 dollars, alone, walking through the intersection of Route Cardinal Foch and Rue Amiral Bayle in the French Concession. He was spotted by Vietnamese constable No. 167 and two Chinese constables, Nos. 34 and 49, who found his behavior suspicious. They approached, searched him, and found a large sum of money, two ledgers for selling red pills, and a business card of Wang Fusheng, a bao inspector of the French Concession police. When asked where he was coming from, Fan stammered in reply. He was immediately taken to the police station for interrogation. Fan confessed that he was an apprentice and associate of Wang Fusheng, bao inspector No. 148. The money was given to him by Dong Shenshi, the landlady of Dafang Inn No. 20 on Min’guo Road, to be delivered to Wang Fusheng's house at No. 782 on Rue Massenet, and that it was money from selling red pills. The police chief sent detective Zhang Fengming to Dafang Inn to inquire with Dong Shenshi. She stated that she knew Wang Fusheng, but did not know Fan Chongxin, nor had she given Fan any money to deliver to Wang Fusheng. They then inquired with Wang Fusheng, who also claimed not to know Fan, that he was neither his apprentice nor his associate, and that if he committed a crime, he could be dealt with according to official procedures. Detective Zhang, finding no leads, returned to the police station and questioned Fan, who maintained his previous statement. Therefore, Zhang went again to inquire with Dong Shenshi. She then admitted that she had given Fan Chongxin 290 dollars to deliver to Wang Fusheng, but that it was not money from selling red pills. When asked why she had denied it the first time, she claimed that she had forgotten due to being busy. They then inquired with Wang Fusheng again, and Wang also claimed that it was money from a rotating credit association. Zhang immediately reported this information to the Western detective chief, believing that Wang and Dong were indeed suspected of selling narcotics. Wang and Dong were detained. The next day, they were brought to the Second Special District Court for interrogation along with Fan. Wang was ordered to pay 500 dollars in bail, while Fan and Dong were remanded in custody pending investigation. The police have now discovered that Wang Fusheng, bao inspector No. 148, when sent to guard the red pill manufacturing facility broken up on Rue Lafayette near Qianjiatang on March 11th, had actually given some of the red pills to his associate (i.e., Fan Chongxin) to transport out and entrusted them to Dong Shenshi for sale. Zheng Renjun, the coachman of a certain bao inspector who was also guarding the facility at the time, witnessed this. Therefore, yesterday, the witness Zheng Renjun was summoned, and the defendants were brought back to the court. Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the criminal court. First, the police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the circumstances of the defendants' arrest and the police investigation, and stated that the police were now prosecuting the third defendant, Wang Fusheng, under Article 357 of the Criminal Code for embezzling items held in official capacity, and the first and second defendants, Fan Chongxin and Dong Shenshi, under Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Law for selling opium substitutes, requesting that they be severely punished according to the law. The evidence, including the cash and ledgers, was presented to the court. The court ordered the defendants to be interrogated separately. Fan Chongxin was interrogated first. He stated that he had known Dong Shenshi for over two months, and had met Wang Fusheng more than a month ago when Wang's child had a full-month celebration and invited him for drinks. The business card on the case was the one used to invite him for drinks. Dong Shenshi had instructed him to deliver the money to Wang Fusheng, saying that it was money from a rotating credit association, and that it was not for selling red pills. Dong Shenshi and Wang Fusheng were then interrogated. Both stated that the money was from a rotating credit association, which had started on the tenth day of the first month of the lunar new year in the year before last, and had dissolved in April of last year due to the war, totaling 48 shares, with 29 installments already paid. They adamantly denied selling red pills. At this point, the court ordered the witness Zheng Renjun to be brought in. According to his testimony, on the evening of March 11th, he drove his boss Zhou Buqui to the red pill facility to guard it. Wang Fusheng later slept in the back room of the living room. In the middle of the night, Wang's associate came and knocked on the door, and after entering, slept with him. The next morning, the associate went upstairs, and he followed him, seeing him grab the red pills from a wheat flour bag and fill two or three of his pockets before leaving. The judge asked if Wang's associate was the first defendant, Fan Chongxin. Zheng turned and examined Fan's face, answering that it was him, Wang's associate. The defense then presented Mi Baoshan, the person in charge of the rotating credit association, who testified about the circumstances of each lottery draw. The court then ordered both witnesses to sign affidavits and then ordered the start of the debate. First, the police lawyer debated, and then the defendants were defended by four lawyers, including Jiang Yiping and Chen Zhigao. The court then declared the debate closed and adjourned the court for a future sentencing.</p>

<p>丨Fine of 300 Dollars丨</p>
<p>Xia Jinfu, a shareholder and manager of Guanglu Automobile Company located at No. 60 on Route Paul Beau in the French Concession, was driving a company car with license plate No. 11118 at 4:40 PM on the 15th of last month when he struck and killed Gao Shugen, a tailor, in front of the Zhuangyuanlou restaurant on Rue de la Sœur. The traffic department sent Xia to the Second Special District Court, where he was publicly prosecuted under Article 291 of the Criminal Code for causing death by negligence and Article 7 of the Traffic Regulations for violating traffic regulations. The family of the deceased, represented by lawyer Wang Shizong, filed an incidental private prosecution, seeking compensation of 4,100 dollars. After repeated court hearings, the trial concluded yesterday with Judge Wang Wangxu finding Xia Quanfu guilty of causing death by negligence and fining him 300 dollars. It is reported that the defendant has engaged a mediator to reach a settlement with the family of the deceased, paying 750 dollars.</p>

<p>丨丨Should Be Made to the Original Trial Court丨丨</p>
<p>Guo Weiyi, a Cantonese who is the chairman and manager of the Guohua Soda Factory, was previously sued in the Second Special District Court by Lin Yayue, a woman from the same hometown, who filed a criminal private prosecution alleging that when she was fostered at Guo's house ten years ago, she was raped by Guo in the bathroom and then continuously for four years, until Guo's wife found out and forced her to return to her hometown, after which she was abandoned and ignored. She requested an investigation. Guo also filed a countersuit against Lin for false accusation. The details of the interrogation have been reported previously. Subsequently, the court ruled that both claims were unfounded. It is now learned that Guo, dissatisfied with the original verdict, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court a few days ago. The appeal has now been rejected, stating that appeals in criminal cases should be made to the original trial court, as stipulated by the Criminal Procedure Law. Directly filing an appeal is not in accordance with the law, and the original document has been sent to the original trial court for review and processing.</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Absurd Behavior of a Fortune Teller <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>丨Seducing and Raping···Being Beaten···Informant···Drowning Attempt丨</p>
<p>Chou Fengwu, a 31-year-old man from Yancheng, makes a living as a fortune teller, traveling around various places all year round (commonly known as "opening a pier") and residing in no fixed address. A few years ago, he had some savings from working outside, so he took a boat back to his hometown, intending to relax for a while before going out again to pursue his old profession. Xia Qilou, a fellow villager not far from his home, had only two or three acres of poor land, which he and his wife, Fu (named Xiuying), cultivated to make a living. Due to years of famine, the harvest from the fields was poor, making it difficult to survive and causing extreme hardship. Xia was forced to abandon his life as a farmer and go to Shanghai to seek a different livelihood, while Fu guarded the house alone, often facing the risk of running out of food. Chou had known Fu for a long time and, seeing her plight, provided her with financial assistance. Fu, seeing that her husband had been away for a long time without any news, and in addition to Chou's financial help, he also expressed his deep affection for her, leading to a love affair and cohabitation. Xia in Shanghai was unaware of this. Last year, Fu became pregnant. Coincidentally, her husband returned home in the autumn and, seeing his wife's swollen abdomen, became suspicious. He thought to himself that he had been separated from his wife for more than a year, so how could she be pregnant? After several interrogations and inquiries, he finally learned that Fu had been cohabiting with Chou Fengwu for a long time. He was filled with uncontrollable anger and repeatedly punched Chou. However, Chou and Fu were deeply in love and felt a great reluctance to part. Taking advantage of Xia's absence, they secretly trysted from time to time. When Xia found out, he dragged the adulterous couple to court that winter. The result of the trial was that both were sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Xia, seeing that his wife was six months pregnant and about to give birth, pleaded with the court to allow him to take her back under his supervision. Xia then moved his entire family to Shanghai, residing on a small boat owned by his father-in-law, Fu Hengyou, located south of the Outer Rihui Port Railway in this city, in order to sever Fu's ties with Chou. However, Chou, who had been released from prison this spring, learned that Fu had moved to Shanghai with her husband. With his infatuation undiminished, he still tracked her down to Shanghai. Upon learning that Fu had given birth to a son nearly three months ago, he believed that the child was his own and was determined to see his face to fulfill his paternal affection. Recently, carrying his fortune-telling paper rolls and other items, he mustered the courage to barge into Fu's residence, where he was met by Xia and beaten severely again. Chou staggered back home, harboring grievances he could not express, leading him to contemplate ending his life. The day before yesterday, after drafting a complaint and a statement, he boarded a ferry at the Hongkou Port pier at around 5 PM, heading towards Pudong. When he reached the middle of the river, Chou left behind his characters, brush, inkstone, and other belongings, along with the complaint and statement, and then jumped into the river to commit suicide. After his body sank, it suddenly surfaced again and was rescued by the crew, along with his belongings. He was taken to the Second Squad of the Pudong Police, and then transferred to the Third District. After questioning him, District Chief Zhang found his written complaint to be very comical, filled with complaints. It included phrases such as "having spent over 200 dollars on Ying (referring to Fu)" and ended by requesting the Director of the Huangpu River Water Police Bureau to arrest Xia Qilou, whom he called the defendant, and send him to the Shanghai Local Court for punishment. As for the statement, it described the general course of events and stated that he had not served the country by fighting the Eastern dwarfs when he had money, so what face did he have to see the elders of his hometown? He could only hope to be a patriotic general in the next life and destroy the Japanese. After ordering that he be given dry clothes to change into, the district chief ordered that he be handed over to the General Bureau for disposal.</p>

<p>Opening of Zheng Renshan's Finger Painting Exhibition Mr. Zheng Renshan, also known as Jianglang Shanren, is a famous artist from Zhejiang. He is proficient in bronze and stone seal engraving, especially finger painting. Landscapes, plum blossoms, and rocks all deeply capture the essence of the six principles of painting. In the past three hundred years, only Gao Qipei has been a famous finger painter. Using fingers to depict the changes of smoke and clouds is even more difficult than using a brush. Now Mr. Zheng has selected one hundred fine finger paintings from his usual works and brought them to Shanghai for exhibition, opening a new era for finger painting exhibitions in Shanghai. The venue is the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road. It is reported that many people have gone to visit in recent days and are very excited.</p>

Children have weak internal organs, and even a slight carelessness can lead to a variety of diseases. Therefore, many children inside and outside the city are suffering from fever, cough, rapid breathing, and phlegm, as well as measles all over their bodies, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The transmission is very rapid, which is quite dangerous.

<h3 id="e161">Further Discussion on "Can We Return to the Countryside?" <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. You Huaigao of the Free Farm on Connaught Road, This Municipality丨</p>
<p>I am a staunch advocate for returning to the countryside and building it up. So, the other day, when I saw the question, "Can We Return to the Countryside?" I was very happy to offer an answer to Shen Bao and a plan for Mr. Xiongsheng. I haven't heard back from Mr. Xiongsheng, but I saw a letter from Mr. Liu Siming refuting me. I admire his enthusiasm and appreciate his concern. I not only want to advise Mr. Xiongsheng, who is interested in returning to the countryside, to go and build it up, but I also urge all college and university students across the country to spend a year after graduation helping the nation build up the countryside. This article has been published in Shen Bao for fifteen consecutive days. I wonder if Mr. Liu has read it? If not, I have a separate print here for you, so Mr. Liu can understand that I am not a "capitalist." Therefore, I not only want to "try," but also to "implement." I not only want to implement it myself, but I also advocate that everyone implement it. Because "trying" means acting hastily without sufficient experience. If the trial goes badly, you have to come back. "Implementing" means that you have studied it thoroughly and are sure of success, and then you implement it. You proceed resolutely, aiming for success. I studied agriculture, practice agriculture, and have not left my agricultural profession for fourteen years. I have personally seen farms in England, America, France, Germany, and Russia. I have interacted with several foreign farm children as classmates. I have spent several months interning in foreign villages. In the more than ten years since returning to China, I have also been to many villages. I have read many books and newspapers about the Chinese countryside. Witnessing the suffering of the farmers, what pains me the most is that the farmers have no education generation after generation. If they had education, there would not be endless natural and man-made disasters, and they would not be so helpless in the current situation. To implement my plan, I must start with cultivating talent. Therefore, I am establishing an institution in Longhua New Field to train rural teachers and agricultural and industrial leaders, which will be established in the autumn. I will also set up several village elementary schools in my hometown of Suzhou. Recently, I have also funded a person to set up a village elementary school in Chen Geng Village, Beixinjing. This is not "trying," but "implementing." In my personal opinion, China's greatest enemy at present is not only the problem of Japanese aggression, but also the ignorance of tens of millions of farmers. Overcoming this ignorance is probably a hundred times more difficult than defeating Japan. If we had education, even if only one percent of farmers resisted Japan, one percent of farmers served as reserves, and one percent of farmers provided supplies, Japan would probably not dare to be so barbaric. The words I dislike the most are saying that people are idealistic and fantasizing. Because these are the words of people who have no ambition, no courage, little knowledge, and a lack of perseverance! Water, fire, and the sky can still be conquered, so how can we not dare to enter the countryside where our food and clothing come from? May Mr. Liu remember the two sentences "The ideal is the mother of fact" and "Failure is the opportunity for success." Unfortunately, most people have no ideals, so there are few facts! Although China currently lacks a paradise, provinces like Hunan, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Zhejiang are making great progress in various constructions. (Please refer to the National Education Social Expenditure Statistics Table). China is sixteen times larger than Japan, so the temporary occupation of the three northeastern provinces by Japan and the perennial banditry in Jiangxi do not mean the rest of the provinces are not peaceful and prosperous. Many people such as An Lu Zhong'an, Fang Renlin, Hu Shuyi, Fan Shouyuan, and Ye Guohun are responsible for guidance, and the department's service hours are from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day, located at Nos. 405-406, Silk Industry Building, Shilukou, Sanma Road.</p>

<p>Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: The Shandong coast is cloudy, with rain or heavy fog. The wind is tight and comes from the northwest to north. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are overcast, gradually becoming cloudy, with heavy fog or thunderstorms. The wind is increasing and directionless. The coastal area south of Ma'an Island is cloudy, with heavy fog and southeast winds. The air pressure in southwestern China is decreasing. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city was a high of 81.9 and a low of 60.3. On the same day last year, the high was 52.3 and the low was 42.8.</p>
<p>So I still urge Mr. Xiongsheng to work hard to build his Utopia. I do not advocate Mr. Liu's idea of stopping work to resist Japan and sitting and waiting for victory. My new-style Utopia is a rural standard. Because what is lacking in the countryside is literate and eloquent leaders, so my idea is that urban patriots and people of virtue should go to the countryside to lead farmers to transform and build, and to relieve their suffering. It is definitely not "escaping from the world!" It is "entering the world." Because Mr. Xiongsheng has no place in the city, I advise him to leave the world of the city and enter the world of the countryside. It is completely different from Meng Haoran's seeking plum blossoms in the snow and Tao Yuanming's drinking wine and appreciating chrysanthemums. The new-style Utopia is a village with convenient transportation, scientific production, education, emphasis on hygiene, beauty, and purity. In France in the mid-18th century, there was a model village pastor named Oberlin. He was just as impoverished as Mr. Xiongsheng. He practiced preaching and teaching in the area between Germany, France, and Switzerland, which had long been ravaged by soldiers and bandits and where people's livelihoods were declining. His money was also begged and borrowed, and his food was bread, water, and salt. Through his lifelong efforts, he created his Utopia. There was also a great sacrificer from Belgium named Damiew, who went alone to the most prevalent place of leprosy in the South Pacific Islands to preach and help patients. Sixteen years later, he himself was infected with the disease. Because of his sacrifice, later people actually eliminated leprosy in this place. This righteous man also created his imagined Utopia. I am not a Christian, but I admire their spirit very much. The prosperity of villages in various countries is due to education, and the development and success of education is still due to the willingness of scholars and people of virtue to sacrifice. So I still want to ask Mr. Liu to change his thinking from now on, to be positive and optimistic, and to work hard to advance! The current panic in the United States is because the special markets during and after the European war stimulated the rise of agriculture and industry throughout the United States. When the market changed later, the situation of overproduction today arose. The President is now issuing 200 million yuan in bonds to lend to farmers, and it will soon return to its original state, which is by no means the same as our country's poor countryside. Therefore, Mr. Liu's blaming rural education is completely and fundamentally wrong. American farmers have 120 million yuan in debt, but they still have tens of millions of yuan worth of farmland, houses, cattle, sheep, machinery, and piles of agricultural products. They are just temporarily unable to turn around, not really empty. So please don't worry about American farmers, you still have to design for our country's poor farmers. If Mr. Xiongsheng goes to the countryside, I will indeed help Mr. Xiongsheng solve his personal life, and at the same time, I also hope that Mr. Xiongsheng will do some work in the countryside that will benefit the country and the people. This is the original intention of my publishing "Can We Return to the Countryside?" I hope Mr. Liu will not recognize me as an idealist who likes to sing high tunes, show off, trick people into traps, and enjoy myself. Mr. Liu also said that most of the upper class are snobbish and greedy, while shop assistants and workers are honest and truthful, which is inevitably somewhat arbitrary. You must know that good, evil, wisdom, and stupidity exist everywhere, and you must never use poverty, lowliness, wealth, and nobility as the standard. I said that villagers are relatively honest, which is relative, not absolute. Finally, I still want to hear Mr. Liu's opinion on the "Can We Return to the Countryside?" question raised by Mr. Xiongsheng.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding the question "Can We Return to the Countryside?" since Mr. You Huaigao of the Free Farm in this city wrote a letter to participate in the discussion, Mr. Liu Simin of this city wrote a letter expressing his opposition (see this column on the 5th and 7th). Now we have received another letter from Mr. You Huaigao, explaining Mr. Liu Simin's questions and listing the reasons for his advocacy of rural education to save the country, which is of great research value. Mr. You also hopes that Mr. Liu will continue to discuss it. Mr. Liu must still have high opinions to express, and we will wait for them.</p>

<p>Urging various schools to organize student unions</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Reschedules Meeting for Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai University Student Union, in order to urge various schools to organize student unions so as to establish the University Student Union as soon as possible and enrich the strength of young people to resist insults and save the country, specially issued an organizational declaration yesterday to inform all students in Shanghai, and scheduled a second preparatory meeting at the Youth Propaganda Team tomorrow (Sunday) at 2:00 PM to discuss all important proposals. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Declaration: Today, when internal and external troubles are tormenting each other, the survival of our nation has indeed reached the most critical and serious stage, and the judgment of whether the national destiny will be cut off in the future still depends on the final efforts of all the people. We young students are usually praised as the backbone of society and encouraged to be the pillars of the country. At this time when the disaster of subjugation is imminent, if we do not rise up and be the vanguard of the people, we will not only fail to live up to the expectations of society for young people, but also betray the responsibilities that young people should fulfill for the country. However, the country today is full of dangers, and it is not possible to save this ancient country full of holes and sores in one fell swoop, nor is it enough to sit down and make declarations and just vent "anger." We must persist in fighting and never slacken, and everyone should work from their own positions, taking it as their responsibility to prepare for the enrichment of "strength," so that the country's future can be saved. To achieve this goal, it is impossible to succeed without organizing steps and a sound organization. In view of this, this association initiated the preparation of the "Shanghai University Student Union" so that we can take the same steps and share the same goal, with the spirit of perseverance and hard work, and carry out long-term and effective struggle. It is hoped that all universities in Shanghai, those that have already organized will join this association as soon as possible, and those that have not organized will prepare at an accelerated pace, so that the strength is concentrated and the actions are consistent. The organization of a sound youth group can consolidate the line of defense against insults and save the country. When disaster is at hand, there is no room for hesitation. We hope that all the students of all universities in Shanghai will learn from this together.</p>
<p>Convening of the Preparatory Committee: The second preparatory committee of the association was originally scheduled to be held this afternoon, but due to the problem of the meeting place not being properly contacted, it has been rescheduled to be held tomorrow (Sunday) at 2:00 PM at the Youth Propaganda Team of Xiaoshimen to discuss important issues. Rescheduling notices have been sent out separately.</p>

<p>The Central Army Military Academy is recruiting enlistees for the tenth term. Previously, considering that the education and culture of Mongolia and Tibet were relatively backward compared to the mainland, the request of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was specially approved to lower the examination qualifications for Mongolian and Tibetan students. It is now learned that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent a letter based on the request of overseas Chinese students Zhou Longsen and others, requesting the school to follow the example of Mongolian and Tibetan students and approve the reduction of examination qualifications. This has now been approved by the General Training Department and sent to the Shanghai Central Government for investigation. The Municipal Government specially ordered the Public Security and Education Bureaus yesterday to investigate and handle it.</p>

<p>Crowds of Visitors Postpone the Conference for One Day</p>
<p>Today is the 37th Anniversary Ceremony</p>
<p>Yesterday was the ninth day of the opening of the National Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition. At 10:00 AM, there was a slide show lecture.

<p>The conference was postponed. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a joint meeting of the directors of each group of the Industrial and Railway Exhibition was held in Rong Hong Hall, chaired by Li Zhaohuan. Many cases were discussed and decided. The main points are published below: (1) Since the opening of this exhibition, tens of thousands of people from all walks of life have visited the conference every day. The various factories and people from outside the conference have successively sent letters requesting that the conference be extended for one or two days to popularize it. It was unanimously approved to extend it for one day until 7:00 PM on April 9 (Sunday). Our school will resume classes on the 11th. (2) The faculty and staff dinner was originally scheduled for 12:00 noon on the 8th, but it has now been changed to 7:00 PM on the 9th in Wenzhi Hall. Gather at the Da Caochang at 9:00 AM that morning to take a group photo to commemorate it. (3) The 37th anniversary celebration of the university's founding will be held in Wenzhi Hall at 10:00 AM on the 8th.

<p>Two-Way Model: In the Chen Lieshi Room of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, there is a two-way model covering hundreds of square feet, with stations and lines of various colors. The small train placed in it can also run automatically. The mountains, rivers, terrain, and important products along the way are marked with real objects. The layout is novel and the design is sophisticated. Viewers lingered and were reluctant to leave. Also, the conference's small railway bureau has been offering free rides to children under the age of ten since Children's Day on April 4th. As a result, there are more passengers than before, and the business is very prosperous.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Academic Lectures <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>At the academic lectures the night before last, Xu Mingcai first introduced the brief biographies of Zhou Zijing and Zhu Maocheng in the first classroom of the Engineering Hall. Then Mr. Zhou gave a lecture on "Report on the Observation of Industry in Shaanxi." Although the speech was recorded, it was requested not to be published. After the lecture, a live-action film was shown, which was taken by Mr. Zhou when he traveled to Shaanxi. It briefly covered the living conditions of the people of Shaanxi, the transportation situation, and the ancient scenic spots and historical sites, which gave us, who live in the blessed land of Jiangnan, a deep impression. Then Zhu Maocheng gave a lecture on "Observations on the Recent World Economic Situation." The insightful remarks stated that the manpower of the entire China is only equivalent to the hydropower generators of thirteen or fourteen frames, showing the weakness of China's national strength. He also used the hat-making industry to describe the reasons for world unemployment. Both solemn and humorous, it was thought-provoking. Mr. Zhou's film used a microscope to observe the situation in Shaanxi, and listening to Mr. Zhu's speech was like looking at European and American countries with a telescope. In a few words, more than 300 listeners were moved.</p>

<p>Defeats Nie Kaoer and Advances to the Second Week</p>
<p>Result: 1000 Points to 546 Points</p>
<p>In the first week of the Shanghai Amateur First Division Pellet Gun Competition, our country's Pellet Gun King Li Gongying showed his true colors yesterday, defeating Nie Kaoer with 1000 points to 546 points. Mr. Li once held hegemony over Shanghai two years ago, but in the previous two sessions, he was defeated by Mei Dina. Mr. Li's ambition to avenge himself and win the championship remains the same as before. Yesterday's opponent was too weak, and his victory was as easy as turning his hand. From now on, he advances to the second week, and his future is limitless. During the first ten shots or so, Nie Kaoer also briefly ranked above Mr. Li. However, the good times did not last long, and he was soon left behind, with no chance of turning the tables. In the first half, Mr. Li led with 500 points to 291. In the second half, Mr. Li scored almost every shot, with a maximum score of 74, and scored above 11 points many times. Compared with his past performance, this is not his best record. Nie Kaoer's technique was very steady, and under pressure, he remained calm and composed, fighting as usual. His defeat was not due to lack of effort, but due to insufficient strength.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>This joke was heard at a banquet. One Miss Yi, who is admirable, simply delivered a blow to those stuck in unrequited love.</p>
<p>Miss Yi was returning home from school. She took the ferry at the pier outside Xumen, paying a copper coin to get to the other side, which shortened the journey considerably. That day, a young man was standing on the bow of the boat, and intoxicated by her beauty, he stared at her without blinking. This was extremely dangerous! Suddenly, a small steamboat emerged from the arch of Wanniang Bridge, and the once calm river surface was instantly stirred into rough waves! The young man standing on the bow lost his footing and was about to fall into the heart of the waves when a jade-like arm suddenly reached out and held him tightly. He was saved from falling into the water with a splash.</p>
<p>After landing, the young man tearfully thanked her for saving his life. She only smiled slightly and left in haste. Later, the young man hoped to meet Miss Yi again, but he heard that she had transferred to a school in Hangzhou and there was no chance of seeing her again. The young man was already married, but his wife was not as beautiful as Miss Yi. Therefore, he longed for her beautiful face day and night, and became a lovesick wretch! The cure for lovesickness was only to meet Miss Yi, and if she did not come, he would wither away and die! The young man's mother and wife were filled with endless worry. They heard that Miss Yi was returning home for spring break, so they went to her door to beg her to visit the patient. Just her willingness to come and see the patient would greatly improve his condition.</p>
<p>Miss Yi, feeling a sense of compassion, actually came to visit the patient. With each visit, his illness lessened. On the third visit, the young man was already able to get out of bed. Miss Yi said, "I will come again in three days to inquire about his condition. When I come, I will personally cook some delicacies to help the patient regain his appetite." When the young man heard this, he was moved to tears again.</p>
<p>Three days later, Miss Yi, as beautiful as a goddess, came. The delicacies she had cooked were braised ham hocks, one red and one white, commonly known as Golden and Silver Ham Hocks. The young man had a high appetite, and with the "gift from a beautiful woman," he could of course eat heartily and greedily. However, she wanted the young man to distinguish the taste of the two ham hocks. First, she had him close his eyes tightly, and then she gave him some of the golden ham hock and asked, "How does it taste?" The young man said, "Very good." Then she gave him some of the silver ham hock and asked, "What about this?" The young man said, "Also very good." She asked him tightly, "Are there two different tastes?" The man replied, "Just one taste."</p>
<p>Suddenly, her delicate jade-like hand delivered a palm strike to his face! Then, in a clear, oriole-like voice, she scolded, "Since you know that the ham hocks don't have two different tastes, how can a woman have two different tastes?" With that, she left without looking back.</p>
<p>At that moment, the young man's face turned dark and pale, almost like the golden and silver ham hocks. His lovesickness was cured from then on. The cure for lovesickness only required a single dose of prickly pear.</p>
<p>The characters in the play include elegant young masters, flower-like young ladies and wives, merchants, lawyers, prostitutes, stars, beggars, poets, students, movie queens, generals, gentlemen, and hooligans...</p>
<p>Recent performances include patriotic fervor and grief in the face of national crisis, the passionate rush to save the country, tearful love, and the twisted, bizarre, and ugly aspects of seduction, abandonment, rape, and debauchery. There are...</p>
<p>Before the world is destroyed and the cities collapse, this grand theater will continue to present its creations.</p>

<p>— Jian Chonglou</p>
<p>I have not tasted the experience of a wedding, whether old or new.</p>
<p>But whenever I watch relatives and friends hold weddings, I always see the same routine; "The bride and groom stand awkwardly in the middle of the hall, as if waiting for legal judgment. Then, the officiant delivers a long speech about the talented man and beautiful woman being a perfect match, followed by the marriage host saying a few polite words of forgiveness. Then, the guests who are good at speaking deliver speeches, and in front of the men and women, they say inappropriate things like 'working hard' and 'intensifying the production of citizens.' Then, the guests laugh as if they are watching a Charlie Chaplin film! Finally, the bride and groom bow to express their gratitude, and this embarrassing wedding comes to an end."</p>
<h3 id="e198">The MSG of Life <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>What is the meaning and flavor of people living in this world? This "mystery" is probably solved thoroughly by very few. Do we live to eat? Animals also do that. Do we live to reproduce? Animals also know how to mate. Do we live for wealth and status? In the end, very few achieve their goals! Even if they do achieve their goals, the wealthy are probably more worried than the poor. Do we live for money? A person cannot live forever, and no amount of money can buy a fence on the ocean floor. Tao Yuanming said it well, "Life is not a hundred years, yet we harbor a thousand years of worry." This is the point. So, is life without any "meaning" or "flavor?"</p>
<p>Each person has their own "view of life," which is each person's "meaning" and "flavor" of life. Therefore, society inevitably has many disputes, and the world is full of trouble. For example, the Japanese have a view of life based on venomous snakes and beasts; they find cruelty and viciousness the most flavorful. The Chinese have a view of life based on pigs and snails; they find stupidity and weakness the most flavorful. Or they have a view of life based on aphids; they find greed and self-interest the most flavorful. Or they have a view of life based on mice; they find timidity and fearfulness the most flavorful. Tastes differ, and appetites vary. Therefore, there is more than one kind of "view of life."</p>
<p>Stupidity, fear, weakness, deception, selfishness, arrogance, luxury, and ease are the favorite delicacies of the Chinese appetite, and they are also like the MSG of life. With the above virtues, life is not boring, and the body and mind feel comfortable. Isn't this making them the MSG of life? How can it be known that the Japanese use aggression, attack, cruelty, and fierceness to season their cooking? This kind of MSG is very meaningful in life. The nature of the MSG added to food is fundamentally different, so "national character" also differs.</p>
<p>We are born in China today, a country with internal and external troubles. First, we must fundamentally change our tastes and change our appetite. Quickly use "bravery," "frugality," "public spirit," and "righteousness" as the MSG of life. We should find it extremely flavorful to eat, able to strengthen our muscles and bones, increase our wisdom, and become a great nation in the world. We must never use "stupidity," "fear," "selfishness," "arrogance," "luxury," and "debauchery" as the MSG of life!</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Three: In the End, Failing to Untie the Bell, He Went to the Door and Made a Mistake, Secretly Pitying the Girl's Hair Knots; Wishing to Share Food with Others.</p>
<p>Old Man Zhao said, "I don't believe in saving money. What would I do with it? Would I take it to the coffin with me? You go now, don't waste time in the heavy snow. Hurry up, it's good to get some heat in your body." Zhao Ziqiang agreed and went out. Old Man Zhao closed the storm door and looked out at the snow scene through the glass window for a while, then continued reading his Romance of the Three Kingdoms. When he saw the battle scenes in the novel, he thought to himself, "My son is a company commander. A company commander in a battalion isn't small, but when tens of thousands of people are fighting, the sacrifice of a company commander is simply insignificant." Thinking of this, he couldn't read the novel anymore. From this gate, he could vaguely see the Xiyuan Barracks, so he put on his leather vest and walked towards the gate. Passing by the entrance of the Yang family's courtyard, he heard Guizhi say, "The Zhao company commander and his son in the backyard are really good. When I smell the aroma of this beef, my heart aches." Jiang said, "What are you sad about?" Guizhi said, "Can't I buy two catties of beef and make soup for you to drink?" Old Man Zhao was very touched when he heard this. In the afternoon, the beef soup was well simmered, so he used a pottery bowl to hold most of it and asked Xiaolin to invite Guizhi over. He said with a smile, "Girl, your heart is really kind. I have some soup here. Take it back and give it to your mother to drink." Guizhi said, "Drink! How can that be? This is Company Commander Zhao's filial piety to you, how can we take it?" Old Man Zhao said, "It doesn't matter! Our child can afford beef, but you can only afford radishes. This soup has our beef and your radishes. Considering our strength, the effort we put in this joint venture is about the same. Logically, you should get half." Guizhi smiled and said, "How can you say that?" Old Man Zhao took a step closer and said in a low voice, "You can smell the aroma of beef soup, doesn't your mother smell it? For this little bit, you should take it back for your mother to taste. You need to know: I'm not giving you something to eat, I'm just helping you fulfill your share of filial piety." These words moved Guizhi's heart, so she half-squatted and gave Old Man Zhao a bow, and said with a smile, "Then thank you." After saying that, she took the bowl of beef soup away. This bowl of beef soup, however, aroused a newly emerging plan in Jiang's mind. The joys and sorrows of life, the partings and reunions, are always like this, originating from a little thing.

<p>How many dramas of separation, reunion, joy, and sorrow are created and performed in the city. The city is a large theater for performing human dramas. The people in the city are the roles of the leading men, leading women, supporting actors, and clowns, as well as the audience in this large theater.</p>
<p>The urban theater also has playbills and programs, which describe or narrate the course of the plot, the time, place, characters, and roles played. This is the newspaper, which presents the plot to the public. The scenery of this large theater is completely real. The river is the Huangpu River, which is the port of Eastern civilization and also the river of Eastern sins. The buildings include high-rise buildings, smooth asphalt roads, bustling commercial centers, churches, parks, schools, winding alleys, dilapidated houses, and the ruins of battlefields... Sometimes, when the bride and groom come out of the church, confetti and rice will fall on their heads and bodies like a rainstorm! Their eyes will be blinded and they won't be able to see where they're going! Their bodies will be pushed down by the crowd! The bride's veil will be torn to shreds! The groom's formal wear (mostly rented) will be soiled! The guests have had their fun, but the parties involved inevitably suffer an unexpected loss.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Spanish Dancer</p>
<p>In the shop window on the street, there is a photo of a woman wearing a long skirt with a cluster of fresh flowers in her hair. What appears before me is Asuncion Granados, a Spanish dancer and pipa virtuoso, performing at the Summer Pic Theater. Tickets are priced at five yuan, three yuan, and two yuan, on April 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 11th, at 9:15 PM. There are also a few lines in English.</p>
<p>Looking at the large evening newspaper in my hand, I know that tonight is the second performance of this famous dancer. While I was pondering, a man in black clothes came across diagonally and turned his head to say:</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Shaw!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Mr. Zhang!"</p>
<p>"How have you been?"</p>
<p>"How have you been?"</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, just taking a walk on the street, waiting to see the 'Ah Sad Heart, Granada Peach' dance in a little while."</p>
<p>"How coincidental, I'm also planning to go."</p>
<p>"That's great, I've already bought two tickets. I'll give you one."</p>
<p>"What? Aren't you going with your wife? Then I won't be polite and will gratefully accept it. Thank you."</p>
<p>At 9:15, Mr. Shaw and I were sitting in the Summer Pic Theater. My number was H11, and the ticket stub was printed with Stalls S5.00.</p>
<p>Looking up, the stage was a dull black curtain, with two gold AG letters on the left and right, surrounded by a garland of auspicious grain. Below were women from Greek mythology, either dancing or playing music. In the left corner was a triangular-tailed black grand piano, completely like a memorial service scene, with only a portrait of the late Prime Minister or martyr missing in the center.</p>
<p>A Spanish man in a snow-white shirt and black evening dress came out, not a presenter. As soon as he sat down at the piano, I knew it was the pianist Jose Serrano. After the overture, a young girl in complete Spanish attire jumped out from behind the curtain. Her charming face, graceful posture, enchanting eyes, and gorgeous clothes were even more alluring and moving than the photo printed in the advertisement. In two hours, Granados performed eighteen solo dances. The dance moves and costumes were different for each dance. She is not like the jade-legged dances commonly seen on the screen. If you want to appreciate the rhythm of the music while her body is dancing, or want to smell a strong fragrance when she is sweating profusely from dancing, then you might as well go see Duncan or Tanixiang, the two dance stars. Granados cannot perform these two characteristics.</p>
<p>This night, I saw a program completely in Spanish for the first time in Shanghai. This Spanish dancer and pipa virtuoso performed a total of eighteen programs. Among them, "Spanish Serenade", "The Afflicted", El Delirio, etc. were the best.</p>
<p>Ah Sad Heart, Granados's only advantage is her pair of beautiful and flexible arms. She holds two wood-like Spanish special instruments, striking a series of crisp sounds. When struck rapidly, the sounds deeply hammer at your heartstrings. In the dim blue light, when she is spinning and dancing, her pair of bare arms move up and down like two white carp eels swimming and jumping, which can make you dizzy. When the dance reaches its climax, her long skirt spreads out like an opened umbrella, revealing a pair of snow-white and tender bare shanks, which can make people's hearts beat faster. The more she dances, the more excited she becomes. Occasionally, the wide skirt will fly to her waist like a balloon, and under the skirt, the pink shorts without leg pipes are faintly visible. Someone in the audience shouted Bravo, and she also sent an enchanting smile.</p>
<p>Granados has a thick waist and a bulging belly, which are two major shortcomings that cannot be improved. Also, she likes to wear high-heeled leather shoes when wearing long skirts, and she only uses a piano accompaniment from beginning to end. These will detract from her dance skills.</p>
<p>It is expected that Granados is not welcomed by the audience in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e205">New Advances in the Radio World: Vacuum Tubes That Don't Need Filaments <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenzhi</p>
<p>The fact that vacuum tubes need filaments is a shortcoming of vacuum tubes. Because with filaments, vacuum tubes have a certain lifespan. Therefore, the method of generating electrons by using ionized gas has become the goal of radio research. This work has already taken a lot of effort in Germany. What is introduced here is the wireless vacuum tube (also known as cold cathode vacuum tube) recently completed by Dr. Henderson in the United States.</p>
<p>The completed filamentless vacuum tubes have one, two, and three electrodes. As for four, five, six, and seven electrodes, they can all be made in theory. Now, let's explain one type of three-electrode filamentless vacuum tube to illustrate the rest.</p>
<p>The figure on the left is the external shape of the triode, and the figure below shows its internal structure. The bulb is filled with rare gas. A is the anode, and B is the cathode. A circuit is completed with a high-voltage battery and a certain amount of resistor. This resistor is used to limit the current in the tube, otherwise the current will reach an excessive value due to the too low resistance of the ionized gas. Now, connect the battery to the A and B electrodes, and a beautiful arc will occur between the electrodes. The bulb filled with xenon will be pink, and the bulb filled with helium will be purple. This arc is formed by the collision of positive ions and electrons dissociated by the applied voltage. C is a cylinder with many small holes (only one hole is drawn in the figure), which is sleeved outside the arc electrode. D is the grid, and E is the screen electrode. Its function is as follows: the cylinder with positive charge slows down the speed of the positive charge ions, so as not to disturb the electron flow between the cylinder and the screen electrode. Therefore, the grid placed in the middle of the electron flow can completely control the function of the bulb, just like an ordinary triode.</p>
<p>This type of vacuum tube has various functions, such as oscillation, amplification, amplitude modulation, and detection, and can be competent. It is expected that this type of product will be available on the market in a year.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Mineral Radio with Good Selectivity <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>Everyone knows that mineral radios are easy to manufacture and cost very little. After equipping them, they can be used permanently without spending any more money. What is considered most regrettable is that the sound is too weak and the sound reception is not good. And poor selectivity is also a major drawback. The former simply has no way to improve except by using vacuum tubes, while the latter is relatively easy to solve. Recently, the Popular Mechanics magazine published the manufacturing methods of several mineral radios with very good selectivity. The translator has tried them one by one and feels that the results are not bad, so he has translated them as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Type A Radio丨As shown in Figure A</p>
<p>This is just a mineral radio, and there is nothing special about it. It's just the relationship between the coils. L1 is the primary coil, and La is the secondary coil. They are wound on a bakelite tube that is three and a half inches long and two inches in diameter. Use No. 26 enameled wire. The primary coil is wound 23 turns, and the secondary coil is wound 72 turns. The Cl capacity is 0.00035MFD, and the C2 capacity is 0.001MFD. The dotted line in the figure indicates whether to use it at will, depending on the test results.</p>
<p>(2) Type B Radio丨丨As shown in Figure B</p>
<p>This mineral radio has an extra filter, so the selectivity can be increased, and the capacity of the components is also different.</p>
<p>The filter coil (Trap Coil) is wound on a bakelite tube that is three inches long and one and a half inches in diameter. Use No. 26 enameled wire to wind 94 turns. The capacity of Cl is 0.0005MFD. The primary coil L and the secondary coil L2 are wound on the same bakelite tube that is 21-2 inches long and 41-4 inches in diameter. Use No. 32 enameled wire. The primary coil is wound 17 turns, and the secondary coil is wound 107 turns. The capacity of C2 is 0.0005MFD, and the capacity of C3 is 0.002MED. The first thing to pay attention to is that the mineral radio needs good sky and ground lines. According to the author, when these two radios used exquisite sky and ground lines in Chicago, they had amazing results. From this, we know that the influence of sky and ground lines on mineral radios is not trivial.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the comrades who study radio can start with small components. You must know that a radio with more than a dozen tubes is not necessarily interesting. A small mineral radio may also give you a satisfactory hope.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Filter <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Qiyao</p>
<p>There are more and more radio broadcasting stations, and the radio waves in the air are becoming more and more complicated. Therefore, an ordinary radio can receive the broadcasts of almost every station on every dial. Sometimes, two stations can be received at the same time, resulting in mutual interference, often disrupting good programs, and there is no way to receive them. The filter can correct this problem and can filter out programs that you don't want to listen to or other broadcasts.</p>
<p>In practice, filters can be roughly divided into three types: the first type is a high-pass filter, which can allow current with a frequency higher than a certain frequency to pass through and filter out those with a frequency lower than a certain frequency; the second type is a low-pass filter, whose function is exactly the opposite of the above; the third type is a band-pass filter, which can allow current within a certain range from a certain frequency to a certain frequency to pass through, and those that are smaller or larger are filtered out.</p>
<p>Filter Construction: It is made by connecting coils and capacitors in series or parallel. The most commonly used filter on radios is shown in the figure. It can reduce the sound of the nearest radio station. The principle is as follows:</p>
<p>Suppose there are two waves with different frequencies FIF2, which induce currents J1I2 in the antenna, which pass through the abcd circuit. When the self-oscillation frequency of the LC circuit is equal to F1, the current Il is the smallest. Because the frequencies of F1 and F2 are different, the LC circuit cannot make F2 the smallest at the same time. In this way, the LC circuit can filter out the current I1 and allow the current I2 to pass through alone.</p>
<p>Making a filter is very simple. First, prepare a hard paper cylinder with a diameter of about 2 inches to 2.5 inches, and wind about fifty or sixty turns of No. 24 insulated copper wire on the outside to form an induction coil; then use a 0.0005uf or 0.00025uf variable capacitor and install it as shown in the figure. Connect one end to the antenna and the other end to the antenna terminal of the radio. The method of use is also very simple. For example, when the dial is at a certain degree, you can hear the broadcasts of both ABI stations at the same time. If we want to filter out the broadcast of station A, then first slowly rotate the dial to make the broadcast of station A match the loudest position, and then rotate the variable capacitance of the filter to make the broadcast of station A the lowest, until it is completely extinguished. In this way, we will not be disturbed by station A when listening to the broadcasts of station R or other stations.</p>
<h3 id="e208">About Power Supply: The Most Economical B Battery Substitute <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Renrong</p>
<p>Fans who play DC radios are always troubled by the excessive cost of daily electricity purchases. Here is the most economical B battery substitute. The materials used are as follows. If the power supply transformer can be wound by yourself, the total cost will be about fourteen or five yuan. T is the power supply transformer. The primary is two hundred or one hundred volts directly on the light bulb. The secondary can have two or three. One is a high-voltage coil to supply the plate and grid of the rectifier tube, which needs about two hundred volts. One is a five-volt low-voltage coil to supply the filament of the tube. The rest are reserved for A batteries. As for the design, it depends on the vacuum tube of the radio. V is a vacuum tube with a slightly larger plate current, such as 201, 509, 171, etc. L is a low-frequency choke coil (AudioFrequencyChoke) for filtering, which can be replaced by a secondary low-frequency transformer. C1 and C2 are both two megafarads (MFD) fixed capacitors. C3 is the same, but a capacity of only one megafarad is enough. R is a 40,000-ohm resistor, which can also be replaced by five photovoltaic light bulbs. It is nothing more than reducing the B voltage for the detection stage. The B negative (B·) is best connected to the ground wire, which can reduce the AC noise to a minimum. The high voltage output of this B battery substitute is about one hundred and sixty or seventy volts, so daily three- or four-tube DC radios can be used.</p>

<p>丨Can be used for four-tube radios丨</p>
<p>There is a small transformer for electric bells on the market, which is very small in size (4x4x2.5) and sold at a very low price. It is available in electrical material stores everywhere. The primary coil is connected to an external voltage of 200 to 250 volts, and the secondary has two coils (the transformer originally has only three terminals, and you must find a way to separate the two middle terminals during the改造, as shown in the first figure X). One is three volts and the other is five volts. The output power is about five or six watts. Connecting these three transformers together can supply power for a four-tube AC radio.</p>
<p>As shown in the second figure, the secondary coil S1 of T1 is for the filament of the 227 detection tube. (When using, if it exceeds 2.5 volts, a small light bulb can be connected in parallel for illuminating and adjusting the dial.) oS2 is for the filaments of two 201 low-frequency amplifier tubes. S3 of T2 is connected to S5 of T3, and S4 is for the filament of the 171 rectifier tube. If the OB voltage output is too high, you can rotate R to adjust it. oS6 is left unused. For detailed wiring methods, please refer to the second figure.</p>

<p>The World's Youngest Radio Broadcaster</p>
<p>Researcher</p>
<p>Alan T. Margo, a nine-year-old child in the United States, has passed the radio broadcasting researcher's test and succeeded. He serves in a radio station. Undoubtedly, he is the youngest public radio broadcasting researcher in the world. His radio knowledge was taught by his father. This wise father was already a radio broadcasting expert when he was a student in 1910. (Philips)</p>
<p>Radio Patents</p>
<p>Recent reports from the British Patent Office contain many requirements regarding radio patents. What inventors pay the most attention to is the method of increasing wave selection ability and the application of extremely short wavelengths. Regarding television, everyone is paying special attention to using other more suitable tools to replace the perforated disc.</p>

<p>New Products of Domestic Wireless Radios: The 1933 products of the manufacturing department of Jianhua Electric Company, No. 393 Foch Road, include a 5-watt wireless radio transceiver for both telegraphy and telephony. After more than two years of research, there have been many improvements, and the test results are very good. It is said that the machine is a suitcase type, and the transceiver is installed in one box. It can be used for both telegraphy and telephony. The surrounding area is less than two square feet. It is extremely lightweight and is a very convenient product for military travel aircraft.</p>
<p>In addition, the editorial department of Jianhua Company published various books in 1933. In addition to the newly published Wireless Radio Convention, the rest, such as "Introduction to AC Radios", "Dry Battery Storage Battery Charger", and "Shortwave Transmitter", will be published on time in the recent April, May, and June. It is said that the content of the book is very rich, especially focusing on manufacturing and repair.</p>
<p>Repairing Old Vacuum Tubes: The most important and valuable of the various materials for wireless radios is the vacuum tube. Each transmitting vacuum tube is worth as much as two or three thousand yuan or more. Once damaged, the loss is irreparable. Dahua Wireless Electric Company, No. 9 Sanma Road, Shanghai, has recently invented a repair method. All transmitting vacuum tubes with an output of 50 watts or more, even up to 20 kilowatts, can be repaired and guaranteed to be intact. The guarantee method is divided into three types: one is efficiency, the second is lifespan, and the third is output, all of which are the same as new products. The price is fair. Please send any broken vacuum tubes to the company for contact. However, receiving vacuum tubes are not repaired.</p>
<p>Recent News from the Repair Department of Yada Company: Yada Company, No. 25 Renji Road, this port, has achieved remarkable results in service since it specially set up a radio repair department. Those from all walks of life who entrust the company to repair radios are extremely crowded. The reason is that the company is serious in its work and strict in its management. The various repair instruments and equipment are complete. Moreover, Mr. Xu Zhifang, the former chief radio engineer of Kailuo Company and Wheeler Company, has been hired to take charge of the matter. Both theory and experience are emphasized. No matter what kind of radio has serious difficulties, it can be solved easily. Therefore, although the work is extremely busy, the delivery is very fast. Also, if you notify by telephone and ask them to go out for repairs, the company will arrive within an hour. At a time when all walks of life in Shanghai are feeling that it is not easy to find a proper place to repair radios, the company's service methods are indeed very convenient for those who purchase radios.</p>
<p>German or Xianglike Brand Fixed Capacitors Arrive in Shanghai: Xianglike brand fixed capacitors are produced by a famous German factory and have long been popular in Europe. They are now managed by Dahua Wireless Electric Company, No. 9 Sanma Road. Recently, a large batch of goods has arrived, with capacities ranging from zero one, zero two five, zero five, one, two, three, four, five, six, eight to ten Farads. The test pressure ranges from five hundred, seven hundred, one thousand, two thousand to three thousand volts. The pricing is very low. It is said that wireless radio researchers have flocked to order them.</p>

<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>From the time I have memories, until now, wherever I have been, in open spaces, I have often seen "magic shows," also called "conjuring tricks."</p>
<p>These conjuring tricks generally only come in two types:</p>
<p>One type involves teaching a monkey to wear a mask, put on clothes, and perform a series of sword and spear routines; riding a sheep in circles. There's also a bear, kept alive on thin rice porridge and already skin and bones, performing some tricks. Finally, they ask everyone for money.</p>
<p>The other type involves placing a stone in an empty box, covering it with a handkerchief from left to right, and conjuring a white dove; or stuffing paper into their mouth, lighting it, and making smoke and flames come out of their mouth and nostrils. Next, they ask everyone for money. After getting the money, one person pretends it's not enough and refuses to perform, while another person persuades him, telling everyone to give five more. Sure enough, people throw money, so they ask for four more, three more...</p>
<p>Once enough money is thrown, the magic show begins again. This time, a child is stuffed into a small-mouthed jar, with only a small braid visible. To get him to come out, they ask for more money. After collecting enough, somehow, the adult uses a sharp knife to stab the child to death, covers him with a bedsheet, and has him lie stiffly. To bring him back to life, they ask for more money.</p>
<p>"At home, rely on parents; away from home, rely on friends... HuazalHuazal," the magician says in a solemn and sorrowful tone, making a gesture of scattering money.</p>
<p>If other children get too close to watch carefully, he will scold them; if they don't listen, he will hit them.</p>
<p>Sure enough, many people "Huaza." When the amount is close to what they expected, they pick up the money, pack up their gear, and the dead child also gets up on his own and walks away with them.</p>
<p>The onlookers disperse in a daze.</p>
<p>The open space is temporarily silent. After some time, this routine comes again. As the saying goes, "Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has different skills." In reality, it's always the same routine for many years, and there are always people watching, always people "Huaza," but there must be a few days of silence in between.</p>
<p>I've finished talking, and the meaning is very simple, just saying: after everyone "HuazaHusza" for a while, there will be a few days of silence, and then this routine will come again.</p>
<p>Only now do I remember that I wrote the title wrong; this has truly become something that is "neither dead nor alive."</p>
<h3 id="e213">A Stroll in the Deep Night <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>A street that would be very lively during the day is very quiet at night. The shops on both sides, except for perhaps one or two open all night, are all closed; the sidewalks are crisscrossed with patches of light, now dim, now bright, coming from the poles, from the wires, from the houses, or sometimes, from the moon.</p>
<p>Strolling alone in such a scene will make you think of many things you have forgotten: a glance of an eye, a squeeze of a hand, a shake of a head. However, thinking of all this is like thinking of other people's affairs; the emotions of joy or anger that you felt when these things first happened will not return to you; at most, you will only smile knowingly, your soul and your thoughts understanding each other.</p>
<p>Strolling like this, you will also sink your whole body and mind into empty thoughts, thoughts emptier than empty dreams. You will think that when it dawns, there will be two suns fighting in the sky, or that the earth is already rotating westward; you will think that your soul may have become someone else's soul, or that your body is definitely no longer your own body. You will think of chewing iron, swallowing fire, or drinking all the water in the world, to make people feel the thirst of life.</p>
<p>Sometimes your train of thought will be cut off by the headlights of a car, but even if it is cut off, you will not want to extend it again; or you will no longer remember what you were just thinking, and you will start thinking about something else, or you will simply not pay attention to those headlights, and even if you do pay attention, you will still continue your train of thought. You are no longer your own master; your master is thinking itself.</p>
<p>There are also times when you suddenly feel that someone else is walking in front of or behind you, and you also realize that his pace has been consistent with yours since you don't know when, so you speed up or slow down your pace to make it different from his, and as soon as you see a corner, you turn, so as to start another solitude.</p>
<p>What a stroll in the deep night makes you think of is far different from what you would think of at any other time or in any other situation.</p>

<p>— by A. Mallrois, translated by Wei Ke</p>
<p>"One hour is enough; and the sad thing is, Grace, this thing can succeed."</p>
<p>"Let's try it."</p>
<p>"But I can't brag."</p>
<p>"Then, my child, whenever someone asks about your background, you may hesitate for a moment, blow a large puff of smoke directly into the questioner's nose, and then say the following very simple sentence: 'Have you never seen a river?'"</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"It means nothing," Grace said, "so they will find your words very beautiful. When you have been fully discovered, understood, and praised by them, we will reveal the inside story of this matter and make fun of their embarrassment."</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Two months later, the preview exhibition one day before the official opening of the Tuoshi Painting Exhibition was completely successful. The beautiful Mrs. Koslesursga, with her sweet and gentle voice and fragrant body, never left her new great man.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed repeatedly, "This artistic sensibility, imagination, and power! What wisdom, what revelation! But, dear, how did you achieve such an amazing synthesis?"</p>
<p>The painter hesitated for a moment, blew out a large puff of smoke, and said, "Dear madam, have you never seen a river?"</p>
<p>Then the beautiful Polish woman's lips moved, and she spoke many congratulations in a sweet and gentle voice. The young and famous Lewig, wearing a rabbit fur collar coat, argued in a large crowd: "Really sharp! Really sharp! I have long said that the most despicable thing is to paint according to a model. But, Tuoshi, tell me, where did you get this revelation? Did you get it from my thesis?"</p>
<p>Tuoshi really hesitated for a moment, blew a triumphant puff of smoke into his nose, and then said, "Sir, have you never seen a river?"</p>
<p>"Excellent!" Lewig expressed his approval, "Excellent!"</p>
<p>At this time, a famous day merchant visited the studio, took the painter's sleeve, and led him to a corner. "Tuoshi, my friend, you are really a cunning thing. This can be blown up. Please leave all your works to me. Before I tell you, don't change your painting style, I will sell fifty works for you every year... Is that okay?"</p>
<p>Tuoshi mysteriously smoked, noncommittal.</p>
<p>The studio slowly emptied. When the last visitor went out, Grace went to close the door, and we heard the murmuring praises on the stairs gradually fading away.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Where's Lao Cao?"</p>
<p>"He went to Lao Ha's place. Lao Ha sent someone to call him early in the morning."</p>
<p>She answered him with a smile.</p>
<p>"… Mr. Lin, please wait a moment, I'll get some water for you to wipe your face."</p>
<p>"No, I can do it myself."</p>
<p>He said, putting on his outer coat and pants. After putting them on, he got out of bed.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry about last night."</p>
<p>Hao suddenly blushed and said to him. But he couldn't figure out what was going on. He thought that she hadn't done anything wrong to him last night.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"That annoying thing, Shiguang…"</p>
<p>She didn't finish her sentence and laughed as if it was very interesting. But Haiquan couldn't laugh at all. He just opened his mouth and stared at her blankly. "…I said, Mr. Lin is here, you shouldn't be so improper, but Shiguang still…"</p>
<p>She blushed even more.</p>
<p>Just as Haiquan was at a loss, he suddenly saw the second landlord's maid sending a letter up from downstairs.</p>
<p>"A letter for Mr. Lin, sent by a child."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Haiquan hurried out of the stairwell and took the letter. He knew that it was written by Tang Yaoxing, because he had told Tang Yaoxing the day before yesterday that he would temporarily use Cao Shiguang's residence as a temporary communication address. His fingertips trembled as he opened the letter and looked at it.</p>
<p>"Demon this afternoon, please participate. Meet at my place at twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>Seeing only the abbreviated word "Demon," his limbs, like his chest, trembled. He thought, is Tang Yaoxing really going to carry out what he said that day? This is not something to be taken as a game. Ah! Danger! Danger!</p>
<p>"That night, I shouldn't have signed the word so confusedly. My heart is exceptionally cowardly. But my mouth said very tough things. Now the day of the test has arrived."</p>
<p>After only the novelist and the painter were left, the novelist quickly put his hands in his pockets and burst into a terrifying laugh. Tuoshi looked at him in surprise. "Look!" My child, Grace said, "Don't you believe we have conquered them? Did you hear the words of that little trickster wearing a rabbit fur collar? And the words of that beautiful Polish woman? And the three young and beautiful girls repeatedly saying: 'So new! So new!' Ah! Tuoshi, I know that the stubbornness of mankind is unfathomable, but such a result has exceeded my expectations."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he couldn't stop laughing again. The painter frowned, and when the other party laughed so hard that he couldn't catch his breath, he suddenly said:</p>
<p>"You stupid thing!"</p>
<p>"Stupid thing!" the novelist shouted angrily. "When I succeeded in the most beautiful caricature since Picasso…"</p>
<p>The painter glanced at the twenty analytical portraits with a proud expression and said decisively:</p>
<p>"Yes, Grace, you are a stupid thing. There is something in these paintings…"</p>
<p>The novelist stared at his friend in horror. "This is terrible!" he exclaimed, "Tuoshi, remember. Who gave you the hint of this new painting method?"</p>
<p>So Tuoshi hesitated for a moment and blew out a puff of smoke:</p>
<p>"Have you never seen a river?" (End)</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Hair of the Soviet People <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Duo</p>
<p>Now, almost all the modern young ladies, wives, and female students in Shanghai apply rouge and powder, paint their eyebrows, and dye their hair. Of course, delicate eyebrows and loose hair do add a lot of artificial beauty, but it is inevitably too troublesome.</p>
<p>Among women in the Soviet Union, very few use artificial means to embellish their appearance. Women who apply rouge and powder, paint their eyebrows, or perm their hair probably cannot be found in one or two out of a thousand women; and these one or two are only those non-Party and non-League actresses, the wives and young ladies of embassies and consulates, the wives and daughters of foreign technicians and engineers, and the very rare prostitutes who lead stressful lives. They want to win the favor of those they like, so they have to scheme and fight, and dress up in fancy clothes. They are willing to spend even fifty rubles to have their hair done once.</p>
<p>The working women in factories and farms do not have much free time to decorate themselves, nor are they willing to engage in meaningless decorations. The romance of "looking at makeup under the crystal curtain" in a deep boudoir is indeed not easy to find in the Soviet Union. In their spare time, if they don't go to literacy classes, libraries, or cram schools to study, they go to do those physical and mental exercises, such as shooting, swimming, and skating. Soviet men's haircuts are also not like those modern young masters in China who imitate fashionable women and perm their hair into curls. They only need ten minutes to get a haircut when they go to the barber shop. The barber only cuts some long hair, shaves seven or eight times on the left and right cheeks and upper and lower jaws, and simply finishes the haircut procedure. They will never wash their faces, take out earwax, comb their hair, knock on their backs, spray perfume, or apply cold cream for the barber. However, the white cloth around the neck and the brushes used for shaving must be sent to the laundry factory for disinfection after each use before they are allowed to be used again; otherwise, they will be punished by the Health Bureau.</p>

<p>Gold Price Soars by Fifteen and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Future Exchange Market Expected to Tighten After Silver Tax Implementation in China</p>
<p>Recent Scarcity of Bar Amounts Fuels Significant Price Increase</p>
<p>Guangdong Banks Aggressively Buying, Counterparts Rush to Cover</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a strong bullish trend. At the opening, prices rose due to increases in both near and far-term rates in London by 1.25, a rise in New York silver prices by 0.375, and an increase in far-term silver prices by 0.016. Private telegrams and US cotton also rose and fell. The initial gross price rose from 134 yuan to 56 yuan. The exchange market opened with both British and American rates easing, so the opening price was 1084.3 yuan. However, because this silver price increase was expected, banks had a good appetite and the trend tightened. Macgary first bought US dollars for July at 29.5 yuan, forming a rise. Guangdong banks aggressively purchased, and the exchange rate announced by HSBC showed that both British and American rates were unchanged, but the bullish trend was not weak, and the exchange market followed suit. As the session rotated, Macgary had bought US dollars for July at nearly noon at 29.3125 yuan, so the noon close was 1097 yuan. The bullish trend continued strongly in the afternoon. The opening price increased to 1101 yuan. Gold dealers sought to settle US dollar exchanges, and US dollars for July tightened to 125, but banks were unwilling to release them. Guangdong Hengxing recklessly advanced the amount of bars, the bar amount was dry, and the increase to 1109 yuan was also a new high price. Banks then began to sell off, and many gold businesses also sold bars to arbitrage. Bombay initially rose by 6 annas, followed by a major anna. Although the silver price meeting was proposed and postponed, it once fell to 3.6 yuan, but remained stable, and the closing price was 1105.7 yuan. The frequent bullish trend is due to the expectation of a tightening of the exchange market after the silver tax is levied in China, and the recent extremely dry bar amount has fueled the bullish trend a lot. The price difference between spot and future contracts is extremely flat, calculated as an increase of 21 yuan. Swaps continued to decline, with the premium being 89 yuan. In one day, Guangdong banks jointly imported three thousand seven to eight hundred bars. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1084.3 yuan, a decrease of 5.9 yuan from the previous closing. Goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with the British exchange at 1 shilling 8 pence 3125 (16.524), an increase of 125 compared to the previous closing. The US exchange was 29 yuan (4.82), an increase of 125 compared to the previous closing. However, this price was difficult to settle, and the bank had no intention of selling. Macgary first paid 29.5 yuan for US dollars in July, and then the trend gradually tightened. Although Yuanchun sold, the goods hedging were all received, and Fuchang Hengyu Zhaofengchang competed to advance to 7 yuan. Macgary first bought US dollars for July at 29.5 yuan, and Dadecheng advanced to 7.4 yuan, Hengyu Chunyuan Yongzhifengyong further advanced to 9.5 yuan. The goods hedging were then sold, with US dollars for July at half a yuan, all required by the banks. Shengda took the stage to deliver bars, and then it was good to more than 9 yuan, but because US dollars for May at 0625 could be settled, Zhifengyong sold them, and it was 7 yuan. Shengda's buying intention was extremely strong, and Qianchangxiang also received them. Mitsui and Wabi made a deal on US dollars for July at half a yuan, Yuanmaoyong came up to buy, and at this time people's hearts were extremely good. In addition, the exchange market was also good, and those who wanted to receive 125 for US dollars in May and half a yuan for July were surging, so they wore more than 90 yuan. After entering, US dollars for June at 25 and for July at 4375 were difficult to settle, and Daxing Yongfu Yu competed to buy them, so they rose to 92.5 yuan. HSBC announced its exchange rate at this time, and the British and American rates were unchanged. However, because banks were willing to sell US dollars for July at 375, Fuchang sold slightly, and Yuanmaoyong Fu Yu also sold, Mitsui plugged out US dollars for July at 375, and retreated to 89.8 yuan, Shunli then advanced, and still rose back. Zhaofengchang advanced to 2.8 yuan, and scattered households sold, and it was 1.2 yuan. Wanxing then bought, Wabi pulled US dollars for July at 375, Shengda bought it, and then rose to 3.5 yuan, Fuchang came to sell again, gradually retreating. Macgary entered US dollars for July at 375, and exited US dollars for May at 29 yuan, Yuanshengyong suddenly came to sell, US dollars for July at 375 were difficult to sell, Yifengyong sold them, and then fell to 89 yuan, people's hearts were still stable, Yuanmaoyong advanced bars, Shengda advanced them, and Hengxing also bought them to more than 94 yuan, then added them to 5.5 yuan, Zhongfu Zhejiang issued US dollars for June at 125, retreating to 4 yuan, After that, the market situation was prosperous, Shengda's buying intention was extremely excited, the exchange market was also good, Macgary bought US dollars for July at 3125, Yuanmaoyong also came to cover the short position, soaring upwards, and the noon close was 1097 yuan. After the closing, the remaining wind did not stop, and continued to rise, Yuanmaoyong still received it, Zhaofengchang advanced to 100 yuan, Fuchang further received it, and it was 01 yuan, and the goods were then auctioned at 100 yuan and 005 angle.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 1101 yuan, and the goods opened at the same price. Then, from 100 yuan it rose to 02 yuan, which was the force of Hengyu's slight advance and the fierce lifting of scattered households. However, because Hongli Zhaofengchang came out, it retreated to 100 yuan. Runchangyu advanced bars within the limit, and Fuchang also advanced, still rising. In addition, Bingxing came to advance bars fiercely, and then it rushed to more than 4 yuan, Zhaofengchang still came to sell and fell slightly, US dollars for July at 125, US dollars for June at 9375 The gold industry fiercely dug but did not get it, and the advancers surged, Yuanmaoyong on behalf of Bingxing also came to buy bars, the market situation was very tense, Hengxing also received them, and rose to more than 5 yuan, Wabi ate US dollars for this month at 6875, Hengxing bought them willfully, Hengyu Qianchangxiang Zhifengyong Yuanshengyong all came to compete to advance, the exchange market was also good, US dollars for July at 125 (4.8) were temporarily short of supply, and then rose to 1109 yuan, which was a new high price. Until Wabi came out with US dollars for July at 0625, the sellers were quite forceful, at 29 yuan 125, after that, Bombay rose slightly, the trend has eased, and because of the news of the silver price meeting, the bank plugged out US dollars for August at 375, and until the end it was reported that the postponement was postponed, and the situation was still tense, Macgary reversed to eat 25, the closing price was the recent British exchange at 1 shilling 8 pence 0625 (16.731), a tightening of 125 compared to the previous closing, the US exchange was 28 yuan 5625 (4.896), a tightening of 3125 compared to the previous closing, banks did more on the upper part of the morning, and plugged in on the afternoon. The gold industry had little pulling in and plugging in in the morning, and then pulled in and hedged, because the gold industry was still short by more than 3 million. The bank's incoming and outgoing records for the day are as follows.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was chaotic, and the ship's side seemed to be dry. In summary, Hengxing Shengda Bingxing Yuanmaoyong Ruixing Zhaofengchang Dadecheng Fuchang Daxingyong Runchangyu and others all entered, and Shunli Wanxing Hongli Yuankangxiang Yongfeng Yifengyong Yuanchun goods and spot numbers all sold, Dalian gang squeezed out, Guangdong gang Hengxing Shengda jointly advanced three four thousand bars, and the total number of bars in May was 18,774.</p>
<p>In April, 84 public orders were released by Yingfeng Heng and 14 by Yongfeng, and 70 public orders were received by Tongfeng Heng, 21 by Runchangyong, and 7 by Runchangyu, for a total of 98 public orders received and released.</p>

<p>Discount rates increased…Collection and settlement returned to normal</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver collection and settlement only included the foreign merchant banks on the Bund continuing to handle mutual collection and settlement, and they also accepted payments from Chinese merchant banks at a rate of 715 per foreign currency. It is estimated that the foreign banks collected and settled silver for bill drafts, telegraphic transfers, collateral, miscellaneous items, and other items totaling 5.45 million.

The collection and settlement of the foreign public exchange by money shops is still in the process of being organized, and the organization procedures are being rushed, but it will still take time to extend the time, and it is not easy to calculate at one time. The foreign public exchange collection and settlement the night before last was as high as over 40.28 million yuan. The market interest rate for foreign exchange was 6 fen, the same in the morning and afternoon. Silver discounts have been cancelled.

<p>The financial community traditionally used silver as the standard. All transactions, incoming and outgoing, were calculated in silver. Foreign currency had to be converted to silver at a fixed rate for accounting. After the Ministry of Finance officially announced the abolition of silver, there was initially a wait-and-see attitude. Although the abolition of the "li" rate was implemented on March 1, silver and foreign currency were still used in transactions. After a delay of more than a month, on April 6 (i.e., the day before yesterday), the Ministry of Finance suddenly issued a telegram ordering the implementation of the foreign currency standard within a limited time. This sudden measure was unexpected by the financial community, so they held a meeting overnight to discuss solutions. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, banks and money shops were extremely busy with the closing of accounts. It was reported that banks such as the Central Bank of China and the Bank of China extended their office hours to midnight to handle the exchange of silver and foreign currency, organize collection and settlement, and change transfer methods. Yesterday, the work was not completely finished, so there will still be one or two busy days.</p>

<p>Public confidence is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>Public bonds show signs of continuing prosperity.</p>
<p>A uniform rebound of 45 jiao to 1.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the public bond market gradually recovered, showing signs of continuing prosperity. Although the communist rebellion was fierce, Commander-in-Chief Chiang had already arrived in Nanchang, and public sentiment was greatly stabilized. The crisis on Qinhuangdao Island had been resolved, and public confidence in the market was gradually stabilizing. However, there were still sell orders for No. 38 bond and the Northern Syndicate in the morning. The initial prices of each lot rose slightly, and the 20-roll bond even rose by 45 fen. The auction for consolidated salt tax bonds declined by 23 fen, likely due to oversupply. There were continuous sell orders in the second lot, and market prices continued to weaken. Among them, the No. 19 customs bond rose by 2 jiao due to the unique demand for No. 20 bond. The salt tax also rose by 2 jiao due to purchases by the Northern Syndicate. Therefore, the situation in the morning was still chaotic. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the Japanese cabinet was about to collapse, and Araki may not be able to carry out his militaristic policies. Public confidence in the market suddenly turned high, and No. 38 bond had also stopped selling. Therefore, the prices of both lots in the afternoon rose by 12 jiao to 45 jiao, and trading was also more active than in the morning. Most of the buyers were the Northern Syndicate and guest syndicates. The resulting market prices rebounded uniformly by 45 jiao to 1.2 yuan, mostly recovering the losses from the previous day. The future may not decline in the short term. The total transaction volume was 6,722,000 yuan, including 12,000 yuan in spot goods and 6,710,000 yuan in futures, of which consolidated salt tax accounted for 2.8 million yuan, demobilization bonds for about 1.2 million yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 450,000 yuan.</p>

<p>A report from the New Feng Trading Company stated that on Thursday (the 6th), the New York stock market trended upwards due to the rebound of railway stocks and the continued rise in wheat prices. The former was because the Chicago Northwestern Railway authorities officially denied that the railway was about to go bankrupt and reorganize, while the latter was because of poor harvest news, reduced exports from Australia and Argentina, and no shipments from the Soviet Union, resulting in strong momentum and extremely active trading. According to industry insiders, wheat prices are expected to rise by 7 jiao in the short term. The total volume traded today was 1.23 million shares. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Bank's rediscount rate was changed from 3.5% to 3%, and the 60-day loan interest rate was 1.25%, and the 90-day rate was 1.5%.

<p>Main Reason...American Cotton Rises and Yarn Sales Expand</p>
<p>Yarn will be traded in silver dollars starting today. The market trend is quite strong due to the rise in foreign cotton prices and the continued improvement in customer sales. Various syndicates are actively involved, with many purchases from the South China region and increasing activity along the Yangtze River. As a result, public confidence is good, and the market is trending higher. However, sellers still do not have a large amount of hedging, and their underlying holdings are too thick, leading to a lukewarm attitude. However, after a long period of decline, customers are eager to act. If actual sales continue to come in, there is hope of reaching a price of 200 yuan in the near future.</p>

<p>The opening of the yarn market today saw a slight increase in American cotton prices and a three-day suspension of trading. The current yarn sales are good, so the number of buyers in the market increased, and the market sentiment was quite tight. Prices for each month rose by 2 yuan. In the afternoon, there were reports of very good customer sales, and prices for each month rose again by 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 jiao. However, a certain firm sold 2,000 bales in the near month.

<p>Fujian 150 Jiangxi 100 Xiamen 10</p>
<p>Shantou 210 Sichuan 75</p>
<p>The cotton market also saw a strong rise due to the continuous rise in American cotton prices for three days, the rise in gold prices, and the development of yarn sales, causing market sentiment to tighten. However, Indian cotton prices remained flat. The future direction will still depend on the fluctuations of foreign cotton prices.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 30 sources of rice, and demand from urban and rural shops and stomachs remained strong. The prices of freshly colored Suzhou Tongbang rice and Nangang rice continued to rise by a few jiao. Due to commission issues, Hakka merchants stopped trading. Tianjin customers intended to deduct 2 jiao and 5 fen, while sellers were only willing to pay 2 jiao and 3 fen. The two sides were in disagreement over this 2-fen commission, so Qingjiao and other thin rice varieties were sold off with no orders. Market prices remained firm. There was a lack of goods for Duyangjian and Yinyuan, and prices continued to rise. Bianyuan sales were slightly active, with no change in prices.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 20 sources of rice from various routes in Hexia. White japonica rice sales were sluggish, and there was a lack of high-quality rice deliveries. The market was weak by a few fen. There were few thin rice arrivals, and sales were flat, with prices remaining stable. There were few early rice arrivals, and sales were active, with prices slightly tight. Dujian was flat, Yanjian was slightly soft, and Kejian had no gains or losses. Dingli set a firm price for Bujian Yinyuan.</p>

<p>(Hakka Indica Rice) Yesterday, Hakka Indica rice sales in Fujian remained active, with slight arrivals. There were also arrivals of foreign rice. The market remained stable. Recently, Hakka Indica rice arrivals have been strong, further affected by the new arrivals and new prices of foreign rice. Prices have fallen uniformly. However, after a slight price decrease, this led to a booming purchase from Fujian merchants, so the situation has turned around. Yesterday, 1,355 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were offered at a price of 8.35 to 8 yuan, 500 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were offered at a price of 8.45 to 8.35 yuan, and 400 bags of machine-milled red rice were offered at a price of 8.3 to 8.2 yuan. Among them, in addition to 100 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice purchased by the local street office, all were purchased by Fujian merchants.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Fook Ka Company has been arriving with goods for several days. The Saigon No. 1 rice that arrived previously has already been purchased by the local street office for several hundred bags at a price of only 8.1 yuan because the quality of the goods is relatively poor, so the selling price is also low. Old goods from Anli Company are being sold for 8.15 yuan. Saigon and Mindang shipments that are being loaded now and will be shipped in April and May have also been traded, but they have not yet been sold on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Flour and Wheat Prices Vary <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The current month flour market is uniquely popular, with a small difference of half a fen to one fen from later months.</p>
<p>The long-term wheat market is good by 4 to 7 fen, with the current month following closely by one fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, foreign wheat futures and spot prices both rose. In addition to Hakka merchants purchasing spot goods, they also purchased standard near-term contracts, so the prices of near and far months rose uniformly, with the largest increase being about one fen. However, after the rise, factories hedged a large batch of long-term flour, and the market suddenly fell again. Hakka merchants are very active in current flour, and both buying and selling are present in the long term, so the long-term price still fell. The current month, due to the extraction of cash, closed still up 2.5 li, May was unchanged, June was down a small fen, July was down 0.75 fen, August was down half a fen, and September was down a small fen.</p>
<p>The wheat market presented a swirling situation in both the upper and lower markets. However, the standard wheat has been changed to a foreign currency standard. In the future, orders with foreign merchants must also be calculated in foreign currency. Traders generally believe that after foreign firms take the foreign currency standard, they must raise prices to sell, so they all intend to purchase. The foreign wheat telegram rose by 34 jiao, and the spot price also rose by 35 fen. Furthermore, due to the rise in gold prices, the exchange rate increased even more. Therefore, in the long-term closing, September was up 7 fen, August was up 4 fen, July was up 5 fen, and the current month had some goods arriving to hedge, following closely by only one fen. Yesterday, the Grain Exchange changed to the foreign currency standard, and the above-mentioned price increases are all calculated in foreign currency.</p>

<p>The North-South goods industry implemented the abolition of taels and change to yuan on the 6th. Therefore, the industry association specifically convened a temporary meeting yesterday to discuss and decide to comply with the order to switch to the foreign currency standard from today onwards. For previous incoming and outgoing funds that were traditionally calculated in silver, in addition to converting to foreign currency at the legal rate of 715, future incoming and outgoing transactions will all be based on the foreign code standard. All rules remain the same. The following is a revised foreign code, which was previously strongly opposed to using the four-舍-六-入 method for converting silver to foreign currency at a rate of 715:</p>
<p>Previous Silver Amount Current Foreign Amount One Qian and Four Fen Two Jiao</p>
<p>Three Fen Four Fen One Qian and Five Fen Two Jiao and One Fen</p>
<p>Six Fen Eight Fen Two Qian Two Jiao and Eight Fen</p>
<p>One Qian One Jiao and Four Fen Two Qian and Eight Fen Three Jiao and Nine Fen</p>
<p>One Qian and Two Fen One Jiao and Seven Fen Three Qian Four Jiao and Two Fen</p>
<p>The above sales are traditionally quoted in yuan</p>
<p>Previous Silver Amount Current Foreign Amount Previous Silver Amount Current Foreign Amount</p>
<p>One Qian and Two Fen One Jiao and Seven Fen Two Qian Two Jiao and Eight Fen</p>
<p>One Qian and Four Fen Two Jiao Two Qian and Five Fen Three Jiao and Five Fen</p>
<p>The above purchases traditionally deduct yuan</p>
<p>Furthermore, all incoming and outgoing foreign currency transactions will be calculated in silver dollars, with small foreign coins discounted according to the market. For sales to Guangdong, Xiamen, Fujian, Xinghua, Quanzhou, and other gangs that originally shipped goods from foreign warehouses, the outbound tax is set at 3 fen per bag of foreign yarn and 5 fen per item for other packages.</p>

(4) Japan is spreading various unfounded rumors in our country, and it is also fabricating various rumors internally to deceive the people. (5) Japanese warlords oppress the people, who do not dare to say a word of dissatisfaction with the government in their own country, so the people are all resentful of the warlords.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry plans to establish a national paper mill. After sending personnel to Wenzhou to investigate raw materials, the investigation results show that the bamboo produced in Wenzhou is indeed suitable for papermaking raw materials. However, the area lacks high-altitude hydraulic power and cannot use water to generate electricity. It has now been decided to build the national paper mill in Shanghai. A pulp mill will be established in Wenzhou to specialize in manufacturing papermaking raw materials for shipment to Shanghai. The total capital amount is set at five million yuan, to be jointly funded by the government and merchants. The government is raising more than two million yuan, and three million yuan will be raised from the business community.

<p>Reducing Tariffs is One of the Main Topics</p>
<p>Establishing a Foundation for the London Conference in Advance</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 7th Prime Minister Daladier met with former Prime Minister Herriot and explained to him what the former French Ambassador to the United States, Claudel, had recently discussed with US Secretary of State Hull (i.e., inviting France to send a representative to the United States to participate in negotiations) and asked Herriot to represent France and meet with Roosevelt and MacDonald in Washington. Herriot has not yet responded to this request, but it is generally believed that Herriot will not refuse.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 7th It has been learned that Mussolini originally intended to appoint Rosso, the Italian Ambassador to the United States, as the Italian representative to the Washington conference to discuss economic matters, as Rosso is an economic expert. However, now that British Prime Minister MacDonald has agreed to go to Washington in person, and important figures from other countries may also travel to the United States together, it is planned to appoint a higher-ranking representative. It is rumored that Finance Minister Yoon has already agreed to Prime Minister's summons and will travel to London to meet with Prime Minister, and now may be ordered to attend the conference convened by President Roosevelt in the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th After the British Prime Minister accepted the US invitation, the United States has invited the leaders of the French, Italian, and German governments to come to Washington to discuss the preparations for the World Economic Conference. This invitation was conveyed verbally by the US ambassadors to the three countries. If the government leaders cannot come, other important government officials are also welcome. Otherwise, diplomatic authorities can exchange views. Future international talks will be conducted separately, not in a round-table format. It is reported that President Roosevelt will devote all his efforts to reducing commercial and financial barriers, roughly based on a direct reduction of import tariffs by one-tenth, but the war debt issue will not be a major issue in the discussion, as this issue is only one element of the situation. In addition to inviting the four major European powers of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, the United States has today also expressed its willingness to discuss the World Economic Conference with other relevant countries, in order to prepare everything for the future London Conference and save many weeks of work when the conference is held.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 7th Prime Minister MacDonald has accepted the invitation from the United States and will cross the Atlantic soon. Political circles believe that the Preparatory Committee for the Geneva World Economic Conference may not be able to convene before the Prime Minister returns from the United States.</p>

Göring will travel by plane and is expected to arrive on Monday. It is generally believed that Papen's visit to Italy is on behalf of Chancellor Hitler to convey to the Pope Hitler's intention to maintain religious policies and to explain the relationship between the Hitler government and the Center Party in domestic politics. It is rumored in the Vatican that Hitler will come to Rome soon and plans to visit the Pope, and Papen has been specially instructed to make arrangements in advance.</p>

<p>France Consistently Opposes Treaty Revision</p>
<p>Obstacles to the Four-Power Pact are Numerous</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th German newspapers have reacted to French Prime Minister Daladier's recent speech in the National Assembly. The Berliner Tageblatt stated that Daladier's speech showed his opposition to Mussolini's plan. The Vossische Zeitung stated that Daladier rejected the proposal for the Four-Power Pact. Germania's editorial finally stated, "Mussolini's plan has been eliminated." The Kreuzzeitung accused the French parliament of undermining the Four-Power Pact plan.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 7th During the debate on foreign policy in the Chamber of Deputies, right-wing member Bouisson stated that the Four-Power Pact was tantamount to three countries forcing the fourth country to recognize treaty revisions. Radical Party leader Herriot stated that he fully agreed with Prime Minister Daladier's declaration but said that the British plan was very different from the French plan. The current Roman plan is very different from what it was before the 15th. In its original form, it cannot be recognized by France. Herriot stated that the government would explain the points in the League of Nations Covenant that link the various clauses on treaty revision. His attitude can be said to be cautious, as he believes that treaty revisions must obtain the consent of the people. Therefore, revisions cannot be made if the people do not agree. Herriot believes that in addition to the four major European powers, the United States is also involved, and why shouldn't Soviet Russia cooperate? Herriot also believes that treaty revisions must be based on two principles: one is national self-determination, and the other is equality for all countries. He opposes both the conclusion of alliances and isolationist policies. Herriot finally stated that the government will always support the League of Nations and will never change its stance on the principles advocated by France at the Disarmament Conference. His attitude is commendable.</p>

Nagai made a brief speech, first mentioning the Japanese people's admiration and friendship for the German nation, and then discussing international politics, saying that Japan and the League of Nations had failed to agree on a good method for maintaining peace in the Far East. Therefore, Japan had no choice but to withdraw from the League of Nations. However, Japan is always prepared to cooperate amicably with other countries in order to realize the ideals of mankind. Therefore, Japan's withdrawal from the League does not mean that it is isolated from the rest of the world. President Hindenburg expressed his gratitude.</p>

<p>A new law was promulgated today, under which each state will have an administrator appointed by the central government who will have complete control over the state cabinet. The administrators are subject to Hitler's control. Hitler himself is already the administrator of the state of Prussia and is expected to appoint Deputy Prime Minister von Papen or Speaker of the Reichstag Göring as the Prime Minister of Prussia. The new law makes state elections unnecessary.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th The German government plans to implement the system of the former provinces of Alsace and Lorraine (now belonging to France) before the European War in all states to promote the unity of the federation. According to the government plan, each state will lose its "state" status and become a "region" of the federation. Each region will be ruled by a governor who is only subject to the central government and has the power to appoint and dismiss the administrative heads of each "region" (i.e., the current state prime ministers). Hitler will appoint himself as the governor of the state of Prussia. Once this plan is implemented, the internal affairs of Germany will be thoroughly unified, and the autonomy that each state has been striving to maintain will be eliminated.</p>

<p>Minister of Finance Remains Determined to Resign</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saito Finds it Difficult to Stay in Office</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th The impact of the decision to retain Minister of Justice Oyama on the political situation is highly valued by all parties. The government side regards the resignation issue of Minister of Justice Oyama as a source of instability within the cabinet. Now that it has been resolved, Prime Minister Saito's plan to extend the life of the cabinet can proceed unimpeded. However, there is still a major unresolved issue, namely the resignation issue of Finance Minister Takahashi, which has no solution. Therefore, the cabinet's instability remains unresolved. Although Prime Minister Saito tried his best to persuade the Minister of Finance to stay after visiting the Yuen Palace on his way back from visiting the Grand Shrine, the Minister of Finance is respecting the tacit understanding with President Suzuki of the old year and his intention to resign is even firmer today. Stimulated by the Oyama Minister of Justice issue, he will definitely submit a formal letter of resignation to Prime Minister Saito within the day. On the other hand, if Prime Minister Saito has no hope of dismissing the formal resignation of the Minister of Finance, he intends to replace him. However, the reorganization of the cabinet may not proceed as easily as the Prime Minister intends, especially since the military and the Seiyukai cabinet members have already expressed their absolute opposition to replacing the Minister of Finance. Therefore, the resignation of the Minister of Finance makes it difficult for the Prime Minister to clean up the situation. It is expected that the Saito cabinet will still have no choice but to resign en masse at this time.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 8th Japanese Prime Minister Saito Minoru hosted a banquet for the military reduction representatives, Lieutenant Generals Takekawa and Nagano, this afternoon to express his condolences, and went to the Hayama Villa for recuperation in the afternoon, and is scheduled to return to Beijing early on the 10th. He seemed unwilling to speak about the issue of Oyama being ordered to stay in office.</p>
<p>The Kokumin Domei impeaches Saito (Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th) The Kokumin Domei attaches great importance to Prime Minister Saito's request for a decree to retain Minister of Justice Oyama. It issued the following statement today, impeaching Prime Minister Saito, which roughly stated that the Minister of Justice was determined to resign, but Prime Minister Saito believed that it was unnecessary and requested the Emperor to issue a decree, which was an unscrupulous act of evading the responsibility of assisting, and cannot be allowed.</p>
<p>The Seiyukai Temporarily Observes (Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th) Minister of Education Hatoyama visited Suzuki, the President of the Seiyukai, at his private residence at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the events before and after Minister of Justice Oyama submitted his resignation, and at the same time, he had a conversation about the issue of his own advancement and retreat, and left. Then, he visited again at 9:00 p.m. to discuss everything, and it was unanimously agreed that since the red issue under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice has been returned to Minister of Justice Oyama's resignation, the same responsibility issue of Minister Hatoyama under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education is naturally also affected. Therefore, Minister Hatoyama's solo resignation at this time is a useless act. As a result, it was decided that the current cabinet would have to resign en masse in May, so the Seiyukai will not take active action at this time, but will temporarily observe the development of the political situation in a self-respecting manner.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th Regarding the resignation issue of Minister of Justice Oyama, the Seiyukai issued the following statement: It is a matter of course for the Minister of Justice to submit his resignation, and Prime Minister Saito actually requested its return when he made his report. Those who promote the current cabinet's determination to consolidate and cling to power, in our opinion, the current cabinet has completed its mission and is on the path of retreat.</p>
<h3 id="e265">US Major General Proposes Establishing a Ministry of National Defense <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Says a Pacific War is Hard to Avoid</p>
<p>Should Urgently Complete the Five-Year Air Force Plan</p>
<p>Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, April 1st, says that former US Army Air Force Commander Major General William Mitchell, on the 30th of last month, submitted a proposal to the House of Representatives' Army Committee, arguing that the US Army and Navy should be controlled by one leader and a new Ministry of National Defense should be established in order to enhance the performance of US military strength and reduce national defense expenditures. He said that a Pacific war is practically unavoidable. If we want to realize the enhancement of the efficiency of the national army and save more than 250 million national defense expenditures annually, the national defense organization should be implemented immediately. The method is to first place the three armies of the army, navy, and air force under the jurisdiction of one leader and establish a new Ministry of National Defense, and the main national defense issues of the United States should be concentrated in the Pacific, because on the Pacific coast there is a strong and powerful country in the world competing for hegemony, and that country actually holds the ambition of Genghis Khan's expedition, so it will soon conflict with us. Under these circumstances, it would be a great mistake for the United States not to strengthen its air force.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hochi Shimbun reported that US Army Aviation Commander Major General Flourice explained the essentials of the US national defense system at the Army Committee on March 31, arguing that the construction of battleships should be suspended in order to strengthen the air force. His review of the US armed forces was originally an important political program of the Democratic Party during its time in opposition. Now, the United States should urgently change its national defense system and study appropriate measures. All battleships should be stopped immediately. The future policy of the United States is limited to not invading foreign territory. In future naval battles, it is usually within the range of the flight of a base on land. This is what I have learned from my research on the history of naval warfare over the past 300 years. In the past, the emphasis was on defending the inland, but now the strength of the US Air Force is only enough to defend half of the country. Since 1926, the five-year continuous project of strengthening the air force has been approved by Congress. It has been seven years now, but this plan has not yet been completed due to saving expenses. According to the five-year plan, the US Air Force should have 1,800 army aircraft, but the actual strength now is less than 285. If the necessary aircraft that are indispensable to national defense are further reduced in size by saving expenses, how can the safety of the country be guaranteed?</p>

<p>Minnesota's One-Day Tax Revenue is Considerable</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th Today, a newspaper estimated that in Illinois alone, 40,000 people have obtained work due to the sale of beer in the first few hours. The Chicago brewing industry claims that at least five million cases of beer have been distributed to the people in the nineteen states where the liquor ban has been lifted. The government of Minnesota collected 100,000 yuan in beer tax in one day. Former New York Governor Smith, who has always opposed the liquor ban, received a lot of beer today, because brewers all give the first box off the production line to this important Democrat. A German beer expert from a brewery said that the new brew is quite good. Beer prices in New York vary slightly, but on average, a box of twenty-four bottles sells for two US dollars, and each glass sells for about ten cents, while in high-end clubs, hotels, and restaurants, each glass often sells for fifteen cents and each bottle for thirty-five cents.</p>

<h3 id="e276">Anglo-American Conflict and the War Debt Problem (London Correspondence) (March 3) <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>British Chamberlain, in his speech in Leith, stated that at the end of last year, the United States initiated a debt conference. Britain has not yet formally expressed its acceptance of this conference. However, when the meeting is held in the future, it will first put forward two demands: complete and permanent cancellation of war debts and recognition of the Lausanne Treaty by the United States. Regarding this issue, American newspapers have strongly opposed it. The "New York American," under Hearst's trust, made a severe critique in a commentary, being the most intense among the opposing voices. The commentary stated, "Chamberlain's words are simply a disgrace to Britain. Such words should be treated like foolish talk and simply ignored." A certain member of the House of Lords even suggested arresting Baruch, who was commissioned by Roosevelt to negotiate a partial cancellation of war debts with Britain and France, proposing to reduce war debts by 75 percent.</p>
<p>Although the Lausanne Treaty ostensibly "reduced" German reparations to 300 million marks, the treaty also had another provision that the final implementation of the treaty was conditional on the United States abandoning war debts. The most recent payment of war debts due from France to the United States has not yet been paid. Herriot even fell from power because he advocated paying the debt. After the exchange of notes between Britain and the United States in the past period, Britain repaid the December debt, but at the same time declared that this repayment was the last repayment.</p>
<p>The United States feels the danger that debtor countries have formed a united front, with all debtor countries using the excuse that their payment of debts must be contingent on Germany's payment of reparations as the main reason. They also demand that the United States reduce or cancel the war debts owed to it in proportion to the "reduction" of German reparations under the Lausanne Treaty. The United States strongly believes that Germany's payment of reparations has nothing to do with the repayment of American war debts, and argues that the payment of war debts should be based on the principle of ability to pay. In reality, the United States has indeed broken up the | | slowly formed | | united front formed by debtor countries. Britain,</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and Italy have re-acknowledged payment after Hoover issued a moratorium. The United States invites these debtor countries to make individual debt negotiations, giving them the opportunity to partially reduce their debts, as a "reward" for acknowledging payment. There has been no invitation to negotiate with France, which is "defaulting," and Poland, which has not paid its debts on time.</p>
<p>The United States has fortunately broken up the united front of debtor countries, but fierce disputes have arisen in negotiations between the United States and Britain. We have already briefly shown some of these disputes in the press above. For the United States, this is not just a matter of the amount of war debt, although this total is always considerable, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. The demands of the United States go far beyond this. Currently, Britain, France, and Japan have virtually formed an alliance in the Far East, while the efforts of American foreign policy are precisely in the Far East. Due to its isolation, it is greatly threatened by Japanese actions. Therefore, the United States is extremely willing to use this as a powerful tool for its foreign policy. In addition, the United States has also indicated that it is willing to base the reduction or cancellation of debts on an exchange of British political and economic conditions.</p>
<p>The United States believes that these possible other conditions for exchange are, first, the restoration of the gold standard by Britain; second, preferential tariffs for American products in the British Empire market; third, concessions on the issue of armaments; and fourth, diplomatic assistance from Britain exerting political pressure on other debtors of the United States by virtue of British claims or British investment.</p>
<p>The current Anglo-American conflict, due to disagreements on the war debt issue, is almost blatantly exposed. If Britain does not express obedience, the United States will not hesitate to threaten Britain. As a result, British and Commonwealth imports to the United States will continue to be greatly restricted. The United States has already instigated its protectorates to wage war against British forces in South America, and further intensification of American anti-British forces in South America is expected.</p>
<p>Britain is also unwilling to concede and is urgently seeking appropriate countermeasures. In fact, Japan's policy of plundering China can provide Britain with ample assistance. Even Chamberlain's speech in Leith mentioned that, to the extent possible, Britain must increase its exports to the United States or reduce American imports to Britain. Although Chamberlain immediately stated that this was by no means a threat, the American government and public opinion have not changed their opinion of Chamberlain's speech because of this.</p>
<p>The global economic panic, like Germany's payment of reparations, has made it impossible for countries to pay American war debts. The general disastrous fall in prices has increased the responsibility of payment, and the large financial deficits of all debtor countries have made raising funds completely impossible. Even if the debt could be raised, the exchange rate issue would still become an unavoidable obstacle, because there are tariff barriers everywhere, making it impossible to raise the necessary amount. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the United States' withdrawal of its large daily investments abroad. If the United States could implement the heavy artillery to deal with all debtor countries and force them to pay their debts, then the Lausanne Treaty would naturally be cancelled automatically. That is to say, the cancellation of the Young Plan is conditional on the implementation of the Lausanne Treaty. Now that the Lausanne Treaty is invalid, the Young Plan is back in effect.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the entire imperialist conflict, due to the intensification of the Anglo-American war debt issue, has reached a very high degree. Moreover, this conflict is a conflict between two pivotal powers and the main battle line of the struggle between the two powers.</p>

<p>Xu Jiheng, chairman of the Xianyang Relief Association, yesterday submitted a report to the Provincial Relief Association stating that since the beginning of this spring, there has been no rain, and the drought has become more severe. Wheat seedlings and weeds have all withered. In this critical moment for the people, when life and death are hopeless, they want to sell their wives and children to get food, but their wives and children have long been sold. They want to demolish houses and destroy farm tools to make a living, but their houses and tools have long been exhausted. Looking ahead, there is deep fear. At this time of disaster after disaster, when nine out of ten lives are lost, some commit suicide by hanging or poisoning, some abandon their children in wells and flee alone, and some parents starve to death together. Now, death is everywhere, dogs and pigs are fighting for food, and flies and maggots are swarming. Therefore, when entering the territory, there are no traces of human habitation, and withering is everywhere. Even if there are surviving remnants, people are thin and emaciated, living in thatched huts and broken windows, eating tree bark and grass roots. Since the disaster, there has never been such a tragic and severe situation. What did the people of Xianyang do to deserve this great calamity? If no measures are taken to provide relief, I fear that the people of Xianyang will cease to be people, and the county will cease to be a county. Please allocate funds for relief to save lives.</p>

<p>This spring in Fuping, there was a lack of rain, wheat seedlings withered, and drought was widespread. The area of the second district is even more barren and bitter. Therefore, people fleeing to other places are endless. Those who have not fled rely entirely on digging up wheat vegetable roots to survive. Demolishing and selling houses and fields is common, and some even sell their wives and children. Now, the vegetable roots and tree bark have been almost completely dug up, and clothes and property have long been exhausted. Their hardship has reached the extreme, crying for food. How can they survive? According to the current survey, more than half of the households in the entire district have fled, and the disaster situation has become more urgent recently. In two months, more than a thousand people have fled or starved to death, and there are as many as three thousand unemployed. Now, only one-tenth of the livestock remains, and there are more than four thousand acres of wasteland. Even if it rains, there will be no way to plant.</p>

<p>The county is barren and the people are poor, and there are no rich households or big merchants. The residents all make a living by farming. Since the seventeenth year of the Republic, there has been a severe drought every year, and harvests have been poor every year. The people's savings are repeatedly exhausted, and villages have become ruins. Last autumn, there was no harvest again, and this spring, it is not raining, the wheat seedlings are withered and yellow, and there is no hope for the summer harvest. Selling wives and children is common, and suicides by poisoning occur frequently. Orphans and widows wander along the roads, the benevolent pot is broken, and fathers and sons weep together. All these tragic scenes are difficult to describe in detail. Therefore, the county deeply hopes that benevolent people will distribute rice and grain as soon as possible to save these survivors.</p>

<p>Since the 17th year of the Republic of China, Baishui has experienced drought for five years, and the people have been displaced. It is painful to talk about it, and the southeast corner is particularly severe. Last year, not a single grain of wheat was harvested in the autumn. During the winter, people took their elderly and children to escape to the northern mountains because they had no food. Those who remained in their homes were all disabled. To this day, seven or eight out of ten have starved to death. Currently, the sky is still dry, and although there are wheat seedlings, they are all withered and also infested with insects. Therefore, even those who have not died have been eaten. From last October to the present, the turnips have been completely dug up and eaten. Now, all the family property has been sold, and there is nothing to do but wait for death. If relief is not provided quickly, I fear that these disaster victims will also perish.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of spring in Linzhou, there has been no rain, and the land is barren for thousands of miles, and not a blade of grass grows. Now, grains are rarely seen in the market. Wealthy families initially survived on wheat bran, oil residue, vinegar dregs, and wild vegetables. Recently, wheat bran has also become scarce, so oil residue is considered the best. When trying to peel tree bark, there is no bark to peel. When trying to dig up vegetable roots, there is nothing to dig up. Even buckwheat flowers, chaff, and peach bark cost hundreds of dollars per liter. Some have even buried their children alive because they have no way to survive, and some have committed suicide. Those who die from tiger epidemics are also everywhere. In total, the entire county, excluding those who have been burned or infected by bandits or died of hunger, has fewer than 1,500 households of widowers, widows, orphans, and young women and children. Their faces are thin and emaciated, and the sounds of crying for hunger and cold are constantly heard, making the situation extremely distressing.</p>

<p>Disaster victims in Tongguan are gathering and unable to go east. The county magistrate of the county previously drafted measures for leaving the border and submitted them to the provincial government for transfer to the railway bureau for transportation. However, due to the sudden cold weather, more and more disaster victims are gathering. The county magistrate and various agencies fear that accidents will occur, so they raised funds to hire ships to temporarily send the disaster victims east. Yesterday, they also sent a telegram to the provincial government for review. The telegram stated, "The county magistrate is responsible for submitting a telegram on cold days, along with proposed measures for transporting disaster victims leaving the border, respectfully requesting review and instructions, and requesting a telegram to Henan Province to allow disaster victims to enter and pass through the province, and a telegram to the Ministry of Railways to notify the railway bureau to allow them to travel by train. However, the review and transfer telegram will take time, and the number of disaster victims passing through the border is increasing. Moreover, due to the recent strong winds and sudden cold weather, it is impossible to wait, and the demand for transportation is becoming more urgent. The county magistrate and various agencies fear that delays will cause accidents. They decided at a meeting today to have the garrison and local agencies and charities take care of the disaster victims, temporarily sending them by boat to the Shaanxi Prefecture and Lingbao Xiang areas to disembark, so that they can find ways to go east again. They will also conduct inspections during boarding and distribute food appropriately. The cost of this food will be raised by various agencies, merchants, and others. Once the previously submitted measures are reviewed, they will be transported by train. The county government of Guan County and various agencies respectfully request approval (April 3rd)."</p>
<h3 id="e284">Four Provinces Discussing the Aftermath of the Yao Rebellion <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Treat Everyone Equally by Cutting Hair and Changing Clothes</p>
<p>Do Not Differentiate Between Yao and Miao People, Allow Them to Live Together</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The border areas of Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces have always been places where Yao and Miao people gather. Last month, Yao people in Xing'an, Quanyang, Longsheng, and other counties in Guangxi Province were incited by communists to advocate that the Yao King had descended from heaven to revive the Yao and destroy the Han, gathering tens of thousands of people to launch a major riot, which extended to Hunan Province. Yao people in more than a dozen counties in the border areas of Hunan and Guangxi provinces rose up in response, and the situation escalated. Fortunately, the Yao and Miao people did not have many guns and weapons, and the Hunan and Guangxi provinces dealt with them quickly. The Yao King was also captured by the Yongming County team in Hunan, and the remaining crowds fled into the Yao Mountains. However, although the Yao rebellion has temporarily been quelled, if the soothing and aftermath work is not handled properly, there could be future troubles. Huang Xuchu, chairman of Guangxi Province, focused on organizing baojia, making the Yao people cut their hair and change their clothes, treating them equally with the Han people, and abolishing the names of Yao and Miao people in order to fundamentally eliminate the Yao rebellion. In addition to ordering the counties in Guangxi to comply, he also telegraphed Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces, requesting that they handle it consistently to curb the source of the chaos. Chairman He of Hunan Province greatly approved of this and also advocated further planning for the Yao people's livelihoods, stabilizing their lives, developing education, fundamentally eliminating boundaries, and implementing co-residence with the Han people. The exchange of telegrams between the two sides is as follows: (1) Telegram from Chairman Huang of Guangxi: "To Chairman He Yunqiao of Changsha, Chairman Wang Shaowu of Guiyang, and Chairman Long Zhidan of Yunnan: I have investigated that the Yao people in Xing'an, Quanyang, Guangyin, Longsheng, and other counties in my province were secretly incited by communists, first by building altars and offering sacrifices to gods to incite the Yao people, and then by advocating that the Yao King had descended from heaven to revive the Yao and destroy the Han, raising flags and gathering crowds, and rushing out in separate ways to attack Xing'an and Quanyang counties. For a time, the counties adjacent to each other had many followers, and the situation escalated. My brother and Jian Gong (Bai Chongxi) learned from the handling of the Wuyuan Yao case in Guanyang last year that we should focus on soothing and not punish them in any way. Learning from the past, we will start with a painful suppression to deal with this situation, so that they will suffer a heavy blow. Then we will talk about soothing, so that we can promote their awakening and repentance, fear our power, and embrace our virtue, and dare not rebel again. We have ordered the army and militia to cooperate in suppressing them. According to telegrams, the Yao bandits in each county have been swept away by the army and militia. A small number of them have fled to the border areas of Hunan and Guizhou, and the rest have been gradually eliminated. We are now handling the aftermath and have strictly ordered the punishment of the leaders and the dissolution of those who were coerced. At the same time, we are organizing villages and jia, making the Yao people cut their hair and change their clothes, treating them equally with the Han people, and abolishing the names of Miao and Yao people in order to eliminate boundaries. This is the general situation of my province's handling of the Yao rebellion. However, according to reports, the Communist Party's contact with the Yao people in Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces seems to have political implications and cannot be ignored. Although my province has handled it quickly and come to a conclusion, your province has many Yao tribes mixed together, and the Yao Mountains are dangerous. It is inevitable that there will be communists lurking, secretly bewitching people, and acting rashly upon hearing the news. Please investigate and order your subordinates to pay attention and handle it consistently to curb the source of the chaos and jointly maintain border security. Please reply. Your brother Huang Xuchu kowtows. (2) Reply telegram from He Jian: "To Chairman Huang Xuchu of Nanning: I have received your telegram with respect. The Yao bandits in Xing'an and Guan in your province have become a riot and have become an expanded force. My brother and Jian Gong have commanded with certainty and quickly put down the riot. You have also ordered the organization of baojia, cutting hair and changing clothes, and treating them equally with the Han people, which shows your awe-inspiring power and your ability to soothe and govern from afar. I greatly admire you and will comply and handle it consistently to curb the source of the chaos. However, I intend to make proper plans for their livelihoods to stabilize them, revitalize education, and transform their ignorance. Border security is of utmost importance. Please give me temporary instructions. Your brother He Jian kowtows." He also sent telegrams to the authorities in Guizhou and Yunnan, requesting that they handle it consistently in this way.

<h3 id="e291">Sun Ke's Talk This Morning <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>Substantial Rear Preparations Will Allow a Frontal Counterattack</p>
<p>Chiang Has Gone to Jiangxi to Supervise the Suppression of Bandits, Which Should Not Be Difficult to Eliminate</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai this morning with Liang Hancao, Ma Chaojun, Fu Bingchang, Wu Jingxiong, Lu Guang, and Chen Junpu to attend the board meeting of the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Sun this morning at his private residence to ask about the recent situation on the front line. According to Sun, Gu Beikou and Xifengkou have been unusually quiet recently, and there has been no war in the Chahar area. However, the fighting in the Donghai Yangzhen area is more intense. The total number of troops we have on the front line is □□ thousand. Among these □□ thousand troops, in addition to one-third who are not capable of fighting, two-thirds are still capable of fighting. The enemy's strength in Rehe is only about half of the strength of our army. If we counterattack Rehe with twice the strength, and the disparity in the quality of weapons is significant, our sacrifices would be great, but victory would be certain. However, at present, the rear transportation and all other facilities of our army have not been completed, and the rear defense has not yet been consolidated. If we counterattack with all our strength, the isolated army will go deep, and the rear may be cut off. Therefore, at present, our army can only consolidate its original position and counterattack after the preparations are completed. In short, the central government has long been determined to resist Japan and is actively preparing for a counterattack in order to recover the lost territory in the Northeast. There is absolutely no basis for the talk of compromise. Sun then spoke about the bandit situation in Jiangxi Province. Sun said that the communists in Jiangxi Province have been unusually rampant recently. The National Army is working hard to encircle and suppress them. Hunan Province originally planned to transfer □ divisions of troops to the north to resist Japan. However, due to the rampant bandit forces in Jiangxi Province, they will also open Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. President Chiang's trip to Jiangxi is to instruct on the strategy of suppressing bandits in order to eliminate the Jiangxi bandits in the shortest possible time so that a large army can be transferred north to recover lost territory.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Mr. Fangze's Departure from Shanghai This Morning <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>New Voice Society reports that former Foreign Minister Fangze, after arriving in Shanghai on the 31st of last month with the former Vice Minister and members of parliament, departed Shanghai at 10:00 AM today aboard the Dalian Company's steamship "Changchun Maru" for Qingdao. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning, but the departure was delayed until 11:00 AM due to Mr. Fangze waiting for former Vice Minister Iwakura and aristocratic parliamentarian Hashimoto, who had gone to Hangzhou the day before, to accompany him. Iwakura and Hashimoto were sent to Hangzhou on the 6th of this month by order of Mr. Fangze. It was rumored that the person represented Mr. Fangze in visiting Mr. Wang Zhengting, but Mr. Fangze himself denied this, saying he was merely visiting Hangzhou for leisure. Those who came to Huangpu Wharf to see him off this morning included Mr. Fangze's daughter and son-in-law, the Iguchi couple, as well as Japanese Consul Ishisa and Counselor Ariyoshi of the embassy, among others. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Qingdao at 2:00 PM tomorrow, where they will stay briefly before proceeding to Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) for activities, and then to the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>Today's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News reports that the "Beijing Association" organized by acquaintances in Beijing in this city held a welcome party yesterday at 6:00 PM at the residence of Mr. Funatsu Tatsuichiro on Yuyuan Road for former Foreign Minister Fangze, Viscount Iwakura, and parliamentarian Hashimoto, all of whom are old members of the Beijing Association. More than a dozen guests and hosts attended, dining on Beijing cuisine until 10:00 PM before dispersing. It is reported that Mr. Fangze and others were scheduled to depart for Qingdao on the Dalian steamship "Changchun Maru" at 11:00 AM this morning, then transfer to Jinan and Tianjin, arriving in Peiping (Beijing), and on the 15th, take the "Tencho Maru" to Dalian, reaching Fanyang, Changchun, and Harbin.</p>

<p>The Situation Remains Serious</p>
<p>Some Workers Oppose</p>
<p>The labor dispute involving garment workers at the Da Xin First-Class Fashion Company on Fourth Avenue, after discussions between party and government authorities yesterday, was directed for all workers to resume work this morning. The conditions they put forward would be dealt with after examination, and the situation calmed down. Last night at 9:00 PM, the workers held a special meeting. As a result of the meeting, some workers felt that this negotiation was still unsatisfactory and expressed opposition, while the majority of the workers expressed agreement. Therefore, at 8:00 AM this morning, except for more than 50 objectors who have not yet resumed work, the rest are working as usual. According to Gao Depei of the labor union, Jin Tai Xiang has not fully accepted the wage issue, only agreeing to add one jiao (a tenth of a yuan) to the already reduced wages. The workers believe that the company has violated government orders and have negotiated with them, but the employer's attitude is tough and ineffective. The labor union also went to the Yi Xin Fashion Store this morning, which had previously dissolved the labor union in the workshop, for mutual consultation. The employer agreed to introduce workers in batches, indicating that restoring the original situation was not possible, so the situation remains serious.</p>

<h3 id="e302">A Fraudster Who Combined Deception and Robbery <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately Discovered by Yang Xichen</p>
<p>Wei Fugen Sentenced to 30 Days of Detention</p>
<p>Wei Fugen, from Wuxi, yesterday at 11:30 AM on Tiantong Road, colluded with a rogue child named A Qi to impersonate a genuine ring and fraudulently sell a copper counterfeit ring to pedestrians. Just then, Wang Fuzhen, a peasant from Chongming, arrived carrying a cotton quilt, staggering along. Wei immediately instructed the child to peddle the ring to Wang, saying that if he wanted to get rich, he could buy this cheap item, that this ring was worth dozens of yuan but was now being sold for only one yuan. Wang Fuzhen, having just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside, was unaware of the scam and could not recognize the counterfeit. His heart was moved, and he took out a Yuan head coin (silver dollar) from his pocket to buy it. Seeing Wang fall for the trap, Wei approached the child and falsely claimed that he was willing to offer four yuan for the ring, implying that there was a large profit to be made. The child, understanding the signal, demanded the original item back from Wang, who refused. The child then demanded an additional three yuan. As Wang had no more money, Wei mediated, suggesting that Wang pawn his cotton quilt at Hengxing Pawnshop at No. 168 on the road for three yuan to compensate the child. Wang Fuzhen was confused by the gang's tricks, and Wei forcibly pawned the quilt on his behalf, handing him the pawn ticket. As they were whispering in front of the pawnshop, Yang Xichen, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Precinct, passed by and noticed their suspicious behavior. After questioning them, he realized that Wang had been deceived. He immediately arrested Wei, while the child escaped in the meantime. Both the counterfeit ring, the pawn ticket, and the silver coin were taken to the police station. This morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, explained the situation, presenting the counterfeit ring for inspection. The victim, Wang Fuzhen, stated that he had come from his hometown in search of his brother but was cheated by the defendant. When questioned, Wei Fugen's statements were evasive. Judge Wu Zehan sentenced Wei to thirty days of detention as a warning, and the quilt was returned to the original owner.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3 id="e303">The Enthralled by Officialdom Mr. Liang, the God of Wealth <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Zuoyou, who caused a sensation worldwide with the fictitious claim of uncovering the wealth of thirty million from the son of Jie Yuan, earning the title of "Living God of Wealth," suddenly disappeared from public attention for half a year. It turns out the old gentleman was writing behind closed doors and has completed a magnificent work, the "National Thrift and Salvation Plan." Unfortunately, we do not have the good fortune of Chairman Han and Secretary-General Zhang to have a sneak peek at the whole picture!</p>
<p>According to reports, this "National Thrift and Salvation Plan" is roughly divided into "establishing a National Thrift and Salvation Committee, democratically elected members, establishing a National Thrift and Salvation Bank, issuing two hundred million yuan in Salvation Currency." The phrase "National Salvation" appears in every other sentence, proving that Mr. Liang is ultimately a "God of Wealth Enthusiastic About National Salvation," capable of writing such a "three sentences inseparable from action" "National Salvation Plan." Mr. Liang previously boasted in Beijing that "the lost territory of the Northeast can be recovered in one hundred and eight days," so the value of this plan must be equal to the Heavenly Book without Words of the Nine Heavens Mysterious Lady, needless to say. It is no wonder that those who obtain it keep it secret and do not disclose it.</p>
<p>However, is Mr. Liang truly a Zhang Jiao and Zhang Bao, or a person afflicted with mental illness? Certainly not. Listening to his crazy and absurd talk, it seems like he is suffering from severe mental illness, but carefully considering his inner psychology, he is actually extremely "enthralled by officialdom," but unable to achieve it, and thus repeatedly resorts to fantasy, hoping to cleverly take advantage of luck!</p>
<p>Why do I say this? The method for raising funds for the National Salvation Bank in the plan is that each of the four hundred million people in the country has a piggy bank, contributing one copper coin per day, with a two-year term, paying two yuan per term. After ten years, two hundred million yuan can be raised to complete the National Salvation Plan and National Salvation work. Whether this is so easy or not is beside the point, but the five installments of payments would require a total of two hundred million piggy banks. How can they be manufactured in time? And how to account for such a huge expense for piggy banks? Therefore, with such a "National Salvation Plan" of deceiving oneself as well as others, Mr. Liang also clearly knows that it is difficult to achieve practical results, but the intention of the drunkard is not in the wine, but in wanting to be elected as a member of the "National Thrift and Salvation Committee," which must be established first, or the president and other important positions of the "National Thrift and Salvation Bank"!</p>
<p>Let us further examine the use of the two hundred million yuan in currency issued in his plan. Twenty percent is for military expenses for "suppressing the communists" and "resisting foreign invasion," and for "disaster relief," while sixty percent is for "developing industries." The remaining twenty percent, amounting to four hundred million yuan, does not specify its intended use. It is likely that "the wool comes from the sheep," and it is pre-planned by Mr. Liang as the expenses for the two major institutions, the "National Thrift and Salvation Committee" and the "National Thrift and Salvation Bank," or as the cost of purchasing two hundred million piggy banks. If this is really the case, then Mr. Liang, the God of Wealth, clearly possesses the basic skills to become a high-ranking official. From now on, with added effort, it is not difficult to transform from a commoner into a powerful and influential official!</p>
<p>However, those who "hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat," using the banner of reforming society to create a special territory, and using the name of jointly facing national difficulties to hunt for their own positions and wealth, are there only Liang, the God of Wealth, who is "enthralled by officialdom" in the vast land of China?</p>

<h3 id="e304">Oxyhydrogen Blowpipe <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Weiyu</p>
<p>In large ironworks, we often see them use a device with an iron pipe at the front and two rubber tubes connected at the back. The iron pipe emits countless sparks and flames, and when sprayed onto any ironware, it quickly melts or pierces it. How amazing! This is what I want to talk about:</p>
<p>Oxyhydrogen Blowpipe. Before I explain it, I need to describe the combustion process of hydrogen and oxygen:</p>
<p>(1) Hydrogen is a spontaneous combustible substance. It ignites upon contact with fire, and although its flame is weak, its temperature is extremely high.</p>
<p>(2) Oxygen is a combustion-supporting substance. Even a small spark can ignite instantly when it encounters sufficient oxygen. If a large amount of oxygen is supplied during combustion, the temperature can reach over two thousand degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>These two gases can be separately stored in sturdy cylindrical iron containers under extremely high pressure to supply the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the oxyhydrogen blowpipe itself.</p>
<p>The oxyhydrogen blowpipe is made of steel, but the nozzle that emits the flame is made of a heat-resistant alloy. The front is pipe-shaped, and the back is box-shaped, with a tube connected to the rubber tube attached to the hydrogen cylinder. Another tube is connected to the oxygen cylinder via the box-shaped part and leads to the flame nozzle. Because it connects to the flame nozzle, it does not mix with hydrogen before being sprayed out. If hydrogen and oxygen mix and burn beforehand, it will explode, causing loud noises and other dangers! Each tube for hydrogen or oxygen has a valve that can be opened and closed freely.</p>
<p>When in use, simply open the valves. Hydrogen and oxygen are compressed in the cylinders, so when they find an outlet, they quickly escape through the rubber tubes and are separately sprayed out from the nozzle. When the hydrogen is ignited, it burns, and because a large amount of oxygen is supplied, an extremely intense flame is emitted. The temperature is so high that it can melt all kinds of strong and difficult-to-melt metals. It is very quick to use an oxyhydrogen blowpipe to cut steel plates and pierce thick steel plates.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, oxyhydrogen blowpipes and all accessories come from foreign countries. I hope our country can also imitate them to fill the gaps.</p>

<h3 id="e305">Talking About Aviation Saving the Nation <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Xihe Master</p>
<p>The call for aviation to save the nation has been growing louder. Rumors of compromises are swirling, and the storm is gathering. In this critical autumn, we should rely on facts and take the power of the people as a premise. We should not allow people to have doubts and hesitations. Recently, the matter of using aviation to save the nation has been responded to almost throughout the country. Taking Shanghai as an example, businesses, schools, and organizations are all rising up like a storm. However, examining the results, there is a real lack of energy. The busy district and diverse city should have responded to the call, but the results for the past month have not reached even one or two percent. Is it because there is no one to lead the effort, or because the system is not specialized? Things have their own advantages, gathering every bit to make a fur coat, and accumulating sand to form a tower. This is known and believed by everyone, but even many rhinos cannot withstand repeated skinning, and the end of a strong crossbow cannot pierce Lu silk. Comparing Peng Zu and Shang Zi in terms of lifespan, and equating Lou Li with wealth, the rich are just one hair of nine oxen, while the poor are exhausting their resources to search for every last bit. How many people are not trying to avoid and hide? Why do I say that? Let me provide evidence to support my words.</p>
<p>The Aviation Association is responsible for the overall matter, and the Shanghai School of the Education Association promotes its success. There are also local community organizations and institutions. A friend of mine has a family of eight, with two sons and four daughters. Except for the two youngest, who are still in swaddling clothes, the rest are studying at a certain Cantonese school in Shanghai. My friend earns thirty yuan a month. Apart from food, clothing, and housing, the education expenses of his children have become a stretch. Last night, in the rain, he came to borrow money, saying it was urgent for saving the nation. I said, "How strange! You are like Weisheng Gao!" My friend then told me about the donation. As he is a teacher, middle school teachers are required to join the Aviation Association as members, and the Shanghai School aircraft also has the obligation to donate. As he is from Guangdong, the Guangdong aircraft cannot be an exception, and his children also have the so-called minimum donation. At the time, he listed a detailed account as follows:</p>
<p>Family Budget for April</p>
<p>Income: Thirty yuan a month. Expenses: Rent eight yuan, food sixteen yuan, spring school uniform six yuan, Aviation Association membership fee (self two yuan, four children four yuan) totaling six yuan, Shanghai School aircraft donation (self two yuan, two children two yuan and four jiao (tenths of a yuan) and a half) totaling four yuan and six jiao and a half, Children's Army aircraft / Guangdong aircraft, amount undetermined.</p>
<p>According to the above table, my friend will have a significant overdraft this month. My friend said to me, "Save the nation, or save myself? I cannot have both. Which should I prioritize?" I said, "National affairs are public affairs, and personal affairs are private affairs. You are in education and should understand the distinction between the small self and the big self. How can you harm the public for personal gain? You came to my door to borrow money for saving the nation, which is reasonable. I will use my surplus resources to help you in your emergency, which is righteous. However, my situation is the same as yours. I will also borrow from others for this matter. What can I do? Why don't you go home and think of another plan?" My friend remained silent for a long time and returned dejectedly. I also thought with concern, lamenting that it is impossible to be a citizen in a declining world.</p>
<h3 id="e306">The Three Satisfactions of the Japanese <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Boming</p>
<p>The Japanese regard the three northeastern provinces as Manchuria. With tens of thousands of troops, they occupied Manchuria in less than three months, and the whole country is proud and arrogant, one can say they are smug. They also hold Fu Yi and Fu Wei, two or three Manchus, and implement the old tricks of annihilating Korea in the independence of Manchuria. From the above, the Japanese are satisfied, holding Manchus, and occupying Manchuria. The first satisfaction is without dissatisfaction. The book says that satisfaction invites loss, and the Jin people's inscription says that satisfaction leads to collapse. The moon also wanes when it is full, and excessive population becomes a problem. The word satisfaction is extremely ominous, and the Japanese are satisfied, holding Manchus, and occupying Manchuria. How can they not be harmed, collapse, wane, and become a problem?</p>
<p>Geneva Crumbles</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident last year, our country has relied on the League of Nations for everything. The League of Nations is located in Geneva. Recently, the Japanese have invaded Rehe, and the League of Nations is still unable to find fault. Recently, the Japanese blatantly withdrew from the League of Nations, causing us to be consistently disappointed in the League of Nations, and the country itself is quite dangerous. Those who say that Japan in Geneva means that the League of Nations in Geneva will crumble. But I think that the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia is largely due to the tyranny of the warlords, and the internal divisions are quite inconsistent. According to recent reports, Japan's domestic economy is increasingly panicked because of the "Manchukuo" situation of wanting to maintain the illegitimate son of Japan. Geneva means that the Japanese internal will crumble.</p>

<h3 id="e307">Saving the Nation with Imported Goods! <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Leyi</p>
<p>I live in a south-facing room that is spacious, bright, and conveniently located on the dormitory's thoroughfare. My roommates are wealthy students who have endless boxes of snacks and are good at socializing, so many students leave their rooms and sit in ours all day, except when they have classes.</p>
<p>School has started, and our room has become a reception room again. The floor is covered with wrappers from foreign candies and fruit peels. Newspapers with movie advertisements and magazines with nude pictures are scattered on the tables and beds. Sometimes, there are also the smells of cigarettes and coffee, which are strictly prohibited by the school, lingering in our room.</p>
<p>In the first few days of school, there isn't much heavy homework, so our room becomes even more lively, but their conversations are mostly repetitive.</p>
<p>"What did you do for fun during the winter vacation?"</p>
<p>"Nothing but watching movies."</p>
<p>"Did you watch them every day? What did you watch?"</p>
<p>"At least once a day, and sometimes two or three times. I only watch imported movies because Chinese movies lack passion and sensuality compared to foreign movies. They can't arouse my interest. And foreign movies aren't expensive, only one or two yuan."</p>
<p>"Wow, young master! Young master!" The speaker pretends to be both mocking and envious.</p>
<p>"Huh! One or two yuan is nothing. Look at the style of my leather shoes. They're imported and cost more than twenty-six yuan!" A person wearing shiny leather shoes walks back and forth a few steps, saying with pride.</p>
<p>"Humph, what's so special about leather shoes? Look at my suit. It was custom-made at a foreign store for more than a hundred yuan in labor and materials," another person straightens out their brand-new suit, saying even more proudly.</p>
<p>Then watches, pens, gloves, silk stockings, and so on are taken out of everyone's pockets and boxes, and they all say they are imported goods.</p>
<p>Not only in our room, but also in other places, I often hear these kinds of conversations.</p>
<p>"Ah! Saving the nation with imported goods!" This is the thought that comes to me after hearing these conversations.</p>
<p>Young people, we, the young people of this national crisis, should shoulder the task of saving the nation, strive to reach the highest point in our physical, moral, and intellectual development, and use domestic goods.</p>
<p>Now, let's see what our work of saving the nation is: looking at imported goods, wearing imported goods, using imported goods, and eating imported goods.</p>
<p>"Ah! Isn't this saving the nation with imported goods!" I thought.</p>
<h3 id="e308">Third-Class Ward <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Living in this realistic society where economics take precedence, the poor are least able to fall ill. Otherwise, they only have one option: to sit and await death. Naturally, it's not a certainty that once the illness strikes, their life is forfeit, but ultimately, misfortune outweighs fortune. Recently, P fell ill. Although he was a poor scholar, the illness he contracted was a so-called "rich man's disease." He had a high tumor on his neck, terribly red and swollen, requiring surgery to be effective. So, how to pay for this large medical expense became the problem. In the end, he had no choice but to go to the XXXXX branch hospital, established for charity and to care for the common people.</p>
<p>A corner of the third-class ward of the XXXXX branch hospital:</p>
<p>"Thank you, could you change it to some watery porridge? " A weak, trembling voice called out, requesting the female nurse not far from the bed to help him change the porridge. "..." She only gave him a cunning glance, deliberately remaining silent.</p>
<p>"Um, please change it to some watery porridge, can you hear me?"</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Why do you want that kind of porridge? Always complaining!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I want some cleaner porridge. This bowl is mixed with dust and has a bit of a muttony smell. I'm afraid it's not hygienic."</p>
<p>"How strange, you have the nerve to say that. Getting this yellow millet porridge in the third-class ward is already generous enough. Heh, cleaner? Go to the first or second-class ward! Then!"</p>
<p>"Please forgive a poor patient like us, please be lenient! Thank you, please don't keep grumbling!"</p>
<p>"Bah! How much are you paying the hospital? Not to mention the food and lodging. We provide it to you openly. If you don't want to follow the rules here, you can leave the hospital immediately." She said threateningly, "Not long ago, there was another patient just like you, who was kicked out of the hospital by the director. You better watch yourself."</p>
<p>"Nurse, nurse, please come." After P accepted her lecture, she turned away coquettishly. P, still with his humble attitude, hoped for a last glimmer of hope: "Never mind, never mind. But now my head feels very heavy, I have a headache, and pus is flowing from the tumor, please treat it quickly."</p>
<p>"How ridiculous, nurse, nurse? What bad luck."</p>
<p>"Miss Zhang, please forgive me, I was wrong." Pitiful P, while groaning in pain, apologized to her. He quickly remembered what K in the same ward had said: Don't yell at the nurses, call them "Miss" and "小姐," that might be more appropriate....</p>
<p>"Humph, you want me to apologize and flatter you? We are not nurses to be bossed around at will. We are just here for internship from the nursing class. Who wants to be bothered with you people?"</p>
<p>Time flies like smoke, and now it's midnight again. P was in too much pain to sleep. He sadly thought again about the lecture he received for the "porridge" and the "pus flowing from the tumor." He thought silently: This hospital is supposed to be for charity and to care for the common people, how can there be such strange phenomena? Although she is here for an internship, if she learns this kind of skill to deceive the common people during her internship, and later rises to the position of a doctor, alas, I don't know how many lives she will ruin? A burst of teasing laughter came from behind the curtain across the window, and he vaguely saw her and the fat Doctor Huang embracing and kissing passionately. He then deliberately dragged his voice and yawned:</p>
<p>"Damn, what 'Miss', '小姐'? They don't even turn off the lights, daring to play such a trick in front of so many patients, it's truly outrageous!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter? What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Shhh..."</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My three-year apprenticeship has passed (now in the fourth year); but I have not yet received any salary from the business owner, as a sign that he treats me as an employee. I work hard all day long, will there never be any compensation? How disappointing! Because my family is under heavy economic pressure, and still relies on my strength to help them out!</p>
<p>Now I want to ask the business owner to give me a salary; but the cunning business owner, seeing that I often have a dissatisfied attitude, has already made it clear: He says, "It's hard to find a job now, there are people who are willing to work for others for free, without any compensation, just to get a bite to eat, but we don't even want them!" Indeed, it is difficult to find a place to eat now, and he uses this point to make people afraid to complain under his exploitation. So, he usually doesn't allow people to read newspapers or do academic research, perhaps to make people ignorant and let him exploit them! Editor, if this continues, what should I do? I am not that young anymore.</p>
<p>The only solution is to find another job. But I have limited talent and knowledge, what can I do happily and competently? Moreover, I have no connections, and no high school or university qualifications, it's really difficult! Your newspaper's amateur weekly's "Self-Job Introduction" is indeed a life-saving ring for the general public who have no prominent relatives and want to find a job. However, judging from this letter, I don't know if I can do anything else? I also don't know if people like me are allowed to publish it? Please, wise editor, give me an instruction. You are solving difficulties for many people, I eagerly await your reply! Sincerely, Cai Jidong</p>
<p>乂　　　乂　　　乂　　乂</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In this recession year, everyone is talking about "tightening" and "unemployment." There are indeed many people who only want to eat a meal and don't expect to be paid. But capitalists should not take advantage of this opportunity to exploit the poor. You should make full use of your powerful capital to develop your business and accommodate these many unemployed people. We don't dare to sing high-pitched songs and tell you to give away your wealth; but you should know that reducing one unemployed person today is removing a dangerous element from society. They are indeed directly benefiting, but you can also indirectly obtain security. What's not to like about this kind of win-win situation? If you are short-sighted, only know the immediate benefits, disregard the suffering of others, and exploit them blindly, then once it breaks down, the society will be in chaos, and "if the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?"</p>
<p>Judging from Cai Jun's letter (without any changes), the writing is clear and coherent, and the thinking is correct. With your talent, it is not very difficult to find a job. It's strange to say, when everywhere is full of unemployed people, there are many places that are playing the trick of "not using good people"! Cai Jun, you don't need to worry too much, because besides the place you are working now, there are many places in the world that need people!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Ju Fen was huddled in a pile of embroidered quilts, her face as haggard as a flower lacking rain and dew. Her two crescent-shaped eyebrows were tightly furrowed. She gave Wu Yi an unnatural smile when she saw him.</p>
<p>"It... hurts a lot here..." She pointed to her throat with her slender fingers.</p>
<p>"A sore throat? How bad is it?" Wu Yi was almost standing on the edge of her bed.</p>
<p>She nodded slowly.</p>
<p>"Have you seen a doctor?" Wu Yi bent down halfway, the two faces less than a foot apart. Ju Fen slowly shook her left hand, but covered her mouth with her right hand, as if afraid of infecting Wu Yi with her throat ailment.</p>
<p>"I'll call for you!" Wu Yi turned around and left, meaning to go downstairs to call for a doctor for Ju Fen.</p>
<p>"Don't go! Don't go! I'm afraid..." Ju Fen stubbornly objected, because she had suffered enough pain from an illness after giving birth, and she became afraid when people mentioned doctors.</p>
<p>Wu Yi knew that she was very stubborn, so he stopped obediently and thought silently.</p>
<p>"Ah! I'll go buy some medicine for you!" Immediately, he thought of the special medicines for throat ailments, "Hydrogen Peroxide Water" and "Formamint Lozenges." Without asking for Ju Fen's consent, he ran downstairs like a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>The XXXXX Village area had few shops because it was a residential area. There were practically no pharmacies, but there was a car rental company. Wu Yi quickly hired a car and rushed to Nanjing Road as if he were robbing it. He bought a bottle of medicine pills and two bottles of medicine water, and specially brought two yuan's worth of Florida oranges, which Ju Fen loved to eat. He returned in the same hired car.</p>
<p>This was almost the end of the month. Usually, Wu Yi spent money very freely. His wife limited his allowance of sixty yuan, and by the 24th or 25th, it was often used up. Today, he only had eight yuan left in his pocket; the car fare, medicine, and oranges, coincidentally, were exactly used up.</p>
<p>Because he had emptied his pockets, Wu Yi couldn't afford to hire a car as usual when he returned home at half past ten that night. He had no choice but to walk home, and was covered in sweat by the time he arrived. Unexpectedly, this small secret was seen through by the clever and quick-witted Sister A Jin, who reported it to Ju Fen word for word.</p>
<p>"Please take this letter and read it!" The next day, Wu Yi went to the Wang family an hour earlier. According to Ju Fen, the sore throat had been relieved a lot, and he was naturally extremely happy. When he was about to leave, Ju Fen suddenly took out a light yellow envelope from under the pillow she was leaning on and handed it to Wu Yi, but she didn't allow him to open it immediately, asking him to open and read it after he left the door.</p>
<p>As soon as he stepped out of the door, Wu Yi couldn't help but open this mysterious envelope. Inside, there were two ten-yuan bills and a sheet of women's pink paper. There were a few very cursive pencil words written on the paper:</p>
<p>"You don't want me to get sick and want me to take medicine, how can I bear to let you travel back and forth? Smile."</p>

<h3 id="e311">George Raft's Reversal of the Female Crowd (Part Two) <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Rong</p>
<p>After the death of Rudolph Valentino</p>
<p>One of the most sought after by women</p>
<p>Raft was once almost raped by a crazy woman. That erotic woman used the guise of a radio announcer to meet Raft. At that time, Raft was already going to sleep, so he put on his pajamas and came out to see her. Unexpectedly, after the woman entered the room, she suddenly took off her clothes and ran towards Raft, demanding to have sex with him. Raft quickly grabbed a chair as a means of self-defense. Later, he called in his secretary to persuade the woman to leave.</p>
<p>Raft was first troubled by a woman in New Orleans. At that time, a young girl sneaked into Raft's dressing room in the theater. As soon as she entered, she saw Raft and demanded to kiss him. Some people also wrote to him, asking to meet him, otherwise they would commit suicide. Once it was very interesting, a pair of sisters managed to sneak into Raft's dressing room. One of the two women was only seventeen or eighteen years old, and the other was still a child. Unexpectedly, after they talked for a few minutes, the younger one suddenly shouted, "Hurry up and hold me in your arms, it's okay if you hurt me." Raft said, "Your sister is next to you. How dare I?" Unexpectedly, the sister actually said, "It doesn't matter, she's telling you to hurt her, so you hurt her." Raft knew that this pair of women was not easy to deal with either, so he tried to call his secretary to help him out. Things like this are really too numerous to mention. Fortunately, his secretary never left his side. Otherwise, Raft would have been unthinkable.</p>
<p>Raft said, "Married women are the most dangerous." He said, "Any married woman who can abandon her husband to seek another man, is capable of doing anything." Once a woman bribed the hotel manager and booked a room next to Raft's. When Raft went out to perform, she secretly opened his door and quietly entered his room. When Raft finished performing and came back, he saw a woman sleeping in his bed, so he picked her up, sent her out the door, locked the door himself, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>In addition, there were many women who made strange demands on him. Some took off their clothes and asked him to sign their vests; some asked him to draw on their lips; some asked him to kiss her shoulder, and then soak the place he kissed in red as a lifelong souvenir. There was also a wealthy widow in New York who was willing to give him a large house, as long as he lived with her for one month each year. That wealthy widow was very famous in society, and if her name was announced, it would be guaranteed to become a national sensation.</p>
<p>The equipment and furnishings in the theater were damaged due to women invading Raft, which was also a major loss for the theater, but the theater owners took pride in it and were not stingy at all, and asked him to come again. There were also many theaters with poor business that asked him to come once to bring good luck, and the business would be better.</p>
<p>Finally, Raft also has three diamond rings that were thrown on the stage by women: he wants to know their names and addresses so that he can return the rings. (End)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e312">Review of Nagana <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Wanshi</p>
<p>This is indeed a very troublesome problem. When the entire market is declining day by day, if the products of the shadow department still have to try their best to save its business crisis, then it is necessary to find another way and use all methods to find a "way out." But what new tricks are there? Love tricks are not very fashionable anymore, and thighs and sensuality are gradually becoming tiresome. Although beast films were popular for a while, they are almost a thing of the past, and everything is not very prosperous. But in the midst of no solution, we still have to think of a solution, and that is to gather these relatively new methods together to become something that is both love and sensuality, and also has the fighting of wild animals. Then "Nagana" attempts to create a style in such a purpose.</p>
<p>Under such deformed conditions, the screenwriter, in order to have intense scenes of beast fighting, had to reduce many of the love scenes, and the so-called sensuality had to be fulfilled with the black nudity of African natives, plus some hugs and Kisses. Because all aspects had to be taken care of, the result was that no aspect was taken care of completely.</p>
<p>The story of this film is extremely far-fetched: If the doctor is said to have ventured into the interior for humanitarian reasons to treat the natives, but later he did not hesitate to burn villages and release wild beasts to devour the villagers in order to save his lover from danger. According to the story, the Countess is a prostitute, but later she gave in because she could not bear the "pain of lovesickness" for the doctor; not only was there no "middle-of-the-road danger" as in the story, but also in terms of the woman herself, the character was different before and after. I don't know what kind of woman the Countess is at all? Basically, this countess and that other doctor, Stark, have no need to appear in the play. If there must be a story, then such a bizarre and far-fetched narrative that cannot justify itself really makes people feel that American films are becoming more and more hopeless. In terms of performance skills, the photography and lighting are still worth seeing. For example, the beauty of the leaf pattern at the beginning, and the stripes of shadows shown on the screen by the sunlight shining in from the blinds, are all very worth learning. The sound recording is also clear.</p>
<p>The director of this film can be said to have failed. Although the use of the lens was very clever at the beginning. At the same time, when the doctor went to see the Countess, he first came with a delicate voice, like the "reverse board" in this play, to increase the audience's attention to her. Like this kind of emphasis on the female role, she should be given a particularly vivid description, such as becoming a prostitute as described in the manual, but after that she was let go. Especially about her love run, it is simply not described at all, which really makes us confused. Also, the repetition of the woman's terror when she was about to be executed, because it was too repetitive, was not tense but not tense at all.</p>
<p>As for the actors, except for the doctor who can be compared, the rest are mediocre. Especially that woman simply can't act.</p>
<h3 id="e313">Review of "Storm Over Asia" <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Poetry-like sentiment</p>
<p>Novel-like description</p>
<p>Before this article, I feel that it is necessary to say a few words about the title. Although I can't tell the reader how the original title of this film was written, judging from the English translation "Storm Over Asia" and the Japanese translation "Asian Storm", we know that it should be translated as "Asian Storm", although it is not very smooth, but it is definitely not as ambiguous as "Asian Situation". Secondly, this film was once translated as "National Soul", but it has now been remade, and a flag with a blue sky and white sun has been added to the back, tuned like the resurrection of "National Soul".</p>
<p>Everyone knows that this is a world-class film in Soviet films, and also the representative of the famous director Pudovkin. Of course, we do not blindly praise it because of this, but should engage in strict criticism of the work itself. Then, naturally, not only is its intention to represent the voice of the oppressed people, but also in the directing technique, there are many vigorous and very powerful types. Pudovkin is able to express the spirit of resistance of the weak nations in his works.</p>
<p>The Mongolian people, a weak nation, had to sell the animal skins they had worked so hard to get because of disease and for their own survival. However, they are often manipulated in the commercial monopoly of imperialism, so a silver fox can only get a very small price. However, this silver fox is the best gift that the merchant with weapons gives to the commander's lady, although it was plundered from the Mongolian people. They not only plunder in commerce, but also must use force to eliminate the resistance movement of the Mongols in order to suppress the colonies. At the same time, they use their superstition to win over and anesthetize the rulers of the colonies. Not only that, but they also try to take advantage of the feudal forces of the "Son of Heaven" to become a tool for ruling the colonies. In particular, the drama gives a detailed explanation of the imperialists' playing of puppets and the so-called "mutual respect for the interests of both sides" dog-fart treaty. As for their killing and seizing of the Mongolian people, it is simply like a daily meal. But the people of the colonies are finally resisting, and the outbreak of this resistance is, after all, like a storm that destroys imperialism. We see that this is the only way out for the oppressed people, they can only liberate themselves in the vast struggle.</p>
<p>Because of the director's delicate and non-greasy description, the whole rigid evolution is like a skillfully skilled novel. In the part describing the direct revolution in the back, it is like a passionate and powerful poem, even in the static picture, we can hear the tragic roar of thousands of horses galloping.</p>
<p>However, because the director is too focused on the protagonist, he is written as a revolutionary hero. At the same time, it is probably due to the Chinese editing, the latter part is relatively sudden and not very coherent, and the ending is too symbolic. However, this does not detract from the film in any way.</p>
<p>In this film, we can see that the director is very in love with inspiration (lnscsration), but at the same time is very serious about Methode. The same director's representative silent films also include "Mother" and "The Demise of Saint Petersburg", but unfortunately we cannot see them for a while. As for the performance of this film, it is also very good. Other aspects are omitted due to space constraints.</p>
<h3 id="e314">Review of "Sea Waves of Love" <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>LuxuryLlner</p>
<p>The plot of this film is very short, depicting a tragedy that occurs on a ship sailing across the Atlantic. A doctor's wife elopes on this ship, and the doctor tracks her down, securing a position as the "ship's duty doctor." He intends to win back his wife's affections. Before long, his wife and her lover turn against each other. She shoots her lover with a pistol, and then throws herself into the sea. By this time, the doctor has fallen in love with a nurse on the ship, so he does not feel the pain of losing his wife.</p>
<p>There are too many interspersed scenes in the film. The narrated events are two or three times more than the main plot, which relaxes the audience's focus and prevents concentration. At times, the impression is also exceptionally blurred. Furthermore, a major error was made due to the director's carelessness.</p>
<p>In reality, the script itself cannot be said to be unsound, and the meaning is good. It depicts "one wrong step leads to eternal regret" very thoroughly. The acting is also very good, with each actor fulfilling their duty. Good acting can be found in every foot of film. The distribution is very even, but because there are so many interspersed scenes, George Brent, Zita Johann, and Vivienne Osborne are comparatively the best.</p>
<p>Most of the supporting roles are in the interspersed scenes. These interspersed scenes represent the common phenomena in certain environments, and they are indeed very wonderful.</p>
<p>The director has some cleverness, and has fashionably learned many humorous elements.</p>
<p>Although there is not much dialogue, some of it is annoying. The scenery is good, and everywhere is consistent with the scenery one would expect on a ship. The lighting is extremely soft and aesthetically pleasing. Apart from the acting, the cinematography and editing are the best aspects. Many plain performances are made to feel not so plain. The close-ups and camera movements are also worth watching. The scenes of nature where the sky and water blend together are excellently framed. There are not many disjointed parts in the structure. Therefore, from a subjective artistic viewpoint, it should be considered an excellent choice, but in terms of storytelling, it is too convoluted.</p>
<p>The three short films shown with this film are all excellent. In the short films, one can also hear a long singing segment from Chevalier.</p>
<p>If you usually watch too many love films, then this film may give you a refreshing change of pace.</p>

<p>— Lin Qian</p>
<p>Myrna Loy and Mack Cooper are known to be a pair of little lovers in Hollywood. They love each other very much, but they also argue the most, and the reason for their arguments is often jealousy. One day, Myrna gave a chocolate to William Haines, and somehow Cooper found out, and had a big argument with Myrna, which made little Myrna cry. Finally, she gave Cooper two chocolates, and that romantic crisis was temporarily resolved.</p>

<p>"No, Wayne," she faced him. "This is our last night. We must not see each other again."</p>
<p>Dazed and shocked, Wayne looked at her. Finally, he burst out a sentence:</p>
<p>"Emily! You… you don't love me? I've been thinking every day," he stammered, "thinking you would marry me! I was too confident..."</p>
<p>Emily smiled sadly. She shook her head slightly. Gently she said: "I'm so sorry, Wayne... If I had loved you like this when I first saw you... If I had known how sincere, tender, and earnest you were... I would never have let things get to this point... I love you, Wayne... but for nothing in the world, I won't marry you!"</p>
<p>Again he wanted to embrace her, but again she avoided him.</p>
<p>"Wayne, my love... I won't milk cows!" she said humorously, trying to force herself to calm down.</p>
<p>"There are farmhands to milk cows," he retorted.</p>
<p>"What kind of wife do you want," her voice was firm and persuasive, "There are many conditions I can't meet. I'm not worthy to be your wife. She, the girl in the countryside you told me about, is worthy... I know she will definitely be worthy of you."</p>
<p>"But I can't love her as much as I love you!" The young man was very disappointed.</p>
<p>"My love, my good man... Listen to someone with more experience than you, try to believe her... You are a different one among the men I know. I love you... but the first time I saw you, I knew I could never marry you, not even if I die... If we got married, who knows how much difficulty and pain would happen to us."</p>
<p>Wayne was silent. He was struggling to speak, but could not remember anything. This was the first time, crazily and drunkenly, he thought of Irene in the countryside. She wouldn't throw him away like this... He wished he could cry on Irene's shoulder.</p>
<p>He, palely and miserably, stared at Emily... as if she were a stranger. At this moment, he understood that he had lost her... understood that she would never belong to him... Still, everything about her washed over him like a tide.</p>
<p>"What we had before… doesn't that mean anything to you?" he asked deliriously, stretching out his arms to her in anguish. (To be continued)</p>
