<p>時評</p>
<h3>西北亟應注意明</h3>
<p>新疆回漢之爭。已由哈密縣局部關係蔓延至於該省東西南各縣。新疆省府且已遷避。其事態嚴重爲國人所公認。據官方消息。謂事變之起因。一由於新疆省政府招募白俄爲兵。而軍紀廢弛。致惹回民反感再則因軟禁回族八王。遂使民族離心綜此二因。雖不免過於抽象。第吾儕試一回憶張宗昌招募俄兵時代。其軍隊固甚勇敢善戰。惟紀律甚壞。致一般人民怨聲栽道。矧回回民族之爭鬥精神特强豈肯久受暴力之壓迫而不反抗者。益以官吏之貪墨。較之楊增新時代並未梢减。欲圖新疆政治之安定。回民與官府之修睦。焉可得乎。</p>
<p>新疆面積五百三十六萬方里。全省人口。總計不過三百萬。遠道推測。幾視爲荒漠之區。蓋大戈璧橫亘東西。而交通阻滯。近年兵匪縱橫。人更以此爲畏途矣。然新疆藴藏豐富。除玉石金鑛等珍貴鑛産之外。煤炭及鐵鑛。亦隨處有之。天山南北。皆富鑛藏。而煤油鑛之富。在我國境内。實爲第一。至於農産物品。則沿塔里木河流域。類皆可耕之地。其未能發逹者。以人口稀少。一般人民。且不習於耕作故也。是以貨棄於地。而安於簡單生活。有元始時代之風氣。然該省界乎英俄兩大國之間。設使交通便利。幾何其不爲東北三省之續耶。試以疏勒一城論。即可見外人之積極注意。而日夕窺伺其側。正在計算如何下手之方法也。</p>
<p>頃者東北三省淪陷。熱河以隣近東北。雖交通不便亦已爲强敵攫取以去。及至最近。長城沿邊險隘。且入於敵人之手。灤東五縣人民。亦呻吟於鐵蹄之下其影響於華北固甚重大。於整個中國之財政經濟更受莫大之打撃蓋我國對外貿易。腹地各省以迄於津滬廣州。類皆輸入超過輸出。換言之。即貿易上收支。我國實處於劣敗地位。惟東三省則屬例外。歷年皆輸出超過輸入。雖日本在彼金融及産業投資。已超過十五億日金。然東北仍不失其豐富。保持其特殊的優越地位。今旣淪没。何時收回。杳渺無期。在未收回之前。我國經濟上之損失。較諸政權之失墜尤甚。而華北各省。如河北如山東如山西陜西等省。莫不民窮財困。亟待來蘇。欲以之作收回東北之前衛。固屬難能。即以之供給餉需。源源接濟。亦非易事。蓋驅饑民作戰。古昔所忌。况近世民智漸開。民國之民。更不同於專制時代也。是故對於一般人民之生計。不能不急切加以深刻緻密之注意。縱不克一一負担其生活。亦應爲之開闢生活出路。令其自然發榮滋長。然後國家乃得而富。國力乃得而漸充也。</p>
<p>故爲今日中國計。爲收復失地計。尤應特别注意於西北。而以新疆爲根據。以河套所屬爲穀倉。則糧餉有資源。開發得善地矣。五原之開拓。本屬順水行舟。無大困難。只須愼選地方長官。勉爲良吏。使一般社會。漸就秩序。則集約農場之經營。可於最近時期中。收獲最大成果。</p>
<p>新疆在開發之前。猶有一先决問題即從前之稗政。必須改革。而民族間隔膜。亦應除去。否則不能相安。何從求進步耶。我國素習。對於宗教。本無絶對成見。在各個人間。更無問題故回回教在新疆各地。與漢人各個人間。本無大衝突。至於民族間。亦多屬於由政治發生之糾紛。此種糾紛。設使政治開明。即可迎刃而解。是以西北開發。不可再緩。而政治上之新設施。尤爲當務之急。政治上能入軌道。然後經濟建設。方能着手。被處沃野萬里。匪特可以容納幾千萬之移民。而啓其鑛藏。出其農産。足以作收復東北失地作戰之資源。亦足以爲救濟腹地瀕於破産之農村疏解行將窒息之城市。</p>

<p>公報聲明五點獲得諒解</p>

<p>（華盛頓）今日美總統羅斯福與英相麥唐納聯名發公報、聲明兩人對於經濟或其他事件、不論有何同意點、將暫時保留、待世界經濟會議中披露、並謂兩人對於現有之進步、深覺滿意、所談問題包含世界物價水平線、中央銀行政策·貨幣標準·改善白銀地位·及其他有關世界貿易之種種問題、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>美法談話開始</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）傍晚時、羅斯福總統在白宮延見法國代表前國務總理赫禮歐、當率同兩國專家舉行談話、約三小時之久、美國擬在世界經濟會議所提出之技術計劃、並由羅斯福提交赫禮歐、繼又談及軍縮問題、赫氏當說明法國未能接受麥唐納計劃各理由、旋兩國專家相率退出、羅斯福與赫禮歐及法國大使賴蒲萊三人繼續商談、至晚間十一時三十分始畢、赫氏於十一時四十分離白宮而返（五月花）大旅館、並發表宣言、謂羅斯福總統對於世界經濟會議、顯不願其在混亂情形中開會、乃欲制成一種完備計劃、先就數項明確之點、爲法美兩國商定辦法、然後再向他國取獲同意云云、法美兩國專家定於明晨十時半在國務院由赫爾國務卿主席再度集會、至美國技術計劃、法國專家當於明日着手研究、赫禮歐與羅斯福二次會晤之期已定爲星期三日、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）法國代表赫禮歐與羅斯福總統談話内容、雖經副國務卿費利潑斯聲明、謂在專家之前、未曾提及戰債問題、但二氏或已談及此事、赫氏頃向報界宣稱、羅斯福總統所提出關於世界經濟會議之技術計劃、現已交付經濟專家研究、俾作成方案形式、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>經濟會議籌委會定週六開會</h3>

<h3>英美專家繼續討論平準幣價</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）英美專家今日繼續討論平準幣價之要點、外間有雙方對此問題意見參差之說、但當局否認之、聞討論尚未到决定比率之階段、但集中於如何可平準幣價及决定最好比率之方法、據當局意旨、目的不止於平準幣價、但注重世界一般物價之提高、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>坎鈔停兌不啻放棄金本位制</h3>
<p>哇太華坎拿大金鈔停止兌現之閣令、今日已被通過、惟實施日期、尚未决定、據官塲宣稱、此種計畫、僅調節自英國放棄金本位後而起之局勢云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）垣街銀行界認坎拿大停止金鈔兌現之閣令等於坎拿大已放棄金本位之正式承認、衆料坎拿大此舉、將使外人、尤其是美商、收回其現存於坎拿大之現欵、果爾、則坎拿大對於金輸出之限制、將愈加緊矣、此間銀行家以爲坎拿大自一九三一年英國放棄金本位起、早已在理論上取銷金本位、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今晚此間聞坎拿大財政大臣宣稱坎政府暫停以黃金兌付自治領土鈔劵後、大起惶慮、惟因此訊到美已晚、故本日金元匯價未起影響、至此間對於此舉之最初解釋、認爲坎金元與美金元之離婚運動、蓋兩邦金元發生密切關係業已數百年、有時坎金元亦曾因此而遭蒙不利、此時或有使坎金元與金鎊愈益密結之運動、惟金融專家亦有信坎政府此舉爲、安定國際匯兌問題前必要之舉者、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>膨脹運動國會聲勢突然衰减</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日美國會參衆兩院内膨脹通貨運動之聲勢、突然衰减白銀派已决定延緩一切重定幣制法案、以待總統之再行聲請、至其原因現尚不甚明瞭、據聞兩院民主黨領袖信總統與英相麥唐納將可商得美滿之諒解、即日後與法前總理赫禮歐或亦可得同様美滿之諒解、惟白宮方面及曾與國務卿赫爾會議之專家、俱無將白銀另行提出討論之表示、參院白銀派對於總統與外國專使談話之結果、尚不願預作揣　、其他參議員則暗示白銀派或有受紿之可能、以爲總統實係主張完善貨幣者、其要求鑄造銀幣及膨脹金元權力之用意、或者僅在阻止國會之妄動、蓋總統大權在握後、便可限制膨脹恰如其惠之所欲、某議員　謂總統顯作贊成膨脹通貨之勢、藉免渠與他國執政合力安定貨幣時國會内發生猛烈之爭辯而已、雖然目下亦有一種徵象、似美國被迫放棄金本位後、業已披露一種情形、致令國會議員展緩進行其原定程序者、今晨英相麥唐納偕其女公子赴白銀派領袖前參院外交委員會主席波拉之晨宴後、即與美總統繼續談話、而金融專家與經濟家亦仍會議如前、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>共和黨員反對通貨膨脹法案</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）參議院開會、討論通貨膨脹法案、由參總議員湯麥士開始演說、謂世界各國議會提出之法案、從無如此重要者、現有二千萬萬之美金、在若干階級之手、而此種階級、並非以正當工作得之、反之有一種負債之階級、有權得此鉅欵、此次提出之法案、其效用即在將此項鉅欵、由前數種階級、轉移於後一階級之手、蓋此項法案條文、可使銀行存欵人及有息證券之執持人、以此欵移歸公有也、共和黨參議員李特發問云、適所言者、是否即爲通貨膨脹修正案之内容、湯麥士答稱、（若不如辦理、則負債階級不能完全得獲正義）云、當討論開始時、參院銀行委員會主席萊却宣言、渠對於美金貶價條文、原係反對、現亦準備贊成、馬里蘭州民主黨參議員泰定士、附和共和黨反對通貨膨脹案、謂此案一行、則美國必喪失外國市塲、至少將有四百八十萬人爲之失業云、共和黨及若干民主黨議員雖極力反對、至參院似將於今明日之内、通過此案、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英金融界認幣價穩定不可能</h3>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦金融界今日認英幣與美幣之早日穩定、爲不可能事、因適當等價繋於種種要素、而此要素今猶未知也、惟英美談話確似已在原則上解决許多異見、昨日美總統與英相之聯合公報未曾言及戰債、衆視爲可注意事、但預料一星期内美總統對於此事當繼續有言論發表、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>法瑞决維持金本位</h3>

<h3>菲島華僑近狀</h3>
<p>回國華僑范長峰談</p>
<p>航空救國踴躍輸將</p>
<p>日人在菲銳意經營</p>
<p>新新社云、自菲列濱實業考察團抵滬後、各機關團體、均表熱烈歡迎、新新社記者、以菲島華僑情形、當爲讀者所欲知、昨特走訪新自菲島回國華僑范長峯君於全球華僑總工會、承該會總幹事彭燦先君之介紹、與范君詳談菲島最近狀况、茲將談話摘錄如下、</p>
<h3>旅菲華僑</h3>
<p>菲島華僑總數約九萬人、以福建閩南各縣人士爲多、粤僑不過佔十分之三而已、現因菲島土産沙糖椰子焦蔴木材等、價格低落、土人購買力薄弱、故華僑商業、亦受影響、不過以金貴關係、（美金一元換菲幣二元）菲銀一元、常値國幣二元半、故據厦門銀行調查、每年菲島華僑匯欵回國總數、尚能保有相當數字、菲島僑胞、僅有九萬人左右、佔海外華僑總數、不過七八十份之一、但對國事捐輸最爲踴躍、如一二八滬戰、十九路軍在滬抗日時、一月之内、曾匯回八十餘萬、竟佔全部華僑捐欵六分之一、可見其熱心矣、</p>
<h3>南進北進</h3>
<p>日人向外侵略、向分爲南進與北進、北進即經營我國之滿蒙、南進則向南洋羣島發展之謂、然南洋羣島之商權、尚操於華僑之手、故日人處心積慮、用國家之力量、以有組織有計劃之方法、向我華僑進攻、又以歷次受華僑抵制之損失、故於濟南慘案以後、即决定直接對土人貿易方針、並在平日積極準備、故自前年九一八事變發生、菲島華僑、實行抵制日貨後、日人商店、反日見增加、如駕加焉埠、九一八前只有日人商店一間、現在有八間、怡朗埠、前只四五家、現在已有二十餘家矣、同時在華僑方面、則一方面受不景氣之影響、一方面又受日人之經濟侵略、商店倒閉、日有所聞、一盛一衰、情形殊爲危險、甚望我國僑務當局注意、設法補救、否則離崩潰之期不遠矣、</p>
<h3>日人野心</h3>
<p>菲列濱羣島、爲太平洋上之重要島嶼、菲島最南端之納卯埠不過一初開闢之小地方、而日人居留者、已逹二萬人、在該地用土人名義購買土地、表面上名爲經營農業、在該地自建碼頭貨倉、輪船常由日本直駛入口、該埠有建築偉大之領事館、及日本人會、有日本式之花園教堂、積極經營、不遺餘力、現菲人之有智識者、均視納卯埠爲第二之滿洲、以其有軍事上之布置、其野心逐漸暴露、今年菲議院曾通過一案、由菲政府備價向日政府贖回該處之土地、現正在交涉中、</p>
<h3>排華原因</h3>
<p>華人之至菲島、遠在西班牙統治菲島之前數百年、據史籍所載、在十三世紀時、已與菲人交通、故華菲感情、素來親睦、</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>且菲人中百分之七十以上、有中國血統者、近年以來、因菲人之教育普及、知識漸開、我國又内亂頻仍、國際地位日低、故當地土人對華僑多存輕視之心、自九一八事變、以不抵抗而失東省、菲人對華僑益見鄙視、路途相遇、常有駡華僑爲滿洲亡國奴者、更以日人從中挑撥華菲惡感、釀成菲人排華心理、以遂其奪取華僑地位之陰謀、故華僑在菲、常多不平等之待遇、如華人入口、常遭海關留難、拘禁一室、所謂坐水監者、聞去年黃紹雄先生到菲亦曾身受此苦、華僑在海外、受土人排斥、幾乎到處皆是、不獨菲島爲然、此實最足爲吾人海外發展之阻碍也、</p>
<h3>航空救國</h3>
<p>近來航空救國、高唱入雲、海外僑胞、擁護尤爲熱烈、去年冬翁照垣將軍代表中國航空建設協會、赴菲進行會務、在菲時間、不及兩月、各處分會成立者、已有二十餘所、加入爲會員者、約二萬餘人、會費收入、約有國幣二十餘萬元、嗣因總會合併問題、致會務停頓、不然成績當更有可觀也、</p>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<p>關於（農村裹回得去嗎）問題討論函件一束（十七）南京浪仙君來信我們怎様在現狀下發動革命的民族戰爭敬賀劉思民先生讀了尤先生答復雄聲君的信，正想駁他，却有劉先生你的第一封信，使人精神一振，以爲你一定能指出一條正確的光明之路了；但是連讀第二三次的大函，使人大失所望！你一面承認：（所謂農民的痛苦，自然是苛捐雜稅···高利貸的剝削······軍閥官僚逼種罌粟······耕者無其田······）；而一面又相信：目前全國大衆有（民族戰爭，反帝戰爭的熱情），認爲目前是（和日本帝國主義者拚死命的時候）並且期待着：民衆自已起來，實行全國武裝動員······革命的民族戰爭擴大了，民衆的勢力自然也隨着擴大了）；於是，你的解决（中國的整個社會）問題的唯一辦法似乎是（武力抗日）了。這本來是現在最時髦的主張，但是愚陋的我，實在有些大惑不解！誠然，中國是在帝國主義的支配之下，是誰也不能否認的；但是中國還没有成爲帝國主義國家直接統治的殖民地，那未牠們是怎様地支配我們呢？所謂封建勢力軍閥土劣和買辦階級的存在，是什麽意義？···你旣說··（所謂農民的痛苦，自然是苛捐雜稅···）等等，那末爲中國社會基礎的農民大衆旣（能深切地感覺到本身的種種痛苦），那他們就（知道土豪劣紳貪客汚吏是他們的仇人），至於帝國主義是什麽？和他們又什麽關係？在此刻，他們委實還莫明其妙呢！在熱河正要失陷時，路透記者在戰地後方平熱汽車路上的密雲，訪問鄉民對中日戰爭的意見，他們答以：（没聽說那裹打仗），這是最好的證明。這本來毫不足怪，他們只覺痛苦是軍閥土劣所賜與的；至於在這些魔鬼背後的帝國主義者，那除了已經陷敵的東北人民，和外國勢力直逹的大都市的工人店員外，他們没有認識的機會，單靠宣傳是引不起他們注意的。劉先生旣（半在農村裹生長起來）對於這一點，恐怕不會眞的不知道吧！那末，你的見解就未免把本末倒置了。·········</p>

<h3>天氣報告</h3>
<p>徐家匯天文台昨日下午四時三十分氣象預報云、東海東北部及高麗一帶、有和緩之旋風、揚子流域氣壓上昇、天氣漸有進步、全國沿海風微而向不定、恐有重霧、又昨日下午三時前、二十四小時内、本埠氣温、最高六九·一、最低六一·二、去年同日、最高六九·八、最低四四·六、</p>
<p>像尤先生他們那様的辦法眞的是回避現實的幻想，但是你先生這種（武力抗日）運動，我看也不見得高明到那裏去。這種藏在（反日）的（僞裝）之下的民衆運動，一方難得農民大衆的同情響應；他方還一様的免不了受到障碍，這仍舊是左右不討好的辦法。而且這種僞裝）也遮蔽不了甚麽啦！······劉先生，這一點，（我們一定要求你給個明白的答覆）！（十八）本埠章海良來信請問劉思民先生對於中國農村問題應當採用何種辦法來解决？我在貴欄裏看了（到農村去的問題）自從尤懷臯先生勸雄聲君回轉到農村去。一直到今天（十七號）劉思民先生質問尤懷臯行先生及朱天青先生的函件止，引起了我小小的意見，我覺得諸位先生洋洋數千言，從一農村裏回得去嗎）的問題討論到農村問題，一直到國難等等問題。從我的愚笨，腦子裏想這種的討論，對於農村問題一定有正確的解决，甚或至於國難也有相當的辦法，但是一篇篇的看過去，竟使我感到失望！或者其他讀者也感到同様的失望吧？</p>
<p>對於劉思民先生的討論，我不得不佩服劉先生是一個對於現代社會正確的認識者：但是於其二封信中，並未討論到在於現在農村經濟破産下應當採用何種辦法來解决，雖然是約略指出農村衰頽的原因是由於政治不上軌道，（這是我的猜想並非劉先生的指出）。可是始終未曾談到解决的辦法，這是使我感到十二分失望的事情；更加差使我不以爲然的：就是評論尤先的文字如（這種上下不接氣的文字本來就不通）。似乎失去其忠恕之道；（我需聲明的尤懷臯與劉思民兩先生與鄙人毫不相識）。我祇覺得在討論農村問題的當兒，最好討論在該問題範圍之内，何必討論到問題之外？質諸劉先生以及讀者以爲然否？</p>
<p>還有其他諸位的宏論，鄙人確實感到相當的同情，可是我認爲不好過於悲觀，無論任何事體總可以挽救的，或者是可以改良的；卽據現在的農民痛苦如苛捐雜稅的奇重，高利貸借的剝削，軍閥官僚的作惡，無非是由於政治不上軌道之所致；所以想去挽救或者去改良，非設法將政治放上軌道不可，推政治不上軌道的原因，大都是由於四萬萬的（阿斗）太懦弱的原故！要想補救懦弱的毛病，非有相當的組織不妥，我說到這句話一定有人要說我在此唱高調了，可是使農民有組織，並非是不可能，祇需推廣合作社。並將合作社的組織以及設施加以修改，使其不陷以往的覆轍就好了，如此或者能使農村復興也未可知。管見如此，讀者以爲如何</p>

<h3>國花</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>花多麽美麗；以花去代表國家，呌做（國花），尤其美麗可愛了。因爲錦繡河山，好如花一般的美麗可愛，人們没有不變美麗的花，當然要愛這代表國家的（國花）了。從前中國人的愛花，各個不同；陶淵明的愛菊，說是　逸之花；周叔林的愛蓮，說是君子之花；林和靖的愛梅，竟把它當作妻子；皮日休的愛桃，也稱它是個美人。現在人是不同了，利祿薰心，誰不願望富貴，不單是（牡丹花下死，做鬼也風流）的朋友，主張應該把這富貴之花！牡丹！來做國花，反對梅菊做了國花，舉世滔滔，心理大都如此，也可見，我們的（國民性）了。</p>
<p>英國以玫瑰爲國花，法國以百合爲國花，都帶了紀念或代表國民性的色彩。唯有日本，居然把櫻花作國花，島國初夏，櫻花斕漫，他們呌做（櫻花節），非常熱閙。其實，櫻花比桃花還要輕薄，經不起風雨，耐不住寒氣，出風頭的時期很短促，難道這便是暴日的影子嗎？而且他們櫻花，有花無實；有看相，没吃相，這又不是仇貨的徵象嗎？初夏將届，麥秀青嚋，櫻艶紅樹，正是他們得意之秋。可惜一旦梅雨流　，蓮花出水，當然一陣紅去，花落人亡，有誰來葬花埋花呢。</p>
<p>聽說日本人把高梁作爲僞國國花，眞是想入非非。高梁的花，有甚麽美麗，難道可作國花。可是高梁榨起來，可造酒，日本人不是把東三省當作高梁，榨取其民脂民膏嗎？可憐一班僞國君臣將士，天天做其黃梁之夢不肯醒寤，高梁作國花，還不如爽爽快快把（黃梁）作國花吧！</p>
<h3>故鄉</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>近來各種文藝刋物裏，除了（剝繭抽絲）的愛國言論，變相的（妹妹，我愛你）之外，再時髦不過的，要算（歸家○○），（故鄉○○）等一類文章子　　不錯，小子也有故鄉。小子的故鄉，也在這地球上佔到一個相當的地位。小子的故鄉，雖然不是四海聞名的蘇州，杭州，也不是蒙皇軍打出名的八字橋，小塲廟，但是，一様的有人，有狗，有烏鴉，有臭虱，有土豪劣紳，有地痞流氓，有自由戀愛的姑娘，有豐年破産的農人。</p>
<p>小子雖然足有三年不回故鄉了，但樵夫旦旦而伐之的青山，市民們汲飲與洗便桶的綠水，没有嘗到敵人鐵蹄的風味，想來是不會易色的。（一肩轎子當街過，三尺嬰孩亦站班）的五尺寛闊的（大街），想來總還保持着古色古香，（中國固有之文化）。</p>
<p>新學究所說的頽廢詩人所鑑賞的大小土饅頭，想來在這幾年裏，在數量上，當已有了不少的進步。騷人墨客。看了一望無際的（墳墓風光），或許會有（春夜遊墳墓記）等（不朽之作）列入（吃飯睡覺玩女人齋遺墨）裏。現代的未來派畫師，若見了（未亡人掃墓）那一幕，或許可産生一幅（圓錐與曲線），到法國（春季沙龍）去陳列，一定會引起西方人對於中國人，留下一個好印象。</p>
<p>獨輪小車，或許依舊有灌輸文化的無上權威，不，還有航船，可稱平分秋色。打到瘧疾的金雞納霜，撲滅虎疫的痧藥水，都是這種交通利器所給與的恩物　　油頭滑臉的和尚，募化重修的古得墻坍壁倒，尿屎滿地的叢林，或許依舊是（清幽欲絶）呀，故鄉，吾夢寐以遊之</p>
<h3>露營</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>童子軍，我們知道經過英人貝登堡氏極端的努力和提倡，纔從胚胎孕育而墮地了這個名詞；無涯岸的人海裏，便産生了這個忠實的服務者；我們中國的童子軍事業，在目前自然是無可掩飾的糼稚了，然而這兩年也頗呈活躍的狀態關於童子軍作業的紀實有不少人在新聞紙上寫述過，可是它本體極感興趣的無過於春郊的露營了；但是走馬看花般的檢閱，和駐足重樓高宇遠眺一回丘墩般的營帳，絶不能了解它要給予人們知曉的一切。</p>
<p>我曾參觀過女童子軍的營地，伊們利用自然優美的郊野，取經濟簡略不背衛生的圜境事物，供應伊們生活上臨的時需要，就平原高曠，安置營帳，以通風透日避雨防濕爲最高原則；伊們一到目的地，最忙碌的便是工程的搆建了，怱怱的架搭了營帳，其次便是排洩物集中的一座厠所，用着四根童子軍棍子，在距離營帳不遠的一個側面，成功一個立體的方形，外面圍着雪白的帆布，還留着一葉短門，門外積了一堆鬆土，伊們說：每個人大便或小便後，坑間覆上一寸鬆土，是防止木穉香揚溢的，厠所旁邊掘成兩個二尺深的方坑，什麽香蕉皮，瓜子殼，魚鯁，肉骨，都傾棄在裏面，是一個臨時垃圾桶，外面也覆一層鬆土，眞是（金玉其外，敗絮其中）了。</p>
<p>還有藝術化的構造，要算露天的飯廳了，和八仙桌一様大小的一塊地，四面掘成一道壕溝，尊臀着地，兩腿下埀，坐下來恰巧可以容膝；灘上一張鉛畫紙，四角捺着圖釘，遠看起來，是雪白的一方檯毯；如果露營的人多，簡直是都市酒樓的縮影了；伊們樊着青青的樹條，當着筷子，我想起假使和外國童子軍比賽喫飯？包管黃髮碧眼兒要束手無策</p>
<p>長篇小說</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第五回　煮茗度長宵愉懷歲暮　題標抗暴日呐喊聲高</p>
<p>桂枝覺得母親這幾句話，未免說得太傷感了，趙翁是個老古套的人，恐怕不高興，便笑道；老太爺大槪不會在這裏住幾個月就搬的，我們也没有那兒可以搬了走，怎麽明年不在一處呢？趙翁很了解桂枝這幾句話的用意，便端起酒杯子來笑道：但願像大姑娘這様說着就好呵！大姑娘，你不嫌棄和我們這様老古董似的人作街坊嗎？桂枝笑道：這是什麽話呢？像你這様的街坊，眞是千裏挑一，萬裏挑一，也挑不出來的呀！趙翁笑道：那様就好，咱們永久住在一塊兒得了。說着端起酒杯子，向桂枝一舉。桂枝這才心裏一動，覺得自已的話，有些不妙，讓人撈了後腿去。但是人家老人家舉起了杯子，還是不能不理，就也只好陪着他，把杯子一舉喝　了一口。趙翁今晚却是很高興，說了個滔滔不絶，酒也喝的不少。江氏就笑道：老太爺你忘了趙連長臨走說的話啦，酒可以喝，可别醉了。趙翁笑着推案而起，點着頭道：你這是好街坊的話，我不喝了。江氏母女，也就跟着站起來，趙翁紅紅的臉，鬍子半翹起來，他兩手一橫，攔着去路，笑道：咱們事先就說好了，吃光了，泡壺茶，吃年雜　兒，你可别走。江氏看了這様子，趙翁已有三分醉意。醉人是撩擻不得的，遇事時將就着一些的好，便道：好罷，我們就在這裏再叨擾一會罷。趙翁將伊娘兒倆讓到屋子裏火爐邊坐下，忙着泡茶和裝雜　兒碟子，然後在靠遠些的一裝圍椅上坐下來，笑道：我雖然是個老人家，也得講個男女授受不親，要不然，大姑娘不肯在這裏坐着了。吃羊肉，喝燒酒，最容易口喝，喝罷。他幌盪着身體，將鐵爐子上面的頂蓋揭開，將一大錫熱水放在上面。桂枝怕他放不好，站起來要替他放，他連忙攔着手道：剛才你還說永遠和我們住在一處呢，這一會子，你就要走了。（五三）</p>
<h3>車中速記</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>因爲要趁早·車老清早就爬起來·太性急了吧？到了車站，買了票走進火車，坐守了一個鐘頭早知如此又何必起得如此早法！</p>
<p>連天的春雨，已使旅行的人們，不停的在咒詛蒼天，然而在環佈的烏雲中，像要下雨的時候忽然射出了一道太陽光，已使車中的搭客誰都幻現出一種幸運的色彩在面上。</p>
<p>在雜色的行李和旅行用具中，我們可以把旅客作一個簡單的分析！風人雅士，上杭州去遊春；天主教徒到佘山去禮拜；佛弟子上天竺去進香；孤孺孀子回家上墳各有不同的目的，但我是例外了，因爲去望病啊！</p>
<p>一個亂髮蓬鬆的中年婦人，手裏拿着一張寫着幾行字的紙，向旅客訴苦伊我們上次上杭州不是也在車裏遇見的媽又來了，啊也是一技之長，無非是當求乞是賣買，但聰明的旅客也，識破了伊的機巧，誰也肯挖腰包，使伊空走了一遭。</p>
<p>三個青年，忽然挖出了一副撲克牌，在小皮箱的上面打牌了，這也是一種旅途的消遣多少可减少些行車的寂寞吧？</p>
<p>到徐家匯，在月台上，走進了兩隊人馬：一隊是太太兵，掛着黃布袋拿了好多的香燭；一隊是黑衣軍，胸懸十字架手中拿着聖經，人是中西參半，燒香和禮拜，杭州和佘山，又有什麽不同呀！</p>
<p>一對老夫婦，雖然是年過半百，但男的簇新的袍掛，女的是旗袍而皮鞋，在車中密密的情話不減絲毫少年時代的風光祗羨煞了孤獨的旅行者。</p>
<p>松江到了，下車吧？管他！這篇閒賬也同時半途結束吧？</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>能解百種方言</p>
<p>德國言語學者羅泰司博士，能解全世界的國語，計日耳曼系語十種，羅馬系語十一種，斯拉夫系語十四種，東印度日耳曼系語十二種，西印度日耳曼系語四種，芬尼秀烏爾齊安系語十一種，亞西亞系語十四種，印度系語十五種，舍密的克系語十四種，阿非利加系語十八種，南海島系語六種，美國系語四種。以上百四十種國語，羅博士均能隨意談話。有一天他在世界會議時，對參加五十餘國的代表，隨時改變語音，與各代表應答如流，把各代表弄得目瞪口呆了。聽說他亦了解巴士克族的方言，所以大家認他爲全界語學界的泰斗，打破語學的紀錄。</p>
<p>意人的防毒罩</p>
<p>意大利最近鼓吹國民購買防護毒瓦斯用器具，全國新聞，對於廉價出賣毒瓦斯罩的廣告，各地皆然。這是因爲自陸軍總長戈舍拉提出國防問題時，内有令國民準備防護毒瓦斯的提案，就是法西斯蒂主義，有準備戰爭的思想，預先通告國民而起的。</p>
<p>牛與猪的混血</p>
<p>美國新漢布西耶州中的法蘭克商維爾農塲，最近生了似牛非牛似猪非猪一隻怪獸。可是生這怪獸的，是二十六個月的牛，但頭面與尾仍和猪一般的，而身體毛皮足趾，完全像牛，後來經　物學者的研究，認定母牛是與猪交胎的混血獸。</p>
<p>中國蟹到歐洲</p>
<p>我國的河川江海，都有蟹緊殖的。聽說有一種毛蟹，成羣結隊的越西伯利亞，橫斷俄羅斯，經東部歐羅巴，而逹德國的河川。有幾位學者，曾經實地調查，親眼看見蟹羣，越山過嶺移住的。現在全德國，舉行猛烈的捕捉運動，而且有（中國蟹便衣隊侵入歐洲的）警語。</p>
<p>日光與足關係</p>
<p>英國女醫學博士加舍林波甘，近來發表新奇的學說。伊說：常常充分受日光的人兩足，比穿褲没有接觸日光人的足，必定是長的，蘇格蘭人的所以很長，因爲糼小穿着短褲，兩隻脚膀，是充分受太陽光線之故。</p>
<p>法王與葡萄酒</p>
<p>羅馬法王奥司十一世，爲全世界儲藏葡萄酒最多的人。他頂大的葡萄酒庫，都是法蘭西意大利西班牙德意志匈牙利等有名　出産地所餽送，各種葡萄酒，都在三千瓶以上，而且每年照例，由各國貢獻的。</p>
<p>水牛飲乾河水</p>
<p>美國康沙司州的麥克福林中心一帶地方，竟受了幾十年的旱荒，人畜常常爲灼熱的暑氣所害。某日，有幾千匹水牛，突然成羣結隊的，到了司馬克希爾河邊，不到四小時，竟把那河水吃得乾涸，這是一八六六年的故事。現在這地方的故老，有一句（牛飲）的話，比喻人的狂飲，就是出於這個典故</p>
<p>百圓的破鞋</p>
<p>蘇俄因爲物資缺乏，各種商品與日常需用的食物，異常昂貴。所以蘇俄政府，對於普通的物質，都有禁止的價格，譬如舊褲一條，以二百盧布爲限，破鞋一雙，以百盧布爲限，白糖奶油一磅，以十五盧布爲限。</p>

<h3>浙蠶受天時損害</h3>
<p>（嵊縣）各市鄉農民均視蠶桑爲副業、育蠶種桑素甚講求、故繭産尚優、全邑繭行有七八十家、年來因天時不正、蠶繭歉收、農蠶備受虧折、去歲蠶事已退化、今届農村經濟恐慌、購種無資、飼蟻大减、且大半孵育自留之土種、東鄉晋溪·浦口·后山·華堂·南鄉上碧溪·蒼岩·西鄉崇仁·甘霖·北鄉三界·馬岔·石橋·長樂等區、育蠶之家、祇及百分之三十五、收蟻後天氣寒冷、致蠶蟻發育不佳、加以　雨連綿、早帮蠶在二眠後咸起變化、洩黃吐黑、晚帮蠶亦起白僵、傾棄十之四五、現下東南鄉早蠶、將三眠旺葉、西北鄉晚蠶亦起眠、若天時晴暖不變、則春蠶尚有三四分收成、無如乍晴乍雨、蠶户咸抱悲觀、</p>
<p>（新豋）近年來因蠶事不利、今歲雖官廳勸育改良種、奈經濟枯薄、無力購種、是以今届各鄉蠶户孵育之蠶種、土（卽自留之餘杭·新昌·諸桂等種）洋（即製種出售之改良種）分别飼育、而飼蟻大减、爐頭疋口及西鄉一帶飼育洋種者多、三溪鎭港口等處則大半孵育土種、（餘杭種多）天時反常、春行冬令、陰雨兼旬、收蟻不齊、且早蠶在起眠開葉時、因食雨葉、發現腹洩斃者不少、發育不健全蠶、汛早晚相差一星期、前日天轉晴暖、晚帮將二眠起眠、不二日又起陰雨、蠶蟻備受影響、</p>
<h3>英倫茶市突趨活潑</h3>
<p>倫敦電訊云、自四月份以來、疲敝已久之茶市、去路突趨活潑、印度爪哇紅茶、市價均見上漲、三年來囤滯未沽之兩湖紅茶、亦均完全售罄、據一般茶商意見、此次英倫茶市發生變化、頗利我國低莊紅茶、至祁門紅茶、去年英茶商多受虧折、如本年山價高昂、成本重大、仍難遽許樂觀云、</p>
<h3>杭州毛茶開秤價高</h3>
<p>龍井每担開七百廿元</p>
<p>杭州新茶、日來已有上市、西湖龍井茶、每担開秤竟抬高至七百二十元、較上年見高五六十元、其他獅子峰毛峰各種青茶、開價自二百八十元至三百二十元不等、亦較上年爲貴、其原因實由於天時寒冷、出貨不旺、而客帮搶新者多、供不應求所致云、</p>
<h3>温州新茶亦已開製</h3>
<p>温州爲綠茶生産之一區域、去年該路製茶莊號、營業尚稱不惡、是以本年茶商趨之若　、茶號增設七八家之多、穀雨以來各山户均已先後開始採製、惟因天時不佳、採摘不無困難、預料將來開秤、茶價難望减低云、</p>
<h3>糧食米價到稀漲角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨來源以細雨濛濛、到船僅一二十號、市况初市帶緊、後因作客寥寥、遂見呆木、本街去路不多、所幸來源較稀、兼以青島烟台等帮續辦蘇同粳千餘包、惟薄稻僅青角帮二儎、松江一儎、數計三四百包、形勢呈鮮、市價各帮厚粳及薄稻俱高數分角砠不等、回顧今市大局、所能繼高者、以到貨較少、並天雨紛紛所致、杜洋尖及陰變元以本街納胃阻滯、站定而已、</p>
<p>（滬北）各帮來船十七八號、白粳走化因天宮細雨不止、雖有做開、斛出無幾、高貨未開、中次之貨市形稍緊、秈形及白元等均見定勢、早薄稻乏到、</p>
<h3>洋米續有本客暢辦</h3>

<p>客秈閩化甚活、尤以福州胃口最貪泉州及寗波只去江西機晚各二三百包、其他盡爲福州辦去、計開江西機晚九百包、價八元○抂分至七元八角、湖南機紅米一千三百包、價八元至七元八角、又紅糙米一千包、價七元○五分至○二分、福州帮又辦崑山銀條尖穀裹新四百包、價七元五角半、乃係初次試辦也、</p>
<h3>標粉午後步步回落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈盤旋平穩之象、以洋麥報價又漲四五六角不等、業外人心稍挺、計近期好五厘、遠好一分不等、惟因各處銀根不寛、業内外之購買力未能擴大、所以形勢雖好、交易依然不暢也、　至下午開盤、各月份又見步步鬆落、大廠以國際銀市之盤高、已由事實證明、與我國仍爲國際傾銷市塲、暫時亦無可避免、如阿根庭麥昨日喊價、祇四元五角七八分之譜、聞廠家暗中已有成交、故抛貨又見活躍、市勢遂爲帶落、惟因日來天氣不佳、一部份人心尚不肯放鬆耳、結果本月份較前日小七厘半、五六七月份不動、八月份小二厘半、九月份不動云、</p>
<h3>期麥後市稍好</h3>
<p>昨期麥上下午開盤後、大致盤旋、以洋麥報價、雖又好五六角不等、惟以事實上無甚需要、做心思者、又爲環境所限、所以交易依然仍清、上午本月份因交割之故、多頭回出、曾小至四元三角一分、遠期無甚出入、下午因業外略有買進、并以天氣之故、本年國内麥收、恐受影響、人心遂見稍佳、結果本月份較好一分、八月份好一分、餘無上落、</p>
<h3>青中餅暢銷内地</h3>
<p>餅市因陰雨連綿、實銷不易暢旺、零星走化動動、客餅近來推青中餅去路最活、因其身色兩佳、且劃價比較三牌廠餅爲廉、昨統市到四千片如數售于内地帮、價開一元五角八分、</p>
<h3>糖市糖價隨標金再降</h3>
<p>荷赤跌一元有奇</p>
<p>昨日糖市以標金一度跌至九百元、致人心恐慌、市象愈疲、二四號粒砂白公會劃盤雖喊降二十元零三角、仍無成交、號盤有昌興行開出荷赤一千三百十八包、價爲荷洋四元零七分半、（外稅以今日之關金及荷匯合算加稅、計申洋十五元六角、與昨市相較、竟降一元有奇、餘貨均爲交靜乏市、</p>
<h3>五金二百磅馬口鐵缺現</h3>
<p>二百磅正號美馬口鐵、近來現貨奇缺、到貨寥寥、有供不應銷之勢、標準飛黃騰逹、每箱竟能開至五十元光景、比之去年同時橫跳十三四元之多、後市行情或須再漲、</p>

<h3>大觀園的人才</h3>
<p>— 干</p>
<p>早些年，大觀園裏的壓軸戲是劉老老駡山門。那是要老旦出塲的，老氣橫秋地大（放）一通，直到褲子後穿而後止：當時指着手無寸鐵或者已被繳械的人大喊（殺，殺，殺！）那呼聲是多麽雄壯。所以牠男角扮的老婆子，也可以算得一個人才。</p>
<p>而今時世大不同了，手裏拿刀，而嘴裏却需要（自由，自由，自由，）（開放○○）云云。壓軸戲要換了。</p>
<p>於是人才輩出，各有巧妙不同。出塲的不是老旦，却是花旦了，而且這不是平常的花旦，而是海派戲廣告上所說的（玩笑旦）。這是一種特殊的人物，他（她）要會媚笑，又要會撒潑，要會打情駡俏，又要會油腔滑調。總之這是花旦而兼小丑的角色。不知道是時世造英雄（說（美人）要妥當些），還是美人兒多年閱歷的結果？</p>
<p>美人兒而說（多年），自然是閱人多矣的徐娘了，她早已從窰姐兒升任了老鴇婆：然而她丰韻猶存，雖在賣人，還兼自賣。自賣容易，而賣人就難些。現在不但有手無寸鐵的人，而且有了······况且又遇見了太露骨的强姦。要會應付這種非常之變，就非有非常之才不可。你想想：現在的壓軸戲是要似戰似和，又戰又和，不降不守，亦降亦守這是多麽難做的戲。没有半推半就假作嬌痴的手段是做不好的。孟夫子說，（以天下與人易）。其實能夠簡單地雙手捧着（天下）去（與人），倒也不爲難了。問題就在於不能如此。所以要一把眼涙一把鼻涕，哭哭啼啼，而又刁聲浪氣的訴苦說：我不入火坑，誰入火坑。</p>
<p>然而娼妓說她自已落在火坑裏，還是想人家去救她出來：而老鴇婆哭火坑，却未必有人相信她，何况她已經申明：她是敞開了懷抱，準備把一切人都拖進火坑的。雖然，這新鮮壓軸戲垢玩笑却開得不差，不是非常之才，就是挖空了心思也想不出的。</p>

<h3>文人的三迷</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>蒲松齡著的一部（聊齋誌異），洋洋五六十萬言，盡是講些關於鬼狐的奇奇怪怪的故事；而書傳有一世紀之久，婦孺爭誦，堪稱得起中國文學中最流行的一部書。從小兒我便常讀這部書，可是總覺得奇怪，爲什麽一個文人會想出那麽許多奇奇怪怪的離心的事件呢？我斷定這個作者是中了迷；但是我還不能明白，他究竟是中了什麽様的迷。最近又翻閱（聊齋），偶然地我才明白了，他的迷並不單純，可以分爲三種：一曰，色情迷：二曰，財迷；三曰，官迷兼仙迷。是因爲這三種迷作祟，他才寫了這部五六十萬字長的書。在他的書中，這幾種精神都表示得非常明顯。而且這些迷，不只如蒲留仙這様的文人才有，中國大多數的人通通有，所以這部書才流行得長久而廣大。如果中國人的心理不完全改造過，這部書將會流行得更久更廣的。西洋的批評家，解釋人類中無論男女老糼，都喜讀怪異的故事的原因，是爲了其中包含着（驚異的美），這話也許不無道理，但這（聊齋），其所以蠱惑人者，不是這驚異的美，而是這（三迷）心的滿足。</p>
<p>第一，色情迷：一個秀才書生，風流瀟灑，才貌過人，（這一定就是作者）獨坐書齋，覺得無聊，無聊至極，則迷離入夢，一入夢，便有女郎來，注目視之，（容華端正，宛如仙女，）或是（蘭麝衣香，妙好無雙，）或是（鬢低歛霧，腰細驚風；玉蕊瓊英，未足方喻。）其次便是（相將入幃，兩相傾愛，）或是（遺洩淋漓，沾染茵褥）。於是一度春光，數十年不忘，或是到陰司，掘棺材，或是等候着再生，重温舊好，破鏡重圓，逹到目的而後已，這不是色情迷，又是什麽呢？我猜想這位蒲先生，一定没得到美滿的姻緣，自已的老婆像（夜叉），在實生活裏，得不到滿足，而在幻想中去求天仙。</p>
<p>第二，財迷。仙女似的情人都已到手，再迷就是豐衣足食，呼奴喚婢了。自已的情人非狐即鬼，非鬼即仙，神通廣大，想什麽就有什麽，金錢又有何難？如配了龍王爺的公主，一切自不成問題翡翠珠寳隨處皆有；如所愛的是狐或鬼，只要（兩情相諧，則金帛常盈箱篋），而最舒服的是，自已（亦不知所自來）。這不是財迷又是什麽呢？蒲先生大槪是一個窮書生，生活不見得過的很容易，恐怕就連喝酒都不免要當當，於是發了財迷。</p>
<p>第三，官迷兼仙迷。美女的老婆到手，生活也無憂無慮，再迷就是勢力了。在蒲先生那個時候，最有勢力的是作官，不但可以替自已出氣，而且還可以判斷一切世間的寃獄。但我猜想，這位蒲先生是一個仕途不利的書生，恐怕連一個七品的小知縣都没有作到，於是便作（黃粱夢）了，一夜之間入閣拜相，君之下萬民之上了。世間都說（黃粱夢）是諷剌窮秀才的，我看不然，這是他刻薄他自已的。他一定眞的作過這個夢，明說出來不大好意思，只得找一個替死鬼，來代他受過。一再熟讀之後，便可以領悟，那作品不是眞實的諷剌，而完全是由於嫉妬心寫出來的。但黃粱夢究竟不能滿足，反到使他多嘆息幾聲，這眞更使人難過，惱羞成怒，便大駡俗人之利慾熏心，自已想出一個萬世不朽的法子去成仙，在天上俯視着那蠢蠢的萬生，這又何等快樂。於是（八十一歲而終。迨殯，訝其棺輕；開之，則空棺耳）在人世活到八十一歲還不夠，結果還是成仙去了！這不是官迷兼仙迷又是什麽呢？蒲先生號曰留仙，大槪也就是這個意思吧。</p>
<p>並且，由我看來，這部五六十萬字的（聊齋）旣是因爲作者患了這（三迷）才寫出來的：而讀者恐怕也多半是因爲害着這（三迷），所以才那様喜歡讀它。</p>
<p>結論：這（三迷），不只是文人的迷，而是我們中國民族的迷。</p>
<h3>故鄉雜記（續）</h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>先到管墳的家裏，呌他帶着走，因爲墳在半山上。我載了管墳的那頂大笠　走在前面。路慢慢兒的斜起來，就在路旁轟立着幾十丈高的古松，只有在樹頂上有一些枝　底下只是五抱粗的樹幹挺立着。過去一點，有一溜小　，　底的大石　是堆砌出來的，那麽巧妙地躺在那兒，瞧不見水從那兒來，往那兒去，只有一個小石潭，　裏邊是比沙滤水　晶瑩的　水，急急地流着，流到石頭裏邊去似的。水潭那兒再上去一點，是一垛壁立的懸崖，從崖上瀟瀟地掛下一匹瀑布來，布面上開着一朶朶的白花，小水珠噴到空間，就掛在那兒，再也不掉下來啦。我樂得直跳起來，跑到水潭那兒，躺在地上，把嘴伸到水面，那麽貪饞地喝着　水。那晶瑩的水從我眼下流過去，從那透明的平面看下去，只見頂在石子上的氣泡一個個的騰上來。那麽康健的山泉呵！如果是有仙液玉漿的話，那這便是傳說裏的王母娘娘的仙液吧？</p>
<p>再往上跑些路，史是松樹根下生着一叢叢的喇叭花，山茶花了。那淺紅的小花把腦袋伸到太陽光裏邊，微微地張着嘴笑着。我摘了許多花，在帽　上簪了一朶，在衣襟上簪了一朶，也像那淺紅的小花似地，把臉伸到太陽光裏邊，微微地張着嘴笑着。</p>
<p>一道太石砌的懸崖遮斷了去路，拐了個灣，沿着石階走到石壁上面時，祖父的墳在那兒了。管墳的已經放了　子，擺開了酒菜。在墳前拜了四拜以後，我就獨自個兒，從那大松樹的森林中間爬到山頂去。矗立在四面的全是那麽高的松樹，第一次我感到了自個兒的渺小。爬了好半天，才爬出森林，離山頂還有好多路，可是海却已經近在眼前了。站在那兒，我直着喉嚨打了個唿嘯，只聽得四山裏全是　　。在眼下的是那麽小的一塊土地，阡陌全連在一起隔不了半個手指，屋子全像是　蟻窩似的（我是世界的王者呢！）那麽地想着，便哈哈地笑了。</p>
<p>等我滾到山下上船時，已經到了兩點鐘；經過報國寺時，那黃色的古刹已經躱在黃昏的薄　裏把臉塗紮啦。我依舊躺在船頭上，載了一船明月，唱着歌回去，喝醉了似地，因爲月光是頂醉人的酒啊。</p>
<p>第二天，我便扔下了那些送别的人在橋頭，回到上海。再看見沙遜大厦的金頂時，我還像聽見他們在說：</p>
<p>（多𠴰再回來呢？）</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪＮＬＥＳＲＥＮＡＲＤ作林取譯</p>
<p>夢壓　　紅蘿蔔鬚不歡喜那些在他家裏來往的朋友。他們打擾他，佔去他的床舖，逼着他去和他的母親同睡。可是，他日間旣有着種種過錯，夜裏他還有一個重大的過錯，那　是打鼾。他是故意地打着鼾，那是毫無可疑的事。</p>
<p>就在八月間也冷得要命的那間大房子，裏面摆着兩張床。一張是　羣克的，紅蘿蔔睡在另一張床上，在頂裏面，睡在他母親的身邊。</p>
<p>在睡着之前，他在被裏面咳嗽着，把喉嚨弄乾凈。但也許是鼻子打鼾罷？他輕輕地呼吸着，看兩個鼻孔有没有塞住。他練習着使自已不會呼吸得太利害。</p>
<p>可是等到他剛剛睡着，他　打鼾。這眞像是一種僻好似的。</p>
<p>立刻，雷辟克家的把兩個指甲插進他的臀部的最肥處，直到兒血。這方法她是經過了一番選擇的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚的呌聲突然把雷辟克驚醒了，他問道：（什麽事？）（他夢壓着呢，）雷辟克家的說。於是她像奶媽哄小孩子一様，低聲唱着一個好像印度人唱的搖籃歌。把額和膝頂着牆壁，就像要把它推倒似的；兩手蓋在屁股上，掩住那隨着最初一個鼾聲而來的爪痕，紅蘿蔔鬚重又熟睡在那張大床上，在頂裏面，在他母親的身邊。</p>
<p>對不起了這様的事，是我們想像得到的事嗎？這様的事，我們還好告訴人家嗎？别的孩子到了這様的年齡，心和身都是一様的潔白，已經在舉行領受聖體的典禮（ＣＯＭＭＵＮＩＯＮ）了，而紅蘿蔔鬚却還照舊是個髒孩子。有天晚上，他等得太久了，他不敢聲張。他希望在床上扭來扭去，這不快也就會過去的。多麽困難的事啊！另一個晚上，他夢見自已狠方便地位置在一塊界碑旁邊，隨後他便狠自然地，睡得狠熟地解在被窩裏。他醒轉來了。他驚異着，他身邊已没有了界碑！雷辟克家的忍着不發作。她寗靜地，大量地，像母親一様地收拾乾凈。並且，第二天早上，紅蔔蘿鬚甚　還像一個被溺愛着的孩子一様，没有起床以前，就吃着早餐。是啦，有人拿了一盆肉湯送到他床上，一盆精心烹製的肉湯，雷辟克家的用一個小木瓢把那東西滲了一點兒在湯裏面。啊！祇不過一點兒。大哥斐利克斯和姐姐愛勒絲丁帶着一副陰險的臉色在床頭注視着紅蘿蔔鬚，他們都像就要笑出來的様子。雷辟克家的用一片小匙，一匙一匙地　着她的孩子。她對大哥斐利克斯和姐姐愛勒絲丁丢着眼色，好像在說：（當心啊！準備着罷！）是啦，媽媽。（他們老早在想像着他知道以後的怪臉開心着。他們狠該邀幾位鄰居來凑熱閙的。末了，雷辟克家的對他兩個較大的孩子投着最後一瞥，好像問他們道：（你們已經準備好了嗎？）慢慢地，慢慢地舉起最後一匙送到紅蘿蔔鬚那大張着的口裏，直送到他的喉頭，把他餵飽，把他塞滿，於是以一種嘲弄而又厭棄的神情對他說道：（啊！你這髒東西，你已經吃掉了，你已經吃掉了，你又吃了你自已解出來的東西，前天晚上解出來的東西啦。）（我早就猜到了。）紅蘿蔔鬚毫不措意地回答，並没有做出他們所希望看到的怪臉。這事他早習慣了，而我們對於某種事情如果習慣了，便再也不會覺得這事有什麽奇怪的。</p>

<h3>自你犠牲</h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>我嘗聽見好些人在喊着（自我犠牲），我便時常想，這確是句悅耳而又漂亮時髦的話，於是有時我就半意識地，其實是非意識地亦竟學着喊着，原因很簡單，我是。青年，我亦愛漂亮，我更愛時髦。</p>
<p>昨晚與綱談論着某一問題，我又利用着這一美麗悅耳的名辭，藉以爲强有力的理由，於是我連聲高呼着（我自犠牲）（自我犠牲）我還解釋一句，我說，（不犠牲小我，必没有大我）綱說，（自你犠牲）（自你犠牲）你高興，你自去犠牲便了。其實，現實的一切，不是傻孩子們拿（自你）去犠牲，那　玩得這般熱閙？自然花様亦不會愈翻愈新頴，愈來愈流利了。······我聽了這些，我就有些領悟了。；我便想：是的，（自你犠牲）比（自我犠牲）更有道理更有意義，當然亦更漂亮更時髦，而且（自你犠牲），喊出來的聲音也比（自我犠牲）響亮好聽得多呢。</p>
<p>甚麽呌做（自你犠牲）呢？比如你中國，自已不大量犠牲，則我日本那能佔有你東北？有你小百姓犠牲，我少帥便自備得起三發動機的福特飛機，便有那許多金條以供日本人去搶刦，便喪失了老巢，尚有外洋可走；有這一羣一羣一批一批的你來爲我犠牲供我驅策，則此席才得該我主，此威才得該我作；有你吸鴉片，有你設賭塲，有你賣皮肉，則賢能廉潔的我才能藉以爲養命的資源；其他如，有你死才得有我生等等都是（自你犠牲）的眞義，而這些事實又是何等値得歌頌讚美的啊！傻孩子們，你們儘管繼續堅持着你們（自你）的精神而發揚光大吧，事實將帶給你們的當會更熱閙而花様亦必更新頴呢。</p>

<h3>窮病日記</h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>惟團結才足生存　　近兩星期來，閙窮眞閙得厲害可是窮又不只是窮得像餓肚子那様简單，因爲肚子餓，究竟不過只餓餓而已，尚能夠動，有時竟因此一動或許能夠暫時給肚子充實一下，然而窮人的事不但永遠不會如此簡單，實在演出來呌人摸不着頭腦，這兩星期中的病，不是病得太奇特古怪而無可預知嗎？是啊，這是必然的，從此我絶對相信（窮與（病）是相聯繋而不須臾離的</p>
<p>今天下午，英循例來探望我，我眞感激而快樂因爲在異鄉一個孤獨窮病的旅客，居然獲得一個來探談心的故人，這還不夠樂意嗎？　發現　今天精神振作　　多，她說，聽說人猿泰山是一張　人心意而且長見聞的美的　片。主張請我陪她去買二小時的快樂，我答應了她，於是我們就踏進　派亞的台階。這片的劇情很簡單的，但畫中寫自然界的偉大和美麗，眞好像把我們帶往（非洲）暢遊了二小時！</p>
<p>在晚飯桌上，英和我又談到（人猿泰山）；英問我，（（人猿泰山）給了人一些甚麽教訓？）我說（許許多多的人一天到晚都只是在金錢上用功夫，滿腦子的（如何發財？）（如何致富？）一生的生活就埋葬在銅錢眼裹！這眞是世界上最最可笑，最最可憐的一羣呀！你看，（白克）不是滿心眼的（搜集象牙）（發財致富）嗎？結果，終於死生（象牙）埋裹，事實上，他究竟能夠實在佔有些甚麽？</p>
<p>·········）</p>
<p>（你的見解眞不錯；）她很精神地說，（可是還有一點你不應該輕輕放過的，這就是說，處在這只有强權，没有公理的强盜世界野獸世界，弱小者間不相互的團結着，外侮必定層層地踏來而終於爲强者所吃掉！唯其如是，所以（人猿）和（象）雖是獸顃中比較没有（力）的弱者，但　們能堅固地團結着，共力　　，結果（倭人）雖兇而没有組織，終至（倭巢）被象等踏成平地！我國在事實上已是積弱不堪，而國内又是意見紛岐，相互殺伐，必期造成個人的獨尊，什麽東北喪失，平津危急，這不過是一個小小的鞭砲，不足振聾，亦不能發瞶！於是外侮聽之。國亡亦聽之，好在國是大家的，只要無傷於（我的）肌膚就得了。國内如此，總理所謂（聯絡世界各弱小民族）的話，更無需乎提了！······但，不團結，究竟能生存嗎？······</p>
<p>我笑着倒了杯茶端給她。我說，你慢些說，别氣噎了。</p>

<h3>物質不滅</h3>
<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>不知誰人發明物質的主義，給我們愛國的奸商首先運用了，不，恐怕還是不抵抗主義者先享用了罷，九一八後的國難，是愈形嚴重，這是誰也不否認的，不過國難儘　國難，土地給人家佔去，就是（我的就是你的。你的就是我的）那有什麽要緊，况且照科學上物質兩字講，（物質乃空間有形給人認識感覺的東西）土地不是東西麽，大凡東西，都是物質，所謂（物質不滅）誰也不會否認這定義是錯的，所以我們張少帥照物質主義，把東省讀掉了，雖然土地給人家佔去，在手續上不過變更管理，物質終是不滅的，那麽，有什麽大道理呢，他抱了這宗旨，所以錦州失，榆關陷，熱河丢，都是原定的主見，恐怕我們老百姓的責駡，不明白物質不滅，通電報告敵軍如何如何，我軍如何如何，詳細解說，儘可放心，度那苟安的生活，可憐我們老百姓，還不明白他的用意，而義憤塡膺的責駡呢。</p>
<p>這也難怪我們老百姓不明白物質不滅，連堂堂中委張繼先生，和海軍部長，對張少帥古畫的查究，天津海軍醫院的出售，用政府名義來法追，可惜，這物質不滅的定理，都還不知道，恐怕給張少帥要竊笑了。</p>
<p>頣和園的古畫，雖然張少帥經手，不移交於政府，而私自帶走，姑無論出售洋大人與否，古畫終是古畫，不過存放國外是了，那何必查究呢，海軍醫院出售，也是這個道理，明白物質不滅的張少帥，手續一些也不會錯，政府眞是多事。</p>
<p>倒是奸商明白這個主義，把大批的金錢，向外洋流去，愚笨的鋤奸團，用什麽炸彈，恐嚇，一些也不會使奸商心驚膽落，因爲金錢的向外流出，仇人不見得呑下去，終是在流通着，變了銀質金質銅質，那原質仍然在呀！物質不滅，）也是這個道理，誰說不是呢！啊啊，愚笨的國人，聰明的奸商，和張少帥一様的萬古流芳。</p>
<h3>絨線衫</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>當畢業證書得到之後，同學們的臉顔上，無不淨泛着勝利的微笑。</p>
<p>現在他是中學畢業了，他們是有産階級的子弟，自然還要繼續升入大學。萬事只要有錢，這步大學的門檻，自然也很容易跨過。他之所以入大學，不但爲了學問上的深造，並且還附帶着比求學似乎更重要的戀愛問題，仰知事實上他所考入的Ｃ大學，因爲受了戰事的影響，　生眞是寥若晨星，在一搬男生睽　的視線之下。大有（粥少僧多）之槪！　　這裏是離去Ｓ埠要乘念分鐘的小火　才能到逹。</p>
<p>（她眞是一時時代的摩登女性，　她健全的體態上處處顯示着青春可愛！）他把上面的兩句，反復的在默誦，自　的身體也不由主的靠緊着她。</p>
<p>（難道她眞的向我賣弄風騷嗎？放下那付米黃色的手套，隨着取了袖珍粉盤抺粉，擦着鮮艶的口紅。）他又這様暗暗反問。但是，默誦還是默誦，車快到目的地了，畢竟没有機會同她攀談。</p>
<p>（喂！密斯你的手套忘了。）大家都在車廂裏擠着下車時，他拿着她所忘下的手套；當然他不肯讓這個絶好機會輕輕放走，特意飛也似的凑上去呼喊。</p>
<p>（謝謝。謝謝你！她還帶羞似的點頭含笑。</p>
<p>（那裏話。）他見她表示少女天眞的含羞的神態，這一來，自然更鼓起他拿出全幅精神而向她進攻的勇氣：（密斯大槪是在Ｒ校讀書吧？記憶中曾在某游藝會見過的，不過我還没有領教過貴姓？兄弟是劉興邦，也在貴校緊鄰的Ｃ大學。）</p>
<p>（唔。）</p>
<p>（有件鄙事想麻煩　，舍妹志願進貴校唸書，可有什麽辦法呢？）</p>
<p>（恐怕難有圓滿的結果，因爲額數已滿，劉先生！）</p>
<p>（哦密斯的大名尚未請教······　　　（只要在敝校問姓丁的，人家都知道。）</p>
<p>没有經過多少時候，他和她由此就造成了一個戀愛速成的新記錄：　　（喂喂，你是親愛的·········）她對着電話聽筒喜皮笑臉的問。　　　（你給我的信這麽多舍監先生檢查學生的信件十分嚴密，我們以後改爲通電話吧，免得·········）　　　（文藝競選的作題替我撰好了没有？學校定星期四要繳卷的。）　　　（限您明天送來，謝謝！怎？你的羢線衫，啞，剛剛打了四五時長的光景呢，噯啊頭繩不夠，我想再到永安去添購一些。</p>

<h3>博士夫人</h3>
<p>編輯先生：　　我原是一個商店的職員，（九一八）後失業，現在勉强充一個當家庭教師。我的妻子是一個没有進過學校的女子，她對我很忠實，我也很愛她。去年她看見我失了業，收入減少，爲節省開支起見，她離我而歸故里了。她有一個很知已的女友，是一個有經騐的小學教師，因她的遭遇很苦，我的妻子以前常要我替她寫信去安慰她。因此，我們三人都成了知已。</p>
<p>她吾妻的女友的遭遇是這様的：她在師範學校還未畢業的時候，就同一個同濟大學的學生結婚。當時的愛情也很不錯，只是同居一二月就分離了。歐戰後，她的丈夫就赴德留學，當時因他經濟困難，她和她的父親，都屢次替他奔走呼籲，集欵接濟。她所得的薪金，更是凑入匯去。事情眞是奇怪，等他大學畢業，信都少給她了，而且信中文字常有一種厭棄的神情，寫信去催他回國，他說還要研究。待他博士考得，再去催他，他還是借故推諉。她當時已疑心他在外娶了德婦；她的父親也曾致函駐德公使，託其催促回國，復函只說他未歸國的原因，大槪是没有旅費。有一次，他寫信去責問他，并要求脫離，他也置之不理。自此以後，就更少通　了。託人探聽消息，總無着落；一年只一二次信寄家而已。他的母親，已六十餘歲，望眼欲穿，屢次寄信催促，亦無效果。如此遷延，快滿二十年了。她旣未與之正式離婚，又未結識新的愛人，生活異常悲慘</p>
<p>去年吾妻返里，老友重逢，互相安慰，情感愈濃。我妻常託她代爲寫信給我。因此她得窺吾兩人的秘密：非常羨慕！我屢次告以正式離婚，另外結識新愛人。她的回信總說離婚毫不成問題，只是舊禮教的勢力還很大，反對離婚，鄙視再蘸，親友中除你以外，又無别人帮助，我此身已無希望了。這是多麽沉痛啊！我本想於親友中，爲她尋一愛人，可是注意了幾年，還没有尋着一個相當的人。我在這種情形之下，只好寫信去安慰她，說：（我願愛你和我愛我的妻子一般，我們有機會就住在一塊）。平時仍照常各做各的職業，經濟彼此獨立，互相帮助；作一種新式男女結合的先鋒去潤濕她將要枯竭的心靈。</p>
<p>編輯先生，你是人們的指導者。照這様做去是可以的麽？請你切實指示我。</p>
<p>祝你健康張志誠謹上</p>
<p>編者按：這位留德博士，他不回國的原因，雖據駐德公使館的回音，說是爲了没有旅費。但是從他冷待他的夫人一點看來，大槪不出他夫人所料，十九是已經另有新歡了。否則以前的學費，尙且由他夫人等設法張羅；到現在末了一次的旅費，爲什麽反不好意思開口呢他雖說是一個堂堂博士，他的人格，却完全没有了；我們不由自主地要在此駡他一聲（忘恩負義）的東西，並主張要予以相當懲戒。這位博士夫人，應當向法院申請宣告離婚，並保留將來博士回國之後，向他提出損害賠償，優給撫慰金的要求權。除非他甘爲異域之鬼，否則非向他算賬不可。</p>
<p>張君因爲激於義憤，决定去潤濕這位博士夫人將要枯竭的心　，　　是一椿義舉；不過你說你願愛她和愛你的妻子一般，和你們有機會就住在一塊，這兩句話，究何所指？要是你們的結合，不過在彼此帮忙的話，那末也要先商得他夫族的同意，否則不免有（妨害家庭）之罪。萬一你們的結合，不但如此，還希望進而有夫婦的名分。那末在他方面，須將離婚手續辦妥；在你方面，也要商得你夫人的同意。否則（重婚罪）是成立的。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（三十七續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>南京本來有一個號稱全國各大學教授抗日救國協會的團體，伍逸也是常務委員之一；不過在王國楝的事件没有發生以前，他對於會務也不常顧問，至多在宣言通電上簽簽名而已，所以這一個救國協會的組織如何，成績如何，他委實是一槪不知。</p>
<p>（倒是一所很大的院子！）伍逸旣有意要切切實實的幹一番救國工作，當然不能老是在家裏安坐，第一步便决意先上各大學教授救國協會去走動走動，希望能在一個執行委員的權限以内，做幾分實際上的工作。協會的會所是在○○卷十八號，依伍逸的預測，總是和人家分租下來的一兩間小屋子，僅供開會集議而已；那裏知道走到這所在一瞧，恰和他的預料完全相反。原來十八號是一宅新建的小洋房，門上很顯赫地掛着一大方藍底白字的橫匾，此外便没有别的標誌，無疑的，這是一個機關獨佔的塲所了！</p>
<p>走進去一瞧，更了不得，油漆全新，裝璜富麗，要不是門外有那麽一方招牌，伍逸險些要疑心這是一所要人們藏嬌的金屋了。戰說屋子：就有傳逹處，會客室，會議廳，職員辦公室，委員休息室，秘書室，常務委員辦公室，膳堂，·········應有盡有，雖合○大的事務處教務處于一，簡直也没有牠這様完備寛敞！</p>
<p>（你去吧！我没有事，隨便看一會就走了！）因爲伍逸在進門的時候，已在傳逹室裏報了名的緣故，七八個穿白竹布制服，胸前掛着一方有號碼的銅牌的聽差，都知道是委員老爺到了，便很整齊地一起站了起來，祇差不曾向他打扞請安；同時就有一個掛着一號銅牌底聽差，必恭必敬地在前引領着，讓他一路走進去。可是伍逸天生賤骨，却受不慣這様官派十足的趨奉，走過了會議廳，忙揮手把他打發開去。</p>
<p>跨過委員休息室，就到了職員辦公室的前面。辦公室一起有兩間，較小的一間裏面，安着四張極精美的公事檯，和四柄有靠背的大旋椅，其餘的陳設，也比伍逸的校長辦公室考究得多了；此刻，裏面却靜得像没有人一様，伍逸跫過去一瞧，才見有一位年齡跟自已不相上下的老先生，伏在一張公事檯上，努力在研究幸予仁兄的（畫寢學），壁角裏還有一個鼾聲如雷的聽差伴着他。</p>
<p>伍逸瞧他們兩位睡意正濃，未便多留，免擾雅興，忙悄悄地退了出來。（三！三！三！丢那媽！又是三······！）</p>
<p>（好！這一下可着了六三六十八角，加四角一起兩塊一（有　洋嗎？找　！）才走到另一間較大的辦公室的前面。就有一　紊亂的　　和銀元角　相撞的叮噹聲，鑽進了伍逸的耳　中來，使他立即激起了一種好奇的心理，不由不緊行幾步，踏進了這一間神秘的辦公室。</p>

<h3>蘇聯笑劇電影運動的進行</h3>
<p>— 朱逹林</p>
<p>三十二歲青年導演</p>
<p>愛辛斯坦主持其事</p>
<p>蘇聯　是一個善於創造的社會主義的國家，舉凡有益於民衆健康，以至有益於民衆精神的事業，無不極力提倡獎勵。前幾月我們風聞　國内鼓勵作家從事賣劇著述，攝爲活動電影，以資調劑勞働大衆的精神主活，而最近居然着着進行，寗不使人佩服嗎？</p>
<p>此項消息，不僅爲現代電影界開一新紀年，且當此世界各國日就衰落的時候，忽然有這種好現象出現，實在値得我們注意的事情。主持笑劇電影的沙支受辛斯坦（ＳＥＲＧＥＩＥＩＳＯＮＳＴＥＩＮ），還是一個三十二歲的青年。他在蘇聯看作電影運動的四大導演之一。據說他不願掛着空招牌，而即要實地從事創造眞實的生活。個人主義的男女演員，他相信不能適合新社會的要求，故他要爲大衆努力。他的最初成就的工作，是一九二四年出現的同盟罷工一劇。在於這本影品上，他利用大衆的情緒，以訓練演員，獲得額外的成功。其次他主演的尚有ＰＥＴＭＫＩＮ。十月及震動世界的十日。</p>
<p>瑪麗畢克福和島格拉斯范朋克兩人於一九二七年到巴黎，看過他的ＰＯＴＥＭＫＩＯ非常感動。他倆到了莫斯科馬上去拜訪他。</p>
<p>愛辛斯坦有一度赴好萊塢，但因不滿他意，不久即回莫斯科，他那時不僅電影界最活動的　子，且對於電影的理論與實際，均有深刻的研究。他除任了莫斯科國立電影研究所的教授外，復兼做研究羣衆感應的心理與健康實騐所的所長。</p>
<p>他而今進行攝製笑劇的影片，用最精緻巧妙的裝置，以期逹到圓滿的結果。四大笑匠之一的哈寳馬克（ＨＡＲＰＯＭＡＲＸ）最近赴莫斯科和他合作了。</p>
<h3>電影救國會議</h3>

<p>電影界聯合製片籌募（電影號）飛機經費籌備委員會，於前日假大陸商場四樓一清華同學會一，開劇本討論會，是日出席者：計市政府代表朱少屏·沈誥·聯表代表金　宇·卜萬蒼·蔡楚生·明星代表鄭正秋·和合代表王鵬翼·顧文宗·天一代表高天棲·亨生代表·鄭應時·曁南代表仰天樂·謝月笙·月明代表趙箴寳·大東代表　　龔魯蓀·錫藩代表·任錫藩·九時許由朱沈二君招待入席會餐十時餘開始討論各公司劇本，首由鄭正秋講述學生與伶人救國劇情，次由卜萬蒼叙兒童救國故事，繼則蔡楚生講工人救國方針，再由魯蓀叙政界救國策略，仰天樂述軍人救國之準備，謝月笙先生的乞丐救國總動員，趙箴寳說農人救國應具之精神，顧文宗叙說藝術家救國的最後掙扎，高天棲未帶劇本，隨說了些商界救國方法，並提議編製一舞女救國的故事，任錫藩因爲自已不善編劇，願以熱河戰事寫眞一千尺爲助，鄭應時因爲没有基本演員，自動負責拍攝片頭和片尾。</p>
<p>全部共分十二個劇情，經過出席者將每個劇情的不合理處修改後，再討論這十一個故事，將以某項方法去聯串貫氣？結果增感困難，故最後議决由叙述體裁，將每個故事表演出來，收尾要歸納到這次舉行的航空救國的目標上去。　　十二時餘，沈誥囑各代表於三日内將各個本事寫交吳市長看過，並請各代表曁編劇者：附帶着想一個貫串劇情的再好一點的方法，並且每人想一個總劇名，以便確定全片的總名稱。沈君云：（最好是能在五月底以前成功，）</p>
<p>最後：將各項討論完畢，改籌備委員會爲執行委員會，所有各公司代表，（慾）的一幕，被世人忘却的波茜蒂公主對吉普西少女說（你不是妲拉喀挪華呀）。女主角愛蒂琪海妮飾兩個性不同的角色，有驚人的成就，此劇定二十七日在巴黎公映。</p>

<p>那麽這部全影界的導演，演員·佈景師，攝影師，以及各部份人員合力而成的救國片，一定能號召觀衆及有感化觀衆救國的力量的了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>一家六個人的批評　　關乎都會的早晨</h3>
<p>— 湯函光</p>
<p>（都會的早晨）日前在光華開映的時候，我們全家（父親，母親，哥哥，嫂嫂，兩位姊姊和我七人）都去看了。回來後，在晚餐的桌上，每一個人都發表了一些關於這張片子的評論，除一些贊揚之外，底下是一些彼此不同的意見：　　父親以家長的態度，表示許奇齡的不受他眞父（黃夢華）的贈賜和遺産，未免太過分。况且因此而把這位老人活活的氣死，也不是一位好男兒的作爲。因此這一點是頗可疑議的地方。</p>
<p>母親的意思，夢華的情人姓甚名誰，說明裹一點都不提起，是一個漏洞。　　奇齡無辜被捉將官裹去，而編者還給法院開脫，說他的寃誣，因法院嚴密偵查而大白，這顯然是編劇者滿意於現今法院的制度，或是他没有胆量攻撃它，這是哥哥的意見。此外則奇齡在獄中告訴他的妹妹說（我一定要報仇的），但結果奇齡只打了惠齡幾下。這個仇未免報得太輕了。兩個姊姊覺得惠齡一個紈袴子，而竟專心一致的愛戀女工的王人美是不合情理的事；兒子在家裹無法無天，而做父母的一些不加責罰，也是不合情理的事；夢華發覺了兒子的不肖，小張的助暴爲虐，就呌僕人們把它關起來，也是不合情理的事，許奇齡從牢獄裹出來就去救他妹妹，而妹妹却没有問一聲：（哥哥您幾時出獄的？）這也是不近情理的。</p>
<p>致於我和嫂嫂都覺得這張片子是很好的，只是奇齡拒絶夢華的遺産，未免可惜，所以我就說：假使我是奇齡，我一定要收受這份財産了，我何必把這些錢留給惠齡讓他去作惡呢？</p>
<h3>（到上海去）全部拍竣三一公司出品</h3>
<p>— 朱原石</p>
<p>張冶兒王旡能及黃金榮等組織之榮記三一影片公司，借聯華攝影塲拍攝（到上海去）一片，迄今已逹二月，方於前日全部攝竣。並聞不日將在中央大戲院開映，此片全爲勸人識字及勿識字的苦等等云。</p>
<h3>西密地耳眼光不花</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>大導演西席地密耳，年紀雖然大了，眼光却還是不錯。他所選到的演員，没有不會出人頭地的。去年派拉蒙公司發起一個美女賽，結果選出了四個美女。西席地密耳就請這四個美女吃飯。席上他說，（你們四人是從四千人中選出來的我預料你們前程一定很遠大。且等着看吧。）</p>
<p>六個月之後，西密地耳又請她們吃飯。果然他的預言應了，她們每個人都有了長年合同，有了好的開始。般克ＫＡＴＨＥＬＥＥＮＢＵＲＫＥ在（失魂島和（暗殺案）中做要角。派脫麗克ＧＡＩＬＰＡＴＲＩＫ也在同一片中工作。安德賴ＬＯＮＡＡＮＤＲＡ在（神秘騎者）中做領袖。還有海麗亞ＶＥＲＮＡＨＩＬＬＩＡ在（由地獄入天堂）出現過，又在（地線之下）任女要角了。</p>
<h3>安哈婷怕見老頭兒</h3>
<p>— 華明</p>
<p>雷電華公司的安哈婷，她的丈夫哈利白尼司泰，是個年已九十的老壽星。安哈婷嫁給了他之後，被這老頭兒繞得怕了，所以除了在公司裹拍影戲的時候没有方法避去白尼司泰之外，别的地方，處處不同他在一起的。白尼司泰恨極了，立刻同她離婚。但是過後，白尼司泰又很懊悔。安哈婷怕他再來纒，特向雷電華請了假，不知躱到那裹去了。後來白尼司泰各處去探。居然給他找到了，原來安哈婷躱到一家離開好萊塢三十哩以外的戲院中，她從前是這戲院裹的演員，現在重到舊地去，戲院老關極誠招待，並請她演劇，不料白尼司泰這天找到這戲院裹，也進去做主客，安哈婷演劇中間，一見了他，立刻從後臺逃之夭夭</p>
<p>這段東西是譯從四月份電影雜誌ＭＯＴＩＯＮＰＩＣＴＵＲＥ，雖不（肉感）（香艶），但也是講着男男女女的·我恐怕像（統貞）先生那輩道貌岸然之士要引證費他們的心，所以自已在篇末說明·反正是說到女人的都是（在現在什麽時代？）不能做的·末後我希望女人都死光，那麽什麽時代（？）也就不成問題了·不知統貞以爲何如？（文責自負）</p>
<p>（我不說話。反正有了（文責自負）四個大字，編輯先生就好連稿子都不看，隨便地登出來而不必負責了。不敏）</p>
<h3>電影小說忠魂錄ＣＡＶＡＬＣＡＤＥ（八）</h3>
<p>— 訥</p>
<p>當然聽見了打杖，最悲苦的是琪茵了。她歎了一口氣，她說；（無論如何，愛德華是倖免此難了。幸虧他在快活的時候死了。不然眼看　這世界的沉淪，不知還要多麽痛心呢？）　　羅伯聽見了，知道她飽經憂患，不堪再受刺激，連忙跑過去扶著她說；（你何必如此擔心，我們以前亦經過幾次戰事，可是世界亦没有沉淪。）琪茵眼中包了一眶熱涙，她說（我說的世界，是我個人的世界；我的世界，本來是很小的。）這時候的琪茵態度已與前不同，她忽然背城借一地說道；（好！願英國萬歲！使我們常勝不滅！喬易，你雖是一個小孩子，但亦夠掮槍打仗的資格了。我們的生死存亡，就此付諸孤注一擲吧！</p>
<p>大家看了她的態度，都面面相覷，各無一言，而琪茵說定了，瘋狂似的，哭着喊着，上别的房間裹去了。</p>
<p>這様他們全家都加入戰爭了。第一位當然是羅伯，他帶了一旅之衆出發前線。琪茵和瑪格雷亦加入後方服務，做那捲绷帶的工作，一天亦不知要多少里長的紗帶。最後是喬易，他亦脫離了衣頓大學而加入軍隊了。他穿了黃色的軍衣，外貌是雄糾糾的一位青年軍官，但是心中亦明知前途有危險等著他。他於是不能不及時行樂，好將生死置之度外。有一天喬易和一位伙伴，一同跑到一個夜總會裹。那時的　呢，已成了一位紅女伶，盛名洋溢於倫敦人士的口中，喬易初次在那夜總會裹看見了她還不認識。他問旁人那位天仙化人是誰，人家說那就是紅極一時的繁妮勅烈吉斯。喬易聽了，心中一怔。連忙看那戲目單，再仔細認認戲台上的面目，可不是繁妮勃烈吉斯是誰。他驚喜若狂地等到戲完了，就跑到後台去見她。她起初亦不認識喬易，心想這不相　的男子跑到女伶的化妝室，想　他出去。後來經　意說明了來歷，繁妮纔記起小時的朋友來。從此之後，他們二人的愛情亦就開始了。繁妮放棄了許多王孫公子，貴紳鉅商，而專注愛情於喬易一人之身，喬易之艶福可知。惟好景難長，彩雲易散，天公早已注定，喬易之福方濃，禍亦旋踵而至矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Regular Meeting of the Ping (Beiping) Military Branch</h3>
<p>) Beiping) The Military Branch held its regular meeting this afternoon, discussing military and internal affairs. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Retreat of Enemy Troops from Eastern Luan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to observations by certain authorities, the reasons for the recent retreat of enemy troops from eastern Luan are as follows: (1) The situation in eastern Luan is prominent and militarily unfavorable. (2) The Sino-Soviet railway dispute is serious, and troops may be transferred to northern Manchuria to defend against Russia. (3) Alternatively, troops may be transferred to Gubei and Xifengkou to break through the entire line and seize Beiping and Tianjin in one fell swoop. (4) Or, it may be to entice our pursuit to provide an excuse for invading western Luan. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Our Vanguard Forces Approach Changli</h3>

<h3>Armored Trains Arrive at Zhangjiazhuang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo received a report from Shi Tuan this morning that our Zhongshan armored train had arrived at Zhangjiazhuang, near Changli.

<h3>Claim of Recovering Changli Difficult to Confirm</h3>

Starting at 9:00 PM on the 23rd, the enemy suddenly launched a fierce bombardment with heavy artillery, with around ten howitzers and half a dozen more. Our army immediately took strict precautions. By dawn on the 24th, the sound of artillery subsided slightly. Our army took the opportunity to actively counterattack and recovered the Luanyang City position.

<p>(Beiping) Shixia Town telegraphs that after four days and nights of fierce fighting between the enemy and us, the enemy was finally defeated at 5:00 PM on the 24th, and Niangniang Temple was recaptured. The recovery of Gubeikou is promising. The troops rescued more than 500 of our wounded soldiers under artillery fire and are still rushing to rescue more. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our position at Nantianmen is solid. There was no fierce fighting on the front line this morning. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun telegraphs that starting at 4:00 AM this morning, the enemy bombarded our army's left-wing city-breaking position with many field guns. Firing continued until 5:00 PM, but there was no contact between the two sides. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<h3>Our Troops Recapture the Left Wing Heights</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 23rd, the enemy used six airplanes and concentrated artillery fire to bombard our left wing of Nantianmen fiercely. Their infantry, numbering about two thousand, attacked Nantianmen and our left wing separately. Both sides engaged in extremely fierce fighting. The enemy charged forward one after another, engaging in hand-to-hand combat five or six times. Corpses piled up like mountains in front of the positions. The battle on the left wing was the fiercest because a certain height was a strategically important point. Therefore, the enemy spared no major sacrifices and fiercely attacked for four days and nights. At around 10:00 AM, because our left wing suffered too many casualties and was under heavy pressure from the enemy, that area temporarily fell into the hands of the enemy. Fortunately, our side urgently dispatched certain troops to attack, charging five times and defeating the enemy at around 12:00 PM, recapturing the area. In this battle, our side suffered injuries to three battalion commanders, Ji Weipei, Chen Jiazuo, and Zhou Guibin, and battalion commanders Nie Xin and Wu Chaozheng were killed in action.

<h3>President Wang Reports on National Affairs</h3>
<p>Hoping that Hu Hanmin Will Come to Consult on the Provisional National Assembly Issue</p>
<p>Senior Officials Have Been Sent to Handle the Xinjiang Incident</p>
<p>The Reorganization of the Gansu Provincial Government Will Still Be Headed by a Civilian Official</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei made the following important statement to reporters today:</p>
<p>(1) The southwest's opposition to the central government's convocation of a provisional national assembly on July 1st stems from a misunderstanding. The central government has repeatedly telegraphed explanations, but despite repeated consultations through telegrams, there are still difficulties in explaining the matter. Therefore, the central government and all parties have telegraphed Mr. Hu Hanmin, requesting him to come north for consultation. It would be good if Hu comes to Shanghai, and even better if he comes to Nanjing. Although Hu has not expressed any intention, the central government believes that Hu will come to Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<p>(2) I have just received a telegram from Xinjiang stating that the Hui people have occupied the Xinjiang provincial government and overthrown Jin Shuren. However, the Hui people have stated that they are not betraying the country or the central laws and regulations, but are opposing Jin's personal issues. (Wang declared at this point that he was speaking responsibly.) They are still obedient to the central government. The central government is currently selecting senior officials to prepare to go there to handle the matter. The candidates have already been decided, and they will be officially announced after their consent is obtained.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the improvement of the North China administrative system, there are currently two proposals. One is that the situation in North China is serious and requires the establishment of a well-organized administrative organ. Although several consultations have been held, this matter is of great importance, and the Executive Yuan has no right to discuss it. It should be discussed and decided by the Central Political Council.</p>
<p>(4) Whether to reorganize the Gansu provincial government has not yet been decided. The consent of Chairman Shao must be obtained in advance. Rumors that the central government will send troops there are absolutely untrue. In the future reorganization, the central government will definitely not appoint a military officer to govern Gansu. A civilian with high talent and learning must be sent to preside over it.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the rural relief plan, although the Ministry of Industry has drafted an implementation plan, it must be consulted and handled jointly with the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the Executive Yuan meeting today failed to make a formal decision. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops Recover Fengning</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops recently attacked Fengning and recovered it yesterday. It is rumored that the enemy troops, fearing that their retreat route would be cut off, have begun preparations to retreat with their troops in Gubeikou and Xifengkou. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Five Thousand Volunteer Troops Lurk in the Eastern Border of Liaoning</h3>
<p>Yu Zhishan's Troops Go to Shancheng to Attack</p>
<p>(Beiping) Up to 50,000 volunteer troops are lurking in the eastern border area of Liaoning, planning to take action when the green crops provide cover. The Japanese and puppet authorities, in order to prevent the activities of the volunteer army, have decided to fundamentally eliminate them. Anti-Manchu volunteer armies and reorganized troops in Tonghua, Hailong, and Huinan counties, such as Wang Fengge and Zhang Chunsheng, who have unclear attitudes, are actively contacting each other. Puppet army Yu Zhishan led his troops to Shancheng Town on the 17th of this month to attack the volunteer army, with Yu Zhi's subordinate troops serving as the main force, and the aviation team dispatched by the Kwantung Province assisted in the operation.

<h3>Li Jishen Urges the Generals of Three Provinces to Lead Troops North to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Jishen telegraphed Li Zongren, Chen Jitang, Cai Tingkai, Bai Chongxi, Miao Peinan, Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, Li Yangjing, etc. on the 24th, stating that since the September 18th Incident, more than a year has passed, and four provinces have been lost. The authorities have been unable to resist the enemy with their defending troops in the front, nor have they been able to defend with the entire nation in the rear. It is most heartbreaking that the people's enthusiasm for defending the country is gradually declining. The provincial governors who possess troops regard the encroachment of the strong enemy and the loss of territory as if the people of Qin regarded the fat and lean of the people of Yue. Is it because of the immorality of the supreme ruler, that those who possess troops only know how to protect their own territory? This is most shameful for the soldiers of the whole country. Jishen came south last year, thinking that the southwest, as the cradle of the revolution, would surely bear the great responsibility of resisting Japan and dispatching troops. However, you, brothers, have held several consultations on dispatching troops, but you have too many concerns and are too cautious. From beginning to end, only Xianchu alone has strived to take the lead. Although the slogan of resisting Japan has been repeatedly proclaimed, it has not been put into practice. Recently, there has even been a fixed decision not to dispatch troops, which is especially disappointing for the people of the country. I believe that the national situation has deteriorated to this point, and North China and South China are both in imminent danger. This is truly the time for the soldiers of the whole country to risk their lives in times of danger. Only by exerting all their strength and running to the front lines can you, brothers, fulfill your heavenly duty as commanders. If you continue to live in peace and draw boundaries to defend yourselves, the country will not be a country in the end. What will there be for the provinces? How can you forget the suffering of a hundred generations for the sake of one's own selfish thoughts? Your brother is willing for you, brothers, to be good men, to be like Kemal, to lead a large army north to resist Japan, and to be a champion for the world. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>Drastic Changes in the Political Situation in Xinjiang</p>
<p>Rumor that Jin Shuren's Regime Has Been Overthrown</p>
<p>The Central Government Decides on Three Measures to Handle the Situation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xinjiang incident has expanded. Government sources received unofficial news today that the Hui people have entered the provincial capital, and Jin Shuren has been overthrown. The Hui people have expressed their support for the central government. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person said that three measures have been internally decided to deal with the new chaos: (1) Dispatch senior officials to stabilize the hearts of the Hui people. (2) The troops of Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan, who have retreated into Russian territory, number more than ten thousand. They have now successively returned to Xinjiang and will be stationed there in the future, under the command of senior officials from the central government. They will not participate in the war against Japan and will be purely for the nature of provincial defense forces. At the same time, negotiations will be held with Russia to return the previously confiscated weapons for the purpose of maintaining public security in Xinjiang. (3) Disarm the White Russian troops currently in Xinjiang to avoid resentment from the Hui people and to prevent the situation from escalating. The candidates for the senior officials to be dispatched should be decided soon. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to another source, when the White Russians of the 1917 Russian Revolution retreated and gathered in Outer Mongolia, they plotted rebellion, fought with the Chinese army, and organized a White Russian government. They were previously attacked by the Russian army and were utterly defeated and dispersed. Some retreated into the three northeastern provinces and are now being used by the Japanese army to invade China, while others retreated into Xinjiang to live and were reorganized into the army by the new provincial authorities. However, they maintained communication with the White Russians in Manchuria. After the Northeast Incident, the White Russians in Xinjiang also secretly plotted a change, which led to the opposition of the Hui people. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<h3>President Wang Convenes the First Meeting of the Rural Reconstruction Committee on May 5th in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang reported at yesterday's Executive Yuan meeting that after soliciting the list of members for the establishment of the Rural Reconstruction Committee, a circular was issued, setting the date for the first meeting of the committee and requesting the members to attend at that time. The original text of the circular is as follows (abbreviated): "Our country's rural areas are dilapidated, and production is declining. In Jiangxi and Hubei, bandits are rampant, while in Shaanxi and Gansu, there are thousands of miles of red land, and the ditches and gullies are full of people struggling to survive, which is too horrible to bear. To resist Japan with this situation is not enough strength, and to suppress bandits with this situation is difficult to eradicate. It is now proposed to establish a Rural Reconstruction Committee in the Executive Yuan to concentrate the power of the government and the people, raise large sums of money, provide relief in various ways, strengthen finance, improve technology, develop transportation, and regulate grain supplies, in order to consolidate the rear area for resisting Japan and achieve the effect of cutting off the bandits' roots. At today's Executive Yuan meeting, it was decided to invite you, sir, to be a member and to hold the first meeting in Nanjing on May 5th. We hope that you will not abandon us and will be willing to come and help us find a fundamental solution to save the people from their plight. We respectfully request the people to do so.

<p>(Nanjing) As all parties are negotiating to cancel the Tianjin Naval Hospital case, the French Consul in Tianjin actually hired workers a few days ago to pile the mud dug out of the Hai River into the hospital, in preparation for opening roads. He also arbitrarily surveyed two routes, nailing wooden stakes along the routes, diagonally crossing all the buildings of the hospital, dividing the hospital into branches, and starting construction to demolish it immediately.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Northwest Urgently Requires Attention</h3>
<p>The conflict between Hui and Han peoples in Xinjiang has spread from the local area of Hami County to counties across the east, west, and south of the province. The Xinjiang provincial government has even relocated to avoid the conflict. The seriousness of the situation is acknowledged nationally. According to official sources, the cause of the incident stems from the Xinjiang provincial government's recruitment of White Russian soldiers, whose lax military discipline provoked resentment among the Hui people. Furthermore, the house arrest of the eight Hui princes led to national disunity. While these two factors may be somewhat abstract, we can recall Zhang Zongchang's recruitment of Russian soldiers; while his army was brave and skilled in battle, its poor discipline led to widespread resentment among the general population. Moreover, the Hui people have a particularly strong fighting spirit; how could they long endure violent oppression without resistance? Furthermore, the corruption of officials has not decreased compared to the Yang Zengxin era. How can one expect political stability in Xinjiang and reconciliation between the Hui people and the government?</p>
<p>Xinjiang covers an area of 5.36 million square kilometers, with a total population of only 3 million. From afar, it is almost seen as a desolate area, due to the vast Gobi Desert stretching across it and impeding transportation. In recent years, bandits and soldiers have roamed freely, making it a dangerous place. However, Xinjiang is rich in resources. In addition to precious minerals such as jade and gold, coal and iron ore are also abundant. Both the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains are rich in mineral deposits, and the richness of its coal and oil deposits is unparalleled within China. As for agricultural products, the areas along the Tarim River are all arable land. The reason for their lack of development is the sparse population and the fact that the general population is not accustomed to farming. As a result, goods are left on the ground, and people are content with a simple life, reminiscent of the primitive era. However, the province borders two major powers, Britain and Russia. If transportation were convenient, how could it not become a continuation of the three northeastern provinces? Taking the city of Kashgar as an example, one can see the active attention of foreigners, who are constantly watching from the sidelines, calculating how to make a move.</p>
<p>Recently, the three northeastern provinces have fallen, and Jehol, adjacent to the northeast, has also been seized by a powerful enemy, despite its inconvenient transportation. More recently, the strategic passes along the Great Wall have fallen into enemy hands, and the people of the five counties of Luandong are groaning under the iron heel. The impact on North China is significant, and the financial and economic impact on China as a whole is even greater. China's foreign trade, from the inland provinces to Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, is characterized by imports exceeding exports. In other words, China is in a disadvantageous position in terms of trade balance. The three northeastern provinces are an exception, with exports exceeding imports for many years. Although Japanese financial and industrial investment there has exceeded 1.5 billion yen, the northeast remains rich and maintains its special advantageous position. Now that it has fallen, the prospect of its recovery is distant and uncertain. Before it is recovered, China's economic losses will be even greater than the loss of political power. The provinces of North China, such as Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, are all impoverished and await relief. It is difficult to use them as the vanguard for the recovery of the northeast, and it is not easy to supply them with provisions. Driving hungry people to war is something that has always been avoided. Moreover, in modern times, with the gradual awakening of popular wisdom, the people of the Republic are different from those of the autocratic era. Therefore, urgent, profound, and meticulous attention must be paid to the livelihood of the general population. Even if it is not possible to bear the burden of their lives individually, ways should be found to open up avenues for their livelihood, allowing them to flourish naturally. Only then will the country be able to become rich and its national strength gradually increase.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of China today and for the sake of recovering lost territory, special attention should be paid to the northwest, with Xinjiang as the base and the Hetao area as the granary, so that there will be resources for food and supplies, and good land will be developed. The development of Wuyuan is a smooth process without great difficulties. It is only necessary to carefully select local officials and encourage them to be good officials, so that the general society gradually becomes orderly. Then the operation of collective farms can achieve the greatest results in the near future.</p>
<p>Before Xinjiang can be developed, there is still a prerequisite issue: the past malpractices must be reformed, and the divisions between ethnic groups must be removed. Otherwise, there can be no peace, and how can progress be achieved? China has always had no absolute prejudice against religion, and there are no problems between individuals. Therefore, there is no major conflict between Islam and the Han people in various parts of Xinjiang. As for the conflicts between ethnic groups, they mostly belong to disputes arising from politics. Such disputes can be easily resolved if politics are enlightened. Therefore, the development of the northwest cannot be delayed any longer, and new political measures are particularly urgent. When politics are on track, economic construction can begin. The vast fertile fields can not only accommodate tens of millions of immigrants, but also exploit its mineral resources and produce its agricultural products, which can be used as resources for recovering the lost territory in the northeast, and can also alleviate the poverty of the rural areas on the verge of bankruptcy in the interior and relieve the suffocating cities.</p>
<p>Discussion of Economic Difficulties</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Talks Successful</h3>
<p>Public Announcement Declares Five Points of Understanding Reached</p>
<p>Trade Restrictions Left for Conference Resolution</p>
<p>Roosevelt Meets Separately with Herriot</p>
<p>World Economic Conference Opens in Mid-June</p>
<p>(Washington) The Anglo-American talks in Washington are practically completed. The US President and the British Prime Minister jointly issued a statement today expressing deep satisfaction with the results of the discussion of difficult problems for the upcoming World Economic Conference. They also declared that the following points have been considered: (1) World commodity prices; (2) Central bank policies; (3) Currency standards; (4) Exchange rate restrictions; (5) Improvement of the silver standard. In addition, many difficult problems regarding world trade were explored, with emphasis on restrictive measures. However, the issue of restrictions will be left to the final decision of the World Economic Conference. The conference is expected to open in mid-June. (National Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister MacDonald jointly issued a public statement declaring that any agreements they have reached on economic or other matters will be temporarily withheld and disclosed at the World Economic Conference. They stated that they are deeply satisfied with the progress made. The issues discussed included the world commodity price level, central bank policies, currency standards, improving the position of silver, and various other issues related to world trade. (National Telegram from the 24th)</p>
<h3>Franco-American Talks Begin</h3>
<p>(Washington) In the evening, President Roosevelt received the French representative, former Prime Minister Herriot, at the White House. He led experts from both countries in talks lasting approximately three hours. Roosevelt presented the technical plan that the United States intends to propose at the World Economic Conference to Herriot. They then discussed the disarmament issue, and Herriot explained the reasons why France could not accept the MacDonald plan. Subsequently, the experts from both countries withdrew, and Roosevelt, Herriot, and French Ambassador de Laboulaye continued to discuss until 11:30 PM. Herriot left the White House and returned to the Mayflower Hotel at 11:40 PM and issued a statement saying that President Roosevelt clearly did not want the World Economic Conference to open in a chaotic situation, but wanted to create a complete plan. First, he wanted to negotiate a solution with France on a few clear points, and then obtain agreement from other countries. Experts from France and the United States are scheduled to meet again at the State Department tomorrow morning at 10:30 AM, chaired by Secretary of State Hull. French experts will begin studying the American technical plan tomorrow. The date for the second meeting between Herriot and Roosevelt has been set for Wednesday. (Havas Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although Undersecretary of State Phillips stated that the issue of war debts was not mentioned before the experts during the talks between French representative Herriot and President Roosevelt, the two may have discussed the matter. Herriot told the press that President Roosevelt's technical plan for the World Economic Conference has been handed over to economic experts for study to create a draft plan.

<h3>Preparatory Committee for Economic Conference to Meet on Saturday</h3>
<p>(London) The preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference will meet at the British Foreign Office on Saturday afternoon. Representatives from eight countries, including Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Belgium, Norway, and the United States, will attend. The US representative is Davis, the chief representative to the Disarmament Conference. This meeting will determine the opening date of the World Economic Conference.

<h3>British and American Experts Continue to Discuss Equalizing Currency Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) British and American experts continued to discuss the key points of equalizing currency prices today. There are rumors that the two sides have different opinions on this issue, but the authorities deny it. It is reported that the discussion has not yet reached the stage of determining the ratio, but is focused on how to equalize currency prices and determine the best method. According to the authorities, the goal is not only to equalize currency prices, but also to focus on raising the general level of world commodity prices. (Reuters Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<h3>Suspension of Cash Redemption in Canada Is Tantamount to Abandoning the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>The cabinet order to suspend the redemption of Canadian gold banknotes in Ottawa was passed today, but the implementation date has not yet been determined. Officials claim that this plan only adjusts the situation that has arisen since Britain abandoned the gold standard. (Reuters Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(New York) Wall Street bankers believe that Canada's suspension of cash redemption of gold banknotes is tantamount to a formal acknowledgment that Canada has abandoned the gold standard. It is expected that Canada's move will cause foreigners, especially American businesses, to withdraw their existing funds from Canada. If so, Canada's restrictions on gold exports will be tightened. Bankers here believe that Canada has already theoretically abolished the gold standard since Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931. (Reuters Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) There was great panic here tonight when the Canadian Minister of Finance announced that the Canadian government had suspended the redemption of Dominion banknotes with gold. However, because the news arrived late in the US, it did not affect the gold dollar exchange rate today. The initial interpretation here is that it is a divorce movement between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar, as the two countries' dollars have had a close relationship for hundreds of years. Sometimes the Canadian dollar has suffered as a result. There may be a movement to make the Canadian dollar more closely tied to the gold pound. However, some financial experts believe that the Canadian government's move is necessary to stabilize international exchange rates. (National Telegram from the 24th)</p>
<h3>The Momentum of the Inflation Movement in Congress Suddenly Declines</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the momentum of the inflation movement in the US Congress suddenly declined. The silver faction has decided to delay all monetary reform bills pending further appeal by the President. The reason for this is not yet clear. It is reported that the Democratic leaders in both houses believe that the President and British Prime Minister MacDonald will be able to negotiate a satisfactory understanding, and that a similar understanding will be reached with former French Prime Minister Herriot. However, the White House and the experts who have met with Secretary of State Hull have not indicated that silver will be discussed separately. The silver faction in the Senate is unwilling to speculate on the outcome of the President's talks with foreign envoys. Other senators have suggested that the silver faction may have been misled, believing that the President is actually an advocate of sound money and that his request for the power to mint silver coins and inflate the gold dollar is only intended to prevent Congress from acting rashly. With the President in control, he can restrict inflation as he sees fit. One senator said that the President is clearly pretending to be in favor of inflating the currency in order to avoid a fierce debate in Congress when he and the heads of other countries work together to stabilize the currency. However, there is also an indication that the United States was forced to abandon the gold standard, revealing a situation that has caused members of Congress to postpone their original plans. This morning, British Prime Minister MacDonald and his daughter attended a breakfast at the home of Senator Borah, the leader of the silver faction and former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and then continued talks with the US President. Financial experts and economists are also still meeting as before. (National Telegram from the 24th)</p>
<h3>Republicans Oppose the Currency Inflation Bill</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate convened to discuss the currency inflation bill. Senator Thomas began his speech, saying that no bill submitted by parliaments around the world is as important as this one. There are 20 million US dollars in the hands of certain classes, and these classes did not obtain it through legitimate work. On the contrary, there is a class in debt that has the right to obtain this huge sum. The effect of the proposed bill is to transfer this huge sum from the former to the latter. The wording of this bill can make bank depositors and holders of interest-bearing securities transfer this money to the public. Republican Senator Little asked, "Is what you are saying the content of the currency inflation amendment?" Thomas replied, "(If it is not handled in this way, the indebted class cannot fully obtain justice)." When the discussion began, Senator Fletcher, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, declared that he had originally opposed the devaluation of the US dollar clause, but is now prepared to support it. Senator Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland, echoed the Republican opposition to the currency inflation bill, saying that if this bill is passed, the United States will lose foreign markets, and at least 4.8 million people will lose their jobs. Although Republicans and some Democratic members of Congress strongly opposed it, the Senate seems likely to pass the bill within the next day or two. (Havas Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<h3>British Financial Circles Believe Currency Price Stabilization Is Impossible</h3>
<p>(London) London financial circles believe today that the early stabilization of the British pound and the US dollar is impossible, as the appropriate parity depends on various factors, which are still unknown. However, Anglo-American talks do seem to have resolved many differences in principle. The fact that yesterday's joint communiqué from the US President and the British Prime Minister did not mention war debts is seen as noteworthy, but it is expected that the US President will continue to make statements on this matter within a week.

<p>The Japanese Also Recognize Humanity and International Justice</p>
<p>Loudly Appeal to the British Indian Government</p>
<p>The newly formed Indian Affairs Economic Federation in Osaka passed the following resolution today: "The act of abolishing the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty disregards the friendship that has existed between Britain and Japan for many years, destroys the economic relations between India and Japan, and endangers millions of Japanese people who are engaged in the export trade to India. It only benefits a small number of industrialists in England and India, and what they gain is at the expense of 35 million Indians. In terms of humanity and international justice, this is intolerable. Therefore, all related associations oppose the abolition of the treaty and will consider effective countermeasures." The federation has representatives from 50 of the most important commercial associations in western Japan, including chambers of commerce and industry associations in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto.

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain, Explains the Budget to Parliament</h3>
<p>War Debt to the United States Not Included, Striving for Balance of Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>Hoping the Washington Conference Will Promote the Restoration of Credit</p>
<p>(London) Reuters, 25th. At 3:20 PM today, the House of Commons convened. Every seat in the chamber and the visitors' gallery was filled. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain rose to present the budget. Cheers erupted from the cabinet members' seats. After the cheers subsided, everyone listened attentively to Chamberlain's speech. He stated that the previous year's final accounts showed a shortfall of £32,679,000. As of March 31st, the national debt totaled £7,645,000,000, of which £897,534,000 was owed to the United States. War debts owed by various autonomous regions and colonies totaled £114,234,000. Debts owed to England by the Allied countries totaled £1,115,738,000, of which £755,875,000 was in French currency. The unreturned debts of Russia totaled £1,100,000,000. The shortfall in the budget included approximately £29,000,000 for repayment to the United States and a debt repayment fund of £17,000,000. Last year, total debt repayment required a net amount of approximately £15,000,000. Excluding the US debt, the net surplus exceeded £11,000,000, the result of which was even more satisfying than the surplus obtained in normal prosperous years. Last year's beer tax revenue totaled £74,000,000, the lowest figure in thirteen years. Customs duties and excise taxes decreased by £12,000,000. The exchange of bonds can obtain permanent benefits, but it cannot succeed unless we firmly adhere to a balanced budget. Last year's shortfall was due to the £29,000,000 repayment of the US debt. This year's budget did not include the repayment of the US debt or the payment of debts owed to England. Last year was a year of very good financial performance. England's achievements have aroused general praise. Income tax and surcharges decreased by £19,000,000 due to the substantial decrease in personal income. This year, England should repay the United States £51,000,000, while the compensation and debt returned by the Allied countries totaled £64,500,000. Chamberlain predicted that the revenue from beer and other beverage license taxes would decrease again. Chamberlain believed that the disputes between England and Ireland showed no signs of ending in the near future. Based on existing tax revenues, Chamberlain estimated revenue at £712,000,000. He also stated that the exchange rate equalization fund had been tested in turbulent times and was sufficient to maintain the exchange rate in a relatively stable position. The rumor that England used this fund to lower the price of the pound was not true. However, the amount was still insufficient, so he planned to ask the House of Commons to increase it. Chamberlain went on to mention the Washington talks, saying that he understood Roosevelt's move to suspend the gold standard was not made for negotiations with other countries, but was purely prompted by domestic circumstances. However, the current situation is indeed worrying. He hoped that the other plans proposed by the US President would definitely promote the restoration of trust. The English people's purchasing and saving power can still be maintained, not greatly reduced due to the sluggishness of international trade and the large number of unemployed. Chamberlain then announced that starting from January 1st next year, heavy vehicle taxes would be increased, and heavy oil would be taxed one penny per gallon.</p>

<p>(Havas) Paris, 24th. Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour spoke at a rally in the Saint-Dié constituency, showing little concern for the recent panic in public opinion. He said that France had never let go of any opportunity to build peace. He would protect the security of his country carefully. If France did not obtain equal security internationally, the security of France itself would never be relinquished. Paul-Boncour also said that the various principles advocated in the French disarmament proposal had been approved by the majority of countries at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, and a portion of them had been adopted by the British proposal. Paul-Boncour further explained France's views on the Four-Power Pact plan, saying that its outline was nothing more than (1) seeking opportunities to prevent European countries from being divided into two opposing factions, maintaining and consolidating peace, and not allowing anyone to undermine it; (2) bringing France and Italy closer together, without loosening the relationship between the two countries created by the memorial of the European war and common interests. The justice of France's views can be seen from the recent debate in the British House of Commons. Paul-Boncour concluded by saying that although this task felt difficult, it was not impossible to accomplish.</p>

<h3>Political Situation on the Eve of a Gathering Storm</h3>
<p>Political Association Advocates for the Formation of a Cabinet of Talents</p>
<p>Opposes Saito's Disruption of Constitutional Norms</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th – Premier Saito has declared his determination to reorganize the cabinet, and the Seiyukai (政友會) has decided to end internal discord and proceed towards opposing the Saito cabinet. The Seiyukai believes that after the May 15th Incident (五一五事件) reached a certain conclusion and the extraordinary situation was resolved, the Saito cabinet should have relinquished power and returned to the normal path of constitutional government. Regarding the extraordinary international situation after the Manchurian Incident (滿洲事變), which cannot be resolved in a few years, the Seiyukai believes that a Seiyukai cabinet with an absolute majority of 300 members in the parliament should take charge of this kind of extraordinary situation. Based on this view, even if Finance Minister Takahashi resigns, the government's negotiations with the Seiyukai to supplement a successor will be decisively rejected. When the Finance Minister's resignation is realized, the Minister of Railways, Minister of Education Hatoyama, and other party cabinet members will inevitably advance and retreat together with the Finance Minister. The Seiyukai recognizes the extraordinary situation and advocates for the emergence of a cabinet of talents. If the current government opposes this return to constitutional norms and dissolves the parliament, the Seiyukai will not hesitate. All responsibilities for the resulting political turmoil should be borne by the government. It has been internally decided to adopt this stance and take a tough attitude towards the government.</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 25th – The Seiyukai has heard that Premier Saito is unwilling to relinquish power in the shortest period. Internal unrest within the party is gradually increasing. Seiyukai President Suzuki dispatched Secretary-General Yamaguchi today to visit the Minister of Railways, Tsuchiya, to inquire about the Finance Minister's true intentions and the actual situation of the political situation, and to ask Tsuchiya about his views on the cabinet reorganization, in order to determine a strategy of war or peace. After Yamaguchi met with Tsuchiya, he reported everything to Suzuki.</p>

<h3>Japanese Believe in Immortality, Researching Qin Shi Huang's Elixir of Life</h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 21st, Qin Shi Huang sent Xu Fu to the eastern Penglai Islands (Japan) to seek the elixir of immortality. At that time, Xu Fu brought 500 young boys and girls, sailed across the ocean to Japan, and brought hundreds of ancient documents. After painstaking research, he invented the elixir of immortality. This medicine is now being researched by Mr. Moriichi Tsuchida of the Brewing Department of the Faculty of Engineering at Osaka University. Its ingredients are known to be a precise blend of (1) ginseng, (2) cloves, (3) fennel, (4) chilam, (5) Angelica japonica, (6) rhubarb, and (7) Ligusticum chuanxiong, with fermented substances, to become a kind of spiritual wine. Tsuchida has collected the materials for each medicine and is trying to brew it in the brewing experiment laboratory of the Faculty of Engineering using special equipment. As a result, he has created a strange and fragrant medicinal wine, which has attracted attention from all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Lenin's Corpse Decaying</h3>

<h3>Inspection Record of the Saho Bridge Area (Special Correspondent Geng Ya of this Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Santunying: Since the war in the East has gradually been losing ground, and the enemy forces have been increasing the number of Mongolian and Korean fresh troops, intensifying their offensive against the Xifengkou front, there have been fierce battles with gains and losses in the positions around the north and south of Saho Bridge (撒河橋) and Tuanting (團汀). After the reporter obtained the permission of Commander Zhang of the 38th Division of the 29th Army, a staff officer of the division was specially dispatched to guide me to inspect the front line. Fearing air raids, we set off from Zunhua at night. This section of transportation was also mostly carried out at night. The car passed through the East Gate, which was already closed, but after explaining the situation, we were allowed to pass. There were patrol sentries near the villages we encountered along the way, in groups of three or five, carrying guns and remaining vigilant. The car was also carrying more than a dozen boxes of guns and ammunition, and six machine guns. The road was rugged and bumpy, and we were deeply concerned that the ammunition would explode due to friction. Later, we gradually unloaded the guns and ammunition at a certain brigade headquarters and a certain regiment headquarters, and my heart was at ease. It was already midnight, and everything was silent except for the rattling of the car and the buzzing sound of the wind blowing through the power lines. The car's headlights suddenly revealed a red swastika flag waving as a marker. There were seven or eight large cars, each carrying the coffins of fallen soldiers, left on the side of the road to give way. Upon arriving at the office of the Red Swastika Society west of Santunying City, I saw a heavy truck with corpses underneath and wounded soldiers sitting on top. The scene was desolate and tragic beyond description, but one can imagine the intensity of the fighting on the front lines and the lack of transportation vehicles. The next morning, I met with Li Wentian, the Chief of Staff of the 38th Division, and heard about the course of the battle and the determination he held. He said, in brief: "Since the September 18th Incident (九一八事變) broke out and the three northeastern provinces were lost, this spring Japan only used three divisions and one mixed brigade to re-occupy our Rehe in less than six days. The nation is ashamed, and the soldiers are even more ashamed. Our army has been unable to reorganize since the 19th year of the Republic, and there are many deficiencies, but in terms of education, we have always taught the soldiers about righteousness. From now on, we will focus on external threats and not internal conflicts. The small results we have achieved are based on this. In the age of iron, the Great Wall, where one man could hold the pass and ten thousand could not pass, has lost its effectiveness. It is said that the attacker always wins and the defender always loses. Our army took over the defense hastily, the fortifications were not prepared, and the weapons are far inferior to those of the enemy. In every battle, we fight the enemy's sharp weapons with our flesh and blood. The magnitude of the sacrifice is hard to describe in a single word. But I hope that the government will make a major decision as soon as possible, and the people will strive to provide support. The country's future may not be hopeless." Just then, we heard the sound of a bell, which was used by the watchmen on our city to warn that enemy planes had arrived. We took shelter in a cave and saw six enemy planes, in two rows, flying over Zunhua, Jixian, Yutian, Luowenyu and other places for reconnaissance. Fortunately, they did not drop bombs, but the faces of the old people in the crowded cave had turned pale. Later, I took a car to the Saho Bridge position to see our army strictly guarding the west bank of the Luo River and the Yanjianshan and other highlands, which are within the effective firing range of the enemy's artillery. The houses and people were bombed by enemy planes and artillery shells even more fiercely than in Santunying. The bombs dropped by enemy planes were mostly marked with the words "special weight" (特重), as long as a person, weighing over 120 pounds, and capable of penetrating the ground to a depth of seven or eight feet, digging a hole as deep as a giant pool. People who had taken shelter in nearby caves were buried by the flying dirt, or crushed by the earth, resulting in countless deaths. Luowenyu and other places were also subjected to the horrific disaster of enemy aircraft bombing with (killing effect) and explosion bombs (destructive effect). In the areas not yet captured, the Japanese used absurd leaflets to confuse our ignorant people, and in the areas already trampled by the enemy's iron hooves, they even fantasized and pasted various paintings all over the walls. The reporter uncovered four of them: one depicts five people with their arms intertwined, one in the middle with a long braid, and the other two each holding the puppet state flag of Manchuria, stepping on the puppet state territory of "Great Manchuria" composed of (Jilin Province) (Fengtian Province) Heilongjiang Province (Rehe Province) (Xingan Province), with a large sun half-exposed behind them. The second picture is a picture of peaceful scenery, still adorned with puppet flags, suns, and happy red and green men and women, with the inscription: "The Manchukuo is a paradise that we never dreamed of. The five grains are abundant, the livestock are fat, under the rule of the Wangdao, all people live in peace and work in joy, in the age of Yao and Shun, there is a great atmosphere of peace." The third picture depicts Japanese soldiers buying things from our merchants, with the inscription: "The Japanese soldiers are all good family children, serving as soldiers for the country and for peace. They are very strict with troublemakers, but they are very reasonable with merchants and civilians, so the Japanese army is welcomed everywhere." The fourth picture is half a picture of a fairy scattering flowers, with the inscription: "People who are happy to follow the Manchukuo will enjoy happiness like this in the afterlife," and half a picture of King Yama judging cases, with the image of two criminals kneeling on the ground tied up, reflecting the pattern of the Big Sword Society killing each other in the karmic mirror, and King Yama being furious, ordering the ghost king to inflict various cruel tortures in hell, with the inscription: "People who betray the Manchukuo will suffer like this in the afterlife." Their contempt for our nation, still treating us as ignorant and ignorant slaves in the age of divine authority, can be described as the ultimate in insult and absurdity. Seeing this, no one can help but be infuriated. However, some of our ignorant villagers have been confused. For example, Zhang Fushun, a resident of Sanying, was originally a scout in our army, but later went to work outside the customs and was bought by the Japanese, revealing all of our military intelligence. He was caught yesterday, and he confessed immediately. He was very thirsty and asked two orderlies for water, but the soldiers, only thirteen or fourteen years old, shouted loudly, "Traitor, slave of a subjugated country, you still want to drink water?" He replied, "Who wants to be a slave of a subjugated country? I was really deceived by the Japanese." Hearing this, I felt pity for him. When the Manchu children living in the Shimenzhen Eastern Tombs were asked, "Are you afraid when the Japanese soldiers come here?", they always answered calmly, "No, we are Manchus." From this, it can be seen that the people in the war zone urgently need propaganda, so that they know the great righteousness of patriotism. Even if we embrace Buddhism at the last minute, it should not be delayed. The Japanese army not only has new and sharp weapons, but also clothing that adapts to the environment and is added at any time. Our Big Sword Society has repeatedly achieved success in close combat, so the enemy's vanguards are equipped with steel collars, vests, and helmets to protect themselves. Recently, in the battle on the river, they had rubber clothing that could be used for wading. However, because the clothing was too elaborate, their actions were clumsy. In a mountain in the Kou Nei, an enemy cavalryman was taking pictures from a high place, but was unexpectedly chased by our army. They were frightened and did not have time to ride their horses, and were burdened by their heavy clothing and leather boots, which made it difficult to run, so they were captured by our sentries. The soldiers were awarded 200 yuan for capturing the prisoners alive, but the soldiers all said that capturing prisoners alive was great, but it was troublesome to escort and guard them, and if they escaped, the enemy would have one more person's firepower, so the soldiers considered this a big burden. The residents of Santunying were originally very poor, and with the continuous bombing of the Japanese aircraft, the scene was even more desolate. However, in the wilderness of smoke and grass, the stele of Qi Jiguang's words and the tombstone of Xueyan still stand tall, providing a place for future generations to mourn. The Jingzhongshan Beijige Temple, where the emperors of the former Qing Dynasty had to make a detour to participate in the spring and autumn hunts, has solemn Buddhist statues, mostly made of gold, and the cages, tables, furnaces, and bottles are of unknown origin, mixed with petrified bamboo of various shapes and colors, carved and decorated, which is very beautiful. If our army does not do its best to resist the violent Japanese, I am afraid that the treasures of the Rehe Xinggong Palace will also become exhibits in the Tokyo Museum. 4/18</p>
<h3>Japanese Conspiracy to Invade and Disturb Pingjin Reaches</h3>
<p>Military and Political Advances Together</p>
<p>Recent Battle Situation Moves to Gubeikou</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Peiping: After the Japanese army occupied the east of the Luo River and the various passes of the Great Wall, although they claimed to have no intention of invading Pingjin, in fact, they take an inch and try to get a mile, and their intentions are huge. Moreover, their conspiracy to invade and disturb Pingjin is divided into two steps, political and military, which is very active. In the political aspect, they use traitors as accomplices and create a special organization in North China. Before Duan Qirui left Tianjin, the Japanese originally intended to use this old man as a puppet. Zeng Yu-jun, Yao Zhen, and others of the Duan family were also eager to try and had close relations with the Japanese. After Duan left Tianjin, the Japanese plan failed, so they changed their method, first resorting to force and then talking about politics. The occupation of Rehe and the east of the Luo River in the past two months is clear evidence of this. Recently, with the military progress, they have also advanced politically. Through traitors such as Li Jichun, they have lured the old warlords in Pingjin and colluded with general frustrated politicians, local tyrants, and evil gentry to carry out activities. As a result, some people who are greedy for wealth and lack firm principles are caught in their trap, and rumors abound, such as the "North China State" movement and the "Protecting the Territory and Protecting the People" movement, which spring up in various forms. Once the brewing is mature, it will erupt. It is said that the authorities are paying close attention and are taking measures to prevent it. In the military aspect, since our army has completely withdrawn to the west of the Luo River, the Japanese army on that side has no active action for the time being, so they have transferred heavy troops to Xifengkou and Gubeikou to conspire to go south along the Pinggu, Sanhe, and Xianghe areas, directly approaching Langfang, cutting off the connection between Pingjin. At the same time, they take a surrounding posture towards Pingjin, causing our Pingjin garrison to withdraw automatically, avoiding fighting near Pingjin, in an attempt to reduce international accusations. For this reason, in recent days, the Japanese army has been using artillery, aircraft, infantry, and cavalry in the Gubeikou area to launch fierce attacks on the left and right wings. Our army has fought bravely. From the 20th to the 23rd, we have been fighting bloodily for three days and nights. The number of deaths and injuries on both sides is over two to three thousand. The battle of Longtangou was particularly fierce, with more than eleven close combats. The positions were contested back and forth five or six times. Our army fell one after another, and their spirit was truly rare. In this battle, two battalion commanders of our Huang Division were killed, one was injured, and the casualties of officers and soldiers reached more than 2,000. The Japanese army's casualties were also comparable. Yesterday (22nd), the battle was fierce all day, and the enemy did not succeed. Our army's front still held the Nantiantianmen position, and the left and right wings were confronting the enemy in the Badaolouzi and Pochengzi areas. Last night, because the enemy had repeatedly failed to attack, they detoured to attack our left wing with a large force. Fortunately, our army detected it and took advantage of the emptiness of the enemy's rear, and urgently dispatched a certain unit at 3:00 a.m. that night, bypassing the enemy's rear from the right wing, and attacked the enemy's brigade headquarters in the Dongguan inside the Gubeikou, killing 500 to 600 enemy soldiers on the spot, capturing more than 30 prisoners, and seizing a lot of military supplies. At about 5:00 a.m. this morning, the enemy learned that their rear had been attacked, and urgently mobilized a large force from the west to return to aid. After our army successfully attacked, they gradually retreated to their original position and held it firmly. The enemy launched a large-scale attack again this afternoon, and fierce fighting is still underway. Our army has stationed more than two divisions in the Gubeikou area, and the military strength is still strong. In the Xifengkou area, the enemy has also been increasing reinforcements in recent days, waiting for an opportunity to attack. There have been artillery battles in the Saho Bridge area yesterday and today. Song Zheyuan has already arrived at the front to command the resistance. (April 23)</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Sichuan Armies Liu and Deng</h3>
<p>Opening Fire in Jianyang Due to Competition for Power and Profit</p>
<p>Tian Yang and Others Tend to Be Involved in the Vortex</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Communication: Since the ceasefire between the two Lius (劉) in Sichuan Province, the warlords have only known how to expand their own strength and territory, and wantonly exploit the people. A few days ago, Li Jiayu of the 6th New Division and the troops of Tian Songyao of the 29th Army had a conflict in Guihuayuan, Suining, due to a dispute over local tax revenue agencies. Fortunately, the situation did not escalate. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram and Yang Sen of the 20th Army mediated with armed forces, a storm was quelled. However, one wave was not settled, and another rose. A few days ago, Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, who had been defeated in battle, felt that the loss of defense was very large, and his income was greatly reduced. The military expenditure was very strained, so he thought of another way out. Because Deng Xihou of the 28th Army had acted in favor of Liu Xiang during the war between the two Lius, causing Liu Wenhui's army to suffer significant losses, Liu proposed conditions to Liu Xihou in order to obtain compensation: (1) Please Deng's army cede the Chengdu Municipal Government to be jointly formed by the armies of Liu and Deng. All monthly income of more than 100,000 yuan will also be divided equally. The mayor will have a head and a deputy, appointed jointly by the armies of Liu and Deng. (2) Chen Shunong, the commander of the 3rd Division of Deng's army, is currently stationed in Hechuan, Tongliang, Wusheng, Bishan, and Dazu counties. He was originally under Liu Wenhui's command, but he defected to Deng's army during the war between the two Lius. Now, the title of commander of the 3rd Division must be revoked and the flag changed. (3) Chen Shunong must return Lezhi, Jianyang, and other counties to Liu's army, otherwise they will meet with soldiers. Deng Xihou refused to recognize all three of the above conditions, which led to a rift with Liu. Liu immediately mobilized the troops of the three divisions, concentrated in Chengdu, and demonstrated to Deng's army. Deng's army also did not yield to each other. Both sides went to extremes, and the guards were strict. In the Lezhi and Jianyang areas, Liu's army had expelled Chen's troops from Deng's army. Yesterday (20th), the two armies formally opened fire in Longquanyi Xiangquanpu and other places, and there is a trend of expansion. Tian Songyao of the 29th Army, Yang Sen of the 20th Army, Luo Zezhou of the 23rd Division, and Li Jiayu and others are also in a state of being involved in the vortex. Currently, the people of Sichuan are actively mediating and calling for peace, but it is difficult to predict whether it will be effective. (April 23)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Water Patrol Team Seizes Stolen Goods Ship</p>
<p>The county water patrol team discovered two suspicious ships in the Xiuye Bridge River today, one from Jiangbei and one from Luhu. Patrol Officer Fei of the team boarded the ships for investigation and found several packages of clothes, many pawn tickets, and gold and silver ornaments, which were obviously of unknown origin. There were two women with Jiangbei accents and a child on board the Jiangbei ship. There was a man on the Luhu ship. After questioning, the woman confessed that the man had taken a car to Shanghai this morning and would return to Songjiang on a late bus, presumably to sell the stolen goods in Shanghai. They were immediately taken back to the team headquarters. When the late bus arrived in Songjiang, they were escorted to the station together with the women to wait for the arrest.</p>
<h3>Prisoners of the High Court Sent to Songjiang</h3>
<p>(Suzhou) The original detention center of the High Court has now been changed to a detention center, with many prisoners inside, and the houses still need to be repaired. Therefore, prisoners are sent to county prisons with fewer prisoners. Yesterday, Suzhou sent 50 prisoners, who were escorted to Songjiang on a late bus and immediately imprisoned in the county prison.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Merchants and People Petition for the Reopening of Pawnshops After the treasurer of Bao Cheng Pawnshop in Dongmen Street absconded with money, the business was suspended and the interior was reorganized. However, the local business was greatly affected, and the poor were even more inconvenienced. The various shops repeatedly petitioned the county government to order the pawnshop to resume business within a time limit. After the county government issued several orders, the pawnshop suddenly moved to the back door of Bao Yuan Pawnshop on Dajie on the 21st to operate. The merchants and people of Dongmen Street were dissatisfied with this move, so on the morning of the 24th, they gathered hundreds of people, holding flags, and went to the county government to petition, demanding that the Bao Cheng Pawnshop be moved back to its original place to operate as soon as possible, and would not stop until the goal was achieved. County Magistrate Cheng received them and promised to order the pawnshop to move back to operate. The crowd was satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Uneven Warmth and Cold, Epidemic Prevails</p>
<p>Due to continuous spring rain, alternating cold and heat, there have been discoveries of epidemic cholera. On the 23rd, Chen Chiping, a physical education teacher at Nanjin, and a certain school servant, discovered abdominal pain, numbness in their hands and feet, vomiting, and diarrhea, and were rushed to the Lunyuan Hospital for treatment and injected with physiological saline to escape danger. In addition, meningitis has also been spreading rapidly in recent days, with children being the main sufferers. If treatment is delayed, there is a risk of death.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>County Prison Thief Escapes Yu Sanbao, a native of Jiangyin, is 29 years old. In the 19th year of the Republic, he was arrested and sent to the county for gang robbery of silkworm cocoons, and was sentenced to ten years in prison and sent to the county prison to serve his sentence. However, Yu showed a docile attitude after entering prison and was able to work as a mason, so he was often ordered to repair the damaged walls in the prison. Recently, with continuous spring rain, the tiles of the fifth prison room of the county prison were damaged, so prison warden Han Yuwen ordered Yu to repair the roof, and ordered Zhang Yonghuai and Jia Zhengxin, the guards on duty, to keep a close watch. Later, because Yu's feet were chained with heavy shackles, it was inconvenient to go on the roof, so the two guards removed the iron shackles from his left foot. Yu saw that the back of the prison room was the large parade ground of the water police district, and that there was no one in the parade ground. In an instant, he came up with an idea, jumped from the roof, and escaped without a trace. When the two guards discovered it, he was already gone like a crane that has flown away. They immediately reported to prison warden Han, who immediately sent the police team stationed in the county prison to search everywhere, and telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to send police to assist in the arrest. However, Yu had already fled far away and could not be caught. Afterwards, prison warden Han sent the two guards on duty to the county for interrogation and detention, and requested punishment, and submitted Yu's age, height, appearance, and other information to the county government, which was forwarded to the High Court, ordering all subordinates to assist in the arrest.</p>
<h3>Peanut Oil Factory Strike</h3>
<p>There were as many as 50 peanut oil refining factories in this county at its peak. In recent years, due to the impact of the dumping of Russian oil in China, the business of each factory has declined sharply. About two-thirds of the factories have closed down one after another. In addition, the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to Xishe to collect special business tax on peanut oil. According to the tax collection method, the factory is required to pay a corner of stamp tax for each lift of oil produced every day, and each factory is required to recognize 10 yuan per day. If the factory stops refining, it must report to the collection office in advance, and the collection office will send personnel to seal the furnace and stop collecting taxes. If the refined peanut oil is transported to other ports for sale, the collection office must send personnel to inspect and affix stamps. The factories therefore believe that the loss is very large and cannot bear the burden. Therefore, they went on strike together yesterday, stopped refining, and discussed countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Construction Department Bans Native Silkworm Seed The Construction Department has received a telegram from Xia Zhong, the instructor of the Zhenju Lijiang Yi five-county sericulture improvement area, stating that the Zhenju Lijiang Yi five-county sericulture improvement area has now started smoothly. However, after investigation, the local silkworm seeds in each county are still very prevalent. If strict measures are not taken to ban them, it will hinder the improvement work. It is proposed to ask the superior to send a telegram to each county in the improvement area, strictly prohibiting the breeding of local varieties, and those who violate the law will be punished in accordance with Article 21 of the Jiangsu Province Interim Measures for Banning Silkworm Seeds. Is it appropriate to do so? We respectfully request your appraisal and telegraphic instructions for compliance, etc. The Construction Department believes that native silkworm seeds are of poor quality, difficult to breed, and have a significant impact on improving sericulture and increasing the livelihood of farmers. They should be strictly prohibited. It has now instructed each county magistrate to comply immediately.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>

<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Three Drowned in Collapsed Pavilion</p>
<p>Residents of Shuanglin Town in Huzhou Prefecture were celebrating the Dongyue Festival at approximately 3 PM on the 22nd of this month when a "Tianqiao Pai" cigarette boat docked at the riverbank outside the Yao Xingchang rice shop and the Wang Jichang fruit shop in the town's North Gate. The boat had a radio playing opera to attract attention, causing men and women watching the festival to crowd into the waterside pavilion to listen. However, the pavilion, which had been in disrepair for years, collapsed under the excessive weight of the crowd, with the roof collapsing at the same time. People on the pavilion all fell into the water. Around sixty or seventy people fell into the water, and fortunately, bystanders managed to rescue them. More than ten people sustained minor injuries, and thirty to forty people sustained serious injuries. The wife of Wang Shunbao, a fruit shop owner, who was over sixty years old, and the wife and daughter of the Xie family boat owner all drowned. The local Public Security Bureau sent police to the scene, detained the cigarette boat and its crew, and the townspeople reported the drowning to the Wuxing branch of the court for inspection of the corpses.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Cotton Mill Industry Petition in the Capital</h3>
<p>Outcome Not Entirely Satisfactory. Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, Guo Shun, Zhang Zemin, representatives of Chinese cotton mills, and Wu Huanru, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 25th. According to them, Chinese cotton mills have suffered in recent years from the dumping of Japanese cotton yarn, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the decline in people's purchasing power, the heavy burden of unified production taxes, and the tightening of bank financing. In Shanghai alone, more than 3.6 million pieces of cotton yarn (each piece containing forty small bales) have accumulated and cannot be sold. In order to maintain the survival of cotton mills and the minimum living standards of workers, a uniform reduction in working hours has been implemented in cotton mills across the country. The Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Shanghai Municipal Government have sent personnel to investigate the real reasons for the reduction in working hours. After the representatives of each ministry returned to Beijing and reported, the matter was submitted to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan also recognized the seriousness of the matter, believing that if no remedial measures were taken, Chinese cotton mills across the country would be in danger of collapsing entirely, and hundreds of thousands of workers would become unemployed, creating a major panic in China's unemployment problem. Therefore, they summoned the representatives to Beijing to discuss ways to rescue the situation. There are now three requests to the government for relief: (1) The banking sector must provide low-interest loans to manufacturers. Because there are currently more than 3.6 million pieces of cotton yarn in Shanghai, the banking sector has long refused to accept cotton yarn as collateral. In addition to losing interest on the accumulated cotton yarn, there is no way to borrow cash to supplement working capital. This requires the Ministry of Finance and the banking sector to have appropriate measures. (2) A portion of the unified tax revenue must be allocated to rescue manufacturers. Because the unified production tax is levied on both domestic and foreign factory goods, but the tax standards are classified by yarn count. Foreign yarn factories produce more fine yarn, which is very beneficial to foreign merchants. A portion of the tax revenue should be used to rescue Chinese cotton mills. (3) The transportation of cotton and yarn must be expedited, and transportation costs must be reduced. For example, in Zhengzhou and other places, cotton purchased by various factories sometimes takes more than a month to be shipped. The same is true for the shipment of yarn and cloth, which causes significant losses to manufacturers. In the current situation of wind and rain, transportation costs should be reduced even more. A total of sixty-two companies have joined the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, accounting for 77% of the cotton mills in the country. In Shanghai alone, there are approximately 100,000 cotton mill workers. This reduction in working hours will reduce the number of workers by half, which is a significant social problem. Currently, Shanghai, Tongzhou, Wuxi, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and other places have uniformly implemented the reduction in working hours. Tianjin cabled back to the association yesterday that the current situation is not just a reduction in working hours; the only option is to announce a shutdown. Some cotton mills have already implemented a shutdown, and the remaining cotton mills will also shut down soon. Workers in Shanghai are well aware of the difficulties faced by manufacturers, so no accidents have occurred since the implementation of the reduction in working hours. The scheduled reduction in working hours is for one month. If the government has relief measures, the situation can be restored to its original state next month. The representatives went to the Executive Yuan to meet with Premier Wang, but he was in an administrative meeting and could not meet. In the afternoon, the representatives went to Wang's residence in Sajiawan to discuss the current state of decline in the national cotton industry, its causes, and requested the government to provide appropriate relief in terms of tax rates, transportation, and finance, in order to avoid shutdowns and prevent countless workers from becoming unemployed. Wang agreed to consult with the relevant ministers and make a decision. There was no satisfactory result. It is speculated that these relief measures cannot be decided in a short period of time. The representatives took a train back to Shanghai on the night of the 25th and are scheduled to come to Beijing again.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Loan Contract in the Chen-Li Case of Illegally Pledging the China Merchants Bureau's Four Warehouses</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Review Based on the Report of the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 25th: After the discovery of the case in which Chen Fumu, the former supervisor of the China Merchants Bureau, and Li Guojie, the former general manager of the Bureau, entered into a loan contract with the China Business Corporation and paid 700,000 taels, the Minister of Communications Zhu Jia Hua repeatedly ordered the board of directors of the Bureau to study methods to cancel the contract and earnestly negotiate with the Corporation to cancel it. The Corporation initially insisted on not agreeing, but Zhu insisted, and the board of directors negotiated earnestly again, and finally agreed to return the funds and terminate the contract, and all related documents were also completely invalidated. It is said that Zhu has submitted the result of the negotiation to cancel the contract to the Executive Yuan for review based on the report of the board of directors.</p>

<p>Members of the Japan Study Tour Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Philippine Industrial Delegation, consisting of more than thirty people, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and immediately checked into the Astor House Hotel on the Garden Bridge. At 9:15 AM yesterday, representatives of various agencies accompanied the delegation to visit the central city area and various factories. Business groups such as the Banking Association and the Shipping Association hosted a banquet for the delegation, which left for Beijing by train last night. The Japan Friendship Study Tour arrived in Shanghai at 8:20 AM yesterday morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Departure for Visit</h3>

At 9:15 AM, they accompanied all the members of the delegation, divided into twelve cars, to visit the central city area, Tongji University in Zhabei and Wusong. At 12 PM, they went to the Wing On Cotton Mill, where Guo Shun hosted a lunch. At 1 PM, they departed from the factory to visit Jiaotong University, Xujiahui Observatory, Longhua Scenic Spot, Longhua Cement Company, and Zhanghua Woolen Mill, and finished their visit at around 6 PM, returning to the Astor House Hotel for rest. The Banking Association, the Shipping Association, the Trading Association, and the International Trade Association held a banquet at the Banking Club at 8 PM that night.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Cement Factory</h3>
<p>Wu Qingtai, the factory director of China Cement Company, and Liu Hongsheng, the representative, greeted and welcomed the delegation. The visiting group was divided into five groups, with five engineers serving as hosts to visit the entire process from rock and mud to cement production and barrel packaging. Then, in the newly completed chemical laboratory of the factory, tea and snacks were served. Wu Qingtai delivered a welcome speech, and the leader of the delegation gave a reply. It was already dusk, so they hurriedly took the Zhanghua Woolen Mill's ferry to Pudong.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Zhanghua Factory</h3>
<p>When they arrived at Zhoujiadu in Pudong, the lights were already on. However, they still wanted to see China's only woolen factory, so their enthusiasm was not diminished. Cheng Nianpeng, the manager of the factory, and others warmly greeted them and explained the process in detail. They visited every step, from yarn making to weaving, dyeing, and finishing, until the finished camel fleece and serge were produced. The delegation was impressed by the fact that the pure Chinese-made woolen cloth was as exquisite as imported products, and the low price was even more surprising. Ronald specially ordered two sets of white serge, which he will take back to the Philippines for reference and as a souvenir. According to Manager Cheng, the wool raw materials are purely domestic, from Zhejiang and Shandong provinces. Various patterns are being woven, and more complete patterns will be launched in the shortest possible time. After leaving the factory, they took a motorboat back to Shanghai, arriving at the Xinguang Wharf, where the city was already lit up.</p>
<h3>More Delegation Members Arriving</h3>
<p>The majority of the delegation members and a small number of friendship tour members will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. There are still more than thirty tourism delegation members remaining in Japan. At 8:20 AM yesterday morning, thirteen men and women tourism delegation members arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Great Eastern Shipping Company's President Cleveland. After the delegation members landed, they immediately took the cars that were waiting at the customs wharf to the Astor House Hotel for rest. The remaining delegation members staying in Japan will no longer come to Shanghai and plan to return to the Philippines directly from Japan.</p>
<h3>Leaving for Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>After the delegation was given a public banquet yesterday by the Banking Association and the Shipping Association, they left for Beijing. The Foreign Affairs Office also negotiated with the Railway Bureau to provide a first-class sleeper car attached to the 11:30 PM express train for the delegation to ride. The Railway Bureau sent two receptionists to take care of them on the train. It is also heard that the delegation plans to stay in Beijing for two days and will return to Shanghai by train on the 27th to take the President Lincoln back to the Philippines on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Wenjiang's Remarks</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Wenjiang, the chairman of the delegation, on the trip yesterday. According to him, he is very grateful for the warm welcome from all walks of life in China. The delegation originally planned to visit Zhao Tiezhang, acting director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, and Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, today (yesterday), but due to the urgency of time, he could not fulfill his wish. After returning to Shanghai from Beijing, he will visit them one by one and plans to take the Lincoln back home on the 29th. Wen also said that after inspecting Japan, he felt that the economic situation in Japan was greatly affected by the world economic panic.</p>

<p>Office Closed on May 5th</p>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Borel, Commissioner of Customs, jointly issued two notices yesterday regarding the revision of import tariff regulations and the closure of the office on May 5th.</p>
<h3>Revising the Tariff</h3>
<p>(Omitted above) Now, by order of the government, the provisions of Section 4 of Article 1 of the Import Tariff Regulations should be revised as follows: (Invoices and contracts may be regarded as proof of the price of goods, but they are not necessarily regarded as definitive proof. The interpretation of this point shall be determined by the Customs. In addition to ordering merchants to present invoices and contracts for verification, the Customs may also freely exercise all effective methods, such as inspecting various other documents related to inspection and valuation, investigating detailed sales slips proving both parties, inspecting merchants' books, inspecting goods, and, when necessary, conducting all visits and inviting any private assistance to determine the duty-paid price. The Customs may still inspect the merchants' books at any time for imported goods that have been assessed for duty and released.) You should abide by and handle the matter accordingly. You should inform all merchants, especially to announce this. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Office Closed</h3>
<p>(Omitted above) The Central Executive Committee has stipulated that May 5th is the anniversary of the revolutionary government and should be a holiday. The Customs will be closed on that day and stop working. You should inform all merchants, especially to announce this. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Residents of Zhabei Petition Against Rent Increase</h3>
<p>Residents of Zhenxing Lane on Guangdong Street and the North Sichuan Road area in Zhabei City, approximately one hundred people, were unable to live in peace during the January 28th Incident last year due to Japanese military disturbances and moved elsewhere. However, all the furniture and belongings of these residents were not moved out and remained in the house. At that time, the landlords sealed the houses in the lane. After the end of the war, the residents moved back one after another, and the landlords suddenly demanded that the tenants increase the rent and sign a new lease; otherwise, the seal would not be opened. Some tenants could only temporarily agree because all their furniture had not been moved out. However, these tenants recently opposed the landlord's rent increase, citing that the market in Zhabei City has not yet recovered. The landlord then filed a lawsuit with the local court, which ruled that the tenants should pay the rent in full. The tenants were dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Suzhou High Court. On the 20th of this month, the court decided to conduct a preliminary investigation in Suzhou and decided to first ask the Municipal Land Bureau to investigate the land price situation in the area before making a ruling. The tenants went to the Municipal Government yesterday morning to petition and sent representatives to state the rent situation in the neighboring areas. Secretary-General Yu personally received them and promised to order the Land Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and report it for review and transfer. The representatives left satisfied.</p>
<h3>The Difficult Month of May Is Approaching, Decision to Step Up Security</h3>
<p>Prohibition of Associations, Gatherings, and Parades</p>
<p>Commemoration Days Held by Party Headquarters</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the ill-fated month of May is approaching, the municipal Chinese and Concession police agencies have decided to step up security from May 1st to May 30th in order to prevent reactionary elements from disrupting local security under the guise of memorial days. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Stepped Up Security</h3>
<p>There are many commemorative days in May, such as (May 1st) Labor Day, (May 3rd) Jinan Massacre, (May 4th) Student Movement, (May 5th) Premier's Inauguration as Extraordinary President, (May 7th) (May 9th) National Humiliation Day, (May 18th) Martyr Chen Yingshi's Death Anniversary, (May 30th) Nanjing Road Massacre, etc. In order to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to disrupt local security, Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Public Concession and French Concession police have jointly discussed and decided to step up security from May 1st to May 30th, according to annual practice.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Gatherings</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Public Security Bureau decided to step up security in May according to past practice, Director Wen Hongen has ordered the Inspection Department, the Detective Team, and the police stations in each district to comply. All associations, gatherings, parades, etc. are prohibited. The gatherings of legal groups must be submitted to the competent authorities for approval in advance before they can be held, so that the Public Security Bureau can send police to protect them.</p>
<h3>Holding Commemorations</h3>
<p>The government will simplify the ceremonies for the various revolutionary commemorative days in May during this period of national crisis. The Special Municipal Party Department will only hold commemorations with all sectors of society at the Party Headquarters on Lin Yin Road in Ximen in accordance with the revolutionary commemoration methods stipulated by the central government, such as (May 1st) Labor Day, (May 5th) Premier's Inauguration as Extraordinary President, and (May 18th) Martyr Chen Yingshi's Death Anniversary.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Talks with Returned Overseas Chinese Fan Changfeng</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Support for Aviation to Save the Country</p>
<p>Japanese Actively Operate in the Philippines</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, since the Philippine Industrial Delegation arrived in Shanghai, various agencies and groups have expressed a warm welcome. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter, in view of the fact that readers want to know about the situation of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, interviewed Fan Changfeng, an overseas Chinese who had recently returned from the Philippines, at the Global Chinese Workers' Union yesterday. With the introduction of Peng Canxian, the executive director of the union, he discussed the recent situation in the Philippines in detail with Fan. The following is a summary of the talks:</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines</h3>
<p>There are approximately 90,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, mostly from the Southern Fujian counties. Cantonese only account for about three-tenths. Currently, due to the low prices of Philippine native products such as sugar, coconut, coconut fiber, and wood, and the weak purchasing power of the local people, the business of overseas Chinese has also been affected. However, due to the value of gold (one US dollar can be exchanged for two Philippine pesos), one Philippine peso is often worth two and a half Chinese dollars. Therefore, according to a survey by Xiamen Bank, the total amount of money remitted back to China by overseas Chinese in the Philippines each year can still maintain a considerable figure. There are only about 90,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, accounting for only one-seventh or one-eighth of the total number of overseas Chinese. However, they are the most enthusiastic in donating to national affairs. For example, during the January 28th Shanghai War, when the 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese in Shanghai, they remitted more than 800,000 dollars in one month, accounting for one-sixth of all overseas Chinese donations, which shows their enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Southern Advance and Northern Advance</h3>
<p>The Japanese aggression abroad is divided into the Southern Advance and the Northern Advance. The Northern Advance refers to the operation of Manchuria in China, while the Southern Advance refers to the development of the Nanyang Islands. However, the commercial rights of the Nanyang Islands are still in the hands of overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese deliberately use the power of the state to attack the overseas Chinese in an organized and planned manner. Because of the losses suffered from the boycott by overseas Chinese in the past, they decided to directly trade with the natives after the Jinan Massacre. They actively prepared for this on weekdays. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident occurred the year before last, after the overseas Chinese in the Philippines implemented a boycott of Japanese goods, the number of Japanese shops has increased instead. For example, in the city of Cagayan, there was only one Japanese shop before the September 18th Incident, but now there are eight. In Iligan, there were only four or five, but now there are more than twenty. At the same time, the overseas Chinese are affected by the depression on the one hand, and the Japanese economic aggression on the other hand. The closure of shops is heard every day. The situation of one prosperity and one decline is very dangerous. It is hoped that the overseas Chinese affairs authorities of our country will pay attention and find ways to remedy the situation; otherwise, the day of collapse is not far away.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambition</h3>
<p>The Philippine Islands are an important island in the Pacific Ocean. The city of Davao at the southernmost tip of the Philippines is just a small place that has just been developed, but the number of Japanese residents has reached 20,000. They buy land in the name of natives and ostensibly engage in agriculture. They build their own docks and warehouses, and ships often sail directly from Japan to the port. The city has a magnificent consulate and a Japanese association, as well as a Japanese-style garden church. They are actively operating and spare no effort. Now, the educated Filipinos regard Davao City as a second Manchuria because of its military deployment, and its ambition is gradually being exposed. This year, the Philippine Congress passed a bill to redeem the land there from the Japanese government at a price set by the Philippine government, and negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Anti-Chinese Sentiment</h3>
<p>The Chinese arrived in the Philippines hundreds of years before the Spanish ruled the Philippines. According to historical records, they had contact with the Filipinos as early as the 13th century. Therefore, the relationship between the Chinese and the Filipinos has always been friendly.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Moreover, more than 70% of Filipinos have Chinese blood. In recent years, due to the popularity of education and the gradual opening of knowledge among Filipinos, and the frequent internal turmoil in our country and the decline in international status, the local natives have a contemptuous attitude towards overseas Chinese. Since the loss of Dong Province due to non-resistance in the September 18th Incident, the Filipinos have shown more contempt for the overseas Chinese. They often scold the overseas Chinese as Manchurian slaves when they meet on the road. Moreover, the Japanese provoke hostility between the Chinese and the Filipinos, creating an anti-Chinese psychology among the Filipinos in order to achieve their conspiracy to seize the status of the overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese in the Philippines often face unequal treatment. For example, Chinese immigrants are often harassed by customs officials and detained in a room called a "water prison." It is said that Mr. Huang Shaoxiong also suffered this hardship when he went to the Philippines last year. Overseas Chinese are almost always rejected by the natives, not only in the Philippines. This is indeed the biggest obstacle to our overseas development.</p>
<h3>Saving the Country Through Aviation</h3>
<p>Recently, the idea of saving the country through aviation has been widely promoted, and overseas Chinese are particularly enthusiastic in supporting it. Last winter, General Weng Zhaoyuan, representing the Chinese Aviation Construction Association, went to the Philippines to carry out association affairs. In less than two months in the Philippines, more than twenty branch associations were established, and approximately 20,000 people joined as members. The membership fee revenue was approximately 200,000 Chinese dollars. Later, the association affairs were suspended due to the merger of the general association. Otherwise, the results would have been even more impressive.</p>

<h3>Aviation Solicitation Reaching Final Efforts</h3>
<p>Hoping to Reach Two Million Yuan by Month's End</p>
<p>General Report to Be Held on May 1st</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Aviation Association originally planned to hold its fifth report yesterday and a general report on the 30th. However, due to a two-day postponement of the fourth report, the fifth report will also be postponed. If all teams can conclude their solicitations by the end of the month, the general report will be held on May 1st. However, according to Wu Tiecheng, the general leader of the solicitation team, if the total amount solicited by the end of this month does not reach two million yuan, a further extension may be necessary. It is hoped that all team leaders will make a final effort to reach the target amount by the end of the month, so that the general report can be held on May 1st to conclude the matter.</p>
<p>In other news, Mr. Ziping of the Hankou American Light Company is enthusiastically promoting national salvation through aviation and actively soliciting aviation members. The Hankou Aviation Association office has received letters from him containing the following: One ordinary member on March 23rd, four ordinary members and four special members on April 4th, and one supporting member, six special members, and fourteen ordinary members on April 19th. The membership fees have been remitted, and he stated that more will be remitted continuously. He also introduced Mr. Xiang, a painter from Jiujiang, to solicit members, and he has already recruited five ordinary members. Furthermore, Mr. Wei Shanfu, Chairman of the Timber Industry Guild (leader of Team 378), sent a letter to the Aviation Association office stating that he is actively raising special aviation donations to purchase the "Timber" aircraft. The following is a transcript of his fundraising appeal: Alas, the brutal enemy, with the nature of tigers and wolves and the cunning of demons, has ravaged our famous cities, decimated our people, and devoured several provinces. North China is in peril. Although a small number of brave soldiers have repeatedly defeated the strong enemy, they are relying on heavy artillery and powerful weapons, while we are fighting them with flesh and blood. Even if we are fortunate enough to win, the sacrifice will be great. Moreover, without air defenses, we are left to suffer the devastation of their iron wings and randomly thrown bombs. The suffering of the masses is indescribable in words. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Currently, national salvation through aviation is the loudest call, and all sectors are contributing enthusiastically. On March 20th, the entire guild resolved in a general meeting to solicit special aviation donations to provide assistance. The following are the resolutions: 1. All guild firms will donate 50 yuan at a time. 2. Managers and assistants will each donate 10 yuan at a time, and shop assistants, students, workers, and porters will each donate 2 yuan at a time. If apprentices are unpaid, the firms will pay on their behalf. 3. Firms with a business turnover of less than 10,000 yuan or capital of less than 1,000 yuan may reduce the donation by half according to the previous clause. The donations will be collected by personnel dispatched by the guild, who will issue receipts to ensure accountability. The national situation is urgent and requires our joint rescue. If the skin is gone, what will become of the hair? It is hoped that my fellow members will enthusiastically support this cause and not treat it lightly. This is my earnest plea.</p>
<h3>Frontline Triumphant News</h3>
<p>Recapture of Fengning, Qian'an, and Lulong</p>
<p>A telegram from Beiping states: "To President [of the Association], I respectfully submit the following victory reports from various locations: 1. According to Bing Chun's report upon returning to Beiping, Sun Dianying's forces have recaptured Fengning. 2.

According to a telephone report from Shixia, Huang Jie's forces have occupied Niangniangmiao and are approaching the walls of Gubeikou. I respectfully report this by telegram." [Signed] Ji Shi, Geng Yun, Zhan Zhao, Noon. Another telegram from Beiping: "Please quickly forward [this message] to the local association, the municipal chamber of commerce, all newspapers, and all legal entities. To President [of the Association], In recent days, the enemy has been attacking in the Gubeikou area. Our General Xu Tingyao's division, led by Division Commander Huang Jie, is resisting valiantly. Fierce battles have taken place, with several hand-to-hand combats with the enemy south of the Badaolouzi, resulting in considerable victories. Approximately two thousand enemy soldiers have been killed, and two artillery pieces have been seized. Furthermore, the forces under the command of Commander-in-Chief Shang Zhen also recaptured Qian'an on [blank] day, showing loyalty and bravery in defending the nation, which is greatly admirable.

This is what we earnestly hope for. [Signed] Liaojihei People's Support Association."</p>
<h3>Li Cishan Telephones Request for Assistance in Manufacturing Flying Arrows</h3>
<p>Li Cishan, a representative of the Northeast Volunteers Support Association who went north to offer condolences, has not sent any letters or telegrams to the association for a long time due to family bereavement. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from Mr. Li from Tianjin, stating: "I have read your kind telegram and two letters. I am deeply moved by your distant condolences. Cishan is staying at home in Tianjin, chanting scriptures and reading books, hoping to reduce my sins or contribute to serving the country in the future. Currently, my sick body is of no use to the world, and I should sever all relationships with society to avoid further increasing my sins. I request permission to resign from all positions, including as a standing director of the association and as a representative for comforting the troops, to fulfill my wish. Has Ya Fu come north? I eagerly wish to meet him. Although there are no unfinished matters to hand over, I should inform the newcomer of what I know. Wang Xiaowu telegraphed about the need for Sun's troops to purchase rubber shoes. I also telegraphed Mr. Wei at the same time. I wonder if it has been dealt with yet? I am very concerned. Mr. Huang Tingyu has visited many times. Originally, I planned to wait for the results of the experiment before making a decision. However, their funding has been exhausted, and they cannot afford the ammunition for the experiment. However, the examination of the products shows that they have made progress compared to the experiment in Shanghai. They claim that the explosive power of the current bombs has reached the point where they no longer form a cone shape, and they can be manipulated as desired. At a time when we are being oppressed by enemy aircraft, it seems worthwhile to try manufacturing them. I have found that there are no machines available in Sun Dianying's rear area. I request that our association allocate two or three thousand yuan to Sun's troops to claim. Then, please have Lu Ziying, the commander of the rear area of ​​the troops, supervise Huang Tingyu to rush the manufacture and transport them to the front line for trial use. If they are indeed effective, then our association should raise huge sums of money to carry out large-scale manufacturing together with Mr. Jiang Guangyan's products, and distribute them to various armies on the front line. According to years of experience, this kind of preparation is more effective than spending millions to buy a plane or support an army. Please have the standing committee deliberate and show me your opinion. Huang's troops have been checked and accepted by the military sub-committee, so there is no need to worry. Zhu Jiqing's troops are isolated in enemy territory, doing what others cannot do, and their spirit and resources are very different from the past. There is great potential in the future, but they are suffering from extreme economic hardship. Our association should provide practical assistance as soon as possible. The transformation of the war situation will be more direct and greater than in Jilin and Heilongjiang. [Signed] Cishan."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Orders All Fishing Areas to Reorganize National Fishing Vessels</h3>
<p>Re-numbering Free in Jiangzhe Area</p>
<p>According to the National Society, the Ministry of Industry believes that my country's fishing industry is declining, and coastal aquatic products are being plundered by strong neighbors. Therefore, it intends to rectify national fishing vessels, re-number them, and improve them. Therefore, it has specially instructed the fishery administrations of Jiangzhe, Jilu, Minyue and other regions to stipulate three measures: (1) The Jiangzhe area will re-number fishing boat license plates from July 1 this year. All license fees will no longer be collected because the Jiangzhe Fishery Improvement Association has already collected construction fees. (2) The fishery bureaus of Jilu and Minyue will also set to start numbering fishing boat license plates from July 1 this year. Each plate will be priced at 30 cents of ocean currency, divided into three types, A, B, and C, for identification. (3) All license plate styles will be stipulated by the Ministry, and the regional bureaus will be ordered to manufacture and issue them themselves to save procedures. The above three measures have been ordered to be complied with.</p>

<h3>Pencil Lead Mine Discovered in Shaanxi Province; International Trade Bureau Chemical Test Report</h3>
<p>Carbon Content Reaches 94 Percent, Better Than Japanese Goods, Comparable to American Goods Shaanxi Province is located in the northwest with vast regions and rich natural resources. There are countless abandoned resources due to a lack of development. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Construction has been actively engaged in surveying and mapping, and has recently discovered a graphite mine (i.e., pencil lead mine) near the Qinling Mountains in the province. The abundance of its mineral resources is surprising to the outside world. However, the authorities in the province are unaware of the price of pencil lead and are not familiar with the sales methods. Therefore, they specially dispatched Zhao Guobin, a technician from the department, to Shanghai to contact the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry to discuss everything. After the bureau conducted a chemical test, it was deemed that the mineral quality was excellent and has been widely promoted. The letter from the Shaanxi Construction Department and the chemical test report of the International Trade Bureau are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Letter from Shaanxi Construction Department</h3>
<p>The original letter from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Construction to the International Trade Bureau states: "Respectfully, this department has recently initiated the graphite mining industry in Shaanxi Province and intends to find a large sales market in other areas. The quality of this mineral has been repeatedly appraised by experts, who believe it is most suitable for manufacturing pencils and carbon rods for electrical purposes. However, information is needed regarding the market price of graphite, whether it should be delivered in Shaanxi or Shanghai, the value of each 100-jin load, and how sales should be conducted before operations can be handled. Your esteemed bureau has comprehensive knowledge of international trade and a thorough understanding of Chinese and foreign commercial information. Therefore, this department has dispatched technician Zhao Guobin to contact you and bring a package of mineral samples for your inspection. We kindly request your guidance and will welcome your assistance in introducing sales merchants. Responding letter from the International Trade Bureau is highly appreciated. This letter is respectfully addressed to the International Trade Bureau."</p>
<h3>Chemical Test Report</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau's chemical test of the sample of pencil lead ore brought to Shanghai, it is believed that its carbon content is comparable to that of American products. It is found that pencil lead ore is a recent discovery in China. In the past, the Chinese market needed this raw material, which was supplied by the United States and Japan. The products from the United States are of excellent quality, with a carbon content of up to 96 percent, and the price is up to 400 yuan per ton. The products from Japan are not as good, with a carbon content of only 70 percent, and the price is only between 130 yuan and 160 yuan per ton. However, when used to manufacture dry batteries, they are far inferior to American goods, often only emitting light for 40 hours before turning red and going out. Now, the carbon content of our country's products is as high as 94 percent, which is almost the same as American goods. Therefore, it is a good opportunity for our country to resist the import of Japanese pencil lead.</p>
<h3>Letter of Introduction to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>After the bureau determined the quality to be excellent through chemical testing and clarified the market price, it sent a letter to the Shaanxi Construction Department and yesterday sent a letter to the Hong Kong Tianhua Pencil Factory to introduce it. The factory is owned by Chinese merchants and is the only pencil factory among Chinese merchants, so it specially informed them that they can use domestic products as much as possible in the future. As for other merchants who want to use this raw material, they can also inquire about the truth from the International Trade Bureau. It is said that this pencil contains a lot of [blank], but the Shaanxi Provincial Government is not willing to announce it. As for the transportation method in the future, it will first be transported from the place of production to [blank] and then transported along the Longhai Railway to Haizhou, and then transshipped to Shanghai.</p>

Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter inquired about this matter from the highest-ranking official of the Directorate General of Posts. According to the talk, the Universal Postal Union is dedicated to handling international postal affairs, and political and diplomatic issues are beyond the jurisdiction of this conference. The rumor that my country will submit the issue of the Japanese instigating rebels to seize postal rights and request sanctions is not clear about the organization of the Postal Union. The current Congress is planned to be held in Cairo, Egypt, in early February next year. According to past practice, a preparatory meeting must be held before the convening of the Congress to review the Congress's proposals. The preparatory meeting will be held in Paris in mid-June.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Informs Municipal Government to Re-Instruct Measurement and Correction Review Free of Charge</h3>
<p>Difficulty in Changing Inspection Fee Collection Regulations The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a letter from the Weights and Measures Association, requesting the Ministry of Industry to reduce inspection fees and waive the re-inspection fee after correction, stating that the inspection fee collection regulations issued by the Ministry of Industry stipulated that the collection fee was twice or several times higher than the various inspection fees previously collected in this city. Also, according to the usual practice, repeatedly inspected instruments, whether qualified or not, must be paid for. If there are slight differences, when they are corrected and sent for inspection, they must still be paid for item by item, which the industry cannot afford. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry requesting to reduce the weights and measures inspection fee collection fee and approve free re-inspection to relieve the industry's difficulties. Yesterday, the Municipal Government received a consultation from the Ministry of Industry stating (the above is omitted): "The regulations for the collection of weights and measures inspection fees have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing, and the Ministry of Industry has announced its implementation. It is difficult to change. However, for unqualified instruments, re-inspection after correction should not be charged separately in order to relieve business difficulties and reduce costs. In addition to the approval, you are hereby consulted to investigate and re-instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to comply with the above."</p>
<h3>Guohua Silk Factory Labor Unrest Alleviated</h3>

They immediately ordered the resumption of work and requested that the parties submit all sections and quietly await mediation. All the factory workers resumed work uniformly from yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Seafarers' Union Investigates the Situation of Workers on Japanese Vessels</h3>
<p>Since the 918 Incident two years ago, the Changjiang class Luoyang, Fengyang, Nanyang, Xiangyang, Dazhen, Daji, Ruiyang, Yueyang, Dafu, Dali and other vessels under the jurisdiction of Nisshin Company have suffered a sharp decline in business due to the fact that the majority of Chinese people do not take Japanese ships and load goods. Except for the four vessels Luoyang, Xiangyang, Fengyang and Nanyang, which are still operating, the four vessels Yueyang, Ruiyang, Dazhen and Daji have long been suspended. More than 400 workers on the four vessels have now no work to do. The two ships Da, Fu and Dali were recently dismantled by the company, and all the machinery and equipment have been transported back to the country one after another. The 175 Chinese workers in various departments of the two ships were also unconditionally dismissed. The Seafarers' Union believes that the livelihood of hundreds of Chinese workers is precarious after this blow, and has now sent people to investigate the situation of workers on the company's suspended ships and submit it to the Central Government for assistance.</p>

<h3>Passerby in Western Suit Helps Police Arrest a Thief</h3>
<p>A stray bullet wounds a student</p>
<p>The Victim Recounts the Incident</p>
<p>At 7:40 the night before last, five bandits suddenly came to the house of Sun Maojian at No. 294 North Henan Road. Three bandits climbed upstairs and used pistols to threaten them to remain silent. Just as they were about to start searching, Sun's mother took advantage of the gap to slip out of the back door and reported to the nearby Constable No. 457 and Chinese Constable No. 2163. The constables arrived and encircled the area, sounding the siren loudly. The bandits became anxious and rushed out the door and fled in different directions. The two constables saw that the bandits were holding pistols and feared being ambushed, so they opened fire. As a result, a passerby in a western suit helped capture a thief named Xu Canxiong. Two gold watches worth 100 yuan were found on his person and taken to the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the suspect to the Third Criminal Division of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Zehan took his seat to interrogate the suspect. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, saying that when the Chinese and Indian constables opened fire, a stray bullet injured a student named Wang. After receiving treatment at Renji Hospital, the hospital notified the police station by telephone. The student is still under treatment and cannot appear in court to testify, so he requested a postponement. The original stolen gold watches were then presented for inspection. Then, according to the victim Sun Maojian's statement in the case, at that time, three bandits climbed upstairs. The defendant slapped me in the ear, and another bandit in black clothes pointed a gun at my neck, threatening me to remain silent and making me lie on the table. The gold watches presented in the case are indeed the stolen goods. Also, according to the witness Jiang Xiaolong, he was a newspaper vendor. At that time, he saw the defendant running away, and someone behind him shouted "Thief!" and chased after him. I also chased after him and then saw a person in a western suit capture him. When asked, the defendant confessed. After Judge Wu verified the confession, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Jointly Stored Valuables in Safe Deposit Box</h3>
<p>Lian Rong Exploits a Vulnerable Person</p>
<p>Devouring All the Jewelry</p>
<p>Rong Li Xiaojun, a young woman residing at 42 Rue Massenet, in her blossoming years, had, around 1929, stored valuable jewelry and her husband Rong Wenhao's valuables in safe deposit box number 311 at Jin Cheng Bank. Lian Rong, her husband's sister, also placed her jewelry in the same safe deposit box. Everything was stored under Rong Wenhao's name. Lian Rong held the key to the box, while Rong Li Xiaojun possessed the impression seal for withdrawals. In February of last year, Rong Wenhao suddenly disappeared. Lian Rong seized the opportunity to trick her sister-in-law into handing over the safe deposit box seal. She went to the bank alone and removed all the items from the box, then stored them under a different name. Last summer, Rong Li Xiaojun, needing jewelry, invited her aunt to retrieve it. Upon opening the box, they found it completely empty, with only four and a half sheets of old newspaper remaining. Initially, Lian Rong refused to admit that the items were in her possession. Later, her son explained the situation to Rong Li Xiaojun, leading to negotiations. Lian Rong repeatedly claimed that because Shanghai was about to become unstable, she had taken the items out and intended to take them to Hong Kong. She also argued that all the stored items were her brother's property, and she was entitled to manage them. However, Rong Li Xiaojun insisted that the jewelry was her private property and could not be devoured by Lian Rong. The two women argued back and forth, unable to reach a resolution. Rong Li Xiaojun then filed a civil lawsuit against Lian Rong, and although the court ordered the disputed</p>
<p>jewelry to be seized, enforcement proved difficult, and the items have yet to be recovered. Now, Rong Li Xiaojun has filed a criminal suit against Lian Rong, seeking to have her prosecuted for theft. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special District Court held a hearing. The defendant, Lian Rong, residing at No. 14, Jue Yuan, at the intersection of Rue A. Cohen and Rue Ha Tong, had been summoned by the court police, but she failed to appear. The plaintiff, Rong Li Xiaojun, then presented her account of how she and the defendant jointly stored the jewelry, how the defendant tricked her into handing over the safe deposit box key, and how all the stored items were taken by the defendant and refused to be returned. Judge Liu stated that the plaintiff had not provided a detailed list of the items taken by the defendant. Therefore, he ordered the plaintiff to provide a list and instructed the court to summon the defendant to appear for a hearing on May 8th in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Requests the Shanghai Municipal Council to Correct the Assessed Rental Values of Properties</h3>
<p>To Prevent Disputes Arising from Water Charges. The Chinese Ratepayers’ Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To the Director-General: Having examined the experimental measures for water charges based on meter readings, effective from April 1st, this Association believes that this is a practical policy aimed at seeking actual costs. However, the rental values upon which the charges are based do not comply with the regulations of the agreement dated December 24, 1931. The rental values assessed by your Council are often higher than the actual values, and in many cases, the water charges included in the rental fees are not deducted. In order to avoid unnecessary disputes in the future, we request that your Council make corrections accordingly." This letter was addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement.</p>
<h3>Businesses Must Be Careful of Counterfeit Tickets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rubber, Hardware, and Vehicle Parts Trade Association sent a letter stating: "Recently, it has been discovered that one of our members, He Xing Firm, was presented with a counterfeit ticket on March 19th when a certain Mr. Jia purchased goods worth 319 yuan. The firm accepted the ticket. Unexpectedly, when the ticket was presented to Yu Yuanzhuang for verification, it was discovered that no such establishment existed. The matter was reported to the Hongkou Police Station for investigation. On April 19th, a similar incident occurred with our member San Tai Firm. Fortunately, the firm acted prudently and sent someone to the money shop for verification while detaining Mr. Jia. Mr. Jia, realizing that his deception had been exposed, changed his expression, feigned needing to urinate, and fled. Fortunately, he was not apprehended. The counterfeit Yu Yuanzhuang ticket has been submitted to the association for record. Shanghai Rubber, Hardware, and Vehicle Parts Trade Association, April 25, 1933."</p>
<h3>Sheng Yuchang Indictment for Seduction and Abandonment Case</h3>
<p>Two Witnesses Appeared in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>The Judge Still Hopes for Reconciliation Between the Man and Woman</p>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, currently residing at 1 Avenue Petain in the French Concession, grandson of the former Qing official Sheng Xingxun, was previously sued in the Second Special District Court by Yan Minghan, Yan Qu Shi, and their daughter Yan Shuangqin, residents of Route de Canton, who hired lawyers Dong Kang and Zhang Zhirang to represent them. They filed a criminal complaint alleging that Sheng Yuchang had seduced and abandoned Shuangqin after a prolonged relationship. On the afternoon of January 23rd of this year, the case was heard by presiding Judge Wang Gangxu of the Criminal Court, who ordered Sheng to provide a guarantor who would ensure his appearance whenever summoned, and instructed both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court before resuming proceedings. This was reported previously. The case remains unresolved due to the ongoing dispute between the parties. Yesterday afternoon, the trial resumed. The plaintiffs, Yan Minghan and his wife, did not attend, but Yan Shuangqin arrived at court with her lawyers, Dong and Zhang. The defendant also arrived with his lawyer, Qiu Fenling. At 3:00 PM, Judge Wang opened the Second Criminal Court and summoned the parties and their lawyers to the courtroom. He first questioned them about their ages and origins. The plaintiff, Yan Shuangqin, stated that she was 26 years old, born on the sixth day of the eleventh month of the first year of Xuantong (1909), and a native of Shanghai. The defendant, Sheng Yuchang, stated that he was 37 years old, from Wujin, Jiangsu, and a businessman. The judge asked Yan Shuangqin if she had attempted reconciliation since the last hearing. She replied that the defendant had not sent anyone to discuss it. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhang, stated that further evidence of abandonment had emerged. He explained that because the defendant had failed to pay the</p>
<h3>Police Rates</h3>
<p>and utilities for two months, the water and electricity to Yan Shuangqin's residence had been cut off. As water and electricity are necessities, the plaintiff informed her lawyer, who sent a letter to the defendant requesting payment. However, the fees remain unpaid. The lawyer presented a copy of the letter as evidence. The judge then asked Yan Shuangqin when the defendant had stopped visiting her. She replied that he had not been there since November of last year. The judge asked her if she still wished to live with the defendant. She replied that she did not. He then asked when their relationship began. She replied between August and September of 1927. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zhang, stated that Yan Shuangqin had been betrothed to Wu Xiusheng since childhood. However, upon learning of her relationship with the defendant, Wu had sent a letter requesting the dissolution of the engagement. The original letter was presented as evidence. Gu Jue knew of the relationship between the two, and both Wu and Gu had been summoned to testify and could be called. The judge ordered the two witnesses to leave the courtroom. He then summoned Wu Xiusheng to testify, first administering an oath. Wu stated that he was 26 years old, from Shanghai, residing at 521 Route de Krug, and currently a fourth-year law student at Soochow University. He stated that he did not know Sheng Yuchang, but he had known Yan Shuangqin</p>
<h3>Since Childhood Through an Engagement</h3>
<p>The judge gave Wu the letter to read, and Wu confirmed that he had written it in February of 1930, upon hearing rumors of her cohabitation with Sheng. He stated that he had sent the letter requesting the dissolution of the engagement. The judge then asked the defendant, Sheng Yuchang, if he knew that Yan Shuangqin had been previously engaged to Wu. He replied that he had not known initially, but later Shuangqin had told him that she had an engagement with Yu Yuanzhuang. He was unable to recall when she had told him this. The court then called witness Gu Jue (female), administering an oath. Gu stated that she was 21 years old, from Shanghai, and worked in education. She stated that Yan Shuangqin was a friend. (The Judge asked) Do you know of the relationship between Yan Shuangqin and Sheng Yuchang? (Answer) I know a little bit about it. Around August or September of 1927, around 2 PM, I went to the Yan's house, and at 5 PM, Mr. Sheng arrived in a car to pick up Shuangqin to go out. Shuangqin invited me to go with them. We went to the Cangzhou Hotel. Later, I saw that they were very intimate, and I felt embarrassed to leave first. I do not know when they returned home. Several days later, I went to the Yan's house again, and Shuangqin told me that after we had been out,</p>
<h3>Mr. Sheng had her</h3>
<p>Stay overnight. (Question) Where did you depart from in the car that day? (Answer) We departed from the Yan's house on Route de Canton. The judge asked Sheng Yuchang, "Do you know the witness Gu Jue?" Sheng replied, "I do not know her. I have never met her." Sheng then said to Gu, "I do not know you." Gu replied, "I know you." The judge then asked Yan Shuangqin, "When you were living with Sheng, were you his wife or his concubine?" She answered, "He promised to marry me." (Question) Did you know if he had a wife? (Answer) He was in the process of divorcing his wife. He promised me that after he divorced, he would marry me. (Question) Was there a marriage? (Answer) He always delayed it, and we never married. (Question) Where did you live together, and where did the money for your daily expenses come from? (Answer) In May 1930, we lived together in the Lafayette Apartments, and he gave me money. (Question) What was the nature of your cohabitation? (Answer) He told me to wait for him.... (Question) Were you marrying him as a concubine? (Answer) No. (Question) Was it cohabitation? She did not answer. The judge then asked Sheng Yuchang, "When did you meet and begin your relationship?" Sheng answered, "I met and began my relationship in May 1930. I met her on Route de Canton. At first, we were strangers, but later,</p>
<h3>We often went to see movies</h3>
<p>and gradually became familiar." (Question) Did you agree to take her as a concubine? (Answer) No. She asked me herself and wanted to marry me as a concubine. However, because I already had two wives at home, I did not agree. (Question) Do you know how old she is this year? (Answer) I know that she is 26 years old this year. (Question) How were her living expenses paid when you lived together? (Answer) There was no specific living expense. She asked me for money, and I gave her some. The plaintiff's lawyer just said that I did not pay the police rates, but I have never paid that fee. (He also said) Her father is a Taoist priest. We first met during a Buddhist ceremony in a temple. (Question) After this case occurred, Shuangqin asked you for three thousand yuan. What was that about? (Answer) After her brother-in-law was kidnapped, I went to see her at the Lafayette Apartments. She was managing her brother-in-law's move, etc. Later, without my agreement, she moved into my house on Guofu Min Road. I tried to stop her, but she said that she had nowhere to go and wanted to live there, and she asked me to give her some money. I said that even if I didn't go, it wouldn't matter. I didn't agree, and then she asked me for three thousand yuan. After questioning to this point, the judge said to Sheng, "You have known each other for several years. It is always best to reconcile." Sheng replied, "I agree to reconcile and am very grateful for the court's good intentions. However, Shuangqin's side also needs to make some concessions." The judge then said to the lawyers of both parties, "It is still best for the lawyers of both parties to reconcile outside the court." Both responded in agreement. The judge then announced that the case would be adjourned for three weeks and ordered the parties to reconcile outside of court. If reconciliation is not possible, then a date will be set for further questioning. The court then adjourned.</p>
<p>The Council, at its executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon around 5 o'clock, deemed them satisfactory.

<h3>Doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine Oppose Taxation of Prescriptions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine is implementing a policy of collecting fees for medicines, equivalent to one cent per prescription. It is said that the implementation has been agreed upon. However, this matter resembles the collection of a surtax. Since the branch is not an administrative agency, it should not exercise this privilege. Various TCM organizations here believe it is illegal and have risen in opposition. They convened a joint meeting of various medical groups the day before yesterday, with over sixty executive and supervisory committee members attending. A presidium was elected, and a unanimous resolution was passed to express opposition. However, the entire body supported the idea of raising funds to maintain the medical association.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange Convenes Shareholders' Meeting Regarding Merger</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and the securities department of the Chinese Merchant Commodities Exchange were ordered to merge last year. Due to issues regarding proportions (the commodities and securities department demanded a 50/50 split in trading volume, while the securities exchange only agreed to a 70/30 split), a suitable method has not been found, and the merger has not been implemented. Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange sent a letter to its shareholders to discuss this matter at a meeting this Sunday (the 30th) afternoon. The letter stated: "To the Director-General: In accordance with Article 55 of the Exchange Law and Article 16 of the Exchange's articles of association, a special shareholders' meeting will be held at the Exchange at 2:00 PM on Sunday, April 30, 1933, to discuss the merger and related matters, as well as to report on the lawsuit filed by Wei Zhu et al. In addition to publishing a public notice, a letter has been sent accordingly. Enclosed are a copy of the meeting agenda, an admission ticket, four voting slips (for and against), and a proxy form. Please verify receipt. As this matter is important, we urge you to attend the meeting in person with your ticket."</p>

<h3>Trial Record of the Axe Murder of Cao Anan</h3>
<p>Around 7:00 PM on May 20th last year (15th day of the fourth lunar month), the incident of Cao Anan being killed with an axe occurred at the Qichangzhan Siming Guild Hall in Pudong. The local bailiff reported it to the court, which dispatched personnel to examine the body, prepare the coffin, and await the arrest and prosecution of the murderer. It has now been learned that this case was a revenge killing. The deceased, Cao Anan, and Zhou Axiang, Zhou Jinshan, Wang Qiugen, etc. were all carpenters and had known each other for a long time. Recently, because Cao Anan did not engage in honest work, he repeatedly borrowed money from Zhou Axiang and others and extorted them on various pretexts. Zhou and others, unable to bear the burden, decided to murder Cao to eliminate future troubles. Zhou Axiang initiated and implemented the plan. After the deceased's mother, Zhou Mei, learned of the details, she filed lawsuits with the local court and public security bureau, seeking a thorough investigation. The bureau ordered the police to arrest Wang Qiugen, and after questioning him, they transferred the suspect to the court for trial. The prosecutor interrogated him, and the facts were confirmed. The suspect confessed in court. Zhou Axiang and Zhou Jinshan are still at large and will be dealt with separately upon their capture. Wang Qiugen was prosecuted by the criminal court under Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Code and Article 253, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requesting a public trial. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Luo Renji specially opened the First Tribunal for trial, and the court-appointed attorney, Sha Xunyi, attended the court to defend the defendant. After the judge took his seat, he ordered the incarcerated Wang Qiugen to be brought before the court. Wang testified that he was 26 years old, from Nanhui, residing at the house of Shen Xukui in Shenjia Nong, Pudong, for four or five years, and had been a carpenter. (Question) Who is in your family? (Answer) I have a mother and a 23-year-old younger brother, who is a coppersmith. (Question) What was the occupation of the deceased, Cao Anan? (Answer) He was also a carpenter. (Question) On what day, at what place, and with whom did you kill Cao Anan? (Answer) Around 7:00 PM on the 15th day of the fourth lunar month last year, Zhou Axiang and I killed him with an axe in the Siming Guild Hall area in Pudong. Zhou Axiang struck first, and then Axiang forced me to strike, so I struck once on the ground. (Question) You confessed clearly in the prosecutor's office that you struck him on the head. (Answer) I really struck him on the ground. (Question) Who initiated the plan? (Answer) Zhou Axiang initiated the plan. At that time, Zhou Axiang asked me to go out with him. (Question) Did the deceased have any grudges against you? (Answer) No. Moreover, Anan and I were cousins. (Question) You confessed to the prosecutor that the deceased was a hooligan who often borrowed money from you and extorted you. (Answer) The deceased did have a difficult relationship with Zhou Axiang. (Question) How did you go there at that time? (Answer) Zhou Axiang asked me to go out for a stroll with him. When we arrived at the Siming Guild Hall area, Zhou Axiang took out an axe and tried to chop Anan. I stepped forward to stop him, but Axiang kicked me down. Zhou then chopped Cao Anan down from behind, and then Zhou Jinshan pressed Anan down. Axiang forced me to chop, but Anan was already dead. (Question) Are Zhou Axiang and Zhou Jinshan brothers? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did Shen Xukui know about it? (Answer) He didn't know. After the judge recorded the testimony, he said to the lawyer Sha Xunyi, "The plaintiff has not arrived today. We will set another date for a continued trial." The judge then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Although the Young Woman Comes from a Poor Background, Her Good Looks Have Brought Her Disaster</h3>
<p>Qian Abing Can Be Described as a Wolf in Human Clothing</p>
<p>After Defiling Her, He Plotted to Sell Her</p>
<p>Wang Yaoshi, a woman from Jiangbei, is currently 18 years old and works as a factory girl at the Shanghai Yong'an Third Cotton Mill, residing on Rue Mequin. Although she comes from a poor background, she is not unattractive. Qian Abing, 23 years old, a fellow villager, seeing that she is young and easily deceived, used seduction tactics and sweet words. On the afternoon of the 21st of this month, around 6:00 PM, he waited at the factory gate. When she finished work, he coaxed her in every way, and she was lured to the home of his friend, Xu Ruyou, at No. 56 Da Tong Road in the New Concession, where she was imprisoned and not allowed to leave. The next day, he forcibly raped Wang Yaoshi and plotted to secretly transport her to Fujian to sell for profit. Unexpectedly, his plan was uncovered by Chinese detectives Fang Qingyun and Bao Tan Chen Jinsheng of the Council Police. The detectives secretly went to No. 56 Da Tong Road the day before yesterday, arrested Qian and Xu Ruyou, rescued Wang Yaoshi, and took them back to the police station separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the case, saying that the police are now prosecuting Qian Abing for the crime of disrupting the family under Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, and Xu Ruyou is also suspected of being involved in the case, and they requested detention. Wang Yaoshi requested that she be allowed to find a guarantor to go out, so that she could be summoned easily at the next hearing. She requested that the case be postponed, etc. Judge Qian Wenji ordered the two defendants to be detained for further investigation in seven days and ordered Wang Yaoshi to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Midwife Cannot Escape Blame as Mother and Daughter Die Tragically</h3>
<p>Midwife Abandons Patient in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Tang Guangyu, a resident of Zhenjiang living at No. 16, Lane 9, Yunnan Road, had a wife named Zhang, who was 38 years old. She was heavily pregnant and about to give birth. At around 7 AM the previous morning, she experienced severe labor pains. Her husband went to the residence of Wang He, a midwife living above the Yichang Incense Candle Shop near the Baxianqiao area of the French Concession, to request her services. After arriving at Tang's house, the midwife took Zhang's pulse and said that she would not give birth until the afternoon, instructing her husband to go out and buy necessary supplies. Unexpectedly, after Tang left, the midwife also returned home, leaving Zhang alone in the room without care. Around 9 AM, her labor pains intensified, and she gave birth to a daughter. When Tang returned home, he found his wife lying on the bed, struggling for breath, with blood everywhere. The child was already dead, and the midwife was nowhere to be seen, causing him great anxiety. In the afternoon, Zhang also died suddenly. Tang immediately reported the matter to the Lao Zha station of the police, who sent detectives to investigate and arrested the midwife. The bodies of the mother and daughter were sent to the forensic examination office on Avenue Petain. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo Wei to the office to examine the bodies, open a case, and conduct an inquiry. The husband, Tang Guangyu, testified that he was 36 years old. When he went out to buy supplies, he specifically instructed the midwife not to leave because there was no one else at home. He was surprised that she had left before he returned, and he found the child dead and his wife suffering greatly. In the afternoon, she also died. He claimed that it was entirely the midwife's fault. Wang He testified that she was 48 years old and from Changshu. She said that she returned home to buy vegetables because no one was at her own home, and she asked the landlady to care for Zhang in her absence. After hearing the testimonies, Prosecutor Guo ruled that Zhang died from postpartum bleeding and the girl died from suffocation after birth. The midwife, Wang He, was suspected of committing a crime and should be prosecuted by the police and sent to the court for investigation. Zhang's body was released to her husband, Tang Guangyu, for burial.</p>

<h3>Regulations for River Steamers Towing Barges Approved by Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Customs Announces Implementation Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tang Hai'an, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai, and Robert Bredon, the customs commissioner, jointly announced the implementation of the previously drafted regulations for Yangtze River steamers and electric boats towing civilian vessels, which had been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The announcement stated that the temporary regulations for Yangtze River steamers and electric boats towing vessels have now been approved by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance for trial implementation. Therefore, the relevant regulations are copied below for the information of all merchants.</p>
<p>The regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Regulations for Yangtze River Steamers and Electric Boats Towing Vessels</p>
<p>(Article 1) Steamers and electric boats operating in accordance with the Yangtze River Trade Regulations and having a long-term guarantee bond with the Customs may tow civilian cargo boats and barges from one treaty port to another, or from a treaty port to a permitted loading/unloading point, subject to Customs approval. However, towing civilian vessels above Yichang and towing civilian cargo boats and barges solely between loading/unloading points are prohibited.</p>
<p>(Article 2) In addition to the required documents, steamers and electric boats towing vessels must obtain a special towing permit from Customs, specifying the type and name of the steamer, the nationality and name of the shipping company, the number and type of vessels being towed, and the treaty ports or loading/unloading points where the towed vessels are loading or unloading cargo. When the steamer or electric boat arrives at the treaty port or loading/unloading point specified in the permit, it must present the permit to the Customs or other responsible authority, which will certify that the permit is for one-time use only. Upon arrival at the final treaty port, the permit must be returned to the Customs for cancellation. Steamers and electric boats towing vessels without a permit will be fined 750 yuan and the taxable goods on the towed vessels will be confiscated.</p>
<p>(Article 3) The manifest of the steamer or electric boat towing vessels must specify the cargo loaded on each towed vessel in detail. The cargo loaded on the towed vessels must be handled in accordance with the rules for vessel import inspection and documentation.</p>
<p>(Article 4) Cargoes loaded on vessels towed by steamers or electric boats from one treaty port to another, or from a treaty port to a loading/unloading point, must be declared to Customs. The assessment and handling of taxes will be carried out in the same way as ordinary cargo transported by steamer.</p>
<p>(Article 5) Steamers and electric boats towing vessels must report to each treaty port or loading/unloading point listed on the permit and submit the towed vessels for inspection. Failure to comply will result in the captain, owner, or agent of the steamer or electric boat being held solely or jointly liable. If the towed vessels and their cargo are being towed to a treaty port or loading/unloading point along the way, rather than to the final destination of the steamer or electric boat, the Customs or responsible authority at the intermediate port should clearly indicate this on the permit.</p>
<p>(Article 6) The number of vessels towed by a steamer or electric boat shall be reported to Customs for review and decision. The decision will be based on the engine horsepower of the steamer or electric boat, the availability of equipment for towing, and the ability to maintain safety in navigation, life, and property. If the steamer or electric boat violates this decision, obstructs navigation, or endangers life and property, the captain, owner, or agent of the steamer or electric boat will be fined up to 750 yuan. If an accident occurs, they will also be held legally responsible.</p>
<p>(Article 7) Steamers and electric boats towing vessels may not add vessels during the voyage without the formal permission of the Customs at a treaty port. Failure to comply will result in the captain, owner, or agent of the steamer or electric boat being fined up to 750 yuan and the taxable goods on the unauthorized towed vessels will be confiscated.</p>
<p>(Article 8) Steamers and electric boats towing vessels and the vessels they are towing must display navigation lights in accordance with the rules for preventing collisions at sea.</p>
<p>(Article 9) If a steamer or electric boat applies to tow vessels loaded with salt, Customs will not approve it without a formal document from the salt administration.</p>
<p>(Article 10) Steamers and electric boats towing vessels must comply with orders from Customs patrol boats to stop for inspection.</p>
<p>(Article 11) The crew of the cargo vessels towed by steamers or electric boats shall be limited to the number necessary for the management of the vessel, and passengers may not be carried.</p>
<p>(Article 12) Steamers and electric boats operating to Changsha and the vessels they are towing must comply with the special regulations for managing vessels in Changsha and Yuezhou during the low-water season in the Xiang River.</p>
<p>(Article 13) Steamers and electric boats towing civilian cargo boats and barges from a treaty port to various inland locations must comply with the regulations for vessels operating in inland ports.</p>
<p>(Article 14) These regulations may be amended as needed.</p>
<h3>National Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption of Stamp Tax for Small Transactions</h3>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce, based on a request from the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance regarding the strict enforcement of stamp tax on small transactions by the local stamp tax bureau. This procedure not only makes transactions overly cumbersome but also places a heavy burden on small merchants. The telegram requested an exemption and uniform compliance from all stamp tax bureaus nationwide. The telegram reads as follows:</p>
<p>To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing:</p>
<p>We have received a telegram from the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce stating that the local stamp tax bureau is enforcing stamp tax on small transactions too strictly. This procedure not only makes transactions overly cumbersome but also places a heavy burden on small merchants. It is requested that an exemption be granted and uniform compliance be sought from all stamp tax bureaus nationwide. After investigation, it has been found that small transactions have traditionally not involved invoices. When a market is busy, it is difficult for shops to issue invoices, and customers are often impatient. Some customers may even leave before the invoice is prepared. Moreover, small vendors of fish, meat, vegetables, and other goods are often illiterate and unable to issue invoices. If stamp duty is promoted and requires them to hire employees to handle this task, the small businesses might not be able to afford it. Therefore, we hereby telegraph to the Ministry to request that the Xiamen stamp tax bureau not force vendors to issue invoices and affix stamps for small transactions when customers do not require them, and that a circular be sent to all stamp tax bureaus nationwide to follow this procedure in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation.</p>
<h3>War Zone Work Research Association Calls for Donations of Comfort Items</h3>
<p>The War Zone Work Research Association, organized by various sectors of society, has issued a letter to various circles of society, stating that frontline soldiers are fighting valiantly against the enemy and soliciting donations of medicines, clothing, shoes, and socks for the wounded, to be sent to the front lines to comfort the warriors fighting against the enemy. The letter states:</p>
<p>Respectfully, since the Japanese invasion has intensified, like a greedy boar or long serpent, they are advancing towards the interior. The pain of national subjugation is imminent. Waging war against the enemy relies on the efforts of the soldiers on the front lines, and providing supplies and comfort is the responsibility of the people in the rear. According to those who have just returned from inspecting the front lines, the troops fighting bravely to defend the country near the Great Wall are facing extreme difficulties, and there is an urgent need for medicines, clothing, underwear, cotton quilts, and shoes and socks. In addition to raising over 1,000 yuan to purchase medicines, there is still no source for clothing, underwear, cotton quilts, and shoes and socks. We know that you have a history of providing assistance and have a fervent enthusiasm for helping those in need. Therefore, we are sending this letter to request generous donations and to encourage your friends and relatives to donate as well. Each item will strengthen our ability to resist aggression. Please send the items to the following two locations by April 30th. Once a sufficient quantity has been collected, we will arrange for their safe delivery to the front lines. If you have difficulty with transportation, please notify us at any time, and we will send someone with a receipt to pick them up.</p>

<h3>Reader Advisor</h3>
<p>Collection of Letters Discussing the Question "Can I Return to the Countryside?" (17)</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Lang Xian of Nanjing:</p>
<p>How can we launch a revolutionary national war under the current conditions?</p>
<p>Congratulations to Mr. Liu Simin for reading Mr. You's response to Mr. Xiong Sheng. I was just about to refute him when I received your first letter, Mr. Liu, which was uplifting. I thought you would be able to point out a correct and bright path forward. However, after reading your long letter for the second and third time, I was greatly disappointed! On the one hand, you acknowledge (the suffering of farmers, naturally is exorbitant taxes and levies… the exploitation of high interest rates… the forcing of opium cultivation by warlords and officials… farmers not owning their land…); and on the other hand, you believe that the masses throughout the country currently have (enthusiasm for a national war and an anti-imperialist war), that now is (the time to fight to the death with Japanese imperialists), and you expect (the masses to rise up and implement national armed mobilization…). Thus, your only solution to (the entire social problem of China) seems to be (armed resistance against Japan). This is the most fashionable argument now, but I, in my ignorance, am truly perplexed! Indeed, no one can deny that China is under the control of imperialism, but China has not yet become a colony directly ruled by imperialist countries. So how do they control us? What is the significance of the existence of feudal forces, warlords, local tyrants, and the comprador class? ... You say (the suffering of farmers, naturally is exorbitant taxes and levies…), so since the vast majority of farmers, who form the foundation of Chinese society, (can deeply feel their own suffering), they (know that local bullies, greedy clerks, and corrupt officials are their enemies). As for what imperialism is and what relationship they have with it, they are still completely clueless at this moment! When Rehe was about to fall, a Reuters reporter interviewed villagers in Miyun on the Pingre Highway behind the front lines, asking for their opinions on the Sino-Japanese War. They replied: (We haven't heard of any fighting there), which is the best proof. This is not surprising at all. They only feel that their suffering is given to them by warlords and local bullies. As for the imperialists behind these demons, except for the people in the Northeast, who have already fallen to the enemy, and the workers and clerks in large cities, where foreign influence directly reaches, they have no opportunity to recognize them, and propaganda alone cannot attract their attention. Mr. Liu, you (grew up half in the countryside), so you probably don't really not know this, right? Then your view is putting the cart before the horse.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>According to the weather forecast from the Xujiahui Observatory at 4:30 PM yesterday, there is a moderate cyclone in the northeastern East China Sea and the Korean Peninsula. Air pressure is rising in the Yangtze River basin, and the weather is gradually improving. Along the coast of the country, the wind is light and shifting, with a possibility of heavy fog. Furthermore, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the local temperature was at its highest 69.1 and at its lowest 61.2. On the same day last year, it was at its highest 69.8 and at its lowest 44.6.</p>
<p>The methods of people like Mr. You are truly escapist fantasies, but I don't think your approach (armed resistance against Japan) is necessarily any more brilliant. This kind of popular movement hidden under the (disguise) of (anti-Japan) on the one hand, struggles to gain sympathy and support from the peasant masses; on the other hand, it still inevitably faces obstacles. This remains a no-win situation. And this (disguise) cannot conceal anything! … Mr. Liu, on this point, (we must ask you to give a clear answer)! (18) Mr. Zhang Hailiang from this city wrote a letter asking Mr. Liu Simin what methods should be adopted to solve the problem of rural China? I have read in your column ("The Problem of Going to the Countryside") from when Mr. You Huaigao advised Mr. Xiong Sheng to return to the countryside, until today (the 17th), the letter from Mr. Liu Simin questioning Mr. You Huaigao and Mr. Zhu Tianqing, and it has stirred up some small opinions in me. I feel that you gentlemen have written thousands of words, discussing everything from the question of (can one return from the countryside) to the problems of the countryside, and even national crisis. From my foolish brain, I thought that this kind of discussion would definitely lead to a correct solution to the rural problem, or even a considerable solution to the national crisis, but reading through one article after another, I was disappointed! Perhaps other readers feel the same disappointment?</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Liu Simin's discussion, I cannot help but admire Mr. Liu as someone with a correct understanding of modern society. However, in his two letters, he did not discuss what methods should be adopted to solve the current economic bankruptcy in the countryside, although he roughly pointed out that the decline of the countryside is due to the political disarray (this is my guess and not Mr. Liu's pointing out). But he never mentioned a solution, which is what makes me extremely disappointed. What makes me even more disapproving is the commentary on Mr. You's writing, such as "(this kind of disjointed writing is inherently incomprehensible)." It seems to lack the principle of loyalty and forgiveness (I need to clarify that Mr. You Huaigao and Mr. Liu Simin are completely unfamiliar to me). I just feel that when discussing rural issues, it is best to discuss within the scope of the issue, why discuss things outside of the issue? I ask Mr. Liu and the readers if they agree?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I genuinely sympathize with the grand discussions of the other gentlemen, but I think it is not good to be overly pessimistic. No matter what the matter, it can always be salvaged, or it can be improved. Even the current suffering of the peasants, such as the exorbitant miscellaneous taxes, the exploitation of high-interest loans, and the evil deeds of warlords and bureaucrats, are all due to the political disarray. Therefore, if we want to salvage or improve it, we must find a way to put politics on the right track. The reason for the political disarray is mostly due to the extreme weakness of the four hundred million (idiots)! To remedy the problem of weakness, a considerable organization is essential. When I say this, someone will surely say that I am singing a high tune here, but it is not impossible to organize farmers, we just need to promote cooperatives, and modify the organization and facilities of the cooperatives to prevent them from falling into the mistakes of the past. In this way, it may be possible to revitalize the countryside. My humble opinion is like this, what do the readers think?</p>

<h3>Preparations for Establishing a Great Hebei Library in Northern Henan</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhang Ji Helps Collect Books (Xinxiang Correspondence) People in Henan Province, in order to promote social education and save cultural decline, planned to establish a large-scale Hebei Library in the autumn of last year, located in Xinxiang, the center of northern Henan, which has received sympathy and assistance from all sectors of society. The library's preparation situation is described below.</p>
<p>Famous People Initiate The initiators of the library number more than 150. In addition to people from Henan Province and those related to Henan Province who are happy to participate, many people from all sides who sympathize with the library's proposition have also joined one after another, striving to support it. Zhang Ji, Shang Zhen, Zhang Fang, Liu Zhenhua, Qi Zhenru, Li Wenhao, Li Da, Xu Xinwu, Zhang Guangyu, Zhang Tianfang, Guo Zhonghuai, Tian Xiaoxiang, and Yang Yifeng are all central figures in actively supporting it.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Organization The library's preparatory committee is the highest organ of the library, officially established on February 15th of this year. The chairman is Mr. Hu Yu, the special commissioner of the Fourth District. Under the preparatory committee, there are also fundraising, book collection, and construction committees, responsible for fundraising, book collection, and construction respectively.</p>
<p>Preparation Plan The outline of the library's preparation plan has been approved by the general assembly. It has very detailed designs for popularizing education and improving culture. The library's colleagues deeply feel that the drawbacks of today's school system are hindering the progress of ordinary people and obliterating the individuality of students. They plan to adopt the advantages of the old academy system and reorganize it to adapt to modern trends. However, due to financial constraints, they will temporarily use the library as a base point, and take restoring the spirit of the old academy system as their goal, proceeding in stages, hoping to complete the entire project within seven years.</p>
<p>Raising Huge Sums of Money After the fundraising began, Mr. Liu Jingfu, the chairman of the province, immediately donated a large sum to show his leadership. Subsequently, with the enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society and entrepreneurs from various places, more than 20,000 yuan has been raised, with the business community providing the strongest support. For example, the staff of Tongheyu and other firms automatically donated more than 1,000 yuan in just a few days, which can be described as enthusiastic about education. According to the library staff, the most diligent fundraisers this time are Zhang Fang, Li Wenhao, Li Da, Hu Yuwei, Wang Yanqing, Guo Zhonghuai, and Yang Yifeng. The remaining fundraising committee members are still actively soliciting donations, and it is heard that a large number of donations will still be received soon. As soon as the experts have drawn the design drawings, construction will begin on the new library base on West Street in Xinxiang City.</p>
<p>Zhang Ji Collects Books The chairman of the library's book collection committee is Central Committee Member Zhang Ji. Mr. Zhang is the earliest initiator of the library and is most concerned about the preparation matters. Currently, the book collection work has been actively started. In addition to the initiators Tian Xiaoxiang, Guo Zhonghuai, Yang Yifeng, and others generously donating all of their family's book collections accumulated over generations, the Xinxiang Education Bureau has also transferred more than 5,000 volumes of Ming Dynasty Buddhist scriptures to the library for safekeeping. The total number of volumes has exceeded 20,000. A few days ago, Chairman Zhang Ji returned to Xinxiang from Beijing, and during his spare time, he sent letters to domestic cultural organizations, central ministries and departments, and publishing circles, asking them to donate as much as possible. It is heard that many places are donating all of their valuable publications. Therefore, the registration and thank-you work of the library's collection group is extremely busy. In the future, when the new library is completed, Henan's cultural organizations will have another new force.</p>
<h3>Li Ximou, Commissioner for Educational Inspection in Europe, Reports on Vocational Education in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Vocational Education Takes Elementary Education as Its Foundation, Elementary Schools Must Have Wood and Metal Workshops. Our Country Should Establish Vocational Education with Several Years of Skill Training in the Later Stages of Elementary School. On April 24, at the Ministry of Education's Commemorative Week, Li Ximou, who returned from inspecting Europe, reported on the issue of vocational education. The scope of vocational education, its breadth, has no fixed definition. In its broad sense, all school courses that emphasize vocational training can be called vocational education, such as the training of lawyers in university law departments, the training of engineers in engineering departments, and the training of teachers in normal schools, all can be called vocational education. In its narrow sense, it can be limited to the education and training of manufacturing and daily necessities artisans, such as carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, etc. Modern vocational education in Europe, although it does not include university specialty training and normal school education, commercial schools and agricultural schools are indeed recognized as a type of vocational education. Therefore, the so-called vocational education actually includes commercial, agricultural, and miscellaneous occupational education and training. In the past, professions in our country were also divided into categories, forming a separate line or industry. Within a line or industry, there were also business methods and craft skills, but their organization and habits were mostly based on apprenticeship, without school education and training in the theory of various industries. Therefore, there were professions, but no so-called vocational education. Vocational skills were only passed down between masters and apprentices. Before the 19th century, the situation in Europe was similar to that in our country, with apprenticeship and no so-called vocational education. However, since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, family handicrafts have gradually been eliminated, and the use of machines has expanded day by day. Ordinary workers, without considerable training, cannot cope with the complexity of machine construction and the skillful use of machines. As various manufacturing industries have developed day by day, they all want to sell their products in the world market. Therefore, in order to seek progress in skills and reduce costs, for these reasons, the rise of vocational teaching in Europe was a natural result. The underdevelopment of vocational education in our country to this day is also due to these reasons. The manufacturing industry is not developed, or the products are not sought to be sold in the world market, there is no competition in skills, so there is no need for vocational education. At a minimum, domestic manufacturers have not yet seen this. The facilities for vocational education in various European countries are quite uneven, because each country has different social conditions, habits, and educational systems. In terms of nature, there are vocational continuation schools and vocational specialty schools. Vocational continuation schools are specially established for young employees in factories, firms, etc. Most European countries have laws stipulating that all young men and women under the age of 18 who are employed must attend continuation schools. These courses are either taught at night, three times a week, totaling about eight to ten hours, or taught during the day. All clear-headed factory owners and shopkeepers know that increasing the knowledge of their employees can directly increase their efficiency in service, so they are happy to let their employees study in vocational continuation schools, and some even allow them to take continuation classes during working hours without deducting their salaries. Vocational specialty schools are schools where students are completely taught in schools, and advanced vocational schools. All young men and women must attend vocational continuation schools after completing compulsory education and taking up employment, or seek further education and enter secondary schools, or take up vocational training and enter junior vocational schools. Those who enter advanced vocational schools must have studied in secondary schools to the sixth grade, and sometimes must have practical experience. Among the countries visited by this educational inspection group, Germany and France can represent the facilities for vocational education in continental Europe. The British vocational education system is similar to that of continental countries. The Soviet Union focuses on agricultural and industrial training, so its system is also more special. The division of subjects in various types of schools depends on their level and nature. For example, in vocational continuation schools, all entrants are already employed, so the subjects taught mainly focus on supplementing the students' theoretical knowledge of their professions. Junior vocational schools are for the training of craftsmen in various manufacturing industries, so the classification is very detailed, such as shop assistants, typists, bookkeepers, carpenters, masons, shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths, jewelers, cabinetmakers, engravers, printers, bookbinders, photographers, designers, weavers, knitters, embroiderers, and housework, even barbers and waiters. In the city of Hamburg, Germany, there are a total of 70 lines, and in Vienna, Austria, there are 90 lines. Advanced vocational schools are all for the training of engineering and advanced manufacturing personnel, such as civil engineering, architectural engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, manufacturing engineering, as well as senior commercial and agricultural personnel. The British vocational continuation education has junior vocational education classes, taught either in the evening or during the day. Junior vocational schools include junior industrial, junior commercial, junior agricultural, and junior art schools. In terms of advanced vocational schools, there are specialized higher vocational schools. However, British vocational schools generally emphasize the theory of vocational training, while practical training in the profession is still undertaken by factories or shops. This is one of the most significant differences from continental European countries.</p>
<p>In continental Europe, the so-called vocational schools must emphasize both theory and workshop work, and sometimes even emphasize workshop work. When students are practicing in the workshop, the time spent on their work, the quantity of raw materials, and the value of the finished products must be recorded and examined, so as to resemble the workshop system. It seems that when students leave school and enter factories for employment, there will be no separation and unfamiliarity. Russian vocational education focuses on the training of the agricultural and industrial classes, so its facilities are not like those of England, nor are they like the continental European system. Within factories, there are often joint schools, mostly with night classes. There are preliminary industrial knowledge classes, divided into twenty lessons, specially designed for workers without engineering knowledge. There are special youth classes, specially designed for the children of workers who have graduated from elementary schools. The teaching time is from April to half a year. There are youth industrial classes, designed for middle school graduates. There are worker classes, designed to train workers who already have skills. The teaching time is from two to two and a half years. There are worker colleges, specially designed to prepare workers for university, with a teaching time of four years. The situation in Russia, where workers lack school education, is quite similar to that in our country, so its facilities for vocational continuing education and training seem to offer many points of reference. There are not many vocational schools in Denmark, but the Arts and Crafts College in Copenhagen has an electrical engineering department that can be graduated in ten days, a steamship and fishing boat driving and repair department that can be graduated in two weeks, an automotive engineering department that can be graduated in ten weeks, and an internal combustion engine department, including automobiles, airplanes, and machines, that can be graduated in ten weeks. There are also blacksmithing, metalworking, iron bed, woodworking, and cabinetmaking departments, with graduation periods ranging from two weeks to ten weeks. The internal facilities are extremely complete, and students can obtain sufficient practical experience. It is also a special school for vocational training. Here, one point that must be supplemented is that in various types of vocational schools in European countries, in addition to vocational subjects, common sense, such as civic education, the national language, and physical education training, are all compulsory subjects. From this regulation, it can be seen that European countries attach great importance to national education. However, vocational education is still based on elementary education, so the success or failure of vocational education is greatly related to elementary education. In European countries, elementary schools must have wood and metal workshops. Students in the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades of elementary school practice woodworking, metalworking, and the use of machines in stages. Therefore, all elementary school graduates already have considerable craft knowledge and skills. If our country wants to establish vocational education, especially in industrial vocational education, the</p>
<p>starting point may still be the skill training of students in the later years of elementary school.</p>
<h3>Duan Xipeng Talks About the University Unrest in Guangdong and Prevents It from Expanding</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Central, 25th) Duan Xipeng, Vice Minister of Education, told reporters on the 25th that the Ministry of Education had sent a telegram to inquire about the university unrest in Guangdong. The local authorities have not yet replied, so the method of handling it is still undetermined. However, the Ministry of Education will find ways to prevent the unrest from expanding, he said.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Staff Bid Farewell to Minister Zhu</h3>
<p>Duan Xipeng Delivers a Speech, Zhu Jiahua Responds. The central government has appointed Wang Shijie to succeed as Minister of Education. The Ministry of Education has rushed to complete the handover and is preparing to transfer. All staff of the Ministry of Education, in order to express their gratitude to Minister Zhu Jiahua for continuing to serve as Minister of Education during the period when Weng Wenhao resigned as Minister of Education and did not take office, and for six months now, held a farewell banquet for Minister Zhu at 12:00 noon on (the 24th) in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education to express their farewell and leave a memory. During the banquet, Vice Minister Duan Xipeng first delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude for Minister Zhu's leadership and efforts to improve national education, and hoping that Minister Zhu would continue to provide guidance. Minister Zhu Jiahua then delivered a speech, stating that during the national crisis, the education policy determined by the central government was to revitalize the nation. For more than a year, colleagues in the ministry have unanimously worked towards this goal. Although faced with financial exhaustion, they have made every effort to reorganize universities across the country, improve primary and secondary schools across the country, and promote social education. The capital is the national cultural center, and the ministry has specially prepared the Central Library and the National Museum, and convened various expert meetings to improve the culture of the capital. The central education funding has been specially approved by the government to increase by more than 100,000 yuan in the past year to maintain education. Education is the foundation of saving the country. I am grateful for the help of everyone in achieving the past progress. However, what I am most uneasy about is that the ministry's funding is still only receiving 50%. The arrears of salt tax in Zhejiang Province are not being paid, and the ministry's financial problems are really impossible to solve. This is what I hope the new minister will be able to resolve properly in the future. The event ended happily around 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>Discussing Fund Issues and Publication Matters. Cheng Qibao Reports on His Inspection of European Education. Since the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Education Society was organized and established by Zheng Xigu, Liu Zhanen, Dong Renjian, Zhang Zhongren, etc., it has made many contributions to the cause of education.

<h3>Chu Hui Seng Discusses the Difficulty of Independent Education Funding</h3>
<p>Russian Boxer Indemnity Funds Encounter Problems, Peking University's Finances Affected and Difficult to Maintain. Boxer Indemnity Funds Have Been Diverted Elsewhere, Cultural Undertakings Can Only Use Interest. The Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff, in order to safeguard the independent education funding movement, specially appointed Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, Zhang Xiangyong, Zheng Hongnian, and Zhu Hui Seng, etc., to liaise with the government and relevant parties, to ensure the independence of education funding at all times and in all matters. A reporter from the "Shen Shi" newspaper specially visited Mr. Chu at his residence, and was granted an interview. The reporter first inquired about the progress plan of the case. Mr. Chu replied that although the association had elected colleagues to plan the event, it had not yet received a formal notification, and even after the notification arrives, the association has not yet decided whether to accept it, given the complexity of the case. When asked about the current financial situation of the various schools, Mr. Chu replied that Peking University was originally maintained by the Russian Boxer Indemnity, but now that the funds have encountered problems, there is a great concern that it cannot be maintained. As for the British Boxer Indemnity, according to the agreement, it should also be used for cultural undertakings, but most of it has now been transferred and diverted by the Ministry of Railways, and the rest has been borrowed by the Huai River Guidance Association. In terms of culture, only the interest can be used in the future, and it is still doubtful whether the interest can be received monthly. When asked about the representatives who have been recommended, even if they have not yet accepted the recommendation of the association, what is your individual opinion on this matter, Mr. Chu replied that it is difficult to decide on this matter before discussion. However, the only way out is still to find a way within the return of the Boxer Indemnity from various countries, otherwise, even if we liaise with the government and relevant parties, it will be difficult to achieve the goal in fact.</p>

<p>Amateur Group A Pistol Shooting</p>
<h3>Sino-Portuguese Master Finals First Day Li Gongying Plays</h3>
<p>The Opponent is Medina</p>
<p>5:30 PM and 9:15 PM</p>
<p>First Match 1000 Points, 500 Points Each Before and After</p>
<p>The two leading figures in the Shanghai amateur pistol shooting world are the Chinese "Pistol King" Li Gongying and the Portuguese Medina. The two have met in the Shanghai amateur Group A pistol shooting finals four times. In 1930, the first time they met, Li defeated the Portuguese to win the championship. In 1931 and 1932, the Portuguese won twice and won the championship. This time will be their fourth encounter. These two Sino-Portuguese masters have their own merits. Judging from the usual situation, Li can certainly gain the upper hand, but in formal competitions, unexpected facts often occur due to psychological changes, so it should be treated differently from usual. Regardless of who wins or loses this time, in terms of skill alone, the two have reached the pinnacle, which is indeed the most interesting and exciting scene in the whole game. The final consists of a total of 2,000 points, divided into three days. The first to reach the full score wins. Today is the first day with two matches, each with 500 points, at 5:30 PM and 9:15 PM at the Amateur Pistol Shooting Association inside the Lianhua General Association at No. 3 Beijing Road. The admission ticket for each match is one yuan.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>National Flower</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>How beautiful the flowers are; using flowers to represent a country is called a (national flower), which is especially beautiful and lovely. Because the magnificent land is as beautiful and lovely as a flower, people cannot but love this (national flower) that represents the country. In the past, the Chinese people's love for flowers differed; Tao Yuanming loved chrysanthemums, saying they were flowers of recluses; Zhou Shulin loved lotus flowers, saying they were flowers of gentlemen; Lin Hejing loved plum blossoms, even treating them as his wife; Pi Rixiu loved peach blossoms, also calling them beauties. Nowadays, people are different, blinded by fame and fortune, who doesn't desire wealth? It's not just friends who say (dying under a peony flower is worth it, even as a ghost), but advocate that this flower of wealth! The peony! Should be the national flower, opposing plum and chrysanthemum as the national flower. The world is so turbulent, and most people's minds are like this, which shows our (national character).</p>
<p>England uses the rose as its national flower, and France uses the lily as its national flower, both bearing the colors of commemoration or representation of national character. Only Japan actually uses the cherry blossom as its national flower. In the early summer of the island nation, cherry blossoms are gorgeous. They call it the (Cherry Blossom Festival), which is very lively. In fact, cherry blossoms are even more frivolous than peach blossoms. They cannot withstand wind and rain, nor can they endure cold. The period of showing off is very short. Is this the shadow of the violent sun? Moreover, their cherry blossoms have flowers but no fruit; they have appearance but cannot be eaten. Isn't this a sign of hatred for goods? As early summer approaches, wheat shows its green ears, and cherry blossoms adorn the red trees. It is their season of pride. Unfortunately, once the plum rain season arrives and lotus flowers emerge from the water, of course a burst of red will pass away, and the flowers will fall and people will die. Who will bury the flowers?</p>
<p>I heard that the Japanese regard sorghum as the national flower of the puppet state, which is really wishful thinking. Sorghum flowers, what beauty do they have that can be a national flower? But sorghum can be squeezed to make wine. Aren't the Japanese treating the three northeastern provinces as sorghum, squeezing their people's fat and oil? It's a pity that a bunch of puppet state monarchs, ministers, generals, and soldiers are dreaming their golden dream every day and refuse to wake up. Using sorghum as the national flower is not as good as simply using (golden dream) as the national flower!</p>
<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Recently, in various literary publications, apart from (peeling cocoons) patriotic remarks and disguised (sister, I love you), the most fashionable are (returning home ○○) and (hometown ○○) articles. That's right, this kid also has a hometown. This kid's hometown also occupies a considerable position on this earth. This kid's hometown, although not Suzhou or Hangzhou, which are famous all over the world, nor the Eight Character Bridge or Xiao Chang Temple, which were made famous by the Imperial Army, but it has the same people, dogs, crows, bedbugs, local tyrants and evil gentry, local ruffians, free-loving girls, and farmers who go bankrupt in good years.</p>
<p>Although this kid hasn't returned to his hometown for three years, the green mountains that woodcutters cut down every day and the green water that citizens drink and wash their chamber pots with haven't tasted the flavor of the enemy's iron hooves. I think they haven't changed color. The five-foot wide (main street) where (a sedan chair passes by in the street, and three-foot infants also stand guard) I think still maintains its antique charm, (China's inherent culture).</p>
<p>The large and small earthen mounds that the declining poets admired, as mentioned by the new scholars, I think have made a lot of progress in quantity in the past few years. Poets and writers, after seeing the endless (tomb landscape), may have (A Night Visit to the Tomb) and other (immortal works) included in (Eating, Sleeping, Playing with Women's Leftovers). If the modern futurist painters see the scene of (widows sweeping graves), they may produce a (cone and curve) to be displayed at the French (Spring Salon), which will definitely leave a good impression on Westerners of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The wheelbarrow may still have the supreme authority to instill culture, no, there are also sailboats, which can be said to be evenly divided. Quinine to fight malaria and smallpox medicine to extinguish tiger epidemics are all gifts given by this means of transportation. The monks with oily hair and slippery faces, the ancient temples rebuilt by alms, the jungles with collapsed walls and excrement everywhere, may still be (quiet and secluded), hometown, I dream of traveling there.</p>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>We know that the Boy Scouts, after Mr. Baden-Powell's extreme efforts and promotion, were conceived and born with this term; in the boundless sea of people, this loyal servant was born; our Chinese Boy Scout cause is naturally undeniably immature at present, but it has been quite active in the past two years. There have been quite a few people who have written about the records of Boy Scout operations in newspapers, but the most interesting thing about its body is nothing more than camping in the spring suburbs; but a cursory inspection and a distant view of the mound-like camp from a tall building cannot understand everything it wants to let people know.</p>
<p>I have visited the campsite of the Girl Scouts. They use the naturally beautiful countryside, take economical, simple, and hygienic environmental things, and provide them with the temporary needs of their lives. They set up tents on the open plains, with ventilation, sunlight, rain prevention, and moisture prevention as the highest principles; as soon as they arrive at their destination, the busiest thing is the construction of the project. They hurriedly set up the tents, and the next thing is a concentrated toilet for excrement. Using four Boy Scout sticks, they successfully created a three-dimensional square on one side not far from the tents. The outside was surrounded by snow-white canvas, and there was also a short door. Outside the door was a pile of loose soil. They said: After each person defecates or urinates, covering the pit with an inch of loose soil can prevent the smell of wood chips from overflowing. Next to the toilet, two square pits two feet deep were dug. All banana peels, melon seed shells, fish bones, and meat bones were dumped in them, which was a temporary trash can, and the outside was also covered with a layer of loose soil. It was really (gold and jade on the outside, trash on the inside).</p>
<p>The most artistic structure is the open-air dining room. A piece of ground the same size as a square table is dug into a trench on all sides. The buttocks are on the ground, and the legs hang down. When you sit down, you can just accommodate your knees; a piece of lead painting paper is spread on the beach, and the four corners are nailed with drawing pins. From a distance, it looks like a snow-white square tablecloth; if there are many people camping, it is simply a miniature of a city restaurant; they fan the green tree branches as chopsticks, I think if they compete with foreign Boy Scouts to eat? I guarantee that the blond-haired and blue-eyed children will be helpless.</p>

<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Brewing Tea to Spend the Long Night, Enjoying the End of the Year; The Title Marks the Anti-Japanese Day, the Shouts are High</p>
<p>Guizhi felt that her mother's words were a bit too sentimental. Old Man Zhao was an old-fashioned person, and he might not be happy, so she smiled and said, "Grandpa probably won't move out after living here for a few months. We don't have anywhere to move to. How can we not be together next year?" Old Man Zhao understood Guizhi's intention, so he picked up his wine glass and smiled, "I hope it will be as the big girl said! Big girl, don't you dislike being neighbors with old-fashioned people like us?" Guizhi smiled and said, "What are you talking about? Neighbors like you are really one in a thousand, one in ten thousand, you can't pick them out!" Old Man Zhao smiled and said, "That's good, let's live together forever." Saying that, he picked up his wine glass and raised it to Guizhi. Only then did Guizhi's heart move, and she felt that her words were a bit inappropriate, and people had caught her in the rear. But the old man had raised his glass, and she couldn't ignore him, so she had to accompany him and take a sip from the glass. Old Man Zhao was very happy tonight, talking endlessly and drinking a lot of wine. Jiang said with a smile, "Old man, you forgot what Company Commander Zhao said before he left, you can drink wine, but don't get drunk." Old Man Zhao smiled, pushed the table and stood up, nodding and said, "You are saying good neighborly words, I won't drink anymore." The Jiang mother and daughter also stood up. Old Man Zhao's face was red, and his beard was half-cocked. He crossed his hands and blocked the way, and smiled, "We agreed in advance that after eating, we will brew a pot of tea and eat New Year's snacks, you can't leave." Jiang looked at the appearance, Old Man Zhao was already a little drunk. You can't provoke a drunk person, it's better to accommodate him when something happens, so she said, "Okay, let's bother you here for a while." Old Man Zhao let the mother and daughter sit by the stove in the house, busily brewing tea and filling snack plates, and then sat down on a wicker chair a little farther away, and smiled, "Although I am an old man, I have to talk about men and women not handing things directly, otherwise, the big girl won't be willing to sit here." Eating mutton and drinking liquor makes you thirsty easily, drink. He swayed his body, opened the top cover of the iron stove, and put a large tin of hot water on it. Guizhi was afraid that he would not put it properly, so she stood up to put it for him, and he quickly stopped her with his hand and said, "Just now you said you would live with us forever, and in a moment, you will leave."

<h3>Shorthand from a Car</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Because I wanted to be early, the old man woke up early in the morning. Was he too anxious? Arriving at the station, buying a ticket and entering the train, he sat and waited for an hour. If I had known this, why did I have to get up so early!</p>
<p>The continuous spring rain has caused travelers to constantly curse the heavens. However, amidst the surrounding dark clouds, it was as if a ray of sunlight suddenly shot out when it was about to rain, causing all the passengers in the car to show a kind of lucky color on their faces.</p>
<p>In the miscellaneous luggage and travel equipment, we can make a simple analysis of the travelers! Elegant scholars going to Hangzhou to enjoy the spring; Catholics going to Sheshan to worship; Buddhist disciples going to Tianzhu to offer incense; orphans, widows, and children returning home to visit graves, each with different purposes, but I am an exception, because I am going to visit the sick!</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman with disheveled hair, holding a piece of paper with a few lines of words in her hand, complained to the passengers. Isn't that the mother we met in the car the last time we went to Hangzhou? Ah, this is also a skill, nothing more than begging as a business, but smart travelers saw through her tricks, and no one was willing to open their wallets, leaving her empty-handed.</p>
<p>Three young people suddenly dug out a deck of playing cards and played cards on top of a small suitcase. This is also a kind of pastime on the journey, which can reduce the loneliness of the journey somewhat, right?</p>
<p>Arriving at Xujiahui, on the platform, two teams of people walked in: one team was the "Mrs. Army," carrying yellow cloth bags and holding a lot of incense and candles; the other team was the "Black Shirt Army," wearing crosses on their chests and holding Bibles in their hands. The people were half Chinese and half Western. Burning incense and worshiping, Hangzhou and Sheshan, what's the difference!</p>
<p>An elderly couple, although over half a century old, the man in a brand-new gown and the woman in a cheongsam and leather shoes, whispered sweet nothings in the car, not diminishing the style of their youth in the slightest, only making the lonely travelers envious.</p>
<p>Songjiang has arrived, let's get off the train, shall we? Never mind! Let this idle account end halfway at the same time, shall we?</p>
<p>World Rare News</p>
<p>Can Understand a Hundred Kinds of Dialects</p>
<p>German linguist Dr. Rothas can understand the national languages ​​of the whole world, including ten Germanic languages, eleven Romance languages, fourteen Slavic languages, twelve East Indian Germanic languages, four West Indian Germanic languages, eleven Finno-Ugric languages, fourteen Asian languages, fifteen Indian languages, fourteen Semitic languages, eighteen African languages, six South Sea Island languages, and four American languages. Dr. Luo can speak any of the above 140 national languages ​​at will. One day, at a world conference, he changed his voice at any time and answered the representatives of more than 50 participating countries fluently, making the representatives dumbfounded. It is said that he also understands the Basque dialect, so everyone recognizes him as the leader in the field of linguistics and breaks the record of linguistics.</p>
<p>Italian Gas Masks</p>
<p>Italy has recently promoted the purchase of gas masks by its citizens. News across the nation shows cheap gas mask advertisements are commonplace everywhere. This is because when Army Chief of Staff Goshera raised the issue of national defense, there was a proposal to order citizens to prepare gas masks, which is the Fascist ideology, an idea of preparing for war, and was announced to the people in advance.</p>
<p>Hybrid of Cow and Pig</p>
<p>Frank, a merchant in New Hampshire, USA, recently gave birth to a strange beast that is neither a cow nor a pig. However, the animal that gave birth to this strange beast was a twenty-six-month-old cow, but the head and tail are still like a pig, while the body fur, toes, are completely like a cow. After the study of zoologists, it was determined that the cow was a hybrid of a cow and a pig.</p>
<p>Chinese Crabs to Europe</p>
<p>Our country's rivers and seas are full of crabs. It is said that there is a kind of hairy crab that migrates in groups across Siberia, across Russia, through Eastern Europe, and reaches German rivers. Several scholars have conducted on-the-spot investigations and personally saw crab groups migrating over mountains and ridges. The whole of Germany is now carrying out vigorous capture campaigns, and there is even a warning of "Chinese crab plainclothes troops invading Europe."</p>
<p>Relationship Between Sunlight and Feet</p>
<p>British female medical doctor Katherine Boggam recently published a novel theory. She said: The feet of people who are often fully exposed to sunlight are bound to be longer than the feet of people who wear pants and have no contact with sunlight. The reason why Scots are so long is because they wore shorts when they were young, and their legs are fully exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>French King and Wine</p>
<p>Pope Pius XI of Rome is the person with the most wine stored in the world. His largest wine cellar is stocked with more than three thousand bottles of various wines sent from famous producing areas such as France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Hungary, and each year they are regularly contributed by various countries.</p>
<p>Buffalo Drinking Dry River Water</p>
<p>The area around Macpherson Center in Kansas, USA, has suffered from drought for decades, and people and animals are often harmed by the scorching heat. One day, several thousand buffalo suddenly arrived in herds at the Smakshil River, and in less than four hours, they drank the river dry. This is a story from 1866. Now the old people in this place have a saying, "ox drink," which is a metaphor for people's wild drinking, which comes from this story.</p>
<p>Hundred Yuan Worn Shoes</p>
<p>Because of the lack of materials in Soviet Russia, various commodities and daily necessities are unusually expensive. Therefore, the Soviet government has a prohibited price for ordinary materials. For example, an old pair of pants is limited to 200 rubles, a pair of broken shoes is limited to 100 rubles, and a pound of white sugar and butter is limited to 15 rubles.</p>

<h3>Financial Decline and Rebound, Gold Price Returns to Twelve Yuan and a Half</h3>
<p>Canadian Gold Notes Suspended Cash Redemption, Once Reached 900 Yuan</p>
<p>American Bank Sends Members to Moderate Movement, Resulting in Rising Instead</p>
<p>The gold market is still uncertain. It fell and rebounded yesterday, once falling to 899.5 yuan. In the early morning, due to the continued rise in overseas silver markets, exchange rates and American cotton both rose. The gross market opened at 900 yuan. Dadecheng, Daxing, Yongzhao, Fengchang, Zhifeng, and Yong all advanced to 10 yuan. Moreover, because Fushun, Daxing, and Yong also accepted, it reached 14 yuan. Yuanheng and Hengxing then sold, and the opening was 909.5 yuan. The exchange market was hard at the initial opening, and slightly tighter after opening. The gold market also rose. Reuters reported that Canada's order to suspend the cash redemption of gold notes has been passed. Banks were aggressive, and the gold market fell instead, once breaking through the 900 yuan mark, and then rebounded. Foreign wire services reported that American banks sent members to temporarily postpone the movement, and the situation stabilized. Later, the Mumbai market initially rose 26 annas and slightly decreased. Exchange rates</p>
<p>The market is getting tighter and tighter, and it is also being pulled by colleagues. The rise is extremely fast. Moreover, due to the decline in Mumbai of 4 annas, Reuters also reported more favorable news, such as American bank members being silent on the silver proposal. The market rebounded to 42 yuan, and the closing was 939 yuan. The number of buyers in the after-hours market exceeded Heng by a large margin. The exchange market was unusually tight. There were rumors of an increase in silver tax in the market, but it has not been confirmed. In fact, there is still sufficient silver in this port at present, and it seems difficult to fully believe this move. If it is true, the future of hedging is unlikely to be close. The arbitrage price is added at 42 yuan. May-June swap is from 26 yuan to 27 yuan. The market situation of the day is as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 909.5 yuan, down 17 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 9 yuan. The exchange rate was recently opened at one shilling three pence and twenty-five. The US dollar was twenty-four yuan and a half, which was harder than the previous close. Yuansheng and Yong sold to zero-six yuan, Richang then advanced, and Fuchang also bought, and then broke through ten yuan. American dollars for June at twenty-five yuan were difficult to settle. Fuchang, Tianfeng, Yongheng, and Yu all advanced, and the situation rose further. Daxing Yong came again with a fierce advance, and Richang and Shunli also purchased, reaching 18 yuan. The British Bank offered July American dollars at 125 and 1875. Zhifeng, Yong, Dadecheng, and Hengxing sold off, retreating to two yuan and a half. American dollars for May at 5625 were wanted by the bank. Yongfeng advanced to six yuan. Although Bingxing, Zhifeng, and Yong sold, they rose quite fast due to the advancing of Fuchang and Hongli. American dollars for June at 875 were wanted by HSBC. Fuyu, Tianfeng, Yongheng, and Yu all advanced, and then jumped to twenty-two yuan. Hua Bi came out with American dollars for June at 875, and even August at five yuan 375. Heng Yu came to sell off fiercely. Foreign wire services reported news of Canada's cancellation of the gold standard. Yifeng and Yong also sold off. HSBC's listing was announced, with the shilling growing by half a penny, and the US dollar growing by one yuan. Heng Yu repeatedly sold off, and American dollars for August at this half yuan were difficult to sell, and fell to thirteen yuan and a half. Richang advanced, reaching seven yuan. American dollars for July at 25 were difficult to sell. Yifeng and Yong sold to two yuan, although there were more than two yuan returning upwards, but because Citibank came out with July 25, and shortly after 3125, no one wanted it. Fuyu [unclear character] Fa Yong came to sell, gradually going downstream to within ten yuan. The exchange market was extremely loose. People's minds were still good at this time. Richang repeatedly advanced, and Shunli, Dadecheng, and Heng Yu also bought, still at 14 yuan. American dollars for July at 4375 were not of interest. The exchange market was very hard. Chunyuan Yong, Wanxing, Qingfa, Yong, Fuchang, Qianchang, and Xiang tried hard to sell, and for a time people were terrified and sold enthusiastically. In a blink of an eye, the 900 yuan mark was broken, reaching 899.5 yuan (Dadecheng sold 14). The market situation was chaotic. Later, Heng Yu took the opportunity to advance at low prices. Shunli, Hengxing, Zhaofeng, Chang, Yuansheng, Yongqian, Changxiang, and others successively advanced, and then rose to about ten yuan. Later, the bank slightly offset, and American dollars for July at 4375 were difficult to settle.

<h3>Bonds and Public Bonds Rose and Fell Intermittently</h3>

Therefore, the ups and downs in the market were completely [unclear] related. The environmental situation was beneficial to the bulls, and the war seemed to be progressing, and the danger of Tianjin could be avoided, but there were still many floating bulls [unclear], and the market price could not avoid being slightly trance. At the opening in the morning, all gangs bravely bought in, and the demobilization rose sharply by six or seven jiao. Some sold a long-term 19 pass, repeatedly suppressing it, and the market price finally fell from high to low. Therefore, people's minds relaxed, and they all fell back by two or three jiao to more than eight jiao. Gai wanted to settle the floating bulls and floating bears in this month in one day, and they fought each other, so there was this phenomenon. In the second market, people's minds were slack, and the bulls mostly swapped and settled, and the various types listed above all decreased by three or five jiao, but the various types for 20 years were stronger again, and there were some that did not fall but rose instead. The bulls and bears each went their own way, and there were such cases.

<h3>The Crushing Situation in Cotton Yarn Leads to a Sharp Decline in Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market has suddenly turned weak, and the downward trend is intensifying. This is truly due to the unfavorable environment. Even a slight setback causes panic selling among merchants. Recent changes have been particularly drastic, making it difficult to maintain confidence. However, the situation requires careful handling. Factory owners are paying close attention to the yarn market.</p>
<p>(Human Standard Price Drops More Than Two Dollars)</p>
<p>The Human Standard price opened in the morning session, showing a slight increase due to the rise in American cotton. However, the sharp fall in the gold market led to a lack of buyers in the market, causing the price to trend downward. Prices for each month fell by 1.5, 1.6, and 1.9 dollars. The afternoon session remained weak, with long positions being closed. Prices for each month fell by 0.6 to 1 dollar. The total transaction volume for the day was 44,100 bales.

<h3>Silk and Tea New York Silk Market Discovers New High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York telegraph reported that the silk price had surged to a new high of $1.54. However, the US exchange rate also rose simultaneously, so transactions in this port were still very scarce. Transactions included 10 bales of Nanxun 13.15, priced at 800 yuan; 10 bales of Hushan 13.15, priced at 706 yuan. Also, 20 bales of Nanxun 20.20 were priced at 714 yuan. There were also rumored transactions of 83% even 20.20, priced at 730 yuan, but the number of bales was unknown. According to the Yokohama Silk Merchants Association report, as of April 15, this year (starting from July last year), the total export of Japanese raw silk was 426,925 bales, a decrease of 31,443 bales compared to the same period last year. However, trade with Europe increased by 7,659 bales. The French market has always been the base for Chinese silk, but it is now also being occupied by Japanese silk, which is something the silk industry should pay attention to. Attached are the market prices abroad, (April 24): Market, Grade, Price, Exchange Rate, National Currency, New York, Japanese Standard Silk 1.54, 25.00, 754; London, Chinese Silk A, 7 shillings 7.5 pence, 1.3.50, 717; London, Chinese Silk B, 7 shillings 1.5 pence, 1.3.50, 665; Lyon, Chinese Silk A, 89 francs, 5.78, 785; Lyon, Chinese Silk B, 83 francs, 5.78, 730.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silkworms Damaged by the Weather</h3>
<p>(Sheng County) Farmers in various cities and villages regard sericulture as a secondary occupation, and they pay much attention to raising silkworms and planting mulberry trees. Therefore, cocoon production is still excellent. There are 70 to 80 cocoon businesses in the entire county. In recent years, due to the unfavorable weather, silkworm cocoons have had a poor harvest, and silkworm farmers have suffered losses. Last year, sericulture had already declined. This year, rural economic panic is feared, with no funds to purchase silkworm eggs and a significant reduction in the number of silkworms raised. Moreover, most are hatching local varieties retained from their own stock. In the eastern countryside, Jinxi, Pukou, Houshan, Huatang; in the southern countryside, Shangbixi, Cangyan; in the western countryside, Chongren, Ganlin; in the northern countryside, Sanjie, Macha, Shiqiao, Changle, and other areas, the number of families raising silkworms is only about 35%. After collecting the silkworm eggs, the weather was cold, causing poor development of the silkworms. Coupled with continuous rain, the early silkworms began to change after the second sleep, with symptoms of jaundice and blackening. The late silkworms also developed white muscardine, with 40% to 50% being discarded. Currently, the early silkworms in the southeast countryside are about to enter the third sleep with vigorous leaf consumption, while the late silkworms in the northwest countryside are also starting to sleep. If the weather remains sunny and warm, the spring silkworms may still have a 30% to 40% harvest. However, with the alternating sunshine and rain, silkworm farmers are generally pessimistic.</p>
<p>(Xin Deng) In recent years, due to the unfavorable sericulture business, although the government has been encouraging the raising of improved breeds this year, due to the scarcity of funds, they are unable to purchase the eggs. Therefore, the silkworm farmers in various villages are currently raising native breeds (i.e., the retained breeds from Yuhang, Xinchang, Zhugui, etc.) and foreign breeds (i.e., improved breeds produced for sale) separately. The number of silkworms being raised has greatly decreased. There are more people raising foreign breeds in the areas of Lutou, Pikou, and the western countryside, while the majority of people in areas like Sanxi Town and Gangkou are hatching native breeds (mostly Yuhang breeds). The weather is abnormal, with spring feeling like winter, and continuous rain for many days. The collection of silkworm eggs is uneven, and early silkworms have experienced abdominal distension and death from eating rain-soaked leaves when they were waking up from their sleep and spreading out to eat. Unhealthy silkworms differ by as much as a week in their development. The day before yesterday, the weather turned sunny and warm, and the late silkworms were about to wake up from their second sleep. However, within two days, it started raining again, and the silkworms are being greatly affected.</p>
<h3>London Tea Market Suddenly Becomes Active</h3>
<p>London Telegraph reports that since April, the long-depressed tea market has suddenly become active. The market prices of Indian and Javanese black tea have all risen. The Hubei and Hunan black tea that had been stockpiled for three years and had not been sold have also been completely sold out. According to general tea merchants, this change in the London tea market is quite beneficial to low-grade Chinese black tea. As for Qimen black tea, British tea merchants suffered heavy losses last year. If the mountain prices are high this year and the costs are significant, it is still difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>High Opening Price for Hangzhou Raw Tea</h3>
<p>Longjing Opens at 720 Yuan Per Picul</p>
<p>New Hangzhou tea has been on the market in recent days. The opening price of West Lake Longjing tea has been raised to 720 yuan per picul, which is 50 to 60 yuan higher than last year. The opening prices of other Shizi Feng Mao Feng green teas range from 280 yuan to 320 yuan, which are also more expensive than last year. The reason is actually due to the cold weather, which has hindered the output of tea, and there are many merchants rushing to buy the new tea, resulting in supply not meeting demand.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Tea Has Also Started Production</h3>
<p>Wenzhou is one of the regions producing green tea. Last year, the tea processing factories in this area had fairly good business. Therefore, tea merchants are flocking to it this year, and the number of tea companies has increased by seven or eight. Since Grain Rain, farmers in various mountains have successively started picking and processing tea. However, due to the unfavorable weather, picking has not been without difficulties. It is expected that the opening prices will be difficult to reduce in the future.</p>
<h3>Food Prices for Rice Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was drizzly, with only one or two dozen boats arriving. The market was tight at first, but later it became stagnant due to the lack of customers. There was not much outgoing traffic on this street. Fortunately, the supply was scarce, and Qindao and Yantai continued to handle more than 1,000 packages of Sutong Japonica. However, only the Qingjiao group had two loads of Boodha rice, and Songjiang had one load, totaling three to four hundred packages, which presented a fresh situation. The market prices of all the thick Japonica and Boodha rice were slightly higher by several cents. Looking back at the overall situation of the market today, the reason for the continued rise is due to the smaller arrival of goods and the rainy weather. Du Yangjian and Yin Bian Yuan have been stalled due to the street's digestive issues, and have remained stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Seventeen or eighteen ships arrived from various groups. The turnover of white Japonica was limited due to the continuous drizzle, and only a few piculs were sold. The high-quality goods have not opened yet. The market for mid-grade goods is slightly tighter. Indica and Baiyuan have all shown stability. Early Boodha rice is lacking in arrivals.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Continues to be Actively Handled by Local Merchants</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the local and Fuzhou and Ningbo groups had appetite for foreign rice. Because people are hoping for a good market, the owners are holding firm on their goods. The quality of the goods has improved slightly. Little Twist Rice opened up to 7.4 yuan, which is a whole dime and one cent higher than the previous price. Even if calculated based on the high and secondary quality of the goods, it should have risen by 5 to 6 cents compared to the previous market. A total of 2,000 packages were opened. Fuzhou took 1,000 packages, while Ningbo and the local area split the other 1,000 packages. The local area, in addition to Little Twist, also took 1,100 packages of Saigon No. 1. This is the newly arrived Saigon No. 1 rice, which had originally been quoted at 8.15 yuan. Because Chen Saigon had a smaller size, the buyers were only willing to pay 7.8 to 7.9 yuan. Yesterday, the market was improved by the strong sales of Little Twist, and because there was only one batch of new Saigon on the market, it opened up to 8.1 yuan, which is about a dime higher than the market price. However, the owner's intention was to sell it five cents cheaper.</p>
<p>The Min variety of Indica rice and Minhua variety were very active. Fuzhou had the greediest appetite, while Quanzhou and Ningbo only took two to three hundred packages each of late Jiangxi machine rice. The rest was all bought by Fuzhou. A total of 900 packages of late Jiangxi machine rice were opened, priced from 8.0 odd cents to 7.8 yuan. 1,300 packages of Hunan machine red rice were opened, priced from 8 yuan to 7.8 yuan. Another 1,000 packages of red unpolished rice were priced from 7.05 cents to 0.02 cents. The Fuzhou group also purchased 400 packages of Kunshan Silver Bar Tip Grain Wrap New, priced at 7.5 yuan, which was the first time they had tried to handle it.</p>
<h3>Afternoon Decline in Flour Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month generally remained stable. With the price of foreign wheat rising by another 4, 5, and 6 cents, people in the industry were slightly more confident. Near-term was good by 0.5 cents, and far-term was good by 1 cent. However, because credit was tight everywhere, the purchasing power inside and outside the industry was not able to expand, so although the situation was good, transactions were still not smooth. When the afternoon session opened, prices for each month declined again. Major factories believe that the high prices in the international silver market have been proven by the facts. Our country is still an international dumping market, and it is temporarily unavoidable. For example, the asking price for Argentine wheat yesterday was only 4.57-4.58 yuan. It is heard that factories have already made transactions secretly, so the unloading of goods has become more active, and the market has been driven down. However, because the weather has been bad in recent days, some people are still unwilling to let go. As a result, this month was down 0.75 cents from the previous day. May, June, and July remained unchanged. August was down 0.25 cents. September remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Show Slight Improvement in the Aftermarket</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures opened in the morning and afternoon, they generally remained stable. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat rose by another 5 to 6 cents, there was actually no real need for it. Speculators were limited by the environment, so transactions were still sluggish. This month's price fell slightly to 4.31 yuan due to delivery reasons. There was not much change in the distant futures. In the afternoon, due to a slight purchase from outside the industry, and because of the weather, the domestic wheat harvest this year may be affected, so people felt slightly better. As a result, this month was better by 1 cent, August was better by 1 cent, and there were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Green Bean Cakes are Selling Well in the Mainland</h3>
<p>The cake market has not been easy to be active due to continuous rain, and sales are not smooth. Retail sales are moving. The sales of green bean cakes from the mainland have been the most active recently, because they are good in both appearance and color, and the marked price is cheaper than the three brands of factory cakes. Yesterday, 4,000 pieces were sold to the mainland group, priced at 1.58 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Follow the Sharp Decline in Gold, Again</h3>
<p>Dutch Red Drops More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw panic as gold prices once dropped to 900 yuan, and the market became even more sluggish. Although the Public Association of No. 24 Granulated White Sugar called for a price reduction of 20.03 yuan, there were still no transactions. Changxing Bank opened a shipment of 1,318 packages of Dutch Red, priced at 4.075 Dutch Guilders (foreign tax plus the customs gold and Dutch exchange rate calculated today amounts to 15.6 yuan, which is more than one yuan lower compared to yesterday's market). The remaining goods were all quiet and lacked market.</p>
<h3>Hardware 200-Pound Tinplate in Short Supply</h3>
<p>200-pound genuine American tinplate has been in extremely short supply recently, with very few arrivals. The demand exceeds the supply. Standard Flying Yellow Tengda can be opened up to 50 yuan per box, which is 13 to 14 yuan more than the same period last year. The market may have to rise again in the future.</p>

<h3>Talents of the Grand View Garden</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>In earlier years, the finale act of the Grand View Garden was Granny Liu scolding the gatekeepers. That required an elderly female role to come on stage and rant (放) a torrent of abuse, only stopping after putting on her pants backward. Back then, shouting (Kill, kill, kill!) while pointing at unarmed or already disarmed people was considered a truly majestic cry. So, this male actor playing an old woman could be considered a talent.</p>
<p>But times have changed greatly. Now, you hold a knife in your hand, but need to shout (Freedom, freedom, freedom!) and (Openness, etc.). The finale act needs to change.</p>
<p>And so, talents emerge in great numbers, each with their unique skills. Coming on stage is no longer the elderly female role, but a young female role, and not just any young female role, but what the Shanghai opera advertisements call a (Jesting Female Role). This is a special kind of character. She must know how to smile charmingly and how to throw a tantrum, how to flirt and tease, and how to be glib and slick. In short, this is a young female role combined with the role of a clown. Is it the times that create heroes (or, to be proper, (beauties)), or is it the result of a beauty's years of experience?</p>
<p>When a beauty is said to have (many years), it naturally means a seasoned woman who has seen many men. She has already risen from a prostitute to a madam. But she still retains her charm. Although she is selling people, she also sells herself. Selling herself is easy, but selling others is more difficult. Now, there are not only unarmed people, but also… and encountering blatant rape. To cope with such an extraordinary change, one must have extraordinary talent. Think about it: the current finale act must be both war-like and peace-like, war and peace at the same time, neither surrendering nor defending, both surrendering and defending. This is a very difficult act to perform. It cannot be done without the art of half-pushing, half-yielding, and feigning shyness. Mencius said, (Giving the world to others is easy). In fact, it is not difficult to simply offer (the world) to (others) with both hands. The problem is that it cannot be done that way. So, one must cry buckets of tears, complaining in a shrill voice: If I don't jump into the fire pit, who will?</p>
<p>However, when a prostitute says she has fallen into a fire pit, she still wants people to rescue her. But when a madam cries about the fire pit, few people will believe her, especially since she has already declared that she is opening her arms, ready to drag everyone into the fire pit. Nevertheless, this fresh finale act is not bad at all. It's not a very special talent, that even emptying one's mind one could come up with this idea.</p>
<p>The elderly female role enters, the jesting female role comes out. There are indeed many talents in the Grand View Garden!</p>
<h3>The Three Obsessions of Literary Men</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Pu Songling wrote (Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio), a massive work of over five or six hundred thousand words, all about strange and bizarre stories of ghosts and foxes. The book has been circulating for over a century, and is read by women and children alike, making it one of the most popular books in Chinese literature. Since I was a child, I have often read this book, but I always felt strange: why would a literary man come up with so many strange and eccentric events? I concluded that the author was obsessed, but I could not understand exactly what kind of obsession he was under. Recently, I reread (Strange Tales) and, by chance, I finally understood. His obsession was not simple, but can be divided into three kinds: first, lust; second, greed for wealth; and third, a combined obsession with officialdom and immortality. It was because of these three obsessions that he wrote this book of five or six hundred thousand words. In his book, these spirits are expressed very clearly. And these obsessions are not only possessed by literary men like Pu Liuxian, but by most people in China, which is why this book has been popular for so long and so widely. If the psychology of the Chinese people is not completely transformed, this book will be even more popular for longer and wider. Western critics explain that the reason why people, whether male, female, old or young, like to read strange stories is because they contain (the beauty of wonder). This may not be without reason, but what seduces people in (Strange Tales) is not this beauty of wonder, but the satisfaction of these (three obsessions).</p>
<p>First, lust: A refined and elegant scholar, handsome and talented (this must be the author), sits alone in his study, feeling bored, extremely bored. Then he drifts into a dream. As soon as he enters the dream, a maiden comes to him, and he gazes at her (with a dignified and beautiful appearance, like a fairy), or (with the fragrance of orchids and musk, uniquely beautiful), or (her hair is low and misty, her waist is slender and surprising; jade pistils and jade flowers are not enough to describe her). Next comes (they enter the bedroom together, loving each other deeply), or (leaking wetness, staining the bed). And so, a moment of spring is never forgotten for decades, or he goes to the underworld, digs up a coffin, or waits for rebirth, reliving old love and reuniting the broken mirror, achieving his goal and then stopping. If this is not lust, what is it? I suspect that Mr. Pu must not have had a happy marriage. His own wife was like a (demon), and he could not get satisfaction in real life, so he sought heavenly fairies in his fantasies.</p>
<p>Second, greed for wealth. Now that he has obtained a fairy-like lover, the next obsession is to have abundant food and clothing, and to command servants. His lover is either a fox, a ghost, or a fairy, all-powerful. If they want something, they get it. So, what is so difficult about money? For example, if he marries the Dragon King's daughter, everything will not be a problem. Emerald jewels are everywhere. If his lover is a fox or a ghost, as long as (they are in harmony, then gold and silk will always fill the boxes), and the most comfortable thing is that he (does not even know where it comes from). If this is not greed for wealth, what is it? Mr. Pu was probably a poor scholar. His life was probably not very easy. Even drinking wine may have required pawning something. So, he developed a greed for wealth.</p>
<p>Third, obsession with officialdom and immortality. Now that he has a beautiful wife and lives without worry, the next obsession is power. In Mr. Pu's time, the most powerful thing was to be an official, which could not only let one vent one's anger, but also judge all the injustices in the world. But I suspect that Mr. Pu was a scholar who was unsuccessful in his career. He probably never even became a minor magistrate with the title of seven rank. So, he made a (Yellow Millet Dream). Overnight, he became a cabinet minister and prime minister, above all the people and below the emperor. The world says that (Yellow Millet Dream) is a satire on poor scholars, but I don't think so. It is his harsh criticism of himself. He must have really had this dream, but it was not easy to say it directly. So, he had to find a scapegoat to take the blame for him. After repeatedly reading it, one can realize that the work is not a real satire, but is entirely written out of jealousy. But the Yellow Millet Dream ultimately cannot satisfy him, but instead makes him sigh a few more times. This makes people even more upset and angry. So, he scolds the vulgar people for being blinded by greed, and comes up with an eternal method to become an immortal, looking down at all the ignorant creatures in the sky. How happy that is. And so, (he died at the age of eighty-one. When the funeral was held, people were surprised that the coffin was light. When they opened it, it was an empty coffin). Living to eighty-one years old in the human world was not enough. In the end, he still became an immortal! If this is not an obsession with officialdom and immortality, what is it? Mr. Pu's pen name is Liuxian, which probably means that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from my point of view, this book of five or six hundred thousand words (Strange Tales) was written because the author suffered from these (three obsessions), and readers are probably mostly because they are suffering from these (three obsessions), which is why they like to read it so much.</p>
<p>Conclusion: These (three obsessions) are not only the obsessions of literary men, but the obsessions of our Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from My Hometown (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>First, I went to the caretaker's house and told him to lead the way because the grave was halfway up the mountain. I wore the caretaker's large straw hat and walked in front. The road gradually sloped upwards, and towering ancient pine trees stood tall on the roadside, with branches only at the top of the trees. The tree trunks below were five arm spans thick and stood straight. A little further on, there was a row of small springs, and the large stones at the bottom of the springs were stacked together, lying there so cleverly. It was impossible to see where the water came from and where it went, only a small stone pool with water more crystal clear than water filtered by sand. The water flowed quickly, as if flowing into the stones. A little further up from the pool, there was a steep cliff, and a waterfall hung down from the cliff, like a bolt of cloth with white flowers blooming on it. Small water droplets sprayed into the air, hanging there and never falling. I was so happy that I jumped up and down, ran to the pool, lay on the ground, and stretched my mouth to the surface of the water, drinking greedily. The crystal-clear water flowed past my eyes, and looking down from the transparent surface, I could see bubbles rising one by one, hitting the stones. Such a healthy mountain spring! If there were immortal nectar and jade elixir, this would be the immortal nectar of the Queen Mother of the West in legend, right?</p>
<p>Running a little further up the road, there were clumps of morning glories and camellias growing under the pine tree roots. The light red little flowers stretched their heads into the sunlight, smiling slightly with their mouths open. I picked many flowers, stuck one in my hat, and stuck one on my lapel, stretching my face into the sunlight and smiling slightly with my mouth open, just like those light red little flowers.</p>
<p>A stone cliff blocked the way. I turned a bend, walked along the stone steps to the top of the stone wall, and my grandfather's grave was there. The caretaker had already put down the basket and set out the wine and dishes. After bowing four times in front of the grave, I went alone from the pine forest to the top of the mountain. Towering all around were such tall pine trees, and for the first time I felt my own smallness. I climbed for a long time before I climbed out of the forest. There was still a long way to go to the top of the mountain, but the sea was already close at hand. Standing there, I shouted at the top of my lungs, and all I heard was echoes from the surrounding mountains. Below my eyes was such a small piece of land, with the fields all connected together, not even half a finger's width apart. The houses all looked like ant nests. (I am the king of the world!) Thinking like that, I laughed heartily.</p>
<p>By the time I rolled down the mountain and got on the boat, it was already two o'clock. When I passed the Baoguo Temple, the yellow ancient temple had already hidden its face in the thin dusk. I still lay on the bow of the boat, carrying a boatload of bright moonlight, singing songs as I went back, drunk as if because the moonlight is a very intoxicating wine.</p>
<p>The next day, I left those people seeing me off at the bridge and returned to Shanghai. When I saw the golden dome of the Sassoon Building again, I could still hear them saying:</p>
<p>(When will you come back?)</p>
<h3>Red Radish Whiskers</h3>
<p>— Written by J.N.L.ESRENA RD, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Nightmares  Red Radish Whiskers disliked the friends who visited his home. They disturbed him, occupied his bed, and forced him to sleep with his mother. However, besides his various faults during the day, he had a major fault at night: snoring. He snored deliberately, of that there was no doubt.</p>
<p>In that large house, cold even in August, stood two beds. One belonged to Gramps; Red Radish slept in the other, at the top, beside his mother.</p>
<p>Before falling asleep, he coughed in the blankets, clearing his throat. But perhaps it was snoring? He breathed softly, checking if his nostrils were blocked. He practiced not breathing too heavily.</p>
<p>But as soon as he fell asleep, he snored. It was almost a habit.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Gramps's wife would dig her two fingernails into the fattest part of his buttocks, drawing blood. She had carefully chosen this method.</p>
<p>Red Radish Whiskers' scream suddenly woke Gramps up, who asked: "What's wrong?" "He's having a nightmare," said Gramps's wife. Then, like a nanny lulling a child, she softly sang a lullaby that sounded like an Indian one. With her forehead and knees pressed against the wall, as if trying to knock it down; her hands covering her buttocks, hiding the claw marks that came with the first snore, Red Radish Whiskers fell back into a deep sleep on that large bed, at the top, beside his mother.</p>
<p>Is this the kind of thing we can imagine? Is this the kind of thing we can even tell people? Other children, at this age, with hearts and bodies just as pure white, are already holding communion, while Red Radish Whiskers remains a dirty child. One night, he waited too long; he didn't dare say anything. He hoped that by wriggling in bed, the discomfort would pass. How difficult! Another night, he dreamed that he was conveniently positioned next to a boundary marker, and then he naturally, soundly relieved himself in bed. He woke up. He was surprised that there was no boundary marker beside him! Gramps's wife restrained herself. She quietly, generously, like a mother, cleaned everything up. And, the next morning, Red Radish Whiskers even ate breakfast before getting out of bed, like a spoiled child. Yes, someone brought him a bowl of broth to his bed, a carefully prepared bowl of broth, and Gramps's wife secretly added a little something into the soup with a small wooden ladle. Ah! Just a little. The older brother, Felix, and the older sister, Elestine, stared at Red Radish Whiskers at the head of the bed with a sinister look, as if they were about to laugh. Gramps's wife fed her child spoonful by spoonful with a small spoon. She winked at the older brother, Felix, and the older sister, Elestine, as if saying: "Watch out! Get ready!" "Yes, Mom." (They were already anticipating his funny face when he found out. They should have invited some neighbors to join in the fun.) Finally, Gramps's wife cast a final glance at her two older children, as if asking them: "Are you ready?" Slowly, slowly, she lifted the last spoonful to Red Radish Whiskers' wide-open mouth, feeding it straight to his throat, filling him up, stuffing him, and then said to him with a mocking and disgusted look: "Ah! You dirty thing, you've eaten it, you've eaten it, you've eaten what you peed out yourself, what you peed out the night before last." "I guessed it already," Red Radish Whiskers replied indifferently, without making the funny face they had hoped to see. He was already used to it, and if we are used to something, we no longer find it strange.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>It's Your Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>I often hear people shouting (Self-sacrifice), and I often think that it is indeed a pleasant, beautiful, and fashionable phrase, so sometimes I half-consciously, actually unconsciously, learn to shout it too. The reason is very simple: I am a youth, I also love beauty, and I love fashion even more.</p>
<p>Last night, while discussing a certain issue with Gang, I again used this beautiful and pleasant term as a powerful reason, so I repeatedly shouted (I sacrifice myself) (Self-sacrifice). I even explained: (If you don’t sacrifice the small self, there will be no big self). Gang said, (It's your sacrifice) (It's your sacrifice) you are happy, you go and sacrifice yourself then. In fact, isn't it the silly children who take (you) to sacrifice that makes all of reality so lively? Naturally, the patterns would not become more novel or more fluent. ... After hearing these words, I had some understanding; I thought: Yes, (It's your sacrifice) is more reasonable and meaningful than (Self-sacrifice), and of course it is more beautiful and fashionable, and the sound of (It's your sacrifice) is also louder and more pleasant than (Self-sacrifice).</p>
<p>What is (It's your sacrifice)? For example, you Chinese, if you don't sacrifice a lot, how can I, Japan, occupy your Northeast? With your little people sacrificing, my young marshal will be able to afford Ford airplanes with three engines, and there will be so many gold bars for the Japanese to rob, and even if the old base is lost, there is still overseas to go; with this group after group, batch after batch of you sacrificing for me and being driven by me, then this seat should belong to me, and this power should be made by me; if you smoke opium, if you set up gambling houses, if you sell your flesh, then the virtuous and honest me can use it as a resource to make a living; other things such as, only when you die can I live, etc., are the true meaning of (It's your sacrifice), and these facts are so worthy of praise and admiration! Silly children, you may continue to insist on your (It's your) spirit and promote it, the facts will bring you more excitement and the patterns will definitely be more novel.</p>

<h3>Poor Illness Diary</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Only unity is enough for survival These past two weeks, being poor has been a real problem. But being poor is not just as simple as being hungry, because being hungry is just being hungry, and you can still move around. Sometimes, just by moving around, you might be able to temporarily fill your stomach. However, the affairs of the poor are never that simple; in reality, they play out in ways that make people scratch their heads. Isn’t the illness in these two weeks too peculiar and unpredictable? Yes, this is inevitable. From now on, I absolutely believe that (poverty) and (illness) are linked and never separate.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Ying came to visit me as usual. I am really grateful and happy because, as a lonely, poor, and sick traveler in a foreign land, I actually have an old friend to come and talk to. Isn’t this joyful enough? Discovered That today, my spirits are much better. She said that Tarzan the Ape Man is a beautiful film that pleases people and broadens their horizons. She suggested that I accompany her to buy two hours of happiness. I agreed to her, so we stepped onto the stairs of the Paia Theater. The plot of this film is very simple, but the picture depicts the greatness and beauty of nature, as if taking us on a two-hour tour of Africa!</p>
<p>At the dinner table, Ying and I talked about (Tarzan the Ape Man) again; Ying asked me, (What lessons did (Tarzan the Ape Man) give people?) I said (So many people spend all day just working on money, with their minds full of (How to get rich?) (How to get rich?) Their whole lives are buried in the eyes of copper coins! This is truly the most ridiculous and most pitiful group in the world! Look, wasn’t (Burke) full of (collecting ivory) (getting rich)? In the end, he died buried in (ivory). In fact, what could he really possess?</p>
<p>·········)</p>
<p>(Your views are really good;) she said spiritedly, (But there is one point you shouldn’t lightly overlook, which is that, in this robber world, this beastly world where there is only might and no justice, if the weak do not unite with each other, foreign insults will definitely come layer upon layer and eventually be eaten by the strong! Because of this, although (apes) and (elephants) are the weaker ones among the beasts, because they can firmly unite and work together, as a result, although the (Japanese) are fierce, they are unorganized, and eventually the (Japanese nest) is trampled flat by the elephants! In fact, our country is already extremely weak, and within the country, opinions are divided and people are killing each other, insisting on creating personal supremacy. What about the loss of the Northeast and the crisis in Pingjin? This is just a small firecracker, not enough to deafen or enlighten! Therefore, foreign insults listen to it. National demise also listens to it, fortunately, the country belongs to everyone, as long as it doesn’t hurt (my) skin. The country is like this, so there is no need to mention the premier’s words (uniting the weak nations of the world)!… But, without unity, can we survive?…</p>
<p>I smiled and poured her a cup of tea. I said, "Speak slowly, don't choke yourself."</p>

<h3>The Immortality of Matter</h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>I don’t know who invented materialism, but our patriotic profiteers were the first to use it, no, I’m afraid it was still the non-resistance advocates who enjoyed it first. The national crisis after September 18th is becoming increasingly serious, which no one denies. However, the national crisis is still a national crisis. If the land is occupied by others, it just becomes (mine is yours, yours is mine), so what does it matter? Moreover, according to the scientific definition of matter, (matter is something that exists in space, has shape, and can be recognized and felt by people) isn’t land a thing? All things are matter, and no one will deny that the so-called (immortality of matter) is wrong. Therefore, our Young Marshal Zhang, in accordance with materialism, lost the Eastern Provinces. Although the land was occupied by others, in terms of procedure, it was just a change of management, but matter is ultimately immortal, so what’s the big deal? He held this principle, so the loss of Jinzhou, the fall of Yuguan, and the abandonment of Rehe were all predetermined ideas. I’m afraid that our common people’s scolding is due to not understanding the immortality of matter. Telegram reports how the enemy forces are and how our forces are, explaining in detail, so you can rest assured and live that cowardly life. It’s a pity that our common people still don’t understand his intentions, and they scold with righteous indignation.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that our common people don’t understand the immortality of matter. Even the dignified Central Committee member Mr. Zhang Ji and the Minister of the Navy are investigating Young Marshal Zhang’s ancient paintings and the sale of the Tianjin Naval Hospital, using the government’s name to pursue the case by law. Unfortunately, they still don’t know the theorem of the immortality of matter, and Young Marshal Zhang is probably secretly laughing at them.</p>
<p>Although the ancient paintings of the Summer Palace were handled by Young Marshal Zhang and not handed over to the government, but taken away privately, regardless of whether they were sold to foreigners or not, ancient paintings are still ancient paintings, it’s just that they are stored abroad. So why investigate? The sale of the naval hospital is also the same principle. Young Marshal Zhang, who understands the immortality of matter, would not make any mistakes in the procedure. The government is really meddlesome.</p>
<p>However, the profiteers understand this principle and send large sums of money overseas. The foolish anti-treason group uses bombs and threats, but they will not make the profiteers feel alarmed, because the outflow of money does not necessarily mean that the enemies will swallow it; it is still circulating, turning into silver, gold, or copper, but the original substance is still there! (The immortality of matter,) is also the same principle, who says it isn’t! Ah, ah, foolish countrymen, smart profiteers, and Young Marshal Zhang, are all eternally famous.</p>
<h3>Woolen Sweater</h3>
<p>— Flood</p>
<p>After the graduation certificates were obtained, the faces of the students were all filled with victorious smiles.</p>
<p>Now that he had graduated from middle school, they were the children of the propertied class, so naturally they would continue to enter university. As long as there is money, this threshold of university is naturally very easy to cross. He entered university not only for academic pursuits, but also with the added bonus of the love issue, which seemed more important than studying. It is known that the C University he entered was affected by the war, so the female students were really as rare as stars in the morning sky, under the gazes of the male students. There is indeed an overabundance of male students compared to female. This place is a short ten-minute train ride from S City.</p>
<p>(She is truly a modern woman of the times, her healthy physique shows youth and loveliness everywhere!) He repeatedly recited the above two sentences, and his body couldn't help but press closer to her.</p>
<p>(Is she really flirting with me? Putting down that pair of beige gloves, she then took out a compact powder case to powder her face and put on bright lipstick.) He asked himself secretly again. However, reciting was still reciting, the train was about to reach its destination, and there was ultimately no chance to chat with her.</p>
<p>(Hey! Miss, you forgot your gloves.) As everyone was crowding out of the carriage, he held the gloves she had forgotten; of course, he would not let this excellent opportunity slip away easily, and he rushed forward as if flying and shouted.</p>
<p>(Thank you. Thank you!) She nodded and smiled shyly.</p>
<p>(You're welcome.) Seeing her show the shy expression of a young girl, this naturally encouraged him even more to muster all his spirit and courage to attack her: (Miss, you are probably studying at R School, right? I remember seeing you at a certain art exhibition, but I haven't had the pleasure of knowing your surname? My name is Liu Xingbang, and I am also at C University, which is right next to your school.)</p>
<p>(Hmm.)</p>
<p>(I have a small matter I would like to trouble you with. My younger sister wishes to study at your school, is there any way?)</p>

<p>(Money? I have it.) (The manuscript must be delivered on time tomorrow. Hehe, otherwise your woolen sweater, please don't think about putting it on right away.)</p>
<p>Store Clerk Communication</p>
<h3>Doctor's Wife</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I was originally a store clerk, and I lost my job after (September 18th). Now I勉强 make do as a tutor. My wife is a woman who has never been to school, she is very loyal to me, and I love her very much. Last year, she saw that I had lost my job and my income had decreased, so to save money, she left me and returned to her hometown. She has a very close female friend who is an experienced elementary school teacher. Because her situation is very difficult, my wife used to ask me to write letters to comfort her. Therefore, the three of us became friends.</p>
<p>The situation of my wife's female friend is like this: She married a student from Tongji University when she had not yet graduated from normal school. The love at that time was also very good, but they separated after living together for only a month or two. After the European War, her husband went to Germany to study. At that time, because he had financial difficulties, she and her father repeatedly ran around to appeal and raise money to support him. The salary she received was even more湊入汇去. The matter is really strange, after he graduated from university, he gave her fewer and fewer letters, and the words in the letters often had a kind of disgusted expression. Writing letters to urge him to return home, he said he still needed to study. After he got his doctorate, she urged him again, but he still made excuses to postpone it. She suspected at that time that he had married a German woman abroad; her father had also written to the ambassador to Germany, asking him to urge him to return home. The reply only said that the reason he had not returned home was probably because he did not have travel expenses. Once, she wrote a letter to question him and asked to separate, but he ignored her. Since then, there has been even less correspondence. Asking people to inquire about news, but there was no result; only one or two letters were sent home a year. His mother, who is over sixty years old, is looking forward to it and has repeatedly sent letters urging him, but to no avail. This has dragged on for almost twenty years. She has neither formally divorced him, nor has she met a new lover, and her life is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Last year, my wife returned to her hometown, and old friends reunited, comforting each other, and their feelings became more intense. My wife often asked her to write letters to me on her behalf. Therefore, she got to see the secrets between the two of us: she was very envious! I have repeatedly told her to officially divorce and meet a new lover. Her replies always said that divorce was not a problem at all, but the power of the old ethics was still very strong, opposing divorce and despising remarriage. Except for you, there is no one else among relatives and friends to help me. I have no hope for this life. This is so painful! I originally wanted to find her a lover among relatives and friends, but after paying attention for several years, I have not found a suitable person. In this situation, I have no choice but to write a letter to comfort her, saying: (I am willing to love you as much as I love my wife, and we can live together when we have the opportunity). Usually, we still do our own jobs as usual, our finances are independent of each other, and we help each other; we will be pioneers of a new type of male and female union to moisten her withering soul.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, you are a guide for people. Is it okay to do this? Please give me your honest instructions.</p>
<p>Wishing you good health, sincerely, Zhang Zhicheng</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The reason why this doctor who studied in Germany did not return home, although according to the reply from the German embassy, it was said to be because he did not have travel expenses. But from the way he treated his wife coldly, it is probably as his wife expected, nineteen times out of ten he already has a new love. Otherwise, the tuition fees in the past were still arranged by his wife and others; why is he embarrassed to ask for the last travel expenses now? Although he is said to be a dignified doctor, his personality is completely gone; we cannot help but scold him here as an (ungrateful) thing, and we advocate giving him appropriate punishment. This doctor's wife should apply to the court for a divorce and reserve the right to demand compensation for damages and alimony from him after the doctor returns home in the future. Unless he is willing to be a ghost in a foreign land, otherwise he must be held accountable.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, because he is motivated by righteous indignation, decides to moisten the doctor's wife's about-to-withered soul, which is a righteous act; however, you say that you are willing to love her as much as you love your wife, and you and you have the opportunity to live together, what do these two sentences really mean? If your union is just to help each other, then you must first discuss it with his husband's family, otherwise you may have the crime of (interfering with the family). In case your union is not only this, but also hopes to further have the name of husband and wife. Then, on his side, the divorce procedures must be completed; on your side, you must also discuss it with your wife. Otherwise, the (bigamy) crime is established.</p>

<h3>Fleeting Time in Dreams (Continued Thirty-Seventh)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>There was originally an organization in Nanjing calling itself the National University Professors' Association for Anti-Japanese Salvation. Wu Yi was also one of the standing committee members. However, before the Wang Guodong incident, he did not often consult on the association's affairs, at most signing his name on declarations and circulars. Therefore, he really knew nothing about the organization and achievements of this salvation association.</p>
<p>(It's quite a large courtyard!) Since Wu Yi was determined to do some solid salvation work, he certainly couldn't just sit at home. His first step was to visit the National University Professors' Association for National Salvation, hoping to do some practical work within the limits of an executive committee member. The association's location was No. 18 ○○ Volume. According to Wu Yi's prediction, it would be a couple of small rooms rented from someone else, just for meetings and discussions. Little did he know that when he arrived at the place, it was the complete opposite of what he expected. No. 18 turned out to be a newly built small Western-style house. A large blue banner with white characters hung prominently on the door. Besides that, there were no other signs. Undoubtedly, this was a place exclusively occupied by an organization!</p>
<p>Stepping inside, it was even more extraordinary. The paint was brand new, and the decoration was luxurious. If it weren't for the sign outside, Wu Yi would have almost suspected it was a golden house for important people to hide their mistresses. The house, it was said, had a reception area, a reception room, a meeting hall, staff offices, a committee member lounge, a secretary's office, a standing committee member's office, a dining hall, and so on. It had everything! Even combining the ○ big administrative office and the teaching affairs office, it still wouldn't be as complete and spacious as this place!</p>
<p>(You go ahead! I don't have anything to do. I'll just look around for a while and then leave!) Because Wu Yi had already registered at the reception room when he entered, the seven or eight errand runners wearing white bamboo cloth uniforms with numbered copper plates on their chests all knew that a committee member had arrived. They stood up neatly together, only stopping short of bowing and greeting him. At the same time, one errand runner with a number one copper plate led the way respectfully, leading him inside. However, Wu Yi was naturally humble and couldn't get used to such official flattery. He waved him away hastily after passing the meeting hall.</p>
<p>Crossing the committee member lounge, he arrived in front of the staff offices. There were two offices, one smaller one, with four exquisitely crafted desks and four large swivel chairs with backrests. The other furnishings were also more elaborate than Wu Yi's principal's office. At the moment, it was as quiet as if no one were inside. Wu Yi tiptoed over for a look and saw an old gentleman, about his own age, hunched over a desk, diligently studying Brother Xing Yuren's (Painting Bedchamber Studies). There was also an errand runner snoring like thunder in the corner accompanying him.</p>
<p>Seeing that both of them were sound asleep, Wu Yi didn't want to stay longer, so as not to disturb their pleasant time. He quietly retreated. (Three! Three! Three! Damn it! Another three...)</p>
<p>(Okay! This time it's a sure six, three, six, eighteen corners, plus four corners, together two dollars and one [Is there a foreign coin? Find it!]) He had only just reached the front of the other, larger office. A chaotic... the clinking sound of silver coins and small change crashing together pierced Wu Yi's ears, immediately arousing his curiosity. He couldn't help but take a few quick steps and step into this mysterious office.</p>

<h3>The Progress of the Soviet Comedy Film Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhu Dalin</p>
<p>Thirty-Two-Year-Old Young Director</p>
<p>Eisenstein Presides Over It</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a socialist country adept at creation. Anything that benefits the people's health and spirit is vigorously promoted and encouraged. A few months ago, we heard that the country encouraged writers to engage in playwriting and turn them into motion pictures to regulate the spiritual lives of the working masses, and recently it has been steadily progressing. Isn't that admirable?</p>
<p>This news not only opens a new chapter in the modern film industry, but also during this time when countries around the world are declining, the sudden appearance of such a good phenomenon is really something worthy of our attention. Sergei Eisenstein, who is in charge of comedy films, is still a 32-year-old youth. He is regarded as one of the four major directors of the film movement in the Soviet Union. It is said that he does not want to hang up an empty sign, but to engage in the creation of real life. He believes that individualistic male and female actors cannot meet the requirements of the new society, so he wants to work hard for the masses. His first successful work was the play "Strike," which appeared in 1924. In this film, he used the emotions of the masses to train actors and achieve extra success. Other films he starred in include "Potemkin," "October," and "Ten Days That Shook the World."</p>
<p>Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks visited Paris in 1927 and were deeply moved after seeing his "Potemkin." When they arrived in Moscow, they went to visit him immediately.</p>
<p>Eisenstein once went to Hollywood, but he returned to Moscow soon after because he was dissatisfied. At that time, he was not only the most active person in the film industry, but also had profound research on the theory and practice of film. In addition to serving as a professor at the Moscow National Film Institute, he also worked as the director of the Psychological and Health Laboratory for Studying Mass Response.</p>
<p>He is now making comedy films, using the most exquisite and ingenious devices to achieve satisfactory results. Harpo Marx, one of the four great comedians, recently went to Moscow to collaborate with him.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Film Conference</h3>
<p>— Zong</p>
<p>The Entire Film Industry Produces Twelve Short Films</p>
<p>To Fund the (Film Number) Aircraft</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for Fundraising for the (Film Number) Aircraft through Joint Film Production in the Film Industry held a script discussion meeting the day before yesterday at the Tsinghua Alumni Association on the fourth floor of the Continental Commercial Building. Attendees that day included: Municipal Government Representatives Zhu Shaoping and Shen Gao, Lianbiao Representatives Jin Yu, Bu Wancang, and Cai Chusheng, Star Representatives Zheng Zhengqiu, Hehe Representatives Wang Pengyi and Gu Wenzong, Tianyi Representatives Gao Tianqi, Hengsheng Representatives Zheng Yingshi, Jinan Representatives Yang Tianle and Xie Yuesheng, Yueming Representative Zhao Zhenbao, Dadong Representatives Gong Lusun, Xifan Representatives Ren Xifan. Around nine o'clock, they were invited to be seated for a meal by Zhu and Shen. The discussion of scripts from various companies began at ten o'clock. First, Zheng Zhengqiu spoke about the national salvation plot of students and actors. Then, Bu Wancang narrated a children's national salvation story. Next, Cai Chusheng spoke about the workers' national salvation guidelines. Then, Lusun narrated the political circles' national salvation strategies. Yang Tianle described the military personnel's national salvation preparations. Mr. Xie Yuesheng's beggars' national salvation mobilization. Zhao Zhenbao talked about the spirit that farmers should have for national salvation. Gu Wenzong narrated the final struggle of artists for national salvation. Gao Tianqi did not bring a script, but said some methods for the business community to save the country, and suggested making a story about a dancer saving the country. Ren Xifan, because he was not good at screenwriting, was willing to help with a thousand feet of newsreel of the Rehe war. Zheng Yingshi, because there were no basic actors, volunteered to shoot the opening and ending credits.</p>
<p>The entire project is divided into twelve plots. After the attendees modified the unreasonable parts of each plot, they discussed how to link these eleven stories together. As a result, it became more difficult, so it was finally decided to perform each story in a narrative style, with the ending summarizing the goal of this aviation national salvation campaign. At twelve o'clock, Shen Gao instructed each representative to submit their story to Mayor Wu within three days, and also asked each representative and screenwriter to think of a better way to connect the plots, and also to think of a general title for the entire film, so as to determine the overall name of the film. Mr. Shen said: (It would be best if it can be successful before the end of May.)</p>
<p>Finally: After all the discussions were completed, the preparatory committee was changed to the executive committee, and all company representatives automatically became executive members and started the overall work from May 1st.</p>
<p>Then, this national salvation film, which is made by the joint efforts of the entire film industry's directors, actors, set designers, photographers, and various personnel, will surely be able to call on the audience and have the power to influence the audience to save the country.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Criticisms from a Family of Six Regarding "The Morning of the Metropolis"</h3>
<p>— Tang Hanguang</p>
<p>When "The Morning of the Metropolis" was screened at Guanghua a few days ago, our whole family (father, mother, older brother, sister-in-law, two older sisters and me, seven people in total) went to see it. Afterwards, at the dinner table, everyone expressed some comments about this film. In addition to some praise, below are some different opinions: Father, with the attitude of a family elder, expressed that it was too much for Xu Qiling not to accept the gifts and inheritance from his real father (Huang Menghua). Moreover, it is not the behavior of a good man to have this old man angered to death. Therefore, this point is quite doubtful.</p>
<p>Mother's opinion was that the name of Menghua's lover was not mentioned at all in the explanation, which was a loophole. The elder brother's opinion was that Qiling was innocently arrested and sent to prison, but the editor defended the court, saying that his grievances were cleared because the court conducted a thorough investigation. This clearly shows that the screenwriter is satisfied with the current court system, or he does not have the courage to attack it. In addition, Qiling told his sister in prison that (I must take revenge), but in the end, Qiling only hit Huiling a few times. This revenge is too light. The two older sisters felt that it was unreasonable for Huiling, a playboy, to wholeheartedly love the female worker Wang Renmei; it was also unreasonable for parents not to punish their son for being unruly at home; and it was also unreasonable for Menghua to find out that his son was unfilial and that Xiao Zhang was helping the abuser, so he called the servants to lock them up. It was also unreasonable that Xu Qiling came out of prison to save his sister, but his sister did not ask: (Brother, when did you get out of prison?) This is also unreasonable.</p>
<p>As for me and my sister-in-law, we both thought this film was very good, but it was a pity that Qiling rejected Menghua's inheritance. So I said: If I were Qiling, I would definitely accept this property. Why should I leave this money to Huiling to do evil?</p>
<h3>"Going to Shanghai" Completely Filmed, Produced by Sanyi Company</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuanshi</p>
<p>The Rongji Sanyi Film Company, organized by Zhang Ye'er, Wang Wu Neng, and Huang Jinrong, borrowed the Lianhua studio to film "Going to Shanghai." It has been two months since then, and it was completely filmed the day before yesterday. It is also said that it will be screened at the Central Grand Theater in the near future. This film is all about persuading people to learn to read and the suffering of illiteracy, etc.</p>
<h3>Cecil B. DeMille's Eyes Are Sharp</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Although the great director Cecil B. DeMille is old, his eyes are still sharp. None of the actors he has chosen have failed to make a name for themselves. Last year, Paramount launched a beauty pageant, and four beauties were selected as a result. Cecil B. DeMille invited these four beauties to dinner. At the dinner table, he said, (You four were selected from four thousand people. I predict that your future will be very bright. Just wait and see.)</p>
<p>Six months later, Cecil B. DeMille invited them to dinner again. As expected, his prediction came true, and each of them had a long-term contract and a good start. Kathleen Burke played a key role in "Island of Lost Souls" and "Murders in the Zoo". Gail Patrick also worked in the same film. Lona Andre played the leader in "The Mysterious Rider". Verna Hillie appeared in "From Hell to Heaven" and played a key female role in "Under the Tonto Rim".</p>
<h3>Ann Harding Is Afraid of Seeing Old Men</h3>
<p>— Hua Ming</p>
<p>Ann Harding of RKO, her husband Harry Bannister, is an old man of ninety. After Ann Harding married him, she was so annoyed by this old man that she was afraid of him, so except when she was filming at the company, there was no way to avoid Bannister. Everywhere else, she did not stay with him. Bannister was extremely angry and divorced her immediately. But afterwards, Bannister regretted it very much. Ann Harding was afraid that he would pester her again, so she asked RKO for leave and did not know where to hide. Later, Bannister went to look for her everywhere. He actually found her. It turned out that Ann Harding had hidden in a theater thirty miles outside of Hollywood. She used to be an actress in this theater. Now she has returned to her old place, and the theater owner is very sincere in entertaining her and inviting her to perform a play. Unexpectedly, Bannister found this theater on this day and also came in as a guest. When Ann Harding saw him in the middle of the play, she immediately ran away from the backstage.</p>
<p>This piece is translated from the April issue of Motion Picture magazine. Although it is not (sensual) (scented), it is also talking about men and women. I am afraid that people like Mr. Tongzhen, who are moralistic, will cite it and cost them their minds, so I will explain it at the end of the article. Anyway, everything about women is (in what era is it now?) cannot be done. In the end, I hope that all women will die, then what era (?) will not be a problem. I wonder what Tongzhen thinks? (The author is responsible for the content)</p>
<p>(I don’t say anything. Anyway, with the four characters "The author is responsible for the content," the editor can just publish it without even looking at the manuscript and does not need to be responsible. Not smart.)</p>
<h3>Film Novel "Cavalcade" (8)</h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>Of course, the most miserable person to hear about the war was Keiin. She sighed and said, (In any case, Edward is spared this disaster. Fortunately, he died when he was happy. Otherwise, seeing the demise of this world, I don't know how much more heartbroken I would be?) When Robert heard this, he knew that she had suffered a lot and could not bear any more stimulation, so he quickly ran over to support her and said, (Why do you worry so much? We have experienced several wars before, but the world has not collapsed.) Keiin's eyes were filled with tears, and she said (The world I am talking about is my own world; my world is very small.) At this time, Keiin's attitude was different from before. She suddenly took a desperate gamble and said, (Okay! Long live England! May we always be victorious and indestructible! Joey, although you are a child, you are qualified to carry a gun and fight. Let's stake our life and death on this one throw!)</p>
<p>Everyone looked at her attitude and looked at each other in dismay, speechless. Keiin had made up her mind, and crazily cried and shouted, and went to another room.</p>
<p>In this way, their whole family joined the war. The first one was, of course, Robert, who led an army to the front line. Keiin and Margaret also joined the rear service, doing the work of rolling bandages, and they didn't know how many miles of gauze they rolled in a day. The last one was Joey, who also left Eton College and joined the army. He wore a yellow military uniform and looked like a heroic young military officer, but he also knew that danger was waiting for him in the future. So he had to seize the moment and live in the moment, so that he could put life and death out of his mind. One day, Joey and a partner went to a nightclub together. At that time, Fanni had become a red female performer, and her fame was overflowing in the mouths of Londoners. Joey didn't recognize her when he first saw her in that nightclub. He asked the people next to him who that heavenly being was, and they said that it was the extremely popular Fanni Brelgis. Joey was stunned when he heard this. He quickly looked at the playbill, and carefully recognized the face on the stage, and it was indeed Fanni Brelgis. He waited with joy until the play was over, and then ran to the backstage to see her. She didn't recognize Joey at first, and thought that this unfamiliar man had run into the actress's dressing room and wanted to drive him out. Later, after someone explained the origin, Fanni remembered her childhood friend. From then on, their love also began. Fanni gave up many princes, nobles, and wealthy merchants, and focused her love on Joey alone. Joey's good fortune is known. However, good times don't last long, and beautiful clouds are easy to dissipate. Heaven has already destined that Joey's good fortune is strong, and disaster will follow closely.
