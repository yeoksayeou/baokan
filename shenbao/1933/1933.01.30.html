<p>（東京）海相大角今日對報界釋明渠於一月二十三日在議會所發關於海軍程序之言論、謂第二海軍補充程序全部分之詳則、尙未决定、惟其中一部分即現請核准者、僅涉及建造潛艇給養艦一艘、及潛艇追逐艦兩艘、總計需費日金一千五百萬元、至於海軍飛機隊除倫敦會議後所定之程序外、無所增加、海相並切實否認日本曾在太平洋受託代管諸島建造潛艇根據地及飛機場之說、謂現僅在諸島興建船港、以供商用、海軍省與此項工作實無關係云、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c19">中國敎育學會成立穗 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>最近各地敎育界人士。鑒於我國敎育日瀕破産。應亟謀所以挽救之道。爰組織中國敎育學會以研究并改造敎育爲宗旨。並自前日｜｜一二八｜｜起。集各處代表。假座上海青年會舉行成立大會。同時分别研究關於各級敎育之重要問題如「目前中國之敎育方針。」「在今日中國大學敎育應負何種使命。」及「中國目前中等敎育亟應改進之點何在」等項。在一二八最爲沉痛之血的國難紀念日。成立此一最有意義之學會吾人認此學會之産生。實負有最偉大之使命。</p>
<p>邇年來内亂外侮。交相煎逼。國勢危殆。不可終朝。而舉國上下。。憂時者惟有惶急消極者惟有待死。而其他遷延苟安得過且過若燕巢飛幕而不知危者更觸目皆是。夫以土廣民衆而又具有五千年悠長歷史之民族。而迄於今日竟有亂不能制。有侮不能禦舉國惶惶。束手待斃。由此種現象而觀吾人即謂爲今日我國敎育已整個失敗。不爲過。</p>
<p>我國今日當前之兩大問題。一爲内亂。一爲外侮。内亂何自生。一言以蔽之爲由於大衆無飯吃。惟大衆飢餒不能安其生故亂。復惟内亂相循。故外侮乃得乘隙而入。吾人今日而欲安定我人民之生活。并抗禦外來之强暴。根本問題。固在於政治經濟之改善。然而改革敎育。使敎育適合於當前之需要。使敎育能切實完成其使命。要亦爲最重要之一端。</p>
<p>然則當前敎育之使命爲何吾人認爲第一應爲生産的。第二應爲向上的。</p>
<p>何以言之。過去之敎育。如不故爲文過飾。非則不能不承認其爲漫無目標。復茫無方針。青年一入學校即成爲一種特殊階級。生活日益奢靡。慾望日益提高。其生活之優裕。殆十倍甚至百倍於勞苦大衆。敎育旣不能解决其本身及其四週之一切問題。反拉青年出社會。使其日與社會相隔離。日與大衆相隔離。侈談主義。空方理論若爲美國化若爲歐洲化。而不顧及我國之實際情形。於是在學者旣毫無目的。而畢業以後。更一無所能一無所用。敎育旣不能與社會打成一片。旣不能導使青年走上生産與建設之坦途。而反爲社會造遊民。因之愈敎而國愈貧。社會秩序愈亂。敎育徒爲種惡因徒爲種痼疾。則今日之食此果。事非應然。故今後之敎育。吾人必確定其使命爲生産爲建設爲創造。應使每一青年都能發揮其聰明才力。能受充分之政治訓練。能與社會打成一片。能刻苦。能耐勞而又富有創造新時代新社會之精神此其一也。</p>
<p>所謂今後敎育之使命應爲「向上的」者又何。吾人認爲一民族之所以能生存於世界。厥爲有「民族自信力」惟有民族自信力。故能爭鬥。抗禦强暴。能維護其民族之生存我民族具有五千年悠遠之歷史。而迄於今日。竟頽萎不振。如肉陳爼上靜待宰割。是不能不謂爲我民族自信力。已銷磨殆盡。故今後之敎育。又應確定其使命。爲提高我民族之向上性。爲恢復我民族之自信力。使我民族能秉此自信力以爭取生存獨立之自由此其又一也。</p>
<p>總之時至今日。國脈民命。都不絶如縷。在此非常時期。即應厲行非常之敎育。一切設施今日都應重新估定其目的與意義。一切都應重新開頭。而敎育尤爲最重要之一端今中國敎育學會已成立矣。吾人切盼斯會能把握當前我民族之要求。以實踐之精神。負荷改進敎育重樹國基之重責。</p>

<p>路透社二十八日巴黎電　今晨閣員離總統府後、勒白倫總統獨留彭古在府、商榷三刻鐘之久、俾佈置核准一月三十一日用欵之表决案、因目前國庫已空也、聞此舉在憲法上可以辦到、縱新内閣於本月底未能成立、然參衆兩院亦可成就此必要手續也、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社二十八日日内瓦電　法國政潮有使軍縮會議問題、趨於複雜之危險、此間一般意見、均希望法國閣潮迅速解决、俾國際上重大問題、不致過於拖延、軍縮會議曾組織委員會、就各國國内範圍、研究私人製造軍械問題、此項委員會、原應於本日開會、由法國代表外次谷脫氏主席、現因法國内閣推翻、形勢一變、恐英國關於軍縮未來工作方法之提議、難望提出討論矣、軍縮會議、法國人士對此項提案印象甚好、德國人士則大爲失望、德國代表團以爲英國提案、不過欲於胡佛西門與法國三種提案、以及上年十二月軍縮會議决議案之間、謀一調解辦法而已、由軍備之質地上言之、德國堅求軍備平等原則、立即實行、而德國不能保有之軍械、其他各國亦應加以銷燬、至軍備之數量胡佛曾要求裁減三分之二、而德國則認爲應照該國對國聯盟約第八條之解釋、實行「相對」原則云、</p>

<h3 id="c95">中國共産黨的崩潰 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>｜朱宜之脫離共黨後之自述｜</p>
<p>據現方脫離共黨之朱宜之君述「中國共産黨的崩潰」情形甚詳、紀之如左、</p>
<p>一·我原來是共產黨的忠實信徒、我在共產黨内　　有七年的歷史、現在我站到反共的最前綫來、</p>
<p>我這一次政治上的轉變、是經過了一晝夜的思維、這一晝夜竟是我的人生上一個鴻溝、｜這一晝夜之前、我是共産主義的擁護者、是共産黨的忠實信徒、這一晝夜之後、我竟是最勇敢的反共的先鋒、</p>
<p>雖然一晝夜只有二十四小時、是很短促的時間、在這很短促時間之内、我前後竟判若兩人、然而這却不能說明我是意志薄弱、朝秦暮楚、反覆無常、因爲我在共産黨内有七年的歷史、在這悠久的歲月中、我没有一時一刻不是爲共産主義而奮鬥、我曾被捕入獄、受過非刑的拷打、我曾在疆塲上和所謂「敵人」肉搏、不止一次的受着重創、我曾亡命山澤、三天没有米粒下肚、我曾每天早晨五時起床、在大雪紛飛風雨交加中、守着工廠門口等人、直到夜間一時、才得睏覺、這樣艱難困苦的生活、我繼續七年之久、我没有絲毫改變我的態度、對於我的信仰、没有絲毫的動摇、可是我這次竟在二十四小時之内、轉變的信仰、理由非常簡單、是我七年來血的經騐、在七年來的苦鬥中、使我深刻的明瞭共産主義不適合於中國國情、共産黨是中國革命的障碍物、要想完成中國革命、首先要消滅破壞中國革命的中國共産黨、因此、我堅决的毫不遲疑的從共産黨的隊伍中、走到三民主義的反共最前綫來、</p>
<p>二·我的家庭、原來是富裕的農民、同時也是手工業的老板、因爲帝國主義的掠奪及封建殘餘束縛的結果、在我開始進學校讀書時、便已開始破産、等到我走進中學校時、家庭對於我的求學費、竟一文也不能供給、這樣歷史的長鞭、便策動我於十四年加入了國民黨、當然、我加入國民黨之後、是很努力工作的、因此共産黨便用種種的方法來拉攏我、在十五年九月間、我便在「共産黨是帮助國民革命的、牠能加强國民革命的力量促進三民主義的實現、由三民主義的道路、走到共産主義社會」武斷宣傳之下、加入了共産主義青年團、翌年二月、在武漢中央軍校讀書時、加入了共産黨、那時在爭取「中國革命領導權」口號之下、努力的工作着、及南京清黨後、便在「打倒背叛革命的資産階級」口號之下、參加西征戰役、（卽和楊森夏斗寅部隊作戰）武漢清黨時、中央軍校被解散、改編爲四軍敎導團、旋到九江、又被繳械回來、亡命於鎭江·揚州·鹽城、流連數月、十七年參加本地支部工作、旋又調充徐海蚌特委秘書、同年十一月、被捕入獄、迄十九年九月、恢復自由、擔任江南省委文書科主任、旋卽調充鐵路總工會秘書、後又調互濟會江蘇省總秘書、二十年三月、任江南區總主任、五月、調任上海市總主任、九月、調充江蘇外縣互濟會工作巡視員、十二月、任總會組織部幹事、二十一年二月、帮助滬東區總工作、四月、任滬東區總主任、旋被撤消工作、八月、調充總會秘書長、這是我在共産黨内七年來的經歷、也就是我堅决站到反共最前綫的基礎、</p>
<p>三·在這七年來的苦鬥中、這七年來血的經騐中、使我深深的感覺到、</p>
<p>㈠自有共産黨以來、據共産黨自己結論、没有一時一刻不在錯誤路線當中、十五年十六年有陳獨秀機會主義的錯誤、十六年十七年又有瞿秋白盲動主義的錯誤、十八年六次大會、又發生了對於農民問題·職工運動的錯誤、現在共産黨所有什麽爭論、但不久的將來、一定又會發現二十年二十一年的路線也完全是錯誤的、這裏便發生這樣的問題、就是共産黨爲什麽時時刻刻犯錯誤、這一問題正確的回答、就是中國不適宜於共産主義的施行、不適宜於共産黨的存在、無論什麽策略路綫、左的也好右的也好、折中的也好、總是執行不通的、</p>
<p>㈡按照中國的環境、中國的經濟背景、中國革命應該是反帝國主義的民族革命、消滅封建殘餘的民權革命、應該實行節制資本·平均地權的辦法、改良民衆生活、但共産黨的主張、恰恰與此相反、鼓動所謂階級鬥爭來分散民族革命的力量、延長封建勢力的壽命、使全民衆尤其是工人農民、受到破産·失業·流離失所的痛苦、這就是中國共産黨所給予中國民衆的恩物、</p>
<p>㈢對反帝國主義問題、共産黨在空喊「打倒帝國主義」中號之下、來延長商國主義在中國的統治、没有絲毫反帝國主義的實際工作、而且阻碍破壞民衆的反帝運動、尤其是在一二八事變之後、共産黨號召總同盟罷工·農民暴動來反對日本帝國主義、其實這不是反對日本帝國主義、而是破壞反日的統一戰綫、是搗亂抗日的後方、</p>
<p>㈣因爲共産黨完全變成了中國革命的障碍物、所以牠在羣衆中的影響、一天一天的破産、羣衆對於他的號召、已由消極的不睬、轉到積極的反抗、如號召罷工時、工人回答說、「這是共産黨的搗亂」、所以没有那一次罷工是由共産黨號召起來的、號召示威時、羣衆回答說、「這是拿我們開玩笑」、不惟自己不去參加、還勸别人不要去參加、所以没有那一次示威有羣衆去參加、牠向羣衆宣傳共産主義、羣衆說「話是說得不錯、但是辦不到的、」或者說、好處在將來、我們等不到、但目前只有壞處、没有好處、這些都是鐵一般的事實、這些鐵的事實、把極少數羣衆封共産黨的幻想打得粉碎、所以共産黨完全没有羣衆擁護、是一個光桿的幾個野心家的集團、</p>
<p>㈤共産黨在羣衆中旣完全破産、共産黨内部日益走到分崩離析的狀態、大部份的下級幹部、均不滿意於上級的領導、繼續不斷的提出反對的竟見、而這些提出反對意見的下級幹部、時常受到上級的嚴重處罰和打擊、層出不窮的向國民黨自首、最近幾個月中自首的共産黨員、已達五百人以上、這個驚人的數目字、更證明共産黨的崩潰、</p>
<p>㈥因爲中國國情、不適宜於共産黨的存在、所以共産黨的内部、發生很多不同的意見、這些不同的意見、便在組織上成爲各種小組織的背影、有左傾的立三路綫、便有立三派的形成、有右傾機會主義路綫、便有取消派的分化、更有所謂陳紹虞派·周恩來派·種種各式各樣的派别、這些派别、都企圖着挽救共産黨的命運、然而鐵的事實已經證明、這一企圖、完全變成了一個幻想、誰也不能阻止共産黨的崩潰、</p>
<p>㈦共産黨在政治上組織上、完全處於崩潰的境地、現在的共産黨的中央派、爲要維持他最後的統治、一方面採用武斷宣傳、說「中國革命高潮馬上到來、一省或幾省的首先勝利、馬上就要完成、中國蘇維埃革命馬上就會成功、」這樣來欺騙羣衆、來攏絡下級幹部、這樣的宣傳、遠在十八年卽已開始、現在已經四年、所謂日益擴大的蘇維埃區域、仍是東竄西逃的流寇、所謂「馬上到來的革命高潮」、經過三個月準備的「十月革命節」、結果只到了幾十圙的最積極的幹部、這毫無問題的、更使羣衆脫離對共産黨的幻想、更使共産黨的幹部向國民黨自首、因此、在另一方面、他不得不更進一步的採用紅色恐怖的暗殺手段、來延長他最後殘喘、最近斯文里慘案、是共産黨暗殺政策的具體表現、</p>
<p>四·綜上所述、共黨不適於中國國情、隨便什麽策略路綫、都是絶對的執行不通的、必然的得不到羣衆的擁護、必然的要走到崩潰、滅亡的道路、現在事實已經證明這個估量完全正確、但是究竟什麽是中國的出路、</p>
<p>中國是半殖民地的國家一方面受到列强帝國主義的壓迫、别一方面還受封建殘餘的束縛、使中國政治經濟、不能很迅速的上軌道、在國内旣没有很大的地主、又没有很多大的資本家、在這樣情况之下、只有實行民族主義、才能脫離帝國主義的覊絆、只有實行民權主義、方能完成德謨克拉西的政治、只有採用節制資本平均地權的辦法、才能使社會民衆蒙其福利、換句話說、只有實行三民主義、才能建設新中國、才能使中國走向大同、</p>
<p>當然、中國的現狀、有些地方不能令人滿意、然而這些正有其原因、這些原因、固然是帝國主義未放棄其掠奪政策、封建餘孽還繼續的存在、但主要的還是共産黨的搗亂、因爲共産黨實際上是帝國主義及封建餘孽的助手、我們不要站在旁觀地位來抨擊現狀、我們要研究造成這些現狀的原因、並向這些原因作艱苦的奮鬭、換句話說、要想挽救中國、只有堅决起來消滅共産黨、（中央社）</p>

<p>｜｜蔡念蓀君來信｜｜</p>
<p>袁道豐在「新年的夢想」裏說··「中國未來會有一位迭克推多出現，這迭克推多制如不採拿破崙的帝制形式，必採凱末爾的共和形式。而慕沙里尼的那種形式，他是不願採用的。這因爲中國人有這種劣根性，就是··不欲一位高於己上的君主。」｜｜見東方雜誌新年號｜｜昨天我讀歷史講義南北朝的對立及其演化，益信袁氏之言不謬。劉宋的簒晉，齊的簒宋，梁的簒齊，陳的簒梁，以及北周北齊之簒魏，不是都在不願有一位高於己上的君主，所以要取而代之，以滿足「唯多獨尊」的慾望嗎？那種慾望，在某種義意上說，可算得是向上心。但是病根也就在這點··因個人的向上心而阻礙了民族社會的向上之機！在這裏，我有兩點要請記者先生指示，㈠此種向上心（？）怎樣會養成的？㈡何以在别的民族就没有？請有以敎我！</p>
<p>答··來信說得糊裏糊塗，以爲你是個中學學生，我已滿懷的失望，本不願意做答，但讀到末了，看見係轉信的地方是個當典，以爲你或許是個學徒，这就難怪。因將來書錯誤之點，一一指出如下。㈠袁道豐君在東方雜誌上所發表的高論，根本没有根據。所謂『迭克推多』在西文爲Dictator或Diktatur，意即專政。專政是一種國家的政權形式。如蘇聯的國家所採取的是無産階級專政的形式·，歐美的民主國如美，台英，如法，如瑞士，德意志，皆係資産階級德模克拉西專政的形式·，如意大利之西斯蒂土耳其之國民黨政府則是資産階級一黨專政的形式，（摩沙里尼，基瑪爾，不過其代表人耳。）中國現在的政治形式，有人說，已經類似土耳其國民黨的專政，並不勞袁君再來希望或預言什麽『未來』。不過有一點，法西其蒂或土耳其的國民黨本身的政治形式是好是壞，我們暫不研究·，然而土耳其的國民黨已使土耳其巍然成爲一東方獨立國·，意大利的法西斯蒂雖然也是資本國主義社會之極右的勢力，然而牠也還能保持國家的獨立，吾國則何如！我們現在且不要批評什麽『中國人』『不欲一位高於己上的君主』爲我們的『劣種性』，這句話的對不對，只要先請袁君回去研究研究歷史，再來說話。要知道，摩沙里尼和基瑪爾都不是君主，前者的職務等於長期的國務總理，他之上還有君主·，後者是一個共和國的總統，有什麽『君主』不君主？足下因讀歷史，『益信袁君之言不謬』，所謂『劉宋的簒晉··········以及北周，北齊之簒魏』，以爲皆是『因不願一位高於己上的君主，所以要取而代之，以滿足「唯我獨尊」的慾望，」這話更是似是而非之談。因爲南北朝的對立各有牠的物質的條件與政治的背景，所有那時簒竊相循的『唯我獨尊』的禍患，都是當時社會的制度以及專制的歷史所形成，就是說，這種政治上的慘變與惡心理是當時社會制度與專制政治的歷史的産物，是果不是因。足下震於東方雜誌袁君之謬誤，遂不免倒果爲因，受害不淺！致於『向上心』這一名詞的完全被人們誤解了。一個人旣然有了一點學問，並且已博得一點虚聲，然而他並不以此自滿，反而覺得名不符實，深自愧恧，因此越發奮勵向前，精益求精，這是向上心。一個人率兵守土，雖然在敵人的飛機大砲之下，明知迎戰必敗，然而揮戈相抗，死而無悔，這是向上心。一個學徒不甘人們的辱駡凌虐，則發憤讀書，爲一般貧苦的同胞奮鬥，置己身之利害於不顧，這也是向上心。所謂『向上心』，就是要力爭上流，絶不是要做皇帝·，要『先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂』，絶不是『朕肥而天下瘦』的野心·，要以『民吾胞也，物吾與也』爲懷，而非以玉食萬方，擁資百億爲念·，做萬人之公僕而不做一人一姓之走狗。不然，那眞是十足的『劣根性』！老實說罷·，假使足下改口說道··㈠此種向上心怎樣養成的？㈡何以别的民族都有，而我們民族獨無』？倒還可以好好地談談，雖然仍只是嗅到一部分眞理？假是你不滿意上面的答覆的話，請寫信來，我和你談。</p>

<p>｜三比二｜</p>
<p>（香港二十六日電）　一九三二至三三年度之滬港埠際足球賽、今日下午、在此間歡喜谷球塲舉行、中西觀衆、在萬人以上、結果滬隊以三對二擊敗港隊、滬隊得球者、柯萊脫二、陳家球一、港隊得球者、大告山奴及染照各一、滬中衛線甚强、范恩士尤出色、</p>
<p>上海陣綫</p>
<p>勃拉萊　馮運佑　透納　范恩士　軋許　雷米迪休士　陳家球　柯萊脫　傑克　凱芝</p>
<p>香港陣綫</p>
<p>羅渣　劉茂　雅倫　鄧肯　派多　染榮照思路　小告山奴　大告山奴　黃美順　鄭少康</p>
<p>香港一分鐘破門　港隊首先開球、且得風助、乃取攻勢、滬隊努力抵抗、然甫一分鐘、卽爲大告山奴、單刀直入、射進一球、滬隊出軍不利、後衛時現慌張、幸左翼凱芝當沿邊進襲、陳家球亦得機卽乘、然港隊守門羅渣、皆從容救出、凱芝曾有一绝妙機會、惜球爲森柱彈回、柯萊脫亦頻試脚頭、均未命中、後港後衛雅倫失脚、柯萊脫得機射門、惜力弱、爲羅渣救出、柯於彈起時、再以猛射、守門不能救、成一對一、</p>
<p>上海二比一佔先　滬左鋒傑克、見柯萊脫得功、亦思奮發、惜多個人表演、故機會雖佳、均未命中、繼而陳家球得球、盤過派多、卽於二十碼處射門、準而且急、羅渣救之無及、球又入網、上半時滬隊以二比一佔先、</p>
<p>梁榮照一得一失　檸檬時間後、港隊亟圖反攻、攻門甚急、繼而凱芝傷足、滬以十人應戰、港進攻益烈、後凱芝復入塲、方謂聲勢頓轉雄壯、不料馮運佑失脚、幾頻於危、將完塲十分鐘前、滬范恩士在罰球區外犯規、梁榮照主罰、球從門之右角身入、乃成二對二、此時雙方攻打均烈、往來迅速、至爲精彩、不料此時馮運佑忽在罰球區内罰規、此球頗有幾分可疑、故梁榮照主踢、有意過門不入、踢成野球、博得全塲掌聲、</p>
<p>柯萊脫最後立功　斯時滬隊地位頗危、因陳家球忽告傷足、幸未幾卽入、到最後一分鐘、卒被柯萊脫射入一球、定勝負之局、結果滬隊以三比二獲勝、綜觀全局、滬聯絡極佳、中衛范恩士最出色、後衛較弱、守門勃拉萊是日似較羅渣爲佳、港中衛線、除梁榮照外、餘均平平、</p>
<h3 id="c191">敗於華聯 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>｜二比五｜</p>
<p>（香港二十八日電）　上海埠際足球隊、星期四日曾以三與二之比·擊敗香港埠際隊·今日下午以二對五敗于香港華聯、上海隊代表、除以海氏代替雷米迪外、餘均未動、觀者達一萬七千人、爲本季新紀綠、</p>
<p>上海隊陣線</p>
<p>勃拉萊　魯運佑　透納　范恩士　軋許　海氏休士　陳家球　柯萊脫　傑克　凱芝</p>
<p>港華聯陣線</p>
<p>林天燦　劉茂　李天生　鄧光　林玉英　梁榮照陳光耀　葉北華　馮景祥　譚江柏　鄭少康</p>
<p>華聯隊實力雄厚　上半時港華聯以一對０佔先、實力確屬雄厚、下半時、華聯雖增加四球、但上海隊若球運好、至少亦可命中四只、港華聯得球者、譚江柏馮景祥各二、葉北華一、上海隊得球者、陳家球一、柯萊脫一、</p>
<p>上半時成一比零　上半時華聯多取攻勢、開球一分鐘、葉北華卽得射門機會、但未命中、上海隊及反攻、華聯後衛踢出、馮景祥送球兩翼、極有把握、上海守門勃拉特萊、撲地球一由鄭少康踢來之險球、與葉北華相撞、負傷出塲、數分鐘後復入、旋譚江柏以絆倒軋許受警告軋許欲舉足射門、見凱芝在側、傳交與凱、此球不幸偏出、柯萊脫亦有數次、因傳與兩翼、不卽射門、致失去大好機會、譚江柏得馮景祥來球、盤通逸納、在球門口一脚而中、上半時、港華聯一、上海０、</p>
<p>馮景祥亦告中的　下半時續賽、傑克失去一打空門機會、軋許傳球極準、柯萊脫曾殺入華聯腹地、惜射門時變成野球、凱芝極爲活躍、其射球每使林天燦不能捉摸、又不幸適中横木、如是者可二次、均未造就、斯時上海隊全取攻勢、但華聯一理得勢、卽立功而返、蓋上海隊方面、曾失去無數機會也、當海氏手忙脚亂之時、馮景祥又爲華聯射中一球、</p>
<p>柯萊脫奪回一球　滬隊屢攻不入、反續失一球、可謂不幸已極、但向華聯壓迫之聲勢、並不以此稍減、一再努力、中鋒柯萊脫、亦爲上海建立一功、蓋華聯守門此時已如衆矢之的、柯萊脫得休士之傳遞、遂中要害、</p>
<p>陳家球一頂而中　譚江柏旋以神速之脚頭、射入一球、而上海隊陳家球亦得凱芝之巧妙傳中、一頂而入、此時比數、爲華聯三·上海二、局勢之緊張、得未曾有、觀衆呐喊、加倍起勁、爲香港球賽中所罕見、</p>
<p>五比二華聯大勝　最後二球、均於五分鐘造成、休士得傑克之傳球、距球門僅三碼本可一脚而入、造成平手、但休士不能利用此大好機位、遂致一蹶不振、當衆人在上海隊球門前混戰之際、勃拉萊傷頭、出塲數分鐘始入、旋看台上失火、看客視線、爲之轉移、後卽撲滅、上海隊於是大舉進攻、海氏一脚遠射、幾乎命中、華聯興兵反攻、馮景祥得葉北華之傳遞、射入一球、而葉亦於三十碼處射入、港華聯遂以五對二之比、獲最後勝利、</p>

<p>津隊獲得錦標　當津滬俄僑開賽時、世界象棋大王厄蘭根適來滬、乃被邀舉行開球禮、津隊前鋒堅硬、進取甚力、射門不精、反被滬隊首開紀錄、上半時滬隊一對零占先、下半時津隊氣燄甚盛、一再中的、連拔三關、滬隊努力反攻、奪來一球、終以二對三失敗、第一届錦標、及公共租界警務處俄僑合贈大銀盃一隻均歸津隊所有、</p>

<p>去冬銀圓運往大連之約計</p>
<p>一月二十五日爲吾人習慣上之廢歷大年夜、亦爲商業各界結帳之總末日、全年營業手續、槪須是日終了、銀錢業亦如之、故收解手續之多、亦爲全年中这最繁瑣者、計外商銀行收解總額達四五千萬、而華商銀行方面收解亦有六七千萬、進倉外商二百二十萬、華商一百二十萬、錢莊銀公單收解六千餘萬、洋公單收解二千餘萬、洋釐市價、早市爲七錢一分二釐二毫半、午市爲七錢一分二釐七毫半、交易早市一百八十二萬五千、午市八十四萬、支單早市六萬五千、午市七萬、鈔票兩市均無交易、銀拆因拆票交易已告終了、無市可開、故早午市均無行情、江南小洋早市爲六錢０八釐半、午市爲六錢二分、兩市間頓好一分一釐半、交易早市七千五百角、午市一萬五千角、廣東小洋早市爲五錢九分五釐半、午市同價、交易早市十三萬五千角、午市三萬五千角、銀元加長五千文、爲四百０五千文、交易四萬九千八百餘串、</p>

<p>棉花市况、亦以春季爲最高、彼時交易所舊存交易、固與棉紗一併結價割清、而外面現棉交易尙有活動、因租界中之紗廠仍有開工、惟日紗廠則完全停止工作耳、無如以虽事影響、各路交通阻礙、來源凋零、故棉價頓見鋒利、陜西花現貨售價最高到三十五兩、美花亦至七分二厘、及戰事停止、日軍撤退、從前轉口之美印棉紛紛復運來滬、交易所標花亦於五月二日起開市、因棉紗標準改訂爲二十支人鐘之故、棉花標準亦改用鄭州細絨花、開市之日、價爲三十二兩外、至六月中、美棉因銷費不振、存數達一千三百四十四萬九千包、農部局存棉一百三十萬、將半數售出、市盤暴落、發見空前未有之新低峯、（每磅跌至美金五分進關）本市又在日軍大刦之後、金融緊縮、紗價猛跌、紗廠停工多至三四個月、棉花去路復轉呆滯、弱點一露、狂暴疊至、去年（二十一年）各省大水、棉商深慮棉作受害、訂有巨額外棉、届時紛紛到埠、頗以積懘爲患、對於本棉自無意再進、於是魯豫等花價、一致慘落　天津一處存貨甚厚、西河棉價慘落更甚、金融界損失不資、花商倒閉不少、四方惡劣消息頻頻而來、套賣者日見踴躍、市塲驚惶之狀、不堪方喻、同時寗波姚花交易所發生絶大風潮、開市只有賣出、而無買進、一時相持不下、經當局維持、暫行收進、設法來申套出、「屋漏更遭連夜雨」七月份標花乃發見近年來二十七兩（改算舊標準爲二十五兩二錢）之最低紀錄、正在窮極無聊之際、忽來一海外之訊、謂美棉以氣候變化、雨水過量、損害棉田、蟲患亦日見嚴重、漲風突起、八月八日美政府估計、較大衆預料减少一百萬包、爲一千一百三十萬零六千包、飛漲八十五磅音、漲風升騰、竟由六分漲至九分二、迫近一角關口、本節標棉最高曾達三十五兩七錢、某廠商卽在期現市塲上作大量的抛賣、空額有二十三四萬擔之巨、佔市上三分之二、壓迫尤重、詎料美棉二次估計、（九月八日發表）暴落一百餘磅音、世界棉市同爲震動、一致慘跌、有如青天霹雳、標花一盤跌去一兩七八錢、美棉就此徐徐而下、查其狂跌原因、爲天氣轉好、生産漸增、而歐美商業不景氣、消費减少、至最後一期、十二月八日、産額增至一千二百七十二萬七千包、現貨價遂由八月之九分二直跌至十二月初之五分七厘、本埠棉市整個的爲其擊破矣、樑花由八月之三十五兩七錢直跌至十一月初之廿九兩七五、但華棉至十一月間、又以金價飛騰、發現八百卅餘兩之新高價、外棉採算來滬不通、四處到申之貨缺乏、投機商店活動購進、且北方雨水過多、黃河决口、冀魯晋諸省均被淹没、棉田損害甚鉅、産額估計由一千零八十二萬九千一百六十二担减至八百零九萬四千八百六十三担、此固爲本棉上漲之最大理由也、故至歲末標花價、又見三十四兩六五、特將鄭標花一年間高低價交割價及總成交數量列表於後、</p>

<p>（註四）有×記號者爲近期（七月期）價</p>
<p>棉花現貨狀况、春季雖有一度爲供求不繼而漲、但不久仍爲紗銷呆滯而沉寂、自入厦季、新棉情形良好、本埠各廠有賒借美棉五十萬包之說、紗廠業曾一度召集會議、後以條件關係未成事實、秋季美棉以蟲害而發現激烈之漲風、本棉有一度之暢銷、火機花由六月之二十七兩直漲至八月之三十三兩、陜西花由二十七兩五錢直漲至三十五兩、彼時日廠吸收火機花期貨有十餘萬担、價格約三十四五兩、華廠購進較少、詎料美棉二次估計發生意外之變化、現棉交易驟見冷淡、日廠購進之火機花十萬担、作價三十二兩、結價不收、市上頓有此大批現貨、十月份火機花價又退到二十八兩二五、時交易所中多空兩方角逐劇烈、永安廠决意購進收貨、申新則買現交貨、交割量有五萬零六百担、爲一年來最我之數也、</p>
<p>至十二月間本埠棉市突現漲風、形勢殊覺緊張、且有軋空之風聲、查其原因、謂某廠之空額太巨、無盡量之交貨力、而金價趨漲、外棉採算銀盤、難以抵申、國内紡織必須購辦華棉應用、本棉之銷費、必不似上年之清淡、此點足予棉市之最大助力、於是一般投機商羣爭購進、市盤遂漲、日商在市採辦現棉尤形𤍠鬧、現貨陜西花由三十一兩漲三十三四兩、然世界棉業仍在過剩時代、美棉生産連上年滾存總計有二千六百十七萬六千包、而全世界消費祇需要一千二百五十萬至三百萬包左右、吾國生産較上年爲佳、（據中華棉産改進會估計有八百餘萬担）　吾全國紗線錠子計四百餘萬枚、全年消費原棉需八九百餘萬担、自己亦可供給矣、且紗市在此疲途不振中、廠方對於原料隨用隨購、就大勢狀况察之、前途仍無積極之漲力、茲將全年現棉成交之價格高低列表於後、以資參考、（二月份因暴日侵滬停市·單位兩）</p>
<p>洋花輸入、遠在數十年前、但其時數量無多、價不過十餘萬兩、光緒季年、以紗廠事業之興辦、洋花進口亦日增、然其時民夙樸素、粗布之衣、欲望已足、尙無需乎細絨之棉、及後漸感細絨棉之需求正殷、提倡美棉聲浪日高、乃以政治人事氣候地土等等關係、荏苒迄今三十餘載、改良棉種之成績、雖具而實微、習尙亦日形奢侈、昔者粗布之衣衫以爲足、今則非細布絲光布難壓其欲望矣、於是美棉等進口自民國九年以來、價值恒在千餘萬兩以上、至二十年以各廠旺辦洋棉之故、進口價值與洋米屹然居首、卽紗花亦不得不提高至二十支紗及以細絨爲標準矣、生活日高、原非不幸事、其爲事事外求、本國農産亦息息受洋貨之影響、不能保持其地位、若米也棉也、無一不然、結果所屈、勢將一無所得、仰給於外來、國計民生、祇見其蹙、不見其裕、不用兵戈、已可將吾屈伏矣、茲列國外棉市塲棉價如左、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>槍殺馮德謙的主謀者鄭國有，在香港審判十餘次·，雖經延聘外或律師多人，在堂上侃侃雄辯·，然而，逃不出「殺人者死」的專條，卒被判處死刑。擁有巨額金錢的富家兒，畢竟難延一命，這便是纨袴子的悲哀！鄭國有是已故南洋甲必丹鄭貴的孫兒，鄭貴僑居馬來　的霹靂埠，在外人指導之下，建　有開關大小霹靂埠的大功，因此，遂成鉅富。他致富以後，頗能努力於公益事務，在華僑中很有相當的好譽·，鄭貴死，其子鏡堂｜卽鄭國有的父親，亦相繼逝世，這時，鄭國有年僅六歲，便成了舞祖無父的孤兒。這段情由，香洪紳商黃廣田等二百四十人叙入聯禀裏面，代懇香港總督貸其一死·，然而，議政避已拒絶紳商聯禀，不能因乃祖的功績，豁免不肖孫兒的死刑，這便是紈誇子的悲哀！</p>
<p>鄭母在兩星期前親去探監，鄭國有已一變了向日的驕縱狀態·，遏住了滿腹悲哀，好言慰母道··「兒的獄中生活，臥有褥，食有魚·，望阿母寛心。」鄭母含涙道··「兒嬌養慣，今不比在家時，卽無白米飯，雖飯焦，亦只好下咽。」國有俯首受命，涙如雨下，這便是紈袴子的悲哀。</p>
<p>港商的聯禀，是前清翰林賴褾熙所撰，中有一段云··「鄭國有年僅六歲，卽無嚴父指導，而承有巨額家産，其母孀居寡出，於其品行無從敎訓，於其舉動無從管束，年事漸長，嗜欲漸開，挾其資財，遂諭軌範，陷溺於不規則之娛樂，結交不正當之淫朋。」把國有失敎情形，說得透切，這便是紈袴子的悲哀！</p>
<p>最近的香港消息，議政局卒徇紳商的請求，改處鄭國有無期徒刑。或者，賴翰林文字有　，禀中所說·，「以一文弱青年，不識不知，因擁有資財，爲歹徒所艷慕，設以陷阱，誘之惑之，以至身罹刑辟，實可憐憫，」云云，得到相當的效果·，但是，無期徒刑，去死幾何？而且，更有無窮的苦痛，這便是紈袴子的悲哀！</p>

<p>｜任環禦倭之追溯｜</p>
<p>雪霽念榆關風雲，適朝陽譚雅聲書來，謂日機已三月不來，今以侵𤍠亟，又來廻翔，其情狀與去年今日之蘇州相似。魯陽之戈，何日可揮，思之思之，深爲苦悶！偶讀山海漫談，記明嘉靖時禦倭事，大嚼屠門，聊且快意。漫談爲明長洲人任環所撰，以進士歷官至蘇州府同知，禦倭寇大小一百十戰，斬級五萬餘顆，保障二十餘城。某歲倭寇犯蘇州，城門晝閉，民繞城號呼，環晝納之，全活者數萬計。倭寇奪民舟出海，環要擊之於馬蹟山，踞嘉定者，火蒸之盡死。後人但知戚繼光禦倭有功，不知任環實居中堅，方弗翁照垣之於十九路軍也。然環一書生耳，洵難能矣。漫談中有減字木蘭花詠吳淞云··「翻來覆去，淋漓秋雨何時在？江上兵船，破浪衝鋒已半年。祲氛未掃，多愁不覺容顔老。仗劍西風，慷慨悲歌樽酒中。』悲壯不減岳武穆之滿江紅也。其他如「夷窟分明消虎豹，東南依舊見承平。」『修齊自是男兒事，頭上休空負此巾。』『萬人學敵渾閒事，只有心兵克敵難。』『三尺龍泉書萬卷，丈夫何處不爲家。』讀之氣旺。其時詩人投贈篇章者，有歸有光之「經身殺賊有任公。」「童子皆知任别駕，巋然海上作金城。」文徵明之『夷虜東來偶震驚，使君仁武自長城。』唐順之之『賊畏如范韓，海外稱任爺。』聞淵之『帆拂扶桑夷國恐，威存天險將才雄。』王榖祥之『古今儒將幾人稱？公實胸中有甲兵。』皆推崇備至。今日至木瀆平望，見敵樓危立，猶能想見先烈之血戰功高。四百年後，淞滬重遭蹂躪，任公有知。感憤何如。余謂此等血性文字，正宜使青年學子書萬遍誦千巡也。</p>

<p>— 胡梯維</p>
<p>於是等藥方脫稿，立刻再派長年上百里外的日里撮藥。一面，紅葉的哥哥，趕往五里外朋友處借大烟傢俱，因爲Ｘ醫生是喜歡燒　兩口頑頑的。父親也似乎高興一點，特地吩咐呌一桌豐盛的菜，請間壁張老伯作陪，替醫生洗塵。</p>
<p>第二天，醫生去了，藥也撮了。單是一對哈蚧，要二二塊錢。紅葉同哥哥，親自抖藥包下罐，小心翼翼看着炭火。彷彿父親的性命，就在這小小一對蛤蚧身上。</p>
<p>吃了三劑，似乎看着腫退一點，Ｘ醫生又來了。</p>
<p>「如何？我說令尊的病，晚生有把握。可是也幸虧早了一脚，不然，連我都棘手了。照目前的形勢，大約吃十幾劑，腫都可以退盡。」</p>
<p>他開了五張脈案，便停止了。方中有鹿茸血片，又是要上Ｈ城去辦的。</p>
<p>「這鹿茸很貴，最好你們去買一隻，慢慢的自己切片，來得合算。帶兩百塊錢去，終差不多了。」</p>
<p>紅葉的哥哥，知道鹿茸是最辛𤍠的東西，不知宜吃宜吃？請示父親的結果，是「疑人莫用，用人莫疑。」如法泡製吃下去，却也奇怪，旣不見壞，也不見好。</p>
<p>Ｘ醫生的第三次作風，在烟榻上又齊一變而至於魯。</p>
<p>「令尊夜不安枕，是心腎不交。玩兩口這東西，實在最對症也没有？」</p>
<p>這一味本草所不收的靈藥，紅昆仲和母親秘密會議之下，一致認爲事屬可行。不過，明知這是父親生平所深惡痛疾的一樣東西，未見得肯破戒，也只可姑妄言之。果然，母親一開口，就碰釘子，而且父親還氣吼吼地將大紅大紫的Ｘ醫生，背地訓斥了一頓。嚇得紅葉弟兄，不敢再開口。</p>
<p>可是同時有許多來探望父親病症的人，都異口同聲地問起一句··「可曾試抽這鴉片没有？」（五）</p>
<p>流動着車輛，往還着人羣。</p>
<p>我現在披露的是都市中肉豓一角，這樣的表現在都市裏産生是平凡的，於此可見被壓迫的歡娛下慘然的就是許多被社會環境所造成堕落的中華女性，被異國的禽獸在狂暴中去侮辱與蹂躪·，</p>
<p>在一個咖啡店裏，也就在北四川路繁華代表作的從靶子路到虬江路中間，外邊有年紅鐙的廣告。這咖啡店裏除了幾個穿白長背心制服的女招待之外，有七八個穿得花花綠綠的女性，身體雖不十分合于都市女性苗條得嬝娜生姿，但年紀都很輕，面上的粉像粉壁，唇上的口紅也像血盆，口音有的是南方，有的是江北，有一個四十多歲的婦人率領着，伊們這一羣專們接待異國民族的過客與兵士，伊們好像一架活動的機器，伊們接到了顧客就同到靶子路由咖啡店老閭租借的秘密處所去實行火坑中的表現，所得的代價·，大約是十塊錢，由咖啡店老閭與那老鴇般的婦人四六分肥，伊們好幾個身上已經有琉黃氣味，伊們今朝復明朝的給外國民族在被壓迫下去侮辱與蹂躪。有的每一個晚不止接一個女性，有的逢醉飽的水手幾個人向一個女性去姦淫。啊爲的是被收賣了去同老鴇婦及咖啡店老閭掙錢。這個地方是充滿了血腥與没有光明，完全是黑暗，參酷，殘忍的人肉市塲般地獄的情味。</p>
<p>啊這樣都市背景中罪惡形成的一角，我希望正義與人道之炬光去照見它，不要讓它永遠的黑暗下去，使一般磨難的女性永遠這樣沉淪下去纔好！</p>

<h3 id="c217">在舊歷歲首年尾的蘇州 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>國暦雖已改用了許久，但因民間習俗的相沿，舊暦的權威，依然占着優勢·，二十二年來，兀是弄成陰盛陽衰的局面。就以蘇州而言，國暦新年，祇有學校和官署，放幾天例假，點綴點綴外，社會上，依舊像對付東北問題般的，永遠在鎭靜期間。可是到了舊暦年關，却大大起着變動了。下面記的化絮，就是蘇州在舊暦歲首年尾的景象</p>
<p>㈠歲尾間的家庭</p>
<p>撣簷塵　蘇州不論在家小户，在每年年底，須先將屋中的灰塵，來一下澈底的清潔運動。上至棟梁，下及壁角，統統糞除一週，呌做「撣簷塵。」蘇州有句俗語，呌一事無成，先撣簷塵。」因爲撣簷塵，是度歲的第一件工作。那日子都擇着黃暦上的水日。取避免火災的意送竈與謝年　吃飯，確乎是人生一大難事！於是東廚司命的竈君，就得到舊家庭的無上敬禮。在舊暦年底的二十三二十四兩天，是竈敬上升天庭申奏每家善惡的日子。蘇州在這兩天中，家家都備着紙轎，設着素筵，恭送那竈君升天。在送竈的筵上，須供着一隻來糖製的元寳，竈君吃了甜頭，申奏時才會祇說好話。這可笑的迷信舉動，現代兀是保存。在蘇州的社會上。至於謝年，是備着鷄魚三牲，供齋神禘，以表感謝的意思。謝年的日子，有的年年在固定的日子舉行的，有的却選擇黃道吉日。而那畫着神像的軸子，也在謝年那天，懸掛廳堂之上。</p>
<p>年夜飯　祭先之後，那滿滿的菜肴，就邀着親友，圍着家人，宴啖起來。席間互布菜肴，並說着吉祥語言。像魚，說「有餘」，筍，「節節高」，蝦，「灣灣順」，鷄，「撲撲長」，橘，一「團福」，線粉，「金鏈條」，那青菓，蚶子，蛋餃等等，却通稱「賺元寳」。而每碗飯底，都藏着一個熟茡　，呌做掘藏。｜掘得藏鏹的意。那飯是夜間吃的，呌年夜飯。</p>
<p>封井接竈　舊暦大除夕，家家人家，因舊竈君已升天而去，東廚又不能永遠虚位，於是新竈君，就在歲尾蒞任就職了。同時井也封閉了，供奉那位水表（勢利諧聲）小人的井泉童子。接着就爆竹封户，實行那「爆竹一聲除舊」的古話。</p>
<p>㈡歲尾時的社會</p>
<p>說會書　說書是「獨出一張嘴」的蘇州人拿手好戲。馬如飛，柳敬亭，固然是過去的社會聞人，光裕社，也是蘇州現代有力的民衆團體。說會書，是在每年歲尾，每書塲，由四個或五個說書者，挨着登臺演唱。會書所說的書，是注重滑稽的·，有幾個說得好的，聽的人哈哈大笑，他的名聲，得聽客口頭宣傳，就跟着紅將起來。可是口才不佳的，因說會書的人數，被喝下臺的，可以不算數的緣故，常受到被喝下的窘處。至於會書的售欵，說書的人，祇取銅元二百，其餘的，一半是茶寮的進益，一增却是書業公會和裕才小學的常年經費。</p>
<p>送元寳　茶寮，浴室，到了年底，那堂倌對於平日的老主顧，送一小蒲包橄欖。和幾隻橘子，呌做送元寳。受的人，致少要出一元的償錢。同時浴室和理髪的價目，過了二十四日，也照平日飛漲一倍。</p>
<p>花花絮絮　年底糕糰和茶食店的年糕，堆得像小山一般，天竹和臘梅，也出賣着做歲朝清供，而成羣的乞丐更裝了烏龜，黃牛，一羣來，一羣去的滿街討錢。大除夕的電燈光下，依然發現着拎了燈蘢的索債的人。</p>

<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>爲一二八週年祭而作</p>
<p>敵人方面準備好的第二次總攻擊，就在一兩天中間要爆發了。情形更嚴重起來，從東京派來的新總司令也到了，海軍陸戰隊在平時是誇耀過的，現在每天受到中國兵隊意外的打擊，就加增了許多精銳的陸軍。每天還聽到無數的日本兵慘殺中國老百姓的事情。好幾百人給捉了去囚在屋子裏鞭打，有的餓着肚子去給他們做苦工。</p>
<p>近來路上更不好走了，三得要冒着險每天去賣報賺幾個銅子也不成了。他們已經跟附近熟悉的兵士商量好，祇要把當塲死了的弟兄的槍械那些東西每人拿到了一副，那就可以站在戰綫上跟兵隊一起去打了，在此刻這種時候，也顧不得上邊的名册那些事，瞄準槍頭跟帝國主義者抵抗就得了。</p>
<p>三得大發和阿根，他們打聽好今兒晚上這一路大槪没有戰事，就在傍晚加入了這隊伍，跟他們熟悉的幾個，眞的找機會把東西全弄好了。這兒一團人，從開戰那天起，已經傷死一小半了·，每個臉上都瞧得出滿是憔悴的樣子，不過還是高興得有勁兒。每天只睡到兩三個鐘頭，可是誰都不說倦，一聽到敵人的槍聲總是立刻就清醒了。</p>
<p>幾個伙伴把槍彈怎麽上膛怎麽開撥的事都敎了他們，又把手榴彈怎麽丢擲的經騐也敎給了他們。</p>
<p>「殺人都是這麽簡便的！」一個周三保的笑着說。</p>
<p>「殺人簡便，命令可就不簡便，只聽說日本帝國主義一次次的下總蓖　令，我們這兒要個攻擊命令可眞難！前天包抄的時候眞可以把敵人一下子就弄得没頭没腦的，可是又命令我們不要衝過去，老周，不是嗎？團長也有點兒生氣，不過他知道若是他手下的弟兄們閙翻了那也不行的，到底仍舊要吃上邊的虧，所以他上一次學了乖，那次也就服從了命令。我們可眞恨透了，明明給包圍了的敵人急得一點兒没法想，他們左翼受了這樣大傷，全部都會恐慌的，倒又那樣輕輕的放過了！」</p>
<p>「我們後來閣着問團長，他也祇好說是因爲全部軍事計劃的缘故，没法想的。眞該死！」</p>
<p>天黑了好一會兒，晚飯才送來了。</p>
<p>「喂，王寳林，晚飯送得這麽晏，每天好喫幾頓啊？」大發問着旁邊一個扁臉的，，他那餓了兩天的肚子，看見飯就格外「咕咕」的呌了起來。</p>
<p>「白天他們怕飛機不敢送，晚飯這時候喫，不到天亮早飯又送來了。」</p>
<p>大家把碗裏的飯都盛得結結實實的，拿到一點菜就很快的把飯呑下去。差不多大家喫到第二碗的時候，很清楚的步槍跟機關槍聲音發作了。剛走上戰綫的他們三個，立刻停着飯碗，問别的伙伴。周三保就告訴他們這聲音不是正面的敵人，並且也不是正式作戰的，這種情形常常有，不過是敵人來試試的。</p>

<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>古時候，做女人大晦氣，一舉一動，都是錯的，這個也駡，那個也駡。現在這晦氣落在學生頭上了，進也挨駡，退也挨駡。</p>
<p>我們還記得，自前年冬天以來，學生是怎麽閙的，有的要南來，有的要北上，南來北上，都不給開車。待到到得首都，頓首請願，却不料『爲反動派所利用』，許多頭都恰巧『碰』在刺刀和槍柄上，有的竟『自行失足落水」而死了。</p>
<p>誰提一句抗議呢？有些人還笑駡他們。</p>
<p>還要開除，還要告訴家長，還要勸進研究室。一年已來，好了，總算安靜了。但不料山海關失了守，上海還遠，北平却不行了，因爲連研究室也有了危險。住在上海的人們想必記得的，去年此日的曁南大學，勞動大學，研究室裏還坐得住麽？</p>
<p>北平的大學生是知道的，並且有記性，這回不再用頭來「碰」刺刀和槍柄了，也不再想「自行失足落水」，却發明了一種新方法，是··大家走散，各自回家。</p>
<p>這正是這幾年來的敎育顯了成效。</p>
<p>然而又有人來駡了。童子軍還在烈士們的輓對裏，說他們「遺臭萬年」。</p>
<p>但我們想一想··不是連語言歷史研究所裏的没有性命的古董都在搬家了麽？不是學生都不能每人有一隻飛機麽？能用本國的刺刀和槍柄「碰」得瘟頭瘟腦，躱進研究室裏去的，倒能並不瘟頭瘟腦，不被外國的飛機大砲，炸出研究室外去麽？</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>｜在上海文藝茶話會談話</p>
<p>尊貴的先生女士們··</p>
<p>××先生要我談談關於文藝的意見喔！文藝是多麽高貴的東西，我們鄕下人是談不來的。</p>
<p>剛才孫福熙先生從梅花談到蘭花，說蘭花生在深山中，她那一股幽香怎樣引動人·，說採蘭花的怎樣披荊棘，入深谷，上危崖，千難萬苦，方才採到·，說美人香草怎樣詠在古今文人的詩篇，又說到蘭花的孤芳自賞，和愛美的美術家文學家一樣高貴。</p>
<p>失敬失敬！我們鄕下人倒不知道蘭花有這們高貴。去我家不過百來步遠，一道矮矮的山崗，那些茅草窩裏就有很多的蘭花·，成把成筐的採，一柱香時光，可以找到幾十茁，從來不曾入什麽深谷，上什麽危崖。二十年前，我在金華讀書，看見蘭花賣二百四十文一擔，覺得十分奇怪·，誰知蘭花還有這麽高貴的身分，眞是失敬得很！</p>
<p>恭維了梅花，又要恭維蘭花·，恭維了蘭花，又要恭維牡丹芍藥·，春天的美術家文學家眞是一日萬幾呀！我們鄕下人，看過了菜花，山上的杜鵑花紅得起勁了，滿山滿谷，先先後後，總有三十來天可看·，看過杜鵑花，滿野的菖蓿花，又十分閙了。春天田事正忙，從來没工夫去恭維她們，她們還是年年開得起勁呢！</p>
<p>聽說城裏富貴人家，總養着三五隻哈吧狗，階前蒼下，總擺幾盆蘭花·，這倒是一對銖兩相稱的搭擋，會得小姐少爺老爺太太們的歡心的··</p>
<p>原諒我們鄕下人，懂不得這兩種高貴寳物的好處··</p>
<h3 id="c221">蝦和鱔及其他 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 彭家煌</p>
<p>一切生物都有其生活方式和抵禦外侮的本能。半以角鬥·，虎豹以爪牙鬥·騾馬以蹄鬥·，没有武器的，便賴保護已避免敵人的侵襲。如菜蟲，全身綠色，躱在菜葉裏，使敵人難以發覺。如墨魚，感到生命危險時，便射出墨汁，　身墨汁中，使敵人難於辨認。其餘能力薄弱的下等生物，便藉偉大的繁殖力維持種族的延續，如蜉蝣，如臭蟲虱子，雖朝生暮死，雖被人不斷的捕捉，牠們總有機會和人類共存共榮！</p>
<p>記得是去年的中秋節，女人買了蝦和鱔。那時我在没有「國難」的寗波，心想寗波的蝦和鱔也會没有「國難」的。本來，人是强者，動物之王，吃猪肉，吃牛肉，殺鷄烹羊，這是常事。我也是閑得無聊，才去注意這不久以後就會進自己的口的動物。蝦在籃裏跳，繼在水桶裏扭來扭去。我想，無論怎樣會跳會扭，旣被捕獲且從魚販手中被買來，總是活不成的，而這跳扭的動作也顯然無意義。不過，雖然是微小的免不了一死的東西，但牠在危急存亡之秋，總知道跳，知道扭，使殺牠的仇敵多費工夫，感到麻煩討厭！</p>
<p>蝦祇會笨拙的跳，是比較容易對付的，於是我便祇注意女人怎樣去殺那鱔。她殺鱔是外行。她没有方法捉牢那滑頭的鱔。她想用開水把牠們泡死再來破肚。我說這殺法太笨，吃在口裏没有血的鮮味。她想把鱔頭打扁，那末又有血，又有鮮味，但她打來打去，那鱔反而滑七滑八的像龍蛇一樣飛舞。我告訴她··「你用酒把鱔麻醉起來吧！」果然酒傾在桶裏，鱔嘴動了幾動便像死的一样。一會兒，這許多動物全給解决了。我笑女人··「哈哈，你也是個三等帝國主義者啊！」</p>
<p>從前我在鄕下也殺過鱔，那是蠻幹的，就祇捉牢牠的頭，用小剪刀從頭頭邊一劃，肚破了，扯出腸子，可是這動物没有内部也會掙扎。我也殺過蛙，斷了頭，剥了皮，割去四肢，破開肚，掏出肝肺，但把牠擲在水盆裏，還能跳躍游泳。不過先有動作，没有痛苦的喊呌，也是怪事！總之，像這種動物，在無須掙扎之際還那末費勁的掙扎，眞太笨太無意義！</p>
<p>到底是人類，尤其是華夏之邦的人類來得文雅而有智慧。在没有被捕獲被剥皮之前，先就不跳不扭，而且領導起來，相率不跳不扭。九一八過了，一二八過去了，早已過了週年了，在「自有辦法」的「長期抵抗」「心理抵抗」之中，敵人打進山海關了，猛烈的炸彈雖向善於挑善於扭的𤍠血青年中擲去，畢竟還是不跳，不扭。因爲，那有什麽用呢？那有什麽意義呢？遲早終歸要像蝦和鱔一樣被剥皮的啊！何况十年前早就調查明白，華夏之邦的人類有四萬萬五千萬。你儘管剥皮好了，憑着偉大的繁殖力，三五年内滅族總不會的。</p>

<p>他們還談了些關於敎會的話。聽見哈巴牧師的簡短的宣敎說完了，又要唱歌了，曹世光忙走向人叢圈裏去。他一面走，一面笑着說··</p>
<p>「老林，有空請到我家裏來頑。你的Sweethear也一同來。」</p>
<p>「······禾稇載回家，禾稇載回家！我們來甚歡喜，禾稇收回家！······」</p>
<p>海泉說了一聲「走吧」，他俩便聽着這樣的歌聲離開了人叢。</p>
<p>「那位曹先生是你的好朋友？」</p>
<p>「一个小同鄕。」</p>
<p>「他在敎會裏做什麽？」</p>
<p>「當小書記吧。月薪大洋三十元整！」</p>
<p>「曹先生也這樣的刻薄。······」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「他不是說我是你的，······啊，難爲情死了哟！」</p>
<p>她眞的雙頰緋紅了，泛紅到她的一雙可愛的耳朶下來了。</p>
<p>「由他說算了。給他知道了你是怎樣的人時，他又要造謡生事的。傳出去了，不好聽。」</p>
<p>他俩默默地向前走了一忽。</p>
<p>「回去吧，没有意思。」</p>
<p>「那麽看戲去？」</p>
<p>「還没有到時候呢。」</p>
<p>「在餐館裏去吃一個便飯，再去看戲。」</p>
<p>「回去吧。」</p>
<p>他說着打了一個呵欠。</p>
<p>「林先生，你那樣討厭我麽？」</p>
<p>他俩的視線又碰着了，相對着傻笑了一忽。</p>
<p>二十二</p>
<p>决定了到大馬路Ｔ茶樓去吃夜飯，海泉和鶴子夫人在新世界前下了電車。海泉心裏是異常的警戒，雖恐碰着了同學，碰着了同鄕，認得他和鶴子夫人的。所以他不讚成在大公司前下車，寗可多走幾步路。雖然嫌冷了一點，但鶴子夫人也同意了。</p>
<p>朝東眺望了一下，大上海已經給殘冬的夜色罩住了。三大公司的屋頂花園的彩色電光特别地明亮，從灰白色的夜霧中透射出來。朝江邊望去，視角漸趨砂化，｜尖化至成爲一點的都市的夜景，斷續地裝飾着紅藍各色的尼安電光，别具一種的縮羅。但是站在寒風　眺望害類頽廢的都會的光色，海泉又給一陣的哀愁製住了。他無意　地微　了一口氣。</p>
<p>「那眞對不住」，我這樣地累了你，林先生向鶴子夫人在他的左肩下，略屈了一下身腰壁了他的臉。</p>
<p>「不。你不要多心。我是看見這種雜沓的都會所特有的景象，不知不覺地有點　　而已。認眞地深思一番，的確，人生到底是爲什麽哟！」</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>經騐這兩個字，在中國社會思想上佔着重要的勢力。講話要經騐，做事要經騐，注重經騐而不注重實騐，幾乎成了中國人的特性了！</p>
<p>經騐與眞理是相輔而行的，根據眞理得來的經騐，是最值得寳貴的，可是與眞理無關甚而至於與眞理背馳的經騐，那就不但無益而且有害了！要曉得經騐并不是一件壞的東西，全在用者之善用與否而定其利害。醫學又何嘗不尙經騐呢？醫學的基礎是建築在科學上的，科學的原則第一須要的是實騐，眞理是實騐的結晶，新醫的經騐是根據着實騐來的。也可以說得是眞理的經騐，譬比經騐告訴他是這樣，實騐下來的結果呢？又是那樣，於是立刻知道經騐的報告是完全錯了！舊醫的經騐有兩種分别··一是本於前人的，一是屬於自己的。什麽病用什麽藥，前人是這樣，後人也可以這樣，前人是從經騐得來的，前人的經騐，遺留把後人就變爲眞理，後人祇知默守前人經騐得來的眞理，而不問這個理之是否眞。這就是舊醫治病的秘訣··也就是舊醫學在中國歷數千年而永無進步的最大主因。甲的病是這樣看好的，乙的病與甲的病一樣，就用同樣的治療方法，這樣一天一天的下去，相同的病看得愈多，經騐就愈宏富。可是何以要這樣治療的原因，是永遠不知道的。并且因此也生出一種奇異的現象··同是一個病，甲醫所斷的是這樣，乙醫所斷的是那樣··這是什麽緣故呢？就是他們所用的方法，完全本着經騐來的，早醫的經騐是這樣，乙醫的經騐是那樣，治療之不同是他們經騐的結果，假使用實騐的方法來考查一下，以判定他們的是非，或者可以說兩者都是不對的。這就是一己之經騐。</p>
<p>病情是千變萬化的，同一病狀而不同一病因的很多，差之毫厘，失之千里。經騐祇可以告訴病狀的大槪，而不可以告訴這究竟是什麽病，何以要這樣治療。所以從經騐可以得到一個大槪的範圍，再向這方向去做實騐，然後可得眞理，較之没有經騐的人去做實騐，可以省些時間精力，反之若徒憑經騐，而不做實騐，則這經騐至少有幾分是不可靠的，以之治病，豈不危險。</p>
<p>我的結論是··醫學是客觀的，醫學的經騐，必須加以實騐，由實騐而得來的經騐，乃是眞理。</p>

<p>問·有較兇險的病狀嗎？</p>
<p>答·有一種是進行很快的，體温驟然上昇，脈搏頻數，精神溷濁，三四天後，可以斃命。呌做電擊性流行性感冒。</p>
<p>問·還有别的病型嗎？</p>
<p>答·還有幾種。有一種呌中毒型，大約經過二三星期，又發高熱而致虚脫。也有侵犯肺臟的，呌做肺型，發生肺炎。又有侵犯胃腸的，呌做胃腸型。發生嘔吐泄瀉，血便，腹痛，更有侵犯神經系，呌做神經型，發生腦炎，腦膜炎神經炎，精神病的。</p>
<p>問·流行性感冒的病人，有合併别的病患嗎？</p>
<p>答·有合併結合膜炎，中耳炎，賢炎，心包炎，支氣管周圍炎，副鼻腔蓄膿症等。</p>
<p>問·這種病的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>答·在初起病的時候，服用發汗藥，像醋柳酸，安替比林，非那西汀等。有敗血症的情形時，可注射電銀膠液。或九一四等。至於對症療法，服用袪痰劑，强心劑，鎭咳劑，鎭靜劑等，胸部可行温濕布或消炎泥膏的塗敷。若副身腔蓄膿的時候，有時要行外科的切開術的。</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>（一）早期診斷之重要及早期治療之結果</p>
<p>肺癆雖爲可恐之疾病，如能早期診斷，而加以適當之療養，則决無不愈之虞，惟當患病初期，多不加以深切注意，且或放任，迨至發熱咯血等現象發生，又仿惶錯亂，雖經延發　　，熱甚血止，則以爲病愈，不如肺癆爲慢性疾病，發𤍠咯血，不過疾病中之一種，或一時的現象，偶而退隠，决非病愈，若無醫師之指導，不求身體之修養，增進其抵抗力，則病根潛伏，病勢終有爆發之一日，而陷入重態，斯時就醫，已非全恃醫藥之能爲力，已失去正當治療時期，爲可嘆耳。</p>
<p>肺癆之三個時期　一爲潛伏期，自癆菌侵入人體後，至病狀養作時爲止，其時間可自數月至一二年之久，視各人之抵抗力及環境　晶·　二爲病狀　現期，此期長短不定，有數日即發生危險者，有至數十年之久者，　三爲初愈期，即病人經過治療後，已無自覺的病狀，而漸漸恢復健康，</p>
<p>吾人若能於肺病潛伏期内，加以診斷而施以相當之療養，則事半功倍，可免病狀之發現，但在潛伏期間，診斷頗難，且病人亦不知其有病，更無從延醫檢查，故欲在潛伏期内準備診斷，今日尙未能實現，吾人所宜注意者。厥爲</p>
<p>肺癆之先兆　若汝之體重漸减輕，作事輙覺倦怠，咳嗽連續至一二月以上，時愈時發，而不已者，又食慾不佳，消化不良，或下午發有微熱，夜間夢醒時，胸前或背後出有冷汗，或痰中帶出微量之血絲，或早晨及晚間，咳嗽較甚，早起吐痰者，則須立即請醫檢騐身體，以明是否患有肺病，斯時最不可忽者，乃愛克司光與早期浸潤發現之重要，肺病之早期診斷，實爲治肺之先决問題，惟病之初起，症狀極微，若以吾國舊時之診斷法，如「望問聞切」欲下準確之診斷，實爲不可能者，其黠者於脈案中，多書宜防肺病四字，聊以塞責，此外即騐檢痰液，及聽診打診等法，診斷之，所得之結果，亦屬極微，若使騐痰而發現結核菌，聽診而現各種水泡音，打診而呈濁音，則病者斯時，已臻嚴重病態。並非初期浸潤時期，已失去正當治療期矣，故欲初期浸潤之早期發現，即肺病之早期診斷，非用愛克司光攝影不可，斯時可照出大小不平等之陰影，不特醫者便於治療，即病家亦可知所警惕，早日從事預防及就醫，蓋一舉而數善備焉，又照出之愛克司光，若並無肺病現象，則更屬可喜，不特省去就醫，於經濟及時間上亦可獲益，即身體精神上亦愉快不少，</p>
<p>總之肺病僅恃打診聽診不能檢知早期浸潤之存在與否，在科學未曾發達以前，肺病患者，大多失去本病治療最適宜之時期，以致肺病猖獗，爲人類大敵，苟能設法診斷，早期浸潤，則肺病大有治愈之傾向，故有傳染肺病之虞者，或其家屬親友發生肺病者，身體虚弱者，苟時時覺有微𤍠，手心發𤍠，身體違和，咳嗽等情，宜即行愛克司光檢查，以明病原，則於肺病之預防及治療，必有莫大之進步，而早日治療，肺病必能就痊，則肺病誠不足畏也，所可懼者，病者缺乏早期診斷之要識，大率因循遷延，迨病勢進步，則又藥石雜投，致失去正當治療之時期，爲可憾耳。</p>
<p>讀者識之，苟遇有肺病之嫌疑者，宜勸其即行診斷，須知早日治療，不特身體健康可以早日復元，若金錢時間之經濟，猶其餘事，愚服務醫院以來，見抱病者，大都誤於初期治療之不愼，其於個人，抱憾終身者有之，於家屬遺害妻孥者有之，於社會國家之損失，更無待言，怵目傷心，莫此爲甚，故不覺言之諄諄，世之有心人，幸勿河漢斯言。</p>
<p>肺病與服藥</p>
<p>肺癆患者，而專門迷信藥石，則永無獲愈之望，蓋藥物有二種，一爲有特殊效力的藥物，一爲普通對症的藥物，現時對於肺癆「尙無特效藥」之發見，所服用者，大抵屬於普通性質者，如止咳化痰，開胃補血，止汗强壯等劑是也，故病之初起，若無專門醫師之指導，而但求所謂肺癆聖藥特效藥而服之，是不啻南轅而北轍，余未見其有功也，且所謂各種聖藥特效藥者，在科學發達之各國，均不之見，而於科學落後之我國，反煌煌耀人眼簾，五光十色之肺癆藥品之多，實難指數，究其實，徒苦一般無醫學常識之病民而已，當其病之初起，本有可治之機會，因不知隔離，及療養之重要，專門乞靈於藥石，一再蹉跎，治病勢嚴重，方行就醫，盡亦晚矣，然藥物對於肺病，果無功效乎，是亦不能</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>一槪而論，大槪經醫師正式指服之藥物，對於病體，大多間接的可增進其抵抗力，但不能直接的能撲撲滅肺癆菌耳。</p>
<p>總之肺癆之於藥物，當時或能見效，惟不能漢滅病菌，根本解决，日後難免復發之　，　夫上海衛生療養院院長密勒博士之言曰，肺癆患者，苟迷信藥石，遠不如樂天安命，接近大自然之爲佳，但余以爲天然療養，自爲療肺之一大助，然以輕病爲限，其有早期空洞者，必先設法除去病穴，再佐以長期療養，方能克奏全功，故患者一方，不可速信藥石，亦不可專恃天然療養，須深具决心、擺脫一切俗務，嚴行休息，受專門之治療，庶變病根可拔，痊愈可期，天賦之健康亦可恢復，（未完）</p>

<p>（七）姙娠確實的診斷</p>
<p>是否有孕的診斷，在最初一二月，是最難確定，我們的有名國醫家，每每憑寸關尺脈案，就可以斷定是否有孕，有些國醫說，五十天的胎，亦可在脈上診斷出來，這話未免太滑稽了，現在我把幾種診斷法詳細寫下希讀者法意。</p>
<p>（甲）確實診斷法</p>
<p>要確實診斷姙娠須經詳細的子宮檢查，或用化學試騐，或觸診及聽胎心聲等。</p>

<p>丁、菌類、烹調用者，如香菌含有些許。</p>
<p>戊、菓類、大部份之鮮菓均含有，惟以橙子，檸檬，香蕉，乾無花果，花生，榛實含之較多。</p>
<p>㈥鹽類</p>
<p>大部份之飮食物均含綠化鹽及其礦鹽等。</p>
<p>㈦水份</p>
<p>凡新鮮飮食物及其烹製者，均含大量之水份，惟乾者或乾製者極少耳。</p>
<p>丑、合宜之營養法</p>
<p>甲、完全之營養飮食物　飮食物中之三種主要質素於每日之營養，用各種飮食物配合之，如用偏於一種質素之飮食物，則缺其二，或二種者缺其一，常有營養不良之弊。</p>
<p>乙、主用植物性食物　吾人之飮食物，日常以動植物者混合而用之依上述者觀之，生活素含於各種植物内至富，然蛋白質及脂肪亦不能或缺，但用小量亦足敷補充，故主用植物者，考之吾東方民族，用以營養，仍屬健全，即可知矣，至於飮食物均以新鮮生活者爲良。</p>
<p>丙、良好之脂肪及油類　動物者以新鮮之乳油、魚肝油，及各種榨出之植物油，如橄欖油，花生油，菜油，茶油，蔴油，荳油，等爲良，爲其激增消化液之分泌，如胃液，膽汁，脺　液等，間接激起腸之嬬動，便自逆順，有增進營養之利，而熱鍊之脂油，則不易消化，用之，當起胃腸之消化不良，凡動植物之脂油，均以鮮製者爲佳，况久藏者，多屬腐敗，或加各種防腐之物，至爲不良。</p>
<p>丁、輸入大量之維他命於體内　因新鮮之植物食品内，含之至富，參看各種飮食物項内，如多用調製者，其中之成份，或完全傷失，或僅存少量，故宜多進生鮮者，如蔬菜，水菓等，再乙種維他命消失最易，應每日用未去麩皮之米麥及他種富含乙種者，方不致缺乏斯種之維他命，而起脚氣病。</p>
<p>戊、每日不必多飮水　每日所進之飮食物内，均含大量之水份，體内已足敷用，如多飮水後，胃中消化液被共滲淡，並積於其内，又使其漲大，致起消化不良及胃擴張等病，夏日及出汗後，則在例外，至於飮水，不易吸收，加以橙子及檸檬汁則較易吸收，而有解渴與清凉之快感。</p>
<p>己、每日之飮食不宜過量　於健全時，依各人之食量，至九分之飽量已足敷身體之需用，過量亦屬浪費，反令胃腸工作過度，使其受傷，全身之各種機能，同時亦工作過勞，以致早年衰老。</p>
<p>庚、進食之時間　除照各地之風俗及各個家庭之習慣外還須注意之事，項如</p>
<p>一　在進食前，宜稍事休息，方能進食。</p>
<p>二、進食時宜改換其環境，暫忘其工作。</p>
<p>三、進食之時間，宜有充分者，以便續嚼，急速呑嚥有傷胃臟。</p>
<p>四、食後亦應休息一小時，方能用腦力及響力之工作，不然，内部之血减少，亦害消化。</p>
<p>寅、應忌之營養食品及嗜好品　　甲　烟草和酒　因當嗜則毒害身體之故。</p>
<p>乙、咖啡茶和茶葉茶　此種茶類亦含響質，當嗜則傷身。</p>
<p>丙、食鹽　吾人調製食物時，用以調其味，常用以刺戟腎臟，有傷腎之虞，並易起膽腎之石症，宜减少感覺不用，然體内亦不致缺少，因大部份之飮食物，均含綠化鹽，輸入已富，故不發生任何危害也。</p>
<p>丁、湯汁之香料及其他之刺戟質素，湯汁，煮肉及鬆脆之食品等均因含有香料及刺戟質素，味極鮮美，能以開胃，久用則傷胃，致起胃口不佳，消化不良等。</p>

<h3 id="c229">怎樣紀念一二八 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 甚</p>
<p>一二八·我懷着一夥熱烈而悲讑的心，在大家嚷着「恭喜發財」的歡聲中，「沉着」的走到街上，因爲我也「愛國不敢後人」的而早已「準備長期抵抗」，所以除了憑「良心救國」而不買劣貨之外，也想看看我們的「愛國志士」是否都和我一樣熱心。也許運氣好，會看得着一點轟轟烈烈的與動吧，但是失望得很，和往日没有異樣，只是許多商店都貼着春聯在「罷市」誌哀。</p>
<p>無已，買了一張當天號外。</p>
<p>在這半張報紙中，我得了許多滿足的敎訓謹抄報紙如下。</p>

<h3 id="c231">都市的防空 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 孟復</p>
<p>「無空防即無國防」這句標語，自去年一二八上海事件發生以後，是很明顯的證實了，試瞑目想一想那翺翔於五千米突高空的轟炸機，携着重至一噸的大型炸彈或成千個猛烈的燃燒彈，和暴風急雨一般襲來，熱鬧的市廛一瞬間即化爲焦土的那種情景，簡直可使人不寒而慄，現在敵機正在熱河山海關一帶猖獗，防空問題實在刻不容援。</p>
<p>所謂「防空」，也可說就是都市的防空，因爲敵人所要破壞的目標，一家是對手國的政治經濟的中心點的大都市，現在且把都市的防空法略述如次··</p>
<p>（Ａ）直接實行的防空法</p>
<p>㈠防空航空隊　此組織爲防空的主體，由戰鬭機組織而成，當敵機來襲擊時，僅以牢守地面的高射砲等對付，難奏全効，所謂「以毒攻毒」，故必須用戰鬭機迎擊，使敵機根本不能通過而至都市，即旣被侵入，亦可以最迅速的手段設法殲滅之，這樣可少受其害，我國因爲根本就没有這種組織和準備，所以蒙害不淺。</p>
<p>㈡高射砲隊及高射機關鎗隊　此兩種組織亦爲防空的主要物，新式的高射砲祇要在六千米突上下，無論如何都爲有効射擊，雖不能完全擊落敵機，至少予敵人以一種恐嚇，使彼空中動作不能隨心所欲，最好在距離都市八千米突的地方憑險設砲位，那不啻爲這都市無形中築一道空中栅欄，高射機關鎗主要目的在直接掩護高射砲陣地以外的建築物，或其他各物，并且二千米突以下的低空射擊非靠牠不可。</p>
<p>㈢阻塞氣球隊　此法在歐戰時德國首先利用，其後英法亦効法，結果甚佳，其目的在使氣球和飛機相撞時，氣球上所有的繩索，纒繞於機身各部，使飛機失其升降力而下墜，雖然直接使飛機下墜甚少，然而至少使飛機在夜間不敢作三千米突上下的低空飛行，所以簡拉的効力却甚大。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）簡接補助的防空</p>
<p>㈠燈火管理制　牠的任務在於熄滅全市的燈火，使敵人失却投彈的目標，所有内屋的燈光，都須嚴密的防好，務使不洩漏到外面。必要的燈光如火車站的紅綠燈，交通要道的路燈，也要遮好，不使燈光上露，不過燈光的熄滅在都市四週的村鐘都要實行的，否則無　明白告訴敵人，黑暗處即目標，所以此制收効雖宏，然而非有嚴密的準備的考量不可。</p>
<p>㈡照空燈和聽音機　防空的航空隊或高射砲隊，如在夜間作戰，那照空燈和聽音機是絶對需要的，照空燈的燭光大率在二十萬萬至三十萬萬，射程大槪十啓羅内外，聽音機可以確定敵機來的販　　　等</p>
<p>方向，然後更用照空燈照射，方始有効，總之兩者要相需爲用，對於夜間作戰，尤其對於高射砲隊，是非常有効的。</p>
<p>㈢防空監視哨　即以氣球浮至離地面約五十啓羅至二百啓羅，派人在上以望遠鏡嚴密監視，如發現遠遠有敵機來襲，即立時報告地面上之防空司令部。</p>
<p>以上所講的防空法大都是須政府的軍部所要負責的，至於市民亦應有一些防空的常識，大略說一點在下面··</p>
<p>㈠消防　都市中房屋鱗次櫛比，因燃燒彈而起火，那是不消說得，消防的重要也可想而知，所以除掉趕快多組織消防隊之外，市民平時應準備着水源的供給，橡皮水管，砂，灰以及各種滅火器，無論星星之火、必須完全弄熄，否則就成爲燎原之勢。</p>
<p>㈡防毒和掃除毒氣，當那殘酷的毒瓦斯炸彈擲下時，非事前有充分的準備不可，市民最好個人備有吸收罐，此吸收罐即毒氣通過此罐後，或被吸收或中和而成爲無毒之氣體，通常以活性炭及曹達石灰等爲之·餘留地面之毒氣，應施以中和劑，或以通風法掃除乾凈·屋内及地下構築物的防毒裝置有二··第一法即完全和外界杜絶，不過須預備養氣之供給，第二法即窗及入口處施以毒瓦斯濾過的裝置，總之防毒是一件非常要</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>緊的事，否則死亡的多是意中事。</p>
<p>㈢掩蔽　掩蔽可在家屋内構築掩蔽部，不過須極堅固，因爲一種破甲彈的擲下，以士敏土的堅固，尙可達到破壞的目的，不過祗要把泥土堆厚終可防備於萬一，最要緊的一點，就是敵機來襲時，不必過事慌張，慌張最易憤事，在家最好躱入預築好的掩蔽部，在外則找凹地隠蔽，這樣至少可免去炸彈飛出的碎片，總之腦筋沉靜一點，或者可以死裏逃生，否則惟有送命而已。</p>
<h3 id="c232">元旦的印象 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 青岑</p>
<p>這裏的元旦，是剛才過去的𤍠鬧的舊歷元旦。雖然舊歷已成廢歷，舊歷年節也已是「廢年」了。但是，因爲數千年來人們對於舊歷｜陰歷｜的根深蒂固的習俗和觀念，所以一般人還是沿用舊歷，因此舊歷年節也還是特别隆重。還有許多人是過了新歷年，還要再過舊歷年，而且對新歷年很淡漠，而對舊歷年却很熱烈。這是幾千年的風俗習慣，在短時期内實在不容易把他轉移的啊。</p>
<p>因爲除夕夜裏，寫了一篇稿子，到早晨三點鐘才睡·，所以一覺醒來，已是十一點鐘了，盥洗後，把屋子裏略略調整一下，又整理了一段稿子，連忙走了出去。到馬路上看鐘，已一點多了，店家都關了門，肚裏很餓，但到那裏去買吃的東西呢。想起節子約我去過年，去吧·，順便在路上找吃食店。就沿着呂班路向北走，冒着那尖利的朔風。天氣陰寒逼人。醒來時還看見很好的太陽，竟很快地變了如此陰沉而嚴寒的天氣。我在凛厲的怒嘯的冷風中鼓勇前進，從呂班路向戈登路。</p>
<p>元旦的馬路上，却異樣的冷落凄清，大槪是天氣太陰寒了，人家都躱在家裏尋樂，或者鑽進戲院遊藝塲去，有誰在馬路上玩狂呢。人家商店都關了門，但從墻垣和板壁可以聽到裏面的麻雀聲，牌九聲，或者是呼么喝六的呌囂聲。我走過的馬路上，鏻次櫛比的店面人家，幾乎没有一家没有賭博的聲音。我想，在這裏，賭博的實際作用，大部分都變成娛樂的了。誰不要遊戲？誰不要消遣？而在一般的中國社會，可以供遊戲和消遣的，唯一的最方便的就是賭博了。無論甚麽地方都有各色各種和賭具，而且賭博又是含有競爭性的有趣的遊戲。所以在新年，賭博是一般最有興趣的遊戲和消遣。</p>
<p>兒童們都穿了各種顔色的花花的新衣，圍在馬路旁的吃食搪，玩具攤。有許多孩子在率花炮，小小的花炮一經用力　到地上，就「轟」的炸響了。孩子們是最快活的，尤其在這樣隆盛熱鬧而享樂的新年。</p>
<p>在街角巷尾，比平常覺得更多了許多殘廢的老弱的，各有足以使人憐憫的形體的乞丐，在等着新年的享樂的人們討乞。</p>
<p>經過福煦路，成都路，走到卡德路了。還没有找到一個地方吃東西，肚子餓的在呌，終於在卡德路找尋到一家湯團店，吃了四個熱的湯團，聊果饑餓之腹。吃了湯團，覺得身上增加了不少的熱力，繼續向寒風中衝進。</p>
<p>在戈登路的飄飛的雪花中前進。遠遠地聽到前面一陣一陣的「殺，殺···」的</p>
<p>暴烈聲音，因爲過去做過「丘八學生」的經騐，知道大槪是軍隊在演習劈剌。走近了去，到「株式會社」的内外紗廠的門口，看見裏面院子裏，有一隊日本兵，日本的陸戰隊，穿了護身器甲，持了上了剌刀的槍，在演習劈剌，就是在演習衝鋒殺人的白刃戰。這情景，中國人見了心裏總消受不了，何况我是一個青年呢！我在想，今天是元旦，中國人正忙着過年，忙着享樂，在醉生萝死中過日子·，而日本軍隊於嚴寒飛雪中，在中國的土地上演習劈剌，演習殺人，預備殺中國人啊！啊啊，醉生夢死的中國人啊！還不覺醒起來嗎？敵人正在我們的面前作剌殺我們的演習啊！</p>
<p>我的心兒跳着，血在奔騰，我揑緊了拳頭，拚着氣繼續前進，走我的路。··········</p>

<p>『你也來拿我開心！』若華用她的俏目向仲南一瞪，閃電般的視線，一瞬間已由仲南臉上轉到幼中的眼中，嬌嗔變作嬌羞，嫣然一笑，急忙低頭。</p>
<p>『爹爹！』黛秋一手拿着一支雪茄送到仲南嘴裏，一手拿着一盒洋火，替他擦火，燃着了。</p>

<p>International: The League of Nations' Nine-Power Committee carefully drafts a report. The French political situation is chaotic. Hitler is about to become German Chancellor. Shanghai: The China Aviation Association solicits member declarations by telegram. Various circles send four telegrams after the 18th anniversary. The Shanghai County Government completes its relocation.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The League of Nations Subcommittee Carefully Drafts a Concluding Report <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The third and fourth sections still await detailed consideration today.</p>
<p>The recommendation section will be based on the Lytton Report's ten principles.</p>
<p>Great importance is attached to the wording of the anti-Japanese goods issue.</p>
<p>The Far East policies of France and Germany will not be affected by the political turmoil.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The nine-member drafting committee has completed the first two sections of the report and part of the third section. The third section reaffirms that the three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory and that China is not responsible for the September 18th Incident. Whether the Chinese boycott movement is legal and whether Japan's so-called self-defense actions were proactive or reactive are still to be considered in detail next Monday. The nature of this report is to formally express the League of Nations' own position, which is very different from mediation that requires the consent of both parties. Therefore, the report is based primarily on the Lytton Report and the League of Nations Secretariat's draft, supplemented by drafts from Sweden and other countries. The most difficult part to write, the recommendation section, may also be based on the ten principles in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report. (Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The nine-member subcommittee is unlikely to hold any meetings before Monday or Tuesday. In the meantime, the Secretariat will prepare a new draft based on yesterday's discussions and include various detailed amendments. This report is quite lengthy, about fifty or sixty pages typed, with the Lytton Report as an appendix. The draft will be carefully considered word by word, so the subcommittee's work is very difficult. According to those responsible, the discussions are proceeding smoothly, and no major objections have been encountered so far. How the subcommittee's conclusions should be drafted is a matter that must be treated with extreme caution, as it concerns several principles that are even more important than the issues that will arise in the Sino-Japanese dispute. For example, the issue of boycotting Japanese goods is one such issue that is extremely difficult to write about. The potential of this issue is, of course, very significant, so the subcommittee is currently giving the utmost care to the wording of this point. However, this is not to say that there are differences of opinion within the subcommittee; it is merely a matter of deliberating on appropriate wording. The difficulty of this is generally recognized, but the Secretariat is good at this. The date of the next meeting of the Committee of Nineteen has not yet been determined. It is expected that it will be convened around Wednesday or Thursday. At that time, the draft report will inevitably be added to or deleted from again. Judging from the appearance, the subcommittee will also draft another draft as the basis for the final section of the report, the recommendation. The general atmosphere is more optimistic than before, feeling that real progress is now being made, and the direction in which it is being made will maintain the principles of the League of Nations in a clear and unmistakable manner, which even Japan will find difficult to oppose. What kind of reaction the Far East will have is, of course, impossible to predict at present. Representatives from both China and Japan are closely watching developments without saying a word. Telegrams from Tokyo have indicated the position of the Seiyukai's attitude. It is expected that there will be no major developments in Tokyo for the time being. If the French cabinet's political turmoil is not prolonged, it will inevitably affect the progress of the League of Nations' discussions, as France will still be represented by Massigli. However, any important decisions on principles will have to be postponed for the time being. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The political turmoil in France and Germany will delay various issues that need to be resolved in Geneva, especially those concerning principles that need to be decided publicly. The drafting committee can, of course, continue to work as usual, and the Committee of Nineteen can also continue to meet. However, until the political turmoil is over, the League of Nations General Assembly will not be able to convene, and the meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, originally scheduled for February 2nd, will also be postponed. It is expected that although there will be changes in the French and German cabinets, their general policy in Geneva will not change with them. If the new French government belongs to the extreme left wing, its attitude towards the Far East and disarmament may change greatly, but judging from the current situation, this kind of change may not be realized. Germany also has a tendency to lean towards the right wing, which also seems unlikely to change its attitude towards the Far Eastern question. However, its attitude of demanding equality on other matters may become stronger. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The nine-member drafting committee is now entirely under British control. British Foreign Secretary Simon is doing his best to favor Japan, opposing the declaration in the report that it does not recognize the puppet organization, disregarding the firm opinions of various small countries. As for our country's repeated requests to clearly announce that Japan has violated the covenant, it is even more difficult to expect to achieve. As a result of several informal contacts between Britain and Japan, Britain has assured Japan that it will never invoke Article 16 of the Covenant in the future. The saying that there was an understanding between Britain and Japan when the Japanese army withdrew from Shanghai last year is now further proven. (Central News Agency, 29th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation held an important meeting on the 28th, morning and afternoon, and adjourned at 7:30 p.m., and immediately telegraphed to the government for instructions, the content of which is as follows: 1. A report on the attitude of the drafting committee and various countries to date, and a general overview of the latest situation. 2. If Japan wants to continue negotiations with the League of Nations under these circumstances, as stipulated in Article 15, Paragraph 3, to what extent should it agree with the League of Nations' views? 3. The delegation plans to do its best to the final step. When the fourth report is submitted to the General Assembly, what procedures should the delegation take? 4. If the content of the recommendation in the report cannot be accepted by Japan, should the Japanese representatives not only leave Geneva but also withdraw from the League of Nations? 5. The text of the telegram is unclear. (Japan United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the content of the draft report currently being drafted by the Committee of Nine, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is avoiding making a formal statement of its attitude because it has not received an official telegram. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an unofficial statement on the 28th, stating that regardless of whether the content of the report is in the introduction, conclusion, or historical description, if it adopts the same views as the Lytton Report, Japan will never accept it. In particular, it includes four points: denying the status quo of "Manchukuo," denying the natural occurrence of "Manchukuo," questioning the legitimacy of the Japanese army's self-defense rights, and justifying economic sanctions, which Japan cannot ignore. If the League of Nations insists on producing such a recommendation and submitting it to Japan, the Japanese government will immediately send a rebuttal to thoroughly criticize the League of Nations' fallacies and resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e9">As Japan Threatens to Withdraw from the League of Nations, Internal Contradictions Intensify <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Elderly figures in the political world are deeply afraid of diplomatic isolation.</p>
<p>The warlords are determined to go their own way with a bellicose determination.</p>
<p>One side says it will not give up its mandate over the islands.</p>
<p>The other side declares that there are no military arrangements.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army have repeatedly exaggerated the threat of withdrawing from the League of Nations to intimidate the world, but in reality, internal opinions are still divided. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the elders of the political world are strongly opposed to isolated diplomacy. Although they have been forced by the general trend to a situation where they have to withdraw from the League of Nations because of excessive intimidation, the Japanese government is still unwilling to break with the League of Nations completely. There are two reasons: 1. It fears that the South Pacific Islands will be taken back by the League of Nations, losing its powerful base for operations against the United States. If the issue of the South Pacific Islands' governance comes into direct conflict with the League of Nations, Japan's position will be even more unfavorable, and its situation will inevitably progress from being anti-American to opposing the entire world. 2. Completely withdrawing from the League of Nations will put it in an isolated position in world opinion. If a world war is triggered by the Manchurian issue, Japan must bear full responsibility. The failure of the Disarmament Conference will promote a global arms race, and Japan's position will be even more difficult in a financially bankrupt country. For the above reasons, the Navy and the elders of the political world mostly advocate prudent action. Even when the time comes to withdraw from the League of Nations, they should adopt a policy of neither being too close nor too far. However, the bellicose Japanese Army still insists on breaking with the League of Nations, and the disarmament representatives must return to their country at the same time. As the future of the League of Nations becomes increasingly clear, internal contradictions in Japan are becoming increasingly acute. The recent disputes in the Japanese political world have focused on the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations. (China United News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army has been patiently watching the progress of the Sino-Japanese issue in the League of Nations, but the committee members of small countries who do not understand the situation in the Far East still focus on the positions of their own countries, continue to hold attitudes unfavorable to Japan from a deliberate point of view, and in view of the current situation of the Committee of Nineteen, they are also controlled by various small countries, so they have resolutely given up hope for the League of Nations. Therefore, it seems that a secret telegram has been sent to the military plenipotentiaries in Geneva, instructing them to prepare to withdraw and to always advance according to the established policy, and to be wary of unfavorable words. The military has shown the greatest magnanimity and has worked hard to clear up the League of Nations' misunderstandings. If the League of Nations does not realize its mistakes, then there is no need to pay attention to applying Article 15, Paragraph 4 or Article 26 of the Covenant, and the measures that the League of Nations should take, such as 1. economic blockade against Japan, 2. military pressure against Japan, 3. dissolution of the mandate over the two oceans, etc., one of which is that there may be some changes in public debt exchange, but there is no fear of collapse in the trading market; the second is for the sake of justice, even if Japan is turned into scorched earth, it will not hesitate, so the state of affairs today is absolutely devoid of the possibility of war; as for the third, there is no reason to give up dominion over the South Pacific, of course, it will leave the League of Nations and become independent, and so on, which is said to be the opinion of the Empire. (Electric Communications News, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy Minister Osumi clarified to the press today his remarks in Parliament on January 23 regarding the naval program, saying that the details of the entire second naval supplementary program have not yet been decided. However, one part of it, which is now being submitted for approval, only involves the construction of one submarine tender and two submarine chasers, totaling 15 million yen. As for the naval air force, there is no increase other than the program determined after the London Conference. The Navy Minister also firmly denied the claim that Japan had built submarine bases and airfields on the mandated islands in the Pacific Ocean, saying that it was only building harbors on the islands for commercial use and that the Navy Ministry had nothing to do with this work. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic editor of the British Daily Telegraph declared that a spokesman for the Japanese government had declared that Japan was unwilling to give up its mandated Pacific Islands (i.e., the Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands, and Marshall Islands), even if the League of Nations revoked its mandate. The spokesman also said that the islands were "spoils of war." The diplomatic editor of the newspaper said that this claim by Japan would raise very interesting legal questions. The original grant of the mandate was not due to the League of Nations, but to the "Allied Supreme Council," which distributed it to the Allied countries, and then it was retroactively recognized by the League of Nations. A few years ago, British Colonial Secretary Amery made a declaration in Geneva, putting forward the principle of mandates, saying that the League of Nations could not revoke the mandate over the land conquered by the Allied countries and which it had always retained under the agreement between the Allied countries. In addition, if the mandated country is not a member of the League of Nations, it will be difficult to make it always abide by the provisions belonging to the mandate except to continue to cooperate with the Executive Council of the League of Nations and the Permanent Mandates Commission. If these provisions are not observed, then the behavior of the mandated country will amount to annexing the mandated land, but the treaty countries do not recognize the right to annex. The News Chronicle also discussed the same issue, saying that it is a waste of time to try to compromise with a country whose words and actions are such. It concluded that the League of Nations should speak out immediately and unconditionally accept and support the Lytton Report. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>=Japanese Army and Air Force Launch Large-Scale Invasion of Kailu=</p>
<p>=Three Fierce Attacks Repelled by Our Army=</p>
<p>⊙Chengde: Tang Yulin issued a circular telegram saying that all newspapers have noted with sadness that since the September 18th Incident, the three provinces have fallen one after another, and Rehe is the first to bear the brunt. A strong enemy is pressing on the border, and news from the border is becoming increasingly urgent. At first, they invaded Beipiao and bombed Chaoyang. Fortunately, our army and soldiers used their lives and gave them a head-on blow, and the enemy did not succeed. Then, they changed their plans and invaded Lingkai in separate ways. The enemy who entered Lingnan was blocked and retreated by the people, so they gathered their forces and launched a general offensive towards Kailu. In the space of ten days, enemy aircraft bombed every day. Although the army stationed in Kai was quite calm after the ashes, they endured the pain and held on to their deaths, and their morale was high. Then the enemy suddenly on Youyou and Liang days, with cavalry and Mongols as the vanguard, combined infantry, cavalry, artillery, aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles, etc., in a joint land and air operation, made a large-scale attempt to attack Kai. Three fierce attacks were all bravely resisted by our cavalry brigade commander Cui, fighting fiercely all day long. Finally, spirit prevailed over weapons, killing seven or eight Japanese soldiers and more than thirty Mongol soldiers. The enemy could not support and retreated. Our army also suffered considerable losses. It has been found that the Japanese have long been determined to attack Rehe. This attack on Kai has already begun. Yulin has a responsibility to defend the territory and will carry out the anti-Japanese and national salvation cause from beginning to end. In addition to supervising the troops to prepare for defense, I also hope that people across the country will provide guidance on military opportunities, rise up to help, strengthen the soldiers' determination to resist Japan, and protect the gateway to North China and Tianjin. The Chinese people's hearts are not dead, and the Northeast land will not be lost. I dare to report my sincerity and wait for clear instructions. Army Commander Tang Yulin of the Rehe Garrison, [stamps]. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Founding of the Chinese Education Association in Guangzhou <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Recently, educational figures from various regions, recognizing that our nation's education is nearing bankruptcy and urgently needing a way to salvage it, have organized the Chinese Education Association with the aim of researching and reforming education. Starting from the 28th (January 28th Incident) , they gathered representatives from various locations and held an inaugural meeting at the Shanghai YMCA. At the same time, they separately studied important issues related to education at all levels, such as "The Current Educational Policy of China," "What Mission Should University Education in China Undertake Today," and "What Are the Most Urgent Points for Improvement in Secondary Education in China Today?" On the memorial day of the January 28th Incident, the most painful national crisis of blood and tears, the establishment of this most meaningful academic association leads us to recognize that the birth of this association carries the greatest of missions.</p>
<p>In recent years, internal strife and external aggression have been mutually pressing, and the national situation is precarious and cannot last. Throughout the country, those who worry about the times are only anxious and those who are passive are only waiting for death. Others who procrastinate and live for the moment, like swallows nesting in a curtain unaware of the danger, are even more common. With a vast territory, a large population, and a nation with a 5,000-year history, it has come to the point where it cannot control internal strife, cannot resist external aggression, and the whole country is fearful, waiting for death. From this phenomenon, we can say that our country's education today has completely failed without exaggeration.</p>
<p>Our country's two major current problems today are internal strife and external aggression. How does internal strife arise? In a word, it is due to the masses having no food to eat. Only when the masses are hungry and unable to secure their livelihoods does chaos arise. Furthermore, because internal strife follows its course, external aggression can take advantage of the opportunity to enter. If we want to stabilize the lives of our people today and resist foreign aggression, the fundamental problem lies in improving politics and the economy. However, reforming education, making it suitable for current needs, and enabling it to truly fulfill its mission are also among the most important aspects.</p>
<p>So, what is the mission of current education? We believe that first, it should be productive, and second, it should be upward-looking.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? Past education, if not deliberately embellished, cannot help but be admitted to have been aimless and without direction. Once young people enter school, they become a special class, their lives becoming increasingly extravagant, their desires increasingly elevated. The superiority of their lives is almost ten times or even a hundred times that of the toiling masses. Education cannot solve its own problems or those around it; instead, it pulls young people out of society, isolating them from society and from the masses. There is empty talk of doctrines and empty theories, such as Americanization or Europeanization, without regard to the actual situation in our country. As a result, scholars have no purpose and, after graduation, are incapable and useless. Education cannot integrate with society, nor can it guide young people onto the path of production and construction; instead, it creates vagrants for society. As a result, the more education there is, the poorer the country becomes, and the more chaotic the social order becomes. Education merely sows evil causes and chronic diseases, and it is no coincidence that we are reaping the fruits of this today. Therefore, in the future, we must determine that the mission of education is production, construction, and creation. It should enable every young person to develop their intelligence and talent, receive sufficient political training, integrate with society, be able to endure hardship, and possess the spirit of creating a new era and a new society. This is the first point.</p>
<p>What is meant by the "upward-looking" mission of education in the future? We believe that the reason why a nation can survive in the world is that it has "national self-confidence." Only with national self-confidence can it fight, resist aggression, and maintain the survival of its nation. Our nation has a long history of 5,000 years, yet it has declined to the point where it is like meat on a chopping board, waiting to be slaughtered. It must be said that our national self-confidence has been worn away. Therefore, the mission of education in the future should also be to enhance the upward mobility of our nation and restore its self-confidence, so that our nation can use this self-confidence to strive for freedom of survival and independence. This is another point.</p>
<p>In summary, as of today, the national pulse and the people's lives are hanging by a thread. In this extraordinary period, extraordinary education should be vigorously implemented. All facilities today should be re-evaluated for their purpose and meaning, and everything should start anew. Education is especially one of the most important aspects. The Chinese Education Association has now been established. We earnestly hope that this association can grasp the current needs of our nation and, with a spirit of practice, shoulder the heavy responsibility of improving education and rebuilding the foundation of the nation.</p>

However, given the trends of the environment, it will not hesitate to occupy various key points by force and drive the Chinese army to western Rehe, etc. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Departure scheduled for late this month</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Shengda, Secretary-General of Su Bingwen, wired from Vorms, Russia, on the 23rd, stating that Su and Ma are currently preparing the procedures for going to Europe. The departure is scheduled for around the end of the month. Su's purpose for going to Europe is threefold: 1. To study the military affairs of various countries; 2. To investigate the attitudes of various governments and peoples towards the Far Eastern issue; 3. To announce Japan's conspiracies and atrocities to the League of Nations and the governments and peoples of various countries. He will definitely go to Geneva in the future. On the 21st, Su gave a speech to the soldiers, briefly stating that the current Japan is like Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany during World War I, who declared that war was irrational. After this declaration, it caused countries with different interests to be drawn into the whirlpool. Therefore, today's public law treaties cannot stop the tyrannical Japanese acts of aggression. He also said that China should adopt an attitude of "neither relying on nor being estranged from" the League of Nations, because China is a weak country and the League of Nations is a machinery for imperialist powers to divide the spoils. If China goes against it, various imperialist powers will take actively unfavorable actions against China; if China relies on it, there will be passively unfavorable consequences for China. Finally, he said that if China wants to effectively stop the aggression of tyrannical Japan, there is no other way but to wage war against Japan with well-trained soldiers and advanced weaponry.

<p>⊙Osaka The maritime Communist Party, which has been secretly and continuously active in connecting the United States, China, and Japan, has recently had its organization discovered. Yesterday, Consul General Wakasugi in San Francisco wired the Osaka Prefectural Foreign Affairs Section to arrest them. The beginning of this discovery was due to a certain Japanese youth who was a member of the Communist Party in San Francisco being targeted by a comrade. As a result of internal investigation, it was revealed that the important figures were a stoker on the Chichibu Maru and a stoker on the Bombay Maru, who were trying to hypnotize lower-level crew members in the United States, China, and Japan.

<p>⊙Cleveland Peck, a key figure in the Democratic Party, gave a public lecture at Cleveland University today on the Far Eastern situation. He was quite frank, believing that the current Far East is full of crises and could erupt at any moment. Once it erupts, it will plunge the rest of the world into war. Today, the conflict of interests in the Far East from all sides is also likely to become the trigger for the outbreak. Japan's current territory is not enough to feed its current population, let alone supply the rapidly increasing population in the future. There is very little iron produced in Japan, and virtually no coal or gold is produced. Manchuria is a treasure trove for supplying these raw materials. Therefore, Japan will inevitably use its own survival as an excuse to oppose the growth of Soviet power in China. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, wants to make China a Soviet republic. If Japan allows the Soviet Union to succeed, it will become an unemployed country, industry will decline, and its life will be completely dependent on Russia. Therefore, the Japanese feel that another war with Russia is inevitable. According to reports, Peck has been rumored to be a potential candidate for Secretary of State. After giving this speech, his friends believe that Peck will not necessarily take on the role of Secretary of State in the next term, otherwise, he would not have made such blunt remarks.

This action clearly undermines the spirit of the rule of law and the supervisory system.

<p>Protesting Japan's Forced Occupation of the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>Clash with Steel-Helmeted Police</p>
<p>⊙Chicago: Today, 600 communists surrounded the Japanese Consulate here, protesting Japan's occupation of Manchuria, and clashed for a long time with 200 steel-helmeted police sent by the authorities to suppress them, causing traffic in the city center to be blocked for more than an hour. 184 demonstrators were arrested, including 22 women, such as Remisen, a member of the National Unemployed Committee, and Ms. Nongtai'er, a former teacher at the city's municipal school. When the demonstrators held banners with the words "Get out of China" and crowded into the circular area, the police, knowing the seriousness of the situation, urgently issued a riot alarm. The authorities immediately sent a reserve team and 25 mounted patrols, a total of about 200 people, to suppress them. At that time, the number of demonstrators had increased to 400, and they threw three packs of red pepper powder at the police. However, most of the pepper powder blew back into the eyes of the demonstrators, causing more than 5,000 people to be temporarily blinded. Afterwards, another 200 demonstrators rushed out from the small roads on both sides, and the conflict area expanded. They advanced and retreated around the Chicago Tribune Building Tower. When the fighting between the two sides was fierce, the Japanese Consul Mutō once peered out in front of the office, but the demonstrators were busy resisting the police and did not notice. In the end, the police surrounded the demonstrators and drove them across the canal bridge to Lake Street, where there were fewer vehicles, making it easier for the police to cope, and then dispersed the rioters. Throughout the entire incident, the rioters never attempted to enter the Chicago Tribune. Their sole purpose was clearly to oppose Japan's occupation of Manchuria. It was reported that nearly 100 anti-Japanese banners were seized afterwards. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Hitler Appointed German Chancellor, Papen Appointed Vice-Chancellor with Real Power <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 29th: According to the opinions of many politicians, President Hindenburg's solution to the political crisis is to make Hitler a puppet chancellor and Papen vice-chancellor, but with real power. The powers of the vice-chancellor will be expanded, and no administrative plan can be established without his approval. President Hindenburg is unwilling to allow Reichstag President Göring to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th: Schleicher has submitted his resignation to President Hindenburg today, and the president has accepted it and asked former Chancellor Papen to inquire from various political parties and report on whether a new government can be formed based on a broad parliamentary foundation. It is reported that President Hindenburg asked Schleicher to attend the Reichstag and present his policies to await development. Schleicher was unwilling to comply with this request and asked the president to discuss the political situation with his colleagues. The result was that the cabinet decided to resign. The Schleicher cabinet was the twentieth cabinet since the establishment of the German Republic. Schleicher was in office for only 65 days. Many newspapers expressed their opinions, saying that Schleicher previously attacked Papen behind the scenes, forcing President Hindenburg to reluctantly abandon his friend. The president seems to have not forgotten this matter. Also, the fall of the Brüning cabinet was also the responsibility of Schleicher. What Schleicher did to others in the past is now being repaid to him, so he could not keep his position.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Very Difficult for Various Parties to Unite <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 28th: The German political situation is still in extreme chaos today, and there is no hope of clarification or stabilization within the next few days. Since the Schleicher cabinet resigned at 1:00 PM today and the president appointed former Chancellor Papen to investigate the possibility of forming a parliamentary cabinet, the only real development is the decision of the Reichstag Standing Committee to adjourn the Reichstag indefinitely, probably until a new government is formed. However, all parties in the political circles are very skeptical about whether President Hindenburg's imagined parliamentary government, or a cabinet based on the open support of a large majority in the Reichstag, can be realized. Because if the various right-wing parties want to unite, they must first reconcile the old enmities between Hugenberg and Hitler, which is already extremely difficult. And even if the various right-wing parties can unite, they cannot reach a majority in the Reichstag. Therefore, they must also try to win over the Catholic Center Party, which is deeply hated by the National Socialist and German National People's Parties. Therefore, not only is it impossible for the National Socialist and German National People's Parties to accommodate the Center Party, but even the Center Party's hope of supporting Papen's cabinet is absolutely渺茫, because Papen used to belong to the Center Party, but later, due to power relations, he attempted to split the internal part of the party, so he is suspected of betraying the party.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Center Party Plays a Decisive Role <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th: Supporters of the Republic in Germany are panicked because of the failure of the Schleicher cabinet and the appearance of former Chancellor Papen trying to organize a new cabinet with the powers of a dictator. President Hindenburg instructed Schleicher to present the president's policies to the Reichstag, but Schleicher was unwilling to do so, so he submitted his resignation. Supporters of the Republic believe that Papen's reappointment is a challenging move to the Republic. Hundreds of telegrams have been sent to the president opposing the reinstatement of Papen as chancellor. The most powerful of these comes from the National Trade Union, which asks the president to resolve the political situation in accordance with the constitution and asks the president to meet with representatives of the trade union. Judging from the phenomenon, either Papen or Hitler will be the next chancellor, but the president has instructed Papen to inquire about the opinions of various political parties, in order to know the possibility of the future. Papen has not yet received the order to form a cabinet. The discussions between the National Socialist Party and the German National People's Party have not yet reached a point where both sides can reach a compromise, and the Center Party is standing by. It is allowed that the Center Party has a decisive influence on the organization of the government based on the constitution, so Papen will first devote himself to seeking the assistance of the Center Party.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 29th: Yesterday afternoon, former German Chancellor Papen contacted the leaders of various right-wing parties and the leaders of the Center Party and the Bavarian People's Party until late at night. He resumed negotiations this morning, but so far no concrete results have been heard. As for the various political parties and the general public, they are panicked and have several alarms a night. Last night, the Communist Party distributed leaflets instructing workers to prepare for a general strike and convened sales staff from various factories in Berlin to discuss the situation on Monday. The police then ordered the Communist Party to prohibit various outdoor demonstrations planned for today. However, the capital is still calm and there is no serious unrest in the country.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 28th: It is heard that outgoing Chancellor Schleicher advised President Hindenburg to solve the political crisis by having Hitler organize a parliamentary government and cautioned the president against any government hanging the false name of the president's office, which in reality only benefits one party. This will be criticized by the majority of the country.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 29th: Today, French newspapers published the news of the resignation of the German cabinet in a prominent position, mostly believing that it was a sign that the right wing would win in German domestic politics. As for the diplomatic aspect, it seems that there is no need to pay too much attention.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Rome, 29th: The Italian newspapers were very surprised by the resignation of the Schleicher cabinet in Germany, because the Italian people believed that the position of the French cabinet was far more solid than it actually was.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Vienna, 29th: The Austrian capital expressed regret upon hearing the news of the resignation of German Chancellor Schleicher, because the Austrian political circles have always admired and sympathized with Schleicher.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Future of the French Political Crisis Is Difficult, President-Style Consultation on Prime Ministerial Candidates <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 28th: French President Lebrun continued to consult with party leaders this morning and afternoon in order to resolve the political crisis. The president also convened financial leaders from both houses of parliament for a meeting, which shows that the president is well aware that the crux of the current political crisis also lies in the financial aspect. It is difficult to predict when the current political crisis will end. There are calls for the left-wing radicals Taladier and Senate Speaker Jeannency to be appointed as prime minister.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 28th: This morning, after the cabinet members left the presidential palace, President Lebrun left Pangue alone in the palace to discuss for a quarter of an hour in order to arrange the approval of the appropriation bill on January 31, because the national treasury is currently empty. It is heard that this move can be done constitutionally, even if the new cabinet is not established by the end of this month, the Senate and the House of Representatives can also accomplish this necessary procedure.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Various Opinions Are Very Divided <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 28th: How did all parties feel on the first day of the political crisis? There is no indication. All parties unanimously believe that although the Pangue cabinet has been overthrown, the difficulties of the situation have not been reduced. Whoever takes over as prime minister will face difficulties in the House of Representatives, and the situation will be the same as what Pangue experienced. As for the senators, they have fewer concerns about the voters, so they are not as strict with the government as the House of Representatives. Although the split between the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party is not irreparable, the feelings between them are not very harmonious. It will take various tricks to reconcile them. In the House of Representatives' lounge, the general opinion is that Interior Minister Xu Dang and former Army Minister Taladier have some hope of organizing a new cabinet. As for the idea of not organizing a new cabinet exclusively with representatives of the left wing, most believe that it is impossible, unless the Socialist Party refuses to cooperate with the national coalition cabinet or the all-party concentration cabinet, then it is another matter. In the Senate lounge, there were many discussions, and the senators all held a reserved attitude, but some also said that Xu Dang and Daladier had hope of forming a cabinet. Most senators believe that if the government wants to take resolute measures on political affairs, it must be organized by all parties in concentration, but they said that it is not yet time to organize a concentrated cabinet. When Socialist Party leader Blum left the presidential palace, he told people that the Socialist Party still believed that the position of the majority party in the parliament should not change direction, and that the current political crisis would not affect the party's主張.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 28th: The National Union of Taxpayers, with 700,000 members, convened a grand meeting this afternoon to resist tax increases. The meeting place was already overcrowded, and people outside the door were still crowding to enter the meeting place. About a thousand people who were dispersed by the police. After the meeting, some people planned to form a team to demonstrate towards the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Presidential Palace, but they were eventually dispersed by the police. A conflict occurred between the two sides, and several people were arrested and immediately released. A resolution was unanimously passed at the meeting, requiring ㈠ immediate reduction of the state's useless spending, ㈡ improvement of administration, ㈢ abandonment of the state's overly cumbersome duties, ㈣ reduction of excessive tax rates, and ㈤ creation of bonds to clarify finances in order to restore financial balance, and requesting the President to establish a detached government to govern the country, so as not to be affected by party factions.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Disarmament Conference Affected <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Geneva, 28th: The French political crisis has the danger of making the disarmament conference issues more complicated. The general opinion here is to hope that the French cabinet crisis will be resolved quickly, so that major international issues will not be delayed too much. The Disarmament Conference has organized a committee to study the issue of private manufacturing of armaments within the domestic scope of various countries. This committee was originally scheduled to meet today, chaired by French representative and Vice Minister Gutt. Now, due to the overthrow of the French cabinet, the situation has changed, and it is feared that the UK's proposal on the future working methods of disarmament will be difficult to put forward for discussion. French people at the Disarmament Conference have a very good impression of this proposal, while Germans are very disappointed. The German delegation believes that the British proposal is only intended to seek a mediation method between the Hoover-Simon and French proposals, as well as the Disarmament Conference resolution in December last year. From the point of view of the quality of armaments, Germany firmly demands the principle of equality of armaments and implements it immediately, and the armaments that Germany cannot retain should also be destroyed by other countries. As for the quantity of armaments, Hoover once requested a reduction of two-thirds, while Germany believes that it should implement the "relative" principle according to that country's interpretation of Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Taladier's Call Is Very High <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 29th: President Lebrun resumed consultations on cabinet formation at 9:15 this morning, meeting with the leaders of the major party groups in the Senate and the House of Representatives. According to the opinions expressed by the consulted dignitaries, the political situation does not seem to have been clarified. House of Representatives Republican Left Party President Bertier and People's Democratic Party President Simon both said that the Radical Socialist Party cabinet, with Xu Dang who is preparing to concentrate the government as prime minister, is currently impossible. As a result, representatives of various political parties mediating between the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party advocate organizing Taladier as prime minister, and Congress Radical Socialist Party President Taladier as prime minister. The Senate side also proposed Senate Speaker Yenaman, because Yenaman's speech on January 16 made a very good impression.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 29th: Last night, political circles rumored that President Lebrun intended to order Senate Speaker Yenaman to organize a cabinet. According to Yenaman's speech on January 16, he strongly advocated that France should be vigilant on its own in order to avoid the continued extension of the previous situation. However, some people said that Yenaman would rather retain the position of Senate Speaker in order to continue to fulfill his task of adjusting the deliberative body in the Senate. Therefore, President Lebrun seems to be planning to change his request to Congress Radical Socialist Party President Taladier to come forward and form a cabinet. Taladier seems to be planning to propose to the Socialist Party to participate in the cabinet based on a definite political program, but it is very doubtful whether the Socialist Party can accept it. Therefore, Taladier may come forward to organize a cabinet based on a similar political foundation to the previous Herriot cabinet. In this cabinet, the voice of former Minister of Public Works Peng Lai is the highest for the seat of Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>British Ambassador Meets with Roosevelt</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Hot Springs, 28th – President-elect Roosevelt, hearing that the British government had recalled its ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, to discuss the war debt situation, immediately asked Secretary of State Stimson to invite Lindsay to meet him in Hot Springs. Lindsay departed from Washington today, flying to Atlanta and then driving here. He will meet with Roosevelt tomorrow to discuss the entire war debt issue. It is understood that Roosevelt will outline his principles for resolving the war debts, and it is expected that this matter will be closer to resolution after this discussion. It is also understood that Lindsay will only stay here for a few hours, as he will be sailing back to England on Tuesday. It is said that after returning to England, he will assist the government in deciding on the British representative.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 29th – British Ambassador Lindsay arrived in Hot Springs late at night. Before departing by plane, he told guests that he was very hopeful about the outcome of the trip. The New York Sun's Hot Springs dispatch stated that Roosevelt had convened his economic advisors and would explain to Ambassador Lindsay the principles and plans for modifying or reducing Britain's war debt to the United States, as well as the plan to restore global economic equilibrium.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Southern Ireland Election Results <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>De Valera's Party Wins Majority</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 29th – The final results of the general election in the Irish Free State were announced early this morning. The number of seats won by each party is as follows:</p>
<p>Fianna Fáil: 77</p>
<p>Cumann na nGaedheal: 48</p>
<p>Independents: 8</p>
<p>Labour Party: 8</p>
<p>Centre Party: 1</p>
<p>Independent Labour Party: 1</p>
<p>Last night at 8 pm, De Valera told a Reuters reporter that the election results were inevitable. He also said that he expected the number of Irish people who supported independence and appropriate self-sufficiency would continue to increase. It should be understood that Ireland had been fighting for independence for 700 years, but this did not mean hostility towards Britain. Regarding the Northern Irish Prime Minister's statement that Northern Irish patriots were firmly prepared to defeat the plan to merge Northern and Southern Ireland into a republic, De Valera said that anyone who thought he could prevent the development of national trends was simply foolish. If a genuine and lasting peace was to be established between Ireland and Britain, the unification of Ireland was a necessary prerequisite, but any suggestions to the six counties of Northern Ireland should only be made when people's minds had changed somewhat.</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Collapse of the Chinese Communist Party <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>｜A Personal Account by Zhu Yizhi After Leaving the Communist Party｜</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Yizhi, who recently left the Communist Party, gave a very detailed account of "The Collapse of the Chinese Communist Party." It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1. I was originally a loyal believer in the Communist Party. I have been in the Communist Party for seven years. Now I am standing on the front line against communism.</p>
<p>My political transformation this time came after a day and night of contemplation. This day and night was a chasm in my life. Before this day and night, I was a supporter of communism, a loyal believer in the Communist Party. After this day and night, I became the bravest anti-communist pioneer.</p>
<p>Although a day and night is only twenty-four hours, a very short time, within this short time, I was like two different people. However, this cannot show that I am weak-willed, fickle, or inconsistent, because I have been in the Communist Party for seven years. In these long years, there was not a single moment when I did not fight for communism. I was arrested and imprisoned, subjected to inhuman torture. I fought hand-to-hand with the so-called "enemy" on the battlefield and was seriously wounded more than once. I fled to the mountains and forests, without a grain of rice in my stomach for three days. I used to get up at 5 am every morning and wait outside the factory gate in heavy snow and rain until 1 am at night before I could sleep. I continued this difficult and arduous life for seven years, and I did not change my attitude at all. I did not waver in my belief in the slightest. But this time, I changed my beliefs within twenty-four hours. The reason is very simple: it is my seven years of bloody experience. In the seven years of hard struggle, I deeply understood that communism is not suitable for China's national conditions, and the Communist Party is an obstacle to the Chinese revolution. To complete the Chinese revolution, we must first eliminate and destroy the Chinese Communist Party, which is destroying the Chinese revolution. Therefore, I resolutely and without hesitation moved from the ranks of the Communist Party to the anti-communist front line of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>2. My family was originally wealthy farmers and also owners of handicraft businesses. As a result of imperialist plunder and the shackles of feudal remnants, my family began to go bankrupt when I started school. By the time I entered middle school, my family could not provide any money for my tuition. This historical whip urged me to join the Kuomintang at the age of fourteen. Of course, after joining the Kuomintang, I worked very hard. Therefore, the Communist Party used various methods to win me over. In September of the fifteenth year, I joined the Communist Youth League under the dogmatic propaganda that "the Communist Party is helping the National Revolution, it can strengthen the National Revolution, promote the realization of the Three Principles of the People, and walk from the road of the Three Principles of the People to a communist society." The following year, in February, while studying at the Wuhan Central Military Academy, I joined the Communist Party. At that time, under the slogan of fighting for the "leadership of the Chinese revolution," I worked hard. After the Nanjing purge, under the slogan of "Down with the bourgeoisie who betrayed the revolution," I participated in the Western Expedition (i.e., fighting with Yang Sen and Xia Douyin's troops). When the Wuhan purge took place, the Central Military Academy was disbanded and reorganized into the Fourth Army Training Regiment, which was then transferred to Jiujiang and disarmed. I fled to Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Yancheng, lingering for several months. In the seventeenth year, I participated in local branch work and was then transferred to serve as the secretary of the XuhaiBeng Special Committee. In November of the same year, I was arrested and imprisoned until September of the nineteenth year, when I regained my freedom. I served as the director of the Document Section of the Jiangnan Provincial Committee and was then transferred to serve as the secretary of the Railway General Labour Union. Later, I was transferred to be the general secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial General of the Mutual Aid Association. In March of the twentieth year, I served as the director of the Jiangnan District General. In May, I was transferred to serve as the director of the Shanghai Municipal General. In September, I was transferred to be an inspector of the Mutual Aid Association in the outer counties of Jiangsu. In December, I served as a staff member of the General Association's Organization Department. In February of the twenty-first year, I helped with the work of the Hudong District General. In April, I served as the director of the Hudong District General. Soon after, I was dismissed from my work. In August, I was transferred to serve as the secretary-general of the General Association. This is my experience in the Communist Party for seven years, which is also the basis for my firm stance on the anti-communist front line.</p>
<p>3. In these seven years of hard struggle, in these seven years of bloody experience, I deeply felt that:</p>
<p>(1) Since the establishment of the Communist Party, according to the Communist Party's own conclusions, there has not been a single moment when it was not on the wrong path. In the fifteenth and sixteenth years, there was Chen Duxiu's opportunist error. In the sixteenth and seventeenth years, there was Qu Qiubai's blind actionist error. At the Sixth National Congress in the eighteenth year, there were errors regarding the peasant question and the worker movement. Now, the Communist Party has all kinds of disputes, but in the near future, it will surely discover that the lines of the twentieth and twenty-first years are also completely wrong. This raises the question of why the Communist Party is constantly making mistakes. The correct answer to this question is that China is not suitable for the implementation of communism and is not suitable for the existence of the Communist Party. No matter what strategy or line, whether it is left-wing, right-wing, or moderate, it will always be impossible to implement.</p>
<p>(2) According to China's environment and China's economic background, the Chinese revolution should be a national revolution against imperialism, a civil rights revolution to eliminate feudal remnants, and should implement the methods of regulating capital and equalizing land ownership to improve the lives of the people. But the Communist Party's主張, is precisely the opposite, inciting the so-called class struggle to disperse the strength of the national revolution, prolonging the life of feudal forces, and causing all the people, especially workers and peasants, to suffer from bankruptcy, unemployment, and displacement. This is the gift that the Chinese Communist Party has given to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>(3) On the question of anti-imperialism, the Communist Party, under the slogan of "Down with imperialism," is prolonging the rule of商国主义 in China, without any practical anti-imperialist work, and obstructing and destroying the people's anti-imperialist movement. Especially after the January 28th Incident, the Communist Party called for a general strike and peasant uprisings to oppose Japanese imperialism. In fact, this was not opposing Japanese imperialism, but destroying the united front against Japan and disrupting the rear of the resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>(4) Because the Communist Party has completely become an obstacle to the Chinese revolution, its influence among the masses is declining day by day. The masses' response to its calls has changed from passive indifference to active resistance. For example, when it calls for a strike, the workers reply, "This is the Communist Party making trouble," so no strike is initiated by the Communist Party. When it calls for a demonstration, the masses reply, "This is making fun of us," not only do they not participate themselves, but they also advise others not to participate, so no demonstration has any mass participation. When it propagandizes communism to the masses, the masses say, "What is said is good, but it cannot be done," or, "The benefits are in the future, we cannot wait, but at present there are only disadvantages, no advantages." These are all ironclad facts. These ironclad facts shatter the illusions of a very small number of masses about the Communist Party. Therefore, the Communist Party has no mass support at all and is a group of a few bare-handed adventurers.</p>
<p>(5) Since the Communist Party has completely gone bankrupt among the masses, the Communist Party is increasingly moving towards a state of disintegration. Most of the lower-level cadres are dissatisfied with the leadership of the higher-level cadres and continue to put forward dissenting opinions. These lower-level cadres who put forward dissenting opinions are often severely punished and attacked by their superiors and are constantly surrendering to the Kuomintang. In the past few months, more than 500 Communist Party members have surrendered. This astonishing number further proves the collapse of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(6) Because China's national conditions are not suitable for the existence of the Communist Party, many different opinions have arisen within the Communist Party. These different opinions have become the background for various small organizations in the organization. There is the left-leaning Li Lisan line, and there is the formation of the Li Lisan faction. There is the right-leaning opportunist line, and there is the differentiation of the liquidation faction. There are also the so-called Chen Shaoyu faction, Zhou Enlai faction, and all kinds of other factions. These factions are all trying to save the fate of the Communist Party. However, ironclad facts have proven that this attempt has completely turned into an illusion. No one can stop the collapse of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(7) The Communist Party is completely in a state of collapse politically and organizationally. The current central faction of the Communist Party, in order to maintain its last rule, on the one hand, uses dogmatic propaganda, saying, "The high tide of the Chinese revolution is coming soon, the initial victory of one or several provinces will be completed soon, and the Chinese Soviet revolution will be successful soon." In this way, it deceives the masses and wins over lower-level cadres. Such propaganda began as early as the eighteenth year, and it has been four years now. The so-called increasingly expanding Soviet area is still a roving bandit that flees east and west. The so-called "revolutionary high tide that is coming soon," the "October Revolution Festival" prepared for three months, resulted in only a few dozen most active cadres. This undoubtedly further disillusions the masses with the Communist Party and causes the cadres of the Communist Party to surrender to the Kuomintang. Therefore, on the other hand, it has no choice but to further adopt the means of red terror and assassination to prolong its last gasp. The recent tragedy in Siven Lane is a concrete manifestation of the Communist Party's assassination policy.</p>
<p>4. In summary, the Communist Party is not suitable for China's national conditions, and no matter what strategy or line it takes, it will be absolutely impossible to implement, it will inevitably not be supported by the masses, and it will inevitably lead to collapse and destruction. The facts have now proven that this assessment is completely correct. But what is the way out for China?</p>
<p>China is a semi-colonial country that is oppressed by the great powers of imperialism on the one hand, and is still bound by feudal remnants on the other, making it impossible for China's politics and economy to get on the right track very quickly. Domestically, there are neither very large landlords nor very large capitalists. Under such circumstances, only the implementation of nationalism can break away from the shackles of imperialism, only the implementation of democracy can complete democratic politics, and only the adoption of the methods of regulating capital and equalizing land ownership can enable the people of society to enjoy their welfare. In other words, only the implementation of the Three Principles of the People can build a new China and enable China to move towards great harmony.</p>
<p>Of course, the current state of China has some aspects that are unsatisfactory. However, there are reasons for this. These reasons are that imperialism has not abandoned its policy of plunder, and feudal remnants still continue to exist, but the main reason is the trouble caused by the Communist Party. Because the Communist Party is actually an assistant to imperialism and feudal remnants. We should not stand in a bystander position to criticize the status quo. We should study the causes of these status quo and make arduous struggles against these causes. In other words, to save China, we must resolutely rise up to eliminate the Communist Party.

<p>＝Arrested by Japanese Army When Yuyu Fell＝</p>
<p>＝Reported to Authorities and Still Went to Front Line＝</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: During the recent Japanese attack on Shanhaiguan County, Ma Hongru, the chief of the Second Branch of the local Public Security Bureau, braved the danger of bullets and arrows to serve as the negotiator. After the city fell, he was arrested by the Japanese army and forced to serve. Ma then responded decisively and designed an escape to Tianjin the other day. He immediately reported the experience to Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong and Civil Affairs Director Wei Jian. The following is a record of Ma's conversation.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Eve of the Incident <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Boxer Protocol, the Japanese army has occupied the West Main Street in the South Gate of Shanhaiguan, operating foreign firms, pawnshops, and selling drugs. After our country's revolution, they intensified their efforts, establishing gambling houses, resulting in a very complex situation where Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans lived together. Since the September 18th Incident, the local Japanese and Korean people have been unscrupulous and have repeatedly provoked disputes. In August, they forcibly occupied civilian houses and established the "Manchukuo Shanhaiguan Border Monitoring Police Team" (the police force was mostly composed of retired rogue soldiers and gangsters) and the Qin Island Japanese Garrison beat our soldiers. In October, they forcibly occupied the training ground of our 9th Brigade in the East City. On December 8th, Japanese armored vehicles shelled Yuyu City. Provocations were everywhere, in order to create an excuse for aggression. Fortunately, our local authorities and the 9th Brigade Commander He Zhuguo calmly responded, and no major disaster occurred. However, the crisis was still lurking and could erupt at any moment.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Cause of the Incident <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of January 1st, at 9 pm, the Japanese garrison stationed in Yuguan sent several soldiers to the Japanese Military Police Detachment Office next to the railway station to throw a grenade. They also threw two grenades in the railway station guardhouse (the Japanese army sentry's rest room) and several grenades near the pseudo-state police team. At the same time, the pseudo-state police team and the Japanese plainclothes team (Japanese residents' military veterans) fired small guns randomly for about an hour and tried to attack the South Gate. Our garrison Commander Shi telegraphed a report to Ping and ordered no retaliation, while sending personnel to negotiate.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Negotiation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>At 10 pm that night, I (Chief Ma himself) was ordered to go to the Japanese Military Police Detachment Office to inquire about the situation. At the same time, Chen Ruimin, the chief secretary of the Foreign Affairs Section of our 9th Brigade, also rushed to the scene. They immediately conducted negotiations together. Uno, the chief of the Japanese Military Police Detachment Office, represented the Japanese Garrison Commander Ochiai and warned us that the defense area of the South Gate should be immediately handed over to the Japanese army for guard, with a deadline of 50 minutes for a reply. At 11:05 pm, I and Director Chen entered the city (at this time the city gate had already been closed). At 12:15 am, I went out of the city again to the Japanese Military Police Detachment Office. Unexpectedly, Uno, without waiting for my reply, put forward the following four conditions: (1) Bombs were found at three places, including the Japanese Military Police Detachment Office outside the South Gate tonight, which is very dangerous. For the sake of protecting the railway and the residents, the South Gate will be temporarily guarded by the Japanese garrison. (2) Because the South Gate is guarded by the Japanese army, there are still soldiers from the 9th Brigade's Inspection Office present. To avoid misunderstandings, they must be immediately withdrawn into the city. (3) The police and security team in the South Gate are also afraid of misunderstandings with the Japanese army and must be withdrawn into the city, otherwise, they must gather in the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau and not go out. (4) The sentries of the 9th Brigade on the South City Wall must also be withdrawn to avoid misunderstandings. The entire South Gate will be guarded by the Japanese army. If the above four conditions are not satisfactorily answered, the Japanese army will immediately take free action. I thought that Uno's demands were too unreasonable and immediately reported to the Brigade Headquarters by telephone. Until 4:30 am on the 2nd, our Brigade Headquarters believed that the Japanese demands could not be accepted. The Japanese army was furious, like crazy, and took me to the Japanese Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Detention Process <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>At 4:35 am on the 2nd, I was escorted by Uno with more than 30 armed soldiers to the Japanese Garrison Headquarters, where I was subjected to insults and unreasonable reprimands. At 10 am, I was sent to the Military Police Detachment Office in the South Gate to monitor me and the 9th Brigade Headquarters communicating by telephone, hoping to trick Staff Officer Yu and Chief of Staff He into the Military Police Detachment Office in order to force them to accept their unreasonable demands. Unexpectedly, the result failed. The Japanese army then implemented climbing the city wall. Our soldiers on the city wall still did not retaliate. When the Japanese soldiers climbed to the top of the city wall, they began to throw stones, causing several to fall and break their legs and arms. Seeing that climbing the city wall had failed, the Japanese army began to shell the city with artillery. At this time, I was sent back to the Japanese Garrison Headquarters for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Overview of the Battle <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>At 11 am on the 2nd, the Japanese army used mortars to bombard our city from the courtyard of the Military Police Detachment Office. The Japanese Garrison also used heavy artillery to bombard the city. It stopped slightly in the evening. At 8 am on the 3rd, the Japanese navy, army, and air force jointly bombed, mixed with incendiary bombs. At noon, more than a dozen fires broke out in the city, and the smoke billowed into the sky. In the evening, the artillery fire subsided slightly. Our garrison Commander Shi was ordered to abandon the city to prevent the merchants and residents from perishing together. On the morning of the 4th, our army withdrew, and the fires inside and outside the city were raging. The order was greatly disrupted. The Japanese and Korean people and the Japanese army and pseudo-state police carried out large-scale looting and rape. I was forced to serve as the chief of the pseudo-Public Security Bureau to maintain local治安. All actions were under the command of the Japanese Military Police Detachment, and two Japanese soldiers were monitoring me, never leaving me for a moment. On the 6th, gentry and merchants were forced to organize a local maintenance association, and under the orders of the Japanese army, they assisted the pseudo-Public Security Bureau to maintain local治安 and issued notices to persuade merchants and residents to operate as usual. However, the rape and looting by the Japanese and Korean people and the Japanese army did not stop. The Public Security Bureau did not dare to interfere. Shops were forced to open, and goods and money were also robbed. It was not until the 8th, when Brigade Commander Suzuki arrived in Yuguan, that order began to recover slightly, and the fires inside and outside the city gradually extinguished.</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Miserable Situation After the War <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>About 200 shops were burned down, and more than 1,000 houses were damaged. Our army suffered about 500 casualties, and the Japanese army suffered about 400 casualties. About 100 of our residents died, and about 200 were injured. The losses are estimated to be over one million yuan. About 500 or 600 women were raped. Almost all the houses of residents with some assets were looted. The houses of residents that were not destroyed by the artillery fire were occupied by Japanese soldiers. The civilian houses that our army had rented before were regarded as rebel property by the Japanese and were confiscated and will be sold off soon. Our young students and strong men were falsely accused of being reactionary elements, and it is difficult to count those who died unnaturally.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Japanese Army's Aggression <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The original plan of the Japanese army was to deceive and open the city gate and carry out the occupation. At the same time, they wanted to take Changli and Luanzhou in one go. Unexpectedly, our army resisted, and morale was indignant. The city exceeded the Japanese army's expectations. Therefore, the Japanese army advanced to the east bank of the Shi River and failed to invade the west. I am a scholar, and fortunately escaped the tiger's mouth. Surviving the danger of bullets and arrows, I have long put my life aside. After reporting to the provincial government this time, I am still willing to go to the front to kill the enemy.

<h3 id="e104">Songjiang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Review of Commercial Profits and Losses</p>
<p>Songyi is a rice-producing area. Since the harvest last year, rice prices have plummeted, causing all businesses to decline. Although all industries reduced prices for competitive sales at the end of the year, life was still not prosperous. The following is an exploration of the annual operating profits and losses of various industries: The financial industry, with stable operations, all had surpluses. It is heard that the Xinyu Zhuang surplus was over 10,000 yuan, and Cheng Da's Xingyuan Zhuang and Liang Zhuang each had a surplus of 7,000 yuan. The Kangkang Zhuang is still newly opened and gained a surplus of 4,000 yuan, which is not easy. Pawnshops, banks, and farmers' banks all had surpluses. However, the Songjiang branch of the pawnshop bank has a narrower business scope and not much surplus. The next is the rice industry. Due to the plummeting rice prices in the first half of the year, they suffered heavy losses. The rice prices in various commissions were slightly higher in the second half of the year, but the time was quite short, and the gains did not make up for the losses. Most of them lost money. However, the Beihuitong Rice Shop still had a surplus. The North-South Goods, Medicinal Materials, Bricks, Ash, Oil, and Sesame industries all had surplus profits. The gold shop business was average. However, Defeng closed down and merged into Rifeng. The silk and cloth industry suffered losses due to the influence of Japanese goods. The foreign goods industry was average. The clothing industry suffered losses. The lumber industry only covered expenses. The sock factory was originally a newly emerging industry in Songyi, and the life was quite prosperous. In recent years, due to the war or disaster areas in the sales areas and the tight silver supply, most of them lost money. The cloth factory and carpet industry were slightly better than the sock factory industry, but there were few surplus profits. The new clothing industry also had no surplus due to the heavy eating of capital and poor collection of customer accounts. The Yongmaoheng New Clothing Shop even lost 18,000 yuan and went bankrupt. The Western medicine business was also average. Looking back at the city's business last year, everything was depressed.</p>

<p>In the case where the China General Chamber of Commerce sued the National Labour University Property Custodial Committee for denying a debt of over 200,000 taels, it appealed the first-instance judgment of the Shanghai court to the Jiangsu High Court. Wu Yuxin, the presiding judge of the Civil Second Chamber, tried the case. Yu Shouchun and Luo Yucheng, the agents of the appellant, the General Chamber of Commerce, were present, and lawyers Li Zuyu and Lu Shaozong were retained to present the reasons for the appeal. Tang Ying, the agent of the appellee, the State Labour Committee, also retained lawyers Tan Yigong, Yu Zhong, and Luo to respond. At the end of the trial, the judgment was made on the previous (27th) day. The main text: The original judgment is changed. The principal and interest of the silver owed to the appellant by the former Model Vagrant Two Factories is 100,077,792 taels and 45 cents, and the advance payment is 3,168 taels and 26 cents. Interest shall be given at the normal annual rate of 5% from the date of payment, and the insufficient amount shall be compensated by auctioning off the collateral. The appellee shall be responsible for repaying within the scope of the property left by the former Model Vagrant Two Factories. The remaining appeals and applications for provisional execution are rejected. The litigation costs shall be borne equally by both parties.</p>

<p>In Xiyi, outside the North Gate, at No. 36 Heng Street, Chang'an Bridge, the family of Mr. Ding Junxian stayed up all night for the Lunar New Year's Eve. Consequently, they went to sleep on the afternoon of the Lunar New Year's Day (January 26th). Unexpectedly, a stray spark from the morning caused a sudden conflagration, first burning through the staircase. The whole family was sleeping upstairs. By the time they realized it, thick smoke filled the air, and there was no way to escape. Moreover, the wind was strong and the weather was cold. Even when the fire brigades rushed to the rescue, the fire had already spread, making it impossible to extinguish. Ding's wife, Zhao, along with her four sons, one daughter, and the wet nurse, as well as Ding's widowed sister-in-law, Chen, and her one son and three daughters, and the maid Chunlan, totaling thirteen family members, large and small, tragically perished in the blaze. Only Ding Junxian himself and his eleven-year-old son, Xiaoshou, were spared because they went to pay New Year's greetings to relatives and then visited Chong'an Temple. At the same time, a Mr. Chen, formerly a partner in the Renyu sock factory, and his concubine had rented the remaining rooms of the Ding family as their love nest. They were also asleep at the time, and both were tragically caught in the disaster and perished in the fire. Mr. Chen has a wife in Suzhou, who has been notified by relatives via telegram to come to Xiyi to collect the remains.</p>

<p>Since the ban on exporting rice from Jiangsu was lifted, rice merchants have been actively taking advantage of the opportunity. Wuxi, as a rice-gathering area, has seen the export of over 100,000 shi of rice in the past two months. Consequently, the price of rice has risen from seven yuan to around nine yuan, resulting in significant profits. The main exporting firms are Longmao Baoyuan Dafengsheng, Xinchangyuan Hengyi, and others. The rice is transported by train to Beijing and Shanghai, and then transshipped to Tianjin, Bengbu, and Jinan. Most of the purchases are made by rice merchants who come to Wuxi. All expenses, such as transportation fees and passport fees, are borne by the merchants themselves and are not related to the exporting firms.

<h3 id="e108">General Situation of Various Industries After Final Accounting <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Although the various industries in Wuyi are not as prosperous as those in Suzhou and Wuxi, due to its location in the center of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the proximity of Yi, Liyang, and other areas from which people come to Changzhou to make purchases, it used to be above other counties along the line. However, since the January 28th Incident last year, the business of various industries has plummeted, a situation unprecedented. At the time of the business year-end closing, the situation of various industries is briefly recorded as follows: The timber industry is a major industry in Changzhou. Last year, due to the rampant bandits in the production areas, the source of timber was difficult to obtain, and the goods of merchants were burned by the bandits. In addition, foreign pine has taken the place of Western wood, causing great losses to those in this business. The bean industry is also a major industry in Changzhou. Bean prices were low between September and October last year, resulting in no profit. The financial industry was most affected after the Shanghai war. Firms such as Yongli and Runchang closed down one after another. Heshen Company, a decades-old brand, has temporarily suspended the collection of debts. Yongfu, Renfeng, and Tongde are considering forming a bank together. The rest, such as Yifeng, Taicheng, Hongxiang, Yutong, and Zhenkangyuan, are operating as before, but there were no profits at the time of closing. In addition, the decline of the silk and satin and foreign goods industries is also unprecedented. However, oil mills and oil shops have made considerable profits. Xiefeng Oil Mill has a profit of thirty to forty thousand yuan, and Fan Xiesheng Oil Shop also has a profit of twenty to thirty thousand yuan. Next in line is the paper industry, which is also in good condition. The rest are not worth mentioning.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Economic Decline and Industrial Depression <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The commerce here was greatly depressed last year due to the influence of the current situation. Since the Fengtai Yuan and Maichang financial firms closed one after the other, there are only two financial firms in Jiangyin, Yongcheng and Xiecheng. Fortunately, the Farmers Bank was established, relying on it to regulate finances. The cloth industry completely stopped trading in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, it was also greatly impacted by the North China war. Inland river steamers have seen a reduction in passengers due to the through traffic of Chengxi automobiles. However, in order to maintain the livelihood of the staff, they are reluctantly operating, incurring heavy losses. With the exception of small inns that can still be maintained, larger ones such as the Jiangnan Hotel have long been closed. In short, due to the decline of the social economy in the 21st year, the business of various industries has plummeted.</p>
<p>Official Letter</p>
<h3 id="e110">Letter from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: We have recently read a special telegram from Nanjing in your newspaper dated January 27th, which contains a piece of news that Sun Yat-sen, the President of our Yuan, sent a telegram to the authorities in the Southwest, requesting a united resistance against the enemy. After investigation, this does not correspond with the facts. President Sun advocates national unity against the enemy, which is the common desire of the people, but he has not sent this telegram. It is suspected that it is a rumor spread by well-intentioned people, which is being investigated. We hereby request a correction and hope that this letter will be published in your newspaper to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>January 28th</p>

<p>The Rehe situation is again urgent! All Chinese citizens have a responsibility to save the nation. To save the nation, we must first help the Northeast Volunteer Army, who are resisting the enemy's planes and cannons in the freezing weather. Artists are representatives of national culture, and they also have the responsibility of "saving the nation through art." Our association is now soliciting art works for the second time. We hope that artists and prominent ladies from home and abroad will donate their life's work, regardless of calligraphy, painting, sculpture, photography, embroidery, Western paintings, and other handicraft art works. We also hope that collectors from home and abroad will generously contribute their treasured antiques, calligraphy, and paintings to participate in the unprecedented National Art Exhibition, which will officially open at the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall on Guizhou Road, Shanghai, on February 12, 1933.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Declaration of Solicitation of Members by the Chinese Aviation Association <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association was officially established on New Year's Day. Its responsibility is to gather the strength of the people of the country, assist the government, develop aviation, and strengthen national defense. A telegram has already been sent to the compatriots of the country. Now, at the beginning of the Association's solicitation of members, the reasons for the establishment of the Association and the policies to be carried out are declared as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e114">I. The Reasons for the Establishment of the Association <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Among today's national defense tools, although the sea, land, and air forces are equally important, the air force is the center of gravity. Airplanes can soar through the sky and go wherever they want. Anything from the solidity of strong fortresses, the danger of deep mountains and valleys, and even the vastness of the army and the strength of the navy, from the perspective of the air force, all are unmanned territory. Bombing and sweeping can be done at will. In the past, wars were decided on the battlefield. Today's wars are to subdue the entire country. Once the war breaks out, the air force will be used in a violent manner. All of the enemy's prosperous cities and production centers must be destroyed quickly, either to cut off supplies to the front or to shock the people of the country. We can see from the European War in the distance and the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai in the near future. The need for national defense is therefore the most important for the air force. In addition, the construction of the sea and land forces is more complicated than aviation. The former requires tens of millions, while the latter can be achieved with only a fraction of that. Therefore, for the sake of economy and time, air defense is the easiest. This is why the Association is particularly dedicated to this. Today's war aims to subdue the entire opponent. So, it is of no use to try with all efforts. As the scale of the war increases, the content becomes more complex, and the cost must be greater. Therefore, the government and the people must work together to deal with the enemy. This is inevitable and undeniable. Since the European War, in addition to strengthening military preparations, the responsibility of national defense has gradually shifted from the realm of the military to the entirety of the nation. Military skills are to be taught to everyone. For example, patriotic people and national defense organizations are raising funds to purchase weapons and help the military. The Soviet Russian National Defense Aviation Chemical Association has purchased more than 500 aircraft for the military and raised funds to build aircraft carriers, reaching 15 million rubles in one year. The national defense of the great powers is already strong, but they are still expanding, hoping that the people will work together to overcome difficulties, and the people are also responding vigorously, considering it their duty, and even donating automatically. On the contrary, our country is very different. The territory of the Northeast has been seized, the borders have been removed, and there is no defense. The great powers are sharpening their swords and are ready to explode. The need for national defense is more urgent than in any other country, and the strength of national defense is more limited than in any other country. We are in this situation and witness this situation, how can we not be heartbroken? We know that patriotism and concern for the times are the same for everyone, but we have no way to contribute, so we are hiding and not expressing. There must be a fixed group to vigorously advocate, so that the people of the country and overseas compatriots can base their patriotic heart and release the real strength of saving the country, so that we can get the effect of all people helping together, and use the power of the people to build a city. This is why the Association should meet the needs of the times, and hope to unite the group's strength to help the national defense. In recent years, the strong neighbor has shown fierce flames, and the three northeastern provinces have been looted. The central plains have been ravaged even more. At present, the national situation is difficult, and future worries are even greater. If we procrastinate and let it evolve, the disaster of national subjugation will be inevitable, and we will suffer forever and never recover. In today's world, science is booming, and all advances are being made. Those who destroy the country use their political, economic, and cultural power, all accompanied by military force. They not only impose strict control but also refine the method of exploitation. The people of the victorious countries have no way to resist, and they are becoming increasingly poor. They are also imprisoned and taught, using a hundred different ways to make them stupid and docile, and to gradually forget their thoughts about their home country. This makes our country in today's real danger unprecedented. It is not only a matter of temporary safety, but also a matter of the rise and fall of the ages. If we now cheer up, things can still be done. If we do not seek this, it will be too late. This is why the Association wants to alert the eternal extinction of the national vein, and hope to correct fellow people, and to be effective in time.</p>
<h3 id="e115">II. The Implementation Policies of the Association <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Association is committed to the fact that aviation has no foundation, and we dare not neglect any expedient measures. The most important thing is to strive for self-reliance, and to plan for long-term development. Although there are many leads, and it is impossible to implement them all immediately, the following matters should be actively planned and completed as soon as possible. (1) Establish an aviation factory. All the aircraft that our country used to have were purchased from foreign countries. There has never been any attempt to build them ourselves. The price is high, and the goods are not of high quality. If we rely solely on purchasing aircraft in the future, the cost will be too high. Once a war breaks out, the source will be cut off. Old machines will break down day by day, and no new machines will be added. We will sit and be bombed by the enemy and have nothing to do. We should set up a factory to manufacture ourselves, so that scholars who have returned home after studying can have a place to make their own efforts, and those who are interested in research can learn. Therefore, the establishment of a factory should be urgently planned to lay the foundation for self-reliance. (2) Establish a civil aviation school. To date, our country only has a military aviation school. The personnel trained there are not enough. To talk about the expansion of aviation with so few people, even if it is done for a hundred years, it will not be remarkable. Therefore, we must train more experts to meet future needs. As for borrowing materials from other places, it is only suitable for the beginning, as a short-term hire. If we do not seek self-reliance and always rely on foreign guests, it will not only cost too much, but also be difficult to use as desired. Moreover, in the event of war, international relations will be strained, and foreign guests may be difficult to help. Therefore, planning the establishment of an aviation school, so as to create a flourishing of talents, is also a plan that cannot be delayed. (3) Develop civil aviation. Aviation has become a means of transportation to make up for the shortcomings of trains and ships. The assistance to air defense should be implicitly implied in it. Pure military equipment is all a waste of money, and it is useless in peacetime. The people are afraid that there is no continuing interest. Therefore, if we want to get the power of civil aviation in wartime, we must make it a daily need in peacetime, and the benefit of the country is in the benefit of the people. This means that civil use is the help of military use. All countries in the world assist private aviation with huge sums of money. Our country has a vast territory and a mild climate. Long-distance flights are most suitable. However, due to the obstruction of traffic and the difficulty of travel, the need for aviation is most urgent. The development of civil aviation is not only the foundation of military preparation, but also the need of the times. All of these require a lot of money, and for the sake of urgently needed aircraft, we have to purchase some. This requires the enthusiastic participation of the people of the country and the joint burden of the Association. It also requires the efforts of people from all walks of life. We also plan to request the government to provide subsidies as appropriate. For the custody and use of these funds, the Association has formulated an aviation fund custody committee to take responsibility for it. We have also settled on regulations to be observed, so as to prevent the abuse of encroachment, and to ensure that there is no waste. All income and expenditure must be open, which is natural and needless to say.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Unifying the Strength of Civil Aviation <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Association has something that cannot be said. Since we want to use the power of the people to help the government's air defense, all planning must be convenient for civil use and suitable for the needs of the government's military use. The structure of aircraft, the training of personnel, and all equipment must be uniform, so as to produce the corresponding efficiency. To achieve this, the unification of the strength of civil aviation must first be achieved. Otherwise, it will be complicated and chaotic, each doing its own thing. Even if civil aviation is developed in peacetime, it will not be enough to meet the needs of wartime. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the Association, the unification of the strength of civil aviation was used as a call. This is what the situation demands, and it is not to be done.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Being in the Same Boat, Working Together <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>To sum up, our country not only has the danger of extinction, but the pain of national subjugation is not comparable to the past. We will always suffer for generations to come, and there will be no chance of recovery. Self-help and saving the country are today. Protecting the country requires the joint efforts of the people, which has become the common trend in the world today. The people of our country are rising up spontaneously, and they need to be more urgent than the people of other countries. The way to work is aviation, which is the easiest and most important. The Association is based on the common desire of the people of the country, hoping to make a concrete expression. I believe that we can all cherish the meaning of "when the skin is gone, what will the hair be attached to," and also swear to the sincerity of "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." With the determination to be in the same boat, working together, the Association assumes the responsibility of advocacy. It is necessary to encourage the heart of chastity, and to make sure that the collection of one piece will become a fur coat, and that one money will be used for one money. Alas, things are urgent, the enemies are deep, and the gentlemen of our country, let's get up and come!</p>
<h3 id="e118">Suggestion to Purchase Public Debt Airplanes <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The National Salvation Ten-Person Group sent a letter to the holders of domestic public debt, saying, "The national crisis is urgent. The blood of the Battle of Shanghai is still vivid, the beacon smoke in the Northeast has not extinguished. Aviation to save the country is an urgent and temporary solution. However, patriotic organizations are often more than willing but lack the power. Your association represents the highest asset class in the country. Please donate two or three months of principal and interest to purchase a fleet of public debt aircraft to meet the national crisis. After that, donate one month of principal and interest every year as a fund for planning and setting up aviation manufacturing. This matter is of public interest, and the loss to you is very small, but the remedy for the national crisis is great. Please immediately decide to implement it, and directly allocate the funds from the surplus under customs, and work with the government and national salvation organizations to organize a supervisory committee to supervise the use. I think you have a great heart, and you will not deny it and leave it in the middle without issuing it."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Telegram Passed on the Anniversary of the January 28th Incident <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Four Telegrams Sent Yesterday</p>
<p>When the various sectors of the city held the anniversary of the January 28th Incident at the Youth Propaganda Troupe the day before yesterday (January 28th), four telegrams were passed. The texts were found and recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram Requesting the People of the Country to Unite Against Japan. Since the January 28th Incident occurred, it has been a year. The lost land of the three provinces has not been recovered, the traces of blood in Shanghai are still vivid, and the news of the police in North China has occurred again. Yuguan has been lost, Rehe is in danger, the volunteer army has collapsed, the thieves are arrogant, the door is open, and the threat of death is imminent. The Japanese warlords are inching forward, and the ambition to destroy our country and nation is obvious. The League of Nations is not reliable, and the enemy's cavalry is driving straight in. If the people of our country do not rise up quickly to resist the enemy and save the sinking, we will see that the ancient country of China will become the continuation of Korea and India. Although the enemy's armaments are superior and inferior, the number of victories and defeats is not entirely dependent on materials. The spirit of the soldiers is also very important. Looking at the Battle of January 28th, our 19th Route Army and the 5th Army fought bloodily with the enemy for 34 days. They persevered and repeatedly thwarted the enemy's ferocity. Although the enemy changed commanders four times and increased reinforcements, they were never able to cross the Leichi step. It can be seen that the national soldiers are loyal and brave to defend the country, and if they are given the benefit of weapons, there is no fear that they will not be able to recover the lost land and drive the strong enemies out of the country. Now, fortunately, the disaster areas along the Yangtze River have gradually recovered, and the bandits in the provinces have been successively suppressed. This is the time when the whole country should concentrate its strength to save the country. I wish that the loyal and brave generals of our country would purge the dangers of death and eliminate the disputes of barbarians, following in the footsteps of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, holding a spear forward and fighting to kill the enemy, so as to fulfill the military's duty to defend the country. The compatriots of the country should quickly rise up to be the backing of the government, generously donate, gather huge funds, and help the government purchase aircraft and weapons, so as to increase the strength of resisting the enemy, and strive to boycott goods and strictly sanction traitors, so as to control the economic life of the Japanese. With common planning and common strength, things can still be done. Alas, things are urgent, the situation is pressing. If we do not eliminate the strong enemy, we will not be able to save the country. If we do not recover the lost land, we will not be able to survive. The whole country should make the greatest determination, unite the strength of the whole country, and swear to resist the enemy to death, recover our land, and avoid the danger of the country and the nation. The representatives of Shanghai held a memorial meeting on the first anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>(2) Telegram Requesting the League of Nations to Resolve the Northeast Incident and Stop the Aggression of Violent Japan. To the International League of Nations: Since Japan invaded the Northeast, your spirit of maintaining peace is admirable. However, the violent Japan has no ambition, and it has achieved an inch. It has created a false organization with one hand, and has included the three northeastern provinces without remainder. Recently, it has expanded the incident, invaded Yuguan, and invaded the Rehe River. Your association has not taken any concrete measures, which is regrettable. Now that Japan's militarism has forced us to retreat, we have no choice but to continue the spirit of the January 28th Shanghai War and fight to the death with the enemy for the sake of self-help and self-defense of the Chinese nation. At this critical moment, I hope that your association will follow the spirit of the covenant, take resolute and effective measures as soon as possible, and stop the aggressive behavior of the violent Japan. Otherwise, your association should be fully responsible for the rupture of peace in East Asia. The association feels the intensity of the disaster suffered in Shanghai last year and can't bear to see the compatriots in North China suffer the same fate. Therefore, on the occasion of this painful anniversary of January 28th, I would like to make a final sincere appeal to your association on behalf of all sectors of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Telegram Requesting All Generals of the Country to Mobilize to Resist Japan. In the Battle of January 28th, the Japanese warlords claimed that they could occupy Shanghai in four hours. When the war broke out, our 19th Route Army and the 5th Army fought with the enemy for 34 days, so that the enemy changed its commanders four times but could not cross the Leichi step. This spirit of bravely resisting the enemy is enough to express the great power of our nation that cannot be humiliated. It can also be seen that the strength of resisting the enemy is not only in whether there are elite weapons, but also in whether our people have the spirit of independence and self-reliance. The 19th Route Army and the 5th Army have this spirit, so they can chill the enemy and inflict heavy damage on it. If all our soldiers have this spirit, why worry about not being able to recover the lost land and drive the enemy out of the country? Today is the anniversary of the January 28th Incident, and the Japanese warlords who have not been successful in the southeast are thinking of showing their ferocity in our North China. The danger of Yuguan has been lost, and the danger of Rehe is even more urgent. If Rehe is lost, Pingjin will not be guaranteed. If Pingjin is not guaranteed, the country will be destroyed in no time. The soldiers of the whole country should fulfill their duty to defend the country and make a great move to save the country. If they can unify their minds and concentrate their strength, the lost land can be recovered, and the great revenge can be avenged. At the time when foreign insults are serious, it is time for the soldiers of the whole country to serve the country. I hope that we can mobilize together and go to the national crisis together. Then, Shao Kang will prosper Xia with one army, and Xiang Yu will perish Qin with eight thousand. The achievements are the same in ancient and modern times. The survival and continuation are in this one move. The head of the hero is the culprit, and I hope you will choose yourself.</p>
<p>(4) Telegram Requesting the People of the Country to Donate Funds to Purchase Aircraft to Defend the Country. Since the fall of the Northeast and the bloody Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese imperialist's ambition to invade our country has been fully exposed. The people of the country also deeply know that if we do not resist the enemy, we will not be able to talk about saving the country. The way to resist the enemy must be that the soldiers are strong and the weapons are sharp, and then the national defense can be strong. In today's scientific era, aircraft are the only important military equipment for national defense. Since the European War, the great powers have paid attention to it, so the annual expansion is recent. The Japanese industry and commerce have donated funds to purchase aircraft to give to the government for the purpose of enriching the national defense. Looking back at our country, the sea and land military preparations have been behind, and the air force equipment is even more lacking. Therefore, in the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Yuguan, our army's combat power was not as good as others, but the enemy was able to drive straight in. From this, we can know that it is difficult to win by relying solely on the sacrifice of flesh and blood. At this time when the international situation is becoming increasingly serious and the situation in North China is becoming increasingly tense, if we do not build an air force and enrich national defense, the country will be destroyed in no time. In addition to supervising the city's residents to donate funds to purchase aircraft, the General Assembly hopes that the people of the country will work together to actively donate funds, and strive to achieve the goal of donating one aircraft per county. It will be a great blessing for the country.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying, "I have read the telegram from Shinohara. The troops of Su Bingwen, Li Du, and others have successively retreated from the Eastern Province into the Russian territory, and are in urgent need of repatriation. The Ministry has repeatedly reported to the various departments in charge to discuss the repatriation measures. In addition to remitting funds for relief and supply, we are now contacting the Russian side for repatriation procedures and actively proceeding, so that the righteous army fighting against the Japanese can return to the motherland soon.

<p>The Shanghai County Government's relocation to Beiqiao began last Monday. As of yesterday, all documents and items had been relocated. All county government officials also went with them. The memorial week this Monday (today) will be held in the new county seat, and it is scheduled to start working on February 1st. The old site of the county government will be taken over by the city government. In case documents are sent there, County Chief Yan has ordered one official and one guard to be stationed temporarily. The Finance Bureau may be relocated today or tomorrow, and the Education Bureau will have to wait a few more days.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Headquarters has decided to complete the relocation by January 31st. Cars have been hired every day to transport documents and equipment to the new site. A letter has also been sent to the post office stating that documents sent to the department should be delivered to the new address at Beiqiao Town, Hu-Min Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e123">General Zhu Qinglan Urgently Appeals for Relief to Destitute Kailu Disaster Victims <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees received a confidential telegram from General Zhu Qinglan in Peiping, stating: "Telegrams from the Kailu Farmers' Association and others report that since the September 18th Incident, businesses and residences have been seized for military barracks and stables. Businesspeople, women, and children are exposed and destitute. The tragic cries are heartbreaking to witness. Therefore, I urgently appeal for immediate relief and hope that major charitable organizations will widely solicit donations and remit them as soon as possible." After receiving the telegram, the association replied yesterday through Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Zheng Hongnian, and others, officially appointing Qu Wenliu to go north to preside over the distribution. Several months have passed, but the funds are insufficient for the widespread disaster, causing great anxiety. The original telegram stated, "To Old Master Zhu Zi in Peiping, esteemed recipient: I have received your confidential telegram and deeply sympathize with the disaster situation in Kailu. I admire your thorough planning in sending Yang and He to work with local parties to deliberate on solutions. It is the duty of this association to use all relief funds and goods for the northeastern refugees, ensuring that every drop goes to those in need. We previously appointed Standing Director Qu Wenliu to go north to preside over the distribution. Several months have passed, but the funds are insufficient for the widespread disaster, causing great anxiety. My ability is weak, and I feel increasingly ashamed."</p>

<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association, considering the Japanese army's preparations to invade Peiping and Tianjin and the escalating crisis in North China, telegraphed Zhu Ziqiao yesterday to allocate bullets to Tang Juwu's troops and provide funds for assistance. At the same time, various requests for assistance and related news were received from various parties, and are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Telegram to Zhu Requesting Assistance for Tang Juwu <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>General Zhu Ziqiao, esteemed recipient: I have received a telegram from He Sui reporting that Commander Tang Juwu has repeatedly fought bravely against the enemy since the uprising in Liaodong. Later, due to being surrounded and without support, he painfully retreated. His 60,000 troops are dispersed and lying in wait, awaiting an opportunity to rise again. However, they are in a difficult situation, lacking food and clothing, and urgently need assistance. Tang himself is gathering his old troops on the border, preparing to advance eastward and is particularly eager for support. Furthermore, Tang's representative, Li Ji, brought Tang's handwritten letter and a formal letter requesting assistance prepared by Li. After deliberation, it was decided to provide bullets and 5,000 yuan in assistance. In addition to sending the funds to Mr. Zhang Peinian for remittance, please deposit nearby rifle bullets with you for allocation and allow Tang's troops to claim and use them. Respectfully, the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association.</p>

<p>Most Urgent: To the Shanghai Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association: Since the September 18th Incident, our army has repeatedly fought bitterly against the enemy forces between the Black Mountains and White Waters. Last year, after the defeat of Su and Ma, our army concentrated around Tongliao and continued to fight with the enemy forces. Reports of our army capturing Tao'an, attacking Fangshan, and breaking through Sifangtai are merely the more prominent achievements. However, our army's ability to fight bitterly against the enemy relies on rear support. Now, a large enemy force is gathering in Tongliao, and our army is at the forefront. The supply of ammunition and provisions is even more dependent on your association's fundraising efforts. Therefore, we have specially dispatched Comrade Li Shitai as a resident representative in Shanghai for close consultation. I implore your association to pay attention to the great cause of resisting Japan and quickly devise ways to provide assistance. I am deeply grateful. Respectfully, Huang Yongping, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern National Salvation Army.</p>

<p>He Menghua, Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Army, sent a telegram: Our army of 3,000 attacked Suizhong, engaging in a fierce battle for three hours and killing dozens of enemy soldiers. Currently, our troops on the front line number over 6,000, with over 10,000 more gradually concentrating for battle. However, ammunition is often insufficient. We hope you will quickly allocate 200,000 bullets and 30,000 yuan in temporary living expenses to meet urgent needs and achieve complete success.</p>

<p>Business Resumes as Usual from Today</p>
<p>Money Exchanges Also Resume Operations</p>
<p>After the final accounts were settled, various industries in this city traditionally closed for business. Yesterday was the fourth day. According to custom, the God of Wealth is welcomed, so many people were selling carp along the streets. Because carp are commonly known as "yuanbao fish," they are an essential item for welcoming the God of Wealth. After welcoming the God of Wealth, all industries will open for business as usual from today. Money exchanges were originally scheduled to close for four days and will also resume operations as usual from today. However, due to the impact of the January 28th Incident, various industries are extremely depressed. After the final accounts were settled, there were fewer businesses that added capital to continue operating. However, the number of businesses that were unable to maintain operations and ceased operating was numerous.</p>

<p>Intensify Training and Prepare to Go North to Kill the Enemy</p>
<p>Liu Zhongying, Zhou Zhaolin, Huang Fei and other executive committee members of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Union, considering the arrogance of the enemy and the daily increasing danger to the nation, believe that only the strength of the entire citizenry is not enough to save the country, and yesterday specially submitted a letter to the Citizens' Union, requesting that the Citizens' Volunteer Army be convened immediately, that training be intensified, and that they go north to kill the enemy. The original letter is recorded below: (Omitted above) Our Citizens' Union, at the time of the September 18th Incident, felt the pain of the invading Japanese devils and the fear of the imminent demise of the country. Thereupon, the Citizens' Volunteer Army was established. The committee members planned with all their hearts and trained through the night, preparing to go to the Northeast and compete with the enemy. This was the duty of the citizenry and also a rare act of distinction for your union. Who knew that the enemy would be aggressive and exhaustive, and, having gained Long, look to Shu, invading the Northeast and then attacking Shanghai. The bloodstains of September 18th were not yet dry, and the tragedy of January 28th was born. Our Citizens' Volunteer Army, volunteered to defend against the enemy, pressing forward despite all obstacles. The enemy's courage was chilled by the battle of Baoshan. Such a tragic and fierce battle cannot but be admired by the people of the nation, and foreigners also praised it. After the Shanghai battle stopped and the peace treaty was signed, the loyal and brave Citizens' Volunteer Army, which defended the country, was unknowingly dissolved. Could it be that the lost territory has been recovered and military preparedness is no longer necessary, or that the Northeast is too far away and assistance is no longer needed? What could be more painful than this? Zhongying and others look to the Northeast and see Peiping and Tianjin. The shouts of the Volunteer Armies and the warnings of the National Army are still loud. Thus, it is known that the hearts of the people are not yet dead and that national affairs can still be done. Therefore, we specially suggest to your union that you convene the Citizens' Volunteer Army again immediately, intensify training, go to the Northeast, and participate in defending against the enemy, so that this shattered China can be made whole again and this declining Chinese nation can be revitalized. Please implement this immediately. We eagerly await your response. This is addressed to the Citizens' Union.</p>

The two elders talked about the changes of the world and felt deeply moved by the past and present. That evening, he also accepted the invitation of Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, to a banquet.

<p>Increased Harvest Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, the Department of Agriculture of Jinling University reports that the national agricultural harvest in the past year was better than the previous year (i.e., 1931), with an increase of about 25%. This is because the previous year was affected by floods. However, the wheat crop was the second worst in the last five or six years. Overall, the quantity of various harvests last year was more abundant than in the most recent five or six years. As of the end of November of last year, over 1,000 reports had been received from various provinces regarding the national harvest statistics for last year. A total of 129 reports were received from 41 counties in Jiangsu Province. The harvest quantities for last year and the previous year are recorded below: (1932) [The following are in units of one dan]: Wheat 5.837, Barley 3.231, Rapeseed 58, Early Rice 4.019, Late Rice 4.654, Soybeans 2.684, Corn 625, Sorghum 1.084, Sugarcane 4.065, Cotton 345.

<p>US Side Dissatisfied with Guarantees Offered</p>
<p>US Representative Remains in Shanghai to Seek Alternative Solutions</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai News Agency, negotiations on the continued loan of American wheat from the US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation have been suspended because the US side is dissatisfied with the guarantees offered by the Chinese side. However, the US representative stationed in Shanghai is still working hard to find new solutions to avoid a breakdown. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Stumbling Block for Suspension: It is widely rumored that the biggest stumbling block to the suspension of the continued loan of American wheat is the opposition of the national public. However, according to the Shanghai News Agency reporter's investigation, when the Ministry of Finance began negotiations with the US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation, national public organizations sent telegrams of opposition. Finance Minister Song Ziwen even issued a statement on this matter, stating that the continued loan of American wheat would not harm the national food problem. It is clear that the Ministry of Finance's sudden suspension of contact with the US side was not due to public opposition, but because the US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation was dissatisfied with the guarantees offered by the Chinese side for the continued loan of American wheat. The Chinese side was also unwilling to continue due to the harsh conditions of the US side, leading to the abrupt suspension of negotiations between the two sides. The US representative stationed in Shanghai has reportedly telegraphed the authorities, reporting the process of the suspension of negotiations.</p>
<p>US Representative Remains in Shanghai: Another report states that the US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation recently telegraphed its representative stationed in Shanghai, instructing him to continue negotiations with the Chinese Ministry of Finance regarding the continued loan of American wheat and to consider the guarantees offered by the Chinese side in order to avoid a breakdown. Therefore, the US representative is currently planning to find new solutions in the hope of breaking the deadlock.</p>
<p>Song to Return to Nanjing Tonight: Finance Minister Song Ziwen's purpose in coming to Shanghai this time was to contact the Shanghai banking community to discuss financial issues. After several days of meetings, the result was very satisfactory. The US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation's representative stationed in Shanghai even visited Song some days ago to discuss the continued loan of American wheat. However, due to various reasons, Song expressed his unwillingness to continue negotiations, resulting in no results. It is learned that Song has completed his official business in Shanghai, and the central government in Nanjing has many affairs awaiting his approval. Therefore, he has decided to return to Nanjing by night train tonight.</p>
<h3 id="e138">No Such Thing as Rice Being Shipped to Japan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Reports that the Japanese side is secretly purchasing white rice in Shanghai for export to Japan and Dalian are surprising. According to responsible personnel of the Customs Administration, the export of white rice from this port has always been prohibited. However, since the bumper harvest this autumn, rice has been stockpiling on the market, and the price of rice has been falling. Therefore, since December 24th of last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has allowed merchants to obtain passports to transport rice out of the province, but only to various domestic ports (excluding the three northeastern provinces). It is heard that the largest quantities of this white rice are shipped to Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao. As for shipping to Japan and Dalian, there is absolutely no such thing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association held a joint meeting of the northern and southern market traders at Cuixiu Hall in the city at 2:00 PM yesterday. Committee members present included Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Chen Yuming, Chen Ziyi, Cai Yukun, Zhu Xiangsheng, Jiang Zisheng, Zhu Ziming, Wang Shengyuan, and over a hundred people. Because Chairman Gu Xinyi had other important business, Chen Ziyi was elected as temporary chairman, and the meeting proceeded as usual. The following resolutions were passed: (1) To determine how to reduce the rice price when new measuring instruments are implemented on February 1st. Resolved: When using the new municipal bushel, each stone of rice will be calculated at 85% of the sea bushel market price at the time of the great settlement. (2) To reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's inquiry about the precedent for distributing public reserve funds to stores. Resolved: To reply as previously agreed. (3) To re-investigate the names of various colleagues. Resolved: To do so in the future, once every year. (4) To reply to the Shanghai South distributor's inquiry about the names of the shareholders of Wan Kangxing. Resolved: To have the Shanghai South branch office investigate and reply. (5) The Social Affairs Bureau issued instructions that, based on the request of the Anhui Rice Industry Association in Shanghai for Anhui rice to be shipped to Shanghai, it should be reported whether the rice from the lower reaches of the river is lightly measured. Resolved: Anhui rice shipped to Shanghai has always been measured in level bushels and is no different from the rice from the lower reaches of the river. Since the Anhui rice industry has objections, it is possible to change the measurement to weight in the future, with each stone calculated as 200 pounds. Report this to the Social Affairs Bureau. (6) Procedures for new businesses to join this association. Resolved: In the future, when new colleagues join this association, they must have a member of this association recommend them and consider them qualified before they can be registered, issued a membership certificate, and licensed to operate. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Ministry of Military Affairs Prohibits Soldiers from Forcibly Boarding Freight Cars <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs issued a notice yesterday, posted at various stations along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines, regarding the following matter: The Railway Police Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Railways reported that soldiers from the Independent Brigade of the Fourth Division stationed in Fengyang County forcibly boarded freight cars at Mentai Zi Station every time they went to Bengbu. Despite repeated polite dissuasion, the soldiers ignored it and even sought trouble and beat railway staff. A letter was sent to the Fourth Division requesting strict prohibition to emphasize the importance of freight cars. The headquarters of the division replied, stating that the brigade commander had been ordered to strictly prohibit subordinates from forcibly boarding freight cars again and to send personnel to Mentai Zi Station to strictly arrest and punish offenders.</p>
<p>In view of this, it is found that responsible transportation has been gradually implemented on all routes. The responsibility for guarding freight cars is extremely important. No personnel should forcibly board freight cars during transportation. The Transportation Regulations clearly stipulate this. However, the garrison troops along various routes are unaware of this and often forcibly board freight cars as they pass by, refusing to be dissuaded and even deliberately making trouble for the railway police, delaying traffic. Such a situation hinders the future of railway transportation. It is appropriate to consult and order the commanding officers of the garrison troops along each route to strictly prohibit this and issue and print notices to be posted at various railway stations to maintain railway administration. It is hereby ordered that responsible transportation has been gradually implemented on all routes. No military personnel shall forcibly board freight cars to maintain the railway. In accordance with the previous consultation, in addition to issuing a circular to the garrison troops along each route to strictly prohibit their subordinates, a public notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. You must strictly abide by this notice. Minister He Yingqin.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charity Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui received an official letter yesterday from Kang Jiyao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association, stating: "With respect, the disaster in Shaanxi has continued for years and is now increasingly severe. People are fleeing everywhere, villages are in ruins, and the tragic situation is worse than in any other province. We have repeatedly requested relief. Previously, when your association was in charge of raising relief funds for the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, we earnestly requested that Shaanxi be included, not to distribute the funds already raised, but only to allocate some of the relief funds raised in Shanghai and other places in the future to Shaanxi to help those in need. Recently, the Executive Yuan decided to allocate 500,000 yuan to Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, although the funds have not yet been delivered. This shows that Shaanxi, like Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, is one of the provinces most severely affected by the disaster and should be treated equally. We earnestly request that Shaanxi be formally included to extend compassion and relief. We will be eternally grateful."</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Handle it Properly</p>
<p>The Wu Song Steamer eviction of workers case has been going on for twenty days. Despite the efforts of Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing to mediate, it has been ineffective. The Municipal Government received a telegram from the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it. Yesterday, the laborers submitted a petition to the authorities, requesting serious negotiations. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>The Bureau and Association Mediate: After receiving the order from the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits, the Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it properly. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Lianze, Chief of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Department, and Xu Shiqi, Officer of the Seafarers' Party Department, summoned labor representatives Zhou Xiaoting and Lu Shuangxi at the Municipal Party Department to inquire about their opinions. The labor side requested serious negotiations to resume work as soon as possible. The Party and government agencies promised to do their best to mediate.</p>
<p>Petition for Negotiations: The Wu Song Steamer Case Relief Association submitted another petition to the Party and government agencies yesterday, requesting serious negotiations, as the matter had not been resolved for twenty days. The original petition stated: "Petition requesting continued serious negotiations and agreement to guarantee resumption of work. (Omission) After the Wu Song Steamer case occurred, injured workers such as Cao Yansheng filed a lawsuit against the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association of the capitalists in the Shanghai District Court for the crime of injury. However, the case has been delayed until now. The capitalists' China Shipping Mutual Aid Association is cunning in every way, trying to shirk responsibility. In fact, those responsible for creating the problem must resolve it, and their relationship is generally recognized. However, the Taikoo Company itself is even more callous and inhumane. Despite the deep suffering of our country, they also ignore the power of the government, considering their concession land in Shanghai as a talisman, acting arbitrarily, buying patrolmen, and preventing workers from boarding the ship to resume work. The workers are in a difficult situation and cannot delay any longer. Therefore, we submit another petition, hoping that you will consider the livelihood of the workers and quickly continue serious negotiations to benefit labor movement."</p>

<p>Xia Aibao, a woman from Huzhou, is 14 years old this year. Last year, her mother, Xia Pan (43 years old this year), as her legal representative, hired three lawyers, Wu Kaisheng, Li Xiaobai, and Ma Hongyuan, to file a criminal self-prosecution in the Second Special District Court against Tian Siwei, a member of the Anti-Japanese Association, for interfering with the family. Recently, she was summoned again, but the defendant still did not appear in court. Her lawyer stated that the defendant was unable to appear due to illness. The self-prosecutor Xia Pan stated the purpose of the lawsuit. Her complaint stated: "Her husband died early, leaving behind one son and one daughter. At that time, the son was 5 years old and the daughter was only 3 years old. Because the family was poor, she had no choice but to work as a wet nurse in Shanghai, sending her earnings back to her daughter Aibao to support her. When Aibao was 13 years old, because she was lively and active, she was sent to learn to dance. In a few days, she mastered the art and danced at the New New Dance Hall. Unexpectedly, the defendant Tian Siwei also danced in the hall and forcibly invited the civil woman to dance a duet, thus becoming acquainted. The defendant was lecherous and saw that her daughter was not bad-looking and of a young age, so he had lewd intentions. In December of the same year, he tricked her into going to the Great Shanghai Hotel in the name of having fun and opened room 102. He enticed her with sweet words and then unleashed his lewd power, saying that he had no wife at home and wanted to marry her and live together forever. When her daughter refused, he forcibly tore off her daughter's lower garment and stuffed her mouth. Her daughter was only</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Ordeal of Wang Sibao, a Child Without a Father <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>His Mother Sues Wang Qiduo in Court</p>
<p>Seeking Confirmation of Paternal Relationship</p>
<p>Wang Qiduo, residing at No. 18 South Wuxi Road, met Bu Huiying, a woman from Wuxi, in the 18th year of the Republic [1929]. At the time, the woman was 39 years old. Initially, their relationship was covert, but by the first month of the following year, they were formally cohabitating. They originally hoped to spend their lives together, but after only ten months, they separated. On the 22nd day of the eleventh month of that year, Ms. Bu suddenly gave birth to a baby boy, who is now three years old. According to Ms. Bu, the child was conceived during her cohabitation with Wang and should be Wang's son. Therefore, she gave him the surname Wang and named him Sibao. She contacted Wang to request support. Because Wang denied paternity, she has now retained lawyers Yan Jiangyi, Wu Saitai, and others to file a complaint against Wang in the First Special District Court. The plaintiff is the three-year-old child Wang Sibao, with Bu Huiying acting as his legal guardian. The lawsuit seeks confirmation of the father-son relationship. The complaint states that the plaintiff's mother, Bu Huiying, had a relationship with the defendant in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], and formally cohabitated in the first month of the following year, resulting in conception. In the tenth month of the same year, they ended their cohabitation. On the 22nd day of the eleventh month (i.e., the 3rd day of the tenth lunar month), the plaintiff was born. The birth of the plaintiff occurred just over one month after the separation of his parents. The conception clearly occurred during the period of cohabitation of the parents, leaving no doubt that the plaintiff is the defendant's son. The father-son relationship is based on blood ties. Although the relationship between the parents has ended, its effect cannot extend to their offspring. The defendant intends to abandon the child, leaving the plaintiff as a child without a father. Previous requests to the court for mediation were unsuccessful. Therefore, it is necessary to file this complaint with the court, requesting confirmation that the plaintiff is the defendant's son, and that the defendant be ordered to bear the costs of the lawsuit. This would be a virtuous act. The First Special Court recently held a hearing, summoning both parties for interrogation, but the proceedings have not concluded and will require further hearings at a later date.</p>

It is also called "Chujiu," referring to the deceptive nature of the game.

Upon interrogation, the defendants confessed to the fraudulent gambling scheme. Judge Zhang Renkan reviewed the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained pending sentencing.</p>

<p>｜Two Thugs Commit Heinous Act Out of Grudge｜</p>
<p>At 5:35 AM the previous morning, just as dawn was breaking, two thugs speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly barged into the hair salon of Lu Lian'gen, located at No. 219 Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai. One was wearing a blue cloth overcoat, and the other was wearing a dark-colored long robe. They entered directly, making a ruckus, and demanding to see "Old Lu." Seeing that the situation was not good, the owner's wife, Lu Mao, replied that he was not there. The two thugs stood still for a moment, then said they wanted to collect a debt from her. They turned to leave, but unexpectedly, about ten minutes later, the two thugs rushed back in again. One of them pulled out a pistol and fired a shot at Lu Mao, hitting her in the chest. She collapsed to the ground in agony, bleeding profusely. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two thugs turned and left, firing two shots into the air as a warning before fleeing. The owner of the shop, Lu Lian'gen, immediately reported the incident to the local Sixth District Police Station, which then reported it to the General Administration. The injured woman was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, due to the severity of her injuries, she died shortly after. The Sixth District ordered the local district head to report to the District Court for an inquest. Subsequently, the court-appointed prosecutor arrived at the scene and determined that the victim had died as a result of being shot in a vital area. The family was instructed to prepare the body for burial and await the apprehension of the murderers for severe punishment. It is rumored that the reason for the shooting was a grudge against Lu, prompting the thugs to commit this heinous act of revenge.</p>

<p>｜Arrested and Returned to Shanghai After Discovery｜</p>
<p>Xu Kuizheng, a native of Changshu and former employee of Wang Chunjis’ Transportation Company at No. 182 Jiujiang Road, had been dismissed by his employer, Wang Baichun. Xu learned that a crate of silk, containing seventy-four pieces worth over one thousand yuan, had been deposited with the Far East Transportation Company on North Suzhou Road for pickup by Wang Chunjis'. Xu forged Wang Chunjis’ company chop, created a false withdrawal slip, and claimed the goods from the Far East Company. He pawned twenty-eight pieces of the silk at Jinshun Pawnshop on Avenue Edward VII to obtain funds and then eloped to Shengze with a seventeen-year-old prostitute, Zhu Suzhen, to the home of his brother, Xu Haisheng. Subsequently, Wang Chunjis sent an employee to the Far East Company to retrieve the goods and discovered the theft. They reported the incident to the Huizi Police Station. In addition to retrieving the stolen goods from Jinshun Pawnshop, they dispatched detectives Fang Qingyun to Shengze to arrest Xu Jinsheng, Xu Haisheng, and the prostitute Zhu.

<h3 id="e163">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Writes to Public Utilities Bureau Requesting Rectification of Jiangwan Bus Services <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, on the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from the Jiangwan Branch Office of the Chamber, stating that various businesses have complained about the corrupt management of the Chinese Public Bus Company and requested the Public Utilities Bureau to strictly reform it. The complaints are summarized as follows: (1) Unlimited passengers, endangering public safety. The company's vehicles have signs at the entrance stating that the car is limited to 28 passengers. Although clearly stipulated by the Public Utilities Bureau, the cars are often loaded with 50 or 60 people, with greed as a common occurrence. Passengers who want to reach their destination are unable to squeeze off the car. How can it not create opportunities for thieves to pickpocket? (2) Ticket checkers, ticket sellers, and drivers are mostly impolite, arrogant like noble princes, looking down on everyone, scolding and fighting as common practice. Even military officers do not issue orders to their subordinates in such a tone. There are often women in the area who sell wool, carrying goods in front and back, occupying seats every day, and these people arbitrarily approve or reject the boarding of old women and young girls. How can public utility personnel be so corrupt? (3) Using inferior engine oil, harming public health. When the vehicle starts, there is an indescribable stench that emanates from the front of the vehicle and spreads to the rear, filling the cabin. People on opposite sides cannot distinguish each other's faces. How can it be tolerated when the north wind is severe and the doors are tightly closed? The above three points are the corrupt situation of the company. Public utilities are closely related to the development of the city. At the beginning of Shanghai's public utilities, all our citizens should warmly support it. To supervise improvement is our inescapable duty. Since the operation of this vehicle, it has provided much convenience to merchants and villagers in the area. However, the company is only interested in profit, ignoring the purpose of public utilities, and using the patent right as the only protection, without concern for corruption. The local needs are like this, and the corruption of the company is like that. The harm to the city and the citizens is increasing day by day. The competent authorities should not tolerate it. Although it is said that the losses from this war were not small, the simplification should not reach this extreme. This matter has been presented to Supervisor Jiang by the local Party Headquarters. It has not changed in a month. Therefore, we re-emphasize the recent situation and request that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau be promptly forwarded for realistic training and reform. It will not only be the fortune of Jiangwan, but also the future of the city. Based on this, the public bus service in this city was originally intended to develop the city and facilitate public transportation, and the operation should strive for perfection. According to the statements made by the branch office, all passengers on public buses believe that the statements are true and that strict rectification is urgently needed. Accordingly, we hereby send this letter, hoping that your Bureau will investigate and promptly order the company to strengthen the improvement, so as to benefit passengers and so on."</p>

<p>Near the end of the year and the beginning of spring, there have been six boat collisions on the Huangpu River, which can be described as eventful. The circumstances of the incidents are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Xin Ningxing Damages Wooden Boat: A stone boat of Zhang Hexing Shipyard in this city, which was carrying crushed stone on the morning of the 18th of this month at the No. 2 Wharf of Dafeng, Nanshi, was hit and sunk by the Rongji ferry. The shipyard then sent another Ningbo-style wharf to salvage the sunken boat. At 8:00 AM on the 24th, while the boatmen were working, the Xin Ningxing, a ship of the Sanbei Company, which was berthed at the Ningbo-Shaoxing Wharf to the north, turned away from the shore and headed south, damaging the stern wood of the wharf boat and breaking the lead rope, resulting in a loss of over one hundred yuan. Afterwards, the boat owner, Zhang Aru, reported the incident to the Maritime Customs Water Patrol Police for investigation.</p>
<p>Jinghu Ferryboat Sinks Passenger Ferry: At 9:50 PM on the 24th, the No. 1 passenger ferry of the Pujiang Ferry Company on Jiujiang Road, with eight passengers on board and driven by Xia Yuxiang, set off from the company's wharf and headed towards the Dongjiadu Shipyard outside the Pudong river. At that time, the Customs Jinghu ferry, sailing from south to north at high speed, suddenly collided head-on with the passenger ferry. The small ferry could not withstand the impact and tilted, taking on water, and gradually sank to the bottom of the river. All eleven passengers and crew members were rescued by the Jinghu ferry crew, which was fortunate.</p>
<p>Xin Ning Shao Sinks Coal Boat: At 5:00 AM on the 25th, a coal boat owned by Wang Linfu, carrying 25 tons of coal, sailed to the Ning Shao Wharf at the 16th Pier and moored, preparing to unload it onto the Shanghai-Ningbo route Xin Ning Shao ship. Before long, the ship arrived at the port, and when it was turning to berth at the pier, the propeller in the back suddenly struck the front section and starboard side of the coal boat, creating two holes. Water immediately poured in, and the entire boat sank to the bottom of the river, fortunately without causing any injuries.</p>
<p>Baohe Wheel Damages Stone Boat: At 10:20 AM on the 25th, two stone boats, No. 12325 and 23435, owned by Chen Daoyou, were moored on the Pudong Lujiazui riverfront outside a barge belonging to the Huangpu Engineering Bureau, unloading cargo. At that time, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Baohe steamship was sailing from downstream and turned at that location, simultaneously damaging both boats. Afterwards, the owner of the damaged boat, Weng Achun, reported the loss of 4,000 yuan to the Water Patrol Police for compensation.</p>
<p>Coal Boat Sinks Feces Boat: At 12:00 noon on the 27th, a feces boat owned by Wang Bingfu, carrying a full load of human waste, was moored on the Suzhou Creek near the Zhejiang Road Bridge. At that time, the Puan Company's No. 10782 coal boat entered the river from the Huangpu River during high tide. When it reached under the Zhejiang Road Bridge, it was suddenly hit by a small ferry belonging to the Huangpu Engineering Bureau. The steam boat was simultaneously pushed and collided with the feces boat, damaging the stern of the feces boat, which took on water and sank, filling the river surface with overflowing waste, which was unbearably foul.</p>
<p>Xin Su Wheel Damages Wheat Boat: At 12:50 PM on the 28th, a wharf boat owned by Yao Changgen, carrying 230 bags of wheat, sailed into the Suzhou Creek during high tide. Just as it reached under the Tianhou Palace Bridge, the Xin Su ferry behind it was also sailing in. Unable to avoid it, the Xin Su ferry struck the starboard side of the wheat boat, causing the wheat boat to collide with a tugboat on the south bank. The bow of the wheat boat was immediately damaged. Afterwards, Yao reported the incident to the Water Patrol Police for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Shipping and Customs Declaration Industry Pays 100,000 Yuan in Security Deposit <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai shipping and customs declaration industry, since the Ministry of Finance Customs Administration ordered Jianghai Customs Taxation Department Director Luo to strictly crack down on it, each household must pay a huge amount of security deposit in order to prove that the business firm has assets. It has been more than a year since the promulgation of the policy. The reason why it was not implemented in the past was that the capital sizes of the industry firms were different, but the amount of the security deposit was non-negotiable. Although the chairman and committee members of the industry, Shi Zhikun and You Senting, repeatedly consulted with Luo Taxation Department Director Fude to change the methods, the industry association raised 100,000 yuan to the Central Bank as a security deposit for all members of the association. In addition, those who have not joined the association will be cracked down on. On the 18th of this month, Luo Taxation Department Director was invited to a banquet at the Navigation Administration Club, and the difficulties of the industry were explained in detail. Luo Taxation Department Director was understanding. It is now heard that if the industry wants to do business, it must first apply to the association for membership, and only after the association has passed the examination and ordered the payment of a security deposit of 3,000 yuan can it do business.</p>

<p>Lu Jinfu, a native of Baitong, 21 years old, from a certain number on Dingxing Road behind Datong Lane, South Ke Road, is working as a messenger at a lawyer's office. There are still parents in the family. In the past, after finishing his service at the lawyer's office, he returned home. But on New Year's Eve, he walked out of his home late at night. It has been a few days since then, but he is missing. At first, Lu's parents suspected that he was working at the lawyer's office, but a lawyer said that Lu did not come to rest during the New Year. It was not until yesterday that they learned that Lu had been missing for many days. In addition to sending people out to investigate his whereabouts, they also reported to the local police station to inquire whether there were any vehicle accidents during these days.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Ambition and Inferiority <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>|| Cai Niansun's Letter ||</p>
<p>Yuan Daofeng said in "New Year's Dreams": "China will have a dictator in the future. If this dictatorship does not adopt the imperial system of Napoleon, it must adopt the republican form of Kemal. As for the form of Mussolini, he is unwilling to adopt it. This is because Chinese people have this inferiority complex, that is, they do not want a monarch superior to themselves." || See the New Year's issue of Oriental Magazine || Yesterday, I read the history lectures on the opposition and evolution of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and I increasingly believe that Mr. Yuan's words are correct. Wasn't the usurpation of Jin by Liu Song, the usurpation of Song by Qi, the usurpation of Qi by Liang, and the usurpation of Liang by Chen, as well as the usurpation of Wei by Northern Zhou and Northern Qi, all because they were unwilling to have a monarch superior to themselves, so they wanted to replace them to satisfy the desire for "sole dominance"? In a certain sense, that kind of desire can be regarded as ambition. But the root of the problem also lies in this: personal ambition hinders the upward momentum of the nation and society! Here, I have two points to ask the reporter for guidance: ㈠ How is this kind of ambition (?) cultivated? ㈡ Why doesn't it exist in other ethnic groups? Please enlighten me!</p>
<p>Answer: The letter is confusing. I thought you were a middle school student, and I was very disappointed. I was unwilling to answer, but at the end, I saw that the place where the letter was forwarded was a pawnshop, and I thought you might be an apprentice, which is not surprising. Therefore, I will point out the errors in your letter one by one as follows. ㈠ Mr. Yuan Daofeng's high-sounding theories published in the Oriental Magazine have no basis at all. The so-called "dictator" in Western languages ​​is Dictator or Diktatur, which means dictatorship. Dictatorship is a form of state power. For example, the Soviet Union adopts the form of proletarian dictatorship, and democratic countries in Europe and America, such as the United States, Taiwan, Britain, France, Switzerland, and Germany, are all forms of bourgeois democracy dictatorship. The National Party governments of Italy and Turkey are forms of bourgeois one-party dictatorship (Mussolini and Kemal are just their representatives.) Some people say that China's current political form is similar to the dictatorship of the Turkish National Party, and there is no need for Mr. Yuan to come and hope or predict any "future". However, we will not study for the time being whether the political form of the Fascist Party or the Turkish National Party itself is good or bad. However, the Turkish National Party has made Turkey stand tall as an independent Eastern country. Although the Italian Fascist Party is also the extreme right force in capitalist countries, it can still maintain national independence. What about our country? We should not criticize "Chinese people" who "do not want a monarch superior to themselves" as our "inferiority complex". Before discussing whether this statement is correct, please ask Mr. Yuan to go back and study history before speaking. You must know that Mussolini and Kemal are not monarchs. The former's position is equivalent to the long-term prime minister, and there is still a monarch above him. The latter is the president of a republic. What "monarch" are you talking about? Because you read history, you "increasingly believe that Mr. Yuan's words are correct." The so-called "usurpation of Jin by Liu Song... and the usurpation of Wei by Northern Zhou and Northern Qi" are all "because they were unwilling to have a monarch superior to themselves, so they wanted to replace them to satisfy the desire for 'sole dominance'." This statement is even more specious. Because the opposition between the Northern and Southern Dynasties each had its material conditions and political background. All the disasters of "sole dominance" that followed the usurpation at that time were formed by the social system and autocratic history at that time. That is to say, this kind of political tragedy and evil psychology were the products of the social system and the history of autocratic politics at that time. It is the result, not the cause. You were shocked by Mr. Yuan's fallacies in the Oriental Magazine, so you inevitably reversed cause and effect and suffered a lot! As for the term "ambition," it has been completely misunderstood by people. If a person has gained some knowledge and has gained a little false reputation, but he is not satisfied with this, but feels that his reputation does not match reality and feels deeply ashamed, so he works harder and strives for perfection. This is ambition. A person leads troops to defend the territory. Although he knows that he will be defeated in the face of enemy planes and artillery, he still fights back with weapons and has no regrets even if he dies. This is ambition. An apprentice is unwilling to be insulted and abused by others, so he studies hard and struggles for the poor compatriots, disregarding his own interests. This is also ambition. The so-called "ambition" is to strive to be superior, not to be an emperor, to "be the first to worry about the world's worries and the last to enjoy the world's joys," not to have the ambition of "I am fat and the world is thin," to "treat the people as my brothers and sisters, and things as my companions," rather than to think about eating delicacies and owning billions of assets, to be the servant of all people rather than the running dog of one person and one family. Otherwise, that is a complete "inferiority complex"! To be honest, if you change your words and say, "㈠ How is this kind of ambition cultivated? ㈡ Why do other ethnic groups have it, but our ethnic group does not?" then we can have a good discussion, although it is still only smelling a part of the truth? If you are not satisfied with the above answer, please write to me and I will talk to you.</p>

Therefore, yesterday, Zhao Yan, editor and reviewer of the National Compilation and Translation Hall, was specially sent to Shanghai to collect materials from various parties. It is reported that Mr. Zhao arrived in Shanghai yesterday and started working.</p>

<p>| 3 to 2 |</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 26th) The 1932-33 Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match was held at the Happy Valley Stadium here this afternoon. More than 10,000 Chinese and Western spectators attended. As a result, the Shanghai team defeated the Hong Kong team 3 to 2. The Shanghai team's scorers were Corlett (2 goals) and Chen Jiaqiu (1 goal). The Hong Kong team's scorers were Da Gaoshan Nu and Ran Zhaozhao (1 goal each). The Shanghai center-back line was very strong, especially Fan Ensi, who was outstanding.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lineup</p>
<p>Braley, Feng Yunyou, Turner, Fan Ensi, Za Xu, Remy D Hughes, Chen Jiaqiu, Corlett, Jack, Ke Zhi</p>
<p>Hong Kong Lineup</p>
<p>Lo Cha, Liu Mao, Alan, Duncan, Pai Duo, Ran Rongzhao, Si Lu, Xiao Gaoshan Nu, Da Gaoshan Nu, Huang Meishun, Zheng Shaokang</p>
<p>Hong Kong Scored in the First Minute: The Hong Kong team kicked off first and had the advantage of the wind, so they took the offensive. The Shanghai team tried hard to resist, but after just one minute, Da Gaoshan Nu went straight in and scored a goal. The Shanghai team's army was unlucky, and the defense showed panic at times. Fortunately, left-winger Ke Zhi attacked along the edge, and Chen Jiaqiu also seized the opportunity. However, Hong Kong goalkeeper Lo Cha calmly saved them all. Ke Zhi once had a perfect opportunity, but unfortunately, the ball rebounded from the goalpost. Corlett also frequently tried to shoot, but none of them hit. Later, Hong Kong defender Alan missed his footing, and Corlett got the opportunity to shoot, but his strength was weak and Lo Cha saved it. Corlett shot again fiercely when the ball rebounded, and the goalkeeper could not save it, making it 1 to 1.</p>
<p>Shanghai Took the Lead 2 to 1: Shanghai left-forward Jack, seeing Corlett's success, also wanted to work hard, but he performed too much individually, so although the opportunity was good, none of them hit. Then, Chen Jiaqiu got the ball, dribbled past Pai Duo, and shot from the 20-yard mark. It was accurate and rapid, and Lo Cha could not save it. The ball went into the net again. In the first half, the Shanghai team took the lead 2 to 1.</p>
<p>Liang Rongzhao Scored and Lost: After the lemon time, the Hong Kong team was eager to counterattack and attacked the goal very quickly. Then, Ke Zhi injured his foot, and Shanghai fought with ten players. Hong Kong's offensive became more intense. Later, Ke Zhi returned to the field, and the momentum turned strong. Unexpectedly, Feng Yunyou missed his footing, which was almost dangerous. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Fan Ensi of Shanghai fouled outside the penalty area. Liang Rongzhao took the penalty, and the ball went into the goal from the right corner, making it 2 to 2. At this time, both sides attacked fiercely, and the back and forth was rapid, which was very exciting. Unexpectedly, Feng Yunyou suddenly fouled in the penalty area. This ball was quite suspicious, so Liang Rongzhao kicked it intentionally wide of the goal and made it a wild ball, which won applause from the whole audience.</p>
<p>Corlett Made the Final Contribution: At this time, the Shanghai team's position was quite dangerous because Chen Jiaqiu suddenly reported a foot injury. Fortunately, he entered the field soon. In the last minute, Corlett finally scored a goal to decide the outcome. As a result, the Shanghai team won 3 to 2. Looking at the overall situation, Shanghai's connection was excellent, and center-back Fan Ensi was the most outstanding. The defense was weaker, and goalkeeper Braley seemed to be better than Lo Cha that day. The Hong Kong center-back line, except for Liang Rongzhao, was average.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Lost to Chinese United <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>| 2 to 5 |</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 28th) The Shanghai Interport Football Team, which defeated the Hong Kong Interport Team 3-2 on Thursday, lost to the Hong Kong Chinese United Team 2-5 this afternoon. The Shanghai team's representatives remained unchanged except for Hughes replacing Remy D. The number of spectators reached 17,000, a new record for this season.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Lineup</p>
<p>Braley, Lu Yunyou, Turner, Fan Ensi, Za Xu, Hughes, Chen Jiaqiu, Corlett, Jack, Ke Zhi</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chinese United Team Lineup</p>
<p>Lin Tiancan, Liu Mao, Li Tiansheng, Deng Guang, Lin Yuying, Liang Rongzhao, Chen Guangyao, Ip Pak-wah, Fung King-cheung, Tam Kong-pak, Zheng Shaokang</p>
<p>The Chinese United Team Had Strong Strength: In the first half, the Hong Kong Chinese United Team took the lead with 1 to 0. Their strength was indeed strong. Although the Chinese United Team increased by four goals in the second half, if the Shanghai team had good luck, they could have hit at least four goals. The scorers for the Hong Kong Chinese United Team were Tam Kong-pak and Fung King-cheung (2 goals each), and Ip Pak-wah (1 goal). The scorers for the Shanghai team were Chen Jiaqiu (1 goal) and Corlett (1 goal).</p>
<p>The First Half Ended 1-0: In the first half, the Chinese United Team took the offensive mostly. One minute after the kick-off, Ip Pak-wah had a shooting opportunity, but it did not hit. The Shanghai team counterattacked, and the Chinese United defender kicked it out. Fung King-cheung sent the ball to both wings with great certainty. Shanghai goalkeeper Braley tackled a dangerous ball kicked by Zheng Shaokang and collided with Ip Pak-wah. He was injured and left the field. He returned after a few minutes. Then, Tam Kong-pak received a warning for tripping Za Xu. Za Xu wanted to raise his foot to shoot, but seeing Ke Zhi on the side, he passed the ball to Ke. Unfortunately, this ball went wide. Corlett also had several opportunities, but he did not shoot immediately after passing to both wings, so he lost a good opportunity. Tam Kong-pak got the ball from Fung King-cheung, dribbled past Yi Na, and scored with one foot at the goal. In the first half, Hong Kong Chinese United 1, Shanghai 0.</p>
<p>Fung King-cheung Also Scored: The second half continued. Jack lost an opportunity to hit an empty goal. Za Xu passed the ball very accurately. Corlett once broke into the hinterland of the Chinese United team, but the shot turned into a wild ball. Ke Zhi was very active. His shots made Lin Tiancan unable to catch them, and he also unfortunately hit the crossbar, twice. All did not succeed. At this time, the Shanghai team took the offensive entirely, but the Chinese United team took advantage of the situation and returned to score. It can be said that the Shanghai team lost countless opportunities. When Hughes was flustered, Fung King-cheung scored another goal for the Chinese United team.</p>
<p>Corlett Recaptured a Goal: The Shanghai team failed to score repeatedly and lost another goal, which can be said to be extremely unfortunate. However, the momentum of pressing on the Chinese United team did not diminish because of this. After repeated efforts, center Corlett also established a credit for Shanghai. The Chinese United goalkeeper was now the target of public criticism. Corlett got the pass from Hughes and hit the vital point.</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu Headed in One: Tam Kong-pak then shot in with a swift foot, and Chen Jiaqiu of the Shanghai team also got a clever cross from Ke Zhi and headed it in. At this time, the score was Chinese United 3, Shanghai 2. The tension of the situation was unprecedented. The audience shouted and became even more enthusiastic, which was rare in Hong Kong football matches.</p>
<p>5 to 2 Chinese United Won a Big Victory: The last two goals were scored in five minutes. Hughes got the pass from Jack and was only three yards away from the goal and could have kicked it in to tie the game. However, Hughes failed to take advantage of this great opportunity, which led to a slump. When everyone was in a melee in front of the Shanghai team's goal, Braley was injured in the head and left the field for a few minutes before returning. Then, a fire broke out in the stands, and the audience's attention was shifted, and then it was extinguished. The Shanghai team then launched a major offensive. Hughes took a long shot that almost hit. The Chinese United team counterattacked, and Fung King-cheung got the pass from Ip Pak-wah and shot in a goal, and Ip also shot in from 30 yards. The Hong Kong Chinese United team won the final victory with a score of 5 to 2.</p>

<p>Result: 3 to 2</p>
<p>Donghua Overcomes the Russian League</p>
<p>Result: 4 to 1</p>
<p>The Tianjin Russian Émigré Football Team traveled south to play an intercity game against the Shanghai Russian Émigré Team. On the 27th, the two teams competed at the China Baseball Field. As a result, Tianjin defeated Shanghai 3 to 2 and won the first championship. Yesterday, the Tianjin-Shanghai Russian Émigré Joint Team played against the Donghua Team, and Donghua overcame the Russian League 4 to 1. At that time, the baseball field was quite crowded, which was an unexpected grand event in the midst of the quiet football scene.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Team Wins the Championship　When the Tianjin-Shanghai Russian Émigré game began, the world chess king, Erlanggen, happened to be in Shanghai and was invited to perform the opening kick-off ceremony. The Tianjin team's forwards were strong and aggressive, but their shots were not accurate, and the Shanghai team scored first. In the first half, the Shanghai team led 1 to 0. In the second half, the Tianjin team's momentum was strong, and they scored three goals in a row. The Shanghai team tried hard to counterattack and scored one goal, but ultimately lost 2 to 3. The first championship and a large silver cup jointly presented by the Russian Émigrés of the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department both went to the Tianjin team.</p>
<p>Donghua Overcomes the Russian League　Yesterday, the two teams held a friendly match at the baseball field, and there were many spectators. Donghua's three major players, Feng Yunyou, Li Ning, and Chen Jiaqiu, went to Hong Kong to participate in the intercity game, and Tu Kaiyuan, Wu Youliang, and others also did not play, so their strength was reduced, which was expected. However, they were much stronger than the Russian League. As a result of the 90 minutes, they won 4 to 1. In the first half, Li Yichen scored to make it 1 to 0. After Li Yichen scored again in the second half, the Russian Émigré center, Kebuding, also scored one goal. In the last 20 minutes, Chen Hongguang broke through the opponent's goal twice, and ultimately won 4 to 1, winning the silver cup presented by the Russian Émigré United Association.</p>

<p>｜Result: Victory with 30 to 24｜</p>
<p>The Pirate Team has strong strength and a great reputation in Shanghai. All the Chinese and Western teams in Shanghai are inferior to them and dare not show off. In recent years, they were once defeated by the Northeast University basketball team led by Hao Gengsheng. People at the time said that the King from beyond the pass overwhelmed the pirates on the sea. Like white clouds turning into grey dogs, this time they were soundly defeated by the Central Military Academy basketball team led by Du Tingxi, which they did not expect.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Five Games Overview <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Military Academy came to Shanghai and fought five games in a row. In the first game, they lost to Shanghai University 46 to 63, due to bad luck and the fouling out of two forwards. In the second game, they gradually revealed their true skills, and each of the five tigers made contributions, winning against John 48 to 28. In the third game, they met the Pirates for the first time. The whole game was extremely exciting, with the score fluctuating from time to time. They were still in the lead in the first half. The second half was extremely tense. In the last three minutes, they were behind by four points and ended up losing, with a final score of 45 to 41. In the fourth game, they played against Mailing. They were disappointed on the court, and Mailing showed great power, being invincible. In the first half, Mailing scored 31, and the Military Academy scored 14. In the second half, the Military Academy lost 31 to 64. The last act was a great success, and the Pirates' reputation was shaken. Everyone embraced the determination to fight to the death, calmly responding to the battle. In the five-man defense, they adopted the method of individual surveillance, both internally and externally, and finally won 30 to 24.</p>
<h3 id="e192">A Worthwhile Trip <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>After the five games were over, the team returned to Beijing on the 28th. All the students in the school, hearing the good news from afar, couldn't help but dance with joy. Once they return to school, there will be a grand welcome. Du Tingxi, the leader of the team, said that there are very few strong enemies in Beijing. In order to increase experience, they came to Shanghai for sightseeing. The impression gained this time was quite good, and it can be said that it was a worthwhile trip. In the future, they will work harder and live up to the expectations of the Chinese people. It is expected that in the whole army competition, the Military Academy team can compete with the national talents.</p>

<p>···Rebounded by 5.4 Taels···</p>
<h3 id="e194">Although Silver Price Rose, Gold Price Rebounded <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>On the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday, the gold market trended upwards again, mainly because the international situation was volatile. Although US silver rose by 0.625, bank telegraphic transfers only increased by 0.375. The measures taken by the industry were not appropriate, and the exchange rate was tightened first and then loosened. The banks' appetite was originally healthy, but it became increasingly tight, so the gold market saw a rebound. Initially, overseas silver markets in London rose by 0.1875 across both spot and forward contracts, and US silver rose by 0.625. Forward silver prices also rose by more than 0.04. Both the British pound/US dollar and US dollar/British pound exchange rates continued to surge. Although the opening price was low at 774.5 taels, down 3.1 taels from the previous close, because bank telegraphic transfers did not rise much, stocks also fell slightly. The exchange market opened without any significant easing, and market sentiment was still good. Shunli initially offered to sell at 774 taels, Qian Changxiang came in and increased to 5 taels, and Daxingyong also increased to 6 taels. Shunli retreated to 5.5 taels. Citibank bought US dollars for April delivery at 0.9375, and Changshengyong advanced to around 6 taels. January sterling traded at 0.375. HSBC wanted to settle, and Hengmei went on the market to buy, pushing it up to 7 taels, and there was a period of consolidation. As for April US dollars, they only traded at 0.8125, which was 0.125 tighter than the initial opening, so there was an increase. Hengxing and Dadecheng competed to buy, and in a blink of an eye, it rose to 79.9 taels. After selling some goods, it went downstream again, hovering around 9 taels. When Sumitomo bought sterling for April delivery at 0.3125, there were no transactions in the market, and it jumped to 81 taels. Finally, because the price was raised too sharply, sellers became active, and it fell back by about 2 taels to 79.7 taels. The trading volume was light. Dadecheng continued to buy at around 80 taels, and Hengxing bought aggressively, and the exchange market was also tight. MacCarry bought US dollars for April delivery at 0.8125, and it rose to 81.7 taels and consolidated. HSBC announced that the sterling rate was flat and the US dollar rate rose by 0.025. Hengyu initially offered to sell, retreating to around 80 taels, plus 0.0875. US dollars for May delivery could not be sold. Qingfayong continued to sell at 78.8 taels. Afterwards, there were not many transactions, and it was often seen hovering. Later, news came that the Central Bank opened 280 telegraphic transfers, and finally pulled up. Wanxing, Shunli, and Yuanchun all bought, and Dadecheng and others also bought telegraphic transfers as agents for the Central Bank's opening of spot transactions, and broke through 80 taels again. Afterwards, the industry replenished exchange, and the gold price did not go downstream, but it also fluctuated for a while. Yuanchun continuously cleared short positions, although the amount was not large, it was able to hold the price at around 80 taels. Yingfeng and Henglai bought at 0.03 taels, and Ruikang retreated to 79.5 taels. Cuichang advanced to 0.05 taels. US dollars for April delivery traded at 0.0875, and US dollars for February delivery traded at 0.0625. Mitsui blocked all bids, and it fell to within 80 taels. Dadecheng and Wanxing bought again (the Central Bank's spot price was 80 taels). Yuanmaoyong bought telegraphic transfers, and general retail investors all came to raise the price to 2 taels. Yuanchun also advanced to 82.6 taels. Datong sold US dollars for January delivery at 0.05625, and it dropped to 0.05 taels. Afterwards, because the exchange market was tighter than the previous day's closing, and the Central Bank's price was expected to shrink, market sentiment turned better. The Dalian gang, Wanxing, advanced again to 83 taels. The transaction price only turned back a bit. The final result was still 783 taels, an increase of 5.4 taels compared to the previous close. It was found that although the city only traded for half a day, there was a fluctuation of 9 taels. In addition, due to the Lunar New Year holiday, the trading volume was slightly narrow. The highest price was 783 taels, and the lowest price was 774 taels. February registration was 785 taels, March registration was 783 taels, and water replenishment was 783 taels. There was no real transaction in arbitrage, but in fact it was still generally an increase of 10.05 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Fewer Price Quotations and Less Trading <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The price quotation was because the US dollar exchange rate announced by HSBC rose by 0.025, and the gold price was 849.56 taels, a reduction of 66 taels, a decrease of about 13 taels compared to the previous close (on the 4th). There were fewer trades among industry players. Hengxing, Dadecheng, Changshengyong, Qian Changxiang, Cuichang, Yuanmaoyong, Wanxing, and spot brokers all bought, while Shunli, Qingfayong, Hengyu, and Ruikang sold. Yuanchun gradually covered short positions, accumulating small amounts into large sums. In addition, there were few trades and no fixed trend.</p>

<p>Estimate of Silver Dollars Shipped to Dalian Last Winter</p>
<p>January 25th was the Lunar New Year's Eve in our tradition, and it was also the last day of the general settlement for the commercial sector. All annual business procedures must be completed on this day, and the silver money industry is no exception. Therefore, the amount of collection and settlement procedures is also the most complicated of the whole year. It is estimated that the total amount of collection and settlement by foreign banks reached 45 million, while the collection and settlement by Chinese banks was also 67 million. Foreign merchants deposited 2.2 million into warehouses, and Chinese merchants deposited 1.2 million. The collection and settlement of money houses and silver brokers was more than 60 million, and the collection and settlement of foreign public companies was more than 20 million. The market price of foreign taels in the morning market was 7 qian 1 fen 2 li 2 hao 5 si, and in the afternoon market it was 7 qian 1 fen 2 li 7 hao 5 si. The transaction volume was 1.825 million in the morning market and 840,000 in the afternoon market. The bill of exchange volume was 65,000 in the morning market and 70,000 in the afternoon market. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market. Because the transaction of overnight interest rate bills had ended, there was no market to open, so there were no quotes in either the morning or afternoon market. The Jiangnan small silver dollar was 6 qian 0.08 li in the morning market and 6 qian 0.02 fen in the afternoon market, with a difference of 1 fen 0.01 li between the two markets. The transaction volume was 7,500 jiao in the morning market and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 5 qian 9 fen 5 li in the morning market and the same price in the afternoon market. The transaction volume was 135,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The silver dollar increased by 5,000 wen, to 405,000 wen. The transaction volume was more than 49,800 strings.</p>
<p>Last winter, silver dollars were transported north to Dalian and transferred to various parts of the three northeastern provinces, which caused a stir in society. In fact, it was not surprising, but a normal state of trade. However, under the control of the Japanese, this kind of attention was paid. According to investigations, the amount exported to Dalian was no less than 30 million yuan during the winter. A certain British shipping company carried approximately 23 to 24 million yuan. There were great benefits to transporting and selling the silver coins. With the Shanghai silver tael falling, it was not difficult to profit from it. Over the years, 10 to 20 million have been transported out, but without the means to do so, and the majority of those transported were those of the 3rd year of the Republic.</p>

<h3 id="e199">A Review of the Yarn and Cotton Market Over the Past Year (3) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Market Conditions also peaked in the spring, at which time the old exchange transactions were settled and cleared together with cotton yarn, while there was still activity in spot cotton trading outside, because the yarn factories in the concession still had operations, but the Japanese yarn factories completely ceased operations. However, due to the impact of the incident, transportation on all routes was blocked, and sources of supply withered, so cotton prices suddenly became sharp. The spot price of Shaanxi cotton reached a maximum of thirty-five taels, and American cotton also reached 7.2 cents. After the war ceased and the Japanese army withdrew, American and Indian cotton, which had previously been transshipped, were successively re-shipped to Shanghai. The exchange also reopened for bidding on cotton on May 2nd. Because the standard for cotton yarn was changed to 20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn, the cotton standard was also changed to Zhengzhou fine staple cotton. On the opening day, the price was 32 taels. By mid-June, due to sluggish sales of American cotton, inventories reached 13,449,900 bales. The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce had 1.3 million bales of cotton in storage, and sold half of it, causing the market to plummet and reach an unprecedented low (falling to 5 US cents per pound upon entry). Shanghai was also in a state of financial contraction after the Japanese army's great robbery, yarn prices fell sharply, and yarn factories were shut down for as long as three or four months. The outlet for cotton turned sluggish again. Once the weakness was exposed, violent fluctuations followed one after another. Last year (1932), there were major floods in various provinces, and cotton merchants were deeply concerned that cotton production would be affected, so they ordered a large amount of foreign cotton. When it arrived, there was a lot of accumulated stock, and there was no intention to import more domestic cotton. As a result, the prices of Lu and Yu cotton all fell sharply. The inventory in Tianjin was very large, and the price of Xihe cotton fell even more severely. The financial sector suffered losses, and many cotton merchants went bankrupt. Bad news came frequently from all directions, and short sellers became increasingly active. The state of panic in the market was indescribable. At the same time, a major crisis occurred at the Ningbo Yao Cotton Exchange. There were only sell orders and no buy orders at the opening. For a time, the situation was deadlocked. With the intervention of the authorities, the cotton was temporarily accepted and efforts were made to sell it in Shanghai. As the saying goes, "when it rains, it pours." In July, the lowest record in recent years was found in the bidding for cotton: 27 taels (converted to 25.2 taels using the old standard). Just when things were at their worst, news suddenly came from overseas that American cotton fields had been damaged due to climate change, excessive rainfall, and increasingly serious insect infestations. A surge in prices suddenly occurred. On August 8, the US government estimated that the crop would be one million bales less than expected, at 11.306 million bales, a jump of 85 points. The price soared from 6 cents to 9.2 cents, approaching the 10-cent mark. The highest price for standard cotton in Shanghai reached 35.7 taels. A certain manufacturer made a large number of sales in the futures and spot markets, with a short position of 230,000 to 240,000 dan, accounting for two-thirds of the market, putting especially heavy pressure on prices. Unexpectedly, the second estimate of American cotton (announced on September 8) plummeted by more than 100 points. The world cotton market was shaken and fell sharply, like a bolt from the blue. The price of standard cotton fell by 1.7 or 1.8 taels. American cotton then slowly declined. The reason for the sharp decline was that the weather improved, production gradually increased, and the economies of Europe and the United States were sluggish, reducing consumption. In the last period, December 8, production increased to 12,727,000 bales, and the spot price fell directly from 9.2 cents in August to 5.7 cents in early December. The cotton market in Shanghai was completely shattered. Liang cotton fell from 35.7 taels in August to 29.75 taels in early November. However, domestic cotton in November, due to the soaring gold price, found a new high price of more than 830 taels. It was not feasible to calculate the price of foreign cotton coming to Shanghai, and there was a shortage of goods arriving in Shanghai from all over the country. Speculative shops actively purchased cotton. Moreover, there was excessive rainfall in the north, and the Yellow River burst its banks, flooding the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, causing heavy damage to cotton fields. Production was estimated to decrease from 10,829,162 dan to 8,094,863 dan. This was indeed the biggest reason for the rise in domestic cotton prices. Therefore, at the end of the year, the price of standard cotton reached 34.65 taels again. A list of the high and low delivery prices and total transaction volume of Zhengzhou standard cotton over the year is provided below.</p>

<p>(Note 3) The price of standard cotton in January 1932 was based on 16-count yarn raw cotton coarse lint. From May onwards, it was changed to 20-count yarn as the standard. Therefore, standard cotton also included Zhengzhou fine staple cotton.</p>
<p>(Note 4) Items marked with × are recent (July) prices.</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation, although there was a rise in the spring due to insufficient supply, soon subsided due to sluggish yarn sales. Since entering the summer season, the new cotton situation has been good. There is a rumor that the factories in Shanghai have borrowed 500,000 bales of American cotton on credit. The yarn factories once convened a meeting, but it did not materialize due to conditional relationships. In the autumn, American cotton experienced a sharp rise due to insect infestations. Domestic cotton had a period of brisk sales. Huoji cotton rose from 27 taels in June to 33 taels in August. Shaanxi cotton rose from 27.5 taels to 35 taels. At that time, Japanese factories absorbed more than 100,000 dan of Huoji cotton futures at a price of about 34-35 taels. Chinese factories purchased less. Unexpectedly, the second estimate of American cotton brought about unexpected changes, and spot cotton trading suddenly became cold. 100,000 dan of Huoji cotton purchased by Japanese factories were valued at 32 taels, but the settlement was not accepted. The market suddenly had this large amount of spot goods. In October, the price of Huoji cotton fell back to 28.25 taels. At that time, the bullish and bearish sides in the exchange were fiercely competing. Wing On Factory decided to purchase and take delivery, while Shenxin bought spot and delivered goods. The delivery volume was 50,600 dan, which was the largest amount in a year.</p>
<p>In December, a sudden rise in the cotton market in Shanghai made the situation particularly tense, and there was talk of a squeeze. The reason for this was said to be that a certain factory had too large a short position and did not have the capacity to deliver enough goods. Moreover, the price of gold was trending upwards, and it was difficult to calculate the price of foreign cotton coming to Shanghai in silver. Domestic textiles had to purchase domestic cotton for use, and domestic cotton sales were bound to be less sluggish than in the previous year. This was the biggest boost to the cotton market. As a result, general speculators rushed to buy, and the market rose. Japanese merchants were particularly active in purchasing spot cotton in the market. The spot price of Shaanxi cotton rose from 31 taels to 33-34 taels. However, the world cotton industry was still in an era of oversupply. The total production of American cotton, including carryover from the previous year, was 26,176,000 bales, while the worldwide consumption was only about 12.5 to 13 million bales. China's production was better than last year (according to the China Cotton Production Improvement Association, it was estimated to be more than 8 million dan). China has more than 4 million spindles, and the annual consumption of raw cotton requires more than 8 or 9 million dan, which it can supply itself. Moreover, the yarn market is in a sluggish state, and factories purchase raw materials as they use them. Judging from the overall situation, there is still no active upward momentum in the future. The high and low prices of spot cotton transactions throughout the year are listed below for reference (the market was closed in February due to the Japanese invasion of Shanghai; unit: taels).</p>
<p>Foreign cotton imports date back decades, but at that time the quantity was small and the value was no more than ten thousand taels. In the late Guangxu period, with the development of the yarn factory business, foreign cotton imports also increased day by day. However, at that time, the people were simple and unadorned, and coarse cloth clothing was sufficient to satisfy their desires, and there was no need for fine staple cotton. Later, there was a growing demand for fine staple cotton, and the call for promoting American cotton became louder. However, due to political, personnel, climate, land, and other factors, more than 30 years have passed, and the results of improving cotton varieties are clear but insignificant. Habits have also become increasingly extravagant. In the past, coarse cloth clothing was considered sufficient, but now it is difficult to satisfy desires without fine cloth or mercerized cloth. As a result, the value of American cotton and other imports has been more than ten million taels since 1920. In 1931, due to the vigorous purchase of foreign cotton by various factories, the import value and foreign rice firmly ranked first. Even yarn and cotton had to be raised to the standard of 20-count yarn and fine staple cotton. A higher standard of living is not necessarily a bad thing, but seeking everything from abroad and the country's agricultural production are closely affected by foreign goods, unable to maintain their position. Whether it is rice or cotton, there is no exception. As a result, it seems that we will gain nothing and will have to rely on foreign countries. The national economy and the people's livelihood are only shrinking and not prosperous. Without war, we can already be subdued. The cotton prices in foreign cotton markets are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Sorrow of a Prodigal Son <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>– Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Zheng Guoyou, the mastermind behind the assassination of Feng Deqian, was tried more than ten times in Hong Kong. Although he hired many foreign lawyers who eloquently defended him in court, he could not escape the special provision of "a murderer must die" and was eventually sentenced to death. A rich man's son with huge sums of money could not prolong his life after all, which is the sorrow of a prodigal son! Zheng Guoyou was the grandson of the late Nanyang Kapitan Zheng Gui. Zheng Gui resided in Perak, Malaysia, and, under the guidance of foreigners, made great contributions to the construction of the opening and closing of Perak, thus becoming a great wealthy man. After becoming rich, he was able to work hard on public welfare affairs and had a good reputation among the overseas Chinese. After Zheng Gui died, his son Jing Tang, that is, Zheng Guoyou's father, also passed away one after another. At this time, Zheng Guoyou was only six years old and became an orphan without ancestors or father. This situation was described by 240 Hong Kong gentlemen and merchants, including Huang Guangtian, in a joint petition, begging the Hong Kong Governor to spare his death. However, the Legislative Council refused the joint petition of the gentlemen and merchants, and could not exempt the death penalty of the unfilial grandson because of the merits of his grandfather. This is the sorrow of a prodigal son!</p>
<p>Zheng's mother went to visit him in prison two weeks ago. Zheng Guoyou had completely changed his former arrogant state, suppressed his grief, and comforted his mother kindly, saying, "In prison, your son has a mattress to sleep on and fish to eat. I hope mother can rest assured." Zheng's mother said with tears in her eyes, "My son is accustomed to being pampered. Now, it is not like being at home. Even if there is no white rice, you have to swallow even burnt rice." Guoyou bowed his head and accepted his fate, tears streaming down his face, which is the sorrow of a prodigal son.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong merchants' joint petition was written by Lai Biao Xi, a former Hanlin scholar of the Qing Dynasty, which contained a passage saying, "Zheng Guoyou was only six years old when he had no strict father to guide him, and he inherited a huge family fortune. His mother was a widow and had no time to teach him about his character or control his actions. As he grew older, his desires gradually opened up. Relying on his wealth, he violated the norms, indulged in irregular entertainment, and made friends with improper and promiscuous friends." He thoroughly described the situation of Guoyou's lack of education, which is the sorrow of a prodigal son!</p>
<p>According to recent news from Hong Kong, the Legislative Council finally complied with the request of the gentlemen and merchants and changed Zheng Guoyou's sentence to life imprisonment. Perhaps, Hanlin Lai's writing had some effect. The petition stated, "A weak young man, ignorant and unknowing, possessed wealth and was coveted by villains who set traps to lure and confuse him, leading to his imprisonment. He is truly pitiful," and so on, achieving a considerable effect. However, what is the difference between life imprisonment and death? Moreover, there is endless suffering, which is the sorrow of a prodigal son!</p>

<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>｜Retracing the Resistance Against Japanese Pirates｜</p>
<p>After the snow cleared, I thought of the winds and clouds over Yuguan Pass. Coincidentally, a letter arrived from Tan Yaosheng in Chaoyang, saying that Japanese planes had not come for three months. Now, due to the urgent invasion, they are circling again, the situation resembling Suzhou on this day last year. When can we wield the spear of Lu Yang? The more I think about it, the more troubled I become! I happened to read "Random Talks from the Mountains and Seas," recalling the Ming Jiajing era's resistance against Japanese pirates. Devouring a large piece of meat at the butcher's door, I felt a brief moment of satisfaction. "Random Talks" was written by Ren Huan of Changzhou, Ming Dynasty. He rose through the ranks from Jinshi to Deputy Prefect of Suzhou, fighting the Japanese pirates in over one hundred and ten battles, beheading over fifty thousand enemies, and protecting more than twenty cities. One year, Japanese pirates attacked Suzhou, and the city gates were closed during the day, with the people wailing around the city. Ren Huan admitted them during the day, saving tens of thousands of lives. When Japanese pirates seized civilian boats to escape to sea, Ren Huan intercepted them at Maji Mountain, burning those entrenched in Jiading to death. Later generations only know of Qi Jiguang's merit in resisting Japanese pirates, unaware that Ren Huan was the mainstay, like Fang Zhaoyuan to the 19th Route Army. Yet, Ren Huan was but a scholar, truly remarkable. In "Random Talks," there is a "Reduced Character Magnolia Flower" poem about Wusong: "Tossing and turning, when will the incessant autumn rain cease? Warships on the river, charging through the waves for half a year. The ominous atmosphere has not been swept away, and sorrow makes me feel my age. Holding a sword in the west wind, singing慷慨悲歌in wine." Its mournful courage is no less than Yue Wu Mu's "Man Jiang Hong." Other lines include: "The pirate's lair is clearly exterminated, and peace is once again seen in the southeast." "Cultivating oneself is the duty of a man; do not let this turban be worn in vain." "Ten thousand men learning to fight the enemy is futile; only mental strength can defeat the enemy." "With a three-foot sword and ten thousand scrolls, where can a man not make his home?" Reading it fills one with vigor. During his time, poets wrote in praise of him, such as Gui Youguang's "Ren Gong has personally killed the enemy." "Even children know Deputy Administrator Ren, standing tall as a golden city on the sea." Wen Zhengming's "Barbarians from the east suddenly shocked us, but the magistrate's benevolence and martial prowess form a great wall." Tang Shunzhi's "The enemy fears him like Fan and Han, and overseas they call him Lord Ren." Wen Yuan's "Sails brushing Fusang frighten the barbarian lands, and his awe-inspiring presence makes him a heroic general." Wang Guxiang's "How many scholar-generals have been praised throughout history? He truly has armor and weapons in his mind." All highly praised him. Today, reaching Mudu and Pingwang, seeing the perilous watchtowers, one can still imagine the heroic and bloody battles of the martyrs. Four hundred years later, Shanghai and Songhu are once again ravaged, how would Ren Gong feel if he knew? I believe that such texts full of courage and spirit should be made for young students to write ten thousand times and recite a thousand times.</p>

<p>｜A Corner of the Human Flesh Market｜</p>
<p>The city is a paradise built upon sin. The appearance of the city is prosperity, the blood of the city is money, and the inner core of the city is carnal desire. Shanghai is such a paradise built upon sin.</p>
<p>Last night, I stepped onto North Sichuan Road, which had been trampled by the Japanese iron hooves. The once luxurious and mysterious street gradually revived after the calamity. When passing the Sichuan Road Bridge, looking north, one can see the streetlights shimmering like a fire dragon. On the smooth asphalt road,</p>

<h3 id="e209">Hometown <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Tiwei</p>
<p>So, after the prescription was finalized, he immediately sent the long-term worker to a place hundreds of miles away to collect the medicine. Meanwhile, Hongye's brother hurried to a friend's place five miles away to borrow opium paraphernalia because Dr. X liked to smoke a couple of pipes. Father also seemed a little happier, specifically instructing them to order a lavish meal and invite old man Zhang from next door to keep Dr. X company and wash away the dust.</p>
<p>The next day, the doctor left, and the medicine was collected. Just a pair of geckos cost twenty-two dollars. Hongye and her brother personally unpacked the medicine and brewed it carefully, watching the charcoal fire vigilantly. It seemed as if their father's life depended on that small pair of geckos.</p>
<p>After taking three doses, it seemed that the swelling had subsided a little, and Dr. X came again.</p>
<p>"How is it? I said I was confident in treating your father's illness. But fortunately, we caught it early, otherwise, even I would have been helpless. Based on the current situation, after taking about ten doses, the swelling should completely subside."</p>
<p>He wrote five more prescriptions and then stopped. One prescription included velvet antler slices, which had to be obtained from H City.</p>
<p>"This velvet antler is very expensive. It's best if you buy a whole one and slice it yourselves, it will be more cost-effective. Take two hundred dollars with you, that should be enough."</p>
<p>Hongye's brother knew that velvet antler was the most potent thing and wondered if it was suitable to eat. After consulting their father, the result was, "Don't doubt the person you employ, and don't doubt what they prescribe." Following his instructions, they prepared and ate it. Surprisingly, it didn't seem to worsen things, but it didn't get better either.</p>
<p>Dr. X's third act took a complete turn on the opium couch and became increasingly reckless.</p>
<p>"Your father has trouble sleeping at night, it's because his heart and kidneys are not in harmony. Playing with a couple of puffs of this stuff is the most effective treatment, isn't it?"</p>
<p>After a secret meeting between the Hong siblings and their mother, they unanimously agreed that this panacea, not found in any herbal, was feasible. However, knowing that this was something their father deeply hated in his life, they weren't sure if he would break his principles and could only tentatively mention it. As expected, their mother was immediately rebuffed, and their father even scolded the flamboyant Dr. X behind his back. The Hong siblings were so frightened that they dared not speak again.</p>
<p>But at the same time, many people who came to visit their father asked in unison, "Have you tried smoking opium yet?" (5)</p>
<p>Flowing with vehicles, bustling with people.</p>
<p>What I am now exposing is a corner of carnal desire in the city. Such expressions are common in the city. From this, it can be seen that under the oppressed joy lies the misery of many Chinese women who have been corrupted by the social environment, being insulted and trampled upon by foreign beasts in their brutality.</p>
<p>In a coffee shop, right in the middle of North Sichuan Road's showcase from Bazilu to Qiujiang Road, there is an advertisement for red lanterns outside. Inside this coffee shop, besides a few waitresses wearing white vests, there are seven or eight women dressed in colorful clothes. Although their figures are not quite as slender and graceful as urban women, they are all very young. Their faces are covered in powder like plastered walls, and their lipstick is like basins of blood. Some have southern accents, some have northern accents. A woman in her forties leads them. This group specializes in serving foreign guests and soldiers. They seem like a moving machine. When they receive customers, they go with them to secret locations rented by the coffee shop owner on Bazilu to engage in the performance in the fiery pit. The price they receive is about ten dollars, which is split between the coffee shop owner and the procuress-like woman in a ratio of four to six. Several of them already have the smell of sulfur. They are constantly being insulted and trampled upon by foreigners, day after day. Some entertain more than one man each night, and some drunken sailors gang-rape one woman. Ah, it's all for being sold to earn money for the procuress and the coffee shop owner. This place is filled with bloodshed and devoid of light, completely dark, cruel, and reminiscent of a human flesh market-like hell.</p>
<p>Ah, this corner of sin formed in the urban background, I hope the torch of justice and humanity will illuminate it, so that it doesn't remain in darkness forever, and so that these suffering women don't always sink into depravity!</p>
<p>This is what I hope for! This is why I wrote it down.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Radio Drama <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>｜A New Perspective｜</p>
<p>Stage plays have sound and color, while silver screen plays have color but no sound (except for "talkies"). Radio dramas, on the other hand, have sound but no color, specifically for entertainment on the radio. The writing of the script differs greatly among the three. Stage plays can accommodate everything: scenery, music, expressions, dialogue, singing, and martial arts. Silver screen plays are slightly different. The script does not necessarily require dialogue from the characters. The plot and emotional appeal can be understood simply by watching the image. Therefore, those who oppose talkies often criticize them as unnecessary. Radio drama scripts are often short plays, suitable for about half an hour. The cast is three or four people, or five or six people. In addition to dialogue, the sounds of animals and objects are all included. In foreign countries, there are many such dramas on the radio. Although radio in China was once very popular, such dramas are still lacking. Recently, Xu Zhuodai has compiled and performed a play for four factories, including the Family Industrial Cooperative, at the Yongsheng Company radio station on December 26, which is truly a groundbreaking initiative. In the future, imitators will surely follow. The actors this time include painter Tao Zhongcheng and five or six others, while the original author of the play is Wang Zhongxian. At the same time, there is also a speech by Yan Duhe, complementing each other. The 28th is the anniversary of the January 28 Incident, so Xu Zhuodai will give a speech about the situation of fleeing Jiangwan at that time, which is said to be extremely poignant.</p>
<p>Local Customs</p>
<h3 id="e211">Suzhou at the Start and End of the Old Lunar Year <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Although the Gregorian calendar has been used for quite some time, due to the continued customs of the people, the authority of the lunar calendar still holds the upper hand. Over the past twenty-two years, it has turned into a situation where yin prevails over yang. Taking Suzhou as an example, the Gregorian New Year only sees schools and government offices taking a few days off, just a formality. In society, it is still like dealing with the Northeast issue, always in a state of calm. But when it comes to the Lunar New Year, there is a big change. The following notes are about the scenes of Suzhou at the beginning and end of the old lunar year.</p>
<p>㈠ Families at the End of the Year</p>
<p>Dusting the Eaves: In Suzhou, whether it's a small family or a large household, at the end of each year, they must first have a thorough cleaning of the dust in the house. From the beams to the corners of the walls, everything is cleaned, called "Dusting the Eaves." There is a saying in Suzhou, "Before accomplishing anything, first dust the eaves," because dusting the eaves is the first task of passing the year. The days are chosen according to the water days on the almanac, taking the meaning of avoiding fire. Sending off the Kitchen God and Thanking the Year: Eating is indeed a major difficulty in life! Therefore, the Kitchen God, who governs the kitchen, receives the highest respect from old families. On the 23rd and 24th days of the lunar year, it is the day for the Kitchen God to ascend to Heaven to report the good and bad deeds of each family. In Suzhou, on these two days, every family prepares paper sedan chairs, sets up vegetarian feasts, and respectfully sends off the Kitchen God to Heaven. On the feast for sending off the Kitchen God, a candy ingot must be offered. The Kitchen God, after eating the sweet treat, will only say good things when reporting. This ridiculous superstitious act is still preserved in Suzhou society. As for thanking the year, it involves preparing chicken, fish, and three kinds of sacrifices, offering them to the gods to express gratitude. The date for thanking the year is either fixed every year or chosen according to an auspicious day on the almanac. The scroll with the image of the gods is also hung in the hall on the day of thanking the year.</p>
<p>New Year's Eve Dinner: After worshiping the ancestors, the full dishes invite relatives and friends, surrounding family members, and enjoying the feast. During the feast, dishes are passed around, and auspicious words are spoken. For example, fish is said to mean "abundance," bamboo shoots mean "rising steadily," shrimp mean "smooth sailing," chicken means "growing vigorously," oranges mean "round fortune," vermicelli means "golden chains," and green fruits, ark clams, egg dumplings, etc., are all commonly called "earning ingots." And at the bottom of each bowl of rice, a cooked water chestnut is hidden, called digging for treasure, meaning digging for hidden wealth. The meal is eaten at night, called New Year's Eve Dinner.</p>
<p>Sealing the Well and Welcoming the Kitchen God: On Lunar New Year's Eve, every family, because the old Kitchen God has ascended to Heaven and the kitchen cannot be vacant forever, the new Kitchen God takes office at the end of the year. At the same time, the well is sealed, and the Well Spring Boy, who represents water (homophone for power), is worshiped. Then, firecrackers are set off to seal the door, carrying out the ancient saying "With the sound of firecrackers, the old is removed."</p>
<p>㈡ Society at the End of the Year</p>
<p>Storytelling Sessions: Storytelling is Suzhou people's specialty of "speaking with a single mouth." Ma Rufei and Liu Jingting were certainly well-known figures in the past, and Guangyu Society is also a powerful modern folk organization in Suzhou. Storytelling sessions take place at the end of each year. At each storytelling venue, four or five storytellers take turns performing. The stories told at the sessions emphasize humor. If a storyteller is good, the listeners laugh heartily, and their reputation spreads by word of mouth. But those with poor elocution, due to the number of people telling stories at the sessions, often face the embarrassment of being booed off the stage, so many are not counted. As for the proceeds from the sessions, the storytellers only take 200 copper coins. Half of the remainder goes to the teahouses, and the other half goes to the annual expenses of the Storytelling Association and Yucai Elementary School.</p>
<p>Sending Ingots: When the teahouses and bathhouses reach the end of the year, the waiters send a small bag of olives and a few oranges, called sending ingots, to their regular customers. The recipient must give at least one yuan in return. At the same time, the prices at bathhouses and barbershops double after the 24th, compared to normal days.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends: At the end of the year, the rice cake and tea snack shops pile up rice cakes like small mountains, and nandina and wintersweet are also sold as New Year's offerings. Groups of beggars dress up as turtles and yellow cattle, going around the streets begging for money. Under the electric lights on New Year's Eve, people can still be found carrying lanterns, collecting debts.</p>

<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Written for the Anniversary of the January 28 Incident</p>
<p>The enemy's prepared second general offensive is about to erupt in a day or two. The situation has become even more serious. The new commander-in-chief sent from Tokyo has also arrived. The naval landing forces, which were boasted about in peacetime, are now suffering unexpected blows from the Chinese troops every day and have increased many elite land forces. Every day, countless stories are heard of Japanese soldiers massacring Chinese civilians. Several hundred people were captured, imprisoned in houses, and whipped, some starving while being forced to do hard labor for them.</p>
<p>Recently, it has become even more difficult to walk on the roads. San De and his friends can no longer risk selling newspapers every day to earn a few copper coins. They have already discussed with the familiar soldiers nearby that as long as each of them gets the firearms and other items of the brothers who died on the spot, they can stand on the front line and fight alongside the troops. At this moment, they can't care about the roster and other things, aiming their guns at the imperialists is all that matters.</p>
<p>San De, Dafa, and Agen learned that there probably wouldn't be any battles on this road tonight, so they joined the team at dusk and really found an opportunity to get everything sorted out with their familiar friends. About half of this group of people have been injured or killed since the beginning of the war. Every face shows signs of exhaustion, but they are still excited and energetic. They only sleep for two or three hours a day, but no one says they are tired. They immediately wake up as soon as they hear the enemy's gunfire.</p>
<p>Several partners taught them how to load and fire the guns and also taught them the experience of how to throw grenades.</p>
<p>"Killing people is so easy!" Zhou Sanbao said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Killing people is easy, but orders are not easy. We only hear about Japanese imperialists issuing general attack orders one after another, but it's really difficult for us to get an attack order! When we encircled the enemy the day before yesterday, we could have messed them up completely, but we were ordered not to rush over, right Lao Zhou? The regimental commander was also a little angry, but he knew that it wouldn't work if the brothers under him made a fuss, and in the end, he would still suffer from the higher-ups, so he learned his lesson last time and obeyed the order. We really hate it. The enemy that was clearly surrounded was so anxious that they couldn't think of a way, their left wing suffered such a big loss, and the whole army would be panicked, but we let them go so easily!"</p>
<p>"We later asked the regimental commander in private, and he had to say that it was because of the overall military plan, and there was no way to think about it. Damn it!"</p>
<p>It was quite dark before dinner was delivered.</p>
<p>"Hey, Wang Baolin, why is dinner delivered so late? How many meals do you eat a day?" Dafa asked the flat-faced man next to him. His stomach, which had been hungry for two days, grumbled especially loudly when he saw the rice.</p>
<p>"They're afraid to send it during the day because of the planes. We eat dinner at this time, and breakfast will be delivered before dawn."</p>
<p>Everyone filled their bowls tightly and quickly swallowed the rice with a little bit of vegetables. Just as everyone was eating their second bowl, the sound of rifles and machine guns clearly erupted. The three of them, who had just stepped onto the front line, immediately stopped eating and asked their other partners. Zhou Sanbao told them that the sound wasn't from the enemy in front of them and that it wasn't a formal battle either. This kind of situation often happens, but it's just the enemy testing the waters.</p>
<p>Not long after dinner, because they expected that there wouldn't be much fighting tonight and they were preparing to deal with the second general offensive that was coming soon, the company commander ordered everyone to go to bed early. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>In ancient times, being a woman was terribly unlucky. Every move was wrong, this was scolded, that was scolded. Now, this misfortune has fallen on the students' heads. Advancing is scolded, retreating is scolded.</p>
<p>We still remember how the students stirred up trouble since the winter of the year before last. Some wanted to go south, some wanted to go north. They were not allowed to board the trains going south or north. By the time they reached the capital and petitioned on their knees, they unexpectedly were "used by the reactionaries." Many heads happened to "bump" into bayonets and rifle butts, and some even "accidentally fell into the water" and died.</p>
<p>Who dared to raise a protest? Some people even laughed and scolded them.</p>
<p>They were also expelled, their parents were notified, and they were urged to advance to the research institutes. A year has passed, and finally things have quieted down. But unexpectedly, Shanhaiguan has fallen. Shanghai is still far away, but Beiping is no longer safe because even the research institutes are in danger. People living in Shanghai must remember, could they still sit in the research institutes of Jinan University and Labor University on this day last year?</p>
<p>The university students in Beiping know this, and they have a good memory. This time, they no longer use their heads to "bump" into bayonets and rifle butts, nor do they want to "accidentally fall into the water." Instead, they invented a new method, which is to scatter and go home.</p>
<p>This is precisely the effect of the education in recent years.</p>
<p>But then again, someone came to scold them. The Boy Scouts are still in the elegies of the martyrs, saying that they "leave a stench for ten thousand years."</p>
<p>But let us think about it: aren't even the inanimate antiques in the Institute of Linguistics and History being moved? Isn't it true that students cannot each have an airplane? Can those who can get dazed from bumping into native bayonets and rifle butts and hide in the research institutes be unaffected by the foreign airplanes and cannons bombing them out of the research institutes?</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>｜Speaking at the Shanghai Literary and Art Tea Party｜</p>
<p>Distinguished gentlemen and ladies:</p>
<p>Mr. ×× wants me to talk about my views on literature and art! Literature and art are such noble things that we country folk cannot talk about them.</p>
<p>Just now, Mr. Sun Fuxi talked about plum blossoms and then orchids, saying that orchids grow in deep mountains and that their fragrance moves people, saying how those who pick orchids cut through thorns, enter deep valleys, climb dangerous cliffs, and face all kinds of hardships before they can pick them, saying how beauties and fragrant herbs are praised in the poems of ancient and modern scholars, and also talking about the orchids' solitary appreciation of their own beauty, as noble as the artists and writers who love beauty.</p>
<p>I am sorry! We country folk didn't know that orchids were so noble. Just a hundred steps from my house, on a low mountain ridge, there are many orchids in those thatched nests. They are picked in handfuls and baskets. In the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, dozens of plants can be found. I never entered any deep valleys or climbed any dangerous cliffs. Twenty years ago, when I was studying in Jinhua, I saw orchids being sold for 240 cash per load and found it very strange. Who knew that orchids had such a noble status? I am truly very sorry!</p>
<p>After praising plum blossoms, you have to praise orchids. After praising orchids, you have to praise peonies and herbaceous peonies. Artists and writers in spring are truly as busy as a thousand or ten thousand every day! We country folk, after seeing the rapeseed flowers, the azaleas on the mountains are blooming vigorously, filling the mountains and valleys, one after another, and there are always thirty days to see. After seeing the azaleas, the clover flowers fill the fields, and they are also very lively. Spring is a busy time for farm work, and there is never time to praise them, but they still bloom vigorously every year!</p>
<p>I heard that in wealthy families in the city, they always raise three or five Pekingese, and in front of the steps, they always place a few pots of orchids. This is indeed a well-matched pairing, winning the hearts of young ladies, young masters, masters, and madams.</p>
<p>Please forgive us country folk for not understanding the merits of these two noble treasures.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Shrimp, Eel, and Others <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Jiahuang</p>
<p>All living beings have their own ways of life and instincts to resist external aggression. Some fight with horns, tigers and leopards with claws and teeth, mules and horses with hooves, and those without weapons rely on protection to avoid enemy attacks. For example, cabbage worms are all green, hiding in cabbage leaves, making it difficult for enemies to detect them. Like cuttlefish, when they sense a life-threatening danger, they eject ink, hiding in the ink, making it difficult for enemies to recognize them. Other, weaker lower organisms rely on great reproductive power to maintain the continuation of the race, such as mayflies, bedbugs, and lice. Although they live in the morning and die in the evening, although they are constantly captured by people, they always have the opportunity to coexist and prosper with humans!</p>
<p>I remember it was the Mid-Autumn Festival last year when my wife bought shrimp and eel. At that time, I was in Ningbo, which was not suffering from any "national crisis", and I thought that the shrimp and eel in Ningbo would also be free from "national crisis." Originally, humans are strong, the kings of animals, eating pork, eating beef, killing chickens and cooking lamb—these are common occurrences. I was also bored and paid attention to these animals, which would soon enter my mouth. The shrimp jumped in the basket, then squirmed in the bucket. I thought, no matter how much they jumped and twisted, since they had been caught and bought from the fishmonger, they would not survive, and this jumping and twisting was obviously meaningless. However, even though they are small creatures destined to die, in this time of crisis and survival, they always know to jump and twist, making their enemies who kill them spend more effort and feel annoyed and bothered!</p>
<p>Shrimp can only jump clumsily and are relatively easy to deal with, so I only paid attention to how my wife killed the eel. She was an amateur at killing eel. She had no way to catch the slippery eel. She wanted to scald them to death with boiling water and then cut them open. I said this method of killing was too stupid, and there would be no fresh, bloody taste when eating it. She wanted to flatten the eel's head so that there would be blood and freshness, but as she hit it, the eel slipped and danced like a dragon or snake. I told her, "Why don't you anesthetize the eel with wine!" Sure enough, when the wine was poured into the bucket, the eel's mouth moved a few times, and then it looked like it was dead. After a while, all these animals were taken care of. I laughed at my wife, "Haha, you're also a third-rate imperialist!"</p>
<p>I used to kill eel in the countryside, which was done by brute force. I would just grab its head, make a cut from the side of its head with small scissors, break open its belly, and pull out its intestines. But even without its internal organs, the animal would still struggle. I also killed frogs, cut off their heads, skinned them, cut off their limbs, opened their bellies, and took out their livers and lungs, but when thrown into a basin of water, they could still jump and swim. However, it was strange to have actions without painful cries! In short, for such animals to struggle so hard when there is no need to struggle is really too stupid and meaningless!</p>
<p>After all, humans, especially humans from the land of China, are more refined and intelligent. Before being caught and skinned, they don't jump or twist, and they lead each other, refraining from jumping or twisting together. After the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, the anniversaries had long passed, and amidst "having our own ways" of "long-term resistance" and "psychological resistance," the enemy had invaded Shanhaiguan. Although fierce bombs were thrown at the hot-blooded youth who were good at picking and twisting, they still did not jump or twist. Because what's the use? What's the meaning? Sooner or later, they will be skinned like shrimp and eel! Besides, it was investigated clearly ten years ago that there are 450 million humans in the land of China. You can skin them as you please. With our great reproductive power, we won't be wiped out in three to five years.</p>

<p>They also talked about the church. After hearing Pastor Habah's brief sermon, it was time to sing again, and Cao Shiguang hurried toward the crowd. As he walked, he said with a smile,</p>
<p>"Old Lin, please come to my house when you have time. Bring your Sweetheart along too."</p>
<p>"......Carrying the grain home, carrying the grain home! We are very happy, bringing the grain home!......"</p>
<p>Haiquan said, "Let's go," and they left the crowd listening to the song.</p>
<p>"Is that Mr. Cao a good friend of yours?"</p>
<p>"Just a fellow townsman."</p>
<p>"What does he do at the church?"</p>
<p>"He's a small clerk, I guess. A monthly salary of thirty dollars!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Cao is so unkind...."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Didn't he say I was yours...? Oh, I'm so embarrassed!"</p>
<p>Her cheeks were really flushed, turning red down to her cute ears.</p>
<p>"Let him say what he wants. When he knows what kind of person you are, he'll start spreading rumors again. It wouldn't be good if it gets out."</p>
<p>They walked silently for a moment.</p>
<p>"Let's go back; this is pointless."</p>
<p>"Then shall we go see a play?"</p>
<p>"It's not time yet."</p>
<p>"Let's have a quick meal at a restaurant and then go see a play."</p>
<p>"Let's go back."</p>
<p>He said, yawning.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, do you dislike me that much?"</p>
<p>Their eyes met again, and they grinned at each other for a moment.</p>
<p>Twenty-Two</p>
<p>Deciding to have dinner at the T Tea House on the main street, Haiquan and Mrs. Hezi got off the tram in front of the New World. Haiquan was unusually vigilant, afraid of running into classmates or fellow townsmen who knew him and Mrs. Hezi. That's why he didn't approve of getting off in front of the big companies, preferring to walk a few more steps. Although she found it a bit cold, Mrs. Hezi agreed.</p>
<p>Looking east, the great city of Shanghai was already shrouded in the night of late winter. The colored electric lights of the rooftop gardens of the three major companies were particularly bright, shining through the gray-white night fog. Looking toward the riverbank, the perspective gradually turned to sand, the urban night scene, sharpened to a point, intermittently decorated with red and blue neon lights, creating a unique miniature. But standing in the cold wind and looking at the degenerate urban lights, Haiquan was overcome by a wave of sorrow. He sighed almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry," I've tired you out like this, Mr. Lin, Mrs. Hezi leaned slightly toward his left shoulder, her face close to his.</p>
<p>"No. Don't worry about it. I was just looking at the unique scene of this chaotic city and couldn't help but feel a bit sentimental. Seriously thinking about it, what is life really for!"</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The word "experience" occupies an important position in Chinese social thought. Speaking requires experience, doing things requires experience, and emphasizing experience over experimentation has almost become a characteristic of the Chinese people!</p>
<p>Experience and truth go hand in hand. Experience derived from truth is most worthy of cherishing, but experience that is unrelated to or even contrary to truth is not only useless but also harmful! It should be understood that experience is not a bad thing in itself; its benefits or harms depend entirely on whether the user uses it well. Does medicine not value experience? The foundation of medicine is built on science, and the first principle of science is experimentation. Truth is the crystallization of experimentation, and the experience of new medicine is based on experimentation. It can also be said that it is the experience of truth. For example, experience tells us it is like this, but what is the result of experimentation? It is something else entirely, and then we immediately know that the report of experience is completely wrong! Old medicine has two types of experience: one is based on predecessors, and the other belongs to oneself. What medicine to use for what disease, predecessors did it this way, and later generations can do it this way too. Predecessors obtained it from experience, and the experience of predecessors, left to later generations, becomes truth. Later generations only know to silently adhere to the truth derived from the experience of predecessors, without asking whether this principle is true or not. This is the secret of old medicine's treatment of diseases—it is also the biggest reason why old medicine has remained unchanged for thousands of years in China. A's disease was cured like this, B's disease is the same as A's, so use the same treatment method. Day after day, the more similar diseases seen, the richer the experience becomes. But the reason why this treatment is necessary is never known. And thus, a strange phenomenon arises: what A doctor diagnoses is like this, what B doctor diagnoses is like that—what is the reason? It is because the methods they use are entirely based on experience. A doctor's experience is like this, B doctor's experience is like that, and the difference in treatment is the result of their experience. If we use experimental methods to examine and determine their right and wrong, perhaps we can say that both are wrong. This is one's own experience.</p>
<p>The condition of illness is ever-changing, and there are many cases of the same symptoms with different causes. A slight difference can lead to a great error. Experience can only tell us the generalities of the disease, but not what exactly the disease is or why it needs to be treated this way. Therefore, from experience, we can obtain a general range, and then conduct experiments in this direction to obtain truth. Compared to someone without experience conducting experiments, it can save time and energy. Conversely, if we rely solely on experience without conducting experiments, then at least some of this experience is unreliable, and using it to treat diseases is certainly dangerous.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that medicine is objective, and medical experience must be supplemented by experimentation. Experience derived from experimentation is truth.</p>

<p>(2) Influenza</p>
<p>Q: What is called influenza?</p>
<p>A: This is a very common infectious disease. Because the symptoms that appear are mostly the same as ordinary colds, but it often spreads widely, it is called influenza. But the actual confirmation may not be reliable.</p>
<p>Q: What is the Western name for influenza?</p>
<p>A: The Western names are Influenza or LaGrippe.</p>
<p>Q: In which year was this disease very widespread?</p>
<p>A: In 1918-20, there was a worldwide epidemic, which was then specifically called the Spanish Flu (Spanish Grippe).</p>
<p>Q: Is this disease found every year?</p>
<p>A: Yes, there are small local epidemics every winter.</p>
<p>Q: Can people who have had this disease become immune?</p>
<p>A: Although there is immunity, it is very short-lived, only about one or two months.</p>
<p>Q: What is the pathogen of influenza?</p>
<p>A: It is the influenza bacillus discovered by Pfeiffer. However, when the disease occurs, there are often mixed infections of pneumococci, staphylococci, streptococci, and Triedlander's bacilli.</p>
<p>Q: Which part of the body does the pathogen infect first?</p>
<p>A: It first infects the nasal passages and throat.</p>
<p>Q: How many days after being infected with this pathogen does the disease develop?</p>
<p>A: The disease develops in one to three days.</p>
<p>Q: When the disease develops, what are the most common first symptoms?</p>
<p>A: Sudden chills, fever, general fatigue, headache, forehead pain, limb pain, low back pain, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What are the later symptoms?</p>
<p>A: Usually, it is the mucosal inflammation type, mainly involving the respiratory system. That is, rhinitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, and tracheobronchitis. There is nasal discharge, throat pain, hoarseness, and coughing. There is compressive pain above and below the eye sockets.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a fever?</p>
<p>A: Yes, there is a fever. But the fever type is not fixed, usually between 39 and 40 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Q: Are there more dangerous symptoms?</p>
<p>A: There is a type that progresses very quickly, with a sudden rise in body temperature, rapid pulse, mental confusion, and can be fatal after three or four days. It is called fulminant influenza.</p>
<p>Q: Are there other types of the disease?</p>
<p>A: There are several other types. One is called the toxic type, which occurs about two or three weeks later, with another high fever leading to exhaustion. There is also a type that invades the lungs, called the pulmonary type, causing pneumonia. There is also a type that invades the gastrointestinal tract, called the gastrointestinal type, causing vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, and abdominal pain. Even more, there is a type that invades the nervous system, called the nervous type, causing encephalitis, meningitis, neuritis, and mental illness.</p>
<p>Q: Are there other complications in patients with influenza?</p>
<p>A: There are complications of conjunctivitis, otitis media, nephritis, pericarditis, peribronchitis, and sinus empyema.</p>
<p>Q: What is the treatment for this disease?</p>
<p>A: In the early stages of the disease, take diaphoretic drugs, such as aspirin, antipyrene, and phenacetin. In cases of sepsis, colloidal silver solution can be injected, or 606, etc. As for symptomatic treatment, take expectorants, cardiotonics, antitussives, and sedatives. Warm and moist compresses or anti-inflammatory clay poultices can be applied to the chest. If there is sinus empyema, surgical incision may be necessary.</p>

<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Early Diagnosis and the Results of Early Treatment</p>
<p>Although tuberculosis is a dreadful disease, if it can be diagnosed early and treated appropriately, there is no risk of it not being cured. However, in the early stages of the disease, people often do not pay close attention to it, and may even neglect it. When fever, hemoptysis, and other symptoms occur, they become flustered and confused. Although treatment may stop the fever and bleeding, they think that the disease is cured. However, tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and fever and hemoptysis are only one type or temporary phenomenon in the disease. Even if they occasionally subside, it does not mean that the disease is cured. Without the guidance of a doctor, without seeking to cultivate the body and increase resistance, the root of the disease will lie dormant, and the disease will eventually erupt one day, falling into a severe state. At this time, seeking medical attention is not entirely dependent on the power of medicine, and the proper treatment period has been lost, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The three stages of tuberculosis: The first is the latent period, which lasts from the time the tubercle bacillus invades the human body until the symptoms appear. The time can range from several months to one or two years, depending on each person's resistance and environment. The second is the symptomatic period, the length of which is uncertain, with some developing danger in a few days and others lasting for decades. The third is the early recovery period, which is when the patient has undergone treatment, has no subjective symptoms, and gradually recovers health.</p>
<p>If we can diagnose lung disease during its latent period and administer appropriate treatment, the results will be twice as effective with half the effort, avoiding the appearance of symptoms. However, diagnosis is quite difficult during the latent period, and patients are also unaware that they are ill, so there is no way to seek medical examination. Therefore, preparing for diagnosis during the latent period cannot be realized today. What we should pay attention to is</p>
<p>The early signs of tuberculosis: If your weight is gradually decreasing, you often feel tired when working, and coughing continues for one or two months or more, sometimes improving and sometimes recurring, and does not stop, or your appetite is poor, digestion is bad, or you have a slight fever in the afternoon, cold sweats on your chest or back when you wake up at night, or a small amount of blood streaks in your sputum, or coughing is worse in the morning and evening, and you cough up phlegm early in the morning, then you must immediately ask a doctor to examine your body to see if you have lung disease. At this time, the most important thing to avoid is neglecting the importance of X-rays and the discovery of early infiltration. Early diagnosis of lung disease is the first problem to be solved in the treatment of lung disease. However, in the early stages of the disease, the symptoms are extremely subtle. If we use the old Chinese diagnostic methods, such as "observation, inquiry, auscultation, and palpation" to make an accurate diagnosis, it is impossible. The clever ones often write the four words "beware of lung disease" in the pulse record, just to fulfill their responsibility. In addition, examining sputum and using auscultation and percussion, the results obtained are also extremely subtle. If tubercle bacilli are found in the sputum examination, and various rales are heard in auscultation, and dullness is present in percussion, then the patient is already in a serious state. It is not the early infiltration period, and the proper treatment period has been lost. Therefore, to discover early infiltration early, that is, early diagnosis of lung disease, it is necessary to use X-ray photography. At this time, shadows of unequal size can be revealed. Not only is it convenient for doctors to treat, but the patient can also be alerted to take preventive measures and seek medical attention early. In one fell swoop, several good things are achieved. Furthermore, if the X-ray does not show any signs of lung disease, it is even more gratifying. Not only is it unnecessary to seek medical attention, but there are also benefits in terms of economics and time, and the body and mind are also more pleasant.</p>
<p>In short, lung disease cannot detect the existence or absence of early infiltration by relying solely on percussion and auscultation. Before the development of science, most patients with lung disease lost the most suitable time for treatment, leading to rampant lung disease and becoming a great enemy of mankind. If ways can be found to diagnose early infiltration, then lung disease has a great tendency to be cured. Therefore, those who are at risk of contracting lung disease, or whose family and friends have lung disease, or those who are physically weak, if they often feel a slight fever, feverish palms, physical discomfort, coughing, etc., should immediately undergo an X-ray examination to clarify the cause of the disease. Then, there will be great progress in the prevention and treatment of lung disease, and with early treatment, lung disease can certainly be cured, so lung disease is truly not to be feared. What is to be feared is that patients lack the knowledge of the importance of early diagnosis, and generally delay and procrastinate until the disease progresses, and then throw medicine haphazardly, resulting in the loss of the proper treatment period, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Readers, please be aware that if you encounter someone suspected of having lung disease, you should advise them to seek diagnosis immediately. You must know that with early treatment, not only can physical health be restored early, but the economy of money and time is also a trivial matter. Since I have served in the hospital, I have seen that most of the patients' illnesses are due to the carelessness of early treatment. There are those who regret it for the rest of their lives, those who leave harm to their wives and children, and the losses to society and the country are even more obvious. The sights are shocking and heartbreaking, and nothing is worse than this. Therefore, I cannot help but speak earnestly. May those in the world who care do not disregard these words.</p>
<p>Lung Disease and Taking Medicine</p>
<p>Patients with tuberculosis who exclusively believe in medicine will never hope to be cured. Because there are two types of drugs, one is a drug with special effects, and the other is a drug that is generally symptomatic. At present, "there is no specific drug" for tuberculosis has been found. The drugs taken are mostly of a general nature, such as those that relieve coughs and dissolve phlegm, stimulate the appetite and nourish the blood, stop sweating, and strengthen the body. Therefore, in the early stages of the disease, if there is no guidance from a specialist doctor, but only seeking so-called sacred drugs and special drugs for tuberculosis and taking them, it is like heading south by driving the chariot north. I have not seen it work. Moreover, the so-called various sacred drugs and special drugs are not seen in countries with developed science, but in our country with backward science, they are dazzling and eye-catching. The number of colorful tuberculosis drugs is difficult to count. In reality, it only suffers the common people who have no medical knowledge. In the early stages of the disease, there is an opportunity to be cured, but because they do not know the importance of isolation and recuperation, they exclusively beg for medicine and repeatedly delay until the disease becomes serious before seeking medical attention, and it is too late. However, are drugs really ineffective for lung disease? This cannot be</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>generalized. In general, drugs formally prescribed by a doctor can indirectly increase resistance for the sick body, but they cannot directly eradicate tubercle bacilli.</p>
<p>In short, drugs for tuberculosis may be effective at the time, but they cannot eradicate the bacteria and fundamentally solve the problem, and recurrence is inevitable in the future. Dr. Miller, director of the Shanghai Sanitarium, said that tuberculosis patients who believe in medicine are better off being content with their fate and getting close to nature. But I believe that natural recuperation is a great help for treating the lungs, but it is limited to mild illnesses. Those with early cavities must first find ways to remove the lesions, and then supplement with long-term recuperation to achieve complete success. Therefore, patients should not quickly believe in medicine, nor should they exclusively rely on natural recuperation. They must have a deep determination, get rid of all worldly affairs, strictly rest, and receive specialized treatment, so that the root of the disease can be eradicated, recovery can be expected, and the gift of health can be restored.

<p>(4) Asafoetida</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>This product is the rootstock of HoruleAsafoetidaLinne and FerulafoetidaRegal or other Ferula plants of the Umbejjiferae family, which is cut and boiled to extract a resin containing gum.</p>
<p>Shape</p>
<p>This product has a few granular ones, called granular asafoetida (Asafoetidainganis), which is of good quality. The medicinal ones are harvested from this type. There are also giant block ones, called block asafoetida (Asafoetidainmassa), which is not a pure product and is not harvested for medicinal purposes. The fresh product has a white broken surface, gradually showing a red iridescence, and then turns yellowish or brownish. The dry quality is brittle, hard, and easily broken. It has a garlic-like odor, a harsh and bitter taste. When heated, it releases a good, fast aroma.</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>Granular asafoetida contains about 61% ferulic acid (Ferulasaure), other resins, gums, vanillin, volatile oils, etc. The reason why asafoetida has a foul odor is that its volatile oil contains sulfur.</p>
<p>Experimentation</p>
<p>One gram of this product, three milliliters of distilled water, grind it, and you should get a whitish emulsion. Add</p>
<p>a small amount of starch solution, which will turn yellow. Also, add one gram of this product to 10 ml of petroleum benzene, grind for 12 hours, filter, add 10 ml of freshly prepared copper acetate solution to the filtrate, shake and let stand. The petroleum benzene layer should not be dyed green. If it is green, it is proof that it is mixed with rosin.</p>
<p>Efficacy</p>
<p>This product is an antispasmodic, used for hysteria, pertussis, spasm, etc. Take 0.2 to 1.0 several times a day. It is also used as an enema material to expel pinworms.</p>

<p>(7) Accurate Diagnosis of Pregnancy</p>
<p>The diagnosis of whether or not one is pregnant is most difficult to determine in the first one or two months. Our famous traditional Chinese medicine practitioners can often determine whether or not one is pregnant based on the pulse record. Some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners say that a 50-day-old fetus can also be diagnosed on the pulse. This statement is a bit too ridiculous. Now I will write down the various diagnostic methods in detail, hoping that readers will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>(A) Accurate Diagnostic Method</p>
<p>To accurately diagnose pregnancy, a detailed examination of the uterus must be performed, or a chemical test, or palpation and listening to fetal heart sounds, etc.</p>
<p>(1) Uterine examination: If fertilization has occurred, the size of the uterus increases monthly, and the fundus of the uterus has a certain position, which is detailed in the previous article.</p>
<p>(2) Palpation: Divided into internal and external methods. External palpation method: Place your hand flat on the convex part of the abdomen and massage slowly to test for fetal movement. The larger the number of months, the easier it is to check. Internal palpation method: Make the pregnant woman lie on her back, insert one finger into the vagina, and place the other hand on the fundus of the uterus. Push one finger in the vagina upward to the cervix to feel the size of the uterus, and compare it with the number of months since menstruation stopped.</p>
<p>(3) Fetal heart sound: After 20 weeks of pregnancy, the fetal heart sound can be heard. Listening to fetal heart sounds in the second half of pregnancy is very obvious.</p>
<p>If any one of the above several methods can be determined, it can prove certainty.</p>
<p>(Note) Pregnancy is a physiological phenomenon in a woman, not a disease, but it can also be affected by it, so that it is easy to contract diseases. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(6) Salts</p>
<p>Most Foods and Drinks Contain Green Salts and Mineral Salts, etc.</p>
<p>(7) Water Content</p>
<p>All Fresh Foods and Drinks, as well as those Cooked, Contain a Large Amount of Water, Except for Dry or Dried Products, Which Contain Very Little.</p>
<p>2. Suitable Nutritional Methods</p>
<p>A. Complete Nutritional Foods: The three main elements in foods should be included in the daily nutrition, and various foods should be combined. If using foods that lean towards one element, then the other two are lacking, or if two are lacking, then one is lacking, which often leads to malnutrition.</p>
<p>B. Mainly Plant-Based Foods: Our daily foods are usually a mix of animal and plant-based foods. As seen above, vitamins are abundant in various plants. However, proteins and fats cannot be omitted either, but using a small amount is enough to supplement them. Therefore, using mainly plant-based foods for nutrition is still sound, as seen in Eastern nations. As for foods, fresh and living ones are the best.</p>
<p>C. Good Fats and Oils: Animal fats such as fresh cream, cod liver oil, and various extracted vegetable oils such as olive oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, tea oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., are good because they greatly increase the secretion of digestive juices, such as gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, etc., and indirectly stimulate intestinal peristalsis, which is beneficial for promoting nutrition. However, heated and processed fats are not easily digested, and using them may cause indigestion in the stomach and intestines. All animal and plant fats and oils should be freshly made. Moreover, long-stored ones are often spoiled or have various preservatives added, which is very bad.</p>
<p>D. Introduce Large Amounts of Vitamins into the Body: Fresh plant foods are very rich in vitamins. Refer to the various food items. If using many processed foods, the ingredients in them may be completely lost or only a small amount remains. Therefore, it is advisable to eat more fresh foods, such as vegetables and fruits. Vitamin B is the easiest to lose, so unrefined rice and wheat, as well as other foods rich in Vitamin B, should be consumed daily to avoid a deficiency of this vitamin, which can cause beriberi.</p>
<p>E. No Need to Drink Too Much Water Daily: The foods consumed daily already contain a large amount of water, which is enough for the body. Drinking too much water will dilute the digestive juices in the stomach and cause them to accumulate inside, also causing the stomach to swell, leading to indigestion and gastrectasia. Summer and after sweating are exceptions. As for drinking water, it is not easily absorbed; however, orange and lemon juice are more easily absorbed and provide a quick feeling of quenching thirst and coolness.</p>
<p>F. Daily Food Intake Should Not Be Excessive: When healthy, consuming only 90% of one's appetite is sufficient for the body's needs. Excessive consumption is also wasteful and overworks the stomach and intestines, causing them to be injured. The various functions of the entire body are also overworked, leading to premature aging.</p>
<p>G. Meal Times: In addition to following local customs and family habits, the following points should also be noted:</p>
<p>1. It is advisable to rest a little before eating in order to eat properly.</p>
<p>2. It is advisable to change the environment during meals and temporarily forget work.</p>
<p>3. Meal times should be ample in order to chew thoroughly; rapid swallowing is harmful to the stomach.</p>
<p>4. Rest for one hour after eating before engaging in mental or physical labor; otherwise, blood flow to the internal organs will be reduced, which will also harm digestion.</p>
<p>8. Nutritional Foods and Addictions to Avoid: A. Tobacco and Alcohol, Because addiction harms the body.</p>
<p>B. Coffee, Tea, and Leaf Tea, These types of tea also contain stimulating substances, and addiction harms the body.</p>
<p>C. Salt: We use it to season food, but it is often used to stimulate the kidneys, which may harm the kidneys and easily lead to gallstones and kidney stones. It is advisable to reduce or avoid it, but the body will not be deficient because most foods contain green salt, and input is already rich, so there is no harm.</p>
<p>D. Spices and Other Stimulating Substances in Soups: Soups, braised meats, and crispy foods contain spices and stimulating substances, which make them very delicious and can stimulate the appetite, but prolonged use can harm the stomach, leading to poor appetite and indigestion.</p>

<h3 id="e223">How to Commemorate January 28th <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>January 28th. With a heart full of fervent grief, I "calmly" walked onto the streets amidst the cheerful clamor of "Happy New Year," because I also "loved my country and did not lag behind," and had already "prepared for long-term resistance." So, besides "saving the country with my conscience" and not buying inferior goods, I also wanted to see if our "patriotic heroes" were as enthusiastic as I was. Perhaps I would be lucky enough to witness some earth-shattering events, but I was very disappointed. It was no different than usual. Many shops were only displaying Spring Festival couplets to mark the "market strike" in mourning.</p>
<p>Helpless, I bought a special edition of the newspaper on that day.</p>
<p>In this half sheet of newspaper, I gained many satisfying lessons. I carefully copied the newspaper as follows:</p>
<p>⊙ Yokosuka: On the 28th, to commemorate the first anniversary of the Shanghai Incident, the Yokosuka Gunnery School, under the command of former Major General Sha, held a simulated street battle to recall the incident. (Report from the 27th, Dentsu Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Various circles in the capital decided to hold a commemorative meeting for the first anniversary of the January 28th Anti-Japanese War at the National Grand Theater at 9:00 AM on the 28th, with Zhang Yuanliang (note, not Zhang Xueliang) as the chairman. All citizens observed one minute of silence (of course, not three minutes) at 11:00 AM to express their condolences, and drafted commemorative slogans and many major proposals. (Report from the 27th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>After reading these two messages in comparison, alas, I want to remain silent. Fortunately, the same newspaper also has an article that is exciting enough, and of course, there is a need to spread it. I hope you will not regard it lightly.</p>
<p>"…Therefore, we can only recognize the reasons for the outbreak of the January 28th disaster if we clearly recognize the increasingly profound and expanded active aggression of Japanese imperialism. At the same time, we can only recognize the current way out for our nation if we grasp the theory of answering the war of aggression by Japanese imperialism with a national revolutionary war.</p>
<p>····································</p>
<p>The January 28th bloody battle is glorious. In the history of national revolution, it will always be one of the most valuable contributions. However, in terms of the current situation of our nation, this glorious war should not stop with January 28th.</p>
<p>…We can commemorate January 28th, not with tears, not with sighs, not with sorrow, but with blood. We should strengthen our own bulwarks, should recognize the current great enemy, and should firmly grasp the weapon of national revolutionary war. Only in this way can we maintain the glory of the January 28th Anti-Japanese bloody battle, and only in this way can we promote our nation towards a world of bright future."</p>

<p>— Qi Yu</p>
<p>Riding the Cang Dragon north, I gaze at the imperial capital in Liaodong, soaring majestically to the ninth heaven, embracing the peaks of Hebei, like fierce beasts crouching on all sides, and like playful divine dragons. Hundreds of streams vie to wash its feet, and the hills and mounds come to offer homage. Towering and not vulgar, it is indeed the hero of the universe. The vast Bohai Sea embraces it in front, and the winding Great Wall seals it to the west. Looking east at the boundless plains, the land is rich and its bounty abundant. For a long time, strong neighbors have stealthily watched it, and the majestic pass angrily glares and deters the wicked. Suddenly, chaos erupts overnight, instantly darkening the majestic countenance of the famous fortress. The heavens, the earth, the grass, and the trees all change color, why do these living creatures not beat their chests? I grieve for the soldiers who give their lives while the main generals are cowardly and timid, the epitome of eternal foolishness. People also whisper their words, but they turn a deaf ear to them. Righteous armies suddenly rise beyond the border, and the masses proclaim, "We vow to provide support!" But why are there so many mouths and so few hands in this world, only hearing empty words of saving the country? I lament the righteous army's bloody battles, while you are embracing prostitutes and drunkenly sleeping. They use guns and cannons, we use blood and flesh, the horizontal division is everywhere, but who pities them?</p>
<p>Ammunition is exhausted, and support is cut off, the sound shakes the sky, and close combat ensues. Cannons are like thunder, and machine guns are like bees, heads are suddenly severed, and limbs are quickly broken. The wind howls, piercingly cold, the sky is bleak, and snow falls again. The desert is vast, and the air is gloomy, and rivers freeze for thousands of miles. Horses neigh, and apes howl, facing the daylight, they suspect ghosts. The country mourns its dead, and freeloaders surrender, the mountains rage, and the seas sob. The famous pass grieves, feeling dizzy, the ancient jade tablet is now a broken stone tablet.</p>
<p>In chaos, it is said, "Being brave in private fights but timid in public is why ancient countries lose their soldiers." Those dignitaries steal joy and are slow and lazy, so the famous pass is abandoned to the east. Gazing at the disordered border clouds from afar, I feel a sense of desolation, and tears fall. My hatred is boundless, how can I bear to end my life like this!</p>

<h3 id="e225">Urban Air Defense <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Fu</p>
<p>The slogan "No air defense, no national defense" has been clearly verified since the January 28th Shanghai Incident last year. Try to imagine with your eyes closed the bomber soaring five thousand meters above the ground, carrying large bombs weighing up to a ton or thousands of fierce incendiary bombs, and attacking like a violent storm. The bustling market instantly turns into scorched earth. It's enough to make one shudder. Now, enemy planes are rampant in the Rehe-Shanhaiguan area, and the air defense problem is really pressing.</p>
<p>The so-called "air defense" can also be said to be urban air defense, because the target that the enemy wants to destroy is the political and economic center of the opposing country, which is the large city. Now, let's briefly describe the urban air defense methods as follows...</p>
<p>(A) Directly Implemented Air Defense Methods</p>
<p>(1) Air Defense Aviation Corps: This organization is the main body of air defense, composed of fighter planes. When enemy planes attack, it is difficult to achieve full effectiveness by only relying on ground-based anti-aircraft guns. The so-called "fighting poison with poison" means that fighter planes must be used to intercept the enemy planes, so that the enemy planes cannot pass through and reach the city at all. Even if they have invaded, they can be annihilated by the fastest means, so that they can suffer less damage. Our country has suffered a lot because it does not have this kind of organization and preparation at all.</p>
<p>(2) Anti-Aircraft Gun Teams and Anti-Aircraft Machine Gun Teams: These two organizations are also the main components of air defense. New-style anti-aircraft guns are effective at six thousand meters above and below, no matter what. Although they cannot completely shoot down enemy planes, they at least give the enemy a kind of intimidation, so that their aerial movements cannot be carried out as they wish. It is best to set up gun positions on dangerous terrain eight thousand meters away from the city, which is tantamount to building an invisible aerial fence for this city. The main purpose of anti-aircraft machine guns is to directly protect buildings or other objects outside the anti-aircraft gun positions, and low-altitude shooting below two thousand meters cannot be done without them.</p>
<p>(3) Barrage Balloon Teams: This method was first used by Germany in the European War, and then Britain and France also followed suit, and the results were very good. Its purpose is to make the balloon collide with the plane, so that all the ropes on the balloon are wrapped around various parts of the fuselage, causing the plane to lose its lift and fall. Although it directly causes very few planes to fall, it at least prevents planes from flying at low altitudes of three thousand meters above and below at night, so the indirect effectiveness is very great.</p>
<p>(B) Indirectly Aiding Air Defense</p>
<p>(1) Lighting Control System: Its task is to extinguish the lights in the whole city so that the enemy loses the target for bombing. All the lights in the inner rooms must be strictly guarded to prevent them from leaking outside. Necessary lights, such as the red and green lights at the train station and the street lights on important traffic roads, must also be covered so that the light does not leak upwards. However, the extinction of lights must be implemented in the villages and towns around the city; otherwise, it will clearly tell the enemy that the dark place is the target. Therefore, although this system has a significant effect, it cannot be achieved without careful preparation and consideration.</p>
<p>(2) Searchlights and Listening Devices: If air defense aviation teams or anti-aircraft gun teams are fighting at night, then searchlights and listening devices are absolutely necessary. The candlelight of searchlights is usually between 200,000,000 and 300,000,000, and the range is about ten kilometers. Listening devices can determine the direction from which enemy planes are coming, and then use searchlights to illuminate them, which is effective. In short, the two must be used in conjunction with each other, which is very effective for night combat, especially for anti-aircraft gun teams.</p>
<p>(3) Air Defense Watchtowers: That is, a balloon is floated to about 50 to 200 kilometers above the ground, and people are sent up to monitor closely with telescopes. If they find enemy planes coming from afar, they will immediately report to the air defense headquarters on the ground.</p>
<p>Most of the air defense methods mentioned above are the responsibility of the government's military department. As for the citizens, they should also have some common sense of air defense. A little bit is briefly described below...</p>
<p>(1) Firefighting: It goes without saying that houses in cities are densely packed, and fires will start due to incendiary bombs. The importance of firefighting can also be imagined. Therefore, in addition to quickly organizing more fire brigades, citizens should usually prepare a supply of water, rubber hoses, sand, ash, and various fire extinguishers. No matter how small a fire is, it must be completely extinguished, otherwise it will become a prairie fire.</p>
<p>(2) Poison Prevention and Poison Gas Removal: When those cruel poison gas bombs are dropped, it is necessary to have sufficient preparation in advance. It is best for citizens to have their own absorption canisters. After the poison gas passes through this canister, it is either absorbed or neutralized to become a non-toxic gas. Usually, activated carbon and soda lime are used for this. The residual poison gas on the ground should be treated with neutralizers or removed by ventilation. There are two types of poison prevention devices for indoor and underground structures: the first method is to completely isolate it from the outside world, but it is necessary to prepare a supply of oxygen; the second method is to install poison gas filtration devices at windows and entrances. In short, poison prevention is a very</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>urgent matter; otherwise, death is very likely.</p>
<p>(3) Shelters: Shelters can be built in houses, but they must be extremely strong, because when an armor-piercing bomb is dropped, even the strength of cement can be broken, but piling up thick soil can prevent it in case of emergency. The most important point is that when enemy planes attack, there is no need to panic excessively. Panic makes it easy to mess things up. It is best to hide in the pre-built shelter at home, and if you are outside, find a depression to hide in. This can at least avoid the fragments of bombs flying out. In short, keep your mind calm, and you may be able to escape from death; otherwise, you will only lose your life.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Impressions of New Year's Day <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Cen</p>
<p>The New Year's Day here is the just-passed lively Lunar New Year's Day. Although the lunar calendar has become obsolete, the Lunar New Year festival is already a "discarded year." However, because of the deep-rooted customs and concepts that people have had for thousands of years regarding the lunar calendar, most people still use the lunar calendar, so the Lunar New Year festival is still particularly grand. There are still many people who celebrate the Gregorian New Year and then celebrate the Lunar New Year again, and they are very indifferent to the Gregorian New Year, but very enthusiastic about the Lunar New Year. This is a custom and habit of thousands of years, and it is really not easy to transfer it in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Because I wrote a manuscript on New Year's Eve, I didn't go to sleep until three o'clock in the morning, so when I woke up, it was already eleven o'clock. After washing up, I adjusted the room a little, sorted out another manuscript, and hurriedly went out. I looked at the clock on the street and it was already past one o'clock. The shops were all closed. My stomach was very hungry, but where could I buy something to eat? I remembered that Jie Zi had invited me to spend the New Year. Let's go there. I'll find a food shop on the way. I walked north along Rue Luber. Braving the sharp north wind. The weather was gloomy and cold. When I woke up, I saw a very good sun, but it quickly turned into such gloomy and severe weather. I bravely moved forward in the fierce and roaring cold wind, from Rue Luber to Gordon Road.</p>
<p>The streets on New Year's Day were unusually deserted and desolate. Probably because the weather was too gloomy and cold, people were hiding at home to have fun, or sneaking into theaters and amusement parks. Who would be playing wildly on the streets? The shops were all closed, but from the walls and plank walls, I could hear the sounds of sparrows, mahjong, or the shouting and yelling of gambling inside. On the streets I walked, there was almost no shop or house without the sound of gambling. I thought that in this place, the practical function of gambling has mostly become entertainment. Who doesn't want games? Who doesn't want recreation? And in general Chinese society, the only and most convenient thing that can provide games and recreation is gambling. There are all kinds and varieties of gambling tools everywhere, and gambling is also an interesting game with a competitive nature. So, in the New Year, gambling is generally the most interesting game and pastime.</p>
<p>Children were all wearing new clothes of various colors, surrounded by food stalls and toy stalls by the side of the road. Many children were setting off firecrackers. The small firecrackers would "bang" when they were thrown hard on the ground. The children were the happiest, especially in such a grand, lively, and enjoyable New Year.</p>
<p>At street corners and alleys, there seemed to be many more disabled, old, and weak beggars than usual, each with bodily forms that were pitiful, waiting for the people enjoying the New Year to beg from.</p>
<p>I passed Avenue Foch and Chengdu Road and walked to Carter Road. I still hadn't found a place to eat. My stomach was yelling with hunger. Finally, I found a Tangyuan shop on Carter Road and ate four hot Tangyuan to barely satisfy my hunger. After eating the Tangyuan, I felt a lot of heat added to my body and continued to rush into the cold wind.</p>
<p>I moved forward in the flying snowflakes of Gordon Road. From afar, I heard bursts of violent sounds of "Kill, kill..." Because of my experience as a "Qiu Ba student," I knew that it was probably the army practicing bayonet drills. When I got closer, I went to the gate of the "Joint-Stock Company" of the inner and outer yarn factory and saw a team of Japanese soldiers, Japanese marines, wearing body armor and holding guns with bayonets, practicing bayonet drills in the courtyard inside, practicing the white-blade battle of charging and killing. When Chinese people see this scene, their hearts cannot bear it, let alone me, a young man! I was thinking that today is New Year's Day, and Chinese people are busy celebrating the New Year, busy enjoying themselves, and living a drunken and dreamlike life, while the Japanese army is practicing bayonet drills in the cold snow, practicing killing, preparing to kill Chinese people! Ah, ah, drunken and dreamlike Chinese people! Still not waking up? The enemy is practicing killing us right in front of us!</p>
<p>My heart was beating, my blood was rushing, I clenched my fists, and I continued to move forward with all my might, walking my path...</p>

<p>"She is much more capable than me!" Zhongnan lit a small cigar with one hand, squinting at Ruohua. "The Great Learning says that those who wish to govern their country must first regulate their family. I am ashamed to say that although I manage the finances of a province, I have no way to manage my own family affairs. You see, since she came to take care of my family, expenses have been saved, and I often have the opportunity to eat local flavors. The upper rooms are also organized, and the people below are also doing things in order. When I spend half a day at home, I don't feel stuffy anymore. Unlike before, when I returned to the mansion, it was like walking into a city of sorrow. If she uses her family management skills to govern the region, I think there will be excellent results!"</p>
<p>"You're making fun of me!" Ruohua glared at Zhongnan with her pretty eyes. The lightning-like gaze instantly shifted from Zhongnan's face to Youzhong's eyes.娇嗔 transformed into娇羞, she smiled charmingly and quickly lowered her head.</p>
<p>"Daddy!" Daiqiu handed a cigar to Zhongnan's mouth with one hand and held a box of洋火 in the other, striking a light for him.</p>
<p>"Good son!" Zhongnan took a puff of smoke and then hugged her in his arms, kissing her apple-like cheeks.</p>
<p>"Fifth Uncle is here. Aren't you going to pay your respects?" Ruohua ordered Daiqiu.</p>
<p>"Fifth Uncle!" Daiqiu bowed respectfully to Youzhong and automatically offered him a cigarette, lighting the洋火 for him in the same way. Youzhong originally smoked, but because it was inconvenient to refuse this young lady's enthusiasm, he had to reluctantly learn to smoke. His smoking posture was not very elegant. Ruohua laughed when she saw it.</p>
<p>"How old are you?" Youzhong also hugged her in his arms, kissing her face.</p>
<p>"Twelve years old," Daiqiu twisted her neck and leaned into Youzhong's arms.</p>
<p>"Fifth Uncle, she can sing! Daiqiu, sing a little lover song for Fifth Uncle. Fifth Uncle will take you to see a movie tomorrow."</p>
<p>Urged by her mother, Daiqiu left Youzhong's arms, singing and making expressions at the same time. She sang very harmoniously and rhythmically. Youzhong clapped his hands and praised her repeatedly. Zhongnan listened with great satisfaction. After watching her finish twisting and turning, he smiled and scolded her, "Little monster!"</p>
<p>While they were laughing happily, a small child with yellow nasal mucus walked in from outside, dragging his feet as he walked up to Zhongnan...</p>
<p>"Daddy! Mom wants you to go."</p>
<p>"What's the matter again?" Zhongnan lowered his face and asked fiercely.</p>
<p>"Mom has a stomachache and wants you to rub her belly."</p>
<p>"Bullshit!" Zhongnan's "shit" word was uttered with twelve points of strength,彈茂生 out of the room. Ruohua looked at Youzhong and laughed. Youzhong burst open his lips, afraid to laugh out loud. Daiqiu hid behind Zhongnan, secretly scraping her grandpa's face.</p>
<p>Zhongnan stood up and apologized, "One child is so cute, and another is so annoying! It shows that a mother's education for children is the most important."</p>
