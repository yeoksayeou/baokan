<p>蘇僞（其實是蘇日）談判讓渡中東路會議自本年六月二十六日在日本東京開會以來迄今已一月有半當會議開始之際雙方爲東鐵所有權問題及估價問題即開始激烈之衝突蘇聯堅主對東鐵有所有權僞方則絕對否認之僅承認蘇聯對東鐵有抽象的共同經營權益關於估價問題蘇聯討價爲二億五千萬金盧布僞方則僅允五千萬日金雙方主張大相懸殊自是以後雖屢次開會前後共有六次之多蘇僅允減價五千萬最近據電訊所傳蘇僞爲金盧布與日金換算率相持不下雙方仍無接近可能而同時日本則積極在北滿作軍事準備宣稱如談判决裂即由僞國以强力奪取東鐵蘇聯在遠東邊境亦復嚴陣以待劍拔弩張聲勢洶洶蘇僞談判售路會議至是蓋已顯然陷於不可挽救之僵局此後如非蘇聯願作絕大之讓步糾紛恐不易了也</p>
<p>日本之所以必欲攫取東鐵無疑的爲日本帝國主義尋求出路更進一步之表現目下全世界資本主義國家方深苦於經濟恐慌之兇險的襲擊各個資本主義國家雖竭盡方法力圖遏止此種狂潮之邁進但其結果非特無效反愈陷愈深在此情况之下資本主義唯一之出路舍爭奪市塲再分割殖民地與夫準備戰爭以外更無他途而日本則爲此種主義之先驅故在世界經濟極度恐慌之下即以迅雷不及掩耳之手段佔我東北日本固深知此種獨占行動必爲歐美其他各國所不容但亦深知目前世界資本主義國家間之錯綜複雜的矛盾尙未解除决不至對日即有干涉之舉故敢毅然行之而不疑結果英法對日旣默無表示美國則除［講台外交］外亦未有積極之行動凡世界各個資本主義國家之所以對日本者一一盡如日本之所預期惟蘇聯在東省最後根據地之東鐵仍横梗其間未能攫取到手此於日本在我東北整個侵略政策上自屬絕大妨碍而現在世界經濟會議已告結果各個資本主義國家間之經濟鬥爭與軍備競爭已隨世界經濟會議之消逝而加緊展開國際資本主義顯然已走向另一新的鬥爭途程此一新的鬥爭途程即爲加緊凖備第二次世界大戰日本認淸此種形勢必須加緊將勢力伸入北滿一以完成其在東北之根據地一借反蘇旗幟博取其他資本主義國家之好感以支持其最後之命運故遂有攫取東鐵之舉</p>
<p>日本所以必欲攫取東鐵之意義旣如上述則蘇聯又何爲决定將東鐵出售於日本旣已决定出售於日又何爲對於各種問題絕不讓步致陷談判於不可挽救之局面乎此實不煩言而可解蘇聯之所以决定將東鐵出售於日無他鑒於世界各個資本主義國家之環攻形勢深知在此兩個明顯的對立之下就蘇聯目前本身之能力言萬不容冒險與各個資本主義國家輕啓戰端而其所以在售路談判中不肯盡量讓步者則又以今日世界各個資本主義國家間之矛盾急切間尙無調和一致之可能而蘇聯現在之外交旣甚有利又足以自增其力量故如可以不讓步者蘇聯自不肯貿然讓步此蘇聯所以在會議中一再堅持其主張也</p>
<p>由是言之蘇僞談判售路會議今後進展之趨勢可以知矣就整個世界情勢言之倘因東鐵問題將引起蘇聯地位之不利則蘇聯仍祗有讓步反之國際情勢尙不致因東鐵問題引起對蘇之不利則讓渡之談判恐非一時所能解决或謂日本至此將起而取直接行動以武力强奪東鐵彼時蘇聯又將奈何椎以吾人觀察恐蘇聯亦仍祇有退讓之一法欲對日作戰吾人殊未見其可能雖然世界第二次大戰在最近之將來固無論如何必不能免無論其爲資本主義集圑間之戰爭抑爲資本主義與社會主義間之戰爭爾時蘇聯必爲大戰中一最要之角色此則可以斷言者</p>

<p>彭夫中國代表胡適在太平洋學會大會開幕日演說、痛斥各國競爭海軍之非、謂美國業經實行與各國正在計議中之造艦計劃、其勢將隳毁數十年來艱苦締造之和平機械、數年前各國力勸拆毁作戰工具、今乃轉而拆毁和平工具、良可腕歎云云、日代表新渡户演說、則力言經濟戰爭愈演愈烈、危險可虞、各國間亟有合理的調整之必要、蓋隱指英國殖民地對於非英貨增稅及美國經濟計劃而言、英代表前巴力斯坦高等委員蕯繆爾聲稱、英國在遠東除維持原來貿易外、僅欲增進其地方之安寗而已、英國不願得特殊利益、尤不事干涉云云、（十五日國民電）</p>

<p>京滬路先付二十七萬元</p>
<p>滬杭路折付二萬五千鎊</p>
<p>邇來西文報紙、屢有議論京滬滬杭甬兩路債欵本息欠付情事、涉及京滬路者尤多、而路局方面、未嘗有所表示、惟據昨日所聞、該局已經籌付本金餘利兩批、足見該局着實致力於减輕債務、不事空言塞責、茲將其償付情形、誌之於左、</p>
<p>京滬路積欠債欵、爲數甚巨、如十八年份至二十年份之餘利、中英公司代墊購車欵、十九年份至二十二年份之到期借欵本金、以及最近三期借欵利息等、均待淸償、留意該路事務者、諒已知之、是項欠欵之中、最近曾於本年三月内、償還購車墊欵一期、計英金九千鎊、其餘各項、均因欵絀未付、茲因積極整理之下、積有欵項二十七萬元、决先儘數撥付積欠最久之十八年份餘利、該項餘利、共欠三九八·八三九·二○元、此次撥付二十七萬元之後、尙欠一六·八三九·二○元、聞二個月後、亦即可如數淸償云、</p>
<p>滬杭甬路之經濟情形、較京滬路稍優、但自上年滬戰以後、上年五月份内到期之借欵本金、即未能照付、迄今已逾數期、每期各爲三萬七千五百鎊、路局業已將該路特别準備金項下、積存之數、約二十萬元提出、復在營業現欵項下、籌得同樣欵數、共凑成四十萬元、折合英金二萬五千鎊、交與匯豐銀行、俾作償付上年五月到期借欵本金一部份之用、其餘聞將俟積有成數時、陸續淸償云</p>

<p>昨日預審之後、兩被告之辯護律師谷倫聞曾提出請求被告暫行交保、隨傳隨到、惟捕房與葡領事均以兩人之犯案情節重大、未可與普通事件視之、故不准交保、訊畢、仍交西捕頭威廉斯帶兩被告押至厦門路西牢、候正式定期開審時、再提到領署、仍送汽車押送至牢、</p>

<p>癮君子亦步亦趨盜匪以爲有意追蹤</p>
<p>警士聞槍聲四面探查盜竟走頭無路</p>
<p>先後開槍二人慘死非命</p>
<p>昨晨三時四十五分、閘北五區三分所轄境内香烟橋附近、發生盜匪情虚、槍殺行人及崗警一名案、茲將調查所得、紀述於下、</p>

<p>許金龍、年四十歲、掦州人、在十年前、與其母許陳氏卜居於閘北天同路第一百四十七弄第四號門牌、當時許尙業成衣、故生活頗堪自給、詎未幾以交游不愼、日習下流、終日與無賴爲伍、並染吸鴉片、其母屢戒不改、因此恨之入骨、乃即於當時下令逐出、並永遠不准歸宗、但金龍此後非但不改、竟更變本加厲、實行過其流氓生活、惟收入無從、故不久又自流氓而流爲乞丐、日間蹀躍街頭、晚則露宿於閘北嘉興路沈家灣一帶、偶得微資、即往虹口通州路等處燕子窼内尋其烟霞之樂、</p>
<h3 id="c156">亦步亦趨 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>昨晨三時左右、金龍方集得小洋數角、而烟癮突來、乃由沈家灣步行至通州路、擬赴燕子窼過癮、當行經交通路時、見前面有一身穿短衫褲者倉惶奔走、當意爲趕路者、故不爲意、惟斯時金龍以烟癮大發、不克久持、故步履間亦無形加緊、但後者無意、前者有心、將近宋家弄時、該穿短衫褲者竟係一匪徒、回首見金龍在後亦步亦趨、同時又在黑暗中難以辨認、一時情虚、意爲探員在後追趕、竟圖先發制人之計、即從身畔摸出手槍、回身向金龍開放一槍、</p>

<h3 id="c253">没有希望所以舞弊 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦鷗</p>
<p>在這個年頭，物質的引诱是一天比一天厲害了。人類對於一切享樂的追求慾，也跟着一天一天的濃厚起來，普遍起來。以致於在每一個未到衰老時期的人的面前，都堆起了一重美麗的憧憬，使他們時刻不忘地祈禱着，希望着。偏是現在這個社會，滿充着種種畸形的發展和醜惡的黑暗，它們會使你的很正當的希望歸於泡影，會使你的奮門的毅力完全消滅。結果：一半人是鬰鬱無聊地奄化了，還有一半，便極不費事地流爲法律上的罪人。這種現象，在各報的本埠新聞欄裡，每天終可以表現出若干來。</p>
<p>昨天，我的身子坐在某法院的刑庭理，無意中，聴到了下面這一段値得注意的問答。</p>
<p>法官：你好好地××局辦事，爲什麽要盜用公欵呢？</p>
<p>犯人：（態度很悲痛激昂）因爲我知道我的前途是没有希望了，所以我不得不用舞弊的方法，來滿足我的需要。</p>
<p>法官：這是什麽話？你如果能刻苦工作，努力辦事，怎會没有希望呢？</p>
<p>犯人：［刻苦工作］，［努力辦事］，過去的十四年裡，我何嘗不如此啊！眼見許多賣緣而進的新脚色，來一個二百元，調一個三百元，至於我呢，兀是不滿一百！寳貴的靑春，已在這整天受氣挨駡的光陰裏消磨盡了。不舞弊還有什麽希望！（說話的聲音愈後愈高，涙水跟汗黏成了一片。）</p>
<p>法官：唔········（躊踷了半嚮）好！侵呑公欵總是有罪的，聴候宣判吧！·········</p>
<p>底下，當然是幾年幾個月了，可是我已經没有勇氣再聽下去了。對於這件事情，我根本不願作什么評議。其實也了敢！但是，我記得小時候看濟公傳，碰到有什麽不平的事情發生　，他老人家總會翩然而至　。而且他往往還用手指着空中說道：［那旁有黑氣一道，直衝霄漢，定有不平之事　，我不管還有誰管！］接首，他就眞的趕將過去　，巧使神通，把那不平的事情　，處理得又公又平，大快人心　，如果濟公眞有這樣一個人，眞有這麽一種神通的話，我想活到現在，也要不行了。第一天空中黑氣太多，到處盡是些不平之事，教他從那一件管起呢？也許他老人家未卜先知，早知道有這種日子，所以便先自脫身了。</p>

<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>太陽剛下地平線，電燈尙未至需要的時候，在八仙橋靑年會的電梯裏，充滿了佩帶徽章的人一直送上九樓。這便是申報業餘補習學校五個學校中來參與大會的人。</p>
<p>大會未開之前，先舉行聚餐，靑年會的九樓東廳食堂裏，周圍排列着二十四個桌子，四面的窗打開着，習習的微風掠過了桌上所列的杯盤碗筷，仍舊投到那一面的窗外去：顯得十分淸爽。穿白衣服的侍者，往來蹀　着，似乎有多一會兒，簽名處擁擠起來了，於是一個個的人頭，都向每個席面移動：幾個站在門口的人，口中不停地吐出招待的話語，同時每一隻眼光却射到進來的人的徽章上。第二校的同學，把他們的校刋│黃昏的鐘│塞到每一個同學的手内。</p>
<p>大家坐定了，校長史量才先生坐在居中的一桌上在看着這許多門生笑，白衣侍者開始忙碌着，將一道一道菜向每一個桌上送，但是很慢，於是主席李公樸副校長站起來，用滑稽的語調向許多同學說：『菜來得太慢了，諸位同學可以吃得慢一點，不要吃得太飽了吃不下以後的菜。』同學都笑了。食堂内充滿的就是史校長說的［香甜的空氣］。</p>
<p>大會開幕了，</p>
<p>主席，校長，教務長，學員代表，相繼發表了不少的妙論，誠懇，眞摰，親愛，擊進了每一個同學的心靈，如雷的掌聲，充滿了會塲的空間。顯得這得個大會的意義，非常之偉大。</p>
<p>主席宣布了餘興開始，愉快便又跑上了各個同學的面容而代替了莊嚴，於是莽大令先生之故事笑話，，李副校長之夏威夷格太獨奏，申報館同人的國術表演，明星公司送映之影片狂流，一項一項，一幕一幕，音樂激盪着耳鼓，表演演麻醉了心靈，直至歸去的路上，滿載着的全是：歡欣，鼓舞，感激，了解。</p>

<p>在帝政專制時代，做小民的在［皇恩浩蕩］之下，謹謹愼愼的做個順民、安居樂業，循規蹈矩。不該異想天開，去做古人不曾做過的事；更不容許標新立異，别樹一幟。否則，就太不安分守己，且要目爲［反動分子］。</p>
<p>所以在這樣壓力之下，做小民的祇有守前人已成的事業，做别人做過的事。</p>
<p>現在，且舉一個例，就以商店的招牌來說明：</p>
<p>到過杭州的人想都知道，張小湶的剪刀是中外馳名的。假若我們預備買幾把剪刀回去贈送朋友，困難就來了；幾乎每條街上都有一二家張小湶剪刀店。特别註明［祖傳二百餘年］，［只此一家並無分出］，這才呌我們莫名其妙。聽說有什麽［記］的是眞的，仔細觀看，［近記］，［遠記］，［逹記］，［述記］，又是些烟幕彈，那全是些形象相仿的字眼。</p>
<p>在上海也有這樣的事，熟肉店，總歸是陸稿薦，而且都各日標明［眞］而［老］</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>别人辛苦經營，好容易才有一個［令譽］的店家招牌，毫不費力的偷竊來，據爲己有，我想這是在帝政專制時代政府所默許的。</p>
<p>假使帝政繼續下去，賣什麽的店，有什麽一律的招牌，那倒是［統一］而［别緻］的事。</p>

<p>我聽了這話不禁稱奇［如此看來·我們窮人没有到廬山，莫干山的資格，還不如鑽進鐵窗去避暑一番，倒也很經濟，連房飯賬都不用付，豈不便宜之至麽？］我這樣說着，李君笑了。</p>

<h3 id="c258">袁寒雲到平湖的一瞥 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>洹上袁寒雲，在近代文學史上，頗佔有數行地位。就他的家世而論，大類陳思王植，可是他的長兄克定，却比不上文帝丕了。這不過是我隨意的譬比，因爲談到袁寒雲，自然都不免聯憶到袁項城及其洪憲一幕，恰好魏武有那麽一個獨佔八斗才的兒子·寒雲正有點像，便寫了這個譬比。其實我們對於洪憲的舊賬，是不欲多翻的；我們只覺得寒雲之逝，是中國文壇上很可惋惜的事，教人懷想不已！因而對於他生前的軼事，也就彌覺可珍，下面，就是他到平湖的一瞥。</p>
<p>他到平湖去，不知是爲了什麽事，其時正當項城稱帝不成，還爲大總統，全國人民對項城的感情不佳之際。他是坐了一條普通的船去的。其實寒雲的爲人，和克定完全兩樣，項城稱帝，寒雲根本反對，並曾當面苦苦地諍諫過；項城倒没什麽，反是克定想做儲君之熱烈，倍甚於項城，致有後來的結果。卽使寒雲在元二年全國崇敬項城時，甚或帝制居然成功之後，他到平湖去，也必不肯張揚，乘坐普通的船。所以那時候，他倒未必因了人民反對項城，纔那樣地悄然而往，不使人知，這是他的胸襟如此。</p>
<p>然而當地的平湖日報，竟知道了，特地出了一份號外，專爲報告［袁大總統公子克文抵邑］的消息，衝動了全城的人心，大家都奔到東湖去，探看寒雲所乘坐的船一覘大總統公子的顔色。豈知没見着公子却看到他那妾舅的戇態，引得人人注目，人人忍俊。</p>
<p>這個所謂妾舅，就是唐志君的阿弟。志君是平湖人，伊的父親是個業水菓攤的。阿弟年齡尙小，平日不穿長衣，聽說寒雲到了，幼稚的意識裏也知道須往迎接，並不能不穿長衣去，便向人借了一套袍褂，也趕到東湖。他旣没有穿得慣長衣，那一套袍褂又是借來的，不大合身，自然不免於引人發笑了。</p>
<p>大槪凡是婦女，總具有虚榮心！依寒雲的意思，就在船上過一夜，免得有多少麻煩；唐志君却定要寒雲上岸，到伊家裏去一趟，以爲榮寵。寒雲正愛志君，不忍拂其意，只得上岸。可是伊家裏又不能住，臨時租賃某姓屋。剛剛坐定，門外便又圍了一大羣的人。還有許多販古董的商人，知道寒雲的癖嗜，紛紛挾了古董來，視爲發財的機會。更有售賣烟土的，也登門求售，來來往往，絡繹不絕。屋主人知道寒雲是不久留的，以爲日子一長，那還了得，門限也要給擠穿了；又不便當面對寒雲說，却請過寒雲的僕人，表示限日他遷。僕人轉告寒雲。寒雲大不樂，立卽將全眷仍遷回船上。但對屋主人，却始終没說一名話。</p>
<p>旣遷回船上，志君又慫恿放東洋熖火，伊的意思，無非藉此以表豪闊。寒雲正在愛伊，無可無不可，伊便準備起來。消息一傳，看的人又是不少。其時適値戒嚴，縣知事朱孚保，遣人婉止，寒雲卽允。志君和伊的母親，定不肯罷休，仍自促役搭臺。朱孚保倒也是個强項令，又誤會是寒雲不肯中止，立飭警士二十四名，逕往拆臺；並手諭：如有阻撓，不問何人，拘案覆命。志君與母只好中止，泣告寒雲。寒雲亦怒，致電浙督盧永祥。電旣發，寒雲便好像忘懷了似的，也不等盧永祥覆電，就此開船離去平湖了。</p>

<h3 id="c259">從武俠小說到幽默雜文 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>早幾時武俠小說曾大流行過，牠的力量很大，竟有商店小徒因此着了迷而結伴到峩嵋山去修道的，武俠小說中所帶的神怪分子，是武術的峯巓，所以企圖獲得最高武術的，總想去找仙人。武俠小說的失敗，也就在這裏，因爲世上仙人不容易有，他們的架空便時時刻刻顯出破綻，一與現實社會接觸，便不能存立了。</p>
<p>但武俠作品的確曾有一時抓住大衆的心神，只看其出書種類之多與銷路之暢，便可知道。而且善於投機的電影業，也因此攝製了不少的武俠神怪影片，可爲明證。并且武俠小說的流行，也是有其必然的理由，就是大衆渴想此種武士俠客的出現，卽使只在書本上看看，也覺得心中痛快的。</p>
<p>當社會上大多數人都覺得苦悶，都想要申訴，都希望有人來代抱不平，便是俠客應該出現的時代，眞的俠客產生不出，書本上的俠客也會同樣得着歡迎。爲使心神暫時舒適下，人們是肯把書本上所述當做確有其事的。而近今的中國，正是要求俠客的時候。　　我們的兵打不過日本兵，就希望有個外國來代抱不平，卽希望俠客的出現。我們想用大刀標槍去對抗飛機大砲，就同希望有飛劍飛刀可以空中殺人，卽希望有仙法可以制勝。但一觸到實際，便有明顯的事實出來，於是武俠小說失敗了，上海要訂停戰恊定，北平也得訂停戰恊定。</p>
<p>這時候產生了一種幽默雜文的刋物，不到一年，這一類刋物又風起雲湧了。說武俠小說的地位，被這一派雜文替代，原是不對，但繼起而成爲流行扣中心，却是事實。此種雜文，大都不從正面說話，取傍敲側擊之法，用隱喻暗諷的手段來表示他的心懷，吐露他的不平。并且那個聲音也微弱得狠，有同鳴咽啜泣，而不是高聲大呼。</p>
<p>這一種轉變，不就是從以大刀對抗大砲變到含詬忍辱簽訂停戰恊定嗎？俠客旣不能出現，仙法又不見成功，那麽對於這社會上的不平，只有嗚咽怨恨一番了，這是幽默雜文繼武俠小說而流行的理由。</p>
<p>但是這種輕微的嗚咽怨署，會有什麽效果嗎？誰也不能肯定。正像簽訂停戰恊定之不是一個解决辦法一樣，是要等第二步的手段的。我們且看繼幽默雜文而起來的是什麽？是怒吼還是屈服？不但社會的趨向可以從那裏窺見，卽中國的前途，也可由此卜之。</p>

<p>— 何如</p>
<p>頃讀甲寅周刋，見孤桐先生一文，有言及陳仲甫者。略謂仲甫原名乾生，一名仲，懷寗舊家子，早歲讀書有聲。言語峻利，好爲斷制。性猖急不能容人，亦輒不見容於人。東游不得意，返於滬與愚（孤桐自謂）及滄州張溥泉，南康謝曉石，共立國民日日報。吾兩人熱居昌壽里之偏樓，對掌辭筆，足不出户，興居無節，頭面不洗，衣敝無以易，並亦不澣。一日晨起，愚見其黑色衵衣，白物星星，密不可計。愚駭然曰，仲甫，是爲何耶？仲甫徐自視，平然答曰，虱耳。其苦行類如此。此現代文人之與虱有緣者也。孤桐稱爲苦行，其在仲甫·視爲平平·未必以爲苦也。晋書王猛傳，言其氣度雄遠，細事不干其慮。桓溫入關，猛被褐而謁之，一面談當世之事，捫虱而言，旁若無人，溫察而異之。桓溫以豪傑之士生虱爲異，其在王猛，虱固細事，未必以爲異也。南齊書文學傳，卞彬才操不羣，頗好飲酒，擯棄形骸，嘗作蚤虱賦，序曰，余居貧，布衣十年不制。一袍之縕，有生所託，資其寒署，無與易之。爲人多病，起居甚疎。縈寢敗絮，不能自釋。兼攝性懈惰，懶事皮膚，澡刷不謹，澣沐失時，四時㲰㲰，加以臭穢，故葦席蓬纓之間，蚤虱猥流，淫癢渭濩，無時恕肉，探揣擭撮，日不替手。虱有諺言，朝生暮孫，若吾之虱者，無湯沐之慮，絕相弟之憂，宴聚乎久襟爛布之裳，服無改換，搯齧不能加。脫略緩懶，復不懃於捕討，孫孫息息，三十五歲焉。予意卞彬與虱相處，未能相忘，蓋擯棄形骸猶有未至，常以貧病爲慮，而無遠志者也。相傳王荆公嘗與王禹玉入朝。有虱子自荆公衣領緣至其鬚，適爲皇帝所見，不覺大笑。及退朝，荆公問禹玉曰，皇帝何笑也？禹玉曰，皇帝見相公鬚上虱子耳。荆公遽令從者去虱。禹玉曰，未可輕去，願贊一言。荆公曰，公贊云何？禹玉贊曰，屢游相鬚，曾經御覧，未可殺也，或曰放焉。同僚聞之，莫不大笑。荆公以書生而有宏抱，務其違者大者，至於囚首喪面，不暇澣洗，其與虱子有緣，宜也。</p>

<p>— 游光</p>
<p>秋已經來了，炎熱也不比夏天小，當電燈替代了太陽的時候，我還是在馬路上漫遊。</p>
<p>危險？危險令人緊張，堅張令人覺到自己生命的力。在危險中漫遊，是很好的。</p>
<p>租界也還有悠閑的處所，是住宅區。但中等華人的麗穴是炎熱的，吃食担，胡琴，麻將，留聲機，垃圾桶，光着的身子和腿。相宜的是高等華人或無等洋人住處的門外，寛大的馬路，碧綠的樹，淡色的窗幔，凉氣，月光，然而也有狗子呌。</p>
<p>我生長農村中，愛聽狗子呌，深夜遠吠，聞之神怡，古人所謂［犬聲如豹］者就是。倘或偶經生疏的村外，一聲狂嘷，巨奦躍出，也給人一種緊張，如臨戰鬥，非常有趣的。</p>
<p>但可惜在這里所聽到的是吧兒狗。牠躱躱閃閃，呌得很脆：汪汪。</p>
<p>我不愛聽這一種呌。</p>
<p>我一面漫步，一面發出冷笑，因爲我明白了使牠閉口的方法，是只要去和牠主子的管門人說幾句話，或者抛給牠一根肉骨頭。這兩件我還能的·但是我不做。</p>
<p>牠常常要汪汪。</p>
<p>我不愛聽這一種呌。</p>
<p>我一面漫步，一面發出惡笑了，因爲我手裏拿着一粒石子，惡笑剛歛，就舉手一擲，正中了牠的鼻梁。</p>
<p>嗚的一聲，牠不見了。我漫步着，漫步着，在少有的寂靜裏。</p>
<p>秋已經來了，我還是漫步着。呌呢，也還是有的，然而更加躱躱閃閃了，聲音也和先前不同，距離也隔得遠了，連鼻子都看不見。</p>
<p>我不再冷笑，不再惡笑了，我漫步着，一面舒服的聽着牠那很脆的聲音。</p>

<p>— 朱道沇</p>
<p>自從有過幾次的歉收和去年的穀賤，阿毛對於種田已覺得怕了。尤其是將到收成的時候·阿毛心裏更惴惴不安。因爲平日債主們還不打緊，但是一到了收成的時候，他們就有所藉口，緊逼着他要錢了。</p>
<p>他雖惴惴不安·但他還是懷着希望。就像今</p>
<p>年的春天·他看到田裏的麥苗靑的·心裏總感到一種莫名的喜悅。到了四月初·麥穗已纍纍然結得很豐。微風掠過·顫顫欲墜。阿毛看到這些，常發誓似地自語着：［今年的麥總不會同去年的米一樣的賤了。······我也不相信，難道他們硬要同我們種田人作籌不成］</p>
<p>他懷着這種希望，以前的勇氣就恢復了些。他暗自計算着：若是今年的麥價能同去年一樣糶五塊四角一石，那麽十六畝田，算他一石一畝，十六石也得糶八十多塊錢。雖不能把舊債完全了遣·但是也可把緊逼着的賬先還些·並且以後幾個月家裡的食用也有些着落了。他想到這裡·他的醬赤色的唇邊就掛着一絲的微笑。</p>
<p>四月底邊，阿毛很起勁的在田裡割麥。他屈着左膝，右腿向後伸着，鸞着腰，傴着背，左手握着一把麥稈，右手拿着䥥刀。䥥刀在麥　的　上一　，　　就　　　　　向　，他動在脚　　前後動此。　春的天氣　不　分　，但是阿毛　上的汗却像絡　般的滴下來，身上的靑布衫褲也全湿透了。</p>
<p>費了三個整天的工夫，阿毛和阿毛妻已把田裡的麥完全割好打好。總共收了十六石多。第四天的淸晨，阿毛就搭了人家的敝口船往鎭上去糶麥。</p>
<p>船停在米行的河埠頭。阿毛走進米行去問麥價。</p>
<p>［小麥兩塊八角。］椻台裡的夥計有聲無氣地回答。</p>
<p>［什麽！怎麽會跌到這樣厲害！去年不是糶五塊四角嗎？］阿毛聽了這名話，美滿的希望像肥皂泡樣的迸裂了。</p>
<p>［你看看現在市面上的麥要多少，現在的價錢還是好呢，等到下月大批洋麥運到時，麥價恐怕還要跌下去呢！］</p>
<p>阿毛雖覺得這樣賤的糶去，實在肉痛，│因爲單是糞錢，也得歸着一塊錢一畝；但是不糶又有什麽辦法呢？吃是要吃的，債是要還的。就是再挨幾天，聽那夥計的口氣，也没有漲的希望了。結果，阿毛的麥搬進了米行的廠間換來了和自己的預算相差很遠的一筆現欵。</p>
<p>走出行門，阿毛看着手裡的洋錢，自語似地說：［他們眞的硬要同我們種田人作難！］</p>
<p>然而阿毛口中的［他們］究竟是一些什麽人呢？</p>

<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>露仙有天在一個公園裏拾到一本自己装訂的詩集，外觀與内容都甚可愛，第二天她便依那書中所夾着的一封信的地址把它寄回給那遺失者。寄去後只來了一封短短的謝函，好心中有些不滿，接着便又寫了一封信去。可是没有回信。她不由不氣憤着對方的傲慢，氣憤了便不由不再再寫信，那樣地她繼寫了四五封。在始終得不到回信後，一天她親自去看那受信者。她看到了他，在他的門前，可是他起初否認他就是他，回頭却又承認，並請求她的寛恕。她感到了勝利的痛快，因爲他的傲慢，│她以爲那是他的傲慢，│實在已給了她太多的委屈她便報他以一封嘲弄的信，以結束那好奇的浪漫斯。</p>
<p>可是斯濱，那受信者，並不是一個肯讓自己的感情隨着人家的感情的升降的人。他所需的，他只是需要着，不問那被需要者有没有那同樣的需要，而露仙却是他所需要的。所以那封决絕的信，並不能止住他的前進。他决定了寫回信。在那回信中，他告訴她他怎樣地没有看她以前的幾封信，待看到了，他怎樣地愛上了她的好奇，撒嬌，挑撥，玩弄，敵愾；而且看到了她的人，他又怎樣地愛上了她的頭髮，眼睛，嘴唇，胸膛，腿肚。</p>
<p>在那信寫好的時候，天已在亮起來。他想把它當面送去；因爲時間太早，他便横在床上等着。可是横了下去，他便朦朧地睡着了，待醒來已是十二點多。他知道她兩點到四點在一個什麽人家教書，想索性等她教書回去後再去。他便走到了那在進行着的戯劇的第一幕佈景│那他在那裏遺失了他的詩集的公園│中去。</p>
<p>坐定了，他取出了那信來重讀着。他讀着，讀着，他感到信中有些寒酸氣。因此他消除了他那當面遞它的意思；而且要是當面交的話，她不看會使他下不來，她看也會顯出想像得到的狼狽的樣子。可是他看却依舊在去看她。他看那大鐘還只兩點才過。還有兩個鐘頭！他站起來在園中亂跑。他並在想像看那一處是他的詩集所遺留的地方。他也在想要是她的性格並没有像她的信所叙述的那麽美麗呢！不會不像的，因爲做作决做作不到這樣熱練；而且卽使是做作，那做作不就很可愛嗎？她會不會想到他的去看她？她會的，他相信，因爲她自己就是一個這樣崛强的人；也許不去才會使她失望而憤恨。</p>
<p>正如期濱所想像的，露仙寄出了那末一封信後在畏葸地希冀着他的回信，或者甚至他的來臨。她感到那信寄出得太魯莽了。他的以前的不復信總也有他的理由，該給他一個申說的機會，不能儘這樣地任性，以求一時的暢快。而且這事情是由她自己造成的，並不是對方的主動。而且，雖然在起初只有意氣，現在她似乎覺得心中有一種說不出的情意在蔓延。她想再寫一封信去，可是她的驕傲又不答應。因此她兩天以來，很是懶散，課都没有去上。</p>
<p>一到四點，斯濱就離開公園往露仙的寓所。那時露仙正同一個同居的孩子在客堂裏頑，聽到了那生疏的敲門聲，便親自去開了門。</p>
<p>［哦，你！哦，斯濱先生。］</p>
<p>［謝謝你，露仙小姐。│我可以進來嗎？］</p>
<p>［請進來，］她頓了一頓說，因爲她感到那問題的置答的不易。</p>
<p>［你，斯濱先生，你收到我那封信，我意思指那│］走進了客堂，露仙問。</p>
<p>［不肯讓我來看你的信？已經收到，可是你實在太小氣了，露仙小姐。］</p>
<p>［因爲你那麽大量，你可以······］虚線是微笑。（未完）</p>

<p>— 小之</p>
<p>在彌月酒席上</p>
<p>這是在王公館裏彌月酒席上客人們關於僱奶媽的意見。</p>
<p>當王師母笑孜孜地把她的頭胎小少爺抱出來的時候，大家當然要用贊頌而又羡慕的口氣說了［又白又嫩怪可愛］以後，王師母便坐在主人席上王先生的下首。</p>
<p>［奶水還好吧？］下巴上蓄了一掬長鬍子的陳老伯第一個問王師母。王師母把臉羞得通紅的咬着嘴唇没有回答陳老伯，只斜着眼睛望了王先生一眼；倒是王先生爽快地說：</p>
<p>［我們僱了奶媽，自己的奶還没給孩子吃過。］</p>
<p>［這個不大好，儘吃奶媽的奶，孩子長大了性情要像奶媽的。］陳老伯感觸到種族體質的問題，表示不贊成。</p>
<p>［解開衣服喂孩子奶吃，怪難爲情的······］，王師母嬌羞地解釋，［以前我常常聽同學們說：拿自己的乳汁喂孩子，是極容易毁滅自己的靑春的。］</p>
<p>［這話很有理由。］多數客人都在表示同情了，連王先生也在内；只陳老伯左臂放在椅背上，仰着頭眼睛不動釘住天花板，右手不停的捋他的鬍子，樣子好像很感慨的。</p>
<p>［其實，都是不相干的。有錢固然可以僱奶媽來［帮閒］，據說還可以保持母性的靑春美；但我們同時還應當想到：奶媽自己不生孩子是絕對没有乳汁來出賣的。在這樣事情中，我們可以很顯明的看到：奶媽賣了乳汁，便餓了她自己的孩子的肚子：那末，有錢的買了奶媽的乳汁，便等於奪了搶了刦了奶媽的孩子的食料，這條小生命就有餓死毁滅的危機和可能！······］我的話幾多次湧上了喉頭，可是始終被大魚大肉嚥壓到肚腸裏去了。</p>

<p>［二小姐，我總應該想法子來找一條能活命的生路］，隔壁武家的女傭這樣的對我說：</p>
<p>［是的，阿陳，今天你師母眞的待你太苛刻了，］我萬分同情而憐恤地答復他，</p>
<p>他看我這樣的同情，於是又接下去說：</p>
<p>［二小姐，你看，今天我一個不留心，弄破一隻碗，他駡我［白虎］［闖禍鬼］，要我滾出去，還說，有錢不會尋不到像我這樣呆手木脚的傭人······］</p>
<p>［唉！阿陳，賺錢的確是太不容易了，你現在除了替人做傭婦外，實在没有别的辦法；看在錢面上，我想你忍耐一些做着吧！］</p>
<p>阿陳依舊喪傷着臉望着我，於是我又說：</p>
<p>［你要知道，替人做工，東頭也難，西頭也難呢！］</p>
<p>［二小姐，你家的阿四也是和我一樣的傭人，他做了一點小錯事，你們一句也不駡他，我········］他嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來了。</p>
<p>［阿陳，我倒也很歡喜你到我家來做，不過······不過阿四没有什麽壞處，我們怎好歇掉他］？</p>
<p>我不忍使他失望而吱唔地說着：</p>
<p>［你想，二小姐，他們簡直當我是賊，房門鎖進鎖出；弄壞了這件事，連前幾年的事，都要一榻刮子駡起來；聲聲口口連呌我［滾蛋]，唉│這樣的生活，如何過得下去呢？］他的跟淚泉水般湧出來了。</p>
<p>［阿陳，慢慢地期待着，期待機會的來臨吧］我很聰明地對他說：［阿陳，吃點苦，苦了十年八年，積了幾個錢，那你便苦出頭了］。</p>
<p>［阿陳，阿陳，］外面的聲音傳了進來，這分明是他主婦的聲音。</p>
<p>阿陳拭了拭眼淚，連跑帶奔回去了　　我看了他的後影發怔；我便想，我又做了一次聰明人，我欺騙了她！······</p>

<p>三五成羣的歐羅巴水手，他們不斷向這神秘一角來追求。異國情緒的調和，使我心頭深深地起了一陣感觸，電影院跳舞塲······是他們徵逐浪游的處所，肉香的誘惑，色彩的動人，大和服的古装，裹着苗條的身段，任他西洋民族是如何雄武，也禁不住她們柔媚的挑逗。於是擁抱了，跳舞了，殷紅的嘴唇中，東西文化在交流。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Song Zheyuan Escorted Family to Tianjin Last Night <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan escorted his family and arrived in Tianjin at 11 PM. According to reports, he visited He [Yingqin] on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the post-military affairs of the Chahar Province, and a concrete plan has been formulated. Generally speaking, Feng [Yuxiang]'s original four armies will be reorganized into divisions within this scope. Arrangements will be made for Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Liu Guitang, and others. Duolun was indeed occupied by Li Shouxin on the night of the 13th. Whether or not a counter-offensive will be launched in the future will depend on the circumstances. He will go to Chahar in the next two or three days to handle the post-affairs. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan accompanied Feng [Yuxiang] from Zhangjiakou to Beiping yesterday. This morning, he visited He [Yingqin] to discuss the post-affairs of the Chahar situation. He also summoned personnel from the office and subordinates for a conversation. Song said that this time he went to Chahar to meet with Feng [Yuxiang] in accordance with the peaceful intentions of all parties. Fortunately, after one face-to-face discussion, the months of disputes were resolved. The two goals of persuading Feng [Yuxiang] to cancel his title and requesting him to leave Chahar were also achieved. As for the post-affairs of Chahar Province, there are many things to be dealt with, and it is definitely not something that one or two people can consider in detail. He needs to discuss it in detail with He [Yingqin] in Beiping, and after reaching an agreement, he will ask the central government for approval. There are about 40,000 to 50,000 miscellaneous troops gathered around Zhangbei and Guyuan. In the future, those with good discipline will be selected for incorporation. For example, an anti-Japanese volunteer army is led by an old man in his eighties. Due to the oppression of the Japanese army, they rose up in anger. Such people should be treated kindly to encourage them. Therefore, it is not difficult to deal with the military situation. Liu Guitang's troops are actually only one or two thousand people, all gathered near Chicheng. Fang Zhenwu has led his troops away from Wanquan and is stationed in Zhangbei. Fang himself is in Zhangjiakou. He has ordered all troops to stand by in their current locations. The troops stationed in the Duolun area are Li Shouxin's troops. Due to the aggressive attacks of the Japanese and puppet troops, communications have been disrupted for days. Li's troops may have withdrawn from Duolun. During this transition period, the heads of various departments of the Chahar Provincial Government have been temporarily replaced by personnel. The official candidates will be appointed by the central government. His return to Chahar has not yet been determined. He must wait until a substantial solution to the post-affairs problem is reached. After staying for a few days, he will return to his post. Feng [Yuxiang]'s trip to Shandong may lead him to settle in Mount Tai. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Decun came south yesterday on Feng's special train. After getting off at Xizhimen Station, he reported the current situation of Chahar Province to Xiong Bin, who then conveyed it to He Yingqin. He Yingqin did not meet with Qin Decun due to a toothache, and ordered Xiong Bin and Qin Decun to discuss it first, or propose a solution. According to some observations, the post-military affairs of Chahar Province will still take time. Now that the Japanese and puppet troops have captured Duolun, it has added a diplomatic problem. The regular meeting of the Military Affairs Commission on the 16th may bring it up for discussion. Song Zheyuan has agreed to temporarily maintain his position as Chairman of Chahar Province due to the earnest retention of Chiang [Kai-shek] and He [Yingqin]. He will still resign firmly after the post-affairs are completed. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In total, among the various armies in Chahar Province, besides the troops of Zhang Renjie and Bao Gang, whose numbers are less than 20,000, it has been decided to reorganize them into one division and one brigade respectively. Ji [Hongchang]'s troops have more than 3,000 people and are currently stationed between Duolun and Guyuan. Li Haiqing's three divisions each have six to seven thousand people, and two divisions have already been led by Zhang Yunrong. Fang Zhenwu, Sun Liangcheng, Tan Zixin and other troops have a total of more than 10,000 people and have all been transferred to Wanquan, Zhangbei, and Shangdu areas to await reorganization. Together with Liu Guitang and other bandit troops, there are only two to three thousand people in total. Song [Zheyuan] should prepare for how to reorganize and disband the various armies, as well as the resettlement after the reorganization. Furthermore, with Duolun being occupied by puppet troops again, Song [Zheyuan] feels that he cannot handle the task. In addition to recommending Pang Bingxun to succeed him as Chairman of Chahar Province, he has also requested the central government to quickly send senior officials to handle all aspects of the post-affairs together. After Song [Zheyuan] returned to Beiping last night, he originally intended to visit He [Yingqin] with Qin Decun to report and discuss everything. However, because He [Yingqin] had a tooth extracted and was resting, he could not talk much. He instructed them to discuss with Xiong Bin first, and then report to He [Yingqin]. Last night, Song, Qin, and Xiong had a long discussion on the post-affairs of the Chahar situation and have reached a general decision. This morning, Song went to Jurentang to visit He [Yingqin] to report and decided to bring it up for discussion at tomorrow's meeting of the Military Affairs Commission. Song and Qin will return to Chahar Province after the post-affairs plan has been negotiated and decided. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan is going to Tianjin tonight. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhian went to Zhangjiakou this afternoon. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The various armies north of Zhangjiakou total about 40,000 to 50,000 people, including Ji Hongchang's troops stationed in the Duolun area with about four to five thousand people, Sun Liangcheng's troops stationed in Shangdu with two to three thousand people, Tan Zixin, Li Zhongyi, Zhang Yunrong and other volunteer armies stationed in the Zhangbei area with a total of about 10,000 people, and Zhang Renjie's troops stationed in Wanquan with about 10,000 people. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan visited He Yingqin on the morning of the 15th to discuss the post-affairs of Chahar Province. Song said that Fang Zhenwu has led his troops from Wanquan to Zhangbei, and Liu Guitang's troops are in the Chicheng and Zhangbei area. There are about 40,000 to 50,000 miscellaneous troops. In the future, it is planned to select those who have made contributions to the war of resistance against Japan and have good discipline for reorganization, so as not to bury everything. After consultation with He [Yingqin], he will ask the central government for instructions and await orders to handle it. He has ordered all troops to stand by in their original defenses. The Chahar Provincial Government will be reorganized, and the candidates for the various departments have not yet been determined. At present, they are temporary replacements. He hopes that the old officials will return to Chahar to help, but it is unknown whether they will come. The post-affairs of Chahar Province cannot be discussed at the moment. Specific plans are being discussed with He [Yingqin]. The date of returning to Zhangjiakou has not been determined. It may be after the post-affairs plan is finalized. (15th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to a certain agency, Duolun fell at 10 AM on the morning of the 13th. Those who entered and occupied it were Li Shouxin's puppet troops, numbering over a thousand, several detachments of Zhang Haipeng's independent detachment, and several thousand Mongolian bandits, totaling over 10,000 people. There were also a small number of Japanese troops supervising them. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Affairs Commission previously sent a letter to the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, Chiba, stating that the Chahar situation had been resolved and requesting him to inform the Japanese government and the Kwantung Army to peacefully withdraw the troops stationed in Duolun. Chiba has forwarded our notification to the Japanese government and the Kwantung Army. As for the result, there has been no reply from the Japanese side as of today. The situation in eastern Chahar is extremely complex, and the defense is very important. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is heard that the authorities have instructed the war zone to assign Li Zeyi to be responsible for the negotiation of the Duolun incident. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Fu Rulin arrived in Beiping as Wang Jingwei's representative to express condolences to Feng [Yuxiang]. After meeting with Feng [Yuxiang] at Xizhimen yesterday, Fu Rulin boarded the train to escort him to Fengtai. He expressed the central government's hope that Feng [Yuxiang] would go to Nanjing to serve as the Director-General of Training or the Director-General of National Forestry and Land Reclamation, or the Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. They talked for more than 20 minutes. Feng [Yuxiang] expressed his willingness to rest temporarily and hoped that the central government would have a good solution for his subordinates in Chahar who resisted Japan.

After Feng [Yuxiang] resides in Tai'an, he still has a company of guards. His living expenses will be shared by Song [Zheyuan] and Han [Fuju]. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that Feng [Yuxiang] had previously received invitations from Chiang [Kai-shek] and Wang [Jingwei] and had intended to go to Nanjing.

<p>(Taiyuan) Huang Shaoxiong and Xu Yongchang arrived in Taiyuan from Beiping on the afternoon of the 15th. They were warmly welcomed by all circles. Huang Shaoxiong stayed at the Shanxi Hotel and told visitors that he had no special mission and was just traveling and meeting with Yan [Xishan]. Yan [Xishan] hosted a banquet at the Governor's Office at 5 PM to welcome Huang, Xu, and Sun Dianying. All the generals were present.

<p>(Beiping) After Huang Shaoxiong brought the plan to reorganize the various armies in North China to Beiping, he discussed it with He Yingqin several times. Because the organization of the various armies in North China is inconsistent, it is difficult to reorganize them. The authorities are now preparing to plan for a unified organization. How to implement it still needs to be discussed with the commanders of the various units. Therefore, it is difficult to implement the reorganization in the short term. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The reporter interviewed Huang Shaoxiong again. According to him, he came to Shanxi by order of Chiang [Kai-shek] and Wang [Jingwei] to discuss the post-affairs of North China with Yan [Xishan].

<p>(Beiping) He Jingwu went to the north bank of the Yellow River this morning to inspect the damage to the Yellow River Railway Bridge caused by the flood. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the report on the 12th, the deepest point of the Yellow River water at the Pinghan Railway Yellow River Bridge is 78.2 feet. The first to forty-seventh spans of the railway bridge are all silted up. The piers from the sixty-third to eighty-fourth spans have all been shaken. The water flow is still rapid. At present, the engineering section is supervising the workers to dump boulders to protect the bridge foundation. It is difficult to estimate when the traffic will resume. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Pinghan Railway Management Committee previously sent Wang Jinzhi, the director of the engineering department, to the north to inspect the Yellow River Railway Bridge. According to Wang's telegram, it is planned to dump 50,000 tons of boulders to strengthen the bridge foundation. He requested that they be taken from Jigongshan and Heishi Pass for use. (2) Liang Yongzhang, the director of the traffic department, said that the Yellow River Railway Bridge has been damaged and it may be difficult to resume traffic in the short term. In order to cope with the north-south traffic, it has been decided to separate the trains to the north and south banks after the river water recedes to a considerable extent, and then load them onto barges to cross the river for the convenience of the journey. As for how to repair the bridge, this is a major matter and requires a large amount of money. It is necessary to report to the ministry for sending personnel to inspect before starting. (3) He Jingwu arrived at Zhan Dian to inspect. Xiao Qizhen, a member of the committee, received a telegram and went north on the night of the 15th to discuss railway matters.

According to him, there are still more than 80 Japanese troops who have not withdrawn from Qian'an County. Jianchangying has a garrison headquarters and a supply station, with more than 500 troops stationed there, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yan Jiang. This place is an important route for the Japanese army to transport troops to various ports. There are currently no preparations for withdrawal.

<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming came to Tianjin from Beiping on the 15th and told reporters that Li Shoushan's puppet troops in Zunhua have withdrawn to outside the Pass. County magistrate Guan Enlin should have arrived in the county and should be able to take over within a few days. There is still a small part of the county north of the Great Wall, which is difficult to take over temporarily. The banditry in Xinglong County is rampant. There are many Qiren residents, and they have anti-Chinese sentiments. Although County Magistrate Li Ying has gone there, it is feared that it will be difficult to take over. The supplies needed by the Japanese troops at various passes of the Great Wall are handled by Japanese merchants in Pingluang. Therefore, dozens of Japanese troops are stationed in Miyun, Qian'an, and Jianchangying to transfer supplies. Liu Shisun has gone to Yu [Guan] County to negotiate with Luo He, and it should be possible to take over. The War Zone Committee will end after Yu Xuezhong returns to Tianjin.

<p>Exchange Rate for Rubles Disputed Between Russia and the Puppet State, No Decision</p>
<p>Eastern Route Council Meeting Yields No Results</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the private talks on the transfer of the China Eastern Railway, in order to determine the key exchange rate between the gold ruble and the Japanese yen for determining the price, negotiations are underway. However, regarding the exchange rate, the puppet state argues that according to the black market near Harbin, one gold ruble is about 10 Japanese cents. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, takes the pre-revolutionary valuation as the standard, arguing for 2.1 Japanese yen to counter it. As a result, it may settle at about 32.5 Japanese cents per ruble, according to the North Pacific Fisheries Agreement. (15th Electric News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet representative accepted the puppet state representative's proposal to review the issue of exchanging gold rubles for Japanese yen at the second private meeting on the Eastern Route on the 11th. Therefore, the third private meeting was originally scheduled to be held on the 15th to focus on reviewing this issue. However, due to the increasingly subtle relationship in the negotiations, both representatives took a cautious attitude and decided to postpone the third meeting on the 15th.

<p>(Harbin) The meeting between the Russian [and Manchurian] directors of the China Eastern Railway has made no progress. Discussions have been held for several days without any results. Another meeting was held today and discussed for four hours, but there is still no progress. The latest development is the demand from the [Manchurian] side, which insists that the Soviet Union should immediately accept the proposal to restrict the powers of the Russian Director-General, otherwise, it should propose a counter-proposal on which negotiations can be based. The Russian representative agreed to submit a counter-proposal, and the meeting was adjourned until August 18. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

Therefore, the business of the South Manchuria Railway Company has greatly improved, and the bonds that could not be recovered in the past have been paid in principal and interest.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Qigang, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, stated that the suffering of overseas Chinese from economic and political oppression is countless. Therefore, they are very concerned about the revitalization of the motherland. During the anti-Japanese efforts of Ma Zhanshan and the Nineteenth Route Army, overseas Chinese donated generously, even to the point of bankrupting themselves. According to Ma Zhanshan's recent report, he only received about one million in donations. According to rough estimates from various sources, the donations sent to the Northeast totaled about 20 million. The large discrepancy is noteworthy. Comrades in Shanghai who are concerned about overseas Chinese and donation efforts plan to organize a donation clearing organization to carry out clearing work. I have proposed organizing an overseas fundraising organization, which can prevent malpractices and facilitate fundraising. Although the government has organized a general donation collection office, it still cannot prevent malpractices. Now that there are such negative phenomena, it greatly affects the psychology of the people and affects future undertakings.

<h3 id="e32">Recent Developments in the Soviet Union's Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway - Ji <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since the Soviet-Manchukuo (actually Soviet-Japanese) negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway began in Tokyo, Japan on June 26th of this year, it has been a month and a half. At the start of the meeting, both sides immediately clashed fiercely over the issue of ownership and valuation of the Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union firmly insisted on its ownership of the Eastern Railway, while the Manchukuo side absolutely denied it, only acknowledging the Soviet Union's abstract joint management rights over the Eastern Railway. Regarding the valuation issue, the Soviet Union demanded 250 million gold rubles, while the Manchukuo side only agreed to 50 million Japanese yen. The positions of both sides were vastly different. Since then, although meetings have been held repeatedly, a total of six times, the Soviet Union has only agreed to reduce the price by 50 million. According to recent telegrams, the Soviet Union and Manchukuo are in disagreement over the exchange rate between gold rubles and Japanese yen, and there is still no possibility of a rapprochement. At the same time, Japan is actively making military preparations in northern Manchuria, declaring that if negotiations break down, Manchukuo will forcibly seize the Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union is also on high alert on its Far Eastern border, with swords drawn and bows bent, creating a tense atmosphere. The Soviet-Manchukuo negotiations on the sale of the railway have clearly fallen into an irreconcilable deadlock. Unless the Soviet Union is willing to make a major concession, the dispute will be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Japan's desire to seize the Eastern Railway is undoubtedly a further manifestation of Japanese imperialism's search for a way out. Currently, capitalist countries around the world are suffering deeply from the dangerous assault of economic panic. Although each capitalist country has exhausted methods to try to contain the advance of this surge, the result is not only ineffective, but they are becoming increasingly bogged down. Under these circumstances, the only way out for capitalism is to compete for markets, re-divide colonies, and prepare for war. Japan is a pioneer of this doctrine, so in the midst of extreme global economic panic, it seized our Northeast with lightning speed. Japan knows full well that this monopolistic action will not be tolerated by other European and American countries, but it also knows that the intricate and complex contradictions between the capitalist countries of the world have not yet been resolved, and there will definitely be no immediate intervention against Japan. Therefore, it dares to act decisively without hesitation. As a result, Britain and France have remained silent towards Japan, and the United States has not taken any active action other than "podium diplomacy." The reactions of the capitalist countries of the world to Japan are exactly as Japan expected. However, the Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union's last stronghold in the Eastern Provinces, still stands in the way, preventing them from seizing it. This is a great obstacle to Japan's overall policy of aggression in our Northeast. Now that the World Economic Conference has ended, the economic struggles and arms races between the capitalist countries have intensified with the demise of the World Economic Conference. International capitalism has clearly embarked on a new path of struggle, which is to intensify preparations for a second world war. Japan recognizes this situation and must accelerate the extension of its influence into northern Manchuria, firstly to complete its base in the Northeast, and secondly to win the favor of other capitalist countries with the anti-Soviet banner in order to support its ultimate destiny. Therefore, it has taken action to seize the Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>The significance of Japan's desire to seize the Eastern Railway is as described above. So why did the Soviet Union decide to sell the Eastern Railway to Japan? And why, having decided to sell it, did it refuse to concede on various issues, leading to an irreconcilable deadlock in the negotiations? This can be understood without further explanation. The reason why the Soviet Union decided to sell the Eastern Railway to Japan is simply that, in view of the encirclement by capitalist countries around the world, it is well aware that under these two clearly opposing conditions, given the Soviet Union's current capabilities, it cannot afford to risk starting a war lightly with capitalist countries. The reason why it is unwilling to make as many concessions as possible in the railway sale negotiations is that the contradictions between capitalist countries in the world today cannot be harmonized in the short term. The Soviet Union's current diplomacy is very favorable and sufficient to increase its strength. Therefore, if it can avoid making concessions, the Soviet Union will not make them rashly. This is why the Soviet Union has repeatedly insisted on its position in the meetings.</p>
<p>From this, the future trend of the Soviet-Manchukuo negotiations on the sale of the railway can be known. In terms of the overall world situation, if the Eastern Railway issue leads to a disadvantageous position for the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union will still have to make concessions. Conversely, if the international situation does not cause any disadvantage to the Soviet Union due to the Eastern Railway issue, then the transfer negotiations may not be resolved for some time. Some say that Japan will now take direct action and forcibly seize the Eastern Railway by force. At that time, what will the Soviet Union do? According to our observations, the Soviet Union will still have to retreat. We do not see its possibility of waging war against Japan. Although a second world war is inevitable in the near future, whether it is a war between capitalist groups or a war between capitalism and socialism, the Soviet Union will certainly be a key player in the war. This is what can be asserted.</p>

<p>Havana: The new Cuban President, Cespedes, has formed a new cabinet and held its first meeting today. Cespedes is concurrently serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In order to restore order throughout the island, the military authorities have adopted resolute measures for the current situation. Today, they have ordered the people to disarm. All those who rob property, commit arson, and generally disturb the peace will be killed without mercy. According to general observations, the Acting President ignored the demands of the old political parties when organizing the new cabinet. All former President Machado's partisans have now left Cuba.

<p>Havana: The new Cuban cabinet was sworn in today. Many striking workers have also returned to work. Food supplies in the capital have been replenished, and ice was delivered today. People in the outer provinces are also resuming work. The revolutionary army in the mountain region has not taken any new actions. Officials in all provinces have pledged their support for the new government. Former President Machado is rarely mentioned today. His Liberal Party is now enthusiastically supporting the new President. The Presidential Palace has been cleaned up after the looting by mobs on Sunday. Most of the items looted were Machado's personal belongings. Furniture and equipment were not severely damaged. The new President will meet with bankers and industrialists tomorrow to discuss the basis of financial policy. (Guomin dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Havana: The new Cuban government has quickly restored order today, enabling the country to return to its former state. Therefore, the American warship Claxton has been ordered to leave Havana tonight. It is expected that the destroyer Taylor will receive the same order tomorrow. The two ships were sent to Cuba to assist the new government in restoring order, but according to US Ambassador Welles today, there is no need for assistance at this time. However, the two ships will still be anchored in Guantanamo Bay, where there is a US naval station, so that they can be dispatched immediately if needed. The US Navy Department had transferred the cruiser Richmond from Panama to Mencaniejo (in Oriente Province), but this order was also cancelled. (Guomin dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Havana: Today, there were clashes between mobs and secret police here, and 12 secret police officers were killed. Acts of retaliation have occurred throughout the country, too numerous to list. The authorities are now taking resolute plans to restore order, so Cuba is now rapidly returning to normal. Commercial activity has also resumed. However, port workers are still on strike. The military authorities have ordered a ban on demonstrations and parades, and on carrying weapons. It is expected that the new government will have close relations with the United States. The Cuban people are optimistic about the future, believing that the United States will have a new approach to tariffs and debts. Today, some US Marines landed here. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Havana: Two of former President Machado's hometown properties were looted by mobs. The former President's associates who failed to escape are now hastily preparing to leave Cuba. The authorities have now ordered the military to shoot and kill anyone who disrupts public order. A curfew is in effect every day after 10 PM. All carrying of weapons and demonstrations are strictly prohibited. Today, six members of the former President's family arrived in Key West, Florida, on the Presidential yacht from Havana. Former Minister of War General Herrera, along with his wife and two children, also fled Cuba today by ship to Jamaica. They boarded the ship from their hiding places under the protection of military personnel and US Ambassador to Cuba Welles. The protection along the way was extremely tight, with soldiers carrying machine guns escorting them on motorcycles to the boarding point. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Hoping to Provoke a Japanese-American War</p>
<p>(Tokyo) During today's continued trial of young naval officers involved in the May 15th incident last year by the military court, it was discovered that the conspirators had seriously considered assassinating the American ambassador to Tokyo, a certain American consul, General Ugaki, and several naval admirals, and attacking Tokyo with naval aircraft. Their aim in assassinating the American ambassador was to provoke a Japanese-American war, in order to eliminate liberals in the army and navy and consolidate the power of the anti-reform faction. Their aim in attacking Tokyo with aircraft was to create chaos and establish a military government. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Today, the Labour Party's Daily Herald reported that if the disarmament conference fails, Britain is determined to expand its air force. If Geneva cannot agree on limiting the world's air forces, Britain will build hundreds of new high-speed pursuit aircraft and increase the number of seaplanes for the navy. The design of the new aircraft has been prepared, and its funding will be included in the budget submitted to Parliament in November. The newspaper criticized this plan in detail, stating that it would create a new era of international sky competition. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 14th - President Roosevelt discussed today with General Johnson the events that have been accomplished under the National Recovery Act, and then convened a meeting of the members of the Recovery Administration to inquire whether various efforts have been held simultaneously. Johnson urged the people in St. Louis last night to seek trade under the "Blue Eagle." It is heard that the President expressed agreement with his proposal. Estimates of the number of people who have found work since the start of the recovery movement vary, from as few as 200,000 to as many as a million.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th - The Secretary-General of the League of Nations has invited 27 major wheat importing and exporting countries to participate in the conference initiated by the World Economic Conference to be held in London on August 21. The League of Nations' move is in response to the requests of Argentina, Australia, the United States, and Canada, so these four countries are not among the 27 countries. It is generally believed that these four countries have formed a temporary agreement on the condition of convening this meeting.</p>

<p>Guomin, Riga, 14th - The fascist tide seems to have spread to Latvia.

<h3 id="e41">Tense Situation in Estonia <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Guomin, Reval, 14th - The situation in Estonia is becoming increasingly dangerous. After the government declared a state of emergency in the country, it disbanded various military organizations today, including the headquarters of the Estonian Freedom Fighters, who support National Socialism, and restricted public gatherings, meetings, and freedom of speech in newspapers. Political observers say that this plan may not be effective, because the Freedom Fighters have already gained the support of the majority of the people.</p>
<p>Reval: The Estonian government has decided to build two submarines and several new torpedo boats in the near future. The government recently sold two torpedo cruisers to the Peruvian government for 4.1 million yuan, which is not enough to cover the cost of the new ships. Therefore, it plans to raise another public bond to make up for the shortfall. (Guomin dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Opening of the Fifth Pan-Pacific Academic Conference</p>

<p>Efforts to Avoid Detailed Discussion of Chinese-Japanese Disputes</p>
<p>Hu Shi's Speech Condemns Various Countries' Competition in Naval Armaments</p>
<p>British and Japanese Representatives Speak Against Each Other on Trade War</p>
<p>The Pan-Pacific Academic Conference opened here today. Judging from the current situation, the conference seems likely to be uneventful, unless some representatives only want to discuss the more contentious issues affecting the Far East. Canadian representative Falconer welcomed the representatives at the opening ceremony, saying that the Pacific countries should strive to establish a friendship similar to that between the United States and Canada. He believed that this conference would help to realize this friendship. Judging from the conversations in the lounge, it seems that the leaders of the conference have tried to create an agenda that will not provoke fierce debates. According to some representatives, the relations between China and Japan are enough to cause intense disputes, so some issues will be avoided if possible. If unlimited debates are conducted on the Far Eastern issue in some areas, it may endanger the life of the conference. The status of Soviet Russia in the Far East may also not be discussed in detail, because Canadian law prohibits communists from entering the country, and Soviet Russia has not sent a representative to the conference. Even the Manchurian issue, although some representatives have tried to raise it, may not be discussed in detail, and the outcome is unknown. (Guomin dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The Fifth Pan-Pacific Academic Conference was held here today. The issues discussed include maritime arms in the Pacific, restrictions on tariffs and trade, agreements on international commodities, shipping subsidies, Philippine independence, and the US law prohibiting the entry of Easterners. Representatives from countries related to the Pacific are attending. Sir Wilton, a non-official member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and Mr. Woodhead, an Englishman from Shanghai, also came to participate. Chairman Falconer expressed his confidence that the work of the conference would be successful today, and spoke about the relationship between Canada and the United States, saying that if someone attacked Canada, the result would be that the United States would join Canada's side and take action if a non-British person gained a position in Canada. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Pengfu: Chinese representative Hu Shi spoke at the opening day of the Pan-Pacific Academic Conference, condemning the various countries' competition in naval armaments. He said that the ship-building plans that the United States has implemented and is negotiating with various countries are bound to destroy the peace machinery that has been built with hard work for decades. A few years ago, countries strongly urged the dismantling of war tools, but now they have turned to dismantling peace tools, which is regrettable. Japanese representative Nitobe spoke, strongly stating that the economic war is intensifying, and the danger is worrying. It is necessary to have a reasonable adjustment between countries, implicitly referring to the increased tariffs on non-British goods in British colonies and the US economic plan. British representative, former High Commissioner of Palestine, Samuel, claimed that Britain, in the Far East, apart from maintaining its original trade, only wants to promote the security of the region. Britain does not want to obtain special interests, especially not interfering. (Guomin dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>California Chamber of Commerce Passes Resolution</p>
<p>Reversing Previous Stance</p>
<p>San Francisco: The California Chamber of Commerce in the United States passed a resolution today advocating that the US Congress repeal the clauses in the immigration law that reject Eastern nationalities, and give Eastern nationalities the same immigration quota. Because California has always been the strongest opponent of Eastern nationalities immigrating to the United States, this time, the state Chamber of Commerce organized a special committee to conduct a detailed study of this issue from all aspects, and made a resolution in favor, which can greatly promote the newly emerging movement to allow Eastern immigrants. According to the Chamber of Commerce directors, if the Eastern nationalities are given immigration quotas according to current laws, Japanese people can immigrate to the United States at a rate of 185 people per year, and Chinese people can immigrate at a rate of 105 people per year. This small matter will not have harmful consequences for the labor community, and its impact will be sufficient to improve international relations and increase trade. The current movement has spread to the Atlantic coast of the United States. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e44">Reports on the Formation of the Silver Agreement <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>It is Expected that Congress Will Approve the Increase in Silver Prices</p>
<p>Highly Praises China and Mexico for Abandoning Selfish Interests as Commendable</p>
<p>Guomin, Washington, 13th - US Senator Pittman met with the President to report on the situation of silver discussions at the World Economic Conference. After leaving the White House, he met with reporters and claimed that the price of silver would eventually return to 60 cents per ounce. It is expected that the United States will pass the silver agreement concluded at the Economic Conference in January next year. Pittman believes that the price of silver can be increased through various activities, and even relying solely on the federal government's purchases, it can rise. Currently, 66 countries have approved the silver plan, and signed the silver resolution, opposing the destruction of silver coins and supporting the promotion of the monetary use of silver. He expects that the countries signing the silver agreement will begin purchasing silver at the beginning of next year, and believes that these signatory countries will soon use some silver as currency collateral. If all countries pay as much attention to raising the price of silver as they do to raising commodity prices, silver will definitely return to its previous price. He also said that the United States' future export trade will mainly focus on the Far East and South America, both of which widely use silver, so the increase in the price of silver may be more beneficial to the United States than to other countries. The Economic Conference was able to pass the silver proposal and conclude a five-nation agreement thanks to the cooperation of Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Mexican Finance Minister Bani. All the representatives recognized their views on the silver issue as correct and sound. They did not make any demands for the selfish interests of one country, and strived to achieve universal agreement and seek the welfare of the world. Such facts as China's sacrifice of the right to sell silver and Mexico's purchase of silver are all commendable. Mexican Finance Minister Bani also returned home after attending the London meeting, and after arriving in Washington today, he also shared the same views on the price of silver as Pittman.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Censorate's impeachment of Zhao Qilu, 1. Once an impeachment case has been delivered to the Disciplinary Committee, the person involved should await notification and submit a defense. It is not as if there is no opportunity for appeal. Gu Zhutong's submission of a petition to the Executive Yuan before the case was formally established is not only unprecedented in legal procedure, but also shows contempt for the spirit of judicial independence. 2. The defense argued that the 351st meeting of the Central Political Committee on April 5th urged the National Government to promptly establish a special court for punishing corruption, based on a resolution of the Central Political Committee forwarded by the Jiangsu Provincial Government via the Executive Yuan, stating that corrupt county magistrates could be kept in Beijing and handled after the special court was established. However, it has been found that the resolution of the 351st meeting was based on the 308th resolution of the Central Political Committee and was a further reminder, unrelated to this case. 3. It has recently been reported that two-thirds of the county magistrates appointed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government are unqualified. This is a new fact discovered after the impeachment case was transferred. The Censorate is currently considering whether to submit another accusation to the Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials based on the above reasons, in accordance with the law.

<p>Austrian Newspaper Publishes Special Edition</p>
<p>Revealing the Inside Story of Activities</p>
<p>(Reuters, Vienna, 14th) Today, the government organ [Federal Post] published a special edition containing detailed plans devised by the German National Socialist Party to subdue Austria and seize Austrian industry and commerce, with a headline in extremely large characters reading, [Conspiracy Against Austria]. According to the newspaper, this plan was discovered in mail being inspected, proving that Germany is currently using the German Embassy in Vienna to illegally transmit information. The most noteworthy document contained therein is a memorandum from German Baron Sigler, advocating granting Austria commercial benefits to win the favor of Austrians. It is said that imposing a forced peace on a conquered Austria is inconceivable. This would only arouse Austrian patriotism, and Germany may not be able to win a war in the new era. Therefore, instead of Germany swallowing up Austrian industries that have become Frenchified and Westernized, they should be enticed with the hope of prosperity through German trade.</p>
<p>(Havas, Vienna, 15th) Yesterday, the semi-official mouthpiece [Federal Post] published various documents proving that the German Embassy in Austria is responsible for relaying messages for the Austrian National Socialist Party. The newspaper believes that this fact, along with the German flights into Austrian territory to distribute leaflets and the use of radio to broadcast propaganda attacking the Austrian government, is of the same nature, proving that Germany continues to carry out movements to disrupt Austrian security. It demanded that the Austrian government determine its position on this matter. The socialist mouthpiece Labor Daily even asked the government to demand that Germany recall its ambassador.</p>
<p>(Havas, Vienna, 15th) Yesterday, Knos, leader of the Austrian National Socialist Party in the Styria province, delivered a radio broadcast speech in the German city of Seng, attacking the Dollfuss government. A phonograph record of the speech was made, and today the German Presslau radio station rebroadcast Knos's speech. Austrian public opinion was extremely indignant at the content of the speech.</p>
<p>(Havas, Vienna, 14th) It has been widely rumored that secret envoys from various German and Austrian factions are conducting negotiations to ease relations between the two countries. However, according to responsible sources, this news is unreliable, as the Austrian government has not been informed of this matter, and no individual official has been authorized to participate in these negotiations.</p>

<p>Issue of Sovereignty Over Small Island Arises</p>
<p>(Reuters, Geneva, 14th) Last week, members of the German National Socialist Party crossed into Swiss territory in Basel to search for communists. Now, another case has occurred, which Swiss newspapers are paying close attention to. Last night, German customs officials detained two Swiss workers who were camping on a small island in the Rhine River near Basel. It has been verified that the island did not display any signs prohibiting landing, and the sovereignty of the island has not yet been clarified. The Germans claim that it is definitely German territory, so Swiss tourists have no right to land on the island, and they accuse them of being communists, using the island to spread inflammatory writings. Both workers were carrying communist newspapers and have been imprisoned in a German jail. The Swiss authorities are very concerned about this case and are currently investigating it.</p>

<p>Major Concession to Cooperative Farmers</p>
<p>(Reuters, Moscow, 15th) Soviet Russian Communist Party Secretary General Stalin and People's Commissar Chairman Molotov signed an order allocating 35 million rubles to purchase one million head of cattle to supply to rural farmers. In the future, members of Soviet Russian cooperatives will be allowed to own their own cattle. This move is inconsistent with common communist principles and shows a major concession by the Soviet Russian authorities to cooperative farmers. The farmers are dissatisfied with forced collectivization and would rather kill their cattle for food than donate them to the Soviets.</p>

He arrived in Guling that day and met with Chiang, Huang Fu, Li Liejun, and others to discuss matters, 1. The suppression of the Red Army in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong, especially the Zhu-Mao faction in Jiangxi, which has been causing trouble in the southeast for seven years. A comprehensive decision has been made to use military and political forces to achieve short-term pacification. 2. The allocation and use of the American wheat loan. Experts have been hired to participate in the design, and Chiang, Wang, and others have made a general decision, which will be passed by the Central Government before it can be implemented. 3. The situation in Chahar. Wang and Chiang hope that Feng will quickly relinquish the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Army and preferably come to Beijing to support the overall situation. Otherwise, he should be assigned to another position to show unity. Li Xiehe and Chen Shu also offered many opinions, and Wang and Chiang adopted many of them. The results of the discussion will be conveyed to Feng by Li to seek his agreement. 4. The aftermath of the received war zones and various military and political issues in North China. Wang and Chiang, along with Huang Fu and others, have reviewed and refined the previous agreements, which will be implemented separately by the Peiping Political Committee and the Military Branch Committee. Wang and Chiang also discussed and determined other important political matters related to domestic affairs, foreign affairs, and everything else. (August 13th evening)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Peiping-Yulin Traffic Restored <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>=Passenger and Freight Trains Reach Yuguan Directly on the 13th=</p>
<p>=Liu Shisun Says Difficulties Still Abound in Luandong=</p>
<p>(Peiping Correspondence) The Peiping-Yulin railway traffic issue has been settled with the Japanese side, and it is allowed to be realized today (13th). The Peiping East Railway Station has received a telegram order from the Tianjin General Bureau stating that, starting from 5 AM today (13th), the ordinary passenger trains No. 7 and No. 8 departing from Peiping will directly reach Yuguan. Freight trains No. 19 and No. 20 will also depart from Tangshan to Yuguan. Tomorrow (14th), passenger trains No. 3 and No. 4 and Luan coal trains No. 13, 14, and 15 will be added. The day after tomorrow (15th), special express trains No. 101 and 102 will be added again. All passenger and freight trains will resume as usual. Personnel from all stations east of Tangshan on the pseudo-Fengshan Railway retreated to the section outside Yuguan on the last train last night (12th). Counting from the fall of Yuguan and the interruption of Peiping-Yulin trains until today's resumption of traffic, it has been suspended for seven months and ten days. All losses are being estimated. The original text of the notice posted at the Qianmen Railway Station yesterday is recorded as follows: [Starting from the 13th of this month, train services between Qianmen and Shanhaiguan will be fully restored as follows: Trains No. 7 and 8 will start operating between Qianmen and Yuguan from the 13th of this month. Trains No. 3 and 4 will start from the 14th of this month. Trains No. 9 and 10 and No. 101 and 102 will start from the 15th of this month. All trains connecting to the seaside from Beidaihe will operate according to the original schedule. This announcement.]</p>
<p>War zone reception commissioners Yin Tong, Liu Shisun, and Lei Shourong arrived in Peiping from Tangshan by the same train at 10 PM the night before. After getting off the train, they returned to their residences to rest separately. Yesterday (12th) at around 11 AM, Yin, Liu, Lei, and Tao Shangming and others went to the Jurentang to visit He Yingqin to report on the war zone reception and the progress of contacting Peiping-Yulin traffic. They only left at 12:30 PM. According to Liu Shisun's remarks, [The issue of restoring traffic on the Tangshan-Yulin section of the Peiping-Yulin Railway has been satisfactorily resolved after Commissioner Yin went to Bin and contacted Colonel Hougong. Therefore, they returned to Peiping yesterday to report on the progress of the contact. Our side has now decided to restore the direct passenger trains between Peiping and Yuguan on the 13th. Takazaki, the commander of the Japanese military line area stationed in Tangshan, retreated to outside the pass early this morning (12th) at 9 AM. All of the Japanese Kwantung Army between Tangshan and Yuguan has also been completely withdrawn. Only a portion of the garrison troops are stationed between Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, and Yuguan. Commissioner Yin's negotiations with the Japanese side this time were entirely based on the restoration of traffic plan set at the Dalian meeting and did not involve political issues. The result of their discussions is that the first step is to restore the railway traffic to the state before the incident. After the traffic is restored, the second step is to proceed with other matters such as joint transportation. As for the Linyu Customs issue, after negotiations, the Japanese side also agreed to hand it over to our side for reception tomorrow (13th). The Linyu county government is still working at Haiyangling because the pseudo-organs in the city have not been completely closed. In Linyu city, there are maintenance associations organized by pseudo-organizations, such as the Yulin Transport Office, telegraph and telephone, etc. Although the county town is small, it is full of organs, all of which are presided over by Japanese garrison commander Ochiai. It is also in the process of closing down. The issue of the county government moving back after Peiping-Yulin traffic is restored can be resolved. In the future, Yuguan will be guarded by our police, and the number of people has been determined to be 300. Shi Yusan's troops have arrived in Yutian County and are starting to reorganize the security team, with a quota of 1,000 people, led by Hu Xiewu. There is no trace of Shi Yusan's troops in the Qinhuangdao Yuguan area. After Shi's troops are reorganized, it has been decided to carry out road repairs and bandit suppression first. The counties in Luandong have basically completed the reception, but there are still small problems. There are many difficulties in the future, and we can only continue to handle them. Although Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng have been internally designated as administrative inspectors for Luandong and Peipingbei, they have not yet been announced. The implementation of all administrative aftermaths in Luandong requires active reorganization and is of great importance. The county magistrates have heavy responsibilities, and it seems that the administrative inspector is too weak to manage. I am scheduled to go to Yuguan again the day after tomorrow (14th) to observe and handle the handover of the Linyu county government.] (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Yellow River Flood Reaches Western Shandong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>=Area West of Heze and Cao is a Vast Expanse of Water=</p>
<p>=Kao County Dyke Breach Sends Water to Shandong as Well=</p>
<p>=Northern Shandong Canal Suddenly Surges=</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The Yellow River has experienced high water flows due to heavy rains in Shaanxi. In the territory of Changyuan County, Hebei Province, there were sudden breaches of multiple mouths on both the north and south banks, each several miles wide, and the floodwaters rushed down. The water on the north bank reached Ermencun today (13th) and will reach Puxian, Shandong Province in one or two days. The officials and people of the county are currently making every effort to prevent and control the flood. The water exiting on the south bank flowed into Heze in western Shandong yesterday, causing alarming news to spread and stirring up unrest. The natives of Cao Prefecture living in Jinan are particularly anxious due to the immediate suffering. Telegrams and letters of inquiry are pouring in like snowflakes. This is truly a natural disaster that has rarely occurred in Shandong in recent years. According to the River Affairs Bureau today (13th), a telegram report from Heze County Magistrate Sun Zerang stated that the Yellow River water entering Shandong had reached west of Heze, dividing into two streams. One stream flows northwest from Guanyuanji towards Wudian north of the city, and the other stream passes Weilu through Gaozhuangji, also heading towards Wudian, merging into one. The water entering Cao County has also reached the Weiwan area on the western border of Cao County, also dividing into two streams, one towards the south of Cao County City, and the other towards the north of Cao County City. The water situation is unclear. In addition, the upstream general section chief Chen Tianmo and others also telegraphed that the south bank of the Yellow River dyke at Yanmiao, about eight li from Kao County, Henan Province, also breached on the 11th, with a width of several tens of meters, and the flow was turbulent. The southern part of Heze and the northern part of Cao County in Shandong Province are both disaster areas. The following is a record of each report: 1. Sun Zerang's telegram stated, "On the morning of the 1st, the water head had reached the western border of Heze, dividing into two streams. One stream flows northwest from Guanyuanji towards Wudian north of the city, and the other stream passes Weilu through Gaozhuangji towards Wudian. I have been working hard for days, together with the principals of various rural schools and the students of the self-defense teams, to help the villagers protect the dangerous works at Liuzhuang and Zhukou, and at the same time desperately repairing and blocking the dykes on both sides of the waterways, so that the water flow can be discharged. According to reconnaissance reports, the water from Cao County has also reached the Weiwan area on the western border of Cao County, also dividing into two streams, one towards the south of Cao County City, and the other towards the north of Cao County City. The water situation is unclear. Heze County Magistrate Sun Zerang kowtows." 2. Chen Wenmo's telegram stated, "According to a telephone report from Erfenzhuang in Hebei, the dyke on the south bank of Yanmiao, about eight li downstream from Kaocheng, Henan Province, breached on the Zhen day, with a width of about several tens of meters, and the flow was very turbulent. The southern part of Heze and the northern part of Cao County in this province are all disaster areas," etc. Based on this, it is appropriate to report it by telegram. Chen Wenmo, Zhao Rongfu, kowtow.</p>
<p>The Yellow River's major flooding this year first submerged Shaanxi and Shanxi, and recently has affected Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces. The counties in western Shandong, such as Heze, are busy with prevention and control, and the northern Shandong Canal has also suddenly surged. Today (13th), the Shandong Civil Affairs Department received a report from the De County Magistrate stating that the water level suddenly rose by more than three feet last night, leaving only four feet before reaching the top of the dyke, and the situation is extremely dangerous. They are currently supervising the militia to work together to prevent and control the flood. After receiving the telegram, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun reported it to the provincial government and notified the Construction Department, and at the same time telegraphed the county magistrate to do his best to defend.

<h3 id="e77">Chongming Seawall in Danger <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>=The Vortex in Front of Qinglong Dam is Forty-Five Meters Deep=</p>
<p>=Local Groups Have Sent Representatives to the Province to Petition=</p>
<p>Chongming is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, surrounded by the sea on all sides, and is the throat of the Yangtze River and an important place for coastal defense. During the Qing Dynasty, it was where the Su, Song, and Chang General Zhen was stationed, with forts built in its subordinate towns and fortresses. It was abolished after the reforms. In the past, the British went to investigate and were willing to exchange it for Weihaiwei. When the January 28th Incident occurred, more than twenty Japanese warships were moored along its southern coast (ie, Liuhe Baimao Port), and they even landed in the county to buy goods, so there was a rumor that it had been lost. The island was established as a county during the Song Dynasty, but due to the erosion of the river, it has collapsed and expanded frequently, and the county government has been moved five times. During the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, in the 20th and 26th years, local people successively requested funds to build a stone seawall more than a thousand zhang long south of the city, and the people donated 5,000 mu of sandy land, named Seawall Public Land, as the annual repair fund for the wall. It has been safe for more than thirty years. In the 17th year of the Republic, Waisha County (ie, today's Qidong) was split off from the county. As a result, all public property was divided item by item. There was a dispute over the aforementioned seawall public land. Later, the Jiangsu Provincial Government mediated, and the Finance Department subsidized Chongming and Qidong counties each with 5,000 yuan per year, and the fields were divided equally. Although the case was decided, it has not been implemented to date. Last year, people from Chongming and Qidong counties requested to merge, but the case was shelved by the provincial government. Recently, the No. 2 seawall south of the county town is extremely dangerous. The Construction Department sent a guiding engineer to measure it. The vortex in front of the Qinglong Dam is forty-five meters deep, and the width is almost a mile. The stone embankment has collapsed more than twenty zhang. The estimated repair project will cost more than 100,000 yuan, causing public panic. The county party department took the lead in sending a telegram to the province requesting relief. Various groups such as the County Farmers' Association and local gentry Wang Qingmu, Zhu Songhan, etc., jointly submitted a petition to the province requesting the issuance of outstanding subsidies and the seawall public rent divided by Qidong County to repair it, and sent Cheng Tiuyun, a member of the County Executive Committee, and Tao Zhu, director of the Property Office, to the province to petition the provincial government and the two departments of finance and construction. During the great flood this month, another three zhang of the stone embankment collapsed, and pedestrians are now detouring.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Water Level in Qingjiang Canal Continues to Rise by Seven Inches <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the water level in the canal has been rising and falling repeatedly. Yesterday (the 12th), the water level rose by another seven inches. Together with the three inches that rose the day before yesterday, it has risen by a foot in total. The water level in the Qingjiang Sluice Gate was originally 2 zhang, 3 chi, and 9 cun, but it has now risen to 2 zhang, 4 chi, and 9 cun. Those involved in river affairs here said that the rise in water this time mostly comes from Shandong, which is commonly known as the Yi River. If the weather can clear up, even if it is the Yi River, there will not be any danger.</p>

<p>The Jin Si Niang Bridge in this county has always been an area where bandits appear. The day before yesterday, a large number of smuggling boats were exporting goods. The tax police stationed in the area learned of this and dispatched a squad led by squad leader Li to pursue them. The smugglers, seeing that the police force was small, resisted. The two sides exchanged fire for about an hour. Li's squad was defeated and returned, and five rifles were lost. The batch of smuggling boats then escaped. Afterwards, Li telegraphed the Liang Yuanhua district squad. District Captain Huang received the report and drove to Zha Pu yesterday, mobilizing all the officers and soldiers of the 6th Detachment of the Zha Pu tax police to pursue them. They caught one smuggling boat, and the five rifles that had been seized were also inside the boat, so they towed it back and reprimanded Squad Leader Li, ordering him to find out the origins of the smuggling gang in order to suppress them.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Major Suspect Arrested in Hangzhou Kidnapping and Murder Case <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After the kidnapping of Sun Hongwen, the three-year-old son of Sun Xijun, the owner of the Qian Yuan Sugar Shop at No. 32 Longshezui, Jiang Qianxiang in this city, and the shooting of the car driver Qian Jingchun on Wansongling, the military and police agencies immediately dispatched a large number of military and police to investigate and arrest the perpetrators separately. From today (15th), a search of the mountains will be carried out. Unexpectedly, at about 5:00 AM this morning, Inspector Kong Yuesheng of the First Branch Bureau led a number of police officers to search Wugong Mountain and arrested Cao Youcheng, a suspect who was considered to be extremely important, in the Wugong Temple. Because he spoke evasively, the suspect was taken to the First Branch Bureau for questioning. According to his confession, he was from Xinchang, 36 years old, and had served as a senior officer in the Zhenhai Fortress. He came to Hangzhou because of a lawsuit. Later, a note was found beside him, which read: "If the money is not paid by the 13th, people will be beaten and houses will be burned." The accountant of the Zhejiang Fujiang Motor Company and the mother of the hostage went to identify him and confirmed that he was indeed the bandit who hired the car that day. The suspect was wearing a white cloth shirt and was calm. He firmly denied the bandit case and claimed that he was introduced by his friend Song Aquan to stay at the temple. The police were dispatched to No. 42 and No. 30 Baimao Temple Alley to arrest six suspected criminals, including Song Aquan, Song Wangshi, Fang Tingxiu, and Song Qian, both male and female. They are being taken into custody for strict interrogation.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th at 11:30 PM, more than ten pirates suddenly came to the home of Xu Zhengtang, a resident of Qian'ao Township, Jiangshan, Yin County. Xu Zhengtang and his son, Fuxing, who had served as police, escaped through the back door and crossed the river, fortunately avoiding disaster. Only more than 80 silver dollars and a few pieces of jewelry were robbed. After the robbery, the bandits went to the home of Xu Xingchao, a neighbor, to rob again and kidnapped Xu Xingchao, his eleven-year-old son, Shengfu, and his nephew, Zhang Xiaodou. At that time, a hired worker, Yan A Ming, came out to look, and was hacked to death by the bandits.</p>

<p>A gang of bandits of more than 100 people led by Ma Dianwen, who were entrenched in the Sujia Lane area, burned and looted the two villages of Sunying and Nanlu on the 12th. Most of them moved north and sneaked into the Eight Jiang Camps (composed of villages) in the border area of ​​Anhui that night, ambushing in the sorghum fields. When each camp opened its gates at dawn, they took advantage of the situation to enter. Squadron leader Jiang Wenhua led the villagers to resist, but they were eventually defeated. Eight villages fell one after another. After investigation, the villages were almost completely burned down. In addition to looting more than a dozen women and seizing more than 20 guns, many strong men died. The situation was tragic.</p>

One was with the people outside the door, and two went straight into the backyard, claiming to be looking for something. They wrapped Kaoshan in a sheet and carried him out of the bed. Li was shocked and shouted wildly. The bandits fired a shot and slipped into the alley, exiting the street from the back door. By the time the military and police arrived after hearing the news, the bandits had disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>Since Dong Xiaohou and others organized the Xingye Fish Farming Cooperative at Baimahu in Xixiang, Xiaoshan, and the fish have been raised under official supervision, all nearby fishermen are not allowed to catch fresh fish in the lake privately. On the 11th of this month, two daughters of a fisherman named Chen from a nearby village were catching shrimp and fish along the lake when they were spotted by the cooperative's managers, who overturned their fishing boat, drowning a thirteen-year-old girl. This aroused the anger of all the fishermen in the village, who called on four to five hundred fishermen to expel the managers of the Xingye Fish Farming Cooperative. On the 12th, five to six hundred fishermen went to the county to appeal and took the girl's body to the county court for an autopsy. A criminal prosecution has been filed.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Li Zhun's Sea Patrol Diary (Continued) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>At 11:20 AM, the anchor was dropped, and the anchor chain was almost completely used up. The water there was clear, and in the sunlight, the seabed could be seen. There were many red and white corals, as large as pine and cypress trees. There was a kind of white ribbonfish, about ten feet long, which was intertwined and circled within the coral trees, turning endlessly. After lunch, I led the others to board the shore by sampan. Guoxiang asked me not to sit in a sampan, but to use a larger flat-bottomed boat, so that I could get ashore. I followed his advice. Indeed, I could only reach the shallow beach closest to the shore. Those who took the sampan could not enter. Guoxiang had bought seven or eight of these boats at the harbor. I initially thought they were useless, but now I know they are useful. I still held a wooden stick, left the boat, and stepped over piles of stones to pass. Jumping from this stone to that stone, the distance varied, some were far, some were near, some were high, and some were low. The boat could not move forward, and without this, I could not reach the other shore. I was standing on a large, round stone, wanting to jump again, but the distance was a little far, and I was afraid of falling into the water. I hesitated again and again, and the stone I was standing on moved. I thought it was because of my weight, but the stone had already started to move forward. I was frightened and almost fell. The stone moved closer to the other stone, and then I jumped over. I asked in surprise, "How can the stone move?" Guoxiang and Jingrong said respectfully, "This stone is a giant clam in the sea. Its shell has grown green moss for who knows how many years." I also saw a fish, its color black mixed with red and yellow. Guoxiang said, "This is a small whale, also seven or eight feet long. The tide is receding and it cannot get out, so it is trapped in this shallow water." I poked it with a stick, and water sprayed out of a hole in its head, as high as ten feet. I quickly went ashore and saw many red crabs on the sand, different from other crabs. Their claws were long and numerous, and they moved very fast. When I hit them with a stick, they immediately escaped into a snail shell and disappeared. When I picked up the shell, I saw their claws curled up inside the shell, without any trace. Each crab had a shell, no more than two inches in size. The shell of one crab had been picked up by someone else, so it had nowhere to return, and it curled up on the sand, like a dead thing. I picked up several hundred of them in a bamboo basket to give to friends and relatives, and named them "Hermit Crabs." The workers took shovels ashore and dug in various places and springs, looking for fresh water. After digging more than ten places to a depth of twenty or thirty feet, they could not find any. In fact, it was not an island, but a sandbar.</p>
<p>Westerners also call it "Ailen." This island is no more than six or seven li long, and it takes no more than a few hours to travel around it. There are no large trees on the island. There is a kind of plant that is neither grass nor tree, about ten feet tall and large enough to embrace. The branches and leaves spread out horizontally. Sheltering in this forest is truly a cool world. The sand on the ground is deep black, formed by the accumulation of bird droppings for thousands of years. There are no fierce beasts, insects, or snakes on the island, but there are many birds, mostly gray-black. The large ones raise their heads as tall as a person, with long beaks, and are not afraid of people. When I hit them with a stick, some flew away and some did not. The large ones always fought with people. Instead of defending themselves, they tried to peck at people's eyes. From afar, I saw a large group of birds, about a thousand or more, gathered on the beach. I shot at them three times with a shotgun, but none of them flew away. I thought I had missed, but the guards went to look and found that they had shot down more than thirty birds. The guards chased them away, and they finally flew away, probably because they did not know the power of guns and what humans were. There were many German words carved on the coconut trees and stones, all written in the 1800s. The German, Brown, copied the inscriptions in writing. The stones were not sandstone, but formed by countless coral polyps, so they were named "Coral Stones." Then I came to a place with a stone chamber, eight or nine feet wide, surrounded by coral stones. The top was covered with two extremely large clam shells. I rested here. There was also German carved with knives on the stone, written in 1850. All of them had photos, but I don't know where they were lost after the reform. I ordered the workers to carve words on the coral stone: "[Guangdong Navy Admiral Li Zhun of the Great Qing Dynasty inspected this place in the thirty-third year of Guangxu]." I named it Fubo Island in commemoration of arriving here first on the Fubo. I also ordered the carpenter to make a wooden frame and build a wooden house on the island, covered with coconut palm fronds as walls and paved with coconut palm fronds. A white mast more than five feet high was erected on the side of the house, and the yellow dragon national flag was hung. From then on, this place became Chinese territory. I spent the night on the island. After dusk, I heard a rustling sound in the water. Guoxiang said, "This is a giant sea turtle coming ashore to lay eggs. From now on, we won't have to worry about running out of food." I led the people to each hold an ox-eye lantern, reflecting the light into their chests, and waited on the river. Under the moonlight, I saw large turtles coming up one after another, in countless numbers. We all shone the lights on them, and the turtles immediately retracted their necks and did not move. The sailors inserted wooden sticks under the turtles' bellies and lifted them up with force. They immediately lay on their backs on the sand. There were about twenty of them. Guoxiang said, "That's enough. It's enough food for several hundred of us for three days." Guoxiang also led the sailors to hold bamboo fences and open the accumulated sand under the trees. There were countless turtle eggs, light red in color, round and large like fists. The shell was soft and not hard. We picked up two large baskets. After returning, we scalded them with boiling water, tore open a mouth, and ate them by sucking them. The taste was very good. Guoxiang said, "There are even more bird eggs, but they are not as delicious as turtle eggs." At dawn, I led the people to pick various bird eggs under the trees, of different sizes, some as large as chicken and duck eggs, and some as large as rice bowls, six or seven inches long, all light green in color. The extremely large ones had countless black spots and smelled fishy when cut open. The shell of this extremely large egg was like an ostrich egg, as hard as stone and could not be broken at all. Later, I took it to the provincial capital and asked the ivory carver in Daxin Street to open a skylight and engrave landscapes and figures on it, making it a display item. The giant turtle lying on its back was about ten feet long and six or seven feet wide. The sailors and workers used knives and axes to remove the shell and butcher the meat, and each received a share. The meat was as red as beef, and the skirt was two inches thick. Each turtle yielded twenty or thirty catties, and the total weight was four or five hundred catties. Eight pairs were left, and they were not allowed to be butchered. They were lifted onto the sampan or boat alive and transported to the ship, where they were lifted by a crane. The eight turtles had filled the space in front of the official cabin, so the sailors and workers had no place to rest and eat. So they sat around the turtles' bellies to eat and played cards there. At night, I felt sorry for them lying on their backs and ordered people to turn them over. In the dead of night, the turtles chirped like ducks, making extremely loud noises, causing the people to not be able to sleep. I still ordered the sailors to turn them over on their backs, and they were silent. In the afternoon, I led the people back to the ship, leaving several head of livestock, goats, and water buffalo, male and female, on the island. Brown wept at them, saying, "Alas, these cattle and sheep will die of thirst because there is no fresh water." At noon, we set sail, and after about thirty li, we arrived at another place, with islands on both sides. There was sand on the seabed, where we could anchor, unlike Fubo Island, which was full of coral stones and difficult to anchor. There was sand on the shore, and sampans and boats could all land. Then I led the people to shore. The forests, trees, birds, and everything else were the same as on the previous island. The worker who was digging the well came back after a while and reported that he had found fresh water, and it tasted very good. Digging was only a little over ten feet deep. I tasted it, and it was indeed very sweet. We named it Gan Quan Island and erected a stone monument and raised a flag to commemorate it. This island is about ten or more li long and six or seven li wide. I walked for two or three hours and still could not go around it in a week. On the beach, I picked up something that looked like a golden melon, as large as a tangerine, its color blue-purple. The divisions were interspersed with pearl-white dots, like stone but not stone, light in texture and hollow. There was a stem on top, like a poppy seed capsule, and a hole at the bottom, very beautiful. I don't know what it was. Jingrong said, "This is both animal and plant. If there is a living one, we should find it and show it to the military governor." There were also various other strange and wonderful things that had not been seen in the mainland. There was a stone cup that held cold water without leaking and dried easily. When hot water was put in it, it smelled fishy. It felt like it was made of stone when touched, but its texture was soft. Something that was originally round could be made square or elliptical. Red and white coral were everywhere. The red ones were more than an inch large, but their texture was rough and had few patterns. There were even more white ones. I once picked up a large one, with hundreds of them clustered together, like a mountain shape. I put it in a bauxite box and displayed it in the Jiangnan Industrial Exhibition along with stone gourds and stone tablets. After viewing this island, I also released livestock on it. Then we passed to the island on the other side, which was smaller than Gan Quan Island, no more than eight li long and wide. There was even more coral than before, so we named it Coral Island and erected a stone monument and raised a flag to commemorate it. In the afternoon, we returned to the ship and set sail. After about twenty nautical miles, we arrived at another island. After anchoring, we went ashore by sampan. There was a lot of seaweed in the sea, of unknown length, with small white flowers. The sampan's oars were also blocked by it and could not move forward. We saw a stone with something round like a golden melon on it, with purple flowers blooming on the stem, like butterflies. I said, "This must be the living stone melon that I picked up on the shore yesterday." We anchored the boat close to it, and I personally touched its root, which was about four or five inches long, and seemed to be stony and growing on the stone. I pulled it hard to get it down, and the root broke. White pulp flowed out from under the root, and its smell was very strange, like the meat of crab claws. The flower was very hard and also looked like stone, but it was incomparably bright. I don't know if it was animal or plant. I picked it up and took it back. After a few days, the flowers withered and the pulp inside the shell flowed out, leaving an empty shell, which was presented to Marshal An along with the melon that I picked up earlier and sent to the Jiangnan Industrial Exhibition. After landing and inspecting for a week, the situation was the same as on the other islands. We named it Chenhang Island, erected a stone monument, and raised a flag. We returned to the ship and anchored there that night. On the third day, at dawn, we set sail again. After about ten nautical miles, we arrived at an island. After landing, we saw a fishing boat there, taking hawksbill turtles and raising them in shallow water by the sea, surrounding them with small branches stuck in the water, so they could not leave. I asked the fisherman where he was from.</p>
<p>The fisherman said that he was from Wenchang Lingshui County and came here every year, taking advantage of the clear weather and good wind to come here to take hawksbill turtles, sea cucumbers, and kelp to sell. I asked him how much fresh water and food his boat could hold, and how he dared to take this risk. The fisherman said, "There are only four or five of us. The food is limited, and we can't bring much water. We eat turtle meat, turtle eggs, bird eggs, bird meat, fish, shrimp, and the like. To drink, there are many coconut trees on this island, so we won't die of thirst." I told him that there was an island with fresh water ahead, and if he went there, he wouldn't have to worry about not having fresh water. I looked inside his boat and saw a cabin of large black sea cucumbers and thorn sea cucumbers marinated with lime, all very small. I asked him why he didn't marinate the large black sea cucumbers by the sea, which were more than ten feet long. The fisherman said that the mainland didn't want such large ones. He led me to see the shallow water by the sea, where there was a large black sea cucumber, more than ten feet long, the color of a dead pig. I poked it with a stick, and its meat was like a soft tumor, shedding a piece. Although the skin was very black, the meat was extremely white, but there was no blood. It didn't move much. I thought it was dead. A worker hoeed it with a cross-shaped hoe, shedding another large piece, and the sea cucumber moved forward slightly. It was truly a cold-blooded animal. The situation on the island was the same as on the other islands. After touring around, we named it Linshui Island, erected a stone monument, and raised a clan flag, and went to other islands. All of them were named and had stone monuments erected. One was named Huo Qiu Island, because my sister, Qian Pei, the wife of Grand Prefect Dai Yun, was from Huo Qiu. One was named Gui An Island, because Ding Shao Sun was a native of Gui An. One was named Wucheng Island, because Grand Magistrate Shen Jiwen was from Wucheng. One was named Ningbo Island, because Investigator Li Zichuan was from Ningbo. One was named Xinhui Island, because Sub-Commander Lin Ruijia Guoxiang was from Xinhui. One was named Huayang Island, because Wang Shuwu was from Huayang. One was named Yanghu Island, because Grand Magistrate Liu Ziyi was from Yanghu. One was named Xiuning Island, because Patrol Officer Wu Gaichen Jingrong was from Xiuning. One was named Panyu Island, because Grand Magistrate Wang Zhe Yuan was from Panyu. There was also an island that was further away, about sixty nautical miles, which was twenty or thirty li long. It was formerly named Lincoln, but we renamed it Fengrun Island, in honor of Marshal An, who presided over the great events. Because the sky was changing, we didn't dare to linger any longer, fearing that we would run out of coal and water and not be able to return if the wind rose. On April 23, we sailed away, and after forty-eight hours, we arrived in Hong Kong. The next day, we returned to the province. The trip had taken almost a month. I recounted the whole experience to Marshal An, who was overjoyed and thought that our nautical chart would now include these fourteen Xisha Islands. The strange and wonderful things that we had picked up were displayed in the hall, and colleagues and gentry came to inquire. I was exhausted from explaining and pointing. The islands that we had visited were all drawn into maps by naval surveyors and presented to the Ministry of the Navy and the Army and the Grand Council for record. This expedition, with a very old ship that could not travel more than ten nautical miles and the lives of hundreds of people, was entrusted to Lin Ruijia. It was truly a blessing from heaven, and could not have been achieved solely by human effort. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Two Ways of Arranging Payment of Debts <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Kyoto-Shanghai Railway to Pay 270,000 Yuan First</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Discount and Pay 25,000 Pounds</p>
<p>Recently, Western newspapers have repeatedly discussed the overdue principal and interest on the debts of the Kyoto-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Ningbo Railways, especially concerning the Kyoto-Shanghai Railway. However, the railway bureau has not made any statements. According to what was heard yesterday, the bureau has already arranged to pay two batches of principal and interest, which shows that the bureau is earnestly working to reduce its debts and not just giving empty words to evade responsibility. The details of the repayment are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Kyoto-Shanghai Railway has a huge amount of accumulated debt, such as the remaining interest from the 18th to 20th years, the advance payment for purchasing vehicles on behalf of the Sino-British Company, the principal of the maturing loans from the 19th to 22nd years, and the interest on the recent three loans, all of which need to be cleared. Those who pay attention to the affairs of this railway should already know this. Among these overdue payments, one installment of the advance payment for purchasing vehicles, totaling 9,000 British pounds, was repaid within March of this year. The remaining items have not been paid due to a shortage of funds. Now, with active reorganization, 270,000 yuan have been accumulated. It has been decided to allocate all of it to pay off the remaining interest from the 18th year, which is the most overdue. The total amount of this remaining interest is 398,839.20 yuan. After this payment of 270,000 yuan, there will still be 16,839.20 yuan outstanding. It is said that it can also be fully repaid in two months.</p>
<p>The economic situation of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is slightly better than that of the Kyoto-Shanghai Railway. However, since the Shanghai war last year, the principal of the loan due in May of last year has not been paid on schedule. It has been overdue for several periods, each period being 37,500 pounds. The railway bureau has withdrawn about 200,000 yuan from the special reserve fund of the railway and raised the same amount from the operating cash, totaling 400,000 yuan, which is converted into 25,000 British pounds, and handed over to HSBC to be used as part of the repayment of the principal of the loan due in May of last year. It is said that the remainder will be gradually cleared when a sufficient amount has been accumulated.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Tax Revenue in This City Has Improved <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shortfall Has Been Planned as a Whole</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the city's finances have been greatly affected. It is reported that the municipal finance authorities are actively reorganizing tax revenue, which has improved. The income for the 21st year is estimated to be more than 8.7 million yuan, an increase of more than 1 million yuan compared to the previous year. Although expenditures have increased due to the establishment of new agencies and the expansion of business for municipal facilities and public security, austerity is still emphasized in the rapid advancement. The total expenditure for the year is about 9.7 million yuan, an increase of only more than 500,000 yuan compared to the previous year. It is reported that the municipal authorities are planning as a whole to deal with the shortfall between income and expenditure. The comparative figures of income and expenditure are listed below:</p>
<p>21st Year　　　　　　　　20th Year　　　　　　　　Comparison</p>
<p>Income: 8,789,984 yuan　7,737,284 yuan　1,052,700 yuan</p>

<p>Lin Wo-jiang Will Go to Hangzhou Again in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>To Inspect the Assembly of the Previous Batch of Five Aircraft</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association ordered 18 Hawk fighter planes from the United States. In addition to the six planes that have been shipped in two batches, there are still 12 planes, which are being shipped one after another. According to Mr. Lin Wo-jiang, secretary of the association, he recently received a notice from the Central Bank that nine planes arrived this morning (that is, yesterday morning). The bank will send personnel to go to customs to declare and pick up the goods, and transport them to the aircraft factory of the Hangzhou Aviation School for assembly. However, the date of transportation still needs to be inquired with the Central Bank. As for the five aircraft previously transported, which have been named Shanghai Merchant, etc., they are still being assembled. However, the engines still need to be tested. It will take about 25 days to complete the work. Therefore, the date of the naming ceremony can only be determined at that time. He also plans to go to Hangzhou again in the next day or two to inspect the assembly of the previous batch of five aircraft. The nine aircraft that arrived this time will be named separately at a later date because assembly takes time.</p>

<h3 id="e104">American Cotton Resold to Japanese Merchants <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Tomen Co., Ltd. Has Purchased 4,000 Bales</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after Finance Minister Song Ziwen established a US$50 million cotton and wheat loan in the United States, the news came that the cotton merchants in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, were paying attention to how the American cotton would be sold after it arrived in China. A few days ago, it was rumored that the first batch of American cotton, which was already on its way to China, had been sold by the managers of foreign firms such as Fuga, Anli, and Meian Sanyo. However, these foreign firms immediately formally denied this. The Chinese merchants, however, have long felt unable to bear the suffering of losses due to poor business conditions and have no ability to purchase, which is a fact. The reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency, after running around for several days and conducting investigations in various ways, learned that the exact number of the first batch of American cotton arriving in China was 58,000 bales, which were entrusted by the Chinese government to be sold by British and American merchants in Shanghai. Therefore, the rumor that it was purchased by Japanese merchants has now become a fact, that is, Tomen Co., Ltd. purchased 4,000 bales (Japanese weight) from the first batch of 58,000 bales of American cotton imported. The Japanese merchants concerned not only did not deny this news, but also said that the sales contract has been signed. Tomen Co., Ltd. attaches great importance to the purchase of this cotton because it has various political relations. Because of the deterioration of Anglo-Japanese relations and the resistance to Indian cotton, Japan's purchase of American cotton from our authorities is inevitable. It is also reported that the Chinese merchants held an emergency meeting a few days ago, advocating that half of the second batch of imported cotton should be sold by Chinese merchants. The total amount of Picimi cotton imported is as high as 4 million bales, of which 2.31 million bales are planned to be transported and sold to the interior. However, judging from the economic situation in the interior, it is feared that it is impossible, and it will eventually be resold to foreign merchants.</p>

<p>Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, believes that recently, Chinese people in various ports have often been treated harshly by the local governments.

<h3 id="e107">Representatives of the Petition Group for Relief from Communist Disaster in Northwest Sichuan Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>First Go to the Municipal Government to Request Relief</p>
<p>Will Visit Shanghai's Philanthropists</p>
<p>Recently, the generals in Sichuan have been fighting fiercely, and the Communist bandits have taken the opportunity to sneak into Sichuan, and the situation is very rampant. The people of the province have organized a petition group for relief from the Communist disaster in Northwest Sichuan to request rescue from various places. The group arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning, Qiu Zhizhong and Li Qingfan from the Sichuan Shanghai Association accompanied the members of the petition group, Liu Zizhong, He Baoheng, Li Shenpei, and others, to the municipal government to request relief.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Spread of the Communist Disaster in Sichuan Province <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to members of the petition group for relief from the Communist disaster in Western Sichuan, the generals in Sichuan often engage in infighting, and there are years of war, which makes people unable to live. The Communist bandits who were suppressed in Hubei the year before last sneaked into Shaanxi and then into Sichuan. Now, the three counties of Tongjiang, Najiang, and Bazhong have been occupied by the Communist bandits, and there is a trend of spreading. Since the Communist bandits sneaked in, the refugees in the area have fled everywhere, and more than 2 million people have been displaced. If no relief is provided, they will inevitably take risks, and the future of Sichuan Province is even more unimaginable. The Communist disaster in Sichuan Province may be even worse than that in Jiangxi today. Although we are weak, we cannot sit idly by and watch the spread of the Communist disaster. Therefore, we have organized a petition group to request relief from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Once Went to Jiangxi to See Chiang <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The group member also said that stabilizing Sichuan Province should be divided into two types: fundamental and symptomatic. The so-called fundamental cure is to stop the civil war in Sichuan immediately. Therefore, the group has gone to Jiangxi to ask to see Chairman Chiang to send senior officials to coordinate the defense affairs of the various Sichuan generals and to work together to build Sichuan Province. In terms of symptomatic treatment, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate money to save this large number of refugees. There are many philanthropists in Shanghai, so it is planned to ask Mayor Wu to call on all walks of life to pay attention and assist with huge sums of money so that these refugees can receive this assistance and not be forced to take risks.</p>

<p>After the group arrived at the municipal government, the mayor was out on official business, and Secretary Guo Yao received them. Secretary Guo expressed his deep sympathy for the points made by the group and promised to report to the mayor on their behalf and introduce them to Shanghai's philanthropists and charitable organizations for relief. Therefore, the group also requested relief from Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Shiying, Wang Xiaolai, and others.</p>
<p>For the Matter of Investigating Donations</p>
<h3 id="e111">Zhu Qinglan Telegraphed the National Government Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Please Send Senior Officials to Thoroughly Audit and Announce the Results</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and other organizations have had many misunderstandings due to the records of donations received by various newspapers. In order to clarify the truth, it is planned to telegraph the government in the next few days to send senior officials to thoroughly investigate the accounts. General Zhu Qinglan, because he personally forwarded many of the donations received by the associations, telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, saying: "Qinglan, entrusted by the people and under the supervision and assistance of the government, followed the comrades to handle the Northeast relief affairs. First, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association was established. Later, the donations received by various organizations in Shanghai were also handed over to Qinglan for forwarding. In August of last year, I went to Ping to promote work affairs. Everything that has passed is in the clear view of the public. The various organizations have execution, audit, and custody for the receipt and expenditure of funds. The organizations are not exactly the same, but they are all meticulous. The methods of announcement include publishing in Shanghai newspapers and printing and distributing report books to general donors. I believe that I have always been cautious in handling this matter. Recently, several newspapers in Shanghai have suddenly attacked arbitrarily, with rumors filling the pages. Qinglan's conscience believes that there is nothing else, but the city is full of rumors, and cups and snakes cast shadows. If we do not take the opportunity to dissect and clarify, the black and white will be indistinguishable, and right and wrong will be unclear. The impact on Qinglan's personal reputation is small, and the impact on the future of the national salvation cause is great. In addition to the public organizations that Qinglan participates in and donates funds to, which will publish the donation expenditures in the newspaper, I especially telegraph to request the special dispatch of impartial senior officials to thoroughly audit and announce the results to show great credibility. I await instructions."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Telegraph to the Central Government <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Party Central Committee, the National Government Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Control Yuan are hereby informed that since the September 18th Incident, the people of the Northeast have been living in fear of national subjugation and have risen up to defend the country's territory. The righteous armies in various places have sprung up to resist the stubborn enemy in the north, and their will is firm. The righteous armies are commendable, and the people at home and abroad, in accordance with the principle of collective wisdom and strength, have enthusiastically contributed to the righteous cause, and there have been donations to support the righteous armies. Unexpectedly, at a time when the four provinces have been lost and the treaty has been signed under the city, there are people who are suspected of encroaching on and stealing donations from the public. What is more important than social credit, political prosperity, and the future of the nation? It is reported that the total amount of donations from various ports at home and abroad to support the Northeast righteous armies should not be less than 20 to 30 million yuan. According to the accounts recently announced by Ma Zhanshan, the main force of the Northeast righteous armies, only more than 1.7 million yuan has been received before and after. Moreover, according to another message, Guangzhou alone had remitted Ma only 73,700 yuan at that time. Taken together, the difference from the total amount of donations is more than 90%! The righteous armies shed blood at the national gate, which was the lifeline of the country at that time. Now, those who encroach on and steal donations are no different from criminals who destroy the country! The affiliated associations are all legitimate public groups, and they have the responsibility to investigate the funds donated by the public. Therefore, a joint committee has been jointly organized to engage in investigation matters. Although the investigation by public groups is only enough to express social indignation, social sanctions have not yet exerted the authority of national discipline and national law. Moreover, since they all belong to public groups, their powers are limited, and the effect is also limited. The way to remedy this is to rely on the country to exert its absolute authority and carry out judicial investigation, in addition to implementing social sanctions. Alas, the world is changing rapidly, and the national crisis has not ended. Strengthening national strength, defending oneself, and seeking survival depend on the collective wisdom and strength of the people. If even this lifeline of contributing to the righteous cause is cut off, then the destruction of social trust is also self-destruction of the nation's survival. If this is not investigated, and if the investigation is not thorough, can this nation that forgets the public for the sake of private gain still survive in this world? Therefore, we urge your office (departments) to order the Ministry of Judicial Administration to forward the order to the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Special Zone Court to conduct a thorough investigation as soon as possible in accordance with the meaning of the national prosecution. If there is no wrongdoing found, those who are public-minded, righteous, and self-respecting will be even more prominent. If there is wrongdoing found, those who are selfish and unlawful must be brought to justice and not allowed to escape, so that they can be warned and shown to the future. The prestige of the country and the future of the nation are truly dependent on this. We make this urgent plea and ask for your consideration.</p>

Approved for filing. Please conduct a thorough investigation and release the public's doubts. The case is stored and approved."</p>

<p>Encountered Wind and Pirates, Engine Damaged by Water</p>
<p>Run Aground and Left Shoal Six Times</p>
<p>The Tong Fu merchant ship of the Tongan Company on Fuzhou Road in Shanghai encountered a sudden wind during its voyage from Pukou to Guangdong to transport coal. The engine was damaged, and the cabins were flooded, causing a major danger. It ran aground on the Wenzhou Ocean six times in a row. Now the ship's body is half-submerged in the Ou Sea. Shanghai has sent personnel to transport rescue pumpers to assist in the rescue. The details are divided and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Encountered Wind at Dongting Lighthouse <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Tongan Company's Tong Fu ship, with a deadweight of 2,500 tons, loaded 3,300 tons of Zhongxing coal from Pukou on the 25th of last month to be delivered to Guangzhou. On the evening of the 26th, the ship passed Wusong. At 10:45 a.m. on the 27th, the ship arrived in Wenzhou waters and suddenly encountered a hurricane blowing from Hong Kong. Seeing that the situation was critical, the Tong Fu ship wanted to take shelter at the Dongting Lighthouse. However, the hurricane had already reached the stern. The Tong Fu's cabin was hit by huge wind and waves, causing damage to the engine in the engine room. It immediately chose a place to drop anchor and repair the engine. It took five hours before it could start sailing again.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Water Entered Near Bijia Mountain <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>It sailed out that night. At 5:45 a.m. on the 28th, water suddenly flooded into the engine room. The first mate flew to inform the captain. After testing for a long time, he could not find the source of the water entering the ship. The crew was very frightened and immediately used pumps to pump water. However, more water came in than was pumped out. At this point, the first mate asked the captain to quickly find an anchoring point to avoid accidents. At 9:40 a.m., he opened to Bijia Mountain, close to Pikishan, and dropped anchor and stopped sailing. Everyone was mobilized to repair the engine and worked hard to drain the water. However, the water in the ship was coming in very quickly, which was extremely dangerous at this time. The ship's body had a tendency to sink.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wind阻海盜行劫 <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Tong Fu ship originally had a radio, which was managed by radio operator Huang Zhonghao. This time, Huang suddenly left the ship and went ashore to resign to the company. The radio had been damaged and could not generate electricity, so after encountering the danger, it was unable to communicate with Shanghai for help at sea. It was delayed until 6:40 a.m. on the 29th before the captain changed direction and decided to sail to Wenzhou to avoid the danger of sinking. Just as he was about to raise the anchor and sail, at 12:40 p.m., a group of pirates suddenly arrived in a bandit ship to rob the Tong Fu, which had approached the outer block. The crew thought that this time they would be robbed by thieves and it would be difficult to escape. Unexpectedly, the sea was full of wind and waves, and the pirate ship was hit by the hurricane and could not get close to the Tong Fu. The shipowner [depending on the Secretary-General] took the opportunity to raise the anchor and fly away, and finally escaped. The ship arrived at Wenzhou Outer Port in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Ran Aground on Baishi Island <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>On the 30th, the water in the ship was still about six feet deep. The engine room was pumped first. At 3 p.m., the first mate said that it could be guaranteed to be safe, and then set off for Guangdong. It sailed for about three hours, and the water entering the engine room increased even more, exceeding six feet. The ship could hardly move, so it had to return to Wenzhou. At 9:50 p.m., when it arrived at White Rock outside Wenzhou, the ship ran aground. After an hour, it tried its best to knock down the car and retreat, and drove to Tiaolinggang to drop anchor. On the morning of the 31st, after being taken out of the water by a Jiangshang ship, Tong Fu ran aground again for the second time at 1:10 p.m. After various methods, it barely escaped the shoal at 3:10 p.m. and went to Wenzhou Zhonggang to wait for the tide.</p>

<p>On August 1st, after the tide rose and the ship set sail, it ran aground for the third time just a few minutes later. It took another three hours to free it from the dangerous shoal. At 5 o'clock, it reached the waters off Laomiao but ran aground for the fourth time. The engine room was flooded with seawater, causing the ship to sink deeper and become unable to navigate. The Tongfu’s voyage to Wenzhou was a risky one, undertaken to prevent sinking. On the 2nd, at 10 o'clock, the ship used a 105-fathom-long cable to anchor in the deep water, waiting for the Ouhai Customs official, Han Lingjiang, to arrive and guide the ship. At 12 o'clock, it sailed at full speed, but unexpectedly ran aground again. It wasn't until 6:30 PM on the 3rd that the ship was finally freed from the shoal using maximum speed, but it had already been stranded for twenty-five hours. Finally, at 7:10 AM on the 4th, it entered Wenzhou Port, passed the first sandbar, and reached the Customs pier, where it anchored and urgently reported to the company, requesting assistance.</p>

<p>The shipowner, relying on Slynsky, came to Shanghai because the ship's radio was damaged, and the engine room of the Tongfu ship was flooded, the source of the water unknown. Moreover, the bottom of the ship had suffered significant damage from running aground six times. The first priority was to pump out the water from the engine room, otherwise there was a risk of sinking. Therefore, he personally came to Shanghai to report to the company. The company's manager, Mr. Bao Anfu, personally went to Wenzhou to inspect. The result was that the Tongfu ship needed urgent rescue, otherwise the Oujiang sandbars were too numerous and the water shallow and dangerous, and an accident might occur, endangering the entire ship. So he immediately returned to Shanghai and dispatched a large number of technicians to Wenzhou to assist in the rescue.</p>

<p>The Tongfu ship's engine room was flooded, making it impossible to pump out the water. After Bao Anfu returned to Shanghai, he urgently rented a powerful rescue pump from Jardine Matheson, at a daily rental of 160 yuan. He also sent two specialized technicians and a group of workers, who have already taken the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan ship to Wenzhou to use the pump to drain the water, so that the Tongfu ship can float to the surface. This time, the Tongfu ship first encountered a hurricane, then pirates, then the engine room flooded, and then it ran aground six times in a row. It is truly fortunate that it did not sink or get lost, but the various losses are very large.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Evolution of Additional Grain Tax in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to a certain gentleman yesterday, the case of adding two yuan per stone to the winter grain tax in Jiangsu Province originated in the Sun Chuanfang era and was called "borrowed grain," with the expectation of repayment. It was collected for another year in the 17th year and renamed the "Northern Expedition Donation," with the intention of abolishing it after the success of the Northern Expedition. Therefore, it was suspended for one year in the 18th year. Unexpectedly, in the 19th year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to continue the collection indefinitely. Due to local opposition, it was changed to one year at a time, and it was no longer continued. In the 20th and 21st years, the provincial government again persuaded the Ministry of Finance and obtained approval to continue the collection. However, the Ministry of Finance ultimately disagreed. Now, Chairman Gu is again discussing with the Ministry of Finance to extend the collection period, but no decision has been made. It has been found that the tax burden of our province is the heaviest in the country. At this time of rural decline and economic hardship, if this additional and harsh levy is not stopped, the bankruptcy of farmers will endanger the foundation of the country, which is truly worrying.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Deep Disappointment of the Frozen Fish Merchants Regarding the Fisheries Bureau's Handling of Ocean Protection <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Optimism Uncertain About Future Construction Funds</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry began collecting fisheries construction fees, various fresh and salted fish merchants have risen up in opposition. Although Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting have repeatedly mediated, some of the fish merchants are still unwilling to comply. Among them, only the frozen fish merchants have been paying the construction fees as required for the past four months without objection, due to the ocean protection. Recently, due to the sinking of the Fuhai patrol ship and the withdrawal of the Qing'an, only the old ship Haiying is available, and it has not been repaired. Moreover, the Haihong and Haigu ships cannot sail to the distant seas. The Fisheries Bureau has no active remedial measures for this. Furthermore, there are more pirates this year, in addition to the Taiwanese bandits, there are also hundreds of Zhu Songzhou's troops scattered around Xiaoyangshan, all fully armed, causing even more harm. The various frozen fish merchants are deeply disappointed with the Fisheries Bureau's handling of ocean protection. The bureau often touts active construction, but even this minimum level of ocean protection cannot meet the merchants' demands, let alone anything else. Therefore, they have recently gathered to discuss joining the opposition, so the future of the construction fees is still uncertain.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Rebuttal by the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, etc., Regarding Pan Xulun's Opinion on Partnership Liability <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Based on Commercial Practices, Supporting Evidence from Laws of Various Countries</p>
<p>The Provision for Joint and Several Liability Should Be Abolished Immediately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Six Trade Associations sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce rebutting accountant Pan Xulun's opinion on partnership liability. The original letter stated: "We respectfully submit that after reading the reports on the 25th and 26th of July, Accountant Pan Xulun's opinion on partnership liability, regarding the partnership itself, cited four malpractices and three difficulties regarding legal provisions, and finally ended with three reasons. In summary, [he opposes changing partnership liability to be shared according to shares, and advocates adding provisions for unlimited liability companies with shared responsibility in the Company Law]. Our associations, etc., consider this a matter of vital interest and dare not agree. Therefore, we do not fear being tedious and will re-examine the established rules and seek new examples, and slightly correct Mr. Pan's opinion. Please consider it accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Legal Action <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>(1) Accountant Pan Xulun opposes changing partnership liability to be shared according to shares, and the first reason is that "[the partnership organization is legally only a contractual relationship between partners internally, and has no independent name or legal personality externally, so it cannot be the subject of litigation...]". According to the meaning of partnership, it refers to a contract where two or more people invest to operate a common business. The partnership stipulated in the Civil Code originally belongs to a contractual act. Except for undisclosed partnerships, the establishment of any partnership contract, even if it cannot be said to belong entirely to commercial acts, ordinary operations of common businesses are mostly commercial. It can always be considered a commercial act. Since it belongs to a commercial act, the registration of the trade name and the registration of the business, even if judged from the original intent of our country's legislation, cannot be said to have no independent name or legal personality. Since the partnership organization is a legal organization in accordance with civil law regulations, its partnership contract is also one of the legal acts. If litigation occurs, it can of course be recognized as the subject of rights and obligations in law. The judgment in the third year, Upper Character No. 40, states, "[...]In ordinary partnerships, all general partners are the subject of rights and obligations". From this, it is clear that the reasons relied upon by Accountant Pan Xulun are not legal or reasonable.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Business Registration <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>(2) Accountant Pan Xulun opposes changing partnership liability to be shared according to shares, and the second reason is that "[the establishment of a partnership has no obligation to apply for registration with the competent authority, and there is no basis for partnership bankruptcy...]". This second reason follows the fallacies of the first reason mentioned above, still believing that because there is no registration or registration, the disadvantage lies in the difficulty for creditors to investigate. Regarding this point, it has long been stipulated in the current merchant precedents, and if it can be strictly implemented, there will be no way to keep it secret. Judging from the current facts, your association has already clearly stipulated regulations for business registration and submitted them to the competent authority for implementation, so there is no need to worry about it.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Unlimited Liability Company <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>(3) Accountant Pan Xulun advocates adding provisions for unlimited liability companies with shared responsibility in the Company Law, and his opinion is that "[...]But because a partnership contract cannot have legal personality, only a company has this qualification, so the organization of shared unlimited liability should be stipulated in the Company Law...]". It must be known that in civilized legal systems, business is free and there are no restrictions on the qualifications of merchants. The partnership contract stipulated in our country's Civil Code is based on liberalism as the norm. Therefore, anyone who has the ability to enter into a contract and independently bear obligations can be a merchant and engage in commerce. This is the principle adopted in legislation, which is very suitable for the national conditions of our country. A company must follow a certain system. It is not enough to simply have two or more people partnering to operate a business to be recklessly called a company. If the requirements stipulated in the Company Law are not followed, such as the fixed number of people, the signing of articles of association in writing, and registration with the government, then the benefits protected by the Company Law cannot be obtained. This is a kind of absolute mandatory principle. In the last two or three decades, the organization of shops in our country, new-style joint ventures in major trading ports, have sometimes adopted the company system, while the rest are partnership organizations. The history is very long and the customs have become widespread. In order to implement the proposal to stipulate the organization of shared unlimited liability in the Company Law, Accountant Pan Xulun does not hesitate to forcibly associate partnership business with company organization and discuss them as one. He directly wants to turn this free commercial example into a purely mandatory regulation, which is like cutting one's feet to fit the shoes, not in line with custom, not suitable for national conditions. In terms of legal principles, it is a misunderstanding. In terms of malpractices, it is truly enough to disrupt the original stability of society.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Laws of Various Countries <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>(4) Accountant Pan Xulun, regarding our associations' request to amend Article 681 of the Civil Code, which stipulates joint and several liability for partnership debts, to be shared according to shares, raised three difficulties. The most important of these is that "[In all countries of the world, all partners are jointly and severally liable, and our country's legal system should not be unique]". Accountant Pan Xulun made this affirmative statement, but it is not known what basis he has. Except for the United Kingdom and the United States, which have no codified laws that can be used as reference, please cite the explicit legal provisions regarding partnership debts in the laws of France, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany and translate them below as rebuttal evidence: 1. Article 1862 of the French Civil Code: "In partnerships not established for commercial purposes, the partners are not jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the partnership. One partner may not make his other partners assume his obligations, except when there are special provisions for the other partners to jointly and severally assume the obligations of one person." 2. Article 675 of the Japanese Civil Code: "If the creditor of the partnership does not know the standard for loss sharing among the partners at the time the debt arises, he may exercise his rights against each partner in an equal portion (i.e., the average portion)." 3. Article 977 of the entire Swiss Civil Code: "There are no regulations regarding responsibility for partnership contracts." (Note: According to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of its Civil Code, regarding legal issues, verbally or interpretively, judicial officials can even base their judgments or applications on established academic theories and precedents of judgments.) 4. Article 725 of the German Civil Code: "When the partnership property is insufficient to pay off common debts and repay shares, the partners shall supplement the insufficient amount according to the pro rata share of loss distribution." Judging from the above examples of legal provisions in various national civil codes, the affirmative statement of Accountant Pan Xulun that "[In all countries of the world, all partners are jointly and severally liable]", it is worth considering whether there is a legal basis for the argument [against changing partnership liability to be shared according to shares]. Furthermore, when a country enacts laws, if it is not based on its own inherent customs, it must be based on the codified laws or precedents of its advanced countries to stipulate regulations and make them legal codes to bind the people. Now, let us first talk about the purpose of legislation in our country. The Civil Code promulgated in our country, at the time of its legislation, apart from the United Kingdom and the United States, which had no codified laws that could be used as reference and were completely incompatible with our country's national conditions and commercial customs, was mostly based on European countries with codified laws and referred to our country's historical customs before starting to compile. All three laws of the General Provisions, Obligations, and Property Rights of the Civil Code either took the law from Germany or even took the legislative examples of the Swiss and Japanese Civil Codes. Based on this, exploring the legislative intent of our country's Civil Code, it is not difficult to see everything, and the legislative system can be found. Secondly, let us talk about the customs of partnership business in our country. The organizational regulations of partnership business in our country must first mutually agree on a list (i.e., a contract). The common rules stipulated on the list, regardless of whether they are for the whole country or any region, are generally recognized. Profits are shared equally according to shares, and losses are shared according to shares. They have been passed down for thousands of years and have long become a common practice in the business world. Accountant Pan Xulun is also concerned about business people, so he should have a deep understanding of this inherent custom. Observing the above-mentioned civil law examples of France, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany, as well as the legislative intent of our country at that time and the inherent customs of the country, considering Article 681 of the Civil Code, which stipulates that partners are jointly and severally liable for partnership debts, is it not completely contrary? If, as Accountant Pan Xulun said, "[Our country's legal system should not be unique]", then for the amendment of this legal example, we should all express sympathy and work together to promote it. Why hold a dissenting opinion and openly oppose it? Our associations, etc., are truly filled with regret.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Legislative Spirit <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>(5) Accountant Pan Xulun cited four malpractices, one being, "[Wouldn't the protection of creditors be completely lost?]", another being, "[The harm to creditors is immeasurable]", a third being, "[The creditor's side is almost without any protection]", and a fourth being, "[It is tantamount to losing most of the existing guarantees originally set for each creditor]". Looking at the entire text, it is everywhere thinking for the creditors, without mentioning a single word about the debtors. It must be known that debtors are often in the position of economically weak parties. If the law is always based on protecting creditors, wouldn't the legislative spirit be completely lost? The introduction to the Obligations section of the Civil Code says, "[Our country's current legislation is based on the public interest of the entire society and is always based on seeking public happiness. This is the way of the king, and the spirit of benevolence, forgiveness, and fairness should permeate the entire Civil Code, protecting the weak everywhere]". It also says, "The Obligations section of the Civil Code was originally called the Creditor's section, but now it has been changed to the Obligations section because the word creditor, from the perspective of the name, seems to imply that that law is specifically to protect creditors. Specifically protecting creditors is the way of the hegemon". Based on this, Accountant Pan Xulun's view of actively protecting creditors cannot but be regarded as a subjective error. Based on this subjective view, the so-called malpractices, so-called difficulties, and so-called reasons are all inconsistent with objective facts and go without saying.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Violation of Contract <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>In summary, the civil laws of various countries mentioned above, which served as the basic laws when our country formulated the Civil Code, have no provisions for partners being jointly and severally liable. Originally, partnership behavior is contractual behavior, so regardless of whether it is commercial or non-commercial, regarding losses, it must be shared according to the contract agreed upon by each partner. This is the greatest principle of the Civil Code's contract law regulations and must not be equated with the unlimited liability shareholders stipulated in the Company Law, who also bear this unlimited liability. The list of agreements drawn up by our country's partnership organization is the contract. Since the contract has provisions, profits and losses are shared according to shares, but the legal articles in the partnership section of the Civil Code make joint and several liability, which cannot but be regarded as a violation of the contract. Persistently adhering to this article that violates the contract and wanting the people to obey it, what about commercial bankruptcy? The examples and arguments advocating that joint and several liability cannot be canceled show that the provisions of this legal article completely lose their footing in legislation. It seems to be extremely clear. For this reason, we do not hesitate to use further broad citations to dispel private opinions. We earnestly request your association to truthfully submit this to the central administrative and legislative courts, in accordance with the codified laws of various advanced countries, as well as the prior customs that have been passed down in our country, and based on the principle of freely stipulating contract regulations, quickly amend Article 681 of the Civil Code, or even abolish it or order it to cease being used. We will listen to your wise decision. This is truly both virtuous and fair. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Trade Association, August 14th.</p>

<p>Ordered to Submit Rebuttal Evidence to the Party Department for Verification</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that Shen Xianlu, manager of the Hengchang Fish Shop in Xiaodongmen, and Zheng Jin'ao, a salesman, were previously discovered by the Fish Industry Inspection and Anti-Counterfeit Committee to have partnered in selling poisonous dried Dongkou flatfish. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce was notified and instructed the Fuyuan Money Shop, which had a loan relationship with the shop, to stop lending money. Shen and Zheng, because of their anger towards Jin Chuxiang, a standing committee member of the Fish Industry Inspection and Anti-Counterfeit Committee, led mechanics to the committee to cause trouble. Afterwards, the committee reported to the Municipal Party Department and requested a disposition. After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Department immediately sent personnel to investigate. The day before yesterday, Shen was summoned to the department for questioning, but Shen avoided going to the department. Yesterday morning, the Municipal Party Department specifically sent investigator Yu Yaoqiu to the shop to ask Shen the reason for not going, but Shen used the excuse that the shop was located in the concession and the Municipal Party Department should not interfere, and made some irregular actions towards Yu. Yu then endured it and left, and went to see Zhang Zhisheng, chairman of the Salted Fish Trade Association, and gave him three days to instruct the member of the association, Hengchang Shop, to submit rebuttal evidence to the department that the shop had not sold poisonous Japanese dried Dongkou flatfish for verification. It is also known that the Municipal Party Department suspects that Zhang Zhisheng, chairman of the Salted Fish Trade Association, had a bias in this matter. Therefore, the Party Department is also investigating in detail.</p>

<p>Audience Forbidden and Windows Closed During the Trial</p>
<p>The Two Murderers Were Neatly Dressed and Very Composed</p>
<p>The Portuguese Consul Expressed That They Must Be Transferred to the Macao Court for Trial</p>
<p>The murderer and accomplice in the trunk corpse case were arrested at No. 174, C block, Yifeng Lane, at 2:55 PM on the 14th by the patrol room together with the Japanese police chief and sent to the Xiamen Road West Prison for detention, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Portuguese Consulate interrogated the murderers yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Portuguese Consulate Interrogated the Murderers <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The main murderer in the trunk corpse case, Bartolomeu Mitello, and his brother, the accomplice José Mitello, were arrested and detained in the Xiamen Road West Prison. The Portuguese Consulate formally interrogated them yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. This case caused a sensation in Shanghai, and many people were paying attention to it. Therefore, after 8:00 AM, there were many people on the road between Ma'erxi'ai Road and Lafayede Road going to the Portuguese Consulate to observe the trial, and many foreigners residing in Shanghai also went to the consulate to observe the trial, especially Portuguese nationals. By 9:00 AM, most of them had arrived, but unfortunately, the Portuguese Consulate forbade the audience from attending the trial of this case, so all those who went to the consulate to observe the trial were kept outside the consulate and could not enter. Although the courtroom could be seen, it was impossible to enter, so they could only sigh in vain. At 10:45 AM, William, the head of the patrol room's western patrol, had escorted the two defendants, the main murderer and the accomplice, from the Xiamen Road West Prison to the Portuguese Consulate. Dr. Sherve, the Portuguese Consul, questioned them about the case.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Two Defendants Were Not Afraid at All <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Before the main murderer Bartolomeu Mitello got out of the car in front of the consulate, he walked into the consulate wearing a navy blue Western suit and white canvas trousers. His brother was wearing a dark gray suit, also with white canvas trousers. The clothes seemed newly made, and his face also seemed newly repaired, so he was quite neat. When the two criminals walked into the consulate, they saw many people watching on both sides, but the two of them did not show any fear at all, and their faces were smiling, without any timidity. They walked in proudly. When the two criminals arrived at the consulate, they sat down in the defendant's seat in the temporary courtroom set up by the consulate. After forty minutes, Dr. Sherve, the Portuguese Consul, together with Inspector Leicester and Secretary Bai Laigai, sat up in the courtroom to question them. The Portuguese Consul wore a black suit and was very solemn.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Municipal Government Sent Personnel to Observe the Trial <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The victim in this case was indeed Chinese, not named Lu, but Zhang Cailian, a native of Guangdong. Her birth mother was in Shanghai. When she was young, she was bought by an American as a maid. She used to live at No. 9, Block B, Hainning Road. Later, she stole her master's property and escaped, and then lived on Wusong Road. She fell in love with the murderer Bartolomeu. When this case occurred, our Municipal Government paid close attention to it. Now that the murderer has been arrested and interrogated at the Portuguese Consulate, the Municipal Government specifically notified the Portuguese Consul in advance and sent Counselor Luo Panhui to the court to observe the trial with an official document. Because yesterday was the date for the preliminary hearing, it was only a temporary inquiry, and everything was waiting for the Portuguese Consulate to jointly interrogate the witnesses with the patrol room, etc. After the official trial is opened, another notification will be given, so Luo returned to the Municipal Government to report.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Defendant Hires Lawyer for Defense <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>After the two defendants were brought into the consular court, they sat silently in the defendant's seat on the right side of the courtroom, occasionally looking out at the spectators. The two defendants had hired lawyer Gu Lun as their defense attorney. Yesterday, Gu Lun also arrived in court, wearing his lawyer's robes. He studied the facts of the case in detail and repeatedly questioned the two defendants, but this was not audible to those outside the court.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Investigation of Evidence Begins First <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>At 11:30 AM, the Portuguese Consul Dr. Xue Erfo and the court clerk ascended to the bench together. The various documents and crime reports obtained by the police and Japanese police chief were read aloud by the court clerk, Bai Laijie. The two defendants were then asked if they admitted to the points mentioned, and whether they had murdered the Cantonese woman Zhang Cailian. During the interrogation, Bade Lie was questioned first, while his brother was taken out of the courtroom so that the two would not know what the other was saying. Each person was questioned for about fifteen minutes. At 11:50 AM, the second defendant was brought in for questioning. During the interrogation, because there were too many spectators outside the consulate and some were taking photographs, the Portuguese Consul ordered all the windows to be closed to isolate the court proceedings from the outside world. The interrogation ended at 12:10 PM. It was heard that the preliminary investigation revealed that the Portuguese Consul had ordered an investigation of the details of the murder and the scene of the crime at the intersection of Kunshan Road and Jiaxing Road that afternoon, as well as the collection of evidence, before scheduling another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Two Defendants Returned to Western Prison <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After yesterday's preliminary hearing, Gu Lun, the defense lawyer for the two defendants, was said to have requested that the defendants be temporarily released on bail, with the understanding that they would be available upon request. However, the police and the Portuguese Consul both believed that the nature of the two men's crimes was too serious to be treated as ordinary cases, so bail was denied. After the interrogation, the two defendants were still handed over to Western Head Constable Williams, who escorted them to the Western Prison on Xiamen Road to await the formal scheduled trial. They were transported to the prison by car.</p>

<p>Zhang Tiansheng, the landlord of No. 15 Jiaxing Road, had vaguely heard groaning sounds when the crime occurred. Although Zhang Tiansheng did not know that the body of the murdered woman was inside when the box containing the body was taken out, he had witnessed the box. Therefore, yesterday, Zhang Tiansheng, along with Wang A'gen, worker No. 7 on the dock, Zhang Tiansheng's wife, and another Japanese person, were summoned by the Japanese consulate to the police station to identify the coffin. According to Zhang Tiansheng, the box was indeed carried downstairs from the upper floor of his house by a Portuguese youth on the 5th and loaded onto a rickshaw. Wang A'gen, the coolie, also testified that the box was indeed from the Shanghai Maru.</p>

<p>After the box containing the body arrived in Japan, in addition to some of the boxes that had already been returned to Shanghai, there were still various types of evidence items such as the clothes of the deceased woman, totaling three items, consisting of eighteen items. When the Nagasaki Maru arrived in Shanghai, they were brought to Shanghai by Hayashi Tojuro, the criminal section chief of the Kobe Water Police, and have now been completely handed over to the Japanese Consulate to be presented at the trial.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the Portuguese suspects in the Shanghai Maru box murder case, Bade Lie Li Midiao and his brother Qiu Shafu Li Midiao, had a preliminary hearing in the Portuguese Consular Court this morning. The charges against them were for the crime of murdering the Cantonese woman Zhang Cailian. After Consul Xue Fula arrived in court at 11:30 AM, he immediately summoned Bade Lie to read out the charges against him and asked if he was guilty. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Afterwards, Qiu Shafu was summoned to read out the charges against him as before, and Qiu Shafu also pleaded not guilty. Shortly thereafter, the court adjourned and postponed the trial for eight days to continue investigating the evidence and summon other witnesses. According to Portuguese authorities, the details of the preliminary hearing will not be released until the preliminary hearing is completed. If the preliminary hearing finds them guilty, the case will be transferred to the Macau court for trial due to the seriousness of the case, as the Portuguese Consulate has no jurisdiction to hear it.</p>

<p>Opium Addict Follows Bandit Closely, Bandit Suspects He's Being Tracked</p>
<p>Police Officer Hears Gunshots and Investigates, Bandit Runs Out of Options</p>
<p>Two People Die Tragically After Successive Gunshots</p>
<p>At 3:45 AM yesterday morning, a case of a bandit mistakenly opening fire and killing a passerby and a police officer occurred near Xiangyan Bridge in the jurisdiction of the third precinct of the fifth district of Zhabei. The following is a description of the findings of the investigation:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Increasingly Degenerate <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Xu Jinlong, 40 years old, from Yangzhou, settled with his mother, Xu Chen, in No. 4, Lane 147, Tiantong Road, Zhabei, ten years ago. At that time, Xu was a tailor, so his life was quite self-sufficient. Unexpectedly, he made bad friends and became increasingly degenerate, associating with hooligans all day long and becoming addicted to opium. His mother repeatedly tried to persuade him to change, but he refused, so she hated him deeply and immediately ordered him to leave and never return to the family. However, Jinlong not only did not change after this, but became even worse, living his rogue life. However, without any source of income, he soon went from being a rogue to a beggar. During the day, he wandered the streets, and at night he slept in the Shenjiawan area of Jiaxing Road, Zhabei. When he occasionally got a small amount of money, he went to the opium dens on Tongzhou Road in Hongkou to enjoy the pleasures of opium.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Following Closely <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Jinlong had just gathered a few small coins when his opium addiction suddenly struck. He walked from Shenjiawan to Tongzhou Road, intending to go to an opium den to satisfy his craving. When he passed Jiaotong Road, he saw a person wearing a short shirt and pants running frantically in front of him. He thought it was someone rushing on their way, so he didn't pay attention. However, Jinlong was so addicted to opium at this time that he couldn't hold on for long, so he unconsciously quickened his pace. However, the latter had no intention, while the former was wary. When he approached Songjia Lane, the person wearing the short shirt and pants turned out to be a bandit. When he looked back and saw Jinlong following closely behind him, and it was difficult to distinguish in the darkness, he mistakenly thought that a detective was chasing him and decided to strike first. He took out a pistol from his side and fired a shot at Jinlong.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Two Shots to the Abdomen <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The shot hit Jinlong's left palm, and blood flowed like a fountain. However, after being injured, Xu remained calm and took advantage of the fact that the bandit who fired the shot in front was turning around to run away, and tried his best to catch up, hoping to hold him back. Unexpectedly, the bandit also ran wildly. After chasing for a while, the bandit saw that Jinlong was about to catch up, so he turned around and fired a second shot at Xu, hitting Jinlong's abdomen. After suffering this injury, Xu almost fell down, but he still fled while injured. When he reached the vicinity of Hujia Wooden Bridge, he collapsed due to exhaustion. At the same time, blood flowed all over the ground, and he was barely breathing. At this time, Zhang Chonghui, a police officer on duty at post No. 23 of the third precinct of the fifth district on Linping Road, heard gunshots and was patrolling around. When he came to that place, he was discovered and asked Xu what had happened. Xu was unable to speak and only pointed in a direction with his hand. Officer Zhang then followed the direction forward.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Besieged on All Sides <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>At this time, the bandit had already crossed Jiaotong Road, passed through Songjia Lane, climbed over the bamboo fence, passed through Huachangli, and then Wuhua Road, and then Tianbao Road. The bandit had fired another shot along the way to show his power, so all the police officers on duty were able to find out the bandit's whereabouts, followed the sound to arrest him, and each took precautions. Before long, Officer Zhang had chased him to Tianbao Road. When the bandit saw this, he fled towards Taiping Bridge, but this place was guarded by Wei Xisheng, a police officer on duty at post No. 22 of the same precinct. Seeing someone running towards him, he shouted for him to stop and made a gesture of firing a gun. Seeing that his way forward and backward was blocked, the bandit turned towards Zhangjiaxiang Road and Linping Road. Unexpectedly, this place was blocked by Fan Yaoshan, a 30-year-old police officer from Anhui on duty at post No. 24 and No. 3026. At the same time, Officers Zhang and Wei chased from both sides, each holding a rifle, and fired a shot at the bandit.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Successive Tragic Deaths <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, it was late at night and it was difficult to distinguish things in the darkness, so none of the shots hit. Seeing that he was surrounded on all sides, the bandit was extremely anxious. He pulled out his gun and fired a shot forward. Fan Yaoshan was the first to be hit, the bullet hitting his abdomen. He fell to the ground immediately. Seeing that there was no one blocking his way, the bandit took advantage of the dim morning light and fled without a trace. All the officers and police of the third precinct of the fifth district pursued him without success. They immediately sent the injured Xu Jinlong and police officer Fan Yaoshan to the Hongkou Tongren Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. It was just after five o'clock. After Dr. Xu Chongen of the hospital performed surgery, Xu Jinlong died at 10:00 AM due to his severe injuries. The bullet in Officer Fan's abdomen was removed at around 11:00 AM, but his intestines were severely damaged, and his condition was quite bad. Unexpectedly, his condition suddenly changed at around 2:00 PM, and his body temperature also increased. Dr. Xu urgently injected him with a cardiac stimulant, but it was ineffective. At 3:00 PM, Officer Fan, who was injured on duty, also died in the hospital. The hospital reported the deaths to the police and the third precinct of the fifth district one after another. The bodies were transported to the coroner's office to await examination by the court this morning. At the same time, Director Wen of the third precinct of the fifth district had prepared a document to report to the headquarters and notified the other precincts to pursue and arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Triangular Love Affair Leads to Bloodshed <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jinfeng's Fickleness Causes Great Disaster</p>
<p>Chen Deyin Stabs Others and Then Stabs Himself and Takes Poison</p>
<p>At around 7:50 PM the night before last, a case of a triangular love affair leading to a bloody tragedy occurred at No. 8 Shenyuli, Roberts Road, West Shanghai. The truth is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e161">Lodging with a Construction Worker <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jinfeng, a woman from Changzhou, is just twenty years old and has a pretty face. Because life in the countryside was difficult, she came to Shanghai at the beginning of this year and lodged with Chen Zhou, a fellow villager, at No. 8 Shenyuli, Roberts Road, West Shanghai. Later, she asked someone to introduce her to work at the Zhengda Cotton Mill. Chen Zhou is 61 years old and has a daughter named Xiaoda, who is only 17 years old and also works at the Gongyi Cotton Mill. Therefore, the two women spent their days together and were very close, and Chen Zhou also regarded Jinfeng as her own daughter and loved her very much.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Triangular Love Affair <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>In April of this year, Chen Deyin, a carpenter from Jiangbei, 25 years old, rented a berth at Chen Zhou's house since he had no family in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he soon fell in love with Jinfeng. Jinfeng was just at the age of blossoming, so the two were very passionate and had secret affairs many times. However, due to his work, Chen often had to stay overnight outside, and he went to another port for a few days at the beginning of last month. Unexpectedly, Jinfeng was fickle and, during this period, had an affair with Yao Zilin, a waiter at the nearby Tang Yongmao Hotel. Yao often came to Chen Zhou's house and had secret affairs with Jinfeng. People were talking about it, and Chen found out about it. Thus, the sea of jealousy in this triangular love affair stirred up a huge wave.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Tragedy Occurs <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Chen was consumed by jealousy and often thought of getting rid of Yao, but he had no chance to take advantage of. The day before yesterday evening, Chen returned from outside and suddenly saw Yao and Jinfeng sitting together and playing. He was furious. He secretly hid a sharp blade and said to Jinfeng, "The hotel room has been opened, let's go quickly." Yao heard this and cursed. Chen pulled out the sharp blade and stabbed Yao five times, one in the left wrist, one in each shoulder, and two in the back. Yao was immediately injured, bleeding and falling to the ground. Chen also felt resentful towards Chen Zhou for not stopping Yao from coming, so he turned around and stabbed her in the wrist twice. Seeing that he had caused a great disaster, Chen immediately grabbed a bottle of poison that he had prepared in advance (Chen Zhou said it was corrosive acid), poured it into his stomach, and then used the sharp blade he was holding to commit suicide, stabbing himself in the chest five times. Blood flowed like a fountain, and he fainted from the pain. Chen Zhou's daughter, Chen Xiaoda, was shocked and immediately ran to report to the police on duty. Police Chief Song Chengfa first sent the injured Chen Deyin, Yao Zilin, and Chen Zhou to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After the doctor applied medicine and bandages to Yao and Chen Zhou, he took them back to the sixth district. He also took the main characters, Zhang Jinfeng and Chen Xiaoda, back to the district together.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Both Sent to Court <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>After District Officer Jiang interrogated them separately, they were all vague and unwilling to tell the truth. Chen Deyin's injuries were severe, and the poison was taking effect, so his life was in danger. Yesterday, a document was prepared to transfer them to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Zhou Miaoying Yearns for Her Son, Zhang Qu'an Disregards His Birth Mother <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Miaoying Suffers from Poverty and Illness, Begging Qu'an in Vain</p>
<p>Believes That Zhang Xu Is Instigating and Has Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhou Miaoying, a woman from this county, once belonged to the entertainment industry. She became acquainted with Zhang Shiming, the richest man in Nanxun, who was traveling in Shanghai. Zhang took her as a concubine, and she gave birth to a son named Qu'an. Later, Zhang's first wife died, so he married Xu as his second wife. After Xu married into the family, she treated Zhou Miaoying cruelly and did not allow them to live together. Zhou then left and took temporary refuge with the Qi family. In 1927, Shiming passed away, and Xu surrounded Qu'an, preventing him from meeting his mother. Zhou Miaoying then sued Qu'an in court, requesting support. At that time, Zhou was in financial straits and heavily in debt. Xu paid her 40,000 yuan and ordered her to withdraw the lawsuit. Two years ago, Xu married her niece to Qu'an, without seeking the consent of his birth mother. On the day of the wedding, Zhou heard the news and rushed there, but was surrounded and unable to see her son. Therefore, Zhou hired lawyers Yuan Yang'an and Zhang Zhirang to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Xu and Qu'an to confirm their mother-son relationship. The first trial was lost, and the appeal also failed. A third appeal was made, and the Supreme Court ruled that the original judgment was overturned and confirmed that Zhang Qu'an and Zhou Miaoying had a mother-son relationship. This case has been in litigation for three years, and this newspaper has previously reported on it in detail. However, since the Supreme Court's ruling, Zhang Xu has continued to surround Qu'an, preventing him from fulfilling all the obligations of the Supreme Court's judgment. Zhou Miaoying believes that Qu'an's behavior is due to Zhang Xu's surrounding and instigating, so she still hired lawyers Yuan and Zhang to file a complaint in the criminal court of the First Special District, accusing Zhang Xu of instigating abandonment. There is a passage in her complaint that is quite tragic, stating that the plaintiff has been groaning in bed for several years, and the cost of medical treatment has been enormous, and she has long been equivalent to a cripple. Since last autumn and winter, her illness has become increasingly severe, and she has been in danger of death several times. Recently, she has also owed rent for more than six months and has been forced to move out by the landlord's lawsuit. Her remaining clothes and utensils have been sealed. The plaintiff was previously in critical condition and had no money for medical treatment, and she was forced to escape because of debt and had no way to escape. She sent a letter to Qu'an, begging him to provide relief and come to her bedside to see her, but Qu'an was still suppressed by the defendant and did not reply. She then sent a letter to the defendant, begging her not to restrict Qu'an's actions, but she still ignored her. The late husband, Shiming, was a wealthy man in Jiangnan, and Qu'an's inheritance was no less than ten million. He lives in tall buildings and luxurious houses, spending hundreds of gold every day. The plaintiff, in her critically ill state, not only has no money for medical treatment, but also has no house to live in. She is about to beg on the streets and die in a ditch. Such filial piety is lacking, and the abandonment of a person who should be supported by law is nothing more than the result of the defendant's instigation. Therefore, she specially requests that she be punished according to Article 43 and Article 311, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened Criminal Court 8 and summoned her for trial. The original complaint stated that the defendant lived at No. 928 Xinchangli, Fujian Road, but according to the bailiff's report, the address was unknown and could not be delivered. Only Zhou Miaoying arrived in court. Zhou looked haggard and walked with difficulty. She arrived in court with lawyers Yuan and Zhang. Because the defendant had not arrived, the court could not proceed and ordered that the hearing be postponed.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Five Assassins of Newspaper Vendor Zhou Yiting Arrested <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Rivalry Due to Business Disputes</p>
<p>Municipal Police Bureau Also Arrests an Accomplice</p>
<p>Zhou Yiting, also known as Lao Wu, the chief newspaper vendor of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, was hacked to death with an axe by his enemies at 6:15 AM on March 22 of this year in Shanqingli, Er'jin Road. The murderer escaped from the scene without a trace and has been at large for half a year. The police have issued a wanted notice. At around 3:00 AM the day before yesterday, Hua Detective Shang Wu and Detective Liu Decheng of the Diss Will Road Police Station arrested five suspects, Wang Gengsheng from Suzhou, Xu A'bao (also known as Lao Kai) from Shanghai, Shi Xiangsheng (also known as Jinsheng) and Tong Baoxing from Hangzhou, and Yang Liangrong (also known as A'san) from Ningbo, at No. 193 and No. 207 Er'jin Road and No. 6 Tongzhou Road, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the trial. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that there was another accomplice, Wu Shibao, who had been arrested by the Public Security Bureau in the Chinese area, and that the police planned to transfer him with an official letter. He requested that the hearing be postponed. When questioned, the defendant Wang Gengsheng confessed that he went with Xu A'bao, Wu Shibao, A'mao, and others at the time. He held an axe, and Xu A'bao also held an axe. They waited in Shanqingli. According to them, they were going to fight. After a while, Zhou Lao Wu came out of his house. Wu Shibao pointed him out, and he stepped forward and raised his axe to hack him twice, once on the right shoulder and once on the left leg. He then fell to the ground. Xu A'bao also hacked him once. Shi Xiangsheng was guarding the entrance of the lane. It was Xu A'bao who invited him to go. The axe was also brought by Wu Shibao. He received 62 yuan afterwards. Xu A'bao confessed that he did not know Zhou Lao Wu. He was invited to go by Gao A'mao. Wang Gengsheng was sent by him to go together. There were five people in total, namely Wang Gengsheng, Gao A'mao, Wu Shibao, Shi Xiangsheng, and him. When they saw Zhou Lao Wu, A'mao and Shibao shouted to attack. He then stepped forward and hacked him once. He could not remember where he hacked him. Shi Xiangsheng was the instigator. He had business disputes with Zhou Lao Wu, which led to accumulated grudges. He received 63 yuan afterwards. This matter had been discussed for a long time and they had gone three times but had not encountered him. Shi Xiangsheng confessed that he used to be a small newspaper vendor at Zhou Lao Wu's place, but he was fired by him. Later, he met his friends Xia Renliang, Pan Hongsheng, and Yang A'zai (also known as Liangrong) at the Laifeng Teahouse on Jielu Road. They talked about plotting to murder Zhou Lao Wu. He was joking, but they all agreed. Xia Renliang and Yang A'san gave him 300 yuan. He invited Wu Shibao to help. Tong Baoxing confessed that he was a newspaper vendor with Zhou Lao Wu, Pan Hongsheng, Xia Renliang, and others. He had no grudges with Zhou. He did not participate in this matter. The police lawyer stated that the defendant and Shi Xiangsheng were relatives by marriage, so they conspired together. However, Tong firmly denied it. Yang Liangrong confessed that he had been working at the Shanghai Electric Power Company for 14 years. Zhou Lao Wu was his prospective father-in-law. He knew Shi Xiangsheng because he often went to Zhou's house. He had not heard of the conspiracy to murder him. They were all falsely accusing him. After Zhou was murdered, he had stated that anyone who wanted to take over his newspaper vending vacancy would be the murderer, so no one dared to talk to him. Shi and others resented him and falsely accused him. The police lawyer also stated that Shi Xiangsheng had wanted to harm Zhou Lao Wu before, and he knew about it. He strongly agreed and urged him to proceed quickly. Shi Xiangsheng claimed that the 300 yuan was indeed given by Yang Liangrong and Xia Renliang. It was delivered in two installments below the Laifeng Teahouse. Judge Xiao ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing.</p>

<p>Since Jiande Bank moved into its building at No. 16 North Henan Road and commenced operations, outsiders have often mistaken it as an incarnation of the Jiande Savings Society. In reality, the Jiande Savings Society is a savings institution exclusively for members of the Chinese Jiande Society, while Jiande Bank is an ordinary commercial savings bank. The two have different natures and their economies are unrelated. Outsiders, due to the similarity in their names, have thus been led to some misunderstandings.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Expansion Plan of Shanghai Guohuo Company <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guohuo Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, has been working on formulating an expansion plan since renting the building to the east. The outline of the plan is divided into five items: First, planning and constructing the facade; second, planning the interior layout; third, planning the necessary equipment; fourth, engaging in talent training; and fifth, preparing to expand the sales network. This plan has been handed over to the Business Development Committee for implementation starting from August 1st, with a fixed implementation period of six months, divided into three phases. The first to third items are to be completed within one and a half months as the first phase. The fourth item is to establish a foundation within one and a half months as the second phase. The fifth item, expanding the sales network, will be developed using the foundational strength built in the second phase over three months as the third phase. Once these three phases are completed, consumers in Shanghai who love using domestic goods will have sufficient convenience. According to the designers of the company, making Chinese people love domestic goods should be an easy task. The reason why this easy task has not made active progress amidst the advocacy of domestic goods is that the efforts to promote it have only focused on the promotion of slogans, without following up with practical steps after the promotion work. This will eventually enable the voice of advocating for domestic goods to gradually become a reality.</p>

<p>For the Station Road Vegetable Market Impeding the Livelihood of Jiangyin Street Vendors</p>
<p>Representatives Questioned the Charity Group, Who Were at a Loss for Words and Given a Seven-Day Deadline to Respond</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Standing on the Position of a Fellow Townsman, Also Agreed to Assist Ningbo Vendors</p>
<p>All male and female vendors of Jiangyin Street, because the construction of a vegetable market on Station Road, planned by the charity group, namely the construction project, is also undertaken by the charity group, and it hinders the livelihood of all vendors on Jiangyin Street, therefore, since finding out that the group would hold a meeting yesterday, they voluntarily gathered more than two hundred people, mostly elderly women selling vegetables, together with five rotating representatives Yan Hongxiang, Fan Gongliang, Du Jinbao, Yu Miaofa, Xu Chunhua, gathered at the Shanghai Charity Group on Qiaojia Road in the city to negotiate, questioning the construction of the vegetable market on Station Road, which hinders the livelihood of all of Jiangyin Street, requesting to cancel the construction to stabilize people's hearts. When the vendors arrived at the group, the group's hall happened to have a clinic, treating the poor and sick. All vendors, under the maintenance of order by the five representatives, therefore the order was very good, gathered in the hall, after the representatives handed over the official letter, the person in charge of the group, Mr. Ye, came out to see them. When Representative Yan repeatedly stated the questions, the old female vegetable vendors all cried bitterly, scolded each other, and the order was slightly chaotic. Representative Fan tried his best to persuade and maintain order, but the vendors still demanded an immediate responsible reply and cancellation of the construction. Without a satisfactory answer, they would rather starve to death within the group than return home. The two sides argued until after twelve o'clock. The group, because the hall was gathered by vendors, could not have lunch. The representatives persuaded them to stand in the courtyard, standing in the scorching sun, waiting for the group staff to have lunch. The vendors were all hungry. The representatives paid for five hundred steamed buns to distribute to the vendors to relieve their hunger. The five representatives also gorged on large cakes to fill their stomachs. After the group had lunch, they reported to the Third Precinct of the First District of the Public Security Bureau by phone, who sent Patrol Officers Zhang and Sun to maintain order. Representative Yan asked Mr. Ye again whether there would be a meeting today. Mr. Ye replied that it was too hot to avoid the summer heat, and the board of directors would not meet. Representative Yan again requested a responsible and satisfactory reply. Mr. Ye replied that the charity group would not oppose you holding a meeting. I am responsible for convening a board of directors meeting to discuss it and will reply in one week. Patrol Officers Zhang and Sun also asked the representatives to persuade all the vendors to return home and wait for a reply. The five representatives feared it was a delaying tactic and insisted on a responsible and concrete reply before informing the vendors. Otherwise, they would resign from their representative positions. The two patrol officers advised not to resign and also reported to the Social Bureau and the Public Security Bureau by phone. The Social Bureau sent Fourth Section staff member Chen Lengseng, and the Public Security Bureau sent Patrol Officer Wang Ziqin from the First Precinct of the Second District, to the charity group, and comforted the representatives and vendors. As a result, they were allowed to wait for a reply in one week. Patrol Officer Wang and Section Staff Chen ordered Patrol Officer Zhang to inform the three temporary representatives to enter for talks. Xu Chunhua, Yan Hongxiang, and Du Jinbao were sent. As a result, Patrol Officer Wang was responsible for giving a satisfactory reply in one week. If it was not satisfactory, they could appeal to the Social Bureau. The three representatives were satisfied and told all the vendors before returning to Jiangyin Street. It is also learned that most of the vendors are from Ningbo. Representative Zhang Mingchang was sent to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, requesting to stand on the position of a fellow townsman to help his fellow townsmen and relieve their suffering. Yesterday, Representative Zhang went to the Sanbei Company and met with Mr. Yu, stated the reasons, and was promised by Mr. Yu to provide assistance and send a letter to Mayor Wu to cancel the construction of the vegetable market in Station Road. Therefore, the date of resolution should not be far away.</p>

<p>Kefa Pharmacy's pharmaceutical factory, located at No. 1568 Huade Road and Ningguo Road, purchased the land on which the factory is built. The factory building covers a vast area and is well-equipped, with separate departments for Western medicine manufacturing, chemical testing, and fragrances. In total, the factory has everything related to hygiene products manufactured in the factory. Its scale is the largest among pharmaceutical factories in this city. However, at 11:40 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the fragrance workshop and warehouse. Thick smoke filled the air, and the flames roared. Because the workshop contained a large amount of perfume, fragrance oil, raw alcohol, and other materials, the fire spread easily, and the flames quickly broke through the roof, making it impossible to control. At that time, it was midnight, and the workers had already left work. Only a few staff members were on duty in the factory. Nearby residents and patrolmen discovered the fire and quickly dispatched patrolmen to inform the Central and Yangshupu fire brigades to send fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire. At the same time, the German factory director also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Seeing the valuable fragrances and other materials in the workshop and warehouse being burned, he could not help but shed tears. After the firefighters' best efforts, the fire was extinguished at 12:25 AM this morning. As a result, three fragrance workshops and warehouses were destroyed, resulting in heavy losses, which are difficult to estimate for the time being. When the reporter went to investigate and returned to the office, there were still embers in the workshop and warehouse, and firefighters were still continuing to put out the fire. The fragrance of the materials after the fire permeated the air and spread for miles. Afterwards, it was learned that the goods destroyed in the warehouse were mostly fragrance oils and floral water, while raw materials accounted for a large part of the workshop.</p>

When the Second Precinct of the Second District heard the alarm, it immediately dispatched a large number of policemen to the scene to maintain order and took the store owner's wife, Ms. Wang Fan, and the clerk, Chen Zhicheng, back to the precinct. Later, because the store had fire insurance of 6,000 taels and the cause of the fire was unknown, there was suspicion of arson. In addition to sending police to investigate the cause of the fire, they were ordered to prepare a document to send them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. However, at around 4:00 AM, the smoldering ashes in the store reignited, and the fire became uncontrollable again. The fire brigade was reported and sent to the scene to extinguish it. Later, at around 9:00 AM, another fire broke out, and the fire brigade was again driven to the scene to put out the fire.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>In your newspaper's local news section on the 13th of this month, there was a report stating that local gentry in Beiqiao petitioned for the preservation of an ancient Tang Dynasty site. This is completely untrue. After investigation, the ancient bell tower in Beiqiao was contracted to the Zhu Bingji Construction Company for 7,500 yuan. Since construction began on June 20th of this year, progress has been remarkably swift. The project is now more than half complete. The claim that local gentry recently submitted another petition to the county government for funds to start construction is completely untrue. I am writing to request that you investigate and promptly correct this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai County Government</p>

<p>Extended to the 18th</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) The Central Boxer Indemnity Fund is recruiting publicly funded students to study in the United Kingdom. The registration deadline was originally set for the 15th.

The appointed examination committee members for various locations including Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan are also departing for Nanjing to oversee the examinations.

<h3 id="e199">Ministry of Education Order on Free Adoption of Textbooks and Illustrated Books <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the Education Departments of various provinces, the Education Bureaus of Peiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Qingdao, and the Weihaiwei Administrative Office, stating that the review of textbooks and illustrated books should be uniformly handled by the ministry. The former University Council and the ministry have repeatedly issued orders to this effect. However, recent investigations have revealed that education administrative organs in various provinces, cities, and counties are still organizing textbook review committees and requiring all schools to uniformly adopt certain textbooks and illustrated books. This is inconsistent with the previous orders and Article 29 of the Elementary School Regulations, which stipulates that "schools should select and adopt [textbooks]." In the future, education administrative organs in various provinces, cities, and counties must not organize review committees to review textbooks and illustrated books that have already been reviewed and approved by the ministry. The adoption of textbooks should be handled carefully by the teachers in charge of the courses in each school, based on their practical experience in teaching, and no restrictions should be imposed. Otherwise, there is a risk that people may use their position to manipulate things in secret. It is difficult to describe the harm that this will cause. In addition to separate orders, the ministry urgently instructs that if there are organizations for textbook and illustrated book review committees in the provinces, cities, and counties under your jurisdiction, they should be abolished immediately. You are to take note of this. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Important Proposals at the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Library Association <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Funds and Savings Earmarked by Library Authorities</p>
<p>Regulations on the Minimum Budget for University Libraries</p>
<p>Libraries Should Establish Popular Departments to Develop Public Education</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) Yuan Tongli, Li Wenxun, and other members of the preparatory committee for the second annual meeting of the Chinese Library Association have been preparing for several days, compiling information for attendees, and dispatching personnel to receive attendees. They have also requested the Ministry of Railways to offer discounted train tickets. The preparatory committee received many proposals on the 13th. All proposals must be organized in advance. The reporter obtained three important proposals. The various situations and important proposals are listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Information for Attendees: (1) This annual meeting will be held at Tsinghua Scholar. The buildings and gardens of Tsinghua are magnificent and serene. Fragrant Hills, the Summer Palace, and other famous scenic spots surround it, making it a perfect place to rest during the summer. (2) All members attending the annual meeting will be accommodated and fed at the locations designated by the association (using the newly built dormitories of Tsinghua University). Those who wish to stay near their homes are also welcome. (3) From August 26th to 28th, staff from the reception group will meet members at the East and West Railway Stations in Peiping. (4) Continental Motor Company cars will be designated to depart from the station to Tsinghua University at scheduled times for members traveling to Tsinghua. (5) Members arriving at the station in Peiping do not need to carry their large luggage. The reception group will send personnel to take care of it properly. (6) Members attending the meeting should bring their own luggage, but it should be light. (7) Each member attending the meeting should pay an annual meeting fee of five yuan. The same applies to institutional members. (7) The reception group will print meal tickets for the members' meals at this annual meeting. Please collect them when registering. (9) The following discussion groups will be set up at the annual meeting. Members may join one or several groups and declare this at registration: (1) Library Administration Group, (2) Classification and Cataloging Group, (3) Library Funding Group, (4) Public Education Group, (5) Library Education Group, (6) Indexing Group. (10) Those who only purchase one-way train tickets and still need a certificate for discounted return fares should declare this at registration so that arrangements can be made on their behalf.</p>
<p>Important Proposals: (1) Proposal that library funding should be allocated by the competent authorities and libraries should have their own savings to avoid financial difficulties and facilitate operations. Submitted by the Nanjing Municipal Public Library. A. Justification: The establishment of libraries in China is nearly thirty years old. In 1930, the Ministry of Education conducted a survey and statistical analysis, combining general, specialized, public, school, and institutional libraries, totaling approximately 2,900. Although there may be some questions about these numbers, it can be said that their importance is recognized and they are becoming increasingly developed. However, in reality, not only are many libraries in counties and districts unable to carry out many tasks, but most of the established libraries in various provinces and cities are also makeshift and inadequate, focusing on one thing and losing sight of another, making it difficult to meet the demands of the people. The reason for this is the frequent turmoil and instability in the region, but the main cause is the lack of funding. It is inevitable that library funding will rely on the competent authorities, and the competent authorities are not entirely indifferent to this, but they are unable to do more than they can, or they are constrained by various problems. It is said that the annual budget of the Suiyuan Provincial Library is only several hundred yuan, which is extremely meager. If a way is not found to solve this problem, then there will be no progress in the future. Therefore, the competent authorities should allocate funds to cover the expenses of equipment, books, and affairs, rather than simply relying on the original public funds that fluctuate with changes. Libraries themselves should also have their own savings to serve as subsidies, to avoid being caught off guard by sudden emergencies. As the saying goes, "Long sleeves are good at dancing," and "Money is the mother of all things." Libraries are the central point of culture, the knowledge base of society, and the rise and fall of the nation depends on this. How can we be stingy with money and not plan for it early? B. Measures: (1) Competent Authorities: (1) Add an additional amount to the tax revenue and designate it for library use, following the example of adding a school tax when running schools in China in the past. (2) Allocate a certain amount or all of the fines to supplement the library. (3) Allocate surplus funds to supplement the library. (2) Libraries Themselves: (1) Add a budget item when preparing the annual budget and receive it monthly, depositing it in the bank for future use. (2) The proceeds from the sale of publications (such as books and newspapers) are deposited in the bank for future use (although this is done, it is extremely rare). (3) Charge a fee for those who come to the library for reference and research (not for ordinary visitors) and deposit it in the bank for use. The above is a proposal based on my limited knowledge. I hope that it is appropriate and that the public will decide. (2) Proposal to regulate the minimum budget for university libraries. Submitted by Gui Zhibai, a member from Nanjing. A. Justification: University libraries are active undertakings that require daily development. The equipment of university libraries in the country is mostly imperfect. If this continues, I am deeply afraid that the source of knowledge will be cut off and academic standards will decline. The reason for this is the uncertainty of funding, which is due to insufficient funds. Today, the Ministry of Education is striving to reorganize higher education, and it is appropriate for the conference to request the Ministry of Education to quickly stipulate a percentage of the school's budget that should be the minimum spent on [university] libraries nationwide, in order to seek educational efficiency. B. Measures: The conference should request the Ministry of Education to investigate the general situation of universities and their funding across the country, first formulate principles, and then stipulate the minimum standards for library funding and promulgate them for implementation. For example, the minimum standards for the library of a university can be stipulated as follows: If the annual budget of a university is more than one million yuan, the library budget should account for at least 10%; if it is below one million yuan and above five hundred thousand yuan, the library budget should account for 15%; and if it is below five hundred thousand yuan, the library budget should account for 20%. (3) Proposal to establish popular departments in libraries and promote circulation methods to develop public education. Submitted by the Nanjing Municipal Public Library. A. Justification: The increase in people's knowledge and the excellence of their education all depend on education. The general term "education" refers to schools. However, school education cannot be truly universal and is compulsory rather than free, temporary rather than permanent. However, libraries are the opposite. There is no distinction between classes, no matter how old or young, no difference between genders, and no regional restrictions. Anyone can enter the library at any time and choose books to read according to their preferences. Therefore, library education is public education. However, today's public and private libraries in China are not entirely the same. They follow the remaining style of藏書樓 [traditional Chinese library], although they also call themselves reading rooms, but the books they contain are mostly highly academic and suitable for scholars to consult, but not suitable for the needs of the majority of the public. The gates are heavy and lack a lively atmosphere, so they cannot be called public education. The public refers to all people and also contains the meaning of "popular". In 1915, in addition to issuing library regulations, the Ministry of Education also issued popular library regulations, with good intentions. As a result, the establishment of popular libraries has sprung up, and recently many are called public libraries. The books in this type of library should be simple and clear, so that readers can easily understand them, and practical. I still worry that their establishment is not complete, and specialized and ordinary libraries should also quickly plan to remedy the situation, widely implement circulation methods, and preserve the meaning of "popular", so that literate people have the opportunity to read, so that they can follow the rules when working and earning a living, and participate in politics and self-government. Their benefits to the country are not small. B. Measures: (1) Public and private specialized or ordinary libraries should set up popular reading departments in the library to allow people with basic education to enter and read. (2) All central libraries in provinces and cities should establish branch libraries to promote reading. (3) Mobile book cars or mobile book boxes and shelves should be set up (the Zhejiang Library and the Zhejiang Circulation Library have already done this, and our library is also planning to implement mobile book cars) for mobile reading. (4) More library agency points should be established to expand circulation. (5) More newspaper reading rooms or newspaper boards should be set up (our library has set up 40 newspaper boards) so that people can be aware of current affairs. (6) Library exhibitions should be held frequently to arouse people's interest. (7) More village libraries should be established to increase the knowledge of villagers. Although some of the above methods have been implemented or are already planned, the number is quite small. I sincerely hope that they will be widely promoted and effectively developed in the future. It is necessary to extend the use of books to the lower levels of society, then the power of public education will be greater than that of libraries. Is this appropriate? I respectfully ask for a public decision.</p>

<p>From the 15th to the 19th of This Month</p>
<p>For the convenience of high school students who participated in this year's entrance exam but did not complete all the required subjects or failed one or two subjects, the Municipal Education Bureau will issue certificates separately for temporary enrollment in schools and participation in the next supplementary exam. The deadline for issuing these certificates was originally set for the 10th of this month. However, as it is currently the summer vacation, many students from other places have returned home and have not been informed of this. Therefore, although the deadline has passed, there has been a continuous stream of requests for certificates. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the deadline by four days, from the 15th to the 19th of this month, to continue issuing these certificates. No further extensions will be granted after the deadline.</p>

<p>Chen Dezheng, the principal of Jianguo Middle School in Zhabei, has established educational subsidy places for poor students in the high school department to help students from impoverished families who are striving to learn. Students who are admitted to the school with a subsidy will be exempt from tuition and accommodation fees. It is learned that the school has already completed the entrance examination for the subsidy places for the past two days, and the admitted students have been notified by the school. It is said that this examination required preparation for social service, which was raised, and the supervision was very strict. Therefore, the number of students who applied and were admitted was not as many as expected. As a result, there are still five places available for the first year of high school and two places for the second and third years of high school. In order to fill these places, the school has decided to hold examinations at any time. Children from poor families with good character and academic performance can continue to apply to the school for the examination.</p>

<h3 id="e211">[Marker] Tennis Tournament <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>[Marker] is a transliteration of Marker.</p>
<p>Enthusiasts Initiate</p>
<p>[Marker] in the Tennis Club is specifically responsible for managing the tennis court and assisting members with tennis practice. There are over a hundred [Markers] in various Chinese and foreign tennis clubs in Shanghai. [Markers'] tennis skills are generally of intermediate level. For example, Wang Wenzheng, who won the Chinese Open Singles Championship this time, and Qian Wensai, who won the Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Junior Singles Championship in 1931, both came from the ranks of [Markers]. Even the world-famous French tennis player Cochet also came from the ranks of [Markers]. In European and American countries, it is common to see athletes, whether professional or amateur, who have come from the ranks of [Markers], especially in golf, billiards, and tennis. The quality of [Markers'] tennis skills is closely related to the progress of members' tennis skills. Therefore, [Markers] are essentially coaches in tennis clubs.</p>
<p>[Markers'] Position In Shanghai tennis, there are quite a few [Markers] with excellent techniques, but the tennis skills of ordinary [Markers] also need to be improved. This is because [Markers] have a great influence on the progress of amateur tennis players' techniques. If [Markers'] techniques are excellent, amateur players' techniques will also improve easily. Especially since our country has no professional tennis instructors who can coach amateur players, tennis [Markers'] position is particularly important in China's tennis world.</p>
<p>Preparation and Initiation The reporter once chatted with Mr. Li Baojun, the manager of the Chinese tennis team, and suggested initiating a Shanghai [Marker] tennis tournament. It is now learned that Mr. Li is proceeding with this matter. The reporter met Zhang Kaisheng, a [Marker] from the Chinese Tennis Club, yesterday. According to Zhang, he is contacting [Markers] from various Western tennis associations to ensure that [Markers] from all tennis clubs can participate and strive to make this tournament a reality.</p>
<p>Realization Soon The prizes for this tournament have been donated by the East China Sports Company. The location for the tournament will be the tennis court of the China Sports Association at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road. The registration fee is two yuan per person if borne by the tennis association, and one yuan per person if borne by the [Marker] themselves. Mr. Li is currently preparing for this matter, and it is expected to be realized soon.</p>

<p>Swap Longs Pay in $5.5 to $6.5</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw British and American silver markets both fall, and the exchange rate also narrowed. The price of forward silver on the Five Metals Exchange fell by 0.71 to 0.77 cents. The private telegraph silver price fell by 0.3125. American wheat was unchanged, and American cotton was slightly higher by 0.19 pounds per ton. Stocks fell by a little less than one yuan. The wool market opened and rose to $73.4, but although it rose, it still retreated. When the market opened, it initially appeared to be hovering. HSBC's listed exchange rate for the pound sterling narrowed by 0.0125, and the US dollar fell by 0.5 yuan. Later, it turned firm, probably due to the swap relationship. In the end, the banks were still firm. Reuters reported that the US Special Committee had completed a compromise plan for rural relief, which would reduce the amount of subsidies to farmers who reduced cotton and wheat production by 200 million yuan, and retain a small portion to repay their debts to the government, and strongly urged the government to stabilize agricultural product prices. The selling wind then arose. Shenkang failed in the article-by-article advertising help and was frustrated. In the latter market, it was initially low due to the large release of raw materials, but in the end, it was still stable. The price of cooked red was increased by $180. In this swap market, the longs paid in $5.5 to $6.5. The market conditions for today will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $876, an increase of $10.012 from the previous close. Articles opened at $5.5, and the foreign exchange market also opened tightly. The near-term selling price was 1 shilling and 2.75 pence for the British pound, and $27.4375 for the US dollar. Although Shunli sold from $6.2 to $5, Citibank cut the August price by $0.5, while Hengyu, Hongli, Yuanxing, Yongda, Decheng, etc., went to $8.2. Magali sold November US dollars at $875, and then Mitsui even offered the same month at $9375. Yuanfeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanheng, Dafa, Yong, etc., sold together and fell to $5.2. Qian Changxiang and Hengxing took the opportunity to buy at a low price and stabilized. It was learned that HSBC's listed British exchange rate narrowed by 0.0125, and the US dollar narrowed by 0.5 yuan. Hengxing, Yuan Fuchang, Zhaofeng, Chang Bingxing, and Likou bought, and the price rose to $9.8, which was $0.5 for the September US dollar. $6.875 for November was difficult to close. Shunli, Yuanmao, Yongrui, and Kang all did not sell. HSBC Zhejiang came out with $6.25 for the October US dollar and fell to $8, but Hengxing, Hongxing, Hengyu, Fuyu, and Hengtai all bought in, and the price rose to $80.06. Those who sold at high prices were surging. Tongyi articles were sold again and struggled around $80. After the market, because the foreign exchange market had not improved, North Korea came out with $6.875 for the November US dollar. Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yong Wanxing, Daxing Yong, Fuchang, and Zhentai sold off in order. Unfavorable overseas news caused the price to fall to $75.8. The noon close was $875.9. Articles auctioned for $5.</p>
<p>In the later market, Zhongfu ate $9.375 for the November US dollar and once rose to $7. Guangbang, Dalianbang, and Tianfeng Yong all sold. The opening price was $875.8. Articles opened at $5.9. Although Bingxing, Yuanheng, Dafa Yong, Daxing Yong, etc., bought in, the price retreated below $6.7 due to the strong sales of raw materials. However, it still hovered around $6. Mitsui and Huabi came out with $9.375 for the November US dollar. Raw materials were fiercely released. Yuansheng, Yongtian, Fengyong, Yuanfeng Yong, Zhengchang, etc., also sold. Mitsui and Huabi again bought $28 for November and fell to $3.2. After that, the price gradually stabilized, and the swap premium gradually rose. The gold market also stabilized. Zhifeng Yong, Yuanchun, Yicheng, Hongli, Yifeng, Yongdaxing Yong, Zhengchang, etc., in the market suddenly bought articles together again. Datong sold $0.5 for August to HSBC. The closing price was pulled up to $877. After the closing, because Zhengchang and Hengxing both bought in, the price actually rose to $8.5. Articles auctioned for $7.5. It was found that the highest price during the day was $880.06, and the lowest price was $873.2, with a fluctuation of $7.4. As a result, it rose $11.3 more than the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was because HSBC Bank's US dollar listing price narrowed by $0.5 to $27. The standard gold price was $889, which, according to the closing price, was about $12 less, which was about $5 less than the previous close.

<p>Trading Hours and Number of Lots at the Stock Exchange Will Be Slightly Changed Starting Next Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange was even more stagnant, and the trend was even more cyclical. Although large investors slightly entered and exited, the prices were extremely cautious. Those who entered found an increase of 0.05 yuan too expensive, while those who exited found a decrease of 0.05 yuan too cheap. Therefore, the market became even more stable. In the morning, the opening and closing of the two trading sessions saw market prices fluctuate between 0.05 yuan and 0.1 yuan. Although No. 47 slightly increased its position, No. 4 also had a considerable exit. The forces were evenly matched and mutually insistent. Scattered retail investors were not enthusiastic about entering or exiting, and trading felt even more leisurely. Whether it rose or fell, it did not exceed a range of about 0.1 yuan. Although No. 47 had a slight need, No. 4 also happened to have a slight sale, resulting in mutual insistence that led to alternating increases and decreases in market prices, but all within a range of 0.05 yuan to 0.15 yuan. Only the Jin Chang stock fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan, making it the most significant change. The total transaction volume was 4,154,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot goods.

<p>The 80 Yuan Mark for Yarn This Month Will Likely Be Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>The yarn market is somewhat weak, and raw cotton is trending downward. Some factories are selling, and the bulls are finding it increasingly difficult to support the market. As for actual demand, there is hope for large-scale activity. The 80 yuan mark for this month will likely be difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>The RMB standard opened in the previous market session, with the trend of American cotton downward, and selling pressure arose greatly. Each month dropped from 1.2, 5, and 8 jiao to 2.1 yuan.

<p>The cotton market is increasingly declining, with American cotton following the downstream trend. The domestic climate is favorable, and the new cotton production is satisfactory, but the yarn market is weak, and factories have no intention of purchasing. General spot merchants are generally short-selling, but inland yarn factories are still purchasing. The bulls for this month have not yet released, and the future is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

Egyptian cotton saw spot goods fall by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to speculation and liquidation by bulls.

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally quiet and weak in the morning and afternoon sessions. The quotations for foreign wheat, especially Chicago, seemed to have an invisible standstill, while Canadian wheat continued to fall by about 0.6-0.7 jiao. Judging from this situation abroad, the appearance of surplus seems to be gradually revealed. Therefore, after the opening price, the various months remained unfavorable. However, the various factories, due to the substantial profits from short-selling, are all recovering their positions for this month. The main reason is that the spot goods and the standard have diverged. As for the long-term months, short-selling was initially done, but there were not many buyers, making it difficult to dump, so transactions were again sparse. However, from a factual perspective, the future is still a long-term weak and short-term lively situation. As a result, this month was down by 0.05 yuan, September-October down by 0.025 yuan, November down by 0.05 yuan, December down by 0.075 yuan, and January down by 0.0115 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Short Sellers Active, Futures Wheat Unstable <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally weak due to the quotations for foreign wheat. Chicago had an invisible standstill, and it was predicted that it could no longer be raised. Canadian wheat fell by 0.6-0.7 jiao. As for the market situation, due to the sharp decline in the market, the trend of short covering seemed to stabilize, but flour sales remained quiet. The wheat reserves in this area and other ports were still very abundant, so the people's sentiment temporarily tended to firm, and then it became weak. Short sellers were active again in the morning and afternoon, but buyers were limited, so the opening price softened. As a result, all months from this month to January fell by 0.02 yuan. In the spot wheat market, the standard was unstable, and customers were thinking of selling. The various grades continued to shorten by 0.02-0.03-0.04 yuan. Huang Qiao wheat opened at 3.76 yuan, Suqian wheat at 3.67 yuan, Qingjiang wheat at 3.84 yuan, the second grade at 0.79 yuan, Yao Wan wheat at 3.77 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.56 yuan, Gao You wheat at 3.59 yuan, and the second grade at 0.55 yuan, totaling over 7,000 packages, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Saigon Lower Than the Beginning of the Month by a Small Margin of 0.3 Yuan… The Route for Fujian Rice Remains Active</p>
<p>(Guest Xian) The market situation was slightly active yesterday. The Fuzhou brokers were very enthusiastic, actively searching for Du Ke Gao Xian rice in the market. However, the Xiang-Gan rice of the guest Xian type had not arrived for many days, and the low-quality inventory did not meet the brokers' requirements. Later, 500 packages of Wuxi machine-milled Xian were selected, priced at 6.2 yuan, 100 packages of Nanjing machine-milled Xian, priced at 6.1 yuan, and 300 packages of Nanjing brown rice, priced at 5.13 yuan. The middle grade was reduced accordingly, and the market was slightly firmer.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Due to the two sides holding back, the market had not opened for many days. Yesterday, Anli Foreign Firm opened 200 packages of Saigon rice and Xiao Jiao opened 700 packages of returned goods. The price of Saigon No. 1 rice was 7.7 yuan, and the price of Xiao Jiao was 6.85 yuan, both down by a small 0.15 yuan from the previous opening. Saigon has less rice in stock, and the later market may be better than Xiao Jiao. However, the opening price yesterday also fell by a small margin of 0.3 yuan from the selling price on the first of the month. The Xiao Jiao rice priced at 6.85 yuan is still difficult to maintain its position because customers complained that the 700 packages opened by Da Ji have not yet been distributed.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources, and the store positions on this street were still acceptable, but the packed positions had begun to loosen. Fortunately, there were not many incoming goods, and the situation was stable. The market situation for thick-grained Jing, thin-grained Dao, and Du Yang Jian was that fresh and special items were tight, while middle-grade items were generally stable. There was no significant change in prices. Weather-damaged Yuan was lacking in goods and was slightly firm. The Chang Dong Xin remained uneventful.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The fourth and fifth boats of various gangs arrived at the river. The outflow of various goods on the market was normal. The market shape of North Gang White Jing fluctuated slightly, thin Jing was stable, early rice was weak, and Yang Du Jian, Weather-damaged Yuan, and new and old Guest Pu Jian, Dong Xin Jing, etc., were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Continues to Rise by 0.1 Yuan <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten due to the rise in both the gold standard and the import duty. The association drew a line at 21.15 yuan for ordinary grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar and 21.6 yuan for Gao Zhuang KW brand, up by 0.1 yuan from the previous day. The 20-grade medium granulated white sugar P brand was priced at 20.6 yuan, and the Dutch Red KD brand at 16.7 yuan, up by 0.05 yuan. The MKG plus P brand was priced at 16.45 yuan. Chang Xing Firm opened spot goods for RA cotton Dutch white sugar at 20.09 yuan and 25 coarse granulated sugar at 21.15 yuan, with a transshipment tax of 7.95 yuan, with over 1,000 bags transacted. Later, because there was not much coarse granulated sugar in stock on the market, the import duty on the Dutch currency was consistently firm, tightening and unwilling to loosen. Guanghua Factory's production was driven by the Yangtze River market and was unable to keep up with demand, so the various grades also increased in price. The Lu character was priced at 20.07 yuan, the Shou character at 20.03 yuan, the Jin character at 19.9 yuan, the 25 milled sugar plus Guang package at 21.65 yuan, and the September shipment at 21.07 yuan. The medium granulated milled sugar was reduced by 0.55 yuan. Tai Koo Sugar's called price also increased by 0.1 yuan, with the B brand at 21.6 yuan. Ren Ji opened the original Qing Bing flower sugar at 17 yuan for 100 packages. Zhonghua opened 300 packages of No. 1 Bing at 23.7 yuan, up by 0.1 yuan from the previous day. The remaining crystal Bing was priced at 25.7-25.8 yuan, No. 2 Bing at 22.5 yuan, No. 3 Bing at 22.7 yuan, top-grade cotton white at 20.045 yuan, No. 1 at 20.25 yuan, No. 2 at 20.005 yuan, No. 3 at 19.85 yuan, and No. 4 at 19.65 yuan. Guohua goods were priced the same. The Taiyuan ship imported by Jian Gang the previous day arrived with over 1,000 packages of Zhang Diao Qing, which is currently being sampled and priced. If the goods are of high quality, the opening price will definitely rise.</p>
<h3 id="e244">North and South Goods: Candied Dates and Tangerine Peel – One Down, One Up <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of Jiaxing candied dates has fallen, the trend has not yet stabilized. Recently, there has been a continued loosening trend. Yesterday, the market price for bare dates was 30 yuan, which was also very quiet and weak. The trend of 30 yuan is currently in sight. The upstream and downstream grades are discounted as usual.</p>
<p>The arrival of Xiamen tangerine peel has been very scarce recently. Only over 20 pieces arrived on the Tai Koo ship the previous day. Because the cost of arrival was relatively high, the market plate strongly pulled up. It is estimated that about 1 yuan must be added to the previous price to complete the transaction.</p>

<p>Soybean oil sales are dull and stagnant. The market has been weak and has been repeatedly affected by consecutive declines, making the market's sentiment even more depressed. Yesterday, the market was made up by the brokers' purchase of 200 pieces of Qishan basket soybean oil and 200 pieces of sand boat goods. The price opened at 14.9 yuan, down 0.25 yuan from the previous plate.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Autumn Silkworms Are About to Have Abundant Leaves <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>(Zhuji Autumn Silkworms Developing Well) After the silkworm eggs were collected in various cities and towns, they went through well. During the third sleep and wake-up period, they were affected by the hot and humid conditions, resulting in sleep loss and leaf stagnation. Now it has improved, and the large groups have third sleep and abundant leaves. The cocoons can be listed in the market in just over ten days.</p>
<p>(Quantity of Autumn Silkworm Seed Paper in Zhejiang) The Zhejiang Construction Department convened a meeting of directors of 15 sericulture counties and improvement farms on June 15 to develop autumn sericulture, unify silkworm varieties, and decide on implementation methods. The number of silkworm seeds produced and distributed this year was originally scheduled to be 350,000 sheets by the provincial silkworm seed farm, but only 250,000 sheets have been distributed. The seed price is 0.9 yuan per sheet, and it is estimated that it will be paid in two installments due to the economic panic in the rural areas.</p>
<p>(The Price of Rayon is Firm and Stable) The foreign exchange rate has shrunk slightly, and the price of rayon has become more firm. Customer sales have become clearer. Yesterday, only the Hangzhou-Shaoxing gangs purchased eight copies of futures contracts for Da Wu Xi Ya Tu EAK and other brands, a total of 24 boxes, with prices ranging from 170.75 yuan to 158.25 yuan net plate.</p>
<p>(Foreign Silk Market: Chinese and Foreign Wait and See) Yesterday, the local foreign silk market remained unchanged. Although the price of raw silk overseas tended to be firm, it was due to the exchange rate relationship, and actual sales still tended to be sluggish. Yesterday morning, the New York silk dispatch was still unchanged. Both the Chinese and foreign sides remained wait-and-see. Yesterday, only the European firms took advantage of the low prices to cover their short positions, with Jardine Matheson and others purchasing 30 packages of white factory silk and 5 packages of yellow factory silk. The prices remained quiet and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, Ying Zhuang, Tong Fu, Xie He, Tian Yu, and other firms showed strong interest in purchasing high-grade fine tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, and other regions. However, due to the scarcity of inventory in the market and the small number of sources, the market plate was more firm and rose by 3-4 yuan compared to the previous one. The market plate for Zhen Mei green tea saw slightly more vigorous transactions. The market plate for upper and middle-grade goods did not change much. The low-grade and inferior goods were slightly lower. The green tea market trend shows a pattern of raising highs and suppressing lows. As for Qimen black tea, there were only a few thousand boxes in stock. There has been no response to the demand reports from England in recent days, and there were no transactions in the entire city.</p>
<h3 id="e248">General Goods: Plain Serge Sales are Uniquely Strong Among Downstream Grades <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The woolen market has gradually picked up recently. The trading of plain-colored serge has been particularly lively, so the industry calls it a popular product. Now that the weather is getting cooler, sales will increase. However, since the dumping of Japanese goods, domestic goods have been severely hit. Other goods from England, the United States, Germany, and France have also been affected, so prices are difficult to rise. The lower-grade goods priced at over 2 yuan have recently seen large purchases by Japanese customers. Foreign red, bean paste, and lotus gray colors are also being purchased by children's hat factories. The transaction price is only 2.5-2.6 yuan per yard. Furthermore, at the meeting yesterday, 18 yards of Ningfeng Jiyu Dui Jin foreign red serge were transacted, priced at 2.5 yuan, 18 yards of light blue serge, priced at 2.65 yuan, and 12 yards of gray serge, priced at 2.775 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, firewood and charcoal have arrived in a rush at the South Wharf and He Xia, especially Plum Beach firewood, which is the most plentiful, with an estimated 60,000-70,000. The market plate has fallen sharply. It used to sell for 63-64 yuan per foot, but now it sells for 8-9 yuan. Since there are very few buyers, it is estimated that it will have to be cleared out of customs for 10 yuan.</p>

<p>— Lean Gull</p>
<p>In this era, the temptations of material things grow stronger day by day. Humanity's desire for all kinds of enjoyment is also becoming more intense and widespread. As a result, a beautiful vision of the future is piled up before every person who has not yet reached old age, causing them to pray and hope for it all the time. However, this society is now filled with all kinds of deformed developments and ugly darkness, which will make your very legitimate hopes evaporate and completely destroy your determination to strive. As a result: half of the people languish in boredom, and the other half easily become criminals in the eyes of the law. This phenomenon can be seen in the local news columns of various newspapers every day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was sitting in the criminal court of a certain court, and unintentionally, I heard the following noteworthy question and answer.</p>
<p>Judge: You were working well at the ×× Bureau, why did you embezzle public funds?</p>
<p>Criminal: (With a very sad and激昂 attitude) Because I knew there was no hope for my future, I had to use fraudulent means to satisfy my needs.</p>
<p>Judge: What are you talking about? If you can work diligently and do your job well, how can there be no hope?</p>
<p>Criminal: [Diligently work], [Do the job well], Haven't I been doing that for the past fourteen years! Seeing many newcomers who have been promoted through connections, one gets two hundred yuan, and another gets three hundred yuan, but as for me, I still don't even get a hundred! My precious youth has been wasted in this time of being constantly bullied and scolded. If I don't embezzle, what hope is there! (The voice became louder and louder, tears and sweat stuck together.)</p>
<p>Judge: Hmm... (hesitated for a long time) Alright! Embezzling public funds is still a crime, await sentencing! ...</p>
<p>After that, of course, it was several years and several months, but I didn't have the courage to listen anymore. I don't want to make any comments on this matter at all. In fact, I also dare not! However, I remember when I was a child reading about Ji Gong, whenever something unfair happened, he would always arrive gracefully. Moreover, he would often point to the sky and say: [There is a cloud of dark energy there, rushing straight into the sky, there must be something unfair happening, if I don't take care of it, who will! ] Then, he would really rush over and skillfully use his supernatural powers to handle the unfair matter in a fair and just manner, greatly pleasing the people. If Ji Gong really existed as a person, if he really had such supernatural powers, I think it would be impossible for him to live to this day. First, there is too much dark energy in the sky, and there are unfair things everywhere, which one should he take care of first? Maybe he knew in advance that such a day would come, so he extricated himself first.</p>

<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>The sun had just set below the horizon, and electric lights were not yet needed. In the elevator of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, it was filled with people wearing badges all the way up to the ninth floor. These were the people from the five schools of the Shenbao Amateur School who came to participate in the conference.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, a dinner was held. In the cafeteria of the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA, twenty-four tables were arranged around the room. The windows on all sides were open, and the gentle breeze swept over the cups, plates, and chopsticks on the tables, still projecting out of that side of the window: it seemed very refreshing. Waiters in white clothes hurried back and forth, and after a while, the signing area became crowded. One by one, people's heads moved towards each seat: Several people standing at the door kept uttering words of welcome, while at the same time every gaze was cast upon the badge of the person coming in. The students of the Second School stuffed their school publication | Dusk Clock | into the hands of every student.</p>
<p>Everyone sat down, and Principal Shi Liangcai sat at the table in the middle, smiling as he looked at his many students. The white-clad waiters began to busy themselves, sending dishes one by one to each table, but it was very slow, so Vice Principal Li Gongpu stood up and said to the many students in a humorous tone: "The dishes are coming too slowly, students, you can eat a little slower, don't eat too full and not be able to eat the dishes later." The students all laughed. The cafeteria was filled with what Principal Shi called [Sweet Air].</p>
<p>The conference opened,</p>
<p>The chairman, the principal, the dean, and the student representatives successively made many brilliant speeches, sincere, genuine, and affectionate, striking into the hearts of every student, and thunderous applause filled the space of the meeting place. It showed that the meaning of this conference was very great.</p>
<p>The chairman announced the start of the entertainment, and happiness ran onto the faces of the students again, replacing the solemnity. Then Mr. Mang Daling's story jokes, Vice Principal Li's Hawaiian guitar solo, the Shenbao newspaper's martial arts performance, and the movie "Mad Current" screened by the Mingxing Film Company, one item after another, one scene after another, the music vibrated the eardrums, and the performances anesthetized the soul, until the road back home, full of: joy, encouragement, gratitude, understanding.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Preserving the Status Quo <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Ying</p>
<p>In the era of imperial autocracy, as commoners, under the [Vast Imperial Grace], we cautiously behaved as obedient citizens, living in peace and working happily, following the rules and regulations. We should not have wild ideas and do things that our predecessors had never done; even less were we allowed to be unconventional and establish our own unique style. Otherwise, it would be too restless and irresponsible, and we would be labeled as [Reactionary Elements].</p>
<p>Therefore, under such pressure, as commoners, we could only preserve the businesses already established by our predecessors and do things that others had already done.</p>
<p>Now, let's take an example, using the signboard of a store to illustrate:</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Hangzhou knows that Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors are famous both at home and abroad. If we plan to buy a few pairs of scissors to give to friends, the difficulty arises; almost every street has one or two Zhang Xiaoquan scissors stores. Specially marked [Inherited for over two hundred years], [Only this one, no branches], which makes us confused. It is said that something with the word [Ji] is genuine. Upon closer inspection, [Near Ji], [Far Ji], [Da Ji], [Shu Ji], are all smoke and mirrors, all words with similar shapes.</p>
<p>There are also such things in Shanghai. The cooked meat store is always Lu Gaojian, and they are all marked with [Genuine] and [Old].</p>
<p>Others have worked hard to manage and finally have a store signboard with a [Good Reputation], and you effortlessly steal it and claim it as your own. I think this was tacitly approved by the government in the era of imperial autocracy.</p>
<p>If the imperial system continues, then the stores selling anything will have a uniform signboard, which would be a [Unified] and [Unique] thing.</p>
<p>The [Preservation of the Status Quo] from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods for two thousand years has created the current poor and backward Chinese nation!</p>
<h3 id="e256">Summer Heat Avoidance in Iron Bars <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>Old classmate Mr. Li was arrested in the 19th year of the Republic of China due to political reasons and was imprisoned. He only regained his freedom at the beginning of this month. Yesterday, I met him in the park. Mr. Li said: [After spending three summers in prison, I never sweated profusely once. This summer, I just got out of prison and immediately felt the heat pressing down on me, which was uncomfortable. It can be seen that the ancient saying "A calm mind naturally brings coolness" is indeed true, because once you become a prisoner, you must be isolated from the outside world, and all thoughts are calmed down, and the state of mind is naturally peaceful.]</p>
<p>After hearing this, I couldn't help but marvel [Looking at it this way, we poor people don't have the qualifications to go to Lushan or Mogan Mountain, so it's better to go into iron bars to avoid the summer heat, which is also very economical. We don't even have to pay for room and board, wouldn't that be extremely cheap? ] I said this, and Mr. Li laughed.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Li showed me a [Prison Diary] and showed me a [Song of the Prisoner]. After reading it, I felt cool all over, so I named it [Song of Coolness], and with Mr. Li's consent, I recorded it for the readers of this publication, as a small cup of ice cream.</p>
<p>I will always be with this quiet iron window,</p>
<p>I hope my state of mind will always be like clear still water!</p>
<p>Every day, besides leisurely eating and sleeping, I enjoy the swaying green branches and leaves outside the window!</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>I will always be with this quiet iron window, I hope my eyes will always be like pure white crystal!</p>
<p>Unstained by all the dirt in the world, always happily singing to the white clouds!</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>I will always be with this quiet iron window, I hope my conscience will always be warm and safe, and all troubles will not approach me. The flowers outside the window always give me a secluded fragrance!</p>

<p>Guan Yaowu threw away the cigarette in his hand, scratched his head and smiled: Auntie, what exactly do you mean? Lao Zhao is a very good person, but because he is a soldier, he can't give your daughter to him. But he said that he is willing to give up his military life to seek a marriage alliance, but you say you don't dare to! What kind of opinion is this after all? Ms. Jiang frowned and said: That's exactly what I'm struggling with. Guan Yaowu said: What does my cousin mean? Ms. Jiang said: Looking at her appearance, she seems willing. Guan Yaowu said: I think, let's do it this way, the marriage is settled. You think soldiers are not good, and in the future, when everyone becomes relatives, you can discuss whether to let him do it or not. Ms. Jiang hesitated for a long time before nodding and said: Only by doing this will it be more thoughtful. Although we thought that being a soldier would mean not being able to take care of the family, we also thought that Old Master Zhao and Company Commander Zhao are both gentlemen, and we couldn't bear to abandon this marriage. Thinking about it, we really couldn't make a decision. Guan Yaowu smiled and said: That's what I just said, the most appropriate. Ms. Jiang still seemed to feel some difficulty. She also took a teacup, poured a cup of tea, sat on the edge of the kang, and slowly drank it. Guan Yaowu saw her situation and was afraid of pushing her too hard and making things stiff, so he stared blankly at Ms. Jiang, unable to say anything more. Thus, at a time when the problem urgently needed to be resolved, the room became silent. Suddenly, the wind door in the outer room rang, and someone shouted: Mom, should we make dinner? It was Guizhi who had returned. Ms. Jiang said: You just had lunch a while ago, and now you want to make dinner again. This child must be confused about living: Cousin Guan is here. Guan Yaowu thought that after hearing this, she would definitely not come into the inner room, but Guizhi was very generous and came in with a smile and said, Cousin, my mother mentioned this morning that you would definitely come, and you really came.

<h3 id="e258">A Glimpse of Yuan Hanyun in Pinghu <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Yuan Hanyun of Huan Shang occupies a considerable position in modern literary history. In terms of his family background, he is very similar to Chen Siwang Zhi, but his elder brother Ke Ding is not as good as Emperor Wen Pi. This is just my casual analogy, because when it comes to Yuan Hanyun, people inevitably think of Yuan Xiangcheng and his Hongxian episode. It just so happens that Wei Wu had a son who monopolized eight dou of talent. Hanyun is a bit like that, so I wrote this analogy. In fact, we don't want to dwell on the old accounts of Hongxian; we only feel that Hanyun's death is a very regrettable thing in the Chinese literary world, making people miss him endlessly! Therefore, we feel that the anecdotes of his life are even more precious. Below is a glimpse of him in Pinghu.</p>
<p>He went to Pinghu, I don't know what for. At that time, Xiangcheng had failed to become emperor and was still the president. The people of the whole country had negative feelings towards Xiangcheng. He went there by ordinary boat. In fact, Hanyun's personality was completely different from Ke Ding's. Hanyun fundamentally opposed Xiangcheng's claim to the throne and even bitterly admonished him in person; Xiangcheng didn't care much, but Ke Ding's enthusiasm for becoming the crown prince was even greater than Xiangcheng's, leading to the later results. Even if Hanyun went to Pinghu when the whole country admired Xiangcheng in the second year of the Republic of China, or even after the imperial system was actually successful, he would definitely not publicize it and take an ordinary boat. Therefore, at that time, he didn't necessarily go there quietly and secretly because the people opposed Xiangcheng. That was his magnanimity.</p>
<p>However, the local Pinghu Daily actually knew about it and specially published a special issue to report the news of [President Yuan's son Ke Wen arriving in the county], which stirred up the hearts of the people in the whole city. Everyone rushed to Donghu to see the boat Hanyun was on and catch a glimpse of the president's son's face. Who knew that they didn't see the son but saw the foolish state of his concubine's uncle, which attracted everyone's attention and made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>This so-called concubine's uncle was Tang Zhijun's younger brother. Zhijun was from Pinghu, and his father was a fruit vendor. The younger brother was still young and usually didn't wear long clothes. Hearing that Hanyun had arrived, he also knew in his childish consciousness that he had to go to greet him and couldn't go without wearing long clothes, so he borrowed a set of robes and jackets from someone and rushed to Donghu. Since he wasn't used to wearing long clothes and the set of robes and jackets were borrowed and didn't fit well, it was naturally inevitable that he would make people laugh.</p>
<p>Generally, all women have vanity! According to Hanyun's idea, he would spend the night on the boat to avoid a lot of trouble; Tang Zhijun insisted that Hanyun go ashore and go to his house for a while, thinking it was a great honor. Hanyun loved Zhijun very much and couldn't bear to go against his wishes, so he had to go ashore. But they couldn't live in his house, so they temporarily rented a house from someone. As soon as they sat down, a large group of people gathered outside the door. There were also many antique dealers who knew Hanyun's hobby and brought antiques one after another, seeing it as an opportunity to make a fortune. Even those who sold opium also came to the door to solicit sales, coming and going in an endless stream. The owner of the house knew that Hanyun wouldn't stay long and thought that if it went on for a long time, it would be terrible, and the threshold would be squeezed through; but it was inconvenient to say it to Hanyun directly, so he asked Hanyun's servant to express that he had a limited time to move out. The servant told Hanyun. Hanyun was very unhappy and immediately moved the whole family back to the boat. But he never said a word to the owner of the house.</p>
<p>After moving back to the boat, Zhijun again encouraged him to set off foreign fireworks, his idea being nothing more than to show off his wealth. Hanyun loved him and couldn't refuse, so he prepared. As soon as the news spread, many people came to watch. At that time, it happened to be under martial law, and County Magistrate Zhu Fubao sent someone to politely stop him. Hanyun immediately agreed. Zhijun and his mother were determined not to give up and still urged the workers to build a stage. Zhu Fubao was also a strong and upright official, and mistakenly thought that Hanyun refused to stop, so he immediately ordered twenty-four policemen to go to dismantle the stage; and gave a handwritten order: if there is any obstruction, no matter who it is, arrest them and report back. Zhijun and his mother had no choice but to stop, weeping and telling Hanyun. Hanyun was also angry and sent a telegram to Zhejiang Governor Lu Yongxiang. After the telegram was sent, Hanyun seemed to have forgotten about it. Without waiting for Lu Yongxiang's reply, he set sail and left Pinghu.</p>

<h3 id="e259">From Martial Arts Novels to Humorous Essays <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>Some time ago, martial arts novels were very popular. Their power was great. Some young apprentices in stores were fascinated by them and went to Mount Emei to cultivate themselves. The supernatural elements in martial arts novels are the pinnacle of martial arts, so those who try to obtain the highest martial arts always want to find immortals. The failure of martial arts novels lies in this, because immortals are not easy to find in the world, and their架空 always show flaws from time to time. Once they come into contact with real society, they cannot survive.</p>
<p>But martial arts works did indeed capture the hearts of the public for a while. Just looking at the number of types of books published and the畅销, you can know. Moreover, the film industry, which is good at speculation, has also produced a lot of martial arts and supernatural films for this reason, which can be taken as clear evidence. Moreover, the popularity of martial arts novels also has its inevitable reasons, that is, the public is thirsty for the appearance of this kind of warriors and heroes, even if they just look at it in books, they feel happy in their hearts.</p>
<p>When most people in society feel depressed, want to complain, and hope that someone will stand up for them, it is the era when heroes should appear. If real heroes cannot be produced, heroes in books will also be welcomed. In order to make the mind temporarily comfortable, people are willing to regard what is described in books as true. And modern China is exactly the time to demand heroes. Our soldiers can't beat Japanese soldiers, so we hope that a foreign country will stand up for us, that is, we hope for the appearance of heroes. We want to use broadswords and spears to fight against airplanes and cannons, just like hoping that there are flying swords and flying knives that can kill people in the air, that is, hoping that there are immortal methods that can win. But once it comes into contact with reality, there are obvious facts, so martial arts novels fail. Shanghai must sign a ceasefire agreement, and Beijing must also sign a ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>At this time, a kind of humorous essay publication was produced. In less than a year, this kind of publication sprang up like mushrooms. It is not right to say that the status of martial arts novels has been replaced by this school of essays, but it is a fact that it has succeeded in becoming a popular hit. Most of these essays do not speak from the front, but take the method of attacking from the side, using metaphors and 暗讽 to express their feelings and vent their grievances. And the voice is also very weak, like a sob, not a loud cry.</p>
<p>Isn't this transformation from using broadswords to fight against cannons to 含诟忍辱 signing a ceasefire agreement? Since heroes cannot appear and immortal methods are not successful, then for the injustices in this society, there is only sobbing and resentment. This is the reason why humorous essays are popular after martial arts novels.</p>
<p>But will this slight sobbing and resentment have any effect? No one can be sure. Just like signing a ceasefire agreement is not a solution, it is necessary to wait for the second step of means. Let's see what will rise after humorous essays? Is it roar or surrender? Not only can the trend of society be seen from there, but also the future of China can be predicted from this.</p>

<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Recently, I read Jia Yin Weekly and saw an article by Mr. Gu Tong, mentioning Chen Zhongfu. It roughly said that Zhongfu's original name was Gansheng, and his name was Zhong. He was from an old family in Huaining. He was known for his studies in his early years. He spoke sharply and liked to make judgments. He was impatient and intolerant of others, and was often not tolerated by others. He was unsuccessful in his travels to the East, and returned to Shanghai to establish National Daily with Yu (Gu Tong refers to himself), Cangzhou Zhang Puquan, and Nankang Xie Xiaoshi. The two of us热居 in the partial building of Changshou Lane, in charge of writing辞笔, without leaving our house. Our living habits were irregular. We didn't wash our faces, and our clothes were worn out and could not be changed, nor were they washed. One morning, Yu saw white things星星 on his black 衵衣, countless in number. Yu was shocked and said, Zhongfu, what is this? Zhongfu looked at himself slowly and replied calmly, Lice. His asceticism was like this. This is the connection between modern literati and lice. Gu Tong calls it asceticism, but Zhongfu regards it as 平平 and may not think it is苦. The Biography of Wang Meng in the Book of Jin says that his气度 was雄远 and petty matters did not interfere with his thoughts. When Huan Wen entered the customs, Meng, wearing coarse clothes, went to see him. He talked about current affairs on the one hand, and held the lice and spoke on the other hand, as if there was no one else. Wen察 and was surprised by him. Huan Wen regarded the presence of lice on a豪傑, but for Wang Meng, lice were trivial matters and he may not have thought they were strange. The Literary Biography in the Book of Southern Qi says that Bian Bin's talent was extraordinary, he liked to drink alcohol, and abandoned his appearance. He once wrote a "Ode to Fleas and Lice", with a preface saying, "I am poor, and I have not made cloth clothes for ten years. A robe of 縕 is what I rely on for life, using it to资其寒暑, and I have nothing to replace it with. I am often sick, and my lifestyle is very疏. My 寝 is worn out and cannot be released. I am also lazy and slack, and lazy to take care of my skin. I am not careful in澡刷 and I lose time in 澣沐. Four seasons 㲰㲰, and on top of that, it is臭穢. Therefore, between the reed mat and the蓬缨, fleas and lice 猥流,淫痒渭濩, and I can't forgive my flesh at any time. I探揣擭撮 every day. Lice have a saying, 朝生暮孙. As for my lice, there is no worry about汤沐, and there is no sorrow about相弟. They宴聚 in the long jacket of 久襟烂布, and the clothes do not change, and 搯齧 cannot be added. I am脱略缓懒, and I am not diligent in捕讨. The 孙孙息息 have been around for thirty-five years." I think Bian Bin could not forget the lice, and his 擯弃形骸 was still not enough. He often worried about poverty and illness, and he had no far-reaching ambitions. It is said that Wang Jinggong once entered the court with Wang Yuyu. A louse climbed from Jinggong's collar to his beard, which happened to be seen by the emperor, who couldn't help but laugh. When he退朝, Jinggong asked Yuyu, "Why did the emperor laugh?" Yuyu said, "The emperor saw lice on 相公's beard." Jinggong immediately ordered his followers to remove the lice. Yuyu said, "It cannot be easily removed. I would like to赞 a word." Jinggong said, "What do you赞?" Yuyu赞 said, "It has traveled相's beard many times and has been御覧. It cannot be killed, or perhaps it should be放焉." Colleagues heard it and laughed. Jinggong was a scholar with宏抱, and he was committed to those who violated him greatly. As for囚首丧面, he did not have time to 澣洗. It is appropriate that he was connected to lice.</p>

<p>— You Guang</p>
<p>Autumn has already arrived, and the heat is no less than in summer. When the electric lights replaced the sun, I was still wandering on the road.</p>
<p>Dangerous? Danger makes people nervous, and坚张 makes people feel the strength of their own lives. Wandering in danger is very good.</p>
<p>There are still leisurely places in the concession, which are residential areas. But the residences of middle-class Chinese are hot, with eating stalls, 胡琴, 麻将,留声机, garbage cans, and bare bodies and legs. What is suitable is the outside of the residences of upper-class Chinese or 等洋人, wide roads,碧绿 trees,淡色 window幔, cool air, and moonlight, but there are also狗子 calling.</p>
<p>I grew up in the countryside and love to hear狗子 calling. At night, the distant bark is pleasant to hear. The ancients called [Dog sounds like leopards]. If you accidentally pass a strange village, a crazy吼叫 and 巨奦 jump out, it also gives people a kind of tension, as if facing a battle, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, what I hear here is a叭儿狗. It躱躱闪闪 and calls very脆: 汪汪.</p>
<p>I don't like to hear this kind of calling.</p>
<p>I walked around and smiled coldly, because I understood that the way to shut it up was to say a few words to the管门人 of its master, or to throw it a bone. I can do both of these, but I don't.</p>
<p>It often wants to汪汪.</p>
<p>I don't like to hear this kind of calling.</p>
<p>I walked around and smiled evilly, because I had a pebble in my hand. As soon as the evil smile ended, I raised my hand and threw it, hitting it right on the bridge of its nose.</p>
<p>With a呜 sound, it disappeared. I walked, walked, in the rare silence.</p>
<p>Autumn has already arrived, and I am still walking. Calling is still there, but it is even more躱躱闪闪, the sound is also different from before, and the distance is also far away, and even the nose cannot be seen.</p>
<p>I no longer laugh coldly, no longer laugh evilly, I walk, listening comfortably to its very脆 sound.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Spring Warmth <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Daoyan</p>
<p>Ever since the several crop failures and last year's low grain prices, A Mao had grown fearful of farming. Especially as harvest time approached, A Mao's heart was filled with anxiety. Because on normal days the creditors weren't too pressing, but once harvest time arrived, they would find an excuse to urgently demand money from him.</p>
<p>Although he was anxious, he still held hope. Like this year's spring, seeing the green wheat seedlings in the fields, his heart always felt a nameless joy. By early April, the wheat ears were heavily laden and abundant. A gentle breeze swept by, causing them to sway as if about to fall. Seeing this, A Mao often muttered to himself as if making a vow: [This year's wheat won't be as cheap as last year's rice... I don't believe it, surely they won't deliberately make things difficult for us farmers.]</p>
<p>Harboring this hope, his former courage returned somewhat. He calculated inwardly: if this year's wheat price could be the same as last year's, selling at five dollars and forty cents per shi (a unit of dry measure), then sixteen mu (a unit of area) of land, assuming one shi per mu, sixteen shi would fetch more than eighty dollars. Although he couldn't completely pay off his old debts, he could at least repay some of the pressing debts, and there would also be some provisions for the family's consumption in the months to come. Thinking of this, a faint smile hung on his dark red lips.</p>
<p>Towards the end of April, A Mao was vigorously cutting wheat in the field. He bent his left knee, stretched his right leg back, arched his waist, hunched his back, held a handful of wheat stalks in his left hand, and held a sickle in his right hand. The sickle went to work on the wheat and moved back and forth along with the movements of his feet. The spring weather was erratic, but the sweat on A Mao's body dripped down like a network of threads, and his blue cloth shirt and pants were completely soaked.</p>
<p>After three full days of effort, A Mao and his wife had completely cut and threshed the wheat in the field. They harvested a total of more than sixteen shi. On the fourth morning, A Mao took someone else's dilapidated boat to the town to sell the wheat.</p>
<p>The boat stopped at the riverbank of a rice shop. A Mao walked into the rice shop to ask about the wheat price.</p>
<p>[Wheat is two dollars and eighty cents,] the shop assistant at the counter replied listlessly.</p>
<p>[What! How could it have dropped so much! Last year it sold for five dollars and forty cents!] Hearing these words, A Mao's beautiful hopes burst like soap bubbles.</p>
<p>[Look at how much wheat is on the market now. The current price is still good. When the large shipments of foreign wheat arrive next month, the wheat price will probably drop even further!]</p>
<p>A Mao felt a sting of pain selling at such a low price because the fertilizer costs alone amounted to one dollar per mu. But what could he do if he didn't sell? They still had to eat, and the debts had to be paid. Even if he waited a few more days, judging by the shop assistant's tone, there was no hope of the price rising. In the end, A Mao's wheat was moved into the rice shop's warehouse, and he received a sum of cash that was far different from his original budget.</p>
<p>Walking out of the shop, A Mao looked at the silver coins in his hand and said to himself as if muttering: [They really are deliberately making things difficult for us farmers!]</p>
<p>However, who exactly were the ["they"] in A Mao's mouth?</p>

<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Lu Xian one day found a self-bound collection of poems in a park. Its appearance and content were both very lovely. The next day she mailed it back to the loser at the address on a letter clipped to the book. After sending it off, she received only a short thank-you note, which made her somewhat dissatisfied, so she wrote another letter. But there was no reply. She couldn't help but be angered by the other party's arrogance. Angered, she couldn't help but write again and again, and she wrote four or five more letters in that way. After consistently not receiving a reply, one day she personally went to see the recipient. She saw him, in front of his door, but at first he denied that he was who he was, but then he admitted it and asked for her forgiveness. She felt the joy of victory, because his arrogance—she thought it was his arrogance—had really caused her too much grievance, so she repaid him with a mocking letter to end that curious romance.</p>
<p>However, Si Bin, the recipient, was not a person who would let his emotions rise and fall with other people's emotions. What he needed, he just needed, regardless of whether the person being needed had the same need, and Lu Xian was what he needed. So that letter of farewell could not stop his progress. He decided to write back. In that reply, he told her how he hadn't read her previous letters, and when he saw them, how he fell in love with her curiosity, coquetry, provocation, playfulness, and animosity; and when he saw her, how he fell in love with her hair, eyes, lips, chest, and calves.</p>
<p>By the time the letter was written, the sky was already beginning to lighten. He wanted to send it to her in person; because it was too early, he lay down on the bed and waited. But as soon as he lay down, he fell into a drowsy sleep, and when he woke up, it was already after twelve o'clock. He knew that she taught at someone's house from two to four o'clock, and he thought he might as well wait for her to return from teaching before going. So he walked to the first act setting of the drama in progress—the park where he had lost his collection of poems.</p>
<p>Once seated, he took out the letter and reread it. As he read, he felt that the letter was a bit shabby. Therefore, he eliminated his intention to hand it over in person; and if he handed it over in person, it would be embarrassing if she didn't read it, and it would be even more awkward if she did. But he still kept wanting to go see her. He looked at the big clock and it was only just past two o'clock. Two more hours! He stood up and ran around in the park. He was also imagining where his collection of poems had been lost. He was also wondering if her personality wasn't as beautiful as described in her letters! It couldn't be unlike, because affectation couldn't be so skillful; and even if it was affectation, wouldn't that affectation be very cute? Would she think he was going to see her? She would, he believed, because she herself was such an unyielding person; perhaps not going would disappoint and anger her.</p>
<p>Just as Si Bin imagined, Lu Xian, after sending out that last letter, was timidly hoping for his reply, or even his arrival. She felt that the letter had been sent out too rashly. His previous failure to reply always had his reasons, and she should give him a chance to explain and not just be willful in seeking temporary satisfaction. And this matter was created by herself, not by the other party's initiative. And, although at first there was only spite, now she seemed to feel a kind of indescribable affection spreading in her heart. She wanted to write another letter, but her pride wouldn't allow it. Therefore, for the past two days, she had been very lazy and had not gone to her lessons.</p>
<p>As soon as it was four o'clock, Si Bin left the park for Lu Xian's residence. At that time, Lu Xian was playing with a cohabiting child in the parlor. When she heard the unfamiliar knock on the door, she personally went to open the door.</p>
<p>[Oh, it's you! Oh, Mr. Si Bin.]</p>
<p>[Thank you, Miss Lu Xian. May I come in?]</p>
<p>[Please come in,] she paused and said, because she felt that the question was not easy to answer.</p>
<p>[You, Mr. Si Bin, you received my letter, I mean that...] Walking into the parlor, Lu Xian asked.</p>
<p>[You won't let me see the letter about you? I already received it, but you are really too stingy, Miss Lu Xian.]</p>
<p>[Because you are so generous, you can...] The ellipsis is a smile. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e264">About Hiring a Wet Nurse <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>At the One-Month Celebration Feast</p>
<p>These are the opinions of guests at the Wang residence's one-month celebration feast regarding hiring a wet nurse.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Wang smilingly brought out her firstborn young master, everyone naturally praised him with admiring words like "So fair and tender, so cute." Mrs. Wang then sat on the host's seat, below Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>[Is your milk supply good?] Old Man Chen, with a handful of long whiskers on his chin, was the first to ask Mrs. Wang. Mrs. Wang blushed red, bit her lip, and did not answer Old Man Chen, only glancing at Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang readily said:</p>
<p>[We hired a wet nurse. Our own milk has not yet been given to the child.]</p>
<p>[This is not very good. If the child only drinks the wet nurse's milk, the child's personality will be like the wet nurse's when he grows up,] Old Man Chen said, feeling the issue of racial constitution, expressing his disapproval.</p>
<p>[Unbuttoning clothes to breastfeed the child is quite embarrassing...] Mrs. Wang explained bashfully. [I often heard my classmates say before that using one's own milk to feed the child is very easy to destroy one's youth.]</p>
<p>[This makes a lot of sense.] Most of the guests expressed their sympathy, including Mr. Wang. Only Old Man Chen put his left arm on the back of the chair, looked up, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, his right hand constantly stroking his beard, looking as if he was very sentimental.</p>
<p>[Actually, these are all irrelevant. Having money can certainly hire a wet nurse to [help out], and it is said that it can also maintain the beauty of the mother's youth; but we should also consider at the same time: the wet nurse absolutely does not have milk to sell if she does not have children herself. In such a matter, we can clearly see: the wet nurse sells her milk and starves her own child's stomach; then, the rich buy the wet nurse's milk, which is equivalent to taking, robbing, and plundering the wet nurse's child's food, and this little life is in danger of starving to death and being destroyed!...] My words welled up to my throat several times, but were always swallowed down into my stomach by the big fish and meat.</p>
<h3 id="e265">I Deceived Her! <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>[Second Miss, I should always find a way to find a way to make a living,] the maid from the Wu family next door said to me:</p>
<p>[Yes, Ah Chen, your mistress is really too harsh on you today,] I replied to him with great sympathy and pity.</p>
<p>Seeing my sympathy, he continued:</p>
<p>[Second Miss, look, today I accidentally broke a bowl, and she scolded me [White Tiger] [Troublemaker], told me to get out, and said that with money, it's not hard to find a clumsy maid like me...]</p>
<p>[Alas! Ah Chen, earning money is indeed too difficult. Now you really have no other way but to work as a maid for others; for the sake of money, I think you should endure it and keep working!]</p>
<p>Ah Chen still looked mournful, so I said again:</p>
<p>[You need to know that it's difficult to work for people everywhere!]</p>
<p>[Second Miss, your family's Ah Si is also a maid like me. When he makes a small mistake, you don't scold him at all. I...] He sobbed and cried.</p>
<p>[Ah Chen, I would also be happy for you to come to my house to work, but... but Ah Si doesn't have any bad habits, how can we dismiss him?]</p>
<p>I said hesitatingly, not wanting to disappoint him:</p>
<p>[Think about it, Second Miss, they simply treat me like a thief, locking the doors in and out; when I break something, they even scold me for things from previous years, shouting [Get out] again and again, alas, how can I live this kind of life?] His tears welled up like a spring.</p>
<p>[Ah Chen, slowly wait, wait for the arrival of opportunity,] I said to him very cleverly: [Ah Chen, suffer a little bit, suffer for ten or eight years, accumulate some money, and then you will be out of your misery.]</p>
<p>[Ah Chen, Ah Chen,] a voice from outside came in, which was clearly the voice of his mistress.</p>
<p>Ah Chen wiped his tears and ran back in a hurry. I stared blankly at his retreating figure; I thought, I have been clever again, I deceived her!</p>
<h3 id="e266">Street Night Scene <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Guanying</p>
<p>Night enveloped the earth, and New Year's lanterns were already flickering in the streets. The fiery atmosphere of the daytime had long been blown by the evening breeze to the ends of the earth. People in the summer, except for the working class, mostly were accustomed to resting during the day and coming out at night. At this moment, as the night was just beginning, it was precisely when they began to be active. The night of the city was originally full of mystery, and the romance of the imperial daughters in a corner of Hongkou added a bit of spring color. Under the dim lights, small groups of wooden clogs-wearing women, heavily made up, leaned against doors, smiling and selling their charms to people. No matter how grand the imperial ambition was, it could not cover the shame and sorrow deep in the hearts of the daughters.</p>
<p>Groups of three or five European sailors constantly came to this mysterious corner to pursue pleasure. The mingling of foreign emotions stirred a deep feeling in my heart. Cinemas, dance halls... were the places where they pursued pleasure and roamed about. The temptation of flesh, the allure of colors, the ancient costumes of large kimonos, wrapped around slender figures, no matter how heroic Western nations were, they could not resist their soft and charming teasing. So they embraced, danced, and in their crimson lips, Eastern and Western cultures were exchanged.</p>
<p>Short, waddling imperial warriors walked in groups on the streets. The sound of leather shoes, accompanied by arrogant expressions and high spirits, moved forward. I could not help but recall the events of January 28th and express a gnashing of teeth and angry gaze at them.</p>
<p>Next door was a Tokyo hotel. The New Year's lanterns outside reflected the pale green lights on the upper floor. Amidst the leisurely music and dance, the imperial daughters' songs also rose up, only stopping when the night was deep and quiet.</p>
<p>Ugh! Bang! An ambulance drove from afar and stopped next to a hospital across the street. Was it suicide? Revenge killing? A car accident? The lives of city people were so uncertain!</p>
