<p>戰爭之前程</p>
<p>（一）國際聯盟盟約第十六條之引用</p>
<p>日本軍國主義者自蹂躪滿洲製造僞國以。來即借口特殊關係。蓄意挑戰。在其行爲上之表現。固非獨占遠東經濟的市塲已也。是以十九委員會。亦難再事隱忍。一任日本之撕毁國際間一切公約。蔑棄［信義］而以武力支配世界也。十九委員會所提草案。雖未必邓照原案通過。但日本帝國主義者之暴力侵略。從此爲全世界所公認。我國身受其害。如能及時奮力自救則國聯盟約第十六條之裁制丨經濟封鎖日本。丨亦不難實現。</p>
<p>彼國有識者早懷戒心。即狂大自誇如大阪朝日新聞。亦且瞭解日本陷於外交孤立。亦知徒令［全國化爲土］之爲愚策也故主張［避免］［戰爭］愼重將事。］然而吾人審知一年半以來。日本之輿論。完全爲軍國主義思想所支配。試觀本月二十二日日本海軍部非公式表示之意見。　　［退出國聯爲豫期之事實。……萬一有人敢行經濟封鎖。……我（日本）］海軍準備以實力加以膺懲。……］</p>
<p>［……南洋羣島之委任統治。有敢於否認（日本）帝國之嚴然主權者必加以斷然的排擊。賭其死活。必令南洋羣島（日本）海上生命線。不離日本之手［……熱河問題爲滿洲國内之問題。……］</p>
<p>此種聲明。匪特荒謬絕倫。直是向世界挑戰矣。國際聯盟是否勉强忍受即不忍受而提出抗議。亦未必能得日方圓滿合理之答覆。惟我國處此生死關頭。已萬不能偷安旦夕。尤不能希望外力之援助。在敵兵壓境之援助在敵兵壓境之時又豈能憑過去條約爲講理之依據。</p>
<p>勢已至此。第一。惟有發動整個的民族鬥。爭拚四萬萬人之赤血與暴敵周旋。第二。熱河之爲平津屏障。北門鎖鑰。勿待詳論。今者敵方乃欲假借僞名憑熱河而蠶食華北。我爲國家前途計。爲民族生存計。爲將來收復東北三省失地計。均當拚全國之力。保持熱河。敵來固當迎頭加以痛擊。敵來固當迎頭加以痛擊。敵去尤必極力窮追復我故土。第三。抵抗之舉。我乃處於客位。敵不來攻。我即處於頽勢。今後必須旋轉乾坤。乘此全國奮發之際。轉抵抗爲反攻。展開收回東北失地之戰線。正式出兵討伐僞國。挑起戰爭序幕。以實力懲治日本帝國主義之暴行。（二）自衞戰爭</p>
<p>國聯十九委員會草案提出後。日軍在滿行動之爲侵略。已爲世界所共同確認。然日軍仍繼續侵略不已。我此時雖已獲［道德上勝利。］苟無實力爲之後盾。終屬徒然。矧國際之公理。尤須視。實力何如。而定公理是否得伸之準據。是故吾人於此。［講理］已告一叚落。尤當轉換方式。立起以武力奮鬭。　　我國積弱已非一日。敵方固欺我不敢言戰。乃處處使用威脅手段。運用少數兵力。而收獲最大效果。蓋我加如奮力一戰。則日本國内所伏之危機。亦將一　一爆發。我爲自衛。不得已而發動（戰爭。）對内足以清滅一切自身之矛盾。奮發頽廢之精神。團結渙散不齊之行動。出巨大之犧牲。挽回我民族頽運。對外列國須視我實力奮戰之結果。方能棄其往昔輕蔑之觀念。傾聽我國所主張之［正義。］而收回東北失地。維護世界和平正義。尤非我出重大之鐵血代價。决無實現之可能。</p>
<p>尤有進者。一旦對日戰爭開始。全國各地當然入於戰時狀態。遠東市塲之情形。亦可想見。英美蘇法。各國至此。雖欲袖手坐觀中日戰爭而不可得。國聯盟約第十六條之裁制。此其時矣。故日方有識者。亦擬避免戰爭。一發。盟約第十六條。繼起而加以經濟裁制。日將感受與歐戰中之德國。同一困境。今其海軍部雖故作驚人之語。以實力恐嚇列强。并以脅制我國。然其外强中乾。已爲公開之秘密。豈能掩飾哉。</p>
<p>我國失地逾三百八十萬方里。雪恥復仇豈同侵略。况我堅持奮戰。則裁制暴力之權。操諸我國之手。啓發世界和平。亦將視我國能否以鐵血擊破日本軍國主義之迷夢爲斷也。</p>

<p>倘對中日一律施禁</p>
<p>不啻助長日本黷武</p>
<p>英國不作單獨行動擬與國際合作</p>
<p>（南京）　今晨中國某發言人評論各國現議禁止運輸軍火供給遠東相爭之國事、謂中國政府固贊成禁止之原則、但此種原則不能施於中日爭案、日本現爲侵略國、中國則純屬自衛、加以日本軍火早已備足、而中國則並未備戰、如禁止軍火出口、對中日一律實行、則列强不啻輔助日本在華之侵略云、（二十三日路透社電）　　（倫敦）　英政府現正研究以國際行動禁止軍火運往遠東之可能性、此事在法英意三國手續殊爲簡單、祇須拒發出口護照即可、而在美國及其他各國、則不若如此易易、内閣今夜曾贊成對禁止問題應取之步驟、並提出此後行動之建議、但又議决英國不能單獨行動、而必須與其他輸出軍火各國合同辦理、今日下院集議時、前閣員薩繆爾聲明渠將於二月二十七日質問政府曾否與其他列强及自治地商榷對以軍火供給國聯所斥爲妄用武力之任何作戰國、一律施禁云、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　關於禁止以軍火運往遠東問題、有人以英政府之態度、詢問政界人物、據答稱、此事應由國聯會决定、且須先行判定何方爲侵略者、國聯會對於此層、旣無所决定、則軍火之運送、如欲加以禁止、必須對交戰國雙方同時行之、但日本有製造軍火之工廠、而中國無之、在如此情形之下、則禁止運送軍火之結果、必將與一般人所希望者相反、且此種禁止、尤須各國一致行之、美國亦須令其贊成云、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>國民二十二日内瓦電今日軍縮會議總委員會中德代表那杜尼演説、評論法國所提統一歐洲陸軍制度計劃、各委員對之甚爲注意、那氏聲稱、凡任何制度、苟欲保障各國安全者、必以裁减强國軍備與謀軍備之均衡爲基礎、再從而策劃各種方案、使一切隊成爲防衛性質、故德國以爲必須特别注重下列諸點、第一防衛與侵犯性質之所由判、軍制方面、遠不若軍械之重要、故最重要者、厥惟廢除活動的大砲坦克車與轟炸飛機等侵略軍器、第二關於軍隊之人的問題、不在採用任何特定募集制度、而在大减兵士人數、關於此層、殖民地軍隊必須師入祖國軍隊部分、德國目下固準備討論法國計劃、但必須前述諸問題、先有滿意解决而後可、故特綜合德國軍縮見解、提出决議案、内容除詳論前述諸問題外、提議總委員會在討論法國所提統一軍制問題以前、應先考慮廢除一切侵略軍器與限制作戰材料之則例、並訓令軍力委員會、按照胡佛計劃原則、制定裁减陸軍人數與均衡軍力之規章、於指定期限内、提出報告於總委員會、</p>
<p>又今日航空專門委員會内、則有法航空總長谷德撮述設置國際航空公司、接辦現有各商用航空線、而受國聯監督之計劃、但其他委員罕有贊成者、荷代表路特根聲稱、祇須對於商用航空制定適宜規章、其於防免商用飛機、移作軍用一層、亦將與法國計劃有同樣效力云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十三日紐約電新總統羅斯福頃發表、台維思氏仍留在日内瓦軍縮會議美國首席代表、但又聲言、欲將軍縮問題與經濟問題加以制别、世界軍備之縮减、在彼認爲極屬重要、希望日内瓦軍縮會議能在短時期以内、獲有滿意之結果云、</p>

<p>内有一社會主義女閣員</p>
<p>各方贊許赫爾伍定入閣</p>
<p>路透二十二日華盛頓電　當選總統羅斯福任赫爾爲國務卿、伍定爲財長、民主黨各要人皆以得人爲慶、即獨立共和黨亦加稱許、此足徴羅氏之能得人心、衆院已步參院後塵、表决允予羅氏以改組政府之大權、而得便宜行事、以履行其減輕國用百分之二十五之諾言、蓋衆院已贊成財部郵務經費案之修正文、許總統隨意變動各局、須國會兩院以三分之二之大多數反對、始可止之、衆料胡佛對此、亦必同意、</p>
<p>國民二十二日紐約電可靠方面傳出美當選總統羅斯福已擬定新閣名單、並將有女閣員一人、即爲歷來主持調查勞工情形與生活程度之潘金士女士、担任勞工總長、所備閣員名單如下、國務卿赫爾、財長伍定、陸長爲厄泰州長杜恩、海長爲參議員史潢生、總檢察長（類於司法）總長）爲參議員華爾煦、郵務總長爲經理</p>
<p>選舉運動这法萊、内長伊克士（係芝加谷）律師著名共和黨領袖）、農長台莫鞅、商務總長羅浦、勞工總長爲社會主義家潘金士女士、按内有共和黨二人、蓋因該黨進步派在選舉時擁護羅氏、所以酬庸也、</p>

<p>以戔戔之欵維持海軍</p>
<p>國民二十二日華盛頓電衆院海軍委員會主席文生今日在衆院聲稱、美國今日耗費較多之金錢於咀囓糖菓、而以戔戔之欵維持海軍、倘國會竟容許美國海軍遜於他國、豈非大可笑事、渠要求美國海軍、必須擴充至滿足條約所許之實力、且必須立即擴充、便國防力迅達條約所許之地位、渠爲防免海軍效能再見減削起見、將於下屆國會提案、年撥六千三百萬元、專充造艦經費、云、</p>

<p>路透社二十二日維也納電軍械案就直接行動之觀察點而論、雖可視爲結束、但衆料此事所及於奥國之影響、甚爲遠大、奥政府今覺已爲英法之牒文所辱、據靈敏之觀察家推料、奥政府恐難再存一月、其地位旣因軍械案而减弱、而對於本年一月十日奥國信託公司與外國債權人所訂合同及洛桑條約問題、現復受嚴峻之反對也、衆意英法牒文之最近影響似、爲德意兩國在奥勢力之鞏、此間人士現皆自由表示意見、謂國聯所供奥借欵之法國担認之數將由德國代之云、維也納各報並載有消息、謂德總理希特勒允貸欵奥國、惟以立即舉行選舉、而以基督敎社會黨及國家社會黨組織混合政府爲條件、而外間紛傳捷克斯拉夫近有大批軍火、取道奥境運往南斯拉夫、經官場承認之一事、亦引起民衆之反對、</p>

<p>英美主張一致</p>
<p>路透二十二日倫敦電英美戰債談判在羅斯福三月四日就職以前、未必有切實行動、同時英大使林德賽現正與羅斯福及新任國務卿赫爾從事商榷、今日英下院詢問英首相麥唐納已否有辦法、俾英相可赴美國談判戰債、麥唐納以極明白之詞答稱、談話將即日復開、在談話未有結果以前、不能有關於手續之辦法、但英政府將致力於將來之經濟會議、以期減低一般税率云、</p>
<p>美國議會提高銀價運動復活</p>
<p>主要動機在增加中國購買力</p>
<p>國民二十二日華盛頓電美衆院幣制委員會、昨日决定擱置一切改變幣制方案、後因主張提高銀價派之活動、今日重加考慮、而將小組委員會修改之蘇墨士案、向衆議院提出、該案規定、授權財部、收購白銀共值美金二萬五千萬元、銀價每盎斯在四角至六角之間、該委員會已請衆院規例委員會排入議程、俾可在本屆國會表决、至此案目的、非在澎脹通貨而以提高銀價爲主、故對於購銀數額、予以限制、並聞提高銀價之主要動機、在欲增加中國對於美貨之購買力、藉以推廣對華貿易云、</p>

<p>樸資茅條約之精神</p>
<p>日本代表又稱［中國今日之中心、即有］蘇維埃主義、故爲遠東之一大危機、］又稱、一此項運動之進行、所以未能更速者、厥在日本之存在、蓋蘇俄至少乃尊敬日本者日本若去則揚子江流域之赤化、可以立待、］又稱、一總之日本今日地位、乃爲單人獨馬奮鬥以救遠東之危亡、蘇俄今日猶在國聯之外、益增日本之困難、］又稱、一吾人今日已到國家危急存亡之秋、遠東和平及秩序之恢復、自亦非異人在、日本過去之歷史、已爲諸公所讚美、則日本今日對於遠東事件之知識、對於處理該事件之方法及其對方之地位等等、自可深信無疑也、］從上種種、日本之深懼蘇維埃主義之流傳各處、似可推測而得矣、實則大謬不然蓋日人之提出此種危言、僅爲一種便利的辯論、此點吾人從日本當中國正在以軍事及財政全力在揚子江流域剷除赤匪之時、决定實施其武力佔據滿洲計劃、即可知之矣、</p>
<p>雖然、日本對中國之决心剿除共亂、雖横加阻梗、而中國仍能獲有顯著之成功、豫鄂皖三省剿匪司令蔣介石將軍於其最近上國民政府之報告中、對四月來剿匪成績、已有詳細之陳述、政府於此、一方運用武力、一方運用政治方法、兼籌並進、故昔日之匪區、茲已恢復原狀、</p>
<p>其實、從日代表演辭之另一部分觀之、即可知其自身亦未確信蘇俄之可能的企圖、日代表稱、［蘇俄對於滿洲問題、頗多了解、］又稱、［然吾人應對蘇俄表示感謝者、即吾人不特可以不權戰事之發生、且大有互相成立和平諒解之機會也、］不特此也、日代表且提出日俄聯盟之可能以爲一種三嚇、其言曰、［吾人如能與蘇俄成立確實協定、而不顧任何一切、則試問此後之形勢將若何耶、］此非大可注意者乎、</p>
<p>總之、日本代表之政策、實爲一種對世界各國之恐嚇政策、但其雖已違反其神聖之諾言、仍能飽載以去、試觀其言曰、［日本政府之行爲在國聯盟約下受判斷、應享有伸縮性、此乃吾人常識上均應承認者也、［可以知矣、</p>
<p>然而國聯所基之原則、吾人如冀其有力的爲全世界和平服務、自非有普遍的通用性不可、須知國聯盟約、實爲世界之憲法、故其解釋、亦應爲一致的、無論一事一案、其形勢任何複雜、盟約之大綱·决不能受損害、蓋吾人若創立有效之例外、則該問題本身之性質已爲例外、而任何問題之複雜性或困難性、則僅爲程度問題耳、國聯之主要基礎、若不能依靠爲世界公正和平之柱石者、則世界各國十年來出重價以獲得出心血以灌溉之和平保障、深恐其尚非眞實可靠也、</p>
<p>日本代表所稱［全世界常在轉變中］之一語、固或有至理、惟吾人觀於國聯原則之神聖、則惟有正告日代表曰、任何轉變及任何更正、不應出之於違反國際和平約章、而應出之於對於該約章等之完全的尊重、蓋全世界之和平、乃吾人最神聖之祈求也、（完）</p>

<p>爲什麽青年不愛讀書？</p>
<p>丨丨塘沽郭子珍君來信丨丨</p>
<p>記者先生：有許多難題在［讀者顧問］欄，都蒙先生解决了，我現在有一問題，請先生費些心思，詳爲解釋、不勝感盻：我常聽説有許多青年，因家境不好，想讀書而不能，從來没聽見有人供給而不肯求學深進者，但是我的兄弟，便是這樣一個人。他上有父母，兄二姊一，下有一弟，兄姊都受過高深敎育、父及長兄全遠在新疆省作事。他今年十六歲，去年夏季畢業於北平市立中學，投考高中兩次，全未取上，我很替他憂慮，但是在外作事，也不能天天當而敎導他，乃屢次與他去信，囑伊不必灰心，好在年歲尚幼，努力預備，今年夏季再考；有時我回家去，墾切告訴他説，一個人必須有豐富的常識，將來才能够謀生，這些常識，在學生時代，要由書本裏得到並舉了許多名人，少年受了許多困苦，後來對國家對社會作出了驚人的貢獻的例子，他很以爲然。但是我一走了，家裏只有母親和他的正在求學的姊姊，敎導他只是不聽，心思浮躁，不去温書，感覺在家庭裏，没有趣味，有一次他竟自動的從軍，後經設法，始又回家，伊與我來信，謂願半工半讀，或代謀一事，我知道他是不顧意讀書，所以没有給他找事。我總盼他，趁現在有人供給的時候，求得高深學問，或學得專門的技能，將來做點大事，所以勸他寳貴伊的青年時代，下些苦心，求得眞實的顧問，將來不愁没事作的，但是他似乎仍不覺悟！我現在求先生代爲解答的數點如下：（一）他環境許可他讀書，爲什麽他感覺讀書没趣味，願意謀點事作？（申報月刋關於青年煩悶的問題那篇文章，我已看過）。（二）我如何使他改變他的謀事的心理，繼續求學？（三）是不是可以允許他的要求，謀點事作？以上三點，希望先生代爲費心解答。（復信明日發表）</p>

<p>本月十八日、報載英國文學戲劇家蕭伯訥氏，由粤來滬，本埠名流報　　界學界及藝術界，作熱烈之歡迎者至衆。登陸後，至世界社，當由梅蘭芳與蕭氏接談，蕭氏語氣頗爲尖刻，非梅氏所能敵對，蕭氏以中劇有鑼鼓多雜聲爲指摘，而梅氏所答，謂平劇雖有雜聲，崑劇則無，未免進退失據，顯然自承平劇之不良，而崑劇豈無鑼鼓耶？脱蕭氏於此，加以駁詰，則不知梅氏將何以爲答？如交手然，一無照面，宜蕭氏有中國無文化之言。吾不知蕭氏對梅氏個人而言歟？抑對中國全國而言歟？吾今欲爲蕭君告者，鑼鼓係中國唐代所作，常用以與絲竹合奏，遜清嘉慶二十八年，特於宴養大樂中，加入十番一套，鑼之大小有十種，鼓之大小亦有十餘種，現在所存之譜，尚有十八套，音色有管絃拉擊四大類，樂器至多，凡敲擊類者，均爲複音交響性質，與社會上普通之絲竹小品，截然不同。又考唐史所載：明皇曾在花園中，自以羯鼓作大樂合奏之指揮，頃刻間百花齊放，亦可見鑼鼓價值之一斑矣。吾願蕭君以後勿再作此不完全之論調，吾更願梅君多讀古書，作根本之研究，不再以三十年戲劇生活驕人，蓋三十年前之伶工，大都不學無術，其資格地位，不能與今日之伶工並論，豈梅君未知之乎？吾之此言，爲梅君告，更不僅爲梅君告，凡負有文化之責者，皆當加以注意焉。至於田鄉文化，其狀態如何，蕭君亦未指出，令人莫解，然則中國眞正之文化何在？曰四千年前已有專詞名爲聲敎，（一名禮樂）上自國家大典，下而社會交際，以及士人誦讀，小販營生，甚至乞丐求食，莫不有一部分之音樂化，蕭君之所謂大自然文化者，當在此而不在彼云。</p>
<h3 id="c156">吃飯 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>丨天下無如吃飯難丨</p>
<p>吃飯是最難的事，也是最易的事：　　何以説是最難？古人早已説過，［天下如吃飯難］，實是一句金玉之言。何以説是最易？有了特别的理由，自然吃飯最易；譬如呱呱墮地的小孩，和風燭殘年的老頭兒，那一個不曉得吃：所以説吃飯是天下最易的一件事，這是鐵證，誰也不敢反對。</p>
<p>吃飯的相對論，到如今已經成立了。試看官塲，大商店，以及各種機關裏面的職員，誰不掮着牌頭，捧着橡皮飯盌，吃得面團團像無錫大阿福一般，要是一檢考他們的履歷，却並不是大學校的畢業生，不是姨太太的小兄弟，便是尊夫人的舅老爺，裙帶關係，自然比任何畢業文憑有力。</p>
<p>吃飯的方法，千變萬化；捧飯盌的功夫，巧妙無窮，神而明之，存乎其人，斷非在下一枝秃筆所能描寫得出的。總之，吃飯的藝術，比任何藝術爲重要，奇妙，除非辟穀服氣的朋友，其外誰可不探討吃飯的藝術呢！可是我們中國人吃飯的本領，畢竟研究有素，儘管肚子狹窄，飯盌却亦多多益善，手裏祇捧一只，那裏稱心如意，伸出了手，不妨去搶奪人家的飯盌，一只二只三只四只…………，只要自已吃得飽，想到人家飢餓，眞是笨伯。</p>
<p>我鄉有一種風俗，乞匄闖入飯店裏，吃飽了飯，付不出錢，只要恭恭敬敬地跪在街頭一二小時，便可没事。有人看見笑他；其實，世界上的人，跪了方有飯吃的，佔了多數，母須見了乞匄大笑呀！從前有一位堕落的公子，捧了一只金飯盌來討飯，都説這是一個笑話。其實，現代青年犯着這種毛病的，委實不少，豈不是可嘆的事嗎？</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>丨社會病之一丨</p>
<p>以吾之錢，易彼之貨］。這便是賣買的原素，那是何等公正坦白的事情。你看装着霓虹燈，掛着大廉價的旗幟，這許多的大公司，那一家不人山人海。下至於賣花生米的小販，携着小竹籃；提高着毛竹般喉嚨，也有不少顧客。他們公開地賣着買着，有那個説不是。可是上海的社會，因爲過於文明的緣故，偏有許多的賣買，帶着些神秘的色彩。不信你瞧下列的幾種吧！</p>
<p>白天或是晚上，你倘使走過北四川　，尤其是虬江路華租兩界交界的所在。電桿木旁，立着不少的短衣男子。他們歪帶着鴨舌頭帽：中式的短衣，外罩着西装，像步哨般的密佈。見了青年的男子，尤其是兵船上的水兵，他們緊釘在你後面，口中喃喃的念着；西洋小姐，東洋小姐，貌又美；價文廉，隨你們揀選。</p>
<p>你從四川路向南走着走着，走到了全滬聞名的四馬路。丨便是福州路丨你總瞧見着屋沿下站着不少的面目黧黑衣衫檻褸的老槍。説他们是乞丐吧，他們不向你討錢；説他們是小販吧，他們又拿着任何貨件。不過行路的男子，只要向他望一眼，他便上前來了。什麽西洋的該特兒；東洋的裸體照，説了一大堆。他也會拖住你的衣角，呌你到弄堂裏去看樣本。</p>
<p>你再向南走着，走到了法租界。你倘使穿過幾條著名的弄堂。丨像寳裕里丨倘使你服装漂亮；神氣很健旺，自有一種人迎上前來。先生檯子又開了，阿要去白相相？倘使你面目門黑些；精神萎靡些，那末另有一種人來迎接你，他們却換了一付説白：先生！冷籠清膏，房間清爽，四角錢，一盒。</p>
<p>這幾種都是買賣，他們鬼鬼祟祟，多少總帶些神秘的色彩；也十足顯現着社會的堕落，現在我再附帶説兩種賣買：一種是强賣的人肉，一種是賣出而不買進的毛病，這兩種也有些奇妙而神秘。你晚上走過熱鬧的馬路，只要你衣服穿得鄉谷一些，包你給那些出賣肉和毒的雉妓，團團圍住。伊們用了强姦式和椏賣式的方法，拖你進去，即使你不成不交，也要你破費幾毛錢，方得脱身。　　不論墻壁上或電線木上，歪歪邪邪的黏着幾條紅紙，尤其是冬天，更易見到。原來是出賣重傷風。我想這種賣買，祇有單方面的。倘使有人要收買，那眞荒天下之大唐，一定要笑歪人的嘴巴咧！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>老三！你過來送一送趙二哥］後面屋子裏又擁出了一羣人來，每一個部是短衣窄褲，科着頭，穿着靴子，手裹各提着一件兵器，有的是花槍，有的是單刀，其中還夾着兩個十來歲的小孩子；大家都露着笑，興冲冲地走上廣塲來。中國古勇士的龍馬精神，在這裏，依舊是完全保存着！</p>
<p>田莊主喊聲甫畢，就有一個四十歲左右的中年人，擲下了他手裏的武器，放開了大步奔來。</p>
<p>［趙二哥！這些話都不許説］！老三已代替他老子扶住了趙二哥。［哈哈！錢有什麽有處？你害了病，不能上工，我們正該多送］</p>
<p>些錢給你才是，還談欠不欠嗎？二哥！你要錢用，儘打發你們大嫂來要就得！米也有！一村上的人，還分什麽你我？哈哈！再會吧！恕我不送了］！</p>
<p>［你待我們，眞是太好了！莊主］！趙二哥抱着拳，熱涙在臉上掛着。</p>
<p>［好！保重你的身體！］田莊主深深地嘆了一口氣，轉過身子，離了趙二哥，很矯疾地踏進了那一羣武士的隊伍裏去·</p>
<p>吚喝聲，刀劍聲，顚倒又罩過了六條猛犬的咆哮聲；牠們也立刻自慚形穢起來，便一齊埀下了金絲一般的尾巴，分六路衝退出林外去了。祇剩那害着癩病的花犬，依舊躺在夕陽影裏，繼續賞鑒着牠主人們的演武。</p>
<p>［小鈴！你怎麽老是練不好］？田莊主像騎馬一般的跨在一方絕大的石鎖上，朴刀挿在他的前面，微風吹過，長鬚不住的在刀柄上拂動。受他責駡的是他的小孫子，一個十二歲的孩子。　小鈴使的是一桿長槍。大概是他的力氣不夠的緣故，當他和别人比試的時候，槍桿往往打他自已的手裏落下地來；就爲這一點，田莊主很有些怪他不肯用功。（二）</p>
<p>［再演一回看！像你這樣怎能和倭子們開仗？］小鈴的老子，便是田莊主的第二個兒子，也覺得小鈴太不替他爭氣了！便在他前額上鑿了一個爆栗，勒令他一個人再演；同時又把驚心動目的倭子兩個字去激勵他。（二）</p>

<p>— 豐</p>
<p>談起玻璃室差不多人人都知道　。在巴黎幾乎每個街頭巷屋　都有它的存在。它没有别的標識，唯一的標識就是着色玻璃的窗扉和一盞緋紅的門燈，整日整夜的點着，射出一縷耀人的光線。</p>
<p>它就是巴黎的公娼館。這裏面的技女當然和在街上站崗的不同。僑們當中也有等級，全看妓館的高下爲定。不過伊們都有一個共同之點：就是清潔衛生。伊們每週須經衛生局的檢查二次，患有疾病的就不能再留在館内招待客人。所以狎妓的再没有光顧六○六的危險。</p>
<p>，門鈕一按，裏面的鈴聲就叮噹叮噹的響了。一位女招待立卽就將來客引進一個室内。裏面有的是一排站立着的妓女。伊們都是裸體，讓來客去鑒賞伊們的肉體曲線美。待他一經選定，伊就引他到一臥室。室裏的佈置，無分妓館高下之别，都很雅緻艶美。風洗器具，一概齊全。</p>
<p>衛生也是伊們十分留意的，所以不免對來客加以檢騐或洗滌。這里，無所謂感情，只有性慾。但是留住的時光却有長短之别。錢給的愈多，則留住的時間亦愈久。宿夜也是可以的。久留或暫留都有固定的價目，童叟無欺。暫留是十五分鐘，約須十五佛郎（合華幣三元），這是普通的妓館。高貴點的則須五十餘佛郎（十）元左右）。這種妓館的所以價昂，一半是由於它裏面的妓女比較年輕艶美，一半是由於它裏面的陳設特别精緻。</p>
<p>玻璃室的設立有許多好處：衛生，簡單，滿足男人的性慾要求。這都是保全民族健康的要素。</p>
<h3 id="c161">一個少年的煩惱 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>

<p>他是一個十八歲的青年。一對　眉毛長得非常清秀，眼晴也長得十分明媚。牙齒的凹凸雖不整齊，然而却很潔白。高高的身材，堅實的肌膚。通同凑合起來，不失爲一個美男子。</p>
<p>錢他是有的，肄業滬上某大學每年也得用一千數百元。所以在物質方面以及在學業方面，他都自覺滿意。從來没有不快的情緒顯露。　在海外歸途的輪船中，他有時在甲板上獨自沉思，有時在官艙裏與一位少女攀談。他的表而雖無時無地不是笑容可掬，然而他的内心却透露出一種不可言喻的憂鬱。一日，他的秘密由一位第三者的轉告，被我發見了。原來他是一位有婚姻煩悶的青年。他的父親當他還没到五歲時，就替他訂了婚。因爲他本人生長在南洋，所以一直到今他和未婚妻還没有一面之雅。但據各方面探得的消息，則知道伊貌旣不揚，又未入過學校。因此，在這位青年的腦中，時常縈環看這應否與伊完婚的嚴重問題。　　他的身心不消説是受過現代摩登主義的洗禮的。和一位素不相識又對伊毫無情感的女子結婚，可不是與摩登主義相抵觸嗎？同時又可不是會貽害他的終身幸福嗎？但是不和伊結婚又怎麽立呢？家庭已經對他下兩三道哀的美敦書，説：如果不和家庭替他訂定的女子結婚，那只有以强迫的辦法來對付他。所謂强迫的辦法就是此後斷絕他的學費供給。</p>
<p>在這威脅之下，青年眞是窘了。加以女家再三催促完婚，更使他感到黝黑的前程一天更近一天的呈現在他的眼前。爲這問題，他確實籌思了三天。最後他纔帶着果决的態度對我説：［某先生，我這次回去，無論如何要設法看到］那位女子。好就結婚去，不好只有别圖新徑，也許還要再請敎先生呢。］</p>

<p>— 陽秋</p>
<p>日本帝國主義者又總攻熱河了，這事實並不足驚奇，因爲在實質上，這只　　是九一八東省慘變的侵略暴行之繼續與擴大，而且基於軍事與政治的見地，日帝國主義者决不容熱河此一孤城殘存於落日餘暉之下，尤爲勢所必然。　對於此一繼續擴大的侵略暴行，我們該怎樣呢？我們的答覆是：反抗，鬭爭，以血洗血，以牙還牙！</p>
<p>不過這裏横着幾個問題，我們應該牢牢把握住！</p>
<p>第一，這一爭鬭的意義，不能僅從［國家］或［民族］等空泛的名詞上求之，而是應該從［反帝國主義］這一大題目與歷史使命之下找得其依據。我們的武器是［民族革命戰爭］，我們的目的是［打倒帝國主義］！這種爭鬭不僅是爲了我們民族的解放，而是爲了整個的世界，爲了歷史的前途。　第二，發動民族革命戰爭，自然是應該形成一廣大的［民族戰綫］，全民族總動員。但我們同時認定：受壓迫嚴重者，他的反抗意志愈堅，戰鬭力愈大，所以我們以爲在當前反日遧國主義者的民族革命爭鬭中，不要忽視了受壓迫最深的［勞苦大衆］的助力。</p>
<p>第三，自從十九特委會通過了全部報告草案以後，也許有許多人忍不住要歡呼慶祝，認爲這是［正義的勝利］，是［國際的助力］。實際上，假使我們不故意忽視英駐華府大使林德華向美國務院提議以新加坡供美海軍使用作爲戰債談判與經濟會議的交換品，以及華盛頓方面積極策動戰債談判與經濟會議等等的事實，則可知國聯對日態度之忽然略轉强硬，完全是由戰債談判换來。人家正各爲其本身利益大敲其如意算盤，我們却認爲是［正義的勝利］，這種錯誤的認識，與向國聯乞憐的舉動是同樣的卑怯，同樣的淺薄無聊！</p>
<p>把握住上述的三個重要問題，把握住民族革命爭鬭這一武器，這是必要的，否則我們將不知道是爲什麽而戰，爲什麽而死！</p>

<p>— 王宛容女士</p>
<p>潔：</p>
<p>昨天我便已安抵Ｌ城，在城裏姑母家寄宿了一宵。今天清晨我脱去了旗袍，解下了圍巾，穿上姑母給我預備好的青布長袍，戴上羶帽，對鏡一照，呵！潔！我眞是個十足的鄉下青年了！你知道，我要是不這樣化装，便不能回家，半路上便會給土匪們帶上山去。</p>
<p>我的家離Ｌ城有五十多里，我在早上七時動身，到家也不過十二時多。走急路，倒不覺寒冷。可惜路上的雪被陽光一照，慢慢地溶化了，我穿着表哥借給我的一雙破皮鞋，眞難走，否則我還可以早一小時到家呢！</p>
<p>您們回家是叙天倫之樂，跟媽媽撒嬌，和弟弟們放花砲；我呢？我没有父母，向誰去撒嬌？也没有天眞的弟妹，只有兩個雄糾糾的哥哥；姪姪也有幾個，雖然都不滿十歲，但是誰都會放槍了；我這次回家，委實没有什麽快活！</p>
<p>這裏一開門便是一座山，山上有狼，晚上躺在床上聽狼呌倒是最有趣的一件事。上山時常有兎兒奔下來，我見了便追，它曁起兩隻耳朶，閃動着兩顆紅寳石似的眼向樹林中奔，要是我發起很來，只要從肩上卸下槍來，描準一下，當、</p>
<p>天便有一隻鮮美的兎吃，但是我究竟不忍心對這樣活潑可愛的小動物下這種毒手，啊！索性殺人倒也吧了！</p>
<p>今年還算太平這裏附近還没有出過什麽大的岔子，大約可以安安穩穩的過年。我告訴您我過去的一些生活經騐罷：　　我們這裏的房子都有着黑面高的牆，都有六七扇大門。我五歲的初年，土匪大夥兒圍着我家的門，我父親知道寡不敵衆，便把門統統開了，大聲地説：有膽量的請進來］，土匪們以爲裏面有什麽防備，一個個悄悄地溜走了，却不知道我爸爸唱的是空城計呢！</p>
<p>四五年前的一個深夜，我被一陣狗吠驚醒了，悄悄地從窗縫中向外一看，呵！眞了不得！又是大夥兒的土匪來了，手中點着明晃晃的火把。我呌醒了哥哥和嫂嫂（那時我的爸媽早已故世了），從窗眼中舉着槍向下打，土匪們也向上還擊，彈子在我們頭頂上掠過，這一塲恶鬭的結果，土匪死了四個，也記不清是誰打死的，其餘都逃了。第二大早上，我對鏡一照，眞糟！頭頂上的髮兒已焦了一大塊！</p>
<p>又是一年，那時我正在城裏讀書呢！有許多土匪在我們村落附近札了營，時常出來打家刦舍，我大哥合許多村人和他們厮殺，結果，我的大哥被擄了土匪要我們用五萬塊錢在第二天清早去贖，我們那兒有許多錢呢？當夜合家决定去和土匪拚命。其實誰都心裏明白，這一去非但救不出大哥，並且大家一起死在土匪手中也説不定，可是我們誰都没有説一句膽怯的話。走不多路，就看見遠遠地一片紅光，一片呌殺的聲音，起初我們以爲土匪有了準備，走近去·才知道土匪們和另一村莊上的保安隊在厮殺，大哥躺在樹林深處，哼着。潔！原來土匪看見保安隊去打他們，他們以爲是去搭救我大哥，於是把我大哥剌了幾刀，丢下他去應戰去了，所以大哥倒在樹林中哼着。第二天清晨，土匪逃光了，我們去看土匪的住宅，大莊屋裏面，有丢在那兒的百多條棉被，十幾隻水牛。　　自從這次以後，土匪們好久没有光臨了，姑母幾次勸我們搬進城去住，但我嫂嫂捨不得那高山，那溪流，那些桃樹，那些芋田。我呢？也以爲不該太怯弱，白白的讓土匪把這美麗的村落佔去。　　在校中委實有些過不慣，同桌子的蘇州小姐老是笑我的食量大。有一天我們讀社會學的去參觀模範監獄，路上遇見一隻獨自在行走的馬，那班見了狗打架也戰慄的姑娘們一個個都駭慌了，我看了好笑，走上去把馬牽住，她們才躡着脚走過去，眞柔弱得可憐又可笑！</p>
<p>今年可惜没有土匪，否則我一定會呌緊來這裏住幾大，您雖然也是那嬌樣兒，不過	您是喜歡勇剛强的，您在校中不是對我説麽？［毓！吃飽了麽？不要］餓瘦了，回去没力氣殺强盜］。潔，現在我旣没有消瘦，力氣也還是那麽大，不過可惜没有强盜可殺呀！</p>
<p>我住不慣老家，天氣稍暖，我又會要出來的。再見！您的朋友毓。一九三三，一，十六。</p>

<p>— 振甫</p>
<p>自從春風吹盡了寒冷的雪花，帶來　　子絲絲的細雨，不禁令我想到了故鄉的春，憶念起鵡湖了。鵡湖，牠雖然比不上西子湖的美麗，太湖的浩蕩，可是她的幽静，牠的樸素，也自有可以使人留戀的地方；何况牠是我二十多年相親的老友，寂寞時候的惟一安慰者呢？</p>
<p>鵡湖就在中山先生所計劃建築的東方大港西北三十里左右。牠祇有樸素的衣裳，和靄的微笑，倘然你在都市中受不了激烈的剌激，你厭煩了汽車電車馬車和其他一切機械的呼聲，或許你感到神經衰弱的都市病已染上了身時，那末，像鵡湖這種地方，你就可以賞識牠的幽静美了。</p>
<p>點綴着鵡湖而增加牠的美的，是公園的楊柳和湖東的五層寳塔。在從前，公園是被稱作鸚鵡洲的。因爲他是被鵡水環繞着和芳草點綴着的緣故吧？其實，在那裏是我不到一點鸚鵡的影子的。總是爲了唐人的［芳草萋萋鸚鵡洲］的一句詩吧？弄得使牠得了這個不相干的名詞。其實這也是我們貴國人的習性，你不見［稻香村］的店招到處皆是嗎？好像不是這樣古雅的名詞，就要黯然無色似的，公園之被稱爲鸚鵡洲，也不過是這種心理的表現罷了</p>
<p>在鵡湖，我們可以領略到春光的緩緩歸來，當地上的芳草漸漸的綠了，柳條漸漸的嫩黄了，春便在這裏報告牠已緩緩歸來了。鳥在奏着歡迎的歌，柳在摇着歡迎的旗，湖水也現着歡迎的笑顏，一切都在歡迎着春的到來。</p>
<p>最好是在月夜，泛着一隻小小的船，同一二個知心的人，划着漿，在鵡湖裏遊着。鵡湖大體是圓的，天上的月印到湖心裏去，相互的輝映着，一片銀光，粉飾了整個的湖面。當雙漿划到湖心的時候，那眞像擊破了水中的明月，銀光撩亂，差不多疑心我們已經划到銀河裏去了。柳條拂着銀光，輕輕地舞着，薄雲淡淡地浮着，東南方的塔影，隱約可以辨認，這眞是一幅幽美的静景啊。　　有時候没有月，點點繁星，佈滿空中。倘然你怕划小船危險的話，那不妨到公園裏去散步，看看平静的湖水，好像一面鏡子，映出點點星光，似珍珠，似寳石，似千萬點的情涙，洒滿了空中。在草地上，更可以坐着臥着，聽幽微的湖水的歌聲，柳條和風的談話，在這裏，你可以領略大自然的秘密，你可以沈醉在大自然的懷抱中，你可以忘去一切煩惱苦悶，這裏没有大都市的煩噪，没有摩登社會的醜惡。</p>
<p>春已經回到人間來了，在鵡湖，柳條也許由淺黄變到嫩綠了，湖水也許依舊含着淺淺的微笑，我在雨夜的上海，不禁想起了你，不曉得在柳條跳舞着，鳥兒歌唱着，湖波淺笑着，歡迎春的歸來的時候，親愛的鵡湖能憶起數百里外在想念着你的故人否？</p>

<p>昨日客秈續有抵埠、惟本客去化仍活、市面迄居堅站之局、查閩帮胃口尚有繼續暢装之意、因該埠去歲存糧不足、如向産區定辦及赴南洋購装、均不合划、且其手續繁雜、反比在滬購辦爲煩、故此後去胃尚多、茲因該地購價難高、行情大大亦難合划也、本街上國河下米改接新斛後頗不便利、且齊頭不多、洋杜各尖合價反比吝　爲高、兼有四戶間、此後胃口亦打繼續之可能、但行情太高、則又須被河下各尖軋脚矣、昨稍有到頭、去化不及日　之旺、故紅　各米均居定勢、統市福州帮辦去江西機晚五百包、湘紅糙四百八十八包、泉州帮去湘機紅二百五十包、其餘統爲木街辦去、全日開出江西機晚一千二百包、湖南機紅米五百包、又紅糙米四百八十八包、南京車策二百四十九包、南京秞米係昨日新到、貨品稍次、比日前售價小一角、</p>

<p>交消前的麥市</p>
<p>近期忽現最低紀錄</p>
<p>昨日期麥又趨停寂之象、本月份因交部已過、買戶多事了給、目下實在籌　、祗聞鼎泰要交出十餘車、其餘均已塲外結脱、不過到此地步、業外收貨當然困難、所以開價又小至二錢半、較前日續小一分、爲最低紀錄、遠期又空拍居多、市間一無升沉、惟現貨洋麥定價濫鬆、且阿根庭之存底豐厚、此後傾銷、將無已時云、</p>

<p>努力建設居民陡增</p>
<p>城市農村打成一片</p>
<p>一自九一七年後、蘇聯城市之發展、可分兩個時期、一爲一九三一年一九二二年、此時期因食物困難和工業衰落、人民逃入農村、二爲自一九二三年起、工業發展、至一九二六年城市更大加繁盛起來、</p>
<p>在一九二一年、蘇聯城市人口、由二千萬突減至一千六百萬、此時適爲俄國革命時代、全國被各國武装干涉和沙皇白衛軍所包圍、努力爭取自已的生存、一切力量、皆投之於載塲上、工業生産總額、因缺乏原料、到一九二○年、僅及一九一三年産額百分之十八、而工業中工人竟減至百分之四十三、除黑土地帶（俄國主要的農業）區域）外、城市人民在一九一六年至一九二○年間、竟縮減了百分之三十五以上、在中部更形厲害、在其他各地、則減了百分之二十七以上、彼得堡居民、自一九一○年至一九二○年損失了百分之六十二、連半世紀以前一樣了、莫斯科則達到了一八九七年的程度、莫斯科居民喪失了十七萬五千、列寗格勒居民喪失了一百五十萬、巴庫居民喪失了四萬第尼普羅彼　羅夫斯克居民喪失了五萬、哈爾科夫居民、喪失了二萬五千、史達林格勒居民、喪失了四萬八千、薩麻拉居民喪失了七萬四千、尼西尼商羅得居民、喪失了五萬七千、</p>
<p>在這幾年中、塔什干及其他農業區域、吸收了由城市逃出來的人民、而農村［空閑］之人民、由一九一七年、到一九一九年、增高了百分之六十至八十、</p>
<p>同時、大工業中工人數目亦激滅、由一九一三年之二百五十九萬九千人、到一九二○年減至一百五十八萬五千了、大俄羅斯三十省中、共減了百分之三十、莫斯科由一九一八年八月起至一九二○年七月、則減了百分之四十又八、</p>
<p>近幾年來、蘇聯大工業中心空前未有的發展和繁盛、十萬人口以上之城市、數目暴增了、二萬至四萬人口的中等城市、也在急速增長着、大多數人民、則日益吸引於工業、而且蘇聯有許多城市、其增長不僅不落後於歐美城市發展的速度、而且超過之、</p>
<p>譬如美國汽車寗業之大中心德特羅、自一九○○年至一九二七年的二十七年間、其居居才增加了約五倍、而蘇聯的德特羅史達林格勒、僅僅五年之内、居民就增加了一倍多、尼西尼商羅德現改名爲高爾基）十一年間、居民約增了四倍、德國煤礦業中心愛農城、自一九○一年至一九二○年的二十年間、其居民始增了三倍、而蘇聯的史耀林諾僅僅八年之内、（一九二三年至一九三一年）居民就增了六倍、同期馬卡也夫卡則增了十倍、法國紡織工業大中心的里昂、從一九○○年至一九二六年的二十六年間、其居民只增了五分之一、而蘇聯的伊凡諾　、於十一年間就增了三倍、</p>

<p>就整體言之、自一九二六年至一九三二年、各民族共和國工業人口增長之百分比如下、俄羅斯爲二一七·五、鳥克蘭爲一五三·六、鳥芷别克只塔什干）爲二五九、土耳克門爲二一一、蘇聯工業之發展、如顧計到各民族共和國之從前落後、將工業平均的分配於全聯邦的、所以各民族共和國工業人口之增長、有如斯普遍而迅速的、在帝俄時代、市政支出比例、與國家　出比較、在全世界上是最少的國家、在英國此種比例爲百分之九十、在丹麥爲百分之八七·二、瑞士爲六八·五、而在俄國只爲百分之八·五而已、就是這一區區數目中、用於各民族僻遠地方者、更微乎其微、在帝俄時代、鳥克蘭市政設備、所謂最進步者、在歐戰前久已有自來水之設備、但其主要城市基也輔、據該城市議會會長約瑟夫、於一九一三年在全城第一屆代表大會上講演説道、該城電燈電車、只係［中等］階級、索性説有錢的人享用、［置電燈的小住宅、我從未見過、在電車］工上我從來没看過一個工人、］但現在的蘇聯、自來水·水溝·電車·電燈等主要建設、均設置於工人區域、隨着工業之發展、産生了整個新的城市、</p>
<p>近四年來、全蘇聯公益事業之投資、約達二十萬萬盧布、而新的住宅、建設費要達三十五萬萬盧布、</p>
<p>一九三二年終所添新住宅、和同年正月一日前所有者比較、計新達吉爾增了百分九五、庫斯聶茨增了百分之九○、沙哈特增了百分之八三、伯列斯尼克增了百分之八十、戚拉寳斯克增了七○·七、諾富西比爾斯克增了百分之四十、</p>
<p>另一方面、我們看到、西歐各國大城市中心居民之激减、任何房屋建築、幾乎完全停止、大批失業者因無力交納房租而搬出住宅了、</p>
<p>第二次五年計劃之編製、是以消滅城市與農村間之對立爲指導原則、卽决定［全國以後工業］建設發展之路線、須在農民區域去創建新的工業中心、因之須能漸次使城市與鄉村間之差别完全消滅、］</p>
<p>在這一方針之下、不僅工業建設、已按全國地域平均配置、而且在國營農塲和集體農莊的基礎上面、農村裏已廣大創立了機器曳引機站、成爲實施農業機械化的中心、</p>
<p>所以、在第二次五年計劃期間、因機器曳引機站網之擴大發展、農業機械化之普遍深入、與夫落後區域工業之龐大建設、城市與農村間之區别、將在蘇聯消滅了、</p>

<p>— 阿唐</p>
<p>今天在本刋着見亦然君的一篇［酒釀］，我就聯想到了［油條］。</p>
<p>［酒釀］［油條］這類東西底製造法，當然是從前人暗中𢱢摸，决不是根據什�</p>
<p>麽科學知識而得的，而現在我們却能夠發現這些東西的製造顯示着很有趣的化學原理：可見化學與日常生活的關係的重要了。</p>
<p>現在來講講油條的製造法和化學上的原理。</p>
<p>先預備冷清水一碗，約四百立方糎，把明礬細末五公錢溶解在水内，再加小蘇打三公錢，食鹽二公錢半，用捧攬　，以完全溶解爲度，這時碗内就有許多泡沫發生·把泡沫吹開，碗内河水變成白濁色，這水就是使油條膨漲而發空的，現在把牠的化學作用方程式寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）明礬和水的化學作用：</p>
<p>２Ａ１Ｋ（ＳＯ４＋Ｈ２Ｏ２Ａ１ＯＨ）３Ｋ</p>
<p>２ＳＯ４３Ｈ２ＳＯ４</p>
<p>明礬　水輕養化鋁　硫酸鉀　硫酸</p>
<p>（二）小蘇打加入後，便加硫酸作用，公式如下：</p>
<p>３Ｈ２ＳＯ４ＳＨＮSHNaCO3　3NA2SO46</p>
<p>H2O　6CO2</p>
<p>硫酸　小蘇打　硫酸鈉水炭酸氣　　現在要做第二步的手續了，把這種水和入四公兩的細麥粉内，不住的用手揉拌成糊狀，用雙手捧起來，要使這麥粉糊能從指縫間漏下爲度，然後將　移置版上，牽成條帶狀，闊七糎許，再用刀横切成小條，把二小條相疊，用竹管輕輕一壓，再把牠拉長，絞成螺旋條，置入灼熱的油鍋内，待牠膨大而現焦黄色以後，油條便成功了。</p>
<p>當油條置入油内煎的時候，包舍在麵糊裏的炭酸氣受到强度的灼熱，體積膨大，這時又因油條外面的小粉，變成糊精，同麵筋質結合，防止裏面炭酸氣外洩，因此油條受炭酸氣的壓力而膨大了。</p>
<p>至於輕養化鋁，硫酸鉀硫酸鈉這些東西，都留在油條内，但是這些都是無毒的，諸位吃油條的時候，儘可放心。</p>

<p>别了，從最後一次的苦吻裏暫别了　　説也可憐，從小生長在大都會裏的我，素來没有做過一次異鄉客；這回爲了國家的生存，民族的生命，破題兒第一遭到這苦寒的北國裏來。小的時候常常聽見父親説：北方是怎樣的寒冷，怎樣的疾苦，現在總算一切都身歷其境了。自從去冬到此地以來，天天在下着大雪，山，田，村落，都沉浸在銀色的世界裏。氣候的寒冷，往往在華氏零下十幾度，堕指烈膚是數見不鮮的。有詐多弟兄們，竟因氣候的不慣，被死神刧持去了。［古來征戰幾人回］，着實是有意思的。然而我們此刻已完全忘却了自身的生存，自已的肉體，早已獻給了生命</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>之神。死，好像是於我們没有任何關係的。我們無時不在準着死，死，死，爲中華全民族的解放而犧牲底死是光榮的，是偉大的。</p>
<p>現在我們軍實補充完畢，已由後防開抵前綫某處。日來全綫沉寂異常，僅兩方步哨時有小的接觸，在我們的上空也不時有敵人的鐵鳥來去偵察，此外，一點没有什麽動静，簡直使我們不相信這是戰塲。每天在深深的戰壕中，大家都是很快樂的，説也有，笑也有，響澈的話匣子也不時一曲一曲的送來悦耳的歌音，好像戰爭的前奏曲，慶祝我們勝利似的。碰碰碰………撲撲撲……敵人總攻了。一陣殺聲，一陣槍聲，緊接着的便是一陣白刄的嘶殺。上帝喲，請給我們這個時候吧！我們滿含着樂意在等候呢。</p>
<p>Ｘ，我最好的人，我最愛的人，請你放心吧！必死的人一定是不會死的。那般醉生夢死的不抵抗者，説不定死神不會光顧的。中國現在無時無地不有死的危險，天災可以死，共匪可以死，軍閥的混戰可以死，帝國主義的侵略可以死，無往而不在死神的揶揄中。我們與其眼睜睛的望着國土的變色，義勇軍的被各個擊破；倒不如痛痛快快的到前綫來，以血肉之軀與敵人拚個你死我活。我們這樣的頭顱，也值得敵人一粒之子彈。家内的事體，還要你竭力維持！我們的相聚，着實太短促了。彼此的内心，必然的形成一個大的缺陷。然而我們已獻身於國家與民族的解放底人，只有以全國家與全民族的全部愛情爲對象，而奮鬭，而犧牲，自已的靈魂，已深深的潛合在整個民族的大靈魂裏。我們現在爲追求全民族的愛的生活起見，不惜以祈死的精神去衝鋒陷陣，Ｘ，請你替我們祝福！戰機危迫，就此擱筆。祝你健康！你的Ｘ於熱邊最前綫</p>
<h3 id="c269">我們的出路 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 宓耳</p>
<p>當此百業蕭條，經濟恐慌，强鄰壓境，人心險惡的時候，我們丨青年們丨無時不感到［出路］的困難。正像吳子胥未過昭關時迷路在山谷中的情形。可是他那時還有人會明白指示他的出路。而我們呢？無請我們怎樣呐喊，號哭，誰會來理我們？照這樣看來，我們的處境比吳子胥的的確困難得多了！換句話説，我們的處境，正像［船頭上跑馬，走］頭無路］呢丨</p>
<p>的確，有許多青年因了職業或經濟問題而感到痛苦和失望。有的因了外患日迫和本國前途的艱難而感到悲觀。有的雖有了職業而覺得位置不能永久，因此感到煩悶。有的有了職業而受到［第五階級］的壓迫，因此感到怨恨。最後而最普遍的，因失戀而淪爲頽靡。</p>
<p>上述種種，當然爲現代一般青年丨少數除外丨的苦悶。就是作者本人，其中的種種酸甜苦辣也多領略過，也曾化了許多時間把所遭遇的從頭至尾以客觀的方法考量過，最後的結果丨丨不，同時也是我們的敎訓丨丨告訴我：除了自已發奮努力以改造自已的處境而外，實在没有第二條［出路］！</p>
<p>讓我來舉個例吧。譬如我的愛人離我而去了，這時候我起初當然要感到懊喪，可是我的結論是：我自後當列努力地來增進我的學識，更克苦地來鍜鍊我的體格，將來再找位更合我意的伴侶！有時碰到［第五階級］壓迫的情勢，起初當然要感到氣憤，而結論是：努力！用功！待我才智達得相當程度而能謀得相當職位時，我就將不顧一切而洋洋然去之！</p>
<p>總之，在我們生命進程中，每個失望，懊喪，悲憤，在在多是給我們一個奮發有爲力圖上進的機會！或許有人以爲這完全是理想吧。其實，不！因爲作者自已從初小三年級出來，碰到上述的不幸，没有一次不這樣激勵自已的志趣，而没有一次不成功的。我脱離初小三年級後，就進商界，自賬房的學徒，而接線生，而初中敎員，而高中敎員。近年來在一個國際機關裏當翻譯了。</p>
<p>最後我還得聲明的，就是：在我的進程中，並没得到慈善家的哀憐，大人物的帮助，愛人的慰藉，或親戚的提携。換句話説，是完全靠着自已的努力和奮鬧以達到我理想中的目標！［努力］和［奮鬥］，當然是我唯一的出路。讀者們如有其他［出路］，我們很希望提出來。一方固然可以完成這篇抛磗引玉的絀著的用意，一方還可指示許多陷於苦悶中之青年的途徑！</p>

<p>朱博士背着學生，在黑板上寫美國式的英文。不知是否欲表示他的英文博學起見，寫來太快一點？黑板上的粉灰，吹進博士的眼睛。他恐學生放出他們的大學脾氣，來一個哄堂大笑：急忙伸手到西装袋裏，摸他來路貨的絲織手帕。所謂無巧不成書，連摸了幾個袋子，都空空如也。博士　了一隻眼眼，那一付窘態，白臉上也映出了紅暈。更巧皇后陸小姐，特别注意他的態度，她不由不自知的微微一笑，朱博士爲强自鎭静起見，也免强微微一笑，以爲掩飾。　　散課後。</p>
<p>丨皇后同小白臉做媚眼哩！</p>
<p>丨照照鏡子去吧！</p>
<p>某日。</p>
<p>已是午後五時，皇后陸小姐和她的表妹在校園中散步，許多自以爲有皇帝資格的大脚褲，表面上也安閒的到校園中散步。皇后眼快，忽然看見朱博士從校長室中出來，那興怱怱趕路的姿勢，陸小姐想起粉灰飛進眼睛的一幕窘態來。她偷偷的告訴表妹，並且指指在走近前來的朱博士。大概女人都是善笑的，表妹竟咯的一聲笑了出來，於是我們的皇后也忍無可忍的微微一笑。朱博士凑巧已走到她們眼前，他也非笑不可的莫明其妙的微微一笑。</p>

<p>青年學子應該吸烟麽？</p>
<p>在這裏我講的烟，當然不是［大］烟，而是［紙］烟。</p>
<p>在現社會裏，吸烟一件事，可説極其普通而且是盛行，就是在求智時代的未成年的青年，視爲吸烟是可樂的，可解疲勞的，是的，紙烟可以解除人們的煩悶與疲勞，但是對於一個未成年的青年却有害而無益，因爲烟質内含有尼古丁毒質，並且能减低記憶力，故各國有禁未成年人吸食之條例，在我國學校中，禁止吸烟，當然也是很嚴，但是他們却明知故犯，不以吸食爲有害，這種未成年而吸烟的事情，雖然很小，但是我們把他澈底的思量一下，牠的弊端却有下面三種：</p>
<p>（一）有害身體</p>
<p>（二）耗金錢</p>
<p>（三）金錢外溢（除吸國貨者外）</p>
<p>就上面三項觀之，牠的損耗也就可觀了，並日烟的益處很小（可説没有），不吸對於我們並無有損，當此國難臨頭更應貯財以對外，年輕人固不要吸他，就是立足於社會中的人，在一定的範圍内，把這消耗的金錢化爲有用，捐助義軍，我想全國上下一致實行的話，他的爲數，也就可驚了。</p>

<p>傍晚，傍晚的城市好像老人昏睡着吸烟一般朦朧，紫色的影子緊映着十月時節的栗樹和榆樹，西方的日光漸漸地沉下了，</p>
<p>沿着喬丁，屋克，惠西等街，偉大而美麗的房屋中閃鑠着黄色的燈光·燈光照射在鋼琴上，燭臺，磁櫉中的盆碟上·晚餐的香味送來了·城市中一般文明的家庭都園聚着進膳，在刀叉相擊，杯盆相傳中，歡顏油嘴裏糢糊的談笑白天經過的不相干的事·</p>
<p>寒冷暮色的黑影只倒在陋巷中·蓋着油布的桌上放着火油燈，從那燈罩中放出的火烟絲升到天花板上·爐竈的後面掛了等着乾的在礦坑工作穿的衣服·那掛着的衣服的動摇，使屋中充滿了可怕的景象·這些衣服是每日作工時要穿的·抹塗着污泥的靴子踐踏在凝濘的坑泥中·那穿在靴子裏的脚走在污泥的枕木上，直到那坑道去·</p>
<p>一個粗臉的婦人切着麫包，將猪油抹上，又夾了一片鹹肉·她將麫包放在圓鐵罐中，蓋上蓋子·壺中嗡嗡的響聲相呼應着·熟習的手指開了蓋，便放出一團如傘般大的水氣，她撮了些咖啡放進那滾水中，同時，她又想到了爐竈後面掛的污濁的衣服·濕氣已消失了，彼特，翌晨礦廠吹氣笛時，可以穿了爬向礦坑中去了·</p>
<p>彼特睡在樓上的牀上，也可以説是正在幻想·每天，他工作回來，先要苦訴一番·生活，他很痛苦的講，不是青年時代的生活了·坑洞猶如地獄一般·每天的工作只覺得困苦，卑賤·</p>
<p>浴盆中已預備好適當的冷水，再加了些熱水·彼特將那汗濕透的内衣脱下·兩手用粗的肥皂磨擦胸部·再呌瑪琍來代他擦背·他再用肥皂擦着全身，然後將耳，鼻，及嘴唇上下的髒污挖去·</p>

<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>八年前我因爲拜望一個父親的朋友，到好萊塢去。我那位父執是在戲院子裏做事的。我到了好萊塢他就拿我介紹金威獨ＫingYidoi做一個没有名字的小演員。經過了一年半，我漸漸上升了，我第一次做要角，是和曼琪勃萊曼ＭadgeBellamy合演［青春之翅］。</p>
<p>那時我還没有進福克斯公司。我有個朋友在福克斯做演員。他勸我進福克斯。這天我手裏拖着一隻鴨舌頭便帽，被馬利硬拉進了弗蘭克巴柴其的辦公室。馬利滔滔不絕的向巴柴其替我説好話，巴柴其好像没有聽見似的，祇管向我看。後來他好像考試般的問了我許多話就同我訂了合同。</p>
<p>我永遠忘不了的一天，便是巴柴其把［七重天］演員單上志高Ｃhico名字下面註定由却爾福雷扮演。我和珍妮蓋諾二人的缘分，亦可以説從這天開始的，　　從［七重天］一片之後，我和珍妮連續做了十一張片子，其中有幾張我自已知道是失敗的，最使我滿意的是［七重天］［街上安琪兒］［婚後第一年］［高等社會之外貌］和我同珍妮的告别作［情潮］五張了，</p>
<p>我在福克斯合演過的有瓊蓓納德，瑪琳奈克遜，愛麗莎萊第，珍妮蓋諾幾個，但是我這次脱離福克斯，祇有同珍妮蓋諾最覺得戀不捨，其他幾個不過平常朋友的道别般罷了，</p>
<p>我離開福克斯，完全像離開了慈母。在那邊我有許多兄弟姊妹們仍舊很快活的在一起，但是我不能再同他們過兄弟姊妹的生活了</p>
<p>我同珍妮　别的那天，各自話了聲［珍重］後，我祇覺得一陣辛酸險些流下涙來。這時可惜攝影師没在旁邊，否則他一定攝進鏡頭去，果然如此，我同珍妮不知拍了多少幕的劇，這一幕倒是最顯出我們眞情的一幕紀念劇呢！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c274">初春中的春波艶影 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>近來德俄兩國的影片，已給了我們絕佳的印象，使美國影商驚惶失措着。我們所見到的約分兩種，第一是極有義意的社會描寫片，如西線活地獄和慾潮等等。第二種是音樂歌舞片，如龍翔鳳舞歡喜緣（所有的人和報章上都以爲這是英國片其實是德國的）等等。第一種是美國片望塵莫及的。第二種也能和美國片並駕齊驅。這一次新光的［春波艶影］ＭonteＣarloＭadness，就屬於此類的英文歌舞片。</p>
<p>他的本事有一些像幾部好萊塢出産的艶史。有一位女王因爲軍艦舞餉不服調度，她知道艦長在蒙的卡羅，她也就追了去。不料一見之下，突生愛慕之心，於是同游共舞。艦長却不知道她是女王。後艦長輸去巨欵心中不服逼令賭塲原數送回，不然用砲轟炸海岸。女王不以爲然，當了全艦兵士，免艦長之職。他羞忿之下，至終取回巨欵費付水手的餉金。他却乘了另一隻船打算上擅香山去。女王中心不捨　　　船迫去。茫茫大海　　　的追隨而去就作了這影片的尾聲。</p>
<p>在一本劇裏，是找不出什麽特殊意義，只是在説［愛情］是世界上最有力的東西罷了。</p>
<p>導演是很靈敏的，採取了極有意味的背景，組織成一個整個的影片。一起一收，都安静很很，呌人能有餘味可尋。影緻非常佳妙，内景也不錯。攝影是大陸派，光線也極適宜。側寫穿挿·動人深思，説句時髦話，牠在繁華之中，還帶着幽默，</p>
<p>演員都是對于我們很生疏的臉，但是無名的，正不乏眞英雄。飾女王的莎麗瑪力珊ＳariＭaritza有超越的豐神。對于表演上，有勝過麥唐娜的地方。而且華貴天眞，兼而有之，扮艦長的漢阿爾勃斯健美的體格，呌人欽羡。他也有很好的表情，其餘内的配角，都極良好，所可惜的，唱得太少，［莎麗］一句也没唱，這樣未鋗是辜負了極好的音樂了。　　牠旣然以蒙的卡羅爲重心，那末不外下列四件事！跳舞塲，賭塲，金錢，女人！窮奢極慾，的確可以引爲聽視之娛的極點，不過内中多少也帶了對女子輕視丨玩弄的色彩。佈景上有一個漏點，就是女王的行宮太簡陋了些。</p>
<p>這是一張純粹藝術的成功體，牠有呌人覺得愉快！詼諧！滿足！種種複雜的心情，喜歡看電影的人，不妨看一次，牠或美國歌舞片，多少有一些異味的風趣。</p>

<p>iver喬治亞烈士ＧeorgeＡrliss等六七位著名明星的扮相談話的樣子，也是很難能可貴的。</p>
<p>全片中有很抑揚的音樂，以及八支甘許文ＧeorgeＧerhwin的歌曲，很是悦耳的，祇是［舞］却不像廣告上那麽形容，祇有很少的一二幕。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｄiuorce　in　Ｔhe　Ｆamilv</p>
<p>這一影片在我們面前提出了一個嚴重的問題，而且是目前不易於得到解决的問題：當我走出劇場之後，我覺得如此。</p>
<p>本片中叙述一個忠實於自已的事業的考古家，爲了環遊世界而增進自已的學識，不得不終年旅行而棄置妻子。其後，妻爲着自身的孤寂而熱戀着一個醫生而且要嫁給他，但是，自已的孩子勢必然携之歸依後夫，雖然是後夫也厚道的而樂於接受，可是孩子却不願失却生父的情愛而與一陌生的父親共同生活。可是最後終於在不能解决的情形之下而受後父的保養。關於這些，我們在許多隨母出嫁或是受着後母之虐待的孩子的心靈中，得着許多實際的證明，劇中雖然提出了這些問題，並没有得着一個結論。但是，這問題恐怕不是現實的社會所能解决的吧？除非經濟基礎已有了徹底的變換。</p>
<p>正因爲抓取了這種複雜的題材，正因爲對於這劇中各人的行動都不能加以非議或咀咒（當然是指不戴老花眼睛鏡）而言），所以本劇的導演確是擔當了頗不平凡的工作，而是非常吃力的。當然，他必須將孩子的描寫作中心，但是對於其他各人，却也不能鬆懈。那末，本片的導演，在這幾點上都是很成功的，但是也不能説是盡善盡美，至少他對於父親的描寫，還是不夠充分的。</p>
<p>如上所述，本劇的幾個重要演員都是非常吃力的。特别是那個孩子，眞是非賈克古柏，ＪackieＣooper不能做到，我們對於這個出人頭地的小明星，確是值得欽敬。做父親的魯意斯東Ｌouis</p>
<p>Stone，我們在好些塲合領敎過他的技巧，他在這一片中更是正得其人。至於飾母親的康勒南格爾ＣonradＮagel雖然並不失敗，但比以上二人，總覺遜色。</p>
<p>他如其他各佈景，燈光，收音等，都不曾令我們掃興，但也没有特别驚人的技巧。</p>
<p>整個的説來，這是米高梅公司中不可多得的片子，就其題材上，很值得我們加以注意。</p>

<p>差不多有二年多，琵琵妲妮兒爲一個發狂的退伍兵呌做亞爾勃荷蘭德（ＡlbertＨolland）的纒擾不清。他説琵琵是他從前的妻子，定要她回到她數年前抛棄的四個兒子的地方來。</p>
<p>他説琵琵早年和他結過婚的狂言，人家都知道了。二年前，琵琵接到許多情書，但她並不注意，因爲在好萊塢的每個著名的明星，常會遇到這種事的。於是荷蘭德徹夜不眠的到她家裏去，差不多没有一晚他不在她的聖達摩妮茄（ＳantaＭornica）的海濱墅處的天井中，等候機會重伸他的請求的。琵琵之一舉一動，彼莫不深知。卽琵琵到别的城市去，他也知道，雖然琵琵的行動，很是秘密，除了他家人之外，没有人知道，但荷蘭德終是跟着的。</p>
<p>後來荷蘭德被捕，他接受了琵琵的勸告，允許離開好萊塢，但不久他又來了。琵琵的丈夫彭里昂聽了他友人的話，把他寄託到養育所去，但没有多少時，他又逃出來了。</p>
<p>在一九三一年之十二月，琵琵與彭請求法庭審判荷蘭德，欲證明其瘋狂。審問時，此退伍兵甚形可憐，故仁慈之法官，判其終身入阿格南國家醫院。但最近他又到好萊塢來了，不知他怎樣逃出來的。他嘗寫信給琵琵，提到他的迫害，恐怕他的受創的心，使他報仇。因此，聖達摩妮茄的家裏有保鏢在着，警察正在嚴厲的追查荷蘭德的行蹤。琵琵和彭同意荷蘭德的爲變態的心理所控制之行動，不足深責，但他們深望其被捕，並且望他不能再出來，這一次是末一次的　浦。</p>

<p>Japanese Cavalry Unit Detours for Surprise Attack on Chaoyang</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Breaks Out in the Dadianzi Area</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dong Futing telegraphed to Beiping, stating that the Japanese, with 4,000 troops from both air and land forces, pressed upon us, launching seven or eight successive assaults, but ultimately failed. Our army, located west of Nanling in a low-lying area, faced the enemy from a higher position. To avoid unnecessary sacrifice, we have safely retreated to a new defense line in Beipiao, vowing to fight the enemy to the death. Our army entered the new defense line for strategic reasons, which is unrelated to the overall military situation, and so on. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that on the morning of the 22nd, the enemy army on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line divided into left and right wings, as well as a central force, and launched a fierce attack on our Nanling position, encircling it on three sides. The central force, led by the Japanese general Nishiyi himself, consisted of three armored vehicles, over ten tanks, two field artillery regiments, and a thousand infantrymen, directing and supervising the battle from the front lines. The left wing, led by Suzuki, included two infantry regiments, one mortar and one field artillery regiment, along with Cheng Guorui's troops, advancing from Liulongtai to attack our Sanbaoyingzi and Erguanying. The right wing, a mixed force of infantry and cavalry from the Eighth Division, advanced from Jinjiaosi, launching assaults with heavy artillery fire, supported by eight enemy aircraft bombing. Commander Dong also personally led his troops, deployed along key routes, fiercely retaliating with machine guns and hand grenades. Both sides engaged in intense combat throughout the day. The enemy army launched numerous assaults, with approximately 2,000 killed by our army. Currently, Commander Dong's forces, seeing the enemy's left wing fiercely attacking our rear in Sanbaoyingzi and Erguanying, aiming to sever the connection between Chaoyang and Nanling, have assembled their troops at the new defense line on the Chaoyang front, holding firm and awaiting reinforcements. (23rd Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Two battalions of Commander Dong's troops, who were defending Nanling, entered the new defense line in Beipiao on the night of the 22nd to avoid Japanese aircraft bombing. The Japanese side continued to attack Beipiao with air and land forces, as well as tank units. Our army is making every effort to resist. Simultaneously, Japanese cavalry, under the cover of aircraft, detoured through Chenggaoyingzi and Longtanshan to attack Chaoyang. Fierce fighting has broken out in Dadianzi, about twenty li outside Chaoyang. As of this morning, the Japanese have not succeeded. Our army is still holding firm in the strongholds of Beipiao, Chaoyang, and other places. The morale of the army is very high. In the fierce battles between Nanling and Beipiao in recent days, the Japanese army has suffered over 300 casualties. Our army shot down one enemy aircraft. Our losses are very small. The decisive battle will likely take place in the mountainous areas around Chaoyang and Chifeng. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd, one Japanese armored vehicle arrived at Chaoyang Temple, carrying over a thousand Japanese soldiers and a large amount of light and heavy equipment. After disembarking, the Japanese soldiers advanced towards Liulongtai, seemingly heading to Nanling to assist the Japanese army attacking Beipiao. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd, a regiment of the Sixth Division's troops, along with four artillery pieces and two large columns of vehicles, passed through Jinzhou from Shenyang and headed to the front lines of the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Road to strengthen their firepower and attack Beipiao. According to a telegram from Chaoyang on the 22nd, the artillery fire of the enemy army attacking Nanling was extremely fierce. Our army feigned retreat on the front lines, luring the enemy into narrow passes, engaging in a desperate bloody battle, and breaking through the enemy's encirclement on three sides, inflicting heavy casualties. We have completely destroyed the railway between Chaoyang Temple, Nanling, and Beipiao to prevent the enemy from utilizing it for their advance. The enemy has continued to reinforce the front with heavy troops, including over sixty trucks and three hundred civilian vehicles, attempting to capture Beipiao. We are currently consolidating our defense line between Beipiao and Nanling and will resist to the death, even if only one soldier and one bullet remain. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Our Main Force Concentrates in Beipiao</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde on the 23rd, citing a telegram from Commander Dong, states that our army in Nanling, fearing pressure from the enemy, concentrated its main force in Beipiao on the night of the 22nd for a decisive battle. The enemy continued to attack our army with land and air forces, as well as tanks. Our army is fighting bravely. The enemy cavalry detoured through Chenggaoyingzi and Longtanshan, launching a surprise attack on our Chaoyang position. Fierce fighting has begun in the Dadianzi area. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Japanese Cavalry Unit Advances Toward Lingnan</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that over a thousand cavalrymen of the Mizhake unit from Suizhong, under the cover of two aircraft, advanced towards Lingnan County on the 23rd. They were intercepted by Peng Zhenguo's Volunteer Army unit at Lishugoumen. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Chaoyang and Beipiao</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chaoyang, Beipiao, and other places have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing extensive damage. Post offices and telegraph offices in various locations have been completely destroyed. Personnel from the post and telegraph bureaus have moved into underground caves and are continuing to work as usual. Many civilians in Chaoyang and Beipiao have been killed by Japanese aircraft bombings, a truly tragic sight. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lingyuan Area Heavily Bombed</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that six enemy bomber aircraft flew to Lingnan and Lingyuan at noon on the 22nd and bombed them. The civilian houses in Lingnan County were extensively damaged. The straw sheds and other places near Lingyuan were heavily bombed. On the morning of the 23rd, large formations of enemy aircraft bombed Chaoyang and Jianping. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tang Yulin Will Depart to Take Command</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the tense situation at the front, Tang Yulin is scheduled to go to the front on the 23rd or 24th to command military operations. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Feng Zhanhai's Troops Engage in Fierce Battle with the Enemy</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kailu suddenly became critical yesterday. The Japanese army advanced northward from Liujiataizi</p>
<p>— Tang Yulin (National News Agency Photograph)</p>
<p>towards Kailu, engaging in fierce battle with Feng Zhanhai's troops at Sitaizi. The Japanese side transferred over 3,000 reinforcements from Dili Liao to advance towards Kailu, launching a general offensive. Over 300 Mongol bandits attacked Ganqihala Fort, north of Kailu, yesterday, but were routed by our army. Over 70 Mongol bandits were captured. (23rd Special Dispatch) (Beiping) A telegram from Kailu states that since the night of the 21st, the enemy has been attacking on multiple fronts with 5,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, over twenty armored vehicles, and over 3,000 Mongol bandits and puppet troops. On the 22nd, both sides engaged in fierce battle for a full day and night, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Enemy Advances on Nanling Make No Progress</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chaoyang at 0:50 PM on the 22nd states that the Japanese army launched seven successive assaults on Nanling starting in the morning. Each attack utilized both land and air forces, concentrating artillery fire to strike our positions. Our army remained unusually calm, waiting for the Japanese army to approach before using light and heavy machine guns and mortars to fire. Upon closer approach, we engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Simultaneously, our cavalry launched flanking attacks on the two wings of the Japanese army. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese army ultimately made no progress, suffering an estimated 300 to 400 casualties or more. Our army also suffered considerable casualties. A temporary truce has been declared. Fierce fighting resumed on the morning of the 22nd. There have been no changes to our army's positions. Furthermore, Japanese aircraft came to Chaoyang at 9:00 AM to drop bombs. After being fired upon by the garrison troops, they quickly flew away. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

It Is Rumored in the Yuguan Area That the Japanese Army Intends to Launch an Attack on Yuxi on the 25th, Primarily with Artillery. The Enemy Artillery Has Increased Compared to Previous Days. A Small Detachment of Field Artillery Also Arrived in Yuguan on the 21st, and Units That Arrived on the Same Day Previously Are Also in Reserve for Attacking Yuguan. We Have Increased Our Alertness.

<p>The Existence of Anti-Manchukuo Forces in Rehe Makes It Impossible to Restore Security. The Japanese Side Is Assisting in Their Suppression Based on the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. If the Anti-Manchukuo Forces Persist in the War, It Is Difficult to Guarantee That It Will Not Extend to North China. The Responsibility for Any Situation That Occurs Will Rest Entirely with the Chinese Side. (Nanjing) At 5:00 PM on the 23rd, Japanese Embassy Secretary Shinichi Uemura handed over an aide-mémoire to Foreign Minister Luo, containing three points, phrased quite absurdly. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately drafted a reply, vehemently refuting it and declaring that all responsibility should be borne by Japan. This reply was sent out late on the 23rd. The Japanese aide-mémoire and our reply are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Japanese Aide-Mémoire (1) The existence of Zhang Xueliang's army and other anti-Manchukuo forces in Rehe Province not only contradicts the sovereignty of Manchukuo but also makes it impossible to restore security in Rehe Province. Therefore, this time, Manchukuo is carrying out the suppression of bandits and remnants of soldiers and bandits in the province. The Japanese army, in accordance with the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, should cooperate with the Manchukuo army. Manchukuo has repeatedly demanded that the aforementioned Zhang Xueliang's army and others withdraw to within the Pass, but its demands have not been met. Therefore, as a result of carrying out the aforementioned suppression operation in Rehe Province, conflicts have arisen between our army, cooperating with the Manchukuo army, and Zhang Xueliang's army and other anti-Manchukuo forces. This is inevitable due to the continued presence of Zhang Xueliang's army and others in Rehe Province, and the responsibility for this should be borne by the Chinese side, which has not accepted Manchukuo's demands. (2) However, the actions of the Japanese army, which is cooperating with the Manchukuo army for the purpose of suppressing the aforementioned Rehe Province, are aimed at ensuring the security of the province and have no other intentions. In principle, they will only remain within the territory of Manchukuo. However, if Zhang Xueliang's army and other anti-Manchukuo forces insist on taking aggressive action, it is difficult to guarantee that the war will not extend to the North China region. If any situation occurs as a result of this, the responsibility rests entirely with the Chinese side. (3) As for the surrender of anti-Manchukuo forces, Manchukuo has always treated them with leniency. If Tang Yulin's army and others surrender at this time, they will still be treated leniently in accordance with the previous policy.</p>
<p>(2) Our Reply 1. Since September 18, 1931, Japan has occupied the three northeastern provinces with its military force and established a puppet organization. Now, disregarding everything, it is mobilizing a large number of troops to attack Rehe. Rehe is Chinese territory, the same as the three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory. The Chinese government's dispatch of troops to Rehe to defend against foreign military aggression is an exercise of its inherent sovereignty. The Japanese government's demand that Chinese troops withdraw from Rehe is clearly an expansion of the scope of aggression and a violation of China's territorial sovereignty. The Japanese government should absolutely bear full responsibility for attacking Rehe. As for the puppet organization in the eastern provinces, it is a puppet created single-handedly by Japan, a fact known to the whole world. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility for all its illegal actions. The Chinese government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese side regarding the so-called Japan-Manchukuo Protocol concluded by the puppet organization of the eastern provinces and does not recognize it. I will not repeat myself here. 2. Japan should bear full responsibility for attacking Rehe, as mentioned above. Not only does Japan want to seize Rehe, but it also claims that the actions of the Japanese army may extend to North China, which proves that the Japanese side is deliberately planning aggression and has no awareness of its wrongdoing. It is legitimate for the Chinese army to resist Japan and the army under Japanese command in Rehe or to carry out necessary defenses in other parts of Chinese territory. If Japanese military action encroaches upon North China, the Chinese army will certainly exercise its right to self-defense and protect its territory. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility for the situation that occurs as a result. 3. Tang Yulin, the Chairman of the Rehe Provincial Government, is a local Chinese military commander with the responsibility to defend the territory while commanding troops in Rehe. The Chinese government protests against the sections of the Japanese government's statement regarding Chairman Tang, which are considered intentionally insulting. (23rd Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) When the Japanese army began its invasion of Rehe, the Japanese Foreign Ministry suddenly submitted a memorandum to us, requesting the demarcation of a neutral zone inside and outside the Great Wall. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already rejected it. If this insidious plan were to be implemented, it would be tantamount to admitting that the three northeastern provinces do not belong to us. Japan could use this to deceive international public opinion, claiming that the invasion of Rehe is not aggression but merely an attempt to incorporate Rehe into the territory of the puppet organization. Furthermore, Japan's military strength is limited and it is actually unable to deploy troops along the Great Wall. If a neutral zone were established at this time, it could concentrate its forces on attacking Rehe and further divide our forces to achieve piecemeal defeats. Its intentions are extremely sinister, but its methods are too naive and shallow. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram) (Tokyo) The recent developments in the situation all indicate that Japan is unwilling to fight China. The Tokyo side believes that China is now trying to create a serious situation, forcing the League of Nations to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant and adopt sanctions against Japan. The Japanese side also said that Japan demanded that Chinese troops withdraw from Rehe and establish a neutral zone on the Great Wall. The Japanese side will notify the representatives of various countries that Japan is preparing to begin negotiations on the withdrawal of troops stationed in Shanhaiguan and that Japan does not intend to extend the war within the Great Wall. The Japanese side has no intention of withdrawing its diplomatic representatives in China, etc. All of this now indicates that Japan has no intention of declaring war on China. However, in the event that Chinese troops attack Pingjin, the Japanese army will send troops to reinforce them. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>The Future of the War</p>
<p>(1) The Invocation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>Since trampling on Manchuria and creating a puppet state, Japanese militarists have, under the guise of a special relationship, deliberately provoked challenges. Their actions are not merely aimed at monopolizing the economic markets of the Far East. Therefore, the Nineteen-Member Committee can no longer tolerate and allow Japan to tear up all international conventions and disregard [good faith] to dominate the world with military force. Although the draft resolution submitted by the Nineteen-Member Committee may not be adopted as originally proposed, the violent aggression of Japanese imperialism has since been recognized by the whole world. Our country, as the victim, if it can promptly strive for self-rescue, then the sanctions of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant—economic blockade against Japan—will not be difficult to realize.</p>
<p>Enlightened people in that country have long harbored a sense of caution. Even the boastful Osaka Asahi Shimbun understands that Japan is trapped in diplomatic isolation and that it is foolish to turn [the entire country into ruins]. Therefore, it advocates [avoiding] [war] and handling matters with caution. However, we have observed that in the past year and a half, Japanese public opinion has been completely dominated by militarist ideology. Consider the non-official opinion expressed by the Japanese Navy Department on February 22: [Withdrawal from the League of Nations is a foreseeable fact. … If anyone dares to impose an economic blockade, … our (Japan) navy is prepared to punish them with force. …]</p>
<p>[… The mandated administration of the South Pacific islands. Anyone who dares to deny the solemn sovereignty of (Japan) empire will be resolutely repelled. We will stake our lives to ensure that the South Pacific islands (Japan) maritime lifeline does not leave Japan's hands [… The Rehe issue is an internal matter of Manchukuo. …]</p>
<p>Such a statement is not only absurd but also a direct challenge to the world. Whether the League of Nations will reluctantly endure it or, failing to do so, issue a protest, it is unlikely to receive a satisfactory and reasonable response from Japan. However, our country, at this critical juncture, must not seek temporary comfort and must not rely on the assistance of foreign powers. In the face of the enemy's invasion, how can we rely on past treaties as the basis for reasoning?</p>
<p>The situation has reached this point. First, we must launch a complete national struggle, risking the blood of 400 million people to fight the brutal enemy. Second, Rehe is the shield and key to the northern gate of Pingjin, which needs no detailed discussion. Today, the enemy wants to use a puppet regime to rely on Rehe to gradually encroach on North China. For the sake of the country's future, the nation's survival, and the future recovery of the lost territories of the three northeastern provinces, we should devote the strength of the entire nation to defending Rehe. We should resolutely and fiercely strike back when the enemy comes to attack. We should also do our utmost to pursue the retreating enemy and recover our former territories. Third, in resisting, we are in a passive position. If the enemy does not attack, we are in a state of decline. In the future, we must reverse the situation, take advantage of the national resurgence, turn resistance into counter-offensive, and launch a war to recover the lost territories of the Northeast. We must officially send troops to punish the puppet state and initiate a prelude to war to punish the brutal actions of Japanese imperialism with force. (2) War of Self-Defense</p>
<p>After the draft resolution of the League of Nations Nineteen-Member Committee was submitted, the world has jointly recognized that the actions of the Japanese army in Manchuria are aggression. However, the Japanese army continues its aggression unabated. Although we have already achieved a [moral victory], if there is no strength to back it up, it will ultimately be in vain. Moreover, the justice of the international community must be based on the strength of the parties. Therefore, at this point, [reasoning] has come to an end. We should change our approach and stand up to fight with military force. Our country's weakness is not of one day's making. The enemy is emboldened to bully us because they believe we dare not speak of war. They are using threatening tactics everywhere, using a small number of troops to achieve maximum effect. If we were to fight with all our might, the crises lurking within Japan would also erupt one by one. We are forced to launch a [war] for self-defense. Domestically, it is enough to eliminate all our own contradictions, invigorate the declining spirit, unite disparate actions, make great sacrifices, and reverse the decline of our nation. Externally, other countries will see the results of our determined struggle and be able to abandon their previous contemptuous views, listen to the [justice] we advocate, and recover the lost territories of the Northeast. It is impossible to maintain world peace and justice without us paying a heavy price in iron and blood.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once the war against Japan begins, the entire country will naturally enter a state of war. The situation in the Far East market can also be imagined. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will find it impossible to stand idly by and watch the Sino-Japanese war. It is time to invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant for sanctions. Therefore, enlightened people in Japan also plan to avoid war. If it breaks out, Article 16 of the Covenant will follow with economic sanctions. Japan will experience the same predicament as Germany during the European War. Although its navy is deliberately making alarming statements to intimidate the powers and coerce our country, its outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature is an open secret. How can it be concealed?</p>
<p>Our country has lost more than 3.8 million square miles of territory. Is avenging this humiliation the same as aggression? Moreover, if we insist on fighting, the power to sanction violence will be in our hands. Inspiring world peace will also depend on whether our country can use iron and blood to shatter the delusion of Japanese militarism.</p>

<p>Special Committee's Continued Existence and Exercise of Authority Deemed Necessary</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee convened this afternoon and decided on the agenda for tomorrow's General Assembly. First, the chairman will report, followed by representatives from the three small nations and the Chinese representative. Finally, the report will be put to a vote. In addition to deciding on the General Assembly's agenda, the special committee also discussed other difficult issues. All committee members agreed that the special committee's continued existence and exercise of authority are necessary. (Central News Agency dispatch from Geneva, 3:30 AM, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to consider the report and recommendations of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee tomorrow. However, its position on the agenda is constantly changing and cannot be determined until the special committee meets today. Those who support the idea of not issuing arguments when the official meeting opens tomorrow are practically numerous. After Hymans' address tomorrow morning, the Chinese and Japanese representatives will speak in succession. Then, this report must be submitted to the League of Nations Political Committee. This procedure was recently invented by those who study formalities. The Political Committee, following the precedent set by the initial sessions of last year's League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly, may not differ much from the League of Nations Assembly itself. In any case, the committee can give those who wish to speak an opportunity to do so. Then, the Political Committee will amend the General Assembly to make a final passage. The impact of this procedure may extend the meeting beyond Friday. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd) (Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the League of Nations Assembly will reconvene on the 24th, and the report will be supported by all except Japan. According to the law, the report can take effect without the consent of the countries involved, so Japan's negative vote will be of no avail. The Assembly will not adjourn and will convene when necessary. Whether the special committee will continue to exist or a negotiating committee will be formed quickly will be decided at the Assembly on the 25th. We will raise the issue of Jehol after the report is passed and request effective measures to stop Japan's acts of aggression. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, in completing its report on the Sino-Japanese dispute to be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly, believes that its duties have come to an end. However, when it convenes tomorrow, it will see that its responsibilities and difficulties are far from over. During the Special Committee's meeting on Thursday, several difficulties may arise, such as the decision of the League of Nations Assembly's agenda, the completion of the organization of the negotiation committee, the discussion of what actions the League of Nations should take when the Jehol war breaks out, and the resolution of how to maintain the League of Nations Assembly so that it can handle the various developments after the report is passed. All are events that the Special Committee must deal with tomorrow. The Special Committee is currently exercising its judicial functions. It has already drafted its verdict in a secret meeting. Now, following the guidance of Chairman Hymans, it will not only announce the verdict but also accept the various events that occurred during the meeting. Hymans handles various matters in his capacity as chairman, and everyone is convinced and admires him greatly, believing that no one else can lead the committee's work. Chinese Chief Delegate Dr. Yen Hui-ching will speak before the report is passed, and the gist of his speech has already been drafted, but how to phrase it will depend on the extent of satisfaction he obtains when the Special Committee meets tomorrow. After Dr. Yen's speech, several countries that are not members of the Special Committee, such as Canada, may make some statements. However, Japanese Representative Matsuoka will probably speak only after the report is passed. It is estimated that Matsuoka's words will not go beyond the scope of the arguments made by the Japanese delegation yesterday, which are nothing more than refusing to revoke the recognition of ["Manchukuo"], declaring the Jehol incident to be an internal affair of ["Manchukuo"], and pointing out that the League of Nations should bear part of the responsibility for the current situation. The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee has slightly different opinions on how to continue to contact the situation. Some suggest that the League of Nations Assembly should continue to be convened at any time by the League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. Others advocate the establishment of another body, such as the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee. At the same time, others advocate that the structure of the report should be changed slightly so that the negotiating committee can meet as soon as possible, regardless of whether both parties accept the report. There are quite a few people who agree with the third theory above, because they feel that this method can obtain the cooperation of Russia and the United States in the future situation, which is considered to be the most serious scene since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict.

<p>Main Points of Assembly Speech</p>
<p>(Geneva) The main points of our country's Representative Yen's speech at tomorrow's League of Nations Assembly, in addition to those already detailed in the previous telegrams, will further clarify and reaffirm China's sovereignty in Manchuria, which is the cornerstone of consolidating international treaties and the League of Nations, and declare that the Chinese government is willing to accept the report and welcomes the participation of the United States and Russia in the negotiations. After Representative Yen's speech, Representative Koo may speak to explain the seriousness of the Jehol situation and ask the League of Nations to find ways to prevent the situation from escalating as soon as possible.

<p>Japanese Government's Final Decision</p>
<p>Steps to Deal with the League of Nations</p>
<p>Instructs Matsuoka to Firmly Reject Advice</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry held a leadership meeting today and decided on the final steps for the League of Nations Assembly to reconvene on the 24th. The content of the telegram to the Japanese delegation is as follows: (1) Matsuoka must answer Chairman Hymans' speech on the 24th with an absolutely tough attitude and cannot relax in the slightest. (2) When the report is put to a vote at the Assembly, oppose it with the greatest strength, and finally cast a negative vote and issue a declaration of non-cooperation. (3) Insist on proceeding with Article 15, Paragraph 5, while the delegation withdraws from Geneva and prepares to return home. (4) Finally, explain the reasons why Japan is severing ties with the League of Nations and prepare to formally notify the League of Nations of its withdrawal on March 1. (China United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet held a cabinet meeting this afternoon at the Prime Minister's official residence. Minister of War Araki reported on the Jehol war situation, and Foreign Minister Uchida proposed three draft instructions: (1) A written statement not accepting the recommendation. (2) Representative Matsuoka's declaration at the Assembly. (3) After the recommendation is established, what form should the proposal to sever ties with the League of Nations take? After careful discussion, the original drafts of the Foreign Ministry were approved. After the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Uchida entered the palace to request the Emperor's approval. A telegram was sent to Matsuoka Yosuke tonight, instructing him to act accordingly at tomorrow's Assembly. It is reported that the general outline of the content is as follows: (1) Japan has cooperated with the League of Nations every time in the past thirteen years to maintain world peace, and the League of Nations should pay attention to this point. (2) The international dispute in the Far East is not due to Japan's aggression, but to China's lack of internal governance. To solve the Far East problem, China's internal affairs must be unified. (3) The culture of the three northeastern provinces is different from that of Europe, and European political philosophy cannot be applied. Only by recognizing ["Manchukuo"] can peace in the Far East be maintained. (4) Japan absolutely cannot accept the League of Nations' recommendation. If the League of Nations passes the recommendation, Japan will not be able to cooperate with the League of Nations in the future. (5) Japan cannot be held responsible for any incidents that occur in the world regarding peace after the recommendation is passed. (China United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representative Matsuoka has decided to leave Geneva for The Hague and London on the 25th, and will cross the Atlantic from England to the United States around March 10th, staying for two or three weeks. He is scheduled to take the Asama Maru and arrive in Yokohama around late April. Representatives Nagaoka and Sato will also leave Geneva on the 25th and 26th. After the 27th, only Information Chief Yokoyama, Sakamoto, and Honno will remain in Geneva to sort out the remaining affairs. (United News dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The question of whether Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations is still undecided. However, it is reported that the Japanese Cabinet has decided to order the Japanese delegation in Geneva to retreat to London or Paris to await developments after the League of Nations passes the report of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee. One thing seems certain: Japan will reject the recommendation and vote against the report. Although there are differing opinions throughout Japan regarding withdrawal from the League of Nations, there is unanimous opposition to the report. According to the Japanese, Japan may have agreed to the recommendation of Manchurian autonomy a year ago, with China retaining sovereignty on the surface. However, there may have been doubts at first whether the recommendation of ["Manchukuo"] could be a satisfactory solution to the Manchurian issue. Since the agreement was concluded last September, these doubts have disappeared, it is said. As for the question of whether Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations, public opinion is clearly divided. Judging from the phenomenon, even if a decision to withdraw is made, it will not be realized until several weeks or several months after the report is passed. The reason for not withdrawing immediately is to avoid the appearance of being driven by a momentary impulse, and to bid farewell to the League of Nations in a friendly spirit.

<p>If an Embargo is Imposed on Both China and Japan Equally</p>
<p>It Would Only Encourage Japan's Belligerence</p>
<p>Britain Does Not Intend to Act Alone and Plans to Cooperate Internationally</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, a Chinese spokesperson commented on the matter of various countries currently discussing a ban on the transportation of arms to countries fighting in the Far East, saying that the Chinese government certainly agrees with the principle of a ban, but this principle cannot be applied to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan is currently the aggressor, while China is purely self-defensive. In addition, Japan has already prepared sufficient arms, while China has not prepared for war. If arms exports are banned and implemented equally for both China and Japan, then the powers are no less than assisting Japan's aggression in China. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd) (London) The British government is currently studying the possibility of taking international action to ban the transport of arms to the Far East. This matter is particularly simple in France, Britain, and Italy, requiring only the refusal to issue export passports. However, it is not so easy in the United States and other countries. The Cabinet approved the steps to be taken on the ban issue tonight and put forward suggestions for future actions, but it also resolved that Britain cannot act alone and must act jointly with other arms-exporting countries. During the House of Commons meeting today, former Cabinet member Samuel stated that he would question the government on February 27 as to whether it had consulted with other powers and autonomous regions on imposing a uniform ban on any warring country that the League of Nations condemned for abusing force in supplying it with arms. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of banning the transport of arms to the Far East, some people asked political figures about the British government's attitude. According to the answer, this matter should be decided by the League of Nations, and it must first determine who is the aggressor. Since the League of Nations has not made any decision on this matter, if the transport of arms is to be banned, it must be carried out simultaneously for both belligerent parties. However, Japan has factories that manufacture arms, while China does not. Under such circumstances, the result of banning the transport of arms will inevitably be contrary to what people generally hope for, and this ban must be carried out unanimously by all countries, and the United States must also agree to it. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Today, it was learned that various countries have not yet put forward any concrete proposals regarding banning the transport of arms to China and Japan, and the League of Nations does not have a structure for implementing an arms embargo. However, this embargo can be implemented by member states, and there have been no negotiations on this issue between various countries so far. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Large Quantities of British Arms Exported to the Far East</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of banning the export of arms to the Far East, an important message was published in this morning's newspapers, stating that [the recent export of arms to the Far East is not only enough to encourage the British arms industry but also greatly helps the British shipping industry]. The Daily Guide stated, [Since New Year's Day, a certain British factory has exported 36 million rounds of ammunition to the Far East, and another factory has exported 1,000 machine guns]. It is noted that Britain's total exports for the entire last year were only 13 million rounds of ammunition and 800 machine guns. ] The Daily Express also reported, [Vickers Armstrong factories are working three shifts a day and night to rush-manufacture ammunition for export to the Far East, and recently, not only China and Japan, but also the Siamese government has ordered large quantities of ammunition and machine guns from British factories]. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Liverpool correspondent of the ["Daily Telegraph"], arms destined for China are currently being loaded in Liverpool and other British ports. The exact amount of these arms is kept strictly secret, but it has been learned from official circles that a ship sailing to China yesterday was loaded with explosives. According to well-informed sources, there is no ban on arms exports, and explosives have often been loaded for export for some time, and the number has increased even more recently.

<p>(Moscow) Chairman Stalin of the Communist Party Central Executive Committee recently issued a book to the national army during the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, admonishing them to master modern military technology and prepare to reject invaders, saying that the Central Committee of the Communist Party requires all naval and land personnel to always remember that enemies are outside our borders, continue to arm, and prepare to display their executioners and extend the danger of entering Soviet territory. Army Commissioner Voroshilov also issued a notice, solemnly reiterating that there is currently a crisis of someone launching a new adventure of war against the Soviets, and instructed the Red Army to be prepared to defend the socialist motherland at any time. (National Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is now expected that when the newly appointed Soviet ambassador Zeleny arrives in Tokyo next month, negotiations will begin to organize a border committee composed of representatives from Japan, Russia, and ["Manchukuo"], whose task will be to demarcate the border and prevent border disputes. It is reported that the Soviet Union has agreed in principle to this measure. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>To Deal with Economic Sanctions from Various Countries</p>
<p>The Mandated Territory in the South Seas Will Not Be Abandoned</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Naval Ministry stated that Japan cannot accept the League of Nations' recommendations regarding the Manchurian dispute. The Japanese Navy is determined to adopt full plans to deal with the new situation. The economic sanctions against Japan advocated by the general public are inhumane and cruel actions, and the Japanese Navy will prepare to deal with such inhumane acts with force. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd) (Tokyo) The government notified the powers, stating that Japan will do its best to prevent our army in Jehol from extending to North China. From the Japanese perspective, this action shows that Japan does not want to go to war with China. At the same time, there is a saying that the border committee organized by representatives of Japan (["Manchukuo"] and Russia is expected to be realized soon, and the speaker indicates that Japan intends to reduce the danger of conflict with Russia. However, semi-official news stated that the Navy will never allow the abandonment of the islands under Japanese mandate and is prepared to take any steps it deems necessary when the League of Nations attempts to impose economic sanctions. This explanation serves as a warning, and the Naval Ministry believes that although Japan is eager to achieve a peaceful outcome in the current situation, it is also unwilling to be coerced. As for the ban on supplying arms, the general opinion of the Japanese is that this measure is beneficial and harmless, because Japan is a self-sufficient country, and banning the transport of arms will not cause Japan great inconvenience, but will only anger Japan.

<p>Japanese Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Currency Inflation and a Sharp Decline in Gold Reserves</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In mid-August of last year, banks in various provinces of Japan experienced difficulties, and the financial authorities reduced the loan interest rate from 4.2% to 3% to allow banks in various provinces to borrow at low interest rates to tide over the difficulties. Finance Minister Takahashi believed at the time that savings bureau deposits would increase by 200 million yen by the end of December last year. Unexpectedly, from August to the present, savings bureau deposits have decreased by more than 200 million yen. The difference between the two numbers has reached 400 million yen. As a result, the financial authorities felt great difficulty. In order to reduce unemployment, the Japanese government originally planned to spend approximately 226 million yen on various projects. However, after the savings bureau's deposits decreased, these huge sums of money could not be raised, and some of the valuable securities stored in the savings bureau had to be sold. Japan had to issue approximately 100 million yen in convertible notes to compensate for the budget deficit in 1933-34. The issuance of these convertible notes will inevitably cause currency inflation. The Japanese authorities are now working hard to prevent currency inflation, or at least to reduce it. If the savings bureau sells some of its valuable securities, then the authorities' efforts will be even more difficult. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Planning to Establish 300 Airfields Nationwide</p>
<p>Military Authorities Focus on Aircraft Manufacturing</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Under the slogan of the aircraft-saving country movement, to date, the hardworking masses across the country have been forced to donate 79 military aircraft. The forced aircraft-saving country movement has come to an end. Recently, it even organized the so-called [Imperial Aircraft Association] and planned to have the people across the country donate 300 airfields. Its first step, in Ueda City, has already begun, preparing to hold a grand donation movement at the end of April. In other Yamanashi Prefecture, under the leadership of the Fascist Youth League, it plans to build a large-scale airfield at the foot of Mount Fuji. Such so-called donation movements are entirely by military order, and are accelerating the deployment of a powerful air network across the country for use in world wars and suppressing internal unrest. (China United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan is now paying great attention to the manufacturing of aircraft. It is heard that Japan can now manufacture aircraft, and its exports can rival those of Qinxi countries. The authorities of the Navy and Army are paying attention to the announcement of aircraft manufacturing, and the Navy Ministry has established an aircraft manufacturing plant. Although Japan started aircraft manufacturing relatively late, it is heard that there has been considerable progress. From now on, the Japanese people need not be worried about the manufacturing of aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e19">Why are Japanese Americans Secretly Storing Arms? <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, among the Japanese expatriates in California, USA, there are various secret organizations carrying out anti-American movements. California American police have recently been paying close attention to the behavior and actions of Japanese expatriates. A few days ago, in a certain place in San Francisco, several Japanese expatriates, including Miyagi, were found to be secretly storing a large number of arms, with dozens of machine guns, hundreds of rifles, and countless bullets. The American police are paying close attention to this case and are vigorously searching for the people behind it and the content of the conspiracy. The Japanese Consul General in San Francisco was extremely alarmed upon hearing the news and has reportedly explained to the Governor of California several times, but the incident has not yet been resolved.

<p>(Nanjing) Li Liejun said that the purpose of his visit to Nanjing was to support the central government's active resistance against Japan and to hope to reform internal affairs so that the military and civilians could unite and rise up, and use their full strength to revitalize the country. Therefore, he submitted a letter of opinion as soon as he arrived in Nanjing, which has been carefully discussed. Regarding the national defense plan, most of the items are things that the responsible authorities originally planned to do, and are generally the same, and are already being actively planned and implemented. What is not completely the same is the reform of internal affairs. The case consists of three items, which are really a clear path to be followed in democratic countries. If they can be put into practice, then it will not be difficult to save the country and revitalize the country. It is still waiting for the Central Political Committee to discuss it in detail, or a resolution can be reached. As for resisting insults, some people in the country are quite worried that their weapons are not as good as those of enemy countries. In fact, the victory or defeat of a war depends first on national spirit and right and wrong. The reason why countries all over the world are now jointly sanctioning Japan is that they are wrong and we are right. The reason why the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army and other armies were able to crush the strong enemy in the Battle of Shanghai was because of the national spirit. Chairman Chiang is currently suppressing bandits at the front and will soon return to Nanjing to preside over the meeting. Chairman Feng will also arrive in Nanjing soon to discuss major plans together. The central government is becoming more consolidated, and the intelligence of the people can gradually be expected to be realized. I will go to Shanghai in a few days to pack up my family affairs and then come to Nanjing again. (Special Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the report of the Nineteen-Nation Committee was published, Japan has actually threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations, and at the same time intimidated us by blockading our seaports. On the one hand, it is actively preparing for a general offensive on Jehol. According to a telegram on the 23rd, the Jehol War officially began on the 20th, and a major war is about to break out. If the Japanese bandits are barbaric and disregard world peace, and actually implement a blockade of our seaports, what strategy should our country adopt? A certain military expert said that the central government has already planned this matter thoroughly. If China and Japan declare war, Japan will use its superior navy to blockade our seaports and cut off our supplies. However, the result will inevitably lead to the intervention of the powers and repeat the tragedy of the Second World War. In my observation, as a result of the war, Japan will become the post-war Germany, which is the best opportunity for our country to rise. Some people suspect that our country will become the Belgium of the war. This is really an overestimation of the current international situation. As for the steps and strategies that our country will take, the central government has a whole plan, which concerns military secrets and cannot be told. (Special Telegram, 23rd)</p>

The bureau considered that the place violated the postal regulations and contradicted the government's order to suspend the mailing of mail from the Northeast.

<p>And a Telegram to the Generals at the Front</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke sent a telegram on the 23rd to various circles in Jehol and Zhang Xueliang, etc., expressing his willingness to encourage the people and act as a backing. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) To all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and education, and all the people of Jehol: Having respectfully read your telegram, we understand your feelings. The violent Japanese are greedy and insatiable. Having already obtained Liaodong, they now covet Jehol. Is there any place that is not our territory, yet they are allowed to trample upon it? Is there any one who is not our citizen, yet they are allowed to be slaughtered? Now, the central government has made a firm resolution, and the generals deeply understand the great cause, their spirit is strong and martial, and victory lies in harmony. To pull us out of the fire and water and restore our rivers and mountains depends on this one action. As long as our elders and brothers cry out, how dare we not encourage the people and act as a backing? I hereby reply to your telegram. Do not let your hearts hang in suspense. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, with seal. (2) To Acting Chairman Zhang of the Beiping Military Affairs Commission, and to the generals at the front: Having respectfully read your telegram, we understand your situation. Japan has been plotting against us with all its national strength for many years. They have abandoned faith and betrayed their neighbors, and indulged in cruelty to the people. They disregard justice and only rely on power. Like a fire burning the prairie, they cannot be approached. The generals feel the danger of being in a collapsing house and the pain of biting their own navels. They vow to lead the three armies and fight them to the end. It is said, "Victory lies in harmony, one strike exhausts the energy." It is an ancient teaching to clarify shame and teach war in order to kill the enemy. If evil is prolonged, it will eventually reach its end. Those who hold the winning calculation will eventually belong to us. Looking north at the clouds on the border, we await the good news of victory. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, with seal. (23rd, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The Military Authorities in Beiping Have Not Received</p>
<p>The So-Called Final Ultimatum</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is generally believed here that the so-called Japanese side will present a final ultimatum is entirely a formality, because the ultimatum has not yet been presented, and the war has already broken out. It is said that the ultimatum could have been delivered this afternoon, but it has not been received so far. Tonight, the Chinese authorities declared that they have not yet seen the so-called "ultimatum," and even Japanese officials said they knew nothing about it. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side is spreading propaganda that the puppet organization will deliver a so-called final ultimatum to us, demanding the withdrawal of troops stationed in Jehol Province within a time limit, otherwise it will be resolved by force. According to official sources, as of noon today, no documents have been received from any puppet organization. Even if they were received, they would be ignored. (23rd, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Japanese sources, the ultimatum that Japan is about to present will likely only be presented orally in Nanjing, which is already sufficient and does not need to be presented in Beiping again, because Zhang Xueliang has repeatedly stated that his actions are in accordance with the instructions of the central government. (23rd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Residents in Tianjin Organize a Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>Security in the Japanese Concession is Tightened</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military authorities officially announced on the 23rd that because the 1,500 stationed troops are insufficient, they have decided to select 1,500 veterans and organize them into a reserve army, and have agreed to prepare 100,000 sacks within three days. After 8 p.m. on the 23rd, armed plainclothes soldiers were dispatched to guard all intersections between China and Japan. At all intersections within the Japanese concession, armed soldiers were dispatched to patrol with rifles and bayonets. The Japanese police station has decided to install iron fences at all intersections to prevent emergencies. Due to widespread rumors, the British and French concessions are also secretly on alert. It is rumored that Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, will be ordered to go to Yuguan to command the attack on Jehol. (23rd, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation here is tense, like a powder keg. An incident seen from a Reuters window this morning is indicative of this. This morning, some infantry from the Japanese embassy guard were conducting a mock attack in front of Chinese civilians outside the boundary of 交民巷. The Chinese people now openly regard the Japanese as enemies, and their inner anger is evident. Fortunately, a squadron of Chinese cavalry patrolling the streets passed by and remained calm. If they had been slightly less patient, it would have inevitably caused trouble. The situation in Tianjin is similar. It is reported that Nakamura, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, has mobilized 1,500 reservists, which makes the number of Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin twice what it was before. (23rd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy forces currently have more than 900 soldiers in Tanggu, 1,500 in Tianjin, and 500 in the expatriate volunteer army. There are 24 tanks and 5 armored vehicles in Tianjin. (23rd, special dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army officially invaded Jehol, in addition to strictly censoring news within their own country to prevent publication of any news that might be detrimental to their cause, they have also forbidden journalists of any nationality from going to the front lines of Kailu and Chaoyang Temple to report on their military operations, in order to strictly maintain military secrets. All news is disseminated by their own propaganda. Therefore, there have been rumors yesterday and today that Nanling and Beipiao have been occupied. However, the most noteworthy thing is that this rumor was once published in the newspapers in Shenyang as early as the 17th of this month, as if it were true.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the trade plan with Russia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry are conducting research. A person in charge of the Ministry of Industry stated that Minister Chen advocated adopting the principle of "government supervision and commercial operation," and plans to establish a trade organization for trade with Russia, invested by merchants and the public, but subject to government regulation and supervision. This method can correct the failures of past trade. This opinion has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and still needs to be decided by the Central Political Conference.

Even during the period of the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the amount imported into Russia was still considerable. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry investigated that the value of tea imported into Russia last year was more than 60 million, and the supply still could not meet the demand. Russian merchants had no choice but to seek it from the Caucasus and Japan, but the quality of tea from the Caucasus and Japan was poor. According to an official from the Ministry of Industry, after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, our country's tea exports to Russia will definitely be prosperous. This year, the minimum amount can be increased from 60 million to more than 70 million. (21st, special dispatch)</p>
<p>The Lawyers Association on the Gu Case</p>
<p>Requests a Change of Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Is Currently Collecting All Materials</p>
<p>Preparing to Draft an Indictment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of Gu Zhutong illegally shooting Liu Yusheng, the National Lawyers Association, in order to safeguard the law and protect human rights, has filed a complaint with the judicial authorities, requesting that Gu Zhutong, who abused his power and illegally killed people, be prosecuted according to law. Liu Yangmin, a standing committee member of the association, said that they are currently collecting all materials and preparing to draft an indictment. The preliminary issue in this case is to request a change of jurisdiction, because according to the location of the defendant and the place where the crime was committed, the complaint should be filed with the Zhenjiang District Court. However, Gu is the highest administrative officer of Jiangsu Province, and there is a fear that he may use his power to interfere with the judiciary. Therefore, according to law, a change of jurisdiction is requested. After the association applies, the Zhenjiang District Court will submit a report to the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, who will forward it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval, and then ask the Supreme Court to designate it. After the association waits for the designated jurisdiction, it will file a complaint with the court, requesting the prosecutor to accept it and file a public prosecution according to law, to seek redress for Liu Yusheng.

Furthermore, Gansu Province borders Mongolia and Xinjiang, and border defense is of utmost importance. To weather these difficulties and serve as a pillar of support, we rely on capable and virtuous individuals.

<p>Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 23rd: It was learned today that a serious incident may occur at the Disarmament Conference because the German representative objected to the French proposal, stating that it was aimed at the German National Defense Force. Furthermore, the German proposal to first decide on the abolition of offensive weapons and then decide on the principles of army standards was deemed unfeasible by the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, causing further distress to the German representative. (Editor's note: Last Friday, during the opening of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, the French representative and the German representative engaged in heated debate over the issue of Germany's "secret army", each refusing to yield. The French representative, Gude, stated that certain countries have certain groups that, although legal, can promote military spirit. The German representative, Nadolni, did not approve of the standardization of the army in his reply, strongly refuting the accusations against Germany without showing any weakness. Subsequently, French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Peng Gu held lengthy talks on the matter in Paris. The German representative, Nadolni, also went to Berlin to consult with the government. Now, Peng Gu and Nadolni have both returned to Geneva.)</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 23rd: The German representative to the Disarmament Conference, Nadolni, had a dispute with Henderson because Henderson opposed the German proposal to first discuss the abolition of offensive weapons and then address the issue of unifying the army system. This matter was hotly debated by representatives from various countries until late at night. The German representative sent a letter to Henderson last night, expressing his willingness to accommodate everything as long as it did not involve matters of principle.</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 23rd: After an hour of talks between the German representative and Henderson this afternoon, the dispute that occurred in the General Committee last night was peacefully resolved. Henderson issued a statement clarifying that he inadvertently failed to consider Ambassador Nadolni's second request to speak, so the German representative will be at the top of the list of speakers at today's General Committee meeting.</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 23rd: The Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference, which is trying to find a solution for European countries to agree on a non-aggression pact, is now at an impasse. The reason is that Germany fears that the newly established political convention is not sufficient to compensate for the guarantees of Locarno.

<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 22nd: In today's General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, German representative Nadolni delivered a speech commenting on the French plan to unify the European army system, which attracted great attention from the members. Nadolni stated that any system that seeks to guarantee the security of all countries must be based on reducing the armaments of strong countries and seeking a balance of armaments, and then devise various plans to make all forces defensive in nature. Therefore, Germany believes that special attention must be paid to the following points: Firstly, the distinction between defensive and offensive nature is not as important in military systems as in armaments. Therefore, the most important thing is to abolish offensive weapons such as mobile artillery, tanks, and bomber aircraft. Secondly, regarding the issue of personnel in the army, it is not about adopting any specific recruitment system, but about greatly reducing the number of soldiers. On this level, colonial troops must be incorporated into the national army. Germany is currently prepared to discuss the French plan, but only after the aforementioned issues have been satisfactorily resolved. Therefore, he specifically summarized Germany's views on disarmament and proposed a resolution, which, in addition to elaborating on the aforementioned issues, proposed that the General Committee should consider the principles of abolishing all offensive weapons and restricting combat materials before discussing the French proposal to unify the military system, and instruct the Military Strength Committee to formulate regulations for reducing the number of land forces and balancing military strength in accordance with the principles of the Hoover Plan, and submit a report to the General Committee within a specified period.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in today's Aviation Expert Committee, French Air Force Chief Gude summarized a plan to establish an international airline to take over existing commercial aviation routes and be supervised by the League of Nations, but few other members agreed. The Dutch representative, Lottgen, stated that it is only necessary to formulate appropriate regulations for commercial aviation, which will be as effective as the French plan in preventing commercial aircraft from being converted for military use.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from New York on the 23rd: Newly elected President Roosevelt recently announced that Davis will remain as the chief representative of the United States at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, but also stated that he wants to distinguish the issue of disarmament from the issue of economics.

<p>Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 22nd: Elected President Roosevelt's appointment of Hull as Secretary of State and Woodin as Secretary of the Treasury has been celebrated by key figures in the Democratic Party, and even independent Republicans have praised it. This is enough to show that Roosevelt can win the hearts of the people. The House of Representatives has followed the Senate in voting to grant Roosevelt the power to reorganize the government and act expediently in order to fulfill his promise to reduce national spending by 25%. The House of Representatives has approved an amendment to the Treasury and Postal Service Appropriation Act, allowing the President to arbitrarily change various bureaus, which can only be stopped if two-thirds of both houses of Congress object. It is expected that Hoover will also agree to this.</p>

The prepared cabinet list is as follows: Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Treasury Woodin, Secretary of War the Governor of Utah, Dunn, Secretary of the Navy Senator Swanson, Attorney General (similar to the Minister of Justice) Senator Walsh, Postmaster General Faley, Secretary of the Interior Ickes (a famous Republican leader), Secretary of Agriculture Tomoyan, Secretary of Commerce Rupp, and Secretary of Labor the socialist Ms. Pangins. Note that there are two Republicans in the cabinet, as the progressive faction of that party supported Roosevelt in the election, so they are being rewarded.</p>

He demanded that the United States Navy must be expanded to meet the strength allowed by the treaty, and must be expanded immediately so that the national defense forces can quickly reach the position allowed by the treaty. To prevent the effectiveness of the Navy from being reduced again, he will propose a bill in the next Congress to allocate 63 million yuan annually specifically for shipbuilding expenses.</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from Vienna on the 22nd: The arms case, from the point of view of direct action, can be considered to be over, but it is expected that the impact of this matter on Austria will be far-reaching. The Austrian government now feels that it has been insulted by the dispatches from Britain and France. According to astute observers, the Austrian government may not last another month. Its position has been weakened by the arms case, and it is now facing severe opposition to the contract signed between the Austrian Trust Company and foreign creditors on January 10th of this year, and the Lausanne Treaty. It seems that the most recent impact of the dispatches from Britain and France is to consolidate the influence of Germany and Italy in Austria. People here are now freely expressing their opinions, saying that the number of Austrian loans provided by the League of Nations that France has assumed will be replaced by Germany. Vienna newspapers also carry news that German Chancellor Hitler has agreed to lend money to Austria, but on the condition that elections are held immediately and a mixed government is formed by the Christian Social Party and the National Socialist Party. The widespread rumor that a large amount of armaments from Czechoslovakia was transported to Yugoslavia via Austria, and the official admission of this fact, has also aroused public opposition.</p>

At the same time, British Ambassador Lindsay is currently consulting with Roosevelt and the new Secretary of State Hull. Today, the British House of Commons asked British Prime Minister MacDonald whether there was a way for the British Prime Minister to go to the United States to negotiate war debts. MacDonald replied in very clear terms that talks will resume immediately. Before the talks have a result, there can be no arrangements regarding procedures, but the British government will devote itself to the future economic conference in order to reduce general tax rates.</p>

<p>National News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 22nd: The US House Coinage Committee decided yesterday to shelve all currency reform plans, but due to the activities of the faction advocating higher silver prices, it reconsidered today and submitted the Sowers Act, as amended by the subcommittee, to the House of Representatives. The act stipulates that the Treasury Department is authorized to purchase a total of US$250 million worth of silver, with the silver price between 40 and 60 cents per ounce. The committee has requested the House Rules Committee to put it on the agenda so that it can be voted on in this Congress. The purpose of this case is not to inflate currency but to raise silver prices, so the amount of silver purchased is limited. It is also heard that the main motivation for raising silver prices is to increase China's purchasing power for American goods, thereby promoting trade with China.</p>
<h3 id="e73">China's Representative Makes Another Statement to Japan Six <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth</p>
<p>The Japanese representative also stated, "[China's current center embodies] Sovietism, thus posing a major crisis for the Far East." They further stated, "The reason this movement hasn't progressed faster is due to Japan's existence. At the very least, Soviet Russia respects Japan. If Japan were to leave, the red tide would engulf the Yangtze River basin immediately." They also claimed, "In short, Japan's current position is a solitary struggle to save the Far East from peril. The fact that Soviet Russia remains outside the League of Nations further exacerbates Japan's difficulties." Furthermore, they stated, "We have now reached a critical juncture for the nation's survival. The restoration of peace and order in the Far East is naturally not the concern of outsiders. Japan's past history has been praised by all. Therefore, Japan's knowledge of Far Eastern affairs, its methods for handling them, and its understanding of the other parties involved should be deeply trusted without question." From the above, it seems one can deduce Japan's profound fear of the spread of Sovietism. However, this is far from the truth. The Japanese are raising these alarmist claims merely as a convenient argument. We can see this from Japan's decision to implement its plan to militarily occupy Manchuria while China was fully engaged in military and financial efforts to eradicate the Red bandits in the Yangtze River region.</p>
<p>Although Japan has obstructed China's determination to eliminate the communist rebellion, China has still achieved remarkable success. General Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, has submitted a detailed report to the National Government on the achievements in bandit suppression since April. The government, on one hand, employs military force, and on the other hand, uses political methods, advancing on both fronts simultaneously. Therefore, the former bandit areas have now been restored to their original state.</p>
<p>In fact, from another part of the Japanese representative's speech, one can see that they themselves are not entirely convinced of Soviet Russia's potential intentions. The Japanese representative stated, "Soviet Russia has a considerable understanding of the Manchurian problem." They also said, "However, what we should be grateful to Soviet Russia for is that we not only need not fear the outbreak of war but also have a great opportunity to establish a peaceful understanding with each other." Not only that, but the Japanese representative even raised the possibility of a Japanese-Russian alliance as a kind of threat, saying, "If we can establish a firm agreement with Soviet Russia, regardless of anything else, then what will the situation be like afterward?" Isn't this something to be greatly concerned about?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Japanese representative's policy is essentially a policy of intimidation towards all nations. However, even though they have violated their sacred promises, they can still leave fully satisfied. Consider their statement, "The Japanese government's actions, when judged under the League of Nations Covenant, should enjoy flexibility. This is something we should all recognize in common sense."</p>
<p>However, the principles on which the League of Nations is based must have universal applicability if we hope it can effectively serve world peace. It must be understood that the League of Nations Covenant is essentially the constitution of the world. Therefore, its interpretation should also be consistent. No matter how complex the situation of a particular case, the framework of the Covenant must not be damaged. If we create valid exceptions, then the nature of the issue itself is already an exception, and the complexity or difficulty of any issue is merely a matter of degree. If the League of Nations' primary foundation cannot be relied upon as a pillar of world justice and peace, then the guarantee of peace that the nations of the world have acquired at great cost and nurtured with their blood and sweat for ten years is likely not truly reliable.</p>
<p>The Japanese representative's statement that "the whole world is constantly changing" may indeed have some truth to it. However, with respect to the sanctity of the principles of the League of Nations, we can only solemnly tell the Japanese representative that any change or correction should not arise from violating international peace charters but should arise from complete respect for these charters. The peace of the whole world is our most sacred aspiration. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e74">Liu E'qing's Interpellation Case <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Disciplinary Cases Versus Impeachment Cases</p>
<p>The Difference Between Ten and One Hundred</p>
<p>Why Are Many Impeached Officials Delaying Execution?</p>
<p>Four Doubts About the Facts of Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>Beijing News: The Control Yuan, based on a written interpellation submitted by Control Commissioner Liu E'qing regarding cases of officials at all levels being impeached for violating the law and dereliction of duty, with few disciplinary agencies executing the punishments, immediately forwarded the interpellation to the National Government for review and implementation. The original text of the submission is as follows:</p>
<p>"[Regarding forwarding an interpellation: According to a written submission from Control Commissioner Liu E'qing, since the establishment of this Yuan, we have impeached officials at all levels who have violated the law and derelicted their duties. However, the powers stipulated by the Yuan's laws are limited to impeachment. As for adopting strict punishments to thoroughly eliminate corruption and improve the efficiency of political renewal, thereby fulfilling the purpose of supervisory powers, this depends entirely on the disciplinary agencies. Since the successive establishment of the Central Disciplinary Committee for Civil Servants and the Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials, the commissioners of this Yuan have been earnestly speaking out, believing that it would not be difficult to achieve the aforementioned aspirations. However, according to the recent statistics of this Yuan, the ratio of disciplinary cases to impeachment cases has become a difference between ten and one hundred. Among these cases, there are more than twenty cases impeaching political officials, yet no clear disciplinary measures have been determined, leading to criticism from the public, who claim that the supervisory agencies are equivalent to being set up in vain. The commissioners are also constantly troubled day and night, feeling fearful of dereliction of duty. Article 12 of the Impeachment Law states that if a disciplinary agency delays or suppresses a transferred case, the Control Yuan may interpellate. The commissioner hereby requests an interpellation in accordance with this law. In the past, during the imperial era, the law for ministers was used to instruct lesser officials to be incorruptible. Today's political officials are equivalent to the grand ministers and frontier officials of the past. If political officials are unlawful, yet ordinary civil servants are held responsible for being incorruptible, this is unfair according to legal principles. If the law is not enforced on powerful individuals, it is a sign of historical decline and disorder. If punishments are not strict on those close to power, it is a sign of collapsing discipline. If no impeached political official fails to avoid disciplinary measures, then the commissioners are merely holding the bamboo slips of history and accompanying the meals at the steps of the palace. How could they be compared to Zhang Gang's chariot, buried together in the capital? What can be said about the constant rule of national law? This is the first thing that greatly confuses the commissioner. The establishment of the Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials has been several months, yet the cases submitted by this Yuan are reportedly still under investigation or in the process of notifying the impeached individuals to submit their appeals. The cases impeached by this Yuan are inherently different in nature from those prosecuted by the courts. These procedures are already feared to be obstructive and inappropriate. Even if investigation and defense are deemed indispensable, the impeached cases have already been delayed for a long time. People have changed, and evidence has disappeared, like chariot tracks that have already passed, asking those on the road. The mud and snow have already been buried, investigating at the inns. How can it not be different? As for the impeached individuals, they may have stumbled due to other reasons, or they may have been promoted through connections, drifting like Hong Qiao, changing their names like Zhang Lu, or embellishing massacres as meritorious service in suppressing bandits, boasting of extortion as effective fundraising, manipulating documents while also bending the law, dreaming of corpses while also obtaining official positions. These situations are truly impossible to investigate and impossible to defend. The cases impeached by this Yuan are thus delayed repeatedly, and their effectiveness is completely lost. This is the second thing that greatly confuses the commissioner. Political officials bear the responsibility of being linked to the political situation. Appointments and dismissals have an impact on the current situation. This may be a general reason for delaying disciplinary measures. Furthermore, the current situation in various places is still precarious, and the joint rule of military and civilians has long become an intertwined situation. The central government is cautious in its actions, naturally having other reasons of its own. However, the commissioners, after comprehensively reviewing this internal situation, feel that it is unreasonable. Political officials, especially those related to the current political situation, should first rectify themselves and their subordinates. If they are ignorant of this principle and dare to violate the law and derelict their duties, then the central government enforcing the law to hold them accountable is a fundamental principle of establishing governance and employing people. Why should there be any considerations? In the past, during the era of warlords, local leaders held military power and had the constitution in their mouths. However, once a clear order was issued to condemn them, they still did not dare to not leave their posts in a simple carriage, submitting themselves for punishment. If today, there is still concern about disregarding the law and resisting orders, would this not undermine authority? Furthermore, the most severe punishment under the Disciplinary Law is merely dismissal from office. There is no execution in the marketplace, and there is no humiliation of being brought to court. What fears or hesitations prevent a clear disciplinary measure from being issued? This is the third thing that greatly confuses the commissioner. Since the national crisis, the National Government has relocated, and governance has lost its normal course. Corrupt officials have taken advantage of the situation, to the extent that it is shocking to hear. It is thought that the central government, with the national crisis at hand, aware of the duties of sparrows building nests and concerned about the plight of fish in the depths and birds in the thickets, is striving for broad tolerance, hoping to achieve a comprehensive effect. However, this intention is too circuitous and not aligned with the law. The failure of a nation is inherently due to corrupt officials. If all officials do not correct themselves, punishments are akin to tattooing. It is deeply believed that the national crisis arose from greedy and degenerate individuals. In the past, when the disaster of floods was imminent, it was calmed with four executions. When the crow did not fly at the national gate, it was shot down with one arrow. According to historical records, there were only instances of rectifying discipline to face the national crisis, and there were no instances of abandoning discipline due to the national crisis. This is the fourth thing that greatly confuses the commissioner. Regarding the four points above, whether they are the reasons for delaying and suppressing the cases of impeached political officials, the commissioner has repeatedly deliberated and is greatly puzzled. Knowing that disciplinary powers do not belong to this Yuan, how dare we presume to interfere? However, for the sake of national law and the responsibility of speech, having the power to interpellate according to law, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we request that this be forwarded and instructed to be reviewed and replied to by the Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials." Based on this, it is appropriate to forward this to be reviewed and implemented in accordance with the law. Respectfully submitted to Lin, Chairman of the National Government.]"</p>

<h3 id="e81">City Federation Advocates Implementing Unified Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>| Letter to President Song Dai and Appeal to Citizens |</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday, for the sake of implementing unified resistance against Japan, sent a special telegram to Song Dai, President of the Executive Yuan, and issued an appeal to all citizens. The original texts are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing, Hon. Song Dai, President of the Executive Yuan,</p>
<p>Ever since the Japanese army invaded and occupied the three northeastern provinces on September 18th of the year before last, due to the non-resistance of the border defense officials, the territories have been lost and have not yet been recovered. How painful is this to the people! However, in terms of diplomacy, through your efforts to coordinate beforehand and respond to emergencies, strategizing and assisting the diplomatic authorities in appealing to the League of Nations, after seventeen months of effort, the draft report of the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen has been obtained and will soon be passed by the General Assembly. Although the suggestions may not be entirely to our liking, with this result, diplomacy cannot be said to be unsuccessful. Because the Japanese military action in the three northeastern provinces is not legitimate self-defense, our country's territorial sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces is recognized by all countries, and the people's boycott of Japanese goods is a retaliation against Japan's illegal force, this has become an ironclad case. The Japanese soldiers, with a rubber stamp in hand, do not reflect on their past mistakes and are again plotting to invade Jehol. Knowing that war is ultimately inevitable, you spared no effort in traveling long distances, flying to Beiping day and night, and rushing to Jehol to encourage military morale and plan for war expenses, representing the central government in announcing both internally and externally. The Japanese were thus enraged, and the world took notice. This is the time when our country is turning from adversity to prosperity, and the people have a reason to resist Japan. How uplifted are the citizens of Shanghai! However, since Japan is mobilizing the military and financial resources of the entire country to come, how can we not have wartime controls to defend ourselves? As the head of the Executive Yuan, how can you unite all departments into one, issuing orders that are carried out, avoiding mistakes in military opportunities, and protecting the country? This must already be clear in your mind, and there is no need for the people to worry. However, there are some things that I cannot help but say. The people's supply is naturally a duty that should be fulfilled, and rapid and free transportation is especially what the people earnestly pray for. Because in a war against Japan, the government and the people are one body, and it is not easy to clearly distinguish between them. If transportation is delayed even slightly, it will most easily delay military opportunities. This is one. Regarding foreign trade, our country has always been freely operated by the people. The latest modern policy has adopted state-owned enterprises, and various countries every time adopt intervention methods during wartime, precisely to prevent providing resources to the enemy and to limit the people's unnecessary consumption. Please find ways to implement this. This is two. In your speech to reporters on February 22nd, you said that people's organizations are too complex, which reduces the concentration of strength. This is truly insightful. However, on the one hand, mass organizations should strive for unified wartime organization, and on the other hand, the government must also be in close contact with such organizations, providing convenience and information, so that it can be like the body directing the arm and the arm directing the finger, without any hindrance. This is three. If we can unite and implement wartime controls, the Japanese army within our country will be insufficient to drive away. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping that you will take it into consideration. The Shanghai Citizens' Federation respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Appeal to Citizens:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation Appeals to All Citizens to Implement Unified Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>Since the draft report of the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen was published, although it still needs to be passed by the General Assembly, Japan's invasion of our country, with the three northeastern provinces being our country's territory, has been recognized by the world. Therefore, recovering our territory is the sole responsibility of our people. However, our people, in this time of national survival crisis, have not yet completely eradicated the bad habits of being polite. They are strict with others and lenient with themselves, strict with the government and lenient with themselves. The government's resistance against Japan has already progressed from declarations, reports, talks, and telegrams to burying its head in practical work. President Song Dai's recent words and actions can be seen as evidence of this. Although the transportation authorities have not yet regarded supplies for resisting Japan as related to military opportunities and transported them as quickly as possible, they will soon be able to implement wartime controls for military needs. However, no matter how the people's movement to resist Japan progresses, the construction of aircraft is indeed an essential tool for resisting Japan's air defense. However, this cannot be achieved by simply naming planes or making pledges on paper. Even if there are funds, due to the limitations of time and space, it cannot be achieved overnight. Since Japan's military action against Jehol is already in full swing, the lesser of two evils and the more urgent of two matters should be chosen. Therefore, providing funds to support the anti-Japanese forces on the Jehol border is the most important thing to do today. However, there are many anti-Japanese fundraising organizations established in Shanghai, which not only disperses efforts and divides energy but also makes it impossible for donors to know where to contribute. The association believes that the citizens of Shanghai as the leaders of China, should immediately adopt wartime controls to strengthen their real strength and benefit military opportunities, avoiding delaying the country. Therefore, we present several matters for your information: (1) The citizens of Shanghai should immediately establish a wartime organization and be directed by this organization as a whole. (2) All anti-Japanese fundraising organizations should immediately merge into one and be governed by this wartime organization as a whole. (3) All donations should strive to correct the previous shortcomings of relying solely on overseas Chinese and small and medium-sized citizens. (4) All citizens should reduce clothing, food, housing, transportation, electricity, telephones, etc. Whatever can be saved should be saved. During the European War, the citizens of Shanghai should remember the circumstances of Westerners saving electricity. (5) We ask the government to quickly implement a policy of controlling foreign trade in order to facilitate distinguishing needs. (6) All who want to buy necessary goods should buy them from stores that have proof of having no Japanese goods, and they should especially buy domestic goods and buy them from domestic goods companies. (7) We hope that all citizens will actively engage in production and actively reduce non-productive behavior. It is best if labor disputes, rent disputes, and various economic relations can maintain the status quo. Otherwise, the interests of the majority should be sought. Fellow citizens of Shanghai, now is a time of crisis for survival! Only with a country can there be a home, and only with territory can there be benefits. If we continue to wait and see, compete for petty gains, and seek private interests, when the country is shattered, those who think they are prosperous will be the first to suffer. We hope that the leaders of the city will rise up and initiate this. This association will follow behind them, holding the reins to follow. We specially draft this letter to present this idea. We respectfully ask for your consideration.</p>

Since the September 18th Incident Two Years Ago, We, Both the Government and the People, Have Endured Insult and Borne Heavy Burdens, Dreaming of Peace, Hoping that the Japanese Imperialists Would Suddenly Repent, Pull Back on the Brink, and Pull Back from the Precipice. However, the Brutal Japanese Are Inherently Ambitious and Stubbornly Unruly. In Seventeen Months, Not Only Have They Not Repented, but Their Aggressive Acts Have Intensified, Seizing Our Yuguan, Attacking Our Luanhe, Threatening Our Beiping and Tianjin, and Trampling on Our Wenlu and Chaoyang. To All Places of Whale-Like Devouring and Silkworm-Like Encroachment, They Directly Want to Overthrow Our National Nation. In Today's Situation, There Is No Way to Seek Life Without Fighting, and There Is No Way to Save Death Without Sacrifice. It Is Indeed as Your Telegram Says, We Still Hope to Stir Up the Three Armies, Viciously Kill the Ugly Captives, Recover Lost Land, Complete Our Rivers and Mountains, Strive for Survival for the Country, and Avenge the Strange Shame for the Nation.

<p>The Comfort and Support Society for Anti-Japanese Soldiers, initiated by the City Chamber of Commerce and supported by various groups in the city, has resolved to dispatch representatives to Beiping on the 27th to comfort and support the army. All comfort and support supplies have been collected in order and are being packed and awaiting transport. There is still a lack of donated items. Therefore, we are hereby notifying all trade associations to do their best to donate and go to the national crisis together, and we are also requesting the Railway Department of Nanjing to order the Railway Bureau to transport them free of charge. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter Soliciting Military Supplies:</p>
<p>Respectfully, due to the needs of the front, we are in need of goggles, bicycles, telescopes, steel helmets, cargo trucks, gas masks, medicines, garden lead wire, military telephones, coal shovels, hoes, canned food, sacks, underwear, military blankets, etc. We plan to request that each industry do its best to donate and send them to our association. These items do not have to be limited to what your industry owns. Our merchants should know that this battle is far more important than the one in Songhu. The life of our nation is tied to this, and we must approach it with the spirit of national mobilization. The soldiers do not hesitate to die, and the people do not hesitate to spend money. Together, we will go to the national crisis, so as to avoid the final failure. Let us encourage each other. Requesting free transportation</p>
<p>Hon. Sirs of the Nanjing Railway Department, since the fall of Yuguan and the alarm in Jehol, all sectors of this city have organized the Comfort and Support Society for Frontline Anti-Japanese Soldiers. Now, 150 boxes of comfort and support items have been collected, and a separate list is attached. We ask that the Railway Department review and approve this and quickly send a telegram to the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureaus to transport them free of charge, so as to comfort the patriotism of the people and strengthen the enemy's anger on the front line. It is for the public good. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows in respect.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Silver and Money Industry Initiates Comfort and Support for Frontline Soldiers <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Hoping to Raise Millions of Gold in Money or Goods</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident last year, when the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, all sectors of Shanghai rushed to provide comfort and support to the frontline soldiers with goods and cash. On the 21st of this month, Japan, angered by the League of Nations advocating fairness and the world's public opinion not supporting its actions, illegally occupied the three northeastern provinces and then brazenly launched an attack on Jehol. A reporter from the Kwok Man News Agency, because the frontline soldiers were engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat, believed that all sectors of Shanghai would certainly offer comfort and support, so he visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, to inquire. According to Mr. Lin, since the Japanese army illegally occupied our three northeastern provinces on September 18th of the year before last, all the people of the country have been extremely indignant, simply because they love peace, maintain the world's economy and commerce, and avoid the suffering of the people, so our government, representing the will of the people, respected the covenants and appealed to the League of Nations, hoping to subdue power with the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Pact of Paris, and public reason. Recently, the Committee of Nineteen advocated fairness, directly condemning the wrongs of the Japanese and affirming our country's sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces and the boycott of Japanese goods as a retaliation against the Japanese army's illegal force. However, the Japanese soldiers, clinging to evil and unrepentant, still have no intention of repenting and are again plotting to invade our country's Jehol. Our country has truly been forced to this point and can no longer endure it. The frontline troops have long held the resolve to die to recover the territory, and President Song Dai, representing the central government, has traveled a long distance and already has a determination to actively resist Japan. The people are happy to enthusiastically provide support. The Bankers' Association has already had a conversation with the leaders of the money industry and decided to donate 100,000 to 150,000 yuan to comfort the frontline soldiers, following the example of the Bankers' Association in Beiping donating 10,000 sets of cotton clothing. However, the strength of the silver and money industry is limited. All sectors of Shanghai have patriotic enthusiasm and are expected to take action, and it should not be difficult to raise millions of comfort items or money. Liao, Ji, and Hei have successively fallen, and recently, the situation has intensified, with the occupation of Yuguan and the invasion of Jehol. Such nibbling and wanting more is not only an attempt to invade our territory but also to destroy our nation. The generals are upholding the great righteousness of defending the country and taking the deep warning of the overturning of the nest. They are fighting hard and resisting, repeatedly thwarting the fierce attack, and we express our heartfelt condolences. We still hope that you will maintain your unyielding spirit and continue to fight hard, so that the final victory will surely belong to us. Our association and all the citizens of the city are determined to fight with a common hatred and vow to be the backing. In addition to already leading all sectors of the city to prepare a large number of items and dispatching representatives to come to the front line to provide comfort, we are hereby sending a telegram to report this. We await the good news. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality bows down.]"</p>

<p>Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Tang Yulin of Rehe, stating: "Respectfully to Chairman Tang Yulin of Rehe. Since the brutal Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, our government has endured humiliation and made concessions, hoping for a just resolution. Now, the League of Nations has drafted a report and recommendations to uphold justice, and it was hoped that justice would be served and brutality would be restrained. However, recent telegrams report that the brutal Japanese are about to mobilize the entire nation's forces to invade Rehe Province, in order to implement their aggressive policy. This monstrous act arouses the indignation of the world. Previously, we read your telegram and respectfully learned of your loyalty and determination to defend the country, unwavering in your commitment. You will lead your troops to fight the enemy. Your unwavering loyalty is admired by all. Now, reading Mr. Ma's telegram, we further learn that the enemy forces have launched a general offensive, initiating a major battle. Looking north at the beacon fires, we are filled with sorrow and indignation. Since you have clearly upheld your duty to defend the territory and are prepared to die on the battlefield, the people of the country should support you without the need for any prompting. We hope that you will bravely advance, not only resisting at Yunshui but also blocking them at the Three Islands. Our association pledges to devote all our efforts to provide material and spiritual assistance. We respectfully reply by telegram, awaiting news of victory.

<p>Actively Proceeding with Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report stated: "Regarding the issuance of national salvation bonds and other matters, news from the banking sector in this city yesterday stated that 20 million yuan of national salvation bonds will be issued specifically for military expenses to resist the enemy. President Song Ziwen has repeatedly consulted with financial circles in Beiping and Tianjin on issuance methods, and it is reported that he has already advanced 10 million yuan from Tianjin banks. This amount is sufficient to cover military expenses in North China for three, four, or five months. Future military expenses will continue to be planned. After President Song returned to Shanghai a few days ago, he summoned leaders from the banking sector in this city on the 22nd to discuss financial matters. However, the matter of issuing national salvation bonds in Shanghai was not brought up for discussion, and it is likely that it will be postponed. The most important task for the Ministry of Finance at present is the implementation of abolishing taels and changing to yuan. Therefore, after Mr. Song returned to Shanghai, he discussed the implementation methods with the banking sector, so that the concurrent use of taels and yuan from March 1st will be smooth, and the abolition of taels and change to yuan can be realized on July 1st. Mr. Song also summoned former Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong yesterday to consult on financial matters."</p>

<p>Rumors Are Groundless</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report stated: "After the outbreak of the Rehe war, rumors have spread in this city. Some uninformed residents in northern Shanghai have been alarmed. The source of these rumors is a telegram from a certain Japanese news agency, claiming that the League of Nations is unfavorable to Japan, and Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations and act recklessly. It also stated that if the attack on Rehe fails, it will inevitably disrupt Beiping, Tianjin, and the coastal and river areas. In fact, the purpose of this news is solely to intimidate the League of Nations and is not worth taking seriously. According to observations from foreign military circles stationed in Shanghai, there will be no unexpected events. Mayor Wu Tiecheng also stated that public security in this city can be guaranteed."</p>

<h3 id="e92">Schools to be Established <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Wo Jiang, Executive Director of China Aviation Corporation, told a reporter from Xin Sheng She yesterday morning that the people of the whole country are extremely enthusiastic about the movement to save the country through aviation. However, enlightened people are quite worried that the domestic talent for piloting airplanes is insufficient. According to what I know, there are no less than six or seven hundred Chinese people who can learn aviation and serve the country. Apart from a part who were trained by the Central Aviation School, the rest are all studying abroad. Since September 18th, there have been quite a few overseas Chinese and students studying aviation in the United States and various parts of Southeast Asia. During January 28th, many also returned to the country to serve. Because our country does not have many airplanes, although a part has been recruited into the air force and aviation schools, there are still many who are idle and scattered. In addition, this association, considering that there is only one aviation school in the country, and that training talent is really too little, plans to establish a flying and navigation school, using the latest scientific training methods. In three months, people can be trained to become airplane pilots. The government is very supportive of this association, and borrowing airfields and other things can be done. Therefore, there are not many difficulties in the preparation of the flying school, and it can be gradually held in the short term.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association</p>
<p>In the face of the brutal Japanese invasion and plunder of our territory, which has not only ravaged Shanghai but also plotted against the Northeast, how can we, as fellow citizens, not feel chilled? We have specially initiated a donation to purchase the [Ningbo] airplane to resist Japan. This matter has been recorded in this newspaper. Since the initiation, we have received enthusiastic donations from fellow patriots in various ports, which is truly admirable. The Tongshun Transportation Company in Pukou and its colleagues have donated 50 yuan. Shen Xicai and others from the Hufeng Industrial Raw Material Company in Hankou have donated 5 yuan. Mr. Dong Huitang and Hui Tang from the Nanjing China Cement Company have donated 2 yuan. The most noteworthy is a letter from Mr. Xin Buleng, which is attached below. To the Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association: Since January 28th, the Japanese have realized the effectiveness of airplanes and have actively raised funds to purchase them. In just a few months, they have raised funds for more than 100 airplanes. Looking back at our country, three provinces have been invaded by the brutal Japanese, and tens of thousands of our compatriots have been shot and killed. Recently, they have become even more aggressive, eyeing our entire country like tigers and whales. At this critical moment, how should our compatriots contribute their wealth to alleviate the crisis? Yet, our countrymen still adhere to the principle of cherishing money as life, unaware that the enemy is at the door. Soon, they will enter our homes. Even if we possess gold and silver, can we still own them? We must know that if the country exists, the people exist; if the country perishes, the people perish. We hope that those who are willing to contribute to saving the country will help, so that there may be a glimmer of hope. Xin Buleng, a descendant of a patriotic man, feels deeply ashamed. I have specially raised 40 yuan to send to you. I hope you will check and receive it. I believe that our Shanghai residents will understand the greater righteousness. In the future, if we gather all our strength, we will see our [Ningbo] airplane flying over the world, and the destruction of the Eastern dwarfs can be expected soon. [Omitted below]</p>
<h3 id="e94">Mobil Oil Chinese Employees <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Mobil Oil Chinese Employees Aviation Salvation</p>
<p>The National Mobil Oil Chinese Employees Aviation Salvation Corps declared: Alas, the enemy is deeply entrenched, and the country is on the verge of ruin. Are we willing to live drunken and dreamy lives, emulating the swallows under the eaves and the fish in the cauldron, eking out a miserable existence? Are we willing to sit idly by and watch the four-thousand-year-old land of culture and the four hundred million descendants of China become the successors of Korea, Taiwan, and Ryukyu? As the saying goes, "While there is still breath, this ambition will not cease." Another saying goes, "A centipede, even in death, does not fall down." Seeing the people of the Northeast bravely advancing, one falling after another, sacrificing their lives for righteousness, and the people in the rear enthusiastically donating and continuously supplying, it is truly because the spirit of the entire nation is inspired, their spirit sweeping across mountains and rivers, their passion overflowing, their righteousness reaching the heavens. Heads can be cut off, bodies can be torn apart, but we will not allow others to snore beside our bed. However, based on past facts and the reasons for failure in the two battles of Shanghai, it is not due to a lack of morale or the imprecision of tactics. The only regret is the oppression of the air force. The retreat from Shanghai was caused by bombing, and the defense of Linyu was also supported by bombing. Recently, they have further attacked Rehe, eyeing Beiping and Tianjin, inching forward, devouring like silkworms and whales. Where will their fierce flames lead? If we do not seek thorough salvation and achieve the final effect, will this great land of China not become the enemy's possession and the meat on the chopping board? How can we talk about recovering the white mountains and black waters? It is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep. Although the east corner is lost, the sunset can be reaped. This is why we rise up with righteousness and call out from a high place with the slogan of saving the country through aviation. Since Mayor Wu advocated it in Shanghai, it has been actively carried out and has already become quite popular. The so-called children are calling, the youth are calling, and the merchants are calling, and they have been seen many times in the newspapers. Only our Mobil Oil Chinese employees have not been heard of. Our patriotic enthusiasm dares not lag behind others. Therefore, we intend to awaken the Chinese employees of Mobil Oil across the country to generously donate once a month (the location and account name for remittance will be announced in the newspaper later). The Chinese employees of Mobil Oil, even in Shanghai alone, are already quite considerable. If we can combine the efforts of comrades across the country to assist, the amount will be astonishing. We will see the Mobil Oil Chinese Employees brand, from number one, number two, number three, up to number ten and number one hundred, exerting our financial strength to the fullest, the more the better. We will save the country's pulse in a critical situation and win glory for the nation. In the future, we will directly attack Tokyo, drink our fill in Japan, annihilate the Japanese bandits, and our martial prowess will be displayed. It may not be the help of other mountains, and our comrades will also share the honor. However, we have more heart than strength. We use special painstaking efforts to make the call of Jiang Bo, hoping that all comrades will rise up together, organize branch groups and remit donations continuously, saving the money spent on cigarettes and alcohol to establish the foundation of the country forever, fulfilling the duty of every citizen to contribute, and leaving achievements for the future generations. The country will be strong, and the people will be prosperous, which depends on this. This is announced in advance for your public information.</p>

<p>Since all sectors initiated saving the country through aviation,</p>
<p>all the stallholders in the Hongkou Triangle Market, about 2,000 households, immediately gathered to discuss donating money to purchase airplanes for national defense. However, due to the lack of a perfect organization, nothing has been accomplished. Yesterday, there was a news report about the Aviation Association starting its solicitation work. On the spot, 21 stallholders signed up voluntarily to join the Aviation Association as special members, including Zhang Zongbao, Xue Yongxiang, Qian Wenqing, Xu Genquan, Pan Amao, Qian Xianglang, Ji Weixin, Tang Heshen, and Li Guoqing. Nine people volunteered to be ordinary members, including Qian Jinqing, Zhang Zhiliang, Gu Ayou, Gong Tinghua, Shen Shijie, Wang Ruiqi, Zhou Xianglang, Ji Sanlang, Zhu Jinbiao, Bao Hanshan, and Zou Qisheng. In addition to twelve people like Mrs. Zhang, it was also proposed that each stallholder contribute one cent of silver (equivalent to three copper coins) per day, and that one person be elected every Saturday to settle the accounts and remit them to the Aviation Association or the collection agency. On the same day, more than 200 households voluntarily pledged to donate. If all households can pledge to donate in the future, about 500 yuan can be obtained in donations every month.</p>

<p>Seeking Speed and Efficiency in Transmitting Smuggling Information</p>
<p>In order to strictly prevent tax evasion, the National Government has approved the Customs to add a dedicated wireless radio station to seek speed and efficiency in transmitting smuggling information and dispatching coastal patrol boats. It is reported that the Customs authorities now plan to set up general stations in Yantai, Shanghai, Xiamen, and the Chinese boundary of Kowloon, and branch stations in Shantou, Haikou, and Qiongzhou. In the future, if there is a need to add more stations, it will be extended to other ports. The radio waves of each station have a limited range, as they are only used by the Customs to transmit messages between the various stations and patrol boats, which can be relayed to each other.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Li Ting'an Discusses the Importance of Factory Hygiene <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>In response to the Zhengtai Factory Incident</p>
<p>Following the fire at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Tangshan Road, which resulted in the deaths of over one hundred workers and the loss of more than two hundred thousand yuan in capital, Director of the Bureau of Health, Mr. Li Ting'an, issued the following statement: "While the modern era is one of machine production, the application of machines still relies on workers. Therefore, workers are of utmost importance in production, and promoting industry must prioritize labor hygiene. Our country's factory laws already contain provisions regarding worker safety, hygiene, and limitations on the work hours of child and female laborers. However, it is regrettable that very few factories in our country currently comply with these regulations. The recent tragedy at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory has prompted the following reflections: (1) If the factory had implemented labor hygiene measures, this tragedy would not have occurred. The meaning of labor hygiene extends far beyond merely treating workers' illnesses. All factors that could harm workers' health and lives should be prevented, and specialized personnel should be employed to conduct regular inspections to reduce the risk of fire, floods, injuries, infectious diseases, and other hazards. (2) Our country's industry is in urgent need of promotion. Therefore, effective measures should be taken to ensure factory hygiene, so that factories can profit and workers' lives can be secured. The Zhengtai Rubber Factory tragedy, in which both the factory and the workers suffered enormous losses, should serve as a profound lesson for all those in our country who aspire to contribute to industry. However, the Zhengtai Factory is merely unfortunate to be the first to suffer such a disaster. In all fairness, the number of factories with similar latent dangers is far too numerous to mention. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to single out the Zhengtai Factory for criticism." Director Li also stated that labor hygiene should be jointly administered and implemented by factories and workers under the guidance of administrative agencies such as the Bureaus of Health and Social Affairs. This would likely be effective. He plans to exchange views with the Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs and convene a meeting of the city's industrial sector at an opportune time to find ways to establish such a system. The benefits of labor hygiene can be divided into three aspects: For the factory, it eliminates unexpected losses of assets (such as the reported financial loss of over two hundred thousand yuan at the Zhengtai Factory) and reduces losses in work efficiency (as the replacement of injured or sick workers by others can result in a decrease in proficiency and efficiency). For society, it reduces the losses from disability and death and preserves some of the productive capacity of society. For workers, it prevents unexpected disasters and illnesses, preserving their ability to save money. Therefore, labor hygiene is a crucial task that our country must address immediately. It is hoped that this message will be conveyed to the industrial and labor sectors, who will work together to this end. This Bureau is deeply committed to providing sincere guidance.</p>

<p>Donate to National Aviation Salvation</p>
<p>Totaling Five Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Already Delivered to the Zhongnan Bank Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Gan Dounan, General Manager of the Li Xing Thermos Factory in this city, has long held the ambition of saving the country through industry. Since the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931], he has been promoting the manufacture of various "Great Wall" brand thermos bottles, featuring novel designs and ample heat retention, to symbolize the defense of the Great Wall against enemies. Since their launch, he has strived to compete with foreign goods, successfully reclaiming profits. Now, due to the relentless advance of the invading enemy and the critical situation in Rehe, Mr. Gan believes that without advanced aviation weapons, it will be impossible to avert the crisis. He has donated two hundred yuan in the name of Li Xing Factory No. 1 and one hundred yuan in the name of Li Xing Factory No. 2 to the China Aviation Construction Association. Mr. Gan himself donated one hundred yuan, and his sister, Ms. Jin Ganbaoren, donated one hundred yuan. These donations were delivered to the Zhongnan Bank yesterday for verification. This demonstrates their patriotic zeal. It is hoped that the people of the country will rise up and contribute as much as they can.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods and the China National Goods Maintenance Association issued a notice to their members and factories yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, according to a letter from the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from our member Tong Taichang Chen Heqing, the sales of Japanese goods in the Siamese market have recently surged, especially cotton yarn, while national goods are practically ignored. The reason is that the prices of national goods are too high. In order to reclaim profits and promote the sales of national goods, we should relay to Shanghai merchants to lower their prices to allow for competitive sales, etc. We request that your association convey to the merchants to reduce prices, which would be deeply appreciated, etc." This is also according to a letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce with the same request. Accordingly, a corresponding notice is specially sent to you, hoping that your establishment will, within possible limits, reduce the prices of your products as much as possible, so that overseas Chinese will eagerly purchase them, which is the only way to promote the sales of national goods and resist enemy goods. Gentlemen of understanding, we believe you will agree. This is specially dispatched for the attention of all national goods companies, industrial and commercial factories."</p>

<h3 id="e106">Rice Merchants in Northern Shanghai Aid the Petition for Level Measures and Funnels <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Document Presented to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northern Rice Transporters United Association submitted a document to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating: "Submitting this document to request a swift resolution to the issue of rice measures, to end the disputes and avoid affecting the people's food supply. Since the fifteenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1926], disputes over rice measures have occurred continuously. This is a phenomenon unique to this area. The root cause lies not in the system of measuring instruments, but in whether the measurers are using 'tricks.' In the past, there were occasional unscrupulous market elements who used 'heavy in, light out' tricks to deceive customers, but once their schemes were exposed, their reputation would be ruined. Therefore, honest merchants were ashamed to engage in such practices. However, since the poor harvest and high rice prices in the fifteenth year of the Republic, this kind of fraudulent practice has emerged, and disputes have suddenly arisen, forming a widespread and shameful custom. They are shamelessly abandoning commercial ethics and sinking into depravity. The association has repeatedly protested in the past and has always been treated fairly by your bureau. However, although there has been temporary peace, the old problems soon reappear, leading to resistance from southern Shanghai, and the disturbances have spread and have not been resolved. If fundamental treatment is not applied, the people's livelihood will suffer greatly. The association has previously submitted suggestions to strictly prohibit measurers from using 'tricks' and to support the independent profession of measurers. Now, just as the new system of measures is beginning to be implemented, the disturbances over rice measures have also arisen. This proves that it is not a matter of the measuring instrument system, but whether the measurers are using 'tricks.' The rice merchants in southern Shanghai advocate the use of level measures and funnels, which is the fairest way to eliminate the malpractice of 'heavy' and 'light' measures. The association deeply sympathizes with this proposal. As for rice firms and dealers, they are intermediaries between rice transporters and rice shops. The most appropriate method is to have all parties present at the time of measurement to supervise each other. As for the rice shops, it is insufficient for them to measure the rice on their own when the rice carts arrive. This responsibility is inefficiently handled by both the measurers and the transporters. Originally, this was only to prevent malpractices from occurring en route by the delivery person. Therefore, the action of rice shops measuring rice is absolutely unrelated to the transporters and measurers. Recently, rice merchants in southern Shanghai have been forced to stop loading rice, and rice merchants in northern Shanghai also share their concerns. However, to protect the food supply of the city's residents, the association is actively encouraging rice merchants to wait patiently for a resolution. If the situation is prolonged, the disturbances will inevitably spread, and the resolution will become more difficult. Therefore, we specially request your bureau to provide a fundamental resolution as soon as possible, so as to achieve permanent peace and benefit the future of the rice industry and the food supply of the people. We eagerly await your response. Sincerely, the Shanghai Northern Rice Transporters United Association to Director Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs."</p>

<p>Branch offices can join trade associations.</p>
<p>If there is no association, they can become merchant members of the chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs received Order No. 4459 from the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Approved the Ministry of Industry's Commercial Document No. 16088, regarding the reply to the matter of inquiry from the National United Association of Match Manufacturers regarding whether branch offices or agencies can join industrial and commercial trade associations. Requested investigation and reply, etc. Approved. Upon investigation, if the branch offices or agencies mentioned in the original document are branch offices of companies or firms, they can be regarded as companies or firms and join trade associations. However, if there are fewer than seven businesses in the same industry within a region, an association cannot be legally formed, so participation is out of the question. For the local chamber of commerce, they can still join as merchant members. Approved the above. Correspondingly reply, requesting investigation and instructions for compliance, etc. Approved. Upon investigation, this case was previously forwarded to the government by your bureau and was duly consulted and instructed. Now, the above is approved. Correspondingly order your bureau to comply immediately and instruct for notification. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Committee Refusing Water Cutoffs Held Its First Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Petitioning the Municipal Government and Other Places Today</p>
<p>Informing Tenants to Vow to Fight to the End</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association Asks Feng Bingnan to Mediate</p>
<p>Ever since the British Shanghai Waterworks Company, accompanied by armed Chinese and Western detectives, cut off the main water pipes in Shuncheng Lane and other places on Yangshupu Road in the Eastern District and filled them with asphalt and gravel, it has aroused the resentment of the residents. Representatives were dispatched to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the water company to petition, but the Shanghai Municipal Council made no concrete response. According to the water company, the installation of water meters was in accordance with the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the company's finances are quite strained due to the cost of installing water meters, which is over one hundred thousand taels of silver. Therefore, it is difficult to reduce water rates, and no result was achieved. At 8:45 p.m. the day before yesterday, two detectives even stopped people from drawing water by the Taiping tap and locked the tap. The water users were detained in the police station and were only released on bail after a large number of tenants demanded their release. The tenants of the lane, fearing that they would not be able to cook their meals if this continued, convened an autonomous tenant meeting yesterday and decided to contact the twenty-nine water cutoff lanes in the eastern district of Shanghai to carry out large-scale and active actions. They also decided to form the Shanghai Eastern Shuncheng Lane Committee Refusing Water Cutoffs and will submit documents to the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Council of Councilors, the Taxpayers Association, the Tenant Union, and the Citizens Union today to request intervention and assistance. Notices will also be posted in the lane. The details of each item are recorded below.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Eastern Shuncheng Lane Committee Refusing Water Cutoffs hereby notifies: Esteemed elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow citizens, I respectfully inform you that since the Shanghai January 28th Incident, all industries have declined, workers have lost their jobs, wages have decreased, and the people have suffered greatly. The British Shanghai Waterworks Company, however, at this time, followed the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Council to install water meters and greatly increase water prices, increasing the amount previously paid by tenfold. The people are suffering and cannot afford this. In the midst of ongoing negotiations, the Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly sent armed detectives to accompany the Shanghai Waterworks Company to cut off the water. Water and fire are essential for the people's daily life, and cutting off the water with force is tantamount to killing the people. Therefore, the people of our lane are united and have formed the Committee Refusing Water Cutoffs. In addition to requesting assistance from various agencies, we are also uniting with the people of Shanghai to jointly resist the Shanghai Waterworks Company's price increase and oppose the Shanghai Municipal Council's armed water cutoffs. We also hope that our elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow citizens will not cause disputes due to competing for water, but will remain calm and wait for a resolution. This committee vows to fight to the end. This is specially notified.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Some Slogans <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The committee decided on the following slogans:</p>
<p>(1) Residents of eastern Shanghai, unite and organize a Committee Refusing Water Cutoffs! (2) Oppose water cutoffs, demand immediate water supply! (3) Oppose increasing water prices! (4) Oppose the waterworks company that disregards the lives of the people! (5) Oppose the Shanghai Municipal Council's armed water cutoffs! (6) The people spontaneously organize water protection teams! (7) Citizens of Shanghai, unite and organize a Committee Refusing Water Cutoffs! etc. Starting today, these will be posted in various lanes to urge residents to unite and fight to achieve the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>The Sixth District Branch of the Citizens' Association received a letter yesterday from tenants' representatives Sheng Xinru, Qiu Jialiang, Chen Baoxing, Zhang Hechun, Chen Xintian, etc. of Jingqing Lane, stating that their lane was forcibly cut off by the waterworks company on the morning of the 20th, causing panic among the residents and creating dangerous situations. Therefore, the representatives, Qiu Jialiang, etc., were elected, and although they negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council to temporarily open the Taiping tap along the main road at the entrance of the lane, it was insufficient for the large number of residents, leading to disputes and injuries. If the original situation is not restored as soon as possible, there will be no water to drink, which is a matter of life. The association will send the above information to the Chinese Taxpayers Association and the Citizens' General Union to request serious negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council to protect the lives of the people and ensure social stability.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, a Cantonese woman in Jingqing Lane on East Seward Road was blocked by a Shanghai Municipal Council worker yesterday while using the Taiping tap on the street as usual due to the water cutoff by the waterworks company. Due to the language barrier, a conflict ensued. The owner of the Yuanchang Porcelain Shop came out to mediate, but the worker turned his anger on the owner of the Yuanchang Shop. A patrolman arrived and wanted to take the owner of the Yuanchang Shop to the police station, but the owner refused, and his clothes were torn in the dispute. They eventually went to the police station but were soon released. The worker also bled from his teeth due to the conflict.</p>

<p>Xia Aqing Denies Previous Confession</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The case of Wang Diqing from Gold Mountain being killed by Wang Tao, Xia Aqing, Zhang, and others has already been judged. Wang Yutian, the accountant, was arrested and sentenced to death by the Gold Mountain County for suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Wang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. Two hearings were held in February and March of last year. However, due to the files of Wang Tao and others being at the Supreme Court and not yet transferred, the hearings were postponed. The Jiangsu High Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Song Yuan and others. The defendant, Wang Yutian, appointed Gao Ruoxiang and Wang Zengxian (represented by Qu Yue, entrusted by lawyers) as lawyers to defend him in court. During the interrogation, Wang denied conspiring to kill Wang Diqing and detailed his return to Song, his travels to collect debts, and his recuperation from illness. Wang Tao denied having an affair with Wang Yutian. Xia Aqing also denied stating in the first trial that Wang Tao relayed Wang Yutian's urging to kill Wang Youqing. After thorough arguments by Wang and Gao, Judge Song announced the end of the debate and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Labor Dispute at the Great China Overshoe Factory over Union Organization <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>| Conflict Between Workers and Manager |</p>
<p>The Great China Overshoe Factory, located on Xingjiazhai Road in Zhabei, employs approximately two hundred male and female workers. Recently, the factory was ordered by the city's Party Headquarters to reorganize the workers' union and place it under the jurisdiction of the Fourth District Rubber Workers' Union by the 26th of this month. Workers Zhang Linbing, Wu Fushou, and others were appointed as organizers to handle the re-registration and other matters. Yesterday afternoon, around 3 PM, Zhang and others went to each male and female worker to record their names and numbers for registration. However, one female foreman suspected that Zhang and others had ulterior motives and immediately reported to the factory manager, Yang Yongyi. Yang immediately summoned Zhang and others for a discussion, asking if they intended to incite a labor strike. Zhang and others immediately denied this, but Yang remained unconvinced, leading to a verbal conflict. Yang grabbed Wu Fushou and slapped him twice, tearing his clothes in the process of the dispute. Zhang and others argued that the union organization was ordered by the authorities and not a private undertaking, and that physical assault was unjustified. They then took Yang to the First Branch of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for investigation. After questioning by Chief Liang, the bureau attempted mediation but failed, and the group of people was transferred to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Homecoming of War Orphan Lu Junwu, Son of Battalion Commander Lu Bin Who Died in the Shanghai Battle <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Returned to the Clan After Verification by Jiang, Cai, and Others</p>
<p>Lu Bin was from Yixing, Suzhou. During the Shanghai Battle, he served as the deputy battalion commander in the Sixth Regiment of the Seventy-eighth Division of the Nineteenth Route Army. On the night of January 28th, his battalion was stationed in the area of Tiantong'an Road and Baoxing Road when the battle broke out. Their defense line was the first to be attacked. The battalion commander bravely moved back and forth on the front lines, diligently directing the troops. Unfortunately, he was fatally struck by a stray bullet and died. His remains were transported back to his hometown for burial by his brother, Lu Jie. Later, upon his mother's orders, Lu Jie went to Guangdong to retrieve the widow, Shi Yuehao, and the orphaned son, Lu Junwu. However, upon arriving in Guangdong, Shi had already become involved with Yu Keming, an employee of a bureau in Guangzhou. Upon hearing of Lu Jie's arrival, she avoided meeting him. After much effort, Lu Jie finally found her, but Shi not only refused to return to Suzhou but also denied that Junwu was Lu Bin's orphaned son. Left with no choice, Lu Jie filed a lawsuit in the Guangzhou District Court and the High Court. Former Nineteenth Route Army Commander Jiang, Commander Cai, Division Commander Qu, Brigade Commander Zhang, and Chief Secretary of the Headquarters Zhu Jiasheng all sent letters to the court, proving that Junwu was indeed Lu Bin's orphaned son. After half a year of litigation, the case was finally closed. Lu Jie has now returned to Suzhou with the orphaned son, Junwu, and will soon return to his hometown to rejoin the clan.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Congestion of Wheat Ships on the Huangpu River <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Slow Unloading Leads to Increased Accumulation</p>
<p>Insufficient Floating Docks on the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that there is a recent surge in the number of wheat ships on the Huangpu River, causing considerable congestion. There is a shortage of suitable floating docks for the wheat ships to berth. With more ships expected to arrive, the Huangpu River will soon be full. Currently, there are five wheat ships docked in Shanghai. Since the beginning of the year, thirty-seven ships have arrived, and six more are expected by the end of the month. Each ship can carry approximately seven thousand tons of wheat, mostly from Australia, with some from Canada and Argentina. The congestion of wheat imports is reportedly due to a domestic wheat harvest that is only one-third of the usual yield. However, some of the wheat is believed to be destined for the north to supply food to the Chinese troops in Rehe. The congestion of wheat ships on the Huangpu River is not only due to the large number of arrivals but also to the slow unloading process and the lack of storage space at flour mills. In Western countries, wheat is unloaded using machinery that sucks it into elevators and transports it to storage silos, relying entirely on mechanical power and completing the unloading in one or two days. In Shanghai, however, the wheat needs to be bagged, transported onto barges, and then transferred to the mills, which typically takes ten to eleven days to unload each ship, rarely completing the process in less than a week. Combined with the recent surge in wheat ship arrivals, this has further exacerbated the congestion on the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3 id="e128">University Student Dies by Poisoning <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Luo Qiheng from Gaoxian, Sichuan</p>
<p>Suspected Suicide Due to Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Luo Qiheng, a university student from Gaoxian, Sichuan, aged twenty-eight, lived alone in a small room in the Jinderi building, No. 7 Jinshenfu Road, French Concession, renting from Gu Kaiyuan from Nanjing for five yuan per month. He moved in last September and left the house every morning at 11 AM, returning between 11 PM and 12 AM. He ate at the Qiangpu Sichuan Restaurant at No. 16 Dapufang, Dapu Bridge, and was from the same hometown as the restaurant owner, Xiong Shengtin. For the past three days, the sub-landlord noticed that Luo had not been going out and that there was no movement or sound from his room, suspecting he was ill. On the morning of the 22nd, at 12 PM, he knocked on the door, but there was no response. He pried open the door and found Luo had died from poisoning, with blood foam coming from his mouth. It was unknown when he had died. The sub-landlord reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. Several letters were found in the room, including one from his brother criticizing his extravagance, his multiple marriages and divorces with women in Shanghai, and urging him to return home as soon as the remittance arrived. Besides the bed, bedding, and mosquito net, there were no other belongings. It was inferred that Luo committed suicide due to financial difficulties. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for an autopsy. Since there were no relatives of the deceased in Shanghai, a report was filed with the Second Special District Court yesterday morning. Prosecutor Deng Baosun arrived at the mortuary to confirm that the death was indeed due to poisoning. According to the sub-landlord Gu Kaiyuan's account of the discovery, it was decided that the body would be photographed and then collected and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Bidding for Yuehan Railway Project in Shanghai <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Yuehan Railway has been under construction since the late Qing Dynasty, lasting more than thirty years with repeated setbacks, never completed. By 1930, the sections completed include the northern section from Hankou to Changsha, totaling 385 kilometers, called the Xiang'e section; and the southern section, initially built by Guangdong Province from Guangzhou to Shaoguan for 350 kilometers, later redeemed by the Ministry of Railways, called the Guangshao section. During the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity diplomatic agreement in 1930, the National Government, recognizing the importance of completing the railway, decided to allocate all the indemnity funds to complete the project. The Ministry of Railways appointed Ling Zhuming, the former director of the Longhai Railway Engineering Bureau, to oversee the railway's construction. In the past three years, the 50-kilometer section from Shaozhou to Lechang will be completed in April of this year. As for the entire railway project, the most difficult section from Lechang to Dashimen has all the plans and designs ready and is scheduled to be put out for bid in March or April this year, with construction to begin soon. However, this section is very large, with seven tunnels within 45 kilometers, the longest reaching 230 meters, 250 bridges and culverts, the longest reaching 270 meters, over three million cubic meters of earthwork, and five to six hundred thousand cubic meters of concrete work. It is feared that only contractors with rich experience and strong capital can handle it. Knowing that there are many contractors in Shanghai with the above qualifications, it is planned to simultaneously solicit bids in Shanghai. The bidding advertisement has been entrusted to Shanghai architect Yang Ximiao by the bureau to distribute in Shanghai. It is heard that Chinese and foreign construction experts in Shanghai are paying close attention to the project due to the Boxer Indemnity guarantee and are actively preparing to participate in the bidding. Some have even personally visited the railway to inspect everything in order to accurately estimate the bid price, showing the importance construction professionals place on the railway project.</p>

<p>Liu Qingquan Seeks Employment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau recently received a letter from the Municipal Government Secretariat forwarding the case of Liu Qingquan, instructing the bureau to properly arrange for his resettlement. Upon inquiry, it was learned that Liu Qingquan is 47 years old, from Jinan, Shandong. He was a craftsman who went to France in 1916 under an agreement to work in the rear areas of the Allied forces. After the end of the European war, he continued to work in France to make a living. In recent years, he became unemployed and was repatriated by the Chinese Consulate in France. He presented various supporting documents, which were verified to be authentic. It was found that Liu Qingquan has considerable experience in machinery, ironwork, carpentry, and other labor-intensive jobs. He is also honest and diligent and has no bad habits. He is currently willing to seek employment in Shanghai to find a place to live and does not care about the wage. The Social Affairs Bureau, feeling pity for his plight, immediately sent him to the New Public Nursery for temporary shelter. Organizations or individuals in need of such a worker can contact the Fourth Section of the bureau at any time.</p>

<p>Defendants Suddenly Retract Previous Confessions in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Judge to Issue Verdict Based on Previous Confessions</p>
<p>Wu Guangzong, the director of the Naval Survey Office, resided in the Ningkangli neighborhood of Ximen, Shanghai. Several thugs went to Wu's home last year. Wu was in the toilet at the time and was shot and killed. The concession police arrested five suspects, including Wu Jigui, Yang Sanmao, Zhang Shaoliang, Song Jiande, and Zhang Changlin, and transferred them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. After clarifying the situation, they were sent to the local court. The prosecutor investigated, and the defendants confessed to the shooting, citing Wu's harsh treatment of subordinates as the reason. The prosecutor then filed charges according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen held a court session. Unexpectedly, the defendants retracted their previous confessions, denying the act and refusing to explain the reason. The relatives of the deceased and witnesses identified Wu Jigui and Yang Sanmao as the ones who held and fired the guns. The judge, referring to the previous confessions and the witnesses' testimony, found the case clear and began the closing arguments, setting a date for the verdict. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that before the departure of the Rutchputana on Tuesday, customs officers found five Chinese passengers in second class acting suspiciously, appearing to be carrying heavy objects. They were searched, and 161 gold bars were found, all stamped with Shanghai marks, with a total value of two hundred thousand taels of silver. They were evidently trying to smuggle them to Hong Kong. For violating the gold export ban, all the gold was confiscated. The five passengers were allowed to board the ship.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Request for Tax Exemption After New Oil Tax Increase <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs implemented the increase in the import tax on petroleum on the 5th of last month, only the products of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Standard Oil, and Texaco are exempt from the new tax. All other oil companies are required to pay the new tax on crude oil purchased from foreign countries. However, since the promulgation of the tax law, Jianghai Customs has not collected any of this new tax, but the refining industry has greatly declined as a result. The three major companies sell diesel to small refineries, raising prices by as much as 40 to 50 yuan above the market price. Refineries are severely affected by the high raw material prices and poor sales. Petroleum has a wide range of uses and is a necessary item for modern military equipment (as evidenced by the Russo-Japanese oil agreement to transport Russian oil to Japan for refining). The kerosene needed for today's machinery is very expensive, costing a huge amount of money each year. Now that China's industry is depressed, the authorities are not trying to save it, which concerns the people's livelihood and is no small matter. The US government exempts all raw materials that its country lacks from import duties. For example, tung oil is not produced in the US. Although the US government encourages planting, the output is still small, so it is exempt from tax when transported from China for sale. This is an example. It is heard that the Jiuji Oil Refinery and others in Shanghai have submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for a tax exemption, which is expected to be approved.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Lai Yi Ferry Crossing Blocked <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Merchants Petition for Retention and Opening</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's Eastern Route ferry has moved its dock from Lujia Ferry in Pudong to the Lan Ni Ferry Dongchang Road pier, starting yesterday. However, the Hongsheng Warehouse in the north blocked the privately-run Lai Yi Ferry crossing yesterday morning, and it was temporarily demolished after negotiations. However, the Pudong office of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the ferry crossing is an important passage for loading and unloading goods, so it has prepared a petition to the General Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Municipal Government to retain and open the ferry crossing to facilitate commerce. The original petition states: "The Lai Yi Ferry public ferry crossing has been suddenly blocked, causing public anger and a potential riot. We again request a speedy submission to the Municipal Government for an order to open the crossing. The Pudong Lan Ni Ferry crossing is the main route for the entry and exit of goods in the entire town. There is no other way. We previously heard that it would be blocked, and more than forty businesses, including the Rentai Rice Store, jointly requested assistance, and on the 4th of this month, we submitted a petition to your association requesting a speedy submission to the Municipal Government for relief. It has been half a month since then, and we have not received any instructions. This morning, the Hongsheng Warehouse suddenly blocked the ferry crossing by planting piles, causing the flow of goods between Pudong and the west to be cut off. The public is extremely angry and plans to organize a passive boycott to resist. We immediately went to various locations to persuade them to stop and wait for a solution and went to the Third District Bureau of the Public Security Bureau to meet with Director Zhang. Director Zhang agreed to persuade the compradore of the warehouse to temporarily remove the piles, and the manager was informed. The prosperity of commerce depends entirely on smooth flow and convenient transportation. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, all businesses have been depressed and operating in difficult circumstances, hoping for recovery. The ferry crossing is blocked, the source of goods is cut off, and the municipal ferry pier is only for pedestrians and does not allow the loading and unloading of goods. There is no other way out, and the stores will inevitably close their doors, turning the lively streets into dead alleys. Our Municipal Government is working hard to build and seek the revitalization of the entire city, and we believe that it will not regard Lai Yi Ferry as a lawless area. The situation is critical, and we are compelled to submit this petition to your association again, requesting a speedy submission to the Municipal Government to take into account the public interest and issue a clear order that the ferry crossing be open forever. Our 100,000 residents of the entire town pledge to be the government's backup and to deal with those who only care about their own interests. Respectfully submitted, awaiting orders with utmost urgency."</p>

<p>| Departure from Wusong Yesterday |</p>
<p>Five Americans, including Bo Xuelou, purchased a three-masted junk (i.e., Ningbo fishing boat), named it "New Horizon", and embarked on the grand undertaking of crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The ship, originally named Jinbaoyuan, has a capacity of approximately 25 tons. It was initially docked at the Yunzaobang Estuary in Wusong for internal repairs. It is said that all the navigational equipment is complete, and there is an office and a wireless telephone installed. Two Chinese men, Li Yinhe and Wang Guiquan (both from Ningbo), were hired to handle the sails and steer the ship. Bo Xuelou gave each of them a settlement fee of 400 yuan. Yesterday morning at 12:00, the ship set sail from the Yunzaobang Estuary, embarking on a journey without a set timetable. Li Yinhe told reporters that the plan is to first go to Hong Kong and then cross the ocean. He said that the ship has been repaired and is sturdy, and there is enough food to supply seven people for more than a year. He only hopes that there will be no storms on the ocean surface so that they can reach their destination sooner, which would be very fortunate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai China Jishang Society recently received a letter from Mr. Pan Zheren, raising 500 yuan from Mr. Jiang Xinghui, who saved money from the celebration of his father, Mr. Jiang Zhuocheng's 50th birthday and his late mother, Madam Cheng's 50th death anniversary, and donated it to the society for emergency disaster relief. The society, seeing the severe and worsening disaster situation in Shaanxi, which has become uncontrollable, immediately allocated the funds to Shaanxi to supplement the porridge kitchen and Wugong shelter expenses of the Xi'an branch and sent a special letter of thanks. Mr. Jiang's senior saving money from the banquet for disaster relief, his son Mr. Jiang Xinghui's magnanimous good intentions, and Mr. Pan Zheren's earnest appeal on behalf of the disaster victims are all good deeds. Their virtue can be an example. It is believed that there is no shortage of birthday banquets funds at home and abroad, which can be transferred to disaster relief, adding to life and obtaining blessings, so they can prosper for generations. This is better than building seven-story pagodas.</p>

<p>The D-type locomotives of the Jinghu Railway Machinery Depot have a total of four engines, and the drivers and firemen are divided into eight shifts. When the locomotives are running, one shift is on the train, and the other shift is working in the engine room, taking turns. Recently, Deputy Engineer Zhong Yangqi proposed to reduce the number of D-type locomotive workers to six shifts to save money, but the workers demanded to maintain the status quo. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, a major conflict erupted in the office due to disagreement. During the conflict, someone in the crowd threw a bag of manure at Zhong, covering his body and the office with a foul smell. After the incident, Engine Room Director Li Xizhi arrived upon hearing the news, but the workers had dispersed. Realizing the seriousness of the matter and the difficulty of handling it, he immediately reported the matter to his superiors for review. The workers, on the other hand, felt that Zhong, as an engineer, should not have sworn at them. Last night, they gathered all the workers in the Longtou Room to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>| Hearing Postponed to Today |</p>
<p>Guo Weiyi, the owner of the Watson's Soda Factory at No. 327 Jiangxi Road, a Teochew native, 45 years old, residing at No. 23 Demingli, Pushi Road, French Concession, was recently sued in the Second Special District Court by a fellow Teochew woman, Lin Yayue (25 years old), represented by lawyers Wu Kai, Qu Xiaobai, and Ni Gangyi, in a criminal self-accusation of rape and abandonment, requesting an investigation and, in addition, a civil lawsuit seeking compensation of 61,568 yuan for living expenses, clothing, food, pocket money, labor costs, medical expenses, and interest on debts until the age of 60 for a total of 36 years. The gist of the lawsuit states that when the plaintiff was 15 years old in 1923, her mother arranged for her to be fostered at the defendant's home (then residing in Renheli, Songshan Road) and to sleep with his fourth son, A Qing. On June 17 of that year, at 2 or 3 PM, the defendant brought bathwater to the bathing room, offering to let the plaintiff bathe, and then closed the door, giving her a ring and coaxing her with sweet words. He then raped her. They cohabited for six years. Because the defendant feared his family's authority, he sent the plaintiff back to her mother's home in her hometown to protect his family harmony. Once separated, he did not communicate with her and abandoned her. When she came to Shanghai to find him, the defendant avoided meeting her, putting the plaintiff in a desperate situation. The court served the defendant with the lawsuit, and the defendant also retained lawyers Lu Shaozong, Yu Zhong, and Luo Er to file a defense, denying the rape, and filed a counterclaim accusing her of false accusation. The court originally scheduled the hearing for yesterday afternoon. Both parties and their lawyers arrived in court, and the defendant's family members also attended the hearing. However, due to the large number of cases, it was not heard until 6 PM, so the presiding judge, Xiong Huiping, announced that the hearing would be postponed to 2 PM this afternoon.</p>

<p>The tenants of Hengfeng Lane on Shigaota Road, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai, are opposing the unreasonable rent increase by the landlord.

The landlords of the houses near the area have all reduced rents to show sympathy to the tenants, but the landlord of this lane not only refuses to reduce the rent but even increases it by as much as seven yuan. Although the tenants have repeatedly objected, all to no avail. Therefore, the tenants of the lane have now submitted a petition to the municipal government requesting a ruling.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, According to Mr. Zhang Jinyuan, the reconciliation situation in the defamation case between Jinyuan and Zhu Jifang, as reported in the local news column of the "Shen Bao" and "Shi Bao" on the 13th of this month, is clearly inconsistent with the facts. After Zhu Jifang filed a private prosecution in this case, Jinyuan also filed a counterclaim. Subsequently, after both parties explained clearly, they withdrew their lawsuits in court without any other apology conditions. Please correct the report by publishing a letter. Respectfully, Lawyer Yu Chengxiu, February 22nd.</p>

<p>Dear Reporter: Many difficult questions in the "[Reader Advisor]" column have been solved by you, and I now have a question that I would like to ask you to think about carefully and explain in detail. I am very grateful. I often hear that many young people cannot study because of poor family conditions, and I have never heard of anyone who is provided for but refuses to study deeply, but my brother is such a person. He has parents, two older brothers, and one older sister, and one younger brother. The older siblings have all received higher education, and the father and eldest brother are all working far away in Xinjiang Province. He is sixteen years old this year and graduated from Beijing Municipal Middle School last summer. He took the high school entrance exam twice but failed to pass both times. I am very worried about him, but I am working outside and cannot teach him every day, so I repeatedly wrote to him, telling him not to be discouraged and to prepare hard for the exam this summer, as he is still young. Sometimes when I go home, I earnestly tell him that a person must have rich common sense in order to make a living in the future, and this common sense must be obtained from books during the student days. I have cited many examples of famous people who suffered many hardships in their youth and later made amazing contributions to the country and society, and he agrees very much. But as soon as I leave, there are only his mother and his sister, who is still studying, at home, and he just doesn't listen to their teaching. He is restless and doesn't review his books. He feels that there is no fun in the family. Once he even joined the army on his own initiative, but after some effort, he was sent home again. He wrote to me saying that he was willing to work and study part-time, or to find him a job. I knew that he didn't want to study, so I didn't find him a job. I always hope that he can take advantage of the time when he is being provided for to obtain higher knowledge, or to learn a specialized skill, so that he can do something big in the future, so I advise him to cherish his youth, put in some hard work, and seek true advice, so that he will not have to worry about having nothing to do in the future, but he still doesn't seem to be aware! I am now asking you to answer the following points on my behalf: (1) His environment allows him to study, so why does he feel that studying is not interesting and want to find a job? (I have read the article in the "Shen Bao Monthly" about the problem of youth boredom). (2) How can I make him change his mentality of seeking a job and continue his studies? (3) Is it possible to allow his request and find him a job? I hope that you will take the trouble to answer the above three points on my behalf. (Reply will be published tomorrow)</p>

<p>The China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture</p>
<p>Business Will Cease</p>
<p>Affected by Deferred Payment of the Boxer Indemnity</p>
<p>(Beijing, 23rd) Ren Hongjun, the Director-General of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, stated that the foundation's self-operated and subsidized educational and cultural undertakings depend on the Boxer Indemnity for support. Last year, due to the suspension of the payment of the Boxer Indemnity, the operating expenses of various undertakings were borrowed from various banks and are urgently needed to be repaid. If the payment is suspended again this year, various undertakings will inevitably cease. The Boxer Indemnity that the foundation should receive is only more than 2 million yuan in national currency, which is very small for the government.</p>

<p>丨Provisionally Set Donation at 100,000 Yuan丨</p>
<p>March 1st to August 31st</p>
<p>Comrades in the Boy Scout community across the country, in view of the fact that modern self-defense weapons, especially aircraft, are the most powerful, and that if our Fifth Army, the 19th Route Army, had adequate aircraft to confront the enemy during the January 28th Incident, we would have been able to leave not even a single Japanese soldier behind, have suggested to the preparatory office of the National Boy Scouts of China and Vice President Dai Jitao to donate funds to purchase aircraft for the country to strengthen national defense. The General Assembly believes that this suggestion is indeed important and has passed the measures at the second preparatory meeting, which will be distributed to the party headquarters and councils of various provinces and cities for serious implementation by the national Boy Scout groups. The measures are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Measures A. Every Boy Scout donates at least two copper coins per day for six months. B. Every service member donates at least one yuan per month for six months. C. Every group donates at least two yuan per month for six months. D. The donation period is from March 1st to August 31st. E. The donation is reported by each group to the General Assembly once a month, and the General Assembly will deposit it in the bank. F. The donation is kept by a designated staff member of the General Assembly. G. The donation is provisionally set at 100,000 yuan. H. The purchased aircraft is named "[China Boy Scout No. ○]". I. In addition to the regular donation, service members and Boy Scouts may donate a special donation. J. Service members who donate a special donation of 20 yuan or more and Boy Scouts who donate a special donation of 10 yuan or more will be given a commemorative certificate as a token of appreciation. According to statistics, there are currently 760 Boy Scout groups, 3,905 service members, and 61,031 Boy Scouts in the country. The amount of donation is expected to be at least 100,000 yuan, which will be a small contribution to air defense equipment. <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>

<h3 id="e166">George Bernard Shaw's Remarks in Peiping <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Are Old Relics of the Imperial Palace More Important Than People's Lives?</p>
<p>Chinese Students Studying Communist Theories is Problematic</p>
<p>Why Bother Interviewing Me on Japanese Matters?</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) British literary giant George Bernard Shaw, who participated in the greatly beneficial around-the-world tour group, left Qinhuangdao on the Beining special train at 7:00 AM on the 20th, amid cheers from the crowd. He arrived in Peiping at 6:40 PM that evening. Accompanying him were over 130 male and female members of the world tour group. When the train arrived at the station, Shaw resided in compartment number 3, with his silvery beard shining brightly under the lights. A crowd gathered outside the train, vying to see his demeanor. Soon, Shaw, accompanied by his wife and attendants, alighted from the train. Shaw was wearing a light green raincoat, carrying two small leather cases, a camera, and a large leather briefcase. His wife was also carrying a fashionable large leather briefcase. After alighting, the receptionists sent by Zhang Xueliang, acting chairman of the Peiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, rushed forward to carry Shaw's belongings, but Shaw repeatedly said "No, no." He strode forward briskly, hand in hand with his wife, out of the station. At the same time, the members of the tour group also disembarked from the train one after another. Previously, the Pacific Railway Company had booked 80 rooms at the Beijing Hotel and arranged for over 60 cars to wait at the station. They immediately boarded the cars and went to the Beijing Hotel on East Chang'an Street to rest. Shaw stayed in room 305. Twenty-two Chinese and foreign reporters submitted their cards requesting to see him. Shaw, feeling tired from the journey, apologized to the reporters and introduced Miss Gaolun, secretary-general of the tour group, to discuss the time for the meeting. It was then agreed to meet at the ballroom of the Beijing Hotel at 9:00 AM on the 21st. At 9:10 AM on the 21st, seventeen Chinese and foreign reporters visited Shaw and were received in the ballroom of the Beijing Hotel, where he made the following remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Shaw's Remarks on Chinese Culture <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>I came to Peiping solely for sightseeing and to visit the world's famous ancient capital, with no other mission or purpose. Reports say the Sino-Japanese issue is serious, and Rehe is particularly tense, with Peiping and Tianjin also being in a dangerous zone in the future. My coming to China and traveling around during China's serious situation is different from the impressions of Europeans coming to China at ordinary times. Peiping is a magnificent and opulent old capital. If countries do not forget China, they should not forget Peiping. Japanese residents are preparing to return to their country, as if a great disaster is imminent. Chinese rich people are also moving south, as if Peiping can be abandoned. The property of the rich must not suffer the slightest loss. I don't understand what this means. Is the property of the rich more valuable than Peiping? The southward transportation of cultural relics from the Forbidden City adds a page to the cultural history of Peiping, as if the antiques are more important than the lives of millions of Peiping people. If we go to Italy to travel, all the antiquities from the Roman era still exist. I have never heard of Italy moving cultural relics east or west due to foreign aggression or internal strife. The Chinese people love peace. The Japanese also claim to love peace. But the peace the Japanese talk about is the peace after the result of war. The Chinese peace is peace within peace. Now the Japanese have declared to the League of Nations that the protection of Manchuria is their responsibility, and the invasion of Rehe is to protect the screen of Manchuria. They make aggressive invasion under the name of protection, regarding it as [self-defense]. China adopted a policy of non-resistance, and now they feel that the policy of non-resistance is not applicable, and they are changing to a policy of resistance, also regarding resistance as [self-defense]. I don't know when the self-defense movements of China and Japan will end. Some young Chinese students are interested in communist theories. Although the government has repeatedly ordered against it, the student elements are still complex. Communism is a political issue, but originally it was an economic issue. Now it has changed into a political issue. Whether communism is right or wrong is still a question worth studying. Russia first failed because it adopted absolute communism, and then changed to the New Economic Policy and implemented the Five-Year Plan. Now this plan has been declared successful. China is not easy to spread communist theories, and China does not have large capitalists. The issue of labor and capital is not yet a question for the Chinese academic community to study, so whether communist theories have power in China is not something I am happy to talk about. A few years ago, Beijing prohibited students from studying the Three People's Principles. After Peiping was settled, Peiping regarded students studying the Three People's Principles as good students, so whether a theory is right or wrong is entirely [time-bound,] not permanent. As for my sightseeing, I believe that Chinese monuments are unique historical materials in the world and have immense value in cultural history, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Busy Sightseeing, No Visits to Song and Zhang <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>When Shaw met with reporters, he did not recognize the seventeen reporters. After the explanation, he laughed and said, "Why bother interviewing me on Japanese matters? I came to Peiping for sightseeing and have no mission." When the reporters were leaving, a Russian reporter suddenly came, claiming to be a reporter stationed in Peiping for a certain newspaper. Shaw said, "[You are late. Students are deducted points for being late. Reporters who are late get no news.]" The Russian reporter said, "[Please forgive me.]" Shaw laughed and said, "[I am not a teacher, and it is not that I don't want to talk to you more, but because time is short,] please forgive me." At this point, reporters asked Shaw when he would visit Song Ziwen and Zhang Xueliang. Shaw replied that Mr. Song was busy with politics and finance, and he was busy visiting ancient monuments and famous scenic spots. Mr. Zhang had political knowledge and was clear about the international situation. His courageous spirit was reminiscent of his father. It was a pity that Mr. Zhang Zuolin was killed by the Japanese and could not save China from danger at this time. Because he was busy with sightseeing, he was afraid he would not be able to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang. As for the academic community in Peiping, who invited him to banquets, he could only thank them. At this point, Shaw shook hands with the reporters and said goodbye.</p>

<p>The British Empress of China ship arrived in Qinhuangdao from Shanghai late on the 19th. Because it was late at night, all the members of the tour group stayed on the ship overnight. The Beining Railway was ordered to specially prepare a special train, which was parked at the East Station of Qinhuangdao Wharf. At 10:30 AM on the 20th, all the members of the tour group left Qinhuangdao by special train to Peiping. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, they passed through Tianjin. George Bernard Shaw was sitting in the third compartment of the fourth carriage. Teachers, students, and newspaper reporters from Tianjin Beiyang Institute of Technology, Nankai University, and the Chinese and Western Girls' School boarded the train, crowding into the carriage to express their welcome to Shaw. Unexpectedly, Shaw ordered the porter to lock the compartment. All the welcome personnel came excitedly and returned disappointed.</p>

<p>Various Middle Schools to Improve Teaching and Training Management</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday instructed the principals of middle schools in the city, stating, "According to Order No. 1261 of the Ministry of Education, a review of the results of the recent middle school student graduation examinations in various provinces and cities shows that a large number of students failed. This is due to the uneven level of students, but the poor management and teaching of schools in peacetime are also a major cause. When students first enter school, there is not much difference in their academic ability. If the managers can pay close attention to teaching and guidance in peacetime, students will progress gradually, and their grades can at least reach the minimum standard. However, most middle schools today follow old ways in teaching, neglect training and management, and pay little attention to checking academic performance in peacetime. Or, the selection of teaching materials is inappropriate, or teachers and teaching materials are changed frequently, and there is no connection between them, all of which can lead to a decline in academic level. Since this examination, the management performance of middle schools in various places has been clearly revealed. In addition to the grades of each school having been announced by the relevant departments in accordance with Article 11 of the Provisional Regulations for Middle and Primary School Student Graduation Examinations, the relevant departments should immediately investigate the number of students taking the examination in each school. If more than half of the students fail, the relevant departments should give each school a warning or rectification depending on the circumstances, ordering them to improve teaching and management. If the results of the next examination still do not improve, all public and private middle schools should be given more severe sanctions or closed down, so that the teaching efficiency of middle schools can gradually increase and live up to the state's aim of running schools and educating talents. This is our high hope." We hereby order all schools to be informed.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Football Friendly Match: Yu You Clashes with British Soldiers <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Result: 10 to 1</p>
<p>Yu You's Refreshed Lineup Shows Considerable Strength</p>
<p>The Yu You football team recruited new players and underwent rigorous reorganization, aiming to restore its former renowned reputation. Li Shiyou from Hong Kong, whose arrival in Shanghai had been publicized for a long time, has joined Yu You, revitalizing their lineup. This Sunday, Yu You will face a strong opponent, Noakes, at the Chinese baseball field. To consolidate their lineup and prepare for the upcoming battle, they arranged a friendly match yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM against the British Army RASC (Royal Army Service Corps – Specialist Volunteers) stationed in Shanghai at the Chinese baseball field. More than two thousand fans, eager to witness the new lineup, attended as spectators. The match resulted in a decisive 10-1 victory for Yu You. Their performance was remarkable. Li Shiyou's right wing proved to be an excellent addition. Throughout the game, the British Army was consistently under Yu You's pressure. Were it not for Wang Caigao's "own goal," the entire British team would have been utterly defeated.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Four Consecutive Goals <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The two teams faced off, exchanging attacks for several rounds. Li Shiyou unleashed his speed on the east side, penetrating deep into the defense. With a cross pass, Chen Guangyao received the ball, sending it towards the goal. Hu Youcheng slid in, opening the scoring. After the restart, Sun Jinshun, taking advantage of an unguarded moment, launched a solo attack, scoring a goal. Soon after, Sun’s foot again penetrated the enemy's territory. Li Shiyou assisted by hooking the ball, sending it in lightly for another goal. The momentum of Yu You was overwhelming. The British soldiers desperately defended, panting rapidly. Sun Jinshun dribbled straight ahead, and Xi Qiaosheng emerged as a hidden force, scoring another goal.</p>
<p>[P Losing a Goal&gt;</p>
<p>The Navy, conceding four goals in a short period, were filled with indignation and launched a retaliatory offensive.</p>
<p>They charged several times, but the defense led by Lao Xie (nicknamed Old Crab) Rao Huisheng and Xiao Xie (nicknamed Little Crab) Ye Jinming was impenetrable. The left wing, Lat, evaded Shi Jinsheng and charged past Rao Huisheng. Bao Nai lifted his foot to kick the ball away, but Wang Caigao crouched down hoping to save it, but unexpectedly, Ha Yin arrived, bouncing the ball off Ha Yin's body and rolling it into the net.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Three More Goals Scored <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>At this time, Yu You's momentum was unstoppable. Their forwards were remarkably fierce and brave. Sun Jinshun repeatedly launched attacks, once dribbling straight up to the 25-yard mark and shooting from afar, achieving a remarkable goal. Li Shiyou launched another attack from the flank, rushing to the line and sending a beautiful cross to the goal. The "locomotive" Chen Guangyao arrived and headed the ball into the net. Five minutes before halftime, Sun Jinshun scored another goal, making the score 7-1 at halftime.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Not Seeking More <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The second half began, and the British army's strength was waning.</p>
<p>Their play was disorganized. Only Yu You's players were seen running everywhere. Li Shiyou opened the scoring from 15 yards out, followed by Hu Youcheng's charge for another goal, and Xi Qiaosheng smoothly added another, making it ten. Yu You was content and didn't seek more goals, so the game became less intense and less exciting, not worth elaborating.</p>

<p>Starting at 8 PM at St. John's University</p>
<p>The Fan Wang Du basketball team, a combined team from the middle school affiliated with St. John's University, coached by provincial coach Sullivan, possesses exceptional strength. In their previous match against the Shanghai Basketball Association's West Qing team, they lost narrowly by only four points despite being the better team, which demonstrates their prowess. The team will play a friendly match against the Eagles tonight at 8 PM in the St. John's University gymnasium. The Eagles, with players like Kong Guangyi and Lin Zequn, are also strong. It should be a very watchable game.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Refuting the Absurd Claim that China Has No Culture <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ruhui</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, the newspaper reported that the British playwright and literary figure George Bernard Shaw arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong, and the city's celebrities, journalists, academics, and artists gave him a warm welcome. After landing, he went to the World Society, where he was met by Mei Lanfang for a discussion. Shaw's tone was quite sharp, and Mei was unable to effectively counter his arguments. Shaw criticized Chinese opera for having noisy percussion, and Mei replied that while Peking opera had such noises, Kunqu opera did not. This response was clearly a retreat, acknowledging the flaws of Peking opera. Couldn't Shaw have countered that Kunqu also has percussion? I don't know how Mei would have answered that. It was like a fight where there was no exchange of blows, so Shaw made the statement that China has no culture. I don't know if Shaw was referring to Mei personally or to China as a whole. I want to tell Shaw that percussion originated in China during the Tang dynasty and was often used in ensemble with string and wind instruments. During the Jiaqing era of the Qing dynasty, a set of "ten-part music" was added to the imperial banquet music. There were ten sizes of gongs and more than a dozen sizes of drums. The surviving scores contain eighteen sets, with four main categories of sounds: wind, string, plucked, and percussion. The instruments are numerous, and the percussion instruments create complex and harmonious sounds, vastly different from ordinary folk music. Also, historical records from the Tang dynasty state that Emperor Ming of Tang himself conducted a large musical performance in the garden using a kettledrum, causing all the flowers to bloom, which shows the value of percussion. I hope that Shaw will not make such incomplete arguments in the future, and I also hope that Mei will read more ancient books and conduct fundamental research, and not boast about his thirty years of theatrical life, because performers thirty years ago were mostly uneducated and lacked skill. Their qualifications and status cannot be compared to those of today's performers. Doesn't Mei know this? I say this not only for Mei's sake, but for the sake of all those who bear the responsibility of culture. As for rural culture, Shaw did not specify what its state is, which is puzzling. So, where does China's true culture lie? Four thousand years ago, there was a specific term called "sound education" (also known as ritual and music), which encompassed everything from national ceremonies to social interactions, as well as scholars reciting, vendors doing business, and even beggars begging for food. Shaw's so-called "natural culture" is likely to be found here, not elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Eating <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>丨Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating丨</p>
<p>Eating is both the most difficult and the easiest thing. Why is it the most difficult? As the ancients have already said, "Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating," which is a golden saying. Why is it the easiest? With specific reasons, eating becomes the easiest thing. For example, newborn babies and old people nearing their end, who doesn't know how to eat? So eating is the easiest thing in the world, that is irrefutable proof.</p>
<p>The theory of relativity of eating has already been established today. Look at the officials in government, the staff in large stores, and various agencies. Who isn't holding a position, carrying a rubber rice bowl, and eating until their faces are round like Wuxi clay figurines? If you check their resumes, they are not graduates from prestigious universities, but rather the little brothers of concubines or the uncles of respected ladies. Family connections are naturally more powerful than any graduation diploma.</p>
<p>The methods of eating are ever-changing. The skill of holding a rice bowl is infinitely subtle and can only be truly understood and mastered by the individual, and cannot be described by my humble pen. In short, the art of eating is more important and wonderful than any other art. Unless you are friends who practice abstinence from grains and consume only air, who can afford not to explore the art of eating! After all, we Chinese people have studied the art of eating thoroughly. Even if our stomachs are narrow, the more rice bowls, the better. Holding only one bowl in hand is not enough to satisfy us. We might as well reach out and snatch other people's bowls. One bowl, two bowls, three bowls, four bowls... as long as we are full, caring about other people's hunger is foolish.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a custom where beggars barge into restaurants. After eating their fill but unable to pay, they simply kneel respectfully on the street for an hour or two, and then they can leave without trouble. Some people laugh at them, but in reality, most people in the world only have food to eat if they kneel. There is no need to laugh at the beggars! In the past, a fallen nobleman was said to have begged for food with a golden rice bowl, which was considered a joke. In fact, many modern youths suffer from this problem, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Mysterious Transactions <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>丨One of Society's Ailments丨</p>
<p>"Use my money to exchange for your goods." This is the fundamental principle of trade, which is such a just and open thing. Look at the many large corporations with neon lights and banners proclaiming great discounts, and every one of them is thronged with people. Even the vendors selling peanuts, carrying small bamboo baskets and raising their voices like bamboo poles, have many customers. They are openly buying and selling, and no one can deny that. However, in Shanghai society, perhaps because it is overly civilized, there are many transactions that have a mysterious air about them. If you don't believe me, look at the following examples!</p>
<p>During the day or night, if you happen to walk along North Sichuan Road, especially the area where Qujiang Road borders the Chinese and foreign concessions, you will see many men in short clothes standing near the utility poles. They are wearing peaked caps at an angle. In a Chinese-style jacket with a Western suit jacket, they are densely stationed like sentries. When they see young men, especially sailors from warships, they stick close behind you, muttering, "Western miss, Japanese miss, beautiful looks, cheap prices, you can choose whatever you want."</p>
<p>As you walk south along Sichuan Road, reaching the famous Fourth Road (Fuzhou Road), you will always see many dark-skinned, shabbily dressed old men standing under the eaves. If you call them beggars, they don't ask you for money. If you call them vendors, they aren't carrying any goods. However, as long as someone walking by glances at them, they will come forward, listing a whole series of Western "girls" and Japanese nude photos. They will even tug at your sleeve and ask you to go into the alley to look at samples.</p>
<p>As you continue walking south and enter the French Concession, you will pass through several famous alleys, such as Baoyu Lane. If you are well-dressed and look energetic, someone will come up to you and ask, "Sir, the tables are open again, would you like to go have some fun?" If you look darker and more dejected, then another type of person will greet you with a different pitch: "Sir! Cold medicine for relief, clean rooms, four coppers a box."</p>
<p>These are all transactions, but they are furtive and carry a mysterious air about them. They fully demonstrate the decadence of society. Now, let me add two more types of transactions: one is the forced sale of human flesh, and the other is the habit of selling without buying. These two are also quite peculiar and mysterious. If you walk along a busy road at night, and if you are dressed in a rural style, I guarantee that you will be surrounded by prostitutes selling flesh and poison. They will use a forced rape-like and enticing method to drag you in. Even if you don't want to do anything, they will still force you to spend a few cents before you can escape. Whether on walls or utility poles, you will find a few crooked and slanted red papers, especially in winter. These are advertisements for selling treatment for severe colds. I think this kind of transaction is only one-sided. If someone were to buy it, it would be a great joke and make people laugh their heads off!</p>

<p>— Fen Shi</p>
<p>Recently, the water shortage problem has caused an uproar in the city. Analyzing the root cause, the water from the water company comes from the Huangpu River, which belongs to China and costs nothing. Now, the company is arbitrarily raising prices and forcibly cutting off the water supply. Therefore, I ask the water company respectfully about the "tap water":</p>

<h3 id="e189">The Landlord <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Third Son! Come over and see Brother Zhao off!" Another group of people poured out from the back room, all in short clothes and narrow trousers, bareheaded, wearing boots, each holding a weapon, some with spears, some with single-edged swords, and two children about ten years old mixed in. Everyone was smiling, walking excitedly onto the square. The spirit of ancient Chinese warriors was still fully preserved here!</p>
<p>As soon as the landlord finished shouting, a middle-aged man in his forties threw down his weapon and ran over.</p>
<p>"Brother Zhao! Don't say such things!" The Third Son had already taken his father's place in supporting Brother Zhao. "Haha! What's the use of money? You're sick and can't work. We should be giving you more money, not talking about owing it. Brother, if you need money, just send your wife over to ask for it! We have rice too! Everyone in the village is family, why distinguish between you and me? Haha! Goodbye! Forgive me for not seeing you off!"</p>
<p>"You treat us too well, Landlord!" Brother Zhao clasped his fists, tears streaming down his face.</p>
<p>"Take care of your health!" The landlord sighed deeply, turned around, and stepped quickly into the ranks of the warriors.</p>
<p>The sounds of shouts and swords clashed with the roaring of the six fierce dogs. They immediately felt ashamed and dropped their golden, silk-like tails, scattering in six directions out of the woods. Only the mangy dog remained lying in the shadow of the setting sun, continuing to admire his masters' military exercises.</p>
<p>"Little Ling! Why can't you ever get it right?" The landlord straddled a huge stone lock as if riding a horse, with his broadsword planted in front of him, the breeze blowing and his long beard constantly brushing against the hilt. The one being scolded was his grandson, a twelve-year-old boy. Little Ling was using a long spear. Probably because he didn't have enough strength, the spear often fell from his hands when he sparred with others. Because of this, the landlord was quite annoyed that he wasn't working hard enough. (2)</p>
<p>"Perform it again! How can you fight the Japanese like this?" Little Ling's father, the landlord's second son, also felt that Little Ling was letting him down. He flicked Little Ling on the forehead, ordering him to perform again alone, and at the same time using the shocking words "Japanese devils" to motivate him. (2)</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Glass Rooms of Paris <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows what "glass rooms" are. In Paris, they exist on almost every street corner. They have no other identification except for stained-glass windows and a scarlet door light, which burns all day and night, emitting a dazzling ray of light.</p>
<p>They are the public brothels of Paris. The prostitutes inside are, of course, different from those who stand guard on the streets. Among them, there are also ranks, depending on the quality of the brothel. However, they all have one thing in common: cleanliness and hygiene. They must be inspected twice a week by the health bureau, and those with diseases can no longer stay in the brothel to entertain guests. Therefore, customers no longer run the risk of contracting diseases.</p>
<p>When you press the door button, the bell inside rings "ding-dong, ding-dong". A hostess immediately leads the visitor into a room. Inside, there is a row of standing prostitutes. They are all nude, allowing visitors to appreciate their beautiful bodily curves. Once he has made his selection, she leads him to a bedroom. Regardless of the brothel's quality, the rooms are all elegantly and beautifully furnished. Sanitary equipment is all available.</p>
<p>Hygiene is also something they pay close attention to, so they inevitably examine or wash the guests. Here, there is no such thing as emotion, only sexual desire. However, the length of stay varies. The more money given, the longer the stay. Overnight stays are also possible. Both long and short stays have fixed prices, with no deception. A short stay is fifteen minutes and costs about fifteen francs (equivalent to three Chinese dollars), which is the price for an ordinary brothel. A more expensive one costs more than fifty francs (ten dollars or so). The reason why these brothels are expensive is partly because the prostitutes inside are younger and more beautiful, and partly because the furnishings inside are particularly exquisite.</p>
<p>The establishment of glass rooms has many benefits: hygiene, simplicity, and satisfying men's sexual desires. These are all essential elements for preserving national health.</p>
<h3 id="e191">A Young Man's Troubles <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Dong</p>
<p>He is an eighteen-year-old youth. He has beautifully shaped eyebrows and very bright eyes. His teeth are not perfectly aligned, but they are very white. Tall stature, solid skin. All together, he is undoubtedly a handsome man.</p>
<p>He has money; studying at a certain university in Shanghai costs several hundred dollars a year. Therefore, in terms of material possessions and academics, he feels satisfied. He has never shown any unhappy emotions. On the ship returning from abroad, he sometimes meditated alone on the deck, sometimes chatted with a young woman in the officer's cabin. Although his appearance was always smiling, his heart revealed an unspeakable melancholy. One day, his secret was revealed to me by a third party. It turned out that he was a young man with marital worries. His father had arranged a marriage for him when he was not yet five years old. Because he had grown up in Southeast Asia, he had not yet met his fiancée. But according to information gathered from various sources, she was neither attractive nor had she attended school. Therefore, this young man's mind was often filled with the serious question of whether or not to marry her.</p>
<p>Needless to say, his body and mind had been baptized by modernism. Marrying a woman he did not know and had no feelings for, wouldn't that conflict with modernism? At the same time, wouldn't that endanger his lifelong happiness? But how could he not marry her? His family had already issued two or three ultimata, saying that if he did not marry the woman they had arranged for him, they would resort to force. The so-called forced method was to cut off his financial support.</p>
<p>Under this threat, the young man was truly embarrassed. Furthermore, the woman's family repeatedly urged them to get married, which made him feel that his dark future was drawing closer day by day. He considered this problem for three days. Finally, he said to me with a resolute attitude: "Mr. So-and-so, this time when I go back, I will definitely find a way to see that woman. If she's good, I'll marry her. If not, I'll have to find another way, and maybe I'll have to ask you for advice again."</p>

<h3 id="e192">Grasping Several Important Issues <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Qiu</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists have launched another all-out offensive on Jehol. This fact is not surprising, because in essence, it is only a continuation and expansion of the aggression and atrocities of the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, and it is inevitable given the military and political perspectives that the Japanese imperialists will not allow Jehol to remain under the setting sun. What should we do about this continued and expanded aggression? Our answer is: resist, fight, wash away blood with blood, and give back tooth for tooth!</p>
<p>However, there are several problems standing in the way that we must firmly grasp!</p>
<p>First, the significance of this struggle cannot be sought solely from empty terms such as "nation" or "ethnicity," but should be based on the larger topic of "anti-imperialism" and its historical mission. Our weapon is a "national revolutionary war," and our goal is to "overthrow imperialism!" This struggle is not only for the liberation of our nation, but for the entire world, for the future of history. Second, launching a national revolutionary war naturally requires the formation of a broad "national united front" and total mobilization of the entire nation. But we also recognize that those who are severely oppressed have a stronger will to resist and greater fighting power, so we believe that in the current national revolutionary struggle against Japanese imperialism, we must not neglect the help of the most oppressed "laboring masses."</p>
<p>Third, since the Nineteenth Committee passed the entire draft report, perhaps many people could not help but cheer and celebrate, believing that this was a "victory of justice" and "international assistance." In reality, if we do not deliberately ignore the fact that the British ambassador to Washington, Lindbergh, proposed to the US State Department that Singapore be used as a US naval base in exchange for war debt negotiations and an economic conference, and the fact that Washington is actively promoting war debt negotiations and an economic conference, then we can see that the League of Nations' attitude towards Japan has suddenly become slightly more assertive, entirely due to war debt negotiations. People are calculating their own interests, but we think it is a "victory of justice." This kind of mistaken understanding is as base, shallow, and meaningless as begging the League of Nations for help!</p>
<p>Grasping the three important issues mentioned above, grasping the weapon of national revolutionary struggle, is necessary; otherwise, we will not know why we are fighting and why we are dying!</p>
<h3 id="e193">Letter from the Countryside near City L <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wang Wanrong</p>
<p>Dear Jie:</p>
<p>I arrived in City L safely yesterday and spent the night at my aunt's house in the city. This morning, I took off my cheongsam, removed my scarf, put on the blue cloth gown my aunt had prepared for me, and put on a woolen hat. Looking in the mirror, ah! Jie! I really look like a complete country youth! You know, if I didn't disguise myself like this, I wouldn't be able to go home. I would be taken to the mountains by bandits halfway there.</p>
<p>My home is more than fifty li from City L. I set off at seven in the morning and arrived home a little after twelve o'clock. Walking quickly, I didn't feel cold. Unfortunately, the snow on the road melted slowly in the sunlight. Wearing the pair of worn leather shoes my cousin lent me, it was really difficult to walk. Otherwise, I could have arrived home an hour earlier!</p>
<p>You all go home to enjoy family happiness, to be spoiled by your mother, and to set off firecrackers with your younger brothers. What about me? I have no parents, who can I be spoiled by? I also have no innocent younger siblings, only two imposing older brothers. I have several nephews too, although they are all under ten years old, they all know how to shoot guns. This time when I go home, there's really no joy at all!</p>
<p>As soon as you open the door here, there is a mountain. There are wolves on the mountain. Listening to the wolves howl while lying in bed at night is the most interesting thing. When going up the mountain, rabbits often run down. When I see them, I chase them. They perk up their ears, their ruby-like eyes twinkling as they run into the woods. If I get angry, I just need to take the gun off my shoulder, aim, and bang!</p>
<p>Then there would be a delicious rabbit to eat that day. But I really can't bear to use such vicious methods on such lively and lovely little animals, ah! It would be better to just kill someone!</p>
<p>This year is considered peaceful. There haven't been any major incidents in this area recently. We should be able to have a peaceful New Year. Let me tell you about some of my past life experiences: The houses here all have high black walls and six or seven large doors. When I was five years old, a large group of bandits surrounded my house. My father knew he was outnumbered, so he opened all the doors and said loudly, "Anyone with courage, please come in!" The bandits thought there must be some kind of defense inside, so they all quietly slipped away. Little did they know, my father was singing an empty fort strategy!</p>
<p>One night four or five years ago, I was awakened by a burst of barking. I quietly peeked outside through a crack in the window. Ah! It was terrible! A large group of bandits had come again, holding bright torches in their hands. I woke up my older brothers and sisters-in-law (my parents had already passed away at that time), and we held our guns and shot down through the window slits. The bandits also fired back. Bullets whizzed over our heads. As a result of this fierce battle, four bandits were killed. I can't remember who killed them. The rest all ran away. The next morning, when I looked in the mirror, it was terrible! A large patch of hair on top of my head was burnt!</p>
<p>Another year, I was studying in the city! Many bandits had set up camp near our village and often came out to rob houses. My eldest brother and many villagers fought with them. As a result, my eldest brother was captured. The bandits wanted us to redeem him with 50,000 yuan early the next morning. Where would we get so much money? That night, the whole family decided to fight the bandits. Actually, everyone knew in their hearts that not only would we not be able to rescue my eldest brother, but we might all die in the hands of the bandits. But none of us said a word of timidity. After walking a short distance, we saw a red glow in the distance, and the sound of shouting and killing. At first, we thought the bandits were prepared. When we got closer, we realized that the bandits were fighting with the security team from another village. My eldest brother was lying deep in the woods, moaning. Jie! It turned out that the bandits saw the security team going to attack them. They thought they were going to rescue my eldest brother, so they stabbed my eldest brother a few times and left him to fight. That's why my eldest brother was lying in the woods, moaning. The next morning, the bandits had all fled. We went to see the bandits' residence. In the large manor house, there were more than a hundred cotton quilts and a dozen water buffaloes left behind. Since then, the bandits haven't visited for a long time. My aunt has repeatedly advised us to move into the city, but my sister-in-law can't bear to leave those high mountains, those streams, those peach trees, those taro fields. As for me? I also think we shouldn't be too timid and let the bandits occupy this beautiful village for nothing.</p>
<p>I really can't get used to life at school. The Suzhou girl at the same table always laughs at my large appetite. One day, when we were studying sociology, we went to visit a model prison. On the way, we encountered a horse walking alone. The girls who trembled even when they saw dogs fighting were all terrified. I found it funny, so I went up and held the horse. Only then did they tiptoe past. They were really pitifully and laughably weak!</p>
<p>It's a pity there are no bandits this year. Otherwise, I would definitely ask you to come and stay here for a few days. Although you are also delicate, you like bravery and strength. Didn't you say to me at school? ["Yu! Have you eaten enough? Don't starve and lose strength, so you won't have the strength to kill bandits when you go back."] Jie, now I haven't lost weight, and my strength is still the same. But it's a pity there are no bandits to kill!</p>
<p>I can't get used to living in my old home. When the weather gets a little warmer, I'll come out again. Goodbye! Your friend, Yu. January 16, 1933.</p>

<p>"Climb down that tree, you look frightened," the black girl said.</p>
<p>"This is really an interesting thing," the nearsighted man said, now that he felt safe, he calmed down. "This is a conditioned response. I wonder if I could make a dog climb a tree?"</p>
<p>"Why would you want to do that?" the black girl said.</p>
<p>"Well, to make this phenomenon have a scientific basis," he said.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" the black girl said. "Dogs can't climb trees."</p>
<p>"If there hadn't been the imagined carp stimulus, I wouldn't have climbed either," the professor said. "How can I make a dog imagine a carp?"</p>
<p>"Introduce him to a few real carp first," the black girl said.</p>
<p>"That's very expensive," the nearsighted man said, frowning. "Dogs are cheap, if you buy them from dog thieves, or buy a batch when dog taxes are levied. Buying carp would cost a lot of money. I have to think carefully about it."</p>
<p>"Before you go," the black girl said. "Tell me, do you believe in God?"</p>
<p>"God is an abandoned and useless assumption," the nearsighted man said. "The universe is just a huge system of reactions produced by vibrations. If I tap you on the thigh, your knee will definitely shake."</p>
<p>"Then I'll tap you with my Nobel Carey; you better not do that," the black girl said.</p>
<p>"For scientific purposes, it is necessary to restrain the subject and prevent such obviously inappropriate subordinate reactions," the professor said. "But as examples of reactions produced by association, these are also quite appropriate. I have spent twenty-five years studying the effects of such reactions."</p>
<p>"Effects on what?" the black girl said.</p>
<p>"On the saliva of dogs," the nearsighted man said.</p>
<p>"Considered to be relatively intelligent?" she said.</p>
<p>"I am not interested in intelligence," he replied. "In fact, I don't know what it means, and there is no reason to believe it exists. My business is in learning things that people have never known before. I convey that knowledge to the world, thereby contributing to the collective of definite scientific truths."</p>
<p>"When the world is full of knowledge and no kindness, how much better will the world be?" the black girl said. "Don't you have enough brains to think of some appropriate way to discover the things you want to know?"</p>
<h3 id="e195">Remembering Wu Lake <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenfu</p>
<p>Since the spring breeze blew away the cold snowflakes, bringing wisps of fine rain, I can't help but think of the spring in my hometown, and remember Wu Lake. Wu Lake, although it is not as beautiful as West Lake, nor as vast as Tai Lake, its tranquility and simplicity have their own charm that makes people linger; moreover, it is my old friend of more than twenty years, my only comforter in lonely times.</p>
<p>Wu Lake is about thirty li northwest of the Oriental Grand Port planned and built by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. It only has simple clothes and a kind smile. If you can't stand the intense stimulation in the city, if you are tired of the sounds of cars, trams, carriages, and all other machinery, or if you feel that you have contracted the urban illness of neurasthenia, then you can appreciate the tranquil beauty of a place like Wu Lake.</p>
<p>What embellishes Wu Lake and adds to its beauty are the willows in the park and the five-story pagoda east of the lake. In the past, the park was called Parrot Island. Was it because it was surrounded by Wu Lake water and adorned with fragrant grass? Actually, I have never seen the shadow of a parrot there. Is it always because of the Tang poet's line "Fragrant grass lush on Parrot Island"? It made it get this irrelevant noun. In fact, this is also the habit of our compatriots. Don't you see the signs of "Rice Fragrance Village" everywhere? As if without such an elegant noun, it would be dull and colorless. The park being called Parrot Island is just a manifestation of this mentality.</p>
<p>At Wu Lake, we can appreciate the slow return of spring. When the fragrant grass on the ground gradually turns green, and the willow branches gradually turn tender yellow, spring is reporting its slow return here. Birds are playing welcome songs, willows are waving welcome flags, and the lake water is also showing a welcoming smile. Everything is welcoming the arrival of spring.</p>
<p>The best time is on a moonlit night, sailing a small boat, with one or two close friends, rowing oars, and swimming in Wu Lake. Wu Lake is generally round, and the moon in the sky is printed into the heart of the lake, reflecting each other, a piece of silver light, decorating the entire lake surface. When the oars are rowed to the center of the lake, it is really like breaking the bright moon in the water, the silver light is dazzling, and we almost suspect that we have rowed into the Milky Way. The willow branches brush the silver light, dancing gently, the thin clouds floating faintly, the shadow of the pagoda in the southeast can be vaguely identified, this is really a beautiful and quiet scene. Sometimes there is no moon, and dots of stars fill the sky. If you are afraid of the danger of rowing a small boat, then you might as well go to the park for a walk, look at the calm lake water, like a mirror, reflecting the dots of starlight, like pearls, like jewels, like thousands of points of affectionate tears, sprinkled all over the sky. On the grass, you can sit and lie down, listen to the faint singing of the lake water, and the conversation between the willow branches and the wind. Here, you can appreciate the secrets of nature, you can indulge in the embrace of nature, you can forget all your worries and depression. There is no urban noise here, and no ugliness of modern society.</p>
<p>Spring has returned to the human world. At Wu Lake, the willow branches may have changed from light yellow to tender green, and the lake water may still contain a faint smile. In Shanghai on this rainy night, I can't help but think of you. I wonder if, when the willow branches are dancing, the birds are singing, and the lake waves are smiling, welcoming the return of spring, can dear Wu Lake remember its old friend hundreds of miles away thinking of you?</p>

<h3 id="e205">Anglo-American Exchange Rates Both Trend Toward Hardening <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Due to the New York silver market being closed yesterday, foreign dispatches only reported London spot and forward rates narrowing by 1/875. The exchange rate only saw a one-cent drop between British pounds and US dollars. The Bank of England was generally satisfied. Therefore, the market opened flat. Initial bids were at 1 shilling, 8 pence and 1/875 for the British pound and 8.75 yuan for the US dollar. Afterward, news favorable to silver prices circulated, causing the market to harden. However, there was some tightening afterward. HSBC's listed prices rose by 1/25 but then leveled off slightly. Later, the trend seemed to improve again. US dollars for June delivery traded up to 8.9125 yuan. Ultimately, due to lack of confidence, banks intervened but the market continued to gradually harden. At midday close, US dollars for June delivery were difficult to sell at 8.925 yuan. The afternoon saw an even worse situation. Although there was a brief show of strength, sellers remained dominant. US dollars for the current month (June) were unwanted even at 8.9 yuan. Closing bids were at 1 shilling, 8 pence and 3/875 for spot British pounds, and 8.9375 yuan for US dollars. Banks such as Mercantile Bank, HSBC, Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger, and the American Oriental Banking Corporation all made gains. Among gold dealers, only the Banque Industrielle de Chine was blocked, and this was a relatively small number of banks blocked. The Bank of England was buying shillings, while Bombay was selling. During the day, the shilling saw a fluctuation of 1/875, and the US dollar saw a fluctuation of 3/125. The British-American exchange rate traded at 3/45 for May delivery. Banque Sino-Francaise bought shillings at 1.8046875 and sold US dollars at 8.93125 yuan. As a result of a day's trading, the shilling closed 1/875 stronger, and the US dollar closed 1/875 weaker, compared to the previous close. The daily inflows and outflows of banks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>British Pound: Morning opening bid for spot was 1 shilling, 8 pence and 1/875. Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger sold Bank of England February delivery at 25.

<p>Public Bonds Under Pressure from Both Bulls and Bears</p>
<p>Short Covering Drives Recent Surge</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange for public bonds was quite chaotic due to it being the last day of the month. Amidst the ongoing fighting in Jehol, prices struggled to rise due to short covering for the current month. During the morning's initial trading, demobilization bonds rose sharply, reaching a peak of 30.05 yuan. Afterward, price increases were more moderate. Bonds near the 20th issue mark saw gradual decreases of 0.12 to 0.2 yuan, while salt tax bonds rose by 0.15 yuan. This unstable situation was caused by the intense struggle between bulls and bears this month. In the afternoon's initial trading, most bonds from previous issues retreated by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, while consolidated salt tax bonds rose again by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The chaotic situation had truly exceeded the norm, with the trend seemingly dictated by the ups and downs of consolidated salt tax bonds. Although rumors were rampant after the opening in the afternoon, short covering remained aggressive. Northern bankers and retail investors were especially busy, pushing prices up several jiao. Bonds from the 19th issue saw a wild surge of 1 yuan this month, while consolidated salt tax bonds only rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. As a result, the situation changed again at closing. Demobilization and troop reduction bonds, which had already risen by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan this month, fell again by 0.25 yuan as Northern bankers sold off forward contracts. Therefore, most bonds that followed were weak, and salt tax bonds were especially sluggish, with both current and next month's contracts falling by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Trading was dominated by retail investors, with large players making few moves. Northern bankers were relatively busy. As a result of the market prices, bonds from the 18th issue and earlier fell by 1.5 yuan due to the large price gap. Spot demobilization bonds, which had not been actively traded recently, also fell by 1.5 yuan. The remaining futures contracts generally rose, with demobilization bonds for the current month rising by 1.8 yuan, and bonds from the 19th issue rising by 1.45 yuan. The rest only rose by 0.2 to 0.6 yuan, while salt tax bonds only rose by 0.05 yuan. The total trading volume was 9,708,000 yuan, including only 3,000 yuan in spot trades, with consolidated salt tax bonds accounting for 4,000,000 yuan, and demobilization bonds accounting for 1,500,000 yuan. The remaining bonds each accounted for several hundred thousand. Today's futures trading will only be for the month of March.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Erratic Yarn Market <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, with an erratic trend. The fact is that a portion of investors, with a small capital base, were preparing to hoard for a long time, and many were bullish. Therefore, the buying sentiment rose again when the market fell slightly. However, sellers, considering the urgent national crisis and their abundant inventories, tended to short sell. Therefore, the competition between bulls and bears was intense. However, the Yunnan and Sichuan merchants are currently purchasing spot yarn, which greatly stabilizes the buyers. If the demand continues steadily, the market may see a rebound of 200 to 300 taels. The biggest key lies in real sales.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Man-Marked Yarn Slightly Declines <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The man-marked yarn market opened flat</p>
<p>in the morning due to the US cotton market being closed. The market was generally calm, with a slight decline of 2 to 3 qian. After the second or third rounds of bidding, it was heard that spot sales were not significant, and the market closed lower, with all months declining by 5, 6, or 7 qian. The afternoon opening also declined by 2 to 3 qian. After the second or third rounds of bidding, the Sichuan and Yunnan merchants purchased over 1,000 bales of spot yarn, and the market sentiment suddenly tightened, with buying sentiment rising again. As a result, all months rose by 2, 3, or 5 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 24,400 bales. Sold: Mingde 650 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, Yichang 1,600 bales, Yiyu 850 bales, Yuantai 650 bales, Taichang 700 bales. Purchased: Dafeng 750 bales, Yuanda 550 bales, Changfeng 2,250 bales, Xincheng 1,250 bales. The closing prices were as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rose. However, due to the Washington's Birthday holiday in the US cotton market, market sentiment was calm, and the gold market was slightly weak. Therefore, business was not active, and market conditions were relatively soft. In the afternoon, the market situation suddenly tightened. It was generally said that the US cotton market had passed Smith's proposal to reduce planting for farmers who borrowed 3.5 million bales. It was expected that the US cotton market would rise, so buying sentiment suddenly increased. However, spot cotton transactions were very quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Zheng-Marked Yarn Shows Little Change <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The Zheng-marked yarn market opened</p>
<p>flat in the morning due to the US and Indian cotton markets being closed. Market sentiment was dull, and since this month was the last day, all months declined by 1 to 1.5 qian. The afternoon opening saw the current month decline by 2.5 qian, with distant months weakening. Unexpectedly, the market suddenly rose after the second or third rounds of bidding, with all months rising by 1.5 to 2 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 66,500 dan.

<p>Lower River Rice Supply Disrupted, Prices Firm</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's supply remained blocked, with no arriving ships. Only tugboats arrived with a limited amount of rice. Both urban and rural stores experienced sluggish demand, with orders of only 100-200 shi. However, due to the lack of supply and dwindling stockpiles in Pudong, the situation is improving. Market conditions are firm, but prices haven't changed much due to weak demand. Suzhou-Tong merchants, Qingjiao and Nangang rice are priced normally, while Chang merchants are slightly higher by 5 fen. Duyangjian is a middle-grade product, so prices are stable. Yin Yuan prices are slightly higher, while Bian Yuan prices are slightly weaker.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday's supply from the Lower River was limited. The stock of white rice in the river was still plentiful. Demand in the japonica rice stores slightly increased, pushing prices up slightly. The prices of thin indica rice were stable, while early rice increased slightly. Yang Du Bu Jian's market was slightly better, and prices were also trending towards stability. Customer-grade white rice also showed a stable trend.</p>
<h3 id="e221">New Saigon Rice Transactions <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Customer-grade Xiang Rice Arrives and Sells Actively... Capital Rice Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer-grade Xiang rice continued to arrive, but sales remained active, and the market remained firm. It was found that Fujian merchants still intended to continue to load freely, because last year's inventory in the port was insufficient. It is not cost-effective to order from the producing areas or to go to Southeast Asia to purchase and load, and the procedures are complicated. Therefore, it is more troublesome than purchasing in Shanghai. So there are still many who are willing to buy in the future. Because the purchase price is difficult to increase in that area, it is difficult for a big market to be cost-effective. The river rice on the national river street is quite inconvenient after changing to new casks. And there are not many with the same quality. The price of various yangdujian is even higher than that of lian. And there are transactions between four households, and there is a possibility that the buyers will continue in the future. But if the market is too high, then it will have to be held back by the jianduan from the lower rivers. A small amount arrived yesterday, and the demand was not as strong as the sun. Therefore, various red rice are stable. The Fuzhou branch of Tongshi purchased 500 packages of Jiangxi Ji rice and 488 packages of Hunan hong糙 rice. The Quanzhou merchants purchased 250 packages of Xiang Hongji rice. The rest were all processed by the wooden street. A total of 1,200 packages of Jiangxi Ji rice, 500 packages of Hunan Ji hong rice, and 488 packages of hong糙 rice were shipped throughout the day. The Nanjing Ce rice and Nanjing You rice are new arrivals from yesterday, and the quality is slightly lower. It is a little cheaper than the previous price of 1jiao</p>
<p>There had been no transactions for foreign rice for a long time. Yesterday, a street merchant purchased 200 packages of Saigon rice No. 1 from Jiaoli Foreign Bank, at prices of 8.77 yuan and 8.75 yuan, which was 300 to 400 yuan less than the previous week.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Dumping Continues</p>
<p>Marked Flour Becomes Increasingly Unstable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a firm trend in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations were slightly better by about 7 or 8 fen, and due to active spot sales the previous day, the market atmosphere for each month was stable. Although buyers were not very smooth, the trend seemed smart, better than the previous day's closing price by 2.5 to 5 li. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, each month initially continued to improve. The opening price for this month reached 1 tael, 8 qian, 3 fen and 2.5 li, but by the fourth round of bidding, the flat price for this month and the distant term fell again, because the spot price of foreign wheat was becoming cheaper, Australian wheat could be traded at 3 taels and 4.5 qian, Argentine wheat at 60 pounds, the price was 3 taels and 2.5 qian, and 63 pounds, 3 taels and 3.4 qian. If there is a huge amount, it can be loosened again. Therefore, inland factories and small and medium-sized factories in this port have thrown it out, and the market has fallen again. Given the endless dumping of foreign wheat, the future steps still need to be guarded against changes. As a result, this month was better than the previous day by 5 li, March was slightly better by 2.5 li, April was slightly better by 1.2 li, May and June were slightly better by 1.5 li, and July was slightly better by 1.2 li.</p>
<p>Wheat Market Before Delivery and Clearing</p>
<p>Recent Lowest Record</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed signs of stopping and being quiet. Because the Ministry of Communications has passed this month, buyers have mostly completed their business and are now planning their shipments. It is heard that Dingtai will have to deliver more than ten cars, but the rest have already been settled outside the market. However, at this point, it is certainly difficult for non-business people to take delivery, so the opening price was reduced by 2.5 qian, a further reduction of 1 fen from the previous day, which is the lowest record. Most of the long-term contracts are short sales, and there is no up or down in the market. However, the spot price of foreign wheat is extremely loose, and Argentina's inventory is abundant, so there will be no end to the dumping in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Sugar Market <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The Trend of Coarse Sugar and White Sugar Is Slightly Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had no huge ups and downs in the metal market, and the trend was flat. The guild's share price of four types of coarse sugar and white sugar was still 15 taels, 4 qian and 5 fen, and the high-quality RA stamp was 6 qian and 5 fen, but there were not many transactions. No. 20 medium sugar was 15 taels and 2 qian, and No. 18 was 15 taels and 1 qian. Dutch red sugar fluctuated slightly. No. 8 was 12 taels, No. 9 was 12 taels and 2 qian, and No. 10 was 12 taels and 4 qian. Taikoo's B stamp was 16 taels and 3 qian, CW stamp was 16 taels and 1 qian, DY stamp was 15 taels and 8 qian, HX stamp was 15 taels, 7 qian and 5 fen. The Chao merchants’ Huanggang Qing was slightly opened, and the price was similar to yesterday's. The Jian merchants opened 20 boxes of lion ball rice, each weighing 12 taels and 3 qian, which was 3 qian higher than before. Guangdong sugar arrived one after another. However, it was in the middle of a market downturn, and the transactions were very few.</p>

<p>The metal market has been very good recently. It turns out that merchants, factories, and building contractors have been buying it one after another. The number of transactions is very large. Therefore, the price of each item has the potential to remain unchanged. Standard, galvanized iron, tinplate, and white lead skins are also. Nearly thin and white. It turns out that the appreciation of these items is due to the lack of supply and low inventory. The trend of prices is that a 7-foot Red Sail brand is estimated at 1 tael and 1 and a half, while miscellaneous brands are 1 tael and 8 fen. A 6-foot Red Bird brand is 1 tael, while miscellaneous brands are 9 qian and 4 fen. Yesterday, fellow traders and four merchants, etc., saw that the arrival of goods could not be sold, so they went back to search for spot goods. Therefore, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened, and the prices also rose by two to three points. There were more than 13,000 deals in total. The next arrival is limited, and the market must rise again.</p>

<p>The factory purchased eight cars of soybean from the train. Due to the consecutive downward trends, the market sentiment in Shenshi softened. Bean cake factories did not produce much, and the market trend was tight.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaomei coal shops have been selling very well. Yesterday, they delivered 460 Shun. Hongqi Xiaomei is in short supply, and the price of high-quality goods has risen to 17 taels per ton.</p>
<p>After yesterday, Wuxi Baichang factory shipped 54 pieces of Jin Shuangying and other brands by train to be delivered to foreign banks at the end of the month.</p>

<p>The Authorities Arouse Soldiers to Prepare for a Lion's Fight</p>
<p>Moscow dispatch, 23rd The Soviet Russian authorities are now paying close attention to the Japanese army's actions in Rehe. Although this battle will not endanger the Russian army, Japanese political and military leaders have recently openly declared in newspapers that Japan must go to war with Soviet Russia, so Soviet Russia has to pay attention. The Russians believe that Japan's refusal to sign a non-aggression treaty with Russia is shocking. The Japanese News reported in an editorial that the Japanese army's actions are openly declaring war on China. Japan hopes that the victory of the Democratic Party in the US elections can reduce the American concern about Manchuria. In fact, it is not the case. Japanese-US relations are gradually deteriorating. Today's incident will raise the question of whether allowing Japan to blockade China is a US issue. The newspaper replied that Soviet Russia is committed to peace and does not want to interfere in the battles of imperialist countries. However, if imperialist countries attack Soviet Russia, hundreds of millions of armed workers are prepared to fight like fierce lions, prepared to sacrifice their lives, so that imperialist countries will never dare to offend socialist countries again. In addition, the Soviet Russian Pravda published a special edition to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, emphasizing that Soviet Russia is at risk of being attacked by capitalist countries and emphasizing the danger in the Far East. The Central Committee of the Communist Party, under the guidance of Stalin, has issued a warning that the "enemies" outside the Soviet Russian border are attacking the Soviet Russia. The troops are constantly arming themselves and preparing to extend their murderous hands to the borders of Soviet Russia. The Minister of Land and Sea, Voroshilov, also issued a warning, saying that the danger of invading Soviet Russia is now becoming increasingly clear. The Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Stalin, called on the Soviet Russian armed forces to thoroughly study the latest tactics in order to repel the enemy. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) An Englishman, Hicks, has been in China for more than 30 years. During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, he married a Chinese woman in Guangzhou and had three daughters in a row. Hicks was displeased and married a woman surnamed Lai in Hong Kong. Later, they came to Tianjin together. He worked in customs for more than 20 years, accumulated 1 to 2 million yuan, and then resigned. On the night of the 22nd, he suddenly shot and killed Lai in his residence at No. 35 Hong Kong Road. He placed the pistol in the deceased's left hand and calmly went to the British Municipal Council to report that his wife had committed suicide. On the morning of the 22nd, the British Municipal Council sent someone to examine the body and found that the direction in which the deceased's left hand held the gun did not match, which was obviously a murder. He was immediately detained. On the morning of the 24th, the British consul interrogated him. Hicks insisted that it was suicide but could not provide any evidence of suicide. The British consul scheduled to examine the body again on the afternoon of the 24th to determine whether he had been murdered. According to Lai's parents, Lai married Hicks at the age of sixteen and is now thirty-nine years old. At first, Hicks falsely claimed that he had no wife, so Lai rode in a bridal sedan. Later, she learned that he was a bigamist. Hicks was lustful and recently placed a maid in Beiping. Hicks often molested her, and Lai tried to dissuade him.

<p>Reuters telegram from Zhen, 23rd General Herzog, the Prime Minister of the South African Federation, has formed a trial method with General Smuts, the leader of the opposition party, to organize a mixed government. This is the most important development in South African politics in recent years. According to this agreement, Herzog will still be the head of the new government, but Smuts will also have an important position. The new agreement stipulates the dissolution of the parliament and does not submit a budget bill. The parliament will probably be dissolved in the middle of next week, and the budget bill will be the work of the new parliament. The general election is scheduled to be held in May, so the new parliament will be convened in about July. The political opinions of the two major political parties in South Africa are usually very different. The compromise reached by the leaders of the two parties is limited to broad principles. As for the cabinet positions, they have not yet been effectively distributed. The agreement also stipulates that the status of South Africa as part of the British Empire will be fully maintained, and there are also regulations on the indigenous people's problem, which has been in dispute in the past. Both Herzog's National Party and Smuts's South African Party are scheduled to hold political party meetings tomorrow. It is expected that this agreement can be passed.</p>

<p>TASS dispatch from New York, 23rd Eight hundred American professors, university presidents, and teachers, representing 268 universities and specialized schools in 45 states of the United States, recently submitted a petition to President-elect Roosevelt, requesting the United States to recognize the Soviet Union. The petition stated, "This is an indispensable step for world peace and the mutual economic interests of the two countries." Several people who signed this petition are famous American scientists and economists, such as Professor Meek, Director of the Wisconsin University Experimental College, Dr. Dewey, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, Mr. Nelson, President of Smith University in Massachusetts, Dr. Commons, Professor of Political Economy at the University of Wisconsin, Professor Hudson of International Law at Harvard University, Professor Williams of Political Economy at the University of Pittsburgh, and Professor Peterson of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Niebuhr, one of the initiators of this petition, said, "In the current emergency situation, the United States' failure to recognize the Soviet Union will seriously threaten world peace." He hopes that this petition will be enough to enhance the tendency of Americans to care about the League of Nations and to understand it, and that the government and parliament will take appropriate steps in response to the presentation of this petition.</p>

<p>Future Focus Will Shift to the Rehe Situation</p>
<p>Our Representative Will Ask the Assembly to Deal with It Conscientiously</p>
<p>The Nineteen Special Committee Advocates Expanding the Restructuring to Invite the U.S. and Russia to Participate</p>
<p>(Geneva) There will be a very important development when the League of Nations General Assembly meets on Friday. Its agenda has been agreed upon by the Nineteen Special Committee this afternoon. Chairman Hymans will deliver the opening speech at 10:30 tomorrow morning, explaining that he speaks on behalf of the entire Nineteen Special Committee, so other special committees will not speak again. After the Chairman's speech, the Japanese representative Matsuoka will be invited to speak. At that time, there will be a dramatic scene. Matsuoka will definitely announce Japan's position on "Manchukuo" in very strong terms, pointing out that the Rehe incident is an internal affair of "Manchukuo." Matsuoka may also blame the League of Nations for causing the crisis. It is also unknown. It is expected that Matsuoka will leave the meeting place before the vote without participating in the Nineteen Special Committee. Representatives who have not participated in the Nineteen Special Committee, such as the representatives of Venezuela, Lithuania, and Canada, will express their opinions one after another after Matsuoka's speech, but they all agree to keep their speeches brief. After everyone's speech, the vote will be taken. Then, Chinese representative Yan Huiquing will address the General Assembly, detailing the current situation, and especially on Rehe, there will be earnest remarks, asking the League of Nations how to deal with it well, so as to prevent repeated aggression. Then, the League of Nations General Assembly will ask the Nineteen Special Committee to propose measures to prevent repeated aggression, and discuss it at the next League of Nations General Assembly. The next General Assembly will be held on Saturday. It is heard that the Nineteen Special Committee advocates organizing another committee according to Article 3 of the League of Nations Covenant, which will be composed of twenty-one people, that is, the representatives of Canada and the Netherlands will be added to the former Nineteen Special Committee. However, it is also expected that some new people will join. Hymans has now explicitly stated that although he is willing for Belgium to have a representative to attend the twenty-one-member committee, he cannot participate in the future committee. This committee, when it is established in the future, will act on behalf of the League of Nations General Assembly. This is not a negotiation committee, because the negotiation committee can only be established after both parties accept the report. If a negotiation committee is established, the League of Nations will ask Russia and the United States to join, but the Nineteen Special Committee has also carefully considered the possibility of inviting Russia and the United States to participate in the twenty-one-member committee, feeling that it is easier to get the two countries to cooperate with the new committee than to ask them to join the Fifteen Special Committee. This is also one of the reasons why the Nineteen Committee plans to change to the Twenty-one Committee. This afternoon, before the adjournment, the Nineteen Special Committee reviewed and approved the opening and closing speeches that Chairman Hymans will deliver at the League of Nations General Assembly on Friday.

<p>Lytton Expresses Important Opinion</p>
<p>(London) Lord Lytton spoke about the situation in the East at a performance in Nawai, England, today, saying that stopping the export of arms would not cause any difficulty. He saw no reason why the UK should not supply China with arms, but supplying China with arms to prevent them from being obtained by Japan would not be easy. It is a crime for the government of a member state of the League of Nations to allow its people to continue to sell arms to a country, allowing it to continue what the world recognizes as an unfair war, especially since the League of Nations is bound by its own report and must provide all kinds of assistance to the other party.

<p>According to the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, the German Hitler cabinet will advocate for the complete return of the South Pacific mandate territories to Germany. The League of Nations also has the same idea. However, this claim was originally intended to alleviate the feelings of the German people regarding the issue of arms reduction. Currently, the German foreign authorities and influential figures are still unwilling to publicly discuss this issue. Dr. Huesner, a well-known colonial policy expert and former member of the investigative committee, has also not expressed his opinion. However, the general view of the German representatives is to take back the territories because Germany has no base in the East. If this territory is taken back, it will have a significant impact on Japan's military. Although Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will never easily give up its mandate over the South Pacific. Germany's strong desire to reclaim it will inevitably lead to conflict with Japan. At a time when Japan and the United States are facing off militarily, if Germany insists on demanding this territory, it will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, recently, discussions on this issue have been raging in Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Recent Developments in Soviet Urban Development - Moscow Correspondence <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Striving to Build, Rapid Population Growth</p>
<p>Cities and Villages Becoming Integrated</p>
<p>Since 1917, the development of Soviet cities can be divided into two periods: the first from 1917 to 1922, when people fled to the countryside due to food shortages and industrial decline; and the second from 1923 onwards, when industry developed, and cities flourished even more by 1926.</p>
<p>In 1921, the Soviet urban population suddenly decreased from 20 million to 16 million. This was the era of the Russian Revolution, when the entire country was surrounded by armed intervention from various countries and the White Army of the Tsar. All efforts were devoted to the struggle for survival. Due to a lack of raw materials, the total industrial output in 1920 was only 18% of the output in 1913, and the number of workers in industry had decreased to 43%. Excluding the Black Earth Belt (the main agricultural area of Russia), the urban population shrank by more than 35% between 1916 and 1920. The situation was even more severe in the central region. In other regions, the reduction was more than 27%. The population of St. Petersburg lost 62% from 1910 to 1920, returning to the level of half a century ago. Moscow reached the level of 1897. Moscow lost 175,000 residents, Leningrad lost 1.5 million, Baku lost 40,000, Dnipropetrovsk lost 50,000, Kharkov lost 25,000, Stalingrad lost 48,000, Samara lost 74,000, and Nizhny Novgorod lost 57,000.</p>
<p>In these years, Tashkent and other agricultural areas absorbed the people who fled from the cities, and the population in the countryside increased by 60% to 80% from 1917 to 1919.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of workers in large industries also decreased sharply, from 2,599,000 in 1913 to 1,585,000 in 1920. The 30 provinces of Great Russia saw a reduction of 30%. Moscow saw a reduction of 48% from August 1918 to July 1920.</p>
<p>In recent years, large industrial centers in the Soviet Union have experienced unprecedented development and prosperity. The number of cities with a population of over 100,000 has exploded, and medium-sized cities with a population of 20,000 to 40,000 are also growing rapidly. Most people are increasingly attracted to industry, and many cities in the Soviet Union are not only not lagging behind the pace of urban development in Europe and the United States, but are surpassing it.</p>
<p>For example, Detroit, the large center of the American automobile industry, only increased its residents by about five times in the 27 years from 1900 to 1927. In contrast, Stalingrad, the Soviet Detroit, more than doubled its population in just five years. Nizhny Novgorod (now renamed Gorky) increased its population by about four times in eleven years. Essen, the center of the German coal mining industry, only tripled its population in the 20 years from 1901 to 1920. In contrast, Shchëkino in the Soviet Union increased its population by six times in just eight years (from 1923 to 1931). During the same period, Makeyevka increased tenfold. Lyon, the large center of the French textile industry, only increased its population by one-fifth in the 26 years from 1900 to 1926. In contrast, Ivanovo in the Soviet Union increased its population by three times in eleven years.</p>
<p>If we do not talk about general figures, but examine individual cities, then the development of new Soviet cities is even more obvious. Here are a few examples to illustrate the general situation:</p>
<h3 id="e275">Novosibirsk During the World War, the city's <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>commercial turnover totaled 86 million rubles, and freight totaled 1 million tons. The main enterprises were flour milling, winemaking, and leather making. The two iron-making enterprises each had only 128 workers. In 1913, the city had a total of 21 industrial enterprises, with 1,138 workers and a total output of 8,359,000 rubles. In the four years of the first five-year plan, the city's industrial output increased by 600%, from 25 million to 154 million (by the end of 1932) rubles. The number of workers increased from 2,600 to 10,800, an increase of more than 400%. The average output per worker increased by 50%. The city has now decided to build a large integrated factory for manufacturing mining machinery (this factory started construction in 1931 and will be completed in 1934).</p>
<p>(Part of it,) a large factory for manufacturing textile machinery, and other large enterprises. The city now has 235,000 residents, compared to only 65,000 in 1913. It has five commercial vocational schools with 2,500 students, 29 scientific research institutions, 29 periodicals, 65 kindergartens, 26 nurseries, and 18 clubs. All other modern facilities, such as running water, mechanical laundries, cooking factories, new large residences, and wide streets, are being constructed one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Karaganda <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Before the revolution, the city was leased to the British for coal mining, and two or three worker dormitories were built. In the nomadic steppes of the Cossacks, there were only two or three small villages with 4,000 to 5,000 residents. But by 1930, the city had become the third largest coal industry center in the Soviet Union, with an annual output of 700,000 tons of coal. The population suddenly increased to more than 100,000, including 40,000 cadres. In 1931, the city was equipped with hospitals, clubs, power plants, and radio stations. During the second five-year plan, the city decided to develop into a new socialist city.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Almaty <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>The capital of Kazakhstan, in the past this city was a concentrated city of local tyrants and bureaucrats. In the meantime, the number of residents has tripled (50,000 in 1929, increasing to 150,000 in 1931). The city's cultural and economic construction plan budget for 1932 reached 45 million rubles, of which housing expenses accounted for 7.5 million, administrative agency construction expenses reached 9.5 million rubles, industrial expenses accounted for about 6 million, cultural and educational expenses accounted for 8.2 million rubles, health expenses 1.5 million, and public welfare expenses 3.5 million rubles.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Luhansk <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>In 1910, the city had a total of 24,000 residents. Now it has increased to 170,000. It is estimated that in 1933, the construction of new factories and workers' quarters will increase by 20,000. The Soviet Union's new modern railway locomotive manufacturing plant, which ranks second in the world, is located in this city. There is a long list of such rapidly developing new modern cities in the Soviet Union. Due to space limitations, only a brief mention is possible. However, from the above-mentioned places, one can imagine the development of other places.</p>
<p>Overall, from 1926 to 1932, the percentage increase in the industrial population of various national republics was as follows: Russia, 217.5; Ukraine, 153.6; Uzbekistan (only Tashkent), 259; Turkmenistan, 211. The development of Soviet industry, considering the previous backwardness of various national republics, and the average distribution of industry throughout the federation, resulted in such a widespread and rapid increase in the industrial population of various national republics. In the Tsarist era, the proportion of municipal expenditures compared to national expenditures was the lowest in the world. In the United Kingdom, this proportion was 90%, in Denmark, 87.2%, in Switzerland, 68.5%, and in Russia, only 8.5%. Even in this meager amount, the amount used in remote areas of various ethnic groups was even smaller. In the Tsarist era, the municipal facilities of Ukraine, the so-called most advanced, had running water before the European War, but its main city, Kiev, according to the chairman of the city council, Joseph, said in a speech at the first congress of representatives of the whole city in 1913, that the city's electricity and trams were only enjoyed by the [middle] class, to put it bluntly, by rich people. [I have never seen a small house with electric lights. I have never seen a worker on the tram]. However, in today's Soviet Union, major constructions such as running water, sewers, trams, and electric lights are all set up in workers' areas. With the development of industry, a whole new city has been created.</p>
<p>In the past four years, the total investment in public welfare undertakings in the Soviet Union has reached approximately 20 billion rubles, and the construction cost of new housing has reached 35 billion rubles.</p>
<p>Compared with those before January 1 of the same year, the new houses added at the end of 1932 increased by 95% in Nizhny Tagil, 90% in Kuznetsk, 83% in Shakhty, 80% in Berezniki, 70.7% in Chelyabinsk, and 40% in Novosibirsk.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we see that the residents in the centers of large cities in Western Europe are sharply reduced, and almost all housing construction has completely stopped. A large number of unemployed people have moved out of their homes because they cannot afford to pay the rent.</p>
<p>The compilation of the second five-year plan is guided by the principle of eliminating the opposition between cities and villages, that is, determining [the future industrial development] route of national construction, and creating new industrial centers in rural areas, so that the differences between cities and villages can be gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>Under this policy, not only has industrial construction been evenly distributed according to the national region, but also on the basis of state-owned farms and collective farms, machine tractor stations have been widely established in rural areas, becoming the center for the implementation of agricultural mechanization.</p>
<p>Therefore, during the second five-year plan period, due to the expansion and development of the machine tractor station network, the widespread and in-depth agricultural mechanization, and the large-scale construction of industry in backward areas, the distinction between cities and villages will be eliminated in the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3 id="e280">We Hope the Government Can Be a Wen Tianxiang <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>We Must First Hope the People Can Be a Han Wudi</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce today issued a letter to the national chambers of commerce, stating: "Since the Shenyang Incident, we have lost three provinces by making concessions step by step, a painful history unprecedented since the beginning of border disputes. The whole country is saddened. Although the patriots and people of insight in the three provinces have risen up in the wilderness to fight against the enemy, advancing one after another, they have ultimately been unable to save the crisis in the three provinces. Why? Foreign wars value concentrating strength and unity of the whole country. Relying solely on the people to fight on their own will lead to a scattered situation and weak backing. It is really not enough to withstand the full force of a strong enemy. For more than a year, the government has devoted its full energy to diplomacy, hoping to recover the lost territory without war. However, the enemy's arrogance is growing, and their plans are becoming more urgent. They have even included the territory of Jehol in their grasp, plotting to gradually divide it, leading China to a sinking state. Therefore, the government, unable to endure it any longer, authorized the North China military authorities to concentrate their troops and make a last-ditch effort. Premier Song himself made trips to Beiping and Chengde to plan military supplies and慰勞the soldiers. At the same time, he wrote to the League of Nations to明[ming]　旭[xu]　　　　　哥[ge]　conclude the depressed and contradictory situation of the past year. [From then on], the national anthem will take a tragic path. The people and the government are in the same boat and cannot simply hold an attitude of watching the fire from the other side and stand purely in a position of criticism and onlookers. Therefore, the people should urge the government before it decides on a major plan of resistance against Japan, and the people should fully support the government after it resolves to carry out resistance against Japan. The actions of the invading country are the crystallization of its decades of policy. The mobilization of 60 million people should be repaid by the efforts of our 400 million people. Save on food and clothing, endure hardships, and save every bit to use for supporting the army and resisting Japan, so that morale is always fresh and the front is stable, or it can save the crisis and cause the aggressor to realize the truth. We hope that the government can be a Wen Tianxiang, and we must first hope that the people can be a Han Wudi. Merchants are at the forefront of destroying their homes to relieve the country's difficulties. We are willing to take on the responsibility of giving up large and difficult tasks with the spirit of not shirking responsibility. National feelings, the golden cup is forever solid, which is the duty that our country's merchants should fulfill today. Let us encourage each other."</p>

<p>Regarding Public Security in this City,</p>
<p>the Japanese side, in view of the fact that during the last Shanghai War, Japanese浪人 disturbed public security everywhere, which was criticized by the international community, is paying more attention this time. Therefore, on Monday afternoon, a meeting was convened at the Japanese Consulate to discuss the issue of maintaining public security. At that time, in addition to Japanese Consul Ishisha Yu, Japanese Naval Commander Sugisaka, and the police authorities, important figures of the Japanese community, such as Funatsu, were also invited to participate. According to the announcement by the Japanese side, it was decided that although the war in North China has occurred, Shanghai should remain quiet as usual. Naval warships and naval landing forces should all remain in place and not move arbitrarily. The naval landing forces on North Sichuan Road must not enter the Chinese界以免 to avoid misunderstandings. In addition, special attention should be paid to the actions of Japanese浪人, and important members of the Japanese community in Shanghai should be asked to pay attention to them.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Zhejiang Shipping Merchants Oppose Collecting Additional Donations <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>A Meeting will be Held Tomorrow at the Shanghai Shipping Association to Decide</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs plans to collect additional donations on cargo and passengers from shipping vessels throughout the province in order to revitalize donations, which has aroused opposition from shipping merchants throughout the province. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e289">Donation Collection Period <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, based on the request of the Department of Civil Affairs,</p>
<p>levies additional donations on cargo and passengers transported and sold by shipping vessels throughout the province, which is used for disaster relief. The amount of the donation is stipulated to be one-tenth of the freight and passenger ticket prices charged by each shipping vessel, with a fixed period of six months, which will be abolished after the period expires. This intention has been notified to the shipping bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Shipping Merchants Oppose <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>After the promulgation of this circular,</p>
<p>the Zhejiang shipping industry throughout the province has repeatedly convened meetings before the 11th of this month. Everyone agrees that all industries are sluggish, and shipping is even more depressed. If additional donations are levied, customers will be driven to switch to highways, and shipping merchants will have no hope of doing business. Therefore, they unanimously opposed it. At that time, the Zhejiang government announced a postponement of the collection period and tried to persuade the shipping merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Convening a Meeting <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>There are also many ships sailing along the Zhejiang coast in Shanghai.</p>
<p>If the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Taizhou, Zhoushan, Chuanshan, etc., all have a direct relationship with the additional donation. This morning, the Shanghai Shipping Association has notified China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, Ping'an, Yili, Daxing, Chuanshan, and other shipping companies to send fully authorized representatives to the Shipping Association at noon tomorrow to hold a meeting for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Yang Debao Specially Sells Military Supplies <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>Arrested at the Nanjing Hotel</p>
<p>Handed over to the Public Security Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, Chao Shou, a policeman stationed at the North Railway Station by the Fifth District Police Station in Zhabei, was searching a suspected person named Di Wanxing (from Jiangpu). He seized 200 bullets from his side and immediately took him to the police station. Under interrogation, he confessed that the bullets were purchased from Yang Debao (also known as A Bao or Lao Wu), who specializes in selling military supplies, for 38 yuan. Yang lived in room 407 of the Nanjing Hotel. Director Jin immediately ordered detectives to go to the address with the detectives of the General Inspectorate and arrest Yang, and handed him over to the First Special Court for trial and detention. This morning, Judge Feng of the Special Court continued the trial. Zhan Jifeng, a legal counsel specially assigned by the Public Security Bureau, appeared in court and stated that the incident occurred in the Chinese concession and requested that Yang Debao be allowed to be transferred back to the Public Security Bureau for trial. The lawyer of the Inspectorate, Ru Baoyi, expressed his agreement. Judge Feng ordered that Yang Debao be allowed to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for trial.</p>

<p>Claiming to be a Prostitute, with Many Valuables Gifted by Customers</p>
<p>Although in Contact with a Mr. Jin, She Didn't Know He was a Kidnapper</p>
<p>Zhou Guisen, a Chinese detective, and Luo Si, a Western detective, of the Old Zhabei Inspectorate, cracked a kidnapping gang consisting of Chen Zhaoqi (also known as Ni Si), Yuan Guangyao, Yuan Dianlai, Ma Zhengcai, Lu Zanggong, a woman Jin Wangshi (the wife of the fugitive leader Jin Wenliang, also known as Feng Lanxiang), Chen Sanfeng, Chen Taoshi, Yuan Wangshi, and nine hundred other people in the British and French concessions on December 1 last year. They seized a Mauser pistol, 1,369 bullets, 1,342.5 yuan in cash, as well as gold rings, gold watches, gold bracelets, bank passbooks, and other items, and sent them to the First Special District Court. Chen and others were interrogated and confessed that they had not committed any crimes in the concession, but had committed a major kidnapping and ransom case in Shaoxing Yuyao. Chen Zhaoqi and others were ordered to be transferred to the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team for trial, and the guns and ammunition were handed over. The women, Jin Wangshi and others, were released immediately due to lack of evidence. However, Jin Tushi claimed that she was mistakenly detained at the time, and that she was not Jin Wangshi, but Feng Lanxiang. In addition to having her gold ornaments and cash confiscated when she was arrested, she was also beaten by detectives and was unwilling to accept it. Therefore, she hired lawyers Lu Qi and Da Yaoxian to file a lawsuit against detective Zhou Guisen for assault, requesting that he be punished according to law and that the confiscated items be returned. The Special Court has completed the trial, and Zhou was fined. However, Zhou did not accept the verdict and is now appealing to the Second Branch of the High Court. The reasons for his appeal are that he was not present when Feng Lanxiang was arrested, how could he have beaten her? Please clear his name. The High Branch accepted the case and it is heard that the trial will be opened soon. However, Feng Lanxiang believed that the court had not ruled on the part of the return of property, so she still entrusted lawyer Lu Qi to file a petition for supplementary judgment. This morning, Judge Wu Tingrui summoned Feng Lanxiang to court and explained to Feng that the property confiscated from her was not due to the assault case, but was confiscated in another case, so not only could it not be returned, but it had to be transferred to the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team. Now her request for supplementary judgment is considered unreasonable and is rejected. Judge Wu also informed that he had just received an official letter from the Security Team, with a confession from the bandit Chen Zhaoqi attached, [which roughly stated that Jin Wangshi, that is, Feng Lanxiang, was indeed] the wife of the fugitive kidnapper Jin Wenliang. Chen was sick last year and had been recuperating at Jin Wangshi's home for half a month. Therefore, they requested that Jin Wangshi be detained so that they could send someone to receive her. He then questioned Feng, and Feng denied it outright and claimed that she was a prostitute who solicited customers in Shanghai, and that all the valuables were gifts from customers, which she had saved up over time. However, she did have contact with a Mr. Jin at the time, but she did not know that he was a kidnapper. Judge Wu examined the confession and ordered Feng Lanxiang to be sent to the Women's Prison for detention, pending the conclusion of the assault appeal case by detective Zhou before further verification.</p>

<p>Japan Implements</p>
<p>Industrial Immigration Plan</p>
<p>The Second Step in Annexing Manchurian Enterprises</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that since the implementation of agricultural self-defense immigration groups, various important undertakings have gradually shown signs of prosperity due to the concrete development of Manchurian-Mongolian economy. Now, they are further implementing the second step of the immigration policy, which is to establish an industrial immigration group plan. Currently, the Kwantung Army Special Service Department and the South Manchuria Railway Economic Investigation Committee have conducted a detailed investigation into the industrial aspects, and the specific proposal has been agreed upon as follows: (1) In Manchurian enterprises with a monopolistic nature, those that usually employ more than 100 office workers and employees should have half of their employees be Japanese. (2) Starting from this year, with three years as a period, 10,000 industrial immigrants (including families) (approximately 30,000 to 50,000 people) will be transferred to Manchuria and distributed to existing, unestablished, and newly established enterprise organizations. (3) The necessary travel expenses for this immigration will be entirely borne by the entrepreneurs. (4) The Japanese government will bear a portion of the various facilities necessary for the immigration group, such as education, hygiene, and security. In this way, not only can the surplus labor force in Japan be distributed, but also the industries of the entire Manchuria can be developed.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Saving the Country Requires Real Strength <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Since the earth-shattering September 18th Incident, all kinds of patriotic movements by the people of the country, such as meetings, parades, speeches, petitions, boycotts, organizing volunteer forces, and sending telegrams to the League of Nations as diplomatic backing, have been fully implemented and can be declared blameless to Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>But I want to ask: God, has the country actually been saved? The land of thousands of square miles in the Northeast, and the more than thirty million compatriots, are still under the trampling iron hooves of Japanese imperialism! Recently, it was reported that the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen has passed the entire draft of the report. Japan has decided to formally withdraw from the League of Nations on the 25th of this month and is prepared to issue a final ultimatum, mobilize all forces to attack Jehol, and disrupt our country's interior. The facts are pressing. Can we still deceive ourselves?</p>
<p>Then how exactly can we save the country? At this final moment of life and death, everyone must unite, take courage, and truly muster the strength to fight back and recover lost territory. Even if only a drop of blood or a breath of air remains in the end, we must fiercely spray it towards the enemy!</p>
<p>[Strength] is nothing more than manpower, financial resources, and material resources: those who can exhaust manpower must resolutely go to the front line, with the determination to "break the cauldrons and sink the boats," and achieve the practical effect of "killing the enemy and achieving results." As for the general armed comrades who are supported by the people's blood and sweat and the country's financial resources, they should especially hold the ambition of "achieving benevolence and taking righteousness," and make their guns point outward to fight the enemy for the final victory, which goes without saying. Others who cannot serve on the battlefield must have a thorough understanding of the idea that "if the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to?" Seize the opportunity to contribute as much as possible their wealth and strength, destroy their homes to relieve the country's difficulties, and after exhausting their own strength, also find ways to exhaust manpower, and also broadly emulate the socialite Ms. Chen Ruiyun's ability to cleverly use her beautiful appearance to raise huge sums of money and continuously send them to the soldiers at the front!</p>
<p>Alas! The hand of Japanese imperialism that is slowly torturing our country is now proudly holding up the sharp blade, ready to sever our throats! If the people of the country do not exert all their strength to struggle for their lives, but still regard themselves as fish and meat on the chopping board, feeling secure, then such a numb and unfeeling country and people will inevitably face the tragedy of national destruction, and there is really no justice in heaven, what else can be said!</p>
<h3 id="e296">You Tiao (Fried Dough Sticks) <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— A Tang</p>
<p>Today, after reading Mr. Yiran's article "[Sweet Fermented Rice]" in this publication, I immediately thought of "[You Tiao]."</p>
<p>The manufacturing methods of things like "[Sweet Fermented Rice]" and "[You Tiao]" were, of course, secretly groped out by predecessors and are definitely not based on any scientific knowledge. However, we can now discover that the manufacturing of these things demonstrates very interesting chemical principles, which shows the importance of the relationship between chemistry and daily life.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the manufacturing method of you tiao and the chemical principles involved.</p>
<p>First, prepare a bowl of cold clear water, about 400 cubic centimeters. Dissolve 5 qian of fine alum powder in the water, then add 3 qian of baking soda and 2.5 qian of table salt. Stir with a stick until completely dissolved. At this time, many bubbles will form in the bowl. Blow away the bubbles, and the water in the bowl will turn milky white. This water is what makes the you tiao expand and become hollow. Now, let's write the chemical reaction equations below:</p>
<p>(1) The chemical reaction of alum and water:</p>
<p>２Ａ１Ｋ（ＳＯ４＋Ｈ２Ｏ２Ａ１ＯＨ）３Ｋ</p>
<p>２ＳＯ４３Ｈ２ＳＯ４</p>
<p>Alum Water Light Aluminum Hydroxide Potassium Sulfate Sulfuric Acid</p>
<p>(2) After adding baking soda, it reacts with sulfuric acid. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>３Ｈ２ＳＯ４ＳＨＮSHNaCO3　3NA2SO46</p>
<p>H2O　6CO2</p>
<p>Sulfuric Acid Baking Soda Sodium Sulfate Water Carbon Dioxide Now we need to do the second step: mix this water with 4 liang of fine wheat flour and continuously knead it into a paste with your hands. When you pick it up with both hands, the wheat flour paste should be able to leak through your fingers. Then, transfer it to a board, stretch it into a strip shape, about 7 centimeters wide, then use a knife to cut it into small strips. Stack two small strips together, gently press them with a bamboo tube, then stretch them out and twist them into a spiral strip. Place them in a hot oil pan, and wait for them to expand and turn golden brown, then the you tiao is done.</p>
<p>When the you tiao is placed in the oil for frying, the carbon dioxide gas contained in the batter is subjected to intense heat, and its volume expands. At this time, the small powder on the outside of the you tiao turns into dextrin and combines with the gluten, preventing the carbon dioxide gas inside from leaking out. Therefore, the you tiao expands under the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas.</p>
<p>As for the light aluminum hydroxide, potassium sulfate, and sodium sulfate, these things all remain in the you tiao, but these are all non-toxic. You can eat you tiao with peace of mind.</p>

<p>— He Shouren</p>
<p>I once heard of naval vessels stationed in Bohai (During the Qing Dynasty, Daoguang and Xianfeng eras)</p>
<p>During the years when the Anglo-French allied forces attacked Tianjin and Dagukou (There were troops stationed in Lushun and Dalian), it was a time when the Central Plains was filled with the sound of drums and war cries (It was the time of the Taiping Rebellion). They dared to boast that the nine border garrisons had fierce warriors (Since the Republic of China, the three northeastern provinces have increased their military strength year by year to two or three hundred thousand soldiers). Who knew that a sudden whale roar would occur (The September 18th Incident). Burning oneself has a reason because of one's teeth, Indulging the enemy, one regrets biting the navel for no reason. Ashamed of becoming a puppet monkey, Pitifully, the borders are touched like sheep and goats,</p>
<p>The Xiongnu often wanted to peek at the grazing horses, The Northern Expedition's carriages and horses left the border. The painted horn sounded, and the star banner moved in the wind, The snow pressed down on the yak tail standard, and the feathered urgent dispatch sped away. Fortunately, the Treaty of Nerchinsk was successfully concluded, Spreading out the map, I feel the boundary marker has been moved, Even the full flourish of the past was like this, Today's perilous situation is easily known, The Longsha road is long and far, For ten years, I have followed the army and the captive's spirit has disappeared, People think of Ban Chao for expanding the territory, Who can be entrusted with planning the border like Huo Qubing, Everyone passed on that the Flying General could subdue tigers, I don't believe that barbarian chieftains dare to shoot eagles, How can I bear to let the rocky border be ruined and embroidered, Do not say that the strong enemy is the favored one of heaven,</p>
<h3 id="e298">War Front Letters <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Huan</p>
<p>Goodbye, a temporary goodbye from the last bitter kiss! It's pitiful to say, growing up in a metropolis, I have never been a sojourner in a foreign land; this time, for the sake of the country's survival and the nation's life, I have come to this bitterly cold northern land for the first time. When I was little, I often heard my father say: how cold the north is, how difficult it is, now I have finally experienced everything firsthand. Since last winter, it has been snowing heavily every day, and the mountains, fields, and villages are all immersed in a silver world. The cold weather is often more than ten degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and frostbite is common. Many brothers have been taken away by death due to their inability to adapt to the climate. "[How many people have returned from ancient battles]," it is indeed meaningful. However, we have now completely forgotten our own survival, our own physical bodies, and have long dedicated them to the god of life. Death seems to have nothing to do with us. We are constantly preparing for death, death, death, sacrificing death for the liberation of the entire Chinese nation is glorious and great.</p>
<p>Now our military supplies have been replenished, and we have arrived at a certain place on the front line from the rear defense. In recent days, the entire front line has been unusually silent, with only small contacts between the sentries of the two sides, and enemy iron birds constantly coming and going in the sky above us for reconnaissance. Other than that, there is nothing happening, it is simply hard for us to believe that this is a battlefield. Everyone in the deep trenches is very happy every day, there is talking, there is laughter, and the ringing radio also sends out pleasant songs from time to time, like a prelude to the war, celebrating our victory. Bang bang bang… Puff puff puff… The enemy has launched a general attack. A burst of battle cries, a burst of gunfire, followed by a burst of hand-to-hand combat. God, please give us this time! We are waiting with full willingness.</p>
<p>X, my best person, the person I love the most, please rest assured! Those who are destined to die will definitely not die. Those who live in a drunken dream, not resisting, may not be visited by death. China is now in danger of death at any time and anywhere, natural disasters can kill, the Communists can kill, warlord infighting can kill, imperialist aggression can kill, nowhere are we not in the teasing of death. Instead of watching the country change color and the volunteer army being defeated one by one, it is better to come to the front line happily and fight the enemy to the death with our flesh and blood. Our heads are worth an enemy bullet. You must do your best to maintain the affairs of the family! Our time together was really too short. A big gap will inevitably form in each other's hearts. However, we who have dedicated ourselves to the liberation of the country and the nation can only take the love of the entire country and the entire nation as our object, and fight and sacrifice. Our souls have deeply merged into the great soul of the entire nation. We are now striving for a life of love for the entire nation, and we are willing to charge into battle with the spirit of praying for death. X, please bless us! The war situation is critical, so I will stop writing here. Wishing you health! Your X at the very front line of Jehol</p>
<h3 id="e299">Our Way Out <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Er</p>
<p>At a time when all industries are depressed, the economy is in panic, strong neighbors are pressing, and people's hearts are treacherous, we [young people] constantly feel the difficulty of finding a "[way out]." It's like Wu Zixu losing his way in the mountains when he hadn't passed Zhaoguan. But at that time, there were still people who could clearly point out his way out. But what about us? No matter how we shout and cry, who will pay attention to us? From this point of view, our situation is indeed much more difficult than Wu Zixu's! In other words, our situation is like "[running a horse on the bow of a boat, there is] no way out!"</p>
<p>Indeed, many young people feel pain and disappointment because of job or economic problems. Some feel pessimistic because of the approaching foreign invasion and the difficulty of the country's future. Some, although they have jobs, feel that their positions cannot be permanent, and therefore feel depressed. Some, although they have jobs, are oppressed by the "[Fifth Class]," and therefore feel resentment. Finally, and most commonly, they fall into decadence because of broken love.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned kinds are, of course, the depression of the average young person [excluding a few]. Even the author himself has experienced many of the various joys and sorrows, and has spent a lot of time objectively considering what he has encountered from beginning to end. The final result [— no, it is also our lesson —] tells me: apart from striving to work hard to change my own situation, there is really no second "[way out]!"</p>
<p>Let me give an example. For example, if my lover leaves me, of course I will feel frustrated at first, but my conclusion is: I should work hard to increase my knowledge, and work even harder to forge my physique, and find a partner who suits me better in the future! Sometimes, when I encounter the situation of being oppressed by the "[Fifth Class]," of course I will feel angry at first, but the conclusion is: work hard! Study hard! When my talent and intelligence reach a considerable level and I can find a considerable position, I will leave without regard for anything!</p>
<p>In short, in the course of our lives, every disappointment, frustration, and indignation is an opportunity for us to strive for progress! Perhaps some people think this is completely idealistic. In fact, no! Because the author himself, after coming out of the third grade of elementary school, encountered the above-mentioned misfortunes, and every time he didn't use this to stimulate his ambition, and every time he was not successful. After leaving the third grade of elementary school, I entered the business world, from an apprentice in the accounting room, to a telephone operator, to a junior high school teacher, to a senior high school teacher. In recent years, I have been working as a translator in an international organization.</p>
<p>Finally, I must also declare that in the course of my progress, I have not received the pity of philanthropists, the help of big figures, the comfort of lovers, or the promotion of relatives. In other words, it is entirely based on my own efforts and struggles to achieve my ideal goal! "[Effort]" and "[struggle]" are, of course, my only way out. If readers have other "[ways out]," we very much hope that they will be put forward. On the one hand, it can complete the intention of this humble work of throwing a brick to attract jade, and on the other hand, it can also point out the way for many young people who are trapped in depression!</p>
<h3 id="e300">The Origin of Rumors <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Every teacher in the school has a nickname, as common as writing "Do not urinate outside the urinal" in the toilet. The English teacher, Dr. Zhu, was introduced by the principal as having just returned from the United States. He also has a handsome face and has changed six suits in just one week since coming to the school. (Note: Sunday is a holiday.)</p>
<p>"[Gigolo]" is inextricably linked to the three words Dr. Zhu.</p>
<p>One day.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhu was writing American-style English on the blackboard behind the students' backs. I don't know if he wanted to show off his English scholarship, but he wrote a little too fast? The powder ash on the blackboard blew into the doctor's eyes. He was afraid that the students would unleash their college temperament and have a burst of laughter, so he hurriedly reached into his suit pocket to touch his imported silk handkerchief. As the saying goes, there is no coincidence without a book. He touched several pockets in a row, but they were all empty. The doctor squinted one eye, that embarrassed state, the white face also reflected a blush. What was even more coincidental was that Queen Lu noticed his attitude in particular, and she couldn't help but smile slightly knowingly. Dr. Zhu, in order to force himself to calm down, also reluctantly smiled slightly, thinking he was concealing it. After class.</p>
<p>"[The Queen and the Gigolo are flirting with each other!]"</p>
<p>"[Go look in the mirror!]"</p>
<p>One day.</p>
<p>It was already 5:00 p.m. Queen Lu and her cousin were walking in the campus. Many big-footed pants who thought they were qualified to be emperors also leisurely walked in the campus on the surface. The Queen's eyes were quick, and she suddenly saw Dr. Zhu coming out of the principal's office. That hurried posture reminded Miss Lu of the embarrassing scene of the powder ash flying into his eyes. She secretly told her cousin, and pointed to Dr. Zhu who was approaching. Probably all women are good at laughing, and the cousin actually chuckled. So our Queen couldn't help but smile slightly. Dr. Zhu happened to have walked in front of them, and he also inexplicably smiled slightly, and had to smile.</p>
<p>At dinner time.</p>
<p>"[There is a good reason for the Queen and the Gigolo!]"</p>
<p>"[You are heartbroken!]"</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>Miss Lu and her banker father brought a 1933 Citroen to see the grand hotel at Yuantai. As the car was about to drive to the front of the theater, our Queen saw Dr. Zhu waiting for someone at the door again, and that facial expression had to remind Miss Lu of the embarrassing scene of the powder ash flying into his eyes. As the car stopped in front of the door, the father and daughter had just stepped out of the car, when Dr. Zhu suddenly went nearby to buy a box of musk, and ran into Miss Lu face to face. This time, the two smiled slightly at the same time, and the big gift was added with a slight nod.</p>

<p>— Cheng Sen</p>
<p>Should young students smoke?</p>
<p>Here, the smoke I am talking about is of course not "[opium]," but "[cigarettes]."</p>
<p>In today's society, smoking is a very common and popular thing. Even young people who are still underage in their intellectual era regard smoking as enjoyable and relieving fatigue. Yes, cigarettes can relieve people's boredom and fatigue, but they are harmful and useless to underage young people, because the quality of the smoke contains nicotine toxins and can reduce memory. Therefore, various countries have regulations prohibiting minors from smoking. In our country's schools, banning smoking is of course very strict, but they knowingly violate it and do not regard smoking as harmful. This matter of underage smoking, although very small, but if we thoroughly consider it, its drawbacks have the following three kinds:</p>
<p>(1) Harmful to the body</p>
<p>(2) Waste of money</p>
<p>(3) Money outflow (except for those who smoke domestic goods)</p>
<p>Judging from the above three items, its consumption is also considerable. And the benefits of smoking are very small (it can be said that there are none). Not smoking is not harmful to us. At this time of national crisis, we should save money to deal with foreign enemies. Young people should not smoke, and even people who stand in society, within a certain range, turn this consumed money into something useful and donate to the volunteer army. I think if the whole country implements this together, its amount will be astonishing.</p>

<p>— Written by Ed Falkowski, Translated by Sui</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Evening, the evening city is hazy, like an old man smoking in his sleep, purple shadows tightly reflecting the chestnut and elm trees of October, the western sunlight gradually sinking,</p>
<p>Along Qiaoding, Wu Ke, Huixi, and other streets, yellow lights shimmered in the great and beautiful houses. The lights shone on the pianos, candlesticks, and plates in the porcelain cabinets. The aroma of dinner wafted over. The civilized families in the city were gathered together for dinner, the sounds of knives and forks clashing, cups and basins passing, and the laughter and indistinct talk of irrelevant things that happened during the day.</p>
<p>The black shadow of the cold dusk only fell in the poor lanes. A kerosene lamp was placed on a table covered with oilcloth, and the smoke from the lampshade rose to the ceiling. Behind the stove hung the clothes worn in the mine, waiting to dry. The shaking of the hanging clothes filled the room with a terrible sight. These clothes were to be worn every day for work. Mud-covered boots trampled in the congealing pit mud. The feet wearing the boots walked on the muddy sleepers, all the way to the tunnel.</p>
<p>A rough-faced woman was cutting bread, smearing it with lard, and then adding a slice of bacon. She put the bread in a round tin can and covered it. The buzzing sound in the pot echoed. Familiar fingers opened the lid, and a cloud of water vapor as large as an umbrella was released. She scooped some coffee into the boiling water. At the same time, she thought of the dirty clothes hanging behind the stove. The moisture had disappeared. Peter could wear them to climb into the mine when the mine whistle blew the next morning.</p>
<p>Peter was sleeping on the bed upstairs, or rather, was fantasizing. Every day, when he came back from work, he would first complain bitterly. Life, he said painfully, was not the life of his youth. The pit was like hell. Every day he only felt tired, poor and lowly.</p>
<p>A suitable amount of cold water had been prepared in the bathtub, with some hot water added. Peter took off his sweat-soaked underwear. He rubbed his chest with coarse soap with both hands, and then asked Mary to rub his back for him. He rubbed his whole body with soap again, and then dug out the dirt from around his ears, nose, and lips.</p>
<p>The pot on the stove was playing a faint tune. In this pot, Mary arranged the day's housework — dinner. After the cabbage soup was followed by shredded meat and large bones. From this large bone, Peter sucked the marrow with all his might. He forcefully knocked the bone against the edge of the table, so that the treasured bone marrow inside would loosen.</p>
<p>The food after the meal was only a puff of crude smoke. Outside, only the black shadows of the houses were reflected on the street, and the black shadows of the electric poles crisscrossed in the road.</p>
<p>Peter yawned, knocked the pipe against the door of the stove, and said: [I'm going to take a nap, Mary.]</p>
<p>Every bone is aching. Wake me up in two hours. I'm really tired!] This was a daily occurrence</p>

<h3 id="e303">Looking Back on Those Years by Charles Farrell <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Qin</p>
<p>Eight years ago, I went to Hollywood to visit a friend of my father. My father's friend worked in the theater. When I arrived in Hollywood, he introduced me to King Vidor, who gave me a small, unnamed role. After a year and a half, I gradually rose in prominence. My first leading role was opposite Madge Bellamy in "The Air Mail."</p>
<p>At that time, I hadn't joined Fox yet. I had a friend who was an actor at Fox. He encouraged me to join Fox. One day, I was wearing a newsboy cap when Murray dragged me into Frank Borzage's office. Murray spoke eloquently to Borzage on my behalf, but Borzage seemed not to hear, only looking at me. Later, he asked me many questions as if examining me and then offered me a contract.</p>
<p>I will never forget the day Borzage put my name, Charles Farrell, below Chico's name on the cast list for "Seventh Heaven." My fate with Janet Gaynor can also be said to have begun on that day. After "Seventh Heaven," Janet and I starred in eleven films together. I know that some of them were failures. The ones I was most satisfied with were "Seventh Heaven," "Street Angel," "The First Year," "High Society Blues," and my farewell film with Janet, "Merely Mary Ann."</p>
<p>At Fox, I co-starred with Joan Bennett, Maureen O'Sullivan, Elissa Landi, and Janet Gaynor, among others. But as I leave Fox this time, I feel the most reluctant to part with Janet Gaynor. Saying goodbye to the others was just like parting with ordinary friends.</p>
<p>Leaving Fox feels like leaving a loving mother. I have many brothers and sisters there who are still very happy together, but I can no longer live that life with them.</p>
<p>On the day I said goodbye to Janet, after we each said "take care," I felt a pang of bitterness and almost shed tears. It's a pity the photographer wasn't there, otherwise, he would have captured it on camera. Indeed, Janet and I have filmed countless scenes together, but that scene would have been the most genuine and memorable.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e304">Spring Waves and Amorous Shadows in Early Spring <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Recently, films from Germany and Russia have given us excellent impressions, causing American film merchants to panic. What we have seen can be roughly divided into two types. The first is socially descriptive films that are highly meaningful, such as "Westfront 1918" and "People on Sunday." The second is musical and dance films, such as "The Congress Dances" (everyone and every newspaper thought this was a British film, but it was actually German). The first type is beyond the reach of American films. The second type can also compete with American films. This time, the Xin Guang film "Monte Carlo Madness" belongs to this type of English musical.</p>
<p>Its plot is somewhat similar to several amorous histories produced by Hollywood. A queen, dissatisfied with the navy's lack of funds, learns that the captain is in Monte Carlo and follows him there. Unexpectedly, upon seeing him, she suddenly falls in love and dances with him. The captain doesn't know she's the queen. Later, the captain loses a huge sum of money and, feeling aggrieved, forces the casino to return the full amount, threatening to bombard the coast otherwise. The queen doesn't take it seriously and dismisses the captain in front of all the sailors. In shame and anger, he eventually retrieves the money to pay the sailors. He then takes another ship, intending to go to Shantou. The queen, heartbroken, chases after him by ship. The vast ocean becomes the backdrop for her pursuit, forming the ending of the film.</p>
<p>There is nothing particularly meaningful to be found in this play, it is simply saying that "love" is the most powerful thing in the world.</p>
<p>The director is very clever, adopting highly meaningful backgrounds to create a complete film. The beginnings and endings are all very quiet, leaving people with lingering feelings to explore. The visual effects are excellent, and the interior scenes are also good. The photography is continental in style, and the lighting is very appropriate. The side shots are interspersed, moving and thought-provoking. In fashionable terms, it has humor amidst the prosperity.</p>
<p>The actors are all unfamiliar faces to us, but the unknown often hides true heroes. Sari Maritza, who plays the queen, has surpassing grace. In terms of acting, she surpasses MacDonald. She is both noble and innocent. Hans Albers, who plays the captain, has a healthy physique that is admirable. He also has good expressions. The other supporting actors are all very good. It is a pity that there is too little singing. Sari didn't sing a single song, which is a waste of excellent music. Since it focuses on Monte Carlo, it's nothing more than the following four things: dance halls, casinos, money, and women! The extravagance and indulgence can indeed be considered the extreme of auditory and visual entertainment, but it also carries a hint of contempt for women and treating them as playthings. One flaw in the set design is that the queen's palace is too simple.</p>
<p>This is a purely artistic success. It evokes various complex emotions such as joy, humor, and satisfaction! Those who like to watch movies may want to see it once. It has some different and interesting flavors compared to American musicals.</p>

<p>— Shen</p>
<p>"Girl Crazy" is basically a farcical musical, devoid of plot or meaning. It is simply a very beautiful and lively work within the framework of entertainment.</p>
<p>What is most commendable, of course, is the gathering of so many comedic characters in one work. The masterminds behind the farce are Wheeler and Woolsey. One plays a [missing text], and the other plays a lecherous womanizer. The mastermind behind the romance is Eddie Quillan, who transforms a wild western ranch into a decadent entertainment venue. The female group includes Dorothy Lee and the newly famous beauty Arline Judge. Of course, Wheeler and Woolsey's antics are the essence of the entire film. Their ingenious plans to avoid being hanged by the barbaric ranchers, as well as scenes of them disguising as Indian natives, are truly hilarious. Little star Mitzi Green's imitations of the gossiping Edna May Oliver, George Arliss, and six or seven other famous stars are also highly commendable.</p>
<p>The film features very melodic music and eight songs by George Gershwin, which are very pleasing to the ear. However, the "dance" is not as described in the advertisements, with only a few scenes.</p>
<h3 id="e306">Review of "Divorce in the Family" <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>"Divorce in the Family"</p>
<p>This film raises a serious question before us, and one that is not easily resolved at present. That's what I felt when I left the theater.</p>
<p>The film tells the story of an archaeologist who is loyal to his career. In order to travel the world and increase his knowledge, he has to travel all year round and abandon his wife. Later, the wife, feeling lonely, falls in love with a doctor and wants to marry him. However, her child will inevitably be taken to live with her new husband. Although the new husband is kind and happy to accept the child, the child does not want to lose the love of his biological father and live with a stranger. In the end, the child is taken care of by his stepfather in a situation that cannot be resolved. Regarding this, we have received much practical evidence from the minds of many children who marry with their mothers or are abused by their stepmothers. Although the play raises these questions, it does not reach a conclusion. However, perhaps this problem cannot be solved by realistic society? Unless the economic foundation has undergone a thorough transformation.</p>
<p>Precisely because it captures this complex subject matter, precisely because the actions of the characters in the play cannot be criticized or cursed (of course, this refers to those who are not wearing bifocals), the director of this play has indeed undertaken an extraordinary and very strenuous task. Of course, he must focus on the depiction of the child, but he cannot slack off on the other characters. In that case, the director of this film is very successful in these aspects, but it cannot be said to be perfect. At least his depiction of the father is still not sufficient.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the several important actors in this play are very strenuous. In particular, that child, truly, only Jackie Cooper can do it. We are indeed worthy of respect for this outstanding little star. Louis Stone, who plays the father, has demonstrated his skills in many situations. He is even more suitable for the role in this film. As for Conrad Nagel, who plays the mother, although he is not unsuccessful, he is still inferior to the two above.</p>
<p>As for the other sets, lighting, sound, etc., they did not disappoint us, but there were no particularly amazing techniques either.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a rare film from MGM. In terms of its subject matter, it is very worthy of our attention.</p>

<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>For nearly two years, Bebe Daniels has been relentlessly harassed by a crazed veteran named Albert Holland. He claims that Bebe is his former wife and insists that she return to the four sons she abandoned years ago.</p>
<p>His absurd claim that Bebe married him early on is known to everyone. Two years ago, Bebe received many love letters, but she did not pay attention to them because every famous star in Hollywood often encounters such things. So Holland stayed up all night at her house. Almost every night he waited in the courtyard of her Santa Monica seaside villa, waiting for an opportunity to renew his request. He knows everything about Bebe's movements. Even when Bebe goes to other cities, he knows, although Bebe's actions are very secretive, and no one knows except her family, but Holland always follows.</p>
<p>Later, Holland was arrested, and he accepted Bebe's advice and agreed to leave Hollywood, but he soon returned. Bebe's husband, Ben Lyon, listened to his friend's advice and sent him to a nursing home, but he escaped not long after.</p>
<p>In December 1931, Bebe and Ben petitioned the court to try Holland to prove his insanity. During the interrogation, the veteran looked very pitiful, so the merciful judge sentenced him to life in the Agnew State Hospital. But recently he came to Hollywood again, no one knows how he escaped. He once wrote to Bebe, mentioning his persecution, fearing that his wounded heart would make him take revenge. Therefore, there are bodyguards at the house in Santa Monica, and the police are strictly tracking Holland's whereabouts. Bebe and Ben agree that Holland's actions are controlled by abnormal psychology and are not deeply blameworthy, but they deeply hope that he will be arrested and that he will not be able to come out again, that this time is the last time.</p>

<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>Not long after, a young woman ran to Roosevelt Hospital. She said to the nurse, "I want to see two people, one is Jimmy Morgan, and the other is Miss Millie Bloom. They were injured in the explosion on Forty-Seventh Street."</p>
<p>The nurse was very calm and slowly recited, "Morgan, Jimmy."</p>
<p>Her eyes looked towards one end of the large room. The young woman followed her eyes and saw Jimmy sitting on a bench. She rushed over immediately. Jimmy had also seen her and shouted, "Punchy! I thought you were in that house! I wanted to save you."</p>
<p>Punchy cried so much that her face was covered in tears, and she sobbed, "I was at Grand Central Station, sitting there waiting for the train. I was planning to go home." Later, I bought an extra edition, which was written in detail, knowing that Mona had been rescued, Millie caused the disaster by committing suicide, and you were also injured. How badly are you hurt?"</p>
<p>"Not badly," Jimmy said. "I'm fine, but Millie is dying."</p>
<p>Jimmy stood up and went with Punchy to see Millie. Millie had already been calling their names, wanting to see them. Millie was wrapped in white bandages all over, with only her eyes exposed from head to toe. Her lips were cracked, and it was extremely difficult to speak. She first asked, "Did you see the letter I left?"</p>
<p>After a while, she said again, "My letter was pinched in my hand, and then I opened the gas pipe. I wanted to end it all. Punchy,"</p>
<p>"Do you know what I told Jimmy? I have no other way to go but death."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you told Jimmy," Punchy said sadly. "I don't want to know either."</p>
<p>"But I must let you know. I love Jimmy. I heard that you were going to marry Jimmy, and my heart was broken. I felt</p>
<p>as if I was going crazy, so I told Jimmy many lies. But what I said was false. Later, I regretted it and went to talk to Jimmy, but Jimmy wouldn't listen to me. So I wrote him a letter and decided to commit suicide myself to clarify what is right and wrong."</p>
