<p>東京覆文堅持拒絕美俄參加</p>
<p>日代表分頭活動求大國諒解</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九委員會今日下午仍舉行非公開會議、激烈辯論三小時後、决定電詢日政府對於决議草案是否除邀請美俄參加一點外、其餘均可接受、並請於星期五以前明白答復、（十九晨二時三十七分中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本關於十九特委會之覆文、今日送出、覆文拒絕承認［滿洲國］之討論、並拒絕非會員國之加入調解、衆信十九特委會將抛棄調解、至是國聨大會必須草擬一種報告、衆料此種報告將贊成李頓報告書、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日下午四時十九國委員會開會時、諒將承認其努力尋覔中日妥協基礎已告失敗、蓋料委員會將拒絕日本之提議、故必須按照盟約第十五欵第四節繕製陳述全部爭執事實與供給建議之報告書、惟其進行方法、顯似尙未决定、照目前情形約有三途、㈠十九國委員會或能舉行公開會議、正式發表原擬之决議案草案全文、然後聽任中日代表當衆發表意見、㈡十九國委員會或將不日再開會議、俾中日代表當衆發表意見、然後進行草擬報告書、㈢十九國委員立即進行草擬報告書、因此舉逆料歷時必久、倘若採用第三策、則料國聨秘書廳將發表所謂［德魯蒙方式］者之報告、該報告理由雖極薄弱、但亦撮述國聨在過去十六月中關於中日爭執之活動、并引李頓調查團報告之事實、又聞現有許多小國準備自行草一報告、提出十九國委員會考慮、内將明白斥責日本違犯國聨盟約第十欵、（按盟約第十欵規定、聨合會盟員尊午并保持所有聨合會各盟員領土之完全、及現有政治上之獨立、以防禦外來侵犯之義務、如遇此種侵犯或有任何威嚇或危險之虞時、行政院應籌此項義務之方法、）（十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨對於中日爭案之調解工作、現已達生死關頭、德魯蒙最近與日方之離奇接洽、備受各方責難、法國自德國要求軍備平等後、即决意維持國聨之鞏固、英外相西門之袒日態度、亦不爲其本國輿論所擁護、麥唐納政府且因此而被不良之影響、更以日軍侵入山海關、損及英國在華北之利益、同時美國對國聨之延宕政策、復表示極端不耐、十九委員會當此種情况之下、勢將採取依照盟約第十五條第四項草擬報告之步驟、聞此項報告草案已在商議中、我顧代表曾告新選之國聨秘書長愛文諾、上述報告中務須申明日本違犯國聨盟約、此爲必不可少之條件、郭代表昨晚訪西門、詢英政府所持態度如何云、（十八日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本覆文昨夜非正式送交特委會主席希孟·秘書長德魯蒙·英代表西門·法代表馬錫格里、今晨覆文正文已送達希孟、前德魯蒙與杉村間所議之草方案、除一點外、日本已接受之、惟第一、十九特委會願否贊成此方案、第二、中國願否接受此修改、殊屬可疑、日本所未接受之點、爲邀請非國聨會員國參加事、此事涉及原則與手續問題、原係盟約條文中所應處理之事、今謀解决於國聨之外、此舉是否適當、有敵國對之不無疑問、但此舉乃由英國發起、而國聨大會亦熱切歡迎之、故十九特委會或將不顧日本之反對也至於妥協問題、則星期一日特委會會議時、已討論及之、是以今日或將提出一種方案、因日本對於草議案之修正文、亦猶中國之修正文、現已提交會議也、日本之修正文、德魯蒙將以其所代表者予以有力之援助、但有必不可忽視者、現有一種强烈情感、以爲調解手續失敗無疑、今組織調解委員會、亦不過拖延困苦、再歷數月之久耳、大約抱此種見解之各國、將於今日午後主張一種乾脆的决議、抛棄調解手續、而進行盟約第十五條第四節之規定、果爾、則勢必召集國聨大會、惟在下月初以前、國聨大會未必易於集會也、（十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>分頭積極活動</h3>

<h3>日本又施恫嚇</h3>
<p>採用强制調解</p>
<p>準備退出國聨</p>
<p>法報傳理由書已擬就</p>
<p>（東京）國聨方面盛傳因小國之反對、欲取消特魯蒙與杉村造成之妥協案、日外務省對於國聨此種態度、極爲憤慨、外務省深信今次交涉之結果、必定成立、然國聨如適用第十五項第四項、採取勸告和解之手段、外務省以爲其拘束力頗微弱、且因第四項規定之發動、中日問題實際脱離國聨之手、而國聨與日本之關係亦可清算、外務省已經决意在形勢達到如此狀態之時、實行退出國聨云、（十八日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國報界近日對於國聨處置中日爭端一案、本甚審愼、惟今日各報載日内瓦消息一段稱、一國聨某某數會員國漸已失去其忍耐心、因星期一日之十九國委員會開會之時、英外相西門及法代表馬錫格里二氏均對於日本之延宕政策有所抗議、并據該報告、英外相西門曾恫嚇施用國聨會章第十五條第四節、法代表馬錫格里亦曾聲明國聨已竭其智能、從事於此案之調解、現某國旣有故意損害國聨威信之嫌疑、則此後已無須再繼續努力、］云巴黎晨報之見解、爲此種步驟足以促成日本之退出國聨、該報并謂日本之皇家法律家已將日本退出國聨之聲明書擬就、其退出之理由、［爲日本之鄰國如美如俄皆非國聨會員國、一爲國聨已不能爲和平服務因彼已將遠東事件［世界化］而不加以局部化云、［十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）外間盛傳國聨現在已到不得不採用會章第十五條第四項規定、發動其勸告和解手段之地步、日外務省以此爲國聨不謹愼的對日牽制策、略抱如次意見㈠日政府回訓未交國聨當局以前、宣傳兩者交涉之不可能、實屬國聨之策謀的行爲、㈡日政府旣然在第十五條第三項規定之下擬接收國聨提議、故絕無第三項不成立之理由、㈢邀請美俄問題、三項條件中無此規定、故不應邀請美俄兩國、又毫無停止第三項之發動而採用第四項規定之理由、㈣第四項規定之成立、須要兩當事國以外各國之全體一致然此係極困難之事、雖然見其成立、勸告手段對於日本並無任何强制力、故日本方面絕對不受其作用、（十八日日聨電）</p>

<h3>糾正英墊報誤解</h3>
<p>泰晤士報妄引辛丑條約　　謂榆關事責任不在日本</p>
<h3>我引第九欵切實聲明</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨會中國代表團情報處、本月十六日致函泰晤士報主筆、更正該報對山海關事件之誤解、内稱、貴報最近發表社論、標題爲［滿洲之敵對行動、］其中論點、頗有錯誤、茲特提出聲明、請予注意、貴報社論謂、［山海關敵對行爲之責任、雙方互相推諉、凡遇此等事實、其情形往往如此、第由一九○一年議定書、畀與日本之權利而言、榆城係由天津日軍指揮部所轄區域内之日本軍隊駐守、以故此次事變發生、中國軍隊實有向日軍按照條約駐守之城市移動之嫌、至於日本憲兵部是否有人投擲炸彈一層、所關甚小、不必問也、］如前所云、是貴報所論、係以一九○一年議定書爲根據、查是年繼定書第九欵云、［中國政府由本議定書及附函、承認列强派兵駐守若干地點、以維持首都至海口之交通、其駐兵地點、由列强商定之、其後列强所定駐兵地點、爲黄村·廊坊·楊村·天津·軍糧城·唐沽·蘆台·唐山·　州·昌黎·秦皇島·山海關等處、但須注意者有二點、第一、列强駐兵之山海關一地點、與榆城爲截然兩地、並非同地異名、第二、按照一九○一年議定書、列强所以駐兵之目的、僅在維持首都（北京現改北平）至海口之交通、並非允許列强在各該處有城垣之地設置兵營、屯駐軍隊也、榆關在北平瀋陽（奉天）·鐵路綫以北、列强連日晒在内、其按照一九○一年議定書駐守之地點、則在同一鐵路綫以南、榆城始終爲中國軍隊駐紮之地、貴報所謂通常按照條約、由日軍駐守者誤也、素仰貴報持論公平、特行提出聲明、即希揭載報端爲幸、此函由國聨會中國代表團情報處處長駐　麥公便羅忠詒署名、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日本蠍</p>
<h3>推國聨至水濱</h3>
<p>各國忍與之爲伍乎</p>
<p>孟却斯德報痛斥日本</p>
<p>（倫敦）孟却斯德指導報今日評論滿洲問題、謂歐洲方興的輿情所有鞭策未能成就者、［日本蠍］已在十六個月之後爲國聨成就之矣、國聨特委會已被日本之頑强推至水濱、無論願意與否、國聨至少似須落水云、每日彙報稱、目前問題、爲國聨忍與行動如日本之國者爲伍乎、如其然也、則　聨何爲而存在乎、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>英輿論不一致</h3>
<p>多數人士主對日採堅决行動</p>
<p>中日問題今日提出閣議討論</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國輿論對於中日問題、深覺爲難、而意見亦甚紛岐、目下受事變之影響、此種情形日益加甚、最近國聨秘書長德魯蒙與愛爾蘭代表勒斯特齟齬之後、孟却斯德保衛報對德魯蒙大爲攻擊、輿論紛爭之烈、於此可見、美國之行動畢竟如何、目下尙未明瞭、而英國左派業已藉口美國之行動、要求國聨會採取堅决之行動、以對待日本矣、目眄英國大多數人士、時時表示不宜指逆美國之意思、星期四内閣會議時、西門外相或可參加、屆時此問題之全部、必將提出討論云、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>日本堅持</p>
<h3>結果必蒙不利</h3>
<p>法人之觀察</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國負責方面、今夜對於中日問題之發展、似抱樂觀、以爲協定方案可望獲得、日本堅持不讓、實不利於日本、衆料英法代表西門與瑪錫格里二人所抱之堅决態度、及美國星期日在倫敦與巴黎之表示、可獲結果、此間輿情現集於國内政治與財政問題、故法報對於遠東時局、殊少批評、惟巴黎時報論國聨之地位、謂其處於抽象原則與實在　實之間、一面欲維持盟約之尊嚴、一面欲阻免日本之出會、殊覺爲難云、但該報並未作十九特委會如何可雙方兼顧之建議、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國聨荏弱無能</h3>
<p>德左右派感想不同</p>
<p>一則以喜一則以懼</p>
<p>日本脱退反足鞏固國聨地位</p>
<p>（柏林）遠東爭端、頗爲德國輿論所注意、右派報紙對於十九國委員會之行動、及國聨會所感之困難、頗覺滿意、據右派各報所見、日内瓦爲調解中日爭端而進行之談判、必然失敗、反之左派各報則深爲國聨會之威權　憂、此派以爲國聨會應堅决行動、至日本如退出國聨、則國聨地位反少動搖、蓋國聨由是可不必畏首畏尾、逃避困難也、左派所以爲國聨慮者、心中實有對内政之隠憂在、蓋日本態度、足以證明會員國雖侮辱國聨會無所不至、國聨會亦惟　面自乾、莫可如何、顧國聨會此種懦弱態度、頗爲德國若于人士所竊　、因此　擬　機恢復軍備也、左派人士以此等事、頗足影響内政、不免杞憂云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本對俄不滿</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）被選總統羅斯福今日發表一文、言美國對於遠東時局之態度、一般人皆認此文、表示共和與民主兩黨對於在此問題上之美國政策、已有完全了解、羅斯福聲稱、美國外交政策、必擁護國際條約之尊嚴、其全文曰、任何言論、凡與任何特殊外交形勢有關者、當然必須發自國務卿、但余極願使人明白者、美國外交政策、必須擁護國際條約之尊嚴、此爲國家間各種關係所必依據之基石云、按在此文發表以前、外間即有傳言、謂羅氏贊助現政府關於不承認日本在滿洲以武力取得的土地之政策、報紙爭傳羅氏對於現政府東方政策切實同意之消息、但羅氏對於報紙消息、不願加以批評、紐約持報華盛頓訪電稱、美國現抱不承認［滿洲國］之政策、此外尙無表示云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國新總統羅斯福最近對遠東問題、曾發表簡單而又明切之宣言、此間認羅斯福此舉、意在援助日内瓦美國代表之行動云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據美政界要人言、此間對於日本意欲控制熱河特别區之報、認爲滿洲大問題之一部份、因此美國對於遠東政策、將不再發新宣言、即美國向來究竟認熱河爲中國本部一部份、抑如日政府所稱認爲滿洲一部份、亦不擬有所聲明、甚至遠東專家對此問題、亦不願作答、惟美官場承認若日本軍隊向長城以南行動、則將引起國際新問題、雖萬一日軍有此行動、美政府是否將發新宣言、此時尙無所聞、但美官場此種承認、亦未嘗不可視爲美國行將有所聲明之暗示、今日副國務卿凱塞爾曾與法大使　參贊蒲斯凱會晤、商榷萬一北平區域發生衡突時之保護外僑方法、事後凱氏語人、本日所談完全非正式性質、僅係討論北平方面可供國際行動之方法、惟外國駐兵一時當可致增加、但將照辛丑條約維持北平至海口交通之規定彼此合作而已、照目下此間種種表示、似國務院此時除重行聲明不承認致策外、未必再有所行動、據聞苟非發生新問題、則胡佛總統與國務卿史汀生將俟見國聨及十九國委員會對於滿洲問題之行動後、再有所聲明云、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院宣言、美政府曾於一月七日通令美國駐各國代表謂、美國政策絕未改變、仍依照胡佛主義、對於違反凱洛克非戰條約而造成之局勢、拒絕承認、國務院對於此事、僅對其駐外代表發出通令者、其故有三、㈠不願逕以羅斯福總統名義、發表宣言、㈡不願採取攻擊態度、以增重日本反對美國之心理、㈢美國前曾屢次通牒、迄無效果、故不欲再蹈前轍、致遺譏評、至國務卿史汀生竟以鮮明態度、重申胡佛主義之故、端在平息外間謠言、因有人謂新總統羅斯福與胡佛黨派不同、執政以後、將不繼續前任對於遠東之政策、史汀生以爲當此謠諑紛起之時、如渠默不一言、則世人將妄肆推測、而認爲美國對日本政策日趨軟弱之徵兆、如此則世界輿論所恃以反對日本在華行動之主要抵抗力、將爲之减少矣、國務卿史汀生致駐外各代表之訓令、一經發表、足使新總統羅斯福不復械默、而史汀生本人負責發表之通令、因之倍形有力、一般人以爲羅斯福關於遠東問題、在根本上雖與胡佛政策完全同意、但在實行方法上、或有其個人竟見云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇互不侵犯條約擱淺晦</h3>
<p>（一）日蘇關係之硬化</p>
<p>日蘇之間若即若離。若親近。若非親近。自去年八月。日蘇漁業協定成立。兩國間當前癳腫。似已暫時消去若干。及至松方幸次郎赴蘇而煤油協定實現。日蘇之間更多一重經濟關係如能順序進展。則互不侵犯條約不難成立。日本對外防禦綫即將暫時縮短。單獨張大太平洋防線。一力侵略我國。其實力較爲充足。其勢則更爲完滿也。無如日閥自視過高。必欲展開其［大陸政策。］西侵華北。北噬中東路。所謂日蘇互不侵犯條約者。在日人之意。以爲此乃蘇　之利。至少當有交換條件。論空名則須蘇聨承認［滿洲］（俾儡）國。論實際則須讓流中東路。漁業煤油亦爲其附帶目的。而開發西比利亞。實爲［大陸政策］之一部。</p>
<p>殊不知蘇聨當局。並非愚　。十五年之不流血爭鬥。繼續努力。已收得相當佳良成果。故史塔林氏論其國防曰。</p>
<p>［一九三二年年底蘇聨生産。已較歐洲大戰前增加百分之三三四……。與五年計劃全部之差爲百分之六。其所以發生差遲之原因。係一部分鄰國拒絕簽訂不侵犯條約。及東方局勢之轉變。使一部分工廠。不得不轉其機。輪以製造新式武器。增强國防力所致。惟因此轉變蘇聨在國防方面之缺點。却已補足。蘇聨已自一無防禦力之弱國。成一富有防禦力之强國。其工業已能製造一切新式武器。對付任何外來之攻擊……］　　同時日本外務當局。對斯塔林氏講演之反響。據電通社所傳。</p>
<p>［日本軍部之所以在明年度預算中。要求龐大電事費者。乃鑒於蘇聨一面向日本要求締結互不侵犯條約。一面復使全國作戰爭準備。則現在日蘇兩國締結互不侵犯條約之可能性。亦歸消滅……］滅。</p>
<p>由此可知日蘇兩國間根本上之衝突。實萬無可避免。漁業協定煤油協定。均爲暫時利用性質。以撈魚及赤油購買和平。在蘇聨豈必有持久之意。在日本猶以爲未足。即全部占有漁業。亦僅只日本對外侵略企圖之開端。而占有中東路。囊括東北三省。庶幾可以滿足大陸政策之第一步。蘇聨雖勉力自制。盡全力於其内政之建設。但亦不作非理之退讓。故於［東方局勢之轉變。…（乃不得不）製造新式防禦武器。增强（其）國防力。］日本即借此口實。陡增其軍費豫算至於八億二千萬日金。</p>
<p>（二）和平忍耐有一定限度</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌日趨深刻。資本主義之内部。矛盾愈見展開。日美之對立。益加劇烈。英美之間。尤欠調和。蘇聨際此時會。不難盡力維持和平。忍耐退讓。不作戎首。然和平忍耐。必有一定限度。非如我國之雍容大度。雖失地三百七十七萬六千七百方里。而亦處之泰然。隐忍求全以苟求和平者。故蘇聨戒於遠東局勢之複雜情勢。乃竭力警備。寗肯犧牲百分之六之寳貴建設。而從事於補足國防之缺點。</p>
<p>論兵力。蘇聨之常備兵有戰列軍團二十一個狙擊師團二十八。民兵師團四十一。騎兵師團。九民兵騎兵師團二。機械師團四。飛行中隊二百一十。氣球中隊十三。飛機數在一千六百以上。（海軍力極薄弱不足道）戰時能出兵幾何。殊難估計。就其現行徵兵制測之。不難有四百萬精兵。至於日本常備陸軍十七個師團。再加南滿路守備隊。台灣守備隊朝鮮憲兵陸軍飛行聨隊七個。海軍飛行母艦四艘。飛機一千四百架。（日本海軍雖爲三大海軍之一。但對蘇無用武之地。）戰時兵員决難超過三百五十萬。如日本軍閥爲軍事的冐險。輕於挑衅。侵入蘇聨境内。恐蘇聨將不再忍耐。必起而自衛也。</p>
<p>然日本軍閥。對敵方偵察。亦甚清悉。設使與蘇聨開戰。勝利之把握如何。其自身亦不免有擬問。而天寒地凍。一九二十年對西比利亞出兵之敎訓。又焉敢與蘇聨輕啓衅端。而自陷於泥沼。况今日之蘇聨。已非當日毫無國防準備者可比乎。是以日閥如不至瘋狂。亦不至於兵力侵入西比利亞如侵東北三省然。况日本帝國主義者。旣已着手侵占華北。我國縱使繼續不抵抗。仍須相當巨大之兵力。以維持其侵略的剥削。何有餘力以侵犯蘇聨。是則日蘇互不侵犯條約。縱由眞正擱淺而至於消滅。亦不過加緊衝突之急激。至於爆發戰爭。則尙須時間之醖釀與空間之激　也。</p>

<h3>維持菲列濱獨立原案</h3>
<p>此案通過爲美國農黨勝利</p>
<p>惟未能喚起菲人熱烈注意</p>
<p>路透社十七日華盛頓電今日參議院以六六票對二七票、維持菲列濱獨立原案、而將胡佛總統之否决打銷、參議員波拉在表决前發言、謂若美國欲待至完全和平與軍縮之日、則菲島將永不自由云、波拉對於在條約中規定菲島中立一議、不表同意、謂如美國守信而予以獨立則將使吾人在東方之道德尊嚴、爲人信任並爲人尊重云、當表决結果發表時、旁聽席中許多菲人掌聲大作、此案之通過、爲美國農黨之勝利、植糖者尤爲歡迎、蓋忌菲人之競爭也、此案將成法律、如菲島議會於一年内、接受此案、則在十年至十三年中、菲島可完全獨立、如菲島議會不於一年内接受之、則此問題又將入於紛擾之局</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十七日華盛頓電斐列濱獨立法律草案、前經美國參衆兩院先後通過、因胡佛總統加以否决、復發回國會、按照美國憲法、國會須以三分之二以上之大多數、再度通過原案、則總統之否决、始能打銷、本月十四日衆院業以二七四票對九四票、議决維持原案、今日參院又以六六票對二七票、作同樣决定、上項投票結果、皆歟　法定多數相符、似此十年後以獨立權畀予斐列濱羣島一案、業已成爲法律矣、</p>
<h3>將訴諸大理院説</h3>
<p>國民社十七日華盛頓電參議員波拉稱、苟欲保護美農業不受菲農産之競爭、捨通過此案外無他途、若仍保有菲島、勢不能對菲貨徵税、參議員柯浦關則聲稱、渠固知總統之否决、將被推翻、但就憲法言、此案理由實不甚强固、又謂此案定將經過大理院手續、將美國獲得菲島之歷史、通盤考量、菲島購自西班牙、若菲島可以放棄、則路易齊亞那齊州亦未嘗不可放棄云、</p>
<h3>菲議長仍不滿意</h3>
<p>國民社十八日馬尼剌電美參院重行通過菲島獨立案消息抵此後、未能喚起菲人熱烈注意、蓋一般菲人常隨獨立運動領袖之意志爲轉移、顯似認此案尙未能全合菲島之需要也、菲參院議長宼順聲稱、此案不能令菲人滿意、渠將再赴華盛頓、與國務卿史汀生共同工作、冀得一較佳之法案、觀此間已有數方面認宼順此語、表示渠已準備停止完全獨立之運動、寗使菲島永居自治領土地位、較爲有利、蓋史汀生現已反對菲島獨立主張、以極度之自治政府給予菲人故也、至此間對於派往華盛頓之獨立運動代表、具函贊成此案一層、亦頗多抨擊云、</p>
<h3>日本已表示歡迎</h3>
<p>電通社十八日東京電菲島獨立案、雖經胡佛總統行使否認權、而通過上院、日外務當局對之、抱如下之意嚮、在遠東和平之主動的立場之日本、實歡迎菲島之獨立、美雖極注意日本、而日本之對菲島、除關心於經濟外、他無所有也、故菲島獨立之結果、或反可緩和日美兩國國民之感情、然美於馬尼剌軍港、持有海軍根據地、至對遠東之武力的威脅依然存在、而不可忽視者也、所謂獨立案者、附有十年間之猶豫期間、其間若情形變化、或將再行否認、故於菲島方面、實不容甚樂觀也云、</p>
<h3>美日關係更深奥</h3>
<p>華聨社十八日東京電十七日之美國上院以六十六票對二十七票之多數、再通過菲島獨立案、關於菲島獨立後、美日之關係更加深奥、美國將以何種政策保全菲島之安全、則殊堪注目、聞民主·共和兩黨對於遠東政策、曾密商數次、雙方意見已趨完全一致、日所期待於羅斯福之親日政策、已　絕望矣、</p>
<p>世界新聞社云、去年日本長崎新聞曾發表［太平洋大戰論］鼓吹日美戰爭、本社曾譯出刋布、最近該報又載同性質之論文一篇、題爲［支那四億元之市塲之爭奪］、文中亦謂日美戰爭之不可免、茲將其論雙方戰時形勢之部分譯出、以供讀者參考、</p>
<p>（上略）軍艦之比率（對美比率）雖根據倫敦條約、一九三六年時爲主力艦十（美）對六（日）、補助艦十（美）對七（日）、但在目前則日本在實數上勝過美國、然即</p>
<h3>美國分爲兩國</h3>
<p>州議院中有趣的提案</p>
<p>路透社十七日俾斯馬克電美國北達科太州參議院中、今日有州參議員　馬丁者、提出驚人議案、主張將美國分爲兩國、謂東方諸州損人利已、東方諸州皆富、而他州則不然、故渠主張分爲兩國、東方九州即紐漢浦夏州·凡芒州·麻州·梅恩州·紐約州·本塞爾凡尼亞州·康納克提克州·紐遮西州與羅德島家一國、用條　旗、其餘三十九州、另成一國、用星旗云、此案現暫擱未議、</p>
<p>至一九三六年、日本亦决不示弱、又屆時［滿洲國］當亦　多艘之軍艦造成、但日本雖曾與之結攻守同盟之約、然因自國兵力綽乎有餘、無向之借用之必要也、日本爲細長形之國家、故如美國從軍艦施放大砲攻我、必無多大效果、必須以飛機爲主體、目下美國雖擬陸續將飛行機賣入中國、且在中國建造飛行塲、然此種舉動、有悖國際條約、在日本睨視之下、美方諒不敢甘冒不韙、即使其果眞實現、然易於攻擊日本之飛行塲、亦必易於遭日本之攻擊、故利害仍彼此相抵、故美國當不出此舉、祗能大量建造飛行母艦、以滿載飛機運至日本附近耳、對此、日本亦有應付方法、可以遠派潛水艦至美國之附近、襲擊其飛行母艦、於此、美國必出其陳舊之圓形陣之戰略、將飛行母艦、戰鬥巡洋艦、潛水艦及其他大艦隊、精心配列爲一大圓陣、迴避日本之潛水艦、來到日本之附近、如此可以防免日本飛行機之襲擊、</p>
<p>又美國之來攻日本、可以取道三方面、㈠自亞羅新羣島直衝日本之北海道、㈡自夏威夷菲列濱直衝日本之九州、取此二道、雖在途中有歇足之便利、但此兩戰策、均爲侵襲日本之兩端、故其效果薄、不能予日本以致命傷、至於第三道係一鼓而直趨日本之中央東京灣、此在中途雖有不能歇足之困難、然其威脅日本之效果較大、故據日本專門家之意見推測、美國必選擇此中央之一路、</p>
<p>如美國果由此來襲、則日本不免稍困、蓋日本爲細長形之國家、故敵如以大砲攻我、可無須憂慮、然苟以飛機到處擲彈、則在我爲一大窘事、第一、在九州地方三菱佐世保及八幡製鐵所均相毘連、適予敵人以一舉炸燬之方便、且在全日本、八幡爲唯一之製鐵所、故吾人以爲有在他處分設一所之必要、而昭和製鋼所、亦以從早遷移至一較適宜之地點爲妙、</p>
<h3>葡京大風災</h3>
<p>大樹連根拔起屋頂揭去</p>
<p>躉船六艘爲巨浪所激沉</p>
<p>國民十七日里斯本電葡京今日發生大暴風、災情之烈、爲多年來所罕見、城内電線多爲風吹斷、大樹都連根拔、多處房屋之頂、爲風揭去、港内船隻、所受損失尤重、有　船六艘、爲浪激沉、船員經極端困難、倖得救起、此次財産損失數目必巨、惟生命之喪失者、現尙未有確實之報告云、</p>
<p>復次、美國之來攻、或不限於正面攻擊、而分三路來攻、亦未可知、果然、則日本亦不得不分三路應之又假定敵方失敗、然敗軍必鼠竄出没於東洋之海上、而爲患於海上之商人、蓋彼等如威脅開往中國南洋及歐洲之日本商船、則將使日本不能經商、爲預防起見、日本軍艦不得不到處巡邏以盡其保護商船之職責、如此、則不啻陷於持久戰之狀態中、但爲事實上所無可奈何者也、</p>
<p>復次美國在大西洋彼岸有歐洲可與之通商、故在貿易方面所感困難、不如日本之甚、此點亦爲日本不利之處、故日本必須努力使菲列濱眞正獨立、取得檀香山、且須無倦地警戒亞細亞之海防、此則我海軍當局之責任也、（下略）</p>

<h3>對美商之暴行</h3>

<p>美大使要求内田立即調查</p>

<p>路透社十八日東京電美大使訪外相内田請立即調查摀毁勝家公司案、並將來對於美人生命財産予以充分之警察保護、内田當即依允　請、勝家公司代表估計損失達日金數十萬元、日蛤僱員七人受重傷、暴衆被拘者一百三十八人、</p>

<p>希物勒抵柏林談判</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十七日柏林電今日午後希特勒抵此、立即與右派國權黨首領胡根堡舉行重要會議、事前希特勒曾與巴本前總理在電話中交談、籌備此項會晤、若干人士以爲此次希特勒謀與胡根堡接近、以視去年八月及十一月間、成功希望較多、但希氏對於與施萊轍總理合作一層、始終不欲考慮、故政局仍屬混亂、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十八日柏林電國社黨宣稱、希特勒不欲發起與施萊轍總理會晤、但彼將留柏林、直至星期日爲止、俾得繼續談判、此外負責方面、謂施總理將於星期五日、接見巴維耶邦天主敎黨總理賴希脱、但不擬接見其他政黨領袖、惟自由黨機關報伏錫志日報則謂施萊轍與希特勒會晤之企圖、迄未放棄、該報又謂星期五日、聨邦衆議院國社黨議長葛隣、循例與施萊轍會見、商議衆院議事日程時、對於上述之會晤、黨可有所决定云、</p>

<p>八年度預算中的匡救費二億七百萬元、主管機關爲内務與農林兩部、内務部的匡救費撥充築路·治水·修築港灣等事業上去、其中部費九一·六二○○○○元地方費若干元、總額爲一憶四千四百九萬二千元、政府説、這種土木事業、能夠收容農村的失業人口、是一種失業救濟策、但其實所謂［匡救、］也不過是頂頂它的名罷了、什麽築路啦、治水啦、修築港灣啦、不是和上面所述的諸軍事施設一樣、是戰爭及擾亂的端倪麽、正確的説、這些也都是軍事費、但不管官是否軍事費、只問它能否利用此項經費去救濟失業者不、匡救費中、土木事業費中有六七成是木材·鐵料·及西門汀等原料、都是昂貴的輸入品、其餘的部分、便給技師和包工的瓜分去了、同時、失業者逾三百五十萬人、旣分霑不到一文工資、而他們生活上必需的消費品、（米及其他）則因通貨的膨脹、而飛漲起來了、政府説、每人平均的工資、以七十錢計算、八年度可以收容人員一億一千三百四十二萬人、如果依他所説的充預算的總額以作工資、也還怕不夠呢、故實際上添雇的不及十萬人、即使多些、也是拿不到工資的了、不寗惟是、地方的負担、還要向勞苦大衆身上層層榨取其公租公税呢、</p>
<p>財政大臣高橋氏説、［我相信時局匡救費若能繼續的維持三年、所期的效果、可以、</p>
<p>盡舉、］接着又説、［大家可以安心、經過三年後、人人都可富裕起來、至昭和十年時、且可增税了、］這分明是宣傳［空繁榮］遭失敗的一種胡佛式的空論</p>
<p>再看農林部的匡救事業費、分爲三項、</p>
<p>㈠農村土木工程費、四八·四一○○○</p>
<p>○元</p>
<p>㈡復興農村經濟更生設施費、三·二三○○○○元、</p>
<p>㈢米榖貯藏奬勵費、五·○○○○○○元</p>
<p>合計五六·六四○·○○○元</p>
<p>㈠土木工程費的處置、也和内務部裏的一樣、或以低工銀、或是無工錢、的强制工人工作於軍事設施的工塲、尤其在現今澈底貧窮的農村中、還要强課捐税、且以物租去緩和抗租的鬥爭、至於那些連米麥木炭等、（除繭外）也不能繳納的農民、則以强制勞役代替租税、</p>
<p>㈡復興農村經濟更生設施費、亦不過是一種設立副業與小組合的暫時救濟策罷了、對於中貧農、差不多是不適用的、</p>
<p>㈢米榖貯藏奬勵費、因爲米是比較可以久貯的、故最近有糙米貯藏奬勵法施行、但亦不過是戰時糧食政策的一種罷了、獲利的不是中貧農、却完全是地主與富農們、</p>
<p>（國債費）</p>
<p>政府擬以公債彌補鉅額的虧損、故八年度又發行新規公債十二億圓、現在的公債數額已達六十四億圓、加上七年度公債的未發行額、總計起來、公債數額已有八十億圓之鉅了、利息以五厘計、共需四億圓、加上因匯兑跌價而追加的利息一億元、共需五億圓、這五億圓的利意、白白的流到金融資本家手中去了、利息的來源、歸根逃不出增税或發行新公債二途、前者這裏不説、後者公債的增發、現在已有日本銀行承担、日本銀行承担了這項公債、又將無限制的發行其兌換劵、使通貨膨脹、（即流通貨幣過剩）物價騰貴、使勞若大衆於不知不覺之間、使勞動力的價格更形低賤、但日本帝國主義的當局、爲要澈底實行其黷武政策、　這種政策、在本質上是不能避免的、歲出年年膨脹無已、同時因勞苦大衆的貧窮狀態、愈陷愈深、租税的收入、越加相對的减少了、於是又不得不再行增發公債、</p>
<h3>預算之目的在於戰爭</h3>
<p>這裏、最重要的是軍事費之意義的解釋及其範圍的限定、御　用的報紙、社會民主主義的評論家、以及進步的財政學者們、大都僅以上面説過的海陸軍費·及其直接附屬的設施費爲軍事費而抺殺了、今日日本預算的全部、都埋在軍事的設施下、以戰爭爲目的、這種固有意義、如敎育費中的增設理化研究所經費·及發明奬勵費等、都是以戰爭爲目的、而今日之戰爭與昔日之戰爭、大有不同、其動員的範　、及其使用武器種類·數量·食糧·等、至爲巨大、例如毒瓦斯之類、是無法貯藏的、所以目前最重要的是幾個軍事大工塲的準備、及盡量的使全産業中各大中小工塲轉化爲軍事工塲、例如賽璐郎工塲·肥　工塲·鑾爲火藥爆藥工塲、保險箱工塲之變爲坦克工塲、　達工塲之變爲毒瓦斯工塲、鐘錶工塲之變爲砲彈信管工塲、橡皮套鞋工塲之辦爲氣球製造廠、白　銅及銅製品工塲之變爲小槍工塲、人造絲製品工塲之變爲飛機漆料上用的皮膜工塲等是、</p>
<p>又關於戰鬥人員、戰爭第一次的動員、須一百萬人、長期的繼續戰爭下去、須有一千萬人的動員、僅僅二三十萬的現役兵士、無論如何是不夠的、於是日本帝國主義者、便爲後備軍·在鄕軍人·青年團·青年訓練　·消防隊等的系統訓練、（包括精神的諿練）而要求一切施、且不惜爲這些設施、支出其預算的一部分、這一切設施、雖不是直接爲兵士及兵器而消費、但都是與軍事有很重要的關係、所以若僅將名目上屬於海陸軍部或與其直接有關的項目、例如、外務部的滿洲事變費、［僞國新京］之司法領事館的設置費、財政部的憲兵司令部設置費、滿洲事變費的第一預備金、敎育部的航空研究統一試騐費、航空研究所飛機製造費、郵務部滿洲事件費、拓殖部的滿洲移民費等、算做軍事費、那是很錯誤的、</p>
<p>次如時局匡救費、也是直接以戰爭爲目的、日本政府爲减除其後顧之憂、可以一心從事戰爭起見、對於勞苦大衆貧窮化的傾向、不得不標榜一種［救濟］的招牌來、然而一方面所謂［匡救］、不過是爲免除政府地位的動搖、並不是眞心對勞苦羣衆及失業者有加以救濟、他方面、這種虚僞的［匡救］、不過是一種視當局者利益爲轉移的最小限度的［匡救］僅在某地方得不到實惠的、這些［匡救］僅在某地方軍事土木工程、或軍事産業工作上、冠上那好聽的［失業救濟］的美名罷了、待我們知道了所謂［匡救］原來是這麽一回事後、則［匡救費］之以戰爭爲目的、更無待辭費了、最後、那源源不息的將利錢輸入金融資本家手中的國債費、更其無庸説起了、</p>
<p>這樣、則知所謂軍事費者、不過專指那直接以戰爭爲目的者而言、其他經費、則是間接的、再説一句、整個的日本預算、是以戰爭爲目的、無論那一項目經費、都逃不出爲這個目的而消費、（未完）</p>
<h3>無錫</h3>

<p>南通平潮區、因徵收保衛捐、於上五日發生槍殺農民四人大血案、激起風潮、區畏王振　、捕鄕農沈宏奎等十四人解縣府、指爲暴民、有聚衆搶槍行爲、十六日經張縣長喜訊、本案　因沈宏奎應繳保衛捐五元六角、已納過三元、餘二元、約定二十日交付、區公所派鄕長陳澍舫、率保衛　二十餘捕沈、同時連带被捕者　有趙生等五名、沈等被捕後、被吊打、致徧體鱗傷、張縣長特區攝影存案、各鄕人均否認聚衆搶槍、至被槍殺之鄕民林扣等四人、係保衛團在區公所前開槍射擊、致鄕民憤而摀毁區公所、鄕民欲將死屍四具、抬城呼寃、經警隊阻止、刻鄕民極憤激、事態嚴重、未易收拾、十六日下午五時、張縣長趕往勘察、並安慰鄕民、並將案情電省核示、</p>

<p>長江船雪夜肇禍</p>
<h3>伏龍通和互撞</h3>
<p>損失在十萬元以上</p>
<p>連日天氣嚴寒、大雪不止、長江内發生伏龍通和兩輪互撞之禍、損失失巨大、本報記者特赴各方面詳細調查如下、</p>
<h3>雪夜兩船行一線</h3>
<p>本月十三日本埠三北公司長江船伏龍號、由滬運載大批貨件及旅客、開往漢口、出吳淞口後、天下大雪、伏龍輪經過鎭江、已在十四日晨三時、時正雪花紛飛、有和豐輪船公司通和輪、由浦口裝運煤一知六百噸來滬、亦於十四日晨三時、駛至鎭江上游約兩海里江面、以大雪飛舞江面空白、伏龍通和兩船竟走入同一航線、而未之察覺、</p>
<h3>兩輪互撞受巨創</h3>
<p>伏龍輪係上水、通和下水、兩船於雪夜中未能辯别、及至相近、雙方始各發　、乃互相驚愕、欲行退讓而已不及、通和輪船頭部與伏龍輪中艙部、害突然猛撞、兩輪均爲重儎、故猛撞後、伏龍大艙立刻洞破、江水狂冲入内、貨物盡陷水中、乘客均避至前後艙、通和輪之船頭亦完全撞毁、並失落巨鐵錨一頭、</p>
<h3>通和已開滬大修</h3>
<p>出事之後、通和即行趕開來滬、卸去煤斤、至董家渡耶松廠大修、三北之伏龍輪、在被撞後危險異常、經船主命令急開南京、將各艙貨物卸出、旅客亦令在京上陸、因船體將下沉、不能再赴漢口、一面電告滬局、將該輪設法拖還上海、水漬貨損害極大、昨日下午方到上海、在京貨客、改派他船轉去漢口、</p>
<h3>今日檢騐損失數</h3>
<p>昨日下午經和豐三北兩輪公司會同報告航政局、請求局長何瀚瀾氏派技師、至兩船檢騐撞壞情形、並查究兩船此次肇禍之責任問題、檢騐地點、在董家渡老船塢、旋因雪大而伏龍尙未到來、航政局遂决定改於今日上午、至董家渡檢騐、聞此次兩輪互撞損失、須在十萬元以上、</p>

<h3>鄭之家世</h3>

<h3>長女月仙</h3>
<p>年華二八、麥容娟秀、天生敏巧、惟心靜而固執、前年在吳淞女學校肄業、各項課程、均稱完美、對於中西文之研究、最有心得、去年遂考入虹口某耶穌敎會住讀、不知受何剌激、忽萌厭世之念、特於前（十四）日午後二時、由天通菴乘淞滬客車至淞旗站下車、步赴砲台灣海濱、</p>
<h3>蹈海自殺</h3>
<p>迄今已四百日、旣無生存確息、又無屍體發現、迨伊父得悉、遍訪無踪、遂報告救生局及公安局水巡隊上海水巡捕房等各機關、請爲注意、該女生截髮時裝、身穿紅毛葛長旗袍、足登黑色漆皮鞋、絲襪、查其自殺原因、則據稱該女生於去年西歷冬至放假回家、住宿兩夜、赴校後、曾經致函其最知交之女友、（即房東徐姓之女）函内有國家杌𣕕、東隣强侵、憤不欲生等語、此函爲徐女之父所見、遂密告伊父鄭某、得訊赴校、當面諄諄勸誠、見其已有悟意而返、初不料其自殺之念已决、而演此慘劇、令人莫測、殊堪嘆惜、惟其中尙有</p>

<h3>仇人發六槍未能命中</h3>

<p>朋友講義氣······善堂中苦鍊功夫</p>
<p>賃居浦東花園橋西首桃園宅一百二十號門牌之北平人姚鴻聲、於本月十五日午後六時許、被人連放六槍、園殺未成、行兇疑犯、業被公安局三區拘獲、爰探得案情顚末、詳誌於下、</p>
<h3>愛好同居</h3>
<p>姚現年三十七歲、在曩昔青年時代、曾在杭州某軍部下充當兵士、漸與該地居民相熟、因此與杭州女子葉氏結不解緣、其時該氏年方十七、正當妙齡、貌亦不惡、故兩人情愛彌篤、姚遂脱離軍隊生活、帶氏來滬、租屋同居、儼成夫婦、嗣姚又領一少女名彩玉（現已十三歲）居家、配與乃姪爲童養姪媳、姚爲人勤儉耐勞、數年前經人介紹於浦東華通棧三區派出所内充當伙夥、竟陸續積存、現蓄不下五六千金之鉅</p>
<h3>乘病捲逃</h3>
<p>詎於前年五月間、姚不幸身罹瘧疾、遂去職居家醫治、無如此症時續發作、歷一年餘、竟成癆病、甚至臥牀不想、勢成絕望、英氏時已二十七歲、與姚同居十載、並無生育、此時目覩姚已奄奄埀斃、爲自身前途計、遂與本地人陸龍寳姘識、相約乘姚病重不察之際、捲取銀洋衣飾、値價一千餘金、挈同童姪媳彩寳、隨陸逃避無踪、</p>
<h3>鍊武療病</h3>
<p>姚有至友高某、係在本埠善堂内服務、見此情狀、以姚病危之候、該葉氏竟忍心出此手段、實替姚、掬同情之淚、遂自告奮勇、雇人將病人舁赴堂内、代爲延醫、盡心療治、爲時月餘、絕症竟有起色、漸能離牀行走、高本人向精國術、乃令姚逐日鍊習、姚以重生之身、故唯高命星聽、不數月、非特病竟霍然、且鍊得數套武術、體格亦日益强壯、遂出堂回家休養、但每日必黎明起身鍊術、現下兩臂孔武有力、已三五人不能與敵、</p>
<h3>六槍不中</h3>
<p>陸與葉氏見姚尙在人世、且苦鍊國術不輟、恐遭復仇暗算、乃託人向姚調解、姚即提出條件二則、㈠將姪媳彩玉送還、㈡賠償捲去銀洋衣飾、但陸自認已將彩玉賣去、無法送還、損失一項、願賠給洋二百元、旋又加至二百五十元、嗣調人往返接洽、並無效果、於是陸爲先發制人計、率衆至姚居處開槍圖殺、姚見來勢不佳、即持花槍（即紅纓槍）抵抗、陸等連放六槍、並未命中、遂分投逃散、</p>
<h3>主犯在逃</h3>
<p>當晚姚投報三區警署、請求追緝、並稱陸偕來者、發見與其鄰居之奚林華·奚瑞寳三人、亦混在其中、計陸開兩槍、林華開兩槍、及一不相識者開兩槍等情、該區當即派警先後得兩奚拘案、據林華供認事前從中調解有之、並未隨陸行兇云云、瑞華則供稱未聞其事、詎昨日公安局偵緝隊聞悉主犯匿於公共租界提藍橋某旅館内、當即派員前往拘捕、已被聞風逃逸、張區長昨將兩被告連　姚家拾獲之子彈壳兩枚、備文解送總局訊究、</p>

<h3>報捕窮追</h3>
<p>余懾於淫威、祇得將車煞停、被迫下車、余下車後、卽由一人司機、將車開去、當時余四顧無人、但仍捨命追趕、約數十武、遇華捕、具以實告、華捕偕余繼續西追、直追抵亞爾培路十三層大厦相近、尙遙見紅燈一點、閃爍於白雪之中、倐已不見云云、</p>
<h3>捕房調查</h3>
<p>捕房據報後、立卽飭派値日中西包探、帶同車夫至新永安街十六號錦發行詢問、頃間是否有人被匪綁去、據答並未有人被綁、且毫無所聞、復詰之長發旅社、亦無端倪、探等遂將該車夫帶歸捕房、反復細詰、而該車夫仍堅持原供、捕頭無奈、命暫扣留候查、一而分電公共租界各捕房及華界公安局、請爲注意、但截至發稿時、汽車尙未發現、</p>

<h3>小販與文學界</h3>
<p>丨李永明君來信丨</p>
<p>鄙人擬請敎貴記者一件非自已的見識所能够解决的事情：自去年失業以後、因尋　職業困難，以致困頓到今。覺得如此下去，終　了局。最近給鄙人找到一個辦法，就是一邊做小販維持生活，一邊就我之所好，去在文藝方面，努力修養。鄙人平時對於文學很有興味，所以願意在這方面有點收穫。但有二個疑問：㈠鄙人的學力不過高小程度眼看現　在所有中國的文學作家，不是大學生就是留學博士，像鄙人這樣的　力，可以作自修的基礎嗎？㈡［誠之所至，鐵石爲開。［天下無難事，只怕有心人。］這些［套話］，是不是［封建］［資産］階級拿來麻醉人的［話］？依唯物論的眼光看來，這些［話］似乎有些靠不住？以上兩個疑問（鄙人自已以爲是疑問）請略爲分析，以免誤人歧途，則幸甚！</p>
<p>覆：足下所問兩點，分條答覆如下：現代［中國的文學作家一雖然］不是大學生就是留學博士］，這些作家並不妨碍你這樣一個［一邊做小販維持生活，一邊訓練自已］的作家。因爲大學生或留學博士的作家大半是在明窗淨几中去創作［他們的一文學作品，或是在鋼絲床上，鴨絨被窩裏構想他的描寫對象。［他们的一作品儘管是銷行很廣，也不是［一般民衆所愛讀，所能讀的東西。他們有閒情逸致談什麽戀愛，他們却不顧而且不能實地去描寫貧民的痛苦，縱使他們願意，至多也不過表示一點［憐惜］之意，决不能完全站在一條戰綫上，替貧民做思想上的戰士，對着他們的壓迫者或剥削者，運用其批評的武器。所以我以爲：眞正的文學家，即革命的作家中，或許也有大學生或外國博士，然而自命爲中國作家的大學生或外國博士，未必就是我們眼中的作家。倒是足下這樣一個人物，只要有志的話，實在大有做一個革命作家的希望。因爲：你是嘗過經濟壓迫和社會壓迫的滋味，並且現在正在［嘗］，你若是有了作品，那一定是民衆的呼聲，一定爲民衆暴露不良的政治社會之黑暗的描寫，我以爲你大有努力做這種文學家的資格。古今中外有許多卓越的天才作家都是來自學徒或出身微賤，並不是什麽大學生，也不是什麽大博士，如美國的大科學家，大政治家，大著作家富蘭克令和蘇俄大文學家富爾基就是一個好例這是一。所謂［誠之所至，金石爲開］，所謂［天下無難事，只怕有心人］等　的話，原是前人經歷有得之言，並不一定就是［封建］［資産］階級拿來麻醉人的［套話一，］</p>
<p>不過你要知道，若果有人離開了物質的條件，離開了當前的事實不管，求給你講什麽正心誠意，説什麽有心無心，那就不免是你所説的［查産階級］的欺騙。譬如現在日本人打到中國來·我們不去拚命·不去收覆失地·反而鎭日價在［念佛］在講［仁義道德］·提倡什麽［廉恥節操］·高唱什麽［和平奮鬥］那都是［鬼話］！因爲他們抛開當前的事實而去掉弄玄虚。唯物論者並不反對人有志趣，恰恰相反，只有唯物論者才能眞正認清自然的法則和歷史的法則，奮勇地去適應，這種法則以變革社會，驅使自然，以造福人類。唯物論者更不反對人立［誠］。恰恰相反，只有他才能，也只有他才敢大無畏地站在時代的前面，赤裸裸地批評自已的錯誤，批評人的錯誤，這就是［誠］；只有他才能，也只有他才敢大無畏地站在時代的前面，奮不顧身，朝斯夕斯地爲最大多數人類謀幸福，這也就是［誠］。足下要立志［一邊做小販，一邊作文藝］，那就毫不猶疑地努力幹去！</p>

<h3>對於國貨界之小貢獻</h3>
<p>— 白虹</p>
<p>近來市上，發見攺頭換面的新國貨眞多極了。尤其是四頭，針織等貨的新牌子，更不可記數。這種魚目混珠的妙策，實在令人拜服那般人的聰明才智。</p>
<p>可是這種假面目，是不難戳穿的。你只　問他製造所在什麽地方，凡眞國貨，店員們當然立可回答，至少亦可查詢。假的，便要瞠目不能對了。</p>
<p>所以我希望各國貨廠家，以後凡是出品上或包裝上，務必將製造廠及發行所的地址，詳細註明在上面。庶幾眞僞立判，並且一方面可使買主隨時調查，一方面更可提高自家的信用。</p>
<p>在重重壓迫下國貨應</p>
<h3>怎樣謀出路（三）</h3>
<p>— 杜重達</p>
<p>在此種情形之下，於是乃天然成爲羣雄然逐之鵠的，本來百年以來我國即可以任人登堂入室一無阻碍，國家所仰賴爲生命線的關税，到今日仍然桎梏在條約之下，爲人所握持！各資本主義國旣閙着生産無從出處，感到上天無路，入地無門的當兒，自以我國爲唯一的逐鹿之塲所。他們採了［投併］政策，把中國做他們的大主顧。即如日本自從實行對華武力侵略以後，他們在華貿易佔着最優勢的地位，因爲全中國一致屏棄日貨，受到很大的打擊，更受到世界環境的惡劣影響，經濟恐慌達於極點，於是更加緊的對我用傾銷方法，將貨價特别的减低，激起華人的購買力，再想吮吸國人最後一些的膏血。在此種情况之下，所以雖然有孫中山先生偉大的建國遺敎，亦無從着手！我國實業桎梏在帝國主義者政治與經濟的壓迫之下，長久地徬徨在埀斃的暮境，無法進入新的階段，到現在確已踏上了生死的關頭。現在國内一般知識分子，排除一切艱難，自辦各種工業的却也不少，對於國貨中似乎放出了一線曙光；但是根據上述種種情况，我們如果要謀我國貨的出路，一定要有齊備幾個先决條件。</p>
<h3>康元廠明日之廠工訓練</h3>
<p>— 靄吳</p>
<p>康元廠主項君之　曰；本廠之廠工訓練，雖　相當效果，猶以爲未足，乃有明日之廠工訓練計費。廠工訓練，在在與環境發生密切之關係，環境良則易爲力，環境惡則收效難，本廠四周，市面日見繁盛，而誘我廠工之廣物亦日增，旣不能使廠工與社會隔絕，又無法使廠工如入定老僧，冥然罔覺，則惟有效孟母之三遷，擇仁里以自處。蓋　蕕同器，十年亦臭，染絲之　，豈獨墨子。本廠戕於若干年後，擇相當地點而遷焉。其域之廣須五百畝，築斯城也，鑿斯池也，植果木，關塲　，開學校，立醫院，創商肆，設樂園，而並爲之備公墓，使本廠别成一新世界。全廠廠工，衣於斯，食於斯，敎育於斯，娱樂於斯，養生送死亦於斯廠爲廠工之大家庭，廠爲廠工之姚花源。至是我亦不復知知康元之　工廠爲學校爲社會爲國家，凡此理想世界，縈回於腦際者已有年，而實現尙待來日，我無以名之，姑名之曰明日之廠工訓練。</p>
<h3>貢獻於國貨介紹所</h3>
<p>— 潘仰䒪</p>
<p>近今各地熱心國産的人士，在這次國貨運動中，致力於國貨介紹所的工作；爲社會服務，極可欽佩，而不避艱困，從事於有效力的基本工作，這實在是足以表揚的事件。數月來，重慶，青島，汕頭，厦門，廣西，廣州各地，都有代表來滬接洽，更有採及　蕘，枉駕下問的，除關於特殊問題，隨時貢獻外，還有一些小貢獻，希望我同志共回討論，努力實現。</p>
<p>國貨介紹所目的，不祗陳列國貨一項，其主要的使命，實在紹介方面，所以調查工作，是國貨介紹所的基本工作。最近市塲情形和國貨狀况，我們固然要明白，而本地及其附近的人民習尙，何種貨物較爲適宜的推銷，這許多也是國貨介紹所應給予生産界的帮助。在國貨運動中的介紹所，好比婚姻中的介紹人一般，生産界與消費者間的連絡，多靠著介紹所作媒介。</p>
<p>在這含有抗敵性的國貨連動中，因爲外貨的深入内地，國貨代用品的介紹，尤其是釜底抽薪的善良方法此項重大的使命，國貨介紹所自然責無旁貸。好在這并不是局部問題，各地國貨界果能通力合作，同時作採集的工作，并且互相參考，不必經過多少麻煩，便可以完成。九一八以後中華國貨介紹所（華龍路八十號）曾編有國貨目錄，更集有國貨代用日貨的材料，大可以給各地國貨介紹所作參考。</p>
<p>國貨原料問題，一方影響於國貨的定價，而原産地的社會經濟，對之更有密切的關係。各地國貨介紹所假如能將本地和附近的原料向外介紹，生産界固然可獲很大的利益；可是向外介紹以後因爲提倡和改良，在瀕於絕境的内地經濟組織，却也得有帮助。希望各地主持的同志，爲著整個的國家經濟着想，毫不猶豫的負起這項繁難的使命！</p>
<p>總之，投身於國貨介紹事業，完全是爲著社會服務著想，爲他人帮助成功而自已不希望利益；各地主持和從事於國貨介紹所的同志，精神和决心，都是足爲我們敬佩的。可是，我們仍希望各地的同志們，更進一步的打破了人我的分别，認定這事業便是我自已的事業，盡力的向前邁進；那末，將來國貨介紹所的成功，誰能不説是我們的成功呢！</p>
<h3>吾國紡織業今後之出路（下）</h3>
<p>— 朱仙舫</p>
<p>（甲）營業合理化；不尙投機；出品求簡單；原棉求常符標準（乙）工作合理化；節縮開支（丙）政府動行保護政策（丁）金融界擴大紡織投資爲有力之合作（戊）國人購用國産織物</p>
<p>丙政府勵行保護政策</p>
<p>農工爲國家之唯一生産份子，政府當予以有力之獎掖及保護，保護工業之道，在使全國生産與消費適符其量，勿使外貨輸入，擾吾市塲，而致華商工廠受其打擊，故高其關壁壘，杜絕外貨輸入，即所以維護國内工業也。但關税提高，外商變更策略，以不平等條約爲護符，挾其精美機械，優良技術，來吾通商口岸興立工廠，而穏率固以平等爲原則不容稍有軒　，則獎勵之道尙已。就紡織業言，國産原棉數量不充，織維且失於粗短，不能用以紡精細之紗，仍有一部份仰給於外棉輸入，則低其税率，使勿因税重而加大成本，棉布爲吾可成之物，有外貨傾銷，低至成本以下，蒙受損失之憂，則高其税率，杜其傾銷，於國内紡織廠，不論華商洋商，一例提高統税，於華廠，將提高之數，移充獎勵金，如是華廠得有力之維護，可不受傾軋，日進於繁榮之途，善夫中委吳鐵城氏於三中全會，有維護紡織業提案，是吾紡織業之福音，竊願政府於本年五月中日互惠恊訂屆滿時，能勵行者矣。</p>
<p>丁金融界擴大紡織投資爲有力之合作</p>
<p>銀行錢莊，所以調劑工商業金融之盈虚也，工商業能否發展，金融業之榮枯繫之，工商業必賴金融界調劑，始有發展可能，金融界亦必因工　業發展，始可進展其業務，故金融界與工　業，實同其榮枯，鍥而不舍也，不走於二十一年［國難新年中策進紡織業之建議］已　明其説，查上海商業儲蓄銀行二十年度營業報告，投資於工業者共爲二千三百餘萬元，占放欵總額百分之三十四·三○·投資於紡織業者，占工業投資總額百分之四十二·七八·二十一年度紡織投資總額，進而爲一千四百餘萬兩，較二十年度約增百分之四十二，中國銀行稱是，是微二行維護工業，而尤重視紡織業，良以棉織物爲民生最低限度之需求，國有紡　織繼之總産額，距衣能自給程度甚遠，固大有發展可能，二行能詳悉底蘊，助紡織業至於進展，足令欽佩其眼光之偉大矣。固願賡續所爲而擴大之，尤願整個金融界，在外貨倾度銷棉業業務，較衰之餘，能效二行所爲，與棉業爲有力之合作，紡織實有因成品存積稍多，周轉欠靈者，予　調劑，勿迫致於不可有爲，周轉欠靈之廠，不妨將業務實况相告，請爲有力之　護，精誠團結，相與諒解，相爲維　，庶彼傾銷暴力無由得逞，吾紡織業能由維持現狀而進於發展，　見最後勝利之不我屬也。</p>
<p>戊國人購用國産織物</p>
<p>國産織物，爲國内製成之品，國人以錢易布，紡織廠即以易得之錢，購置國産原棉，製爲織物，如是金錢循環於農工商之間，而無外溢之患，九一八後，國人羣起爲抗貨運動，於是輸入鋭減，國貨工廠一時勃興，固足予彼以極大創傷，而爲我培養國力之要圖，彼稔知我國人之貪得廉價貨物也乃施行傾銷政策，大量輸入，棉貨爲尤巨，倘國人仍堅其抗貨素願，視之若龐土，雖無價貨與，亦拒而不受，紡織工廠，又　至蒙受影響，不能措施裕如。但國力疲敝，外患日亟，非充實力量，無以袪外患而固疆圉，非購用國貨，拒置外貨，無以杜外溢之利，而自食其力。竊願國人堅禦侮信念，採購國貨，使國有金錢，永循環於吾農工商之間，則彼傾銷暴力雖加，而購置與否，爲吾絕對自由，必將無以肆其能矣。</p>
<p>下走憂心國外棉貨傾銷，予吾紡織當業以打擊，而吾紡織業之信念不堅，自甘偃伏，故作今後出路之設計，以爲蒭堯之獻，　亦紡織當業所樂聞，而亦政府及社會人士所願爲者乎？</p>
<h3>科學管理法下之推銷問題</h3>
<p>程守中君在國外研究推銷問題很久，回國後担任復旦人夏　大學商學院敎授，　關於國内國貨推銷問題，仍繼續探討，不遺餘力，日前工商管理協會邀請程君講演推銷問題，此乃其講演紀錄也。（治也記）</p>
<p>推銷是因爲生産而發生的，有了生産即必須要有推銷，在經濟學上有密切的關係。但是我們中國的廠家，對推銷問題認爲不重要，當我遇到幾位工廠的朋友，他們都説不要推銷，這雖然不能説多數廠家都有這種心理，但是好多國貨廠家的確因爲生意太好而忙的利害，不再顧到推銷問題。可是據我個人觀察，目下國貨生産界如此發達的原因，是因爲我們提倡國貨的緣故，在市塲學上講，購買的動機完全基於情感，乃是情感的動機；而顧客講買尙有理性的動機和惠顧的動機，外國人用很大的廣告費推銷力量來和我們競爭，我們國貨工廠家能否抵抗，乃是一個嚴重的問題，所以我們中國廠家應即注意到推銷問題，這是我的意見之第一點。</p>
<p>已往中國工商業推銷國貨，依照經騐和猜想，并不經科學方法的數字計算，以致常有不甚圓滿的結果，這是非常重要的，所以希望能用科學方法來解决；　　㈠市塲調查，藉以了解市塲情形；</p>
<p>㈡分析市塲調查的結果并加以設計；</p>
<p>㈢訓練售貨人，因爲上海有得多店家的售貨人給予顧客有不良的印象，影響推銷問題很大。（未完）</p>

<h3>從布后生女聨想到女子過剩</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>數千年前重男　　的詩人，生了男子，哼什麽［戴弄之璋，戴寢之　；］生了女子，哼什麽［戴弄之瓦，載寢之地；］男女的階級，軒鐸到這般地步！讀了這幾句時，誰都要睡駡　腦筋陳舊思想落伍的古代詩人！却不料在那男女平權的歐洲文明世界，也會在嗚砲上面，表示着重男輕女和我國的古代詩人一鼻孔出氣，這是値得喚一聲奇哉又怪哉了！本報載十三日布加利亞京城！蘇菲亞電；布京民衆都失望於得到王后座女消息丨隔夕，　聞王后分娩，都會集於王宫以外，希望得到誕生儲君的喜信；砲聲隆隆，價是報告生子生女的消息，生子鳴砲一百另一響，生女僅有二十一　；聽砲的民衆，誰都興高彩烈，但是，二十一　以後，便告沈寂了，於是，無數歡顔，都成爲懊喪狀態！</p>
<p>生子生女的鳴砲有八十響的差異，哼！男女平權在那喪呢？本來，物以希而見貴，歐洲各國自大戰後，常患着女子過剩，芬蘭國的民衆，平均計算，一男對三女，於是女　子便有三分之二的過剩；國中商店，郵局，工廠的員工人數，都是女倍於男，老閩女終身不得其偶的，更是指不勝屈。其他，西班牙也閙着女子過剩，全國民衆的平均表，也是一男對三女，自從趕走國王亞方朔以後，共和政府國會女議員的人數，立時激增；要是，到了中國人口中，便要道一句［陰盛陽衰］了。</p>
<p>自從日人犯順以來，雙方戰士的長期犧牲，也是造成女子過剩的發動機；而且，兵禍一經擴大，便有世界大戰第二次爆發的可能，那麽，女子過剩的問題，又要成爲世界問題了！唉！</p>
<h3>兩個反比例</h3>
<p>— 龐紫蘇</p>
<p>偶然被我想起了中國有兩件事情，和美國比較一下，却恰成爲數學中的反比例。</p>
<p>先說第一個反比例</p>
<p>一七七三年，美洲英國殖民地的英國人，因爲英政府實行加税，所以起來反抗，表示不甘屈服，甚至毆打官吏的事，時時發生。某一次有艘英國的茶船。到了波士敦港，不料有五十個所謂波士敦茶黨的黨徒，一閧上船，把三百四十箱茶都投入海裏。結果釀成戰爭，美洲英國殖民地的英國人，終於獨立成美國。</p>
<p>一八四○年，因爲中國人燒了英商的鴉片，便惹成鴉片之戰，結果，中國非但賠欵；並且還開了五口通商。</p>
<p>照理，鴉片是違警的東西，旣失金錢，又損身體，有禁止的必要。拿美國獨立這回事來作個榜樣，我們中國應該比美國更要大打其勝仗，那知結果與美國適成一個反比例。</p>
<p>這一個反比例，就是堕落中華民族到［次殖民地］的發端。</p>
<p>再説第二個反比例；</p>
<p>近年來，我們中國急劇的和美國同化；尤其是智識階級的製造所的大學裏，更是無可諱言。</p>
<p>小至嘴裏吃的糖果，非别趣納的各種菓子糖和美女牌的葡萄乾則不取，試問，那一樣不是由美國運來的？</p>
<p>本來，這種高度資本主義的産物，享受無妨；但是我們需要明瞭，中國的生産却是十八世紀的生産呀！</p>
<p>［十八世紀的生産，二十世紀的消費，］這不是數學中的反比例麽？因此，中國就淪爲半殖民地，丨資本主義過剩生産的尾閭。</p>
<p>殘冬小品</p>
<h3>丨賣花聲丨</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>從前在蘇州，清晨靜得很，冬天更添了淡淡的幽悄。老愛倚在枕上·閉着眼·貪聽那遠巷傳來的賣花聲。只要尖着耳聽·會給您以音樂的美感，不似　啼，不似琵琶；也會給您以詩的靈感，能陶醉於酥軟的甜香的那個境界。</p>
<p>在我，一想到花便會心跳，這花又是從美麗的小姑娘的嘴唇裏，用纏綿的悠長的加圓潤的蘇州音曼聲地唱；我的心便抖戰了。每個早晨，我聽到賣花聲，我便担心伊那樣脆弱那樣嬌悄的音帶會迸斷，祈求伊暫時停唱的時候也常有。</p>
<p>如果那賣花聲忽然轉入另一個曲巷，被風吹得漸漸遠去，而音波逐漸由高而低的消失，這時候，我又會像失落了寳貝似的惆悵起來。體會那留剩在記憶裏的美好的音波。</p>
<p>這印象，直到現在，不容易把伊忘記。在上海，曾一度聽過南國劇社排演［蘇州夜話］裏的賣花女郎唐叔明小姐的賣花聲，伊提起花一般嬌嫩的語調唱着［淡淡長江水，悠悠遠客情！］的歌喉，我因此更熱情的感動了。現在唐小姐正飄泊在明珠與荔枝的南國，不知道伊的生活又是怎樣？</p>
<p>有一位詩人，曾寫過一雙聨語，是［沽酒店開風亦醉，］［賣花人過路猶香。］把賣花的寫得這樣媚人。</p>
<p>如今又是急景殘年，在城隍廟附，近滿擺着天竹臘梅，賣給都市的小姐太太們裝點，新歲的客室。雖然風雪裏也陣陣曼飄着香味，但比了［賣花聲在蘇州，］就覺得村俗難堪多了。</p>
<h3>梅雪競芳説蘇州</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>名伶梅晚華氏，應蘇地公益團體之請，來蘇演義務戲三日。偕梅來者，有名伶金少山，馬連良，名票錢志翔，孫蘭亭等；而海上聞人黄金榮氏，亦伴同來蘇。三日内雖雨雪紛飛，而上座之盛，實開蘇垣戲院空前之盛况，爰集花絮，付之春秋，讀者勿以明日黄花譏之也。</p>
<p>梅氏此次來蘇，爲蘇地公益盡義務，故當地官紳，爲酬答梅氏盛意，特於車站紮［歡迎梅蘭芳博士］匾額；並備紮花馬車十輛，爲各名伶入城代步。惟因此引起吳縣人力車同業公會之撚酸，竟於報端刋登抗議馬車進城之啓事，殊覺小題大做。</p>
<p>梅氏演劇，旣係爲公益盡義務；故服務於劇塲者，悉爲蘇垣當地官紳。鄒縣長監察售票，公安局長督察後臺，蘇州聞人劉正康氏，四輪車端坐要道，指揮院中一切事務，而張仲仁先生，亦擔任院門監守之責，熱心公益，良堪佩也。</p>
<p>三日中前往觀劇者，除當地人仕外，旅蘇之西人，前往定座，欣賞梅郎藝術者，爲數亦不下五六十人，梅之魔力，洵大矣哉！</p>
<p>觀劇所售之票，共分六種；最低之價，亦須二元，於是一般嗜梅之貧民，競擠於戲院門外，翹首引領，以俟梅王駕到。俾於馬車中一瞻顔色。是眞可謂［望梅止渴］矣。</p>

<h3>疚心</h3>
<p>— 了紅瘦鵑</p>
<p>他還記得，他獨自出遊的時候，却也不少。因爲此間這種富有詩意的景物，對於具有詩人眼光的他，太合脾胃，視線所及，，在在足以使他迷戀。於是每一度到來，就痴痴地作長時間的流連，直要等到悠悠的鐘聲，隨着微微的晚風，一聲聲，從那隐隐的一角紅牆中漏出來。他方始默默地，隨着天半薄薄晚霞下的陣陣歸鴉，緩緩歸去。</p>
<p>他迷戀這條路上的一草一木；一花一石，甚於小孩迷戀糖果。每次歸來，還是歡喜贊嘆，說；［這眞是人世的天堂；靈魂的樂園。白天遊倦了，枕邊的夢，也覺純潔而愉快。］</p>
<p>然而在未來之幕，不曾揭開以前，他夢裏也想不到，日後在這幽媚的仙鄕中，竟演成了上帝也無可如何的罪惡。</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>歐陽生已不願再想下去，因爲想下去祗有自愧。但思潮已不服從自主的强制，依舊是把往事搬映着。夜之幕，早籠罩了大地，黑暗中的他，却仍倚在柳樹上，醉一般的昏惘，想不到歸去。</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>他陶醉在東方生夫婦倆照拂的盛情中，四個多月了。他旣然欣羨着東方生的家，他又會自恨爲什麽得不到像東方夫人一樣天眞而活潑的伴侣。誠然，他的人生，以前是在後母權威下所支配着。他的父親是一個醉漢，每日在酒中過生活，那裏顧得到他婚姻問題上去，况且他自已尙無恒業，又不能和後母感情融洽，他每看到小曼和伊丈夫栽花種竹，學書問字，那得不使他感觸。雖是小曼始終像自已妹妹一樣不避嫌疑，但他痴想着；［小曼伊終於是人家的夫人呀！］</p>
<p>東方生最歡喜留連的一個去處，就是目前歐陽生身旁的激　一片小池塘。在這裏，可以釣魚；吟嘯，以至於一切游樂。離開東方的别墅，也祗有里許，有一條仄徑可以通行，兩旁除了兩行樹之外，盛開着野花，有一處還長着三四十竿細竹。他曾有一次高興着對歐陽生說；他願將來在此處離開人世，而下葬在山明水秀之鄕，方向無憾，因爲這裏畢竟離開都市祗有一二十里路，或許不久會繁盛起來，不能做他永久歸宿的墳墓，僅可以於此處把生命交還於上帝，留一個紀念。（十）</p>

<p>内地四七厦門五安慶五同行六○</p>

<h3>棉需停頓</h3>

<h3>内河冰斷米價提二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）内河冰凍到船僅一十號、兼之雪花紛飛、人心向上、市况大見起角、零銷城鄕店冐稍覺有些、　冐惟五六百石、以到少故、蘇同及常帮青角南港等帮浦積之貨、緊俏異常、價漲起二角、變　元亦見起色、杜洋尖仍無市、浦積不厚、若或内江冰凍、雪花繼飛、市况將不以歲暮有所曲折、定可有轉機之望、</p>
<p>（滬北）河下來源無幾、白粳店冐　貨　鈍、中段責化、次貨不惡、市形高由定立、次　尺外、薄粳早稻到銷兩和、形勢定格、羊尖到少銷活、價加四五角、杜尖埠尖亦堅尺外、　尖亦加一二角、白元到貨稀少、店冐應用需急、價陡漲六七角不一、</p>
<h3>標粉麥交稀市俏</h3>
<p>粉市呈堅穏之象、以洋來回好一二角、雖變化無幾人心則　見定、本月份結束在卽、家家空頭、仍有抵進、良因現粉缺乏、目均須照　準加價、自非補不可、遠期各月份、因　帮略有辦進、浮空亦有抵買、各盤成交、雖　寥寥、形勢則稍帶緊、以年關結束、多空了結居多、不過　馳不動、市氣遂見穏俏耳、結果本月份較前日收盤漲二八　、二月份漲二八六三月份漲一分二厘半、四月份漲二厘半、五六月份漲一分、</p>
<p>麥市人　呈穏象、本月份之成交、祇有一車、聞已　樣、是否交割、尙未可知、遠期因結束多空觀望、不過洋麥報價、微好一二角、行宗之套頭、亦未出　、人心稍見帶緊、結果本月份未開、二月份較前日好二分、三四月好二分、</p>
<h3>客秈交易漸見寥落</h3>
<p>丨洋米有成議可能丨</p>
<p>昨日客秈間化　活、行情微挺、惟貨主均有擯守王紅盤出售之意、高貨更無售出、到頭　見停止、後市似有步硬之象、得閩帮冐口亦不十分貧暢、價廉則略有閩　、價高則又停手觀望、且本　與其他各帮均無辦意、此後市　必日見清　、大約至陰　新正、方有發展之望也、昨日開出江西機晚九百包、價九元一角　八元九角、　機油二百包、價九元二角、　米電報合宜、團戶與軍　均有訂辦之撥洽、日内有成交之可能、惟行家爲前車之鑑、不敢自已問津云、</p>
<h3>黄豆豆油兩無榮辱</h3>
<p>昨日黄豆出口帮尙有拖進、故市形稍見砌高、貨主方面以年關結束、心意稍平、殊乏正式市價、計昨出口帮成交西城黄豆七百十　、崇明沙黄豆五百五十包、浦東杜豆祇由本街動間、昨成交一二百包、年内各貨、　無大變遷也、</p>
<p>油市尙帮穏定、蓋行家雖有回進、來源亦屬不斷、勢居兩敵、無甚榮辱也、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥團轉漲</h3>
<p>週二芝加哥小麥、因國外小麥生産情形欠佳、及西南區乏雨、某大戶補空而漲、又十六日成交共三千萬蒲歇爾、茲將十七日行市列左、</p>
<p>收盤價較前日</p>
<p>五月期四七·五○○漲○·六二五</p>
<p>七月期四七·六二五漲○·六二五</p>
<p>九月期四八·五○○漲○·六二五</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>馬口鐵定價又漲</h3>
<p>昨日大雪紛飛、五金市塲、十分冷落、各貨交易、又緣年關在邇、均呈凄凉之象、故全市除洋元及洋元頭·洋板及洋板頭有鉅大成交外、别貨寥少、惟海外周口鐵來重則有繼漲歡便士不等、如九十磅ＩＣＷ每箱十六先令八便士、雙連又三十四先令四便士、一百磅則每樣照花魚均高一先令五便士、聞昨日訂交有三千餘箱之多、查係二三月裝船之期貨云、</p>
<p>又據路透社十七日倫敦電、鋼略疲、錫　鋅均微漲、銻每噸仍爲十八鎊十先令、（中國貨）　十先令二便士、又紐約同日電、鋼價不更、仍爲五·○○</p>
<h3>東洋白鐵之鑑别法云·</h3>
<p>白鐵在我國市塲上流行者、有四種、英貨·美貨·比貨·日貨、其初銷路最繁者、爲英美貨、次爲比貨、又次則爲日貨、其後大阪金屬株式會社等工廠所出之白鐵甚多、來華推銷、以地域上之優勢、及其他種種原因、駸奪英美貨市塲而代之、自九一八後發生抵制以來、始稍稍减退、而仍有少數商人、祇知　利、不知雪恥、改頭換面私爲承銷、辨别乏術、得售其奸、良可浩嘆茲將東洋白鐵可行識别之處、略述於後、俾愛國商人知所取舍焉、</p>
<p>查日貨白鐵、多用捲裝、而以草繼裏扎、少平扎（扎、）故所售白鐵、多有　曲形、㈠日貨白鐵鍍鋅（卽白鉛）甚薄博、往往鍍不到之　甚多、所以花頭甚少光亮、色澤多暗、份量又輕、銹痕斑、每多劣跡、㈡　子字樣　　甚細、每捲除面上一張印有牌子外、此外均無、市上所流行者爲洋房·太陽·星月·三星·手火筆諸牌、亦有紅鳥慧星諸牌、惟字跡筆劃甚細、故尙易識别也、</p>

<h3>粗砂白升五分</h3>
<p>丨建　底缺　好丨</p>
<p>昨日糖市以走銷仍　、趨市平平、公會劃盤二四粗砂　初劃十五兩七錢半康盤後、以出戶寥寥、力轉緊勢、結果漲起五分、由昌興行開出一百包、價十五兩八錢、十八號二十號中砂白以及八九十號荷赤均乏成交、市價無甚上落、漳刁青昨建帮大章華號續開一百二十包、價九兩五錢半、建冰以到存均缺、號貨已相率不售、後市勢必轉緊、刁青漸青均有續到、暫時不致　開、蓋號客關意恩皆望春盤轉升也、</p>
<p>又據路透社十七日紐約電、現貨糖仍爲七角一分八七五、期貨一十二月不更、三月大二磅音、五七九月各大一磅音、又同日倫敦電、三月份續小一便士、爲四·一○·二五、五月小七五、爲四·二·七五、八月小一便士二五、爲　·二·二五、爪哇白糖不更、仍爲七·九、</p>
<h3>閘北貨蘭花子高貨軋缺</h3>
<p>行盤呌起三兩</p>
<p>蘭花子近以到貨寥寥、如本屆冬水所出全黄好貨、存底日見缺、市上僅、一家尙有存底、故行盤　起三兩許、　普通貨　存尙未開通、然劵不肯過　、預料春盤如銷路發動、定有善望云、</p>
<h3>泉泡圓到貨日稀</h3>
<p>泉州泡圓　來到頭漸稀、市勢亦轉平定、查號貨確已有限、大約均須俟春盤再行開兌、聞合安輪昨由泉續到一批、統共不及二百箱、</p>

<h3>瘋人（一）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>到底是小小的村莊，東村玉老四瘋癲的消息，在一早晨以内便傳遍全村了。這消息本來就很奇特，爲什麽一個這樣的奸人會突然瘋癲起來的呢？可是大家　説這是千眞萬確的；因爲這消息，是住在王老四隔壁的狗兒媽媽人消早在前村柳清　洗衣裳的時候，　先將這新聞告訴了大家。她是一個頂無是非的忠厚人，而且當時她眼眶喪還閃着乾　的淚光，所以這消息就很可靠了。那時村長家　的放牛的孩子二癩痢小子正在溝邊洗菜，一聽着這樣有味的新聞，便高興得什麽似的連跑帶跳的走了回來，菜籃也來不及放下，便高聲大驤道；［喂，王老四瘋了……。］於是這村長府上的上下人等立刻　知道了這一消息。就連此刻正　在大烟舖上的吳大爺也由吳太太的嘴裏知道了。</p>
<p>［唔？眞是……，王老四瘋了？］</p>
<p>吳大爺從嘴裏拔出烟槍來，忍着氣趁勢喝口熱荼，吐出餘咽，然後斜着眼情對吳太太　視一眼，有意無意的管應　，一面將鐵針在烟斗喪截了幾下，預備裝上第二個烟泡。其後，他再加上一句；</p>
<p>［可是他爲什麽會瘋了的呢］？</p>
<p>吳太太没有方法回答，而且　愧得很，這［爲什麽］，就連　自已也不知道。但是吳大爺旣是如此熱心，當然吳太太得去打聽明白。唯一的辦法只有喊住二　痢，因爲道句話是二癩痢傳來的。</p>
<p>［二癩痢，你可知道王老四爲什麽會瘋癩的？］</p>
<p>［這可不知道］。</p>
<p>［這句話不是你傳來的嗎？你爲什不知道］？</p>
<p>［是的，我是從狗兒媽媽那　　來的，她也没有説出病　來。據人説，也許是他自已移動緖欄的時候，驚動了山罡太歲也説不定］。</p>
<p>吳太太旣走到廚房中來了，當然大家　不大作聲，其後還是她説；</p>
<p>［哼，眞是料想不到，誰會知道他會瘋的呢？前天來　交欠租的時候，不還是好好的一個人嗎］？</p>
<p>［是的呀］，吳府上的賑房先生正在洗臉，這時候急忙抬起頭來，滿臉掛着水滴，頭髮上冒着白色的熱氣，笑着對吳太太説；［若不是大爺敎我攝逼着他要還欠租，到今天他瘋了，還　夠收得着嗎？］</p>
<p>［唔，可不是。不過吳老四的爲人到是不壞，從來就很安分守已，想不到會得下這樣的惡病］。</p>
<p>吳太太説着也就進房去了。二癩竱還聽着她嘴　唸着［阿彌陀佛］。（未完）</p>
<h3>學校與市塲</h3>
<p>— 俞宣</p>
<p>在資本主義社會裏，一切都商品化了，自然，敎育也不能例外。</p>
<p>Ｂａｒｔｅｒ的時代，早已過去，貨物必經市塲而後始能互相交易；Ｓｏｐｈｉｓｔ的精神，今亦已不復存在，敎育也必須有學校方可彼此授受。</p>
<p>不顧消費界的需要，只計利潤的累積，這是現代市塲的本質；不課程的功效，僅知按期收費，也正是目前所謂學校的特色。</p>
<p>店前遍貼着［環球貨品。一應俱全］的招帘，但是［無錢一便［莫想］；報上滿登着［設備完善，敎課認眞］的學校招生廣告，然而未繳費者不得入校］。這確是一個恰好的對照。</p>
<p>現在，金錢掌握了無上櫃威，侵據了一切人類活動的核心，有錢便［萬事順遂］，無錢就［一日難過］。因此，市塲固爲爭利之地，學校逐亦成爲生財之處，學生納費以獵取資格，敎師拿錢以糊口養家，敎者固不必諄諄，聽者尤照例藐藐，上下交相混，師生交互騙，交易而退，各得其所，市塲而已矣！學校云乎哉？自然，在資本主義社會裏的小百姓，厚本只有跑腿和餓肚的自山。然而跑腿猶可，餓肚則有點難受。若何而後可以不餓肚？其惟［找錢］乎。找錢之法多端，自賣淫以至做官，皆是也。有甚麽貨，開甚麽店，當然也是生財之大道，於是而學校林立矣，再於是而敎育發達矣！這樣，學校之成爲市塲，固亦勢所必至，理所當然，又烏足怪？</p>
<p>這裏，我並不是説敎育是清高神聖的事業，應超越時空而獨立，而是證明敎育只是某一經濟基礎所搆成的上層建築，它是隨着經濟基礎的變遷而變遷而變遷的。科舉與學校，不過是兩個不同時代的意識之反映的産物。故現今學校之市塲化，亦自爲資本主義社會裏所必然發生的現象。</p>
<p>根本的改革，不在於所謂敎育的方案和學校的體制，而在於現社會整個經濟組織之變革。</p>
<p>眞正的完善的學校，只有在合理的社會制度下方能成立！</p>
<h3>爐邊獨語</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>偶然翻開王仲瞿烟霞萬古樓集，看見了一首他示三歲兒子善才的詩，覺得有趣之至，抄在下面。</p>
<p>善才生二十五月矣，計識得二百五十餘字，示以詩云；</p>
<p>阿爺四歲識千字，一一形書曉其義，兒今三歲字二百，他日爲立定奇特。人間識字天上嗤，阿爺自誤還誤兒，兒莫學阿爺！知書娘道好，空今餓死無人保，夷齊廟　　香烟，維摔　　到鬥禱？阿爺配食兩應去，賴爾鬥庭來洒　。泰皇燒書黑如炭，豫讓呑之不當飯，魚鹽作相盜作將，天下功名在　販。兒不聞，倉頡作字鬼神哭，從此文人倉氣栗。又不聞，軒轅黄帝不用一字　，風后力牧爲公卿。</p>
<p>王仲瞿奇才不遇，詩像是太史公的文章。曾在杭州武林鬥外兩馬勝之間和夫人金秋紅結王庵偕隠，現在已經没有人曉得這王庵的遺址了。友人陳　荷爲他譔過年譜，但因材料不多，中途廢止。每談到［江東餘子老王郎，來抱琵琶哭大王］之句，還是慷慨激昂，説總有一天要把這王仲瞿的年譜編成。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>悲哀之詞易工，也是自然之勢。因爲人的感情，快活的時候，是弛故的，悲哀的時候，是緊張的。子食於喪者之側，未嘗飽也，悲哀的感染，比快樂當然更來得速而且切。李後主亡國之後的詞，簡直是一字一涙，無論何人讀了，也不得不爲他腸斷　比起前期［花明月暗龍輕霧］來，自然是［多恨昨夜夢魂中］好得多了。還有欣當文學的心景，中國人與外國人似乎稍微有黠不同。外國人就文論文，似乎以傾向於藝術　上主義者爲多。　如外國人讀貝倫，　來之詩，對於詩人們的亂倫悖德的私行，完全置之　外。而中國人則當　到文天祥，岳武穆的詩歌的時　，首先想起的，印是這些作者的人格的背景。從這一方面説來，又是悲劇比喜劇更容易成功的一　秘訣。嚴分宜，阮人　，詩並非不佳，然而没有人去讀，就因爲他們的人格　汚，不能搆成悲壯美的背景的緣故。</p>
<h3>文學上的婦女解放</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>無疑義的，任何時代的文學都與同一時代的實生活發生密切的聨繫，所以近日年來洶湧澎湃的婦女解放運動，在文學上也就自着明顯的反映了。在男子佔著絕對優勢的封建社會中，經濟的全部全爲他們所佔領，於是處於附屬品的地位中的女性便不能不對男子盡着奴隸一般的忠心而換取他們麵包的供給，所以，對於宿娼或和人通姦的丈夫要守貞操，所有的欺騙和壓迫，都得委屈忍受。然而當時也不是全無反　響的，譬如易卜生的［傀儡家庭］便是文學上的例證。同時代還有［羣鬼］［海上夫人］，也談到了婦女解放問題。繼後又有了蕭伯納的［華倫夫人之職業］，這對於婦女們的覺醒，總算是有剌激性的。那末爲了獲得人格的獨立而從［我的心肝，我的小鳥兒］的甜蜜的呼聲之下决然出走的娜拉究竟能夠走到那裏去呢？是否能夠獨立生活呢？［華倫夫人之職業］中的薇薇似乎解答了這一問題。她不能同意她母親華倫夫人的見解；［……好人家的女孩允敎養大了，除了去求一個富翁的賞識，嫁給他，享用他的家財之外，還幹什麽事？……］［我們所有的東西就是我們的面貌和奉待男人的本領……］而她所能回答母親的却是［…</p>
<p>…人人都有選擇職業的機會……隨着自已的嗜好，選擇檢　布或是賣花……如果她們找不着現存的，她們就待自已創造］。當然，薇薇確是比娜拉進步了。　　這樣，她們使衝破了男性用偏見所築成的堡壘，打入了辦公廳，叩開了工廠的大門，和男子同樣的過着獨立生活了。正如科侖泰在［新婦女］中告訴我們；［我們可以看到這些獨身婦人在工作檯上執行研究所的實騐，在圖書館裏整理材料，在病院裏從事劇烈的職務。］</p>
<p>但是，在一般的資本主義國家中，大多數的婦女們正在做着與男子同樣的工作，却不能得着與男子同樣的酬勞，而且不能逃出家庭的囹圄，所以她們正希望有一個更好的社會，這在　並脫曼的［女工馬立台］，高爾基的［漂泊者的日記］中都表現出來了。</p>
<p>至於新社會中的新女性，她們完全在舊有的一切桎梏中解放出來，這在新俄的文學作品中可以找着許多例證，她們完全在文學上表現出眞實的自由了。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>［到那個公園去？］</p>
<p>［到虹口公園去好麽？］</p>
<p>她微求他的同意。到虹口公園去，要在日大人的勢方圈内走過，要走日本陸戰隊的司令部面前走過，要看見那些眼睛發着猛獸般的兇光的日本水兵，要看見那些準備殺中國人的兇器鐵甲車，同時聨想那天夜衷看見日本巡捕之兇毆中國車夫他實在不願意到虹口那一帶的地方去。</p>
<p>他躊躇着一時不答應。</p>
<p>［你不喜歡到虹口公園去？我也不願意去的。不過，想順便到那頭去買點禮物給他們帶回］</p>
<p>日本去。</p>
<p>［到梵王渡公園去不好麽？那邊才像個公園］</p>
<p>［也好。那麽明天再替他們去買吧。］</p>
<p>［他們眞個就要回日本去？］</p>
<p>［不回去，在這　做什麽？誰養他們？……那個小了頭或者留在我們這裏多住一月半月，等到找着了職業。……］</p>
<p>［她來上海找職業的？］</p>
<p>聽見單那　日本佬回去，那個美麗的日本姑娘仍然可以留在這衷，這又似乎適合了他所希望。他想，那麽在曾先生未回來之前，每天是兩個美人陪着自已吃飯了。</p>
<p>從郵局出來，原想趁公共汽車到靜安寺路底，再由靜安寺　底轉搭無軌電車到梵王渡公園。他並没有想到鶴子夫人竟那樣地布爾喬亞化了。她執意　自僱小汽車。她雖然説要由她付車資，但海泉不好意思　她慢慢地解開她手提皮篋。男子做事無論如何比女子做事敏捷。大槪也是他不願意給鶴子夫人懷疑他是一個咅嗇的人。他終於先付出了一塊五角大洋。</p>
<p>［比坐電車或公共汽車貴四倍的價錢啊！］</p>
<p>他付了錢後，這樣想。</p>
<p>［……今天籌應和她她出來，未免太笨了。未見利，先見害。］</p>
<p>但是在汽車裏的柔軟的墊褥上和她並着肩坐下來，覺很又有一種説不出來的舒服和愉快。汽車每振動一次，她的肩頭便會碰着他的肩角。這雖然是隔着重重要衣服，他也像能感着一種熱流般。到後來，他竟有點恨租界内的馬路太平坦了。</p>
<p>他無意中伸出手來，指了指染在他的大衣角上的　灰。</p>

<h3>足勝於手</h3>
<p>— 孫源</p>
<p>雖然我是在讀新聞學，可是新聞書籍，一學期以來，没有翻過一翻，（這是好學生，）今天因爲要考試了，爲學分起見才從書架上拿下一本新聞學書來，拂去了灰塵拿來翻一翻，翻開書來，裏面有一條做訪員的信條是［足勝於手］，大意是採訪新聞，除靠手寫稿外，最重要的是足的奔［走］，</p>
<p>我覺得這不僅是當新聞記者，應當信奉遵守的信條，倒也是一般人處世的秘訣，成功的捷徑，譬如説你認識了一位黨國要人，學者名流，經理買辦，不妨多去走走，拍拍馬屁，又如學校裏運動選舉，什麽自治會的委員，也得走訪走訪，同郷的同學們，終比貼標語來得有把握。</p>
<p>這種例子多哩，上面二個是信手拈來的，</p>
<p>總而言之，統而言之，對於你有利益的人不論他是王八羔子，漢奸，國賊，土豪劣紳，惡棍學閥……，這一切都不必管，只要他有利於你，不妨多去。走走，不要怕聽他家門房老爺的　囌或怕着聽差大人的白眼，你終得去走走終，是好的。有利的。</p>
<p>所以我以爲［足勝於手］不但是我們學新聞學的人念念不忘，時時刻刻記在心上的信條，這也一般人處世接物的秘訣，這是在下學新聞學的研究所得，惟不敢秘之傳給十八代的子孫預備將來當十八代祖傳的秘方賣，故特公開在此，以作有心［做官］［發財］的朋友們的參考。</p>

<h3>簡易之牛乳中防腐劑檢查法</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>見本刋載之［談談牛乳］一篇，頗有益於讀者；而牛乳中（無論新鮮或其他種類）加入防腐劑，確爲極普通之事。要知牛乳中之任何保存劑，有害無益，今特草就此篇以供　者。</p>
<p>牛乳　之防腐劑，普　　福買林。ｒｍａｌｉｎ，小蘇打，柳酸，　酸，雙氱水，及重鉻酸鉀等，</p>
<p>福買林此物多加於新鮮之牛乳中。以五西西之新鮮牛乳，加二西西之Ｐｈｌｏｒｏｇｌｕｏｉｎｅ之一千倍之稀淡溶液；用力振盪之後，再加二西西之輕　化鈉若該牛乳中含有福買林者，即呈有彩之赤赭色。若無則作青白色。此法甚靈騐，即使福買林稀淡至一○○○，○○○倍牛乳中，亦能檢得之。</p>
<p>小蘇打以二十西西新鮮牛乳或十克之煉乳，蒸發至乾（用乳粉者可無須行此手續），繼用强熱燒之，至有機物盡爲養化，祗剩白色殘渣爲止。用水溶化殘渣，再加晦苔試液數滴，若變成藍色，可證明有蘇打或其他鹹牲物，但鹹性物中，用作防腐劑者祗小蘇打一種。欲知其量，可用硫酸滴至無色，再乘以○·○四二·即得。</p>
<p>柳酸柳酸又名水楊酸，此物爲防腐劑中，最有害者。以五十西西牛乳加五十西西之酸性硫酸鉀及五西西之酒精（九五）即得一沉澱，過濾以除之，將濾液加五十西困哼Ｂｅｎｚｅｎｅ，置一分液漏斗中搖盪後，靜置一邊待二液分開，除去水層，傾出困哼液而蒸發之。若該乳中含有柳酸者，加五西西中性　化高鐵，即待紫紅色。</p>
<p>酸一以牛乳或乳粉加熱水後，過濾之，取其濾液置一分液漏斗中，加醚Ｅｔｈｅｒ搖之，則醚能將脂肪體吸取。將水層分開後，置一蒸發皿中，用熱蒸發至乾，再以强熱燒去有機物質。將所剩之灰分加等量之甲烷硫酸鉀ＰｏｔａｓｓｉｕｍＭｅｔｈｙｌＳｕｌｐｈａｔｅ，混和後，置一乾燥試管中燒之。若有　酸，所發之氣體，着火作美麗之綠色。</p>
<p>雙養水此物如福買林之多加於新鮮牛乳中。以牛乳五西西加以數滴瘉瘡木　，若該牛乳含有雙氯水，即得赭紅色。</p>
<p>重　酸鉀此物爲黄色，多加於乳粉及煉乳中，故不看出。可將牛乳粉或煉乳，用强熱燒去有機物，所剩之灰分作黄色者即爲有重　酸　之證。若含量小，灰分中不能見，乃以水洗之，並加二西西之淡硫酸（溶於十倍水中之淡硫酸）及二滴雙養水；最後置一分液漏斗中，加醚十西西而搖之，若醚變成藍色，即有重鉻酸　之證。</p>
<h3>雪的游戲</h3>
<p>— 島生</p>
<p>丨丨中學生活之一幕丨丨</p>
<p>早晨起來，推窗一望，但見滿地壓着厚厚的一層雪，白皚皚一片銀的世界。西北風還在呼呼地怒號，雪却停止了不飄，天上還密段着彤雲，毫無一點暖意。</p>
<p>這天恰巧是星期日，没有課業，離開大考也還遠。這樣積　前天氣，已到了滴水成冰的程度，可是這雪天，在年青的中學生看來，並不是怎樣冷得難過的日子。所以，早餐後，年青的人一個個從温暖的書齋中走出來，不約而同的踏着雪·四散在院子裏玩着雪的游戲丨丨雪團戰，推雪人。</p>
<p>年青的人，誰都富有好奇心和冒險心對於一切事物，都感覺得好玩而有興趣。在四十多歲的舍監先生，以及幾位年老的敎授們看來，這般在雪地裏拿雪做玩具的青年學子，簡直是瘋狂者，或是一羣蠢豕。雖有堆雪人，雪戰的結果，將使每個青年的手凍得通紅，兩頰變做蘋果，然而年青的人所感覺到的是有味，是快樂。</p>
<p>大約有二畝大小的長方形院子裏，東一簇西一簇的有百數個青年學子。堆雪人的大都是女同學，她們三個一羣四個一起的，在枯花樹旁，屋簷下以及較爲僻靜之，地努力地堆積起雪來，替敎職員們造像，或堆成佛像。也有幾個平素有藝術家雅號的男同學，拿雪堆權做石膏，用竹片輕輕雕刻，實行雕塑練習。其餘的全是雪團戰中的戰士，我也是一員。所謂雪團戰者，並没有整齊的陣線，也没有一定的敵人，子彈便是揑結實的雪團。大家亂紛紛的你打我，我擲他的，白色的球形物滿天飛舞，煞是有趣，中間還雜有勝利者歡呼聲，被創者的詬駡聲，閙成一片。</p>
<p>我給小李打中了好幾下，有一下打在臉上，隐隐作痛。我雖然恨極，但也没法，任你瞄得準，他那猴子似的靈活身叚避讓得妙，總給你擲個空。一次，</p>
<p>只顧趕他没有注意到石榴樹旁一個女神造像，給我撞脫掉頭顱，忽地斜剌裏跳出一個老王來阻住去路。大聲向我説道；［小張！這次不能饒你，快賠給我］；我眼見得那女神的頭顱已跌得鼻塌嘴歪不成樣了，於是，只得　脫了老王的手，一溜烟似逃走了，態度是非常地狼狽。然而小李還不饒我，見了我的狼狽情景，他反躡手躡脚的緊隨背後，待到返身再趕時，只見他一揚手，我早又着了個正，在右腿上。氣得要命，在地上抓了一把雪用力丢去，那知這一下不打緊，闖了更大的禍了。旣没有打中小李，反不偏不倚的打在正堆佛的萍女士的腦袋上，把萍女士富有藝術意味的一頭青絲，頓時變成白髮。我只得在萍女士怒目監視之下走向前去，像一個犯人走到法官面前自首的樣兒。先賠一個笑臉，立正，然後再行軍禮道歉。我説，［對不住！小姐！願受你最嚴厲的處罰］。惡作劇的她，竟乘我不作整備之際，把一雙濕淋淋冰冷冷的手塞在我頸裏，冷得我直呌起來。小李却在遠遠的唱道；　　［千不該，萬不該，小張的雪團　中了萍小姐的腦袋。……］了</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>這是三年前的事了，那時我在江灣ⅩⅩ中學讀書。近來，我不但失了學，而且還是失業洪流中的一員，青年氣息，磨滅殆盡。在嚴寒氣候的壓迫下，枯坐在亭子樓中，望着外面雪花飛舞，不禁股憟！回想往事，悽然神往！</p>
<h3>態度泰然三海関怎麽又要　把戲了</h3>
<h3>出賣肉感</h3>
<p>— 羣</p>
<p>對小老婆的朋友説，［不專有　　］無　爲大·］玩女人的朋友説；［食色性也。］國人對於解决性的問題最如此自騙騙人的·在此人慾　流的現時代·想發財的朋友　進利用以［色］講人·比買跑馬票實惠。手段高嫂的，跑碼頭，引誘委色較佳的婦女販條子。他們開一次碼頭，大可以逍遙一時。各碼頭也有聨絡的人肉機關，就收買這些還不知自已上了圈套的可憐女子，威　她們出賣皮肉，供他們的私壑。日復一日，年復一年，大都市中的賣性交易，比無論什麽事實進展得快，公共機關之外，還有私家公司。小家碧玉，大家閨秀，都想投機撈撈外快，祇要有識途老馬，儘可作入幕之賓。但是時代已由一九三三轉進一九三三，討小老婆，玩女人的朋友　雖然照舊討小老婆，玩女人。不過他、</p>
<p>已討的小老婆和已玩的女人，却不能隨便的進機關，公司生財有道了。時代告訴你們，男人已經佔有你們了，除非跑進一次大律師事務所，不然法律將要裁判你們（在雜誌上看見某小島的新刑法有夫之婦丨不知小老婆在此例否？丨背夫有私行者，法律亦處以徒刑）於是一九三三的新賣買，是［出賣肉感。］君不見影戲院的廣告上，不論是一張什麽片子，都可以堆上香豔，肉感，消沉，澈骨，……字句，誘惑討小老婆和玩女人的朋友性慾衝動，而以雪白的大洋鈿，滾進老板的私囊。要知道［肉感］，不過把你尊體的輪廓，明顯的表演出表，借給　涎欲滴朋友，像隔靴招癢一般的賞鑑一下。與你們旣没有名譽及身體上的損失，而雪白的中山袁頭，都可滾進袋裏。但是最好進什麽歌舞團去訓練幾個月，修改自已的弱點，如臀部太小等。利用自已的特點，如輕擺柳腰等。如此以後。祇要到公共塲所去，提一提手，蹺一蹺腿　馬上有色情狂的朋友，像爺娘似的孝敬你。而且比較正色捐了花捐，掛上牌子，舖了房間的魔力，有過之，無不及。如此四美俱，二難併，出賣［肉感］同志，盍興乎來？</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>昨天老友余君，來講起一個後母虐待女孩兒的事實；聽了令人髮指，特照錄於下，怕也會博得先生的同情，那未請你指未一個解放的途徑罷。（以下是余君的談話）</p>
<p>［我的鄰居姓王，他有一個女孩兒；名呌阿金，今年才九歲，六歲的時候，老天就奪去了她的慈母，不到一年，就有一個三十左右的婦人，來做她的後母；從此就没有一天好日子過了］。</p>
<p>［天還没有亮足的時候，就起身了，汲水，燒水，掃地，燒粥，以及服待她後母起身，是日常的工作，並且這位後母的架子，非常十足丨連茶水都要送到手中的丨有時茶水太冷了，或太熱了，就要説不願意做，有意搗蛋，輕則臭駡，重則毒打，］</p>
<p>［早晨的公事完畢，就去買小菜，等到回家的時候，没有一天不生問題的丨東西不好啦，價錢太貴啦，在外偷閒啦，於中揩油啦丨枝枝節節的閙個不休］。</p>
<p>［下午就要漿洗衣服；不是今天説洗的不乾凈，便是明天説肥皂太狼費，］</p>
<p>［總而言之，事無大小，不論這九歲的女孩能不能夠擔任，都得要她做的，結果，却除了殘羹冷飯以及打駡以外，休想有她的份兒，］</p>
<p>［她父親出門在外，每年回來一二次；聽了這長舌婦的搬弄，不免也來上一個帮凶，以博玉皇大帝的歡喜，可憐阿金的身上，就此没有完好的所在了！］（下略）</p>
<h3>鍾炳章敬叩</h3>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>編者按；人自出生以後，就有受法律保障的權益·所以一個人的生命健康·任何人（連生身父母在内）加以妨害的時候，可以要求法庭保障·阿金的處境·雖然不致直接妨害生命，但可信將妨害及其健康，所以她的母系親族她如外祖母舅等丨可以搜集了證件，（人證物證均好）要求領去代爲撫養，至於撫養的費用，可責其父親負擔；這是他不容易推却的義務，不過不可要求太大，出乎她父親經濟力的範圍罷了，</p>
<p>上面不過是解决王阿金個人的辦法，至於後母之在我國家庭裏，能夠相安無事的，竟十不得一，後母虐待子女的，固屬不少，但子女捉弄後母的，也未始没有，並且一個男子，中年喪偶，遺下許多未成年的子女，也是非續娶不辦；所以後母之在中國社會，就成爲値得研究的問題了，希望讀者們各就所知，將這問題的各方面，如父親，後母，女子，前妻親戚，後妻親戚，以及不相干的親鄰，或好或歹的事實，傁量來發表，我們於每個事實之後，當加以評論；並且最後希望找出一個結論來。</p>

<h3>大飯店攝製經過</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>（上）戈爾定的外交手腕</p>
<p>大飯店ＧｒａｎｄＨｏｔｅｌ係米曲羅公一九三二年的傑構，現在已經到上海了。聽説將於二月初在國泰開映，現在先介紹些牠的故事</p>
<p>假使你是個飯店的經理，一天有個興怱怱的書記跑來告訴你葛雷泰嘉寳，瓊克勞馥，華萊斯皮萊，里昂巴里穆亞和約翰巴里穆亞同時來登記，你能給誰最華麗的房間，最週到的招待和最多的注意？</p>
<p>這就是戈爾定ＥｄｍｕｎｄＧｏｕｌｄｉｎｇ當他拿了傳聲器在米高梅公司預備拍［大飯店］的時候，所處的困難情形。</p>
<p>戈爾定對自已忖度著；［他們應當得到一樣性質的房間，一樣的招待和一樣的注意。］</p>
<p>這張片預備拍的時候，外面謠言很多，有人説葛雷泰嘉寳對於做舞女一角，不十分滿意。華萊斯皮萊不願做那忙碌的巨人的一角，並且有人説，這張片子將來祗不過用來襯修接間的地板罷了，（卽抛在地板上。）</p>
<p>但片子開拍的時候，空氣又呈緊張了。每一個主要演員都準備着，在最重要的部分，最重要的幾景内，一顯其身手。</p>
<p>戈爾定非但能導演，並且能運用外交手腕，使這不分軒輊的五分，成同樣地重要。這樣使他們覺得他一無徇私和偏愛。假使片中須映出某人的頭或某人的腿，那末一定要這樣做，不管明星的意見是怎樣。</p>
<p>這些明星雖都很有名，但當這影片開拍時，他們並不都認議，祗有嘉　和里昂巴里穆亞在奈何天中曾合演過一次。</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>嘉寳和約翰巴里穆亞合演似乎很快樂。約翰和她合演，也覺得有趣。她久已讚美約翰演劇的天才，所以他們的認識更加增加興趣。</p>
<p>許多攝影塲的工人亦説，她從來没有工作得這樣地勤力的。</p>
<p>［據我所知這是第一次，］裏面有一個人這樣説。［她在開攝大飯店］的以前，從没有參加過預演。但她對於她表演的一角終能非常正確地記在心頭，這是難能可貴的。</p>
<p>［大飯店］開拍，後自始至終的所以能這樣平靜無爭執，大部份的功勞要歸之於導演戈爾定君，因爲他深知並且能利用他們各明星的個性，卽就一件事來講，在攝影的過程中，祇有他一個人敢用［葛雷泰］來呼嘉寳，並且有人説他曾很安間，很熱誠地呌過她［Ｄｅａｒ的。</p>
<p>因爲實際上大都人都很正式地呌嘉寳做［嘉寳小姐，］究竟戈爾定給她這樣親熱的稱呼，她喜歡不喜歡祗有嘉寳知道，但無論如何，她對於這點並没有提起什麽反感。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評東北義勇軍浴血戰史</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在東北義勇軍單衣赤足苦戰於冰天雪地，而關内的後方民衆正在圍爐取暖的當中，這一部悲哀壯烈的影片能夠在我們面前開映，我想對於我們這般［準亡國奴］該是十分剌激的吧？尤其是在這肉感與戀愛的上海電影空氣中，這一影片確是具有新的意義。</p>
<p>這是一部［資料影片］，其中没有Ｓｔｏｒｙ的結構，更没一般所不能缺少的［戀愛］的穿挿，所以對於那些公子哥兒們也許星不大適合口味的。它完全是戰地寫實，將帝國主義的猙獰面目，將義勇軍的堅苦奮鬥，有系統的顯示在我們面前，雖然在編輯法方面還有多少不能盡如人意的地方，可是就兩軍的［對比］來説，也顯得很有力量。雖然少有直接肉搏的塲面，但是因爲戰地攝影的冒險和困難，我們應當佩服九星公司的同人們的勇敢精神。但是過於着重了民族英雄，没有注意東北民衆的力量，這不能不算是很大的缺點。其次對於義軍不免有意的誇大，這似乎有着自驕輕敵的毛病。再則敵軍的殘暴也不能更多的描寫，這或許是因爲事實的不許可。鏡頭不免呆笨。光線清晣。字幕增加了敎育力</p>
<h3>蘇聨著名導演家攝製有聲滑稽片</h3>
<p>— 拾</p>
<p>蘇聨著名電影導演家愛生斯坦，現開始攝製一重要之有聲滑稽片，同時愛氏着手攝一名［黑領事］之影片，以法國大革命爲題材云。</p>
<p>量不少。但是在目前能夠有這樣的一部新的别開生面的影片，我們對於技巧又何必過於苛求呢？</p>
<p>總之，這是一部好的片子，假如在意義上能夠更爲正確的話。我們在這中間可以看敵軍仗着犀利的兵器而放肆屠殺，我們看到義軍的爲民族而奮鬥的精神，我們可以看到那種彈盡援絕的情形，因而覺醒自已對於義軍的責任。</p>
<p>最後，我希望上海的每一電影院，都能夠以最低的票價而特别開映這一影片，在喚醒民衆，擴大民族戰爭的任務上是應該如此的。同時在開映這一影片的時候，切不可雜以其他無意義的一切短片，以免淆亂觀衆的心情，而且在開映之前助以有力的悲壯的音樂或其他有同樣意義的短片，以增加本片的力量。</p>

<h3>胡蝶將入天一公司</h3>
<p>— 青霞</p>
<p>胡蝶和明星公司的合同，不久卽將滿期；天一邵醉翁得到這個消息，嘗數度與之接洽，重金要求她加入拍戲。她以爲天一所許之薪金，較明星約多三分之一，故已表示允意。聞在本年三月間完成明星鏡頭後，卽可現諸事實。</p>
<h3>黎明暉在天一</h3>
<p>天一公司預備在［孽海雙鴛］完竣後，卽開抽由黎明暉主演的［追求；］所以近來她起勁在研究表演。不過在她的合同裏，還有這樣的一條；［……與黎配演之男角，由其本人自由指定，公司無權主使。……］所以和她配演的男角究屬是誰，還在不可知之數。</p>
<h3>［天明］開映有期</h3>

<p>意見陳述</p>
<h3>談談獸片</h3>
<p>— 玉侖</p>
<p>本刋十五日所登載某君從大陸報譯來消息，謂去年本埠電影觀衆，認爲最佳的影片是；㈠同心结，㈡人猿泰山，㈢紅樓艶史，㈣科學怪人，㈤龍虎鬭。依照這次結果，可以説本埠人士近來是歡喜看獸片了。</p>
<p>兒童們天生就喜歡看自然界生活的影片，而近來則成人亦有這種趨向，原因是人們都有好奇心，但我以爲還有兩個原故，</p>
<p>人和獸的區别，一個是有衣冠，一個是無衣冠，然而社會上有許多衣冠禽獸，整天的過着爾虞我詐的生活，相見時都帶着假面具；這樣反不如禽獸的率眞了。衣冠禽獸的生活過得太苦悶了，實在羨慕率眞的生活，所以喜歡看獸片。</p>
<p>還有一個原因就是獸片裏兩獸相遇，是各盡其能的奮鬭；即使牛遇着老虎，也要鬥箇明白，没有不抵抗的，而原野的人類，也從奮鬥中生存，我們中國人，見外侮日亟，而國内尙有些不抵抗的將領，太氣憤了，所以看獸類的抵抗，以慰情於無聊，</p>
<p>我對於玉崙君的見解極表同情。編者不敏附註。</p>

<p>— 希孟譯</p>
<p>等到諸事辦完，正要到慕爾娜那裏去的時候，慕爾娜的電報亦來了；</p>
<p>瑞典斯都克霍姆保羅克魯爾鑒；余已與美國影片公司訂立合同。星期六日自勃離末爾啟程赴好萊塢。此係余畢生機會，希加以原諒愛，慕爾娜。</p>
<p>保羅眼瞪瞪地看了那封電報，瞼上充滿了失望。不知他有没有工夫趕到勃離末爾同慕爾娜話别？</p>
<p>不興。董事會召集了緊急會議，討論一件重大事項，就是有一筆大借欵到期了，無法續訂。保羅必須設法籌欵，而那時紐約交易所正在停止交易之中，形勢十分危急。保羅請了愛立克來。</p>
<p>［你這回怎麽樣呢？］愛立克顯然無可奈何的神氣説。</p>
<p>［我們公司的大槪情形，你能趕快地查一查，報告我嗎？］</p>
<p>［是的，我今天早晨已經吩咐會計課課長趕緊造了一個簡單的報告。］他跑到保險櫃前面，開了保險櫃，取出一張紙，讀著；［世界上欠你錢的有四十國；你在火柴一種事業上操縱資産的總數約在一兆二萬金元以土，别的事業槪不在其内；你每年出産的火柴共三十兆盒；你在歐洲南美北美及亞洲四十三國之中共有火柴廠二百五十家；但是…］愛立克的聲音很奇怪的低了下去，［現在世界各國經濟感受恐慌之中，没有一個地方，可以將這張報告　抵押一文錢的！］</p>

<p>愛立克出去以後的那一回兒保羅的神筋受了極度的剌激，緊漲得幾乎爆裂了。他從抽屣喪抽出慕爾娜的相片來，但是他兩眼昏花，看得一眼白雪茫茫，他的嘴唇，上下震動。他怱然見喊了一聲，將慕爾娜的相片，塞在抽屣喪，站了起來，跑到一個秘密保險櫃的前面。他開了保險繼，拿出一本小黑簿子來，怱怱地　著。忽然翻到一頁，上面寫着；（未完）對</p>

<p>Mediation of the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Attempts a Final Effort</h3>
<p>Report to be drafted in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Tokyo Reply Insists on Rejecting US and Russian Participation</p>
<p>Japanese representatives engage in separate activities seeking understanding from major powers.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen held a closed-door meeting again this afternoon. After three hours of intense debate, it was decided to telegraph the Japanese government to ask whether, apart from the invitation to the United States and Russia, the draft resolution could be accepted in its entirety, and requested a clear response before Friday. (Central News Agency telegram, Geneva, 2:37 AM)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's reply regarding the Committee of Nineteen was sent out today. The reply refuses to acknowledge the discussion of "Manchukuo" and rejects the participation of non-member states in mediation. It is widely believed that the Committee of Nineteen will abandon mediation. Therefore, the League of Nations Assembly must draft a report, which is expected to endorse the Lytton Report. (Reuters telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the Committee of Nineteen meets at 4 PM today, it is expected to acknowledge that its efforts to find a basis for Sino-Japanese compromise have failed. It is anticipated that the committee will reject Japan's proposals, so it must draft a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, stating all the facts of the dispute and providing recommendations. However, the method of proceeding seems yet to be decided. Currently, there are approximately three paths: (1) The Committee of Nineteen could hold a public meeting, formally announce the full text of the original draft resolution, and then allow Chinese and Japanese representatives to express their views in public; (2) The Committee of Nineteen could convene another meeting soon, allowing Chinese and Japanese representatives to express their views in public, and then proceed to draft the report; (3) The Committee of Nineteen will immediately proceed to draft the report, which is expected to take a long time. If the third strategy is adopted, it is expected that the League of Nations Secretariat will issue a report in the so-called "Drummond style." Although the reasons for this report are extremely weak, it will summarize the League of Nations' activities regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute over the past sixteen months, and cite the facts from the Lytton Commission's report. It is also heard that many small countries are preparing to draft their own report for consideration by the Committee of Nineteen, which will clearly condemn Japan for violating Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant. (Note: Article 10 of the Covenant stipulates that members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.) (Guomin News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' mediation efforts in the Sino-Japanese dispute have now reached a critical juncture. Drummond's recent bizarre contacts with the Japanese side have been widely criticized. Since Germany's demand for military equality, France has been determined to maintain the League of Nations' strength. British Foreign Secretary Simon's pro-Japanese attitude is also not supported by public opinion in his own country, and the MacDonald government has been adversely affected as a result. Furthermore, the Japanese army's invasion of Shanhaiguan has damaged British interests in North China. At the same time, the United States has expressed extreme impatience with the League of Nations' delayed policy. Under these circumstances, the Committee of Nineteen is poised to take steps to draft a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. It is heard that a draft of this report is already under discussion. Our representative, Gu, told the newly elected Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, that the aforementioned report must state that Japan has violated the League of Nations Covenant, which is an indispensable condition. Representative Guo visited Simon last night to inquire about the British government's attitude. (Central News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's reply was informally delivered to the Chairman of the Special Committee, Hymans, Secretary-General Drummond, British representative Simon, and French representative Massigli last night. The official text of the reply was delivered to Hymans this morning. Japan has accepted the draft proposal discussed between Drummond and Sugimura, except for one point. However, it is highly doubtful whether first, the Committee of Nineteen is willing to endorse this proposal, and second, whether China is willing to accept this amendment. The point that Japan has not accepted is the matter of inviting non-League of Nations member states to participate. This matter involves principles and procedures, and was originally a matter to be dealt with in the League of Nations Covenant. There is some doubt as to whether it is appropriate to seek a solution outside the League of Nations. However, this move was initiated by Britain, and the League of Nations Assembly also warmly welcomes it, so the Committee of Nineteen may disregard Japan's opposition. As for the issue of compromise, it was discussed at the Committee meeting on Monday. Therefore, a proposal may be put forward today, because Japan's amendments to the draft proposal, like China's amendments, have now been submitted to the meeting. Drummond will provide strong assistance to Japan's amendments, representing those whom he represents. However, one thing cannot be ignored: there is a strong feeling that mediation procedures have undoubtedly failed. Organizing a mediation committee now is just prolonging the hardship for several more months. It is expected that those countries holding this view will advocate a decisive resolution this afternoon, abandoning mediation procedures and proceeding with the provisions of Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. If so, it will inevitably lead to the convening of the League of Nations Assembly. However, the League of Nations Assembly may not be easily convened until the beginning of next month. (Reuters telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, important figures are coming and going incessantly, attempting a last five-minute effort to revive the dying mediation. The most noteworthy events are the meetings between British Foreign Secretary Simon and Chinese Doctor Yen, and between Simon and Japanese representative Matsuoka. Later, Matsuoka and Hymans, and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and Japanese Sugimura, each had another conversation. The lights in the offices of the various representatives were extinguished late into the night, later than usual. As the people in the League of Nations are so active, strange rumors about the changes in the situation are spreading outside. However, those who are deeply aware of the content and the various representatives are absolutely not revealing the truth tonight, and the contents of the various talks are kept secret, because they do not want to make untimely remarks before the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen, which may hinder the possible success on Wednesday. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Hymans Responds to Representative Yen</p>
<h3>Amendments Have Been Brought to the Attention of the Special Committee</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chairman Hymans' letter to Dr. Yen reads as follows: "Your letter is received with respect. Regarding the amendments contained in the memorandum you submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat, I have brought to the attention of the Special Committee the points that your government attaches great importance to. As for the second paragraph of your letter, I hereby enclose a copy of the communiqué drafted at the meeting of the Special Committee for your perusal. This communiqué accurately summarizes the truth about the proposals submitted to the Special Committee." The text of the communiqué is attached. Note: Dr. Yen's letter criticizes the amendment of the Drafting Committee's resolution without notifying the Chinese representative. (Reuters News Agency telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Japanese Representatives</p>
<h3>Actively Engage in Separate Activities</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representatives received a telegram from the Japanese Foreign Ministry at 4 PM today and immediately held a representative meeting. Those present were Matsuoka, Sato, Nagaoka, Sugimura, Sawada, and Lieutenant General Tatekawa. They synthesized various information and discussed countermeasures. After the meeting, Matsuoka visited Hymans and Simon, Sugimura visited Drummond, and Nagaoka visited French representative Massigli, pleading for the acceptance of Japan's amendments. They scheduled to visit the various representatives again tomorrow morning, making a final struggle. (Hua Lian News Agency telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan Threatens Again</h3>
<p>Adopting Compulsory Mediation</p>
<p>Preparing to Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>French Newspaper Reports That the Statement of Reasons Has Been Drafted</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is widely rumored in the League of Nations that due to the opposition of small countries, the compromise proposal created by Drummond and Sugimura will be cancelled. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is extremely indignant at this attitude of the League of Nations. The Foreign Ministry is confident that the outcome of this negotiation will definitely be established. However, if the League of Nations applies Article 15, Paragraph 4 and adopts the means of recommending reconciliation, the Foreign Ministry believes that its binding force is quite weak. Moreover, because of the activation of Paragraph 4, the Sino-Japanese problem actually leaves the hands of the League of Nations, and the relationship between the League of Nations and Japan can also be settled. The Foreign Ministry has already decided that when the situation reaches this state, it will implement the withdrawal from the League of Nations. (Nichi Ren News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French press has been very cautious about the League of Nations' handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute recently. However, today's newspapers carried a dispatch from Geneva stating that some member states of the League of Nations have gradually lost their patience, because at the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen on Monday, British Foreign Secretary Simon and French representative Massigli both protested against Japan's delaying policy. According to the report, British Foreign Secretary Simon threatened to apply Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Charter, and French representative Massigli also stated that the League of Nations had exhausted its intelligence in mediating this case. Now that a certain country is suspected of deliberately damaging the prestige of the League of Nations, there is no need to continue the effort. " The viewpoint of the Paris Morning News is that this step is enough to promote Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The newspaper also said that Japan's royal jurists have drafted Japan's statement of withdrawal from the League of Nations, and the reasons for its withdrawal are: "Japan's neighboring countries such as the United States and Russia are not members of the League of Nations, and the League of Nations has been unable to serve peace because it has [globalized] rather than localized the Far East incident." (Guomin News Agency telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is widely rumored that the League of Nations has now reached the point where it has no choice but to adopt the provisions of Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Charter and activate its means of recommending reconciliation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry regards this as an imprudent containment strategy against Japan by the League of Nations, and holds the following opinions: (1) Before the Japanese government's reply is submitted to the League of Nations authorities, the propaganda of the impossibility of negotiations between the two sides is actually a scheming act of the League of Nations. (2) Since the Japanese government intends to accept the League of Nations' proposal under the provisions of Article 15, Paragraph 3, there is absolutely no reason why Paragraph 3 should not be established. (3) The issue of inviting the United States and Russia is not stipulated in the three conditions, so the United States and Russia should not be invited, and there is no reason to stop the activation of Paragraph 3 and adopt the provisions of Paragraph 4. (4) The establishment of the provisions of Paragraph 4 requires the unanimous agreement of all countries other than the two parties involved, but this is extremely difficult. Even if it is established, the means of recommendation has no binding force on Japan, so the Japanese side will absolutely not be affected by it. (Nichi Ren telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Correcting British Newspaper's Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>The Times Recklessly Quotes the Boxer Protocol, Saying That the Responsibility for the Yuguan Incident Does Not Rest with Japan</p>
<h3>We Make a Definite Statement Citing Article 9</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Information Office of the Chinese Delegation to the League of Nations sent a letter to the editor of The Times on the 16th of this month, correcting the newspaper's misunderstanding of the Shanhaiguan incident. It stated, "Your newspaper recently published an editorial entitled 'Hostile Actions in Manchuria,' in which the arguments are quite erroneous. We are making a special statement to draw your attention to them. Your newspaper's editorial said, 'The responsibility for the hostile actions in Shanhaiguan is being shifted back and forth between the two sides. This is often the case when such facts occur. However, from the perspective of the rights granted to Japan by the 1901 Protocol, Yucheng is garrisoned by Japanese troops within the area under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Japanese Army Command. Therefore, the Chinese army is suspected of moving towards the city garrisoned by the Japanese army in accordance with the treaty. As for whether anyone from the Japanese military police threw bombs, it is of little importance and need not be asked.' As mentioned earlier, your newspaper's argument is based on the 1901 Protocol. Article 9 of the Protocol states, 'The Chinese government, by this Protocol and the attached letters, acknowledges the right of the Powers to station troops in certain locations to maintain communication between the capital and the sea. The locations for stationing troops shall be determined by the Powers. Subsequently, the locations for stationing troops determined by the Powers are Huangcun, Langfang, Yangcun, Tianjin, Junliangcheng, Tanggu, Lutai, Tangshan, Changli, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan. However, two points must be noted: First, the location of Shanhaiguan where the Powers station troops is distinctly different from Yucheng, and they are not the same place with different names. Second, according to the 1901 Protocol, the purpose of the Powers stationing troops is only to maintain communication between the capital (Beijing, now renamed Beiping) and the sea, and it does not allow the Powers to set up barracks and station troops in walled cities at each of these locations. Yuguan is north of the Beiping-Shenyang (Fengtian) railway line, including the solar terms. The locations where they are stationed in accordance with the 1901 Protocol are south of the same railway line. Yucheng has always been garrisoned by Chinese troops. Your newspaper's claim that it is usually garrisoned by Japanese troops in accordance with the treaty is a mistake. We have always admired your newspaper's fair arguments, so we are making a special statement, hoping that it will be published in the newspaper." This letter is signed by Luo Zhongyi, Director of the Information Office of the Chinese Delegation to the League of Nations. (Havas telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Japan Pushes the League of Nations to the Brink</p>
<h3>Will Countries Tolerate Associating with It?</h3>
<p>The Manchester Guardian Vigorously Condemns Japan</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian commented on the Manchurian problem today, saying that what the emerging public opinion in Europe has failed to accomplish, the "Japanese scorpion" has accomplished for the League of Nations after sixteen months. The League of Nations Special Committee has been pushed to the brink by Japan's stubbornness. Whether willing or not, the League of Nations seems to have to fall into the water at least. The Daily Summary reported that the current question is whether the League of Nations can tolerate associating with a country that acts like Japan. If so, then what is the League of Nations for? (Reuters telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Public Opinion Is Inconsistent</h3>
<p>The Majority of People Advocate Taking Firm Action Against Japan</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Issue Will Be Submitted to the Cabinet for Discussion Today</p>
<p>(London) British public opinion feels deeply troubled about the Sino-Japanese issue, and opinions are very divided. This situation is becoming increasingly serious under the influence of the incident. After the recent dispute between League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and Irish representative Lester, the Manchester Guardian launched a major attack on Drummond. The intensity of the dispute in public opinion can be seen from this. What the United States will do after all is still unclear at present, and the British left wing has already used the actions of the United States as an excuse to demand that the League of Nations take firm action to deal with Japan. The majority of people in Britain always express that it is not appropriate to contradict the meaning of the United States. When Foreign Secretary Simon attends the cabinet meeting on Thursday, the whole issue will definitely be submitted for discussion. (Havas News Agency telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Japan Insists</p>
<h3>The Outcome Will Inevitably Be Unfavorable</h3>
<p>French People's Observation</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible French officials seemed optimistic tonight about the development of the Sino-Japanese issue, believing that an agreement could be reached. Japan's insistence on not yielding is actually unfavorable to Japan. It is expected that the firm attitude of British and French representatives Simon and Massigli, and the expressions of the United States in London and Paris on Sunday, can achieve results. Public opinion here is now focused on domestic political and financial issues, so the French press rarely criticizes the Far Eastern situation. However, the Paris Times discussed the position of the League of Nations, saying that it is caught between abstract principles and concrete reality, and that it feels very difficult to maintain the dignity of the Covenant on the one hand and prevent Japan from leaving the meeting on the other. However, the newspaper did not make any suggestions on how the Committee of Nineteen could take care of both sides. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Is Weak and Incompetent</h3>
<p>Different Feelings of the Left and Right Wings in Germany</p>
<p>One Is Delighted, the Other Is Afraid</p>
<p>Japan's Withdrawal Would Actually Consolidate the League of Nations' Position</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Far Eastern dispute is attracting considerable attention in German public opinion. The right-wing newspapers are quite satisfied with the actions of the Committee of Nineteen and the difficulties faced by the League of Nations. According to the views of the right-wing newspapers, the negotiations in Geneva to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute are bound to fail. On the contrary, the left-wing newspapers are deeply worried about the authority of the League of Nations. This group believes that the League of Nations should take resolute action. As for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, it would actually reduce the League of Nations' instability, because the League of Nations would no longer have to be timid and avoid difficulties. The reason why the left wing is worried about the League of Nations actually has hidden worries about domestic politics in its heart, because Japan's attitude is enough to prove that although member states insult the League of Nations in every possible way, the League of Nations can only dry its face and do nothing. However, this cowardly attitude of the League of Nations is secretly admired by many people in Germany, so they intend to take the opportunity to resume military preparations. The left-wing people are worried that these things are enough to affect domestic politics, and they cannot help but worry about the future. (Havas telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan Is Dissatisfied with Russia</h3>
<p>Due to the Unilateral Publication of the Negotiations on the Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The negotiations on the Japanese-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty were later interrupted. Previously, the Soviet Russian government had told the Japanese Foreign Ministry that it would publish the entire course of the negotiations. The Japanese Foreign Ministry was considering the form of publication, but yesterday the Soviet Russian government unilaterally published it. The Foreign Ministry expressed dissatisfaction with this as an unfriendly attitude. After receiving the telegram from Ambassador Ota, if the Soviet Russian publication is only beneficial to the Soviet Union, the Japanese side will also publish the truth and appeal to the world's public opinion. (Dentsu News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, which was signed in the nineteenth year, expires on May 16th of this year. At this time when the Japanese are aggressively invading our country's territory, there is no more talk of goodwill and reciprocity. Commercial organizations and people's organizations from various provinces and cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Ping, Tianjin, Yue, Min, Xiang, E, Gan, Jiangzhe, etc., have sent telegrams to the government, requesting the abolition of reciprocal special preferences. The competent authorities have received hundreds of such telegrams. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Instigates Zhang Jinghui</p>
<h3>To Be the Commander-in-Chief of the Invasion of Rehe</h3>
<p>Military Power Is Entirely Controlled by the Japanese</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese Kwantung Army has decided on the plan to invade Rehe. It is heard that the pseudo-commander-in-chief of the invasion of Rehe will be Zhang Jinghui, the pseudo-military and political minister of the pseudo-organization. The Japanese army is controlling all military power behind the scenes. It is said that Zhang Jinghui's appointment as commander-in-chief is only being used by the Japanese military to divert world public opinion. In recent days, the Japanese and traitors' war preparations for invading Rehe have been very busy with the mobilization of troops on various railways. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>On the Far Eastern Situation</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Declares His Attitude</h3>
<p>Maintaining the Sanctity of International Treaties</p>
<p>Not Recognizing the Occupation of Manchuria by Force</p>
<p>US Undersecretary of State Keiser and French Counselor Discuss the Issue of Protecting Overseas Chinese in North China</p>
<p>Consistently Recognizing Rehe as Part of Chinese Territory and Not Wanting to Make Further Statements</p>
<p>(Washington) President-elect Roosevelt published an article today, stating the attitude of the United States towards the Far Eastern situation. The general public believes that this article shows that both the Republican and Democratic parties have a complete understanding of the United States' policy on this issue. Roosevelt stated that American foreign policy must uphold the dignity of international treaties. The full text is as follows: "Any statement relating to any particular diplomatic situation must, of course, come from the Secretary of State, but I am most willing to make it clear that American foreign policy must uphold the dignity of international treaties, which is the cornerstone upon which all relations between nations must be based." Before the publication of this article, there were rumors that Roosevelt supported the current government's policy of not recognizing the land acquired by Japan by force in Manchuria. Newspapers were rushing to report the news that Roosevelt fully agreed with the current government's Eastern policy. However, Roosevelt was unwilling to criticize the news in the newspapers. The New York Herald Tribune's Washington dispatch stated that the United States is currently adhering to the policy of not recognizing "Manchukuo," and there is no other expression besides this. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) US President-elect Roosevelt recently made a simple and clear declaration on the Far Eastern issue. It is believed here that Roosevelt's move is intended to assist the actions of the US representatives in Geneva. (Havas telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to important figures in American political circles, the report that Japan intends to control the Rehe Special District is considered to be part of the larger Manchurian problem. Therefore, the United States will no longer issue new declarations on its Far Eastern policy, that is, the United States does not intend to make a statement on whether it has always recognized Rehe as part of mainland China, or, as the Japanese government claims, as part of Manchuria. Even Far Eastern experts are unwilling to answer this question. However, US officials admit that if Japanese troops move south of the Great Wall, it will cause a new international problem. Although it is unknown at this time whether the US government will issue a new declaration if the Japanese army takes this action, this admission by US officials may be regarded as an indication that the United States will make a statement. Today, Undersecretary of State Keiser met with French Ambassador to the United States Counsellor Bausquet to discuss methods of protecting foreigners in the event of conflicts in the Beiping area. Afterwards, Keiser told people that today's talks were completely informal in nature, and were only discussing methods of international action that could be taken in the Beiping area. However, the stationing of foreign troops may be increased for a time, but they will cooperate with each other in accordance with the provisions of the Boxer Protocol to maintain communication between Beiping and the sea. According to the various indications here at present, it seems that the State Department will not take any action except to reiterate its policy of non-recognition. It is heard that unless a new problem occurs, President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson will wait to see the actions of the League of Nations and the Committee of Nineteen on the Manchurian problem before making any further statements.

<p>(Washington) The State Department declared that the US government had issued an order to US representatives in various countries on January 7, stating that US policy had not changed and still followed the Hoover Doctrine, refusing to recognize situations created in violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The State Department only issued the order to its foreign representatives for three reasons: (1) It did not want to issue a declaration directly in the name of President Roosevelt; (2) It did not want to adopt an offensive attitude to increase Japan's opposition to the United States; (3) The United States had repeatedly sent notes in the past without effect, so it did not want to repeat the mistakes and leave behind criticism. The reason why Secretary of State Stimson reiterated the Hoover Doctrine with such a clear attitude was to quell outside rumors, because some people said that President-elect Roosevelt belonged to a different party than Hoover, and would not continue his predecessor's policy towards the Far East after taking office. Stimson believed that if he remained silent at this time when rumors were spreading, the world would speculate wildly and regard it as a sign that the United States' policy towards Japan was becoming weaker, so that the main force that world public opinion relied on to oppose Japan's actions in China would be reduced. Once Secretary of State Stimson's instructions to foreign representatives were published, it would make it impossible for President Roosevelt to remain silent, and Stimson's personally responsible publication of the order would be even more powerful. The general public believes that although Roosevelt fundamentally agrees with Hoover's policy on the Far Eastern issue, he may have his own opinions on the methods of implementation.

<p>(Beiping) A long-distance telephone report from Rehe stated that about one hundred soldiers from the Japanese "Mika Masae" unit suddenly opened fire on our Nanling position dozens of times last night at 8 o'clock. Our army ignored them. Several dozen soldiers from a unit of the Japanese 6th Division, led by armored vehicles, launched a frontal assault on our Nanling position with machine guns and artillery. We calmly responded, and the enemy retreated at 10 o'clock. The armored vehicles also returned to Nanling. The houses and residents of Sanbaoyingzi in Chaoyang County were completely destroyed. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops in Nanling have repeatedly provoked the garrison in Koubeiyingzi. On the 17th, over one hundred Japanese soldiers, under the cover of armored vehicles, attacked Sanbaoyingzi, engaging our troops for one hour. The Japanese troops retreated to Nanling. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Tang Yulin used the telephone to inquire with Dong Futing's Brigade in Chaoyang County. It was reported that the front was calm, and if the enemy came to fight, they would resolutely resist. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed the Central Government, saying that the Japanese army was provoking, and the situation on the Rehe border was tense. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Ambushed at Duiaqingshan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhanhai's troops in Kailu have been fighting fiercely with the enemy in the Laoyeling and Fuxin Mulitu area for days. The enemy, using a combined force of cavalry and artillery, attempted to attack our volunteer army's position in Kailu. However, they fell into our army's ambush. More than three hundred Japanese soldiers were completely annihilated at Duiaqingshan, more than thirty miles away from Kailu. Japanese aircraft flew to reconnoiter and rescue, but it was too late. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Geng and Dai's Units Establish Contact</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteer army led by Geng Jizhou is currently concentrating in a certain area of Rehe and has established contact with Dai Tao's troops. They plan to advance on Chaoyang. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Battle Situation on the 15th and 16th</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Rehe to Pingfang reported that at 4 PM on the 15th, several hundred enemy and traitor troops, under the cover of armored vehicles, attacked and charged the Nanling position. After Dong's troops bravely fought back, fiercely bombarding them with flat-trajectory artillery, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed, and the enemy retreated in defeat. Around 1 PM on the 16th, over three hundred enemy troops, again under the cover of armored vehicles, attacked Nanling, engaging in fierce fighting with Dong's Rehe army. Three Japanese aircraft also assisted in the battle, dropping over thirty bombs on our position, most of which missed. Our army calmly responded with machine guns and flat-trajectory artillery. Waiting until the enemy approached, they rushed out of the trenches, fiercely throwing hand grenades, killing many enemy and traitor troops. After a three-hour standoff, the enemy finally retreated in defeat. Our army's defenses are solid. Units from a certain area arrived in Nanling as reinforcements. The connection between the Datong and Jinzhou-Chaoyang lines has been completed, and preparations are underway for a large-scale offensive to outflank the enemy. The enemy is focusing on Lingyuan, planning to advance with heavy troops from the Jiuniankou Pass. However, our army's defenses are tight. There is a gap between Shihe and Shimen, as the enemy is busy transporting troops and equipment and constructing fortifications, making the situation tense again. In recent days, apart from small engagements between sentries on the front line, there have been no formal conflicts. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Excerpts from a Discussion with a Certain Important Personage</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain important personage stated that Japan, in attacking Rehe, already knows that we are determined to resist, so they dare not act rashly and are still actively reinforcing and deploying. Because the Japanese army has already learned a lesson in Shanghai, the patriotic spirit of our North China soldiers this time is no less than that of the 19th Route Army. Japan fears another defeat, which would be laughed at by the world. Therefore, the current battle at Yucheng and Jiuniankou is just a small test of their strength. The gains and losses of one or two places are not important. The major bloody battle is yet to come. The soldiers and officers of our army who are ordered to depart are all delighted and encouraged, while those ordered to stay behind are weeping bitterly, regretting that they cannot kill the enemy.

<p>Japanese Residents in Yuguan Ordered to Withdraw Towards Guandong</p>
<p>Although the situation in Lin Yu, Yu Guan, Shihe, Qinhuangdao, and Jiuniankou appears calm on the surface, it is actually becoming increasingly tense. The enemy troops are concentrating in western Liaoning and are about to expand their military operations. The end of the lunar year and the beginning of spring will be the most critical and dangerous time. Nishio Ichizo, the commander of the 8th Division, arrived in Yu Guan from Jinzhou by train on the 17th to inspect the positions and held a meeting, personally explaining the operational plan to Brigade Commander Suzuki.

<p>(Beiping) A person from the east said that Liao Bichen's 3,000 troops, after mutinying, cooperated with Li Chunrun's unit of over one hundred troops to occupy Kuandian and Huanren. Li Shoushan, the puppet army brigade commander, is secretly expanding his power in the Zhuanghe and Andong area, with the intention of seizing the Eastern Border political power. The Japanese army is very panicked. The Japanese army in Anshu is extremely busy with transportation. Every two or three days, a troop train must pass through. Among the Japanese army's comfort items, there are occasional communist leaflets that incite mutiny. Therefore, the Japanese army is uneasy. The heads of the Japanese army headquarters are very anxious but have been unable to stop it. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Puppet State Military Spy</p>
<h3>Yu Daxuan Secretly Arrives in Ping</h3>
<p>Ping Authorities Dispatch Police to Investigate</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet Manchurian state dispatched military spy Yu Daxuan, accompanied by a former Zhili-Lu United Army brigade commander Yao, to Ping, hiding in the Dongjiaominxiang to spy on our military situation and report to the puppet state. The military and police authorities in Ping are paying close attention to the rampant activities of the puppet state. Yu is Zheng Xiaoxu's nephew, studied in Japan for many years, and served as the director of the puppet Changchun Police Bureau. Because he colluded with the Japanese in embezzlement, he was discovered, detained by the Japanese, and later released on bail. Now, the puppet state plans to send personnel to Ping to spy on military information. No one dared to come, so Zheng Xiaoxu recommended Yu to take on the task. Yu then secretly came to Ping and Tianjin with the Japanese Komatsu and others and began activities. The authorities have been dispatching disguised police officers in recent days to investigate and capture him for legal action. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Stalemate and Obscurity of the Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>(1) The Hardening of Japan-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are neither too close nor too distant. Since the establishment of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement in August last year, the immediate tensions between the two countries seemed to have been temporarily alleviated to some extent. With the subsequent visit of Matsukata Kojiro to the Soviet Union and the realization of the oil agreement, an additional layer of economic relations was added between Japan and the Soviet Union. If this could progress smoothly, the Non-Aggression Treaty would not be difficult to establish. Japan's external defense line would be temporarily shortened, and it would be able to solely expand its Pacific defense line, having more than enough strength to invade our country. Its strength would be more sufficient, and its situation would be more complete. However, the Japanese militarists overestimate themselves, insisting on implementing their "Continental Policy," invading North China to the west and devouring the Chinese Eastern Railway to the north. In the minds of the Japanese, the so-called Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty is thought to be beneficial to the Soviets. At the very least, there should be an exchange of conditions. In terms of empty reputation, the Soviets must recognize the "Manchukuo" puppet state. In terms of practical benefits, the Soviets must cede the Chinese Eastern Railway. Fisheries and oil are also secondary objectives, while the development of Siberia is actually a part of the "Continental Policy."</p>
<p>However, the Soviet authorities are not fools. Fifteen years of bloodless struggle, continuing efforts, have already yielded considerable results. Therefore, Stalin commented on his country's national defense, saying:</p>
<p>"At the end of 1932, Soviet production had increased by 334 percent compared to before the European war... The difference from the entire Five-Year Plan is 6 percent. The reason for the delay is that some neighboring countries refused to sign non-aggression treaties, and the change in the Eastern situation forced some factories to switch their machines to manufacture new weapons to strengthen national defense. However, because of this change, the shortcomings of the Soviet Union in national defense have been made up. The Soviet Union has transformed from a weak country with no defensive capabilities to a strong country with strong defensive capabilities. Its industry can manufacture all new types of weapons to deal with any external attack..." At the same time, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's reaction to Stalin's speech, as reported by the Telegraph News Agency:</p>
<p>"The reason why the Japanese military is demanding a huge electricity fee in next year's budget is that the Soviet Union is requesting Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty on one hand, while preparing the entire nation for war on the other. Therefore, the possibility of Japan and the Soviet Union concluding a non-aggression treaty now has also disappeared..."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the fundamental conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union is, in fact, unavoidable. The fisheries agreement and the oil agreement are both temporary in nature, exchanging fish and oil for peace. How could the Soviets have any lasting intention? Japan still believes that this is not enough, as fully occupying the fisheries is just the beginning of Japan's foreign aggression. Occupying the Chinese Eastern Railway and seizing all three northeastern provinces would barely satisfy the first step of the Continental Policy. Although the Soviet Union tries hard to restrain itself, devoting all its efforts to its internal construction, it does not make unreasonable concessions. Therefore, in response to "the change in the Eastern situation... (it was necessary to) manufacture new defensive weapons (to) strengthen (its) national defense force." Japan immediately used this as an excuse to drastically increase its military budget to 820 million yen.</p>
<p>(2) Peace and Patience Have a Limit</p>
<p>The world's economic panic is becoming increasingly severe. The internal contradictions of capitalism are becoming more and more evident. The antagonism between Japan and the United States is intensifying. There is a lack of harmony between Britain and the United States in particular. In this situation, it is not difficult for the Soviet Union to try its best to maintain peace, endure and concede, and not be the first to start a war. However, peace and patience must have a certain limit. It is not like our country's magnanimity, even though it has lost 3,776,700 square miles of territory, it still calmly accepts it, practicing forbearance and seeking completeness in order to beg for peace. Therefore, the Soviet Union, wary of the complex situation in the Far East, is doing its utmost to be vigilant, preferring to sacrifice 6 percent of valuable construction to make up for the shortcomings in national defense.</p>
<p>In terms of military strength, the Soviet Union's standing army has 21 combat army corps, 28 sniper divisions, 41 militia divisions, 9 cavalry divisions, 2 militia cavalry divisions, 4 mechanized divisions, 210 air squadrons, and 13 balloon squadrons. The number of aircraft is over 1,600. (Naval power is extremely weak and not worth mentioning.) It is difficult to estimate how many troops it can deploy in wartime. Judging from its current conscription system, it is not difficult to have 4 million elite soldiers. As for Japan, it has 17 standing army divisions, plus the South Manchuria Railway garrison, the Taiwan garrison, the Korean military police, 7 army aviation regiments, 4 naval aircraft carriers, and 1,400 aircraft. (Although the Japanese navy is one of the three major navies, it has no use against the Soviet Union.) The number of soldiers in wartime is difficult to exceed 3.5 million. If the Japanese militarists take military risks and lightly provoke and invade Soviet territory, it is feared that the Soviet Union will no longer endure and will certainly rise up to defend itself.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese militarists are also very clear about their reconnaissance of the enemy. If they start a war with the Soviet Union, what is the certainty of victory? They themselves cannot help but have doubts. Moreover, the cold weather and the lessons learned from the Siberian expedition in 1920, how dare they lightly start a conflict with the Soviet Union and fall into the quagmire? Furthermore, the Soviet Union of today is no longer comparable to the one that had no national defense preparations. Therefore, if the Japanese militarists do not go crazy, they will not use force to invade Siberia as they did the three northeastern provinces. Moreover, the Japanese imperialists have already begun to occupy North China. Even if our country continues to resist, they still need a considerable amount of troops to maintain their aggressive exploitation. Where would they have the surplus strength to invade the Soviet Union? Therefore, even if the Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty truly stalls and disappears, it will only intensify the urgency of the conflict. As for the outbreak of war, it still needs time to brew and space to stimulate.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Work-Study Students</h3>
<p>Tuition Fees Must Be Pre-Deposited in That Country</p>

<p>U.S. Senate Overrides President's Veto</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Original Bill for Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>This Case Passed is a Victory for the American Farmers' Party</p>
<p>However, it Failed to Arouse the Filipinos' Enthusiasm</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th - Today, the Senate voted 66 to 27 to uphold the original bill for Philippine independence, overriding President Hoover's veto. Senator Borah spoke before the vote, saying that if the United States waited until a day of complete peace and disarmament, the Philippines would never be free. Borah did not agree with the provision in the treaty stipulating the neutrality of the Philippines, saying that if the United States kept its promise and granted it independence, it would make our moral dignity in the East trusted and respected. When the voting results were announced, many Filipinos in the audience applauded. The passage of this case is a victory for the American Farmers' Party, and sugar planters are especially welcome, as they are afraid of Filipino competition. This case will become law. If the Philippine Congress accepts this case within one year, the Philippines can be completely independent in 10 to 13 years. If the Philippine Congress does not accept it within one year, this issue will again fall into turmoil.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 17th - The draft law on Philippine independence was previously passed by both houses of the United States Congress. Because President Hoover vetoed it, it was returned to Congress. According to the United States Constitution, Congress must pass the original case again by a two-thirds majority or more, so that the President's veto can be overridden. On the 14th of this month, the House of Representatives voted 274 to 94 to resolve to uphold the original case. Today, the Senate also made the same decision with 66 votes to 27 votes. The above voting results are all in line with the法定majority, and it seems that the case of granting the right to independence to the Philippine Islands ten years later has already become law.</p>
<h3>Will Appeal to the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 17th - Senator Borah said that if the protection of American agriculture from the competition of Philippine agricultural products is desired, there is no other way but to pass this case. If the Philippines is still retained, it is impossible to tax Philippine goods. Senator Coupal claimed that he knew that the President's veto would be overturned, but constitutionally speaking, the reasons for this case are not very strong. He also said that this case will definitely go through the Supreme Court procedure, and will comprehensively consider the history of the United States acquiring the Philippines. The Philippines was purchased from Spain. If the Philippines can be abandoned, then Louisiana and the state of Qi are not impossible to abandon.</p>
<h3>Philippine Speaker Still Not Satisfied</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 18th - After the news of the U.S. Senate re-passing the Philippine Independence Act arrived here, it failed to arouse the Filipinos' enthusiasm. Generally, Filipinos often follow the will of the leaders of the independence movement, and it seems that they believe that this case has not fully met the needs of the Philippines. Philippine Senate Speaker Qu Sun claimed that this case cannot satisfy the Filipinos. He will go to Washington again to work with Secretary of State Stimson in hopes of getting a better bill. Judging from this, some parties here believe that Qu Sun's words indicate that he is prepared to stop the movement for complete independence, making it more beneficial for the Philippines to remain a self-governing territory forever. This is because Stimson now opposes the idea of Philippine independence and gives the Filipinos a highly autonomous government. As for the approval by the representatives of the independence movement sent to Washington for this case, there is also a lot of criticism here.</p>
<h3>Japan Has Expressed Welcome</h3>
<p>Electrical Communications Agency, Tokyo, 18th - Although President Hoover exercised his veto power over the Philippine Independence Act, it was passed by the Upper House. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the following thoughts on it: Japan, from an active position of peace in the Far East, welcomes the independence of the Philippines. Although the United States pays great attention to Japan, Japan has nothing to do with the Philippines except to care about its economy. Therefore, the result of Philippine independence may alleviate the feelings of the people of Japan and the United States. However, the United States has a naval base at Manila, and the military threat to the Far East still exists and cannot be ignored. The so-called independence case has a ten-year hesitation period. If the situation changes during that period, it may be denied again. Therefore, on the Philippine side, it is not permissible to be very optimistic.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan Relations are More Profound</h3>
<p>United Press Agency, Tokyo, 18th - On the 17th, the United States Upper House passed the Philippine Independence Act again with a majority of 66 votes to 27 votes. The relationship between the United States and Japan after Philippine independence is even more profound. What kind of policy will the United States use to protect the security of the Philippines is particularly noteworthy. It is heard that the Democratic and Republican parties have secretly discussed the Far East policy several times, and the two sides have reached a complete consensus. Japan's expectations for Roosevelt's pro-Japanese policy have been 　hopeless.</p>
<p>The World News Agency said that last year the Nagasaki Shimbun in Japan published [The Great Pacific War Theory] to promote a war between Japan and the United States. The agency translated and published it. Recently, the newspaper published another thesis of the same nature, entitled [The Struggle for China's 400 Million Yuan Market]. The article also said that a war between Japan and the United States is inevitable. The agency will translate the part of the article on the wartime situation of both sides for readers' reference.</p>
<p>(Above omitted) Although the ratio of warships (to the United States) is based on the London Treaty, in 1936 it was 10 (US) to 6 (Japan) for battleships and 10 (US) to 7 (Japan) for auxiliary ships, but at present Japan surpasses the United States in actual numbers. However, even</p>
<h3>United States Divided into Two Countries</h3>
<p>Interesting Proposal in the State Legislature</p>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from Bismarck, 17th: In the Senate of North Dakota, USA, today, State Senator Martin proposed a shocking bill, advocating for the division of the United States into two countries. He stated that the eastern states exploit others for their own benefit, that the eastern states are all wealthy, while other states are not. Therefore, he proposes dividing the country into two: the nine eastern states, namely New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, would form one country, using a striped flag; the remaining thirty-nine states would form another country, using a star-spangled banner. This bill is currently shelved and not yet discussed.</p>
<p>Even by 1936, Japan will definitely not show weakness. By then, [Manchukuo] will also have built many warships. However, although Japan has a defensive alliance with it, Japan's military force is more than sufficient, and there is no need to borrow it. Japan is a long and narrow country, so if the United States uses warships to bombard it, it will not have much effect. It must rely mainly on aircraft. Currently, although the United States intends to successively sell aircraft to China and build airfields in China, such actions violate international treaties. Under Japan's watchful eye, the United States likely wouldn't dare to risk acting inappropriately. Even if it were to realize such plans, airfields easily attacked by Japan would also be easily attacked by Japan, so the advantages and disadvantages would still offset each other. Therefore, the United States probably won't take this action but can only massively build aircraft carriers to transport fully loaded aircraft to the vicinity of Japan. In response to this, Japan also has countermeasures. It can send submarines far to the vicinity of the United States to attack its aircraft carriers. At this point, the United States will inevitably use its old circular formation strategy, carefully arranging aircraft carriers, battlecruisers, submarines, and other large fleets into a large circular formation to evade Japanese submarines and approach Japan. This can prevent Japanese aircraft attacks.</p>
<p>Moreover, the United States can attack Japan via three routes: (1) directly from the Aleutian Islands to Hokkaido, Japan; (2) directly from Hawaii and the Philippines to Kyushu, Japan. Although there is convenience for resting along the way with these two routes, both of these war strategies involve attacking the ends of Japan, so their effect is weak and cannot inflict a fatal blow on Japan. The third route involves directly attacking Tokyo Bay in central Japan in one go. Although there is difficulty in not being able to rest along the way, its threat to Japan is greater. Therefore, according to the opinions of Japanese experts, it is predicted that the United States will choose this central route.</p>
<p>If the United States were to attack in this way, Japan would inevitably be slightly troubled. Because Japan is a long and narrow country, there is no need to worry if the enemy attacks with cannons, but if aircraft drop bombs everywhere, it would be a major predicament for us. First, in the Kyushu region, Mitsubishi, Sasebo, and the Yahata Iron Works are all adjacent to each other, making it convenient for the enemy to destroy them all at once. Moreover, Yahata is the only iron works in all of Japan, so we believe it is necessary to establish another one elsewhere. It would also be best if the Showa Steel Works were relocated to a more suitable location as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Devastating Storm in Lisbon</h3>
<p>Large Trees Uprooted, Roofs Torn Off</p>
<p>Six Lighters Sunk by Huge Waves</p>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from Lisbon, 17th: A violent storm occurred in Lisbon today. The severity of the disaster is rare in recent years. Many power lines in the city were blown down, large trees were uprooted, and the roofs of many houses were torn off by the wind. The damage to ships in the port was particularly heavy. Six lighters were sunk by the waves. The crew members were rescued with extreme difficulty. The amount of property loss will certainly be huge, but there are currently no confirmed reports of loss of life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the American attack may not be limited to a frontal attack but may come in three directions. If so, Japan would also have to respond in three directions. Also, assuming the enemy fails, the defeated army will inevitably scurry and lurk in the seas of the East and cause harm to merchants at sea. If they threaten Japanese merchant ships sailing to China, Southeast Asia, and Europe, it will prevent Japan from conducting trade. To prevent this, Japanese warships must patrol everywhere to fulfill their duty of protecting merchant ships. In this way, it would be no different than being trapped in a state of protracted war, but this is factually unavoidable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the United States has Europe across the Atlantic to trade with, so the difficulties it feels in trade are not as great as Japan's. This point is also a disadvantage for Japan. Therefore, Japan must strive to achieve true independence for the Philippines, acquire Hawaii, and tirelessly guard the sea defenses of Asia. This is the responsibility of our naval authorities.

<p>Congratulations from Politicians of Various Countries</p>
<h3>Lloyd George's Seventieth Birthday</h3>
<p>George Issues a Message to the Nation</p>
<p>1.  Britain Urgently Needs Vision and Courage</p>
<p>To Become a Great and Strong Nation</p>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from London, 17th: Former Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Lloyd George celebrated his seventieth birthday today. Congratulatory telegrams poured in from all over. Foreign politicians, political enemies, and friends all sent their congratulations. George made a sound film with his family at his home in North Wales today. Every household in the village hung flags to pay tribute. George issued a message to the nation, mentioning the global economic trends and saying that in these trends, nothing is more harmful than shrinking back and hesitating. He said there is an urgent need for visionary and courageous action. If these virtues can be demonstrated, Britain can escape its current difficulties and become an even greater and stronger nation.</p>
<h3>German Political Situation Still Chaotic</h3>
<p>Hitler Arrives in Berlin for Negotiations</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Berlin, 17th: Hitler arrived here this afternoon and immediately held an important meeting with Hugenberg, the leader of the right-wing German National People's Party. Beforehand, Hitler had spoken with former Chancellor von Papen on the phone, preparing for this meeting. Some people believe that this time Hitler is seeking closer ties with Hugenberg, hoping for greater success than in August and November of last year. However, Hitler has consistently been unwilling to consider cooperating with Chancellor Schleicher, so the political situation remains chaotic.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Berlin, 18th: The Nazi Party declared that Hitler does not want to initiate a meeting with Chancellor Schleicher, but he will remain in Berlin until Sunday to continue negotiations. In addition, responsible parties said that Chancellor Schleicher will meet with Reichstag President of the Bavarian Catholic Party, Dr. Held, on Friday, but does not intend to meet with other party leaders. However, the liberal newspaper Vossische Zeitung stated that the attempt to have Schleicher meet with Hitler has not been abandoned. The newspaper also said that on Friday, the Speaker of the Reichstag (National Socialist), Göring, will meet with Schleicher as usual to discuss the agenda of the Reichstag, at which time the party can make a decision on the aforementioned meeting.</p>
<h3>Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspapers: Since the September 18th Incident, Tang Yulin has been determined to resist Japan and defend the territory. All national salvation righteous armies are welcomed and united to assist. Recently, I read in Shanghai newspapers that the troops of He Minhun and Bai Wei are resisting Japan in Jehol, with frequent reports of their battles. After investigation, there are no such people as He Minhun and Bai Wei in the righteous armies of Jehol, nor is there any such event. At this time when the country is in distress, I fear that someone is using the name to swindle money, affecting the national salvation work. I hereby announce to the people of the country so that they may understand the truth. Please publish it in your newspapers to avoid spreading false rumors. Thank you very much. Tang Yulin [seal]</p>
<p>Telegram from San Francisco to the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, to be forwarded to Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and all soldiers and civilians of the country: The Japanese bandits are advancing deeply, and the national situation is in critical danger. Rather than sit and wait for death, why not seek survival in the midst of death? We hope that all soldiers and civilians of the country will mobilize together to crush their fierce flames and promote our national prestige. All overseas Chinese vow to be your support. Tan Guangzhong, Chairman of the Anti-Japanese General Association of the Chinese General Association of San Francisco, respectfully kowtows.</p>
<h3>Japan's 1933 War Budget (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Japan News)</p>
<p>Militaristic Policies and Preparations to Attack Russia</p>
<p>Expanding Expenditures and Financial Crisis</p>
<p>(Emergency National Relief Fund)</p>
<p>The 63rd session of the Diet in August 1932 was called the [Emergency National Relief Diet.] It deceptively advertised the rescue of poor farmers and small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, but it was just a publicity [stunt.] The issue of the relief fund was initially thought to be as much as 700 to 800 million yen, but when it was resolved, it was only 263 million yen. But the small amount aside, who knew that of this mere 200 million yen, one reason was that [the prices of rice and silk cocoons have risen, and farmers do not need relief,] and another reason was that [national defense spending is indispensable.] In the end, most of the relief fund was added to the expenses of the army and navy to be used to manufacture direct military supplies. The remaining amount was allocated to construction of airfields and modification of military roads in these civil engineering projects.</p>
<p>The 1933 budget for the relief fund is 207 million yen, managed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The Ministry of Interior's relief fund is allocated to road construction, water control, and harbor construction projects, of which 91.62 million yen is from the central government and an unspecified amount is from local governments, totaling 144.92 million yen. The government says that these civil engineering projects can accommodate unemployed people in rural areas and are a form of unemployment relief. But in reality, [relief] is just a name. Aren't road construction, water control, and harbor construction the same as the military facilities mentioned above, signs of war and unrest? To be precise, these are also military expenses. But regardless of whether the government categorizes them as military expenses, one only needs to ask if they can use these funds to help the unemployed. Of the civil engineering expenses in the relief fund, 60% to 70% are for raw materials such as wood, iron, and cement, which are expensive imports. The remaining portion is divided among engineers and contractors. At the same time, there are over 3.5 million unemployed people who cannot receive even a penny of wages, and the consumer goods they need for their lives (rice and others) are skyrocketing due to currency inflation. The government says that the average wage per person is calculated at 70 sen, and the 1933 budget can accommodate 113.42 million people. If they were to use the total amount of the budget for wages as they say, it would still not be enough. Therefore, in reality, fewer than 100,000 people are hired, and even if there are more, they will not receive wages. Not only that, but local governments still have to extract public rents and taxes from the working masses.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Takahashi said, [I believe that if the Emergency National Relief Fund can continue to be maintained for three years, the expected results can be fully achieved.] He then said, [Everyone can rest assured that after three years, everyone can become rich, and taxes can be increased by 1935.] This is clearly a Hoover-esque empty theory, a failure to advertise [false prosperity.]</p>
<p>Looking again at the relief projects of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, they are divided into three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Rural civil engineering projects, 48,410,000 yen</p>
<p>(2) Facilities for revitalizing rural economic regeneration, 3,230,000 yen</p>
<p>(3) Rice storage incentive fund, 5,000,000 yen</p>
<p>Totaling 56,640,000 yen</p>
<p>(1) The handling of civil engineering expenses is the same as that of the Ministry of Interior: either forcing workers to work on military facility construction sites with low or no wages. Especially in the thoroughly impoverished rural areas of today, they still forcibly levy taxes and use in-kind rent to alleviate the struggles against rent. As for those farmers who cannot pay even rice, wheat, or charcoal (except for cocoons), they replace taxes with forced labor.</p>
<p>(2) Facilities for revitalizing rural economic regeneration are merely temporary relief measures to establish side businesses and small combinations. They are almost inapplicable to middle-poor farmers.</p>
<p>(3) The rice storage incentive fund is because rice can be stored for a relatively long time, so the brown rice storage incentive law has recently been implemented, but it is merely a wartime food policy. The beneficiaries are not middle-poor farmers but landowners and wealthy farmers.</p>
<p>(National Debt Expenses)</p>
<p>The government plans to use public bonds to make up for huge losses, so another 1.2 billion yen in new public bonds will be issued in 1933. The current amount of public bonds has reached 6.4 billion yen. Adding the unissued amount of public bonds from 1932, the total amount of public bonds is as high as 8 billion yen. Interest is calculated at 5%, totaling 400 million yen. Adding 100 million yen in additional interest due to exchange rate depreciation, the total is 500 million yen. This 500 million yen in interest flows freely into the hands of financial capitalists. The source of the interest ultimately cannot escape the two paths of increasing taxes or issuing new public bonds. The former will not be discussed here. As for the latter, the increased issuance of public bonds is now undertaken by the Bank of Japan. The Bank of Japan assumes this public bond and will issue its convertible notes without limitation, causing currency inflation (i.e., an oversupply of currency) and soaring prices, making the price of labor cheaper without the knowledge of the working masses. But the authorities of Japanese imperialism, in order to thoroughly implement their militaristic policies, this kind of policy is inherently unavoidable. Annual expenditures are endlessly expanding. At the same time, due to the increasingly deepening poverty of the working masses, tax revenue is becoming relatively smaller and smaller. Therefore, they have no choice but to reissue public bonds.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Budget is War</h3>
<p>Here, the most important thing is the interpretation of the meaning of military expenditure and the limitation of its scope. The newspapers used by the imperial government, social democratic commentators, and progressive financial scholars mostly only erase the army and navy expenditures mentioned above and their directly affiliated facility expenses as military expenditure. Today, the entire Japanese budget is buried under military facilities and is aimed at war. This inherent meaning, such as the expenses for establishing research institutes of science and awarding invention in the education expenditure, are for war purposes. Today's war is very different from the war of the past. The scope of its mobilization and the types and quantities of weapons, food, etc., used are extremely large. For example, toxic gas cannot be stored. Therefore, the most important thing at present is the preparation of several large military factories and the transformation of major, medium, and small factories in the entire industry into military factories as much as possible. For example, celluloid factories, fertilizer factories, and arsenals can be converted into gunpowder and explosive factories; safe factories can be converted into tank factories; watch factories can be converted into shell fuze factories; rubber overshoe factories can be converted into balloon factories; cupronickel and copper product factories can be converted into rifle factories; rayon product factories can be converted into aircraft coating film factories, and so on.</p>
<p>Regarding combat personnel, the first mobilization of the war requires one million people. Continuing the war for a long time requires the mobilization of ten million people. Two or three hundred thousand active soldiers are by no means enough. Therefore, Japanese imperialists require all kinds of training for the reserve army, the veterans' association, the youth corps, the youth training centers, and the fire brigades (including spiritual training) and do not hesitate to spend a part of their budget for these facilities. Although all these facilities are not directly consumed for soldiers and weapons, they are all very important to the military. Therefore, it is a mistake to only count the items that nominally belong to the army and navy or are directly related to them, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's Manchurian Incident expenses, the establishment expenses of judicial consulates in the [pseudo-state of Hsinking], the establishment expenses of the gendarmerie headquarters of the Ministry of Finance, the first reserve fund for the Manchurian Incident expenses, the aviation research unification experiment expenses of the Ministry of Education, the aircraft manufacturing expenses of the Aviation Research Institute, the Manchurian Incident expenses of the Ministry of Posts, and the Manchurian immigration expenses of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, as military expenses.</p>
<p>The emergency national relief fund is also directly aimed at war. In order to reduce their worries and be able to devote themselves to the war wholeheartedly, the Japanese government has to flaunt a banner of [relief] for the tendency of the working masses to become impoverished. However, on the one hand, the so-called [relief] is only to avoid shaking the government's position and is not sincerely intended to provide relief to the working masses and the unemployed. On the other hand, this kind of false [relief] is only a minimum [relief] that shifts with the interests of the authorities. These [reliefs] only put the beautiful name of [unemployment relief] on certain local military civil engineering projects or military industrial work. After we know that the so-called [relief] is actually this way, then there is no need to spend any more words to say that the [relief fund] is aimed at war. Finally, there is no need to mention the national debt expenses, which endlessly transfer interest to financial capitalists.</p>
<p>In this way, we know that the so-called military expenditure only refers to those that are directly aimed at war, and other expenses are indirect. To say it again, the entire Japanese budget is aimed at war. No matter what item of expenditure, it cannot escape being consumed for this purpose. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robbery of a Pig Boat; Crewman Stabbed; Yu Xiwu, a local Huairenfang villager, makes a living by selling pigs. The other day, Yu called up fellow friends Xu A'er, Yang Yunquan, and a Jiangbei man, carrying more than two hundred silver dollars, hired a boat, and planned to go to Qingyang to buy pigs. When they reached the Xie Jiao Jian area, the ice was so strong that they could not move forward, so they stopped there. At the same time, there were a total of twenty-one boats, including firewood boats, rice boats, and manure boats, stopped there. Unexpectedly, at around 8 PM, more than a hundred bandits suddenly appeared, wearing tattered old uniforms, each holding long guns and bayonets and other weapons. They first boarded the pig boat to search for valuables and stabbed Xu and Yang in the arms, legs, and other places with bayonets. Then they went to other boats to search for valuables. None of the twenty-one boats were spared. The total loss was five or six hundred yuan. While the bandits were searching for valuables, Xu A'er took advantage of the opportunity to escape with his injuries, arrived in the city on foot at around 11 PM, and went to Puren Hospital to treat his wounds. Meanwhile, the boat owner reported to the county to request an arrest.</p>
<h3>Quanzhou</h3>
<p>Commander Mao Pays Attention to Local Security</p>
<p>Quanzhou is a major city in Fujian, and bandits have been rampant for many years. The local area has been ravaged by them, and exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are endless. Cases of kidnapping and robbery occur almost every day. The people of this county are often in dire straits and feel like they are living in thorny and dangerous places. Since Commander Mao of the 61st Division of the Fujian Army came to be stationed here, he has diligently suppressed bandits, striving to eliminate them at their roots, and has worked hard to stabilize the security. All kinds of past solicitations, supplies, and the setting up of taxes at will, and tolerating of evil-doing, have been swept away in one fell swoop. His blessings to our county and our Fujian are truly not shallow.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Protective Donation Riot in Pingchao is Expanding</p>
<p>In the Pingchao district of Nantong, a large-scale bloody incident in which four farmers were shot to death occurred on the fifth of this month due to the collection of protective donations, sparking a riot. District Leader Wang Zhenqi arrested fourteen villagers, including Shen Hongkui, and sent them to the county government, accusing them of being rioters and gathering crowds to seize guns. On the sixteenth, under the interrogation of County Magistrate Zhang Xixun, the case was found to be due to Shen Hongkui's protective donation of 5 yuan and 6 jiao, of which 3 yuan had already been paid, and the remaining 2 yuan was scheduled to be paid on the 20th. The district office sent Township Head Chen Shufang to arrest Shen with more than twenty protective squad members. At the same time, five other people, including Zhao Sheng, were arrested. After Shen and others were arrested, they were hung up and beaten, causing injuries all over their bodies. County Magistrate Zhang specially photographed the injuries for record. All the villagers denied gathering crowds to seize guns. As for the four villagers who were shot to death, including Lin Kou, they were shot by the protective squad in front of the district office, causing the villagers to angrily destroy the district office. The villagers wanted to carry the four corpses into the city to appeal for justice, but they were stopped by the police team. The villagers are now extremely angry, and the situation is serious and not easy to handle. At 5 PM on the sixteenth, County Magistrate Zhang rushed to inspect and comfort the villagers and telegraphed the case to the province for instructions.</p>

<p>Decreased by 45,848,000 Taels Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>However, Both Foreign and Domestic Debts Guaranteed by Customs Revenue Have Been Paid in Full as Scheduled</p>
<p>Regarding the national customs revenue situation for the 21st year of the Republic of China, after the report from the Customs Inspectorate, Mr. Mellow, to the Ministry of Finance, Minister Song Ziwen officially announced it yesterday. The total national customs revenue amounted to approximately 200,239,000 Customs Taels, a decrease of 45,848,000 Customs Taels compared to the total customs revenue of 246,087,000 Customs Taels in the 20th year of the Republic of China. A breakdown of import duties, export duties, transit duties, tonnage dues, etc., is as follows:</p>
<p>Import Duties: 165,301,000 Customs Taels, equivalent to 139,849,000 Gold Units</p>

<h3>Two Organizations Telegraph Duan and Wu</h3>
<p>Eagerly Awaiting Prompt Declaration</p>
<p>Do Not Fall for Japanese Deceitful Schemes</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Local Associations and Exchanges telegraphed Duan and Wu yesterday, stating: "To Mr. Duan Zhiquan in Tianjin and Mr. Wu Ziyu in Beiping, Greetings. With the Japanese invaders penetrating deeper, the national crisis is increasingly urgent. Saving the nation and saving ourselves is a shared aspiration. Your esteemed public figures possess virtue and reputation, admired throughout the country. Witnessing the fragmentation of our rivers and mountains and the loss of our people, you must be shedding blood and pounding your chests, filled with profound grief. We are eagerly anticipating your call to loyalty and righteousness, rising up for the survival of the nation, serving as the public's vanguard and the government's backing. However, rumors are circulating that the Japanese have recently been engaging in deceitful schemes in the Tianjin and Beiping areas, employing various temptations and even colluding with former subordinates under the guise of officialdom, spreading a false sense of peace in hopes of numbing the people's hearts. Should you fall into this trap, the consequences will be immeasurable. With your mature statesmanship, you will surely see through their insidious plots. However, we fear that confusion and misinformation may tarnish your reputation. We earnestly hope that you will promptly issue a declaration, stating your position and restraining your former subordinates from associating with treacherous individuals, lest you lose the trust of the people and leave behind an infamous legacy of national betrayal. Should any Japanese seek an audience, you must firmly refuse them. The foundation of the nation is at stake, and your personal integrity is on the line. Having heard these concerns, we dare not remain silent. Looking north towards Yan and Yun, we are filled with longing. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Local Association and Joint Association of Exchanges, with utmost sincerity."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Negotiating Important Matters and Returning to Nanjing Within Days</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning around 8:00 AM via the Beijing-Shanghai night express train. Due to pressing official duties in Nanjing in recent days, Mr. Song immediately returned to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest after disembarking. He declined to meet guests in the morning. In the afternoon, Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and others paid him visits. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Tang Hai'an at the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office yesterday and inquired about various matters. According to Tang, Mr. Song came to Shanghai in haste because he had important matters to negotiate with various circles in the local area and would have to return to the capital within two or three days. Since the fall of Shanhaiguan, the situation in North China has become increasingly critical, and developments in the League of Nations are unpredictable. To facilitate the payment of all expenses, Mr. Song cannot remain away from the capital for long. Tang continued to discuss the general situation of customs revenue, saying that after the Sino-Japanese Incident, customs revenue declined, with revenue in the 21st year decreasing by more than 38 million yuan compared to the 20th year, which has an impact on the national treasury. In light of this, Mr. Song has decided to reorganize the salt tax to compensate for the shortfall in customs revenue. That is why Mr. Song previously flew to the Haizhou area to inspect salt affairs, which is a precursor to the reorganization of the salt tax.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Beiping and Shanghai-Hankou Air Routes</p>
<h3>Flights Continued Yesterday Despite Snowfall</h3>
<p>Turned Back After Passing Qingdao Due to Severe Weather</p>
<p>Flights Westbound From Shanghai To Chongqing And Eastbound To Hankou Are Halted En Route</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping route was suspended the day before due to weather conditions. It reopened yesterday, but was unable to proceed north after reaching Qingdao. The Shanghai-Hankou route was also halted en route after opening. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Arrived in Qingdao Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Beiping northbound flight did not depart the day before. Although yesterday was not a scheduled flight day, it still took off from Longhua at 7:15 AM, piloted by Anderson, carrying 6,370 kilograms of mail. Nie Kaiyi, Director of the Flight Crew, was unable to accompany the flight due to unforeseen circumstances. It arrived in Haizhou at 10:15 AM and departed at 10:25 AM, arriving in Qingdao at 11:55 AM. It added 44 kilograms of mail and departed Qingdao northbound at 12:20 PM. However, due to severe weather and difficult flying conditions, it turned back and returned to Qingdao at 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hankou Halts En Route</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou westbound flight was also halted the day before due to fog. Although it was snowing heavily yesterday, it still departed as scheduled. However, after passing Nanjing, it also turned back to Nanjing at 11:50 AM due to severe weather. The eastbound flight departed from Hankou at 9:00 AM but has not yet been heard from, and is presumed to be temporarily halted en route.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Losses from the January 28th Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Previous Numbers Published Were Inaccurate</p>
<p>Total Will Reach 200 Million</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the direct and indirect losses suffered by Shanghai from the January 28th Incident are difficult to quantify. Liu Dajun, former Director of the National Government's Bureau of Statistics, attempted to investigate the total losses, estimating them at 140 million. However, according to statistics now obtained by the Central Government, the losses in Shanghai exceed this figure. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Ministry of Industry's Bureau of Trade, the Accountants' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and four other agencies have been instructed to continue the investigation. A reporter visited the Bureau of Trade yesterday to inquire. According to the response, they have indeed received instructions from the Ministry of Industry to investigate the losses from the Shanghai Incident, but they are still in the process of investigation and cannot provide a definitive answer at this time. However, according to information obtained from other sources, the losses from the Shanghai Incident certainly exceed 140 million, and the total will likely be over 200 million.</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Telegram</h3>
<p>Wu Huanzhang, representing Ma, sent a letter to the association yesterday, along with a telegram from the Northeast, which reads: "We recently received a telegram from Chairman Ma, stating that previous battles have been reported. After issuing the general attack order in October of last year, he personally supervised the troops in attacking Laha Station, Tai'an Town, Keshan, and other places. After besieging them for over a month, they ultimately ran out of ammunition and food, enemy reinforcements arrived repeatedly, and a large number of Mongolian bandits aided the enemy, resulting in the destruction of several brigades of our army. Considering that there was no source of ammunition and food was scarce, in order to preserve strength and hope for future battles, he ordered the troops on the Qi-Ke and Hu-Hai lines to march west in sequence, hoping to link up with the Soviet army. Upon reaching Yalu County, they encountered the Japanese attack on the Soviets. The situation prevented further progress. He then ordered Brigade Commander Bu Binshan, who also served as Acting Commander of the 1st Army, to lead his troops through the Solun Mountains in Mongolia towards Rehe. At the same time, he also instructed Army Commanders Deng Wen and Tan Zixin to follow the route of Bu's army's retreat. Upon reaching Rehe territory, the army commanders were to report directly, requesting instructions on a location for rest and recuperation. Zhanshan will take a route through Europe to present the cruel situation of the violent Japanese to the League of Nations, which will take about a month before returning to the country. However, the lost territory has not been recovered, failing in my duty. Feeling deep shame, I pledge that as long as I, Shan, have a breath left, I will not change my original intentions. The officers and soldiers of my troops have all fought bloody battles, sharing hatred for the enemy. With one heart, they vow to lead their troops back to Longsha for a long-term resistance in hopes of a final victory. We hope that all patriotic individuals will provide full assistance to achieve complete success, etc. In recent days, we have also received telegrams from Bu Binshan, Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, Tan Zixin, and others from [illegible], stating that they have all led their troops to Rehe territory. However, after a long journey, they have endured harsh conditions and have reached the limit of their endurance. Ammunition, food, and clothing are severely lacking. We urgently request assistance to enable reorganization and continued resistance against the enemy. After enduring countless hardships, the troops under Chairman Ma have arrived in Rehe. According to statistics, there are still over 40,000 officers and soldiers. The desolate border is in dire need. In addition to sending personnel with funds to express condolences, we earnestly hope that you will report the situation of Ma's army to various groups and patriotic individuals at home and abroad, seeking their assistance so that the patriotic heroes can renew their righteous indignation. The fate of survival or demise is in the hands of our fellow countrymen."</p>
<h3>Li Zhongyi Pleads for Assistance</h3>
<p>The association also received a telegram from a certain leader of the volunteers, which reads, "(Official Title Omitted) Li Zhongyi, Commander of the 8th Army Corps, respectfully states (24th day) that due to the departure of Ma and Su to other countries, and the exhaustion of ammunition, it was unavoidable to select 27,000 elite cavalry and infantry to arrive in villages north of [illegible]. However, [illegible] is extremely poor, and there is no way to provide for the people and horses. With the enemy in front of us, hunger and cold are pressing. We earnestly request that the Central Government and patriotic compatriots at home and abroad quickly raise funds to provide food, ammunition, which is currently urgently needed. We request your instructions on how to proceed. After Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen left, the ammunition of this unit was extremely difficult to obtain. Apart from moving east for nearby replenishment, there is no way to survive. Our place is weak, so what can we do? After thinking it over, we can only send a telegram to you, hoping that you will provide assistance to show comfort and also request a reply."</p>
<h3>Support Association Provides Assistance</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegrams, the Volunteer Army Support Association submitted them to the 98th Standing Council Meeting yesterday for discussion and resolution. (A) Allocate 10,000 yuan in national currency; (B) Allocate 300,000 rounds of ammunition; (C) Send a letter to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, seeking ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Increased Airmail Rates</h3>
<p>Effective February 1st</p>
<p>Increase of 10 Cents per 1,000 Kilometers</p>
<p>No Increase for Newspapers and Printed Matter</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the China National Aviation Corporation announced that, in order to compensate for losses, it has decided to slightly increase airmail rates starting on February 1st. The standard is an increase of 10 cents per 1,000 kilometers. For example, Shanghai to Beiping is over 1,300 kilometers, so in addition to the original price of 15 cents, another 10 cents will be added, for a total of 25 cents. However, there will be no increase for newspapers and printed matter. The Shanghai-Beiping and Shanghai-Hankou routes will increase prices simultaneously.</p>
<p>Yesterday Was Communist Commemoration Day</p>
<h3>Temporary Strengthening of Security</h3>
<p>Prohibition of Parades and Gatherings, Peaceful Evening</p>
<p>Yesterday was the January 18th Communist Party Unemployed Workers' Commemoration Day. The police authorities in the Chinese and Foreign Concessions strengthened security temporarily to prevent any Communist Party actions, prohibiting parades and gatherings. Fortunately, the evening was peaceful.</p>
<h3>Strict Security</h3>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, received prior notice that the Communist Party was inciting unemployed workers to petition party and government agencies under the guise of seeking relief, actually intending to cause chaos related to local public security. To prevent this, he specifically ordered the police stations, inspection offices, and detective teams in each district to strictly guard against gatherings, parades, and strikes. Yesterday, all major roads in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Huxi were doubly guarded. Inspectors and detectives were divided into shifts for deployment. The police battalion and patrol car team were dispatched to patrol. The police force of the French Concession and the Public Concession were ordered to deploy Chinese and foreign detectives in the worker areas of Hudong and Huxi and at major roads bordering the Chinese Concessions to provide security.</p>
<h3>Passed Peacefully</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched a squad of police officers and armed policemen to the Nanshi Nanshi Social Bureau and the Ximen Lin Yin Road Municipal Party Headquarters, together with inspectors Zheng Renquan, Guo Liangzhen, and others to guard the sites. The Municipal Government was guarded by soldiers from the Security Battalion, with particularly strict security. Anti-government slogans written in chalk were discovered on the streets of Huxi and Hudong. The police authorities seized anti-government propaganda. Fortunately, no incidents occurred yesterday because of the heavy snowfall. The security guards were withdrawn in the evening, and the night was peaceful.</p>
<h3>India Bans Silver Imports</h3>
<p>Fortunately, No Smuggling in the Mail</p>
<p>Violators Will Have Their Goods Confiscated</p>
<p>According to the local postal authorities, the Indian government is now banning the import of (1) silver = counterfeit coins (not used by the Indian government) and (2) silver bullion not imported from Manwyne (Cheng Sanxi) and Sansi from China directly to Burma (Burma) by land. If such prohibited items are found in the mail in the future, the Indian postal authorities will confiscate them.</p>
<p>Before the Final Closing</p>
<h3>Exemption from Stamp Tax on Account Books</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Empathizes with Business Difficulties</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously received letters from chambers of commerce in various locations stating that the deadline for final closing of accounts for stores has been set at the end of January. The stamp tax on account books should be affixed after the end of January. However, the local stamp tax bureaus notified that the tax should be affixed starting on January 1, 22nd year, which would increase the burden on merchants and residents. They requested that the matter be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval to follow the old practice. After learning of the situation, the federation telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request approval. Yesterday, they received a reply, which reads: "Telegram from Weidai received. The stamp tax on account books has been determined by the Ministry of Finance to follow the standard of the beginning and end dates of the year. Regardless of the date of establishing the account, the validity of the stamp tax should be until the end of the year. This has been communicated to all provincial bureaus for compliance. It is stated that the final closing of accounts for businesses has been set for the end of January each year, and new account books used by stores are also replaced after the final closing. Please order the provinces to ensure that stamp tax on account books should be replaced starting on February 1st. This is true. To show special empathy, if stores continue to use old account books from the previous year and have already affixed sufficient stamp tax in accordance with regulations on January 1st of this year, they do not need to affix more tax when continuing to use them after the final closing on February 1st. If new account books are replaced after the final closing and have been affixed with sufficient stamp tax, then for the old account books from the previous year, even if they contain entries from January 1st to February 1st of the 22nd year before the final closing, they may be exempted from stamp tax. If new books are not replaced and the old account books from the previous year are continued to be used to record accounts for this year after February 1st, stamp tax should still be affixed in accordance with the usual regulations for newly established accounts. In addition to notifying all provincial bureaus for compliance, please check and inform accordingly, Ministry of Finance Zheng Xiao Yin," and so on. After receiving the telegram, the federation has telegraphed it to all provincial federations of commerce for their information and notification to various chambers of commerce.</p>
<h3>3 Million Jiangzhe Silk Industry Bonds</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Orders Bank of China to Allocate Funds</p>
<p>The silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has recently been encroached upon by foreign goods. Overseas markets have been completely lost. For example, eighteen silk factories in this city have suspended operations. In order to provide relief, the government has issued 3 million yuan in short-term Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bonds for the 21st year, to be used as relief for the silk industry in the two provinces. Yesterday, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, which reads: "To the Jiangzhe Chen Factory Silk Promotion Committee and the Jiangzhe Chen Factory Silk Cocoon Reorganization Committee at 578 Shanxi Road, Shanghai, Greetings. Telegram received. 3 million yuan in short-term Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bonds for the 21st year was approved by telegram to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to be collected by the bond fund custodian committee [润卿 叶琢堂]. Another telegram has been sent to the Shanghai Bank of China for issuance. Please inform accordingly, Ministry of Finance Song."</p>

<p>Ship Accident on Yangtze River on a Snowy Night</p>
<h3>Collision Between Fulong and Tonghe</h3>
<p>Losses Exceed 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The weather has been severely cold and snowy for days. A collision occurred between the Fulong and Tonghe ships on the Yangtze River, resulting in significant losses. Our reporter made a special trip to various places for detailed investigation, as follows:</p>
<h3>Two Ships Travel on One Line on a Snowy Night</h3>
<p>On the 13th of this month, the Three-North Company's Yangtze River ship, the Fulong, sailed from Shanghai to Hankou, carrying a large number of goods and passengers. After leaving the Wusong Estuary, it started snowing heavily. The Fulong passed Zhenjiang at 3:00 AM on the 14th. At the same time, the Hefeng Steamship Company's Tonghe ship, carrying 1,600 tons of coal from Pukou to Shanghai, also arrived at the Yangtze River surface about two nautical miles upstream of Zhenjiang at 3:00 AM on the 14th. Due to the heavy snowfall, the Yangtze River surface was obscured. The Fulong and Tonghe ships entered the same route without realizing it.</p>
<h3>Two Ships Collide, Suffering Heavy Damage</h3>
<p>The Fulong was heading upstream, and the Tonghe was heading downstream. The two ships could not distinguish each other in the snowy night. When they approached each other, both sides began to honk, but they were surprised and wanted to yield but it was too late. The bow of the Tonghe crashed violently into the middle cabin of the Fulong. Both ships were heavily loaded, so after the violent collision, the large cabin of the Fulong immediately broke open, and river water rushed in, submerging the goods. Passengers all took refuge in the front and rear cabins. The bow of the Tonghe was also completely destroyed, and a large iron anchor was lost.</p>
<h3>Tonghe Has Been Sent to Shanghai for Major Repairs</h3>
<p>After the accident, the Tonghe immediately rushed to Shanghai to unload the coal and undergo major repairs at the Yiesong Factory in Dongjiadu. The Three-North's Fulong was extremely dangerous after being hit. The shipowner ordered it to rush to Nanjing to unload the goods from each cabin, and the passengers were ordered to disembark in Nanjing. Because the ship was about to sink, it could not go to Hankou again. The Shanghai Bureau was notified to find a way to tow the ship back to Shanghai. The damage to the water-soaked goods was enormous. It did not arrive in Shanghai until yesterday afternoon. Passengers and cargo in Nanjing were transferred to other ships to go to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Loss Numbers Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Hefeng and Three-North steamship companies jointly reported to the Maritime Affairs Bureau, requesting Director He Hanlan to send technicians to the two ships to inspect the damage and investigate the responsibility for the accident. The inspection site was at the old shipyard in Dongjiadu. However, due to heavy snow and the fact that the Fulong had not yet arrived, the Maritime Affairs Bureau decided to reschedule the inspection to Dongjiadu this morning. It is reported that the losses from the collision will exceed 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Huang Naishu Discusses</p>
<h3>Rumors of Rebellion and Seizure of Shanhaiguan Post Office Are Untrue</h3>
<p>The Post Office Lost 2 Million Yuan Last Year</p>
<p>Actively Laying Off Employees to Make Up the Loss</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday's report from Nanjing stated that the Japanese instigated a puppet organization to seize our Shanhaiguan Post Office. Although repeatedly resisted, the situation is very dangerous. A reporter visited Huang Naishu, Director of the Directorate General of Posts, to inquire about the details. According to him, reports received so far indicate that the situation is normal and there have been no changes. It is impossible to predict whether there will be any changes in the near future. The exchange of mail there still maintains the original postal routes and delivery is uninterrupted. Mail from outside the pass has not been delivered since we blockaded postal services in the Northeast. However, mail forwarded from Dalian cannot be refused because it is restricted by the Sino-Japanese Postal Reciprocal Agreement. However, if any mail is found to have affixed [puppet state] stamps, it will be delivered as underpaid. Director Huang also said that the Post Office suffered a huge loss of 2 million yuan due to the Shenyang Incident. They are now actively laying off employees to make up for the loss, so they are revising the retirement pay and pension regulations to show consideration. Currently, about a thousand people have requested retirement from various bureaus across the country, and most have already left their jobs. Most of those who retired are middle and lower-level employees. Some senior employees have also retired due to old age. According to current calculations, approximately one million yuan in expenses can be saved per year.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department Reorganizes Taxation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department has recently organized a Tax Design Committee to conduct research on the revision of various tax regulations and the reform of tax administration in order to effectively reorganize taxation. The organization regulations of the committee have been approved by the Ministry of Finance. In addition to Xie Qi, Director of the Taxation Department, serving as the ex officio chairman of the Tax Design Committee, two standing committee members have also been appointed by Xie: Zeng Yaowu and An Zhenpeng. A number of committee members will be appointed from the department's secretary section chiefs and technical experts. The director and deputy director of the Shanghai District General Taxation Bureau, as well as the director and deputy director of the Stamp Tax Bureau, will also be ex officio members. It is stipulated that a meeting will be held every Wednesday to discuss progress.</p>

<p>The Rear Area Council of the National Crisis Relief Corps, in order to establish a wounded soldiers' hospital in Beiping, previously resolved to send Director Ouyang Huizhen as a representative to the United States to raise funds from overseas Chinese. It is now learned that Director Ouyang departed for the United States by ship on the 10th. Yesterday, the Council held its 19th Standing Committee meeting.

The following resolutions were then made: (1) Recruit new team members quickly in the North to work locally; (2) The fourth phase of funding and reserve funds will be remitted immediately to facilitate work; (3) The fifth phase of work will be extended to mid-July. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>Muslims</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for An Dexin Today</h3>
<p>Since Battalion Commander An Dexin, a Muslim, died in the Battle of Yuguan, Muslims throughout the country have been mourning him. Upon hearing the news, Muslims in this city immediately began preparing for a memorial service. It has now been decided to hold a memorial service for Battalion Commander An Dexin at 9:00 a.m. today at the Qinglian Street Mosque in the city. The memorial ceremony will be quite solemn.</p>
<p>Two Exchanges</p>
<h3>Merger of Exchanges</h3>
<p>The Three-Year Extension is About to Expire</p>
<p>Previously, the central authorities noted that there were two exchanges in Shanghai engaged in the securities business: the Shanghai Goods and Securities Exchange and the Chinese Business Securities Exchange. This led to discrepancies in securities market prices within the same area. Therefore, during the time when the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had not yet been reorganized into the Ministry of Industry, Minister Kong Xiangxi and Minister of Finance Song Ziwen separately ordered the two exchanges to merge. Later, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was reorganized into the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance established an Exchange Supervision Office in Shanghai to oversee the merger of the two exchanges. However, the authorities of the two exchanges held differing opinions regarding the merger. The Ministries of Finance and Industry then granted a three-year extension for discussion during this period. The three-year period will expire at the end of June of this year. Currently, the two exchanges have not yet begun negotiations regarding the merger issue.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Russian Timber Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Huadong News Agency) Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, commercial transportation between the two countries has become active.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Held Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Financial Issues</p>
<p>Funatsu Assumes Position as Japanese Director</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement held a regular board meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:30 to discuss financial and other general matters. At the same time, the new Japanese Director Funatsu formally assumed the position of Japanese Director, succeeding the previous Director Terai, who resigned due to illness. The outcome of the meeting, in addition to the work report of the Health Department which has already been published, is that financial matters will be released after review in the next day or two. However, it is understood that the financial issues discussed yesterday were only the final accounts from before September of last year. The accounts from September onwards have not yet been finalized and therefore could not be discussed. The Board's discussion of these issues is to prepare for reference to various tax revenues in order to study the new budget proposal for this year. According to the regulations, the budget must first be drafted separately by each department, considered by the authorities, and then compiled into a general budget by the Finance Department, before being submitted to the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting for discussion and approval. Therefore, this budget proposal must be drafted before April of this year so that it can be submitted to the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting convened in early April for discussion. It is now learned that the Municipal Council will become increasingly busy hereafter, as the board re-election and annual meeting are both approaching.</p>

<h3>Yin Xing Municipal Committee</h3>
<h3>Please Provide Relief to War Zone Refugees</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Letter to the Xinwei Relief Society</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, Zhang Huabang, Yin Xing, Jiangwan and other places bore the brunt of the attack and were heavily devastated by Japanese artillery fire. Collapsed walls and broken walls have not yet been restored. Recently, as the severe winter has arrived, the plight of the refugees who have lost their clothes and food is particularly dire. Yesterday, Yang Yiqian and others of the Yin Xing District Municipal Committee sent a letter to the Xinwei Relief Society, hoping that they would find ways to provide relief to benefit the refugees. The original letter is excerpted below: (Omitted above) The northwestern part of our district, such as Zhang Huabang, Zhaojia Bang, Tangjia Bridge, etc., connects Jiangwan in the south, Wusong in the north, and is connected in between. It was the first to be devastated by the Japanese army, and the collection of wood and ruined walls is unbearable. Just because it is located in a remote and bad place, it has not been able to invite the gentlemen of your society to open their minds. At this time, it is severe cold, and there are indeed many people without clothes and rice. Our colleagues are too busy to save themselves, and we have exhausted our efforts to help. We have repeatedly appealed, fearing that our reputation is not high enough to move your clear hearing. That is why we would rather suffer the accusations of the victims and dare not say a word. Now, after careful consideration by our office, if we remain silent, then your society's benevolence will not be universal, and it will become a stain on your kindness. Therefore, we specially venture to make our statement, hoping that you will approve it and provide relief. We will be infinitely grateful.</p>
<h3>Hubei Public Association Asks for Relief in Hubei</h3>
<p>The Hubei Public Association of this city previously requested relief from the Yuwan'e Relief Association on behalf of the disaster victims in Hubei. It sent letters to various disaster-stricken counties in Hubei to investigate the truth of the disaster areas, hoping that the disaster victims would benefit from the Association's kindness. The Association recently received letters from various counties in Hubei like snowflakes, so it compiled a statistical table of the disaster areas in Hubei, and attached the original letters and tables to report to the Relief Association, asking it to show great compassion and provide relief as soon as possible, so as to avoid the disaster victims' expectations in the midst of cold and hunger. At the same time, it sent representatives to state everything, which shows that the Association cares about the disaster victims and benefits the local community, which is no small matter. The original letter is copied as follows: Dear Sirs, Our Association previously organized a disaster area investigation committee to investigate the disaster situation in Hubei counties. We sent letters to the Hubei Provincial Government, county governments, and public groups, and sent with the letters a pre-made disaster area investigation table prepared by our Association, asking them to investigate nearby, fill out the table and send it to our Association, so that we can request relief from your Association based on the accurate disaster situation in each county. Now we have received successive replies and completed disaster area investigation tables from the Hubei Provincial Government and 15 counties such as Hanchuan. Check, our province has long been ravaged by bandits since the 17th year, and suffered from floods the year before, the disaster area is actually wider than other provinces, and the disaster situation is more tragic than other provinces, water bandits are dependent on each other, evolving into an unprecedented catastrophe, so that people are displaced and ten rooms are nine empty, if we do not urgently seek relief, then the timid people have no hope of revival, and the stubborn people have the possibility of taking risks. If we want to seek political facilities and rural recovery, we must first appease the refugees and stabilize. Otherwise, social order and rural production will inevitably be gradually broken and out of control. We have always admired the gentlemen of your Association for their benevolence and righteousness, and their concern for drowning. They have saved countless lives by providing relief to disaster victims over the years. We admire them beyond words. Now, we have recompiled a statistical table of the disaster areas in Hubei counties based on the disaster area investigation tables of each county in our province, which is attached with the letter for your immediate reference. The survey tables that continue to arrive will be transferred later. We specially send representatives Chen Rongcai and Hua Ziguto to bring the original letters and tables of the Hubei Provincial Government and various counties to state everything in person. We urge you to grant us an audience, and ask you to show great compassion, considering the particularly severe disaster situation in our province, and quickly allocate relief funds, which will be sent directly to the people's organizations in each verified disaster area, so that the disaster victims can benefit from the actual benefits, and meet the public's lofty aspirations to save the country and save the people.</p>

Employees who have been working for more than one year will receive a severance payment of one month's salary in addition to their salary. The list of layoffs has been submitted to the general affairs section for announcement.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Jiang Guili Expelled from Japan</h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese Jiang Guili is a native of Xinghua, Fujian. He used to do business in Japan, so his eldest son studied in Japan and his second son ran a business in Japan. This time, Jiang came to Shanghai from Fujian and bought a passenger seat on the Ikoma Maru from the Japanese Mail Company to go to Japan. When he landed in Moji, he was detained by the Japanese water police, who said that he had no permit and was not allowed to land. He was detained in the police station and yesterday he was ordered to take the Asou Maru back to Shanghai. Although Jiang repeatedly stated that his son had a shop in Japan, the Japanese police did not allow him to enter the country. Yesterday he was deported. Jiang was over fifty years old and was very embarrassed by this humiliation. The Japanese Mail Company also demanded payment for the ticket.</p>
<p>Wusong Ship Workers' Strike</p>
<h3>Zhang Chunhua and Hu Henian Detained</h3>
<p>Representatives of Middle Class of River and Sea Vessels Please Investigate Strictly</p>
<p>Since the British company Taikoo used force to expel the middle class workers of the Wusong ship, the party and government agencies have repeatedly ordered the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association to be responsible for restoring the work of the workers, but there is no suitable solution. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Wusong Ship Remains in Hankou</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Wusong ship was originally said to return to Shanghai yesterday. The middle class workers had a resolution to work on the ship when it arrived in Shanghai. However, as of 6:00 p.m., it had not yet arrived in port. According to the Wuda ship that came to Shanghai from Hankou, the Wusong ship was still docked in Hankou and had not yet departed. The reason is unknown.</p>
<h3>Contacting for Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>Because the Wusong ship arrived in port this afternoon, and the workers are concerned that the workers working on the ship may cause major obstacles, Lyu Shuangxi and Wang Youming were specially sent to the Social Bureau at 11:00 a.m. to ask for instructions. Director Wang Xianqing of the Mediation Section met with them. At 3:00 p.m., they met with representatives from the Municipal Party Department to openly discuss the Mutual Aid Association. At 3:00 p.m., Wang Xianqing from the Social Bureau and officials from the Municipal Party Department went to the Mutual Aid Association to discuss the resumption of work. As a result, the Mutual Aid Association was ordered to send representatives to the company to discuss the resumption of work.</p>
<h3>Support Meeting</h3>
<p>The Support Association for the Wusong Ship Tragedy held its sixth regular meeting at the Middle Class Public Office at 26 Old Church Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. Sixty-two representatives from various ships attended. Chairman Zhou Xiaoting presided over the meeting. The chairman first reported, and then the discussion began. It was resolved that: (1) Since the Wusong ship has not arrived in port today, the sailors in Hankou should be telegraphed to prepare to work on the ship; (2) Since the association's funds are insufficient, fundraising teams should be sent to various ships to raise donations.</p>
<h3>Two Compradors Detained</h3>
<p>The Middle Class Public Office received a telegram from the Hankou Seamen's Association yesterday, saying: Dear Middle Class Public Office, the Association led various representatives to petition the municipal government, and the mayor agreed to send the two compradors who had benefited, Zhang Chunhua and accountant Hu Henian, to Shanghai on the Changxing ship to be investigated by the municipal government. We hope you will conduct a strict investigation. Greetings from the Hankou Association.</p>

<h3>Teahouse Workers Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Demanding Immediate Telegraph from Railway Bureau to Stop Bidding</p>
<p>The teahouse workers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway recently petitioned the Railway Bureau to oppose the bidding for the contracting of teahouses, but they did not get the results they wanted, which led to serious disputes. The workers are panicked because the bidding is scheduled to open on the 30th (tomorrow). They have sent representatives to Beijing to petition the central government and the Ministry of Railways. Their representatives, Sun Wenkou and Lu Yisheng, took the overnight express train to Beijing to petition the Central People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Railways, demanding an urgent telegram to the two railway administrations to stop the bidding, and to always maintain the workers' right to preferential contracting, so that the contracting system will never be revived and the workers' livelihood will be maintained.</p>

<h3>Jewelry Store Robbed on Avenue Dubail</h3>

<h3>Impressions in the Snow</h3>
<p>The streets are covered with thick snow,</p>
<p>Affecting water and land transportation.</p>
<p>The weather has been severely cold recently, with snow falling and thick fog obscuring vision. Shipping and aviation have been suspended as a result. Heavy snow fell yesterday morning and continued throughout the day. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>A White Expanse</h3>
<p>For the past week, Shanghai has experienced intermittent snowfall followed by wind and rain, making the weather exceptionally cold and unbearable. Even with a fire in the fireplace, one could barely feel warm. Yesterday afternoon at around 10 o'clock, the accumulated snow from previous days had not yet melted when heavy snow began to fall again, accompanied by piercing cold. In less than half an hour, the snow on the streets was several inches deep, turning pedestrians white. A panoramic view from a high vantage point revealed a white expanse in all directions, with the snow continuing to fall heavily and incessantly until late at night. According to experienced farmers, such auspicious snow indicates a bountiful harvest next spring.</p>
<h3>Train Delays</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways have been experiencing delays due to the severe cold and thick snow accumulation on the tracks. Drivers are facing difficulties. According to Zheng Baozhao, the Traffic Director of both railway administrations, the snow accumulation along the Beijing-Shanghai line has reached six to seven inches in the past three days. The railway lacks the comprehensive snow removal equipment of the northern regions and is currently instructing workers to spread yellow sand on the tracks to prevent slippage. The cold weather has caused delays in train services on both lines, but fortunately, the delays are not significant, averaging around twenty minutes.</p>
<h3>Ferry Service Suspended</h3>
<p>Continuous heavy snow has fallen in Shanghai, as well as in various regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, causing rivers to freeze and roads to become slippery. Train and boat schedules have been disrupted. Inland ferry services operated by companies such as Laogongmao, serving Changshu and Wuxi, have been suspended due to the icy rivers and inability for the boats to navigate. Services will resume once the rivers thaw. Services to Huzhou and Hangzhou continued from Shanghai yesterday, but were also hampered by the snowy conditions in those locations. Only the Qingpu and Pinghu lines maintained regular service, albeit at a slower pace due to the cold weather.</p>
<h3>Patrols in the Snow</h3>
<p>Heavy snow suddenly fell in Shanghai yesterday, starting at 9:00 AM and continuing into the evening. The streets were covered in white, with more than an inch of accumulated snow and few pedestrians. However, Director Wen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recognizing the anniversary of the unemployed workers demonstration by the Communist Party, ordered the supervisory division to dispatch inspectors, accompanied by the chiefs of each district police station, to patrol key areas to prevent reactionary elements from taking advantage of the situation to disrupt public order. Additional patrol teams were dispatched to patrol the areas of Xiaodongmen, Shiliupu, Laoximen, Xinqiao Street, Fangbang Bridge, and Gaochang Temple in the Nanshi first and second districts and their respective branches. However, the evening remained peaceful.</p>
<h3>Preserving Life</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th), at around 10:00 AM, as rain and snow were falling, a young man named A, approximately twenty years old, wearing an overcoat and fur robe, was walking alone along the tram tracks on Min’guo Road. As he reached the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street, a China Merchant Line 3 tram approached. The young man attempted to avoid the tram, but the corner of his overcoat and fur robe became caught in the tram's iron gate, causing him to be dragged along for three or four storefronts. Fortunately, the ticket collector noticed and, in addition to grabbing the young man's collar to prevent him from falling, quickly rang the bell to stop the tram. The young man's life was saved, but his overcoat and fur robe were torn and he was covered in mud, appearing disheveled.</p>
<p>The Xinningtai Ship Sinks</p>
<h3>Missionary Woven Dies</h3>
<p>The Continental Press reports that the Shanghai Inland Mission received a telegram from Ningbo confirming the death of their missionary, Woven, in the sinking of the Xinningtai ship. The missionary was only twenty-seven years old and had come to China from England in 1931 to serve with the China Inland Mission. He was traveling from Haimen to Ningbo on the Xinningtai, intending to take up a post in Yin County. Tragically, the ship encountered a storm and sank last Friday, resulting in the drowning of all aboard. However, the mission is continuing to investigate, hoping that Woven may have been rescued.</p>
<p>Central District</p>
<h3>Construction of Municipal Hospital</h3>
<p>One Million Yuan Budget, Site Over 87 Mu</p>
<p>Approved by the 226th Municipal Council Meeting</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Shanghai has long lacked a well-equipped municipal hospital within its city limits, a deficiency deeply regretted by the city's common people. Recognizing this need, the municipal government has decided to establish a large-scale, well-equipped municipal hospital to benefit its citizens. This plan was decided upon by the municipal council long ago, but has been delayed due to a lack of funding. It is now known that the municipal government has decided to allocate one million yuan from the war zone reconstruction public bond to build the municipal hospital. The construction plan is being planned by the Municipal Health Bureau. The site has been determined to be in the central district, north of the Yangjing area, east of Funan Zuo Road, south of Fudong Outer Road, and west of Huayuan Road, occupying an area of over 87 mu. The Municipal Health Bureau has already informed the Central District Construction Committee that the site should be reserved. The committee has submitted a request to the municipal government, which was approved at the 226th Municipal Council meeting.</p>
<p>Sixteen-Year-Old Boy</p>
<h3>Forcibly Defiles Nine-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>The Decline of Morality is Evident Here</p>
<p>Reduced Sentence to Three Years and Six Months</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank Building at 374 Jiangxi Road, in addition to renting out offices to lawyers, also rents out commercial space and residential apartments. Yao Yongkang rents room 47 on the fifth floor, where he runs a tailoring shop. A Westerner rents room 23 as a residence, and that Westerner employs Lin Asi from Yangzhou as a cook. Lin's wife, Huang, and nine-year-old daughter, Gendi, live there as well, so Gendi often visits room 47 to play. One afternoon, Gendi went to room 47 to play. Yao Yongkang was not present, only Zhou Guilin was inside. When Zhou saw the girl, he was suddenly overcome by lust. He knocked the girl to the ground, covered her mouth to prevent her from calling out, and stripped her of her clothes before raping her. Afterward, he forbade her from telling her parents. After being raped, Gendi returned to her room and washed her lower body. Her mother, Huang, noticed bloodstains on the girl's trousers and suspected something was wrong. She questioned her daughter thoroughly, and the girl eventually told the truth. Huang informed Lin Asi, who reported it to the General Police Station. Detective Liang Shiwei was dispatched to arrest Zhou and take him back to the police station. The girl was sent to the hospital for examination, which confirmed the assault. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the First Special Court, Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi charged him with rape under Articles 240, sections 1 and 2 of the criminal code, stating that the defendant had confessed to the crime at the police station and requesting prosecution. According to Lin Gendi's testimony, "Yesterday I was playing on the escalator when the defendant hugged me into the room, took off my trousers, and covered my mouth when I tried to scream, preventing me from calling out. Then he raped me on the floor and told me not to tell my mother." When questioned, Zhou Guilin, stated, "I am sixteen years old, born on December 28th. I didn't force Lin's daughter. I just wanted to have some fun, which led to this. I regret it immensely. My parents are real. I hope the court will be lenient because I was momentarily blinded by passion." Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that the defendant's actions were inexcusable, but because he was underage, he might be granted leniency with a reduced sentence. The court appointed lawyer Zheng Wenkai to defend the defendant pro bono. Zheng argued, "This case may not require legal research, but the defendant is young and lacks legal knowledge. Even common sense is lacking, so I request that the court show leniency in law and grant him a chance for rehabilitation." Judge Feng Shide concluded the arguments and sentenced Zhou Guilin to a reduced sentence of three and a half years of imprisonment for rape as a warning.</p>
<p>Domestic Light Bulb Industry</p>
<h3>Requesting the Government to Ban the Dumping of Japanese Bulbs</h3>
<p>Representative Hu Xiyuan Petitions</p>
<p>More than ten domestic light bulb manufacturers, including China Apuer Electrical Factory, Yaerden, Huatong, and Dahua, have been impacted by the recent sharp drop in the Japanese exchange rate, which has resulted in a large-scale dumping of Japanese light bulbs in China at exceptionally low prices due to stockpiling policies. Ordinary Japanese bulbs are sold to Chinese retailers for just over one dime, and recently even at nine cents. The lowest cost for domestic light bulbs is at least sixteen cents or more. More refined products cost around seventeen or eighteen cents. Some individuals, lacking a sense of national identity and motivated solely by profit, are importing large quantities of Japanese bulbs and rebranding them as German or domestic brands to deceive the public and sell them at inflated prices. Statistics show that Shanghai imports no less than 600,000 Japanese bulbs per month, disrupting market prices and making it impossible for newer domestic light bulb brands to compete, hindering their ability to sustain themselves. Even established domestic light bulb brands are significantly impacted. The manufacturers jointly discussed this matter the day before and decided to petition the government to ban the dumping of Japanese bulbs. They have appointed Hu Xiyuan as their representative to travel to Beijing last night by express train to petition the government.</p>

<h3>1933 New Calendar</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs publishes a new calendar every year, which includes a comprehensive collection of information such as seasonal tables, longitude and latitude coordinates, age conversion tables, and a list of important seasonal diseases. The quality of the printing is excellent. Government agencies and schools throughout the country pre-order copies from the bureau. Each print run of ten thousand copies sells out quickly. Recognizing the shortage of copies in previous years, the bureau has increased the print run of the 1933 calendar by five thousand copies to ensure wider distribution. The calendar sells for ten cents each. All government agencies and organizations nationwide can request a complimentary copy by sending a letter with five cents for postage to the bureau's book department.</p>
<p>Luodian Town</p>
<h3>Murder for Profit Occurs</h3>
<p>The Elderly Woman's Death is Horrific</p>
<p>On January 15th, at around 6:00 PM, Zhang Zhao, a 65-year-old widow who lived alone in Zhangjia Bridge North, was found murdered in the firewood shed next to her stove. She was robbed of a pair of gold earrings and two silver dollars. Zhang Zhao used to work as a servant and had an adopted nephew working in Shanghai. Her family was poor. On that day, her nephew brought back two silver dollars from Shanghai, which were seen by Zhang Ayuan, a boatman from the north side of the bridge. Zhang Ayuan then developed evil intentions. Under the cover of darkness, he went to Zhang Zhao's house while she was cooking dinner. Zhang Ayuan forcefully stole the silver dollars. When Zhao shouted, Ayuan repeatedly struck Zhao's head and face five or six times with a large, old brick, killing her instantly. Her right eyeball was also knocked out, making the scene particularly gruesome. The murderer then escaped from the back window and went home, where he changed out of his bloody clothes and went to sleep. After the incident, the town's public security bureau dispatched Patrol Chief Xu Dengchao and his officers to conduct a thorough investigation. Within a few hours, the murderer was apprehended and the stolen goods recovered. Bureau Chief Gong Ruo Yao has completed the preliminary interrogation of the suspect, who confessed to the crime. He has now been handed over to the Baoshan County government for legal punishment.</p>
<p>Gangsters Extort 10,000 from Foreman</p>
<h3>Detectives Disguise Themselves as Negotiators</h3>
<p>Multiple Male and Female Gang Members Arrested</p>
<p>Zhang Quanfa, the son of local resident Zhang Huanzhong, who resides at 436 Chaoyang Road in Yangshupu, works as a foreman at the Public Works Bureau and has accumulated some savings. He was targeted by gangsters. Between November 13th of last year and January 17th of this year, he received four anonymous threatening letters demanding 10,000 yuan. The last letter instructed him to meet near the British-American Tobacco Company lot near Kunming Road and Huasheng Road at 8:00 AM the previous morning. The negotiator was to carry a blue cloth shirt as a signal. Zhang Huanzhong reported the situation to the Yangshupu Police Station, who dispatched Chinese Detective Yang A’quan, Liu Wenzao, and detectives Shen Yuzhou, Yin Zhanqing, and Chen Youling, disguised as street workers, along with Zhang Huanzhong, to wait at the designated location. After some time, Wen Leichun from Jiangbei, approached them and asked Zhang how much money he had brought. Zhang replied that he had not brought any yet. Wen angrily said, "Come with me to the headquarters to negotiate." The detectives immediately rushed forward and arrested him. They also arrested accomplices Wang Desheng, Wang Tingjian, Wen Binzhen, Chen Weilou, Liu Wang, Wang Wei, Wen Shen, and Xu Peng, totaling nine people, at 84 Wufuli and 213 Xinxinli on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, and 81 Xinxinli. They were all taken into custody at the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the facts of the case, stating that the first letter, demanding 20,000 yuan, was sent to Zhang Huanchong's married daughter, Zhang Gengda, at 1385 Sanyi Lane on Yangshupu Road, asking her to pass it on. The second letter was sent directly to 436 Chaoyang Road, reducing the demand to 10,000 yuan. The third letter was also sent to Sanyi Lane. Wen Leichun, the first defendant, personally delivered the fourth letter to Zhang Huanchong at the back door on the morning of the 16th, threatening him with a handgun and arranging a meeting for the next day on Chaoyang Road. The accomplices had also gone to the victim's house, knocked on the door, and fired three shots to intimidate him. Wang Desheng, the second defendant, stood at a distance as a lookout during the meeting yesterday. The case is being requested for a detailed investigation. The threatening letters and two bullet casings have been presented. Zhang Huanzhong testified to the events. When questioned, Wen Leichun's testimony was evasive. Wang Desheng claimed that he did not go to the location as a lookout yesterday. The remaining suspects claimed to have no knowledge of the threatening letters. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered each suspect to be detained separately for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>An Absurd Double Suicide Attempt Due to Forbidden Love</h3>
<p>丨Shi Shoudao's Enticement Crime Receives a Suspended Sentence丨</p>
<p>Previously, Shi Shoudao, a Chongming native working at the Yusheng Garden in Chenjiadu, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, fell in love with Fu Meizhen, a Ningbo woman from the nearby area. Despite their mutual affection, Shi was already married, and the woman was betrothed to another. Both sets of parents held firm to traditional family etiquette, preventing them from achieving their desired freedom. Between the 10th and 12th of this month, they opened a room at the Kunming Hotel, No. 35 Kunming Road, agreeing to commit suicide together, hoping to become husband and wife in the afterlife. They wrote a farewell letter and twice ingested opium, awaiting death. The hotel's tea servant discovered them and reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which sent detectives to the hospital, where both were saved. The police station charged Shi with enticement and instigation of suicide and filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court. After detailed investigation and deliberation, the court announced its verdict. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Shi Shoudao to six months of imprisonment for enticing a woman under twenty years old with the intent of lewdness, with a two-year suspended sentence. The number of days he was detained before the trial was converted into prison days at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment. He was found not guilty of the remaining charges. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested that he remain in custody during the appeal period, which the court granted.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance and Public Safety Bureaus announced yesterday:</p>
<h3>Regulations on Levying Donations from Entertainment Venues for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The implementation period is temporarily limited to six months.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance and Public Safety Bureaus issued Announcement No. 213 yesterday, stating that the announcement was jointly issued because of Instruction No. 4032 from the Municipal Government, which in turn was based on Instruction No. 5115 from the Executive Yuan, regarding the implementation of regulations. The announcement quoted a letter from the Political Council of the Central Executive Committee, stating: "Regarding the proposal by committee members Shi Ying, Zhu Jiahua, Ju Zheng, and Shao Yuanchong at the 332nd meeting of this council, stating that the Northeast has been occupied for over a year, and the people of our three provinces are groaning under the iron heel of the brutal Japanese invaders, lacking clothing and food, displaced and suffering beyond description. It is proposed that all provinces be instructed to add a 10% surcharge to the price of tickets at theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues as a disaster relief donation. These funds should be collected daily by the relevant local authorities and deposited in the Central Bank, its branches, or other financial institutions, and remitted to the Central Party Headquarters every half-month for distribution and relief. This is a national crisis, and the people of the whole country will surely enthusiastically contribute to allow the dying victims in the Northeast to barely survive. Is this feasible? Please make a decision." This was approved and resolved. The detailed measures and implementation date were to be determined by the Executive Yuan. The corresponding record was sent by letter, requesting compliance.

<p>Wusong Female Student</p>
<h3>Zheng Yuexian's Suicide</h3>
<p>A beautiful woman of twenty-eight</p>
<p>Sad and sentimental, she drowned herself at sea</p>
<p>Zheng Yuexian, a female student from Wusong, who recently lived in a church in Hongkou, suddenly had thoughts of ending her life. She took a train from Shanghai to Wusong and drowned herself at Paotaiwan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Zheng's Family Background</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng, a resident renting a house from the Xu family on Taixing Road in Wusong Town, had a modest background. Around 1917 or 1918, he co-invested with others to purchase hundreds of mu of sand fields at Gaoqiao Sand (aka Old Mouse Sand). Later, the sand was designated as an oil pool area, and the sand fields were valued. Zheng sold the sand fields and became a relatively well-off family. Zheng's</p>
<h3>Eldest Daughter Yuexian</h3>
<p>Was twenty-eight years old, with a beautiful appearance and natural intelligence. She was quiet and persistent. She previously studied at Wusong Women's School, where she excelled in all subjects. She was most adept at studying Chinese and Western languages. Last year, she was admitted to a church school in Hongkou. It is unknown what stimulated her, but she suddenly had thoughts of ending her life. On the afternoon of the 14th, she took the Songhu train from Tiantongan to the Songqi station and walked to the beach at Paotaiwan.</p>
<h3>Drowning Suicide</h3>
<p>It has been four hundred days, with no confirmed news of her survival and no body found. When her father found out, he searched everywhere without a trace and reported it to the Rescue Bureau and the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, as well as the Shanghai Water Police Station and other agencies, asking them to pay attention. The female student had short hair and was wearing a red wool crepe long qipao, black patent leather shoes, and silk stockings. The reason for her suicide is said to be that the female student went home for winter solstice vacation last year and stayed for two nights. After returning to school, she wrote a letter to her closest female friend (the daughter of her landlord, Xu), stating that the country was in turmoil, the eastern neighbor was aggressively invading, and she was so angry that she did not want to live. This letter was seen by Xu's father, who secretly told Zheng, her father. Zheng went to the school and earnestly advised her, seeing that she seemed to understand and returned home. He did not expect that her intention to commit suicide was already decided and that this tragedy would occur, which is incomprehensible and regrettable. However, there is also</p>
<h3>An Interesting Anecdote</h3>
<p>Yuexian had already set the date for her suicide in June of this year in her letter. Therefore, her father said to her, "Don't treat this terrible tragedy as child's play. How can there be a fixed date to commit suicide next June, and already tell your friends in the twelfth month of this year? Why don't you publish a notice in the newspaper beforehand so that all your relatives and daughters know?"</p>
<p>Yao Hongsheng's Spear Skills are Good</p>
<h3>Enemy Fires Six Shots but Fails to Hit</h3>
<p>A Sad Story... Wife Takes Advantage of Illness to Run Away</p>
<p>Friends are Loyal... Practicing Kung Fu Hard in the Charitable Hall</p>
<p>Yao Hongsheng, a Beiping native renting at No. 120 Taoyuanzhai, west of Huayuan Bridge in Pudong, was shot six times by someone around 6 p.m. on the 15th of this month. The assassination failed, and the suspected assailant has been arrested by the Third District Public Security Bureau. The ins and outs of the case are detailed below:</p>
<h3>Cohabitation Out of Love</h3>
<p>Yao is currently thirty-seven years old. In his youth, he served as a soldier in a military unit in Hangzhou. He gradually became familiar with the local residents and formed an unbreakable bond with a Hangzhou woman named Ye. At that time, Ms. Ye was only seventeen, in her prime, and not unattractive. The two became deeply in love. Yao left the military life and brought Ms. Ye to Shanghai, renting a house to live together, virtually as husband and wife. Later, Yao also took in a young girl named Caiyu (now thirteen years old) to live in his home, to be married to his nephew as a child bride. Yao is hardworking and frugal. A few years ago, he was introduced to work as a cook in the Third District Police Station of the Pudong Huatong Depot and gradually accumulated a considerable amount of savings, now amounting to no less than five or six thousand gold.</p>
<h3>Takes Advantage of Illness to Run Away</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, in May of the year before last, Yao unfortunately contracted malaria and resigned from his job to recuperate at home. However, the disease continued to recur for more than a year, eventually becoming tuberculosis and becoming bedridden. Ms. Ye, who was then twenty-seven years old, had been living with Yao for ten years and had no children. Seeing that Yao was on the verge of death, she planned for her future and became familiar with a local man named Lu Longbao. They agreed to take advantage of Yao's serious illness and unawareness to take away silver, jewelry, and clothing worth more than a thousand gold and flee with the child bride Caiyu with Lu.</p>
<h3>Practicing Martial Arts to Cure Illness</h3>
<p>Yao had a close friend named Gao who worked in a charitable hall in this city. Seeing this situation, that Ms. Ye would resort to such means when Yao was critically ill, he shed tears of sympathy for Yao. He volunteered to hire someone to carry the patient to the hall, extend the treatment, and care for him wholeheartedly. After more than a month, the terminal illness improved, and Yao was able to get out of bed and walk gradually. Gao himself was proficient in martial arts and ordered Yao to practice every day. Yao, having been given a new lease on life, obeyed Gao's every command. In a few months, not only was he cured of his illness, but he also learned several sets of martial arts, and his physique became stronger and stronger. He then left the hall to recuperate at home, but he got up every day at dawn to practice martial arts. Now his arms are strong and powerful, and three or five people cannot be his match.</p>
<h3>Six Shots Miss</h3>
<p>Lu and Ms. Ye saw that Yao was still alive and continued to practice martial arts diligently, fearing revenge and assassination. They asked someone to mediate with Yao. Yao put forward two conditions: (1) Return the child bride Caiyu; (2) Compensate for the silver, jewelry, and clothing that was taken away. However, Lu admitted that he had sold Caiyu and could not return her. Regarding the loss, he was willing to pay 200 yuan, which was later increased to 250 yuan. Subsequently, the mediator negotiated back and forth, but to no avail. Therefore, Lu, in order to strike first, led a group of people to Yao's residence to shoot and kill him. Seeing that the situation was bad, Yao resisted with a spear (a red-tasseled spear). Lu and others fired six shots in a row, but none hit, and they fled in different directions.</p>
<h3>Principal Offender at Large</h3>
<p>That night, Yao reported to the Third District Police Station, requesting them to pursue the matter, and stated that Lu and those who came with him included his neighbors Xi Linhua and Xi Ruibao. It was found that the three were also mixed in with the group. Lu fired two shots, Linhua fired two shots, and an unknown person fired two shots. The district immediately dispatched police to arrest the two Xis. According to Linhua's confession, he had mediated beforehand but did not participate in the assault. Ruibao claimed that he had not heard of the matter. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team learned that the principal offender was hiding in a hotel near the Tilanqiao in the Public Concession and immediately sent personnel to arrest him, but he had already escaped upon hearing the news. Chief Zhang sent the two defendants, along with the two bullet casings found at Yao's house, to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>A Confusing and Bizarre</p>
<h3>Suspected Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Based Solely on the Words of a Chauffeur</p>
<p>Police Detectives' Investigation Yields Nothing</p>
<p>Around 7 p.m. last night, a confusing and bizarre kidnapping case occurred in the French Concession. The circumstances were based on the statement of a chauffeur, but police detectives' investigation yielded nothing. After careful verification, the chauffeur's statement had many contradictions. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>A Sudden Youth</h3>
<p>Around 8 p.m. last night, a youth, covered in snow and looking flustered, suddenly came to the Songshan Road Police Station in the French Concession. He claimed to be Shi Wusheng, from Zhenjiang, and currently a chauffeur at the Tefei Motor Company at No. 357 Minguo Road, Anren Street in the Chinese Concession. At 7:25 p.m., just after finishing dinner at the company, a youth of about seventeen or eighteen years old, wearing a black short shirt and pants, speaking with a local accent, and carrying an umbrella, suddenly came to the company to hire a car.</p>
<h3>Hiring a Car and Leaving</h3>
<p>The youth claimed to be a tea servant at the Hongtai Hotel and needed to hire a car to pick up passengers. They agreed on a rental fee of three yuan per hour. The youth paid three silver dollars in advance. The youth then got in with the driver, the author, into Buick Sedan No. 12242 (City No. 654) and headed east, reaching the Bund. Then, it turned into Xinyongan Road, stopping in front of the Jinfaxing store next to the Changfa Hotel.</p>
<h3>Three People Emerging</h3>
<p>After the car stopped, the youth jumped out, pushed the door, and went inside for about ten minutes. The youth came out, got into the car, and sat next to the driver again. Three people then emerged from the door. The two on the left and right were wearing black raincoats, and in the center was a merchant-like person about forty years old, wearing a dark blue long robe, with a pale face, resembling a kidnapped victim. Another person in a blue cotton robe brought up the rear. The four people crowded into the car.</p>
<h3>Pulling Out a Pistol</h3>
<p>One of the four ordered the driver to drive the car to Pubushi Road. The driver started the engine and headed west, through Yongan Road, north through Catholic Church Street, northwest on Avenue Edward VII, past the Eight Immortals Bridge and Avenue Kercado, south to Pubushi Road, and straight west. Along the way, heavy snow fell, and there were very few pedestrians. After a while, they reached a place resembling the front of a church. Suddenly, the driver heard someone whispering behind him, ordering him to drive the car down. At that time, one of the people inside pulled out a pistol and ordered him to stop the car.</p>
<h3>Reporting to the Police and Giving Chase</h3>
<p>Frightened by their power, the driver had to stop the car and was forced out. After the driver got out of the car, one of the people drove the car away. The driver looked around and saw no one, but still desperately chased after them for about dozens of steps. He met a Chinese constable and told him everything. The Chinese constable and the driver continued to chase west, reaching near the Thirteen-Story Building on Avenue Albert, and remotely saw a red light flickering in the snow. But then the light disappeared.</p>
<h3>Police Investigation</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, the police immediately ordered the Chinese and foreign detectives on duty to take the chauffeur to inquire at No. 16 Xinyongan Road, Jinfaxing, whether anyone had been kidnapped recently. They replied that no one had been kidnapped and that they had heard nothing about it. When asked at the Changfa Hotel, there were also no clues. The detectives then took the chauffeur back to the police station and repeatedly questioned him, but the chauffeur still insisted on his original statement. The head of the police, helpless, ordered him to be detained temporarily for investigation and sent telegrams to the public concession police stations and the Chinese Public Security Bureau, asking them to pay attention. But as of press time, the car had not been found.</p>
<p>Pushan Mountain Villa</p>
<h3>Report on the Handling of Jiangzhe Burials Over the Years</h3>
<p>Pushan Mountain Villa, which handles the burials of exposed corpses in Jiangzhe, has had its director, Mr. Wang Junsheng, personally go to the inland areas to inspect and supervise the burial of corpses, regardless of the cold or heat, for many years. A total of 59,060 corpses have been buried. However, due to the January 28 Incident, the work in the spring of last year was interrupted. Only 305 corpses were collected and buried inside and outside the city of Suzhou. In the summer and autumn seasons, 326 dead animals such as cats, dogs, snakes, and rats, and 79 and a half boats of garbage floating in the Suzhou city river were collected and transported to Hengshanbang outside the city for burial. By autumn and winter, officials and employees were ordered to continue working in various places. It has been reported that the number of burials is 4,720 in the tenth district of Wujiang County and 2,621 in Jiaxing County. The actual number of burials in places such as Puwan and Pinghu has not yet been reported. It is expected that the number of corpses collected will also be considerable. Currently, Director Wang has seen that there are many exposed and decayed coffins along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines and plans to send a special burial team to inspect and bury them along the way, making large-scale plans to be careful about hygiene and emphasize humanitarianism. The benevolent ambition of the director of the mountain villa is truly commendable and universal. However, such a large undertaking requires considerable funding. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will cooperate and generously contribute to this benevolent act. Its merit is truly beyond words.</p>

<h3>Small Vendors and the Literary World</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Li Yongming丨</p>
<p>I intend to ask your reporter about a matter that I cannot resolve with my own knowledge: Since losing my job last year, I have been struggling due to the difficulty in finding employment. I feel that if things continue like this, it will be a dead end. Recently, I found a way: to make a living as a small vendor while pursuing my interests and striving for self-improvement in the arts. I have always had a strong interest in literature, so I hope to achieve something in this area. However, I have two questions: ㈠ My education level is only that of a high elementary school graduate. Looking at all the Chinese literary writers today, they are either university students or doctoral graduates from abroad. With my level of education, can I lay a foundation for self-study? ㈡ Are sayings like "Sincerity can move mountains" and "Nothing is difficult in the world if you set your mind to it" just clichés used by the "feudal" and "bourgeois" classes to anesthetize people? From a materialist perspective, these words seem unreliable. I would be grateful if you could analyze these two questions (which I consider to be questions) to avoid misleading me!</p>
<p>Reply: Regarding your two questions, I will answer them separately as follows: Although modern [Chinese literary writers are] either university students or doctoral graduates from abroad, these writers do not hinder you, a writer who is [both making a living as a small vendor and training yourself]. Because most university students or doctoral graduate writers create [their literary works] in bright, clean rooms or conceive their subjects of description on steel-spring beds in down-filled quilts. [Their works, ] even if they are widely sold, are not [things that the general public loves to read or can read]. They have the leisure to talk about love, but they disregard and cannot realistically depict the suffering of the poor. Even if they are willing, they can only express a little "pity" at most, and they can never completely stand on the same front line to be ideological warriors for the poor, wielding their weapons of criticism against their oppressors or exploiters. Therefore, I believe that among genuine literary figures, that is, revolutionary writers, there may also be university students or foreign PhDs, but university students or foreign PhDs who call themselves Chinese writers are not necessarily writers in our eyes. On the contrary, a person like you, if you have the ambition, has a great hope of becoming a revolutionary writer. Because you have tasted the bitterness of economic and social oppression, and you are currently [tasting] it. If you have works, they must be the voices of the people, descriptions that expose the darkness of bad politics and society for the people. I think you are very qualified to strive to become this kind of literary figure. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, many outstanding genius writers have come from apprentices or humble backgrounds, not from university students or PhD graduates, such as the great American scientist, politician, and author Benjamin Franklin, and the great Soviet writer Maxim Gorky. This is one point. The so-called "Sincerity can move mountains" and "Nothing is difficult in the world if you set your mind to it" are originally words of wisdom from the experiences of predecessors, and they are not necessarily [clichés] used by the [feudal] and [bourgeois] classes to anesthetize people.</p>
<p>However, you must know that if someone disregards material conditions and current realities, and only talks to you about cultivating your mind and sincerity, or about having a mind and not having a mind, then it is inevitable that you will be deceived by the [bourgeois class]. For example, now that the Japanese are attacking China, if we do not fight desperately and recover our lost territories, but instead spend all day [chanting Buddhist scriptures], talking about [benevolence, righteousness, and morality], advocating [integrity and honor], and chanting [peaceful struggle], then that is all [nonsense]! Because they abandon current realities and engage in sophistry. Materialists do not oppose people having aspirations; on the contrary, only materialists can truly recognize the laws of nature and the laws of history, and bravely adapt to these laws to transform society, harness nature, and benefit mankind. Materialists do not oppose people establishing [sincerity]. On the contrary, only they can, and only they dare to, stand fearlessly at the forefront of the times, openly criticizing their own mistakes and the mistakes of others. This is [sincerity]. Only they can, and only they dare to, stand fearlessly at the forefront of the times, striving tirelessly to seek happiness for the greatest number of people. This is also [sincerity]. If you aspire to [both be a small vendor and create literature], then work hard without hesitation!</p>

<p>Notice of Funding Allocation to be Issued</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office previously issued notices of funding allocation for September to provincial schools and social education institutions. Although the deadline was set for January 10 to collect the funds, due to insufficient funds in the treasury, in fact, on January 10, each school only received funding for the first half of September. The funding for the second half of the month requires a total of 125,000 yuan. An investigation found that the treasury only had slightly more than 100,000 yuan. It is reported that the Management Office yesterday telegraphed Wujin to immediately transfer 20,000 yuan into the treasury and requested the bank to immediately pay the funding for the second half of September. In this way, it is expected that the funding for September can be settled soon. The funding notices for October were issued three days ago. However, the current treasury is empty, relying entirely on the remittance of funds from various counties. The Management Office yesterday telegraphed various counties, urging them to intensify their efforts in order to solve the problem and raise funds for the October funding for the schools. It is said that the week after the 24th day of the lunar December is the busiest period for collecting funds. The heavy snow and freezing weather the day before yesterday made river ferries inconvenient, causing a slight impact. Section Chief Bei He of the Management Office went to various counties to urge the remittance of funds and handle the division of grain tax surcharges. He sent a quick letter from Wuxi on the 17th, reporting to the Management Office that he was unable to go to Yixing immediately due to the river being frozen. He requested that this should not be a problem in the coming days. As for the funding allocation notices for the first half of November to the counties, they have been sent to the Education Department for signature and can be issued on the 18th, it is said.</p>
<h3>Contents of Elementary School Regulations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that the Elementary and Secondary School Organization Law passed by the Legislative Yuan differs somewhat from the original proposal, making it difficult to implement the original education policy and causing practical difficulties. In addition to Zhu Jiahua proposing four supplementary opinions to the Central Political Council, the Ministry of Education has formulated regulations for elementary and secondary schools to supplement the deficiencies of the Education Organization Law. Among them, the regulations for elementary schools were formally passed by the Ministry Affairs Meeting yesterday and will be formally announced in the coming days after textual revisions. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the elementary school regulations are divided into thirteen chapters. Chapter 1, General Outline, stipulates that compulsory education is four years. Elementary schools are divided into four types: primary and senior elementary schools, simple elementary schools, and short-term elementary schools. Chapter 2, Establishment, stipulates that non-Chinese citizens or organizations cannot establish elementary schools within Chinese territory. Chapter 3, Staffing. Chapter 4, Funding. Chapter 5, Equipment. Chapter 6, Curriculum. Chapter 7, Moral Education. Chapter 8, Examinations and Grades. Chapter 9, School Days and Holidays. Chapter 10, Tuition and Other Fees, stipulates that in compulsory education implementation areas, elementary schools shall not collect tuition fees. Chapter 11, Teachers and Staff. Chapter 12, Research Organization. Chapter 13, Supplementary Provisions. The secondary school regulations are being drafted and will be announced in the shortest possible time, it is said.</p>

<p>High school and junior high school every week</p>
<h3>Teaching and Self-Study Hours for Each Subject</h3>
<p>Transmitted by Order of the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in accordance with an order from the Ministry [of Education], forwarded a table of weekly teaching and self-study hours for each subject in senior and junior high school for each semester, instructing all schools as follows: "Regarding Instruction No. 862 from the Ministry of Education, it states that the table of subjects and credits for general science in junior and senior high schools has already been publicly announced and implemented by the Ministry in August and October of the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929] along with the provisional curriculum standards. This August, the Ministry held a revision meeting for the curriculum standards for senior and junior high schools, and established a table of weekly teaching and self-study hours for each subject in senior and junior high school for each semester, which was approved by the meeting. This table of hours differs greatly from the previously issued provisional standards in terms of subjects and credits in the following aspects: 1) Because middle school education is still based on the academic year system and teaching is still calculated by time, the credit system has been abolished to avoid discrepancies in the calculation of credits and teaching time; 2) Junior high school serves as a continuation of basic elementary school training, while senior high school serves as a solid foundation for entering university. All subjects and time have been carefully allocated, eliminating the need for students to make further choices, so elective subjects have been uniformly abolished in both senior and junior high school; 3) In accordance with the central government's decision, Party ideology materials should be incorporated into subjects such as civics, history, and geography, and a separate subject of Party ideology will no longer be established; 4) The prescribed self-study hours ensure that the total learning time for students each day is appropriately distributed, in order to achieve a balance between work and rest and not hinder physical and mental development. In addition, a second table of weekly teaching and self-study hours for each subject in senior and junior high school for each semester has been established, adding Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and second foreign languages to meet the special needs of various regions. Both of the above tables have been given final revisions by the Ministry. In addition to being announced by order of the Ministry, the tables are now being forwarded to you, and you are instructed to immediately order all middle schools under your jurisdiction to comply with them from the next semester." In accordance with this, we are urgently copying and issuing one copy each of the table of weekly teaching and self-study hours for each subject in senior and junior high school for each semester, and the second table, for your compliance.</p>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools</p>

<h3>Military Academy Basketball Team</h3>
<p>Arrives in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Practices at Xiqing Tonight</p>
<p>Plays against MacLaines Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>The Central Military Academy basketball team, which shook the capital and defeated MacLaines twice, will come to Shanghai today by appointment to exchange skills with the strong teams in Shanghai and see who is better.</p>
<h3>Practice Tonight</h3>
<p>After the team arrives in Shanghai, it will practice in the Xiqing basketball room tonight to observe the terrain. The Xiqing basketball room is smaller than the military academy's court in Beijing. Without prior practice, the team will be unfamiliar with the court in terms of offense and defense, and will inevitably suffer a lot.</p>
<h3>Formidable Strength</h3>
<p>According to those in the capital who have personally witnessed the team's battles, the military academy basketball team is indeed highly skilled and powerful. Its most notable characteristic is its superior physical strength and stamina. It can fight consistently from beginning to end, without any slack, and become more and more courageous as it fights. It is no coincidence that it won twice against MacLaines. Its lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Right Forward Liu Juanchang Right Guard Gao Lingzhao</p>
<p>Center Huang Jianding</p>
<p>Left Forward Zuo Gongyu Left Guard Wang Shixuan</p>
<h3>Debuts Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>Four games have been set in Shanghai, all of which are very important and are against the strongest teams in Shanghai. The first game tomorrow night is against MacLaines, who was defeated twice in Beijing. This time, the team is determined to seek revenge. The game against Fanwangdu is on Saturday night. The Military Academy is confident in these two games. Next Monday, they will face the Hai Zei team, which roams the sea. This game is worth watching. The last game is against Hujiang on Wednesday. In recent times, there has been little vitality in the East China basketball scene. It is hoped that the Military Academy can come and inject a shot of morphine. All games are at Xiqing, starting at 8:00 pm every night. The order is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Friday (20th) vs. MacLaines</p>
<p>Saturday (21st) vs. John</p>
<p>Monday (23rd) vs. Hai Zei</p>
<p>Wednesday (25th) vs. Hujiang</p>

<h3>Correction of the Chinese Football Schedule</h3>
<p>Gaoqiao vs. Puyi on Sunday</p>
<p>This week's Chinese Football Association schedule wants to forget you. Gaoqiao vs. Puyi will compete at the Athletics Field at 1:00 PM on Sunday, not Gaoqiao vs. Public Security. This is a correction.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Sports Field Launches</p>
<h3>Basketball Sports Cup Championship</h3>
<p>For the purpose of promoting sports and enhancing interest in ball games, the Zhejiang Provincial Sports Field has specially prepared a large silver cup by the field director Chen Baiqing, named the Sports Cup, as the championship trophy for the Hangzhou City Basketball Competition. All basketball teams organized by schools and organizations in the city can join the competition and win the championship. The method is in accordance with the Shanghai Rotary Cup method, held three times in three years, that is, the team that wins the championship in the first year will have the team name engraved on the cup, and the winning team will take it back for display. In the second year, the basketball team that wins the second championship will also have the team name engraved on the cup. In the third year, the one that wins the championship three times in a row or has the most wins will own it, as the final decision of the cup. Registration is now being prepared, and the competition will be held at the beginning of the next semester.</p>
<p>After the Jinan Winter Ball Games Concluded</p>
<h3>Director He of the Education Department Issued Awards and Gave Instructions</h3>
<p>| Sports Field Expansion | Football Field |</p>
<p>Cross-Country Race Rescheduled to February</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The Provincial People's Sports Field, in order to prepare for participation in the North China Ball Games, launched the Winter Ball Games before the New Year. There were five groups in total: Men's Senior Football and Basketball, Junior Football and Basketball, and Women's Basketball. Dozens of teams participated, which was a grand occasion for a time. After six weeks of competition, there were quite a few wonderful performances in the ice and snow. After the New Year, it has completely ended. The sons-in-law's senior football and basketball championships were all won by armed comrades. The Education Department specially prepared five banners to reward the five champion teams. The award ceremony was held at the Sports Field on the 15th. Director He Siyuan of the Education Department personally came to award the prizes and gave instructions. At 10:30 in the morning, the champion teams gathered in the gymnasium of the Sports Field. In a group of strong and tall athletes, there was also a team of sturdy and graceful women soldiers, which was even more outstanding. There were inscriptions on each banner, namely: Men's Senior Football [Courage and Wisdom], Men's Senior Basketball [I Promote Martial Virtues], Men's Junior Basketball [Self-Improvement Day by Day], Men's Junior Football [National Spirit], Women's Basketball [Promote National Glory]. The athletes of each team were delighted and happy under observation. After a short time, Director He Siyuan of the Education Department and Director Shang Shumei of the Sports Field arrived. Shang first reported that the winter ball spring competition lasted six weeks. The result was very good, and it was able to show everyone's spirit. Today, I am here to award the prizes. Although there are very few prizes, it is only a memorial for each champion, but the honor is very great and cannot be bought with money, and so on. Then the names were called, and He Siyuan personally awarded the prizes: 1. The Men's Senior Football Champion, Jing Xian, 2. The Men's Junior Football Champion, Donglu, 3. The Men's Senior Basketball Champion, Boai, 4. The Senior Junior Basketball Champion, Zhengyi, 5. The Women's Basketball Champion, Nvshi. After the awards were presented, He also gave instructions, saying that the national spirit lies in the physique and depends on the athletes to promote it. In particular, the ball can show the spirit of the team. The government is now actively promoting and vigorously expanding sports fields. The country is in such a precarious state that a group of citizens must make every effort to strengthen their physique. The Sports Field is now purchasing land and plans to add a baseball field to promote baseball, and so on. After the speech, a photo was taken together and dispersed.</p>
<p>In addition, the sports field of this province was built during the 14th North China Games, and it has a rough scale, but the football field is still lacking. It is temporarily held at the athletics field. There are too few tennis, volleyball, and basketball courts. Now the sports field has been approved by the Education Department to add tennis and volleyball courts to the field, and construction is underway. Provincial Chairman Han Fu and his son visited Qianfo Mountain in the cold this morning, and also went to the sports field. His wife also played tennis at the sports field, and her skills were also very exquisite. In addition, the People's Sports Field previously launched a cross-country race, a 5,000-meter race for men and a 3,000-meter race for women (starting from the sports field to the foot of Qianfo Mountain and back). It was originally scheduled to be held on the 8th of this month, but due to repeated snowfall, the snow melted and re-froze, and the road was slippery and difficult to travel. It was inevitable that it was temporarily postponed. As of now, there are more than 50 men and more than 20 women who have registered. It is expected that the snow will melt and the weather will warm up in February, and the date will be set again.</p>

<h3>A Small Contribution to the Domestic Product Industry</h3>
<p>— Bai Hong</p>
<p>Recently, there are so many new domestic products with altered appearances on the market. In particular, the new brands of cotton yarn, knitted goods, etc., are innumerable. This clever trick of mixing fish eyes with pearls is truly admirable for the intelligence and talent of those people.</p>
<p>However, this kind of mask is not difficult to see through. You only need to ask him where the manufacturing is located. For genuine domestic products, the clerks will naturally be able to answer immediately, or at least be able to inquire. For fakes, they will be dumbfounded and unable to answer.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that all domestic product manufacturers must clearly state the address of the manufacturing plant and distributor on the product or packaging in the future. This will make it possible to immediately distinguish between genuine and fake products, and on the one hand, it will enable buyers to investigate at any time, and on the other hand, it will increase their own credibility.</p>
<p>How Should Domestic Products Find a Way Out Under Heavy Pressure</p>
<h3>How Should Domestic Products Find a Way Out (III)</h3>
<p>— Du Chongda</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it naturally becomes the target of competition among various forces. For a hundred years, our country has been able to enter and exit without any obstacles. The tariffs on which the country relies for its lifeline are still shackled under treaties and held by others! As the capitalist countries are struggling with production and have nowhere to go, feeling that there is no way to heaven and no way to earth, they naturally regard our country as the only place to compete for. They have adopted a "casting" policy, making China their biggest customer. For example, since Japan implemented military aggression against China, their trade with China has occupied the most dominant position. Because the whole of China unanimously abandoned Japanese goods, it has suffered a great blow. It has also been greatly affected by the deteriorating global environment, and the economic panic has reached its peak. Therefore, it has intensified its use of dumping methods against me, especially reducing the price of goods, stimulating the purchasing power of the Chinese people, and trying to suck the last bit of fat and blood from the Chinese people. Under such circumstances, even with Sun Yat-sen's great nation-building legacy, there is no way to start! Our country's industry is shackled under the political and economic oppression of the imperialists, and has long been wandering in the declining twilight, unable to enter a new stage. It has now stepped onto the juncture of life and death. At present, there are quite a few intellectuals in the country who are overcoming all difficulties and running various industries themselves, which seems to emit a ray of dawn in domestic products; however, based on the various situations mentioned above, if we want to find a way out for our country's domestic products, we must have several prerequisites.</p>
<h3>Factory Worker Training for Kang Yuan Factory of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang, the owner of Kang Yuan Factory, said: Although the factory's worker training has already achieved considerable results, I still believe it is insufficient, hence the plan for factory worker training of tomorrow. Factory worker training is closely related to the environment. A good environment makes it easier to exert effort, while a bad environment makes it difficult to achieve results. The surrounding area of our factory is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the temptations for our factory workers are also increasing daily. Since we cannot isolate factory workers from society, nor can we make them as unfeeling as meditating monks, the only effective solution is to emulate Mencius's mother and move three times, choosing a virtuous neighborhood to reside in. Because even fragrant plants will smell bad if kept in the same container as stinky herbs for ten years. The effect of dyeing silk is not unique to Mozi. Our factory will, after several years, select a suitable location and relocate. The area must be 500 mu (a Chinese unit of area), to build a city, dig ponds, plant fruit trees, establish a stadium, open schools, build hospitals, create commercial shops, set up amusement parks, and even prepare a public cemetery, so that our factory becomes a new world. All factory workers will be clothed, fed, educated, entertained, and will live out their lives within the factory. The factory will be a big family for the workers, a "Peach Blossom Spring". By then, I will no longer know whether Kang Yuan is a factory, a school, a society, or a country. These ideal worlds have lingered in my mind for years, and their realization still awaits the future. I have no name for it, so I will tentatively call it "Factory Worker Training of Tomorrow."</p>
<h3>Contributing to the National Goods Promotion Center</h3>
<p>— Pan Yangqiu</p>
<p>In recent times, patriotic individuals in various places have devoted themselves to the work of the National Goods Promotion Center during this national goods movement. Their service to society is truly admirable, and their dedication to effective, fundamental work, despite hardship, is worthy of praise. In recent months, representatives from Chongqing, Qingdao, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangxi, Guangzhou, and other places have come to Shanghai to discuss matters. Some have even humbly sought advice. In addition to providing timely contributions on specific issues, I also have some small contributions to offer, hoping that my comrades will discuss them together and strive for their realization.</p>
<p>The purpose of the National Goods Promotion Center is not only to display national goods but, more importantly, to promote them. Therefore, investigation and research are the fundamental work of the National Goods Promotion Center. We must understand the latest market conditions and the status of national goods. The National Goods Promotion Center should also help the production sector by informing them of local and nearby customs and which goods are more suitable for promotion. In the national goods movement, the promotion center is like a matchmaker in a marriage. The connection between the production sector and consumers relies heavily on the promotion center as a mediator.</p>
<p>In this national goods movement with an element of resistance against the enemy, introducing national goods as substitutes for foreign goods, especially those deeply penetrating the interior, is a good fundamental solution. The National Goods Promotion Center naturally has an inescapable responsibility for this important task. Fortunately, this is not a localized problem. If national goods communities in various places can cooperate and work together to collect information and share references, it can be accomplished without much trouble. After the September 18th Incident, the China National Goods Promotion Center (80 Hualong Road) compiled a catalog of national goods and collected materials on national goods that can substitute for Japanese goods, which can be used as a reference for national goods promotion centers in various places.</p>
<p>The issue of raw materials for national goods affects not only the pricing of national goods but also has a close relationship with the socio-economic conditions of the place of origin. If National Goods Promotion Centers in various places can promote the raw materials of their localities and nearby areas to the outside world, the production sector will certainly gain significant benefits. Furthermore, promoting and improving raw materials can help the local economic organizations on the verge of collapse. I hope comrades in charge in various places will consider the overall national economy and unhesitatingly take on this difficult mission!</p>
<p>In short, dedicating oneself to the cause of national goods promotion is entirely for the sake of serving society, helping others succeed without seeking personal gain. The spirit and determination of comrades in charge of and engaged in national goods promotion centers in various places are worthy of our respect. However, we still hope that comrades in various places will further break down the distinction between "us" and "them," recognize this cause as their own, and strive forward. Then, when the National Goods Promotion Center succeeds in the future, who can say it is not our success!</p>
<h3>The Future Path of Our Country's Textile Industry (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xianfang</p>
<p>(A) Rationalize operations; avoid speculation; simplify products; demand consistent standards for raw cotton. (B) Rationalize labor; reduce expenses. (C) Government actively implements protective policies. (D) Financial sector expands textile investment for powerful cooperation. (E) Chinese people purchase and use domestically produced textiles.</p>
<p>C. Government Actively Implements Protective Policies</p>
<p>Agriculture and industry are the only productive elements of a nation, and the government should provide them with vigorous encouragement and protection. The way to protect industry is to ensure that national production and consumption are appropriate in quantity, preventing foreign goods from disrupting our markets and causing damage to Chinese merchants and factories. Therefore, raising tariff barriers to block the import of foreign goods is the way to safeguard domestic industry. However, if tariffs are raised, foreign merchants will change their strategies, using unequal treaties as protection, bringing their sophisticated machinery and superior technology to set up factories in our treaty ports, and stably setting the principle of equality as not allowing the slightest error, then the way to encourage them will stop. Taking the textile industry as an example, the quantity of domestic raw cotton is insufficient, and the fiber is too coarse and short to be used for spinning fine yarn. Therefore, a portion still depends on the import of foreign cotton, so lower the tax rate to prevent the cost from increasing due to heavy taxes. Cotton cloth is something we can make, but there is concern that foreign goods will be dumped at prices below cost, resulting in losses, so raise the tax rate to prevent dumping. For domestic textile factories, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign-owned, raise the unified tax uniformly. For Chinese factories, transfer the increased amount to a subsidy fund. In this way, Chinese factories can be effectively protected, not subject to competition, and gradually advance on the path to prosperity. It is good that Mr. Wu Tiecheng of the Central Committee has a proposal to protect the textile industry at the Third Plenary Session, which is good news for our textile industry. I secretly hope that the government will be able to implement it when the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement expires in May of this year.</p>
<p>D. Financial Sector Expands Textile Investment for Powerful Cooperation</p>
<p>Banks and money houses are the means of regulating the financial surpluses and deficits of industry and commerce. Whether industry and commerce can develop depends on the prosperity or decline of the financial industry. Industry and commerce must rely on financial regulation to have the possibility of development, and the financial industry must also be able to advance its business because of industrial development. Therefore, the financial industry and industry share the same prosperity and decline, and are inextricably linked. The [Suggestions for Promoting the Textile Industry during the National Crisis New Year] in the 21st year have already made this clear. According to the 20th Annual Business Report of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, the total investment in industry was more than 23 million yuan, accounting for 34.30% of the total loans. Investment in the textile industry accounted for 42.78% of the total industrial investment. In the 21st year, the total investment in textiles further increased to more than 14 million taels, an increase of about 42% compared with the 20th year. The Bank of China claims this. These two banks are maintaining industry, and especially emphasize the textile industry, because cotton textiles are the minimum necessity of people's livelihood, and the total output of national textiles is far from being self-sufficient, so there is great potential for development. The two banks can understand the inside story in detail and help the textile industry to develop, which is enough to admire their great vision. I firmly hope to continue what has been done and expand it, and especially hope that the entire financial community can emulate the actions of the two banks, and cooperate powerfully with the cotton industry, after foreign goods dump cotton industry business, in addition to decline. Textile companies are indeed experiencing slightly more inventory and less flexible turnover, so they should be given regulation, and should not be forced to do nothing. Factories with inflexible turnover may tell each other about the actual situation of their business, and ask for strong protection. Sincere unity, mutual understanding, and mutual maintenance, so that dumping violence has no way to succeed, and our textile industry can move from maintaining the status quo to development, seeing that the final victory does not belong to us.</p>
<p>E. Chinese People Purchase and Use Domestically Produced Textiles</p>
<p>Domestic textiles are products made in the country. Chinese people exchange money for cloth, and textile factories then use the money to purchase domestic raw cotton and make it into textiles. In this way, money circulates between agriculture, industry, and commerce, and there is no risk of it overflowing abroad. After the September 18th Incident, Chinese people rose up to resist foreign goods, so imports decreased sharply, and domestic factories flourished for a time. This was enough to give them a great blow, and it was an important plan for cultivating our national strength. They knew very well that the Chinese people were greedy for cheap goods, so they implemented a dumping policy, importing in large quantities, especially cotton goods. If the Chinese people still adhere to their long-held wish to resist foreign goods, treating them like dirt, even if the goods are given away for free, they will refuse to accept them. Textile factories will again be affected, and will not be able to take measures to cope with them. However, the national strength is exhausted, and foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent. Unless we replenish our strength, we will not be able to resist foreign troubles and secure our borders. Unless we purchase domestic goods and refuse to buy foreign goods, we will not be able to stop the outflow of profits and support ourselves. I secretly hope that the Chinese people will strengthen their belief in resisting humiliation, purchase domestic goods, and keep national money circulating among our agriculture, industry, and commerce forever. Then, even if dumping violence is increased, whether to purchase or not is our absolute freedom, and it will surely have no way to exert its ability.</p>
<p>I am worried about the dumping of foreign cotton goods, which will hit our textile industry, and that our textile industry's beliefs are not firm and it will voluntarily succumb, so I have made a design for the future path, as a humble contribution, which is also what the textile industry is happy to hear, and what the government and social figures are willing to do?</p>
<h3>Sales Problems Under Scientific Management Methods</h3>
<p>Mr. Cheng Shouchong has studied sales problems abroad for a long time. After returning to China, he served as a professor at the Business School of Fudan University. Regarding the issue of domestic national goods sales, he continues to explore and spare no effort. The Industrial and Commercial Management Association recently invited Mr. Cheng to speak on sales issues. This is a record of his speech. (Recorded by Zhiya)</p>
<p>Sales arise because of production. Where there is production, there must be sales. There is a close relationship in economics. However, our Chinese manufacturers do not consider sales to be important. When I met several factory friends, they all said that they did not need sales. Although it cannot be said that most manufacturers have this mentality, many national goods manufacturers are indeed too busy because business is too good and no longer pay attention to sales issues. However, according to my personal observations, the reason why the national goods production sector is so developed at present is because we advocate national goods. In marketing terms, the motive for purchase is entirely based on emotion; it is an emotional motive. Customers still have rational motives and patronage motives when buying. Foreigners use large advertising expenses and sales efforts to compete with us. Whether our national goods manufacturers can resist is a serious question. Therefore, our Chinese manufacturers should immediately pay attention to sales issues. This is my first point.</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese industry and commerce sold national goods based on experience and speculation, without scientific numerical calculations, which often led to less than satisfactory results. This is very important, so I hope to solve it with scientific methods:</p>
<p>(I) Market research, to understand market conditions;</p>
<p>(II) Analyze the results of market research and design accordingly;</p>
<p>(III) Train salespersons, because salespersons in many stores in Shanghai give customers a bad impression, which greatly affects sales issues. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>From the Queen's Birth to the Thought of Excessive Women</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago, poets who valued men over women would sing [Give him a scepter to play with, swaddle him in white blankets] when a boy was born; and [Give her a tile to play with, swaddle her on the ground] when a girl was born. The class of men and women, so obviously different! Reading these lines, everyone would scold the old-fashioned and backward-thinking ancient poets! But unexpectedly, even in the European civilized world of equal rights for men and women, they would use cannons to express their valuing of men over women, just like our ancient poets. This is something to wonder and marvel at! As reported in this newspaper, on the 13th in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, the people of Bulgaria were disappointed to hear the news of the queen giving birth to a daughter. The night before, they heard that the queen was in labor and gathered outside the palace, hoping to hear the good news of the birth of an heir. The cannons roared, reporting the news of the birth of a son or a daughter. A hundred and one cannon shots were fired for the birth of a son, but only twenty-one for the birth of a daughter. The people listening to the cannons were all excited, but after the twenty-first shot, it fell silent, and countless happy faces turned into disappointment!</p>
<p>There was an eighty-shot difference in the cannon fire for the birth of a son and a daughter. Ha! Where is the equality of men and women? Originally, things are valued for their scarcity. Since the war, European countries have often suffered from an excess of women. In Finland, on average, there are three women for every man, so two-thirds of the women are surplus. The number of employees in the country's stores, post offices, and factories is twice as high for women as for men. Countless elderly women never find a husband. In other countries, Spain is also suffering from an excess of women. The national average shows that there are three women for every man. Since the expulsion of King Alfonso, the number of female members of Congress in the republican government has immediately increased sharply. If it were among the Chinese population, one would say [Yin is flourishing and Yang is declining].</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaded, the long-term sacrifice of soldiers on both sides has also been an engine for creating an excess of women. Moreover, once the war expands, there is a possibility of a second world war breaking out, then the problem of excess women will become a world problem! Alas!</p>
<h3>Two Inverse Proportions</h3>
<p>— Pang Zisu</p>
<p>I happened to remember two things in China, and compared them with the United States, they became exactly the inverse proportion in mathematics.</p>
<p>First, the first inverse proportion</p>
<p>In 1773, the British people in the British colonies in America rose up to resist because the British government implemented taxes, expressing their unwillingness to submit, and even beating officials from time to time. On one occasion, a British tea ship arrived in Boston Harbor. Unexpectedly, fifty so-called Boston Tea Party members rushed onto the ship and threw all 340 boxes of tea into the sea. As a result, war broke out, and the British people in the British colonies in America finally became independent and formed the United States.</p>
<p>In 1840, because the Chinese people burned the opium of British merchants, the Opium War broke out. As a result, China not only paid reparations but also opened five ports for trade.</p>
<p>Logically, opium is an illegal thing, which not only loses money but also damages the body, so there is a need to prohibit it. Taking the independence of the United States as an example, we Chinese should have won a greater victory than the United States, but the result was an inverse proportion to the United States.</p>
<p>This inverse proportion is the beginning of the decline of the Chinese nation into a [semi-colony].</p>
<p>Second, the second inverse proportion;</p>
<p>In recent years, we Chinese have been rapidly assimilating with the United States; especially in the universities, which are the factories of the intellectual class, it is undeniable.</p>
<p>Even the candy eaten in the mouth is not taken unless it is the various candies and Beauty Brand raisins from Beiquina. May I ask, which one is not shipped from the United States?</p>
<p>Originally, there is no harm in enjoying this kind of product of highly developed capitalism; but we need to understand that China's production is the production of the 18th century!</p>
<p>[Production in the 18th century, consumption in the 20th century,] is this not an inverse proportion in mathematics? Therefore, China has been reduced to a semi-colony, 丨 the cesspool of surplus production in capitalism.</p>
<p>Winter Sketches</p>
<h3>丨Street Vendor's Song丨</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>In the past, in Suzhou, it was very quiet in the early morning, and winter added a touch of quiet solitude. I always loved to lean on the pillow, close my eyes, and greedily listen to the street vendor's song coming from the distant alley. As long as you listen carefully, it will give you a sense of musical beauty, not like birdsong, not like the pipa; it will also give you poetic inspiration, able to be intoxicated in the realm of soft and sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>As for me, my heart would beat at the thought of flowers, and these flowers came from the lips of a beautiful young girl, singing slowly in a lingering, drawn-out, and rounded Suzhou accent; my heart would tremble. Every morning, when I heard the street vendor's song, I would worry that her fragile and delicate vocal cords would break, and I often prayed for her to stop singing for a while.</p>
<p>If the street vendor's song suddenly turned into another winding alley, gradually fading away in the wind, and the sound waves gradually disappeared from high to low, at this time, I would feel sad as if I had lost a treasure. Experiencing the beautiful sound waves that remain in my memory.</p>
<p>This impression is not easy to forget until now. In Shanghai, I once heard Miss Tang Shuming, the flower girl in the [Suzhou Night Talk] performed by the Southern Country Drama Society, sing the street vendor's song. She raised her flower-like delicate voice and sang the song [Faint Yangtze River, long and leisurely traveler's feelings!] I was therefore even more passionately moved. Now Miss Tang is wandering in the southern country of pearls and lychees. I wonder what her life is like?</p>
<p>A poet once wrote a couplet that said [The tavern opens, the wind is also drunk,] [The flower seller passes by, the road is still fragrant.] Describing the flower seller as so charming.</p>
<p>Now it is again the end of the year, and near the City God Temple, it is full of celestial bamboo and wintersweet, sold to the young ladies and wives of the city to decorate the New Year's parlor. Although the fragrance is also wafting in the wind and snow, compared to [the flower seller's song in Suzhou,] it feels too crude and unbearable.</p>
<h3>Plum Blossoms and Snow Competing in Fragrance Talk About Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Famous actor Mei Wanhua, at the request of the Suzhou public welfare organization, came to Suzhou to perform a charity performance for three days. Those who came with Mei included famous actors Jin Shaoshan, Ma Lianliang, famous amateurs Qian Zhixiang, Sun Lanting, etc.; and Shanghai celebrity Huang Jinrong also accompanied them to Suzhou. Although it snowed heavily for three days, the attendance was unprecedented in Suzhou theaters. Therefore, the highlights are collected and submitted to Spring and Autumn. Readers should not criticize it as yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Mei came to Suzhou this time to do charity for the public welfare of Suzhou, so the local officials and gentry prepared a plaque [Welcome Dr. Mei Lanfang] at the station to reward Mei's kindness; and prepared ten flower horse-drawn carriages for each famous actor to ride into the city. However, this aroused the sourness of the Suzhou rickshaw trade association, which actually published a notice protesting the entry of horse-drawn carriages into the city in the newspaper, which was a big fuss about nothing.</p>
<p>Mei's performance is to do charity for public welfare; therefore, those who serve in the theater are all local officials and gentry in Suzhou. County Magistrate Zou supervised the ticket sales, the chief of the Public Security Bureau supervised the backstage, and Suzhou celebrity Liu Zhengkang sat in a four-wheeled car at the main road, directing everything in the yard, and Mr. Zhang Zhongren also took on the responsibility of guarding the gate of the courtyard, and he is worthy of admiration for his enthusiasm for public welfare.</p>
<p>During the three days, in addition to local people, foreigners traveling to Suzhou also made reservations to appreciate Mei Lang's art, numbering no less than fifty or sixty people. Mei's magic power is really great!</p>
<p>The tickets sold for the performance were divided into six types; the lowest price also required two yuan, so the general poor people who loved Mei crowded outside the theater gate, looking up, waiting for Mei Wang to arrive. So that they could catch a glimpse of his face in the carriage. This can truly be called [quenching thirst with plums].</p>
<h3>Hu Boxiang's Random Notes on Traveling in Yi (One) [Boating in the Water Cave]</h3>
<p>Boating in the Water Cave of Shanshan</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Guilty Heart</h3>
<p>— Liao Hongshoujuan</p>
<p>He still remembered that he had traveled alone many times. Because this kind of poetic scenery was too much to his liking for him who had the eyes of a poet, and everything in sight was enough to make him infatuated. So every time he came, he would linger痴痴ly for a long time, until the悠悠钟声, with the微微的晚风, sounded from the hidden corner of the red wall. He then silently followed the crows帰鴉under the thin 薄薄 evening glow of the sky and slowly帰去.</p>
<p>He was more infatuated with every grass, tree, flower, and stone on this road than a child was infatuated with candy. Every time he came back, he would still happily赞叹 and say; [This is truly heaven on earth; the paradise of the soul. After a day of wandering, the dreams on the pillow also feel pure and pleasant.]</p>
<p>However, before the curtain of the future was unveiled, he never dreamed in his dreams that in this enchanting fairyland, an evil that even God could do nothing about would be staged.</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>Ouyang Sheng was no longer willing to think about it, because thinking about it would only make him ashamed. But the tide of thoughts did not obey the强制 of autonomy, and still映着 the past. The幕 of the night had long笼罩 the earth, and he in the darkness was still leaning on the willow tree,昏惘ly drunk, unable to think of歸去.</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>He had been陶醉 in the盛情 of the care of the Dongfang Sheng couple for more than four months. Since he was欣羡ing Dongfang Sheng's home, he would恨 himself for not being able to get a伴侣 as naive and lively as Madam Dongfang. Indeed, his life had been支配 by the authority of his stepmother. His father was a醉汉, living his daily life in wine, and he could not顾得到 his marriage problems. Moreover, he could not融洽 his relationship with his stepmother. Every time he saw Xiaoman and her husband栽花种竹,学习书写, that不得不使 him to感触. Although Xiaoman always avoided嫌疑 like his own sister, he痴想着; [Xiaoman is after all another's夫人!]</p>
<p>One of the places Dongfang Sheng liked to留连 the most was the激一片小池塘 next to Ouyang Sheng. In this这里, he could釣鱼;吟啸, and even游乐 everything. It was only里许 away from Dongfang's别墅, and there was a狭小 path to pass through. Besides the two rows of trees on both sides, wild花盛开, and there were also 30 to 40竿细竹. He once高兴着 said to Ouyang Sheng; he wished to离开人世 here in the future, and be buried in the乡 of山明水秀,方向 无憾, because this这里 was after all only a distance of twenty里路 from the city, and perhaps it would繁盛起来 soon and would not be able to be the坟墓 of his永久归宿. He could only交还 his life to上帝 and留 a纪念 at this here. (Ten)</p>
<p>What is 至</p>
<h3>宜南探勝記朱壽仁</h3>
<p>丨善卷洞之遊丨</p>
<p>Yixing is rich in beautiful mountains and rivers, with the two caves of Shanjuan and Gengsang being particularly outstanding. In the past, Su Dongpo considered buying fields in Yangxian a refined pursuit, and its beauty can be imagined. Yangxian is the present-day Yixing.</p>
<p>Ao Qing-jun of the Shanghai Yousheng Travel Group, being on friendly terms with Mao Mu-jun, the Director of the Yixing Public Security Bureau, made an appointment to visit Yixing. Thanks to the latter's arrangements, their wish to ascend and view the scenery was fulfilled. The group consisted of more than forty people.</p>
<p>At noon on the 24th of last month, they took a train to Wuxi, disembarked and boarded a boat, traveling along the inland river. The boat was a large electric-lit vessel, towed by a motorboat. Heavy rain and fog made navigation difficult, and they arrived at dawn at 4 o'clock. They stayed at the Sanxin Hotel.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, they boarded the boat and set off, with Director Mao personally leading the way. They passed through Xijiu, a vast lake with sails dotting the surface like floating seagulls.</p>
<p>At noon, the boat docked, after traveling about sixty li. They disembarked and walked for half an hour to the beautiful Luoyan. The Yixing gentleman Chu Weng Nanqiang, along with his nephew Chu Shengfu, Anping, daughter-in-law Ms. Yu Manhua, daughter Nengzi, and others, greeted them at the Luoyan Cottage. After a brief rest, they visited the Shanjuan Cave. Shanjuan was a person of the Yu Dynasty, a follower of Xu You and Wu Guang. He avoided Emperor Yao's offer of the throne and lived in seclusion here, hence the cave was named after him; later, to avoid the taboo of Emperor Dong Hun of Qi, the character "Juan" was changed to "Quan."</p>
<p>The cave is divided into upper, middle, lower, and rear sections, shaped like a building, and is known as the "building cave." They first visited the middle cave (also known as the Buddha Cave), descending the stone steps. The steps are carved with Ganoderma lucidum patterns, hand-painted by Ms. Manhua. At the end of the steps is the entrance to the cave, inside which a solitary peak stands tall, over two zhang high and dozens of embraces in circumference. An Amitabha Buddha statue is enshrined on top, and the four characters "Xiao Xumi Shan" (Little Mount Sumeru) are engraved below. Strange rocks hang down from the cave ceiling, swaying as if about to fall. Going around the peak, the entire view is revealed. The cave is four or five zhang in height and width, and twenty zhang deep. Beside the cave, huge rocks take the shape of beasts, a king elephant on the right and a green lion on the left, several zhang high, formed by stalactites. The stone color is clear and moist, with mountain air dripping, stalactites hanging upside down, stacked like layers, carved like cuts, like dragons hanging down, like tigers crouching, exquisite and strange, seemingly about to fly through the air. Buddha statues are sculpted, with the color of the stalactites being emerald green, hanging down like banners, the dignified appearance solemn and lifelike, the Ling Mountain Assembly seemingly before one's eyes.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold Price Decline of Four Taels and One Mace</h3>
<h3>Return of 800 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign cables reported that the London big bar fell by 0.0625, the US dollar fell by 0.125, and both the British and American exchange rates saw a decline. However, the forward silver market trended upward, and American cotton also saw a rebound. Bank private cables also increased by 0.0625, unexpectedly. As a result, the gold market opened lower at 799 taels. Furthermore, due to foreign cable reports that the United States planned to issue 25 million subsidiary coins, it fell further to 795 taels and 8 mace. People's exchange rates at HSBC remained unchanged, and then slightly stabilized. The Central Bank still came to the market to show cash, repeatedly returning to the 98 or 99 taels range, still in a state of hovering. The market situation was mediocre, and major players remained unexcited. Finally, it closed at 798 taels and 8 mace. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Regained Stability After the Decline</h3>
<p>In the morning, the mood became tired due to the silver market trending upward. Banks opened with the near-term British exchange rate at 1 shilling and 8 pence, and the American exchange rate at 28 yuan, seeing a strengthening trend. Therefore, it opened lower at 799 taels, a decline of 3 taels and 9 mace compared to the previous close. Dadecheng made the first sale, but the amount was not large, gradually decreasing to 98 taels. Shunli also purchased a small amount at this time, and Yifeng also came to purchase bars, rising to outside 99 taels, and soon reached 99 taels and 4 mace. Banks had already done April US dollars at 25, a slight increase of 0.0625 compared to the initial opening. Hongli then offered at 8 taels and 2 mace, Huabi sold at 0.0625. The January US dollars of Hengyu were sold, breaking through 8 taels. Zhifeng, Yongda, and Dadecheng only came to fiercely sell, at 7 taels. May US dollars at 375 were not easy to sell. The mood was chaotic. Zhifeng and Yong's selling wind remained strong. Wanxing and Ruima also came to sell. The market situation deteriorated greatly, retreating to 95 taels and 8 mace. Items were entered, hovering outside 8 taels, gradually reaching 97 taels. Wanxing suddenly took in, rising to around 7 taels and a half. Before long, it fell again to within 7 taels. Zhaofengchang came to purchase bars, rising by half a tael. However, retail investors dumped their holdings, and the price could not stand high. HSBC's shilling and US dollar rates remained unchanged. The tired situation was able to recover. Zhaofengchang came again, increasing from 7 taels and a half to 8 taels. Huabi took in April US dollars at 25, also turning peaceful. Hengxing entered bars, breaking out of 8 taels to around 8 taels and a half. Although there was hovering afterward, it reached 99 taels. Fushun sold, showing a slight downstream, but was still able to stand outside 8 taels. Because the foreign exchange market was once tight, He Yiqiu sought April US dollars at 25, and Hengxing bought them at 8 taels and 5 mace. Yuanheng, Qingfa, and Yong also purchased, still at 9 taels. But the market was laborious and declined. Daxing and Yong also took the opportunity to sell bars, and Hongli also offered within 39 taels. Fuyu sold out at around 7 taels and a half. At this time, the market within the field appeared quite sluggish, and the situation was pessimistic. Suddenly, the news of the Central Bank's cash opening flew in, like a stimulant. The price also rose. Yuanheng also entered, rising again to outside 8 taels and a half. Although Daxing and Yong offered, they were still able to struggle for a long time around the 8 taels mark. After this, little trading was heard from the banks. Although the market situation was peaceful, the general psychology of looking at the silver market overnight or rising led to pessimism again. Yuanmaoyong sold bars, and Hengxing also came to sell, but there was a lack of willing buyers. Retail investors followed suit, gradually decreasing to within 7 taels, at 6 taels and 8 mace. Because Daxing and Yong still came to sell. Bank foreign exchange rates were not affected. Fuyu came to enter, rising to 7 taels and 3 mace. Dadecheng also came to buy in. Hengxing and Yuanmaoyong limited the market to 7 taels and 6 mace to exit, showing a slight repelling. Tongfeng and Heng, although entering, did not see an increase. Hengchang and Yong took the opportunity to rent out bars. Buyers seemed to have the advantage, mutually seizing Hengxing and Yuanmaoyong's bars. The price then rose to outside 8 taels. Fushun then came to purchase, and retail short-sellers also slightly covered their positions. At this time, the buying wind was very strong. Spot numbers all had purchases. The general psychology considered that there would be another cash opening, and it reached 9 taels and 1 mace. The close was slightly lower by 3 mace, at 798 taels and 8 mace. Zhifeng, Yong, and others rented in, doing up to outside 9 taels. However, items were still auctioned at 8 taels and 8 mace. Hedging came out, and it was seen to decline again. The decline and stability in half a day had no storms. The highest price was 699 taels and 4 mace, and the lowest price was 795 taels and 8 mace, a difference of only 3 taels and 6 mace. The final result was a decline of 4 taels and 1 mace compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Strong Suppression of Four Taels</h3>
<p>The quoted price, because HSBC's listing did not change, and the US dollar was still calculated at 27 yuan 625, combined the gold price of 24,000 at 868 taels 7 mace 8 fen, the same as the previous day. However, because the gold price in this city was low, it was calculated at 69 taels 9 mace fen fen, which was a strong 4 taels more than the previous close. The January and February registered prices were both 801 taels, the March price was 799 taels, and the replenishment price was 801 taels.</p>
<h3>Trading is Not Prosperous</h3>
<p>Table trading statistics include buyers such as Yuanheng, Zhaofengchang, Yushunli, Hengxing, Tongfengheng, Hengchangyong, Qingfayong, Yifengshengda, etc. Sellers include Daxingyong, Zhifengyonghengyu, Hengxingyuanmaoyong, Rendechenghongli, Fushunruikang, etc. Daxingyong and Zhifengyong were the largest sellers, and Yuanheng was slightly more powerful on the buying side. Trading was not prosperous. The Dalian gang, such as Wanxing, first sold and then bought, while Shunli bought. The Guangdong gang, such as Hengxing, bought more and sold 7,000. Yifeng and Shengda both made few purchases. Although the Central Bank opened cash, the amount was not large, not as much as before.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange First Loosened Then Stabilized</h3>
<p>Although the London big bar in the foreign exchange market was a small 0.0625, and the silver price also fell by 0.125, the exchange rate fell by 75 and 5625. This was a reasonable matter. However, the forward silver price saw a rising wind, calculated to increase by 1 cent 2 and 5 cents, etc. American cotton also saw a rebound, and exceeded the price that fell the previous day. The market sentiment in the silver market tended to be strong as a result. The initial opening was low because the gold price was already small, so the British exchange near-term was between 1 shilling and 8 pence. The US dollar was also in the vicinity of 28 yuan. The gold market opened lower as a result, and although it saw a rebound, the exchange market was even looser. In addition, the Washington telegram had news of the issuance of 25 million subsidiary coins, which was even more loose and rampant. Fortunately, HSBC's listings of British and American currencies were not lengthened, and although it was not good, it did not cause another vortex. The market situation also slightly stabilized. The Central Bank opened cash and the gold price rose, so the exchange market was even more stable. The impersonation also trended to take in, and the gold industry mainly exited. Huabi扒出shillings, and Che Yang's Zhengjin took in, while Macari 扒美金, Other than this, both进出 were seen. British exchange had a 0.0625 review in half a day, while US dollars had a 125 advance and retreat. The situation in the middle of the market was first loose and then stable, and the situation was hovering. As a result, the British exchange was 0.0625 stronger than the previous close, and the US dollar was looser by about 125. Today, I will record the 进出 in half a day as follows.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The opening near-term was 1 shilling and 8 pence, which was 0.0625 stronger than the previous close. San Fei first exited January 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625, which was already loose at the time of opening, and was taken in by HSBC. Citibank sold to Zhengjin in the same month at the same price. Macari also 塞 January 0.0625. Zhengjin continued to 扒, Huabi運 out April 125, May 1875, and the closing price January 1 shilling and 8 pence,进一 shilling 8 pence 0.0625, February the same, March 出价0.0625,进价125, April.</p>
<p>(American) The opening near-term was read at 8 yuan, which was 125 stronger than the previous close. Zi Bank's private cable also reported an increase of 0.0625. The foot China bought in, and Huabi entered April read 8 yuan 25. Macari also 扒 April 25. He Yi Jin January 0.0625, which was 卖 by Huabi. It was already loose 0.0625 at the time of opening. Shanghai April 3125, Huabi also ate the same month at the same price. Hefeng ate February 125, Huabi and Anda both納 April 25, and the market situation was slightly calmer. Macari also ate April 25, and Citibank also entered the same month at the same price. The closing price was the opening price of January read 8 yuan, the opening price of read 8 yuan 0625, February 0625, the opening price 125, March 125, the opening price 1875, April 1875, the opening price 31 yuan 5. One US dollar is still equal to 3 taels 6 mace 1 fen 9 釐 9 釐 9 毫.</p>
<h3>Big Bar Long Zero Six Two Five</h3>
<p>国民社 Eighteenth, London Electric, the big bar is nearly and far long at zero six two five, calculated near-term at sixteen pence three seven five, far-term at sixteen pence nine three seven five, British-American exchange, opened at three yuan three corners four fen six two five.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Returned Silver Dollars Sold</h3>
<p>The Central Bank of China took in a lot</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of foreign transactions seemed more frequent, especially in the morning in the green money houses. The returned silver dollars from various places were crowded, but they were all seeking to sell in the market, and the number was no less than several million, but the recipients were few, and the situation suddenly appeared stagnant. As a result, the Bund Central China 收买,方得买卖抵平,然厚价之下落爲必然之事实, As for 收解货欵, because of the scarce year-end, and 结欵则反增多, the rest of the various electronic remittances and hot collections, etc., also belong to quite a few.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cents Fell Slightly, Silver Discounts Remained the Same</h3>
<p>One foreign cent One cent early market price Because the selling atmosphere was booming, the price tended to fall, and the form of buying and selling in the afternoon market was weak, so the cent price did not fluctuate much, the same as the early market, [Silver discount] Both the early and afternoon markets are still two points, and the line is still white, but the trend of the silver root is difficult, in the week of the lunar New Year, I am afraid there is no hope of a turnaround.</p>
<h3>Corners Continue to Small, Copper Coins Return Long</h3>
<p>Jiangnan Small foreign currency seemed good two 厘 in the early market, at six yuan three fen three 厘, and the afternoon market returned to the original price, at six yuan three fen one 厘. The transaction was nine thousand corners in the early market, and four thousand corners in the afternoon market. Guangdong Small foreign currency has had a slight source for several days, and the small money house has a 　積 款 to come out, and the market price is gradually declining. The early market was six yuan one fen six 厘, a small five 厘 from the early market the previous day. The afternoon market was slightly better by half a 厘, at six yuan one fen six and a half 厘. The transaction was one hundred thirty-five thousand corners in the early market, and thirty-five thousand corners in the afternoon market. Steel coins were released again for two thousand five hundred texts, at three hundred seventy-six thousand five hundred texts. There was more than ten thousand taels of silver as the price silver for the transaction.</p>
<h3>Silver 收解 垫 结 款 Extraordinarily Many</h3>

<h3>Inland River Ice Break Rice Prices Up 20 Cents</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) The inland river is frozen, and only ten boats have arrived. In addition, the snowflakes are flying, and the people's hearts are upward. The market situation has risen sharply. The retail city-country store 　冒 is slightly felt, 　冒 only five or six hundred stones, because of the small arrival, Su Tong and the Chang Gang green corners, the South Port and other gang pumps of goods are extremely tight, and the price has risen by two corners. 变　元 also shows signs of improvement. Du Yangjian is still not on the market, and the pump is not thick. If the inland river is frozen or the snowflakes continue to fly, the market situation will not be twisted at the end of the year, and there will definitely be hope for a turnaround.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) There are few sources from the river, and the white glutinous rice store 　貨　 is dull, the middle section is more popular, the secondary goods are not bad, and the market is high and stable, secondary 　Feet outside, The arrival and sale of Bo Geng early rice are both good, and the situation is fixed, and the sales of Yangjian are less active, and the price is increased by four or five corners. Du Jian and Bu Jian are also firmly one foot outside, 　 Jian is also added one or two corners, The arrival of 白元 is scarce, and the store 　 applications are in urgent need, and the price rises sharply by six or seven corners.</p>
<h3>Powder Wheat Exchange Scarce, Market Good</h3>
<p>The powder market presents a firm and stable image, with foreign returns good for one or two corners, although there is little change, the people's hearts are 　 seen to be fixed, and the end of this month is in sight, and every family is short, and there are still supplements, the good reason is that there is a lack of ready-made powder, and the eyes must be illuminated 　 accurately increase the price, and it is not possible to make up for it. For the distant months, because 　 the gang slightly handled the entry, and the floating empty also bought the supplement, the turnover of each disk, although 　 few, the situation is slightly tight, because the end of the year is the end of the year, and the short and long are settled mostly, but 　 Chi does not move, and the market atmosphere is stable and good. As a result, this month's closing price rose by two eight　from the previous day's closing price, two eight six in February, one point two 厘 half in March, two 厘 half in April, and one point in May and June.</p>
<p>People 　 presents a steady image in the wheat market. There is only one transaction this month, and I have heard 　, whether it is delivered, I don't know yet, in the distant future, the short and the long are watching, but the quotation of foreign wheat, slightly good for one or two corners, the set of the sect, also has not come out, the people's hearts are slightly tight, as a result, this month is not opened, February is better than the previous day by two points, and March and April are better by two points.</p>
<h3>客秈 Transactions Gradually Become Scarce</h3>
<p>丨Foreign Rice May Have An Agreement丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the inter-banking of 秈 inter-conversion was active, and the market was slightly higher, but the cargo owners all intended to use the Red Plate for sale, and no high-priced goods were sold, and the front 　見 Stop, the back market seems to have a stiffening trend, and the import of 闽 帮 is also not very poor, and the price is slightly 闽　, and the price is high, and then stop and watch, and this 　 is the same as other gangs There is no intention to handle it, this back city 　 will inevitably become clearer and clearer, and it will probably have a development prospect until the 阴　 new year. Yesterday, 900 bags of Jiangxi machine evening were opened, and the price was 9 yuan and 1 corner and 8 yuan and 9 corners. 　 200 bags of machine oil, the price is 9 yuan and 2 corners, 　 rice telegram is suitable, and the group and the military 　 have the transfer of the order, and there may be a transaction within the day, but the experts take the previous car as a lesson and dare not ask for their own news.</p>
<h3>Yellow Beans and Soybean Oil Had No Honor or Disgrace</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean export gang still had the drag, so the market situation was slightly higher, and the cargo owners' minds were slightly more stable at the end of the year, and there was a lack of formal market prices. It is estimated that the export gang traded 710 西城黄豆, 550 bags of 崇明沙黄豆, and the 浦东杜豆 was only in the moving room of this street, and only 1 or 200 bags were traded yesterday, and there was no major change in the various goods in the year.</p>
<p>The oil market is still stable, and although the experts have returned, the source is also continuous, and the situation is two enemies, and there is no honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Group Turns Up</h3>

<p>Metal</p>
<h3>Tinplate Pricing Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, heavy snow fell, and the hardware market was very quiet. The trading of various goods also presented a desolate scene due to the approaching end of the year. Therefore, apart from foreign silver dollars and foreign silver dollar heads, and foreign plates and foreign plate heads, which had significant transactions throughout the city, there were few other goods. However, overseas iron from Zhoukou saw a continuous increase of up to one pence. For example, 90-pound ICW was 16 shillings and 8 pence per box, and double-jointed was 34 shillings and 4 pence. 100-pound items were all higher by one shilling and five pence per box. It is reported that more than 3,000 boxes were traded yesterday, which are futures contracts for shipments in February and March.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 17th, steel was slightly weak, while tin and zinc both rose slightly. Antimony remained at £18 10s per ton (Chinese goods) and 10s 2d. A New York dispatch on the same day reported that steel prices remained unchanged at $5.00.</p>
<h3>Method for Identifying Japanese White Iron</h3>
<p>There are four types of white iron circulating in the Chinese market: British, American, Belgian, and Japanese. The most popular at first were British and American goods, followed by Belgian goods, and then Japanese goods. Later, the Osaka Metal Co., Ltd. and other factories produced a large amount of white iron, which was promoted in China. Due to geographical advantages and various other reasons, they gradually seized the market share of British and American goods and replaced them. Since the anti-Japanese boycott after the September 18th Incident, this trend has slightly decreased. However, there are still a small number of merchants who only know profit and do not know how to avenge national humiliation, so they secretly resell it after disguising it. Because of the lack of identification skills, they are often cheated, which is lamentable. Here is a brief description of the characteristics that can be used to identify Japanese white iron, so that patriotic merchants know how to choose.</p>
<p>Japanese white iron is mostly packaged in rolls and tied with straw, with few flat packages. Therefore, most of the white iron sold has a curved shape. 1. Japanese white iron has very thin zinc plating, and often there is a large area that is not plated at all. Therefore, the flower patterns are very few, the brightness is low, the color is mostly dark, the weight is light, and rust marks are common, with many inferior traces. 2. The brand names are very small, and each roll only has a brand printed on the top sheet; the rest are unmarked. The popular brands on the market are "Yofang" (洋房), "Taiyang" (太陽), "Xingyue" (星月), "Sanxing" (三星), and "Shouhuobi" (手火筆). There are also "Hongniao" (紅鳥) and "Huixing" (慧星) brands, but the strokes are very fine, so they are still easy to identify.</p>

<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Coarse Granulated Sugar Rises by Five Cents</h3>
<p>| Build | Bottom | Missing | Good |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained sluggish and flat. The Association’s preliminary quotation for No. 24 coarse granulated sugar was 15 taels and 7.5 mace. However, due to limited sales, the market tightened, resulting in a rise of five cents. Changxing Firm sold 100 bags at a price of 15 taels and 8 mace. There were few transactions for No. 18 and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar, as well as No. 80 and No. 90 Dutch red sugar. Market prices did not fluctuate much. Yesterday, Zhang Diaoqing of Jianbang Da Zhanghua Company continued to sell 120 bags at 9 taels and 5.5 mace. As Jianbing is out of stock, merchants are generally unwilling to sell. The market is expected to tighten. Diaoqing and Jianqing are gradually arriving, so the price will not rise sharply for the time being. The customers all hope that the spring market will turn upward.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 17th, spot sugar remained at 7.1875 cents. Futures for December remained unchanged, March was up by two points, and May and September were up by one point each. According to a London dispatch on the same day, March fell slightly by one penny to 4.10.25, May fell by 0.75 to 4.2.75, and August fell by 1.25 pence to 4.2.25. Javanese white sugar remained unchanged at 7.9.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Orchid Seeds, High-Quality Goods Scarce</h3>
<p>Trading Floor Raises Price by Three Taels</p>
<p>Recently, orchid seeds have been scarce. High-quality, all-yellow goods from the current winter harvest are becoming increasingly scarce. Only one merchant in the market still has some stock. Therefore, the trading floor has raised the price by about three taels. Ordinary goods have not yet been cleared, but merchants are unwilling to lower the price too much. It is expected that if sales pick up in the spring market, there will be good prospects.</p>
<h3>Spring Bubble Rounds Arriving Sparsely</h3>
<p>Spring bubble rounds have become increasingly scarce. The market is also stabilizing. The goods available are limited. Most likely merchants will wait for the spring market to open for trading again. It is reported that the He’an Wheel arrived with another batch from Spring yesterday, totaling less than 200 boxes.</p>

<h3>A Madman (1)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Being a small village, the news of Yu Lao Si, who lived in the east, going mad, spread throughout the entire village in a single morning. The news was peculiar, why would such a villain suddenly go mad? But everyone said it was absolutely true; because the news was from Gou'er's mother who lived next door to Wang Lao Si, who told everyone the news when she was washing clothes in front of Liu Qing's house in the village. She was an honest and kind person who would never say anything wrong, and at the time, her eyes were still glistening with dry tears, so the news was very reliable. At that time, the cowherd Er Lai Li of the village chief's family was washing vegetables by the ditch, and when he heard such interesting news, he was so happy that he ran and jumped back, and without even putting down the vegetable basket, he shouted loudly; [Hey, Wang Lao Si is mad...]. As a result, all the people in the village chief's residence immediately knew the news. Even Wu Daye, who was on the opium couch at the moment, also heard about it from Mrs. Wu's mouth.</p>
<p>[Oh? Really... Wang Lao Si is mad?]</p>
<p>Wu Daye pulled the opium pipe out of his mouth, endured his breath, took a sip of hot tea, spat out the residue, then glanced at Mrs. Wu with his eyes, intentionally or unintentionally responding, while scraping the iron needle on the opium pipe a few times, preparing to load the second opium pellet. Afterwards, he added a sentence;</p>
<p>[But why did he go mad]?</p>
<p>Mrs. Wu had no way to answer, and was very ashamed, even she did not know the [why]. But since Wu Daye was so enthusiastic, of course Mrs. Wu had to find out. The only way was to call out to Er Lai Li, because the sentence was passed down by Er Lai Li.</p>
<p>[Er Lai Li, do you know why Wang Lao Si went mad]?</p>
<p>[I don't know].</p>
<p>[Didn't you spread this news? Why don't you know]?</p>
<p>[Yes, I got it from Gou'er's mother, and she didn't say what the illness was either. According to people, maybe he disturbed the Mountain God Tai Sui when he moved the pig pen].</p>
<p>Since Mrs. Wu had already come to the kitchen, of course everyone did not make much noise. Later, she said;</p>
<p>[Hmph, it's really unexpected, who would have known that he would go mad? When he came to pay the rent the day before yesterday, wasn't he still a good person]?</p>
<p>[Yes], Mr. Zhen Fang of the Wu residence was washing his face, and at this moment he hurriedly raised his head, his face full of water droplets, and white heat rising from his hair, smiling and said to Mrs. Wu; [If it weren't for the Master teaching me to force him to pay the rent he owed, would we still be able to collect it today since he's gone mad]?</p>
<p>[Hmm, that's right. But Wu Lao Si's character is not bad, he has always been law-abiding, I didn't expect him to get such a terrible disease].</p>
<p>Mrs. Wu said and went into the room. Er Lai Li was still listening to her mouth chanting [Amitabha]. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Schools and Markets</h3>
<p>— Yu Xuan</p>
<p>In a capitalist society, everything is commodified, and naturally, education is no exception.</p>
<p>The barter era has long passed, and goods must pass through the market before they can be traded with each other; the spirit of the Sophists no longer exists, and education must have schools before it can be taught and received.</p>
<p>Ignoring the needs of consumers and only calculating the accumulation of profits is the essence of the modern market; ignoring the effectiveness of courses and only knowing how to collect fees on time is also the characteristic of the current so-called schools.</p>
<p>The storefront is covered with slogans that say [Global goods, everything is available], but [without money, you can't even think about it]; the newspapers are full of school enrollment advertisements that say [Well-equipped, dedicated teaching], but [those who have not paid the fees are not allowed to enter the school]. This is indeed a fitting contrast.</p>
<p>Now, money controls supreme power, invading the core of all human activities. With money, [everything goes smoothly], without money, [it is difficult to get through one day]. Therefore, the market is a place for competing for profit, and schools have also become a place for making money. Students pay fees to obtain qualifications, and teachers take money to make a living and support their families. Those who teach do not necessarily teach diligently, and those who listen still look down upon it as usual. Superiors and inferiors mix with each other, teachers and students deceive each other, trade and retreat, each gets what they want, just like the market! What about the school? Naturally, in a capitalist society, the common people only have the freedom to run errands and starve. However, running errands is still okay, but starving is a bit uncomfortable. How can one not starve? The only way is to [find money]. There are many ways to find money, from prostitution to becoming an official, they are all methods. What kind of goods you have, what kind of shop you open, of course, is also a great way to make money, and thus schools are established everywhere, and then education develops! In this way, the school becoming a market is also inevitable and a matter of course, so why be surprised?</p>
<p>Here, I am not saying that education is a noble and sacred career and should transcend time and space and be independent, but I am proving that education is just a superstructure constructed on a certain economic foundation, and it changes with the changes in the economic foundation. The imperial examination and the school are just products reflecting the consciousness of two different eras. Therefore, the marketization of schools today is also a phenomenon that is bound to occur in a capitalist society.</p>
<p>The fundamental reform does not lie in the so-called education programs and school systems, but in the transformation of the entire economic organization of the current society.</p>
<p>Truly perfect schools can only be established under a rational social system!</p>
<h3>Fireside Chat</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>I accidentally opened Wang Zhongqu's "Smoke and Mist Over Ten Thousand Ancient Towers Collection" and saw a poem he showed to his three-year-old son Shancai, and found it extremely interesting, so I copied it below.</p>
<p>Shancai is twenty-five months old, and knows more than two hundred and fifty characters. I showed him a poem saying;</p>
<p>Father recognized a thousand characters at the age of four, understood the meaning of each written form. Son, you are three years old now and know two hundred characters. I will definitely establish something unique for you in the future. The world recognizes characters and the heavens sneer, your father was misled and is still misleading you, son. Son, don't learn from your father! Knowing books, mother says, is good, but being hungry to death will leave you with no one to protect you. Are Yi and Qi’s temple incense, only for swaying hands to pray? Your father gets two meals, relying on you to sprinkle libations in the courtyard. The Emperor Qin burned books black as charcoal, Boyi swallowed them but they were not to eat, fish and salt can make you prime minister, robbery can make you a general, worldly fame lies in peddling. Haven't you heard that when Cangjie created characters, ghosts and gods cried, and since then, literati have been in a state of shock. Haven't you also heard that Emperor Xuan Yuan Huang Di did not use a single character, and Feng Hou and Li Mu became ministers.</p>
<p>Wang Zhongqu's talent was not recognized, and his poems are like Sima Qian's essays. He once lived in seclusion with his wife Jin Qiuhong in Wang'an, between Liang Masheng outside Wulin in Hangzhou, but now no one knows the site of this Wang'an. My friend Chen [no info] He wrote a chronology for him, but stopped halfway due to lack of material. Every time he talked about the sentence [The remaining son of Jiangdong, Lao Wanglang, holds a pipa and cries for the Great King], he was still full of enthusiasm, saying that one day he would compile the chronology of this Wang Zhongqu.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Words of sorrow are easy to work with, which is also a natural trend. Because people's emotions are relaxed when they are happy, and tense when they are sad. He who eats beside the bereaved is never full; the infection of sorrow is of course faster and more intimate than happiness. Li Houzhu's poems after the fall of the country are simply filled with tears, and no matter who reads them cannot help but be heartbroken. Compared with the early [Flowers bright, moon dark, dragon light mist], of course [More hate for last night's dream] is much better. There is also the state of mind of appreciating literature. Chinese people and foreigners seem to be slightly different. Foreigners seem to focus on art for art’s sake when discussing literature. For example, when foreigners read Byron's poems, they completely ignore the poets' incestuous and immoral private lives. But when Chinese people read Wen Tianxiang and Yue Wumu's poems, the first thing they think of is the background of these authors' personalities. From this point of view, tragedy is easier to succeed than comedy. Yan Song and Ruan Dacheng's poems are not bad, but no one reads them because their personalities are filthy and cannot form a tragic and beautiful background.</p>
<h3>Literary Women's Liberation</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the literature of any era is closely related to the actual life of the same era, so the surging women's liberation movement in recent years has its own obvious reflection in literature. In a feudal society where men occupied an absolute advantage, they occupied all of the economy, so women, who were in a subordinate position, had to devote themselves to men like slaves in exchange for their supply of bread, so they had to maintain chastity for husbands who were prostitutes or committed adultery, and had to endure all deceptions and oppressions. However, there were also some reactions at the time, such as Ibsen's "A Doll's House" as a literary example. In the same era, "Ghosts" and "The Lady from the Sea" also talked about the issue of women's liberation. Later, there was Shaw's "Mrs. Warren's Profession", which was stimulating for women's awakening. Then, where exactly can Nora, who resolutely leaves the sweet call of [My darling, my little bird] in order to gain independence of personality, go? Can she live independently? "Mrs. Warren's Profession"’s Vivi seems to answer this question. She cannot agree with her mother Warren's view; […Girls from good families are raised to seek the appreciation of a rich man, marry him, and enjoy his wealth, what else can they do? …] [All we have are our faces and the ability to serve men…], but what she can answer her mother is […Everyone has the opportunity to choose a profession…choose picking cloth or selling flowers according to their own preferences…if they can't find existing ones, they should create them themselves]. Of course, Vivi is indeed more advanced than Nora. In this way, they broke through the fortress built by men with prejudice, entered the office, knocked on the door of the factory, and lived an independent life like men. As Kolontai tells us in "The New Woman"; [We can see these single women performing research institute experiments at the work table, organizing materials in the library, and engaging in intense duties in the hospital].</p>
<p>However, in general capitalist countries, most women are doing the same work as men, but cannot get the same remuneration as men, and cannot escape the prison of the family, so they are hoping for a better society, which is expressed in [The Working Woman Marita] by [no info] Bitman and [The Diary of a Wanderer] by Gorky.</p>
<p>As for the new women in the new society, they are completely liberated from all the old shackles, and many examples can be found in the literary works of the new Russia, and they completely express true freedom in literature.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Times and Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>[Go to that park]?</p>
<p>[How about going to Hongkou Park]?</p>
<p>She asked for his consent. To go to Hongkou Park, you have to walk through the sphere of influence of the Japanese adults, you have to walk in front of the headquarters of the Japanese Marines, you have to see the Japanese sailors with beast-like fierce eyes, you have to see the armored vehicles, the fierce weapons prepared to kill Chinese people. At the same time, Lian thought of seeing the Japanese patrolmen fiercely beating Chinese rickshaw pullers that night, and he really didn't want to go to the Hongkou area.</p>
<p>He hesitated and did not agree for a while.</p>
<p>[You don't like going to Hongkou Park? I don't want to go either. But, I want to go there to buy some gifts to take back to them]</p>
<p>Japan.</p>
<p>[Isn't it good to go to Brahma Ferry Park? That place is more like a park]</p>
<p>[Okay. Then I'll go buy it for them tomorrow].</p>
<p>[Are they really going back to Japan]?</p>
<p>[If they don't go back, what are they doing here? Who's going to support them? … That little head might stay with us for another month and a half, until he finds a job. …]</p>
<p>[She came to Shanghai to find a job]?</p>
<p>Hearing that only the Japanese guy was going back, and that beautiful Japanese girl could still stay here, this seemed to fit what he had hoped for. He thought, then before Mr. Zeng comes back, two beauties will be having dinner with me every day.</p>
<p>Coming out of the post office, I originally wanted to take a bus to the end of Jing'an Temple Road, and then take a trolleybus from the end of Jing'an Temple to Brahma Ferry Park. He didn't expect Mrs. Tsuruko to be so bourgeois. She insisted on hiring a car. Although she said she would pay the fare, Haiquan was embarrassed to see her slowly unlocking her handbag. Men do things more quickly than women anyway. Probably he also didn't want Mrs. Tsuruko to suspect that he was a stingy person. He finally paid one dollar and fifty cents first.</p>
<p>[It's four times more expensive than taking the tram or bus!]</p>
<p>He thought after paying the money.</p>
<p>[……It's too stupid to come out with her today. I haven't seen the benefit yet, but I've seen the harm.]</p>
<p>But sitting shoulder to shoulder with her on the soft cushion in the car felt very comfortable and pleasant. Every time the car vibrated, her shoulder would touch his shoulder. Although there were layers of clothes in between, he felt a kind of warmth. Later, he even hated that the roads in the concession were too flat.</p>
<p>He unintentionally stretched out his hand and pointed to the dust stained on the corner of his coat.</p>

<h3>Feet Better Than Hands</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuan</p>
<p>Although I am studying journalism, I haven't flipped through a single journalism book in a semester (this is a good student). Today, because I have an exam, I took a journalism book from the bookshelf for the sake of credits, wiped off the dust, and flipped through it. When I opened the book, there was a creed for interviewers: [Feet are better than hands]. The general idea is that when interviewing for news, in addition to relying on hands to write articles, the most important thing is the [walking] of feet.</p>
<p>I think this is not only a creed that news reporters should believe in and abide by, but also a secret to success in life for ordinary people. For example, if you know a high-ranking official of the party and the state, a famous scholar, a manager, or a comprador, you may as well go around more often and flatter them. For example, in school sports elections, whatever committee of the student self-government association, you also have to visit and visit more often. It is more reliable to visit fellow students than to put up slogans.</p>
<p>There are many such examples. The two above are just picked up at random.</p>
<p>In short, to put it all together, for those who are beneficial to you, regardless of whether he is a bastard, a traitor, a national thief, a local tyrant, an evil gentry, a rogue scholar...all of this does not matter, as long as he is beneficial to you, you may as well go more often. Go around, don't be afraid of listening to the complaints of his doorman or the contempt of his servant. You will eventually go around, which is good and beneficial.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that [Feet are better than hands] is not only a creed that we journalism students should never forget and always keep in mind, but also a secret for ordinary people to deal with the world. This is what I have learned from studying journalism, but I dare not secretly pass it on to my descendants for eighteen generations to prepare for selling it as an ancestral secret recipe for eighteen generations in the future, so I specially publish it here for friends who are interested in [becoming officials] [getting rich] to refer to.</p>

<h3>Simple Method for Detecting Preservatives in Milk</h3>
<p>— [no info]</p>
<p>See the article [Talking about Milk] published in this journal, which is very beneficial to readers; and the addition of preservatives to milk (whether fresh or other types) is indeed a very common thing. It is important to know that any preservative in milk is harmful and not beneficial, so I have specially drafted this article for your reference.</p>
<p>The preservatives commonly used in milk are formalin, sodium bicarbonate, salicylic acid, boric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium dichromate.</p>
<p>Formalin is often added to fresh milk. Take five cubic centimeters of fresh milk, add two cubic centimeters of a thousand-fold diluted solution of phloroglucinol; shake vigorously, then add two cubic centimeters of light sodium hydroxide. If the milk contains formalin, it will appear a colorful reddish-brown. If not, it will be bluish-white. This method is very effective, even if formalin is diluted to 1,000,000 times in milk, it can still be detected.</p>
<p>Sodium bicarbonate: Evaporate twenty cubic centimeters of fresh milk or ten grams of condensed milk to dryness (milk powder users do not need to do this procedure), then burn it with strong heat until the organic matter is completely oxidized, leaving only a white residue. Dissolve the residue in water, then add a few drops of litmus solution. If it turns blue, it can prove that there is soda or other alkaline substances, but among alkaline substances, only sodium bicarbonate is used as a preservative. To know the amount, you can use sulfuric acid to drip until it is colorless, and then multiply by 0.042 to get the amount.</p>
<p>Salicylic acid: Also known as salicylic acid, this substance is the most harmful among preservatives. Add fifty cubic centimeters of milk to fifty cubic centimeters of acidic potassium sulfate and five cubic centimeters of alcohol (95%) to obtain a precipitate. Filter to remove it. Add fifty cubic centimeters of benzene to the filtrate, place it in a separatory funnel, shake it, and let it stand until the two liquids separate. Remove the water layer, pour out the benzene liquid, and evaporate it. If the milk contains salicylic acid, add five cubic centimeters of neutral ferric chloride to wait for a purple-red color.</p>
<p>Boric acid: Heat the milk or milk powder with hot water, filter it, take the filtrate, place it in a separatory funnel, add ether and shake it, then the ether can absorb the fatty substances. Separate the water layer, place it in an evaporating dish, and heat it to evaporate to dryness, then burn the organic matter away with strong heat. Add an equal amount of potassium methyl sulfate to the remaining ash, mix, and burn it in a dry test tube. If there is boric acid, the gas emitted will ignite with a beautiful green color.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide: This substance, like formalin, is often added to fresh milk. Add a few drops of wound-healing wood to five cubic centimeters of milk. If the milk contains hydrogen peroxide, it will turn reddish-brown.</p>
<p>Potassium dichromate: This substance is yellow and is often added to milk powder and condensed milk, so it is not obvious. The milk powder or condensed milk can be burned with strong heat to remove the organic matter, and the remaining ash that is yellow is evidence of the presence of potassium dichromate. If the content is small, it cannot be seen in the ash. Wash it with water, add two cubic centimeters of dilute sulfuric acid (dilute sulfuric acid dissolved in ten times the water) and two drops of hydrogen peroxide. Finally, place it in a separatory funnel, add ten cubic centimeters of ether and shake it. If the ether turns blue, there is evidence of potassium dichromate.</p>
<h3>A Snow Game</h3>
<p>— Dao Sheng</p>
<p>丨丨A Scene from Middle School Life丨丨</p>
<p>Upon waking in the morning, I pushed open the window and saw the ground covered with a thick layer of snow, a gleaming white silver world. The northwest wind was still howling furiously, but the snow had stopped falling. The sky was covered in thick, dark clouds, offering no warmth.</p>
<p>It happened to be Sunday, with no classes and the big exams still far off. The accumulated cold had reached the point where water turned to ice, but for young middle school students, this snowy weather wasn't unbearably cold. So, after breakfast, one by one, the young people emerged from their warm studies and, as if by agreement, scattered into the courtyard to play snow games: snowball fights and building snowmen.</p>
<p>Young people are full of curiosity and a spirit of adventure, finding everything fun and interesting. In the eyes of the forty-something-year-old dormitory supervisor and a few elderly professors, these young students playing with snow in the snow were simply crazy, or a bunch of silly pigs. Although the result of building snowmen and having snowball fights would leave every young person's hands red with cold and their cheeks like apples, what the young people felt was enjoyment and happiness.</p>
<p>In the roughly two-acre rectangular courtyard, there were hundreds of young students in clusters here and there. Building snowmen was mostly done by the female students. Groups of three or four, they worked hard to pile up snow next to withered flower trees, under the eaves, and in more secluded spots, creating statues of the teachers and staff, or building Buddha figures. A few male students, usually known as artists, used the snow as plaster and gently carved it with bamboo strips, practicing their sculpting skills. The rest were all warriors in the snowball fight, and I was one of them. The so-called snowball fight had no orderly lines and no fixed enemies. The bullets were tightly packed snowballs. Everyone was in chaos, hitting me, I was throwing at him, white spherical objects flying all over the sky, it was quite interesting, with the cheers of the victors mixed with the curses of the hit, making a lot of noise.</p>
<p>I was hit several times by Little Li, one blow landing on my face, causing a dull pain. Although I hated it, there was nothing I could do. No matter how accurately I aimed, his monkey-like agility allowed him to dodge skillfully, always leaving me throwing at empty air. Once,</p>
<p>I was so focused on chasing him that I didn't notice a statue of a goddess next to the pomegranate tree. I knocked its head off, and suddenly Old Wang jumped out from the side, blocking my way. He loudly said to me; [Little Zhang! I can't let you off this time, quickly compensate me]; I saw that the goddess's head had fallen and was unrecognizably disfigured, so I had to shake off Old Wang's hand and run away like smoke, my attitude was very embarrassed. However, Little Li still didn't let me off, and seeing my embarrassed state, he stealthily followed closely behind. When I turned around to chase him again, I saw him raise his hand, and I was hit squarely again, on my right leg. Enraged, I grabbed a handful of snow from the ground and threw it hard, but I didn't know that this throw would cause even more trouble. It didn't hit Little Li, but instead landed squarely on Miss Ping's head, who was building a Buddha, instantly turning Miss Ping's artistic black hair white. I had no choice but to walk forward under Miss Ping's angry gaze, like a criminal walking to the judge to confess. First, I gave a smile, stood at attention, and then gave a military salute to apologize. I said, [I'm sorry! Miss! I'm willing to accept your strictest punishment]. That prankster, taking advantage of my lack of preparedness, stuffed a pair of wet, icy hands into my neck, making me scream. Little Li sang from afar; [Shouldn't have, shouldn't have, Little Zhang's snowball hit Miss Ping's head. ...]</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>This happened three years ago when I was studying at XX Middle School in Jiangwan. Recently, I have not only dropped out of school, but I am also a member of the unemployed masses, and my youthful spirit has been almost completely extinguished. Under the oppression of the severe cold, sitting listlessly in the attic, watching the snowflakes dance outside, I can't help but tremble! Recalling the past, I yearn for it with a sigh!</p>
<h3>With a Calm Attitude, Why Are the Three Sea Customs Playing Tricks Again?</h3>
<h3>Selling Sensuality</h3>
<p>— Qun</p>
<p>Say to a concubine's friend, [Not specializing is great]. Say to a friend who enjoys women; [Eating and sex are human nature]. The Chinese people deceive themselves and others in solving sexual problems. In this era of rampant human desires, friends who want to get rich should take advantage of using [sex] to attract people, which is more cost-effective than buying horse racing tickets. Highly skilled methods include going to different ports and seducing women with better appearances to sell themselves. Once they open a port, they can live a life of pleasure for a while. Each port also has a network of human flesh trafficking organizations that buy these poor women who don't even know they've been tricked, forcing them to sell their bodies to satisfy their private desires. Day after day, year after year, the business of selling sex in big cities progresses faster than anything else. Besides public institutions, there are also private companies. Young ladies from good families and daughters of wealthy families all want to speculate and earn some extra money. As long as they have an experienced guide, they can become intimate guests. But the era has moved from 1933 to 1933. Friends who take concubines and enjoy women still take concubines and enjoy women. However,</p>
<p>the concubines they have taken and the women they have enjoyed can't just casually enter institutions and companies to make money. The times tell you that men have already possessed you, unless you run into a major law firm, otherwise the law will judge you (I saw in a magazine that the new criminal law of a certain island stipulates that married women - I don't know if concubines are included in this example? - who have private affairs behind their husbands' backs will also be sentenced to imprisonment). Therefore, the new business of 1933 is [Selling Sensuality]. Don't you see that in the advertisements of movie theaters, no matter what kind of movie it is, they can all pile up words like sensual, sexy, decadent, and bone-chilling to tempt friends who take concubines and enjoy women to have sexual urges, and the snow-white silver dollars roll into the boss's private pocket. You need to know that [sensuality] is just to clearly display the contours of your body, allowing drooling friends to appreciate it like scratching an itch through boots. You have no loss of reputation or physical harm, and snow-white Zhongshan Yuan heads can roll into your pockets. But it's best to go to a dance troupe for a few months of training to correct your weaknesses, such as having too small hips. And use your own characteristics, such as gently swaying your willow waist. After that, just go to public places, raise your hand, cross your legs, and immediately there will be friends with erotic obsessions who will treat you like their parents. Moreover, it is more magical than donating flowers in a formal way, hanging up a sign, and setting up a room. With both beauty and advantage, why not sell [sensuality], comrades?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Na Fu</p>
<p>(I) Someone's older brother and sister-in-law have been married for two years. Recently, I don't know why, they often quarrel over small things. She impatiently said to her mother; [Mom, why don't you make two new sets of wedding dresses and have my brother and sister-in-law get married again from scratch].</p>
<p>(II) Somewhere there was an examination for private tutors. The topic for the Party Ideology subject was; What is the Three Principles of the People? One of the private tutors answered; The Three Principles of the People are Sun Wen, Hu Hanmin, and Song Ziwen. (III) A woman quarreled with her son. The woman angrily scolded; [Bastard, you try dying for two days and see if I hate you]?</p>
<p>(IV) A woman happily said to people; [My daughter is only eighteen years old this year and already knows how to cook leftovers]!</p>

<h3>The Stepmother Problem</h3>
<p>Editor Mr.;</p>
<p>Yesterday, my old friend Mr. Yu told me about a case of a stepmother abusing a girl; it was hair-raising to hear, so I specially transcribed it below, hoping that it will also win your sympathy, and then please point out a way to liberation. (The following is Mr. Yu's conversation)</p>
<p>[My neighbor's surname is Wang, and he has a daughter; her name is A Jin, and she is only nine years old this year. When she was six years old, heaven took away her loving mother, and in less than a year, a woman around thirty years old came to be her stepmother; since then, she hasn't had a good day].</p>
<p>[Before dawn, she gets up to fetch water, boil water, sweep the floor, cook porridge, and serve her stepmother, which is her daily work, and this stepmother has a very full demeanor 丨even the tea water has to be delivered to her hand丨 Sometimes if the tea water is too cold or too hot, she will say that she doesn't want to do it, intentionally causing trouble, lightly scolding, heavily beating,]</p>
<p>[After completing the morning affairs, she goes to buy groceries, and there is not a day when problems don't arise when she returns home 丨the things are not good, the price is too expensive, she loafed outside, she skimmed from the change丨 endless quibbling].</p>
<p>[In the afternoon, she has to wash clothes; not today saying that the washing is not clean, then tomorrow saying that the soap is too wasteful,]</p>
<p>[In short, regardless of the size of the matter, no matter whether this nine-year-old girl can handle it, she has to do it, and as a result, apart from leftovers and scolding, don't expect her to have any share,]</p>
<p>[Her father goes out and works, and comes back once or twice a year; after hearing this long-tongued woman's telling, he can't help but become an accomplice, to win the pleasure of the Jade Emperor, so poor A Jin's body has no intact spot!] (omitted below)</p>
<h3>Zhong Bingzhang respectfully bows</h3>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>Editor's note; From birth, people have the right to be protected by law. Therefore, when someone's life and health are harmed by anyone (including biological parents), they can ask the court for protection. A Jin's situation, although it does not directly harm her life, can be believed to harm her health, so her maternal relatives such as her maternal grandmother and maternal uncle 丨 can collect evidence, (both testimonial and material evidence are good) and request to take her away to raise her, and the cost of raising her can be borne by her father; this is an obligation that he cannot easily shirk, but you cannot ask for too much, exceeding the scope of her father's economic capacity.</p>
<p>The above is just a solution for Wang A Jin's individual case. As for stepmothers in our country's families who can live in peace, there are only ten out of a hundred. There are indeed many cases of stepmothers abusing children, but there are also cases of children teasing stepmothers. Furthermore, a man who loses his wife in middle age and leaves behind many minor children must remarry; therefore, stepmothers in Chinese society have become a problem worth studying. I hope that readers will, based on what they know, weigh the facts, good or bad, of all aspects of this issue, such as the father, stepmother, daughters, relatives of the former wife, relatives of the later wife, and unrelated relatives and neighbors, and publish them. We will add comments after each fact; and finally hope to find a conclusion.</p>

<p>Declaration of Expelling a Destructive Adopted Son</p>
<p>Adopted son Mao Sheng has a bad nature, willingly indulges in vulgarity, and has been repeatedly taught, but it is difficult to transform him. Recently, he has become even more intensified, daring to steal property and insult elders, which is extremely unlawful 丨 I, as a widow, have no way to discipline this inferior son. I have no choice but to sever the relationship between mother and son to prevent future troubles. Hereafter, all of Mao Sheng's actions outside have nothing to do with my Xia surname, and I hope that all my relatives and friends will abandon him 丨 If there are any situations such as borrowing money under my name, I will not recognize them. This is a special declaration. Xia Airuohua respectfully announces</p>
<p>Sang Aqiang, sitting on a long bench, discovered this eye-catching advertisement on the cover of the newspaper and couldn't help but jump up.</p>
<p>[They actually put on this reverse play]!</p>
<p>The seven or eight garment workers, who were bowing their heads and working on the workbench, were startled by Aqiang's sudden action; but they did not dare to ask him the reason. Because he was the owner of the garment shop, like an officer in the army, they were all the employees he hired, like soldiers under the command of the officer. Although Boss Sang was the owner of a modest garment shop, he managed his employees as strictly as the army, so when they saw the boss's abnormal behavior, they could only stare at each other to express the confusion hidden in their hearts. At the same time, everyone looked back at the face of the proprietress, who was shelling broad beans. This was a public election for her to ask. [What's the matter, making such a fuss]?</p>

<h3>The Filming Process of "Grand Hotel"</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>(Part 1) Golding's Diplomatic Skills</p>
<p>"Grand Hotel" is a masterpiece of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1932 and has now arrived in Shanghai. It is said that it will be released at the Cathay Theatre in early February. Now, let me introduce some of its story.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a hotel manager, and one day a hurried secretary runs to tell you that Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, Lionel Barrymore, and John Barrymore are all registering at the same time. Who can you give the most luxurious room, the most attentive service, and the most attention to?</p>
<p>This was the difficult situation that Edmund Goulding was in when he took the microphone and prepared to shoot [Grand Hotel] at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.</p>
<p>Goulding thought to himself; [They should get the same quality of room, the same service, and the same attention.]</p>
<p>When this film was being prepared for shooting, there were many rumors outside. Some said that Greta Garbo was not very satisfied with playing the role of the dancer. Wallace Beery was unwilling to play the role of the busy giant, and some said that this film would only be used to pad the floor in the future, (that is, thrown on the floor).</p>
<p>But when the film started shooting, the atmosphere became tense again. Every major actor was preparing to show off their skills in the most important parts and the most important scenes.</p>
<p>Goulding was not only able to direct, but also able to use diplomatic skills to make these five equally important people feel that he had no favoritism or partiality. This made them feel that he had no favoritism or partiality. If the film needed to show someone's head or someone's legs, then it must be done, regardless of the star's opinion.</p>
<p>Although these stars were all very famous, they did not all know each other when the film began shooting. Only Garbo and Lionel Barrymore had co-starred in "Camille" once.</p>
<p>ⅩⅩⅩⅩ</p>
<p>Garbo and John Barrymore seemed very happy to co-star. John also found it interesting to co-star with her. She had long praised John's talent for acting, so their acquaintance added to the interest.</p>
<p>Many workers on the film set also said that she had never worked so diligently.</p>
<p>[As far as I know, this is the first time,] one of them said. [She had never participated in rehearsals before starting to shoot "Grand Hotel." But she was able to remember her role very accurately, which is commendable.]</p>
<p>The reason why [Grand Hotel] was able to be shot so peacefully and without dispute from beginning to end was largely due to the director, Mr. Goulding, because he knew and was able to use the personality of each of the stars. Even when it came to one thing, he was the only one who dared to call Garbo [Greta] during the shooting process, and some said that he had called her [Dear] very comfortably and warmly.</p>
<p>Because in reality, most people formally call Garbo [Miss Garbo,] only Garbo knows whether she liked Goulding giving her such an affectionate title, but in any case, she did not raise any objections to this point. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of the Bloody Battle History of the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>While the Northeast Volunteer Army was fighting barefoot in the freezing snow in single clothes, and the people in the rear in Guannei were warming themselves around the stove, this sad and heroic film was able to be released in front of us. I think it should be very stimulating for us [quasi-slaves of the country], right? Especially in the current Shanghai film atmosphere of sensuality and love, this film does have new significance.</p>
<p>This is a [documentary film]. It does not have the structure of a story, nor does it have the insertion of [love], which is generally indispensable. So it may not be very suitable for the tastes of those young masters. It is completely a battlefield reality, systematically showing the hideous face of imperialism and the arduous struggle of the Volunteer Army in front of us. Although there are still many unsatisfactory aspects in the editing method, the [contrast] between the two armies is very powerful. Although there are few direct hand-to-hand combat scenes, we should admire the courageous spirit of the people of the Nine Star Company because of the adventure and difficulty of battlefield photography. However, it cannot be considered a major shortcoming that it overly emphasizes national heroes and does not pay attention to the strength of the people of Northeast China. Secondly, there is an inevitable intentional exaggeration of the Volunteer Army, which seems to have the fault of arrogance and underestimation of the enemy. Furthermore, the enemy's brutality cannot be described more, which may be because the facts are not permitted. The shots are inevitably clumsy. The light is clear. The subtitles increase the educational power.</p>
<h3>Famous Soviet Director to Produce Sound Slapstick Film</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Eisenstein, a famous Soviet film director, is now starting to produce an important sound slapstick film. At the same time, Eisenstein is starting to work on a film called [Black Consul] based on the French Revolution.</p>
<p>There are not many. But at present, we can have such a new and unique film. Why should we be too demanding on the technique?</p>
<p>In short, this is a good film, if it can be more accurate in meaning. In the middle of this, we can see the enemy army recklessly slaughtering with sharp weapons. We can see the spirit of the Volunteer Army fighting for the nation. We can see the situation of running out of ammunition and being cut off from reinforcements, thereby awakening our responsibility to the Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that every cinema in Shanghai will be able to specially show this film at the lowest ticket price, which should be the case in awakening the masses and expanding the task of the national war. At the same time, when showing this film, it is essential to avoid mixing it with all other meaningless short films, so as not to confuse the audience's mood, and add powerful, tragic music or other short films with the same meaning before showing it to increase the power of the film.</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>[Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance] in Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Sheng Hong</p>
<p>The new film being shown in Nanjing today, [Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance], Congress Danes, is produced by the German Ufa Film Company and is also a masterpiece of Lilian Harvey.</p>
<p>The play is based on the romantic life of Russian Emperor Alexander I in Vienna in 1814 with a certain woman.</p>
<p>Lilian Harvey is a famous European star who plays a peerless beauty in [Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance] and seduces the Russian emperor with her beauty. Henry Garat plays a suave emperor who steals fragrance and jade. Lilian Harvey and Henry Garat were originally actors of the American Fox Film Company and had a contract. This time, the German Ufa Film Company borrowed them from Fox after several consultations because the two main characters in [Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance] could only be Lilian Harvey and Henry Garat. Therefore, today's film in Nanjing can be presented to our eyes.</p>
<p>As for the supporting roles, in addition to Henry Garat, there are also Lil Dagover, Conrad Veidt, etc.</p>
<p>[Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance] has moving music, soul-stirring dances, clear dialogue, and magnificent palaces. As for all the scenery, it was also filmed in Old Vienna.</p>
<p>Statement of Opinion</p>
<h3>On Animal Films</h3>
<p>— Yu Lun</p>
<p>A message translated from a mainland newspaper that was published in this publication on the 15th stated that last year, the most favored films by local moviegoers were: 1) "Eternal Love" [literal translation of 同心结, could also be "Knot of Hearts"], 2) "Tarzan the Ape Man," 3) "The Dream of the Red Chamber's Romantic History," 4) "Frankenstein," and 5) "Dragon-Tiger Fight". Based on these results, it can be said that people in this locale have recently become fond of watching animal films.</p>
<p>Children are naturally fond of watching films about life in the natural world, and recently, adults have also shown this trend. The reason is that people are curious, but I believe there are two other reasons.</p>
<p>The difference between humans and beasts is that one wears clothes and the other does not. However, there are many beasts in human clothing in society who spend their days engaging in deception and betrayal, always wearing masks when they meet. In this case, it is better to be as straightforward as animals. The life of beasts in human clothing is too depressing, and people really envy the straightforward life, so they like to watch animal films.</p>
<p>Another reason is that when two beasts meet in animal films, they each do their best to fight. Even if a cow encounters a tiger, it will fight to the end without surrendering. And humans in the wilderness also survive through struggle. We Chinese are deeply troubled by the daily foreign insults, while some generals in the country are still not resisting. This is too infuriating, so people watch animal resistance to console themselves in their boredom.</p>
<p>I highly sympathize with Mr. Yu Lun's views. Editor's humble note appended.</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Japanese Starlet</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>This is Hollywood's rising Japanese starlet, named Tosh Mori. This publication has introduced her before, and now we are publishing her small photo again. In General Yan's "Bitter Tea" [literal translation of 苦茶, assumed film title] she plays General Yan's concubine, who communicates with the enemy, leading to General Yan's disastrous defeat. Doesn't she look like an Oriental vamp?</p>
<h3>The Story of the "Match King" (13)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>Just as everything was settled and he was about to go to Murna, Murna's telegram arrived:</p>
<p>To Paul Kreuger, Stockholm, Sweden: I have signed a contract with an American film company. Departing from Bremen on Saturday for Hollywood. This is my life's opportunity. Please forgive me. Love, Murna.</p>
<p>Paul stared blankly at the telegram, his face filled with disappointment. He wondered if he would have time to rush to Bremen to say goodbye to Murna.</p>
<p>Impossible. The board of directors called an emergency meeting to discuss a major matter: a large loan was due and could not be renewed. Paul had to find a way to raise funds, but at that time the New York Stock Exchange was suspending trading, and the situation was very critical. Paul called Eric in.</p>
<p>"What can you do this time?" Eric said, looking obviously helpless.</p>
<p>"Can you quickly check the general situation of our company and report it to me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I instructed the head of the accounting department to quickly prepare a simple report this morning." He ran to the safe, opened it, took out a piece of paper, and read: "Forty countries owe you money; the total amount of assets you control in the match industry alone is about 1.2 billion gold dollars, not including other businesses; you produce a total of 30 trillion boxes of matches each year; you have 250 match factories in forty-three countries in Europe, South America, North America, and Asia; but..." Eric's voice strangely lowered, "Now that the world's economies are experiencing panic, there is no place to mortgage this report for a single penny!"</p>
<p>"After Eric finished speaking, Paul collapsed in his chair, subconsciously biting his large thumb."</p>
<p>"Hasn't it been difficult enough for us since Holmestead?"</p>
<p>Paul said, still subconsciously trying to find a way to escape, but after searching for a long time, there was no crack in the floor to crawl into. "Okay, Eric, don't panic. Wait a moment, I will naturally think of a way."</p>
<p>After Eric left, Paul's nerves were extremely stimulated, so tense that they were almost about to explode. He pulled Murna's photo out of the drawer, but his eyes were blurred, and all he saw was a white expanse. His lips trembled. He suddenly cried out, stuffed Murna's photo back into the drawer, stood up, and ran to a secret safe. He opened the safe, took out a small black notebook, and scribbled in it hastily. Suddenly he turned to a page that read: (To be continued) Correct.</p>
