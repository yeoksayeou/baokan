<h3>時評　如何使個人感情趨於合理化都</h3>
<p>閩變猝發。舉國震驚。外侮方殷。内戰又起。譬之百病叢脞之身。復遭遇意外之屯厄。又如驚濤駭浪之中。忽惹起同舟之爭執。其爲危狀。寗待深論。閩方無論藉口如何堂皇。揭業如何磊落。要無以自解於國人。蓋在今日累卵情勢之下。凡屬軍人。惟有一致團結。共扞邦患。縱宿嫌之未釋。應容忍於一時。奈何激於小忿。自亂步驟。遽欲令抗敵有功之將士。充同根相煎之前驅乎。陳李等平日非無頭腦。寗獨不明是理。顧必欲冒此不韙者。有以見其受蔽於感情者深也。</p>
<p>間嘗掄之。我國人士。每好侈談情性。矜持意氣。以小我爲前提。置大體於不顧結果乃造成褊狹自私之心理。黨同伐異。賢者不免。指鹿爲馬。小人慣技。馴至利害失其均衡。是非漫無標凖。此種現象。不特爲今人共稔之通病。抑且有歷史傳統的觀念。作姦犯科。睚眦必報。太史公用以傳游俠。侵官生事。征利拒諫。司馬光以之詆荆公。若太史公若司馬光。固號稱賢達之士。逞肊而談。猶不能無顚倒於黑白。則感情蒙蔽之爲患也。輓近人心。益趨澆偷。但思發揮個性。罔顧恊於事理。對於一切社會現象。以因循爲便。以改革爲難對於一切人才進退。以情面爲重。以需要爲輕。對於一切事業設計。以私利爲亟。以公益爲緩。一言不合。動思破壞。一事不預。即爾中傷。至有不擇手段。不計利害。不顧大局不惜清議。而悍然唯欲縱一已感情之私者。觀乎累次内戰之發動。多由意氣所激成。非其顯著之例證乎。</p>
<p>或情起於感覺之反應。剌激稍深。易趨盪决。欲求適當之控制。應以理智爲調節。吾人平日惑於感情。莫知反省。坐令進化阻滯。國事敗壞。糾正之道。謂宜人人裁抑感情。捐除意氣。抛執著之成見。以法理爲依歸。勿復以小惠損在體。以小忿傷大計。情理之辨識旣清。利害之判析自明。内而導揚攘私崇公之正義。外而消除喪邦害本之戾氣。轉捩之機。庶其在是。敢藉閩事。一申斯義。願天下有心人念之重念之。</p>

<h3>希特勒評論歐洲政局　薩爾問題解决法德卽可相安　對平等權利有分期達到餘地　不欲復返國聯願與各國談判</h3>
<p>（巴黎）今日德總理希特勒延見巴黎消息報政治主筆白林農氏、詳論歐洲國際政學、白氏事後將希氏之談話、載諸消息報及巴黎晨報、希氏曾謂、德法間並無甚大之爭執、可以引起兩國間之戰爭、並謂將來薩爾問題解决之後、兩國間即可相安無事云、白林農繼提亞爾薩斯羅蘭問題、希氏當即鄭重聲明、德國已確實放棄對於亞爾薩斯羅蘭地帶之主權、此後德國無復併吞隣國土地之野心云、希氏繼論及德波間情狀、希氏極讚揚波蘭人民之愛國心、惟謂德國亦有其保持原有習慣之理由、德波兩國間之爭執、胥由於巴黎和約處理之不善、有以肇成之、但亦無足致流血之重大爭端、且兩國間現已有接近之端倪、預料不久即將有友好條約訂立云、希氏復竭力宣揚其和平之志願、謂歐洲各國、倘自相戰爭、則布爾希維克將乘各國之相爭而取得漁翁之利、將來歐洲或將爲亞洲强國所控制、亦未可知、蓋亞洲戰雲方亟、尚不知孰勝孰負也、故今日歐洲列强、應亟行更新其政策、着眼於遠大之目的、而彼個人之所以必欲恢復德國之光榮者、實係對於數千萬人良心上之主張、並無對外之野心、且德國爲與貧困奮鬥、尤無籌備戰爭之餘暇云、白林農氏繼問希氏、德法兩國問究竟有無携手之可能、希氏稱此事須視法國之意志如何爲定如法國堅持其保障之安全在乎德國之荏弱者則兩國間間實無接近之可能、蓋此種思想之時期、今日已不懷存在也、如法國能承認和解之可能、並願開始與德國談判者、則彼願靜聆一切、考慮一切、担負一切、蓋德國所要求之平等利益、究爲何物、至易解釋、以道德而言、則爲平等之主權、但以實際而言、儘有分期達到目的之餘地、但如給與德國平等地位、須先由德國給與讓與之代價者、則彼願聞法國究須何物作爲平等利權之代價、及法國所謂保障者究係何物云、希氏末謂、德國不欲返日内瓦、因國聯已成一國際巴力門各國處於其中、互相傾軋、不特不足以銷釋誤會、且反足增重之也、惟德國殊願與其他任何政府開談判云、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<h3>力謀增進對華貿易　羅斯福貨幣政策批評愈烈　工商業統制計劃更將嚴緊　史潑萊辭職引起各方注意</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據此間表示、美政府及國會將來如採用任何白銀計劃、仍將以對華貿易爲主要動機、此間白銀專家、刻正縝密研究銀價之提高、是否有利於對華輸出、國會内外之銀派領袖皆稱、苟中國之貨幣能與美國貨幣價值愈益接近、則中國之購買力此大見增加、中國之輸入將受大剌激、而美國之工商業亦可大蒙其益、但一般反對提高銀價者則稱、白銀之賞際用途、僅爲解决貿易差額之一法、其價格之漲落、對於貿易之動向不致有大影響、現爲决定兩派見解之正誤起見、一般貿易與白銀專家正就各要素加以研究、據此時適經作成之一種統計、自本年元旦以來、白銀對美元匯價已增百分之五十、而美國對華輸出亦有增加、但其比率未能相等云、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）今晚法外長彭古與其他各代表團首領分頭歸國、軍縮會議主席漢德森居住日内瓦之期、亦不出十餘日、但各專門股員會則繼續工作、各國對此項工作之參加、其程度之深淺雖將不齊、然至少軍縮會議技術工作繼續不停之原則、究得維持、固法國代表所堅决主張者也、此外彭古尚得到其他結果、（一）英國有意放棄十月十四日决定之討論基礎、經彭古斡旋之後、英國已無此意、（二）外傳將於日内瓦之外召集一種和平會議、此說亦經彭古之反對、歸於消滅、（三）彭古又曾與英國·捷克·蘇俄·波蘭·奥國代表進行談話、其内容在爲時局前途作一凖備、而不限於軍縮問題、波蘭代表勒泰斯基亦曾與蘇俄代表駐法大使陶佛伽萊斯基會晤、雙方以爲俄波兩國對歐洲政局上嚴重問題、彼此意見完全一致云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>温泉頃悉美總統對於財部貨幣總顧問史撥拉格之辭職函、並無煩惱之感、緣此事久在意中、據稱、史氏自出席經濟會議而歸、即投間置散、不復爲總統所信任、至美總統對於其貨幣政策在代理外長毛根韜與金融善後公司總董瓊斯指導下之進步、顯似完全滿意、所以渠表示現正轉而注意於全國、復興行政處復興督辦强森將於星期五來此、與總統討論全部復興計畫、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日美財長伍定發表一談片、切責財部貨幣總顧問史潑拉格昨日辭職函中語、對於史氏所稱、美國必須以不穩妥擔保、向民間舉債二十萬萬元一節、攻擊尤力、謂史氏指美政府公債爲不穩妥擔保、將自損其常識與資格、史氏曾任英倫銀行總顧問、爲國際著聞之貨幣專家、乃容個人之意氣、迷惑其判斷力、激動其性情云云、論者以爲此語足見史氏不僅與羅斯福政策不合、即與財部内較穩健一派意見亦不甚相投、至向來擁護政府貨幣政策者、見伍定之談片、莫不色喜、因伍氏公認爲財部穩健派之領袖、今有此聲明、足見其至少有一部份同情於白宫政策、因此預料美政府在穩健金融派内之威信、亦將爲之增加不少云、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（紐約）垣街所抱史潑萊敎授辭職未必在政府黃金政策上發生影響之見辭、確有根據、聞羅總統現已與代理財長摩甘索切實進行其計畫矣、主要證劵今日起落無定、範圍頗狹、而政府公債則甚疲弱、美元在外匯市塲上暫未狂跌、一般交易甚形沉寂、經紀人以爲政府已設法穩定市面、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國財部顧問史潑萊敎授之辭職、已引起此問人士之大注意、蓋历史敎授前與英倫銀行有關、且爲穩健貨幣派之代表也、一　般與情以爲羅斯福總統將行貨幣政策、完全不顧其在世界他處之影響、其最後結果、將使用金國被迫放棄金本位、而入於用金鎊國如英國者之列耳、用金國旣放棄金本位後、或可有召集新貨幣大會之途徑、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>費城前出席倫敦世界經濟會議之美代表團經濟顧問華堡、向以羅總統親信顧問見稱、今日對衆發言、痛詆羅總統貨幣政策、華堡指斥統制的通貨膨脹之說、謂通貨膨脹絶不能統制、一旦膨脹、勢必逾出統制範圍、且亦絶不能有如所謂有恒久不變購買力的貨幣之事、今一般濳伏無聲的多數人民、宜向羅總統告以美國人民凖備在逐漸而有次序的復興進程中應付一切云、聽衆皆係美國政治與社會學界中人、聞華堡抨擊羅總統政策之言、咸覺出乎意外、華堡又言及羅總統致世界經濟大會之文、謂渠之責任、在審愼研究後解釋其義、渠卒决定此事非渠所能辦理、故函致國務卿赫爾辭退金融顧問職、但渠仍暗中行動、冀能使羅總統覺悟繼續其貨幣嘗誠政策之錯誤、羅總統之爲人、甚可欽佩、但一種錯誤觀念、似迷惑其旨趣、且顧問過多、全不顧及千百年來累積之經騐、人類智力、如尚未能管理簡單的金本位、則更未能處理統制的商品、及美元之更複雜問題矣、國家幣制、苟不爲多數其他重要國家所採用、則决不能運用圓滿、出席世界經濟大會之多數國家、顯願成立合乎近代之改良的金本位、華堡末稱、必有利益之營業絶多收入豐、而物價方可提高、若僅僅提高物價、未見其可也云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>芝加哥史潑拉格發出辭職函後、在各方責難聲中、已獲一知已、其人即爲美國中西部金融界奉爲泰斗之芝加哥經濟學家亞倫、今日亞倫發表談話、稱史氏請國人注意政府膨脹通貨政策之根本謬誤、可謂對於公衆之偉大服務、國人須知減輕金元、恰爲削弱、而非加强物價結構云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）據今日國會工業會議管理局所發表之統計、美國之公債、三年來已增加六·三六○·○○○·○○○元、其總數已達二二·五○○·○○○·○○○元、其增加之原因、在稅收减少、意外之費用增加云、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>英法商戰　影響友好關係　英要求法撤銷附稅無效</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英法間貿易戰爭恐將擾動兩國間之友好關係、英國要求法國撤銷對英國貨物所施之百分十五附稅與百分六落地稅、否則英國對於法貨將徵收百分二十之進口稅以示報復、上述辦法、今日已由英商相任錫曼通知駐英法大使矣、前任法財長佛蘭亭現以法國衆議院代表團領袖之資格來遊英倫、聞昨夜曾往見英外相西門討論此事、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）商相任錫曼今日下午在下院宣稱、法國如不早日取銷對英貨所徵之附稅、則英政府將對法貨收額外稅云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國以友誼的談判請法國徹銷附稅與落地稅、卒無效果、乃有報復之恫嚇、按法國阻稅並不施諸美貨、故未免歧視英國、再英國貿易尚有受法國稅則打擊之處、英國新威爾斯煤業本星期得法國將進口外煤限額由百分之六五減至百分五五之消息、於是該地一處將減至六十萬噸、而使礦工四千人爲之失業、法財長龐萊近曾依允取銷附稅、但法國商界尤其是棉織界壓力甚力、故其言卒未履行、英國之哀的美敦書將使法總理薩勞更難應付今日衆院關於預算案之質問、衆料薩勞内閣遲早間將蹈達拉第内閣之覆轍、許多方面以爲唯狄克推多可以解决之、但不幸具有狄克推多之資格者、現似無其人、法國自九月一日黃金流出、現達英幣三千萬鎊、足徵預算不平衡時人心之浮動、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<h3>閩政變後　影響剿匪前途　匪乘勢在黨口一帶反攻</h3>
<p>南昌通信、陳銘樞等此次異動、當醖釀時期、中央已微有所聞、初擬分别疏通解釋、委曲求全、以彌裂痕、日前汪院長應蔣委員長電約與葉楚傖乘飛機來贛、無非商確此事、時汪蔣仍决取鎭靜態度、以爲應付、冀其以國難爲重、乃事實適得其反、及陳等旣到福州、蔣仍以剿赤進展、軍事吃緊、萬不宜再有内爭、乃於十五日派飛機兩架赴福州、迎接蔡廷鍇來贛、俾曉以大義、從中勸阻、詎靜候至今、此機迄未飛返、及至二十日、始知兩機已被扣留、而叛變事態、亦不幸證實、據此間公布閩變眞相、陳銘樞初組社會民主黨、以十九路軍爲基本武力、近復拉攏第三黨以張其燄、而第三黨首領黃琪翔、又爲之聯絡共黨、與贛閩之匪軍、互相默契、故二十日之福州市民大會、遂標榜土地革命、而黃琪翔彭澤湘等又已與匪軍成立恊定、羅炳輝彭德懷之妻、均尚滯留福州、此最足令人注意也、</p>
<p>閩省政變姑無論其與匪默契與否然與剿匪前途、實發生絶大影響、蓋匪之重心、在贛粤閩三省毘連地段、三省合力圍勦、缺一不足以收效、况僞一方面主力、結集贛東閩西之南豐·南城·黎川·資溪·與建寗·寗化·光澤·邵武·崇安·交界山地、尤非贛閩駐軍、東西夾攻、不足制其死命、日前朱毛傾全力攻贛東、如許灣大雄關等役、國軍將各匪擊破、乃自二十日閩局變化之消息傳出後、赤匪以有機可乘、在南豐宜黃之黨口一帶、向北反攻、極爲激烈、但蔣委員長對此極爲鎭靜、仍照原定計劃進勦、刻北路軍在贛東者、不下三十萬人、且均精銳之師、足以對付朱毛也、（二十二日）</p>

<h3>側重旁觀待其自變</h3>
<p>昨日、記者晤京來對於熟悉閩變之某君、據談、閩變勃發、另組政府、其參與份子之複雜、爲普通人士所深悉、惟閩方之對於粤省、若欲藉十九路軍全部六師之兵力、侵入粤省、恐事非易易、至於閩之聯共、雖軍事不無關係但欲眞正雙方諒解、一無疑忌、恐亦未至時期、况十九路軍以前、屢與紅軍鏖戰、縱能相安一時、亦决不能持久、如此、則閩方唯有先整理地方、鞏固地位、然後再向中央挑釁、中央對閩之陳李、以屬罪首、欲積極以武力剷滅、但事態未必擴大、蓋中央洞悉閩事底藴深知實行軍事、操之過急、閩軍難保不完全赤化、彼時反爲共黨造機會、所以中央現將側重旁觀聽其自變、蓋閩粤與閩共之間、尚多問題、俟閩内部自起變化、予因勢利導、可免西南一角多受糜爛、至於防務則自屬必要、故現在不但浙贛之防禦增厚、即海軍對於閩東沿海各口、亦須加以監視也云云、</p>

<h3>李世甲昨到滬晤陳</h3>
<p>海軍部常務次長李世甲、昨晨由京到滬、即至高昌廟第一艦隊部晤司令陳季良、商洽閩事、當發致京厦電報數件、直至午刻十二時十五分、方偕陳季良同乘汽車外出午餐、記者晤李於該司令部前、李見記者、即以手掩口、頻曰、「對閩事我不欲談」、「對閩事我没有消息」、嗣記者以中央處置辦法、固有關於軍事、未便公布、但已成之事實、要求李氏答復、李答、「馬江方面、已被接收、厦門尚安謐如常、李孟斌司令、乘海寗艦、何時過淞、未知其詳、厦門航空處是否有遷移必要、尚難即下斷語、惟海部方面、目下尚無此意思、所有被閩截去之兩艦、均係測測量船、無關重要、」繼詢此來任務、李曰、「余每星期必來滬一次、辦理例行公務、」其時陳季良在旁、於是記者叩李、「外傳海部有派陳率艦赴閩之說確否、」李僅稱、「不知其詳、」而陳氏則在旁筦爾曰、「不確、」「不去、」談畢而别、嗣聞被閩截獲之海鵠·景星·兩測量艦、其艦長曾偉·葉水源·已避走、在海軍方面、尚未能證實、</p>

<h3>體育上海女籃球會錦標决賽　兩江勝東南保持冠軍　２２－３５雙方表演均佳爭門劇烈　東南以經騐不足而失敗　丨今晚仍有三塲比賽丨</h3>
<p>兩江女籃球隊、昨晚以三十五比二十二戰勝東南、保持上海女子籃球錦標、中華籃球房觀衆十分擁擠、爲本季女籃球賽第一次盛况、兩隊表演均佳、兩江陳榮明、尤爲出色、東南因前鋒劉文華之過份鎭靜、與任祝二女士不能合拍、實爲吃虧不少、全隊陳容、時露慌張、動作亦較慢、此實由於經騐不足之故、兩江隊歷史攸久、飽經滄桑、經騐富足、進退有序、絲毫不紊、昨晚尚有一塲乙組比賽、强東以八十比一分、大勝上中、</p>
<h3>第一節爭鬥激烈</h3>
<p>第一塲强東與上中之賽方畢、甲組决賽東南對兩江繼續登塲、兩隊同學、各以掌聲迎接、劇戰旣起、東南一鼓作氣、猛撲兩江防線、任淑劉文華先後失機、觀者爲之惋惜、旋見廖祝元首開紀錄、喊聲暴發、震耳欲聾、兩江極力戒備、鼓勇報復、楊森籃下投中、意想不到、東南任淑、罰球不中、劉文華接得發射、又加二分、兩江不甘雌伏、還以顔色、陳榮明造成平手、楊森遠射命中、比數驟然超出、廖祝元加上一分、陳楊又得四分、兩江以十比五居先、東南呌息、仍無起色、潘夢再中、劉文華還敬、第一節兩江十二比七佔優、</p>
<h3>第二節東南不支</h3>
<p>第二節之形勢、東南頗示紊亂、前鋒傳遞失效、不能破兩江防線、於是兩江進攻機會較多、屢有建樹、楊森首先罰中、東南廖祝元加上三分、此後東南困於嚴守、難於進取、兩江活動更勤、楊森一中再中、形勢似傾向一面、是節兩江九分、東南三分、總計二十一比十一、相差十分、此爲上半時之情形、</p>
<h3>第三節相持不下</h3>
<p>東南急起追趕、力圖復報兩江乘勝餘威、鋒芒仍盛、雙方競爭、愈見激烈、你爭我奪、互不示弱、陳榮明兇猛如男子、罰一中一、又加三分、任淑還報一球以後、陳又得三分、東南落後有十四分之多、然毫不氣餒、劉文華亦中一球、陳榮明再加二分後、廖祝元連得四分、總計互得八分、東南仍落十分、成十九比二十九、</p>
<h3>第四節仍無變化</h3>
<p>最後一節、東南大有破釜沉舟、背城借一之勢、無如陣容益形紊亂、力不從心、徒喚奈何、任淑首中以後、兩江陳榮明連中二只潘夢加上兩分、東南愈覺不支勝負之局面早定、東南於再接再厲中、由廖祝元罰中一分、總結果成三十五比二十二、歸兩江勝利、保持錦標、裁判陸翔千周家騏、</p>

<p>比賽開始復旦隊兩次衝人籃下、投籃俱求中的、糾纒移時、復旦趙不忝犯規、青光由董小培罰進一分、旋復旦數次猛衝、由趙不忝周達雲各獲一球、成四比一、青光由陣華輅罰一分、談達驊獲一球後、而復旦趙不忝張錦祥又連告中的、成八比三、後青光拼命追趕、由談達驊陳華輅先後建功、打成十二比十二平手、又曾超過二分、奈復旦畢竟年少氣壯、周趙二將、帶球衝鋒、所向無敵、結果遂以二十六比二十、結束上半時、</p>
<p>下半時起復旦隊調動人馬、前鋒更形活　、三分鐘内、復旦五虎、已相繼獲十二分、而青光仍一無建樹、苦鬥多時、始由董小培獲一球、後復旦氣勢益盛、你一我一、獲分纍纍、而青光隊則則攻已不能、守亦無法、困獸猶門、力不從心總結果以五十八比二十七、大敗於復旦、雙方陣綫如左、</p>

<h3>專件中國　近代敎育思想概觀（六）　舒　新城講述孫青才筆記　（四）政治革命時期丨（民國十二三年丨民國十七年）</h3>
<p>新敎育盛倡了好多年、實際上並不見得是多大的有裨國家社會、於是大家就一齊想在政治上去找出路、民國十三四年時候、國内黨派紛歧、互相鬥爭、有學校裏的一般學生們、也都競着加入黨派、你衝我奪、各自宣傳、社會思想、由此大變、到處充溢着政治革命意味、現在我把牠分做三方面來講、</p>
<p>國家主義敎育思想國家主義敎育思想、是從政治上的國家主義的思潮産生的、政治上的國家主義、發軔於斯巴達、復興於十八世紀、盛倡於十九世紀、近世政治上的倡國家主義者、前有德意志、後有土耳其意大利各國、倡這種主義的各項說素、雖然是很複雜、也却有一種共通的背景、這背景就是外侮底壓迫、中國政治上的國家主義思想、是直到民國十一年後才大倡的、民國十一年、國家主義思想旣大倡、於是國家主義敎育思想、便亦隨之而大倡、牠亦無非是以内憂外患當背景、以自立自强做目的、當時國家主義的敎育復興、倡議的人、都比較上有些深切的研究、理論亦比較完備、雖然因爲敎育思想和政治主張混在一起、受實際政治力底支配、不能得充分的發展、但在消極方面、却有兩種很顯著的事實、足以表現牠在實際敎育上的影響、這兩種事實、就是收回敎育權和軍事訓練、不過國家主義敎育思想、除了上面的兩種影響之外、何以不能再發生更種大的影響呢、這大概因爲下面的幾種原因、第一、中國人在歷史上是富於大同思想的、第二、敎會敎育的反映、第三、爲學敎育的失策、第四、敎育主義與政治主張混爲一起、</p>
<p>公民敎育思想公民敎育思想的所以産生、是由於中國的政治紊亂、和世界的民治主義混合激盪而使然、歡戰終了、各國民治主義大倡、流波遠到中國、那時適有美國敎育哲學家杜威於歐戰終了（民國九年）來中國講演、又極力鼓吹敎育的民治主義、留美之習敎育者、又根據美國的情形、而回到國内極力提倡、公民敎育思想、於是一日千里地發展、起先中小學校的修身科、一律改公避科、及到民國十五年、更加以上海基督敎青年會和江蘇敎育會底提倡、新敎育評論的鼓吹、而普及全國敎育界、推廣到學校以外了、公民敎育究是如何得釋呢、學者傳說紛紜、不一、李璜氏說、公民敎育應當是、（一）歷史敎育的發揮、（二）連帶負責的說明、（三）國家觀念的養成、程湘帆氏說、「歐美學者對於公民敎育的意義、大概有兩種主張、一、是狹義的、以公民在政治上不可少的知識、習慣、技能、欣賞、觀念、思想、精神、做標準、一是廣義的、除造就政治上的資格外、並及社會、家庭、人類、職業、與個人修身之類、公民敎育思想的變遷、可分四個時期、綿延到最後、並由學校公民敎育進而及於社會公民敎育、在實際上也曾有過廣大的運動、直到十六年以後、才完全消沉下去、公民敎育底含義、雖因時代和學者底見解而不完全一致、但大概都是以養成奉公守法愛國愛人的民德爲目的的、可是民德並不因此有所提高、這有三種重大的原因、第一因爲是人民生計困難、不惜犧牲、第二是被中國歷史上不重公民道德的傳統思想所阻止、第三是政治的惡影響、所以雖然公避敎育思想、發生幾十年、在學校裏縱或有相當的成績、到社會上也還終敵不住環境底陶鑄、而無多大實效、</p>
<p>黨化敎育思想黨化敎育、是中國國民黨在民國十三年、握中國政權後的一種名詞、醖釀到十六年四月、國民政府建都南京、國民黨一面在行動上分共、一面在理論上自求獨立、於是「黨化敎育」四字、就由國民政府治下的敎育行政委員會明白規定、韋慤是委員之一、他提出黨化敎育的名詞並確定意義如此、「黨化敎育是革命化和民衆化的敎育、而且是科學化和社會化的敎育、」王克仁氏說、「黨化敎育、積極的意義、是敎育要革命化、人格化、民衆化、社會化、科學、化不是這樣的敎育、就不能救國、不能救國的敎育、便不是中國國民黨主張的黨化敎育、」魯繼曾氏說、「黨化敎育、就是敎我們怎樣做人的敎育、……」其時黨化敎育四字、到處有人談論、及民國十七年、吳稚暉等一般人、因見於黨化敎育一名詞、含義太廣泛、丨共産黨也是黨、國民黨也是黨、未免弄不清、這所謂黨化究竟是共産黨還是國民黨、便主張改稱「三民主義敎育、」從此以後、便祇見三民主義敎育一名詞了、黨化敎育、雖然是因爲有國民黨而産生的、但在國民黨底經典中、並没有根據、不過因「世俗用語」而演成一種思潮、因爲牠是世俗用語、而非出於先知先覺者的系統提倡、所以内容不確定、民衆易誤解、民國十六年以後的三四年間、因爲政治勢力的驅策、渾沌的黨化敎育思想、竟發生許多惡果、這種現象、提倡黨化敎育的人、也深感到、</p>

<h3>命運論</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>「運去黃金减色，時來頑鐵生光。」</p>
<p>上面這這兩句古話、雖然純粹是感概性質，却也頗切事理，可說是感慨得恰到好處！因爲我們生長在這個世界裏，祗要是吃過了二三十年老米飯的，從他們所見到的種種事實上研求起來，便會發生如下的一層感覺。就是有才有德的人未必會有什麽發展，無才無德的人也未必個個餓死；而且兩者往往顚倒的排列着，越是才識高，思想新而又操守廉潔的人往往被壓住最低的一層裏，甚至不免一死，反之，越是一無所長，不循正軌的脚色，却偏能置身在青雲之上，享受不盡。這是什麽緣故呢？誰也不能解釋，最適當的自然祇有把他諉諸於命運問題了！</p>
<p>記得從前，曾聽人說過一段小小的故事，乃是乾隆皇帝下江南中的一節。「也許是康熙皇帝，但是，不管他，總是他們二位中的一位是了。」他說：某一日乾隆皇帝到南京城外一所大廟中去游玩，和尚知是當今天子駕到，少不得俯伏遠迎，殷勤接待，摔得乾隆非常適意，便命侍臣賞了他許多東西。恰巧其時有個落第的窮秀才借宿在這個廟裏，聽見了乾隆這番舉動，不覺喟然長嘆道：「怪不得時世要變了，連皇帝也歡喜奉承起來，却便宜了這些光頭們，不費什麽力，便得了這麽一大票。像我十載寒窗，苦苦用功，連個小小的前程也還巴不到咧！」正在這個時候，乾隆走過他的屋子，就一字不漏的聽見了。馬上喚他出來，一看他的窗課，居然很有幾分實學；無奈方才已聽他在背後指摘自已，心上不免有些不快，便說了下面這幾句話，他說：「才是你好，運是他好；（他指和尚）不然何以他見了我，就會有好處，你見了我偏不能合我的意呢？」</p>
<p>當初，我心上很覺得當皇帝的人眞蠻横，旣然看他的文藝不錯，就該奬拔奬拔他、爲什麽反說了這樣一套要人命的冷話呢。但是如今想想，乾隆階下的話眞不錯，旣富哲理，又極幽默，實在值得佩服。其中最精警的兩句話「才是你好，運是他好。」更足以震聵發聾，醒一醒今日一般但知怨天尤地，不知怪怪自已命運的寒士們的迷夢。因復爲演述，作命運論。</p>
<h3>病菊</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>秋天到了，那園丁要忙着把菊花擔到市上來換錢了。充滿詩意的中國人，都懂得持螯對菊是風雅的事，儘是自頂至踵無一雅體，自朝至暮無一雅事，但是在這持螯對菊的片晌，至少是有一點雅氣了。不過持螯而不對菊，還不夠稱雅，倘然對菊而不持螯。倒不失雅人深致。這一點，給菊占了便宜去。孔二先生說，「食色性也。」二者並舉，無所偏頗，可是食輸色一籌，食是俗的，色是雅的，只飽眼福，不至餓死，因爲秀色可餐啊。</p>
<p>這們的傳統下來，到現在，對菊的人，踵事增華，他們不以籬角幾株，膽瓶一簇爲滿足，還要在種子上講究，因此那個雅字，便提高了標凖，非懂得施黃，柳線，梨香等等名詞和鑒别，還不夠稱雅，對着幾個泥盆裏五顔六色的「蘿葡絲」的賞鑑家，要退而爲俗人了。</p>
<p>還有幾個自負有能耐的園丁，要賣弄他的藝術，把菊花培植得奇形怪狀，幾乎使人見了疑心他不是菊花了。有的一盆裏生着論百朶的花，用鉛絲紥得「簇嶄施齊。」有的一根幹子上開着兩種的花。有的成了錦屏。有的成了寶塔。矯揉造作，隨心所欲，陳列在廳事上、自然矞皇典麗，和「唐苑」一般。但是這種菊花，和龔定厂所見江浙之間的病梅一般，也得稱他爲病菊了。</p>
<p>在這裏，我倒又悟到一點小道理了，凡是美的藝術，都不能無病，眞正以天然爲美的美學論者，實在都是面子上的好看話。我還没有瞧見一個主張天然美者，到鄕間去和一個村娃戀愛，到了城市裏，還是讓伊亂頭粗服，而一點不使化妝。那麽惟其病，便是美之所在了，美的眞義是這樣的罷？</p>
<h3>江邊晚望</h3>
<p>— 金君珏</p>
<p>白門悵臥未能歸。日日沙頭望翠微。六代已隨芳草没。一春常與故人違。江喧午枕迴殘夢。天壓孤城剩落暉。辜負平生掣鯨毛。闌苕未羨錦鱗肥。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>黃曼英見他的意思有些活動了，又極力慫恿，於是他也就不再推諉，吃過了飯，和黃曼英一同搭長途汽車進城來。進了西直門，又坐上電車。這電車上，頗不少的鄕下人，有的携着大包裹小提籃，竟有些像長途旅行的神氣。黃曼英向桂枝笑道：這電車好像是火車，坐了不少出門的人。桂枝並没有坐過火車到那裏去，對於他這名話，根本無從答復，只是笑笑，没有說别的。他們對面長板凳上，坐了一個老頭子，就揷嘴笑道：可不是嗎？我們就把電車當火車坐了。以前京西到京南，繞了大半個城圈子，怪不近的。如今有了電車，由西北到正南，穿城而過，眞快的多。好像我是上大紅門去罷，下了電車，出永定門，不遠也就到了，若是全走起來，路可遠多了。桂枝忽然聽到大紅門三個字，好像耳朶裏曾留下過這樣一個地名，只是一時記不起來，這個地名與自已有什麽關係，却注意下來了。於是也就向那老人望了一眼，問道：大紅門？那地方很熱閙嗎？老人道：是永定門外，五六里地方，一個村莊，熱閙什麽？黃曼英道：我到南苑看跑馬去，走那裏經過的，那裏彷彿有兩家小茶館，什麽都没有，你怎麽倒知道那個地方。桂枝笑道：我也莫明其妙，彷彿耳朶裏面，記下了這樣一個地名。說着話時，電車上的人更多，聲音也分外的嘈雜，於是把這話說過，也就停止了。到了黃家，曼英的父母，少不得張羅一陣。他們知道自已姑娘心裏很難受，讓桂枝陪着說說笑笑也好，所以他一來之後，竟留着他接連過了三天。（二四八）</p>
<h3>車中素描片段</h3>
<p>— 陳碧君</p>
<p>人生的生活甜酸苦辣，本來跟着環境轉移，最快樂者，恐怕要算求學時代了。在上星期某一天，我因旅行出門，搭着京滬線第七號上行車，沿途景物，已入深秋狀態，車中旅客不多，很覺聒靜，車子到了某地，上來了一羣旅行團的女學生，有的着童子軍裝，有的穿了委地藍旗袍校服個個活潑潑地，精神煥發，爭奪座位，閙個不休，車中的空氣頓時也就緊張起來。領導的男先生，對着這班撒嬌撒痴的女同胞，曲意逢迎，活像大寺院裏勢利和尚對恃闊香客的一副嘴臉。不多一會，車開動了，伊們的談鋒也開始了。談話的焦點，不出取笑的範園，能言會道，富於滑稽性，伊們對於阿拉同鄕，則稱之爲寗波阿姊，遇着江北同志，就尊伊爲楊州妹妹，見到孤坐一隅默默不語的同學，就說伊正在懷想伊的夢裏情人，或說本校今天早上出發的當兒，伊的情人失約，未曾趕到送行，現在生氣了。直說到對方忍不住，反抗起來，住伊的嘴吧的時候，伊的全身會團在一起討饒，自已反對自已說：一哦！我說錯了，我的夢醒了。伊現在的不高興，大概是因昨夜失眠，失眠的原故，不是開夜車寫情書，就是翻箱倒籠尋找已失落的情書。」話剛說完，明知對方要來報復，馬上一溜烟竄入别的同學的堆裏，摟住别人的腰，連喊好姐姐救救我，滿車的人都爲伊閧堂大笑起來。其中有女生愛好音樂的，便吹起口琴來，有所唱歌和着伊，高的時候聲如裂帛，低的時候又好像泉鳴澗底，嬌嬌滴滴的音波，非但早把車中的沉寂打破，連車行的磷磷聲，也被壓下去了。有喜歡跳舞的，找着一些些空隙，按着琴韵歌聲的拍子，舞台舞，單人舞，　際舞，舞個不住。到了蘇州，伊們的精神格外興奮，個個探首窗外，猪油糕啊，粽子糖啊，西瓜子啊，麻酥餅啊，大買特買，狼吞虎咽地大嚼了一會，賣鮮花的老婦，提了一籃白蘭花兜售，也被搶一空，伊們掛在衣襟上頭，頓時濃香四散。</p>
<p>不多一會，我目的地到了，同伊們一羣快樂天使分别。唉！求學時代，好像迷醉在蜜一般甜的樂園裏，四周圍没有愁雲慘霧，没有紛爭，世界上一切罪惡，没有被伊們傳染，委實可愛，奈我童年消逝，韶華不再，觸景生情，令人起了無窮的感慨。</p>

<h3>歸航速寫（下）</h3>
<p>— 黃康屯</p>
<p>熱帶的葱葱未改，而青春知已老去。海風未靖，山雨欲來，我却藏到牛角尖禋來哼我的打油詩：</p>
<p>「熱風吹我還鄕去，脫却征衫着舊裳；椰子榴槤嘗徧後，柿紅橘綠蟹黃香。」</p>
<h3>香港山頭</h3>
<p>一個蓬頭垢面的鄕村姑娘，一一旦進了都市，施以粉黛，穿起時裝，居然變成摩登少艾。一座磽瘠不毛的荒山，經了八十餘年近代化的都市設施，居然成了東方要港。香港！本是天生成的大中華的南門！海水是綠得來比西方美人的眼珠兒還覺可愛；山頭是比處女酥胸的乳峯兒還要誘人。可是這個東方的絶世佳人，早就上了不列顚大漢子的勾引，做了從地中海向東來的馬耳他，哥侖坡，新加坡依次的第四個伴房。英倫帝國，眞是艶福不淺！老眼昏花的清廷，豈止斷送了一個「王昭君」。</p>
<p>道過香港，這是第四回。登香港山，却是第一回。趁了纜車上去。那纜車的坐椅是傾斜的，下來時，要背向前；却不及檳榔山的纜車製成平身坐位的舒適。車至一千三百零五呎高度而止。有七憎樓的山頂旅館。前面有兩座山頭：一座有總督行轅，駐兵房和無線電台，須步行或乘轎而上。一座有旅館，郵局，警察司及好幾所西式住宅，有汽車可通。從山頭俯瞰港市，九龍，與海面島嶼，宛然像一幅圖畫展開在案下。南望渺茫無際，島嶼星羅，宛似殘棋在局。各山頭道路的平廣堅潔，建築物的壯偉美奐，與平地上的都市建置無異。設計的工巧，魄力的雄厚，不能不令人佩服，可是實際在那裡胼手胝足，虻負峰攢地工作著的，那一個不是吾們的同胞。在那裡挑石子的，那一個不是我們廣東勞勲界的女將！</p>
<h3>廣九道中</h3>
<p>生長在長江流域或黃河流域的人，如果不曾出過東海，不會認識「海水的美。」同樣，他也許不會認識「南中國一的天時地理的美。不會深切的了解現代中華民族的覺醒何以由南迤北？這是我要順便到廣州去看看的内心的動機。</p>
<p>廣九鐵路全長一百十一英里。其中五分之一是英國築的，歸港政府管理；五分之四是廣東人爲民族爭氣而收歸自辦的。從九龍到深甽，英國建築的那一段，重山疊嶂，有隧道五。最長的凡七千二百五十英呎，沿途山環水抱，彷彿似湖。碧綠的稻田，白墻烏瓦的農家住屋，參差錯落在山隩水涘。風景入畫。深甽以北，平原漸廣。一片沃壞，彷彿在滬杭道中。低而平的稻畦，叢而茂的荔枝園，象徵出一片尚未没落的太平農村氣象。</p>
<h3>廣州一瞥</h3>
<p>火車在夜色朦朧中到了大沙頭，職的一聲摩托車把我送到東亞旅館。晚餐後，步行到落成未久的「海珠橋」。一路没有路燈，車馬行人，似乎大家在暗中摸索。橋是完全鋼骨水泥的歐式建築；可以在南中國誇耀爲獨一無二的。第二天，雇了一架人力車，一日之間，走遍了第一公園，黃花崗，執信學校，中山紀念堂，觀音山，中山大學各處。七十二烈士墓的壯偉建築，墓林的鬱茂，碑坊的森列，比較首都中山陵，似乎更能引人發思古之幽情，動愴然之深念。紀念堂在觀音山前，爲八面形之宫殿式，青藍屋瓦，白磁圓頂，象徵黨徽。山頂紀念塔可俯瞰廣州全市。稍下有胡漢民隸書孫先生讀書治事處等蓋舊物悉燬於民國十丨年陳炯明叛變時的砲擊之下。革命策源地的開國新氣象，可以在這幾項新建設中表露出來</p>

<h3>紐約股市依然呆滯</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告廿二日紐約股市、情勢平定、各股微有上落、羅斯福總統定於星期五夜演說、故投機家暫時都作觀望、市况乃形呆滯、美國公債受施潑賚敎授書影響、破落近乎一元、後因黃金官價不動、美元平定、回高半元、法國公債微升、比國公債略降、全日成交一百五十七萬股、又據鋼鐵世紀報告、鋼鐵生産量爲百分之廿七·五、衆信生産已屆鏟底之地步、蓋一九三四年初卽有暴增之可能也、目前定貨祇較前微增、但汽車業公共工程及鐵路工程將有需要、關於鐵路方面、聞有各大鐵路將英依賴政府而購買材料云、「小麥」人心動摇、市况略疲、暫時有麥差趨勢、「棉花」利於多方之原素殊見缺乏、卽以通貨膨　之可能性　言、在未有　定舉動　、市况已不能再先抬高、多方宜有結　、金　善後社收買黃金　兩價格爲三三·七六元、不動、</p>

<h3>糧食標粉後市補空轉穩</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開　後、各月份市面、呈初跌後穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小四五角、坎拿大小二三角、故開價時、市氣依然不振、近遠期較之前日收價、續跌二分左右、因實銷客帮之心　、亦轉停頓、天津現貨行情、以申粉　到之後、銷場平常、故報價亦復續跌、較前日計落八分、現售二元四角八分、不過業外人心、堅俏異常、逐盤均有買進、市面遂爲抬住、迨至下午開盤、天津山東等帮、仍有回出、惟市場之投機帮及一部廠家、連續補空與搶多、致近遠各期、均轉穩俏、觀察後步、當須暫時盤旋也、結果本月份較前日好七厘半、十二月份好一分二厘半、一月份好一分七厘半、二三月份好七厘半、四月份好一分、</p>
<h3>小麥疲而復俏</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面呈先跌後漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌四五角、坎拿大跌二三角、故開價時、本月份未開、遠期較前日均跌三四分不等、惟至二盤後、因粉市之疲而復俏、故賞氣復佳、市面亦見回高、迨至下午開盤、以大户多頭、仍有吸進、且現洋麥之兜售、一時難成事實、所以各月份開價亦復步振、照目下情形、似覺無過落之象、結果本月份較好二分、十二月份好四分、一月份好五分、二月份好二分、三月份好三分、現麥市面、仍然穩俏、開五河麥四元二角、鎭江麥四元、浦東麥三元九角四分、三元九角、由信大去一千包、阜豐去三千包云、</p>

<p>（滬北）各帮來源五十號左右、市上各種去路稍有交易、市形新粳早薄稻價略帶疲勢、羊杜埠·客秈平定、白元酒户進貨尚殷、價疲數分、</p>

<h3>南北貨龍口粉開價轉升</h3>
<p>龍口線粉干前以供過於求、開價極低、最小曾到十七元三角、兹因地頭天寒不便、工作已停止出品、辦價因亦回升、而此間冬銷亦將發動、市勢遂緊、客貨開價回升至十八元、行盤（九二皮）好起五角、呌十七元半、北規呌十八元外、後市或須續升、</p>
<h3>絲茶海外絲銷一蹶不振</h3>

<p>絲廠長吐來源益稀白廠絲歐銷一落千丈、内地絲廠無力支持、大半停工、是以長吐産額日減來源益稀、昨祇無　振藝廠裝到絲廠長吐二十六件云</p>

<h3>難得糊塗</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>因爲有人談起寫篆字，我倒記起鄭板　有一塊圖章，刻着「難得糊塗」。那四個篆字刻得叉手叉脚的，頗能表現一點名士的牢騷氣。足見刻圖章寫篆字也還反映着一定的風格，正像「玩」木刻之類，未必「祇是個人的事情」：「謬種」和「妖孽」就是寫起篆字來，也帶着些「妖謬」的。</p>
<p>然而風格和情緒，傾向之類，不但因人而異，而且因事而異，因時而異。鄭板橋說「難得糊塗」，其實他還能夠糊塗的。現在，到了「求仕不獲無足悲，求隱而不得其地以竄者毋亦天下之至哀歟」的時代，却實在求糊塗而不可得了。</p>
<p>糊塗主義，唯無是非觀等等丨本來是中國的高尚道德。你說他是解脫，達觀罷。也未必。他其實在固執着，堅持着什麽，例如道德上的正統，文學上的正宗之類。這終於說出來了：丨道德要孔孟加上「佛家報應之說」（老莊另賬登記），而說别人「鄙薄」佛敎影響就是「想爲儒家爭正統」，原來同善社的三敎同源論早已是正統了。文學呢？要用生澀的字，用詞藻，穠纎的作品，而且是新文學的作品，雖則他「否認新文學和舊文學的分界」；而大衆文學「固然贊成」，「但那是文學中的一個旁支」。正統和正宗，是明顯的。</p>
<p>對於人生的倦怠並不糊塗！活的生活已經那麽「窮乏」，要請青年在「佛家報應之說」在「文選，莊子，論語，孟子」裏去求得修養。後來，修養又不見了，只剩得字彚。「自然景物，個人情感，宫室建築，……之類，還不妨從「文選」之類的書中去找來用」。從前嚴幾道從甚麽古書裏丨大概也是莊子罷丨找着了「么匿」兩個字來譯Ｕnit，又古雅，又音義雙關的。但是後來通行的却是「單位」。嚴老先生的這類「字彚」很多，大抵無法復活轉來。現在却有人以爲「漢以後的詞，秦以前的字，西方文化所帶來的字和詞，可以拚成功我們的光芒的薪文學」。這光芒要是只在字和詞，那大概像古墓裏的貴婦人似的，滿身都是珠光寶氣了。人生却不在拚凑，而在創造，幾千百萬的活人在創造。可恨的是人生那麽騷擾忙亂，使一些人「不得其地以竄」，想要逃進字和詞裏去，以求「庶免是非」，然而又不可得。眞要寫篆字劉圖章了！</p>
<h3>西湖半日遊紀</h3>
<p>— 吳溪</p>
<p>是一個星期日，天落着微雨，什麽事也不能做，大家都覺着沉悶。於是，有人提議到杭州去玩幾點鐘。這當然没有人反對，而我，想順便去看看舊書，也便參加了。九點五十分，車子從Ｋ站啟行，在風雨聲中前進。這時，野外很清新，兩旁的山峯籠罩着深厚的白色的雲霧，茫茫的大海，透過海塘上疏疏地樹林看去，竟如一片巨大所白雲，在天空緩緩的流動。約莫三刻鐘，到了海寗，我們很想在這裏看一看當日的早潮，那知已經退完了，跑去觀潮亭，所能看到的，只是微微波動着的廣大的海洋，我們當然是很失望。上了車，又向前行。此去杭州，一路上的景物，頗爲幽勝。特殊是那不斷的點綴在青綠的樹林之中的丹楓紅樹，以及綿延數里的竹林，使我們有「身在畫圖中」之感，而覺着此番眞是快游。</p>
<p>十二時，車抵杭州市，雨止了。穿過必經的濘泥的街這，一直開到了樓外樓。在那裏，凭欄看了雨中的湖山，遇到了不少的藝術家型的學生，吃了午飯，難然是杭州飯，但我們旣没有鑪魚，也没有蒓菜。飯後，由杭州的朋友代雇了三隻湖船，來消磨時光。西湖，在我是數年不見了。但這回來，並不能令我對它起什麽親切之感。滿天飛着雨後的烏黑的雲層，我心裏感到的，祇是不盡的壓迫。此山此水，此亭此橋，旣引不起我的詩思，更喚不起我歸向田園之感。仔細的欣賞之下，什麽地方，我都感着是抹上了一層灰色的憂鬱，充滿了矛盾，不安。尤其是那污濁，甚至於發臭的湖水，彷彿給了我一個巨大的啟示；西湖也是在没落過程之中了。在湖上，我的心頭　所快。</p>
<p>我們中的一位引導者，首先領我們去看「劉莊」。據他說，游「劉莊」的人是不能全游的，一部分是封鎖起來的，但是他，因爲某種關係，却有此專利。於是，我們被引向這特殊的禁地了，是　間陳列古董的房子。古董，我們是不懂的，他一一指示我們。這是宋代的大戰鼓，那時兵敗了，劉公把它放在激流下給水冲，敵人以爲是戰鼓，不敢追，後來，搬回來做紀念。這是宋代的什麽，日本人怎麽說，這是明朝的什麽，西洋人曾經出多少錢買。他如數家珍的說，我只是心繫着市頭的古籍，而同伴們，全都是與古董無緣的，眞是空費了他許多的心。這樣白纒了一點多鐘，又遵　他的意旨，到三潭印月一跑了一回石板，大雨便傾盆而來了。風雨歸舟，衣履盡濕，在我却得到另一種快感，空氣没有剛纔的沉悶，而環顧四週，風雨晦冥，彷彿天空就將有一回大的變動。湖上的層峰疊巒，上面全有雲馬奔馳，暗灰的天色，隱約的鐘聲，更使我們心快神怡。</p>
<p>跳下游船，已經是三點半了。怕天很快的會暗黑下來，看舊書是完全無望了。好在來杭州的機會正多，而舊書也並不是非看不可。於是，大家在湖邊隨便買了一　應用的東西，就通過「清泰門」，趕着二百里的歸途了。</p>
<h3>吉林街頭</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>五月的一個早晨，我一個人順着糧米行街往東走，飽吸着四五年没有吸過的吉林長街上的空氣，裝着一個紳士漫步的樣子，（自然紳士不會在大清早漫步的）要看看早上街頭的風景。</p>
<p>街上冷清清的，住家的，小舖子，門都在緊緊地關着，間或有幾輛空着座位的馬車，洋車，看那閑逸的樣子，可以推測出他們才出車廠門，而且他們的睡眼，像還没有睜好呢：但爲了生活，他們不能不委屈一點睡眠的。以很少數目出現在街上的人，差不多都是提筐上市去買菜的，像我這樣在街上走着的，找不出第二個。</p>
<p>當我走到女子師範門口，看到那掛在門口的五色旗時，才知道是禮拜天了，幾天來糊里糊塗地把日子都過忘了。恰當這時，江沿街天主堂的鐘聲，密接地敲了起來，是號召天主的信徒們去作禮拜。時候才只有五點半鐘，雖然暖和的太陽已經溜上了街頭，究竟還不是女學生們起床的時候，因而那門口靜靜地没人出入，祇剩着兩福旗子禁不住晨風地吹打，發出低聲的苦呌。相反的，路的對面一個掛着「怡和祥」鴉片小賣所的門口，正有些駝背黃瘦的人們，穿梭似地進出着，不祇是男人，還有些女人呢，那樣子，分明是很忙碌的。</p>
<p>我漫步的最終目的是朝陽街的菜市，那裏在早上可以說是吉林的一個熱閙地方，我要從熱閙中看出一些什麽來。向前走不遠出新開門，往北拐一段路便到了。五年以前，每天我都要來市上一遍的，用一點點錢！買回家一點蔬菜。雖然每天一次，我並不因爲機械似的而感到厭煩，因爲我在菜市上覓求到一種自已非常滿意的趣味，丨丨我天天覺得有趣的趣味。那就是，在閙哄哄的市面上，以一個中學生的好奇心，天天讓我看出人們在怎樣裝扮着假的面孔，敷衍着，應酬着，交易着。我還以一個中學生的」點智技，盡可能地看出幾幅社會的横斷面。還有，還有别的使我感到有趣的地方，像一個警察以怎樣的手法去獵取一個他所認爲的罪犯或是敗類；一吊錢兩吊錢，（這是吉林的官帖，那時兩吊約合大洋一分），在賣菜人同顧主間有着怎樣的爭執，甚而因此使交易契裂，一個乞丐伸出的污黑的手，顫抖到如何的程度，總之，這些全使我留戀着菜市，使我不覺得厭煩。</p>
<p>這麽想着，已經走出新開門，往北拐，車，馬，人多起來了，我加快了步子「一經路」。</p>
<p>横在我目前的一個釘在臨街洋房磚牆上的藍洋瓷牌子，上面塑着這三個白字。我楞了一下，以爲自已走錯了路，但經過一番仔細的觀察，我的眼睛告訴我所走的路一點也没有錯。這一來，我才知道了是朝陽街換了名字，一經路正是它的替身。從前吉林標明街名的牌子，全是木頭作的，現在換上了藍洋瓷的，想來大概是所謂「滿洲國」治下吉林省城的一種興革罷。尤其是從改過的「經」路名目上看，還可以推出有「緯」路呢，那就說不定是發展什麽大吉林市的一條幹路了。</p>
<p>到菜市了，人一羣一羣地動着，菜担一排一排地排着，賣小玩意的，賣洋火的，賣棕子的……五年前所有的一切景象，依然是我現在看到的景象，一點也没有减少，而我也又像作了五年前的一個吉林公民了。</p>
<p>不過，從量上看來，蔬菜的減少，却是不可掩滅的一種事實，這情形，聽說繼續下來已經半個多月了，因此而起的菜價昻貴，人們萬口同聲地呌　。他們不知道爲什麽菜就少下來，價就貴上去，他們那會想到長春大興土木，建造宫殿，幾萬幾萬的工人要菜吃呢。眞的，好多的菜都運到長春去了。</p>
<p>畢竟還有和五年前景象不同的地方，頭一樣，大羣的苦力，站在街角的「工夫市」等着主顧招僱，人越等越多。不見少。看他們那樣子，分明肚子都空空的，然而，你如　高興往上推出幾個月去，他們之中，有些人正是鄕村裏的富户呢，政治上的紊亂，波及了他們，日本兵同義勇軍交戰，土匪趁火打刦，使他們從自足自給的生活中，一下子跌入飢荒的深淵，他們不得已到城市討求生活，出賣着自已的勞力。第二樣，從賣洋火的起，一直到舖子裏賣的貨物，可以說全是日本貨，便宜呢，誰不願意買，「滿」日携手，取消關稅而引起的日貨暢銷，不管他本身如何，對於一般購買力減少的老百姓說，是有着相當利益的。在人羣中我看到一個坐洋車的警官，車過後，我忽然想到認識他。不錯，我的記憶力到底没有騙我，從身旁一個崗警口中，我打聽到他是曹署長。這使我想起中學裏的曹文牘。他有個日本老婆，就是他在事變後發跡的主因。我想，他該算一個從時勢中造出來的英雄了。我從原路往回走，小舖子，住家的都開了們，人多了，冷清清的街變成了閙哄哄的。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（三十八）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>於是他以他所有的思索力，所有的智能，在他的記憶中搜尋着，想再構成，再看到，再認識，並澈底了解這人，這當他住在巴黎的那些年間，在他面前經過，不曾使得他留心的人。可是他覺到他的行路，他的脚步的輕微的動作，有點擾亂他的思緒，使他的思想不能固定，减損了思索的能力，掩蔽了他的記憶。</p>
<p>爲要對於過去和那些内容不明的事變、作這一覽無遺的銳敏的觀察、他得在一個浩渺幽虚的地方靜止着才行。於是他决定像前天晚上一樣去坐在堤岸上。</p>
<p>當走近碼頭的時候，他聽到海中傳來一聲凄凉的，悲慘的歎息，這聲音和一頭雄牛的嘷鳴相彷，但却呌得更長更有力。這是一個汽笛的呌聲，消失在霧裡的輪船的呌聲。</p>
<p>他覺得像是自已發出來的這臨到危難的呌聲，是這樣響澈了他的靈魂和他的神經，他渾身起了一個戰慄，心都緊縮了。接着又有一個相彷的聲音在悲鳴着，在隔得稍遠的地方；隨後，在他的身旁，碼頭的汽笛回應着那些哨聲，發出一種傷心的呌喊。</p>
<p>筆爾大步地跨上了堤岸，什麽都不再想了，他很滿意自已走進了這愁慘的，怒號着的黑暗裡面。</p>
<p>當他在那防波堤的盡端坐下了的時候，他把眼睛閉上，以便一點也不見到那些被霧遮着的，使碼頭在夜晚現得可親的電燈，和那幾乎看不出來的，南面堤岸上的燈塔的紅光。隨後，他轉過半個身來，把兩肘擱在花崗石上，把他的臉孔隱藏在手裏。</p>
<p>他自已雖然没有用嘴唇說出這個字，可是他的思想却在反覆念着，好像在呌着他，喚起並激出他的影子似的：「瑪賴沙……瑪賴沙。」於是在他那垂下的眼臉的黑暗中，他突然見着他以前所認識的他。這是一個六十歲的男子，有着尖形的白鬍子，眉毛很濃，也全白了。他的身材不高不矮，面貌和靄，眼珠是灰色的，温柔的，舉動謙虚，從外表上看來是一個誠實，樸質，温柔的人。他呌筆爾和哲安做「我親愛的孩子們」，從來没有露出偏愛兩人中之某一個，他邀他們兩人一同到他家裡吃飯。</p>
<p>於是筆爾以一種在探索着一個輕微足跡的狗一般的忍耐，搜尋着這消失在土裡的人的言詞，舉動，音調，眼色等等。他漸漸地把在特龍舍街寓所裡請他和他的弟弟吃飯時，他所見到的瑪賴沙完全發現出來了。</p>
<p>兩個伺候他的老女僕，多時以來便成了習慣地說着「筆爾先生」和「哲安先生」。</p>
<p>當這兩個青年進去時，瑪賴沙便隨便地向他們把兩手伸出，右手給這個，左手給那個。</p>
<p>「好啦，孩子們。你們近來收到過你們雙親的信嗎？至於我呢，他們是從來不寫信給我的。」</p>

<h3>聰明之道</h3>
<p>— 邨人</p>
<p>嚋昔之夜，拜訪世故老人於其廬；廬爲三層之樓、面街而立，雖電車玲玲軋軋，汽車嗚嗚啞啞，市囂擾人而不覺，儼然有如隱士，居處晏如，悟道探也。老人曰，「汝來何事？」對曰，「敢問聰明之道。」談話有主題，遂成問答。</p>
<p>「難矣哉，聰明之道也丨孔門賢人如顔回，舉一隅以三隅反，孔子稱其聰明過人，於今之世能舉一隅以三隅反者尚非聰明之人，汝問聰明之道，其有意難余老瞶者耶？」</p>
<p>「不是不是，你老人家誤會了我的問意了！我工非要晴敎關於思辨之術。我是生性拙直愚笨，處世無方，常常碰壁，敢問關於處世的聰明之道。」</p>
<p>「噫嘻，汝誠拙直愚笨也，又問處世之道！夫今之世，智者見智，仁者見仁，階級不同，思想各異，父子兄弟夫婦姊妹因思想之各異，一家之内各有主張各有成見，雖屬骨肉至親，乖離衝突，背道而馳：古之所謂英雄豪傑，各事其君而爲仇敵，今之所謂志士革命家，各爲階級反目無情，甚至祇因立塲之不同，骨肉至親格殺無赦，投機取巧或能勝利於一時，終　立足於世界，聰明之道實則已窮，且唯旣愚且魯之徒方能享福無邊也矣。…」</p>
<p>「老先生雖然說的頭頭是道理由充足，可是，眞的聰明之道就没有了嗎？」</p>
<p>「然則僅有投機取巧之道也矣。試爲汝言之：夫投機取巧之道要在乎滑頭，而滑頭已成爲專門之學問，西歐學理分門别類有所謂科學哲學者，滑頭之學同實可稱爲滑頭學。滑頭學如依大學敎授之編講義，大可分成若干章，每章分成若干節，每節分成若干項，引古據今，中西合璧，其理論之深奥有甚於哲學，其引證之廣大舉凡中外歷史，物理化學，藝術文學，經商貿易之道，誘惑欺騙之術，概屬必列，包羅萬象，自大學預科以至大學四年級此一講義僅能講其千分之一，大學畢業各科及格，此滑頭學則無論何種聰明絶頂之學生皆不能及格，且大學敎授本人恐亦知其然不知其所以然，其難學也可想　知之矣。余處世數十年，頭頂已秃，鬚髮已白，閱歷不爲不廣，敎訓不爲不多，然而余着手編輯滑頭學講義，僅能編其第一章之第一節，第一節之第一項也。此第一章之第一節，第一節之第一項其綱目爲「順水行舟」，即人云亦云，亦即人之喜者喜之，人之惡者惡之是也。舉一例言之，如人之惡者爲孝子，所謂封建宗法社會之禮敎遺孽之一，則汝雖曾經爲父侍湯服藥問醫求卜出諸天性以事親人，然論世之出諸天性以事親人者則引「孝子」之名以責難之，惟求青年之鼓掌稱快，勿管本心見解及自已行動之如何也。被責難者處於時勢潮流之下，百辭菓辯則反動更爲證實，從此青年鳴鼓而攻，體無完膚，汝之勝利不但已操左劵，且爲青年奉爲至聖大賢，小品之集有此一篇，風行海内洛陽紙貴，於是名利雙收，當貴無邊矣。其第一章之第一節，第一節之第一項爲「投井下石」，余本亦知一二，然偶一憶及投井下石之人，殊覺頭痛，實無心編之也。然而滑頭學雖屬聰明之道，實乃左道旁門，汝實不足學也。」</p>
<p>「老先生所言想亦很有道理，現在社會上將這種學問作敲門磚混飯吃的人實在不少，他們也實在到處逢源，名利雙收，可是我是一個拙直愚笨的人，恐怕就要學也學不了吧？」</p>
<p>「嗚呼汝求聰明之道，而不學之，雖屬可取，然碰壁也宜矣！」</p>
<p>是夕問道於世故老人，歸來依然故我，嗚呼噫嘻！</p>

<h3>做人須知附註</h3>
<p>— 何處去</p>
<p>做人總怕不會笑。若是能夠時時笑，處處笑，我敢說他是没人不討好的。大家都都知道笑是表示快樂，惟其是表示快樂，所以人人喜歡。</p>
<p>反轉來說，哭是誰都討厭的；尤其討厭的，是那種愁眉苦臉。因爲一個人向我一哭無非是向我投訴哀情，而愁眉苦臉呢，也無非要我援他一手。而這兩般都是使人一樣傷腦經的。因爲前者無非想迫取我的同情，而後者却是迫我　口袋。</p>
<p>假使是個某種年齡某種容貌的女子，向我哭哭，向我愁愁，却也還有可說。因爲這到底不是一種「有出無入」的慈善樂捐。誰也知道在這裏面還是可以撈點某種東西轉來的。至於此外呢，則祇有一種一點没代價的破鈔。那是祇要稍微有點聰明的人誰都會絶對不幹的。</p>
<p>所以人不怕最會笑，最會笑他就最會討人喜歡了。</p>
<p>譬如你在大官之下做小官。有一天恰好有點小事弄糟了丨糟到惹起了大官爺的冲天大怒。於是他會把你呌了去。起初，他會桌子一拍，駡你一聲「媽的Ｘ」，終竟因爲你糟得太糟　，於是他便會越來越怒。怒到某種田地了，他會躍然地一跳起來，給你臉上幾巴掌。這時候呢，假便你哭了，或是氣你了你却糟上加糟。因爲哲學家曾經告訴我們，說大爺怒的時候，你旣哭不得，你又氣不得，你若哭了氣了，你便會變了他的火上之油。結果你越會惹起他的「老脾氣」來了。這時候，你最好是「滿面春風」，「笑容可掬」，把那臉上發燒的一節掀在一邊。他若再打，你便再笑。一個人打得總會手軟的。並且他打你也無非是殺殺火氣。火氣有盡期，打人也會有北日。火氣殺住了，自然他也不會再打下來。那時候，你便靜待一個時期。這時期一到，他便會呌你出去。於是你便可以帶笑的走了。讓他一個人去思量思量。在這裏你知道，一個人總是有良心的。大官爺也是人，所以你也總可以去相信。等到他良心作用發作了。他便會想起你的好處。「呀，莫說，這小子却也有點好處」，他會這樣地想。這樣地想過，他便會想起你從前替他出過力的地方。這時候，他會說，「這小子，從前出過力，現在還是一點不露驕。我這樣待他，到像有點委屈他了」。到了這時候，他便會開始覺得有點難過了。結果呢，他一定會在你的領章上加上一顆小星兒。</p>
<p>叽，這樣看來，你豈不是福由笑來的？反之呢，你假使激起他的狠氣來了</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，你怕他不會擲掉你？</p>
<p>所以，做人便要操着會笑。見了人就要笑，没有人也要笑；見了大爺的時候固然要笑，就是上坑厠的時候也不可不笑；白晝裏要記着笑，睡夢裏也要記着笑。總之，你要把會笑馴成了一種本能。反之，你死了爹也不要哭，死了媽也不要哭；走了愛人也不要哭，送了東三省也不要哭。總之，你要把不哭也馴成了一種本能。如是滿面春風，到處是笑。人家見了你，個個喜歡。而你的飯碗便成了鐵打的了。</p>
<h3>隨筆</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>這次海京伯大馬戲班降臨到咱們的上海來，把整個上海「其實上海以外，還有京滬，滬杭路渦線，以及上海左近大小的城市，大小的農村，）都轟動了，需要剌激的老爺太太，少爺小姐奶奶們，都結着隊發狂般的從Ｂus裏在「大華」舊址前流了出來，又一窩蜂地湧到一輛在小窗口掛了「一元二元票售完」牌子的售票的鐵車前，爭先恐後地擁擠着把鈔票洋錢向鐵車裏的坐在牢籠内的囚犯似的售票人手裏硬塞着：「二元的没有了，買三元的：」「管他娘，四元的就四元的，一生只這一回哪。」……只一刹那，一張張的顔色的門劵，換去了結實的一抽屜大大小小花花綠綠的現鈔票…………聽人說，中國人太窮了。可是「大華」舊址前的扮演，它告訴我們說：中國人何嘗窮呢？眞是「大爺有的是鈔票洋鈿哪」，豪爽慷慨極了，一些没有心麻肉痛的尶𡯓顔色哩！</p>
<p>這事情，是在飽過眼福的朋友回來以最愉快最緊張的神情告訴我說了「這一馬戲放過太可惜，這生做人都枉做了！你挪債，也應該去看一次」以後，我便在一個星期天上午十點半鐘的時候，懷了六毛大洋滿心歡喜地跑去買票，没有買着，我便顚起脚尖，伸長頸子，被擠在人堆的最後層，以好奇的心望着的事情。這事情，深深地刻劃着我的腦膜上，至今依然顯明地深刻着。</p>
<p>這一大馬戲，已經閙了一個多月了，據說節目已換成嶄新的了，朋友門看了第二次回來又在指手劃脚眉飛色舞的描摹他的看得的「奇蹟」了，可是，從那一次打了回票以後，我天天坐在Ｂus裏打「大華」面前過，我是再不敢有一點兒勇氣和决心跑去賣票了，（那次以後，袋裏不會那樣凑巧的懷着六毛大洋，也是實在的！）滿心裏懷着好像有一隻猛獅將要打那「小窗口」裏跳出來一口把我吞掉般的恐怖！丨丨但是，天天都是一樣的，在那塊「帳幕」前的曠塲上熙熙攘攘忙碌着的總是有一大堆數不清的老爺太太，小姐少爺奶奶在，我懷疑他們還是昨天來了就没有散去的。</p>

<h3>誰？還呌我四姑娘哩</h3>
<p>— 友生</p>
<p>她穿着最新式的長旗袍，外面罩着一九三三年的秋季外套，脚上着的高根皮鞋，走起路來咯咯地作響，手中拿着銀行儲蓄會贈送的皮篋，興冲冲地前行</p>
<p>，街上的行人，誰都要向她瞟上一眼，不像以前做工時代的她，原來她現在已爲副官的太太了。</p>
<p>也現在瞧見從前同做工的人，覺得她們都是些下流，俗物，……不屑和她們攀談，就是她的同工者有些時見到她，招呼她一聲「四姑娘！回來了，」她總不高興理會她們，因爲現在的她；已被傭人稱爲太太的身分了，而這些不識時務的人，丨同工者丨徧要喊她「四姑娘」，她覺得「四姑娘」三個字，是多麽剌耳的名詞，倘使給現在同打牌的太太們聽到；那是多麽地不雅觀啊。</p>
<p>她有一次和她的老爺丨丈夫丨回到母家來，將走到自家門口的時候，就聽見「四姑娘！回來了，」她不高興地回轉頭來一看，見是隔壁的張三姐，和凌四奶奶，丨同工者丨在喊她，她本來聽到「四姑娘」就十分地不高興，何况今天同做官長的丈夫在一起走呢，於是她就把頭一低，睬也不睬她們，就進門去了。張三姐，和凌四奶奶，很熱烈地呌她，不料她竟不眯她們，於是她們就指桑駡槐地大駡起來；出這一口不啋她們的怨氣。</p>
<p>「哼！有幾個臭錢，就威武起來了，不要說丈夫不過做了一個小官兒，就是從前中了狀元，尚且回家拜四鄰呢，哼！小Ｘ，你的根底有誰不知？……」張三姐氣噴噴地駡着「做工的時候，更和工頭搭訕，看看戲更和這小官兒搭起拚頭來，被父母知道了，硬拉出人來做媒，不要臉的東西，蝦蟆跳秤盤還要自尊自大，老娘，身價比你高……跟了武裝官兒走路就不睬人了……」凌四奶奶和阿着。</p>
<p>「眞的，」張三姐又道，「自尊自貴没有，要别人稱你太太才行呢，記不得從前做工的時候，央求我們敎她做活，</p>

<h3>上海（二）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（三）美麗的姑娘</p>
<p>做著美夢的人們，已回到殘酷的人間。他們没有注意到有不能享受那刹間美夢的孤獨者，整理他們的行裝，掙扎今天的開始。我呆望着東方的太陽，似乎一個美麗的姑娘對我微笑。她笑我昨夜没有享受美夢嗎，還是笑我没有故鄕，布爾喬亞的小姐啊，你僅是一個美麗的姑娘，而没有美麗的靈魂！你笑我嗎？太陽已展開美麗的前程，我不需要没有靈魂的女人。定眼看時，正是昨晚和我同上車的那女子。她並不微笑，似乎躊躇着怎樣和我啓齒。但是我不認識她，不過的確竭力想搜查認識她的記號，那修長的眉毛，發光的眼珠，端正的鼻子，弧形的小唇，以及整個的臉兒；如其她的身材不被小桌遮蔽，我更將搜查她胸部抵足的每一部份，因爲她太像我小時候走失的姐姐。見她欲言又止的態度，我更疑惑地多看了她幾眼。她似乎明瞭雙手狐疑的苦悶，俯近身來問：</p>
<p>「你是李青萍弟弟嗎」！</p>
<p>是細小的聲音，確是我姐姐的口吻。</p>
<p>「你是敏姊？」</p>
<p>「你是認識！」</p>
<p>她笑了，我没有細味她她語氣，槍着說：</p>
<p>「你……怎……」</p>
<p>「鄕下空氣太悶到上海去玩玩。」</p>
<p>雙方的誤會已解决，我太神經過敏，我姐姐不是布爾喬亞的小姐。但是她知道我的姓氏，稱我弟弟，也自認敏姊，始終記不起她倒底是誰，我不好意思地望着窗外。</p>
<p>美麗的太陽已普照人間，車靠上海北站月臺。</p>
<p>（四）上海的黃包車夫</p>
<p>踏出車站，她走在我前面，她以爲我跟着她走，跳上黃包車問我：</p>
<p>「那裏去？」</p>
<p>「上旅館。」</p>
<p>我因爲没有預定的目的，隨口說了。</p>
<p>「我也上旅館。」</p>
<p>她老是細小的聲音說話，車夫遵着她的吩咐向前跑，</p>
<p>我的車夫，也拉起車杠跟着前面的車子跑。據說上海的黃包車夫，比内地小學敎員還聰明；祇要你歪歪嘴，他會知道你要到的地方。這一回他却失敗了，我自已還没有决定到什麽旅館，也没有隨她進同一旅館的意思，却不好意思在跑了幾條馬路以後再更正路由罷了。像綁票似的車子在南京路的大東旅館門前停下，至今想起來，那車夫還是勝利的。</p>
<p>無可奈何地跟進了電梯。</p>
<p>「咦，你也住這裏！」</p>
<p>我不提防這是從美麗的姑娘底小唇間漏出來的話，那掌梯的Ｂoy，輕視的瞥我一眼，他以爲我是卑鄙的人吧？</p>
<p>「鬼！你這無靈鬼的女人，爲的你像我走失的姐姐，别以小布爾喬亞的意識輕視我，瞧吧，我要報仇！」</p>
<p>我像敵人一樣的怒視她，</p>
<p>在二樓上，我逃出了電梯。</p>
<p>更正拙作「童年斷片的回憶，」錯排之處頗多，除無甚關係之錯字錯句不再更正外；昨日（二十一）刊布之首段：「祥大到底是祥大，因爲放了三年的牛，……一個觔斗打下水去，半個時辰還不見有動靜。」應與今日（二十二）刊布之首段；「挨過了一刻鐘的光景……抵不過「回來時給你一碗蛋炒飯」一句的動聽，」互調。又昨日所登者爲第十節，今日爲第十一節，特此更正。列火，十一，二十二。</p>

<h3>一位肯說公道話的女人（下）</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>她說，離婚的原因大半在乎女子　「準備」是她提出的惟一補救方法</p>
<p>「我四面八方，聽見種種議論，研究離婚率可怖增加的原因，但可惜竟没有一個人提到女人的「無凖備」方面的。現代的妻子儘管在外面打牌，吃酒，在美容院裏過着日子，或者駕了汽車，在郊外馳騁着，處處都顯示着他們對於家事的漠不關心。我並不是假道學。我亦不是說這些事是不可以做的。但是我以爲這些事祇可有限制的享樂些。做妻子的，還是要先做像了妻子，再去做别的事情爲妙。要是一個女子，有能幹的話，她在處理一切家政妥當之後，儘有游玩的功夫。就怕是一個女人，没本事處理家事，一味地貪玩。</p>
<p>「不久之前，我在一個朋友家裏打牌。到了下午五點鐘，牌是早已打完了，我就要想走。大家都說早得很呢。我說我一定要回家預備晚飯的。他們聽了大家都詫異起來，一個電影女明星，晚上還要回家預備晚飯！那不是個笑話嗎？但是在我個人方面，那並不是什麽笑話。我除去在攝影塲拍戲之外，每天的晚飯都是我親自監督著作的。我還有時親自動手哩。</p>
<p>後來不久那般人的中間，笑我笑得最厲害的一個，居然和她的丈夫離婚了。她的離婚，是她丈夫暗中主張的。據人家告訴我的，那位夫人結婚了多少年，從來没有進過一次廚房；男人的衣服鞋襪等等，從來没有料理過；也從來没有到過小菜場，買過菜蔬。她的丈夫，常常獨自一個人，在家裏吃晚飯：而他的夫人呢，却在外面打牌，茶會，或者竟出遠門去了。當然做這種女人的丈夫，比做光棍還要痛苦，因爲他名義上是有家室的，實際上是祇有經濟的担負，並且他亦不能再和别的女性有什麽來往。這是多痛苦的一件事呀！</p>
<p>「要是我僅指出離婚盛行的原因，而不說出補救的方法來我一定要受人的指責。我現在所要指出的補救方法，就是「準備」兩個字。每個女子在未婚之前，應當受過一種家政的訓練。她應當知道待丈夫和待上司一樣，要遵守時刻。上司有脾氣的時侯，在他手下做事的人祇可認耐些；而妻子對待丈夫亦應當如此。總而言之，處處應當設法成爲一個值得稱爲「妻」的妻子。</p>
<p>「以上所說的，我自已正在身體力行着。我現在是很快樂的，但我不能預言永遠能如此。這並不是我没有創造維持快樂家庭的决心，實在是因爲一個人的前程，是極難斷定的。我想到快樂竊盡的時侯，夫妻間關係不能維持了，離婚是惟一的出路。但是每個已婚的男女，都應當竭力設注避免一切妨害家庭和樂的爭執，竭力設法創造家庭的快樂。」（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「四十二號街」４２ndＳtreet</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>就這一影片本身來說，那Ｓtojy的組織就是非常嚴密的。其中以喬其白蘭德所飾的譚寗和魯拍基萊所飾的白姫之問的關係，最爲巧妙，次之如琵琵姐妮兒所飾的桃樂賽，發現上述二人之親暱，也極自然。自然這完全是戀愛糾紛的故事。可是在這一範圍之中，像這裏的故事，却是非常好的。很明顯的，劇作者很輕鬆的暴露了現社會淫靡的黃金臭味；大富翁爲了　愛一個女伶而欲使其成爲明星，不惜以巨資組織歌舞班。女伶一方面固然結愛富翁，而另一方面却盡情和自已的愛人纒綿。歌舞班的導演爲了討好富翁，使其不取回資金，居然以卑劣的手叚向女伶的情人恫嚇。而女伶的情人眼看着愛人和富翁交好，於是便和另一女伶往來。丨如上所述，這不單是男女間的糾紛而已，也可以說是社會道德頽敗的縮影。雖然這不是嚴重的處理社會問題，然而也是現社會眞實的暴露。至於劇作者使女伶反抗富翁而放棄虚榮與原來的情人結婚，自然是勇敢的而以戀愛至上主義爲主旨。但是他也不肯忽視富翁金錢的魔力，在富翁懷裡，少不了有安痕來代替桃樂賽的地位。同時，編劇者對於這種　與肉的買賣表示不滿，不僅是在旅館中有着兩幕充分的表示，而在華納裴克斯所飾的導演口中道出：「到明天早上爲止，請將戀愛的事情暫時忘記，好好的休息一下。」（大意）</p>
<p>關於導演，我以爲有了一個好的劇本，導演是不大費事的。自然在最後舞台上歌舞的一塲，無疑的是美國電影藝術純熟的表現。</p>
<p>現在我想零亂的指出這一影片的優點、就我的記憶中還留有印象的地方。</p>
<p>攝影是好極了，那種明快的光與影，以及靈活的鏡頭角度。有許多美麗的畫面，可見攝影機的特殊效能。我們固然不承認那大腿之林，是文化的表現，可是攝影者在那幾個鏡頭中却顯着極大的聰明。</p>
<p>服裝顔色的配置，也是很好的。那黑與白的顔色鮮明，在那場歌劇中，有如白色的花在全黑的空間閃耀。特别全白的衣褲，加上幾粒黑鈕扣，更爲奇妙。</p>
<p>火車寢床上的一場，當大家都閉幔就寢，黑人拾着鞋子走過去了後，所謂第一次結婚的新婦自帳中拿出一雙鞋子。幔幔的掉在地上，其表現新夫婦之親暱，眞所謂别開生而。</p>
<p>琵琵姐妮兒是演得最好的一個，那一場媚人的歌舞，包圍在四個男性之中，純熱之極。此外在旅館中打富翁之後，再驅逐其他女人，再接上是含着眼涙打電話，直至開門抱着情人熱烈的接吻，白姫跑進來而因之嫉妒，都是最聰明的表演技藝。</p>
<p>華納裴克斯自然也是最好的。抱病導演歌劇，精疲力竭，以致待人暴戾，一貫的把握着劇中人的特性。直至散戲時在門外竊聽觀衆的批評，快樂的微笑，更見精采。</p>
<p>飾白姫的ＲubyKecler也很有成績，一貫的少女風度，這不是一般人所能做到。其他諸人都極盡職，尤其是那一個富翁。</p>
<p>這一篇評文寫得很潦草，然於此已可概見這一作品之一斑了。給厭倦的人們去娱樂一番，誰曰不宜？</p>
<h3>「歌塲艶韵」評　ＭyrtandMavge</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>像「歌塲艶史」的故事當然是極平凡的。有錢的公子爲了一個歌女，而竟謀做歌舞團，經理，多少表示出金錢的　力，當然我絶對不會像機械的「輪客」那樣，認有錢就有罪惡的，經濟的能夠製造罪惡。發展罪惡，只是爲了他的不平恒。金錢只有客觀的存在。</p>
<p>導演者的强調在「趣味」方面，是必然的，在决定採取這故事的時候，他已經着眼於這方面了。所以他不但在畫面上·把他誇張，同時更加把許多不必要的滑稽加入。而表現這滑稽，也用盡了全部力量，笑料本來需要妙手偶得，俯拾卽是。一做作，就喪失了趣味，這是「歌場艶史」的致命傷。</p>
<p>很多影片在故事的開展上常常不能把提着故事的中心線索。本來「素材」經過剪裁面成「主題」，已經刪了很多枝葉了，但是人事的雜雜，和時間的進展，不能不用無數　面堆積起來，在這無數的畫面中，一定要使觀衆們有統系的「看」下去，不可使觀衆爲畫面所述，而分散了他的主意力。現在「歌場艶史」却十足的具有這一個缺點，劇本的瑣碎，加以剪接的雜亂，雖然觀衆，不感到割裂支離，其可得乎？</p>
<p>但是小地方，特别的個别的鏡頭，到有較好的地方。像舞台幾個場面，鏡頭地位的放置，詎離遠近的支配，都很奇異而適當。</p>
<p>至於暗中毆鬥的場面，是運用聲音來表現，這種在有聲片中，當然是常見的。此外在聲影不同的塲面的應用，尚稱得當。</p>
<h3>皮皮黛妮兒在歐</h3>
<p>— 華明</p>
<p>皮皮黛妮兒這一次去到歐洲加入高蒙影片公司，竟在英國大出風頭。她在高蒙影片公司所演的第一部英國片，是一部歌舞巨片。在這部影片中，皮皮黛妮兒有極精美的歌曲，高蒙公司爲皮皮黛妮兒須要適當的對角，曾在各處找尋，結果在英國舞臺界中找到了一個素負盛名的名歌家華德威道潑ＷalterWiddop他在英國歌家中曾使全歐聞名，這一次他進高蒙公司同皮皮黛妮兒二人合演是一件偶然的事。他並不想進影界，但是同皮皮黛妮兒合演影片，却是他所夢想的一件事。其他幾個演員，有一個是英國名戲曲家佛克多華爾可尼，一個是在「春江花月夜」一片中得名的賈克霍爾勃的哥哥克勞台霍爾勃：高蒙公司爲尊重皮皮黛妮兒起見，這幾個配角，都是皮皮黛妮兒自已選定的。</p>
<p>這一次皮皮黛妮兒在歐洲，替美國影界中大爭其面子，英國影界名人都稱贊皮皮黛妮兒不止，有人說她今年不再回好萊塢了，但皮皮黛妮兒的丈夫賓利昻絶對否認，他說皮皮至多在英國拍二部片子即當重返好萊塢云。</p>
<h3>香草美人行將公映</h3>
<p>陳鏗然入明星公司之第一部作品「健美之路」問世後，即繼續努力。同時開拍「展覽會」，「香草美人」，片。「香草美人」業已於月前竣工送呈電檢會通過，將於月内在新光大戲院公映。是片要角一爲鄕姑娘夏佩珍，其表情早已蜚聲國内，而專飾反派角色之謝雲卿君在此飾一正派工人，有特殊成功，劇中寫一烟草工廠工人之家，爲寫實之作。</p>
<h3>「豐年」未剪接已開映</h3>
<p>李萍倩自編自導之「豐年」自經三次赴蘇攝完外景後，現正在趕接中。但事爲好萊塢影業所聞。目爲中國影片打倒舶來片之力傑。亦趕攝外國「豐年」運滬交大光明大戲院開映，李導演聞訊之下。昨特赴該院參觀一次。聞該片亦爲描寫農村經濟組織爲資本主義破壞後之慘痛者。惟與中國「豐年較，則尚不及甚遠云。</p>
<h3>電影小說香草美人（三）</h3>
<p>— 田夫</p>
<p>（五）一個人的「犯罪」！</p>
<p>時間又過了一年。日子一步步地向艱難的境地裡陷，愁苦祇是在王阿大一家人的心裡滋長起來。現在，家裏又多了一個食口，阿大家的又養了一個孩子；現在，家又少了一個生産的人，女兒在廠裏的生意停歇了。淘着米，洗着菜，女人老對那難得有滿的飯籮子嘆氣。「算來算去，每月賺的這樣這樣少，我們上海没有日子過！」</p>
<p>「可是到鄕下去也没日子過哩！」</p>
<p>於是一串愁色深深地鎖住了母女兩個的眉頭。誰知道公司老虧本，這時又宣佈了减工錢的消息。情形也是眞的，光景公司也過不了；管工的儔解釋着請諸位幫忙。</p>
<p>阿大的兄弟大聲喊：「我們每人只賺十幾塊錢一個月，還要扣減嗎？氣力一樣用，飯可以少吃？」可見阿大覺得無可奈何，他怕失業，他願意接受减工資的條件。</p>
<p>弟弟贊成罷工，哥哥反對：爲了意見的不同，弟兄倆也閙開了。</p>
<p>「老大，告訴你：你巴望外國人不搶中國人生意，做老板的不刻薄工人，那是辦不到的，你别做夢！」</p>
<p>「可是我怎麽也不贊成罷工！」</p>
<p>「我們誰都同了心，不想自已的阿哥倒這樣，怪不得人家說你是走狗！」</p>
<p>兩個閙着，閙着；十幾個偵探和警察推了門進來。「這罷工的傳單是你發的？」</p>
<p>老二昂然點着頭。屋子裡立刻騷亂起來，翻箱倒篋的一陣了，弟兄兩個被帶走了。</p>
<p>「鼓動罷工」：老二在這罪名底下被判監禁二年。一家四口，這樣就祇剩下阿大一個在拚命支撑。</p>
<p>（六）爲了吃飯</p>
<p>不幸的事情全都來到：大中華烟廠終於倒閉了。吃的，住的，如今過日子就像在走奈何橋。</p>
<p>天見憐！幸而女兒找到了生意：據說是在什麽衛生公司做事。是什麽事情他可不明白。問問女兒，她囁嚅着：「是一種帶點醫藥性質的生意，我做夜班。」還是不明白；可是管它，反正是爲了吃飯！</p>
<p>日子是這麽勉强打發過了，自已再做一點零工。是個把月以後的一個晚上，凑着女兒出門上工，打扮花枝招展的就如一位摩登小姐。阿大一楞，呌住了她：「你看看你自已，打扮成個什麽樣子！」</p>
<p>女兒没回話，終於走了。父親的心裡可老不自在：女孩子有了一個職業就可以這樣浪費囑？他看不慣！</p>
<p>廠裡原說是暫時停工的，開廠的消息却老没有。一天，他到廠門口去探了消息回來，心裡懷喪着，却在女兒的房裡發見了一個奇異的景致：女兒　在調着脂粉往臉上搽，一個西裝少年坐在她旁邊。</p>
<p>阿大覺得有一股寒氣騫然從頭頂凉下足尖，却有一股怒氣從脚底衝上頭頂，咬緊牙關跑過去就是丨拍！一個嘴巴子。（未完）</p>

<h3>Central Executive Committee Resolution to Permanently Expel Chen Mingshu and Others from the Party, and Hand Them Over to the Government for Strict Apprehension; Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to be Convened on a Fixed Date</h3>

Ye Chucang chaired the meeting, and the resolutions were as follows: (1) Resolved, that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and Chen Youren, taking advantage of internal and external troubles and the serious national crisis, betrayed the Republic of China and harmed the people. They should be permanently expelled from the Party and referred to the Control Yuan for confirmation, and handed over to the government for strict apprehension.

(6) It was recommended that Dai Chuanxian report at next Monday's Central Commemorative Weekly Report. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee decided to convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee on the 20th of next month. According to a Central Committee member, in view of the severity of the national crisis and the emergence of the Fujian Incident, in order to earnestly unite and jointly plan for national salvation, it was decided to convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee next month. Due to the short timeframe, the Secretariat was immediately ordered to prepare without delay and to telegraph all Central Committee members residing in various locations to come to Nanjing to attend and jointly discuss national affairs. It is noted that the first session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee was held in Nanjing in the 20th year [of the Republic], the second session was held in Luoyang last spring, and the third session was held in Nanjing last winter. The fourth session is now scheduled to be held next month. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Yao Cong Flies to Hangzhou for On-the-Ground Inspection</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang, considering that Zhejiang Province is adjacent to Fujian and that maintaining security is particularly important, specially dispatched Yao Cong, his aide-de-camp, to Zhejiang Province for inspection. Yao flew to Hangzhou from Jiangxi by plane on the 23rd and, after liaising with the Zhejiang provincial authorities, will proceed to Wenzhou and other counties on the border between Fujian and Zhejiang for on-the-ground inspection, and will provide on-site instructions for military deployment to maintain security. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Reliable sources from the provincial government confirm that the province had already paid attention to preparing defenses on the Zhejiang border before the Fujian Incident broke out. After the Fujian Incident, troops were redeployed and defenses were strengthened, so security is not a concern. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Administration, said that after the political change in Fujian Province, the central government is seeking ways to respond and has not made any preparations for military action. Training is still being carried out as usual here. Air school planes are being piloted by senior students for long-distance flight practice. Planes flew to Nanjing, Nanchang, Ningbo, and other places both yesterday and today, with no special missions. He denied that planes were dispatched to scout the Zhejiang-Fujian border. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Central Government Plans to Send Senior Officials South</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Central Committee member, at the beginning of the establishment of the reactionary organization in Fujian, it was promoted that contact would be made with Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Now the authorities of all provinces have indicated that they will not cooperate. Hu Zhantang particularly loathes and detests this kind of rebellion against the Premier and violation of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the Southwest authorities are taking the same attitude as the Central Government in responding to Fujian. In order for the Central Government to earnestly discuss concrete measures with the Southwest authorities and to welcome Hu and others to come to Beijing, it was decided to send senior officials south. During yesterday's Central Political Conference, it was proposed to invite Wu Zhihui or Dai Jitao to go, but both of them declined. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Yu Youren's Thoughts on the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Youren returned to Beijing from Shaanxi on the 23rd. Yu said that when he set out from Shaanxi, he heard of the Fujian Incident. At a time when external wounds are becoming increasingly urgent and internal worries have not yet ceased, this unexpected change of betrayal of the Party and the country has occurred. I deeply regret the actions of those who initiated the trouble. It is caused by being instigated by misguided elements, leading to straying onto the wrong path and disrupting the entire country and nation. At this time, we only know to firmly uphold the Party's position and consolidate the leadership of the revolution. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Declares No Support for Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the organization of a puppet government by Chen Mingshu and others to betray the Central Government, and external rumors that the Japanese side had provided assistance, on the afternoon of the 23rd, a representative of the Japanese Embassy went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and made an informal statement that Japan had neither participated in the Fujian Incident beforehand nor would it do so in the future, and would maintain this position. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Yang Shao Request Punishment of Chen Mingshu and Others</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng, Director of Pacification of Shaanxi and Gansu, and Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Provincial Government, telegraphed the National Government on the 23rd, stating that Chen Mingshu and others had betrayed the Party and the country, colluded with the Communist bandits, and pursued their selfish desire to dominate the territory. They are public enemies of the people of the whole country. They requested that a clear order be issued for their punishment and strict handling, so that the rebellion can be quelled as soon as possible and the foundation of the country will not be shaken. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Wang Mengbin Arriving in Beijing Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Shanghai newspaper on the 23rd, Wang Mengbin, commander of the Mawei port, arrived in Beijing aboard the Hai Ning warship. According to a certain official in the Navy Department speaking to reporters, this news is completely untrue. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Beijing Receives Declaration from Fujian Side</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The puppet government organized by the Fujian rebels was completed on the 20th and issued a false declaration. Some in Beijing have already received it. The wording is absurd and the content is roughly the same as that revealed in Chairman Chiang's letter to the officers and men of the Nineteenth Route Army. The policies it advocates are all plagiarized from the heresies of the Third Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party, like sheer nonsense. Various parties do not attach importance to this. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Fujianese in Beijing Telegraph Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fujianese compatriots in Beijing telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Government on the 23rd, forwarding it to Mr. Li Renchao, Chen Zhenru, Jiang Jingran, and Cai Xianchu. At a time when the national crisis is most serious, the sudden emergence of a new organization in the province has shocked the country. The people of Fujian have long been ravaged by bandits and communists. How can they endure another catastrophe? Moreover, the Nineteenth Route Army has a glorious history of resisting Japan. It is deeply regretted that it has been ruined in one fell swoop. It is hoped that you will submit to the true public opinion of the people, immediately abolish the illegal organization, do not indulge in personal selfishness, and do not be held hostage by various factions, so as to avoid the destruction of the local area and the loss of the national foundation. It is not too late to rein in at the edge of the cliff. We are fearful and apprehensive. We only pray that you will heed our advice. They also sent several telegrams to Chen Bonan in Guangzhou, Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong, Li Delin and Bai Chongxi in Guilin, as well as Fujianese associations in various provinces and cities and overseas Fujianese overseas Chinese. The telegrams were copied from the sample telegram. Please note. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao Flies to Jiangxi This Morning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, is scheduled to fly to Jiangxi on the morning of the 24th to meet with Chiang. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Wang Jialie Has No Contact with Fujian</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Deng Houfang, the representative of Guizhou Province in Beijing, told people that the outbreak of the Fujian Incident has caused nationwide panic. As for the so-called Five Provinces Allied Army, Guizhou has not heard of it. It is well known that Wang Jialie obeys the Central Government. In response to this incident, he will abide by the will of the Central Government. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Beiping Military Branch</p>
<h3>Strictly Prevent Communist Party Sabotage</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beiping Military Branch telegraphed the provincial government, stating that the Fujian Incident broke out suddenly and that close attention should be paid to the Communist Party's sabotage conspiracy. The Municipal Party Department is scheduled to hold a meeting on the afternoon of the 24th to telegraph a condemnation of the rebels in Fujian Province. On the 23rd, they telegraphed Jiang Guangnai and Chen Mingshu, urging them to quickly wake up, be loyal to the Party and the country, and rein in at the edge of the cliff, lest it be too late. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Fujian Incident broke out, He received successive telegrams from Chiang, Chen Yi, Chen Jitang, Wu Tiecheng, and others reporting the situation. The Huabei (North China) authorities handled this matter by the Central Government. In addition to having the telegrams delivered to the generals for viewing, He did not make any immediate representations. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Returns to Hankou</h3>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun arrived in Hankou at 9:00 PM on the 23rd aboard the Jianguo ship from Xunyang. Peng Zhenshan came with him. Liu Zhenhua took the same ship from Xunyang to Anqing. He said that the Fujian Incident is not critical to the overall situation. Guangdong and Guangxi do not approve of it, and none of the elders have gone to Fujian. It will soon disappear on its own. Chiang is very indifferent to this and is still working hard to suppress the bandits. In the Battle of Huhuwan in Jiangxi, Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai's puppet 15th and 20th Army Corps were almost completely annihilated. The pursuit and suppression are continuing. It has been decided to transfer a division of Yang Hucheng's Sichuan bandit suppression army to southern Hubei to prevent it from entering Shaanxi. He will go to western and eastern Hubei to inspect in the next few days. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun said that the Central Government has decided to resolve the Fujian issue politically and not militarily. Chiang is upholding this principle and maintaining calm. It is expected that the Fujian issue will not affect the suppression of bandits. He did not mention the matter of the provinces along the Yangtze River issuing a joint telegram. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Sets Off to Inspect Northern Guangdong, Adopts a Policy of Self-Defense on the Border with Fujian; Huang Renhuan's Division Withdraws to Dabu and Jiaoling; Eastern Guangdong Armies Return to Command of Li Yangjing; Monthly Subsidy to the Nineteenth Route Army Suspended</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang set off on the evening of the 22nd to inspect a certain unit in northern Guangdong and will return to the province today or tomorrow. The First Group Army decided on the 22nd to adopt a policy of self-defense on the border with Fujian, ordering Huang Renhuan's division to withdraw from Shanghang and Wuping in Fujian to Dabu and Jiaoling in Guangdong to consolidate defenses. Zhang Ruigui and Li Zhenliang's divisions and the units directly under the Third Army will be responsible for the Chaozhou, Shantou, Xingning, Meixian, and Jieyang areas, and the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters will be ordered to expedite the completion of the main line of the eastern Guangdong highway. The generals of the First Group Army will telegraph their support for the telegram of the Executive Yuan. The wording will be issued after a meeting is convened to discuss it. Chen Jitang has set a deadline of one week for the officers of the Eastern Guangdong armies to return to their posts and preside over military affairs. The Eastern Guangdong armies are all under the command of Li Yangjing. Li set off during the day. On the 22nd, Chen Jitang summoned the directors of the Guangzhou-Shaoguan, Guangzhou-Sanshui, and Guangzhou-Kowloon railway bureaus to inquire in detail about the train schedules to facilitate military movements. The Central Government has stopped paying the Nineteenth Route Army's subsidies, which amount to 700,000 yuan per month, and has reallocated them to the southern route. Liu Luyin came to Hong Kong again on the 22nd to meet with Hu. The Nineteenth Route Army's office in Guangdong was still open on the 23rd, and all staff were ordered by Cai to refrain from making statements. Weng Guiqing has gone to Hong Kong.

<h3>Leaders of the Fujian Situation All Scheduled to Take Office Today; Division Commanders of the Nineteenth Route Army Will Return to Their Defenses Separately; Foreign Telegrams Report Internal Strife</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The ministers of the Exterior and Finance, the chairmen of the Cultural and Military Councils, all the committee members, and He Gonggan, the governor of Fujian Province, are all scheduled to take office on the morning of the 24th. Yang Tingying went to Mawei yesterday to take over the First Brigade. The division commanders of the Nineteenth Route Army will return to their defenses separately after the Military Council meeting tomorrow. Xu Qian believes that since the revolutionary government is urgently focused on the progress of military affairs and the economy, the judiciary should be temporarily maintained as it is. Wei Datong, the former president of the High Court, has resumed his post, and the reorganization of the court is expected to be postponed. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Fuzhou, the leaders of the independence movement in that area have already begun to quarrel with each other.

<p>(Guangzhou) All Chinese-language newspapers here this morning carried editorials criticizing Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen and supporting the provincial government's opposition to the Fujian Province independence movement, while urging the authorities to immediately take strict measures to deal with it. The government's official newspaper said that Fujian Province is reaching an understanding with Japan on the one hand and allying with the Communist bandits on the other. Therefore, it still views dictatorship as inferior. According to well-informed sources in Guangzhou, Fujian Province's most urgent goal is to invade Guangdong Province. The Guangzhou authorities have now officially announced their attitude. It is expected that matters will proceed rapidly. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues Letter to Bandit Suppression Soldiers; Chen, Li, et al. Have Isolated Themselves From the People and Are Not Enough to Become a Major Disaster; Hoping for Increased Efforts to Continue Bandit Suppression and Maintain Order</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chiang is extremely calm after the Fujian Incident and is still proceeding with the suppression of the Red Army as usual. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang's telegram to bandit suppression soldiers and military officers across the nation regarding the Fujian Incident read: For years, the Communist bandits have been wreaking havoc and spreading poison throughout several provinces, destroying the fundamental organizations of our nation and society. The survival of the nation is threatened, and all efforts to resist foreign aggression and defend the country cannot be effectively implemented. Our loyal and brave soldiers have joined forces to focus solely on bandit suppression. As a result of hard battles and fierce fighting, the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have been cleared. The suppression in central Jiangxi is also showing results. The policy of blockade and encirclement is enough to control the bandits. Given time, they can be gradually pacified. Unexpectedly, Chen Mingshu and others colluded and compromised with the Communist Party. On the 20th, they organized a puppet government in Fujian and suddenly staged a rebellion. Such perverse actions are self-isolating from the people and will inevitably lead to collapse. They are not enough to become a major disaster. However, the brewing process of this situation must be urgently explained to our bandit suppression soldiers and military officers across the nation. It has been known for a long time that Chen Mingshu organized the Social Democratic Party, attempting to use the power of the Nineteenth Route Army to rebel against the Central Government. Since last year, while serving as Minister of Communications, he signed the Mackay Telecoms contract and the China Merchants Group property transfer agreement, receiving heavy bribes, which was criticized by public opinion. Uncomfortable in his position, he left the country to travel in Europe and then returned to Hong Kong, travelling between Fuzhou and Zhangzhou. His treasonous plot became more urgent. He deeply colluded with the Third Party, and with the mediation of that party's leaders, Huang Qixiang and Xu Qian, he planned to cooperate with the Communist bandits. Messengers traveled back and forth frequently. Recently, a mutual non-aggression agreement has been reached, and an agreement has been reached on providing assistance to the bandit areas and military mutual assistance. Upon hearing the bad news, Zhongzheng feared that they would stray onto the wrong path and thought of their previous service. At the beginning of Chen and others' arrival in Fujian, he sent two telegrams of advice, hoping to curb the rebellious plot. Chairman Lin in Fujian also gave earnest warnings. However, Chen and others failed to recognize their errors and went their own way. Therefore, on the 20th, the puppet People's Provisional Congress and the so-called People's Revolutionary Government, which was opened by Huang Qixiang, Fang Zhenwu, and others as the presidium, appeared in Fuzhou. Li Jishen was the chairman of the puppet government, and Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, Chen Youren, Xu Xiqing, and Zhang Bojun were appointed as chairmen of the administrative, military, foreign affairs, financial, and educational committees of the puppet government, respectively. Huang Qixiang was the chief of staff. The armies were renamed the People's Revolutionary Army. It was announced that the Kuomintang would be abolished, and a flag with a blue top and a red bottom with a yellow five-pointed star in the middle would be used as the flag emblem, abolishing the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. They shouted slogans such as "Alliance with Russia, Alliance with the Communists, Implement Agricultural and Industrial Policies, and Down with the Chinese Kuomintang." They combined elements of the Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, the Nationalist Party, and the Communist Party, melting them into one furnace and forming another party, named the Production Party. Gathering snakes, centipedes, and scorpions into one nest, it is full of contradictions and complexities and cannot be investigated. Although how the future will change is unpredictable, it is clear that they are destroying the Party and harming the country, using resistance to Japan to compromise with Japan, and using bandit suppression to cooperate with the Communist Party. Zhongzheng is truly insufficient to move people and lacks the talent to quell the chaos. The occurrence of this strange event is extremely distressing. The Nineteenth Route Army has followed the revolution and fought in the north and south for many years. Now they are trapped in an extremely dangerous and difficult environment, held hostage by a few ambitious troublemakers, and unable to extricate themselves. We are particularly concerned about them. However, what is clear about the current situation is that Chen Mingshu and others have used unscrupulous means, daring to collude with the Communist Party and destroy the Party in order to achieve their goals. Their personal character is bankrupt and their credibility is in ruins. Even those who have been on the same political path as them have suddenly become suspicious and unwilling to participate in the chaos. The pro- and anti- factions within the Nineteenth Route Army are fighting fiercely. The people of Fujian Province are especially distressed and wish to perish with them. Their overthrow is just a matter of time. Zhongzheng will abide by the Central Government's strategy, do his best, and find ways to eliminate and suppress them. He firmly believes that in the shortest period of time, he will be able to clear everything up, disintegrate this complex and contradictory group, restore the military and people in Fujian to normalcy, and save them from fire and water. All our bandit suppression troops should know the importance of their responsibilities, adhere to the original plan, and attack as usual. Not only should they not have any doubts due to the Fujian Incident, but they should also be even more inspired by the Fujian Incident. The Fujian Incident is the last struggle of the Communist bandits and is their predetermined strategy to undermine our army's five encirclement and suppression campaigns. The actions of Chen Mingshu and others are nothing more than the dying afterglow of the Communist bandits. They are absolutely not enough to shake our policy of bandit suppression. We should strive even harder and aim for final victory. Military officers in all localities should remain calm and maintain order to stabilize the local society. The rumors and different opinions are specifically telegraphed to you. I hope you will tell your subordinates to understand the truth, have insight into good strategies, and be loyal to your duties. It is hoped that Chiang Kai-shek Yanyuan (secret seal of Jiangxi). (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chiang will issue a public telegram on the Fujian incident, suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the Red Army to uphold justice and save the country from danger. The draft is expected to be completed tomorrow. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Summoned to Arrive in Beijing, Discusses Thoughts on the Fujian Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Hubei Chairman Zhang Qun, upon being summoned by Premier Wang via telegram to report to the Central Government and seek instructions regarding the political and financial situation in Hubei Province, arrived in Beijing at the Shen hour [3-5 PM] on the 23rd and lodged at the Lizhi Society. He met with Premier Wang at 6:00 PM, and will see Chairman Lin again on the morning of the 24th. He will stay in Beijing for several days before departing for Shanghai. Zhang stated that Hubei Province had suffered greatly from the Communist bandits in the past, resulting in a devastated rural area. In recent years, under the supervision of Chairman Chiang, his troops have been diligently encircling and suppressing the bandits, and most of the Communist bandits in Hubei Province have been eliminated. Except for a portion of He Long's troops, who were pursued by the Central Army and have fled to Sichuan Province, only about 1,000 Communist bandits under Xia Xi are still operating in western Hubei. The rest can be said to have been completely eliminated. As for the Jing bandits who fled to the Wanxian area of Sichuan, it is said that the Sichuan army is vigorously suppressing them, and the situation is satisfactory. As for the issue of consolidation and suppression, if there are no unexpected restraints at this time, it is expected that they can be cleared up in the shortest period of time. My mission to Beijing is to discuss with the Central Government about the aftermath in the bandit areas, such as the recovery of the rural areas, the accommodation of refugees, the transformation of young people, and the urgent work of implementing education in the bandit areas. All of these require funding. This time, I have come to request the government to allocate funds. When I arrived in Hankou the other day, I saw in the newspapers about the Fujian situation, the Fujian side's declaration, and the Central Government's strict orders for handling it. I have been unable to receive telegrams from the Central Government due to being trapped on the ship for days, so I am not very clear about the recent situation in Fujian. The Fujian side has disregarded the overall situation and committed a great injustice against the world, which truly makes it difficult to find a way out for our country's future. It is painful to speak of it. In terms of foreign relations, Japan has repeatedly accused us of being an unorganized and disunited country. Our country has sternly denied this, but the Fujian side has now done this, which seems to be exposing our nation's weaknesses and giving the international community a pretext. In terms of bandit suppression, the Central Government believes that the Communist bandits not only harm the country, but also undermine the nation, affecting the policy of internal stability and external resistance. It has been working hard to suppress the bandits for years, sacrificing countless lives and property, hoping to eliminate the Communist bandits. However, the Fujian side has abandoned its past achievements in participating in bandit suppression, and is now compromising with the Communist bandits, inciting the agricultural and industrial classes, and organizing a people's government, which is a variation of the Communist government. What are they thinking by destroying the Central Government's previous achievements in bandit suppression and revolutionizing the people's lives? In terms of law, the Covenant Law enacted by the National Assembly the previous year is the public will of the people of the whole country. Now Fujian is disregarding the public will of the people and tearing up the Covenant Law, and is organizing its so-called people's revolutionary government. I do not know how they will explain themselves. I still hope that the Central Government will decide on measures to deal with it. (23rd)</p>

<h3>Commentary: How to Make Individual Emotions Rational</h3>
<p>The Fujian Incident erupted suddenly, shocking the entire country. Foreign aggression is pressing, and internal strife has broken out again. It is like a body riddled with ailments encountering unexpected misfortune, or like a boat in the midst of turbulent waves suddenly experiencing infighting among its passengers. The perilousness of the situation need not be further elaborated. No matter how grand the justification or how upright the cause claimed by Fujian, it cannot excuse itself before the nation. Given the perilous circumstances of today, all military personnel should unite to defend the country against foreign enemies. Even if past grievances remain unresolved, they should be tolerated for the time being. How can they, driven by petty anger, disrupt the war effort, and turn soldiers who have contributed to resisting the enemy into pawns in fratricidal conflict? Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others are not without intellect; surely they understand this principle. But they are so blinded by emotion that they are willing to perpetrate this injustice.</p>
<p>I have often considered this: the people of our country often speak grandly of emotions and uphold their egos, prioritizing the individual over the collective. This results in a narrow-minded and selfish mentality, forming cliques and attacking dissenters. Even the virtuous are not immune, and deceiving the ruler is a common tactic of the petty. Consequently, interests become unbalanced, and standards of right and wrong become blurred. This phenomenon is not only a common ailment recognized by people today but also a historically ingrained concept. Committing crimes and seeking revenge for even the smallest slight was used by Sima Qian to describe wandering knights, while usurping authority and rejecting remonstrance was used by Sima Guang to criticize Wang Anshi. Even figures like Sima Qian and Sima Guang, renowned as virtuous and insightful, could not avoid confusing right and wrong when indulging in their own opinions. Thus, the harm caused by emotional blindness is evident. In recent times, people's hearts have become increasingly fickle and deceitful, focusing solely on expressing individuality while disregarding reason and principles. They prefer to follow the status quo rather than embrace reform in all social phenomena; they prioritize personal connections over competence in the advancement and retreat of talent; and they prioritize private interests over public good in all endeavors. A single disagreement leads to thoughts of sabotage; a single exclusion leads to slander. Some even resort to unscrupulous means, disregarding consequences, ignoring the overall situation, and disregarding public opinion, recklessly indulging their personal emotions. Is this not clearly exemplified by the frequent outbreaks of internal wars, often instigated by impulsive emotions?</p>
<p>Emotions arise from sensory responses, and even slight stimulation can easily lead to rash decisions. To control them properly, reason should be used as a regulator. We are usually misled by emotions, unaware of introspection, causing stagnation in progress and the ruin of national affairs. The way to correct this is for everyone to restrain their emotions, abandon their egos, discard rigid preconceptions, and adhere to law and reason. Let us not sacrifice the whole for petty gains, nor harm great plans for petty grievances. Once the distinction between emotion and reason is clear, the analysis of interests will naturally become evident. Internally, we should promote the righteousness of selflessness and public service, and externally, we should eliminate the destructive and harmful elements that ruin the country. The turning point may lie in this. I dare to use the Fujian Incident to restate these principles, hoping that all concerned people in the world will take it to heart.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Chairman Shao Lizi Arrives in Beijing Yesterday to Discuss Northwestern Construction and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shaanxi Chairman Shao Lizi arrived in Beijing on the 23rd, accompanied by his wife and staff member Zhang Gengtian, after departing from Shaanxi. According to him, on the 17th, he received a telegram from the Standing Committee members Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen of the Economic Committee, inquiring about the Northwestern Construction Plan and requesting him to personally come to Beijing to participate in discussions. Having been in Shaanxi for five months, he felt the need to report to the Central Government, so he telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting a two-week leave. He departed from Xi'an on the 21st to return to Beijing. During his absence from Shaanxi, Chief Secretary Hu Yuwei will act on his behalf for routine provincial government affairs, while Secretary-General Geng will handle daily matters. All sectors in Shaanxi are currently able to cooperate responsibly, and government affairs will proceed as usual. He has consistently advocated for focusing on transportation and water conservancy in Northwestern construction. He has repeatedly suggested to the Central Government the establishment of a Northwestern Construction and Relief Committee, with Mr. Song Ziwen as the chairman. He has heard that the Economic Committee has decided to establish a Northwestern Office. Other aspects of the construction scope and procedures can be decided at leisure and planned by specialists. He still holds this view. In terms of transportation, completing and extending the Longhai Railway is most important for the overall Northwest. For Shaanxi Province, the southern and northern Shaanxi highways are both extremely important. In terms of water conservancy, the Jing River, Wei River, and other rivers have been neglected for years. The severe floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei this year are also due to this. Shaanxi Province is planning to divert water, and construction has already begun, but the financial resources are insufficient. He still hopes for subsidies from the Central Government. Shaanxi has been suffering from drought for five consecutive years. This spring brought rain, but black frost caused damage, resulting in a near-zero wheat harvest. During the summer, floods occurred in the Jing River, Wei River, and Luo River basins. Since arriving in Shaanxi, he has received 30,000 yuan in emergency relief funds from the Central Party Headquarters, 40,000 yuan from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and 150,000 yuan from the Yellow River Flood Relief Association, all of which have been distributed by the Provincial Relief Committee. The Yellow River Relief Association funds were initially disbursed by the province with 300,000 yuan after receiving a telegram from President Wang Jingwei. He did his best to comply, managing to disburse 200,000 yuan to carry out emergency relief in the most severely affected counties and distribute seeds. This was particularly beneficial as it was time for sowing wheat. He now urgently hopes for continued assistance. Since autumn, the rainfall has been very good, and the autumn harvest is averaging about 50-60%. After prolonged disaster, the farmers are very happy to have this, and much winter wheat has been sown. The disaster situation has indeed improved. However, as many able-bodied men have died or fled, many deserted lands remain, and there is a lack of farming tools and livestock, missing opportunities. Winter relief this year is still extremely important, and he hopes that all parties will provide financial assistance. Furthermore, many refugees fleeing the Red scourge in northern Sichuan have arrived in southern Hanzhong, and their situation is dire. He received a telegram from Commander Sun Weir, requesting relief. He immediately proposed it at a provincial government meeting, deciding to allocate 10,000 yuan from the Finance Department. However, with so many refugees, relief is difficult, and he has no choice but to hope that the Central Government and all sectors will provide generous assistance. When he left Xi'an on the morning of the 21st, he learned that Chen Mingshu and others had rebelled. He spoke with Director Yang Hucheng, who was deeply saddened by their actions, benefiting only the enemy and the Red bandits, and expected them to bring about their own destruction. They agreed to jointly telegraph the Central Government, requesting an immediate order for suppression. Chen and others had not sent anyone to Shaanxi to engage in activities beforehand, likely because they knew that Director Yang and others were loyal to the Party and the country and would not be swayed by their instigation. He can confidently say that the Fujian Incident will have no impact on the Northwest. He plans to visit President Wang Jingwei today, and tentatively plans to go to Shanghai by evening train. However, due to private matters, he may have to delay for a few days before visiting Song Ziwen. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Inner Mongolia Autonomy Issue: Qin Dechun Arrives in Beiping from Suiyuan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wu Heling previously accompanied Huang Shaoxiong to Bailingmiao to assist in handling Mongolian affairs. It was planned that he would return to Beijing with Huang to discuss the detailed organization, system, and authority of the Mongolian autonomous government. He recently received urgent telegrams from the Beijing office, urging him to return. Wu telegraphed to Beiping today, deciding to leave Suiyuan on the 24th and get off at Zhangjiakou to discuss the autonomy issue with the Chahar provincial government and Chahar subordinates. He will stay in Zhangjiakou for one day before coming to Beiping to return to Beijing. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun went to Suiyuan to meet with Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Daiwen, Fu Zuoyi, and others to discuss Inner Mongolian autonomy. After the matter was completed, he arrived in Beiping this afternoon to report to Song Zheyuan. According to him, after Huang Shaoxiong went to Bailingmiao, the results of the meeting with the various princes were that the princes had raised two demands: 1. Establish a High-Level Mongolian Autonomous Committee; 2. Establish a local autonomous government and be directly subordinate to the Executive Yuan. Huang Shaoxiong agreed at the time to immediately forward the second request to the Central Government for approval. At the same time, he telegraphed Qin, asking to solicit the opinions of Chahar Province. After Qin Dechun arrived in Suiyuan, he quickly prepared a written opinion and presented it to Huang Shaoxiong. The first autonomous region included the Xilin Gol League and various banners of the Chahar Department, and the second region included the Ulanqab League, the Ikh Zhao League, and the Tumed, Alxa, and Ejin banners. When Qin Dechun met with Huang Shaoxiong, he stated two opinions: 1. Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces are important border areas. After the establishment of the Mongolian autonomous government, the relationship with the Chahar and Suiyuan provincial governments should not be severed to avoid losing contact. 2. The Mongolian banner lands in Chahar Province that have established county administrations have long been affiliated with the county administrations. The local situation is already equal to that of all county administrations, and the number of Han residents in these areas far exceeds the number of Mongols. If these areas are returned to the jurisdiction of the Mongolian banners, it will be incompatible with the customs, habits, and administration. The general managers of the various banners in Chahar Province are now mostly in Zhangjiakou and have expressed opposition to the establishment of an autonomous government, which also shows a glimpse of public opinion. Huang Shaoxiong also agreed to forward these opinions to the Central Government for review and approval. Huang Shaoxiong is expected to return to Beiping in about a week. The Han-Mongolian Joint Celebration will be held in Suiyuan on the 27th. Qin Dechun came to Beiping to report to Song Zheyuan on his visit to Suiyuan and the recent situation in Chahar Province.

<h3>North China Military Expenses: Song Zheyuan Visits He Yingqin and Huang Fu to Negotiate Funding</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The North China military expenses, including the official military salaries, amount to 4,520,000 yuan, plus 445,000 yuan for miscellaneous military salaries in Chahar Province, totaling 4,965,000 yuan. Originally, the three parties—the Hebei and Chahar provincial governments and the Beiping municipal government—monthly disbursed 850,000 yuan, and the Beiping-Liaoning and Beiping-Suiyuan Railways and the Tianjin municipal government jointly disbursed 210,000 yuan. The Central Government provided an additional 3,500,000 yuan monthly. Since the Great Wall War, North China has been in financial difficulty, and the provincial and municipal governments have been unable to disburse their share. The monthly salaries rely solely on the Central Government's 3,500,000 yuan to cope. As of August, the Central and local governments jointly owed the Military Affairs Commission 8,210,000 yuan. During the regular meeting of the Military Affairs Commission yesterday, the members had a lengthy discussion on the military expenses issue. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that he had already visited He Yingqin and Huang Fu separately. The Military Affairs Commission discussed the North China military funding yesterday and decided to maintain the 4,500,000 yuan from the Zhang Xueliang era. Chahar Province has financial difficulties after the war and can hardly afford the monthly funding of 300,000 yuan. It can barely manage to disburse 100,000 yuan each month. The Chahar bandit leader was captured and executed by Zhao Chengshou's troops, and the area has been pacified. The infighting between Tang Yulin and Liu Guitang has stopped. Tang's troops have been transferred to the Zhangbei area, while Liu's troops are still stationed in the Chicheng area and other places. He himself has back pain and is continuing to receive treatment in Beiping. The date of his return to Chahar is still undecided. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Shandong Flood Disaster Not Yet Over; Shouzhang and Yanggu are Still Under Water</h3>
<p>(Jinan) This year, the Yellow River breached its banks in Hebei and Henan, flooding more than 20 counties in western Shandong. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in recent decades.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices in Nanjing: Having read in the newspaper that Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others in Fujian have colluded with reactionary elements, violated public opinion, and established a "People's Government," betraying the Party and the nation, a heinous crime. It is known that Fujian Province is barren and the people are poor, and has repeatedly suffered at the hands of the communist bandits. Nine out of ten homes are empty. The Central Government, out of consideration for the people's hardship, specially ordered the 19th Route Army to enter Fujian last year, originally hoping to save the people from fire and water. Now they have gone against the trend and plunged Fujian Province into eternal damnation. This unexpected event is extremely hateful. For the sake of the Party and the country, and for the safety of our homeland, this association hereby telegraphs the Central Government to punish them severely in order to uphold Party discipline. Fujian fellow villagers in Beijing respectfully request.</p>

<h3>Qian Xiaowu, Manager of the Nantong Wushan Daily</h3>
<p>Emergency Announcement to All Sectors of the Nation's Party, Government, Business, Academic, Military, Police, and Journalism Communities, Fathers, Elders, Brothers, and Sisters Regarding the Illegal Seizure and Sealing of the Wushan Daily by the County Party Headquarters Together with Military and Police Forces: This newspaper was founded on February 1st of the 20th year of the Republic, having already complied with the publication law by submitting reports to the County Party Headquarters and the County Government, which were then forwarded to the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, receiving registration certificates. Since its founding, it has consistently submitted each day's published newspaper to the Central Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Interior, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the County Prosecutor's Office for review. The accuracy of its reporting and the fairness of its arguments are attested to by each day's published newspaper. Thus, for three years since its founding, its reputation has grown and its circulation has expanded, gaining the trust of the entire county's population. Even outside the county, in the capital and the ports of Zhenjiang and Shanghai, as well as in neighboring counties north of the Yangtze River, it has enjoyed circulation and garnered praise. It has never received any reprimands or warnings from the aforementioned reviewing agencies. However, on the 15th of this month, an article was published revealing the inside story of the "Tiande Clothing Store Fined for Trafficking Enemy Goods" case, accurately reporting that the Tiande store owner, Chen Jieting, had publicly declared to the members of the National Salvation Association, including Chen Changgeng, that he had given the funds to Wu Jianzhang, a member of the County Party Headquarters, to handle the matter. On that day, in front of the Tiande store, besides the store's staff, the staff of the National Salvation Association, and this newspaper's editor Tang Yin and reporter Wang Shixiang, there were two or three hundred onlookers, whose names are known and unknown, who heard it firsthand, without any error. Unexpectedly, Wu Jianzhang became enraged out of shame and, colluding with other members, used a fabricated county government order on the morning of the 18th to order the County Public Security Bureau and the County Police Force to lead numerous soldiers and police officers, armed to the teeth, to conduct a large-scale search of this newspaper's office, lasting two or three hours. They took away all the remaining copies of this newspaper and then ordered the Public Security Bureau to seal up this newspaper without authorization. At that time, I, Xiaowu, happened to have gone to the countryside two days prior due to an errand. Although County Magistrate Cheng, upon hearing the news, urgently tried to stop the sealing with a phone call, it was ineffective. Given the usual behavior of the current members of the Nantong County Party Headquarters and this newspaper's consistent adherence to impartiality and integrity, this sealing can truly be considered an honor. However, I do not know which laws or regulations the members relied on to arbitrarily lead military and police forces to seal up this newspaper. According to the personnel who came, they claimed that this newspaper's arguments were absurd, slandered the Party, fabricated facts, and harbored intentional reactionary sentiments. I truly do not know what slanderous remarks against the Party this newspaper made, what intentional reactionary facts it harbored, nor do I know which laws or regulations the County Public Security Bureau and the County Police Force relied on to seal up this newspaper without waiting for an order from the County Government, relying only on the summons of the County Party Headquarters, even ignoring County Magistrate Cheng's attempts to stop it. If such illegal actions are allowed to run rampant, what use is the publication law? What benefit is there to the Central Government's repeated declarations to protect the news industry? Not only is every member of our journalism community in danger, but if they are allowed to control us, no matter how evil they are, our journalism community will not be able to publish a single word about it, and they will become even more unscrupulous, and the glory of our Party and nation created by our Premier will be tarnished and corrupted by these few Party members. The 1.3 million people of Nantong will also be deceived, oppressed, and trampled upon by these few Party members, leaving nothing behind. Looking ahead, I cannot help but shudder. Besides having telegraphed the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government on the 18th and having petitioned the County Government nearby for relief, I hereby respectfully announce the circumstances of the illegal sealing to all sectors of the nation's Party, Government, Business, Academic, Military, Police, and Journalism Communities, Fathers, Elders, Brothers, and Sisters, requesting your observation and assistance in upholding justice. As for the various evil deeds they have committed in the past, that is another matter, and I will collect the facts, gather the evidence, and file charges separately. This is no further clarification. 9297 Special.</p>
<h3>Hitler Comments on European Political Situation: Saar Problem Solved, France and Germany Can Live in Peace; Room for Gradual Achievement of Equal Rights; Does Not Wish to Return to the League of Nations, Willing to Negotiate with All Countries</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, German Chancellor Hitler met with Mr. Blanc, the political editor-in-chief of the Paris News, to discuss European international politics. Mr. Blanc later published Hitler's talks in the News and the Paris Morning News. Hitler stated that there were no major disputes between Germany and France that could lead to war between the two countries, and that after the Saar problem was resolved in the future, the two countries could live in peace. Blanc then raised the issue of Alsace-Lorraine. Hitler immediately solemnly declared that Germany had definitively renounced its sovereignty over the Alsace-Lorraine region, and that Germany had no further ambition to annex neighboring territories. Hitler then discussed the situation between Germany and Poland. Hitler praised the patriotism of the Polish people, but stated that Germany also had its reasons for maintaining its original customs. The disputes between Germany and Poland were all due to the poor handling of the Treaty of Paris, which created them, but there were no major disputes that would lead to bloodshed, and there were already signs of rapprochement between the two countries, and it was expected that a friendly treaty would be concluded soon. Hitler reiterated his desire for peace, stating that if European countries fought among themselves, the Bolsheviks would take advantage of the conflict and gain the fisherman's benefit, and in the future Europe might be controlled by Asian powers. Because the war clouds in Asia are urgent, it is not yet known who will win. Therefore, the European powers today should urgently renew their policies, focusing on long-term goals, and the reason why he personally wants to restore Germany's glory is actually a claim on the conscience of tens of millions of people, with no ambition to invade foreign countries, and Germany, struggling with poverty, has no spare time to prepare for war. Mr. Blanc then asked Hitler whether there was any possibility of Germany and France joining hands. Hitler said that this matter depends on the will of France. If France insists that its guaranteed security lies in Germany's weakness, then there is no possibility of rapprochement between the two countries, because the era of this kind of thinking no longer exists today. If France can recognize the possibility of reconciliation and is willing to start negotiations with Germany, then he is willing to listen to everything, consider everything, and bear everything. As for what Germany requires in terms of equal interests, it is easy to explain. In terms of morality, it is equal sovereignty, but in practical terms, there is room for gradual achievement of goals, but if Germany is given equal status, and Germany must first give a price of concession, then he wants to hear what France needs as the price of equal rights, and what France calls guarantee. Hitler said at the end that Germany does not want to return to Geneva, because the League of Nations has become an international parliament, and the countries are in it, vying with each other, which is not only insufficient to dispel misunderstandings, but also enough to increase them. However, Germany is especially willing to open negotiations with any other government. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Countries Begin Diplomatic Negotiations on Arms Reduction; Avenol Active in Rome; Henderson Still Plans to Resign</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference has entered a period of secret negotiations starting today. Whether the technical talks in Geneva should continue will be decided by Henderson. At the ten-minute Steering Committee meeting this afternoon, Henderson suggested a two-month recess, stating that the representatives of the four major powers had reached a consensus that the highest efforts should be made to conclude a convention. The four major powers suggested that the General Committee, originally scheduled to convene on December 4, does not seem convenient to convene as scheduled, because there are several important political issues that are considered too important, and if they are discussed before the appropriate time, it is feared that the results may not be smooth. Therefore, it is recommended that the General Committee be postponed until the League of Nations Executive Council meeting in January or after the meeting, and then convened. At this time, the work of the conference is best supplemented by the countries using diplomatic organs as much as possible to help its success. It is also heard from reliable sources that Henderson told the representatives of the major powers after the Steering Committee closed that during this period of secret negotiations, he would be in the position of an observer and would not be responsible for success or failure. It is also heard that Henderson plans to resign as Chairman of the Disarmament Conference on January 15, when the League of Nations Executive Council meets. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Striving to Promote Trade with China; Criticism of Roosevelt's Monetary Policy Intensifies; Industrial and Commercial Control Plan Will Be More Stringent; Sprague's Resignation Attracts Attention from All Sides</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to reports from here, if the US government and Congress adopt any silver plan in the future, they will still take trade with China as the main motivation. Silver experts here are currently carefully studying whether the increase in silver prices is beneficial to exports to China. Leaders of the silver faction inside and outside Congress have stated that if the value of China's currency can be closer to the value of the US currency, China's purchasing power will be greatly increased, China's imports will be greatly stimulated, and the US industry and commerce will also benefit greatly. However, those who generally oppose raising silver prices claim that the international use of silver is only one way to solve the trade deficit, and its price fluctuations will not have a great impact on the trend of trade. In order to determine the correctness of the views of the two factions, general trade and silver experts are studying various factors. According to a statistic made at this time, since the beginning of this year, the exchange rate of silver against the US dollar has increased by 50%, and US exports to China have also increased, but the ratio is not equal.

<p>(Washington) According to officials here today, the current purpose of the National Recovery Administration is to militarize the national industry. The plan is to tighten the federal government's control over industry and commerce to an extent that is beyond the imagination of the general public. Officials here also want to compare the new plan of the Recovery Administration with the current one of Mussolini in Italy. It is heard that the content is based on the recent investigation and classification of industry and commerce, and the national industry will be organized into 325 groups. Each group must operate in accordance with the industry regulations drafted by the government. These industry regulations will be more stringent than the current voluntary industry regulations, because the Industrial Recovery Administration has only been established for six months, and many difficulties have been felt in the implementation of industry regulations, so a stricter plan is planned to force various industries to comply. Today, the establishment of the Supreme Committee by the US government to supervise and comprehensively adjust foreign policy and commercial policy is generally regarded as a supplement to the planned plans of the Recovery Administration.

<p>(Washington) Acting Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that the Treasury Department is currently maintaining the nearly depreciated US government bonds in the market. Funds from government agencies such as the Postal Savings Bureau, the Rural Loan Office Debt Repayment Reserve Fund, and the Central Deposit Insurance Office will be handed over to the Treasury Department for government investment. The amount of funds that the government can obtain has not yet been announced, but the amount used for investment will be announced every week. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) After the Disarmament Conference adjourned to January 15 of next year, when the League of Nations Executive Council holds a meeting, it is now preparing to conduct diplomatic negotiations during the recess period in order to reduce the political differences of the powers. The Steering Committee held a closed meeting this afternoon and accepted Henderson's suggestion that the two technical committees should continue to work without discussion. Therefore, Henderson will cooperate with the Disarmament Conference staff to decide the schedule of the two committees' work in Geneva. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, French Foreign Minister Pang Gu and the heads of other delegations returned to their countries separately. The period of Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson's residence in Geneva will not exceed ten days, but the various specialized committees will continue to work. Although the degree of participation of various countries in this work will vary, at least the principle that the technical work of the Disarmament Conference will continue uninterrupted has been maintained, which is the firm advocacy of the French representative. In addition, Pang Gu also achieved other results: (1) Britain intended to abandon the basis for discussion decided on October 14, and after Pang Gu's mediation, Britain no longer intends to do so. (2) It was rumored that a kind of peace conference would be convened outside Geneva, and this statement was also opposed by Pang Gu and disappeared. (3) Pang Gu also held talks with representatives of Britain, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Austria, the content of which was to prepare for the future of the situation, and was not limited to the disarmament issue. Polish representative Leski also met with Soviet representative to France Ambassador Tao Fuga Leiski, and both sides believed that Russia and Poland had completely consistent views on the serious issues of the European political situation.

<p>Whether the US government in Hot Springs should continue to purchase gold policy issues will probably depend on tomorrow's meeting between the US President and Acting Treasury Secretary Morgen. At present, Strong Johnson, Director of the Restoration Administration, Interior Secretary Ikes, and National Relief Director Hawkins have all arrived in Hot Springs, and important meetings are expected. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Recently, it was learned in Hot Springs that the US President did not feel annoyed by the resignation letter of the Treasury Department's monetary advisor, Sprague, because this matter had been in mind for a long time. It is said that since Mr. Sprague returned from attending the Economic Conference, he has been scattered and no longer trusted by the President. The US President seems completely satisfied with the progress of his monetary policy under the guidance of Acting Foreign Minister Morgenthau and Financial Relief Corporation CEO Jones, so he expressed that he is now turning his attention to the whole country. Revival Administration Supervisor Johnson will come here on Friday to discuss the entire revival plan with the President. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, US Treasury Secretary Wu Ding issued a comment, severely criticizing the words in the resignation letter of Treasury Department monetary advisor Sprague yesterday, and especially attacked Mr. Sprague's claim that the United States must borrow 200 billion yuan from the people with unstable guarantees, saying that Mr. Sprague pointed out that US government bonds were unstable guarantees, which would damage his common sense and qualifications. Mr. Sprague once served as a general consultant to the Bank of England and was an internationally renowned currency expert, but allowed personal emotions to confuse his judgment and agitate his emotions. Commentators believe that this statement shows that Mr. Sprague not only disagrees with Roosevelt's policies, but also disagrees with the more stable faction within the Treasury Department. As for those who have always supported the government's monetary policy, they were all happy to see Wu Ding's comments, because Wu is publicly recognized as the leader of the Treasury Department's stable faction. This statement shows that he at least has some sympathy for the White House's policies, so it is expected that the US government's prestige in the stable financial faction will also increase a lot.

<h3>American Woman Commits Suicide by Airplane for Her Husband</h3>
<p>In Jacksonville, Florida, there was an aviator named Tingdong who died in an accident two weeks ago while riding in a car. His wife was extremely sad, so she borrowed an airplane today, stored four hours of gasoline in it, and flew eastward over the Atlantic Ocean, leaving a letter of suicide, roughly saying, "I will never return, I wish to die in the air, to see the truth." Three pilots have already taken planes to search for her. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Wall Street's view that Professor Sprague's resignation will not necessarily affect the government's gold policy is indeed well-founded. It is heard that President Luo is now carrying out his plan with Acting Treasury Secretary Morganthau in earnest. The main securities fluctuated uncertainly today, with a rather narrow range, while government bonds were very weak. The US dollar has not plunged wildly in the foreign exchange market for the time being, and general trading is very quiet. Brokers believe that the government has taken measures to stabilize the market. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The resignation of Professor Sprague, advisor to the US Treasury Department, has aroused great attention from people here, because Professor Li Shi was previously related to the Bank of England and is a representative of the stable currency faction. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt will pursue monetary policies that completely disregard its impact elsewhere in the world. The final result will be that the gold countries are forced to abandon the gold standard and join the countries that use the gold pound, such as Britain. After the gold countries abandon the gold standard, there may be a way to convene a new currency conference. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Shihe Insurance Company is now offering a price of 30 to 40 per 100 for insurance operations to prevent France from abandoning the gold standard at the end of December this year. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

Now for Mr. Shi's comments on the economy's reply: (1) Prices have already increased, (2) The experiences of other countries are also the same. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

<p>Warburg, a former economic advisor to the U.S. delegation attending the London World Economic Conference and known as a close confidant of President Roosevelt, spoke publicly today, sharply criticizing President Roosevelt's monetary policy. Warburg denounced the idea of controlled inflation, stating that inflation cannot be controlled; once it expands, it will inevitably exceed the scope of control. Furthermore, there can be no such thing as a currency with a constant purchasing power. The generally silent majority of people should inform President Roosevelt that the American people are prepared to cope with everything in a gradual and orderly recovery process. The audience, consisting of figures from American political and academic circles, was surprised to hear Warburg criticize President Roosevelt's policies. Warburg also mentioned President Roosevelt's message to the World Economic Conference, saying that his responsibility was to carefully study and interpret its meaning, but he ultimately decided that he could not handle this matter. Therefore, he wrote to Secretary of State Hull resigning from his position as financial advisor, but he still acted covertly, hoping to make President Roosevelt aware of the error in continuing his monetary experimentation policy. President Roosevelt is admirable, but a mistaken notion seems to mislead his intentions, and there are too many advisors who disregard the accumulated experience of thousands of years. If human intelligence is not yet capable of managing a simple gold standard, then it is even less capable of handling controlled commodities and the more complex problems of the US dollar. A national monetary system cannot be implemented perfectly unless it is adopted by a majority of other important countries. Most of the countries attending the World Economic Conference clearly wish to establish a modern, improved gold standard. Warburg concluded by saying that prices can only be raised if there is a great deal of profitable business and abundant income; simply raising prices is not advisable. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>After Sprague of Chicago issued his letter of resignation amidst widespread criticism, he has gained an acquaintance, who is none other than Allen, a Chicago economist revered as the leader of the financial circles of the American Midwest. Today, Allen issued a statement, saying that Sprague's call for the nation to pay attention to the fundamental errors of the government's inflationary policy can be considered a great service to the public. The nation must know that weakening the gold standard is precisely weakening, not strengthening, the price structure. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(New York) According to statistics released today by the National Industrial Conference Board, the US national debt has increased by $6,360,000,000 in the past three years, bringing the total to $22,500,000,000. The reason for the increase is decreased tax revenue and increased unexpected expenses. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Acting Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has now rescinded his previous order, allowing Treasury officials to release information to journalists without first obtaining permission from the Secretary or Assistant Secretary.

<h3>Anglo-French Trade War Affects Friendly Relations; British Demand to Abolish French Surcharges Fails</h3>
<p>(London) A trade war between Britain and France threatens to disrupt the friendly relations between the two countries. Britain demands that France abolish the 15% surcharge and 6% landing tax imposed on British goods, otherwise Britain will impose a 20% import tariff on French goods in retaliation. The above measures have been notified today by British Trade Minister Runciman to the French Ambassador to Britain. Former French Finance Minister Flandin, currently visiting Britain as the leader of the French Chamber of Deputies delegation, reportedly met with British Foreign Secretary Simon last night to discuss the matter. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Trade Minister Runciman declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that if France does not abolish the surcharges on British goods as soon as possible, the British government will impose additional taxes on French goods. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Britain's friendly negotiations to persuade France to abolish the surcharges and landing taxes have been ineffective, leading to threats of retaliation. France's import taxes do not apply to American goods, which is somewhat discriminatory against Britain. Furthermore, British trade is also being hit by French tax regulations. This week, the British New Welsh coal industry received news that France was reducing the import quota for foreign coal from 65% to 55%, which will lead to a reduction of 600,000 tons in one area and the unemployment of 4,000 miners. French Finance Minister Bonnet had previously promised to abolish the surcharges, but the pressure from French business circles, especially the cotton textile industry, was so strong that his words were not fulfilled. The British ultimatum will make it even more difficult for French Premier Sarraut to deal with today's questions in the Chamber of Deputies regarding the budget. Many expect the Sarraut cabinet to follow in the footsteps of the Daladier cabinet sooner or later. Many believe that only a dictator can solve the problem, but unfortunately, there seems to be no one qualified to be a dictator at present. Since September 1, France has seen an outflow of gold amounting to £30 million, which is enough to show the instability of the public when the budget is unbalanced. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Litvinov Departs the US; Outstanding Issues Cannot Be Resolved Immediately</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Undersecretary of State Phillips issued a statement today, saying that the U.S. government and Litvinov have not been able to effectively resolve all issues between Russia and the U.S. in this short period of time, and discussions will continue after Litvinov returns to Russia. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, accompanied by Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to the US, Svirsky, visited Undersecretary of State Phillips to bid farewell. The meeting lasted ten minutes. Litvinov is scheduled to depart tomorrow for New York, and will return to Europe by ship from there on Saturday or Sunday. It is generally expected that the State Department will issue a communiqué this evening regarding the debt issues and other disputes between the US and Russia. The final agreement on various issues will only be reached after future negotiations. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

Chen Mingshu was absent due to illness. Guests included Sa Zhenbing and representatives from various agencies and public and commercial organizations, as well as the 464th Regiment of the 322nd Brigade of the 78th Division at the scene. At 9:40 AM, General Commander Qiu Guozhen announced the opening of the meeting. The entire body elected Huang Qixiang, Xu Minghong, Dai Ji, Fang Zhenwu (representative Yao Tanchang), Chen Yaokun, He Gonggan, Liu Jianmi, Zhang Bojun, Peng Yueyu, Mei Gongbin, Li Zhangda, Zhong Xizhuo, Weng Zhaoyuan, Lin Zhifu, Cheng Ximeng, Guan Chupu, Yu Xinqing, and 17 others as the Presidium. The Presidium then mutually elected Huang Qixiang as the Chairman. Huang delivered the opening address. After Huang finished speaking, Sa Zhenbing, Li Jishen, Yu Xinqing, Chen Youren, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Yao Tichang, Dai Ji, Li Zhangda, He Gonggan, Guan Chupu, Weng Zhaoyuan, Xu Qian, Chen Yaokun, Wang Fengqi, and others all gave speeches. After the speeches, Huang Qixiang read out the People's Rights Declaration of the People's Congress. After the reading, they began to discuss proposals and resolutions: (1) China is a democratic republic of the people who produce throughout China. The highest power in China belongs to the National Congress of Representatives of farmers, workers, and those who jointly support the social structure of commerce, academics, and soldiers. (2) China's national independence is the inviolable supreme principle. (3) All people in the country, regardless of race, gender, or occupation, except for those who betray the nation and exploit farmers and workers, have the absolute rights of freedom and equality. (4) Realize the thorough liberation of farmers, workers, and the producing people. (5) Deny all unequal treaties forcibly imposed by imperialists and first realize thorough tariff autonomy.

All proposals were unanimously passed at the scene. Subsequently, the representatives of Fujian and Anhui proposed to establish a People's Revolutionary Government and requested the Presidium to accept it. The Presidium Chairman Huang Qixiang declared that the Congress unconditionally accepted this proposal, read the original proposal, and put it to a vote, which was unanimously approved by a show of hands. Subsequently, Weng Zhaoyuan and Qiu Guozhen unfolded and displayed the flag, which consisted of two horizontal stripes, red on top and blue on the bottom, with a yellow five-pointed star embedded in the middle. Then, a flag-raising ceremony was held, and the entire audience paid their respects to the flag. After the ceremony, the representatives took photos and shouted slogans, and then set off for a parade, starting from the venue, entering the city through South Street, and dispersing at Taijiang. At the same time, the Propaganda Team of the All-Fujian Literature and Art Workers Association organized eight propaganda teams to give open-air speeches in the city and distribute leaflets. Also, when the Congress opened, planes with numbers 68 and 69 scattered the Declaration of People's Rights in the air, and only landed when the meeting ended. All industries and businesses in the city closed that day, and students from all schools also suspended classes for a day because they were informed by the Education Department to participate.</p>
<h3>Content of the Government Organization</h3>
<p>After the so-called People's Representative Presidium accepted the Congress's proposal to form a government, the Presidium convened a meeting at the Pacification Headquarters at 8:00 PM on the 20th. Huang Qixiang, Xu Minghong, Dai Ji, Fang Zhenwu (representative Yao Tichang), He Gonggan, Liu Jianmi, Weng Zhaoyuan, Zhong Xizhuo, Mei Gongbin, Peng Yueyu, Li Zhangda, Cheng Ximeng, Zhang Bojun, Chen Yaokun, Guan Chupu, Yu Xinqing, and 17 others were present, and resolved to accept the People's Representative proposal and establish the People's Revolutionary Government. The number of government members was decided to be 11, but the candidates would only be announced on the morning of the 22nd, but it had been pre-determined that they would be Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Feng Yuxiang, Xu Qian, Fang Zhenwu, Youren, Dai Ji, Li Zhangda, and He Gonggan. The name of the government is the "People's Revolutionary Government of the Republic of China," with its capital in Fuzhou. There was also a proposal to change the 20th of this month to New Year's Day. How to organize the government below the People's Government, although it needs to be discussed and decided when the government is established, it has also been pre-determined that there will be three committees: military, economic, and cultural, which will separately govern diplomacy, agriculture and industry, internal affairs, transportation, finance, etc. For the local system, it has been decided to adopt the provincial governor system. It is said that Fujian province will be divided into three provinces: Central Fujian, Southern Fujian, and Northern Fujian, or Southern Fujian and Northern Fujian. There is also a saying that Sa Zhenbing and He Gonggan will be appointed as provincial governors.</p>
<h3>Taking Over the National Tax Agencies</h3>
<p>Starting in the afternoon of the 20th, all original agencies were closed down, awaiting transfer by Construction Department Head Sun Xiwena and Salt Transport Envoy Lu Wenlan, who were escorted out of Fujian, when the so-called new government was established. Provincial Committee Member Gao Dengting also reportedly fled upon hearing the news. His residence in Huang Lane was once searched. (It is said that those who went to search were from Northern Fujian). As for Education Director Zheng Zhenwen, he is still in Fujian, attending to duties as usual. The Pacification Headquarters sent Deng Ruiren to be Salt Transport Envoy and Mai Yingjun to be Superintendent of the Fujian Maritime Customs in the afternoon of the 20th, and they took office immediately.</p>
<p>Continuation on Page 7</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>There are rumors that the Construction Department Head has been appointed as Zeng Qian, and the President of the High Court has been appointed as Lin Zhifu, but these rumors have not been confirmed. On the 20th, the Pacification Headquarters ordered all national tax agencies to transfer all income to the Headquarters and sent personnel to withdraw funds. A total of 238,000 yuan was deposited in the Salt Transport Envoy's Office and the Audit Office, all of which were appropriated by the Pacification Headquarters. The new government has decided to implement tariff autonomy and has pushed Chen Youren to draft the autonomy regulations in preparation for implementation. However, the Japanese Consul Moriya visited the French Consul on the 20th, reportedly to discuss preventing the new government from taking over the Customs. As for the attitude towards the new government, it is said that they are temporarily taking a neutral stance. Furthermore, it is reported that the Japanese Consul visited the British and American Consuls separately in the past two days, and the discussion was also about preventing the takeover of the Customs, strongly arguing that they would not give up unless they received a telegram from the Nanjing National Government.</p>
<h3>Li and Chen Telegraph Their Withdrawal from the Party</h3>
<p>Regarding the party issue, it was announced on the spot at the People's Congress that the Kuomintang was abolished. In the afternoon of the same day, the new government further ordered all counties to remove the portraits and wills of Sun Yat-sen. The provincial party headquarters also automatically closed down and telegraphed to persuade Guangdong, Guangxi and Hong Kong to participate. Provincial committee members Chen Yaokun, Wang Huaijin, etc. have sworn to withdraw from the party at the Congress. The Minguo Daily newspaper was also renamed People's Daily on the 21st and moved into the provincial party headquarters. Li Jishen, Li Zhangda, Chen Youren, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, Chen Mingshu, Xu Qian, etc. also issued a telegraph declaring their withdrawal from the Kuomintang. Huang Qixiang also telegraphed yesterday, declaring his withdrawal from the Third Party and working hard for the People's Revolution.</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Renamed</h3>
<p>Above the so-called People's Revolutionary Government is a National People's Congress, with a number of committee members. Under the Congress, there will be committees for mass movement and propaganda. The outline of this organization is currently being drafted. As for military affairs, it is said that the 19th Route Army and the people's self-defense forces of various counties will all be prefixed with the words "People's Revolutionary Army." On the 21st, the Pacification Headquarters convened a military-political meeting, with commanders above the division level in attendance. According to official sources, representatives from the Lu and Liu divisions also participated. The new authorities also recognized the extreme importance of the Zhangxia and Changmen coastal defenses. On the 19th, the Pacification Headquarters sent Yun Yinglin's brigade to take over the defenses of Majiang and Changmen and to take over the strategic port command. Huang Qiang was appointed as the commander of the Zhangxia strategic port. Yun's brigade left for Changmen and Majiang that day to complete the takeover. Huang Qiang also telegraphed on the 20th to announce his assumption of office and stated that the defense area of Xiamen had been completely taken over. Li Mengbin and Mao Zhencai, the commander of the Changmen Fort, led the Jiangzhen, Jiangyuan, and Chuguan ships from Majiang and the Ding'an transport ship out of the Fujian port at 2:00 AM on the 20th. It is said that they were heading to Sandu. However, the Haizao Xingxing No. 2 patrol boats, which had been ordered to patrol the coast some days ago, returned to Mawei on the morning of the 21st and were intercepted by the stationed troops near the Luoxing Pagoda. The naval training camp was disarmed and dismissed by the 19th Route Army on the morning of the 21st. Furthermore, it is reported that the Changmen gunpowder depot and the Haichaosi ammunition depot have been taken over by the 19th Route Army, with more than 2 million rounds of ammunition, hundreds of artillery shells, and more than a thousand rifles. The new authorities have determined a reorganization plan for the Marine Corps in Fujian. On the 21st, the Pacification Headquarters issued an order appointing Yang Tingying as the Commander of the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian and concurrently commander of the First Brigade, and Lin Bingzhou as the Deputy Commander and concurrently commander of the Second Brigade. The various units of the Marine Corps have been concentrating in Sandu in recent days and appear to be preparing to leave Fujian by sea.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the New Government</h3>
<p>The Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Government held its establishment ceremony at the Provincial Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. The list of the 11 Central Committee members is as before, but Feng Yuxiang's name has been changed to Yu Xinqing. Li Jishen was elected as the chairman. The order of ceremony was as follows: (1) Playing music, (2) Firing cannons, (3) Members of the People's Revolutionary Government take their seats, (4) Presidium enters the room, (5) Entire body pays respects to the national flag, (6) Presidium confers seals of office, (7) Chairman announces the reasons for the establishment of the People's Revolutionary Government, (8) Taking oaths, (9) Presidium delivers speeches, (10) Guests deliver speeches, (11) Members of the People's Revolutionary Government give speeches in response, (12) Shouting slogans, (13) Playing music and concluding the ceremony. In the afternoon of the 22nd, the first meeting of the Central Committee was held to discuss major plans. Under the government, it was first decided to establish the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the Military, Economic, and Cultural Committees. Chen Youren also serves concurrently as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jiang Guangnai concurrently serves as the Minister of Finance and the Chairman of the Economic Committee, Li Jishen concurrently serves as the Chairman of the Military Committee, and Chen Mingshu concurrently serves as the Chairman of the Cultural Committee. The Central Government is located in the old Provincial Government building, and the People's Congress is located in the former Provincial Party Headquarters. The office locations of other ministries and committees have not yet been determined. (November 22nd)</p>
<h3>Minimum Program</h3>
<p>The New Voice Agency says that the so-called People's Revolutionary Government of China formally held its establishment ceremony the day before and promulgated the minimum political program of the People's Revolutionary Government of China. The full text is as follows: "Chinese society is a semi-feudal society under the rule of imperialists. The greatest goal of the Chinese revolution is to eliminate the domination of imperialism in China, and at the same time eliminate all feudal forces, in order to establish a government that fully represents the rights of the people, and must immediately implement the following minimum program: (1) Abolish unequal treaties and renegotiate treaties of equal reciprocity with various countries. (2) Foreign-funded and foreign-managed enterprises and cultural undertakings that violate the interests of the Chinese nation may be restricted or confiscated. (3) Consolidate new and old foreign debts; absolutely deny any political loans that harm the country, and conditionally repay others separately. (4) Implement foreign trade controls. (5) Strictly implement absolute tariff autonomy. (6) Open up political power; any counter-revolutionary elements who are attached to imperialism and warlords will not be granted any political rights. (7) All ethnic groups within China are equal and have the freedom to unite in a revolutionary manner to confirm national self-determination. (8) Ensure absolute freedom of person, residence, belief, speech, assembly, association, strike, demonstration, and publication. (9) Implement fair elections. (10) Abolish all exorbitant taxes. (11) Immediately implement 'land to the tiller' and achieve land distribution based on population. Land, forests, mines, and rivers are completely nationalized. (12) Banks and all important transportation enterprises are subject to national control and coordination. (13) Use political power and national capital to support the scientific development of agricultural production. (14) Strictly prohibit usury. (15) Crack down on unscrupulous merchants. The daily necessities of human life are exclusively sold by the state. (16) Formulate labor laws to improve the lives of farmers and workers, and protect and support the development of farmers' and workers' organizations. (17) Vigorously promote universal education. (18) Implement conscription, arm the people, and assist the people's anti-imperialist, economic, and political struggles."</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Establishment of the Puppet Government</h3>
<p>The Far East Agency says that the so-called People's Government organized in Fujian was formally declared established on the 20th and issued a declaration of establishment the next day. The declaration stated, "(1) To seek the liberation of the Chinese nation and complete a truly independent and free country; (2) To establish a government of the producing people; (3) To realize equal rights for all ethnic groups in the country; (4) To protect the absolute freedom and equality of all producing people; (5) To eliminate the forces of imperialism in China, overthrow the warlords, eradicate the feudal system, develop the national economy, and liberate the masses of farmers and workers." The above points are the central tasks of this revolutionary government, and this revolutionary government is determined to make the greatest efforts to realize them. (The rest omitted). The tone is entirely that of the so-called "Production Party" of the Third Party, which can be described as the height of absurdity.</p>
<h3>After the Political Coup in Fujian, the Prospects for Suppressing Bandits are Affected; Bandits Take Advantage to Launch Counter-Offensives in the Dang Kou Area</h3>
<p>A report from Nanchang states that the central government was slightly aware of Chen Mingshu and others' actions during the brewing period. Initially, they planned to separately smooth things out, explain, and seek a compromise in order to heal the rift. The other day, President Wang, responding to Chairman Jiang's telegram invitation, came to Jiangxi with Ye Chucang by plane, with the sole purpose of discussing this matter. At that time, Wang and Jiang still decided to take a calm attitude to deal with it, hoping that they would prioritize national difficulties. However, the facts turned out to be the opposite. After Chen and others arrived in Fuzhou, Jiang still believed that with the progress of bandit suppression and the urgency of military affairs, it was not appropriate to have internal strife again. Therefore, he sent two planes to Fuzhou on the 15th to meet Cai Tingkai and persuade him to understand the big picture and dissuade him. Unexpectedly, after waiting until now, the plane has not returned. It was not until the 20th that it was known that the two planes had been detained, and the state of the rebellion was unfortunately confirmed. According to the truth of the Fujian Incident published here, Chen Mingshu first formed the Social Democratic Party, using the 19th Route Army as its basic military force, and recently colluded with the Third Party to expand its influence. Huang Qixiang, the leader of the Third Party, has also been contacting the Communists, maintaining tacit understanding with the bandit troops in Jiangxi and Fujian. Therefore, the Fuzhou Citizens' Congress on the 20th promoted land revolution, and Huang Qixiang, Peng Zexiang, and others have already reached an agreement with the bandit troops. The wives of Luo Binghui and Peng Dehuai are still staying in Fuzhou, which is most noteworthy.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the political coup in Fujian tacitly agreed with the bandits or not, it has a significant impact on the prospects for bandit suppression. The center of gravity of the bandits is in the contiguous areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces. Joint efforts by the three provinces to suppress the bandits cannot be effective if one is missing. Moreover, one of the main forces of the puppet government is concentrated in the mountainous areas bordering Nanfeng, Nancheng, Lichuan, Zixi in eastern Jiangxi, and Jianning, Ninghua, Guangze, Shaowu, and Chong'an in western Fujian, which cannot be effectively controlled without a two-pronged attack by the Jiangxi and Fujian troops. The other day, Zhu and Mao poured all their efforts into attacking eastern Jiangxi, such as the battles of Xuwant Daxiongguan, etc., where the national army defeated each bandit. However, after the news of the changes in Fujian on the 20th spread, the Red bandits, seeing an opportunity, launched a counter-offensive northward in the Dang Kou area of Nanfeng and Yihuang, which was extremely fierce. However, Chairman Jiang is extremely calm about this and is still advancing according to the original plan. At this moment, the Northern Route Army in eastern Jiangxi has no less than 300,000 men, and they are all elite troops, enough to deal with Zhu and Mao. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Paper Money Run: Authorities Exert Efforts to Maintain Stability, Expected to Subside Within the Day, Simultaneously Restricting Withdrawals to Uphold Finance</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Following the run on Guangdong Provincial Bank's paper money on the 18th, the financial sector inevitably experienced some chaos. Fortunately, the Finance Department issued a notice that the silver coin notes with a face value of ten yuan would be suspended for exchange for one month. This immediately reduced the amount of ten-yuan notes in circulation by over ten million. The run gradually subsided. Therefore, on the 19th and 20th, one-yuan and five-yuan notes were able to circulate in the market. On the 17th and 18th, the Provincial Bank exchanged approximately 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in cash each day. On the 19th, due to sufficient funds, and to facilitate citizens' exchange of cash, the Provincial Bank specially increased two windows for exchange. However, the number of people exchanging notes decreased. As for the suspended ten-yuan notes, those urgently needing them could trade them on the market, at approximately 75% or 76% of their face value. Various institutions holding these ten-yuan notes reported their holdings to higher authorities and exchanged them for circulating paper money. The financial authorities are also actively preparing funds to resume exchange after one month. In addition, there are approximately ten million yuan of one-yuan and five-yuan notes circulating in the market. The Provincial Bank has sufficient funds to back these silver coin notes. These reserves are divided into three types: cash, assets, and tax revenue guarantees. These three items combined constitute a 100% reserve. Compared to various paper currencies issued in the past, this is particularly stable. However, recently, ignorant merchants were alarmed by rumors spread by treacherous individuals. Market monks even took advantage of the Fujian Incident to spread rumors, leading to a discounted run. This is truly the work of fools troubling themselves.</p>
<p>This province's commerce has already shown signs of decline this winter. Exacerbated by the recent paper money run, finance has become even tighter. In order to maintain the market exchange rate, the financial authorities approved the silver industry association's proposal and issued a notice restricting deposits and withdrawals. The method is that for deposits in banks, silver shops, or stores in this city, withdrawals of matured deposits are limited to 20% of the deposit amount per month. The Finance Department also issued a notice urging people to circulate paper money to avoid trapping industry and commerce in difficulty. The notice stated: "It is noted that the Provincial Bank's issuance of provincial currency has been overseen by the chairman and vice-chairman of the supervisory committee organized by merchants and civic groups. The committee manages the 50% reserve fund and the 50% reserve guarantee. The committee also publishes the total amount issued and the amount of reserves twice a month. Representatives of merchant and civic groups attend meetings to check the silver amounts, sign, and stamp as evidence. With such a complete system and solid foundation, the credit has been evident since the issuance. Repeatedly, due to market news, when the silver market supplement (補水) dropped to 4 or 5 yuan per thousand, once the bank association maintained it, it immediately returned to the normal amount of 1 or 2 yuan per thousand supplement fee. However, in the past two months, a type of profiteering transporter deliberately created rumors in the silver market, causing the water price to drop to 4 or 5 yuan. They then bought low-water provincial currency in the silver market and exchanged it for full silver coins at the Provincial Bank, several thousand or tens of thousands each market, twice a day, with dozens of firms rotating. The Provincial Bank's 50% cash reserve has become the object of their profiteering. This department has confirmed this through investigation and had no choice but to issue a serious warning. Unexpectedly, a few days later, coinciding with reports of news from Fujian Province, unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to fabricate various rumors to shake people's hearts. As a result, some people in the market discriminated against provincial currency. In order to stabilize finance, the government was forced to announce on the afternoon of the 18th that the ten-yuan provincial currency would be temporarily suspended for exchange for one month to prevent treacherous elements from succeeding. This was a last resort. The current perilous situation of the silver industry and miscellaneous businesses has reached an extreme point. The Lunar New Year is approaching. If another paper money run occurs, the future of industry and commerce in the city will be unimaginable. At this critical moment, all silver industry, miscellaneous businesses, and stores should accept and circulate one-yuan and five-yuan provincial currency as much as possible. Do not be suspicious and push it out in the silver market or run on the Provincial Bank, which would trap industry and commerce in a dead end. As for those who fabricate rumors and disrupt finance, the government will investigate thoroughly and severely punish them." (November 21)</p>
<h3>Beiping Strictly Prohibits Dancing: Yuan Liang Sends Police to Arrest a Large Number of Dance Hostesses, Each Sentenced to a Fine of Ten Dollars Before Being Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang strictly prohibits dancing. Recently, after capturing a large number of dance hostesses in dance halls, they were transferred to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau by the First District for detention and disposal. After this incident occurred, society paid close attention. However, the large number of dance hostesses has already been released today. The following is a compilation of information from various sources:</p>
<h3>Dance Hostesses in Prison</h3>
<p>After receiving the news, the reporter first went to the Public Security Bureau. Upon arriving at the cell block, the reporter saw interesting words recorded in the cell register. Upon closer inspection, it was "Da Ding sent a cotton quilt and felt trousers to Zhang Li, Li Shun sent fruit, eggs, cotton trousers to Chen Manna, Fan sent a cotton robe, mattress, cotton trousers to Wang Hongmei," etc. The dance hostesses were accustomed to gentle and romantic blessings, and were arrested so suddenly that they were not wearing cotton trousers. The taste of iron bars was especially cold. The reporter then went to the detention center to observe and saw a total of seventeen women, detained in separate rooms, eight in one room and nine in another. They were sitting around on the earthen platform in a semi-circle, looking quite distressed. Below the platform were leather shoes and satin shoes, scattered and messy, strewn all over the floor. Overcoats and fur cloaks were either draped over their shoulders or discarded on the ground, and there was not a word.</p>
<h3>Yuan Liang's Remarks</h3>
<p>The reporter interviewed Mayor Yuan Liang. Yuan Liang said that in this time of national emergency, the people of the country can only strive to save the country and there is no possibility of seeking pleasure. Therefore, at the beginning of his tenure, he issued an order prohibiting dancing and repeatedly captured dance hostesses and imposed fines. However, the dance hostesses who still secretly engaged in the dance business were fearless. Therefore, on Saturday, when they were singing and dancing wildly, police were sent to arrest them. Although it was 3 a.m., the dance halls were still brightly lit, indulging in decadent and extravagant behavior, which greatly harmed people's spirits. If they were students, how could they concentrate on their studies the next day? This is the purpose of the city government's determination to ban dancing. The authorities will punish these offenders according to the regulations and hope that people in society will make strong and righteous sanctions to save the declining customs. As for these captured offenders, a strict approach will be adopted and they will be punished according to the public order law. The respectable women and dance partners have been released. As for the dance hostesses who have actually engaged in the dance business, they will be dealt with according to the regulations on public order. The reporter further asked Yuan about how the arrested prostitutes should be handled. He said that this point would depend on the interpretation of the law, whether they would be treated as respectable women or treated the same as dance hostesses, which was still under consideration. However, if they were first-time offenders, they could be dealt with leniently. As for the dance hostesses who were found to be repeat offenders, they would be deported immediately. As for the Korean dance hostesses, because the Japanese side did not recognize their nationality, they would be dealt with in the same way as Chinese dance hostesses. He also said that he had sent other people to investigate whether dance halls were secretly selling dance tickets and would make further arrangements.</p>
<h3>Sentencing Situation</h3>
<p>At 3 p.m. on the 20th, the chief of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau re-interrogated a thousand dance hostesses. Judicial police interrogated the dance hostesses one by one from the detention room. The dance hostesses who arrived in court were disheveled and had traces of tears on their faces. Many of them were standing in line and were extremely frightened and crying. Section Chief Pu Zhizhong asked for their names, ages, places of origin, and dancing history. Some answered fluently, while others lowered their heads and remained silent. After the interrogation, each dance hostess was fined ten dollars and taken to the waiting room by the police to await bail. However, because it was late, it was not easy for the dance hostesses to obtain bail. By 6 p.m., no one had been released on bail. Later, Pu made a flexible arrangement, ordering each dance hostess to go out with a policeman to obtain bail and release. (November 21)</p>
<h3>Western Henan: Gold Mine Discovered in Song County, Area 80 Li Long and 40 Li Wide, Party Department Requests Central Government to Raise Funds for Mining</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Song County in Western Henan has always been a place where bandits are active, but it is surrounded by mountains and rich in mineral resources. Before the establishment of the Construction Department, geologist Wang Huizhi was sent to Gaodu County to examine and test the mineral quality. It is said that the gold mine area is 80 li long and 40 li wide. Yesterday, the County Party Department specially telegraphed the Provincial Party Department, requesting the Central Government to find ways to raise funds for mining in order to enrich the country and benefit the people. The original telegram stated: "1. It is found that Song County is surrounded by mountains and rich in mineral resources. Previously, the Construction Department commissioned geologist Wang Huizhi to examine the mineral quality in Song Gaodu, collect mineral samples, and repeatedly test them. The quality is pure and heavy and it is the richest resource in Henan. The gold mine area is about 80 li long and about 40 li wide. The source of profit is vast and urgently needs to be developed. However, the mining and excavation have not been effective, and the head of the Construction Department has been replaced, so the work has been stopped. Therefore, this gold and silver mineral resource has not been discovered to this day. The goods are abandoned on the ground, and the effort has failed, which is very regrettable. Now that China's economy is bankrupt and people's livelihoods are declining, the way to save the situation is to develop resources and establish factories to restore the rural economy and ensure sufficient revenue for the national treasury, so that the national strength can be strengthened and the national crisis can be resolved. Moreover, at this time, cotton and wheat loans are valued, and production is emphasized in order to revitalize industry and commerce and revive the country. Since Song County has these gold and silver mineral resources, it is necessary to continue mining. In addition, Song County is located in a strategic location in the southwest corner, which is an important route for the bandits to flee to Sichuan. Years of natural disasters and banditry have left refugees everywhere, and starving people are crying for help, urgently awaiting rescue. If mining can be carried out, it will not only help the victims of the disaster, but also be an important plan for the national economy and people's livelihood. This department is responsible for speaking out for the people, and it is our duty to telegraph the Department of Land Reclamation and present it to the Central Government, asking them to find ways to raise funds and continue mining. We implore you to look forward to it. Chinese Kuomintang Song County Party Department, Kousheng." (Chat on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Border Area of Henan, Hubei and Anhui: Remnant Bandits Completely Collapse, Bandit Leaders Turn Against Each Other, Bandit Soldiers Suffer Unbearably, Internal Opinions Differ, People Have Lost Faith, Suppression Army Implements Fifth Encirclement Plan</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnant bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have been painfully suppressed by the various armies led by Liu Zhenhua. They have fled in groups and turned against each other internally. They have now completely collapsed. Liu Zhenhua will return to Huangchuan after visiting Jiang in Nanchang to ask for instructions, and will implement the fifth encirclement plan. The period of elimination should not be far away. It is found that the remnant bandit organization in the area, in terms of politics, has a pseudo-Hubei-Henan-Anhui Provincial Committee as the highest authority, located in Ziyun District of Huang'an. Below the Provincial Soviet, there are two routes in Northeastern Hubei and Northwestern Anhui. Below the routes, there are county, district, township, and village governments and trade unions at all levels. In terms of military affairs, the military is the highest command authority, adopting a three-three system, with three divisions per army, three regiments per division, three battalions per regiment, and three companies per battalion. There are also independent regiments in each county and guerrilla teams in each district and township. The organization is very tight. The pseudo-Provincial Committee and Secretary-General is Shen Zemin. The Provincial Committee and Commander of the 25th Army is Wu Huanxian. The Provincial Committee and Commander of the 28th Army is Liao Rongkun. The Provincial Committee and Political Commissar of the 25th Army and Commander-in-Chief of the Guerrilla is Dai Jiying. The Chairman of the Provincial Soviet and Political Commissar of the 75th Division is Gao Junting. The Provincial Committee and Chairman of the People's Committee is Zheng Weisang. The Provincial Committee and Secretary of the Northeast Hubei Road Committee is Xu Baosan. The Organization Minister of the Provincial Committee and the Northwest Anhui Road Committee is Guo Shuzhong. The Commander of the 73rd Division is Ding Shaoqing. The Commander of the 74th Division is Xu Haidong. The Commander of the 75th Division is Yao Jiafang. The strength of the bandits is the greatest with Wu Huanxian, followed by Dai Jiying, and then Liao Rongkun. Last month, the National Army attacked Da Xiaofoshan, and the bandits suffered the greatest losses. Wu Huanxian and Dai Jiying led their troops to flee to Western Anhui. However, because the Ziyun District of Huang'an and the Southern District of Guangshan are their political centers, they were unwilling to give up. They then fled back to Eastern Hubei from the Anhui border. The pseudo-25th Army Headquarters and the 74th Division all returned to their old nests. Part of them were still cut off by the National Army and fled to Western Anhui and Northern Anhui. The strength of the bandits gradually dispersed. After the National Army launched another general attack, the bandits were unable to resist and desperately fled to Laojun Mountain and Datai Mountain in the northwest. The pseudo-25th Army Headquarters, the entire 75th Division, and the Provincial Soviet Road Soviet Guerrilla Headquarters all moved to Datai Mountain, and a regiment of the pseudo-73rd Division and other local guerrillas stayed in the Ziyun District old nest. Another regiment fled to the northern district of Huangpi Xiaogan to harass. When the National Army attacked, it eased slightly, and the entire army fled back to the Ziyun District, fleeing around, and their strength was greatly reduced again. At this time, the internal opinions of the bandits were very deep. The commander of the pseudo-75th Division, Yao Jiafang, was shot dead by Wu Huanxian, and Tong Xiyuan succeeded him. The commander of the pseudo-28th Army, Liao Rongkun, was also killed by Wu. The remnant bandits fled to Western Anhui and Northern Anhui due to incompatible forces, resulting in a great reduction in the strength of Northeastern Hubei. Together with various teams, there were only more than 2,000 guns. The bandits in Western Anhui and Northern Anhui had no more than 3,000 guns. The National Army took advantage of the victory and successively recovered Yaozui, Ziyun District, and Laojun Mountain. Other bandit-free areas were fortified and cleared the fields to prevent them from fleeing and harassing. The material supply of the bandits was completely cut off, and ammunition could not be replenished. Now, except for some who fled west across the Pinghan Railway, the rest have adopted fleeting guerrilla tactics in the hope of prolonging their lives. However, the bandit soldiers have no food or clothing, and they are suffering unbearably. Many of them have surrendered to the National Army with their weapons. The people have also become aware and have flocked to the National Army. Even in Ziyun, Guangnan, Kouziguan, Baisha River, and Shangxia Yanzhi, the people who were most deeply reddened in the bandit-so-called resolute areas, have completely shaken their faith in the bandits, resulting in the collapse of today. Liu Zhenhua ordered the various armies to transfer troops to search and suppress the area when the bandit was about to collapse. "They are strictly preventing him from fleeing elsewhere. In Hanchuan, when he went to Ganzhou, he and Cao Haosen, He Chengjian, Sun Lianzhong, Hao Mengling, Xiao Zhichu, etc. discussed the strategy and telegraphed to the various departments to obey the order and prepare. When Liu returned to Huang from Ganzhou, he would follow the central government's fifth encirclement plan and conduct a large-scale search to eliminate them within a time limit." (20th)</p>
<h3>Tragic Case of the Entire Family Murdered in Jiaozhi, Suzhou</h3>
<p>A tragic case of three deaths in a family occurred in Jiaozhi Town, Suzhou yesterday (23rd) morning. The incident occurred at the home of Fu Shou, family of 35, in Xizha Shangtang Town. In addition to his elderly mother, Zhou, his wife, Wang, and his son, A Jin, he hired a long-term worker, Chen Hongsheng, and a shepherd boy, Jin A'gen. Ma's brother-in-law, Lu A'quan, lived in Xiatang. On the 22nd, Ma's relative, Zhang Yitai, was marrying his son, and the whole family went to congratulate him. At about 8 p.m., Ma and his wife and children went home first, while his mother, Zhou, went to live at his brother-in-law's house, and Chen Hongsheng and Lu A'gen stayed at Zhang's house to help. At 2 a.m. on the 22nd, Chen and Lu went home together. After separating at Ma's door, Chen saw that Ma's gate was wide open and there were no lights inside. He called out but there was no response. He was quite surprised and suspicious, so he lit a fire and went inside. He went straight to the master bedroom and saw that Ma, his wife Wang, and his son A Jin had all been brutally murdered and were lying in a pool of blood, covered in knife wounds. Ma's large intestine had even flowed out. All three were naked and unclothed. Chen immediately went to the river dock to wake up the shepherd boy and reported to Lu A'quan. They then reported to the police station. Branch Chief Xie went to investigate and saw that the three had died tragically, and the things in the room were also in disarray. One hundred and fifty yuan of silver dollars was missing from Ma's mother Zhou's room. It was impossible to prove whether it was robbery and murder, revenge killing, or adultery and killing. Chen and Lu and the local security chief came to the city and asked the local prosecutor's office to come and investigate and arrest the murderer. The prosecutor's office decided to send Prosecutor Lü to investigate tomorrow morning (24th) and then review.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Gang Robs, Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>As winter defense has just begun, robbery cases have occurred again. Yangshuyuan Town in the 16th District of the county is lined with shops and densely populated. Yu Dabao, a resident of Xijie Town, is in his sixties. He used to run a dyeing workshop, but he has recently closed it. Unexpectedly, at about 7 p.m. the previous evening (22nd), more than ten bandits suddenly came to Yu's house. Three bandits went straight into the inner room, while the others were distributed around Yu's house. After the three bandits entered, one of them took out a pistol from his sleeve and forced Yu Dabao into the inner room. Yu was shocked and his face turned ashen. His wife, Mrs. Mou, was horrified at the sight and cried out for help. Her voice was heard outside. At that time, a passerby happened to be passing by and immediately rushed to report to the 36th Detachment of the Town's Business Corps. The detachment leader personally led all the members of the corps, armed with guns and ammunition, to Xijie. There was a gate on the alley. First, the members of the corps closed the gate. At this time, the scattered bandits in the alley had already become aware of it. In an instant, they fled in different directions. Because it was dark at the time, they could not be caught. The members of the corps were still afraid that the bandits in the house would escape, so they were distributed around Yu's house. They first fired a shot into the sky as a warning, and then a part of the members of the corps broke through the door and rushed in. The three bandits were shocked at the sight and immediately jumped onto the roof. One bandit turned around and fired several shots in an attempt to resist. After the members of the corps worked hard to encircle and capture them, the bandit with the gun took the opportunity to escape. Two bandits ran wildly to the west, flew over more than ten houses, jumped into the Qian's house, and fled to the bedroom of an old woman. In an instant, the members of the corps arrived and dragged the two bandits out from under the bed and captured them. They were taken to the detachment headquarters. The two bandits both spoke with the accent of Jiangyin. They were each in their twenties. One was Shao Apei, and the other was surnamed Jiang. It has now been decided to hand them over to the county government for handling today.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Civilian Maternity Hospital is Scheduled</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Yan Shenyu of this county previously received an order from the province to immediately prepare for the establishment of a civilian maternity hospital. However, because the local funding was not available, he could not immediately comply. Recently, he received another order to urge him, so it is urgent to prepare for its establishment. He had consulted with local agencies and gentry to request subsidies for funding in order to realize it as soon as possible. Yesterday (23rd) morning at 10 o'clock, County Magistrate Yan invited County Party Committee Member Xu Yongji, Chairman of the Municipal Management Committee Gu Shuzhi, and County Asset Office Representative Gong Yaosun to the County Government Conference Room to hold a discussion meeting to discuss the implementation plan. It was decided: 1. The location for the civilian maternity hospital should be established at the old site of the County Labor Hospital; 2. The date of establishment is planned to be implemented from January 23; 3. The start-up fee will be allocated from the National Salvation Fund at the request of the Party Department for 500 yuan; 4. The recurring expenses will be subsidized by the county government for 50 yuan and the city government for 100 yuan. Try to operate this amount for three months first, and then reduce it according to the hospital's own income. The objects and supplies of the Labor Hospital and the Epidemic Hospital will be transferred to the hospital to save expenses and conserve resources.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Mutual Fight Over Trivial Matter Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>In Xu'an Dun, Xushi Township, in this county, the farmer Xu Genfa was quite violent. A son of Qian Genqi from the same village went to Xu's vegetable field on the evening of the 21st to pull up vegetable seedlings. Xu saw him and thought he was stealing, so he went to negotiate with Qian. At first, they started arguing, and then they fought each other. Qian then hit Xu hard with a carrying pole, and he immediately fell to the ground. After a while, he died. His younger brother, Xu Gen, reported to the Public Security Bureau. After Qian heard the news, he escaped to avoid punishment. The township chief, Xu Huizhang, together with the township officers, reported to the county government to send someone to investigate. The county government immediately sent Liang, a trial officer, Zhou, a clerk, and an investigator to take a gasoline boat to investigate. It was found that the deceased had multiple fist wounds on his chest and had died from being beaten while alive. His family was ordered to bury the body. The murderer Qian Genqi was on the run and had not been caught. The county issued a warrant for his arrest for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Detective Team Captures Female Bandit</h3>
<p>A robbery case occurred in Miaoqiao Town, Eighth District, in April of this year. The bandits were on the run and had not been caught. On the 21st, the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau received a tip that the bandits in the case were hiding in Qicun Village, Zhitang Township. Captain Zhu of the team immediately led a dozen team members by gasoline boat that night and arrived on the morning of the 22nd. The bandits had already heard the news and fled. Only the female bandit leader Xu Meimei was captured. She was immediately taken to the city. It is said that the female bandit is extremely fierce and can fire two pistols. She has also committed many crimes.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order for County Government to Grow Grain</h3>
<p>The provincial government, in order to relieve the rural collapse, ordered counties of A, B, and C grades to accumulate grain separately. This county is listed as a county of A grade and was ordered to raise 90,000 yuan to accumulate 20,000 dan of grain, and it was limited to be realized within the shortest possible time. After receiving the order, the county government ordered the First District Office to quickly investigate temples for storage. It has now found empty houses in Xingfu Temple and Sanfeng Xia Yuan, which are estimated to hold more than 1,000 dan. Other places are still being sought. As for the special funds, they will be remitted by the province.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Chen Hongfan's Home Robbed and Pillaged</h3>
<p>The home of Chen Hongfan, the township chief of Jifu Township in the 19th District of Wuyi County, was suddenly visited by many bandits the previous evening. They smashed open the back door with stones, turned Chen's elderly mother over, and beat her with wooden sticks, injuring her. All of Chen's rooms were robbed and looted. The Mengcheng Beipu Business Corps rushed to encircle and capture them, but the bandits had already escaped. The inspection revealed that the losses were very heavy. Yesterday (22nd), the District Office reported to the County Government for strict investigation of the stolen goods and bandits for arrest and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Rugao: Robbery Occurs in Shuangdian District</h3>
<p>The home of Gu Rongjue, a resident of the 11th Jia Township in Shuangdian District of this county, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits at about 1 a.m. the previous evening (18th). They spoke in mixed dialects and carried flashlights, guns, wooden sticks, and other items. They fired shots into the air as a warning and broke in. First, they tied up the family members one by one, burned them with fire, and forced them to hand over silver dollars. It is estimated that they were robbed of current silver, banknotes, and jewelry, resulting in heavy losses. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and reported to the county for tracking down and arresting.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Plan to Reorganize Schools in Cheng City</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education believed that Cheng County's education fees were in arrears for eight or nine months, and the income and expenditure were far from sufficient, and it was about to go bankrupt. It specially sent four provincial supervisors, Feng Ce, Yi Zuolin, Hua Jingfu, and Ji He Ruan Zhidong, to Cheng for special inspections, which have lasted for more than two months. He is keen to clean up the city and township education properties and school land, and is deeply dissatisfied with most educational institutions. A method has now been drafted and submitted to the Department of Education for review and approval. It will be ordered to the Education Bureau to implement it in the next semester. The main points of the reorganization are: (1) Principal Jiang Yuzong of the County Middle School has long wanted to resign. Since the Department commissioned the inspection, he has been deeply dissatisfied with the school's financial income and expenditure, and Jiang's intention to resign is even more firm. More than 30 people are competing for the position of principal. If there are other reactions, it will be suspended immediately and the junior high school department of Nanjin will be expanded to accommodate them. (2) There were originally 13 primary schools in the city. Except for the City Ten School, which was suspended due to poor management, two primary schools, Jizhong and Banqiao, were established. The City School's expenses are more than 1,400 yuan per month. The Education Bureau subsidizes more than 600 yuan per month from the tax items. The remaining funds are paid by the Education Property Management Committee. In recent years, the number of receipts has been short, and there have been arrears for seven or eight months. There is a proposal to suspend Tanxiang Primary School and Shoushan Primary School. After the Department commissioned the inspection, it strongly advocated tightening up expenses and ensuring that income and expenditure are suitable. The Tanxiang Primary School, which is squeezed next to the Beidajie Primary School, and the Shoushan Primary School, which is poorly managed, are determined to be suspended. (3) The Zhongjie Primary School in the city, which is affiliated with the private Chenghan Senior Primary School, and the Qixiaixiang Primary School in the county, which is affiliated with the private Fuyan Senior Primary School, are not in line with the departmental regulations. The opinion of the Department Commission is that the two schools must become public or private, and the division must be unified. After the county-run primary school is uniformly changed to private, the county government will subsidize one-third of the expenses. (4) The county-run Beidajie Primary School, which is affiliated with the private Junyong Senior Primary School, has developed rapidly in recent years, while the Chengbei Primary School has few students in the corner of the north. There is already a senior primary school that can accommodate them, so Chengbei will be changed to a primary school, and Junyong and Beidajie Primary Schools will be merged into a public complete primary school to comply with the Department's order. (5) The number of grades in the primary schools in the county has never been stipulated. In addition to the complex system of classes, there are four, five, seven, and eight schools in a single classroom, which is quite inconvenient for students to move up and stay. The Department Commission is determined to tighten up and stipulate that each primary school should have four classrooms at most and no more than eight classrooms. All five, six, and seven classrooms will be tightened up into four classrooms.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Cheng Zhuang and Gao Tong Granted Bail</h3>
<p>Former Fifth and Sixth District Chiefs of the Water Police, Cheng Zhuang, and Chief Accountant Gao Tong, who were placed under strict supervision by the former Civil Affairs Director Zhao Qi last spring, have been under custody for more than a year and six months. Last month, they were transferred to the judicial authorities by the Provincial Government. After several investigations, no clear evidence of corruption has been found. It is reported that yesterday, the Zhenjiang District Court summoned Cheng and Gao again. Prosecutor Zhu Zai-geng opened a court session to interrogate them, asking them in detail about the circumstances of the cases. The two requested bail, which was granted by the court. They were ordered to be escorted out to find guarantors for their release.</p>
<h3>County Police Capture a Large Number of Bandits</h3>
<p>Bu Zhenhai, the Captain of the Zhenjiang County Police Brigade, led 30 policemen and 6 cavalrymen last night, according to orders, and at 2:00 AM, they rushed to Qin Fen Dun in the third district of the southern countryside. They surrounded and captured 15 bandits. It is said that the bandit leader is Zhou Jikan, using the alias Tan Yongfu. The bandits include Wang Changying (nickname Luo Kan), Song Yangke, Jin Hongxi, Zhong Youfu, Xu Yonggen, Ma Zhenbiao, Li Heer, Zhang Erdongzi, Sun Yuqian, Liu Zhengzhong, Wang Fake, Zhang Shuanggen, Zhang Shanwen, Liu Mengchen, etc. This afternoon at 2:00 PM, they were briefly interrogated and transferred to the County Government. It is reported that they will be transferred to the Security Office for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Incense Shop Employee Dies Suddenly</h3>
<p>In Tianningmen Street in this city, there is a Sang Hengshun incense shop employee named Zheng Cunwang, from Taizhou, 46 years old, who has worked at the shop for many years. He was a frugal person. Yesterday (21st) after dinner, he suddenly fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth, and shortly after, he died. The shop owner telegraphed his family in Taizhou and reported to the court to send someone to investigate.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou District Head Wounded by Bandit Fire</h3>
<p>Xia Meikui, the tenth district head of this county, previously led his troops to Gengtan Township to suppress bandits. After three hours of fierce fighting, the troops could not hold on and retreated. Unexpectedly, they encountered a small group of armed bandits midway. The bandits cunningly pretended to be the Gaoyou bandit suppression army. District Head Xia did not realize the deception and fell into their trap. He was surrounded by the bandits, and one soldier was killed. District Head Xia was also wounded by gunfire.</p>
<h3>Bandits Occupy Hazixia</h3>
<p>The Luyang Lake, bordering this county and Jiangdu, has always been a place where bandits appear and disappear. This autumn, the two counties jointly suppressed them, and it was initially cleared. Unexpectedly, near the Hazixia area on the lake shore, about two to three hundred bandits have gathered, all wearing military uniforms, fully armed with guns and ammunition, and several machine guns. Their momentum is huge, resembling an army. The farmers in that area have now fled completely. After the county government received the report, it dispatched Police Captain Zhu Hua and Water Patrol Team Sun Dianyuan this morning (21st) to lead troops to suppress them.</p>

<h3>City News: Shanghai Declares Martial Law After the Fujian Incident; Central Committee Members in Shanghai Express Distress over Fujian; Central Government's Attitude is Temporarily Watchful</h3>
<p>After the Fujian Incident occurred, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately convened an emergency meeting with the chiefs of all districts and teams, as well as the heads of various sections, to instruct on defense measures. They dispersed late at night. Therefore, starting yesterday, the 23rd, martial law was declared, from 9:00 PM every night to 6:00 AM the next morning. During martial law, all districts and teams uniformly increased patrol teams, which were divided into groups to patrol back and forth. Supervisors, along with male and female investigators and detectives, inspected pedestrians at key points, checking suspicious individuals to prevent reactionaries from taking the opportunity to stir up trouble and maintain public security.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that after Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others established the so-called People's Government in Fujian on the 20th, they secretly dispatched a large number of personnel from Xiamen to Shanghai to conduct activities. These personnel have already arrived in Shanghai and have met with the Central Committee members in Shanghai. The names and positions of these personnel are kept highly secret. It is also learned that they have installed a wireless transmitter in a certain location in Shanghai to secretly communicate with Fuzhou. This morning, a reporter visited Mr. Li Liejun, and the following are Mr. Li's remarks and information obtained from various sources:</p>
<h3>Whether Feng Yuxiang Participated is Still Unclear</h3>
<p>According to telegrams from Fujian, the circular announcing the establishment of the so-called People's Government was led by Feng Yuxiang. When the reporter asked Mr. Li Liejun about this, he said that Mr. Feng Huanzhang is still recuperating in Mount Tai and has not expressed any negative views on state affairs. Whether Mr. Feng participated in this Fujian Incident is still unknown. Therefore, he has sent someone to Fujian to investigate and clarify the matter. It is speculated that Mr. Feng would not do this.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members in Shanghai Dissatisfied with Fujian</h3>
<p>Mr. Li continued, the Central Committee members in Shanghai have not yet made a comprehensive statement on the Fujian Incident. However, at a time when internal and external troubles are approaching, they feel extremely pained that the people of the country are not yet enlightened and are taking actions that disturb the country. The Central Committee members in Shanghai have prepared a lengthy article on the Fujian issue and telegraphed it to Chairman Chiang in Nanchang, outlining strategies for saving the country and ensuring its survival.</p>
<h3>Li and Chen Meet to Discuss Patrolling Fujian</h3>
<p>Vice Minister of the Navy, Li Shijia, was ordered by Minister Chen the night before last at 11:00 PM to take a night train to Shanghai to meet with Commander of the First Fleet, Chen Jiliang, to discuss the issue of patrolling the Min River. Mr. Li arrived at the North Station at 7:30 AM yesterday and went directly to the headquarters of the First Fleet at Gaochangmiao to meet with Mr. Chen. They had a long conversation lasting about an hour, with detailed discussions on how to deal with the Fujian rebellion. Mr. Chen and Mr. Li then went out together around 9:00 AM. It is reported that they went to Songkou to inspect the stationed ships and meet with Li Mengbin, the commander of the Mawei Naval Port, who passed through Songkou yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>The First Fleet is Preparing to Depart</h3>
<p>According to news from naval circles here, the First Fleet of the Navy is currently stationed in Gaochangmiao, the Second Fleet is stationed in Hankou, the Torpedo Fleet is stationed in Nanjing, and the Training Fleet is stationed in Songkou. Commander of the First Fleet, Chen Jiliang, after receiving the order from the Ministry to lead ships to patrol the Min River and respond to the Fujian rebellion as circumstances dictate, has already ordered all ships under the First Fleet to concentrate on the Jiangmian River surface in Gaochangmiao, ready to depart. The main warships of the First Fleet, Ninghai, Chou, and Hairong, have all been concentrated in Gaochangmiao and are ready. As for the departure date, it has not yet been determined. After the First Fleet departs, the defense of Songhu will be the responsibility of the Training Fleet.</p>
<h3>Li Mengbin Passed Through Songkou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Li Mengbin, the commander of the Mawei Naval Port, was ordered by the Ministry to refuse when the 19th Route Army sent troops to forcibly take over during the Fujian rebellion. He led his subordinates to resist fiercely, but due to the disparity in numbers, he was unable to hold out. He took the opportunity to escape danger and boarded the Haining gunboat, which passed through Songkou yesterday afternoon and sailed to Nanjing. It is expected to arrive in Beijing this morning. After arriving in Beijing, Mr. Li will visit Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan to report on the circumstances of his withdrawal from Mawei.</p>
<h3>Marine Corps in Fujian Concentrated in Sandu</h3>
<p>The Marine Corps stationed in Fujian consists of two brigades: the First Brigade stationed in Southern Fujian and the Second Brigade stationed in Eastern Fujian. After the Fujian rebellion occurred, the First Brigade immediately retreated to Sandu, while the Second Brigade concentrated in Xiamen. However, according to news from naval circles here yesterday morning, the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian has been ordered to concentrate in Sandu. Only a small number of Marine Corps troops remain stationed in Xiamen to maintain security.</p>
<h3>Chen Wenlin Telegraphed Arrival in Xiamen</h3>
<p>Chen Wenlin, the director of the Naval Aviation Office in Xiamen, recently came to Shanghai on a Shanghai-Guangdong plane to visit Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan for instructions. On the 21st, he finished his official business and returned to Xiamen on a Shanghai-Guangdong plane. Dr. You Pengxi, a friend of Mr. Chen, received a telegram from Mr. Chen the day before yesterday stating that he had arrived safely in Xiamen at noon on the 21st. For days, there have been rumors that many planes from the Naval Aviation Office in Xiamen have been forcibly taken over by the Fujian side. Zeng Yijing, the director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, denied this claim. According to Mr. Zeng, the Xiamen Aviation Office has a total of seven or eight planes, including seagulls and terns. The rumors that they have been confiscated by the Fujian side are completely inaccurate. As for whether they will fly to Shanghai in the future, it depends on whether it is necessary. They are currently awaiting orders. Huang Qiang, the commander of the Zhangzhou-Xiamen Garrison, went to the province on the 22nd. This is the information I obtained from the Fujian side.</p>
<h3>Seizure of Two Gunboats Confirmed</h3>
<p>The Naval Hydrographic Office of the Navy Ministry, in order to survey the waters near Mawei in Fujian Province, temporarily borrowed the Qingyun and Jingxing gunboats from the Coastal Defense Office to conduct surveys. During this Fujian rebellion, the two gunboats were forcibly seized at Guantou, outside the port of Mawei, the day before yesterday. The current situation of the surveying team members on board is unknown. However, the news of the seizure of the two ships was confirmed yesterday by the Hydrographic Office in this port.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu's Followers Active in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that its reporter has learned from a certain source that the so-called "People's Revolutionary Government" is currently seeking support from various quarters. It is said that Chen Mingshu has dispatched his followers scattered in Ping and Hu to conduct activities separately. Traces of these people have been found at the offices of the Central Committee members in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Li Mengbin Still in Sandu, According to Reports</h3>
<p>The Daily News reports that yesterday it was widely rumored that after the Mawei Naval Port Command was taken over by the 19th Route Army, Commander Li Mengbin immediately took the Haining gunboat to Beijing to report, and that he passed through Wusongkou yesterday. The Daily News reporter learned from Vice Minister of the Navy Li Shijia that Mr. Li has not left Fujian and is currently still in Sandu, because the Navy Ministry has ordered Mr. Li to guard the Sandu naval port and not to move lightly without military orders. Yesterday's report that he had passed through Songkou to go to Beijing was purely a misreport.</p>
<h3>Salt Tax Authorities Also Taken Over</h3>
<p>After the Fujian Incident, all centrally administered institutions in Fujian Province were successively occupied by the 19th Route Army. The Daily News reporter learned from the Salt Affairs Audit General Office yesterday that the Fujian Salt Affairs Audit Sub-Office and the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office were taken over yesterday by Fan Hanjie, dispatched by the Fujian side. Associate Rossi has sent a telegram to Shanghai to report that all personnel in the office, from the associate downwards, will not be changed for the time being. The Xiamen Salt Affairs Audit Sub-Office and the Transport Deputy were also taken over by Huang Huanan. Lu Yansun, the director of the Xiamen Sub-Office, has fled to Gulangyu and telegraphed for instructions.</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and the Third Party's Huang Qixiang, among others, privately formed a People's Government in Fujian and confiscated all military and political institutions in Fujian belonging to the central government. The situation has changed drastically. Currently, what everyone is paying attention to is what kind of attitude the central government will take to deal with the incident. The following is a summary of the information obtained from various sources in this port yesterday.</p>
<h3>Emphasizing Observation and Waiting for It to Change on Its Own</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter met with a gentleman from Beijing who was familiar with the Fujian Incident. According to him, the outbreak of the Fujian Incident and the establishment of another government, and the complexity of the participating members, is well known to ordinary people. However, if the Fujian side wants to use the full strength of the six divisions of the 19th Route Army to invade Guangdong Province, I am afraid things will not be easy. As for the Fujian side's alliance with the Communists, although it has some military implications, it is probably not yet time for a genuine mutual understanding without any doubts. Moreover, the 19th Route Army has repeatedly fought fiercely with the Red Army in the past. Even if they can coexist for a while, it will definitely not last long. In this case, the Fujian side can only first reorganize the local area, consolidate its position, and then challenge the central government. The central government regards Chen and Li of Fujian as the main culprits and wants to actively use military force to eradicate them, but the situation may not expand. The central government understands the inner workings of the Fujian affair and knows that carrying out military operations too hastily will ensure that the Fujian army will be completely communized. At that time, it will create opportunities for the Communist Party instead. Therefore, the central government will now focus on watching and listening to it change on its own, because there are still many problems between Fujian-Guangdong and Fujian-Communist. When the internal changes in Fujian begin, we can take advantage of the situation, so as to avoid the southwest corner suffering too much damage. As for defense, it is of course necessary. Therefore, now not only has the defense of Zhejiang and Jiangxi been strengthened, but the navy must also monitor the various ports along the coast of eastern Fujian.</p>
<h3>Navy Conferring and Dispatching Warships to Fujian</h3>
<p>Since all institutions of the central navy in Fujian Province were taken over, all of its important warships have sailed to Shanghai. It is learned that the ships currently anchored at Gaochangmiao Port include Ninghai, Hairong, Jiangkun, Tongji, Weining, Suning, Jing'an, etc. Those at Songkou include Haichou, Yingrui, Chutong, Yixian, etc. Training Team Commander Chen Xunyong is stationed on the Haichou ship, waiting for the situation. Li Mengbin, the commander of the Changmen Fortress who escaped from Fujian, passed through Songkou yesterday morning on the Haining ship to report everything to Beijing. As of yesterday, the Fujian side has not sent troops to take over Xiamen. At the same time, Huang Qiang, the commander of the Zhangzhou-Xiamen Garrison, also stated that he would not go to take over Xiamen. The reason for this is, of course, because the Fujian side has no navy. Xiamen is also isolated in the sea, and it cannot be defended without ships. Therefore, they used the pretext of foreign relations to declare abandonment. The central government regards Xiamen as one of the sea ports of Fujian, so it will dispatch warships to station there in the near future and monitor the entry and exit of the port.</p>
<h3>Li Shijia Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Meet Chen</h3>
<p>Li Shijia, the permanent vice minister of the Navy Ministry, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and went to the First Fleet Headquarters in Gaochangmiao to meet with Commander Chen Jiliang to discuss the Fujian issue. Several telegrams were sent to Beijing and Xiamen. It was not until 12:15 noon that he and Chen Jiliang went out together by car for lunch. The reporter met Li in front of the headquarters. When Li saw the reporter, he covered his mouth with his hand and repeatedly said, "I don't want to talk about the Fujian issue." "I have no news about the Fujian issue." Later, the reporter asked Li to respond to the fact that the central government's handling measures, which were of course related to military affairs, were not convenient to announce. Li replied, "The Mawei area has been taken over, but Xiamen is still peaceful as usual. I don't know when Commander Li Mengbin of Haining ship passed through Songkou. It is difficult to make a judgment on whether the Xiamen Aviation Office needs to be relocated, but the Navy Ministry has no such intention at the moment. All the two ships intercepted by Fujian are surveying ships and are not important." When asked about the purpose of this trip, Li said, "I must come to Shanghai once a week to handle routine official business." At that time, Chen Jiliang was nearby, so the reporter asked Li, "Is it true that the Navy Ministry has sent Chen to lead ships to Fujian?" Li only said, "I don't know the details," while Chen said nearby, "Not true," "I'm not going." After the conversation, they parted. Later, it was heard that the captains of the Haigou and Jingxing surveying ships intercepted by Fujian, Zeng Wei and Ye Shuiyuan, had fled. This has not yet been confirmed by the Navy.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Naval Aircraft Will Not Be Relocated</h3>
<p>The reporter then went to the Aircraft Manufacturing Office in this port to meet with Director Zeng Yijing and asked about Chen Wenlin's departure to Xiamen and the naval aviation situation in Xiamen. According to him, Director Chen returned to Xiamen the day before yesterday, and there has been no telegram from him. I heard that the situation in Xiamen is relatively stable, and the Aviation Office has not been taken over by the Fujian side. The Xiamen Aviation Office originally had several aircraft, and the Shanghai Aviation Office was merged into Xiamen. There are now seven or eight aircraft, including homemade Jianghong, Jiangluan, Jiangci, and Jiangou, etc., but they are all reconnaissance training aircraft. When the 19th Route Army attacked and destroyed Chen Guoyao in the past, it captured five or six aircraft. Chen originally set up an aircraft office with more than a dozen aircraft. Apart from the fact that half of them were destroyed, the rest were all captured by the 19th Route Army. In addition, there were aircraft donated by overseas Chinese and aircraft purchased by the 19th Route Army, but the number is unknown. The Xiamen Naval Aviation Office has probably not received a relocation order from the central government. Otherwise, my office would have news.</p>
<h3>Fujian Merchants' Property Not Yet Confiscated</h3>
<p>The Fujian Luhushan Funing Guild Hall in Shanghai convened its 46th board meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM due to reports that the Fujian People's Government had confiscated the huge properties of huge merchants such as Luo Mianhou, Huang Zhanyun, and Liu Chonglun. More than ten directors attended, including Zhang Yinbai, Wu Hongshi, Luo Chaoshe, Jin Xirong, Chen Xibi, Huang Renhang, Wang Zisheng, Lin Junfu, Huang Jiaxiang, Huang Renwu, Huang Yufu, Chen Runnan, and Luo Shuxiang. Huang Yufu chaired the meeting and Huang Renhang recorded the minutes. After the ritual was completed, the chairman reported that today (yesterday) a news agency reported that the Fuzhou People's Government had confiscated the properties of three huge merchants, which did not conform to various facts. He asked for discussion. Subsequently, Huang Renwu, Zhang Yinbai, and Chen Runnan successively expressed their views. They all believed that many passengers came on the Hua'an ship, and they had not heard of this news. Today, the banks of our gang, Luo Henghe and Huang Fengji, etc., still have telegraphic transfers coming and going, and they are all collected and resolved as usual. Moreover, recently, the Fujian firms have also sent telegrams to order goods, and last night, the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed that the business market was normal and the financial situation was stable. Based on the above facts, which do not conform to the news reports, is it possible to correct the news media? It was decided that a letter should be sent to various newspapers for correction. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned. The New News Agency received a letter from the Luhushan Funing Guild Hall yesterday, which is recorded as follows: We have read in today's newspaper a report that the properties of three huge merchants in Fuzhou have been confiscated. Our guild has not received this news. However, according to our investigation, the banks of Luo Henghe and Huang Fengji, etc., still have telegraphic transfers coming and going, and they have all been collected and resolved as usual. Moreover, recently, the Fujian firms have also sent telegrams to order goods, and last night, the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed that the business market was normal and the financial situation was stable. According to this situation, it is sufficient to prove that the report of the confiscation of the properties of three huge merchants is obviously inaccurate. The above situation should be disclosed to various newspapers. We hereby send a letter to request that you publish it in various newspapers. Sincerely, the New News Agency, the Luhushan Guild Hall Xinsheng Society reports that since the Fujian Incident, the shipping companies such as China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, and Changan have decided to temporarily suspend the Shanghai-Fuzhou line of ships. The Nanhua Banhuashang shipping company has decided to stop at Xiamen to avoid being detained. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Fujian Route to be Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The ships operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line include the Wanxiang of Sanbei Company, the Jiesheng of Jardine Matheson Company, the Qinshun of China Merchants Bureau, and the Huaan of Changan Company. The Taisun ship of China Merchants Bureau has stopped sailing to Fuzhou due to the refusal of the Fujian Sanbei Guild Hall in Shanghai to load goods for transportation to Fujian, and there are very few goods on each voyage. It has been changed to sail on the Shanghai-Xiamen line. The Huaan ship of Changan Company has decided to stop sailing to Fuzhou and change to sail on the Shanghai-Tianjin line due to the chaotic order in Fuzhou and the fear that the Fujian authorities will detain the ship. It will be closed today and depart tomorrow. As for the Wanxiang of Sanbei Company and the Jiesheng of Jardine Matheson Company, both of which sailed from Shanghai to Fuzhou on the 20th of this month, it is said that in order to avoid danger, it has been decided to temporarily suspend sailing to Fuzhou after returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Ship Stops at Xiamen</h3>
<p>The Taisun ship of the state-run China Merchants Bureau Shanghai-Fuzhou line, after changing to the Shanghai-Xiamen line, has decided to stop at Xiamen to avoid being detained and confiscated as state-run, since Xiamen has been occupied by the 19th Route Army. For the ships sailing on the Xiamen-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong line, it has been decided to stop at Xiamen. After the Taisun ship returns to Shanghai, it will be decided to stop sailing on the Shanghai-Xiamen line, take advantage of this to enter the dock for repairs, and change to the Shanghai-Haizhou line. Other Chinese shipping companies have also decided to stop at the Xiamen Wharf to avoid being detained. However, the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong line of foreign Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies still dock at the wharf in Xiamen as usual.</p>
<h3>Wanxiang Ship Telegraphed Still Safe</h3>
<p>The Wanxiang ship of Sanbei Company Shanghai-Fuzhou line arrived in Fuzhou yesterday. At 3:40 PM, the Shanghai headquarters received a telegram from Wanxiang saying, "Wanxiang has arrived in Fujian, the place is still safe, Wanxiang is scheduled to leave Fujian on Saturday." Last night, another telegram was received from the owner of Wanxiang saying, "Wanxiang is scheduled to leave Fujian on Sunday." After receiving the telegram, Sanbei Company knew that Fuzhou was still safe. In view of the congestion of goods, it plans to continue sailing after Wanxiang returns to Shanghai, but it must decide on the policy at that time depending on the situation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Central Government to Quickly Settle Fujian Incident and Telegraphed Jiang and Cai to Urge Them to Seek Mitigation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent two telegrams yesterday, one to the central government and one to Jiang and Cai. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>To Central Government Telegram</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Central Party Headquarters National Government Executive Yuan Jianjian, at the beginning of the Fujian coup, this association had telegraphed to advise, unfortunately, the remonstrance was ignored and it became a separatist situation. At this time of serious foreign trouble, can it be tolerated to see the disintegration again? We urge the central government to quickly make plans and add a quick fix as soon as possible, raising the boil can cause trouble, the opportunity should not be lost, survival depends on today, I dare to contribute and look forward to adoption, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Koutou, Yang,</p>
<h3>To Jiang and Cai Telegram</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Jiang Pacification Director Cai Chairman, Jianjian, the public and others resist the Japanese and labor, praise the population, not to say that the slander of the people, so far, recall the previous action, and then shed tears, if the generation is determined to rely on the Fujian and the sea area, self-convenient private plan, special use of the two public reputation, for the call, under the power of the country, should know self-respect, how to take advantage of this lost path is not far, and seek mitigation, still not lost the sympathy of the people of the country, this association for the country cherish the talent in mind, dare to enter the faithful advice, still hope to choose, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Koutou, Yang,</p>
<h3>More Than Ninety Labor Unions Jointly Signed a Telegram to Request the Punishment of Chen and Li, and Telegraphed to Advise Jiang and Cai Not to Get Involved in the Vortex in Order to Preserve the Past Glory of the 19th Army</h3>
<p>More than ninety labor unions in this city, including the Postal, Fourth District Cigarette, Ninth District Soap and Medicine, Seventh District Cotton Textile, Ship Timber Industry, Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Tea House, First District Shipbuilding, Fifth District Shipbuilding, Dyeing Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Foundry Industry, Sauce Industry, Military Uniform Industry, Postal Service, First District Water and Electricity, Sixth District Water and Electricity, First District Cosmetics, Second District Water and Electricity, Second District Knitting, South Goods Industry, Fifth District Cotton Spinning, Fifth District Cotton Textile, Toothbrush Industry, Garment Industry, Fourth District Silk Reeling, Fourth District Electrical Appliances, Fourth District Water and Electricity, Sixth District Cleaning, Sixth District Public Transportation, Sixth District Tea Making, Tenth District Cotton Spinning, etc., sent two telegrams yesterday, which are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing National Government Junjian, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, etc. used the 19th Route Army to establish illegal organizations in Fujian, colluded with red bandits, poisoned the locality, turned clouds over their hands and rain over their fingers, and were extremely shameless, opened up the opportunity for the Japanese to covet them, and failed the success of the suppression of bandits. It is really a heinous crime, and it is difficult to enumerate them even if you take the hair. If you do not vigorously attack and punish them, how can you declare the discipline and curb the chaos? I implore the Junfu to quickly order the troops to rush to Fujian to punish them severely, so as not to raise the boil and leave trouble, and the spread is difficult to map. It is very fortunate to take the people of Fujian out of the water and fire, and to lay the foundation of the country in the磐石苞桑. Shanghai Postal Labor Union and other more than ninety labor unions simultaneously Koutou, Geng,</p>
<h3>Telegram to Jiang and Cai</h3>
<p>(The title is slightly) Today's China, red bandits are rampant internally, and the Japanese are crowned externally. The country and the nation are as dangerous as stacked eggs. Our central government takes the aim of pacifying the country first, and then resisting foreign aggression, and launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of red bandits. Victory can be expected soon, but Chen Mingshu and others suddenly destroyed the position of the party and the country at this time, cleverly established a name, and took the opportunity to rebel. The bad news came, and it was explored as pain and anger. Regardless of the fact that it is not easy to succeed in gathering reactionaries from all sides who have different dreams in the same bed, even if they want to seek a momentary success by chance, it is only creating opportunities for red bandits. The Zhishi and others have built a national service for the country, and after January 28, "the oath that the guns will never be turned inward is still clearly in people's eyes. Now Chen Mingshu and others are doing the opposite, and it has reached this point, and the pain of Zhishi and others must be more than that of the people of the country. I hope that we will be based on the previous claims, make a magnificent act of expelling the rebels, eliminate the treacherous officials for the party, establish the righteousness for the country, and do not get involved in the whirlpool, risk the lack of justice, and cut off the party and the country, and hope to preserve the glorious history of the 19th Route Army in the past. Under the unified command of the central government, we will work together to suppress bandits and resist the Japanese. The country is very fortunate, and the nation is very fortunate. The telegram is eager to pay attention to it, Shanghai Postal Labor Union and other more than ninety labor unions simultaneously Koutou, Geng,</p>
<h3>Geshe Duoguo Passing Through Shanghai to Return to Tibet</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the venerable Geshe Duoguo from Tibet arrived in Shanghai from Sichuan on the 17th of this month and is currently staying at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road. Yesterday, the reporter visited him. According to him, he is taking the sea route via India to return to Tibet to offer Buddha and practice Dharma in Lhasa. However, he is mindful of the chaos in the world and the rampant desires of the people, which are all caused by the tendency to pursue material things and obscure the true heart, failing to generate the thought of compassion. To avoid the catastrophe, each must develop the original heart, believe in cause and effect, and diligently cultivate the Buddha vehicle in order to expect the world to be at peace. It is heard that the venerable is very eager to return and will set sail soon.</p>
<h3>Changes in French and Japanese Naval Commanders: French Admiral Pissotte Departs Shanghai</h3>
<p>The "Great America Evening News" reports that French Far East Naval Commander Admiral Pissotte, aboard the flagship "Primauguet," departed Shanghai this afternoon (23rd) to visit Taiwan, Hong Kong, Manila, the Dutch East Indies, and other locations before returning to Saigon. There, he will hand over duties to the newly appointed Far East Naval Commander Admiral de Court-Kiñón. Additionally, Japanese naval landing force commander Major General Ueno arrived in Shanghai today aboard the "Shanghai Maru." The outgoing commander, Major General Sugisaka, will return to Tokyo after the handover to report on defense matters before assuming command of the 11th Destroyer Squadron.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Sends Representatives to Beijing to Participate in Five-Province/City Transportation Conference</h3>
<p>The Transportation Committee of the five provinces/cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai recognizes that, with the gradual completion of highways and the development of transportation, it is imperative to deliberate on improving inter-provincial/city joint transportation and road administration police matters. A meeting was specifically scheduled in Beijing on the 23rd. The Shanghai Municipal Government specially dispatched Zhang Dengyi, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Bureau of Public Utilities, to participate. It is reported that Mr. Zhang departed for Beijing by overnight train the night before, carrying important proposals.</p>
<h3>Singapore Strictly Limits the Entry of Overseas Chinese: Imposing an Entry Fee of Five Dollars per Person, and Requiring Both a Landing Permit and an Entry Permit</h3>
<p>A reporter from the "New Singapore News" met yesterday with Mr. Chen, an overseas Chinese just arrived in Shanghai from Singapore. According to him, the total number of Chinese living in Singapore and Penang is approximately two million, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong provinces. They are primarily engaged in the rubber and tin industries. In recent years, their businesses have suffered due to the global economic downturn. In addition, the local authorities implemented a harsh immigration policy in May of this year, severely restricting the entry of overseas Chinese. Any overseas Chinese going to Singapore must have both a landing permit and an entry permit to be allowed entry, in addition to paying an entry fee of five dollars. Otherwise, even with a landing permit but without an entry permit, they will be denied entry. Furthermore, any overseas Chinese residing in the country must report to the authorities every two years. Those who have resided for more than eight years, and have a sufficient guarantor, may obtain a "Residence Permit" to avoid the bi-annual reporting requirement. However, even if an overseas Chinese has resided for eight or ten years, the number of such permits issued is likely to be very limited. Furthermore, the local authorities are particularly strict in monitoring patriotic activities of overseas Chinese, such as holding meetings.</p>
<h3>Three Hundredth Anniversary Memorial Service for Xu Guangqi to be Held Today</h3>

<h3>Shao Lizi Returns to His Ancestral Home Today: Arriving in Shanghai This Morning and Transferring to Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, returned from Southern Shaanxi with Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and arrived in Beijing yesterday.

<h3>Fisheries Authorities Ordered to Close Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that the three regional fisheries administrations have a total monthly operating expense of seven to eight thousand yuan, but have not achieved significant results in terms of fisheries development. The original plan to construct facilities beneficial to fishing has been difficult to realize due to the difficulty in collecting construction fees. Therefore, it has been decided to temporarily suspend parallel organizations such as the Administration Reform Committee and actively allocate the saved funds to construction projects to achieve practical benefits for fisheries. Therefore, the Ministry submitted a request to the Executive Yuan this month to temporarily suspend the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region, Hebei-Shandong Region, and Fujian-Guangdong Region Fisheries Administrations, as well as the Fisheries Improvement Committee and the Construction Fee Collection Office attached to the Improvement Committee. The request was approved at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 21st. The Ministry of Industry specifically instructed the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region Fisheries Bureau yesterday: "As resolved by the Executive Yuan, the Fisheries Administrations of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region, Hebei-Shandong Region, and Fujian-Guangdong Region are all to be suspended. The Bureau is to complete the closure by the end of this month." However, the Ministry's order regarding the Fisheries Improvement Committee, which is directly under the Ministry, has not yet arrived. The Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office has also not received any orders from the Improvement Committee.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Special District Court, Requesting Diligent Handling of the Sanyou Case: Confiscation Due to Inability to Pay Severance Pay is Equivalent to a Major Blow to the National Products Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court yesterday: "To the esteemed court, on the 22nd of this month, we received a letter from Shanghai Sanyou Industrial Company Limited, stating that their Yingxiang Port factory was forced to suspend operations during the January 28th Incident last year, due to being within the Japanese military's sphere of influence. After the ceasefire agreement was reached, the factory was subsequently occupied by the Japanese army for three months, suffering significant damage to buildings, machinery, and equipment. Furthermore, due to the post-war financial stringency and sluggish sales market, the company's working capital was almost exhausted. Credit lines from banks and money shops were cut off, and even the remaining Hangzhou factory was in imminent danger. Consequently, the company's finances were extremely strained, making it impossible to reorganize the Yingxiang factory. The difficult situation was announced to the workers in the newspapers. The company deeply regrets that due to this unfortunate situation, the factory, built upon over twenty years of hard work, was forced to close. However, after the Japanese troops withdrew on May 31st, some workers, misunderstanding the factory's unavoidable situation (their suffering was the same as the workers'), mistakenly believed that the factory intended to take advantage of the situation to abandon the Yingxiang factory and expand the Hangzhou factory. Thus, the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union, taking advantage of a small number of unemployed workers, forcibly broke in and occupied the factory, demanding resumption of operations, leading to disputes. On September 1st of last year, the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee established by the Shanghai Municipal Government rendered an arbitration decision against our company by default. Our company believes that this arbitration decision is clearly unfair in law and practically impossible to implement, and has therefore declared its dissatisfaction and appealed for its annulment. The appeals have been unsuccessful through three trials. Recently, the union has been approved by the Shanghai Local Court to enforce the original arbitration decision, not only forcibly requiring our company to fulfill the impossible obligation of restoring the Yingxiang factory, but also escalating the demands, forcibly seeking to pay a huge amount of severance pay in accordance with the expired labor treatment regulations. Regardless of whether this request is legally baseless, the huge amount of payment is absolutely beyond our company's current financial capacity. Furthermore, upon investigation, the Yingxiang factory originally had over 1,200 workers, of whom two-thirds deeply understand the company's difficulties, the exhaustion of funds, and the impossibility of restoring the Yingxiang factory in the short term. They voluntarily gave up the right to have the factory reopened within the time limit set by the Municipal Government's arbitration and the monthly food allowance before the resumption of work, and are willing to be dismissed in accordance with the current factory law, with one month's severance pay. However, the Shanghai Local Court's enforcement of this case favors the claims of a small number of union members, disregarding the wishes of the majority of workers, exceeding the scope of its authority, forcibly ordering the factory to reopen within a limited time, and continuing to order the payment of food allowances, not only violating the enforcement rules that the government should abide by, but also greatly contradicting the original intention of the Municipal Government's arbitration. (omitted) The Shanghai Local Court has been enforcing this case for several months. Regarding the issue of severance pay, it originally believed that there was no enforcement standard. Now, our company has filed a separate lawsuit to confirm the applicable law, seeking a proper resolution. However, the court has unilaterally complied with the union's demands, transferred a portion of the union's chaotic and incomplete list to the First Special District Local Court for assistance in enforcement, and ordered the payment of 75,000 yuan within ten days, threatening confiscation and auction in default. Our company was shocked upon receiving the order. We want to comply with the order, but we have no funds to pay. If we fail to comply within the deadline, the company will be confiscated. We are truly in a dilemma. After repeated consideration, we can only declare our dissatisfaction and file an appeal within the statutory period to seek a final remedy. We fear that the court will stubbornly stick to its opinion and refuse to suspend enforcement, which would force the closure of our company's surviving Hangzhou factory, with unimaginable consequences. We request your assistance." Upon investigation, since the company has filed an appeal in accordance with the law, the court has a certain procedure to follow, and our chamber has no right to interfere. However, we cannot but worry that the company, which has been built upon decades of hard work and has become a unique highlight in the national products industry, may be confiscated and bankrupted due to its inability to pay the exorbitant severance pay, which is tantamount to a major blow to the national products industry and may have the effect of draining the pond to catch the fish. At a time when various industries are declining and trade deficits are growing year by year, it is necessary to give this matter serious consideration. Therefore, we have specifically prepared this letter to offer our humble opinion, hoping that your esteemed court will handle the case diligently so that both law and reason are served. We offer our respects.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Sends Telegram to the Legislative Yuan, Strongly Arguing for Amendments to the Civil Code: Disputes Over Article 681, Discussing the Registration Law and Sending Representatives to Attend, Telegram from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>"To the esteemed Legislative Yuan in Nanjing: We have recently received a letter from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce stating, 'Regarding the official reply from the Secretariat of the National Government stating that the President has instructed that the Hankou and Changsha Chambers of Commerce have previously submitted requests to amend Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code, which has been forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review and ordered to be handled. We have now received a reply from the Legislative Yuan that the review report has been submitted, and no amendments are necessary. As for partnership organizations, a separate Commercial Registration Law can be formulated as a remedy.' Apart from sending separate replies, we are sending a copy of the original document for your information. Upon investigation, Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code is inconsistent with commercial realities and lacks fairness in legislation. Its implementation is sufficient to completely collapse existing partnership-based businesses. Our previous original submissions have detailed this extensively and have already been attached for your review. We trust that you share our sentiments. We have now received the aforementioned reply, and learned that the Legislative Yuan has rejected the amendment to the original article and only approved the formulation of a separate Commercial Registration Law as a remedy. If it is said to be a 'remedy,' then it is recognized that the article itself has many shortcomings and is not suitable for commercial realities. However, the drafting of the remedial Commercial Registration Law is closely related to that article. Without clear regulations, empty words will be insufficient and the harm will be even greater. The matter was reported at the standing committee meeting on the 17th of last month. All members agreed that the matter was important and that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce should immediately submit a request to the Legislative Yuan, requiring that the highest commercial organization's approval be obtained when discussing this case, in order to provide a remedy, and that separate letters be sent to chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities to strive for a unified effort. Apart from sending separate letters, we are sending a copy of the original document for your federation. Please investigate and promptly submit a document to request the equality of laws and avoid the decline of commerce. We offer our best wishes." Upon investigation, it is evident that Article 681 does not need to be amended, but the partnership organization still requires the remedy of the Commercial Registration Law, indicating that the article is not perfect. The Commercial Registration Law is important to remedy this article and should be widely consulted and investigated to ensure completeness. We hereby submit a telegram to your esteemed Yuan for review. We earnestly request that, when discussing and formulating the Commercial Registration Law, you first instruct the affiliated associations to send representatives to attend the meeting to provide consultation and humble opinions. We await your response with anticipation. Respectfully, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Reply Telegram from the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>"The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan replies to the telegram from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce stating: We are replying to your telegram requesting that the Federation be notified in advance when discussing the Commercial Registration Law so that representatives may be sent to attend for consultation. The President has ordered that it be handled by the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Yuan. Apart from forwarding the matter, we are sending this to you for your information. To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan."</p>

<h3>Director Shen Tests Coal Gas Vehicle: Coal Gas Vehicle is Related to National Economy, the Only Way to Relieve Rural Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Coal Gas Vehicle Manufacturing Company was founded by Xiang Kai of Hunan. Xiang De, a technician from the Hunan Construction Department, serves as the chief engineer. The coal gas vehicle invented by the company uses charcoal instead of gasoline. After testing, ten pounds of domestically produced charcoal can replace one gallon of foreign gasoline. Even with the current low gasoline prices in Shanghai, fuel costs can still be reduced by two-thirds. Last month, the Ministry of Military Affairs dispatched Pan Huang, Section Chief of the Design Section of the Transportation Department, and others to the company for detailed testing, which confirmed the vehicle's perfect construction and suitability for military use. Yesterday (22nd) at 2:00 PM, Director Shen of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works believed that coal gas vehicles are related to the national economy and should be promoted. He test rode the company's coal gas vehicle with various section chiefs and was very satisfied. Then, Lin Ganqing, Director of the Construction Section, personally drove the vehicle, fully loaded with yellow sand, and the driving performance was no different from that of gasoline-powered vehicles. The results were excellent, confirming it as a beneficial tool for economic transportation. It is reported that the Bureau consumes approximately 6,000 yuan of gasoline per month. After completely switching to charcoal fuel in the future, 4,000 yuan can be saved. The 2,000 yuan spent will not be exported to foreign countries but will instead go to rural areas. This is truly the only way to relieve rural decline. It is also reported that Director Huang of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus is strongly promoting this most economical coal gas vehicle. He specifically rented a coal gas vehicle from the company and handed it over to the two railway bureaus' business offices to transport luggage and packages for customers at very low prices, reducing the burden on customers and striving to serve the community.</p>

<h3>Shanghai National Products Company: Implementing the Prelude to the Second Plan: Public Screening of "A History of Blood and Tears in Rehe"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, has experienced rapid business development since implementing its expansion plan on September 1st. The business objectives planned to be completed within six months have already been demonstrated by the facts of the first half of this month (the third month). Therefore, Lu Qisheng, the supporter of the company, decided to implement the second plan as resolved in the one-week anniversary meeting. Chapter 3, Section 1, of Ren Jinping's "National Products Business Development Plan," namely using the means of reforming commercial organizations, shows the fact that national products companies can certainly profit. Now, the purpose of the second plan is to engage in the work of building a manufacturing business alliance in Chapter 4 of the National Products Business Development Plan. During the implementation period of this plan, people who love to buy national products will enjoy high-quality entertainment. It is reported that the company has leased "A History of Blood and Tears in Rehe," filmed amidst gunfire and snow by Zhang Huichong, Ren Xishen, and Erjun, for public screening at the Central Grand Theater. Starting today, anyone who purchases three yuan worth of national products from the company will be given a free ticket, allowing the audience to commemorate Tang Jwjuwu, who died for the nation, and Sun Dianying, who fought fiercely in Chifeng, on the screen. Furthermore, the spirit of the Green Forest hero Lao Beifeng leading the volunteer army and the soldiers' fearlessness of the cold in the snowy mountains are sufficient to understand the strength of the nation and the spirit of revenge of the heroes.</p>
<h3>Haikingberg Circus: Obligatory Performance to Relieve Unemployment</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Haikingberg Circus performed an obligatory two shows at the request of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association. The Relief Association can obtain about three thousand yuan. Now, the circus is also paying attention to the unemployment problem in the city. Shi Huide, the general manager of the circus, announced that all the proceeds from the shows on Tuesday (28th) next week will be donated for the relief of unemployment. Because the circus is of a touring nature and does not reside permanently in Shanghai, this act of righteousness is commendable.</p>
<h3>Lions, Tigers, Black Bears Meet in One Hall, Either Sitting or Standing</h3>
<p>Shi also said that these unemployed people have the same urgent needs, regardless of nationality. It is reported that the list of unemployed people who have hopes of receiving subsidies includes as many as 44 representatives. The funds raised this time will be kept in custody by Major William Darey of the local Salvation Army and the leader of the unemployed registration, who resides at No. 422 Suzhou Road. This gentleman is very enthusiastic about social work and has now agreed to be responsible for the custody and distribution of the funds. The performance time on that day is the same as usual, 5:30 PM and 9:15 PM, with each performance still being 20 acts. Ticket prices remain the same.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South District: The Third Regiment of the Defense Corps Continues to Recruit Members</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Third Regiment of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps was temporarily stationed in the Shanghai South District Defense Corps headquarters in Qiaojia Bang, Xiaonanmen. Now, as winter defense is about to begin, it has moved to Gaochang Si Temple, Fushan Tang Street, outside Dananmen on the 20th of this month. As the number of preparatory volunteer members previously recruited was insufficient, it plans to continue recruiting twenty more members. Anyone who is willing to serve the local community should quickly register at the team's office.</p>
<h3>Creditors of the Riyue Bank Urge the Auction of Huang Chujiu's Estate: Sincere Words, Urgent Need for Funds</h3>
<p>Since the founder Huang Chujiu passed away, the Riyue Bank Dashijie Deposit and Recreation Department, jointly operated by the Gongfa Company, has gone bankrupt, owing more than three million yuan in various deposits. The creditors have hired lawyers to pursue the matter in the former French Concession Court. Two installments of the debts have been repaid, but the remaining debts have not yet been repaid. Now, the creditors, because the Chinese lunar year-end settlement period is approaching and the need for funds is urgent, have specifically commissioned Yan Luqing to submit a statement to the Second Special District Local Court, requesting that Huang Chujiu's estate be auctioned off as soon as possible so that the debts can be repaid earlier. The main points of the statement are as follows: "Requesting the swift auction of Huang Chujiu's real estate to repay debts. Since the case was filed, it has been almost three years, and the poor and helpless creditors have only received two installments from the former French Concession Court. Since this court accepted the case, it has been two years, and not a single cent has been repaid. The writers of the statement previously requested that Huang Chujiu's real estate be auctioned off as soon as possible to repay debts before the year-end settlement period last year, as the need for funds was urgent. More than a year has passed, and we do not know how many times we have written to urge the designated auctioneer to hold the auction quickly. Now, the Chinese lunar year-end settlement period is approaching again, and Huang Chujiu's real estate has still been delayed. It is really incomprehensible. Moreover, Huang's real estate has been mortgaged to others, and the writers of the statement, as ordinary creditors, can only hope for the remainder after the auction price repays the mortgage. The amount of the remainder depends entirely on whether this court's auction method is appropriate, and the date of repayment of the remainder depends on how soon this court holds the auction. We have repeatedly urged the court to hold an auction, but this court has not paid attention to it and approved it, and has delayed it until now. The Chinese lunar year-end settlement period is approaching again, and the auction of real estate will inevitably be affected. We are specifically submitting this statement as the final urging and will not make any more requests that are not answered. After this, we will not make any comments on the timing of the auction and the gains and losses of the auction method, but only ask that this court can take responsibility for itself and decide on a method. The greatest loss for the writers of the statement is that more than eighty percent of the balance cannot be recovered at all. But if this court can wholeheartedly seek the benefit of the writers of the statement, then we will have nothing to say." It is currently reported that the Second Special District Court has announced a date for the auction of all real estate owned by the debtor in this case, and the date of distribution of the funds should not be far away.</p>
<h3>Principal Culprit in Armed Robbery of Xia Family Garden, Guo Hanqing, Confesses to Crime; Two More Accomplices Apprehended</h3>
<p>Guo Hanqing, a notorious bandit (nicknamed "Long-legged Hanqing"), age 30, from Haimen, led more than ten accomplices armed with guns to the home of Qi Zhongshu in the Xia Family Garden in Sujiajiao, western Shanghai, at approximately 1:00 AM on September 14th of this year. They robbed diamond rings, gold watches, and other valuables. Two bandits, Wang Qiusheng and Lu Xiaoheshang, were apprehended on the spot by Tang Bingxiang, a squad leader from the Sixth District Detective Team, and detectives Cao Chuqiao, Zhou Wenhai, Sun Shucheng, Yang Jinzhong, and others. When arresting them at the Shenxin Workshop in Zhoujiaqiao, Guo fled over the rooftops upon hearing the commotion. Only his wife, Guo Chen, and seven accomplices including Zhao Afeng were apprehended. After interrogation, they were sent to the bureau for investigation. Now, Detective Team squad leader Tang Bingxiang and detective Cao Chuqiao and others have discovered that the notorious bandit leader Guo Hanqing is hiding in No. 49 Shenxin Workshop in Zhoujiaqiao. They secretly went to the address at 9:00 PM the night before and apprehended Guo and his accomplices Sun Genfa, Ling Zhenchang, and Jiang Fusheng. They were taken back to the district and interrogated separately by district officials. Guo confessed to organizing the robbery of valuables in the Xia Family Garden to acquire funds for luxurious spending. Sun, Ling, and Jiang all gave evasive answers. The district officials, after obtaining the confessions, ordered them to be temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Notorious Kidnapper Zheng Tangsheng and Others Granted Retrial After Appeal</h3>
<p>In July of this year, the French Concession Police arrested twelve people, including the notorious bandits Geng Huatang, Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, and Wu Shaoting, male and female, in Tianjin for committing multiple serious kidnapping cases. They were brought to Shanghai. Investigations revealed that they had kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the vice president of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, the assistant manager of the Siming Bank, He Shaoting, the owner of the Xinsen Pawnshop, Huang Baohua, a dye merchant, and Ze Lin, the son of Yunnan Division Commander Gu Zizhen, one after another, demanding ransom. They strangled their accomplice Xiao Shaoxing and, in Tianjin, kidnapped Liang Huiwu and Chen Zhuling, compradors of Jardine Matheson, tearing up the tickets and burying the bodies underground to eliminate evidence (the bodies were only discovered after the case was solved). They were sent to the Second Special District District Court, and a public prosecution was initiated against them in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. Zheng Chenshi and Yu Yuanzhou and five others were found to have no suspicion of involvement in the case, so the police did not prosecute them, and they were released by the court first. During the trial period, Geng Huatang committed suicide in the police detention center on October 1st out of fear of punishment. Zheng, Shang, Wu, and the four others were sentenced on October 14th after the trial concluded. They were each sentenced to death for being repeat offenders and assisting in kidnapping for ransom. Details were published in previous reports. The court reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review, but Zheng and the four others were dissatisfied with the original trial verdict. They hired lawyers Zhu Dianqing and Zhu Fuju and others to represent them and submitted a petition to the Provincial Government, stating the reasons for their dissatisfaction and requesting a retrial. The Provincial Government approved the petition. It is now reported that the Provincial Government has returned the original file to the Third Branch of the High Court, which has forwarded it to the original trial court, the Second Special District Court, for a new trial.</p>
<h3>Another "Red Pill" Den Uncovered in Lujiabang, Nanshi; Principal Offender Liu Yumei Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>Huang Zhenxiang, an inspector from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate, recently discovered that Liu Yumei and other hooligans were running a private "red pill" (drug) sales den at No. 26, Lane 57, Sangyuan Street, Lujiabang, outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. They secretly dispatched accomplices to peddle the drugs every day, and even transported large quantities of drugs to other cities. He immediately reported this to Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, who then dispatched a large number of armed police officers from the Police Brigade to the address at around 11:00 AM yesterday. They first surrounded the house and then conducted a search. More than 220 packets of "red pills" were seized on the spot, and Liu Yumei was immediately arrested and taken into custody. She will be sent to the court for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Minor Dispute Over Salary of Former Sailors on the "Hai Shang" Steamer of the Qingdao Line</h3>
<p>The "Hai Shang" steamer of the Qingdao line of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was leased from a Chinese company, had a situation during the tenure of the former comprador where the sailors colluded with the head sailor to smuggle a large quantity of undeclared artificial silk. This was discovered by customs officers of the Jianghai Customs, who imposed a fine of 3,000 taels, which the shipping company was ordered to pay. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, unaware of this beforehand, sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and discovered that the matter was the work of the comprador, the head sailor, and all the sailors on the steamer. Therefore, when the steamer returned to Shanghai on its regular run, the three levels of personnel were all dismissed, and the 3,000 taels of fine were deducted from their salaries. If this was not enough, they were ordered to pay the remaining amount. Meanwhile, a new comprador was appointed, along with new sailors and a new head sailor, and they went to the steamer yesterday morning to take over. At around 11:00 AM, nine former sailors returned to the steamer to demand their salaries from the new comprador. The new comprador stated that the matter occurred during the tenure of the former comprador and did not concern him, leading to a dispute between the two sides. The former sailors refused to leave the ship, and the case was reported to the Sea Patrol Police Station. Detectives Hu Changqing and Liang Shenqing were dispatched, along with four constables, to the steamer to suppress the situation. They ordered the former sailors to seek their salaries from the former head sailor. After saying this, they escorted them ashore, and the small disturbance was quelled. The detectives remained on guard until 2:00 PM, when the steamer raised anchor and left the port, at which point they returned.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Under Economic Pressure: You Lisheng Commits Suicide by Taking a Large Dose of Sedative Water</h3>
<p>You Lisheng, a local resident of No. 441, Third Floor, Siren Lane, Huade Road, in the Public Concession, age 58, worked as a laundryman at the Xinbaohua Laundry nearby. Three days ago, he took an advance of five yuan from the shop and left in a hurry without saying where he was going. Unexpectedly, You went directly to Room 100 of the Dafang Inn on Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen. Due to economic pressure, he suddenly had the idea of dying. At 9:30 PM, he secretly took a large dose of sedative water and committed suicide. The waiter discovered this and sent him to Renji Hospital by cart. The treatment was ineffective, and he died at around 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The body was transferred from the hospital to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await a report to the court for examination.</p>

<h3>Major Cricket Gambling Den Cracked in Fourth Floor of Huaan Bank; Large Sums of Money Involved; Lu Heshang Runs Gambling Operation for Profit; Seventy-Seven People, Including One Woman, Arrested</h3>
<p>A large cricket fighting gambling den was set up in Room 20, Fourth Floor, Huaan Bank, No. 90 Jingxing Lane, Ningbo Road. The person in charge was Lu Heshang. Lu was an expert in this field and gathered enthusiasts every autumn to establish a betting ring (a nickname for the location of the crickets) to entice those with a passion for cricket fighting to wager money. He profited by taking a cut from the winnings. The Huaan Bank room that he rented this year cost a substantial fifty-five yuan per month. The room was quite large, and the interior furnishings were especially complete. All the tools needed for fighting were available. As winter was approaching and the weather was getting colder,</p>
<h3>In Order to Prevent the Autumn Crickets from Freezing to Death,</h3>
<p>the temperature in the battlefield where the crickets were viewed was artificially increased to prolong their lives, so that they would not shrink back in battle. The staffing of personnel was even more organized. Ying Wenkui was the accountant, and Wu Hongjiang and Shen Jingui were responsible for weighing the crickets. This position was quite important, as before the cricket masters brought their crickets to the field for battle, they had to hand over their generals (a nickname for crickets) to the weighers to determine their weight and record it in a ledger. In addition, there were two people in charge of stimulating the crickets with grass. They stood around the battlefield. When the order to engage was given, the cricket masters would each drive two crickets of equal weight into the basin. The basin was rectangular, five inches long and about a foot wide, and was supported by another basin lined with velvet. This basin was filled with boiling water so that the heat would rise, and the crickets would not be afraid of the cold.</p>
<h3>Then They Could Fight Hard.</h3>
<p>However, this arrangement was only suitable for early winter. In autumn, it was not needed at all. Once the crickets entered the arena, the grass handlers challenged them with grass. The crickets then began to fight with each other, and the people watched from the sidelines. After a certain period, a so-called impartial person would order a stop to the battle and announce the victory or defeat. The winner had the joy of receiving a bonus, and the loser suffered the sadness of losing money. The bonus was not fixed. At Lu Heshang's betting ring, one "flower" (a term for a bonus) was equivalent to one silver dollar. Some people bet one dollar, some ten dollars, some even hundreds or thousands of dollars. There were no restrictions. The operator of the ring took a cut of 10%. For example, if the bet was one dollar, the winner would get ninety cents, and the ring operator would get ten cents. Therefore, he hoped that all the cricket masters would be</p>

<p>This way, he could also obtain a great profit. Many wealthy sons of Shanghai, descendants of officials and gentry, had a fondness for cricket fighting. Because the gambling den that Lu operated was elegant and secret, and the sounds of battle were not easily heard outside, people flocked to it day and night. The battles were even more intense on Saturdays and Sundays, and the sums of money involved were huge. Recently, this was discovered by Detective Li Wenbin of the General Patrol Room, who, together with Detective Chief Lu X, Detective Kang Zengxiang, Liu Xiangzhai, Wu Yaozu, and others, rushed to the scene to make arrests the night before. At that time, the battle was in full swing, and the spectators were gathered together. They were all arrested, along with the generals, the fighting equipment, and the "Qi Ying Gong Suo" sign hanging outside the room. They were taken to the patrol room. After questioning their names one by one, they found that there were</p>
<h3>As Many as Seventy-Seven People.</h3>
<p>Among them were many well-known figures in Shanghai, such as the Qiu Lao Jiu group. However, because their reputations were at stake, they all temporarily changed their names to cover up their identities. There was also one woman, Li Chenshi. The head detective allowed 37 of them to be released on bail of 100 yuan each, while the remaining 40 were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District District Court, where Judge Deng Baosun interrogated them. Police lawyer Qian Juju requested that Lu Heshang, Ying Wenkui, Wu Hongjiang, Shen Jingui, and Zhu X (the owner of the top floor) be punished under Article 280 of the Criminal Code, and that the others also be punished according to the law. After Judge Lu's questioning, it was ruled that Ling and the other four would each be sentenced to two months of imprisonment, and the remaining 35 would each be fined 20 yuan. Of the 40 people who were released on bail, only 35 appeared for the trial. They were each fined 50 yuan, and the remaining five were ordered to be summoned for trial at a later date. All the gambling equipment was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Alas, Poverty! A Tragic Case of Separation and Death. A Room That Can Only Hold One Bed Still Owes Seven Months' Rent. Not Even Able to Afford One Full Meal a Day, the Husband Cries and Says Goodbye to His Wife, Who Then Commits Suicide by Taking Poison. Two Heartbreaking Suicide Notes.</h3>
<p>Ying Yuanbing, a native of Ningbo, runs the Yingfu Ji firewood shop at No. 678 Che, West Ma Bridge, Fangbang Road, in the city. Because Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is precious, many frugal people build lofts inside their houses like pigeon cages to rent out to poor people. Ying's shop also has lofts built on top of each other, and each loft is further divided into two rooms. It is clear how cramped and small they are. In August of last year, a man and a woman claiming to be husband and wife came to rent a small room on the third loft. The room was only large enough to accommodate</p>
<h3>One Bed.</h3>
<p>The monthly rent was one yuan and five jiao. However, the couple had only the clothes on their backs and a tattered quilt. The man claimed to be Peng Yiqing, age 37, from Hunan, and said that he was a scholar, but he was idle all day long. The woman, named Liu XingSu, age 33, was from Ningbo. She worked at a cloth factory reeling silk, earning three jiao per day to support the couple. After living there for a while, their true situation was gradually revealed. It was learned that they were living together illicitly and had been for four years. They had been able to live comfortably in the past, but then the man lost his job, and their lives</p>
<h3>Steadily Worsened.</h3>
<p>Eventually, they could no longer afford to live. They pawned off almost all their valuables, leaving only the two of them with nothing. By the summer of this year, they still had a tattered quilt, so the second landlord took pity on them and gave them an old mat. However, in Shanghai, where the cost of living is high, three jiao a day was not enough to support two people. They owed seven months' rent, and from spring to summer, as their clothing decreased, they gave all their cotton-padded clothes to the pawnshop. Now that the cold wind was rising, they lacked clothing to keep warm, and they could not afford one full meal a day. Sometimes they stopped working, which meant going hungry. Peng Yiqing thought that if they continued</p>
<h3>Crying Together Like Cattle in a Shed,</h3>
<p>they would eventually starve to death. Therefore, he decided to make an effort to go out, either to join the army or to find another way to make a living. He bid farewell to the woman a few days ago, saying that they would go their separate ways and find their own lives, and that he would no longer be a burden to her. The scene of separation, with great disaster looming and each flying off in a different direction, was truly heartbreaking. However, the woman became depressed after her husband left. As a poor woman, she felt that the man was even more miserable, so she decided to commit suicide. She went to a fortune-telling stall in front of the Siming Guild Hall on Minguo Road and asked someone to write two suicide notes to the second landlord and her husband.</p>
<h3>Two Suicide Notes.</h3>
<p>Then she bought a few jiao worth of opium and took poison at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 22nd), lying down in the tattered cotton wadding, quietly waiting for death to come. At around 7:00 PM, the second landlord, Ying Yuanbing, learned of this and sent her to Renji Hospital, but it was too late to save her. He died. He then took out the two suicide notes (recorded below) and reported it to the Second District, First Precinct. Yesterday, the eighth neighborhood chief, Hua Dechang, was ordered to report to the District Court for examination. Prosecutor Ouyang and others were commissioned to come to the scene for examination. They ordered the body to be collected and buried by charity.</p>
<h3>Collected Funds for Burial.</h3>
<p>The suicide notes are recorded below: (1) To the Esteemed Second Landlord: I have no other words. I cannot live in this world any longer. But after I die, I hope that you will have compassion and negotiate with the Ningbo Guild Hall for a coffin, so that I can be properly buried. In the afterlife, I will surely repay you. The only good deed is this. I leave this letter respectfully wishing you good luck. Peng XingSu pays respects. (2) To My Husband: May this letter find you well. I am writing to inform you that my body is now very ill and difficult to treat. I am afraid that I will not be long for this world. Therefore, I am writing this letter to inform you that if you have the heart after my death, you can take my coffin back home. At the time of sending this letter, we will not be able to meet in this life. I leave this letter respectfully wishing you good health. Your wife, Liu XingSu. Please receive this letter and forward it to my husband, Peng Yiqing.</p>
<h3>Twins, One Boy and One Girl; Mother Revives from Near-Death; All Three Are Well.</h3>
<p>Chen, the wife of a Mr. Ji who works for the police and lives at No. 776 Zhoujiazui Road, was pregnant for a full term, and her abdomen was very swollen. Suddenly, a few days ago, she experienced severe abdominal pain and called a midwife to assist with the delivery. After waiting for three or four days, she finally gave birth to a boy. The woman was obese, and her abdomen remained swollen as before. Just as the midwife was about to clamp and remove the placenta, the pregnant woman fainted due to extreme pain. A female doctor from the Hongkou Civilian Obstetrics Hospital was called for consultation. She knew that there was still a fetus in the abdomen, but because there was excessive bleeding, she immediately injected a five-thousand-fold solution of saline. The pregnant woman celebrated her rebirth and then underwent surgery to remove a female fetus. The child was blue all over, and the family was frightened and ran away. Now, the pregnant woman and her children are all well. It is said that having twins, one boy and one girl, is a very rare occurrence.</p>
<h3>Murder Case at the Central Apartment; Male Guest Never Returns; Female Guest Strangled to Death in Bed.</h3>
<p>At the Central Apartment, No. 276, Route Cardinal Foch, two guests, a man and a woman, checked in at 11:00 PM the night before (the 22nd). The man claimed to be Zhang Sen, age 42, from Nanjing, and said that he was a farmer. The woman was his wife, Wang, age 34, also from Nanjing. They said that they had just arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing to find work. Their luggage was still at the North Railway Station and that they would pick it up the next morning. The apartment clerk ordered the waiter to lead them to Room 6 on the second floor. At 7:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhang got up first and went out, telling the waiter that he was going to the North Railway Station to pick up his luggage and that he would be back soon. The waiter and others thought it was a common occurrence and did not suspect anything. At lunch time, 11:00 AM, he still had not returned, and Ms. Wang was still fast asleep. The waiter, Pan Jiawu (age 39, from Nanjing), went upstairs and entered the room to ask if she wanted lunch. He saw her still lying in bed, not responding. He was surprised and lifted the curtain to look at her. Unexpectedly, she had been strangled to death by Zhang with a thin white belt, which was still around her neck. Her clothes were not removed. The waiter was shocked and told the clerk, Chen Shouting (age 53, from Nanjing). Because Zhang was familiar and often stayed at the apartment, they first sent someone to search for Zhang in all directions at the North Station, but there was no trace of him. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they reported it to the Songshan Road Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The female corpse was of medium height, with a round face, wearing a short white-bottomed blue silk shirt, a black woolen lined jacket, a flowered cotton jacket, a bluish-gray silk vest, a woolen sweater, striped cloth trousers, and a tan Western-style lined trousers. She was bald with some hair, small bound feet, wearing light red woolen socks and small checkered wool shoes. She had two silver rings on her ring fingers, and there were six jiao in coins in her pocket. There was nothing else. There were no relatives of the deceased in Shanghai. The corpse was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Examination Office. The police photographed the corpse and waited to report to the Second Special District Court today for the assignment of personnel for examination. Meanwhile, the police ordered all detectives to strictly apprehend the fleeing murderer for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Beihai Chamber of Commerce and Others Send Representatives to Beijing Again to Petition About the Confiscation of Local Sugar; Send Telegrams to All Sectors Requesting Assistance.</h3>
<p>Regarding the local sugarcane sugar produced in Beihai, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou in South China, the sugar merchants from those areas transported it to Shanghai, reported it to the Beihai Customs for inspection, and paid the unified tax. The original ships then loaded it onto Shanghai. After arriving at the port, it was re-examined by the Jianghai Customs. Because the local sugar was mixed with foreign sugar, the tax paid was not in accordance with the regulations. The Customs Administration detained the local sugar in question. There were a total of five detentions, and a total of 1,560 yuan in fines and 1,957 yuan in supplementary taxes were paid. The Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Qinzhou-Lianzhou Sugar Industry Association, and others believe that the Jianghai Customs is arbitrarily undermining the sugar merchants and that its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is extremely serious. Therefore, they appealed to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and other groups. The Qiongzhou sugar merchants appointed Mr. Xing Juefei as their representative to petition in Beijing. However, there have been no results to date. The Sugar Industry Association is aware that amid the current rural bankruptcy, if difficulties are created for them again, it will make it impossible for sugar merchants to survive. Therefore, they have again appointed Mr. Pang Songfei to petition the competent authorities in Beijing and to submit four opinions for adoption. At the same time, they have sent telegrams to all sectors requesting assistance. The full text of the telegram is recorded below.</p>
<p>"We believe that Beihai is an important port for the export of local sugar in South China. Local sugar produced in Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, Leizhou in Guangdong, and Yulin, Bobai, and other cities in Guangxi is exported through Beihai. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the annual export volume was no less than hundreds of thousands of dan. Since the dumping of foreign sugar, the local sugar industry has plummeted, sugarcane fields have been abandoned, sugar mills have been closed, and exports have almost disappeared. Local people generally believe that the central issue of rescuing rural areas is. Fortunately, last year, the government heavily taxed foreign sugar to prevent its dumping. Beihai local sugar is expected to recover from this and slightly revive its vitality. It is estimated that since last year, the export of local sugar has increased from more than 5,000 dan to more than 30,000 dan. If given time and encouragement, it will not be difficult to restore its original hardship. Who knows that hope is contrary to reality? Just when Qinzhou, Lianzhou, and other places are trying to revitalize the sugar industry, there is a sudden move by the Jianghai Customs to detain local sugar from Heli Heng, Helong Guangchang, and Heheyi, and the bad news spread, which is very shocking. The reason is that from July to September of this year, sugar merchants Heli and others transported local white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai a total of five times. All were reported to the Beihai Customs for inspection, and it was confirmed that it was pure local sugar, and taxes were paid in accordance with the regulations before it was released. Unexpectedly, when it arrived in Shanghai, it was completely detained by the Jianghai Customs Commissioner, claiming that it contained 10% to 20% foreign sugar, and a total of 1,560 yuan in fines and 1,957 yuan in supplementary taxes were imposed. The method used to distinguish local sugar from foreign sugar was initially based on the level of the optical rotation, saying that local sugar was below 93 degrees of optical rotation, while foreign sugar was above 93 degrees. Later, it was said that foreign sugar has hard crystals and a luster, while local sugar does not. It is not known that the optical rotation can only measure the quality of the sugar, but the quality of the sugar varies depending on the ingredients and manufacturing methods. It varies from time to time and from place to place. How can we generalize other sugars based on the sugar of one time and place? At the same time, sugarcane sugar, whether imported or local, has crystals and a luster, and those who are slightly common can say it. However, due to different manufacturing methods, the quality also varies from time to time, and it cannot be arbitrarily determined to be absolutely absent. The Jianghai Customs's erroneous inspection has long been criticized by public opinion, so I will not repeat it. Here, I will only talk about the special circumstances of the export of Beihai local sugar. The Qinzhou and Lianzhou areas are rich in sugarcane sugar, and foreign sugar has rarely been imported. There is a small retail sale on the market, only No. 24 coarse sand white, and the price is twice as expensive as the local superior white. Merchants transport goods for the purpose of selling them expensively. How can they be more expensive than cheap, and make a profit for themselves? Therefore, it is still possible to say that local sugar is impersonating foreign sugar, but it is not allowed to mix foreign sugar in local sugar. This is in terms of business principles. It should be requested to correct the erroneous inspection of the Jianghai Customs. Coastal Qinzhou and Lianzhou have Guanbian, and foreign sugar must pay import duties. According to the current tax, after foreign goods have paid import duties, they can be transferred from Port A to Port B without paying transit duties. In this case, even if Beihai sugar merchants transport foreign sugar to Shanghai, they should directly report the transit of foreign sugar. How can they mix it in local sugar and take a heavy tax on themselves? This is in terms of tax regulations. It should be requested to stop the Jianghai Customs from creating difficulties in paying supplementary taxes 2. The Beihai Customs is close to the sugar-producing area. The composition and composition of local sugar and the difference from foreign sugar are more accurate. Therefore, Beihai sugar merchants have reported the export of local sugar in the past, and they have been inspected and released without misunderstandings and difficulties. Unexpectedly, the original Zhuang Jing was transported to Shanghai, and the Jianghai Customs pointed out that it was mixed with foreign sugar and fined it. If it is not deliberately destroying local products and speaking for economic invaders, who will believe it? The Jianghai Customs and the Beihai Customs are both national taxation agencies, and they follow the same tax system. If the local sugar transported from the north to Shanghai is mixed with foreign sugar and should be punished, the Beihai Customs should implement it immediately after the inspection in the first place. How can it be indulgent and then capture it, waiting for the Shanghai Customs? This is in terms of tax administration. It should be requested to stop the Jianghai Customs from confiscating the confiscation 3. Since the case of the alleged punishment of local sugar, sugar merchants have stopped transporting sugar mills and the market has suffered losses. The rural areas have been greatly affected. The Chamber of Commerce, the Sugar Industry Association, and others are closely related to the interests. Therefore, we specially convened all the sugar merchants to discuss relief measures, and a total of four items were discussed and decided: (1) Please ask the Ministry of Finance to correct the erroneous method of the Jianghai Customs to distinguish between local sugar and foreign sugar. (2) Please ask the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs to release the local sugar from Beihai sugar merchants and return the past fines and supplementary taxes. (3) Please ask the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to inform all customs in the country to protect the safety of local sugar imports and exports and not to deliberately create difficulties. (4) Please ask the central government to issue a clear order to exempt local sugar from export and transit taxes, and to formulate measures to encourage local sugar exports. After unanimous approval, in addition to publicly recommending representatives to petition in Beijing, we especially send telegrams to state the truth. We hope that the officials of the authorities will adopt and implement the above four items as much as possible, and that the compatriots from all walks of life will uphold justice and assist us, so that this case can be thoroughly resolved as soon as possible. To leave a business for the sugar merchants is to leave a lifeline for the rural areas. The telegram is infinitely grateful and awaits orders. Guangdong Hepu County Chamber of Commerce, Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Qinzhou and Lianzhou Sugar Industry Guangyitang and all sugar merchants kowtow and seal,</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin-Pukou Southern Section Increases the Number of Joint Transportation Freight Cars; Four Trains Operate Up and Down Each Day to Clear Accumulated Goods on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that there is a large amount of accumulated joint transportation goods on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, which urgently needs to be cleared. It recently convened relevant personnel from the Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways in Beijing to discuss ways to clear the goods. The two railway administrations sent Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Traffic Department; Xie Wenlong, Deputy Director; Wang Zhigang, Chief of the Transportation Section; Li Jingwei, Director; Xu Chaoyuan, Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai Line Traffic Section; Wang Bi, Director of the Mechanical Department; Min Xiaowei, Engineer of the Nanjing Mechanical Section; and others to participate. At the meeting, Yu, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry, presided over the meeting. Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Traffic Department of the two railway administrations, reported the results of the meeting to the Railway Administration. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency recorded the details as follows:</p>
<h3>General Assembly Resolves to Coordinate Vehicles</h3>
<p>The General Assembly, noting the surplus of locomotives on the Jinpu Railway and the surplus of freight cars on this railway, sought a way to coordinate and utilize them mutually. It was decided that this railway would lease freight cars to Jinpu, and Jinpu would lease locomotives to this railway. (C) Regarding leased vehicles, the General Assembly proposed: (1) one freight train to run between Bengbu and Shanghai in each direction; (2) one freight train to run between Bengbu and Changzhou/Wuxi in each direction; (3) one freight train to run between Xuzhou and Shanghai in each direction; (4) one freight train to run between Dawenkou and Shanghai in each direction; (5) one freight train to run between Tengxian/Linhuaiguan and Shanghai in each direction. Each of the above routes would make a round trip every four days, requiring a total of twenty trains, allowing for turnover. Jinpu and this railway would each provide ten sets of cars. After repeated representations by the attending personnel from this bureau about the difficulty with vehicle availability, the final resolution was: this railway would provide three trains. If freight traffic is light along the line of this railway, the number would be increased to four or five, or provided to the greatest extent possible. (B) Regarding leased locomotives, it was resolved that the Jinpu Railway would lease three locomotives to this railway. (C) Regarding rental fees, all rental fees for locomotives and vehicles between Jinpu and this railway would be handled according to the provisions of the Joint Transportation Regulations. (D) Regarding trains crossing the river, the ferry is currently unable to operate at night, with only four round trips per day. Given the high frequency of trains between Xupu, Nanjing and Shanghai, it is quite difficult to increase the number of freight trains crossing the river. It was resolved that relevant personnel from Jinpu and this railway would remain in Nanjing, together with commissioners appointed by the Ministry, to formulate schedules for the four trains and river crossing times. The personnel from this bureau remaining in Nanjing are Wang Zhigang, Chief of the Transportation Section, and Li Jingwei, Director.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Orders Increase in Freight Trains</h3>
<p>Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu telegraphed: 京滬路局 [Jinghu Railway Bureau] be advised. Upon investigating, it has been found that over 40,000 tons of goods for responsible joint transportation are stockpiled along the Jinpu Railway. Urgent measures should be taken to expedite their transport. I have already convened a meeting at the Ministry with responsible personnel from the railway and the Jinpu Railway, and it has been decided that there is a relatively large amount of freight from Dawenkou, Tengxian, and Xuzhou to Shanghai, and from Linhuai, Bengbu to Shanghai, Wuxi, or Changzhou. One direct joint transportation freight train should be run daily in each direction (northbound and southbound), respectively. (A) Southbound Xuzhou to Shanghai, scheduled to depart Xuzhou at 16:00, cross the river at 13:20, and arrive in Shanghai at 11:10. Northbound Shanghai to Xuzhou, scheduled to depart Shanghai at 17:20, cross the river at 11:50, and arrive in Xuzhou at 5:08. (B) Southbound Dawenkou to Shanghai, scheduled to depart Dawenkou at 5:55, cross the river at 10:30, and arrive in Shanghai at 6:40. Northbound Shanghai to Dawenkou, scheduled to depart Shanghai at 19:00, cross the river at 14:30, and arrive in Dawenkou at 9:00. (C) Southbound Bengbu to Shanghai, scheduled to depart Bengbu at 16:55, cross the river at 7:30, and arrive in Shanghai at 6:00. Northbound Shanghai to Bengbu, scheduled to depart Shanghai at 21:55, cross the river at 17:30, and arrive in Bengbu at 3:50. (D) Southbound Bengbu to Wuxi, scheduled to depart Bengbu at 4:00, cross the river at 18:40, and arrive in Wuxi at 8:00. If there is not much freight for Wuxi, the train should proceed to Changzhou. Northbound Wuxi to Bengbu, scheduled to depart Wuxi at 21:00, cross the river at 6:00, and arrive in Bengbu at 19:00. All should be approved and implemented accordingly. However, regarding item (D), the river crossing times are relatively early or late. In addition to instructing the Jinpu Railway to immediately increase the number of employees in the ferry section, and ordering the Capital Railway Ferry Engineering Office to expedite the installation of lighting, the Railway should prepare and implement on another fixed date. Item (C) is scheduled to begin operations on the 18th of this month. Item (A) is scheduled to begin operations on the 25th of this month. Item (B) is scheduled to begin operations on December 1st. For the sake of meeting urgent needs for items (A) and (B), efforts should still be made to find ways to begin operations earlier. As for each of the freight trains mentioned above, attach eighteen 40-ton tarpaulin-covered wagons. If the Jinpu Railway has sufficient locomotive power, it should transport other joint transportation or local freight as much as possible. You are all instructed to comply, quickly prepare for implementation, and must not delay. Furthermore, you are to report the transportation situation to the Ministry in a timely manner. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Commemorating the 300th Anniversary of Xu Guangqi's Death by Chen Binhe</h3>
<p>Everything in the world has its constants and changes, and one must deal with them with principles and adaptability. Maintaining the constant and going with the flow is something that ordinary people can do. However, dealing with changes and exercising discretion requires the wisdom and foresight of a sage. The late Ming Dynasty had a profound impact on the survival of our nation and the rise and fall of our culture, including the successive invasions of the Japanese and Manchus, and the introduction of Western learning by the missionary Matteo Ricci. At that time, the officials and people in the court and in the countryside, lacking foresight and vision, were ignorant and unable to cope with the former, and were complacent and deeply closed off to the latter. This not only brewed a hatred of religion but also almost blocked the import of scientific culture. At this time, there was someone who had great vision, understood the situation of the outside world, repeatedly submitted strategies for defending the border and consolidating the country, strove to protect the devastated religious difficulties, revitalized the national spirit, and promoted scientific culture, making contributions to awakening the world and improving the people, supporting the declining and reviving the broken. This was none other than our Xu Guangqi.</p>
<p>Xu, courtesy name Zixian, pseudonym Xuanhu, was a famous official of the late Ming Dynasty. A native of Shanghai, he rose to the position of Grand Secretary of the Inner Cabinet. His career and writings were brilliant at the time, and he was admired and praised by later generations. He was truly an outstanding talent of his generation. His works include several volumes of memorials, commentaries on the classics, poetry, "Xu's Culinary Sayings," "Western Methods of Calendar Calculation," and "Complete Treatise on Agriculture," totaling more than 200 volumes. Some have been circulated, some are kept at home, and some have been engraved but destroyed. What remains today is but a tiny fraction, as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Now, I will select the major points concerning the protection of religion and the transmission of the faith, as well as politics, economy, science, culture, and national thought, and present them here to express my admiration for the former sages and to inspire future generations to follow their path. Xu was baptized in 1603 and upheld and promoted the teachings of the Catholic Church for thirty years. When Matteo Ricci first came to China in the 15th century, 20 years before Xu's baptism, the Ming court was still closed off. Westerners who came to China were regarded with suspicion. In order to avoid attracting attention, Ricci followed local customs, calling himself a Western monk and wearing monastic robes. However, at that time, monks were unlearned and ignorant, and were deeply despised by the people. Confucianism alone was highly respected, so Ricci changed into Confucian robes, called himself a Western Confucian scholar, and explored Confucianism in order to interact with famous people. For a long time, the propagation of religion did not make much progress. Later, he tried to offer his scientific knowledge as much as possible and traveled to Beijing and Guangzhou, hoping to reach the knowledge of the court. Although he had changed the public's view of foreigners and won the admiration of the scholar-officials of the time, he still did not achieve the desired effect in propagating religion. After Xu's baptism, he gave powerful support, increasing people's faith, and Catholicism began to sow its good seeds in China. However, when virtue is high, troubles come. In a few years, the gentry and people of Beijing and its surrounding areas spread rumors that Catholicism was similar to the White Lotus Sect, bewitching the people and endangering the country. Shen Que repeatedly submitted memorials denouncing the "distant barbarians," his words sharp and aggressive, and his determination to oppose the Church was evident on paper. Later, after Xu Guangqi submitted memorials to defend the Church and was willing to guarantee with his life and family, the storm temporarily subsided. Later, because Shen Que was in power and there were official-led popular rebellions in Shandong, the officials regarded them as White Lotus Sect rebels. Shen Que's party took the opportunity to falsely accuse Catholicism as being the same as the White Lotus Sect, and arrested Catholics everywhere, and the religious persecution was renewed. Xu again repeatedly wrote letters to protect the Church and sent letters to friendly officials, upholding justice. This fledgling Chinese Catholic Church was thus preserved, and it soon began to flourish. History says that "scholar-officials such as Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao admired his teachings and embellished his writings, so his religion suddenly flourished." This can be taken as powerful evidence of Xu's protection of the Church in those days. As for Xu's unique and insightful study of the teachings and his zealous propagation of the faith, one only needs to look at the flourishing of Catholicism today. When drinking water, we should not forget the source.</p>
<p>Xu Guangqi's political and economic views can be summarized as follows: In internal affairs, he emphasized agriculture and financial management; in foreign affairs, he emphasized securing the borders and defending against the barbarians, and using trade to quell unrest. All of these addressed the shortcomings of the time and could have brought great benefits to the country and the people. As he said to Chen Zilong, "From now on, what the country suffers from is poverty, and bandits are not easy to suppress. The people of the Central Plains have not cultivated for a long time. People who do not cultivate are easy to commit crimes and difficult to be good." Chen Zilong supplemented and deleted Xu's "Complete Treatise on Agriculture," and also praised him, saying, "What he learned in his life was extensive and thorough, and he focused on practical application. As for agriculture, he especially put his heart into it, believing that the source of the people's food and clothing, and the foundation of the country's wealth and strength, all depend on agriculture. Therefore, he personally held the plow, personally tasted the flavors of plants and trees, and collected and compiled the book." His water management policies were also related to the emphasis on agriculture, which further shows that Xu was pragmatic. In his posthumous writings, the plans in the "Land Reclamation" section are well-organized, and all of them are derived from practical experience. The great plan of people's livelihood and the promotion of political power all depend on the financial situation. Xu had a memorial on military farms, which was a method of increasing revenue. The memorial was divided into five parts: first, land reclamation, suggesting that land should be reclaimed to the east of the capital, along the coast for thousands of miles, from the northernmost Liaohai to the southern coast of Qingqi, according to law, which could provide sufficient food; second, water conservancy, distinguishing rivers, and digging wells and ponds, so that highlands and plains could be free from drought; third, locust control, listing the methods of locust control from ancient times to the present, all of which are practical and feasible; fourth, prohibiting private salt, saying that salt laws are all ruined by officials, and if private sales are to be prohibited, the officials in charge of salt must be greatly reformed; fifth, the sun-drying method of salt production is better than the boiling method. In the late Ming Dynasty, foreign troubles, Japanese pirates and Manchus, came one after another. Xu's overall plan for national defense is detailed in the memorials "Pacifying and Defending against the Barbarians," "The Strategy to Defeat the Enemy is Very Easy and Very Close," "Soldiers are Difficult to Fight and Defend if They are Not Selected and Trained," and "Regulations for City Defense." He knew the enemy and himself, and he was able to cut to the core in his strategies for attack and defense. As for the counter-measures to pacify the Japanese, control the Japanese, and plan for the Japanese, he only needed to comply with the Japanese conditions, and sell silk, weapons, and medicines to their country, in order to satisfy their only desire to plunder the border. From then on, unrest would be suppressed and financial resources would be opened up, killing two birds with one stone, which can be said to be well-planned and carefully considered. At that time, the Manchus were rising in power, and the Japanese threat was pressing. Xu was also eager to train soldiers, manufacture weapons, store talent, and work diligently for the country, all in order to resist the invasion of foreign tribes and revitalize our Han people. In 1619, the Ming Dynasty fought with the Manchus and suffered four defeats. Xu Guangqi said that the reason why the "rebellious slaves" had won repeatedly but had not been able to go deep into the interior was because "behind them there was the Northern Pass, and in front of them there was Korea," knowing that it was necessary to protect Korea at that time, so that it could be a powerful shield for us. He did not hesitate to overcome difficulties and submitted a memorial to request to personally oversee the protection of Korea. His patriotism and protection of the nation were overflowing in his words, and his loyalty and integrity were admirable.</p>
<p>Xu's introduction of Western learning and his thorough research in science are unforgettable in the history of Chinese culture. Old Chinese scientific knowledge, such as astronomy, calendar calculation, geography, and technology, was mostly written by private individuals and kept secret, without any organized system or reliable scientific basis. For example, the failure to predict the solar eclipse on January 5, 1610, led Xu to submit a memorial to request the revision of the calendar based on what he had learned, but the Bureau of Astronomy refused to accept it. Later, on July 27, 1629, the Ministry of Rites again failed to predict the solar eclipse, and the emperor ordered Xu to revise it together with the priests. It can be seen that the so-called true science began to see the light of day from then on. Xu also got in touch with Western European academic centers, such as the Roman College, the University of Montpellier, and the universities of Germany and Austria, through the introduction of Matteo Ricci, and drew new knowledge to be poured into China. He selected the most famous Western European science books, such as "Elements of Geometry," "Water Engineering," "Firearms," "Astronomy," and "Geography," and translated them into Chinese. Liang Qichao called Xu "profoundly cultivated in mathematics, astronomy, and logic, and wrote many books." He also presented the translated version of "Elements of Geometry" and praised it as "the first-class work in the translation field from ancient to modern times." The "Siku Quanshu" also praised his translation as "clear in sentence and meaning, and it is no exaggeration to say that it is the crowning achievement of Western learning. It is sufficient to prove that Xu Guangqi was the pioneer of importing Western learning and the forerunner of modern Chinese culture."</p>
<p>In conclusion, Xu Guangqi's perseverance in protecting and propagating religion, and his loyalty and diligence in assisting the Ming Dynasty, have been shining brightly in the world since ancient times. His spirit of revitalizing national thought and his great achievements in promoting science and culture are even more worthy of our admiration. As we are now in a time when the Northeast is lost and the country is in dire straits, commemorating this great figure of the Ming Dynasty and the pioneer in the modern cultural history of China, how should we be inspired and strive to carry on the heroic spirit of our ancestors in resisting foreign aggression, and saving the country with science, in order to promote and carry forward the spirit?</p>

<h3>Explanation of the Functions of the National Military Training Commission by the Training Department and the Ministry of Education; Order from the Ministry of Education to the Jiangsu Education Bureau and the Shanghai Education Bureau to Comply</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 23rd) Regarding the issue of the powers of the Jiangsu Education Bureau to guide provincial military education by the National Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Education requested instructions via telegram. After consulting with the Training Supervisory Department, the ministry replied, stating that the establishment of the National Military Training Commissions in various provinces and cities is to handle military education in schools in various provinces and cities, as well as military education for citizens outside of schools. Their duties are specialized in military training, and the governing bodies are clearly defined in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. When the commission corresponds with the education bureaus, the terms "consult" and "present" as stipulated in Article 16 of the original detailed rules are extremely appropriate. However, since the current official document format no longer uses "consult" and "present," it should be amended and temporarily changed to "present" to conform to the format. In order to take into consideration the responsibility of the education bureau for education in the entire province or city and to ensure the uniformity of the educational administrative system, Article 4, Section 1 of the Provisional Regulations and the items listed in Article 4 of the detailed rules can be presented by the commission to the education bureau for implementation via the education bureau's order. Furthermore, official documents issued by the commission should be signed by the chairman of the commission in order to assign responsibility, etc. The Ministry of Education has now ordered the Jiangsu Education Bureau and the Shanghai Education Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Education Bureau Prepares for the Spring High School Graduation Examination and Decides to Hold it in Three Regions in February Next Year</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) As the spring high school graduation examination is approaching next year, the Guangdong Education Bureau has recently started preparations. It has been found that there are a total of 77 middle schools in Guangdong Province, with a total of 3,762 graduating students. Among them, 102 are students in the senior high school general course, 28 are students in the senior high school normal course, and the rest are junior high school students. As a first step in preparation, the Education Bureau established an examination committee, appointing 15 examination committee members, with Xie Yingzhou as the chairman of the committee. After a meeting, it was decided that the spring high school graduation examination for the year 1934 would be held on February 1st and 2nd next year. The examination areas are divided into three: 1. Guangzhou area, 2. Shantou area, and 3. Haikou area (the names of the counties included in each area are omitted). All middle schools in the province were ordered to rush to create registration tables for the spring graduating students and submit them to the Education Bureau two months before the examination for processing. The examination papers will be prepared by the Education Bureau and distributed to the examination sites at the appointed time. The subjects for the junior high school examination are temporarily set as Party Principles, Chinese Language, Self-Study, History and Geography, Natural History, Physics and Chemistry, English, or German. The subjects for the senior high school general course are Party Principles, Chinese Language, Mathematics, History and Geography, or Physics, Chemistry and Biology, English, or German. The subjects for the senior high school normal course are Party Principles, Chinese Language, Mathematics, Biology, Introduction to Education, Educational Law, and Elementary School Administration. Students who pass all subjects in the examination will be allowed to graduate. Those who fail one subject will be allowed to retake the exam once. Those who fail three subjects will stay at school for remedial study and participate in the next examination. The overall grade for each student in the examination will be determined by the average score of all subjects. The grade for the school will be determined by the average score of all students participating in the examination. The examination procedures will be determined and implemented by the Examination Committee. The Examination Regulations, the Outline of the Examination Committee Organization, and the Detailed Rules for the Examination Committee have also been revised and approved in meetings.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai's Remarks Regarding Provincial Middle School Funding</h3>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper noticed an article in another publication by a certain gentleman discussing the abuses in the revenue and expenditure of funds for provincial middle schools in Jiangsu Province. Eager to clarify the truth, the reporter visited Director Zhou of the Education Department. Director Zhou graciously provided a detailed response, which is recorded below. I (Zhou referring to himself, similarly hereinafter) returned from an inspection in northern Jiangsu and happened to see an article in the newspaper criticizing the expenditure of funds for middle schools in Jiangsu Province. The criticism was vague and generalized, making it difficult to understand the specific points being made. Since assuming my position in Jiangsu, I have always adopted a strict approach to the finances of subordinate organizations. Therefore, I have established strict procedures for the public disclosure of funds for all educational institutions, as well as for the auditing and supervision of revenues and expenditures. These procedures have been promulgated and are being diligently implemented. The funds managed by provincial schools include regular and temporary expenses, as well as funds collected from students and funds managed on behalf of students. The reimbursement of regular and temporary expenses is subject to strict auditing procedures, and starting this year, a deadline for reporting has been set to ensure thorough review. As for the various fees collected from students, the types and amounts are specifically defined. The actual revenue and expenditure are also required to be kept in separate accounts, which are submitted for verification on a regular basis, to avoid confusion with regular revenue and expenditure. In addition, administrative revenue management regulations and public reserve fund management regulations have been established. The revenue and expenditure of production income, school property income, surplus from meal fees, interest income, miscellaneous fee surpluses, and other off-budget income are all subject to strict regulations and supervision. In August of this year, instructions were also publicly issued to all educational institutions regarding the points to be noted by the accounting departments. These instructions specifically stipulated that all funds should be deposited in the name of the institution, and not in the name of private individuals. Therefore, all types of funds within provincial schools are subject to the audit and supervision of the Education Department. I also dispatch personnel from time to time to conduct secret investigations for evaluation purposes. The legislation is thorough, and the auditing is earnest. Those who are unaware of the truth may make speculative remarks, which are often inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Sports: Shanghai Women's Basketball Association Championship Final: Liangjiang Defeats Southeast to Retain the Championship (22-35); Both Sides Performed Well and the Competition was Fierce; Southeast Lost Due to Lack of Experience; Three More Games Tonight</h3>
<p>The Liangjiang women's basketball team defeated Southeast last night by a score of 35 to 22, retaining the Shanghai Women's Basketball Championship. The China Basketball Hall was packed with spectators, making it the first grand occasion of this season's women's basketball game. Both teams performed well, and Liangjiang's Chen Rongming was particularly outstanding. Southeast's forward Liu Wenhua's excessive calmness and the failure of cooperation with Ms. Ren Zhu were a significant disadvantage. The whole team's formation and movements were slow and occasionally frantic. This was due to a lack of experience. The Liangjiang team has a long history, is experienced, and is orderly in its advance and retreat without any confusion. There was also a B-group game last night, in which Qiangdong defeated Shangzhong by a score of 80 to 1.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in the First Quarter</h3>
<p>As soon as the game between Qiangdong and Shangzhong ended, the甲group final between Southeast and Liangjiang continued. The students of both teams greeted each other with applause. As the fierce battle began, Southeast made a valiant effort, pouncing on Liangjiang's defense. Ren Shu and Liu Wenhua missed opportunities one after another, and the spectators were disappointed. Then, Liao Zhuyuan scored first, and shouts erupted that were deafening. Liangjiang made every effort to guard, courageously retaliating. Yang Sen scored under the basket unexpectedly. Southeast's Ren Shu missed a free throw, but Liu Wenhua caught the shot and added two points. Liangjiang was unwilling to be outdone and responded in kind. Chen Rongming tied the score. Yang Sen scored a long shot, and the score suddenly exceeded. Liao Zhuyuan added one point, and Chen Yang scored four more points. Liangjiang took the lead 10-5. Southeast called a timeout but did not improve. Pan Meng scored again, and Liu Wenhua returned the favor. Liangjiang was ahead 12-7 in the first quarter.</p>
<h3>Southeast Could Not Support Itself in the Second Quarter</h3>
<p>The situation in the second quarter was quite chaotic for Southeast. The forward's passes were ineffective and could not break through Liangjiang's defense. Therefore, Liangjiang had more offensive opportunities and achieved many successes. Yang Sen made the first free throw, and Southeast's Liao Zhuyuan added three points. After that, Southeast was trapped in strict defense and found it difficult to attack. Liangjiang was more active, and Yang Sen scored again and again. The situation seemed to be leaning to one side. Liangjiang scored nine points in this quarter, and Southeast scored three points, for a total of 21-11, a difference of ten points. This was the situation in the first half.</p>
<h3>Section Three: Stalemate</h3>
<p>Southeast rapidly chased and caught up, striving to avenge the defeat. Both Jiangnan took advantage of their victory, their momentum remained strong. The competition between the two sides became increasingly intense. They fought for every point, neither side willing to show weakness. Chen Rongming of Jiangnan was fierce like a man, making one free throw out of one, then adding three points. After Ren Shu of Southeast returned a basket, Chen scored another three points. Southeast was behind by as many as fourteen points but did not lose heart at all. Liu Wenhua also made a basket for Southeast. After Chen Rongming added another two points, Liao Zhiyua scored four consecutive points. In total, they each scored eight points, Southeast was still behind by ten points, making it 19 to 29.</p>
<h3>Section Four: No Change Still</h3>
<p>In the final section, Southeast had the momentum of burning their boats and making a last stand. Unfortunately, their formation became increasingly chaotic, their strength falling short of their desires, and they could only sigh in helplessness. After Ren Shu scored first, Chen Rongming of Liangjiang scored two consecutive shots and Pan Meng added two points. Southeast increasingly felt unsustainable. The outcome of the match was determined early. Southeast persevered and Liao Zhiyua made one free throw. The final result was 35 to 22, with Jiangnan winning and retaining the championship. The referees were Lu Xiangqian and Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<h3>Fudan Basketball Yesterday Also Defeated Qingguang, Result 58 to 27</h3>
<p>The Fudan University basketball team has been practicing diligently since the start of the semester in preparation for winning the Jiangda Basketball Championship. They have arranged matches with various strong teams in Shanghai for observation and learning. They defeated Youyou in one match and Artillery in another. Yesterday, they arranged a friendly match with the well-known Qingguang team of Shanghai at 7 PM in the university's gymnasium. Fudan's team has many talented players, and their basketball skills are improving rapidly. Qingguang's team has veteran players such as Tan Dahua and Dan Chunwu, who were once very formidable. Therefore, the performance of both sides was excellent yesterday. However, Fudan's team was younger and stronger, both offensively and defensively, and was superior to Qingguang. Therefore, they ultimately won by a large margin of 58 to 27. The details of the match are briefly recorded below.</p>
<p>The match began with the Fudan team rushing to the basket twice, both shots being successful. After some entanglement, Zhao Butian of Fudan fouled, and Dong Xiaopei of Qingguang scored one point from the free throw. Soon, Fudan launched several fierce attacks, and Zhao Butian and Zhou Dayun each scored a basket, making it 4 to 1. Qingguang scored one point from a free throw by Chen Hualu, and Tan Dahua scored a basket, and then Zhao Butian and Zhang Jinxiang of Fudan scored again, making it 8 to 3. Later, Qingguang tried hard to catch up, and Tan Dahua and Chen Hualu made contributions one after another, tying the score at 12 to 12. They even exceeded by two points. However, Fudan was still young and strong, and the two generals Zhou and Zhao dribbled the ball and charged forward, invincible. As a result, they ended the first half with a score of 26 to 20.</p>
<p>The second half started with the Fudan team adjusting their lineup, and the forwards were even more active. Within three minutes, the five tigers of Fudan had successively scored twelve points, while Qingguang still had nothing to show for it. After a long and hard fight, Dong Xiaopei finally scored a basket. Later, Fudan's momentum became stronger and stronger, and they scored point after point. The Qingguang team could not attack or defend. Like trapped beasts, they were unable to do what they desired. In conclusion, they were defeated by Fudan by a large margin of 58 to 27. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan Team Points ▲ Qingguang Team Points</p>
<p>Forward Zhao Butian 8 Forward Dong Xiaopei 8</p>

<h3>Datong University Promotes National Arts and All-Round Sports</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhijiang came to Shanghai this time to promote national arts. Yesterday, he accompanied the Central National Arts Touring Troupe to Datong University. First, Mr. Zhang gave a speech, advocating the purpose of national arts, which has two main points: 1. To strengthen the race; 2. To self-defend. He also said that scientific warfare is characterized by material means, while national arts training is characterized by spiritual strength. As exemplified by the anti-Japanese heroism of Nan Cai and Bei Song recently, they both benefited from the help and salvation of national defense. Material strength alone is not enough to overwhelm spiritual strength, but spiritual strength can restrain material strength. Subsequently, male and female troupe members performed various boxing styles, weapons, wrestling, and so on, as well as Mr. Li Xueqin's bicycle performance and Mr. Zhang's Eight Immortals sword performance. More than a thousand spectators were deeply impressed. It is also reported that the school will hold an all-round sports meeting on the 25th of this month.

<h3>Special Article China Overview of Modern Educational Thought (6) Shu Xincheng's Lectures, Sun Qingcai's Notes (4) Period of Political Revolution丨(Republic of China Years 12 and 13丨Republic of China Year 17)</h3>
<p>New education has been vigorously promoted for many years, but in reality, it has not been of much benefit to the country and society. Therefore, everyone wants to find a way out in politics. During the 13th and 14th years of the Republic of China, there were many factions in the country, fighting each other. The general students in the schools were also competing to join factions, rushing and snatching, and promoting themselves. Social thought has changed greatly as a result, and the atmosphere is filled with political revolution everywhere. Now I will divide it into three aspects to explain.</p>
<p>Nationalist Educational Thought Nationalist educational thought originated from the political ideology of nationalism. Political nationalism began in Sparta, was revived in the eighteenth century, and flourished in the nineteenth century. In modern times, the advocates of political nationalism included Germany, Turkey, and Italy. Although the various theories advocated by this doctrine are very complex, they also have a common background. This background is the oppression of foreign powers. The ideology of nationalism in Chinese politics was not widely advocated until after the eleventh year of the Republic of China. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, as nationalism became widely advocated, nationalist educational thought also followed suit. It was nothing more than taking internal and external troubles as its background and self-reliance and self-strengthening as its purpose. At that time, the people who advocated the revival of nationalistic education had some deep research and their theories were relatively complete. Although educational ideology and political advocacy were mixed together, subject to the control of actual political forces, and could not be fully developed, in a negative aspect, there were two very obvious facts that were enough to show its influence on actual education. These two facts are the recovery of educational rights and military training. However, in addition to the above two influences, why could nationalist educational thought not have a greater impact? This is probably due to the following reasons: First, the Chinese people are historically rich in the idea of Great Harmony; second, the reflection of church education; third, the failure of utilitarian education; fourth, the mixing of educational ideology and political advocacy.</p>
<p>Civic Educational Thought The reason for the emergence of civic educational thought was due to the chaos of Chinese politics and the mixing of world democracy. After the end of the European War, democracy was widely advocated in various countries, and the wave spread to China. At that time, the American educational philosopher Dewey came to China to give lectures after the end of the European War (ninth year of the Republic of China), and vigorously promoted democracy in education. Those who studied education in the United States also returned to China based on the situation in the United States and vigorously promoted civic educational thought. As a result, civic educational thought developed rapidly. At first, the moral education courses in primary and secondary schools were uniformly changed to civic courses. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, with the promotion of the Shanghai YMCA and the Jiangsu Educational Association, and the advocacy of the New Educational Review, it spread to the national education community and extended beyond schools. How is civic education to be interpreted? Scholars have different opinions. Li Huang said that civic education should be: (1) the development of historical education; (2) the explanation of joint responsibility; (3) the cultivation of national concepts. Cheng Xiangfan said, "European and American scholars have two main views on the meaning of civic education. One is narrow, taking the knowledge, habits, skills, appreciation, concepts, thoughts, and spirit that citizens must have in politics as the standard; the other is broad, in addition to creating political qualifications, it also involves society, family, humanity, occupation, and personal moral cultivation." The change of civic educational thought can be divided into four periods, extending to the end, and from school civic education to social civic education. In practice, there have also been extensive movements, which completely declined after the sixteenth year. The meaning of civic education, although not completely consistent due to the times and scholars' opinions, is generally aimed at cultivating the virtues of respecting the law, loving the country, and loving the people. However, public morality has not been improved as a result. There are three major reasons for this: first, because people's livelihoods are difficult and they do not hesitate to sacrifice; second, it is hindered by the traditional ideology of not emphasizing civic morality in Chinese history; third, it is the bad influence of politics. Therefore, although public avoidance education has been developed for decades, even if there are considerable achievements in schools, it will still ultimately be unable to withstand the molding of the environment in society and will not have much practical effect.</p>
<p>Party-Oriented Educational Thought Party-oriented education is a term of the Chinese Kuomintang after seizing political power in China in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. It was brewing until April of the sixteenth year, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. The Kuomintang carried out anti-communism in action and sought independence in theory. Therefore, the four characters of "party-oriented education" were clearly stipulated by the Education Administration Committee under the National Government. Wei Ke was one of the members. He proposed the term party-oriented education and defined its meaning as follows: "Party-oriented education is revolutionary and popular education, and it is also scientific and socialized education." Wang Kerenshi said, "The positive meaning of party-oriented education is that education must be revolutionary, personalized, popular, socialized, and scientific. If education is not like this, it cannot save the country. Education that cannot save the country is not the party-oriented education advocated by the Chinese Kuomintang." Lu Jizeng said, "Party-oriented education is education that teaches us how to be human..." At that time, the four characters of party-oriented education were discussed everywhere. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Wu Zhihui and other people, seeing that the meaning of the term party-oriented education was too broad, and that the Communist Party was also a party and the Kuomintang was also a party, could not avoid confusion. They wondered whether this so-called party-orientation was the Communist Party or the Kuomintang, so they advocated changing it to "Three Principles of the People Education." From then on, only the term Three Principles of the People Education was seen. Although party-oriented education was created because of the Kuomintang, there is no basis for it in the Kuomintang's classics. However, it has evolved into a trend of thought due to "secular usage." Because it is secular usage and not a systematic advocacy by enlightened people, the content is uncertain and the public is easily misunderstood. In the three or four years after the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, due to the drive of political forces, the chaotic ideology of party-oriented education has had many bad consequences. This phenomenon is deeply felt by those who advocate party-oriented education.</p>

<h3>On Destiny</h3>
<p>— A word of caution</p>
<p>"When luck departs, gold loses its luster; when fortune arrives, stubborn iron emits light."</p>
<p>The above two ancient sayings, although purely of a sentimental nature, are quite apt and reasonable, and can be said to be sentiments expressed at just the right time! Because we live in this world, as long as we have eaten rice for two or three decades, after studying the various facts they have seen, they will develop the following feeling: people with talent and virtue will not necessarily have any development, and people without talent and virtue will not necessarily starve to death; and the two are often arranged in reverse order, and the higher the talent, the newer the thought, and the more honest the integrity, the more they are often suppressed in the lowest level, even to the point of death, on the contrary, the more useless and unorthodox figures are, the more they are able to place themselves above the clouds and enjoy endlessly. What is the reason for this? No one can explain it, and the most appropriate thing is naturally to attribute it to the problem of destiny!</p>
<p>I remember hearing a small story a long time ago, which was an episode from the Qianlong Emperor's tour of Jiangnan. "Maybe it was Emperor Kangxi, but no matter, it was one of the two." He said: One day, the Qianlong Emperor went to visit a large temple outside Nanjing City. The monks knew that the current emperor had arrived, and they had to prostrate themselves to greet him from afar and treat him warmly. The Qianlong Emperor was very pleased, so he ordered his attendants to reward him with many things. Coincidentally, at that time, a poor scholar who had failed the imperial examination was staying at this temple. When he heard about the Qianlong Emperor's actions, he sighed and said: "No wonder the times are changing, even the emperor likes to flatter, but it's cheaper for these bald heads. They don't have to work hard to get such a large sum of money. I have studied hard for ten years, but I can't even hope for a small future!" Just at this time, the Qianlong Emperor passed by his house and heard every word of it. He immediately called him out, and when he looked at his window assignments, he found that he actually had some solid learning. However, since he had just heard him criticizing himself behind his back, he couldn't help but feel a little unhappy, so he said the following words. He said, "His luck is good, not yours." (He was referring to the monk) "Otherwise, why would he have benefits when he sees me, but you can't please me when you see me?"</p>
<p>At first, I felt that the emperor was very unreasonable. Since he saw that his literary talent was good, he should have promoted him. Why did he say such cold words that would kill people? But now that I think about it, the Qianlong Emperor's words are really good, both philosophical and very humorous, and really worthy of admiration. The two most insightful sentences, "His luck is good, not yours," are even more enough to awaken and enlighten the deaf, and wake up the illusions of today's common scholars who only know how to complain about the sky and blame the earth, but do not blame their own destiny. Therefore, I will re-enact it and write an essay on destiny.</p>
<h3>Sick Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived, and gardeners are busy carrying chrysanthemums to the market to exchange for money.  Poetic Chinese people all understand that holding a crab while admiring chrysanthemums is an elegant affair. Though they may be utterly lacking in refinement from head to toe, and in all their daily activities, at least for the brief moment of holding a crab and admiring chrysanthemums, they possess a touch of elegance. However, holding a crab without admiring chrysanthemums is not refined enough; but admiring chrysanthemums without holding a crab is still the mark of a refined person with deep sentiments.  In this, the chrysanthemum gains an advantage. Master Kong [Confucius] said, "Food and sex are human nature."  Both are mentioned together without bias, but food is a notch below sex; food is vulgar, sex is refined. Just feast your eyes and you won't starve, because beauty is food for the soul.</p>
<p>Following this tradition, more and more people now admire chrysanthemums, improving on past practices. They are no longer satisfied with a few plants by the fence or a cluster in a vase. They also pay attention to the seedlings. Thus, the standard for that word "elegant" has been raised.  One must know and be able to distinguish terms like "royal yellow," "willow thread," and "pear fragrance" to be considered elegant. An admirer of the colorful "radish threads" in a few mud pots must retreat to the realm of the vulgar.</p>
<p>There are also a few gardeners who pride themselves on their skills and want to show off their art. They cultivate chrysanthemums into bizarre shapes, almost making people suspect they are not chrysanthemums at all. Some pots have hundreds of flowers, tied with lead wire to look "neat and tidy." Some have two types of flowers blooming on a single stem. Some are made into brocade screens. Some are made into pagodas.  These are artificial and arbitrary. Displayed in the halls, they are naturally resplendent and magnificent, like the "Tang Gardens."  But these chrysanthemums, like the diseased plum blossoms seen by Gong Ding'an in the Jiangzhe region, must also be called diseased chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Here, I have come to realize a small truth: all beautiful art cannot be without flaws. Those aesthetic theorists who truly take naturalness as beauty are really just putting on a good face. I have yet to see anyone who advocates natural beauty go to the countryside and fall in love with a village girl, or in the city allow a woman to have unkempt hair and coarse clothing, without any makeup. So, perhaps it is precisely the flaw that is the beauty. Is this the true meaning of beauty?</p>
<h3>Evening View by the River</h3>
<p>— Jin Junjue</p>
<p>Sadly lying in Baimeen, unable to return,</p>
<p>Gazing daily at the verdant hills by the sandy shore.</p>
<p>The Six Dynasties have vanished with the fragrant grass,</p>
<p>Spring always brings separation from old friends.</p>
<p>The river's clamor disturbs lingering dreams at noon,</p>
<p>The sky presses the lonely city, leaving only setting sun rays.</p>
<p>I have failed to use my life to achieve great things,</p>
<p>I do not envy the fat fish among the reeds.</p>
<h3>On the Road to the Mausoleum</h3>
<p>— Jin Junjue</p>
<p>The mountain clouds gather, eager to turn into rain,</p>
<p>The fragrance of flowers mixes with the mud along the way.</p>
<p>The call of the partridge echoes incessantly from the forest,</p>
<p>The setting sun lingers over the walls of Xiaoling, west of the high city.</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nineteen:  Desiring to Leave Yet Not Leaving, Recalling Past Events in the Same Car; Half-Crying, Half-Laughing, Leaning on a Pillow, Sick in the Waning Autumn</p>
<p>Seeing that his intentions were somewhat moved, Huang Manying urged him on, and he no longer declined. After eating, he went to the city with Huang Manying on a long-distance bus. After entering Xizhimen, they took a trolleybus. There were quite a few villagers on this trolleybus, some carrying large packages and small baskets, looking quite like long-distance travelers. Huang Manying smiled at Guizhi and said, "This trolleybus is like a train, with many people going out." Guizhi had never taken a train anywhere, so she couldn't answer this question and just smiled without saying anything else. An old man sitting on the long bench opposite them interjected with a smile: "Isn't that so? We just treat the trolleybus as a train. Before, going from Jingxi to Jingnan meant going around half the city, which was strangely close. Now that we have trolleybuses, going from northwest to due south, passing through the city, is much faster. It seems I'm going to Dahongmen. After getting off the trolleybus and exiting Yongdingmen, it's not far. If you walked the whole way, it would be much farther." Guizhi suddenly heard the three characters "Dahongmen," as if such a place name had been left in her ears, but she couldn't remember for a moment what relationship this place name had to herself, but she paid attention to it. So she glanced at the old man and asked: "Dahongmen? Is that place very lively?" The old man said: "It's a village five or six li outside Yongdingmen. What's lively about it?" Huang Manying said: "I went to Nanyuan to watch horse racing and passed by there. There seemed to be two small teahouses with nothing else. How do you know that place?" Guizhi smiled: "I don't know either, it seems I just remembered such a place name in my ears." As she spoke, there were more people on the trolleybus, and the noise was especially loud, so after saying this, she stopped. When they arrived at the Huang's house, Manying's parents inevitably fussed around for a while. They knew that their daughter was feeling very uncomfortable, and it would be good to have Guizhi accompany her to chat and laugh, so after she arrived, they kept her for three days in a row.

<h3>Sketches in a Car</h3>
<p>— Chen Bijun</p>
<p>The sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness of life naturally shift with the environment. The happiest time is probably during one's school days. One day last week, I was traveling and took the Shanghai-Nanjing Line's No. 7 up train. The scenery along the way was already in a state of late autumn. There were not many passengers in the car, so it was very quiet. When the car arrived at a certain place, a group of female students from a tour group came up. Some were dressed in Boy Scout uniforms, others wore ankle-length blue cheongsam school uniforms. Each was lively, energetic, scrambling for seats, making a lot of noise. The atmosphere in the car suddenly became tense. The male teacher leading them was obsequious to these coquettish female compatriots, looking like a snobbish monk in a large temple fawning over wealthy pilgrims. After a while, the car started, and their chatter began. The focus of the conversation was nothing but teasing. They were eloquent, humorous, and quick-witted. They called their fellow villagers from Ningbo "Ningbo sisters." When they met comrades from Jiangbei, they addressed them as "Yangzhou sisters." When they saw a classmate sitting alone in a corner, silent, they said that she was thinking of her dream lover, or that her lover had broken their date and not arrived to see her off when the school departed this morning, and now she was angry. They would continue until the other person couldn't bear it and fought back, trying to shut them up. At that point, they would curl up and beg for mercy, contradicting themselves by saying: "Oops! I misspoke, my dream is over. She's probably unhappy now because she couldn't sleep last night. The reason she couldn't sleep was either because she was burning the midnight oil writing love letters, or because she was rummaging through boxes looking for lost love letters." As soon as they finished speaking, knowing that the other person was about to retaliate, they immediately ran into another group of classmates, hugging someone's waist and shouting, "Good sister, save me!" Everyone in the car roared with laughter. Among them were female students who loved music, so they began to play the harmonica. Some sang along with it. When it was loud, the sound was like tearing silk; when it was low, it was like a spring murmuring at the bottom of a ravine. The delicate, gentle waves of sound not only broke the silence in the car but even drowned out the rattling sound of the train. Some who liked to dance found some space and danced to the rhythm of the harmonica and singing: ballroom dance, solo dance, international dance, dancing non-stop. When they arrived in Suzhou, they became particularly excited. Everyone leaned out of the window, buying and buying large amounts of lard cake, zongzi candy, watermelon seeds, and sesame cakes, devouring them with gusto. An old woman selling fresh flowers carried a basket of gardenia flowers and was quickly sold out. They hung them on their clothes, and a strong fragrance immediately spread.</p>
<p>Before long, I reached my destination and parted ways with this group of happy angels. Alas! School days seem like being intoxicated in a paradise as sweet as honey. There are no clouds of sorrow or scenes of misery around, no disputes. None of the world's evils have been transmitted to them. They are really adorable. Alas, my childhood has passed, and my youthful beauty is no more. Seeing the scenery evokes endless emotions.</p>

<p>Where Travels Lead</p>
<h3>Sketches of a Return Voyage (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Huang Kangtun</p>
<p>The lush tropics remain unchanged, but my youthful acquaintance has aged. The sea breeze has not calmed, and the mountain rain is about to come, but I hide in a corner to hum my doggerel:</p>
<p>"The hot wind blows me back to my hometown, taking off my travel clothes and putting on my old ones; having tasted coconuts and durians everywhere, I will enjoy red persimmons, green tangerines, and fragrant crab roe."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Mountain Top</h3>
<p>A disheveled country girl, once she enters the city, applies makeup, and puts on fashionable clothes, actually turns into a modern young woman. A barren mountain, after more than eighty years of modern urban facilities, has actually become an important port in the East. Hong Kong! It is naturally the southern gate of great China! The seawater is green and more lovely than the eyes of Western beauties; the mountain tops are more alluring than the peaks of a virgin's breasts. But this peerless beauty of the East was long ago seduced by a burly Briton and became the fourth companion, after Malta, Colombo, and Singapore, to come east from the Mediterranean. The British Empire is truly blessed with good fortune! The old and dim-sighted Qing court not only gave away a "Wang Zhaojun."</p>
<p>Passing through Hong Kong, this is the fourth time. Ascending Hong Kong Mountain, it is the first time. Taking the cable car up. The seats of the cable car are tilted. When going down, you must face backwards; it is not as comfortable as the cable cars on Penang Hill, which are made with flat seats. The car stops at a height of one thousand three hundred and five feet. There is a seven-story mountain top hotel. In front are two mountain tops: one has the Governor's residence, barracks, and radio station, which must be reached by walking or sedan chair. The other has a hotel, post office, police station, and several Western-style residences, which can be reached by car. From the mountain top, overlooking the port city, Kowloon, and the islands at sea, it is as if a picture is spread out under the table. Looking south, it is vast and boundless, with islands scattered like stars, resembling the remaining pieces of a game of chess on the board. The roads on each mountain top are flat, wide, sturdy, and clean, and the architecture is magnificent and beautiful, no different from the urban construction on the plains. The ingenuity of the design and the boldness of the ambition cannot but be admired, but in reality, who are the ones working hard there, carrying stones and gathering peaks? Are they not all our compatriots? Who is picking stones there? Are they not the female generals of our Guangdong labor circles!</p>
<h3>On the Way to Guangzhou-Kowloon</h3>
<p>Those who grow up in the Yangtze River basin or the Yellow River basin, if they have never been to the East China Sea, will not know "the beauty of the sea." Similarly, they may not know "the beauty of the climate and geography of southern China." They will not deeply understand why the awakening of the modern Chinese nation started from the south and spread north. This is my inner motive for wanting to go to Guangzhou to see.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is one hundred and eleven miles long. One-fifth of it was built by the British and is managed by the Hong Kong government; four-fifths were reclaimed and self-managed by the people of Guangdong for national pride. From Kowloon to Shenzhen, the section built by the British is full of overlapping mountains and five tunnels. The longest is 7,250 feet. Along the way, the mountains surround the water, resembling a lake. Green rice fields and white-walled, black-tiled farmhouses are scattered in the mountain valleys and by the water's edge. The scenery is picturesque. North of Shenzhen, the plains gradually widen. The land is fertile and resembles the Shanghai-Hangzhou road. Low and flat rice paddies, dense and lush lychee orchards symbolize a peaceful rural atmosphere that has not yet declined.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Guangzhou</h3>
<p>The train arrived at Dashatou in the hazy night. The sound of a motorcycle took me to the East Asia Hotel. After dinner, I walked to the newly completed "Haizhu Bridge." There were no street lights along the way. The cars, horses, and pedestrians seemed to be groping in the dark. The bridge is a completely steel and concrete European-style building; it can be boasted as unique in southern China. The next day, I hired a rickshaw and, in one day, traveled to the First Park, Huanghuagang, Zhixin School, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Guanyin Mountain, and Sun Yat-sen University. The magnificent architecture of the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs, the lushness of the tomb forest, and the array of memorial arches seem to evoke a deeper sense of antiquity and a moving sense of sadness compared to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in the capital. The Memorial Hall is in front of Guanyin Mountain and is an octagonal palace style, with blue-glazed tiles and a white porcelain dome, symbolizing the party emblem. The Memorial Tower on the top of the mountain overlooks the entire city of Guangzhou. Slightly below is Hu Hanmin's seal script "Mr. Sun's Study and Administration Office," etc. The old buildings were all destroyed by Chen Jiongming's rebellion during the artillery fire in the tenth year of the Republic of China. The new atmosphere of the founding of the revolutionary base can be revealed in these new constructions.</p>

<h3>Securities: Sluggish Environment, Public Bonds Mostly Up, Few Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, there were no new developments regarding the situation in Fujian. The central government is actively preparing to deal with the situation severely, and it is unlikely to suddenly escalate. This is the second brewing period after the Fujian incident, approaching the delivery date of forward contracts on the distant-value exchange. The speculative nature has been somewhat reduced. The long and short sides have reached a point of close combat, so the supply and demand of chips can temporarily be unaffected by this sluggish environment. The reporter predicts that it will not be smooth sailing, mainly because there are still many floating longs and shorts on both sides, so there will inevitably be twists and turns. Based on the current environment, price fluctuations may depend on the supply and demand of chips, with the exception of changes in the Fujian situation. At the opening yesterday morning, various factions still covered their shorts, with purchases of issues 47 and 38, while issue 21 continued to be sold. Market prices continued to rise sharply, mostly by 30-40 cents to 70-80 cents. In the second session, the longs also swapped positions, and there were some rumors in the market, so prices uniformly retreated by 20-50 cents. In the afternoon, another session was held, and there were still some rumors in the market. The aforementioned issues uniformly retreated by 30-50 cents. After entering, issue 4 still saw purchases, and Salt Tax bonds did well, rising by 10-20 cents. As a result, market prices saw mixed gains and losses, with more gains than losses. Among them, only Gold Short fell by 69 cents, Consolidated 6 rose by 47 cents, and the rest fluctuated by 30-40 cents. The total trading volume was 25,194,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot goods, and 8,850,000 yuan in Salt Tax futures, 4,075,000 yuan in Disbandment bonds, 2,770,000 yuan in 1920 Customs bonds, 5,045,000 yuan in 20-roll 20-Customs bonds, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reported on the New York stock market on the 22nd. The situation was stable, with slight fluctuations in various stocks. President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a speech on Friday night, so speculators are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is stagnant. US Treasury bonds were affected by Professor Schlichter's book, falling by nearly one dollar, but after the official gold price remained unchanged and the US dollar stabilized, it rebounded by half a dollar. French bonds rose slightly, while Belgian bonds fell slightly. The total trading volume for the day was 1.57 million shares. According to a report in Iron Age, steel production is at 27.5%. It is believed that production has reached rock bottom, and there may be a surge at the beginning of 1934. Current orders have only increased slightly compared to before, but there will be demand from the automotive industry, public works, and railway projects. Regarding railways, it is rumored that major railways will rely on the government to purchase materials. The "wheat" market is psychologically unstable and slightly weak, with a temporary trend towards selling wheat. "Cotton" lacks favorable factors for the long side. Even considering the possibility of inflation, without any definite action, the market cannot be raised in advance. The long side should consolidate positions. The gold disposal committee's buying price for gold remained unchanged at $33.76.</p>

<p>40 Bonds 78.62 Down 0.74</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn: Fluctuations Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but in reality, it remained flat. Current yarn sales are stagnant, and all parties are affected by the economy, with a significant lack of purchasing power. In addition, the unrest in Fujian has further reduced demand from the southern ports, so the overall trend remains weak. In the afternoon, there was talk in the market of factories stopping night work and a certain association buying yarn. Prices rose by one yuan in recent months, but after the close, the reporter's factual investigation revealed that two brokers had purchased slightly in December. There is absolutely no such thing as stopping night work.</p>
<h3>Cotton Futures: Market Turns Bullish</h3>
<p>The cotton futures market opened in the morning, falling one to two cents for each month due to the decline in US cotton and persistent rumors about the situation. In the afternoon, rumors of factory closures were rampant in the market, and market sentiment was agitated. Near-month contracts rose by 90 cents to 1.4 yuan, and far-month contracts rose by 20-30 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 14,200 bales. Sales included 1,450 bales of Sui Long, 550 bales of Chun Ji, 1,200 bales of Yuan Da, 400 bales of Da Feng, and 400 bales of Yuan Tai. Purchases included 1,150 bales of Chang Feng, 600 bales of Shen Ji, 600 bales of Tong He, 650 bales of Jin Chang, and 400 bales of Tong Xing. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Closing Prices: Rise/Fall Outstanding Balance Cotton Futures Closing Prices: Rise/Fall Outstanding Balance</p>
<p>November 18.68 Up 0.10 47,000 February 18.50 Up 0.06 43,450</p>

<p>January 18.49 Up 0.07 59,650 April 18.52 Up 0.03 10,600</p>
<p>Total 232,200</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales: Slightly Over 500 Bales</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales remain sluggish. According to statistics, various firms bought a total of 522 bales throughout the day. Prices are flat. The purchase amounts for each firm are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 202 Nanjing 5 Sichuan 125 Zhenjiang 45 Northern Firms 10</p>
<p>Jiangxi 40 Shantou 20 Fellow Traders 15 Luzhou 60</p>
<p>The cotton market continues to show a weak trend. With declines in the US and Indian cotton markets and stable gold prices, market sentiment is weak. Spot cotton prices in the market are decreasing, but cotton futures alone are rising. Generally, cotton merchants are in a long position, absorbing the volume and not releasing it, so the market is in a state of hesitation. Judging from the state of the world cotton industry, the future is difficult to be optimistic about. The current exchange price for US cotton has broken the $40 mark.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton: Weak</h3>
<p>The Zheng Cotton market opened weak in the morning, falling by 10 to 15 cents due to weak foreign cotton. In the afternoon, it opened following the rise in the yarn market, but closed lower again, with each month rising by 5 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 62,300 dan. Sales included 1,300 dan of Da Fu, 2,500 dan of Tong Ji, 1,500 dan of Chun Ji, 3,200 dan of Geng Feng, 1,100 dan of Da Feng, 1,300 dan of Shen Chang, 3,700 dan of Yuan Da, 2,400 dan of Yu Chang, 3,600 dan of Yuan Xing Chang, and 2,000 dan of Chang He. Purchases included 1,000 dan of Rong Xing, 2,500 dan of Yuan Da, 1,800 dan of Yi Cheng, 4,300 dan of Da Chang, 3,800 dan of Xin Cheng, and 1,000 dan of Chang He. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>Limited Mill Demand</h3>
<p>Current cotton business is exceptionally quiet, and mill demand is quite sluggish. Sources include 1,454 bales of Yao cotton and 3,000 bales of Tong cotton. Current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton $44.65 Shanghai Factory Imports 200 pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Decline Uniformly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market initially rose due to good news from Liverpool, but later fell due to Southern selling. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 8 to 10 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 4 points, and futures all fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 1 point. The Bombay cotton market fell due to long liquidations. As a result, Pingar fell by 2 rupees, Omra fell by 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 1.75 rupees.

<h3>Grain Market: Flour Futures Recover After Initial Decline, Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening, showed signs of an initial decline followed by stabilization for each month's contracts. With foreign wheat prices reported at 45 cents lower for Chicago and 23 cents lower for Canadian, market sentiment remained weak at the opening. Near and distant futures continued to decline by around 2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The enthusiasm of actual sales customers also ceased. Tianjin spot prices, after the arrival of Shanghai flour, were normal in sales volume, so quoted prices also continued to decline, falling by 8 cents compared to the previous day, currently selling at $2.48. However, non-industry sentiment was exceptionally strong, with purchases made in each session, and the market was held up. By the afternoon opening, firms from Tianjin and Shandong continued to sell, but speculative firms and some manufacturers in the market continuously covered shorts and bought longs, leading to stabilization and bullishness for both near and distant contracts. Observing the subsequent steps, it seems that a temporary consolidation is needed. As a result, the current month improved by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, December improved by 1.25 cents, January improved by 1.7 li, February and March improved by 7.5 li, and April improved by 1 cent.</p>
<h3>Wheat: Weakness Followed by Recovery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a pattern of initial decline followed by a rise. With foreign wheat prices reported at 45 cents lower for Chicago and 23 cents lower for Canadian, at the opening, the current month was not open, and distant futures were down by 3-4 cents. However, by the second session, due to the weakness and subsequent recovery of the flour market, market sentiment improved and prices rebounded. By the afternoon opening, with large long position holders still absorbing and the selling of current foreign wheat difficult to materialize for the time being, quoted prices for each month recovered. Judging by the current situation, it seems there is no sign of a decline. As a result, the current month improved by 2 cents, December improved by 4 cents, January improved by 5 cents, February improved by 2 cents, and March improved by 3 cents. The current wheat market remains stable and bullish, with Five Rivers wheat opening at $4.20, Zhenjiang wheat at $4.00, and Pudong wheat at $3.94-$3.90. Xinda sold 1,000 bags, and Fufeng sold 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Bagged Rice: Sales Decline, Evening Weakness Causes a Fall of a Few Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources still total forty to fifty, (over six thousand piculs), though there were continued sales of four thousand-odd bags of late rice by various firms, (over five thousand piculs), their intentions seemed to have declined. Due to the impact of the Fujian incident, buyers have retreated, and the market shape has suffered a setback, reversing the prosperity of recent days and presenting a fatigued state. Therefore, although the supply of late rice is not strong, prices have fallen by a few cents. Only the special grade of Qingjiao rice has been able to hold steady. Street sales have also declined compared to the past, estimated at over a thousand piculs, causing the market to soften. Prices for Chang rice, Su rice, and Nangang rice have all fallen by several cents to a few cents. Only the scarce Duyang sharp rice remains firm. The Yinyuan distillery firms have strong demand, and the situation remains tight, so prices have continued to rise.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Sources total around fifty firms. There was some trading in various routes in the market. Prices for new japonica early thin rice are slightly fatigued. The Yangdubu and Ke Xian rice are flat. The Baiyuan distillery has been actively stocking, with prices slightly fatigued by a few cents.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice: Spring and Yong had shipments yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market turned flat. The Fuzhou firms have not inquired since the Fujian Incident. Fuzhou has a large sales volume, and the market and market sentiment have been affected by their suspension. However, after prices fell slightly, local and Ningbo firms made inquiries. Yesterday, Ningbo continued to load shipments, and Quanzhou firms, after suspending for two days, returned to the market yesterday to purchase 376 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, priced at $7.70 to $7.50. Ningbo continued to load 100 bags of Hunan Guangjing rice, priced at $5.70, and 120 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled early rice, priced at $6.10 to $6.05, and 160 bags of rough early rice, priced at $5.30. Local firms have not inquired about Ke Xian rice. Yesterday, 150 bags of Wuxi machine-milled rice were purchased, priced at $8.45. The market is similar to the previous session, and the market seems to have stabilized.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Flour and White Rice Shipped to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Since this week, the flour and white rice market in North China has suddenly become active, with Tianjin firms stationed in Shanghai purchasing and shipping goods. In the past two days, over 100,000 bags of flour have been shipped to Tianjin. Today, two British merchant ships exported over 180,000 bags of flour and over 10,000 bags of white rice. It is said that there are still 200,000 bags of flour waiting to be shipped, which must be shipped out before the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Temporarily Neither Prosperous nor Humiliated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean trade was still connected, with a total of six or seven carloads of goods and fifteen to sixteen hundred bags of ship goods being traded. Market prices were temporarily neither prosperous nor humiliated. Compared to other miscellaneous grains, the soybean market has been slightly advantageous recently. The reason being, Dalian beans have stopped arriving, and Niuzhuang and Tianjin beans are only a small supplement. Therefore, general trading can still continue, but the momentum is not as good as in previous years.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Wufu Brand Ice Sugar Slightly Loosens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained flat. The association's set price for 24 coarse sand white common goods was $20.20, with one to two hundred bags traded at the original price. Dutch red and Taikoo sugar saw no fluctuations. Chunghwa, Guohua, and Zhenji Brand No. 1 local factory cotton white sugar still opened at $18.95. New Chao Qing opened with 34 bags, priced at $15.50. Chen Chao Qing opened with over 60 bags, priced at $15.40 to $14.55. The standard Wufu white ice sugar opened a total of a hundred boxes before and after, priced at $18.30 per stone, slightly lower than the previous session by 10 cents.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Opening Price Increases</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli used to have extremely low opening prices due to oversupply, reaching as low as $17.30. Now, due to the cold weather in the origin, work has stopped producing, and purchase prices have also rebounded. In addition, winter sales here are about to begin, and the market situation has become tight. Opening prices for customer goods have rebounded to $18, and the market price (92 skin) has increased by 50 cents, calling for $17.50. The North standard is calling for over $18, and the market may continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Sales Slump</h3>
<p>Yokohama Raw Silk Plummets Continuously: Recently, the Yokohama raw silk market has suffered a sharp drop in silk prices due to the slump in European sales. Yesterday, the B-grade opened at only 540 yen, and converted to Chinese currency, it has fallen below 500 yuan, setting a new record low not seen in decades.</p>
<p>Silk Factories' Silk Production Increasingly Scarce: European sales of white filature silk have plummeted. Inland silk factories are unable to support themselves, and most have stopped work, so the production volume of filature silk is decreasing daily, and sources are increasingly scarce. Yesterday, only 26 pieces of silk from the Wuxi Zhenyi Factory arrived.</p>
<p>Rayon Sales Increasingly Sluggish: With fluctuating exchange rates, rayon sales are sluggish. Yesterday, only Han firms purchased twelve boxes of Jin Yu, Shuang Long, Pagoda, and other brands of current and futures, priced at $168.75 to $156.75 net.</p>
<p>Western Silk Difficult to See Turnaround: The surface of the local Western silk market shows no sign of life. New York's current silk inventory is thick, and prices are declining. The ang silk remains unchanged, and no one inquires about current silk. Shanghai's GM and other firms have not issued any silk telegrams regarding the overseas situation. Market sentiment is silent. Yesterday, only an Indian firm imported six packages of Sichuan yellow silk and five packages of coarse yellow silk, and prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Fine Eyebrow and Pearl Tea Sell Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local Western and Native tea markets, Fine Eyebrow and Pearl Tea from both routes had incoming orders from the French and Moroccan markets. Across the entire city, firms such as Ju Tongxue and Yongchang and other firms purchased 280 boxes of Fine Eyebrow needles, pearls, and other items. The selling price for Fine Eyebrow was from $68 to $78, Pearl Tea was from $50 to $71, and Needle Eyebrow was $33. Market prices were generally fluctuating.</p>
<h3>Metals: Galvanized Iron Sells Well</h3>
<p>Galvanized iron has seen increased activity recently, with both customer and local firms making purchases, so honest firms that do not deal in inferior goods have been greatly impacted. For several days, warehouses such as those of Huishan, Mitsubishi, Osaka, and South Manchurian Railway have had large quantities of galvanized iron arrive, priced at $1.18 per piece for 7-foot and 98 cents for 6-foot. As a result, American goods have been most affected. English goods are priced at $1.38 per sheet for 7-foot and $1.16 for 6-foot, but there is no benefit to those in the same industry. Shunyu and fellow traders must not forget regulations for the sake of small profits.</p>
<h3>Huisi Iron: Over Five Hundred Tons Ordered Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an external telegram stated that 200 pounds of Huisi iron would sell for 3.6 gold yuan (equivalent to $7.20 per box), slightly lower than before. Therefore, fellow traders have made transactions, and it is heard that over five hundred tons have been ordered, which will be shipped in February of next spring. The firms responsible are those along North Suzhou Road and the French Concession.</p>

<h3>Hard to Be Confused</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Because someone mentioned writing seal script, I remembered that Zheng Banqiao had a seal engraved with "Hard to Be Confused." The four seal script characters were written in a clumsy style, which was quite capable of expressing a bit of the scholar's complaints. This shows that engraving seals and writing seal script also reflect a certain style, just like "playing" woodcuts, which may not "just be a personal matter": even if "monstrous" and "evil" people write seal script, they will also carry some "monstrousness."</p>
<p>However, styles and emotions, tendencies, etc., not only vary from person to person, but also vary from thing to thing, and from time to time. Zheng Banqiao said "Hard to Be Confused," but in fact, he was still able to be confused. Now, in the era of "It is not sad to fail to seek officialdom, but is it not the greatest sorrow in the world to seek seclusion and not find a place to flee to," it is really impossible to seek confusion.</p>
<p>The doctrine of confusion, the absence of a sense of right and wrong, etc., was originally a noble Chinese virtue. You say it is detachment, optimism. Not necessarily. In fact, he is stubbornly insisting on something, such as moral orthodoxy, literary purism, etc. This has finally been said: morality requires Confucius and Mencius plus the "Buddhist theory of retribution" (Lao-Zhuang is registered separately), and saying that others "despise" Buddhist influence is "wanting to fight for the orthodoxy of Confucianism." It turns out that the Three Teachings Originating from the Same Source theory of the Tongshan Society has long been orthodox. What about literature? It requires abstruse words, rhetoric, ornate works, and new literary works, even though he "denies the distinction between new and old literature"; and popular literature "is certainly supported," but "that is a side branch of literature." Orthodoxy and purism are obvious.</p>
<p>There is no confusion about weariness with life! Active life is already so "impoverished" that young people are asked to seek cultivation in "the Buddhist theory of retribution" and in "Anthology of Literature, Zhuangzi, Analects, Mencius." Later, cultivation disappeared, leaving only vocabulary. "Natural scenery, personal emotions, palace buildings, ...etc., may as well be found and used from books such as the 'Anthology of Literature'." In the past, Yan Jidao found the two words "moni" from some ancient book, probably Zhuangzi, to translate Unit, which was both elegant and had a dual meaning of sound and meaning. But later, what became popular was "unit." Mr. Yan had many such "vocabularies," but they were generally unable to be revived. Now, however, some people believe that "words after the Han Dynasty, words before the Qin Dynasty, and words brought by Western culture can be combined to create our shining new literature." If this brilliance is only in words, it is probably like a noble lady in an ancient tomb, covered in jewels. Life is not about piecing together, but about creation, and millions of living people are creating. The hateful thing is that life is so noisy and chaotic that some people "cannot find a place to flee to," wanting to escape into words in order to "avoid right and wrong," but it is impossible. It is really necessary to write seal script and engrave seals!</p>
<h3>A Half-Day Trip to West Lake</h3>
<p>— Wuxi</p>
<p>It was a Sunday, and it was drizzling, and there was nothing to do, and everyone felt bored. So, someone suggested going to Hangzhou to play for a few hours. Of course, no one objected, and I, wanting to go and see old books by the way, joined in. At 9:50, the car departed from K Station and moved forward in the sound of wind and rain. At this time, the countryside was very fresh, and the peaks on both sides were shrouded in thick white clouds. The vast sea, seen through the sparse trees on the seawall, was like a huge white cloud, slowly flowing in the sky. After about three quarters of an hour, we arrived at Haining. We really wanted to see the early tide of the day, but it had already receded. We ran to the Tide-Watching Pavilion, but all we could see was the vast ocean, slightly rippling, and we were of course very disappointed. Getting back on the car, we continued forward. The scenery along the way to Hangzhou was quite secluded and beautiful. In particular, the red maples and trees that constantly dotted the green forests, and the bamboo forests that stretched for several miles, gave us the feeling of being "in a painting," and we felt that this trip was truly a pleasant one.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, the car arrived in Hangzhou City, and the rain stopped. We crossed the inevitable muddy street and drove straight to Lou Wai Lou. There, we leaned on the railing and looked at the lake and mountains in the rain, and encountered many artistic students. We ate lunch, which was naturally Hangzhou-style food, but we had neither mandarin fish nor water shield. After lunch, friends from Hangzhou hired three lake boats for us to pass the time. I hadn't seen West Lake for several years. But this time, it didn't give me any sense of familiarity. The sky was filled with black clouds after the rain, and what I felt in my heart was nothing but endless oppression. This mountain, this water, this pavilion, this bridge, could not evoke my poetic thoughts, let alone my longing for the countryside. After careful appreciation, everywhere I felt was painted with a layer of gray melancholy, full of contradictions and unease. Especially the dirty, even smelly lake water, seemed to give me a huge revelation: West Lake is also in the process of decline. I did not feel happy on the lake.</p>
<p>One of our guides first led us to see "Liu Manor." According to him, people who visit "Liu Manor" cannot visit the whole thing; part of it is blocked off, but he, because of some relationship, has this privilege. So, we were led to this special forbidden area, which was a room displaying antiques. We didn't understand antiques, and he pointed them out to us one by one. This is a large war drum from the Song Dynasty. At that time, the army was defeated, and Liu Gong put it in the rapids to be washed away by the water. The enemy thought it was a war drum and didn't dare to chase. Later, it was moved back as a souvenir. This is something from the Song Dynasty, what the Japanese said, this is something from the Ming Dynasty, how much money the Westerners once offered to buy it. He spoke like a family treasure, but I was only concerned about the ancient books in the market, and my companions were all unrelated to antiques. It was really a waste of his much effort. After dawdling for over an hour, we followed his instructions and went to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon for a round on the stone slabs, and then the heavy rain poured down. Returning by boat in the wind and rain, our clothes and shoes were all wet, but I gained another kind of pleasure. The air was not as stuffy as before, and looking around, the wind and rain were dark, as if there would be a big change in the sky. The layered peaks and ridges on the lake were all covered with clouds galloping above, and the dark gray sky and faint chimes made us feel happy and refreshed.</p>
<p>Jumping off the tour boat, it was already half past three. I was afraid that the sky would soon darken, and there was no hope of seeing old books. Fortunately, there were many opportunities to come to Hangzhou, and old books were not necessarily a must-see. So, everyone casually bought some useful things by the lake, and then passed through "Qingtai Gate" to rush back on the two-hundred-mile journey.</p>
<h3>Jilin Street Scene</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>One morning in May, I walked east alone along Liangmihang Street, inhaling the air of Jilin's long street that I hadn't breathed in four or five years. I pretended to be a leisurely gentleman (of course, a gentleman wouldn't stroll early in the morning), wanting to see the scenery of the street in the morning.</p>
<p>The street was deserted. The doors of residences and small shops were tightly closed. Occasionally, there were a few horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws with empty seats. Judging by their relaxed appearance, one could guess that they had just left the carriage factory, and their eyes seemed not fully open yet. But for the sake of livelihood, they had to sacrifice some sleep. Most of the few people appearing on the street were carrying baskets to the market to buy vegetables. It was hard to find a second person walking on the street like me.</p>
<p>When I walked to the gate of the Women's Normal School and saw the five-colored flag hanging at the entrance, I realized it was Sunday. I had been living in a daze for the past few days and had forgotten the date. Just at this moment, the bells of the Catholic Church on Jiangyan Street rang closely, calling the believers of God to worship. It was only half past five. Although the warm sun had already slipped onto the street, it was not yet time for the female students to get up, so the entrance was quiet and no one went in or out. Only the two flags couldn't help but be beaten by the morning wind, making a low, bitter cry. On the contrary, across the road, at the entrance of a small opium shop with the sign "Yihexiang" hanging, some hunchbacked, sallow people were shuttling in and out. Not only men, but also some women, looking very busy.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of my stroll was the Chaoyang Street vegetable market, which could be said to be a lively place in Jilin in the morning. I wanted to see something from the bustle. Walking forward not far out of Xinkaimen, turning north for a while, I arrived. Five years ago, I had to come to the market every day, using a little money! To buy some vegetables home. Although it was once a day, I didn't feel bored because it was mechanical, because I found a kind of satisfaction in the vegetable market that I was very satisfied with, 丨丨 a kind of fun that I found interesting every day. That is, in the noisy market, with the curiosity of a middle school student, I could see every day how people were dressing up with fake faces, perfunctorily, sociably, and trading. I also used a middle school student's bit of wisdom to see as many cross-sections of society as possible. Also, there were other things that I found interesting, such as how a policeman used what methods to hunt down a criminal or a scoundrel that he thought was; one string of cash, two strings of cash, (this is Jilin's official note, at that time two strings were about one cent of silver dollar), what kind of disputes there were between vegetable sellers and customers, and even because of this, the transaction contract was broken, how much a beggar's outstretched dirty hand trembled, in short, all of these made me nostalgic for the vegetable market and made me not feel bored.</p>
<p>Thinking this way, I had already walked out of Xinkaimen and turned north. There were more cars, horses, and people, and I quickened my pace "Yijing Road."</p>
<p>A blue enamel sign nailed to the brick wall of a western-style house facing the street was lying in front of me, with these three white characters molded on it. I was stunned, thinking I had gone the wrong way, but after careful observation, my eyes told me that the road I was taking was not wrong at all. Only then did I know that Chaoyang Street had changed its name, and Yijing Road was its substitute. In the past, the signs marking street names in Jilin were all made of wood. Now they were replaced with blue enamel ones. Presumably, this was a kind of innovation under the rule of the so-called "Manchukuo" provincial capital of Jilin. Especially from the changed "Jing" road name, it can also be inferred that there are "Wei" roads, which may be a major road to develop a big Jilin city.</p>
<p>I arrived at the vegetable market. People were moving in groups, vegetable stalls were arranged in rows, selling small toys, selling matches, selling zongzi… All the scenes from five years ago were still what I saw now, not reduced at all, and I was once again like a citizen of Jilin from five years ago.</p>
<p>However, in terms of quantity, the reduction in vegetables is an undeniable fact. This situation, I heard, has continued for more than half a month, and the resulting expensive vegetable prices are cried out by everyone in unison. They don't know why there are fewer vegetables and the prices are going up. How would they think that Changchun is building palaces on a large scale, and tens of thousands of workers need vegetables to eat? Really, a lot of vegetables have been transported to Changchun.</p>
<p>After all, there are still differences from the scene five years ago. First, a large group of coolies stood at the "Kungfu Market" on the street corner, waiting for customers to hire them. The more people waited, the more there were. Never see less. Looking at their appearance, it was clear that their stomachs were empty. However, if you trace it back a few months, some of them were the rich households in the countryside. The political turmoil affected them. Japanese soldiers fought against the volunteer army, and bandits took advantage of the fire to rob, causing them to fall from a self-sufficient life into the abyss of famine all at once. They had no choice but to go to the city to seek a living, selling their labor. Second, from those selling matches to the goods sold in the shops, it can be said that they are all Japanese goods. Because they are cheap, who wouldn't want to buy them? "Man" and Japan joined hands to abolish tariffs, which caused Japanese goods to sell well. No matter how it is in itself, for the general public with reduced purchasing power, it has considerable benefits. In the crowd, I saw a police officer sitting in a rickshaw. After the car passed, I suddenly thought of recognizing him. That's right, my memory didn't deceive me after all. From the mouth of a policeman next to me, I found out that he was Director Cao. This reminded me of Cao Wendu in middle school. He has a Japanese wife, which is the main reason for his rise after the incident. I think he should be considered a hero made by the situation. I walked back the way I came. The small shops and residences had opened their doors. There were more people, and the deserted street became bustling.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (38)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>So he searched through his memory with all his reflection, all his intelligence, trying to reconstruct, to see again, to recognize, and to fully understand this man, this man who had passed before him during those years he lived in Paris, without causing him to pay attention. But he felt that his walking, the slight movement of his footsteps, somewhat disturbed his thoughts, preventing his thoughts from fixing, diminishing his ability to reflect, and obscuring his memory.</p>
<p>In order to make this sharp, unobstructed observation of the past and those events of unclear content, he had to be still in a vast, empty place. So he decided to sit on the quay as he had the night before.</p>
<p>As he approached the dock, he heard a desolate, miserable sigh coming from the sea, a sound similar to the roaring of a bull, but louder and more powerful. It was the sound of a steam whistle, the sound of a ship disappearing in the fog.</p>
<p>He felt as if this cry of impending danger that rang through his soul and his nerves had come from himself, and he trembled all over, his heart contracted. Then another similar sound was wailing in a slightly more distant place; afterwards, beside him, the dock's whistle responded to those whistles, sending out a sorrowful cry.</p>
<p>Bill strode onto the embankment, no longer thinking about anything, content to walk into this dismal, roaring darkness.</p>
<p>When he sat down at the end of the breakwater, he closed his eyes so as not to see the electric lights obscured by the fog, which made the docks appear friendly at night, and the almost imperceptible red light of the lighthouse on the south breakwater. Then, he turned halfway around, rested his elbows on the granite, and hid his face in his hands.</p>
<p>Although he did not say the word with his lips, his mind was repeating it, as if calling him, summoning and provoking his shadow: "Marais... Marais." And then, in the darkness of his lowered eyelids, he suddenly saw the him he had known before. It was a sixty-year-old man with a pointed white beard, thick eyebrows, also completely white. His height was neither tall nor short, his face was amiable, his eyes were gray, gentle, his movements humble, and from his appearance he was an honest, simple, and gentle person. He called Bill and Jeannot "my dear children" and never showed favoritism to one of them, inviting them both to his home for dinner.</p>
<p>So Bill, with the patience of a dog exploring a faint track, searched for the words, gestures, tones, looks, and so on of this man who had disappeared into the earth. Gradually, he completely discovered the Marais he had seen when he invited him and his brother to dinner at his apartment on Tronchet Street.</p>
<p>The two old maids who served him had long become accustomed to saying "Mr. Bill" and "Mr. Jeannot".</p>
<p>When the two young men went in, Marais casually extended his hands to them, his right hand to this one, his left hand to that one.</p>
<p>"Well, children. Have you received any letters from your parents lately? As for me, they never write to me."</p>

<h3>The Way of Cleverness</h3>
<p>— Cunren</p>
<p>On a clear and quiet night, I visited a worldly old man in his humble abode; the abode was a three-story building, facing the street, although the trams rattled and the cars roared, the noise of the city disturbed people but he did not feel it, as if he were a hermit, living peacefully, understanding the Tao. The old man said, "What do you come for?" I replied, "I dare to ask about the way of cleverness." The conversation had a theme, and thus became a question and answer.</p>
<p>"Difficult it is, the way of cleverness! Confucius's disciples such as Yan Hui, by using one corner to infer the other three, Confucius praised him as being exceptionally clever. In today's world, even those who can use one corner to infer the other three are not considered clever people. You ask about the way of cleverness, are you intentionally making it difficult for this old deaf man?"</p>
<p>"No, no, you old man has misunderstood my question! I do not want to be taught about the art of speculation. I am by nature clumsy and foolish, and have no way of dealing with the world, and often run into walls. I dare to ask about the way of cleverness in dealing with the world."</p>
<p>"Alas, you are indeed clumsy and foolish, and you ask about the way of dealing with the world! In today's world, the wise see wisdom, and the benevolent see benevolence. Classes are different, and thoughts are different. Fathers, sons, brothers, spouses, and sisters, because of the differences in thoughts, each family has its own opinions and prejudices. Even if they are close relatives, they are alienated, conflicted, and go their separate ways. The so-called heroes of ancient times each served their lords and became enemies. The so-called revolutionaries of today are mercilessly turned against each other for the sake of their class. Even if it is only because of the different positions, close relatives kill each other without mercy. Speculation and opportunism may win for a time, but will ultimately be unable to stand in the world. The way of cleverness has actually been exhausted, and only the foolish and clumsy can enjoy boundless happiness..."</p>
<p>"Although what the old man said is logical and reasonable, is there really no way of cleverness?"</p>
<p>"Then there is only the way of speculation and opportunism. Let me tell you about it: The way of speculation and opportunism lies in being slippery, and being slippery has become a specialized subject. Western European academic theories are divided into categories, including so-called scientific philosophers. The study of being slippery can also be called slippery studies. If slippery studies were to be written as a textbook by a university professor, it could be divided into several chapters, each chapter into several sections, and each section into several items, citing ancient and modern examples, combining Chinese and Western knowledge. The depth of its theory is even greater than philosophy, and the breadth of its citations includes all Chinese and foreign history, physics, chemistry, art, literature, business and trade, and the art of temptation and deception. Everything must be listed, encompassing everything. From university preparatory courses to the fourth year of university, this one textbook can only cover one-thousandth of it. Even if students pass all subjects upon university graduation, no matter how clever a student is, they will not be able to pass the slippery studies, and even the university professor himself may know that it is so, but not know why it is so. How difficult it is to learn can be imagined. I have lived in the world for decades, my head is bald, and my beard and hair are white. My experiences are not few, and my teachings are not few, but when I started to edit the textbook for slippery studies, I could only edit the first item of the first section of the first chapter. The outline of this first item of the first section of the first chapter is 'Sailing with the Current', that is, following the crowd, that is, liking what people like, and disliking what people dislike. To give an example, if what people dislike is a filial son, one of the remnants of the feudal patriarchal society's etiquette, then even if you have served your parents with soup and medicine, asked doctors and diviners, and done everything out of your nature to serve your parents, those who discuss the world's affairs should use the name of 'filial son' to blame you, only seeking the applause and cheers of the youth, regardless of your own inner thoughts and actions. If the criticized person is under the trend of the times and tries to defend himself, he will be further confirmed as a reactionary. From then on, the youth will beat the drums and attack him, leaving him with no intact skin. Your victory is not only already in your hands, but you are also revered as the supreme sage and great worthy by the youth. If a collection of short essays has this one article, it will be popular throughout the country and become a bestseller in Luoyang, and you will gain both fame and fortune, and your status will be boundless. As for the first item of the first section of the first chapter, which is 'Kicking a Man When He's Down', I also know a thing or two about it, but whenever I recall the person who kicks a man when he's down, I feel a headache and have no intention of editing it. However, although slippery studies are the way of cleverness, they are actually unorthodox methods, and you are not worth learning them."</p>
<p>"What the old man said is probably very reasonable. There are indeed many people in society today who use this knowledge as a stepping stone to make a living. They are indeed successful everywhere, gaining both fame and fortune, but I am a clumsy and foolish person, and I am afraid that I will not be able to learn it even if I try."</p>
<p>"Alas, you seek the way of cleverness, but you do not learn it. Although it is commendable, you are bound to run into walls!"</p>
<p>That night, I asked about the Tao from the worldly old man, and I returned as I was. Alas!</p>

<h3>Notes on How to Behave</h3>
<p>— Where to Go</p>
<p>People are always afraid of not knowing how to smile. If one can smile at all times and in all places, I dare say that no one will dislike him. Everyone knows that smiling expresses happiness, and because it expresses happiness, everyone likes it.</p>
<p>Conversely, crying is something that everyone hates; especially annoying is that kind of frowning face. Because when a person cries to me, he is simply complaining about his sorrow, and when he frowns, he is simply asking me to give him a hand. And both of these things make people equally bothered. Because the former simply wants to force my sympathy, while the latter forces me to open my pockets.</p>
<p>If it is a woman of a certain age and a certain appearance who cries to me and frowns at me, then there is still something to be said. Because this is, after all, not a kind of "no entry without exit" charitable donation. Everyone knows that something can still be gained in return. As for anything else, it is just a kind of spending money without any return. That is something that anyone who is even slightly clever will absolutely not do.</p>
<p>So, people are not afraid of being the best at smiling. The best at smiling is the best at pleasing people.</p>
<p>For example, you are a small official under a big official. One day, it just so happens that something goes wrong – so wrong that it provokes the great official's anger. So, he will call you in. At first, he will slam the table and scold you, "Damn it!", but in the end, because you screwed up so badly, he will become more and more angry. When he reaches a certain point of anger, he will jump up and slap you in the face a few times. At this time, if you cry or get angry, you will make things worse. Because philosophers have told us that when the boss is angry, you can neither cry nor get angry. If you cry or get angry, you will become the oil on his fire. As a result, you will only provoke his "old temper." At this time, you had better be "full of smiles" and "amiable," putting aside the fever on your face. If he hits you again, you just smile again. A person will always get tired of hitting. And he is hitting you simply to vent his anger. Anger has an end, and hitting people will also have a limit. Once the anger has been vented, naturally he will not hit you again. At that time, you just wait quietly for a period of time. When this period arrives, he will tell you to go out. Then you can leave with a smile. Let him think about it alone. In this, you know that a person always has a conscience. A big official is also a person, so you can always believe in it. When his conscience starts to work, he will think of your good points. "Ah, don't say it, this kid also has some good points," he will think like this. After thinking like this, he will think of the places where you have helped him in the past. At this time, he will say, "This kid, he has helped me before, and he still doesn't show any pride. The way I treat him is a little unfair to him." At this time, he will start to feel a little sad. As a result, he will definitely add a little star to your collar.</p>
<p>Oh, looking at it this way, isn't your good fortune coming from smiling? On the other hand, if you provoke his viciousness</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>, are you afraid that he won't throw you away?</p>
<p>So, to be a person, you must practice knowing how to smile. When you see people, you must smile. You must smile even when there is no one around. You must smile when you see a big boss, and you must smile even when you go to the latrine. In short, you must train smiling into an instinct. Conversely, you must not cry when your father dies, and you must not cry when your mother dies; you must not cry when your lover leaves, and you must not cry when the three northeastern provinces are lost. In short, you must also train not crying into an instinct. If you are full of smiles everywhere, everyone will like you when they see you. And your rice bowl will become as solid as iron.</p>

<p>This time, the Haijingbo Circus came to our Shanghai, and the whole of Shanghai (actually, besides Shanghai, there are also the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines, as well as the large and small cities and large and small villages near Shanghai) was sensationalized. The old masters, ladies, young masters, young ladies, and grandmothers who needed stimulation all formed teams and flowed out like crazy from the buses in front of the "Dahua" site, and then swarmed into a ticketing car with a "One Yuan Two Yuan Tickets Sold Out" sign hanging in the small window, vying to squeeze and stuff banknotes and silver coins into the hands of the ticket seller sitting in a cage-like iron car: "The two-yuan tickets are gone, buy the three-yuan tickets!" "Damn it, four-yuan tickets are four-yuan tickets, it's only once in a lifetime."... In just an instant, tickets of various colors exchanged for a solid drawer of large and small, colorful cash notes... I heard people say that Chinese people are too poor. But the performance in front of the "Dahua" site told us that Chinese people are not poor at all! It's really "the masters have plenty of banknotes and silver coins," extremely generous and unrestrained, without any stinginess or awkwardness!</p>
<p>This happened after a friend who had feasted his eyes told me with the most pleasant and nervous expression: "It's a pity to miss this circus. It's a waste to be alive! You should borrow money to see it once." So, at half past ten one Sunday morning, I ran happily to buy tickets with six dimes in my pocket, but I didn't get them. So, I stood on tiptoes, stretched my neck, and was squeezed into the last layer of the crowd, watching things with a curious heart. This matter is deeply engraved on my brain, and it is still clearly and deeply imprinted.</p>
<p>This big circus has been going on for more than a month, and it is said that the program has been changed to a brand new one. Friends who watched it a second time came back and were gesticulating and describing the "miracles" they had seen with great excitement, but since that time I returned without a ticket, I have been sitting on the bus and passing in front of the "Dahua" site every day, and I dare not have the slightest courage or determination to run to sell tickets again (it is also true that I have not had six dimes in my pocket by such a coincidence since then!). My heart is filled with the terror of a fierce lion jumping out of that "small window" and swallowing me in one gulp! But, every day is the same. On the open space in front of that "tent," there is always a large group of countless old masters, ladies, young masters, young ladies, and grandmothers busy and bustling. I suspect that they are the ones who came yesterday and have not dispersed.</p>

<h3>Who? Still Calling Me Fourth Sister!</h3>
<p>— Yousheng</p>
<p>She was wearing the latest style of long cheongsam, covered with a 1933 autumn coat, high-heeled leather shoes on her feet, making a clattering sound as she walked, and a leather briefcase given by the Bank Savings Association in her hand, walking forward excitedly.</p>
<p>Everyone on the street had to glance at her, unlike the days when she used to work. She is now the wife of an adjutant.</p>
<p>Now, when she sees the people she used to work with, she feels that they are all vulgar and lowly… She doesn't bother to chat with them. Even when some of her former co-workers see her and greet her, "Fourth Sister! You're back!" She is always unhappy to pay attention to them. Because now she is referred to as "Madam" by the servants. And these people who don't know the times, 丨 former co-workers 丨 insist on calling her "Fourth Sister." She feels that the three words "Fourth Sister" are such an ear-piercing term. If the madams she plays cards with now hear it, how unrefined would it be.</p>
<p>Once, she and her master 丨 husband 丨 returned to her mother's house. When they were about to reach their own door, she heard, "Fourth Sister! You're back!" Unhappily, she turned her head to look and saw Zhang Sanjie next door and Ling Si Nanny, 丨 former co-workers 丨 calling her. She was already very unhappy when she heard "Fourth Sister," let alone walking with her official husband today. So she lowered her head, ignored them, and went in. Zhang Sanjie and Ling Si Nanny called her very enthusiastically, but she didn't even glance at them. So they started scolding indirectly, to vent their resentment for not paying attention to them.</p>
<p>"Hum! Just because you have a few stinky coins, you're getting arrogant. Don't say that your husband is just a small official, even if you had a successful imperial exam and became a scholar, you would still pay respects to your neighbors when you returned home. Hum! Little X, who doesn't know your background?... "Zhang Sanjie scolded angrily. "When you were working, you even flirted with the foreman, and when you watched a play, you even hooked up with this little official. When your parents found out, they forcibly pulled someone out to be a matchmaker, shameless thing, a toad jumping on a scale wants to be arrogant, old woman, my status is higher than yours… Following an armed officer, you don't pay attention to people… "Ling Si Nanny echoed.</p>
<p>"That's right," Zhang Sanjie said again, "There's no self-respect or self-esteem. You have to have others call you Madam. You don't remember when you were working, you begged us to teach you how to work."</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>You're really shameless. Now you're putting on airs with us. What are you? You're all moldy. You don't even feel your own ass. You think it's interesting, but you have your stinky money… and we don't borrow yours. Calling you "Fourth Sister" is still giving you face. We can't call you Madam. Hum, numb, dreaming…"</p>
<p>"Sanjie, Si Nanny, what are you scolding about? Who offended you… "Grandma Bu came out to ask.</p>
<p>"Oh! Grandma Bu, I can't stand it. Little Four X and her husband came back, and Si Nanny and I kindly called her "Fourth Sister," but she ignored us and went in. Look! Are we angry or not… This bad thing, doesn't she even feel her own butt… Thinking we'll call her Madam, it's like dreaming a big dream in the middle of the night…" Zhang Sanjie and Ling Si Nanny said together.</p>
<p>"Sanjie, Si Nanny, it's getting late, go buy vegetables and cook rice. What's there to be angry about with this thing? Go, go!" Grandma Bu advised and went in.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>(3) Beautiful Girl</p>
<p>Those who were dreaming beautiful dreams have returned to the cruel reality. They didn’t notice the lonely ones who couldn't enjoy that moment of beauty, packing their bags and struggling to start today. I stared blankly at the eastern sun, which seemed like a beautiful girl smiling at me. Was she laughing at me for not enjoying a beautiful dream last night, or laughing at me for not having a hometown? Miss Bourgeois, you are just a beautiful girl without a beautiful soul! Are you laughing at me? The sun has unfolded a beautiful future, and I don't need a woman without a soul. When I looked closely, it was the woman who got on the bus with me last night. She wasn't smiling, and seemed to be hesitating about how to talk to me. But I didn't recognize her, although I tried my best to search for any sign that I knew her: her slender eyebrows, shining eyes, straight nose, curved lips, and her whole face. If her figure wasn't hidden by the small table, I would have searched every part of her body, because she looked so much like my older sister who I lost when I was little. Seeing her hesitant attitude, I looked at her with even more suspicion. She seemed to understand my confused mind, leaned closer and asked:</p>
<p>"Are you Li Qingping's younger brother?"</p>
<p>It was a small voice, but it was definitely my sister's tone.</p>
<p>"Are you Sister Min?"</p>
<p>"You recognize me!"</p>
<p>She smiled. I didn't pay attention to her tone and blurted out:</p>
<p>"You... how..."</p>
<p>"The air in the countryside is too stuffy, so I came to Shanghai to have some fun."</p>
<p>The misunderstanding was resolved. I was too paranoid. My sister is not a bourgeois miss. But she knew my surname, called me brother, and admitted that she was Sister Min. I still couldn’t remember who she was, and I looked out the window embarrassedly.</p>
<p>The beautiful sun has illuminated the world, and the train is approaching the platform of Shanghai North Station.</p>
<p>(4) Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>Stepping out of the station, she walked in front of me. She thought I was following her, jumped into a rickshaw and asked me:</p>
<p>"Where to?"</p>
<p>"To a hotel."</p>
<p>I said casually because I had no predetermined destination.</p>
<p>"I'm going to a hotel too."</p>
<p>She always spoke in a small voice. The rickshaw puller followed her instructions and ran forward.</p>
<p>My rickshaw puller also lifted the shafts and followed the rickshaw in front. It is said that Shanghai rickshaw pullers are smarter than primary school teachers in the inland areas. As long as you nod your head, he will know where you want to go. But this time he failed. I hadn't decided which hotel to go to, and I didn't intend to go to the same hotel as her, but I was too embarrassed to change the route after running for several blocks. Like a kidnapping, the rickshaw stopped in front of the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road. Thinking about it now, the rickshaw puller was still the victor.</p>
<p>I reluctantly followed her into the elevator.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're staying here too!"</p>
<p>I didn't expect these words to come from the beautiful girl's small lips. The elevator boy glanced at me with contempt. Did he think I was a despicable person?</p>
<p>"Damn! You soulless woman, just because you look like my lost sister, don't look down on me with your petty bourgeois consciousness. Watch out, I will get revenge!"</p>
<p>I glared at her like an enemy,</p>
<p>On the second floor, I escaped from the elevator.</p>

<h3>A Woman Who Dares to Speak Fairly (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fù</p>
<p>She said that the main reason for divorce lies in women. "Preparation" is the only remedy she proposes.</p>
<p>"I hear all kinds of discussions from all directions, studying the reasons for the alarming increase in divorce rates, but unfortunately, no one mentions the 'unpreparedness' of women. Modern wives spend their days playing mahjong, drinking, and living in beauty salons, or driving cars and galloping in the suburbs, showing their indifference to family affairs everywhere. I am not a hypocrite. I am not saying that these things are not allowed. But I think these things should only be enjoyed with limitations. It is best for a wife to first act like a wife, and then do other things. If a woman is capable, she has plenty of time to play after handling all the household affairs properly. I'm just afraid of a woman who has no ability to handle household affairs and is only interested in playing.</p>
<p>"Not long ago, I was playing mahjong at a friend's house. By five o'clock in the afternoon, the mahjong game was long over, and I wanted to leave. Everyone said it was too early. I said I had to go home to prepare dinner. Everyone was surprised when they heard this. A movie star still has to go home to prepare dinner in the evening! Isn't that a joke? But for me personally, it's not a joke. In addition to filming at the studio, I personally supervise the preparation of dinner every day. I even do it myself sometimes.</p>
<p>Later, one of those people who laughed at me the most actually divorced her husband. Her divorce was secretly advocated by her husband. According to what people told me, that lady had been married for many years and had never entered the kitchen once. She had never taken care of her husband's clothes, shoes, and socks, and had never been to the vegetable market to buy vegetables. Her husband often ate dinner alone at home, while his wife was outside playing mahjong, attending tea parties, or even going on long trips. Of course, being the husband of such a woman is more painful than being single, because he has a family in name, but in reality he only has the financial burden, and he cannot have any contact with other women. This is such a painful thing!</p>
<p>"If I only pointed out the reasons for the prevalence of divorce without giving a remedy, I would definitely be criticized. The remedy I want to point out now is the word 'preparation'. Every woman should receive some kind of domestic training before marriage. She should know that she should treat her husband like she treats her boss, and she must be punctual. When the boss is in a bad mood, the people working under him can only be patient. A wife should treat her husband in the same way. In short, she should try to become a wife who is worthy of being called a 'wife'.</p>
<p>"I am putting what I said above into practice. I am very happy now, but I cannot predict that I will always be so. It is not that I do not have the determination to create and maintain a happy family, but it is really because a person's future is very difficult to determine. I think that when the joy is exhausted and the relationship between husband and wife cannot be maintained, divorce is the only way out. But every married man and woman should try their best to avoid all disputes that hinder family harmony, and try their best to create family happiness." (The End)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "42nd Street"</h3>
<p>— Líng Hè</p>
<p>In terms of this film itself, the organization of the story is very tight. The relationship between Tan Ning, played by George Brent, and Bai Ji, played by Ruby Keeler, is the most ingenious, followed by Dorothy, played by Bebe Daniels, who discovers the intimacy between the two. Naturally, this is entirely a story of love entanglement. But within this scope, this story is very good. Obviously, the playwright easily exposes the lascivious golden stench of modern society: A rich man, in order to love an actress and make her a star, does not hesitate to organize a song and dance troupe with huge sums of money. The actress, on the one hand, is in love with the rich man, and on the other hand, she is completely entangled with her lover. The director of the song and dance troupe, in order to please the rich man and prevent him from withdrawing his funds, even threatened the actress's lover with despicable means. And the actress's lover, watching his lover getting along with the rich man, then associates with another actress. As mentioned above, this is not only a dispute between men and women, but also can be said to be an epitome of the decline of social morality. Although this is not a serious treatment of social issues, it is also a true exposure of modern society. As for the playwright's making the actress resist the rich man and give up vanity and marry her original lover, it is naturally brave and based on the principle of love supremacy. But he also refuses to ignore the magic of the rich man's money. In the rich man's arms, there will inevitably be Anne to replace Dorothy's position. At the same time, the screenwriter expresses dissatisfaction with this transaction of lust and flesh, not only in the two scenes in the hotel that fully express it, but also in the words of the director, Warner Baxter: "Until tomorrow morning, please temporarily forget about love and have a good rest." (Main idea)</p>
<p>Regarding the director, I think with a good script, the director doesn't have to worry too much. Naturally, the song and dance performance on the final stage is undoubtedly a pure expression of American film art.</p>
<p>Now I want to point out the advantages of this film in a scattered way, in the places that still leave an impression in my memory.</p>
<p>The photography is excellent, with bright light and shadow, and flexible lens angles. There are many beautiful pictures, which shows the special effect of the camera. We certainly do not recognize that the forest of thighs is a manifestation of culture, but the photographer shows great intelligence in those few shots.</p>
<p>The color configuration of the costumes is also very good. The black and white colors are distinct, and in that opera scene, it is like white flowers shining in a completely black space. In particular, the all-white trousers, with a few black buttons, are even more wonderful.</p>
<p>In a scene on the train sleeping car, when everyone closed the curtains to go to bed, a black man picked up his shoes and walked past. The so-called newlywed bride took out a pair of shoes from the curtain. Slowly dropped on the ground, its expression of the intimacy of the newly married couple, is truly unique.</p>
<p>Bebe Daniels is the best actor. That charming song and dance scene, surrounded by four men, is extremely pure and hot. In addition, after hitting the rich man in the hotel, driving out other women, and then tearfully making a phone call, until opening the door and passionately kissing her lover, Bai Ji runs in and becomes jealous because of it, all are the most intelligent performance skills.</p>
<p>Warner Baxter is naturally the best too. Directing the opera while sick, exhausted, and treating people rudely, he consistently grasps the characteristics of the characters in the play. It is even more wonderful to eavesdrop on the audience's comments and smile happily outside the door when the show is over.</p>
<p>Ruby Keeler, who plays Bai Ji, also has great achievements, consistently showing the style of a girl, which is not something that ordinary people can do. All the other people are extremely dedicated, especially the rich man.</p>
<p>This review is written very hastily, but from this, you can generally see a glimpse of this work. It is suitable for those who are tired to have some entertainment, who says it is not appropriate?</p>
<h3>Review of "Myrt and Marge"</h3>
<p>— Mó Ěr</p>
<p>The story of "Myrt and Marge" is of course very ordinary. A rich young man, for the sake of a singer, actually plots to become the manager of a song and dance troupe, which to some extent shows the power of money. Of course, I will never be like a mechanical "reviewer", thinking that money is guilty. Economy can create crimes, develop crimes, just because of its imbalance. Money only exists objectively.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that the director's emphasis is on "interest". When deciding to adopt this story, he already had his eyes on this aspect. Therefore, he not only exaggerates it on the screen, but also adds many unnecessary comedies. And he uses all his strength to express this comedy. Humor originally needs to be cleverly obtained by chance, and it is readily available. Once it is pretentious, it loses its interest. This is the fatal flaw of "Myrt and Marge".</p>
<p>Many films often fail to grasp the central clue of the story in the development of the story. Originally, "material" has been cut into "theme", and many branches and leaves have been deleted, but the miscellaneousness of personnel and the progress of time cannot but be piled up with countless scenes. In these countless scenes, the audience must be able to "watch" it in a systematic way, and they must not let the audience be described by the screen and distract their attention. Now "Myrt and Marge" fully has this shortcoming. The triviality of the script, coupled with the messy editing, although the audience does not feel fragmented and disjointed, how can it be obtained?</p>
<p>But in small places, special and individual shots, there are better places. Like several stage scenes, the placement of the lens positions, and the control of the distance are very strange and appropriate.</p>
<p>As for the underground fighting scene, it is expressed by the use of sound. This is of course common in sound films. In addition, the application of scenes with different sounds and images is still appropriate.</p>
<h3>Bebe Daniels in Europe</h3>
<p>— Huá Míng</p>
<p>This time Bebe Daniels went to Europe to join the Gaumont Film Company and made a big splash in England. Her first British film at Gaumont Film Company is a big song and dance film. In this film, Bebe Daniels has extremely exquisite songs. Gaumont Film Company, in order to find a suitable partner for Bebe Daniels, searched everywhere. As a result, they found Walter Widdop, a famous singer who enjoyed a high reputation in the British stage circle. He was famous throughout Europe among British singers. It was a coincidence that he joined Gaumont Film Company and co-starred with Bebe Daniels this time. He did not want to enter the film industry, but co-starring in a film with Bebe Daniels was what he dreamed of. One of the other actors is British playwright Folk de Valke, and the other is Claude Hulbert, the brother of Jack Hulbert, who became famous in "Spring River Flower Moon Night". Gaumont Film Company, in order to respect Bebe Daniels, these supporting roles were all selected by Bebe Daniels herself.</p>
<p>This time, Bebe Daniels is in Europe, greatly vying for face in the American film industry. British film industry celebrities praised Bebe Daniels more than once. Some people said that she would not return to Hollywood this year, but Bebe Daniels' husband, Ben Lyon, absolutely denied it. He said that Bebe would shoot at most two films in England and then return to Hollywood.</p>
<h3>"Fragrant Grass Beauty" to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>After Chen Kengran's first work in the Star Film Company, "The Road to Fitness", was released, he continued to work hard. At the same time, he started filming "Exhibition" and "Fragrant Grass Beauty". "Fragrant Grass Beauty" has been completed a month ago and submitted to the Film Inspection Committee for approval, and will be released in the New Light Grand Theater this month. One of the leading roles in the film is Xia Peizhen, a country girl, whose expressions have long been famous in the country. Xie Yunqing, who specializes in playing villain roles, plays an upright worker in this film and has a special success. The play writes about the home of a worker in a tobacco factory, which is a realistic work.</p>
<h3>"Good Harvest" Released Before Editing</h3>
<p>"Good Harvest", written and directed by Li Pingqian, is currently being rushed to be connected after completing the location shooting in the Soviet Union three times. However, the matter was heard by the Hollywood film industry. It is regarded as a masterpiece of Chinese films to defeat imported films. They also rushed to shoot a foreign "Good Harvest" and transported it to Shanghai to be released in the Great Light Grand Theater. Director Li went to the theater to visit once yesterday after hearing the news. It is said that the film also depicts the tragic economic organization of the countryside being destroyed by capitalism. However, compared with the Chinese "Good Harvest", it is still far inferior.</p>
<h3>Movie Novel Fragrant Grass Beauty (3)</h3>
<p>— Tián Fū</p>
<p>(5) One person's "crime"!</p>
<p>Another year has passed. The days are gradually sinking into difficult circumstances, and sorrow is only growing in the hearts of Wang Ada's family. Now, there is another mouth to feed in the family, and Ada's wife has given birth to another child. Now, the family has lost another person who produces, and the daughter's business in the factory has stopped. Washing rice and washing vegetables, the woman always sighs at the rarely full rice basket. "After counting and counting, we earn so little every month, we can't live in Shanghai!"</p>
<p>"But we can't live in the countryside either!"</p>
<p>So a string of sorrow deeply locked the brows of the mother and daughter. Who knew that the company was always losing money, and at this time, the news of wage cuts was announced. The situation is also true, and the company can't survive. The foreman explained, please help everyone.</p>
<p>Ada's brother shouted loudly: "We only earn a dozen yuan a month, and we still have to deduct it? We use the same strength, can we eat less rice?" Ada felt helpless. He was afraid of losing his job, and he was willing to accept the wage cut.</p>
<p>The younger brother supported the strike, and the older brother opposed it. Because of the difference of opinion, the brothers also quarreled.</p>
<p>"Oldest brother, let me tell you: you expect foreigners not to rob Chinese people's business, and bosses not to be harsh on workers, that's impossible, don't dream!"</p>
<p>"But I don't agree with the strike anyway!"</p>
<p>"We all have the same mind, we don't want our own brother to be like this, no wonder people say you are a running dog!"</p>
<p>The two were quarreling, quarreling; a dozen detectives and policemen pushed the door in. "Is this the strike leaflet that you sent?"</p>
<p>The second child nodded proudly. The house immediately became chaotic, and after a frantic search, the two brothers were taken away.</p>
<p>"Inciting a strike": The second child was sentenced to two years in prison under this charge. A family of four, so only Ada was left to desperately support them.</p>
<p>(6) For Food</p>
<p>Unfortunate things all came: The Da Zhonghua Tobacco Factory finally closed down. Eating, living, now living is like walking on the Naihe Bridge.</p>
<p>Heaven has pity! Fortunately, the daughter found a job: it is said that she works in some kind of health company. He doesn't understand what it is. Ask her daughter, she whispered: "It's a kind of business with some medicinal properties, I work the night shift." Still don't understand; but never mind, anyway, it's for food!</p>
<p>The days are so reluctantly passed, and I do some odd jobs myself. It was one evening a month or so later, catching up with her daughter going out to work, dressed up like a modern young lady. Ada was stunned and called her: "Look at yourself, what are you dressed up like!"</p>
<p>The daughter did not reply and finally left. The father's heart was always uneasy: just because a girl has a job, can she be so wasteful? He can't stand it!</p>
<p>The factory originally said it was temporarily closed, but the news of the factory opening never came. One day, he went to the factory gate to inquire about the news and came back with a sad heart, but he found a strange scene in his daughter's room: the daughter was putting on makeup and applying it to her face, and a boy in a suit was sitting next to her.</p>
<p>Ada felt a chill run down from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, but a surge of anger rushed from the soles of his feet to the top of his head. He gritted his teeth and ran over and slapped her! A slap in the face. (To be continued)</p>
