<h3 id="c13">各國對立中之軍縮　實 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>英法兩國近又進行談論軍備縮小問題。據巴黎電傳。英法會談情形甚佳。同時軍縮會議主席漢特森與美代表台維斯。亦同車赴巴黎。似軍縮會議在沉寂巳久之中。又有一線新希望。然而海軍問題。在英法會談中。并未提及。則英法縱令能成立相當的諒解。於軍縮前途亦未必有多大補益。蓋英法於陸軍軍備競爭。雖無絶對利害不相容之點。而爭覇歐洲之心。則皆未忘。且爲環境關係。一時接返之意見。難保不無變遷。故會談情形甚佳之。說殊未可驟據爲樂觀也。</p>
<p>歐洲糾紛所以愈見激劇之故。少數民族糾紛。固爲其主因之一。而法德兩國之對立。實爲歐戰以來最重要之病根也。軍備縮小爲國際合作之先聲。尤爲世界和平之基礎然而法國爲防止德國軍國主義復興。故竭力主張（安全保障。」換言之即非有確實保證。决不肯減縮其現有軍備。加以波蘭。捷克。等國。皆聽命於法於是法更不能不預備强大之陸軍。以圖永遠控制歐洲。惟在德國方面。希特勒黨以努力取消凡爾賽和約之說。激動德人之情感。而取得政權。近於軍備平等之要求。更見急切。擴張軍備之態度。愈見堅决。設使法國不肯修改凡爾賽和約。對軍備問題亦不肯讓步。則德國將步武日本之後而退出國際聮盟。亦意計中事。其他。奥匈兩國之態度。非特爲世界所注目。抑且爲法意逐鹿之塲。而捷克。猶哥。羅馬尼亞。諸國對此。又莫不有相當之密切關係。即此數者之糾紛已甚複雜而無從解决矣。</p>
<p>再從美日方面言之。華府條約。轉瞬一九三六年即屆期滿。而日本則正極力擴大其海軍軍事預算。并公然增設航空機八隊。新近且在小笠原島上。建築巨大飛行。塲其用意不外兩端第一在攻勢方面。美果欲發展遠東市塲。立</p>
<p>足於亞東。則與日本之亞洲門羅主義不容。日必於適當時機。舉美國在東方勢力而蹴翻之。甚至奪取菲列濱關島。且進一步奪取夏威夷。以便南窺澳洲。東伸鐵手於南美。亦未可料。第二在守勢方面。日本旣在我東北得勢。欲徐圖整頓。使東方盡入其掌握。亦非保持其海軍優勢不可。且近來航空軍隊發達。日欲保全西太平洋上之交通與日本本土之安全。又非有强大之空軍不可。故依小笠原島爲根據。以抵禦美國空軍之西來。亦即所以獨覇東亞之本意也。</p>
<p>英國在東方有根深蒂固之經濟勢力。有香港爲其海軍前衛。但與美國之絶大空軍勢力。日本之優秀潛艇相較乃爲三足鼎立中最柔弱乏力。之一足。然而英吉利對於利害研究。亦異常分明。豈肯坐視遠東利益爲日本所奪取。故先之以英帝國内經濟聯盟。用闗稅以制日。繼以海軍建艦競爭。冀陷日本於窮苦之境。日本乃由是而益積極備戰。綜上以觀。各國對立之形勢如此。尙有談論軍縮之餘地耶。</p>
<p>故吾謂世界一般形勢險惡。巳至不可挽救之境。太平洋上風雲緊急。在在顯示戰禍之已迫乎眉睫。吾人處此迫切環境中。又將何以自存乎。</p>

<p>市運會男子排球决賽復旦對滬江、下午四時半在中華田徑塲舉行、復旦飛將軍曹廷　重行出山、主持中樞、雖身體肥胖、不能跳躍殺球、然調度各方、得力不少、是以滬江雖强、不得不甘拜下風、四局分勝負、復旦保持常勝軍之雄威、</p>
<p>復旦二十一比十一　二十一比十五　十九比廿一　二十一比十八　滬江</p>
<p>獲上海全市運動會排球錦標之復旦隊（啟昌攝）</p>
<h3 id="c233">第一局復旦凶猛 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>開始交鋒、滬江頗示慌張、復旦亦少特殊表演六比六後、復旦曹廷贊發球凶猛、佔據上風以十一比七調換塲面後、復旦鋒芒突盛、前排程明覺與曹廷贊攔網得法、丘廣爕得機騰空猛殺銳不可當、分數進至十七比七、滬江在嚴里威脅之下、殊少活動、加以後方陣容紊亂、被復且以二千一比十一勝、</p>
<h3 id="c234">第二局格殺利害 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>第二局起、復旦張羣光發球、網上防守嚴密、滬江無機可乘、成九典三之比復旦又佔勝勢、滬江極力振作、盧康元振臂疾呼、恊力格殺每中要害、分數進七比九　但仍被復旦以十一比七勝上半局、易地再戰形勢愈形激烈、丘廣爕與盧康元各顯身手、針鋒相對、球勢往返、有如砲彈、惟復旦始終佔優、滬江挽回乏術、復旦再以二十一比十五勝、</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>序　九一八不出特刋，並非貪懶，郤是靜默三分鐘之意。茲於此慘痛紀念的第三朝上，在痛定思痛之餘，驀地來這麽一個特刋，呌做（無題）。（無題）云者，非與那舊詩人们專寫風懷的豓體詩同科，而如佛所云（不可說不可說）也。是爲序。</p>
<h3 id="c272">幹 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 君惕</p>
<p>九一八紀念日已過去了，我们痛定思痛，還應當捫心自問：我们的大好河山，無端被敵人奪去。雖然敵人是犯着强盜行爲，不齒於人類，但他這種强盜行爲，不敢施之於别國，而竟施之於我们，這是不是我们的奇恥大辱？</p>
<p>我们所喪失的大好河山，原駐着十數萬大軍；而來奪取的敵人，只有幾千個，這是不是我们的奇恥大辱？</p>
<p>我们所喪失的大好河山，已經二年：在這二年中，我们不但不能收回來，且繼續的喪失，這是不是我们的奇恥大辱？</p>
<p>無疑的，這是我们的奇恥丨這是我们的大辱！我们不要怨；也不要尤人。所以不要說我们是天生的苦命民族；也不要說國聯不是眞心扶助我们：也不要說政府不努力；也不要說軍人不盡職。中華民國是我们四萬萬人民所有，從我们手中喪失，就當從我们手中收回。那些長吁短歎，呼救乞援，都是弱者的表示。</p>
<p>我们應當把整個的精神和肉體，完全獻出來；更應當把四萬萬人的心，併成一個。那麽，要文幹的話，敵人的貨品，無論如何的美，無論如何的廉，也換不了我们一個錢；要武幹事話，敵人的武器，無論如何的利，無論如何的多，也打不盡我四萬萬。</p>
<p>換句話說，我们無論如何，總應當幹。幹有文幹，武幹，兩種，文幹就是不買敵人的貨，武幹就是和敵人拚死。</p>
<p>我親愛的同胞呵！武幹要你们去拚死，也許捨不得；文幹不但不要你们去拚死，還替你们來省錢，爲何也不肯發狠幹一下呵？</p>
<h3 id="c273">九一八夜祭 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>清早起來，没洗臉，就獨自個兒上山崗去採了一撮黄色的野花和血色的野花回來，養在水裏。這一天，没有看書，也没有動筆，老是悶在屋角裏，哀愁的心緒，哀愁的思想。</p>
<p>默默無語地等着，等着夜的來到。夜，果然帶着悲哀陰黯的臉來了，秋風在紙窗上開始嗚咽的啼泣。老媽子把那支燭台放在靠窗的桌上，火舌不住的跳着，屋子裏更顯得陰森。</p>
<p>於是，便開門跑了出去，帶着那撮黄色的血色的野花。</p>
<p>悄悄地，悄悄地走到了岔道口的那塊亂塜地，站住了，放下了花，深深地對亂塜行了一個最敬禮，抬起頭來的時候，兩行熱涙就没關没閂的掛下啦。</p>
<p>『殉難同胞的幽靈，也許是不會怪我没帶酒來吧，我今夜以至誠的心靈，和這束無名的野花，敬獻在你们之前。自從前年的九月十八的夜晚，到目下己是足足兩個年頭了。非但没有收復一寸一尺的失地，反而又袖手奉送掉幾千萬方里的河山，一二八淞滬又添上新的創痕華北又發生了種種隠痛，你们在九泉之下，總也在痛哭流涕的吧？這並不是我们辜負了你们的忠勇就義，實在呵，現實的環境使我们有有國不能愛，有血無處流……』</p>
<h3 id="c274">痛心話 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>九一八那天，下了鎭天的雨，雖說這是天氣上的轉變，也許是中國的國魂，在號啕大哭吧！它哭着不肖的黄帝子孫，坐視東北的國土，淪亡了兩年，還在那裡酣歌恒舞，好像是没有這回事。</p>
<p>亡國的民族，只要他们的心不死，說不定有光復故土的日了。惟有心死的民族，纔淪於萬刦不復之地，國雖未亡，其可哀尤過於亡國之民。　　「烏衣巷口夕陽斜，是别姓人家的新盡梁。」這詞句兒是描寫明代的亡國之恨，何等的沉痛？今日裡翹首北望，泣下沾襟，可憐我们的萬里雄闗，也變做了别姓人家的新　梁了！我自言自語地說到這裏，竟嗚咽的哭起來了。</p>
<p>我們這些後死者，究竟何以對那殉難的忠勇的將士和一班無辜被難的同胞？</p>
<h3 id="c275">防範不周 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>昨天我們的同居張老太太，陡然在家擊案爭噪，我便走去聽聽。原來這位張老太太打從街上回來，看見舊貨店裏掛着一把銅吊，仔細一看，原是自己家裹的東西，怎會移在舊貨攤上，不由大怒起來，氣冲冲的跑到家裏，不問情由，大噪大鬧，弄得伊的媳婦莫明其妙。後來據伊媳婦說：先　確有這把銅吊，因爲用得舊了，已買了新的替用，把舊吊子擱置起來。現在發現在舊貨攤上，就想着舊吊子了，所以要追查。張老太太鬧的理由是如此，但旣是還要這舊吊子，事前應該注意，及至在舊貨攤上發現，方始鬧起來了，然而任你鬧到如何田地，權利已屬於舊貨攤主了。　　莫說一家人家如此，就是國家未始不是加此，你瞧；法佔九小島，日佔八小島，在未被他人奪取之前，始終没有聽見有九小島八小島，及至被人奪去之後，方鬧將起來，然而任你鬧得怎樣，東西畢竟被人奪去，應該事前防範，遂不致被人覬觎。這位張老太太的事情與我们國家小島事件是同樣的事實。</p>
<p>那末我们中國不僅是這幾個小島，小島還有，應當趕快防備假來。不必被人奪去之後方才曉得是自己東西，要曉得東西到了别人手裏，不容易奪回來的。比了貓嘴裹挖鰍還要難上十倍。如果不加防範，被人奪去之後，任你抗議，也無濟於事的。實則都是防範不周的緣故。</p>
<h3 id="c276">肉搏曾蜀鵑 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>沉寂陰黯的荒郊，凄凉漠漠地，曝露着猙獰兇惡的面目：星月掩蔽了明凈的光輝，陰森恐怖的殺氣，籠罩着慘澹的宇宙。</p>
<p>熱血奔騰的愛國健兒，盡在匍匐在潮濕的戰壕裏，屏息不動地緊握着鋒利的大刀，靜待着敵宼的襲擊。</p>
<p>敵人的野砲突地發着咆哮，在健兒们的週遭爆裂；敵人的飛機忽然擲下巨彈、在戰壕上的附近轟炸。血肉隨着彈片濺射，塵上捲着烟硝飛揚，那撲鼻的血腥，那纍纍的白骨，在凄迷的霧靄裹，狠悲慘地曝露着戰爭的殘酷！</p>
<p>萬惡的敵人，仗持它猛烈的火力，侵入我森嚴的陣地。這般英勇絶倫的戰士，祗一聲怒吼，彷彿像山崩在裂！大家從戰壕裏，像生龍活虎般騰身躍出，向敵宼核心猛撲，衝擊！但見白刄飛舞寒光閃爍，人仰馬翻，赤血迸流；敵人的頭顱隨着鋒鋩的利刄飛墮，敵虜的鮮血隨着閃曜的刀光濺灑！祗一轉瞬間，這廣漠的戰場，己經是屍骸狼藉血膏原野了！　　殘暴的敵人，滿以爲夜襲必獲奇勝；誰知因我忠勇的將士肉搏，而遭受深切的創痛。於是每當那漆黑的夜晚他们就深懷着死亡的恐怖而不敢再來嘗試這鋒利的白刄的滋味。</p>
<p>這伏屍遍地的疆塲，這陰森恐怖的戰地，因爲這辛辣的肉搏的賜予，敵人也歛縮了覬觎的野心，畏慄得不敢正眼窺視。因此這轟炸砍殺的戰場，竟一變而爲沉寂冷靜的原野：被慘澹陰森的空氣，把這灰黯的宇宙，像網羅般籠罩，望不見星月的光輝。</p>
<h3 id="c277">缅懷故土 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 超冶</p>
<p>病去如抽絲，無異日坐愁城。閒來翻讀閱微草堂筆記，突見左列一則：</p>
<p>「余校勘秘籍，凡四至避暑山莊：丁未以冬，戊申以秋，已酉以夏，壬子以春，四時之勝胥覽焉。每泛舟至文津閣；山容水意，皆出天然，樹色衆聲，都非塵境。陰晴朝暮，千態萬狀，雖一鳥一花，亦皆入畫。其尤異者；細草沿坡帶谷，皆茸茸如綠罽，高不數寸，齊如裁翦，無一莖參差長短者，苑丁謂之規矩草」。出宫牆纔數步，即　鬚滋蔓矣。豈非天生嘉卉，以待宸游哉？」</p>
<p>循讀一過，觸目驚心！此身似在斯間。按避暑山莊；在喜峯口外，俗稱之熱河行宫是也。其中景色，已經右一百卅七字描摹殆盡！如此之經之營之，巧奪天工之大好所在。惜已被不足二百名之敵兵，不折一矢，整隊前進，泰然佔有之矣！而今而後，凡吾中華民族，欲遨游於此者，除讀斯記而夢游外，其惟有待於收復乎？缅懷故土，悲極而滬。豈天生嘉卉，不待胡游，必待夷游哉？</p>
<h3 id="c278">大刀關雄　黄克威 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>北平城的一條大街上，擁擠着無數的人，白綁腿的警察穿梭似的走着，黑色的木棍，把他们攔在街邊，讓出一條很闊的大路；他们都點起了脚尖，伸長脖子，向外瞧着，但觸到眼裏的，却儘是些人頭；毛剌剌的，光溜溜的，戴大笠帽的，白布包頭的，……</p>
<p>紅太陽撒下一團火，頭上的汗水，都給燒滾啦！一縷縷的熟氣向上冒，但他们要瞧一瞧那隊從容赴死的戰士，一些没有厭倦和疲困的狀態。他们期待着，丨丨期待着那爲國家，爲民族拚命的隊伍來到。</p>
<p>（看哪！咱们的戰士來了。）人叢　起了呼聲，於是，大家都不約而同的鼓掌着，歡呼着隆隆地，起了個焦雷似的。</p>
<p>一列長蛇形的隊伍，終於在幾萬隻手摇動裹，大踏步走進了街。他们都用青綢子包着頭，玄色的短襖，八字鈕緊扣着，黑綁腿，草蒲鞋；肐膞上架着闊頭大刀，亮亮地，和日光輝映着，刀　上紮着紅綾綢，繡着兩個大字：一誓死）！</p>
<p>領隊的是個魁梧的漢子，圓眼晴，　嘴巴，紫臉膛，絡腮鬍子，渾軍綠色，這丨丨是關雄　　沉默地，臉上的肌肉緊綳着。他们離去了生的界限，向死的路上挺進！</p>
<p>（大刀隊萬歳）！（大刀隊萬歳？從某個人的嘴裏溜出來，雄壯地。</p>
<p>關雄臉上的肌肉一動，微微露出一絲笑容，兩顆瞳子注視着大刀，似乎在對它說；（勇敢此，多砍幾顆敵人的頭顱）</p>
<p>草蒲鞋塌塌地響着，踏過水門江的，碎石子的，泥濘的，崎嶇的路，終於，到了前缐。　　昏夜，大月亮埋在烏雲裡，掙扎着。丨丨着，溜出一線暗淡的光，射到灰色的戰壕裡，　着關雄灰色的面孔。他把闊板帶紮一紮緊，的了口氣，渾身的勁兒運在兩條肐膊上，他把大刀試了試，蹲下身去，對他的同伴說：（咱的祖宗丨丨關雲長。仗着它破黄巾賊，斬顔良，誅文醜，殺六將。咱的祖父丨丨關勝。也仗着它剿過梁山泊，傳到了咱的手裡，就把它埋吸了。咱眞慚愧，對不起這把刀，也對不起咱没祖宗）。</p>
<p>轟的！太陽牌砲彈從他的頭上掠過，同伴連忙拉他臥下；他摸了摸腦袋，依舊蹲着說：（今夜咱好將敵人的頭開刀了，敎這把長久没有吃葷的刀，嘗嘗異味）。正說着。一盞明亮的小燈，在天空裡盤旋着丨丨這是飛機。</p>
<p>「臥倒」，連長尖銳地喊着。兩條閃電似的探照燈向下一照，接着就是一顆偌大的炸彈，很快地飛下。</p>
<p>轟隆！泥土夾着石子跳舞，火藥氣塞滿了戰壕。闗雄把鼻子悶在膝蓋上，血在沸騰！（他媽的！怎麽還不衝上去呢）？</p>
<p>「慢？沉着應戰」。大砲聲接連地怒吼起來，槍聲助着威亂呌，飛蝗似的彈子，打着哨子；從那邊飛到這裡，從這裡飛到那邉，鑽進泥裡，鑽進戰士们的身子。</p>
<p>「衝喲！弟兄们」。關雄怒吼着，把大門向地下一按，趁勢跳出了戰壕，接着猛虎似的大刀隊，勇敢地向前衝？</p>
<p>那邊的機關槍，呑進了槍彈，摇着頭吐出來，噴到了一批，但又衝上了一批，不斷地，不斷地。關雄把牙子咬得格格地馨着，他走近了幾步，摸出手溜彈丢去，轟的一聲，機槍歪了頭，半條矮腿飛到了他的面前。他獰笑着，把大刀一指，大聲喊：「前進喲！前進才有生路」。</p>
<p>敵兵，擁出戰壕，於是兩方混戰起來了；雪高的大刀，剌刀，緋紅的熱血，槍彈，砍掉的頭顱，肐膊，大腿，慘呼聲，呐喊聲，攪做了一團。</p>
<p>關雄。他掄起大刀，瘋狂地殺來殺去，把他祖傳的花刀，使了個勁，他破翻了許多敵兵，他也疲倦地倒下地去。</p>
<p>狼嘷似的機槍聲，漸漸地消沉下去，旭日衝破了朦朧的嘵霧，却生生地露出哭喪着的臉，這時候，關勝從死屍堆裡爬起身來。他揉了揉眼睛，瞧着身邊砍掉了半個腦蓋的敵兵，他感覺了什麽似的颤抖着？他提起那柄破缺了口的大刀，踏着血跡，踏着死屍，尙那光明的旭日奔去。</p>

<p>（一）食不厭精膾不厭細　吃飯要吃衛生米，換句話講，就是要吃糙一些的米，糙米中間，富有維太命，所以飯米是愈粗愈好。可見飯米是以粗爲原則的。可是偶然到人家去吃飯，那麽　就一些，精的只好不討厭了。其實他老人家何嘗是歡喜吃精米呢？粗魚大肉，口中幸福，可見肴饌在乎烹調得法，過分細小，吃來决不爽快，决不過騐。不過到人家去應酬時候，將就一點，只好不討厭他，其實他老人家何嘗是歡喜細肴呢？　　（二）魚餒而肉敗不食色惡不食臭惡不食　孔子的飲食，極講衛生，魚爛了，肉腐了，菜肴變色了，變味了，他是絶對不肯吃的。現在有許多飲食店把隔宿東西，隨便出賣，眞是罪該萬死。孔子知道了，一定要呌小子鳴鼓而攻之。　　　（三）失飪不食　孔老夫子很注意於烹飪之學，太生固然不好，太熟也是不行。好好一碗蔬菜，半生不熟，固然是不易下咽，可是煑得熖爛，變了黄色，維太命早已失去，他老人家一定要摇頭不食了。</p>
<p>（四）不時不食　冬天吃冰淇漣，夏天吃菊花鍋，固然是不時。還有如四五月的瓜，九十月的月餅，不是時令没有到，便是早已過時，他老人家都是不要吃的。</p>
<p>總之這位孔老夫子，是一個極經濟，極衛生，極合科學的食品專家，我想冠生園的洗老板，以及飲食店中的經理，乃至廚房，都要研究研究論語，或者出品還要受人歡迎咧。</p>

<p>— 季搏</p>
<p>「魚」在民食上佔有極重要的地位，以其鮮美肥嫩，其味無窮。隨各人嗜好的不同，烹調之法各異。尙有許多地方的特產，如松江　，黄河鯉，京江　木凟䰾，嘉定甲魚，太湖三角峯，（鍽之一種）尤爲人津津所樂道。「魚」味可口，是大家共認的，俗語說「大塊魚大塊肉」亦可見「魚」爲饕餮者之認爲佳餚。而他所含之蛋白質生活素和脂肋，比諸半，豚，鷄卵有同等以上的含量，則其營養價值可知。且魚富水分，肉質的軟度，遠非鳥獸肉所能及，不但烹調之可以經濟時間，且於消化上亦非常的迅速，其養分之被吸收也自易。我國海岸綫最長，漁場最廣，加之黄河，長江，珠江三大川横貫數省，河港紛歧，湖沼星羅，藴藏魚類的豐富，世界各國，鮮於比倫，其供給量之多，自在意中。他的價值，（在滬埠）除一部分昻貴外，在小黄魚大黄魚黑魚帶魚各魚漁期的時候，及各種鱏魚，亦不過同蔬菜的價值差不多。魚旣具有富滋養，易消化，適於嗜好，價值亦廉的，各種條件，確爲一種狠重要促進食慾的副食物。且是產於我國的領海以及長江大河，的確是貨眞價實的國貨。却不道近年來時有舶來品的「魚」混跡國内。　　士蕚籬笆打得緊野狗鑽勿進！</p>
<p>我们旣知魚類關係人生之重大，則應重視國内之漁業。現在我國的漁業，爲强鄰覬觎，領海以内，外輪侵入，濫捕魚類，致出產我國之魚變爲舶來。海味鹹魚，國貨雖不少，然亦受外貨之壓迫。内地江河，則亦爲詳細調查，（日人每歳來華調查淡水漁業前有岸上謙吉調查長江上游魚病死四川）意存侵略　野心勃勃。倘再不度補救，遲早間必有（食無魚）之嘆。希望國貨公司進貨時和讀者吃魚時，注意他是否國人捕來的魚，要緊要緊。</p>

<p>— 枕</p>
<p>豆腐，這是種純粹的國貨飲食品，吾國留學生某君，且曾以之在海外獲利無數：牠的歷史，首創者爲淮南王劉安：牠的原料是水和大豆，大豆爲含蛋白質原豐富之植物，故豆腐之營養，雖較肉卵稍遜，而較牛乳則爲優，蓋蛋白質之吸收，於豆腐爲（九六　），牛乳爲（九三％）而肉卵則（九八％）是也，又豆腐一塊有兩公斤重者，則其生活力量爲蛋白質（一二八）公分，脂肪力（六八）公分，炭水化合物（一四）公分，而可生熟量一一九○加路里，幾佔吾人每日所需熱量之半，故豆腐誠滋補之食物；且本草復云豆腐除清可愛外，可以有寛中，益氣，和脾胃，消脹膈，除大腸濁氣，及清熱清血之妙用，是豆腐且復作藥用矣。</p>
<p>豆腐雖爲吾们日常的食品，但是牠的製法恐不知者尙夥；其實是很簡單的，不過要做得白嫩，那工夫也就不易；最初以大豆浸入水中歷十數小時，夏日四五小時亦可，乃和水入磨，碾成細粉小漿，以布濾之得生漿豆渣，豆渣可充猪食，生漿入鑊，文火煑之，達三百餘度時漿巳熟，鑊面可得薄衣，曰豆腐衣，爲豆腐一類中之最補者，熟漿即豆乳，漿中入石膏，凝就爲水豆腐，即豆腐花，澆入布袋中榨以外力，可得豆腐乾，乾絲等品，其所含水量之多寡，則視所施榨力之大小而定，若捨石膏而且鹽滷使凝就，則澆出者爲豆腐，豆腐之澆製以嫩者爲佳，故壓力以八十公斤左右爲宜，逾之將變老，而不及則豆腐不結，惟其中時間上之久暫亦須注意：以上蓋豆腐製法之大略，至吃法則另有食譜，不必多言，再說到牠的性質，除上述功效外，在牠的表面，可得柔軟潔白之讚，其味則較之仇貨海味誠清高多矣，願同胞母忘此完全國貨，平民化的經濟滋補飲食品。</p>

<p>衣食住行，是人生的四大要素，而食居其第二位，可見其重要性之一斑了。現在有許多人，一談到食，總以爲吃大菜去，吃外國東西去，好像不吃外貨東西，是與自己的體面有關似的。這實在是一個錯誤的念頭，我们應該須把他糾正過來。　　我们是中國人，應當用中國貨，當然，吃也不能例外的，旣是中國人，就要吃國貨的食品，切不要有重外貨輕國產的念頭，要知道，帝國主義的侵華，是無微不至的，即以食品一項而論，每年要被他们刮去不少的錢呢，因此，我们應該速即的覺悟起來，大家在這國貨年的當兒，要服用國貨的習慣，養成起來，那才是一件迫切的事呢丨</p>
<p>至於國貨的食品在現在，眞是多極了，而且比以前也進步了不少了，和外國貨比較起來，巳有不相上下，並駕齊驅之勢。即以冠生園的食品，樣樣是國貨·月餅呀丨菓子露呀丨肉鉸呀……名目繁多，不勝枚舉，東西旣好，價錢又不貴，我们應當起來提倡。使國貨食品臻臻日上。</p>
<p>還有如泰康公司的餅乾等等，都是十足道地的國貨食品，爲大家所知道的，我们亦何樂而不吃國貨食品呢？</p>
<p>總之，在國貨年，應用中國貨，現在我们可以把這二句話，姑且改一下：（在國貨年，應吃中國貨）·讀者们，你们以爲對嗎丨</p>

<p>可是也正和國人的倡興一種新事業一模一樣的變成曇花一現而己丨這種新興園藝業的蓬勃的氣象，終於爲了交通不便，銷路壅塞，栽育不良，產品窳劣以及包裝，製造的不講究，而衰敗没落了。從前認作黄金樹的果樹，現在是伐下來當作燃料了，一畝畝果園依舊翻做作物田，曾幾何時，滄桑變幻，回首當年，不勝今昔之慨丨</p>
<p>園藝業是到末路了罷？可是成千累萬舶來的橙，橘，椰子，以及半製品，精製品如葡萄乾，果子露，果子醬之類，不又到處充塞在我们的市塲上麽？這决不是園藝的末路，而是園藝業者本身的没落哟丨</p>
<p>要挽救目前國產園藝没落的趨勢：當然這是不可忽視的丨我们唯有討尋病源，對症下藥，大約不外乎：一，改良栽育方法，一，從事分等與包裝，三，設法便利運輸，開拓市塲，四，設廠製造貯藏及提煉。</p>
<p>但是這又談何容易呢？没有宏厚的資本，没有相當的人才，是决不能辦到的，要適應目前的環境，我認爲唯有採用（合作）的方式是最相宜的了。</p>
<p>無疑我们要立地集合各個從事園藝業或於園藝業有興趣的同志，組織成（園藝產銷合作社）來，集中我们的資本和人才，以共同從事於園藝業的生產，運銷及製造的改進和發展，這樣許能挽救每年鉅萬漏巵的舶來果品於萬一罷一</p>

<p>— 傳敬嘉</p>
<p>提起火腿，大家都會想到金華。金華的火腿的確是很有名的。我很幸運的生產在出火腿的地方，至少，見了火腿不會像他鄉人一樣的當爲珍品。</p>
<p>火腿雖稱爲出產在金華，可是出產的地方，還要算東陽和義烏。在那兒，火腿是最大宗的出產品，每年運出的火腿眞不計其數！近年來，别的行當都要蝕本，只有火腿生意比較好，所以做火腿生意的人更多了！</p>
<p>雖然是一只小小的火腿，可是也該化上不少的時候和工夫力量，先把猪腿割下來，再用鹽醃起來。還要晒哩，洗哩，把腿上不好的油肉割下來哩，眞要化上不少的工夫的。</p>
<p>火腿的滋味眞是說不出的。就是那鮮紅的顔色也夠人垂涎的。</p>
<p>别的地方當然也有醃腿貨的，可是滋味總是金華火腿好一些，這並不是金華有什麽出火腿的風水，實在是金華那一方面的猪養得好。在那邊，養猪是爲農人最大的副產。一方面要靠猪的糞做肥料，一方面可以賺錢。他们養猪並不是隨便的，猪的食料簡直比人的食材還要好。大麥，豆，蕃薯葉等等都是平常的飼料，有許多人家在猪的食料中混合着糯米或其他人的食物。所以那邊的猪因了食料的不同，肉也有些兩樣，因此火腿的滋味更鮮美了。</p>

<p>吾人每到秋冬，亟思服食補品，蓋一年來事業勞形，身心不無虧損，自應有以調補，補品中所熟知者，如參，茸，燕窩，銀耳等類，但究含何種補質，有何功效，大多茫然，僅知人參之補氣，鹿茸别直參之性熱，燕窩之滋陰，對銀耳之功效，所知比較稍多，如治陰虧，體氣虚弱，肺病，咯血，久咳，胃炎，便秘，痔瘡，婦女血崩白帶，不消化等症，據上述各補品之功效，參茸燕窩至屬單純，效力微薄，且多偏頗，自以銀耳（即白木耳）一物功用最多，最適合吾人之服食。</p>
<p>銀耳功用雖如上述，但究屬父老相傳，朱足據以爲信，今科學昌明，自應實地化騐，知其成分所在，方能據爲準確。</p>
<p>本市四川商店，以專門經營四川銀耳蕃稱，該店前年曾以四川自置山塲所產之銀耳，特請中國科學社胡澤君，作科學上精確之化騐，化騐結果，銀耳内含多量之脂肪，蛋白質，　，　，鐵，鈉，等原素外，更有甚多類似亞拉伯樹膠之粘液汁，精於醫學者云：此項粘液汁有三大功效，（一）助消化（二）補血液（三）利大便（按歐戰時戰塲上流血過多之人醫生用百分之六之亞拉伯樹膠和千分之七食鹽加入蒸溜水主入血管以填補血液，有良好成績請參看中國科學社出版之（四川銀耳研究）一書）</p>
<p>世傳四川銀耳能治百病，久服益壽延年，今觀所含成分自非虚語，蓋食物中未有能同時具上述三種功用，而補品中更難覓得，今銀耳能全數具有，奇珍之稱，當之無愧。</p>
<p>查銀耳產地非只四川一處，貴州湖北兩省亦有出產，以地理氣候之不同，功效似不及四川所產之偉大，故售者均以四川銀耳名之。</p>

<p>現在市上國貨食品中最時髦者。莫過於月餅。祇須信足所之。隨處可見字大如拳之中秋月餅市招。高懸　際。臨風招展。而其光潔圓潤。形如滿月。與其甘美酥軟。滋味可口。亦皆使人聯想及之。月餅旣具有若斯之誘惑性。於是熙攘往來者。莫不大提小紥。爭相購備。而以一快朶頤爲樂焉。月餅旣爲一般人所熱烈歡迎。製售者爲適合需要起見。更精益求精。而月餅之銷路。亦因而愈盛。即就杏花酒樓一家而言。每屆中秋節邊所售者。其數達十餘萬。如合全市全國所售者計之。其數不更可驚耶。　　說者，謂月餅所以暢銷。實爲國人愛好和平心理之表現。蓋以月餅象徵團圓也。果爾。則當國人安啖月餅之餘。甚望其試一遥想東北三千萬同胞。亦能否如吾人之從容飽啖月餅耶。更一推想吾全國各處。果能人人圓滿。家家團聚。年年安坐而食此月餅耶。</p>

<p>— 純梅</p>
<p>趁此機會，正迎合我心理上所要發表的幾句話。</p>
<p>我國自和東西洋通商以來，正是東風漸來，歐俗逐至丨到現在，簡直比較交通便利的地方都有牠们的足跡丨倒將本國原有的一切，全都過剩擱置丨這點也是我们中華民族絶大的錯誤處，也就是將國貨退化的大原因。</p>
<p>現在指定飲食品來講，在每個人的心目中總認爲時髦或好奇而化去少數的金錢，其實那知大部分人都是害着這純一的怪病，將大批驚人的數目，填滿着幾千噸的海輪底空艙，載運到國外去給他们建設，便利的交通，新奇的貨物，精益求精底惡毒利器，再來賜與秋葉式國土的眼蠶身上，浸毒，沉醉……以致達到滅亡之路！</p>
<p>例如常吃的洋菜，東洋醃魚，和一切束餐西餐的食品，處處都大可不必享用！即使在某一方面須要共同和東西洋人共桌的時間，在國内講，更便當容易吃到新鮮的國菜，在某種事件的進行和情感上，我承認絶端不會發生阻擋。在國外講，好在究竟少數，但在可能範圍之内，我们還得咀嚼國菜，再講到國内的大人先生们，買辦階級们，洋行職員以及其他人等，請你们服過我這服（通靈劑）之後，把整個一切破產的中國底國民責任心發見出來，挽救，挽救你以後自身的安全罷！</p>

<h3 id="c323">給婦女讀的書 <a href="#c323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>近來，給兒童讀的書，是多極了：不管質的好壞，單是看看量，總可以說一句：（我们的兒童有福了）。</p>
<p>不過，我想到我们還少一類書：給婦女讀的。本來呢，婦女也是人，不必事事與男子（橋歸　，路歸路）的分開來。但因傳統的闗係，今日的婦女的脚步，多數還不能直接走獨木小　，非給另造一條路不可。事實具在，誰也不至否認的。然而，我们的文化界，似乎還不曾注意到這一層。她们不能過橋，便讓她们留在隔岸，這樣的自由放任政策，是必至妨害文化的發達的，廚川白村說得好：（在文化生活上的男子與婦女的闗係，匹如在二人三足的競技中似的，一方面不管是如何的能跑，他方面那個人若是不能跑，是到底不成事的）。</p>
<p>先前固然有過（新女性）（婦女雜誌）等期刋以及（婦女問題研究會）的叢書，可是都係選定了闗於婦女的問題而作學理的研究的，這類書物對於婦女的影響如何，　難知道，但就我所見，好像這類書物的讀者，倒是男子較多，影響也是男子方面較大。現在這且不去說他，我只要說對於女子，於道類書物之外，還需一種以特殊的作風，提供一般的知識，務　略受敎育的婦女们終卷忘倦，這樣的漸漸提高她们的見　，培養她们的對於事物的理解和判斷力。</p>
<p>如同對於兒童一樣，對於婦女，我以爲也是需要一種特殊的作風的。</p>
<p>至若對於一般的摩登小姐，則仍以供給多角的戀愛小說爲是。據說法國的香水大王柯蒂（Ｆraneisooty）之由一香水行商起家，全靠摸熟了婦女心理的三大原則：一，香水名稱須好聽；二，瓶子要精美；三，價錢要昻貴。我们的出版家，根可以襲用這三個原則；一，書名須好聽；二，封面要精美；三，價錢要！！不，這一條却須修改：價錢要便宜。因爲我们的摩登小姐的錢，是要留着買昻貴的香水的。</p>
<p>在呌做　戲的這刋物上，看到這樣的話：以和善的微笑的臉），以及種種適合有閒階級女性的條件而獲得許多太太小姐的愛慕的明星金焰，此後應該繼母性之光）之後，變換角色，給太太小姐们以有意義的引導，帶她们上光明之路。太太小姐们是有些偶像觀念的，她们不會因金熖的變換角色而離開他，因此他也不必故意放棄她们。</p>
<p>這也是一種舊瓶子裝新醋的辦法，我们的戀愛小說家，曾經試過的，可是成功似乎遠不及（母性之光）那麽大。這是有别的原因的，我以爲與方法的本質無闗。（春蠶）的作者，在某種意味上，也是這方法的利用者，不過，這作者的影響，多半還在男子方面。對於婦女，還需另一種作家。這一節是單就文藝方面說。</p>
<h3 id="c324">街的素描 <a href="#c324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍</p>
<p>星期六的下午ＸＸ街照例是擠得和容着許多魚的小魚池似的，人们歪歪斜斜地穿過，有的在店門口瞧着瞧着便停留下來，有的又像衝錄似的往前走着，跌跌撞撞地。</p>
<p>爲着是才開學，街上觸目都是學生，男學生的淺色外套褂或翻領襯衫，年青而又輕快的脚步夾着談笑；女學生的白衫短裙在西風裏瀟洒地飄着，有的襟上掛着三角徽章，車夫凑上去：</p>
<p>（要車，盤門？）猜中了便張着嘴笑。書舖子裏，女學生尖着嗓子問幾折，揀着一些精美的新式的文具；也總忘不了到洋貨店去買些蝶霜或是西蒙蜜。年輕的心總都是愛美的，雖然間或也問一下：（這胰子盒不是日本貨？）</p>
<p>（天津良鄉）和（各種月餅上市）的廣告吸去不少的人，伸着手耐心地等着。乞兒们追在男的後面喊：（大少爺，修福修壽，將來出洋，做官……）在女的背後便是：（行好事吧，小姐，將來嫁個有錢有勢的主席，軍長……）失望的便掉轉身嘟噥着：（阿要氣數丨）</p>
<p>崗警立在十字路口，舞着指揮棍，有時敲着車蓬，心氣不順時便扯過個把車墊往崗亭中梛去，車夫現着乞憐而又憤惱的眼，在警棍溜到背脊上之前便飛跑開去，車輪在石子街上顛躓得發響。</p>
<p>但没有電車汽車的城市總是靜悄的，包車的脚鈴和喇叭聲被混雜的人聲蓋住，成了那麽糢糊一片的吵嚷；驚心的剌激是没有的，無綫電放出來的聲音也夠平凡，大半是說書或（寶寶要睡覺）一類的歌。</p>
<p>一批人向街頭巷尾消失了，另一批人又從街頭巷尾湧了上來。初秋的凉風吹送着女人的香氣，大家都感着微醉而又爽快的心情。</p>
<h3 id="c325">秋 <a href="#c325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— 每</p>
<p>午夜夢回，雨聲單調地在淅瀝着，風在屋角嗚嗚地呌喚，（秋又來了，）我陡然地記起。</p>
<p>玻璃窗子是這樣地在顫抖着，燈，黯然地只自沉默着，一個三角形的小房間中，蕩漾着新秋之夜的凄凉味。我躺着，躺得骨頭到處都覺得酸痛，這是僂麻質斯患者在陰雨夜的慣態，在我是並不介意的。我兀自睜大了朦朧的倦眼望着四周，四周都是這樣的死寂！身上蓋着單薄的毯子，微覺嫩寒侵膚，我才肯定地想：「秋確已到了人間」，而且我知道這便是蕭瑟的秋之夜了。</p>
<p>時間眞是利箭一樣地飛快，我記得在一個悶熱異常的暑天的晚上，坐在俄國小劇塲看完了友人们演出的戲，深夜，鍍出了劇場，便到泊在十六舖碼頭的一隻輪船上去，那正是一個月照波明，海風吹暑的夏之夜，别了久住的上海，别了一切親愛的朋友，投向七年未見的故鄉的懷抱裹去。</p>
<p>那時候的心中，藴藏着幻想的歡欣和現實的悲苦，正是所謂苦樂參半的情景。一邊總是捨不得上海和在上海的朋友们，一邊却在憧　着故鄉的一切，在歸途中的心情，眞是說不出的矛盾，忐忑着，忐忑着，一直抵了家。</p>
<p>自然，七年的闊别，不能說故鄉的恣態毫無變換，至少，多了一座中山公園和一個鐘樓總是事實，雖說公園是改造的而且並不好：鐘樓上的鐘也並不準確。這便是革命後，闔縣人民費了不少金錢而獲得的所謂「建設」的成績，據故鄉的人们說。</p>
<p>滿想乘這暑假的閒暇，盡情地逛一回，在歸途中早巳計劃着將要去逛各處的名勝，誰知終於没有實現，因爲病又來糾纒着我，差不多每天躺着不動彈，除了間或到田間去看農夫们割稻，車水之外，便無所事事了。鄉居生活的冲淡味倒着實嘗到，這時常使我回憶到童年，因而忽然回復到原有的生活。</p>
<p>料不到，一個長長的暑假，竟在病和無聊之中無聲無息地度過，好像時間是特别地短促，一刹那之間，便又跌入秋去：同時，我也復别了親愛的家人和朋友，坐着曾拖我回家的船，悄然地隨着無情的海水漂浮到别末久的上海了，爲的是别來未久，上海和我倒並没有一些兒生疎。</p>
<p>路上滿是秋季大减價的店招，女人们也都巳換上了單薄的秋服，整個　市溜出了秋的氣息，「秋來了」這是千　　　，决不會騙人的。</p>
<p>眞的丨現在巳是夏去秋來的當兒，人的心情也一樣地由悶熱而至於陰鬱了！有了這陰鬱的心情，偏又碰着這無情的風雨做出了幾許的陰鬱，流浪在異鄉的人，委實不知道怎樣才舒適？這一顆小小的心，終於被陰鬱握住了，握得緊緊的。</p>
<p>秋！别再陰鬱下去罷，明天就晴朗起來多好啊！我這樣低低地祈禱着！</p>
<p>然而，雨還依然在窗外浙瀝地下着，風依然嗚嗚地在呌喚，依然，我也担心着明天的陰鬱！</p>
<h3 id="c326">整書記 <a href="#c326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>來句開塲白，雨後秋凉，好一個讀書天氣。</p>
<p>這回搬了家，籠子似的房間，放不了多少書，可是零零亂亂的郤竟有四箱，少不得親自整理一番。</p>
<p>書是中西參半，從詩歌，散文，小說聖經，左傳，春秋，以及許多拖著　ism</p>
<p>尾巴的，到玉歷鈔本，觀音寶卷，命相全書，寫信不求人等，都已粗備一二。讓這些聖人學者，走江湖騙飯吃的，大家聚在一處，昕夕相共，眞是一件使我高興的事。</p>
<p>我便著手整理。</p>
<p>這些書各就自己立塲，大聲的呌著訴說著，拿出自己的看家本領，以博我信任。孔老二提倡王道，子路鼓吹武力，但丁低唱神曲，莎士比亞大做其三本鐵公鷄，無常鬼白天捉人，觀音菩薩普渡衆生，算命先生摇酸五只指頭，算來算去，倒底還是個好命，與事實不符；後　　　　　　　　　　木水火上　　行缺金　　　星高照　斷送十年　　運　爲之嗚呼不置！</p>
<p>這一來，算命先生卻首當其衝了。因爲我發覺他的技術，實在太不高明。就此打定主意，把命相全書和天演論放在一起，好讓他受些洋奴敎育，　幾個ＡＢＣＤ，乘間洋化一下。</p>
<p>不料孔老二郤不服氣，大放厥辭，認爲這是（用夷變夏），非賣國賊决不喪心病狂至此！這一句話，直氣得我把老二鬍子根根摘下，一毛不留。過後瞪睛細看，原來郤已變成小白臉。活該，誰敎你道學得這麽利害！</p>
<p>正當這個時候，朋友Ｘ來訪。Ｘ者，某敎會大學畢業生也。他進來以後，細细一看，忙把聖經藏在身後，卻指著觀音寶卷對我說；（二十世紀，你還這般迷信，豈不令人笑斷肚腸上）我被說得面紅耳赤，恍然大悟，把觀音菩薩痛叱一番，她只得披髮跣足，掩面痛哭，大踏步奔向火燄山而去。</p>
<p>我乃連連稱道我友Ｘ的功績，Ｘ得意忘形，碰痛了莎士比亞的膝蓋，莎翁大怒，使展出做戲劇時弄假刀假槍的本領，剌斜裏就是一刀，不料戳在Ｘ的尊股上，拍的一聲，聖經落地，（我的朋友）四脚朝天，整好了的書全給帶翻，半天工夫郤白費了。</p>
<p>也罷！且等過幾天再整。</p>
<h3 id="c327">剌激 <a href="#c327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>— 謝冰</p>
<p>只要有一個人，我想他一定有尋找剌激的時候丨至少在他的一生總有一兩次的。垢和浩走了以後，我忽然感到寂寞起來，整天不想說一句話，不想見一個人，只願意孤零零地獨來獨往，獨吃獨唱，不過，太奇怪了，她们在這里的時候，我又覺得太不自由，太麻煩，甚至隨便出去一下，她们也要問；</p>
<p>（冰，你去幹嗎？）</p>
<p>至於喝開水，吃糖，吃花生米更不要說了，總是先給我吃的。有一天我要寫信，她们也要寫日記，而小小的桌子却又堆了些東西，爲了不好寫，我有點恨她们；丨丨走吧，你们走了就好了。</p>
<p>可是這種念頭我只有一刹那，立刻我發現了自己的錯誤。</p>
<p>丨丨她们好容易才來到此地，而你又費了半個多月的功夫去迎接她们，爲什麽爲着一點芝蔴大的事就炒起來了呢？</p>
<p>於是趁着垢問我（好不好寫？）的當兒，我連忙堆着滿臉的笑容回答她；</p>
<p>（好寫，好冩！）</p>
<p>還有，晚上是我最討厭的時候。</p>
<p>小小的房子裏擺着一張幾塊木板搭成的床和一張小桌子，已經擠得三個人不能翻身了，而還要加放一張行軍床，更是到了水洩不通的地步，行軍床是如此的笨重而難以處置，有時三個人都弄不好，浩和我的手常常被鐵釘弄出血來，因此我有一次也恨起她们來：</p>
<p>丨丨走吧，你们走了就好了</p>
<p>可是，可怕的日子終於來到，她们眞的走了！</p>
<p>在她们準備走的前一天，我雖然在忙着寫幾封信託她们帶到上海去，但我的心裹很平靜，好像她们並不會走似的。有否轎夫的電話没有來，我想一定没有希望了。</p>
<p>丨丨她们是走不成功的，我不過打個電話呌轎夫，騙騙她们而已。</p>
<p>我驕傲而且堅决地相信。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c328">（非戰）與（備戰）　健 <a href="#c328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>近來有　　　端　　的消息，同時在同一家報上披露着：一個是世界非戰大會正在　地閉會：另一個就是列强也正在鈎心鬭角，謁力備戰。</p>
<p>戰大會的代表，到處遭近着的是（扣留），（禁止登岸）。開會地點，（某租　當道一巴　　　：一國民政府態度），（猶在未定之天）；（現將請求公共租界當局准其在界内開會），能否爲了馬萊動爵個人的國籍和面子闗係，得到一個（准）字，怕也（就在未定之天）吧？</p>
<p>回轉　來　看備戰各國，那就熱鬧非凡，形勢緊張：美國要完成軍艦計畫，意大利　空隊訪美，法國航空隊飛往　聯，英國趕築新加坡軍港，加製戰鬭　，　國　社　，更向鄰國邊界，劍拔弩張，横衝直撞。此外，大發戰爭狂的日本，　　軍費，擴充實力，演習防空，海軍大操，尤其耀武揚威，不可一世。甚至政體不同的蘇聯，也在整軍經武，大忙特忙：小國如比利時也急於在邊境建築鞏固的防禦工程，惴惴自危。</p>
<p>非戰方面，幾乎地球雖大，欲求開會一席地都不可得：備戰方面，聲勢浩大，氣　　丈。這　個防力，雖是壁壘森嚴，陣容相對，表面上比較其實力，（非戰）對於（備戰），恰似累卵投石，　臂當車，一弱一强，判若霄壞。</p>
<p>現在的全副武裝，是操在資產階級的手裹，那是一定的。因爲製造或購辦軍火，是（非錢不行），何况保護資產，才用得到戰具呢。放槍開砲的士兵们，不過求自身最低限度的生活費，供人犠牲罷了。</p>
<p>戰爭也可以說是國家的（刦奪行爲），在戰神的背後還站着個財神丨經濟，而且前者是要服服帖帖　從後者的指揮的。近代各國的經濟衝突，日形尖銳化，快要從經濟戰一變而爲槍砲戰了。換句話話：近世的戰爭就是佔據殖民地，攫獲市塲來吸收原料，推銷熟貨，就是這麽一回事。（自然，這里所指的是各帝國主義間的直接戰爭，各弱國間接受帝國主義的騙使，自相火併，如最近古巴……又當别論。</p>
<p>因此，戰爭是爲　數製造軍火或販賣軍火或其他實業大家等等的資本家造機會，發横財：勞苦階級，只有失業，流離，死亡……算是受着戰爭的恩賜，不管是戰勝國或是戰敗國。這事在歐戰中很可以證明的。</p>
<p>講到戰爭的本體，是的確可怕的，也最殘酷的。（兵連禍結），（兵凶戰危），無論古今中外，莫不深票痛絶，一致反對，只則有少數别具心腸的纔會主戰。可是不中用：反對任你反對，戰爭還是戰爭。而　科學發達，戰爭器械益加精明，殺人之多，破壞力之强，仕百千萬倍於往昔。這是什麽原因呢？照孫中山先生說：世界人口總數算有十五萬萬，倒有十二萬萬五千萬人是被壓迫，祗有二萬萬五千萬人是壓者。壓迫者當然是有槍階級丨軍警受他们的豢養，聽他们的指揮：對面的被壓迫者，旣無資產，自然也是無槍階級了。差不多四分之三的無槍階級，要反對四分之一的有槍階級，失敗那是和白日底下一樣的明白了；然而，用這麽多數人的心理，去攻擊那少數人的心理，假使（思想就是力量）是眞理，那末，多數會得到最後的勝利，也是千眞萬確的；並且，看來這種時機，或許就在最近的將來。</p>
<p>倘若我们要做現時代的人，稍具一些常識，那是誰都應當站在（非戰）一邊的；不過也不能用籠統的思想來糊塗地做應聲蟲。雖然戰爭是不好，也得辨别其性質：例如美國求獨立而與英國戰和要求釋放黑奴而釀成南北之戰，以及法國巴黎公社的革命，蘇聯十月革命之類，都於人類史上有莫大的價值，我们也忍痛表示同情。</p>
<p>所以我们的主張：在消極方面，反對各國備戰，反對爲少數資產階級的利益去戰爭，反對循環式以暴易暴的戰爭；在積極方面，贊成人人備戰，贊成聯合全世界被壓迫的十二萬萬五千萬人起來向着二萬萬五千萬的壓迫者而備戰。</p>

<p>這一天，一切和平時一樣。没有颶風，没有大雨。勞働階級已起來工作，布爾喬亞在被窩中尋好夢。太陽從東方探起頭來，照進了王少奶奶的臥房。臥床上已不見了她的惺忪睡態，就是王少爺，也早已執着報紙在翻本埠新聞了。顯然這一天，和平時不同；至少王公館裹有什麽事情發生，把這一對年青夫婦從香夢中摧醒來。</p>
<p>櫉房内同時也起雜亂的聲音，王少奶奶穿着睡衣穿梭似的從樓上到樓下，她要照顧王少爺起身時的一切，她要吩咐櫉房中的事物。整個王公館粉亂着，惟有兩房烏黑的大門緊閉着没有動靜。　　王少爺鄱完了一份報，被少奶奶殷勤的催促，伸了雙手臂，坐起身來，一枝香烟就送上他的嘴唇，他呼了一口烟，像不知事的小孩子一樣說：（這一點事，也值得這樣忙嗎？）</p>
<p>（自己生日，躺着不起來，我忙錯了？）王少奶奶蘋菓樣的臉，無論怎麽的大氣，一會時自己笑出聲來。</p>
<p>於是我们知道，今天是王少爺的生　。</p>
<p>堂中掛着一幅百壽圖·一對金字寫着的紅燭，插在雪亮的三字旗上是那樣的威武，熱氣騰騰的三生，引起一個小乞兒在門外不肯離開。</p>
<p>王少爺的親戚，朋友，王少奶奶的親戚，朋友，一個個赴時裝展覽會似的穿得十分漂亮，我们的少奶奶再不是穿梭時候的裝束了，換上一襲新裁喬其絨旗袍，她的臉上當然是永遠笑着，迎接每一個來賓，授紙烟，掏瓜子，酬酢於許多來賓之問，那樣自然，那樣瀟灑。　　贊美稱賀。我们知道今天是王少爺二十八歳的小生日。</p>
<p>王公館裏今天的熱鬧情形，是由夫婦兩個相對午餐，變了五桌酒菜，男僕女僕來往的搬着菜，主人殷勤的勸酒，賓客自然是開懷暢飲了。</p>
<p>今天午後，也不像平時夫婦兩個趕電影院去賸着僕人打瞌盹。樓上樓下乒乓乒乓打着三桌麻將，餘多的人團着作壁上觀。每打牌的人嗑着瓜子，呼着香烟，和背後的人閒談，講着前天和出一付三番，赢了許多錢，或者一付大牌打錯了之後，被對家和去等話，但是他们黄經是留意着每一隻打出來的牌，白板碰，十四，二十八，二十四，四十八。和約人笑，不和的人也笑，旁觀的人當然美，因爲今天是王少爺二十八歳的大生日。</p>
<p>王少爺同着幾位喜歡香一筒的朋友，窩在亭子間中，床上躺着，台上坐着，燒着烏烟，談着福致里，怡紅院的老七老八。談起女人總是眉飛眼舞的，裹面的笑聲和外面的牌聲相和，今天的特别情形使管弄堂巡捕也莫明其妙的問着泡水回來的娘姨說：（府上有什麽喜事？）</p>
<p>（我们少爺生日。）娘姨笑着回答，不像平時駡殺千刀。</p>
<p>吃壽麵，又是一陣忙碌。</p>
<p>夜飯特别比平時遲幾小時，原來還是王少奶奶瞧見自己手腕上的手表已是十句鐘而想起開夜飯的。打麻將的，旁觀的，在亭子間裏講女人的，時間在於他们是不值得寶貴的，而况是王少爺二十八歳的小生日呢。</p>
<p>雖然整整的一天在吃飯後是過去了，但是不妨借用明天上午的時光，時光並也不和他们計較的。這一天，一切和平時一樣，没有颶風，没有大雨，不過在兩扇烏黑大門内的王公館是過着不平凡的一天。</p>
<p>一位年輕夫婦，送走了賓客，感到微微倦意，上床時正在天色將明的時候。</p>
<p>第二天照例是來了，太陽從東方探起頭來照進王少奶奶的臥房，這裹是靜悄悄地睡着一個人　一切是還和平時一樣。</p>
<h3 id="c331">（賑災募捐）心 <a href="#c331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>秋雨霽後的黄昏，是個怪有趣的時份：草塲上泥沙濘濕，樹葉上還滴着一點點的小水珠；密佈的烏雲，叢壘的白霚，被新開放的嬌艶的夕陽排棄得没有立足的餘地了，低氣壓變成了高氣壓。人们都感覺到輕鬆的舒暢的適意，於是我们幾人拿了椅子到草塲上去，欣賞這慰快的時份。</p>
<p>忽然跑進來了一夥穿短衣的黄臉青年漢子，手裹拿着筆硯和一本黄紙釘成和簿册以的東西，薄面上歪斜地寫着（賑災募捐）四個大字。操着北腔的上海話，像戲台上大花臉說白似的有聲有色地說：</p>
<p>（先生：今天我们來？要向貴校募些賑災　，在過去漢口一帶大水高至幾丈，傷害人民房屋的事情，想必先生们是知道的。近來黄河决口了，那裏的人民，當然又是受了災害，他们都是我们的同胞，大家是應該互相救濟的，所以</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>我们幾個人就乘一些空閒時間自動的出來募些捐去救濟他们，懇求先生们慷慨施與一些。』</p>
<p>『啊！諸位是熱心的善士，來爲可憐的災民募賑乞援，這是再功德合理不過的事情，可是我们自己也正在等待人家的捐助和救濟呀！』我们只是這樣不置可否的敷衍他们，態度半似開玩笑的　　『是的，先生，自從九一八·一二八後，各處市面都凋落了，就是敎育界當然也是受到同樣的影響呀！這點，本來我们是深知的，不過我们想到現在之受災難過非人的地獄生活的都是我们自己的同胞呀！我们眞不忍眼巴巴的去讓他们活受罪，我们爲了這點人應有的惻隠之心，所以才來不辭奔勞的幹這件事情。請先生们不要儘說客氣話，大家都是自家人，互相帮帮忙是應該的。我们總比他们幸運些，水還没有從脚下漲上來：肚子裏還没有唱着『空城計』，所以懇求先生们慷慨解囊隨意樂助些吧，這是修于修孫功德無量的事呀！』討厭的東西们曉曉不休的數說着。</p>
<p>『那末，我想還是這樣吧！靠我们幾個人的錢，是不會有多少的，明天我代你们向我们的朋友處及本校學生家長去募捐些，請你们留一個地址，，以後我寫信通知你们來領吧！』老張機警的抓住了他们的弱點。</p>
<p>他们的臉色變了，他们的臉上顯出勉强的苦笑來，似乎在表現出他们的詭計不能成售。「我们窮人有什麽地址」他们自言自語地邊說邊足了。</p>
<p>我在旁邊靜靜的聽着，最後看見他们怪樣態度的表現，我心裏起了很大的感慨！「黄河决口」，是旣成事實，「災民遇着非人的地獄生活」，亦同樣是像鐵一般的旣成事實！黄河爲甚麽會决口？災民應當賑濟不？爲甚麽今天竟會有借「賑災募捐」嘴上說得比蜜還甜的菩薩心腸的幌子而實行其狼心狗肺冒名歛錢的勾當呢？……這，這些是誰的責任呢？黄河决口了，這個社會亦將成熟了「黄河」同樣的命運，而激劇地在演變着了！這，關於這一點，誰還有能來粉飾和否認呢？</p>

<p>行人如織的日昇樓，那巨大的　管嘖着烟，兩條壯健的手臂，捧着一下可以致死一條人命的鐵鏟，在炙手的黑沙中，屠殺這秋的禮物，每包十二枚，那怪香，性甜的良鄉栗子。圍着的一堆人，一面咀嚼着，一面再能領略從無線電中播出來的尖俏的姑娘唱着謝謝毛毛雨。</p>
<p>剥着栗子沿南京路走，在許多大减價的旗幟中，再能給你感到秋却是來了機會，月餅大會，知道嗎？舉首望明月，低頭思故鄉的中秋近在目前。月餅大會，唐明皇游月宫的模型在霓虹燈照耀着的玻璃窗内牽動着他的手。不必我故意聲明，像栗子攤前一樣，圍着的是人，不知他们注意着唐明皇游月宫的玩意兒，還是垂涎着那個像塔一般的大月餅？</p>
<p>上海是一年四季變化着，不過生活在上海環境中的人没有感覺到罷了！譬如說：栗子大王與月餅大會，上海人祗知道這是兩件現在的應時品，他们不知道這是蕭煞的秋天，大雪紛紛的冬巳緊跟在後面。</p>

<p>現在我應該說到秋天的女人，秋天的女人與夏天的女人没有分别，薄薄的衣，踝腿，不過跑游泳池再没有這個勇氣了。當然，女人也知道現在比過去凉，然而爲了未來，這時候須要提早訓練，免臨渴而掘井買疼瘡膏。男子们倒底不上勁，你瞧厚厚的灰條法蘭紱巳掛在身上，像櫉窗中的廣告人，那些　脚的藝術學生，也把一套僅有的常青嗶嘰搬到身上，如其你比較吊在手彎上的你的甜心，眞要愧煞哩！</p>

<p>二二六六二二怎我没有碰到，有時候我也這樣想過。第二期也像現在的玩意兒一樣，每條一元，總得戒一個月香烟去買這末一條，五萬元這驚人的數目，常把我從夢中驚醒；不過至今挪不出一塊錢來碰碰自己的額角頭丨</p>

<p>Pang Bingxun Plans to Resign as Commander of Chahar Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gaoliying Telegram: This morning, Fang's troops who had infiltrated Huairou County surrounded the county seat, cutting off communication. The director of the Gaoliying Public Security Bureau received a report in the afternoon that pedestrians could only reach Fengkoushan, three miles from the city, where Fang's cavalry was stationed, prohibiting pedestrians from passing. Fang's troops have not moved south, and the situation inside the city is unclear. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fang Ji fled into Rehe Province, he took up a puppet post. According to a certain military strategist, the purpose of a certain party in accepting Fang Ji's two units this time is purely to cover the defense of the puppet Rehe Province. Due to their limited strength, Fang Ji's two units cannot take any action for the time being. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the severe banditry situation in Chahar Province and the difficulty in suppressing it, Pang Bingxun intends to resign his post as Commander of Bandit Suppression in Chahar Province to the authorities. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Ji's two units, previously fleeing east from Dushikou, gathered in the Fengning County area on the border of Rehe, along with remnants of Zheng Guilin's troops, numbering approximately over five thousand. Yesterday, they entered Hebei Province through Changyuan Pass, north of Huairou. Changyuan Pass is a necessary route between Huairou and Fengning. This morning, a company of cavalry, about a hundred strong, from the vanguard of Fang's troops suddenly arrived at Huairou County, surrounding the city. County Magistrate Xu Wenquan failed to escape. Communication between Beiping and Miyun was completely cut off this afternoon. Tang and Ji's troops are also active near Changyuan Pass, conducting strict checks on pedestrians. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping Military Branch Discusses Two Important Cases</p>
<h3 id="e4">Organizational Outline of the Managerial Supervisory Committee, Plan for Streamlining Various Agencies of the Military Branch <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch held a regular meeting this morning, attended by committee members Song Zheyuan, Wan Fulin, Qin Dechun, Wang Shuchang, Rong Zhen, Xiao Zhenying, Shang Zhen, Pang Bingxun, Men Zhizhong, and more than ten others. Chairman He Yingqin proposed seventeen motions. Due to time constraints, only two motions were discussed: (1) The Organizational Outline of the Managerial Supervisory Committee, which had been drafted by Wei Yisan and others. The original plan was for 22 committee members, with the heads of the logistics departments of independent army divisions and armies that receive salaries and equipment as ex officio members. After being put forward for discussion, it was generally believed that the establishment of the committee must function as a supervisory and auditing body. If the heads of the logistics departments of each army were committee members, it would be difficult to convene meetings and inconvenient. Therefore, fixed committee members should be selected to be responsible for handling affairs. After detailed discussion, it was decided to entrust Wei Yisan, Hu Yukun, Rong Zhen, Xiao Zhenying, Shang Zhen, and more than ten others to review and revise it. (2) The expenses of the Military Branch itself and its affiliated agencies are excessive each month and should be streamlined urgently. The total expenses of the Military Branch amount to more than 500,000 yuan per month. The salaries of the Military Branch itself amount to more than 70,000 yuan per month, office expenses are more than 10,000 yuan, and the salaries of reserve personnel assigned to various army divisions amount to more than 90,000 yuan. After discussion, it was resolved to abolish the Shanghai Office and the radio station. The funding issues of affiliated agencies such as the press censorship bureau were all submitted for review. The above two cases, and the remaining fifteen cases, will be continued to be discussed and passed at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM. After the meeting, He invited Song to another room to discuss the aftermath of the Chahar situation. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Military Reduction Amidst International Conflicts: A Reality <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Britain and France have recently been engaged in discussions on the issue of military reduction. According to reports from Paris, the Anglo-French talks are progressing very well. At the same time, the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, and the U.S. representative, Davis, also traveled together to Paris, suggesting that the Disarmament Conference, which had been dormant for a long time, has a new glimmer of hope. However, the naval issue was not mentioned in the Anglo-French talks. Even if Britain and France can reach a considerable understanding, it may not be of much help to the future of disarmament. Although Britain and France do not have absolutely irreconcilable conflicts of interest in the arms race, both have not forgotten their ambition to dominate Europe. Furthermore, due to environmental factors, the temporarily accepted opinions may change. Therefore, the claim that the talks are progressing very well should not be taken as optimistic.</p>
<p>The reason why European disputes are becoming increasingly intense is that ethnic minority disputes are indeed one of the main causes. However, the antagonism between France and Germany is the most important root cause since the European War. Military reduction is the prelude to international cooperation and the foundation for world peace. However, in order to prevent the resurgence of German militarism, France has been striving to advocate for "security guarantees." In other words, it will not reduce its existing military strength without a solid guarantee. In addition, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries all follow France's lead. Therefore, France cannot but prepare a strong army in order to permanently control Europe. However, on the German side, the Hitler Party has incited German sentiment by striving to abolish the Treaty of Versailles and has seized power. Its demand for military equality is even more urgent, and its attitude towards expanding military strength is becoming increasingly resolute. If France refuses to revise the Treaty of Versailles and refuses to budge on the issue of military strength, then Germany will follow in Japan's footsteps and withdraw from the League of Nations, which is also within expectations. Furthermore, the attitude of Austria and Hungary is not only attracting the world's attention but is also a field for France and Italy to contend for. The attitudes of the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, and Romania are all closely related to this. The disputes of just these few entities are already very complicated and impossible to resolve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of the United States and Japan, the Washington Treaty will expire in 1936 in the blink of an eye. Japan is vigorously expanding its naval military budget and openly adding eight aviation squadrons. Recently, it has also built a huge airfield on the Ogasawara Islands. Its intentions are nothing more than two-fold: First, in terms of offense, if the United States wants to develop the Far Eastern market and gain a foothold in East Asia, it is incompatible with Japan's Monroe Doctrine in Asia. Japan will seize the opportunity to overturn the United States' power in the East, and even seize the Philippines and Guam, and further seize Hawaii, in order to look south to Australia and extend its iron hand to South America, which is not unexpected. Second, in terms of defense, Japan has gained power in Northeast China and wants to gradually consolidate its position so that the East can be entirely under its control. It must maintain its naval superiority. In addition, with the recent development of air forces, Japan must have a strong air force to protect its transportation in the western Pacific and the security of the Japanese mainland. Therefore, it is based on the Ogasawara Islands to resist the westward advance of the U.S. Air Force, which is also the fundamental intention of dominating East Asia.</p>
<p>Britain has deeply rooted economic power in the East and Hong Kong as its naval vanguard. However, compared with the overwhelming air power of the United States and the excellent submarines of Japan, it is the weakest leg of the three-legged stool. However, the British are also exceptionally clear about their interests. How can they sit idly by and watch Japan seize their Far Eastern interests? Therefore, they started with an economic alliance within the British Empire to use tariffs to restrain Japan, followed by naval shipbuilding competition in the hope of trapping Japan in poverty. As a result, Japan is becoming more actively preparing for war. In summary, the situation of international opposition is such, is there still room for discussing military reduction?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that the general situation in the world is perilous and has reached the point of no return. Storm clouds are gathering over the Pacific Ocean, showing everywhere that war is imminent. How can we survive in this urgent environment?</p>
<h3 id="e14">U.S. Resists Dumping of Japanese Goods: Import Taxes Increased on Japanese Light Bulbs and Rubber-Soled Shoes <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. Treasury Department, based on the order of the U.S. President, ordered by Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson to immediately increase import taxes on light bulbs and rubber-soled shoes to the extent that is sufficient to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods. (19th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the United States implemented the order to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods, it dealt a fatal blow to Japanese merchants engaged in the transportation of electric bulbs. The U.S. tariff on electric bulbs was originally 20%. Due to the sharp decline in the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, they took the opportunity to dump Japanese electric bulbs. Last year, they reached 4.5 million yuan. U.S. merchants suffered a great blow. As a result of the movement, the order to prevent dumping was implemented. As for Japanese rubber boots and shoes (rubber shoes), the total amount of exports in the first half of this year was approximately 17 million yen, of which rubber shoes exclusively sold to the United States accounted for 8.07 million yen, and canvas shoes accounted for only 341,000 yuan. Although losses in the U.S. market are inevitable, from the perspective of the total amount of these boots and shoes, the impact is still minimal. However, the future is still uncertain.

<p>Adverse Effects on Japan's Diplomacy and Trade; Japanese Foreign Ministry Seriously Considering Countermeasures</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry unofficially issued a statement saying that U.S. recognition of Russia is only a matter of time. If the United States does recognize Russia, Japan will suffer considerable losses. The impacts on Japan are: (1) After the United States recognizes Russia, it will promote the early success of Russia's Five-Year Plan, and Russia's political position in the Far East will be more stable. (2) Although the purpose of the United States approaching Russia is economic and commercial, the result will promote the United States and Russia to unite against Japan, which will cause many obstacles to Japan's policy toward China. (3) After the United States and Russia approach each other, the United States will buy more Russian goods and reject Japanese goods, which will have a major impact on the Japanese industrial community. (4) Negotiations with Russia will become more difficult. (20th China United Press Dispatch) (Tokyo) It is rumored that the United States is about to recognize the Soviet Union, centering on the issue of long-term allowance of credit from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is seeking careful countermeasures. (20th Denttsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>But Secretary of State Hull Denies</p>
<p>(Washington) According to several sources, the United States is preparing to consider joining the League of Nations, and it is said that the United States will attach a condition, namely, that the United States will not be responsible for Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, which concerns maintaining the territorial integrity of member states, and Article 19, which stipulates sanctions against aggressor countries. Secretary of State Hull has denied this news, saying, "This statement contains an effect and is inconsistent with the facts. The United States government has no intention of changing the current relationship between the country and the League of Nations." (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Foreign news said that U.S. President Roosevelt will soon send a diplomatic representative to the League of Nations, but League of Nations executives have made various reservations about this news.

<h3 id="e17">International Supervision of Armaments Issue: Anglo-American Gentlemen's Agreement Established, Davis Asks France to Endorse <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, informed sources in British official circles told reporters that Britain and the United States have reached a gentlemen's agreement on the issue of international supervision of armaments. They are now working to ensure that the French proposal can be coordinated with the agreement reached by the two countries. As for the content of the agreement, it is expected that it will not be released before the negotiations with France have yielded results.</p>
<p>(Paris) U.S. Ambassador Davis began discussing the preparations for reopening the Disarmament Conference with key French government officials today. It is expected that Davis will inform France of the Anglo-American gentlemen's agreement and ask for its assistance so that the French proposal for supervising armaments can be coordinated with what has been agreed upon by Britain and the United States.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon recently cut short his vacation with the British Emperor in Balmoral due to a special cabinet meeting and rushed back to Beijing, which proves the importance of the meeting. Today, all newspapers stated that while Undersecretary of State Eden was discussing with the French authorities in Paris, he had now understood the vague points in the French proposal and would report truthfully to the cabinet. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Morning Post, informed circles in London feel that France's recent proposals have increased hopes for a compromise. It is also reported that if Britain and Italy do not support France, France intends to deal alone with Germany's violation of the demilitarized Rhineland, which has now been denied by semi-official circles. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Undersecretary of State Eden went to France to negotiate on the disarmament issue and then hastily returned to England, and the attitude of those in charge is also quite different. Some say that these two layers show that the situation has changed in ways that were not expected. Generally, people did not pay so much attention to Eden's mission beforehand. Although the authorities kept mum on the matter, some said that Eden believed that important progress had been made on the disarmament issue, that is, France's attitude towards the arms control system had been predetermined, and that the opinions of Britain and France were very close. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) British public opinion is gradually advocating for an arms control system, which should only be applied to the European continent. The German semi-official Konti news agency issued an article protesting this, saying, "The system of supervising armaments should either be applied to all countries without distinction or not used at all. Is it reasonable that Britain itself does not allow others to supervise its armaments, but wants to apply the supervisory system to the countries of the continent? Only countries whose armaments have been disarmed can determine the scope within which they can be worry-free." The conclusion states, "The so-called supervisory system is not to supervise the methods of reducing armaments stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles, but to supervise whether future arms agreements are implemented. It is necessary to sign this agreement." (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, French Foreign Minister Peng Gu had a meeting with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson for about an hour. Afterwards, Henderson took a car to Geneva at noon. The issues discussed by Peng Gu and Henderson today were the issues that were not resolved in the Anglo-French talks yesterday. However, during the discussion, Peng Gu still failed to provide satisfactory opinions on the matters that could not be resolved on Sunday. This afternoon, Peng Gu also met with U.S. representative Davis, and Davis visited French Prime Minister Daweidi at 5:30 PM, but the results of the talks were not detailed. At the moment, Parisian public opinion seems to be leaning towards optimism about the disarmament issue. Only the Times newspaper warned people not to expect too much, saying that the agreement in principle between Britain and France is not enough to dispel the difficulties ahead, and that every solution must be agreed upon by all the countries involved before it can be implemented.

<p>The Yokosuka Naval Arsenal has completed the submarine tender Daigei (7,500 tons), which was built since April 12. The launching ceremony is scheduled for November 16. The ship was built in a short period of only 279 days since its construction began, which is a new record in the history of Japanese naval shipbuilding. (20th Japan Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Japan cannot participate in the rapid shipbuilding competition of the U.S. Navy, Japan will definitely pass the 190 million yuan included in next year's budget out of the total cost of 470 million yuan for the replenishment plan. This firm determination is prevalent throughout the Navy. Therefore, Navy Minister Osumi, who contains the general intention of the Navy, is negotiating with Finance Minister Takahashi, seeking his understanding and promoting his determination. Furthermore, at the regular cabinet meeting on the 19th, Minister Osumi had a cordial talk with Prime Minister Saito and obtained his understanding. In addition, the second replenishment plan, such as aircraft and warships, will all be supplied by domestic products. Therefore, it can take the opportunity to receive the effects of large-scale relief for unemployment and encouraging industry. (20th Denttsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Navy and Army Authorities Attempt to Conceal the Truth</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The London Times on the 19th reported a dispatch from its Tokyo correspondent, stating that Japan is building a fortress on Chichijima Island in the Ogasawara Islands and has prohibited Reverend Heisler, who went to the island to preach, from landing. While the Ogasawara Islands are not under mandated rule, this proves that Japan is building fortresses on various islands under its South Seas mandate and simultaneously establishing aviation bases. If the Chichijima fortress was built after the signing of the 1922 Washington Treaty, it would clearly violate the treaty. The Japanese naval authorities denied this, stating that the fortress zone on Chichijima Island existed before the Washington Treaty was established, but it was only a zone in name and no fortress had been built. Furthermore, Japan respects the spirit of the Washington Naval Armaments Limitation Treaty. Not only on Chichijima Island, but also regarding the islands and territories stipulated in Article 19 of the treaty, namely "the islands and territories of Japan in the Pacific Ocean, including the Kurile Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, Amami Oshima, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, and the territories in the Pacific Ocean that Japan may acquire in the future," Japan has not built any fortresses or naval bases beyond maintaining the status quo. As for the prohibition of missionaries from landing, although it is not known when this occurred, since it is a fortress zone, it is natural for the authorities to take appropriate measures. Now, the spreading of this unfounded rumor in the news must be for some other purpose. Japan, standing on facts, will ignore this deliberate spread. (20th, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The London Times carried a Tokyo special dispatch, stating that Japan intends to expand the Ogasawara Islands into a fortress. Regarding this issue, the Japanese Army authorities issued their opinion on the 20th, the main points of which are as follows: The Chichijima fortress was originally started before the Washington Conference. However, after the Washington Treaty, there has been no increase in the defensive facilities of the project. As for the prohibition of missionaries from landing, the authorities have not received any reports, but since the area is a fortress location, from the standpoint of protecting military equipment, regardless of whether they are domestic or foreign, anyone who appears suspicious should be ordered to leave, which is the duty of the official in charge.

<p>Warsaw A local newspaper published a special article today discussing the Polish Foreign Minister's visit to Paris. The newspaper mentioned the plan proposed by France regarding the alliance of Danube countries, stating that this issue is difficult to resolve without Poland's participation in cooperation. It also stated that Colonel Beck's visit to Paris took place after the Rome talks and at a time when the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are consulting in Paris on the issue of reopening the Geneva Disarmament Conference, which contains particularly significant implications. In conclusion, the newspaper also pointed out that France's views on arms inspection are very close to those of Poland. (20th, Havas Telegraph)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden The famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh, who previously traveled from America to Europe via Greenland to survey the future air traffic route between Europe and America, has been here for many days. It was previously reported that Mr. Lindbergh planned to fly to the Soviet Union for a tour. This morning at ten o'clock, Mr. Lindbergh took off from Karlskrona, heading northeast. (20th, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Lysekil, Sweden Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh arrived safely here at 4:25 p.m. this afternoon after departing from Karlskrona, Sweden, this morning at 10:00 a.m. They will go to Leningrad, Soviet Russia. (20th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh stated today that their trip to Leningrad will be postponed for several days. Since Mr. Lindbergh made this statement, there has been widespread speculation that Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh are considering changing their plans and may fly over Siberia to China. Well-informed sources also said that Lindbergh had contacted United Airlines to remeasure the western end of the North Pacific air route. If implemented, he will fly to the Siberian coast and then head south to China. Previously, Lindbergh's flight to the Far East, although ostensibly for travel, was actually to survey the North Pacific air route for United Airlines. According to Lindbergh's friends, Lindbergh has not yet made a firm decision regarding flying to China. If implemented, he will fly to Beijing and Shanghai, and then fly to Japan and return home by ship. Lindbergh himself has not yet expressed an opinion on this, reportedly because he is waiting for a reply from the New York headquarters. (19th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Cuban Situation Remains Chaotic: Civil War Seemingly Inevitable</p>
<p>Opposition Party Raises the Banner of Rebellion: Student Faction Loyal to the Government</p>
<h3 id="e24">Rumors of President San Martin's Resignation Are Untrue <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Havana The confirmed news this morning is that the rumors circulating overseas about the resignation of Cuban President Grau San Martin are unfounded. Government officials are unaware of the source of these rumors. There have been two minor rebellions in Santa Clara Province, but the government claims they are not a cause for concern. (20th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Havana Professor Grau, who only assumed the presidency of Cuba for nine days, resigned from the Revolutionary Committee today. San Martin, who had been living abroad during the presidency of President Machado, was elected president by the Revolutionary Committee when Dr. Cespedes, who succeeded Machado as president, was overthrown. He had previously said that the crisis could be resolved soon, and now he has resigned, fulfilling his previous statement.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Committee has not yet decided whether to accept San Martin's resignation, while supporters of San Martin today marched in the streets, cheering "Long live San Martin!" (19th, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Havana The Cuban President has not yet agreed to the opposition party's request to reorganize the government. There have been two rebellions in Santa Clara Province. According to the opposition leader's opinion, the Cuban situation is heading towards civil war. One leader told reporters that if President Grau San Martin does not resign, allowing for the reorganization of the army and the resolution of the sugar problem, then civil war will be unavoidable. The rebellions in Santa Clara Province, one in Sancti Spíritus, led by former police chief Pires, and one in Morón, led by Hernández, both have fewer than five hundred people and lack strong support, making them easy for the government army to disperse. However, the opposition predicts that rebellions will arise one after another. The government, seeing the empty treasury, the lack of commercial recovery, and the difficulty in reorganizing finances, anticipates that disturbances are inevitable on the day the army receives its pay. It has organized student armies in several inland areas. The students are all revolutionary elements, loyal to the current government, and have pledged not to receive pay and to fulfill their obligations to the country. Today, a team of student soldiers joined the regular army and headed to Morón to suppress the rebels led by Hernández. According to tonight's news, the two sides have made contact near Tamarindo, but the outcome is unknown. This afternoon, five thousand students gathered in front of the Presidential Palace in Havana to declare their loyalty to President Grau San Martin and his government. It is also reported that there are serious labor strikes in Andilla and Mencanilla, and U.S. warships have sailed from Guantanamo to protect overseas Chinese. (19th, National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Reshuffling Ambassadors to European and American Countries: Promoting the Reopening of Negotiations on the China Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, wanting to break through isolated diplomacy, intends to convene Foreign Vice-Minister Shigemitsu and various directors in the near future to discuss a new diplomatic policy aimed at 1935. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that Japan's past diplomacy has emphasized instructions, losing its practical connection, so diplomatic errors often occur. In order to avoid this shortcoming, Foreign Minister Hirota will imitate Foreign Minister Tanaka Giichi's Eastern Conference, ordering ambassadors stationed abroad to return to the country to hold diplomatic conferences. If ambassadors are unable to return home due to the diplomatic situation in their place of appointment, then consuls-general or councilors will be ordered to return home. Because diplomacy with the United States has received the most criticism from the military, Hirota plans to order Ambassador Debuchi to return home soon. If Ambassador Debuchi cannot return home, then Consul-General Horiuchi of New York will be ordered to return home to negotiate. (20th, China United Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to refresh the Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel, Foreign Minister Hirota plans to replace ambassadors and ministers on a fairly broad scale to strengthen the diplomatic structure in times of emergency. The first step is that Ambassador Nagaoka to France, who returned to the country on the 19th, will specialize in the retirement of Michiichi Matsuda, who serves as a servant in the Imperial Household Ministry, which is almost certain. Naotake Satō, stationed in Belgium, will be appointed as Ambassador to France, Yotaro Sugimura as Ambassador to Belgium, Joji Ito, Deputy Director of the League of Nations Secretariat, as Minister to Poland, and Maoei Yano will be transferred to Minister to Chile. In addition, Ambassador Debuchi to the United States will return home at the end of the year, and Ambassador Matsudaira to the United Kingdom will also be realized in the Imperial Household Ministry next spring. After that, Ambassador Nagai to Germany will be transferred to Ambassador to the United States, and the call for Shigeru Yoshida to serve as Ambassador to the United Kingdom is very high. (20th, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations for the sale of the China Eastern Railway, which have been suspended since the fourth private consultation on August 23, are expected to resume as Foreign Minister Hirota takes office. Russian Ambassador Yurenev met with the Foreign Minister on the 18th to raise this issue, hoping for Japan's active mediation. After the Cabinet meeting on the 19th, the Foreign Minister specially met with Foreign Minister Saitō to exchange views on diplomatic issues. He reported the Foreign Minister's intention to carry out satisfactory negotiations between Russia and Manchuria, saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would issue recommendations to the two parties regarding conducting meetings. (20th, Japan United Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Manchukuo" Deputy Foreign Minister Ōhashi, who participated in the China Eastern Railway sale meeting, visited the Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying that the "Manchu" delegation is currently awaiting the Soviet Russian reply to the suggestions they have proposed. Soviet Russian representative Vakshlovsky promised to consider the exchange rate between the yen and the ruble. The "Manchu" side suggested that 2.50 yen be equal to one ruble, and declared that if the Soviet Russian side accepts the "Manchu" side's suggestion, they should pay attention to the subsidies of the China Eastern Railway employees. Ōhashi emphasized that they are currently only waiting for the Soviet Russian side to provide an answer to break the deadlock. (20th, Reuters Telegraph)</p>

The implementation of this plan is due to the fact that Russian and "Manchu" personnel on the China Eastern Railway have not yet reached an agreement on the return of vehicles withdrawn into Russian territory. Currently, the local press is paying close attention to the attitude of the railway authorities, but there have been no major developments. Various "Manchu" personnel have repeatedly issued statements to the press, stating that if Soviet Russian personnel do not sincerely accept the suggestions for reforming management and reach an agreement, then strict countermeasures will be taken.

<p>Resist Substantial Inflation of Gold Dollar: Pittman Suggests Widespread Minting of Silver Coins</p>
<p>Salt Lake City The western states of the United States are launching a movement to protect silver prices and resist the genuine substantial inflation of the gold dollar. Owners of silver and gold mines in the mountain states, seeing that the inflation currency resolution in the Washington Cotton Conference will harm the true interests of the mining industry, have launched this movement. Today, two silver plans have been submitted to the President, declaring that there is no need for further inflation at present. The first plan, proposed by Senator Thomas, advocates minting various silver coins with newly produced silver from the mines, which will be claimed by the mines. It is estimated that the new silver coins minted each month in the initial implementation of this policy will not exceed four million yuan, and it will not be easy to feel the impact of inflation currency in circulation in the market. The second plan, proposed by Senator Pittman, suggests minting 33 million yuan of silver coins annually. (20th, National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Can Block More Than 100 Million Yuan of Leakage Annually</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 19th, Song Ziwen, after returning to China, attended the Executive Yuan meeting for the first time and proposed the cultivation of the salt area to benefit the people's livelihood, as the first step in implementing economic construction. His proposal stated: "Upon investigation, merchants and people in the Lianghuai salt area have engaged in cultivation in the past, but no success has been seen to date. As the sea erodes eastward, the silt land is becoming wider day by day, which is suitable for cotton and wheat. If it can be rectified and improved, and guided according to its advantages, it will greatly benefit the people's livelihood and the national treasury. Moreover, our country's cotton and wheat imports are very large. If the salt area is developed with pooled funds, then in a few years, we will no longer be dependent on foreign countries, and more than 100 million yuan of leakage can be blocked annually. This salt land has always belonged to the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Finance has already established an office for organizing the salt area, but the scale is small and not enough to fundamentally seek organization. It is now proposed that the above salt area be handed over to the Economic Committee for design and operation, with relevant agencies participating, and the Ministry of Finance will cooperate and proceed effectively." It is reported that this proposal has been passed by the Executive Yuan meeting. (20th, Special Telegraph)</p>

The second defense line is the main line, located in Zhengjiatun between Shenyang and Changchun. The third defense line is the plan to establish containment of the epidemic in Sipingjie. The Kwantung Government, the South Manchuria Railway, and the staff of the Japanese Mission to Manchuria are now sparing no expense to strictly inspect passengers and establish isolation facilities. Other precautionary measures are also being taken, such as bathing and disinfection, exterminating rats, and suspending ship traffic. It is found that in 1928 there was a plague in Manchuria, with a total of 1,200 deaths. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Dispatch of Puppet Ships to Navigate the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Naval and Air Forces Meet with Head-on Demonstrations</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army Active in the Four Counties of Eastern Jilin</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: Since the Japanese army invaded Northeast China, the international rivers between China and Russia have not seen Chinese merchant ships for more than a year. This year, after the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers thawed, the puppet navigation bureau used the excuse of opening the navigation routes on both rivers to actually reconnoiter the movements of the Soviet Russian Far East Army. It first dispatched the "Harbin" and "Shanghai" ships to the Heilongjiang River, reaching as far as Heihe, and they were able to reach their destination safely. During the journey, they passed the Russian shore without encountering any obstacles. Therefore, the bureau believed that the navigation of the Ussuri River should be no problem. On May 22nd, it again dispatched the "Ping'an" and "Tongshan" ships to sail down the river. The "Ping'an" arrived at Hulin, the last pier on the Ussuri River, before the "Tongshan." Although it was pursued by Russian ships during the voyage, there were no accidents. Only when passing through Suiyuan County, where Yuan Futing's National Salvation Army was stationed (some say that Yuan is Yuan Chonggu, the commander of the reclamation army during the Jiangqiao battle in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic), the National Salvation Army sent soldiers aboard to inspect the ships and escort them. On the return trip, they were not allowed to carry merchants and residents from Hulin, Raohe, and Suiyuan counties for export, but there were no other disturbances. When "Ping'an" returned to Tongjiang, "Tongshan" saw that it had returned safely and, carrying out the orders of the puppet navigation bureau, continued its navigation. When passing the base of the Russian River Defense Fleet at Xu'ergu on the Russian shore, six of its warships sailed out, surrounded "Tongshan," and anchored in the middle of the river. The Russian Marines boarded the ship and searched for Japanese officers and Russians. They arrested twelve White Russian employees, and then released the ship, which continued to sail downstream. Upon reaching Hulin, it was detained by the National Salvation Army and ordered to travel back and forth between the three counties of Hu, Rao, and Suiyuan for military and commercial transportation. After the ship was detained, the puppet state was greatly angered and sent Shi Liben, a special envoy from its diplomatic department stationed in Harbin, to protest to Russia, saying that the National Salvation Army was an anti-Manchu army nurtured by the Soviet Union and that it should immediately release the "Tongshan" merchant ship. The Russian side instructed its consul in Harbin to reply that the detention of "Tongshan" had nothing to do with Russia and that only the White Russian employees on the ship had been arrested for interrogation due to their military espionage activities. Seeing that the protest was ineffective, the puppet state vigorously built new river defense warships, a total of five, which were secretly built at the Osaka Shipyard in Japan last year and shipped to Harbin this year to be assembled. They were completed one after another in mid-June, namely "Datong," "Limin," "Enmin," "Pumin," and "Huimin." The ships were extremely small, with a draft of no more than one foot and five inches, carrying 25 crew members, and could travel 60 li per hour with the current. They were fast river boats powered by light gasoline, and each boat could be equipped with several light and heavy machine guns. The Japanese, who were manipulating behind the puppet state, believed that with such new river defense equipment, they had more than enough to deal with Russia. Therefore, in mid-July, after the five ships were launched one after another, Yin Zuogan, the commander of the puppet river defense fleet, led "Enmin," "Huimin," "Pumin," and the old river defense ships "Lisui," "Jiangqing," and "Jiang'an," a total of six ships, and supervised and commanded by a group of Japanese sailors, and sailed downstream overnight. The original plan was to sail directly to the Ussuri River, partly to demonstrate against Russia and to create a strong intimidation for the Tokyo Conference on the sale of the East Railway, and partly to attack the National Salvation Army and recapture the "Tongshan." By the 29th, the ships had passed Tongjiang, and by the 31st, they had sailed out of Sanjiangkou. Before reaching Xu'ergu, more than ten Russian warships sailed down the river to intercept them, and seaplanes were also flying in the air. The extent of their demonstration against the puppet state was even greater than that of the puppet state. Seeing the strength of the Russian navy and that its warships were all large and sturdy, with firepower far superior to that of the five newly built ships of the puppet state, the puppet state was concerned that there might be danger in returning after sailing to the Ussuri River, and especially feared that the Russian ships would cut off their retreat. Therefore, they sailed to Molihong outside Sanjiangkou and anchored, sending people to negotiate with Russia to explain the true intention of sailing to the Ussuri River. The Russian side replied that although the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers were international rivers in the past, China has never had the right to sail warships on them. Since the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers are close to the Russian border, they are like inland rivers of Soviet Russia. Therefore, the security of all the river surfaces is maintained by Soviet Russian warships, and there is no need for Chinese warships to come, lest misunderstandings occur. If the Manchurian state really wants to attack the National Salvation Army, it may as well send troops by land, why send warships and make Soviet Russia suspicious. After receiving the reply, the puppet fleet commander Yin Zuogan did not dare to lead the fleet directly forward, so he telegraphed the puppet government for instructions, and at the same time sent a letter to Yuan Futing, the commander of the National Salvation Army, requesting the release of the "Tongshan" ship, otherwise the army, navy, and air force would attack together. Yuan replied that if he wanted the "Tongshan" to return, he must send another merchant ship. Seeing no results, Yin led the fleet back to Tongjiang on August 2nd. On the 7th and 8th, the ships sailed back to Harbin in two batches. This demonstration by the six ships against Russia ended in failure. However, the Japanese were very eager to find out about the Soviet Russian naval armaments, intending to prepare for an attack in case the Sino-Russian War broke out on the day of the rupture of the Eastern Railway negotiations. Therefore, Kobayashi, the Rear Admiral of the Japanese naval commander stationed in Manchuria, departed on August 3rd aboard the "Guangning" river warship, intending to first reconnoiter along the Heilongjiang River and then go to the Ussuri River, ostensibly to explore the location of gold mines. On August 7th, the ship arrived in Tongjiang. Rumors that the Russian side had already prepared a protest, saying that the Ussuri River and the Heilong River were international rivers between China and the Soviet Union, and that warships flying the Japanese flag could not enter, dampened Kobayashi's trip to Heihe. In the Hulin area, the strength of the National Salvation Army was very strong. Those belonging to Yuan Futing numbered about 20,000, and those belonging to Chen Dongshan numbered about 30,000. Liu Wankui's branch was recently organizing training near Baipaozi in the Xingkai Lake area and contacting the local patriotic volunteer army, also numbering around 20,000. Mishan County was recovered by Chen Dongshan's army on August 6th. Therefore, the four counties of Jidong, Hu, Rao, Sui, and Mi, are still within the sphere of influence of the National Salvation Army. However, in mid-August, the puppet state river defense fleet sailed to the Ussuri River for the second time. It was heard that on the 21st, it passed Suiyuan and went upstream, directly to Hulin. The Hulin National Salvation Army was attacked by the Matsuda Regiment and Hamada Detachment of the Japanese 10th Division and the puppet state army from Mishan, and were attacked from both front and back, and had to retreat temporarily to the Gushanzishan area. A part of Chen Dongshan's army temporarily retreated to Baoqing. The puppet state river defense warships were able to reach their destination along the river without obstruction, retrieve the two merchant ships "Tongshan" and "Beizhen," and sailed back to Harbin on September 9th. Although the righteous army retreated temporarily, it was only for strategic reasons. After the puppet state river defense fleet left, they returned to Hulin and Suiyuan. (September 10th)</p>

<p>The Story of Yang Zengxin's Assassination and the Reasons for Jin Shuren's Expulsion</p>
<p>Huang Musong's Mission of Appeasement was Ineffective, Luo Wengan Continued to Soothe and Pacify</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" of Peiping (Beijing) reports that a Westerner recently returned from Xinjiang, discussing the origins of the new changes, which in reality contain ethnic meanings. Adding to this is the presence of foreigners, with mutual animosity between White Russians and Red Russians, leading to further exacerbation. The entangled Hui people have come to be divided into two, mutually incompatible. Tracing the origins of the entangled Hui, they are in fact of Turkic origin, with pointed heads and noses, and mostly bearded. One part resides in the plains, in cities and towns, specializing in farming, while others live in the valleys, mostly engaged in animal husbandry. Another type is a mixed race of Arab and Han people, called the Donggan, that is, the commonly known "Hui Hui." Although these two groups belong to the same Islamic faith, they are extremely incompatible, like ice and charcoal. Therefore, the Chinese government often utilizes this opportunity to control this remote province. Aside from these two groups, there are also some Han Chinese, including bureaucrats, soldiers, merchants, and workers from Shandong Province. Although their numbers are not large, their potential power is considerable, and they often follow the lead of the central government, as their situation dictates. The Russians who have recently entered Xinjiang, although few in number (approximately 10,000), are very influential in Xinjiang's politics. Red Party members are mostly attached to the Russian consulates and the Soviet Russian import and export companies. The White Russians are those who fled to Xinjiang Province from Russian Turkestan in the eighth year of the Republic, due to their inability to tolerate the oppression of the Red Russians. At that time, the Xinjiang government wanted to recruit them to quell the Hui rebellion, and specifically threatened that if they did not serve China, they would be sent back to Russia. In order to save their lives, these people had no choice but to be employed by the new government. In this way, 4,000 White Russians were recruited and equipped with weapons to quell the rebellion, like crushing dry weeds. The Xinjiang government has been able to maintain security in recent years, largely relying on their strength. Unexpectedly, those of different races have different hearts. In the future, the rebellion will not come from the rebellious entangled Hui, but from the White Russian soldiers relied upon as the Great Wall.</p>

At that time, a certain Fan coveted political power and, taking advantage of Yang's public banquet at the Diplomatic Office, suddenly assassinated him. His arrangements can also be said to be very meticulous. It is not known whether red elements were involved in the conspiracy, but it can be asserted that they were inciting the chaos. Unexpectedly, Fan's reputation was not well-received, and the soldiers did not obey, eventually leading to chaos. Fan also paid the price for his crimes. Therefore, Jin Shuren, a key member of the Kuomintang, took the stage and became chairman. The winds and clouds met, and the National Government also trusted him. Only then did he hold great power and suddenly become the leader of the people. After Jin took office, he was opposed by all parties, and he himself was very mediocre, with no achievements. His first policy was to amass wealth, increasing taxes and levies, so that the people could not live. In addition, he greatly reduced personnel, replacing them with people he brought in. All of Jin's relatives, old friends, and those who usually fawned on him were promoted overnight. Since these people came to make a fortune, how could they let go of any opportunity? Knowing that they would only be officials for a short time, would they not desperately exploit the people? Due to ethnic concepts in that area, intermarriage between Hui and Han has not yet become widespread. Han women rarely marry into the remote border areas. The people used by Jin often forcibly seized women from the people, leading to deeper and deeper hatred. Jin himself lived in seclusion and remained in the government office all day long. Even if he occasionally went out, he would always be hidden in an armored car, never daring to show his face. To this day, the people of Xinjiang do not know whether Jin is fat or thin, unlike Yang, who traveled lightly and often socialized with the local elders.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Entangled Hui Rebellion <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic, after Yang's position became vacant, the Hui people saw that political affairs were neglected, and so in the eastern part of Xinjiang, they openly raised arms and revolted. The Hui bandit leader Ma Zhonglin again led bandits from Gansu to assist them. Because the government soldiers' weapons were sharp, they were easily defeated. If they had been handled seriously, it would not have been difficult to resolve the issue fundamentally. However, the Chinese government never handled things thoroughly. Allowing the bandits to exist was a way to raise soldiers. If the bandits were wiped out, then the soldiers would have no use. As a result, the entire province spread, and all places were lost. By the 22nd year of the Republic, Ma Zhonglin rebelled again and attacked various parts of Xinjiang. Hui bandits rose up in response. Hami was lost, and Ma immediately attacked Dihua. Jin then sent White Russian troops to defend it, and they won a great victory. If they had taken advantage of the victory to pursue and suppress the rebellion, it would not have been difficult to wipe it out in one fell swoop. However, Jin felt that he had no kindness to the Hui people and was deeply afraid that the people's hearts would change, endangering his own life. He quickly ordered the troops to return to defend Dihua. At that time, three thousand men under Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen happened to be returning to the country from Russia, passing through Dihua. If Jin Shuren could have treated them with sincerity and recruited them for his own use, the Hui rebellion in Xinjiang would not have been so serious, and order in various places could have been restored immediately. Ma and Su's old troops were all veterans who had survived hundreds of battles and had fought bitterly with the Japanese army in Heilongjiang, experiencing dozens of battles. Jin was suspicious by nature and only gave them a few weapons as a perfunctory measure. From then on, the northeastern heroes also felt disheartened. Later, they mostly took a wait-and-see attitude towards the rebellion, and eventually took concerted action with the rebel party. If Jin had not provoked them, who would have believed it? By this year, if Jin had not deducted the White Russian troops' pay and rations, things would not have reached an uncontrollable point. Jin was quite xenophobic, as evidenced by his high-handed treatment of the Sino-French academic expedition. Afterwards, he became close to the Red Army, and the White Russian troops' pay and rations were not paid. This spring, Kashgar and other places in the northeast rebelled one after another, with great momentum. Jin ordered the White Russian troops to go out and conquer, but unexpectedly, the soldiers, who had not been paid for months, resisted and refused to obey. The northeastern heroes who had returned to the country from Russia also stayed in Dihua and delayed. The rebels were gradually approaching the provincial capital. Before long, the White Russian troops sent Jin an ultimatum, urging him to step down immediately, guaranteeing his safety, and promising to escort him to Russia, declaring their support for Liu Wenlong, the director of the Education Department, as the provincial governor. Because Liu was popular and the position of provincial governor was only nominal and a figure of transition. At this point, Jin was still reluctant to give up his post. After the deadline passed, there was no response. At this point, the White Russian troops joined forces with Ma and Su's old troops to jointly take action against Jin, surrounding the government office and fighting fiercely with his guards for two days. Jin's personal property was burned and looted, and as many as 4,000 guards were killed. Jin disguised himself and fled at night, reaching Chugurchak on the Russian border, and from there returned to Tianjin. From then on, he could live a leisurely life and enjoy his remaining years. Although Dihua had undergone a rebellion, the people suffered very little, which was a comforting thought. As the war was coming to an end, the central government sent Envoy Huang Weixian to Dihua to comfort and pacify the people, and planned to disband the Xinjiang government. Unexpectedly, Huang's relationship with all parties soured as soon as he got off the train. Before declaring the central government's wishes, he first became a prisoner. Afterwards, after repeated mediation, he was allowed to return south by plane. As far as this reporter knows, Huang said that everything had been settled and boasted shamelessly. We cannot help but thank Huang for his ability to mediate. After Huang returned, Foreign Minister Luo personally came forward. The central government immediately recognized Liu Wenlong as chairman, and the leaders of Kashgar and other places came to submit. The central government's authority was still in effect, but examining the actual situation, it is doubtful whether it can last. Foreign Minister Luo, as a senior official of the central government, took on the heavy responsibility of mediating disputes and pacifying the Hui people, so that the northwestern key town would listen to the government's command. His hardship and dedication are self-evident. Let us wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Recovery of Kaihua County <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Red Bandits of Fang and Shao Captured the County Seat on the 17th, Which Has Been Recovered by the Security Team and Xing's Division. The Bandits Are Fleeing to Wuyuan and Other Places in the Northwest.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Communication: Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, was captured by the Red Bandits of Fang and Shao taking advantage of the opportunity on the 17th. It was recovered on the 18th by the Third Regiment of the Security Team and Xing Zhennan's Division. The bandits are fleeing to Wuyuan and other places in the northwest. They are being pursued. The text of the telegrams received by the Provincial Government from various parties yesterday (20th) is recorded as follows: (1) Kaihua County Magistrate Qiao telegraphs, (At dawn on the 17th of this month, more than 5,000 Red Bandits, with approximately 1,000 rifles, as well as machine guns, hand-held wooden shell hand grenades, etc., surrounded and attacked the west, south, and north gates of the subordinate county. My county's basic team, the fifth and sixth detachments, the second district team, in addition to sending scouts to guard the blockhouses, only had 52 team members to resist the bandits for about one hour, killing more than ten bandits and wounding more than twenty. Four of my team members died and five were injured. The incident was sudden, and the troops stationed in Huabu did not have time to rescue them. My team was outnumbered and the bandits swarmed into the city, emptying the prison. As a last resort, we retreated outside the east gate across the river. The bandits crossed the river and pursued us in large numbers. We continued to retreat to Sanliting, waiting for reinforcements before launching a counterattack. By 8:00 PM that day, my team had not received reinforcements and dispersed into various mountain valleys, firing shots one after another. The bandits suspected that reinforcements had arrived and retreated westward at about 10:00 PM that night. At 5:00 AM this morning, I led the team into the city to maintain order. This time, the county seat suffered a terrible bandit robbery. The government agencies and the masses suffered heavy losses, and many men and women were captured.) (2) Hao, the Third Sub-district Director of Security stationed in Quzhou, telegraphs, (1. According to reports from various counties, the bandits who captured Kaihua this time are called the Fourth Division, numbering three to four thousand, with about one thousand guns, eight machine guns, and a commander named Zhou. They also have Mao Zedong's proclamations. They entered the city on the morning of the 17th. On the morning of the 18th, knowing that our reinforcements had arrived in Huabu, they retreated at noon, claiming to attack Wuyuan, etc. 2. I have sent Inspectors Jiang Zhihang and Commissioner Wang to Kai to assist County Magistrate Zhu in handling the aftermath.) (3) Wang Hantao, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the First Special Zone, telegraphs, (I arrived in Huabu at 4:00 PM. I learned that 1. Jiang's regiment entered Kaihua City on the morning of the 19th. The Red Bandits fled from the eleventh district of the west township. County Magistrate Zhu also returned to the city to take office on that day. 2. The Red Bandits who entered the city numbered approximately 3,000. 3. To prevent bandits from infiltrating, I have personally discussed with Deputy Division Commander Song to send troops to search and suppress them immediately, in order to eliminate them. 4. I will go to Kaihua on the morning of the 20th to discuss the aftermath with County Magistrate Zhu.) (4) Zhang Xianyi, County Magistrate of Changshan, telegraphs, (According to reliable reports, the bandits of Kaihua retreated in two groups. The majority retreated towards Majinling via Zhangcun and Zhongcun, and a part retreated towards Baishaguan. When passing through Baishaguan on the morning of the 18th, they came into contact with Shi's regiment. After holding each other for about one hour, they fled westward. At the oil creek pass. There are still sporadic scattered bandits on the nearby mountains. Deputy Division Commander Song is sending troops to suppress them. The 1st Battalion and 3rd Company of my Jiang regiment, except for the 13th company, which is still stationed in Kaihua, returned to Huabu on the night of the 19th.) (September 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e108">Chiang Orders the Abolition of Redundant Agencies in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Transferring Funds to Supplement County Administration Expenses</p>
<p>And Promulgating County Administration Guidelines</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication) Chairman Chiang has emphasized that this campaign to suppress bandits should be based on the principle of "30% military, 70% political," and that in the political aspect, the county is the starting point and the destination. Therefore, the selection of county magistrates is extremely important. He has repeatedly ordered the provincial governments to select intelligent and capable individuals who can reverse the chaos to fill the positions. At the same time, he has also ordered the county magistrates in the bandit areas to abandon their mentality of seeking personal comfort and avoiding responsibility, and to be determined to share the weal and woe of the people and to coexist with the city. However, since the responsibilities of county magistrates are so heavy, their treatment should be improved. In addition to appointing the county magistrates in the bandit suppression areas as military judges to control everything, he has also ordered the troops stationed in various places to respect the county magistrates and enhance their prestige. He has also decided to expand the county administration expenses to achieve political effectiveness. He has also ordered various provinces to save wasteful expenses and transfer funds to supplement the county administration expenses. According to the Guling telegram, Chiang telegraphed Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan on the 15th, ordering them to abolish all redundant agencies and all redundant personnel, and to use the funds saved to increase the county administration expenses. He also formulated four guidelines for refreshing county administration, ordering them to be carefully handled in consideration of the local environment. His telegram reads, (The county government is close to the people and is the foundation for promoting politics. The quality of politics depends on the integrity of the county magistrate. However, because the administrative expenses of various counties are too small, the county magistrate cannot afford to be honest and govern well. All kinds of corrupt practices are mostly caused by this. In order to rectify the situation, the county administrative expenses should be increased.) After receiving the telegram, Chairman Xiong of the Jiangxi Provincial Government immediately summoned the heads of various departments to discuss ways to reduce personnel and government expenditures and increase county administrative expenses, and presented the environmental needs of various counties in the province for approval, determining the steps to be implemented.

<h3 id="e109">Shandong Relief Committee Distributes Central Government Relief Funds <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Distributing According to the Severity of the Disaster, Kou Yingjie Donates 5,000 Yuan for Disaster Relief, Relief Committee Plans to Borrow 500,000 for Relief</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The Central Government recently decided to allocate 500,000 yuan to provide relief for the Shandong disaster and telegraphed Han Fuju to first borrow the funds from the Shandong Provincial Government to provide emergency relief. The Provincial Government has successively advanced more than 200,000 yuan. Yesterday (17th), the Central Government remitted the first batch of relief funds of 100,000 yuan to Jinan. The Provincial Relief Committee immediately held a meeting to discuss the distribution method, but there was no result. At 10:00 AM this morning (18th), the Provincial Relief Committee continued to hold a meeting to discuss. Committee members Li Shuchun, Zhang Weicun, Zhao Xinru, Xin Zhujiu, He Supu, etc., agreed to distribute emergency relief according to the severity of the disaster in the severely affected areas, the second most severely affected areas, and the third most severely affected areas. Together with the 82,000 yuan of donations received from various parties before, a total of 182,000 yuan will be distributed. The personnel distributing the funds will still be Zhang Shouqian, advisor to the Provincial Government, for the south bank of the Yellow River, and Li Tianni, advisor, for the counties on the north bank. The Provincial Relief Committee will send personnel to assist. The number of relief funds to be distributed to each county is as follows: (1) Puyang, Fanxian, Shouzhang, Yanggu, Heze, Cao County, Juye, and Dong'a counties, each county previously received 6,000 yuan in donations, and now each county will receive an additional 7,000 yuan in Central Government relief funds. (2) Jiaxiang, Shanxian, Chengwu, Dingtao, Dongping, and Yuncheng counties, each county previously received 4,000 yuan in donations, and now each county will receive an additional 4,000 yuan in Central Government relief funds. (3) Jining, Yutai, Feicheng, Juancheng, Changqing, and other five counties, each county previously received 2,000 yuan in donations, and now each county will receive an additional 1,000 yuan in Central Government relief funds. In addition, 3,000 yuan will be allocated to Jining and 2,000 yuan to Wenshang. The Central Government relief funds will total 90,000 yuan. The remaining 10,000 yuan will subsidize the Heze disaster relief shelter with 6,000 yuan and the Shouzhang disaster relief shelter with 4,000 yuan. The Provincial Relief Committee also ordered various counties to quickly prepare for winter relief, considering that the autumn season is deep and the weather is getting cold, and winter is coming soon. They should handle the disaster relief shelters as appropriate, and the Relief Committee will provide appropriate subsidies for expenses.</p>
<p>Former Henan Military Rehabilitation Supervisor Kou Yingjie, because his hometown was severely affected by the disaster, specifically donated 5,000 yuan to provide relief to Dong'a and Shouzhang counties. Kou arrived in Jinan from Tianjin with the funds yesterday. Xu Zushan, the commissioner of Weihaiwei, is also concerned about the disaster victims and generously donated 1,000 yuan. The total of the above two donations is 6,000 yuan, which will be distributed by the Relief Committee.</p>
<p>The Provincial Relief Committee believes that the disaster area in Shandong Province reaches more than 20 counties, with millions of disaster victims. Relief for food and clothing requires a large sum of relief funds. Although the Central Government has promised to allocate 500,000 yuan, only 100,000 yuan has been remitted so far, and it is unknown when the rest will be remitted. Therefore, it is planned to request the Provincial Government to transfer 500,000 yuan from the Central Bank, which will be repaid by the relief funds allocated by the Central Government in the future. This petition is currently being drafted. (18th)</p>

<p>The Punan seawall in this county has been in a state of disrepair for years. Despite the provincial government allocating funds and manpower for large-scale repairs, the seawall's collapse has reached an extreme point. It has suffered repeated heavy damage from severe storms in July and August of this year. Furthermore, from the evening of the 17th to noon on the 19th, it was subjected to a continuous series of hurricanes, coupled with rain. Occurring during the autumn high tide season, the terrifying waves and surging tides pounded with immense force, threatening the mountains and creating a perilous situation all around. Li Yihua, the patrolling officer of the county, sent urgent telegrams to the county government, stating briefly: (At 12:00 last night, a southeast hurricane suddenly arose here, accompanied by torrential rain. Today, it is even more rampant, and the situation is more severe than before. The Songjiang seawall has long been in need of repair, and the dangers are numerous. Coupled with the autumn high tide season, it is difficult to guarantee that the raging waves and violent winds will not cause a major disaster. In addition to gathering the seawall chiefs to temporarily hire laborers for round-the-clock guarding to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, I respectfully telegram Your Excellency to quickly dispatch workers to assist, and also request that you forward this to the Prefect to allocate funds for repairs. Li Yihua, Songjiang Patrolling Officer, kowtows respectfully). Another telegram said: (I trust that Your Excellency has received my urgent telegram. Around 7:00 last night, the wind intensified, and after 10:00, the sea tide rose sharply. The terrifying waves and surging tides had the force of mountains collapsing. The tide water overflowed the seawall surface, making it almost impossible to stand. The magnitude of the wind and tide was rarely seen in recent times, causing widespread panic. I immediately led the seawall chiefs and laborers to transport sacks, floodgates, etc., to carefully protect the seawall. Fortunately, no major danger occurred. It was not until 3:40 this morning that the wind turned northwest, and the tide receded, that the situation stabilized somewhat. I immediately conducted a segment-by-segment survey and determined that from the first to the ninth sections, over 300 tree trunks had been broken. In the third section, more than half of the stone slope of the cement project was destroyed. Soil and stones in each section also had collapses and disturbances. Currently, the wind is still strong, and I am still leading laborers to intensify emergency protection. After the wind subsides, I will submit a separate detailed report. I respectfully telegraph this first. Li Yihua, Songjiang Patrolling Officer, kowtows).</p>

<p>Tang, the wife of Huang Heshang, a resident of No. 7 Xilong Lane in Fengqiao Town, is 30 years old and has already given birth to three sons. She recently became pregnant again. On the night before last (the 18th), she went into labor. Because the baby came out bottom first, the child's head could not emerge for a long time, and its limbs were moving erratically. The midwife, Cai Xu, actually used large scissors to cut off the fetus's head at the neck, causing the baby's head to become trapped in the mother's abdomen, resulting in two immediate deaths. The incident was discovered by the police, who arrested Huang and Cai Xu and brought them to the city. The local court dispatched a prosecutor to the village on the 20th to investigate. They found the body of the mother lying horizontally on a bed, covered in blood. The headless body of the child had already turned into a mass of blood and flesh, a truly tragic sight.</p>

<p>A monk named Genyuan from Shangkong Temple in Mudu Town, Suzhou, led over a hundred male and female pilgrims in four boats, towed by a small steamboat, to Longhua Temple for pilgrimage some time ago. However, while passing through the Dongtingzi Village area of Zhengyi, it was nighttime, and the engine of the steamboat suddenly broke down, so they stopped for repairs. The pilgrims fought over sleeping berths, resulting in a conflict, even shouting for help. The villagers mistakenly thought it was a bandit alert and reported it to the Zhengjie Security Corps, which immediately assembled urgently and set off in different directions to apprehend the "bandits." Upon reaching the destination, they learned the true situation and immediately returned in formation. At that time, the steamboat had also been repaired and continued sailing. Upon arriving in Kunshan, they discovered that the pilgrimage leader, Monk Genyuan, was missing. They suspected that he had fallen into the river during the commotion. His mother, Wang Ma, immediately disembarked and, along with many others, went to the docking location to search. They recovered the body yesterday at noon. The responsible police district reported this to the Kunshan County government, which dispatched personnel to investigate.</p>

<p>The butchers of this county, feeling oppressed by the monopolistic merchants and burdened by the excessive tax increases, were unable to bear the pressure. Businesses in Zhenze and Pingwang once suspended operations, but no satisfactory solution was reached. Currently, all the butchers in the county held a meeting in Jiangji on the 18th, resolving to send four representatives – Yin Lianfang, Zhou Youqin, Jiang Liancheng, and Shi Tianqiu – to Beijing to petition for the removal of the monopolistic merchants. The representatives were scheduled to go to Beijing today (the 19th) to petition the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, determined to achieve the goal of replacing the monopolistic merchants.</p>

<p>Central Committee member Wang Boling, while residing in his hometown to care for his parents, would often venture into the suburbs in his leisure time to explore historical sites. Yesterday, the 18th, he, along with Wu Xiaoyuan, Wang Runquan, and others, visited the old site of Guangling City, the former capital of Emperor Yang of Sui, reaching about two li north of Guanyin Mountain (the northern wall of the former Sui city, known as Baogu City in the Tang Dynasty). Suddenly, they saw a desolate tomb mound, still standing tall. In the weeds, there was an overturned monument with eroded inscriptions. Upon further inspection of the reverse side of the monument, the writing appeared new, exceptionally elegant. They determined that it was the tomb of Madame Li, the wife of Luo Jingfu from Longyou County, Zhejiang. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, when Shi Kefa died valiantly and Yangzhou was subjected to looting and rape by Qing soldiers, Madame Li gathered all twelve women of her family in a building, set it on fire, and immolated themselves to preserve their chastity. Therefore, the prefectural school had a "Guangling Twelve Heroic Women Shrine," with Madame Li as their leader. After more than three hundred years, her hidden virtue and silent glory were discovered unintentionally. It is said that Central Committee member Wang praised their chastity and heroism and intends to repair the tomb to promote the hidden virtue of our women who resisted foreign invaders and preserved their honor.</p>

<p>In Nantong, on the 19th, violent winds and heavy rain struck, and the river tide rose furiously. From Xiangshan east of Langshan to Kuzi Port, large sections of the river embankment collapsed in over ten places simultaneously. The tide water rushed in, causing areas such as Gonggao, Huangma, Zilang, Dexing, Ziyang, and Langyin townships to be submerged under water, six or seven feet deep. Houses were destroyed, and countless people and animals were drowned. Various groups in the city have rushed to provide emergency relief and dispatched lifeboats to rescue men and women in the disaster area. The Embankment Protection Association has purchased large quantities of sacks, firewood, and stones to try to block the breaches. The scale of the disaster is significant. The Huangni and Huang'an mountains are currently submerged in water. The Embankment Protection Association has sent an urgent telegram to the provincial government requesting disaster relief.</p>

<p>After the young aviator Sun Tonggang flew from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the 11th, he was warmly welcomed by all sectors. Sun and his classmate Wang Zuwen spent days visiting scenic spots such as West Lake and Mogan Mountain. They originally planned to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the "National Salvation Aircraft" in this province, but the ceremony was postponed due to rain. Sun and Wang could not wait any longer and went to the Jianqiao Aviation School by car at 8:00 yesterday (the 20th) to bid farewell to Mao Bangchu and others. They then went to the airport to repair the aircraft. They took off at 9:20. Because the various government agencies were unaware of Sun's travel schedule, they were unable to arrive in time to see him off. Only Cao Baoqing, Deputy Director of the Aviation Administration, and many officers and students from the Aviation School were present. Before his departure, Sun told reporters that he was deeply grateful for the kindness of all sectors, but due to the urgency of time, he could not bid farewell to everyone individually. He would arrive in Anqing at 1:00 this afternoon. After a short rest, he would transfer to Hankou, stay for two days, and then fly to Changsha, before flying directly to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, completing his ambition to fly across the country.</p>

<p>According to a report submitted by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, the Zhejiang Provincial Capital Martial Law Command interrogated three bandits: Zhao Jinsheng, and suspects Lian Dumei and Xu A'na, along with items such as handguns, bullets, and bayonets. It was found that Zhao Jinsheng had conspired with Lin Jingyi and seven others who were at large on the night of April 7th of this year to rob the house of Cai Fengzhi at Xinqiaotou. After the robbery, they returned to the house of Kong Defa at No. 22 Sanguan Lane in this city. Subsequently, Kong and others sent four threatening letters to Cai Fengzhi, extorting a large sum of money. They agreed to hand over the money at Qianqiao around May 25th. The Public Security Bureau dispatched detectives and police officers in disguise. They found a loaded handgun on the spot and arrested Zhao Jinsheng, Lian Dumei, and the homeowner Xu A'na. Zhao Jinsheng confessed to the robbery. Except for Lian Dumei and the others who were transferred to the court for handling, Zhao Jinsheng was sentenced to death according to law. Yesterday (the 20th) at 8:00 AM, Zhao was taken to the scene of the incident, his identity was verified, and he was executed by firing squad.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Chairman Mayers of Sino-British Bank Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Two Railway Administrations Held Banquet the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Mr. S.F. Mayers, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Bank, arrived in Shanghai on September 10th aboard the Empress of Russia from England. His mission is to investigate the situation of the various railways in China invested in and built by the bank. Since the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways were also built with loans from the bank, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Railway Administrations, and Wu Shaozeng, Deputy Director, hosted a banquet for Mr. Mayers on the evening of September 19th. Also invited were Mr. Davison and Mr. Pusey, representatives of the Sino-British Bank in China, Zhong Wenyao, Desborough, Biggers, Railway Department Advisor Cundill, former Two Railway Administrations Supervisor Huang Yichang, and financial leaders Zhang Gongquan, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Xinliu, Tang Baoshu, and Wen Tou. Director Huang first gave a welcome speech, followed by Mr. Mayers's reply. The banquet concluded on a joyful note. It is reported that Mr. Mayers will begin his investigation soon. Director Huang's welcome speech and Mr. Mayers's reply are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Railway Administration Welcome Speech <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>During the banquet, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Railway Administrations, delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, I, together with Deputy Director Wu, represent the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways in hosting a banquet for Mr. Mayers, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Bank, which is a very honorable and pleasant occasion. Everyone present probably already knows Mr. Mayers, so there is no need for a detailed introduction. Mr. Mayers came to China from England at the end of the 19th century. When he first came, he worked in the British Consulate. Later, in 1908, he was appointed as a representative of the Sino-British Bank and resigned from the consulate. He resided in China for a long time and only returned to England in 1926. Since 1927, he has served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Bank in London. Mr. Mayers is already aware that the January 28th Incident last year caused an unprecedented catastrophe for our two railways. We estimate that the total loss of assets was 3.6 million yuan, and the loss of business was 5.6 million yuan. Subsequently, the repairs and supplements, as well as the burden of renting houses due to the destruction of the Administration's offices, will total more than 10 million yuan. In addition, we have just experienced the world's great economic panic, and the passenger and freight transport of our two railways has also declined accordingly. In a few days, Mr. Mayers, if you go to our two railways to take a look, you will surely feel that this major blow still exists and cannot be restored in the short term, and it involves many places, and it cannot be restored alone. I and Deputy Director Wu were suddenly appointed by the Ministry of Railways at the end of last year and have been in office for nine months now. We are very ashamed that we have nothing to show for our achievements, but under the guidance of the Ministry of Railways and the support of the Sino-British Bank, there may be a few points that can arouse Mr. Mayers' interest. We owe a lot of principal and interest to the Sino-British Bank and are very uneasy about it, but in the past eight months of this year, we have paid more than 1.726 million yuan, and in the next few days, we can pay another 330,000 yuan. In addition, we have paid more than 476,000 yuan for the previous years' joint transportation debts of various railways, and more than 685,000 yuan for various materials debts, totaling more than 3.21 million yuan in accumulated debts. At the same time, we must know that in addition to repaying the accumulated debts, there are also various post-disaster reconstruction expenses after the January 28th Incident, which are paid from the normal income. The so-called post-disaster reconstruction includes repairing the damaged tracks, bridges, and houses. Many of the houses were completely destroyed. We think that from this, the economic credit of the two railways can be gradually established. This is one point. According to the General Affairs Office report, the salary expenses of the staff this year are expected to be reduced by 85,000 yuan, and the printing, stationery, medicines, and miscellaneous expenses are expected to be reduced by 200,000 yuan. According to the Materials Office report, the material costs were reduced by 100,000 yuan in the first half of the year, so the total reduction for the whole year can be 200,000 yuan. Although there are no statistics for other parts, it is probably possible to save money as well. Even according to what was said above, it is already close to 500,000 yuan. On the one hand, according to the Traffic Department report, the business in the past two months, although not as good as the same months in the previous year and peacetime, is already much better than the same months in the previous year after the restoration of peace. We think that from this, the economic capacity of the two railways can also be gradually restored. This is one point. In terms of all affairs, we are now investigating and researching at the same time. We want to change everything that is not perfect or satisfactory. Especially for business, we want to use automatic methods to solicit customers from all sides. The business office established on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai is an example. However, an old situation is not created in one day, and it cannot be reformed in one day. This is another point. We believe that when doing something, when it comes to economics, although there are many things to do, it always boils down to two sentences: increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Increasing revenue can make more money, but the first step is to put down a sum of capital. For example, for the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, to increase transportation capacity, double tracks should be added and Wusong Wharf should be established. For the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, to expand business, the Cao'e River to Qiantang River section must be completed, all of which require considerable funding. Reducing expenditure can save money, but sometimes you have to spend money first. For example, the Shanghai North Station now has only 14 telephones installed, which costs 1,200 yuan per month. If you set up your own switchboard, you can install 80 lines and only have 600 yuan of maintenance costs per month, which is certainly very economical, but the price of installing the switchboard is 10,000 yuan first. Also, like our current office buildings, we rent the Riverside Building, which costs nearly 6,000 yuan in rent every month, which is certainly not economical. If we can build our own, we can save a lot, but we must first raise a construction fee of several hundred thousand yuan. In this regard, we want to make more money and spend less money at the same time, but we have to spend more money first. This also requires Mr. Mayers' attention. We hope that the Sino-British Bank will provide more support in this area. Regarding the large number of staff employed by our two railways, which results in huge salary expenditures, we are often criticized by all parties. In fact, this situation has also accumulated gradually. The reason is that the number of people used in each department has never been stipulated. At present, we are doing a work, which is to review the current needs, estimate the future development, and determine the number of staff at all levels in each place, so that there can be a limit to the employment of staff in the future. There is another work, which is to adjust the talents, so that everyone can use their strengths, and if there are vacancies, they will not be filled unless absolutely necessary. Doing this gradually will definitely make the things we do and the people we use commensurate in the near future. In terms of me and Deputy Director Wu taking office, the salary expenditure of staff in various places has been reduced by about 85,000 yuan this year, which has been said above. We also want Mr. Mayers and the Sino-British Bank to pay attention to this. Mr. Mayers, this time you came to China to investigate the railways invested by the Sino-British Bank, and the first thing you saw was our Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. We hope that Mr. Mayers can give us more valuable guidance. We are very happy to see Mr. Mayers come to China from afar, so that we can have an opportunity to exchange opinions on our two railways. We respectfully propose a toast to congratulate Mr. Mayers on the success of his trip and to congratulate Mr. Mayers on his health."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Mayers' Reply <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Mayers then replied, saying in brief: "I am very grateful for the warm welcome from Director Huang and Deputy Director Wu. Now that I have had a sumptuous feast, I will not make a long speech. I will just say a few words briefly. Director Huang just said that I should come to guide, which is too polite. I firmly believe that the heads of Chinese railway administrations are mostly very capable and dedicated to their work, and they know very well what their current work is. Someone as mediocre as me, how can I have the qualifications to guide? But one thing I can say is to explain the opinions of London to the leaders in all aspects of China. I know that the Chinese railway administrators have encountered various difficulties in recent years, and most of these difficulties have occurred because they were completely unable to prevent them. However, if railway administration can be detached from political relations, most of these difficulties can be avoided. Therefore, we should be optimistic and believe that China's railways will soon be able to repay all their debts. What the British investors are happy about is the interest on their investments. According to their past experience, of the two countries in the Far East, the investment in one country is paid on time, while the other country often delays. An important part of British commerce is foreign investment. Now that commerce is depressed, most of their assets dare not be released. So I say that our Chinese friends should now establish credit, so that foreign investors will all believe that after the depression has passed, these investors will naturally come to invest continuously. Now there is not much time, and I cannot discuss Director Huang's speech point by point, but his achievements are remarkable, which is very worthy of praise. I will study his speech carefully in the next few days, and after I return to London, I will definitely tell all parties about it. Before I sit down, I respectfully raise my glass and wish Director Huang and Deputy Director Wu good health."</p>
<h3 id="e124">National Government Advisor Miller Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that Mr. Miller, advisor to the National Government, has returned to Shanghai today (20th) on the President Cleveland after a fourteen-month tour of Europe and the United States. It is said that after leaving China, he crossed the Atlantic eight times. Wherever there seemed to be a very important event happening, he would rush to it. He met with Finance Minister Song in Washington and other places. When the London Economic Conference was held, he stayed in London for six weeks and lingered in Geneva for some time. Three-fifths of his time after leaving China was spent in Europe. The first thing he should do after arriving in China is to examine recent events and observe the current situation. Although he is often in close contact with political circles, he has been away from China for a long time and still feels a sense of distance. According to reports, Mr. Miller is quite famous in European and American journalism. He founded Miller's Review of the Far East and The China Weekly Review and has written several books. There are quite a few foreigners serving as advisors to various departments of the National Government, but he is the only one who serves as an advisor to the entire government.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Replied by Telegram - Jiangsu Provincial Government Replied to the Telegrams from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Local Coordination Association, saying: Received and reviewed the two telegrams from Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Local Coordination Association. It has been verified that the Baotai seawall is in danger, and Zhang Junsheng, a technician from the Construction Department, has been dispatched to conduct an on-site survey. As for the emergency repair funds required, the government's committee has decided to approve the advance payment by Baotai and Jiaxing counties for official expenditure, and has instructed the county chiefs to comply. Please be informed, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of Jiangsu Provincial Government, Dong Xiujia, Director of Construction Department, stamped seal.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Tang Wenzhi's Telegram: A Fierce Hurricane Struck on the Evening of the 18th <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Devastatingly, over seventy yards of the Liuhekou and Nanwangjia wharves, which were under urgent repair, and over sixty yards of the Yuebingtai and over ten yards of the main wharf project were completely washed away. More than four thousand sandbags were swept away, and dozens of wooden piles were broken. All efforts were in vain. The remaining height of the embankment surface varies from one, two, to three feet. At Wangjiazhai, a breach of more than five yards occurred, destroying several houses. At the north end of the Liuhekou North Taoist Temple, a breach of more than nine yards occurred, flooding several miles and submerging all fields and houses. More than ten yards of the earthen embankment were also destroyed, along with the concrete and stone workers. In addition, at the south end of the new project at Fangjia Yan, about fifteen yards of earthen embankment collapsed, and over one yard of the wide stone beach slope was completely destroyed. Furthermore, the stone beach slope below the cement foundation completely collapsed, and four sections of the embankment surface were washed away, each four to five yards long and over one yard wide. Moreover, at the north end of the new project, a total of over forty yards long and over two yards wide were destroyed at two locations, north and south. Over sixty yards of the stone beach below were washed away. In addition, north of the water arrow, over twenty yards of earthen embankment were washed away, with the remaining embankment surface only two or three feet high, on the verge of collapse, a very critical situation. In addition to the seawall technology patrol inspectors, Zhang and Zhu, telegraphing the Taicang County Magistrate Hong, the Seawall Protection Committee held an emergency meeting yesterday, and Tang Wenzhi telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting the urgent allocation of large funds for emergency repairs and to plan for long-term solutions. The draft of the telegram is recorded as follows: To Gu, Chairman, and Shu, Director, of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government. On the evening of Qiao, a hurricane caused two hazardous situations on the Taicang dike. The situation is particularly serious. We implore you to quickly allocate large funds for emergency repairs and to plan for long-term solutions. (Signed) Tang Wenzhi, Taicang Seawall Protection Committee. Ge.</p>
<p>Shen Bureau Chief's Remarks: Both the east and west seawalls were reported to be in danger during the two hurricanes this month. Yesterday, according to remarks from Shen, Bureau Chief of the Municipal Works Bureau, the East Seawall of this city (located in Gaoqiao, Pudong), on the shores of the East China Sea, is over fifteen kilometers long. Most of it is an earthen seawall. Because the mud is easily eroded by tides and waves, protective engineering is selectively constructed. Although this construction can protect the seawall during normal high tides, it is still difficult to avoid overflow and breaches during abnormal typhoons and storm surges, such as the typhoon twenty years ago and this year's hurricane. Although repairs were made after the dangerous situation during the storm surge twenty years ago, due to limited funding, most of the projects were of a superficial nature, resulting in weak areas throughout the seawall. Therefore, it is to be expected that it cannot withstand the impact of typhoons and storm surges. On the 2nd of this month, the first hurricane struck, although not as severe as the one twenty years ago. However, the wind direction twenty years ago directly battered the seawall, and except for the top section being damaged, the rest was fortunately unharmed. This year's wind force, however, eroded along the seawall, and the entire seawall was attacked, so the degree of damage and danger is actually greater than twenty years ago. After the hazardous situation, the bureau reported to the municipal government for an allocation of 50,000 yuan, and workers were immediately dispatched to make every effort to plug the breaches. The remaining damaged earthen seawalls will be urgently repaired by separately hiring workers. If there were no secondary hurricane, some of it could have been repaired. As for the damage to the West Seawall (in Wusong), it is far less serious than that of the East Seawall. However, since the stone seawall there was destroyed in many places by Japanese naval gunfire during the January 28th Incident, it has not been thoroughly repaired, resulting in several places collapsing during the storm surge on the 2nd of this month. Among them, one place at Wu Mufeng had a breach of fourteen or five feet, which was more dangerous. The bureau dispatched seventy or eighty regular workers the night before this storm surge, using sandbags to plug it, but after the storm surge on the 18th, it was washed away again. Yesterday, the bureau again transported a large amount of sandbags for emergency repairs, and municipal committee members in the area hired many local laborers and mud workers to cooperate in the repair. At the same time, a special commissioner was dispatched to Songhu to supervise, in order to ensure thoroughness. In short, the first step for the current construction steps for the East and West Seawalls is to plug the breaches. The 50,000 yuan allocated by the municipal government will be used immediately, and it is expected that the emergency construction will be completed in the near future. The second step is the proper construction, which requires a substantial amount of money, and a plan is currently being drafted.</p>
<p>Gaoqiao Citizens' Telegram: Xie Bingheng and other citizens of Gaoqiao submitted a document to the Municipal Government: To Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai. The Gaoqiao Seawall has been in disrepair for years and is extremely dilapidated. Last autumn, there were dangerous situations during the flood season, and we repeatedly appealed to the government for emergency repairs, but they were not completely solidified. On September 2nd of this year, the first hurricane suddenly caused more than ten breaches, and the angry tide rushed in, causing widespread flooding. Even the strong stone seawall suffered collapses. We have flown reports to the government through the local associations, requesting urgent repairs, but after many days, no news has been received. Unexpectedly, yesterday a second hurricane came again, with surging sea waves and a dark sky. Its momentum was fierce, far exceeding the first time. The Gaoqiao seawall was fundamentally shaken by the first devastation. It has not been repaired, and has suffered another attack. In one night, dozens of breaches occurred. The torrent rushed down, and the houses were all in ruins. A bit of fertile land has turned into a vast sea. Residents were terrified in the middle of the night, not knowing where to escape. Above, torrential rain stripped their souls, and below, huge waves crashed against the sky. Cries of pain and anguish echoed, with nowhere to turn. The misery is so extreme that we cannot bear to describe it fully. We believe that if trickles are not stopped, they will become rivers. The dangerous seawall, which has been dilapidated for years, has suffered repeated disasters from wind and waves. Sitting idly by and not saving it will eventually lead to a major disaster. The people of the coastal area live within the territory and are subject to the government. A great government does not abandon even the smallest. Therefore, we urgently report the disaster, begging for our lives. We respectfully implore you to be mindful of these people and immediately carry out emergency repairs, so that those who are displaced can have a temporary place to live and not be exposed in the water country, living as neighbors to fish and turtles. This is our only hope. As we urgently send this telegram, we await your orders. Xie Bingheng, Ma Boshen, Huang Luzhan, Huang Shixi, Yang Yunming, Zhang Baikuai, Ling Zihe, Shen Yi Liu, Cai Ruchuan, Yin Shijie, etc. bow. Ge.</p>
<p>Qin Chengqing Dismissed: According to Xin Sheng She, the seawall embankment project in Wusong is still being repaired yesterday. Because the wind has subsided, the work is easier. Therefore, the repair projects along the seawall, such as at Tanjia Bang, Yang Wharf, and Shuchuan Wharf, have been mostly completed. However, the most important Wu Mufeng embankment was washed away by more than twenty feet during the heavy wind and rain the other day. After the Wusong District Municipal Committee hired workers to make every effort to repair it, Qin Chengqing, who was appointed by the Works Bureau on the 17th to supervise the emergency repairs in Songhu, only arrived on the 19th, causing the embankment to collapse and a dangerous situation to arise. After this matter was learned by Shen Yi, the Director of the Works Bureau, he dismissed the member due to the member's ineffective performance, delayed important public affairs, and immediately appointed a special commissioner to lead earthworkers to Songhu, together with the earthworkers hired by the municipal committee, to cooperate in the emergency repairs. As of yesterday afternoon, more than a dozen feet have been repaired. The remaining part of the project should be completed in the next few days. As for the seawall embankments along the northwest gates of Baoshan County, they were all repaired yesterday. According to personnel from the Wusong District Municipal Committee Office, the third day of the eighth lunar month is the time when the tide is most turbulent. The embankments along the seawall must be repaired before the deadline in order to escape the dangerous period. Otherwise, there is concern for future troubles, and there is still a risk of the embankments collapsing, and so forth.</p>

<p>Sea Routes Open: The sea routes of the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the Shanghai-Taiwan line, and the North and South Ocean lines all resumed normal operation yesterday. Those that had been sheltering from the wind outside the Wusong estuary have all sailed. The postal ship of the Great Britain Company also loaded cargo and left Shanghai. The Hexing Wheel of Zhaoxing came to Shanghai from Guangzhou. It encountered a strong wind on the way. Fortunately, the wind momentarily surged past the ship, so although it encountered danger, it was quickly safe. It can arrive tomorrow. The Sanbei Wanxiang Wheel, which was sheltering from the wind in Yangshan, and the China Merchants Yushun Yuanan, etc., also telegraphed that they were safe and sound. They can all arrive in Shanghai today. The Kanhua Wheel of Changxing encountered a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean on the 17th, damaging the hull and injuring six sailors. It returned to Yokohama, Japan, for repairs. Yesterday, a telegram was received reporting that the repairs have been completed and it has set sail. The schedule will not be delayed.</p>
<p>Songhu Train Operates: The Songhu train could not reach Baotai Wan for two days. Now that the tide at Zhanghuabang has receded and the railway bridge over Yunzaobang has been urgently repaired by the railway bureau, the work has also been completed. Since 9:30 yesterday morning, the Songhu train has been operating normally, directly reaching Baotai Wan.</p>
<p>Telephone Lines Repaired: The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications suffered heavy losses to all South City and Zhabei lines due to the hurricane on the 2nd of this month. It took two days and nights of urgent repairs to restore them. On the 18th, it was struck by another hurricane. According to Bureau Chief Xu yesterday, the losses this time were even heavier than the previous time. It is estimated that about 400 households in the South City district and about 100 households in the Zhabei district were affected. Especially in the Pudong and Longhua areas, many wooden poles were knocked down. This is because all the trunk lines in the Pudong district are old and dilapidated ones formerly owned by the Shanghai Telephone Company. Therefore, they were often broken by hurricanes. New poles have now been erected, and preparations are being made to establish a branch bureau. Moreover, the bureau's jurisdiction is vast, and places such as Wusong and Pudong are quite far from the bureau, so all the workers feel that they are not sufficient to be dispatched in emergencies. Due to the above-mentioned difficulties, there was a slight delay. Yesterday morning, a worker from the bureau, Huang Jintao, touched a power line while urgently repairing the lines at Xiaoximen, resulting in an accident that caused his death. The long-distance international radio station lines were also damaged. Workers are now being dispatched day and night to urgently repair them, and they have been gradually restored. It is expected that they will be completely repaired tomorrow.</p>
<p>Fishermen and Merchants Suffer Losses: According to the Central News Agency, according to news from the fishing and merchant circles in this city, the Xiangshan Port waters of Zhejiang suffered severe damage from the typhoon. Fishing boats there did not know that the hurricane was coming in advance, so they did not have time to take precautions. About forty boats capsized, with very heavy losses. The number of deaths is probably not small, but there is currently no confirmed information. As for the disaster situation in the fishing areas of Zhapu and Shenjiamen Bay, no reports have been received yet.</p>

<p>A letter requesting assistance from the Jilin Headquarters</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association received a letter yesterday from Zhang Jidong, a representative of Song Guorong, the commander of the Provisional Second Army of the Jilin Volunteer Army, who came from Beiping, appealing for assistance. The association immediately replied with a letter, and at the same time sent a letter to the General Headquarters of the Jilin Volunteer Army requesting a modification of assistance and other matters. Excerpts from the three letters are separately recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Letter from Zhang Jidong <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, our army, since August last year, was ordered by President Zhu of the Yuanji Relief Association to appoint Song Guorong as the commander of the Eighth Route of the Northeast Volunteer Army (defense area: Panshi, Yitong, Shuangyang, Huadian, Changchun, Jilin), and held a swearing-in ceremony on August 9 in Heishi Town, Panshi County. Within a few days, it captured Panshi, Yitong, Shuangyang, Huadian, and other counties in succession. More than 40,000 people came to join us, with complete firearms and horses, and the momentum was huge, shaking the puppet capital. The Japanese and Manchukuo armies, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately mobilized a large force to suppress us. After more than ten days and more than twenty bloody battles, both sides suffered casualties. Later, due to a lack of ammunition, thin clothing for the soldiers, and no food, it was difficult to support them in the severe winter. Wounded soldiers also had no medicine or coffins. Therefore, the troops were reorganized into smaller units and worked separately. Our commander disguised himself and came to Beiping to seek assistance. General Zhu provided him with 15,000 yuan of current currency, promising continued assistance in the future. Commander Qi returned to the General Headquarters of Jilin in March of this year and served as the commander of the Second Army. He convened a meeting of anti-Japanese generals to reorganize. Seeing that the large gathering of troops in the past created a large target for the enemy and the work was small, this time, the troops were reorganized into smaller units, taking guerrilla tactics and implementing a joint defense system to help each other. The commander and cadres patrolled the defense area every week, issuing orders at any time and place, and gathering officers and soldiers to give speeches on the great righteousness of saving the country. Therefore, this year's work is incomparable to the past. This is the effect of having a small target. The detailed situation of the work has been reported to the General Headquarters of the Jilin Volunteer Army and forwarded to your association for the record. However, it is a pity that the work has lasted for seven months and has not received any assistance from any party. In a blink of an eye, the weather is cold, and the soldiers are thinly clothed and lacking food. This is the biggest problem. The former Jilin Headquarters pleaded for assistance for our army, and your association also sympathized with the hardships of the officers and soldiers and ordered the Jilin General Headquarters to appropriate funds from the remaining items of the 20,000 yuan agitation fee. After the representative learned of this, he immediately negotiated with the department. It said that there were only a few remaining, and the representative could do nothing. Now the soldiers are hoping for assistance, like clouds in a great drought. Therefore, I have described the general outline of the work and the difficulties currently felt. I want to disband the troops locally, but I am reluctant to abandon the good weapons to others, and there is no place for the patriotic athletes to return to. I want to continue the work, but I regret that there is no spiritual or material assistance, resulting in a dilemma. I sincerely ask you to sympathize with the tens of thousands of patriotic athletes and their officers and relatives, who are all in deep water, and do everything possible to provide assistance to solve the current difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Reply from the Relief Association <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, I have received your letter of September 14 and learned everything. Your army is loyal and courageous, resisting the Japanese Kou for the country, sacrificing and fighting, winning glory for the nation, and enduring hunger and cold, preserving strength for the country. I deeply admire all of these experiences. However, our association has already allocated the donations raised to various departments, and there are no remaining reserves. Recently, the relationship between investigating the national salvation donations has further interrupted the source of donations. I feel ashamed for the Guanwai athletes. A few days ago, Xiao Xiange, the standing committee member of the Jilin General Headquarters, came to Shanghai and met with him. According to him, the funds stored in the General Headquarters are quite different from what is stated in the letter. However, the department decided that the previously stored funds would be used exclusively for agitation fees and not for assistance. The above is the reason for the letter. I will now forward it to the department for appropriate accommodation, and I still ask you to contact the department directly to benefit the military. This is a special reply. I hope you will check and understand.</p>

<p>Respectfully, according to the letter of September 14 from Zhang Jidong, the representative of Song Guorong, the commander of the Provisional Second Army of the Jilin Volunteer Army (the original text is omitted above). According to this, our association has already allocated the donations raised to various departments, and there are no remaining reserves. Recently, the relationship between investigating the national salvation donations has further interrupted the source of donations. A few days ago, Xiao Xiange, a member of your department, came to Shanghai on official business and met with him. He learned that the funds previously allocated were decided to be used exclusively for agitation fees and not for assistance. There are still many remaining funds at present. If the army is indeed making achievements in battle and is in a difficult situation, it seems that appropriate changes should be made and a little assistance should be provided to show encouragement. This has been decided by the Standing Committee of our association, requesting your department to investigate and handle it appropriately, and reply to Mr. Zhang, who will go directly to the front for contact on file. In addition to the reply, I hereby send a special letter for your reference.</p>

<p>The representatives have already returned to Shanghai yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai organizations who welcomed the heroes of the anti-Japanese war back to China previously sent representatives Ye Jiaxing, Wang Honghui, Sun Mingqi, etc. to Su恭 to present General Su Bingwen with a satin flag and a gold medal. The flag-awarding and medal-presenting ceremony was held in Su on the 19th. The ceremony was very grand, and the details have been reported in the previous report. The representatives have already returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to them, Su's residence is very narrow and the furnishings are quite simple, but he is always thinking about the anti-Japanese war. Yesterday, he also sent a letter of thanks to various organizations, which was brought back by the representatives. The original text is recorded as follows: Respectfully, the Northeast has fallen and the rivers and mountains are broken. Bingwen is a soldier and is responsible for defending the territory. He led armed comrades to attack the puppet state and resist the violent Japan. He fought in the border areas and was trapped by bullets. He reluctantly withdrew and returned after many twists and turns. His long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, and he is deeply ashamed. On the day of arriving in Shanghai, I was honored to be warmly welcomed by all circles, and I was deeply moved by the grand intentions and feelings. Now, Wang Honghui, Ye Jiaxing, Sun Mingqi, and Wang Hesong came from afar to Su to award flags and medals. The ceremony was elaborate and the dignity was increased. I am surprised and even more frightened. In addition to gratitude, I can only swear to adhere to my original intention and continue to work hard, to live up to the earnest expectations of all circles. I am sending this special thank you and wish you all the best.</p>

<p>Member of the Central Committee Wu Chaochu went to Qingdao to escape the heat and has now returned to Shanghai by the Pu'an Wheel. The reporter of Xin Sheng She met Wu yesterday, and Wu stated that the reports that the government would send him to Guangdong were not true. He plans to rest in Shanghai for a while and will travel through the provinces of Fujian, Yunnan, and Guizhou when he has the opportunity. Although Guangdong is close to Fujian, Yunnan, and Guizhou, he has never been there. As for the recent diplomatic situation, he has not had time to study it, so he has no opinions to express. However, his position is definitely not to change it lightly.</p>

<p>The Tea Association also Issued a Letter of Certification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce announced to the Xin Sheng She a telegram from the President of the Moscow Soviet Russian Aid Association and a letter from the Foreign Tea Trade Association. The original texts are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Moscow Translated as follows: To the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, there is a man named Morrison, who is a former employee of the Shanghai branch of the Soviet Russian Aid Association and is acquainted with people under the White Russian regime. He is now taking hostile actions against Soviet Russia, providing errands for those who are trying to undermine the commercial relations between the Aid Association and the Chinese business and financial circles. The efforts of the Soviet Russian Aid Association in China for ten years have proved that commercial relations under Sino-Russian cooperation are beneficial to both parties. I firmly believe that this attempt to damage the reputation of the Soviet Russian Aid Association and undermine the work of the Aid Association in China will not be approved by your country's business community. Chairman of the Soviet Russian Aid Association, Chai Nenski</p>
<p>Letter from the Foreign Tea Trade Association Respectfully, I received a telegram from the Russian Aid Association yesterday, translated as follows: (The original telegram is the same as above) The Aid Association has indeed been purchasing Chinese tea in Shanghai, Hankou, and Fujian for ten years. The transactions are fair. In the years with the highest tea purchases, there were 17 to 18 million yuan. In the years with the lowest, there were still 4 to 5 million yuan. The tea payments are clear every time, and there is never any debt. The credit is well-known. I am hereby writing to your association to investigate and announce, so as not to hinder Sino-Russian commercial progress.</p>

<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association obtained news of the Yellow River breach and immediately dispatched a special commissioner to conduct an on-site investigation to carry out relief efforts. The report of the commissioner's investigation of the disaster situation in Jining, Jiaxiang, Juye, and Dan City counties in Shandong after first inspecting the disaster situation in Henan Province is recorded below: Jining County has the largest area and the busiest streets. Considering the county's farmland, less than three-tenths of it was flooded. After passing the Shunxiang River Road, the water is still one or two feet deep. Nearby farmland, yellow beans, and late wheat are all submerged and unharvested. The Xintao River, 20 miles outside the South Gate, was flooded by about 200 hectares. In the seventh district, there is a vast expanse of water, and the water has not receded to two or three feet. There are too many village names to record in detail. Jiaxiang County has the smallest area, but there are many mountains and plains. Two-thirds of the autumn crops planted were flooded. In Dongguan Township, 600 mu of farmland were completely flooded, and more than 1,000 households were affected. 5,000 disaster victims are awaiting relief, and no one has provided relief yet. Juye County has a slightly larger area than Jiaxiang, and one-third of the autumn grain planted was submerged. After passing the Pig Water River, it was witnessed that the inside of the embankments on both sides was still a vast expanse of water. (Dan City County) has an even larger area than Juye. The water marks in various places are as deep as six feet, and the water has not receded to six or seven inches. There is no harvest.

At the same time, the Shanghai-based office was also abolished, and the Military and Political Department Ordnance Department Shanghai Factory Custody Office was established.</p>
<p>Selection of Director: After receiving the order, the Shanghai-based office immediately followed instructions to close the office and abolish its title. At the same time, the Military and Political Department Ordnance Department appointed Mr. Li Chengxu, the former director of the factory's pharmaceutical plant, as the director of the custody office, and also appointed eleven custodians to manage the objects in various sections. The office was established in the original Gaochang Temple Ordnance Factory, and yesterday began operating according to the new organization.</p>
<p>All Staff: According to custodian Yan Xianguang, who spoke to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday, the eleven custodians have now been assigned by Director Li to manage various sections, including military equipment (Kang Wangfeng Han), material warehouse (Wang Qiliang, Huang Rongchang), and documents (assigned to Yu).

<p>The Xingxiang Cotton Weaving Factory at 210 Wuding Road suddenly received a warning letter from the Public Concession Board yesterday. The translation reads: "To the Manager of Xingxiang Cotton Weaving Factory: There are several undesirable aspects of your factory that require serious attention. The wooden fence, lead-skinned building, and mezzanine have not been approved by the Public Concession Board. This type of construction is not suitable for a factory where workers work, according to the Public Concession Board. The emergency exit from top to bottom is also not very safe. In the event of a fire, there will certainly be loss of life and property. This type of construction should be relocated or find a vacant lot for workers to work. The door must open outwards, and machinery should not block the emergency exit. Also, provide more boxes to place other items and clean the corridors. Only then can the Public Concession Board allow the factory to be opened in this building. Unless each part is improved, it is best to obtain permission from the Works Department. How to proceed to comply with building regulations and ensure worker safety? Otherwise, if you do not comply with the requirements of the Public Concession Board, the Public Concession Board will exercise its power to protect public safety," etc. It is reported that the Machine Industry Association will petition the Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate according to law.</p>

This has already been ordered and filed. Now, according to a report from the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, based on a report from the Beijing Municipal Federation of Factories, for the re-registration of existing companies, how should the legally required documents, such as the inspection certificate from the competent authority, the investigation report from directors, supervisors, and committee members, and the resolution record of the establishment meeting, be supplemented? We propose to specially order a method to be forwarded to the Ministry for review and instructions. After investigating that existing companies have all been established for many years, and were not handled in accordance with the Company Law at the time of their original establishment, the currently prepared registration documents cannot be in accordance with the law. Now, in order to comply with the facts and the law, we have specially ordered four articles of methods for supplementing the registration documents of existing companies, and a copy is enclosed for your compliance and forwarding to all company members for their information. This order includes the following methods: (1) If the shares of an existing company are fully subscribed by the promoters, they should supplement the request to the competent authority for inspection in accordance with the law and issue an inspection certificate. (2) If the shares of an existing company are not fully subscribed by the promoters, the current directors and supervisors should conduct a re-investigation and issue a report, requesting the shareholders' meeting to approve it. (3) The resolution record of the establishment meeting can be replaced by the resolution record of the shareholders' meeting that recently amended the articles of association, the resolution record of the shareholders' meeting that elected the current directors and supervisors, and the resolution record of the shareholders' meeting that approved the investigation report of the directors and supervisors in the preceding article. (4) In order to complete the procedures in the first and second articles, if an existing company cannot supplement the request for registration within the time limit, it may state the reasons within the time limit and formally apply for registration after the time limit, but the time must be declared in advance and approved by the Ministry of Industry."</p>

There were also 5 dou 8 sheng 4 he of leftover rice, which were also distributed together. Although the disaster victims were slightly relieved, they were hit by hurricanes and torrential rains again the day before yesterday, and the disaster situation in various places is even worse. How can we have the magic touch to save these millions of compatriots waiting to die?</p>
<h3 id="e158">Tobacco and Alcohol Industries Request Amendment of New Regulations, Ministry Rejects <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai, Ningbo, and Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industries Joint Association had previously submitted opinions on the obstacles in the new regulations on local tobacco and alcohol taxes, requesting the Ministry of Finance to amend them. Yesterday, they received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating: "The summary and memorandum have been noted. After careful review of the memorandum and the documents submitted by the Taxation Department regarding the association's repeated submissions and telegrams, regarding the new regulations on local tobacco and alcohol, either due to misinterpretation of the provisions, causing misunderstandings, or advocating the maintenance of bad habits, being used by others. For example, the new regulations set fixed-amount taxes and measure-based rates, each with a fixed procedure, so that merchants know the exact amount they should pay, and officials have no way to collect excessive or harsh taxes, which was originally intended to protect the interests of merchants and people, but the merchants hold different opinions and make accusations. What is their intention? It should be known that the commercial monopolies that have been maintained over the years, with layer upon layer of corruption, have been criticized by the world. The Minister is determined to eliminate this in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. However, the summary still considers the old system to be convenient, as if deeply regretting its abolition. Why are the likes and dislikes so different? Also, there is much haggling over the penalties. I don't know that the penalties are specifically for those who conceal or omit. If the merchants are engaged in legitimate business and ask themselves if they have no other intentions, why worry about being strict? The containers for local alcohol are too complicated. If the alcohol merchants can set uniform standards themselves, the standards can be assessed according to the containers. As for the meaning of unified taxation, the association's submission is not yet fully understood. Unified taxation means that one tax is levied on one item and no re-taxation is levied, which has nothing to do with whether there is a factory or not. The fixed-amount tax on local alcohol this time is based on provinces, which is different from the nature of unified taxation. Whether to change to unified taxation in the future or set other methods is something that the Ministry will consider on its own. There is no need for the association to plan in advance. As for the selection of bureau personnel, the Ministry has always taken the principle of using people according to their talents. If there are those who do not abide by the regulations and take the opportunity to extort, those merchants can first file a factual complaint with the provincial bureau, and there is also the Taxation Department and the Ministry to which they can appeal, and it is not difficult to deal with them impartially. There is no need to worry too much. Moreover, the reform of the tax system has just been established and the regulations have not yet been announced. If there are any objections, and the association is established at this time, as if it has a preconceived opinion, the Minister has reviewed the entire file. The Taxation Department has already reviewed and replied separately to the reasons and requests for improvement submitted directly by the various industry associations, such as the commutation of methods for supplementary tax payment for inventory and tax refunds, the order of local alcohol tax payment, the length of the transportation and change of transportation periods, the procedures for calculating taxes on foreign cigarettes, and the regulations for various tax refunds on local tobacco. The merchants of each industry should be able to understand this and implement it conscientiously. If, after operating in accordance with the new regulations, difficulties are found in the procedures after a considerable period of time, those merchants can submit the facts to the Taxation Department for review and handling, provided that they do not conflict with the principles. However, they must not make empty demands, nor should they use the cessation of brewing and transportation as a tool for obstruction and sabotage, as submitted in the summary. If they dare to violate this, they will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law to emphasize tax administration. Do not say that you were not warned. This reply."</p>

<p>Shanghai Banking Circles Have Difficulty Lending, Chinese-Russian Tea Merchants Begin Trading</p>
<p>Tea is a major export of our country. However, in recent years, due to adhering to outdated methods and poor roasting, it has been affected by the dumping of Indian, Ceylonese, and Japanese tea. Chinese tea has plummeted in the international market. Tea merchants have suffered heavy losses due to excessive stockpiling. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry convened meetings of various tea merchants to discuss, and agreed on rescue and improvement methods, and submitted them to the Ministry of Industry for adoption and implementation. The annual amount of Chinese tea sold to Russia is quite large. However, Russian merchants have traditionally not traded in cash when purchasing Chinese tea, and it takes a year before the money is paid in full. However, Chinese tea merchants have been unable to lend money due to poor business and economic difficulties in recent years, so the sale of Chinese tea to Russia has been suspended in an invisible way. Various export tea merchants have submitted requests to the International Trade Bureau to forward them to the Ministry of Industry for assistance. After further consultation between the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, it was decided that the Ministries of Finance and Industry, together with the tea merchants, would contact the banking circles in Shanghai to negotiate loan methods. A reporter from New News Agency learned from the Trade Bureau yesterday that this matter has been properly discussed by the Ministries of Finance and Industry, tea merchants, and banking circles in Shanghai, and the methods have been decided, as follows: (1) After the tea trade between China and Russia is concluded, Russian merchants will be allowed one year to repay the money, and the money will be advanced by the banking circles. (2) After one year, the Russian merchants will repay the principal and interest in full to the bank that advanced the money. The above two methods have already been agreed upon by the banking circles. The Shanghai Russian Merchants Association has already started handling the shipment of goods for sale in Russia.</p>

<p>丨Two Round Routes Operate Simultaneously丨</p>
<p>The new tram route from Heping Road to Nanyang Bridge built by the Chinese Merchant Electric Company has been officially opened since yesterday morning. At the same time, the Second Route from Laoximen to Xuejiabang has been changed to the Second Round Route, divided into red and black signs. Those with red signs run from Nanyang Bridge, Xiaoximen, Difangting, Hujunying, Xuejiabang, Xiaodongmen, Xiaonanmen, back to Nanyang Bridge. Those with black signs run from Nanyang Bridge, Xiaoximen, Xiaonanmen, Xiaodongmen, Xuejiabang, Hujunying, Difangting, back to Nanyang Bridge. The company has posted detailed methods on each car since the night before last, and has also posted announcements at major stations to inform passengers. As for the Fourth Route from Laoximen to Gaochangmiao, it has been running on the new route since yesterday, avoiding the trouble of turning around in Laoximen. The Second Round Route and Fourth Route on the new route all run from Laoximen to Fangbang Bridge, turn into Zhaozhou Road, then turn to Heping Road to Laoximen. The road surface of the new route is all made of cement, so it is very strong.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Our Country's Rice and Wheat Markets <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Are Almost Completely Manipulated by Foreign Goods, Large Quantities Imported Annually, Various Parties Request Import Tariffs</p>
<p>Our country is an agricultural country, and the rice and wheat produced in various provinces are sufficient to be self-sufficient and have a surplus. However, in recent years, the rural economy of the whole country has gone bankrupt. The reason for this is that although it is caused by frequent natural disasters and man-made disasters in successive years, the dumping of foreign rice and foreign wheat is the main reason. The chairmen of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan provinces, as well as the National General Chamber of Commerce, have successively telegraphed the government, requesting the imposition of import tariffs on foreign rice in order to save the sales of domestic grain and restore the rural economy. The Ministry of Finance is now carefully considering this matter, and concrete measures will be decided soon. The reporter from New News Agency believed that this matter is related to the entire economic problem of our country, so he went to the International Trade Bureau and the Jianghai Customs to investigate the dumping of foreign rice and wheat and the quantities, as well as the detailed impact on our country. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Foreign Rice Floods the Market <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Our country's rice production can originally be self-sufficient. If there is a bumper harvest, there is still a surplus. However, in recent years, due to the dumping of foreign rice, the sales of Chinese rice have been sluggish. This year's autumn harvest is abundant, but foreign rice is still continuously imported and floods the market, selling at low prices. The quantity of imports has increased sharply year by year. Last year's imports were 22,486,639 dan, a sharp increase of more than double compared to the previous year's 10,740,810 dan, with a value of 100 million gold units. Although there are no statistics for this year yet, the import quantity will still exceed last year's statistics. Domestic rice merchants have suffered heavy losses due to stockpiling. Although the disaster situation in various places is widespread this year, rice production has not been severely affected, so the harvests are very abundant. If foreign rice is allowed to be imported and dumped continuously, it will directly threaten our country's rice market, and indirectly affect the bankruptcy of the rural economy.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Foreign Wheat Dumping <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Our country's wheat has also been declining sharply in recent years. The reason for this is not that domestic wheat production is too abundant, but that most factories in our country use foreign wheat, and foreign goods are all surplus products from their own countries, dumped in our country, with prices falling sharply. Chinese wheat has also declined accordingly, so the wheat market is completely manipulated by foreign wheat. This year's domestic wheat production is also very abundant, but surplus wheat from foreign countries is still imported continuously, causing wheat in various parts of our country to be stockpiled and unsalable.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Rice and Wheat Statistics <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs survey, the statistics of foreign wheat imports last year are as follows: A. Foreign rice imports: (1) More than 7.5 million dan from Annam, worth more than 34 million gold units; (2) More than 7.16 million dan from British India, worth more than 30.8 million gold units; (3) More than 6.4 million dan from Siam, worth more than 29 million gold units; (4) More than 1.1 million dan from Hong Kong, worth more than 5.5 million gold units; (5) A total of more than 22.4 million dan from other countries, worth more than 100 million gold units. B. Wheat imports: (1) More than 9.2 million dan from Australia, worth 30 million gold units; (2) More than 2.9 million dan from the United States, worth 7 million gold units; (3) More than 2.7 million dan from Canada, worth 7 million gold units; (4) A total of more than 15 million dan from other countries, worth more than 43 million gold units.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Continued Hearing of the False Military Officer Case <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>In Bo Hong claims that when he was a secretary under Cui Jie, a subordinate of Zhu Fohai, he received two small silver dollars a day.</p>
<p>In Bo Hong, from Shandong, and Dong Shu Jin, from Anhui, recently established a "Fifth Route Army Headquarters of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Office" in Room 39, Huadong Apartment, Malan Road, in the French Concession. They also set up a communications office at No. 22, Shixing Lane, Caishi Street, indiscriminately issuing letters of appointment and defrauding people of money. Zhao Zibo, a detective from the political department of the French Concession police, discovered this and rushed to the two locations on the morning of the 9th of this month. He arrested In, Dong, and seven others, including Zhou Bingrong (aide-de-camp to the councilor), Cui Jie, Teng Ganchen, Lü Hanwen, and Wang Peide. Various pieces of evidence, such as letters of appointment, documents, and military uniforms, were seized. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution, interrogation, and investigation. This case has been reported in this newspaper twice. The police have completed their investigation, and yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Xiong Hui continued the hearing in the Criminal Court No. 1. First, Fei Xizhen, a lawyer representing the police, presented the police's investigation process and submitted various exhibits. Then, Gong Pi Jizong, Yue Dingchen, and Qian Rongfeng described in detail how they were defrauded of money and appointed to positions. When interrogated, In Bo Hong stated, "When Bai Chongxi was the Commander of the Songhu Garrison, I served as the captain of a special task force, and then followed him to Hankou. I returned home due to illness. After the Northeast Wanbaoshan Incident, I went to Beiping and joined the Volunteer Army under Zhu Fohai, serving as a councilor. Zhu was the commander of the independent 74th Brigade under Zhang Zuolin, stationed in Rehe. I also fought in Zunhua, Yangou, and Xifengkou. In April of last year, Zhu appointed me as the commander of the Fifth Route Army. The letter of appointment was issued in July of this year. I had 1,560 men under my command, and I am currently working with Zhu in Yanqing. Zhu ordered me to come to Shanghai to set up a communications office for the Northeast Volunteer Army to connect with charities and arrange relief efforts. The communications office was located at No. 22 Baoxing Lane. Dong Shujin and I issued 15 letters of appointment, including eight councilor positions and seven aide-de-camp positions, without taking any money. Dong's position as deputy commander was also appointed by Zhu Fohai. Cui Jie was my secretary, Zhou Bingrong was a soldier, and Wang Peide was the chief of the aide-de-camp office. I do not know Teng and Lü." Dong Shujin stated, "I met In in Nanjing last year. In mid-July of this year, I met In at the Deyilou Restaurant in the City God Temple. He said he came to Shanghai from Beiping to reorganize the Volunteer Army and was waiting for orders from the central government. He told me he was staying at the Donghua Apartment, so I went to see him every day. On August 7th, he appointed me as deputy commander and gave me a letter of appointment, which I have lost. I do not know Zhu Fohai. In always met with people at No. 22 Baoxing Lane. The evidence found in my home was given to me by In for safekeeping. All the letters of appointment were purchased by him from the Gaosheng Company on the Avenue Edward VII." Cui Jie stated, "I knew In when I was a secretary at the 19th Route Army rear hospital. In June of this year, I learned that In had been promoted to commander, so I went to the Huadong Apartment to find In to seek employment. He appointed me as secretary and gave me two silver dollars a day." Zhou Bingrong stated that he served as a soldier at In's place. Wang Peide stated that he served as a messenger in In's aide-de-camp office. Teng Ganchen stated that he was the captain of the fourth team in the 19th Route Army engineering team. Last year, he came to Shanghai and sought employment with Zhang Zhihui, who claimed to be the independent brigade commander of the Taihu Bandit Suppression. Zhang agreed to appoint him as deputy brigade commander. In September, he was arrested by the Public Security Bureau in Ximen for impersonating a military officer and sentenced to six months in prison by the local court. He was released in April of this year and went home. Later, he went to Henan to look for work but was unsuccessful. He transferred to Nanjing. On the 8th of this month, he met a friend, Liu Ronghui, on Avenue Joffre, who said he was currently an aide-de-camp in the Fifth Route Army. He invited me to talk at the Huadong Apartment. I went the next day and was arrested. Lü Hanwen stated that on the 8th of this month, he met Wang Peide on Xinxinqiao Street. Wang said he was working at a lawyer's office at No. 22 Baoxing Lane and invited me to talk. I went on the morning of the 9th and was arrested. At this point, the court announced that it would adjourn and reconvene at a later date. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Japanese Forging Chinese Banknotes <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The case has been cracked by the Japanese police.</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 13th, Kawakami, the chief inspector of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Hyogo Prefectural Police Department, Deputy Inspector Nagase, Special Agent Oka, and others gathered in Osaka on the night of the 11th. They conducted a thorough search of the home of Ibuki Hiroshi, a graphic printing technician who runs a business in Beiwaki-cho, Asahi Ward, Osaka, as well as the basement of a house he rented. They seized a Fukutoku Clavier photogravure printing machine and a bundle of forged banknotes of the Bank of China in Shanghai. As a result of activities in various parts of Osaka City, many people involved in forging Chinese banknotes were arrested. After strict interrogation, they confessed that since the beginning of this month, they had been using Osaka and Kobe as bases to forge ten-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Reclamation Bank. They were secretly selling them to Chinese and Japanese people for about 2.5 yuan each. The accomplices included Koshimoto Sotaro and seven or eight others from Yawahiroya Matsunomachi 1-chome, Minato Ward, Osaka. Ibuki lived in Beiwaki-cho, Asahi Ward, last September and ran a graphic design business in Kujo Street 2-chome, Minato Ward. At the same time, he rented another house near his home and used the basement of that house as a printing plant, printing 100 ten-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China. (These banknotes circulated in Zhejiang Province.) Dai Kejie, the manager of the Osaka branch, has identified them. It has now been determined that there are 17 accomplices, most of whom are repeat offenders of forging banknotes or bank notes. It is reported that about 100,000 yuan worth of forged Chinese banknotes were printed, and the main culprits are Koshimoto and Ibuki.</p>

<p>Using bad checks as a tool for swindling, the scheme was discovered because of the cheap price of thermos bottles.</p>
<p>Jin Keming, Chen Weixin, Zhuang Jiming, Zhou Longjiang, and others previously partnered to open the Guotai Commercial Firm with the slippery name in Fengrui Lane, Behe Road. They hired Gong Dazeng from Tongzhou as a salesman and Shao Xingge from Changzhou as an accountant. They specialized in filling out blank checks with amounts and swindling goods from various companies, which they then sold off and divided the profits. The number of victims is countless. Jin and others were well aware that this trick could only work for a short time and could not be a long-term plan. Therefore, last month, they secretly moved to No. 4, Lane 60, Avenue Edward VII, to rebuild their business.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Continuing to Defraud <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Salesman Gong Dazeng went around to various companies to buy goods, giving them bad checks. On the 8th of last month, Gong, in the name of Guotai Commercial Firm, went to the Guohua Thermos Bottle Factory at No. 6, Lane 302, Wuchang Road, and selected 18 boxes of thermos bottles, valued at 2,106 yuan. When the goods were delivered to Guotai Commercial Firm, they only received a Kangziang Qianzhuang bill for 1,000 yuan. They claimed that the remaining amount would be sent later. The partners of the Guohua Factory did not know at the time that Guotai was a</p>
<h3 id="e170">Slippery Commercial Firm <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, they took the bill and returned. Later, Shen Heying, a representative of Guohua, found that the thermos bottles sold in the Hongshunchang Grocery Store on Rue Robert in western Shanghai were particularly cheap. He secretly investigated and bought a dozen thermos bottles for 10.8 yuan. After Shen inspected them, he found that the thermos bottles were produced by Guohua. According to the original wholesale price, each dozen should cost 14.4 yuan, but Hongshunchang was only selling them for 10.8 yuan, which was suspicious. After further investigation, it was learned that the thermos bottles were sold at a low price by Guotai. A letter was sent to Kangziang Qianzhuang to verify the bill, and it was found that Guotai</p>
<h3 id="e171">Had No Funds <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Then they went to Guotai to inquire, but the doors were tightly closed, and there was no one there. Shen then knew that he had been cheated and began to investigate. On the 5th of this month, he discovered that the group was hiding in Room 4 of the Zhonghua New Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. He reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detectives Ma Zhongrong and Bao Zhang Yutian to investigate. They only arrested Gong Dazeng and Shao Xingge. The rest had already escaped without a trace. They were taken to the police station, and then to the</p>

<p>To search, and seized an iron box, 46 cans of tea, 38 bottles of various perfumes, 80 cans of face powder, 43 bottles of hair cream, six glass cabinets, 14 chairs, two tables, and six tea tables, all of which were taken to the police station. The next morning, Gong and Shao were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special District Court for interrogation. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the police station, rose and described the above situation in detail, and submitted the bad checks as evidence, saying that the two defendants are currently being prosecuted under Article 364 of the Criminal Law for habitual fraud. Shen Heying, Yuan Bingsheng, and other victims successively filed cases, stating the circumstances of their fraud. When questioned, Gong Dazeng and Shao Xingge pushed the blame, saying that these matters were all done by Jin Keming and others, and that they were only partners. They also hired a lawyer to defend them. After Judge Xue examined the confessions, he ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>Last month, he lived in Beiwaki-cho, Asahi Ward, and ran a graphic design business in Kujo Street 2-chome, Minato Ward. At the same time, he rented another house near his home and used the basement of that house as a printing plant, printing 100 ten-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China.

<p>One shot in the chest and one shot in the left arm, succumbing to injuries en route.</p>
<p>At around 10:30 PM last night, several gunshots suddenly rang out on the wasteland next to the Wayside Garden near Huishan Road and Huacheng Road. The nearby residents were extremely alarmed. While they were investigating, a villager happened to pass by. In the darkness, he vaguely saw a woman lying on the ground. He quickly went forward to check and found that she was barely breathing, and blood was flowing all over the grass. The villager rushed to the Yulin Road police station to report. The detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate and found that the person lying on the ground was indeed a woman, about twenty years old, with short hair, wearing jade-colored silk stockings, Zhongshan shoes, and a light lotus-colored free cloth cheongsam. She had one gunshot wound in the chest and one in the left arm and was on the verge of death. They quickly sent her to the hospital by car, but she succumbed to her injuries en route. The identity of the murderer is still unknown. The police are currently investigating and searching for the perpetrator and investigating the identity of the deceased. Based on the above circumstances, it is feared that it was a case of rape and murder.</p>

<p>Due to low freight volume and uneconomical operation, the Transportation Department is authorized to handle ferry crossing fees, which will be collected in cash.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the joint transportation train service between Shanghai and Beiping on September 1, the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administrations stipulated that trains No. 401 and No. 402 on the Jinghu Line would be used for joint transportation of goods between Shanghai and Beiping, and strictly prohibited staff from bringing relatives and friends on the Shanghai-Beiping train. The Ministry's regulations stipulate military transportation and government accounting methods, which are detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Operation of Freight Trains <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The railway recently revised its train schedule, stipulating that trains No. 401 and No. 402 on the Jinghu Line are specifically for loading goods for joint transportation between Shanghai and Beiping. Before the ferry is completed, trains will depart daily from both Jinghu stations once each for upstream and downstream operations. However, because vehicles cannot currently cross the river directly, the amount of goods loaded is extremely limited. Moreover, the departure times of these trains are earlier than other trains, so they often cannot catch up even when used to load goods from this line. As a result, a train departs on schedule, but carries very few goods, wasting the capacity of the locomotive and vehicles, which is uneconomical. The authority to operate these two trains will be temporarily delegated to the Transportation Department to carefully handle the freight situation along the line before the ferry is completed, in order to avoid waste. A report will be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for record.</p>

<p>The opening of the Jinghu Line's 301 and 302 Shanghai-Beiping joint transportation trains is extremely important for railway revenue. All fares must be collected in cash. All discounted accounting, or free preferential certificates, half-price military tickets, half-price tickets for various National Government departments, and accounting trailers are not applicable. The Vehicle Department has forwarded the Ministry's order to all departments for compliance. In order to strictly enforce the decree, the department yesterday sent another letter to all relevant personnel, stating that (except for employees who are actually serving on the train, other people holding any official travel permits or service travel licenses are not applicable and must purchase tickets separately to ride the train. If any train staff members allow relatives and friends to ride the train without tickets, or collude and allow them to ride with inapplicable tickets, they will be dismissed immediately upon verification, without leniency.</p>

<p>After the opening of the capital ferry, the methods for military transportation and government accounting transportation have been approved by the Executive Yuan after being submitted by the Ministry of Railways as follows: (1) All ferry crossing fees will be collected in cash and will not be accounted for. (2) Shanghai-Beiping joint transportation direct special express trains, Shanghai-Beiping-Hutong joint transportation direct freight trains, and segmented responsible joint transportation direct freight trains, whether upstream or downstream, are not applicable to government accounting or discount methods, and military transportation with accounting or discounts. (3) Other trains on each line, such as those with chapter regulations, and special restrictions, will be handled according to past methods, except that ferry crossing fees will be collected in cash. (4) Regarding military, military supplies, and military equipment, ammunition, and other vehicles, they should be allowed to cross the ferry, but they must comply with the following requirements: A. All ferry crossing fees will be collected in cash. B. Comply with the Capital Railway Ferry Joint Transportation Freight Vehicle Inspection Regulations promulgated by the Ministry. Special attention should be paid to the restrictions in Article 3 (A) to (E) of the regulations. C. Although these vehicles are allowed to cross the ferry, this transportation has always been the responsibility of the originating agency to send personnel to escort them, and should still be handled according to previous regulations. The railway cannot be responsible. D. Due to the gradient on both sides of the ferry crossing, it is easy to cause danger. The loading of the interior of these vehicles should be given special attention by the originating agency, and should be carefully handled under the guidance of railway personnel. Also, explosives such as dynamite, gunpowder, bombs, hand grenades, etc., which the railway deems dangerous and unsuitable for crossing the ferry, shall not be allowed to cross the ferry to ensure safety. E. In addition to carrying Shanghai-Beiping joint transportation direct express train passenger cars across the river, the ferry should give priority to carrying ordinary freight trains across the river. It has been found that the construction of the capital ferry was funded by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, and principal and interest must be repaid monthly in the future, and it is also the second guarantee for the Yuehan Railway loan. This has been clearly stated in case No. 417 of the complete collection of full fees for Shanghai-Beiping traffic, and has been approved. Therefore, no matter what type of vehicle crosses the river, it is necessary to collect the ferry crossing fee in cash. In addition, the ferry's capacity to transport vehicles is limited, so it is necessary to slightly restrict it to maintain traffic and emphasize railway administration. In order to avoid future disputes and misunderstandings, the above regulations must be formulated in fact, in order to achieve the effect of careful beginnings and uniformity.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Du Chongyuan's Speech on September 18th <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Du Chongyuan, President of the China National Products Cooperative, gave a special speech on the National Humiliation of September 18th at the Sichuan Road YMCA. Ms. Liang, a stenographer from the Bingxun Stenography Agency, recorded the speech. Although it was raining heavily that day, many people attended the meeting. The following is an excerpt from his speech: "The Chinese people think that the September 18th Incident was something that came out of the blue. However, this national disaster did not happen overnight. Since Japan destroyed Korea, it has had the ambition to invade our Northeast. Since the Russo-Japanese War, it has tried its best to control all undertakings in the Northeast, preparing to occupy our Northeast. After the Meiji Restoration, it actively instilled the idea of invading China into its own people, and tried its best to prevent our national movement, sometimes using economic power and sometimes using political power. These are all steps in its progress towards China. It tried its best to show China's shortcomings and all kinds of bad things, and taught its own people to admire the strengths of the British and American countries and not to learn China's shortcomings. But on the one hand, it tried its best to hide the rich resources of China's land and instill them into the minds of its ordinary people. The methods it used were entirely commercialized. The biscuits it ate were printed with the names of our three northeastern provinces: Jilin, Fengtian, and Heilongjiang. When customers came to buy them, they didn't ask to buy biscuits, but to buy Jilin, Fengtian, or Heilongjiang. When they met those small customers, they even asked them one by one if they liked them. If they said they liked them, they would say to them, 'These are fake Jilin, Fengtian, and Heilongjiang. If they were real Jilin, Fengtian, and Heilongjiang, they would be hundreds of times better!' There was also a kind of biscuit called 'Manzhou.' All of these were actions aimed at annexing the Northeast. In the political sphere, it often sent large groups of workers to work in our Northeast, while at the same time investigating the situation in the Northeast. Almost all Japanese people in the Northeast had a map of Manzhou. What the people it had in the Northeast did was nothing more than work to invade and occupy Manzhou. For example, if it ran a newspaper, it would use the power of the news to cater to the psychology of our people and win them over. For example, when warlords like Zhang Zongchang and Zhang Zuolin were rampant, they would say in the newspapers how those warlords were harming the people, while at the same time showing how much their own government loved the people. These were all facts before September 18th. It took active actions everywhere, but what about us? We almost always failed. Only the 19th Route Army and the Northeast Volunteer Army won a few victories, but the result was still failure. We must have a unified direction and unite in order to save our China. Therefore, talking about the national humiliation of September 18th is nothing more than wanting everyone to unite together. If we can unite together and resist with one heart and one mind, then China will have a day of revival."</p>
<h3 id="e182">Comparison of Speed of Mail to Europe <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (19th) it was said that mail from Europe to Shanghai, if labeled with the words "via Siberia and Dalian," could arrive in Shanghai earlier. The local postal authorities have denied this. It is said that labeling mail with the word "Dalian" is not enough to affect the delivery route of the mail. Unless the postal authorities of the countries concerned have separately agreed on a special agreement, it will still be delivered according to the usual route. As for mail from Europe to Shanghai via Siberia, the route it takes to Shanghai after arriving at the Siberian border is entirely determined by the Soviet authorities. At present, mail from Europe to Shanghai via Siberia often takes a month to arrive, while mail sent to Hong Kong via the same route only takes 20 to 22 days. This is because one route is via Vladivostok and Japan to Shanghai, while the other route is via Dalian to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Truth Revealed in the Case of the Tobacco and Paper Shop Clerk Being Falsely Accused of Theft <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Luo Jishang Acquitted and Released</p>
<p>Wang Wengen, a clerk at the Dongchang Tobacco and Paper Shop on Wusong Road, was carrying 1,300 yuan in cash on June 5th when he was suddenly stopped and robbed of the money by three robbers on North Suzhou Road, who then fled. Wu Leshan, one of the robbers, was subsequently captured and sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where he was interrogated and sentenced to seven years in prison. Later, the Central Police Department arrested Luo Ayin, an accomplice. After investigation, Luo suddenly falsely accused Luo Jishang, a Ningbo native who worked as a clerk at the tobacco and paper shop, of being an accomplice in the robbery, and Luo Jishang was also arrested. His relatives and friends in Shanghai immediately hired lawyer Lin Yangqing to defend him, saying that Luo Jishang had been working for several years and had always been honest, and that Luo Jiyin did not know him at all, let alone participate in the robbery. This time, he was falsely accused in an attempt to frame him. They begged for a clear investigation, a quick release, and the protection of the innocent and the importance of people's lives. After repeated summons and investigations of the case by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the First Special Court, Huang Baochang, the manager of Qinchang, also testified that Luo Jishang did not know that Wang Wengen had been ordered to take the money out that day. Judge Qian, having learned the truth, announced his judgment yesterday: Luo Jishang was innocent, and Luo Ayin was sentenced to seven years in prison. The police representative stated that they were abandoning the appeal regarding Luo Jishang, and the court immediately released him. Luo Ayin was sent to prison.</p>

<p>Zhang Bing-sheng, a sampan boat dweller of the Wayside Wharf Barge Company, age 39, a native of Wusong, was moored at the Guangxing Road pier in Yangshupu on the evening of the 18th of this month. Unexpectedly, that day was marked by a severe hurricane and heavy rain in Shanghai, which snapped his mooring ropes. Zhang was unable to control the boat, leading to the capsizing of both boat and man, and they drifted away without a trace. It wasn't until 8 o'clock yesterday morning that the Customs water police, having received many reports of boat dwellers lost in the severe storm, dispatched patrol boats to investigate. They discovered the body in the Yangshupu river mouth and transported it to the South Wharf Life Saving Bureau. Detective Xu Jue-lu was also dispatched to report the finding to the local court for verification.</p>

<p>Ding Hai-shan, a night watchman from the second division of the sixth district in Shanghai West, was patrolling Haig Road at approximately 10 o'clock last night when a passerby reported that a student was lying unconscious by the roadside on Qiaodun Road (behind Jiaotong University). Officer Ding immediately went to investigate and determined that the individual had likely ingested poison. When questioned, the student was unable to speak. Consequently, arrangements were made to transport him to the Haig Road Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the poisoning, rescue was impossible. He passed away at the hospital at 4 o'clock this morning. Six suicide notes were found on the deceased, signed Huang Senquan. The letters, in essence, addressed his wife, stating that the wedding expenses, totaling over a thousand yuan, were borrowed from various sources and remain unpaid. Now that she had abandoned him and pursued a new romance, he could no longer bear to live in this world and therefore resolved to commit suicide. However, no address was provided. The deceased appeared to be around 30 years old, wearing a twill student uniform, a white undershirt, reddish-gray Western socks, and had a shaved head with short hair. No other belongings were found. Yesterday afternoon, the second division of the sixth district notified the local court, which dispatched a prosecutor to conduct an examination. The examination confirmed that Huang Senquan had indeed died from poisoning. After investigating the family, instructions were given to take photos for record and to hand over the body to the local guardian for burial.</p>

<p>Jiang Chen, a young woman from Huaicheng, Jiangbei, residing at No. 46, 40 Jian, Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, aged 27, has recently engaged lawyer Zhu Dianqing to file a criminal lawsuit in the Second Special Court against Jiang Fuyin, a fellow villager, for fraudulent marriage, abuse, and abandonment, seeking investigation and prosecution, with an attached civil suit. The basis of her lawsuit states that the plaintiff followed her father to Shanghai to make a living from a young age. When she reached marriageable age, the defendant, seeing that the plaintiff had some beauty and learning that her parents had some savings, became covetous. Day and night, he made various advances, and then enlisted a neighbor to act as a matchmaker to the plaintiff's mother, wanting to marry the plaintiff. The plaintiff's mother knew that he was a wolf in sheep's clothing, and instructed the plaintiff to be careful to prevent accidents. However, the defendant schemed and spoke jokingly, saying that he was single and willing to make a lifelong commitment. He also said that if she married someone else, he would kill her spouse, and if she left Shanghai, he would blind her and cut off her tendons. Before long, his attitude changed, and he was pleasant and comforting. At the time, the plaintiff ignored him, but the defendant thought that he could deceive a woman, and followed her everywhere, wanting to rape her. Unfortunately, the plaintiff's awareness was weak, and she was raped. The defendant then said that the formalities of marriage had been completed, making people believe that they were husband and wife, and found a house to live together, living in peace. However, the plaintiff's mother had no sons, so she loved her daughter like a pearl, privately hoping that she would have someone to rely on in her old age. The defendant, seeing that this first goal had been achieved, began to plot for money, borrowing repeatedly. So the plaintiff's mother lent him all her savings and membership fees, totaling more than 600 yuan. He first bought more than ten rickshaws, and several years later, he gradually accumulated funds and bought 29 rickshaws. From then on, the family was well-off, but the defendant then had the intention of abandonment, scolding and abusing her all day long, ignoring her livelihood, for half a year. She recently learned that the defendant's wife was still alive and had children. After the plaintiff married the defendant, she also had a son and a daughter. Now, he suddenly abandoned her, leaving her with no means of support. Therefore, she was forced to file a lawsuit, requesting that he be investigated and dealt with according to Article 244 of the Criminal Law, and also attached a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering him to pay living expenses to support her. According to the complaint, the court summoned him yesterday afternoon. First, the defendant's lawyer claimed that the plaintiff had already filed a lawsuit in the local court, which was being heard today, and the defendant was being held in custody. According to the litigation regulations, one case cannot have two lawsuits, so the case should be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the case was filed in this court first, but the defendant fled to the Chinese area, so she also filed a lawsuit in the local court. Whether this case should be accepted should be decided by the court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo reviewed the words and ordered it to be withdrawn and await a ruling.</p>

<p>Zhou Jincai from Yangzhou, from April to August of this year, impersonated the American-owned Lange Foreign Company, using the pretext of recruiting workers to haul timber in the South Seas Islands, with a monthly wage of 65 yuan. With the Turkish national Iman Mateng as manager and Zhou himself as foreman, they privately set up a recruitment agency at No. 18 Songpan Lane, Songpan Road, employing assistants such as Zhou Lichun and Zhou Jinsai. More than a hundred people were swindled, totaling more than 700 yuan. After the incident, Chinese Detective Liu Wenzao arrested Zhou and ten others and sent them to the First Special District Local Court. After repeated hearings and deliberations, the case was finally concluded and a date was set for sentencing. It was reported in detail in the newspaper. Yesterday morning, the sentencing date arrived. Judge Liu Yugui presided over the sentencing in the Third Criminal Court. Defendant Zhou Jincai was sentenced to one year in prison, Zhou Jinbao, Fei Zhaofeng, Xu Hechun, Lü Zhenmao, and Wei Fu were each sentenced to three months in prison, and Zhou Lichun was sentenced to two months in prison.

<h3 id="e193">Fresh Meat Industry Finalizes Aviation Donation <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Decided to Allocate 100,000 Yuan – Requests Shanghai Finance Bureau to Allocate Accordingly</p>
<p>The aviation salvation donation undertaken by the fresh meat industry in this city was originally planned in March of this year, with the Fresh Meat Industry Association pledging to raise 100,000 yuan. However, due to internal disputes within the association, the sales industry began collecting 2 cents per pig on July 1st, but the aviation salvation donation has not yet been collected. Nevertheless, the association will find a way to collect the donation. Recently, the association sent a letter to the Aviation Association stating that after the association pledged 100,000 yuan for the aviation salvation fund, it could have started collecting in May. However, due to opposition and sabotage by a small number of colleagues, it has been delayed until now. Now, in order to save the country, the association will allocate 100,000 yuan from the public funds of the slaughter tax of 9 cents per pig, managed by the Committee for the Improvement of Slaughtering Expenses for the Inland Industry. The method is to hand over the funds and all accounting documents managed by the committee to your association and request that the committee cease its work. It is estimated that the number of pigs slaughtered annually in the inland industry is approximately 400,000, and the slaughter tax is 9 cents per pig, totaling approximately 40,000 yuan per year. Since the establishment of the committee in August 1931, the funds that it has managed, in addition to subsidies for education expenses for the children of colleagues and expenses for the North and South City Night Schools and hygiene, have not been announced, and the association has no way of knowing. After receiving the funds, your association should investigate the existing funds and allocate them to the aviation donation first. After collecting the full amount of 100,000 yuan, it should be handed back to the association for its own management. However, during the period of collection by your association, 30% of the total annual amount will still be allocated for the inland industry's hygiene improvement expenses, and 600 yuan per month will still be subsidized for the North and South City Night Schools. After receiving the letter, the Aviation Association held a meeting yesterday with representatives from all parties in the fresh meat industry. The attendees included Zhou Chengxiang, Wang Fusheng (Xujiahui), Zhang Fugen, Xu Wenhua, Yang Qiusheng (Tanzhiwan), Hu Yongchun (Pudong Laobaidu), He Chengjun (Caohejing), Qin Zucha, Chen Zhaoan, Cao Yunsong (Zhenru), Sun Huangzong, Mao Bin (Hongzhen), Wu Linfa (Qiujiang Bridge), Zhou Yueliang, Qin Yangen, Zhang Jisheng (Caojiadu), Jin Guifu, Shen Xie, Rong Qianchu, Zhu Yunxing, Ye Shifan, Ye Hengxian, Huang Jicun, Ye Dajia, Lu Jichen (Zhabei), and Zhu Zhigao (Nanshi), totaling 26 people. Li Dachao chaired the meeting, and Zhang Yuliang took notes. The chairman reported that the government is paying close attention to aviation and preparing to complete a powerful air force in the shortest possible time. The citizens of this city have suffered greatly from airplanes and know the importance of aviation. Therefore, they have taken the lead in advocating aviation salvation, enthusiastically joining the Aviation Association, and donating aviation funds. In particular, colleagues in the fresh meat industry can take on a fighter plane, and the mayor is very gratified. Rong Qianchu then reported on the donation and the process of the proposal. Mao Bin reported on the use and distribution of the 9-cent slaughter tax. Finally, all the representatives expressed their opinions, generally saying that the 9-cent slaughter tax has been in place for two years, and even the education subsidies are still in arrears. Other distributions are simply out of the question and should be donated to aviation for salvation. It was then decided that 30% would still be used for hygiene equipment expenses, and 70% would be used entirely for the aviation salvation fund. However, within the 70%, 600 yuan per month must still be set aside for education expenses until 100,000 yuan is reached. Before the 100,000 yuan is reached, the 9-cent slaughter tax will be kept by the Aviation Association, and several representatives from the meat industry will supervise the process. The Aviation Association will also send a letter to the municipal government, requesting that the Finance Bureau transfer all the remaining funds from the 9-cent slaughter tax over the past two years to the aviation salvation fund. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Fudan Defeats Hujiang to Win Men's Volleyball Championship <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The City Games men's volleyball final between Fudan and Hujiang was held at 4:30 PM at the Chinese Athletic Field. Fudan's flying general, Cao Tingzan, returned to the field to lead the team. Although he was overweight and unable to jump and spike, his coordination of the team was very effective. As a result, despite Hujiang's strength, they had to concede defeat. The match was decided in four sets, with Fudan maintaining their dominant position as a perennial champion.</p>

<h3 id="e232">First Set, Fudan is Fierce <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the match, Hujiang seemed flustered, and Fudan also had few special performances. After 6-6, Fudan's Cao Tingzan served fiercely, gaining the upper hand with an 11-7 lead. After switching sides, Fudan's momentum suddenly surged. Front row players Cheng Mingjue and Cao Tingzan were effective in blocking, and Qiu Guangxie took the opportunity to jump and spike, unstoppable. The score progressed to 17-7. Under the threat of Yan Li, Hujiang had little activity, and with their rear formation in disarray, Fudan won the set 21-11.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Second Set, Deadly and Effective <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the second set, Fudan's Zhang Qunguang served, and their defense at the net was tight, leaving Hujiang with no opportunity to attack. The score became 9-3, with Fudan again gaining the advantage. Hujiang tried hard to rally, with Lu Kangyuan shouting encouragement, and they worked together to kill each point effectively, bringing the score to 7-9. However, Fudan still won the first half of the set 11-7. The situation became more intense after the change of sides, with Qiu Guangxie and Lu Kangyuan each showing their skills, going head-to-head. The ball flew back and forth like a cannonball, but Fudan always maintained the advantage, and Hujiang was unable to recover, with Fudan winning again 21-15.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Third Set, Hujiang Recovers <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>In the third set, Fudan still had the advantage, leading 11-6 in the first half, which seemed to create a situation where they would win the match in three straight sets. Unexpectedly, when Fudan was leading 18-14 and 19-16, their formation became disorganized, and Hujiang took the opportunity to attack, leaving Fudan with no chance to respond. Hujiang moved forward steadily and won the set 21-19, showing a resurgence and a promising momentum.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Fourth Set, Groping in the Dark <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The third set ended, and the sun had already set. In the second half of the fourth set, the sky was already dark. Both sides groped in the dark, and the game became simpler. A successful kill was sure to score. Both sides made contributions in the tense first half, and the situation was very tight. Hujiang switched sides leading 11-10. However, after Fudan's Zhang Qunguang served, the score jumped ahead, with Fudan leading 16-12. Later, the score became 19-13. If they could score two more points, they could determine the victory. However, Hujiang did not relax, maintained a tight defense, and denied Fudan the opportunity to score. So after 20-16 (Fudan ahead), Fudan almost failed to add this valuable point. Hujiang reached 18-20, showing a situation similar to the previous set, coming from behind. Fudan had to work harder and finally won the final victory 21-18.</p>

<p>Jinan Defeats Xingguang: Jinan's lineup yesterday was completely new, with Yahui as the leading captain, Tan Di at the center, and Jiang and Gu guarding the two flanks. Xu Heng was in charge of the old camp. This lineup was a preliminary exercise for the finals. Xingguang's strength was far less than Jinan's, and their main players, Jiang Chao and Luo Douwen, deserted at the last minute, greatly weakening their strength. They fought with all their might in the first half, but still couldn't avoid losing four goals. In the second half, Jinan's players took advantage of the Xingguang goalkeeper's immature technique and adopted a long-range shooting strategy, firing from a distance and scoring every time. Liang Shutang, who had not fully recovered from his illness, sang his sick tune as if he was a treasure, and actually scored repeatedly, which was commendable. Xingguang failed to get close to the goal even once, losing twelve goals in a muddled and confused manner, which was also miserable.</p>

<p>Donghua Defeats Huahua: "Struggling like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, not ashamed even in defeat, like touching a tiger's whiskers and hurting your hand, defeat is also heroic." This is no different from a lament for Huahua yesterday. Huahua is a team organized by Shanghai merchants. In terms of strength, they are not as good as the top teams, but better than the bottom teams. Yesterday, they met the strong opponent Donghua, and knowing that they would lose, they were unwilling to surrender and be beaten, and the whole army swore to fight to the death, working together with all their strength to resist desperately. Even under the pressure of Donghua's sophisticated equipment and heavy firepower, they frequently launched counterattacks, which also managed to disturb Donghua's internal defenses, making people feel uneasy. It's just that Guan and Feng, like two earth elementals, under the leadership of Dr. Ju, had electric nets and lime bottles everywhere, making it difficult for Huahua to move an inch. Li Ning was as fierce as ever, wielding his big knife, and Fu Zhibin, Jia Youliang and others, although constantly probing east and west, found it impossible to find an opening. Five minutes before the end of the second half, Huahua had already lost seven goals, and everyone expected that Huahua would not escape the record of scoring zero eggs this time. Who knew that Huahua's counterattack would become even more urgent, and Dr. Tu made a slight mistake, allowing a leopard and wolf to enter the room. Jia Youliang passed the ball in front of the goal, and Huang Guorong arrived in time, smashing Fan's wooden door with a bang, making the score 7-1.</p>

<p>Fifth District Wins Over Third District Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, the football quarterfinals were held. In the first match, the Fifth District played against the Third District in a fierce 90-minute battle. The Fifth District won convincingly with a score of 5-0. In the first thirty minutes, neither side scored. Later, the Third District's defense became weak. The Fifth District's center forward, Shen Fugeng, dribbled straight up, and from a short distance from the goal, his kick was slightly off, and the ball rolled towards the goalpost. The Fifth District then had a penalty kick opportunity, but they missed it by shooting too high. Shen atoned for his mistake by breaking through the defense, fearlessly charging straight into the enemy's territory, and the Third District lost a goal. This was the result of the first half. In the second half, although the Third District tried hard to counterattack, the Fifth District continued their efforts, scoring four more goals. In the end, the score was 5-0. The Fifth District won the right to compete in the final and will compete with the Second District for the championship.</p>

<p>Second District Wins Over First District The second football quarterfinal match, between the First District and the Second District, was held at 10:00 AM. The Second District took advantage of their victory from the previous day and calmly fought. In the first two halves, each scored three goals. The First District was a disorganized team, and their formation was scattered, resulting in a crushing defeat. The captain of the First District, Yu Guanfa, who was originally the "iron gate" of Zhenjiang, became enraged by the loss. In the second half, he took on the role of a striker, showing extraordinary courage. However, due to his habit of using his hands, he blocked the ball with his hand on the defensive line in the last minute, resulting in a penalty kick for the Second District. Overall, the players of the Second District were all lively, their movements were quick, and they made few mistakes. Their overwhelming victory was not accidental.</p>

After determining the positions, the battle began. Passing the ball, Yu from the Fourth District committed a foul, and the Sixth District scored with a free throw, opening the record.

The famous Shanghai player Qian Dingshen was especially active, surpassing the Sixth District with a score of 16-3. The Sixth District was forced to call a timeout, but it was to no avail. At the end of the first half, the Fourth District was far ahead with a score of 26-3. After the break, the Fourth District continued their efforts, and the score continued to increase. Seeing that the opponent had no power to resist, they brought out their reserve team to play. The Sixth District then had the opportunity to score, but because of the large deficit, it was not easy to recover. They were eliminated with a score of 23-50. The referee was Zhang Le, and the recorder was Fei Xiyuan.</p>

<p>Second District Wins Over Twelfth District The Second District, which had previously defeated the Eleventh District, began at the Provincial Stadium. At the beginning, both sides had the momentum of victory and were evenly matched. They scored alternately, closely matched. The players of the Second District seemed less courageous than yesterday, so at the end of the first half, they were only ahead by two points. At the beginning of the second half, the Second District suddenly became as lively as dragons and tigers, completely different from the previous half. The three forwards, Zhou, Zhao, and Li, passed the ball quickly and shot accurately, greatly increasing the score. The players of the Twelfth District were flustered and had no intention of fighting, resulting in a complete defeat. Until the end of the time, they only scored two points. The referee was Qian Yiqin.</p>

<p>Seventh District Wins Over First District The women's basketball preliminary round between the First and Seventh Districts was held at 10:00 AM. After the start, the First District's guards were slightly negligent, and the Seventh District scored two points. They then made a free throw, adding another point. The forwards of the First District were anxious, but the ball often revolved in their own zone, and the guards were weak and unable to get the ball out. They trailed 3-13 in the first quarter. At the start of the second quarter, the competition between the two sides was more intense. Wang Yue of the First District was agile, but lacked teamwork, resulting in her heroism being wasted. In the last two quarters, the scores were also very close, but because of the large deficit in the first quarter, they finally lost 21-37. The referee was Zhou Jiaqi, and the recorder was Fei Xiyuan.</p>

<p>Third District Wins Over Twelfth District The second women's basketball preliminary round yesterday morning at 10:00 AM was between the Third District and the Twelfth District. The Third District had good teamwork, and the players of the Twelfth District were tall and strong. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time, and the situation was relatively even. At the end of the first half, the Third District led 11-6. In the second half, the Twelfth District worked hard to counterattack, scoring two goals and making one free throw, resulting in an equal score. However, Huang Lian of the Third District scored three times in a row, and the two forwards, Tao and Wu, also made contributions, and the record soared. In conclusion, the Third District won 32-15. The referee was Shu Hong, and the scorer was Wu Bangwei.</p>
<p>Second District Wins Over Eleventh District Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, there was also a women's basketball preliminary round, which was the Second District winning over the Eleventh District. The skills of the two sides were vastly different. The Eleventh District had no ability to fight back. In both halves, only the two forwards, Zhang and Wang, of the Second District were seen continuously scoring. The game became a one-sided affair. The Eleventh District was fortunate that Gao Da made a free throw, otherwise they would have been blanked. In conclusion, the Second District won overwhelmingly with a score of 50-1. The referee was Shu Hong.</p>

<p>Fourth District Wins Over First District Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the volleyball preliminary round was held. The first match was between the First District and the Fourth District. The First District only had players from the Zhenshi team, so their strength was weak. The spikes of the middle players of the Fourth District were very sharp, and the setting of the front row was also excellent. In conclusion, they won 3-0. The scores and lineups were not provided.</p>
<p>Third District Wins Over Fifth District The second match should have been between the Third District and the Fifth District. At the appointed time, the Third District appeared in uniform, but the Fifth District did not arrive after waiting for a long time. The referee then declared that the Fifth District had forfeited, and the Third District was awarded the victory with a score of 3-0.</p>

<p>Funding for Participation of Mongolia and Tibet Settled (Nanjing, 20th) The organizing committee of the National Games believed that Hong Kong should have one unit, but both the South China Athletic Association and the Chinese Athletic Association of Hong Kong had athletes participating. It has replied by telegram requesting that they be combined into one unit to comply with the regulations. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission informed the National Games that due to the inconvenient transportation in Mongolia and Tibet, it has instructed the Beijing offices of each league and banner to select athletes to participate. The Audit Department donated white yuan, the Accounting Department donated thirty yuan, and the Zhenwei Committee donated twenty yuan, requesting the National Games to produce prizes on their behalf.</p>
<p>Two Railway Administrations Plan to Open Special Trains between Beijing and Shanghai The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations previously received instructions from the Ministry of Railways that the 22nd National Games would be held in the capital during the Double Tenth Festival this year. They were instructed to add a passenger train from Shanghai to Beijing one day before the opening of the Games, and from Beijing to Shanghai one day after the closing of the Games. They immediately transferred the instructions to the Transportation Department for preparation. According to the report from the Transportation Department, (in accordance with the newly revised train timetable, and based on the speed of special express trains, it is planned to operate one passenger special train in each direction one day before the opening of the Games and one day after the closing of the Games. The northbound special train is scheduled to depart from Shanghai North Station at 17:00 and arrive in Nanjing at 23:25. The southbound special train is scheduled to depart from Nanjing Station at 7:20 and arrive in Shanghai at 14:09, but the passenger trains along the way may be slightly delayed due to the committee) and so on. The bureau has reported to the Ministry of Railways for instructions to be followed in accordance with Industry Letter No. 1660.</p>

<p>—Shou Juan</p>
<p>Preface The reason why no special issue was published on the 918 Incident was not due to laziness, but rather to observe three minutes of silence. Now, on the third morning of this tragic anniversary, after the pain has subsided and we have had time to reflect, we suddenly have this special issue, called "Untitled." "Untitled" does not belong to the same category as those old poets who specialize in writing romantic poems, but rather it is like what the Buddha said, "unspeakable, unspeakable." This is the preface.</p>
<h3 id="e271">To Do <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>—Jun Ti</p>
<p>The anniversary of the September 18th Incident has passed. After the pain has subsided and we have had time to reflect, we should also ask ourselves: Our beautiful land was taken away by the enemy for no reason. Although the enemy is committing robbery, which is despised by humanity, they dare not commit this robbery against other countries, but they have committed it against us. Is this not our great shame and humiliation?</p>
<p>The beautiful land we lost was originally garrisoned by hundreds of thousands of troops; but the enemy who came to seize it only numbered a few thousand. Is this not our great shame and humiliation?</p>
<p>The beautiful land we lost has been gone for two years: In these two years, not only have we not been able to recover it, but we have continued to lose it. Is this not our great shame and humiliation?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is our great shame—this is our great humiliation! We should not complain; nor should we blame others. So do not say that we are a naturally ill-fated nation; nor should we say that the League of Nations is not sincerely helping us: nor should we say that the government is not working hard; nor should we say that the military is not fulfilling their duties. The Republic of China belongs to all 400 million of our people. What we lost from our hands, we should recover from our hands. Those long sighs, calls for help, and begging for assistance are all signs of weakness.</p>
<p>We should dedicate our entire spirit and body completely; and we should combine the hearts of 400 million people into one. Then, if it is a matter of cultural work, no matter how beautiful or cheap the enemy's goods are, they cannot exchange for a penny from us; if it is a matter of military work, no matter how sharp or numerous the enemy's weapons are, they cannot defeat our 400 million people.</p>
<p>In other words, we should always do something, no matter what. There are two types of action, cultural and military. Cultural action means not buying the enemy's goods, and military action means fighting the enemy to the death.</p>
<p>My dear compatriots! Military action may require you to fight to the death, which you may be reluctant to do; cultural action not only does not require you to fight to the death, but also saves you money. Why are you unwilling to act fiercely even for this?</p>
<h3 id="e272">Night Ritual for the September 18th Incident <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>—Chen Liang</p>
<p>I got up early in the morning, without washing my face, and went alone to the hillside to pick a handful of yellow wildflowers and blood-red wildflowers to keep in water. That day, I didn't read or write, but just stayed in the corner of the room, with a sorrowful mood and sorrowful thoughts.</p>
<p>Silently waiting, waiting for the night to come. Night, as expected, came with a sad and gloomy face, and the autumn wind began to weep on the paper window. The old woman put the candlestick on the table by the window, and the flames kept jumping, making the room even more eerie.</p>
<p>So, I opened the door and ran out, carrying that handful of yellow and blood-red wildflowers.</p>
<p>Quietly, I quietly walked to the mass grave at the fork in the road, stopped, put down the flowers, and gave the mass grave a deepest salute. When I looked up, two lines of hot tears fell uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"The spirits of the martyred compatriots, perhaps you won't blame me for not bringing wine. Tonight, I offer you my sincere soul and this bouquet of nameless wildflowers. Since the night of September 18th two years ago, it has been exactly two years. Not only have we not recovered an inch of lost territory, but we have instead handed over tens of millions of square miles of land. The January 28th Incident in Shanghai added new wounds, and various hidden pains have occurred in North China. You must also be weeping in pain in the afterlife, right? It's not that we have failed your loyal and courageous sacrifice, but in reality, the environment makes us have a country that we cannot love, and blood that has nowhere to flow..."</p>

<p>—Shou Juan</p>
<p>On the day of the September 18th Incident, there was a rain that shook the town. Although this was a change in the weather, perhaps it was the national soul of China wailing and crying! It was crying about the unworthy descendants of the Yellow Emperor, who have been sitting idly by and watching the territory of the Northeast fall for two years, and are still singing and dancing happily, as if nothing has happened.</p>
<p>As long as the hearts of a fallen nation are not dead, there may be a day to restore the homeland. Only a nation whose heart is dead will fall into a place of eternal doom. Even if the country has not fallen, it is more pitiful than a fallen nation. "At the entrance of Black Clothes Lane, the setting sun slants, it is the new ridge of another family." These lines describe the hatred of the fall of the Ming Dynasty. How profound and painful! Today, looking north with our heads raised, tears wet our clothes. Alas, our Great Wall has also become the new ridge of another family! I said to myself and started to sob and cry.</p>
<p>What exactly can we, the survivors, do for those martyred, loyal, and courageous soldiers and a group of innocent compatriots who suffered?</p>
<h3 id="e274">Insufficient Prevention <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>—Feng Moni</p>
<p>Yesterday, our housemate, Old Lady Zhang, suddenly started arguing and shouting at home, so I went over to listen. It turned out that Old Lady Zhang had come back from the street and saw a copper hanging ornament hanging in a second-hand store. After a careful look, it turned out to be something from her own home. How could it have been moved to a second-hand stall? She couldn't help but get angry, and rushed home in a rage, making a big noise without asking the reason, leaving her daughter-in-law confused. Later, according to her daughter-in-law, there was indeed this copper hanging ornament before, but because it was old, she had bought a new one to replace it, and put the old ornament aside. Now that she found it on a second-hand stall, she thought of the old ornament, so she wanted to investigate. Old Lady Zhang's reason for making a fuss was like this, but since she still wanted this old ornament, she should have paid attention beforehand. Only after she found it on a second-hand stall did she start making a fuss. However, no matter how much she made a fuss, the rights already belonged to the second-hand stall owner.</p>
<p>Not to mention a family like this, even the country is no different. Look, France occupies the Nine Small Islands, and Japan occupies the Eight Small Islands. Before they were seized by others, we never heard of the Nine Small Islands or the Eight Small Islands. Only after they were seized by others did we start making a fuss. However, no matter how much we made a fuss, the things were still seized by others. We should have taken precautions beforehand, so that we would not be coveted by others. The story of Old Lady Zhang is the same fact as our country's small island incidents.</p>
<p>Then, we Chinese have not only these few small islands, there are still small islands, and we should quickly prepare for the future. There is no need to only realize that they are our own things after they have been seized by others. You must know that things that have reached the hands of others are not easy to take back. It is ten times more difficult than digging a loach out of a cat's mouth. If we do not take precautions, no matter how much we protest after being seized by others, it will be of no avail. In fact, it is all because of insufficient prevention.</p>

<p>The desolate and gloomy wilderness, bleak and deserted, exposes a ferocious and vicious face: the stars and moon cover up their bright light, and a sinister and terrifying murderous aura shrouds the bleak universe.</p>
<p>The patriotic heroes with hot blood are all crawling in the damp trenches, holding their breath and tightly gripping their sharp swords, quietly waiting for the enemy's attack.</p>
<p>The enemy's field guns suddenly roared, exploding around the heroes; the enemy's planes suddenly dropped giant bombs, bombing near the trenches. Flesh and blood splattered with shrapnel, dust rolled with smoke, the pungent smell of blood, the piled up white bones, sadly exposed the cruelty of war in the hazy mist!</p>
<p>The wicked enemy, relying on its fierce firepower, invaded our heavily guarded positions. These brave and unparalleled warriors, with just a roar, seemed like mountains collapsing and cracking! Everyone leaped out of the trenches like dragons and tigers, rushing towards the enemy's core,衝击! But seeing white blades flying, cold light flashing, people falling and horses collapsing, red blood spurting; the enemy's heads fell with the sharp blades, and the enemy's blood splattered with the flashing knife light! In just an instant, this vast battlefield was already littered with corpses and blood-soaked fields!</p>
<p>The brutal enemy thought that a night raid would surely win a surprise victory; who knew that because of the melee by our loyal and courageous soldiers, they suffered deep pain. So whenever the pitch-black night came, they would deeply harbor the terror of death and dare not try the taste of these sharp white blades again.</p>
<p>This battlefield covered with corpses, this sinister and terrifying battlefield, because of the gift of this pungent melee, the enemy also shrank its covetous ambitions, and trembled, not daring to look directly. Therefore, this battlefield of bombing and slashing has transformed into a silent and calm wilderness: the bleak and gloomy air covers this gray universe like a net, and the light of the stars and moon cannot be seen.</p>

<p>—Chao Ye</p>
<p>Recovering from illness is like pulling silk, no different from sitting in a sorrowful city all day long. In my free time, I turned over and read the Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Scrutiny, and suddenly saw the following passage:</p>
<p>"I proofread the secret books and went to the Mountain Resort four times: in the winter of Dingwei, in the autumn of Wushen, in the summer of Jiyou, and in the spring of Renzi. I have seen all the beauty of the four seasons. Every time I sailed to the Wenjin Pavilion, the mountains and water were all natural, the colors of the trees and the sounds were all from a non-worldly realm. The weather, both sunny and overcast, morning and evening, was in a thousand states and shapes. Even a bird or a flower was all picturesque. What was even more extraordinary was that the fine grass along the slopes and valleys was all like green felt, no more than a few inches high, as neat as if it had been cut, with not a single stem that was uneven or of different lengths. The gardeners called it 'regulated grass.' Just a few steps out of the palace walls, the whiskers and tendrils are already spreading and growing. Isn't it true that heavenly plants are born to await the imperial遊哉?"</p>
<p>After reading it once, it struck me with horror! It was as if I were there. According to the Mountain Resort, it is outside Xifengkou, commonly known as the Rehe Palace. The scenery within has already been almost completely depicted in the 137 words on the right! Such a good place, meticulously planned and managed, with nature's workmanship, has unfortunately already been occupied by no more than 200 enemy soldiers, without even losing an arrow, who marched in formation and calmly took possession of it! From now on, for all of us Chinese people who want to travel here, besides reading this record and dream-travelling, what else is there to do but wait for its recovery? Remembering the homeland, I am extremely sad. Could it be that heavenly plants are born, not to await the 胡游, but must await the 夷游?</p>
<h3 id="e277">Broadsword Guan Xiong by Huang Kewei <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>On a main street in Beiping City, countless people were packed together. Police officers with white leggings weaved back and forth, using their black wooden batons to keep them off the street, clearing a wide path. They all stood on their tiptoes, craning their necks, looking outwards, but all they could see were heads: bristly, bald, wearing large bamboo hats, wrapped in white cloth...</p>
<p>The red sun cast down a ball of fire, and the sweat on their heads felt like it was boiling! Wisps of cooked air rose upwards, but they wanted to see the column of soldiers marching to their deaths with composure, showing no signs of weariness or fatigue. They waited, waited for the team that was risking their lives for the country and the nation to arrive.</p>
<p>(Look! Our soldiers are here!) A cry arose from the crowd. Then, everyone applauded in unison, cheering thunderously, like a clap of thunder.</p>
<p>A long, snake-like column finally marched into the street amidst the waving of tens of thousands of hands. They all wore blue silk turbans, black short jackets buttoned tightly, black leggings, and straw sandals. Broadswords with wide blades rested on their shoulders, gleaming and reflecting the sunlight. Red silk ribbons were tied to the swords, embroidered with two large characters: "Die誓死"!</p>
<p>Leading the column was a burly man with round eyes, a wide mouth, a purplish face, and a full beard that was greenish. This was Guan Xiong! He was silent, his facial muscles tense. They were leaving the realm of the living, advancing towards the path of death!</p>
<p>(Long live the Broadsword Brigade!) (Long live the Broadsword Brigade!) The words slipped from someone's mouth, resounding powerfully.</p>
<p>Guan Xiong's facial muscles twitched, and a faint smile appeared. His two pupils stared at the broadsword, as if saying to it: (Be brave, chop off a few more enemy heads!)</p>
<p>The straw sandals made a "thump-thump" sound, stepping over the cobblestones, mud, and rugged roads of the Shuimen River, and finally, they arrived at the front line. The dim night, the large moon buried in dark clouds, struggled. Struggled, a faint light slipped out, shining on Guan Xiong's gray face in the gray trenches. He tightened his wide belt, took a breath, and concentrated all his strength in his arms. He tested the broadsword, squatted down, and said to his comrades: (Our ancestor was Guan Yu關雲長. He relied on it to break the Yellow Turban rebels, slay Yan Liang, and execute Wen Chou, killing six generals. Our grandfather was Guan Sheng關勝. He also relied on it to suppress Liangshan Marsh. It has been passed down to our hands, so we have to bury ourselves in it. I am truly ashamed, I am sorry to this sword, and I am sorry to our ancestors.)</p>
<p>Boom! A "Sun Brand" shell whizzed over his head. His comrades quickly pulled him down to lie down. He touched his head and continued to squat, saying: (Tonight we will behead the enemy, let this sword that has not tasted meat for a long time taste something foreign.) As he spoke, a bright light circled in the sky. This was an airplane.</p>
<p>"Down!" the company commander shouted sharply. Two lightning-like searchlights shone down, followed by a huge bomb, flying down quickly.</p>
<p>Boom! Soil and stones danced, and the smell of gunpowder filled the trenches. Guan Xiong buried his nose in his knees, his blood boiling! (Damn it! Why haven't we charged yet?)</p>
<p>"Slow down! Hold your ground!" The cannons roared one after another, and the gunshots added to the chaotic clamor. Bullet-like missiles whistled as they flew from that side to this side, from this side to that side, drilling into the mud and into the bodies of the soldiers.</p>
<p>"Charge! Brothers!" Guan Xiong roared, pressed his broadsword into the ground, and jumped out of the trench. Then, the Broadsword Brigade, like fierce tigers, bravely charged forward!</p>
<p>The machine guns on the other side swallowed bullets and shook their heads, spitting them out at one group, but another group charged up, constantly, endlessly. Guan Xiong gritted his teeth tightly. He took a few steps closer, took out a hand grenade, and threw it. With a bang, the machine gun tilted its head, and half a dwarf leg flew in front of him. He grinned ferociously, pointed his broadsword, and shouted loudly: "Forward! Only by moving forward can we find a way out!"</p>
<p>Enemy soldiers poured out of the trenches, and then the two sides engaged in a melee. Snow-bright broadswords, bayonets, scarlet blood, bullets, severed heads, arms, thighs, screams, and shouts were all mixed together.</p>
<p>Guan Xiong. He swung his broadsword, killing wildly, using his ancestral flower sword with all his might. He defeated many enemy soldiers, but he also fell to the ground, exhausted.</p>
<p>The wolf-like sound of the machine guns gradually subsided, and the rising sun broke through the hazy mist, but revealed a face that was visibly mourning. At this time, Guan Sheng climbed up from the pile of corpses. He rubbed his eyes, looked at the enemy soldier beside him with half his brain cut off, and trembled as if he felt something. He picked up the broadsword with a broken blade, stepped on the bloodstains, stepped on the corpses, and ran towards the bright rising sun.</p>

<h3 id="e278">Finance: Forward Silver, Exchange Rates, and Commodity Prices Continue to Rise; Gold Prices Fall Again by Six Yuan and Two Jiao <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Although the gold market declined yesterday, it rebounded and rose again, showing a very stable trend. In the early morning, the exchange rate between British and American currencies slightly decreased by 0.625 due to the rise of the Bank of England and the fall of the Bank of America. The US dollar increased by 0.75, and the US-French exchange rate also increased sharply by 0.55. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 0.058. The price of raw gold in London remained unchanged, while the price of wheat in the US rose by 0.1875, and the price of cotton in the US rose by 30 points. Stock prices showed both increases and decreases. The gold price of US Newmont Mining was 31.64 yuan, compared to the previous price of 31.44 yuan. The initial price of the rough market dropped by about 10 yuan. A Reuters report from the New York silver market mentioned that Senator Pittman requested the President to order the free minting of silver coins, and the price continued to fall to 55.6 yuan. Shortly after, Reuters reported that the Dutch government intended to maintain the gold standard within a certain budget, and the situation stabilized. The market continued to be firm after opening, with enthusiastic short covering. The exchange rate was tight again, and the gold price soared. The exchange rate posted by HSBC was flat for British currency and up 0.25 for the US dollar. It was even more attractive after the announcement. Although it rose at noon, it still fluctuated. Although there were rumors, they had little impact. The wholesale price was about 1085 yuan, with a swap discount of 8.3 to 9 yuan. Here is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day:</p>
<p>The market opened at 758 yuan in the morning, a sharp drop of 16.7 yuan compared to the previous close. The opening price of goods was 9.5 yuan. The opening selling price of the exchange rate market was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 5625 for the near-term British exchange rate and 31.1875 yuan for the US exchange rate. Mitsui and Huabi once purchased US dollars for January at 125, and the price reached 32 yuan for the same month after opening. Ruixing and Bingxing were strong buyers, and Yuanchun, Hengtai, and Hengxing also purchased. Retail investors raised prices, and Huabi even purchased US dollars for December at 0.6875.

<p>The Swap Transactions in the Municipal Market are Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange showed a slight sign of recovery. Swap transactions in the market are gradually increasing, and market prices have also become slightly more active. Everything depends on the relationship between supply and demand on the trading slips, completely unrelated to the depressing situation. It is only that the delivery period is getting closer and closer, and both long and short positions are preparing. In the first trade yesterday morning, the market atmosphere was quite firm. Although there was no large amount of inflow or outflow, the supply and demand already showed that they could not be evenly balanced, and the need was more urgent. Although the prices only rose by about 0.1 jiao, the trend was consistent. In the second trade, the 18th and 19th year bonds continued to rise by about 0.1 jiao, while the 20th year was stable with no ups or downs.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 19th initially fell and then rose due to short covering and the weakness of the gold yuan. However, there was still much waiting to see the development of inflation. Steel stocks were quite strong and were expected to continue to advance. Wheat rose due to purchases from the East, and then fell after long positions closed out. Later, there were large-scale purchases again. The market price was low, which was very favorable for buying. The cotton market rose because there was talk of raising cotton prices to 0.2 yuan, which was caused by the South's strong demand for inflation and various rumors from Washington. There were reports of large purchases from the Far East. The basis in Texas was very solid, and there was little hedging. The cotton cloth market was quiet. The silver market had a lot of speculative buying, and the closing was stable. The total number of shares traded for the day was 2,820,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation still has a trend of uncertain rise and fall. Although foreign cotton rose, gold prices fell, domestic real demand was not smooth, and the various gangs still had no purchasing power. This is all due to the people's poverty and financial exhaustion. In the morning market, a certain yarn mill said that a certain representative went to Beijing to petition, and it was rumored that a telegram had returned to Shanghai, saying that there may be a solution for cotton yarn. A large number of purchases were made in the futures market, about 7,000 to 8,000 bales, and the market price was agitated and rose by more than 1.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Forward Yarn Rose by 1 Yuan <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>

In the afternoon, it was heard that a certain factory opened 3,500 pieces of 20-count yarn, and people's hearts were empty again, and the market fell. The price of each month fell by 0.4, 5, 6, and 8 jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 43,300 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 2,600 bales, Mingde 950 bales, Renfeng 1,500 bales, Changfeng 2,650 bales, Dachang 2,050 bales, Xincheng 1,400 bales, and Yuanda 1,050 bales.

<p>The cotton market is trending upward. Because the US cotton air is good, and there is talk that the villagers are requesting the government to maintain prices at 0.2 yuan, people's hearts are greatly shaken, buyers are active, purchases are increasing, and the upward trend is fierce. However, if US cotton rises, the silver price will rise, and the calculated silver disk price is still low. In addition, domestic finance is exhausted, the yarn market is depressed, and various routes are launching new products, so the attitude of short positions remains calm. However, in recent times, the number of packages traded by both long and short parties has been increasing, and the future changes are unpredictable.</p>

<p>Zheng Biao opened in the morning market. Because there was news that US cotton had expanded currency, the buying sentiment was stronger, and each month rose by 0.4, 5, and 6 jiao.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals numbered nearly fifty boats. The market, due to the initial pause in the storm surge, saw fewer ships arriving. Furthermore, as Pudong's backlog had cleared, confidence remained firm. Consequently, the initial market conditions were quite tight. Both retail and wholesale purchases were brisk, totaling over two thousand packages. However, as noon approached, the trend reversed. Despite sellers' attempts to raise prices, sales stagnated, rendering them powerless. As a result, price increases varied among different suppliers. Statistics show that prices for regular suppliers, Suzhou suppliers, and South Port suppliers, including broken japonica and aged Lu Yangjian types, remained stable. Prices for green-husked, Songjiang-Sihui, thin-husked rice, and new japonica, new Du Yangjian, all increased by a few cents. Bianyuan also increased by a few cents. Yinyuan remained mediocre. A limited supply of fragrant japonica continued to arrive, and the market was quite brisk, with prices increasing by twenty cents. Factory-made Dongxin has not yet opened.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty boats arrived from various River-Down routes. Sales were quite lively. The market saw slight increases in the price of top-grade broken japonica by a small fraction. Medium and lower grade broken japonica, West New Japonica, and New Yang Du Tuanjian saw increases of one or two cents. Bianyuan, Dongxin Japonica, aged Yangjian, premium Jian, and early thin-husked rice prices remained stable.</p>

<p>Hunan rice is scarce, and the market outlook is good... Beijing Xian rice has arrived in large quantities; the subsequent market is flat and soft. Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market saw lively purchases from Fujian suppliers. Guangdong suppliers also expressed interest. Because the province levies taxes on foreign rice, future demand must rely on Du Ke Xian rice from the Yangtze River region. However, they are currently observing. Some Guangdong merchants are purchasing in Wuhu and Jiujiang and plan to go directly to Hunan to purchase. Therefore, they have not yet started in the local market. Furthermore, after the previous surge in customer Xian rice prices, owners are hoping for higher prices and are unwilling to sell cheaply. However, at these prices, transportation is not cost-effective. Yesterday, only Fujian inquired about customer Xian rice. Quanzhou suppliers only purchased new Nanjing rough rice. New machine-milled rice was entirely purchased by Fuzhou. Sales of high-grade new Hunan machine-milled Jing rice opened at seven yuan, six jiao, and two fen. Medium grade opened at seven yuan, four jiao, to seven yuan, two jiao, and a half. A total of 610 packages were sold. Although the quality was not as solid as previous sales, prices rose by about ten cents. Additionally, 210 packages of Beijing machine-milled Xian rice sold for six yuan, nine jiao. Four hundred packages of Nanjing rough Xian rice sold for six yuan, one jiao, and a half, to six yuan, one jiao. Both Nanjing car-machine-milled Xian rice are overstocked. The market is less favorable than Hunan machine-milled rice, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, all months showed signs of continued weakness. Although the price of foreign wheat quoted Chicago at a good six or seven jiao, and Canada at a good one jiao, most people, due to sluggish sales and the ever-increasing stockpiles of flour at various factories, this situation is entirely factual. The so-called supply exceeding demand has created a surplus and backlog. The result in the morning was that all months fell by about one and a half cents. By the time the afternoon opened, it was still weak initially. Later, due to the Tianjin suppliers offsetting shortages and purchasing standard flour, and Nanyang suppliers also making slight transactions, market speculation followed. Distant months rebounded quickly due to limited factory output, but considering the facts, it is feared that it is still a situation of short-term briskness and long-term weakness. As a result, the current month is still up one fen and two li and a half compared to the previous day. October to December remained unchanged. January was up seven li and a half. February was up one fen.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Futures Wheat: Initially Flat, Then Stable <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, presented an initially flat and then stable appearance. With foreign wheat prices quoted with Chicago up six or seven jiao and Canada up one jiao, the market atmosphere was relatively flat at the initial opening. Later, due to very scarce exports and very active imports, the market atmosphere showed a slight improvement. As for the goods delivered in the current month, it is heard that there are already eighteen cars, which have been verified as compliant. As for the intentions of those in the industry, everyone believes that wheat arrivals are limited and does not see a weak trend. However, with the sluggish sales of flour, it is feared that recovery will be difficult. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, October-November were up two fen, and December was up two fen. The current wheat market is still active, and prices are stable. Kai Yaowan wheat opened at three yuan, nine jiao, secondary to seven jiao and a half. Puzhen wheat opened at three yuan, six jiao. Wuhu wheat opened at three yuan, four jiao, six fen, secondary to four jiao, one fen. Heqiao wheat opened at three yuan, five jiao. Zhenjiang wheat opened at three yuan, four jiao, eight fen. Qintong wheat opened at three yuan, seven jiao, nine fen, totaling five thousand packages.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the miscellaneous grains market, new train yellow soybeans have entered the market. 300 packages of Yaowan goods arrived, the quality is quite good, purchased by the local merchants, and price opened at four yuan, six jiao. Furthermore, over 30 packages of Bengbu soybeans near Zhengyangguan arrived. The goods are acceptable, but there are many hardened beans, the local merchants did not approve the sample, so no transaction was made. Although the source of new soybeans from Jiangbei continues, the quantity is not large, so the market is stable. Jiujiang soybeans have also increased due to scarcity, rising by nearly two jiao compared to the lowest price. Hankou soybeans have also increased by a few cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a drop in the benchmark price, but the Dutch exchange rate narrowed, and the customs rate remained firm.

<p>New Mian Red Dates: The first batch of dozens of packages arrived, opening at ten yuan, the quality is quite good. Initially, North specifications sold for nine yuan and a half, then rose to ten yuan. According to a Tianjin telegram, local prices rose by nearly one yuan, and the Shanghai market opened at ten yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Unified Hand Black Dates: The first batch of new goods arrived opening at nine yuan, later sold at nine yuan, two jiao. Yesterday, according to a Qingdao telegram, local prices slightly loosened, so the subsequent market may see a decline.</p>

<p>(New York Hua Silk Rebounds Twenty Yuan) The New York raw silk market, due to the prevalence of inflation rumors, saw a sharp rise in various commodity prices. The current silk price has also risen by nearly two gold yuan (per pound). Therefore, the Hua silk price has also rebounded by twenty yuan in domestic currency compared to the previous weekend. Silk sales are gradually becoming active.</p>
<p>(Anhui White Silk Shipped Seventy Pieces) Anhui Province Muzhen reverse car white silk since seeing the new, transporting it to Shanghai is quite bustling. The Jiangda steamboat recently shipped seventy pieces from Datong Wuhu again.</p>
<p>(Man-made fibers' clearances turn firm) As foreign exchange contracts, the price of rayon has turned firm, and clearances remain good. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants purchased twenty-four boxes of Feima Samsung Red Bell and other brands of spot goods, priced from one hundred and seventy-three yuan, seven jiao and a half to one hundred and sixty-five yuan, five jiao net.</p>
<p>(European and American silk sales pending) In the European and American markets, the sales of Hua silk factories are gradually becoming active. Regrettably, the silk prices relayed by telegram still differ from the Shanghai market by fifty yuan, and the base is too dry, making negotiations difficult to finalize. Sales are pending. Yesterday, only Renji and others imported fifty packages of white factory warp and twenty packages of yellow factory warp, with prices remaining firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, merchants such as Jinlong Yongxing from Wuyuan Tunxi began purchasing high-grade Zhuang Zhenmei green tea from both routes. Among them, the best quality goods from Tunxi's famous tea makers, due to the lack of inventory and scarce sources, have already raised market prices to one hundred and forty yuan, up three or four yuan from the previous period. The sales of Gongxi Zhucha have also become more active. The price of Wuyuan East Road's excellent tea leaves is also becoming firmer. However, the market for medium and low-grade tea remains weak. Transactions for other items such as Zhen Xiu Mei are also becoming scarce, it is said.</p>

<p>Hengdi tin from Hunan has been scarce in Shanghai because the Hankou suppliers' demand is huge. Therefore, it is very difficult for local colleagues to purchase this product. However, in recent weeks, it is heard that the tin market in Hankou is sluggish, and the money market is tight. Therefore, the suppliers have no choice but to ship it to Shanghai for sale. As a result, the arrival of goods in Shanghai has been quite strong in recent days. The benchmark price is low due to the poor environment. The current market price is one hundred and eighty-nine yuan per dan, about two yuan lower than before. It is reported that over a hundred strips have been opened in the market in recent days.</p>

<p>Introductory Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e303">Confucius Was a Food Expert <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>Confucius was learned and all-knowing. Speaking of food and drink, plain water and simple meals seem very casual. But when you look into it, he really wasn't willing to be careless in the slightest. Things that were cut, if the shape wasn't right, he wouldn't eat them. (If it's not cut correctly, he won't eat.) He wouldn't eat vegetables without sauce. (If he can't get his sauce, he won't eat.) He wouldn't eat wine and meat casually bought on the market. (Cheap wine and market dried meat, he won't eat.) No matter what dish, ginger was indispensable. (He doesn't remove ginger from his meals.) When I was young and reading the "Village" chapter of the Analects, I often said to my teacher: "This Confucius is so particular about what he eats, no wonder Mrs. Confucius had a hard time serving this husband!" Everyone would burst into laughter. Look at the many things Confucius said, they are all inexplicably wonderful.</p>
<p>(1) "Food should be meticulously prepared, and minced meat should be finely chopped." Eating means eating hygienic rice. In other words, you have to eat some coarser rice. Brown rice is rich in vitamins, so rice is better the coarser it is. It can be seen that rice is based on the principle of coarseness. But when you go to someone's house to eat, then it is the time to make do, and one cannot dislike refined rice. In fact, how could he have liked eating refined rice? Coarse fish and big pieces of meat bring happiness to the mouth. It can be seen that the focus of cuisine is on proper cooking. If it is too small, it will never be refreshing or satisfying. But when going to someone's house for social occasions, one can only tolerate it and not dislike it. In fact, how could he have liked fine cuisine? (2) "Fish that is rotten or meat that is spoiled, he will not eat; food that is discolored, he will not eat; food that smells bad, he will not eat." Confucius's diet was extremely hygienic. If the fish was rotten, the meat was spoiled, or the dish was discolored or tasted bad, he would absolutely refuse to eat it. Now there are many restaurants that casually sell things that have been left overnight, truly deserving of death. If Confucius knew, he would definitely tell the little boys to beat the drums and attack them. (3) "If it's not properly cooked, he won't eat it." Confucius paid great attention to the art of cooking. Too raw is of course bad, but too cooked is also not good. A good bowl of vegetables, half-raw, is of course difficult to swallow, but if it is cooked until it is mushy and turns yellow, the vitamins have already been lost, and he would definitely shake his head and not eat it.</p>
<p>(4) "He does not eat what is out of season." Eating ice cream in winter or chrysanthemum hot pot in summer is of course out of season. There are also things like melons in April and May, and mooncakes in September and October, either the season hasn't arrived or it has already passed, and he wouldn't eat them.</p>
<p>In short, this Confucius was an extremely economical, extremely hygienic, and extremely scientific food expert. I think Mr. Xi, the boss of Guanshengyuan, as well as the managers and chefs in restaurants, should all study the Analects, or perhaps their products will be more popular.</p>
<p>Domestic Foods</p>
<h3 id="e304">Talking About Domestic Fish <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Bo</p>
<p>"Fish" occupies a very important position in people's diet, with its freshness, deliciousness, and tenderness, its flavor is endless. Depending on individual preferences, cooking methods vary. There are also many local specialties, such as Songjiang perch, Yellow River carp, Jingjiang pufferfish, Jiading turtles, and Taihu triangular peaks (a type of carp), which are particularly talked about. "Fish" is delicious, as everyone agrees, the saying "big chunks of fish, big chunks of meat" shows that "fish" is considered a delicacy by gluttons. And the protein, vitamins, and lipids it contains are equal to or higher than those of duck, pork, chicken eggs, so its nutritional value is evident. Moreover, fish is rich in moisture, and the softness of its meat far exceeds that of birds and beasts. Not only can cooking save time, but digestion is also very quick, and the absorption of nutrients is easy. My country has the longest coastline and the widest fishing grounds, plus the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River three major rivers cross several provinces, with many rivers and ports, and lakes and marshes scattered like stars. The abundance of fish is unparalleled in the world. The amount of supply is naturally in sight. The value of fish (in Shanghai), apart from some expensive varieties, is about the same as that of vegetables during the fishing season for small yellow croaker, large yellow croaker, blackfish, and ribbonfish, as well as various sturgeons. Fish has various conditions: nutritious, easy to digest, suitable for preferences, and affordable, and it is indeed a very important appetite-promoting side dish. Moreover, it is produced in our country's territorial waters and the Yangtze River. It is indeed a genuine national product. However, in recent years, "fish" of foreign origin have been mixed into the country from time to time. If the fence is built tight, wild dogs cannot get in!</p>
<p>Since we know that fish is important to people's lives, we should attach importance to the domestic fishing industry. Currently, my country's fishing industry is coveted by powerful neighbors. Foreign vessels intrude into our territorial waters and overfish, causing fish produced in our country to become imports. Although there are many national products in seafood and salted fish, they are also under pressure from foreign goods. The rivers in the interior should also be thoroughly investigated, (Japanese people come to China every year to investigate freshwater fisheries. Previously, there was Kensuke Kishigami investigating fish diseases and deaths in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan) with intentions of aggression, ambitious. If we do not take remedial measures, sooner or later we will sigh, "No fish to eat." When purchasing goods at national products companies and eating fish, readers should pay attention to whether the fish was caught by Chinese fishermen, very important, very important.</p>
<h3 id="e305">Understanding Tofu <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Tofu, this is a purely domestic food and drink product. A Chinese student, Mr. So-and-so, once made countless profits from it overseas. Its history: the founder was Liu An, King of Huainan. Its raw materials are water and soybeans. Soybeans are plants rich in protein, so tofu's nutrition, though slightly inferior to meat and eggs, is superior to milk. The absorption of protein is (96%) for tofu, (93%) for milk, and (98%) for meat and eggs. A piece of tofu weighing two kilograms has a life force of 128 grams of protein, 68 grams of fat, 14 grams of carbohydrates, and can generate 1190 calories, nearly half of the daily calorie requirement. Therefore, tofu is a truly nourishing food. Moreover, the "Compendium of Materia Medica" also says that tofu, in addition to being clear and lovely, can broaden the middle, benefit qi, harmonize the spleen and stomach, eliminate distension, remove turbid air in the large intestine, and clear heat and blood, so tofu also acts as a medicine.</p>
<p>Although tofu is our daily food, many people may not know its method of preparation. Actually, it is very simple, but to make it white and tender, the effort is not easy. First, soak soybeans in water for ten hours, or four or five hours in summer. Then, grind them into a fine powder and slurry with water in a mill. Filter it with cloth to obtain raw soy milk and soybean residue. Soybean residue can be used as pig feed. Put the raw soy milk into a wok and simmer it over low heat. When it reaches over 300 degrees, the milk is cooked. A thin layer can be obtained on the surface of the wok, called tofu skin, which is the most nourishing among tofu products. Cooked milk is soy milk. Add gypsum to the milk to coagulate it into soft tofu, or tofu pudding. Pour it into a cloth bag and squeeze it with external force to obtain dried tofu, dried bean curd shreds, and other products. The amount of water it contains depends on the amount of squeezing force applied. If alum instead of gypsum is used to coagulate it, the poured tofu is tofu. Tofu is best made tender, so a pressure of about 80 kilograms is suitable. If it exceeds that, it will become old, and if it is less, the tofu will not set. The duration of time must also be noted. The above is a general outline of the method of making tofu. There are other recipes for eating it, so there is no need to say more. Speaking of its nature, in addition to the above-mentioned effects, its surface can be praised for being soft and white, and its taste is truly noble compared to the sea food from enemy countries. Fellow countrymen, may you never forget this completely domestic, economical, and nourishing food.</p>

<h3 id="e306">Talking About National Products Foods <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major elements of life, and food ranks second, showing its importance. Now there are many people who, when they talk about food, always think of eating big dishes or foreign things, as if not eating foreign things is related to their own face. This is really a wrong idea, and we should correct it. We are Chinese and should use Chinese goods. Of course, eating is no exception. Since we are Chinese, we should eat national products foods and never have the idea of valuing foreign goods and belittling domestic products. You must know that the imperialist aggression against China is meticulous. In terms of food alone, a lot of money is taken away from them every year. Therefore, we should quickly wake up. Everyone should develop the habit of using national products this year. That is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>As for national products foods, there are really many now, and they have also made a lot of progress compared to before. Compared with foreign goods, they are on par and keeping pace. Take Guanshengyuan's foods, everything is domestic: mooncakes, fruit preserves, minced meat... There are many items, too many to list. The things are good and the prices are not expensive. We should rise up and promote them. So that domestic food becomes better every day.</p>
<p>There are also biscuits from Taikang Company, etc., which are all authentic domestic foods, known to everyone. Why shouldn't we eat domestic foods?</p>
<p>In short, in the National Products Year, we should use Chinese goods. Now we can change these two sentences for the time being: "In the National Products Year, we should eat Chinese goods." Readers, do you think this is right?</p>

<h3 id="e307">Advocating Domestic Horticulture Cooperation <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhong</p>
<p>The market is full of various kinds of imported fresh fruits, as well as fruit juice, jam, and other fruit products. The annual outflow of funds is more than huge sums. In 1920, I also founded a six-mu orchard in my hometown. On the one hand, it was for my own interest, but soon I gained rich profits. So I immediately attracted people's attention. In just a few years, orchards could be found everywhere nearby.</p>
<p>But it became a flash in the pan, just like Chinese people starting a new business. This prosperous phenomenon of the emerging horticultural industry eventually declined and fell due to inconvenient transportation, blocked sales channels, poor cultivation, inferior products, and lack of attention to packaging and manufacturing. Fruit trees, which were once considered gold trees, are now cut down for fuel. Mu of orchards are still turned into crop fields. How long ago did this change occur? Looking back on the past, I can't help but feel the changes in time!</p>
<p>Is the horticultural industry at its end? But aren't thousands of imported oranges, tangerines, coconuts, as well as semi-finished and finished products such as raisins, fruit juice, and jam, filling our markets everywhere? This is definitely not the end of horticulture, but the decline of the horticulturalists themselves!</p>
<p>To save the current trend of decline in the domestic horticultural industry, of course, this cannot be ignored. We can only find the source of the disease, prescribe the right medicine, which is roughly nothing more than: one, improving cultivation methods, two, engaging in sorting and packaging, three, finding ways to facilitate transportation and open up markets, and four, establishing factories for manufacturing, storage, and extraction.</p>
<p>But how easy is this to say? Without a large amount of capital and without considerable talent, it is impossible to do it. To adapt to the current environment, I believe that the (cooperation) method is the most suitable.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, we must immediately gather all comrades who are engaged in horticulture or interested in horticulture and organize a (horticultural production and sales cooperative) to concentrate our capital and talent to jointly engage in the improvement and development of horticultural production, transportation, sales, and manufacturing. In this way, we may be able to save one ten-thousandth of the huge annual outflow of funds on imported fruits.</p>
<p>New Industry Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e308">A Record of Yangfen Manufacturer Liang Daoyuan <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Bai Ju</p>
<p>Yangfen, sold in grocery stores in the market, is made from seaweed called agar, which is produced in the sea. This powder is a specialty of Japan. Annual sales to the Chinese mainland are nearly millions of yuan, accounting for an important part of its country's exports. During the Republic of China era, Mr. Liang Daoyuan from my hometown, after investigating the Haiyang County area, found that it produced a very rich amount of agar. The fishermen did not know how to make powder and abandoned it. Therefore, Mr. Liang prepared funds and went to Japan to learn the method of making powder. He soon learned it and returned to China. He immediately founded the Rushan Yangfen Company in Haiyang and personally supervised the construction. The powder produced was pure white and better than Japanese goods. Just as he was promoting and developing, there were unscrupulous elements among the shareholders who intended to seize power and engage in private interests. Mr. Liang resigned in extreme anger. However, the company was also dissolved as a result. Later, in the winter of 1915, I met Mr. Liang in Tianjin. He still intended to start collecting capital and set up a factory again. I ran around and advocated for it, but in the end, because I was of low status and my words carried little weight, it was called off due to lack of responses. A few years ago, I read in the newspaper that Mr. Liang had already set up a factory in Jinan. It is said that the capital was provided by the government. However, Mr. Liang is always enthusiastic about China's industry, and he is frugal, capable, and particularly skilled. Moreover, this kind of industry is a pioneering concept in the country. The development of his business can be predicted.</p>

<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Prelude</p>
<p>I live in the countryside of Jiangwan, in a tile-roofed house up and down, facing a vegetable garden of over an acre. Although it is not as crowded as the Shanghai shikumen, a small living room is where the children roll around and jump; my wife sews and mends; and I write and read, with no other place to go. Is such a place worthy of being called a studio? However, literati like to put on a show and always inscribe a studio name to amuse themselves. I cannot be an exception. Should I inscribe about wind, flowers, snow, and moon? People would ridicule it as decadent. Should I inscribe about expelling the barbarians and honoring China? I dare not boast of such a big mouth. After thinking again and again, I had an idea! The scenery in front of me can be borrowed as the studio name. Small characters (family four days, all wearing Dayou clothes: home-cooked vegetables, often chewed, then call it (Bushu Studio)!) Gentlemen, don't underestimate these two words, Bushu, genuinely domestic products, completely local products, with no counterfeiting or mixing at all! What kind of writing should be written in this studio? Please see the text below:</p>
<h3 id="e310">Zongzi Candy and Chocolate <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>When children have nothing to do, they always like to chew on things. They don't want sour or spicy things, they just reach out their little hands and ask for candy. When they are crying so hard that tears and snot are flowing, as long as you put a piece of candy in their mouths, they will turn from crying to laughing, giggling with their little mouths, jumping around and playing. Candy is really the only lover of children!</p>
<p>Whenever Mao Tou from the east neighborhood cried, his parents would spend a copper coin to buy a zongzi candy and put it in his mouth, and he would leave smiling. The young master from the west neighborhood chewed chocolate all day long. According to his nanny, chocolate costs seven jiao and a half a pound, and he chews one or two pounds a day!</p>
<p>Time passes very quickly. In an instant, Mao Tou, who ate zongzi candy, wears cloth clothes; chews on vegetable roots, and has risen from an apprentice to the manager of a store. The young master from the west, who eats chocolate, wears a suit; eats foreign food; goes to dance halls, and has fallen into the group of "thieves". Everything starts from family education. Don't despise this zongzi candy! Therefore, Hu wrote a song:</p>
<p>Zongzi candy, sweet and delicious, you don't need silver to buy it, children treasure and cherish it. This is a domestic product; this is our own people, keep one in your mouth often, and spring will be in the room.</p>
<p>Chocolate, the taste is new; fragrance lingers on the lips, it is truly a treasure on the table. First, I sigh at the expensive price; second, I sigh that it is a foreign product. When it enters the mouth, it also disappears, and the money turns into dust.</p>

<p>Local Products Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e311">Ham <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Jingjia</p>
<p>Speaking of ham, everyone thinks of Jinhua. Jinhua's ham is indeed very famous. I am fortunate to be born in a place that produces ham, so at least, seeing ham won't make me consider it a treasure like people from other places.</p>
<p>Although ham is said to be produced in Jinhua, the production areas should also include Dongyang and Yiwu. There, ham is the largest product, and the amount shipped out each year is countless! In recent years, other businesses have been losing money, only the ham business is relatively good, so there are even more people doing ham business!</p>
<p>Even though it's just a small ham, it takes a lot of time, effort, and strength. First, the pig leg must be cut off, then it is cured with salt. It also needs to be sun-dried and washed, and the bad fatty meat on the leg has to be cut off. It really takes a lot of effort.</p>
<p>The taste of ham is truly indescribable. Just the bright red color is enough to make people drool.</p>
<p>Of course, other places also have cured legs, but the taste is always better with Jinhua ham. This is not because Jinhua has some special "feng shui" for producing ham, it is simply because the pigs in that area are raised well. There, raising pigs is the biggest side income for farmers. On the one hand, they rely on pig manure for fertilizer, and on the other hand, they can earn money. They don't raise pigs casually; the pigs' feed is even better than people's food. Barley, beans, sweet potato leaves, etc., are common feed. Many families mix glutinous rice or other human food into the pigs' feed. Therefore, because of the different feed, the meat of the pigs there is somewhat different, so the taste of the ham is more delicious.</p>

<p>Wuxi gets the beauty of mountains and rivers. The man-made specialty, oil gluten, has a round outline, is moist and soft, and has a unique flavor when cooked properly. Visitors to Wuxi must buy it. Wuxi Sanle Company also has exquisitely packaged canned gluten, which will not spoil for a long time. It is especially delicious as a side dish.</p>
<h3 id="e314">Meat Bones <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>(Everyone knows to buy Wuxi meat bones to eat). The fame and deliciousness of meat bones can be imagined. However, to get fine-skinned, white-fleshed, well-cooked spareribs, the one from "Liang Tou Sanfeng Bridge" is second to none. Other meat shops such as Dashiqiao Tantoushu are also good.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Osmanthus Chestnuts <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>The golden breeze sends coolness, and the fragrance of osmanthus gradually permeates. Wuxi's famous osmanthus chestnuts are about to hit the market. The golden yellow flesh is tender and smaller than the Liangxiang chestnuts. In recent years, there have been many imitations. Real osmanthus chestnuts are produced in front of the Niangniang Temple in Huishan. The price is relatively high, costing one yuan for two catties, which may not be enough. Demand exceeds supply, so it is naturally expensive. If we take good varieties and cultivate and produce them well, their richness and nutrition can defeat cod liver oil and wheat flakes.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Honey Lin Aldehyde <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>A kind of honey lin aldehyde in Wuxi wineries is sweet, moist, and not dry, clear and lovely. Drinking too much will only cause slight drunkenness. It is enough to defeat imported wines and beers. It is a pity that the people of Wuxi do not decorate and develop it, and sit idly by while the rights and interests are taken away, which is truly regrettable!</p>
<h3 id="e317">Students' Domestic Breakfasts <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>The extravagance of student life is recognized by all walks of life, especially in Shanghai. Now, I want to say based on facts that student life is not necessarily extravagant, especially when it comes to breakfast. The food that students eat is mostly economical for the common people. Of course, these foods and beverages are completely domestic products. Let the reporter introduce them one by one on the left.</p>
<p>(1) Baked sweet potatoes: This food is a genuine local product, a pure domestic product. Its nutrition is known for being rich in carbohydrates. (2) Cifàn: Cifàn is made by steaming glutinous rice over water. It is glutinous and rich in nutrition. When selling it, the scattered grains must be gathered and kneaded with a towel to form a melon shape. Usually, forty or fifty cents will get you a dense ball that is enough to fill you up.</p>
<p>(3) Fried steamed buns: They are a very small kind of steamed bun, worth twenty cents. The shell is made of flour, and the filling is minced meat or bean paste, and fried in oil until cooked. It is quite delicious and filling. (4) Soup noodles: This is a well-known domestic food and beverage. Although the price may be higher at times, it is quite cheap in itself. Sometimes, a dozen copper coins can get you full.</p>
<p>(5) Tofu soup: The value of tofu soup is well known to the Chinese people. It is not only nutritious, but the various items mentioned above are all food, while tofu is a beverage. Forty cents for tofu soup plus a copper coin for sugar is cheap and good, isn't it great? In addition to the various breakfast foods and beverages mentioned above, other items such as milk, coffee, bread, and Western pastries are not economical foods and beverages, and are mostly foreign goods. Even the porridge that we must have is not dared to be listed, because we don't know if it is Annam rice or Siamese rice.</p>
<h3 id="e318">Mooncake Assembly <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Mooncakes are the most historically valuable and poetic thing in our country. When the new moon hangs high in the sky, and the brand-new signboards in the streets reflect "New Mooncakes on the Market", we meet with it after a long separation. Once a year, we naturally feel extra close and lovely.</p>
<p>At this time, the China National Products Company, our national product headquarters, also held a large (Mooncake Assembly). It brings together the most famous mooncakes from various places, mainly divided into (Ning style), (Su style), and (Guang style), with hundreds of different sizes and types of fillings. Now, for the convenience of customers to choose and purchase, they are gathered in one place for evaluation, establishing an assembly, welcoming people from all walks of life to visit and purchase. It is truly an unprecedented initiative.</p>
<p>Everyone is enthusiastically promoting domestic food and beverages, but I especially hope that we eat more mooncakes, because mooncakes are purely domestic products and valuable specialties. At this time, looking at the bright moon and chewing on sweet mooncakes is both pleasant, cheap, and also considered promoting domestic food and beverages, so why not do it!</p>
<p>The picture below shows egg noodles, preserved tangerine peel plums, fresh orange juice, fruit dew, osmanthus powder, pasta, almond candy, and tank-shaped candies, etc., all of which are domestic foods and beverages that imitate foreign goods. They are of good quality and taste, and are widely sold, saving a lot of rights and interests every year.</p>
<p>The picture above shows seasonal domestic food (Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes), which are supplied domestically and internationally every year, and the number exported to foreign countries is also quite considerable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the taste is very sweet, and the price is extremely cheap, with each baked sweet potato costing about three or four copper coins.</p>
<h3 id="e319">Silver Ear Fungus Composition and Nourishing Effects <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Tiancheng</p>
<p>Every time autumn and winter arrive, we eagerly think about taking tonics, because we have been working hard for a year, and our bodies and minds are inevitably damaged. We should have something to nourish ourselves. The well-known tonics include ginseng, deer antler, bird's nest, and silver ear fungus. However, most people are ignorant of the specific nourishing qualities they contain and their effects, only knowing that ginseng nourishes qi, deer antler has a hot nature that separates it from ginseng, and bird's nest nourishes yin. They know relatively little about the effects of silver ear fungus, such as treating yin deficiency, weak constitution, lung disease, hemoptysis, chronic cough, gastritis, constipation, hemorrhoids, female metrorrhagia, leucorrhea, indigestion, and other symptoms. According to the effects of the above-mentioned tonics, ginseng, deer antler, and bird's nest are simple and have weak and biased effects. Silver ear fungus (i.e., white fungus) has the most uses and is most suitable for our consumption.</p>
<p>Although the uses of silver ear fungus are as described above, they are based on the word-of-mouth of elders, which is believed to be true. Now that science is flourishing, we should verify it in practice and know its composition before we can regard it as accurate.</p>
<p>The Sichuan stores in this city are famous for specializing in Sichuan silver ear fungus. The store previously invited Hu Zejun of the Chinese Science Society to conduct accurate scientific verification on the silver ear fungus produced from its own mountain fields in Sichuan. The results of the verification showed that silver ear fungus contains a large amount of fat, protein, *, *, iron, sodium, and other elements, and even more mucilage similar to gum arabic. Medical experts say that this mucilage has three major effects: (1) aids digestion, (2) replenishes blood, and (3) facilitates bowel movements (according to doctors during the European War, people who lost too much blood on the battlefield used 6% gum arabic and 0.7% salt added to distilled water to inject into blood vessels to fill the blood, with good results. Please refer to the book *Research on Sichuan Silver Ear Fungus* published by the Chinese Science Society).</p>
<p>It is said that Sichuan silver ear fungus can cure all diseases and prolong life if taken for a long time. Now, looking at the ingredients it contains, it is not an empty word. No food can simultaneously have the above three functions, and it is even more difficult to find in tonics. Now that silver ear fungus has all of them, it deserves the title of rare treasure.</p>
<p>It is found that the production area of silver ear fungus is not only Sichuan, but also Guizhou and Hubei provinces. Due to the different geographical climates, the efficacy seems to be less than that of Sichuan. Therefore, sellers all call it Sichuan silver ear fungus.</p>
<h3 id="e320">Talking about Mooncakes <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— Zhizhong</p>
<p>The most fashionable domestic food on the market now is none other than mooncakes. As long as you trust your feet, you can see Mid-Autumn Festival mooncake signs as big as fists everywhere, hanging high in the sky, swaying in the wind. Their smooth and round shape, like a full moon, and their sweet, soft, and delicious taste all make people associate with them. Since mooncakes have such allure, the bustling crowd is carrying them, large and small, vying to buy them, and taking pleasure in enjoying them. Since mooncakes are so warmly welcomed by the general public, manufacturers and sellers are constantly improving them to meet the needs, and the sales of mooncakes are therefore becoming more and more prosperous. Just taking the Xinghua Restaurant as an example, the number sold every Mid-Autumn Festival reaches more than 100,000. If we add up the sales of the whole city and the whole country, isn't the number even more staggering? It is said that the reason why mooncakes sell so well is actually a manifestation of the Chinese people's love for peace, because mooncakes symbolize reunion. If so, when the Chinese people are enjoying mooncakes in peace, they hope that they will try to imagine the 30 million compatriots in Northeast China, and whether they can also enjoy mooncakes as calmly as we do. Furthermore, think about whether all parts of our country can be full of people, every family reunited, and eat these mooncakes peacefully year after year.</p>
<h3 id="e321">Selection Criteria for Food and Beverages <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Chunmei</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, I am catering to a few words that I want to express in my heart.</p>
<p>Since our country opened trade with the East and West, it is when the East wind has gradually come, and European customs have come one after another. Now, in places where traffic is convenient, they all have their footprints. Instead, everything original to this country has been overly shelved. This is also a major mistake of our Chinese nation, which is the main reason for the degradation of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to food and beverages, everyone always thinks it is fashionable or curious and spends a small amount of money. In fact, they don't know that most people are suffering from this pure strange disease, filling thousands of tons of sea-going empty holds with huge and staggering numbers, transporting them abroad for them to build, convenient transportation, and sophisticated and sophisticated toxic weapons, to bestow on the silkworms of the autumn-leaf-like land, to poison and intoxicate...to the point of extinction!</p>
<p>For example, the commonly eaten agar-agar, oriental pickled fish, and all kinds of fast-food Western foods are all unnecessary to enjoy! Even if there is a time when we need to share a table with Westerners, it is more convenient and easier to eat fresh national dishes in China, and I admit that it will absolutely not hinder any event or emotion. Speaking of foreign countries, fortunately, there are only a few after all, but within the possible range, we still have to chew on national dishes. Furthermore, to the adults and gentlemen, comprador classes, foreign company employees, and others in the country, please take this (psychic agent) from me, and discover the national responsibility of the entire bankrupt Chinese nation, save, save your own safety in the future!</p>
<p>In conclusion, to sum up: if Western dishes have one kind, our national dishes also have one kind, and even have two kinds, and I believe the taste of national dishes is more suitable for the stomach and delicious. Why eat this poisonous Western dish? The author here dares to advise everyone to adopt domestic goods as the standard for food and beverages.</p>
<p>The picture below shows domestic brandy, blood-enriching wine, fresh orange juice, Yantai beer, and other most famous high-end domestic beverages, which are strong enemies of imported goods.</p>
<p>The various foods in the left picture are all produced in Sichuan, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Hangzhou, and other places, and are famous local products made using scientific methods. Food companies all sell them. Short news: Yangshupu Gongqin Iron Factory, which is known for manufacturing domestic round nails, has been famous throughout the country. Since it began manufacturing wire fences last year, there have been more and more adopters of seaside residential gardens and ball fields every day. There is also a kind of machine safety net, which is the most essential device for industrial safety. Recently, domestic factories everywhere have also been ordering them one after another, and they are rushing to manufacture them day and night. This summer, Mr. Huang Jiepu, the manager of the factory, in order to adapt to social needs, manufactured more than 30 kinds of iron mesh footrests and various supplies for offices and homes, which are all sold in the Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun companies.</p>

<h3 id="e322">Books for Women to Read <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Recently, there are too many books for children to read. Regardless of the quality, just looking at the quantity, we can say: "Our children are blessed."</p>
<p>However, I think we still lack a type of book: books for women to read. Originally, women are also people, and there is no need to separate everything from men ("bridges go to bridges, roads go to roads"). However, due to traditional relationships, the footsteps of today's women mostly cannot directly walk on the single-plank bridge, so we must build another road for them. The facts are there, and no one will deny it. However, our cultural circles do not seem to have noticed this. If they can't cross the bridge, they are left on the other shore. This kind of laissez-faire policy will inevitably hinder the development of culture. As Chugawa Hakuson said well: "The relationship between men and women in cultural life is like a three-legged race. No matter how well one side can run, it will not succeed if the other side cannot run."</p>
<p>Previously, there were indeed periodicals such as *New Woman* and *Women's Magazine*, as well as the series of books from the *Women's Issues Research Association*, but they were all selected to conduct academic research on women's issues. It is difficult to know how these books affect women, but as far as I can see, it seems that men read these kinds of books more, and the impact is also greater on men. Now, let's not talk about that for now. I just want to say that in addition to these kinds of books, women also need a kind that provides general knowledge in a special style, so that slightly educated women can never tire of reading it, gradually improve their insights, and cultivate their understanding and judgment of things.</p>
<p>Just like with children, I think a special style is also needed for women.</p>
<p>As for the general modern ladies, it is still best to provide multi-angled love novels. It is said that the French perfume king Coty (François Coty) started as a perfume merchant entirely by mastering the three principles of women's psychology: First, the name of the perfume must be pleasing to the ear; second, the bottle must be exquisite; third, the price must be expensive. Our publishers can follow these three principles: First, the name of the book must be pleasing to the ear; second, the cover must be exquisite; third, the price must be!! No, this one must be modified: the price must be cheap. Because our modern ladies want to save their money to buy expensive perfumes.</p>
<p>In the magazine called "Joke", I saw these words: "Jin Yan, a star who is loved by many ladies because of his gentle smiling face and various conditions suitable for women of the leisure class, should change his role after *Mother's Light* and give the ladies meaningful guidance and lead them to the path of light. Ladies have some idol concepts, and they will not leave Jin Yan because of his changing role, so he does not need to deliberately abandon them."</p>
<p>This is also a way of putting new wine in old bottles, which our love novelists have tried, but the success seems to be far less than that of *Mother's Light*. There are other reasons for this, which I think are unrelated to the essence of the method. The author of *Spring Silkworms*, in a sense, is also a user of this method, but the influence of this author is mostly still on men. For women, another kind of writer is needed. This section is just about literature.</p>
<h3 id="e323">Street Sketch <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, XX Street is, as usual, crowded like a small fish pond with many fish. People pass through it diagonally, some stopping to look at the shop entrances, others walking forward like rushing records, stumbling and bumping.</p>
<p>Because it is just the beginning of the semester, the streets are full of students. The male students' light-colored jackets or turned-down collar shirts, young and light footsteps, are mixed with laughter. The female students' white shirts and short skirts fluttered smartly in the west wind, and some had triangular badges hanging on their collars. Rickshaw pullers approached them:</p>
<p>"Want a rickshaw, Panmen?" If they guessed correctly, they smiled with their mouths open. In the bookstores, female students asked for discounts in sharp voices, picking out some exquisite new-style stationery. They also always forgot to go to foreign goods stores to buy some Dream Cream or Simon Cream. Young hearts always love beauty, although they sometimes asked, "Isn't this soap box Japanese?"</p>
<p>Advertisements for "Tianjin Liangxiang" and "Various Mooncakes on the Market" attracted many people, who stretched out their hands and waited patiently. Beggars chased behind the men, shouting, "Young master, cultivate blessings and longevity, go abroad in the future, become an official..." Behind the women, they said, "Do good deeds, miss, marry a rich and powerful chairman, military commander in the future..." Disappointed, they turned around and mumbled, "Don't you want luck!"</p>
<p>The traffic police stood at the crossroads, waving their batons, sometimes knocking on the rickshaw awnings. When they were in a bad mood, they grabbed a few rickshaw cushions and dragged them to the police booth. The rickshaw pullers showed pitiful but angry eyes, and ran away before the baton slipped onto their backs. The wheels rattled on the cobblestone streets.</p>
<p>But a city without trams and cars is always quiet. The bells and horns of chartered rickshaws were drowned out by the mixed voices of the people, becoming such a vague and noisy piece. There was no shocking stimulation. The sounds released by the radio were also ordinary, mostly storytelling or songs like "Baby Wants to Sleep."</p>
<p>A group of people disappeared into the streets and alleys, and another group of people poured out from the streets and alleys. The cool autumn breeze carried the fragrance of women, and everyone felt a slightly drunk and refreshed mood.</p>
<h3 id="e324">Autumn <a href="#e324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night, the rain sound was monotonously pattering, and the wind was calling whirringly at the corner of the house. "Autumn is here again," I suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>The glass window was trembling like this, the lamp was silently silent, and a triangular small room was rippling with the desolate taste of the new autumn night. I lay down, lying down so that my bones felt sore everywhere. This is the usual state of rheumatoid arthritis patients on rainy nights, which I didn't mind. I opened my hazy tired eyes and looked around, and everything around was so dead! Covered with a thin blanket, I felt a slight cold on my skin, and I was sure: "Autumn has indeed arrived in the world," and I knew this was the bleak autumn night.</p>
<p>Time is really flying fast like an arrow. I remember one hot summer evening, after watching a play performed by my friends at the Russian Little Theater, I left the theater late at night and went to a ship berthed at the Shiliupu Pier. That was a summer night with the moon shining brightly on the waves and the sea breeze blowing away the heat. I said goodbye to Shanghai, where I had lived for a long time, and to all my dear friends, and threw myself into the arms of my hometown, which I had not seen for seven years.</p>
<p>At that time, my heart contained the joy of fantasy and the bitterness of reality, which was the so-called bittersweet situation. On one side, I was always reluctant to leave Shanghai and my friends in Shanghai, and on the other side, I was looking forward to everything in my hometown. My mood on the way home was truly unspeakably contradictory, apprehensive, apprehensive, until I arrived home.</p>
<p>Naturally, after seven years of separation, it cannot be said that the appearance of my hometown has not changed at all. At least, it is a fact that there is an extra Zhongshan Park and a clock tower. Although the park is reconstructed and not very good: the clock on the clock tower is also inaccurate. This is the achievement of the so-called "construction" that the people of the whole county spent a lot of money to obtain after the revolution, according to the people of my hometown.</p>
<p>I wanted to take advantage of the leisure of this summer vacation to stroll around as much as I wanted, and I had already planned on the way home to visit various places of interest. Who knew that I didn't realize it in the end, because the disease entangled me again. I lay down almost every day without moving, and did nothing except occasionally go to the fields to see the farmers harvesting rice and turning waterwheels. I really tasted the pale taste of rural life, which often made me recall my childhood, and suddenly I returned to my original life.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a long summer vacation was spent silently in illness and boredom. It seemed that time was particularly short. In a flash, I fell into autumn again. At the same time, I bid farewell to my dear family and friends again, sitting on the boat that had taken me home, quietly floating with the merciless seawater to Shanghai, which I had not left for a long time. Because it had not been long since I left, Shanghai and I did not feel unfamiliar at all.</p>
<p>The road was full of signs for autumn sales, and the women had also changed into thin autumn clothes. The whole city smelled of autumn. "Autumn is here." This is thousands of times, and it will never deceive people.</p>
<p>Really! Now is the time when summer is going and autumn is coming, and people's moods are also changing from hot to gloomy! With this gloomy mood, I happened to encounter this merciless wind and rain, which made a few hints of gloom. People wandering in a foreign land really don't know how to be comfortable? This little heart was finally gripped by gloom, gripped tightly.</p>
<p>Autumn! Don't be gloomy anymore, how good it would be if it cleared up tomorrow! I prayed like this in a low voice!</p>
<p>However, the rain was still pattering outside the window, and the wind was still calling whirringly. Still, I was also worried about the gloom of tomorrow!</p>
<h3 id="e325">Organizing Books <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Let's start with a commonplace remark: the autumn air is cool after the rain, perfect weather for reading.</p>
<p>I've just moved, and my room is like a cage. It can't hold many books, but I still have four boxes in disarray, so I have to organize them myself.</p>
<p>The books are a mix of Chinese and Western, ranging from poetry, essays, novels, and the Bible, to Zuo Zhuan, Spring and Autumn Annals, and many works ending in "-ism", down to Jade Calendar Excerpts, Guanyin Precious Scrolls, Complete Book of Fortune Telling, and How to Write Letters Without Asking for Help. I have a little of everything. It makes me happy to bring these sages and scholars, and these charlatans trying to make a living, together in one place, spending dawn and dusk together.</p>
<p>So I began to organize.</p>
<p>Each of these books took its own stand, shouting and arguing loudly, showing off its own special skills to win my trust. Confucius advocated the way of the king, Zilu promoted military force, Dante sang of divine comedy, Shakespeare wrote grandly like a stingy miser, the ghost of impermanence catches people in broad daylight, Guanyin Bodhisattva saves all living beings, the fortune teller shakes his five fingers, calculating back and forth, and concludes that you have a good fate after all, which does not match the facts; Later, one is missing metal from the five elements of wood, water, fire, and earth, a lucky star shines high, and a decade of luck is ruined, causing one to exclaim in despair!</p>
<p>At this point, the fortune teller bore the brunt of the attack. Because I found his skills to be really poor. I decided to put the Complete Book of Fortune Telling and Evolution and Ethics together, so that he could get some Western education, learn a few ABCDs, and become Westernized in the meantime.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Confucius refused to accept this, spouting nonsense and claiming that this was "using barbarians to change Xia," and only a traitor would be so insane! This statement angered me so much that I plucked out all of his beard hairs, leaving not a single one. After staring closely, I found that he had turned into a pretty boy. Serves you right, who told you to be so fiercely moralistic!</p>
<p>Just then, my friend X came to visit. X is a graduate of a certain church university. After he came in and took a careful look, he quickly hid the Bible behind his back, and pointed to the Guanyin Precious Scrolls and said to me, "In the twentieth century, you are still so superstitious, aren't you afraid people will laugh their heads off?" I blushed with shame and suddenly realized my error. I scolded the Guanyin Bodhisattva severely, and she had to let her hair down, walk barefoot, cover her face and weep, and stride off towards the Flaming Mountains.</p>
<p>I repeatedly praised my friend X's achievements. X became complacent and bumped Shakespeare's knee. Shakespeare was furious and displayed his theatrical skills of using fake knives and spears, thrusting diagonally with a knife. Unexpectedly, he stabbed X in the backside. With a thud, the Bible fell to the ground, and (my friend) fell head over heels. All the books that had been organized were knocked over, and half a day's work was wasted.</p>
<p>Oh well! I'll wait a few days before organizing again.</p>
<h3 id="e326">Stimulation <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Bing</p>
<p>If there is one person, I think he must have moments of seeking stimulation | at least once or twice in his life. After Gou and Hao left, I suddenly felt lonely, not wanting to say a word all day, not wanting to see anyone, only wanting to be alone, eating alone and singing alone. However, it was too strange. When they were here, I felt too unfree, too troublesome, even just going out casually, they would ask:</p>
<p>"Bing, where are you going?"</p>
<p>As for drinking boiled water, eating candy, and eating peanuts, it goes without saying, they always gave me some first. One day I wanted to write a letter, and they also wanted to write in their diaries, but the small table was piled with things, and it was difficult to write, so I hated them a little: | | Leave, it would be great if you left.</p>
<p>But this thought only lasted for a moment, and I immediately realized my mistake.</p>
<p>| | They finally came here, and you spent more than half a month to welcome them. Why are you arguing over something as small as sesame seeds?</p>
<p>So, taking advantage of Gou asking me "Is it easy to write?", I hurriedly put on a smiling face and answered her:</p>
<p>"Easy to write, easy to write!"</p>
<p>Also, night was the time I hated the most.</p>
<p>In the small room, there was a bed made of a few pieces of wood and a small table, which was already so crowded that three people couldn't turn over, and adding a folding bed made it even more impenetrable. The folding bed was so bulky and difficult to handle, and sometimes three people couldn't manage it, and Hao and my hands were often cut by the nails. Therefore, I once hated them:</p>
<p>| | Leave, it would be great if you left.</p>
<p>But the dreaded day finally came, they really left!</p>
<p>The day before they were about to leave, although I was busy writing a few letters to ask them to take to Shanghai, my heart was very calm, as if they weren't going to leave. The telephone number of whether the sedan carriers were available didn't come, and I thought there was no hope.</p>
<p>| | They won't be able to leave, I'm just calling the sedan carriers to trick them.</p>
<p>I proudly and firmly believed. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e327">(Anti-War) and (War Preparation) Jian <a href="#e327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>Recently, news of both extremes are being simultaneously revealed in the same newspaper: one is that the World Anti-War Conference is closing in some location: the other is that the great powers are also scheming and struggling against each other, exerting themselves to prepare for war.</p>
<p>The representatives of the Anti-War Conference are being subjected to (detention) and (prohibition from landing) everywhere. The meeting place, (a slap in the face by the authorities of a certain concession): (the attitude of the National Government) is (still uncertain); whether or not they can obtain a "permit" for holding the meeting within the concession for the sake of Sir Eric Drummond's personal nationality and face is also (still uncertain), I'm afraid?</p>
<p>Turning around to look at the countries preparing for war, it is lively and extraordinarily tense: the United States wants to complete its warship plan, the Italian air force visits the United States, the French air force flies to the Soviet Union, Britain is rushing to build the Singapore naval base and making more fighter jets. The Soviet Union is even more on edge and confronts its neighboring countries, brandishing its swords. In addition, Japan, a nation that has gone war-mad, is increasing military spending, expanding its power, conducting air defense drills, and especially flaunting its naval maneuvers, being arrogantly invincible. Even the Soviet Union, with a different political system, is also busy with military preparations: small countries such as Belgium are also eager to build solid defense works on the border, filled with fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>On the anti-war front, it is almost impossible to find a place to meet, even though the earth is vast: on the war preparation front, the momentum is huge, and the air is towering. Although this defense force is heavily fortified and facing each other, if one compares the actual strengths, (anti-war) is like piling eggs against a boulder, using one's arms to stop a chariot, one weak and one strong, as different as sky and earth.</p>
<p>The full arsenal is in the hands of the bourgeoisie, that is certain. Because making or buying weapons (requires money), and one needs weapons to protect assets. The soldiers who shoot guns and fire cannons are merely seeking the bare minimum to live on, sacrificing themselves for others.</p>
<p>War can also be said to be the (robbery behavior) of a country. Behind the god of war stands a god of wealth | the economy, and the former must obediently follow the command of the latter. The economic conflicts between modern countries are becoming increasingly acute, quickly turning from economic war into gun and cannon war. In other words: modern warfare is about occupying colonies and seizing markets to absorb raw materials and sell finished goods, that's all there is to it. (Of course, this refers to direct wars between imperialist powers. The cases of weak countries accepting the instigation of imperialist powers and engaging in internecine warfare, such as the recent situation in Cuba... are another matter.)</p>
<p>Therefore, war creates opportunities for capitalists who manufacture or sell weapons, or other industrial magnates, to make a fortune: the laboring classes only suffer unemployment, displacement, and death... which can be regarded as a blessing from war, whether it is a victorious country or a defeated country. This is well demonstrated in the European War.</p>
<p>Speaking of the essence of war, it is indeed terrible and extremely cruel. (Wars lead to endless disasters), (war is dangerous and fraught with peril), whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, everyone deeply detests and opposes it. Only a few with ulterior motives advocate war. But it's useless: oppose as you may, war is still war. And as science develops, war machines become more sophisticated, killing more people and causing greater destruction, by hundreds of millions times more than in the past. What is the reason for this? According to Sun Yat-sen, the total world population is 1.5 billion, of which 1.25 billion are oppressed, and only 250 million are oppressors. The oppressors, of course, are the armed class | the military and police are employed and directed by them: the oppressed on the opposite side have no assets and are naturally the unarmed class. It is as clear as day that three-quarters of the unarmed class will fail when opposing one-quarter of the armed class; however, if (thought is power) is true, then the psychology of so many people attacking the psychology of so few will inevitably lead to ultimate victory; and it seems that this opportunity may be in the near future.</p>
<p>If we want to be people of the present era and possess some common sense, then everyone should stand on the side of (anti-war); however, we must not blindly follow the crowd with muddled thinking. Although war is bad, we must also distinguish its nature: for example, the American war for independence from Britain, the war to liberate black slaves that led to the American Civil War, and the revolutions of the Paris Commune in France and the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, all had great value in human history, and we painfully express our sympathy.</p>
<p>Therefore, our position is: in the negative aspect, we oppose the war preparations of all countries, we oppose wars waged for the benefit of a few bourgeoisies, and we oppose the cycle of violence begetting violence; in the positive aspect, we support everyone preparing for war, and we support the 1.25 billion oppressed people of the world uniting and preparing for war against the 250 million oppressors.</p>

<h3 id="e329">One Day Tian Yi Ping <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>This day was like any other peaceful day. There was no hurricane, no heavy rain. The working class had risen to work, and the bourgeois were searching for sweet dreams in their quilts. The sun poked its head from the east, shining into Mrs. Wang's bedroom. Her drowsy sleeping state was no longer visible on the bed, and Mr. Wang was already holding a newspaper and flipping through local news. Clearly, this day was different from peaceful days; at least something had happened at the Wang mansion to awaken this young couple from their sweet dreams.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were also chaotic sounds in the kitchen. Mrs. Wang was running up and down the stairs in her nightgown like a shuttle, she had to take care of everything when Mr. Wang got up, she had to order things in the kitchen. The entire Wang mansion was in a mess, only the two dark doors were tightly closed and did not move. After Mr. Wang finished reading the newspaper, he was urged diligently by Mrs. Wang, stretched out his arms, sat up, and a cigarette was sent to his lips. He took a puff of smoke and said like an ignorant child: "Is this little thing worth being so busy about?"</p>
<p>"It's your birthday, and you're lying in bed not getting up. Am I busy for the wrong reason?" Mrs. Wang's apple-like face, no matter how angry she was, burst out laughing after a while.</p>
<p>So we know that today is Mr. Wang's birthday.</p>
<p>In the hall hung a painting of a hundred longevity characters, a pair of golden characters written on red candles, inserted on the snow-white Three Principles flag, was so majestic, the steaming sacrificial offering attracted a little beggar who refused to leave outside the door.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's relatives, friends, Mrs. Wang's relatives, friends, one by one dressed very beautifully as if attending a fashion exhibition. Our Mrs. Wang was no longer dressed as when she was shuttling back and forth, but had changed into a newly tailored georgette cheongsam. Her face was of course always smiling, welcoming every guest, handing out cigarettes, taking out melon seeds, and entertaining many guests, so naturally and so elegantly. Praises and congratulations. We know that today is Mr. Wang's twenty-eighth birthday.</p>
<p>The lively situation in the Wang mansion today changed from a lunch for the couple to five tables of wine and dishes. Male and female servants carried dishes back and forth, the host diligently urged them to drink, and the guests naturally drank heartily.</p>
<p>Today afternoon, it was also unlike the usual when the couple rushed to the cinema, leaving the servants to doze off. Upstairs and downstairs, three tables of mahjong were being played with a bang, and many people surrounded them as spectators. Everyone playing mahjong cracked melon seeds, puffed on cigarettes, and chatted with the people behind them, talking about how they had won a lot of money by calling a three-fan hand the day before, or how a big hand had been played wrong and was called by the opponent, but they were always paying attention to every card played. White board pong, fourteen, twenty-eight, twenty-four, forty-eight. The people who called laughed, and the people who didn't call also laughed, and the onlookers were of course happy, because today is Mr. Wang's twenty-eighth big birthday.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, along with several friends who liked opium, huddled in the pavilion room, lying on the bed, sitting on the platform, burning black smoke, talking about the seventh and eighth ladies of Fuzhili and Yihongyuan. Whenever they talked about women, their eyebrows danced with joy. The laughter inside echoed the sound of cards outside. Today's special situation made the patrol officer in the lane also ask the amah who came back from fetching water in confusion: "What happy event is there at your master's house?"</p>
<p>"It's our young master's birthday." The amah replied with a smile, unlike the usual cursing "a thousand cuts".</p>
<p>Eating longevity noodles was another flurry of activity.</p>
<p>Dinner was especially a few hours later than usual, originally Mrs. Wang noticed that the wristwatch on her wrist was already ten o'clock and thought of starting dinner. The people playing mahjong, the onlookers, and the people in the pavilion room talking about women, time was not worth cherishing to them, let alone it being Mr. Wang's twenty-eighth small birthday.</p>
<p>Although the whole day had passed after the meal, it didn't hurt to borrow the time from tomorrow morning, and time didn't care about them anyway. This day was like any other peaceful day, there was no hurricane, no heavy rain, but the Wang mansion inside the two dark doors was experiencing an extraordinary day.</p>
<p>A young couple, after seeing off the guests, felt a slight weariness and went to bed when the sky was about to dawn.</p>
<p>The next day came as usual, the sun poked its head from the east and shone into Mrs. Wang's bedroom, here was quietly sleeping one person, everything was still like any other peaceful day.</p>
<h3 id="e330">(Disaster Relief Fundraising) Heart <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>The dusk after the autumn rain is a strangely interesting time: the playground is muddy and wet, and the leaves still drip with tiny drops of water; dense dark clouds and piled-up white mist are driven away by the newly blooming, delicate sunset, leaving them no place to stand. Low pressure turns into high pressure. People all feel relaxed, comfortable, and at ease. So, a few of us took chairs to the playground to enjoy this comforting time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a group of yellow-faced young men in short clothes ran in, holding pens and inkstones and something that looked like yellow paper bound into a booklet. The words "Disaster Relief Fundraising" were crookedly written on the thin surface. Speaking Shanghai dialect with a northern accent, they spoke vividly like the painted faces on the opera stage:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen: We are here today to solicit some disaster relief donations from your school. You gentlemen must know about the great flood in the Hankou area in the past, where the water rose to several feet, harming the people and their homes. Recently, the Yellow River has breached its banks, and the people there are certainly suffering from disasters again. They are all our compatriots, and everyone should help each other. So,</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>We have taken some free time to voluntarily come out to raise some donations to help them. We beg you gentlemen to give generously."</p>
<p>"Ah! You are enthusiastic philanthropists, coming to raise funds for the poor disaster victims, this is a most meritorious and reasonable thing, but we ourselves are also waiting for donations and relief from others!" We just perfunctorily brushed them off, with an attitude that was half-joking.</p>
<p>"Yes, gentlemen, since September 18th and January 28th, markets everywhere have declined, and the education sector has of course been similarly affected! We are well aware of this. However, we think of those who are suffering in the disaster now, living in a subhuman hell! We really can't bear to watch them suffer alive, and it is because of this sense of compassion that everyone should have, that we come here, not afraid of running around, to do this thing. Please gentlemen, don't just say polite words, we are all our own people, and it is right to help each other. We are always more fortunate than them, the water has not yet risen from under our feet: there is still food in our bellies, so we beg you gentlemen to give generously and donate as much as you wish, this is something that will accumulate infinite merit for you and your descendants!" The annoying fellows chattered on endlessly.</p>
<p>"In that case, I think it's better if we do this! We can't get much from the money of just a few of us, tomorrow I will solicit donations from our friends and the parents of the students of this school on your behalf, please leave an address, and I will write to you later to notify you to come and collect it!" Old Zhang cleverly seized their weakness.</p>
<p>Their faces changed, a forced bitter smile appeared on their faces, seemingly expressing that their trick could not succeed. "We poor people have no address," they muttered to themselves as they prepared to leave.</p>
<p>I listened quietly from the side, and finally, seeing their strange attitude, I felt a great deal of emotion! "The Yellow River breaching its banks" is an established fact, and "the disaster victims suffering a subhuman hellish life" is also just as much of an established fact like iron! Why did the Yellow River breach its banks? Should the disaster victims be given relief? Why are there actually people today who are using the guise of "disaster relief fundraising", with words sweeter than honey on their lips and the hearts of a bodhisattva, while in reality carrying out the deeds of wolves and dogs, collecting money under false pretenses? ... Whose responsibility is this? The Yellow River has breached its banks, and this society will also mature, with the same fate as the "Yellow River" drastically evolving! Who can still gloss over or deny this?</p>
<h3 id="e331">Autumn <a href="#e331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>The desolate autumn wind brings to the courtyard the sycamore trees with their fallen leaves, standing like bald men. The insects chirping in the fields add a touch of desolation.</p>
<p>On the radio, a shrill girl finished singing "Thank You, Drizzling Rain," and that familiar voice reported the news of the Chestnut King.</p>
<p>At the Rising Sun Building, where pedestrians throng, the giant chimney belches smoke. Two strong arms hold an iron shovel that could kill a person with one blow, slaughtering the gifts of autumn in the scorching black sand. Each bag contains twelve, the fragrant, sweet Liangxiang chestnuts. A crowd of people surrounds, chewing and savoring the shrill girl singing "Thank You, Drizzling Rain" that emanates from the radio.</p>
<p>Peeling chestnuts and walking along Nanjing Road, among the many "big sale" banners, you can once again feel that autumn has come. The Mooncake Fair, do you know? The Mid-Autumn Festival, when you raise your head to gaze at the bright moon and bow your head to think of your hometown, is just around the corner. At the Mooncake Fair, a model of Emperor Tang Minghuang touring the Moon Palace moves his hand inside the glass window illuminated by neon lights. There is no need for me to deliberately point out that, like at the chestnut stall, a crowd surrounds, I don't know if they are paying attention to the Emperor Tang Minghuang touring the Moon Palace toy, or salivating over that tower-like big mooncake?</p>
<p>Shanghai changes with the four seasons, but the people living in the Shanghai environment don't feel it! For example, with the Chestnut King and the Mooncake Fair, Shanghai people only know that these are two seasonal products of the present, they don't know that the desolate autumn and the heavily snowy winter are closely following behind.</p>
<p>Because if we turn a corner, it's the silk street that has a big sale all year round. The pitiful music of Autumn Fragrance is sent over day in and day out, a nonstop big sale... shameless advertising. This is also a seasonal product of the present, not for the sake of the children wearing new clothes; at this time, they dare to come up with this kind of plaything. Among the customers who crowd inside, there are many who have clothes they have never worn hidden at the bottom of their boxes.</p>
<p>Now I should talk about the women of autumn. The women of autumn are no different from the women of summer, thin clothes, bare legs, but they no longer have the courage to go to the swimming pool. Of course, women also know that it is cooler now than in the past, but for the future, they need to start training early to avoid digging a well when they are already thirsty and buying a plaster for a sore only when it hurts. Men are not so energetic, you see thick gray flannel suits already hanging on their bodies, like advertising mannequins in shop windows, and those artistic students with dirty feet have also moved their only evergreen serge suits onto their bodies, and if you compare them to your sweetheart hanging on your arm, you should really be ashamed!</p>
<p>"It's September 18th again!" someone said.</p>
<p>I heard a conversation about autumn next to the tram stop.</p>
<p>"What September 18th?" someone said.</p>
<p>"Today is September 18th!"</p>
<p>"Oh. I thought I bought 126918."</p>
<p>Why don't I ever run into 226622? Sometimes I think that too. The second issue is like the current toy, one yuan per strip, you have to give up smoking for a month to buy this strip. The amazing number of 50,000 yuan often wakes me up from my dreams; but so far I can't spare a yuan to touch my forehead |</p>
<p>However, I hope that this issue's special prize for that dear brother of my dreams is precisely 126918, a newly made camel hair robe, or waiting for him at his maternal uncle's house!</p>
<p>Drama</p>

<p>Act Three: A Eulogy to Peace</p>
<p>Voice: (Is madam inside?) Must I say it again? You've made such a mess of me.</p>
<p>Military Authority: It's all your fault; who told you to give me that kind of book to read?</p>
<p>Wife: (Laughing, coming from inside, leaning on her husband) That book is truly amusing. (Sits down) Ah, I'm so exhausted. I think we should go in and lie down for a while.</p>
<p>Military Authority: You go and sleep; I'll rest here for a moment... Why hasn't Secretary He returned yet?</p>
<p>Wife: Where did you send him?</p>
<p>Military Authority: I told him to go to Tian Yuping to inquire about his opinion on the government's telegram.</p>
<p>Wife: That Tian Yuping? The one who was sent last week to preside over political affairs?</p>
<p>Military Authority: That's right.</p>
<p>Wife: What? Didn't you say he was making things difficult for you everywhere? Why do you want to go to him to inquire about anything?</p>
<p>Military Authority: He's making things difficult for me? Humph! But this time, the credit for negotiating peace should be given to him anyway.</p>
<p>Wife: No matter what you do, I want to ask you: What do you plan to do? I've told you hundreds of times that, no matter what, I want you to send me back to Shanghai. Several planes came a few days ago and already frightened my mother. It has tired her old self so much she sent a telegram to ask. If the Japanese soldiers really disregard faith and start attacking Qiping without any reason, don't scare me to death.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Look! You're being childish again. Can't you rest assured? How could I bear to let you be frightened with me?</p>
<p>Wife: Then why aren't we leaving? Why do we have to live here in suspense?</p>
<p>Military Authority: Why do you have to live in suspense? Didn't I say you can rest assured?</p>
<p>Wife: Are you sure the peace talks will succeed?</p>
<p>Military Authority: Why wouldn't they succeed? As long as we are sincere on our side.</p>
<p>Wife: That's true, but if the conditions are bad, our money in the Bank of Taiwan will be in trouble.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Yes, for our own sake, we must cease hostilities.</p>
<p>Young Master: (Entering from the right side door, crying) Waaah... I'm going to tell Daddy... Waaah... (Goes upstairs)</p>
<p>Orderly: Good young master, good young master (Following behind him), please forgive me. Come on, shall I take you riding a horse?</p>
<p>Young Master: No, who wants to ride a horse? I'm going to tell.</p>
<p>Military Authority: (Hearing the crying) You bastard, who is bullying the child again? (Goes into the inner room immediately. Appears on the stairs shortly after.) What is it again? (Wife also follows behind)</p>
<p>Young Master: Daddy! This bastard cheated my money.</p>
<p>Military Authority: What?</p>
<p>Orderly: That's not true, sir.</p>
<p>Young Master: He wanted me to play poker with him.</p>
<p>Military Authority: (Raises his hand and slaps the orderly's cheek) Why did you teach him to gamble? You have some nerve!</p>
<p>Young Master: He took my money. I had four Aces, and he also had four Aces, but he insisted that the heart one was bigger. Daddy, I forgot what you taught me last time. You said, is the spade bigger or the heart bigger?</p>
<p>Military Authority: Are you a spade or a heart?</p>
<p>Young Master: I'm a spade.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Then of course the spade is bigger.</p>
<p>... Don't laugh. Remember in the future, the spade is bigger. (Orderly retreats) Don't cry. Let's play hide-and-seek. Auntie will play too. It will be so fun.</p>
<p>Young Master: Okay, I'll be it, you guys hide.</p>
<p>(The Military Authority covers his son's eyes, and crawls under the table himself. The auntie also hides. Afterward, the son comes to find them, and the Military Authority crawls back and forth on the ground. Before long, the Confidential Secretary pushes open the door on the right side and enters, laughing when he sees the scene. The Military Authority feels embarrassed and quickly stands up.)</p>
