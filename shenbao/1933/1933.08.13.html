<h3>平榆通車後之難題·都</h3>
<p>平榆通車問題。幾經迂廻頓挫之商洽。始决定於今日正式恢復。此在一般人之殷切期望中。自無不致其相當之慰惬而從事直接折衝之殷同劉石蓀輩。焦頭爛額。幸畢使命。亦寗能没其奔波之勸勞惟有一節。使吾人回呈杌揑懐無限之杞慮者。則以國家權益所在。要難視叛逆爲交涉之對象而先此數度談判。中曾否予僞方以挿足之機。會此後交涉之發生。復將作如何之應付。此固一大堪注意之問題也。</p>
<p>日人孵化下之傀儡組織。在國聯特别大會中。早經予以否認之處分。最近外部公布之國聯顧問委員會通告。對於否認［滿洲國］之辦。法頗能有明晰之規定。其於投罅抵隙。尤具防微杜漸之見。辦法第四項有云。［固不</p>

<p>關於恢復平榆交通一事。在大連會議中。即已决定辦法。徒以關内日軍。遲遲其撤。致巳成之議。復遭擱置。日前我方代表與日人在榆關會商時。方竟要求北寗路直逹瀋陽。而僞奉山路直逹北平。此突如其來之建議。謂出於日方渴望恢復全路之誠意乎。則日人固以破壤爲能事。寗顧商旅之利便。且北寗全路。阻斷巳久。何忽於咄嗟之問。冀其復常。謂出於日方堅持成見之傲岸政策乎。則塘沽恊定。本未列入範圍。自無成見可言其臨時造作狡　。誘我入殻。吾人稍一佇想。即不難窺其意響之所在矣。平政整會似亦見及於此。毅然予以拒絕。一時頗傅雙方態度堅决。事將陷於停頓。曾不二日。以殷同匆匆瀋行之結果。竟得有如斯迅捷之解决。此中變幻。殆難索解。據殷同對人談話。此次恢復通車。並未附有任何條件。惟就吾人默察所及。談商之地點爲關外參與之人物有闞鐸。而路權交還之形式。復爲出於僞方之直接讓與。我方之逐站接收。壇坫之地。讓受之際。其不能與僞方絕緣者。要爲吾人意計中事。至若通車榆關而後。彼間猶多僞機關之存在。我與處於密接錯綜之境。自將益感應付竭蹶之虞。當局亦曾先事一爲周愼之考慮。以獲得統籌之對策乎。</p>

<h3>中美聯航初步</h3>
<p>上海馬尼剌間明晨試航</p>
<p>中國航空公司、近爲溝通中美間敏捷交通起見、現正籌劃經斐律濱闢一中美航空綫、惟該綫因距離太長、非經過三四年後·不能實現、然該公司决以最勇敢奮毅之精神、籌備之、其初步計劃、即先由上海至馬尼剌間、闢一航空綫、并准於明晨出發試航、茲公誌於次、</p>
<h3>由美航綫計劃</h3>
<p>中國航空公司、現所擬進行之中美航綫、係由上海經香港至馬尼剌、然後再由馬尼剌渡太平洋、經檀香山、逹北美舊金山、惟該綫以美洲至斐律濱間、距離太長、途中雖有檀香山可以停留、然亦非有良好之飛機、及富有經騐之航空人才有可、故進行頗爲困難、據中國航空公司西董事畢克斯培氏表示、該綫之完成、尙須三四年、方可實現、</p>
<h3>先辦滬菲航綫</h3>
<p>該公司爲籌辦中美航空綫之聯航、决定先辦滬斐間之初步航綫、該綫之距離、據畢克斯培告新聲社記者、謂自上海至香港間之航綫、爲九百英里、香港至馬尼剌間爲七百五十英里、全綫共計一千六百五十英里、如以該公司所擬於明日試飛之寨柯斯機、負此線之航務、除中途停留不計外、須十六小時又卅分可逹、蓋該機每小時可飛行一百英里也、</p>
<h3>明日初次試航</h3>
<p>中國航空公司董事畢克斯培、本擬於昨晨率美機師搿羅樞·及恩麥·二人、乘水陸並用塞柯斯飛機出發試航、嗣因故改於明日（星期一）上午五時、自龍華飛機塲出發、仍偕以上兩美機師試航、并預定在福州略停留、俟加添汽油後、即直飛赴香港、准是日下午三時左右抵香港在香港擬逗留一日、再繼續赴斐、大約於十五日中午、可抵馬尼剌、聞明日出發時、并無郵局郵件、僅携帶私人委託數函云、</p>
<h3>新購飛機發軔</h3>
<p>明晨出發試航之塞柯斯號飛機、係該公司初於一月前購到之新機、有五百匹馬力之馬逹兩只、合共有千匹馬力之推動力、該機形式、與以前財政部長宋子文所損毁之飛機相同、該公司現已購得兩架、其一架即前次試飛滬粤綫者、速度每小時可航行一百英里云、</p>
<h3>外報紀載航程</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、中國航空公司之雙馬逹塞可斯式飛機探測香港馬尼剌間航空線、原定今晨（十三）在龍華飛機塲出發、嗣於昨夜决定展延至星期一（十</p>
<p>四）清晨五時啓程、至延期原因、詢諸太平洋美國航空公司副總董弼克斯柏、僅因明日適值香港星期日休息之期、故展緩至星期一離滬、此行將由格羅樞駕駛、弼克斯柏與另一飛行家侖米爾乘之同行、蓋照現擬計劃、上海至香港間利用中國航空公司之滬粤線、約九月間可望開辦、香港至馬尼剌間、由太平洋美國航空公司籌闢航線、馬尼拉至美國間、即由握有中國航空公司股票之聯美航空公司籌闢航線、大約在兩年内亦可實現、故此次探測航道、由弼克斯柏主持、預定自滬出發後、經福州·汕頭·廣州·而至香港、習日自香港出發、飛過東沙羣島、而至菲律濱之臘白拉度、添加燃料後、續往馬尼剌附近之喀伐德海軍飛行港、勾留數日、再自喀伐德飛回上海云、</p>
<h3>李景樅談開發西北航綫</h3>
<p>在政治上經濟上獲得不少成效</p>

<p>自裝屍之箱子綑屍之繩索等、由上九載回上海以後、日總領事署警務長花里等會同英租界捕房當局對於證物上加以研求、結果發覺指紋、依照此一線索、由花里·佐藤·愛甲·等三警官率幹警多人、四出活動偵察、經過一日兩夕之搜查、突然發見葡籍少年巴德力勒尼狄奥與此案有重大之嫌疑、查該葡人父爲葡萄牙人、母爲日本女子、而巴德尼勒奥乃混兒種、箱屍案之女子、即爲巴所殺害者、</p>
<h3>慘殺案發生原因</h3>
<p>葡人巴德力勒尼狄奥、年二十三歲、住在本埠崑山路義豐里Ｃ字一百七十四號屋内、共有弟兄四人、姊妹兩人、係操神女生涯者、巴德力勒尼狄奥品性亦不馴良、在本月三日、該葡人原住在嘉興路十五號屋内、與廣東女子陸姓者（即慘</p>
<p>殺之女屍）同居一室、兩人之愛情、非常熱烈、時常至舞塲跳舞、及北園中游覽、三日夜中、在嘉興路十五號樓上、兩人發生口角、而至大爭吵、其時適有捕房警官經過、乃入内詢問、而該葡人即將室内電燈全熄、並稱本人爲朝鮮籍、表示不受警官干涉、而警官祇得退出、慘案即在此時發生、</p>
<h3>殺女後搬屋避匿</h3>
<p>葡人巴德力勒尼狄奥ＰａｔｒｉｃＲｅｄｅｄｉａｏ與廣東女子陸某、先則吵嘴、繼乃動武、當時由葡人將廣東女子痛擊、似用拳猛毆、致傷及胸部、打倒以後、巴德力勒尼狄奥復用繩將該女子勒斃、乃至慘案釀成以後、該葡人巴德之兄亦在塲、即主張購用一箱、而以女尸舁入設法運至外埠、巴德聽乃兄之主意、購得黑箱一隻、即將死者尸體綑後裝入箱内、此事神鬼不覺、僅有在場之兩兇手知之耳、至四日、僱用人力車一輛將此尸箱裝到匯山碼頭、運赴日本神戶、而巴德力勒尼狄奥於運出女尸之後、便從嘉興路逃出、至崑山路義豐里乃父處居住、以避風聲、</p>
<h3>女子曾充救護員</h3>
<p>被殺之女子陸某、聞爲廣東女子中學畢業、區浦芳爲廣州財政廳長時、陸姓女子曾入財廳辦事、故文學頗佳、惟品性輕佻、故未久即辭職來滬、一二八戰事之役、該女子曾加入廟行一戰後之救護傷兵及難民工作、戰後陸女乃邂逅葡籍少年、由友而至戀愛、遂實行同居、陸女之貎、甚爲美麗、近來因跳舞之故、在外又有男友往回、而葡籍少年乃頓興醋念、初以口角、女不服乃釀成因嫉妒而致慘殺、當非始料所及也、</p>
<h3>日警捕逮眞兇手</h3>
<p>此次之慘案、起意於巴德力勒尼狄奥、而殺斃後之運箱赴日、兇手之兄名左爾Ｊａｌ則恊同助理、日警長花里佐藤愛甲等偵查明白後、遂報告日領、向工部局巡捕房磋商逮捕兇手、一面則要求葡領事簽製逮捕狀、並商兇手捕獲後之引渡至日領署詢問、因此種種手續、費時較多、故花里警長恐犯人或聞風逃遁、遂於昨晨密派大隊探捕至崑山路義豐里將Ｃ字一七四號房屋包圍、俟逮捕狀簽發到後、便即實行逮捕提案訊辦、此離奇古怪之箱尸案、至今乃得水落石出也、查兇手巴德力勒尼狄奥、其父名勒尼狄奥、與日本女子中村所生、在一月以前、借嘉興路十五號房屋、其兄左爾、今年二十六歲、其行爲本一不良少年、此次運尸等計劃、悉出其所主張、如何結果、容再續探、</p>

<h3>到此一游</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>因爲身份資格的關係，我雖渴幕着廬山牯嶺，但終於違反了心願，而來到西湖。</p>
<p>西湖的水，仍是這麽緑澄澄的。峯曫　合，仍是這麽怪挻秀的。中國，眞不愧是一片錦　江山。我們急應［及時］飽賞一一番，方不負此湖山勝地！</p>
<p>我剛到西湖，就整整跑了一天，重訪湖山諸勝。　影湖光，今不異昔。足跡所經，［到此一游］的墨蹟，雅俗共賞的題詞，都仍舊觀。宅們非特能使白壁變黑，並給韜光增添許多［斑竹，］大有豹死留皮，人死留名之意。</p>
<p>我們姑不談這些墨蹟能否爲湖山生色。僅就我個人觀感而言，總覺得有些剌目。這或許因爲我太是缺乏［詩人氣味］的緣故。</p>
<p>我獨坐在北高峯上，反復思索何以［騒人墨客］必得题民句［到此一游］的用意。但搜不出一個正當解答來。直至繭天翻開西游記，看到孫悟空在如來佛掌上翻觔斗一段文字，我才恍然大悟。這段原文是··</p>
<p>······那大聖收了如意棒，抖擻精神，將身一縱，拈在佛祖手心裏，却道聲［我去也，］你看他一路雲光，無形影去了，······大聖行時，忽見五根肉紅柱子。撑着一股青氣，他道，［此間乃盡頭路了·····］又思量道，［且住，等我留下些記號，方好與如來說話，］拔下一根毫毛，變作一管濃墨雙毫筆，在那中間柱子上寫一行大字云··［齊天大聖到此一游］，····却在第一根柱子下，撒了一泃尿，······</p>
<p>喲，我們知道猢猻是人類的祖始。現在人類雖說進化，但少數人猶木盡木盡脫［本色］。不過孫悟空的玩法，確實與衆不同；宅於［到此一游］之外，還得撒上泡尿。現代［詩人］就祇能題句，而不會撒尿。不，這似乎不是會撒不會撒的問題。試想，他們腹中有的是［詩］，到處揮灑，當然不覺費力。可是，假使每到一處，要他們撒上泡尿，這就無異一種刑罰。曹予建七步可以賦得成詩，但决没有人敢担保他七步可以撒得出尿。由此可知撒尿之難，其寳難於賦詩。因爲，尿雖人人會撒，却不準定隨時可撒。而詩，不管他是屁詩，　詩，隨時隨地都可揮灑出來。（如果因爲做不出詩而［急］出尿來，當然與［撒］不同，不能算是詩人，祇能作爲例外，）所以我認爲現代［詩人］僅題句而不撒尿，乃是他們的尿是否［供］［求］相抵的問題。如果說［詩人］只有［到此一游］這一手，而不會撒尿，那就未免小視［詩人］了。</p>
<p>地·悄悄地，送通一陣醉人的　　，輕　的姑娘們的笑聲！</p>
<p>小的河，小的橋，人工的像山，兩邊滿裁着松，柏的行人道。孩子們拍着手，在大人脚　　攢過去，每一張椅子，坐滿了迎候更夜晚風的夥伴；男的夥伴瞅着女的夥伴，輕凉的風，在每一個夥伴心口兒上，是那麽甜甜地，凉凉地！</p>
<p>閲報處，顧碰着頭，黑的，大的，小的字，在黄的燈光底下跳；娱樂處，胡琴絲弦的振震，窗口，擁着那麽一大堆人；祭孔彝器陳列處，門，深深地緊　着作着懐古的夢；民衆敎育館，黑　　地躱在角上，　着夜晚恐怖的幻景；賣冰賣汽水的明耀的燈光，倒映着簧的，白的橘子汁，汽水的瓶，白的檯毯，細的乳黄的臘管，少爺和小姐，低着頭在喝着那香冽清凉的飲料。</p>
<h3>虹口的浴池素描</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>在這炎日當頭的夏天，誰也會不約而同地到清凉的虹口浴池去。</p>
<p>在這裏有世界各國的男女？有日本的，有西洋的，有美國的······總之，這裏是世界曲綫美和健康美的展覽會！</p>
<p>木凳上坐着穿時裝的摩登女子，注視伊愛人的游泳的姿勢。</p>
<p>白俄女子凸出伊們特有的胸部，發出尖銳的歡呼聲，搶着浮在水上的皮球。</p>
<p>孩子們追跑着，一個不留心，撲通的滑入池中，四周發出一陣狂笑！</p>
<p>一對西洋男女，睡在草地的一角，男的摸着女的大腿，女不嬉笑着！</p>
<p>日本的男女活潑潑地游泳着，十足地表現島國人民的絕技！</p>
<p>幾個女的，披着毛巾，羞答答地站在池旁，從未見伊們下過水，或者伊們别有作用！</p>
<p>籬外立着幾個從江灣出來的鄉下老，嘆息着</p>
<h3>新陸夏夜</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>搭慶寗市夜行火車，經過了一個小站再東行，不要二十分鐘，便到了新陸車站，那是因爲有一座新陸師範在着的緣故。這晚，我們就宿在校舍裏。</p>
<p>走下火車，逆回來百幾步，向左轉，便是一條已被月先蘢照了的挻長寬闊的石子路，這路直通校舍；兩邊的樹影，望過去赿遠越密，也赿見矮，而且相對地銜接起來。風輕輕地吹，樹影也瑟瑟地抖動，蟬聲在一致地歌，雜着各種夏蟲的鳴啾，便組織成幽靜的情調。同時一種類乎雨後的草香，那樣凉爽地撲着鼻子，使人感到說不出的快愉。這裏就没有夏的威嚇，而有着夏的美麗！</p>
<p>大家不作聲，看前面的人影飄忽地移動，月光中飛着白綢衫子，那虎鞋踏着淺莎，幽幽地發出低唱；我便脫下白氈帽，掛在松枝上，出神地體會這一刹那的鍾感，然而没有詩。</p>
<p>經過棕櫚林，挺硬的葉，拍拍地交響，這時緑的色彩，充滿了動的活力，像在南菲洲的菓子園裏搩視松鼠的情景。突然前面發出一聲呌，嚇我一跳，後來知道唐小姐因爲貪看夜景，昻頭向天，誤踏了路中的一個　窟才驚呌的。　　晚飯後，全淴過浴，便一律赤了脚，拖着草鞋，去大園林的濃樹下找尋長椅子。一共七個人，各去尋自已的安宿，各向不可知的地方散開了。園裏又没有另外人，只有沉靜，幽悄，恬逸，懶散。佔據全園的幾乎不復是我們，而是風樹與夏蟲。</p>
<p>想來每個人正像我一樣横躺在椅上，抬着雙眼，看樹葉隙上的天，天上的月和雲，雲裏的紋彩；否則，爲什麽一點聲音都没有呢！正確的，在我只覺得欣快，但我不想知道這就是欣快，而且我絕不知道我是欣快着，在我再能說什麽呢！</p>
<p>假如世界上眞有靜止的時候，我的經騐中，這一忽兒要算最眞實的了。自然樹上有着蟬鳴，草間有着蟲鳴，一切的花葉有着風鳴；但我没有聽到，没有想到。</p>
<p>打破這［無我］的夢，是從遠遠襲飛來的催眠曲的聲音，是鄒小姐唱的聲音；繼着南面也尖聲地和着合唱。不曉得是誰，繼着北面也起了同樣的歌聲，再繼着各方面都一致跟着唱了起來，混合了西洋歌劇的調和的高中次音，但是輕輕的，紆徐的，曼妙的，還是覺得靜，而且使我引起了童心的回憶，我不是在新陸的花園裏，而是在母親的温暖的懐中呀！</p>
<p>不久這歌聲由選緩低落下去，漸漸聽不見，</p>
<h3>夏緑池賞荷</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>消暑的所在，最好當然是青山深處，古木參天；或是十畝菌舊，開遍水面。上海有這種好所在嗎？人人敢肯定的說；没有！没有！不要說青青的山，便連一個高高的土邱都没有。馬路上祗有十幾層的巨厦，像長人般轟立着。晚上放射出千道的年紅燈光；包含着百般的繁華熱閙，祇會使人目眩神迷，那裏談得上消署暑二字。講到水呢，雖有黄浦江和蘇州河，像巨蛇般挺臥着。那黄濁的水色；腥惡的氣味；上邊臥着幾隻殺人的鐵艦；駛着裝載人貨的商輪和木船。甚麽斜陽垂釣；甚麽野渡舟横；甚麽漁舟唱；這種十八世紀式的詩意盡境，早不配安放在前進和摩登的上海都市裏。</p>
<p>［望梅可以止渴，慰情聊勝於無。］上海畢竟還有幾個人工做的　型山水。半淞園和梵王渡花園，早已人盡皆知。便是城隍廟裏後園的假山；湖心亭前邊像陰溝般的臭水，誰敢否認他不是山水咧？除了上述幾處地方，新近我又發現了一個私人的花園。幾畝菡舊，清香四溢，眞是絕妙的消暑去處。</p>
<p>這園在閘北八字橋北端，爲粤人陳君所有。占地數十畝，除了應有的點缀外，荷池倒占了三分之一的面積。今年園主人發了遊園券，請人去賞荷，在下也僥倖地得了一張，約了幾個朋友，走到那個所在。矮矮的圍墙，嵌着兩劇鐵門，題着［陳氏耕讀園］五個字。撳了門鈴，那園丁問了一回；從門縫襄張看了一回。見是遊客，没精打彩地開了園門，讓你進去。一副壓晝愛靜的樣子，眞呌人進退全非。［十扣柴扉九不開。］可謂這園丁吟咏，不過你未免辜負你的主人的美意了！</p>
<p>進門有一塊廣大的草坪，園着大樹，裁着些花，傍晚時坐坐，倒也很好。草地的北端，有一座三開的平房，門前蹲着二隻石獅，氣象很雄壯。再進去漸入佳境，一隻六角式的竹亭，滿繞了紫藤，中間放着石桌石凳，倒也古香古色。再過去便是荷池了，有湖心亭，有九曲橋，旁邊還有假山。我們揀了一隻水亭坐下，那亭三面臨水，靠陸方面，裁着不少緑竹，着實軒敝風凉。望那池裏，荷葉像千萬把的緑綢傘張着；白色的蓮華，眞像一個仙女在波上靜立；清雅的香氣，沁人心脾，隨着風一陣陣吹來，眞呌人三萬六千個毛孔，無一孔不爽快。池裏頭還有不少小魚，在運葉底下遊戲，唼喋有聲。在這種境界裏，呌人想起我佛清靜，亦愛蓮華，極樂國裏，七寳池中，當然遍佈了蓮花蓮葉。今天我們坐在這裏，豈不也是極樂世界嗎？這時外邊又來了二位西裝青年，他們向荷池望了一回，一個說道··偌大荷池柯惜没有一個採蓮佳人，要是甜姐見黎莉莉赤足露腿在這裏採蓮，豈不有趣！一個接着說道··蓮華有甚麽好看，把宅剗除了，改作游泳池，倒比虹口的闊大咧！我聽了他們的話，不禁替蓮花呌屈。摩登的時代，祇有豐肥的肉腿，繼招人愛玩，清靜的緑荷，有誰來愛你呢！</p>
<p>這渡到［靜之岸］的中間，是非常地自然，非常地朧朦。世界再恢復到［無我］的夢中，月光抱住了我的軀體，我是睡在大自然的摇籃裏。就這樣，夏夜吹着漫天的春風。</p>
<h3>夜凉中的文廟</h3>
<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>是南市夜游的聖地，是枯寂生活中消裏的游園。</p>
<p>東方的，古典的，石的圓柱，聳立在門前的［牌樓，］風，由男子們的羅紡的袖口上，吹到女人口邊的小渦渦。</p>
<p>燈光由乳白色的圓球，散射在這夏晚夜凉的宫殿，古典式的亭角鵝黄的高墙，紅的柱脚，紅的簽子，隠隠地映射着天花板上，銀色藍花的圖案。</p>
<p>夏夜的風，由每一個男人的鼻尖，胸口，吹上每一個姑娘擺動地的腰肢，由人工小河的每一枝樹杈上，吹上那一片小小的草地；風，輕快夜凉的風，由那薔薇和葡萄棚的底下，風，脂粉流香的風；由那燈柱冬青樹的身畔，幽幽男女共浴，世風日下的社會！</p>
<p>没有錢買票的幾個年青的漢子，從小窟窿中像要把頭攢進去地看，批評着女人們的胸部！</p>
<h3>太湖半日游</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>終日迷漫在煤氛中的無鍚人，今年眞是不幸，自從入夏以來，氛温總在九十度以上，火傘高張，熱𦦨疆人，别說勞苦在機器馬逹邊頭的工人要呌苦連天，就是我們坐在寫字間電風扇下的所謂先生們，也仍然汗流浃背，好像悶在熱蒸蘢轟。</p>
<p>一天下午，寒暑表已升到九十九度半，草木一齊萎疲在烈日淫威之下，野狗都伸長了呑頭，不住的喘息着；我正在坐也不是立也不是熱得走頭無路的當見，忽聽得門口河邊上［叭！</p>
<p>叭！］呌了兩聲，我急忙迎出門去一看，原來是幾位朋友雇了汽油艇來邀我去太湖游泳，我頓時興高彩烈回進臥室換上洲泳衣，好像忘了剛才有悶熱，帶了汽水，浴巾等等應用的東西，和朋友們一齊上艇，大約是下午二時左右，這汽艇在烈日下［叭叭］地吼了兩聲，就勇敢地向太湖進發。</p>
<p>［我們就這裏下去玩一下！］一位善於游泳的童舒培君這樣當衆提議，我首先附議，接着，張君陳君和一位李小姐都贊成了，於是大家脫去外衣，祇剩着一件衣褲連在一起的游泳衣，一起勇敢地向水裏前進。</p>
<p>李小姐初學游泳，抱着一塊木板，在淺水處練習，由童君在旁敎授，我和張陳二君都各自暫充魚蝦，在較深的湖面浮游着，除了半個腦殻以外，全身都淺沉在凉幽幽綠蔭蔭的湖水裏，各人的意識，都忘記了夏季的炎熱。</p>
<p>李小姐看我們游得眼熱，也到了較深的地方嘗試，抛了木板，四肢劇烈划動，誰知手法未熟，湖水立刻將伊沉没了，童君見勢不佳，劇呌了一聲大家來！］立卽灒入水底，幸喜我們還没有游到以前，勇敢的童君，已將李小姐自水底救出水面，不曾加入游泳在岸上旁觀的同伴們，都不約而同地喊了一聲好險啊！］</p>
<p>大家都回到岸上，但李小姐一絲没有受傷，僅僅被無情的水，壓迫伊吃了兩口，伊雖然說··［水的力量眞大，可以使人失掉自主力，］但伊仍不表示畏縮，精神也依然很好，並且還預備到黿渚練習呢，可見李小姐是很有些勇敢堅强的毅力，大家都很佩服伊。</p>
<p>這時才四時十分，大家整隊歸艇，再向黿頭渚進發。</p>
<p>到了黿頭渚，我們就在［横雲］下面游泳，湖水是蠡園淺了，不過水不甚清，而且湖底都是崎嶇山石，不善游泳的很昜碰痛手或脚，李小姐恐怕碰傷了伊的冰肌玉膚，緊緊地抱着那塊木板不肯放手。一位俏皮的張君。在相距一丈多水面看見了［啊！木板！木板！；你眞好福氣！］張君狂笑着在水裏這樣喊，［是的，在這裏，木板是我唯一的愛人，］李小姐很天眞地這樣說着，把木板更緊緊地樓着，張君忽然又狂喊了··［我願意做這塊木板！］大家都笑了，李小姐這才略略含羞地駡了一聲［啐壞蛋］　　我們和童君重入水裏，打算痛快地游一會再回去，四個人議决到水裏戰爭一番，童君游泳術最精，他一個人一方，我和張陳二君三人聯合向他進攻，勝負以吃水先後爲標準，誰先被撳入水中吃水一口，誰就算輸了。</p>
<p>五時半了，大家一齊整理回艇，烈日的光熱，漸漸衰老，湖的上晚風，不住地吹進艙來，各人都覺得非常凉爽，汽艇軋軋地向歸途猛進，大家在這豪闊的太湖，飽嘗了半日大自然的賜予，都有些倦意，各自在艙裏睡的睡坐的坐十分愉快，六時三刻回到家裏，這半天的炎夏，總算偷偷地逃避過了。</p>

<h3>董康等對籌印四庫全書意見</h3>
<p>▲有他本可以替代者應採用他本</p>
<p>▲未刋本名稱範圍内容應加考量</p>
<p>中央圖書館籌印四庫全書未刋本一節、北平圖書館蔡元培·袁同禮兩氏、曾有書面致敎育部有所陳述已誌前報、茲悉此事已引起南北學者嚴重注意、前日曾由董康傅增湘葉恭綽諸氏聯名致書敎育部當局、作進一步之建議、茲將建議書探錄如左、</p>
<p>雪艇先生部長大鑒、近報紙紛傅大部有籌印四庫全書未刋本之議、且將開始工作矣、宣揚文化、提携學術、無任欽佩、惟茲事體大、非徇一二人之意所能立致、茲有二事、未敢默爾、謹爲先生陳之管蠡之見、或有補於萬一、幸垂察焉、</p>
<h3>採用他本</h3>
<p>㈠四庫書有他本可用以替代者、應採用他本也、考四庫成書時、館臣任意圖改、有惡其内容不雅馴者、如周南山房集之删疎文、周孚蠡齋鉛刀篇之删鑄兩文是也、有惡其行文多忌諱者、如黄宗義明文海、凡明人制夷禦侮之作、多加删落、以稿本明文案比勘、便可了然其著例也、此外宋元人文集奏議中精粹語、爲庫本失書者、又何止千數、而卷數之增出倒置序目之刋落改削、更無論矣、有據殘本入錄而原書尙存天壤間者、有據輯本入錄而所輯實未完善者、凡此種種目錄、學家類能言之、今茲選印、似應先向海内外公私藏家及專門名家廣徴意見、嚴定去取、所有各書無他本可代者、則彚爲甲編、以示别於他書、至其他各書雖近世無覆刻本、然宋元明舊刻或舊抄具在、較庫本高出百倍或卽庫本所自出者、則彚爲乙編與甲編之書、互爲表裏、相輔而行、甲乙兩編、擬定名日四庫羣珍、（或以他名代之亦可）而詳著編輯改革之旨、於凡例中、以明示世人、如此則二難并矣、如讀乙編之書、旣非庫本、似不必與甲編合印、以昭劃一、實則甲編之書、悉用庫本、本巳無甚價蠡可言、今有乙編輔行、使甲集之書爲之增色、　内外學人必奔走相賀、使天下後世知大部籌印此書之經過、非草率將事者可比、豈不善哉、如謂乙編之書徴集非昜、善本盤窮、烏能立致、此亦過慮、且中國版本目錄之學至今日而極盛、國内固不乏精通斯學之士、國外亦有聞風繼起者、屬於調查編製諸項、儘可延聘專門名家、或委諸以藏舊刻善本書著稱之公私圖書館與中央圖書館共同負責辦理、限以時日、事必能成是非得失、在此一舉、此願爲先生告者一也、</p>
<h3>重加考量</h3>
<p>㈠四庫全書未刋本名稱及範圍内容應重加考量也、查四庫各書、據稿本入錄者、爲數繁多、卽輯自永樂大典或錄自抄本者、當時亦大抵有刋本或事刻本、　　世久違　　湮没不傅耳、茲所選印如統以未刋爲名、似欠斟酌、不如以北平館近編之罕傅本目、以罕傅爲名、較合於邏輯也、如謂未刋云者、乃狭義的而非廣義的則狭義的未刋究至何代截止、謂截止於明以前耶、則何解於近出之中央圖書館所輯擬目中、亦有明人著述在内、謂截止於明清以前耶、則書雖刋於明代、而傅世之希罕、不亞於宋元舊刻、如北河犯滇略等書、何以悉入探入、且中央館擬目中所收宋元人著述、如經部之石鼓論語問答、四書管窺史部之太平治跡統類、大金德運圖說、熬波圖予部中之資政要覽、集部之苕谿集山房集本堂集等、皆有同元後單刋本或叢書本、何以又悉未列入、似此矛盾支離、殊難索解、似應卽日、延聘通儒、從長考量、否則徒令外人齒冷、此願爲先生告者二也、此上所舉、均係當務之急務、希先生等本學術公器之至意、採愚者一得之請獻、弟等不敏、於薄錄之學粗涉藩籬、自當勉盡棉力、共襄大舉、以底於成、文化前途、實利賴之敬布區區、諸希鑒諒、專此順頌道祺、董康·傅增湘·葉恭綽·朱啓鈐·江瀚·沈士遠·朱希袓·李盛鐸·沈兼士·陳垣·張允亮·徐鴻寳·馬廉·冒廣生·馬衡·徐乃昌·張之銘·顧燮光·顧頡剛·劉復·湯中·陳寅恪·陶湘·趙尊嶽·劉承幹同啓、</p>

<h3>天津一敗塗地上海奪得泰格德杯</h3>
<p>｜昨日第二日上海連勝三組｜</p>
<p>▲老邱小鄭雙勝兩史雙打亦凱旋</p>
<p>▲今日最後兩塲已無關錦標得失</p>
<p>上海天津埠際網球賽第二日之結果、已將錦標解决、上海連勝三組、奪得泰格德銀杯、鄭兆佳三比一勝大倫强、邱飛海以三比○勝傑漢生、雙打史篤克史規亞勝弗勃惠氏、三比一、天津一敗塗地、甚堪惋惜、其球藝平平、殊非上海敵手、今日下午三時起、尙有最後二塲、但已不關錦標勝負矣、</p>
<p>▲鄭兆佳先克大倫强</p>
<p>鄭兆佳對大倫强之單打、昨日先行續賽、鄭兆佳又得第四盤、鄭以三比一得勝、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳（滬）二比六　六比三　六比一　六比四　大倫强（津）</p>
<p>鄭兆佳對倫强之單打、日昨鄭以二比一佔先、因天晚停止、昨日下午二時起、二人繼續補賽、開始後、鄭頗不利、球多自殺、以一比三局、屈居下風、爭得第五局後、又失第六局、成二比四、從此鄭謹愼作戰、專用左右對角游擊、力避自殺、球勢乃大爲轉變、倫强奔走不遑、一籌莫展、以下鄭連得四局、而以六比四勝、總結果爲三比一、鄭勝、比數爲二比六、六比三、六比一、六比四、津滬埠際網球賽（單打）右戰勝倫强之鄭兆佳、中傑漢生（津）左邱飛海（滬）、</p>
<p>（李鄭庸攝）</p>
<p>▲邱飛海横掃傑漢生</p>
<p>邱飛海與天津第一單打傑漢生之戰、繼之而起傑漢生雖爲津沽好手、以與老邱對敵、尙非敵手、在老邱左右揮拍之下、竟以三個六比○大敗、片甲不留、可謂慘矣、至此上海已奪二組、尙須一組、卽得錦標矣、</p>
<p>邱飛海（滬）　六比○　六比○　六比○　傑漢生（津）</p>
<p>▲邱飛海三個六零邱先開球、傑漢生應手回答、隨之卽趕上網前、攔起一殺、被其先得一分、以此聲勢、初不料其後之一敗塗地、不堪收拾、邱不慌不忙、開始其左右角球抽、連勝四記、先得一局、傑開球、仍欲上網、邱之底線深抽、傑毫無辦法、又歸邱得、一局又一局、老邱愈戰愈勇、至五比零時、其抽球之凶硬、有千鈞之勢、第一盤六比零、第二盤開始、傑力與抗禦、在平等後邱佔先一記時、傑壓殺一邱之高球、危局似可挽救、但第二盤又成六比零、第三盤邱之發球、深入角底、先得一局、第四局時、傑在網前、老邱表演一邊線球、全塲鼓掌、結果竟不予傑漢生一局、一口氣、連勝十八局、可謂豪矣、</p>
<p>▲傑漢生毫無生路</p>
<p>傑漢生爲鼎鼎大名之足球名將、有李惠堂之威風、故善於奔走、其尙能與老邱應付往來者、其脚步之快、救球多次、球尙有力、但抽擊毫無把握、失分之中、敗於出界者不可記、觸網亦累累、惟攔網尙佳、在邱之猛抽之下、生　毫無、徒見計窮力竭、忙於應付矣、其球藝三等而巳、</p>
<p>▲上海雙打兩史亦勝</p>
<p>一組、上海史篇克史規亞雙打之勝惠氏及角勃、遂便上海隊奪得錦標、全勝三組、今日之戰、已無關得失矣、</p>
<p>史篤克　史規亞　（滬）　六比三　七比九　七比五　七比五　惠氏　弗勃（津）</p>
<p>▲悶沉局面　此最後之雙打一場最感悶沉乏味、因雙方自殺送去之得分不少不少、遂使已勝之局、復歸失敗、尤以上海爲甚、常有四十｜零之局、結果失敗者、第二盤上海已以五比四佔先、第十局爲四十｜零、但結果竟失敗而成五比五、天津得六比五後、上海連得二局、再以七比六超出、但四十｜零可勝之局、又歸天津、七比九失敗、不亦怪哉、第一盤天津得三比二、上海連勝四局、以六比三得勝、第三第四兩盤、如出一轍、第三盤中天津得四比二之先、上海奪得三局、以五比四超、但發球局失敗、成五比五、次局擊破惠氏之發球再得其下之發球而以七比五得勝、第四盤依樣葫蘆、毫無二樣、不亦奇哉、</p>
<p>▲球藝平平　雙方球藝、可稱伯仲、上海稍佔優勢、如果稍有把握、則當大勝、技在余田光輩下、兩史之中、互有功罪、以史篤克較穏、其壓殺甚得力、史規亞以發球年分者有之、重錯失、分者亦有之、在底線前壓球、送入網内者無數、天津之惠氏矣、擱網尚佳、開球無力、其開球局送去幾十居七八、弗勃較佳、尙可入目也、　　▲今日最後二塲比賽</p>

<h3>踼</h3>
<p>— 豐之諭</p>
<p>兩月以前，曾經說過［推］，這回却又來了［踼］。本月九日［申報］載六日晚間，有漆匠劉明山，楊阿坤，顧洪生三人在法租界黄浦灘太古碼頭納凉，適另有數人在左近聚賭，由巡警察上前驅逐，而劉顧兩人，竟被俄捕弄到水裏去，劉明山竟淹死了。由俄捕說來，自然是［自行失足落水］的。但據顧洪生供，却道··［我與劉，楊三人，同至太古碼頭乘凉，劉坐鐵凳下地板上，······我立在旁邊，······俄捕來先踼劉一脚，劉巳立起要避開，又被踼一脚，以致跌入浦中，我要拉救，已經不及，乃轉身拉住俄捕，亦被用手一推，我亦跌下浦中，經人救起的。推事問··［爲什麽要踼他？］答··［</p>
<p>不知。］</p>
<p>［推］還要抬一抬手，對付下等人是犯不着如此費事的，於是乎有［踼］。而上海也眞有［踼］的專家，有印度巡捕，有安南巡捕，現在還添了白俄巡捕，他們將沙皇時代對猶太人的手段，到我們這里來施展了。我們也眞是善於［忍辱負重］的人民，只要不［落浦］，就大抵用一句滑稽化的話道··［吃了一隻外國火腿］，一笑了之。</p>
<p>苗民大敗之後，都往山裏跑，這是我們的先帝軒轅氏趕他的。南宋敗殘之餘，就往海邊跑，這是據說也是我們的先帝成吉思汗趕他的，趕到臨了，就是陸秀夫背着小皇帝，跳進海裏去。我們中國人，原是古來就要［自行失足落水的］。　　有些慷慨家說，世界上只有水和空氣給與窮人。此說其實是不確的，窮人在實際上，那是能夠得到和大家一樣的水和空氣。即使在碼頭上乘乘凉，也會無端被［踼］，送掉性命的··落浦。要救朋友，或拉住凶手罷，［也被用手一推］··也落浦。</p>
<p>時代在進步，輪船飛機，隨處皆是，假使南宋末代皇帝而生在今日，是决不至於落海的了，他可以跑到外國去，而小百姓以［落浦］代之。　　這理由雖簡單，却是　雜，故漆匠顧洪生日··［不知。］</p>
<h3>［汪逹爾人］辦</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>亨利·喬治（ＨｅｎｒｙＧｅｏｒｇｅ）說··［不是在沙漠成森林中，是在都會的貧民窟裏面和大路上，起來一羣野蠻的人，他們將要在現代文明中做出匈奴人和汪逹爾人在古代所做的事來。］</p>
<p>［匈奴人］是我們所熟知的，至於［汪逹爾人］，則見諸西洋歷史上，是古日耳曼部落之一，五世紀時，在非洲建過王國。據說紀元後四百五十五年那年，他們曾攻陷羅馬，在兩個禮拜的佔領中，破壞得很兇，連文學科學等建築物也不留。他們就因此得名。至今西洋人的字典上，留着他們的大名Ｖａｎｄａｌｅ，然而解作［文學科學等建築物之破壞者］，還在他們的大名下加上ｉｓｍ，成爲破壞藝術的行爲的專稱。實際上，汪逹爾人乃是舊物的澈底破壞者。</p>
<p>接着亨利·喬治的話，託爾斯泰說··［汪逹爾人已經在俄國準備好了。而且在深刻地宗敎化的我們的人民之間，他們將特别可怕，因爲我們不懂得這些控馭法··即在歐洲人民間極其發逹的禮儀和公論。］</p>
<p>託爾斯泰所說的汪逹爾人，果然長久地佔領了俄國，在起初，確實也破壞得兇，對於所謂［現代文明］。然而，在澈底的破壞之後，他們倒在新的基礎上，建設起現代文明以上的文明來了。</p>
<p>中國的汪逹爾人，自然也在準備着的。然而因爲中國是周公孔子的中國，故禮儀和公論的發逹的程度，非但使我國人望塵莫及，即託爾斯泰所稱的歐洲人，也差得遠。因此，中國人的控馭術，特别高明，觀乎歷代的同化外族，歷次的消弭反動，就可知道這些控馭術的效果。</p>
<p>伹汪逹爾人其實是含寃的。因爲文學科學乃至藝術的破壞，初非他們的專門。去年商務印書館的炸燬，今年性科學書館的焚燒，其實倒是東西洋現代文明人之所爲。</p>
<h3>關於翻譯的話</h3>
<p>— 大聖</p>
<p>日前某君談［翻譯］與［編述］，曾說··［聽說現在有許多翻譯家，連把原作從頭到尾瞧一遍的功夫也没有，翻開第一行就譯，對於原作的理解，更無從談起。］又說··［顯然的，對於一種學理作精深刻苦的研究，能指揮如意地應用的學者，我們還非常缺乏。］對於這話，我是絕對的同意，實在，目前我們的出版界的大部分的譯品太糟得令人不敢領敎了，無論是那一類譯品，往往看了三四頁，還是［不知所云，］從書本上跳進眼裏的只是一個一個的字，如果把它覇蠻連成句，則旣不是中國話，也不像外國話，越看越不懂，赿看越不通。當然，讀者在讀不通的時候，只有如某書店老闆讀高爾基四十年的中譯本以後怨高爾基的文章寫得不能一樣，把一筆糊塗賬硬算到原著者頭上去。</p>
<p>對於這些莫知所云牛頭不對馬嘴的譯品，我一向抱定［門羅政策，］不僅是不買，而且不看。然而每當發現一部名著被人譯成不知所云的東西的時候，一種無名的惱怒，便禁不住會從心頭浮起。我覺得把人家好好的作品毫無顧惜的糟塌，無論從那一方面說，都是一種不可原恕的罪過。</p>
<p>不過，話說回頭，翻譯界之所以有這種糟現象，也很難怪。第一，中國目前所有一切，無不是遵依着［馬虎主義］，大而至於國事，小而至於私德，都是馬馬虎虎，得過即過。第二是中國社會對文人的報酬太微薄了。目前我國出版界譯品的市價，大槪最高每千字不過五六元，普通則常在兩三元左右，甚至還低到一元半或一元。另一種辦法是抽版稅，最高的亦不過百分之十五。而稿子的賣出，又大抵還全仗有大面子的人介紹，否則無論你譯筆怎樣忠實流利，書店老闆們總是一律謝絕。這樣、生活像一條鞭子慘酷地在背上抽，兒號寒，妻啼饑，吃過了上餐，便不知道下餐，怎能呌人好好譯述？第三是中國今日旣没有學者、亦不容有學者，中國今日所需的以及所有的，是［萬能博士，］是［上</p>
<p>知天文，下知識地理，博古通今，無所不會］的［全材］，學軍事的可以辦敎育，學政治的可以辦交通，學工業的也可以管政治，只要你肯幹，你便無往而不適，反之，假如你抱定宗旨，學工業便只管辦工業，學敎育便只管敎育，那你便會處處碰壁。這種現象侵入翻譯界，那便是不管我學的是什麽，只要兜攬得生意到手，便什麽都大瞻地去譯，學社會科學的固然可以譯關於自然科學的著作，學自然科學的也可譯關於社會科學的著作，理解與否，那個管得？這樣，欲求其譯筆忠實流利，又豈不是有若緣木求魚。</p>
<p>總之今日中國一切都是一圑糟，而此一糟與彼一糟，又都有着不可分離的關聯。在糟做一圑的情形之下，想要翻譯界不糟，想要從事翻譯工作的人不［翻</p>
<p>開第一行就譯，］不［硬譯亂譯］，顯然是不可能，脫更進而求有［對於一種學理作精深刻苦的研究，能指揮如意地應用的學者］，自然，尤其是不可能。</p>
<h3>辯白樸非豪放派</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>任中敏散曲槪論頁三五說··［白樣···豪放之尤者。］</p>
<p>陸侃如馮沅君中國詩史卷下面一二七九說··［白樣······雖也有以豪放名的作品，如歡飲漁父同　作，但究以俊爽秀美者爲多。一　　　　　　鄭振譯中國文學史第四册面九九○說··一他的散曲，俊逸有神，小令尤爲清雋。］</p>
<p>我對於後二書的論斷有大部分的同意，而對於前一書的論斷則持反面的意見。</p>
<p>任中敏所輯元四家散曲，其中白樣有小令三十六首，套數四首，倘若仔細分析每一首散曲，則可以算作豪放派的除了陸馮所　的歡飲和漁父詞外，也只有慶東原第一首，陽春曲知幾四首，（卽這曲子，陸馮且以爲一似豪放而實深婉］）佳人臉上墨痣和對景各一首··一共只有九首，還不到全部散曲的四分之一。所以因這極少數的豪放散曲而斷定白樣爲豪放派，是不妥的。</p>
<p>其餘三十一首都可以歸入清麗一派。其實，我們卽使說他是詠物詩人也未嘗不可。他的散曲大都是無病呻吟之作，很不自然的拈出一些題目來吟詠。我們在這些散曲裏大部分看不出作者生活的反映，題詠春夏秋冬每季一首，竟很有興致的歌吟了三次，一共十二首，吹彈歌舞也各寫一首，題情六首，詠雪一首｜｜詠物的詩這裏已經有了二十三首。（還豪放類的［佳人臉上黑痣］也是詠物的，清麗類的小石調惱煞人詠蘇卿和豪放類的沉醉東風詠漁父這兩首也是客觀的叙述）這二十三首以及慶東原第二三首，德勝命四首，仙吕點綘唇，小石調惱煞人等都是清麗一派。卽就這些風花雪月的題目看來，我們也可以知道在這樣的題材裏是寫不出豪放的曲詞來的，何况又大都是客觀的不動情感的寫景詠物之作呢！莫說豪放之情難以抒寫，就是婉約之情恐怕也難以抒寫吧？</p>
<p>任氏或者是受了王國維的暗示，我想。王國維在宋元戲曲史元劇之文章中說··［仁甫似蘇東坡，］也是同樣不恰當的。卽以戲曲而論，白樣傅世之作如梧桐雨，墙頭馬上等也都屬於清麗派而不屬於豪放派。</p>
<h3>平凡的事（三八）</h3>
<p>— 濬果孫</p>
<p>［這究竟是甚麽人打的？我忙得忘記對你說！］</p>
<p>伯唐想了一會，輕蔑地摇着頭說··</p>
<p>［那還不是壽子春打的｜他昨天不是用快信寄了請帖來嗎！］</p>
<p>［他眞是　空，這個甚麽壽子春！］</p>
<p>［今天那個去理他這頓晚飯！］</p>
<p>話箱子又被四周的空氣問住了，光陰就是這樣一分鐘一分鐘地流過去。忽然，噹噹噹三下，過道　的大時鐘，剛剛報過三點。伯唐側耳一聽，就顯出生立不安的樣子，像是他這個家庭立刻就會受到最後的裁判。他在飯堂裏面一縱一横地走了半天，末了　地在自已頭上拍了一掌，說是··我權且打個電話去問文卿一下。然而結果··文卿却已經出了［行裏］的寫字間。這可呌他更加發急··</p>
<p>［唉｜十分鐘之内，我一定要帶了欵子和［人］，一齊到行裏去了！］［也許並不是在格羅希路和拉菲德路呀！施五哥說，［這難免不就是馬文卿掉的槍花！］</p>
<p>［這也許是對的，］伯唐說，也許是不對的，我現在只希望從速得一個確實的消息。］這時候，一個僕人帶着邱代表進來了，他喜氣忽忽地向伯唐說··</p>
<p>［老板，我們有了消息！</p>
<p>［眞的？］伯唐活潑而又像疑惑地說，［看見了他老人家？］</p>
<p>［没有，不過有人看見了老板的車夫宏發！］</p>
<p>［那個看見的？］</p>
<p>［廠裏的卡車夫春山。］</p>
<p>［在那裏看見的？］</p>
<p>［在八仙橋。］</p>
<p>［甚麽時候？］</p>
<p>［兩點鐘模樣。］</p>
<p>［春山怎樣看見宏發的呢？］</p>
<p>［春山在八仙橋一家飯館裏吃飯，碰巧宏發也在那裏，他問宏發從那裏來，宏發說是一早就送了老老板到重慶路，連車子照例都放在那裏，自已就抽身出來，找了一個地方睡了一覺，現在餓了所以就來吃飯。］</p>
<p>［他們没有談旁的事嗎？］</p>

<p>非武力能解决的問題  樸　　日前記者接到一位朋友從綏遠寄來的一封信·關於察綏沿途的情形有這樣的一段叙述··［七日離平赴張家口調查皮毛市塲曁農村經濟狀况。張家口爲通外蒙孔道，民十七以前内外蒙皮毛之來張家口者，所約一千四五百萬元，國貨集於張家口轉銷外蒙者，年約一千萬左右，民十七自中俄絕交以後，外蒙皮毛來源斷絕，國貨亦無法運銷外蒙，於是張家口市塲，由三千萬元一降而至二三百萬元。市面蕭條，金融枯滯，理之當然，兼之荷捐雜稅，匪梳兵剃。大多數人民已入於求生不能，求死所而不得的情境，於是一班民衆心理已爲之大變，思想日趨於怨毒仇恨之一途矣！此種心理之改變，乃實際的環境逼迫而成，欲謀補救，則唯有從改善此實際的環境入手，决非用武力壓迫所能奏效者也！再由張家口而大同而豐鎭而平地泉而轉入綏遠，沿途所見，更是慘不忍睹。民十六七八三年大旱的結果，單豐鎭一地女子，運賣入關内者，即逾萬人，餓死者難計數。在平地泉參觀綏遠省立第二師範學校，適值學生午餐時問，見每桌學生八人，僅有蒿苣一碗，所食麵飯，係莜麥麫，粗糙色黯，難以下嚥。長江下游，猪之飼，料，猶較此爲佳，而此間中等學生，且甘之如飴。中等學生之飲食如此，一般平民之食品更可設想矣！］　　最近察哈爾的張家口，因馮玉祥氏的抗日問題，引起國内外人士極大注意與憂懼，而於該處歷年來的商業衰落，天災人禍所造成的人民悲慘情形，却反毫未引起政府當道的垂察而積極的加以補救。我以爲這是自有民國以來，政府不能取得國民信賴與擁護的唯一原因。注意大衆的痛苦，力謀所以減少大衆的痛苦，這是一個立在革命立塲的政府應立刻進行的唯一工作，若是忽略了此點，則無論這政府有如何動人的宣傅，全屬不切實際的具文，時日稍久，就要拆穿西洋鏡，不值一文錢了。　　此次馮玉祥氏的稱兵抗日，何以反遭中央政府的反對，其中眞相，至今未明，我們殊不願有所判斷，况且事已結束，將來自有大白的一天。現在我們所要請政府注意的，就是武力的反抗，或可以用武力征服之，但是大多數民衆因爲没有飯吃而發生的反抗，却决非武力所能解决的事。近年來，政府雖日言建設而建設毫無，代政府說話的人，總以剿匪成討伐什麽人，什麽人爲藉口，但是許多没有匪没有討伐的地方如江浙等省的建設成績又在那裏呢？這是我們要站在純粹輿論的立塲，希望政府切實注意的一個根本問題。人們的口號應當是··　　［積極的準備抗日！積極的實行民生主義！］對今後的察哈爾的外交内政應如此，對今後全國的外交内政亦應如此。生活一個個數字一件件事實  竹　　成衣匠　　全上海的成衣舗，大約有八九千爿，成衣匠至少在四五萬人以上，以蘇州，揚州，常州，諸曁，寗波，天台，紹興，上海各帮爲最多數。較大的成衣舗，老板就頂一幢房子，工作塲設在客堂間，墙邊放着兩排工作台，（成衣匠夜間就睡在上面）僱有成衣匠三四人至十餘人工作。小的成衣舗，僅租一間房子，夫妻二人合作，而不僱成衣工人。　　各成衣舗奉軒轅皇帝爲祖師，組有上海市成衣舗同業工會（設在城裏軒轅廟）。成衣舗的老板必需加入工會，每季交納會費兩角，即爲成衣工會的會員。各帮成衣匠旣無其他的組織，也不加入工會，但内中有不少是拜老頭子的。　　各成衣舗僱用成衣匠，以按日給資爲最普通，看工人手藝的高下，而定工資的標準。大槪按日給資的，每月平均工資爲十一二元，供給膳宿。按件給資的，每件衣服的工錢是成衣匠和老板對分，譬如絲綢的旗袍或大衫，成衣匠每日可做一件，工錢爲兩元四角，成衣匠得一元二角，老板也得一元二角，合計每月可得工資二十餘元，但成衣匠每月要付飯費六元，電燈費一元。以工作時間論，按日給資的成衣匠，每日在十小時左右，年邊節氣工作忙的時候，則在十一二小時以上；按件給資的工作時間，那就没有一定了。各成衣舗除了幾個大節日停工一二天外，一年到頭並無其他的休息日。　　成衣舗的老板，不一定是成衣匠出身。有些開着成衣舗自已做别的職業，有些專靠剥削成衣匠而生活，但也有許多是從成衣匠出身的。成衣匠與老板的關係，以同鄉居多，正因這種關係，而一任老板剥削榨取。老板對於他們工資，是三三兩兩地發給，總没有按月照發的。固然，每件衣服的工錢不一定立即可以拏到（做衣服較多的人家，每年在端午，中秋，年底三期付錢的居多），　　但平時衣工的收入，已夠開銷了。至於成衣匠暫時拏到的幾元錢，就在老板所設的賭具上交還他了。所以每個成衣匠除了吃飯睡覺以外，就給老板工作，自已拏不到多少工錢。　　我覺得手工業的成衣匠，其所費的勞力雖然没有機器旁邊的產業工人那樣的大，但成衣舗老板的剥削方法，與工廠主並無差異，而成衣匠所受的苦痛，也不亞於工廠中的工人！安樂窩巨獸  陳生路　　大飯店　　擦得透亮的銅招牌。［××大飯店］烏漆漆五個斗大的字，管門巡捕的臉也是烏漆漆的。　　抬起腦袋，一層，二層，三層······七層，凸着肚子，張着嘴，嚇人的｜晚上，把一批批男女呑進肚去啦，明兒，再把那些嚼膩了的男女吐出來，吐出來，誰都没一股勁兒，誰都是張着青灰色的臉。　　慢些兒，大飯店裹的活劇儘多着。這兒没有青菜頭腐糙米飯，這兒本是哥兒小姐的尋樂塲。媽的｜你是窮光蛋，一把摔你在街心。　　慢些兒，大飯店裹的活劇儘多着。二樓｜｜白的燈光，白的房門，油光光的地板，白衣侍者在堂口那兒打哈哈，電鈴｜滴鈴鈴······　　三樓｜｜白的燈光，白的房門，油光光的地板，白衣侍者在堂口那兒打哈哈，電鈴｜滴鈴鈴·····　　四樓｜五樓｜·····電鈴｜滴鈴鈴。雅片的氣息，肉的氣息，猪排的氣</p>

<p>新的創痕  陸振　　好漢　　自從有了［國離］以來，國内頻添了不少漢奸；不幸的我，也是其中之一。　　說也惭愧，這時候我還要在一家日本工廠	裏當小職員，做着我不願做的事，自已也曉得這是絕對的不該。我是大衆的罪人，我是漢奸！　　我還很清楚的記得··在［五卅］慘案發生的時候，我正在一家英國洋行裏當練習生；那時節，全行的華員莫不切齒痛恨英帝國主義的暴行，一致自動的捲了舗蓋滾蛋，不替英國人做工作了。我肘掣的動行東樂　　也顧不到生活，顧不到一切，跟着大家走上了前途茫茫的反帝國主義的大道。雖然此後幾年以内，我是受盡了流浪生活的苦痛，然而我的精神却是煥發而快樂的，我會挻胸突肚的在跌上昻首邁進，我會在大衆面前爭回我光榮的勝利！　　一九二八年的秋天，承一個朋友的介紹，到這日本工廠裏來當小職員，屈指計算起來，不覺巳有四年多了。在這四年有零的生活史上，我仍然留下了不知多少，比先前更悲痛的創痕，其中，尤以［九一八］事變中的一頁最爲深刻，這一頁，就决定了我漢奸的命運。　　東三省失陷的惡耗傅來，震碎了全國人脆弱的心靈。在我們廠裏的職員當中，雖然有許多死心塌地甘心媚日的走狗，但血未冷，心未死的人們，斃竟不在少數，於是我們就很快的醖釀着［五卅］時代的老把戲，我們開始活動了！可是，出於意料之外的，我們的工廠雖在湖北×市華界，我們這批人雖然是中國人，我們的行動却得不到有力的保護；甚至當我們一切都巳準備好了的這天早上，我們的組織是被高等華人所摧殘自我職業介紹回音　　朱更生先生；有事相煩，請來面試。（狄思威路新小菜場斜對過裕新里三十二號洋房中華基督醫院王惠靈啓）　　余女士，雲女士，瑛女士及沈瑾號二樓與張秀琳女士接洽。（李文芳啓）　　李潔如女士··請卽駕臨東百老滙路八○六號遠東公司一談。（蔡丙南啓）　　瑛女士··擬請女士担任家庭敎師，如願就，卽請移玉虹口通州路賢慶里一九一號接洽。（魏秀英啓）　　雲女士··擬請女士担任家庭敎師，如願就，卽請駕臨一談。（福熙路明德里三十一號浦宅啓）　　沈瑾女士··請向下列各處接洽··㈠靜安寺路福源里二號方宅··㈡羅店書院街觀瀾中學··及㈢梅白格路一百十一號鞠文耀女士。　　了。從此，我們的計劃將永遠成爲計劃，而我們幾顆血淋淋的赤心，也就掉在冰窖裏淹死了。我們開始變成漢奸的羣，我們把自已的命運送上死路。　　因爲我不是個人主義者，也不是英雄主義的信徒，更不願單獨地［潔身自好］，我總要守候着活動機會之到來，所以我祇得寄生在日本資本家的領域中，冒着［漢奸］［媚外］的大罪。我是忍受了一切的譏笑，一切的咒駡，一切的不名譽。我是漢奸，然而，誰呌我做漢奸啊？我却茫然！小小專著介紹國家主義  唐寅　　國家主義，在中國雖有好久的歷史，但牠是一個什麽東西，却很少爲人理解，所以不是被人誇成至上，便被人鄙視得不足一道。可是這種主觀的偏見，無論他對於國家主義認爲是好或壞，他於國家主義的本質上，仍然是没有多大的損益的。　　然則國家主義的本質爲何？一般說來，國家主義是與國家有密切關係的，換言之，没有國家，便不會有國家主義，所以要明瞭國家主義，必先了解國家。在國家主義者看來，國家基本的要素，就是組織，因爲國家的形式，無論從古至今是怎樣的變遷，牠的唯一的要素｜｜組織｜｜是不能免的。其次，國家的存在，是因其有下列幾個因素，即··第一是自然環境的一至；第二是政治環境的一致；第三是歷史精神的一致。假使這三種因素不能互相一致，那麽，便不會造成獨立的國家。且社會的進展，促進了人類的自覺，於是由無意識的推進國家，變爲有意識的了。國家的意識旣經成立，對於國家的觀念也就發展，那因此而成爲有系統的理想者，便是國家主義。　　所以國家主義，無論在行何方面，都離不了國家。興認爲在現今以强凌弱的世界，一個國家要能維持其獨立的存在，就必須要自强自救。所謂自强自救，是要自已也能夠成爲列强之一，不須第三者的帮助，全靠自已拯救自已。因之，在内必須求得統一，在外要求得到獨立。所以對内主張排除國賊，對外主張抵抗强權。但除國賊抗强權與打倒軍閥打倒帝國主義不同，因爲軍閥不能包括一切國賊，所以國家主義不以打倒軍閥爲號召，同樣，打倒帝國主義是在根本推翻列强，取消資本主義制度，代之以新的社會主義制度，而外抗强權則在保護本國，只對侵略本國者抗而遠之。至於國家主義的政治理想，乃以全民政治爲目標，即上自資本家下至勞工，大家一起合治。　　以上便是關於國家主義本質的一個槪念。自不待說，各國的國家主義因爲環境的差異，也有彼此互異的地方，但牠的革本特點，大致是没有出入的。然而有些人說··國家主義希圖自已的民族優越，而排斥其他的民族，以爲自已的國家至高無上，這不過是封建領土觀念的遺風。且在今日帝國主義壟斷之下，全世界的領土早被分割凈盡，而帝國主義自身間的矛盾尙在日益加深，大有促成第二次世界大戰的爆發，實行世界的領土再度分割之勢。另一方面，全世界被壓迫階級及弱小民族的覺醒，也將再不甘受帝國主義的壓迫。聯合一致，堅决實行反帝國主義的鬥爭，已成了被壓迫者解放運動的唯一不二的途徑。所以國家主義在今日尙圖富國强兵，造成一個帝國主義，那不過是牠的幻夢而巳但究竟國家主義是好是壞，我個人未敢輕下判斷，且讓事實去加以决定吧！</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Telegraphs That Zhangjiakou Is Peaceful As Usual</h3>
<h3>Pang's Troops, Two Regiments, Advanced to Zhangjiakou, Guan's Division Reached Near Xuanhua</h3>
<h3>There Is a Rumor of Mutiny Among Li Zhongyi's Troops Near Xuanhua</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegraphs: "Song Zheyuan, Jiang Bocheng, at 12:20 PM, arrived at Zhangjiakou station by special train. Liu's regiment provided security. Over two hundred people welcomed them. Feng's representative, Deng Zhexi, greeted them at the station. Zhangjiakou city was plastered with slogans welcoming Chairman Song for his hard work and great merit in resisting Japan. After Song and Jiang alighted from the train, they went to the provincial government for rest. In the afternoon, Song visited Feng at Xin Village. Upon meeting, they were filled with emotion. They talked for over thirty minutes. Feng stated that he had already telegraphed that he would not interfere in the affairs of Chahar. The reason he had not left Zhangjiakou was to wait for Song. Now that Song had arrived, he would live in seclusion in the deep mountains and return to a life of reading. Xiao Zhenying, on the evening of the 12th, returned to Beiping on Song's orders to visit He and report on the situation in Chahar Province." (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Jiang Bocheng, Pang Bingxun, and others, arrived in Zhangjiakou by special train this afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou. After arriving in Zhangjiakou this afternoon, Song Zheyuan sent a telegram stating, "To all newspaper offices: I, Zheyuan, entered Zhangjiakou at noon on the 12th. Zhangjiakou is now peaceful as usual. I respectfully report this and await your instructions. Song Zheyuan, respectful salute." (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After receiving Song's telegram on the 12th reporting his entry into Zhangjiakou, Huang Fu replied, "Having read your telegram of the 12th, I respectfully acknowledge that my brother has entered Zhangjiakou. The military and political affairs of Chahar Province all depend on your leadership and control. Looking west to the Great Wall, I am filled with joy." (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two regiments of Pang's troops advanced to Zhangjiakou yesterday. Guan Linzheng's division has also reached the vicinity of Xuanhua. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Jingjiu arrived in Beiping this morning and immediately went to Kangzhuang to take up defense duties. His troops are stationed in the Kangzhuang and Xinzhuangzi area. Wang said, "Apart from Fu's brigade, which is currently stationed in Xiahuayuan and Xinzhuangzi, most of the rebellious troops are still stationed in Kangzhuang. The troops of Pang, Guan, and Feng have been advancing in order. The future of Chahar is optimistic." (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou reports: Fang Zhenwu went to Wanquan to establish the headquarters of the National Salvation Army. There are reports of a mutiny among Li Zhongyi's righteous army near Xuanhua. Li urgently went to Xuanhua on the morning of the 12th. (Telegram on the 12th) (Beiping) The 25th Division of the Central Army opened to Xuanhua on the morning of the 12th. Guan Linzheng established his division headquarters upon arrival in Xuanhua. Today, Sun Liangcheng's troops moved to Shangdu to support Duolun. (Special dispatch on the 12th) (Beiping) Someone from Zhangjiakou said, "Sun Liangcheng's troops have retreated to the vicinity of Chaigoubao. Fang Zhenwu's troops have retreated to Zhangbei. Currently, the troops remaining in Zhangjiakou include Tong Zhiyi's regiment and Feng's guard regiment. Feng still resides in the Xin Village headquarters. The security of Zhangjiakou is jointly maintained by Feng Zhian's division and Tong Linge. Feng sent Deng Zhexi to Song, Qin, and others, stating that Feng's personal situation was not a problem, but his subordinates hoped that Song would handle them well and find a way to settle them. Therefore, Deng, Qin, and others are very busy traveling between Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. Song himself cannot make the decisions and must ask the Military Affairs Committee and the Central Government for instructions. Jiang Bocheng arrived in Xuanhua last night and immediately consulted with Song, Pang, and others. Currently, both sides are still in communication through representatives to negotiate. Once a proper solution is reached, they will go to Zhangjiakou with him to meet Feng." (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng went to Xuanhua yesterday to discuss the aftermath of Chahar affairs with Song, Pang, and others. Qin Dechun and Deng Zhexi also went to Zhangjiakou to meet Feng and discuss Feng's residence after leaving Zhangjiakou. A decision has been made: Feng will still live in Xin Village and will leave Zhangjiakou after meeting Song. Regarding the aftermath of Chahar's affairs, it was decided to handle them according to the Military Affairs Committee's predetermined policy. All righteous armies that have been inspected and given a certain designation by the Military Affairs Committee will be allowed to maintain their original establishment. However, the various miscellaneous troops newly organized by Feng will be separately reorganized and disbanded by Song. As for Song's request to the Central Government to appoint Pang as the head of Chahar, it was intended as a gesture of humility. Pang will still serve as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Chahar Province. At 10:00 AM this morning, He Zeng invited the three division commanders of Song's troops, Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, and Liu Ruming, to Jurentang to discuss matters related to Chahar. It was decided that the troops of Pang Bingxun, Xu Tingyao, and Guan Linzheng would stop at Xuanhua for the time being and not advance north. The security of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua will be jointly maintained by Tong Linge and Song's troops. Song, Jiang, and others are scheduled to leave Xuanhua for Zhangjiakou this morning to meet Feng."

<h3>War Zone After Recovery Is Filled With Bandits</h3>
<p>Xue Zhiheng Was To Handle Clearing Operations, But The Japanese Suddenly Wanted To Intervene And Take Over</p>
<p>(Beiping) The war zones are filled with bandits. Yu Xuezhong had a face-to-face discussion on ways to eliminate them and planned to have Xue Zhiheng handle the clearing operations, including: 1. Transferring Li Jichun's troops; 2. Incorporating them into a special police force; 3. Unifying the people's militias in various counties; 4. Appropriately forming a clearing operation police force. The above four forces would be under Xue's command and responsible for clearing operations in the war zone. However, this plan has not been finalized. After Yu went south, he handed it over to Wei Jian to continue planning. During this period, the Japanese suddenly declared that if our side did not have effective measures against bandits along the border, the Japanese were willing to eliminate them themselves. The county heads of the Luandong counties stated that since the war zone had already been recovered, each had their own responsibilities and should not trouble outsiders to intervene and take over. They requested instructions from the authorities to determine the measures. Wei then planned to appoint Du Fengfeng and Tian Futting as clearing operation commissioners. If Du and Tian do not accept, then the administrative inspector will concurrently handle it. However, the people of Yongzun and other counties still hope that the government will establish a policy as soon as possible and do not want former military personnel to handle the clearing operations.

This afternoon, Yin, Liu, Lei, Tao Shangming, and others visited He Yingqin to report on the war zone recovery and Beining traffic negotiations. Liu Shisun said that the recovery of traffic on the Tang-Yu section of the Beining Railway was achieved after Yin Tong went to Shenyang and negotiated with Colonel Hougong, which was very satisfactory. Therefore, they came to Ping to report on the negotiations. It was decided to restore direct passenger trains from Ping to Yu on the 13th. The commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tangshan, Gaoqi, retreated to Guanwai at 9 AM this morning. All Japanese trains and soldiers from Tangshan to Yu had also been completely withdrawn, with only a part of the garrison stationed between Tangshan, Qindao, and Yu Pass. The negotiations with the Japanese side were conducted entirely in accordance with the traffic recovery plan formulated at the Dalian Conference and did not involve political issues. As a result of the negotiations, it was first decided to restore railway traffic to the state before the incident, and then to proceed with other matters, such as joint transportation, after the traffic was restored. In addition, bandits are harassing everywhere in the Qian'an and Lulong areas. After the recovery of all traffic, measures will be taken to suppress them. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

The new county magistrate is now going from Tang to take over. Xinglong County, because the banditry is very bad, the county magistrate has not gone to take over. Other Dushan County and part of Long County outside the Great Wall must be determined based on future negotiations. Li Jichun's puppet army has been reorganized and will be stationed in Fengrun and Luanxian. Li is still in Tangshan. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Bursts Its Banks, Frequent Warning Signals, Several Breaches Near Changyuan Again</h3>
<h3>Han Orders All Counties Under Cao To Defend The Water, Water Reaches Lanfeng, Will Take The Old Course, Jiangsu Provincial Government Sends An Urgent Telegram To The Central Government</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Heze County Magistrate Sun Zirang telegraphed that several breaches occurred on the north bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan on the 11th, with the breaches being several li wide. At the same time, a breach occurred in Erfen Village, Dongming County, on the opposite bank at noon on the 11th, with the breach reaching over thirty zhang. The water head passed Dongming City at night and is now flowing into Heze County, with the initial water head being over a zhang high. It is still seven or eight chi high in Shandong, and the Zhukou water has risen more than a chi and is still rising sharply. I am afraid that Liuzhuang and Zhukou will be in danger. I am doing my best to protect them. In addition, Chen Wenmo, the chief of the upstream section, has led workers to Zhukou again to prevent problems. The Li Sheng Tun dangerous works have been mobilized to strictly guard against them. If necessary, bricks and stones will be used to compress and sweep them. Although the breach is in Hebei, the terrain of this province is low, and it has always flooded the eight counties of Caozhou, Heze, etc. After receiving the telegram, Han immediately ordered all counties under Caozhou to prepare 20,000 sacks to prevent blockage and ordered all villages to rush to repair encirclements to defend against water. After previous breaches, the river water must have fallen. This morning, the upstream water still rose sharply by 4.9 inches. The magnitude of the water is unprecedented. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Pinghan Railway's office in Beiping received a report stating that at 4 PM on the 10th, the water level of the Yellow River Railway Bridge changed suddenly. From the first hole to the twenty-ninth hole of the bridge, it completely turned into sediment. From the sixtieth hole to the ninetieth hole, the water was turbulent. The bridge piers were scoured by the water, and the seventy-seventh and seventy-eighth holes of the bridge piers were scoured toward the east with an inclination of about 2 inches. The situation is critical. The current depth of the river reaches 86 meters and is increasing. It is extremely serious. Urgently transport consolation stones and send an engineering team to block and rescue, etc. The railway bureau has sent engineers to rush to protect the piers. Damage to the piers will make it difficult to resume traffic within three to five days. It is heard that the railway bureau will switch to water transport, with the train arriving at Zhan Dian Ferry, crossing the river by boat, and then transferring to a train on the south bank to go to Hanzhong. (Special dispatch on the 12th) (Jinan) Pu County Magistrate telegraphed that the breaches in Changyuan were at the Shitouzhuang and Dasuozhuang areas. One, which was more than ten zhang wide, has been blocked, and another, which was more than sixty zhang wide, is being repaired. The river water flows to the Wei Shang irrigation area of Yuhua County in Henan and has not yet reached Shandong. The river bureau is actively transporting materials to prevent the breach water from coming east. This morning, all three reaches of the Yellow River rose. At noon, the Ping Shui level was 29.9 meters at Luokou. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Chairman of Henan Province recently telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to report on the flooding situation of the Yellow River and to find ways to prevent it. The original telegram stated, "The Yellow River has risen by fourteen feet, the embankments are overflowing, and the water has reached under the city of Lanfeng, fearing that it will take the old course of the Yellow River. The lives and property of the people in the lower reaches are of great importance. It is hoped that measures will be taken to defend it." After receiving the telegram, the Jiangsu Provincial Government believed that the flood waters would definitely cause breaches and that the water would reach Lanfeng and return to its old course. (There are no plateaus to block below Lanfeng, and the old dikes have already collapsed, which will inevitably cause flooding.) Or it will move south and enter the Huai River. If so, Jiangsu Province will be doomed. With a catastrophe imminent, the matter is extremely urgent. It has urgently telegraphed the Central Government to send officials quickly, and has also telegraphed the Huai River Guidance Committee and the Anhui and Henan Provincial Governments to each send commissioners to go to investigate and defend against the floods together with the Jiangsu Provincial Commissioner. At the same time, it ordered Tongshan She Commissioner to urgently gather manpower from Tong, Feng, Pei, Dang, and other counties to quickly defend and also telegraph the water situation to the province for reference.

<p>More Than Three Thousand Acres Of Good Farmland Were Flooded, And Baodi And Fengrun Also Had Breaches</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The trenches that were previously rebuilt on the banks of the Suyun River have not yet been filled. Mountain floods suddenly arrived.

<h3>Distribution of Cotton and Wheat Loans Requires Consideration</h3>
<p>Will Be Resolved After Song Returns To China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The first batch of cotton and wheat has been scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States in early October. The Central Bank will receive it according to the order. Regarding the overall distribution of the problem, after Song returns to China, it will be submitted to the Central Political Committee for detailed consultation, and then the distribution will be allocated according to urgency. However, the Guangdong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provincial governments and legal groups have all sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the requested number be included in the appropriation when the distribution plan is submitted to facilitate development. In addition, the construction of water conservancy and farmland and the relief of bankrupt and impoverished rural areas, and the applications for relief from other provinces are also endless. There is little porridge and many monks, and the distribution will definitely be cumbersome. The government is now considering establishing a standard based on the urgent needs of certain construction production and relief, and then handling it according to this policy. After the cotton and wheat transported later arrive in Shanghai, they will be directly transported to various places without being stored for turnover to avoid hoarding and consumption. Because our country's machinery is underdeveloped, the land reward rate and rural productivity are weakening, and wasteland is everywhere. The government has no ambition to promote the opening of customs, and the people are limited by their resources and cannot start. The League of Nations recently based on the results of the Chinese Cooperation and Investigation Report Statistics, the country has a total of 120 million hectares of wasteland, such as the opening and closing of the profits, the minimum annual increase in income of 1 million yuan, the land tax can increase the income of 100 million yuan.

After the takeover, the various antiquities will be actually cleared, and the corruption case can be clarified. The case of Yi Peiji and others is being investigated and handled by the Jiangning District Court. The accusation against the principals of the Forbidden City this time is purely due to internal discord, so it has caused public opinion. Yu is also one of the directors of the Palace Museum, and deeply feels sorry for the society. The saying that the antique books in Shanghai are born of moths is not accurate. The Fifth Plenary Session is scheduled to be held as scheduled.</p>

<h3>Japan Contemplates Annexing Nine Small Islands of Guangdong</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministry Collecting Evidence for Legal Research</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding France's recent occupation of several islands in the South China Sea, Japan is disputing their ownership. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is currently gathering evidence. Dr. Baty of the Foreign Ministry and Professor Tatsuo Arima of Tokyo Imperial University, both experts in international law, are studying the initial discovery of these islands from a legal perspective. Recent evidence favorable to Japan's claim comes from another professor at Tokyo Imperial University, who presented a map drawn in 1553, proving the location of these islands. This evidence refutes France's claim that the islands were discovered by the French within the last hundred years. Furthermore, several new pieces of evidence have been discovered, including an old screen from two hundred years ago with a map depicting these islands, though not by name. There is also a map drawn several hundred years ago in China by an Italian priest, which also marks these islands. Recent investigations have uncovered various stories involving Japanese people. All this evidence will be included in Japan's argument for claiming the islands. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry states that it does not want to determine Japan's actual stance on the ownership of these islands until the investigations by Dr. Baty and Dr. Arima are complete.

<h3>Soviet Government Focuses on Developing the Far East</h3>
<p>The territory of the Soviet Far East, including the Koryak Plain Peninsula west of the Kolyma River and bordering the Bering Sea to the east, spans an area of 700,000 square li. Most of this area has not yet been surveyed, and there are no reliable maps. Currently, an expedition team led by Professor Obruchev, with the renowned pilot Mr. Struaberg piloting a large aircraft, is en route to survey the area and create an accurate map.

<h3>Illegal Sales of the Chinese Eastern Railway Continue in Private Meetings</h3>
<p>Russian Side Proposes Considering Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Agreement Already Reached Between France and Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The second private meeting regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway began at 8:30 this morning. Mr. Ohashi, Deputy Director from the puppet state, and Messrs. Cavrovsky and Krzhizhanovsky from the Soviet Russian side attended, discussing for four hours. During the meeting, the Russian side proposed reviewing the ruble exchange rate issue, which was accepted by the [puppet] side. Therefore, the third private meeting, scheduled for the 15th, is expected to see considerable progress.</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a report from a correspondent in Harbin for [The Final News], the president of the Russo-Asiatic Bank, Mr. Masle, recently stayed briefly in Tokyo and reached an agreement with the Japanese side. Japan will recognize the shares of French nationals within the capital of the Chinese Eastern Railway, to a certain extent. Masle achieved this result by offering Japan an exchange condition: the French side will organize a capital group to provide the necessary capital to Japan to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet Union. In the future, the French capital group will send representatives to participate in the management of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (Havas report, 11th)</p>
<h3>Future of Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>Suzuki Refuses Unconditional Entry into the Cabinet</p>
<p>The Minseito Party Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Suzuki, former president of the Seiyukai Party, who was in Yugawara to entertain party elders, arrived at Kyobashi Station in Tokyo at 10:20 this morning. Mr. Suzuki said in the train, "Prime Minister Saito said he would come to see me, and I will meet him when he comes. However, I won't know what we'll discuss until we meet. If it's an unconditional entry into the cabinet, it will be difficult to accept. Abstract policy agreements are meaningless. I need concrete agreements on how to establish finances and to what extent to strengthen military preparedness. But I won't present impossible demands. Now is not the time for ministers without portfolios, and I will not act without principles like a prostitute." (Dentsu report, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito Party has adopted a wait-and-see attitude regarding the issue of ministers without portfolios. However, summarizing the opinions of the executive members, they have informally expressed the following attitude: "Whether the entry of the presidents of two parties with differing ideologies into the cabinet can strengthen the cabinet requires thorough research within the cabinet. Even if negotiations for entry into the cabinet are held, it is highly doubtful whether Mr. Suzuki will agree, based on past relations. The Minseito Party has always supported the cabinet with sincerity. It seems unnecessary to ask Elder Yamamoto to replace President Wakatsuki in the cabinet. If Mr. Suzuki does enter the cabinet, our party will need to carefully consult before deciding on our attitude. Even if Mr. Suzuki's entry into the cabinet is realized, it is merely a domestic strategy of the Seiyukai Party, and only rescues Mr. Suzuki. It is doubtful whether it can strengthen the cabinet." (Dentsu report, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government's attitude towards establishing ministers without portfolios has become more active since Minister of Education Hatoyama visited Prime Minister Saito on the 10th. As a result of the consultation between Saito and Chief Cabinet Secretary Horikiri last night, it seems that the general direction has been decided as follows: "Although the government leaders cannot prejudge the situation within the Seiyukai Party on this issue, the purpose of establishing ministers without portfolios is to once again recognize the extraordinary situation. With this in mind, we sincerely request the presidents of both parties to enter the cabinet. They should not be constrained by party affairs and should readily agree. Minister of Education Hatoyama's advice to the Prime Minister is also largely in this vein. Prime Minister Saito confided in the Finance Minister, saying that although a section of the Seiyukai Party insists that policy agreements should be a prerequisite, in order to open up difficult situations for re-recognizing the current extraordinary situation, we should base ourselves on political parties and seek to strengthen the cabinet. When negotiating for entry into the cabinet, he will strongly advocate inviting the presidents of both parties to enter the cabinet and listen to the opinions of the Finance Minister. The Prime Minister strongly emphasized the re-recognition of the extraordinary situation, which concerns the international difficulties since withdrawing from the League of Nations, the establishment of national defense countermeasures, and the establishment of Japan's financial and economic policies after the failure of the World Economic Conference. If the presidents of the two major parties agree with the government on the above matters, misunderstandings can be eliminated, and they should not refuse to enter the cabinet. Without being bound by the details of policies, we can achieve full effectiveness in this extraordinary time and restore the credibility of political parties. Therefore, the Prime Minister will meet with the Finance Minister on the 13th and then begin negotiations for entry into the cabinet." (Dentsu report, 12th)</p>
<h3>Incident of the Seizure of Puppet Ships</h3>
<p>Japan Incites Puppet State to Protest to Russia</p>
<p>Accusing Them of Damaging Shipping Agreements</p>
<p>(Harbin) The puppet government is currently protesting to the Soviet Russian government regarding the incident on June 29 when a Soviet Russian gunboat searched the puppet ship [Dongshan] and abducted ten White Russians. The protest was delivered this morning by [puppet] Foreign Ministry representative Shi Luben to Soviet Russian Consul Slavoski. The following demands were also made: 1) Immediately release the abducted people. 2) Punish the Soviet Russian political investigation bureau personnel responsible for this incident. 3) The Soviet Russian government should apologize and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. The protest also pointed out that this incident has damaged the shipping agreement signed in 1929 regarding the Ussuri River, Amur River, and AiHui River, as the agreement stipulates that armed guards should not cross the river boundary. According to the puppet government's account of the incident, one of the Soviet Russian passengers on the [Dongshan] reported to the Soviet Russian secret investigation bureau of Fan Silivasovsky that the Dongshan was carrying Soviet Russian armed immigrants. Afterwards, the secret investigation bureau sent people on a gunboat to cross the Ussuri River boundary and board the Dongshan ship, demanding that the captain disarm the immigrants and hand over all the immigrants. The captain, being isolated and helpless, handed over all the immigrants, including Prince Erkotansky and others, who were forcibly taken back to Russian territory. According to the latest news from Soviet Russia, Prince Erkotansky and his entourage will be charged with treason. (Reuters report, 12th)</p>
<h3>Songhua River Water Rises</h3>

<h3>Righteous Army Attacks Jihui Road at Night</h3>

<p>Foreigners Secretly Photographing Terrain Outside Omura Bay in Kyushu, Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Military Police Department received a report stating that in recent days, strange foreigners have often been seen wandering along the coast of Omura Bay in Kyushu, secretly photographing the terrain and surveying the coast in detail. They also seemed to be trying to investigate the secrets related to the launching of torpedoes by the mine warfare unit. Their behavior is suspicious. However, the whereabouts of these foreigners are unknown. Upon receiving the information, the military police immediately ordered all military police stations nationwide to search for their whereabouts in order to investigate the truth. It is rumored that these foreigners are French nationals who have resided in Japan for 18 years and whose movements have long been under surveillance. It is also rumored that they are Americans. Japanese military and police almost universally view foreigners as military spies. (Hualian report, 12th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Difficulties After the Opening of the Pingyu Railway - By Du</h3>
<p>The issue of opening the Pingyu Railway has been finally resolved today after many twists, turns and negotiations. This undoubtedly brings considerable satisfaction to the general public who have been eagerly awaiting it. People like Yin Tong and Liu Shisun, who have been directly involved in the negotiations, have worked tirelessly and deserve praise for their efforts. However, one aspect that makes us uneasy and fills us with countless anxieties is the fact that the national interest is at stake. It is difficult to regard traitors as negotiation partners, and whether the puppet regime was given the opportunity to intervene in previous negotiations and how future negotiations will be handled is a major issue that deserves attention.</p>
<p>The puppet organization incubated by the Japanese has already been denied recognition by the Special Assembly of the League of Nations. The recently announced notice from the League of Nations Advisory Committee provides clear regulations on the denial of [Manchukuo]. It is particularly vigilant in preventing any loopholes or pretexts. Item 4 of the regulations states: "It is not prohibited for nationals of member states to enter into contractual relationships with anyone within Manchuria... However, whether to draw the attention of nationals to the special risks associated with accepting such assignments or mandates should be decided by each member state." Item 6 states: "Under the current circumstances, sending consuls does not imply recognition of [Manchukuo]. These representatives are actually set up to report to the government and protect overseas Chinese... Each government should remind its consuls... to avoid any behavior that could be interpreted as an expression of recognition of that authority as a legitimate government." All of this is intended to avoid any suspicion of tacit recognition and to block the other party's absurd excuses. Member states of the League of Nations, acting as third parties, are so thorough and meticulous in their desire to maintain justice and their own status, and do not want to be easily criticized for losing their composure. As the party concerned, feeling the pain firsthand, we should be even more cautious and avoid getting involved. However, there are facts that make it difficult for us to feel relieved. The Japanese, unable to sell their conspiracy to the League of Nations, have turned to seek flaws in us. They are using every possible means to find opportunities to force us to engage with the puppet regime and use this as comparative data. With their skillful schemes and urgent plans, in addition to outright seizure and plunder, they are employing many tactics of intelligent inducement and manipulation. If we are not careful, we can easily fall into their trap. Once things go wrong, they can easily use the established facts to sow discord in the League of Nations, and we, already exhausted, will be plunged into an abyss from which we cannot escape. Nothing is more alarming than this.</p>
<p>Regarding the resumption of traffic on the Pingyu Railway, the method was decided at the Dalian Conference. However, the delay in the withdrawal of Japanese troops within the customs has led to the shelving of the already agreed proposal. When our representatives negotiated with the Japanese in Shanhaiguan a few days ago, the Japanese unexpectedly demanded that the Beining Railway run directly to Shenyang and the puppet Fengshan Railway run directly to Beiping. Is this sudden proposal due to the Japanese side's sincere desire to restore the entire railway? The Japanese are good at destruction and do not care about the convenience of merchants. Moreover, the entire Beining Railway has been blocked for a long time. Why would they suddenly hope to restore it to its normal state in a short period of time? Is it due to the Japanese side's stubborn adherence to its arrogant policy? The Tanggu Agreement did not include this scope, so there is no prejudice to speak of. Their temporary fabrication and cunning scheme is to lure us into a trap. If we think about it for a moment, we can easily see their intention. The Pingzheng 整 Association also seems to have seen this and firmly rejected it. For a time, it was widely reported that the attitudes of both sides were firm and that the matter would come to a standstill. However, in less than two days, as a result of Yin Tong's hasty trip to Shenyang, such a swift solution was achieved. The changes in this are difficult to understand. According to Yin Tong's conversation with others, no conditions were attached to this resumption of traffic. However, based on our observations, the place of negotiation was outside the customs, the people involved included Kan Duo, and the form of the return of railway rights was a direct transfer from the puppet side. Our gradual acceptance station by station and the situation at the time of transfer will inevitably involve contact with the puppet regime. We have anticipated this in our calculations. As for the fact that there are still many puppet organizations in existence after the traffic reaches Shanhaiguan, and we are in a closely intertwined situation, we will feel even more at a loss in dealing with the situation. Has the authorities also given careful consideration to this in advance in order to obtain a comprehensive countermeasure?</p>
<h3>Army Suddenly Ousts Cuban President Forced to Step Down</h3>
<h3>Revolution Achieved Overnight Without Bloodshed Political Reorganization Approved by the US Ambassador</h3>
<p>Havana Cuba's revolution succeeded overnight without bloodshed. President Machado has succumbed to his troops, resigned, and handed over national affairs to a group of military officers led by Air Force Colonel Tabares and Lieutenant Colonel Minier. Machado is actually under house arrest in the presidential palace. This morning, a proposal to reorganize the government was submitted to US Ambassador Welles, who is mediating between the government and the revolutionary factions. (National Report, 12th)</p>
<p>Havana The situation in Cuba is developing rapidly. Currently, the military has presented President Machado with an ultimatum, demanding that he announce his resignation before noon. The president's resignation may soon be realized. Air Force Commander Marles, one of the leaders of the rebel forces, said that the actions of the army, navy, and air force were very smooth and not a single bullet was fired. To prevent unforeseen circumstances, the cannons of the Cabanas Fortress have been repositioned, with the barrels now pointed at the presidential palace. At the same time, the presidential palace guards have actively prepared, and all machine gun positions inside and outside the presidential palace are manned. Army Chief of Staff General Herrera entered the presidential palace this morning and learned that the military had presented President Machado with an ultimatum, asking him to resign. It is said that this will avoid the threat of US intervention and is also the price of domestic political peace in Cuba. It is now known that after the First Guard Battalion defected, President Machado rushed to the Columbia Barracks near Havana, where he met with representatives of the rebel army. They immediately demanded that the president resign. Currently, Secretary of State Dr. Ferrara is consulting with the leaders of the rebel party on everything, as the president has asked the revolutionary army for ample time to consider announcing his resignation through legal procedures. (Reuters Report, 12th)</p>
<p>The Course of the Army's Uprising According to the army spokesman, the uprising began yesterday morning when several junior officers at the Cabanas Fortress led their troops in an initial revolt. Several senior officers, seeing the danger of the situation, declared that they also wanted to join the revolutionary movement and cautioned them to strictly maintain order. Within a few hours, the Cabanas Fortress and the garrisons in two locations in the city had completely betrayed the Machado government. Other troops, considering that suppressing the rebellion would lead to destructive battles, also joined in succession. Finally, the largest Columbia Barracks in the country also joined, and the military's morale was unified. Machado knew that the situation was irreversible and expressed his submission.</p>
<p>Announcing National Peace and Stability Around midnight, the military sent people to take over the radio station and announced to the people that Machado had abdicated an hour ago, urging the people to live in peace and not be alarmed, to abide by order, and that the military would eliminate violence, prevent chaos, and protect them. After this announcement, the army spokesman announced the course of the uprising to the journalists. The entire city was peaceful this morning, and the military patrolled closely. The order has been very good so far.</p>
<p>Avoiding US Intervention The leaders currently presiding over the government are not the publicly recognized revolutionary figures. According to the army spokesman, the group led the army in a bloodless revolution to avoid US intervention. If Colonel Tabares and Commander Minier had not responded to the requests of other officers and soldiers and taken charge, Havana would have become a hotbed of terror. (National Report from Havana, 12th) Candidates for Successor President The army spokesman also told journalists that he was certain that the military government was not enough to cope with the situation. The military leaders unanimously agreed that the outgoing president should nominate a civilian as interim president, because according to the constitution, an interim president must be nominated when the president leaves office; otherwise, the secretary of state will take over. However, according to the army spokesman, none of the current revolutionary leaders seemed to be favored by the military.</p>
<p>(National Report from Havana, 12th)</p>
<p>Miami, USA General Menocal, leader of the Cuban opposition party, declared that the military was in favor of Colonel Herrera as Cuba's successor president, and said that Herrera's succession was an excellent choice because Herrera was loved by both the military and civilians of Cuba. General Menocal also said that his return to Cuba was only a matter of time and would likely begin next week. It is not yet known whether Menocal will join the interim presidential cabinet in the future. (Havas Report, 12th)</p>
<p>The Navy is Also Unstable New York has repeatedly received telegrams from Cuba detailing the situation in which President Machado, under attack from all sides, is still reluctant to relinquish power. A New York telegraphic report stated that the Cuban naval headquarters in Benta had joined the drive to oust Machado, and Fort Fulcha had been occupied by the rebels. All the military supplies of the garrison there were taken away. Although Machado will inevitably be driven out soon, he is still unwilling to step down hastily.

<p>The US Government Plans to Revive Cuba</p>
<p>Diversifying Agriculture and Limiting Sugar Production</p>
<p>Restructuring Debt and Reducing Burden</p>
<p>Negotiating Reciprocal Trade Agreements</p>
<p>Hyde Park If the Cuban government can implement fiscal and agricultural reforms to stabilize all industries, then the US President has planned a large-scale aid program. The US President intends to see Cuba diversify its agriculture, planting other crops instead of concentrating on sugarcane. He also wants to see Cuba reduce its public and private debts and restart the rural movement, as reducing the people's taxes and other burdens will greatly benefit the country's economy. If the Cuban government can implement these reforms, the US government will reduce tariffs on Cuban goods, negotiate reciprocal agreements, and help Cuba sell most of its products in the US. The US President believes that if a similar agricultural recovery program to the current one in the US is adopted, tailoring farm income to suit the needs of the country and several foreign markets, it will be greatly beneficial. Therefore, as soon as the Cuban political struggle ends, this plan will be proposed. However, the US President has no intention of forcing Cuba to implement this plan, and it has no connection to the current political turmoil. As for Cuban President Machado, he is willing to wait patiently and strive to avoid intervention. (National Report, 11th)</p>
<h3>Terror in the Presidential Palace Overnight</h3>
<p>Rumors of Seven Military Officers Being Executed</p>
<p>Havana Today, after hearing reports that the troops stationed at the Cabanas Fortress had revolted and would enter the city of Havana, Cuban President Machado immediately transferred a large force of trusted troops from the Columbia Barracks and set up cannons and machine guns to protect the presidential palace. He also personally went to the Columbia Barracks in an armored car. According to his attendants, after arriving at the barracks, Machado reportedly summoned the key figures of the revolutionary movement at the Cabanas Fortress to the Columbia Barracks for questioning. After those officers admitted to signing the petition asking the president to resign, Machado had seven of them executed before returning to the presidential palace. However, the army spokesman later told journalists that this information was inaccurate and that no seven military officers had been executed. As for the extent to which the military was unstable, there were no reports during the middle and late parts of the battle, but the presidential palace was heavily guarded, like a large military camp. According to Mr. Guan, he would not allow the military to be disobedient. (National Report, 11th)</p>
<h3>Congress Approves President's Leave of Absence</h3>
<p>Havana The Cuban events that have attracted the world's attention in the past few days are now showing a rapid end. Today, the Cuban Congress accepted President Machado's leave of absence, which is Machado's last step to peacefully surrender and comply with public opinion. Soon after, Machado will formally announce his resignation. (Reuters Report, 12th)</p>
<h3>Cuban Fugitives Have No Lack of Shelter</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department believes that if Cuban President Machado wants to come to the US, the US can grant him asylum in accordance with custom. Machado can settle in Miami, a place where many Cubans have fled, including many who were exiled by Machado. (Havas Report, 11th)</p>
<h3>Army Chief Will Temporarily Assume Power</h3>
<p>The Liberal Party Proposes a Counter-Proposal to the US</p>
<p>Havana The Liberal Party, President Machado's party, recently certified that members of the Executive Committee of the party have proposed a counter-proposal to the US Ambassador Welles, advocating that Machado hand over power to General Herrera of the Liberal Party (i.e., the Minister of War) as interim administrator, while Machado himself requests a leave of absence from Congress.

<h3>The Strike Wave Continues Unabated</h3>
<p>Bombs Explode on Tram Tracks</p>
<p>The Return-to-Work Order Has Not Been Effective</p>
<p>Havana Of the return-to-work orders issued last night, only a portion of the workers followed them today. Only a few union leaders were determined to return to work, and most workers were not as enthusiastic. Tram workers remained on strike. The police forced those who wanted to return to work to board the trams, attempting to protect them and order them to drive, but eight trams were destroyed by bombs, and many of those who wanted to return to work were injured and stopped. Although many shops were open, few food supplies arrived in the city, and the food shortage remained the same. (National Report from Havana, 11th)</p>

<h3>Ma Jiadu's Cruel and Arbitrary Behavior</h3>
<p>A Stark Contrast Before and After</p>
<p>Machado, the outgoing president of Cuba, was a soldier and businessman. He once led troops against Spain. After the Spanish-American War, he abandoned his position and went into business. Since taking power in 1925, he has been known for his iron fist, not hesitating to kill to maintain his regime. When he first took office, he was able to reduce taxes, maintain order, and promote commerce and industry. But gradually, bribery became rampant, and he became increasingly corrupt. Increasing taxes was not enough, so he resorted to borrowing. On one occasion, he borrowed 30 million, and his close associates and confidants pocketed 2 million in commissions. As a result, the opposition grew stronger, and revolutionary groups assassinated officials. Machado also formed a secret police force to retaliate, killing at least 150 suspected individuals. The political situation became increasingly chaotic, leading important Cuban figures to privately request American intervention. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>American Intervention in Cuban Internal Strife</h3>
<p>Intentions Differ from Japan's Designs on Us</p>
<p>American Concerns over Japanese Activity in South America</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain diplomat, the American president is paying close attention to the internal strife in Cuba. Reports say that the U.S. will advise Cuban President Machado to step down. If the situation becomes serious, U.S. Marines may carry out armed intervention. The U.S.'s intentions are primarily to maintain the Monroe Doctrine and prevent foreign intervention, especially wary of Japanese activities in South America. Japan has been working hard to expand its colonization in recent years and already has considerable influence in Brazil. There are also many Japanese immigrants in Mexico, many of whom are retired military officers. If the situation in Cuba deteriorates, it is feared that the Japanese will seize the opportunity to advance. Therefore, it is imperative to quell the Cuban unrest as soon as possible. Secondly, the U.S. aims to restore order in Cuba quickly and protect American commercial interests there. Even if armed intervention occurs, there is absolutely no ambition for aggression, which differs greatly from Japan's designs on us. (Central News Agency Telegram, 12th)</p>

<h3>India-Japan Trade Negotiations: Japan Played by Britain</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministry Besieged Internally and Externally</p>
<p>Government Representatives to Depart Wednesday</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has been quite anxious recently due to the British government's unclear response as to whether it would unconditionally accept the Simla Agreement after the Japan-India negotiations. Judging from the current situation, the British government seems to want to hold another formal meeting in London to decide on this matter. Furthermore, after the current treaty expires, it is difficult to predict what attitude Britain will take. Not only does it not accept Japan's proposals, but it is also intensifying its policy of resisting Japanese goods. The British Chamber of Commerce in Australia has taken the initiative to petition the government to increase dumping duties on Japanese goods, targeting rubber boots, cotton cloth, and light bulbs for exclusion. The atmosphere in South Africa is also becoming increasingly hostile towards Japanese goods. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is attacked internally by industrialists and played by British diplomacy externally. Foreign Minister Uchida feels very棘手 (棘手 means troublesome, thorny, or difficult to handle). (United Press Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The representatives Japan will send to the Simla Conference have been internally decided as Minister Sawada and Trade Bureau Chief Terao. The two are scheduled to travel to India with civilian representatives on the Hakusan Maru on the 16th. The government will formally decide on the order to dispatch Sawada and Terao as representatives of the Japanese government at a cabinet meeting on the 15th. (United Press Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Two American Women Fight Over Deceased Husband</h3>
<p>▲ A telegram from Sass City on the 11th reports that the American aviator Captain Deitz, who died in an accident while performing aviation stunts at the Guangzhou Aviation School, was buried here today. Unexpectedly, there were two women in mourning and weeping. One was Mrs. Marie, who recently married in Shanghai, and the other was Mrs. Betty, who lives in America. Neither of them seemed to know of the other's existence before. Today, they suddenly met before the coffin. Mrs. Betty claimed that she had not divorced Deitz and demanded to see Mrs. Marie's marriage certificate. Mrs. Marie retorted that no one would carry a marriage certificate to the funeral of her husband. It is unknown how this drama of two American women fighting over a deceased husband will end.</p>

<h3>South Irish Blueshirts Voluntarily Cancel Parade</h3>
<p>Public Peace of Mind Ensured</p>
<p>Anti-Government Parties Collude</p>
<p>O'Duffy Obsessed with Fascism</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Dublin, 12th: The Blueshirts originally planned to hold a parade of 30,000 people on Sunday. The general public was deeply concerned that the group might clash with the Free State Republican Army. The Free State government recently issued an order prohibiting the Blueshirt parade. General O'Duffy, the leader of the group, also voluntarily cancelled the demonstration for the sake of maintaining peace. Public peace of mind has been ensured here.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Dublin, 11th: The people of the Irish Free State are all anxious about the scheduled Sunday parade of the Blueshirts, deeply concerned about the possibility of conflicts. The cabinet held a meeting for three hours today to consider whether to prohibit this parade. After the meeting, it was said that they did not want to issue a statement. It is now known that the Blueshirts will wear uniforms, led by a hundred soldiers of the notorious Kirk Brigade, known from past riots. General O'Duffy has instructed all officers to ensure that the entire team moves in unison during the parade, and that the ranks must not be split without direct orders from the responsible officers. General O'Duffy also firmly stated that the team members will not carry weapons. Cosgrave, the leader of the opposition party in parliament, has denied rumors that he and General O'Duffy have secretly colluded to seize the government by chance, and said, "We oppose violent coups and conspiracies, regardless of where they come from. We hope the government will do the same." Although General O'Duffy has declared his opposition to the current parliamentary system of the Irish Free State, it is heard that secret negotiations are currently underway, and Cosgrave's party may merge with the Blueshirts as a result. The National Guard of General O'Duffy officially adopted the Fascist salute today.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Dublin, 12th: This morning, de Valera issued an order prohibiting the Blueshirts from parading at the scheduled time and location, and that they may not march in a different location within one day before or three days after. However, judging from General O'Duffy's instructions to the officers of the Blueshirts, his determination is very firm. Armored vehicles and special police are now gathering in this city. If necessary, troops will also be called in from Curragh for reinforcement.</p>

<h3>Rome Throngs with Crowds to Welcome the Return of the Aircraft Squadron</h3>
<h3>Nationwide Half-Day Holiday, National Flags Sold Out, Not Even Ancient Caesar's Triumphs Were This Grand</h3>
<h3>Balbo to be Promoted to Air Marshal</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, Rome, 12th: The Italian aircraft squadron departed from the capital of Portugal this morning and flew back to its home country. At 11:37 AM, it flew over the area of Attala near Alrelia in Spain. At 11:50 AM, it flew over Cape Gata. At that time, it encountered headwinds, so it was one hour later than the scheduled time. At 1:12 PM, the aircraft squadron flew over Cape Palos. At 2:40 PM, it flew over the island of Formentera in the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, getting closer to the Italian coast. The people here are eagerly awaiting the arrival of General Balbo. The walls everywhere are covered with posters praising the great achievements of the aircraft squadron and printing photos of each aviator. In the afternoon, all stores and offices were closed for half a day to celebrate. The newspapers were filled with news about the aircraft squadron. Special trains to Ostia (where the aircraft squadron will land on the water) are running every few minutes. Members of the Fascist Party and various organizations are mobilized today and tomorrow to participate in the welcoming ceremony.</p>
<p>▲ National, Rome, 11th: Preparations are currently underway here to welcome Air Minister General Balbo and his brave companions on their successful return to the capital. His flying squadron is expected to arrive in Rome from Portugal around 5 PM on Saturday afternoon. All schools, government offices, and commercial establishments will suspend classes and work from noon on Saturday so that everyone can participate in the grand welcoming ceremony. Tens of thousands of people from all over the country are coming to the capital on special trains to participate in the ceremony, the scale of which is no less than that of an ancient Roman general returning in triumph. All newspapers tonight are filled with articles praising General Balbo and his companions.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Rome, 11th: Prime Minister Mussolini has announced that the entire country will have a half-day holiday tomorrow. Currently, about one million people from all over are rushing to Rome to welcome the Italian flying squadron that has crossed the Atlantic twice. Countless national flags have been sold on the main streets of Rome today, all for welcoming the Italian flying squadron. After the flying squadron circles over the skies of Rome and the Holy City, all the aircraft will land at the mouth of the Tiber River not far from Ostia. On Sunday morning, the airmen will enter the city of Rome and will be summoned by the Italian Emperor at the Quirinal Palace. Then, they will be received by Prime Minister Mussolini, and a medal presentation ceremony will be held. At the same time, General Balbo will be promoted to Air Marshal, which is a newly established official position in Italy, and General Balbo will be the first to hold the position.</p>

<h3>Goering Writes Article to Elaborate His Views</h3>
<p>Laying the Groundwork for Germany to Demand Expansion of its Air Force</p>
<p>▲ National, Essen, Germany, 11th: Today, German Air Minister Goering published a lengthy essay titled "On the Unprecedented Success of the Italian Aircraft Squadron" in the local National Newspaper, praising the efforts of Italian Air Minister Balbo. Goering himself is also an aviation expert, so his views are easily valued. Goering listed three major significances of the completion of this flight: First, this move is sufficient to show that the Italian aviation community is filled with a spirit of transcendence in flight. Second, the great potential hidden in the two types of Italian aircraft, Savoia-Marchetti S.55, including the German-made Askania compass and the powerful Telefunken wireless equipment, is sufficient to indicate what kind of equipment should be used in future aircraft manufacturing. Third, this success is sufficient to indicate that the connection between Europe and the Americas is possible even today. If it can be properly organized, transatlantic aviation can be established immediately. Goering further stated that there is indeed air communication between Europe and the Americas, which is the flight between Europe and South America, which can stop at the Westphalia artificial island in the Atlantic. However, we should then engage in communication between Europe and North America, because this is even more important than South America. Approximately, North American flights still cannot but rely on two artificial islands like Westphalia placed in the middle of the Atlantic, because the results obtained from the experiments of the Westphalian floating island are truly amazing. The route for future North American voyages will probably not deviate from the Azores. It is expected that a North American daily flight line will be established soon. As for the greatest potential dangers along the way, one is heavy fog and the other is ice accumulation on the aircraft. However, there is currently no absolute guarantee against these two matters. Goering also said that the success of the Italian Aviation Minister has encouraged the German aviation community. German aviators should engage in even greater creations. Furthermore, gliding without an engine must also be vigorously encouraged in the future. Both large and small towns should have training in gliding, because this can provide an educational meaning of aviation, because military flight in Germany is still prohibited by treaties. Goering concluded by saying that the success of the Italian flying squadron has reminded Germany of its lack of air defense, which has left it in a situation where it is exposed to the great air forces of the great powers, while it is in a helpless situation.</p>

<h3>France Increases Troops in the Rhineland</h3>
<p>Preventing German Brownshirts from Crossing the Border</p>
<p>New Defense Line Deployed on the Eastern Frontier</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 11th: France, in view of the German Brownshirts insulting customs officials at the international bridge across the Rhine River, has increased its troops in the Rhineland to prevent similar incidents from occurring again. A portion of the troops in Mulhouse have been transferred to defend the borders of Huningue, Kembs, and Chalampé and to protect electrical plants.

<h3>Tense Relations Between Germany and Austria</h3>
<p>German Anti-Austrian Propaganda Has Not Ended</p>
<p>Austrian Soldiers Fire on Germans Again</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Stuttgart, 12th: Relations between Germany and Austria have been tense recently due to various events. Today, an incident occurred that made relations between the two countries even worse. Dr. Mensel, the governor of Wittenberg Province in Germany, accidentally crossed the border, and Austrian soldiers opened fire on him.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Munich, 11th: Although the British and French governments have advised Germany against using radio broadcasts to criticize the Dolfuss government of Austria, Honig, a former Vienna correspondent for a German newspaper who was recently expelled by Austrian authorities, made such a broadcast today, saying that the current political tension in Austria cannot last and will eventually explode. If this is to be avoided, the National Socialist Party should be given the powers it demands. He also said that the Dolfuss government is not a patriotic organization and only has a nominal existence.</p>
<h3>Germany Conquers Unemployment</h3>
<p>1.5 Million People Find Work in Six Months</p>
<p>But the Social and Economic Situation Has Not Improved Significantly</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Berlin, 11th: The Hitler government has declared war on unemployment. The government issues public announcements every day, declaring a complete victory. For example, at the end of January this year, the number of unemployed people in Germany totaled 6,014,000, which was reduced to 4,469,000 by the end of July, a difference of more than 1.5 million people. In addition, more than one million people have found work and are not counted in this number. However, the decline in unemployment in Germany is a seasonal phenomenon, with the most obvious decline occurring in agricultural areas, while the situation is not so significant in industrial areas. For example, 24% of workers in the metallurgical industry are still unemployed, and 76% in the textile industry. In the coal mines in various places, the amount of coal stored by the end of June had reached 11 million tons, so it was impossible to hire new workers. Although the decline in unemployment has been officially statistically declared, giving people a deep impression, the improvement of social and economic conditions has not matched it. The amount of domestic and foreign trade has now decreased, and many industries cannot increase production. Inventory is piling up. The officially statistically claimed employed workers receive abnormally low wages, and in fact, they do not work the full amount of scheduled time each day. This is the result of multiple inspections.</p>
<h3>Nazi Party Members Illegally Enter Swiss Territory</h3>
<p>German Ambassador Apologizes to the Swiss Government</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Bern, Switzerland, 12th: Members of the German National Socialist Party illegally entered Swiss territory near Augst, not far from Basel, to conduct searches. The German authorities believe that this action was an unauthorized action by a lower-level leader of the National Socialist Party, and condemned it as inappropriate. They also said that they have begun a detailed investigation and will punish it severely. The German ambassador to Bern has also apologized to the Swiss government on behalf of the German government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Resident in Paris Assassinated in Brussels</h3>
<p>Suspected to be the Work of the Communist Party</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Brussels, 12th: Mr. Suwa, a Japanese resident of Paris, suddenly went missing after coming to Belgium from France. His body was later found in the Escaut River. The newspapers in Antwerp believe that Suwa's economy was not strained, so it is premature to say that Suwa committed suicide. Some people speculate that Suwa may have been a Japanese political envoy, and that his coming to Belgium was related to the fact that communist party members in the port of Antwerp were sending revolutionary propaganda to various ports in Japan. Based on the above, the newspapers said that Japanese communists probably murdered Suwa because he was an enemy to be eliminated. This hypothesis is now gradually taking shape.</p>
<h3>Experiment to Ascend to the Stratosphere</h3>

<h3>Zhu Jiqing Will Announce the Donations Received</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiqing, the person in charge of the volunteer army, said that although the beginning of the green gauze season is a good opportunity to reorganize and raise the flag again, the situation is completely different. Re-raising the flag without a complete plan would be in vain. Therefore, the recovery of lost territory can only wait for the national strength to be replenished. The people from all walks of life enthusiastically donated money earlier, and the money received was used to purchase military equipment or grain. Now, the activities of our army have temporarily come to a halt. The donations must be sorted out and announced so as to report to the people. After arriving in Beijing, I immediately assigned two colleagues to carry out the sorting. It can be completed within a few days. The total amount of donations received is approximately 330,000 yuan. After the announcement, I will take a break. (Special Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues Order Strictly Prohibiting Torture</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 12th: The system of torture has long been abolished. The current criminal law stipulates especially severe punishments for those who use violence or coercion with the intention of obtaining confessions. For many years, judicial organs at all levels have been faithfully following and completely prohibiting it. However, it is feared that military and police organs in various provinces, and county governments that accept judicial cases, may become complacent over time, or may not completely comply and still use torture. This not only violates human rights but also violates criminal law. It is necessary to reiterate the prohibition order and strictly instruct them. Hereafter, no institutions shall ever use torture again, lest they violate the law. If they dare to violate this, they will be severely punished according to the law if a complaint is made and the facts are verified. This order is intended to be a warning to the cruel.

<h3>Record of the "Sheng An" Steamer Hijacking</h3>
<p>(Dalian) Reuter's learned that the "Sheng An" ship's second officer, Wang Ying (transliteration), had described the hijacking, but made no mention of the pirates' plan to sail the ship to Valparaiso to sell it. One of the pirates, a Swiss named Goziqi, originally stated that his German accomplices and he hoped to sail the "Sheng An" to Valparaiso and sell the ship, along with its cargo of coal and peanut oil. The ringleader, Tao Dian, also admitted to this plan, saying that he had promised the Chinese sailors a portion of the proceeds. However, Wang made no mention of this at all. Therefore, the public believes that the pirates' original intention was to sail the ship to another port. Wang said that at 3:34 AM on July 1st, the "Sheng An" was run aground by the pirates near Xingpu. They abandoned the ship and went ashore. When the tide rose, the ship refloated. He then took the opportunity to start the engine, hoping to sail the ship to a place beyond the reach of the pirates. Unfortunately, the ship ran aground on a reef around 4:00 AM and could not move. An hour later, the police boarded the ship. The pirates killed a total of ten people on the ship, including three Russians. All the bodies were thrown into the sea. He first heard gunshots and went out of his room to see what was happening. He then heard more gunshots and dared not go out. Soon after, a pirate entered his room and said that the captain wanted to see him about something. When he arrived at Captain Wickham's room, he saw a pirate sitting on a chair, saying that there was nothing to do at the moment, but he should obey orders when needed. After he returned to his room, he was shocked to see that the steering room was empty and covered in blood. He did not see the captain or the first mate and his wife, and assumed that they had been killed. Later, [the new captain] ordered him to steer the ship towards Niuzhuang. He was afraid of being poisoned, so he had to obey. At that time, because there were no other Chinese on the ship who could do the job, he was specifically ordered to do it. Around 6:00 PM on June 30th, he was ordered to change course towards Dalian. When passing near the Xixingpu beach in Dalian, he was ordered to stop. Then, all the Chinese on the ship were locked in the sailors' room and the firemen's room. He and a few others were still allowed to move freely. Around 11:00 PM that night, the pirates called for nearby sampans to take them ashore, but no one responded. Then, they tried to lower a lifeboat from the ship, but failed. Around 1:00 AM on July 1st, the pirates ordered the ship to be driven closer to the shore, causing it to run aground. The pirates then shouted for sampans again and were able to hire them to go ashore. This was around 3:00 AM, according to (Reuter's, the 12th).</p>

<h3>Naval Strength of Japan and the United States</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun says that because of the de facto failure of the international economic conference, the rise of nationalistic reductionism, and the expiration of the London Naval Treaty in two years, countries are eager to build ships within the limits allowed by the treaty in order to maintain favorable conditions for future disarmament conferences. The Manchurian problem, although it has come to an end due to the transfer of the Hoover-Stimson administration that interfered with our country (Japan), at the same time, since Roosevelt's big navy advocate Swanson took office, his traditional naval policy has been to establish a huge naval plan with the greatest effort, threatening Japan, which is the most noteworthy thing in all aspects. Upon reviewing the content of the United States' announcement of naval construction, at that time, the congressional expansion plan was passed, and in accordance with the public works law, thirty-two new ships were built with a total amount of 238 million yuan, and all the capabilities of government and private shipyards were used to urgently complete the holdings of the London and Washington naval treaties. In order to carry out economic development, the United States had to enrich its powerful navy, but this kind of aggressive navy force has the intention of offensive and defensive operations. If this policy is realized, it will inevitably surpass the navies of all countries in the world, and the Pacific Ocean will be greatly affected. The holdings agreed upon by Japan and the United States at the Washington and London conferences are listed below to show the strength of the US Navy.</p>

<h3>Recovered War Zones in Various Counties are Divided into Two Special Districts</h3>
<p>--Each Special District is to Have an Administrative Supervisor-- There are Still Many Twists and Turns Before the Beining Railway Can Open to Traffic</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Regarding the takeover of the various counties in the Pingdongbei, Luan Dong, and Luanxi war zones, the takeover commissioners Tao Shangming and Yin Tong led the various county magistrates last month and gradually took them over. The Japanese troops in Luan Dong have also been withdrawing one after another, but there are still Japanese garrison troops stationed at Shanhaiguan, and there are still many Japanese-puppet military and intelligence agencies there. Therefore, the county seat of Linyu County has not yet been taken over. The county magistrate Yin sent by us is still being held in Qinhuangdao and has not been able to take office. Li Fengshan's puppet army in Qian'an and Li Shoushan's puppet army in Zunhua are now in negotiations and are being reorganized and disbanded separately. Lu Qingchen, the magistrate of Qian'an County, has already gone to Qian'an and is expected to take over today or tomorrow. Guan Enlin, the magistrate of Zunhua County, is also scheduled to take office today, and there should be no problems. As for Xinglong County, only twelve villages are south of the Great Wall, and the rest are north of the Great Wall. The Dushan Governance Bureau is entirely north of the Great Wall. The Japanese have now renamed it Qinglong County. According to a takeover commissioner, because of the Tanggu Agreement, it is impossible to negotiate the recovery of all places north of the Great Wall. It is only a nominal existence, so there is no hope of taking over the county.</p>
<p>Li Jichun's puppet troops were negotiated for reorganization and disbandment in Tangshan by takeover commissioners Xue Zhiheng and Li Zeyi, and a general agreement has been reached. A total of 4,000 people have been reorganized into two detachments, each with 2,000 people. The provincial government has appointed Wang Tiesheng as the commander of the first detachment and Zhao Lei as the commander of the second detachment. They will be stationed in Fengrun and Luan County. Li Jichun will be given the title of Reorganization Committee Chairman. Shi Yousan's puppet troops were negotiated for reorganization in Qin by takeover commissioner Liu Shisun. Yesterday, they were transported from Qinhuangdao to Tangshan and then to Yutian to be reorganized and disbanded. After Li and Shi's troops are reorganized and disbanded, the two security police detachments organized by the province will go to the counties in the war zone to maintain local security.</p>
<p>Regarding all diplomatic and administrative matters after the takeover of the war zone, the situation is special. Huang Fu, chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, plans to designate Luanxi and Pingdongbei as special zones after they are recovered, and set up one administrative supervisory commissioner in each to handle diplomatic and domestic affairs. He immediately telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government to determine the scope of jurisdiction. The Department of Civil Affairs has now designated 22 counties and one governance bureau related to the Pingdongbei and Luanxi war zones and the Tanggu Agreement, naming them the Luanyu Jimmi Special Zone. The first zone is the various counties in Luan Dong and Luanxi, stipulating that Lulong, Qian'an, Funing, Changli, Luan County, Leting, Linyu, Fengrun, Ninghe Ninth County, and the Dushan Governance Bureau, together with the various special public security bureaus, are the areas of jurisdiction, with a total area of more than 68,900 square miles and a population of more than 2,941,500 people. The second zone is the various counties in Pingdongbei, stipulating that Tong County, Sanhe, Baodi, Ji County, Xianghe, Changping, Shunyi, Miyun, Huairou, Pinggu, Zunhua, Xinglong, and Yutian are the areas of jurisdiction, with a total area of more than 53,200 square miles and a population of more than 2,649,400 people. The provincial government's routine meeting passed this yesterday. The supervisory affairs are divided into diplomatic relations, relief, county promotion, county suppression of bandits, village cleansing, and matters ordered by the various departments of the provincial government. It is planned to set up administrative supervisory commissioner offices in the two districts in the near future. The temporary setting period is six months. If it is necessary to extend the term after the expiration, the provincial government will decide at another meeting. It is said that the purpose of setting up supervisory commissioners is because after the war zone is recovered, all order has not been restored. Now it is adjacent to the Japanese and puppets, and diplomatic affairs will naturally be complicated. The county magistrates alone cannot handle it, so special commissioners are added to discuss it. The issue of candidates is to be selected by the provincial government, but those who are not familiar with the situation in Japan cannot be easily appointed. It was previously decided to appoint takeover commissioner Yin Tong as the supervisory commissioner of the Luanyu District and Tao Shangming as the supervisory commissioner of the Jimmi District, but Yin has indicated that he will not accept it. It is planned to transfer Tao Shangming to Luanyu and appoint the current Shanghai Municipal Government Counselor Yin Rugeng to Jimmi. After the takeover is fully completed and the Takeover War Zone Committee is abolished, it will be announced by provincial order.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of traffic on the Pingyu line, the takeover commissioner said that the Beining Railway has now reached Tangshan. The section from Tangshan to Yuguan still has technical problems with traffic, which are still to be discussed with the Japanese. It will be restored in the short term. However, the Japanese are now demanding, based on the Dalian Conference Record, that we directly connect from Beiping to Shenyang, and at the same time, the puppet Fengshan Railway connects directly from Shenyang to Beiping. The section outside the pass is originally the Beining Railway line, which is now forcibly occupied by the puppet state. The Japanese side argues that traffic from Beiping to Shenyang can be handled, but traffic from the puppet Fengshan Railway to Beiping is tantamount to indirectly recognizing the puppet state organization, which is difficult to approve. This is now being negotiated with the Japanese by our committee members Liu Zhengxun and Yin Tong, and will be rejected (August 10th).</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Goes to Lushan</h3>
<p>││Visits Chiang and Wang to Report on Military and Political Affairs in North China││</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Since Yu Xuezhong, chairman of Hebei Province, took office, he has been in a time of critical Sino-Japanese war. However, his handling of the environment has been praised by the central government. Last month, when the Chahar Province issue occurred, Yu suggested at the Beiping Military Branch that peace should be advocated and that the matter should be dealt with promptly. At the Lushan Conference, Chairman Chiang telegraphed Yu to go south, so that he could inquire about the situation in Chahar and discuss ways to resolve the issue. At that time, he was very busy taking over the war zone and reorganizing and disbanding the puppet troops. Yu replied that he would leave as soon as these matters were completed. Now that the Chahar issue has been resolved, the takeover of the war zone has been largely completed, and the reorganization and disbandment of the puppet troops has also been implemented. Yu left Tianjin this morning (9th) on a special train of the Beining Railway with a dozen or so secretaries and attendants, and a battalion of guards, and went to Ping, and then went south on the Pinghan Railway, and then went to Lushan to visit Chiang, and report on all military and political matters in North China. He will stay in Lushan for about two or three days, and plans to go to Nanjing to meet with President Wang and key figures in various departments to report on the recent situation in Hebei Province. Before leaving, Yu said, [After this incident in Hebei Province, large armies have gathered and the people are suffering even more. The atmosphere in Beiping and Tianjin is prosperous, and the bad habits of officials and civilians have not been eradicated. At this time, our strong neighbor has great ambitions and crises are lurking everywhere. It is urgent for officials and civilians to work together to maintain the critical situation. I plan to ask Chiang and Wang for instructions, and then I will reorganize the military and political affairs in North China], and so on. It is said that after Yu left Tianjin, the affairs of the provincial government are being handled by Wei Jian, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the affairs of the First Army are being handled by Chief of Staff Liu Zhonggan, and the affairs of the municipal government are being handled by Counselor Wang Tao (August 9th).</p>
<h3>Tracks on the Pinghan Railway are Flooded</h3>
<p>--The Yellow River Railway Bridge is Submerged, Causing Obstacles to North-South Traffic</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The Pinghan Railway Management Committee received a telegram from the Zhengzhou Office on the 10th, stating that on the 9th of this month, mountain torrents broke out in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the river channel was silted up, and the water was blocked, causing the tracks on both sides to be submerged, with water accumulating to more than a foot. On that day, the first express train going south from Ping was blocked on the north bank and could not run. On the same day, the express train going north from Hankou was also stopped in Zhengzhou. After receiving the telegram, He Jingwu, the chairman of the committee, telegraphed the office to investigate and report in detail. On the 11th, another telegram was received, saying that the railway embankment in Zhan Dian on the north bank of the Yellow River had been washed away by several feet, and the 68th hole of the Yellow River Railway Bridge was also submerged, causing obstacles and blocking north-south traffic. This has now lasted for two days. The Management Committee immediately issued a notice, temporarily selling tickets for northbound passenger and freight trains only to Zhengzhou. At the same time, it sent Wang Jinzhi, the director of the Engineering Department, on a special express train to Zhengzhou, to go to various places to investigate and supervise the construction day and night. During this time of separation, Yu Xuezhong, chairman of Hebei Province, happened to be summoned by Chairman Chiang on the 10th and took a special train south. On the 11th, he was blocked by the river. Because Yu was busy with official business, he got off the train at Zhan Dian, hired a civilian boat to cross the river, took a rickshaw to Zhengzhou, and changed trains to go south. It is estimated that he will arrive in Hankou and then to Xun on the 12th (11th).</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Takes Command of the Gan River</h3>
<p>--Exclusively Responsible for Suppressing Communist Bandits on the Gan River-- Bai Tianmin Promoted to Division Commander for Meritorious Service</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Since the Zhu-Mao pseudo-First Front Army in eastern Jiangxi was defeated in Yihuang and Lean and retreated to the south of Yile, it was blocked by the national army. A part of it fled east to the Fujian border in Jianning, Huahua, Guangze, Tingzhou, and Longyan. Another part moved west from Yongfeng and Lean, trying to break through the Gan River from Jishui to find another way out. The central section of the Gan River below Ji'an is therefore slightly tense. In order to unify military command of the Gan River and eliminate the Red bandits in the central section of the Gan River, Chairman Chiang specially appointed Wei Lihuang as the commander-in-chief of the Gan River Suppression of the Northern Route Army. The divisions of Li Mo'an, Tao Zhiyue, Liu Kan, and Sun Lianzhong, as well as the independent brigades of Tang Yunshan and Bai Tianmin, are all under his command and direction. After receiving the order, Wei came to the province from Lushan on the 2nd, and then went to Xingan to organize the headquarters of the commander-in-chief, and took office first, commanding the above-mentioned troops to attack and suppress the bandits on the east bank of the Gan River, and set a deadline for suppressing the scattered bandits in the border area north of Yongfeng and Lean, and the border area between Xingan and Chongren. He also supervised and urged the counties of Chongxin, Yongrong, and Yi to quickly complete the defense works near the county seat, and the Diaobao at the bridgeheads of the provincial and county roads in the county for stationing.</p>
<p>According to military sources, Bai Tianmin's Independent 32nd Brigade previously fought fiercely against the main force of Zhu Mao with a force of 3,000 in Yihuang for more than 20 days, and the city of Yi was able to be defended unharmed. Bai was promoted to commander of the 82nd Division. Also, the 11th Division has been fighting in Jiangxi for many years, assisting Ganzhou, attacking Huangpi, and achieving outstanding military achievements. It is said that it has also been ordered to expand into two divisions. Also, Tang Yunshan, the commander of the 33rd Independent Brigade, is said to be promoted to division commander for his effective suppression of bandits (August 7th).</p>
<h3>Red Bandits in Northern Fujian Invade Liancheng</h3>
<p>--Fierce Fighting with the Qu and Lu Divisions-- The Pacification Headquarters Ordered Pang's Brigade to Reinforce</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: After the Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi invaded northern Fujian, they fought fiercely with the troops of Liu Heding and Lu Xingbang many times. The fighting in Chong'an, Guangze, Haining, and Jianning has now come to an end. Liu Shi's three brigades, Jiang Yan, Gui Zhenyuan, and Liu Shangzhi, and Zhou Zhiqun's half brigade (Zhou's troops were originally a brigade, but suffered more than half of their casualties in Guangze in combat with bandits and have not yet been replenished), and Nie Jinlong's regiment are guarding the line of Jianyang, Shaowu, and Jiangle, with Jianou and Shunchang as the rear, and will take a defensive position and implement a blockade policy. Blockade area management offices are set up in the front (ie, the three counties of Jian, Shao, and Jiang), with the county magistrate serving as the director, to control the purchase and sale of daily necessities such as salt, sugar, oil, cloth, and medicine, and strictly prevent them from being imported into the bandit area. Refugee camps are set up in the rear to solve the food and accommodation problems for people who have fled from the bandit area. There are now more than 10,000 refugees gathered in Jian and Shun counties, which is quite costly to manage. As for the bandits in Mingxi, Qingliu, Ninghua, and Liancheng, because they attacked Shaxian and Yong'an, they were unable to succeed. They have now withdrawn from Mingxi. The bandits in Qingliu and Ninghua, numbering about 10,000, have changed their course and attacked Gutian Hukou, which is at the junction of Liancheng and Yong'an, in an attempt to succeed. Since August 2nd, they have been fighting fiercely with Lu Xingbang's division stationed in Yong'an and Qu Shounian's division stationed in Liancheng until the 6th, and have not yet stopped. Now the Lu and Qu divisions have jointly formed a solid defense line between Yong'an and Liancheng, so even if the bandits attack with all their strength, it is difficult to break through. However, this time the bandits' operations are personally directed by Peng Dehuai, so the strategy is also very clever. They also divided their troops into one branch to surround the troops of Lu's division in Quanshang Lifang, which is at the junction of Guxi and Qingliu, in an attempt to contain the fighting in Liancheng and Yong'an. People from all walks of life in the county have telegraphed the Pacification Headquarters, requesting that airplanes be sent to bomb them quickly. The Pacification Headquarters has ordered Pang Cheng's brigade of Qu's division, which is stationed near Shuikouwankou in the province, to rush to Liancheng and join forces with the original troops of Qu's division to jointly suppress the bandits. The defense area left behind will be taken over by the newly formed Supplementary Division Situ Fei's brigade. Pang's brigade has now passed Yanping and arrived in Shaxian. As for Cai Tingkai himself, he can also fly from the province to Zhangzhou in the coming days to command the various armies in western Fujian to attack Changting (August 8th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<h3>County Government Order to Clear Arrears in Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The county collects national taxes. In the past, tax collection offices were set up in both Hua and Qi counties to supervise tax collection. There are 194 tu in Hua County and 182 tu in Qi County. However, the rural police in each tu have been unable to clear the arrears in grain tax in recent years, accounting for eight out of ten. According to county-wide statistics, the amount is more than 200,000. The other day, Shu Ruofu, the director of the Department of Finance, came to Songjiang and instructed that the arrears in grain tax for the 19th, 20th, and 21st years should be strictly urged to be paid off, and must be cleared by the end of this month, and must not be delayed. Magistrate Jin specially summoned the rural police of the Hua and Qi tu to the government yesterday and today to instruct them to clear the arrears, and also to collect the rising grain tax from Tuolin, Caoging, Jinshanwei and other places in Punan Binshao, and if they dare to delay, they will be arrested and pursued. After the instruction, it was found that Xu Jinbao, the rural police in Qitu Township, Fengjing District, had accumulated arrears repeatedly, and the amount was quite large. He was immediately instructed to be detained and released after the payment was cleared, as an example.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Severe Drought Has Become a Famine</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, Wuxi has been dry for a long time without rain. Although fortunately the water level in the river channel is still wide, the irrigation ditches have long dried up.</p>
<p>It is difficult to pump water for rescue, and the crops are even more exposed to the scorching sun, and most of them are withered. For example, in the 45th, 16th, and 17th districts, which have mostly mountainous fields, irrigation is especially difficult and will be hopeless. The district chiefs of each district have successively reported disasters to the county and requested relief. What is even worse is that the mulberry fields in various places are exposed to the scorching sun and have no rain. The mulberry leaves have all turned yellow and cannot be picked. Seeing this situation, the villagers are hesitant about the autumn silkworms, so the price of seeds has plummeted to about 70% in a few days. Even the best Tiger brand silkworm seeds, which were sold for 1.23 yuan per sheet a week ago, are now rarely inquired about even if they are priced at 1 yuan per sheet. After 7 o'clock last night, there was a slight thunderstorm in the Qingcheng area of ​​the northern countryside, but it was only one or two inches, and it was still not enough to saturate the fields.</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Request to Stop Winter Grain Tax Increase</h3>
<p>In 1919, the Jiangsu Province increased the price of winter grain tax by two yuan per stone due to the province's financial constraints. After objections from various counties, it was submitted to the Ministry for approval, limiting it to one time only, and no further increases were allowed after the limit was reached. In the 20th and 21st years, the provincial government continued to increase the tax because the finances had not improved slightly and the national disaster was serious and expenditures were insufficient. However, each time it was still stated that it was limited to one year. Now that the collection of field tax for the 22nd year is approaching in an instant, and the grain tax collection in various counties has been changed to the land price tax, it seems impossible to increase the tax again. However, it is heard that the provincial government has another proposal to continue the tax increase. Yesterday, the county party department, the county property office, the county chamber of commerce, the heads of the 17 districts, and local gentry Hua Wenchuan and others jointly presented to the national and provincial governments, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a clear order to stop it and never collect it again, in order to maintain national credibility and alleviate the people's difficulties in Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Long-Distance Telephone Branch Station</h3>
<p>Wuxi is located in the center of Beijing and Shanghai, with developed industry and commerce and a dense population. There was originally one telegraph office, which was established at the end of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty and has been in operation for more than 30 years. Six or seven years ago, due to the development of business, it was promoted to a second-class office. Recently, since the opening of long-distance telephones, various sectors have been happy to use telephones, and the telegraph business has been greatly reduced. The average monthly income is only 700 to 800 yuan. Recently, Zhu Jiahao, Minister of Communications, stipulated that telegraph offices should be divided into five grades: A, B, C, D, and E. Those with an average monthly income of more than 500 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan per year are Grade D, that is, fourth-class offices. Therefore, the Wuxi Telegraph Office has been downgraded to a fourth-class office in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry. Also, the Ministry of Communications believes that long-distance telephones on the Beijing-Shanghai line are well developed, so branch stations are set up in Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou. The county has received an order from the Ministry and has sent personnel to rent a private house in Zhoushanbang north of the railway to set up a public line station. All long-distance lines are connected to the station for distribution. Except for lines that must enter the bureau, which are transferred by the station and still enter the city, other lines, such as the Beijing-Shanghai lines, can be directly connected in the branch station. It is also heard that after the completion of the Beijing-Shanghai highway, poles will be planted and four pairs of telephone lines will be added to facilitate news from Beijing. At present, the Ministry-operated long-distance telephones in various counties on the Beijing-Shanghai line will also plan to connect with the Yili counties.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<h3>Various Organizations Request Exemption from Winter Grain Tax</h3>
<p>Various organizations such as the Wuyi Property Office, the County Chamber of Commerce, the County Farmers' Association, and the First District Office telegraphed Chairman Chiang, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Government yesterday, requesting exemption from the two yuan increase in the winter grain tax. The original telegram stated that Gu, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, had recently presented a request to the Yuan and the Ministry to increase the winter grain tax by two yuan per stone this year. The people were shocked and informed each other, and the wave of opposition was extremely fierce. It was found that the positive and negative taxes for grain transportation in various counties, in accordance with the regulations of 1% land price, have greatly exceeded. In recent years, the silk industry has declined, the countryside has declined, and the economic situation in various places is on the verge of bankruptcy. The old debts of various counties are more than one million in most cases and tens of thousands in the least. This is enough to show that wealth is exhausted and the people are poor. Now, with another additional tax, not only will the people be unbearable, but it is feared that the original amount of tax will be affected. It is reasonable to telegraph and present to you, please consider the people's difficulties and approve the cancellation of the winter grain tax proposal, in order to preserve the lives of all the people, etc.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Zhonghua Road Project</h3>
<p>The construction authorities have decided to fill up the section of the original Grain Transport River from the Foreign Floating Bridge to the Stone Floating Bridge, considering the river to be abandoned and useless, with accumulated garbage, which not only hinders traffic but also affects public health. They decided to fill it last year and construct a road, named Zhonghua Road. Due to financial difficulties, the construction was delayed until this year after the filling last year. Since the start of construction, progress has been quite good. The road surface has been completed up to Yu Lane, and the branch road will reach Tianzhu Street soon. In total, only one-fourth of the entire road remains unbuilt. If construction is accelerated, it should be completed within the month.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<h3>Military Police Sent to Gaoyou to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Liu Zhusheng, the head of the 340th regiment of the 57th Division stationed in Yangzhou, was approached by representatives from Gaoyou County who reported the rampant banditry and the county's weak military force. They requested that troops be stationed in Gaoyou to suppress the bandits. In response, he telephoned the relevant authorities, ordering the battalion commander of his troops stationed in the town to quickly dispatch a machine gun team to Gaoyou overnight to assist in the suppression. It is also reported that Commissioner Ma Hanbo, upon receiving news of the banditry in the county, also ordered Zhu Xinke, the head of the Jiangdu Police Brigade, to lead his team to Gaoyou to assist. Meanwhile, he instructed Miao, a special agent of the police team, to transfer police officers from the first and sixth squads to Shaobo to prevent bandits from the county from fleeing and disturbing Jiangdu.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<h3>Banditry Rampant Along the Yangtze River in Tong, Rugao, Taixing, and Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Recently, banditry has resurfaced in Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, and Jingjiang. Police investigation reveals that the bandits use boats as their lairs, striking when people are unprepared and retreating quickly, making pursuit difficult. In Taixing, three members of the defense corps were killed by bandits, and five rifles and one pistol were stolen. In Jingjiang, the police corps was ambushed by bandits, resulting in the deaths of thirteen officers and the loss of fifty-three firearms. Currently, military police in each county are on temporary alert. The water police are paying special attention to ships anchored or sailing on the river, and are searching for bandit traces in the deep reeds along the riverbank.</p>
<h3>Construction of a Plane Field Along the Shanghai-Ping Line</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation has sent Nie Kaiyi to Nantong to survey the Tangzha airfield for the purpose of aircraft landing on the Shanghai-Ping line. Construction is currently underway, and wireless radio engineer Pan Zhongzhen has been sent to Nantong to build a wireless radio station.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<h3>The Truth About the Drowning of a Westerner in Zhapu</h3>
<p>A few days ago, a Westerner drowned while swimming in the Zhapu refuge area during high tide. Initial reports identified the person as British, then as a young British woman. Rumors also spread about a reward of 500 gold pieces for recovering the body. However, none of this is true. The person who drowned was actually Russian, a long-time resident of Zhapu. The body was found on Longwang Beach. Neighbors have collected some money to bury the body in a secluded spot on the beach.</p>
<h3>Yixing</h3>
<h3>County Magistrate Wu Orders All Districts to Exert Efforts to Catch Locusts</h3>
<p>Wu Jianong, the county magistrate of this county, sent a telegram to the district chiefs on the 10th, stating that locusts and their nymphs have been discovered in the county. The government has repeatedly issued simplified methods for prevention and elimination, ordering the areas along the lake to eliminate them within a specified time to prevent future problems. Now, the Second District Administrative Inspector's Office has ordered Yue, an instructor, to come to Yixing to inspect and guide the effort. Therefore, all district chiefs are urged to earnestly supervise their subordinates to exert efforts in searching and catching locusts, and to properly coordinate with Committee Member Yue when he arrives, without any negligence.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<h3>The Shanghai Five Aircraft Are Fully Assembled</h3>
<p>The Central Aviation School has completed the assembly of the five Shanghai aircraft (Shanghai Merchant, Shanghai Worker, Shanghai Teacher, Ningbo, and Shanghai Second), which were funded by donations from the five public groups of Shanghai to the government. The planes, which are good fighter planes ordered from Curtiss in the United States, have been assembled at the school's factory since the beginning of last month. Two aircraft have now been assembled, and the remaining three are being rushed for completion. They can be completed today (12th). As soon as the naming ceremony is held, they will be formed into a fighter squadron. Also, because the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory donated an aircraft that was damaged by the seller before delivery, they came to Hangzhou to seek assistance in negotiating with Jardine Matheson to exchange for a new aircraft. Yesterday, the factory sent factory director Wang Chengfu to Shanghai to contact the Tianchu Factory, inspect the damaged aircraft, and assist in all negotiations.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<h3>Bandits Rob Xu Jia Da Jian in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>After the robbery of Yilin Town in this county by bandits, the banditry has become rampant, and rumors are spreading, causing widespread panic. Most of the police forces are concentrated near Majia Dang to suppress the bandits. Unexpectedly, Xujia Dajian in the east of the county, known for its wealth, was suddenly attacked yesterday afternoon at about 2 p.m. by more than a hundred bandits, all dressed in white student uniforms and armed with firearms. They broke into the homes of Xu Guoneng and other business owners in Dajian, searching and confiscating all self-defense firearms, as well as clothes and silver dollars. Xu Yu was kidnapped by the bandits. The neighboring towns of Huayuantou and Zhanggou are extremely panicked.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Sino-American Joint Flight</h3>
<p>Trial Flight Between Shanghai and Manila Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>To expedite Sino-American transportation, the China National Aviation Corporation is planning to establish a Sino-American air route via the Philippines. However, due to the long distance, the route cannot be realized in three or four years. Nevertheless, the company is preparing with the most courageous and determined spirit. The initial plan is to open an air route between Shanghai and Manila, with a trial flight scheduled for tomorrow morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Planned Route to the United States</h3>
<p>The Sino-American air route currently planned by the China National Aviation Corporation will run from Shanghai via Hong Kong to Manila, then across the Pacific Ocean via Honolulu to San Francisco, North America. However, the distance between America and the Philippines is too long. Although Honolulu can be used as a stopover, it requires excellent aircraft and experienced aviation personnel. Therefore, the project faces considerable difficulties. According to Mr. Bixby, a Western director of the China National Aviation Corporation, the completion of the route will take three to four years.</p>
<h3>Establishing Shanghai-Philippines Route First</h3>
<p>To prepare for the joint operation of the Sino-American air route, the company has decided to first establish a preliminary air route between Shanghai and the Philippines. According to Bixby's statement to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, the route from Shanghai to Hong Kong is 900 miles, and from Hong Kong to Manila is 750 miles, totaling 1,650 miles. If the Sikorsky aircraft, which the company plans to test fly tomorrow, is used for this route, it would take 16 hours and 30 minutes to reach, excluding stopovers, as the aircraft can fly 100 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>First Trial Flight Tomorrow</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation director Bixby originally planned to lead American pilots Grollochu and Enmai on a trial flight yesterday morning using a Sikorsky amphibious aircraft. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the flight has been rescheduled for tomorrow (Monday) at 5 a.m., departing from Longhua Airport with the same two American pilots. A brief stopover is planned in Fuzhou to refuel before flying directly to Hong Kong. The estimated arrival time in Hong Kong is around 3 p.m. The aircraft is scheduled to stay in Hong Kong for one day and then continue to the Philippines, arriving in Manila around noon on the 15th. It is reported that there will be no post office mail on tomorrow's departure, only a few private letters.</p>
<h3>New Aircraft Takes Off</h3>
<p>The Sikorsky aircraft for tomorrow morning's trial flight is a new aircraft purchased by the company a month ago. It has two 500-horsepower engines, providing a combined thrust of 1,000 horsepower. The aircraft is of the same type as the aircraft damaged by former Minister of Finance Song Ziwen. The company has now purchased two such aircraft, one of which was previously used for the Shanghai-Guangdong trial flight, with a speed of 100 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Foreign Press Reports on the Flight</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that the China National Aviation Corporation's twin-engine Sikorsky aircraft's exploration of the air route between Hong Kong and Manila, originally scheduled to depart from Longhua Airport this morning (13th), was postponed last night to Monday (14th) at 5 a.m. When asked about the reason for the postponement, Vice President Bixby of Pacific American Airlines stated that it was because tomorrow is a Sunday holiday in Hong Kong, so the departure was postponed to Monday. According to the current plan, the Shanghai-Hong Kong route, using China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong line, is expected to open around September. The Hong Kong-Manila route will be developed by Pacific American Airlines, and the Manila-United States route will be developed by United American Airlines, which holds shares in China National Aviation Corporation. It is expected to be realized in about two years. Therefore, this exploration of the route is being led by Bixby. After departing from Shanghai, the aircraft will pass through Fuzhou, Shantou, Guangzhou, and then to Hong Kong. The next day, it will depart from Hong Kong, fly over the Dongsha Islands, and then to Labrado in the Philippines to refuel before continuing to Cavite Naval Air Station near Manila. After staying for a few days, it will fly back to Shanghai from Cavite.</p>
<h3>Li Jingcong Discusses Developing the Northwest Air Route</h3>
<p>Achieving Considerable Success in Politics and Economics</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Li Jingcong, manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, told reporters that the trial flight to the Lanzhou-Qinghai branch line, originally scheduled for the 15th, has been postponed due to circumstances, but it must be carried out within this month. He also needs to inspect each station in Xinjiang Province, so this trip will take about two weeks. Li also mentioned that the company has been operating for more than three years, and the initial capital of 3 million yuan has been gradually exhausted. Therefore, the company previously submitted a request to the ministry to add approximately 2 million yuan in capital, which has not yet been approved. As a result, the Guangdong-Hankou line and the Sino-German joint transportation, among other projects, cannot be started immediately. The Ministry of Transportation is determined to develop aviation, and the company's operations over the past three years have gained considerable experience in civil aviation and have achieved considerable success in developing the Northwest region in both politics and economics. Since the establishment of the company, the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu have benefited from convenient transportation and rapid communication, so although political changes have occurred in the past, they can now be prevented. Although the Xinjiang route was opened early and received enthusiastic support, the company's radio station installation was met with suspicion and obstruction, making navigation difficult. However, after the Xinjiang incident, the government was able to send officials to appease the region in the fastest possible way, preventing the incident from escalating. These are all political achievements. The economic circulation and development in various regions need not be mentioned. The development of the Northwest air route is indeed a significant milestone in the history of transportation in China, and the Ministry of Transportation regards the development of the Northwest air route as an important undertaking.</p>
<h3>Xi Demao Denies US Cotton Sales to Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Bank sources indicate that the US cotton and wheat have not yet been shipped from the US to China. According to Xi Demao, General Manager of the Central Bank, when the Sino-American agreement was signed, both parties agreed that the US would be notified to begin shipping the cotton and wheat only after China had sold the items. This cotton and wheat was purchased on credit for rural relief and should be sold to state-owned factories first. Xi Demao had not heard of any reports of the cotton and wheat being resold to Japanese merchants. The matter is being handled by the Central Bank's office, which has been established and assigned to Xi Demao. Xi Demao stated that he can take responsibility for what he has said. The office is currently being actively prepared, and the date of its establishment depends on Director-General Kong.</p>
<h3>Joint Shanghai-Beiping Rail Service Scheduled to Begin on National Day</h3>
<p>Initial Service: One Passenger Train Each Way Per Day</p>
<p>Additional Freight Cars and Shanghai-Tongguan Passenger-Freight Service</p>
<p>Second-Class Sleeping Cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Begin Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo-Hangzhou Railway Administrations, acting on orders, are preparing for the joint Shanghai-Beiping rail service, scheduled to begin on this year's National Day. A conference on joint transport methods will be held in Beijing on September 1st. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Scheduled Opening</h3>
<p>The Capital Ferry Project is nearing completion, and the Changjiang ferry is also fully equipped. Trial runs will be conducted once the project is completed, and the service is scheduled to begin on National Day, October 10th. The ferry methods have been drafted by the preparatory committee and will be implemented by order of the Ministry of Railways. As for the joint Shanghai-Beiping rail service, the Beijing-Ningbo, Tianjin-Pukou, and Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administrations have agreed that the service will officially begin on National Day.</p>
<h3>Departure Times</h3>
<p>The joint Shanghai-Beiping passenger train is scheduled to run once each way per day. The departure times have been drafted. On the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the train will depart from Nanjing at 5:25 p.m. and arrive in Shanghai at 11:55 p.m. The train will depart from Shanghai at 12:00 a.m. and arrive in Nanjing at 7:45 a.m. As for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the train will arrive in Pukou at 3:25 p.m. The ferry will take two hours. However, the departure time from Shanghai West, which is currently the Beijing-Shanghai night express at 11:30 p.m., still needs to be determined after consultation.</p>
<h3>Joint Railway Conference</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, with the joint Shanghai-Beiping rail service imminent, has scheduled a joint conference in the capital on September 1st, inviting the Beijing-Ningbo, Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Shanghai, and Longhai Railway Administrations to discuss and decide on matters such as train schedules and fares. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo-Hangzhou Railway Administrations have assigned Zheng Baozhao, Director of Transportation, and Deputy Director Yuan to attend the conference in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Joint Transport Plan</h3>
<p>A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter met with Yuan, Deputy Director of Transportation for the two railways, who stated that the joint Shanghai-Beiping service will begin once the Capital Ferry is completed. Initially, the service will operate once each way between Shanghai and Beiping, consisting of first, second, and third class passenger cars. According to the planned schedule, there will be one passenger train and one freight train each way between Shanghai and Beiping, running from Shanghai to Beiping, through the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and the Beijing-Ningbo Railway. There will also be one passenger train and one freight train each way between Shanghai and Tongguan, running from Shanghai to Tongguan, through the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and the Longhai Railway. The implementation of the planned schedule will depend on the business needs after the Shanghai-Beiping passenger and freight service is in operation.</p>
<h3>Second-Class Sleeping Cars</h3>
<p>As for second-class sleeping cars, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and other lines have already implemented them. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway has only had first-class sleeping cars. Now, the two railway administrations are preparing second-class sleeping cars, which are being renovated at the locomotive factory and will be completed soon. They will be put into operation on October 10th, the day the joint Shanghai-Beiping rail service begins, to benefit passengers (above from Xin Sheng News Agency).</p>
<h3>Ferry Fares</h3>
<p>Passenger ferry fares are calculated based on the distance across the river at Xiaguan (calculated as 10 li): first class is 34 cents, second class is 22 cents, and third class is 17 cents. Freight charges are 1.50 yuan per ton upstream (from Nanjing to Pukou) and 2 yuan per ton downstream (from Pukou to Nanjing), but the maximum is 1,200 tons. It is understood that the railway authorities, due to objections from merchants to this method, believe that the same cargo crossing the river should not be charged different rates for upstream and downstream, which affects the future development of direct freight transportation between the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. To reduce the burden on merchants, the Railway Ministry has instructed the ferry preparatory committee to reduce freight charges for crossing the river as much as possible within the possible range, and to eliminate the distinction between upstream and downstream, and to charge a unified rate (Xin Sheng News Agency).</p>
<h3>Land Bureau and Finance Bureau Announce Land Value Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The Land Bureau and Finance Bureau Issue Detailed Rules for Land Value Tax Collection (Continued)</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and Land Bureau jointly announced yesterday: "Regarding the joint announcement, the temporary land value tax collection in this city, all the collection regulations have been submitted by the Municipal Government to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation.

After the land is cleared, surveyed, and reissued with certificates, the taxpayer may take the field tax receipt to the Land Bureau for verification, have it stamped with an approval to deduct the land value tax, and indicate the household name and number recorded in the land value tax register, and deduct the amount from the tax collection agency designated by the Finance Bureau.

The proceeds shall be used to offset the arrears and annual interest, and the remaining amount shall be returned to the taxpayer in arrears.

<h3>Public Statement by the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Trade Association on Advocating for National Railways</h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: Yesterday, the Shanghai Copper, Iron, and Machinery Trade Association received a letter from the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group," questioning why, in this time of national crisis, it was allowing the Pei Chang and Shun Tai iron businesses to privately sell Japanese iron. The wording was very stern. The Association responded that Pei Chang and other iron businesses belong to the Iron Trade Association, not the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Trade Association. To ensure that all sectors of society thoroughly understand the situation, the Association issued the following statement:</p>
<p>This Association is composed of machinery factories and foundries in Shanghai; iron merchants are not included. We have always been enthusiastic about the anti-Japanese cause. Since the January 28th Incident, we have been working to protect national products. Pig iron, which is essential for our industry, is of utmost importance. Originally, there were several state-owned pig iron plants such as Hanyang, but due to various reasons over the years, they gradually ceased operations. Currently, only the Liuhegou plant remains, producing two thousand several hundred tons per month, which is sufficient for the needs of our industry. However, Japanese iron has implemented a dumping policy, and treacherous merchants have risen up to manipulate the market, endangering the only remaining national iron plant.</p>
<p>The members of our Association recognize that machinery is the mother of industry, and iron is the foundation of machinery. However, because no one has promoted this through newspapers, the people of the country are largely unaware of it, which is deeply regrettable. Our Association previously took steps to investigate and seal up Japanese iron. A total of over ninety firms in the industry did not have any Japanese iron in stock at the time. Nine firms complied with the regulations and stored their existing stock. Eleven firms complied with the investigation but had already used up their stock by the time of storage. Five firms complied with the investigation but opposed the storage. As for those who refused to cooperate with the investigation, there were two: Huanqiu and Mingjiang.</p>
<p>Currently, our Association has also organized the China Machinery United Company, which has signed a contract with Liuhegou to sell their products, on the one hand protecting the lifeline of national iron, and on the other hand freeing the industry from being manipulated by others. The members of our Association believe that this is the most practical way to save the country. Therefore, we have all bravely raised funds to carry out this endeavor. However, the task is enormous and difficult. We hope that the people of the country will rise up and help us to succeed, which will be a blessing not only for our industry but also for the nation.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke to Return to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>It is reported that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, previously went to Qingdao with Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to escape the summer heat. According to sources close to Sun, Sun has arranged for his mother to take the Puan ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the 17th to return to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive on the 18th and will then proceed to Nanjing to attend to matters.</p>

<p>Government Funds Repatriation of Stranded Japanese-Chinese Refugees</p>
<h3>121 Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The Chinese expatriates stranded in Japan due to unemployment will, after the Central Government allocates funds, will be processed by the Embassy in Japan, to handle the repatriation to China. The first batch of the expatriates are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Stranded in a Foreign Land</h3>
<p>Among the Chinese expatriates in Japan who are engaged in commerce, the catering and kimono businesses are the most common. In the labor sector, hairdressing and manual labor are the main occupations. Most of them are from Fujian, Zhejiang, and northern Jiangsu. After the January 28th Incident, Chinese workers in Japan were dismissed by Japanese merchants. Those with funds have mostly returned to China. Those without funds, numbering three to four hundred, are stranded in a foreign land and unable to return home. These Chinese expatriates are subjected to expulsion by Japanese police and rush to the Chinese consulates in Japan, begging for repatriation so that they may return to their homeland and seek a new livelihood.</p>
<h3>Embassy Rescue</h3>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Japan, on behalf of these unemployed Chinese expatriates, has been seeking ways to provide relief and repatriation. It first telegraphed the Central Government, requesting the Ministry of Communications to order the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send a ship to Japan, going to Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagasaki to transport them to Shanghai. The Ministry of Communications ordered China Merchants to dispatch a ship. Subsequently, because the company did not have a suitable ship, the Ministry telegraphed to seek other options. After discussions at the Central Government level, the decision was changed to allocate funds to be remitted to Japan, with the embassies and consulates purchasing ship tickets and sending them back to Shanghai, which is more convenient.</p>
<h3>Gathering in Nagasaki</h3>
<p>The Central Government remitted 7,000 yuan last month to Japan for the repatriation of these expatriates, entrusting the embassy to handle it. However, the stranded expatriates are scattered throughout Japan, in Yokohama, Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and Nagoya. Therefore, the embassy notified the consulates in various locations to transfer all the Chinese expatriates scattered in various places to Nagasaki so that they could board ships to return home. The first batch has been assembled and has all arrived in Nagasaki. At the same time, ship tickets were purchased from the British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire, and boarding began yesterday afternoon in Nagasaki.</p>
<h3>Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The first batch of repatriated Chinese expatriates, totaling one hundred and twenty-one, mostly from Fujian and Wenzhou, Zhejiang, boarded the Butterfield &amp; Swire ship "Empress of Asia" in Nagasaki yesterday to come to Shanghai. The company received a telegram from Japan yesterday stating that the "Empress of Asia" is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:30 tomorrow morning. The ship will dock at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong, where all the Chinese expatriates will disembark. The Public Security Bureau will send senior police officers to provide assistance. The second batch will be gathered and then sent back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Expelled Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>More than ten Chinese laborers, including Liao Chengwen, Huo Changwu, Wang Fengbiao, Yang Jiabin, Lin Yaoyou, and Weng Zaiqiu, who went to Japan from Shanghai and were originally working in the Sendagicho area of Fukada Ward in Tokyo, have been prohibited from entering Japan by the Japanese authorities and expelled from Japan. They were escorted back to Shanghai on a Japanese ship yesterday. They were ordered to pay for their travel expenses. If they did not have the funds, their luggage was confiscated as collateral.</p>
<h3>Japan Again Uses Pretext of Protecting Nationals to Dispatch Warships to Xiamen</h3>
<p>Japanese Police to Depart Today</p>
<p>Japanese Warships on Standby</p>
<p>The Communists have invaded Liancheng and are engaged in bloody battles with the 19th Route Army. Residents in the Longyan and Zhangzhou areas are fleeing to Xiamen. However, because there are already over four hundred Japanese nationals in Xiamen, they are again using the pretext of unrest to request that their consul send troops to Xiamen to protect them. The Japanese Consul in Xiamen telegraphed to Shanghai, requesting the Commander of the Shanghai Consulate Police, Nimi Kyusango, to dispatch a unit of mobile police to Xiamen to protect Japanese nationals. Yesterday, Nimi appointed Police Chief Akahoshi to lead nine mobile police officers, who will depart for Xiamen on the Taikoo Shandong ship at 9 a.m. today.</p>
<p>Commander Minei of the Japanese Third Fleet in Shanghai has received a telegram from the Naval Ministry stating that the nationals in Xiamen urgently need protection. In addition to ordering the Makung fleet to dispatch, he has also ordered two Japanese warships in Shanghai to prepare to set sail for Xiamen on standby to protect nationals.</p>
<h3>US Flagship Houston Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Preparing to Welcome New Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>The flagship of the United States Asiatic Fleet, the USS Houston, arrived in the Huangpu River at 4:20 a.m. yesterday (the 11th) from North China, preparing to welcome the new Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Upham. Admiral Upham and his wife are coming to Shanghai on the President Jackson and are expected to arrive on Tuesday morning next week. Mrs. Upham has been staying in Japan for several weeks, and the American expatriates and Japanese government officials have treated her very well. The outgoing Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Yarnell, is scheduled to hold a formal handover ceremony on the flagship USS Houston on Friday next week. After Admiral Upham takes office, the USS Houston will return to North China around the 20th.</p>
<h3>American Journalism Professor and Students Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Missouri Alumni Association Preparing to Welcome</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Professor Allard of the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, leading a group of journalism students, is traveling around the world to observe journalism in various places and practice international communications. They will arrive in Shanghai tonight (the 12th) or tomorrow morning on the Cateric ship from Hong Kong. According to a telegram from Hong Kong, Professor Allard's group, in addition to his wife and son, consists of about ten male and female students. They arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday, took a short trip for a day, and then departed for Shanghai on Thursday. They plan to stay in Shanghai for a week, visiting journalists, touring newspaper offices, discussing Far Eastern issues, and inspecting local conditions. They will then visit Nanjing and other places for about two weeks of sightseeing in China before going to Japan. The Missouri Alumni Association in Shanghai is currently preparing to welcome them.</p>
<h3>Sun Tonggang to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Replied to Mayor Wu by Telegram</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang, a young Chinese aviator who studied in Germany, returned to Jinan from Nanjing to visit his family. He received repeated telegrams from Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai, welcoming him to come to Shanghai to demonstrate his aviation skills, thereby increasing the Shanghai citizens' interest in aviation and national salvation, and to admire his demeanor. Sun initially had no intention of coming to Shanghai, so he only replied with a thank-you telegram, saying nothing else. Now, because he plans to make a long-distance flight around the country, he telegraphed Mayor Wu yesterday, saying that he could come to Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>New Telecommunications Plan of the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications borrowed £50,000 from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to build a radio station in Zhenru and ordered telecommunications equipment from the British Marconi Company. The equipment has arrived in Shanghai. The Sino-British telecommunications date is scheduled for a preliminary report on National Day and a formal report at the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Use of New Standard Weights and Measures by Deadline</h3>
<p>Yesterday Ordered All Affiliated Agencies in Shanghai to Comply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance ordered all agencies under its jurisdiction in Shanghai to use a new measurement system starting February 1st of next year, setting a preparatory implementation period from August 1st to January 31st of next year.</p>
<p>The full text of the order is as follows:</p>
<p>For compliance purposes, it has been repeatedly reported by the Ministry of Industry regarding the change to the new system of weights and measures. If government agencies do not take the lead in promoting this new system, the people will remain skeptical. Please forward this order to all agencies under your jurisdiction, and ask them to implement it across the board. The reasons are quite valid and should be prepared within a limited time, so as to facilitate the promotion and return to uniformity. The preparatory period for all agencies under our ministry is set at six months, from August 1st of this year until January 31st of the 23rd year of the Republic. All agencies should expedite the preparation of matters such as the conversion to the new system, the calculation of conversion rates, and other matters. On February 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic, the new system of weights and measures shall be implemented across the board without delay. This order is hereby issued to all agencies under our jurisdiction for compliance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Requests Reduction in the Fixed Tax on Shaoxing Wine</h3>
<p>Even if the Tax Rate is Increased Compared to the Old Rate</p>
<p>It Should Not Be Too Different</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, according to a letter from the Shaoxing Wine Industry Association, the tax rate list for local yellow wine previously listed the tax on Shaoxing wine from Jiangsu Province at two yuan, imitation Shaoxing and local white spirit at one yuan and forty cents, and local yellow wine at eighty cents, all collected per hundred catties (市秤). The rice used to make wine in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, is purchased from Jiangsu Province. Last year, the price of rice was six yuan per stone. Two stones of rough rice can be used to make one vat of wine, yielding about six hundred catties of wine. Therefore, the cost of making one hundred catties of wine requires two yuan plus decoration, containers, wages, taxes, and transportation costs. The wholesale market price in Shanghai will inevitably be slightly higher.</p>
<p>Last year, the public sale tax rate was 20% of the value, with a tax of 56 cents per hundred catties. The tax rate now proposed is two to three times higher than the public sale tax rate of last year, which is difficult to bear. The association directly submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, asking it to verify and reduce the tax. However, the provincial bureau recently issued an instruction, stating that the current tax rate is based on the compromise of the cases collected in each county during the previous public sale, and there is no increase in the burden on merchants. It is discovered that last year's public sale price in this province was five jiao and six fen per dan, while this year's new regulations require more than two yuan per dan (市斤), which is more than double the previous year. The provincial approval said that there was no increase in the burden. This is the first incomprehensible point.</p>
<p>Last year, various firms reported and paid taxes to the collection branch, all with certificates issued by the Ministry of Finance as proof. The Shanghai Collection Branch is appointed by the Provincial Bureau. How can the Provincial Bureau approve orders saying there are no records to be audited? Even if it is true, it is a private reduction. This is the second incomprehensible point.</p>
<p>Last year, the cost of Shaoxing wine was two yuan and nine jiao per dan. At 20% of the value, the tax was five jiao and six fen, which was still appropriate. The market price per dan refers specifically to the weight of the pure wine. As for mud caps, decorations, wine jars, transportation costs, production taxes, and public sale fees, these should not be added to the cost of Shaoxing wine itself. However, the provincial approval originally set the price at ten yuan per hundred catties, with a public sale tax of two yuan, which is vastly different from the market price. This is the third incomprehensible point.</p>
<p>The provincial approval also stated that the tobacco and alcohol tax affairs have been deeply rooted and have been criticized for a long time, as seen in the documents, which shows that there is a need for reform, etc. If the accumulated writings are to be removed, only the previous methods should be changed appropriately. How can doubling the tax rate and heavily oppressing merchants be considered a reason for reform? This is the fourth incomprehensible point.</p>
<p>We hereby request that you forward this letter for relief. According to recent reports, the Ministry has approved the petition of the Liang white spirit industry, stating that the old regulations for public sale were based on value, and the market price fluctuated frequently, making it easy to abuse. Therefore, it has been changed to a fixed tax based on volume, specifically for the convenience of merchants and not comparable to a tax increase, etc.</p>
<p>This means that the focus of the new regulations is on standardization, not tax increases, which the Ministry has already announced. Since the old collection rate was 56 cents per hundred catties, and it has been changed to a tax of two yuan, no matter how it is said, the tax increase is obvious, and the increase is very large. We propose that your office follow the purpose of facilitating merchants and stipulate a moderate fixed tax for Shaoxing wine. Even if the fee rate is increased compared to the old rate, it should not be too different, so as to make the matter fair and reasonable. We hope that you will review and instruct us to comply, which will be beneficial to the public. Sincerely, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>The Delegation of the National Goods Factory Association Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association, because various manufacturers in our country generally have weak capital and find it difficult to compete with foreign merchants' dumping, and in order to seek relief, specifically drafted measures to encourage national goods. They dispatched standing committee members Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Zilian, Ma Jisheng, and executive committee member Jiang Zhonghe, a group of four, to Beijing on the 6th of this month via the overnight train to Beijing-Shanghai. They presented their request to the Ministry of Industry at 10:00 a.m. on the 9th. Minister Chen Gongbo was on official business in Qingdao, so Vice Minister Guo Chuntao received them. In addition to submitting the petition and various measures to encourage national goods and develop production, the delegation verbally stated everything. Vice Minister Guo expressed his strong approval of the National Goods Association's proposed measures to encourage national goods and promised to forward them to Minister Chen when he returned to Beijing for review and approval. The delegation was satisfied and returned to Shanghai by train the night before yesterday and arrived yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Performance of the Central Mint's New Coins</h3>

<h3>Haining Salt Merchants Pass Through Shanghai En Route to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>Because the Huangwan Weighing and Release Bureau Increased Salt Taxes</p>
<p>Haining Salt Merchants in Zhejiang Province are protesting the increased salt taxes by the Huangwan Weighing and Release Bureau, which is affiliated with the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Inspection Office. They have sent representatives to Beijing to petition. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Newly Increased Salt Taxes</h3>
<p>The Huangwan, Liliqiao, and other three areas of Haining are the center of salt production in the county. The annual value of salt production is about one million yuan. Traditionally, a tax of one yuan was levied on each dan of salt, while edible salt was sold tax-free. This has been the case for a long time. However, this year, the Huangwan Weighing and Release Bureau notified the various factories that edible salt sold locally must also be taxed, leading to opposition from various sectors in the area.</p>
<h3>Petitioning in Beijing</h3>
<p>The local salt merchants believe that the rural economy is declining and all aspects of society are appealing. The authorities are ignoring this and are instead trying to increase the burden on merchants, indirectly increasing the suffering of farmers. Yesterday, they sent representatives Zhu Baokang, Wu Jiping, and others, a group of four, to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting: 1) Consider the difficulties of merchants and exempt them from the newly increased salt tax; 2) Salt has been tax-free for a long time, and permission should be granted to sell it tax-free.</p>

<h3>Continuing News on the Labor Dispute at the British American Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>All Departments in the Old Factory Shut Down</p>
<p>The Union Expands its Propaganda</p>
<p>Details of the slowdown strike in the leaf department of the British American Tobacco Factory (old factory) in Pudong have already been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that yesterday afternoon, at the end of work, the foreman of the tin packing department of the old factory informed the workers that they did not need to come to the factory today and that they would return to the factory when the dispute was resolved. The workers believed that they were required to work until Saturday as usual. The factory intended to use the opportunity of the slowdown strike in the old leaf department to reduce working hours in order to save wages, which was unreasonable. Therefore, the entire group asked the foreman to fight for their rights for several hours. The factory finally agreed to work as usual yesterday (i.e., Saturday).</p>
<p>In order to make the workers in various factories understand the truth of this incident, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union convened an emergency propaganda meeting yesterday afternoon. More than one hundred people attended. In addition to the existing propagandists, many people temporarily signed up to join. Fei Keguang, the director of the propaganda section, was elected as chairman and Sun Xiaozhu as the recorder. After the meeting was opened, the chairman reported on the factory's oppression and the various situations of the workers. Then, discussions began, and the following matters were resolved: (1) In accordance with the organization of the Great Strike of 1927, the propagandists will be temporarily organized into twelve teams, with nine people in each team. Each team will have one captain and one deputy captain, and one general captain and one deputy general captain will be elected to lead them. (2) Expand propaganda and, if necessary, send teams to work in various cities. (3) The number of propagandists will never be increased. (4) The propaganda section will organize a secret investigation team to monitor the actions of labor traitors and lackeys. (5) Issue a declaration and post slogans to inform all sectors of society. The meeting adjourned at seven o'clock.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Meeting of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession</h3>
<p>Oppose French Troops Forcibly Occupying the Nine Small Islands</p>
<p>Continue to Request Cancellation of Chinese-Foreign Telephone Call Fees</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession held a standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. Zhu Shengmao, Gong Jingyan, Pan Zhaobang, Dong Kechang, Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Lizhang, Xu Xiuting, Dai Chunfeng, Cheng Zhusun, Du Yuesheng (representing Cheng Zhusun), and others attended. Cheng Zhusun was the chairman, and Shao Bingyuan was the secretary. First, the chairman read out the resolutions of the previous meeting. In addition to those that had been implemented separately, regarding the case of the French Municipal Council increasing the tent tax, various businesses believed that this tax was unjustified and jointly sent a letter to the Association to negotiate for its cancellation. The Association has sent a letter to the Chinese directors, proposing to cancel the tax at the next meeting of the Municipal Council. Also, regarding the case of the French police officer teasing a woman on Rue Cardinal Mercier, after Chairman Du negotiated with the French authorities, the police officer has been legally detained.</p>
<p>After the report was completed, the following proposed matters were discussed: (1) Regarding the report that French warships have secretly occupied China's Nine Small Islands, it was resolved to telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately conduct serious negotiations to achieve the goal of recovery, and also to telegraph the French Ambassador to China, requesting the French government to consider the Sino-French relationship, respect Chinese territory, and return the islands quickly to foster friendship. (2) Regarding the cancellation of the telephone call fee between the Chinese and foreign concessions, it was resolved to send a letter directly to the Shanghai Telephone Company requesting its cancellation. The letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern, the fact that telephone calls between the Chinese and foreign concessions are subject to a call fee not only burdens users but also hinders communication between the Chinese and foreign concessions. After repeated efforts by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has approved and implemented the cancellation of the fee on the Chinese side. Your company should do the same immediately to facilitate users. Residents of the French Concession have requested our association to negotiate this matter. Therefore, we are writing to your company to investigate and handle this matter so as not to arouse public anger." Also, a letter will be sent to the Chinese directors, proposing to the Municipal Council to cancel the fee. (3) Regarding the fact that merchants in Caishi Street use weight scales to trade with foreign merchants, and now the Social Bureau and the police are inspecting weights and measures and do not allow the use of weight scales, a request was made to the authorities to be lenient. It was resolved that, since the law on weights and measures is determined by government regulations, it should be followed uniformly, and the Association cannot handle this matter. As for the fact that various businesses believe that it is difficult to trade with foreign merchants due to customs, they can directly request relief from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry. (4) Regarding the Association's relocation, it was resolved that the houses in Weishui Fang on Pingji Li Road are more suitable. After proper consultation, a temporary meeting will be convened for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Northern Disaster-Affected Schools Present Tripod to Dai Jie</h3>
<p>The United Office of Private Schools Affected by Disaster in Northern Shanghai, because Commander Dai is leaving soon, specially made a stone tripod as a sign of respect, inscribed with the words "National Protector." Cao Youguang and others were selected to present it to the Garrison Command. Commander Dai met them and had a pleasant conversation, personally guiding them to visit the January 28th Memorial Hall and the commemorative stele of donated photographs. Such a caring leader is truly admirable. Another eulogy is listed below:</p>
<p>Respectfully Praising:</p>
<p>The Disaster-Affected Schools United Office, previously held a performance at the Tianchan Stage to raise funds for the Recovery Fund, inviting Mei Lanfang to perform. We are grateful for your generous support to the disaster-affected schools. Your purchase of tickets, assistance, and promotion of education were particularly enthusiastic. We have already sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<p>During the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese invaders ran rampant. You, sir, were not afraid of the border defenses and were a strong anti-Japanese fighter. Knowing that the serpent and wild boar would devour the land, you had long planned your strategy. Fortunately, with high walls and deep trenches, the enemy could not achieve their ambitions. Teaching warfare to avenge our humiliation was to seek ways to kill the enemy. Defending the land and serving the public meant sacrificing ourselves and not leaving. Although our lone army was cut off from support, the enemy's arrogance was suppressed.</p>
<p>After the agreement was reached, you, sir, were stationed in Shanghai for more than a year. The military discipline was strict, and the people were at peace. We hoped that you would long be a protector of the South and a security of the North. Now, you have suddenly received orders to move to Fujian, and we deeply regret that we cannot hold you back. Turning from military administration to civil administration, your promotion is deeply tied to the hearts of the people. Going from Shanghai to the Fujian River, your teachings should diligently seek governance. Now, the flags are pointing far away, and the pear tree remains only after you have left. Looking back, we cannot express our feelings. Therefore, we have carved stone and cast a tripod to commemorate and never forget.</p>
<p>Cao Youguang, Du Chunxun, Shen Kelong, Hu Yibo, and Cheng Zhuchen are specially sent to present them to you, sir. We hope that you will accept and keep them. Our gifts are simple and inadequate to express our respect and courtesy fully. Our loyalty is sincere, and we are deeply attached to you. We hope that you will return to govern Jiangnan again. This is what we silently pray for.</p>
<p>Respectfully Presented to Commander Dai, Commander of the Songhu Garrison.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Liquor Industries Jointly Urge Tax Reform in All Tobacco-Producing Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Liquor Industries Joint Association, in order to vigorously push for amendments to the new tobacco tax regulations, yesterday sent express telegrams to various tobacco industries in tobacco-producing regions across the country, urging them to strive together. The telegram read: Jiangxi Guangfeng, Nanxiong, Ruijin, Duchang, Ruichang, Hubei Guangji, Huguang, Dengzhou, Zhuhu, Anhui Tongcheng, Susong, Huangmei, Henan Xuzhou, Junzhou, Zhejiang Tongxiang, Xinchang, Xiaoshan, chambers of commerce in various counties, forwarded to tobacco trade guilds and tobacco firms for their information. It has been found that the new tobacco tax regulations do not differentiate between grades and levy a national currency tax of four yuan, one jiao, and five fen per 100 jin net weight. Our association has repeatedly submitted reports to the authorities, requesting a graded tax system to ensure fairness, but this has not yet been approved. The second executive meeting resolved yesterday that we should continue to vigorously push for this, and telegraphed tobacco trade guilds and tobacco firms in tobacco-producing regions in various provinces to fight together to achieve our goal and reduce the burden. This was unanimously approved. In addition to sending telegrams, we are sending this express telegram, requesting your association to check and inform tobacco trade guilds and tobacco firms to proceed with efforts to achieve this goal, and please provide us with a detailed reply regarding the situation in your county so that we have guidelines to follow. We will be publicly grateful. Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco Trade Guilds Joint Association, Chairman Chen Liangyu, Executive Committee Members Zhang Suhou, Yu Xunlu, Shen Weiting, Cao Gexian; Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Liquor Trade Guilds Joint Association, Chairman Zhang Dalian, Executive Committee Members Jin Yunjie, Dai Zhuo'an, Jin Jiayue, Chen Weiwen, Zhen Yin.</p>

<p>The Trunk Murder Case Comes to Light</p>
<p>The murderer is a rogue Portuguese youth. The victims are two beautiful Guangdong women. They were initially very fond of each other, but suddenly fell out. The murderer's brother assisted in moving the bodies to Japan. The Shanghai Jiulun (Ninth Round) trunk murder case has undergone a fundamental change since Chen Qiaoying went to the Japanese consulate in Japan to prove that the victim was not herself. The Japanese Consul General's Police Chief Hanari and Section Chiefs Sato and Aiko personally took charge of the investigation. At the same time, Hanari personally went to the British and French concessions to request the cooperation of the police authorities. It is unprecedented in Shanghai for an international manhunt to be mobilized for one body. As a result of investigations by all parties, the cause of the case has been discovered, and the murderer's residence has also been surrounded and searched. The details of this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Investigating from the Evidence</h3>
<p>After the trunk used to contain the body, the rope used to bind the body, and other items were brought back to Shanghai from the Ninth Round, Police Chief Hanari of the Japanese Consulate General and the British Concession Police authorities studied the evidence. As a result, fingerprints were discovered. Following this lead, police officers Hanari, Sato, and Aiko led many officers to investigate. After a day and two nights of searching, a Portuguese youth named Badrick Le Reni Dieo was suddenly found to be a prime suspect in the case. It was discovered that the Portuguese man's father was Portuguese and his mother was Japanese, and Badrick Le Reni Dieo was a mixed-race individual. The woman in the trunk murder case was the one killed by Badri.</p>
<h3>The Cause of the Heinous Murder</h3>
<p>The Portuguese man, Badrick Le Reni Dieo, was 23 years old and lived in House No. 174, Letter C, Yifeng Lane, Kunshan Road in this city. He had four brothers and two sisters, who were prostitutes. Badrick Le Reni Dieo's character was also unruly. On the 3rd of this month, the Portuguese man originally lived in House No. 15, Jiaxing Road, with a Guangdong woman surnamed Lu (the female corpse of the heinous murder). The two's love was very passionate. They often went to dance halls and toured Beiyuan. On the night of the 3rd, the two had a quarrel in the building at No. 15 Jiaxing Road, which escalated into a major argument. At that time, a police officer happened to pass by and entered to inquire. The Portuguese man immediately turned off all the lights in the room and claimed to be Korean, indicating that he would not accept police interference. The police officer had to leave, and the tragedy occurred at this time.</p>
<h3>Moving House to Hide After the Murder</h3>
<p>The Portuguese man, Badrick Le Reni Dieo Patric Redediao, first quarreled with the Guangdong woman, Lu, and then resorted to violence. At that time, the Portuguese man severely beat the Guangdong woman, seemingly using fists to repeatedly strike her, causing injuries to her chest. After knocking her down, Badrick Le Reni Dieo used a rope to strangle the woman to death, leading to the tragedy. After the tragedy occurred, the Portuguese man Badri's brother was also present. He proposed buying a trunk, placing the female corpse inside, and devising a way to transport it to another port. Badri listened to his brother's idea, bought a black trunk, and placed the bound corpse inside. This matter was unknown to anyone except the two murderers present. On the 4th, he hired a rickshaw to transport the trunk containing the corpse to the Huishan Wharf and transported it to Kobe, Japan. After transporting the female corpse, Badrick Le Reni Dieo fled from Jiaxing Road and lived with his father at Yifeng Lane, Kunshan Road, to avoid the rumors.</p>
<h3>The Woman Was Once a Relief Worker</h3>
<p>It is heard that the murdered woman, Lu, graduated from a Guangdong women's high school. When Qu Pufang was the director of the Guangzhou Finance Department, the woman surnamed Lu once worked in the Finance Department, so her literary skills were quite good, but her character was frivolous. Therefore, she resigned not long after and came to Shanghai. During the January 28th Incident, the woman participated in the work of providing relief to wounded soldiers and refugees after the Battle of Miaohang. After the war, the woman Lu met a Portuguese youth, and their friendship turned into love, and they began living together. The woman Lu's appearance was very beautiful. Recently, because of dancing, she had other boyfriends outside, and the Portuguese youth suddenly became jealous. At first, they argued, but the woman refused to yield, leading to a tragic murder caused by jealousy. This was completely unexpected.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Arrest the Real Murderer</h3>
<p>The initiation of this tragedy was by Badrick Le Reni Dieo, and the transportation of the trunk to Japan after the murder was assisted by the murderer's brother, named Zorr Jal. After Japanese Police Chief Hanari, Sato, Aiko, etc., understood the situation, they reported to the Japanese Consul and consulted with the Public Works Department Police to arrest the murderer. On the one hand, they requested the Portuguese Consul to sign an arrest warrant and discussed the extradition of the murderer to the Japanese Consulate for questioning after his capture. Because these procedures took a long time, Police Chief Hanari feared that the criminal might hear the news and escape. Therefore, yesterday morning, he secretly dispatched a large group of detectives to surround House No. 174, Letter C, Yifeng Lane, Kunshan Road. After the arrest warrant was signed and issued, they immediately implemented the arrest and interrogation plan. This bizarre trunk murder case has now come to light. It has been found that the murderer, Badrick Le Reni Dieo, was born to a father named Le Reni Dieo and a Japanese woman named Nakamura. A month ago, he rented the house at No. 15 Jiaxing Road. His brother, Zorr, is 26 years old this year. His behavior was that of a juvenile delinquent. This plan for transporting the corpse, etc., was entirely advocated by him. We will continue to investigate the outcome.</p>
<h3>Municipal Inspectorate Guan Yan Extorted and Scammed Under the Pretext of Searching for Flower Meetings</h3>
<p>Went to the Xinya Restaurant to Negotiate</p>
<p>Guan Yan, an inspector from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and four hired associates, including Wang Tian, went to the home of Li Wang, a Ningbo woman on North Sichuan Road, and extorted money and threatened with guns under the pretext of searching for flower meetings. They also beat a man named Zhang who was in her room. The Fifth District Police Station learned of this and sent police to the Xinya Restaurant.</p>
<h3>Air Ticket Special Prize Money</h3>
<p>Already Collected by HSBC Bank on Behalf of the Winner</p>
<p>The winner is Confirmed to be a Western Woman</p>
<p>Regarding the winner of the special prize in the aviation highway construction lottery, various newspapers have already reported it. Yesterday, a reporter went to the Central Bank to visit the bank manager, Mr. Xi Demao, to find out the truth. According to Mr. Xi, an employee of HSBC Bank recently contacted the bank on behalf of the winner and requested that the prize money be paid to the bank for collection. Mr. Xi met with him and, after inquiring about his intentions, agreed on the spot because the bank was collecting the money, which would avoid various troubles. The full amount was immediately transferred the next day. However, the winner did not want to disclose her name, so Mr. Xi did not pursue the matter. But it is confirmed that she is a Western woman.</p>
<p>, and detained Guan Yan and Wang Tian, escorting them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and transferring them to the local court. Prosecutor Yang Qianchang opened the trial yesterday morning. Judge Yang Qianchang opened the trial yesterday morning. Lawyer Wang Shou'an, hired by Guan Yan, appeared in court to defend him. The judge asked Guan Yan to testify. He stated that he was 31 years old, from Sanshui, Guangdong, and lived at No. 125 Lai'an Lane, Zhabei. He had been working as an inspector for only a few months. Someone said that Li Wang's family had a flower meeting listening device, so he went to take a look alone. Later, when Wang Tian and others went, he did not go. The judge asked if he carried a gun when he went. He replied that he did. He asked if he had bullets. He replied that he did. He asked if he admitted it at the Public Security Bureau. He replied that he did, but it was under duress. The judge asked Wang Tian to testify. He stated that he was 35 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong, and worked as an accountant on the merchant steamship Yu Shun. He knew Guan Yan because he had participated in a one-yuan flower meeting at Li Wang's house a week ago. He was furious and unexpectedly won. Because she did not pay, he confiscated her flower meeting paper, twenty-four sheets, and one picture, three thousand and fifty copper coins, and one abacus and reported it to the police. The judge sternly reprimanded him, asking who he was that he could arrest people, clearly accusing him of planting evidence and robbing money. Then he asked Li Wang to testify. She stated that she was 23 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 61 North Sichuan Road. When the judge asked her husband's name, she hesitated for a long time before saying that his name was Li Jinsheng. He asked how old her husband was. She replied that he was 19 years old and worked at a machine factory in Hankou. She got married last year. He asked where she lived. She replied that she lived in the side room. He asked if Zhang was her lover. She replied that he was not. He asked why he was in her room. She replied that he was there to collect money for ice cream. He asked if Zhang was beaten. She replied that he was slapped four times. Four people came at the time. Guan Yan pointed a gun at her, and Wang Tian and others ransacked the boxes, robbing her of twenty-eight yuan in foreign currency and corner copper coins. But she was just a weak woman and did not participate in flower meetings. At that time, she and Zhang were taken to the third floor of the Xinya Restaurant and told to ask her old friends to talk things over. She had no choice but to call Wang, a friend of her husband, at No. 5 Tang Wan Yu Shun Fang, telephone number 83711, and ask him to come and help. By the time Wang arrived, the police had also arrived, and the other two had escaped. Now they are threatening her, saying that if she accuses them in court, the defendants will kill her, etc. She requested that the matter be investigated. The judge asked where she got the abacus. She replied that her grandfather ran a cigarette paper shop in Japan and left it behind. At this point, the judge adjourned the court, pending further questioning when Zhang arrived. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Bride Switched</h3>
<p>A Beautiful Woman Transforms into a Clubfooted, Pockmarked Face</p>
<p>Gong Gengchu Was Extremely Angry</p>
<p>Chen Fulin Found it Difficult to Explain</p>
<p>Gong Gengchu, 48 years old, from Gaoqiao, runs a grocery business. His family lives in the countryside of Gaoqiao. Two years ago, he fell ill and lacked care, so he called his wife to Shanghai to rent a house in Hengxing Lane, Wanyu Street, Nanshi. Gong gradually recovered, but his wife became ill and died despite medical treatment last spring. Gong was extremely saddened and sighed constantly. A friend, Chen Fulin, from Nanxiang, saw this and said to Gong, "Don't be so sad about your wife's death. You're not that old, and you can remarry. There are many women in my hometown. I'll help you find one. If there's a suitable woman, I'll act as a matchmaker for you. Marrying a woman from the countryside is very frugal, and the betrothal gifts are especially cheap." Then he left. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, Chen came again and took out a photo for Gong to look at, saying, "This woman is 26 years old and very beautiful. Her father, Wang Zhuxian, used to work in the government in the Eastern Provinces. He only has one daughter, named Aibao. Her father loves her very much. Friends and relatives have acted as matchmakers, but she has refused them all, so she is still unmarried. But her father died of a sudden illness last year. Wang's wife and daughter returned to their ancestral home in Zhenru with the coffin. The daughter graduated from middle school. My sister is her neighbor. I asked my sister to act as a matchmaker at her house. The woman's mother agreed. The day before yesterday, my sister and I went together. I told her about your business and remarriage, and the woman's mother was very happy. She immediately discussed the betrothal gifts. The woman's mother said she wouldn't haggle. If you don't marry this woman, it will be difficult to find one like her. A beautiful woman." Gong was moved by his words and asked him to arrange the marriage. After discussing the wedding arrangements, he gave Chen 400 yuan in betrothal gifts and four pieces of gold jewelry in December last year to take to the woman's home. Then he chose the auspicious date of the 5th of this month for the wedding. Gong's house was old, so he moved to his relative's house in Tangjiawan and sent out invitations to relatives and friends for a celebratory feast, preparing everything very busily. On the wedding day, a new-style car led by the matchmaker Chen Fulin took the bride to Gong's house for the wedding. Relatives and friends flocked to see the bride, but unexpectedly, he married a clubfooted, pockmarked woman who was over thirty years old. Gong was immediately furious and unwilling to marry her. After persuasion from relatives and friends, he married the bride. But the matchmaker Chen Fulin took the bride and left, never to return. Gong thought that Chen should not have deceived him and has been searching everywhere recently to negotiate with him.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Crushes Child to Death, Inciting Crowd to Beat Workers</h3>
<p>Four to Five Hundred People Gather at Tanziawan and Shout to Beat the Mechanics and Ticket Collectors</p>
<p>The Driver Responsible for the Accident Has Been Detained</p>
<p>At around 9 a.m. yesterday, a China Merchants Public Bus at Tanziawan, Zhabei, injured a passerby and fell into the canal, crushing a young child to death, causing a crowd to gather and beat the workers. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Bus Falls into Canal</h3>
<p>Wang Pan, 48 years old, from Jiangbei, lived in a shack in Tanziawan, Zhabei, and made a living by picking up old cloth and garbage. The woman had a son named Xiaofuzi, 8 years old. At around 9 a.m. yesterday, a Zhabei China Merchants Public Bus with license plate No. 4929 was driving from Zhenru to Shanghai fully loaded with passengers. When the bus was accelerating and driving near Dayang Bridge, Xiaofuzi suddenly rushed out of the shack, intending to cross the road. When the bus driver, Zhu Chengxiu, saw this, he was driving too fast to brake. Fearing that he would injure the child, he quickly turned the bus to the right to avoid him. Unexpectedly, at that time, a local man named Xia Ashi, 68 years old, was standing on the right side of the road. He bore the brunt of the impact and was knocked down by the bus, injuring his head and other parts of his body. When the bus driver saw this, he panicked and lost control. He forgot to straighten the bus. As a result, the bus fell into the canal on the side of the road.</p>
<h3>Child's Body Suddenly Appears Under the Bus</h3>
<p>For a moment, there was a clamor of voices, and no one could call for help. Fortunately, the driver had stopped the bus, so the passengers in the bus only suffered from the shock and were not injured. They immediately found a way to climb out of the windows. The Fourth District Police Station heard the alarm and quickly sent police to suppress the situation. They first sent Xia Atu to the hospital for treatment and detained the driver, Zhu Chengxiu, and sent him to the Fourth District Headquarters. At the same time, they searched for the whereabouts of the child who caused the accident, but they could not find him. They assumed that he had run away to avoid punishment and stopped looking. They then reported to the bus company, ordering them to immediately send mechanics to find a way to lift the bus. At around 2 p.m., the company sent a large group of workers, coppersmiths, and ticket collectors to the scene of the accident to investigate and began to lift the bus. At 4:50 p.m., they finally turned the bus over. Unexpectedly, a child's body was suddenly found under the bus.</p>
<h3>Four to Five Hundred People Shout to Beat</h3>
<p>At that time, the nearby residents watching nearby suddenly rioted. After much questioning, it was discovered that the child's body was Xiaofuzi. It was thought that he had been dragged into the canal by the bus and died. At the same time, his mother, Wang Pan, also heard the news and rushed to the scene. When she saw this, she burst into tears and tried to question the company's workers and coppersmiths. Unexpectedly, the coppersmiths saw that the situation was not good and tried to drive away. As a result, the woman rushed to the front of the bus to block the road and frantically shouted for help. As a result, the residents of the shacks along Dayang Bridge in Tanziawan came out to watch. When they saw this situation, four to five hundred people gathered together without being asked. They all felt sorry for the woman. The crowd was noisy, and there were good and bad people among them. With a shout to beat, the crowd of residents rushed towards the bus, indiscriminately beating the workers, coppersmiths, and ticket collectors.</p>
<h3>Workers Injured</h3>
<p>By the time the police arrived, Qian Yabing, 21 years old, a local ticket collector, and Chao Bing, 22 years old, a Guangdong coppersmith, had been beaten and injured in the waist and abdomen and were lying on the ground. Six or seven workers were also slightly injured. When they tried to arrest the perpetrators, they had all scattered. The police chief and others took Wang Pan and the workers and coppersmiths who were working at the time but were not beaten into the police station and sent the injured ticket collectors to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. That evening, they prepared a document to send to the Fourth District Headquarters with the one thousand people they had detained. After District Chief Lai interrogated them, he ordered that they be temporarily detained, pending review.</p>

<p>Yangyangshan Pirate Leader Zhu Songzhou Arrested in Shanghai</p>
<h3>His Gang Resisted Government Troops and Kidnapped People for Ransom. Zhu Was Arrested and Escorted to the Maritime Public Security Bureau Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Zhu Songzhou, 43 years old, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, was formerly the captain of the Maritime Patrol Team of the Yangtze River Provinces Water Police Headquarters. Since his dismissal, he secretly led a gang of more than 200 members, occupying Xiaoyangshan Island in the outer sea, and repeatedly committed heinous cases of murder and extortion. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission once ordered troops to severely suppress them. The Military Affairs Commission has now learned that Zhu Songzhou is hiding in the Shanghai concession area. Therefore, it secretly ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to issue an arrest warrant. The Fourth District Detective Team of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Bureau discovered that Zhu was hiding at No. 5 Renyuan Lane, Geluo Road, French Concession. At around 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, Dai Junqing, deputy director of the Fourth District Detective Team, took a document to the French Concession Police, ordering the first group of detectives, Liu Dianlong, to cooperate and arrest Zhu, bringing him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Branch. First, the police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, stated that the police had received a report from Dai Junqing, deputy director of the Fourth District Detective Team of the Maritime Provincial Public Security Bureau, and ordered the detectives to cooperate in arresting Zhu. Since the case occurred inland, the court should allow the officers to take him away. The police did not object and presented the official documents for review. Then, Dai Junqing stated that since his dismissal, the defendant had led his gang on the sea around Xiaoyangshan Island, repeatedly committing heinous cases of murder and extortion. Later, troops were sent to suppress them, but the defendant's gang members opened fire to resist arrest, killing many government soldiers. Several accomplices were captured on the spot and confessed that the defendant was the ringleader. Therefore, a secret order was issued for his strict arrest. Now that he has been arrested, he requested permission to extradite him back to the case for interrogation and presented the secret order for review. When questioned, Zhu Songzhou stated that since he was dismissed in June, he had been living peacefully in Shanghai and had never colluded with gangs to commit robbery. The rest of his statements were evasive. Judge Wang Gangxi ordered that Zhu Songzhou be handed over to the officers to be taken away and brought back to the case for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Sun Temple Monk Runs Flower Meeting and Sells Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Secretly Arranged for Young Woman to Provide Milk to Nourish Buddhist Disciple, Sin is Not Light</p>
<p>The Monk and Young Woman Were Arrested Together</p>
<p>Lang Qing, a monk from Taizhou and the abbot of the Sun Temple on Datong Road, Zhabei, and Yue Jing, along with several old monks, ostensibly practiced purity and abstinence, but in reality, they were capable of any evil. They privately established a flower meeting organization, equipped with many bamboo tubes for seeking flower meeting lots, specializing in luring general superstitious and ignorant men and women to pray and divine, profiting from them. They also colluded with bandits to sell counterfeit Chinese and Central South Banknotes, using them in the market, profiting greatly, and even enjoying themselves freely. They secretly arranged for Wang Wumei, a young woman from Shaoxing living at No. 42 Hongqing Lane, to come to the temple every morning to provide breast milk to the monk Yue Qing to suck and nourish himself, and there was also ambiguous behavior. The matter was not kept secret and was discovered by detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. They reported to the team, and the team dispatched officers to join forces with the police from the Fourth District to arrest the monk Lang Qing the night before last and seized two ten-yuan counterfeit Chinese banknotes, five five-yuan counterfeit Central South banknotes, and many flower meeting gambling tools. They then went to Hongqing Lane to arrest Wang Wumei and others, bringing them all to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Pay Attention to Street Cleaning, Hoping for Citizen Cooperation</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau believes that street cleaning is of great importance to the prevention of epidemics. It has established a street cleaning section in the bureau, specializing in this matter, with an annual budget of approximately 130,000 yuan. Recently, it also hired a sanitary engineer, Ma Yuji, from the Health Department to assist in Shanghai. Mr. Ma has already arrived at the bureau to work and has been inspecting the cleanliness of the streets in the city for several days. In order to prevent epidemics, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate with the government in paying attention to street cleaning work.</p>
<h3>After the Completion of the Two Roads Hospital, All Sectors Were Invited to Visit Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Director, Luo Furong, Reported on the Preparations. Hospitalization is Temporarily Limited to Employees Themselves, and Expansion is Planned.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hospital of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, after preparations, was completed on the 17th of last month and began admitting patients and providing outpatient services. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., all sectors were invited to visit, including Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Zou Zhengjian, and Song Fuji, members of the executive and supervisory committees of the Special Party Department of the Two Roads; Yan Shanfang, Director of the General Audit Office of the Roads; Mo Heng, Director of the General Affairs Department; Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Vehicle Affairs Department; and more than fifty senior staff and employees of the Two Roads Labor Union and the Two Roads, who were received by the hospital director, Luo Furong, and the head of the sanitation section, Huang Yucai, who showed them around the wards and various facilities and provided refreshments until 5 p.m. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Preparations</h3>
<p>Director Luo and Section Chief Huang told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporters yesterday that the Two Roads only had a clinic at the North Station in Shanghai. In case of serious illnesses and injuries requiring surgery or hospitalization, patients were transferred to Renji Hospital for treatment, with the Roads Bureau subsidizing 1,500 yuan per year for medical expenses and charging additional hospitalization fees. To facilitate treatment, the Sanitation Section of the General Affairs Department established the Shanghai Hospital of the Two Roads at the old site of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Hospital on Laobazi Road. Since its preparation, it was completed on the 17th of last month. The repair of the building and the addition of equipment cost approximately 6,000 yuan in start-up expenses, which were allocated from the surplus of the medical expenses budget for the twenty-first year and did not increase the budget. The recurring expenses were covered by the surplus funds. (1) Streamlined the procedures for purchasing and managing medicines and formulated regulations for the management of medical equipment. The drug and material expenses in the medical expenses budget for this year were reduced by approximately 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. (2) Canceled the subsidy and hospitalization fees for the transferred hospitals, saving approximately 10,000 yuan per year. (3) Reduced the distribution of summer disinfection solutions and emergency medicines with little practical use, saving approximately 2,000 yuan in the sanitation expenses budget for this year, for a total of approximately 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Equipment and Organization</h3>
<p>The hospital is directly under the Sanitation Section of the General Affairs Department of the Two Roads Administration. It has one director who also serves as the chief surgeon (Luo Furong), one resident physician (Shen Duo), one chief physician of internal medicine (Qian Jianchu), one chief physician of dermatology and urology (Chen Mingzhu), one chief physician of ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and rhinology (Zhang Ximing), one head nurse (Shi Xuelin), seven nurses, one pharmacist, and 25 beds temporarily. It has one hygiene room and one lecture hall. However, an X-ray machine has not yet been purchased. From July 17th to August 10th, it has admitted 50 patients and provided outpatient services to an average of 100 people per day. Currently, due to limited funding, hospitalization is only available to employees themselves, and outpatient services are available to employees' family members and themselves. When funding is sufficient, it is planned to expand, increase the number of beds, and admit employees' family members, and purchase equipment.</p>
<h3>Improved Pig Slaughter by Artificial Inflation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Health, in order to improve the method of inflating pigs during slaughter, submitted a request to the Municipal Government for review. Yesterday, Directive No. 7019 of the Municipal Government was received approving it. The original request stated that, in order to improve the method of inflating pigs during slaughter for record-keeping purposes, it has been the practice of butchers in this city to inflate the pig's subcutaneous tissue by blowing air into it with their mouths for the sake of easy washing and scraping. However, because the lung capacity of the human body is limited, the person blowing air must first inhale as much air as possible before exhaling it. To inflate one pig, one often has to use more than ten deep breaths. Butchers who do this for a long time are most susceptible to lung injuries. Furthermore, the pig's body is filthy, and contact with the mouth easily leads to infection by various germs. If the butcher has an infectious disease, he can spread the germs into the fresh meat. It has been found that foreign concessions have already switched to using air pumps for inflation. Therefore, for the sake of hygiene and appearance, it is proposed to order slaughterhouses in the city to stop using artificial inflation and switch to using air pumps. It is appropriate to submit this document for review and approval for record-keeping.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Association Seeks Assistance for Flood Victims in Pudong</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Yangjing Defense Corps to the Chinese Jisheng Association, a large fire in Laobaidu, Pudong, on the ninth of this month, burned down more than 500 thatched houses, leaving thousands of people homeless. The association sent Mr. Li Yunmen yesterday to investigate. The disaster area is in a dire state. Under the scorching heat of the summer, the people have no shelter or food. By day, they are exposed to the scorching sun, and by night, they suffer from hunger and sleep in the open. The tragic situation is hard to describe in full. It is said that the association's finances are strained, and it hopes that charitable organizations at sea can help with the relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Alcohol Exports to China Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Alarming Annual Losses</p>
<p>Alcohol is a major product in industry and chemistry. Apart from the alcohol factory that the Ministry of Industry is currently planning to build in Shanghai, there are no other specialized factories manufacturing alcohol in our country. As a result, we rely entirely on other countries for supply. The annual loss of silver is approximately 6 million taels. Most of the imports come from the Dutch East Indies and Germany and the amount from Taiwan, which belongs to Japan, is also very large. A reporter interviewed Mr. Ji Zejin, director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, yesterday, who said that the recent news on alcohol exports from Taiwan to China is as follows: Since the spring of 1931, due to the adverse effects of the Japanese government's lifting of the gold embargo, alcohol exports from Taiwan to China have sharply decreased. A check of the whole year of 1931 shows that the export of alcohol to China was only 1,276,120 liters, worth more than 329,000 yuan. Compared with the export volume of more than 6,050,000 liters in 1930, the decrease was an unexpected one. Although the Japanese government re-imposed the ban on gold exports in 1932, the impact of the Sino-Japanese situation continued to depress alcohol exports to China. However, looking at the cumulative export volume from January to the end of November last year, it reached more than 1,607,000 liters, which is a considerable increase compared to 1931. The following is a list of the quantity and value of alcohol exported from Taiwan to China from 1929 to the end of November last year (quantity unit: liter, value unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Year Quantity Amount</p>
<p>1929 9,976,910 2,516,300</p>
<p>1930 6,050,614 1,487,870</p>
<p>1931 1,376,120 329,714</p>
<p>1932 (January-End of November) 1,677,750 417,243</p>
<p>Also, since December of last year, due to the rise in silver prices and the easing of the anti-Japanese sentiment in China, many people have suddenly gone to Taiwan from China to order large quantities of alcohol. Among them, it is known that someone has ordered 700 "names" (70,000 liters) of alcohol from the Imperial Sugar Manufacturing Company.</p>
<h3>The Achievements of the Mental Hospital</h3>
<p>The January 28th Incident Created a Breeding Ground for Mental Illness</p>
<p>Recently, the number of men and women suffering from mental illness who have been sent to the Shanghai Mental Hospital on Guling Road, Ren'an Lane, in this city has been overwhelming, creating a situation similar to that on Shanyin Road, where one is too busy to handle all the cases. It is because Dr. Gu Wenjun, the director of the hospital, is a seventh-generation specialist in treating mental illness from Chuansha. He practiced medicine in the Tianjin area in his early years and enjoyed a great reputation. Recently, he retired due to old age and returned to Shanghai to practice medicine. Based on his expertise, he is committed to helping the world. For the poor and sick, he does not care about medical expenses. It is reported that the hospital has accepted five or six mentally ill patients sent by the court for treatment in half a month. Most of them have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. There are still Mr. Xu from Guangdong, Zhou A'gen from Jiangsu, and Wang Qingyuan from the local area, who were all seriously ill with mental illness and were sent to the hospital for treatment one after another. After about three weeks of hospitalization, they all recovered and were taken back by their families. According to Mr. Gu, the reason why there are so many mentally ill people recently is mostly due to the Japanese invaders. Because of the January 28th Incident, their homes were burned down, their wives and children were lost, and even their entire families were robbed and their property destroyed. As a result, they suffered great stimulation, their nerves were disordered, and they became mentally ill. The situation is very pitiful.</p>
<h3>Tonghua Steamer Recovers Lost Anchor and Sails to Shanghai as Usual</h3>
<p>The Tonghua steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which travels between Shanghai and Haizhou, lost its iron anchor when it was hit by the Beijin steamer at Dapu the other day while sailing from Haizhou to Shanghai. They immediately tried to salvage it, but were unable to find it. As a result, the Tonghua steamer was moored in Dapu and dared not sail. At the same time, a barge was hired for salvage. It was not until 1:00 PM on the 11th of this month that the anchor was recovered. It was then loaded onto the chain, and at 2:00 PM, the steamer sailed to Shanghai as usual. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a telegram the night before last informing them that the steamer would arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 AM today, the 13th, and would dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf on 16th Pier.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai South Office of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association Urges the Collection of Autumn Licenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association in this city, because the tobacco and alcohol license tax office intended to increase the level of collection, entrusted the association to collect the licenses on behalf of the various businesses in the same industry to reduce the burden. Since the office has issued the licenses on behalf of the businesses, there are still dozens of businesses such as Beiyongtai that have not yet collected them. The office is now about to close down, and yesterday it issued a notice saying, "Dear Sir/Madam, previously, this firm was entrusted by your company to collect the autumn tobacco and alcohol license on your behalf, which has been collected and sent to the office. We sent staff to distribute them, but some businesses said that they had not seen the receipt and no one collected the licenses, so the licenses have not been delivered. We hereby send a special letter to inform you that you must come to the office to collect the licenses on the day you receive this notice. If you still do not come to collect them, this office is eager to close down and will return the licenses to the tax office. This office will not be responsible for any increase in the license fee in the future."</p>
<h3>Residents of the Yinxiang District Petition the Authorities to Prohibit Feces Collectors from Forcibly Collecting Monthly Fees</h3>
<p>The residents of Hujiaqiao Road, Tongjia Road, Wuhua Road, Tiantong Road, Zhangjiagang Road, Hongzhen, and Liulu in the Yinxiang District of this city, in order to oppose the extortion of night soil fees, elected eleven representatives and set up a temporary office inside the Youjiaqiao Fire Station. Yesterday, they jointly submitted petitions to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Health, requesting an explanation and prohibition. The original text of the petition is as follows: "We hereby petition for the feces collectors' extortion and disregard for regulations, and respectfully request an explanation and a prohibition order to ensure the peace of the people and avoid harassment. Since the implementation of the general donation order in this city, it is forbidden to create new names and collect fees within the city limits. This is what the citizens have seen and heard. Unexpectedly, in July of this year, the feces collectors in the [Yinxiang] District started to collect night soil fees, charging five cents per night soil bucket per month, euphemistically calling it a special subsidy fee. They are enforcing it from house to house, not allowing any delays, and even threatening that if the fee is not paid, the night soil will not be removed. After the Bureau of Health learned about this, it issued Directive No. 1577 prohibiting it on record. However, the feces collectors are emboldened and disregard the regulations as mere formalities, and continue to extort the fees. Even on August 4, because the fee was not paid, they beat the old woman of Liu Xiao Jiu Zi's family in Tianfeng Lane, Zhangjiagang Road, which was recorded by the Third Police Station of the Fifth District. The service of the feces collectors originally has a considerable wage, and the people also give them gratuities during the three major festivals each year. Their treatment is already not bad. However, they are thinking out of the box and creating a new name of special subsidy fee to extort money. Isn't this insatiable? The so-called special subsidy implies the voluntary consent of the people, but now it is being forcibly implemented by the feces collectors. Is this not a forceful violation of the people's will? It is also cunning. It is estimated that there are no less than 14,000 households in our district. If each household has four night soil buckets, which is calculated at two jiao per household, then the monthly collection is about 3,000 yuan, which is distributed among the 60 existing feces collectors. Each person can receive about 50 yuan of special benefits per month in addition to the original wages and festival fees. The shortcut to getting rich is beyond the reach of other workers. If this leads to road workers, lamplighters, street sweepers, etc. following suit, what will our people have left? In short, the perpetrators of this night soil fee are indeed well-calculated, and the exceptional losses and unexpected harassment suffered by our people are truly unbearable. Currently, because the actions of the feces collectors are barbaric and cannot be reasoned with, and the people have many questions, they automatically gathered for a meeting on August 6 and elected the presenters as representatives of Liulu to present this petition with attachments. In addition to presenting this petition to the Municipal Government for explanation, we respectfully ask your Bureau to provide an explanation as to whether it is reasonable for the feces collectors to collect the above-mentioned fees in order to dispel the doubts of the public. If the matter is considered harassment and close to extortion, then please order your subordinates to strictly prohibit it, so as to prevent illegal actions and maintain the peace of the people and end the harassment. We eagerly await your orders."</p>
<h3>Shen Ruilin's Daughter Wanru Petitions for Divorce from Her Husband Li Dingshi</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the High Court Summoned Lawyers from Both Sides to Mediate</p>
<p>Neither Party Was in Shanghai</p>
<p>Li Dingshi, the general manager of Huimin Milk Powder Company, previously married Ms. Shen Wanru. (Ms. Shen is the daughter of Shen Ruilin, the former Austrian Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the current director of the Chinese Eastern Railway.) Now, Li Shen Wanru has hired lawyer Dong Yu to draft a petition to the Local Court Mediation Office for divorce from her husband Li Dingshi. The petition states that the petitioner, Li Wanru, is 27 years old and from Wuxing, Zhejiang. Since their marriage, they have had four children (three boys and one girl). At first, they were still harmonious, but unexpectedly, over time, their relationship became estranged. Recently, Dingshi has had an affair and abandoned the petitioner. Her treatment is cruel and unbearable. Dingshi and the other woman are renting a house together. The facts are all there. The petitioner believes that since the affection between Dingshi and herself has been lost and it is difficult to reconcile, she requests a divorce and, based on her current living situation, a one-time payment of 100,000 yuan for living expenses, etc., based on Dingshi's financial resources. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Shicheng held a court session for mediation. Neither party was present. Lawyer Zhang Ding appeared in court on behalf of the petitioner, and lawyer Ling Qihong appeared on behalf of the respondent. First, lawyer Zhang stated that the petitioner, Li Shen Wanru, is currently in Qingdao, so she did not appear in court. He also stated the petitioner's age and origin, and that since the two were formally married and had four children, and the respondent had an affair, the petitioner requested a divorce and a one-time payment of 100,000 yuan, etc. Next, lawyer Ling stated that Li Dingshi is currently in Harbin, so he did not appear in court. He said that his relationship with the petitioner is quite good, and that the recent affair is a misunderstanding. It is best to mediate outside of court to avoid creating a rift in the couple's relationship. He requested a postponement. The judge asked lawyer Zhang, who also expressed agreement with out-of-court mediation. The answer was that a limit of two weeks was given. Lawyer Ling thought the time was too short, and after further consultation, it was decided to conduct mediation outside of court within three weeks. Telegrams were sent to the parties concerned to return to China as soon as possible to facilitate the process. If mediation fails, a request will be made for a collective hearing and ruling.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Police Officers Falsely Accuse Station Chief</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Sent Personnel to Investigate and Ordered Arrest and Punishment</p>
<p>Liu Wanxiang and Zhang Xianzhang, police officers of the No. 1 Precinct of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau of this city, have repeatedly gone out privately to extort money and cause trouble, and did not abide by the rules while on duty. They were discovered and punished by the Inspection Division of the Public Security Bureau on June 30 and July 13. On July 3, while on duty, they were writing lottery tickets in a certain cigarette shop, which was discovered by Patrol Officer Qi Bin, who rebuked them. However, Police Officer Liu Wanxiang insulted and scolded him. Also, after going off duty at 12:00 PM on July 7, they put on plain clothes and went out privately. Suddenly, they had a brawl with citizens Hong Xitong, Lu A'fu, Li Yuxiang, and Song Lizhi. The four citizens, Hong Xitong, were arrested by Police Officers Liu Wanxiang and Zhang Xizhang and detained in the precinct. After Patrol Officer Wang Jia'an inquired about the situation, it was confirmed that the police officers were unreasonable. However, the citizens should not have used violence against the police officers, so each was fined two yuan in accordance with Article 50 of the Anti-Violation Punishment Law. The police officers were rebuked and sent back to their substation to await punishment. Unexpectedly, Police Officer Liu Wanxiang and others still harbored evil intentions and went to Minguo Road to brawl and make trouble. Station Chief Shen Zhenhua learned of this and was furious. Because the police officers had repeatedly been involved in fighting and causing trouble, he requested their dismissal on July 15, which was approved by the Bureau. However, the dismissed police officers did not repent and instead fabricated accusations against the station chief to the Public Security Bureau and the court, and extorted money from the station chief. After the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to investigate the matter thoroughly, the following Order No. 984 was issued: "According to the complaint filed by dismissed police officers Zhang Xianzhang and Liu Wanxiang against the station chief for condoning murderers and dismissing them without cause, we have sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, and none of the allegations are true. The police officers do not know how to repent, fabricate facts, and maliciously accuse others, which is very hateful. We hereby order the station chief to comply, pay attention to arresting and punishing them, so as to warn against mischief."</p>
<h3>The Family of the Deceased in the Gambling Arrest Drowning Case Demands Compensation</h3>
<p>In Huijiao, a place in the western countryside of this county, a case of a villager, Zhu Quanlin, drowning occurred on the afternoon of June 23 of this year when patrol police arrested gamblers. Details have been repeatedly recorded in previous newspapers. It is now known that Bureau Member Zhang Rong, Patrol Chief Xie Fengshan, Patrol Officers Jiang Shouen, Xu Enpei, Hua Ke Gong, and Wang Lizhang, etc., who caused the trouble, have been repeatedly interrogated by the District Court Prosecutor's Office and ultimately prosecuted for homicide. There are also Xu Jinhe and Wang Tiekai (both patrol officers), because when the deceased fled into the river, they were still in the teahouse and did not participate in the chase. Moreover, witnesses Zhang Zhongmei (the village head) and Jiang Weishi (the teahouse owner) testified in court. Therefore, the two police officers Xu and Wang were not prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Fachang held a court hearing. The first to testify was the deceased's wife, Zhu Han, 39 years old, from Shanghai, residing in Sanyang Township, Hengqu District. Her husband, Zhu Quanlin, was forced into the river by the patrol police, and they fired shots to prevent him from landing, and also injured his head, causing him to drown. She requested redress. The judge ordered the detainees Zhang Rong, Xie Fengshan, Jiang Shouen, and Xu Enpei, as well as the bailed-out Hua Kekong and Wang Lizhang, to be brought to court for investigation. Their testimonies were mostly evasive. Prosecutor Wu attended the court and gave a statement. The deceased's family hired lawyer Zhang Juansheng to appear in court and requested to bring a private suit, because the deceased still had an 83-year-old mother and five family members, including his wife and daughters, who all depended on the deceased for a living. They demanded compensation of 2,000 yuan and 120 yuan for funeral expenses, and demanded that the defendants jointly compensate them. The judge considered the debate to be over and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 18th of this month. Zhang Rong and others were returned to custody, and Hua Ketai and Wang Lizhang remained on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Japanese Professor at Tongwen College Arrested</h3>
<p>Suspected of Propagating Communism</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that on Sunday, a Japanese professor at Tongwen College on Hongqiao Road was arrested, accused of propagating communism. The professor was dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Education to Shanghai this spring to investigate China's economic situation, and arrived in Shanghai on March 5. Shortly after, he engaged in political activities, which aroused the suspicion of the Japanese police. After the professor was arrested on Sunday, the Japanese consulate police, together with the French Concession police, searched the professor and his wife's residence on Huanlong Road and found many communist documents and books in various languages.</p>

<h3>The German-Austrian-Swiss Alumni Association Hosts Officers and Men of the Emden</h3>
<p>Since the German ship Emden arrived in Shanghai, it has been widely entertained by various parties. The other day (the 10th), at 4:00 PM, Tang Baoshu, Huang Boqiao, Shen Yi, and other members of the German-Austrian-Swiss Alumni Association hosted the officers and men of the Emden, including twenty or thirty officers and trainees from the captain on down, at Tang Garden in Jiangwan.

Among the Chinese guests were Huang Naishu, Ma Junwu, Xu Xinliu, and others, totaling forty people. Tang Garden was exquisitely decorated and had facilities such as a swimming pool. Many of the guests changed into swimsuits and entered the pool to relieve the summer heat. It was not until about 7:00 PM that the hosts and guests parted happily. It is reported that the Emden will host guests from all walks of life this afternoon and set sail tomorrow to leave Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Police Opposes the Transfer of Communist Suspect Chen Pin to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>An Appeal Will Be Made to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>Chen Pin, a graduate of the Faculty of Arts of Fudan University, 25 years old, from Guangdong, and currently an editor at Guanghua Bookstore, was recently identified by the Inspection Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau as the editor of the Communist Workers' Newspaper. So, together with detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, he was arrested at 1:00 AM on the 2nd of this month at Chen's residence at No. 959 Xinzha Road. He was handed over to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. According to Tang Jun, the representative of the Public Security Bureau, Xiang Shangrong, the secretary of the Communist Pudong District, was arrested by the Pudong Third District Public Security Bureau on the 11th of last month. After being handed over to the General Bureau, he voluntarily confessed and implicated the defendant, Chen Pin. The request was made to allow the transfer. However, the French Concession Police stated that the Public Security Bureau must present sufficient evidence before the transfer could be allowed. The court ordered the police to fetch all the files of Xiang Shangrong from the Public Security Bureau for immediate review and verification. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Yu Huating, the Chief Justice of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with Judges Zhao and Jiang, held a continued hearing. Li Zhishan, the lawyer for the French Concession Police, and Xi Yafu, the lawyer representing the defendant Chen Pin, were present. First, Tang Jun, the representative of the Public Security Bureau, stated the facts of the case and presented all the files of Xiang's case. There was a statement of confession from Xiang, which detailed Chen Pin's behavior. When the defendant was questioned about it, he denied joining the Communist Party and holding any position in the Communist Party. The court then released Xiang's case files to the French Concession Police's lawyer for review. The lawyer then stood up and expressed his opinion, saying, "The statement of confession of Xiang Shangrong only mentions 'Xiao Chen' [Little Chen] and does not name him. Not only can it not prove Chen's past, but it is also full of mistakes. This is the first fact. Furthermore, there is no mention of 'Xiao Chen' in the Public Security Bureau Inspection Division's report to the Bureau Chief. Moreover, Xiang Shangrong, who was arrested, was detained at the Third District Public Security Bureau for two weeks. After three interrogations, there was not a single word recorded. And when the defendant was arrested, it was not a formal on-the-spot arrest. It was another Zhang who did it. Because of these doubts, the French Concession Police believes that the evidence presented by the Public Security Bureau is clearly false. Moreover, the French Concession Police has found that the defendant has not committed any crime. We cannot approve the transfer based on empty claims. Therefore, the French Concession Police cannot agree to the transfer." Xi Yafu, the defendant's lawyer, stated, "The reason for the defendant Chen Pin's arrest is that the defendant Chen Pin has a romantic relationship with Chen Jincai, a student at a certain girls' school in Shanghai. But at the same time, Miss Chen is also in love with a certain officer of the Public Security Bureau, which led to a love triangle. The arrest of Chen Pin this time may be due to the love triangle. Please pay attention to the transfer." After discussion between Judge Yu and the two accompanying judges, it was ruled that Chen Pin be allowed to be taken back by the Public Security Bureau personnel for investigation and handling. The lawyers for the French Concession Police and the defendant both stated that they disagreed and would appeal to the Supreme Court. Judge Yu then ruled that the transfer would be suspended during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Road Police Cracks Down on Hooligans at the Station</h3>
<p>At the Shanghai South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM and 7:00 PM every day, when the No. 34 Express Train, No. 38 Slow Train (3rd and 4th class), and No. 36 Express Train from Hangzhou arrive at the South Station, getting on and off the train is extremely crowded. Recently, it has been found that there are more than 20 hooligans near the front and back doors of the station, most of whom are from Jiangbei. They are all unemployed and collude with rickshaw pullers to extort dock fees of thirty or forty cents from customers, or say that they will call for a rickshaw, take them to a certain pier, and transfer them to a boat, purchasing tickets on their behalf and even charging double the price, or taking the opportunity to steal passengers' belongings. This has happened from time to time. If the police come, they will scatter immediately and gather again after the police leave. Such illegal acts are irreparable. The Road Police Department has strictly ordered all chief police officers to cooperate with the local police to strictly investigate and prohibit them. If they encounter the above situation, they will immediately arrest them and send them to the authorities for punishment according to law.</p>
<h3>Arrest Due to Bamboo Gambling Leads to Death from Jumping from Building</h3>
<p>Mahjong Misreported as Lottery</p>
<p>Jia Liang's Death, Alas</p>
<p>At 0:10 AM this morning, the Songshan Road Police Station suddenly received a tip that a lottery was being run at Xu Renshi's house at No. 49 Songchun Lane, Glock Road, and asked them to rush to arrest them. Upon hearing the report, the police chief immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the address and rush upstairs. Unexpectedly, at that time, there were indeed many people playing mahjong upstairs. One of them, named Jia Liang, about 30 years old, heard that the detectives were coming to arrest them. Fearing punishment, he fled to the fourth floor, intending to climb onto the roof of No. 50 via a wooden board. Unexpectedly, the board rotted due to age and suddenly broke. Jia fell down and his head hit the cement, causing his brains to splatter and killing him instantly. The police station immediately notified the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch and ordered a undertaker to carry the body to the mortuary for examination.</p>
<h3>Overturned Alcohol Burns Person to Death</h3>
<p>Ma Jiafu, 16 years old, from Shaoxing, was an apprentice at the Dafaa Laundry Shop on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi. The day before yesterday afternoon, the shop owner ordered him to buy a bottle of alcohol from the Yuanchang Hardware Store across the street. Ma accidentally spilled the alcohol on the counter of the store. Chen Changshun, an apprentice at the store, told him to burn it off with a match. Unexpectedly, the fire was fierce and severely burned Chen's chest. The shop owner rushed him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he was too badly injured and the treatment was ineffective. He died at about 8:00 AM yesterday and was transferred to the mortuary for examination.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Haichang Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>At about 8:40 PM last night, six robbers, all speaking with a Jiangbei accent, broke into the homes of Xia Shunbao and Chen Jida at No. 4 Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei, and the workers' club of the vehicle department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The robbers pulled out their pistols and first drove the victims into a room, where two robbers guarded them with guns, forbidding them from making a sound. The rest went their separate ways to search for valuables. Xia's family was robbed of 85 yuan in silver, 6 jiao in small silver coins, a gold bracelet, two gold rings, four gold earrings, a pair of gold buttons, and a one-sided contract. Chen's family was robbed of 153 yuan in silver, 6 jiao in small silver coins. The workers' club was robbed of 14 yuan in silver, 68 jiao in small silver coins, and more than 1,000 copper coins. The robbers fled with their loot. The victims reported the robbery to the Public Security Bureau in charge, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Dismissal of Appeal of Female Tanhuang Singer Fan Zhenzhen in Li Shiquan Case</h3>
<p>Fan Zhenzhen, a female Tanhua singer who once enjoyed great fame, whose original name was Zhao Peiying, was the adopted daughter of the famous Su Tanhua singers Fan Shaoshan and Fan Zuichun. Later, Miss Zhao had a conflict with the Fan couple. After Zhao hired a lawyer to break off relations with the Fans, she lived with Li Shiquan, the grandson of Li Hongzhang, the former Qing Dynasty Prime Minister. But recently, their opinions suddenly diverged, and Zhao sued Li for deceiving her into marriage and abandonment in the First District Court. Li also hired lawyer E Sen to defend himself, saying that Li had given Miss Zhao a considerable amount of money to break off relations with her and had a written agreement. After the First Special Court inquired and ruled that Li Shiquan was innocent, the part of the incidental civil suit requesting the payment of 30,000 yuan for consolation money was rejected. Zhao Peiying refused to accept the judgment and appealed. Li was still represented by lawyer E Sen. After the Second Branch of the High Court concluded its inquiry, Judge Yu and Judges Zhao and Jiang announced the judgment yesterday morning. The main text of the judgment was to dismiss the appeal.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the editor: After reading the local news column of your newspaper on the 12th of this month, it was reported that a reformed policeman filed a complaint against the director for harboring flower clubs. After the director was accused, the court issued a warrant to arrest him. Hearing this, I was extremely surprised. The content stated in the article is not only mostly untrue, but also intended to damage my reputation by villains. It has been found that unscrupulous people have opened a flower club agency in Yongquanli, Fangbangqiao. On February 7th and July 31st, I supervised the patrol officers and police to crack down on them one after another, and sent the criminals Zhang Qinglai, Zhang Yutang, etc., along with the gambling evidence, to the bureau for legal action. Moreover, in terms of June and July, I have seized 65 flower club cases, all of which have been sent to the general bureau, with records to check. I have been strict in prohibiting flower clubs, but due to the border between Fahua and Minguo Road, it is difficult to eliminate the roots. There is no regret. As for the reformed policemen Liu Wanxiang and Zhang Xianzhang, they were dismissed due to repeated unauthorized outings, fights, and attempts to engage in illegal activities, as well as verbal abuse of patrol officer Qi Bin and other facts. The bureau has issued an order for their dismissal, and there are case files in our office for verification. Now the policemen are spreading rumors and causing trouble, holding grudges and slandering. According to the training order No. 984 of the Public Security Bureau, the police officers Hua Wanxiang and others did not repent after being dismissed, but dared to fabricate facts and file false accusations with hatred, which is very hateful. If there is still any behavior that does not comply with the duties, they should be arrested and punished immediately to warn against evil customs. In short, the right and wrong are clear, the facts are all there, and there is public opinion. There is no need to argue about it. I am only afraid that it will cause confusion. I respectfully request that you correct it. Sincerely, Shen Zhenhua, Director of the First Office of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, August 12th.</p>
<p>To the editor: I have just read in your newspaper that the Land Bureau has re-collected the measurement fee for the Jin Guan soil application measurement case, which is a misunderstanding. It was found that in January of this year, the Jin surname applied for measurement of the land within the twelfth map in the north. Because the area was being cleared and measured, and no notice of exchange of certificates had been issued, half of the measurement fee was ordered to be paid in advance in accordance with the regulations. After investigation, it was found that the household's land had just been cleared and measured, and there was no need for another measurement. The hill number was prepared in advance, and the drawings were made and notified to the bureau for review. According to the Jin surname, one of the two drawings issued was slightly inconsistent, and a request for re-measurement was made, and a re-measurement fee was ordered to be paid in accordance with the regulations. In the area where no notice of exchange of certificates has been issued, the application for measurement cases, without waiting for the notice of exchange of certificates, the preparation of drawings and orders for signature in advance is different from those who come to the bureau to exchange certificates after the notice. Although no separate measurement is required, the measurement fee should still be paid in accordance with the regulations. As for the re-measurement fee ordered to be paid, if the drawings are indeed incorrect after the re-measurement, they should be returned. Correspondingly, the cause of this case is requested to be corrected in your newspaper in order to clarify the facts. Sincerely, the First Section of the Shanghai Land Bureau, August 11th, 22nd.</p>
<h3>Special Article</h3>
<p>Draft Rural Revitalization Plan of the Municipal Social Bureau (Continued)</p>
<p>Second Revitalization Plan</p>
<p>(A) Improvement of agricultural affairs themselves. The improvement methods can be divided into several types. Strictly select varieties of agricultural crops, select the excellent ones to be cultivated, eliminate the inferior ones, retain the strong and remove the weak, and further carry out pure-line breeding, hybrid breeding, etc., to encourage the improvement of varieties. Regarding the improvement of cultivation methods, the farmers in this city mostly broadcast cotton seeds, and rarely sow them in rows or by points. The same is true for rice sowing. The rice seeds are directly planted into the field without the equipment of seedling fields, etc. Therefore, it is extremely inconvenient for weeding, intertillage, fertilizing, preventing diseases and insect pests, and harvesting. There is also more labor, which invisibly reduces income, so it should be improved. Improvement of fertilizers, farm implements, etc. The fertilizers used by general farmers mostly belong to natural fertilizers, and very few use artificial fertilizers (chemical fertilizers). If natural fertilizers and artificial fertilizers can be used in combination, they will complement each other and increase the yield of crops. As for farm implements, they should also be improved. With the advancement of science, all undertakings mostly use machines to save manpower and increase income. Therefore, farm implements should also use machinery, such as water pumps, rice milling machines, rice threshers, and farming machines, etc., all of which should be used to save labor and increase income. Pay attention to the control of diseases and insect pests. Crops are often attacked by various pests (such as rice borers, locusts, cotton bollworms, leaf rollers, etc.) and diseases (such as rice blast, cotton anthracnose, wheat smut, etc.), resulting in a reduction in the yield of crops. Therefore, the government should establish a committee for the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests, which specializes in the responsibilities of prevention, expulsion and treatment, so as to indirectly increase the yield of crops. Expand the agricultural experiment field. As mentioned earlier, the improvement of crop varieties, cultivation and fertilizers must go through considerable experiments and obtain considerable results before farmers can develop faith and then imitate and engage in improvement. Regarding agricultural experiments in this city, there are agricultural cooperative experiment areas, which cooperate with farmers to specialize in the improvement of cotton crops, and there is also an agricultural experiment field, which specializes in the cultivation and improvement experiments of cotton, rice, wheat and beans. However, due to the limited funds, the various facilities are not perfect, and all should be expanded. (B) Encourage side businesses. If farm families can use the land between farms or residential vacant land to engage in side businesses, they can increase their economic income. Animal husbandry side businesses, such as raising chickens, sheep, pigs, ducks, etc., when these livestock are not fully mature, the manure they excrete can be used for farmland fertilizer, and when they are mature, the eggs and meat they produce can get a considerable price. Small handicraft side businesses, such as the weaving of straw hats and whips, the manufacture of osier boxes, and the processing of other agricultural products, can all use farm leisure time to increase income. Fish farming side businesses, using residential ponds, silver to raise fish and shrimp, can not only provide food for themselves, but also sell them on the market to increase economic income. It is found that side businesses can increase farm production, so the government should promote and encourage them. The method is to hold agricultural product exhibitions, collect all the main and side products of farm families and display them in one room, evaluate them and give out prizes to encourage them. Compile and print agricultural primers, about crop cultivation methods, livestock breeding methods, agricultural product processing and treatment, fish farming methods, etc., compile them into vernacular primers, print them into booklets, and distribute them to farmers to promote them. Promote rural organizations,复与 rural finance. In addition to increasing rural industries, attention should also be paid to rural organizations and promoted. The methods should be to organize rural defense groups to maintain the permanent security of rural areas and the safety of rural property, and to organize rural industrial cooperatives, such as sales cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. On the one hand, agricultural products will not be monopolized by unscrupulous merchants, and fair prices can be obtained. At the same time, the items required by farm families are directly purchased from outside by the cooperative, and farmers can obtain items at lower prices, directly or indirectly, to increase the farm family economy.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Summer Special Issue</p>
<h3>I Was Here</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Due to my identity and qualifications, although I longed for Lushan Guling, I finally went against my wishes and came to West Lake.</p>
<p>The water of West Lake is still so green and clear. The mountain peaks are still so strange and beautiful. China truly deserves to be a beautiful country. We should seize the time to fully appreciate it, so as not to waste this scenic spot!</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived at West Lake, I ran around for a whole day, revisiting the scenic spots of the lake and mountains. The reflections of the lake and the light of the mountains are still the same as before. The inscriptions of "I was here," both elegant and popular, are still the same as before. They not only turn white walls black, but also add many "bamboo spots" to Taoguang, with the meaning of a leopard leaving its skin when it dies, and a person leaving a name when they die.</p>
<p>We will not discuss whether these inscriptions can add color to the lake and mountains. Just from my personal point of view, I always feel a little dazzling. This may be because I lack "poetic flavor" too much.</p>
<p>I sat alone on Beigaofeng Mountain, repeatedly thinking about why "poets and writers" must inscribe the sentence "I was here." But I couldn't find a proper answer. It wasn't until I opened Journey to the West that I saw the passage where Sun Wukong somersaulted in the palm of the Buddha, and I suddenly understood. The original text of this passage is...</p>
<p>......That Great Sage put away the Ruyi stick, gathered his spirits, jumped up, landed in the palm of the Buddha, and said, "I'm going!" You see him all the way Yun Guang, no shadow disappeared, ......When the Great Sage was walking, he suddenly saw five red meat pillars, supporting a green breath, he said, "This is the end of the road..." He thought again, "Wait, let me leave some marks, so that I can talk to the Buddha." He pulled out a hair, turned it into a thick ink double-haired pen, and wrote a line of big characters in the middle pillar: "The Great Sage Equal to Heaven was here," ......He sprinkled a pool of urine under the first pillar, ......</p>
<p>Oh, we know that monkeys are the ancestors of human beings. Now, although human beings are said to have evolved, a small number of people have not completely shed their "true colors." However, Sun Wukong's way of playing is indeed different; in addition to "I was here," he also has to sprinkle a pool of urine. Modern "poets" can only inscribe sentences, but they cannot urinate. No, this doesn't seem to be a question of whether they can or cannot urinate. Just imagine, they have "poems" in their stomachs, and they can write them everywhere, so they don't feel any effort. However, if they were asked to sprinkle a pool of urine everywhere they went, it would be like a punishment. Cao Zhi can compose a poem in seven steps, but no one dares to guarantee that he can urinate in seven steps. From this, it can be seen that the difficulty of urinating is more precious than composing a poem. Because, although everyone can urinate, it is not allowed to urinate at any time. And poems, whether they are fart poems or **** poems, can be written anytime and anywhere. (If urine is "rushed" out because they can't make a poem, it is of course different from "sprinkling" and cannot be regarded as a poet, but can only be regarded as an exception.) So I think that modern "poets" only inscribe sentences and do not urinate, which is a question of whether their urine "supply" and "demand" are offset. If it is said that "poets" only have the trick of "I was here" and cannot urinate, then it is underestimating "poets."</p>
<p>The earth quietly sends through a wave of intoxicating fragrance, the light laughter of the girls!</p>
<p>Small rivers, small bridges, artificial like mountains, pedestrian roads full of pine and cypress. Children clap their hands, gathering past under the feet of adults, every chair, full of partners waiting for the evening breeze; male partners look at female partners, the cool wind, in the heart of every partner, is so sweet, so cool!</p>
<p>The newspaper reading place, bumping heads, black, large, and small words, jumping under the yellow lights; the entertainment place, the vibration of the silk strings of the erhu, the window, crowded with such a large group of people; the Confucian ceremonial vessel exhibition place, the door, deeply tightly making a nostalgic dream; the public education hall, black hiding in the corner, shining at the terrifying illusion of the night; the bright lights of selling ice and soda, reflecting the yellow, white orange juice, soda bottles, white tablecloths, thin milky yellow wax tubes, young masters and young ladies, lowering their heads and drinking that fragrant, cool drink.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Hongkou Bathhouse</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>In this scorching summer, everyone will go to the cool Hongkou bathhouse without prior consultation.</p>
<p>Here are men and women from all over the world? There are Japanese, Western, American...... In short, this is an exhibition of the beauty of curves and the beauty of health in the world!</p>
<p>A fashionable woman in fashionable clothes sits on a wooden bench, watching her lover's swimming posture.</p>
<p>White Russian women protruding their unique breasts, shouting sharp cheers, grabbing the leather ball floating on the water.</p>
<p>Children chasing and running, carelessly, plop sliding into the pool, surrounded by a burst of laughter!</p>
<p>A Western couple, sleeping in a corner of the grass, the man touching the woman's thigh, the woman giggling!</p>
<p>Japanese men and women swimming vigorously, fully demonstrating the island nation's stunts!</p>
<p>Several women, draped in towels, standing shyly by the pool, have never seen them go into the water, or they have other functions!</p>
<p>Several old country men who came out of Jiangwan stood outside the fence, sighing</p>
<h3>Summer Nights in New Land</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Taking the night train from Qingning City, after passing one small station and continuing east for no more than twenty minutes, one arrives at Xinlu Station, which exists because of the Xinlu Normal School located there. That night, we stayed in the school building.</p>
<p>Stepping off the train, walking back a hundred or so steps, and turning left, one finds a rather long and wide stone path already bathed in moonlight. This path leads directly to the school building; the shadows of the trees on both sides appear denser and shorter the farther one looks, and they seem to connect to each other. The wind blows gently, the tree shadows rustle softly, and the cicadas sing in unison, mixed with the chirping of various summer insects, creating a tranquil atmosphere. At the same time, a fragrance similar to that after rain, so cool, assaults the nose, making one feel indescribably happy. Here, there is no summer's threat, but summer's beauty!</p>
<p>Everyone is silent, watching the shadows of the people ahead move flickeringly, white silk shirts flying in the moonlight, the tiger-head shoes treading on the shallow sand, emitting a low murmur; I take off my white felt hat, hang it on a pine branch, and ecstatically experience this moment of lingering emotion, yet there is no poetry.</p>
<p>Passing through a palm grove, the stiff leaves clapping in symphony, at this time, the color green is full of dynamic vitality, like the scene of spying on squirrels in an orchard in South Africa. Suddenly, a shout in front startled me. Later, I learned that Miss Tang, absorbed in the night scenery, looking up at the sky, had mistakenly stepped into a pit in the road, causing her to cry out in surprise. After dinner, everyone took a bath, then walked barefoot, dragging straw sandals, to find benches under the dense trees of the large garden. There were seven people in total, each seeking their own peaceful resting place, dispersing in unknown directions. There was no one else in the garden, only serenity, quietness, tranquility, and laziness. Occupying the entire garden were almost no longer us, but the wind, the trees, and the summer insects.</p>
<p>I imagine that everyone is lying horizontally on a chair, just like me, raising their eyes, looking at the sky through the gaps in the leaves, the moon and clouds in the sky, and the patterns within the clouds; otherwise, why is there not a single sound? Correctly, I only feel joy, but I don't want to know that this is joy, and I absolutely don't know that I am feeling joy; what more can I say?</p>
<p>If there really is a moment of stillness in the world, in my experience, this moment is the most real. Of course, there are cicadas chirping in the trees, insects chirping in the grass, and wind rustling through all the flowers and leaves; but I didn't hear it, didn't think about it.</p>
<p>Breaking this "selfless" dream is the sound of a lullaby flying from afar, sung by Miss Zou; then, from the south, a sharp voice joins in harmony. I don't know who it is, but from the north, the same song begins, and then, from all directions, everyone joins in, mixing the harmony of the high and middle voices of Western opera, but softly, slowly, gracefully. It still feels quiet, and it evokes childhood memories. I am not in the garden of Xinlu, but in my mother's warm embrace!</p>
<p>Soon, the singing gradually fades away, becoming inaudible.</p>
<h3>Appreciating Lotuses at Summer Green Pond</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The best place to escape the summer heat is, of course, deep in the green mountains, among towering ancient trees; or a ten-acre pond filled with lotus blossoms covering the water's surface. Does Shanghai have such a good place? Everyone dares to say with certainty: no! no! Not to mention green mountains, there isn't even a tall mound of earth. On the streets, there are only giant buildings of a dozen or so stories, standing like giants. At night, they emit thousands of gaudy red lights, containing a hundred kinds of bustling activity, which only dazzle the eyes and bewilder the mind. How can one talk about escaping the summer heat there? Speaking of water, although there are the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek, lying like giant snakes, the yellow and turbid water, the foul smell, and the several murderous ironclad warships lying on top, sailing commercial ships and wooden boats loaded with people and goods. What sunset fishing, what wild ferry crossing, what fisherman's song; this kind of eighteenth-century poetic realm is no longer worthy of being placed in the progressive and modern city of Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Looking at plums can quench thirst, and consoling oneself is better than nothing.] Shanghai still has a few man-made miniature landscapes. Bansong Garden and Fanwangdu Garden have long been known to everyone. Even the artificial mountain in the back garden of the City God Temple, and the stinking water in front of the Huxinting Teahouse, which looks like a sewer, who dares to deny that they are not landscapes? Besides the above-mentioned places, I have recently discovered a private garden. Several acres of lotus ponds, overflowing with fragrance, are truly an excellent place to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>This garden is located at the northern end of Baziqiao Bridge in Zhabei, owned by Mr. Chen from Guangdong. It occupies dozens of acres, and besides the necessary decorations, the lotus pond occupies one-third of the area. This year, the garden owner issued garden passes, inviting people to appreciate the lotuses. I was fortunate enough to get one, and I invited several friends to go to that place. A low surrounding wall, inlaid with two iron gates, is inscribed with the five characters [Chen Family Cultivation Garden]. After ringing the doorbell, the gardener asked a question, and peeked through the crack in the door. Seeing that we were tourists, he opened the garden gate listlessly, letting us in. His attitude of valuing quietness during the day made one feel uncertain whether to advance or retreat. [Ten knocks on the thatched door, and nine times it remains unopened.] This gardener can be said to be reciting poetry, but you have failed your master's good intentions!</p>
<p>Entering the gate, there is a large lawn, surrounded by large trees, and planted with some flowers. Sitting here in the evening is quite nice. At the northern end of the lawn, there is a three-bay bungalow, with two stone lions squatting in front of the door, giving off a majestic air. Going further in, the scenery gradually improves. There is a hexagonal bamboo pavilion, completely surrounded by wisteria, with a stone table and stone benches in the middle, which is quite antique. Beyond that is the lotus pond, with a lakeside pavilion, a winding bridge, and artificial mountains beside it. We chose a waterside pavilion to sit in. The pavilion is surrounded by water on three sides, and on the land side, it is planted with many green bamboos, which is really high, spacious, and cool. Looking at the pond, the lotus leaves are spread out like thousands of green silk umbrellas; the white lotus flowers are truly like fairies standing quietly on the waves; the elegant fragrance is refreshing, blowing in gusts with the wind, truly making one's thirty-six thousand pores feel refreshed. There are also many small fish in the pond, playing under the lotus leaves, making soft sounds. In this kind of realm, one is reminded of the Buddha's tranquility and love of lotuses. In the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss, the seven-treasure ponds are of course filled with lotus flowers and lotus leaves. Are we not also in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss sitting here today? At this moment, two young men in Western suits came from outside. They looked at the lotus pond for a while, and one said: "It's a pity that such a large lotus pond doesn't have a lotus-picking beauty. Wouldn't it be interesting if Sweet Sister Jian Lili were to pick lotuses here barefoot and with her legs exposed!" Another continued: "What's so good about lotus flowers? If the house were torn down and turned into a swimming pool, it would be bigger than the one in Hongkou!" Hearing their words, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the lotus flowers. In the modern era, only plump and fleshy legs continue to attract love and play, who will love the quiet green lotuses?</p>
<p>This crossing to the [shore of stillness] is extremely natural and extremely hazy. The world returns to the [selfless] dream, the moonlight embraces my body, and I am sleeping in the cradle of nature. In this way, the summer night blows a sky full of spring breeze.</p>
<h3>The Confucian Temple in the Cool Night</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>It is a sacred place for night tours in the southern city, a strolling garden to dispel the loneliness of life.</p>
<p>Eastern, classical stone pillars stand in front of the [archway]. The wind, from the silk sleeves of the men, blows to the small dimples beside the women's mouths.</p>
<p>The lamplight scatters from milky white spheres in this palace of cool summer evenings. The classical-style upturned corners of the pavilions, the ocher-yellow high walls, the red bases of the pillars, and the red labels vaguely reflect the silver and blue flower patterns on the ceiling.</p>
<p>The summer night breeze, from the tip of every man's nose and chest, blows upon the swaying waists of every girl. From every branch of the man-made stream, it blows upon that small patch of grass; the wind, the light and cool night breeze, from under the rose and grape trellises, the wind, the fragrant breeze of powder and rouge; from beside the lamp post and juniper trees, a secluded place for men and women to bathe together, a declining society!</p>
<p>Several young men who can't afford tickets look into the women's breasts, trying to squeeze their heads through small holes!</p>
<h3>Half-Day Trip to Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>The people of Wuxi, who are constantly shrouded in coal fumes, are truly unfortunate this year. Since the beginning of summer, the temperature has always been above ninety degrees. The fiery sun hangs high, scorching people. Not to mention the workers toiling beside the machines, even we so-called gentlemen sitting in air-conditioned offices are still sweating profusely, as if suffocating in a hot steamer.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the thermometer had risen to ninety-nine and a half degrees. All the plants were withering under the fierce power of the scorching sun, and even stray dogs were stretching out their tongues, panting incessantly. I was sitting neither sitting nor standing, feeling so hot that I was at my wit's end when suddenly I heard [Pa!</p>
<p>Pa!] two sounds by the river outside the door. I hurriedly went to the door to take a look. It turned out that several friends had hired a motorboat to invite me to swim in Taihu Lake. I was immediately overjoyed, returned to the bedroom to change into my swimming suit, as if I had forgotten the sweltering heat just now, and brought soft drinks, towels, and other necessary items. Together with my friends, I boarded the boat. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon, and the motorboat roared [Pa Pa] twice under the scorching sun and bravely set off towards Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>[Let's go down here and play for a while!] Mr. Tong Shubei, who is good at swimming, suggested to everyone. I was the first to second the proposal. Then, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Chen, and Miss Li all agreed. So everyone took off their outer clothes, leaving only the one-piece swimsuit, and bravely moved towards the water.</p>
<p>Miss Li was learning to swim, holding a wooden board, practicing in the shallow water, with Mr. Tong teaching her by the side. Mr. Zhang, Mr. Chen, and I all temporarily played the roles of fish and shrimp, floating on the deeper lake surface. Except for half of our heads, our whole bodies were lightly submerged in the cool, shady, and green lake water. Everyone's consciousness forgot the heat of summer.</p>
<p>Miss Li, seeing us swimming so eagerly, also tried to go to a deeper place. She threw away the wooden board and vigorously moved her limbs. Who knew that her technique was not skilled enough, and the lake water immediately submerged her. Seeing that the situation was not good, Mr. Tong shouted loudly [Everyone come!], and immediately plunged into the water. Fortunately, we had not yet swum to where she was before, and the brave Mr. Tong had already rescued Miss Li from the bottom of the water. The companions who had not joined in the swimming and were watching on the shore all shouted in unison [How dangerous!].</p>
<p>Everyone returned to the shore, but Miss Li was not injured at all. She was only forced to drink a few mouthfuls of the merciless water. Although she said [The power of water is truly great, it can make people lose their autonomy,], she still did not show any timidity, and her spirit was still very good. She even prepared to practice at Yuantouzhu, which shows that Miss Li has some courage and perseverance, and everyone admires her very much.</p>
<p>At this time, it was only four ten, and everyone lined up to return to the boat and set off again towards Yuantouzhu.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Yuantouzhu, we swam below [Hengyun]. The lake water was shallower than at Lihu Garden, but the water was not very clear, and the bottom of the lake was full of jagged rocks. Those who were not good at swimming were very likely to hurt their hands or feet. Miss Li was afraid of hurting her delicate skin, so she held on tightly to the wooden board and refused to let go. A playful Mr. Zhang saw her from more than a dozen feet away on the water's surface and shouted [Ah! Wooden board! Wooden board! You are truly blessed!]. Mr. Zhang shouted in the water with a wild laugh [Yes, here, the wooden board is my only lover!], Miss Li said innocently, hugging the wooden board even tighter. Mr. Zhang suddenly shouted again [I am willing to be this wooden board!]. Everyone laughed, and Miss Li then slightly shyly scolded him [Bah, you bad egg]. Mr. Tong and I re-entered the water, intending to swim to our heart's content before going back. The four of us decided to have a war in the water. Mr. Tong was the most skilled swimmer, and he was on one side alone, while Mr. Zhang, Mr. Chen, and I joined forces to attack him. The winner or loser was determined by who swallowed water first. Whoever was first pressed into the water and swallowed a mouthful would be considered the loser.</p>
<p>At half past five, everyone packed up together to return to the boat. The light and heat of the scorching sun gradually weakened, and the evening wind from the lake kept blowing into the cabin. Everyone felt very cool. The motorboat advanced rapidly on the way back. Everyone had enjoyed a half-day of nature's bounty in this vast Taihu Lake and felt somewhat tired. Everyone slept or sat in the cabin very happily. At six forty-five, we returned home. This half-day of the scorching summer was finally secretly escaped.</p>

<h3>The Beiping Research Institute Continues to Offer General Scholarships for Geology and Mineral Products</h3>
<p>The National Beiping Research Institute has established research scholarships for geology and mineral products. The scholarship review committee has been organized in the past, and six rules and a scholarship application form have been established. Qualified papers for this item have been reviewed over the years, and scholarships have been awarded separately. Currently, the special scholarship item has been temporarily suspended, and the general scholarship continues to be offered. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the rules, students in their third and fourth years of undergraduate study at universities (or those with equivalent academic qualifications) or university graduates who have preliminary research achievements in geology, mineralogy, paleontology, mining, and metallurgy are eligible for general scholarships.

<h3>Dong Kang and Others' Opinions on Raising Funds to Print the Complete Library in Four Sections</h3>
<p>▲ If There Are Other Versions That Can Be Substituted, Those Versions Should Be Used</p>
<p>▲ The Name, Scope, and Content of Unpublished Versions Should Be Reconsidered</p>
<p>Regarding the Central Library's fundraising to print the unpublished versions of the Complete Library in Four Sections, Cai Yuanpei and Yuan Tongli of the Beiping Library previously submitted a written statement to the Ministry of Education, which was recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that this matter has aroused serious attention from scholars in the north and south. The other day, Dong Kang, Fu Zengxiang, Ye Gongchao, and others jointly wrote to the education authorities, making further suggestions. The suggestion letter is excerpted below:</p>
<p>To Minister Xueting,</p>
<p>Recent newspapers have widely reported the proposal to raise funds to print the unpublished versions of the Complete Library in Four Sections, and that the work will begin soon. We admire your promotion of culture and support for academic research. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved solely by the will of one or two people. There are two things that we dare not remain silent about. We respectfully present our limited views to you, hoping they may be of some help. Please examine them carefully.</p>
<h3>Use Other Versions</h3>
<p>1.  Other versions should be used to replace versions in the Four Sections library where applicable. During the compilation of the Four Sections, the compilers arbitrarily revised works. Some were deemed to have indecent content, such as the deletion of the essay in Zhou Nan Shan Fang Ji, and the removal of the "Casting Two Essays" from Zhou Fulizhai Qian Dao Pian. Some were considered to have too many taboos in their writing, such as Huang Zongyi's Ming Wen Hai. Many of the Ming dynasty's works on resisting and defending against foreign invaders were heavily censored. A comparison with the original drafts reveals the clear pattern. Furthermore, there are countless essential words and phrases in the collections of prose and memorials from the Song and Yuan dynasties that were lost in the Library version. The increase in the number of volumes, the reversal of order, and the deletion and modification of prefaces and tables of contents are even more numerous. Some were included based on fragmentary editions, while the original books still exist in the world. Some were included based on compiled editions, while the compilation was not truly complete. Scholars of bibliography can discuss all of these issues. For the current selection of prints, it seems that opinions should first be widely solicited from private and public collectors at home and abroad, as well as from specialized experts. Strict decisions should be made on what to include and what to exclude. All books that have no other available version should be compiled into Part A to distinguish them from other books. As for other books, although there are no modern reprints, old Song, Yuan, or Ming editions or old manuscripts exist that are a hundred times better than the Library version, or are the very source from which the Library version was derived. These should be compiled into Part B, which will complement and support Part A. The two parts, A and B, are tentatively named "Treasures of the Complete Library" (or another name can be used instead), and the purpose of editing and reforming should be explained in detail in the general principles to inform the world. In this way, both difficulties will be resolved. Reading books in Part B, which are not Library versions, may seem to make printing them together with Part A, to achieve uniformity, unnecessary. In reality, the books in Part A, which all use the Library version, already have little value. Now, with Part B to supplement them, the books in Part A will be enhanced, and scholars at home and abroad will certainly celebrate. Let the world know the process of the Ministry's fundraising for this project is not something that can be done carelessly. Wouldn't that be great? If it is said that collecting books for Part B is not easy, and that it is difficult to find rare books, this is also an overestimation. The study of Chinese editions and bibliographies is at its peak today. There is no shortage of experts in this field at home, and there are those who are following suit abroad. The tasks of investigation and compilation can be entrusted to specialized experts, or to public and private libraries famous for collecting old and rare books, and to the Central Library to jointly handle them. If a time limit is set, the matter will surely be accomplished. The success or failure depends on this one action. This is the first thing we wish to tell you.</p>
<h3>Reconsider</h3>
<p>1.  The name, scope, and content of the unpublished editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections should be reconsidered. It is found that a large number of books in the Complete Library are recorded based on drafts, that is, those compiled from Yongle Encyclopedia or recorded from manuscripts. At that time, there were mostly published editions or things engraved edition. It has been a long time since the world has seen the disappearance. Therefore, if the selected prints are collectively named unpublished, it seems that it is not appropriate. It is better to use the rare editions compiled by the Beiping Library recently, and it is more logical to be named after the rare Fu. If the so-called unpublished cloud is a narrow sense rather than a broad sense, then up to what generation will the unpublished in a narrow sense be cut off, saying that it will be cut off before the Ming Dynasty, then how to solve the recent compilation of the Central Library, there are also Ming people's writings, saying that it is cut off before the Ming and Qing Dynasties, although the book was published in the Ming Dynasty, but the rare in Fu Shi is no less than the old engraved of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, such as the Northern River crime Yunnan strategy and other books, why should all of them be included, and the writings of the Song and Yuan Dynasties collected in the central museum, such as the Shi Gu Analects and the Answers to the Analects in the Sutra Department, the Taiping Governance Statistics of the Four Books, the History of the History Department, the Taiping Governance Statistics, the Taijin Deyun Tushen, and the Zizheng Essentials in the Yu Department of the Aobo Figure, and the collections of Tiao Xi Jishunfang Jishanfang, etc., all have separate editions or series books after the same Yuan, why not all listed, it seems that this contradiction is difficult to solve, it seems that it is appropriate to immediately invite general scholars to consider it from a long-term perspective, otherwise it will only make outsiders cold, this is the second thing to tell Mr. This, the above-mentioned are all urgent tasks of the moment, I hope that gentlemen, etc., based on the ultimate meaning of academic public instruments, adopt the requests of the foolish people, and strive to complete it together, so that it can be achieved, and the future of culture is really relied on, and the districts are respectfully announced, and I hope to appreciate and understand, and hereby wish Dao Qi, Dong Kang, Fu Zengxiang, Ye Gongchao, Zhu Qiqian, Jiang Han, Shen Shiyuan, Zhu Xizhu, Li Shengduo, Shen Jianshi, Chen Yuan, Zhang Yunliang, Xu Hongbao, Ma Lian, Mao Guangsheng, Ma Heng, Xu Naichang, Zhang Zhiming, Gu Xiegeng, Gu Jiegang, Liu Fu, Tang Zhong, Chen Yinke, Tao Xiang, Zhao Zunyu, Liu Chengan Tong Qi,</p>

<h3>Sports</h3>
<h3>Inter-Port Tennis Tournament</h3>
<h3>Tianjin Suffers a Crushing Defeat, Shanghai Wins the Tilden Cup</h3>
<p>｜Shanghai Wins Three Matches Consecutively on the Second Day｜</p>
<p>▲ Lao Qiu and Xiao Zheng Both Win, Liang-Shi Doubles Also Triumphs</p>
<p>▲ The Last Two Matches Today Are Irrelevant to the Championship</p>
<p>The result of the second day of the Shanghai-Tianjin Inter-Port Tennis Tournament has already decided the championship. Shanghai won three matches consecutively, winning the Tilden Silver Cup. Zheng Zhaojia defeated Dalun Qiang three to one, Qiu Feihai defeated Jie Hansheng three to zero, and the Liang-Shi doubles team defeated Fubohui three to one. Tianjin suffered a crushing defeat, which is very regrettable. Their tennis skills are mediocre and not a match for Shanghai. There are still two final matches starting at 3:00 PM today, but they are irrelevant to the championship.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Zhaojia First Defeats Dalun Qiang</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia's singles match against Dalun Qiang continued yesterday. Zheng Zhaojia won the fourth set, winning three to one.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia (Shanghai) 2-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 Dalun Qiang (Tianjin)</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia's singles match against Lunqiang was ahead by two to one the day before, but was stopped due to the late hour. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the two continued the match. At the beginning, Zheng was quite unfavorable, making many unforced errors. He lost the fourth game by a score of one to three. After winning the fifth game, he lost the sixth game again, making it two to four. From then on, Zheng played cautiously, using left and right diagonal attacks to avoid unforced errors. The momentum greatly changed. Lunqiang was unable to keep up and was at a loss. Zheng then won four games in a row and won six to four. The overall result was three to one, Zheng won. The scores were two to six, six to three, six to one, six to four. (Singles) Zheng Zhaojia, who defeated Lun Qiang in the Tianjin-Shanghai Inter-Port Tennis Tournament, center is Jie Hansheng (Tianjin), and left is Qiu Feihai (Shanghai).</p>

<p>▲ Qiu Feihai Sweeps Jie Hansheng</p>
<p>The battle between Qiu Feihai and Jie Hansheng, Tianjin's first singles player, followed. Although Jie Hansheng is a good player in Tianjin, he was no match for Lao Qiu. Under Lao Qiu's left and right swings, he was defeated by three to zero, with not a single point left. It can be said to be miserable. At this point, Shanghai had won two matches and needed one more to win the championship.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (Shanghai) 6-0, 6-0, 6-0 Jie Hansheng (Tianjin)</p>
<p>▲ Qiu Feihai Three Six-Zeroes Qiu served first, and Jie Hansheng responded. Then he rushed to the net and intercepted a kill, taking the first point. With this momentum, he did not expect to be completely defeated later. Qiu did not panic and began his left and right corner shots, winning four points in a row and taking the first game. Jie served and still wanted to go to the net, but Qiu's deep baseline shots left Jie helpless. Qiu won again, game after game. When it was five to zero, his shots were fierce and powerful. The first set was six to zero. At the beginning of the second set, Jie tried to resist. After being equal, Qiu took the lead, and Jie suppressed a high ball from Qiu, and it seemed that the crisis could be saved. However, the second set was also six to zero. In the third set, Qiu's serve went deep into the corner, taking the first game. In the fourth game, Jie was at the net, and Lao Qiu performed a sideline shot, and the audience applauded. As a result, Jie Hansheng was not given a single game or a breath, and won eighteen games in a row. It can be said to be heroic.</p>
<p>▲ Jie Hansheng Had No Way Out</p>
<p>Jie Hansheng is a famous football player with the power of Li Huitang. Therefore, he is good at running. What he can still deal with Lao Qiu is his fast footwork and saving the ball many times. The ball is still powerful, but there is no certainty in the attack. Among the points lost, the ones that failed due to going out of bounds cannot be recorded, and hitting the net is also frequent. Only the net interception is good. Under Qiu's fierce attack, there is no way out, only seeing the exhaustion of his skills and being busy dealing with it. His tennis skills are only third-rate.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Doubles Team Also Wins</p>
<p>In the first match, the Shanghai Liang-Shi doubles team won over Hui's and Jiaobo, allowing the Shanghai team to win the championship and win all three matches. Today's match is irrelevant to the outcome.</p>
<p>Liang-Shi (Shanghai) 6-3, 7-9, 7-5, 7-5 Hui's, Fubohui (Tianjin)</p>
<p>▲ Dull Situation The last doubles match was the most boring, because both sides sent points through suicide, causing many wins to turn into defeats, especially on the Shanghai side. There were often situations where the score was 40-0, but the outcome was a loss. In the second set, Shanghai was already ahead by five to four, and the tenth game was 40-0, but the result was a loss, making it five to five. After Tianjin got six to five, Shanghai won two games in a row, exceeding seven to six, but the game that could be won with forty to zero returned to Tianjin, failing to seven to nine, which is strange. In the first set, Tianjin got three to two, and Shanghai won four games in a row, winning six to three. The third and fourth sets were the same. In the third set, Tianjin got the lead of four to two, and Shanghai won three games, exceeding five to four, but the serve game failed, making it five to five. In the next game, Hui's serve was broken, and he got his next serve again, winning seven to five. The fourth set was the same, without any difference, which is also strange.</p>
<p>▲ Mediocre Skills The skills of both sides can be said to be comparable. Shanghai has a slight advantage. If they have a little more confidence, they should win by a large margin. The skills are below Yu Tianguang's generation. Among the two Shis, there are both merits and demerits. Liang Stok is more stable, and his suppression is very effective. Liang Guiya has some serves, with many mistakes, and some points. When pressing the ball in front of the baseline, countless balls are sent into the net. Tianjin's Hui is good at hitting the net, but his serve is weak, and his serve game sends away dozens of seven or eight. Fu Bo is better and can still be seen. ▲ The Last Two Games Today</p>
<p>The last two games today are no longer relevant to the championship. The order is as follows: ㈠ Singles Machida (Shanghai) vs. Fubu (Tianjin) 3:00 PM ㈡ Doubles Qiu Feihai Zheng Zhaojia (Shanghai) vs. Jie Hansheng Dalun Qiang (Tianjin) 4:30 PM There is a proposal to change Zheng Zhaojia to Jiang Daozhang.</p>

<h3>Sino-U.S.-Japan Swimming Competition</h3>
<p>▲ To Be Held on the 19th of This Month</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Team Meeting This Morning</p>
<p>The second Sino-U.S.-Japan Swimming Competition was held the day before yesterday by Topin, the sports director of the Xiqiao YMCA, who convened Chinese representative Yu Binqi and Japanese representative Kawakatsu for a meeting on the third floor of Xiqing. First, Mr. Topin reported on the accounts of the first competition. The ticket sales totaled 183 yuan, and the expenses for medals and printed matter were 117 yuan and 3 cents. Although there was a deposit of 65 yuan and 97 cents, the expenses for the swimming pool were not included. For this year's competition, it is planned to reduce the prizes. Mr. Yu objected, saying that Chinese swimming is still in its early stages, and it is necessary to encourage swimming personnel with prizes to increase interest. In terms of prizes, Mr. Ma, a friend, has been obtained to donate a Fumin Silver Cup to be competed for in this competition. The winner can keep this cup for one year, and those who win three times in a row can keep it permanently. Gold, silver, and bronze medals for the first, second, and third places in each event do not need to be expensive. Now the Standard Sports Equipment Company is willing to donate them all, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce President and Chinese Swimming Research Association President Wang Xiaolai will donate a large silver shield to the champion team of this competition. The U.S. and Japanese representatives all approved and passed the resolution.</p>
<p>▲ Other Matters The competition date is set for 8:30 PM on the 19th of this month at the Westerner YMCA swimming pool. Shen Siliang is invited to be the chief referee, and Topin is the starter and reporter. Each country will have one other staff member. The number of participants is limited to four per country for relays and diving, and two per country for the remaining events. The first, second, third, and fourth places will be taken in each event, with 5, 3, 2, and 1 points respectively. Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and half a yuan. (The text of the submission is confusing and unclear.)</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Candidates A preliminary selection was held in Lanyuan on the 11th. The weather was not beautiful, with intermittent rain and sunshine, so it could not be perfect. Fortunately, the spirit was still healthy and could be completed. Li Rongyao, Yin Yanjun, and Zhu Jiongpei, three gentlemen who are famous for freestyle distance, were unable to participate in the preliminary selection due to circumstances, but they have been strictly trained and have made rapid progress compared to before. They are willing to serve as representatives. There are surprisingly few talents in the backstroke event. Ling Chongju, a strong player, died of appendicitis. Yu Binqi did not participate in the preliminary competition this time due to planning the preliminary selection. The diving preliminary competition was not held due to time constraints. It is now planned to select two or three people from Zhu Zhicheng, Hu Qijie, Li Mingyang, Huo Zhenghong, and Xiang Bingqiu to participate.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Today In order to prepare for the Sino-Japanese-American competition, a meeting will be held at 9:00 AM this morning at the Chinese National Sports Association on Rue Pére Robert to arrange for intensive training. All male winners, as well as Li Rongyao, Yin Yanjun, Yu Binqi, Zhu Jiongpei, Wang Jianxin, Hong Zunsan, diving Hu Qijie, etc., as well as those who are confident in their good results and want to try their results, are requested to attend on time, and the Chinese team will be formally organized. In addition, the first place winner of each preliminary competition will be awarded a swimsuit by the Fumin Woolen Mill. Each winner should quickly notify Yu Binqi of their own size in order to customize it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Swimmer Makino Again Sets 400m World Record</h3>
<p>▲ Four Minutes, Forty-Seven and Six Tenths Seconds</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 12th) The All-Japan Aquatic Championships, also the preliminary competition for the 10th Far Eastern Games, gathered the national elite. Today, at the Meiji Jingu Outer Garden, Waseda University's Shozo Makino, who set the world record for 800m the day before, set an amazing record of four minutes, forty-seven and six-tenths seconds in the 400m freestyle swimming, breaking the world record of four minutes, forty-eight and four-tenths seconds set by the United States.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Ball Games Do Not Participate in the National Games</h3>
<p>(Qingdao, 12th Dispatch) The Sports Commission held a meeting today and decided to only send athletes for track and field, swimming, and national martial arts to participate in the National Games. Ball games will not participate. The standard is to review those who have participated in the North China Games and whose scores exceed the third place.</p>
<h3>The Xiantang Cup Tennis League Green Light Wins Over China by Eight to Seven</h3>
<p>▲ There Are Five More Matches Today</p>
<p>The Xiantang Cup Tennis League, which has been going on for a month, has been fighting back and forth. The scores of each team are gradually becoming apparent. The Railway and Yoyo teams are the most likely to win the championship, followed by the Green Light and other teams, who still need to make final efforts. There are six more matches today. The most interesting one is the sister battle between Yoyo and Yoyi. Chenguang lost to Kong. Because the members of the Donghua team were ill, the game was postponed. The order is as follows:</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Kick</h3>
<p>---Yu of Feng</p>
<p>Two months ago, I talked about [push], but this time I'm talking about [kick] again. The [Shen Bao] on the ninth of this month reported that on the evening of the sixth, three varnishers, Liu Mingshan, Yang Akun, and Gu Hongsheng, were enjoying the cool at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Several other people were gambling nearby, and a patrol officer came forward to drive them away. Liu and Gu were actually kicked into the water by a Russian policeman, and Liu Mingshan drowned. According to the Russian policeman, it was naturally [accidentally falling into the water]. But according to Gu Hongsheng, he said... [Liu, Yang, and I went to Taikoo Wharf to enjoy the cool. Liu was sitting on the floor under the iron bench... I was standing next to him... The Russian policeman came and kicked Liu first. Liu had already stood up to avoid it, but he was kicked again, causing him to fall into the river. I wanted to pull him up, but it was too late, so I turned around and grabbed the Russian policeman, but he pushed me away with his hand, and I also fell into the river and was rescued]. The judge asked... [Why did you kick him?]. He replied... [I don't know].</p>
<p>[Pushing] requires raising a hand. It is not worth the trouble to deal with lower-class people, so there is [kick]. And Shanghai really has experts in [kicking], there are Indian patrol officers, there are Annamite patrol officers, and now there are also White Russian patrol officers. They are applying the methods used by the Tsarist era against Jews to us. We are really a people who are good at [enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens]. As long as we don't [fall into the river], we generally use a humorous saying to say... [I ate a foreign ham], and laugh it off.</p>
<p>After the Miao people were defeated, they all ran into the mountains. This is because our first emperor, Xuanyuan, drove them away. After the remnants of the Southern Song Dynasty were defeated, they ran to the seaside. It is said that our first emperor, Genghis Khan, also drove them away. In the end, Lu Xiufu carried the young emperor and jumped into the sea. We Chinese people were originally destined to [accidentally fall into the water]. Some generous people say that only water and air in the world are given to the poor. This statement is actually inaccurate. In reality, the poor can get the same water and air as everyone else. Even if you just enjoy the cool on the dock, you may be [kicked] for no reason and lose your life...falling into the river. If you want to save a friend, or grab the murderer, [you will also be pushed away with a hand]...and also fall into the river.</p>
<p>Times are progressing, ships and airplanes are everywhere. If the last emperor of the Southern Song Dynasty were born today, he would never have fallen into the sea. He could have run to a foreign country, while the common people replaced him by [falling into the river]. Although this reason is simple, it is complicated. Therefore, Gu Hongsheng, a varnisher, said... [I don't know].</p>
<h3>[Vandals] Doing</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Henry George said: "Not in the desert becoming a forest, but in the slums and on the roads of the metropolis, a group of barbarians arise, who will do in modern civilization what the Huns and Vandals did in ancient times."</p>
<p>The "Huns" are well known to us, as for the "Vandals", they are found in Western history, one of the ancient Germanic tribes, who established a kingdom in Africa in the fifth century. It is said that in the year 455 AD, they captured Rome, and during their two-week occupation, they wreaked havoc, leaving no literary or scientific buildings. They got their name from this. To this day, the Western dictionaries retain their name, Vandale, but interpreted as "destroyers of literary and scientific buildings," and under their name is added -ism, becoming a specific term for the act of destroying art. In fact, the Vandals were thorough destroyers of the old.</p>
<p>Following Henry George, Tolstoy said: "The Vandals are already prepared in Russia. And among our deeply religious people, they will be especially terrible, because we do not understand these control methods... that is, the etiquette and public opinion that are extremely developed among the European people."</p>
<p>The Vandals that Tolstoy spoke of did indeed occupy Russia for a long time, and at first, they did indeed wreak havoc on the so-called "modern civilization." However, after thorough destruction, they built a civilization higher than modern civilization on a new foundation.</p>
<p>China's Vandals are naturally also preparing. However, because China is the China of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, the degree of development of etiquette and public opinion not only makes our people unattainable, but even the Europeans mentioned by Tolstoy are far behind. Therefore, the Chinese control skills are particularly brilliant, and we can know the effect of these control skills by observing the assimilation of foreign tribes and the elimination of reactionaries throughout the dynasties.</p>
<p>But the Vandals are actually wronged. Because the destruction of literature, science and even art was not their specialty at first. The bombing of the Commercial Press last year and the burning of the Sex Science Library this year are actually the work of modern civilized people in the East and the West.</p>
<h3>About Translation</h3>
<p>— Dasheng</p>
<p>A few days ago, a gentleman talked about "translation" and "compilation," saying: "I heard that there are many translators now who don't even bother to look at the original work from beginning to end, and start translating from the first line. There is no way to talk about understanding the original work." He also said: "Obviously, we still lack scholars who can conduct in-depth and painstaking research on a certain theory and apply it freely." I absolutely agree with this statement. In fact, most of the translated works in our current publishing industry are so bad that people dare not accept them. No matter what kind of translated work it is, after reading three or four pages, it is often "incomprehensible." What jumps into the eyes from the book is only one word after another. If you forcibly connect them into a sentence, it is neither Chinese nor foreign. The more you read, the less you understand. The more you read, the less sense it makes. Of course, when readers can't understand, they can only complain that Gorky's writing is not good, just like a bookstore owner did after reading the Chinese translation of Gorky's work for forty years, and blame the original author for a muddled account.</p>
<p>I have always adhered to the "Monroe Doctrine" for these incomprehensible and irrelevant translated works, not only not buying them, but also not reading them. However, whenever I find a famous work being translated into something incomprehensible, an inexplicable anger can't help but rise from my heart. I feel that wantonly ruining other people's good works is an unforgivable sin in any way.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, it is not surprising that there is such a bad phenomenon in the translation industry. First, everything in China today follows the "careless doctrine." Whether it is national affairs or personal ethics, everything is careless and perfunctory. Second, the remuneration for writers in Chinese society is too meager. At present, the market price of translated works in our country's publishing industry is generally no more than five or six yuan per thousand words at most, and usually it is around two or three yuan, or even as low as one and a half yuan or one yuan. Another method is to draw royalties, which is at most 15%. Moreover, the sale of manuscripts mostly depends on introductions from people with great influence. Otherwise, no matter how faithful and fluent your translation is, bookstore owners will always refuse it. In this way, life is like a whip cruelly lashing on your back, children cry of cold, wives cry of hunger, and after eating the last meal, you don't know the next meal. How can you ask people to translate and narrate properly? Third, China today has neither scholars nor allows scholars. What China needs and has today are "omnipotent doctors," "who know astronomy above, geography below, are erudite and know both the past and the present, and are omniscient" "all-rounders." People who study military affairs can run education, people who study politics can run transportation, and people who study industry can also manage politics. As long as you are willing to do it, you will be suitable everywhere. On the contrary, if you are determined to study industry and only manage industry, and study education and only manage education, then you will run into walls everywhere. When this phenomenon invades the translation industry, it means that no matter what I study, as long as I can get business, I will boldly translate everything. People who study social sciences can translate works on natural sciences, and people who study natural sciences can also translate works on social sciences. Whether they understand it or not, who cares? In this way, isn't it like climbing a tree to catch fish to ask for a faithful and fluent translation?</p>
<p>In short, everything in China today is a mess, and this mess and that mess are inextricably linked. In a situation where everything is a mess, it is obviously impossible to want the translation industry not to be a mess, and to want people engaged in translation work not to "start translating from the first line" and not to "translate hard and translate randomly." It is even more impossible to seek to have "scholars who can conduct in-depth and painstaking research on a certain theory and apply it freely."</p>
<h3>Defending Bai Pu as Not Being a Heroic and Unrestrained School</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Ren Zhongmin's "General Discussion on Sanqu" says on page 35: "Bai Pu... is the most heroic and unrestrained."</p>
<p>Lu Kanru and Feng Yuanjun's "History of Chinese Poetry" says on page 1279 of the second volume: "Bai Pu... Although there are also works named for heroic and unrestrained style, such as "Drinking with Fishermen," most of them are known for their elegant and beautiful style." Zheng Zhenduo's "History of Chinese Literature," Volume 4, page 990, says: "His Sanqu is elegant and spirited, and his Xiaoling are especially refined."</p>
<p>I mostly agree with the judgments of the latter two books, but I hold a contrary opinion to the judgment of the former book.</p>
<p>Ren Zhongmin's "Sanqu of the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty" contains 36 Xiaoling and 4 Taoshu by Bai Pu. If we carefully analyze each Sanqu, then besides the "Drinking and Fishermen's Words" mentioned by Lu and Feng, only the first "Qing Dong Yuan," four "Yang Chun Qu Zhi Ji" (even this piece, Lu and Feng believe that it is "seemingly heroic and unrestrained but actually deeply gentle"), "Ink Mole on a Beauty's Face" and "Facing the Scenery," one each... a total of only nine pieces can be considered to be of the heroic and unrestrained school, which is less than a quarter of the total Sanqu. Therefore, it is inappropriate to conclude that Bai Pu is a heroic and unrestrained school based on this very small number of heroic and unrestrained Sanqu.</p>
<p>The remaining 31 pieces can be classified into the refined and beautiful school. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he is a poet of objects. His Sanqu are mostly works of moaning without illness, and he very unnaturally picks out some topics to chant. We can't see the reflection of the author's life in most of these Sanqu. He sings with great interest three times each for the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter, a total of twelve pieces. He also writes one piece each for blowing, playing, singing and dancing, six pieces for love, and one piece for snow || There are already 23 poems about objects here. (The heroic and unrestrained "Black Mole on a Beauty's Face" is also about objects, and the refined and beautiful "Xiaoshi Tune - Annoying Man" is about Su Qing, and the heroic and unrestrained "Chenzui Dongfeng - Singing of Fishermen" are also objective descriptions) These 23 pieces, as well as the second and third pieces of "Qing Dong Yuan," four pieces of "Desheng Ling," "Xian Lü Dian Jiang Chun," "Xiaoshi Tune - Annoying Man," etc., are all of the refined and beautiful school. Judging from these topics of wind, flowers, snow and moon, we can also know that heroic and unrestrained lyrics cannot be written in such subject matter, let alone mostly objective, unemotional depictions of scenery and objects! Not to mention that it is difficult to express heroic and unrestrained feelings, I am afraid that even gentle and restrained feelings are difficult to express?</p>
<p>I think Mr. Ren may have been influenced by Wang Guowei's hints. Wang Guowei said in his "History of Song and Yuan Opera - Articles on Yuan Drama": "Ren Fu is like Su Dongpo," which is also inappropriate. Even in terms of opera, Bai Pu's handed-down works such as "Wutong Rain" and "Wall Head Horse" also belong to the refined and beautiful school and not to the heroic and unrestrained school.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Things (38)</h3>
<p>— Jun Guosun</p>
<p>"Who on earth hit it? I was so busy that I forgot to tell you!"</p>
<p>Bo Tang thought for a while and shook his head contemptuously, saying:</p>
<p>"Isn't that what Shou Zichun hit | Didn't he send an invitation by express mail yesterday!"</p>
<p>"He's really free, this Shou Zichun!"</p>
<p>"Who's going to pay attention to his dinner tonight!"</p>
<p>The talk box was asked by the surrounding air again, and time passed by minute by minute. Suddenly, Dangdangdang three times, the large clock in the aisle just struck three o'clock. Bo Tang listened intently, and showed a look of uneasiness, as if his family would immediately be subject to the final trial. He walked back and forth in the dining room for a long time, and finally slapped himself on the head, saying: "I'll just make a phone call to ask Wen Qing." However, the result... Wen Qing had already left the writing room of the ["firm"]. This made him even more anxious...</p>
<p>"Alas | Within ten minutes, I must bring the money and the ["person"] to the firm together!" ["Maybe it's not on Gerochi Road and Lafayette Road! Fifth Brother Shi said, "Isn't this just Ma Wenqing dropping a bomb!"]</p>
<p>["Maybe that's right," Bo Tang said, "Maybe it's not right, I just hope to get a definite message as soon as possible." At this time, a servant brought in Representative Qiu, who happily said to Bo Tang:</p>
<p>"Boss, we have news!"</p>
<p>"Really?" Bo Tang said lively and doubtfully, "Did you see the old man?"</p>
<p>"No, but someone saw the boss's coachman Hongfa!"</p>
<p>"Who saw him?"</p>
<p>"Chunshan, the truck driver in the factory."</p>
<p>"Where did you see him?"</p>
<p>"In Ba Xian Qiao."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Around two o'clock."</p>
<p>"How did Chunshan see Hongfa?"</p>
<p>"Chunshan was eating in a restaurant in Ba Xian Qiao, and it happened that Hongfa was also there. He asked Hongfa where he came from. Hongfa said that he had sent the old boss to Chongqing Road early in the morning, and the car was usually left there. He took himself out, found a place to sleep, and now he was hungry, so he came to eat."</p>
<p>"Didn't they talk about anything else?"</p>

<h3>Under Financial Tightness and Narrow Fluctuations, Call Money Continues to Rise by Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Price drops... Exchange market tight... Short covering eager</p>
<p>The gold market remained stable yesterday, with continued narrow fluctuations. Banks' appetite trended inward, and gold prices rose accordingly. In the morning, due to the decline in both the British and American silver markets, British and American exchange rates contracted, while American and British exchange rates lengthened. The Shanghai Gold Exchange saw both increases and decreases in forward silver prices, but the number was minimal. Stock prices declined slightly, American cotton contracted by 25 pounds, and American wheat was late, contracting by more than five points. The raw cotton market seemed firm at the opening, but instead retreated slightly. After the opening, it was extremely quiet, with few transactions, only a few jiao movements. The HSBC exchange rate announcement showed that the shilling and US dollar remained unchanged. This was the quietest moment. The exchange market was pushed up by banks, and the process was tight. The potential for short covering in the gold market turned eager, especially among Daxing, Yongyuanxing, Yongyuanmao, and Yongyongfeng. However, due to the narrow scope, the number was also small. The market state was mediocre in the morning, without any special changes, because the US bank was closed tomorrow. The premium remained at 190 yuan. The market conditions in the morning are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 850.4 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.6 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 50 yuan. The exchange market opened with the British exchange rate flat and the American exchange rate slightly tight. The recent selling price was calculated as 1 shilling and 3 pence for the British exchange rate, and 28.0625 yuan for the American exchange rate. Initially, it retreated from 0.05 yuan to 0.02 yuan. Mitsui bought US dollars for October at 0.5 yuan. Yongfeng, Daxing, and Yongjin reached 1.5 yuan. Hengxing went on the market to sell, and then retreated to 0.04 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, but Mitsui still bought US dollars for October at 0.5 yuan. Although the transaction was small, the trend was firm. Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao, Yongdaxing, Yongyuanxing, Yongzhaofeng, and Changlian bought in succession. Mitsui ate US dollars for October at 4.375 yuan, and it rose to 4 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Yuanmao Yong sold slightly. Xinjie closed US dollars for September at 2.5, retreating to 3.2 yuan. Before long, this price was difficult to settle. Hengyu, Daxing, and Yonglai entered. Although Fuyu supplied it repeatedly, it rose to 4 yuan after Macquarie bought US dollars for December at 0.75. The silver company pushed up US dollars for August at 0.0625 yuan. Yuanxingyong then entered the market repeatedly, reaching 5.7 yuan. Hongxing sold goods. Sumitomo closed US dollars for November at 5.625. HSBC Yong sold October at 3.75, gradually retreating to 4 yuan. Although Daxingyong, Qianchangxiang entered at 5.5 yuan, it still trended peacefully and remained extremely quiet for a while as Wupin Shunli Hengyu and others came to sell again. Yuanmao Yong often accepted orders, and the situation remained stable. Finally, with the bank's appetite still healthy, Macquarie again accepted US dollars for December at 0.75. Yuanmao Yong worked hard to buy in, and Qingfayong also came to buy in, rising to 6.5 yuan. The noon closing was 856 yuan, and the goods were photographed at 5.8 yuan. After the closing, Hongxing, Yuanmao, Hengyu, and Dadecheng successively sold out, falling to 4.5 yuan. The highest price in the morning was 856.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 850.2 yuan, with a fluctuation of 6.3 yuan. As a result, it continued to rise by 5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price was 864.86 yuan due to the HSBC Bank's US dollar exchange rate remaining unchanged at 27.75 yuan, and the spot gold price was 864.86 yuan, which was about 9 yuan less than the closing price, about 5 yuan less than the previous close. The account price for this month was 861 yuan, and for September was 856 yuan. The morning replenishment water was 861 yuan. The premium remained at 190 yuan. Transactions remained scarce. In the market, Dafengheng and Dadecheng slightly supplied, but it was paid by the foreign merchants, and there were not many transactions. The total number of IOUs for this month up to the day before yesterday was 770.</p>

<h3>Securities Saturday Bond Market Stagnant and Lifeless</h3>
<p>｜Major Players Waiting and Watching... Transactions Sharply Reduced｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quite depressed. Because there were no changes in the environment, and because of the weekend, most people did not go to the market, so transactions were sharply reduced. Except for a few scattered retail investors who made slight entries and exits, major players made no trades, and the northern gang also made very few transactions. At the opening in the morning, only No. 1 slightly ate in, and the market prices of various listed stocks slightly rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. After entering, starting from the 20th year, there were not many transactions, and the supply side was slightly more visible, and the market price instead fatigued by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The market was stagnant and lifeless. At the close, scattered retail investors slightly sold out, and the various listed stocks were slightly fatigued by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The unified salt tax slightly improved, and the gold short whole six, etc. also brought a slight gain of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The trend was chaotic, entirely due to the major players waiting and watching, and had nothing to do with the rise and fall. As a result, the market price was slightly smaller by 0.1 to 0.3 or 0.4 yuan. The total number of transactions was calculated to be 5,672,000 yuan, of which 2,000 yuan was in spot goods, and the total of the futures unified salt tax was only 1,935,000 yuan, 695,000 yuan for troop reduction, 945,000 yuan for the 19th customs duty, 840,000 yuan for the 20th volume of the 20th customs duty, and the rest was only tens of thousands to 200,000 to 300,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Expected to Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported on Friday (11th) that the New York stock market slightly showed a jagged pattern at the close due to the final rebound of gold mining stocks. If there is no bad news, it will continue to rise next week. The total transaction volume for the whole day was only 1.34 million shares. Wheat fell by 0.05 yuan due to the public's disappointment with the government report, and long positions were closed. It seems that it can be bought when the market price falls. American cotton was disheartened and sold out by long positions due to the continuous hedging sales in the south, and as a result, it fell by about 40 pounds. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 97.47 Down 0.11</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 49.27 Down 0.02</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 31.34 Down 0.16</p>
<p>40 Bonds 88.15 Down 0.04</p>
<h3>Cotton and Foreign Cotton, High-Pressure Cotton Drops Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still fatigued, and the falling wind has not stopped. Because flaws were found in Indian and American cotton, the downstream trend is consistent. People's hearts are especially fatigued, and the market actually needs to stop. All gangs are unwilling to move, but some major players are抵空翻, and the market盘带 is firm. The future is particularly lacking in grasp.</p>
<h3>Forward Yarn Falls Another Yuan</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Renbiao pre-market, the market atmosphere was quite weak. Breaking the lowest price of 82 yuan this month, the situation is not good. 各月 fell by 0.5 to 0.7 yuan to 1.3 yuan.

Worldwide U.S. Cotton Usage since August 1st: 267, 366. Russia Continues Purchasing U.S. Cotton, Negotiations Ongoing.</p>
<p>New York, August 11th telegram reports on the week's cotton market situation. Government cotton production estimates exceed the average private estimates by over one million bales. When this report was released, many market participants had already closed their positions, and selling pressure emerged, which was absorbed by industry purchases and short covering. However, buying interest was not strong, and market prices fluctuated. General commercial reports were exciting, and the belief that authorities would adopt expansionary policies when necessary to achieve higher prices was also trusted. Therefore, the impact of cotton production figures was partially offset. Spot traders actively bought in preparation for sales to Russia. This was also a reason for maintaining the cotton market. It is rumored that this consignment order is almost completed. At the same time, overseas rumors indicate that negotiations for Russia's continued purchase of U.S. cotton are ongoing, and the belief that cotton prices will inevitably rise in the future remains unchanged. However, it is difficult to determine the future trend of the cotton market because cotton crops are progressing well, and there is the possibility of advance hedging in preparation for early listing of new cotton. According to today's ginning figures at the end of July, 171,000 bales have been ginned, compared to only 71,000 bales at the same time last year, and the average ginning figure for the past five years at the same time is only 66,000 bales.</p>
<p>Rice Market Weakens, Down 2 Jiao.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals numbered over thirty, and outbound traffic was stagnant. In addition, arrivals were slightly abundant, leading to a sharp decline in market conditions. The situation was exceptionally weak. Various types of thick japonica rice dropped by about 2 jiao. Du Yangjian also showed slackness. Although customer merchants continued to purchase 1,500 to 1,600 bags of rice, they only accepted large quantities. Thin rice followed the downward trend, with prices falling by over 1 jiao. Although prices were still similar, the quality of goods was high. Since the change of currency, the supply of goods has slightly increased, resulting in a flat and weak market. Dongxin rice remains at 7 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Arrivals from various sources numbered about twenty-three or twenty-four. White japonica rice sales remained sluggish, with prices slightly down by a fraction of a jiao. Early thin japonica rice still showed a weak trend. Du Jian and Dongxin japonica rice prices remained stable. Sheep-tip rice arrivals were scarce, and retail demand was good, with prices showing an upward trend. White yuan rice showed a tightening trend. Customer indica rice sales continued to be strong.</p>
<p>| All Rice Types Showed a Tightening Trend |</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer indica rice was initially expected to decline slightly. Due to the aged and poor color of the rice, prices were expected to fall. However, Fuzhou merchants suddenly became active, aggressively searching the market. They only disliked the low quality of existing rice, which did not meet their purchasing standards. They also found that the daily arrivals were scarce, and fresh, high-quality goods were difficult to obtain. Therefore, they purchased 400 bags of Jing indica rice from Hunan, priced at 6 yuan to 5 yuan and 5.7 jiao, 1,000 bags of Nanjing indica rice, priced at 5 yuan and 9.5 jiao to 5 yuan and 7 jiao, 107 bags of Wuxi indica rice, priced at 6 yuan and 3 jiao, and 500 bags of coarse indica rice, priced at 5 yuan and 2 jiao, totaling over 2,000 bags. All of these were purchased by Fuzhou merchants. Due to the active purchases of Fuzhou merchants, prices of all grades of rice, including medium and low grades, showed a tightening trend of 3 to 5 fen. If sales continue to be strong today and tomorrow, the market situation should gradually improve. In addition, there may be action to move goods, and the Biao flour factory may cover its short positions.</p>
<p>| Local Factories Purchased Flour for This Month |</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months initially fell and then stabilized. Due to the falling prices of foreign wheat, with Chicago falling by 1 yuan and 6 jiao and Canada falling by about 1 yuan and 1.2 jiao, market sentiment weakened. The opening price for this month hit a new record, falling to 2 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen, and 7 li and a half. Prices for other months also fell by a small amount, ranging from 1 to 2 fen. Later, due to the efforts of Wuxi factories to cover their short positions, prices rebounded after the second round, remaining at the same level as the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, prices were initially stable, but later, local factories gradually purchased flour for this month, even if they were not buying for actual sales. As a result, prices stabilized. Traders were selling off contracts for future months. Therefore, although the situation was stable, the increase was not significant. Based on the current situation, it seems that the downward trend has temporarily come to an end. However, if sales in the market do not improve, further changes are possible. As a result, the price for this month was 5 li higher than the previous day, while prices for other months were 1 fen higher. Prices for October and November were 5 li higher, and prices for December and January were 2.5 li higher.</p>
<p>Futures Wheat Was Flat, with Distant Months Falling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, futures wheat showed a flat and weak trend. Due to the decline in foreign wheat prices, most market participants' sentiment became depressed. However, large short sellers gradually covered their positions, and new short sellers were unwilling to immediately release their positions. Therefore, although the environment was not good, the downward trend seemed to have slowed slightly. In terms of the recent situation, the price for this month has temporarily stabilized, while distant months are still likely to be killed upon expiration. As a result, the price for this month remained unchanged, September fell by 2 fen, October and November fell by 1 fen, and December and January fell by 3 fen. There were still few spot wheat transactions. High-quality wheat was easier to sell, while medium and low-quality wheat remained sluggish. It is difficult to sell unless flour sales improve. The opening price for Yaowan wheat was 3 yuan and 9 jiao, Gaoyou wheat was 3 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, Jiangyan wheat was 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 3 fen, and Beijiang wheat was 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen, totaling 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>New Jiujiang Yellow Soybeans Arrived Sparsely, Sales Were Active.</p>
<p>| High-Quality Goods Rose by 5 Fen... Medium-Quality Goods Rose by 1 Jiao |</p>
<p>The supply of new Jiujiang yellow soybeans has been slightly scarce recently. Sales to markets such as this street, Ningbo, Xiamen, and Fuzhou have been active. The market trend has reversed and prices have risen. Due to the shortage of high-quality goods, demand for medium-quality goods has increased. Yesterday, the price of high-quality goods rose by 5 fen, and the price of medium-quality goods rose by 1 jiao. A total of over 700 bags of Chengmen soybeans and over 500 bags of Hongqiao soybeans were traded.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea, Thunderstorms and Scorching Heat Damage Autumn Silkworms.</p>
<p>Pingyao Autumn Silkworms Found to Be Infected with Yellow Disease. Autumn silkworm rearing is most prevalent in the Pingyao area of ​​Yuhang. They are currently in the peak leaf-eating stage of their third molt. The weather has been hot and humid recently, with thunderstorms, causing the silkworms to show signs of infection with yellow disease and stiffness. Instructors are currently taking measures to isolate them.</p>
<p>Lu Huang Factory Continues to Ship to Shanghai. Qingban, Pu'an, Shandong, and other ships have recently been loading Shandong new yellow factory warp, totaling 52 boxes. Including previous shipments, a total of over 200 boxes have been shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Prices Show Increased Steadiness. Yesterday, 38 boxes of August and September futures for brands such as Five-Star Peacock and Golden Deer were purchased from Hangzhou and Shaoxing, priced from 181 yuan to 169 yuan and 7.5 jiao net.</p>
<p>Factory Warp Prices Remain Small, Difficult to Sell Overseas. Raw silk market prices remain difficult to stabilize. The New York telegram indicates that silk prices have fallen further. Factories are unwilling to sell at a loss, making transactions difficult. Yesterday, only 40 bales of spot yellow and white factory warp were traded, with prices remaining flat and weak.</p>
<p>Luzhuang Zhenmei Tea Sales Brisk.</p>
<p>Recently, transactions of Luzhuang green tea have been brisk. Varieties such as Zhenmei, Zhucha, and Gongxi have been exceptionally popular. However, Zhenmei, which is regarded as the main product by the public, has been consistently viewed with caution by merchants, causing market prices to repeatedly decline. The market feels that this is a major drawback. Yesterday, Jinlong, Xiehe, and other companies that sell large quantities of Zhenmei tea from Tunxi, Wudong, and Qinxian were instructed by telegrams from overseas to make large purchases again. It is reported that over 1,000 boxes have been agreed upon, and continued development is expected next week. Red tea is also firm, but there is a shortage of stock in Qimen tea, leading to sparse transactions. Yesterday, Tongfu Foreign Company purchased over 300 boxes of tea from Hunan and Hubei, with a selling price of 39 yuan. The market price was also quite good.</p>
<p>Sugar Market, Coarse Sugar and White Sugar Prices Unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight increase in the price bid, resulting in a steady trend. The association's price for 24 coarse sugar and ordinary white sugar was 21 yuan for sellers and 20 yuan and 9.5 jiao for buyers. Both sides maintained their prices, and no agreement was reached. High-quality Double T Mark sugar was priced at 21 yuan and 1 jiao, up 5 fen. New Dutch Red sugar was priced at 16 yuan and 6.5 jiao, while old sugar was priced at 4 jiao and a half. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was priced at 21 yuan and 2.5 jiao, and CW Mark was priced at 21 yuan and 1.5 jiao, up half a jiao from the previous day. The First Grade cotton white sugar from local factories such as Zhonghua, Guohua, and Zhenji was priced at 20 yuan, with remaining sales as is. Zhongzi Ice was priced at 23 yuan and 6 jiao, Huazi Ice was priced at 4 jiao, and Guozhi Ice was priced at 22 yuan and 6 jiao. Only Guang merchants opened prices for over a hundred bags of Huizhou white sugar. Shizi was priced at 19 yuan and 9 jiao, and Qizi was priced at 19 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>North-South Goods, New Hainan Longan Meat Debuts.</p>
<p>| Prices Quoted by Merchants Vary Greatly... Not Yet Opened |</p>
<p>Hainan longan has a good harvest this year. However, the products from that area have small grains and are mostly sold after being peeled. The new goods have started to arrive sporadically. The initial debut prices are inevitably higher. Merchants are asking for 50 yuan, while buyers are only offering 40 yuan. The difference is still significant, and no deals have been made yet. However, there is still a lot of old stock, and sales are sluggish. The future market may not be able to rise too high.</p>

<p>Problems that Cannot Be Solved by Force. Pu</p>
<p>A few days ago, the reporter received a letter from a friend in Suiyuan, containing the following description of the situation along the route of Chahar and Suiyuan: [I left Pingjin on the 7th to Zhangjiakou to investigate the fur market and rural economic conditions. Zhangjiakou is a thoroughfare to Outer Mongolia. Before the 17th year of the Republic, the amount of fur coming to Zhangjiakou from Inner and Outer Mongolia was about 14.5 million yuan. The amount of domestic goods collected in Zhangjiakou and transferred to Outer Mongolia was about 10 million yuan per year. Since the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in the 17th year of the Republic, the source of fur from Outer Mongolia has been cut off, and domestic goods cannot be transported to Outer Mongolia. As a result, the Zhangjiakou market fell from 30 million yuan to 2-3 million yuan. The market is depressed, and finance is stagnant, which is only natural. In addition, there are heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, and bandits and soldiers are rampant. Most people are already in a situation where they cannot survive and cannot find a place to die. As a result, the psychology of the masses has changed drastically, and their thoughts are increasingly becoming resentful and hateful! This change in psychology is caused by the actual environment. If you want to remedy it, you can only start by improving this actual environment, which can never be achieved by using force to suppress it! Furthermore, from Zhangjiakou to Datong to Fengzhen to Pingdiquan and then to Suiyuan, what I saw along the way was even more unbearable to witness. As a result of the great drought in the 16th, 17th and 18th years of the Republic, more than 10,000 women from Fengzhen alone were sold into Guannei, and countless people starved to death. When I visited the Second Normal School of Suiyuan Province in Pingdiquan, it happened to be lunchtime for the students. I saw that each table of eight students had only a bowl of artemisia. The steamed buns and rice they ate were made of naked oat flour, which was rough and dark in color and difficult to swallow. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the feed for pigs is better than this, but the middle school students here enjoy it as if it were delicious. If the diet of middle school students is like this, the food of ordinary people can be imagined! ]</p>
<p>Recently, Zhangjiakou, Chahar, has aroused great attention and fear among people at home and abroad due to Feng Yuxiang's anti-Japanese issue. However, the government and authorities have not paid attention to the people's tragic situation caused by the commercial decline, natural disasters and man-made disasters over the years, and have not actively remedied it. I think this is the only reason why the government has failed to gain the trust and support of the people since the Republic of China. Paying attention to the suffering of the masses and striving to reduce the suffering of the masses is the only work that a government standing on a revolutionary position should carry out immediately. If this point is ignored, no matter how moving the government's propaganda is, it will all be impractical and meaningless. After a while, it will be exposed as a sham, and it will be worthless.</p>
<p>Why has Feng Yuxiang's armed resistance against Japan been opposed by the central government? The truth of the matter is still unclear, and we are unwilling to make any judgments. Moreover, the matter has ended, and the truth will come out one day. What we want to ask the government to pay attention to now is that armed resistance can be conquered by force, but the resistance that arises because most people have nothing to eat cannot be solved by force. In recent years, although the government has been talking about construction every day, there has been no construction at all. People who speak for the government always use suppressing bandits or讨伐 someone as an excuse. But where are the construction achievements in many places without bandits and without讨伐, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces? This is a fundamental issue that we want to stand on a purely public opinion position and hope the government will pay close attention to. The people's slogan should be:</p>
<p>[Actively prepare for resistance against Japan! Actively implement the Principle of People's Livelihood! ] This should be the case for the future foreign policy and domestic affairs of Chahar, and for the future foreign policy and domestic affairs of the whole country.</p>
<p>Life, A series of Numbers, A series of Facts. Zhu</p>
<p>Tailor</p>
<p>There are about 8,000 to 9,000 tailor shops in Shanghai, with at least 40,000 to 50,000 tailors. Suzhou, Yangzhou, Changzhou, Zhuji, Ningbo, Tiantai, Shaoxing, and Shanghai are the most numerous. In larger tailor shops, the boss owns a house, and the workshop is set up in the living room. Two rows of workbenches are placed along the walls (the tailors sleep on them at night). Three or four to more than ten tailors are hired to work. Smaller tailor shops only rent a room and the husband and wife work together without hiring tailors.</p>
<p>Each tailor shop worships Emperor Xuanyuan as their ancestor and has formed the Shanghai Tailor Shop Trade Association (located in Xuanyuan Temple in the city). The boss of each tailor shop must join the trade association and pay a quarterly membership fee of two 角, which makes them a member of the Tailor Shop Trade Association. Tailors from various regions have no other organizations and do not join the trade association, but many of them worship the old gods.</p>
<p>Tailor shops most commonly hire tailors and pay them on a daily basis, determining the wage standard based on the worker's skill level. Generally, those who are paid on a daily basis have an average monthly wage of 11 to 12 yuan, with food and lodging provided. Those who are paid per piece split the payment for each piece of clothing between the tailor and the boss. For example, for a silk cheongsam or robe, a tailor can make one piece per day, and the payment is two yuan and four 角. The tailor gets one yuan and two 角, and the boss also gets one yuan and two 角. In total, they can earn more than 20 yuan per month, but the tailor has to pay 6 yuan for food and 1 yuan for electricity per month. In terms of working hours, tailors who are paid on a daily basis work about 10 hours a day, and more than 11 or 12 hours during busy times at the end of the year. There are no fixed working hours for those who are paid per piece. Apart from a few major holidays when work is suspended for one or two days, tailor shops have no other days off throughout the year.</p>
<p>The boss of a tailor shop is not necessarily a tailor by trade. Some open tailor shops and do other jobs themselves, while some live entirely by exploiting tailors, but many others started out as tailors. The relationship between the tailor and the boss is mostly based on being from the same hometown. It is precisely because of this relationship that they allow the boss to exploit and squeeze them. The boss pays them wages in small installments, never on a monthly basis. Of course, the payment for each piece of clothing cannot necessarily be received immediately (most people who make a lot of clothes pay in three installments: Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the end of the year).</p>
<p>However, the tailor's daily income is enough to cover expenses. As for the few yuan that the tailor receives temporarily, they are returned to him on the gambling tools set up by the boss. Therefore, besides eating and sleeping, every tailor works for the boss and does not receive much wages himself.</p>
<p>I feel that although the labor expended by handcraft tailors is not as great as that of industrial workers next to machines, the methods of exploitation by tailor shop owners are no different from those of factory owners, and the suffering endured by tailors is no less than that of workers in factories!</p>
<p>Comfortable Nest, Giant Beast. Chen Shenglu</p>
<p>Grand Hotel</p>
<p>A brightly polished brass sign. [×× Grand Hotel] Five large, pitch-black characters. The face of the doorman also pitch-black.</p>
<p>Raise your head, first floor, second floor, third floor... seventh floor, bulging belly, gaping mouth, terrifying! At night, batches of men and women are swallowed into the belly. Tomorrow, those chewed and tired men and women will be spat out again, spat out. No one has any energy, everyone has a pale gray face.</p>
<p>Slow down, there are many dramas in the grand hotel. There are no greens, pickles, or rice here. This is originally a place for boys and girls to have fun. Damn it! If you are a poor bum, you will be thrown to the street.</p>
<p>Slow down, there are many dramas in the grand hotel. Second floor - white lights, white doors, oily floors, white-clothed waiters laughing at the entrance, electric bells - dinglingling...</p>
<p>Third floor - white lights, white doors, oily floors, white-clothed waiters laughing at the entrance, electric bells - dinglingling...</p>
<p>Fourth floor, fifth floor... electric bells - dinglingling. The smell of opium, the smell of flesh, the smell of pork chops, and the [Spearmint] in the girl's mouth.</p>
<p>[Hearing him say, I was so scared...] Beijing opera tune. [Wander around, wander around, wander around...] Jinghu sound.</p>
<p>[Ah, model, you hooked away my soul.] Unexpectedly, there is also a poet here! Dinglingling, room 203.</p>
<p>[Knock, knock, knock] The waiter dare not barge in. [Come in!] Not very good English. [Sir...?] [A can of Captaino] [Wait! I am used to Garico] [Then, take another can of Garico.]</p>
<p>Concubine</p>
<p>Happy to see something good, one thigh resting on the sofa, bare feet, a silk vest that almost exposes her breasts, short pants, if they were shorter, damn it, no one would dare to look directly.</p>
<p>Giggle, giggle, giggle! The young man in suit pants cannot stand still, cannot sit still, just circles around her, paces around.</p>
<p>[Oh my! You are wearing new leather shoes, godson, you should dance with godmother tonight.]</p>
<p>The young man plucked his eyelashes, hushing Foxtrot, soles on the floor, creating two melodies. Damn it, looks like a monkey dancing on Huaguo Mountain. The young man, hushing and circling, circled to the wardrobe mirror. Stopped, looked at his own face, smoothed his hair.</p>
<p>[What a tender young gigolo,] the concubine made a face, her chest trembling. The young man threw himself into her arms... [Dear mom, give me two hundred yuan to buy a few suits!]</p>
<p>[...Okay...as long as you...as long as you every day...] the concubine gasped delicately, gasped delicately. The French window curtains were pulled up with a [whoosh].</p>
<p>[Crack, crack, crack...] The sound of dominoes hitting the tabletop, clear and crisp. Not just one place, 202, 210, 224... third floor, fourth floor are all ringing.</p>
<p>Dinglingling, send this check quickly. [Damn it! I am so smitten with the little Ayuan from the Crescent family.]</p>
<p>[What's so rare about it, can that goods be sold? Not to mention one little Ayuan, ten little Ayuans are yours.]</p>
<p>Two skinny men lay on the half-bed without mosquito nets, squeezing a smoking tray. Smoke came out of their noses, smoke came out of the corners of their mouths. Two pointed heads were thrown on the white wild duck down pillow, as if they were going to embed their heads in it.</p>
<p>[Young Master Zhang...] A delicate voice, followed by the waiter's hand bringing in, bringing in. A face with a forced smile was also brought in. And, a blood-red cheongsam, blood-red high heels, blood-red cheeks, just a blood-red mouth.</p>
<p>[Bang,] the door closed with the waiter's hand.</p>
<p>[A hearty dinner,] the waiter instructed the chef, [Mr. Zhang from room 314.]</p>
<p>Second floor...third floor...fourth floor...the smell of opium, the smell of flesh, the smell of pork chops, and the [Spearmint] in the girl's mouth. [Hearing him say, I was so scared...] [Wander around, wander around, wander around...] [Knock, knock, knock] [Come in!]...</p>
<p>Depression, depression, everything is sinking. The elevator is hung with a [Temporarily Out of Service] sign, the white-clothed waiter is thrown there dozing off, and the lights are also fading.</p>
<p>The Moon Lights on the roof flew away with wings.</p>
<p>Raise your head, first floor, second floor, third floor... bulging belly, closed mouth, a wooden sign hanging on the lips [Full].</p>
<p>A giant beast swallowed a large number of men and women, squatting in the dark city, squatting. It has other kinds of it squats all around, Grand Hotel, Grand Hotel, Grand Hotel.</p>
<p>One Exceptional Man Out of Ten Thousand in the Slums. Zheng Pobai</p>
<p>Hut</p>
<p>If someone asked... [Die] are you willing to go? I think at least 9,999 out of 10,000 people would answer [No]. Indeed, even ants are greedy for life, let alone humans. But Xiao Wuzi, a Jiangbei man who lives in a hut, is the exception of that one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>Xiao Wuzi's family of three - himself and Xiao Wuzi's wife, plus a son with a scabby head - usually lived by Xiao Wuzi pulling a rickshaw. Although they were also hungry one meal and full the next, their days were always smooth. Since Xiao Wuzi's legs were crushed by a car carrying soldiers from the Japanese devils, the family has fallen into a state of distress.</p>
<p>The thing is like this... A few days ago, Xiao Wuzi was pulling a rickshaw and looking around on a secluded road, looking for customers. Suddenly, he saw a foreign woman across the road waving to him. He was overjoyed and pulled the car and ran over recklessly. But, my God! A car carrying soldiers, faster than a fire engine, proudly crashed over, and Xiao Wuzi and his car collided head-on with the car. After a slight groan, he passed out. When he woke up, he was already lying on the broken mat like he was paralyzed, and his legs below his knees were burning with pain. He really wanted to lift them up and take a look, but he couldn't, it was impossible.</p>
<p>According to Ah Gou, who pulls a rickshaw next door... Since he saw Xiao Wuzi knocked down by the car that day, the car stopped for a while, and a Japanese fellow came down to take a look, grunted, got back into the car, and then the car backed up, backed up, and drove to the side.</p>
<p>International Radio Station Moscow Labor Exchange. Tang Lan Shi</p>
<p>Due to the deepening of the capitalist economic panic, the number of unemployed workers in the world has now increased to more than 30 million. In various countries, the entrances of labor exchanges and factories are lined with hungry lines of people demanding bread and work. Although the United States has now employed 500,000 people under President Roosevelt's recently announced National Economic Recovery Program, if compared with the total number of unemployed workers in the United States, it shows how small this number of 500,000 is, and whether the wages earned by these 500,000 newly employed workers are enough to live on is still a question. At the tram stations, newspaper stands, and food shops in Moscow, there are long lines of people, but at the entrance of the labor exchange, there is no one.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Moscow Labor Exchange once said to a journalist: [The Five-Year Plan has completely eliminated unemployment. In 1928, there were still 241,765 unemployed people in Moscow. But this great plan has reduced the number a lot. The problem of unemployed skilled workers is no longer seen, and the number of unemployed urban workers is decreasing day by day. Many farmers have come from the countryside, but later the farmers became fewer and fewer. At the beginning of 1930, there were still 45,552 unemployed people. But in a few months, even they were absorbed by the factories; we had nothing to do at that time. In the summer of 1930, the labor exchange temporarily closed its doors.]</p>
<p>[Doesn't that mean that even your staff members had nothing to do?] the journalist asked. [No! We had new things to do at that time, to find workers for the factories.] He opened a booklet and said, [Look, for example, May 1932. Moscow alone needed 33,417 new workers, and we could only supply 6,619! The factories called many times and said, [Quickly help us find a lot of workers, even unskilled ones are fine.] But where could we get so many new workers? So we could no longer sit in the office. All the staff members were sent to the countryside to find workers. Offices were set up at all the train stations, and advertisements were posted to recruit workers. Later, after a few months, a large number of staff members in the central agencies were laid off, and some factories also reduced the number of workers. As a result, the anti-Soviet newspapers took the opportunity to slander the Soviet Union, saying that these laid-off people were neither registered nor subsidized, and were even worse off than unemployed workers in capitalist countries.]</p>
<p>[Doesn't that mean that you have unemployed people here again?] the journalist asked again. [Just the opposite. The laid-off people were immediately absorbed by other factories, and it was still not enough! Look. In December 1932 and January 1933, the factories asked us for 50,435 new workers, and we could only supply 40,529. In February, in addition to the 10,000 workers missing last month, 128,612 new workers were added. And in the new industrial areas, there is an even greater shortage of new workers. For example, in Magnitogorsk, 35,000 new workers were needed last fall, but only a few thousand were obtained!]</p>
<p>He went. Xiao Wuzi was also carried back by him in his own rickshaw.</p>
<p>When Xiao Wuzi's wife saw her husband's two bloody legs from the cut-off trouser legs, she was so anxious that she was crying and wandering around. Old Uncle Gui, who was older, had an idea. He advised her to send Xiao Wuzi to ×× Hospital to see a doctor. There, in addition to the two 角 ocean registration fee, there was no charge for medicine. Xiao Wuzi's wife begged Uncle A Ming to borrow 800 wen of high-interest money, and asked several neighbors to carry Xiao Wuzi to the hospital on a plank door. When she handed the five hundred wen wrapped in paper and the other hundred wen to the registration window, the registration clerk said that copper coins were not accepted, and told her to exchange them for 角 tickets. Later, she finally registered with 640 wen.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at the two legs that didn't look like legs. He said to Xiao Wuzi's wife that if these two legs were sawed off, there was still a 50% chance of saving his life, otherwise, I'm afraid... After a series of discussions, these two unfortunate legs were sawed off by the doctor like a carpenter sawing off two legs while Xiao Wuzi moaned.</p>
<p>Xiao Wuzi's wife continued to see Xiao Wuzi at ×× Hospital several times with the high-interest money she borrowed. Uncle A Ming saw that Xiao Wuzi didn't look like he would get better - even if he got better, he didn't look like he would work - and that scabby-headed son wouldn't sell for much money either. He was afraid that the 4,000 wen of capital would be lost, so not only was he unwilling to continue borrowing money, but he also forced Xiao Wuzi's wife to pay him back the principal and interest. Although Xiao Wuzi's wife begged him to postpone it for a few days, his long-hardened heart was not moved, and he limited her to pay back the principal and interest within three days, otherwise, he would use the few pieces of furniture that were the only ones to offset this amount. All of this was clearly seen and heard by Xiao Wuzi, who was sleeping on the broken mat and moaning.</p>
<p>When the night was quiet and everyone was asleep, Xiao Wuzi's wife was already snoring because of her hard work for several days. Xiao Wuzi touched the legs that were aching from time to time, with the incense ash smeared on them because there was no money to see a doctor. The past and the future were circulating in his mind. After a while, he bit his teeth and said... [Let's do it this way.]</p>
<p>The next morning, Xiao Wuzi's wife woke up and saw that her husband was not on the broken mat that was less than five inches off the ground, and the door made of thin boards and old newspaper was also wide open. She screamed and hurriedly got up and ran out to take a look. A trail of blood with some incense ash extended all the way to a small, filthy ditch less than half a foot deep not far from the hut, and a legless corpse was lying face down.</p>

<h3>Current Sales Only One Hundred and Eighty Bales</h3>
<p>The current yarn sales are quite sluggish. It is found that all the various merchant groups only bought 180 bales for the entire day. The market price fell by fifty cents. The purchase amounts of each merchant group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland  130  Peers  10  Guangdong  10 Wuhu  25  Jiangxi  1  Fujian  7  The cotton market is falling sharply, and the situation is quite panic-stricken, because the overseas cotton market has seen a consistent fall, and people are suddenly panicked. The Ningbo group, due to the closure of the yarn factories there, and the lack of acceptance of new cotton on the market, coupled with a bountiful harvest year, has sent telegrams to Shanghai to sell their cotton for speculation. The number of bales is increasing daily, but the buyers this month are still holding tight, and the intention to squeeze the shorts has not been extinguished.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Group Massively Dumps Standard Futures</h3>
<p>The Zheng standard futures market opened poorly. The Ningbo group dumped, and each month fell by fifty, sixty, seventy cents. In the afternoon, those who profited closed their short positions, nearly making five points, and the distant months fell by one point. The total daily transaction volume was 235,400 dan. The amounts sold were Yuanda 9,100 dan, Changfeng 6,400 dan, Tonghe 3,200 dan, Xincheng 5,500 dan, Yuanxingchang 11,600 dan, and Changhe 3,500 dan. The amounts bought were Chunji 6,400 dan, Rongxing 3,900 dan, Gengfeng 5,100 dan, Shenchang 5,100 dan, Dachang 5,900 dan, and Yiyu 2,800 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
