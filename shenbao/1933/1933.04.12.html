<h3 id="c16">華盛頓會議弦外之音乃 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>自世界經濟恐慌日趨嚴重。資本主義列强之统流者。在整個頓危中。不能不殫思竭慮。以試最後之掙持。政府要人。政府要人。政黨領袖。僕僕道途。其手忙足亂之情形。歷歷如繪。日内瓦之趣劇。旣因水盡山窮。而不得不停鑼息鼓。四强協定之建議。復因利害衝突。而終于流産。資本主義國際之中心。乃忽移至美京之華盛頓。美利堅之金融資産階級。旣爲目下整個資産階級之權威。則此種中心之轉移。殆亦爲勢所必至。理有固然者。</p>
<p>華盛頓會議之不能有造於目下之經濟恐慌。巳具見昨前兩日本報所論。羅斯福氏計劃之主點。爲（一）充分减低關稅以鼓勵國際貿易。（二）逐漸恢復金本位以安定國際匯兌。與（三）提高物價以解救目前之恐慌。此外銀價問題。亦在討論之列。其標榜之主義。則爲普遍的放棄國家主義的經濟政策。而戰債問題。蘇俄問題。與遠東問題。則似將爲實現上述計劃之交換條件目下世界之經濟恐慌。爲生産力空前之澎漲。此龐大之生産力。非有一劇烈之世界戰爭。不能加以破壞。在生産力未經破壞之前。倘生産仍處於無政府狀態。則物價稍有增高。生産即瞬復過剩。關稅即令减低。亦不過强心針之暫時作用。而决不能根治目下生産方式之矛盾。三百萬萬圓貿易額之增加。恐亦爲夢想徒勞而已。而金本位之放棄。旣爲列國對美國黄金政策之革命手段。則恢復金本位之要求。實等于希冀放棄金本位各國之自動解除武裝。是否可能。更屬疑問。其提高物價及所謂銀價問題則尤爲空洞虚玄。難見事實。要之國家主義的經濟與國家主義的政治。實爲資本主義之必然産物。國家爲私有財産制度之集團。則在私有財産制未消滅以前。而欲撤廢國家之瀋籬。詎爲可能之事實。故所謂華盛頓會議者。即能通過若干之議案。亦僅爲一纸具文。一言實行。則將觀望頓起。祗須有一國國會不能批准此議案。則一切均成泡影。恐其效果。將求如胡佛氏停付戰債宣言之能閧動一時而不可得也。</p>
<p>雖然。以上云云。乃指會議正文而言。所謂遠東問題。旣可能成爲實現羅斯福計劃之交換條件。則弦外之音。誠有耐人尋味者。列强眼中之遠東問題。终不出一分贓問題。在分贓未洽之前。儘可仗義執言。以高論博取世界之同情。一旦分贓妥貼。則交易而退。各得其所。自食前言。恬不爲怪。此高冠赴會之各國代表。旣各因利害之不同。而各挾所求以就道。則日本帝國主義之所挾者。其爲遠東問題。殆無疑義。松岡氏之由日内瓦轉美也。道路傳言。均謂其將游說美國。置中國於共管。果也華盛頓會議高唱入雲之際。美前副國務卿凱塞爾氏。已爲史汀生主義别作註脚。而前商部遠東司長艾德烈。則公然主張東三省可經由國聯以交付日本帝國主義之治理。蛛絲馬脚。吾人不能不信松岡游說。已有若干之成功。而所謂華盛頓會議者。或將繼國聯而爲分劃中國之刀爼。宰懦羊以弭羣虎之爭。或亦爲資本主義列强計無所出之一着。所可惜者。則盡懦羊之肉。或猶不足以飽羣虎之飢腸耳。</p>
<p>同時美國對於蘇聯之承認。忽以停頓聞。其爲留待英人重整對蘇陣線提議之攷慮。亦爲顯而易見之一着。要之華盛頓會議。實爲資本主義列强整理最後防陣之盛舉。其所採之手段。將不外一面犧牲弱小民族。以緩和内部之矛盾。而一面以聯合對蘇爲振作精神之興奮劑。然同時現諸報端者。則又有印度之排日。蘇波之聯歡。與法意之交惡。則此最後之掙持。又不能不斷定其爲終成泡影也。</p>

<p>（哈爾濱）觀於滿洲晨昨日所發生之事件、﹁僞滿國﹂與俄國似有發生嚴重的鐵路爭議之趨勢、昨日日軍當局揚言將用其自己員役以維持中東路車務、此次爭議、由中東路局不許於西比利亞通車到後開出滿洲里與哈兩濱間之火車而起、路局有此舉動、係奉中東路總辦俄人魯迪之命令、而魯迪之所以發此命令者、殆因﹁僞滿國﹂當局與警察斷絶外貝加爾與中東路之聯絡、故作此報復行動也、</p>

<p>定今日赴港返原籍晋京請願期尚未定</p>
<p>遠東社云、我國旅墨西哥華僑、因受該地政府及人民排華影響、不能立足、中有一部份一百四十餘人、乘美國大來公司門羅總統號輪船回國、該輪於昨日上午八時、停靠浦東大來碼頭、華僑總會並派彭燦光前往照料、</p>
<h3 id="c88">回國經過 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>據全球華僑總公會總幹事彭燦光君語遠東社記者、我國旅墨西哥華僑、約有二萬餘人、大多數均係經商及勞工、此次墨國突然排華、其中經商者、以受排華影響、頗多宣告破産、而向爲勞工者、則頓遭失業、以致不能立足、均紛紛轉入美國、蓋墨西哥與美國國境相近也、美國政府以國内失業工人、巳屬衆多、勢不能容納如許失業華人、乃遣送回國、該華僑等、本擬乘搭昌興公司日本皇后號回國、嗣以旅費無着、爰改乘美國大來公司門羅總統號輪來滬、至於一切船費、膳費、美當局將向我國政府要求發還、此即係此次回國經過情形也、</p>
<h3 id="c89">排華原因 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>彭君復謂、此次墨西哥排華最大原因、在國際間均有不景氣現象、而各國之經濟恐謊、實不下我國、墨西哥亦因受不景氣所迫、國内失業者日多、而我國旅墨華僑、經商頗形發達、同時勞工界亦佔有極重要地位、故該國人民爲謀生活起見、乃不顧兩國國交、舉行排華運動、我國駐墨公使馮崇志、曾與該國政府交涉、但該國政府非惟不加制止、反在暗中指示、由此可見墨國排華原因之一斑矣、</p>

<p>前日看了尤先生答覆我的信、怱怱地寫了一篇與尤先生商榷，因爲篇幅關係，暫告一結束，兹再提出數點就敎於尤先生與其他讀者及編輯先生：（一）﹁新式桃花源﹂的政治問題。尤先生對於這個問題，便首先自陷於矛盾。旣說﹁新式的桃花源是一個交通便利，科學生産，有敎育，重衛生，優美純潔的鄉村﹂，自然是與世無爭，彷彿所謂﹁鑿井而飲，耕田而食，帝力於我何有？﹂然而尤先生又說：﹁要都市中志士仁人，到鄉村中去領導農民來改造建設，解除痛苦，﹂這就有問題了。我們要問：所謂農民的痛苦，自然是苛捐雜稅了，你怎樣去領導農民來解除呢？所謂農民痛苦，當然是高利貸的剥削了，你又怎樣領導農民來解除呢？農民要種糧榖，而軍閥官僚逼着他種罌粟，你又怎樣領導農民來解降道種痛苦呢？耕者無其田，怎樣領導農民去要求﹁耕者有其田﹂的支票的兌現呢？土豪劣紳與軍閥官僚，欺壓農民，你又怎樣領導農民來解除他們的痛苦呢？假加農村中，有的（自然是多數）没有飯吃，有的糧食﹁堆積如山，﹂你怎樣領導農民來改造建設呢？軍閥自己相打，要勒逼農民供應糧餉，繳納軍費，你又怎樣領導農民來解除這種痛苦呢？農村之中，貧民反對富農，你到底站在那一邊呢？假使你的桃花源在通州，日本的海軍陸戰隊上了岸。你自然是不打仗的，自然要避之大吉，因爲我們的農民太﹁愚昧﹂了，如你所說的，那你的新式桃花源又怎樣生存呢？掛太陽旗吧？不然，徙而之他，一時又造不出這樣﹁優美純潔的鄉村﹂，怎樣辦呢？假使你的﹁新式桃花源﹂在贛州，或撫州（贛南，贛西，山水明秀，交通亦甚便利，最合於尤先生的新式桃花源的建設），共軍來了，把你的桃花源洞口掛上紅旗，你怎樣辦呢？國軍來了，又說你通匪，你又怎樣辦呢？十八世紀中葉法國的一個模範村和比國的一個大犧牲家都解决不了這個問題，他們這種桃花源，只是資本主義社會中的一種修道院式的，用消極方式維護資本主義社會的勾當，於整個的農村經濟有什麽關係呢？尤先生！這些問題，我們一定要求你給個明白的答復。（二）﹁農村敎育﹂的政治問題。假定尤先生的﹁新式的桃花源﹂成了功，農村敎育完滿實現，那我　敎：敎育些什麽呢？尤先生是學農業的，當然是種子改良，耕地改良，播種改良，施肥改良，機械化，電氣化，農民要達到此種地步，必須對於普通敎育，有相當的知識，靑年農民因此也引起了自身的覺悟，他們對於土地關係之要求改革，對於苛捐雜稅之要求廢除，對於土豪劣紳，貪官汚吏之表示反抗，甚至他們糾合農民起來抗日。這種運動一定是不能免的，那末，尤先生身當其境，又怎樣來領導他們呢？這種敎育豈不是﹁咳嗽帶出癆病來﹂？我有一個朋友，從前辦鄉村敎育非常有成績，農民子弟個個精神百倍，然而也就因遭了當局的注意，結果，學校解散，學生槍斃了幾個（有人說十幾個，這自然是所謂亂黨，）他老先生溜之大吉。又有一個朋友他在上海附近辦了一些農村學校，據說也很有成績。有一次我會見他，我預祝他的成功，同時我又預弔他的失敗。因爲他的農村敎育若果辦得眞有成績，農民子弟一定不是那些馴服的羔羊，一定不會不與地方士紳與官府發生衝突，結果只有失敗。（三）抗日與﹁農民敎育﹂的問題。現在一斑士大夫在這個失去四省土地的﹁罪孽深重﹂的情况之下，明知眞正抵抗，第一個條件就是要讓民衆自己起來，實行全國武裝的動員，這末一來，革命的民族戰爭擴大了，民衆的勢力自然也隨着擴大了，這自然是不方便，結果，惟有在﹁長期抵抗，﹂﹁準備抵抗，﹂﹁敎育救國，﹂﹁學衛救國，﹂﹁經濟絶交，﹂﹁敵如來攻，决予抵抗﹁的各種形式之下消沉下去。而遣各種形式之中最有力的一種就是﹁敎育救國，﹂他們的理由是工人不能起來抵抗，因爲他們太没有敎育；農民更没有希望，因爲他們太﹁愚昧，﹂太無﹁敎育。﹂這種話頭，說得何嘗不冠冕堂皇，然而這一話語之下，隠藏着的是什麽東西呢！一方面是掩飾他們喪師失地，不戰而逃，或戰而不力，或此戰而彼逃，以全軀保妻子的罪惡，一方面又是緩和大衆民族戰爭，反帝戰爭的熱情。至於眞正說到勞苦羣衆的敎育，在任何歐美的學校是受不到的，也是任何大學敎授與東西洋留學生所敎不到的！至於農民，自然也是這樣。他們儘可一字不識，然而他們能以深切地感覺到本身的種種苦痛。他們雖不能詩云子曰，他們却都知道土豪劣紳，貪官汚吏是他們的仇人，他們雖不會說什麽主義，什麽民族，他們却是反抗帝國主義與推翻專制的一個偉大的力量；英國的大憲章運動是這樣完成的，法國的大革命是這樣經過的，尤先生！你要說農民敎育嗎？那就没有比法國大革命還好的敎育，没有经俄國革命還好的敎育。而這富於歷史意義的偉大敎訓，又是反對苛捐雜稅，减租减榖，反對貪官汚吏，反軍閥戰爭，反帝國主義戰爭的口號之下所行的鬭爭的各種敎育匯合起來的必然結果。尤先生！這種敎育，我敢說，你絶不曾在你的大學講義和農塲實騐報告書中學習過，一定不曾！（四）什麽人﹁誠實無欺。﹂我前函中駁先生話，是的，我是認定﹁上層分子多勢利貪財，店員工人還是誠實不欺﹂（這是借用尤先生的話，我十二分同意，我的話頭雖然是不盡如尤先生的說法，）尤先生說﹁我武斷﹂並且申辯道：﹁須知善惡智愚，無處不有，絶對不能拿貧賤富貴來做標準。﹂其實這是事實。我並不是說，士大夫當中，没有一二個好人，誠實不欺的人。（這種成分，也要打個幾折，）然而最大多數的是貪鄙勢利；我也不是說，店員工人中，没有少數壞人，然而最大多數的是誠實不欺的。而且說富貴上層分子不好，並不是我的新發明，古人不是說﹁肉食者鄙﹂麽？不是說﹁腦滿腸肥﹂麽？不是說過﹁高明之家，鬼瞰其室﹂嗎？不是說過﹁高梁文繡﹂無好子弟嗎？至於尤先生八日的信申辯：﹁我說鄉民是比較的誠實，﹂這與前信不同　；前信說：﹁鄉民誠實，未有城中人欺詐，﹂這是一個﹁全稱肯定﹂的邏輯命題，絶没有比較的意思。卽承認你是說﹁比較﹂，也是那整個的農民與整個的﹂城中﹂（應該說﹁城市﹂）對立起來。城市的人如何，我們上面已經說過；現在再說農民，中農，農村的貧農，農村的流氓貧農。我們中國所謂土豪劣紳，他們接近城市，與商業資本，工業資本，銀行資本有密切的關係，並且也要用欺詐，不是他們老子娘生下地就會欺詐，而是他們的社會關係，使他們不得不欺詐，這難這不是事實嗎？尤先生跑回中國十多年，走過許多的農村，難道是兩眼閉起來走的嗎？農村市集上的流氓之詐欺取財，魚肉貧農，所在皆有，尤先生難道也不曾看過聽過麽？我的外家是農民，我可以說一半是在農村生長起來的，這一層我比你知道的更多更切實。末了，我還要請尤先生睜開眼睛，回過頭來（這自然是我的﹁幻想﹂）向着城市中大多數的工人店員與農村中的大多數的農民，尤其是貧農。我還要告訴你，從城市跑到農村中去的，至少是尤先生心目中的，﹂識字能文﹂的朋友，就没有﹁領袖人物﹂的資格。他們的眼光只看見地主，富農。他們爲地主，富農服役，絶不會站在農民和貧民的利益上去﹁領﹂導他們，至於﹁劉先生﹂的字典上向來就不曾有過﹁悲觀﹂這兩個字，也不曾有﹁向後轉﹂這三個字，請你放心，不過我很慚愧！思想是不能改變的，因爲我不願意做一高等華人！又前昨兩日讀了石愚君張梅君關於此問題的意見，許多的地方可以補這篇文字的不足。近來電影院排演的狂流一劇，描寫城市工業發展，人口過剩，大家没有出路，這都是事實，然而牠的結論却是敎大家到鄉村去。尤先生的意見與此劇的主要結論完全吻合，這絶不是偶然的事。殊不知道，鄉村之所以破産，根本原因就是資本主義的發展與軍閥骨戰，苛捐雜稅等等；農村破了産，土地日形集中，農村人口日形相對的過剩，大家在相率跑到城市，城市裏没有辦法，大家却又想（自然是我們的﹁理想家﹂在想）提倡到回到鄉村去。他們對於資本主義的前途之必然的運命絶不肯想，也不敢想，自然也不敢做進一步的解决，那末，只有開倒車了！意有未盡，率贅數語，質諸讀者，以爲如何？</p>
<p>更正昨日讀者顧問有數處應更正：（一）﹁才曉得尤先生是個﹁親日······﹂的一位農業專家！﹂下脫﹁我們論事論理，光背履歷是没用的，要看你表現的是什麽﹂一句。（二）﹁他們是那一輩富農的﹁貴同學﹂呢﹂應改爲﹁他們屬於農民中那一階層呢？﹂（三）﹁至於中國的農業經濟，在帝國主義的資本與商品及本國的商業資本﹂的﹁商業﹂兩字應删去。通訊手續（一）開明姓名·年齡·性别·籍貫·職業·詳細住址，（二）附足回信郵票、（三）貼用本欄上角通訊印花。來函叙述事實。須簡單明瞭。字迹須淸楚。凡不附足回信郵票、不開明詳細住址、除可於本欄發表外、槪不作復、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>在美國解除酒禁以後，我聽得他們的前國務副卿凱塞爾在費城演說竟對於舉世界所知的史汀生不承認﹁滿洲國﹂主義，另作新解。以爲：此主義並未剔除美國或將承認﹁滿洲國﹂之可能性，因當初發表此主義的時候，不曾聲明美國將永不承認﹁滿洲國﹂，云云。</p>
<p>照着凱塞爾君這般的翻案，天下的事没有一件不可以翻案；因爲有許多否定的話，往往不曾加上﹁永不﹂的字樣。譬如：判决一個罪犯，說他罪在不赦；要是，翻案曲解，便好說：罪在不赦，不是永遠罪在不赦；今天不赦，明天便不妨赦；現在不赦，眨一眨眼便不妨赦了。又如：粉墻上寫着﹁不准小便﹂字樣，你儘可以對着粉墻而小便。有人向你詰責，你可說：上面没有﹁永不﹂字樣，可見寫的時候是不准人家小便，現在時間過了，自有准人小便的可能性了。﹂</p>
<p>其實呢，存心要取消前說，便是有了﹁永不﹂字樣也没有用；滿淸時代做官的重大處分，呌做﹁永不﹂叙用，似乎永遠没有叙用的日子了；但受處分的人，只須善於鑽謀和運動，那麽，第一步便可懇請政府撤消﹁永不﹂字樣，第二步便可堂而皇之的做他的官了。</p>
<p>凱塞爾君，你可是在解放酒禁以後多飲了幾杯啤酒以致說這醉話麽？你飲了美國啤酒，不過一時陶醉，不久便有淸醒的日子；你飲了太陽啤酒，那便糟了！那便糟了！</p>

<p>— 張芷痕</p>
<p>﹁收天下兵，聚之咸陽，銷以爲鐘鐬，金人十二，重各千石，置宫廷中·﹂我們讀史記秦始皇本紀中這幾句，便明白始皇在當時的用意。始皇武力統一天下，恐怕有人不服，革他的命，推翻他萬世帝王的寶座，所以限制民間的武器。</p>
<p>秦始皇雖死去二三千年，他的軀殻想久已化爲塵土；可是他的主義和精神，却亘萬古而常新。你不信麽？最近却有一個例證，待我說來：</p>
<p>﹁英國軍縮草案僅規定中國有飛機一百架。﹂中國土地雖不大，却也不小，區區一百架飛機，在國防上，濟什麽事。但現代世界棄始皇却只准你有一百架飛機，你還敢不遵從麽？你倘若多所要求，你須當心現代秦始皇要疑心你意懷叵測，要疑心你擴張武備，想翻身，想和他們爲難，想推翻他們世界覇王的寳座。（註：現代秦始皇，不止一人，據說有五個，稱爲五大覇王。）</p>
<p>某雜誌上曾有下列一段文字：﹁美國商用飛機在三千五百架至五千架之間，······現在增加的愈我了。﹂啊呀！商用的飛機，已有這樣的驚人的數字，軍用的可想而知，而况，商用的未嘗不可搖身一變，變爲軍用。</p>
<p>有人問我：﹁照一百與三五千數字比較看來，美國的面積想比我國大三五十倍吧。﹂我說：﹁痴貨！這其中另有道理呀，秦宫不妨放着十二金人，我們小百姓家中，准藏一根鐵釘，已算﹁皇恩浩蕩﹂了。</p>
<p>秦始皇精神不死！秦始皇萬歲！</p>

<p>我們中國人，受着數千年禮敎的東縛，所以男女方面的愛情，總是覥覥靦靦，羞人答答的，除却水晶簾底，亞字欄邊；决不肯在人前做出旖旎温馨的情狀來，歐美人士，一切的一切，比較我們解放的多，大庭廣衆間，男女不妨握手接吻，抱腰踊舞，决没有人詫奇訝異的，並且他們對於愛情，都有相當的研究，愛情專家，著成男子須知，婦女必讀等書，差不多有數百千種，家絃户誦，奉爲金科玉律，男子於上午九點鐘前出外上寫字間辦公，下午四時後返家，一天不見，到這時候，雙方便很穠蜜的偎依談笑，婦擅悲婀娜的，更在晚餐後奏一曲戀歌，曼聲和着，使得丈夫　　了一天，得着絶愉快的精神安慰，就是在外邊受着些剌激，或胸中有些鬱勃氣，到此時自會無形的消滅，但年來黄金之國丨美利堅丨也感着不景氣的潮流，生産過剩，失業的很多，那些失業的男子，無聊頽喪地，終日蟄伏在家裏，婦人們覺得丈夫終日在家，非但不足以增進愛情，反有起着裂痕可能性，因爲穠蜜難常，談笑資料，也容易窮盡，且無聊時，心緒必定異常惡劣，心緒惡劣了，覺得無論什麽事物，都足生憎惹厭，那麽雙方很容易勃谿口角，與其愛情到此破裂，不如及早設法維持的好，所以美國的婦人會，曾把這個問題，周詳討論，結果定着一神聖的規條，凡是失業的男子，不准終日在家消磨時刻，仍舊須九點前外出，四時後始得回來，所以那些失業的男子，大都鎭日價躱在鄉村中的小咖啡店裏，唱着歌兒，用以發洩他們的悲哀，有時帶了幾塊粗麵包，跑到山巓水涯去，怔一回，呆一回；表演他瘋人的藝術，這眞可憐極了！</p>

<p>他老遠的看到老姑娘在這裏，心裏如有所望，大槪已是不生氣了，因之走回他自己大門口的時候，他也就手扶着帽簷，遙遙的點上一個頭。這也不知是何緣故，積之這樣很平常的和他點了一個頭，他心裏就快活得什麽似的比平空得了一樣什麽東西，還要歡喜多少倍。有七八天的工夫，無論作什麽都不高興，這也就是高興了。又過了一天，積之在回家路中，頂頭就遇到了桂枝，桂枝手上没有拿什麽，似乎不是買東西，而且這也就快到街的盡頭了，買東西，也用不着到這地方來。只見他頸上圍了一條破舊圍巾，兩手插在衣袋裏，縮做了一團。積之當面攔住他道：老姑娘，這樣天冷，那裏去？桂枝放出很不高興的樣子隨口答應了三個字道：買東西。積之笑着半鞠躬笑道：老姑娘，您還生氣啦。老姑娘淡淡的一笑道：二爺說這話，我們怎樣承受得起？我們是什麽人，敢生二爺的氣呢？積之嘆了一口氣道：這話也難說，你得原諒我一點，我現在是吃哥哥的飯，我怎能夠違抗我哥哥的命令呢？街那頭新開了一家乳茶店，他們是北京城裏來的，這街上人，他們還不大認識，我們去吃點什麽，順便談一談。街上怪冷的，你一點衣服不加，由屋子裏走出來，仔細着了凉。桂枝本來迎面走去的，說話，巳是情不自禁的，回轉身來走着，突然的答復積之道：我不冷！我不去！積之碰了這樣一個惡狠狠的釘子，還有什麽話說？兩手插在大衣袋裏，低了頭，在桂枝後跟了走。桂枝在前面走有二三十步路，便回頭看他一眼。他們若是回家去，到了一條斜街的交叉的所在，便應當轉彎，然而桂枝並不轉彎，只管朝前一直的去，這正是積之說着街那頭，新開有一家乳茶店的所在。（三九）</p>

<p>— 傳翼之</p>
<p>國立交通大學舉行工業及鐵道展覧會，上海各報均有詳細記載，轟動全國，盛極一時。予於廢暦淸明節，因休假之便，亦曾往參觀，琳瑯滿目，美不勝收，惜非工業專家，對於各種機器構造及其原理，有時雖經内部人員詳加指騐，尚多不能澈底了解，唯將感想所及，略舉如左：</p>
<p>（一）國貨汽車　提倡國貨，應從大處着想，年來國内商界鉅子，頗有志於國貨事業，惟其自乘汽車及流通國貨所需要之運輪汽車，無一不從國外購入，似非根本之圖，僅瀋陽迫擊砲廠苦心研究，始製成載重汽車若干輛，方謂國貨汽車，從此可以大批出貨，不必完全仰給外人，不圖九一八之役，該廠被燬，所有自製載重汽車，悉被暴日刦去，獨此運至全國道路協會陳列之一輛，今日得再陳列於工鐵展覽會，而不復聞有同樣之國貨汽車問世，睹此僥倖僅存之遺物，能不感慨而欷歔！</p>
<p>（二）抽水機年來都市人口，日益增加，唯一原因，則在農村經濟破産，農民不能自給，不得不向都市中尋求生活；但農村經濟之所以破産，不外水旱兵災，以及農具種子之不加改良。予生長畎畝，深知此中情形，例如歲逢大旱，除以手舞足踏之水車，吸引少量之水，以資灌漑外，惟有仰天乞霖。該會有中華鐵工廠及震旦鐵工廠所陳列之抽水機，據云灌溉田畝，百倍於人工戽水，予以參觀者，係一部四匹馬力之抽水機，價約百餘元，惜其在旁招待者，似爲一工人，每分鐘能吸收水量若干加侖，以及能否吸收地位低下之水至長距離地位頗高之處，渠亦含糊答覆，以致不能深知其效用。倘能如吾人理想所及，則其裨益於救旱者非鮮，尚望從事於農村事業者注意及之，亦挽救農村經濟之一法也。</p>
<p>（三）各省公路比較參觀全國道路成績展覽部份，内有各省公路比較圖表，以紅線表示已成公路，綠線表示計劃建設尚未完成者，紅綠線之長，以廣東爲最，以江西殿後，因思交通便利，與文化發達成一正比，而與土匪猖獗，則成一反比，江西匪禍，蔓延無已，其以此歟，予爲江西人，對兹不禁惶愧，猶憶一二八之役，敵人增援，捷如神兵，我則由贛南調援，轉道浙衢，步行一月，始達滬杭間，於此尤不能不望當局積極完成全國公路，以爲對外之一助　　（四）其他該會所陳列者，大半爲機器工業，如英文排字機，祗需一人打字，便能自動澆成若干所需要之字，較之人工排字，節省時間，何啻倍屣，此外，如電動機，變壓器，各式火車頭等，莫不偉大巧妙，惜皆外國機器廠家出品，我國實望塵莫及，甚望國人急起直追，實業救國之說，庶不致成爲空談！</p>

<h3 id="c189">﹁殺錯了人﹂異議 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>看了曹聚仁先生的一篇﹁殺錯了人﹂，覺得很痛快，但往回一想，又覺得有些還不免是憤激之談了，所以想提出幾句異議丨</p>
<p>袁世凱在辛亥革命之後，大殺黨人，從袁世凱那方面看來，是一點没有殺錯的，因爲他正是一個假革命的反革命者。</p>
<p>錯的是革命者受了騙，以爲他眞是一個筋斗，從北洋大臣變了革命家了，於是引爲同調，流了大家的血，將他浮上總統的寶位去。到二次革命時，表面上好像他又是一個筋斗，從﹁國民公僕﹂變了吸血魔王似的，其實不然，他不過又顯了本相。</p>
<p>於是殺，殺，殺。北京城裏，連飯店客棧中，都滿佈了偵探；還有﹁軍政執法處，﹂只見受了嫌疑而被捕的靑年送進去，却從不見他們活着走出來；還有，﹁政府公報﹂上，是天天看見黨人脫黨的廣告，說是先前爲友人所拉，誤入該黨，現在自知迷謬，從此脫離，要洗心革面的做好人了。</p>
<p>不久就證明了袁世凱殺人的没有殺錯，他要做皇帝了。</p>
<p>這事情，一轉眼竟已經是二十年，現在二十來歲的靑年，那時還在吸奶，時光是多麽飛快呵。</p>
<p>但是，袁世凱自己要做皇帝，爲什麽留下他眞正對頭的舊皇帝呢？這無須多議論，只要看現在的軍閥混戰就知道。他們打得你死我活，好像不共戴天似的，但到後來，只要一個﹁下野﹂了，也就會客客氣氣的，然而對於革命者呢，即使没有打過仗，也决不肯放過一個。他們知道得很淸楚。</p>
<p>所以我想，中國革命的閙成這模樣，並不是因爲他們﹁殺錯了人﹂，倒是因爲我們看錯了人。</p>
<p>臨末，對於﹁多殺中年以上的人﹂的主張，我也有一點異議，但因爲自己早在﹁中年以上﹂了，爲避免嫌疑起見，只將眼睛看着地面罷。</p>
<p>釣臺與西臺</p>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>富春江上的嚴子陵釣臺，近來走了桃花運，大爲摩登仕女所靑睞；許多上海聞人特地到七里瀧去拜訪牠。山崖很高，山路極狹，從山脚爬到山頂，渾身臭汗；幾間破屋，幾塊破碑，全没有什麽好看，於是廢然而返，以爲﹁嘸啥道理﹂。看﹁風雅﹂的面上，不能說出苦來：范文正先生到過的地方，我也到過，這就值得了，於是有詩爲證。</p>
<p>遊釣臺的人，大都善於研究的：這麽高的臺，嚴先生當時怎樣釣的呢？大家研究釣竿多麽長，釣線多麽長，也許討論到每日能釣幾尾之類。他們把嚴先生當作幽默釣魚家，替他想了許多美趣的釣魚法。而范嘩不做美，後漢書上偏說：﹁有一男子，披羊裘，釣澤中。﹂太没有詩意了！太没有詩意了！</p>
<p>和釣臺相接連的，另有一處危崖。杜撰考古家，說是姜太公釣魚臺：往來七里瀧的過客，十有九是姜太公黨，擁護這一說。他們說：﹁潯陽江上的鱸魚就是七里瀧的種；有一天，姜太公釣了一尾鱸魚，用力一甩，甩脫了鈎，飛到潯陽江裏去了。﹂那尾鱸魚，大槪是懷了孕的太太。據我所知，那是南宋末謝臯羽擊筑痛哭的西臺，有西臺慟哭記，記載這一段亡國痛事。</p>
<p>謝臯羽自然不能叨得上海聞人的歡心的；亡了國算得什麽，一樣地可以舒心享樂，到這樣山明水秀的境地來擊筑痛哭，那就是天下第一等傻子。所以南宋離開現在只有六七百年，早在人們的記憶上消失；而二千年前的風雅祖師，倒爲千百年後人所記掛，近來居然交了桃花運。可見做古人也要識相知趣爲妙。富春景色，南朝人就在那里贊不絶口。吳均與宋元思書，﹁風烟俱凈，天山共色，從流飄蕩，任意東西，自富陽至桐廬，一百許里，奇山異水，天下獨絶。﹂這是多麽令人嚮往的去處。微雨，濃霧，新月，黎明，此中况味，披羊裘釣澤中的男子，他懂得而且亨受得眞多了！無奈我們生不逢辰，正當登西臺擊筑痛哭的時候，還不能讓我們﹁從流飄蕩，任意東西﹂呢！</p>
<p>舞</p>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>放着白光的電燈懶洋洋地熄滅了。摩登的天花板裏，漏下了誘惑性的黯澹的光。這光是那麽地使人恍惚和迷離。跟着這光散佈在空間的，是流行的Ｆox-trot舞的音樂。於是一個個獻媚又得意的男子，用了交際場裏最時髦的姿勢，走向那些舞女。兩個兩個的靑年男女在閃光的地板上旋轉，臉上浮着輕蕩的微笑。</p>
<p>他坐着。眼光在這些旋轉的人們中跳動。看着聽着，他把呼吸也壓得慢慢的，因爲他要壓住自己的心跳。記得第一次跟老黄到舞場的時候，也是那麽心跳得慌，他說這樣肉感的誘惑是覺得討厭的，那時老黄還笑他迂氣太重。好事的朋友們，高興起來就强逼他學，讀書很聰明的他，在這方面也很聰明，朋友們敎了他幾次，已經跳得很可過了。今夜老黄不知道從那裏來了興致，又拉他一道去。他可又是那麽樣心跳起來了。一陣陣的香氣，一個個的半裸的肉體，扭着各種姿式的曲線，使他每根神經都微微地顫動。他苦笑着。看看老黄擁着一個短小的舞女，熟練地跟音樂的節奏移動脚步。老黄的臉上浮着貪婪的笑，别的男子的臉，一大半也有這貪婪的微笑的。他感到一種難堪的厭惡，音樂可就在這時候靜了下去。</p>
<p>老黄喝了一口茶，把得意的眼望他。﹁你來一次吧，剛才地個穿紅衣服的舞得很好。﹂</p>
<p>他苦笑着。</p>
<p>﹁又要迂了嗎？有什麽要緊的？﹂老黄說着一壁就得意地笑。再想往下說的話，給音樂阻止了。老黄又跟音樂走了去。天花板裏洒下的光，從淡綠變成淺紫了。</p>
<p>空氣越發濃馥起來，並且還攙着濃烈的香檳的味兒。酒的陶醉，肉的陶醉，把那些貪婪的臉抹上了一層紅暈。可是他的情緒，却慢慢地平靜了下去。又一次音樂響了的時候，他也跟别人一樣地走到一個舞女的面前。她披着給上等理髮匠熨　過了的長髮，薄紗的衣服蓋着她匀稱的肉體。他下意識地動着步兒，他的心又下意識地跳了，現在他看明白了常常裝着嬌柔的臉蛋，在脂粉底下隠隠地有一層灰暗的皺紋，迷惘的眼睛含着黯澹的苦笑，都市的輪齒把她噬成這個模樣了。</p>
<p>﹁啊啊，歡樂的背後，就閃現着這樣的苦笑嗎？﹂他在心裏說。跟着懶洋洋地靜下去的音樂，他低下頭，回到原來的座位。</p>
<p>天花板裏又漏出嬌紅的燈光了。</p>
<p>人生哲學</p>
<p>— 伯苻</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我們的一生，就好像坐在哥侖布的船裏一樣。出發的時候，不知道究竟到那裏去。到了的時候，不知道我們是在的什麽地方。及至回來的時候，又不知道我們曾經到過的是什麽處所。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>假若你遇着一個比你更爲偉大的人時，你可以斷定他有兩個地方，比你偉大。即是他比你更會說假話，他比你更是個渾帳東西！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>一切愛人，必然都是些理論家，因爲他們說的話，狠少見諸實行。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>你若會着一個生人的時候，你不要問他是誰人，你應該問的，是他是誰的人！</p>
<p>花會</p>
<p>— 李</p>
<p>﹁扳掛裁在方茂林，太平盛世徐元貴，逢春得時朱光明，火官煉成林艮玉······﹂莫說他鄉瓜頭兒，五六歲的小巴戲使能把花會歌訣背得爛熟。﹁可惜，好好的一個張火官，疑心不决，巴巴地脫去了！﹂</p>
<p>﹁還待講，昨晚夢着火燒房屋，多靈騐，偏生去打李明珠，火鷄不打打蛤蜊，這是那裏說起？﹂十村有八村閒聚着些男女，淸早起來就譚夢，中午等消息，下午議論着花會經，晚上又男女雜沓底到荒廟墳堆去祈夢。也有盜了菩薩，拾了尸骨，做稱呀蒸呀的巴戲的。</p>
<p>人是七分鬼相，鬼話連篇地滿心是發横財的底主意。個個都是財迷傳中角色，那裏還有些人氣？奇聞迭出，財迷心竅的割自己兒子的頭，斬親女兒手臂去打花會的成了時常被傳說的尋常事。</p>
<p>天天開出，一個賠三十個，又簡捷，又有厚利，難怪風靡鄉里，老少踴躍。以﹁支那通﹂著稱於日本的浪人井上紅梅，曾以酒，麻雀，阿片，這三種特産來像徵中國，著了厚厚的一本書，大言炎炎的告訴日本人。這位寶貝跑到中國來，大嫖大賭，專一軋流氓，姘野雞，勾結痞棍，在下流社會鬼混了一陣子，便以爲中國是如此這般的一個國家。當初，我看了那册東西，心中着實嘔氣。然而嘔氣了又怎麽樣呢？不單是都市裏的小市民墮落不堪，現在率性連鄉村的農夫農婦也都學會投機取巧，大家具着冒險僥倖的心腸。酒，麻雀，阿片之國的稱號已名副其實。衰老到了這步田地的民族，那裏還有復興之望呢！</p>
<p>長篇創作</p>
<p>時代與愛的歧路</p>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>﹁萬一在下半天參加示肆游行，給帝國主義者的走狗捉了去時，那麽，自己對於異性，完全没有半點的經騐﹂。</p>
<p>這樣的自暴自棄的念頭更促進了他對她的有示。他感着自己週身發熱了。他此刻攬住了她的頸項了。</p>
<p>﹁林先生！······﹂</p>
<p>她只是傻笑。她的身體像要軟癱下去了。當他看見她　着雙唇向他表示時，他就像餓　捕小雀兒一樣地把她緊緊地摟住了。</p>
<p>他過後也覺得和異性接吻並不是怎樣有味。他似乎還聞着她的涎沫的腥味。他想，莫非她在今早上吃了罐頭沙丁魚。</p>
<p>三十三</p>
<p>趕到唐耀星庽裏來時，十二點又過了一刻，他看見耀星房裏只坐着一個頭上戴鴨舌帽，身上穿靑布長衫，臉色蒼白的靑年。滿室冷淸淸的，不像是羣集會的所在。海泉向那位靑年招呼了一下，也不會請敎他的姓名，便大模大樣地在唐耀星的床沿上坐下來。</p>
<p>﹁老唐到那裏去了呢？﹂</p>
<p>海泉一半似問那個靑年，一半似對自己說。</p>
<p>﹁等一刻就回來。﹂</p>
<p>那位靑年却很爽快地回答了他。</p>
<p>果然，過了一刻，唐耀星回來了。他一看見了海泉，便好神氣的向海泉責問。</p>
<p>﹁你怎麽不守紀律？﹂</p>
<p>﹁我不是來了？﹂</p>
<p>海泉涎着笑臉回答。最初，他只當耀星和他說笑的，但望了望耀星的蒼白臉上的嚴冷的神色，還没有一些鬆動，他便歛了笑容，但心裏却抱了一點反感。</p>
<p>﹁呌你十二點到這裏來，怎麽不守時刻？﹂</p>

<p>— 牛</p>
<p>可笑張學良臨去的幾句話</p>
<p>張學良先生，於前晚巳經登輪出國去了，國府要人送行的也不少，我們也應該登輪去歡送一番，國府要人們歡送，是表示國府的意思，我們前去歡送，是表示一般老百姓的意思，</p>
<p>張學良是一個世襲的關外王，他在﹁不抵抗主義﹂之下，無事端端把關外四省之地，完全送掉，現在安安逸逸到意國去了，還算好，他没有把平津一齊送掉了走，總算他的識相處，但是張先生﹁我的就是你的，你的就是我的﹂的精神，我們實在佩服得很，不但我們中國人佩服，就是外國人亦多佩服，曾見某西報載，應該替張氏鑄一銅像，以爲世界和平之神，所以張少帥這次出國，我想必定也要受外人轟轟烈烈一番歡迎禮呢，</p>
<p>但張先生過去偉大的事跡，大家也通通知道了，即恭維張先生的文字，也總算不少了，我也不來畫蛇添足，再去恭維幾句，但此次出國，還有兩篇賬，應該請張先生弄淸楚了再走，</p>
<p>一，張學良前在北平臨行時，擅將海部天津醫院校址，全部地皮房屋，越權售與該醫院醫校所在地之法租界當局，經海部覺察後，曾迭電張氏阻止，均未得有張氏覆音，</p>
<p>一，張繼八日電吳市長，謂閱報張學良將乘船出國，頤和園銅器，雖已南遷，但該園古字畫，多在張學良手，宜從速檢出扣留，庶國寶不致流亡海外云云，</p>
<p>以上兩件事，非但張學良應該弄淸爽了再走，就在政府也應該使張學良弄弄淸楚，然後讓他出國，因爲（一）該校地址，已被法租界當局，率領法籍兵警，將該院校之全部房屋，硬行佔去，海部除已分别呈請最高軍事當局及政院，向法方提起交涉外，國府應將此類淆亂管轄系統，越權盜賣之不法契約取消，並治張學良以越權盜賣國有地産與外人之罪，此事若不弄好，倘日後引起中法兩國重大交涉，又是張學良先生所闖的禍根，又是張學良先生所賜的一件大功績，（二）電中所云頤和園字畫，但不知頤和園書究有若干，張學良先生也應該表示一個明白，究竟拿去頤和園的書畫，共有若干件，倘然没有表示，以後萬一有不肖之徒，與張先生一樣，大家多要推在你張先生頭上，到那時你也有口難分了，這是張氏所應當表明的，再從國府方面着想，也應該使張學良弄淸楚了這件事，才許他出國，因爲這多是我國的國賣，並非私人的財産，萬一缺少，人民應該有權替政府算賬，故此種國賣，政府决不應讓張學良私自拿去，并且據張繼電云，銅器雖已南遷，書畫多在他手，倘小民無知，發生誤會，謂這明明是分贓式的行爲，硬的重的我來，軟的輕的你去，這是一種妥洽合作的舉動</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>，政府將如何解說，就照這樣兩點看來，政府也决不該讓張學良將書畫帶走，　　天然，豺狼當道，安問狐狸，張學良辱國喪地之罪，尚且不究，區區古字古畫，校地房産，還要問他則甚，在政府法網宏開，民胞物與，眞是古今所未聞，中外所罕見，不過這樣一來，大家去效法張學良先生，有地大家送，有物大家拿，旣有先例可援，大家不妨則效，試問如此國家，還成什麽樣子，我並非對張氏不滿，實爲國家可惜，</p>
<p>還可笑得很，張學良臨行時，還有所謂談話式的表示，謂﹁余雖辭職出國，不問軍政，然爲國民一份子，對内對外，均有天職，不久仍將歸國，以盡厥責﹂云云，試問，諸位讀者想想，這幾句話，配不配張學良說的，張氏身居要職多年，把我國四省之地，完全送掉，試問天職在那裏，是否居官不必盡其天職，而爲國民一份子方能盡其天職麽？又云，不久回國，以盡厥職，是否以前不必盡職，必須出國以後，方能盡職麽？啊！我知道了，張先生所謂天職，所謂盡職，就是送地之職，私自盜賣校産與竊物的職，張先生的天職也算盡的夠了，以後請不必再來費心罷，</p>

<p>展開報紙一看，那末死於各種不同方式中的社會新聞，眞是差不多每天都有記載着；其實在另一般人看去，僅如死了條狗子一樣的平凡！</p>
<p>﹁啊呀！了不得，要輾死了？﹂</p>
<p>在住屋的弄口，我正在徘徊的時候，乘着自由車那個送牛奶者，這時恰和一輛風馳電掣而來的摩托客碰了個滿懷。不消說，牛奶，瓶子，一古腦兒充作犧牲品外，於是我眼前剌進了一個白髮老者，横倒地面上，使勁地打着滾，嘴巴吐出若斷若接的痛呌聲！自由車出像呆默的向　老人出神。便緊圍着許多旁觀的人頭。</p>
<p>﹁喂，朋友，你依舊痛個不住嗎？﹂汽車夫了解現實世界裏，唯有靠着强權的一　，反正强權就是公理；於是他勇氣交關的繼着說：﹁哈哈，哭甚麽呢？總算還好哩　虧得没把車廂的玻璃撞碎；要是碎了一扇的話，看你也不像賠得起的人，至少須十兩銀子一塊，你知道這種玻璃眞正的外國來路貨哩。﹂</p>
<p>﹁呀···唷···痛煞哉！痛·····﹂老者是不停的把手按住口角流出的鮮血，痛呌直跳。</p>
<p>﹁唔！只是你煞有道理？看，他在流血！狂哭的聲音，你却好像個没有聽得嗎？唉，撞壞了人，還要倔强？﹂憤慨萬分的我，我這樣和汽車夫﹁敎訓﹂了他幾句，也許下次開車他才會留心的緣故，但，結果他倒放出一付所謂﹁白相人﹂的鋼骨架子來！</p>
<p>﹁先生，儂勿要凶來兮，阿拉開車念多年，這種小事，哼！有啥關係？﹂﹁那末你甚麽不撳喇叭呢？這裏是弄堂口，你知道嗎？﹂</p>
<p>﹁嘿嘿，不撳喇叭？﹂他冷刺刺的說道：﹁啥希奇，阿拉東家外國人，照樣在﹁馬路當中﹂也可不損喇叭，何况像你﹂</p>
<p>﹁喔？當眞你還想托庇外國人來强辭奪理　你這亡國奴丨丨你們諸位看他的態度何等地驕傲啊！﹂</p>
<p>﹁嚇死我也，牙齒生生的把它撞掉了，三隻，三隻丨衣服也撕破完了。﹂</p>
<p>﹁眞可恨，拖他到××里去。﹂</p>
<p>﹁唷唷，陸阿巧，勿，我不贊成，××是甚麽一回事？說不定老人家倒霉也會罰錢，我說呌汽車夫賠些錢送他醫院裏去罷。﹂一夥人如上的議論紛紛。</p>
<p>凡事都是如此，天大的事總會有個了結，不久，這裏便大家走散，只有那堆鮮血到還是通紅！但是一會淸道夫來打掃乾凈，也就會永遠不留痕跡的了。</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>我是一個弱而無見識的女子：在七歲時候，我的父親就背我母女而故世。此後生活非常困難；幸有我的舅父，依靠過活。我現在已有二十三歲。在十七歲的時候，本在滬上某中學讀書；我的舅父雖然慷慨，給我學費讀書，然而性情非常固執，以爲我是很長大，滬上又是混濁之地，女子有了一些普通程度，在社會上就可以立足，何必再求深造呢？我因此就輟學了。後來由我舅父的友人朱君，介紹至書局充售貨員之職，就得識一位同事王君。王君學識非常豐富，品行尚稱不惡，所以我時往請敎；而王君亦兢兢敎導不以爲厭。日久就由友誼而彼此了解。王君尚未娶妻，屢次向余求婚。我以爲王君非常誠實，終身有靠；商之母親，亦以爲然，就此口訂白首之约，融融樂樂，熱情達於沸點。我的意志很是薄弱的，就由戀愛而發生肉體關係。後來我屢次催其早日結婚，實行同居之樂；王君因限於經濟，以致延遲，誰知一二八事變的結果，該書局因之關閉我與王君亦不得不分離；但是我們仍是時通魚雁。最近三個月，王君忽變常態，停止信札，我給伊信，他也不覆；後來再三探聽，始知他違背前盟，另與鄭女士訂婚，已於上月十二日結婚了。我聞悉之下，心如刀割；前往理論，則推稱父母之命，不可辭却；後再前往，他竟避不見面，使我兩行熱涙，祇有在枕上流着。後被我舅父知道了，時來責問，我有何面目可以回答呢？今王君用誘拐的手段，來引誘我，以致失身，最後中途放棄，使我後顧茫茫。我是一個弱女子，何能對付他呢？倘然就此了事，我一口的寃氣，何能嚥下去呢？惟有趨於自殺之途，但是自殺是卑鄙的，無用的。以法律解决嗎？但是口頭之約，無憑無據，違背婚約，以及理婚等罪，未知可能成立否？爲特懇請先生開一光明大道，代爲解决。想先生熱心社會，定蒙賜敎也。專肅即請撰安。盧坤貞謹上。</p>
<p>編者按：讀了盧女士的來信，我們覺得那個姓王的東西，實在罪大惡極；始亂終棄，不但置盧女士於何地，並且把整個的女性，侮辱到怎樣地步呢？要是就此這樣輕輕放過，不但盧女士這一口寃氣，嚥不下去；爲了整個女性的安全起見，我們也覺得不平。</p>
<p>﹁雞皮貼不上鴨身﹂，交涉的結果，决不能使盧女士重享美滿的樂境；或者在這種頑固的社會裏，張揚的結果，反有不利於盧女士，我們也知道的。但是盧女士一人的犧牲，究是小事，何况她已經是着了創痕的人呢。所以我們還希望盧女士把業已被蹂躪的小已，爲了整</p>
<p>個女性的前途，同這人面獸心的東西，拚一個你死我活。下面是兩個辦法：</p>
<p>現在的世界，名義上是進步了，不許你私自復仇。你應當向法院控告，至少辦上他一個﹁使人誤信有夫婦關係，而聽其姦淫﹂的罪名。判上三年或四年的徒刑。</p>
<p>因爲這世界的進步，不過是名義上罷了；控告的結果，不一定能夠圓滿。那時是社會負你，你應當起來行使﹁自救權﹂。捉一個機會，與他白刃相見。爲了要吐這一口寃氣，爲了要替整個女性吐氣，什麽犧牲都值得的。</p>

<p>蘇俄新來的幾張片子，標榜着﹁這裏没有大腿，不用肉感﹂的口號，居然在這國難期間，人們耳目昏昏欲睡的當兒，來了一劑强心針，似乎感到異樣的剌激。一張片子没有大腿，或是連女人都没有，還可以辦得到，但是一個女子，没有一對有樣子的，帶神秘性的，撩人情緒的大腿，是不興的，尤其是在好萊塢。大腿的藝術“Legart”是初進的女星們所必須具的，因爲她們初進的時候，人家所看得到的，祇有她們的一雙大腿，至於她們有無表演的天才，那還是第二步。這是好萊塢的金科玉律，没有人能夠打倒的。現在一般已經成名的女星，如琪恩哈羅，瑪琳蒂德麗許，瓊克勞馥，海倫黛德麗，克萊拉寳，耐姗卡珞兒，愛立斯掣德，開弗蘭西斯等等，都已經過這一層階級。到現在她們還不能放棄她們的看家本領，時時還要顯露顯露，可見一雙玉腿在女人身上，旣佔了過半以上的地位，當然係很重要的了。</p>
<p>瑪琳蒂德麗許，平常穿了男人的袴子，將那一雙纖穠適中，修短合度的大腿掩蓋起來了，多少影迷們爲她惋惜。瑪麗璧克馥，亦歡喜著男子裝，使大腿有欲出不得之嘆。但她們是已經靠大腿而成名，儘管這樣做，而所進的女星，是没有人敢跳出此範圍而不靠大腿成名的。現在聽說好萊塢有一位新進的女星，聲明要打破好萊塢的﹁陋規﹂，不靠大腿的肉感，而要在表演天才上成名。她的富有革命精神的壯舉，將來能否成就，尚在未定之天，可是她進取之難，恐怕十倍於别人了。</p>
<p>﹁大腿的藝術﹂，亦是照相家的一種特别本領。每一個新進的女星，在簽訂合同之後，就立即被引導到一間照相室裏，將她身體的各部份，都拍成各式各樣的照片。一則爲使導演先生决定她在影片中的身段態度，應當如何拍攝，二則這種照片，可以散佈給各報訪員作爲一最好的宣傳品。當然，大腿的照片是報紙最歡迎的了。而照相師拍照的時候，亦必須大運其匠心，大腿稍肥稍瘦，均可運用地位方向以及燈光的布置，攝後的修飾等等，使她們（大腿）成爲十全十美。這亦是﹁大腿的藝術﹂之一種。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c217">再談﹁故劍難忘﹂ <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>最近國泰兩次所映的影片，都是純粹的戀愛劇。牠們的體裁都還好，常常顯示着相當的﹁理智﹂和﹁情義﹂，也許還帶了一部份的﹁倫理﹂。很明顯的，這是美國編劇者思想的進步，他們巳經覺悟已往攝些﹁金錢﹂﹁肉慾﹂等盲目戀愛劇的錯誤。</p>
<p>這張﹁故劍難忘﹂的故事，是四角戀愛的開始，却以三角戀愛來結束，像這樣的似完非完，固然容易引起一部份觀衆的不快。其實這樣的收尾，正平添許多詩意，增加多不少的回味。</p>
<p>劇旨方面，没有甚麽可談的，反正導演和編劇總算很聰明。在全片展開以前，和Ending以後，當然應當有許多是可以放在正劇裏的，但是我們知道這是不容易的工作。所以他們爽快地截去首尾，成一詩化作品。從少年夫妻不和起始，到他後夫離美爲止，其中關於少年夫妻怎樣的結合，爲甚麽不和，以及後來兩男一女的結局怎樣，都一槪不演出來。的確，若演出來，一個不小心，就會與原劇矛盾，鑄成大錯的。所以與其贊揚他們手腕高妙，思想脫俗，母寗說他們善於取巧。不過就藝術而論，這種取巧是有功於的，善意的。</p>
<p>談到技術，黄金國的影片，對於攝影，光線，佈景，收音等一切，都能永久保持着世界最高的榮譽，這張影片，又何致於例外？剪接也良好，内中雖然略有脫節，但尚非甚麽大疵點。對白雖多了一些，不過牠是一張减頭去尾的影片，對白倘若再少，更呌人莫明其妙。</p>

<p>— 培元</p>
<p>前天（七日。本刊載登黑客風君的大作：﹁白金龍﹂未通過一文。按此消息，確係傳聞之訛，蓋﹁白金龍﹂影片於六日在電影檢查會檢查，各委員因該片中對白，係滬粤兼有，委員等皆多江浙及别省之人氏，故對於片中粤語對白，致發生間隔，於是乃决定提出大會討論，并囑送檢者之天一公司，補呈該片對白及歌詞，以便明瞭，故白金龍之通過與否的問題，則須俟大會决定後方可證實也，然我們證諸明星公司之﹁失戀﹂影片，亦係滬粤并兼，而未遭電影檢查會之留難，則﹁白金龍﹂我想亦决不致被不通過也。</p>
<p>至於表演，也許是飾棄婦的露絲蔡透頓RuthChatterton從前在“LaugbingLady裏給我們印象太好了，所以這次我們覺得牠不及已往。不過在這裏，牠的輕描淡寫，却也極合身份，副主角勃脫代惟斯BattleDavis和喬治勃藍脫GeorgeBrent一個作活潑浪漫的靑年，一個作十足君子派的男人，都洽到好處。</p>

<p>據現在的事實來看，日本的東洋車較上海的黄包車還來得狹窄一點，兩人同坐勢所不容；卽使要坐，警察也要干涉。如果以體格魁梧的西洋人兩人同坐，那更是不可能。</p>

<p>－關於﹁蝴蝶夫人﹂與﹁亞洲風雲﹂</p>
<p>日前禮垣君在本刊提出了關於﹁蝶蝴夫人﹂的幾點意見，因爲編者要我答覆，所以乃盡我所知道答覆如左：</p>
<p>兩個人同坐一部人力車，在日本確是没有，而且西洋人亦决無此特權。當然這是該片的作者對於日本的風俗不甚了解之故。不獨如此，還有該片中主人呼下女，不稱名而稱姓（Suau）應爲日文之﹁鈴木﹂或﹁佐佐木﹂的音譯。也是不合日本習慣的。也許其中還有失愼的地方，可惜一時記不起來。</p>
<p>﹁評亞洲風雲﹂一文中，前一段有幾句完全排印得顛倒錯誤，現在爲了不致引起誤會起見，特就錯誤處憑記憶之所及，抄錄原稿數句如后：</p>
<p>﹁······其次本片曾經有一次被譯爲﹁國魂﹂，那是連内容也改製過了的，在後面還加上一面靑天白日的國旗。然而現在該不是﹁國魂﹂的復活吧。﹂</p>
<p>這是說被加上國旗的是從前的﹁國魂﹂，而不是現在的﹁亞洲風雲﹂了。</p>

<p>時間是一七六二年，在喀德璘第二CatherineTheSecond廢　俄皇彼得第三而自立爲帝之後。</p>
<p>道一位雄才大略的婦人，在起初，她爲了國家的命運，覺得昏懦無能的彼得第三，是不夠和土耳其，波蘭等强鄰周旋。等到登位之後，她運用了些才智，土耳其是被打敗了，波蘭也被瓜分了，然而她忽然感覺到莫可名狀的煩悶來。呀，空虚的煩悶，她祗覺得年靑貌美的奥洛夫伯爵是可愛！爲了這個原故，朝中充滿了仇視她與反對她的空氣，尤其是蕭伐洛夫伯爵，他是奥洛夫的仇人，對於奥洛夫的被寵幸，當然是有不少的怨懟與妒嫉。於是推翻喀德璘的詭計是進行着，暗殺奥洛夫的密謀是規劃着，宫中充滿了嚴肅的氣象，然而，在另一世界却又寂靜得可憐。</p>
<p>﹁噹，噹···噹！···﹂修道院裏的鐘聲，曳着拖長的音調，在那寂靜的空氣中，奏着冰冷的而又孤獨的悲哀；冷艶的波莤蒂公主，度着這樣凄凉的時日，她忘懷了這個熱閙的世界，辜負了她美麗的靑春，她，死心地在修道院裏誦經祈禱，有誰知道是她一個公主，有誰知道她是伊麗莎白彼得耀伐皇后的女兒呢！</p>
<p>雖然誰都不知道，但，失勢的蕭伐洛夫伯爵是例外的：因爲他知道了有這一個人，而且，曾經挾了滿懷的希望，竊竊地溜到修道院來，用了嚴肅的態度，懇熱的對波　蒂說，﹁你呀，你是伊麗莎白皇后的女兒，這全俄帝國都是屬於你的，起來呀，去把喀德璘打倒，我們是一致擁護你的。﹂但，波莤蒂的心，像古井裏的水一樣，他是不會重波的了！</p>
<p>喀德璘是一個足智多謀的婦人。她覺得國内人民對於自己的空氣，是異常的嚴重，而且，她和奥洛夫的事情，更不應該讓它變成公開的秘密，於是便把奥洛夫伯爵喚到宫中呌他帶丘到前線去征打土耳其：雖則她心裏有些難受，然而一想到自己地位的危險，便祇得含着涙兒和他相别。（未完）</p>

<p>丨製造精巧寛敞舒適丨</p>
<p>新雪鐵龍汽車之式樣種類。爲數頗多。若十匹馬力之雪鐵龍。即其一也。斯爲四汽缸式出品。持優搆製。彌極精巧。故已引起一般人之普徧注意。此種車輛。刻正由雪鐵龍廠大批趕造。以應世界各處之熱烈需求。記者爲求明瞭該項出品之詳細情形起見。近曾參加試車之舉。按此種出品。雖名爲雪鐵龍十匹馬力式。但一究其實際。則其寛敞宏偉。洵非尋常十匹馬力式所可望其項背。蓋其輪距竟達八尺十寸又四分之一。故其裝配之車身。自然彌臻寛宏。轎式車身。係以獨幅鋼料精工搆造而成。且更承以特别堅强之底盤架。是以倍極鞏固。彌經久用。雖以最高速度駕駛於陋劣不堪之路面。亦無軋軋作響之虞。雪鐵龍十匹馬力式新車之行駛。所以安靜無聲。蓋自有其種種原因。除上述一點外。其又一原因。厥爲引擎之特别墊架。考其實施之方法。乃完全以浮力原理爲根據。故引擎齒輪箱部份之重量。幾悉由橡皮絶緣之兩點担承之。按此兩點。一置齒輪箱後。又其一則以汽缸體之前方以置﹁Ａ﹂式横架支承之。此引擎整個部份。所以絶對安靜。臺無巓震。且不愧爲現代機械工程方面之一偉大進展與成功。</p>
<p>至具有無聲二擋齒輪之諧動齒輪箱。乃雪鐵龍十匹馬力式之又一顯著特色。蓋惟有此裝置。其調排乃殊更易。而雪鐵龍之得心應手。操縱自然。亦遂因此而爲當然之結果。此外如具有水壓吸震器之彈簧設備。亦爲其特色之犖犖大者。蓋以品質特優。效用彌宏。至足使駕駛乘坐者感受無上愉快舒適也。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍直匹馬力式新車之塞車系。簡便而效宏。其脚踏與手扳桿。均交聯於中心總横軸。此種塞車。動作旣極敏妙而自然。而其停車力之偉大儲積量。且更出色當行。逈不可及。四缸引擎爲旁列汽門式。口徑六八米。衝程一○○米。藉流行式之接合器而接連於諧動齒輪箱。鋼版車身。堅優卓絶。其少數接節處。焊合而爲一體。天衣無縫、宛同整幅。至所裝配之底盤架。則尤鞏固異常。是以相得益彰。彌極盡美盡善。要而言之。此種十匹馬力式之雪鐵龍新出品。不特遠優於尋常所謂十匹馬力汽車。且誠足爲汽車界闢一新元也。﹁敷﹂</p>

<p>汽車速率過高最足肇禍</p>
<p>走路不小心者亦易送命</p>
<p>一九三二年美國汽車肇禍之主因。大約有下例諸端。即開駛速率過度。在馬路錯誤之一邊行駛。及無通行權時通過之等。凡上述種種駕車者之動作。令去年美人之死於汽車下者一六○○○人。受傷者數逾五三五·○○○人。凡兹所述。均係美國旅行者保險公司所製統計分析之一、去年汽車肇禍事件統計七四五·三○○起、死亡者二九·○○○人。受傷者九○四·八○○人、又據其他統計。死於汽車下者爲二九·五○○人。</p>
<p>據美國旅行者保險公司所出之﹁若輩以文明呼吾人﹂小册子中載稱。汽車肇禍事件大致分爲九類。今以其肇禍事件之多寡、順次列表如次。</p>
<p>原　　因　　肇禍事件</p>
<p>超過速度限制　　　　　一五○·○五○無通行權　　　　　　　一四六·五○○在馬路錯誤之一邊行駛　　八一·一八○離開道路行駛　　　　　　六一·五九○不施記號或記號不當　　　五二·七七○搶　　走　　　　　　　　二四·六一○經過錯誤之一邊　　　　　一○·三四○轉灣或登山　　　　　　　　七·三五○經過停止之街車　　　　　　四·四一○　　該書中又稱。凡兹肇禍事件之發生。因駕駛者開行過速。誠屬難恕其咎。此外如背道而駛。輕率開車等等。均足以釀成慘案之發生。總之駕駛者之鹵莽從事。乃爲一切肇禍之起源。但此種駕駛者若不及時注意。將來亦必有身受其報之一日也。</p>
<p>今更述汽車肇禍之於路人若何。一九三二年路人因汽車肇禍而身死者計一二·七七○人。受傷者二六七·二八○人、其受禍情形大致若下、</p>

<p>(Beiping) Kaiping Dispatch: The enemy, using heavy forces to press our front and attack the high ground northeast of Longwang Temple, initiated a battle for that area. Two of our regiments repeatedly engaged in hand-to-hand combat to climb the high ground. Due to the enemy's overwhelming artillery, machine guns, and aerial bombardment, the two regiments suffered heavy casualties. The hand-to-hand combat continued into the night and was still raging at dawn yesterday. After 10:00 PM last night, the enemy advanced along the Changcheng (Great Wall) valley, infiltrating behind our Lengkou position. One of our regiments entered a state of fierce battle. Japanese troops, infiltrating from near Dalingzhaikou, were scattered east of Taipingzhai, attempting to disrupt our rear. Our troops are currently driving them out. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lengkou Battle Report: On the Madougou front, the enemy gradually increased troops and fierce fighting on the night of the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, the left flank was surrounded and fired upon from the Yingtaoyuan heights. Our troops suffered heavy casualties and retreated to the pre-determined positions at Xiaozhangzi and Qincahe. At Liujiakou, at dawn on the 10th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our Xuliukou and charged four or five times with four columns. The fighting was extremely intense. We killed many enemies with hand grenades, and the mountain gullies were filled with corpses. Fighting is still ongoing. At the front lines of Cayazikou, Sizhikou, and Baiyangyukou, the enemy simultaneously deployed multiple columns to launch a fierce attack before dawn on the 10th. The enemy's force attacking our Lengkou this time is estimated to be eight or nine thousand. Unable to break through the front, they are trying their best to outflank our rear from both wings. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 10th, the enemy army launched a general offensive on all the passes of the Great Wall. The battle at Lengkou was the fiercest, followed by Xifengkou. □□ personally went to the front to command. The □ Division and □ Division are in fierce battle with the enemy. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 11th, from morning to noon, twenty to thirty enemy aircraft heavily bombed Qian'an, Lulong, Haiyangzhen, and other places, causing great devastation. Many telegraph lines were bombed and severed. When the enemy dropped bombs on Qian'an on the morning of the 11th, traitors took the opportunity to cause disturbances in the city, and the people fled in panic. Fortunately, the army suppressed the unrest and restored order. The enemy at Shimenzhai attacked Liujiang on the morning of the 11th. After a fierce battle until noon, they were repelled by us. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>

If they are lucky enough to win, the Japanese can realize their plan to form a new puppet state. If they fail, the four northeastern provinces will all be under Japanese power, with Chinese killing Chinese, reaping the fisherman's profit.

<p>Clearly a Japanese Fabrication to Confuse International Public Opinion</p>
<p>German Newspaper Fell for the Trick, Will Be Instructed to Correct</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain German newspaper in Berlin reported that the National Government was preparing to abandon sovereignty over Manchuria in exchange for Japan giving up extraterritorial rights in China. It also claimed that Foreign Minister Luo Wengan had been in contact with Japanese officials in Shanghai regarding direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. A reporter, finding the report bizarre, visited diplomatic authorities to inquire about the truth. According to the authorities, the reports in the German newspaper are absurd and ridiculous and not worth a laugh. The National Government's foreign policy has been repeatedly announced to China and the world, believing that in the current situation, China can only urge the League of Nations to implement sanctions against Japan in accordance with the spirit of the League Covenant and General Assembly reports, and actively prepare militarily to resist Japan's unlimited aggression. There can be no direct negotiations until Japan first withdraws its troops and abolishes the puppet state of Manchuria. Only someone insane would exchange sovereignty over the eastern provinces for anything. As for the claim that Foreign Minister Luo was in contact with Japanese officials in Shanghai, not only has Luo not been to Shanghai for a long time, but there are also no representatives in Shanghai to contact. Such bizarre and absurd rumors must have been fabricated by the Japanese, as it is the Japanese's usual trick to provoke national feelings and confuse international public opinion. It is regrettable that the German newspaper did not investigate and spread the rumors, falling into the Japanese trap. It is heard that the authorities will instruct the newspaper to make corrections in order to rectify international public opinion. (Eleventh Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>If the War Can Be Extended to Early Summer</p>
<p>It Will Be More Advantageous to Our Side</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan told reporters that he caught a cold on the front line and his old back pain recurred. He is taking advantage of the current ceasefire to come to Tianjin for four or five days of rest. If the situation on the front line becomes urgent, he can return at any time. He is a military man and his responsibility is to defend against foreign invasion. With a strong enemy in front of us, he will not resign. His resignation as Chairman of Chahar was to focus on the work of resisting Japan. Now that there is no time to save the country, why argue for power? Currently, enemy and ourselves are still confronting each other on the Xifengkou front. There are only about a hundred enemy soldiers, who occasionally bomb our rear with aircraft. Our army has been reinforced to Xifengkou. The military situation in eastern Luan has improved. In the past, because our forces were weak, we planned to fight a decisive battle at Tanghe. Later, because the puppet army pressed closely, we largely reinforced and gradually recaptured Haiyangzhen, Liujiang, and other places. We are approaching Shimenzhai and will encircle the puppet army. The Japanese 16th Division plans to participate in the eastern Luan war, but in terms of troop strength, we still have the advantage. It is expected that if the enemy is determined to occupy eastern Luan, they will definitely concentrate their forces within ten days to determine a victory or defeat. If they continue to use puppet troops to harass, waiting for us to get tired and then launch a general offensive, we are also prepared and will not be taken advantage of. If the war can be extended to early summer, when the crops have grown, it will be difficult for the enemy to attack, and we will be at an advantage. Currently, we are actively reorganizing transportation to facilitate military operations. Song finally said that Tang Yulin sent him a telegram yesterday, roughly stating that he felt ashamed to the country for the loss of Chengde and is now leading his troops to concentrate in a certain place, awaiting orders to resist Japan.

It seems that his visit to Beiping this time does not have much meaning, because his main business tomorrow is to play a golf match.

<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on April 3 that it is a big question whether former Foreign Minister and Minister to China Kichisaburō Nomura will be loyal to the country on this trip to China, and his actions today at 3 o'clock are extremely inappropriate. Originally, he was a first-class figure in the diplomatic world, and he was also responsible for important diplomatic responsibilities in the past. The people expect a lot from him, so his actions must wait for the time to mature and then respond to the government's policy in order to live up to the people's public opinion. However, what time is it today that he rashly travels to China, and I really don't understand the overall situation very well. I have no choice but to blame his rash action. Moreover, how many people in the country eagerly hope that he will travel to China? In short, those in the court are in the court, and those in the opposition are in the opposition. The people should each act according to their duties and implement national policies according to the occasion. If the party forgets the party, the chaebol forgets the chaebol, and the knowledgeable forgets his knowledge, it can be a pity for Kichisaburō Nomura personally, and I hope that today's Japanese chaebols and knowledgeable people will not lack the understanding of the overall situation and act at will.</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Underlying Meaning of the Washington Conference Is <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>As the world economic panic becomes increasingly serious, the rulers of the capitalist powers, in the midst of the overall crisis, cannot but exhaust all their efforts to try their last struggle. Government dignitaries, government dignitaries, and party leaders are rushing about on their journeys, and their busy and chaotic situation is vividly depicted. The farcical drama in Geneva had to stop because the water and mountains were exhausted. The proposal for a Four-Power Agreement failed due to conflicting interests and ultimately miscarried. The center of capitalist internationalism suddenly shifted to Washington, D.C. As the American financial bourgeoisie is the authority of the entire bourgeoisie at present, the transfer of this center is almost inevitable and the principle has its reason.</p>
<p>That the Washington Conference cannot contribute to the current economic panic has been seen in the two previous reports in this newspaper. The main points of Roosevelt's plan are (1) fully reduce tariffs to encourage international trade, (2) gradually restore the gold standard to stabilize international exchange rates, and (3) raise prices to alleviate the current panic. In addition, the silver price issue is also under discussion. The proclaimed doctrine is the universal abandonment of nationalistic economic policies. The war debt issue, the Soviet Russian issue, and the Far East issue seem to be the exchange conditions for realizing the above plan. The current world economic panic is due to the unprecedented surge in productive forces. This huge productive force cannot be destroyed without a drastic world war. Before productive forces are destroyed, if production is still in a state of anarchy, then a slight increase in prices will instantly restore excess production. Even if tariffs are reduced, it will only be a temporary effect of a cardiac stimulant and can never cure the contradictions in the current mode of production. An increase in trade volume of 300 million yuan is likely to be a dream in vain. The abandonment of the gold standard is the revolutionary means of various countries against the US gold policy. The demand to restore the gold standard is tantamount to hoping that the countries that have abandoned the gold standard will automatically disarm. Whether it is possible is even more doubtful. Raising prices and the so-called silver price issue are even more empty and illusory, and it is difficult to see the facts. In short, nationalistic economics and nationalistic politics are the inevitable products of capitalism. The state is a group of private property systems. Before the private property system is eliminated, is it a possible fact to abolish the barriers of the state? Therefore, the so-called Washington Conference, even if it can pass several bills, is only a piece of paper. Once put into practice, there will be hesitations everywhere. As long as the congress of one country fails to approve the bill, then everything will become a bubble. I am afraid that its effect will be as good as Hoover's declaration of a moratorium on war debts, which can cause a sensation for a while but cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>However, the above remarks refer to the text of the meeting. Since the so-called Far East issue may become the exchange condition for realizing Roosevelt's plan, then the underlying meaning is indeed worthy of careful consideration. The Far East issue in the eyes of the powers is ultimately a matter of dividing spoils. Before the spoils are divided properly, they can uphold justice and speak righteously to win the sympathy of the world. Once the spoils are properly divided, they will trade and retreat, each getting what they want, and eat their words without shame. Since the representatives of various countries attending the meeting with high crowns each carry their own demands to the road due to the different interests, then what Japanese imperialism carries is the Far East issue, which is almost undoubtedly. Matsuoka's journey from Geneva to the United States also said that he would lobby the United States to place China under joint control. Sure enough, when the Washington Conference was singing high into the clouds, former US Assistant Secretary of State Castle had already made a separate footnote to the Stimson Doctrine, and former Director of the Far East Division of the Ministry of Commerce Aldrich publicly advocated that the three eastern provinces could be handed over to the rule of Japanese imperialism through the League of Nations. From the subtle clues, we cannot but believe that Matsuoka's lobbying has had some success, and the so-called Washington Conference may follow the League of Nations and become a knife and chopping board for dividing China, slaughtering weak sheep to quell the disputes of the pack of tigers, or it may be a move by the capitalist powers when they have no other choice. What is regrettable is that even if the flesh of the weak sheep is exhausted, it may still not be enough to fill the hungry stomachs of the pack of tigers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States' recognition of the Soviet Union suddenly heard of a stagnation, and it is also an obvious move to consider waiting for the British to reorganize the anti-Soviet front. In short, the Washington Conference is actually a grand event for the capitalist powers to reorganize their last defensive formation. The means it adopts will be nothing more than sacrificing weak and small nations on the one hand to alleviate internal contradictions, and on the other hand to use the joint anti-Soviet as a stimulant to invigorate the spirit. However, at the same time, what is presented in the newspapers is the anti-Japanese attitude of India, the celebration of the Soviet Union and Poland, and the feud between France and Italy. Therefore, this last struggle cannot but be judged to be ultimately a bubble.</p>

The meeting lasted for several hours before adjourning. The meeting will continue in the afternoon to discuss the proposals until the end. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>

There is also a saying that Liu will stay in Jiangxi to assist in military affairs and take on the original position of bandit suppression.

<p>"Absolutely no talk of resisting Japan before the bandits are completely suppressed, violators will be subjected to the most severe punishment."</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The full text of Chairman Chiang's speech to the provincial generals on the 10th is now revealed: Resisting Japan must begin with suppressing the bandits. Judging from the rise and fall of past dynasties, internal pacification must precede external resistance. Before the bandits are completely suppressed, there must be absolutely no talk of resisting Japan. Violators will be subject to the most severe punishment. All parties must concentrate their minds and efforts to eliminate the communist bandits in the shortest possible time. The key to suppressing bandits is to first rectify the mind. Wang Yangming's success in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi stemmed from this. Nothing is more grievous than the death of the heart. Internal and external troubles are not to be feared, but it is unfortunate that the hearts of the people are dead, which is truly cause for concern. To save the country, one must start by rectifying the mind. We must pay attention to this. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Inspects the situation in various counties</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 7:00 this morning, Han Fuqu convened a meeting of county and district chiefs in Changshan, including those from Changshan, Weixian, Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Jimo, Anqiu, Zhucheng, Linqu, Changle, Shouguang, Yidu, Linliu, Guangrao, Boxing, Putai, Gaoyuan, Huantai, Qingcheng, Zhangqiu, Qidong, Zouping, Zichuan, Boshan, Rizhao, and 24 other counties. Han reported on the simple meaning of the meeting, which was to seek peace and prosperity for the people. Subsequently, councilors Sha Yuebo and Yao Yijia, and division commander Cao Fulin gave speeches. The meeting continued in the afternoon, with speeches by Liang Shuming and Liang Zhonghua, director of the Rural Construction Research Institute, and Zhang Nanxian, former chairman of Zhejiang Province. Finally, Han gave further instructions. Those seeking redress crowded the streets, and each case was examined and decided on the spot, greatly pleasing the people. At 4:30, he returned to Zhoucun, where merchants and civilians lined the streets to welcome him. At 6:00, he returned to Jinan by special train, accompanied by Zhang Nanxian. They arrived in Jinan at 9:00, and various dignitaries greeted them at the station. Han spoke about his inspection of eight counties, saying that Gaoyuan was the best, but there was a common ailment: civil servants were unwilling to work hard, and the people were mostly lazy. Zhang Nanxian said that he came from the north to observe rural construction in Dingxian, Shenze, and Zouping. Shandong's Zouping was unmatched by other provinces. Furthermore, there were four trees as thick as arms growing on the roof of the Huantai Construction Bureau, and Han immediately dismissed its director. It was decided that the county and district chiefs of the entire province would be divided into seven districts, and Han would convene meetings in each district, with the next meeting being for the second district, with a total of 177 people. The remaining six districts would hold meetings and receive instructions in six locations: Liaocheng, Laiyang, Xianxian, Tai'an, Shanghe, and Juye. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Will Persuade the United States to Abandon the Stimson Doctrine</p>
<p>Hoping to Obtain Economic Assistance</p>
<p>Ishii's Name is Most Often Mentioned as Representative</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese delegation participating in the London World Economic Conference and the preliminary talks in Washington will depart for Washington in mid-May. Finance Minister Takahashi, Interior Minister Yamamoto, and Privy Councilor Ishii have all been mentioned as possible representatives. Takahashi and Yamamoto are unlikely to leave Japan, so Ishii is the most promising. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers Roosevelt's proposal for a preliminary meeting to be an excellent opportunity to break through its isolated diplomacy after withdrawing from the League of Nations. It held a ministry meeting yesterday afternoon to decide on the basic countermeasures as follows: (1) Regarding the World Economic Conference, the Japanese government considers it an important opportunity. Foreign Minister Uchida will report on the details of the process at the cabinet meeting on the 11th. The representative must be selected from among ministers. (2) Finance Minister Takahashi is the most suitable person to be the Japanese representative. If Takahashi firmly declines due to illness, he should not be forced to accept. However, the selection of the representative must be made by the cabinet to avoid political turmoil. (3) This meeting is for individual contacts. The Japanese representative's contact with Roosevelt is scheduled for late May, so there is plenty of time. The Japanese government must take this opportunity to explain to the US President the truth about Japan's policy towards Manchuria, persuade Roosevelt to abandon the Stimson Doctrine, and discuss the basic principles of the naval disarmament conference to be held in 1936. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry's intended representatives are Viscount Kikujiro Ishii or Baron Kijuro Shidehara, former Foreign Minister. Shidehara has succumbed to the military since the September 18th Incident and should have his talents re-employed at this opportunity. (11th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese cabinet held a cabinet meeting at 10:00 this morning, where Foreign Minister Uchida reported on the contents of the invitation to the World Economic Conference. Three items were discussed on the spot: (1) Attendance, yes or no; (2) Representative selection; (3) What are the countermeasures? For the first item, due to the current state of the Japanese economy's need for world cooperation and assistance, and as it is the only opportunity to cooperate with the world after withdrawing from the League of Nations, it was decided to participate. As for the representatives and the outline of policy towards China, it was entrusted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle, and then a meeting of the five ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, and Colonial Affairs will be held to formulate principles and select several plenipotentiary representatives, which will then be submitted to the cabinet for approval, and finally Foreign Minister Uchida will reply to the US State Department. (11th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese financial community believes that the Washington preliminary meeting is crucial to Japan's future. The economic foundation for invading China after the September 18th Incident cannot be established without foreign capital. Given the current diplomatic situation, it is impossible to seek help from foreign countries. Therefore, many influential figures in the financial community advocate taking the opportunity to send representatives to the United States to seek Roosevelt's understanding. If the United States is willing to assist Japan, its policy towards Manchuria will not fail, and the domestic economy can also escape from a dangerous environment. The proposed representatives from the financial community are rumored to be Kenkichi Kagemi, representative of the Mitsubishi zaibatsu, or Baron Seinosuke Gō, representative of the Mitsui zaibatsu, but neither has formally agreed.

<p>(Nanjing) US President Roosevelt invited political leaders from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, China, Japan, and Mexico to Washington to discuss plans for the revival of the world economy. Although it does not take the form of a conference, the scope of the discussions, in addition to plans for the revival of the world economy, will also include an exchange of views on disarmament and the Far East issue, which is sufficient to influence the future global situation. Our government has now decided to send Song Ziwen to participate, and has telegraphed Shanghai to seek Song's agreement. When Song served as acting premier, he expressed his willingness to participate in the World Economic Conference. This time, he will certainly agree. The Central Political Conference may pass it on the 12th. If Song is willing to go abroad, he can also go to England in the future to participate in the World Economic Conference on June 15, which will take about three months.

<p>(Washington) Economic talks will be held separately here. Japan has decided to send representatives to participate. It is reported that the State Department does not want to mention the Far East issue to the Japanese representatives. The reason is that the US government's invitation to China did not include the Far East issue. If opinions are exchanged with the Japanese representatives while disregarding China, it would be biased, which the State Department does not want to do. However, if there are any changes in the status quo in the Far East, they cannot be discussed without China's participation, as China is one of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty. As for President Roosevelt's intention, all international issues should be brought up at the opportune moment and discussed at length. His views may not be the same as those of the State Department.

<p>(Paris) Davis returned to Paris from Berlin today. According to what he told a representative of the "Morning Post," Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference or non-participation in the World Economic Conference is no longer a problem. He has obtained Germany's full assurance on this trip. The German revolution has indeed succeeded, but the German government's attitude towards various international issues has not yet been determined. However, he believes that Hitler will be willing to continue various talks. His current task is only as an observer, but after the talks in Berlin, he deeply feels that if the relevant powers can take the necessary initiative, effective peace actions are indeed possible. Germany's acceptance of the British Prime Minister's proposal as the basis for disarmament discussions, and the German government's decision to send experts to the United States to assist the new envoy, Dr. Luther, in the upcoming discussions in Washington, are sufficient to characterize the current situation.

<p>(Washington) Yesterday, rumors spread here that European debtor nations will form their own united front to request the US government to allow a delay in the payment of war debts due on June 15 until the end of the World Economic Conference. The representatives of Britain, France, Italy, and other debtor nations, who are about to arrive here, will submit the above request to the US government. Government officials said that President Roosevelt would certainly reject this approach, and that the leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress also oppose it. The principal of the war debts due amounts to $41,153,840, and the interest amounts to $103,026,834. If some debtor nations cannot obtain permission to postpone payment, they will request an extension of the repayment of the principal. If notice is given within 90 days before the due date, the US Treasury Department can approve it without waiting for congressional approval, but President Roosevelt also opposes this. Roosevelt's intention is to first know whether European countries are prepared to make commercial concessions, and then he will agree to negotiate on the war debt issue. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Japan Incites Puppet Organizations to Cut Off the Eastern Railway's Connection to Provoke Russia</p>
<p>Railway Tracks are Demolished; Rumor is that Japanese and Puppet Troops are Moving Towards the Russian Border</p>
<p>Reports of Banditry are Frequent in the Eastern Section of the Sino-Eastern Railway; Japanese Intentions are Unpredictable</p>
<p>(Changchun) Due to the Sino-Eastern Railway issue, a dangerous situation has arisen between Russia and Japan. The government has repeatedly incited puppet organizations to cut off the Sino-Eastern Railway's connection. The Soviet Union is fully aware that Japan intends to provoke and make unreasonable demands. Since April 8, it has begun to retaliate. International trains are being rerouted through the Ussuri Railway. The Sino-Eastern Railway refuses to transport munitions and military supplies. The Japanese army has been actively transporting large quantities of military supplies to major military locations in the Suifenhe and Manzhouli areas over the past month, preparing to attack the Soviet Union, but this has been fully exposed by the Soviet Union. As a result, disputes are becoming increasingly fierce. The South Manchuria Railway has decided to set up a railway sub-bureau in Harbin to exclusively handle matters related to the Sino-Eastern Railway, in order to seize the Sino-Eastern Railway. It will begin operations within days. (11th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The situation regarding the dispute between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" over the Chinese Eastern Railway is becoming increasingly serious. The switches on the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway were all removed today, and several dozen yards of railway tracks were demolished. "Manchukuo" troops are currently stationed in the square near the railway office, preparing to respond to the incident. Rumors are spreading that Japanese reinforcements have now moved west from Qiqihar. The "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry yesterday sent a note to Soviet Consul General Slavutsky, requesting that all Soviet customs personnel in Manzhouli and Suifenhe leave their posts. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the events that occurred in Manchuria yesterday morning, it seems that a serious railway dispute is likely to occur between "Manchukuo" and Russia. Yesterday, the Japanese military authorities declared that they would use their own personnel to maintain the Chinese Eastern Railway's train operations. This dispute arose from the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau's refusal to allow trains between Manzhouli and Harbin to run to and from Siberia. The railway bureau's action was taken on the orders of Rudy, the Russian director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Rudy issued this order because the "Manchukuo" authorities and police cut off the connection between Outer Baikal and the Chinese Eastern Railway, and so he made this retaliatory action.</p>

<p>After several hours of negotiations yesterday, a train from Manzhouli departed for Harbin, but it was detained after reaching the Dihuiqi station. After several hours, it returned to Manzhouli. Finally, the Japanese military authorities warned the railway bureau that if the trains did not run, the Japanese army would use its own personnel to maintain traffic. Therefore, the train resumed running. The two roads in the eastern border of Suifenhe are also not connected, so that trains cannot now enter or leave Manchurian territory.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Harbin Times, a Japanese newspaper that is regarded as the official organ of the Japanese, published an article today demanding the dismissal of Rudy, pointing to him as the person responsible for moving the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau's vehicles into Russian territory. It said that the Chinese Eastern Railway's Russian employees spontaneously moved 75 locomotives, 739 passenger cars, and approximately 4,000 freight cars into Russian territory. In addition, Su Bingwen also moved 27 locomotives and 250 passenger cars. It was found that the departure of these vehicles was due to Rudy's special orders. Therefore, it is now appropriate to detain him and interrogate him. Rudy has secretly moved vehicles without authorization, and recently there has been a conspiracy to transport locomotives out of Manzhouli. His actions are no different from stealing in the night.</p>

<p>When Moscow is preparing to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan, Rudy is actually stealing vehicles. This not only violates the principle of shared ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway and its business, but will also lead to war between Russia and Japan. A small spark can start a prairie fire. To prevent this in advance, the administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau must be reformed immediately. But if those who are playing with fire are not removed immediately, bystanders will also suffer the disaster of being burned. If Moscow really wants to maintain peace with Japan, just as Tokyo wants to maintain peace with Russia, then why not dismiss Rudy, because he is now trying his best to destroy the possibility of Russian-Japanese friendship and to incite conflict between the two countries? The Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway must also know that Rudy's dangerous actions will have very harmful consequences, not just burning their hands. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Who is Really Behind the Rampant Banditry? <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) News from Suifenhe says that the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is now in a dangerous state. Bandits are constantly attacking stations, destroying railway tracks, and kidnapping and killing residents. For example, on March 11, a train was shot and destroyed by bandits on the Badashiz section. When such situations occur, the railway police are often not on the scene, or arrive too late. In fact, there is no protection at all for the railway's employees and property. The bandits' ability to escape safely and their increasingly escalating behavior are said to be due to their close relationship with the "Manchukuo" authorities and certain Japanese elements. The latter's purpose is to paralyze traffic on the section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Vladivostok by all means. The Japanese and "Manchukuo" newspapers in Harbin have begun an anti-Soviet provocation campaign, falsely accusing the Soviet authorities of aiding the anti-"Manchukuo" forces in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is reported that, at the instigation of certain Japanese elements, White Russians will again arrest a large number of Soviet people serving in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, falsely accusing them of colluding with bandits. (10th TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Soviet officials predict that a large number of Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway will be arrested, as reports from Boli in recent days indicate that there have been many incidents of banditry in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Many people have been killed there, and several Russian railway employees have been kidnapped for ransom. It seems that these actions by the bandits have been secretly instructed by the authorities, and that the list of those kidnapped has also been drawn up in advance. At present, there are widespread rumors in northern Manchuria that Soviet railway employees are secretly assisting anti-Manchu forces. This statement is baseless and seems to be deliberately spread by the authorities in order to provide a pretext for mass arrests. Furthermore, officials in Boli have repeatedly reported that there is a clear understanding between the bandits and the "Manchukuo" puppet officials in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, bandits have repeatedly destroyed railway property, and the authorities have not stopped them, because their intention is to obstruct transportation between northern Manchuria and Vladivostok. The telegram also stated that the White Russian railway protection troops have even colluded with the bandits to carry out their sabotage plans. (10th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Indian Parliament Passes Anti-Dumping Bill Against Japanese Goods</p>

He also stated that public opinion in both Britain and India wishes to cancel the Japanese commercial agreement. Hoare replied that the Indian government is paying close attention to this issue. The recent passage of the anti-dumping bill by the Legislative Assembly is clear evidence of this.

<p>British Foreign Secretary Explains in Parliament</p>
<p>(London) During today's session of the House of Commons, Conservative Party Member of Parliament Walter Runciman asked the Foreign Secretary whether he would notify the Chinese government regarding the lending of British Boxer Indemnity funds to Chinese railways, only to the extent that there were established methods for clearing previous debts on the railways. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that rectifying and completing existing railways would be sufficient to increase the revenue of such railways, and thereby improve the position of those holding bonds secured by such railways. The policy proposed by Walter would have the opposite effect, as it would prevent any particular railway from borrowing funds to increase its revenue, and without such funds, its revenue would still be insufficient to cover ordinary expenses.

At the same time, on the Jielingkou front, our troops have also increased their forces to prevent the enemy from circumventing the attack. On the Gubei, Xifeng, and Lengkou fronts, defensive offensives have been launched in coordination with the various armies in Luan East. The war situation on each route is recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Enemy Offensive Strategy <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>In their military operations, the Japanese army avoids reality and attacks the void, adopting a strategy of surprise attacks. After the failure of the attacks on Xifengkou and Lengkou, they realized that our forces in that area were strong and did not dare to confront them directly. Instead, they turned towards Luan East, attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to penetrate deeply, disturbing our rear. If Luan East is shaken, the various passes of the Great Wall will lose their natural barriers and be difficult to defend. Our army saw through their conspiracy, and while defending the various passes, it also transferred a large army to reinforce Luan East, taking an encirclement strategy against the enemy forces that had invaded Shimen Village. Therefore, since the reorganization of the Luan East defenses, a fierce counter-offensive has been launched, and the enemy has retreated in disarray.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Great Victory in the Counteroffensive in Luandong <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Our troops in Luandong launched a full-scale counteroffensive at dawn on the 7th. On the Tang River front, they crossed Da Wangzhuang. Haiyang was also recovered by our Zhang and Tian regiments. The enemy troops retreated to Liujiang. On the 8th, our main force advanced along the Liujiang road, fiercely attacking Liujiang Station. The left and right wings, from the area of Da Wangzhuang, Yaozhouzhai, and Taipingzhuang, outflanked the enemy's rear, directly threatening Shimentouzhai. After a day of fierce fighting, they recovered various locations west of Da Wangzhuang and villages such as Zhao Zhuang, Xin Zhuang, and Yang Chang. The vanguard reached a point ten miles from Shimentouzhai. On the night of the 8th, all forces advanced towards Shimentouzhai, forming an encirclement. It is widely rumored today that our troops captured Shimentouzhai last night (the 8th), but as of press time, there has been no official telegram to confirm this. The enemy troops invading Luandong this time include over 2,000 Japanese soldiers and over 4,000 puppet troops, as well as organized plainclothes teams infiltrating and disrupting our positions. In terms of weaponry, they have over 20 aircraft and 30 tanks and armored vehicles. In terms of weaponry, our troops are undoubtedly inferior. However, in terms of troop quality, our troops are superior. Since receiving reinforcements of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, our troops have been emboldened and have successively recovered lost territory. The enemy troops are retreating in disarray, and many have been captured. According to a telegram from Luanzhou this afternoon (the 9th), the remnants of the enemy troops have retreated and gathered at Shimentouzhai, numbering approximately 4,000. They are currently building strong fortifications near Shimentouzhai to defend against our attack and await reinforcements. A train carrying Japanese soldiers arrived this morning and has turned towards Jiumentou. The Kwantung Army headquarters, having received news of the Japanese defeat, has transferred Japanese troops stationed in Jinzhou westward, indicating a possible large-scale invasion again. This morning, three enemy aircraft flew over the Haiyangzhen Tang River area for reconnaissance and bombing. One reconnaissance plane also arrived over Luanzhou. Based on the current situation, although the Japanese troops have been defeated, they have not abandoned their attempt to invade and harass Luandong. Our troops are also determined to capture Shimentouzhai. It is expected that a large-scale main force battle will occur within the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Battle Situation at Various Passes of the Great Wall <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese troops' invasion of Luandong was thwarted, they continued to harass various passes of the Great Wall in an attempt to contain our forces. There have been minor skirmishes in the areas of Xifengkou, Lengkou, and Jielingkou in recent days. On the 7th, the enemy troops on the Xifengkou front, under the cover of intense artillery fire, attacked our Laopashan and Haierling areas. After a day of fierce fighting, our Zhao and Huang brigades launched flanking attacks on the enemy, killing many enemy troops by 12:00 AM. The enemy forces, unable to withstand the attack, retreated. Our troops also suffered considerable losses. At dawn on the 8th, the Japanese troops increased their forces and launched a counterattack. The artillery fire was extremely intense. Our troops resolutely fought back and eventually repelled the Japanese troops. Yesterday morning (the 8th) from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM, five Japanese aircraft flew to the Santunying and Saheqiao areas, dropping heavy bombs, causing dozens of casualties among soldiers and civilians. Today (the 9th), there are still Japanese troops harassing outside Xifengkou. On the Lengkou front, on the morning of the 7th, approximately 300 to 400 Japanese soldiers bypassed Dongjiakou and approached Lengkou. Our troops immediately launched a fierce attack. After a standoff until the afternoon, the enemy retreated to Beishuiyuzhuang, where they built fortifications in an attempt to resist. Our troops have launched an attack forward from Taipingzhai. Our troops stationed at Madaogou also clashed with Japanese sentries on the evening of the 7th. The enemy was repelled. Yesterday, three Japanese aircraft bombed Jianchangyingzi, Lengkou, and other places extensively. Our troops had taken precautions and hidden in concealed locations, so there was no significant damage. On the Jielingkou front, over 300 Japanese soldiers advanced towards our positions from Wangjiagou and Liushugou at dawn on the 7th and were repelled by our troops. The enemy in that area is reinforcing troops and appears to be preparing to attack us. Our troops have now reinforced the area, and the defenses are extremely solid. The Japanese troops' continuous harassment of various passes of the Great Wall is disruptive in nature and intended to contain our forces. There will likely be no large-scale fierce battles for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Atrocities of Japanese Troops on the Front Lines <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from He Zhuguo at 7:00 PM on the 7th, Sergeant Hou □□ of the □ Regiment, who was unable to retreat during the Shimentouzhai battle, disguised himself as a civilian and was taken by the Japanese troops to serve as a porter. He escaped during a Japanese retreat. According to him, the Japanese troops treat our civilians as less than human, with extremely brutal treatment. They are not given enough to eat each day, and when they rest, they are imprisoned in a room. Any slight dissatisfaction results in beatings with fists, feet, and gun butts, and some are even shot to death. During the Shimentouzhai battle, he witnessed over 300 enemy casualties, including eight officers, one of whom was a junior officer named Kojima Kotaro, whose rank is unknown. There were also over 70 corpses. The puppet government officials suffered even more casualties. Over 30 political officers from Ding Qiang's (Li Jichun's) unit were casualties at Qianshuiying, leaving only about a dozen survivors. According to reports from plainclothes scouts sent by our troops outside the Great Wall, the Japanese troops are committing all kinds of atrocities in the villages within the territory of Rehe and the Hebei border area outside the Great Wall. Under the pretext of searching for guerrillas, they forcibly take away livestock from civilian homes, such as cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks. The people in those areas, who depend on cattle and sheep for their livelihoods, are filled with resentment and despair upon seeing this. Many men flee into the mountains and attack and kill Japanese troops in an attempt to retaliate. Many women have committed suicide after being raped by Japanese troops. Particularly tragic is the case of a Chinese woman who was shot to death for arguing with Japanese soldiers who tried to take her beef without paying and crying loudly. Several pregnant women were also stabbed to death by Japanese soldiers with bayonets through their abdomens. The atrocities are too terrible to describe. (April 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e82">Uprising of Villagers in Lin'an, Zhejiang <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Uprising Area Almost Covers the Entire City</p>
<p>Losses Estimated at Over 90,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Steps Seem to Have a Strict Plan</p>
<p>It Seems That There Are People Initiating the Uprising Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: A group of people in Lin'an County recently misunderstand the improved silkworm seeds and causes a big riot. It burns down all kinds of seed farms. According to rumors, the inside story of this matter is very noteworthy. The command and planning are very strict. It doesn't seem like an ordinary case. Here are the details of the investigation, especially noted below:</p>
<p>On the fifth of this month, the Fourth District Office sent personnel to Lingfeng Township to collect local silkworm seeds. Tang Laoer, a villager in the township, was the first to object and beat up the basic team. The next day, District Chief Pan Jiong Rong personally went to persuade them. When Pan arrived at the township, □□□ and others had already gathered two or three hundred villagers, and closed Pan in the Tang Family Ancestral Hall, asking to raise local silkworm seeds and defeat foreign seeds. Seeing the crowd surging, Pan immediately agreed in order to avoid causing trouble. Then he asked Pan to issue a notice, and he also agreed. Then he asked Pan to issue a guarantee, and he also agreed. Just as the voices were noisy, suddenly □□□ led two or three hundred villagers from Jinshi Township and Fuxing Township to arrive and broke into the Tang Family Ancestral Hall and joined in the coercion. Pan had to pay a deposit of 500 yuan. Pan could not pay the cash and promised to issue a voucher. At that time, the villager Xu Jinquan did not think it was right, saying that even if the guarantee voucher was issued, where would it be received? He was immediately scolded and beaten by the crowd, and a woman nicknamed Jiu Huaniang bit Xu's legs twice. Pan persuaded and beat Pan again. After being protected by emotionally related person, he was pushed into a small house and was spared serious injury. Later, the villagers asked Pan to pay sixty yuan for the meal, and took Pan to the county for a petition. When passing through Jinxiang Township, Pan paid 15 yuan to buy sesame cakes for food. After eating, he rang the gong in the township and shouted loudly, forcing the villagers of the township to enter the city together to petition, otherwise the houses in the township would be burned. The county party and government organs heard about it, and decided to send Pan Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee, to explain and dissuade the city. When the party committee set off to a place near Shili Langbi, he explained to the leader □□□ and pleaded bitterly with the public. As a result, he was scolded and returned without success. The crowd then gathered in front of the stage outside the Xiangmen Gate of the county seat. At that time, county party committee members Pan Qi, Hu Gezhen, and local gentry Zhou Zigong and others went to persuade the villagers as much as possible. The villagers did not listen and made many demands. In order to avoid the expansion of the storm, the county government prepared a notice to ban the crackdown on the local silkworm seeds. Then, the villagers went to the Xihu Seed Breeding Farm, first destroying the three-story foreign house of the seed farm, then pouring kerosene and setting fire, and monitoring the burning without allowing firefighting. The staff dormitory, office, and kitchen of the farm were also burned to ashes. Later, thirteen newly built silkworm houses were demolished. Later, the police and regimental team leader came to the scene and ordered to go home. The villagers then put forward the conditions: (1) The government is not allowed to arrest the arsonist; (2) Remove Pan, the Fourth District Chief, from his post and investigate; (3) Approve the burning of Paoma Gang Silkworm Farm, the Fourth District Office, and the Qingyun Bridge Sericulture Guidance Institute; (4) In the future, if anyone buys and raises improved silkworm seeds, they should be allowed to burn their houses. The team leader thought that the matter was of great importance and had no right to accept it, so he politely explained it, but it was ineffective. The villagers poured into the city again, and all the sericulture equipment in Wenge were burned. When the villagers were setting fire in the county, the county government immediately asked the province for instructions to send troops to suppress it. At midnight, a platoon of security guards from Yuhang arrived. In order to avoid conflict, the security guards changed to Dongmen to enter the city when they arrived at Sanyanqiao, and temporarily stayed at Cisheng Temple to protect the guidance office. Around 1:00 in the middle of the night, the villagers went to Cisheng Temple again, preparing to burn the guidance office. After being dissuaded by the security guards, nothing happened. At about 4:00, the villagers began to leave in droves. This was the event on the sixth. On the 7th, the Qingshan area in the east township also had villagers gathering to plan to burn the Xihu Seed Breeding Branch. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent the director of the Public Security Bureau to persuade them, and nothing happened. At the same time, the county government heard the news that the villagers in the west township had gathered to burn down the Paomagang Seed Breeding Farm, and sent Captain Lu to persuade them. On the same day, the villagers in the north township demolished the Fifth District Office, the residence of Dong Yizhai, the head of Hengban Town, Yu Bensheng's woodworking shop, and the cocoon shop in the area. After receiving the news, the county government asked Hu Bozheng, a member of the county executive committee, to persuade them, but it was still ineffective. On the 8th, Yun Er Township also launched a crowd to come to the city, with the slogan of destroying salt shops and rice shops and opposing the new measurement system. When they arrived at Xishu, they burned down the houses and equipment of the Linan Seed Breeding Farm. When they were about to enter the city, the county government first demolished the Sigu Bridge to prevent them from advancing. The crowd did not hesitate and still waded forward. At that time, the county chief and the company commander were both present. The county chief persuaded them with kind words, and the company commander acted as a signal to invite the village chief who led the villagers to return to his hometown, and also asked them to return to his hometown. The crowd ignored him. The security guards had no choice but to fire their guns into the sky to warn them. The villagers still waded forward, and the security guards fired their guns a second time, wounding one person with stray bullets. At that time, the villagers saw that one person had been shot and injured, and they ran away one after another, and were stopped by the commander. After the soldiers charged, they fled away. That night, the villagers in the north township sent letters to various townships, agreeing to gather again in the city to cause trouble. After learning about it, the county government immediately invited representatives from various agencies and groups, and Deng, the battalion commander of the security guards, and others to hold a meeting to discuss prevention methods, and decided: (1) The city's defense is the responsibility of the military regiment; (2) Send personnel to set out in eight directions to find out what's going on; (3) The county party department and various mass organizations will issue a public letter to the masses; (4) If the villagers gather in the city again on the 9th to cause trouble, the leaders will be arrested to maintain law and order. At noon on the 9th, according to reports, there was no significant action in Pingbiao in the west township and in the north township. Only in the eastern township, the Xihu Seed Breeding Branch had been dismantled by three or four hundred villagers from Wangjiabu and other areas in Qingshan, and Shao Qingquan, the head of the township, and his son were beaten and their residences were searched and demolished. In the southern township, the situation was still quite serious on that day. Villagers from Yaojiacun and Yinjia Village gathered three or four hundred people with gongs and drums, and went straight to Linglong, demolishing the Third District Office, and all the documents, equipment, and luggage were completely burned. The district chief had already left to avoid them, and the clerks were insulted, beaten and injured. Then they burned down all the Huatai Cocoon Shop. Then they planned to burn down the Cuisheng Seed Breeding Farm, and after the villagers and landlord Chen Quand's family in the area begged bitterly and treated them with wine, meat, and rice, they were saved, but they had to issue a guarantee that they would no longer feed foreign silkworms in the future as a condition. After the county chief learned about it, he joined forces with Battalion Commander Deng and led more than 40 security guards to suppress the situation. When they arrived at the scene, most of them had already dispersed. That night, the provincial government sent He Section Chief and other three people to the county to investigate and deal with the riots of the villagers last time. On the morning of the tenth, the county chief convened a meeting of various agencies and groups to discuss ways to quell the storm. Due to time constraints, no concrete decision has been made. The Provincial Party Department also appointed Wu Yifei to the county to investigate that day. There was no movement in the townships on that day, and the storm seemed to be calming down. As for the losses of the silkworms that were burned, it is estimated that the Xihu Seed Breeding Farm in the city and Qingshan cost more than 70,000 yuan, the Linan Seed Breeding Farm about 6,000 yuan, the Huatai Cocoon Shop about 7,000 yuan, the Hengban Cocoon Shop about 2,000 yuan, and the Yu Bensheng Woodworking Shop, Yu Shiyu, Dong Yizhai, Shi Zheng, Mao Changsheng, Lv Zhenkuan, and Shao Qingquan and other residences suffered losses due to searches and demolitions of about 5,000 yuan. The Fifth and Third District Offices were destroyed, with public and private losses of about 1,000 yuan. The loss of wine and food entertainment and other losses is about 500 yuan. In total, the material losses in this incident are about 90,000 yuan. It is said that some people seemed to have made proper plans before the riot of the villagers, and they returned to the scene to direct the incident, so it is worth noting that: (1) Most of the participants are not silkworm farmers, and there are people who have never met each other; (2) The action is rapid, the methods are consistent, and the steps are orderly; (3) The leaders have no responsible personnel from each township; (4) The on-site commanders have the same special markings. After this riot, the order in the county is not easy to stabilize for a while. The rural economy will inevitably be greatly affected. The basic organization of autonomy has also been severely hit. Local people are deeply worried and hope that the government will have effective measures to seek relief.</p>

<p>More than a dozen bandits suddenly came to Yinglong Temple in Punan last night, armed with firearms. They broke into Wang Daxiang's house, broke down the door and entered, and searched at will. Because there was no cash, they kidnapped Wang Daxiang and two of his female family members. People were sent out to search for them, but no trace was found. It is said that the Wang family makes a living by farming and has no savings. Recently, due to years of poor harvests, their livelihoods have been quite difficult.</p>

<p>The robbery and injury case at Qu Genman's house outside Qimen last week has not yet been solved. The detectives of the Public Security Bureau have dispatched detectives to various hotels such as Ankang outside Jianmen and have successively captured seven key criminals in the case, including Zhang Wenbiao, Zhang Yunxian, Lu Hongsheng, Sun Jinbiao, and Zhou Liangbao, and seized a firearm and bullets. After being released from the team, Detective Xue interrogated them yesterday (11th), and the criminals confessed to robbing Qu Genman's house with a gun and confessed to committing crimes in Changshu, Wuxi, and other places. They were immediately detained for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Cotton Yarn Industry in a State of Collapse <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese cotton yarn industry has recently been unable to maintain itself due to the influx of cotton yarn and the daily decline in market prices, resulting in unbearable losses. Shanghai yarn factories have proposed a nationwide shutdown of yarn factories to all yarn factories for serious discussion, hoping to promote higher sand prices after reducing shipments. Zhang Zeming, chairman of the National Federation of Yarn Factories, came to Wuxi from Shanghai the day before yesterday to jointly consult with the leaders of Wuxi's sand factories and put forward two claims: (1) The daily decline in yarn prices makes it difficult to support this. The factories in Shanghai plan to tend towards a divided strategy and reduce production. , Increase prices invisibly. (2) Following the precedent of the silk factory industry, on the one hand, reduce work, and on the other hand, request the government to provide funds for relief. However, the factories in the Wuxi area believe that the situation is different, the impact is small, and although yarn prices have fallen, the cost of cotton is also cheaper, so they can barely support it. If the implementation reduces work, then the livelihood of workers will inevitably be affected, so it is decided to maintain the status quo temporarily.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Overseas Chinese from Mexico Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Anti-Chinese Impact in Mexico, a Total of Over 140 People</p>
<p>Scheduled to Go to Hong Kong Today to Return to Their Hometown and Petition the Capital, Date Not Yet Set</p>
<p>Far East News Agency: Overseas Chinese from Mexico were affected by the anti-Chinese sentiment of the local government and people. They cannot stand in the local country, and a part of them, more than 140 people, are on their way back to China on the Monroe President, a ship of the US Dale Company. The ship docked at the Dale Pier in Pudong at 8 am yesterday, and the Overseas Chinese Federation sent Peng Can Guang to take care of it.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Return <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Peng Canguang, general secretary of the Global Overseas Chinese Federation, there are about 20,000 overseas Chinese in Mexico. Most of them are businessmen and laborers. This time, Mexico suddenly expelled Chinese. Among them, those who are doing business have declared bankruptcy due to the anti-Chinese sentiment. Those who were laborers were suddenly unemployed, so they could not stand their ground. They all went to the United States. The United States and Mexico are adjacent to each other. The US government said that there are too many unemployed workers in the country, so it cannot accommodate so many unemployed Chinese, so it sent them back to China. The overseas Chinese planned to take the Japanese Queen of the Changxing Company back to China, but because they could not afford the fare, they changed to the American Dale Company's Monroe President to Shanghai. As for all the ship fares and food expenses, the US authorities will request our government to return them, which is the situation of this return to China.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Reason for Anti-Chinese Sentiment <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Peng said again that the biggest reason for the anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico this time is that there are economic recession in the international community, and the economic panic in various countries is no less than that in our country. Mexico is also forced by the recession, and the number of unemployed people in the country is increasing. Our overseas Chinese in Mexico are very developed in business, and at the same time, the labor community also occupies a very important position. Therefore, the people of that country, in order to make a living, launched an anti-Chinese movement regardless of the diplomatic relations between the two countries. Our ambassador to Mexico, Feng Chongzhi, had negotiated with the government of that country, but the government of that country not only did not stop it, but secretly directed it. This shows one aspect of the reason for the anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Petitioning the Capital <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Most of the more than 100 people who arrived in Shanghai yesterday are from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. Therefore, when the ship docked, except for a few people who disembarked to visit relatives and friends, the rest did not leave the ship. They plan to take the original ship to Hong Kong today and return to their hometown. As for the representatives of the capital petition, it is said that they will be recommended on the ship. After arriving in Hong Kong, they will decide on the date of petitioning the capital. It is said that the Overseas Chinese Federation wanted to hold a welcome meeting yesterday, but it was cancelled because these overseas Chinese were scheduled to take the original ship to Hong Kong today to return to their hometown, and there was not enough time.</p>

<h3 id="e92">British Naval Expert Gluckman Discusses China's Urgent Need for a Navy <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Says Airplanes Alone</p>
<p>Cannot Stop Enemy Ships</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that Rear Admiral Gluckman, a British naval expert, has been assisting the Ministry of the Navy in training naval personnel in China for two full years. Yesterday (the 10th), at a luncheon meeting of the United Youth Association, he gave a brief speech on the Chinese Navy, saying that if the Chinese Navy had won in the Sino-Japanese War, the history of the Far East would certainly be very different from what it is today. At that time, the morale of the Chinese Navy was very high, but it lacked ammunition, because the naval funds were diverted by Empress Dowager Cixi to build the Summer Palace. He also said that many people here mistakenly regard the foreign cruisers currently docked in the Huangpu River as instruments of war, but they are not. These warships can only be used for police purposes. If you want to have an elite navy, you must spend a lot of money, which is one of the biggest difficulties today. The purpose of his coming to China is to train naval personnel so that they know newer methods. It takes six years to train an officer and four years to get a good soldier, but warships can be built in two years. One more thing must be solemnly declared: their trip to China was not ordered by the British government, but only invited those who volunteered to take the job. If there were no volunteers, the British government would not send anyone. However, they often regard this trip as a pleasure because they receive such generous treatment. He also said that the navy is urgently needed by China today, but apart from the Yat Sen and the 3,000-ton light cruiser Ning Hai, there is not a single new-style warship. Later, Colonel Thomas, commander of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps, said that if China wants to survive in the world, it must have a navy. The current cry for 1,000 airplanes is a foolish strategy. Airplanes are only one type of weapon. If you only have airplanes but cannot prevent the enemy from sending more and stronger airplanes into the country, what's the use?</p>

<p>Rugao Branch of the Aviation Association Since the establishment of the Chinese Aviation Association, the organization of branch associations has not yet begun because the general association's solicitation of members has not yet ended, and the established branch association organization regulations have only been resolved by the standing directors' meeting and still need to be approved by the entire board of directors. However, in addition to the Taicang County branch, which has already been established, Rugao County has also contacted the general association. The original National Salvation Fund Raising Committee of Rugao County, which is responsible by 11 executive committee members including Jiang Lu, came to Shanghai last week to contact the general association. The general association has handed over various regulations and membership certificates to them to take back and prepare according to the regulations. When it is officially established, the general association will also send personnel to participate in the guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan, Foreign Merchants and Various Industries are Gradually Implementing It <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Money Industry Association Has Agreed to Allow Heng-Character Firms to Accommodate</p>
<p>After all industries were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to implement the abolition of taels and the change to yuan on the 6th of this month, all silver transactions are calculated in silver yuan. Foreign merchant banks have also partially implemented it. As for the request of Heng-character money shops for the Money Industry Association to issue public orders for exchange and accommodation, a settlement has been reached. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Talks to a Reporter from the New Voice Society Yesterday, a reporter met with Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association. According to him, foreign merchant banks have partially implemented the abolition of taels and the change to yuan. Since the 6th, the silver receipts and payments of Chinese merchant banks and money shops have been calculated in silver yuan according to the statutory price of 715. Since the 10th, all foreign exchange transactions have been converted from taels to yuan, and the market has been opened. Silver deposit accounts have been suspended, and silver transaction accounts have been transferred. This is the implementation of the abolition of taels. As for the silver of foreign merchant businesses, although the status quo is temporarily maintained, it will also be converted into silver yuan in the shortest possible time. Therefore, there is no problem with the abolition of taels and the change to yuan by foreign merchant businesses.</p>
<p>Qin Xiqing Talks Yesterday, the reporter also met with Mr. Qin Xiqing, Secretary-General of the Money Industry Association. According to him, the association has resolved that the handling of silver and foreign exchange receipts and payments on the same day by the Heng-character money shop, which is an agent of the Northern City Heng-character money shop, should be handled by the Heng-character money shop itself. Since the request for accommodation has been made, accommodation should be given. When members receive tickets from the Heng-character counterparts in the Northern City, they should bring back the receipt issued by the shop, proving the number of tickets and the amount of silver, and the balance should be cleared by the public order that night. The remaining balance should be cleared at 5:00 p.m. every day. According to the Yuan-character shops, there are funds deposited in the association, but the Heng-character shops do not have funds deposited in the association, so they must be cleared before 5:00 p.m. every day.</p>

<p>Guo Chengen, Director of the Central Mint, submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Finance, but it was repeatedly rejected by Minister Song.

<p>Mr. Kong Releases a Statement</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Xiangxi once expressed his refusal to take the post of Governor of the Central Bank offered by the National Government. On the 7th of this month, he even cabled the National Government to request the revocation of the order. Yesterday, Mr. Kong received a reply cable from the Civil Service Office of the National Government, urging him to take office immediately. It is heard that Mr. Kong will no longer firmly decline. The original cable is recorded as follows: President Kong Yongzhi Jian, I have received the Chairman's instructions and am aware of your cable. The Central Bank's business is important. I rely on your great reputation and talent to continue the scale and take on this great task. I hope you will suppress your humility and take office immediately to live up to the expectations. The request to revoke the order should not be discussed, etc. In particular, Wei Huai, Chief of Civil Servants of the National Government, pays his respects.</p>
<p>This morning, Mr. Kong Xiangxi told a reporter from the Central News Agency that since Minister Song resigned from the post of Governor of the Central Bank due to his busy schedule, the Central Government immediately ordered him to take over. At that time, he cabled his resignation. Since returning from overseas, he has naturally worked hard in this time of national crisis, but he does not need to bear any title. During the period of national crisis, the government organization should not be changed too much. Minister Song has served as Governor of the Bank for a long time, and the Bank was founded by Mr. Song. Therefore, it is better for Mr. Song to resume his post in order to have a skilled person. However, since he resigned, he has not received a formal cable order from the Central Government, so he does not want to make any expression. Mr. Kong continued to talk about the great importance of the World Economic Preparatory Meeting held in the United States. Our country should fully prepare to send someone familiar with our country's economic situation to attend for reference. It is rumored that Minister Song will be sent to participate. He has gained a slight understanding of the current economic situation in various countries during this trip to Europe and the United States, and is willing to contribute it to the government for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Two Concession Municipal Councils Collect Silver Yuan for Property Tax Starting from April <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Both Electricity and Telephone Companies Charge According to 715</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Hopes Citizens Will Pay According to the Fixed Rate</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that since the Ministry of Finance explicitly ordered the implementation of the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, and the calculation based on the 715 silver standard starting from the 6th of this month, the silver and money industries, various industries, and foreign merchant banks in this city have all followed suit. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession in this city sent a special letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council the day before yesterday, hoping that the council would also convert the property tax collection into silver yuan at the legal price of 7 qian 1 fen and 5 li, and hoped that public utilities such as electricity, telephone, and tap water would also change to collecting silver yuan in the same way. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Electricity Company, and the Telephone Company yesterday to inquire, and they all said that they would follow suit starting from this month. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association issued a statement yesterday, hoping that citizens would implement the 715 conversion payment uniformly. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e100">Shanghai Municipal Council to Follow Suit <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and inquired about the council's opinion on the letter from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association requesting that the property tax collection be changed to the 75 silver price. According to the council's spokesperson, the council has always been sympathetic to the Chinese government's efforts to unify the currency system and has tried its best to assist within the possible scope. Now that the Chinese government has explicitly ordered the implementation of the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, and the currency system is calculated at the legal silver price of 715, the council has decided that starting from this month (April), all citizens within the concession who pay property tax may pay according to the 715 calculation and conversion. The Shanghai Municipal Council will collect them uniformly, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Electricity and Telephone Implemented <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Then, the reporter visited the Electricity Company's chief accountant, who said that the Electricity Company had already followed suit since the Chinese government began implementing the abolition of taels and the change to yuan and set the legal silver price of 715, starting from last Saturday (the 9th). In the future, electricity users who come to the company to pay fees can all be converted at the 715 silver price, he said. In addition, according to the secretary and district manager of the Telephone Company, who spoke to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency, the Telephone Company will of course take the same action as the Shanghai Municipal Council, etc. After the 715 silver price was set, the company has been charging according to this price for several days. For example, if you (referring to the reporter) go to the company's collection office today and pay at the 715 silver price, there will be no complications, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e102">French Shanghai Municipal Council Implemented <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council replied to the First Special District Citizens' Union, saying that the council's tax office has been ordered by the council that starting from April 1, all taxes collected will be calculated at the 715 legal price, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Statement of the Taxpayers' Association <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to the responsible spokesperson of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, who spoke to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency, the association follows national laws and regulations and complies with the Ministry of Finance's explicit order to abolish taels and change to yuan with a 715 conversion silver price, and has written to the Shanghai Municipal Council to request that the tax collection and the charging of public utilities should also be handled in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will uniformly handle the payment of fees according to this method starting from this month, on the one hand, to implement the order, so as not to violate national laws and regulations, and on the other hand, if the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax collection staff refuse to accept the 715 silver price, they can report the situation to the association so that it can negotiate on their behalf. It is hoped that all citizens will see this statement and implement it uniformly. The association will not issue another notice, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Military Instructor of Datong University Arrested <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>By Order of the Military Supervision Department to Take Office</p>
<p>Arrested by Order of the Military Supervision Department</p>
<p>The Pacific Society reports that since the establishment of military training at Datong University in Shanghai, military training specialists have been hired every semester. At the beginning of this semester (that is, in February of the Gregorian calendar), a person named Dai Chengzhi suddenly went to the school with an order from the Military Supervision and Training Department and asked to see Principal Wang Boqun. Wang was out on official business, so Vice-Principal Ou Yuanhuai received him. He thought that since Dai had come to the school to take office by order of the Military Supervision Department, there was no reason to refuse him. He immediately obeyed the order and asked him to come to the school to take office. Unexpectedly, this was a fraudulent situation. Dai Chengzhi was suddenly arrested by the Garrison Command yesterday. A reporter from the Pacific Society found this matter to be quite bizarre, so he went to the Garrison Department to interview. The details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Fraudulent Process <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Dai Chengzhi, a native of Wuxi, 22 years old, wearing a Western suit and leather shoes, with an elegant demeanor, went to Datong University in Shanghai in early February of the Gregorian calendar with an order from the Military Supervision Department and asked to see Principal Wang Boqun. Wang was out on official business, so Vice-Principal Ou Yuanhuai received him. Ou thought that since Dai had come here by order of the Military Supervision Department to take on military training, he should be treated favorably. He approved a monthly salary of 80 yuan. Not long after Dai took on the job of military training, he applied to the school authorities, saying that he had now received an order from the Military Supervision Department to concurrently serve as a military instructor at Datong University in addition to Datong University. However, the certificate from the Wuxi Private Middle School that he is currently using is no longer applicable and needs to be changed in Beijing to conform to reality, and requested leave in advance and the salary for the first month. The school authorities said that it was difficult to fully pay in advance because classes had not yet started, so they gave Dai 20 yuan. A few days later, Dai arrived wearing the military instructor badge of Datong University. The school authorities had no doubts. After the school started, Dai was asked to implement training. Unexpectedly, around March 20, Dai asked the school authorities for leave to return to his hometown to complete his marriage. The school also granted him 60 yuan in salary. After a few days, Dai returned to school and continued to work as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Garrison Ordered <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Longhua Garrison Command received a secret order from the Military Training Department a few days ago, stating that a person named Dai Chengzhi had fraudulently used an order from the department to go to Datong University and fraudulently take away his salary. The matter concerned military affairs and was ordered to be secretly arrested and sent to Beijing for interrogation. No one should be allowed to escape, etc. Upon receiving the order, the Garrison Department immediately ordered Adjutant Zheng Letian to secretly go to the school to arrest him and bring him to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Process of Arrest <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Adjutant Zheng Letian of the Garrison Department received a secret order from his superiors and immediately took a car to the school to arrest him. However, Dai had not returned from completing his marriage, so he was unable to arrest him. Until yesterday, Dai returned to school and was in class directing training when Zheng suddenly showed him the secret order of the Training Supervision Department, stating that he knew. Dai initially argued strongly, saying that since the Supervision Department had sent his brother here, how could he be arrested by order of the Supervision Department again? He implied that he could not obey the order. However, since the Garrison Department had received a formal order, it had to obey the order to arrest him. Dai knew that there was no way to recover, so he and Zheng took a car to the Garrison Department for temporary detention.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Dai's Statement <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>When a reporter from the Pacific Society met with Dai, he asked him how he dared to commit such a great impropriety. Dai sighed and said to the reporter, "At this time of economic recession and overstaffing, it is really difficult to find a bite to eat by any means. Rather than falling into the underworld, it is better to take a chance, or perhaps get lucky. Now that I have been caught, I did not intend to do this, but I was really forced by life." After speaking, he sighed for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e109">To Be Sent to Beijing This Morning <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>After the Garrison Department arrested Dai, it slightly interrogated him at the Military Law Department because the matter concerned the arrest of a person designated by his superiors.

<h3 id="e110">Repercussions of the French Concession Police Suppressing Night Work <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Jiu Yi Da Ming Fined Successively</p>
<p>Qiu Zhi Socks Factory Also Intervened</p>
<p>The Shanghai Knitwear Industry Guild presented a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Presenting this petition regarding the French Concession police obstructing work and extorting fines, endangering the entire industry and potentially violating French rights, earnestly requesting serious negotiations to halt these actions." According to a letter from a member, the Qiu Zhi Knitwear Factory, "We respectfully inform you that our factory is located at the intersection of Fulu Li Road and Yapei Road in Guangyu Li, within the factory zone designated by the French Concession authorities. We have been operating day and night for years, and this is not a new occurrence. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 AM on the 7th of this month, while our factory was operating, a Western police officer No. 29 from the French Concession, accompanied by a Chinese police officer, abruptly broke down the factory door, invaded the workshop, and forcefully demanded an immediate work stoppage. At 8:00 AM the next morning, Chinese police officer No. 330 was dispatched to the factory to extort a fine of five silver dollars, issuing a standard French Concession police fine receipt. Surprisingly, on the 9th, the same Chinese police officer was dispatched to the factory again to extort another fine. We believe that knitwear factories are legitimate businesses, and day and night work is not prohibited by law, especially within the factory zone. Operating overnight is not unique to our factory, nor is it unique to Chinese-owned factories. We do not know what police regulations were violated by this fine. Does the French Concession police ordinance explicitly restrict factories within the factory zone from operating at night? Is this regulation applied equally to Chinese and foreign factories? The Western police officer, as a public official, invaded a taxpayer's factory late at night and forced a work stoppage without any basis. If it is claimed that working late at night disturbs people's sleep, then the Lujiawan Power Plant, located nearby, also operates overnight and is in the same factory zone, and its noise is dozens or even hundreds of times louder than our factory. This time, our factory has been unjustly oppressed, ultimately leading to a factory shutdown, which has a minor impact. Other Chinese national factories may also be forced to shut down one by one. Therefore, we must request your esteemed association to petition the government and various public organizations to negotiate firmly with the French Concession authorities to uphold justice." Investigations revealed that there is no explicit order from our government prohibiting night work, nor is there such a regulation in the so-called Concession police ordinance. Recently, the French Concession authorities have frequently arbitrarily punished factories operating late at night within the Concession. What is the basis for this? Moreover, if this punishment is indeed based on the administrative regulations of the Concession, then, according to the agreement on the establishment of a Chinese court within the Shanghai French Concession, the police should bring a lawsuit to the court for trial. The fact that the police dispatched officers to extort fines and issue fine receipts clearly violates the agreement and jeopardizes our national legal rights. Moreover, the Qiu Zhi Factory is located within the designated factory zone. If night work is not allowed within the factory zone, then why have factory and residential zones been designated? Furthermore, Qiu Zhi Factory is not the only factory operating at night, nor is it the only industry doing so. It is difficult to consider the police's arbitrary obstruction of work and extortion of fines as appropriate. Our association has received reports from members such as Jiu Yi Da..., the situation is similar to the previous letter. We respectfully request your esteemed bureau to forward this to the French Concession authorities for legal advocacy, serious negotiations, and to halt their unreasonable interference and extortion of fines, in order to protect sovereignty and maintain the real economy. We eagerly await this.</p>

<p>Changing the Department to a Bureau: The Central Bank's organization is divided into three bureaus: Remittance, Business, and Issuance. The Business Bureau has a National Treasury Department, headed by Li Tisheng, responsible for the National Treasury's receipts and disbursements, such as tax collection, bond issuance, principal and interest payments, and receipts and remittances for various institutions. Recognizing the heavy workload of the National Treasury Department, a decision was made at a meeting to request the Ministry of Finance to approve the expansion of the organization, changing the department to a bureau, and appointing Hu Mengjia, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, as the Manager of the National Treasury Bureau.</p>
<p>Takeover and Preparations: After Hu Mengjia was appointed as the Manager of the National Treasury Bureau, his position as General Manager of the Bank of Communications was taken over by Tang Shoumin. Mr. Hu went to the National Treasury Department at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday to take over from Department Head Li Tisheng.

<h3 id="e113">Municipal Government to Convene Various Groups Today to Discuss Improving Fundraising Methods <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Unifying the Organization in Accordance with Central Government Orders to Show Great Faith</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city, in accordance with Executive Yuan Order No. 1384, stated in brief: "Following the order of the National Government, and approved by the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, an investigation regarding the collection of donations, both cash and in-kind, used to support and comfort the Volunteer Army and front-line soldiers, or to provide disaster relief to the affected population, the intention is commendable. However, the fundraising methods must adhere to the following principles: (1) Contributing a portion of the spirit or material resources of a group of people to the masses, in order to arouse the sympathy of the majority and obtain their surplus materials; (2) Using the efforts and credibility of an organized minority to arouse the sympathy and excitement of an unorganized populace, and to receive their voluntary contributions of spirit and material resources, along with four resolution methods from the 61st Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Executive Committee (detailed below), in order to avoid the occurrence of abuses." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government convened various groups in this city last Saturday for a discussion at the Municipal Government conference room, with the aim of improving existing fundraising organizations in accordance with the Central Government's orders. Considerable decisions were made as a result. A decision has been made to continue convening various groups this afternoon to discuss this matter, so that work can begin immediately. The four resolution methods from the 61st Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Party Headquarters are recorded below: (1) All national social and cultural organizations, schools, and other organizations that collect donations to support the Volunteer Army, comfort front-line soldiers, contribute to military spending, or provide relief to disaster areas, etc., must contribute their intellectual achievements (such as theatrical performances, recreational gatherings, exhibitions, etc.) to the masses, and arouse their sympathy in order to obtain their donations, or use the efforts and credibility of a formal organization to arouse public sympathy and collect donations of cash or in-kind. The adoption of these methods must be approved by the local party and government authorities. The collection and management of funds must be jointly participated in by personnel outside the organization in order to demonstrate great faith. (2) The collection of the aforementioned donations by national trade associations must be managed by a jointly organized committee. This should be initiated and established by the local party and government authorities to establish the organization, so that the public can easily recognize it and feel sympathy. The collection and management of funds must be jointly participated in by a number of members of the organization, and the amount must be made public in order to demonstrate great faith. (3) The collection of donations for the same item must be organized by the party and government authorities of each province and city into a central agency to oversee its completion and show unity. The aforementioned groups or organizations serve as sub-fundraising agencies, and their establishment is based on the principle of meeting needs without duplication. (4) The local government has the authority to strictly ban anything that does not conform to the above methods.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Brief Biography of the New SMC Director, Franklin <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The nine new directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) will take office after the Western annual meeting on the 20th of this month, as reported in this newspaper. We now present the following brief biography of Mr. Franklin, the new American director. He graduated from the liberal arts department of a university in Michigan, USA, in 1913. Seeking further advancement, he entered law school and obtained a law degree in another year. At that time, he was only twenty-two years old. On June 1, 1917, he served as Deputy Director of the Legal Group of the U.S. Consul's Office in Honolulu. On November 4, 1918, he served as a First Lieutenant of Infantry in the Headquarters of the Honolulu Defense Command. On June 13, 1919, President Wilson specially appointed him as a First Class Consul in the Honolulu Consul's Office. His political achievements continued to be outstanding. After completing his term, he came to Shanghai at the end of 1921. Various legal groups there prepared letters of introduction for him. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce even prepared a letter of introduction to the General Chamber of Commerce and other legal groups in this city. He immediately began practicing law. Within a few years, he became well-known in all circles and admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Since the recovery of the Public Concession, he has handled cases for the British and American consular offices and has gained the trust of merchants from those countries. Companies such as Electricity, Telephone, Mobil, Socony, Texaco, Asiatic Petroleum, Pro益, and all American-owned banks in Shanghai have hired him as their legal counsel. Because his cases were numerous and he was overwhelmed, he telegraphed a renowned American lawyer, Harrington, to come to Shanghai as his assistant. A number of East China University law graduates are permanently stationed at the office to handle cases in the Special Zone and inland areas. Now that he has been appointed to the new position in the SMC, he will surely use his strengths to seek the common welfare of Chinese and foreign citizens.</p>

<p>Both the Zhengzhou and the British Ship Sustain Minor Damage</p>
<p>The Zhengzhou, a ship belonging to the United Shipping Company at the Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Haizhou, fully loaded with passengers and cargo. At 5:30 AM yesterday morning, when it entered the mouth of the Wusong River, the "S.S. Parracombe" (transliterated), managed by a British company, was coming from Hong Kong. The ship was steaming full speed ahead. When passing near the first lighthouse on the Shiceng shoal at the mouth of the Wusong River, the Zhengzhou was overtaken. The British ship attempted to pass the Zhengzhou, so its speed was very fast. At that time, the two ships were traveling side by side, but because the tide was very strong, there was a risk of collision. So they sounded their horns to avoid danger, and the bows of the two ships turned away from each other. Unexpectedly, the sterns were too close, so it was difficult to avoid contact, resulting in a collision. The iron plate next to the deck on the port side of the stern of the Zhengzhou was damaged for more than thirty feet. After arriving in Shanghai, the incident was reported to the company for negotiations. It is said that a piece of iron plate on the starboard side of the stern of the British ship was also dented.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The City Will Increase Police Force Next Year <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>| The Municipal Public Security Bureau Has Not Yet Received Official Instructions |</p>
<p>In view of the increasing population density in the urban area and the insufficient police force in each district, the Municipal Government has decided to increase the police force to maintain public order. Yesterday morning, according to Gong..., the Inspector General of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, told the Central News Agency reporter that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has not yet received official instructions to increase the police force. However, it is understood that the plan to increase the police force has been decided to be implemented in the 22nd year, so the details of the increase have not yet been finalized. As for the establishment of female police officers in this city, a decision will be made after July.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Provincial Land Bureau Surveyor Kidnapped by Bandits and Escaped Danger <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Severely Beaten by the Kidnappers</p>
<p>Released in Shanghai After Recovering</p>
<p>Zhao Min, a surveyor from the Triangular Survey Team of the Provincial Land Bureau, from Beiping, was dispatched to Jiading last month to survey the terrain. Later, he took sick leave to come to Shanghai for medical treatment and stayed in a certain hotel. Around the 20th of last month, he took money to the New World Company on Yingda Road to shop when he was suddenly kidnapped by a number of bandits and taken to a bandit den. Because Zhao refused to obey and resisted the bandits, he was brutally beaten by the bandits, covered in injuries, and on the verge of death. Then, Zhao was escorted by the bandits onto a bandit ship and sent to a certain place in Jiangbei. Fortunately, after being identified by the bandit leader, he was found to have been mistakenly kidnapped, so a doctor was hired to treat his injuries. Bandits were sent to send him back to Shanghai and release him. He has now escaped danger. However, when Zhao was kidnapped, he had more than 100 yuan in cash on him, all of which was searched by the bandits. Although he has escaped kidnapping and regained his freedom, he has no travel expenses. Yesterday, he borrowed three silver dollars from a fellow villager on Route Lafayette in the French Concession and took the Beijing-Shanghai express train yesterday afternoon to return to the Provincial Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Sacrifices of Workers Under Machines <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>| The Number of Deaths is as High as 138 People |</p>
<p>Because there is no mandatory reporting method for factory accidents, it is difficult to know the exact number. According to the court inspection reports and hospital reports obtained by the Public Concession Police Department, in the past six years, 138 people have died in factory accidents, and 119 people have been injured. This also shows the general situation. In addition to major accidents such as explosions and fires, there were also 24 deaths and 4 injuries due to carelessness among machines. Among the deaths, the most were caused by rotating belts, with more than ten people. Either their bodies or clothes were caught in the belts, resulting in death, or they were hit by objects when moving the belts, or people were injured when the belts broke. To prevent this danger, the best method is to add nets to the rotating parts of the belt pulleys as much as possible. Special care must be taken when approaching these parts. Also, when the belts are not in use, they should be racked up, and special poles should be used to place the belts on the pulleys. In modern methods, machines should be divided into parts and become a unified system, so that when repairs are needed, the parts can be temporarily stopped or slowed down. There were also seven deaths due to electric shock in the reports. In addition to accidents caused by broken wires, the rest were due to ignorance. The laws of Western countries require that the metal parts of electric lights be covered, and that the metal parts of all movable machines that may be electrified must be equipped with three-way wires to avoid danger. In addition, five people died from falling due to the lack of railings in elevators. Two people died from broken planing wheels. A rolling machine in a dyeing factory injured two people. A mixing machine in a bakery killed one person. Two people died and one person was injured from accidentally falling into boiling water tanks or oil tanks. Recently, in a weaving factory, a shuttle flew out and injured the eye of a female worker, who has been sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The factory law promulgated by the Chinese government stipulates that all deaths or serious injuries in factories must be reported. In the future, accidents can be recorded, and the accidents in one place can be used as a reference for another place.</p>

<p>Shanghai lacks places for pleasant outings. If you want to enjoy the beautiful scenery in the spring and autumn, and swim in the water in the morning and evening of the long summer, then the Minhang Pu Bin Garden can be included in the list. It is reported that the garden will open on the 14th of this month. From now on, the men and women of Shanghai will have one more scenic spot for suburban travel by car. As for its tickets, it will temporarily charge six dimes per person, five yuan for an annual pass for individuals, and ten yuan for the whole family. The Luo Ban Chen Piano Store on Nanjing Road, the Hechang Hardware Store on Broadway Road, and No. 343 Fuzhou Road all have consignment sales.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the dangers workers face when using machines can be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Counties in Jiangsu Province Actively Respond and Request Improvement of Fees and Taxes on Tobacco and Alcohol <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The undertakers of tobacco and alcohol fees and taxes in this province do not care about the merchants' difficulties and increase the quota every year, often increasing the burden on merchants and causing disputes from time to time. Tobacco and alcohol merchants in this city are planning to find ways to improve the situation. Then the two industry associations in Suqian and other three counties sent letters to invite merchants from various counties in Jiangsu Province to gather together. They planned to choose a place with convenient transportation to initiate and convene the meeting. After receiving the letter, the Nine Tobacco and Alcohol Associations in Shanghai decided to convene a joint meeting to first solicit initiators from ten counties with larger quotas. After sending out letters, they have received replies from many counties. Yesterday, the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association received a joint letter from the two industry associations of Gangshan County, the Tobacco Industry, the Alcohol Industry, and the Cigarette Industry, stating, "We respectfully inform you that since the election of the committee system, the suffering of our tobacco and alcohol industries is indescribable. The current year is coming to an end. If we do not take steps to relieve the suffering in advance, the harm will be endless in the future. Our associations are planning to send letters to the tobacco and alcohol industry associations in various counties throughout the province, unanimously requesting your association and the Zhenjiang and Jiangning Associations to preside over everything at a location with convenient transportation, be responsible for preparations, and organize the provincial joint association procedures, etc., in order to convene a provincial tobacco and alcohol industry representatives' conference as soon as possible, so as to resolve the difficulties, so that we can safely do business. Recently, we read in a Shanghai newspaper that your association has sent letters to the tobacco and alcohol industry associations in Zhenjiang and other counties to solicit opinions, initiate convening, and organize. We are very impressed and appreciate your association's efforts to relieve merchants' difficulties and your insightful foresight. Our association extremely approves of this action, so we have specially sent this letter. We hope that your association will investigate, and vigorously handle it. This is what we sincerely hope."</p>

<p>The French Municipal Council has increased the hawker license fee from 2 yuan to 5 yuan per month in order to increase revenue, and has detailed the license application procedures. As a result, the street vendors panicked and requested the French Concession Street Vendor Association to send a telegram to the French authorities to request exemption from the increase. No solution has yet been obtained. Yesterday, some street vendors in the Ximen Road and Saipisai Road areas of the French Concession jointly applied to the French Municipal Council for licenses, requesting that they still be issued licenses at the original amount of 2 yuan. In the Eastern District, no solution has been obtained.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held its April regular meeting at the Bank Club at 7:00 PM on April 10. More than 40 people attended. After the meal, Chairman Xu Peihuang reported on the branch's affairs and designated Zhang Xiaoji and Jin Zhixuan to prepare for a tour to Zhapu next month. Secretary Zhou Qi resigned, and Shi Konghuai was publicly elected to succeed him. Then Sun Baochi, a bridge engineer from the Jiaoji Railway, reported on the Qingdao branch's affairs and the recent situation of Qingdao's municipal administration and the Jiaoji Railway project. Then, Chief Engineer Chadley of the Dredging Bureau delivered a speech, wishing to be economical for river and sea engineering. He first stated three main points: First, engineers must be able to create profitable and independent planning projects; second, engineers must pay close attention to the unemployment problem caused by the application of machinery; third, engineers should study politics, and then elaborate on how water conservancy problems, such as disaster prevention, river management, irrigation, and hydropower, can be economical and uneconomical. After the speech, members discussed it one after another, and the interest was strong. The meeting ended at ten o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e125">First Aid Medicine for Front-Line Soldiers <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The war in North China is becoming increasingly fierce, and the number of wounded soldiers on the front line is very large. However, due to road blockages and transportation difficulties, they are often unable to return to the rear for treatment, and excessive bleeding easily leads to death. Although there is a first-aid medicine called Yunnan Baiyao, it is too expensive and difficult to purchase. Now, Fei Zibin, a tenth-generation physician of the Menghe School of Medicine, has taken pity on this and, based on his accumulated experience and personal insights, invented a first-aid, hemostatic, and pain-relieving medicine. He has successively handed it over to General Zhu Qinglan for transportation to the front line in large quantities, intending to benefit the soldiers and fulfill his national duty. This medicine has incredible efficacy and is even better than Baiyao, but it is cheaper and easier to popularize. For all kinds of gunshot wounds, shrapnel wounds, and knife and sword wounds, if applied to the affected area, it will immediately stop bleeding, relieve pain, and turn danger into safety. Therefore, Xu Shiying, Zhang Xingyan, and others have all given strong praise. Renowned novelist Zhang Henshui also wrote the four characters "Warriors Worry-Free" to promote it. At this time of national crisis, when the two armies are bleeding, it is deeply hoped that kind people and charitable organizations in the country will purchase this magical medicine in large quantities to save the loyal and brave soldiers on the front line. Mr. Fei has poetry and books in his belly and is indifferent to profit. He invented the magical medicine with the aim of helping people and will never use this to make a profit.</p>

<p>Pioneering Charitable Undertakings Among Merchants</p>
<p>Creating Many Benefits for the Proletariat</p>
<p>Nearly 1,000 employees of the New World Department Store on Nanjing Road, recently, the company's management and senior employees, in view of the hardship of social life, for the sake of the happiness of the majority of lower-level employees, specially initiated the organization of an employee charity society. The company specially donated a basic fund of 5,000 yuan. Membership is limited to the company's employees. The method of ordinary life insurance is imitated, but the membership fee collected is very small. Lower- and middle-level employees only collect 1 to 2 dimes per month. Those who unfortunately die during their employment period will receive a one-time subsidy of 300 yuan for funeral expenses. If there are family members, they will be given another 200 yuan in alimony, for a total of 500 yuan, so that the families of working-class people who unfortunately die have a line of support for their lives. This is the first charitable organization in a commercial organization.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Chaozhou Fellow Association Sends a Telegram Urging Unanimous Support for Opposition to Soybean Cake Donation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Chaozhou Fellow Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Shantou Municipal Party Headquarters and county-level party branches, and county, city, and township associations, as well as Chaozhou fellow countrymen abroad, saying, "We received repeated telegrams from Shantou merchants that the Shantou Taili Company first deceived the consuls, and then violated the orders, taking advantage of its power to detain dozens of ships carrying domestic soybean cakes from Shanghai, Yingkou, Andong, Hankou, and other places to Shantou, and forcibly ordered them to pay donations. An investigation revealed that the company previously concealed its application to the provincial government to start the Shantou soybean cake donation. Because merchants believed that this exorbitant donation hindered the people's livelihood, they requested permission to cancel it. The company falsely claimed that soybean cakes were imported goods and should be taxed. After the merchants argued that soybean cakes were produced in our country, they secretly asked the financial and educational commissioners to issue a clear order exempting them from taxation. The company then falsely claimed that soybean cakes produced in various places in the three northeastern provinces should be treated as enemy goods, like Dalian in the leased territory, and should be subject to enemy taxation. They did not know that although Yingkou, Andong, and other places had fallen to the enemy, our country was still resisting and had not ceded them to the enemy. How could they be treated as enemy goods by their own people? Even if they were enemy goods, they should have been clearly banned from transport in advance. Why did they detain the soybean cakes at the time of urgent need for spring plowing? Furthermore, how could enemy goods be resolved by paying a heavy donation? Even the customs still taxes them as domestic products. Soybean cake is a domestic agricultural product and should not be subject to heavy donations at all. Now that the situation has become chaotic, the beginning of the disaster can be traced back to the tax farming contractors mismanaging the government. In addition to requesting the provincial consuls to quickly order the release of the detained soybean cakes and to abolish the Taili Company, and to ensure that tax collection is no longer contracted out in the future to eliminate abuses, we urgently request that you uphold the purpose of protecting agriculture and commerce, and help our homeland, and unanimously support and strive to maintain agricultural time and alleviate suffering. We are extremely anxious. The Chaozhou Fellow Association in Shanghai bows.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Health Bureau Designates Songnan as a Living Pig Stockyard Area <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The pig dealers of Yuanshunyuan, Dachangyuan, Zhaolong, and other pig companies within the Shiliupu of South Shanghai previously rented land in the Xuejiabang of Nanshi to build fresh pig stockyards. It has been more than ten years since then. It is reported that the lease contracts for the land there are about to expire. Because the Shanghai Municipal Government Health Bureau believes that the market there is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the population has increased sharply, there should be no living pigs stocked in densely populated areas, and the noise and smell of the pigs are a health hazard. It has specially designated the area on the south bank of the Wusong Yunzao River, near Yizhou Tang Mouth, as a fresh pig stockyard area. A notice has been issued to all pig companies to move the fresh pig stocks to Songnan. It is said that the pig companies are now jointly petitioning, requesting a postponement of the implementation. On the other hand, they are seeking people familiar with the Songnan situation to rent land in the Yangjiazha area east of the Yunzao River Railway Station. Once it is settled, construction will begin immediately. However, the pig market in Wusong will have a great day of development in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Extrajudicial Arrest Case on West Xin Bridge Street May Come to an End <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>| Mr. Du Yuesheng's Reply to the Support Association |</p>
<p>The Support Association for the Extrajudicial Arrest Tragedy, considering that the French Concession authorities, in addition to the layer of compensation, had already paid it, but they had not yet fulfilled their promises regarding punishing the perpetrators, offering apologies, and guaranteeing that similar incidents would not occur in the future.  On the 7th, they submitted a letter to the Municipal Government and Mr. Du Yuesheng, requesting that they continue negotiations. This was reported in the previous newspaper.  It is now known that the Support Association received a reply from Mr. Du yesterday, as follows. This case may come to an end. Directly replying: I recently received your great letter, respectfully listening to everything. The Xin Bridge Street tragedy occurred this time, and I, Yong, was motivated by righteous indignation to take on the negotiation. The French authorities still know the general situation and are working hard to punish the perpetrators. They have already handed over the Vietnamese police officers involved in the incident to the court for punishment according to the law.  In addition to the compensation, which has been resolved, the French authorities have tacitly approved the two women traveling by car and will no longer interfere in the future. As for the guarantee, the French authorities have always had a harmonious relationship with the residents of the concession and have strict restrictions on detectives, so similar incidents will never happen again. In my humble opinion, this section is still credible and there is no need to over-demand anything. In short, the French authorities have essentially acknowledged what we requested, and this case can come to an end.  That is my humble opinion, I wonder what you think. Sincerely, to the Tragedy Support Association, Du Yong, April 9th.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Dispute over Breach of Contract for Chartering a Ship Between Two Coal Companies <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Heng'an Chengji Steamship Company, because the Mainland Yuchang and two coal companies, Wang Xie Hengchuang, violated the ship chartering contract, hired lawyer Cai Rudong and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay off the outstanding rent of more than 14,100 yuan. The defendant also hired lawyer Yang Linzhi to submit a statement in defense. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong held a court hearing to summon the parties. Lawyer Yang first made a statement on the issue of the subject of the lawsuit, saying that Xie Hengchuang was only the manager of Yuchang, while the manager of the Mainland was Lin Mengchui. Yuchang and the Mainland were actually two organizations and not one entity. The plaintiff said that the company was founded by Xie, and Xie could not admit this. Now Lin Mengchui has also arrived in court on behalf of the Mainland to respond to the lawsuit, so please review this point first, etc. Lawyer Cai immediately said that everyone outside knew that the two companies were opened by Xie Hengchuang. If he denies it, he must provide proof of capital. Empty words are not credible. Lawyer Cai then continued to state the plaintiff's intention to sue, generally saying that the plaintiff and the defendant signed a ship chartering contract on the 3rd day of the 20th year of the Republic of China, chartering the Yunlong steamship to the defendant for a period of one year, with a monthly rent of 8,500 yuan. According to the custom of the shipping industry, after the ship is chartered, it must be declared to the customs to transfer the management rights to the charterer, so the ship was transferred to Yuchang at that time. As of February 9th of last year, the defendant owed rent of 10,238.88 yuan. Although a promissory note issued by Yuchang was received, it was not honored when it was due. The rent of 8,500 yuan for one month from February 10th to March 9th was also not paid by the defendant. In addition, there was a wireless electricity fee of 275.68 yuan paid on behalf of the defendant. After deducting the ship turned over, the coal stored in the ship, the ton tax paid, and the 1,000 tons of coal received from the defendant, valued at 1,200 taels of silver, and a deposit of 800 yuan, the defendant still owed the plaintiff a net rent of 14,113.94 yuan. The defendant claimed to be responsible for the rent only until January 3rd, because he requested to terminate the lease on that date, but the plaintiff did not agree. Lawyer Linzhi then stood up to reply, saying that in addition to the undisputed points, there were two points of contention: (1) The defendant terminated the ship chartering contract on February 3rd and was not responsible for the rent from February 4th. According to the contract, although the one-year term should be from March 9th of last year, the Mainland Coal Company repeatedly sent letters to the plaintiff from February 1st of last year, stating that due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, the ships could not travel. According to Article 31 of the contract, the ship should not be allowed to sail to the war zone, and the contract should be cancelled, and the location of the ship was informed for receiving. Although the plaintiff replied that he would not agree to terminate the contract, the defendant had actually stopped commanding the ship from February 4th. It was the plaintiff's fault for not receiving it, etc., and cited the lawsuit caused by the Yuan'an Steamship Company and the China and Foreign Steamship Company also terminating the ship chartering contract due to the January 28th Incident as an example. He then continued to state the reasons for his second point of contention, saying that the plaintiff only allowed the rent during the repair period to be deducted as a result of the ship's accident in Qingdao. However, the defendant believed that it should be from December 13th of the year before the accident to the completion of the repair. The ship encountered danger in Qingdao on December 13th and returned to Shanghai on the 23rd. It was put into the dock for repairs the next day until January of last year before it was returned to the defendant for use. Therefore, not only should the rent during the repair period be deducted, but also the rent during the accident period should not be borne by the defendant. According to Article 9 of the contract, if an accident occurs, the charterer may stop paying the rent. All expenses after the accident were listed by Yuchang's Qingdao branch and sent to the plaintiff. In the future, the plaintiff can claim compensation from the insurance company based on the bill. The defendant does not claim to join this case now. For the sake of fairness, the defendant is still willing to compromise on the rent during the accident period. In addition to the 6 days from the 13th to the 18th, which should be fully deducted, from the 19th, the ship set sail from Qingdao to Shanghai and arrived on the 23rd. During these five days, the ship was sailing, and only a small amount of cargo was loaded, so the daily rent should be deducted by half to show fairness. The contract stipulates that if the rent is calculated on a daily basis, then each month should be counted as 30 days. The amount of rent listed in the plaintiff's statement from January 19th to February 9th counts January as 31 days. According to the contract, the defendant should enjoy this day's benefit, so it is specially stated, etc. Judge Shen believed that this case still needed investigation, so he ordered a change of date for further interrogation.</p>

<p>| Multiple Theft Cases Have Also Been Investigated |</p>
<p>Qingpu native Qian Jingdong, nicknamed Da Age, gathered Tongzhou natives Shen Baorong and Zhu Miaofa on February 15th of this year. At 10 a.m., at the entrance of the Aidoa Road Commodity Exchange, he intended to kidnap Shao Jingyun, the president of the East Asia Bank, for ransom. However, the General Patrol Room detectives discovered the plot and arrested Qian and the other two separately, seizing a pistol and preventing Shao from suffering. Qian and the other three were sent to the First Special District Court by the patrol room and sentenced to severe punishment. Last Sunday, General Patrol Room Chinese detectives Liu Xiangzhai and Pang Ruiqing were investigating a abduction case at No. 54 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, when they suddenly discovered that the woman Wu Sibao, who lived in the house, was the concubine of Ding Caixi, another fugitive in the Shao kidnapping case. They arrested her and seized three pistols and a large number of bullets in Wu's room. Based on Wu's confession, they also arrested two accomplices, Shao Shouyi and Zhang Asi, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. At the time, because the patrol room still had to arrest accomplices, it was not disclosed. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the head of the criminal division of the First Special Court, opened a criminal court to continue the interrogation. Patrol Room lawyer Ru Baoqi said that in addition to the kidnapping case, the defendants had also committed many theft cases. There were already six or seven cases that the defendants had confessed to, but there were more than that number. The patrol room is now working on a detailed investigation, so please allow a further postponement of the trial. When questioned, Zhang Asi admitted that he was with Shen Baorong and others at the entrance of the Commodity Exchange that day to plot a kidnapping. Judge Qian then ordered that Wu, Shao, and Zhang be sent back to prison separately and rescheduled for interrogation.</p>

<p>Shen Rongsheng, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 270 Gaoshou Lane, Haining Road, Public Concession, was 45 years old this year. Recently, he was working as a substitute tea waiter in the joint life-lecturing teahouse opened by Zhang Xietang (blind), a Ningbo native, at No. 125 Feifei Road, French Concession. At 4:30 p.m. on the 10th, someone was doing a star-resolving and praying ceremony and needed silver ingots. Shen went up to the attic of the reception hall to get the ingots. When he was going down the stairs, he lost his footing and fell from the stairs, causing his head to break and bleed, and he immediately fainted. After being rescued, he was sent to Renji Hospital. Due to severe brain concussion, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6 p.m. that day. At 8 a.m. yesterday, the hospital reported to the French patrol room, which sent detectives to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for autopsy, while investigating the circumstances of the fall. The patrol also summoned the deceased's wife, Shen Wang, and the witness, Zhang Asi, the daughter of the owner of the life-lecturing teahouse, to the patrol room. After the head of the patrol questioned them, he ordered them to wait for the Second Special Court to send someone to examine and investigate the matter today.</p>

<p>| His Skull Was Shattered and His Flesh Was Mangled |</p>
<p>The copper building of Qiu Tianbao at No. 7 Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen, had old water pipes placed around the roof. The manager of the building, Ying Xiansan, notified the Yushenghongji Manufacturing Factory on Wuchang Road, Zhabei, to hire several construction workers to remove the water pipes and replace them with new galvanized iron water pipes. The factory then sent construction workers Xue Xunquan and Zhang Tao from Pudong to replace them yesterday morning around 9 a.m. After Xue and the others arrived at the building, they stepped onto the roof. Because there were reinforced concrete railings around the top, and the water pipes were installed under the railings, Xue climbed to the outside of the railings, holding the railings with one hand and straightening the other hand to remove the old water pipes below. He was about to replace the new pipes when he did not expect that the vertical file in the railings, although made of cement, was not connected to the railings, but was nailed to the railings with iron nails after being cast. Therefore, the construction was extremely unstable and could not bear the weight, so it broke immediately, and Xue also fell from the third floor, falling to the road. His head and skull were shattered, his flesh was mangled, and the joints of his limbs were also broken. He screamed tragically and fainted from the pain. Zhang Tao and the others then sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, the rescue was ineffective, and he died in the afternoon. Afterwards, Zhang Tao rushed to Pudong to inform the family of the deceased to come south to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>The relationship between sisters-in-law deteriorated</p>
<p>Two fathers-in-law staged a tragedy</p>
<p>Yang Shangqing, a native of Haimen, 59 years old, lived at No. 151 Daji Road, Nanshi. He used to be a rickshaw puller, but recently because he was old and weak, his son had become an adult, so he no longer engaged in hard labor. His wife, Zhang, was a widow who remarried. When she married Yang, she brought two sons with her (commonly known as "trailing oil bottles"), the eldest named Shigen, 28 years old, who had married Gong as his wife. Zhang then had a son with Yang named Amao, who is now 24 years old and married Shi, 21 years old. Both sons pull rickshaws for a living. However, the relationship between Gong and Shi, the sisters-in-law, was very bad. They often quarreled over trivial matters. The day before yesterday, the two sides quarreled again and ended up fighting each other. However, Shi was not Gong's opponent. As a result, Shi was hit by Gong several times. Unexpectedly, Shi's father, Shi Zhusan (46 years old), suddenly came to Shanghai from Haimen yesterday afternoon. He was extremely angry when he heard that his daughter had been beaten. So at about 7 p.m., he went to Yang's house to negotiate with Xiaoqing. Before they could agree, the two fathers-in-law started fighting again. Unexpectedly, in a hurry, Xiaoqing was punched in the waist and fell down. When everyone helped him up again, he was already dead. When Shi saw that he had caused the disaster, he tried to run away, but was caught by the nearby police officer and taken to the Second District General Office along with the witness. After District Chief Jin interrogated them one by one, he ordered them to be detained and wait for the local bailiff to be summoned to report to the Local Court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Chen Hongfa, a Hunan native residing at No. 430 Minguo Road, French Concession, and his fellow villager Huang Jun, came to Shanghai last year. Unable to find a job, he came up with a bizarre idea of soliciting donations everywhere in the name of the People's National Salvation Group for his own use. It has been more than a year since then and he has not been exposed. Recently, someone discovered it and secretly reported it to the French patrol room. Detective Wang Rusong went and arrested Huang, and found a donation book with more than 340 yuan, all of which had been used up. Chen Hongfa, the second landlord, was also taken to the patrol room and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution and interrogation. This has been reported in the previous newspaper. The interrogation has been completed. Yesterday, Judge Wu Fanglian came to the court and brought the two defendants to court and sentenced Huang Jun to six months of fixed-term imprisonment for repeated fraud. Before the judgment is determined, the number of days of pre-trial detention will be used to offset one day of imprisonment for every two days. Chen Hongfa is innocent.</p>

<p>Li Shaoguang Establishes an Extra-Curricular Clinic The more civilized the world is, the more complex the diseases become, especially functional diseases are the most common. Such as memory loss, insomnia, stuttering, cheek color, neurasthenia, pressure mania, etc. Since drugs are difficult to attack, they must rely on mental therapy. Moreover, these symptoms do not seem to interfere with the occupation on the surface. Therefore, most people in the middle class and students who suffer from this do not pay attention to it, and they do not have time and money to seek treatment from ordinary doctors. It is recently heard that mental therapist Li Shaoguang, in view of this, has stepped up his work and established an extra-curricular clinic. The time is from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., and the medical fee has been reduced to two yuan, which can be occupied by those who do not need medicine, to benefit the sick. This is also a unique move in the medical community. Dr. Li's clinic is located at No. 656 Weihaiwei Road (west of Moore Ming Road). The No. 19 public bus can go directly. Telephone number 30065.</p>

For the convenience of litigants, it, together with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, issued the *Two Court Daily* starting on March 10, and had posted a notice in the case. Now, because the court's disclosure office has been repaired and expanded, its location is sufficient for application, and because the daily has not been widely sold since its publication, it has not been able to thoroughly implement the original purpose of facilitating litigants. It has been changed to stop publication starting yesterday. In the future, all court announcements, in addition to the usual postings, will still be sent to newspapers for publication, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e146">A Collection of Letters Discussing the Question: "Can We Go Back to the Countryside?" <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>(4) A letter from Mr. Liu Simin of this port (2) Three discussions on "Can we go back to the countryside?"</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. You's reply to my letter, and hurriedly wrote an article to discuss with Mr. You. Due to space constraints, I will temporarily end here. Now I will raise a few more points for Mr. You and other readers and editors to learn from: (1) The political issue of the "New Utopia." Mr. You first fell into contradiction on this issue. He said that "the new utopia is a village with convenient transportation, scientific production, education, emphasis on hygiene, beauty and purity," which is naturally indifferent to the world, as if to say "Dig a well and drink, cultivate the land and eat, what does the emperor's power have to do with me?" However, Mr. You also said: "We need urban patriots and people of virtue to go to the countryside to lead farmers to transform and build, and to relieve suffering," which is problematic. We want to ask: The so-called suffering of farmers is naturally heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes. How do you lead farmers to relieve them? The so-called suffering of farmers is of course the exploitation of usury. How do you lead farmers to relieve them? Farmers want to grow grain, but warlords and bureaucrats force them to grow opium poppies. How do you lead farmers to relieve the suffering of this cultivation? Those who cultivate have no land. How do you lead farmers to demand the cashing of the check for "those who cultivate have their land?" Local tyrants, evil gentry, warlords and bureaucrats oppress farmers. How do you lead farmers to relieve their suffering? If in the countryside, some people (naturally the majority) have nothing to eat, and some people's food is "piled up like a mountain," how do you lead farmers to transform and build? The warlords fight each other and want to force farmers to supply food and pay military expenses. How do you lead farmers to relieve this kind of suffering? In the countryside, poor people oppose rich farmers. Which side are you on? Suppose your utopia is in Tongzhou, and the Japanese Marines landed ashore. Naturally you don't fight, naturally you want to avoid it, because our farmers are too "ignorant," as you said, how can your new utopia survive? Hang the sun flag? Otherwise, move to another place, and you can't create such a "beautiful and pure village" for a while, what should you do? Suppose your "new utopia" is in Ganzhou or Fuzhou (southern Jiangxi, western Jiangxi, with beautiful mountains and rivers and convenient transportation, which is most suitable for the construction of Mr. You's new utopia), and the Communist army comes and hangs a red flag at the entrance of your utopia, what do you do? When the National Army comes, they say you are colluding with the bandits, what do you do? A model village in France in the middle of the eighteenth century and a great sacrificer in Belgium could not solve this problem. Their utopias are just a kind of monastery-like operation in capitalist society, using a passive way to maintain capitalist society. What does it have to do with the entire rural economy? Mr. You! We must ask you for a clear answer to these questions. (2) The political issue of "rural education." Suppose Mr. You's "new utopia" is successful and rural education is perfectly realized, then I ask: What do you teach? Mr. You is an agricultural student, so of course it is seed improvement, arable land improvement, sowing improvement, fertilization improvement, mechanization, and electrification. Farmers must have considerable knowledge of general education to reach this point. Young farmers therefore aroused their own awareness. They demanded reform of land relations, demanded the abolition of heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and expressed resistance to local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, and even united farmers to resist Japan. This kind of movement is inevitable. Then, how do you lead them when you are in the situation? Isn't this kind of education "coughing up tuberculosis?" A friend of mine used to run rural education very successfully, and the children of farmers were all energetic, but he also attracted the attention of the authorities. As a result, the school was disbanded and several students were shot (some said more than a dozen, which are naturally the so-called rioters). He, the old gentleman, ran away. Another friend of mine ran some rural schools near Shanghai, which are said to be very successful. Once I met him, I wished him success, and at the same time I mourned his failure. Because if his rural education is really successful, the children of farmers will definitely not be those docile lambs, and they will definitely not fail to conflict with local gentry and officials, and the result will only be failure. (3) The issue of resisting Japan and "rural education." Now some scholar-officials, in this "sinful" situation of losing the land of four provinces, know that the first condition for real resistance is to let the people rise up themselves and implement national armed mobilization. In this way, the revolutionary national war has expanded, and the power of the people has naturally expanded with it. This is naturally inconvenient. As a result, it can only be submerged under various forms of "long-term resistance," "preparing for resistance," "education to save the country," "learning to defend the country," "economic severance," and "if the enemy comes to attack, we will resolutely resist." Among these various forms, the most powerful one is "education to save the country." Their reason is that workers cannot rise up to resist because they are too uneducated; farmers have even less hope because they are too "ignorant" and too "uneducated." How can this kind of talk not be high-sounding, but what is hidden under this talk! On the one hand, it is to cover up their crimes of losing land and fleeing without fighting, or fighting without strength, or fleeing from this battle to that battle, in order to preserve their bodies and wives. On the other hand, it is to ease the enthusiasm of the mass national war and the anti-imperialist war. As for the real education of the working masses, it cannot be received in any European and American schools, and it cannot be taught by any university professors and students studying in the East and West! As for farmers, it is naturally the same. They may not know a word, but they can deeply feel their own sufferings. Although they cannot chant poems, they all know that local tyrants, evil gentry, and corrupt officials are their enemies. Although they will not say what doctrine or what nation, they are a great force to resist imperialism and overthrow autocracy. The British Magna Carta movement was completed in this way, and the French Revolution went through this way. Mr. You! Do you want to talk about farmer education? Then there is no better education than the French Revolution, and no better education than the Russian Revolution. And this great lesson full of historical significance is the inevitable result of the convergence of various educations of struggle carried out under the slogan of opposing heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes, reducing rent and grain, opposing corrupt officials, opposing warlord wars, and anti-imperialist wars. Mr. You! I dare say that you have never learned this kind of education in your university lectures and agricultural field experiment reports, definitely not! (4) Who is "honest and without deception." In my previous letter, I refuted Mr. You's words. Yes, I recognized that "most of the upper-class elements are greedy for power and wealth, and the shop assistants and workers are still honest and without deception" (this is borrowing Mr. You's words, and I agree with it very much, although my words are not exactly the same as Mr. You's words). Mr. You said "I am arbitrary" and defended himself: "You must know that there is good and evil, wisdom and foolishness everywhere, and you must never use poverty and wealth as the standard." In fact, this is the fact. I am not saying that there are no one or two good people, honest and without deception, among the scholar-officials. (This kind of ingredient also needs to be discounted), but the vast majority are greedy and snobbish; I am not saying that there are no a few bad people among the shop assistants and workers, but the vast majority are honest and without deception. Moreover, saying that the rich and upper-class elements are not good is not my new invention. Didn't the ancients say "those who eat meat are vulgar?" Didn't they say "full of brains and fat bellies?" Didn't they say "in a high-minded family, ghosts peep into their rooms?" Didn't they say "high sorghum and embroidered articles" have no good children? As for Mr. You's letter of the 8th defending: "I said that the villagers are relatively honest," which is different from the previous letter; the previous letter said: "The villagers are honest, and there is no deception by people in the city," which is a "universal affirmative" logical proposition, and there is absolutely no comparative meaning. Even if you admit that you are saying "comparatively," it also opposes the entire farmers and the entire "city" (should be said "city"). We have already said how the people in the city are above; now let's talk about farmers, middle peasants, poor peasants in the countryside, and vagrant poor peasants in the countryside. Our so-called local tyrants and evil gentry in China are close to the city and have close relationships with commercial capital, industrial capital, and banking capital, and they also have to use fraud. It is not that their parents gave birth to them and they would be fraudulent, but their social relations make them have to be fraudulent. Is this not the fact? Mr. You has been running back to China for more than ten years and has walked through many rural areas. Did he walk with his eyes closed? The rogues in the rural market cheat and take wealth, and cannibalize the poor farmers everywhere. Has Mr. You never seen or heard of them? My maternal family is a farmer, and I can say that I grew up half in the countryside. I know this better and more realistically than you. Finally, I would also like to ask Mr. You to open his eyes and turn around (this is naturally my "fantasy") and face the majority of workers and shop assistants in the city and the majority of farmers, especially the poor peasants, in the countryside. I also want to tell you that those who run from the city to the countryside, at least in Mr. You's mind, the "literate and able to write" friends, do not have the qualifications of "leaders." Their eyes only see landlords and rich farmers. They serve the landlords and rich farmers, and will never stand on the interests of the farmers and poor people to "lead" them. As for the "Mr. Liu," there has never been the word "pessimism" in the dictionary, nor has there been the three words "turn back," please rest assured, but I am very ashamed! Ideas cannot be changed, because I am unwilling to be a high-class Chinese! Also, I read the opinions of Mr. Shi Yu and Mr. Zhang Mei on this issue in the past two days, and many places can supplement the shortcomings of this article. The drama "Mad Current" staged in the cinema recently depicts the development of urban industry, overpopulation, and everyone has no way out. These are all facts, but its conclusion is to teach everyone to go to the countryside. Mr. You's opinion is completely consistent with the main conclusion of this play, which is by no means accidental. What you don't know is that the fundamental reason for the bankruptcy of the countryside is the development of capitalism and the warlord wars, heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes, etc.; after the countryside is bankrupt, the land is increasingly concentrated, and the rural population is increasingly relatively surplus. Everyone is rushing to the city. There is no way out in the city, but everyone wants to (naturally our "idealists" are thinking) advocate returning to the countryside. They are unwilling to think about the inevitable fate of the future of capitalism, and they dare not think about it, and naturally they dare not make further solutions. Then, there is only turning back! I have more to say, so I will add a few words to ask the readers what they think?</p>
<p>Correction: There are several places in yesterday's Reader Consultant that should be corrected: (1) "Then I realized that Mr. You is a 'pro-Japanese...' agricultural expert!" The sentence "We discuss things and reasons, it is useless to carry the resume on our backs, we have to see what you are showing" is missing below. (2) "Which generation of rich farmers are they 'dear classmates'?" should be changed to "Which class of farmers do they belong to?" (3) The word "commercial" in "As for China's agricultural economy, in the capital and commodities of imperialism and the commercial capital of this country" should be deleted. Communication procedures (1) State full name, age, gender, native place, occupation, detailed address, (2) Attach sufficient return postage stamps, (3) Affix communication stamps in the upper corner of this column. The facts stated in the letter must be simple and clear. The handwriting must be clear. All those who do not attach sufficient return postage stamps and do not state the detailed address will not be replied to, except for those that can be published in this column.</p>

<p>The municipal government ordered all schools to comply</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government believes that the remuneration of primary school teachers is meager, and during this period of high living standards, most of their children are unable to afford tuition. Municipal primary school teachers have petitioned the municipal government several times, requesting that the children of primary school teachers be admitted to school free of charge, which has been approved by the municipal government. It is now known that the treatment of private primary school teachers in this city is even lower than that of municipal schools. Therefore, Ke Xiaojiao teachers have requested the same reduction and exemption of tuition fees for the children of private primary school teachers, citing the example. After discussion by the Municipal Education Committee, it was decided that the request was true and should be approved to show equal treatment, and the municipal government ordered all primary schools to comply. All children of municipal and private primary school teachers will be admitted to school free of charge.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Guanghua was defeated and won four games in a row</p>
<p>Pudong won against Shanghai Middle School and turned defeat into victory</p>
<p>Four games today</p>
<p>In the middle school basketball game yesterday, there were two games. In the first game, Shanghai Middle School declined after being smooth, and was caught up by Pudong all the way, which led to a slump, and lost to 50 to 16. In the second game, Fushi was strong and well-staffed. In the first half, it overwhelmed Guanghua by 33 to 6. In the second half, Guanghua was able to cheer up, and the difference was very small, but unfortunately it lost too many points in the first half, so it could not save the overall situation, and finally lost to 62 to 28. From then on, Fushi maintained a record of four wins in four games in the Hai group, and won the right to the final with the winner of the Shang group. Based on practical speculation, Fushi has the highest voice for winning the championship. The scores of the two games are listed below,</p>

<h3 id="e170">The Tennis Department of the Chinese Athletic Association Begins to Recruit Members <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The tennis court is located at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hartung Road</p>
<p>In the future, it will be necessary to purchase land to build a clubhouse</p>
<p>The sports club National Recreation Club initiated by Cheng Yize, Li Baojun, and more than twenty other people, as previously reported in this newspaper, had an initial Chinese name that was once named "Huahui", which seemed not quite appropriate. It was later cancelled and changed to the Chinese Athletic Association, which first established a tennis department. The club's funding is very secure. Originally, Dong Dayou, the architect who was one of the initiators of the club, designed and built members themselves, but this was stopped due to the lack of land. However, it is still in progress and plans to purchase land. Currently, in view of the tennis season having arrived, an open space at the intersection of Temple Road and a certain road was found. It was borrowed from the landlord Shi Liangcai for the purpose of being this [club's] tennis court. Membership recruitment is underway, and Xu Zhendong, Li Shijun, Zhang Yuelian, and dozens of others have already joined.</p>

<p>1000 Points to 683, Beats Marks, Today the Second Week, Bernal vs. MacSherry, A Pair of British Experts Compete for the Quarterfinals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Group A Billiards Competition, with sixteen participants, completed the first week's program yesterday when Zhang Yingda defeated Marks. The second competition will begin today. The first to be rotated is Bernal vs. MacSherry, both of whom are experts among the British expatriates.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Marks Loses to Zhang Yingda Due to Smooth Technique <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Marks' loss yesterday was expected, but the distance in the difference was due to Zhang Yingda's smooth technique. At the beginning of the match, Zhang Yingda took the lead in every move, and Marks followed step by step. The difference in scores was quite close, and the order of precedence did not change. In the first half, Zhang only led by 500 points to 420. By the time it came to the second half, Zhang repeatedly created huge numbers such as 48, 24, 53, 30, etc., and surpassed the enemy with a distance of more than one hundred and fifty points. In the last section, Zhang's performance was even more brilliant, and he continued to see huge numbers such as 59 and 69, advancing at twice the speed. Marks panicked and sat watching the gun, unable to make progress. Before long, Zhang finished the first week's program with a victory of 1,000 points to 683.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Highest Scores of Two People <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>

<p>MacSherry met Walter in the first week, but the latter abstained. MacSherry entered the second week without effort, resulting in today's battle with Bernal at 5:30 pm. MacSherry's skills are slightly inferior to Bernal's, but Bernal always regards him as a formidable opponent and refuses to deal with him carelessly. Today's situation is that people think Bernal can take the upper hand, but there are those who say that once MacSherry is progressing smoothly, he will be able to hold on to the end. It is difficult to predict the future strength and weakness.</p>

<p>Last night in the Chinese Youth Fitness Room, in the standard volleyball game, Group A had Shanghai vs. Zhenru. The meeting of two heroes was brilliant, but unfortunately, Zhenru's lineup was not good, resulting in failure. Nanshang met Dahua yesterday, but Dahua's strength was slightly weaker, so they were defeated by Nanshang's fierce attack with a score of 0 to 2. In the second game, Jiangwan B vs. Wanzhi, unfortunately, Wanzhi did not appear for some reason. According to the competition, winning or losing is a common thing, but the spirit is the most important thing. Once you join the competition, you should have a beginning and an end to show the sports spirit. I hope the teams pay attention to it. Attached are the results of last night as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Nanshang wins against Dahua (B) 3丨16 3丨10 ··· (2 to 0)</p>
<p>(2) Jiangwan B wins against Wanzhi (B) (Forfeited) (2 to 0)</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>After the repeal of Prohibition in the United States, I heard that their former Undersecretary of State, Mr. Kessel, gave a speech in Philadelphia, interpreting the Stimson Doctrine, which is known throughout the world, of not recognizing "Manchukuo" in a new light. He believed that this doctrine did not eliminate the possibility that the United States might recognize "Manchukuo," because when the doctrine was initially announced, it did not state that the United States would never recognize "Manchukuo," and so on.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Kessel's reversal, nothing in the world cannot be reversed; because many negative words often do not include the phrase "never." For example, when sentencing a criminal, saying that his crime is unpardonable; if you were to reverse and distort it, you could say: "Unpardonable" does not mean "unpardonable forever"; unpardonable today does not mean it cannot be pardoned tomorrow; unpardonable now does not mean it cannot be pardoned in the blink of an eye. Also, if the words "No Urinating" are written on a plastered wall, you can urinate against the plastered wall. If someone questions you, you can say: "There is no word 'never' on it," which shows that when it was written, people were not allowed to urinate, but now that time has passed, there is a possibility that people are allowed to urinate."</p>
<p>In fact, intending to cancel a previous statement means that even if there is the phrase "never," it is useless; in the Qing Dynasty, a major punishment for officials was called "never to be employed," which seemed that there would never be a day of employment; but the person who was punished only needed to be good at scheming and lobbying, then, the first step would be to request the government to revoke the phrase "never," and the second step would be to become an official again in a grand manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Kessel, could it be that you drank a few more glasses of beer after Prohibition was lifted, which led you to say this drunken talk? You drank American beer and were only temporarily intoxicated, and you will have a clear day soon; if you drank Solar Beer, then it would be terrible! It would be terrible!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Long Live Qin Shi Huang! <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhihen</p>
<p>"Collected all the weapons in the world, gathered them in Xianyang, melted them down to make bells and bell stands, and twelve bronze statues, each weighing a thousand stones, placed in the palace." When we read these sentences in the Records of the Grand Historian, Biography of Qin Shi Huang, we understand the Emperor's intentions at that time. Qin Shi Huang unified the world by force, and he was afraid that some people would not accept him, revolt against him, and overthrow his throne of myriad generations of emperors, so he restricted weapons among the people.</p>
<p>Although Qin Shi Huang has been dead for two or three thousand years, his body must have long turned into dust; but his doctrine and spirit are new for all time. Don't you believe it? Recently, there has been an example, let me tell you:</p>
<p>"The British disarmament draft only stipulates that China has 100 airplanes." Although China's land is not large, it is not small either. What is the use of 100 airplanes in national defense? However, the modern world, abandoning Qin Shi Huang, only allows you to have 100 airplanes, dare you not obey? If you make more demands, you must be careful that the modern Qin Shi Huangs will suspect you of having ulterior motives, suspect you of expanding your armaments, wanting to turn over, wanting to make things difficult for them, wanting to overthrow their throne of world hegemony. (Note: There is more than one modern Qin Shi Huang, it is said that there are five, called the Five Great Hegemons.)</p>
<p>The following paragraph was in a certain magazine: "There are between 3,500 and 5,000 commercial airplanes in the United States...and the number is increasing rapidly." Oh dear! Commercial airplanes already have such an alarming number, and the military airplanes are conceivable. Moreover, commercial airplanes can be transformed into military ones.</p>
<p>Someone asked me: "Comparing the numbers 100 and 3,500, is the area of the United States 35 to 50 times larger than that of our country?" I said: "Idiot! There is another reason in this. The Qin Palace may as well put the twelve bronze statues, but we common people are not allowed to hide even one iron nail in our homes. It is already 'imperial grace abounds'."</p>
<p>The spirit of Qin Shi Huang is immortal! Long live Qin Shi Huang!</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>We Chinese people are bound by thousands of years of ethics and education, so love between men and women is always shy and coy. Except for behind the crystal curtains and beside the trellis, they are never willing to show off affectionate and tender expressions in front of people. Europeans and Americans are more liberated than we are in everything. In public, men and women can hold hands, kiss, hug, and dance without anyone being surprised. Moreover, they have considerable research on love. Love experts have written hundreds and thousands of books, such as "What Men Must Know" and "What Women Must Read," which are read by every household and regarded as golden rules. Men go out to work in the office before 9:00 am and return home after 4:00 pm. If they don't see each other for a day, they will be very affectionate and talk and laugh at this time. Women who are good at being graceful will play a love song after dinner and sing along in a melodious voice, giving their husbands a very pleasant spiritual comfort after being tired all day. Even if they suffer some stimulation or have some depression in their hearts outside, it will disappear invisibly at this time. However, in recent years, the golden country | America | has also felt the tide of depression, and there is a lot of overproduction and unemployment. Those unemployed men, bored and depressed, stay at home all day long. Women feel that their husbands staying at home all day not only does not increase love, but also has the possibility of causing cracks, because affection is difficult to maintain, and the materials for talking and laughing are easily exhausted. Moreover, when they are bored, their moods must be extremely bad. When their moods are bad, they feel that everything is annoying, so the two sides can easily quarrel. Instead of letting love break down at this point, it is better to find a way to maintain it as soon as possible. Therefore, the women's associations in the United States have discussed this issue in detail. As a result, a sacred rule has been set: All unemployed men are not allowed to spend their time at home all day. They still have to go out before 9:00 am and can only come back after 4:00 pm. Therefore, most of those unemployed men hide in small coffee shops in the countryside all day long, singing songs to vent their sorrow. Sometimes they bring a few pieces of coarse bread and run to the mountains and waterside, dazed and silly; performing their art of madness, it's really pitiful!</p>

<p>Chapter Four: The Emotional Situation Reopens, the Teahouse Tilts, and Feelings Accumulate, the End of the Year is Difficult to Pass, and the Pawnshop Sounds of Lament</p>
<p>He saw the old girl from afar, and his heart was full of hope, and he was no longer angry, so when he walked back to his own door, he held the brim of his hat and nodded slightly. For some unknown reason, such an ordinary nod from Ji Zhi made him feel so happy, as if he had gained something from the sky, many times more joyful. For seven or eight days, no matter what he did, he was unhappy, and this was happiness. The next day, Ji Zhi met Gui Zhi head-on on the way home. Gui Zhi was not carrying anything, and did not seem to be buying anything. Moreover, it was almost at the end of the street, and there was no need to come to this place to buy things. He saw that she had a tattered scarf around her neck, and her hands were in her pockets, huddled into a ball. Ji Zhi blocked her face-to-face and said: "Old girl, it's so cold, where are you going?" Gui Zhi replied casually with a very unhappy expression: "Buying something." Ji Zhi smiled and bowed slightly and said: "Old girl, are you still angry?" The old girl smiled faintly and said: "Second Master, how can we bear to say that? What kind of people are we? How dare we be angry with Second Master?" Ji Zhi sighed and said: "It's hard to say, you have to forgive me a little. I'm eating my brother's food now, how can I disobey my brother's orders?" A new milk tea shop has opened at the end of the street. They are from Beijing, and they don't know the people on this street very well. Let's go and have something to eat and talk about it. The street is very cold, and you don't put on any clothes. You came out of the house, be careful of catching a cold." Gui Zhi was originally walking face-to-face, and she could not help but turn around and walk after speaking, and suddenly replied to Ji Zhi: "I'm not cold! I'm not going!" Ji Zhi was met with such a harsh rebuff, what else could he say? He put his hands in the pockets of his overcoat, lowered his head, and walked behind Gui Zhi. Gui Zhi walked twenty or thirty steps ahead and then looked back at him. If they were going home, they should turn at the intersection of a diagonal street, but Gui Zhi did not turn, and kept going straight ahead, which was exactly where Ji Zhi said that a new milk tea shop had opened at the end of the street.

<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>After ten years of study, I earned a colorful, yet useless, graduation diploma. The diploma sits on the shelf, but somehow, business has come along. Thirty-one days in a long month, thirty days in a short month, a salary of forty yuan, a wife, children, high heels, milk powder, the nineteen-column abacus can't make ends meet. Crying to heaven is no use, so the nineteen-column abacus has a stroke of genius and finds a way to make money. Pick up a writing brush, dash off a long article, seriously submit it to the newspaper's editorial office. One day, two days, three days, damn it, the position is taken by the great writer of special contributions. What to do? Ancestral virtue saves me, after ten or eight days, the tile turns over, the editor finds my work in the corner of the drawer, and the printer typesets it without a single error. □ yuan □ jiao □ fen □ li can be included in the budget. But, alas, "a little is better than nothing" is one saying, and "a drop in the bucket" is another. What to do?</p>
<p>"First prize, four hundred and twenty thousand." Haha, fortune has favored me, and I've stumbled into a life of ease. Slowly, the lottery hasn't been drawn yet. No, I'm afraid not to buy it, I spent ten shiny silver dollars, so at least there's a one in one hundred and ten thousand chance of hope. Farting and blowing on fire, perhaps there is such a coincidence in the world. I found a jiao (1/10 of a yuan) walking yesterday, luck is coming, and if I add nine yuan and nine jiao, tighten my belt, save money, and buy a ticket, heaven will not disappoint those who work hard. One, two, three, four, five, six, all six numbers are correct. Piles of colorful, diploma-like banknotes are carried home. This is something to be happy about.</p>
<p>Buying lottery tickets is gambling and can foster a gambling mentality. I can't accept that label. Fortunately, this is charitable in nature and shouldn't be equated with gambling. Whoever wants to get rich is doing good. If you're missing teeth and have a runny nose, you get two benefits at once. There are so many poor guys like me in the world, working as clerks, doing literary begging, never dreaming of earning eighteen thousand in a lifetime. Only by enthusiastically doing good and buying champagne can you catch small fish and then big fish. Fellow comrades who want to get rich, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Thoughts After Visiting the Industrial and Railway Exhibition <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Yi Zhi</p>
<p>The National Chiao Tung University held an Industrial and Railway Exhibition. All the newspapers in Shanghai had detailed reports, causing a national sensation and a time of great prosperity. During the Qingming Festival in the old calendar, I also took the opportunity of a holiday to visit. The exhibits were dazzling and beautiful. Unfortunately, I'm not an industrial expert. For various machine structures and their principles, even after detailed instructions by internal staff, I still couldn't fully understand them. However, I will briefly mention my thoughts as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Domestic Automobiles: Promoting domestic products should start from a broad perspective. In recent years, many business giants in China have been ambitious about domestic goods. However, their own cars and the transportation vehicles needed for the circulation of domestic goods are all purchased from abroad, which doesn't seem to be a fundamental solution. Only the Shenyang Mortar Factory painstakingly researched and manufactured several trucks, which meant that domestic automobiles could be produced in large quantities from now on and there was no need to rely entirely on foreigners. Unexpectedly, during the September 18th Incident, the factory was destroyed, and all the self-made trucks were looted by the violent Japanese. Only one, which was transported to the National Roads Association for display, is now displayed again at the Industrial and Railway Exhibition. We no longer hear of similar domestic automobiles being produced. Seeing this luckily surviving relic, one can't help but feel sentimental and sigh!</p>
<p>(2) Water Pumps: In recent years, the urban population has been increasing day by day. The only reason is the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Farmers cannot support themselves and have to seek a living in cities. However, the reasons for the bankruptcy of the rural economy are nothing more than floods, droughts, wars, and the lack of improvement of agricultural tools and seeds. I grew up in the countryside and know the situation well. For example, in years of severe drought, in addition to using hand-operated waterwheels to draw a small amount of water for irrigation, one can only pray to heaven for rain. The exhibition has water pumps displayed by the China Iron Factory and the Aurora Iron Factory. It is said that irrigation of fields is a hundred times more efficient than manual water scooping. The one I saw was a four-horsepower water pump, priced at about a hundred yuan. Unfortunately, the person attending it seemed to be a worker, and he vaguely answered how many gallons of water could be absorbed per minute and whether it could absorb water from a low position to a high position over a long distance, so I couldn't fully understand its effectiveness. If it could be as ideal as we imagine, its benefit to drought relief would be significant. I hope those engaged in rural undertakings will pay attention to it, which is also a way to save the rural economy.</p>
<p>(3) Comparison of Highways in Various Provinces: In the exhibition section on national road achievements, there is a comparative chart of highways in various provinces, with red lines indicating completed highways and green lines indicating planned but uncompleted ones. The length of red and green lines is the longest in Guangdong and the shortest in Jiangxi. I think that transportation convenience is directly proportional to cultural development and inversely proportional to rampant bandits. The banditry in Jiangxi has been spreading endlessly, is it because of this? As a Jiangxi native, I can't help but feel ashamed. I still remember that during the January 28th Incident, the enemy reinforcements arrived quickly like divine soldiers, while our reinforcements were transferred from southern Jiangxi, detoured through Zhejiang and Quzhou, and walked for a month before reaching the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Therefore, I can't help but hope that the authorities will actively complete the national highways to help with foreign affairs. (4) Others: Most of the exhibits at the exhibition are machine industries, such as English typesetting machines, which only require one person to type and can automatically cast the required characters, saving time much more than manual typesetting. In addition, such as electric motors, transformers, and various locomotives, are all great and ingenious. Unfortunately, they are all products of foreign machine factories, and our country is far behind. I hope that the Chinese people will rise up and catch up, so that the saying of saving the country through industry will not become empty talk!</p>

<h3 id="e188">Dissent on "Killing the Wrong Person" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Gan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Cao Juren's article "Killing the Wrong Person," I felt very happy, but thinking back, I felt that some of it was still inevitable talk of anger, so I wanted to raise a few objections:</p>
<p>After the Xinhai Revolution, Yuan Shikai massively killed party members. From Yuan Shikai's perspective, he did not kill the wrong person at all, because he was a fake revolutionary and a counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>What was wrong was that the revolutionaries were deceived, thinking that he was really a somersault, changing from a Beiyang minister to a revolutionary, so they introduced him as a comrade, shed everyone's blood, and floated him to the presidential throne. By the Second Revolution, on the surface, it seemed that he was another somersault, changing from a "public servant of the people" to a blood-sucking demon, but in fact, it was not. He was just showing his true colors again.</p>
<p>So, kill, kill, kill. In Beijing, even the hotels and inns were full of detectives; there was also the "Military and Political Enforcement Office," where only suspected youths were seen being sent in, but they were never seen walking out alive; also, in the "Government Gazette," there were advertisements every day for party members leaving the party, saying that they had been pulled in by friends before, mistakenly joined the party, now they knew their mistakes, and would leave from now on, to wash their minds and become good people.</p>
<p>Soon it proved that Yuan Shikai did not kill the wrong people, he wanted to be emperor.</p>
<p>This matter has been twenty years in the blink of an eye. The young people in their twenties now were still sucking milk then. Time is so fast.</p>
<p>But, Yuan Shikai wanted to be emperor himself, so why did he leave his real enemy, the old emperor? There is no need for much discussion. Just look at the current warlord melee to know. They fight to the death, as if they are irreconcilable, but in the end, as long as one "steps down," they will be polite to each other. However, for revolutionaries, even if they have not fought, they will never let one go. They know very well.</p>
<p>So I think that the Chinese revolution has become like this, not because they "killed the wrong person," but because we saw the wrong person.</p>
<p>Finally, I also have a little objection to the proposal of "killing more people over middle age," but because I am already "over middle age," to avoid suspicion, I will just look at the ground.</p>
<p>Fishing Platform and West Platform</p>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Yan Ziling's Fishing Platform on the Fuchun River has recently had a stroke of luck, favored by modern women; many Shanghai celebrities have made a special trip to Qililong to visit it. The cliff is very high, the mountain road is very narrow, climbing from the foot of the mountain to the top is covered in sweat; a few broken houses, a few broken steles, there is nothing good to see, so they return in disappointment, thinking "there is no reason." For the sake of "elegance," they can't say the suffering: I have been to the place where Mr. Fan Wenzheng has been, which is worth it, so there is a poem as proof.</p>
<p>People who visit the fishing platform are mostly good at research: how did Mr. Yan fish on such a high platform back then? Everyone studies how long the fishing rod is, how long the fishing line is, maybe they discuss how many fish can be caught every day. They treat Mr. Yan as a humorous fisherman and think of many interesting fishing methods for him. But Fan Hua doesn't do good, and the Book of the Later Han says: "There is a man, wearing a sheepskin coat, fishing in the marsh." Too little poetry! Too little poetry!</p>
<p>Connected to the fishing platform, there is another dangerous cliff. Fabricated archaeologists say it is Jiang Taigong's Fishing Platform: nine out of ten passers-by in Qililong are Jiang Taigong's party, supporting this saying. They say: "The perch on the Xunyang River is the seed of Qililong; one day, Jiang Taigong caught a perch, shook it hard, broke free of the hook, and flew to the Xunyang River." That perch was probably a pregnant woman. As far as I know, it was the West Platform where Xie Gaoyu beat the zhu (ancient stringed instrument) and wept in pain at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, with the Record of the Weeping on the West Platform recording this painful event of national demise.</p>
<p>Xie Gaoyu naturally cannot win the favor of Shanghai celebrities; what does it matter if the country is destroyed, they can still enjoy themselves happily, to come to such a scenic place to beat the zhu and weep in pain is the number one fool in the world. So the Southern Song Dynasty is only six or seven hundred years away from now and has long disappeared from people's memories; while the elegant ancestor two thousand years ago is remembered by people thousands of years later and has recently had a stroke of luck. It can be seen that it is best for ancient people to be sensible and know how to have fun. People in the Southern Dynasty were already praising the scenery of Fuchun endlessly. In Wu Jun's Letter to Song Yuansi, "The wind and smoke are all gone, the sky and mountains share the same color, drifting with the current, freely east and west, from Fuyang to Tonglu, more than a hundred miles, the strange mountains and beautiful waters are unique in the world." This is such a desirable place. Light rain, heavy fog, new moon, dawn, the taste of this, the man wearing a sheepskin coat fishing in the marsh, he understands and enjoys it very much! Unfortunately, we were not born at the right time, and when we should be climbing the West Platform to beat the zhu and weep in pain, we are still not allowed to "drift with the current, freely east and west"!</p>
<p>Dance</p>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>The white electric light went out lazily. Tempting dim light leaked from the modern ceiling. This light was so dazing and mesmerizing. Following this light spread in the space was the music of the popular Fox-trot dance. So one by one, flattering and proud men used the most fashionable posture in the social scene and walked towards those dancers. Two by two, young men and women rotated on the glittering floor, with light smiles floating on their faces.</p>
<p>He was sitting. His eyes jumped among these rotating people. Watching and listening, he pressed his breath slowly, because he wanted to suppress his heartbeat. He remembered the first time he went to the dance hall with Lao Huang, he was also so panicked by the heartbeat. He said that such carnal temptation was disgusting, and Lao Huang laughed at him for being too pedantic. Good-hearted friends happily forced him to learn, and he, who was very smart in reading, was also very smart in this regard. Friends taught him a few times, and he was already dancing pretty well. Tonight, Lao Huang didn't know where he got the idea and pulled him along again. He was so panicked again. Waves of fragrance, one by one, half-naked bodies, twisting in various poses, made his every nerve tremble slightly. He smiled bitterly. He looked at Lao Huang hugging a short dancer, skillfully moving his steps with the rhythm of the music. Lao Huang's face was floating with a greedy smile, and most of the faces of other men also had this greedy smile. He felt a kind of embarrassing disgust, but the music stopped at this time.</p>
<p>Lao Huang took a sip of tea and looked at him with a proud eye. "Come on, the one in the red dress just danced very well."</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"Are you going to be pedantic again? What's the matter?" Lao Huang said, smiling triumphantly. He wanted to say something more, but was stopped by the music. Lao Huang went with the music again. The light shed from the ceiling changed from light green to light purple.</p>
<p>The air became more and more fragrant, and also mixed with the strong taste of champagne. The intoxication of wine, the intoxication of flesh, smeared those greedy faces with a layer of blush. But his emotions slowly calmed down. When the music sounded again, he also walked to a dancer like others. She was wearing long hair that had been ironed by a top barber, and a thin gauze dress covered her well-proportioned body. He moved his steps subconsciously, and his heart jumped subconsciously again. Now he saw clearly the faces that often pretended to be delicate, with a layer of dim wrinkles faintly hidden under the powder, and the bewildered eyes contained a dim bitter smile. The wheels of the city devoured her into this appearance.</p>
<p>"Ah, behind the joy, such a bitter smile flashes?" he said in his heart. Following the music that slowly quieted down, he lowered his head and returned to his original seat.</p>
<p>Red light leaked from the ceiling again.</p>

<p>Flower Gambling</p>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>"Ban Gua Cai in Fang Maolin, Taiping Shengshi Xu Yuangui, Fengchun Deshi Zhu Guangming, Huoguan Liancheng Lin Genyu..." Not to mention the bumpkins in other places, even five or six-year-old street urchins can recite the Flower Gambling rhymes by heart. "What a pity, a good Zhang Huoguan, hesitant and indecisive, sadly gave up!"</p>
<p>"Still need to talk about it? Last night I dreamed of a house on fire, so accurate. For some reason, he went to bet on Li Mingzhu. Why strike the clams when you can strike the turkey? Where did that come from?" In eight out of ten villages, there were gatherings of men and women. In the morning, they talked about dreams, at noon they waited for news, in the afternoon they discussed Flower Gambling lore, and in the evening men and women mingled and went to deserted temples and graveyards to pray for dreams. Some even stole from the bodhisattvas, picked up corpses, and made gambling wagers by weighing them, steaming them, and other unspeakable things.</p>
<p>People are seven parts ghost-like, talking ghost stories endlessly, filled with the idea of getting rich quick. Everyone is a character from the Legend of the Obsessed with Wealth, where is there any humanity left? Strange news emerges one after another. Obsessed with wealth, cutting off their own son's head, chopping off their own daughter's arm to bet on Flower Gambling has become a commonly told tale.</p>
<p>The gambling opens every day, paying out thirty times the stake. It's simple, and the profits are high, no wonder it's sweeping the countryside, old and young enthusiastically participate. Inoue Koubai, a Japanese who is known as a "China expert," once used wine, mahjong, and opium as symbols of China, and wrote a thick book, grandiosely telling the Japanese people. This treasure came to China, gambled heavily, patronized prostitutes, exclusively fraternized with hooligans, and colluded with thugs, messing around in the underworld for a while, and then thought that China was such a country. At first, when I saw that book, I was really angry. But what's the use of being angry? Not only are the petty citizens in the city decadent and unbearable, but now even the farmers in the countryside have learned to speculate and take advantage of opportunities. Everyone has a heart of adventure and luck. The title of the country of wine, mahjong, and opium has become truly deserved. A nation that has decayed to this point, where is there any hope of revival!</p>

<p>The Crossroads of Era and Love</p>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"In case I participate in a demonstration parade this afternoon and am caught by the running dogs of imperialism, then I will have absolutely no experience with the opposite sex."</p>
<p>Such a self-deprecating thought further prompted his expression to her. He felt hot all over. He hugged her neck at this moment.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin!..."</p>
<p>She just smiled foolishly. Her body seemed to be softening. When he saw her pursing her lips to express herself to him, he hugged her tightly like a hungry eagle catching a small sparrow.</p>
<p>Afterward, he also felt that kissing the opposite sex was not so tasty. He seemed to smell the fishy smell of her saliva. He thought, could it be that she ate canned sardines this morning.</p>
<p>Thirty-Three</p>
<p>When he arrived at Tang Yaoxing's residence, it was a quarter past twelve. He saw only a young man with a peaked cap on his head, a blue cloth long gown on his body, and a pale face sitting in Yaoxing's room. The whole room was cold and clear, not like a place for group meetings. Haiquan greeted the young man, but did not ask his name, and sat down on the edge of Tang Yaoxing's bed in a grand manner.</p>
<p>"Where did Lao Tang go?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked half to the young man and half to himself.</p>
<p>"He will be back in a moment."</p>
<p>The young man answered him very readily.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Tang Yaoxing came back after a moment. As soon as he saw Haiquan, he questioned Haiquan in a very imposing manner.</p>
<p>"Why don't you obey the rules?"</p>
<p>"Didn't I come?"</p>
<p>Haiquan replied with a smiling face. At first, he only thought that Yaoxing was joking with him, but looking at Yaoxing's pale face with a stern look, which had not loosened at all, he restrained his smile, but held a little resentment in his heart.</p>
<p>"I told you to come here at twelve o'clock, why didn't you keep the time?"</p>

<p>Guangdong Merchants Fiercely Dump About 3,000 Bars</p>
<p>The Spot Price Briefly Rises to 1,100 Yuan</p>
<p>A Deluge of Bad News Causes Prices to Break Below 90 Yuan Again After Closing</p>
<p>The gold market experienced a significant downturn yesterday, mainly due to reports that U.S. Secretary of State Hull had proposed three ways to increase silver prices, causing widespread anxiety. Although London spot prices rose nearly 1.25 pence and forward prices rose 1.875 pence, New York silver prices surged 6.25 cents, with forward prices rising even more sharply, soaring over 8 cents. Private telegraphic transfers rose to 8.125, and American cotton also increased by four points, causing the gross price to drop to 934 yuan, before rising to 78 yuan. The market opened at 1,095.8 yuan in the morning, and the exchange rate also opened strong, causing prices to fall. After the Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced its rates, with both the British and American exchange rates increasing by only 1.25 pence, the exchange market tightened slightly, and prices rose slightly. However, the afternoon session saw a small drop. The market opened steadily in the afternoon, but then banks' appetite improved, and the spot price rose, stabilizing sentiment and briefly surging to 1,100 yuan. However, with Bombay initially rising nine annas, followed by another three annas, and news of a silver price conference circulating from foreign sources, the exchange rate remained strong, and the gold market continued to decline, closing at 1,091.3 yuan. After the market closed, news of further actions favorable to silver prices in the United States emerged, causing prices to break below the 90 yuan level, with the downward trend remaining strong. Throughout the day, the market situation was difficult to support. Guangdong merchants fiercely sold approximately 3,000 bars (handled by the Tuota firm). The spot price initially opened at an additional 15 to 16 yuan but rose to 18 to 19 yuan due to demand from other merchants. The swap spread for April and May was 4 yuan and 4.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Here is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1,095.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 14.6 yuan from the previous close. The spot premium opened at 5.5 yuan. The exchange market opened with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 3.125 farthings, and the American exchange rate at 20.5 yuan, both stronger than the previous close. Initially, Shangping, Yuanmao, and Yongshun readily absorbed the selling, but due to spot arbitrage (dumping by Guangdong merchants), prices fluctuated around 6 yuan. Later, the June U.S. dollar at 8.125 was difficult to sell, and Shenkang immediately dumped it on behalf of the Guangdong merchants. Hengxing, Qianchang, and Xiang also sold, causing prices to gradually decline. Hengyu sold even more, bringing the premium down to 1.5 yuan. Mitsui bought up the June U.S. dollar at 8.75, and Fuchang and Yuanheng competed to buy, bringing it to 4.5 yuan. HSBC sold the June U.S. dollar at 8.75 to Zhejiang, and Yifeng sold to 2.5 yuan, which Zhifeng bought, stabilizing the price. Citibank bought up the July U.S. dollar at 21 yuan, and Fuchang bought again, bringing it to 5 yuan. Tianfeng Yong then entered the market to sell, bringing it down to 3 yuan. At this time, HSBC's published rates were finally revealed, with both the shilling and the U.S. dollar increasing by 1.25 pence, which had little impact. Shenkang continued to sell bars aggressively, but because the exchange market seemed favorable, sentiment stabilized. Fuyu and Yongfeng both bought, and banks sought to settle the May U.S. dollar at 6.875, bringing it to 6.5 yuan. Tongyi again sold bars on behalf of Hengxing, bringing the price down to 5.2 yuan, but because Hengxing reversed course and bought, and Yuanmao and Wanxing also bought, the premium rose to 6.7 yuan, as the May U.S. dollar at 6.25 was difficult to settle. However, Tongyi continued to dump, making it difficult to support the gold price. Fuyu and Yifeng Yong also sold, bringing it to 3.5 yuan. Citibank bought up the July U.S. dollar at 9.375, and Yuanmao Yong, Yuanheng, Xiexing Yong all bought, bringing it to 5.5 yuan. After this, the market situation was stable. Although Fushun and Zhaofeng Chang bought, because Shenkang sold all the spot goods, the market fluctuated. Qingfa Yong and Zhaofeng Chang came to sell, causing the market to become unsustainable, and the market situation appeared confused. Fuyu also sold, bringing the premium down to 1 yuan, but because Dadecheng bought bars, the price returned to 3.4 yuan. Hengxing entered the market to sell bars, and Yuanmao Yong also sold, making the market outlook bleak again, gradually declining to 0.6 yuan. The afternoon session closed at 1,091.3 yuan. After the market closed, buying suddenly surged, gradually bringing the premium up to over 2 yuan, and the spot premium was then quoted at 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1,093 yuan, with the spot premium opening at 2.8 yuan. Dadecheng took the lead in buying, causing the premium to rise to over 4 yuan. Maijia Li bought up the August U.S. dollar at 0.0625, and Yuanchun and others bought even more, bringing it to 5.4 yuan. Qianchang Xiang and Yuanmao Yong then sold, and then Huabi sought to cover the May U.S. dollar at 6.25, and HSBC also sold the current month at 5.625, bringing the premium down to 3.8 yuan. Dadecheng and Yuansheng Yong bought again, and the trend remained favorable, rising to over 5 yuan. Zhifeng Yong, Fushun and Hengyu bought even more, bringing it to 6.8 yuan. Huabi released the June U.S. dollar at 75, and Fuchang came to sell bars, bringing the premium to 5.6 yuan. Maijia Li bought up the July U.S. dollar at 9.375, and Hengyu and others bought again. At this time, due to news of rising spot prices, those buying bars tried their best, bringing the premium to over 7 yuan. However, the upward trend did not stop there. Maijia Li bought even more of the July U.S. dollar at 8.75, and Fuchang and Qianchang Xiang bought up to 9 yuan, and Zhaofeng Chang bought even more up to 100 yuan. Dalian merchants smoothly sold, bringing the premium down to within 9 yuan. Hengxing also sold, bringing it to 7.2 yuan, and then Huabi released the July U.S. dollar at 8.75. Before long, Citibank hedged the July U.S. dollar at 8.75, and Fuchang bought in again, bringing it to 9 yuan. The Bombay telegraphic transfer reported a rise of nine annas, bringing the premium down to within 7 yuan. The downward trend was quite quiet, and then the July U.S. dollar at 8.75 was difficult to sell, bringing it to 6.2 yuan. Subsequently, retail investors bought bars, pulling it up by 1.5 yuan. At this point, it was extremely quiet. Then, the second Bombay telegraphic transfer reported another rise of three annas, Yuanmao Yong took the lead in selling, and Richang also sold, causing a downward trend to begin. Furthermore, news of a forthcoming silver price conference from foreign sources emerged, and Ruixing entered the market to sell, causing the premium to fall to 3.5 yuan. Huabi bought up the July U.S. dollar at 9.375, bringing it to</p>
<p>Over 5 yuan. However, there were many sellers, and the price remained unsustainable. However, Hongli once set a limit price to buy bars, supporting the price around 4 yuan. When the July U.S. dollar at 9.375 was no longer needed, Hengyu and others came to compete to sell, bringing the premium down to 1.5 yuan. Not long after, the market closed at 1,092.6 yuan. After the market closed, sentiment was bleak, and Hengyu continued to sell, bringing the price down to within 90 yuan. Retail investors fled in panic, bringing the premium down to 87 to 88 yuan, but the spot premium had already been quoted at 91.5 yuan. The highest price for the day was 1,100 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,090.6 yuan, a fluctuation of 9.4 yuan. The result was a drop of 17.8 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Due to the Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation (HSBC) exchange rate quotation of the U.S. dollar rising by 1.25 pence, the alloy price was over 1,192 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 100 yuan short of the mark, more than 10 yuan higher than the previous close. The book price for the current month was 1,097 yuan, for May was 1,091 yuan, the water supplement in the morning was 1,092 yuan, and in the afternoon was 1,094 yuan. Trading remained active. In summary, Shengyi Da, Hengxing, Shenkang, Tianfeng Yong, Tongyi, Ruixing, Hengyu, Yifeng Yong, Fuyu, Richang, and Yuanmao Yong were the main sellers, while Fuchang, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Fushun, Yuanmao Wanxing, Shunli, Zhaofeng Chang, and Zhifeng Yong were all buyers. Dalian merchants were slightly net buyers. Guangdong merchants (Shengyi Da) sold a total of over 1,000 bars, and Hengxing sold over 400 bars (Shenkang allocated 1,050 bars to Shengyi Da, and Tongyi allocated over 400 bars to Hengxing and Shengyi Da combined). Total transactions for May amounted to 18,389 bars.</p>
<p>Yesterday, only 14 public silver drafts (for April) were delivered, with Yongfeng and Yingfeng Heng each delivering 7, and Tongfeng Heng and Chang Yong each receiving 7. Due to the decline in the term premium price, yesterday's spot market initially only added 15 to 16 yuan, and trading in the market was quiet. Gu Fengheng once accepted a flat price, which was sold by a silversmith, priced at an additional 16 yuan. Later, the price gradually rose. In the afternoon, Dadecheng sold 350 taels to Yingfeng Heng, priced at an additional 18.5 yuan. Yingfeng Heng was buying goods on behalf of merchants from other regions. After that, merchants from Tianjin were still keen to buy at an additional 19 yuan, because the term premium price was low, and the source of supply was scarce, so the trend seemed stable. The swap market was extremely quiet. Only Runchang Yu paid Dadecheng 21 bars at 4.5 yuan, and Dadecheng paid Ruikang 70 bars at 4 yuan (the May transaction was Dadecheng selling to Hengyu). There were very few other formal transactions. There were 3,962 April bars remaining.</p>

<p>According to foreign news, London spot cable rose 1.25 pence, forward cable rose 1.875 pence, British to American exchange rate was down 0.375, and American to British exchange rate was unchanged. The opening bid for near-term British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 3.125 (or 3.75) farthings, about 1.25 farthings stronger than the previous close.

The market opened strong, but banks were still buying. HSBC's published rates showed that both British and American exchange rates rose by 1.25 pence. There was a brief period of tightness, but the market was still loose at the noon close. The afternoon opening was better, and banks were all buying, as the spot price was rising, and the exchange market seemed to be improving. However, this was a flash in the pan, and the market soon turned loose again, mainly due to Bombay reporting a rise of 9 annas, followed by another 3 annas. In addition, there was news from foreign sources about silver prices, and the trend continued to harden. By the close, the near-term bid for British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 3.75 farthings, 1.25 stronger than the previous close. The American exchange rate was 20.05625 yuan, 0.25 looser than the previous close. Banks such as Citibank and Maijia Li were all hedging, while Huabi and HSBC were covering. Both hedging and covering were seen in the gold industry. The daily bank transactions are recorded below:</p>

<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market, since the currency reform, although the situation appears calm on the surface, the internal procedural relationships often involve little new transactions, so the market situation is quite calm. The call loan market rate still opened at 3% in the morning and afternoon, but the head-transfer plus water slightly turned brisk, calculated at 8 to 9%. The call loan transaction in the morning was 4.3 to 4.4 million, and in the afternoon was over 500,000. The small general exchange transacted over 600,000. The silver pledge loan transaction was over 900,000. The banknote bank recovered 900,000 and issued several hundred thousand. Banks collected and delivered silver coins from foreign banks 4.4 to 4.5 million, foreign coins over 500,000, and deposited 500,000 in warehouses. Chinese banks collected and delivered silver coins 10.2 to 10.3 million and deposited 500,000 in warehouses. Money shops collected and delivered public silver drafts over 33 million, and head transfer plus water over 4.5 to 4.6 million. There were no reports about remittances from various routes over 400,000 or merchant routes. In the currency exchange market, the price for small Jiangnan silver dollars was the same at 866.5 yuan in the morning and afternoon, with a transaction volume of only 7,000 jiao in the morning. The price for small Guangdong silver dollars was also the same at 800 yuan in the morning and afternoon, with a transaction volume of 40,000 jiao in the morning and 10,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market was even more sluggish, and transactions were even more sparse. Because the war in the Northeast is becoming more intense again, the market sentiment is uneasy. Major players are completely standing aside to watch. The bulls are holding firm, and the shorts are also wary. They are mutually restraining each other, resulting in a stalemate. At the opening in the morning, the 1898 Customs Loan rose slightly by 0.1 yuan, while the rest all retreated slightly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, with some retreating by 0.4 yuan. Except for this initial market, which fluctuated slightly due to more selling on the 11th, the other three markets had few transactions and almost no fluctuations to speak of, and the trend was comparatively weak. In the middle, there were often cases where there were absolutely no transactions, or only one quoted price. This kind of quiet situation has rarely been seen recently. However, this fluctuating and brewing situation may not last long, because the number of open positions already traded is huge. If the situation changes slightly, the market price will definitely change. As a result, market prices retreated slightly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, ranging up to 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was only 3,848,000 yuan, including 30,000 yuan in spot goods and 3,845,000 yuan in futures. Among the various bonds, the largest transaction volume was the Salt Tax Bonds, which was only 960,000. The Consolidated Tax Bonds were only 710,000, and the rest were only tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand. The Disbandment Bonds were only 520,000.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that on Monday (the 10th), the New York stock market soared due to a 2% increase in steel production and retailers' expectations that the two Houses of Congress would provide good assistance to the silver mining capital stabilization plan. Trading also became more active, and silver mining stocks and steel stocks were particularly strong. Department store stocks were also very firm. American Steel Company's outstanding orders at the end of March totaled 1,841,002 tons, which was almost equal to optimistic predictions. By the end of February, the total was 1,854,200 tons. The trading volume for the day was 1.76 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Factories to Implement Production Cuts Starting April 21st</p>
<p>Agreed to Reduce Working Hours by Two Days and Nights Per Week</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. The yarn factory production cut was unanimously approved at yesterday's general meeting, with working hours reduced by two days and nights per week, starting on April 21st, which shows the difficulties faced by the factories. However, general speculators are still aggressively shorting, because their inventory base is strong, and most of them bought cotton and sold cotton yarn, so the yarn auction market is relatively weak. However, the factories are still trying their best to find solutions for the yarn market. As for the overseas yarn market, the situation is also stable.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Cotton Auction: Low Opening and Recovery in the Afternoon <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton auction this morning, the market sentiment was stable due to flat American cotton. Each month rose by 2.5 qian, but after the second and third auctions, a downward trend began again, falling by 0.578 yuan to 1.3 yuan due to dumping by speculators. In the afternoon, a certain manufacturer bought in, rising by 0.4869 yuan to 1.1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 51,800 bales. Xin Chang sold 1,600 bales, Shen Ji sold 1,600 bales, Ren Feng sold 1,800 bales, Yi Da sold 1,300 bales, Chang Feng sold 1,300 bales, and Yi Chang sold 850 bales. Yong Da sold 1,050 bales. Rong Xing bought 1,400 bales, Ji Feng bought 1,400 bales, Ming De bought 1,400 bales, Li Chang bought 2,550 bales, Yi Yu bought 1,650 bales, and Xie Sheng bought 2,350 bales.

<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but the market sentiment was firm. Due to the purchase of cotton by a group of speculators to arbitrage cotton yarn, the more the market fell, the more buyers there were. However, manufacturers were very reluctant to purchase raw materials due to the sluggish yarn market and reduced working hours, and most of them predicted that American cotton would rise.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Zheng raw cotton auction this morning, the market was down due to the poor yarn market. Each month fell by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan. In the afternoon, each month rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 55,500 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm at first due to good news from Liverpool and a lack of sellers, but then retreated slightly due to some long positions being closed.

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supply was from the 10th to the 20th, and the city and rural shops were active. The market situation was fresh. The prices of rice from Suzhou and Tongbang and Nan'gang, etc., rose by half a corner. The commission issue was resolved. Tianjin merchants actively bought over 1,000 shi, and the market situation also appeared to be tightening. The price of thin rice and early rice from Qingjiao Bang and Songjiang, etc., gradually rose by several fen to that extent. Du Yang's top-grade rice was stable, and Du Jian's top-grade rice was tight and in demand. The price of Yin Yuan (silver dollar) was not lightly taxed.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) There were 45 to 46 ships from various routes. The white japonica rice shops skillfully purchased slightly, and the market trend was short, losing nearly a corner. Thin japonica and early rice also continued to arrive, but zero sales were not smooth, and prices were weak. Xian rice was stable, and Yin Yuan was in short supply, and Bai Yuan (paper currency) was also several fen tighter.</p>

<p>| Ke Xian is Actively Transforming Again |</p>
<p>Yesterday, 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were released, sold by Anli, and purchased by this street. This batch was old rice. The price at the beginning of the month was 8.2 yuan. Yesterday, the price fell slightly by 0.2 yuan to 8 yuan, which stirred up sales on this street. There is still a possibility of continued activity after this. However, a new batch of Saigon No. 1 rice arrived, but because the goods were broken, the foreign merchants asked for 8.15 yuan. This street previously ate 8 yuan and was only willing to inquire within 8 yuan yesterday, a difference of over 0.2 yuan, making it difficult to conclude a deal. Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice from the Fujian gang was active again, with over 1,000 bags sold. Various grades, such as the early and late oil refined red rice of the engine, were all inquired about, but all were small tickets for 100 to 200 bags. If there are big ticket transactions again today or tomorrow, the market price may be able to change. Yesterday, the market atmosphere was active, and the prices were stable. Throughout the day, the Quanzhou gang purchased 126 bags of Wuhu Engine Yuan rice, the Fuzhou gang purchased 460 bags of Jiangxi late and early rice, and 1,100 bags of Hunan rice, and the prices were similar to those previously opened.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market showed a slight decline in prices for both near-term and distant months. Trading was flat in the morning, with only 50,000 to 60,000 bags traded. In the afternoon, sellers were buoyant, and prices gradually fell, but the transaction volume increased, totaling about 150,000 bags. Although some long positions were sold in the morning after the opening, the market could still be supported due to lower reports on foreign wheat and the purchase of spot flour and near-month contracts by the real sales gang. In the afternoon, both the floaters and the loose mills were selling, and many individual long positions were being unwound, causing prices to fall again and again. Although customers were inquiring, it was difficult to stop the decline. The final closing prices were down 0.015 yuan for the current month, down 0.0125 yuan for the next month, down 0.0175 yuan for June, and down 0.015 yuan each for July, August, and September.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market showed a slight decline in prices for all months. In the morning, foreign wheat was reported to be up 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, but the gold market was down, making it cheaper to draw together (draw together = exchange transaction), and both sentiment and the market showed a decline. However, the line mills continued to make fixed orders. However, many of the fixed monthly periods were still to arrive, and the previously fixed near-term deliveries were gradually arriving, so the fixed lines were very active in throwing away for hedging. Both the short positions adding leverage and the long positions closing out were even more active. In the afternoon, there were even more sellers, and prices fell sharply across all months. The closing prices were down 0.03 yuan for the current month, down 0.07 yuan for July, down 0.05 yuan for August, and down 0.06 yuan for September.</p>

<p>Since the National Government issued the order to change "tael" to "yuan," the oil market had been sluggish for many days. This was because the commission firms and their clients had not reached an agreement on the deduction for tare weight under the new system. Consequently, the firms convened a meeting to discuss re-implementing commission and tare weight rules, but the clients vehemently opposed this. As a result, the market has been at a standstill. However, a small number of firms were still secretly engaged in transactions. It is heard that yesterday, 70 lots of light-tare oil were sold at 14.20 yuan, and 50 lots of Zh岐 bean oil were sold at 14.40 yuan. The market situation is much better than the previous humiliating state.</p>

<p>(Golden Needles) The current market price for top-grade golden needles is 21.50 yuan. Da Xing brand is priced at 20 yuan, and Yang Hua brand at 19.50 yuan. There is a slight improvement due to some purchases from the Guangdong traders, and the situation is relatively stable. (Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber) New products have already appeared on the market, selling for 25 yuan, while old products still sell for 16 yuan. Sales are mainly limited to the local area and inland regions. The Shantou traders have made some small purchases. (Xiangtan Lotus Root) The stock in the production area has been exhausted. There are not many shipments arriving in Hankou, and they are being sold at 80 yuan. However, the new crop is still some time away, and people's expectations are firm.</p>
<p>(Quanzhou Large Bubble Rounds) Due to abundant accumulated inventory and sluggish sales, the market has been weak for many days and has not yet opened for trading.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Xueliang boarded a ship to go abroad the night before last. Many important figures from the National Government saw him off. We should also board the ship to see him off. The National Government officials' farewell represents the government's intention, while our farewell represents the general public's sentiment.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang was a hereditary king of the Northeast. Under the "non-resistance policy," he gratuitously surrendered the four northeastern provinces. Now, he is comfortably going to Italy. It is fortunate that he did not also surrender Tianjin and Beiping before leaving, which shows his good sense. However, we truly admire Mr. Zhang's spirit of "what's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine." Not only do we Chinese admire it, but many foreigners also admire it. I saw in a Western newspaper that a bronze statue should be cast for Mr. Zhang as a god of world peace. Therefore, I believe that Mr. Zhang will definitely receive a grand welcome from foreigners on this trip abroad.</p>
<p>But everyone already knows Mr. Zhang's past great achievements, and there have been many congratulatory articles about him. I won't add more superfluous words of praise. However, regarding this trip abroad, there are still two accounts that Mr. Zhang should clarify before leaving:</p>
<p>1.  Before leaving Beiping, Zhang Xueliang, without authorization, sold the entire land and buildings of the Haibu Tianjin Hospital school site to the French Concession authorities where the medical school was located. After Haibu noticed this, he repeatedly telegraphed Zhang to stop it, but received no response from Zhang.</p>
<p>2.  Zhang Ji telegraphed Mayor Wu on the 8th, saying that upon reading the newspaper, he learned that Zhang Xueliang was about to leave the country by ship. Although the bronze ware of the Summer Palace had been moved south, many ancient calligraphy and paintings from the garden were in Zhang Xueliang's possession. He suggested that they should be promptly retrieved and detained so that national treasures would not be lost overseas.</p>
<p>Regarding the two matters above, not only should Zhang Xueliang clarify them before leaving, but the government should also make Zhang clarify them before allowing him to go abroad. (1) The school site has already been forcibly occupied by the French Concession authorities, who led French soldiers and police to seize all the buildings of the school. Besides submitting separate petitions to the Supreme Military Authorities and the Executive Yuan to protest to the French, the National Government should cancel this unlawful contract of confusing jurisdictional systems and selling state-owned property to foreigners without authorization, and punish Zhang Xueliang for the crime of selling state-owned property to foreigners without authorization. If this matter is not resolved properly, it could cause a major dispute between China and France in the future, another calamity created by Mr. Zhang Xueliang, and another great achievement granted by Mr. Zhang Xueliang. (2) Regarding the Summer Palace calligraphy and paintings mentioned in the telegram, it is unknown how many books are in the Summer Palace collection. Mr. Zhang Xueliang should provide a clear statement, indicating how many items he took from the Summer Palace. If he does not clarify this, if some unscrupulous people follow Mr. Zhang's example in the future, everyone will blame Mr. Zhang, and you will have no way to defend yourself. This is something that Mr. Zhang should clarify. Furthermore, from the government's perspective, they should also make Zhang Xueliang clarify this matter before allowing him to go abroad, because these are mostly our national property, not private property. If anything is missing, the people should have the right to audit the government's accounts. Therefore, the government should not allow Zhang Xueliang to take these national treasures privately. Moreover, according to Zhang Ji's telegram, although the bronze ware has been moved south, the calligraphy and paintings are mostly in his hands. If the common people are ignorant and misunderstand, thinking that this is clearly a division of spoils—I take the hard and heavy items, and you take the soft and light items—a kind of harmonious cooperative action.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>How will the government explain this? Based on these two points alone, the government should not allow Zhang Xueliang to take the calligraphy and paintings away. Of course, with jackals and wolves in power, who cares about foxes? Zhang Xueliang's crime of humiliating the nation and losing territory has not even been investigated. Why should we bother him with mere ancient calligraphy, paintings, school land, and property? The government has a broad network of laws, treating the people and their possessions kindly, which is truly unprecedented and unparalleled in the world. However, if this is the case, everyone will emulate Mr. Zhang Xueliang: everyone gives away land, everyone takes things. Since there is a precedent to follow, everyone might as well emulate it. I ask, what kind of country will this become? I am not dissatisfied with Mr. Zhang, but I am truly sorry for the country.</p>
<p>What is even more laughable is that before leaving, Zhang Xueliang made a so-called statement, saying, "Although I resign and go abroad, not concerning myself with military or political affairs, as a member of the nation, I have a duty to both the country and the world. I will return home soon to fulfill my responsibilities." I ask, readers, think about it, are these words suitable for Zhang Xueliang to say? Mr. Zhang held important positions for many years and completely surrendered the four provinces of our country. Where was his duty then? Is it that one does not need to fulfill one's duty while in office, but only as a member of the nation can one fulfill one's duty? And he says he will return home soon to fulfill his responsibilities. Is it that he did not need to fulfill his duties before, but only after going abroad can he fulfill them? Ah! I understand now. Mr. Zhang's so-called duty and fulfilling his responsibilities refer to the duty of surrendering land, the duty of privately selling school property and stealing objects. Mr. Zhang's duty has been fulfilled enough; please don't bother to worry about it anymore.</p>

<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, one sees that social news of deaths in various ways is recorded almost every day; in fact, in the eyes of some people, it's as ordinary as the death of a dog!</p>
<p>"Ah! Oh no! Is someone about to be run over?"</p>
<p>As I was wandering at the entrance of the lane where I lived, a milkman on a bicycle collided head-on with a speeding motorcycle. Needless to say, the milk and bottles were all sacrificed. Then, a white-haired old man was thrown into my view, lying on the ground rolling around, his mouth uttering intermittent cries of pain! The bicycle stood there as if stunned, staring blankly at the old man. Soon, a crowd of onlookers gathered around.</p>
<p>"Hey, friend, are you still in pain?" The motorcyclist understood that in the real world, only power matters; anyway, power is justice. So he boldly continued, "Haha, what are you crying about? You should be glad I didn't break the car window; if I had, you wouldn't be able to afford to pay for it. At least ten taels of silver for a piece, you know, this glass is genuine imported stuff."</p>
<p>"Ya...oh...it hurts so much! Hurt..." The old man kept pressing his hand over the blood flowing from his mouth, crying out in pain.</p>
<p>"Hmm! You're making sense? Look, he's bleeding! You don't seem to hear his cries? Alas, you hit someone and you're still being stubborn?" Indignant, I "reprimanded" the motorcyclist, hoping that he would be more careful driving next time. But, as a result, he adopted the attitude of a so-called "gangster"!</p>
<p>"Sir, don't be fierce. I've been driving for many years. This kind of small thing, humph! What does it matter?" "Then why didn't you honk your horn? This is the entrance to a lane, you know?"</p>
<p>"Hehe, not honking the horn?" He said coldly, "What's so strange about that? My boss is a foreigner. He doesn't honk the horn even in the 'middle of the road', let alone for someone like you."</p>
<p>"Oh? You're really trying to rely on foreigners to justify your unreasonable behavior? You traitor! Everyone, look at how arrogant he is!"</p>
<p>"I'm scared to death. My teeth were knocked out, three of them, three! My clothes are torn to shreds."</p>
<p>"Hateful, drag him to ××!"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Lu A'qiao, no, I don't agree. What's ×× all about? Maybe the old man will be fined. I say, make the motorcyclist pay some money and send him to the hospital." The crowd argued in various ways as above.</p>
<p>Everything is like this, no matter how big the matter is, there will always be an end. Soon, everyone dispersed, only the pile of blood was still red! But in a while, the cleaner will come and sweep it clean, and it will disappear without a trace.</p>

<h3 id="e212">An Unswallowable Grievance <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a weak and ignorant woman. When I was seven years old, my father passed away, leaving my mother and me behind. Since then, life has been very difficult. Fortunately, I have my uncle to rely on. I am now twenty-three years old. When I was seventeen, I was studying at a certain middle school in Shanghai. Although my uncle was generous in providing me with tuition fees, he was very stubborn. He thought I was old enough and that Shanghai was a confusing place. He believed that a woman with some basic education could establish herself in society, so why seek further education? Therefore, I dropped out of school. Later, through my uncle's friend Mr. Zhu, I was introduced to a bookstore as a sales clerk, where I met a colleague, Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang was very knowledgeable and his character was not bad, so I often asked him for advice, and Mr. Wang taught me diligently without getting tired of it. Over time, our friendship turned into mutual understanding. Mr. Wang was not yet married and repeatedly proposed to me. I thought Mr. Wang was very sincere and I could rely on him for life. I discussed it with my mother, who also thought so, and we made a lifelong agreement, happily and passionately. My will was very weak, and love led to a physical relationship. Later, I repeatedly urged him to get married soon and start living together. Mr. Wang postponed it due to economic constraints. Who knew that as a result of the January 28th Incident, the bookstore closed and Mr. Wang and I had to separate. However, we still communicated by letter from time to time. Recently, for the past three months, Mr. Wang suddenly changed his ways, stopped writing letters, and when I wrote to him, he did not reply. After inquiring repeatedly, I learned that he had broken his previous promise and became engaged to Miss Zheng and married her on the twelfth of last month. When I heard this, my heart was like a knife. I went to argue with him, but he claimed that it was his parents' order and he could not refuse. When I went again, he avoided meeting me, leaving me with tears flowing onto my pillow. Later, my uncle found out and questioned me constantly. What face do I have to answer him? Now Mr. Wang used seductive means to lure me, causing me to lose my chastity, and finally abandoned me halfway, leaving me with a茫茫future. I am a weak woman, how can I deal with him? If I let it go like this, how can I swallow this grievance? The only way out is to commit suicide, but suicide is despicable and useless. Should I resolve it through legal means? But the verbal agreement is not documented, and it is unknown whether the crimes of breaching a marriage agreement and rape can be established. Therefore, I sincerely ask you, sir, to open a bright path and help me resolve this matter. I believe that you, sir, are dedicated to society and will definitely grant me guidance. Respectfully requesting your peace, Lu Kunzhen respectfully writes.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading Miss Lu's letter, we feel that that thing named Wang is truly guilty of heinous crimes; starting with affection and abandoning her at the end, he not only places Miss Lu in what situation, but insults the entire female gender to what extent? If we let it go so easily, not only will Miss Lu be unable to swallow this grievance, but for the sake of the safety of the entire female gender, we also feel indignant.</p>
<p>"Chicken skin cannot be patched onto a duck's body".  The result of negotiation definitely cannot allow Miss Lu to once again enjoy happy circumstances; or, in this stubborn society, the result of publicizing may have repercussions against Miss Lu, we are also aware. But Miss Lu's sacrifice is, after all, a small matter, all the more so, she is already a person bearing wounds. Therefore, we hope Miss Lu to use her already trodden self, for the sake of the entire female's future, to risk a fight to the death with this beast in human skin. Below are two solutions:</p>
<p>Nominally, the current world has progressed and does not allow you to take revenge privately. You should file a lawsuit with the court, at least charge him with the crime of "causing someone to mistakenly believe there is a marital relationship and allowing him to commit adultery." Sentence him to three or four years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Because the world's progress is merely nominal; the result of the lawsuit may not be satisfactory. At that time, it is society that owes you, you should rise up to exercise "the right of self-rescue." Seize an opportunity to confront him with blades in hand. In order to vent this grievance, in order to let out the breath for the entire female gender, any sacrifice is worth it.</p>

<p>Among this group of refined people, there was an even more refined gentlemanly middle-aged man. His somber complexion and listless demeanor simply disqualified him from being a snow appreciator.</p>
<p>"Wu! Look, the snowman they built looks just like that French old lady who teaches with you, except it's missing a pair of glasses!" Wu Yi was brought here today by Ju Fen, just like singing "Man Going to Prison." Every time there was a lively gathering or something relatively new and interesting to discover, Ju Fen always took the initiative as the most enthusiastic participant. This was not only because she was younger, but also because she had grown up in a very happy family since childhood. As for the current environment, she had a husband who was very good at making money, a lively and lovely son, and, mysteriously, she also had a special and noble lover... Happiness, at least, was not treating her badly.</p>

<h3 id="e215">"The Art of Thighs" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xian</p>
<p>It's Hollywood's Knocking Brick</p>
<p>It's the Female Star's Family Ability</p>
<p>The new films from Soviet Russia are promoted with the slogan "There are no thighs here, no sex appeal," and surprisingly, during this time of national crisis, when people are feeling drowsy, it serves as a stimulant, seeming to cause a different kind of stimulation. A film without thighs, or even without women, can still be made, but a woman without a pair of shapely, mysterious, and seductive thighs is not popular, especially in Hollywood. The art of thighs "Legart" is something that newly arrived actresses must possess, because when they first arrive, all people can see is their pair of thighs, as for whether they have performing talent, that is the second step. This is the golden rule of Hollywood, and no one can defeat it. Currently, the generally famous actresses, such as Jean Harlow, Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford, Helen Twelvetrees, Clara Bow, Nance Carroll, Alice Joyce, Kay Francis, etc., have all passed through this level. Even now they can't give up their family ability, and they must show them off from time to time, showing how a pair of jade legs account for more than half of a woman's body, and is naturally very important.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich usually wears men's trousers, covering up her pair of slender, moderate, and well-proportioned thighs, causing many movie fans to feel sorry for her. Mary Pickford also likes to dress in men's clothing, causing her thighs to sigh with the desire to be revealed. But they have already become famous by relying on their thighs, and even though they do this, no newly arrived actress dares to jump out of this range and become famous without relying on their thighs. Now it is said that there is a new actress in Hollywood who claims to break Hollywood's "bad rules," not relying on the sex appeal of her thighs, but to become famous for her acting talent. Whether her revolutionary undertaking will succeed in the future is still uncertain, but the difficulty of her advancement is probably ten times that of others.</p>
<p>"The Art of Thighs" is also a special skill of photographers. Every new actress, after signing a contract, is immediately led to a photo studio, where all parts of her body are photographed in various ways. One purpose is to enable the director to decide how to shoot her figure and attitude in the film, and the other purpose is that these photos can be distributed to newspaper reporters as the best publicity material. Of course, photos of thighs are most welcomed by newspapers. When photographers take photos, they must also use their ingenuity greatly. Thighs that are slightly fat or slightly thin can be made perfect by using the position, direction, and lighting arrangement, as well as post-processing. This is also a kind of "Art of Thighs."</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e216">Talking About "The Return of the Sword" Again <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>The films recently shown by Guotai are purely romance dramas. Their styles are all good, often displaying considerable "reason" and "righteousness," and perhaps also carrying a part of "ethics." It is clear that this is the progress of the American screenwriters' thinking, as they have already realized the mistakes of previously shooting blind love dramas of "money" and "lust."</p>
<p>The story of "The Return of the Sword" is the beginning of a quadrilateral love, but it ends with a triangular love. Such a seemingly complete but not complete ending is naturally likely to cause unhappiness among some viewers. In fact, such an ending adds much poetry and increases a lot of aftertaste.</p>
<p>There is not much to talk about in terms of the theme. Anyway, the director and screenwriter are quite clever. Of course, there should be many things that can be put in the main drama before the entire film unfolds and after the ending, but we know that this is not an easy task. So they straightforwardly cut off the beginning and end, making it a poetic work. From the beginning of the young couple's discord to the departure of her later husband from the United States, everything about how the young couple got together, why they were discordant, and what the ending of the two men and one woman was is not shown. Indeed, if it were shown, one careless mistake could contradict the original drama and cause a big mistake. So rather than praising their high skills and unconventional thinking, it is better to say that they are good at taking shortcuts. But in terms of art, this kind of taking shortcuts is meritorious and well-intentioned.</p>
<p>Speaking of technology, Gold Country's films have always maintained the world's highest honor for photography, lighting, set design, sound recording, and everything else. This film is no exception. The editing is also good. Although there are some disconnections in it, they are not major flaws. There is a little too much dialogue, but it is a film with the beginning and end cut off. If there were even less dialogue, it would be even more inexplicable.</p>
<h3 id="e217">"White Gold Dragon" Was Not Disapproved <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 7th), this publication carried a major work by Hacker Feng Jun: "White Gold Dragon" Was Not Approved. According to this news, it was indeed a rumor. The film "White Gold Dragon" was inspected by the Film Censorship Board on the 6th. Because the dialogue in the film was a mixture of Shanghai and Cantonese, and most of the committee members were from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, they had difficulty understanding the Cantonese dialogue. Therefore, it was decided to submit it to the general meeting for discussion, and the Tianyi Company, which submitted the film, was asked to provide the dialogue and lyrics of the film for clarification. Therefore, whether "White Gold Dragon" is approved or not will only be confirmed after the general meeting decides. However, we have seen that the "Lost Love" film of the Star Film Company also uses both Shanghai and Cantonese, and it did not encounter difficulties from the Film Censorship Board, so I think "White Gold Dragon" will definitely not be disapproved either.</p>
<p>As for the performance, perhaps Ruth Chatterton's portrayal of the abandoned wife in "Laughing Lady" left us with too good an impression, so this time we felt she was not as good as before. However, in this film, her understated performance is very fitting. The supporting actors Battle Davis and George Brent, one playing a lively and romantic youth, and the other playing a thorough gentleman, are both perfect.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say that the translated title of this film is very good. The original title cannot summarize the plot and the color of golden assets is too heavy! So heavy that it loses its meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Regarding the Two-Seater Eastern Car in the Film "Madame Butterfly" <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I was born in Japan. I spent more than ten years there in my childhood. However, I have not carefully studied the history and customs of that country. Of course, I am not a Japan expert. However, when I was a child, when I was happy, I would also watch Japanese movies, stage plays, ancient plays, etc. I have also seen the stage play "Madame Butterfly", but there was no Eastern car that was a two-seater.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, Japanese Eastern cars are even narrower than Shanghai rickshaws. It is impossible for two people to sit together. Even if they wanted to, the police would interfere. If two burly Westerners were to sit together, it would be even more impossible.</p>
<p>What I know is what I have observed daily, which is only a small part of the reality. Now that the editor has asked Mr. Ling He to reply based on the facts, let us wait quietly for Mr. Ling's reply.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Reply and Statement <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>－Regarding "Madame Butterfly" and "Asian Storm"</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yuan raised several questions about "Madame Butterfly" in this publication a few days ago. Because the editor wants me to reply, I will reply to the best of my knowledge as follows:</p>
<p>It is true that there are no rickshaws in Japan that two people can sit in, and Westerners certainly do not have this privilege. Of course, this is because the author of the film does not know much about Japanese customs. Not only that, but also in the film, the master calls the maid by her last name (Suau) instead of her first name, which should be a transliteration of the Japanese "Suzuki" or "Sasaki". This is also not in accordance with Japanese customs. Perhaps there are other oversights, but I can't remember them for the moment.</p>
<p>In the article "Review of Asian Storm", a few sentences in the first paragraph were completely printed in reverse order. Now, in order to avoid misunderstandings, I will copy a few sentences from the original manuscript as far as I can remember:</p>
<p>"...Secondly, this film was once translated as "National Soul", which was even remade with the content changed, and a flag with a blue sky and a white sun was added at the end. However, is this not the revival of "National Soul" now?"</p>
<p>This means that the national flag was added to the previous "National Soul", not the current "Asian Storm".</p>

<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>Due to Filming in the Rain</p>
<p>The Tianyi Company recently filmed a "Vitality", directed by Shao Zuiweng himself, starring Chen Yumei, and co-starring Lu Lixia, Yuan Meiyun, and Zhang Zhenduo. It is now known that the film was completed a few days ago, and the first half was privately screened in the Shanxi Grand Theatre. However, although the film has been successfully completed, it has suffered the leading actress Chen Yumei, who fell ill due to overwork in filming this "Vitality". Because the last few scenes of "Vitality" were all rain scenes with heavy rain, Chen Yumei had to run back and forth in the rain, and the plot of the play was in the summer, so she only wore a thin long coat. In this chilly spring weather, wearing a thin coat is already unbearable, and at the same time, cold water has to be sprinkled on the body, so it is no wonder that she fell ill.</p>

<p>— Plum Blossom</p>
<p>The time is 1762, after Catherine II deposed the Russian Emperor Peter III and established herself as empress.</p>
<p>This wise and talented woman felt that the incompetent Peter III was not capable of dealing with strong neighbors such as Turkey and Poland for the sake of the country's destiny. After ascending the throne, she used her talents, and Turkey was defeated, and Poland was divided, but she suddenly felt an indescribable depression. Ah, an empty depression, she only felt that the young and beautiful Count Orlov was lovable! For this reason, the court was filled with hostility towards her and opposition to her, especially Count Shuvalov, who was Orlov's enemy. Of course, he had a lot of resentment and jealousy towards Orlov's favor. So the conspiracy to overthrow Catherine was underway, and the assassination plot of Orlov was being planned. The palace was filled with a solemn atmosphere, but in another world it was quiet and pitiful.</p>
<p>"Dong, dong...dong!..." The bells in the monastery, dragging out long tones, played a cold and lonely sorrow in the quiet air; the cold and beautiful Princess Posoti spent such a miserable day, she forgot this lively world, disappointed her beautiful youth, she, resignedly recited scriptures and prayed in the monastery, who knows that she is a princess, who knows that she is the daughter of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna!</p>
<p>Although no one knows, the disgraced Count Shuvalov is an exception: because he knew about this person, and once, carrying a heart full of hope, he secretly sneaked into the monastery, and said to Bodi in a serious and earnest manner, "You, you are the daughter of Empress Elizabeth, this whole Russian Empire belongs to you, get up, overthrow Catherine, we will all support you." But Bodi's heart, like the water in an ancient well, will never ripple again!</p>
<p>Catherine was a resourceful woman. She felt that the people in the country had a very serious attitude towards her, and, moreover, she and Orlov should not let their affair become an open secret, so she summoned Count Orlov to the palace and asked him to lead the army to the front line to conquer Turkey: although she felt a little uncomfortable in her heart, when she thought of the danger of her position, she had to say goodbye to him with tears in her eyes.

<h3 id="e223">The 1933 Automobile Queen Citroen Eight-Horsepower Car Arrives in Shenxu <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Now Displayed at the Fada Automobile Company's Showroom</p>
<p>The Citroen Automobile Factory, in order to meet the needs of people in the global automotive industry, has specially introduced a small car with eight horsepower starting in 1933. It is exquisite and of excellent quality. This new car has now arrived here and is displayed in the showroom of Fada Automobile Company. Those who go to visit it every day are like those on the Shanyin Road, coming and going in an endless stream. According to reports, this new product has also won the honor of Automobile Queen. Now, its process is briefly described as follows, to share with readers.</p>
<p>The annual French Automobile Exhibition has closed in October of last year. The number of visitors reached more than 300,000, which shows the great magic of the exhibition and the public's interest in the automobile manufacturing industry. In this grand exhibition, the dazzling details cannot be described in detail with pen and ink. What is described here is an eight-horsepower Citroen car that has just entered the world. The car is placed on a small seat surrounded by bright lights. Although there is no decoration, those who surround it and watch it stop and do not move. As a result, it gathers more and more people and becomes the most lively part of the exhibition. According to the person in charge of the exhibition, no visitor does not first ask where the car is located. Its magic is unprecedented. After admiring the car, the audience unanimously voted it as the Automobile Queen of the exhibition. There are hundreds of brands of vehicles participating in the exhibition, but the eight-horsepower small Citroen car can stand out. Can this be regarded as luck? The car body and the small seat on which the car is placed are illuminated by long-range colored lights. A kind of delicate and exquisite appearance and the bright paint color of the car body complement each other and make it more moving. The chrome-plated parts installed on the car body are even more dazzling and make people unable to look directly at them. Some interested people compare it to a swan bath. All 1933 Citroen vehicles have a swan floating on the water painted on the license plate, indicating that the engine is like a swan floating on the water, light and unparalleled. The Automobile Queen, although decorated in a fashionable way, is not like the queens of the world, who specialize in dazzling people with extremely valuable and gorgeous ornaments. However, once the viewer sees it, he will have a longing feeling, as if it contains mystery. So the audience suspected that it was an eight-cylinder car. However, once it was explained that it was an eight-horsepower car, not an eight-cylinder car, the audience could not help but gasp in amazement and praise it. The reason for this is the effect of the buoyancy engine.</p>
<h3 id="e224">New News About the "Double-耐克勞夫" Diesel Engine <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Succinct Study Declares Success</p>
<p>This season's diesel engine types are complete and all-inclusive. The largest is a six-cylinder, seventy-five horsepower, turning one thousand times per minute. When the horsepower is increased to one hundred and twenty, the maximum speed can reach one thousand six hundred times per minute.</p>
<p>The smallest of its engines is nine horsepower. Among its new products, this is the most interesting. Among the several most popular styles of "Double-耐克勞夫", there is one that is small and easy to use, called "Pocket Style". This smallest diesel engine is similar to its mother.</p>
<p>The cylinder diameter is four inches and the stroke is six inches. Generally speaking, the suction cylinder is equipped with a flexible valve, pressure gauge, and automatic filter.</p>
<p>The needle valve injector is installed upright in the cylinder head and sprays into the spherical combustion chamber. The combustion chamber is connected to the cylinder by a single hole. Its structure has undergone many tests.</p>
<p>Equipped with a 皮耐氏 fuel suction cylinder and injector. The suction cylinder is on the frame on the left side of the engine and is pushed by a cam. A spring piston is placed next to the suction cylinder. The intention is to prepare the fuel pipe route before starting.</p>
<p>The machine is started manually at the front end of the engine. The gear that reduces the compression pressure is installed on the exhaust valve, so that the engine rotates several times until the momentum is sufficient. Then, move the lever to fully open the pressure, and the machine will start accordingly. In terms of its 17.5 to 1 compression ratio, starting the machine can often be stable and worry-free. However, in order to prevent accidents, a safety device for starting the machine is also installed. The average effective pressure of the engine is eighty-four pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>The total weight of the engine is about nine hundred pounds. The factory's Shanghai branch (Chinese name 固敏洋行) is located at No. 3 Guangdong Road, this city, Dalaifangzi. Those from all walks of life who want to purchase the above engine will be given special discounts on the price.</p>
<h3 id="e225">The Characteristics of the Ten Horsepower Four-Cylinder Sedan New Citroen Car <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>丨Exquisite Manufacturing, Spacious and Comfortable丨</p>
<p>There are many styles and types of new Citroen cars. The ten-horsepower Citroen is one of them. This is a four-cylinder product. It has excellent construction and is extremely exquisite, so it has attracted the widespread attention of the general public. This type of vehicle is currently being mass-produced by the Citroen factory to meet the enthusiastic demand from all over the world. In order to understand the detailed situation of this product, the reporter recently participated in a test drive. Although this product is named Citroen ten-horsepower, in fact, its spaciousness and grandeur are beyond the reach of ordinary ten-horsepower models. Its wheelbase reaches eight feet ten and a quarter inches, so the assembled car body is naturally more spacious. The sedan body is meticulously constructed with a single piece of steel and is supported by a particularly strong chassis frame, so it is extremely solid and durable. Even when driving at the highest speed on dilapidated road surfaces, there is no worry of rattling. The reason why the new Citroen ten-horsepower car runs so quietly has its own reasons. In addition to the above point, another reason is the special cushion frame of the engine. The method of its implementation is completely based on the principle of buoyancy, so the weight of the engine gearbox part is almost entirely borne by two points insulated by rubber. These two points, one is placed behind the gearbox, and the other is supported by the "A"-shaped horizontal frame in front of the cylinder block. This entire part of the engine is absolutely quiet and has no vibration, and it is worthy of being a great advancement and success in modern mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>The harmonic gearbox with silent two-speed gears is another prominent feature of the Citroen ten-horsepower model. Only with this device is the adjustment and shifting easier, and Citroen's ease of use and natural handling are the natural result. In addition, the spring equipment with hydraulic shock absorbers is also one of its major features. Its quality is excellent and its effect is great, so that drivers and passengers can feel unparalleled pleasure and comfort.</p>
<p>The engine system of the Citroen straight ten-horsepower new car is simple and effective. Its foot pedal and hand lever are both connected to the central main horizontal axis. This kind of engine is not only extremely sensitive and natural in its movements, but also its great storage capacity of braking force is even more outstanding and incomparable. The four-cylinder engine is a side-valve type, with a bore of 68 mm and a stroke of 100 mm. It is connected to the harmonic gearbox by a popular coupling. The steel body is strong and excellent. Its few joints are welded together as one, seamless, just like a whole piece. The chassis frame is particularly solid, so they complement each other and are extremely beautiful and perfect. In short, this new Citroen ten-horsepower product is not only far superior to ordinary so-called ten-horsepower cars, but also truly opens a new era in the automotive industry. "Fu"</p>
<h3 id="e226">Amazing American Car Accident Cases <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>－More Than 29,000 People Died Under Cars Last Year－</p>
<p>Excessive Car Speed is Most Likely to Cause Accidents</p>
<p>Pedestrians Who Are Not Careful Are Also Likely to Lose Their Lives</p>
<p>The main causes of American car accidents in 1932 are approximately the following: driving at excessive speeds, driving on the wrong side of the road, and passing without the right of way. All of the above-mentioned actions of drivers caused 16,000 Americans to die under cars and more than 535,000 to be injured last year. All of the above are from the statistics and analysis made by the American Travelers Insurance Company. Last year, there were 745,300 car accidents, 29,000 deaths, and 904,800 injuries. According to other statistics, 29,500 people died under cars.</p>
<p>According to the booklet "If You Call Us Civilized" published by the American Travelers Insurance Company, car accidents are roughly divided into nine categories. Now, the number of accidents is listed in order as follows.</p>
<p>Cause of Accident Accidents</p>
<p>Exceeding the speed limit 150,050</p>
<p>No right of way 146,500</p>
<p>Driving on the wrong side of the road 81,180</p>
<p>Driving off the road 61,590</p>
<p>No signal or improper signal 52,770</p>
<p>Robbing 24,610</p>
<p>Passing on the wrong side 10,340</p>
<p>Turning or climbing 7,350</p>
<p>Passing a stopped streetcar 4,410</p>
<p>The book also states that the occurrence of these accidents is indeed inexcusable because the driver is driving too fast. In addition, driving in the wrong direction, reckless driving, etc. are all sufficient to cause a tragedy. In short, the recklessness of the driver is the origin of all accidents. However, if this type of driver does not pay attention in time, they will inevitably suffer the consequences one day.</p>
<p>Now, let us further describe the situation of car accidents affecting pedestrians. In 1932, 12,770 pedestrians died in car accidents and 267,280 were injured. The situation of the disaster is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Crossing at an intersection Accidents</p>
<p>With a signal 11,930</p>
<p>Violating the signal 33,940</p>
<p>No signal 41,610</p>
<p>Walking diagonally 3,470</p>
<p>Crossing between intersections 74,720</p>
<p>Getting on or off a streetcar 3,420</p>
<p>Standing in a safe place in the road 950</p>
<p>Getting on and off other vehicles 3,840</p>
<p>Children playing in the road 43,550</p>
<p>Working in the road 5,680</p>
<p>Riding in a car or hitting a car 5,320</p>
<p>Walking out from behind a parked car 30,780</p>
<p>Walking on the road in the field 10,110</p>
<p>Last year, the number of pedestrians who lost their lives in car accidents was greater than in the previous year. Therefore, it is particularly pessimistic to seek mutual responsibility between pedestrians and drivers in order to reduce accidents. According to statistics, pedestrians who lost their lives due to crossing the road in violation of the signal, walking diagonally, or walking out from behind a parked car accounted for 47% of the total. The book does not want to agree with what the National Safety Council said, that since 1931, fatal car accidents have been reduced by 13.5%, which shows that the public's use of roads has been safer. According to the Travelers Insurance Company, Americans' use of roads in 1932 did not show that they had been safe due to the reduction in deaths. The book says, "Although the total number of deaths this year was 29,000, compared to 33,500 in 1931, the number of deaths or injuries per accident has actually increased. The decrease in the number of deaths cannot be compared with the percentage decrease in the number of accidents. These facts are all stated in the records of each major state. Therefore, in 1932, the mortality rate per accident increased by 1.3%, and the combination of deaths and injuries increased by 2.4% per accident. Although fatal car accidents have been reduced by 13.5%, car registration and car fuel sales have also decreased by 8% and 7% respectively. The reduction of these three items is actually due to the impact of the economic recession and should not be said to be "the public's use of roads has been more alert than before." Now let us compare the situation in 1928. At that time, the number of car registrations was approximately 24,493,000, which is similar to last year's 24,276,000. However, the number of car accidents was 1,400 fewer, approximately 5% less. As for the consumption of gasoline last year, it was more than in 1928, but this is also not enough to say that the distance traveled by private cars last year was more than that of cars in 1928. The reason for the large consumption of gasoline is that the number of registered trucks and buses last year was greater than that of four years ago. In addition, the use of old cars on the roads last year was widespread, and their gasoline consumption was also greater. Another reason is that the number of car cylinders in the market has increased, and their driving speed has also increased. All of these are clear evidence of increased gasoline consumption.</p>
<p>In 1932, due to fewer cars on the market, the accidents of two cars colliding and hitting people were fewer than in 19</p>
