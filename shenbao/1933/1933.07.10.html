<p>時評</p>
<h3>川戰影響於國家前途明</h3>
<p>國難如此嚴重。而四川鄧劉之爭。迄未稍已。全國人民籲求息戰愈急。而彼乃戰興愈高。戰禍愈烈。以素稱天府之區之川省。閉夔門而可自給者。乃至田野騷然。人民不得偷一日之安。此伊誰之咎耶。夫彼輩軍閥亦人耳。其所以蠻觸死拚者。不過欲擴張其地盤。獨不念地盡焦士。民盡枯魚。彼輩又將安所依附耶况此種行動。非特足以破壞四川一省之治安。且舉國亦將受其影響。而乃至今無悔禍之心。絕不顧及國家民族當前之急難。斯則深可怪異者也。川事之足以影響於中國前途。約有數端可言。</p>
<p>第一四川軍閥習爲縱橫之術。祇圖攬權固位。絕無絲毫信義。對於軍治下之人民。視同牛馬。祇知任情敲剥。對於中央。則佯爲尊戴。實則視命令如戏弁髦。</p>
<p>且又代表四出。到處聯絡。其用意何居。一方則極力擴充軍備。因此費用浩繁。捐稅重疊。論田賦則從前年徵一次者。今則月徵一次矣。論附加捐稅。則釐金統稅之外。益之以愛國抽捐。保商設局。抗日納稅。其他徵收及於蔬菜。苛罰細於毫髮因之農民不能安於田野。商賈不能安於巿廛。舉川省七千餘萬人民。大都皇皇然莫知所之。於是抗捐軍揭竿而起。不旬日遂遍川西南各地矣。</p>
<p>第二川民不堪軍閥之搜括。即略有幾畝薄田之自耕農。亦非但不足以自活。且并不足完納捐稅。棄地逃荒之舉。漸漸再現於四川於是共黨以數千殘敗飢餓不堪之部卒。潛入川北。在富庶多財之四川。原無彼輩駐足之餘地。而其所以能攻城掠邑。橫行一時者。非共黨之强也。乃由於川省内爭迭起民怨已深遂予人以可乘之隙、所謂爲淵驅魚爲叢驅雀是也。設使四川今後軍事上而不一反從前之所爲者。則川省共禍之蔓延。殊堪憂懼矣。</p>
<p>第三四川原爲四塞之國益以交通梗阻。更另成一世界。二十二年以來關門砍殺。於整個大局。尙無多大影響。今則時移勢易矣。蓋東北四省。旣已爲日帝國主義者之外府。我國巿塲。乃愈狹小。環伺之强鄰。莫不急欲分得盃羹。目前西藏形勢。雖似緩和而實仍嚴重。西康全省三十餘縣中。僅康定等十餘縣治。尙在我手。其餘如江達拉里早爲藏軍所占。康平寗靜亦常現不平穩之狀。川省内爭不息。則康藏問題。必將擴大。且回漢親交。爲日旣久。而新疆問題。猶不免於糾紛。迄今尙仗危機。另一種方式之侵凌。又正積極醞釀。縱令回藏之人傾心内向。其如挑撥離問者之百出其計而不已何。此後情勢所趨。首先感受此種嚴重影響者厥惟四川。</p>
<p>綜以上三端。設具其一。即足以禍害國家。矧今日之四川。同時全備之耶人民懷怨於内。强敵環伺於外。田野不辟。民無死所。又將何以善四川之後而固我邊防乎。現在中央注意西陲。顧念川政。積極之建設。一時或不易實施而消極之制止川閥混戰。則實不容稍緩者也。</p>

<h3>又以親善餌我</h3>
<p>日對華政策重加檢討</p>
<p>（東京）日本政府淸算從來追從歐美之外交政策、將其基礎轉向遠東、尤其對華政策重加檢討、擬確立確乎不動的對華方針、現在外務省大體以如下意圖應付複雜之中國政局、中國外交從來以權謀術策爲主、採用依賴他國主義、故滿洲及上海事件發生、則訴之於國聯或與蘇俄握手、企圖壓迫日本、然此計劃均歸失敗、最近似漸自覺歐美之不可依賴、即關東軍越過長城、攻到北華平野時、蔣介石派何應欽黃郛赴北平違反其從來之宣言、以直接交涉成立北華停戰交涉、華北秩序安定、而中國殊覺與日本提携、收拾時局之必要、中國態度之如此變化、實爲稀見之現象、南京政府要人中亦有極力主張中日提携、變換對日外交者、現在雖有以宋子文爲中心之反日派、然蔣介石决不致參加任何方面之一派、此事即在日本方面殊堪注目之一事也、日本對中國之外交方針、固然如中國仍不改其排日侮日之態度、則出於斷然手段、不然、中國政府變其從來對日態度、則事態如進一步伸出親日之手、則以國民政府爲正當交涉之對手、積極與以援助、（九日日聯電）</p>

<h3>六國貨幣同盟成立保持歐洲金本位</h3>
<p>法比意荷波瑞團結一致</p>
<p>預料美國亦將安定美元</p>
<p>（巴黎）歐陸六國所有全世界百分之四十八之黃金、今後在維持金本位之奮鬥中、將作一個單位、法·比·意·荷·荷蘭·瑞士六國中央銀行領袖今日在此間集議時、已决定六銀行聯結一起、防止匯價之再有漲落、在此六銀行中、任何一銀行、非先商諸他銀行、不作影響他國貨幣之行動、此次會議係秘集議、巴塞耳國際淸償銀行總裁法磊塞亦列席、此外並商定對於防止匯價漲落立即施用技術的辦法、惟會議後所發公報、未曾詳述所採方案、現信法國與其他金本位國所剩平準匯價基金雖爲數無多、尙不致如外傳之迅將告罄、</p>
<p>按金本位國銀行家會議係對美國拒絕安定匯價而發、據聞此輩銀行家接有報告、美國國内亦僅農民與若干製造家慶幸金元之跌價、此外各界對之並不熱心、現此間一般意見、認今日所組織之金集團、在美國採取不阻止金元漲落政策時、不僅可以保持歐洲之金本位、且足以鞏固六國貨幣之地位、</p>
<p>此間金融界並料金集團之組成、將成爲美國巿塲之擾亂份子、因據紐約消息、該埠全部證劵巿價因歐洲此舉而呈不安定之象、此間又聞垣街中人主張安定美金、回復金本位者漸衆、銀行家之有從事國際贸易之顧客者、聞正憂慮美金之跌價、故英國銀行家數人已預料、美國不久將開始逐漸重行安定金元、且聞近數星期來、美國資本之流出國外者、爲數殊可觀、此亦足以促成美金安定之一要素、惟歐洲銀行家此項决議之完全影響、非至實施其第一次管理方案時、不易純覩、至今日美證劵巿塲之影響、大半由於心理作用、與前途局面之不定所致云、（八日國民電）</p>

<h3>金集團之計劃</h3>
<p>防止匯價再起漲落</p>
<p>並不攻擊英鎊美元</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日用全國銀行家舉行會議、已將維護金本位之戰略計畫完全商妥、散會後發表公報、内稱、交換意見之結果、對於以充分及實際的效能給予金本位國政府主張完全維持現率金本位宣言書之方法、已全同意、出席會議諸國之中央銀行即將完成所已商妥一切詳則之技術上佈置云、</p>
<p>此次會議、由法蘭西中央銀行總裁穆賚主席、與會者有荷蘭·意大利·瑞士·比利時·波蘭·捷克·尙斯拉七國代表、及國際淸理銀行總裁法　塞、穆賚後謂出席會議之諸銀行握有世界準備金總額百分之四十、金集團維護其貨幣之計畫早有預備、俟星期一日金融巿塲開時、即將實行、</p>
<p>雖銀行家之决議、聞完全一致、然其所將施用之技術上方法現猶力守秘密、公報未曾聲明各銀行家無須其政府授以權力、實則彼等僅舉行其政府前已議定之辦法耳、彼等現將簽字於恊定書、而紀綠其政府之决議　、會議時提出兩種建議、一爲設立一種匯兌組合團體、一爲管理匯兌營業、凡外幣僅可向中央銀行購買之、聞用金國已成立一種共同基金、遇有投機危及金幣時、即用此疑維持巿况、</p>
<p>用金國聲明、此舉並非對放棄金本位之貨幣宣戰、但僅與投機奮鬥耳、六用金國已一再聲明、其意欲照現有之金比價及現有貨幣法之範圍内、維持其國内金本位之自由運用、國際淸理銀行總裁美人法磊塞之出席用金國會議、有兩重重要關係、第一因國際淸理銀行將爲用金國中央銀行之接洽與情報機關、第二因該銀行之與會、可使英美確知用金國對於英鎊與美元不存攻擊之念也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>歐洲近代文明</p>
<h3>起於貨幣同盟</h3>

<h3>日商大受打擊</h3>

<p>路透八日柏林電希特勒自接德政府與敎廷恊定簽字之消息後、已下令取消解散天主敎團體之命令、同時禁止一切反對天主敎師及敎徒之計劃、希特勒聲稱恊定之簽字、足可爲德人及天主敎徒無條件擁護國社黨政府之保障云、關於此事、副總理巴本稱、政敎之職權劃分後、將來德國可永遠不發生政敎之爭云、　　哈瓦斯八日羅馬敎廷電敎廷總理巴色里紅衣主敎於下午將近六點鐘之時、與德國副總理巴本草簽敎務條約、希特勒得信後、由電話中表示滿意、巴本發表宣言、謂「在今以前、敎務條約均由聯邦中各邦與敎廷單獨簽訂之、由中央直接簽訂敎務條約、此爲第一次、予深信此約於敎廷傳敎任務有極大價値、而於德國民族及國社黨國家内部之和平亦可維持」云、巴本將於今晚回柏林、十餘日以後再來羅馬、舉行簽字、</p>

<h3>日本經濟侵略東北一面（長春通訊）</h3>
<p>＝敦圖路的速成</p>
<p>各船綫的配備＝</p>
<p>日本侵略東三省、在軍事上算是到達了滿點、縱然還有多少義勇軍、經過無數次的苦鬥、經過了無數次的慘敗、但是還繼續保持着民族的反抗精神、再敗之後、依然再戰、不過現時巳不能和反對方面作正面的鬥爭、祇有不時的側擊、所以日本得抽出餘暇、來從事於經濟的侵略、不流血的戰爭、這就是建築敦化到圖們江岸的鐵道、本來這條鐵路即是久未完全解决的吉會路、日軍自奪據吉林以後、就毫無疑義的興工、尋常要五年纔能造成的工事、牠用一年多工夫、就把這條路造成了、就鐵路的本身講、自然是建築得不好、路基旣不鞏固、枕木也排置得不均稱、所以時常有脫軌的危險、記者乘車的那一次、一架美國製的車頭拖着十輛載重三十法噸的貨車、二輛三等客車、這些客人之中、我中國有十二人、朝鮮工人農民十八名、其餘就是七八胭管理鐵道的日人、他們都帶着手槍、警戒異常嚴重、而且沿路綫大約二百百米突以内的森林、都砍伐得光光的、充分表露着陰森的殺氣、這是因爲這條路旣條築得不好、尤其是老頭溝·哈吧嶺·一帶是出事的地方、即靠近吉林的老爺嶺附近、也是很不淸靜、</p>
<p>同時也是因爲日本人對於義勇軍反抗的行動、感着非常的棘手、在前幾天曾發生一次刧車案、日本人被殺死的有十五頭、被拉去的兩個、現在還不曉得如何結果、所以牠現在的客貨車前面都有一列壓道車、裝着鐵甲、載着小鋼砲·機關槍·步槍·手槍在前護衛、車的行程、每小時至大不過十五公里、</p>
<p>車走得這樣慢、貨品也不多、然則牠加速	度的條築這條路、又是什麽意思呢、據我們處在武力壓迫之下、圉於見聞的看法是、</p>
<p>第一·是軍事關係、在日本軍閥的眼中、大陸上最大最有力的敵人是蘇俄、牠要穩據着滿洲、　要制限着中東鐵路的發展、要超過蘇軍動員的速率、光有南滿鐵路總嫌不夠、所以牠趕快的條成吉成會路、設使日蘇間一旦發生事變、牠就可以從吉會路西封鎖滿洲里、東襲取海參崴、</p>
<p>第二·在經濟上、吉會路是東鐵東部的平行綫、拉賓路是東鐵南部的平行綫、將來延吉到三姓的鐵路成功、則中東路將完全處於被包圍的狀態之中、失去了牠本來的經濟上價値、</p>
<p>何况日本方面、現在正力圖海運的發展、羅津港雖没有建築成功、「淸津」却是可用、所以日本各輪船公司、都一齊接受政府的援助開通新航綫、其主要的航船和公司如下、</p>
<p>㈠大阪商船公司派定貴州丸·武昌丸、每週在大阪·神戶·門司·北朝鮮各港環行一次、</p>
<p>㈡北日本汽船公司、受遞信省之命、派定滿洲丸每月三次航行於敦賀與北朝鮮各港之間、同時航行敦賀與海參崴間的天草丸、也在北朝鮮各港寄港、</p>
<p>㈢朝鮮郵船公司、受朝鮮總督之命、派長白山丸每月二次航行於淸敦賀間、</p>
<p>㈣北陸汽船公司、受遞信省之命、派定北祐丸·北成丸、航行於北朝鮮各港·海參崴·與伏木間、</p>
<p>㈤島谷汽船公司、受朝鮮總督之命、派定鮮海丸每月三回航行於北朝鮮各港及北海道各港間、</p>
<p>祗就這些航船的配備和鐵道的速成、即能窺見日本要從陸海兩路去封鎖海參崴、扎斷中東路、這樣的計劃、是否能完全實現、要看我們中國的對策和蘇聯的方略如何而定、（七月一日）</p>
<h3>漢奸首領郝鵬被捕經過</h3>
<p>‖被同黨凌晨架往軍部</p>
<p>津當局電京請示辦理</p>
<p>日領妄提抗議之措詞‖</p>
<p>天津通訊、月前津變主持便衣隊、自稱華北人民自衛軍總司令之郝鵬、因與其部下分贓不均、致起内閧、已於昨（六日）晨被其副官苑某等三人、將郝用汽車架出日租界、送往第一軍團部、現正審訊中、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>（分欵不均同黨懐恨）</p>
<p>便衣隊擾亂未逞、塘沽恊定成立後、彼等知事無可爲、紛紛離津赴大連、大部分便衣隊、亦搭日輪送往秦皇島安置、其首領數人、中央及省府雖明令通緝、但因其駐居租界、無法逮捕、郝鵬於白堅武等離津後、作悍然留津、並在寳坻委任張子周等軍職、玉田已委有軍官、招兵謀亂、乃因其嗜財如命、與同夥分欵不均、致苑某等懐恨在心、於昨晨將郝送往第一集團軍部、先是郝因主持便衣隊事、得某方面欵項甚多、其部下有親信數人、分欵獨多餘二三人、對郝懐恨、乃有貪圖官廳懸賞之意、月前曾一度間接訽問中國官憲、如將郝捕獲、究能得政府之獎賞否、彼時政府中人、認係偵探行爲乃答以旣係明令通緝有案、辦案有功、當然可以受賞、政府對此事、初未置意、</p>
<h3>（夢中驚醒被逼登車）</h3>
<p>前晚郝鵬在其日租界住宅中突隨其副官苑某等捕郝之計、緣郝之左右、平日有　官六七人護衛、内有親信二人、是晚爲苑等設計、陪其親信赴日租界娼窑宿妓、祗留副官一人、待郝寢後、自去休息、昨晨四時許、苑某即將郝自用手槍取出、並開放該宅大門、時有汽車一輛停在門外、有二人偕苑登樓、入郝寢室、時郝尙在好夢方酣、經苑等將其喚醒、見來者係二不相識之人、乃疑有變故、繼見來者各出手槍、自知不能抵抗、要求穿衣隨行、未得許可、將郝架下樓梯、裝入汽車内、經曲巷向華界開駛、以避警察耳目、於五時左右開抵第一軍團部、沿路警察、均未識破、蓋郝身祗着一褲叉、上身赤　、下身赤足、驚魂甫定、由軍部代購褲褂大衫蔽體</p>
<h3>（軍部審訉郝之供主詞）</h3>
<p>旋即開始審訊、郝對謀亂事不諱、對寳抵玉田各縣所委之張子周等兄弟三人、承認係本人委任、其他委狀發出雖多、本人不知、多係吳子良所爲、蓋軍部前已將張子周等逮捕、曾供係郝委派、故郝亦自承認、惟對此次津變、則堅决否認參加、並謂本人反對此舉、便衣隊祗二千人、何能即攻克津巿、本人前與于主席相識、知其爲人正　、對津巿擾亂、曾向日人建言不可爲、至各縣所委各軍、乃緣不滿國民黨之施政及把持云云、</p>
<h3>（報告中央依法審理）</h3>
<p>昨晨十時後、日領田中、爲此事赴軍部謁于主席値于赴巿府辦公、田劉參謀長代見、田中謂中國政府越界捕人、於日本警察及憲兵之體面難堪、前王一民長公安局時代、曾越界捕劉學古、結果由公安局道　、此事較劉案尤爲重大、請對郝暫勿處置云云、劉參謀長向于請示後、當答以我並未越界捕人、此事乃係同黨内閧、郝鵬爲中央及省府明令通緝之要犯、旣已到案、當依法審理、日領謂關於是否中國官廳越界捕人、尙須經過一度調查、于氏聞已電呈中央及北平軍委分會政整會、報告經過、因郝係中央通緝要犯、將來或解南京北平、以　審理再行處置、亦未可知、至捕郝之苑某等、亦將予以獎勵（七月七日）</p>

<h3>（主席報告）</h3>
<p>主席隴體要報告、略謂、今天是國民革命軍誓師北伐的七週紀念、在七年前的今天、北伐進行非常順利、我們回想當時有二種很可樂觀的現象、一、當時國民與革命軍極能一致、二、本黨同志意志尤能集中、國民與本黨同志、一同在本黨所揭　的目標下、共同進行、因此無論軍事政治上的糾紛、均可迎刃而解、毫無滯碍、没有一年、北伐便成功了、後來不幸共產黨從中搗亂、以好聽的名詞、來煽惑民衆、等到政府奠定基礎、共黨之勢始稍戢、我們從此得到一個好敎訓、覺得無論軍事政治到靪一種無辦法的時期中、必有强有力的黨的力量主持一切、尤其是軍事方面、領袖最爲重要、華北戰事、我方最大缺點、即是軍事指揮不統一、每到緊要關頭、諸領袖討論軍事、應会問題、等到開會後、前方軍事已有變化、所以結果慘敗、實可痛心、論者徒歸咎於器械不及他人猶知其一而不知其二、徧觀世界各國、如德意志之有希特勒、意大利之有墨索里尼、土耳其之有開末爾、蘇俄之有列寗·司丹林·皆有一最高領袖、統馭一切、而後有成、以民主號召之美國、近在不景氣之狀况下、且動議將所有政權取决於羅斯福一人、昔希臘時代、分二大階級、一統治階級、二、努隸階級、少數統治、管馭一切、無經濟權者、便不能入</p>
<p>國會活動、以歷史眼光觀之、民主政治這好聽名詞、實是壓迫階級、欺騙被壓迫階級的一種手段而已、在目前中國絕對不需要此吟風弄月的無聊理論、我們要硬幹·要服從·一眞正的領袖、我們在今天回溯已往、爲什麽北伐時易于成功、現在景象則漸趨衰靡、此等問題、皆値得吾人之討論云云、演說畢、羣呼口號而散、</p>

<h3>‖主席致詞‖</h3>
<p>開會如儀後由主席聶璐生致開會詞、略謂、今日中華棉產改進會、舉行第二屆常年大會、各省代表遠道出席、無任欣快、此一年間常委會雖時有進行計劃、對中央或各省建議、但無效果、甚以爲憾、中國棉產問題之重要遠者姑不論、民二十外棉進口、達四百餘萬担、二十一年三百餘萬担、中國在世界上稱第三位、而原棉進口若此之多、中國在積大於美國、而輸入美棉達二百餘萬担、實可驚心、如此情形、不能補救、雖無外侮、亦難生存、故吾人今日集會於此、應自省所負使命之重大與其急迫、此次會議僅兩日、議案演講需時甚多、希望共商如何共謀改進國内棉量、如何請政府與社會恊助努力進行云云、次由將迪先報告一年間會務進行及收支賬略、、</p>
<h3>（演詞一斑）</h3>
<p>報告畢、由來賓演說、㈠上海銀行鄒秉文致詞、略謂、改進棉產、固應注意改良品質與推廣產量、但對於棉花運銷、亦須研究、即如何而使改良之棉花而達於銷費之事、不經轉手、减少棉農損失、與銷費者之担負云云、㈡實業部實業顧問洛夫博士講發展中國全國棉業計劃、」由陳燕山翻譯、講詞甚長、略謂、中國對改進棉產、無整個計劃、故成效甚少、中國需棉甚多、估計每人年一元五角、每年輸入外棉達一萬餘萬金、則改改進棉產之重可知、改進中國棉產、應有整個計劃、其問題可分三點、㈠研究、㈡示範、㈢推廣、必先有研究、何地宜棉、何地宜何種棉、如何育種、而獲得良好新品種、旣得新品種、又須作示範、俾農民知其優良而樂於應用、或謂中國守舊、改良推廣爲難、實際不然、中國農民守舊、與美國相</p>
<h3>中華棉產改進會年會（徐天章攝）</h3>
<p>同、欲其不守舊、則須行示範方法、旣行示範、則行推廣、農民已對示範有相當信仰、則推廣至易、研究示範及推廣三者、總須中央有統一機關、俾與各省聯絡、分工合作、以免重複而徒費金錢、其次則培養人才、亦屬要事、訓練人才送往外國、不如聘外國專家到中國訓練、費用省而成效大、如國内訓練之人才、尙須作特殊之研究、則再選派出國可也、次由浙江建設廳長曾養甫講「浙法改良棉業之方針」略謂、浙江原係產棉省份、自供自給、少估之尙缺十數萬担、此景之不足也浙棉僅能紡十支十二支之粗紗、不能應滬上紗廠需要、此質之不善也故浙棉改良方針、質與量並求進展、近來浙省所提倡百</p>
<p>萬棉、每畝比土棉可多收四分之一、以品質較好、每担價値比土棉可多賣四分之一、　是百萬棉推廣成功、農民坐獲二分之一之利益、不可謂不鉅、若得海沙山田、全部闢爲棉田、浙棉進展、更覺可觀、所感困難者、推廣甚爲棘手耳、茲欲解决此項困難、推廣上浙省創行有效方法、㈠運用政治力量、如百萬惁在某區已證明爲適宜優良品種、所有該區棉田、以政治力量、悉數令其種植百萬棉、不准雜植他種、不僅推廣效率、因而增高、並可操縱純良種子之繁殖、而運銷合作、亦易於推行、㈡各方通力合作、設立浙省棉業改進委員會、聯合紗廠、花行金融界棉農與政府共同努力、以圖發展、㈢統制管理、改良實施區内種子、肥料排水及運銷等等均在政府指導下、統制管理之、凡此種種、於蠶種推廣、已欠大效、棉花方面、想亦不至如何失敗也、又推廣人才、正由農業推廣人員養成所培養實施工作人才、以資應用、不過整個棉業之改良推廣、斷非少數人之力所能勝任、尙望到會各界、予以切實合作、浙省農業推廣、自信略具基礎、但將來究竟成功如何、殊不敢必、爲企圖進步計、極願以浙江一省供諸位棉業改進之試騐、以爲全國之參據、幸勿吝予指敎是盼、演說畢、時已十二時、乃休息午膳、</p>
<h3>‖下午會議‖</h3>
<p>下午二時、繼續開會、葉元鼎主席、由朱仙舫講吾國紡織今後所需原料之質與量、略稱、將來吾國所需原棉之質由量、日有進步、欲期適合需要、第一期棉花纎維至一吋者須一百三十萬擔、至</p>
<p>一·二五吋者、須三百三十萬擔、至一·五吋以上者、須六十萬擔、總計六百二十萬擔、第二期原棉纎維至一吋者、須一千零十萬擔、至一、二五吋者、須四百七十萬擔、至一·五吋以上者、須一百萬擔、總計一千五百八十萬擔、世界人文日益進化、產業管理、愈臻合理化、上述所定原棉之質與量、决非過言、深望到會植棉專家、亟有以準備之也、末由金陵大學敎授徐仲迪君演講美國之棉花運銷合作、略云、美國棉農受借壓迫、及棉花品無標準、受貿易上損失、咸起組織、诸銷合作社、得政府之指示、農校这輔導、銀行之贊助、業務進步甚速、社會信用日著、有抗抵巿塲劇變之力、無操縱壟斷之弊、農民及廠家、交受其益、願吾國從事棉業者、亦起效之、整個棉業前途、定有良好影響也、</p>

<h3>會長致詞</h3>
<p>會長吳醒亞氏致開會詞云、諸位來賓、本會費兩星期之籌備時間、得綢緞業同人熱烈參加、使我們對這樣琳琅滿目機杼萬家得有鑑賞的機會、同時蒙各界來賓紛紛蒞會參加指導和竭力提倡、在這一點上已是使得本會得到初步的成功、</p>
<p>國綢歷史綢緞是我們祖先五千餘年的傳家寳、自從嫘祖敎民育蠶以後、繅絲織綢、日漸改進、在古希臘羅馬時代、中國已有大量絲綢輸出、至西歷三世紀傳入日本印度、六世紀傳入東羅馬、十二世紀以後始爲法意所倣倣、到了現在、中·日·印·意·德·法·等國、均爲絲織之邦了、</p>
<p>綢業演進織綢的方法、在最初只是經緯交織、成爲簡單之素品、後來加用針剌、才有花樣、再有提花裝置之發明、到了光緖年代、始由日本輸入新式提式花機及手拉鐵木合製機、民元以後、絲織業方逐漸由家庭工業變成公司組織、初用木製「茄克特」提花機及手拉鐵木合製機、繼用日本鐵木合製電力機、民國七年、始由上海美亞織綢廠採用新式鐵製電力機、其後各廠亦陸續採用歐美新式機器、到了這個時候、中國絲織業才開始踏上新式工業的道路了、</p>
<p>工業地位中國工業、以種類言、紡織業實估第一、以地域言、上海實佔第一位、紡織業中、除棉業居首位外、次爲繅絲業及絲織業、根據社會局以往統計、上海紡織業總資本約二萬萬元、其中華資佔五千萬元、在此五千萬元中、除棉織業外、繅絲業約佔二百五十萬元、絲織業約佔一百三十萬元、而絲織業一百三十萬元中、獨資經營者約百分之三、合夥者約佔百分之四十、公司經營者、約百分之五十七、這就是說絲織業已逐漸脫離手工業而進爲新式工業、由小規模經營而爲大規模經營、</p>
<h3>國產綢緞展覽會開幕（徐天章攝）</h3>
<p>國外贸易上面說過、在古希臘羅馬時代、中國綢緞已在大量輸出、海禁大開以後、中國在國際贸易上、絲茶實居首位、但近年以來、絲已降爲第二位、茶則屈居第七位、豆類則躍爲第一位、但豆類多在東北產、暴日現已强佔東北四省、豆類出口、已不復爲我國主要輸出品了、至綢緞之出口、一則因歐美各國人造絲之代用品壓倒天然絲、再則因越南朝鮮印度加重關稅之故、致中國國產綢緞對外銷路、受嚴重打擊、計十八年出口、綢緞價値爲二千一百餘萬兩、十九年爲一千九百餘萬兩、二十年爲二千四百餘萬兩、二十一年爲一千八百餘萬兩、如果繼續</p>
<p>下降、則國產綢緞之國外銷路、將不知伊於胡底、</p>
<p>絲業影響我國天然絲產品、每年約爲二十五萬石、計銷國外者、约爲十三萬石、銷於國内者、約爲十二萬石、年來因繭品减收、絲價高昻之故、本國綢廠、多歡迎兼用人造絲相交織、因之人造絲進口、年有增加、計十三年爲二百三十餘萬兩、十四年爲二百六十餘萬兩、十五年爲四百八十餘萬兩、十六年爲五百三十餘萬兩、十七年以後、續有增加、我國當局雖對人造絲曾一度加重關稅、但廠方仍以採用人造絲、較爲合算、在主張採用人造絲的理由、以爲自科學昌明後、人工每巧奪天工、人造絲旣可利用棉織絲與木纎維做原料、成本較天然綢低得多、且具有光澤强、本質滑和、甚少沾染塵埃諸特點、雖中產以下的人民、亦有能力購置、如果政府旣不提倡製造人造絲、又重征人造絲進口稅、徒予中下消費者以不利、殊不知人造絲觸手粗糙、反撥性少、耐水力弱、我們决不能爲外商傾銷政策所愚、以爲舶來品價廉物美、致將本國國產一筆抺殺、我們固然承認國產綢緞或較人造絲織品稍貴、但最是因爲成本的關係、如果全國上下一致努力、使絲繭成本减低、綢緞價値、自隨之而减低、近來國人每嗜舶來品之新奇、不惜重價購買外貨、觀於外國呢絨進口之遞增、可以槪見、而於本國固有之良好綢緞、則反視若無覩、　　剷除障碍㈠團結同業力量、作技術上之改進、綢緞業在過去數千年來、每爲固步自封、毫無聯絡、須知同行業彼此合作、互相觀摩、最爲必要、這種團結、并不是自成帮口壟斷一切、形成類似歐洲中世紀基爾特的組織、或行會制度、此</p>
<p>種基爾特或行會制度、在最初固然也曾彼此監視、但到後來、某種工業爲某種基爾特或行會所操縱、致本身不求長進、因爲品貨惡劣、技術陳腐、結果爲新興工業所推倒、本巿綢緞業在從前帮别甚多、各立門戶、例如公所會館名爲同業組織、實則專事收解捐稅而已、民十六年、曾行商民恊會綢緞業分業之組織、然内部甚形渙散、十八年始正式成立上海巿綢緞業同業公會、從此綢緞業乃有統一組織之可言、㈡金融機關與出產機關之合作、過去我们感覺有一矛盾現象、即一方面產業界資本十分枯窘、無法挹注、一方面金融機關現金充斥、無法權出、生產機關與金融機關失調、在在可以看出、本來銀行爲發展實業之先鋒隊、若無銀行爲之輔助、欲圖實業發展、中西無此先例、現在綢緞有綢業銀行之設立、今後互相策應之處、當必甚多、其造福綢緞當不可限量、㈢减低捐稅、外貨進口、只須繳納進口稅、即可暢行無阻、本國貨品、銷行内地、則有累次的重征、這爲國產品有莫大的阻礙、今後如欲與外貨競爭、非减低捐稅不可、㈣减低成本綢緞原料爲天然絲、如將來蠶種改良繅絲進步、當可减少成本不少、同時綢廠不斷採用最進步技術、自亦可减去一部份成本、㈤與外國訂立互惠稅約、近年來絲織品國外銷路之阻滯、多由外國關稅壁壘之故、例如朝鮮越南印度等處、向爲我國綢緞行銷地、因爲稅率加高的原故、致綢緞商却步不前、故爲推廣銷路計、應與各銷行國家訂立互惠條約、㈥力闢本國消費者崇尙外貨心</p>
<p>理、中國爲世界最大巿塲、可是國人迷信洋貨心理、比除奸團的幾十磅重的烽彈暴發性還要强、故欲剷除國產品的障礙、須先剷除迷信洋貨的心理、培養愛中國貨的習慣、最後我要敬告各位來會參觀的諸君、是快耳悅目、同樣是人類的習慣、記得從前、有一位皇后、呌做妲己、好呌裂繪的聲音、後來人家說紂王因而亡國、現在本會陳列許多錦繡羅綺、給諸位來賓鑑别、我希望諸位不要僅僅爲得來看看、如果僅僅爲得好看、將來恐與妲己專爲呌的緣故、因而同樣遭受亡國的慘途完了、</p>
<p>兪鴻鈞吳巿長代表俞秘書長鴻鈞演說略謂、中國絲綢業、現在已發生極重大危機、如不急圖挽救、則不　該業本身受其害、而整個的國民經濟、亦將受其影響、空言提倡國產、空言補塞漏巵、斷無濟於　、亟應從實際方面、於產銷各方、謀澈底的救濟、金融界與絲綢業、應從速擬定及實施一有效的切實合作方案、政府在不平等條約束縛之下、雖不能採取保護關稅之政策、以解除洋貨傾銷之危害、但深信各主管機關、對於現在絲綢業之難關、必竭力恊助、以逐漸求光明之出路也、在民衆一方面、如明暸國民經濟破產危在眉睫、急起直追、抱堅忍犧牲之精神、採科學之方法、研究社會之需要、人民之心理、以從事於國產絲綢業之提倡、則亡羊補牢、未爲晚也云云、</p>

<p>問題、不是我們解决得了的、我們祇要在做衣服</p>
<p>的時候、留一留神、把外國貨換上了中國的綢緞、這個問題、至少要解决一半了、諸位、你們在滬杭旅行的時候、不是見沿路綫一片一片的桑田、很靑翠可愛的嗎、江浙一帶、農家的生命、一半是　蠶桑的、蠶養得好、一個農家、每年多了一二百元的收入、卽作爲種田的資本、卽使本年田稻收成差一些、也可以安穩過去了、但是近幾年來、爲了繭子買不起錢、養蠶賠本的緣故、所以多把桑田毀棄了、種田資本缺了、以　農民的生產、一年少一年、呌他們怎樣過活呢、繭子爲什麽買不起錢、就是因爲廠絲、在外國的銷路、銷不出去、絲廠停頓起來、就釀成這個現象了、中國的絲、爲什麽要專靠外國的銷路銷不出去、</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>就把蠶桑事業、幾乎倒塌下來、這一點就可以反證國產的綢緞銷路不達、自己的原料、自己不能利用了、俗語說得好、吃是受用、着是威風、大家喜用外國貨的緣故、不過裝漂亮、表示體面罷了、我們開國產綢緞展覽會的緣故、就是要把很好的國產出品、盡量介紹給大衆、使一般仕女們、曉得我們也有頂好頂新的出品、不必再仰求什麽來路貨了、還有一般經濟的人們、平常喜歡穿什麽呢呀、嗶嘰呀、不過貪圖價目公道一點、質料經久一點罷了、我們　要趁這個時機、介紹給諸位、我們國產綢緞裏面、也有很多耐穿價廉的東西呢、敝人今天這一番的話、不是單單站在商人方塲、替什麽商人鼓吹生意、亦不是轉換一個方向、替農民呼籲、實在是站在國民的立塲、覺得農村的滅落、就是整個中國的没落、要挽救這個危機、就要先把蠶桑事業、恢復過來、發達起來、這個關鍵、就在大衆身上做衣服的時候、留神一下就是了、我末了再向諸位作一誠懇的請求諸位、大家起來救濟農村、應先來救濟蠶桑、尤應儘力提倡國產綢緞、以解决衣的問題、可聯帶解决食的問題、就是整個的民生問題、亦不難解决了、</p>

<p>敎育部之態度今日（八日）由京來平之敎育界黃英談稱、敎部對平大學潮、决先以和平態度、使靑年學生覺悟、如學生堅持主張、敎部必貫澈整頓學風之政策、防止學生作軌外行動、北平學聯會將聯合各校學生晉京請願、敎部對此頗爲注意、平大藝術學院改專、高中停辦、勢在必行、無法挽回、如學生赴京、决無效果、不論學生在平或晉京、苟無軌外行動則已、如有軌外行動、則必嚴厲制裁、如某學院學生閙風潮、則解散某學院、解散後、另組整理委員會、敎職員分别重聘、學生另行甄别試騐、此係敎部預定之辦法、平大高中在北平中海運料門内、接</p>

<p>春秋中華國產絲綢专號</p>
<h3>提倡國貨綢緞的橫面</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>寫這篇宣傳文字的時候，覺得自已太可憐了。在目下國際資本主義商業的激戰中，只有我們這東方古老的國度偏會喊出「提倡國貨」的口號，而且在擴大地運動着。因爲人民貪用外國貨品；或國貨不能代替而用外國貨品；這時代生產的落伍，已是多麽可恥！但更甚於此的，確還有在中國軍隊和日本死拚的戰爭時期裏，各地通商巿上竟發現了私運私販的奸商！</p>
<p>提倡國貨的意議，由我看來，實在是可憐的。我們爲什麽不高呌「抵制外貨」呢？</p>
<p>在這裏，大家明白，中國人民是永遠保守着懶惰，貪小便宜，得過且過的特性。進步一些，也只會摹倣冒牌，用各種技術欺驅，達到自我的利益。所以除了在上海廣州等商埠，居然瞧到工廠的烟囱外，内地是依然度着十八世紀前的手工業的生活。猴子腦的商人，便趁機販賣洋貨，從都會推銷到農村，恰奸中國人的民族性因貪懶而同時具有的「時髦觀念」，昻起頭來，便年年把農村裏的錢財，借商人的手，轉入都巿，再轉入外國去。在我們鄉間，簡直没有一家就没有日本貨的玩具，磁器，花標衣衫和盛先生牌的纸烟。連農人茶館裏不識字的老兒，也揑着「撲克」玩！</p>
<p>因了依賴惡習的薰陶，把人類的創造性都湮没起來，可是又不能不生活，於是使用外國貨的「鶩外性」立刻像傳染病似的散佈了全中國。</p>
<p>一方面，以人民納稅爲當然義務的政府，因了内在的陰影，似科並未顧到保護商業，維擊農工國家的基礎；對於關稅壁壘，從没有隨時增高或拒絕進口的權衡，使廉價的國貨，給更廉價的外國貨奪掉了銷路，像最近向美國的棉麥借欵是。你一定會知道：國麥每擔僅値洋二元二三角，美麥須値五元四角；那一種貴？那一種賤？</p>
<p>爲了這緣故，唯利是圖的商人，便聯絡了權貴的富力，向國外去承購本來無法銷售的過剩貨物。因是，抵制日貨的聲浪中，也有大批仇貨駁進中國海岸，向大棧房裏貯！</p>
<p>在這種情勢之下，請問「抵制外貨」是可能的事嗎？好像外被不平等條約所拘縛，内又連年天災兵亂的中國，對一切都絕望了！對一切都毀滅了！何僅國貨？</p>
<p>所以我說：提倡國貨，其實是可憐的。那一個國家在高喊「提倡國貨」呢？「提倡國貨」是光榮的運動嗎？倘國貨工廠不求精造而僅靠「提倡國貨」來賺錢，以飽滿小有產階級的私囊，應該原諒的嗎？更有腐化的投機商人以洋貨冒充國貨，尤其是綢緞，不應該設法調查嗎？</p>
<p>最後，允許我問：「提倡國貨」，難道單是商人們的事嗎？</p>

<h3>去年人造絲　今年人要死</h3>
<p>— 卓呆</p>
<p>有一天，我到友人王君家裏，見有</p>
<p>了一個面生的女子了。年約十八九歲，身上穿一件爛如桑皮纸的綢衣。我一打聽，方知是他家新添的婢女，呌做秀英</p>
<p>我便與秀英搭赸，曉得她是湖放某鎭的鄕下人，今年二十一歲，是種田的。家有一母一兄。現在因爲生計艱，所以至上海來充婢女。</p>
<p>「爲什麽鄕下會弄到這樣呢？」我問她「夋養蠶的，往年養了四址天蠶，可以吃用一年，種田不過是自弄些飯米罷了；不料去年繭子一些賣不掉，欠了桑葉的錢，我母親没有法子，還只得把三畝半飯米田也押給人家了。」</p>
<p>我聽了她的話，點點，對她混身上下打量了一番，覺得她這件衣服，穿得不倫不類。</p>
<p>「你身上的衣服，是這裏少奶奶給你的麽？」</p>
<p>「你們種田人家，爲什麽不穿布衣？」</p>
<p>我不解。</p>
<p>「先生！」她似乎有些笑我不懂事的神氣：「這是人造絲的，價錢便宜得很，我在前年做的。我們前村後村的姑娘們，誰都買了人造絲衣料來做的。」</p>
<p>我聽到這裏，心中非常不快了：</p>
<p>「如此說來，你上一年做了這件人造絲的衣服，下一年就飯也没有吃了？」</p>
<p>她很怪訝的對我看着，似乎穿衣與吃飯，完全是兩件事。</p>
<p>「你們養蠶的人，都穿了人造絲，無怪繭子没有人要了！」我說。</p>
<p>她好像覺得我的話不通：</p>
<p>「不是的！人造絲的衣料，是綢緞店裏賣的，繭是客人來收去的。</p>
<p>我不理她，自言自語的說：</p>
<p>「去年人造絲，今年人要死！」</p>
<h3>綢展開篇</h3>
<p>— 小逸</p>
<p>今歲人稱國貨年，綾羅綢緞鬥鮮妍，匹夫應負興亡責，把提倡宣傳做一担肩。新式樣，賽雲烟，花花綠萬萬千，一朝薈萃到春申浦，殿覽宏開色色全。巿商會陳列共三天，有幾位名闻東土千金女，有幾位家擁南山二頃田；有幾位革命靑年心切切；有幾位多才學士腹便便。一聽得如斯盛會稱難再，結伴來遊手互牽，自然會頂刮刮三字讚空前。若然人人買一疋回家去，弱女嬌妻喜欲穎；若然人人做一套西裝着，歐美呢絨就不値錢。要知道能挽利權防外溢，早免却歷年啞叭吃黃連，又何至白生生滾出那如許大花邊。</p>

<p>手兩個指頭，掄搓着纸煤，眼睛望了紙煤頭上的烟，慢呑呑的答道：這個年月，那是維新得多了，婚姻大事，總不能全憑父母作主，我還有什麽不明白的，所以有人提到孩子的親事，我總不敢一口答應。其實趙家這門親，那自然是很好的。說着，他又呼嚕呼嚕抽起水烟來。黃太太微笑道：這樣說，您倒是願意了，大姑娘怎麽着；你讓我们喝這碗冬瓜湯嗎？桂枝看了壁上的美人畫，只是望着，不肯回過頭來。黃太太道：這話我就實說了，趙家是實心實意的，要攀這一門子親，趙老术爺，倒是親自來找着我們先生，託着圓成這件事。我們本來想到府上去說合，無奈你二家住在一塊兒，我們這話，也有些不好說，所以請您娘兒倆到城裏來玩玩，順便的，就和您娘兒倆談談這件事。您要是覺得可以談談，咱們就談下去。要不，那也没什麽關係，好在是在我這裹說話，誰也不會聽到，我們這個作媒的，和平常作媒的不同，全用不着撒謊，趙家的事，您比我們還淸楚啦。江氏道：黃太太，您好說。撒謊，您圖什麽來着。我不是說了嗎，我是没有什麽話說。黃太太道，大姑娘，這身終是大事，你說呀，咱們全是女人，說了有什麽要緊。黃曼英走上前，拖着桂枝一隻手道：您老瞧那張畫作什麽（一二五）</p>

<h3>人靠衣裝</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>「人靠衣裝」是老話，是没有時間性的，自從「本葉旣脫乃服衣裳」以後，這老話就成立了。緣我們蘇州人比較的在衣字上最肯用些功夫，儘管食住行感到困難，那衣却不能馬虎的，管食住生了兩句謡諺，呌做「身上穿着綢，家裏煨着火石榴。」火石榴就是行灶，意思是譏笑那些人們，衣裝都很考究，家庭經濟完全不問，換一句話說「餓死事小，體面事大。」這種蘇州的人生哲學，直接間接造成之「蘇緞」的地位，並且「繅絲」「織機」，成了蘇州最大的手工業，甚至兒時的玩物，塑成「掉絲娘」的，有把絲線放紙鷂宾，凡此種種，都是以證明蘇州以前綢緞業的發皇。</p>
<p>可是現在大不其然了！蘇州城東的機匠住宅區，枯寂得毫無生氣。「經賬房」「綢緞莊」苟延殘喘，眼看着巴黎紐約東京甚至印度，都把花花綠綠的綢緞呢絨，輸送過來，一件件披到蘇州人的身人，雖然保持着蘇州的人生哲學的精神，可是繅絲織機兩大手工業，大受打擊了　　大家喜歡外國貨，我來講一椿外國故事，我的朋友未髴，給珊瑚半月刋寫了一段話：</p>
<p>記得在美國的時候，有一位德國的同學，嚷着没有香烟抽，我們告訴他，隨處可得，他正色回答道；「但是都不是德國貨！」後來我在法國，遇到一位英國敎授，他請我伴他去買皮鞋，走過不少很好的鞋舖，他鴢是掉頭不顧，後來到了一家小店，却欣然的進去，買了一雙當時我也隨着進去，便發見這一家鞋舖，　是蘇蘭人開的。等到他們成交以後，我笑問這位敎授道：道「抵制我國貨麽？」他笑道：「否！否！買英國貨是我們的習慣而已。」　　這椿故事，讀者看了，有何感想？說得憤懣些，中國人買外國貨，也幾乎成了習慣了。</p>
<p>我眞不懂，中國人的心裏，怎麽轉變得如此的快，「洋鬼子」的觀念，跇離現在不到四十年，（從庚子算起）一切都轉變成「望洋興羡」講到國貨綢緞，在近幾年來，已經非常改進，無論光采，色調，國畫，實在比外國貨有過無不及，爲什麽人們還是要去買未必好過國貨的外國綢緞呢？並且講到價値也是國貨便宜，在農村經濟崩潰已經泛濫到中產階級的今日，尤其應當顧到一些購買力，難道當眞成了「身上穿着外國綢，家裏煨着火石榴」麽！？</p>
<p>就我們人的經騐而言，衣裝用國貨綢緞，實在合算，這兩年來，綢價和布價差不多了，外國布有的還比國貨貴些呢。夏衣更爲相宜，我不懂有許多朋友，在大熱天還穿着白嗶嘰，或是法蘭絨西裝，熱得透不過氣來，比他們的伴侶，飄飄欲仙的一襲單綢夏衣，苦樂如保　　所以我說：「人靠衣裝」是不錯的，但應得加上一句「國貨風光」！</p>

<p>照表中看來，那些人物的不同，和組織的複雜，自然可以知道政令的難以適合。並且各種團體有某官署應管而未管的，也有不應管而偏要管的，也有欲管而不得的，也有團體較官署成立較早的，（這一層其實最易解决，只要法制一定，就有辦法，例如上海巿上，嚴筱舫擬組商會的時候，淸廷還没有農工商部，後來商會有了成法，究竟一切都不成問題了。」也有因官署的取締法令，而產生一種自衛性的團體的。再則官署自己變化多端，有不及行使一種政權，而本身已經改組或消滅的。丨旣造成目下駢枝錯節的機關，流寇割據的團體，終至愈難收拾。若能及早政府一面確定權限，「中國醫藥行政」，應集權交與什麽官署辦理，一方面正名定分。訂立法制，那些醫藥界人物，該如何組織？暫時如何行使他們業務？將來如何改進到世界大同的醫藥上去。或者還可以補救。倘使照近來這樣，視衛生署爲前淸總理衙門，視署員爲二毛子，（拳匪排外語）。另外要呌什麽國醫館的大阿哥，來訂新條例，那是中國醫藥，簡直永不能上軌道了。另外有人說，「小小醫藥界的混亂。算什麽，不過是政治一部份的縮影而已。」我倒覺得這位先生言重了。如今我且將近年衛生署那些嘗試的政令叙一叙，看事實是怎樣。</p>
<h3>擇醫常識</h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>醫藥事業，爲民族健全之要素，民族之發達與否，與醫藥有密切之關係，世界各國，醫藥事業發達者，民族亦健全，而國力亦蒸蒸日上。扶桑三島，自明治維新以還，以改良醫藥爲維新政策之一，政府倡於上，人民趨於下，至今日醫藥之發達，與國步之隆盛，並駕齊驅，可以證矣。返觀我國，内政不修，國難日亟，益以天災人禍，民不聊生，逃死不暇，遑言醫藥，此申報於國事蜩螗之今日，能注意與民族健全息息相關之醫藥問題，發揮探討，不遺餘力，其於報章天職無忝，洵難能可貴也。</p>
<p>疾病者，生活狀態玆變化也，欲使此種變化，歸於常態，則不能不有賴乎藥物等療法，易言之，疾病之結果如何，胥視所施療法之適當與否以爲斷。而主持此種療法者，則爲責重任巨之醫生，是醫生者，實操人類之生死權，吾人不幸而患病，則於醫生之選擇，能勿特加注意耶？用將擇醫之常識數則，介紹於讀者，俾抱采薪之憂者，略知問津焉。</p>
<p>㈠二十世紀爲科學之世界，凡百事業，皆以科學爲依歸，合於科學者勝利，否則必敗，此爲世人所公認，醫爲科學之一分科，且爲根據科學研究治療之學問，故吾人擇醫，可不問其爲中爲西，爲新爲舊，能基於科學者歡迎之，如其不然，應避之若浼，或鳴鼓而攻之。現代之新醫，其治療之方法，實爲根據科學研究之結晶，能合於前述之定義者也，　病者執捨執從，當可暸然。</p>
<p>㈡世風澆薄，人心不古，醫本爲高尙之職業，乃以二三害羣之馬，不顧　義，日以虛僞誇大之廣告，載諸報端，以冀引人入彀，以醫學發達之今日，有數種疾病，尙無確效之療法，而彼輩偏謂立時見效，限日告痊，致令無識愚民，受其欺惑，貽禍社會，莫此爲甚，故吾人幸勿爲其所愚。</p>
<p>㈢一般自稱爲國醫者，其間雖不乏優秀分子，而藉祖傳之名，爲招徠病人之術者，頗有其人，無識之流，以爲苟非良醫，焉能一傳再傳，詎知彼輩所謂祖傳者，乃祖非天縱之聖，其於治潦疾病，豈能盡操左券耶？况醫藥事業之進步，與時代相推移，昔之目爲妙術秘方，豈可陳陳相因，永久而不變哉，迷信祖傳之病家，其亦以吾言爲然否？</p>
<p>㈣醫與藥雖有相互之關係，然其爲業則二也，吾國醫藥，素無顯著之界限，且以醫生，不爲世所重視，故出身龐雜，不論何人，能讀幾句湯頭歌者，便有行醫之資格，因之，業藥者爲招徠營業計，竟越爼代疱，爲人診病，人以其便易，亦甚歡迎，幸而藉自然之力，所患告痊，則彼即貪天之功，居然自稱名醫矣。究其實，醫藥各有專長，不能混淆，且以無醫學知識之業藥者，代行醫生職務，其危險實甚，世有不欲以生命作孤注之擲者，幸勿延此畸形變相之醫生。</p>
<p>㈤病而求醫，已爲人類一種常識，惜我國民智太低，對於醫藥無正確之認識，患病者常不求治於醫生，而乞靈於無知之木偶，以符籙仙方，而悞寳貴生命者，比比皆是，不圖神權時代之遺毒，迄今猶盛行於域内，良堪浩歎，望社會智識階級者，速起而倡除之可也。</p>
<p>㈥病者有幸，能延一學騐兼優之醫師，即須加以絕對之信仰，俾得循序施治，早秦膚功，疾病本有一定之經過·一藥而愈者鮮矣。如日易數醫，藥石雜投，人體係有限量之生物，非金剛不壞，豈可爲藥石之試騐塲所，往往不因病而殆，因藥而殆，比比然也，吾儕能勿注意及之。</p>
<p>㈦醫學爲現代科學之結晶，故無科學智識者，不可以爲醫，且醫學之範圍甚廣，吾人窮畢生之力，幸獲有成，然亦不能博通各科，是以長於内科者，未必精於外科，長於產科者，未必精於牙科，要在患者擇其所長而就治，必能早占勿藥也。</p>
<p>㈧外人來華，以醫藥爲宣傳宗敎之工具，歷時較久，頗得人民之信仰，淺見之流，每染疾病，競乞外人診治，至死不悔，此蓋我國科學落伍，崇外思想過度使然，究其實在，外醫非皆學騐兩富之輩，况語言不通。診病之障碍甚多，影響於治療者甚大。近今我國新醫，已有長足之進步，足以並駕外醫，亟望患病者，速求治於新醫，方信鄙言非過譽也。</p>
<p>要之，臨病求醫，已嫌其晚，最好莫如預防於未病，是則衛生之道尙焉，内經云，飲食有常，起居有節，不妄作勞，故能與神俱，而盡終其天年，此衛生之要旨也，幸吾人三復斯言。</p>
<h3>寸口診脈的討論㈣</h3>
<p>— 佘雲岫</p>
<p>㈨心肝腎肺脾命門的次序</p>
<p>，上從五行相生的玄論生出來的。</p>
<p>貴國醫認識脈的跳動，是臓腑的氣已經是錯了，那末他們三個指頭，按在病人寸口地方，當然是測候藏府之氣，在左手寸關尺的，當然是心肝腎的藏氣</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，在右手寸關尺的，當然是脾肺命門的藏氣，寸口動脈的跳動，當然就是心肝腎三個廢氣和脾肺命門三個藏氣分道左右，一齊來到寸口地方的表現，表是何以三個藏氣，魚貫相聯，來到寸口地方呢，何以右尺是命門的藏氣，右關是脾的藏氣，右寸是肺的藏氣，左寸左關左尺是腎肝心的藏氣呢，古來却没有人解釋過，只有儲泳引尊生經說道，「左手之寸極上，右手之尺極下，男子陽順，自下生上，故極下之地右手之尺，爲受命之根本，如大地未分，元氣混沌也，旣受命矣，萬物從土而出，惟脾爲先，故右手尺上之關爲脾，脾土生金，故關上之寸爲肺，肺金生水，故右手之寸，越左手之尺爲腎，腎水生木，故左手尺上之關爲肝，肝木生火，故關上之雨爲心·」從古至今，對於心肝腎肺脾命門的次序，只有這一種說明，後來的人，都是照他的解釋，更没有第二種道理，來說明六脈次序的關係，所以不能不把他的說明，認做六脈次序惟一的理由了。但諸君請想一想，五行生尅的話，到</p>
<p>了現在科學時代，還能夠存在麽，還能夠應用麽，還有價値麽，還能夠在這個當中認識眞理麽，而且左腎右命門的話，還是千古聚訟的問題，彼是此非，甲論乙駁，至今還没有定論，如何可以做根據呢，况乎「右手之寸，越左手之尺，」的話，如何右手可以越到左手，右寸可以超越到左尺，有什麽理由可講呢，所以尊生經所說的話，當然是没有確實的根據，不過簸弄陰陽五行的玄論就是了。</p>
<p>㈩尺寸的長短，和藏氣進行的長短，數字不能相合。</p>
<p>退一步講，把他們寸關尺的話，和脈的進行是氣的話，不去較量是非眞妄。假定他是有事實，那末寸關尺的地盤有多少呢？把這一寸九分的地盤，三個藏氣佔領分畫起來，就是三六一十八，三三得九，各個得到六分三厘三，所以寸口脈一跳動，就是這個六分三厘三的三個藏氣，前後銜接到寸口，方才能夠完全和一寸九分的地盤相符合。而且寸口脈第二回跳動的時候，恰巧也是六分三厘三的三個藏氣，來到這一寸九分的地盤上接防，方才可以分毫不差，永遠不生錯誤。換一句說：就是寸口脈一回跳動向前進行的距離，一定也要一寸九分，方才那六分三厘三的各個藏氣，可以接得自己的防地，若是差了一分一毫，那他們的防地，就要因新舊交代的時候，發生變遷了。再換一句說：就是寸口脈第一次跳動時候，左寸的六分三厘三地盤，是心脈藏氣來佔領的，若是心脈藏氣的長短，不是恰巧六分三厘三，那第二次跳動的時候，左寸的地盤，就不是完全心脈藏氣了這是很容易明白的計算，不必另請高明的會計師，也可以算得出來。我現在要曉得古人所說寸口脈跳動一回的進行距離，究竟是有多少長短呢？靈樞不是明明說道：「脈再動，氣行三寸」麽？據此，就可以知道脈一動，氣只得行了一寸五分，和一寸九分的相差，却有四分之多，把這個相差率計算起來，那就不對了。譬如寸口脈第一動的時候，左手三部的脈，說是被肺脾命門三個藏氣佔領了。可是到了第二動，新來接防的心氣先鋒，只得行一寸五分，和他自已寸部起始點，相距尙有四分之多，這四分地盤呢，却還是老駐防軍的後隊，就是腎氣的部隊，還有四分未盡出境，還留在寸部地方。就是第二回跳動的時候，寸部六分三厘三的地方，有四分尙被舊的腎氣佔領，只有二分三厘三是心氣，關部六分三厘三地方，有四分被新來的未盡接收自己防地的心氣佔領，只有二分三厘三是肝氣，尺部六分三厘三地方，有四分被新來的未盡接收自己防地的肝氣佔領，只有二分三厘是腎氣，其餘四分腎氣，却還在境外，未曾得進自已防地。照這樣說起來，第二回跳動時候的寸關尺内容，就</p>
<p>複雜起來，不是純粹的心肝腎了。到了寸口動脈第三回跳動，那就更形複雜了。簡直弄到寸部完全不是心氣，關部完全不是肝氣，尺部完全不是腎氣，都是被雜色軍隊佔領，到了這個時候，還有什麽三部分候藏氣之可能。這件事，不必請國人受過中等敎育以上的人來解决，就請幾個略懂點之乎者也，略會讀讀我國舊醫書的貴國醫們，來澈底計算一</p>
<p>下，請問我的話對不對呢。（未完）</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>㈩腸熱症（傷寒症）（下）</p>
<p>問　腸熱症病人的全身各部症狀，可以分别講述嗎？</p>
<p>答　可以。除了發熱的狀况像上面所述之外，我們可以把消化器，脾臟，呼吸氣，神經系，循環器，皮膚等症狀分别說明。</p>
<p>問　消化器的症狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　消化器的症狀，在口内最顯明的是舌，舌在起初的時候，乾燥　裂，被有汚穢的舌苔；後來，從舌尖向内方剥離，所以舌尖淸凈，成三角形（舌三角形）。</p>
<p>問　口内還有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>答　還有發生潰瘍性口内炎，鵝口瘡，腮腺炎，等。</p>
<p>問腸熱症病人的肝臟，有没有變化？</p>
<p>答　肝臓往往肥大，因而有發黃疸的。</p>
<p>問腸熱症病人的腸内，起怎樣變化？</p>
<p>答　大都便秘，有時每天排泄二三回的豌豆狀泄瀉。腹内鼓腸，在大腸内更利害些。其最重要的，就是腸出血和腸穿孔。</p>
<p>問腸出血是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>答　是因爲腸内潰瘍面的痂皮脫落的緣故。普通直於第三星期，有時出血很多量，達一公升以上。那時候病人的體溫，急遽降下和貧血症狀，陷於顔面蒼白，四肢冷却，脈搏頻數微弱，於是虛脫。</p>
<p>問　腸穿孔，是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>答　腸穿孔，是因爲腸内病變的部分，潰瘍深蝕，腸管破裂而起。大多來於第三四星期，有急劇的腹痛，因腸内氣體竄入腹腔内，所以腹部特别膨滿，肝臟濁音部消失屢發嘔吐，吃逆脈搏細小頻數，呼吸淺表，體溫下降，數小時到數天而死。</p>
<p>問　腹腺和腹膜起什麽變化？</p>
<p>答　腸間膜腺和後腹膜腺陷於腫脹壞死，有起泛發性腹膜炎的。</p>
<p>問　脾臟的變化怎麽樣？</p>
<p>答　脾腫大，從發病後第一星期的末期</p>
<p>現出的；到第二星期，達極度，能在左肋弓下觸知他。這種脾臟腫大，常和病勢一致，若腫到高度，往往發生劇痛。這是因爲脾膜緊張之故。若起腸出血，却驟然縮小。</p>
<p>問腸熱病人呼吸器内，有没有變化？</p>
<p>答　有的。在初期有見劇烈的衂血。最特有的，是第一二星期後發生的支氣管炎，常波及深部，成爲支氣管肺炎。此外有發生下埀性肺炎，嚥下性肺炎，肺膿瘍，肺壞死，氣胸，肺梗塞等。也有腸熱症桿菌早就侵及喉頭和肺或助膜，先發生這許多部的病變。</p>
<h3>科學的達生篇（二十四）</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（十九）產褥中的攝生</p>
<p>（丁）六個星期的節慾</p>
<p>產褥期内夫婦應該同居不同房，同房不同床；如是，方可防止不節制的弊病。因爲在此時期，產婦的子宮還未充分復原，假使夫婦不節慾，那就容易發生局部的損傷，或起出血及產褥熱的原因，這六個星期的節慾，乃是最少限度，夫婦應當絕對的信守。</p>
<p>（戊）乳房的保護</p>
<p>產褥期内，如無特殊情形，比較的</p>
<p>自己哺乳，來得相宜。因爲母乳對於嬰</p>
<p>兒的營養，最爲佳良，并且自己哺乳；有益於產褥的復舊機能。</p>
<p>產後二十四小時以迄三十六小時；乳房充盈，開始授乳，授乳之前，須把乳頭，先用百分三的硼酸水洗滌，或用酒精摩擦，再用淸水拭淨，假使乳頭陷凹或扁平，恐不適於哺乳之用，可在每日用吸乳器加以吸引，乳頭上表皮，甚爲軟弱，每因授乳或被乳汁分泌等剌戟，以致上表皮剥離，如經不潔手指的汚染，那就病菌由此侵入，以致誘起乳腺炎。此種情形，是在意中，如已破裂，應速用硼酸水洗滌，再用硼酸軟膏，塗敷包紥，以防腐蝕。並在哺乳時，用橡皮製或玻璃製的乳罩，罩在乳部，可以防止乳兒口唇的接觸。自己不哺乳，或是自己哺乳而乳腺公泌旺盛，常在產後三五日間，因乳房過度緊張，疼痛難堪，那時若用吸乳器吸引排洩，但只有暫解一時痛苦的功能，嗣後仍須重複停積，而漲痛更甚，所以最好勿用此法。根本解决，應在產後第二日，就用繃帶壓迫，或施溫　法，表皮貼以棉紗，促其吸收，並宜限制飲料，投以利便藥劑，俗用麥芽煑服，就是利尿的意思。或用我國舊藥上的皮硝包紥，大約三四天後，腫脹可退。</p>
<p>（二十）初生兒的保護</p>
<p>（甲）初生兒的狀態</p>
<p>初生兒身體的表皮，都有胎脂，產後三四日，表皮形如糠狀，再經一二日，完全剥離，初生兒不問性别，生後三四日。乳腺每起腫脹，就有乳汁洩出，與母體的初乳相似，稱爲魔乳，一星期後，日漸消滅。</p>
<p>初生兒生後第二日，開始排尿，第四日後，逐漸增多。又在生後不久，就有胎糞的排泄，四五日後，方才排盡。胎糞有綠黑色有黃褐色，並含粘稠性。　　初生兒的體重，雖可平均算爲三千克，但因人種性别及發育狀况，不無增减餘地，生後四日，體重往往减少，由於大小便的排泄，營養物的少攝而來。　　初生兒十有八九，往往在生後，二三日之間，並無何種障害，而皮膚變現黃色，普通在一星期後，自然消退，這就是所謂初生兒的黃疽，由於生理的作用而起，並無餘害，所以不必特别治療，只須注意大便而已。</p>
<p>（乙）五官的機能</p>
<p>初生兒的視覺，在生後一星期中，僅有明暗的辦别。一月以後，尙無辦别五色的能力，至於認知顔色的步驟，先識黃赤，漸解白色，一年以後，方知藍綠之别。初生兒並無聽覺，及至生後第一星期終了，才知聲音，所以此時，不可高聲相驚。</p>
<p>初生兒的五官機能，當推觸覺嗅覺味覺，發生最早，妊婦胎動時，就可證明初生兒的觸覺，早在子宮生活時，業已完成。及至生後，所有口唇睫毛足蹠等部的感覺，尤爲敏捷，至於嗅覺，在分娩時亦已成就，或云，識别母體，全恃嗅覺，對於甜酸苦鹹的味覺，亦在分娩時，早經備具。</p>
<p>（丙）皮膚的淸潔</p>
<p>皮膚的淸潔，和嬰兒的健康及發育，很有關係，所以沐浴一事，實屬要點，又如臀部生殖器受有濕潤，甚易擦傷，衣服襁褓，如有尿屎汚染，應速洗滌更換，並在濕潤的局部處，用亞鉛華澱粉等撤洒，以期乾燥，若已潰瀾，可塗</p>
<p>凡士林等軟膏。</p>
<p>（丁）臍帶的斷痕</p>
<p>產後五六日，臍帶殘部脫落，二星期後，就結瘢痕，成爲臍窩。如果臍帶處置失當，就有化膿壞疽之患，臍繃帶在每次沐浴時，必須更換，若有化膿壞</p>
<p>疽的預兆，就用百分五的過酸化水素輕拭，再用没食子酸蒼鉛撤洒，臍帶脫落後，在肉芽面，仍須注意消毒，因皮膚未堅，往往易染破傷風。</p>
<h3>「癱癆鼓膈」新釋㈣</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>㈢膈氣　平常人所說的膈氣，大槪是指食物嚥下障礙，患者多以饑餓致陷於不治。這種症象是永久性的，像胃部諸症有時發生嚥下困難，嘔吐，過幾天而恢復，（所謂一時性的）當然合不上此種條件的。此中最符合的，那當然以食管癌胃癌二症最顯著了！此外像胃潰瘍症，積久易發生胃癌合併症，所以症象有時也差不多。食管擴張和狹窄，痙彎和麻痺，諸症也很類似的。（前面所述的急性向上麻痺有時也發生嚥下困難，和此種情形很類似的。但這不過是此症全部症象之一，爲節省本文篇幅計，此處不再另述。）關於這幾種病的特殊情形，我現在都分述在下面：</p>
<p>㈠食管癌　本症多發於四十歲以上之老人；其所在部位以食管與左氣管枝之交叉點爲最多，食管下端次之。患者初時感覺閉塞，嚥下困難，其癌腫因表面膿潰而也血。周圍起化膿性炎症，並向肺心囊肋膜各方破潰，氣管枝亦因以狹窄。結果大半以饑餓致死。病之經過不滿一年。治療大抵無效。食管狹窄用消息子擴張之，但如潰爛則不相宜。如嚥下障礙，則用細消息子灌入葡萄糖等營養物於直腸，俾不到過分饑餓。注射嗎啡等麻醉劑，能抑制痙孿，其嚥下障礙時因之稍减。</p>
<p>㈡胃癌　本症大半位置於幽門腎小彎噴門等處，初起時無特殊症象。胃部或覺重壓，對於某種食物時起特殊之反感，（譬如肉魚等均可能）。惡心嘔吐，其嘔吐物時混血液，呈咖啡色，内含食物剩餘，粘液，膽汁。胃酸缺乏，中含奶酸，與胃潰瘍症中含鹽酸者不同。厥後理貧血，逐漸消瘦，其結果則現癌性惡液質而致死。本症預後不佳，亦無良好治法。Ｃｏｎｄｕｒａｕｇｏ祇有增加食慾之効，鑐錠及火Ｘ治療亦無良効，劇痛時用嗎啡等麻醉劑。惟在症象尙未明顯時，即行剖腹試騐手術，將癌腫部分切除，則較有治愈之望。</p>
<p>㈢胃潰瘍　本症患者女子每多於男子，其潰瘍大半位置於胃後壁胃小彎幽門等處，胃前壁胃大彎噴門較少。其主徵有三；胃部劇痛，嘔吐，胃出血。痛之發作，大抵在食後半小時至一時間，如攝取固形物過多，則痛愈劇；其痛如灼如切，侵延於胸骨肩胛及腹部諸處。嘔吐物帶酸性。出血多突然發作，每次多時可至一立特，其糞便常現黑色，爲本症之特徵。患者時發時愈，可遷延至數十年之久。如發生穿孔性腹膜炎及胃癌等合併症者，則大半陷於不治。治療以禁忌難消化及剌激性之食品爲主；藥物可内服次硝酸蒼鉛。Ｃｏｃａｊｎ此痛最有効，制酸劑時亦有助力。</p>
<p>㈣食管擴張症　本症或爲瀰蔓性；其局</p>
<p>部膨出者爲憩室，有二種：一爲脫出性憩室，大致因食管筋肉損傷，其停留於食管内之食物，排開筋肉纎維，致粘膜從罅隙脫出。此憩室大抵在咽及食管交界處。二曰牽引性憩室，由氣管分岐部淋巴腺發炎，與食管外壁愈着，從外方牽引食管壁，致一部分翻出，或漏斗狀。本療食物嚥下障礙，停留於食管；如發生憩室者，則食物停留於囊内，因噯氣而反流；如此食物腐敗則發口臭。凡食物入憩室中，頸部可見腫瘤，但憩室空虛則消滅。牽引性憩室無特殊症象，如無食管穿孔症時，則生前幾不可診斷。本症預後除牽引性憩室外，大抵均不良。嚥下困難愈甚者愈不良。治療　用消息子送食物至胃，　用滋養品權腸，所謂姑息療法是也。</p>
<p>㈤食管狹窄症　本症大半因隣近諸臟器腫瘤之壓迫而發生，（例如大動脈瘤）故爲次發性，此外則食管癌最易發生此患，患者嚥下困難，食物即行反流，漸漸加重，初時則因形食物，厥後即流動性食物亦不能通過，患者因此日趨消瘦，蒼白，溫度低下，治療除次發性本症須治療原病外，其僅異物存在者，可用特别消息子除去之，重者可從頸部施行手術。</p>
<p>㈥食管痙彎　本症多見於歇司得里性病人，其痙變部位多在食管最上部或最下部。患者現痙彎性嚥下困難，時兼有食管狹窄。疼痛；但有時嚥下固形食物，反較流動物爲易，是爲本病特點。治療須注重痙彎之制止，阿片劑常有效：病者多運動，能使神經系統强壯，亦有助力。</p>
<p>㈦食管麻痺　本症時爲白喉梅毒局部症象之一，或由於腦脊髓病，或由鉛及酒精中毒。患者現麻痺性嚥下困難，凡食物停留於食管時，每籍嚥下液體之重量，以降至胃内；有時因食管擴張，心肺遭壓迫，致發生心悸及呼吸困難症候。治療以原因療法爲最要，其中樞性乾預後不佳。</p>
<p>看了上面諸症的情形，我們可以曉昨膈氣這個名詞是名不符實的，患者的痛苦和膈膜或任何氣體是毫無關係的。關於諸症的結果，除癌症在近日治療學還無顯著進步，所以治愈希望很少外；像食管擴張狹窄痙彎麻痺諸症的症象，在外表觀察，幾乎和食管癌是一樣的。但並不是没有治愈的希望。尤以食管痙彎麻痺二者發生生命危險的機會是很少的。胃潰瘍要是没有合併症，　　危險也比較的不多，那對於一般人所謂膈氣决不可治說，可以說是不盡然的了。</p>

<h3>爲「風月」解嘲</h3>
<p>— 傖</p>
<p>爲了北方容易討飯吃，和上海隔絕了三四年，再回來的時候，畢竟上海是進步多了。就以小報和小期刋而論，那已是「更工難數」；更何况這些刋物的撰稿者，已換了一批嶄新的人物呢。</p>
<p>偶然翻開了幾份期刋，對於自由談的「改談風月」，都頗有「微詞」。因爲他或她們對風月的嘲笑太自由了，却激起了我這局外的風月閒人的一些感觸；但可惜我不是一個位尊襄實的巨公，不能多請一些高貴的文人，多辦幾種刋物來替風月辨誣。</p>
<p>古人論批評诗歌的方法，講究要「挾天子以令諸侯」，不過還是比喻，是異常抽象的一句話。而現在做小文章的人，却是具體的如是。譬如你是背叛了王，自然是國法具在，可以「六師及之」；不過你如果是「勤王」呢，那也是不遵王化，是「罪不容誅」的。所以「挾天子」的奥妙更是使你兩頭俱絕，正如俗諺所說，「鄉下人挑糞担，前後是屎（死的諧音）。」</p>
<p>不談風月而談正經事，那當然更不行。東漢的書獃子們憤於漢運衰微而論列是非，結果祗落得一塲禁錮捕戳，便是龜鑑。至於「風月亦不易談」，早有明哲的先生們詳論過，小子才薄，不敢多　。不過由實際的情形推論，像孔融稽康那些風月淸談，你不必撲滅牠，他們的結果也還不過是花生白酒請請客，呑呑丸藥打打鐵而己，絕對不會有什麽野心的。縱使他們潛伏着一種最大的希望吧，至多也不過想造福於阿斗，如果你是諸葛亮，倒正可以虛懐若谷，不必那樣地「鞠躬盡瘁」的。</p>
<p>然而孔融稽康等終於碰壁了，這是不是應該歸咎於風月呢？</p>
<p>我覺得，風月是無辜的。曹孟德的「對酒當歌」，終須有「明星稀」；魏晋的高雅的當權者誰不是風月的健談者？由此可見風月是平等的，奇異的是侈談風月的人，偏不許别人多談風月。這祗能說風月是脆弱的，她們很易於被姦汚，被獨佔而已。</p>
<p>不過能夠「挾天子」的人是不多的，苦命的做不通文章的文人，至多是充當「鼻孔」；假使旦狡兎絕跡，「鼻孔」的惡運便到了。同時，「挾人者人恒挾之」，另方面也須注意，如桐城派文章中所刻畫的「義犬」，是不會出現在這「人心不古」的年頭兒的。</p>
<p>學步何家幹先生，謹賦「不解放詩」四絕爲證：</p>
<p>看去江山容易改　談來風月總無邊　喬裝高雅成何用　第一切名須愛錢</p>
<p>盛朝自古說周秦　小子何須妄問津　叔夜彈琴顧影日　應傷未許作金人</p>
<p>揮毫揮　總無聊　梟傑從來起幕寮　名至利歸官九族　邊疆自有霍嫖姚</p>
<p>獻帝倉皇辭廟日　曹芳臯兀謝朝時　朝秦幕楚分中事　一樣風流錿國姨</p>
<h3>攝影塲</h3>
<p>— 林翼之</p>
<p>一切都堆得這樣雜亂，窗，門，屏風，桌椅，以及其他的一切，我疑心我是跑進了一家舊木器店的堆棧了；不，這是攝影塲（Ｓｔｕｄｉｏ）二十世紀藝術的殿堂，新時代文化的都城。</p>
<p>美國有個好萊塢，它是現代文明的禮拜堂，聽說連阿菲利加的野蠻婦人，都學會了美國明星的畫眉法和接吻術，誰說電影不是今日最有力量的宗敎呢。上海也有上海的好萊塢，我們就到這好萊</p>
<p>塢來巡禮。</p>
<p>一位導演先生領着我們到「棚」裏去，像没有燒掉以前的北火車站貨棧似的房子外，用泥土，木頭，鉛鐵皮，紙和顔料，佈着許多景，這邊一條小小的街，石庫門的白牆頭，那邊一座小山，一帶頳紅的古寺，用鉛鐵皮打成兩個大圓柱，外邊塗些爛泥，我瞧了半天，才瞧出這是古寺門前的兩株樹。爲什麽連這樣普通的外景，都要閉着門杜撰呢？導演先生給我解釋了拍製外景的麻煩，閑雜人要看女明星，趕不散；地面不平，鏡頭不便移動；還有一點我想他没說出來，就是多化錢。爲着藝術的眞，要多找麻煩，多化錢，這可有點違背資本主義藝術家的精神！</p>
<p>走進「棚」裏，撲鼻的火油氣，悶鬱的</p>
<p>氣流，暗沉沉的光線，一座富麗的宮殿，一問鄉一人家的房，什麽都靜悄悄的，祗有幾個不在鏡頭裏的工人，在流着熱汗忙碌的勞動。導演先生頽然的在一把矮椅子上坐下，管燈光的開始指揮開燈，工人像狗一樣的爬上屋頂邊。凱末拉曼移來移去對鏡頭。什麽都預備好了，祗差明星。</p>
<p>明星呢？明星到大光明看影戲去了。導演先生嘆一口氣：</p>
<p>『第一次來看拍戲的，没一個等得及！』</p>
<p>我們總算破了例，翻翻台本，談談空話·結果是等到了。一個小明星進來了，她扮一個鄉下姑娘，很觸目的穿一雙黃皮鞋。</p>
<p>『不對，不對，快去換來！』</p>
<p>『没有呀，我只有這雙鞋。』</p>
<p>接着男明星來了，笑笑，坐在一旁。　　女明星自然是最後，氣呼呼的談到化裝；</p>
<p>『觸霉頭，這樣靑布衫，身體都擦靑了。』說着，指甲搽得紅紅的手指，挾起香烟來吸，剃得狹狹的畫得長長的眉毛向上軒了軒。你會相信這是一位農村貧農家的媳婦娘麽？但是：</p>
<p>『凱末拉！』</p>
<p>在白熱的水銀燈下，膠片索索的嚮。　　『没有辦法的，說說便當，辦起來就有許多困難。』</p>
<p>所以江北碼頭夫的女兒，頭髮　得皺皺的，地產公司的女職員，享用得像一位買辦小姐。你得知道，如果頭髮不皺，眉毛不長，那還算得一位女明星麽？女明星是二十世紀的新人種，她要在國貨時裝大會裏做標本，要在慈善茶舞會裏當皇后的：</p>
<p>好，再見，攝影塲！透了一口大氣，有一個說：</p>
<p>『轉變旣然因難，就永遠扮扮摩登小</p>
<p>姐也罷！』</p>
<p>『但是摩登小姐没人看了。』</p>
<p>化兩毛小洋在銀幕上找藝術，和實際上的藝術的製造，原來是兩回事。這兩者問有一種無法消滅的矛盾，我深深的在攝影塲中體味到了。</p>
<h3>烟尾</h3>
<p>— 繆崇羣</p>
<p>似乎曾經聽見一個朋友告訴過我基督敎徒們說：</p>
<p>「一根紙烟是一根棺材釘。」</p>
<p>這話在我腦子裏停留過；多少根的釘子恐怕是釘在我的身上並且穿過了我的心。不過我不管，我這個人正要釘子常常來釘我，就是說常常需要一些刺激丨如果剌激是比較好聽的話。</p>
<p>身體可惜太不好了，這個幾乎完全廢殘了的軀殼，也確實和棺木相去不遠；但我却没有一次絕對狠心地戒過烟。</p>
<p>烟，倘使眞地象徵着棺釘和它的厲害，那麽許許多多根的釘子，也許正是我</p>
<p>應該準備下來的罷。</p>
<p>寂寞常常做了我的伴侶，有了他我才覺到充實；繼續而長久一些的充實，於是烟又成了寂寞的唯一的伴侶。我親近自己的伴侶，同時我又發覺了我們有着一樣的運命。我是一個没有一點理性的人，我的眼晴能夠看見的東西，我就以爲和他們是一樣的生存。一支一支短短的烟草，我看見的他們都是有着他們自己的運命。</p>
<p>他們一大半是消滅在過去了的燃燒裏，那殘餘下來的一截運命過程，在我的腦裏映着的恐怕也就是我自己的殘餘運命的一個縮影。他有知，他定會對於他的伴侶有着信心。</p>
<p>丢到風吹的地方去，他会乘風繼續的</p>
<p>燃燒，直燃燒到死。丢到落雨的地方去，他可以居心徼倖，等待着那一個不知道什麽時候到來的雨滴，正正打中了他，他再長斯而盡。要不然也不要風，也不要雨，儘自藏在一個角落的地方，能夠悠悠地燃燒着自己，他的氣息也許會格外地使人掩鼻。</p>
<p>可恥的！只有不死不活而依然留在地上的一截斷尾爲可恥！</p>
<p>燃燒，就烯燒完了；是釘子，就要是不容人看見的狠狠地釘到底。</p>

<p>宋袁褧『楓窗小牘』載：</p>

<p>這一則很可編入『論語』的『幽默文選』。猴子旣然做官，馬兒自不甘屈伏，鳴跳不馴，裝腔作勢，此乃事之必然。可是，終竟是『裝腔作勢』而已，所以，封官以後，馬上就『帖然就曫』，不再『鳴跳』了，這『帖然』二字，可謂神來之筆</p>

<h3>平凡的事（七）</h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>「你倒眞的會算」，佩萸像生氣似地說，「你去收拾車子罷。」</p>
<p>她說完就向自己的臥房裡走，這時候，伯唐從床上披着浴衣預備下樓去問阿明，佩萸立在床邊高聲向他說：</p>
<p>「你昨天晚上不聽我的話，現在，人己經尋不着了！」</p>
<p>「尋不着？怎様？」伯唐從容地問。</p>
<p>她連報告帶埋怨把阿明的話向他說了一遍；接着又說：</p>
<p>「這都是你們從容幹好事的結果！」</p>
<p>「阿明的猜想，有幾分對，」伯唐說：「之光固然不會亂跑，廠裡的人也不會爲難他。」</p>
<p>「那末，儘管他們走得慢，這時候也應當到了！旣然你說阿明猜得，何以他們還不來呢？」　　「這一層，我倒不能就馬上答復你······」</p>
<p>「那末，」佩萸搶着說，「可見得阿明猜得不對了！」</p>
<p>「你又來武斷了！」</p>
<p>「你旣然不能　馬上答復我，就不必說我武斷！」</p>
<p>「我雖然不能猜想結果，但是從動機上看來，你儘可以不必着急······」</p>
<p>「甚麽動機？······動機是怎的？」</p>
<p>「動機就是接濟呀！題目旣然這樣漂亮，他們預備做的文章也一定光鮮，因此你不必爲「人</p>
<p>「着急。」</p>
<p>「你說我不必爲人着急，那末你着急的是甚麽？」</p>
<p>「我着急的，就是他們對於接濟品物質上的希望太大。」</p>
<p>「他們恐怕你不肯滿足他們的希望，那末就牽到「人」的身上了。」</p>
<p>「然而這就不是漂亮題目的光鮮文章了。」</p>
<p>她似乎有點相信了，隨意他向床上一坐：</p>
<p>「那末，你總要想法子呌他們穩照光鮮的做才好。」</p>
<p>「對的，我現在預備吃點東西，就到大南門廠裏去······」</p>

<h3>棉農改良棉花之方法馮肇傳</h3>
<p>近年來棉花進口，一躍而爲各貨之冠，其値最高時，竟達一億八千萬海關兩，漏巵之鉅，實足驚人。考棉花進口之所以激增，其重要原因凡二：㈠原棉供不應求，試觀十九年至二十一年，最近三年中，全國原棉銷費量每年平均廠家方面計需八，九二一，七二七担，衣被手紡方面約需二百萬担，共需一○，九二一，七二七担，而國内自產棉花，每年平均爲七，七七一，六六一担，除輸出七五九，五五七担外，僅餘七，○一二，一○四担，若以生產與消費互相比較，則每年國内平均缺少棉花三，九○九，六二三担，是以此三年間，外棉進口平均每年竟達三，九四○，六九○担之鉅，乃國内棉產缺乏，有以促成之也。㈡原棉質不適用，國内紡織由粗趨精，製紗重心，由十六支移至二十支，是以最近三年中，紗廠用棉成分中，棉由百分之六三·一一遞減至五二·一三，印棉自百分之二二·七六遞減至八·八一，其他各棉由百分之○·三二遞減至○·○三，而美棉則由百分之一三·六○激增至三八·五八，埃及棉自百分之○·二一，激增至○·四五，粗短之棉，用途日削，而細長之棉，諎要日多，我國自產之棉，品質本劣，復因攙水攙雜，益形不適廠家之用，而外棉乃乘機傾銷於我國矣。旣知棉花進口最近驚人之紀錄，其　結在棉之量，又在棉之質，則吾人欲謀解决此嚴重之問題，當亦不外乎在棉之質量雙方努力改良而巳。雖然，我國改良植棉事業，自民初迄今，而成績終未昭著者，蓋非全體棉農加入植棉運動，努力生產，力求改良，而徒藉寥寥數試騐塲，或農學校之植棉推廣，自無濟事之望。爰就個人見解所及，述棉農改良棉花之方法，以供</p>
<p>海内棉農之採納。</p>
<h3>（甲治標方法）</h3>
<p>我國棉花產額之不足，品</p>
<p>質之退化，由於先天之缺點者固多，而由於人事之關係者，亦復不少。農民倘能略加注意，而求棉花之改良，誠易如反掌耳。茲擇其主要者，略述如次：</p>
<p>（一、改良收穫）</p>
<p>普通收花，恒將早中晚各汛所收棉花，不論好壞，混合一起·不知各汛怕收花衣，長短不等，品質亦殊，一經混合，則花衣良窳夾雜，參差不齊，最爲紗廠所忌。我國棉產中不乏少數優良花衣，然因收穫關係，斷送殆盡。某紗廠經理曾語著者云，「現在國内花衣，良窳不齊，夾雜不堪，長中夾短，短羢固成廢花，卽短中夾長，亦徒然枉費，以之製紗，粗細不匀，費工耗本，遠不若外棉之長絨者卽爲長絨！短絨者卽爲短絨，可隨需要辦貨，卽極方便，又極經濟，是以一般紗廠家恒有不得已而迫用外棉之苦衷。」足見改善收穫方法，實爲農民改良棉花急不容緩之要務。假定農民於收花時，能分期收穫，並將黃花劣花另行收採，則向之花衣長短不齊，良窳夾雜，不適紗廠需要者，均可一變而爲等級分明，整齊純一，廠家何苦而必用外棉哉。最近上海商品檢騐局擬有就地檢騐棉花之創議，意欲棉民於軋花打包時，卽備一「忠實」的小樣於包外，以便政府檢騐水分，評定品級等用，而不必啟用大包，揀取貨樣。斯法用意至善，尙望政府能得早日實行，棉農能遵照辦理</p>
<p>，廠家並能對於此種「貨眞價實」的棉花，優價</p>
<p>收買，則農民自必樂爲矣。</p>
<p>（二革除惡習）</p>
<p>我國一部分農民，於收穫後，每每有攙水攙雜，並有攙劣攙僞，以增加重量而求意外之利者，此固農民之惡習，要亦花行紗廠於無意中有以促成之耳。蓋作弊者因毫無任何牽制，而樂得小利，不作弊者亦並無任何優待條件，而反受虧損，於是無人不作弊，無花不有弊，而棉花霉爛夾雜，良者變劣，劣者竟不成其爲花衣。我國棉花如此斵喪斷送而不合紡織之用者，每年不知凡幾，殊可痛惜。現在政府雖已設立專局實行檢騐，然而法規愈嚴，而作弊益工，欲求農民革除此積習，端在紗廠及花行，能切實一致，優價獎勵，不作弊之花衣，以恊助政府檢騐之工作。如是則農民有利可圖，何苦必欲作弊而犯法哉！農民之惡習旣除，吾國自產棉花適合應用之成分，自當增加不少。</p>
<p>（三驅除病蟲害）</p>
<p>病蟲害之足以減少棉花產量，夫人而知之，病蟲害之足以損壞棉花品質，則知之者較少。據上海商品檢騐局之測騐，紅鈴蟲爲害，顯然足以减少棉絨之天然　曲數及其强度，蟲害之足以損壞棉質，此其證也。又如棉疳病等，能使被害棉花變害損傷，不合紡紗之用，此又病害之足以損壞棉質之證也。我國棉田素不講求淸潔，病蟲爲害，特别猖獗，產量削減，品質變劣，棉產之損失殊大。棉農倘能於蟲害病害未發生以前，遵照農業機關之指導，於可能範圍内實行預防，於旣發生之後，努力撲減，以絕後患，並能將被害棉花，另行收採，不使混入良棉，則我國棉花之產量，旣可增加，而品質亦可免受後天之種種損害，原棉之改良，操　券可待矣。</p>
<h3>乙治本方法</h3>
<p>我國原棉產量之低落，品質之退化，其主要根本之缺點，乃在㈠棉種之不改良，㈡裁培之不講究，㈢棉農之無組織。爲對症發藥計，農民誠宜注全力於此三項，而速求改進。改進之法，略述如下；</p>
<p>（一改良棉種）</p>
<p>現在作物，改良種子，最新各方法，不外乎㈠引用良種；丨卽引用别國或别地已著成效之良種，加以馴化，使適本地種植，此乃利用已有良種之主法也。㈡純系選種；丨卽採集大批品種，品系，或個體，加以精密之比較試騐，而後選擇其中之目的物，維護繁殖，以供種植，此乃就自然界原有或新產之優良品種，用人工選出，以供應用之方法也。㈢雜交育種；丨卽選擇其具有特優性狀之品性若干，行人工交配，使舉凡一切優良性狀，熔合一爐，薈萃個體，而成一盡善盡美合乎理想之品種，此乃就自然界原有良種，加以人工之支配，育成新種之方法也。㈣人工誘變；丨應Ｘ用光或雷光照射法，引誘生物之突變，在大麥已告成切，科學進步神速，最近斯間，作物育種，當可應用此法，引起種種突變，以增多選擇之材料，而育成自然界難於產生之新品種焉。此乃應用科學，制勝自然，而求改良之方法也。棉花種子之改良，要亦不外應用此種種方法而已，雖然以此四法責諸歐美農民之應用，勢或不成，遑論，我國之棉農。爲求切實起見，請論我國棉農可以實行之棉種改良法如下。</p>
<p>㈠接受良種　我國棉農，一部不自留種，每年從花行紗廠或棉子販手中購買來源不明，混雜不堪之棉種，以供種植。一部分雖自留種，或因種性本來不良，或因種雖良而選種不得其法，種子卒致退化。所用之種子，旣已退化，將來之棉花，焉能望其良好。而農民不解，對於改良棉種，呀懷疑而摒棄不用，或竟仇視之而羣起反對，此種自暴自棄自殺之劣根性，亟宜完全剷除。剷除之法端，在指導者用種種方法，使棉農認識改良種子之重要。而樂於接受改良棉種之使命，實爲目下最要之任務。</p>
<p>㈡注意補種　天時瞬息多變，無論何地何年，棉苗之死亡，恒有不可或免之傾向。棉苗旣死，勢必補種。補種之訣，宜用預留改良品種之種子，萬萬不能隨意補種其他土種，以免棉產之夾雜，棉種之混淆。</p>
<p>㈢去劣去僞　棉籽在田間，旣有自然雜交之機會，以用各種變異之發生，而於收穫軋花運輸時，在在且有機械混合之危險，是以去劣去僞，實爲維護棉產，純一棉種純潔之緊要工作。能於棉苗時期，卽行著手，則其損失，最少卽在長成時期，苟遇僞劣亦應不惜犧牲而拔去之。然一般農民衹顧目前而不肯聽從，推廣機關人員，或可應用獎勵政策，促其實現，而養成去劣去僞之習慣。</p>
<p>㈣自留種子　農民宜自行留種，中汛生長最旺之種子，晒乾自軋，妥然貯藏，以備次春之用。</p>
<p>㈤按期換種　農民領種之棉花，於三五年後，不無發生變化，農民旣無能力，亦無時間行育種工作，是以每三年或五年可向試騐塲調換新種，以免退化之弊。</p>
<p>㈥合作繁種　農民中有比較開通者，（甲）可與棉塲共同組織合作棉田，用簡單的混合選良法，繁殖優良種子，以供自用，並供其他棉農之用。（乙）或仿印度之棉子合作團，數戶，合作，公辦種子田，請棉塲之指導，共同繁殖優良種子，以供團内，兼供團外棉農之用。</p>
<p>大多數棉農，旣能自留改良種子，少數優秀者，並能合作繁殖優良種子，以供其他農民之用，且同時有政府之棉業改良塲爲其後盾，加以指導；如是則全國棉農，富有全體樂於取用改良種子之希望矣。</p>
<p>（㈡改良裁培）</p>
<p>改良棉種，旣具優良之遺傳本性，同時必有良好之所在環境，方能充分發展其良好性狀，而獲得圓滿之收穫。棉之環境，一如其他植物，日土壤環境，日生物環境，日氣候環境，此三者全部或一部，均可由栽培方法左右之。爰述改良之方法如次：</p>
<p>㈠改良土壤環境　植棉時。棉種最初接觸之環境，卽爲土壤，土垠中水分温度養料等等，適宜與否，一視耕耘施肥等手　之勤情得失而爲轉移。土壤環境適宜者，棉之產量固可登多，而品質亦恒隨之良好。例如幼鈴初結。棉絨方長之期，棉株得適量之水分者，其絨恒得充分之發展，旣長且細。美國棉花品評家根據　纎維長短及其品性而能判斷其來自何區，蓋亦深</p>
<p>知土壤水分等與絨長關係　切耳。又如施肥，缺少鉀質，則僵辦多，僵辦中棉絨恒失却强力與今曲，品質遂致减色。我國棉農或限於資本，或由於習慣，對於施肥及耕耘，最不講求，亟宜注意及此，以求棉花質量之改進。</p>
<p>㈡改良氣候環境　氣候中之日光濕度氣濕雨量等，對於棉產之成功與失敗，其重要不亞於土壤，例如纎維最長之海島棉，只能在濕度滋潤之區，如美洲沼海之海島及西印度羣島生長繁榮。又如埃及棉之祗宜於光强温高之美國之西南，斐洲之埃及等處，他若多雨低温之處，不能種植，氣候之足以限制優良棉種之勢力，更大於土壤矣。雖然一般農人以爲氣候乃由於天時，人工不能支配，無能爲力，不知栽培方法，亦有足以影響氣候環境之關係焉。例如我國棉農，旣信撒播，尤喜密種，枝葉互蔽，日光不足，空氣阻滯，地面蒸發陰濕過度，縱在天氣晴朗，風雨調順之時季，亦造成一種惡劣</p>
<p>環境，長此栽培，棉花生長，豈能良好。故棉農亟應接受植棉新法，注意間苗於一定距離，留定棉株，務使棉花疏密適度，而不至使巳有良好環境，變爲惡劣，實爲要務。</p>
<p>㈢改良生物環境　棉之生物環境，如土壤中根疣菌，空氣中之各種病菌，各種棉蟲，或有補益，或有損害，其受栽培之影響亦大。例如我國浙江及南通一帶棉民，恒於冬季麥行中種苜蓿，以利用土壤中根瘤菌製成之氣質，以爲基肥，此類良好習慣，他區棉民，誠宜一律仿效舉行，至於棉楷放棄於棉田，經冬不拔，一任病菌之胞子，害虫之卵蛹藏蔽，各得其所，</p>
<p>來春再度爲害等惡習慣，亦宜澈底痛改，舉凡</p>
<p>可以改良棉花之生物環境者，亦卽所以改良棉花之方法，幸注意及之。</p>
<p>㈣改良組織　我國棉農可說毫無組織，是以棉子肥料，農具，運輸銷售等等，無一不受一般奸商及資本家之操縱限制及宰割。負復興農村之責者，欲望棉農棉花之改良，對於棉農之組織，實爲先决問題。蓋棉花無論如何改良，而棉農等苟無組織，則植棉大利，仍爲一般奸商及資本家所脧削，絲毫難歸於棉農耳。目下棉區最需要之組織，卽爲合作事業。而合作事業中最切現在需要者：厥爲㈠信用合作；丨中國農夫向以貧窮著聞，而在海濱山麓等區，墾荒植棉者，類皆窮中之尤窮者，故其經濟之因難，較普通農民更甚。際此生產乏資，借貸無門之時，當局者能指導棉民，組織信用合作社，實爲當务之急。蓋旣可免除重利盤剥，復可助其及時作業也。㈡生產合作，丨最近有主張組織生產合作社，代辦種子肥料農具甡畜等生產必需之品，供給社員，如是則農民得有生產之資料，而無浪費或挪欵别用之弊。本此原則進行，則生產合作社之欵項，可望盡用於生產，而銀行之放欵，更多一保障。法至善也。㈢運銷合作，丨棉農手足胼胝，終年辛苦，彼等惟一之希望與安慰，厥在優厚之價格，最後之純利。而現在各處花價，尤其是内地，花價一任花商偏面之意志，自由决定，農民爲經濟所迫，棉花豋塲，急於求售，祗能聽其支配，無能爲力，實爲天下最不公平之事實。亟宜指導棉農，組織運消合作社，務使棉農能得公允之價格爲要。益有進者，農民因經濟之壓迫，普通恒向商店或向資本家借貸銀錢或肥料種子等，從事生產，而彼商店等爲維持私　利見，亦卽以此脅迫農民，使其不能改用改良棉花之種子，不能接受植棉改良之新法，此事於浙江已經證實，是以欲求棉農棉花之改良，而不能首先指導棉農組織起來，完全脫離農村舊有之惡環境，則一切宣傳，一切推廣，與夫一切復興農村運動之力量與影響，斷不能與盤踞農村，根深蒂固之惡勢力，互相頡抗，而事業亦因此絕無成功之希望。願負復興農村之責者，注意及之也。</p>
<h3>棉作栽培方法之改進　孫恩麔</h3>
<p>發展棉產，有有兩個途徑，㈠增加棉田面積，㈡就現有棉田增加每畝出產，前爲推廣，後爲改良，茲專論改良。</p>
<p>棉作改良復分三端：㈠改良棉種，㈡改良棉作栽培法，㈢防治棉作病蟲害。三者之中，第二項最爲重要：因爲改良棉種，必需栽培適當，主得成効顯著；防治蟲病，又賴耕種得法，才能防患未然。所以改進栽培，乃育種與防治蟲病之中樞問題，不容忽視。</p>
<p>然而棉作栽培一道，夫豈易言，土壤氣候，</p>
<p>各處不同，天然環境，非人力所能隨意變更。甲地種棉良法，乙地或不適用；今年所宜工作，明年或不相宜。精於此者，貴能因時制宜，隨地變通，不可默守成法，執泥不化。是故改進棉作栽培，應當認明天然背景，善加處理，此其一。又如農工之多寡，農村經濟之裕否，以及田制大小，物價貴賤，種種情形，各地亦復不同。某種農具，在甲地必需使用，或不適用於乙地；某種工作，在丙地普通施行，有時或在丁地爲不勝算。孰利我弊？孰宜孰否？又當認明農村社會的背景，而善爲調度，此其二。因此之故，作者不能寫也一篇到處適用的棉作栽培法，也不能指定何項工作，應如何改良：只可就棉作栽培上較不重要幾點，加以討論，略示改良之途徑而已。</p>
<p>㈠棉田兩熟制的問題</p>
<p>北幾省（如河北河南山東山西等）的生長季較短，棉田中只需一熟，冬季完全休閒，以前種中棉如是，現在　美棉也如是。南幾省（如湖南浙江江西等）的生長季較長，棉田中除夏季生長棉花外，冬季仍可種植冬作，以前種中棉是這樣，現在種美棉也是這樣。惟有中部幾省（如江蘇安徽湖北等）生長季長短得中，如種中</p>
<p>棉，不妨冬作之耕種：若種美棉，便不能再種冬作。換言之，田内有了冬作，如種中棉，不相妨碍；若種美棉，棉花的收成，勢將大受影響。謹諸作者多年試騐結果，麥田種美棉，在尋常年歲，收成每甚歉薄，惟有秋天氣候特别順適，而春夏氣候不好的年頭，麥田美棉的收成，才能與冬閒地的美棉相等，這是十年中難得一年的機會。可見美棉田不宜種麥，麥田不能種美棉，已無疑義。所以在中部各省，如欲提倡美棉，最好犧牲冬季作物，專種一熟美棉，因其品質良好，產力豐富，經濟上仍屬合算。此項變更，在他國農制較大，農村經濟較好，不難一轉移間可卽實現。但是我國情形不同，農民窘困，春季食糧，專賴麥熟接濟；故寗可犧牲品質良好急切需用之美棉不事種植，不願抛棄利薄多勞之麥作而利周轉，這是我國社會背景影響及於棉作改良之一例，也是我國研究棉作栽培的物殊困難之一種。作者研究此項問題，前後將近十年，希良從栽培上得着相當辦法，使美棉及冬作在中部各省可以並行不悖。茲將研究所得，摘要舉例如左：</p>
<p>㈠裸麥爲美棉田之冬作，比小麥蠶豆豌豆油菜坸較好。㈡要裸麥行間條播美棉，行株距均不可過寬。行距以一尺二寸至一尺五寸爲宜，株距以五六寸爲宜。㈢美棉種於冬閒地中宜早（　雨左右）但種於裸麥行間則又不宜過早（立夏至立夏後數日），因恐棉苗受困於麥蔭下，時間過久，將來不能發旺，不如播種稍遲。發芽後不外便可割麥爲得計。㈣割麥後田中如嫌太乾，最好水一次　，且施與速效肥料，以促棉苗生長，不使虛度光陰。用費雖大，收益可以補償有餘。㈤美棉裸麥雨熟，時季上旣感覺短促，應卽選用成熟較早之美棉及裸麥品種，以資補救。㈥晚秋種麥時，美棉鈴未吐絮者，當屬不少，不妨拔起棉株，善爲處置，尙可逐漸開放，無傷色澤。損失固不能免，幸爲數不大。</p>
<p>（二）施肥問題</p>
<p>麥田種棉，無論其爲中棉或美棉，施肥上均有應當研究之必要。棉花播種，時當麥將成熟，不可施與肥料，因恐延緩麥之成熟故也。麥旣離田，棉苗正需肥料，無如時値乾季，施肥又不易見效，不久入霉，淫雨時至，追補之肥料，又有被雨冲失肥份之危險。故習慣上每於霉雨後施肥，時季旣晚，遂不得不用速效肥料。有用人糞尿者，施用不便，費工極多，每爲人所不取。豆餅性旣迅速，肥份亦富，幾成爲我國棉田最重要之肥料。而棉餅出自棉籽，從來源上及肥份上言，應爲棉花最好而最經濟之肥料。只因見效稍緩，棄而不用，反爲日人所收買。以是我國棉區農民，每年賣出自家生產之棉餅，轉買他人出產之豆餅，一出一進，轉運之費用，商行之佣金，以及其他損失，爲數實大，不可不設法挽救之。嘗考美國種棉，只用棉餅，不用豆餅。且查該國騐試塲試騐結果：棉餅對於棉花之效力，比任何餅類爲大，作者前至東南大學試騐，亦曾證明棉田施用棉餅，比豆餅及菜子餅均不稍遜。可見棉餅是棉花的好肥料，毫無疑義。乃我國因棉田冬季種麥的關係，又因收麥後天氣先旱後雨的原因，棉餅不能從早施用，致使其特殊的利益，不爲一般農民所認識，是誠大可惜也。爲今之計，吾人應當研究棉田施用棉餅之適當力法，去其弊而收其利，則於棉區農民之經濟，卽可大有裨益，其法如何？作者在南通學院裏農科正商仝農藝化學系在研究中，一面在室内考究其發酵情形，於普通棉田施肥前，加以適當調製；一面在田間試騐其見效速度，以爲施用適期之探討。茲據已知之事實，主張左列各點：</p>
<p>㈠棉餅確爲棉花之良好肥料，吾國農民應注意其利用。㈡麥田施肥，與其用人糞尿爲追肥，不如用棉餅爲基肥。若於早春施用棉餅，其餘剩力量，仍可有利於棉之發育。㈢如用棉餅爲棉田追肥，應使先期令其發酵，庶下田後效力易見。㈣一熟田之棉花，如從早施用棉餅，以同價論，其效力至少與豆餅相等。　　（三）播種及除草中耕問題</p>
<p>北方人　，用以條播百穀，棉花因之，中美棉皆然。南方農民不知利用此器，條播維艱。故種棉多行撒播，中棉然，美棉亦然。嘗考美棉植體肥大，占地宜廣，撒播每易留苗過密，殊非所宜。而條播因行距寬至二尺以上，費工不多，故尙不難推行。惟中棉植體較小，占地較狹，如行條播，行距以一尺二寸左右爲宜，其工作比美棉幾多一倍。苟無條播器械，專賴手鋤爲之，費工甚大。故在南方種植中棉，而欲改行條播，非易事也。雖然，棉花播種方式，與將來之除草中耕工作，大有關係，撒播田中，棉苗地位錯亂，除草費工極多；惟其如是，鋤地卽不能勤，雜草多時，必不得已才施工一次，無草鮮有鋤地者。故謂南方人種棉，只知除草，不知中耕，非過論也。至大署處署間，南方有時患旱，棉花正值黃花盛開時，受旱則花蕾脫落，鈴實不多，收色大受减色。考其釀成損失之原因，氣候只居小半，中耕不勤，不能保持表土宣鬆，减少地面蒸發，實應負其大部分之責任。蓋南方雖有時缺雨，究竟絕少久旱。一月不雨，在表土宣鬆之棉田中，下層水分尙足，不致感覺亢旱。而撒播之田，地面堅緊，水分由地面蒸發而衷失者，爲量極大；苟非雨水特别調順，源源供給水分，則落花脫鈴，隨之而起，旱災現象，繼以發現。此豈氣候之罪？抑亦咎由自取也！是故棉田不能耐旱，其近因，由於中耕之不力，其遠因則由於撒播之不當。窮本尋源，仍繫於播種方式一問題！作者對此研究所得，總括如左列各端。</p>
<p>㈠美棉固應條播，中棉亦以條播爲宜。但條播中棉之行距。不可太寬，如寬至一尺六寸以上，則收成减少之危險甚大，適當行距，以一尺二寸爲中，至少一尺，至多一尺五寸。㈡條播美棉，以美國式之單行，玉米棉花兩用播種器爲最好。美國南方通用之棉花播種器次之。（中大農學院及江蘇省立農具製造所均彷製之。）北方之獨脚縷及兩脚縷，亦可在南方使用，但用之者須有經騐，播種多寡及深淺才有把握。至用犁開溝，播種犁溝中，然後用耙或手鋤覆土，亦無不可，惟恐失之過深。㈢空地條播中棉，如用單行播種器，工作尙嫌不速。南脚縷可種兩行，似較合用。若無現成器械，可製麥作育種用之開行器一架，（用橫木一條，長五尺，上釘楔式尖頭木齒四個至六個，相距一尺至尺半，可以隨意活動。）一趟開溝四行至六行。如治地平整，開溝深淺，正爲合宜。然後用人工下種，以耙蓋土，工作進行，尙不過慢。㈣麥行中條播中棉，須先用鋤開溝，每畝多費兩個人工。至下種及覆土，則與麥行中撒播相同。按條播此時費工雖較多，以後除草中耕均甚便利，可以防備旱患，减少損失，利益甚大。㈤棉花行間除草中耕，以鋤爲之，費工甚多。最好用牛拖五齒中耕器，往來極速，一人一牛，每日可工作十五畝至二十五畝。但以行距一尺六寸爲最小限度，小於此者，則不便用牛中耕，故此僅對美棉適用，對中棉尙未盡合。若中棉行距爲一尺二寸至一尺五寸，可用歐美通用之園圃手推中耕器，每人每日可工作二畝左右，比用手鋤至少可快兩倍。</p>
<p>㈣摘心與整枝</p>
<p>南方種植中棉，有的地方摘心，有的地方不摘心。摘心的地方，年年摘心，而以不摘心爲不合。不摘心的地方，亦復年年不摘心，而以摘心爲多事，是則摘心或不摘心，成爲各地的習慣法，一成不變，似乎各有所宜，不可絲毫變通者也。其實摘心的作用，在乎抑止棉植生長過旺，摘去頂心，促其傍枝發育，以利開花結鈴，不致正幹冲天向上，徒長高大而已。故摘心之須行與否，應視棉植生長狀况而定。肥田固利於棉植發育，但一遇旱年，因受水分供給之限制，則不得充分暢茂。是以肥田以摘心爲常例者，旱年則不必摘心，反而言之，薄地棉植發育欠佳，常例不需摘心，然苟遇雨水特别匀順之年，有時偶呈徒長現象，摘心亦可應用以致利。更考金鋼鑽虫蝕害花蕾及幼鈴，每每損失甚大。據棉作害虫專家研究：金鋼鑽在棉花嫩頭上產卵，卵之平均期爲六天半，又幼虫孵出後，留於嫩頭之上，又有五天半，然後方下去尋花果爲食，是則在此十二天内，如行摘心，則金鋼鑽之卵及幼虫，可以隨時毀滅。明乎此，則棉花之應行摘心與否　又當視金鋼鑽　生多寡及其產卵孵化時期爲定標，尤非泥執習慣所能蔵事也。</p>
<p>北方種植美棉，又有整枝辦法。棉苗高至盈尺時，基部如有葉枝萌發，隨將已發出之葉枝之芽採去。嗣後棉苗向上生長正速，中下部果枝亦向四面射出，至苗高二尺半左右，再將正心摘去。棉苗旣不得向上發育，中下部果枝遂卽繼續伸長，上部果枝亦卽繼起直追，不稍落後。不久，果枝各伸長至尺許以至二尺，節節發蕾開花，尖部仍伸長不已。乃於此時復將各果枝之尖端摘去，移注其全力於花果方面，促成其結。但此時棉植發育力極强，除開花結果外，復於果枝基部及枝上之各節發生小葉枝，以洩其餘力，整枝者，更於此種小葉枝萌發之際，隨時抺去其已發或未發之芽，於是全部力量，終得完全輸送於鈴果之部，大而且多，開裂亦速。如是棉花整枝工作，每畝需多費人工七八工以至十餘工，但在北省生長季甚短，氣候又極乾旱，美棉能得豐穫者，整枝之功甚大，不可滅也。雖然，此項方法之應用，亦有研究餘地。在氣候乾旱之處可行，在雨水較多之地，則未見其適合。因整枝所以節制幹與枝之發育，花節之數，受有限制。如當開花之際，陰雨連綿，落花必多。落一花則少一果。正幹傍枝又均失其延長能力，不能繼續開花，補救損失，勢必至於棉植空疏，收成欠薄，殊不合算。且整枝之棉株，傍枝向外四射，正幹不再上長，空間旣不能盡量利用，勢需放寬行株間距離，資其發展。如此疏植稀留，只可宜於肥地，而不利於瘠土。瘠土中棉植發育不大，距離宜密，苟因預備整枝而稀留，每每易招損失，不可不愼。故整枝一法，在北方雖認爲可行，又須視氣候土壤之不同而善爲變通也。</p>
<p>總而言之，改良棉作栽培法，應就天然環境，及農村社會情形，隨時隨地，分别設施。上述各節，不過爲栽培上較爲重要幾點，用以表示其伸縮性，不能認定一種方法，而卽可一成不變，亦不能謂栽培改進之道，盡在乎是。誠以我國一般農人對於栽培工作　　　　法默守，不事變通，要因知識薄弱，不明生物與環境之變化的關係所致。而一般初學農事者，因其屬望於農學至大，又以爲一學農事，便可無所不曉，着手成春，殊不知百業改良之難，莫過於農，棉爲農作之一，當然不能例外。作者反覆陳述此意，蓋希望學農同志，對於各人專政之科目，深加探討，精益求精；幸勿徒究膚淺自足，不能爲農民造福耳！（二二、六、四、南</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>署期生活的商確</h3>
<p>— 琪玲</p>
<p>流光如駛，轉瞬間署假已過去一週了·兩個月的長時期，炎熱悶人的日子，署假期中計劃做些什麽工作，當然是値得討論的一個問題。日前本刋天龍君已屬文談過，他的意思是專心致力於功課體育等等，計劃固然是很好的，但我以爲除了溫習功課，體育以外，還應當做些工作，現在且寫出來和高明者商確。</p>
<p>（一）考察社會的工作　第一句我先在問：「我們讀了書是否是準備將來爲應付社社之用？」假如是的，那末，大可利用此長時期的署假，跟着我們的父兄，或是親朋，祗要是在社會上做工的，去觀察社會工作的習慣，人情，待週等等，不論何業，都可以去觀光的。因爲社會的種種，和學校中是絕對不同，我們旣然準備將來獻身於社會，則何不未雨綢繆，先得些經騐？熟語說：「經騐即學問」。免得將來到社會去工作時，感受多方的不便。</p>
<p>（二）調查農村的工作　中國的農村是破產了！試看從前素稱以農立國，現在却洋米洋麥不斷的進口，這便是一個很明顯的確證。靑年學子們固常常自命爲中國未來的主人翁，而且也常常有到農村去的口號，即使新進的電影也常常以此爲宣傳的資料·不過，口頭上盡是說得天花飛墜，頑石點頭，實際試問可曾有人到過農村去調查，眞是不言可知·我們學生們平時終日處身校中，很少機會去與農民羣衆接近，何不利用此署假，結伴旅行，到農村去調查一切，看農民們的生活狀况如何·研究農村破產的原因何在·我想，實際工作的體騐所求得的，較書本上總要切得多，况且又可藉此行些戶外生活，一舉數得，何樂不爲？</p>
<p>（三）嘗試敎師的工作　中國不識字的人太多了！論起人口來到有四萬萬七千多萬，實則到有半數是開眼的瞎子，現在國人們積極謀補救的方針，所以署期的平民學校，很多的地方在創辦，我們不妨去盡些義務，當個敎師，一方面觀察自己的敎授能力，一方面爲社會的平民造福不淺。</p>
<p>（四）實習投稿的工作　我們學習了當然要實騐的，可是學校中給於我們作文賽騐的機機太少，同時，我們要想實騐也没有時間，署期中空閒着，我們可以從社會的考察，農村的調查的結果，以及自己個人的雜感，隨筆，寫些稿件投到報紙或雜誌上去·寫得好不好及有無希望登載，那是另一問題，大可不必顧慮，練習我們自己的文筆是實·倘使登載了，說句寒氣話，也可以得些稿費，貼補零用，因爲父母們一年已爲我們化了不秒的金錢了。</p>
<p>綜合上面的四種工作，第三項於早晨做，第四項側於晚間做，第一三項可以不必固定時間。空餘的時候，再自己溫習功課，體育，星期日則照例休息。如此，倘能切實去做，方不負此長期的署假，否則，看看電影，閱閱小說，游游公園，盡情荒廢，冶蕩，我們决不能承認他是個時代的靑年。</p>
<h3>徒唤何益！　江水日漲</h3>
<h3>甜蜜的夢</h3>
<p>— 魔娟</p>
<p>是夕陽躱在西山的黃昏時候·</p>
<p>碧的天幕，靑的水波，整個的宇宙，都給晚霞扮飾成鋒紅色·這時我徘徊在一間陳設富麗的大廳中，甚麽畫樑雕梀，寳石水晶，抺簾繡幔等應有儘有；這是一間富有古羅馬風化的宮殿·那時我曾想到；我已達到了理想中的皇宮和樂園的目的地了·</p>
<p>當我正在默想時，電鈴突然響了。珠簾啓處，莉妹嫺嫺地走來，今天，她是格外的美麗動人；穿着一件河綠色的長旗袍，胸前微微隆起，襯托着纎細的腰肢，愈顯得曲線美的豐富！</p>
<p>哈囉！Ｄａｒｌｉｎｇ！你感到寂寞嗎？她媚笑地說；嬌聲像打碎水晶瓶般動聽·</p>
<p>那時，我整個的身子輕飄起來，像在霞光中天使一牰的快活，高興地說：　　來吧！Ｍｙ　Ｑｕｅｅｎ！你來呵！	我正需要你來伴我呢！</p>
<p>這時，月姐已出山了·她偷窺着我倆秘密似的，早已羞得躱在浮雲裏了·　　我啊！不想這柔弱的我，今晚有這樣的勇氣，大膽地把她擁抱了·甜密地吻了她·</p>
<p>奇怪，媽媽喚了一聲，我醒了，睜開眼來，她在那裏呢？一切都化爲烏有眼前是一個月色的夜，一片黑暗·唉！夢是不常的，甜蜜的夢更是空虛的，只有努力奮鬬得來的實生活，才是甜蜜和幸福呢·</p>

<h3>養女淚</h3>
<p>編緝先生：</p>
<p>我是一爿大商店裏的小職員，每月的薪俸，是十餘元；勉强可以相安無事。在八年前，我的慈母，不幸死了。在那時，我的父親，娶了一個女子，就是我的繼母。在第二個月，她買了一個女　，那時的待遇，還算好。後來我的繼母生了一個女　之後，對於那買來的女　，加以虐待；終日謾駡，時加責打。唉！可憐我的妹妹，艱苦忍耐地過了五年；今年她已十八歲了。但是我的繼母，近來是變本加厲，來威逼她嫁給一位團長。但是這團長已有三十多歲了，而且是已娶妻的！雖說已經是死了，但仍疑信參半，我勢利的繼母，爲着豐富的聘金，就强逼我的妹妹嫁他。至於她呢？是十二分不願嫁他的；在壓迫之下，惟有背人飲泣，屢求自殺。我和她的感情是很好的，而且又是她的哥哥，那忍見死而不救呢？可惜我是一個小店員，進欵這樣的拮据，所謂有心而無力啊！現在正是走頭無路，唉！到了不得已之時，只有和我的妹妹，一同犧牲，而了我倆不幸的餘生。但在未死之前，敬以十二萬分的誠懇，來救先生，指點我們一條光明之道。若能抵抗繼母的陰謀，得到自由，那末我的妹妹得到救星，豈但我們感謝先生，就是已亡的母親，也不忘先生的大恩啊！先生，你是慈悲的，不會决絕將死的人底要求吧！！專此敬請選安。　陸少權謹上</p>
<p>編者按：賣買人口，根本不爲法律所允許。令妹與令繼母的身份，至多只可以算不養女。要是她有虐待行爲，令妹就可以主張脫離關係。現在她平日虐待了不算，還利令智昏，强迫她去嫁一個年齡不相當的男子，置她終身幸福於不顧，當然已經具備可以主張脫離母女關係的條件。不過辦理這種手續，要請律師，經法院的，未成年的令妹，與拮据萬分的你，對之恐不免均有難色。本埠有一個婦孺救濟會，專門以救濟厄運的婦孺爲工作：令妹何不前去請她們帮忙呢。她們那裏，辦這種事情，是辦慣了的，一定會有滿意的解决。此外她們那裏，還有很慈祥，很有經騐的導師，對於令妹以後的出路，也可有正確的指示。　　×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Expressed Fear That the Chahar Affair Would Generate Further Complications</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang dispatched Meng Xianzhang from Zhangjiakou to Beiping this morning to immediately meet with Huang Fu, proposing two solutions: Firstly, to request that Song Zheyuan return to Chahar to focus on administrative affairs; secondly, for Feng to handle the recovery of lost territories in Chahar. It is reported that Huang rejected these proposals. Yesterday, Song sent Qin Decun to meet with He, requesting the cancellation of his title as Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps, and requesting orders for the unit to return to Yangquan. It is reported that He expressed hope that this would not be necessary, fearing that the Chahar affair would generate further complications. As for Song's intention to go to Tianjin for medical treatment of his back ailment, He also requested that Song remain in Beiping temporarily to engage in mediation work. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng sent a letter to Huang Fu, stating that he would curtail military affairs after the completion of the anti-Japanese work and hoped that misunderstandings from all parties would be clarified. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Little Hope for Reconciliation in the Chahar Affair=</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Meng Xianzhang arrived in Beiping, there is still little hope for reconciliation in the Chahar affair. The units of Feng Qinzai and Pang Bingxun have begun transporting supplies to Chahar. Song met with He at 7 PM this evening, and Song's army is also preparing to return to Yangquan. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Meng Xianzhang stated that Feng is currently dedicated to recovering lost territories, with the majority of troops stationed in the Zhangbei area outside the pass, with very few troops near Zhangjiakou and no specific deployments. Since the successive recovery of Guyuan, Kangbao, and Baochang counties last month, the units of Ji Hongchang, Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and others, in collaboration with one division of Liu Guitang's forces, totaling over 20,000 men, have advanced towards Dolon Nor, currently less than 100 li away. The defending forces there consist of several hundred Japanese soldiers and two to three thousand rebel troops under Cui Xingwu. It is expected that the city will be captured within days. Rumors that the Communist Party held a cadre meeting in Zhangjiakou are inaccurate. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Troops of Pang and Feng Being Transported to Chahar=</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Following the order for Sun Dianying to be transferred to Qinghai for land reclamation, he is currently actively preparing, having concentrated his troops in the three locations of Shacheng, Chaigoubu, and Huai'an, awaiting the disbursement of departure fees from the Military Council before heading to Qinghai. The Beiping military authorities have ordered the three units of Pang Bingxun, Feng Qinzai, and He Sui to move towards the Ping-Sui Railway Line, Shacheng, and Huailai, to take over the defense areas of Sun Dianying. The troops of Pang and Feng have already started to transport supplies to Chahar. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The troops of Sun Dianying are scheduled to depart from Shacheng, north of Nankou, today for Qinghai. All parties are paying close attention to this matter. Assuming that Sun's troops actually depart, the defense areas they leave behind will be taken over by government troops. In this way, the stationed areas of government troops and Feng's army will be adjacent to each other, and Feng will have to make his attitude clear. According to reliable sources, a conflict between government troops and Feng's army is feared to be unavoidable. A peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation is now deemed hopeless, and with Feng adopting a provocative attitude, war is feared to be unavoidable. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Sun Dianying's Troops Preparing to Enter Qinghai=</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Council has issued the order for Sun Dianying's troops to depart for Qinghai. Currently, Sun's troops are concentrated in the three locations of Shacheng, Huailai, and Liugoubu, awaiting the allocation of vehicles on the Ping-Sui Railway and the disbursement of funds from the Military Council before implementing the departure. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Sun's troops stationed in Jincheng are preparing to depart for Qinghai. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Representative of Jin (Shanxi) Province, Yan, In Contact for Mediation=</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang is reportedly very cautious about coping strategies lately. Li Hongwen, the representative of Yan (Xishan) stationed in Beijing, has gone to Shanxi to meet with Yan on behalf of Wang (Jingwei) to mediate the Chahar affair. Li has already headed north yesterday and will arrive in Beiping tomorrow. After making contact with various parties in Beiping, he will go to Shanxi to meet with Yan to discuss mediating the Chahar affair. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhongying's Representative Visited Chiang, Expressing Obedience</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Ma Zhongying's representative, Zhao Fucheng, visited Chiang to report on the Xinjiang incidents and declared three points: 1) He definitely did not collude with the Communists; 2) He did not divide the region based on Han and non-Han ethnicities; 3) He only obeyed your authority to secure the border and pacify the region. Chiang gave him detailed instructions and wrote a personal letter for him to take to Xinjiang to convey everything to Ma. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) An 8th dispatch from Lanzhou states that Ma Zhongying suffered severe injuries and is recuperating in Turpan, four stations away from Hami. His troops have indeed retreated from Gucheng to Shiran River. Ma Zhongjie's cavalry suffered almost total losses. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yin Xue and Others Visited He and Huang to Report on the Dalian Negotiations</h3>
<p>(The recovery of the war zone and lost territories can proceed before the withdrawal of the puppet troops. The opening of the Beining Railway can be restored, at least reaching Qinhuangdao first.)</p>
<h3>(Consultations on Reception Procedures Begin)</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Beiping last night, Yin Tong immediately visited He and Huang to report on the results of the meeting with Japanese and puppet personnel in Dalian. They did not disperse until late at night. Yin told reporters that nearly one month had passed since the armistice agreement between China and Japan was established. Regarding the recovery of the war zone and lost territories, the implementation had not yet been possible due to the continued stay of the puppet troops in the Luodong area. Therefore, the three of us went to Dalian again to meet with Mr. Okamura and Mr. Kita from the Japanese side and Li Jichun from the puppet troops to discuss and resolve this matter. Our mission had two parts: 1) Resolve the puppet troops issue in Luodong, 2) Restore the traffic on the Beining Railway. Regarding the puppet troops issue, the puppet troops claimed to number 12,000, and only the best ones would be reorganized and transferred away from the railway lines, designated to be stationed around Fengrun and Luanxian. For the remaining puppet troops, our side would purchase their guns and horses and transport the puppet troops back to their original hometowns in Henan and Shandong to be disbanded. Li Jichun's title has not yet been determined, and he has been promised that his past actions will not be investigated. After this meeting, the War Zone Reception Committee can take over the lost territories before the withdrawal of the puppet troops. Regarding the opening of traffic on the Beining Railway, it has been agreed that traffic will be restored in the shortest possible time, restoring the situation before the Yuguan Incident. The detailed plan for the opening of traffic will be the responsibility of the Beining Railway. In summary, this trip to Dalian was based on the armistice agreement, with both sides meeting to convey their true intentions, and there was no formal signing of any kind. The so-called formal signing in Tanggu is not the case. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xue Zhiheng arrived in Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon and immediately visited He and Huang to report everything. This afternoon, He and Huang summoned Lei Shourong, Tao Shangming, Yin Tong, Xue Zhiheng, and others from the Reception Committee in Beiping to discuss the reception matter. It is reported that during the Dalian meeting, the Japanese side only recognized the puppet troops as their friendly troops, and Li Jichun claimed that he had no collusion with the Japanese army. He made many attacks on the former North China authorities, saying that their actions were popular rebellions forced by officials, and that he acted according to his conscience and did not do anything bad, even if he could not gain temporary understanding, he would be judged fairly in the future. It is hoped that the Beining Railway will be open to traffic by the 15th of this month. Even if there are obstacles in Yuguan, it can at least reach Qinhuangdao. The War Zone Reception Committee has decided to start discussing the implementation of the reception of the lost territories in Luodong tomorrow. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) If Xue Zhiheng, a member of the War Zone Reception Committee, can come to Tianjin from Beiping on the evening of the 9th, he will be able to hold a meeting at the Shaofu on the morning of the 10th to discuss the details of the reception. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Li Jichun went to Dalian to attend the meeting, he actually brought about eighty or ninety people, including the Director of the Department of Political Affairs, the Director of the Department of Military Affairs, and the Chief Consultant, to show off his power. Li's unit was organized into four brigades and seven detachments, with a total of about 6,000 actual firearms. As a result, a maximum of 4,000 people were incorporated, and they will be reorganized into two police teams, one reorganized by Li and the other by our side. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government has received a report on the methods for incorporating the puppet troops of Hebei, including: 1) The criteria for incorporation are limited to those who have firearms, with the number assumed to be 3,000, and at most not exceeding two-thirds of the quota; 2) The location of the troops after reorganization is temporarily set in three counties, such as XX; 3) Severance pay for the remaining personnel will be calculated by name, at two yuan per person; 4) The expenses after reorganization will be issued by the Beiping Military Council. However, Li Jichun's title has not been determined. It is said that he is intended to be appointed as the Luodong Garrison Commander, which will be implemented within the next week. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Headquarters of the Western Route Convened a Bandit Suppression Meeting</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The bandit suppression generals of the Jiangxi-Hubei border, Yue Sen and others, arrived in Changsha at 9:00 a.m. on the 9th. He Jian, the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route, and the military officers who arrived in Hunan earlier all welcomed them at the station. He hosted a banquet that evening to welcome Yue and others. The opening ceremony of the bandit suppression meeting will be held at the headquarters of the Western Route at 9:00 a.m. on the 10th, and it is scheduled to close in three days. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) A dispatch from Ganzhou states that the Southern Route Headquarters is located in Nanxiong and will be moved to Dayu if necessary. The Chief of Staff is Tan Sui. He Jian reported that the bandit suppression military conference will be held from the 10th, and the party and government rehabilitation conference will be held from the 12th. The adjutant division commanders and county magistrates of the Jiangxi Northwest garrison, except for the counties of Pingxiang, who went to Hunan via the Zhuping Road, are successively passing through the province to Hankou. Chairman Xiong (Shihui) sent a representative of the Land Council to attend. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Yuanchong took a transport plane to Hankou via Hunan on the 9th at the invitation of He Jian and will return to Beijing in about ten days. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gong Bicheng and Others Requested Instructions on Post-Incident Measures in Xinjiang Province</h3>
<p>Gong and others are scheduled to fly to Xinjiang tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Huang Musong Will Return to Beijing Soon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gong Bicheng, a special commissioner of Party affairs in Xinjiang Province, and others have been requesting instructions from the Central Government and the Executive Yuan for several days to deal with the Xinjiang incident and post-incident measures. They are scheduled to fly to Xinjiang on the 11th. Huang Musong will return to Beijing after meeting with Gong in Xinjiang. The office of the Appeasement Commissioner's Office will also be abolished. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Naval Officers of Northeast Expressed Willingness to Advance and Retreat Together With Shen Honglie</h3>
<p>A telegram led by Xie Gangzhe was sent to Chiang and He.</p>
<h3>"We cannot bear to see the affairs of our army go astray and delay the local affairs."</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Following the naval incident in the Northeast, the Central Government has ordered the merging under the control of the Ministry of the Navy. The selection of the commander has not yet been determined. On the 7th, all the officers of the Northeast Navy, led by Chief of Staff Xie Gangzhe, telegraphed Chiang and He, saying: "Recently, we read that the Central Committee decided that Huai Shen would resign from the post of Naval Commander and hand over the remaining ships to the Ministry of the Navy. The State Council has issued the order. The reorganization of the Ministry of the Navy is a small matter, and the local governance is a major matter. Now that Shen no longer handles naval affairs, he has also decided to resign from the post of Mayor. Gangzhe and others are determined to advance and retreat together and will never be attached to their positions. However, Qingdao is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the coastal areas are important. Gangzhe and others cannot bear to see the affairs of our army go astray and delay the local affairs. Your Excellency has always been deeply concerned about Shen and the Navy over the years, so we dare to risk disobedience and present our words at the cost of ten thousand deaths, hoping that you will review and instruct us so that we have something to follow." (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zeng Yiding came to Beiping yesterday to visit He and report on the true circumstances of the Bohai Fleet incident. Today, he went to Tianjin again. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Bohai Fleet has decided to temporarily retain its original military quota and official positions due to the escape of the three Haiqi ships. After Shen Honglie resigned, the position of Fleet Commander has not yet been determined, and one of Zeng Yiding, Liu Tianfu, Ling Xiao, and Xie Gangzhe will be selected for appointment. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources, although the three ships heading south from Dagukou on the 6th, have already arrived in Qingdao yesterday. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Government Held a Memorial for the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial for the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking on the morning of the 9th. Ye Chucang, He Yaozu, Zheng Zhannan, Gu Zhenggang, Li Zonghuang, and over 300 other officials and representatives from various agencies attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. After the music was played and the ceremony began, He Yaozu was temporarily promoted to report due to Zhu Peide's leave. He briefly stated that as we commemorate the oath-taking today, we should naturally express our respect for the martyrs who died for the cause and the hardworking leaders, but we must not forget the meaning of the Northern Expedition. The Northern Expedition was not a civil war, but a liberation effort to seek national freedom and national independence. Now, we should step up the second step of national construction and work hard according to the eight words of "strengthening national power to seek self-reliance." We should also unite as a country and move towards this goal, so that we can resolve the crisis, complete the liberation work, and be worthy of the martyrs who died for the cause. This kind of commemoration of the oath-taking is meaningful. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial for the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking at 9:00 a.m. on the 9th. Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Zhizhong, Ye Chucang, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and hundreds of other officials attended. Lin Sen presided over the ceremony, led the greetings, and delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Premier had planned the Northern Expedition many times during his lifetime and had put in a lot of effort. Subsequently, revolutionary soldiers continued to work hard, creating today's unification, which is the greatest glory for our party. Today, the national crisis is deepening, with internal and external troubles pressing on each other. It is hoped that the military will adhere to the spirit of the Northern Expedition, complete the work of first securing the interior and then repelling foreign enemies, so that the principles of our party can be developed and promoted. Ye Chucang then gave a speech, saying that he had two feelings about commemorating the oath-taking today: 1) The spirit of the Premier's efforts in planning the Northern Expedition is unmatched by anyone; 2) Before the Northern Expedition, the Premier first worked hard to eliminate the reactionary elements in Guangdong and laid the foundation before the Northern Expedition. At that time, public opinion supported him. Now, the Central Government is making every effort to suppress the Red bandits, which is also based on this principle. We must first secure the interior and then repel foreign enemies, but public opinion does not understand this point and should be corrected. After the speech, the meeting was adjourned. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing Municipal Party Department convened a memorial meeting for the seventh anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking on the morning of the 9th. All the staff of the Municipal Party Committee and more than 200 representatives from all walks of life attended. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Provincial Party Department convened a memorial meeting for the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking on the morning of the 9th. Gan Yun presided over the meeting, and Chen Zhenwei and others gave speeches. More than 500 people attended. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Anqing) The Provincial Rectification Committee convened a memorial for the seventh anniversary of the Northern Expedition at 9:00 a.m. on the 9th. Because it was a weekday, all sectors did not take a holiday. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Rampant in Northern Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chiang Ordered Liu Xiang to Suppress Them Early</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Telegraphed That He Would Immediately Send Troops to Suppress Bandits and Stop the Chaos</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Sichuan representative stated that the Communist bandits in northern Sichuan are rampant, and the areas along Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong have long been occupied by bandits. Recently, they have continued to develop and penetrate into rural areas, and have taken advantage of the peasant resistance against taxes in southern Sichuan to incite riots. If the generals in central Sichuan still do not repent and only engage in internal strife, the future of Sichuan will be unimaginable. Liu Xiang's three-and-a-half-year plan for reorganizing Sichuan included: the first stage, unifying the Sichuan army; the second stage, suppressing the Communist bandits in Sichuan; and the third stage, planning to rectify the political and financial affairs of Sichuan Province. He telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek to review the plan, and Chiang replied, elaborating on the crisis of the Communist bandits and the current environment of our country, weighing the urgency and importance, and that the Communist bandits should be suppressed first to restore the rural economy, and then the military should be unified. He has obtained Liu Xiang's consent and appointed Liu as the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression on the previous day. From now on, if Liu can sincerely follow the instructions of the Central Government and work with the generals of Sichuan Province to suppress the bandits, then those with ambitions will have no opportunity to take advantage of. Otherwise, not only will the people of Sichuan be plunged into misery again, but the Kang-Tibet disputes will also take the opportunity to erupt, increasing the government's concerns about the West. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression, Liu Xiang, sent a telegram to the Central Party Department, Chairman Lin (Sen), President Wang (Jingwei), and Chairman Chiang (Kai-shek) from the Longchang Camp on the 6th, stating that he would immediately send troops to suppress the Red bandits with some of the forces, and send some forces west to stop the dispute between Liu and Deng, in order to eliminate the internal chaos and suppress the Red bandits in the shortest possible time, so as to relieve the Central Government's concerns about the West and alleviate the suffering of the Sichuan people. The original text is as follows: "The Red disaster in northern Sichuan has become a prairie fire. Cangxi, Guangyuan, and Bazhong have successively reported their impending fall. The whole of Sichuan is shaken, and the disaster of Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan, and Hubei is imminent. Running around and calling for help is urgent. Xiang has repeatedly received your telegrams, ordering him to prepare a plan for suppressing the bandits. Local feelings and responsibilities cannot be delayed. Unfortunately, the war between Liu and Deng happened to break out. At that time, the war was linked and the whole territory was rioting. Originally, I wanted to pacify the internal strife first, and then gather all the forces of Sichuan to clear the banditry, but I did not expect that the combatants would fight on their own, not listening to the containment, and the words of Xiaoyin were still difficult to persuade, causing the Red disaster to burn like a fire, and the burning became more and more urgent, and disasters became more difficult to deal with. After investigation, the Red bandits only invaded Tongnan when they first sneaked into Sichuan, and Tian's army was conquered, and then recovered. Only when the war in western Sichuan started, Tian's troops were transferred to prepare for defense, which allowed the remaining ashes to rekindle the fierce flames. Now the internal strife has not subsided, and the banditry has deepened. This is truly a critical moment of life and death. Xiang has a responsibility to rehabilitate the aftermath and has no way to stop the chaos. Considering the heavy trust of the central government and the expectations of the Sichuan people, I have been thinking day and night and planning as much as possible, and have decided to do my best, send troops immediately, and work with the Tian, Yang, and Liu armies to jointly suppress the Red bandits, and send some troops to the west to stop the dispute between Liu and Deng, in order to eliminate the internal chaos in the shortest possible time to prevent the common purpose of suppressing the bandits. It is hoped that this will turn the crisis into peace, relieve the central government's concerns about the West, and alleviate the suffering of the Sichuan people. Urgent words are presented, and I respectfully ask for your scrutiny and approval, etc." Liu Xiang, kowtowing fish (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Sichuan War on the Nation's Future is Clear</h3>
<p>The national crisis is so severe, yet the conflict between Deng and Liu in Sichuan has not abated. The people of the whole country are increasingly calling for an end to the war, but they are escalating it further, and the ravages of war are becoming more intense. Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," could be self-sufficient even with its access to the outside world closed off, yet its fields are disturbed, and its people cannot find a single day of peace. Who is to blame for this? These warlords are people too. Their reason for fighting tooth and nail is simply to expand their territory. Do they not realize that the land will be scorched and the people will become dried-up fish? Where will they then find support? Moreover, this kind of action is not only enough to disrupt the security of Sichuan Province, but the entire country will also be affected. Yet, they still have no remorse and completely disregard the current crisis facing the nation and its people. This is truly strange. There are several ways in which the Sichuan affair can impact China's future:</p>
<p>Firstly, the Sichuan warlords are accustomed to playing political games, only seeking to seize power and consolidate their positions. They have absolutely no sense of integrity. They treat the people under their military rule like cattle and horses, only knowing how to exploit them at will. Towards the central government, they feign respect and support, but in reality, they treat orders like toys.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they send representatives everywhere to make connections. What is their intention? On the one hand, they are doing their utmost to expand their military, which requires vast expenses and overlapping taxes. Regarding land taxes, what was once collected annually is now collected monthly. As for additional taxes, in addition to the Likin tax and unified tax, there are patriotic donations, merchant protection bureaus, and anti-Japanese taxes. Other levies extend to vegetables, and even the smallest violations are punished harshly. As a result, farmers cannot live peacefully in the fields, and merchants cannot live peacefully in the markets. The 70 million people of Sichuan Province are mostly at a loss as to what to do. Thus, resistance to taxes and military uprisings have sprung up and spread throughout southwestern Sichuan within days.</p>
<p>Secondly, the people of Sichuan cannot bear the warlords' exploitation. Even self-sufficient farmers with only a few acres of meager land are not only unable to support themselves but also unable to pay taxes. The act of abandoning land and fleeing famine is gradually reappearing in Sichuan. As a result, the Communists, with their thousands of defeated and starving troops, have infiltrated northern Sichuan. In the wealthy and prosperous Sichuan, there was originally no room for them to gain a foothold. Their ability to capture cities and towns and run rampant for a time is not due to the strength of the Communists, but rather to the fact that internal strife in Sichuan has deepened popular resentment, providing them with an opportunity to exploit. This is a case of "driving fish into the deep and birds into the forest." If Sichuan does not completely reverse its previous actions in the future, the spread of communist disasters in Sichuan will be a cause for great concern.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Sichuan was originally a land surrounded by mountains, and the obstructed transportation has made it even more isolated. For the past twenty-two years, shutting the door and killing each other had little impact on the overall situation. However, times have changed. The four northeastern provinces have already become the outer territories of the Japanese Empire, and our country's market is becoming increasingly smaller. The surrounding strong neighbors are all eager to get a share of the pie. The situation in Tibet currently appears to be easing, but it is still serious. Among the thirty-odd counties in the entire Xikang Province, only Kangding and a dozen other counties are still in our hands. The rest, such as Jiangda and Lhari, have long been occupied by the Tibetan army. Kangping and Ningjing are also frequently unstable. If the internal strife in Sichuan does not cease, the Kang-Tibetan issue will inevitably expand. Moreover, the relationship between the Hui and Han people has been friendly for a long time, but the Xinjiang issue is still prone to disputes and still relies on a crisis. Another form of aggression is being actively brewing. Even if the Hui and Tibetan people are wholeheartedly inclined towards the interior, what can be done about those who constantly sow discord and never cease their schemes? In the future, Sichuan will be the first to feel the serious impact of this situation.</p>
<p>In summary, any one of these three points is enough to harm the country. How much more so when Sichuan today is fully equipped with all of them? The people harbor resentment internally, and powerful enemies surround us externally. The fields are not cultivated, and the people have nowhere to die. How can we improve Sichuan's future and secure our borders? The central government is now paying attention to the western frontier and considering the Sichuan administration. Positive construction may not be easy to implement in the short term, but negatively stopping the warlords from fighting each other cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3>Japan's Successful Aggression</h3>
<h3>Also Uses Friendship to Bait Us</h3>
<p>Japan Re-examines its Policy Toward China</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government is liquidating its past diplomatic policy of following Europe and the United States, shifting its foundation to the Far East, especially re-examining its policy toward China, and plans to establish a firm and unwavering policy toward China. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is generally dealing with the complex Chinese political situation with the following intentions: Chinese diplomacy has always been based on schemes and tactics, adopting a reliance on other countries. Therefore, when the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents occurred, they appealed to the League of Nations or shook hands with Soviet Russia, attempting to pressure Japan. However, these plans all failed. Recently, they seem to have gradually realized that Europe and the United States cannot be relied upon. When the Kwantung Army crossed the Great Wall and attacked the plains of northern China, Chiang Kai-shek sent He Yingqin and Huang Fu to Peiping, violating his previous declarations, and established the North China Ceasefire Negotiation through direct negotiations. The order in North China is stable, and China especially feels the necessity of cooperating with Japan to deal with the situation. This change in China's attitude is a rare phenomenon. Among the important figures in the Nanjing government, there are also those who strongly advocate Sino-Japanese cooperation and changing their diplomatic policy toward Japan. Although there is now an anti-Japanese faction centered on Song Ziwen, Chiang Kai-shek will never participate in any faction. This matter is especially noteworthy in Japan. Japan's diplomatic policy toward China, of course, if China still does not change its anti-Japanese and humiliating attitude, it will take decisive measures. Otherwise, if the Chinese government changes its previous attitude toward Japan, and the situation further extends a pro-Japanese hand, it will actively assist the National Government as a legitimate negotiating partner.

<h3>The Six-Nation Currency Alliance is Established to Maintain the European Gold Standard</h3>
<p>France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland Unite as One</p>
<p>It is expected that the United States will also stabilize the dollar</p>
<p>(Paris) The six countries in continental Europe, which possess 48% of the world's gold, will act as a unit in the struggle to maintain the gold standard in the future. Leaders of the central banks of France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland decided at a meeting here today that the six banks would be linked together to prevent further fluctuations in exchange rates. No bank among the six will take any action that affects other countries' currencies without first consulting the other banks. This meeting was secretly convened, and the President of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr. Frere, was also present. In addition, they also agreed to immediately implement technical measures to prevent fluctuations in exchange rates. However, the communique issued after the meeting did not detail the plans adopted. It is currently believed that the exchange rate stabilization funds remaining in France and other gold standard countries, although not large, will not be exhausted as quickly as rumored.</p>
<p>It is reported that the meeting of bankers from gold standard countries was in response to the United States' refusal to stabilize exchange rates. It is heard that these bankers have received reports that only farmers and some manufacturers in the United States are pleased with the devaluation of the gold dollar, while other sectors are not enthusiastic about it. The general opinion here is that the gold bloc organized today can not only maintain the European gold standard when the United States adopts a policy of not preventing the gold dollar from fluctuating but can also consolidate the position of the six countries' currencies.</p>
<p>Financial circles here also expect the formation of the gold bloc to become a disruptive factor in the American market. According to news from New York, the prices of all securities in that city showed signs of instability due to this move by Europe. It is also heard here that there are growing calls in Wall Street to stabilize the US dollar and restore the gold standard. Bankers with customers engaged in international trade are said to be worried about the devaluation of the US dollar. Therefore, several British bankers have predicted that the United States will soon begin to gradually re-stabilize the gold dollar. It is also heard that the outflow of American capital abroad in recent weeks has been considerable, which is also a factor that can promote the stabilization of the US dollar. However, the full impact of this decision by European bankers will not be fully apparent until the first management plan is implemented. The impact on the US securities market today is mostly due to psychological factors and the uncertainty of the future situation. (8th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Today, the Minister of Finance of Brussels, Mr. Jaspar, gave a broadcast speech, saying that Belgium has decided to maintain the gold standard. According to him, there are currently 13,500,000,000 francs in cash reserves here. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Gold Bloc's Plan</h3>
<p>Preventing Further Fluctuations in Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Not Attacking the British Pound or the US Dollar</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, a meeting of national bankers was held, and the strategic plan to maintain the gold standard was fully agreed upon. A communique was issued after the meeting, stating that as a result of the exchange of views, they had fully agreed on how to give full and practical effect to the gold standard governments' declarations to fully maintain the current gold standard rates. The central banks of the countries attending the meeting will immediately complete the technical arrangements for all the details that have been agreed upon.</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by Mr. Moret, the Governor of the Central Bank of France, and attended by representatives from the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other seven countries, as well as Mr. Frere, the President of the Bank for International Settlements. Mr. Moret later said that the banks attending the meeting hold 40% of the world's total reserves. The gold bloc's plan to maintain its currencies is prepared and will be implemented when the financial markets open on Monday.</p>
<p>Although the bankers' decision was said to be unanimous, the technical methods they will use are still kept secret. The communique did not state that the bankers did not need their governments to grant them authority. In fact, they are only carrying out the measures that their governments have already agreed upon. They will now sign a cooperation agreement and record their governments' decisions. Two suggestions were put forward at the meeting: one was to establish a foreign exchange combination group, and the other was to manage foreign exchange operations. Foreign currencies can only be purchased from central banks. It is heard that gold countries have established a common fund, which will be used to maintain market conditions in the event of speculation threatening gold currencies.</p>
<p>Gold countries have stated that this move is not a declaration of war on currencies that have abandoned the gold standard but is only fighting against speculation. The six gold countries have repeatedly stated that they intend to maintain the free use of the gold standard in their countries within the scope of the existing gold parities and existing currency laws. The presence of Mr. Frere, an American and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at the gold countries' meeting is of twofold importance: firstly, because the Bank for International Settlements will serve as the liaison and intelligence agency for the gold countries' central banks, and secondly, because the bank's participation can ensure that the United Kingdom and the United States know that the gold countries do not intend to attack the British pound or the US dollar.

<p>European Modern Civilization</p>
<h3>Originated from Currency Alliances</h3>
<p>(Paris) The famous French expert Faucher wrote an article in the political weekly "Europa," stating that the modern civilization of Europe originated from currency alliances. The currency alliance of the German states from 1857 to 1871 laid the foundation for the unification of Germany. Currency alliances also existed between the Scandinavian countries and the Latin countries such as France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, and Greece. The latter alliance lasted from 1865 to 1920, resulting in cultural and political friendship between these countries. Why not imitate this today? Currency alliances can be started on a small scale and then gradually extended to other countries. In this way, the long-awaited European agreement will eventually be realized.

<h3>The Optimism of the US Representative</h3>
<p>Hull Explains the Hope for the Success of the Conference</p>
<p>(London) The US Chief Delegate Hull stated today that the US President has not given new instructions to the US delegation. The President's telegram currently being studied by the US representatives only explains the previously stated opinions and mainly guides the work of the representatives. Hull also explained the hope for the success of the conference, saying that he is confident that the representatives of all countries will warmly support the resolution of the various issues listed in the trial program of discussion, and he expects that this discussion will be beneficial and can achieve results. He also urged all countries to unite and work together again to make the conference a success. Although the new agenda of the economic conference still needs to be finally decided by the Steering Committee, it is expected that those that have already been agreed upon by the various subcommittees can be approved and continue to work on Monday. (8th, Republic of China Telegram)</p>
<p>Steering Committee</p>
<h3>The Situation Remains Chaotic</h3>
<p>Secret Talks Between Britain and France</p>
<p>(London) The main activity of the conference this week is to campaign for votes that are not guaranteed when the Steering Committee meets on Monday. It is generally expected that there will be a debate on what can be discussed within the scope of currency. It was learned today that the British and French delegations had held private talks. The nature of these talks is unknown, leading to much speculation. At the same time, there is another important development: US Secretary of State Hull issued an article today after communicating with President Roosevelt, reiterating his proposal at the previous meeting of the Steering Committee that the work of the conference should continue to proceed and listing the matters that the United States believes can be discussed, such as prices, lending policies, private and foreign debts, producer agreements, and prohibiting trade restrictions and retaliation that could lead to war. The general public believes that Hull's remarks this time have not greatly changed his previous opinions expressed at the meeting of the Steering Committee. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>The US Dollar Plummets</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants are Severely Hit</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese-US exchange rate is approaching 30 US dollars, but the Yokohama Specie Bank often buys export bills at high prices in the market, so most foreign currencies are concentrated in the Yokohama Specie Bank. In particular, due to the instability of the US dollar, the Yokohama Specie Bank is now exchanging gold pounds or other currencies, so the impact of the US dollar is relatively small, but it is still inevitable that it will suffer considerable pain. Also, on the trade side, due to the reaction of the plummeting US dollar, the Japanese currency has become expensive. If this continues, Japan will enter a period of excess imports, and the inflation of currency will soon be realized, so when it will fall back, it is still unpredictable, and everyone is on guard against this reaction.

<h3>US Unifies Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Farmers Unwilling to Destroy Their Cotton Seedlings</p>
<p>Government Plan Effectively Stalled</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government's efforts to unify the textile industry to make its production meet the needs of the domestic market are effectively stalled today, because manufacturers believe that if the surplus cotton this year increases even more than last year, the government's textile plan will be greatly hampered, so many are watching and waiting for the Ministry of Agriculture to announce the results of the cotton elimination. According to today's announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture, the number of acres of cotton planted in the South this year is approximately 40,798,000 acres, which is a considerable increase compared to last year's 36,542,000 acres. After hearing about the government's agricultural and price increase plan, farmers expected to get a good price for cotton this fall and competed to plant it. Although the results of the cotton elimination campaign have not been announced, it is faintly heard that farmers all want others to reduce the number of acres, but are unwilling to destroy their own cotton fields, preferring to give up the subsidies and rent that can be obtained immediately rather than sacrifice the cotton seedlings that have already been planted. Therefore, the Minister of Agriculture gave another radio broadcast speech today, urging farmers to cooperate with the government and quickly eliminate a portion of the cotton seedlings, saying that this move will benefit the entire country, and farmers who are willing to help the government's acreage reduction plan will immediately receive rewards. Today, the price of cotton has fallen slightly after hearing the Ministry of Agriculture's acreage report. (8th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>Germany and the Roman Curia sign a Political-Religious Separation Treaty</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Event in European History</p>
<p>Reuters, Vatican City, 8th - German Deputy Chancellor von Papen and Curia Secretary of State Pacelli signed the first letter of the agreement between Germany and the Curia today, which stipulates the status of Catholics in Germany. This is an unprecedented event in history. It is heard that the Curia has agreed to allow Catholic priests and Catholic organizations to completely separate from politics.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 8th - After receiving the news of the signing of the agreement between the German government and the Curia, Hitler ordered the cancellation of the order to dissolve Catholic organizations and banned all plans to oppose Catholic teachers and followers. Hitler claimed that the signing of the agreement is enough to guarantee the unconditional support of the National Socialist government by Germans and Catholics. Regarding this matter, Deputy Chancellor von Papen said that after the division of powers between politics and religion, there will never be a dispute between politics and religion in Germany. Havas, Vatican City, 8th - Curia Prime Minister Cardinal Pacelli initialed a religious treaty with German Deputy Chancellor von Papen at nearly 6:00 p.m. After receiving the news, Hitler expressed his satisfaction by telephone. Von Papen issued a statement saying, "Previously, religious treaties were signed separately by the various states in the federation and the Curia. This is the first time that a religious treaty has been signed directly by the central government. I firmly believe that this treaty has great value for the Curia's missionary work and can also maintain internal peace in the German nation and the National Socialist state." Von Papen will return to Berlin tonight and come to Rome again in about ten days to hold the signing.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 8th - The religious treaty signed between the Curia and Germany has been initialed. According to reports, the first negotiation on this matter began on July 3, when the draft was formulated and sent to Berlin. The German government made many amendments to this draft and continued to negotiate. The last negotiation was conducted by Curia Prime Minister Cardinal Pacelli and German Deputy Chancellor von Papen. The treaty initialed today is the result of this negotiation. The religious treaty contains 32 articles, and its spirit is mostly taken from the Lateran Treaty signed between Italy and the Curia. According to the newly concluded treaty, Catholics should abandon the right to form political associations, and other religious groups will be subject to state supervision. The exchange of property by clergy is recognized by the state, and the church enjoys some freedom in education. After the establishment of this religious treaty, all previous treaties separately concluded between Bavaria, Prussia, Baden, and the Curia will be invalidated. The representatives of Germany, Bavaria, and Prussia to the Curia will now be merged into one representative, and the current German Ambassador to the Curia, Bell, will preside.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 9th - The religious treaty concluded between Germany and the Roman Curia has been initialed. After receiving the news of the initialing, Premier Hitler issued an order to grant a special amnesty to Catholic clergy who had been arrested for political crimes, and Catholic organizations without political nature that had been sealed off were also allowed to be unsealed. Premier Hitler also expressed his hope in the last paragraph of the order, saying that a similar agreement could soon be concluded between the Protestant Church and the German state.</p>
<p>The Question of Austro-Hungarian Unification</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Arrives in Vienna</h3>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 8th - Hungarian Prime Minister Dr. Gömbös accepted the invitation of Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss and formally visited Vienna. Hungarian figures believe that Prime Minister Dr. Gömbös's trip to Vienna will not disrupt the friendly relations between Hungary and Germany, because Hungary does not want to interfere in the conflict between Austria and Germany, and Mr. Gömbös's trip is only for the purpose of studying the economic problems between Hungary and Austria. In addition, Austrian officials specifically stated that the two prime ministers will not discuss tariff or political union, nor will they discuss the issue of restoration. In short, all the things that newspapers have speculated on are not what the two authorities intend to discuss. The only things that Mr. Gömbös and the Austrian Prime Minister want to talk about are the discoveries of scientists in Hungary and Austria.</p>
<h3>The Bee of the Primordial Era</h3>
<p>(Reuters Cologne Dispatch) Mr. Staesz, a teacher in Cologne, has been excavating in the tertiary strata of the Rhine-Lahn region near Rot for the past few years, seeking fossils of flora and fauna. Recently, he discovered an object that is completely like a bee, and its physical development is only slightly different from that of today's honeybees. Mr. Staesz has announced this discovery to the scientific community, and so far, it seems that no one has been able to challenge it. This primordial bee has been included in Mr. Staesz's exhibition of fossil finds. If it is indeed a bee, then this insect existed as early as 90 million years ago.</p>
<p>various impacts arising from the implementation of the current commercial treaty. Furthermore, Premier Kung's recent visit to Berlin has created a negative impression in Vienna. The Hungarian Premier's official visit to Dollfuss this time may be intended to dispel misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 8th. In the Hungarian capital, someone sought the opinion of Foreign Minister Ganya on the Austro-Hungarian customs union issue. Ganya replied that this issue, along with several other issues, is under the jurisdiction of the Austro-Hungarian Permanent Joint Committee established in Vienna, with the intention of making the economic relationship between the two countries closer and expanding its scope.</p>
<p>Litvinov Actively</p>
<h3>Promoting Amity Between Russia and France</h3>
<p>International Conferences Have Entered a State of Semi-Annihilation</p>
<p>TASS, Paris, 8th. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov issued a statement to the press here, stating that the Soviet Union is currently working to promote amity with France. Litvinov said that the interests of the Soviet Union do not conflict with the interests of France in any aspect of the world, and that there are no obstacles to further political and even economic coordination between the two countries. Litvinov reiterated that peace is the cornerstone of Soviet foreign policy. "Since the Soviet Union has no purpose or desire to acquire new territories, and regards the conquest of other nations as a violation of its fundamental principles, it will inevitably gain nothing from war. This alone is sufficient to explain why the Soviet Union avoids war and why it always welcomes and supports any actions of other countries that are in line with the Soviet Union's peaceful policy." He continued, "France is showing a deeper understanding of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. The expression of this deeper understanding is the Franco-Russian non-aggression pact and France's sympathetic attitude towards the steps taken by the Soviet Union to consolidate peaceful relations among its neighbors." Litvinov continued, saying that it is doubtful whether good results can be expected from the existing international conferences (some of which have entered a state of semi-annihilation). He said that if hope in this regard is lost, then we should devote greater efforts to negotiations between countries that are concerned with maintaining peace and avoiding international conflicts of an interventionist nature. He further stated that the Soviet Union's emphasis on political blocs is not to counter aggression from Party A against Party B. "What we wish to maintain is the best relationship with countries whose interests are the same as ours and do not attempt to harm our welfare."</p>

<h3>Display of Rare Treasures</h3>
<p>Large Diamond Worth 500,000 Gold Dollars</p>
<p>(Reuters Chicago Dispatch) The famous Great Nazak Diamond, which was originally the brilliant eye of an Indian idol when first seen by white men, will now be displayed at the World's Fair here. According to fair officials, the stone is worth 500,000 gold dollars. In the 18th century, it was taken from the Sakhsival Temple in India and later brought to London. It weighs 78 and five-eighths carats and will now be the main item in the display of treasures and is protected with extreme care. The stone is placed in a bulletproof safe, the front of which can be opened, and the back has a thick pad. The stone is embedded on the pad. Outside the safe is a shatterproof glass cabinet, guarded by guards wearing weapons and gas masks. The safe is equipped with tear gas and an "electric eye" protection mechanism. If someone crosses the beam of invisible light, an alarm bell will ring loudly, and the glass cabinet also has a mechanism. If someone strikes it, the stone will automatically fall into the safe, releasing tear gas.</p>
<p>(Expenditure) 280 million for improvement of military equipment, 180 million for the Manchurian Incident, 150 million for temporary relief, 70 million for exchange losses, and over 100 million for other new requests, plus a basic budget of 1.44 billion, totaling 2.22 billion yen. (2) (Revenue) Although Finance Minister Takahashi's intentions have not changed, tax revenues and industrial promotion revenues have recently improved. Therefore, recurring revenues will increase by 40 million yen, and revenue will be 1.23 billion, with the difference of 990 million between expenditure and revenue being supplemented by public debt.</p>

<h3>Political Party Coalition Movement</h3>

<p>Nichi-Ren, Tokyo, 9th. Since the 515 Incident, various parties have considered countermeasures. Recently, various parties have the opinion of forming a political party coalition, that is, uniting various parties to revive party politics, take charge of the cabinet, and implement national policies on diplomacy and national defense. Currently, the most active person in promoting this political party coalition movement is Koizumi Sakutaro, the "comet" of the political world. There are also many who resonate with this idea within both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, so this movement is gradually gaining momentum.</p>

<h3>One Aspect of Japan's Economic Invasion of the Northeast (Changchun Dispatch)</h3>
<p>= Completion of the Dunhua-Tumen Road</p>
<p>= Allocation of Various Shipping Lines =</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of the three eastern provinces can be considered to have reached its peak militarily. Even though there are still many volunteer soldiers who, after countless bitter battles and countless tragic defeats, continue to maintain the spirit of national resistance, after defeat, they fight again. However, at present, they can no longer engage in direct confrontation with the opposing side, and can only launch occasional attacks from the side. Therefore, Japan can take the time to engage in economic invasion, a war without bloodshed. This is the construction of the railway from Dunhua to the Tumen River bank. Originally, this railway was the Jilin-Huining Road, which had not been completely resolved for a long time. After the Japanese army seized Jilin, it started construction without any doubt. Work that would normally take five years to complete was completed in just over a year. Judging from the railway itself, it is naturally not well-built. The roadbed is not solid, and the sleepers are not evenly spaced, so there is often a risk of derailment. The time the reporter took the train, an American-made locomotive pulled ten freight cars carrying 30 French tons, and two third-class passenger cars. Among these passengers, there were twelve of us Chinese, eighteen Korean workers and farmers, and the rest were seven or eight Japanese people managing the railway. They all carried pistols, and the guard was extremely strict. Moreover, the forests within about 200 meters of the railway line were completely cut down, fully revealing a gloomy atmosphere of killing. This is because the road is not well-built, especially in the Laotougou and Habaling areas, which are prone to accidents. The area near Laoye Ridge near Jilin is also not very peaceful.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also because the Japanese feel very棘手about the volunteer army's resistance. A few days ago, there was a train robbery, in which fifteen Japanese were killed and two were taken away. It is still unknown what happened to them. Therefore, now there is a pilot train in front of its passenger and freight trains, equipped with iron armor, carrying small cannons, machine guns, rifles, and pistols for protection. The train travels at a maximum speed of no more than 15 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>If the train is going so slow, and there isn't much cargo either, what is the meaning of accelerating the construction of this road? According to our view under the oppression of force, the view based on what we have seen and heard is:</p>
<p>First, it is for military reasons. In the eyes of the Japanese militarists, the biggest and most powerful enemy on the mainland is Soviet Russia. They want to firmly occupy Manchuria, restrict the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and exceed the mobilization rate of the Soviet army. Having only the South Manchurian Railway is not enough, so they quickly completed the Jilin-Huining Road. If an incident occurs between Japan and the Soviet Union, they can block Manchuria from the west and seize Vladivostok from the east from the Jilin-Huining Road.</p>
<p>Second, economically, the Jilin-Huining Road is a parallel line to the eastern part of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Harbin-Binjiang Road is a parallel line to the southern part of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In the future, when the railway from Yanji to Sanxing is completed, the Chinese Eastern Railway will be completely surrounded, losing its original economic value.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese side is now vigorously developing maritime transportation. Although Rajin Port has not been successfully built, "Chongjin" is usable. Therefore, Japanese shipping companies are all accepting government assistance to open new shipping routes. The main ships and companies are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Osaka Shosen Kaisha has assigned the Guizhou Maru and Wuchang Maru to make weekly circuits between Osaka, Kobe, Moji, and North Korean ports.</p>
<p>(2) Kita Nippon Kisen Co., Ltd., under the order of the Ministry of Communications, has assigned the Manchuria Maru to sail three times a month between Tsuruga and North Korean ports. At the same time, the Amakusa Maru, which sails between Tsuruga and Vladivostok, also calls at North Korean ports.</p>
<p>(3) Chosen Yusen Co., Ltd., under the order of the Governor-General of Korea, has assigned the Changbaishan Maru to sail twice a month between Cheongjin and Tsuruga.</p>
<p>(4) Hokuriku Kisen Co., Ltd., under the order of the Ministry of Communications, has assigned the Kita Yu Maru and Kita Naru Maru to sail between North Korean ports, Vladivostok, and Fushiki.</p>
<p>(5) Shimatani Kisen Co., Ltd., under the order of the Governor-General of Korea, has assigned the Senkai Maru to sail three times a month between North Korean ports and Hokkaido ports.</p>
<p>Just from the allocation of these ships and the rapid completion of the railway, one can see Japan's plan to blockade Vladivostok and cut off the Chinese Eastern Railway from both land and sea. Whether this plan can be fully realized depends on our Chinese countermeasures and the Soviet Union's strategies. (July 1)</p>
<h3>The Story of the Arrest of the Traitorous Leader Hao Peng</h3>
<p>‖ Escorted to the Military Department by Accomplices in the Early Morning</p>
<p>The Tianjin Authorities Telegraphed Beijing for Instructions on Handling</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul Made Absurd Protests‖</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Hao Peng, who was in charge of the plainclothes team during the Tianjin Incident a month ago and claimed to be the Commander-in-Chief of the North China People's Self-Defense Army, was arrested yesterday morning by his adjutant Yuan and two others due to uneven distribution of spoils, which led to internal strife. Hao was driven out of the Japanese Concession by car and sent to the First Army Corps Headquarters, where he is currently being interrogated. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Uneven Distribution of Funds Leads to Hatred Among Accomplices)</p>
<p>The plainclothes team's disruption failed, and after the Tanggu Truce was concluded, they knew that nothing could be done. They left Tianjin for Dalian one after another. Most of the plainclothes team members also boarded Japanese ships and were sent to Qinhuangdao for resettlement. Although the central and provincial governments issued clear arrest warrants for several of their leaders, they could not be arrested because they resided in the concessions. After Bai Jianwu and others left Tianjin, Hao Peng remained defiantly in Tianjin and appointed Zhang Zizhou and others to military positions in Baodi, and had already appointed military officers in Yutian, recruiting soldiers and plotting rebellion. It was because he was greedy for money and did not distribute funds evenly with his accomplices, which led Yuan and others to hold hatred in their hearts and send Hao to the First Army Corps Headquarters yesterday morning. Previously, Hao had obtained a lot of money from a certain party for being in charge of the plainclothes team. Several of his subordinates and confidants received a disproportionate share of the funds, which caused resentment among two or three people. They had the intention of coveting the reward offered by the authorities. A month ago, they indirectly inquired with Chinese officials whether they could receive a government reward if they captured Hao. At that time, government officials, considering it as detective work, replied that since there was a clear arrest warrant, a reward would naturally be given for meritorious service. The government did not pay attention to this matter at first.</p>
<h3>(Woken Up in a Dream and Forced into a Car)</h3>
<p>Hao Peng, who was in his residence in the Japanese Concession the night before, suddenly followed his adjutant Yuan and others' plan to capture Hao. Because Hao had six or seven guards around him on weekdays, including two confidants, Yuan et al. devised a plan that night to send his confidants to a brothel in the Japanese Concession to prostitute themselves, leaving only one adjutant behind. After Hao fell asleep, he went to rest himself. At about 4:00 AM yesterday morning, Yuan took Hao's pistol out of the safe and opened the gate of the house. At the time, a car was parked outside the gate. Two people accompanied Yuan upstairs and entered Hao's bedroom. At the time, Hao was still sound asleep. After Yuan et al. woke him up, seeing that the people who came were two strangers, he suspected that something had happened. Then he saw that the people who came had each drawn their pistols. Knowing that he could not resist, he asked to put on his clothes and go with them, but he was not allowed. They dragged Hao down the stairs, put him in the car, and drove through the winding alleys towards the Chinese area to avoid the police. At about 5:00 AM, they arrived at the First Army Corps Headquarters. The police along the way did not recognize him because Hao was only wearing shorts, with his upper body naked and his lower body barefoot. Having just recovered from his fright, he was bought pants, a jacket, and a coat by the military department to cover his body.</p>
<h3>(Military Department Interrogates Hao's Confessions)</h3>
<p>The interrogation began immediately. Hao did not deny the matter of plotting rebellion. He admitted that he had appointed Zhang Zizhou and his three brothers in Baodi and Yutian counties. Although many other appointment letters had been issued, he did not know about them and they were mostly done by Wu Ziliang. Because the military department had previously arrested Zhang Zizhou and others, who had confessed that they were appointed by Hao, Hao also confessed. However, he firmly denied participating in the Tianjin Incident, saying that he opposed it. He said that the plainclothes team only had 2,000 people, how could they capture Tianjin City? He had known Chairman Yu before and knew that he was upright. Regarding the disturbances in Tianjin City, he had suggested to the Japanese not to do it. As for the various armies appointed in various counties, it was because he was dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's administration and control.</p>
<h3>(Report to the Central Government for Legal Trial)</h3>
<p>After 10:00 AM yesterday, Japanese Consul Tanaka went to the military department to see Chairman Yu about this matter. Chairman Yu was away at the city government office, so Chief of Staff Liu saw him instead. Tanaka said that the Chinese government's cross-border arrest of people was embarrassing to the Japanese police and military police. When Wang Yimin was the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, he had crossed the border to arrest Liu Xuegu, and as a result, the Public Security Bureau apologized. This matter is even more serious than the Liu case. Please do not take any action against Hao for the time being. After Chief of Staff Liu asked Yu for instructions, he replied that he had not crossed the border to arrest anyone. This matter was internal strife among accomplices. Hao Peng was a wanted criminal by the central and provincial governments. Since he had been brought to justice, he should be tried according to law. The Japanese consul said that it was still necessary to conduct an investigation to determine whether the Chinese authorities had crossed the border to arrest people. It is reported that Yu has telegraphed the central government and the Peiping Military Commission's Political Readjustment Committee, reporting the details. Because Hao is a wanted criminal by the central government, it is possible that he will be escorted to Nanjing or Peiping for trial before a decision is made. As for Yuan et al., who arrested Hao, they will also be rewarded. (July 7)</p>

<h3>The War Zone is About to Begin to be Taken Over</h3>
<p>‖Representatives Sent to Dalian Have Returned to Beiping</p>
<p>Huang Fu Discusses the Content of the Negotiations‖</p>
<p>Beiping Telegraph. The Chinese and Japanese representatives have achieved results in Dalian regarding the discussion of issues such as the disposition of puppet troops and the opening of traffic on the Beining Railway. Our representatives, Lei Shourong, Xue Zhiheng, and Yin Tong, took the Japanese ship Tianjin Maru from Dalian the day before yesterday (the 7th) at 5 p.m. and arrived in Tanggu today (the 8th) at 4 p.m. They changed to a special train and came west, passing through Tianjin at about 5 p.m. Xue and Lei got off the train in Tianjin, and Yin Tong and Qian Zongze took the original train to Beiping. They arrived at the East Railway Station at 8:40 p.m. that evening. After getting off the train, they went to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin to report on the negotiations in Dalian and to ask for instructions on everything. It is planned to go to Tianjin tomorrow morning to negotiate with Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Acceptance Committee, and others on how to proceed. Tonight (the 8th), Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, told reporters, "The trip of our representatives to Dalian to negotiate with the Japanese representatives is a formality after the armistice agreement. It is not a meeting. The representatives were not issued certificates and had no power to sign. The rumors that a meeting was held in Dalian and that it has been signed are completely untrue. Now, various issues have been discussed and are about to be dealt with. The rumor that a formal meeting will be held in Tanggu is also unreliable. If there are no other twists and turns in the acceptance of the war zone, it will be completed within this month. The Japanese side has expressed considerable sincerity. The Japanese troops within the war zone can be completely withdrawn to the Great Wall line within days. The rumors that the Japanese army will leave a part of the surveillance force in the war zone are absolutely untrue. That night, the Japanese side sent a representative to see me and made some representations, and made clear the sincerity of the Japanese side. The solution to the puppet army problem is extremely difficult. After several negotiations, a general agreement has now been reached. There are more than 12,000 puppet troops in total. At first, Li Jichun and others requested that all of them be incorporated, some into the security team and some into other troops. The two sides negotiated and gradually reduced the number. It has now been decided to incorporate one-third into the security team, and the rest will be dismissed. As for the traffic problem on the Beining Railway, a complete agreement has now been reached, and traffic will be opened soon. The progress of this Sino-Japanese negotiation has been extremely difficult. The point where the two sides are most likely to misunderstand is that the armistice is not a proper agreement. Because of the entire issue of the three northeastern provinces and the domestic and international relations, our side believes that this armistice agreement is a simple local armistice, and it is not a proper agreement. However, the Japanese side is also inconsistent internally, and opponents often use the armistice as a pretext to incite from it, so obstacles are frequent and difficulties are particularly numerous," he said. In recent days, the Japanese troops on various routes have been preparing to withdraw, and it is scheduled to begin on the 10th. The Japanese troops in Tangshan, Ninghe, and Fengrun plan to withdraw eastward along the Beining Road. The Japanese troops in Jixian, Ningyun, Pinggu, Zunhua, and Xinglong counties can also withdraw to the Great Wall line within the next week. Our side is scheduled to begin accepting various places in the war zone from the 10th. The traffic on the Beining Railway is also scheduled to resume on the 15th. All matters are presided over by the Acceptance Committee. The committee will hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss everything (July 8).</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan</p>
<h3>Deliberating the Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes</h3>
<p>｜Applicable to State-Run Enterprises｜</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Industry previously believed that the revision of the Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes to apply to state-run enterprises would be difficult to implement. They specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The Labor Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan has completed its review and has drafted four points of response, which were submitted to the 25th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 7th and passed according to the review opinions. The Labor Law Committee's presentation is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Presentation for a reply. According to the Executive Yuan's instruction No. 55, the Executive Yuan's consultation No. 26 was approved. According to the joint presentation of Zhu Jia-hua, Minister of Communications, Gu Meng-yu, Minister of Railways, and Chen Gong-bo, Minister of Industry, requesting the forwarding to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration of the revised articles of the Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes, in order to facilitate its application. It is found that the method of estimating the arbitration committee members in the first paragraph of Article 16 of the revised Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes has been drafted by the Ministry of Industry. Regarding the method of estimating the arbitration committee members of state-run enterprises in the second paragraph of the article, the Ministry of Industry has also sent a letter to the Central Executive Committee, the Mass Movement Guidance Committee, and the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Military Administration to discuss the matter. A meeting will be held at the Ministry of Industry on the 12th of this month (i.e., December 21) to discuss the matter. It is generally believed that the revision of the Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes to apply to state-run enterprises would be difficult to implement. The details are listed as follows: First, the nature of state-run enterprises is very different from that of general enterprises. In general enterprises, although there is a labor-capital relationship, the workers in state-run enterprises provide their labor to the government, that is, they directly serve the country. Therefore, a labor-capital relationship that is mutually opposed cannot be established between the workers and the state. Second, since there should be no labor-capital relationship between the workers of state-run enterprises and the government, the workers' organizations of state-run enterprises should not be able to conclude group agreements with the government. However, the second paragraph of Article 7 of the revised Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes clearly stipulates that "the aforementioned adjudication shall be regarded as a contract between the parties to the dispute. If one of the parties is a labor union, it shall be regarded as a group agreement between the parties to the dispute." This principle is not only inconsistent, but also conflicts with the provisions of Article 16 of the Labor Union Law, which states that "the labor unions organized by the workers of various enterprises listed in Article 3 have no right to conclude group agreements." Third, the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 16 and the first paragraph of Article 15 of the revised Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes prove that the capital representative referred to in the fourth clause of the first paragraph of Article 15 shall be estimated by the direct competent authority of each enterprise. In addition, the provisions of Article 2 and the first clause of the first paragraph of Article 15 of this law prove that the government representative in the first clause of the first paragraph of Article 15 shall be estimated by the competent authority of each enterprise. According to the legal text, although there is a distinction between "direct competent authority" and "competent authority" in state-run enterprises, the direct competent authority and the competent authority are actually the same administrative system. Therefore, the government representative stipulated in the first clause of the first paragraph of Article 15 of this law and the capital representative stipulated in the fourth clause are actually mixed into one. In addition, the government or capital has occupied two of the five arbitration committee members stipulated in the article, which seems to be inconsistent with the original legislative intention of equal arbitration. Fourth, if a dispute occurs in a state-run enterprise, it is no different from a dispute between the workers of the state-run enterprise and the national administrative agency. Therefore, there is also a question as to whether the arbitration agency organized in accordance with Article 15 of this law has the right to arbitrate. How should the above points be resolved? It is reasonable to present them to the review and give instructions. In response to this, we should inform you to check and review the report. This order is to be obeyed, etc. In accordance with this, this committee, after holding several meetings to discuss jointly and soliciting the opinions of the governments of Nanjing and Shanghai for reference, now respectfully lists the decided points as follows: ㈠ Among economic enterprises, there are those that are independently operated by the people, but they are unable to bear the financial burden, and it is not easy to recruit talents. There are also those that are monopolized by private individuals, which are beneficial to the rich and harmful to the common people, and ultimately lead to harm to the national economy, while the government suffers from it in secret. Therefore, they are attributed to state operation. This type of state-run enterprise, although the main body of its operation is the state, and the workers engaged in it, although they serve the government, can be said to be an employment relationship in nature, and a contractual relationship in law, which is not comparable to compulsory labor. Therefore, the employed workers and the main body of state-run enterprises are not those who cannot establish a mutually opposed labor-capital relationship as claimed by the Ministry of Communications, etc. ㈡ The labor unions organized by the workers of various enterprises listed in Article 3 of the Labor Union Law have no right to conclude group agreements. The articles of Article 16 of the revised Labor Union Law have been clearly stipulated, and it is not a conflict between the two regulations as claimed by the Ministry of Communications, etc. ㈢ The representatives stipulated in the fourth clause of the first paragraph of Article 15 of the revised Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes are assigned by the labor and capital parties of other state-run enterprises that have no direct interest in the dispute. Therefore, the representatives of the first clause of the first paragraph of Article 15 and the representatives of the fourth clause will not be out of the same administrative system as claimed by the Ministry of Communications, etc., and it is also easy to clarify. Moreover, since the representatives of the fourth clause have no direct interest in the dispute, it does not hinder the principle of equal arbitration. ㈣ If a dispute occurs in a state-run enterprise and the Law on Handling Labor-Capital Disputes is applied, the arbitration agency organized in accordance with Article 15 of this law naturally has the right to arbitrate the parties to the dispute, and there is no doubt about it. Whether the above points decided by this meeting are appropriate, it is reasonable to submit a document to reply and respectfully await submission to the general assembly for public decision."</p>

<h3>Reducing the Fisheries Construction Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association levied a fisheries construction tax of 5%, and entrusted various fish firms to collect it from the fishermen on their behalf. The fish firms refused because the fishermen were poor and could not afford it. Now, this construction tax has been reduced to 1% and is still collected by the fish firms on their behalf. The counties along Taihu Lake, such as Wu County, Wuxi, and Wujiang, are collected by the Taihu-Suzhou Collection Bureau. It is heard that the fish firms have agreed to collect it on behalf of the collection bureau after the collection bureau's dredging.</p>
<h3>The Railway Hotel Dispute Continues</h3>
<p>The labor-capital dispute at the Suzhou Railway Hotel, which has been going on for a long time, has been sued by Chen Lanting, the manager of the Railway Hotel, to the local court, accusing the hotel workers Zhu Haitang and Xia Jinquan of destroying documents. The court opened a hearing on the 6th. In court, the two workers voluntarily resigned and expressed remorse to Chen Lanting. A settlement record was signed on the spot. Therefore, the outside world believed that the matter could be brought to an end. However, the two workers believed that the court's handling of the matter exceeded the scope of the lawsuit, and specially submitted a letter to the Tourism Industry Union, which was submitted to the County Party Department, and forwarded to the Central Party Department, requesting that work be resumed quickly in accordance with the Labor Union Law in order to maintain the rule of law. Chiang Kai-shek of Nanchang also consulted the Central Party Department on the basis of the investigation report of the Tax Police Regiment to handle the matter impartially.</p>

<h3>Investigating the Issue of Moving the Flag Station</h3>
<p>Jingxi Road outside the south gate of this town is the main road to various places outside the south gate. However, it is quite inconvenient for the villagers to take the train to the south gate flag station. The station is one mile away from the intersection of Jingxi Road, and it is located in a remote area. It is particularly worrying for passengers to carry luggage at night. Chen Yixin, a standing committee member of the Third Sub-branch of the First District Party Department, in view of this, sent a letter to Qian Zhongliang, Director of the First District, and Zhang Guangdi, Director of the Second District, and forwarded it to the county government, requesting the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration to find a way to relocate the station to benefit passengers. After receiving the report, Magistrate Yan believed that this matter was closely related to the county's transportation, and specially sent Qin Xiangtao, an engineer from the Technical Office, to the south gate flag station and other places to survey the area at 8 a.m. yesterday. It was found that the flag station at the intersection of Jingxi Road was about 1.7 miles away. If a road is opened from the Dagong Bridge in the south gate to the Baoshansi Temple and connected to the railway, the cost of the project will be very large. Moreover, it will pass through Kuatang Bridge in the middle, which will make the project even more costly. Therefore, it is best to relocate the flag station. The results of the survey were reported to Zhang Fulin, Director of Technology, and submitted to the county administration meeting today (the 10th) for resolution.</p>
<h3>Opposing Extra Collection Methods</h3>
<p>Since the Finance Bureau of Xiyi was merged, the collection of land tax is now handled by a separate collection office in the county, which is divided into three sections: land tax, miscellaneous tax, and inspection, each with a director, in order to specialize in handling affairs. The first installment of land price tax for this 22nd year was originally scheduled to be levied on July 1, but it was postponed until yesterday because the procedures at the ledger office were not completed, and the notification forms were distributed to each household. The tax is calculated as follows: Each mu of paddy field should be levied with a provincial tax of 4 jiao 4 fen 3 hao, a county tax of 9 fen 4 li 4 hao, a collection fee of 2 fen 6 li 7 hao, a local tax of 8 fen 2 hao, a popular education fee of 8 fen, an education fee of 2 fen 3 li 4 hao, an inspection fee of 1 jiao 2 fen, a road construction fee of 5 fen, an agricultural fee of 2 fen, a budget compensation fee of 2 fen 6 li, and a pest control fee of 5 li, totaling 9 jiao 6 fen 6 li. The first installment is levied at 40%. In addition, this year, according to the provincial order, each mu is levied with a land survey fee of 1 jiao and a security patrol donation of 2 fen per bill. Magistrate Yan believed that the additional tax levied this time exceeded one-third of the land tax, which conflicted with the regulations of the provincial authorities, so a land survey fee collection office was set up separately in the collection office, and Yao Meixuan and others were appointed as clerks. Each time a household goes to pay the land tax, they must obtain a land survey fee receipt and pay it in accordance with the printed bill. Xue Mingjian, a resident of Yiyi, believed that at a time when the rural economy is extremely depressed, since the county magistrate can take into account the additional tax regulations, he should not set this precedent of accommodating bad examples, so as to open up the false atmosphere among the people and gradually increase the extra collection in the future. Yesterday, he specially sent letters to the Party Department and various public organizations to declare his opposition, and requested that other appropriate measures be taken.</p>

<h3>Swearing-in Ceremony to Commemorate the Northern Expedition</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Convenes a Memorial Meeting</p>
<p>More than 100 Representatives from Various Agencies Attend</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 7th anniversary of the swearing-in ceremony of the National Revolutionary Army for the Northern Expedition. At 9 a.m., the Municipal Party Department convened representatives from all walks of life and held a memorial meeting on the third floor of the Municipal Party Department. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including Zhang Mengling, representative of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Zemin, representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhu Guilin, representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and representatives of various district party departments, district sub-departments, and municipal primary schools. Long Tiyao, member of the Municipal Party Department, presided over the meeting, Fan Mingyao served as the master of ceremonies, and Tong Muge took the minutes. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>(Chairman's Report)</h3>
<p>Chairman Long Tiyao's report briefly stated that today is the 7th anniversary of the swearing-in ceremony of the National Revolutionary Army for the Northern Expedition. Seven years ago today, the Northern Expedition proceeded very smoothly. We recall that there were two very optimistic phenomena at that time: First, the people and the revolutionary army were very united. Second, the will of the comrades of our party was particularly concentrated. The people and the comrades of our party worked together under the goals set by our party. Therefore, all military and political disputes could be resolved easily and without any obstacles. In less than a year, the Northern Expedition was successful. Later, unfortunately, the Communist Party disrupted the situation from the inside, using pleasant terms to incite the people. When the government established a foundation, the power of the Communist Party began to subside slightly. We have learned a good lesson from this and feel that no matter what kind of helpless period military and political affairs reach, there must be a strong party force to preside over everything. Especially in the military, the leader is the most important. The biggest shortcoming of our side in the North China war is the lack of unified military command. Every time it comes to a critical moment, the leaders discuss military affairs and should meet to discuss the problems. After the meeting, the military situation on the front line has changed, so the result is a disastrous defeat, which is really heartbreaking. Critics only blame the lack of equipment compared to others, but they only know one thing and not the other. Looking at the world's countries, such as Germany with Hitler, Italy with Mussolini, Turkey with Kemal, and Soviet Russia with Lenin and Stalin, there is a supreme leader to command everything, and then there is success. Even the United States, which calls itself a democracy, is now in a state of economic downturn, and is even proposing to decide all political power by Roosevelt alone. In ancient Greece, there were two major classes: one was the ruling class, and the other was the slave class. A minority ruled and controlled everything. Those without economic power could not participate in</p>
<p>Parliamentary activities. From a historical perspective, the pleasant term "democracy" is actually a means of oppression and deception by the oppressive class against the oppressed class. At present, China absolutely does not need this idle theory of chanting wind and moon. We want to work hard, to obey, and to have a true leader. Today, when we look back on the past, why was it easy to succeed during the Northern Expedition, but now the situation is gradually declining? These questions are worthy of our discussion, and so on. After the speech, the crowd shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>
<h3>(Slogans)</h3>
<p>1.  Swearing-in ceremony to commemorate the Northern Expedition is the initial work of the national revolution.</p>
<p>2.  The success of the Northern Expedition is the prelude to the realization of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>3.  To commemorate the Northern Expedition, we must abide by the will of the Premier.</p>
<p>4.  To commemorate the Northern Expedition, we must work hard for national construction.</p>
<p>5.  To commemorate the Northern Expedition, we must suppress bandits and resist Japan.</p>
<p>6.  Down with imperialism.</p>
<p>7.  Long live the success of the national revolution.</p>
<p>8.  Long live the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>9.  Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton Production Improvement Association</p>
<h3>Held its Second Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Today's Discussion on the Proposal for American Cotton Loan</p>
<p>Zeng Yangfu Speaks on the Opinions on Cotton Industry Improvement</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Production Improvement Association held its second annual meeting yesterday at the Xiaoshichang of the Huashang Yarn Cloth Exchange at 80 Aiduya Road. The meeting opened at 9 a.m. First, Mr. Love, consultant of the Ministry of Industry, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, and others were invited to give speeches. Then, five review committee members were selected. At 2 p.m., the meeting continued. Zhu Xianfang of the Textile Association gave a speech, and representatives from various provinces gave reports. The meeting will be held from 8 a.m. today to discuss important issues such as rural revitalization and the distribution of American cotton. The details of each item are as follows</p>
<h3>(Attending Representatives)</h3>
<p>Fang Junqiang of the Anhui Construction Department and Provincial Cotton Field, Yang Xiandong of the Hubei Cotton Industry Improvement Committee and Hubei Construction Department, Ren Jimin of the Agricultural College of Shandong University, Hu Changzhun of the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry and Provincial Second Cotton Field, Dachen of the Jiangxi Provincial Lake Mouth Agricultural Field, Zhao Lianfang of the Agricultural College of Central University, Feng Zhaochuan of the Zhejiang Provincial Cotton Field, Wu Weijia, Song Kangxiang of the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Field, Yu Yanshou, Nie Lusheng of the United Association of Chinese Cotton Mills, Zhang Zemin, Jiang Dixian, Xu Tigang of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, Xu Zhen, Jinling University Agricultural College, Chen Yanshan, Xu Zhongdi, Ye Yuanding of the Hankou and Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Zou Bingwen of the Shanghai Bank, Lu Feishuchen of the Zhonghua Book Company, Feng Da of the Shenxin General Company, Wang Jingu of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, Zhu Xianfang of the China Textile Society, Chen Songyuan of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liu Jingji of the Dacheng Yarn Mill, Ding Ruoting of the Tianjin Municipal Yarn Mill Association, Love, Agricultural Consultant of the Ministry of Industry, Zeng Yangfu, Director of Zhejiang Construction, Yuan Hui of the Hunan Construction Department and Provincial Cotton Field, Wu Hengru of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the director of the Jiangsu County Agricultural Extension Institute, totaling 60 people, elected the presidium as Nie Lusheng, Lu Feizhi, Ye Yuanding, Feng Zhaochuan, and Yang Xiandong, Secretary Jiang Dixian, Wu Weijing, Recorder Wu Weijing, Ji Zhonghe, Jiang Zenong, and Zhai Xingeng.</p>
<h3>‖Chairman's Address‖</h3>
<p>After the meeting was held as scheduled, Chairman Nie Lusheng delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that the Chinese Cotton Production Improvement Association is holding its second annual meeting today, and representatives from various provinces have come from afar to attend, which is very pleasant. Although the Standing Committee has made plans from time to time during this year and made suggestions to the Central Government or various provinces, there have been no results, which is regrettable. The importance of China's cotton production problem is far-reaching. Without discussing it for the time being, foreign cotton imports reached more than 4 million dan in the 20th year of the Republic of China and more than 3 million dan in the 21st year. China is ranked third in the world, but it imports so much raw cotton. The area of ​​China is greater than that of the United States, and the import of American cotton reaches more than 2 million dan, which is really alarming. If such a situation cannot be remedied, it will be difficult to survive even without foreign insults. Therefore, we are gathered here today to reflect on the importance and urgency of the mission we bear. This meeting is only two days, and the agenda and speeches take a lot of time. I hope that we can discuss together how to jointly improve the domestic cotton production and how to ask the government and society to cooperate and work hard, etc. Then, Jiang Dixian reported on the progress of the association's affairs and the receipts and expenditures of accounts during the year.</p>
<h3>(A Glimpse of Speeches)</h3>
<p>After the report, guest speakers gave speeches. (1) Zou Bingwen of the Shanghai Bank gave a speech, briefly stating that in order to improve cotton production, we should pay attention to improving quality and expanding production, but we should also study the transportation and marketing of cotton, that is, how to make the improved cotton reach the sales and reduce the losses of cotton farmers and the burden of consumers without going through intermediaries, etc. (2) Dr. Love, Industrial Consultant of the Ministry of Industry, spoke on the "Plan for the Development of China's National Cotton Industry," which was translated by Chen Yanshan. The speech was very long, briefly stating that China does not have a complete plan for improving cotton production, so the results are very small. China needs a lot of cotton, estimating 1.5 yuan per person per year. The annual import of foreign cotton reaches more than 100 million yuan, so the importance of improving cotton production can be known. To improve China's cotton production, there should be a complete plan, and the problems can be divided into three points: (1) research, (2) demonstration, (3) promotion. First, there must be research, where is suitable for cotton, which kind of cotton is suitable for which place, how to breed, and obtain good new varieties. After obtaining new varieties, we must also make demonstrations so that farmers know its excellence and are happy to apply it. Some say that China is conservative and that it is difficult to promote improvements. In fact, it is not so. Chinese farmers are conservative, like the United States.</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the Chinese Cotton Production Improvement Association (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</h3>
<p>Same. If you want them not to be conservative, you must use demonstration methods. After the demonstration, you can promote it. Farmers already have considerable faith in the demonstration, so promotion is easy. Research, demonstration, and promotion must be unified by a central organization to communicate with the provinces and cooperate to avoid duplication and waste of money. Second, the training of talents is also important. It is better to hire foreign experts to train in China than to send talents abroad for training. The cost is lower and the results are greater. If the talents trained in China still need to do special research, then they can be selected and sent abroad. Next, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, spoke on "Zhejiang's Policy for Improving the Cotton Industry," briefly stating that Zhejiang was originally a cotton-producing province, self-sufficient and short of tens of thousands of dan. The deficiency of this situation is that Zhejiang cotton can only spin coarse yarn of 10 to 12 counts, which cannot meet the needs of Shanghai yarn mills. The poor quality of this is why the Zhejiang cotton improvement policy seeks progress in both quality and quantity. Recently, the million cotton promoted by Zhejiang Province can harvest a quarter more per mu than local cotton. Because of its better quality, each dan can be sold a quarter more than local cotton. If the promotion of million cotton is successful, farmers will gain half of the benefits, which cannot be said to be insignificant. If all the sea sand fields are reclaimed into cotton fields, the progress of Zhejiang cotton will be even more considerable. The difficulty is that promotion is very difficult. In order to solve this difficulty, Zhejiang Province has created effective methods in promotion. (1) Use political power. For example, if million rice has proven to be a suitable and excellent variety in a certain area, all the cotton fields in the area should be ordered to plant million cotton by political power, and other varieties are not allowed to be planted. This not only increases the efficiency of promotion, but also can control the reproduction of pure and good seeds, and cooperation in transportation and sales is also easy to promote. (2) All parties cooperate to establish the Zhejiang Cotton Industry Improvement Committee, uniting yarn mills, flower bank financial circles, cotton farmers and the government to work together to develop the industry. (3) Unified management. The seeds, fertilizers, drainage and transportation, etc. in the improvement implementation area are all under the guidance of the government for unified management. All of these have been very effective in the promotion of silkworm eggs. In terms of cotton, I don't think it will fail. In addition, promotion talents are being cultivated by the agricultural promotion personnel training institute for implementation work talents for application. However, the improvement and promotion of the entire cotton industry is by no means something that a few people can do. I hope that all sectors present will give their practical cooperation. Zhejiang Province is confident that it has a slight foundation in agricultural promotion, but it is not sure how successful it will be in the future. In order to make progress, I am very willing to offer Zhejiang Province for your cotton industry improvement experiments as a reference for the whole country. I hope you will not hesitate to give your advice. After the speech, it was already 12 o'clock, so we took a lunch break.</p>
<h3>‖Afternoon Meeting‖</h3>
<p>At 2 PM, the meeting continued, chaired by Ye Yuanding. Zhu Xianfang spoke about the quality and quantity of raw materials needed for China's textile industry in the future, stating that the quality and quantity of raw cotton needed by China in the future would improve daily. To meet the needs, the first phase would require 1.3 million dan of cotton fibers up to one inch,</p>
<p>3.3 million dan for 1.25 inches, and 600,000 dan for 1.5 inches or more, totaling 6.2 million dan. The second phase would require 10.1 million dan of cotton fibers up to one inch, 4.7 million dan for 1.25 inches, and 1 million dan for 1.5 inches or more, totaling 15.8 million dan. With the increasing progress of human civilization and the rationalization of industrial management, the above-mentioned quality and quantity of raw cotton are by no means an exaggeration. It is hoped that the cotton planting experts present will make preparations for this. Afterwards, Professor Xu Zhongdi of Jinling University gave a speech on the cotton marketing cooperation in the United States, briefly stating that American cotton farmers, oppressed by debt and suffering losses in trade due to the lack of standardized cotton grades, have organized marketing cooperatives. With the guidance of the government, the assistance of agricultural schools, and the support of banks, their business has progressed rapidly, and their social credit has increased daily, giving them the power to resist drastic market changes without the drawbacks of manipulation and monopoly. Both farmers and factories benefit from this, and it is hoped that those engaged in the cotton industry in China will also emulate this, which will definitely have a positive impact on the future of the entire cotton industry.</p>
<h3>‖Nomination for Review‖</h3>
<p>The conference nominated Fang Junqiang, Zhao Lianfang,</p>

<p>The Chinese National Silk Brocade Exhibition officially opened at 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The opening ceremony was performed by actress Hu Die. Wu Xingya delivered the opening address, Liu Weichi, Kong Xiangxi, and others spoke, and the number of visitors reached over 20,000, exceeding the new record for all previous national products movements. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Opening of the Conference</h3>
<p>Attendees included Honorary Chairman Wu Tiecheng (represented by Yu Hongjun), Chairman Wu Xingya, Vice Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Committee Members Luo Qinghua, Tu Zhongying, Ma Shaoquan, Zheng Dengqing, and guests from all walks of life Liu Weichi, Pan Gongzhan, Kong Xiangxi (represented by Fan Heyan), and over 200 others.</p>
<p>The conference staff included Chairman Wu Tiecheng (represented by Yu Hongjun), Wu Xingya, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yansong, Master of Ceremonies Cao Zhigong, Recorder Ye Weiyi, General Reception Luo Qinghua, Ren Jinping, General Inspectors Zheng Dengqing, Ma Shaoquan, Reception: all members of the Silk Brocade and Silk Weaving Associations, all staff of the Silk Industry Bank, in addition to the Boy Scouts of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and over 30 police officers from the Fifth District Public Security Bureau maintained order at the venue. The Star Film Company also filmed at the venue.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 1:30 PM in the auditorium of the Chamber of Commerce: 1) The Municipal Public Security Bureau Band played music; 2) Three bows were made to the Party and the national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen; 3) The chairman respectfully read the will; 4) Chairman Wu Xingya delivered the opening address; 5) Liu Weichi, Yu Hongjun, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Xiaolai, and others spoke in succession; 6) Vice Chairman Wang Yansong reported on the preparations (speeches recorded separately). By this time it was 3 PM, and the entertainment began.</p>
<p>Hu Die's opening of the exhibition venue also opened at 2 PM in the afternoon. Vice Chairmen Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong accompanied Ms. Hu Die to the venue to hold the opening ceremony. They walked around the exhibition hall from the entrance to the exit for a week. The audience, eager to see the true face of Hu Die, scrambled to be the first, causing the road to be blocked. Hu Die sighed, "I can't move forward!" The Boy Scouts made every effort to maintain order before they could pass.</p>
<p>Crowded Audience: Yesterday's attendance reached over 20,000 people. By 1 PM in the afternoon, it was already extremely crowded. The entrance to the entertainment venue was originally maintained by the Boy Scouts. At 1:30 PM, visitors poured in like a flood. The Boy Scouts were unable to collect tickets, so they hung up the "Full" sign first, but visitors still took the opportunity to squeeze in. The venue was also extremely crowded due to the large number of people. Then, the gate was opened to allow people to enter and exit as they pleased. Those inside felt hot and stuffy, and those outside wanted to see what was happening, so conflicts were bound to arise. Therefore, after opening, the order was restored.</p>
<p>Distribution of Items: At yesterday's conference venue, Lao Jiu Lun, Nanyang Tobacco Company, Daxin, etc. distributed gifts based on the admission tickets. However, there were so many visitors that there were too few gifts for too many people. In an instant, they were all gone. Those who arrived later could not receive them, and some raised questions. The conference staff politely advised them, and they calmed down and remained silent.</p>
<p>Performance of Entertainment: The conference performed various entertainment programs: 1) Ms. Zhang Zhiyuan's piano solo; 2) Martial Arts Troupe's performance of national martial arts; 3) Huadong Girls' High School's performance of the new play "Happy Mary"; 4) Lianhua Film Company's screening of films; 5) Postal Workers' Union's performance of various magic tricks to add to the fun.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Wu Xingya's opening speech: Distinguished guests, this conference has been prepared for two weeks, and the enthusiastic participation of colleagues in the silk brocade industry has given us the opportunity to appreciate the vast array of silk brocade from thousands of households. At the same time, we are honored by the presence and guidance of guests from all walks of life, and their vigorous promotion has made this conference a preliminary success.</p>
<p>History of National Silk: Silk brocade is a family heirloom passed down by our ancestors for more than 5,000 years. Since Leizu taught the people how to raise silkworms, silk reeling and weaving have gradually improved. In ancient Greece and Rome, China exported a large amount of silk. It was introduced to Japan and India in the third century AD, to Eastern Rome in the sixth century, and was imitated by France and Italy after the twelfth century. Now, China, Japan, India, Italy, Germany, France, and other countries are all silk weaving countries.</p>
<p>Evolution of the Silk Industry: The method of weaving silk was initially just weaving warp and weft, forming a simple plain product. Later, patterns were added using needle pricking. Then, there was the invention of the Jacquard device. In the Guangxu era, new-style Jacquard looms and hand-drawn iron-wood composite looms were imported from Japan. After the founding of the Republic of China, the silk weaving industry gradually transformed from a household industry into a company organization. Wooden "Jacquard" Jacquard looms and hand-drawn iron-wood composite looms were initially used, followed by Japanese iron-wood composite electric looms. In 1918, the Shanghai American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory adopted new-style iron electric looms. Later, other factories also successively adopted new-style European and American machines. At this time, the Chinese silk weaving industry began to embark on the road of new-style industry.</p>
<p>Industrial Status: In terms of industry type, the textile industry is the first; in terms of region, Shanghai is the first. In the textile industry, in addition to the cotton industry ranking first, the next is the silk reeling industry and the silk weaving industry. According to previous statistics from the Social Affairs Bureau, the total capital of Shanghai's textile industry is approximately 200 million yuan, of which Chinese capital accounts for 50 million yuan. Among this 50 million yuan, in addition to the cotton weaving industry, the silk reeling industry accounts for approximately 2.5 million yuan, and the silk weaving industry accounts for approximately 1.3 million yuan. Among the 1.3 million yuan in the silk weaving industry, sole proprietorships account for approximately 3%, partnerships account for approximately 40%, and companies account for approximately 57%. This means that the silk weaving industry has gradually moved away from handicrafts and into new-style industry, from small-scale operations to large-scale operations.</p>
<h3>Opening of the National Silk and Satin Exhibition (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier regarding foreign trade, Chinese silk and satin were already being exported in large quantities during the ancient Greek and Roman eras. After the opening of maritime trade, silk and tea from China held the top positions in international trade. However, in recent years, silk has fallen to second place, and tea has dropped to seventh place, while beans have risen to first place. However, most beans are produced in the Northeast region. The tyrannical Japanese forces have now forcibly occupied the four northeastern provinces, and the export of beans is no longer a major export of our country. As for the export of silk and satin, firstly, the artificial silk substitutes of European and American countries have overwhelmed natural silk, and secondly, the increased tariffs in Vietnam, Korea, and India have severely impacted the foreign sales of Chinese domestic silk and satin. The export value in the 18th year [of the Republic] was over 21 million taels, over 19 million taels in the 19th year, over 24 million taels in the 20th year, and over 18 million taels in the 21st year. If it continues</p>
<p>to decline, the foreign sales of domestic silk and satin will be impossible to predict.</p>
<p>The silk industry affects our country's natural silk products, amounting to about 250,000 shi per year, of which about 130,000 shi are sold abroad and about 120,000 shi are sold domestically. In recent years, due to reduced cocoon production and high silk prices, domestic silk factories have mostly welcomed the use of artificial silk for blending, resulting in an annual increase in artificial silk imports. It was over 2.3 million taels in the 13th year, over 2.6 million taels in the 14th year, over 4.8 million taels in the 15th year, over 5.3 million taels in the 16th year, and has continued to increase since the 17th year. Although our authorities once increased tariffs on artificial silk, factories still find it more cost-effective to use artificial silk. The reasons for advocating the use of artificial silk are that since the enlightenment of science, artificial skills have surpassed natural ones. Artificial silk can be made from cotton, silk, and wood fiber, making the cost much lower than that of natural silk. It also has the characteristics of being bright, strong, smooth, and less prone to dust. Even people below the middle class can afford to buy it. If the government neither promotes the manufacture of artificial silk nor imposes heavy import taxes on artificial silk, it will only be disadvantageous to middle and lower-class consumers. Little do they know that artificial silk is rough to the touch, has little resilience, and is weak in water resistance. We must not be fooled by the dumping policies of foreign merchants, thinking that imported goods are cheap and of good quality, thus completely erasing our national products. We certainly acknowledge that domestic silk and satin may be slightly more expensive than artificial silk fabrics, but this is mainly due to cost. If the whole country works together to reduce the cost of silk cocoons, the value of silk and satin will naturally decrease accordingly. Recently, Chinese people have been fond of the novelty of imported goods, willing to pay high prices to buy foreign goods. This can be seen from the increasing import of foreign woolens, while they turn a blind eye to our country's inherent good silk and satin. Eliminate Obstacles ①Unite the Power of Fellow Traders and Make Technical Improvements: The silk and satin industry has been stagnant and isolated for thousands of years. It is necessary to realize that cooperation and mutual learning among peers are essential. This kind of unity is not to form a self-contained clique to monopolize everything, forming an organization similar to the European medieval guilds or craft guilds. This</p>
<p>type of guild or craft guild initially monitored each other, but later, when a certain industry was controlled by a certain guild or craft guild, it did not seek progress itself. Because of the poor quality of goods and outdated technology, it was eventually overthrown by emerging industries. In the past, there were many factions in the silk and satin industry in this city, each with its own territory. For example, guilds and assembly halls were nominally trade organizations, but in reality, they only collected and distributed donations and taxes. In the 16th year of the Republic, the organization of the silk and satin industry branch of the Merchant Association was implemented, but the internal structure was very loose. It was not until the 18th year that the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association was officially established. From then on, the silk and satin industry had a unified organization. ②Cooperation between Financial Institutions and Production Institutions: In the past, we felt a contradictory phenomenon, that is, on the one hand, the capital of the production industry was extremely exhausted and unable to inject funds, and on the other hand, financial institutions were flooded with cash and unable to lend it out. The imbalance between production institutions and financial institutions can be seen everywhere. Originally, banks were the vanguard of developing industries. Without the assistance of banks, there is no precedent in China or the West for industrial development. Now that there is the establishment of the Silk Industry Bank, there will be many places for mutual support in the future, and the benefits to silk and satin will be immeasurable. ③Reduce Donations and Taxes: Foreign goods only need to pay import taxes to circulate freely. Domestic goods, when sold inland, are subject to repeated heavy taxes. This is a great obstacle to domestic products. If we want to compete with foreign goods in the future, we must reduce donations and taxes. ④Reduce Costs: The raw material for silk and satin is natural silk. If silkworm breeds are improved and silk reeling is advanced in the future, costs can be reduced considerably. At the same time, silk factories should continuously adopt the most advanced technology, which can also reduce part of the cost. ⑤Conclude Reciprocal Tax Treaties with Foreign Countries: In recent years, the obstruction of foreign sales of silk fabrics has been mostly due to foreign tariff barriers. For example, places like Korea, Vietnam, and India were originally sales destinations for our country's silk and satin. Due to the increased tax rates, silk and satin merchants have hesitated. Therefore, in order to promote sales, reciprocal treaties should be concluded with various sales countries. ⑥Vigorously Eliminate the Psychology of Domestic Consumers崇尚崇尙Foreign Goods:</p>
<p>China is the largest market in the world, but the Chinese people's superstition in foreign goods is even stronger than the explosive power of the several tens of pounds of grenades used by the anti-traitor corps. Therefore, to eliminate the obstacles of domestic products, we must first eliminate the psychology of superstition in foreign goods and cultivate the habit of loving Chinese goods. Finally, I would like to respectfully advise all the gentlemen who come to visit this exhibition: pleasure for the eyes and ears is also a human habit. Remember that in the past, there was an empress named Daji who liked the sound of silk being torn. Later, people said that King Zhou of Shang lost his country because of this. Now, this association is displaying many brocades and damasks for the guests to identify. I hope that you will not just come to see them. If it is just for good looks, I am afraid that in the future, like Daji's special liking for the sound of silk being torn, you will also suffer the tragic fate of losing your country.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun, Mayor Wu's representative, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, gave a speech, stating that China's silk industry is now facing a very serious crisis. If we do not urgently seek salvation, not only will the industry itself suffer, but the entire national economy will also be affected. Empty talk about promoting domestic products and patching up leaks will not help. We must urgently seek thorough relief from the practical aspects of production and sales. The financial sector and the silk industry should promptly formulate and implement an effective and practical cooperation plan. Although the government cannot adopt protective tariff policies under the constraints of unequal treaties to eliminate the harm of foreign goods dumping, it is deeply believed that the relevant authorities will do their best to assist in the current difficulties of the silk industry in order to gradually find a bright way out. On the part of the people, if they understand that the bankruptcy of the national economy is imminent, they should rise up and catch up, embrace the spirit of perseverance and sacrifice, adopt scientific methods, and study the needs of society and the psychology of the people to engage in the promotion of the domestic silk industry. It is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep.</p>
<p>Kong Yongzhi, President of the Central Bank, Kong Xiangxi's speech, read by Fan Heyan, Secretary of the Central Bank, said: "The Chinese National Silk and Satin Exhibition is a grand event for the industry to promote domestic products. Today's opening is a great honor for me to participate in, and I am very happy to briefly express a few personal thoughts. China has a history of sericulture and silk production of 5,000 years. Because its climate, soil, and labor are all in a superior position, the development of the silk industry is the best in the world. The sericulture and silk production of Italy and other countries are said to have been introduced from China. Fifty years ago, China's silk exports were the undisputed leader in the world. However, in recent years, Japan's silk industry has made rapid progress, and its power in the world market has gradually surpassed China. At most, its export volume accounted for 80% of the world's silk sales, which is five times that of China. China's silk industry has suffered from this blow and is gradually declining. Silkworm farmers and silk factories are even unable to survive. This is really heartbreaking. I went to Europe and the United States to investigate industries before, and I paid special attention to this matter, and solicited opinions from the relevant government officials and industry leaders of various countries. According to the investigation, the reasons for the decline in China's exports and the decline of the silk industry are nothing more than the following points: After the European War, artificial silk made rapid progress for a time, almost taking all the uses of natural silk and replacing it. In 1931, the world's artificial silk production totaled more than 220,000 tons, while natural silk was only more than 99,000 tons (including about 4,000 tons for self-use in China and Japan). The use of artificial silk accounted for 70% of the total silk production. In the past, the silk cocoon market was mostly encroached upon. This is one reason. The economic self-sufficiency of various countries has become a trend, and they all want to rely on domestic production for clothing. For example, the United States and Germany do not produce natural silk, so they are keen to encourage the artificial silk industry for substitution. Now the United States' artificial silk accounts for almost one-third of the world's artificial silk production, and Germany accounts for almost one-seventh. The governments of France and Italy have given strong support to the silk industry in recent years, and their production of natural silk has almost doubled. All of this is enough to hinder the foreign sales of oriental silk. This is the second reason. China's silk industry is stagnant and does not seek progress, so the quality of silk is uneven and the cost is also expensive, making it unable to compete with others. When I met with the Deputy Minister of Commerce in the United States, I talked about this matter, and he said that the quality of Chinese silk is uneven, and it is often necessary to change it during weaving, which makes factories very distressed. The sales of Chinese silk to the United States are declining every year. This is indeed a major reason. As for the price of silk, Chinese silk is more expensive than Japanese silk. This is because Japan uses at most 1,000 catties of cocoons per stone of silk, while China needs 2,000 catties. Japan reels at most 80 taels of silk per person per day, while China reels only 20 taels. It is natural that China's silk industry is being eliminated. This is the third reason. Chinese customs compete for luxury and often like to use foreign goods to show off. In recent years (the 20th year of the Republic), in addition to the import of artificial silk of more than 25 million taels, the import of natural silk products is no less than six or seven million taels. Domestic silk and satin have been significantly eroded. This is the fourth reason. China's silk production and sales have neither a whole plan nor a reasonable organization. Once it is the silkworm season, they temporarily combine, rent factories, and engage in manufacturing. The manufactured silk is sold around, and profits are diverted to others. The supply is difficult to meet, and the cost is increased as a result. Competing with the national silk industry of foreign countries with controlled organizations is naturally easy to fail. This is the fifth reason. When I was the head of the Ministry of Industry, I issued public bonds to relieve the silk industry, took over the raw silk inspection office run by foreigners, and merged it into the Commodity Inspection Bureau to inspect the export silk. I also planned to assist silk merchants and strive to improve the organization and improve manufacturing. It has been many years, but there has been little effect. Now China's foreign trade is increasingly reversing, and last year's import surplus reached more than 500 million taels. As a result, the market is depressed, money is flowing out, the countryside is collapsing, and all industries are declining. The seriousness of the situation and the danger of the future are unprecedented in history. Your association has held this grand exhibition at this difficult time, with a long-term vision, in order to arouse the feelings of the Chinese people and seek the revitalization of the silk industry. The deep intention is commendable. After the European War, Italy had a large import surplus and the people's livelihood was declining. Mussolini took power and vigorously promoted domestic products, ordered public institutions to prohibit the use of foreign goods, and held National Goods Movement Week every year. The people also regarded the use of foreign goods as a shame. Therefore, industry has made rapid progress, and the social economy is becoming more and more prosperous. This spirit of courage and advancement is what we should learn from. I hope that in the future, the people's clothing materials, if they are owned by China, should not use foreign goods, and merchants should also strive to improve the silk industry in order to expand sales and reverse the decline. As for the improvement methods, according to my personal opinion, attention should be paid to several things. First, the silk standard should be determined and strive for uniformity in order to suit foreign machine weaving. Second, the silk and satin for self-use should avoid luxury and strive for simplicity in order to correct the people's extravagant style. Third, silk merchants and factories should unite with each other, organize large-scale factories, and use new-style machines to engage in manufacturing, so as to increase production efficiency and reduce the price of silk and satin to facilitate sales. After the war, Germany's economy flourished, all thanks to the union and merger of industry and commerce. I sincerely hope that our country will use this as a means of attacking and correcting mistakes. Fourth, the export of silk and satin should be directly with foreign merchants, and efforts should be made to publicize it widely. If silk merchants can unite as one to deal with foreign countries, they will have sufficient strength and will be able to manipulate the market. Japanese silk is shipped to the United States, and its contact with all parties is very sensitive, so its power is enough to overwhelm Chinese silk. All these things, although the beginning is big, are all essential plans. What is relied on is the integration of merchants and people, the upper and lower levels supporting each other, each with the determination of concerted efforts to jointly go to the goal of saving the country through industry. The holding of this exhibition is to show the spirit of unity of the silk industry groups. From this, we can expand it and gradually promote it in production and sales, so as to revitalize industry and promote national glory. The industry will begin here. Wang Xiaolai, Vice Chairman, Wang Xiaolai, gave a speech, saying: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the opening ceremony of our National Silk and Satin Exhibition. Thank you very much for your presence and guidance. This shows that everyone loves national silk and satin, and it also means loving the Republic of China. We are very happy and admire you. Ladies and gentlemen, are we now worried about the rural bankruptcy problem in China? We have always attached great importance to agriculture and sericulture since ancient times, and there is an old saying that we should establish the country on agriculture. To put it simply, everyone has to rely on farmers for food. When farmers have no food to eat, everyone will have no food to eat. Don't say that we are hiding in the cities, with foreign rice and wheat to provide us with food and drink, so it doesn't matter. First, the cities cannot accommodate so many people. Second, if we continue like this, what will we use to exchange for foreign rice and wheat? Therefore, if everyone wants to have food to eat, they must first think for the farmers and let them all have food to eat. Ladies and gentlemen, don't say that this</p>
<p>problem cannot be solved by us. As long as we are careful when making clothes</p>
<p>and replace foreign goods with Chinese silk and satin, at least half of the problem will be solved. Ladies and gentlemen, when you travel to Shanghai and Hangzhou, don't you see the mulberry fields along the railway line, which are very green and lovely? In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, half of the lives of farmers are in sericulture. If silkworms are raised well, a farmer can earn an extra one or two hundred yuan a year, which can be used as capital for farming. Even if the rice harvest is a little worse this year, they can still get through it safely. However, in recent years, because cocoons cannot be sold for money and raising silkworms is a loss, many mulberry fields have been destroyed. The capital for farming is lacking, so the production of farmers is decreasing year by year. How can they survive? Why can't cocoons be sold for money? It is because factory silk cannot be sold abroad. The closure of silk factories has caused this phenomenon. Why does China's silk rely entirely on foreign sales and cannot be sold abroad?</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The silkworm and mulberry industry has almost collapsed. This can prove that the sales of domestic silk and satin are not reaching their potential, and their own raw materials cannot be used. As the saying goes, eating is enjoyment and wearing is prestige. The reason why everyone likes to use foreign goods is just to dress up beautifully and show off their status. The reason why we are holding the National Silk and Satin Exhibition is to introduce the best domestic products to the public as much as possible, so that the general ladies can know that we also have the best and newest products, and there is no need to rely on foreign goods. There are also general economic people who usually like to wear wool and serge, but they just want to get a fair price and durable quality. We should take this opportunity to introduce to you that there are also many durable and inexpensive things in our domestic silk and satin. What I said today is not just standing on the merchant's side, advocating business for merchants, nor is it changing direction and appealing to farmers. It is really standing on the national position and feeling that the decline of the countryside is the decline of the entire China. To save this crisis, we must first restore and develop the sericulture industry. The key lies in the public being careful when making clothes. Finally, I would like to make a sincere request to everyone. Everyone should rise up to help the countryside, and should first help sericulture, and should do their best to promote domestic silk and satin, so as to solve the problem of clothing, which can be linked to solve the problem of food, which is the entire people's livelihood problem, and it is not difficult to solve it."</p>
<h3>Preparations</h3>
<p>Vice Chairman Wang Yansong reported on the preparations, saying: "Today is the opening day of the Chinese National Silk and Satin Exhibition jointly organized by the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, the Municipal Silk and Satin Trade Association, the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce National Goods Store. Chairman Wu has already explained in detail the important mission and significance of this association. Now, I will briefly report to you the opportunity and process of the formation of this association. The phenomenon of social depression is almost everywhere, and the weakness of the people's purchasing power is also unprecedented. Therefore, the industry and commerce of all industries are declining and in unspeakable desolation. The reason for this is of course nothing more than being oppressed by strong economies and the collapse of our country's rural areas,</p>
<p>and the impact of the instability of the people's livelihood. Silk and satin are special products of our country, and have always occupied a major position in the international market, and have a very glorious history. But speaking of the current situation, it is also difficult to escape the symptoms of decline. We know that there are too many people in the agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles who rely on the silk and satin industry for their livelihoods. Therefore, in the current high tide of promoting domestic goods, it is considered that the silk and satin industry has a more urgent need for promotion than other industries. This is the main motive for the establishment of this association. The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank is a bank jointly organized by the silk industry and the financial sector. Its mission is to support and develop the silk industry. Therefore, there is a close relationship between the Silk Industry Bank and the silk industry. The Silk Industry Bank, in view of the depression of the silk and satin industry, of course thinks about seeking relief all the time. Today is the anniversary of the establishment of the Silk Industry Bank, so it was decided in advance to take this opportunity to do a little work for the silk and satin industry, which is to open this exhibition. At first, it was agreed to be jointly organized by the Silk and Satin Trade Association and the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association. Later, after consultation, it was considered that this matter was of great importance and could not be treated carelessly. We also asked the Municipal Chamber of Commerce National Goods Store to participate in this association, and we were honored to have the Municipal Chamber of Commerce send a letter to invite Mayor Wu to be the Honorary Chairman and Director Wu to be the Chairman, and Director Pan and others to be members. Therefore, the organization of this association was expanded. Now, the entire third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce National Goods Store has been allocated as the exhibition venue. The preparations have taken about a month, and a total of more than 60 manufacturers have participated. The press in this city also believes that national silk and satin are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so the Shen Bao, Xin Bao, Morning Post, Da Wan Bao, and Shanghai Commercial News each published special editions for three days in order to make a widespread call to the people of the country. The exhibition period of this association is only one month, but we sincerely hope that everyone can leave an impression in their minds forever, and from now on, hold the determination to promote national silk and satin, and take it as their duty to promote and carry forward the inherent glory of the silk and satin industry. Then, the value of this association will not be small.</p>
<h3>Rubber Industry Forced Back</h3>
<p>This morning, I specifically petitioned and negotiated with the Municipal Government and other institutions.</p>
<p>The Machine Federation changed the date of the meeting and submitted it to the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that since the seven factories including Yiyuan and Tianxing have been repeatedly warned to relocate by the British and French</p>
<p>Concession Authorities, the Rubber Industry Trade Association has decided to petition the Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chinese Taxpayers Association this morning, according to the resolutions of the representatives' meeting. The Machine Federation submitted a request to the Municipal Government today for negotiation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>This morning, the National Goods Rubber Industry Trade Association petitioned the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association at 10:00 this morning, according to the resolutions of the members' representatives' meeting, requesting negotiation, and appointed representatives Xue Ji, Feng Yunchu, Shen Mengshi, Shi Zhishan, Yu Xinsheng, and other five people to report the progress to the Municipal Government and other institutions, and asked for assistance.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Negotiate: The Shanghai Machine-made National Goods Factory Federation believes that this case involves factory inspections. If the Concession Authorities insist on their own way, using social tranquility as an excuse, and disregard the livelihoods of the factory and tens of thousands of workers, it will inevitably cause a huge backlash. Therefore, representative Cheng Shouchong was dispatched to negotiate the day before yesterday, but there was no result because the authorities were unreasonable. The association originally scheduled a meeting yesterday</p>
<p>to discuss countermeasures, but due to insufficient personnel, it was rescheduled to noon on the 12th at the association's meeting place to hold a supplementary meeting.</p>
<p>Document Submitted to the Municipal Government: The Machine Federation's document to the Municipal Government states: "We are hereby requesting guidance on the matter. It is learned from the letter of our member, China Yapu'er Electrical Factory, that the Yiyuan Rubber Factory on Chengdu Road was ordered to move by the Concession Authority due to housing matters, and suspended work on the first of this month, which has become a major problem for the factory's business and the livelihood of its workers. There are many national goods factories set up in the concession. Hearing the previous situation, it is inevitable that there will be anxiety. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether the factory building and civilian housing facilities of the Yiyuan Factory are in line with the principles of the factory, and whether the Concession Authority's repeated warnings are in line with the law. For this reason, we have sent a letter requesting the Standing Committee to deliberate on the handling of the matter. After investigations, in addition to Yiyuan Factory, there are also eight factories including Tianxing, Hongda, Dada, Shanghai Industrial, Zhengda, Datong, and Da Zhonghua, which have been warned or even ordered to stop work and relocate by the Public Concession Authority and the French Concession Authority. The reason they rely on is that the factory building is not suitable for manufacturing rubber factories, and the boiler equipment is incomplete, which is enough to endanger the lives and property of the people, and they are given three weeks</p>
<p>to stop work, otherwise they will file a lawsuit and exercise all powers to curb public danger. At first glance, it is indeed grand and fair, and puts human life first. I wonder if most of our national goods factories are expanded from small industries. The factory buildings are rented and the facilities are simple, which is inevitable. Once the excuse of public danger is used, there is no way to subsidize them except to stop work and close the factory. Article 40 of Chapter 8 of the Factory Law stipulates that if the competent authority finds that the safety or health equipment of the factory is incomplete, it may order it to be improved within a time limit, and in urgent cases, it may stop the use of part of it. Now it is ordered to stop work and move the factory. Is it legal? It is doubtful. Moreover, the inspection of factories is the entire labor administration of our country. The Concession Authority does not come before us, does not come after us, when we implement labor administration to improve the safety and health equipment of factories, first, it amends the Yangjingbang Regulations and obtains the inspection power, then, it uses public danger to order the factory to stop work and relocate. If the rubber factory is like this, other factories will inevitably be affected. The matter involves the future of industry and the issue of national sovereignty. Should it be accepted? There is nothing to follow. If it is accepted, the losses of the factory and the livelihood of the workers, is there no other danger hidden in the prevention of public danger by the Concession Authority? The situation is urgent. It is reasonable to report the situation and request the authorities to review it and quickly approve the measures to be followed and to ensure industrial peace. Sincerely present to the Shanghai Municipal Government,</p>
<p>All circles are actively preparing."</p>

<p>Special District Store Stamp</p>
<h3>Should Be Subsidized Uniformly</h3>
<p>(Since November 1, 1929</p>
<p>Otherwise, penalties will be imposed according to law once discovered)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Finance to stipulate the annual period and strictly limit the search and seizure of tax evasion cases in the Special District Inspection Office to avoid multiple entanglements. Yesterday, it received Approval No. 2911 from the Ministry of Finance's Tax Department, which stated, "I have read the telegram in detail. The principle that criminal law does not apply retroactively refers to acts committed before the law came into effect. The implementation of the Stamp Tax Regulations in the Shanghai Concession began on November 1, 1929. If stores do not affix stamps to the receipts and books used after the regulations came into effect, it is illegal. No matter when it is discovered, the principle of non-retroactivity does not apply. Moreover, the inspection of stamps in the concession has been implemented since the establishment of the Shanghai Office of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau on November 1, 1929. The Shanghai Special District Local Court has punished it according to regulations, with records and evidence. It is not the case that penalties were imposed only after the Cigarette Inspection Office also handled stamp inspections. It should be noted that the competent authority has not investigated and punished those who did not affix stamps for cases established before the regulations came into effect. Merchants cannot say that they should be exempt from investigation and punishment for cases established before the Inspection Office also handled it after the regulations came into effect. Moreover, cases of violating the Stamp Tax Regulations have been investigated and punished by the court according to regulations and cannot be said to be extortion. In short, stamp inspection is a necessary procedure to urge the actual affixing of stamps. If merchants can affix the full amount at any time, there will be no evidence of illegality, and there will be no fear of punishment. The leaders of the association and the merchants will surely understand this meaning. According to the previous situation in the telegram, they should still persuade the merchants that if there are receipts and books that have not been stamped and were established after the Stamp Tax Regulations came into effect, they must uniformly subsidize the full amount according to regulations to avoid investigation</p>
<p>Punishment, this is extremely important. This approval,</p>
<h3>Local News from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui leads his troops to withdraw from Chengdu</p>
<p>It is said to be to obey the central government</p>
<p>Since the conflict between the armies of Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou in Sichuan Province, it has undergone several changes. Liu Xiang, the army commander of the 21st Army, was finally appointed by the central government as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, responsible for stopping the Sichuan war. Recently, frequent telegrams have reported that the two Lius have renewed the war. The Red disaster in northern Sichuan is high, and the generals in central Sichuan are constantly arguing, which is enough to be regrettable. According to Leng Rong, the representative of the 24th Army in Shanghai, after the central government appointed Liu Xiang as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan and the decree was issued, Liu Wenhui, the army commander of the 24th Army, in order to express his obedience to the central government and stabilize the Sichuan situation, telegraphed to the central government to transfer his original position as chairman of the provincial government to facilitate unification. Recently, a telegram from Sichuan stated that the 24th Army has led its troops to withdraw from Chengdu and stationed in Xinjin County on the 7th of this month. It is expected that the 21st Army will be able to enter Chengdu sooner or later. The vanguard is rushing towards the provincial capital. The development of the Sichuan situation in the future depends on Liu Xiang's implementation of the bandit suppression plan after arriving in the province. If he can understand the central government's hard work in establishing the Sichuan situation and remember the suffering of the people of Sichuan, and because the people of Sichuan, who have been in internal war for decades, have been oppressed to the extreme and are most easily incited by bandits, all measures should be fair and selfless, so that the officers and soldiers of the entire province can cooperate to put out the emerging Red disaster. An Chuan is really not a problem.</p>
<p>Detected</p>
<h3>Trial of International Drug Organization</h3>
<p>On May 13, the United States San Francisco detected International selling</p>
<p>A large organ of narcotics, detaining the Westerner Qiao Da Aishi</p>
<p>Layin, according to the suspect's confession in the local court, the Chinese Shanghai side, hosted by the Chinese Ye Jingbo, jointly sold narcotics in a large amount. As for the goods shipped to Shanghai, the remittance was also done by Ye, who falsely set up a Dalong Tea Shop at No. 25 Yongyu Lane, Belle Road, French Concession, with Kong Yunfei as the manager. Then, in the name of the tea shop, Ye signed and remitted funds to the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank. Moreover, the Shanghai agency also had Chinese Zhuang Hanzhang, and Ye Kong were both shareholders. As for the agency's brand name, it was Ye Qinghe, etc. After learning of the major drug trafficking case in San Francisco, the French police knew that many of the accomplices in the case were hiding in the French Concession, so they immediately ordered a strict investigation to arrest the major drug traffickers. Until the 21st of last month, the police received a tip that someone secretly set up a red pill agency at No. 3, Lane 167, Annakin Road, which was related to the San Francisco case. After the police verified the report, they dispatched detectives to the scene and seized a large number of red pills and many account books. One of the books contained the name of Ye Qinghe, shareholder Zhuang Hanzhang, who was also a major shareholder of the agency. The police immediately ordered Zhuang's arrest, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. At the same time, the police received another report that No. 725 Fuxu Road and No. 8 Huanlong Villa, Huanlong Road, were important drug trafficking agencies and were related to the Annakin Road case. As a result, many account books from 1920 and 1921 of the Republic of China were seized in No. 8 Huanlong Villa. The account books contained the brand name Ye Qinghe, and all recorded the amount of drug imports and exports. The owner of the number, Yan Ziliang, was immediately taken to the police station along with the evidence, as well as the owner of No. 725 Fuxu Road, Qin Cai.</p>
<p>Nan, was also taken to the police station together. After investigation by the police, it was learned that not only were the two agencies related to Annakin Road, but they were also important figures in the San Francisco case. In addition to strictly arresting the fugitives Zhuang Hanzhang, Kong Yunfei, Ye Jingbo, etc., Qin Yan was sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Wang Gangxi interrogated him. Because the police still need to investigate, they requested a change of date. Subsequently, the court also allowed the defendants to pay cash and bail to go out and wait for the trial. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. According to Yan's confession, he was a Ningbo native, 65 years old. All the seized account books and other items belonged to the fugitive Zhou Heshang. As for Zhou, he has now hidden in Wujin, etc. Qin confessed that he was 49 years old and from Wuxi. The rest of his confession was ambiguous. Subsequently, the police requested a change of date because they still needed to arrest Zhou Heshang. The court approved it and ordered a change of date for the retrial. It is heard that the court has issued arrest warrants for Zhuang, Ye, and Kong and will arrest them and bring them to justice according to law.</p>
<p>Local Yellow Wine Production</p>
<h3>Please exempt from abolishing special photos</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association Federation yesterday telegraphed to the National Government Ministry of Finance Taxation Administration Jiangsu Stamp Tax Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, (title omitted) secretly the Association Since the Taxation Administration changed the tax rate and revised the fixed tax on local wine, the regulations stipulated in 40 articles, harsh miscellaneous, it goes without saying, have been recognized by the liquor industry merchants in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou area as difficult to implement, and they have jointly appealed to the Association to appeal for the abolition of the case. However, from the point of view of facts, most of the local yellow wine production sites in Shanghai are located in Pudong, across the river from the concessions. Most of the brewed wine is sold in the concessions. The water quality of local yellow wine is the turbid Pujiang River water, so the taste of the wine is not very delicious, and the value is due to high wages and cheap rice prices. The cost per load is only more than three yuan, so the price of the wine is relatively low. Therefore, most people of the middle and upper classes despise it and it is only welcomed by laborers in various industries. There are many factories in the concessions and thousands of workers. Our industry relies on sales. Since the opening of public sales in the fourth year of the Republic of China, the tax authorities, in view of the special circumstances and maintaining the lives of merchants and people, have made changes to the tax regulations and provided consideration, and implemented a special photo system, initially charging 12% of the value, with a tax of only six cents, and later changing it to 20% of the value, which has been increasing year by year. Up to now, it has increased to 16 cents, which is several times higher than before. Now the new tax is based on how many percent of the value, the burden on merchants and people has been increased, and the business is far worse than before due to the impact of the situation. If the full tax is levied according to the new regulations, the livelihood will be destroyed. Therefore, in order to maintain the business situation, we must resolutely request to retain the special photos to make adjustments. Moreover, the containers for local yellow wine have always been only 40 catties. Last year, in compliance with the balance system, it has been changed to 45 catties. We should request that this be the standard for the fixed amount and not increase it any further to avoid disputes. In short, the new tax should be abolished and not discussed. If it must be implemented, the special photo (that is, half tax) of our industry must not be abolished. Otherwise, our industry will only stop brewing and transporting, and stop business together. We will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. We sincerely appeal to the authorities and respectfully request your consideration. A copy of the special photo that we are willing to receive is attached as proof. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we hereby telegraphically report, Shanghai Municipal Local Yellow Wine Production Industry Association, All members of the committee, members, bowing together, Geng Yin,</p>

<p>Jiangyin Street Business Community Vegetable Vendors</p>
<h3>Request to maintain the original site of the tea market</h3>
<p>(　　　Reply: It is inconvenient to change the previous agreement</p>
<p>Merchants and tea vendors unite to carry out)</p>
<p>Jiangyin Street in the southern district of this city was deserted and sparsely populated before the 9th year of the Republic of China. Later, vegetable vendors set up a market, and after the 17th year, it became today's bustling street market, with shops and many residents. Tracing back to the origin, it is all due to the efforts of the vegetable vendors, etc. In the past year, the Shanghai Charity Group planned to build a vegetable market at the intersection of Lujiabang Road, South Railway Station Back Road, and presented it to the competent authorities for approval. After completion, the Jiangyin Street vegetable market will be moved in, and stalls will be set up by vegetable vendors through bidding. After the matter was known to the vegetable vendors and all merchants and people in Jiangyin Street, they were greatly alarmed and believed that the impact would lead to commercial bankruptcy and market depression. They specially appointed representatives to jointly request the Charity Group to cancel the construction. Later, they received a reply stating that it was inconvenient to change, etc. According to the letter, the representatives discussed the method of maintaining the original site of the vegetable market because it was related to their own interests. It was decided that (1) all merchants, people, and vegetable vendors should unite and organize the Jiangyin Street Merchants, People, and Vegetable Vendors Committee to maintain the original site of the vegetable market and start to carry out the plan; (2) oppose the new vegetable market and maintain the original site of the vegetable market. The Charity Group's reply is recorded below: "Respectfully replying, we have received and read your letter of July 2 requesting the cancellation of the construction of the Railway Station Road Vegetable Market. After the group's plan was completed, it was presented to the Social Affairs Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau for approval last year. If the merchants and stallholders have any inconveniences or have legitimate reasons to object, they should petition the government. Our group is not convenient to rashly change the previous agreement, so we reply specifically. Please note this. To all the merchants and stallholders representatives of Jiangyin Street, the Shanghai Charity Group."</p>

<p>Police officer privately makes red pills and escapes</p>
<h3>His mother is implicated and imprisoned</h3>
<p>(The mother refuses to accept and appeals)</p>
<p>Jiang Keyi, a Jiangbei native who resides at No. 1 Wen'anfang, Belle Road, French Concession, and works as a Chinese police officer No. 629 in the French Concession, recently privately manufactured red-quality poisonous pills at home. The police learned about it and sent detective Wu Lianrong to arrest him. Jiang had already fled upon hearing the news. Only his mother, Jiang Liu, and suspected accomplices, Wang Xiaozi and Wang Liu, were arrested, and several pounds of red pills and manufacturing equipment were seized in the Tongxiang room upstairs and taken to the police station, where they were sent to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer prosecuted them for the crime of manufacturing opium substitutes in violation of Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. After the trial, Jiang Liu was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined 200 yuan for assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. The red pills and equipment were confiscated. Wang Xiaozi and Wang Liu were acquitted and released. It is now learned that Jiang Liu expressed dissatisfaction with the original sentence and filed an appeal with the Jiangsu Higher Third Branch Court, citing reasons and hiring lawyer Wu Kaisheng of No. 2 Li Yuanfang, Lan Weiai Road, as his agent. The case was tried in a collegial panel by Judge Zhou, together with two judges, Guo and Fan, and the prosecutor. First, the court inquired about the appellant's reasons for dissatisfaction. Then, the appellant's defense counsel argued that the son's crime should not implicate his mother. Moreover, the manufacturing facility was located upstairs, and the appellant lived downstairs. The appellant naturally did not know the details of what he was doing upstairs. The original sentence should be revoked and the appellant should be declared innocent, etc. After deliberation, the court declared the argument closed and waited for the scheduled sentencing. The appellant was still remanded in custody to await trial.</p>
<p>11,000 Yuan Robbery Case</p>
<h3>The Detective Team Has Apprehended a Suspect</h3>
<p>At 2:10 p.m. on the 28th of last month, a robbery occurred at the entrance of Yong'an Lane, Gualu Street, South City, where the escort Song Boqing and others from the South City Office of the Bank of China were carrying 11,000 yuan in silver dollars in the car.

Zhu Ronghai was unable to avoid it and was immediately knocked down and injured. He was sent to the hospital but died. The case was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the deceased's father, Zhu Chunjin, has only one son to rely on for life. Now that he has died tragically, how can he live? Moreover, he is unable to afford to collect the body. Therefore, at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, he went to the Xieqiao Barber Association in South City to request assistance in negotiations and relief. After receiving the report, the association sent members Li Yongcheng and Rong Guangren to investigate. The deceased's father, Zhu Chunjin, is now 71 years old and has only one son to rely on for life. The situation is very tragic. The association should provide assistance.

<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>A Major Innovation in Domestic Bed Industry: Siemens Bed Factory at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Guangxi Road, noting that the paint on domestic steel beds becomes dark and dull after only a few months, either rusting or peeling off, which is both economically damaging and aesthetically unpleasing, causing domestic product enthusiasts to feel disappointed. If this continues, the future of the domestic bed industry will be greatly affected. In view of this, the factory has specially imported a full set of spray painting machines from Germany. The beds painted are incredibly smooth and can last for several years without fading, surpassing imported products. This is truly good news for the future of domestic products.</p>
<p>Clean Brand Ink Remover Launched by the Chemistry Department of the Zhonghua Machinery Factory: After a long period of refining, the Chemistry Department of the Zhonghua Machinery Factory has produced a Clean Brand Ink Remover.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding a news item in today's paper stating that our store sells enemy goods such as silk fabrics. This is merely one-sided propaganda and does not correspond to the facts. Our Pacific Pharmacy was founded by Kunhua personally and has been operating diligently for fourteen years. We have had many dealings with your newspaper in the past, and I believe you are aware of everything. Because our products are numerous and inexpensive, patriotic groups mistakenly believe that our exports are enemy goods disguised and have issued warnings. To avoid misunderstandings, we have displayed the origin of the raw materials, manufacturing methods, and cans of our various products in the large window of our sales department. I am writing to inform you of this and to wish you peace.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Tu Kunhua</p>
<p>To the esteemed Chief Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding an item published in today's "Local News" column entitled "The Largest Morphine and Red Pill Organization in the French Concession," which stated that the main culprit was Zhang Zonghan from Ningbo. I have always been engaged in legitimate business and can be investigated. The matter concerns the manufacturing of poisonous pills, which is a serious matter, and the crime is not light. Since I have not participated in this illegal business, I cannot allow others to call a deer a horse. The report in your newspaper is likely based on inaccurate rumors. Since the case has been sent to court, the truth will eventually come to light. I am urgently writing to clarify the matter and request that your newspaper promptly correct the report in order to reflect the truth and maintain its reputation. This is my sincere request. Respectfully, Zhang Zonghan, July 9th.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Regulations for Vocational Schools and Secondary School Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a request from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to interpret "equivalent level" in the regulations for vocational schools and "equivalent academic ability" in the secondary school law, recently instructed the department as follows: "We have received your request. Upon review, the phrase 'equivalent level' in Articles 6 and 7 of the Ministry's Regulations for Vocational Schools refers separately to those who have not formally graduated from elementary school or junior high school but have an equivalent level in academic subjects related to the occupation they are studying. This differs slightly from the 'equivalent academic ability' in Article 11 of the Secondary School Law, which refers to an equivalent academic ability in all subjects as those who have graduated from elementary school or junior high school. Furthermore, the age range of 12 to 20 years old in Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Regulations for Vocational Schools cited in the original request should be 15 to 22 years old. You are instructed to be informed of this and to inform others."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Issuance of Jiangxi Inspection Report</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education yesterday issued an order to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education regarding the report by supervisors Zhong Daozan and section chief Zhong Jianxiu on their previous joint inspection of education in Jiangxi. The report concerned areas in schools and social education that should be improved, and they were instructed to comply and report back.</p>
<h3>Anhui Department of Education Appoints New Principals and Staff</h3>
<p>The Anhui Department of Education recently appointed new staff within the department and local educational administrators as follows: Zhang Sangyun as the head of the Second Section of the department, Wang Junsheng as the provincial supervisor, Zhang Baoying as the chief clerk, Zheng Guoshi, Zhou Hanfu, and Wang Ruochen as appointed secretaries, Teng Dachun, Zhong Xinghong, Si Pu, Yu Zunshan, Si Ruixia, Yang Dashi, Tao Jue, Zhou Zhihua, Ye Shenzhi, Wang Pingxi, Wang Chongyu, and Cheng Husheng as clerks, Li Jintang as the head of the Yu Tai People’s Education Center, Yang Yun as the head of the Su County People’s Education Center, Chen Xiaomin as the inspector of Woyang County, Ye Shouji as the principal of Shou County Junior High School, Zhang Jihe on trial as the director of the Jixi Education Bureau, and Yan Dan as the head of the Fanchang People’s Education Center.

Sun Wenyuan, principal of Fifth High School, was transferred to be principal of the high school, and Liu Qi (from Jiangxi, a graduate of Peking University) was appointed to fill the vacancy left by the Fifth High School principal. Li Qingsong, the current director of academic affairs at First High School, was appointed as the head of First High School. Sun is from Tongcheng, and Li is from Hefei.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Will Deal Strictly with Peking University Student Unrest</h3>
<p>(President Yan of the Academy of Arts Resigns, Student Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition)</p>
<p>(Xu Songming Arrives in Tianjin and States He Will Never Take Over the High School by Force)</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) The student unrest at Peiping University appears to be expanding on the surface, but in reality, after a considerable period of time, there will be considerable measures taken. The Ministry of Education has adopted a firm resolution regarding the actions of the students. The academic atmosphere will be absolutely rectified, and the Ministry's orders will inevitably be implemented. Acting President Xu Songming arrived in Tianjin today (the 8th) and will stay for a few days to consider implementing the Ministry's orders. On the student side, they are still actively protecting the school, with the high school being the most enthusiastic. The details of each party are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Ministry of Education: Huang Ying, from the educational sector who came to Peiping from Beijing today (the 8th), stated that the Ministry of Education will first take a peaceful attitude towards the Peiping University student unrest to make the young students aware. If the students insist on their demands, the Ministry will implement its policy of rectifying the academic atmosphere, preventing students from taking actions outside the bounds of the law. The Peiping Student Union will jointly petition the government in Beijing with students from various schools. The Ministry of Education is paying close attention to this. The change of the Peiping University Academy of Arts to a vocational school and the closure of the high school are inevitable and cannot be reversed. If the students go to Beijing, it will be ineffective. Regardless of whether the students are in Peiping or going to Beijing, if there are no actions outside the bounds of the law, then it is fine. If there are actions outside the bounds of the law, there will be severe sanctions. If students at a certain academy cause trouble, then the academy will be disbanded. After disbanding, a reorganization committee will be formed, and faculty and staff will be re-hired separately, and students will be re-examined. This is the Ministry of Education's planned approach. The Peiping University High School is located inside Yunliao Gate in Zhonghai, Peiping, close to the residences of Committee Member He of the Military Sub-Committee and Committee Member Huang of the Political Consolidation Committee. If students take special actions, it would be like throwing themselves into a trap. As for the issue of high school students transferring schools, the Ministry of Education and President Xu are absolutely responsible.</p>
<p>Xu Songming Discusses Measures: Peiping University Acting President Xu Songming arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM today (the 8th). Reporters spoke with Xu over the long-distance telephone, and he said the following: The measures stipulated in the Ministry of Education's instructions are a framework. The detailed implementation steps are still under consideration. After the Academy of Arts is closed, it must still be changed to a vocational school. After the high school is closed, all students will transfer schools, and professors will also transfer to teach elsewhere. As for the high school students who have misunderstood the rumors, I don't mind. I have always advocated peace towards people, and of course, I cannot end the high school by force. In the future, the Ministry of Education will send personnel to Peiping to handle all closure matters. Unpaid salaries of faculty and staff after the closure of the Academy of Arts and High School will be cleared on a monthly basis. Whether the High School Affiliated to the Normal University and the High School Affiliated to Kongde College can accommodate all the high school students is pending negotiation with Peiping University after I arrive in Peiping, and Peiping University can subsidize expenses.</p>
<p>President Yan Resigns Again: Academy of Arts President Yan Zhikai resigned once last year due to the thorny issue of changing to a vocational school. He was reinstated after being retained by faculty, staff, and students. Now, because of the unsuccessful negotiations in Beijing, he has again resigned to President Xu. Xu then retained him. At the same time, Yan sent a telegram from Hangzhou to the staff of the academy in Peiping, stating that he had resigned to President Xu and that all departments should prepare for handover as soon as possible. Secretary Li Binyu of the academy specially convened a meeting of academy affairs on the evening of the 7th and decided to retain Yan. Professors also expressed their opinions on the change to a vocational school. Student representatives left Peiping today (the 8th) to petition in Beijing.</p>
<p>Academy of Arts Affairs Meeting: The Academy of Arts held an academy affairs meeting at the Rongyuan Restaurant on the evening of the 7th. Committee members Li Binyu, Ding Naigang, Shen Liyuan, Wei Tianlin, Zhou Yang'an, Ling Wenyuan, and Yang Zhongzi attended and passed the following resolutions: ㈠ Allocation of June expenses. ㈡ President Yan's resignation, decision to retain. During the meeting, student representatives Zhu Chongzhi and Liu Jiaxiang reported the significance of going south to petition. Faculty and staff all signed and donated salaries to support the travel expenses of the student representatives and adjourned around 10:00 PM. After the meeting, a telegram was sent to retain President Yan. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To President Yan Zhikai, transferred by Principal Xu Shiyou, No. 7, Lane 1, Siwei Lane, Chengtou Street, Hangzhou. We have received your telegram. Please continue your efforts. The colleagues unanimously support. The Academy of Arts Affairs Meeting respectfully.</p>
<p>Professor Ding Naigang Discusses the Academy of Arts: Professor Ding Naigang said that the issue of our academy's change to a vocational school has not yet been resolved. From the perspective of the professors, we believe that if the Ministry of Education wants to change it to a vocational school, it should be done quickly to avoid interrupting art education. At the same time, we also hope that the Ministry of Education will complete the students' studies. If certificates are issued, but the courses have not been completed, then even with certificates, they will be useless. Those who serve in society and study art must have ability and cannot muddle through. If the students have not completed their studies, then their future is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Student Representatives Go South: Student representatives Liu Jiaxiang and Zhu Chongzhi took the Pingpu train to Beijing at 5:15 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. Before leaving, the two representatives made the following statement to reporters: The students of our academy do not oppose the change to a vocational school, nor do they oppose the Ministry's orders, as long as the students' studies are taken into account. If the students have a future, then we can barely accept it. The tasks of this trip to Beijing are fourfold: ㈠ Explain the students' difficulties to the Ministry of Education and request to maintain the students' studies. ㈡ If the Ministry of Education must close our academy, request the Ministry to find other ways to advance the students' studies. ㈢ In addition to petitioning the Ministry of Education, we plan to go to the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan to lament. ㈣ We hope that the central government will give a whole new approach to the serious situation of education in North China. As for the issue of the students' studies after the closure of the art school, we will especially bring it to the Ministry of Education's attention. In short, the sole purpose of this petition is to seek to maintain the students' studies and has no other tasks.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association Was Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Assembly Representative Chu Minyi Attended and Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>Chen Bai Elected Executive Committee Member, Pan Gongzhan Elected Supervisory Committee Member, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association held its inaugural meeting at the auditorium of the Municipal Education Bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday, elected the first Executive and Supervisory Committee members, and passed the organizational charter. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees: In addition to General Assembly Representative Chu Minyi, Municipal Party Department Representative Zhu Jiaxiang, and Municipal Education Bureau Representative Yao Gengkui, the following members attended: Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Zheng Zhengqiu, Yang Minshi, Lu Shibai, Chen Bai, Zhou Feicheng, Shen Junru, Zhou Shang, Xu Wancheng, Shen Lizhi, Hu Xiongfei, Xu Gongmei, Dai Ce, Chen Dabei, Hu Shuyi, Cao Huiqun, Shao Xunmei, Xie Shoukang, Li Denghui, Zhang Yongchun, Zhou Jianyun, Cheng Bugao, Gao Qianping, Li Zhaohuan, Li Dachao, Ye Gongchuo, Hong Shen, Wang Xiaoying, Chen Yumei, Yang Jingyi, Shao Zuiweng, Gao Tianqi, Xie Zhaochang, Wang Qianbai, Guo Youshou, Gao Lihen, Gu Yinqian, and over a hundred others.</p>
<p>Establishment: The meeting opened at 2:00 PM. The presidium consisted of Pan Gongzhan, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Chen Bai. Students from the Bingxun Shorthand School served as recorders. After performing the formalities, Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu reported on the preparatory process, followed by a speech by General Assembly Representative Chu Minyi. Municipal Party Department Representative Zhu Jiaxiang and Municipal Education Bureau Representative Yao Gengkui also gave speeches in succession. The organizational charter was then passed, and the first Executive and Supervisory Committee members were elected. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM after a group photo.</p>
<p>Chu's Speech: Chu Minyi's speech briefly stated: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association. I am here as a representative of the General Assembly to participate. I hope that branches can be established in various places in the future to promote the development of the film industry and put it on the right path. Currently, the power of film is very great. I have a proposal in the Central Standing Committee that the film industry must be managed by a specialized organization. There are three major forces in society: the first is schools, which give young people knowledge and skills to advance society; the second is newspapers, which represent public opinion and improve society; and the third is film, whose power is even greater than that of schools and newspapers. The invention of film is based on photography. Initially, it was only a toy, such as magic lantern slides. Today, film has become a product of the new era, just like the gramophone and radio. It has evolved from a toy into an educational tool. In China, where the majority of the population is illiterate, film is a powerful tool for promoting education and popularizing education. Its effectiveness is greater than that of textbooks. Not only is this true for education, but the Three Principles of the People and all construction policies can also be promoted through film. For example, the central government and various regions have very comprehensive national construction plans, but the reason why they cannot be implemented immediately is that the majority of people are illiterate, and propaganda cannot penetrate the grassroots. Film can make even illiterate people understand, and since the invention of sound film, it can make people understand even more. Therefore, various undertakings can utilize film. However, to run a large-scale educational film business, capital of tens of millions is needed. Various films are produced, and ships are used in the south and cars are used in the north to screen them in rural areas. If this is done for a year, the public's level of knowledge will be easily improved. The central government has decided to hand this case over to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education. The film industry, which is short of capital, can also start operating in the shortest possible time. With the establishment of the Shanghai Branch, I hope that everyone will first compile materials, second, produce films, and third, promote them in society. In the future, textbooks in elementary schools can be completely replaced by films, which are more effective than books. In China, which is currently very poor and weak, those who are interested in educational films should gather their strength, unite as one, and eliminate the current improper obscene and violent films. We firmly believe that positive construction is more effective than negative suppression.</p>
<p>Speeches by Representatives: Municipal Party Department Representative Zhu Jiaxiang's speech briefly stated: "The Chinese have always regarded film as entertainment and neglected its value in education. The essence of film is art, a comprehensive art that can penetrate people's hearts. Radio broadcasting already has great value in education, but radio broadcasting only satisfies hearing, and its effectiveness is definitely not as great as that of film. Moreover, film is also quite economical. I hope that all comrades will use film as a tool to promote education and eliminate illiteracy in China." Next, Municipal Education Bureau Representative Yao Gengkui said: "Film has been used as an educational tool for a long time, but generally people don't pay much attention to it. In fact, any kind of film has educational effects, only with the difference between good and bad reactions. As for film replacing textbooks, a certain university in England has experimented with it, and the results show that using film instead of books can reduce the time by two-thirds. In China today, on the one hand, we should use film to implement education, and on the other hand, we must ensure that all films have good educational effects, and the latter is more urgently needed than the former."</p>
<p>Preparatory Process: Zheng Zhengqiu reported on the preparatory process, briefly stating that the Chinese Educational Film Association was initiated and organized last year by Mr. Chu Minyi, Duan Xipeng, Guo Youshou, and Peng Baichuan. Since its establishment, it has been working tirelessly, shining a ray of light on the Chinese educational film industry. In order to assist the General Assembly in implementing film education, the initiators Pan Gongzhan, Chen Heqin, Zheng Zhengqiu, Chen Bai, Dai Ce, Gao Huai, Lu Shibai, and Yang Minshi initiated the organization of the Shanghai Branch. After approval from the General Assembly and with the endorsement of over thirty initiators, including Li Zhaohuan and Zheng Hongnian, Zheng Zhengqiu, Chen Bai, Ren Jinpin, Lu Shibai, and Yang Minshi were appointed as preparatory members and formed a preparatory committee to draft the charter and submit it to the Municipal Party Department for approval and to the Education Bureau for record. Today it is formally established.</p>
<p>Election Results: The elected Executive Committee members are Chen Bai, Yang Minshi, Lu Shibai, Tao Baichuan, and Chen Heqin. The alternate Executive Committee members are Xu Gongmei, Yao Suhong, and Shao Zuiweng. The elected Supervisory Committee members are Pan Gongzhan, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Wu Kaixian.

<p>Wimbledon Tennis Concludes</p>
<h3>Mrs. Mallory Wins for Sixth Consecutive Year</h3>
<p>Defeats Miss Londe of England 2-1</p>
<p>Unfair Refereeing Occurred in the Second Set</p>
<p>Borotra and Lacoste Win Men's Doubles Championship</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, August 8) Today's Wimbledon women's singles final was the most intense since the days of Madame Lenglen of France. Mrs. Mallory of the United States defeated Miss Londe of England 6-4, 6-8, 6-3, retaining her championship for the sixth consecutive year. All other championship categories have also been decided, and this year's Wimbledon has come to a close.</p>
<h3>Dispute in the Women's Singles Final</h3>
<p>The final between Mrs. Mallory and Miss Londe saw an unfortunate incident unprecedented at Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Unfair linesman. In the second set, Londe led 7-6. In the next game, Mallory, after deuce, needed one more point to win the game. Londe hit a shot that landed outside the baseline, but the umpire marked it as 7-7. At this moment, the linesman stood up and corrected the umpire's decision. After some hesitation, the umpire reversed his decision, counting the game as deuce. Londe then served again, and Mallory, greatly shaken, lost two points in a row, and Londe won 8-6.</p>
<p>Spectators voice discontent. The spectators then voiced their discontent for Mallory, cheering her on. In the first set, Mallory's strokes were rather ordinary, and her shots were not faster than Londe's. Londe's groundstrokes were impressive, but she missed many opportunities for winning smashes at the net. Londe took a 3-2 lead, Mallory tied it 3-3, then 4-4, and won 6-4.</p>
<p>Londe has definitely improved. In the second set, Londe showed significant improvement, with both long and short shots being exceptionally impressive. Her passing shots in particular scored many points. In the third set, Londe's performance plummeted, far below the standard before the incident in the second set. After two games each, Mallory won three consecutive games, taking a 5-2 lead. In the final game, when Mallory needed only one point, Londe hit a drop shot. Mallory countered with a drive, and Londe rushed forward for a smash, which was remarkably brilliant, saving a game. In the ninth game, Mallory led 40-15.</p>
<p>occupying the lead, Londe's final shot hit the net and lost.</p>

<h3>France Appoints Lacoste as Captain</h3>
<p>The strength of the French Davis Cup team this year seems to be less than in previous years, but in order to maintain its dominance, it has specially appointed former world tennis champion Mr. Lacoste as captain (the team captain does not participate in the matches, and it is equivalent to managing or guiding).

<h3>Grand Departure of Shandong Athletes</h3>
<p>(Jinan Communication) The athletes from this province participating in the 17th North China Games departed for Qingdao this morning. Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, out of consideration, specially dispatched a special train to transport them, consisting of five carriages in total. The senior male and martial arts teams shared a carriage, while the junior male, female, staff, prizes, and luggage each occupied a carriage. Chairman Han originally intended to go to Qingdao to participate, but due to his busy schedule, he was unable to go and instead sent the Director of Education, He Siyuan, to represent him. Starting at 5:00 AM this morning, athletes and staff gradually arrived at the station. The scheduled departure time was 6:00 AM, but due to the late arrival of many female athletes, it was delayed until 7:00 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Athletes' Impressions. At this congress, the Shandong team is confident in the women's championship, so the general female athletes are particularly motivated. Jumping queen Zhu Tianzhen, sprint stars Yu Xiulan, Yin Sujie, Zhang Sujing, and others arrived very early. On the platform, running east and west, a group of joy, the mother and sisters of each female athlete went to see off. The Shanghai flower queen Yang Ye, also went to the station with her mother to send her sister Yang Huan, which aroused the attention of the general. The female athletes wore either cheongsams or white jackets and blue skirts with different patterns. Most of the male athletes wore short clothes, but Wan Mi Jian will Ma Housheng, because of the treatment of legs in Jinan, must postpone the trip, wearing earth-colored silk shirt to the station to see off.</p>
<p>Roll call and departure. At 6:45, the general leader Shang Shumei, took the roll call under the car, and the athletes must stick out their heads from the car window to respond to avoid omission. After the roll call, they boarded the car, and with a whistle, the car drove east, and the senders inevitably had someone mixed among them, although only a small number of days, also inevitably sadly injured, with a towel to wipe tears, there were many people.

Bao Laigeng said that only wrestling in martial arts has a chance for a championship. Baoding, Hebei, is the birthplace of martial arts in our country, so there should be capable people. If this province can beat Hebei, then there is hope for a championship.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Spring and Autumn Chinese Domestic Silk</p>
<h3>Promoting Domestic Silk from a Broad Perspective</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>While writing this promotional piece, I feel deeply sorry for myself. Amidst the fierce battles of international capitalism, only our ancient Eastern nation still needs to shout the slogan "Promote domestic goods," and is even actively promoting it. Because people covet foreign goods; or domestic goods cannot replace and must use foreign goods; this backwardness in production is already shameful enough! But even worse is the fact that during the war when Chinese soldiers are fighting to the death with the Japanese, secret trading by treacherous merchants is being discovered in commercial cities across the country!</p>
<p>In my view, the meaning of promoting domestic goods is truly pathetic. Why don't we loudly shout "Resist foreign goods"?</p>
<p>Here, everyone understands that the Chinese people forever hold onto their characteristics of laziness, seeking petty advantages, and making do. If they make any progress, it's only through imitating counterfeits, using various techniques to deceive and pursue their own interests. Therefore, apart from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other commercial ports where you can actually see factory chimneys, the interior of the country still lives the life of 18th-century handicrafts. Monkey-brained merchants take this opportunity to peddle foreign goods, pushing them from the cities to the countryside, precisely because they exploit the "fashionable ideas" that coexist with the Chinese national characteristic of laziness, holding their heads high, they transfer rural wealth to the cities year after year through the hands of merchants, and then transfer it abroad. In our hometown, there is simply no household without Japanese toys, porcelain, flower-branded shirts, and Sheng Xiansheng cigarettes. Even illiterate old men in rural teahouses are playing with "poker"!</p>
<p>Due to the cultivation of dependent habits, the creativity of mankind has been buried. However, since one cannot simply not live, the "foreign-oriented" nature of using foreign goods immediately spread throughout China like an infectious disease.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the government, which takes people's taxes as a natural duty, seemingly has not taken care to protect commerce and maintain the foundation of an agricultural and industrial nation due to internal shadows; it has never weighed the option of raising tariff barriers or refusing imports at any time, causing cheap domestic goods to lose their sales to even cheaper foreign goods, as in the recent loan of cotton and wheat to the United States. You must know that domestic wheat is worth only two yuan and twenty or thirty cents per dan, while American wheat is worth five yuan and forty cents; which one is expensive? Which one is cheap?</p>
<p>For this reason, profit-seeking merchants have colluded with the wealthy and powerful, going abroad to purchase originally unsalable surplus goods. Therefore, amidst the clamor to resist Japanese goods, a large batch of enemy goods are still shipped into Chinese coasts, stored in large warehouses!</p>
<p>In this situation, I ask, is it possible to "resist foreign goods"? It seems that China, outwardly bound by unequal treaties and inwardly plagued by years of natural disasters and wars, is desperate for everything! Everything is being destroyed! Why only domestic goods?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say: Promoting domestic goods is actually pathetic. Which country is loudly shouting "Promote domestic goods"? Is "Promoting domestic goods" a glorious movement? If domestic goods factories do not seek excellence but only rely on "Promoting domestic goods" to make money, to fill the pockets of the petty bourgeoisie, should that be forgiven? Furthermore, shouldn't the corrupt speculative merchants who pass off foreign goods as domestic goods, especially silk, be investigated?</p>
<p>Finally, allow me to ask: Is "Promoting domestic goods" only the business of merchants?</p>
<p>Design and manufacture various fashionable clothes, display them in shop windows, make visitors better understand their personal clothing needs, and encourage them to have the courage and determination to buy domestic silk.</p>
<p>Exhibitions are temporary. The most important issue, based on the experience gained from the exhibitions and the awareness they bring, is how to expand the sales of domestic silk and reduce costs. I, being inadequate, offer my humble opinion and hope that domestic silk factories will consider and adopt it. If you want to thoroughly understand the details, please join the China Silk Association to discuss it together.</p>
<p>㈠ Establish a Joint Office</p>
<p>㈠ Pool resources ㈡ Research and improve weaving ㈢ Strive to promote sales ㈣ Develop foreign trade ㈤ Joint printing and dyeing</p>
<p>㈡ Change from Woven Patterns to Printed Patterns</p>
<p>Weaving patterns involves numerous procedures and has higher manufacturing costs. If consumer preferences change too quickly, it is difficult for factories to reform, which leads to inventory accumulation, increased costs, and inflexible finances, which greatly affects the development of domestic silk. At a time when the domestic printing and dyeing industry is developing, the silk industry should plan to establish large-scale printing and dyeing factories. Small factories should specialize in weaving white cloth, which would then be sent to printing and dyeing factories for printing and dyeing. This would free small factories from printing and dyeing concerns, and assign a portion of the responsibility to the printing and dyeing factories, which can hire specialized designers. The printing and dyeing factories would be fully responsible for colors and patterns, which would achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>㈢ Market Forecasting</p>
<p>㈠ Base operations on past trends, current domestic economic conditions, and the political situation to determine future measures for silk production, such as planning next year's operations this year. ㈡ Patterns. Determine the future styles of domestic silk based on the recent trends in European and American silk and cotton fabrics and the psychological preferences of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>㈣ Standardize Products</p>
<p>Silk products have many patterns, and it is not possible to cater to the psychological preferences of all customers with every pattern. To save on cost interest and avoid idle inventory, production should be standardized. However, this requires statistics on sales in recent years, selecting the items with the highest and most balanced sales volume to set as standards, and then standardize weaving, which will naturally reduce costs.</p>
<h3>Last Year Rayon, This Year People Will Die</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Dai</p>
<p>One day, I went to the home of my friend Mr. Wang and saw a new face. She was about eighteen or nineteen years old, wearing a silk dress as rotten as mulberry bark paper. I inquired and learned that she was a newly added maid in his house, named Xiuying.</p>
<p>I chatted with Xiuying and learned that she was a peasant from a town in Hubei. She was twenty-one years old this year and farmed for a living. She had a mother and an older brother. Now, because of the difficulty of making a living, she had come to Shanghai to work as a maid.</p>
<p>"Why is the countryside in such a state?" I asked her. "Those who raise silkworms, in the past, raising four batches of silkworms could feed them for a year. Farming was only to get some rice for food. But last year, none of the cocoons could be sold. We owed money for mulberry leaves. My mother had no choice but to mortgage our three and a half acres of rice paddy to others."</p>
<p>I listened to her words and nodded, sizing her up from head to toe. I felt that this dress of hers was inappropriate.</p>
<p>"Is the dress you are wearing given to you by the young mistress of this house?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you farming people wear cloth clothes?"</p>
<p>I was puzzled.</p>
<p>"Sir!" She seemed to find my ignorance amusing: "This is rayon, it's very cheap. I made it the year before last. All the girls in our village, front and back, bought rayon cloth to make it."</p>
<p>When I heard this, I felt very unhappy:</p>
<p>"In that case, you made this rayon dress the year before last, and the next year you had no food to eat?"</p>
<p>She looked at me very strangely, as if wearing clothes and eating were completely separate matters.</p>
<p>"You people who raise silkworms are all wearing rayon, no wonder no one wants the cocoons!" I said.</p>
<p>She seemed to think that my words were incomprehensible:</p>
<p>"No! The rayon cloth is sold in silk shops, and the cocoons are bought by the customers."</p>
<p>I ignored her and said to myself:</p>
<p>"Last year rayon, this year people will die!"</p>
<h3>The Silk Exhibition Begins</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yi</p>
<p>This year, people call it the year of domestic goods, brocades and silks compete in splendor, every man should be responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, and take promoting and publicizing it as his duty. New styles, surpassing clouds and smoke, colorful and varied, once gathered in the port of Shanghai, a grand exhibition of all kinds of colors. The Chamber of Commerce exhibition lasts for three days, there are a few famous ladies from the East, there are a few families with two hectares of land in the South Mountains; there are a few revolutionary youth with eager hearts; there are a few talented scholars with learned bellies. Upon hearing of such a grand event that is said to be rare, they come in pairs, hand in hand, naturally praising the event as unprecedented. If everyone buys a bolt to take home, the weak daughters and beloved wives will be overjoyed; if everyone makes a suit to wear, European and American wool will be worthless. You should know that being able to save economic rights and prevent foreign overflow means avoiding the suffering of eating bitter melon year after year, and avoiding the extra frills.</p>
<h3>National Silk Exhibition and the Rationalization of the Future of National Silk (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Shouchong</p>
<p>**(2) Fashion Design**</p>
<p>The significance of the National Silk Exhibition is as stated above. We must take our work a step further. Hire experts to design and manufacture various fashions, display them in showcases, so that viewers can increase their knowledge of clothing that is closely related to them, and especially to encourage their courage and determination to purchase domestic silk.</p>
<p>Exhibitions are temporary in nature. The most important issue is development, based on the experience gained from the exhibition and the appropriate awareness. I humbly offer my humble opinions and hope that national silk factories will consider and adopt them. If you want to thoroughly understand the detailed methods, I hope to join the Machinery Industry Association and discuss them together.</p>
<p>(1) Organize a Joint Office</p>
<p>(1) Concentrate Resources (2) Research and Improve Weaving (3) Strive to Promote Sales (4) Develop Foreign Trade (5) Joint Printing and Dyeing</p>
<p>(2) Change Woven Patterns to Printed Patterns</p>
<p>Weaving patterns involves numerous procedures and higher manufacturing costs. If customer preferences change too quickly, it is not easy for the factory to reform, resulting in inventory accumulation, increased costs, and inflexible financing, which greatly affects the progress of national silk. At a time when the domestic printing and dyeing industry is developed, the silk industry should plan to establish large-scale printing and dyeing factories. Small factories specialize in weaving white fabric, which is then transported to printing and dyeing factories for printing and dyeing. This way, small factories can avoid the trouble of printing and dyeing, assigning part of the responsibility to the printing and dyeing factories. The printing and dyeing factories can hire specialized design talents, with the printing and dyeing factories taking full responsibility for colors, patterns, etc., so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. (3) Market Forecasting</p>
<p>(1) Business: Based on the past years' state, the recent domestic economic situation, and the political situation, determine future measures for silk production, such as planning next year's business this year. (2) Patterns: Determine the future styles of national silk based on the recent trends in European and American silk and cotton fabric patterns and the preferences of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>(4) Standardization of Products</p>
<p>Silk products have many patterns and cannot cater to the psychology of all customers. In order to save costs and interest, and avoid the accumulation of inventory, the products should be standardized. However, this requires statistics on sales in recent years, selecting the ones with the largest and most balanced sales volume as the standard, and then standardizing the weaving to reduce costs, which is naturally within reach.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Bowing Heads to Promise Marriage, Hearts Full of Affection</p>
<p>Caring for Soldiers, Joyful and Cheerful</p>
<p>Gui Zhi felt a little embarrassed when she heard this. However, as a guest in someone's home, there was nowhere else to go, so she turned her head to look at the calendar pin-up on the wall. Madam Jiang took a puff of smoke, nodded and said, "This is true. I never thought..." She couldn't finish her sentence, and took another puff from her water pipe. Seeing that Gui Zhi's head had not yet turned back, she leisurely said, "To be honest with you..." He wanted to smoke, and seeing that the paper coal held under the tobacco pouch in his left hand had small sparks, he rubbed the paper coal with two fingers of his right hand, looking at the smoke on the paper coal and slowly replied, "In this day and age, there's been a lot of reform. Marriage matters can't be entirely decided by parents. Is there anything I don't understand? So, when someone mentions my child's marriage, I never dare to agree immediately. Actually, the Zhao family is a very good match. " As she spoke, she started to puff on her water pipe again. Madam Huang smiled and said, "So, you're willing. What about the eldest daughter? Will you let us drink this bowl of winter melon soup?" Gui Zhi looked at the pin-up on the wall, just staring without turning her head. Madam Huang said, "I'll tell you the truth. The Zhao family is sincere in wanting to pursue this marriage. Old Master Zhao personally came to our teacher and asked him to help make this happen. We originally thought of going to your residence to propose, but since you two families live together, it's a bit awkward for us to say anything. So, we invited you mother and daughter to come to the city for a visit, and by the way, talk about this matter with you mother and daughter. If you think it's worth discussing, we'll continue. If not, it doesn't matter. Fortunately, we're talking here, and no one will hear us. We matchmakers are different from ordinary matchmakers. We don't need to lie at all. You know more about the Zhao family than we do." Madam Jiang said, "Madam Huang, you're too kind. Why would you lie? I told you, I don't have anything to say." Madam Huang said, "Eldest daughter, this is a major life event. Say something. We're all women. What's the harm in saying something?" Jiang Manying stepped forward and took Gui Zhi's hand, saying, "What are you looking at that painting for?" (125)</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's publication "American Asia Beauty Garment Cutting Method," the character 縵 was mistakenly written as 綬. It should be corrected immediately.</p>
<h3>Clothes Make the Man</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>"Clothes make the man" is an old saying, and it's timeless. Since "when the leaves have fallen, then put on clothes," this old saying has been established. Suzhou people are relatively willing to put in some effort on clothing. Even though food, housing, and transportation are difficult, clothing cannot be careless. There are two folk rhymes about food and housing, called "wearing silk on your body, warming a fire pomegranate at home." Fire pomegranate refers to a portable stove, meaning it mocks those people whose clothes are very elaborate, but they completely ignore their family's finances, in other words, "starving to death is a small matter, appearance is a big deal." This Suzhou philosophy of life directly and indirectly created the status of "Suzhou satin," and "silk reeling" and "weaving machines" became Suzhou's largest handicrafts. Even childhood toys were molded into "silk reeling girls," and silk threads were put on paper kites. All of this proves the prosperity of Suzhou's silk industry in the past.</p>
<p>But now it's very different! The machine workers' residential area in the east of Suzhou City is desolate and lifeless. "Accounting houses" and "silk shops" barely survive, watching Paris, New York, Tokyo, and even India, transport colorful silks and woolens over, putting them one by one on Suzhou people. Although they maintain the spirit of the Suzhou philosophy of life, the two major handicrafts of silk reeling and weaving machines have been greatly impacted. Everyone likes foreign goods. Let me tell you a foreign story. My friend Wei Fu wrote a passage for the Coral Half-Monthly magazine:</p>
<p>I remember when I was in the United States, a German classmate complained that he had no cigarettes to smoke. We told him that they were readily available everywhere. He replied solemnly, "But none of them are German goods!" Later, in France, I met a British professor who asked me to accompany him to buy leather shoes. We walked past many good shoe stores, but he turned a blind eye to them. Later, we went to a small store, and he happily went in and bought a pair. I also went in and found that this shoe store was opened by a Scotsman. After they made the deal, I smiled and asked the professor, "Are you boycotting our national goods?" He smiled and said, "No! No! Buying British goods is just our habit." What are the readers' thoughts after reading this story? To put it angrily, Chinese people buying foreign goods has almost become a habit.</p>
<p>I really don't understand how the Chinese people's minds have changed so quickly. The concept of "foreign devils" is less than forty years away (counting from the Boxer Rebellion), and everything has been transformed into "admiring foreigners." Speaking of domestic silk, it has been greatly improved in recent years, and whether it's the luster, color, or national paintings, it is indeed better than foreign goods. Why do people still buy foreign silk that is not necessarily better than domestic silk? And speaking of value, domestic goods are cheaper. In today's world, where the collapse of the rural economy has spread to the middle class, we should especially consider purchasing power. Is it really going to be "wearing foreign silk on your body, warming a fire pomegranate at home?"</p>
<p>Based on our personal experience, using domestic silk for clothing is really cost-effective. In the past two years, the price of silk has been about the same as the price of cloth, and some foreign cloths are even more expensive than domestic goods. Summer clothes are even more suitable. I don't understand why many friends still wear white serge or flannel suits in the hot weather, feeling so hot they can't breathe, while their companions are floating like immortals in a single silk summer dress. How different are their sufferings and pleasures? So I say: "Clothes make the man" is correct, but it should be added: "Domestic goods are glorious!"</p>

<p>Looking at the table, the differences in personnel and the complexity of the organizations naturally make it difficult to adapt government orders. Moreover, some organizations are supposed to be managed by a certain government office but are not, while others are not supposed to be managed but are, and others cannot be managed even if they want to. There are also organizations that were established earlier than the government office. (This is actually the easiest to solve, as long as the legal system is fixed, there will be a solution. For example, when Yan Xiaofang of Shanghai City planned to organize a Chamber of Commerce, the Qing government did not yet have a Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce. Later, the Chamber of Commerce had established rules, and everything ultimately became no problem.) There are also self-protective organizations that were created because of government office bans and regulations. Furthermore, the government offices themselves change frequently, and before they can exercise a certain power, they have already been reorganized or eliminated. This has created the current overlapping and fragmented agencies, and the bandit-occupied organizations, making it increasingly difficult to clean up. If the government can determine its authority as soon as possible, and decide which government office should be responsible for "Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Administration," and concentrate power and hand it over to that office, and at the same time rectify names and define responsibilities, and enact legal systems, how should those medical and pharmaceutical personnel be organized? How should they temporarily exercise their business? How should they be improved to the world's medical and pharmaceutical standards? Perhaps there is still a remedy. If we continue like this, treating the Department of Health as the former Qing Prime Minister's Office, and treating the Department's staff as "foreign devils" (a Boxer anti-foreign term), and calling some "National Medical Institute Elder Brothers" to draft new regulations, then Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals will simply never be able to get on track. Others say, "What is the chaos in the small medical and pharmaceutical world? It's just a microcosm of politics." I think that gentleman is exaggerating. Now, let me describe the government orders that the Department of Health has been trying in recent years, and see what the facts are.</p>
<h3>Common Sense for Choosing a Doctor</h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>The medical and pharmaceutical industry is an essential element for the health of the nation. Whether a nation is developed or not is closely related to medicine and pharmaceuticals. In various countries around the world, the nations with developed medical and pharmaceutical industries are also healthy, and their national strength is also increasing day by day. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has made improving medicine and pharmaceuticals one of its reform policies. The government advocated from above, and the people followed from below. Today, the development of medicine and pharmaceuticals is keeping pace with the prosperity of the country, which can be proven. Looking back at our country, internal affairs are not in order, and national disasters are imminent. Moreover, with natural and man-made disasters, the people are struggling to survive, and have no time to talk about medicine and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, in today's turbulent times, the Shen Bao is able to pay attention to the medical and pharmaceutical issues that are closely related to the health of the nation, and to explore and investigate them without sparing any effort, which is truly commendable and worthy of its duty as a newspaper.</p>
<p>Disease is a change in the state of life. If we want to bring this change back to normal, we cannot but rely on medicines and other therapies. In other words, the outcome of a disease depends on whether the therapy applied is appropriate or not. And the person in charge of this therapy is the doctor, who bears a heavy responsibility. The doctor is, in fact, in control of the life and death of human beings. When we are unfortunate enough to fall ill, can we not pay special attention to the choice of a doctor? Therefore, I will introduce a few rules of common sense for choosing a doctor to the readers, so that those who are worried about their health can know a little about how to find their way.</p>
<p>(1) The 20th century is a world of science. All undertakings are based on science. Those who conform to science will win, otherwise they will fail. This is generally recognized by the world. Medicine is a branch of science, and it is a discipline based on scientific research and treatment. Therefore, when we choose a doctor, we may not ask whether they are Chinese or Western, new or old, but welcome those who are based on science. If not, we should avoid them as if they were dirt, or attack them with drums. Modern new medicine, its methods of treatment, are the crystallization of scientific research and can meet the above-mentioned definition. Patients can clearly understand what to hold on to and what to let go of.</p>
<p>(2) Social customs are deteriorating, and people's hearts are no longer as they used to be. Medicine is originally a noble profession, but there are a few bad elements who disregard righteousness and use false and exaggerated advertisements in newspapers every day in the hope of attracting people into their clutches. With the development of medicine today, there are several diseases for which there is no definite cure, but they insist that they will be effective immediately and cured within a limited time, causing ignorant people to be deceived, which is a great harm to society. Therefore, we must not be fooled by them.</p>
<p>(3) Among the people who call themselves "national doctors," although there are no lack of excellent people, there are quite a few who use the name of their ancestors as a trick to attract patients. Ignorant people think that if they are not good doctors, how can they be passed down from generation to generation? But who knows that their so-called ancestral inheritance is not because the ancestors were born saints, how can they be able to control all kinds of diseases? Moreover, the progress of medicine and pharmaceuticals changes with the times. How can the wonderful skills and secret prescriptions of the past be adhered to forever and never changed? Are those sick families who are superstitious about ancestral inheritance also agree with my words?</p>
<p>(4) Although medicine and pharmacy have a mutual relationship, they are two different professions. In our country, medicine and pharmacy have always had no clear boundaries. Because doctors are not valued by the world, their backgrounds are mixed. No matter who they are, as long as they can read a few Tangtou songs, they are qualified to practice medicine. As a result, pharmacists, in order to attract business, even overstep their duties and diagnose diseases for people. People find it convenient, and they are very welcome. Fortunately, with the help of the power of nature, the disease is cured, and they greedily claim the credit as their own, and actually call themselves famous doctors. In fact, medicine and pharmacy each have their own specialties and cannot be confused. Moreover, it is very dangerous for pharmacists without medical knowledge to act as doctors. Those who do not want to gamble their lives should not employ these doctors with deformed mutations.</p>
<p>(5) Seeking medical treatment when sick has become a common sense of mankind. Unfortunately, our people's intelligence is too low, and they do not have a correct understanding of medicine and pharmaceuticals. Patients often do not seek treatment from doctors, but beg for help from ignorant wooden puppets, using talismans and fairy prescriptions to waste their precious lives. There are many such cases. It is unimaginable that the poison of the era of divine power is still prevalent in the country, which is truly regrettable. I hope that the intellectual class of society will quickly rise up and advocate its elimination.</p>
<p>(6) If a patient is fortunate enough to employ a doctor who is both knowledgeable and experienced, they must have absolute faith in them so that they can be treated in an orderly manner and recover quickly. Diseases have a certain course, and it is rare to be cured by one medicine. If they change doctors frequently and take all kinds of medicines, the human body is a limited organism, and not indestructible. How can it be used as a test field for medicines? Often they die not from the disease, but from the medicine. We must pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(7) Medicine is the crystallization of modern science, so those without scientific knowledge cannot be doctors. Moreover, the scope of medicine is very broad. We spend our whole lives and are fortunate enough to achieve something, but we cannot be proficient in all subjects. Therefore, those who are good at internal medicine may not be proficient in surgery, and those who are good at obstetrics may not be proficient in dentistry. The key is for patients to choose the doctor who is good at what they need, and they will be able to recover quickly.</p>
<p>(8) Foreigners come to China and use medicine and pharmaceuticals as a tool to promote religion. This has been going on for a long time and has gained the faith of the people. Those with superficial views often seek foreign doctors for treatment when they get sick, and they do not regret it until they die. This is because our country's science is backward, and the thought of worshiping foreigners is excessive. In fact, not all foreign doctors are knowledgeable and experienced. Moreover, there is a language barrier, and there are many obstacles to diagnosing diseases, which greatly affects the treatment. Recently, Chinese new medicine has made great progress and is sufficient to keep pace with foreign doctors. I hope that patients will quickly seek treatment from new doctors, and they will believe that my words are not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>In short, it is too late to seek medical treatment when you are sick. It is best to prevent it before you get sick. This is the way of hygiene. The Inner Canon says that eating and drinking should be regular, living should be moderate, and one should not work excessively, so that one can live with the gods and end one's natural life. This is the essence of hygiene. I hope we can reflect on these words repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Cun Kou Pulse Diagnosis (4)</h3>
<p>— She Yunxiu</p>
<p>(9) The Order of Heart, Liver, Kidney, Lung, Spleen, and Gate of Life</p>
<p>...arises from the profound theory of the five elements generating each other.</p>
<p>Your esteemed physicians recognize that the pulsation of the pulse indicates an imbalance in the zang-fu organs. Therefore, when they press their three fingers on the cun kou region of the patient, they are, of course, examining the qi of the zang-fu organs. On the left hand, the cun, guan, and chi positions naturally correspond to the qi of the heart, liver, and kidney.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>On the right hand, the cun, guan, and chi positions naturally correspond to the qi of the spleen, lung, and gate of life. The pulsation of the cun kou artery is naturally the manifestation of the waste qi of the heart, liver, and kidney, as well as the zang qi of the spleen, lung, and gate of life, traveling in separate directions, left and right, all arriving at the cun kou region. But how do these three zang qi travel sequentially to the cun kou region? Why is the right chi the zang qi of the gate of life, the right guan the zang qi of the spleen, the right cun the zang qi of the lung, and the left cun, left guan, and left chi the zang qi of the kidney, liver, and heart? No one in ancient times has ever explained this. Only Chu Yong, quoting from the Zun Sheng Jing, said, "The cun of the left hand is the uppermost, and the chi of the right hand is the lowermost. Men follow the yang, which ascends from below. Therefore, the lowermost position, the chi of the right hand, is the root of receiving life, like the undifferentiated Great Earth, primal chaos. Once life is received, all things emerge from the earth, with the spleen taking precedence. Therefore, the guan above the chi of the right hand is the spleen. The spleen earth generates metal, so the cun above the guan is the lung. The lung metal generates water, so the cun of the right hand crosses over the chi of the left hand to become the kidney. The kidney water generates wood, so the guan above the chi of the left hand is the liver. The liver wood generates fire, so the cun above the guan is the heart." From ancient times until now, this is the only explanation for the order of the heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and gate of life. Later generations have all followed his explanation, and there is no other theory to explain the relationship of the six pulse positions. Therefore, his explanation cannot but be regarded as the sole reason for the order of the six pulses. But please consider, gentlemen, can the words of the five elements generating and overcoming each other still exist in this era of science? Can it still be applied? Does it still have value? Can truth still be recognized in it? Moreover, the issue of left kidney and right gate of life is still a matter of endless debate throughout the ages. One side says this, the other says that, one theory refutes another, and there is still no definitive conclusion. How can it be used as a basis? Furthermore, the statement "the cun of the right hand crosses over the chi of the left hand" – how can the right hand reach over to the left hand? How can the right cun surpass the left chi? What reason can be given for this? Therefore, the words of the Zun Sheng Jing certainly have no solid basis, but merely play with the profound theories of yin-yang and the five elements.</p>
<p>(10) The length of the cun, chi, and the length of the zang qi's movement; the numbers cannot match.</p>
<p>Stepping back, let's not debate the truth or falsehood of their cun, guan, and chi theories, and the idea that the movement of the pulse is the movement of qi. Let's assume that they are based on fact. Then, how much space is there in the cun, guan, and chi positions? Dividing this one cun and nine fen of space among the three zang qi, it would be three sixes are eighteen, and three threes are nine, so each would get six fen, three li, and three hao. Therefore, each pulsation of the cun kou pulse would require these three zang qi, each with six fen, three li, and three hao, to connect to the cun kou region, one after the other, in order to perfectly match the one cun and nine fen of space. Moreover, when the cun kou pulse pulsates a second time, it would require another set of three zang qi, each with six fen, three li, and three hao, to arrive and take over this one cun and nine fen of space, in order to be completely accurate and never make a mistake. In other words, the distance that the cun kou pulse travels forward with each pulsation must be exactly one cun and nine fen, so that each of the six fen, three li, and three hao of each zang qi can connect to its own defense line. If it were off by even one fen or one hao, then their defense lines would undergo changes during the turnover between the old and the new. In another way of saying it: if the six fen, three li, and three hao of the left cun position is occupied by the zang qi of the heart pulse during the first pulsation of the cun kou pulse, and if the length of the zang qi of the heart pulse is not exactly six fen, three li, and three hao, then the left cun position will not be completely occupied by the zang qi of the heart pulse during the second pulsation. This is a very easy calculation to understand. There is no need to hire a highly skilled accountant to figure it out. What I want to know now is, what is the exact distance that the cun kou pulse travels with each pulsation, according to the ancients? Doesn't the Ling Shu clearly say, "With each pulse, the qi travels three cun"? According to this, it can be known that with each pulse, the qi only travels one cun and five fen. The difference between one cun and five fen and one cun and nine fen is four fen. If this difference rate is calculated, then it is incorrect. For example, during the first pulsation of the cun kou pulse, the three positions of the left hand are said to be occupied by the three zang qi of the lung, spleen, and gate of life. But by the second pulsation, the vanguard of the newly arrived heart qi can only travel one cun and five fen, and the distance between it and its own starting point in the cun position is still four fen. This four fen of space is still occupied by the rear guard of the old garrison, which is the kidney qi force. There are still four fen that have not yet left the territory and are still in the cun position. That is to say, during the second pulsation, of the six fen, three li, and three hao of the cun position, four fen is still occupied by the old kidney qi, and only two fen, three li, and three hao is heart qi. Of the six fen, three li, and three hao of the guan position, four fen is occupied by the newly arrived heart qi that has not yet fully taken over its own defense, and only two fen, three li, and three hao is liver qi. Of the six fen, three li, and three hao of the chi position, four fen is occupied by the newly arrived liver qi that has not yet fully taken over its own defense, and only two fen, three li is kidney qi. The remaining four fen of kidney qi is still outside the territory and has not yet entered its own defense line. According to this, the content of the cun, guan, and chi during the second pulsation becomes</p>
<p>complicated and is no longer purely heart, liver, and kidney. By the third pulsation of the cun kou artery, it becomes even more complicated. It simply gets to the point where the cun position is no longer entirely heart qi, the guan position is no longer entirely liver qi, and the chi position is no longer entirely kidney qi. They are all occupied by mixed troops. At this point, what possibility is there of the three positions examining the zang qi? This matter does not require the help of Chinese people who have received education beyond the secondary level to solve. Just ask a few of your esteemed physicians who have a little knowledge of classical Chinese and can read old Chinese medical books to thoroughly calculate</p>
<p>it. Please tell me if what I said is correct. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Common Sense Question and Answer on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(10) Intestinal Fever (Typhoid Fever) (Continued)</p>
<p>Question: Can the symptoms of intestinal fever patients in various parts of the body be described separately?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. In addition to the fever situation as described above, we can separately explain the symptoms of the digestive system, spleen, respiratory system, nervous system, circulatory system, skin, etc.</p>
<p>Question: What are the symptoms of the digestive system?</p>
<p>Answer: The symptoms of the digestive system are most obvious in the mouth, especially the tongue. At first, the tongue is dry and cracked, covered with a dirty coating. Later, it peels off from the tip of the tongue inward, so the tip of the tongue is clean, forming a triangle (triangular tongue).</p>
<p>Question: What other symptoms are there in the mouth?</p>
<p>Answer: There are also ulcerative stomatitis, thrush, parotitis, etc.</p>
<p>Question: Does the liver of intestinal fever patients undergo any changes?</p>
<p>Answer: The liver often becomes enlarged, which can cause jaundice.</p>
<p>Question: What changes occur in the intestines of intestinal fever patients?</p>
<p>Answer: Most often there is constipation, sometimes passing two or three times a day of pea-like diarrhea. Abdominal distention is more severe in the large intestine. The most important things are intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation.</p>
<p>Question: How does intestinal bleeding occur?</p>
<p>Answer: It is caused by the sloughing off of scabs on the ulcerated surface in the intestine. It usually occurs in the third week, and sometimes the amount of bleeding is very large, reaching more than one liter. At that time, the patient's body temperature drops sharply, and symptoms of anemia develop, leading to pale face, cold limbs, rapid and weak pulse, and then prostration.</p>
<p>Question: How does intestinal perforation occur?</p>
<p>Answer: Intestinal perforation is caused by the deep erosion of the ulcer in the diseased part of the intestine, leading to rupture of the intestinal tube. It mostly occurs in the third or fourth week, with sudden abdominal pain. Because gas enters the abdominal cavity, the abdomen is particularly distended, the dullness over the liver disappears, vomiting occurs repeatedly, hiccups, pulse becomes small and rapid, breathing is shallow, body temperature drops, and death occurs in a few hours to a few days.</p>
<p>Question: What changes occur in the abdominal glands and peritoneum?</p>
<p>Answer: The mesenteric glands and retroperitoneal glands become swollen and necrotic, and diffuse peritonitis may occur.</p>
<p>Question: What are the changes in the spleen?</p>
<p>Answer: The spleen enlarges, appearing from the end of the first week after the onset of the disease; by the second week, it reaches its maximum extent, and can be palpated under the left costal margin. This spleen enlargement is often consistent with the severity of the disease. If it swells to a high degree, it often causes severe pain. This is due to the tension of the splenic capsule. If intestinal bleeding occurs, it suddenly shrinks.</p>
<p>Question: Are there any changes in the respiratory system of intestinal fever patients?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. In the early stage, there may be severe epistaxis. The most characteristic thing is bronchitis that occurs after the first and second weeks, which often involves the deeper parts and becomes bronchopneumonia. In addition, there may be hypostatic pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, lung necrosis, pneumothorax, pulmonary infarction, etc. Sometimes, intestinal fever bacilli invade the larynx and lungs or pleura early, causing lesions in these many parts first.</p>
<h3>Scientific Principles of Preserving Life (24)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(19) Postpartum Care</p>
<p>(D) Six Weeks of Sexual Abstinence</p>
<p>During the postpartum period, couples should live together but not have sex, share a room but not a bed; only in this way can the drawbacks of intemperance be prevented. Because during this period, the postpartum woman's uterus has not yet fully recovered, if the couple does not abstain from sex, it is easy to cause local damage, or cause bleeding and puerperal fever. This six weeks of sexual abstinence is the minimum limit that couples should absolutely abide by.</p>
<p>(E) Breast Protection</p>
<p>During the postpartum period, unless there are special circumstances, it is relatively</p>
<p>more appropriate to breastfeed oneself. Because breast milk is the best for the infant's</p>
<p>nutrition, and breastfeeding oneself is beneficial to the postpartum recovery function.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours to thirty-six hours after delivery; the breasts are full, start breastfeeding. Before breastfeeding, the nipples must first be washed with 3% boric acid water, or rubbed with alcohol, and then wiped clean with water. If the nipples are inverted or flat, which may not be suitable for breastfeeding, a breast pump can be used to pump them out daily. The epidermis of the nipple is very weak, and often the epidermis peels off due to breastfeeding or irritation from milk secretion. If contaminated by unclean fingers, bacteria will enter and cause mastitis. This situation should be kept in mind. If it has already ruptured, boric acid water should be used to wash it quickly, and then boric acid ointment should be applied and bandaged to prevent corrosion. When breastfeeding, use a rubber or glass nipple shield to cover the breast, which can prevent the infant's lips from touching it. If one does not breastfeed, or if one breastfeeds and the mammary glands secrete vigorously, the breasts often become excessively tense and painful three to five days postpartum. At that time, using a breast pump to pump it out can only temporarily relieve the pain, and afterwards it will still accumulate repeatedly, and the swelling and pain will be even worse, so it is best not to use this method. To fundamentally solve the problem, bandages should be used to compress it on the second day postpartum, or warm compresses should be applied, and cotton gauze should be applied to the epidermis to promote absorption, and beverages should be restricted, and diuretic drugs should be administered. The common practice of decocting malt for consumption is for the purpose of diuresis. Or use Glauber's salt wrapped in old medicine, and the swelling can subside in about three or four days.</p>
<p>(20) Newborn Care</p>
<p>(A) Newborn State</p>
<p>The skin of a newborn's body has vernix caseosa. Three to four days after birth, the epidermis looks like bran, and after another day or two, it completely peels off. Newborns, regardless of gender, have breast swelling about three or four days after birth, and milk is secreted, similar to the mother's colostrum, called witch's milk, which gradually disappears after a week.</p>
<p>Newborns begin to urinate on the second day after birth, and gradually increase after the fourth day. Soon after birth, there is also the excretion of meconium, which is completely exhausted after four or five days. Meconium is green-black or yellowish-brown and contains viscosity. Although the average weight of a newborn can be calculated as 3 kilograms, there is room for increase or decrease depending on race, gender, and developmental status. Weight often decreases four days after birth, due to the excretion of urine and feces and the low intake of nutrients. Eight or nine out of ten newborns often develop a yellow color on the skin between the second and third day after birth without any kind of obstacle. It usually subsides naturally after a week. This is so-called physiological jaundice of the newborn, caused by physiological action, and is of no harm, so no special treatment is required, just pay attention to bowel movements.</p>
<p>(B) Functions of the Sensory Organs</p>
<p>A newborn's vision is only able to distinguish between light and dark during the first week after birth. After one month, they still do not have the ability to distinguish five colors. As for the steps of recognizing colors, they first recognize yellow and red, gradually understand white, and only know the difference between blue and green after one year. Newborns have no hearing until the end of the first week after birth, when they know sounds, so at this time, do not startle them with loud noises.</p>
<p>Among the newborn's sensory organs, touch, smell, and taste develop earliest. Fetal movement in pregnant women can prove that the newborn's sense of touch has already been completed in uterine life. After birth, the sensation of all parts such as the lips, eyelashes, and soles of the feet is particularly sensitive. As for the sense of smell, it has also been accomplished at the time of delivery, or so it is said, the identification of the mother's body depends entirely on the sense of smell, and the sense of taste for sweet, sour, bitter, and salty is also already prepared at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>(C) Skin Cleansing</p>
<p>Skin cleansing is very important for the health and development of the baby, so bathing is really essential. Also, if the buttocks and genitals are wet, they are easily chafed, and if the clothes and swaddling clothes are contaminated with urine or feces, they should be washed and changed quickly, and zinc oxide starch should be sprinkled on the wet local areas to keep them dry. If it has ulcerated, you can apply</p>
<p>Vaseline and other ointments.</p>
<p>(D) Umbilical Cord Stump</p>
<p>The umbilical cord stump falls off five or six days after delivery, and a scar forms after two weeks, becoming the navel. If the umbilical cord is not handled properly, there is a risk of suppuration and gangrene. The umbilical bandage must be changed at each bath. If there are signs of suppuration and</p>
<p>gangrene, gently wipe with 5% hydrogen peroxide and sprinkle with gallic acid lead oxide. After the umbilical cord falls off, pay attention to disinfecting the granulation surface, because the skin is not strong and is often easily infected with tetanus.</p>
<h3>New Interpretation of "Paralysis, Consumption, Bloating, and Diaphragmatic Disorder" (4)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(3) Diaphragmatic Disorder In general, diaphragmatic disorder refers to difficulty swallowing food. Patients often starve to death. This symptom is permanent. Stomach problems sometimes cause difficulty swallowing and vomiting, but recover after a few days (so-called temporary). Of course, this does not meet the criteria. The most consistent with this is esophageal cancer and stomach cancer. In addition, stomach ulcer can easily lead to stomach cancer complications over time, so the symptoms are sometimes similar. Esophageal dilation and stenosis, spasm and paralysis are also very similar. (The previously mentioned acute ascending paralysis sometimes also causes difficulty swallowing, which is very similar to this situation. However, this is only one of the entire symptoms of this disease. To save space in this article, this will not be described separately here.) Regarding the special circumstances of these diseases, I will now describe them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Esophageal Cancer This disease mostly occurs in the elderly over the age of forty. Its location is most often at the intersection of the esophagus and the left tracheal branch, followed by the lower end of the esophagus. Patients initially feel obstructed and have difficulty swallowing. The cancer also bleeds due to surface suppuration and ulceration. Suppurative inflammation occurs around it and breaks down into the lungs, pericardium, and pleura in all directions. The tracheal branch also narrows as a result. Most die of starvation. The course of the disease is less than one year. Treatment is generally ineffective. Esophageal stenosis is dilated with bougies, but it is not suitable if there is ulceration. If there is difficulty swallowing, fine bougies are used to instill glucose and other nutrients into the rectum to avoid excessive starvation. Injecting morphine and other anesthetics can suppress spasms, which can slightly reduce swallowing difficulties.</p>
<p>(2) Stomach Cancer This disease is mostly located at the pylorus, lesser curvature, and cardia. There are no special symptoms at the beginning. The stomach may feel heavy, and there may be a special aversion to certain foods (for example, meat and fish are possible). Nausea and vomiting, the vomitus sometimes contains blood, which is coffee-colored, containing food residue, mucus, and bile. Stomach acid is lacking, containing lactic acid, which is different from the hydrochloric acid contained in stomach ulcer. Later, anemia occurs, gradually becoming emaciated, and the result is cancerous cachexia and death. The prognosis of this disease is not good, and there is no good treatment. Conduraugo only has the effect of increasing appetite. Tinned ingots and fire-x treatment are also ineffective. Morphine and other anesthetics are used for severe pain. However, if the abdomen is opened for exploratory surgery when the symptoms are not yet obvious, and the cancerous part is removed, there is a better chance of recovery.</p>
<p>(3) Stomach Ulcer This disease affects women more often than men. The ulcer is mostly located on the posterior wall of the stomach, lesser curvature, and pylorus, and less often on the anterior wall of the stomach, greater curvature, and cardia. There are three main signs: severe stomach pain, vomiting, and stomach bleeding. The onset of pain is generally half an hour to one hour after eating. If too much solid food is ingested, the pain is more severe. The pain is burning or cutting, spreading to the sternum, shoulder blades, and abdomen. The vomitus is acidic. Bleeding often occurs suddenly, and each time it can reach up to one liter. The stool often appears black, which is a characteristic of this disease. Patients experience recurrent episodes that can last for decades. If complications such as perforated peritonitis and stomach cancer occur, most will succumb to the disease. Treatment focuses on avoiding indigestible and stimulating foods. Drugs can be taken internally, such as bismuth subnitrate. Cocaine is most effective for this pain, and antacids can also help.</p>
<p>(4) Esophageal Dilation This disease is either diffuse or its</p>
<p>localized bulging is a diverticulum, of which there are two types: one is an extrusion diverticulum, mostly caused by damage to the esophageal muscles. The food remaining in the esophagus pushes aside the muscle fibers, causing the mucosa to prolapse from the crevices. This diverticulum is mostly located at the junction of the pharynx and esophagus. The second is traction diverticulum, caused by inflammation of the lymph nodes at the tracheal bifurcation, which adhere to the outer wall of the esophagus and pull the esophageal wall from the outside, causing a part of it to turn out, or funnel-shaped. This treatment causes difficulty swallowing food, which stays in the esophagus. If a diverticulum occurs, the food stays in the sac and regurgitates due to belching. If this food rots, it causes bad breath. When food enters the diverticulum, a tumor can be seen in the neck, but when the diverticulum is empty, it disappears. Traction diverticulum has no special symptoms. Unless there is esophageal perforation, it is almost impossible to diagnose before death. The prognosis of this disease is generally poor, except for traction diverticulum. The worse the difficulty swallowing, the worse the prognosis. Treatment Use a bougie to send food to the stomach. Use nourishing products to irrigate the intestines, the so-called palliative treatment.</p>
<p>(5) Esophageal Stenosis This disease is mostly caused by the compression of nearby organs tumors, (such as aortic aneurysm) so it is secondary. In addition, esophageal cancer is most likely to cause this disease. Patients have difficulty swallowing, and food regurgitates immediately, gradually worsening. At first, it is solid food, and later even liquid food cannot pass. Patients therefore become increasingly emaciated, pale, and have a low temperature. In addition to treating the original disease for secondary disease, if there are only foreign objects, they can be removed with special bougies. In severe cases, surgery can be performed from the neck.</p>
<p>(6) Esophageal Spasm This disease is more common in hysterical patients. The spasm is mostly located in the uppermost or lowermost part of the esophagus. Patients experience spasmodic difficulty swallowing, sometimes accompanied by esophageal stenosis. pain; but sometimes it is easier to swallow solid food than liquid food, which is a characteristic of this disease. Treatment must focus on stopping the spasm. Opium preparations are often effective: patients who exercise more can strengthen the nervous system, which also helps.</p>
<p>(7) Esophageal Paralysis This disease is sometimes a local symptom of diphtheria, syphilis, or due to brain and spinal cord disease, or lead and alcohol poisoning. Patients experience paralytic difficulty swallowing. When food stays in the esophagus, the weight of the swallowed liquid is often used to lower it into the stomach; sometimes the esophagus dilates, and the heart and lungs are compressed, causing palpitations and difficulty breathing. Treatment with causal therapy is the most important. Among them, central intervention has a poor prognosis.</p>
<p>After looking at the conditions of the above diseases, we can understand that the term diaphragmatic disorder is a misnomer. The patient's pain has nothing to do with the diaphragm or any gas. Regarding the results of the diseases, except for cancer, which has not made significant progress in recent treatment studies, so there is little hope of recovery; the symptoms of diseases such as esophageal dilation, stenosis, spasm, and paralysis are almost the same as esophageal cancer on external observation. However, it is not that there is no hope of recovery. Especially for esophageal spasm and paralysis, the chance of life-threatening danger is very small. If stomach ulcer does not have complications, the danger is also relatively small, so it cannot be said that diaphragmatic disorder is incurable for the average person.</p>

<h3>An Explanation of "Wind and Moon"</h3>
<p>— Cang</p>
<p>Having been away from the North and Shanghai for three or four years to make a living, upon returning, Shanghai has indeed progressed significantly. Just considering the tabloids and small periodicals, they are now "too numerous to count"; moreover, the contributors to these publications have been replaced by a batch of entirely new figures.</p>
<p>I happened to flip through a few periodicals and found that there were quite a few "criticisms" of the "change of topic to wind and moon" in the free-talk section. Because they laughed too freely at wind and moon, it aroused some feelings in me, an outsider and idle person of wind and moon; but unfortunately, I am not a highly respected and substantial elder, unable to invite more noble writers to start more publications to defend wind and moon against slander.</p>
<p>Ancient people discussing methods of critiquing poetry emphasized "holding the emperor to command the feudal lords," but it was still a metaphor, an extremely abstract saying. However, people who write small articles now do it concretely as such. For example, if you betray the king, naturally the national law is in place, and "six armies can attack you"; but if you are "loyal to the king," that is also not obeying the king's transformation, and it is a "crime punishable by death." Therefore, the mystery of "holding the emperor" further puts you in a dilemma, just like the common saying, "A country bumpkin carrying a manure bucket, front and back is shit (a homophone for death)."</p>
<p>Not talking about wind and moon and talking about serious matters is certainly even more impossible. The bookworms of the Eastern Han Dynasty, angered by the decline of the Han Dynasty, discussed right and wrong, but in the end, they only suffered a ban on discourse and arrest, which serves as a lesson. As for "wind and moon is also not easy to talk about," wise gentlemen have already discussed it in detail. I am too talentless to elaborate. However, judging from the actual situation, like the pure conversations about wind and moon by Kong Rong and Ji Kang, you don't have to extinguish them; their results are still just inviting guests with peanuts and white wine, swallowing pills, and blacksmithing. They will absolutely not have any ambitions. Even if they harbor a greatest hope, at most, it is only to benefit A Dou. If you are Zhuge Liang, you should be open-minded and not be so "devoted to the utmost."</p>
<p>However, Kong Rong, Ji Kang, and others eventually ran into walls. Should this be blamed on wind and moon?</p>
<p>I feel that wind and moon is innocent. Cao Mengde's "singing when drinking wine" must eventually have "sparse stars"; who among the elegant officials in power during the Wei and Jin dynasties wasn't a skilled talker of wind and moon? From this, it can be seen that wind and moon is equal. What is strange is that those who lavishly talk about wind and moon do not allow others to talk much about wind and moon. This can only be said that wind and moon is fragile; it is very easy to be violated and monopolized.</p>
<p>However, there are not many people who can "hold the emperor." Wretched writers who cannot write good articles are at most acting as "nostrils"; if cunning rabbits disappear completely, the bad luck of "nostrils" will arrive. At the same time, "those who hold others are always held by others," and attention must also be paid to the other side. The "righteous dog" depicted in the articles of the Tongcheng School will not appear in this "degenerate" era.</p>
<p>Learning from Mr. He Jiaqian, I respectfully compose four quatrains of "Unliberated Poetry" as proof:</p>
<p>Looking at the rivers and mountains, it is easy to change, Talking about wind and moon is endless. What is the use of disguised elegance? First and foremost, one must love money.</p>
<p>The flourishing dynasties have always been said to be Zhou and Qin, Why should I rashly inquire about the crossing? Uncle Ye plays the zither, gazing at his reflection, He should be saddened that he is not allowed to be a golden man.</p>
<p>Waving the brush, all in vain, Heroic figures have always risen from the secretarial staff. Fame leads to profit, benefiting nine generations of officials, The borderlands naturally have Huo Piao Yao.</p>
<p>When Emperor Xian hurriedly bid farewell to the ancestral temple, Cao Fang awkwardly thanked the court, Switching allegiance to Qin or Chu is a common affair, Just like the charming national aunt, who is carved in tin.</p>
<h3>Photography Studio</h3>
<p>— Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Everything is piled up so messily: windows, doors, screens, tables, chairs, and everything else. I suspect I've run into the storage of an old furniture shop; no, this is the photography studio (Studio), the hall of twentieth-century art, the capital of the new era's culture.</p>
<p>America has Hollywood, which is the chapel of modern civilization. It is said that even savage women in Africa have learned the eyebrow-drawing and kissing techniques of American stars. Who says movies aren't the most powerful religion today? Shanghai also has Shanghai's Hollywood. Let's go on a pilgrimage to this Hollywood.</p>
<p>A director led us into the "shed." Outside a building like the cargo depot of the pre-burned North Railway Station, there were many scenes laid out with earth, wood, iron sheeting, paper, and paint: a small street here, the white wall of a shikumen; a small mountain there, a red ancient temple. Two large cylinders were made of iron sheeting and coated with mud. I looked for a long time before realizing that these were two trees in front of the ancient temple gate. Why do even these ordinary exterior scenes have to be fabricated behind closed doors? The director explained the trouble of filming exterior scenes to me: idlers want to see the female stars and can't be dispersed; the ground is uneven, making it inconvenient to move the camera; and one thing I think he didn't say is that it costs more money. For the sake of the truth of art, it takes more trouble and more money, which is a bit against the spirit of capitalist artists!</p>
<p>Walking into the "shed," there was a strong smell of kerosene, a stuffy airflow, and dim light. A magnificent palace, a room in a country person's house, everything was quiet. Only a few workers not in the shot were working hard, sweating profusely. The director slumped down in a short chair, and the lighting manager began to direct the lights to be turned on. The workers climbed onto the roof like dogs. The cameraman moved back and forth, focusing on the camera. Everything was ready, except for the star.</p>
<p>Where's the star? The star went to see a movie at the Grand Theatre. The director sighed:</p>
<p>"For those who come to watch filming for the first time, no one can wait!"</p>
<p>We finally made an exception, flipping through the script and talking nonsense. In the end, we waited. A minor star came in, dressed as a country girl, conspicuously wearing a pair of yellow leather shoes.</p>
<p>"Wrong, wrong, go and change them!"</p>
<p>"I don't have any other shoes."</p>
<p>Then the male star came, smiling, and sat aside. The female star naturally came last, huffing and puffing, talking about makeup:</p>
<p>"It's unlucky, this blue cloth shirt has stained my body blue." As she spoke, she held up a cigarette with fingers painted bright red, and her narrow, long-drawn eyebrows arched upwards. Would you believe that this is the daughter-in-law of a poor peasant family? But:</p>
<p>"Cameraman!"</p>
<p>Under the white-hot mercury lamp, the film rustled. "There's no way, it's easy to talk about, but there are many difficulties when it comes to doing it."</p>
<p>So, the daughter of a Jiangbei dockworker has her hair permed, and a female clerk from a real estate company is treated like a compradore's daughter. You must know, if the hair isn't permed and the eyebrows aren't long, would she still be considered a female star? Female stars are a new species of the twentieth century. They want to be specimens at the national fashion conference and queens at the charity tea dance:</p>
<p>Okay, goodbye, photography studio! After breathing a sigh of relief, someone said:</p>
<p>"Since transformation is difficult, it might as well just play the part of a modern young lady forever!"</p>
<p>"But no one watches modern young ladies anymore."</p>
<p>Spending two dimes to find art on the screen is completely different from the actual creation of art. There is an irreconcilable contradiction between these two, which I deeply experienced in the photography studio.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Butt</h3>
<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>I seemed to have heard a friend tell me that Christians say:</p>
<p>"A cigarette is a coffin nail."</p>
<p>This saying lingered in my mind; how many nails have probably been nailed into my body and pierced through my heart. But I don't care, I am the kind of person who needs nails to nail me often, that is, I often need some stimulation - if stimulation is a more pleasing word.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my body is too bad. This almost completely disabled shell is indeed not far from the coffin; but I have never absolutely and ruthlessly quit smoking.</p>
<p>If cigarettes truly symbolize coffin nails and their harm, then perhaps many nails are what I should prepare.</p>
<p>Loneliness often becomes my companion. With it, I feel fulfilled; continuing and prolonged fulfillment, and then cigarettes become loneliness's only companion. I am close to my companion, and at the same time, I have discovered that we have the same fate. I am a person without any reason. I think that the things my eyes can see have the same existence as them. One by one, short cigarettes, I see that they all have their own fate.</p>
<p>Most of them are extinguished in the past burnings, and the remaining fate process reflected in my mind is probably a microcosm of my own remaining fate. If it had knowledge, it would definitely have confidence in its companion.</p>
<p>Throw it where the wind blows, and it will continue to burn in the wind, burning until death. Throw it where it rains, and it can live in hope, waiting for a raindrop that doesn't know when it will come to hit it squarely, and then it will burn longer and come to an end. Or, if there is no wind and no rain, just hide in a corner, able to burn yourself leisurely, its breath may make people cover their noses even more.</p>
<p>Shameful! Only a broken tail that is neither dead nor alive but remains on the ground is shameful!</p>
<p>Burn, burn completely; if it is a nail, it must be nailed to the end severely, so that no one can see it.</p>
<h3>New Talk on Old Books</h3>
<p>— Feng Wu</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Song Dynasty Yuan Jiong's "Maple Window Small Notes" records:</p>
<p>Emperor Huizong once rode a Siji horse to Taihe Palace, suddenly summoning the small crow he usually loved. When the horse arrived in front of the emperor, its hooves refused to move forward. The attendants whipped it, but it neighed and jumped even more, and would not be tamed. At that time, a person in the crowd said, "It wishes to be granted an official title." The emperor smiled and said, "Monkeys are already given official positions as offerings, let alone this small crow?" He bestowed the title of General Longxiang upon the horse, and then it became submissive and docile.</p>
<p>This story can very well be included in the "Humorous Anthology" of the "Analects." Since monkeys have become officials, horses naturally refuse to submit, neighing and jumping unruly, putting on airs, this is the inevitable result. However, in the end, it is only "putting on airs," so after being granted an official title, the horse immediately became "submissive and docile," no longer "neighing and jumping." The word "submissive" can be called a stroke of genius.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Ming Dynasty Li Rihua's "Purple Peach Pavilion Miscellany" records:</p>
<p>The Taoist Wu Hanxu liked to sleep all day long, and people called him Wu the Sloth. He said, "If people want to be leisurely, they must first learn to be lazy. If they are not lazy, they will definitely not be leisurely."</p>
<p>This Taoist truly understands the samadhi of laziness. He can write a philosophy of laziness. In reality, this kind of theory can only be experienced by people like Taoists. Those who rush around for food and clothing every day can be said to have no chance. A certain gentleman heard this and said, "In times of national crisis, how can the whole country be lazy? The advocate of this philosophy of laziness should be specially commended."</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The master of humor, Mr. Lin Yutang, has recently praised Zheng Banqiao greatly and feels very happy about Banqiao's scolding of intellectuals. Yesterday, I read a letter from Zhou Yunshu, which has a passage that can be said to complement Banqiao's words. The letter says:</p>
<p>I often laugh at poor scholars who have been running around the famous scene for decades and are still hungry and cold. They sit and watch the kitchen desolate, their wives and children weeping, looking up at the roof and sighing, at a loss. When they go out and see the merchants and monks in the market, dressed in fine clothes and eating delicious food, they are surprised as if they were heavenly beings. And then they sit upright and speak loudly, saying that if they were useful, they would definitely be able to manage the world and clothe and feed the people, who would believe them? My friends often have this habit, which is most laughable.</p>
<p>I say, if these people really become officials, we will not only "laugh," but we will "suffer." If we talk about examples, in today's world, where are they not?</p>

<h3>Ordinary Affairs (7)</h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"You really know how to calculate," Pei Yu said as if angry, "Go and pack the car."</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, she walked towards her bedroom. At this time, Bo Tang, wearing a bathrobe, was preparing to go downstairs to ask Ah Ming. Pei Yu stood by the bed and said loudly to him:</p>
<p>"You didn't listen to me last night. Now, the person can't be found!"</p>
<p>"Can't be found? What's wrong?" Bo Tang asked calmly.</p>
<p>She reported and complained about Ah Ming's words to him; then she said:</p>
<p>"This is the result of your leisurely handling of things!"</p>
<p>"Ah Ming's guess is somewhat correct," Bo Tang said, "Zhi Guang certainly won't run around, and the people in the factory won't make things difficult for him."</p>
<p>"Then, even if they walk slowly, they should have arrived by now! Since you said Ah Ming guessed it, why haven't they come yet?" "I can't answer you immediately on this point..."</p>
<p>"Then," Pei Yu interrupted, "it shows that Ah Ming guessed wrong!"</p>
<p>"You're being arbitrary again!"</p>
<p>"Since you can't answer me immediately, don't say I'm being arbitrary!"</p>
<p>"Although I can't guess the result, judging from the motive, you don't have to worry..."</p>
<p>"What motive?... What is the motive?"</p>
<p>"The motive is to provide relief! Since the topic is so beautiful, the article they are preparing to write must also be splendid, so you don't have to worry about the 'person.'"</p>
<p>"You say I don't have to worry about the person, then what are you worried about?"</p>
<p>"What I'm worried about is that they have too much hope for the material aspects of the relief supplies."</p>
<p>"They're probably afraid you won't satisfy their hopes, so they involve the 'person.'"</p>
<p>"But then it won't be a splendid article with a beautiful topic."</p>
<p>She seemed to believe it a little and sat down on the bed casually:</p>
<p>"Then, you have to find a way to tell them to do it steadily and splendidly."</p>
<p>"That's right, I'm preparing to eat something now and then go to the Da Nanmen factory..."</p>

<h3>Methods for Cotton Farmers to Improve Cotton – Feng Zhaochuan</h3>
<p>In recent years, cotton imports have jumped to the top of all goods, and when its value is highest, it even reaches 180 million Customs Taels, the enormity of the leakage is truly alarming. Examining the reason why cotton imports have increased sharply, there are two important reasons: (1) Demand for raw cotton exceeds supply. Looking at the three most recent years, from the 19th to the 21st year, the national raw cotton sales volume has averaged 8,921,727 dan per year for factories, and about 2 million dan for clothing and hand spinning, totaling 10,921,727 dan. The average annual domestic cotton production is 7,771,661 dan. After exporting 759,557 dan, only 7,012,104 dan remain. If we compare production with consumption, the annual domestic shortage of cotton averages 3,909,623 dan. Therefore, foreign cotton imports have averaged as high as 3,940,690 dan annually over these three years, which is caused by the lack of domestic cotton production. (2) The quality of raw cotton is not suitable. Domestic textile production has shifted from coarse to fine, and the focus of yarn production has shifted from 16 counts to 20 counts. Therefore, in the cotton composition used by yarn factories in the most recent three years, country cotton has decreased from 63.11% to 52.13%, Indian cotton has decreased from 22.76% to 8.81%, other cottons have decreased from 0.32% to 0.03%, while American cotton has increased sharply from 13.60% to 38.58%, and Egyptian cotton has increased sharply from 0.21% to 0.45%. The use of coarse and short cotton is decreasing daily, while the demand for fine and long cotton is increasing daily. The quality of cotton produced in our country is inherently poor, and it is further unsuitable for factory use due to the addition of water and impurities, while foreign cotton takes the opportunity to dump its products in our country. Having learned that cotton imports have reached an alarming record recently, and that the crux of the matter lies in the quantity and quality of cotton, then if we want to solve this serious problem, we must also make efforts to improve both the quantity and quality of cotton. However, in our country, the cause of improving cotton planting, from the early years of the Republic to the present, has not been successful in the end, because unless all cotton farmers join the cotton planting movement, work hard to produce, and strive for improvement, relying solely on the cotton planting promotion of a few experimental farms or agricultural schools will be of no avail. Therefore, based on personal insights, I will describe the methods for cotton farmers to improve cotton, for the adoption of</p>
<p>domestic cotton farmers.</p>
<h3>(A. Temporary Solutions)</h3>
<p>The inadequacy of our country's cotton production and the degradation of quality are due to many innate shortcomings, but there are also many due to human factors. If farmers can pay a little attention and seek to improve cotton, it will be as easy as turning one's hand. Here, the main ones are selected and briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1. Improved Harvesting)</p>
<p>Ordinary cotton harvesting always mixes together cotton harvested in the early, middle, and late seasons, regardless of quality. It is not known that the cotton harvested in each season varies in length and quality. Once mixed, the good and bad cotton fibers are mixed together, which is most忌讳 by yarn factories. Among the cotton products in our country, there is no lack of a small number of excellent cotton fibers, but due to harvesting reasons, they are almost completely destroyed. The manager of a yarn factory once told the author that "the current domestic cotton fibers are of uneven quality, mixed and unbearable, with long mixed with short, and short fibers becoming waste cotton. Even if short is mixed with long, it is still a waste of effort. When used to make yarn, the thickness is uneven, which is labor-intensive and costly. It is far不如 foreign cotton, where long fibers are long fibers and short fibers are short fibers, which is very convenient and economical to purchase according to needs. Therefore, general yarn factory owners often have the painful experience of having to use foreign cotton." It can be seen that improving harvesting methods is the most urgent task for farmers to improve cotton. Assuming that farmers can harvest in stages during the cotton harvest, and collect yellow and inferior cotton separately, then the cotton fibers that used to be of unequal length, mixed with good and bad, and unsuitable for the needs of yarn factories, can all be transformed into distinct grades, neat and uniform, so why would factories have to use foreign cotton? Recently, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has proposed the idea of on-site cotton inspection, intending for cotton farmers to prepare a "faithful" small sample on the outside of the package when ginning and packing, so that the government can inspect the moisture content, assess the grade, etc., without having to open the large package and select samples. This method is well-intentioned, and it is hoped that the government can implement it as soon as possible, and that cotton farmers can follow the procedures,</p>
<p>and that factories can purchase this kind of "genuine" cotton at a premium price, then farmers will definitely be happy to do so.</p>
<p>(2. Eliminating Bad Habits)</p>
<p>After the harvest, some farmers in our country often add water and impurities, and even add inferior and fake materials, in order to increase the weight and seek unexpected profits. This is indeed a bad habit of farmers, but it is also promoted unintentionally by flower shops and yarn factories. Because cheaters are not subject to any restraint, they are happy to get small profits, and those who do not cheat do not have any preferential conditions, and instead suffer losses, so no one does not cheat, no flowers are without cheating, and the cotton becomes moldy and mixed, the good becomes inferior, and the inferior even ceases to be a cotton fiber. I don't know how many of our country's cotton is so damaged and cannot be used for textile production every year, which is very regrettable. Although the government has now established a special bureau to carry out inspections, the stricter the regulations, the more skillful the cheating. To eliminate this long-standing habit of farmers, the end lies in yarn factories and flower shops being able to be consistent and reward flower fibers that are not cheating with a premium price, in order to assist the government in its inspection work. If this is the case, farmers will have something to gain, so why would they want to cheat and break the law! Once the bad habits of farmers are eliminated, the proportion of our country's self-produced cotton that is suitable for application will naturally increase a lot.</p>
<p>(3. Eliminating Pests and Diseases)</p>
<p>Everyone knows that pests and diseases are enough to reduce cotton production, but fewer people know that pests and diseases are enough to damage the quality of cotton. According to the tests of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, the infestation of red bollworms is obviously enough to reduce the natural twist and strength of the cotton绒. This is evidence that insect pests are enough to damage cotton quality. Also, cotton blight and other diseases can damage the affected cotton and make it unsuitable for spinning. This is further evidence that diseases are enough to damage cotton quality. The cotton fields in our country have always been neglected in terms of cleanliness, and pests and diseases are particularly rampant. Production is reduced, quality is deteriorated, and the loss of cotton production is very large. If cotton farmers can follow the guidance of agricultural agencies and implement prevention to the extent possible before pests and diseases occur, and work hard to eliminate them after they occur, so as to avoid future troubles, and can collect the affected cotton separately and not mix it into the good cotton, then our country's cotton production can not only be increased, but the quality can also be prevented from being damaged by various acquired factors. The improvement of raw cotton can be</p>
<p>confidently expected.</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Method of Governance</h3>
<p>The low yield and declining quality of domestic cotton are primarily due to three fundamental shortcomings: (1) unimproved cotton seeds, (2) neglectful cultivation practices, and (3) a lack of organization among cotton farmers. To address these issues effectively, farmers should focus all their efforts on these three areas and seek rapid improvements. The methods for improvement are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Improving Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>Currently, the latest methods for improving seeds of crops generally involve: (1) Introducing superior varieties: This means importing proven superior varieties from other countries or regions, acclimating them, and adapting them for local planting. This is the main method for utilizing existing superior varieties. (2) Pure-line selection: This involves collecting a large number of varieties, lines, or individual plants, conducting precise comparative experiments, and then selecting the desired ones, maintaining their propagation for planting. This is a method of artificially selecting superior varieties from those that naturally exist or newly emerge in nature for application. (3) Hybrid breeding: This involves selecting several lines with particularly excellent traits, conducting artificial crosses to combine all the superior traits into one, gathering them into one individual plant, and creating an ideal variety that is as perfect as possible. This is a method of artificially manipulating existing superior varieties in nature to breed new varieties. (4) Artificial mutation induction: Using methods such as X-rays or lightning to induce mutations in organisms has been successful in barley. With the rapid advancements in science, this method can be applied to crop breeding to induce various mutations, increase the materials available for selection, and breed new varieties that are difficult to produce in nature. This is a method of applying science to overcome nature and seek improvement. Improving cotton seeds also involves using these various methods. However, it may be unrealistic to expect European and American farmers to apply all four methods, let alone Chinese cotton farmers. To ensure practical implementation, I propose the following cotton seed improvement methods that Chinese cotton farmers can implement:</p>
<p>(1) Accepting Superior Varieties: Some Chinese cotton farmers do not retain seeds themselves and purchase cotton seeds of unknown origin and mixed quality from flower merchants, yarn factories, or cotton seed vendors annually for planting. Although some farmers retain seeds, either the seed quality is inherently poor, or the method of seed selection is flawed, leading to seed degeneration. If the seeds used have already degenerated, how can one expect good cotton in the future? Yet farmers do not understand and either doubt and reject improved cotton seeds or even become hostile and oppose them collectively. This self-destructive and suicidal inferiority complex must be completely eradicated. The key to eradication lies in guiding farmers to recognize the importance of improved seeds through various methods and to be willing to accept the mission of using improved cotton seeds, which is currently the most important task.</p>
<p>(2) Paying Attention to Replanting: Weather conditions are constantly changing. Regardless of location or year, cotton seedlings are always prone to dying. When seedlings die, replanting is necessary. The key to replanting is to use the reserved improved variety seeds and never arbitrarily replant other local varieties to avoid mixing the cotton crop and confusing the cotton seeds.</p>
<p>(3) Eliminating Inferior and False Plants: Cotton seeds in the fields have natural opportunities for cross-pollination and various variations, and there are also risks of mechanical mixing during harvesting, ginning, and transportation. Therefore, eliminating inferior and false plants is crucial for maintaining the purity of the cotton crop and the purity of the cotton seeds. If this can be done during the seedling stage, the losses will be minimized. Even during the growth stage, any false or inferior plants should be removed without hesitation. However, because ordinary farmers only care about the present and are unwilling to comply, extension agency personnel may be able to use incentive policies to promote implementation and cultivate the habit of eliminating inferior and false plants.</p>
<p>(4) Retaining Seeds: Farmers should retain their own seeds, drying and ginning the seeds from the plants that grow most vigorously in mid-season and storing them properly for use the following spring.</p>
<p>(5) Changing Seeds Regularly: After three to five years, the cotton seeds obtained by farmers will inevitably change. Farmers lack the ability and time to conduct breeding work. Therefore, they can exchange for new seeds from experimental fields every three or five years to avoid the problem of degeneration.</p>
<p>(6) Cooperative Seed Propagation: Some of the more enlightened farmers (A) can jointly organize cooperative cotton fields with cotton farms, using simple mixed-selection methods to propagate superior seeds for their own use and for the use of other cotton farmers. (B) Or, following the example of cotton seed cooperatives in India, several households can cooperate to jointly operate seed fields, seek guidance from cotton farms, and jointly propagate superior seeds for the use of members and other cotton farmers.</p>
<p>If the majority of cotton farmers can retain improved seeds themselves, and a few excellent farmers can cooperate to propagate superior seeds for the use of other farmers, and if the government's cotton improvement farms provide support and guidance, then there is hope that cotton farmers across the country will be willing to use improved seeds.</p>
<p>(2) Improving Cultivation Practices</p>
<p>Even if improved cotton seeds have excellent genetic traits, they must also have a good environment to fully develop their good traits and achieve a satisfactory harvest. The cotton environment, like that of other plants, includes the soil environment, the biological environment, and the climate environment. All or part of these three can be controlled by cultivation methods. Therefore, the methods for improvement are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Improving the Soil Environment: When planting cotton, the first environment that cotton seeds come into contact with is the soil. Whether the moisture, temperature, nutrients, etc., in the soil are suitable depends on the diligence and effectiveness of plowing, fertilization, and other techniques. If the soil environment is suitable, the cotton yield can certainly be increased, and the quality will also generally be improved. For example, if cotton plants receive adequate moisture when the young bolls are first forming and the cotton fibers are growing, the fibers will develop fully, becoming long and fine. American cotton graders can judge the origin of cotton based on the length and quality of the fibers because they deeply understand the relationship between soil moisture and fiber length. Furthermore, if there is a lack of potassium fertilizer, there will be more dead bolls, and the cotton fibers in these dead bolls will lose strength and curl, reducing the quality. Chinese cotton farmers, either due to limited capital or habit, pay the least attention to fertilization and plowing, which needs immediate attention to improve the quality of cotton.</p>
<p>(2) Improving the Climate Environment: The climate, including sunlight, humidity, air humidity, and rainfall, is as important to the success or failure of cotton production as the soil. For example, the longest-fiber sea island cotton can only thrive in humid regions, such as the sea islands off the coast of America and the West Indies. Similarly, Egyptian cotton is only suitable for areas with strong sunlight and high temperatures, such as the southwestern United States and Egypt in Africa. It cannot be grown in rainy and low-temperature areas. Climate restricts the potential of superior cotton varieties more than soil. Although ordinary farmers believe that climate is determined by weather and cannot be controlled by humans, they are unaware that cultivation methods can also affect the climate environment. For example, Chinese cotton farmers practice broadcasting and prefer dense planting, which obstructs branches and leaves, restricts sunlight, impedes air circulation, and causes excessive evaporation from the ground, creating a poor environment even during seasons of clear weather and favorable winds. If cultivated in this way for a long time, how can cotton grow well? Therefore, cotton farmers should accept new cotton planting methods, pay attention to thinning seedlings to a certain distance, and retain a fixed number of cotton plants, ensuring that the density of the cotton is appropriate and that the existing good environment does not become poor. This is essential.</p>
<p>(3) Improving the Biological Environment: The biological environment of cotton, such as root nodule bacteria in the soil, various bacteria in the air, and various cotton insects, can be either beneficial or harmful, and its effect is greatly influenced by cultivation. For example, cotton farmers in Zhejiang and Nantong often plant alfalfa in wheat rows in winter to utilize the nitrogen produced by root nodule bacteria in the soil as a base fertilizer. This good habit should be followed by cotton farmers in other regions. However, bad habits, such as leaving cotton stalks in the cotton fields over the winter without pulling them out, allowing spores of bacteria and eggs and pupae of pests to hide and thrive, and then causing harm again in the spring, should be thoroughly corrected. Anything that can improve the biological environment of cotton is also a method of improving cotton. Pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(4) Improving Organization: It can be said that Chinese cotton farmers have no organization. As a result, cotton seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, transportation, sales, etc., are all manipulated, restricted, and exploited by unscrupulous merchants and capitalists. Those responsible for revitalizing rural areas, desiring the improvement of cotton farmers and cotton, see the organization of cotton farmers as a prerequisite. No matter how much cotton is improved, if cotton farmers are not organized, the benefits of cotton planting will still be seized by unscrupulous merchants and capitalists, and it will be difficult for cotton farmers to receive any benefit. The most needed organization in cotton-growing areas is cooperation. The most urgent needs in cooperative enterprises are: (1) Credit cooperatives: Chinese farmers are known for their poverty, and those who reclaim land and plant cotton in coastal and mountainous areas are among the poorest of the poor. Therefore, their economic difficulties are even greater than those of ordinary farmers. At a time when there is a lack of funds for production and no access to loans, it is urgent that authorities guide cotton farmers to organize credit cooperatives. This can eliminate usurious exploitation and help them operate in a timely manner. (2) Production cooperatives: Recently, there have been proposals to organize production cooperatives to procure and supply production necessities such as seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and livestock to members. In this way, farmers can have access to production materials without wasting or diverting funds for other purposes. If this principle is followed, the funds of the production cooperatives can be used entirely for production, and bank loans will have greater security. This is an excellent method. (3) Marketing cooperatives: Cotton farmers work hard all year round. Their only hope and consolation lie in good prices and final profits. However, the price of cotton in various places, especially in the interior, is determined by the unilateral will of cotton merchants. Forced by economic circumstances, farmers are eager to sell their cotton as soon as it is available and can only listen to their control, unable to do anything about it. This is the most unfair fact in the world. Farmers should be guided to organize marketing cooperatives to ensure that they receive fair prices. Furthermore, due to economic pressure, farmers often borrow money, fertilizers, and seeds from stores or capitalists for production. In order to maintain their private interests, these stores also coerce farmers, preventing them from switching to improved cotton seeds and accepting new methods of improved cotton planting. This has already been proven in Zhejiang. Therefore, if we want to improve cotton farmers and cotton, but fail to first guide cotton farmers to organize and completely break away from the old evil environment of rural areas, then all propaganda, promotion, and the power and influence of all rural revitalization movements will be unable to compete with the entrenched evil forces in rural areas, and the cause will have no hope of success. Those responsible for revitalizing rural areas should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Cotton Cultivation Methods by Sun Enjun</h3>
<p>There are two approaches to developing cotton production: (1) increasing the cotton field area and (2) increasing the yield per acre of existing cotton fields. The former is promotion, and the latter is improvement. Here, we focus on improvement.</p>
<p>Improvement of cotton cultivation can be divided into three aspects: (1) improving cotton varieties, (2) improving cotton cultivation methods, and (3) preventing and controlling cotton pests and diseases. Among the three, the second is the most important because improving cotton varieties requires proper cultivation to achieve significant results. Preventing and controlling pests and diseases also relies on proper cultivation to prevent problems before they occur. Therefore, improving cultivation is a central issue for breeding and pest/disease control, and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>However, cotton cultivation is not easy to discuss. Soil and climate vary from place to place, and the natural environment cannot be arbitrarily changed by human power. A good cotton cultivation method in area A may not be applicable in area B. What is suitable for this year may not be suitable for next year. Experts in this field are valued for their ability to adapt to circumstances and make changes according to the location, rather than adhering to fixed methods and being inflexible. Therefore, improving cotton cultivation should recognize the natural background and handle it well, which is the first point. Furthermore, factors such as the amount of agricultural labor, the affluence of the rural economy, the size of land holdings, and the price of goods also vary from place to place. Certain agricultural tools may be necessary in area A, but not applicable in area B. Certain practices may be common in area C, but not cost-effective in area D. What is beneficial to us? What is harmful? What is appropriate? What is not? We must also recognize the background of rural society and make good adjustments, which is the second point. For these reasons, the author cannot write a cotton cultivation method that is universally applicable, nor can he specify how any particular task should be improved. He can only discuss a few less important points in cotton cultivation and briefly indicate the path to improvement.</p>
<p>(1) The Problem of Double Cropping in Cotton Fields</p>
<p>In several northern provinces (such as Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi), the growing season is short, and cotton fields only need one crop, with complete fallow in winter. This was the case when planting native cotton, and it is still the case with American cotton. In several southern provinces (such as Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi), the growing season is long, and winter crops can still be planted in cotton fields in addition to growing cotton in the summer. This was the case when planting native cotton, and it is still the case with American cotton. Only in the central provinces (such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei) is the growing season of moderate length. If native cotton is planted, winter cropping is not hindered. However, if American cotton is planted, winter cropping is no longer possible. In other words, if there is a winter crop in the field, it does not interfere with the planting of native cotton. However, if American cotton is planted, the cotton harvest will be greatly affected. According to the author's many years of experimental results, planting American cotton in wheat fields usually results in a very poor harvest in normal years. Only in years when the autumn weather is particularly favorable and the spring and summer weather is unfavorable can the harvest of American cotton in wheat fields be equal to that of American cotton in winter-fallowed land. This is a rare opportunity that occurs only once in ten years. It can be seen that it is not suitable to plant wheat in American cotton fields, and it is impossible to plant American cotton in wheat fields, which is beyond doubt. Therefore, in the central provinces, if American cotton is to be promoted, it is best to sacrifice winter crops and specialize in planting one crop of American cotton, because its good quality and abundant yield make it economically worthwhile. This change can be easily implemented in countries with larger agricultural systems and better rural economies. However, the situation in our country is different. Farmers are poor, and spring food relies entirely on the wheat harvest for relief. Therefore, they would rather sacrifice the planting of high-quality and urgently needed American cotton than give up the low-profit, labor-intensive wheat crop for financial turnover. This is an example of how our country's social background affects the improvement of cotton cultivation, and it is also a special difficulty in our country's research on cotton cultivation. The author has studied this issue for nearly ten years, hoping to find appropriate methods in cultivation so that American cotton and winter crops can coexist in the central provinces without conflict. The following is a summary of the research findings:</p>
<p>(1) Rye is a better winter crop for American cotton fields than wheat, broad beans, peas, or rapeseed. (2) American cotton should be row-sown between rye rows, and the row and plant spacing should not be too wide. Row spacing should be 1.2 to 1.5 feet, and plant spacing should be 5 to 6 inches. (3) American cotton should be planted earlier in winter-fallowed land (around Grain Rain), but it should not be planted too early between rye rows (from Start of Summer to a few days after Start of Summer), because the cotton seedlings may be trapped under the rye shade for too long, and will not thrive in the future. It is better to sow later and cut the rye after germination, which is a good strategy. (4) If the field is too dry after cutting the rye, it is best to irrigate once and apply quick-acting fertilizer to promote cotton seedling growth and prevent them from wasting time. Although the cost is high, the benefits can compensate for more than enough. (5) Since the seasons for American cotton and rye are short, early-maturing varieties of American cotton and rye should be selected to compensate. (6) When sowing wheat in late autumn, there will still be many American cotton bolls that have not opened. It is okay to pull up the cotton plants and handle them properly, as they can still gradually open without affecting the color. Losses cannot be avoided, but fortunately they are not large.</p>
<p>(2) Fertilization Issues</p>
<p>Whether it is native cotton or American cotton planted in wheat fields, there is a need to study fertilization. Cotton sowing occurs when wheat is about to mature, so fertilizer should not be applied to avoid delaying wheat maturity. After the wheat is removed from the field, the cotton seedlings need fertilizer. However, it is a dry season, and fertilizer application is not effective. Soon after, the rainy season arrives, and there is a risk that the applied fertilizer will be washed away by rain. Therefore, it is customary to apply fertilizer after the rainy season, but the season is late, so quick-acting fertilizer must be used. Human manure is used by some, but its application is inconvenient and requires a lot of labor, which is not favored by most. Bean cake is quick-acting and rich in nutrients, making it the most important fertilizer for cotton fields in our country. Cotton cake comes from cottonseed and, in terms of source and nutrient content, should be the best and most economical fertilizer for cotton. However, it is abandoned because it takes longer to see results and is instead bought by the Japanese. As a result, farmers in our country's cotton-growing areas sell their own cotton cake every year and buy bean cake produced by others. The costs of this exchange, transportation, commission, and other losses are substantial and must be addressed. In the United States, only cotton cake is used for cotton planting, not bean cake. Furthermore, the results of tests at experimental stations in that country show that cotton cake is more effective for cotton than any other cake. The author's previous experiments at Southeast University also proved that cotton cake applied to cotton fields is no less effective than bean cake or rapeseed cake. It can be seen that cotton cake is a good fertilizer for cotton, without a doubt. However, in our country, due to the planting of wheat in cotton fields in winter, and due to the dry weather followed by rain after the wheat harvest, cotton cake cannot be applied early, so its special benefits are not recognized by the average farmer, which is a great pity. For the present, we should study appropriate methods for applying cotton cake to cotton fields, eliminating its drawbacks and reaping its benefits, which will greatly benefit the economy of farmers in cotton-growing areas. How can this be done? The author is studying this issue at the Agricultural Department of Nantong College, together with the Agronomy and Chemistry departments, studying its fermentation in the laboratory and adding appropriate adjustments before fertilizing ordinary cotton fields, and testing its speed of effectiveness in the field to explore the appropriate time for application. Based on known facts, the author advocates the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton cake is indeed a good fertilizer for cotton, and our country's farmers should pay attention to its use. (2) When fertilizing wheat fields, it is better to use cotton cake as a base fertilizer rather than human manure as a top dressing. If cotton cake is applied in early spring, the remaining power can still benefit cotton development. (3) If cotton cake is used as a top dressing for cotton fields, it should be fermented in advance so that it is easier to see its effect after it is applied to the field. (4) For single-crop cotton fields, if cotton cake is applied early, its effectiveness is at least equal to that of bean cake at the same price. (3) Sowing, Weeding, and Cultivation Issues</p>
<p>Northerners use drills to row-sow all kinds of grains, and cotton is no exception, whether it is American cotton or native cotton. Southern farmers do not know how to use this tool, and row sowing is difficult. Therefore, cotton is mostly broadcast sown, whether it is native cotton or American cotton. American cotton plants are large and require a lot of space, and broadcast sowing often leads to excessively dense seedlings, which is not suitable. Row sowing, with row spacing as wide as two feet or more, does not require much labor, so it is not difficult to promote. However, native cotton plants are smaller and require less space. If row sowing is used, the row spacing should be about 1.2 feet, which requires almost twice as much labor as American cotton. If there are no row-sowing machines and reliance is placed solely on hand hoes, the labor required is very high. Therefore, it is not easy to switch to row sowing when planting native cotton in the South. However, the sowing method for cotton is closely related to the subsequent weeding and cultivation work. In broadcast-sown fields, the position of cotton seedlings is chaotic, and weeding requires a lot of labor. Because of this, hoeing is not done diligently. When there are many weeds, work is only done once out of necessity, and there is rarely hoeing when there are few weeds. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that Southerners only know how to weed cotton, but not how to cultivate it. During the hottest periods of summer, the South sometimes suffers from drought. When cotton is in full bloom, drought causes flower buds and young bolls to fall off, reducing the yield and significantly reducing the color. Examining the causes of this loss, the climate only accounts for a small part. Infrequent cultivation, which fails to maintain loose topsoil and reduce surface evaporation, is largely responsible. Although the South sometimes lacks rain, there are rarely long periods of drought. In cotton fields with loose topsoil, the lower layer of moisture is still sufficient even after a month without rain, and drought is not felt. However, in broadcast-sown fields, the ground is hard and compact, and the amount of moisture lost through surface evaporation is very large. If the rainfall is not particularly favorable and provides a steady supply of moisture, then flower and boll shedding will follow, and drought will appear. Is this the fault of the climate? Or is it self-inflicted? Therefore, cotton fields cannot withstand drought. The immediate cause is the lack of cultivation, and the remote cause is the inappropriateness of broadcast sowing. Tracing back to the source, it is still related to the sowing method! The author's research on this topic is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) American cotton should be row-sown, and native cotton should also be row-sown. However, the row spacing of row-sown native cotton should not be too wide. If it is as wide as 1.6 feet or more, there is a great risk of reducing the harvest. The appropriate row spacing is 1.2 feet in the middle, at least one foot, and at most 1.5 feet. (2) For row-sowing American cotton, the American-style single-row, corn-cotton dual-purpose seeder is the best. The cotton seeder commonly used in the southern United States is second best. (The Agricultural College of Central University and the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory have both copied it.) The northern single-foot drill and double-foot drill can also be used in the South, but those who use them must have experience to be sure of the amount and depth of sowing. It is also okay to open a furrow with a plow, sow in the furrow, and then cover the soil with a rake or hand hoe, but there is a fear of making it too deep. (3) If a single-row seeder is used for row-sowing native cotton in open fields, the work is still slow. The Southern foot drill can sow two rows, which seems more suitable. If there are no ready-made machines, a row-opening tool for wheat breeding can be made (using a 5-foot-long horizontal wooden bar with four to six wedge-shaped wooden teeth nailed onto it, 1 to 1.5 feet apart, which can be moved at will). It opens four to six rows at a time. If the land is leveled, the depth of the furrow is just right. Then use manual sowing and cover the soil with a rake, and the work will not be too slow. (4) For row-sowing native cotton between wheat rows, a hoe must first be used to open a furrow, which costs two more workers per acre. As for sowing and covering the soil, it is the same as broadcast sowing between wheat rows. Although row sowing requires more labor at this time, subsequent weeding and cultivation are very convenient, which can prevent drought and reduce losses, so the benefits are great. (5) Weeding and cultivating between cotton rows with a hoe requires a lot of labor. It is best to use a five-tooth cultivator pulled by a cow, which is very fast. One person and one cow can work 15 to 25 acres per day. However, a row spacing of 1.6 feet is the minimum limit. Smaller than this makes it inconvenient to cultivate with a cow, so this is only applicable to American cotton and not fully applicable to native cotton. If the row spacing of native cotton is 1.2 to 1.5 feet, a common European and American garden hand-pushed cultivator can be used. Each person can work about two acres per day, which is at least twice as fast as using a hand hoe.</p>
<p>(4) Topping and Pruning</p>
<p>In the South, some places top native cotton, and some places do not. In places that top, they top every year, and consider it inappropriate not to top. In places that do not top, they also do not top every year, and consider topping to be unnecessary. Thus, topping or not topping has become a local custom, unchanging, and it seems that each is suitable and cannot be changed in the slightest. In fact, the purpose of topping is to inhibit excessive cotton plant growth, remove the top bud, and promote the development of side branches to facilitate flowering and boll formation, so that the main stem does not shoot straight up, growing tall and large in vain. Therefore, whether topping is necessary should depend on the growth of the cotton plant. Fertile fields are beneficial to cotton plant development, but in dry years, they cannot grow fully due to the limited supply of moisture. Therefore, in fertile fields where topping is the norm, topping is not necessary in dry years. Conversely, cotton plants in poor fields do not develop well and usually do not need to be topped. However, if there is an occasional phenomenon of excessive growth in years with particularly favorable rainfall, topping can also be used to achieve benefits. Furthermore, the diamondback moth causes great damage to flower buds and young bolls. According to experts in cotton pests, the diamondback moth lays its eggs on the tender tips of cotton plants, and the average incubation period of the eggs is 6.5 days. After the larvae hatch, they stay on the tender tips for another 5.5 days before going down to feed on flowers and fruits. Thus, within these 12 days, if topping is done, the eggs and larvae of the diamondback moth can be destroyed at any time. Understanding this, whether cotton should be topped should also depend on the number of diamondback moths and their egg-laying and hatching periods. It cannot be determined by fixed habits.</p>
<p>In the North, there is also a pruning method for planting American cotton. When the cotton seedlings are about a foot tall, if leaf branches sprout at the base, the buds of the sprouted leaf branches are removed. Afterwards, the cotton seedlings grow upwards quickly, and the lower and middle fruit branches also shoot out in all directions. When the seedlings are about 2.5 feet tall, the main bud is removed again. Since the cotton seedlings cannot grow upwards, the lower and middle fruit branches continue to elongate, and the upper fruit branches also catch up, not lagging behind. Soon, the fruit branches each elongate to about a foot or even two feet, with buds and flowers developing at each node, and the tips continuing to elongate. At this time, the tips of each fruit branch are removed again, transferring the energy to the flowers and fruits to promote their boll formation. However, at this time, the cotton plant's growth force is very strong. In addition to flowering and fruiting, small leaf branches sprout at the base of the fruit branches and at each node on the branches, releasing the remaining energy. The pruner removes the sprouted or unsprouted buds of these small leaf branches at any time, so that all the energy can be completely transferred to the bolls and fruits, making them large and numerous, and opening quickly. As such, cotton pruning work requires an additional 7 to 8 to more than 10 workers per acre. However, in the northern provinces, where the growing season is very short and the climate is extremely dry, the success of abundant American cotton harvests is largely due to pruning, which cannot be denied. However, there is room for research into the application of this method. It is feasible in dry climates, but it has not been found suitable in areas with more rainfall. This is because pruning restricts the development of stems and branches, and the number of flowering nodes is limited. If there is continuous rain during flowering, many flowers will fall off. One fallen flower means one less fruit. The main stem and side branches also lose their ability to elongate and cannot continue to flower to make up for the losses, which will inevitably lead to sparse cotton plants and poor harvests, which is not worthwhile. Furthermore, the side branches of pruned cotton plants shoot out in all directions, and the main stem no longer grows upwards. Since space cannot be fully utilized, the distance between rows and plants needs to be widened to allow for their development. Such sparse planting is only suitable for fertile fields and not for poor soils. Cotton plants do not grow large in poor soils, and the distance should be close. If sparse planting is done in preparation for pruning, it is easy to incur losses, so caution must be exercised. Therefore, although pruning is considered feasible in the North, it must be adapted according to different climates and soils.</p>
<p>In conclusion, improving cotton cultivation methods should be implemented differently at any time and in any place, based on the natural environment and the situation of rural society. The above sections are only a few of the more important points in cultivation, used to show its flexibility. It is not possible to identify a method and apply it unchanged, nor can it be said that the way to improve cultivation lies entirely in these points. The reason is that the average farmer in our country adheres to cultivation methods and does not make changes, due to a lack of knowledge and a lack of understanding of the relationship between living organisms and changes in the environment. And those who are just beginning to learn about agriculture, because they have great expectations for agricultural science, also think that once they learn about agriculture, they will know everything and be able to achieve success immediately. But they do not know that the difficulty of improving all industries is greater than that of agriculture, and cotton, as one of the agricultural crops, is of course no exception. The author repeatedly states this idea, hoping that comrades who study agriculture will deeply explore their own specialized subjects, strive for excellence, and not just pursue superficiality and be complacent, so that they cannot benefit the farmers!

<h3>Finance: Foreign Call Loans Continue to Drop Slightly by One Point</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was extremely hot, people were idle, and it was a typical Sunday. Therefore, the atmosphere was exceptionally desolate, almost as if there was no market. In the market, the price of foreign call loans generally decreased. Both morning and afternoon prices were 5 points, a slight decrease of one point from the previous day. The trading of call loan notes was also scarce. The morning turnover was only slightly over 4 million, with 600-700,000 in new trades. The afternoon turnover was slightly over 300,000. The small general association traded slightly over 400,000. Money shops received and settled over 24 million in foreign exchange, and over 400,000 in remittances from various routes. Bank receipts and settlements were not recorded due to the Sunday holiday. Jiangnan small silver coins remained unchanged from the previous day at 840 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets. The turnover was only 4,000 jiao in the morning market. Guangdong small silver coins were 772.4 yuan in the morning market and 772.8 yuan in the afternoon market, with a turnover of 40,000 jiao in the morning market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were slightly lower at 500 wen, at 316,000 wen. The turnover was over 31,000 strings, with a total value of 10,000 yuan in silver.</p>

<h3>Resulted in a Frenzied Rise in Government Bonds Over the Weekend</h3>
<p>| Nine-Six Will Have a Reaction Sooner Rather Than Later!</p>
<p>Last week (July 3rd to 8th), the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was still extremely active. The market did not enter a period of stagnation after settlement, as is usually the case. Initially, the atmosphere was quite dull, and prices fluctuated slightly. Subsequently, due to the signing of the Dalian Agreement, prices gradually strengthened. Finally, due to the sudden rumor of the establishment of the Sino-British loan, prices soared. The trend of Nine-Six gradually shifted from high heat to coolness. At the same time, Whole-Six shifted from stability to frenzy. Examining the reasons for the outcomes, each had its own reasons for rising and falling. Nine-Six initially stirred up speculation with rumors of consolidation. Large numbers of accounts were maintained, and fluctuations were frequent. A rise could potentially see 14-15 yuan, while a fall could still be expected to return to 6-7 yuan. This was the standard for price fluctuations based on the strength of the speculative forces on both sides. Therefore, its rise and fall still had a volatile trend. After the government made revisions, the total amount remaining for Whole-Six was only slightly over 30 million, with no more than a few million in circulation in the market. Investors paid a little attention and were immediately faced with the panic of depleted chips. Therefore, its rise was particularly fierce. The remaining bonds were mostly held by capitalists, with strong defenses that were not easily shaken. The environmental situation was unfavorable to short sellers. The eagerness and enthusiasm of those covering shorts and new longs caused the rise to be straightforward and without signs of weakness. Prices rose daily, and new records were constantly set, with a trend towards reaching a peak. By the weekend, the market had reached its peak, and trading was therefore very active. Here is a detailed account of the process: On Monday, Nine-Six experienced a sudden reaction due to the previous week's frenzy. Northern investors sold aggressively, causing a sudden drop of about two yuan. The rest also experienced small drops of about half a yuan. On Tuesday, prices were initially small and then recovered. Various investors gradually had demand, and prices rose slightly by 3-4 jiao. Nine-Six gradually stabilized. On Wednesday, the market was relatively chaotic, but still rose by 3-5 jiao. Large investors gradually covered their shorts, and demand from Northern investors was also strong. During these three days, Nine-Six transitioned from chaos to peace, generally from stability to strength. However, due to high prices, the number of short sellers increased significantly, which led to the frenzied rise in the second half of the week. On Thursday, the signing of the Dalian Agreement suddenly put short sellers at a disadvantage. However, because Northern investors and Number 11 suddenly emerged, the rise was not strong. Number 16 gradually covered their shorts, and demand for Whole-Six was particularly strong, rising by 8-9 jiao. On Friday, there was a sudden rumor of the establishment of the Sino-British loan, causing a frenzied rise in the afternoon. The rise of Whole-Six was the most fierce. On Saturday, the rising trend continued. Number 16 and Northern investors bought the most. The rising trend of Whole-Six was particularly fierce. As a result of the week, prices rose from one yuan several jiao to three yuan. Whole-Six rose sharply by about five yuan. The situation was excellent. At least the discounts were all above 60%. Among them, only Nine-Six rebounded and fell by 8-9 jiao. Being mindful of danger despite high position is an ancient saying. There will be a reaction sooner rather than later. One must not cause a major drop. The total turnover was 86,298,500 yuan, including 28,500 yuan in spot trades. Futures were mostly in Nine-Six, accounting for 18,510,000 alone. Salt Tax was 16,090,000, Consolidated Tax was 10,500,000, Disarmament was 8,260,000, 19-Customs was 8,620,000, 20-Customs was 14,510,000, and Whole-Six Disarmament was 7,680,000. The rest ranged from 300,000 to over 1 million. Cotton Yarn</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Consistently Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was awaiting the government report. It initially fell due to long covering, and then strengthened due to short covering. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 1-5 points. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot prices fell by 25 points, and futures prices fell by 1-2 points. In the Egyptian cotton market, spot prices fell by 24 points. The Bombay cotton market initially weakened following American cotton, and then fell due to long covering. As a result, Bengal fell by 6 rupees 2.5 annas, Oomra fell by 5 rupees 2.5 annas, and Broach fell by 8 rupees.</p>

<h3>Deliberations on Summer Vacation Life</h3>
<p>— Qi Ling</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, a week of summer vacation has passed. This long period of two months, with hot and stuffy days, makes it worthwhile to discuss what work to plan for during the summer vacation. Previously, Tianlong Jun of this publication had already written about it, and his idea was to focus on studies, sports, and so on. The plan is certainly good, but I think that in addition to reviewing homework and sports, we should also do some work. Now, let me write it out and discuss it with those of higher intelligence.</p>
<p>(1) Social Observation Work</p>
<p>First, let me ask: "Is our studying preparing us for future use in society?" If so, then we can take advantage of this long summer vacation to follow our fathers, brothers, or relatives and friends, as long as they are working in society, to observe the customs, human relationships, and hospitality of social work. No matter what industry, we can go and take a look. Because the various aspects of society are absolutely different from those in school. Since we are preparing to dedicate ourselves to society in the future, why not prepare in advance and gain some experience? As the saying goes, "Experience is knowledge." This will save us from experiencing many inconveniences when we go to work in society.</p>
<p>(2) Rural Survey Work</p>
<p>China's rural areas are bankrupt! Just look at the fact that in the past, we were known as a country founded on agriculture, but now we are constantly importing foreign rice and foreign wheat, which is a very obvious confirmation. Young students often claim to be the future masters of China, and they often have slogans about going to the countryside. Even new movies often use this as promotional material. However, all the talk is just flowery words that could make a stubborn stone nod its head, but in reality, I dare ask if anyone has ever gone to the countryside to investigate. It goes without saying. We students usually spend all day in school and have few opportunities to get close to the rural masses. Why not take advantage of this summer vacation to travel together and investigate everything in the countryside to see what the lives of farmers are like? Study the reasons for rural bankruptcy. I think that what we gain from practical work experience is much more relevant than what we find in books. Moreover, we can also take this opportunity to experience some outdoor life, which is a multiple win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<p>(3) Trying Teaching Work</p>
<p>There are too many illiterate people in China! In terms of population, there are more than 470 million people, but in fact, half of them are blind with their eyes open. Now, the people of the country are actively seeking remedies, so summer literacy schools are being established in many places. We may as well do our duty and be a teacher, on the one hand to observe our own teaching ability, and on the other hand to benefit the common people of society not a little.</p>
<p>(4) Practicing Submission Work</p>
<p>Of course, what we learn must be put into practice, but the school gives us too few opportunities to write essays and compete. At the same time, we have no time to practice. During the summer vacation, we are idle, and we can write some manuscripts based on the results of social observation, rural surveys, and our own personal feelings and essays, and submit them to newspapers or magazines. Whether the writing is good or bad and whether there is any hope of publication is another question, and there is no need to worry about it. It is important to practice our own writing skills. If it is published, to put it bluntly, we can also get some manuscript fees to supplement our pocket money, because our parents have already spent a lot of money on us in a year.</p>
<p>Integrating the above four types of work, the third item should be done in the morning, the fourth item should be done in the evening, and the first and third items do not need to be fixed. In our spare time, we can review our homework, exercise, and rest as usual on Sundays. In this way, if we can do it conscientiously, we will not let down this long summer vacation. Otherwise, watching movies, reading novels, visiting parks, and indulging in debauchery, we can never admit that he is a youth of the era.</p>
<h3>What's the Use of Just Crying Out! The River Rises Daily</h3>
<h3>Sweet Dream</h3>
<p>— Mo Juan</p>
<p>It was the twilight hour when the setting sun hid in the western mountains.</p>
<p>The azure sky, the blue water, the entire universe, were all decorated with scarlet by the evening glow. At this time, I was wandering in a richly furnished hall, with everything from painted beams and carved rafters to gemstones, crystals, embroidered curtains, and so on. This was a palace with a rich ancient Roman atmosphere. At that time, I thought to myself, I had reached my ideal destination of a palace and paradise.</p>
<p>As I was pondering, the doorbell suddenly rang. As the beaded curtain was lifted, Lily walked in gracefully. Today, she was particularly beautiful and moving, wearing a river-green cheongsam that was slightly bulged at the chest, accentuating her slender waist, making her curves even richer!</p>
<p>"Hello! Darling! Are you feeling lonely?" she said with a charming smile, her delicate voice as melodious as a shattered crystal bottle.</p>
<p>At that moment, my whole body floated up, as happy as an angel in the glow, and I said happily, "Come on! My Queen! Come! I need you to accompany me!"</p>
<p>At this time, the Moon Goddess had already emerged from the mountains. She peeked at our secrets, already too shy to hide in the floating clouds. Ah! I never thought that this weak me would have such courage tonight, boldly embracing her and kissing her sweetly.</p>
<p>Strange, my mother called out, and I woke up. Where was she? Everything had vanished, and before my eyes was a moonlit night, a vast darkness. Alas! Dreams are not permanent, and sweet dreams are even more empty. Only a real life earned through hard work is sweet and happy.</p>

<p>Clerk Correspondence</p>
<h3>Tears of an Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a small clerk in a large store, and my monthly salary is a little over ten yuan, which is barely enough to make ends meet. Eight years ago, my beloved mother unfortunately passed away. At that time, my father married a woman, who became my stepmother. In the second month, she bought a daughter, and the treatment at that time was still good. Later, after my stepmother gave birth to a daughter, she began to abuse the purchased daughter, scolding her all day long and often beating her. Alas! My poor sister endured hardships for five years, and this year she is already eighteen years old. But my stepmother has recently intensified her efforts to force her to marry a regimental commander. But this regimental commander is already over thirty years old and is already married! Although it is said that his wife has already died, there are still doubts. My snobbish stepmother, for the sake of a rich betrothal gift, is forcing my sister to marry him. As for her? She is extremely unwilling to marry him. Under pressure, she can only weep in secret and has repeatedly sought suicide. My relationship with her is very good, and I am also her brother. How can I bear to see her die without saving her? Unfortunately, I am just a small clerk, and my finances are so tight. I have the will but not the power! Now, I am at my wit's end. Alas! When it comes to the point of no return, I can only sacrifice myself and my sister together and end our unfortunate lives. But before I die, I respectfully and sincerely beg you, sir, to point us to a bright path. If we can resist the stepmother's conspiracy and gain freedom, then my sister will have a savior. Not only will we thank you, sir, but even my deceased mother will not forget your great kindness! Sir, you are compassionate and will not reject the request of a dying person, will you? I respectfully wish you good health. Respectfully, Lu Shaoquan</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Buying and selling people is fundamentally not allowed by law. The relationship between your sister and your stepmother can at most be considered that of an unadopted daughter. If she has abusive behavior, your sister can claim to break off the relationship. Now, she is not only abusing her on weekdays but is also blinded by profit, forcing her to marry a man of an inappropriate age, disregarding her lifelong happiness. Of course, she already has the conditions to claim to break off the mother-daughter relationship. However, handling these procedures requires hiring a lawyer and going to court, which I fear will be difficult for your underage sister and your financially strapped self. There is a women and children's relief association in this city that specializes in rescuing women and children in distress. Why doesn't your sister go to them for help? They are used to handling this kind of thing and will definitely have a satisfactory solution. In addition, they also have very kind and experienced mentors who can give your sister accurate guidance on her future path. × × × × ×</p>

<h3>Under the Red and Green Lights (22)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>"Have the 19th Route Army been defeated these past two days?"</p>
<p>The two of them shook their heads in disappointment again, saying:</p>
<p>"They are still winning battles!"</p>
<p>"No matter what, they won't be able to hold out for long, because we have no support, and they will eventually be defeated!" Changfa said with certainty. He had to encourage them to work hard. If he said the Japanese were being defeated, he was afraid they wouldn't be energetic enough.</p>
<p>"Today, all the workers in the yarn factory are not working. These things are really powerful!" This yarn factory is of course referring to a certain Japanese yarn factory.</p>
<p>"That's the only way the factory will be willing to take out more money!"</p>
<p>"Well, then, it's all or nothing tonight. You have to be careful and call more people." Changfa felt that Azhen would eventually be his wife. Look!</p>
<p>"Understood! Understood!"</p>
<p>"Tonight, Master Yang will definitely come here. If it's done well, come here!"</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll go first."</p>
<p>At the door, they ran into Li Shiqiao, Wang Hua, and Hu Yuanliang.</p>
<p>Energetic, he was always the most energetic.</p>
<p>"We will send out a telegram tomorrow to express our attitude." He suggested.</p>
<p>"What's the use of one or two weak organizations? We need to find more powerful organizations to participate in the signing." It was Shiqiao who spoke.</p>
<p>"That's easy, just write a few more!" Hu Yuanliang and Wang Hua were originally the same kind of people. "We have to hurry! Look, didn't Ma Kefa organize a party affairs group with just one telegram! If someone else takes the lead, our various people's organizations ×××× Association will not be the second."</p>
<p>The majority agreed.</p>
<p>Shiqiao Paper did not make a sound. So his house was used as a temporary office, and everyone began to draft, copy, and then stamp, seal the envelopes, write the announcements to the newspapers, and request that they be published in large print for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>
