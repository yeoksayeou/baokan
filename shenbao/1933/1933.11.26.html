<h3 id="c18">時評　滿鐵改組問題時 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>滿洲事變爆發以來。日本軍部獨裁的傾向。一天一天的具體化了。所謂人材主義的舉國一致的齋藤内閣。實際上全受軍部的支配。舉凡一切的内政外交。政黨財閥與軍部之間。雖則時常發現矛盾。但結果總是遷就軍部的意旨。</p>
<p>日本軍部獨裁。的氣熖發揮得最澈底的。是在侵華政策上。過去日本在華的一切軍事行動。都由日本軍部自由行動。「滿洲僞國」成立後。所謂「三位一體」的武藤。兼領了關東軍司令官。關東廳長官。日本駐滿全權大使的職。務。這便是以一軍閥包辦滿洲的軍事。行政和外交。</p>
<p>現在。日本軍閥的魔手又更進而伸張到日本在滿洲的經濟機構了。日本關東軍最近提出的滿鐵改組案。就是要實現這種新的企圖。</p>
<p>南滿鐵道株式會社。是變相的日本企圖吞併滿洲的東印度公司。資本已達八萬萬元。執行業務機關的職員。都由日本政府任免。已不是單純的商業組織。而形成日本對滿經濟侵略的國營企業了。在其支配下。除鐵道企業外。有礦業·一般工業·船舶業·以及電氣·航空·等業。舉。舉凡滿洲的一切重要企業。都有滿鐵勢力滲入。實際上已形成了所謂「日滿統制經濟」的主體。正因滿鐵這樣的重要性。當然終於逃不出包攬一切的軍部的魔手。</p>
<p>關東司令部提出的「滿鐵改組案」的内容。綜括一般的消息。不外下列幾個要點。</p>
<p>（一）舉凡滿洲的一切經營。都由關東軍管轄。而與拓務部無關。</p>
<p>（二）指導機關的成員。應由現在關東軍的特務部員和滿鐵經濟調查會屬員的一部擔任。</p>
<p>（三）滿鐵經營各企業。須在一國一業的方針下。依企業訓而使之獨立。滿鐵自身則改組爲一種特殊公司。專從事於資金的吸收和新公司的育成。</p>
<p>（四）實施期定於明年四月以後。但須於今冬的議會完成一切的法律手續。自從軍部提出改組滿鐵的意見後。日本國内政界·財界·滿鐵股東職員方</p>
<p>面。都表示反對。尤其拓務部及滿鐵職員反對得特别激烈。前者主要是由於管轄職權移動問題。後者是由於改組後的生活脅威問題。爭執漸漸地擴大。但結局恐如現在軍事預算的矛盾一樣。最後的勝利。還是屬之軍部。</p>
<p>那麽軍部提出改組滿鐵的動機是什麽呢。</p>
<p>日本政府的滿鐵股票所有額雖屬不少。但民間也佔有半數以上爲什麽指導成員竟屬之關東軍的經濟參謀本部呢。又滿鐵所經營的各企業中獲利最豐富的。只有鐵道企業。他如礦山商業以及地方經營等事業都虧空甚巨。如果個别地獨立經營。當然要使一部份股東受到很大的損失。經營上也要受到致命的打擊。軍部並不是没有看到這一點。但是爲什麽要使之分解作用呢。不待說。這是與最近日蘇間關係的惡化和未來的日蘇戰爭。有極大的關係。</p>
<p>日蘇戰爭一旦爆發滿洲當然是首當其衝。它不僅是在戰略地帶。而且是戰爭資源的供給地。現在在滿鐵統制下的各種企業。將來對戰爭要發揮很大的作用。軍部爲了使作戰的資源可以自由取給。怎能冉顧到滿鐵本身經營的利益。惟有感覺握於手中的必要。而且要急於實施這種主張。</p>

<p>江大足球錦標賽、昨有重要一戰、交通復旦、會師徐家滙、奪决賽權、因曁南必得决賽權、而交通復旦之外、未能有與曁南决戰之力也、昨日交大球場、圍觀者如堵、兩隊勢均力敵、在内喊助威啦啦如雷震之下、劇戰八十五分鐘、未分高下、卒於最後之五分鐘、爲交大周光中、射中一球、遂分勝負、裁判員沈回春、</p>
<h3 id="c202">一攻一守 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>交大善於攻、復旦善於守、燧造成昨日之局面、交大五鋒聯絡甚佳、中線亦能托輔、沈觀瀾中堅甚堅、於是常見盤旋復旦門前、但復旦後方全爲大將、楊銘全之守門、當稱佼佼、加以關洵安張容之後衛、故昨日之戰、實爲進攻與退守之較量、惜乎交大前鋒無脚頭、否大交大已早勝矣、</p>
<h3 id="c203">零與零比 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>上半時之四十五分鐘、全是交大局面、猛攻復旦不已、陳公輿達送一球、萬象華得之而狂奔、奈中鋒脚軟、失之交臂、繼而右翼薛文繡之妙送、同光中跳起欲頂、楊銘全跳起、經輕一拍、球落左翼、爲狀極險、萬象華搶上未得、此上半時中之一二幕也、一攻一守、上半時成零比零、</p>

<p>下半時各易一二將、復旦曾現中興氣象反攻殊烈、王文靖在左翼曾二次前衝其勢殊猛、一次余順章欲頂而未得、周紹文等均下死力、但漸現力疲之狀、交大之反攻又來、萬象華三次攻門、皆未得手、和局之勢已成、不料於最後五分鐘、薛文繡在左翼盤上、一脚傳中、在不留意之時、周光中已閃人門前、輕打而中、關洵安竟不及防備、如此一脚、奠定乾坤、</p>

<p>（南京二十五日電）江大足球曁南對全陵、二十五下午三時、在金大球場比賽、裁判張信孚、開球後、曁南來勢甚猛、屢向金陵進攻、歷四十分鐘、由徐亞輝踢進一球、上局成一與零之比、下局開始後、曁南進攻尤猛、未四分鐘、復由曁南符和萱送進一球、至此金陵大勢已去、雖欲反攻、奈因曁南攻守咸宜、終不得逞、最後復被徐亞輝攻進一球、致下局又成二與零之比、結果曁南以三比零勝金陵、</p>

<p>臘克斯昨戰優游、前鋒後衛、均有可觀之處、上半時優游雖以二對一居於上屬地位、唯時時處於對方極度之壓迫下、形勢實爲不妙、下半時開塲未久、卽爲臘隊中堅遥射一脚、迫成和局、此後優游護曾再以三對二領前、但不久卽爲臘隊追出、而以四對三獲勝、一部份觀衆、感情用事、對於優游表示種種不滿、此不獨不應如此、且亦有失觀者應有態度也、</p>

<p>優游開球、臘隊半途截得、大舉反攻、屢屢追成角球、故優游門前險象環生、幸王樹森匹馬單槍、屢屢救阿斗於重圍之外、祇以臘隊前鋒、窮攻不已、驅之不去、黃瑞華頂出一球、爲賽門斯所得、就近交與阿爾傑、西陲多事、中樞動摇、哈伯克爲王樹森所嬲乃偷度金針、路特見臘心喜、拉起一脚球、逾入門、</p>
<h3 id="c212">回敬二隻 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>臘隊得一球後、氣燄更盛、唐永純生意大忙、拳打足賜、十分鐘内、苟且偷安、孫鐵腿重重怒發、統率三軍、節節反攻、阿巧滑頭滑腦、使人捉摸不定、轉瞬卽入後防、一脚挑人中樞、孫鐵腿脚上擺渡、李碩友欲射不能、跌了一交、無何李碩友得奚巧生之助、聞人罰球區域、孫錦順邀住琴生厮殺、小李得隙射門、遂成平分秋色、混戰十分鐘、陳家球派與奚巧生、阿巧再轉交鍾男森、稍一停頓、球至鐵腿之下、一撥進門、成二對一、反敗爲勝、</p>
<h3 id="c213">又佔先着 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>休息後、臘隊在西僑鼓掌呐喊之下、頗有作爲、進攻之聲勢、極見浩大、黃瑞華兩度送球出險、尤不能保全疆土、賽門斯於七分鐘時、混人優游之中衛線、乘人不備、力射一記、唐永純措手不及、又成和局、阿爾傑曾入選於埠際隊、其身手之矯儘、不問可知、兩次以平急之球、傳送至優游門前、路特兩頂不着、遂惱動孫錦順、興師北伐、單兵匹馬、疾如屬雨、琴洛兩後衛、二馬來過、招架不得、柯克倫心荒意亂、擅離老巢、遂爲孫氏打入空門、成三對二、</p>

<p>優游再度領前之後、氣燄始終不能延長、數度來回之後、臘隊反攻熱烈、哈伯克監視孫錦順、賽門斯阻止李石友、阿爾傑東郊放馬、入莊世鴻守衛區域、傳與哈伯克、在優游發球線外、糾纒已時、鮑塞列凑退一脚、唐永純之視線、爲兩後衛所遮、迨瞥見球影、挽救不及、乃從其看際倒滑入網、未幾賽門斯又在三十碼處、得機開砲、造成四三局面、此後孫錦順雖有兩次峻急射門、惜稍偏不入、竟以三對四、施高塔盃淘汰、</p>

<h3 id="c230">哀蟹 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>「九月團臍十月尖。」湖蟹早又上市了。那酒肆或野味店門前都設着鐵絲籠。籠裡的無腸公子們，都口吐白沫，横行斜上，爬個不停，似欲脫柙而出；可是因爲它們畢竟没有像虎兕的氣力那麽大，所以祇好悉悉索索，短嘆長吁。推測它們的心理：誰没有還我自由的希冀？又誰没有脫離異族丨人類丨侵凌的願望？然而它們的大敵，方食指大動，必欲一快朶願，那末公子可憐，也祇可在不抵抗之下，斷送着生命了。</p>
<p>蟹是横行的，它又是冷血的。惟其横行，所以它僅能在自夥道裡稱雄。惟其冷血，所以它的同類被人們一串一串地紥去以供大嚼，它還是漠然無動於中。是故照「適者生存」的公例說來，蟹之見食於人，原是「自作孽，不可活」，用不着我們丨人丨去哀它的。這是指活蟹而言。　　至於死蟹，論理，人總有不忍之心，不會把它作下酒物了。可是蟹擬之上，一隻一隻還紮得緊緊的羅列着，白白的臍兒朝着天，口裘也不再吐着白沫，短嘆長吁。這種死蟹，自然一輩持螯對菊的人兒所不屑一顧的；但是那些穿短服的朋友對之，却有嗜痂之癖。據說，蟹在將死未死的當兒，它的脂膏依舊是很肥厚的，此時不吃，更待何時！况且死蟹總比活蟹容易制伏。活蟹還有兩隻巨螯可以自衛，人們對之不免總有戒心；如今它已將死了，兩螯亦失其抵抗之能力，脂膏自可供人大嚼了。是故活蟹與死蟹兩兩相較，似乎死蟹較爲可哀、尤其是將死的蟹更爲可哀。</p>
<p>不知如何，我每走過蟹攤邊，看到籠裏的活蟹，籠外的死蟹，總有些觸目驚心，因作哀蟹。</p>
<h3 id="c231">蟹異 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 金孑</p>
<p>蟹，在這個時季裏提起蟹字，誰聽了部會　得很動心的，尤其是用蟹來做題目，眞可算是最廳時的文章了。但是，我這裏所預備寫的却不是研究什麽青背，紅爪，工字文，一類的蟹譜，更不是那些已死的名流食蟹的軼史；乃是幾　似乎很神異的小故事，可不是自欺欺人的神話！</p>
<p>有一個深秋的早晨，那時；我還没有成年咧，但是對於蟹的滋味已早知道了，所以到了大蟹上市的時節，也往往隨着大人們持螯酌酒作樂，這一天，我同幾個小朋友到某一條小河裏去弄船，那邊恰好有人張着蟹斷在河中捉蟹，我們便瞧著他把漏夜攔在　裏的蟹一隻一隻的捉起來，大的，小的，倒是眞不少；後來他忽然捉起了一個三隻蟹相連的小集團事，上了岸還是不見分開，不但我們都覺得很奇怪，就是那個捉蟹的人也表示非常的詫異，於是他就用力把他們分開來一看，才知道中間那隻蟹是失掉了八條腿的跛子，所以旁邊兩隻蟹便抬着他在河中走了。我那時候知識有限，一味祇覺得好玩，如今相想，便不由不讚嘆那兩隻蟹的義氣了！</p>
<p>還有我家佃户中有個名喚周大蟹的人，乃是一個出名的大力土，鄕下人打起相打來，祇要那一方面有他加入，那一方面便贏定了。據說他能夠徒手打死一條水牛，還能夠把井邊的石欄高高地舉起來。關於打死一頭牛的本領我是没有看見過，但是舉起井石攔的一幕，却確曾在我面前表演過。當時，我就問他何以會有這樣大的力氣。他說：「我在十六歲之前，還是一個極尋常的人，跟别人打架，往往不支而逃；這一年的秋天，有事上洞庭山去，住在一個朋友的家裏，朋友是漁翁，到秋天總是　捉蟹過日子的。有一晚我恰巧有興，就跟着他一起去工作，不知怎樣一下子，忽然給我們捉到了一隻足足比大花碗更大的大蟹，連腿算在裡面，横度定在二尺以上，我一見便食指大動，忙求朋友留給我下酒，朋友說，這樣大的蟹，恐怕有害，勸我不要吃。但是我瞧那蟹也别無特　之點，便終於煮熟吃了。從此，我的力氣就在不知不覺之中增加起來，尤其是兩條謗子」。上面的話都是那個周大蟹親口所說，並經旁人證實的，可是這個傢伙，後來也祇是默默無聞的死了，並不曾怎樣利用他的大力氣。</p>
<h3 id="c232">蟹脚 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>故天書家李梅庵氏，别署清道人，生平最愛蟹，一口氣能吃一百隻，人稱李百蟹。這是吃蟹的最高紀錄。</p>
<p>清代詩人吳榖人氏，剪燈小集絶句云：蟹天霜信最先知，橘後光隂與爾期，感舊不禁酸一點，吳姫筵上手搓時。」「蟹天」二字很新。</p>
<p>美國故總統哈定氏·Ｈarding前幾年忽然暴卒，一時報紙爭傳，都說是中的蟹毒。近有人却著書力辯其非，說他的死另有别情，那也不可考了。</p>
<p>關於蟹的專書很少，宋代却有兩部，一爲傳肱的蟹譜，分上下二卷。一爲高似孫的解略，共四卷，叙述最詳，唐代有蟹志，出詩人陳龜蒙手。清代褚人穫繼傳肱之後，有續蟹譜之作。這四位先生，可算是無腸公子的知已。</p>
<p>蟹有最小的一種，名虱蟹，蟹殼纔如杏仁大·浸以好醬油·隔日取食，味很鮮美，可作下酒物。</p>
<p>清名士朱其恭愛蟹，一天正在飲酒劈蟹，闇人報有八座來拜，其恭叱道：「我不以八座易八脚！」仍自管吃他的蟹。詩人李紫翔贈詩，有「惟呼濁酒澆狂客，自喜霜螯勝熱官」之句，當時傳爲佳話。</p>
<p>前年新世界游獻塲，陳列一隻美人蟹，曾經轟動一時，蟹殼上面自如畫，宛然是一個風神絶世的美人兒，的是蟹中異種。</p>
<p>巧對錄載：「有御史巡松江者，郡守故人留之飲，因戲出對曰：鑪魚四鰓，一尾獨占松江。守曰：螃蟹八足，兩螯横行天下。御史知其諷已，亦爲一噱。」今日之兩螯横行天下者，又何其多呢？</p>
<p>以上共八則，適符蟹脚之數。</p>
<h3 id="c233">煮蟹 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>一串蟹，倒懸着。「吱哩吱哩」吐着白涎沫，兩粒眼殊子小的可以，兩隻螯又大的可以，八條腿，有幾隻蟹已成了殘廢，這是被捉解的人和蟹販子摧殘所致，使我聯想到後方醫院裏的傷兵，然而，他們和它們一樣還是等待着被殺戮的一羣。</p>
<p>瞧它們的形態是怪可憐的，腿不時在伸縮，是强欲掙扎的樣子。想這些小生命横行在沙縛蘆葦裏的時候，多麽自由自在啊。而現在給灘住了，要一隻一隻放到鍋中烹煮，要一爿一爿被人撕食。</p>
<p>我喜吃蟹而不忍看煮蟹。</p>
<p>煮蟹的一幕，會使人觸類旁通的想到在一切災難中逃命者的狼狽。</p>
<p>先是，一隻隻活鮮鮮的蟹被捉進鍋子，鍋子是冷的，水亦是冷的，蟹在裏面覺得奸過，「吱華吱嘩」爬着，可是水一些些暖起來了，爬聲逐漸緊密，逃命的脚步是錯亂的，水燙啦，有些爬上半鍋又「咯」的滑下，滑下的又爬上，爬上又滑下……「吱嘩吱嘩」的聲響稀疏了，已單單聽到些水沸的「咕哆咕哆」聲，鍋蓋縫裡的水蒸氣直冒。它們的生命全完了。開出鍋來，只是一堆穿血衣的屍身。</p>
<p>還有醉蟹，用酒把它們麻醉了塞在　裏。還有麵漿蟹，都在廚子手裏給腰斬。生吞活剥，備受酷刑。在水深火熱中的小民，無異於蟹。然而，煮蟹的人爲了是要吃蟹，煮小民的人，難道也要小民吃不成！</p>
<p>持鰲賞菊的雅士們，暫且放下這杯酒，聽一聽在災難中的呻吟。</p>
<h3 id="c234">蟹的趣話 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 秉謙</p>
<p>幾陣秋風秋雨之後，郊野的景色，早是垂柳含哀，楓葉摇紅了。街頭巷尾，賣蟹的喊聲，不絶如縷，使人連想到持螯對酒的韻事。</p>
<p>京滬一帶的蟹，以産自洋澄湖爲最佳，肉的嫩腴鮮美，久已膾炙人口。我執敎吳門，近在咫尺，在事實上，當不難嘗佳味，可是上市的蟹，奇貨自居，每隻恒須一金，非我輩竊敎員所能染指，加之學生的卷子，堆得滿桌，也無暇及時行樂，在萬般無聊中，述一段關於蟹的趣話，藉作過屠門的大嚼吧！</p>
<p>事是在遜清順治年間。主角是張玉書和陽湖縣丨現在併入武進縣丨縣長吳某。</p>
<p>張玉書是個忠介耿直兩袖清風的賢宰相，他生平最仇視貪官污吏。晚年退居林園，回到故里鎭江，他却不抱「不在其位，不謀其政」的宗旨，還要時常微服出行，喬裝鄕下土老，去解决許多民間的不平。所以附近的地方官碰到這位老頭兒，都有點不寒而慄。</p>
<p>陽湖縣長吳某，雖是官祗九品，却炙手可熱。聯絡地方紳士，魚肉鄕民。這些消息，傳到張老頭兒耳朶裡，遂改扮一個塾師先生，親詣陽湖，謀爲敎讀。循循善誘，頗得縣長的讚賞。没有多時，署内大宴紳士，張老頭兒也在被邀之列。是日也，履曷交錯，盛極一時。入席的時候，大家推讓，没有人肯坐首席，末了推到張玉書，却毫不客氣。大家肚皮裏滿不高興，經誚的目光，不約而同的都集中在張老頭兒身上。第一盤菜是蟹粉，在未下動筷令之前，都要請西席咏一首闕於蟹的詩。在他們的意思，不過是存心捉弄罷了。大才的張玉書，正可借題發揮，不假思索的說：</p>
<p>八隻脚兒渾淪敦。</p>
<p>大家聽見這句旣蠢且俗的詩句，和戯院裏喝倒彩般的閧堂大笑，笑聲還没有靜止，接着第二句是：</p>
<p>誰知腹内有黃金。</p>
<p>這才像吃橄欖似的有點甘甜回味。末了兩句，是一口氣說出的：</p>
<p>兩箝推開前程浪，</p>
<p>那怕陽湖萬里深。</p>
<p>大家都聽出弦外餘昔，曉得是張老頭兒的花樣，匍匐候命，不敢仰視。張老頭兒大大的敎訓了他們一番，不待終席，就飄然步出衙署去了。</p>
<p>我們在　坐吃蟹的時候，講點關於蟹的故事，不更可增加興趣嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c235">紹興的蟹 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 葉菊芙</p>
<p>上海所最通行的要算是洋澄湖的大蟹。這種蟹，大而且肥，殼有些發黃，不爲過了洋澄湖的水很清，所以出産的蟹就成了名。其實最好，吃的蟹，要算是紹興所産的。紹興的内河，由東到西二百里，由南到北也有百餘里，從前的山隂會稽蕭山三縣，周　千餘里，盡是大河大湖，水味的鮮潔，什麽地方也不能及。紹興所産的大蟹，味道的鮮美，可以稱得起冠絶全國。年年在秋深的時候，内河鄕村的漁人，築起竹壩來，月黑風高的當兒，無腸公子就成羣的横行而來，團的在先，横的在後，一羣之中，大約以團的占十之八九，長的祗有占十之一二。有人說：「蟹是採多妻制度的。」鄕農因爲要嘗美味，於是夜裏拚了不睡覺，澈宵伺候，黃昏過後，悉悉率率的來了。它們每逢過壩，是不彎旱道的，鄕民就用燈一照，唾手而得。一批幾十隻。的殼堅硬，好比鐵石，明日沽酒數斤，煮而大嚼，洋澄湖的蟹眞望塵莫及呢。</p>
<p>我幼時在紹興讀書的時候，每年終須吃次稻蟹（紹興人名呌稻蟹三年之前，由廣東回來，到紹興去省親，已經學會了喝酒。我那親戚家裏，曉得我歡喜這個玩意兒，他們預備了許多的菜，魚呀，蝦呀，肉呀，尤其是嘗過的紹興大蟹，至今思之，猶有很鮮美的餘味呢。</p>
<h3 id="c236">本常識　吃蟹常識 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>黃菊破蕊，丹楓染脂，正是持螯把酒的時候，可是蟹雖然味美，但對於人的營養上很有妨碍，所以嗜蟹的人，倒不可以不懂得吃蟹的常識。</p>
<p>蟹的煮法在選擇蟹的時候，須擇其甲堅的，二大螯，宜揀都有毛的，八爪都呈露金黃色，爪上之毛，也要黃，這種蟹可稱膏豐螯肥，如果遇到獨螯蟹，或螯上没有毛的，吃下肚去，很容易致病。煮蟹方法，先要把蟹用硬毛板刷洗凈，把蟹睛中的泥擠去，在睛中放入食鹽數粒，生姜一片，用蔴繩紮好，鍋中放入紫蘇葉少些，隔水蒸熟，它的味道一定鮮美異常。▲食蟹中毒的治療方法因爲蟹是水産動物之一，足使維他命殺滅，體質素弱的人，吃了很易中毒，中毒的人，大都患腹痛最多，倘因吃蟹而患腹痛。可食龍眼肉數錢，痛止毒解。娠姙的婦女，千定不能吃蟹，恐有墮胎之虞，因爲中藥上有一墮胎方，就是蟹爪湯，縱使吃蟹後，未必個個墮胎，但是總嫌太寒凉了。有孕的婦女，忌食很多，例如食兎肉令子缺唇，食雀肉令子多淫。</p>
<p>鮮蟹貯藏法要把鮮蟹貯藏起來，使它不死，並且要使它肉和膏更豐美，那不是很難的嗎？我倒有一個方法，用一隻小髮、髮内貯半髮的稻，把鮮蟹放入，上再覆稻，放在黑暗的地方，一年半載，把蟹取出煮食，那蟹腹一定有很美的膏油，但是髮中的榖，却已變了空殼了▲蟹和杭相反蟹是寒凉的，柿子也很寒凉，查本草綱目，見蟹和柿最忌，犯的人或死或病，我勸吃蟹的朋友，吃了柿子不要吃蟹。吃了蟹不要吃柿子爲妙。請勿以生命爲兒戯！</p>
<p>▲蟹在醫藥上的效用諸君在吃蟹的時候，幸勿忘記！把蟹背和蟹腹分離的時候，内有蟹義衣，隨手趁熱取下，在寒冬生凍瘃的地方擦之。到了冬天，你一定會奇怪你的凍瘃今年爲什麽不生？把蠻殼聚在一塊，到夏天，把它磨成粉，拌入木屑，燃燒起來，就可殺滅蚊蟲，是很靈騐的。</p>
<p>▲蟹和尚是病魔蟹的背殼中，有形似和尚這麽一個，味略苦鹹，吃蟹的朋友，快不要吃它，因爲吃了它，很容易病魔上身。</p>
<p>蟹的燉食法蟹可以燉食，把蟹洗凈復，放入碗中，加醬沺，食鹽，好酒，猪油，在飯鍋上燉食，飲酒下飯都好，並且非常簡便。</p>

<h3 id="c260">論踢屁股 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>中國社會只有兩種階級、踢人家屁股者，及預備屁股給人家踢者。讀書上學就是預備將來踢人家屁股的門路。（參　文學卷一期五達生篇）</p>
<p>同是一副屁股，給外人踢比給國人踢榮幸。同一隻脚，踢國人比踢外人有勁。</p>
<p>被外人踢屁股者常要向被國人踢屁股者誇耀。被國人踢屁股者常要向被外人踢屁股者表示欽羨曰：「胡爲我後？」</p>
<p>奴才最善獻屁股，一旦得志，亦最善踢人家屁股。</p>
<p>儒家定位」之說，是呌踢屁股者放心踢，呌被踢屁股者安分被踢。但安分之說總有點未足，故必益以道家爲天卜谿之說，其中有消極與積極之别。「安分」只是安分而已，坐待可以不必安分之時，並非滿意；爲天下谿，常德不離，則以居下爲得勢，以屁股被踢爲樂。故中國人得意時信儒敎，以踢人屁股爲代天行敎，失意時信老莊，以屁股被踢爲得天。故中國人得遇時深覺廟堂之美，不遇時深覺山林之美。</p>
<p>弄堂中兩個小孩打架，拳頭大的信儒敎，拳頭小的信道敎。</p>
<p>踢屁股有天才，戲屁股亦有本性。天才應踢人家屁股而忽遇屁股不願被踢，則英雄無用武之地，必駡其人如何如何。本性要獻屁股求人踢而覓不到主人者，必飲酒賦詩，自嘆時運不濟。</p>
<p>踢人屁股者大都亦願人踢其屁股、只要他認爲對方有踢人家屁股的身分與福氣。衙役，卑隸，司閽，馬弁，政客，官僚等皆同時進行踢屁股及獻尼股。</p>
<p>在君君，臣臣，父父，子子的國家，天下有道，則皇帝踢皇后的屁股，皇后踢宧官的屁股，宧官踢大臣的屁股，大臣踢疆吏的屁股，疆吏踢太守的屁股，太守踢庶人的屁股。假定自天子以至於庶人皆守已安分，循道不踰，一面被踢，一而踢人家，則分定位安身修家齊而國治天下平。天下無道，則宧官被皇帝踢屁股而哭訴於皇后之前，皇后反而踢天子屁股，於是上行下效，庶人踢太守屁股，太守踢疆吏屁股……是謂人心不古，天下大亂，百姓造反，而有革命黨出現。</p>
<p>少年人好打倒人家，反踢踢之者之屁股。老成人則反是·有涵養。因爲經騐，閱歷，世故告訴他，反踢者逆天，常要頭破血流，至少亦須常坐冷板凳，甘受踢者順天，順天則宧襄飽滿，陞官進爵，命中有軟墊沙發可坐。</p>
<p>文人政客失意時，每代屁股被踢之小百姓抱不平，主張屁股不應被踢，以合民治精神；得意時，又主張凡屁股皆有應踢之義，以符治安之旨。</p>
<p>讀書人踢百姓之屁股，而武人又從而踢讀書人之屁股。文人政客上臺後，主張凡屁股非自我踢之不可，爲公爲私，皆不得不犧牲個人，爲國效勞。不久，武人將他踢下來，亦恭頌曰：「這」脚踢得好啊！一然而不久，又主張，凡踢屁股是違反民治精神。</p>
<p>由被動的踢升爲主動的踢，其中有一層工夫，呌做「摸。」然凡摸趙孟之屁股者，趙孟卽有踢其屁股之權利。</p>
<p>同時好踢屁股，又以被踢時喊痛與不喊痛爲分。被踢而不喊痛者謂之「有涵養」，好喊痛者謂之「不識抬舉。」在中國屁股怕踢，或一踢便喊痛，還能算做屁股嗎？</p>
<p>斯巴達兒童亦有打屁股不許喊痛之練習。但情形又與中國不同。斯巴達人是練習不喊痛，不是練習給敵人踢屁股，而且同時練習反踢。因爲斯巴達人驍勇善戰，亦善踢雅典人之屁股踢屁股哲學已深入吾國人心理，要把他革除，以一百年爲限。</p>

<p>明代文人嗜曲，雖理學純儒亦有同嗜。王守仁固偶然一作散曲，丘濬則竟盡力傳奇，所作有五倫全備，投筆記，舉鼎記，羅囊記四種。或以理學大儒，不宜留心戲曲規之，彼則視之如仇。一日，彼過一寺，見壁畫丁廂故事，不覺詫異。因問一僧，空門安得有此？僧對曰，老僧於此悟禪。理學家假戲曲說敎，老和尚從西廂悟禪，此誠至堪發嘘者也。焦循劇說云「相傳明弘治末，泉州府學敎授某，南海人，頗立崖岸。一日，設宴明倫堂，搬演西廂雜劇。翌日，有無名子書一聯於學門云，斯文不幸，明倫堂上除來南海先生；學校無光，敎授館中搬出西廂雜劇。某出見之，赧然，故態頓去。」豈僅理學家如此？即文以載道之古文　亦嗜西廂。同書又云：「唐荆川半醉作文，先高唱西廂惠明不念法華經一齣，手舞足蹈，縱筆伸紙，文乃成。見操觚十六觀」。自命爲聖人之徒者尚如此，其他文人嗜曲，或僅觀賞，或竟創作，因無怪其然也。明政苛暴，忌諱孔多，隱於戲曲，是亦文人避禍之一法歟？而戲曲一道，明代爲盛矣。吕天成曲品序云，「予舞象時即嗜曲，弱冠好塡詞。每入市見傳奇，必挾之歸，笥漸滿。初欲建一曲藏，上自前輩才人之結撰，下至腐儒敎習之攢簇，悉搜共貯，作江海大觀。旣而謂多不勝收，彼攢簇者收之污吾篋，稍稍散失矣」。惜乎明人竟無肯爲曲藏者，不然，今人吳梅鄭振鐸諸人，不必瘁其心力於旁搜佚曲之一途矣，誇多鬥博胡爲哉？</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>在一種意想不到的機會中，我認得了三個劈拌子的人。</p>
<p>本來在哈爾濱的街上，像他們那樣的人，是有着很多的數目的。總是三四個人在一塊，背着斧子，鋸，兜生意，給人家劈着木頭拌子。</p>
<p>天天在街上走着，只有隂雨天怕是他們的休息日。</p>
<p>我認識的三個人，都是山東人，其實也只有他們山東人，才作得了這樣笨重活計，憑别人怎樣呌他們苦力一，我尊他們爲「社會的柱石」</p>
<p>以後，每天在相同的時間，我就看到他們三個人，以疏散的步子，背着斧子，鋸，出現在我住居着的街頭。彼此打着招呼，彼此全有着一種說不出的愉快。我看他們有些與人不同的地方，但又說不出口，惟其如此，更引起我對他們的關心，親切。</p>
<p>我們變　了熟朋友，我們談些只有在熟友中才能談到的話。他們知道我是一個從南方回到北邊的年青學生，他們雖說還不能知道我是幹什麽的，却因此爲我擔心，他們以十二分的至誠，忠告我對外人說話時，務要萬分的謹愼，因爲市裡的密探，正有地而上的螞蟻那般多。同時，他們又忠實地誠懇地把他們的過去告訴了我，使我知道一年前他們原是下江富錦一帶的農民，家裏都有着好多的人的，後來他們就投進幫，幹起義勇軍來，後來他們被打散了，然而他們是不輕易忘記那次散失的，那是他們二千多人和日本兵最猛烈的一次血戰，當眞日本兵在他們的刀鋒下死了二百多人。後來江裡發了大水，水災後没有飯吃，没有屋住，没有地種，就來到這都市求生活。</p>
<p>那時，我就那樣地問：</p>
<p>「你們不好再幹麽？」</p>
<p>他們不回答我，只看着我笑，我知道這裡面别有隱情，就把話頭引到别的地方。</p>
<p>在哈爾濱的街上，特别是南崗同馬家溝地方，有些街，常是從各方延展過來，交义在一處的，然　又分别着　　到　　的地方去，　　那交义處，就必然的會有一個小型的花園、裡面　着些古梅，樹蔭放些凳子。每天正午，耐不住酷熱的橙龔，我就拿着一把紙扇，到那種地方去避暑。坐在凳子上，接受從各個街口吹過來的凉風；聽小鳥在樹梢頭歌唱；街上懶懶的馬蹄聲和大汽車轟隆轟隆聲，使我在喧囂中遠能求到濟閑沈靜，過一會，不知不覺地就把身子躺在凳子上睡過去了。</p>
<p>那一天，以同一時間我又到那樹蔭下去避暑，坐下後，忽然想起來有好幾天没有看到三個熟朋友了，但一下就那麽想起來：也許他們到「道裡」「道外」，或是馬家溝那些地方兜生意去了。</p>
<p>可是，我到底想錯了，有一天傍晚，當我剛走卜電車，我看到面前走着一羣爲警察監視的犯人，帶着手銬，看那樣只是一些苦力們，究竟他們能犯着什麽罪呢？可是，忽然間，我看到人羣中有他們三個！幾天不見，你們就作了犯法的事？我想。</p>
<p>從路旁看熱閙人們的談論中，知道他們全是補捕獲的「危害新國」的罪犯，他們是義勇軍的便衣隊，打算要在市裡暴動的。本來這類不負責任的話，可以不理會的，但這一會子，我覺得是差不多少的，因爲我記起了三個朋友與人不同的地方，和他們在那一次不答我的問話，而單單笑着看我的往事。這自然是一件嚴重的問題，可是我願他們早日恢復了自由。</p>
<p>他們也看到我，那種伏滿在臉上的歡笑，怕只有眞正抗日而又不怕死的戰士才能有罷。</p>
<p>我陪他們笑了一笑，一個比黃蓮還苦的苦笑</p>

<p>（一）碎石子的投機</p>
<p>在市鎭裏有一條碎石子的路。一輛過路的車　出了一個召子。這個碎石就封着自已說：「爲什麽我要緊緊地擠在許多同類中停在這裏呢？我願意單獨地生活着。」</p>
<p>一個兒童走過來，拾起了這顆碎石子。</p>
<p>碎石心裏想：「我想要旅行，我就旅行。只要我能有堅强的充份的願望。」</p>
<p>那個兒童抛向一所房院去。碎石又想：「我想要飛，我就飛。這是很簡單的丨丨只要我這麽希望着。」</p>
<p>梆地一聲碎石穿過了玻璃窗。玻璃碎了，這樣玻璃呌起來；</p>
<p>「啊，你這個惡東西！你作的是什麽事呀？」</p>
<p>但是碎石回答道：</p>
<p>「你如果預先讓開了路，那就不會有這樣的事了。我不願意旁人擋住我的去路。一切的事都要爲我的利益而按排的丨丨這是我的標語。」</p>
<p>碎石落在一張軟軟的床上，於是想：「我飛了一陣了，現在我要休息一會兒。」</p>
<p>一個僕人走來，從床上檢起碎石，又從窗口把它抛出去，所以它又躺在碎石的路上。</p>
<p>於是碎石對着它的同類呌道：「弟兄們，你們好啊，我剛剛訪問過一家邸宅，但是我一點都不歡喜貴族，我的心是竭望着大衆，所以我又回來了。」</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>麽，這年青的，自由的，有錢的，準備獻身於一切温柔的瑪賴沙，有天偶然走進了一家小店，也許注意到了那漂亮的店主婦。他買了一點東西·他以後又再來·他和他們攀談起來，一天一天的熟悉了，他常常來買點東西，以便有權在這人家坐坐，和那少婦笑笑，和她的丈夫握握手。</p>
<p>而以後呢…以後呢…啊！天啊…以後呢？…</p>
<p>他曾愛過並撫弄過第一個孩子，那首飾商的孩子，等到另一個孩子出生後，他便把他的秘密緘默到死，隨後他的墓土已封，他的肉身已腐，他的名字再没有人提及，他這人便永久消失了，他什麽都不必顧慮，不必害怕，不必隱藏，他便把他所有的財産留給了第二個小孩！……爲什麽緣故呢？……這是個聰明人……他該懂得並該料到他會差不多必然地使人推測這孩子是他養的。丨丨那麽他不是毁壞了一個女人的名譽嗎？如果哲安不是他的兒子，他怎會做出這樣的事呢？</p>
<p>突然一個明確的，可怖的記憶，浮上了筆爾的腦中。瑪賴沙是有着金黃的頭髮的，和哲安一樣有着金黃的頭髮的。他這時記起從請住在巴黎時見到的，放在客廳孹爐上的一個小小的畫像，這畫像現在已不見了。它弄到什麽地方去了呢？失了呢，還是被隱藏了呢？啊！他祇要能夠把它拿在手囊一秒鐘就好了！他的母親也許把它藏在一個無人知道的，那種專放愛情的遺物的抽斗囊罷。</p>
<p>他想到這上面，他煩悶到了極點，不覺吐出了一聲吁嗟，那被激烈的痛楚逼出來的短促的歎息。突然，堤岸上的汽笛，好像聽到了他的歎息，好像了解他的歎息並給以回答似的，在他的身邊怒號起來。這種比雷還　的超自然的怪物的喧呼，這種能夠壓住風聲和壽聲的吼鳴，散布在被霧罩着的，不能見到的海的闇黑中。</p>
<p>於是相類的聲音，透過了霧氣，或遠或近，又從黑暗中揚起。這些由盲目的大郵船發出來的呌聲聽來足可怕的。</p>
<p>隨後又什麽都不響了。</p>
<p>筆爾張開眼睛瞧着，驚異自已會在那地方，他從惡夢中醒來了。</p>
<p>「我瘋了，我懷疑着我的母親。」他這樣悲。於是他心裏充滿着孝，感動，懊悔，祈求，和哀痛之忱。他的母親！他現在和過去一樣了解她，他怎能疑她呢？難道這位樸質，貞潔，正直的女人的靈魂和生活，不是比水還清嗎？凡是看見和認識她的人，誰能不忖度她是無可懷疑的呢？而現在却是他，她的兒子，在疑着她啊！如果這時他能夠把她攫在懷裏的話，他全會怎樣的抱吻她，撫慰她，怎樣的的跪在她面前求她饒恕啊！</p>

<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>上海爲今日全世界最大的國際商塲之一，外國語的應用自較全中國其他任何地方爲迫切而需要，外國語中則又以英文爲最時髦，所以習英語者亦較學其他外國語爲特多，自屬一種必然的現象。但是英語的需要雖切，學習英語時所必經的困難與時間却不能因此而减少，這是初學英語者，尤其是成年後始能有機會學英語的人所最感困難的一件事。好了！忽然聽見有一種基本英語的發明，牠祗要習會八百五十字，就可以應付普通會話，這是一班曾要學英語而又没有很多時間與金錢來化費的朋友們，應如何高興的一件事。誰知這種過份的奢望，不久又大失所望了，因爲基本英語的字數究竟太少了，普通小學生的會話都難於應付，用以應付複雜的商塲問答，自然更將笑話百出，不成其爲言語，同時一班英語說得好的先生們，又大施攻擊，譏諷努駡，無所不用其極，結果遂使多少要急切學英語的人空歡喜一塲，而提倡者亦不免要爲之灰心。本刊因爲接到討論這個問題的稿件很多，讀者來信要求解答這個問題的也不少，以前本刊雖批露過幾篇，但存稿尚多，於是遂决定出這一期的專號。但我們的態度是無所偏倚的，只是將所有來稿，無成見的盡量予以發表，望讀者能了解之。</p>
<p>在這一期專號的文字中無疑的攻擊的議論是佔着絶對的多數，記者已聲明在先不願作左右袒，所以也不要來參加什麽意見但是深覺有一點是我們對基本英語所應認識，就是英語在今日全世界的外國語中，究不失爲一種最普遍的適用語言。我們且撇開基本英語的民族性不談，只說基本英語發明者的目的，我想至少有一部分是在减少學習英語的困難，利用英語現有的地位，更普遍的應用，這種動機是我們所宜了解的。因爲學一種語言，必須要時有實習的機會，方不易忘記，英語至少在這一點上是佔着優勝的地位，而基本英語，亦不外乎是根據這一點而産生。說句公道話，基本英語的最大缺點是字太少，若是發明者能根據事實，重新的放以增補，則牠的前途固仍未可限量的。我們希望讀者也不要因爲批評者的苛刻，就完全抹殺了牠的價值，要知道一件新東西出來，嚴厲的批評總是不可避免的。但是牠的最後勝利這全要看發明者與同情牠的人能不能虚心的接受批評，審度批評的意見而加以改進，這是創造一件新事業的一般原則，我們對於基本英語的前途亦當以此來做推測的根據</p>
<p>最後記者還有一點要向基本英語發明者建議的，就是我深　基本英語的字數就是變成「一千八百五十字」也還是很容易學習的，仍可以稱之爲基本英語，那麽，我想笑　　者比「八百五十字」要减少得多了。</p>
<h3 id="c266">泛論基本英語的構造 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 石安</p>
<p>基本英語究竟是什麽樣的東西呢？這是我現在所要和本刊讀者諸君共同研究的。</p>
<p>第一，基本英語並不是像有些人所說，輕易在幾個月以内就學得好的。牠的缺點和標凖英語一模一樣。例如麻煩的拚音，動詞不規則的變化，不合理的成語，這都是從標凖英語裏面，原舖原蓋地搬過來的。這幾點，在標凖英語裏面是使學者最感困難的地方，說是在基本英語中會忽然容易起來，這分明是不可能的。</p>
<p>第二，基本英語通身充滿着怪誕，笨拙，一點也不合於言語的規律。牠的内容有一部分和標準英語完全不同，是奥格登等人他們所誇耀之處、是基本英語的特色，但也就是牠最艱難最欠缺的地方。這就是把我們日常生活中所必需的許多字都不要，僅僅留下八白五十個字，來包辦幾千字的職能。人類最基本最普通的動作，每天從起床到睡覺也不止有好幾十種，但基本英語的動詞却只有十八個。所以，你跑時不能說「跑」（Ｒun），只能說是「走快」（ＧoQoickly）；要剃鬍子，只能說「拿去臉上的毛」。這種說法，充分暴露了表現法的貧乏。試想想，學了基本英語，使你連跑跟走都不會區别，剃鬍子也剃不清楚，要你和别人辦交涉，你還會弄得妥當嗎？要你用基本英語來發表思想，你有把握不被人家誤會嗎？</p>
<p>人類的生活内容，與人與人之間的交互關係，是適應於社會生産力的發展，一天比一天豐富，一天比一天複雜的。我們的活動範圍旣　太　用來　表思想的語言也隨着豐富起來，以滿足實際的需要。基本英語只替我們留下十八個動詞，這是使語言由豐富而退於貧乏，分明是違反了語言的進化律，使語言大開倒車的勾當。</p>
<p>再說名詞，那更是又艱記又笨拙。語言本是人類傳達思想的工具，所以牠最基本的條件是要說出來人家就懂得。如果只有自已懂得，那就不成其爲人話。在基本英語裏面，就有大多數的話是非常費解，只有自已能夠懂的。譬如標準英語說葱是Ｏnion，原是非常簡單，明瞭，而基本英語偏偏不要，硬要用「令眼出水的白根」來代替。這種轉灣抹角的話，英國人自已也不高興（請參考每日國際文選英國人的基本英語批評）</p>
<h3 id="c267">本刊啓事 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>自本刊前幾期發表幾篇關於基本英語及世界語研究的文章後，近來接到同樣性質的稿件多起，而其他性質的稿件則甚缺乏，因此，除已於本期出「基本英語研究專號」外，擬於下期出「世界語研究專號」，特此預告。</p>
<p>，學普通英語的中國人也是非常「痛恨」的（見林語堂先生的文章），因爲一來非常難記，二來容易誤會。葱固然是「令眼出水的白根」，我們鄕間常見的「辣菜」也是道地的「白根」，也能夠「令眼出水」。像這一類天曉得的怪話，根本就没有做語言的資格。</p>
<p>轉灣抹角的說話，本是變化程度很低的人和小防的拿手好戲。内地的鄕間人第一次看見汽車，說是「四隻圓脚嗚嗚飛跑的東西」：小孩子不懂得眼鏡，說　「眼睛上的圈　」。所以基本英語並不是奥格登的新發明，只是拜小孩子和文化水凖很低的人做老師，摹仿他們表</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>現思想的方法而已。但是，内地鄕間人多看見兩次「四隻圓脚嗚嗚飛跑的東西」，他漸漸知道用「汽車」去呌它了，小孩子一經阿爸或阿媽告訴，也就會把一眼睛上的圈圈」呌作「眼鏡」。而我們中國的學者，編輯，却還在大開倒車，把野蠻的表現法居爲奇貨，算它是二十世紀的新發明，這豈不是一個笑話嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c268">談談基本英語文法的特點 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 秦世蔭</p>
<p>基本英語的文法，據「入門」一三○頁說，有兩點特點，即：（一）其他國語（連普通英語）都是連篇累牘的動詞變化表。這種變化，非數年不能學好。而基本英語只要記熟一張動詞變化表。（二）就是最被人贊助的一種世界語，關係各字的語尾變化，至少也有五百個規則。基本英語則不然。但我們如果知道了「世界語」Ｅsperanto的總文規一共只有十六條，其中只有第六條是講到動詞的變化的，較之基本英語的動詞變化表還要合理而簡覃。</p>
<p>被中國基本英語的提倡者，驚嘆爲最巧妙的特色的複合名詞和接頭語，接尾語，實際也是淺薄，貧乏得可憐的。</p>
<p>所謂複合名詞或由兩名詞複合而成，或由一名詞與一方向的名詞複合而成，總以標凖英語内所有者爲限（見「文法」三一頁），這樣，便被局限於六百個名詞和二十個方向的名詞（前置詞）以内了。雖然例外地有些他類單字也可兩個兩個地連合成一新字，但其意義完全是新的，不能一望而知的。（見「入門」一○二頁）世界語則凡單字可互相結合而成新字，只要合於邏輯，稱爲結合語。</p>
<p>至於接頭語，在基　　語中，五十個性質形容詞，大部分　以加un來表示「返對」的意義（見「文法」六五頁），基本英語的二十個前置詞也可以作爲凖接頭語，而加在十個簡單動詞前面，構成新的動詞（見「入門」七五頁）。但這是怎樣狹小的範圍啊，不但八百五十個字已經奪去了接頭語的活潑的生命，而且接頭語的數目根本就太少了。在世界語中，有九個接頭語，四十個準接頭語，一個特殊接頭語，五個學術上其他接頭語，使字彚不必笨拙地，反科學地，反進化地局限於八百五十字内而得到活潑的改良。如照世界語中表示「相反」的意義的接頭語是mal，則「入門」三六丨七頁的二十五對相對形容詞中，在世界語中就有一大部分是無須用形式完全不同的字了。</p>
<p>基本英語中僅有四個可以勉强稱得接尾語，即：er·or·ing·ed。其實這裏邊，or是er的例外，加ing可轉化爲名詞，也可轉化爲形容詞之用，和ed一樣只是文法上的詞類的語尾。但世界語的詞性的分類，都有語尾明明白白規定，不致如Ａbuilderisbuildingabuilding中兩個Ｂuilding樣的混溷，雖然在這種最簡單的句子中尚易辨别，世界語接尾語有二十九個，準接尾語有四個，特殊接尾語有六個，學術上的接尾語有十六個。這使世界語不必違反語言與社會進化向豐富的道路的原則，狂妄地限制單字的數量，而可以更巧妙地達到縮小字彚，使言語「簡易化」而且更重要地合理化了。</p>
<p>所以無論基本英語被一部分人說得怎樣動聽，總没有世界語的合理化和簡易化。我想，中國基本英語的提倡者，總應該相信，縮小字彚不是機械地减少數量和用「迂迴法」（其實是背字典的方法）所能做到的。</p>
<h3 id="c269">科學的言語丨基本英語 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 張國權</p>
<p>自然科學的發達，把空間縮小了。在國際交通上，我們有火車，輪船，甚至飛機。但是在人類精神的交通上，至今我們尚缺少一種工具。好了，現在已經有種國際語出現了，那就是英國劍橋大學的言語學專家奥格登敎授新發明的「基本英語」！</p>
<p>我們大家知道，英語差不多到處通行的，正和英國的國旗一樣，而尤其在東方中國等處。所以把英語採用作國際語，實在是頂妥當便利的辦法。可是，英語是非常難學的，所以要呌各國人都去學英語，也勢所不能。奥格登敎授就看到了這點，因此發願從事於英語的國際化簡易化的工作，費了十年的心血，才從標凖英語中選出八百五十個單字來。可見這是科學的結晶。</p>
<p>因爲基本英語只有八百五十個字，所以非常容易的，三個月就能成功。學成後就會話，作文，寫信，無所不能。如果再想進一步研究，也可由此再去研究標凖英語，所以又是學標準英語的捷徑。</p>
<p>這是種新發明的國際語，在理論上及内容上成尚有缺點，但是可以慢慢改進的。而且現在全世界已有三十餘種基本英語書箱，在中國也已出了六本了。我們可以想像，全世界學基本英語的人會慢慢多起來的。</p>
<p>基本英語的特點，就在能以很少的字數，來表現一切的話。但是，要在八百五十字中包涵一切必要的字，原是做不到的。所以在基本英語中，就用了十個字以内的字去解釋它。這就是它組織上最巧妙的地方。</p>
<p>現在的人，誰都感覺到國際語的需要。而這基本英語就是最好的國際語，就是你要學英語，也宜從基本英語入手。</p>
<h3 id="c270">論基本英語的實用 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 鄧立人</p>
<p>提倡基本英語者宣稱，基本英語的八百五十字，一可以寫出或說出一切日常必需的話」。但是用這區區的八百五十字，如何能表達日常生活的一切呢？於是不得不用編字典的辦法，來「解釋」這八百五十以外的字。但在編字典的人，目的原在於「解釋」字義，爲求字義的明確起見，用了幾十字甚至幾百字來「解釋」一個字，這原是應該的。基本英語旣然是種言語，則言語的目的自然是在於能暢達自已的意思，而又能爲人所正確理解。言語的目的决不在「解釋」，决不是編字典。但是基本英語强迫人們用編字典的口氣來說話，顯然是不對的。在寫文章的時侯，如遇到八百五十以外的字，奥格登敎我們可以用脚註，但是在說話的時候，如何用脚註呢？譬如我們用基本英語打電話的時候，遇到八百五十中所没有的字，能不能說：「對不住，等一等，讓我先來一條脚註吧！一而且每人都得隨身帶好一本袖珍本的「基本英語字典」，不論吃飯或大便，以便隨時翻閱他所要的脚註。否則無論何時都有碰璧的危險的。而且這本基本英語字典，據中國基本英語提倡者告訴我們，也只有七千五百字，換句話說，只有七千五百條「解釋」，那末，如果遇到七千五百以外的字（人生於世，誰都不免有這種時侯的），又怎麽「解釋」法呢？奥格登並無辦法指示給我們，大概一尚在研究」中吧。也罷，這條就放過不提。我們試來看看這種言語的實用吧。</p>
<p>如果有個學習基本英語的飯館裏的侍者，或是洋人家的西崽，他是遲早要給主人停歇生意的。因爲非但「葱」是「令人出水的白根」，就是「楊梅糕」，也得說「皮上有毛的青黃色的漿果上面蓋麵糊的」。「煎板魚」呌做「味道細膩的扁魚，用油在火上煑的」。「捲心菜」也非得說「有圓的心或頭的青色植物」不可。這種說法，非但難記，而且在小菜塲或食品店裏决無人懂得的。</p>
<p>如果那些學基本英語的人中，有個是看護婦，她的運命是和那個西崽相彷的。在和醫生出診去的時候，醫生要個「一種尖頭的有推拉器的管子，用空氣的壓力放水在它裏面，再放出來成一條很細的水線，以爲醫治用的」。這是打針用的「注射器」的意思，誰能記得一點不錯呢？而這位看護婦會不會給醫生攆出去，是我們可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>如果是個商店裏的學徒，那他所碰到的困難便更大了。非但連「電話」等等常用的字，在八百五十字内没有，須另行學習，而且遇見了主顧，連「先生」「女士」（八百五十字中所無）也不會說，只能直呼「那個男人」「那個女人」。</p>
<p>我們雖然不是預言家（照基本英語的口氣，應該說：「講未來事情的話的人」），但我們可以猜想，基本英語决經</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Decides to Send Large Army to Fortify Zhejiang Province's Border Defenses; Reportedly, Cai Tingkai Leads Troops Northward; Zhejiang's Border Military Strength Is Formidable; Naval Main Force Concentrated in Sanduao; Liu Heding's Troops Have Not Retreated from Zhejiang Border <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Fujian intelligence reports, Cai Tingkai is leading troops northward, intending to encroach upon Zhejiang's territory. The government, upon learning this, is deeply indignant. To protect the territory and ensure the people's safety, it has decided to send a large army into Zhejiang to fortify the border defenses. The Eighty-eighth Division, garrisoning the Beijing-Shanghai line, has already received orders to be ready to depart. Once a certain independent brigade arrives to take over the defense, they will set off. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: The Zhejiang border already has troops from Zhao Guantao, Zhou Hunyuan, and others, possessing considerable strength. Zhejiang military circles report that after the Fujian rebellion occurred, in order to quell the internal strife, the central government, in addition to increasing a large number of troops to effectively defend key passes where Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces border Fujian, also ordered the navy to prepare everything. Currently, the Yat Sen and five other ships have departed. Ships like the Ninghai, Haichou, and Hairong, etc., have been ordered to concentrate in the Shanghai area. Chen Shaokuan will personally lead the fleet to depart. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government telegraphed various locations in Beijing and Shanghai, ordering strict precautions against the Third Party and the Social Democratic Party taking advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble. (Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important official from the aviation administration who came to Beijing from Hangzhou stated that after the Fujian rebellion, in order to understand the military actions of that province, the aviation administration has been dispatching three reconnaissance planes daily to reconnoiter the Xianxia Pass and other places on the Zhejiang-Fujian border. According to reports, the rebel army on the Fujian border has not yet engaged in any harassing military actions. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Naval news: The main naval force is currently concentrated in Sanduao. The Jiangyuan and Jiangzhen ships, formerly stationed in the Min River, as well as a large portion of the marine corps, are all awaiting instructions there. Li Mengbin, the commander of the Mawei key port, is also currently there directing everything and is very busy. Although various newspapers reported on the 25th that Li had arrived in Shanghai, the navy has not yet received any such news to date. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sources say that the Longhai, Jinpu, and Pinghan Railways have been very busy with military transport in recent days. The various troops originally stationed along the lines have been ordered to move toward the Yangtze River area. The defense of Xuzhou will be taken over by Chen Tiaoyuan's troops, and Xuchang will be taken over by Pang Bingxun. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Lu Dipeng: Liu Heding's troops are still stationed in their original defensive positions in northern Fujian. There is no news of them withdrawing to the Zhejiang border. The Zhejiang border is peaceful as usual. Our province has deployed a tight defense. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) The new government's foreign affairs department began working today. The Pacification Headquarters was renamed the First Front Army Headquarters today. Central government banknotes are now circulating freely in the city. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military staff officer of the Nineteenth Route Army who withdrew from Fujian to Beijing stated that the Nineteenth Route Army had exhausted its elite troops in the battles against the Japanese in Shanghai and the campaign against the Communists in northern Fujian. Although it was later replenished by reorganizing the militia and pacifying bandits, it was nominally made up of six divisions, but its combat effectiveness was far inferior to before. Since the unveiling of the rebellious government, the central government and Guangdong Province have both stopped paying the 900,000 yuan in subsidies, so they must seek a way out externally. When I was in the army, I saw in their important military meetings some advocated sending troops to Zhejiang, saying that Jiangsu and Zhejiang were where the central government was located, and if Zhejiang was obtained, it would be enough to shake the central government. Some advocated first seizing Chaozhou and Meizhou in Guangdong, because the various counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou had no defensible terrain and were easier to capture. Furthermore, because Chaozhou and Meizhou were rich areas, obtaining them could serve as a base for military supplies, and the officers and soldiers in the army were mostly from Guangdong, so their desire to return to Guangdong was extremely strong. Others advocated maintaining a heavy military presence and waiting for responses from various places. As a result, most of them said that Fujian's land was barren and the people were poor, so it was better to quickly seek a way out, entering Guangdong by an indirect route to first seize Chaozhou and Meizhou.

(2) If it withholds salt taxes and post office deposits without international interference, it will be treated as a domestic matter and not interfered with.

<h3 id="e18">Current Commentary: The Issue of Reorganizing the South Manchuria Railway <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the tendency of the Japanese military to dictate policy has become more and more concrete. The Saito cabinet, ostensibly based on meritocracy and national unity, is actually entirely dominated by the military. In everything from domestic and foreign policy, although contradictions often arise between political parties, financial groups, and the military, the result is always a compromise to the military's wishes.</p>
<p>The Japanese military's dictatorial arrogance is most thoroughly displayed in its policy of aggression toward China. In the past, all Japanese military actions in China were carried out freely by the Japanese military. After the establishment of the "Manchukuo puppet state," Mutō, so-called "Three in One", concurrently held the positions of Commander of the Kwantung Army, Director of the Kwantung Leased Territory, and Japanese Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Manchukuo. This meant that one warlord monopolized Manchuria's military, administrative, and diplomatic affairs.</p>
<p>Now, the Japanese warlords' clutches have extended further to the economic structure of Japanese interests in Manchuria. The South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan recently proposed by the Japanese Kwantung Army aims to realize this new ambition.</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway Company is a disguised East India Company by which Japan intends to annex Manchuria. Its capital has reached 800 million yuan. The staff of the executive agencies are appointed and dismissed by the Japanese government. It is no longer a purely commercial organization, but a state-run enterprise that forms the basis of Japan's economic aggression against Manchuria. Under its control, in addition to railway enterprises, there are mining, general industry, shipping, and electrical and aviation industries. Virtually all important enterprises in Manchuria have the South Manchuria Railway's influence infiltrating them. In reality, it has formed the main body of the so-called "Japan-Manchukuo controlled economy." Because of the South Manchuria Railway's importance, it will inevitably fall under the clutches of the military, which monopolizes everything.</p>
<p>The content of the "South Manchuria Railway Reorganization Plan" proposed by the Kwantung Command, summarizing general news, is nothing more than the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) All operations in Manchuria will be under the jurisdiction of the Kwantung Army and will have nothing to do with the Colonial Affairs Ministry.</p>
<p>(2) The members of the guidance agencies should be assumed by some of the current special service department members of the Kwantung Army and members of the South Manchuria Railway's economic investigation committee.</p>
<p>(3) The various enterprises operated by the South Manchuria Railway must be independent according to the principle of "one country, one industry" and in accordance with business training. The South Manchuria Railway itself will be reorganized into a special company specializing in raising funds and fostering new companies.</p>
<p>(4) The implementation date is set for after April of next year, but all legal procedures must be completed in this winter's parliament. Since the military proposed reorganizing the South Manchuria Railway, political circles, financial circles, and shareholders and employees of the South Manchuria Railway have expressed opposition within Japan. In particular, the Colonial Affairs Ministry and South Manchuria Railway employees have opposed it particularly fiercely. The former is mainly due to the transfer of jurisdictional authority, and the latter is due to the threat to their livelihoods after the reorganization. The dispute is gradually expanding. However, the outcome is likely to be the same as the contradictions in the current military budget. The final victory still belongs to the military.</p>
<p>So what is the military's motive for proposing to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway?</p>
<p>Although the Japanese government's shareholding in the South Manchuria Railway is considerable, private individuals also own more than half. Why should the guidance members belong to the Kwantung Army's economic staff headquarters? Also, among the various enterprises operated by the South Manchuria Railway, only the railway enterprise is the most profitable. Other businesses, such as mining, commerce, and local operations, are all suffering huge losses. If they are operated independently, it will certainly cause great losses to some shareholders. Management will also suffer a fatal blow. The military has not failed to see this point. But why do they want to make it decompose? Needless to say, this is extremely related to the recent deterioration of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and the future Japan-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Once a Japan-Soviet war breaks out, Manchuria will, of course, bear the brunt. It is not only in a strategic area, but also a supplier of war resources. The various enterprises currently under the control of the South Manchuria Railway will play a major role in future wars. In order for the military to freely take war resources, how can it still care about the South Manchuria Railway's own operating profits? It only feels the need to hold them in its hands. And it must be eager to implement this claim.</p>

(Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Fujian rebellion, all parties have been closely watching its military actions. Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others cannot forget Guangdong Province; this is an established fact. According to reports, war is already imminent. Chen Jitang is preparing military deployments on the East River, believing that war is probably unavoidable. He has repeatedly telegraphed Beijing and Jiangxi, reporting the situation, and has stated that once the war begins, it will by no means be resolved in the short term. Regarding the burden of military supplies, Guangdong Province is really unable to support it alone. Yang Dezhao attended the central government meeting the other day. In addition to reporting on Guangdong Province's defenses, he requested that the government provide special assistance for military expenses during the war, in addition to paying the 1 million yuan in subsidies for November and December in advance. He requested that 2 million yuan in temporary expenses be allocated in the near future to meet urgent needs. The committee members present expressed that they should do their best to help. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi also promised to try his best to find a way, but because the military spending issue concerns the overall distribution, it should be fully discussed with Chairman Chiang. Among Yang's tasks in going to Jiangxi, the most urgent to be resolved is the above matter. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang's office said that the Fujian-Guangdong border is currently peaceful. As for any actions by Fujian to invade Guangdong, Guangdong will inflict a painful blow. Guangdong currently has three armies, six divisions, one training division, three independent divisions, and two independent brigades, which should not find it difficult to annihilate the Nineteenth Route Army on the Fujian side, provided that the central government can fully supply everything. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chinese-language newspapers carried news from Guangzhou saying that a certain military spokesman declared today that although Guangzhou does not approve of the independence movement in Fujian Province, it will not lightly resort to force unless it is forced to do so. The Guangzhou authorities have now decided to maintain security and order in the province and do not want to be involved in the war outside the province. However, the railway bureau has been ordered to prepare trains for the transportation of troops at any time, which proves that although Chen Jitang does not want to start a war with others, he does not want to be attacked without being able to cope.

<p>(Guangzhou) Xiao Focheng told a guest today that Guangzhou is currently considering the third step in dealing with the Fujian rebellion. Several leaders of the Southwest Political Council are now proposing that the Southwest should ask the Nineteenth Route Army to immediately cease military activities. This proposal is currently being discussed and a decision will be made within days. The Kwangsi Army's office in Guangdong denied reports from Hong Kong that Li Jishen had secretly arrived in Wuzhou to promote cooperation between Kwangsi and Fujian, and said that Li Bai now has the same attitude as the Guangdong authorities.

<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang gave a long speech at the opening ceremony of the Guangdong Provincial Economic Conference today, stating briefly that the most important thing in the three-year plan is economic recovery, so all economic problems must first seek a solution.

He ended by saying that there is no need to panic about the Fujian situation. Guangdong Province's position is extremely secure. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Central Propaganda Committee Issues Letter to the Nation's Compatriots and Comrades: "Upholding the Great and Firm Spirit of Our Premier Sun, We Struggle Unyieldingly Against Traitors" Another Letter Issued to Compatriots and Comrades in Fujian <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Committee yesterday released a letter addressed to the nation's compatriots and all comrades of the party regarding the Fujian Incident. The original text is as follows: "In recent years, the nation has faced many difficulties. Internally, the Red bandits rampage, and externally, powerful enemies encroach. The foundation of the nation is in grave danger, and we cannot continue in this state. The Central Government, carefully weighing the international situation and thoroughly examining the root causes of the national crisis, has, based on the principles of internal pacification and external resistance, comprehensively planned the suppression of bandits and the defense against foreign aggression. It is working with the people of the country to salvage the nation from danger. Now, with the bandit scourge not yet eradicated and the threat of foreign aggression intensifying, all citizens should ignite their conscience and unite in struggle to save us from peril. We must not entertain any illusions or have any ulterior motives. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others have at this moment launched a rebellion in the eight prefectures of Fujian, presumptuously establishing a false regime, colluding with bandits and aligning with the enemy, destroying the party and betraying the country. Their actions are outrageous and extremely hateful. According to newspaper reports, Chen, Li, and others have gathered reactionary elements from the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, the Third Party, and the Nationalist faction to form the so-called Production Party and the People's Revolutionary Government. They have abolished the name of the Republic of China and the national flag and party emblem created by our Premier, openly rebelling against the party and the country. In the past, even when there were disputes within the country, no one had dared to form a new party and betray the party and the country so brazenly. Chen, Li, and others, as members of the Central Committee of this party, or holding important positions in the government, should, at this time of national crisis and when the entire country is working together to suppress bandits, set an example and devote themselves to the party and the country. Instead, they have become erratic and act perversely, which is intolerable by party discipline and must be punished by national law. Moreover, the Red bandits have been wreaking havoc for years, poisoning the people, destroying society, selling out the nation, and endangering the country. Millions of people in various provinces have died from the bandit scourge, and more than ten million have been displaced and impoverished. Thanks to the support of the people of the country and the bravery of the soldiers suppressing the bandits, we have been making steady progress and gradually clearing them out. Yet Chen, Li, and others have, at this critical juncture for the success or failure of bandit suppression and the survival of the nation, advocated aligning with the communists and enabling the bandits. They have concluded a non-aggression pact with the Communist Party, supplying them with military equipment and provisions, destroying and undermining the bandit suppression front formed by the cooperation of the people and the government over the years, as well as the achievements gained through political and military efforts. They are releasing and aiding the bandits, the root of the scourge that has caused the entire country to suffer, and endangering the survival of the nation and the people. They intend to make Fujian a second Jiangxi, plunging the nation and the people into an abyss from which they can never recover. Only those who have lost all conscience could bear to do this. Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the country have been alarmed by the intensifying threat of foreign aggression and the precarious state of the nation. They have wholeheartedly committed themselves to overcoming the national crisis, adhering to the principle of internal pacification and external resistance, and preparing to recover lost territories and avenge humiliation. Their dedication is shared by the entire nation. Only those who betray their country and serve the enemy would degrade themselves and work for the enemy. Now, Chen, Li, and others are gathering traitors to serve as guides for aligning with the enemy, such as Chen Youren, who personally visited Shidehara to sell out the Northeast, and Han Binli, a strong supporter of the Anfu clique who advocated for Nishihara Loans. They are either heading the puppet government's foreign affairs or colluding with Japanese financial groups in Japan. Their acts of treason are clear for all to see. If the lives of Chen and Li and other rebels are prolonged and their conspiracy to sell out the country succeeds, not only will Fujian become another Northeast, endangering the nation's survival, but also the glory of the nation's soldiers who fought bravely in Shanghai and shed blood at the Great Wall will be tarnished and become a lasting shame for the Chinese nation that cannot be erased. In summary, the rebellious acts of Chen and Li are moths in the party, traitors to the country, public enemies of the people, and criminals against the nation. Their crimes are worse than those of traitors and their harm is greater than that of the Red bandits. In addition to permanently expelling Chen and others from the party and handing them over to the government for strict investigation, our compatriots across the country must understand the difficulties and dangers, distinguish between obedience and rebellion, and unleash the power of the people to impose severe sanctions on them. In particular, our comrades across the country must deeply recognize that the actions of Chen, Li, and others in destroying the party and harming the nation are a great crisis for our party and a humiliation for all comrades. We must unite sincerely, support the Central Government, lead the people, and punish betrayal. Upholding the great and firm spirit of our Premier Sun, we must struggle unyieldingly against traitors so that the evil atmosphere can be swept away, the sun and moon can shine again, and the future of the party and the country can be secured. Our comrades and compatriots, let us rise up and strive for this!" (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Committee issued a letter to the compatriots and comrades in Fujian on the 25th. The original text is as follows: "This time, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others have colluded with reactionaries, launched a rebellion in Fujian, colluded with bandits and aligned with the enemy, destroyed the party and betrayed the country, disrupted the major plans for suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression, and endangered the survival of the nation and the people. When news of this rebellion arrived, the entire country was filled with anger, denouncing them and demanding their punishment. The righteousness of this cause is clear. Our compatriots and comrades in Fujian, witnessing Chen and Li's perverse actions and suffering from the oppression and trampling of the rebels, will surely act swiftly and righteously without delay. Fujian has always been an important revolutionary base and has a glorious history in our party. Since the founding of our party, many people from Fujian have participated in the revolution and struggled arduously. In particular, in the Guangzhou Uprising in March of the Xinhai year, the martyrs from Fujian sacrificed themselves in large numbers and with great courage, shaking the world and shining for eternity. The monument erected at Huanghuagang stands as proof. During the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Eastern Route Army's flank marched into Fujian, tracing the Min River, crossing Xianxia, recapturing Zhejiang and Shanghai, and stabilizing the Southeast. This rapid progress was largely due to the assistance of the people of Fujian. Moreover, since the Tongmenghui, overseas Chinese from Fujian have contributed their family wealth to the party's military needs. Their assistance to the revolutionary cause has been particularly significant. All of this is admirable and worthy of respect, and it is something that the people of Fujian can be proud of. Now, Chen, Li, and others have suddenly, at a time when we are suppressing bandits, resisting foreign aggression, pacifying the country, and resisting external threats, openly declared the destruction of the party and the betrayal of the country. They have implemented cooperation with the communists, welcomed the representatives of bandit leaders to Fuzhou, and supplied the remnants of bandits with military equipment and medicine. Furthermore, they have recruited traitors such as Chen Youren and Han Binli, colluding with Japanese financial groups to beg for their assistance. The flames of the nearly extinguished Red bandits have been rekindled, and the enemy's ambition to invade has been revived. They are determined to make the disaster in southern Fujian even more profound and the loss of the Northeast insufficient. They are determined to turn the entire Fujian into a second Jiangxi and the Southeast into a continuation of the Northeast before they can be satisfied and their wishes fulfilled. Their actions are so outrageous and insane. Our compatriots and comrades in Fujian must not allow this important base of the Chinese revolution to be reduced to a source of destruction for the party and harm to the nation. They must punish and bring justice to Chen, Li, and others for their rebellious acts. Furthermore, Fujian is inherently impoverished and has long been a province requiring financial assistance. Moreover, banditry and natural disasters have followed one after another, leaving the people's livelihood in dire straits beyond description. However, at the beginning of their rebellion, Chen, Li, and others immediately began recruiting bandits and expanding their military strength. All supplies are requisitioned locally. How can the people bear this after suffering from disasters? According to newspaper reports, these rebels have cleverly established various tax categories and are willing to drain the pond to catch all the fish. If they are allowed to survive and are not restrained, then the people of Fujian who have not died from natural disasters and banditry will also die from exploitation and extortion. Our compatriots and comrades in Fujian, for the sake of saving the party and the country, and for the sake of saving ourselves and others, should unite and swiftly sweep away the evil atmosphere. The Central Government is determined to quell the rebellion. It is only out of concern for the compatriots in Fujian and for the anti-Japanese troops that we do not want to mobilize the masses and launch a military campaign immediately. We hope to resolve this major crisis through political measures. Our compatriots and comrades in Fujian must recall the glory of their revolutionary history, understand the difficulties of the nation, distinguish between right and wrong, and follow the spirit of our Premier Sun in unyielding struggle, uniting to save the province and the country. Then the bandits can be suppressed, and the future of the party and the nation can be secured. It is upon this that we rely." (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Issues Notice to Overseas Chinese Regarding the Fujian Incident <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission held a regular meeting on the morning of the 25th and passed a letter to overseas Chinese, and appointed Chen Chunpu and others to be responsible for revising the regulations on encouraging overseas Chinese to return to the country to start businesses and other important cases. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, considering that Chen Mingshu and others have organized a reactionary government in Fujian, destroying the party and misleading the country, and their crimes are heinous, has specially notified overseas Chinese about the changes in the Fujian situation. The original text is recorded as follows: "Regarding the notice: Since the outbreak of the national crisis, the entire country, from top to bottom, has been alarmed by the increasing foreign aggression and knows that without sincere unity, there is no way to save the nation from danger. Furthermore, with the people's strength declining, we know that without revitalizing the rural areas and striving for economic construction, there is no way to strengthen the people's livelihood and consolidate the foundation of the nation. Therefore, we have proclaimed to the people of the country the principle of pacifying the interior before resisting external aggression. On the one hand, we are launching a large-scale offensive against the Communist bandits who are destroying rural areas and shaking the national organization, in order to remove obstacles to construction and alleviate internal concerns. In recent months, the military operations to suppress the bandits have been winning victories, and it was said that the future of the country has revealed a chance of recovery. Unexpectedly, Chen Mingshu and his like have at this time gathered corrupt elements such as the so-called Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, the Nationalist faction, the Communist Party, and former warlords to plot a rebellion in Fujian and organize the so-called Revolutionary Government of the Chinese National Alliance. They are willing to bury the glorious history of the 19th Route Army's past resistance against Japan and suppression of communists, and dig their own graves. It is extremely painful to speak of this. Their using their troops to pursue their selfish ends is especially regrettable for the generals and soldiers of the 19th Route Army. Chen Mingshu and others have openly betrayed the party and the country, declared their withdrawal from the Kuomintang, abolished the Blue Sky White Sun flag, and shouted slogans of 'Down with the Chinese Kuomintang.' Their actions are childish and ridiculous. Chen and others were still members of the Kuomintang Central Committee before the rebellion. When they served in the Central Government, they invariably vowed to follow the Three Principles of the People and obey party discipline. Yet within a few months, they have acted so perversely. Therefore, the purpose of this rebellion is self-evident and needs no further explanation. Judging from the organization of the so-called Production Party, it already feels neither fish nor fowl, and its content is even more complex and bizarre. Knowing that the name 'Communist' is unacceptable to the people of the country, they changed the word 'Communist' to 'Production' as a disguise. Knowing that the political views of the Nationalist faction and former warlords are contradictory and conflicting with those of the Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, and the Communist Party, they collectively named it the Production Party as a compromise. However, in practice, they collude with communists and ally with the enemy, stopping at nothing. All of this has facts to prove it and is not mere conjecture. Speaking of colluding with the communists, they have already concluded a military agreement of non-aggression with the Communist bandits and stopped anti-communist propaganda. Furthermore, they are providing the bandits with food and supplying the bandit areas in Fujian with 300,000 yuan of salt, 300,000 yuan of medicines, and 100,000 yuan of military equipment and materials. Everything that the Communist bandits were lacking and almost dying from due to the Central Government's blockade and encirclement policy, Chen and others are supplying them with, allowing them to revive and cause harm to the Republic of China. Speaking of collaborating with the enemy, they have already sent Chen Youren to ask the enemy for understanding and request their spiritual and material assistance. Furthermore, they are following the old tricks of Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang in North China, using the name of resisting the enemy to actually serve the enemy. However, they still use the excuse of geographical relations as a pretext, saying that they have no choice but to do so. This is not only deceiving the generals and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, but also fooling the people of the country. To collude with communists and ally with the enemy is to abandon the position of the country and violate the interests of the nation. How can a regime that abandons the position of the country and violates the interests of the nation exist? Therefore, we dare to believe that it will inevitably fail, and the so-called Revolutionary Government of the Chinese National Alliance is just a flash in the pan. Looking back at the 19th Route Army during the Battle of Shanghai, our overseas Chinese admired their struggle for national survival and donated military funds amounting to no less than tens of millions of yuan. Later, they donated aircraft to supplement their military equipment, hoping that they would continue to implement their policy of defending the territory and protecting the country. Now, Chen Mingshu and others are using the military funds and aircraft donated by our overseas Chinese to rebel against the country. How can overseas Chinese not feel heartbroken and indignant when they hear about this? The Communist bandits originally had no aircraft, so even though they were extremely vicious in the bandit areas, they were still unable to achieve military progress. Now that Chen and others are joining forces with the Communist bandits, if the aircraft donated by our overseas Chinese are used to support the bandits, it is tantamount to adding wings to a tiger. In the future, the people will be devastated, and no one knows where it will end. What could be more sad than this? Chen Mingshu and his like can be said to be guilty of unpardonable crimes. The majority of our overseas Chinese are from Fujian and Guangdong. When Fujianese overseas Chinese hear that Chen and others are causing disaster in their hometown, they will naturally not sit idly by. Fujian and Guangdong are neighboring provinces with a close relationship. Overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Fujian have always been harmonious overseas, sharing weal and woe. They must also worry that the war will spread and the raging tide will engulf the Baiyue region. They will naturally find it difficult to stand by and do nothing. We hope that they will uphold their usual enthusiasm for supporting the party and the country and unanimously advocate a large-scale denunciation. The future of the nation depends on it. November 22nd, the 22nd year of the Republic of China." (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin previously stated that North China's military expenses were deficient by approximately 450,000 each month. Due to military influence, the income of the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar has recently decreased sharply, making it impossible to remit the original amount to Beiping. Therefore, North China's military expenses are becoming increasingly difficult. He previously invited Yu and Song to Beiping to discuss specific measures. It was decided that the 500,000 that Hebei Province should remit each month be reduced to 300,000, and the 300,000 that Chahar Province should remit each month be reduced to 100,000. Starting from December 1st, the funds that the Beining and PingSui Railways and the Beiping and Tianjin Municipal Governments should remit will all be remitted to Beiping.

<p>(Beiping) Someone from Shenyang said that Japan and Manchukuo's military preparations against Soviet Russia are becoming increasingly tense. In recent days, large numbers of Japanese troops have landed at Rajin Port and been transported to Harbin via Jilin, and a large number of cavalry artillery troops have been sent to Manchuria. However, the Japanese military movements are still under the guise of suppressing bandits, and transportation is mostly at night. After the news that Japanese aircraft flew into Russian territory on the 8th of this month, it was also publicized in Andong that Russia almost flew to Changchun, Harbin, and other places to scout. It is heard that the Japanese puppet authorities plan to temporarily move the puppet capital to Lushun in the event of war between Japan and Russia. Currently, the puppet capital is prohibiting citizens from spreading the news that war between Japan and Russia is about to break out. Because the United States and Russia announced the resumption of diplomatic relations, Japan has invisibly softened its attitude towards Russia, changing its usual arrogant attitude to avoid escalating the situation. In other news, Japan is still secretly deploying troops and actively preparing for war. Recently, various intelligence reports on northern Manchuria have been transmitted by airplane, which shows the tension. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(London) The most important declaration of Great Britain since the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference was the speech made today by Foreign Secretary Simon in the Lower House, stating that Great Britain has now informed the French government that it hopes that France can begin direct negotiations with Germany on the issue of disarmament. Simon also stated that no matter how the issue of disarmament progresses in the future, it will be meaningless without the participation of Germany. Therefore, it is also hoped that Germany can cooperate in all negotiations in the spirit of a companion, not just signing the agreements that have already been drafted by other countries. Simon later reported that Great Britain had notified the Italian government of its pleasure at the determination shown by Italian diplomatic and political circles, who said that future methods of diplomatic mediation should not damage the credibility of the Disarmament Conference. Furthermore, according to what Simon announced today, Great Britain expressed its willingness to mediate when it notified the French government of its support for direct negotiations between Germany and France, so that an understanding could be reached between Berlin and Paris as soon as possible.

<p>(New York) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, in a speech today at the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce in New York, stated that he hoped the United States and Russia would join hands to maintain peace, especially in the Far East. Litvinov's speech broadly discussed political issues, with a particular emphasis on expressing the Soviet Union's desire to maintain world peace. Litvinov believed that the deadlock at the disarmament conference was the fault of Germany and Japan. He also attacked the National Socialist Party's anti-Semitic activities and Germany's adoption of war-like plans, claiming that preparations for a new war are currently underway with full force. Young people are being indoctrinated with the idea of glorious war. He also said that in other countries, war preparations are being openly made, no longer seeking to disguise them with scientific theories. If war is to be regarded as an illegal weapon of national policy, and the effectiveness of peace treaties is to be maintained, then these countries will strongly insist that they do not apply to areas within their sphere of influence. Anyone who expresses doubts about this situation will be deemed disloyal, as their so-called loyalty must accept and encourage violent acts of aggression. He also said that the League of Nations is as good as dead, and no one can revive it. According to Litvinov, the "other countries" he mentioned were clearly referring to Japan, though he did not explicitly name them. After his speech at the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce today, Litvinov spent the day discussing matters with members of the Amtorg Trading Corporation, the Soviet trade organization in the United States. It is said that he will take the Conte Savoia tomorrow, heading to Russia via Italy, to fulfill an invitation from Mussolini. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

Upon his return to the United States, he drafted a report urging the powers to recognize the Moscow government and invite it to participate in the peace conference, rather than attempting to interfere in Russian politics. Therefore, he is highly regarded by the Russian side. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>

During this round of talks, both sides will exchange important opinions, the content of which will not be leaked to the outside world.

<p>(Tokyo) The Navy Ministry unanimously advocates for the establishment of a Disarmament Research Committee to address the 1935 Disarmament Conference. Its establishment has recently been decided.

The committee will hold its first meeting after the cabinet decision on the next fiscal year's budget. Starting with the next meeting, proposals will be discussed, and by February of next year, a policy on countermeasures for the disarmament conference will be decided. A proposal will also be made to establish a liaison and coordination mechanism with the Army, Foreign Ministry, and Ministry of Finance. It is planned to formulate concrete disarmament countermeasures by June. (Dentsu Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the opposition of the Privy Council, Foreign Minister Hirota has made some revisions to former Foreign Minister Uchida's proposal for the Examination Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice Minister Shigemitsu submitted the revised proposal to the Privy Council, which has been understood by the Privy Council. The proposal will be submitted to the Privy Council's scrutiny committee on the 27th. The main points of Hirota's proposal are as follows: (1) Function: Uchida's proposal had a broad function, and could be called the Foreign Policy General Staff, with a political color. Hirota's proposal is a de facto administrative body, mainly focusing on adjusting external intelligence and cultivating diplomatic personnel, within the functional scope of the Information Department and the future Disarmament Affairs Investigation Division. (2) Composition: Uchida's proposal established three divisions under the head of the appointed officials. Hirota's proposal consists of five divisions with appointed officials, directly under the Vice Minister. (Dentsu Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(New York) Former New York Governor Smith, a central figure in the Democratic Party, trusted by millions of party members, and the party's presidential candidate in 1928, today sent an open letter to the New York Chamber of Commerce, vehemently attacking the US President's monetary policy. He called on the nation to jointly support sound currency, stating, "I do not believe that the fate of the Democratic Party should be permanently linked to those who do not redeem paper money, those who overprint banknotes, those who advocate the free coinage of silver, those who manually manipulate currency, those who manufacture rubber gold coins, and those who are fond of high-sounding but impractical talk. Our country's currency standard must be absolutely reliable, as it is the only thing that can restore public confidence. The current government's financial actions are enough to lose public confidence, so I support a return to the gold standard, advocate for a gold currency, argue for experience, and oppose experimentation." He also said, "I would rather see private management of industry and commerce than government agencies acting as agents. The current government is unduly encroaching on industry and commerce." He also stated that if he had to choose between contracting currency and expanding currency, he would rather slightly contract it. The letter also vehemently attacked the US President's brain trust, claiming, "I would rather follow past leaders than trust inexperienced young university professors. These people have not held public office but want to turn 130 million Americans into guinea pigs for experimentation." (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(New York) Local sources explained that the reason why the US government's controlled currency policy has been implemented without encountering obstacles in foreign markets is that the US Federal Reserve Bank has declared to the central banks of Britain and France, guaranteeing that even if the US dollar exchange rate falls, it will not fall below the level equivalent to the price of gold per ounce. The central banks of Britain and France have also allowed the US to fulfill this promise, and Britain and France will not take retaliatory measures as long as the US can fulfill it.

<p>(London) The decision by the Japanese Ministry of Finance to increase the official purchase price of gold to 2 yen and 65 sen per gram has been given various interpretations by people in London. Some say that Japan has been exporting gold for some time, and now it may not do so anymore. Apart from this, Japan's move to increase the price of gold may not affect the world gold market because Japan's gold mine production is not much. However, its impact on raising domestic prices and encouraging exports may be quite significant. Since Japan has purchased gold at a high price, its currency price will naturally fall. This level can benefit Japan, because Japan's debt amount last year totaled 600 million yen, and the low price of its rice will also make Japan suffer even more. At the same time, if the US dollar continues to fall, the sales of Japanese silk in the United States, which have recently increased significantly, may be greatly affected. The United States is a large country with large-scale production, and the low price of its currency is enough to harm Japan's general export trade. Japan's increase in the price of gold, it is said, is to immediately suppress the currency value, probably also taking into account the impact of the continued decline of the US dollar. It is said that Japan has now begun to manufacture its own cars, and recently exported two vehicles to Western Fiji, with a selling price of 80 pounds sterling. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Paris) After the resignation of the Sarraut cabinet, President Lebrun continued to seek opinions from all sides at 2:10 p.m. The chairman of the Radical Democratic Party group in the Senate, Benveniste, visited the President and left after a half-hour meeting. Benveniste claimed that he was very sorry for the current political crisis. He also said that his opposition to currency inflation was even greater than before. Former Prime Minister Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, met with the President for 35 minutes. Outside, he refused to issue any political statement, only saying that the Radical Socialist Party was scheduled to hold a meeting at 6 p.m. to discuss the political situation. The President then received Mr. Chappedelaine, chairman of the Left Radical Party group in the House of Representatives, who advocated building a new government based on broad republicanism. The chairman of the Republican Union Party group in the Senate, Ordinaire, advocated amending the constitution to strengthen the authority of the government. Otherwise, a coalition cabinet should be established, but the Socialist Party would not participate. Subsequently, Socialist Party leader Blum visited the President and declared that the party's newspaper "Le Populaire" would publish a Socialist Party manifesto tomorrow, demanding to take power and implement the party's plans for stimulating the economy and reforming taxes as outlined in the motion (this motion was rejected by the House of Representatives yesterday). Blum also said that the Socialist Party is always ready to help with acceptable methods for solving the budget problem. The leader of the right wing, former Prime Minister Tardieu, explained that the current situation is similar to the spring of 1926, but today the foreign troubles are particularly serious. Therefore, he intended to follow the method adopted by the Poincaré cabinet in 1926. Former Minister of Justice Barthou believed that the political situation was extremely serious and that unity was essential. This unity, regardless of the name, is the main condition for taking measures to benefit the country and the people. The chairman of the Left Republican Party group in the House of Representatives advocated organizing a lasting government based on the majority party of the Republican Party. In the evening, President Lebrun summoned former Interior Minister Flandin (a member of the Radical Socialist Party) for a meeting lasting more than an hour.

(2) A cabinet organized entirely by the Radical Socialist Party. (3) A Republican concentration cabinet, whose members range from the extreme left to the Socialist Party, and the extreme right to the Marin faction. Representatives of these two parties would not be allowed to participate. This is in line with the approach proposed by former Prime Minister Sarraut. In any case, it goes without saying that the new government must give top priority to solving the financial problem. Le Jour said, "France must have a national salvation cabinet."

(Japan Associated Press Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Five Ministers' Conference, the political situation in Japan has been such that the financial groups have gradually regained their leadership. For example, the May 15th Incident has been settled, and Count Makino, the Minister of the Imperial Household who was rumored to be resigning, has also decided to stay in office. All of these matters are causing anxiety among the young officers and fascists in the military. Regarding the budget issue, Army Minister Araki will also make concessions to Minister of Finance Kayabuchi. If this happens, it will further increase the power of the financial groups. The fascists are very worried about the result. Today, under the name of the National Polity Preservation Association, a patriotic citizens' congress was convened in Shiba Park in Tokyo to vehemently attack the current government, loudly advocating the Showa Restoration, overthrowing the Saito Cabinet, and promoting a strong cabinet. Mitsuru Toyama, the leader of the Ronin, and Tanaka, the former Palace Minister who went to Tokyo to urge the Minister of the Imperial Household to resign, also attended the meeting, vigorously promoting patriotic ideas and opposing financial group politics.

The prefectural authorities became very panicked and resolved to continue the search. This morning at 11 o'clock, twelve communist teachers, including Hara, were found in the Aomori Normal School. Hara was the initiator, graduated from the Faculty of Arts of Tokyo Imperial University, and obtained a bachelor's degree. It is reported that there are more than these dozen people involved in the incident. (China United Press Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating over ten members of the Far Eastern Peace and Friendship Association, including Kanju Kato, on suspicion of being communist party members. It has now been learned that they have organized a proletarian group council to maintain the World Anti-War Conference held in Shanghai earlier. Therefore, a few days ago, Kiyozō Takahashi (24, Miyazaki Prefecture), a graduate of the art school and the Minister of the Anti-Imperialist National Organization, as well as Seiji Sasaki and Masao Hamada, were arrested. Through this investigation, their relationship with the Anti-War Conference will become clear. However, there will be a continuous stream of people being arrested, and this matter is particularly noteworthy. (Dentsu Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(China United Press Tokyo Correspondent) On the 20th of this month, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced the details of breaking up the Red Labor Union. The National Council of Japanese Labor Unions is a labor union affiliated with the Japanese Communist Party, and its organization is very strict. The number of workers under its leadership reaches 30,000. Due to the bleak domestic economy, social unrest, and international diplomacy being isolated, the people's livelihood cannot be stabilized. In order to prevent revolution and foreign warfare, the military has begun its wartime mobilization organization. The Japanese Communist Party and the "National Council" took the opportunity to act, plotting to sabotage military industries and their wartime organization. The Japanese military and police are panicked and have stepped up the crackdown. From January to October, 1,696 people have been arrested. The situation in Japan is so serious that the future of society is truly bleak. Its important work is as follows: (1) Plotting to sabotage military industries. The "National Council" especially focused on sabotaging military industries. The Niigata Iron Factory in Urakawa, the Miyashita Bicycle Manufacturing Plant, the Hitachi Manufacturing Plant in Kamedo-cho, the Bankosya in Oshima-cho, the Hydrographic Department of the Navy Ministry, the Tokyo Municipal Electric Bureau, and the Tokyo Electric Light Company all have its cells organized. The organization within the Hydrographic Department of the Navy Ministry is particularly large. Kiyojiro Ono, a clerk in the department, and his accomplices obtained confidential naval maps and attempted to commit misconduct. They have been destroyed. (2) Reddening the aristocratic society. The number of nobles or their children participating in the "National Council" exceeds 20. In the spring of this year, Toshishige Mori, the eldest son of Viscount Toshinari Mori, age 26, and students, children of aristocratic families, etc., over 40 people were arrested. Among them, Imperial University student Kimimune Ogura, the younger brother of Viscount Yoshiki Ogura, age 24, and Saburo Mizoguchi, a baron age 27, and Sadao Yamaguchi, the younger brother of Baron Masao Yamaguchi, age 24, are the most capable members. Viscounts Mori and Hachijo resigned from the House of Peers for their misdeeds. Sadao Yamaguchi's mother also resigned from the Imperial Palace Ladies-in-Waiting. The student director of the Gakushuin School, Baba, also resigned. The aristocratic society became bleak, so they hired senior police officers from the Metropolitan Police Department to hold lectures on preventing communist thought. The purpose of these activities against the aristocracy is to collect funds.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese raw silk market prices have continued to fall for days due to the decline in the US dollar. Recent market prices have hovered around 510 yuan, causing great difficulties for Japanese silk factories and silkworm farmers. There are 2.12 million silkworm farming households in Japan, with 16 million people depending on them for a living. Now, with the fall in silk prices, their lives are in extreme panic. During the prosperous period of the Taisho 11th year, Japanese silk was worth 1,904 yuan per 100 catties. Before the September 18th Incident, in Showa 6th year, it was worth 581 yuan. The average for the first half of this year was also 769 yuan. Now it is only around 500 yuan, which is almost the same as the market price before the May 15th Incident. Moreover, current prices are higher than before, making life increasingly difficult for farmers. Silk factories in Nagano Prefecture have completely shut down. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to hold a joint meeting with representatives of silk factories and silkworm farmers to study countermeasures. (25th, China United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry held a meeting of the heads of internal affairs departments of various prefectures in Tokyo today to deliberate on rural countermeasures.

Therefore, the content of today's meeting aims to make the Minister of Finance reflect. (25th, China United Press)</p>

Also, Liu Zhi's telegram to Fujian arrived in Hankou on the 25th, and He Chengjun replied in response. (25th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun, etc., submitted a telegram to the Central Government, which was sent out on the evening of the 25th, roughly stating that Chen Mingshu caused chaos in Fuzhou, that the rebel party betrayed the country, colluded with the communists internally, and conspired with the Japanese externally, bringing together the Third Party, Social Democrats, and Communist Cancellation Faction in a new guise, which is truly a rare and strange change since the founding of the Republic of China. Chen Mingshu, as a member of the Central Committee, willingly engaged in this, and the soldiers of the 19th Route Army were also held hostage. They feared that the communists could prolong their lives and that foreigners could take the opportunity to invade. Chengjun and others, as soldiers, were responsible for quelling the chaos. If they were ordered to do so, they would do their best. They hoped that the Central Government would clearly order the suppression, that all parties would uphold justice, and that they would jointly denounce the rebellion in order to cut off Japanese coveting and eliminate the remnants of the communists, so that the foundation of the country would not be shaken and the people's livelihood could be stabilized.

Even if the whole country unites, it may not be enough to save the country. However, Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, etc., as members of the Central Committee, did not hesitate to collude with the Communist Party, which was abandoned by the whole country, and gather all reactionary elements to occupy a corner, change the era name, destroy unity, and betray the Central Government. Anyone with a heart would be indignant. They should ask the Central Government to make a quick decision and severely punish them in order to correct discipline and consolidate the foundation of the country. Yingqin and others belong to the military and are responsible for guarding the country. They will sincerely obey and await orders. (25th, Special Dispatch)</p>

At the same time, they colluded with the communists to help them act wantonly. They also received a secret telegram from Chairman Chiang Yangxu to Gan and a letter to all the generals and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, Chen Ni Mingshu, colluding with the communists to conspire with the Japanese to destroy the party and betray the country, ordering them to quickly deal with it and strictly guard against it. In my opinion, the country is in dire straits internally and facing foreign troubles. It is time for the people of the country to unite sincerely and share the national crisis. Now the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi Province has been winning victories, and the bandit areas in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have been completely recovered. Saving the country and surviving is at this time. How could Chen Mingshu, etc., collude with the communists and conspire with the Japanese and occupy him to rebel? Not only are they accomplices to bandits, but they are also ruining the lives of the people. They are trying to destroy the unity of the country and plunge the nation into an irrecoverable abyss. Zhenhua and others are serving in the military and are responsible for defending the country. I am willing to hold a gun and await orders and move forward for the country.

Delin is determined to rectify the internal affairs and will not add any organizations. When the Fujian upheaval occurred, Chen Mingshu sent a representative to pay respects to Delin, who declared his submission to the Central Government's internal pacification and external resistance. However, Fujian did not listen to advice. If they wanted to impose sanctions, the strength was insufficient, so they returned to Guilin from Nanning and will absolutely not enter Guangdong again to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool.

<p>A telegram from Yunnan: All newspaper offices are informed that they have received a telegram from the Central Government, and it is known that Chen Mingshu and others in Fujian colluded with communists and other reactionary elements to recklessly form a government, which is absurd. At this time of serious national crisis, how should we unite and overcome difficulties together? However, this kind of betrayal of the party and the country is shocking and outrageous. It is also heard that they have arbitrarily assumed the title of Commander-in-Chief of Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Guizhou, and Hunan, which is extremely absurd and intolerable by national law and party discipline. We should ask the Central Government to denounce and punish them in order to warn the stubborn. We respectfully report our heartfelt thoughts and ask for your understanding. Long Yun kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Fujian Students' Association in Beijing Asks for a Swift Resolution of the Fujian Affair: They Also Urge Li and Chen to Retreat from the Brink <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News: The Fujian Students' Association in Beijing heard some time ago that there would be changes in Fujian. Zhang Yin, Wu Delu, Guo Zhaopi, Chen Dayuan, Lin Hao, Zhang Bo, Chen Lei and other executive directors and directors of the association, sent a telegram to the Fujian political and military authorities, advising them to put the overall situation first and not make changes. Recently, Fujian Province has established a government and declared independence. In addition to separately submitting reports to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Commission to swiftly resolve the situation as soon as possible and save the people of Fujian from misery, they have also sent a telegram to Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu, urging them to retreat from the brink. The texts of the telegrams and reports are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The text of the telegram to Li Chen et al. reads, "The Fujian Provincial Government in Fuzhou, addressed to Mr. Li Renchao, Chen Zhenru, Jiang Jingran, and Cai Xianchu, we are shocked to read in the newspapers that Fujian has established a government and declared independence. Our Fujian is plagued by bandits and communists, and powerful Japan is watching closely. Once something happens, it will inevitably become more rampant. Moreover, Fujian is poor and barren, and in recent years, the supplies have been exhausted. There is nowhere to increase the burden. Furthermore, your army's glorious resistance to Japan and its oath not to participate in civil wars are admired by the whole country, and you should not make any differences to lose credibility. We urge you to retreat from the brink and abolish the organization in order to avoid ruining the region and burdening the people of Fujian. We respectfully kowtow. Fujian Students' Association in Beijing, Executive Directors Zhang Yin, Wu Delu, Guo Zhaopi, et al." (2) The report to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Commission reads, "Report requesting swift resolution of Chen Mingshu's and others' rebellion and disaster in Fujian to save the people of Fujian from misery. Our Fujian has suffered from corrupt politics and bandit disasters in recent years. The region is devastated, and the people are in dire straits. Last year, the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, and the provincial government was reorganized. We celebrated that someone was responsible and that suppression and governance could be expected. However, after more than a year, the governance performance was not evident, and the sound of extortion was constant. However, the people of Fujian still believed that the military expenses were urgent and tried to supply them, hoping that the 19th Route Army, which has the glory of resisting Japan, would not harm us. Recently, we read in the newspapers that the leaders of the 19th Route Army, Chen Mingshu and others, colluded with reactionary elements and frustrated politicians to organize a so-called People's Government in Fujian to resist the Central Government. Upon hearing this, we were shocked. Fujian is poor and has reached its limit. Regular political expenses and military salaries still need to rely on the assistance of the Central Government and Guangdong Province. Now that they have established their own government, set up agencies, and expanded military preparations, the expenses will be even greater. They will inevitably exhaust the pond to catch fish and dig the marrow to pay tribute. The people of Fujian are exhausted and impoverished, how can they bear it? This is the first way in which Chen Mingshu and others' rebellion will destroy the people's livelihood. Bandits and communists are everywhere in Fujian, and it is difficult to suppress them. The 19th Route Army has been suppressing them for more than a year, but they have not achieved any success in eliminating them. They have even resorted to recruiting bandits, which shows that their skills are exhausted. Recently, they have gone against the grain and accommodated the communists, announcing that land is owned by the public in order to win the favor of leftists. If they disrupt the order of Fujian and destroy the social organization in this way, it is unlikely that Fujian will not become a red zone like Jiangxi Province. This is the second way in which Chen Mingshu and others' rebellion will fuel the flames of the bandits. Moreover, Fujian is adjacent to Taiwan, and the Japanese have coveted it for a long time. Once something happens in Fujian, they may take the opportunity to start a war under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese, or they may secretly manipulate and aid the chaos. If any of these things happen, Fujian will be in danger. We believe that internal pacification and external resistance are the established policies of the Central Government, and that unnecessary sacrifices should be avoided in order to avoid damaging the country's vitality. If the Japanese invaders are attracted to Fujian by this Fujian upheaval and repeat the mistakes of the Eastern Provinces, then we will not have control of Fujian, and the southeastern provinces will also be in danger. This is the third way in which Chen Mingshu and others' rebellion will attract the Japanese invaders. All of these points are of great importance to the situation in Fujian and the country. If they are not dealt with swiftly and resolved as soon as possible, the situation will expand and cause endless harm. We, the members of this association, are citizens of Fujian and dare not remain silent about what we see as dangerous. Therefore, we respectfully submit this report to your court, requesting you to swiftly resolve the situation as soon as possible and save the people of Fujian from misery. We are eagerly awaiting orders. Sincerely submitted."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Each Mongolian Banner Will Organize District Governments; Inner Mongolia's Autonomy Issue Is Completely Resolved; De Wang Abandoned His Claim for High Degree of Autonomy <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence: The Inner Mongolia issue, after Huang Shaohong and Zhao Pilian stayed in Bailingmiao for a week and held multiple talks with De Wang and others, and through the mediation of the Panchen Lama and A Wang, finally reached a result on the night of November 17th. Huang, Zhao, and their entourage left Bailingmiao on the 19th to return to Suiyuan. Liu Puchen, specially dispatched by the General Staff Headquarters to accompany Huang and Zhao to Bailingmiao for inspection on the 18th, returned to Suiyuan from Bailingmiao ahead of them, accompanied by Huang's secretary, Zhuo Hongmou, and several members of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's envoy, Ba Wenjun. Zhuo Hongmou was seriously injured in Bailingmiao on the 17th when his car overturned on the way to Yun Wang's residence, and he vomited blood on the spot. After a brief stop in Suiyuan, he left for Ping for medical treatment on the 19th. Liu Puchen, Ba Wenjun, and others stayed at the Suiyuan Hotel. Liu talked about the Bailingmiao meeting in detail, and a brief record is as follows: "After Huang, Zhao, and their party arrived in Bailingmiao, apart from banquets and other social engagements, no formal meetings were held. De Wang and Huang held meetings several times, but without concrete results, because Huang insisted on implementing the central government's plan, organizing the Mongolian Banner Political Committee, and establishing a closer relationship with the local government. De Wang insisted on organizing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government and refused to concede. Huang repeatedly expressed his intention to return to Suiyuan, but was persuaded to stay several times without success. Until the evening of the 17th, there were still no concrete results. Huang and Zhao decided to leave Bailingmiao on the 18th to return to Suiyuan no matter what. Through the mediation of the Panchen Lama, De Wang resolutely abandoned his consistent position late at night and asked the Panchen Lama to persuade Huang to stay in Bailingmiao for one more day. It was generally decided that the organization of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government would no longer be discussed. In the future, Mongolian Banner Autonomous Region governments will be established separately, identified by numbers, such as the First, Second, and Third Districts, etc. The organization of the district government and its contact with the local government were decided in principle. De Wang then presented a written statement to Huang, and Huang agreed to stay in Bailingmiao for one more day on the 18th to discuss the detailed methods. At this point, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government issue, which had caused a great uproar, came to an end and can be said to be completely resolved. Huang and Zhao spent their last day in Bailingmiao on the 18th, conducting research and engaging in social activities simultaneously. With their mission accomplished, they decided to leave Bailingmiao on the 19th to return to Suiyuan." Liu also said that on the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue, most people do not understand this move by the Mongolian compatriots. In fact, self-defense is a human instinct. Three provinces have fallen, Rehe has also been lost, and eastern Mongolia is gone. Western Mongolia must accumulate strength to rescue itself, protect the territory, and secure the borders. The Mongolian compatriots, in view of this situation, rose up and urgently sought self-help. We should absolutely sympathize with them, but the methods need to be studied further. Through the inspection of Minister Huang and Vice-Chairman Zhao, the central government and Inner Mongolia have established close ties. From now on, the whole country, from top to bottom, will pay attention to Mongolia, work hard to manage it, consolidate the borders, and strengthen national defense. It may not be that this incident has promoted it, etc. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Changsha's Bond-Raising Craze; Key Figures in Various Industries Arrested; He Yuanwen Accuses Merchants of Being Reactionary; Those Arrested Escorted to Pingxiang; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Pleads with He Jian for Their Release <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province issued 5 million yuan of national salvation bonds. The Changsha business community was assigned 360,000 yuan based on operating capital, which was later reduced to 60% of that, or 210,000 yuan. Because the merchants only paid 46,000 yuan and were delayed in paying the full amount, the provincial government sent soldiers to strictly urge payment from house to house. Except for the money, silk, and gold industries with strong capital, which directly negotiated with the provincial government and paid 9,000 yuan first to get the soldiers withdrawn, the other industries believed that the distribution of public debt was uneven. On the 16th, they held a joint secret meeting and decided on six measures, the most important of which were: (1) To organize a temporary office for various industries to oppose the extra levy of national salvation bonds, and to elect Cui Bohong, chairman of the pigment industry, Huang Juqiao of the pharmaceutical industry, Yuan Yousheng, chairman of the paper industry, Chen Lanshu, chairman of the dry goods industry, Xu Tianxi, chairman of the dyeing industry, Li Dongxian, chairman of the oil industry, Yu Jianfan, chairman of the oil, salt, cotton, and yarn industry, Wei Lansheng, chairman of the book industry, Wei Guisong, chairman of the Jiangsu and Guangdong goods industry, Huang Boxun, chairman of the hardware industry, and Wang Boqing, chairman of the rice industry, to be responsible for everything. (2) If the provincial government arrests people to forcibly collect national salvation bonds, all businesses will go on strike. (3) If any industry undermines the united movement and independently subscribes to public bonds, they will be punished. (4) Print slogans with the wording "This store is unable to pay extra national salvation bonds and will cease operations," and prepare to post them at the doors of each store during the strike. The situation was extremely tense. Later, Zhang Kailian, Director of the Finance Department, and Zuo Yizhai and Wang Pinxin, standing committee members of the Changsha Municipal Chamber of Commerce, convened a joint meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members on the afternoon of the 17th and decided on two measures: (1) Request the government to withdraw the soldiers first. All unpaid public debt will be negotiated and handled by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with the government. (2) Request the industry guilds to suspend the prepared strike resolution and wait for the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to resolve it. As a result, the soldiers who were sitting in the stores urging payment on the 18th were withdrawn, and the strike trend had eased. Unexpectedly, He Yuanwen, the mayor of Changsha in charge of raising public bonds, rushed to Pingxiang on the 17th and secretly reported to He Jian that Changsha merchants, incited by reactionaries, were planning to use the issue of raising public bonds to carry out a strike in order to disrupt the rear. He immediately telegraphed Hu Da, commander of the Provincial Garrison Command, to arrest the eleven people in charge of the temporary offices of various industries and escort them to Pingxiang for investigation. After Hu received the order, he invited the eleven people to the headquarters for a talk early on the 18th. Only Huang Juqiao, Cui Bohong, Yuan Yousheng, Xu Tianxi, Yu Jianfan, Li Dongxian, Chen Lanshu, and Wei Guisong arrived at the headquarters at that time. Except for Wei Guisong, who was released on bail due to illness, the other seven people were immediately escorted to the headquarters of the Western Route General Headquarters in Pingxiang and held in solitary confinement, treated as bandits who disrupted public order, and were not allowed to communicate or meet with anyone. At the same time, officials were sent to inform the newspapers, instructing them not to publish news about this case. Troops were also dispatched to arrest the three who had not been arrested, Wei Lansheng, Wu Boxun, and Wang Boqing. The city was in a state of panic, and the merchants were especially uneasy. On the day the chairmen of various industries were escorted to Pingxiang, He Jian happened to return to the province from Pingxiang. Zuo Yizhai, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and key figures from the Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters went to pay their respects and inquire about the matter. He said that they were instigated by bad people to disrupt the rear of Changsha, printed slogans, and incited strikes, which was indeed conclusive evidence and must be severely punished. Zuo and others tried their best to explain, saying that although their words and texts were careless, they were not being used by others to plot against the government and pleaded for leniency. However, He Jian, in his anger, insisted on severe punishment, so there was no result. On the 20th, He Jian also explained the matter in an expanded memorial week report, saying that the army was fighting bandits on the front line, but the reactionaries were disrupting the rear, which was deeply hated and must be strictly punished according to law. As a result, the situation became more serious. On the 21st, various industries in Changsha held a meeting in the city and provincial capital to discuss rescue measures. It was decided that Zuo Yizhai and Wang Pinxin would present a statement to He Jian to explain the misunderstanding and prove that the arrested chairmen and committee members had not committed any illegal acts, and acknowledged that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce would be responsible for overall planning regarding the issue of raising public bonds in the future. At the same time, Zhang Kailian and others also tried their best to intercede with He Jian, so that the arrested people might not be in any danger. However, the written statement from various industries was submitted to He Jian on the evening of the 21st, but He had already left Changsha at 3 pm that afternoon. When He will return is still unknown. The outcome of this case will not be known until He returns to the province. (November 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Xuzhou: Paper Money Panic Gradually Subsides; Business Still Depressed; Finance Still Panicked <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xuzhou private paper money panic has gradually subsided. The establishment of the Public Exchange Office was originally intended to help the poor, but gathering all the companies in one place with a large number of people led to repeated tragedies. Since yesterday (the 23rd), Gongyu, Shixingchang, and Tianbaoyu have begun to redeem their own paper money. Gongyu has obtained a loan of 20,000 yuan from the banking community by discounting from reliable shareholders to maintain the redemption, while the liquidation office is still handling the liquidation. The redeemed paper money is sealed up daily. Shixingchang and Tianbaoyu are solely owned by private individuals who circulate cash on their own to maintain the current redemption, and they also seal up the paper money as they redeem it. Bu Xinji, Chunquan, Yizhenxiang, and Juhechang are still redeeming their paper money at the Public Exchange Office. Once each company has raised cash, they will withdraw from the Public Exchange Office separately and redeem their own paper money. However, the situation of public and private redemption at each company is still very crowded, but the number of people has been slightly dispersed, so that tragedies will not occur again.</p>
<p>The Money Ticket Cleaning Committee established by the county government will thoroughly clean up private money tickets. Each ticket has been observing the situation, planning to maintain the current trend in the past, and thinking about continuing to issue them in order to make a comeback. Some are also aware of their emptiness and have privately misappropriated account assets and industries, planning to settle the matter with a collapse. People in the society have now understood everything and are determined to maintain a permanent ban and thorough compensation. If their property is insufficient, they are determined to demand severe punishment by law. Therefore, private tickets have now become a dead end. The ticket merchants, who have been criticized by the society, have also been unable to come up with a solution. However, whether the subsequent step-by-step implementation will be able to persist depends on the political parties and authorities.</p>
<p>At present, the market is inconsistent in its use or rejection of various tickets. Large stores avoid trouble and refuse to use them all together. Small businesses will either stop operating without them, or use them reluctantly, with discounts of 20% or 10%, which is extremely chaotic. The depression of business and the panic of finance have both plummeted. It is feared that the situation will be even more unbearable by the end of the year. (24th)</p>

<p>In the deserted mounds of Caojiajing in Xinqu District 20, there is the tomb of Li Jingjiang, a famous general of the Ming Dynasty, which has been around for more than 500 years. Unexpectedly, Xia Damazi (also known as Zaiqin) from Yancheng hired many workers at the beginning of this month to excavate it. A total of nine coffins made of Phoebe nanmu were dug up, and each one was opened. The corpses were all intact, but they decayed immediately after being exposed to the wind. Jade and porcelain burial objects were looted and disappeared immediately. The local people learned about the incident and suspected that Zhang Wanyao, the district chief of the area, had instigated it, and filed complaints with the party and government agencies. The county government has sent personnel to investigate the case. Xia Damazi, who was at large, has been captured by Hua Wenren, a patrol officer from the 10th police station in Xinqiao, and transferred to the prosecutor's office of the county court for interrogation and detention.</p>

<p>Wang Xianglong, a villager from Linglou, Jiaodiaowan, had two sons, Yuelou and Xinglou, who were both married, and a married daughter. On the 20th of this month, they split the family property and lived separately. On the 23rd, his daughter returned to Ning to visit. At night, the old father was preparing the bed for his daughter and asked his eldest daughter-in-law for a mosquito net. The daughter-in-law refused to give it, which caused an argument. Unexpectedly, the eldest son did not persuade them to stop, but joined in the whirlpool and struck his father with farm tools, injuring his head and waist, causing his father to die under the stick. The situation was very tragic. The second son, Xinglou, was filled with grief and indignation and petitioned the court to seek justice. On the 25th, a prosecutor supervised the coroner and police to conduct an examination.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Bizarre Details of Murder Case in Jiaozhi, Suzhou <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The murder case in Xishi, Jiaozhi Town, under the jurisdiction of Wukun County, is extremely tragic. The local court dispatched prosecutor Lu Wenqin, clerk Chen Penggeng, and coroner Xuan Fang to the countryside on the 24th to conduct an investigation. They felt that although the clues to this case were difficult to obtain quickly, there were several points worth studying. (1) Zhou, the mother of the deceased Ma Fushou, had already divided the property and awarded it to the deceased and her son-in-law Lu Fusheng. She herself was supported by her son Fushou and son-in-law Fusheng in rotation every five days. On the night of the incident, Zhou originally lived in her son's house and was invited to Zhang's wedding feast by her son-in-law. (2) When the property was divided in the 19th year, her son received sixteen mu of land, and her son-in-law only received eight mu of land on the surface. However, it was heard that Zhou had a total of more than one hundred mu of land, not including private savings, and her son-in-law Lu Fusheng built a huge new house in Xiatang after receiving the land, which neighbors discussed a lot. (3) Zhou's bedroom contained land deeds, silver dollars, and newly purchased clothing. Zhou did not lock the door of the room on the night of the incident. (4) If this case was a robbery, why was no property lost in the deceased's room? (5) If it was a case of adultery and jealousy, it would have been enough to kill Wang alone. The local court is currently investigating.</p>

<p>Yangzhong County is isolated in the middle of the river, with barren land and poor people, and strong folk customs. Unexpectedly, on the night before yesterday, a riot occurred due to resistance to grain taxes. At that time, the people of the third, fourth, and fifth districts gathered in droves and completely burned down the houses of district chiefs E Zhensheng and Zhang Yuanqiao, county executive committee member Zhang Zicheng, property office director Chen Fengren, gentry Du Chuqing, and others in the countryside, fortunately without injuring anyone. The public security team led the police to suppress the riot, killing one person on the spot and detaining four people. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the people beat gongs to gather a crowd and rushed to Sanmao South Street. They were defeated again by the brave attack of the public security team and the security regiment, killing four people on the spot and wounding one person. After the provincial government heard the news, it sent two companies of the security team to rush to suppress the riot.</p>

<p>The Taixin Silk Factory (the original site of the Yuanyou Silk Factory) near Changfeng Bridge on Guangqin Road, which had a total of 244 silk machines, was managed by Xu Junjie and assisted by Cheng Yinxiang. It started operating on September 1st of this year. Due to the tragic fall in the silk market, it suffered heavy losses. The factory had insured more than 10,000 taels of fire insurance with the Anding Insurance Company. Yesterday (the 25th) at about 1:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory's dried cocoon warehouse, causing a conflagration. Thick smoke filled the air, and flames shot out in all directions. Before long, it broke through the roof and was approaching the surroundings. When it was noticed, gongs were sounded to warn the neighborhood, and fire brigades from inside and outside the city rushed to the scene to put out the fire. As a result, 236 packages of dried cocoons, 10 packages of double palace cocoons, 14 packages of printed head rotten cocoons, 3 packages of cocoon clothing, 10 packages of long silk were burned, and four houses were destroyed, with a total loss of more than 10,000 yuan.

<p>Yin Guomin, a village guard from Shijia Garden, Shaobo South Township, borrowed a liter of rice noodles from his neighbor Wang Yaoshan, and then returned them. The Wang family made dumplings with them for the whole family's dinner. Unexpectedly, about an hour after eating, all seven members of the family suffered from headaches, abdominal pain, vomiting, and other symptoms of poisoning. The next morning, they negotiated with the Yin family. Yin also used the noodles to make pancakes for his whole family to eat. One after another, the same symptoms appeared as in the Wang family. The situation was very dangerous. It is said that a total of fourteen people from both families were victims and were taken to Shaobo Town for emergency medical treatment. Fortunately, they have escaped danger. Whether the rice noodles contain poison is currently being studied and tested.</p>

The district regiment headquarters has reported the situation of Xue Zhong'an's murder to the county government for approval. According to the report, the county government ordered the regiment leader to go to conduct an examination and report the details for verification.</p>

<p>In Gao Liuji, west of the county, Wang Zheng'en, an accomplice of Zhang Dabizi, led more than a thousand bandits to plunder the settlement and occupy it. He held a memorial service for Zhang Dabizi, which was extremely rampant. Du Run, the commander of the 40th regiment of the 7th Division, sent Bi Xuanwen, the commander of the third battalion, to attack and suppress them. The bandits stubbornly resisted by relying on the settlement. After the government troops launched a fierce attack with mortars and machine guns, killing two to three hundred bandits, the bandits could not hold out and fled from the settlement to Shouxian. The county magistrates of Hefei, Shouxian, Liu'an, Shucheng, and Dingyuan decided to hold a memorial service in Hefei, as the five counties were bordered by bandits, and the 40th Regiment had wiped them out one after another, and many officers and soldiers had been killed or injured. Preparations have begun, and the meeting is scheduled for the 28th to comfort the loyal souls.</p>

<p>Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan was rumored to have left Beijing for Shanghai yesterday, but his whereabouts were extremely secret. According to news, Chen did arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning and took the night train back to Beijing last night. The Jiangzhen warship of the Fujian Navy arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and the Haining warship arrived from Fujian yesterday and berthed at Gaochangmiao. Gao Xianjia, the captain of the Haining warship, met with Commander Chen Jiliang to report everything. Only three warships sailed south the day before yesterday, which sailed down from Nanjing.

<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai by night express train from Beijing at 7:30 yesterday morning. At 11:00, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence. According to him, the central government's motivation for sending someone to welcome Hu Zhantang to Beijing did not start today. It is because the national crisis is serious, and unity is not enough to save the crisis. As for the candidates to welcome him, whether it will be Zhang Ji and Chen Lifu, it will have to wait for the Central Standing Committee to make the final decision. Furthermore, the branches of the Central Bank of China in Fujian Province and the central tax collection agencies have been confiscated by force. If we want to save it, there is no effective method except to use decisive measures. However, Fujian's customs duties have not been robbed so far because they are guaranteed to repay foreign debts. The customs duties have been sent to the local Central Bank, and since the branch was confiscated, the money has been transferred to the Bank of China. The paper money of the Fuzhou and Xiamen branches of the Central Bank can be exchanged at the head office as usual.</p>

<p>At 1:20 yesterday afternoon, when the seventh express train arrived at Changzhou Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, a soldier guarding the railway exploded a hand grenade when the rope broke and it fell to the ground. One passenger and one soldier were killed on the spot, and one passenger and two soldiers were injured. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Soldiers Disembarking: More than 100 soldiers from the 4th company, 1st battalion, 523rd regiment, 362nd brigade, 88th division, commanded by Company Commander Cao Yingben, were ordered to transfer from Gaozi Station to Changzhou to guard the railway. Company Commander Cao led the team yesterday morning and set off on the 7th express train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, arriving at Changzhou at 1:20 pm. They disembarked at the front end of the north platform.</p>
<p>Grenade Explosion: At that time, a soldier exploded a hand grenade when the rope he was wearing broke and it suddenly fell to the ground. There was great chaos at the time. Zhong Jianhuai, the chief of the Changzhou police section of the railway, supervised and led the railway police to maintain order.</p>
<p>Casualties: After the investigation, it was found that two soldiers were injured. Sun Bohe, a second-class passenger from Zhenjiang to Shanghai and an employee of the Shanghai Bank, was injured in both legs. Hua Zhushan, a third-class passenger from Zhenjiang to Shanghai and an employee of Zhenjiang Fukang, died of serious injuries.

<p>Aftermath: The injured soldiers were handled by Company Commander Cao himself. The injured passenger Sun Bohe was given emergency surgery by the station doctor Gong and then sent to Wujin Hospital for treatment. The station chief telegraphed Zhenjiang to visit the family of the deceased passenger Hua Zhushan and come to Changzhou to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Train Continued: At the same time, three glass windows of the 605th second-class passenger car were also shattered by the explosion, but fortunately no passengers in the car were injured. The 7th express train left Changzhou as usual.</p>

<p>The Changjiang wheel steamer Ningjing of the Ningshao Company, which was loading cargo from Hankou back to Shanghai yesterday, suddenly ran aground while traveling near Huangshi Port. The ship has been flooded six feet. The company has now sent personnel to rescue. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e104">Ran Aground Yesterday Morning <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Ningjing ship set off from Hankou in the middle of the night on the 24th and sailed downstream to Shanghai. Yesterday at dawn, the ship was at a river surface 68 miles away from Huangshi Port near Jiujiang. Due to foggy weather, the pilot was careless, causing the ship to hit an underwater reef, breaking the bottom of the Ningjing ship and immediately flooding it.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Unable to Escape <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>After the Ningjing ship had an accident, the shipowner, Russian Gao Zilofu A. Kosloff, and the first and second mates Shi Junxin and Zhang Hai, immediately tried their best to find a way to escape the danger, but the ship was trapped in the reef, and after repeatedly starting the car, they could not drive away from the reef beach, and the river water poured into the ship wildly.</p>

<p>The Ningjing ship was loaded with more than 8,300 dan of goods, which were loaded in various cabins. After running aground, the shipowner sent a telegram to Shanghai to report to the company for rescue at 11:00 AM. At 5:00 PM, Ningshao received another radio message, saying that each cabin in the ship had been flooded six feet, which was very dangerous, and that many goods had been immersed in the water.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Sent Personnel to Inspect <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the news, the company felt that the matter was urgent and needed to be rescued immediately. After the company discussed, it immediately entrusted Hengchangxiang to assign technicians to rush to the scene of the accident for inspection in order to provide rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Ningshao Went to Rescue <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Ningshao Company decided to send the old Ningshao ship to fly to Huangshi Port to load and transport cargo and seek rescue, but the Ningshao ship was rented by the Transportation Department. That night, the company telegraphed the Transportation Department to negotiate the release so that it could go to the rescue, but it had not been resolved late at night.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, many shipping lines in Shanghai have suspended sailing and stopped transporting goods. The Fujian Ning San Guild in Shanghai specifically telegraphed Fujian for inquiries yesterday. At noon, they received a reply stating that Fujian was quiet as usual and could still load and unload passengers and goods, and that shipping lines were still sailing. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram of Peace: The Fujian Ning San Guild sent a special telegram to the Fuzhou Jardine branch, inquiring about everything in order to transport goods. The guild received a reply from the Jardine Matheson yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, I have a letter stating that I have telegraphed Fuzhou to inquire about the situation there. I hope you will acknowledge it. Now I have received a reply saying that the Jie Sheng ship will leave Shanghai on Sunday, the 26th, at 6:00 AM. The local area is peaceful as usual, and goods can be loaded and unloaded."</p>
<p>Fruit Shipment: Mr. Lin, a fresh fruit merchant from Fujian, told reporters yesterday that a large number of fruits from Fujian would have to be delayed for three weeks before they could be put on the market. This year's fresh fruit harvest is not as good as last year's, but olives have already been loaded and shipped. This item has not been interrupted. Two batches have already been shipped from Fuzhou and will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. The rumor that the entire shipment was blocked has actually affected the market and made fruit merchants uneasy.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Cotton Mills Buying Cotton - Exemption from Business Tax Approved - Ministry of Finance Considers Business Difficulties and Relieves Cotton Industry - Cotton Industry Control Committee's Letter to the Factory Association for Reference <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Cotton mills setting up stations in producing areas to purchase cotton had previously been granted an exemption from business tax by the Ministry of Finance out of consideration for the difficulties faced by businesses. This has been implemented in various provinces for some time. In Jiangsu Province, however, due to the lack of clear understanding by various business tax bureaus, there were instances where cotton purchasing stations were ordered to pay business tax. After reports were submitted by various factories to the National Economic Commission, the commission sent letters to both the ministry and the provincial government for consultation. It is now reported that a satisfactory resolution has been reached. Business tax bureaus in Jiangsu Province will no longer levy business tax on cotton purchasing stations established by cotton mills in cotton-producing areas. The original letter from the Cotton Industry Control Committee to the Cotton Mill Association is as follows: "Respectfully, we have repeatedly received letters reporting that Qingfeng, Shenxin, Yongan, Yukang, and other factories'</p>
<h3 id="e112">Cotton Purchasing in Various Locations <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>stations are being forced to pay taxes or having goods confiscated by business tax bureaus, and requesting measures to stop this. After this association separately sent letters to relevant authorities to instruct them to stop such practices, we also sent representatives to Beijing to present the situation to the Ministry of Finance and urge them to quickly formulate preventative measures. Now, we have received a reply from these representatives stating that the Ministry of Finance's policy regarding the exemption of cotton purchasing stations from business tax has been followed in provinces such as Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, and Chahar since the promulgation of the order. Previously, Jiangsu Province, based on Article 20 of the Business Tax Regulations, requested the Ministry to apply a different measure. However, because the matter concerned a general case, it was deemed inappropriate to treat Jiangsu Province differently. After detailed explanation, it was replied on the 20th of this month that the established method of exempting cotton purchasing stations from business tax should still be followed. Subsequent disputes should thus be resolved. Furthermore, we received a letter from the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance stating that the matter of cotton mills establishing purchasing stations in cotton-producing areas to purchase cotton for raw materials could not be exempted from tax due to existing regulations. Now, upon receiving an order from the Ministry of Finance, it has been decided that</p>
<h3 id="e113">Scope of Exemption <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>is limited to the raw materials used by the factory itself and should be followed accordingly. All bureaus have been notified to comply and detailed procedures for inspection, verification, and the issuance of tax exemption notices have been established. Cotton mills that need to send personnel to cotton-producing areas to purchase raw cotton should first report the required quantity to the business tax bureau in the location of the main factory, fill out a tax exemption form, and notify the business tax bureau in the cotton-producing area for inspection and verification to release the goods. When the raw cotton is transported back to the factory, the first part of the tax exemption form should be returned to the business tax bureau in the location of the main factory for verification. The registration licenses of the main factory and branch offices should also be sent to the bureau for inspection to comply with regulations. While every effort should be made to protect the raw materials used by cotton mills, strict precautions should also be taken to prevent shadow companies from exploiting loopholes and evading taxes, so as not to affect tax revenue and give rise to criticism. We hope that you will forward this to the cotton mills to follow the prescribed procedures, carry out the process in a responsible way, and supervise each other to prevent misuse by others, so that both the factories and tax authorities can benefit. We hereby send this letter to you, and we hope that you will inform the factories to take note and comply. This is addressed to the Chinese Cotton Mill Association."</p>
<h3 id="e114">Japanese Ships Issue New Regulations - Suppressing Chinese Entry - Guarantee Deposit Increased to 100 Japanese Yen <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, many Chinese who had returned home now intended to return to Shanghai to resume their businesses. In recent months, the number of people traveling from Shanghai to Japan has increased, mostly laborers and those involved in trades like barbering, kimono shops, and restaurants. Several dozen groups have been barred from entry. The Japanese have now gone a step further and issued new regulations to suppress this, which have been implemented since yesterday, making it even more difficult for Chinese to travel to Japan. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Increased Deposit <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In the past, Chinese traveling to Japan, such as those traveling in third class, had to pay a deposit of 30 yuan before departure. If they were denied entry, this amount would be deducted to cover travel expenses. Because the number of Chinese traveling to Japan has increased, and there are deportations and expulsions on nearly every ship, the Japanese Postal Steamship Company sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday stating that, starting on the 25th of this month, regardless of whether Chinese traveling to Japan have passports or certificates, all third-class passengers and those seeking work in Japan must pay an increased deposit of 100 Japanese yen before purchasing a ticket, for which the shipping company will issue a receipt. If they are allowed to land in Japan, they can reclaim the deposit with the receipt. Without this amount, no ticket will be sold.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Shanghai Companies Implement <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Local Japanese shipping companies have already complied with the new regulations and increased the deposit for passengers traveling to Japan. At 10:00 AM yesterday, a group of seven or eight Chinese planning to travel to Kobe and other places in Japan went to a Japanese shipping company to purchase tickets. They each paid the deposit of 30 yuan, but the Japanese shipping company presented the new regulations, requiring them to pay an additional 100 yen. The Chinese passengers did not have such a large amount of money at the time. After repeated negotiations, they were unable to come to an agreement, and they had to leave. The reporter later inquired with these passengers, who stated that they had been recruited by Chinese-owned restaurants, kimono shops, and other businesses in Japan. Their travel expenses had been pieced together with difficulty. They asked where they could get such a large deposit. From now on, Chinese traveling to Japan can only sigh in despair at the vast ocean.</p>

<p>The Special Party Branches of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing: "Greetings to the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing. The nation is facing many difficulties and disasters are occurring one after another. Internal stability is necessary to repel foreign aggression, and unity is necessary for survival. We must work together in the same boat. Unexpectedly, while the military campaign to suppress the communists is progressing daily, the Fujian Incident has suddenly erupted. These rebellious parties are destroying the country and integrating red communists and rebellious parties into a single group of treacherous villains. Such insane and madmen should be abandoned by all Chinese people. To harbor a tumor is to invite disaster, as the ancient saying goes. We must act swiftly and resolutely, and dare to telegraphically request a clear order to denounce and punish them to strengthen the foundation of the country. The future of the party and the nation depends on it." The Executive Committee of the Special Party Branches of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways bows in respect.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Encountered Danger in Zhoushan the Day Before Yesterday - Sikorsky Plane Disassembled and Transported to Shanghai - No One Seriously Injured - Minimal Mail Loss, Currently Being Sorted - Next Shanghai-Guangdong Flight Will Depart as Scheduled <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong flight reported to the Shanghai head office at 8:35 AM on the 24th that the weather was poor and would return to Shanghai. The company speculated that the southbound plane would return to Shanghai after sending the message. Unexpectedly, when the plane was turning north, it hit an island peak due to heavy fog. However, according to many passengers, if it were not for the superb skills and quick thinking of pilot Lumir, the passengers and pilots on the plane would not have survived.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Rescue Situation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After the plane was damaged, pilot Lumir disregarded his own injuries and immediately assisted the passengers in leaving the plane to find a safe place. Together with the local people and the mass forces of the defense team, they chartered a boat to transport the passengers, mail, and luggage back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Flight Schedule Unchanged <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The company's Shanghai-Guangdong route was originally scheduled to run twice a week. The company has decided to maintain the original schedule, and the next southbound flight will depart as scheduled next Tuesday (November 28). Although there is only one Sikorsky plane, there are two spare engines for timely replacement. Therefore, the current situation can still be maintained continuously. The company is also using the Loening amphibian as a backup plane to ensure that the flight schedule is not interrupted by this accident.</p>
<h3 id="e127">New Plane to Fill the Gap <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>For the time being, the company will have a new plane shipped from the United States to fill the gap. In about a few months, the Shanghai-Guangdong route will also purchase newer, faster planes that are faster than the Sikorsky. This will reduce the round trip time between Shanghai and Guangdong to two days, instead of the current three. At that time, the flight schedule will be changed to three times a week. In the spring and summer, the Sikorsky plane can reach Shanghai and Guangdong in two days for a round trip. Currently, it is winter, the days are short, and the northbound plane often encounters northerly headwinds, so the northbound plane cannot reach Shanghai on the same day after taking off from Guangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Next Passengers <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Next month, construction will begin on a larger hangar at Longhua to accommodate the new, fast planes for the Shanghai-Chongqing route. These planes will arrive in Shanghai soon. There will be seven passengers on the southbound Shanghai-Guangdong flight next Tuesday, and two passengers from Guangzhou, two from Shantou, and one from Fuzhou on the northbound flight on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The China National Aviation Corporation hired a small boat from Wheelock, Marden &amp; Co. yesterday to sail to Caiqi Mountain in Haiyan to tow the damaged Sikorsky No. 16 to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Recalling the Accident <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to passengers who witnessed the accident yesterday, the plane took off at 6:05 AM on the 24th and turned back to Shanghai due to fog. It took off again at 8:20 AM. There was no fog within about 20 miles of Longhua Airport, but the clouds were low. Because the clouds were low, the plane could not fly high. Looking down at the sea, the seawater was yellow. After flying forward for about 20 miles, it suddenly encountered fog again, which was also yellow. The sky and the water were the same color. The pilot could not fly forward, so he telegraphed Longhua Airport to say that he would turn back and turned the plane around to return. At that time, the speed of the plane had been reduced from 110 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour. Just as it was turning around, a strange peak suddenly appeared, vaguely visible in the fog, about 270 feet high. It was already too late to avoid it. The pilot raised the nose of the plane and went straight up into the clouds, but he did not rise high enough. The bottom of the plane eventually touched down on the mountainside of Caiqi Mountain. Fortunately, the fuel was shut off, but the plane still rushed forward for about 100 yards before flipping over and stopping. Therefore, everyone suffered minor injuries. If the plane had flipped over as soon as it landed, it would have been unthinkable. The site was about 200 feet above sea level. The plane's wings had been destroyed, the engine was slightly damaged, but the fuselage was undamaged.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Pilot's Experience <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that the pilot Lumir had 5,000 hours of flying experience, so he was able to remove the seaplane wheels and shut off the fuel at the critical moment. Otherwise, the plane would have caught fire, and all nine people on board would have perished.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Injuries of Each Person <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The injured people who were transported from Zhapu twice at 11:00 PM and 1:30 AM the night before were all sent to Hong En Hospital for treatment. The injuries were as follows: (1) Co-pilot Aimar, both ankles were broken, so the injury was the most serious; (2) Lady Keelis (niece of British Minister Lampson), both ankles were broken and there were abrasions; (3) US Consul in Fuzhou, Reynolds, leg injuries and minor abrasions; (4) Xu Bojian of Asiatic Electric Company, leg injury and abrasions; (5) Zhang Shunfan, manager of Fuzhou Motor Company, leg injuries and abrasions; (6) Yang Mingxin, Superintendent of Wenzhou Customs, leg injury; (7) Yang Zhonghe, back injury. The destinations of each person were Yang Mingxin and Yang Zhonghe to Wenzhou, Reynolds, Xu Bojian, and Zhang Shunfan to Fuzhou, and Lady Keelis to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Two People Discharged <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>(1) The injuries of the main pilot Lumir were very minor. He was discharged yesterday after bandaging. (2) The injuries of Skavfer, a German from Kong Si Yanghang, were also minor. He was also discharged yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Mail Loss <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency, the plane carried a total of 33 pounds of mail, including mail for Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Shantou, and other stations.

<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a proclamation yesterday stating, "Landowners rely on property to make a living, and tenant farmers rely on farming for food. They depend on each other for mutual benefit, and they each have the responsibility to pay taxes and rent. There is also a lot of mutual understanding. Although the districts under the county suffered from typhoons this year, the harvest is inevitably shorter. The total harvest is still not too far from the harvest in a good year. Now that it is time to collect rent, we hereby proclaim to the landowners and tenant farmers that they must collect and pay rent as usual for this year. Landowners should not make unreasonable demands, and tenants should not arbitrarily reduce or discount the rent, or listen to rumors, wait and see, and cause trouble, which will lead to investigation. Everyone must abide by this."</p>
<h3 id="e138">At the Border Between the Chinese and Concession Areas - Water and Electricity Problems for Residents in the Chinese Area - Land Bureau Proclaims That Supply Should be Provided by the Chinese Area - Severe Punishment for Illegally Connecting to Concession Water and Electricity <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau proclaimed yesterday, "The Bureau has previously investigated cases where houses located at the border between the Chinese and concession areas, whose addresses are located in the Chinese area, often arbitrarily connect to water and electricity from the concessions, which greatly harms national sovereignty. A measure to ban this was drafted in September of the 18th year of the Republic, stipulating that residents at the border between the Chinese and concession areas whose residences are located entirely in the Chinese area must use water and electricity supplied by the Chinese area. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be ordered to dismantle the connection automatically and will be punished accordingly. If they refuse to comply, the houses will be sealed up. As for houses located at the border between the Chinese and concession areas that straddle both the Chinese and concession areas, residents who want to connect to water and electricity must first report their address and house number to the Bureau. The Bureau will instruct them to connect to water and electricity from which side, and the Bureau will present this measure to the Municipal Government for approval and proclamation to all residents at the border between the Chinese and concession areas. Recently, reports have indicated that residents at the border are still illegally connecting to water and electricity from the concessions, which is inappropriate. Now, in order to strictly enforce administrative orders and safeguard sovereignty, the Bureau, in addition to investigating and punishing residents who illegally connect to water and electricity from the concessions, hereby proclaims to all residents at the border to abide by the previous measure and not to arbitrarily connect to water and electricity from the concessions. This is the proclamation, signed by Director Xu Peihuang."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Zhang Zilian and Others Initiate the Organization of a Domestic Yarn Purchasing Agency - Issue Declaration <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, there has been a consensus across all sectors to resist enemy goods and raw materials. However, for yarn, small cloth factories and knitting factories still purchase them separately. Zhang Zilian and others in the domestic goods sector, seeing this, invited textile tycoons such as Li Rongchu, Rong Moxian, Hu Peng, Dong Quesun, Wang Haoran, and Zheng Haiuo to jointly organize the China Domestic Yarn Purchasing Agency. They leased a three-story building at No. 19, South of Nanjing Road, Guizhou Road, as a business location. They have already signed special contracts with various Chinese yarn mills and have notified cloth factories, knitting factories, towel factories to purchase domestic yarn in the future and not to use enemy goods. It is heard that they will start business today. The agency's declaration states: "The dumping policy is the most poisonous trick that international capitalist countries use on small and weak nations. International capitalist countries know that small and weak nations cannot break free from their shackles in the contradictory economic phenomenon, so they satisfy their desire for high oppression and maintain their own lives. The consistent plan of imperialist Japan's aggression against China is to use the dumping policy as its goal. In order to achieve its poisonous plan, it must break our country's nascent industries, form a larger chaos, and accelerate the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race. The lost land of Liaodong has not been recovered, and the traces of the war in northern Shanghai are still there. Japanese yarn and thread are already invincible in the cotton textile industry. Small-scale cotton textile factories must rely on this to survive. Is this not a hopeless situation? The concept of individual interest dominates their actions, and treacherous merchants take the opportunity to deceive and lure them, disregarding the survival of the entire nation. These economic traitors created by the environment, although their stupidity is unparalleled, their feelings are actually excusable. We have been working in the cotton textile industry for more than ten years and know this situation well. Sitting and talking does not help the facts, only action can be effective. Therefore, we organized the China Domestic Yarn Purchasing Co., Ltd. at the south of Nanjing Road, Guizhou Road in Shanghai, concentrating all domestic yarn, offering the lowest prices, and striving to promote sales, so that goods have a destination, and treacherous people cannot mix fish eyes with pearls to achieve their deceitful and profitable schemes. Where justice lies, we will devote all our efforts to ensure that cotton textile factories use domestic yarn as much as possible, so that our country's textile industry will not be oppressed by the dumping strategy of Japanese imperialism and be on the verge of bankruptcy. Cotton textile factories can use pure domestic raw materials to create finished products for the people's needs, leaving a glimmer of hope for the national economy, so that we can get respite and restore. Furthermore, we will urge textile factories to improve their products and improve their economic organization, so that the economic relationship with cotton textile factories is coordinated and closely linked, and we will fight Japanese imperialism in the economic market. We know that our efforts are weak and we dare not be complacent. We swear to be sincere, work hard, and fight. Gentlemen of the nation, we hope that you will guide us forward. This is our declaration. We hope you will consider it."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Community Association and the First District Citizens' Association have recently received a letter from Sanyou Industrial Society requesting assistance in the labor-capital dispute at the factory. They have held regular meetings and joint meetings of the two associations to discuss assistance measures. In addition to jointly sending telegrams with the Mechanics Association and others to the Capital Government, they have also decided to organize a special committee to assist, consisting of three standing committee members, two executive members, and four legal advisors. They also sent separate letters to the Shanghai First Special District Court and the Shanghai Local Court. The content is similar to the facts stated in the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the court, which has been reported in the newspapers. One point is that "Sanyou Society is one of the few national industries created with more than ten years of hard work. If it goes bankrupt due to acquiescing to the unreasonable demands of a small number of workers, the victims will not only be Sanyou Society. If such a bad example of labor-capital dismissal is set, the consequences for all domestic factories will be unimaginable. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. If the rabbit dies, the fox will grieve. This is why our association cannot be without concern. The law is designed to protect the people, resolve disputes, and balance the situation. In addition to representatives attending and listening to the next hearing, our association dares to first send a letter requesting your court to request all case files from the Shanghai Local Court and handle them carefully according to the law." It is also heard that the First District Court has scheduled the Sanyou Society incident to be heard in the Twelfth Court at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. The two associations have notified all members to attend and listen to the hearing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Association, considering Shanghai as the hub of East Asian transportation and that the success or failure of various undertakings is related to the whole country and the world, hired experts last October. After ten months of effort, they compiled the Shanghai Municipal Statistics. The contents are divided into sixteen categories: land, population, administration, justice, finance, banking, commerce, industry, labor, agriculture, transportation, public utilities, cultural undertakings, education, society, and hygiene. There are four hundred tables. Most of the materials were collected from public, private, Chinese, and foreign organizations and private individuals in the city, and some were obtained through on-site investigations. The data mainly pertains to 1932, with past materials covering the most recent three years, and some extending back more than ten years. Statistical experts, including Mr. Liu Dajun, Mr. Cai Zhengya, Mr. Zhang Xinyi, and Mr. Wu Zelin, provided guidance and design. Each category had several experts who carefully reviewed the data. Finally, Mr. Cai Zhengya conducted a final review. Therefore, the content is rich, the compilation is novel, the figures are accurate, and the printing is excellent. It can be used as a reference for legislation, administration, study, writing, and domestic and foreign trade, meeting various needs. Recognizing that Shanghai is a global metropolis attracting worldwide attention and that many foreigners desire to understand Shanghai's true situation, the association specially published the book in a Chinese-English bilingual format. The entire book contains more than four hundred pages and is bound into a large volume. It was published on the 25th. It is said that the association aims to serve society, and the price is very low: the paperback version costs silver $2.85, plus postage of $0.30; the hardcover version costs silver $3.85, plus postage of $0.30; and the hardcover international edition costs US$1.80, postage included. During the pre-publication reservation period, nearly a thousand copies were ordered from home and abroad.

<h3 id="e144">Meeting Notes of the Yangzhong Native Place Industry and Commerce Association in Shanghai - Discussion of Ways to Deal with Land Tax <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Yangzhong Native Place Industry and Commerce Association in Shanghai, due to the Yangzhong County government's forced collection of land taxes on the 22nd of this month, which aroused public outrage and led to a major tragedy, convened a general meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss solutions. Chen Xiaoshan was elected chairman. The chairman first reported that the county is small, the people are poor, and the taxes are heavy. In recent years, disasters and crop failures have been frequent, and the rural areas are almost bankrupt. The people are struggling to survive and unanimously requested the county government to reduce land tax surcharges to allow them to survive. Because the surcharges exceed the regular tax by more than four times, the people cannot bear the burden. Recently, after the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance of the National Government, and Jiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Council, successively issued telegrams to provinces and counties strictly prohibiting surcharges from exceeding the regular tax, the people's movement to reduce taxes became more concrete. However, the county government disregarded the regulations and the people's difficulties, insisting on forced collection, which aroused unrest and resulted in the loss of lives. "We are all connected and should express ourselves." Next, Zhang Tinggan, a representative of the people of the county who came to Shanghai to appeal, reported the truth of the incident and requested assistance. After discussion, the following was resolved: (1) County Magistrate Feng Peisan acted rashly and killed civilians, and a telegram should be sent to the National Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to remove him from his post and investigate him thoroughly. (2) Representatives should be elected to petition the National Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government. (3) Representatives should be elected to return to Yangzhong to investigate the truth of the incident. (4) The public should be advised to wait quietly for a solution and not to riot. (5) County Magistrate Feng Peisan should be warned to act prudently and not to continue to act arbitrarily. (6) The media should be requested to uphold justice. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Two Monks Actually Attempted Extortion - Monks Also Engage in Illegal Activities - Buddhist Scoundrels Commit a Truly Grave Sin <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Rong Gengyuan, who resides at No. 24 Xiude Lane, Baike Road, works as a deputy buyer at the Kelai Zhen Cotton Yarn firm on Jiangxi Road. On the 19th of this month, Rong suddenly received a letter by mail. Upon opening it, the words inside were threatening and intended to extort five thousand silver dollars. It also instructed that the money be wrapped in old paper and sent to the trash can opposite the Chongfa Temple in Xisheng Lane on Gulou Road at 8 PM on the 20th, where someone would come to collect it. After receiving the letter, Rong reported it to the Xin Zha police station. Detective Yao Yuanlong, detectives Ruan Yao and Cui Shunke, and patrolmen Ye Yushan, Xia Yeshan, and Zong Weiting were dispatched to secretly guard the area around the lane. Before long, a monk was seen walking out of the Chongfa Temple on the opposite side. He went to the entrance of Xisheng Lane and looked at the trash can for a long time. He seemed to notice that there was nothing in the can, so he turned back to the temple. At that time, the detectives did not take any action because the monk did not make any move. The next day, Rong received a second threatening letter with even more intense language. It accused Rong of not following the instructions in the letter and warned that if he continued to disobey, appropriate measures would be taken. It also demanded that the money be sent to the front of Dr. Zhu Shaobo's office in Xisheng Lane the night before. Rong reported to the police again, and the same group of Chinese and foreign detectives was dispatched to lie in ambush at that location. At around 9 PM, the monk De Kuan (from Dongtai, Jiangbei, 27 years old) from the Chongfa Temple on the opposite side arrived. He first peered around suspiciously. Seeing that no one was there, he went straight to pick up a paper package that Rong had prepared and turned to flee. He was arrested by the detectives who stepped forward. At that moment, Wang Genrong was passing by the entrance of Xisheng Lane on Gulou Road, carrying a waste paper basket. The monk threw the paper package into the waste paper basket and was apprehended by the detectives. He was taken to the police station. Under questioning, De Kuan initially denied the charges, but later confessed that he had discussed the matter with the monk Anqing from the Chongfa Temple and that the draft was also written by Anqing. Chinese and foreign detectives immediately went to the Chongfa Temple and arrested Anqing. Several notes were found in De Kuan's room. These notes were compared with the threatening letter received by Rong, and the handwriting was found to be identical. They were ordered to be detained and were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the facts of the case, saying that since the defendant's arrest, Rong Gengyuan had received another threatening letter. However, the police station had determined that the letter was mailed by the defendant De Kuan before his arrest. All the letters have been sent to the General Police Station and are being checked for handwriting, so they have not yet been submitted to the court. He requested a postponement to continue the investigation. Then, the witnesses Wang Genrong and Li He, a night watchman in Xisheng Lane, testified that they witnessed De Kuan picking up the paper package last night and throwing it into the waste paper basket upon seeing the detectives. De Kuan's statement was evasive, and Anqing also denied the charges, saying, "I have been a monk in Chongfa Temple for several years. De Kuan only arrived at the temple three or four months ago. We have no contact on weekdays. I know nothing about writing threatening letters." Judge Xue reviewed the confession and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody separately for further interrogation on the 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Exploiting Children to Steal - Case Solved in Datong Sock Factory - Attention Should Be Paid to Abetting Masterminds <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a class of rogue thieves has been discovered in the city who have had a unique idea of using copper coins, candy, food, etc. to entice ignorant children, mixing them into various shops, and using them to steal when people are unprepared. All stolen items are taken away by these people to be used. Because the shops are crowded with customers during business hours, they do not pay attention to these children, thinking they are brought by customers. As a result, many people have been victimized, and these thieves exploit children to steal. If they are exposed, they flee without a trace, making it difficult for the authorities to solve the cases. At around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, while business was bustling at the Datong Sock Factory at No. 49 Fangbang Road in the east of the city, two girls with bulging abdomens and panicked expressions were about to sneak out of the factory when they were discovered by factory workers, including Mei Zhiyou from Nanjing, who suspected their behavior. He immediately ordered them to stop and searched them, discovering two large skeins of wool yarn hidden in their clothes, causing their abdomens to bulge. At this point, Mei and others realized that the two girls were petty thieves and went outside to call for the police officer Wei Lianqing on duty. The two girls and the stolen goods were taken to the Second Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation by Chief Liu, Mei explained the situation, saying that various items had been stolen from the factory by children recently. He requested a thorough investigation. One girl confessed her name was Wang Mei, about eight years old, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 2 Tongfu Lane, Pudong. The other confessed her name was Gao Lanxiang, nine years old, also from Jiangbei, residing at No. 1 Hede Lane, Lan Mudu. They both stated that two men from Jiangbei had first used a lot of food to trick them into going to Puxi, then took them to the entrance of the Datong Sock Factory and forced them to go inside and steal the wool yarn placed on the counter. They had no choice but to go inside and, fortunately, were not noticed by the people in the factory. After stealing the wool yarn, they hid it on their bodies and were about to leave the factory when they were discovered and arrested by the people in the factory. The men who were standing outside the door monitoring their theft took the opportunity to flee. While confessing, the two girls cried and spoke in extreme remorse. They were ordered to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Hainan Sugar Representatives Make Another Appeal - Second Petition <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Since the Qiongzhou and Jiujiang Customs detained Hainan native sugar, public sentiment has been greatly angered. Merchants and farmers in various counties have gathered to question the customs officer of Qiongzhou Customs. The local government, in view of this, has on the one hand advised the farmers to wait quietly for handling, and on the other hand responded to the request of the Haikou Chamber of Commerce by sending representatives to attend and try to maintain the situation, and sent representative Xing Juefei to Beijing to petition. The previous report has been repeatedly reported. Here is an excerpt of the representative's second petition to the Executive Yuan: "Presenting a petition to request that the Ministries of Finance and Industry be ordered to resolve the Hainan sugar case as soon as possible to comfort public opinion and relieve the suffering. The native sugar from Qiongya has been coming north without incident. However, since Zhou Li came to Qiongzhou this year to serve as the Customs Officer, he has detained the native sugar out of order, falsely claiming that foreign sugar is mixed in, treating it the same as deer and horses, confiscating and punishing it arbitrarily, doing so once and again, without any physical evidence or legal basis. Its impact on the market and destruction of the rural areas is unprecedented. As a result, more than 100,000 merchants and farmers who produce and sell sugar have been plunged into deep water and fire. All the facts of the matter have been submitted to your review. We have been informed that the Ministries of Finance and Industry have been instructed to jointly investigate and handle the matter. However, a month has passed, and the Ministries of Finance and Industry have not yet seen any solution or guarantee order, causing merchants and farmers to suffer injustice and hardship, and to live day by day without food or clothing. How can they survive this severe winter? The people come from the people and have witnessed the misery and uproar of the people, which cannot be postponed. Fortunately, the authorities in Qiongya have repeatedly comforted them, waiting quietly for the central government to resolve the matter and ensure the safety of our merchants and farmers. Now, the delay in resolving the matter is causing disappointment among the people. The people look back at their hometown, and the interests are deeply felt. Therefore, we do not hesitate to express our views and plead for the people, not avoiding punishment. We humbly beg the President to have mercy on the merchants and farmers, and immediately order the convening of the Ministries of Finance and Industry, sending personnel to the Yuan to jointly discuss a proper protection method, redress all wrongful cases to relieve the difficulties of the merchants and relieve the suffering of the people. Not only will the people alone remember the great virtue, but also more than 100,000 farmers and merchants in Qiongya will eternally remember the great kindness of recovery. We have exhausted our words and are eagerly awaiting orders."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Wusong Telephone Malfunction: Municipal Office Sends Letter Requesting Improvement <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The telephone service in Wusong District was previously operated by the private Songyang Telephone Company before the war. However, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the entire company was destroyed, making it impossible to recover. It was then taken over by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. Now that the market has returned to normal, the number of telephone subscribers is increasing daily. However, the telephones are of poor quality and communication is slow, causing complaints from users. When trying to connect to Shanghai, due to limited lines, users must wait a long time, sometimes even an hour without getting through. At times, the sound is too weak to understand. Tang Chengzong, a Wusong Municipal Committee member, believes that the installation of telephones is not only for quick communication of information but also related to social security. If they are ineffective when needed, the impact would be significant. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, requesting that five pairs of Songhu telephone lines be added and that all old and damaged telephones be replaced within the shortest possible time, in order to ensure smooth communication and develop the market.</p>

<p>The Family Industrial Cooperative, manufacturer of the nationally renowned Invincible brand toothpaste and tooth powder, recently noted the lack of attention paid to children's dental health in the country, which directly affects their physical development. To draw the attention of the general public, they have specially invited Dr. Su Jielang, Director of the Dental Department of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, to organize a relatively large-scale children's dental clinic at the Invincible brand distribution center on Nanjing Road. Since its inception, progress has been made, and the necessary materials and machinery have been manufactured by the cooperative based on modern, world-class dental equipment. Most of the equipment has now been installed. Yesterday was the day for the trainee entrance examination. All applicants arrived at the cooperative on time to take the examination, which was supervised by Dr. Gu Hailing, a dental doctor who studied in Germany, with the assistance of Doctors Tang Jiazhen and Tan Xingzhong, who examined the physical condition of each candidate. As a result, Sheng Zhiqing, Zou Fengying, and He Wenyu were admitted, and Ye Yunying was selected as an alternate. It is reported that the clinic will open in early next month, with exceptionally low fees.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Shops on Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, Burglarized Simultaneously; Tobacco and Paper Shop and Restaurant Suffer Significant Losses; Employee's Wages Also Stolen <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>At 1485 Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai, a double-fronted building houses the He Xing tobacco, paper, and sundry goods shop operated by Cao Yongming on the west side, and a small restaurant operated by Tang Hanru on the east side. They have been in business for many years, with reasonably good trade, attracting the attention of thieves. At 9:15 pm the night before last, six robbers, carrying three handguns, first went to the restaurant, pretending to have dinner. Then, three robbers entered and closed the front door tightly. They pulled out handguns and threatened the seven people from both shops, placing them under surveillance. Two robbers stood guard, while two others went upstairs and forced their way into the bedroom, ransacking it. As a result, the tobacco and paper shop was robbed of 57 silver dollars, 255 paper dollars, and 457 small coins. The restaurant was robbed of 35 paper dollars, one silver dollar, and a lined spring jacket and trousers, as well as a silk gauze shirt and trousers. When the robbers fled with the stolen goods, they also snatched more than 30 dollars in wages from Zhou Zhongfu, an employee of the tobacco shop. Upon learning of this, Tang Bingxiang, the detective squad leader of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led detectives Sun Shucheng and Yang Zhongjin, along with police officers, to pursue and apprehend the robbers. However, the robbers had already fled without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Trial Opens for Appeal in the Shao Wenbin Assassination Case <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Shao Wenbin, the deceased "King of Flower Gambling," nicknamed "Ma Fu A Liu," originally worked as a Tanhuang singer and later switched to running flower gambling houses. He lived at No. 19 Zhilan Lane, Kazei Road, in the French Concession. Because the French Concession police authorities strictly cracked down on flower gambling, he could not stay there and moved to the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. Due to deep-seated grudges with others in the flower gambling business, at approximately 8:00 pm on July 28th of this year, he was returning home from dinner at the Far East Hotel when he was suddenly ambushed and shot dead by a gang of enemies in front of No. 210 Huage Nie Road in the French Concession. At the same time, the murderer Li Sigen fled to the intersection of Edward Road and Longmen Road, where he resisted arrest by shooting at the detectives who were pursuing him. He was shot and killed by the detectives. After the incident, on the evening of September 14th, the special operations director of the French Concession Police Department, Jin Jiulin, along with patrol detectives and Chinese and foreign detectives from the Zhabei Police Station of the Public Concession, arrested the murderer Zhang Bingrong, a Ningbo native (31 years old, nicknamed "Little Ningbo," formerly a painter), at No. 68 Hongfu Lane, Xin Zha Road. He was interrogated by the Second Special District Court and sentenced on the 23rd of last month to 15 years of imprisonment for joint murder, as previously reported. It is now learned that Zhang has appealed the original sentence to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court has completed the investigation court hearing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, the presiding judge Guo Dezhang, along with assessors Fan and Sun, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, specially convened a collegial panel to hear the case. According to the appellant Zhang Bingrong, he completely overturned all the points he had confessed to in the original trial, denying that he had gone to commit murder, and stated that he only knew the details of the matter, which was initiated by four others, who invited the deceased Li Sigen and the fugitives Chen Changgen, Li Landi, and Wang Shilong to go together. Li Landi was invited by Wang. He claimed that he was suffering from a fish-mouth sore, and on the night of the incident, he was sleeping in the Lixing Inn at Chujiaqiao and did not go there at all. He also claimed that he had served four years in prison for a theft case in the British Concession and had not been released for long, so he would not dare to commit murder again. He pleaded that he had been wrongly arrested and requested an investigation and redress. The court verified the confession and announced that it would be adjourned for further investigation. The appellant was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Thieves Arrested, Firearms Confiscated <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 22nd of this month, the home of Wang Yongsheng at No. 212 Baker Road was burgled of clothing and other items worth approximately 30 dollars. The incident was reported to the Zhabei Police Station. During the investigation, Wang suspected that Shao Xingsheng (also known as Yin Yuyao), a Ningbo native with whom he had a past dispute, was heavily involved. Yesterday afternoon at 6:15 pm, Chinese Detective Li Shizhong, Detective Leader Tao Rubi, and Bao Detective Ji Binkui went to investigate Shao's residence in the pavilion room at No. 25 Hongfu Lane, Changsha Road. When the detectives arrived, they saw five people sitting in a circle talking, three on the ground and two on the bed. Suspecting that they were robbers, the detectives drew their guns and ordered the five men not to move. At the same time, they telegraphed the police station for reinforcements. The five men were arrested, and a handgun, 100 bullets, a wooden fake handgun, a leather fake handgun, a children's toy handgun, two fake pearl flowers, a pair of pliers, two pawn tickets were confiscated from the room, including under the bed. They were taken back to the police station. Under questioning, the five men were identified as Hu Amao, Li Bingquan, Shao Xingsheng, Chang Aliang, and Xu Xiaobao, all from Ningbo. After investigation, Lu was found to be unrelated and was released immediately. It was also learned that an accomplice, Wu Chenggang, was hiding at No. 54 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road. Wu possessed four handguns, which were hidden in the ceiling above the electric light and could only be retrieved by removing the electric light. The detectives then went to arrest him, but Wu had already fled upon hearing the news. The detectives removed the large electric light in the room and found a hole in the ceiling, but the handguns were gone, presumably taken by Wu. They then returned to the police station. Yesterday morning, Hu Amao and the other three were taken to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement for further investigation. When questioned, the defendants all confessed to robbing the residents of two locations on Baoding Road and Huaji Road. Hu Amao wielded the gun, and Chang Aliang acted as a lookout. Judge Xue Lanru verified the confessions and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Private Flower Gambling Operation Convicted <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Xie Guangming, the chief detective, and Hang Bingquan, the deputy detective, of the gambling squad of the French Concession Police Department, learned that someone had privately set up a large flower gambling operation in a house at No. 1 Song Deli, Julai Da Road, collecting gambling money day and night, amounting to several thousand dollars. At 0:05 pm on the 18th of this month, they, along with Western detectives and patrol detectives, rushed to search and arrest the suspects. They arrested on the spot Jin Hesheng, the owner of the operation, and employees Liu Shugen, Shen Alai, Hua Amao, and Gu Gengen. They confiscated dozens of flower gambling slips, hundreds of dollars in gambling money, and ledgers, along with seventeen gamblers, including Liu Gansheng, Zhou Baoyuan, Shen Afu, Feng Jun, Yang Rongxi, Mao Fusheng, Pu Heshang, Zhou Jifu, Shi Minggen, Zhu Qingyao, Gao Zhongtang, and Shi Jiasong. They were taken to the police station and transferred to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The case has been concluded after interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanxing presided over the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought before the court. Jin Hesheng was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and fined 500 dollars. Liu Shugen and Shen Alai were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment and fined 300 dollars. Hua Amao was sentenced to three months of imprisonment and fined 60 dollars. Gu Gengen was sentenced to two months of imprisonment and fined 40 dollars. If the fines were converted into imprisonment, they would be calculated at a rate of three dollars per day. The number of days of pre-trial detention would be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment or one day for three dollars of the fine. The twelve gamblers, including Liu Gansheng, were each fined ten dollars, which could be converted into imprisonment at a rate of one dollar per day. The gambling tools and gambling money were confiscated according to the list.</p>

<p>Xu Cai's daughter, Genda, 19 years old, who lives at No. 15 Kunming Road, is of local ethnicity, somewhat attractive, and unmarried. She works as a female worker at the Shanghai Third Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. At 6:00 pm on September 16th, after finishing work at the mill, she disappeared and did not return. Her mother, Xu Cai, asked people to search everywhere, but there was no news. Xu reported the matter to the police station for assistance in finding her, but without success. On the morning of the 28th of that month, Shen Jinkui, a 22-year-old oiling machine mechanic from Yangzhou in the same workshop, told Xu Jinfeng, Genda's cousin, that Genda was living with him at No. 41 Songpan Lane, Songpan Road. He said that she now wanted to go home and that she would be at Dalianwan Road the next morning, and her mother could come to take her back. Xu Jinfeng was overjoyed and immediately informed her widowed mother, Xu Cai, who arrived at the road on time and waited for a long time, but did not see any trace of Genda. Xu returned disappointed. Thinking that her daughter had been seduced and deflowered by Shen, there was nothing she could do. Unwilling to wash dirty linen in public, she thought that her daughter would return home soon, and she would deal with it then. However, until the 3rd of this month, Genda suddenly returned home. Xu only had this one daughter, so she only reprimanded her slightly. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 am the next morning, Shen and three friends lingered outside the girl's house before leaving. Two hours later, Genda disappeared again. Xu Cai knew that she had gone to Shen's place and let it go. The morning before yesterday, at 8:00 am, Shen Jinkui brought a pair of the girl's trousers to Xu's house, saying that Genda was not at his place. He said that she had claimed to be returning home for several days, so he was returning her clothes. Xu Cai was shocked because her daughter had not returned home, and was in fact being hidden elsewhere, or there might be an accident. She immediately took Shen to Chinese Detective Huang Fugen and brought him to the Huishan Police Station, ordering him to hand over her daughter. The police chief ordered him to be taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case. Then, Xu Jinfeng, the niece of the plaintiff Xu Cai, testified about what happened. When questioned, the defendant insisted that since his late wife had passed away, he and Genda had fallen in love. On the night of September 16th, Genda came to his house of her own accord, willing to stay with him as his wife. He then asked a matchmaker to negotiate, but the matter of the bride price had not yet been resolved. He claimed that he did not know where Genda was now and had not hidden her. He asked for a judgment. Judge Wu Zehan ordered him to be returned to custody for further verification at a later date.</p>

<p>At the Spuncrete Co. cement factory, owned by Western merchants, at No. 1087, intersection of Dongyouheng Road and Alcock Road, there are fifty or sixty male workers. Yesterday afternoon at 4:50 pm, a part of the machinery in the engine room suddenly broke down, injuring two workers on the spot. One was Zhang Qingsheng, 37 years old, from Jiangbei, who was injured in the abdomen and hands. The other was Zhang Damao, who was hit in the head, and his condition was serious. Both were taken to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Zhang Qingsheng's injuries were minor, and he was discharged from the hospital after being examined by a doctor.</p>

<p>Yang Wenbin, 36 years old, from Haimen, rents a flat at a certain house at the end of Baotong Road, Yanjiajiao, in Zhabei. He is a tea room worker at the East Asia Construction Company at No. 22 Yuanmingyuan Road. Chen Songlin, a rickshaw puller who lives with him, borrowed ten dollars from Yang a month ago, which has not yet been repaid. Yesterday morning at around 7:00 am, Yang needed the money urgently and asked Chen to repay the debt. At that time, Chen was drinking alone. Chen, who was deeply superstitious, became furious, saying that Yang should not ask for money so early in the morning, which led to an argument. Chen then used a knife to stab Yang six or seven times in the head and left hand, causing severe bleeding. Neighbors heard the commotion and called the police, who arrested the assailant and took him to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for investigation. The injured man was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Municipal Farmers' Association Presents to the Ministry of Industry: Requesting Order for Paper Merchants to Purchase Marshmallow <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association yesterday telegraphed a letter to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Regarding the request to order paper manufacturing companies to purchase marshmallow and save the livelihood of farmers: Recently, rice, wheat, and cotton have suffered successive years of poor harvests, and prices have fallen. Coincidentally, the paper industry in this city, believing that agricultural production was depressed, sought to remedy agriculture and paper-making raw materials from agricultural produce. They encouraged the planting of marshmallow and issued leaflets, advising farmers to plant it. In the past one or two years, some farmers in this city have planted it, and in the neighboring counties of Chuansha and Nanhui in Jiangsu Province, after promotion, many have sown marshmallow and made considerable profits. Unexpectedly, after the autumn harvest this year, when farmers came to Shanghai to sell their crops, they were suddenly rejected by paper mills. The livelihood of farmers has been greatly affected. When rice, wheat, and cotton were the main agricultural products in the past, even if prices were low, they could still be sold cheaply. Now, they are not even available at low prices. How can farmers make a living? They will inevitably become displaced. Moreover, this autumn's wind and rain have caused disasters, and the coastal areas of Chuannan have suffered greatly. After the disaster, the suffering people have goods that are abandoned on the ground. How can they endure it? The Association believes that this matter concerns the livelihood of farmers and has specially prepared this document to present to your Ministry, requesting that the paper manufacturing companies in Shanghai be ordered to purchase marshmallow, or that the disaster relief association in Chuannan be ordered to allocate funds for storage, in order to relieve the farmers. It is hoped that the request will be approved. This would be a great act of kindness. Respectfully submitted to Chen, Minister of Industry, by the Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association."</p>

<p>Since the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company in the Public Concession implemented the new water meter system, there has been little dispute regarding water fees in the central district. Because real estate is expensive and rents are high in the central district, the water fees calculated based on rent under the previous 7.5 system are not significantly different. Therefore, there is no conflict between the owners and the water company. However, the eastern district has been affected by the Shanghai War, commerce has declined, and rents are low. Moreover, this area is a residential area for workers. The rent for each house is less than 50% of that in the central district, and a single house often houses as many as seven or eight families. Therefore, water consumption is higher than in any other area. Previously, water fees were calculated using the 7.5 system, but now the fees are charged based on the water meter system, with differences ranging from six or seven times to more than ten times. Often, the rent collected by the owners is not enough to pay the water bill, and the residents are unwilling to bear the additional water fees. The water company is also unwilling to compromise, so water cut-off disputes occur from time to time, and the three parties are at odds, making it impossible to resolve the issue. Owners, believing that this stalemate is not beneficial to the citizens, have asked the Real Estate Association to suggest to the Municipal Council that a Water Fee Mediation Committee be organized, with the Municipal Council, the Waterworks Company, and the Real Estate Association making impartial judgments according to the law. Although the Municipal Council has agreed to establish such a committee, its establishment has been delayed to this day. The Municipal Council believes that after the establishment of this committee, there will be many requests for adjudication of water fee disputes, and to avoid trouble, they are deliberately delaying the process. The Real Estate Association has repeatedly sent people to urge the establishment of the committee, but the Municipal Council has not given a concrete response. In order to protect the safety of tenants and seek a permanent solution, various neighborhoods are planning to drill artesian wells.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Wusong: Municipal Ferry Terminal Nears Completion <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works is building a municipal ferry terminal on the eastern Bund of Wusong, which is being contracted by the Shanghai Xinzongji Construction Company. Since construction began several months ago, approximately 80-90% of the project has been completed. Recently, wooden planks have been laid, and the project will soon be completed. Therefore, the opening date of the municipal ferry running between Wusong and Shanghai should not be far off. It is reported that the municipal government, in order to revitalize Wusong and the downtown area, has sent letters to Dada Company and others, consulting them to require all ships sailing to Chongming and Jiangbei Nantong to dock at the Wusong ferry terminal for passengers to embark and disembark, to avoid the dangers of small sampans. Cargo can also be loaded and unloaded at the terminal, which is more convenient. After receiving the letter, Dada Company specially commissioned shipowner Lu Genrong to inspect the new terminal under construction in Wusong the day before yesterday. After the inspection, Shipowner Lu said that although the terminal is strong, it is not large, resulting in a small load capacity. Only ships with a capacity of more than five tons can dock there. For large ships, such as Dada's Dalong and Dalun, the terminal needs to have the capacity to withstand a weight of 20 tons before they can dock.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Each Station Should Be Careful: Use Red and White Route Token Bags to Maintain Traffic Safety: Road Bureau Notifies All Stations <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration stated that according to the method for using red and white route token bags at each station, white route token bags should be used for trains that do not have other trains meeting at the advancing station, and red route token bags should be used for trains that must meet other trains at the advancing station. This was previously stipulated and ordered to be followed by the Transportation Department. The purpose of using red route token bags is to allow the train drivers to pay attention in advance before entering the station to prevent traffic accidents. Now that the ferry is operating, all vehicles crossing the river on each route do not have wind brake equipment, so it is not easy to stop trains carrying these vehicles. Therefore, it is even easier for accidents to occur when meeting at the advancing station if precautions are not taken in advance. Fearing that the stations will become lax over time, the Transportation Department has sent a circular to all station masters, stating that they must strictly adhere to the previous orders regarding the use of red and white route token bags and use them carefully to maintain traffic safety. If there is a shortage of these route token bags, they should be requested at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Pudong: Bandits Abound in Bailianjing, Ships Repeatedly Robbed <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>From the mouth of the Bailianjing River in Pudong to Liuli Bridge, factories and houses line the banks and are still relatively bustling. Further into the section of Wuniu, about a mile east of Yanjia Bridge, there are almost no houses on either bank, which has always been desolate. Inland ships only have the sound of oars or ballads at night. Recently, bandits have been driving a boat, anchored there, holding a box cannon and looking like smugglers. When they see a passenger ship passing by, they shout and order it to be inspected, boarding the ship to rob it. On the 31st of last month, the Meng Zhengshan ship of Tai Zhi Bridge in Nanhui was robbed of more than 200 dollars. On the early tide of the 20th of this month, the Zhang Lanmei ship of Jiangjia Road was robbed of more than 170 dollars. The Xiao Amao ship of Chuansha was robbed of two silver dollars and 4,000 copper coins. A single family's ship was robbed of cotton quilts and other items. The Tang Ashui ship of Heqing was robbed of 250 dollars. It is said that when the bandits' boat enters the port, only one person initially rows the boat, no different from an ordinary boat. The remaining bandits walk on the shore until they gather at that location to guard against the investigation of local land and water police and to facilitate escape. It is reported that the shipowners have elected representatives to the Pudong Association of Fellow Villagers, asking the Municipal Public Security Bureau to quickly order the responsible police to arrest the bandits and ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Tobacco and Candy Colleagues Appeal for Relief from the Guild <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Due to the harassment of investigations by the tobacco and alcohol tax authorities, more than 30 tobacco and candy businesses in the South Shanghai area and Pudong jointly elected Mi Chuxin, Guo Jingshun, Chen Heting, and other representatives. Yesterday, they sent separate letters to the South Shanghai Office and Chen Liangyu, Chairman of the Guild, appealing for assistance in relief measures. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, recently, counterfeit cigarettes and miscellaneous cigars have re-emerged in the market. Colleagues who are unaware are often fooled, resulting in fines, ranging from hundreds of dollars to tens of dollars. The number of people fined is countless. The colleagues work hard for 14 hours a day to make a small profit to support their families, which is already difficult. This unexpected disaster, although deserved, should be pitied. Now, the commercial decline has led to many unemployed in society. Those who have little savings often set up a small tobacco and candy shop to make a living, because this type of business is simple and convenient. Therefore, the establishment of tobacco and candy shops has increased like bamboo shoots after a rain, becoming increasingly prevalent. However, they do not have sufficient knowledge of tobacco and candy, which has led to this error. Not only are there counterfeit cigarettes, but also harassment from tobacco license taxes. The most important thing at present is the impact of the decline in steel yuan, as well as the competition among businesses, leading to price cuts, even to the point where there is no profit to be made, resulting in losses. If this continues, the colleagues themselves will be in danger. If you ask any colleague, they will shake their heads and frown, expressing their infinite pain. As the 'Little Reporter' said, 'The humble voices of the common people will of course not be heard by the high and mighty ears.' These words are truly painful. To whom can we, the tobacco and candy colleagues, turn to for our hidden pain? If we do not seek help from ourselves, but seek help from others, what is the point? It is believed that the purpose of the establishment of the guild is to maintain and enhance the common interests of the colleagues and to correct the malpractices of the business. Now that the guild has been established for several years, the directors and supervisors are all outstanding members of the industry. They must know the pain of their own bodies, but why have they not been heard to have made any contributions to the colleagues? It is truly regrettable. The articles of association and the industry regulations are also equal to written documents, waste paper. Is it that the things cannot be done, or are they not willing to do them? However, the colleagues hope that they will discuss the methods of maintaining the business from declining, increasing their knowledge of the business to prevent being deceived by fake cigarettes, alleviating the harassment of license taxes, and correcting the competition of price cuts and cheap sales, just like longing for clouds in a severe drought. If they are slow to act, they will be held accountable for the responsibilities entrusted to them by the colleagues. The members witness this situation and are distressed. Therefore, we make these suggestions to the directors, hoping that they will take action to plan and relieve the colleagues from their suffering. We are extremely grateful and pray for success."</p>
<h3 id="e177">Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory Held Shareholders Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday, Chen Guangfu, Zhao Shuyong, and Others Elected; Jiangsu Provincial Government Appoints Official Shareholder Directors <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Textile Factory convened its 35th shareholders meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Association yesterday at 4 PM. Shareholders present included Hong Lanfan, Wu Yunliang, Cheng Botang, Wu Cheng, and Chen Guangfu, totaling 147 households, representing a share capital of 2,013,250 taels of silver, equivalent to 40,365 shares and 7,235 voting rights. Zhang Xiaoruo was publicly elected as chairman. After formal procedures, the chairman delivered a report, stating briefly that the factory's operational guidelines and reform plans had been reported in detail in the previous session. During this operating period, the country was facing its most severe national crisis. The flames of war raged, and the people suffered greatly, leading to a gradual decline in market prices. Business was sluggish. By the turn of winter and spring, the war in North China had reignited, further hindering sales. At that time, Shanghai alone had an accumulation of over 100,000 bales of yarn and more than 3 million bolts of cloth. After discussions among industry peers, it was decided to suspend work and reduce spinning to provide some relief. However, this did not address the root cause. The price of raw cotton, driven by urgent factory needs, conversely increased, raising costs and leading to greater losses. Japanese factories, with large quantities of finished goods, disregarded costs and dumped goods on our market at reduced prices, putting significant pressure on Chinese factories. Textile businesses in various regions were suspending operations or going bankrupt one after another. Our factory, amidst these turbulent waves, acted prudently and cautiously. We spun and sold yarn and cloth as we produced them, fortunately avoiding stockpiling. In June, while seeking to reorganize operations, we unfortunately experienced a labor strike, which lasted for over a month before it was resolved. There were some inevitable losses at that time, but the factory would not have incurred a loss otherwise. However, considering the subsequent improvement of operations, the savings were substantial. Weighing the gains and losses, it may not have been a misfortune. However, to consolidate the factory's foundation, this session allocated 170,000 yuan from the remaining American cotton surplus from the previous session to the power plant fund. Additionally, over 160,000 yuan was allocated monthly to enhance machinery and buildings. The two items totaled over 330,000 yuan. In reality, there was still a surplus. This can be considered a great fortune. This is the general situation of this session. In addition, to improve cotton cultivation, we specially hired experts this year to promote cultivation in the salt reclamation areas. The autumn harvest was bountiful, and the benefits were already evident. In the future, we plan to continue our efforts, hoping that in three to five years, Jiangbei can produce a large quantity of fine lint raw cotton, achieving self-sufficiency and avoiding reliance on foreigners. The power plant project is also progressing step by step according to the planned schedule. Motors and boilers are being delivered one after another. It is expected that in April or May next year, we can start the machines to supply power for our factory. The above two matters are closely related to the factory's future and must be diligently managed. We hope that the shareholders will provide guidance and instruction. After the chairman's report, discussions began immediately. The resolutions are as follows: (1) In accordance with the Ministry's order, the stock value will be changed from taels to yuan. (Resolution) The company's total share capital is 5,600,000 yuan, divided into 80,000 shares, each share worth 70 yuan. (2) Amendment to Article 24 of Chapter 4 of the company's articles of association. (Resolution) Directors and supervisors shall be elected by the shareholders' meeting from among the shareholders. Anyone with 40 or more shares in the company shall have the right to be elected. (3) When the company issues new shares, in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, a stamp shall be affixed to the shares to simplify procedures. (Resolution) The original proposal was approved. (4) The factory's workers requested a change in the distribution of surplus. (Resolution) Adhering to the principle of not harming the interests of both labor and capital, the matter shall be handled by the board of directors. (5) The company's annual report to the shareholders' meeting proposes to add a property directory. (Resolution) The original proposal was approved. After the discussions, shareholders voted to elect Xia Yucheng, Hong Lanyou, Wu Jichen, Zhou Meiquan, Zhao Shuyong, Li Qiqing, Shen Ranmou, Gao Rufu, and Cheng Botang as directors, and Chen Guangfu, Fang Juchuan, and Yun Jikun as supervisors. In addition to the commercial shares, the factory originally had official shares. In accordance with the regulations, there should be five official shareholder directors and one supervisor. The original letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government is recorded below: According to the proposal of the chairman at the 609th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, please appoint Hong Lanyou, Wu Baofeng, Li Yunliang, Cheng Peng, and Wu Cheng as official shareholder directors of Dasheng Yarn Factory, and Chen Guangfu as supervisor. The proposal has been approved. In addition to distributing the order, a corresponding letter is sent to your factory for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e178">China Life Insurance Advancement Association Expands Organization <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Life insurance in our country, like other industries, is still in its infancy. The intrusion of foreign merchants and the outflow of profits and rights have become undeniable facts. Although several state-run companies have been established recently, most of them hold the principle of "each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep," indifferent to each other, like a heap of loose sand, with no unity. If this continues, what can be imagined? Recently, five Chinese-owned life insurance companies in this city have united to organize the only propaganda agency in China's life insurance industry, named the China Life Insurance Advancement Association. The purpose is nothing more than to instill life insurance knowledge into the Chinese people as much as possible, so that the life insurance business can become common or socialized in our country. The president of the association is Zhang Sixu, the former director of the Intelligence Department when Chen Youren was the foreign minister two years ago. Mr. Zhang is one of the famous reporters in Shanghai, with extremely rich knowledge and experience. According to Mr. Zhang, the life insurance companies supporting the association include Huaan, Taishan, Ning Shao, Sincere, and China. Among the foreign companies that agree and are willing to join the cooperation are American-owned American International Assurance (AIA) and British-owned Four Seas Life Insurance, both of which have general manager offices in Shanghai and have a considerable history. Mr. Zhang also said that about a year ago, he obtained the support of the above three companies and began planning the organization of the Advancement Association. At that time, the prototype was barely formed and the operation was difficult. Although there were not many achievements in the past year, it has now won the sympathy of most companies in the country, and they have eagerly participated. Our mission in the future is to work hard and use various methods, such as advertisements, illustrations, publicity texts, and lectures, to conduct widespread publicity in the country, instill life insurance knowledge as much as possible, and encourage the Chinese people's interest in life insurance, so that the life insurance business in our country can flourish and grow, and reach a perfect state. We should also break the old concepts of the Chinese people, so that everyone recognizes the effectiveness of life insurance and understands the benefits of life insurance. According to the reason for the slow progress of life insurance in our country, there are probably two: first, because most people cannot really understand the principles of life insurance; second, because the ideology of the patriarchal society has been unbreakable for thousands of years in our country, and the concept of the family system is too deep, so they absolutely do not know the joint responsibility. Although this is the case, in recent times, with the eastward spread of European customs, the economic and social situation of our country has been undergoing rapid changes. Life insurance in our country seems to have occupied a considerable position. The future progress is truly unlimited. The emergence of new companies is like bamboo shoots after a rain. Bankers such as Song Hanzhang, Li Ming, and Xu Xinliu have also joined the life insurance industry to cooperate. It is really a good phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Seven Public Security Agencies Issue Proclamation Strictly Prohibiting Flower Gambling <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The poison of flower gambling is worse than floods and ferocious beasts. Therefore, Director Wen recently proclaimed to the chiefs of various districts at the bureau affairs meeting that they should cooperate fully to investigate and capture flower gambling, so as to ensure that it is eradicated within the territory. Therefore, inside and outside the city, such as Director Guan Gong of the First District Office, Director Li Jing of the Second District Office, Chief Yi Zuanren of the First Sub-district Office of the First District, Chief Liu Yunfang of the Second Sub-district Office of the First District, Chief Jin Dianyang of the Third Sub-district Office of the First District, Chief Shen Zhenhua of the First Sub-district Office of the Second District, and Chief Tang Jinghuan of the Second Sub-district Office of the Second District, after mutual discussion, decided to cooperate fully to ban flower gambling, and issued a joint proclamation from the seven agencies yesterday. The following is a copy: Regarding the joint proclamation, it is known that flower gambling is extremely pervasive and those who are most addicted to it will go bankrupt. Everyone knows the harm it causes. It has been banned for a long time, but illegal elements are blinded by greed. Although they have been repeatedly investigated and sent for prosecution, there are still secret instances of accepting bets, disregarding the law and harming the people. This is extremely hateful. As the district chief is responsible for this, it is imperative to eliminate this local hidden danger and eradicate it. In addition to ordering strict searches at any time and place, it is necessary to issue a joint proclamation to all people under jurisdiction: if anyone accepts bets or engages in flower gambling, once discovered, they will be severely punished and will not be lenient. Everyone should obey and not try the law again. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>The manager of the Haikingber Circus announced that the troupe will perform twice next Tuesday to benefit the unemployed in the city. The first performance will be at 5 PM and the second at 9:15 PM. The proceeds from ticket sales that day will be held by the director of the city's employment registration office to assist the poor unemployed and their families. At a time when major companies are silent, the circus, which is merely for entertainment, is offering this. While it may not have a profound relationship, it deeply considers this and provides concrete and generous assistance, which is commendable. It is said that the troupe will leave Shanghai for India at the end of this month, so there are not many days left for these performances. After this, it may be many years before one can see a large-scale circus like the Haikingber Circus again. Its famous menagerie, with lions, tigers, leopards, elephants, and other wild animals, is open every day at 10 AM. The wild animals are fed at 11 AM.</p>

The various dance music played was very enthusiastic, and each person in the band had a special performance while playing, which can be said to be unprecedented in Shanghai. Finally, the black performers who came with the band performed, with funny footwork and dances, and the whole audience applauded. It is also heard that although the hotel has not yet officially announced the opening date, Chinese and Westerners have been booking seats one after another. There have also been several cases of using it as a wedding hall, mainly because the ballroom upstairs and downstairs can accommodate more than two thousand people.

<h3 id="e195">Special Educational Funds for Zhejiang Province: Guarantee Measures Established丨Implemented in Three Phases丨First, Allocate 90,000 Monthly from Foil Tax Items丨Provincial Government Meeting Decision Imminent for Implementation <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou Dispatch) Special funds have been designated to guarantee educational expenses for Zhejiang Province. Since provincial schools submitted opinions to the provincial government last year, Chairman Lu and other members of the provincial government have expressed strong support in principle. However, due to the province's severe financial difficulties, it was impossible to designate a large sum of money immediately. Although the matter was recognized as essential, plans were to be made gradually as opportunities arose. In the past month, the Education Department and the Finance Department have been actively working to achieve this goal. After thorough discussions between Directors Zhou and Chen of the two departments, a general framework has reportedly been established. The two departments have jointly drafted measures for the custody and payment of special provincial education funds, which have been submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for review. Implementation will commence upon approval by the provincial government meeting. It is reported that the special fund custody measures stipulate implementation in three phases. The first phase will designate funds from foil tax items, initially allocating only 90,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.08 million yuan per year, starting from November. The second phase will also designate funds from foil tax items, initially allocating 100,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.2 million yuan per year, plus the total amount of tobacco and alcohol surcharges, approximately 200,000 yuan per year, totaling 1.4 million yuan, starting from July of the 23rd year [of the Republic]. The third phase will begin in May of the 24th year [of the Republic] (when the slaughter tax mortgage expires), adding approximately 600,000 yuan annually from the slaughter tax in addition to the aforementioned foil tax and tobacco and alcohol surcharges, bringing the total to 2 million yuan, roughly equivalent to the budgeted amount for education expenses this year (excluding administrative expenses for the Education Department and educational income such as tuition fees). Detailed measures are expected to be announced within three to five days.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Joint University of Shanghai's Sorrowful Appeal to the Soldiers of the 19th Route Army: Pointing Guns Inward is Self-Estrangement from the People 丨Also Encouraging all Shanghai Students to Sharpen Their Resolve to Quell the Rebellion <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Student Union of Shanghai Universities yesterday issued a sorrowful appeal to the soldiers of the 19th Route Army and a letter of encouragement to all Shanghai students. These are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Appeal to the 19th Route Army <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>To all the soldiers of the 19th Route Army in Fuzhou: In these days of internal and external troubles, when the survival of the nation is on the line, uniting for rescue is still precarious. Yet, we have heard that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others have usurped Fuzhou, falsely using the name of our 19th Route Army to rally rebellious parties, advocating alignment with the communists, seceding from the party, changing the national flag, and spreading alarming messages. These actions by Chen Mingshu and his cohorts are driven by ulterior motives, aiming to rebel against the party and disrupt the nation. Their ultimate disgrace is not worth pitying. However, our 19th Route Army, with its glorious history, is now being held hostage by a few, incurring a disgraceful name. This would not only be a significant loss to the national spirit but also bring joy to our enemies while causing grief to those who support us. Alas, the white bones of the revolutionary martyrs of the Northern Expedition have not yet cooled, and the blood of the soldiers who died in the fight against the Japanese and in the suppression of the communists is still fresh. Our loyal and brave soldiers of the 19th Route Army, who earned their reputation by resisting the Japanese, suppressing the communists, and not participating in internal wars, are now pointing their guns inward, willingly becoming the leaders of those who destroy the party and the nation. This is no less than self-estrangement from the people and a destruction of their own history. If the martyrs who resisted the Japanese and suppressed the communists were aware of this, they would weep bitterly in their graves. We deeply believe that many soldiers in the 19th Route Army understand righteousness. Their enthusiasm for cherishing their own precious history and their conscience for safeguarding the survival of the nation and the people may be temporarily obscured by the deception of treacherous individuals, but eventually, they will deeply reflect and strive to extricate themselves. During the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, we, the students of all universities in Shanghai, were fortunate to have some association with your army, either through offering supplies or sharing the battlefield. We dare to express our humble opinions and tearfully appeal to you. We hope that you will awaken to the truth, put righteousness above family, arrest all the treacherous villains and offer them to the central government, and abolish the illegal organization to apologize to the people. This is the only way to preserve the glorious reputation of the 19th Route Army and save the nation from its imminent demise. The decision rests on this moment. We would be most fortunate if you would heed our words. Respectfully, the Joint Student Union of Shanghai Universities.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Letter of Encouragement to all Shanghai Students <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The national crisis is more severe than ever. To overcome this difficult situation, we must unite and strengthen our defenses, be mindful of the dangers of a collapsing nest and broken eggs, and prepare for a desperate last stand. Yet, news has arrived that Chen Mingshu and others have colluded with the communists, forming a puppet government in Fujian and carrying out a rebellion. This heartbreaking and insane behavior is self-estrangement from the people and will soon collapse. It is not a major threat. However, our union still feels compelled to address all university students in Shanghai. This time, the Fujian Incident, in its abandonment of the national title and its changing of the flag, is a clear demonstration of being a puppet of the Soviet Union, a fact that is universally recognized. Its slogans of dividing farmers, workers, merchants, scholars, and soldiers further indicate its integration with the communists in Jiangxi. Under these circumstances, suppressing the rebellion is suppressing the communists, and suppressing the communists is suppressing the rebellion. Quelling the rebellion and suppressing the communists are now one and the same. Therefore, we should strengthen our resolve, rise up, and, under the leadership of the central government, bravely move forward, remaining calm and fighting hard, without complacency or fear of difficulty. We must ensure that all 50,000 university students in Shanghai become the backbone of suppressing the rebellion and stabilizing the country, eliminating the source of this internal turmoil, striving for the survival of the nation, and seeking a way out for the people. Our union is willing to encourage all students in Shanghai to work together. Respectfully, the Joint Student Union of Shanghai Universities.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Sports, The Last Five Minutes: Jiaotong Defeats Fudan, One to Zero丨Zhou Guangzhong Scores at the Last Moment丨Both Sides Attack and Defend Vigorously <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>In the Jiangnan University Football Championship, there was an important match yesterday, Jiaotong versus Fudan, meeting in Xujiahui to compete for the final spot. This is because Jinan University is assured of a final spot, and besides Jiaotong and Fudan, no one else is capable of challenging Jinan for the final. Yesterday, the Jiaotong University football field was surrounded by spectators. The two teams were evenly matched, and amidst the roaring cheers, they fought fiercely for 85 minutes without a breakthrough. Finally, in the last five minutes, Jiaotong's Zhou Guangzhong scored a goal, deciding the outcome. The referee was Shen Huichun.</p>
<h3 id="e202">One Attack, One Defense <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Jiaotong excels at attacking, while Fudan excels at defending, creating yesterday's situation. Jiaotong's five forwards coordinated well, and the midfield also provided support. Shen Guanlan was a strong center back. Thus, Jiaotong was frequently seen circling around Fudan's goal, but Fudan's defense was strong, with Yang Mingquan's goalkeeping being particularly outstanding, along with the defenders Guan Xun'an and Zhang Rong. Therefore, yesterday's match was a contest between attack and defense. It's a pity that Jiaotong's forwards lacked finishing ability, otherwise, Jiaotong would have won earlier.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Zero to Zero <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The entire first half of 45 minutes was dominated by Jiaotong, which relentlessly attacked Fudan. Chen Gongyu made a good pass, and Wan Xianghua received it and sprinted forward, but the center forward lacked strength and missed the opportunity. Then, the right winger Xue Wenxiu made a brilliant pass, and Tong Guangzhong jumped up to head the ball, but Yang Mingquan also jumped up and lightly tapped the ball, which fell to the left wing, creating a very dangerous situation. Wan Xianghua rushed up but failed to get the ball. These were some of the highlights of the first half. With one attack and one defense, the first half ended zero to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Last Kick <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, each side made one or two substitutions. Fudan showed signs of resurgence and launched fierce counterattacks. Wang Wenjing made two forward rushes on the left wing with great momentum. Yu Shunzhang once tried to head the ball but failed. Zhou Shaowen and others gave their all, but gradually showed signs of fatigue. Jiaotong's counterattacks returned. Wan Xianghua made three attempts on goal, but all failed. A draw seemed inevitable. Unexpectedly, in the last five minutes, Xue Wenxiu dribbled up the left wing and crossed the ball. Without warning, Zhou Guangzhong had already flashed in front of the goal and lightly tapped the ball in. Guan Xun'an was caught off guard. This one kick sealed the victory.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 25th) In the Jiangnan University Football Championship, Jinan played against Jinling at 3:00 PM on the 25th at the Jinan University stadium. The referee was Zhang Xinfu. After the kickoff, Jinan attacked fiercely, repeatedly advancing towards Jinling. After forty minutes, Xu Yahui kicked in a goal, making the score one to zero in the first half. After the start of the second half, Jinan's attack was even more intense. Within four minutes, Jinan's Fu Hexuan scored another goal. At this point, Jinling's situation was dire. Although they wanted to counterattack, they were unable to do so because Jinan's attack and defense were both excellent. Finally, Xu Yahui scored another goal, making the score two to zero in the second half. As a result, Jinan defeated Jinling by a score of three to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Central Defeats Great China丨Two to One丨 <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th) In the Jiangnan University Football Championship, Central played against Great China at 2:30 PM on the 25th at the Central University stadium. The referee was Wang Jing. Within the first fifteen minutes of the match, Lin Ding, Central University's cross-country star, passed the ball to Wu Shunwen, who casually took a hard and powerful shot directly at Great China's goal. The goalkeeper could not defend it, resulting in a goal. Seeing their poor formation, the Great China team launched a fierce attack for a long time. After resting, within the first five minutes, the ball reached Central University's goal. Goalkeeper Jiang Lianggui had already caught the ball, but accidentally slipped and fell, causing the ball to fall from his hands. Huang Guanzhi arrived just in time and kicked it in, effortlessly. The first half ended in a one-to-one tie. After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. Central University's attack was even more intense, and the ball was often in front of Great China's goal. Great China was under attack and on the verge of collapse, so they adjusted their strategy and adopted a defensive stance. Central University had many good shots, but they were all blocked by the goalkeeper. With three minutes remaining, Central University launched a fierce forward attack. Li Pan kicked the ball forcefully, hitting the top crossbar of Great China's goal, and it swirled down. Xu Yusu used his body to block the goalkeeper, preventing him from using his catching skills, so the ball fell into the goal, resulting in a score of one to zero in the second half. As a result, Central University defeated Great China by a score of two to one.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Tung Wah Football Team to Face Western Police Today丨First Division Match at 3:00 PM at Recreation Ground丨Request to Reschedule Due to Injured Players Denied <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Ever since the Tung Wah football team suffered successive defeats by Yau Yau due to serious injuries to several players, those concerned about football have been paying close attention to today's match against the Western Police. How will Tung Wah face this challenge? The Western Police are known to be a strong and resilient team among the Western football teams. Although they lost to Tung Wah in the Crichton Cup and to Yau Yau in a friendly match, they did not field their most complete lineup in either game. Now, observing that they have won every match in the league, their momentum is high, and their strength should not be underestimated. Moreover, today, Tung Wah's strength is greatly diminished due to the absence of Li Ning, Cao Qiuting, Yuan Qingwu, Li Yichen, and others due to injuries or other reasons. They cannot be compared to their past selves. After the injuries to its players last week, Tung Wah requested a postponement because it could not gather its full team, but the Western Football Association denied the request, citing scheduling issues and a lack of suitable venues. Tung Wah did not want to forfeit, so after consultation by the committee, they will still uphold their past spirit, abide by the schedule, and勉强[reluctantly] field a team. The outcome remains to be seen. It is learned that, except for those who are injured and unable to play, the remaining players will compete despite their injuries. It is hoped that the team will maintain its usual spirit, strive to face the challenge, and not be discouraged. Although the outcome is uncertain, it will not detract from the fighting spirit of the athletes.

<h3 id="e210">Scott Cup: Yau Yau Eliminated Yesterday丨Rangers Wins Four to Three丨Yau Yau Led Twice <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Rangers played Yau Yau yesterday. The forwards and defenders on both sides were worth watching. Although Yau Yau was ahead with a score of two to one in the first half, they were constantly under intense pressure from the opponent, and the situation was unfavorable. Not long after the start of the second half, Rangers' center back took a long shot, forcing a tie. After that, Yau Yau took the lead again with a score of three to two, but Rangers soon caught up and won with a score of four to three. Some spectators, acting emotionally, expressed various dissatisfactions with Yau Yau. This is not only inappropriate but also lacks the proper attitude of a spectator.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Stealing the Golden Needle <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yau Yau kicked off, but Rangers intercepted the ball halfway and launched a major counterattack, repeatedly forcing corner kicks. As a result, the area in front of Yau Yau's goal was full of danger. Fortunately, Wang Shusen repeatedly saved the day. However, because Rangers' forwards continued to attack relentlessly, Huang Ruihua headed out a ball, which was obtained by Simons, who passed it to Alger nearby. With trouble on the western front and the central hub shaken, Haberk stole the golden needle from Wang Shusen. Rot saw the joy of Rangers, pulled back a ball and passed into the gate.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Two Goals in Return <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>After Rangers scored a goal, their momentum became even stronger. Tang Yongchun was very busy, punching and kicking. Within ten minutes, they barely managed to hold on. Sun Tie-leg furiously commanded his troops and launched a counterattack. A-Qiao was slippery and unpredictable, and he quickly entered the defense, picking out a central hub. Sun Tie-leg dribbled the ball, and Li Shuoyou wanted to shoot but couldn't and fell. However, Li Shuoyou received help from Xi Qiaosheng. Inside the penalty area, Sun Jinshun fought with Chin Sheng. Little Li found an opportunity to shoot, resulting in a tie. After ten minutes of melee, Chen Jiaqiu passed to Xi Qiaosheng. A-Qiao passed it to Zhong Nansen, hesitated a little, and the ball went to Tie-leg, who dribbled it into the gate, making it two to one, turning defeat into victory.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Taking the Lead Again <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>After the break, with the applause and cheers of the Western spectators, Rangers made progress. The momentum of their attack was very grand. Huang Ruihua sent the ball out of danger twice, but still couldn't protect the territory. Simons broke into the Yau Yau's central defense line at seven minutes, took advantage of people's unpreparedness, and shot hard, Tang Yongchun was caught off guard, and it became a tie again. Alger had been selected for the inter-port team, and his skill was unquestionable. Twice he passed urgent balls to Yau Yau's gate, Rot headed the ball twice but missed, which annoyed Sun Jinshun, who launched a northern expedition, rushing forward alone like a downpour. The two defenders, Chin and Locke, were no match and were unable to resist, and Cochran lost his mind, leaving the old nest, so Sun scored into the empty gate, making it three to two.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Ultimately Failing <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>After Yau Yau took the lead again, their momentum could not be sustained. After several back-and-forths, Rangers launched a fierce counterattack. Haberk watched Sun Jinshun, Simons blocked Li Shiyou, and Alger roamed around the east, entering the area guarded by Zhuang Shihong, and passed to Haberk. Outside Yau Yau's goal line, they entangled for a while. Baosailie kicked the ball, Tang Yongchun's vision was blocked by the two defenders, and by the time he glimpsed the ball, it was too late to save it, and he slid into the net from the edge. Not long after, Simons again had the opportunity to fire a shot from thirty yards, creating a four-three situation. After this, Sun Jinshun had two urgent shots, but unfortunately they were slightly off target. He was eliminated in the Scott Cup with a score of three to four.</p>

<p>Xia Guang Defeats Chongde (Group A)…28 to 27</p>
<p>Jiang Jiang Defeats Hua Dong (Group B)…26 to 24</p>
<p>Last night, two matches were held. In Group A, the match between Xia Guang and Chongde was the final showdown.  Throughout the match, Chongde initially took the lead, with Xia Guang following closely behind. During the first two quarters, it seemed Xia Guang might not catch up. At halftime, Chongde led by a significant margin of 20 to 7. When the second half began, the Xia Guang players showed great improvement. With the support of her teammates, Lu Jianfang accurately scored several times. Zhuang Lingzhao also made successful free throws, significantly closing the score gap. In the third quarter, Chongde performed poorly, only scoring three additional points. In the fourth quarter, the smaller Chongde players still showed no revitalized spirit. Xia Guang's offensive became more pronounced, with Lu and Zhuang finding opportunities to score from both sides. As time ran out, Xia Guang took the lead with 28 to 27, defeating Chongde by one point. In Group B, Jiang Jiang defeated Hua Dong with a final score of 26 to 24. The results of the two matches are as follows:</p>

<p>Although the west wind is strong, it cannot blow away the autumn scenery of the Huangpu River. The chrysanthemums are plump, still retaining the autumn colors of Jiangnan. Plus, the weather is neither cold nor hot, making it the perfect time for athletes to show their skills. Therefore, we have decided to, in addition to our usual work of cutting and pasting, also engage in the game of football. We have now formed a mixed lineup, willing to use the remaining strength from wielding pens. Any team willing to compete with us is welcome to send a challenge. You must know that although we are called "old men," we are not weak. When we go to war, we do not care about success or failure. If we are lucky enough to win, we will naturally be happy and laughing. If we unfortunately fail, we will still be polite. If there are people who dare to provoke the "old men," they will surely experience our power. As for our lineup, it is currently tentatively as follows:</p>

<p>Special Issue 丨Crab</p>
<h3 id="e230">Lament for Crabs <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>"The navel is round in September, pointed in October." Lake crabs are already on the market again. Iron cages are set up in front of wine shops or wild game stores. The gutless gentlemen in the cages are all foaming at the mouth, moving sideways and upwards, climbing non-stop, as if trying to escape; but because they don't have the strength of tigers or rhinos, they can only sigh softly. Speculating on their psychology: who doesn't have the hope of returning my freedom? And who doesn't have the desire to escape the invasion of foreign races 丨 humans 丨? However, their great enemy is moving their index finger, eager to satisfy their appetite. Then, the poor gentlemen can only surrender their lives without resistance.</p>
<p>Crabs move sideways, and they are cold-blooded. Because they move sideways, they can only dominate in their own circle. Because they are cold-blooded, their kind are tied up one by one by humans to be devoured, but they remain indifferent. Therefore, according to the principle of "survival of the fittest," crabs being eaten by humans is originally "self-inflicted, unpardonable," and there's no need for us 丨 humans 丨 to lament them. This refers to live crabs. As for dead crabs, logically, people should have a sense of pity and not use them as snacks. However, the dead crabs are still tied up tightly, lined up, with their white navels facing the sky, and no longer foaming or sighing softly. These kinds of dead crabs are naturally disdained by those who hold crabs and admire chrysanthemums; but those friends in short clothes have a predilection for scab eating. It is said that when a crab is about to die but not yet dead, its fat is still very thick. If you don't eat it at this time, when will you eat it! Moreover, dead crabs are always easier to subdue than live crabs. Live crabs still have two giant claws to defend themselves, and people can't help but be wary of them; now that they are about to die, their claws have also lost their ability to resist, and their fat can naturally be devoured. Therefore, comparing live crabs and dead crabs, it seems that dead crabs are more lamentable, especially those that are about to die.</p>
<p>I don't know why, every time I walk past a crab stall and see the live crabs in the cages and the dead crabs outside the cages, I always feel shocked and write Lament for Crabs.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Peculiarities of Crabs <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Jie</p>
<p>Crab. In this season, whoever hears the word "crab" will be very excited, especially using crab as a topic. It can really be considered the most up-to-date article. However, what I am preparing to write here is not a study of blue backs, red claws, or 工-shaped patterns, nor is it anecdotes of famous people eating crabs after their deaths; but rather a few seemingly magical little stories, not self-deceiving myths!</p>
<p>One early morning in late autumn, at that time; I was not yet an adult, but I already knew the taste of crabs, so when the big crabs came on the market, I often followed the adults to hold crabs, drink wine, and have fun. One day, I and a few children went to a small river to play with boats. There happened to be someone setting up crab weirs in the river to catch crabs. We watched him catch the crabs that had been trapped in the weirs overnight, big and small, quite a few indeed; later, he suddenly caught a small group of three crabs connected together. Even after landing on the shore, they still did not separate. Not only did we all find it very strange, but even the crab catcher expressed great surprise. So he tried hard to separate them and found out that the middle crab was a cripple who had lost eight legs, so the two crabs next to it were carrying him in the river. At that time, my knowledge was limited, and I only felt it was fun, but now that I think about it, I can't help but admire the righteousness of the two crabs!</p>
<p>There is also a tenant in my family named Zhou Daxie, who is a famous strongman. When the villagers fight, whichever side he joins, that side is sure to win. It is said that he can kill a water buffalo with his bare hands and can also lift the stone railing by the well high up. I have never seen him kill a cow with my own eyes, but the scene of him lifting the well stone railing was indeed performed in front of me. At that time, I asked him why he had such great strength. He said: "Before I was sixteen, I was just an ordinary person. When I fought with others, I often ran away; in the autumn of that year, I went to Dongting Mountain and stayed at a friend's house. My friend was a fisherman, and he always made a living by catching crabs in the autumn. One night, I happened to be interested and went to work with him. I don't know how, but suddenly we caught a big crab that was bigger than a large flower bowl. Including the legs, the width must be more than two feet. As soon as I saw it, I was eager to eat it and begged my friend to leave it for me to drink with. My friend said that such a big crab might be harmful and advised me not to eat it. But I didn't see anything special about the crab, so I finally cooked it and ate it. Since then, my strength has increased unconsciously, especially my two arms." The above words were all said by Zhou Daxie himself and confirmed by others, but this guy later died silently and did not use his great strength in any way.</p>

<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>The late calligrapher Li Meian, also known as Qing Daoren, loved crabs the most in his life. He could eat a hundred in one breath, and people called him Li Baixie (Li Hundred Crabs). This is the highest record for eating crabs.</p>
<p>Wu Guren, a poet of the Qing Dynasty, wrote a poem in Jianteng Xiaoji: "The crab sky knows the frost the earliest, the time after the oranges is yours, the old feelings can't help but be a little sour, when Wu Ji rubs it in her hand at the feast." The words "crab sky" are very new.</p>
<p>The late US President Harding died suddenly a few years ago. For a time, newspapers competed to report that he had been poisoned by crabs. Recently, someone wrote a book strongly arguing that it was not true, saying that his death had other reasons, which cannot be verified.</p>
<p>There are very few books about crabs. There were two in the Song Dynasty, one was Chuan Gong's Crab Manual, divided into two volumes, and the other was Gao Sisun's Xie Lue, with four volumes, describing it in the most detail. In the Tang Dynasty, there was a Crab Chronicle, written by the poet Chen Guimeng. After Chuan Gong, Chu Renhuo of the Qing Dynasty wrote Xu Xie Pu. These four gentlemen can be regarded as the confidants of the gutless gentleman.</p>
<p>The smallest type of crab is called the louse crab. The crab shell is only as big as an almond. Marinate it in good soy sauce and eat it the next day. The taste is very fresh and can be used as a snack.</p>
<p>Zhu Qigong, a famous scholar of the Qing Dynasty, loved crabs. One day, he was drinking and splitting crabs when a servant reported that a senior official had come to visit. Qigong scolded, "I won't exchange eight legs for a high official!" He continued to eat his crabs. The poet Li Zixiang gave him a poem with the line "Only call for turbid wine to pour on the madman, I am happy that the frost claw is better than a hot official," which was passed down as a good story at the time.</p>
<p>At the New World Amusement Park a few years ago, a beauty crab was displayed, which caused a sensation. The crab shell had a natural painting on it, like a peerless beauty, a different kind of crab.</p>
<p>Qiaodui Lu recorded: "There was an imperial censor who was inspecting Songjiang. The prefect, an old friend, invited him to drink, and jokingly gave him a couplet: 'The furnace fish has four gills, and one tail occupies Songjiang alone.' The prefect said: 'The crab has eight feet, and two claws move horizontally across the world.' The imperial censor knew that he was satirizing him, and laughed." How many people are there today who move horizontally across the world with their two claws?</p>
<p>The above are eight anecdotes in total, matching the number of crab legs.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Cooking Crabs <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>A string of crabs is hanging upside down. "Squeak, squeak" they are spitting white foam, the two little eyes are very small, the two claws are very big, and several crabs have become disabled, which is caused by the trampling of the people who catch and sell crabs, which makes me think of the wounded soldiers in the rear hospital. However, they and they are still a group waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Looking at their shape is quite pitiful. Their legs are constantly stretching, trying to struggle. I think of how free and unrestrained these little lives were when they were moving sideways in the sandy reed swamp. But now they are stranded and have to be put into the pot to be cooked one by one, and torn apart and eaten piece by piece.</p>
<p>I like to eat crabs but I can't bear to watch them being cooked.</p>
<p>The scene of cooking crabs will make people think of the embarrassment of those who are escaping from disasters.</p>
<p>First, live, fresh crabs are caught into the pot. The pot is cold, and the water is also cold. The crabs feel strange inside and crawl "squeak, squeak", but the water warms up little by little, and the crawling becomes tighter and more frequent, the steps to escape are chaotic, the water is hot, some climb halfway up the pot and then "cluck" slide down, the ones that slide down climb up again, climb up and slide down again... The "squeak, squeak" sound is sparse, and only the "gudu gudu" sound of boiling water is heard. Their lives are all over. When they are taken out of the pot, they are just a pile of corpses wearing blood-stained clothes.</p>
<p>There are also drunk crabs, which are anesthetized with wine and stuffed into jars. There are also flour paste crabs, which are beheaded by the cooks. They are eaten raw and skinned alive, suffering cruel torture. The small people in deep water and hot fire are no different from crabs. However, the people who cook crabs want to eat crabs, do the people who cook small people also want to prevent the small people from eating!</p>
<p>Elegant scholars who are holding crabs and admiring chrysanthemums, put down this glass of wine for a moment and listen to the groans of those in disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Anecdotes About Crabs <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Qian</p>
<p>After a few gusts of autumn wind and rain, the scenery of the suburbs is already drooping willows full of sorrow and maple leaves shaking red. The cries of crab sellers in the streets and alleys are endless, making people think of the elegant things of holding crabs and drinking wine.</p>
<p>The crabs in Beijing and Shanghai are best known for being produced in Yangcheng Lake, and the tenderness and deliciousness of the meat have long been well known. I teach in Wumen, which is close at hand. In fact, it should not be difficult to taste the delicacies, but the crabs on the market are cherished and self-regarded as rare goods, and each one costs one gold, which is not something that our humble teachers can afford. In addition, the students' papers are piled up on the table, and there is no time to enjoy the fun in time. In the midst of all kinds of boredom, let me tell a story about crabs as a way to satisfy my cravings without actually eating them!</p>
<p>The event took place during the Shunzhi period of the late Qing Dynasty. The protagonists were Zhang Yushu and County Magistrate Wu of Yanghu County丨now merged into Wujin County丨.</p>
<p>Zhang Yushu was a loyal, honest, and incorruptible prime minister who hated corrupt officials and bureaucrats the most in his life. In his later years, he retired to the Lin Garden and returned to his hometown of Zhenjiang, but he did not hold the principle of "not being in his position, not planning his affairs". He still often traveled incognito, disguised as a rural old man, to solve many injustices among the people. Therefore, local officials in the vicinity were a little bit apprehensive when they encountered this old man.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Wu of Yanghu, although only a ninth-rank official, was very powerful. He colluded with local gentry and oppressed the villagers. When this news reached the old man Zhang's ears, he disguised himself as a private school teacher and went to Yanghu to seek a teaching position. He was very good at giving guidance and was quite praised by the county magistrate. Before long, a grand banquet was held for the gentry in the office, and the old man Zhang was also among those invited. On this day, there was a lot of coming and going, and it was extremely prosperous. When it was time to take their seats, everyone pushed and shoved, and no one wanted to sit in the chief seat. Finally, they pushed it to Zhang Yushu, who was not polite at all. Everyone was not happy in their stomachs, and the sarcastic eyes all focused on the old man Zhang. The first dish was crab powder. Before the order to start eating was given, the teacher was asked to compose a poem about crabs. In their minds, they just wanted to tease him. The talented Zhang Yushu could just take the opportunity to express himself and said without thinking:</p>
<p>Eight feet are mixed and round.</p>
<p>Everyone heard this stupid and vulgar verse, and there was a great laughter like booing in the theater. Before the laughter had stopped, the second sentence came:</p>
<p>Who knows there is gold in the belly.</p>
<p>This was a bit sweet and aftertaste like eating olives. The last two sentences were said in one breath:</p>
<p>Two pincers push open the waves of the future,</p>
<p>What if Yanghu is ten thousand miles deep?</p>
<p>Everyone heard the implication, knew that it was the old man Zhang's trick, and prostrated themselves, not daring to look up. The old man Zhang gave them a great lesson and left the yamen without waiting for the end of the banquet.</p>
<p>When we are sitting and eating crabs, wouldn't it be more interesting to tell a story about crabs?</p>
<h3 id="e235">Shaoxing Crabs <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jufu</p>
<p>The most popular crabs in Shanghai are those from Yangcheng Lake. These crabs are large and plump, with slightly yellowish shells. It's said that the water in Yangcheng Lake is very clear, which is why the crabs from there are famous. But actually, the best crabs to eat are those from Shaoxing. The inland rivers of Shaoxing stretch 200 li from east to west and over 100 li from north to south. The former three counties of Shanyin, Kuaiji, and Xiaoshan encompass over 1,000 li, filled with large rivers and lakes. The freshness of the water is unmatched by any other place. The large crabs from Shaoxing have a deliciousness that can be described as the best in the country. Every year in late autumn, the fishermen in the inland villages build bamboo dams. On dark and windy nights, the "viscera-less gentlemen" (crabs) march sideways in groups. Round ones come first, followed by sideways ones. In each group, the round ones make up about eight or nine out of ten, while the long ones only make up one or two out of ten. Some say, "Crabs practice polygamy." The villagers, eager to taste the deliciousness, stay up all night, watching and waiting. After dusk, they come creeping and crawling. They never deviate from their path when crossing the dams. The villagers simply shine a light on them and catch them easily. They catch dozens at a time. Their shells are hard as iron. The next day, they buy a few catties of wine, boil the crabs, and feast on them. The crabs from Yangcheng Lake simply cannot compare.</p>
<p>When I was studying in Shaoxing as a child, I always had to eat "rice paddy crabs" (as the Shaoxing people call them) once a year. Three years ago, a relative returned from Guangdong to visit his family in Shaoxing and had already learned to drink alcohol. My relatives knew I liked this stuff, so they prepared a lot of dishes: fish, shrimp, meat, and especially the Shaoxing crabs, which I still remember with a very fresh and delicious aftertaste.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Basic Knowledge: Eating Crab Knowledge <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Biguang</p>
<p>When the yellow chrysanthemums bloom and the red maple leaves are dyed, it is the time to hold crabs and drink wine. However, although crabs are delicious, they can be very harmful to a person's nutrition. Therefore, people who love crabs should understand the basic knowledge of eating crabs.</p>
<p>When choosing crabs for boiling, you must choose those with hard shells. The two large claws should be hairy, and the eight legs should be golden yellow. The hair on the legs should also be yellow. These crabs can be described as having rich roe and plump claws. If you encounter a crab with only one claw, or claws without hair, eating it can easily cause illness. To boil crabs, first wash the crabs clean with a hard-bristled brush, squeeze out the mud from the crab's eyes, and put a few grains of salt and a slice of ginger in the eyes. Tie them up with hemp rope, put some perilla leaves in the pot, and steam them. The taste will definitely be exceptionally delicious. ▲ Treatment for crab poisoning Because crabs are aquatic animals, they can destroy vitamins. People with weak constitutions are prone to poisoning after eating them. Most people who are poisoned suffer from abdominal pain. If you suffer from abdominal pain after eating crabs, you can eat a few coins' worth of longan meat to stop the pain and detoxify. Pregnant women must not eat crabs, as it may cause a miscarriage. This is because there is an abortifacient formula in traditional Chinese medicine called crab claw soup. Even if eating crabs does not necessarily cause everyone to miscarry, it is still too cold. Pregnant women should avoid eating many things, such as eating rabbit meat causing the child to have a cleft lip, and eating sparrow meat causing the child to be promiscuous.</p>
<p>To store fresh crabs so that they do not die and to make their meat and roe more plump and delicious, isn't that very difficult? I have a method. Use a small basket, fill it halfway with rice, put the fresh crab in, cover it with rice, and place it in a dark place. Take out the crab and cook it after half a year. The crab's belly will definitely have very beautiful roe oil, but the grains in the basket will have turned into empty shells. ▲ Crabs and persimmons are contradictory Crabs are cold, and persimmons are also cold. According to the Compendium of Materia Medica, crabs and persimmons are the most taboo. Those who violate this may die or become ill. I advise friends who eat crabs not to eat persimmons after eating crabs, and vice versa. Please do not play with your life!</p>
<p>▲ The medicinal effects of crabs When you are eating crabs, please do not forget! When separating the crab back from the crab belly, there is a crab "clothing" inside. Quickly take it off while it is still hot and rub it on places prone to frostbite in the cold winter. In winter, you will definitely be surprised why you didn't get frostbite this year! Gather the crab shells together, and in the summer, grind them into powder, mix them with wood shavings, and burn them to kill mosquitoes. It is very effective.</p>
<p>▲ The crab "monk" is a disease demon In the crab's shell, there is something that looks like a monk, with a slightly bitter and salty taste. Friends who eat crabs, quickly do not eat it, because eating it can easily lead to disease.</p>
<p>How to stew crab Crabs can be stewed. Wash the crab, put it in a bowl, add soy sauce, salt, good wine, and lard, and stew it on top of the rice cooker. It is good for drinking wine and eating rice, and it is very simple.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Financial: Bank of America Exchange Continues to Shrink, Benchmark Rises Another $8.40. Unfavorable US News Caused Initial Dip, Recovery Due to Silver Firms Seeking to Settle USD Exchange. <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The gold market saw continuous appreciation of exchange rates due to stagnant US government gold buying prices, yet the trajectory over the half-day was convoluted, driven by overseas news. Early morning saw a decline in exchange rates as overseas silver markets saw sterling appreciate and the US dollar depreciate. The Far East Silver Exchange saw forward silver prices contract by amounts between 1.2 and 2.5 fen. Spot gold in London appreciated by 5 pence, while US government gold buying prices remained static. Stocks increased by 9.3 cents, US wheat was up 1.125 fen, US cotton rose by 10 points. The wool market opened strong at above 10 dollars, subsequently increasing to 14 dollars before falling back. Initially, the market weakened due to the hardening exchange rate, but rose on rumors of the US Chamber of Commerce requesting a return to the gold standard. However, due to continued resistance from the Yokohama Specie Bank, a Reuters dispatch from Wenquan reported that President Roosevelt firmly stated he had no intention of changing the gold policy, causing a further decline. Subsequently, the domestic market tightened as silver companies and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sought to settle USD exchanges, boosting confidence. Western merchant Lale also made purchases. A Reuters dispatch reported that the French situation remained precarious, pushing prices above 10 dollars. Profit-taking strengthened at high prices, resulting in a struggle. The spot price was 1108 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is summarized below:</p>
<p>Opened at 708 yuan 8 jiao, up 7 yuan 2 jiao compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 9 yuan. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of Sterling at 1 shilling 3 pence 375, and USD at 33 yuan 4375. Hengyu and Hengxing immediately sold at 7 yuan upon entering the market. News from foreign telegrams reported that the US Chamber of Commerce was requesting a return to the gold standard, momentarily pushing prices to 9 yuan 5 jiao. The Yokohama Specie Bank continued to resist the March USD at 375, and the exchange market was flooded. Later, Yiliang resisted the March contract at half a yuan, causing large players such as Hengxing, Hengyu, Yida, Yongyuanfeng, Yongda, Decheng, and Fuyu to sell, resulting in a drop to 5 yuan 5 jiao. News also turned negative. Zhaofengchang and Bingxing bought at low prices and stabilized, but still saw a decline. It was learned that the HSBC listing would see Sterling rise by 125 and the USD fall by 25, stabilizing the situation. Prices fluctuated around 7 yuan, and Hua merchants sought to settle USD exchanges, tightening the domestic market. Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Hengxing, and Shunli all entered the market. Qiao Zhifu also came to settle the January USD at 875, pushing prices above 8 yuan. Hengtai supplied and prices fell again. Before long, the domestic market continued to tighten. Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongda, Xingyong, and others advanced to 711 yuan 8 jiao as foreign news turned favorable. Dealers from Dalian and Dade or Tongtaichang sold, while HSBC and the Yokohama Specie Bank resisted the March USD at 25. Subsequently, Jin Cheng came out at 3125, gradually retreating to 698 yuan 1 jiao. Hengyu made slight purchases, and the situation remained stable. Yuanmao, Yongyi, and Dada supplied multiple times, retreating to 8 yuan. Huabi took the February USD at 0625 and the March USD at 3125. Korea took the same month at 25. Bingxing, Fuyu, and Hengxing successively advanced, returning to 710 yuan 2 jiao. The noon close was 710 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 9 yuan 8 jiao. After the market closed, Hengxing and others bought, causing a slight decline but remaining level. The highest price during the half-day was 711 yuan 8 jiao, and the lowest price was 705 yuan 5 jiao, a difference of 6 yuan 3 jiao. The result was an increase of 8 yuan 4 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price, due to the HSBC Bank shrinking the USD listing by 25, was 33 yuan, combined with the benchmark price of 727 yuan. According to the closing price, it was pressed by about 17 yuan, approximately 3 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for the current month was 724 yuan, December was 716 yuan, and January was 710 yuan. The morning water supplement was 724 yuan. The spot price was 1108 yuan. Buyers in the market showed little interest. Dealers from Tianjin sold approximately 2,000 taels to fellow dealers, including Tongfeng, Yongdafeng, Hengyingfeng, and Heng, and the market weakened afterward. It was difficult to sell at 1105 yuan. The swap situation was tepid, with very few official transactions. There were 1225 outstanding strips for the current month and 4508 strips for December.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were still active.

<p>Yesterday, the market prices on the Chinese Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly, with frequent changes. Because it was the last day of this month's futures, there were still many unsettled chips on both the long and short sides. After several days of squeezing the shorts, there was a rumor that Fujian and Guangdong had already made contact, so the war in Zhejiang Province might be fortunately avoided. The market gradually began to cover shorts, and market prices rebounded sharply. However, the afternoon news was the opposite, with a slight return, and was again suppressed. Rumors spread frequently in the market, and the bulls became more cautious. For the future situation, war could not be avoided, but whether Guangdong Province could join forces with the central government to jointly resist Fujian was still doubtful, and whether welcoming Hu Renjing to Beijing could achieve its purpose was also uncertain. The market price changes were still in full swing. Yesterday morning, the market opened with slightly positive news, because there was a rumor that Fujian and Guangdong had already made contact, and if it was only a regional matter, Zhejiang Province could be fortunately avoided. The market's short covering gradually began, and the initial auctions showed some confusion, but after entering the market, they gradually became consistent, so they all rose by 3 or 4 jiao. In the next round, the shorts quite covered, short swaps were also common, and arbitrage transactions were also not uncommon, consistently rising by another 3 or 4 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. The situation seemed to have turned. In the afternoon, another round was done, and swap transactions still poured in. Market prices continued to be good for another 2 or 3 jiao. The 19th level continued to be good for 6 and a half jiao. After entering the market and auctioning at the 20th level, the news turned bad again, and large players gradually began to sell, becoming more and more afterward, so the downtrend turned sharply. The entire 6 suddenly fell by 8 and a half jiao. This kind of abnormal rise and fall was still dominated by the environment, and the emptiness of people's hearts could be seen here. As a result, market prices generally rose by 2 or 3 jiao to 7 or 8 jiao, only the entire 696 and Jin Chang fell by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. The total turnover was 19,967,000 yuan, of which 7,000 yuan was spot, 7,835,000 yuan was futures salt tax, 3,050,000 yuan was troop reduction, 1,995,000 yuan was the 19th level good, 3,080,000 yuan was the 20th round and 20th, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>The Xinfeng Yangxing reported that the New York stock market rose slightly on the 24th. The selling side had dumped too much, and the technical position improved. At the same time, the report stated that the government might change its attitude towards public utilities. Public utility stocks were therefore very strong. The USD was strong because government bonds were slightly firm, and the momentum of the anti-inflation faction was growing. Democratic Party leader Al Smith supported restoring the Cha standard. However, the stock market was not affected. The situation seemed to be slightly higher. The total daily turnover was 1.42 million shares. "Wheat" buyers gradually increased, and the selling trend seemed to be gradually stopping. If the currency problem has a clear explanation, the price should advance. "Cotton" December futures have clearly settled a lot, and other periods have also recently sold. The market position is slightly better than before, and should be able to influence the announcement of the currency stability that the public expects. The price of gold purchased by Financial Shanshe per tael was 33.76 yuan, unchanged. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing price Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>Thirty industrial stocks 99.52 Up 0.95</p>
<p>Twenty railroad stocks 39.55 Up 0.66</p>

<p>The yarn market is very tired, and the downtrend is particularly strong. The long positions of a certain factory included a portion that sold off during the rise. At the same time, the actual demand in the market was slow, and all gangs had no intention of doing anything. Therefore, the downtrend rose sharply. The near month fell by 2 yuan 1 jiao, to 1 yuan 8 jiao. However, a certain association maintained the amount of absorption and firmly refused to release it. In short, current sales are too light, and it is fundamentally difficult to stabilize.</p>

The near month fell by 1 yuan 7 jiao, and the far month fell by 1.3.5.6 jiao. The afternoon situation was still weak, and each month fell by another 1 yuan 2 jiao to 4.5.6.8 jiao.

<p>The cotton market is trending weakly, and the downtrend is gradually rising. There was a risk of a decline in this month's early days, but it was tightly held by general cotton merchants, so the market prices of foreign cotton and spot goods stepped down. Local cotton was still stable and motionless. Unexpectedly, today is the last day of this month, and deliveries are not active, falling alone by 1 yuan 6 jiao half. The future is still difficult to be optimistic. However, some people are still buying and going long. The last round of this month broke through the 40 yuan mark, discovering this year's new low peak, 39 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Far Month Cotton Is Still Planted <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The Zheng standard market opened in the early market, and there were not many buyers in the market. However, the market atmosphere for the far month was still strong. The near fell by 3 jiao half, and the far fell by 5 points to 1 jiao. In the afternoon, the board for this month tended to decline, falling by 1 yuan 3 jiao, and the far fell by 2 jiao half. The total daily turnover was 154,200 dan.

<p>Yesterday's US cotton market started with a decline due to pressure from the selling side, and then rose due to spot merchants buying and short covering. As a result, spot goods rose by 10 pounds, and futures rose by 6 pounds to 10 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot goods remained unchanged, futures rose by 45 points, Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 10 points, and the Mumbai cotton market was calm and unremarkable. As a result, Pingal fell by 2.5 rupees, Aomra fell by 1.5 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is as follows (telegram of the 24th):</p>

<p>After the morning opening, the flour market showed a continuation of the previous declines in all months.  Overseas wheat prices, such as those from Chicago, rebounded by 3-4 jiao, and Canadian wheat rose by about 1 jiao. Coupled with positive sentiment from outside the industry, the market remained bullish, with near-term contracts rising another 1 fen and longer-term contracts rising about 2 fen.  However, after the third trading session, the market saw renewed volatility as government wheat trading houses offered wheat for sale, still quoting 4.2 yuan.  Additionally, there were rumors that the tax increase issue was not guaranteed. As a result, confidence weakened, and selling pressure increased significantly.  During the afternoon opening, market sentiment remained poor in the first two sessions. However, in the third session, rumors resurfaced that the tax increase would eventually be implemented, causing confidence to rebound. Currently, the flour market has become increasingly speculative, with both sides relying on news to determine their positions.  Recent actual sales have not been as strong as before, and market sentiment is constantly fluctuating.  As a result, the current month contract fell by 0.5 li compared to the previous day, December fell by 1 fen, January fell by 1.5 fen, February fell by 0.25 li, March remained unchanged, and April rose by 0.5 li.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month initially showed a bullish trend but subsequently plummeted.  Overseas wheat prices rebounded by 1 jiao to 3-4 jiao, so initially, market sentiment remained stable, and prices rose by 1-2 fen compared to the previous day.  However, after the close, as the flour market weakened, market sentiment became somewhat fragile, and prices fell by 2-3 fen from their peak.  During the afternoon opening, since the current month was the last trading day, both buyers and sellers needed to settle their positions, with approximately 50 carloads of actual delivery.  Furthermore, the tax increase issue was not as severe as rumored, and whether it would be implemented in the future remained uncertain, leading to strong selling pressure and a step-by-step decline in the market.  This situation was purely driven by news, and the future is likely to see many changes. As a result, the current month contract fell by 2 fen, December fell by 7 fen, January and February fell by 8 fen, and March fell by 6 fen. Spot wheat trading was quiet due to both arrival and sales being weak, so there was no trading.</p>
<h3 id="e252">River Rice Arrivals Surge, Prices Fall by 2 Jiao <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, arrivals were relatively abundant, with over 70 boats from various groups arriving, totaling over 8,000 shi of goods. Late rice accounted for about 40% (over 5,000 shi), while thick japonica, Du Yangjian, and other varieties made up the remainder (approximately 3,000 shi).  Regarding the late rice market, after a weakening trend yesterday afternoon, the market showed sluggishness right from the opening today. Coupled with the abundant arrivals, it became even more depressed.  At that time, buyers from other provinces were hesitant and unsure, seeming to halt trading.  Seeing this, sellers urgently sought to rescue the situation by loudly lowering prices and opportunistically selling off their stocks.  After this round of price cuts, buyers finally began to purchase. As a result, buyers from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other provinces purchased over 5,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songsongsi, and other late rice varieties, but prices had already fallen by 2 jiao.  Although the demand for japonica rice from Changzhou, Suzhou, Tongzhou, and Nangang was slightly better, it was affected by the price of late rice and also fell by 1-2 jiao. Du Yangjian rice prices also softened by several fen.  Although the Yin Yuan distilleries were still active, prices were reduced by about 1 jiao due to the relatively large arrivals.  Bian Yuan rice was unaffected.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were 45-46 arrivals from various routes on the river.  Sales in the market were sluggish. Prices for new japonica, Du Jian, and thin rice fell slightly by about 1 jiao.  Yang Jian and Bu Jian prices showed a weak trend.  The price of Bai Yuan early rice for Ke Jian remained stable.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Group Also Considering Further Purchases Next Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer indica rice market was active for both local and out-of-town buyers. Since the price of customer indica rice fell, there were frequent direct purchases from trading firms, and customer ground rice was especially welcomed.  Demand was strong yesterday, with 300 bags of Wuhu ground rice sold at 8.15 yuan, 300 bags of Wuxi ground rice sold at 8.37 yuan, then at 8.32 yuan, 405 bags of Jiangxi ground rice sold at 8.12 yuan, then at 8.05 yuan, and 68 bags of ground early rice sold at 6.32 yuan.  The Quanzhou group's demand was particularly strong, purchasing 590 bags of Jiangxi ground late rice, 300 bags of Jiangbei ground rice, 500 bags of Nanjing ground rice, and 146 bags of Wuxi ground rice.  The Beiyang group purchased 250 bags of Hunan Jinxian.  Shantou and Xiamen purchased 500 bags of Nanjing indica rice.  The price of customer indica rice did not fluctuate, while the price of ground rice rose slightly. Furthermore, there is a great need for rice in the Fuzhou area, and after several days of suspending purchases, market prices have soared. Therefore, the Guan group came to inquire about prices yesterday and will likely resume shipments by the middle of next week.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Green Beans Sold As Soon As They Arrive <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The sales of green beans are still active, and the source of goods is not abundant. As soon as they arrive, they are sold, so the market is quite stable. Yesterday, 350 bags of Gaoyou green beans were sold at prices ranging from 3.91 yuan to 3.72 yuan. Additionally, 100 bags of Liuhe green beans were sold at 3.6 yuan, and 250 bags of Lu Jin green beans were sold at 3.7 yuan, all destined for inland Zhejiang routes. There is also strong demand for these beans in Fuzhou, but the situation is affected by the current political climate.</p>

<p>Recently, the arrival of dried shrimp from various dealers has been quite abundant, but the sales to customers have been slow, leading to a decline in the market. Yesterday, the listed prices were lowered. High-quality Jin Gouwei (Golden Hook Tail) was priced at 112 yuan, ordinary quality at 110 yuan, and lower quality down to 105 yuan. The sales of Jin Shanwei (Golden Mountain Tail) were even scarcer, with listed prices reluctantly opened at 122 yuan, but no buyers were found. Seven pieces of Long Yawei (Dragon Tooth Tail) were offered at prices ranging from 72 yuan to 63.8 yuan. Tian Bianwei (Field Flat Tail) was listed at 92-93 yuan, but there were no sales. According to industry insiders, the market is expected to decline further.</p>

<p>New York Raw Silk Prices Hit New Lows Due to accumulated silk stocks and sluggish factory sales in the New York raw silk market, coupled with aggressive price-cutting sales of Japanese silk, spot silk prices have hit new lows. The price of standard Japanese silk (used by the New York Raw Silk Exchange as the auction standard) has fallen below the US$1.30 per pound mark. Converted to Chinese currency, the price per bale is only over 430 yuan. As a result, the New York telegram stated that the price of B-grade white factory silk was only around 500 yuan. Sales of Chinese silk in the US have reached a state of despair.</p>
<p>Shipments of Chinese Silk to the US Have Completely Halted The sales of Chinese silk in the US have plummeted. Since autumn, American firms have lacked significant silk purchases. As a result, shipments of Japanese silk to the US have become increasingly scarce. Recently, they have completely halted. This week, not a single bale of Chinese silk was shipped to the US. Last week, only 15 bales of factory silk were shipped to New York via Lianna.</p>
<p>Sales of Artificial Silk to Customers are Lifeless Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have made the quoted prices of artificial silk unstable, and sales to customers are lifeless. Yesterday, only silk merchants from Nanxun, Zhenze, and other places purchased 15 cases of Shuang Meiren, Ai Kef, and other brands of raw material spot and forward goods, priced at 172.5 yuan to 161.75 yuan net. There were no purchases of forward goods.</p>
<p>Overseas Firms Not Interested in Forward or Spot Silk The overseas silk market has shown a state of collapse. Japanese silk is being actively devalued and sold at low prices, repeatedly reaching new lows. Shanghai Chinese silk telegrams are not being forwarded, and no one is interested in forward or spot silk. Furthermore, yesterday was Saturday, with only half a day of trading in the morning. Silk sales completely stopped, and the future is increasingly bleak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to horse racing on Saturday, negotiations between British firms in the local tea market were completely halted. Only the Fu Chang Foreign Firm, a white tea merchant, purchased 64 boxes of local Zhumu tea for 66 to 68 yuan, with little change from the previous day. There were no transactions for other goods such as Zhenmei and Xiumei. The market was very sparse.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Metals: US Tinplate Fixed Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Since the Min Bureau experienced changes, the local metals market has shown signs of decline. The credit crunch and the sudden stagnation of sales to customers have brought the entire market to a near standstill. Although the tea conferences provide some activity, the number of deals is small and insufficient to stimulate the market. As a result, prices have generally fallen. Flat iron, corrugated iron, English iron sheets, new iron wire, and new steel wire have all declined. Fortunately, the declines have been slight. However, overseas fixed prices have generally risen. The rise in prices is most pronounced for US tinplate. Over the past few days, there have been continuous reports of rising prices. The following are the prices received from New York yesterday:</p>
<p>Type Price per box</p>
<p>90 lb uncoated single sheet US$3.98</p>
<p>90 lb coated single sheet US$4.22</p>
<p>100 lb uncoated single sheet US$4.25</p>

<p>Transactions in pure antimony have been quiet for a long time. There has been no news to report about buying and selling in the market for many days. However, the ordnance factory purchased more than twenty tons the day before yesterday, reducing the spot supply in the market and causing the standard price to rise slightly. The quoted price is 308 yuan per ton, up 3 yuan from before.</p>

<h3 id="e260">On Kicking Butts <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Chinese society has only two classes: those who kick other people's butts and those who prepare their butts to be kicked. Studying and going to school is the path to kicking other people's butts in the future. (See "Life" Magazine, Volume 1, Issue 1, "Da Sheng" article)</p>
<p>The same butt is more honored when kicked by a foreigner than by a compatriot. The same foot kicks harder when kicking a compatriot than when kicking a foreigner.</p>
<p>Those whose butts are kicked by foreigners often boast to those whose butts are kicked by compatriots. Those whose butts are kicked by compatriots often express admiration to those whose butts are kicked by foreigners, saying, "Why am I lagging behind?"</p>
<p>Slaves are best at offering their butts and are also best at kicking other people's butts once they gain power.</p>
<p>The Confucian concept of "positioning" is to tell those who kick butts to kick with confidence and those whose butts are kicked to accept it peacefully. But the idea of "peaceful acceptance" is always somewhat insufficient, so it must be supplemented by the Taoist concept of "being a ravine to the world," which involves both passive and active aspects. "Peaceful acceptance" is just that, passively waiting for a time when it is no longer necessary to be accepting, and it is not satisfaction. Being a ravine to the world, one's enduring virtue never leaves, because taking a lower position is seen as gaining power and having one's butt kicked is seen as a pleasure. Therefore, Chinese people believe in Confucianism when they are successful, seeing kicking others' butts as acting on behalf of heaven, and they believe in Lao-Zhuang when they are unsuccessful, seeing having their butts kicked as receiving from heaven. Thus, Chinese people deeply appreciate the beauty of the court when they are successful and deeply appreciate the beauty of the mountains and forests when they are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>When two children fight in an alley, the one with the bigger fist believes in Confucianism, and the one with the smaller fist believes in Taoism.</p>
<p>There is a genius for kicking butts and an inherent nature for offering butts. A genius who should be kicking other people's butts but suddenly encounters butts that refuse to be kicked has no room to display their talent and will inevitably scold the person in question. A person with an inherent nature to offer their butt in hopes of being kicked but cannot find an owner will inevitably drink wine and write poetry, lamenting their misfortune.</p>
<p>Those who kick others' butts usually want others to kick their own butts, as long as they believe that the other person has the status and good fortune to kick other people's butts. Yamen runners, low-level servants, gatekeepers, soldiers, politicians, and bureaucrats all simultaneously engage in kicking butts and offering butts.</p>
<p>In a country of ruler-ruler, minister-minister, father-father, and son-son, when the world is in order, the emperor kicks the empress's butt, the empress kicks the eunuch's butt, the eunuch kicks the minister's butt, the minister kicks the governor's butt, the governor kicks the prefect's butt, and the prefect kicks the commoner's butt. Assuming that everyone from the emperor to the commoner adheres to their position, follows the way without exceeding the bounds, and is kicked and kicks others, then the division of roles is defined, personal life is settled, the family is cultivated, the state is governed, and the world is at peace. When the world is out of order, the eunuch is kicked by the emperor and complains to the empress, and the empress kicks the emperor's butt instead. Thus, the superiors follow suit, and the commoner kicks the prefect's butt, the prefect kicks the governor's butt... This is called the decline of morality, great chaos in the world, the people rebel, and revolutionary parties appear.</p>
<p>Young people like to overthrow others and kick the butts of those who kick them. Older, more mature people do the opposite, showing restraint, because experience, knowledge, and worldliness tell them that rebelling against the kicker goes against heaven and often leads to a bloody end or, at the very least, a life of neglect. Submitting to the kicker is conforming to heaven, and conforming to heaven brings wealth, promotion, and a life of sitting on soft cushions and sofas.</p>
<p>When writers and politicians are unsuccessful, they often speak out on behalf of the small people whose butts are being kicked, arguing that butts should not be kicked, in accordance with the spirit of democracy. When they are successful, they argue that all butts should be kicked, in accordance with the aim of maintaining social order.</p>
<p>Scholars kick the butts of commoners, and soldiers then kick the butts of scholars. After writers and politicians come to power, they argue that all butts must be kicked by them, for the public good or for private gain, and they have no choice but to sacrifice themselves and serve the country. Soon, the soldiers kick them down and also praise, "That kick was well done!" But soon after, they argue that kicking butts violates the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>There is a step in the process of moving from being kicked passively to kicking actively, called "touching." But anyone who touches Zhao Meng's butt will give Zhao Meng the right to kick their butt.</p>
<p>Those who like to kick butts are also distinguished by whether they cry out in pain when they are kicked. Those who are kicked and do not cry out in pain are said to be "restrained," while those who cry out in pain are said to "not know how to appreciate kindness." In China, a butt that is afraid of being kicked, or cries out in pain when kicked, can it still be considered a butt?</p>
<p>Spartan children also practiced not crying out in pain when their butts were beaten. But the situation is different from that in China. Spartans practiced not crying out in pain, not being kicked by the enemy, and at the same time practiced kicking back. Because the Spartans were brave and good at fighting, they were also good at kicking the butts of the Athenians. The philosophy of kicking butts has deeply penetrated the psychology of our people, and it will take a hundred years to eradicate it.</p>
<h3 id="e261">A Collection of Melodies and a Confucian Collection <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Literati in the Ming Dynasty were fond of melodies, and even pure Confucian scholars were fond of them. Wang Shouren would occasionally write a loose melody, and Qiu Jun devoted himself to writing legends, with four types: Five Relationships Complete, Throwing the Pen, Lifting the Tripod, and Luo Nang. Some criticized him for being a great Confucian scholar and should not pay attention to operas, but he regarded them as enemies. One day, he passed a temple and saw a story painted on the walls. He couldn't help but be surprised and asked a monk, "How could there be this in an empty door?" The monk replied, "The old monk enlightened to Zen here." The Confucian scholar used opera to preach, and the old monk enlightened to Zen from The Romance of the Western Chamber. This is truly worthy of exclamation. Jiao Xun's Play Theory says, "According to legend, at the end of the Hongzhi period of the Ming Dynasty, a certain professor of the Quanzhou Prefecture School, a native of Nanhai, was quite aloof. One day, he held a banquet in the Minglun Hall and performed The Romance of the Western Chamber. The next day, an anonymous person wrote a couplet on the school gate, 'Unhappy for literature, the Nanhai gentleman came to the Minglun Hall; the school has no light, the Romance of the Western Chamber was performed in the professor's hall.' When he came out and saw it, he was ashamed and his old ways disappeared." Was it only the Confucian scholars who did this? Even the classical Chinese style of writing, which carries the Dao, was fond of The Romance of the Western Chamber. The same book also says: "Tang Jingchuan wrote after being half drunk. First, he sang the passage from The Romance of the Western Chamber in which Huiming did not recite the Lotus Sutra, danced and stretched out paper to write, and the text was completed. See Sixteen Views on Writing". Even those who call themselves disciples of the sage are like this, so it is no wonder that other literati are fond of music, whether it is only for enjoyment or creation. The Ming government was harsh and there were many taboos. Hiding in opera was also a way for literati to avoid disaster, and the opera was very prosperous in the Ming Dynasty. Lu Tiancheng's preface to Melody Grades says, "I liked melodies when I was dancing as a child, and I liked filling in lyrics when I was weak. Every time I went to the market and saw a legend, I would take it home, and my basket gradually filled up. At first, I wanted to build a collection of melodies, from the creations of talented predecessors to the compilations of corrupt Confucian scholars, and collect them all, making a grand view of the rivers and seas. But then I said that there were too many to collect, and the compilations would soil my collection, so I lost them one by one." It is a pity that no one in the Ming Dynasty was willing to create a collection of melodies. Otherwise, Wu Mei, Zheng Zhenduo and others today would not have to exhaust their efforts in searching for lost melodies. How can one boast of quantity and compete for knowledge?</p>
<p>Cao Xueqin of the Ming Dynasty once said that the two families of Taoism and Buddhism have collections, so why don't we Confucian scholars have them? He wanted to create a Confucian collection to stand alongside the Taoist and Buddhist collections. Therefore, he collected books from the Siku Quanshu and divided them into categories. After more than ten years, the work was not completed and the two capitals were lost. It is a pity that the Confucian collection was never completed. Otherwise, to this day, the Taoist and Buddhist collections have been published, and now the rare books of the Siku Quanshu are being reprinted. It can be seen that the disciples of the sage have not disappeared, and that the inherent culture is waiting to be explained. How do we know that no one will reprint the Confucian collection?</p>
<h3 id="e262">In Harbin <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>By an unexpected chance, I met three people who split wood.</p>
<p>Originally, in the streets of Harbin, there were many people like them. They were always in groups of three or four, carrying axes and saws, soliciting business, splitting wood for people.</p>
<p>They walked the streets every day, only fearing that rainy days were their days of rest.</p>
<p>The three people I knew were all from Shandong. In fact, only Shandong people could do such heavy work. No matter how others called them coolies, I respected them as the "pillars of society."</p>
<p>Afterwards, every day at the same time, I would see them three, walking at a sparse pace, carrying axes and saws, appearing on the street where I lived. They would greet each other, and they all had an unspeakable joy. I saw that they were somewhat different from others, but I couldn't say what it was. Because of this, it aroused my concern and affection for them.</p>
<p>We became close friends, and we talked about things that only close friends could talk about. They knew that I was a young student who had returned to the north from the south. Although they didn't know what I did, they worried about me. They sincerely advised me to be very careful when speaking to outsiders, because there were as many secret agents in the city as ants on the ground. At the same time, they honestly and sincerely told me about their past, so that I knew that a year ago they were farmers from the Fujin area of ​​the Lower River, with many people in their families. Later, they joined a gang and became guerrillas. Later, they were scattered, but they did not easily forget that scattering. That was the most fierce bloody battle between them and the Japanese soldiers, with more than 2,000 people, when the Japanese soldiers truly died more than 200 people under their blades. Later, a great flood occurred in the river. After the flood, there was no food to eat, no houses to live in, and no land to cultivate, so they came to this city to seek a life.</p>
<p>At that time, I asked:</p>
<p>"Why don't you do it again?"</p>
<p>They didn't answer me, just looked at me and smiled. I knew there was a hidden story in this, so I changed the subject.</p>
<p>In the streets of Harbin, especially in the Nangang and Majiagou areas, some streets often extend from all directions and intersect at one place, and then they go to different places. There will inevitably be a small garden at the intersection, with ancient plums planted and benches placed in the shade of the trees. Every day at noon, unable to withstand the scorching heat, I would take a paper fan and go to that kind of place to escape the heat. Sitting on the bench, I would accept the cool breeze blowing from all the street entrances; I would listen to the little birds singing in the treetops; the lazy sound of horses' hooves and the rumbling of big cars on the street allowed me to find tranquility in the hustle and bustle. After a while, I would unknowingly lie down on the bench and fall asleep.</p>
<p>That day, at the same time, I went to the shade of the trees to escape the heat again. After sitting down, I suddenly remembered that I hadn't seen my three close friends for several days. But then I thought: Maybe they went to "Daoli," "Daowai," or those places in Majiagou to solicit business.</p>
<p>However, I was wrong after all. One day in the evening, when I had just walked to the trolleybus, I saw a group of prisoners walking in front of me, under police surveillance, wearing handcuffs. They looked like just some coolies. What crimes could they have committed? But suddenly, I saw them three in the crowd! After not seeing you for a few days, you have committed illegal things? I thought.</p>
<p>From the discussions of the people watching the excitement on the roadside, I learned that they were all criminals who had been arrested for "endangering the new country." They were plainclothes soldiers of the volunteer army, planning to riot in the city. Originally, these irresponsible words could be ignored, but at this moment, I felt that it was almost the same, because I remembered the differences between my three friends and others, and their past of not answering my questions and just smiling at me. This is naturally a serious issue, but I hope they regain their freedom soon.</p>
<p>They also saw me, with that kind of laughter full on their faces, which probably only true anti-Japanese soldiers who are not afraid of death can have.</p>
<p>I smiled back at them, a bitter smile more bitter than coptis chinensis.</p>

<p>— Written by Thoreau, Translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>(1) Speculation with Pebbles</p>
<p>In the town there was a road covered in pebbles. A passing car kicked one of the pebbles out. This pebble spoke to itself: "Why should I be stuck here tightly squeezed among many of my kind? I would rather live alone."</p>
<p>A child passed by and picked up the pebble.</p>
<p>The pebble thought in its heart, "I want to travel, so I will travel. All I need is a strong and full desire."</p>
<p>The child threw it towards a house. The pebble thought again, "I want to fly, so I will fly. It's very simple - I just need to wish it so."</p>
<p>With a "bang," the pebble went through a glass window. The glass shattered, and cried out:</p>
<p>"Oh, you wicked thing! What are you doing?"</p>
<p>But the pebble replied:</p>
<p>"If you had given way in advance, this wouldn't have happened. I don't want anyone blocking my way. Everything must be arranged for my benefit - that's my motto."</p>
<p>The pebble landed on a soft bed and thought, "I've been flying for a while, now I want to rest for a bit."</p>
<p>A servant came in, picked the pebble up from the bed, and threw it back out the window, so it was lying on the pebble road again.</p>
<p>So the pebble cried out to its kind: "Brothers, how are you? I just visited a mansion, but I don't like the nobles at all. My heart yearns for the masses, so I'm back again."</p>
<h3 id="e264">Two Brothers (40) <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>So, this young, free, wealthy man, prepared to dedicate himself to all tender Marias, one day happened to walk into a small shop, perhaps noticing the beautiful shopkeeper. He bought something. He came again later. He started chatting with them, becoming more familiar day by day. He often came to buy something, so as to have the right to sit in their house, laugh with the young woman, and shake hands with her husband.</p>
<p>And then… and then… ah! Heavens… and then…?</p>
<p>He had loved and caressed the first child, the jeweler's child, and when the other child was born, he kept his secret silent until death. Then, his grave was sealed, his flesh decayed, his name was no longer mentioned, and he disappeared forever. He no longer needed to worry, fear, or hide, and he left all his property to the second child! … Why? … He was a clever man… he should have understood and anticipated that he would almost inevitably lead people to suspect that this child was his. Then wasn't he ruining a woman's reputation? If Zhean wasn't his son, how could he have done such a thing?</p>
<p>Suddenly, a clear, horrifying memory surfaced in Pierre's mind. Maria had golden hair, and Zhean also had golden hair. He now remembered a small portrait he had seen when he lived in Paris, placed on the mantelpiece in the living room. This portrait was now gone. Where had it gone? Was it lost, or hidden? Ah! If only he could hold it in his hand for a second! Perhaps his mother had hidden it in a secret drawer, the kind specifically for keeping love tokens.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, he became extremely agitated and involuntarily let out a sigh, a short sigh forced out by intense pain. Suddenly, the sirens on the embankment, as if hearing his sigh, as if understanding his sigh and responding to it, roared beside him. This supernatural monster's cry, louder than thunder, this roar that could overwhelm the sound of the wind and the waves, spread through the darkness of the invisible sea shrouded in fog.</p>
<p>Then, similar sounds, through the fog, from near and far, rose again from the darkness. These cries emitted by blind ocean liners sounded terrifying.</p>
<p>Then everything was silent again.</p>
<p>Pierre opened his eyes and looked around, surprised that he was in that place. He had awakened from a nightmare.</p>
<p>"I'm crazy, I'm suspecting my mother," he lamented. Then his heart was filled with filial piety, emotion, regret, prayer, and sorrow. His mother! He understood her now as he always had. How could he doubt her? Wasn't the soul and life of this simple, chaste, upright woman clearer than water? Who, having seen and known her, could not think that she was beyond suspicion? And now it was he, her son, who was doubting her! If he could take her into his arms at that moment, how he would hug and kiss her, comfort her, how he would kneel before her and beg her forgiveness!</p>

<h3 id="e265">Special Issue on Basic English Studies: Understanding Basic English <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>Shanghai is one of the largest international commercial centers in the world today. The application of foreign languages is more urgent and necessary here than in any other place in China. Among foreign languages, English is the most fashionable, so there are more people learning English than any other foreign language, which is a natural phenomenon. However, although the need for English is urgent, the difficulties and time required to learn English cannot be reduced. This is the most difficult thing for beginners, especially those who only have the opportunity to learn English as adults. Suddenly, we hear about the invention of Basic English, which only requires learning 850 words to handle ordinary conversations. This should be a happy thing for friends who have wanted to learn English but don't have a lot of time and money to spend. Who knew that this excessive expectation would soon be greatly disappointed, because the number of words in Basic English is too small to handle even ordinary elementary school conversations. Using it to handle complex commercial Q&amp;A will naturally be full of jokes and not be considered language. At the same time, a group of teachers who speak English well launched a major attack, using sarcasm and abuse to the extreme. As a result, many people who urgently wanted to learn English were disappointed, and the promoters were inevitably discouraged. Because this publication has received many articles discussing this issue, and many readers have written to request answers to this question, although this publication has previously published several articles, there are still many manuscripts in storage. Therefore, it was decided to publish this special issue. But our attitude is impartial. We will publish all the submitted articles as much as possible without prejudice, hoping that readers can understand this.</p>
<p>In the text of this special issue, there is no doubt that critical arguments occupy an absolute majority. The reporter has stated in advance that he does not want to take sides, so he will not participate in any opinions. However, I deeply feel that there is one point we should recognize about Basic English, that English is still one of the most universally applicable languages among foreign languages in the world today. Let's put aside the nationality of Basic English and only talk about the purpose of the inventor of Basic English. I think at least part of it is to reduce the difficulty of learning English and to use the existing position of English for more widespread application. This motive is what we should understand. Because to learn a language, you must have opportunities to practice it often, so that it is not easy to forget. English at least occupies a superior position in this respect, and Basic English is nothing more than a product based on this point. To be fair, the biggest shortcoming of Basic English is that there are too few words. If the inventor can revise and supplement it based on facts, then its future is still unlimited. We hope that readers will not completely dismiss its value because of the harshness of the critics. You should know that when a new thing comes out, severe criticism is always unavoidable. But its final victory depends entirely on whether the inventor and those who sympathize with it can humbly accept criticism, examine the opinions of the critics, and improve it. This is the general principle of creating a new business. We should also use this as a basis for predicting the future of Basic English.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter has one more suggestion to the inventor of Basic English, that I deeply believe that even if the number of words in Basic English becomes "1850 words," it is still easy to learn and can still be called Basic English. Then, I think the jokes will be much less than with "850 words."</p>
<h3 id="e266">A General Discussion of the Structure of Basic English <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Shi An</p>
<p>What exactly is Basic English? This is what I want to study with the readers of this publication now.</p>
<p>First, Basic English is not something that can be easily learned in a few months, as some people say. Its shortcomings are exactly the same as those of Standard English. For example, troublesome spelling, irregular verb conjugations, and unreasonable idioms are all copied directly from Standard English. These points are the most difficult for learners in Standard English. It is clearly impossible to say that they will suddenly become easier in Basic English.</p>
<p>Second, Basic English is full of weirdness and clumsiness, and it does not conform to the rules of language at all. Part of its content is completely different from Standard English, which is what Ogden and others boast about as the characteristic of Basic English, but it is also the most difficult and lacking part of it. This is because many words that are necessary in our daily life are discarded, leaving only 850 words to take on the functions of thousands of words. There are more than dozens of the most basic and common human actions every day, from getting up to going to bed, but Basic English only has eighteen verbs. Therefore, when you run, you can't say "run" (Run), you can only say "go quickly" (Go Quickly); to shave, you can only say "take away the hair on the face." This kind of statement fully exposes the poverty of expression. Just imagine, if you learn Basic English and you can't even distinguish between running and walking, and you can't shave clearly, how can you handle negotiations with others properly? If you use Basic English to express your thoughts, can you be sure that you will not be misunderstood?</p>
<p>The content of human life and the interaction between people are becoming richer and more complex day by day, adapting to the development of social productivity. Since the scope of our activities is getting larger, the language used to express thoughts also becomes richer to meet practical needs. Basic English only leaves us with eighteen verbs, which is to make the language regress from rich to poor, clearly violating the law of language evolution and engaging in an act of reversing the language.</p>
<p>Furthermore, nouns are even more difficult to remember and clumsy. Language is a tool for humans to communicate thoughts, so its most basic condition is that people understand it when it is spoken. If only you understand it, then it is not human speech. In Basic English, there are most of the words that are very incomprehensible and only you can understand. For example, Standard English says that an onion is Onion, which is very simple and clear, but Basic English simply doesn't want it, and insists on using "a white root that makes the eyes water" instead. This kind of roundabout talk is not liked by the British themselves (please refer to the British criticism of Basic English in the Daily International Anthology).</p>
<h3 id="e267">Announcement from this Publication <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Since this publication published several articles on Basic English and Esperanto studies in previous issues, we have recently received many manuscripts of the same nature, while manuscripts of other natures are very scarce. Therefore, in addition to publishing a "Special Issue on Basic English Studies" in this issue, we plan to publish a "Special Issue on Esperanto Studies" in the next issue. We hereby announce this in advance.</p>
<p>Chinese people who learn ordinary English also "hate" it very much (see Mr. Lin Yutang's article), because it is very difficult to remember and easy to misunderstand. An onion is indeed "a white root that makes the eyes water," and the "spicy vegetable" commonly seen in our villages is also a genuine "white root" that can also "make the eyes water." This kind of heaven-knows gibberish is simply not qualified to be a language.</p>
<p>Roundabout speech is the specialty of people with a low degree of change and small talk. When people in the countryside of the interior see a car for the first time, they say it is "something with four round feet running and roaring": children who don't understand glasses say "circles on the eyes." So Basic English is not a new invention of Ogden, but just learning from children and people with very low cultural standards, imitating their way of expressing thoughts.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>methods of expressing thoughts. However, after seeing "something with four round feet running and roaring" twice, people in the interior countryside gradually know to call it "car." Once told by their fathers or mothers, children will also call a circle on the eyes "glasses." But our Chinese scholars and editors are still reversing the trend, treating barbaric expressions as rare commodities and considering them a new invention of the twentieth century. Isn't this a joke?</p>
<h3 id="e268">Talking About the Characteristics of Basic English Grammar <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shiyin</p>
<p>According to page 130 of "Introduction," the grammar of Basic English has two characteristics, namely: (1) Other national languages (including ordinary English) all have lengthy verb conjugation tables. These changes cannot be learned well in a few years. Basic English only needs to memorize one verb conjugation table. (2) Even Esperanto, which is most supported, has at least 500 rules for the endings of related words. Basic English is not like that. But if we know that the total number of rules in "Esperanto" Esperanto is only sixteen, and only the sixth rule talks about verb changes, it is more reasonable and simpler than the verb conjugation table of Basic English.</p>
<p>The compound nouns and prefixes and suffixes, which are exclaimed by the promoters of Chinese Basic English as the most ingenious features, are actually shallow and poor.</p>
<p>The so-called compound nouns are either formed by the combination of two nouns, or by the combination of a noun and a direction noun, always limited to those in Standard English (see page 31 of "Grammar"). In this way, it is limited to 600 nouns and 20 direction nouns (prepositions). Although some other types of words can exceptionally be joined together in pairs to form a new word, its meaning is completely new and cannot be known at a glance (see page 102 of "Introduction"). In Esperanto, all words can be combined with each other to form new words, as long as they are logical, called combined words.</p>
<p>As for prefixes, in Basic English, most of the fifty adjectives of nature use un to express the meaning of "opposite" (see page 65 of "Grammar"). The twenty prepositions of Basic English can also be used as quasi-prefixes and added before ten simple verbs to form new verbs (see page 75 of "Introduction"). But this is such a narrow range. Not only have the 850 words already taken away the lively life of prefixes, but the number of prefixes is simply too small. In Esperanto, there are nine prefixes, forty quasi-prefixes, one special prefix, and five other prefixes in academia, so that the vocabulary does not have to be clumsily, unscientifically, and anti-evolutionarily limited to 850 words and can be lively improved. For example, if the prefix in Esperanto that expresses the meaning of "opposite" is mal, then in the twenty-five pairs of opposite adjectives on page 3617 of "Introduction," a large part of them would not need to use words with completely different forms in Esperanto.</p>
<p>There are only four things in Basic English that can barely be called suffixes: er·or·ing·ed. In fact, or is an exception of er, and adding ing can be transformed into a noun, or it can be used as an adjective, just like ed, which is just the ending of a grammatical part of speech. However, the classification of parts of speech in Esperanto is clearly stipulated with endings, so that there will be no confusion like the two Buildings in Abuilderisbuildingabuilding. Although it is easy to distinguish in this simplest sentence, Esperanto has twenty-nine suffixes, four quasi-suffixes, six special suffixes, and sixteen suffixes in academia. This makes it possible for Esperanto to achieve the goal of reducing the vocabulary and making the language "simplified" and, more importantly, rationalized without violating the principle of the evolution of language and society towards richness and arrogantly limiting the number of words.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how beautifully Basic English is said by some people, it is not as rational and simplified as Esperanto. I think that the promoters of Chinese Basic English should always believe that reducing the vocabulary cannot be achieved by mechanically reducing the number and using the "circumlocution method" (which is actually the method of memorizing dictionaries).</p>
<h3 id="e269">Scientific Language 丨 Basic English <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Guoquan</p>
<p>The development of natural science has shrunk space. In international transportation, we have trains, ships, and even airplanes. But in the spiritual communication of mankind, we still lack a tool. Well, now an international language has appeared, that is, "Basic English," the new invention of Professor Ogden, a language expert at Cambridge University in England!</p>
<p>We all know that English is almost universally spoken, just like the British flag, especially in China and other places in the East. Therefore, adopting English as an international language is really the most appropriate and convenient way. However, English is very difficult to learn, so it is impossible to ask people from all countries to learn English. Professor Ogden saw this point, so he vowed to engage in the work of internationalizing and simplifying English. It took him ten years of hard work to select 850 words from Standard English. It can be seen that this is the crystallization of science.</p>
<p>Because Basic English only has 850 words, it is very easy to learn and can be successful in three months. After learning it, you can speak, write, and write letters, and you can do everything. If you want to study further, you can also use this to study Standard English, so it is also a shortcut to learning Standard English.</p>
<p>This is a newly invented international language. There are still shortcomings in theory and content, but it can be gradually improved. And now there are already more than thirty kinds of Basic English books in the world, and six have been published in China. We can imagine that the number of people learning Basic English all over the world will slowly increase.</p>
<p>The characteristic of Basic English is that it can express everything with a small number of words. However, it is originally impossible to contain all the necessary words in 850 words. Therefore, in Basic English, ten or fewer words are used to explain it. This is the most ingenious part of its organization.</p>
<p>Now, everyone feels the need for an international language. And this Basic English is the best international language. Even if you want to learn English, you should start with Basic English.</p>
<h3 id="e270">On the Practicality of Basic English <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Liren</p>
<p>The promoters of Basic English claim that the 850 words of Basic English "can be used to write or say everything that is necessary in daily life." But how can these mere 850 words express everything in daily life? Therefore, we have to use the method of compiling a dictionary to "explain" the words outside of these 850. But for the person who compiles the dictionary, the purpose is originally to "explain" the meaning of the word. In order to make the meaning of the word clear, it is originally necessary to use dozens or even hundreds of words to "explain" a word. Since Basic English is a kind of language, then the purpose of language is naturally to be able to express one's own meaning smoothly and to be correctly understood by others. The purpose of language is definitely not to "explain," definitely not to compile a dictionary. But Basic English forces people to speak in the tone of compiling a dictionary, which is obviously wrong. When writing an article, if you encounter a word outside of the 850, Ogden teaches us to use footnotes, but when speaking, how do you use footnotes? For example, when we use Basic English to make a phone call, if we encounter a word that is not in the 850, can we say: "Sorry, wait a moment, let me first add a footnote! " And everyone has to carry a pocket-sized "Basic English Dictionary" with them, whether eating or defecating, so that they can look up the footnotes they want at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of hitting a wall at any time. Moreover, this Basic English dictionary, according to the promoters of Chinese Basic English, only has 7,500 words, in other words, only 7,500 "explanations." Then, if you encounter a word outside of the 7,500 (whoever is born into the world will inevitably have this time), how do you "explain" it? Ogden has no way to instruct us, probably "still under study." Never mind, let's leave this point alone. Let's try to see the practicality of this language.</p>
<p>If there is a waiter in a restaurant who is learning Basic English, or a servant in a foreigner's house, he will have to stop doing business with his master sooner or later. Because not only is "onion" "a white root that makes the eyes water," but "waxberry cake" also has to be said to be "a bluish-yellow berry with hair on the skin covered with batter." "Fried flatfish" is called "flatfish with a delicate taste, cooked in oil on the fire." "Cabbage" also has to be said to be "a green plant with a round heart or head." This kind of statement is not only difficult to remember, but no one in the vegetable market or food store will understand it.</p>
<p>If there is a nurse among those who are learning Basic English, her fate is similar to that of the servant. When going out to see a doctor with the doctor, the doctor wants "a kind of pointed tube with a pusher-puller, using air pressure to release water into it, and then release it into a very thin line of water, for medical use." This is the meaning of a "syringe" for injections. Who can remember it exactly? And whether this nurse will be kicked out by the doctor is something we can imagine.</p>
<p>If it is an apprentice in a store, then the difficulties he encounters will be even greater. Not only are there no commonly used words such as "telephone" in the 850 words, which must be learned separately, but when he meets customers, he cannot even say "sir" or "madam" (which are not in the 850 words), and can only directly call them "that man" or "that woman."</p>
<p>Although we are not prophets (according to the tone of Basic English, we should say: "people who talk about future things"), we can guess that Basic English will never</p>
<h3 id="e271">Notice to Unemployed Friends <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>A certain organization plans to hire four outdoor staff members and two trainees, providing food and lodging. Outdoor staff members need to have a high school diploma, be good at communication, have good eloquence, and preferably have some knowledge of ordinary electrical and mechanical engineering. Trainees need to have a junior high school diploma. Applicants should attach a detailed resume and a recent photo and mail them to No. 324, No. 19, Museum Road.</p>
<p>A certain school is recruiting an accounting director to manage the school's finances. The monthly salary is 20 yuan, and food and lodging are provided. There are about 15 hours of part-time classes per week. If interested, regardless of gender, but with a considerable guarantee, please go to Sun Jun at Wanxiang Elementary School, Maurice Vegetable Market, Edward Road, to discuss in person.</p>
<p>We now need a female teacher to teach art, music, and common sense for three hours a day. The monthly transportation allowance is 10 yuan. Those interested please contact us at No. 68, Yongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road.</p>
<p>We now want to hire a Cantonese-speaking English teacher (or someone who is proficient in Cantonese). Applicants must have a high school diploma and be able to speak fluent English. The teaching hours are from 7 pm to 9 pm every day. The monthly salary is about 20 yuan. Those who want to apply please come to No. 4, Lane 25, Tiantong Road, Hongkou to discuss.</p>
<p>withstand the tempering of practical use. Before it moves towards practical use, it will be ruthlessly eliminated by reality.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can still speak other languages now. Suppose one day everyone has to speak Basic English, and has to add footnotes and compile dictionaries while speaking, I think that at that time, people will not only want to cry without "Hu" (there is no word for "tears" in Basic English, only "water"), but will simply want to die.</p>
<p>There are still important texts transferred to the fifth edition</p>
