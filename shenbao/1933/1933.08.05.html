<p>（華盛頓）今日美海軍部交私家船塢承造之二十二艦、大部份爲倍思勒海姆船塢與紐波特新公司所得、兩公司數年前曾在日内瓦海軍减縮會議時、不惜巨資作反對軍縮之宣傳、事後曾受參議院澈查者也、此次兩肮空母艦造價各一千九百萬元、爲紐波披新公司所得、一裝甲巡洋艦造價一一·七二○·○○○元、及四驅逐艦造價各三·八九六·○○○元、爲倍思勒海姆船塢所得、均將立時動工、按美政府原擬將二十一艦交私家船塢承造、大約因標價尚廉、故交其多造一艦雲、</p>

<h3>法佔九島事件日方趨俎代謀</h3>
<p>根據兩項理由</p>
<p>决定對法交涉</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省與各方面連絡調查法國佔據九島眞相、最近决定以如下兩項理由、對法正式抗議、主張日在九島有領土權之根據、（一）法政府佔據九島之中、四島旣有日本燐礦公司採掘燐礦之事實、（二）在該島附近從事漁業者、以日人爲最多、迄今日本與九島有密接關係、（四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）對於法國佔領太平洋九小島一事、東京方面消息謂、日本政府將提出抗議云云、本日巴黎「時報」登載此訊、綴以註釋、謂「法國佔領九小島、係於一九三○年四月發軔、而未蕆事、今年不過按照國照際公法所載條件、從新着手而已、此項小島、係在法屬越南領海中、係由越南南圻往海洋洲法屬新加萊多尼亞島最直接之路綫、法國政府爲遇必要時、得以利用此項小島起見、乃决定派海路測最團、前往案置浮標、且華盛頓會議並不禁止佔領、惟須一國軍事及行政當局、會同辦理、法國政府佔領之時、對於上項條件、已予履行、並業將各小島、劃歸越南管轄、按諸國際公法、凡私人或私營企業、最先到達一地、不能作爲佔領、易詞言之、即不能認爲一八八五年柏林條約所載之佔有是也、（比國佔領剛果、葡法相繼抗議後、於一八八五年二月二十六、遂訂柏林條約、其第三四及第三五條規定佔領之條件、（一）須通知各國、（二）須實際佔領、）此種私營企業、充其量、不過可在該地保持其事業而已」云云、（三日哈　瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本反對技術合作問題</h3>

<p>（南京）褚民誼談、汪對日人阻撓我與國聯合作問題、下星期一在中央紀念週時、將有所申說、戏察事馮仍無確切表示、馮過去態度、如中央强硬、則彼軟弱、若中央軟弱、而彼又强硬、現鄧哲熙等尚在從中調停、結果未知、黃紹雄左右云、黃定五日晚赴平晤何應欽、傳達廬會經過、並襄助處理察局、（四日專電）</p>

<p>氣、俄滿雙方主張依然有不相容之隔懸、蘇俄方面如不撤回非實際的要求、滿代表已宣言惟有中止交涉、而爲主權必要之發動、斡旋者日本外務當局之意見以蘇俄方面如固執違反滿洲獨立事實之主張、不表示誠意、則雖中止交涉亦非得已、故前途頗爲悲觀、蘇俄方面雖有將賣價减爲二億金盧布之說、滿方以此係蘇俄之討價還價政策、不願與之理論、故六次會見之趨勢如何、極堪重視、（六日電通電）</p>
<h3>美膨脹通貨出之以漸</h3>
<p>免致引起劇烈貨幣投機波動</p>
<p>政府已獲得金融界美滿合作</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據可靠方面聲稱、美政府遇必要時、即有直接膨脹通貨行動、亦不預先發表、因總統信苟預先發表某日將有膨脹通貨之舉、定將引起劇烈之投機、且以爲政府當避免足以引起金金元與外幣匯價猛烈變化之突兀行動、故即有膨脹通貨行動、亦必出之以漸、據財政界消息、近數星期來因聯邦儲備局收購政府公債、信用之膨脹固未嘗間斷、第爲數不大、故初尚不易覺、至最近三星期内、始漸切實可見耳、惟全部膨脹問題、胥皆視經濟狀况之有無需要以爲斷、美總統與其顧問固未嘗變更其非至必要時、不運用重制金元權力之政策也、至此時政府與銀行界間、正有更美滿之合作精神、各銀行曾向財部保證、必予以最完滿之合作、目下紐約以外各銀行所存現欵亦日增、逆料今後數月間、政府發行公債、化舊爲新亦甚易易云、（三日國民社電）</p>
<h3>放棄大量膨脹</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）官場消息、美總統在現行實業復興計劃獲見結果以前、不再鼓勵膨脹通貨、最近聯邦儲備局之大變方針、即可視爲放棄用大量膨脹、作對付經濟衰落武器政策之明證、聯邦儲備局當美總統就任之初、曾在公開市場大購政府公債、創行「金融鬆動」政策、當初原擬每星期購回二各五百萬元、曾實行若干時、但近已連續四星期、將購回數額大加减削、如本星期三以前，一星期内僅收購一千萬元可爲明證、據接近政府者稱、羅斯福總統已切實放棄貶落金元政策、而採取藉高工資與短工時增進買力之政策云、三日國民電）</p>

<p>（紐約）美國金礦主人因聞若干新產黃金暗中覓途赴國外之訊、對於設立黃金自由市塲之運動、進行益亟、據其發言人聲稱、渠信九月間、此項市塲當可實現、因完全禁止黃金出口後、不能激勵金礦增加出產、惟自由市塲之能否實現、似將繫於本月内政府舉新債還舊債計劃之能否成功、至若自由市塲設立後、反可增加政府對於黃金之控制、因若金價漲至與倫敦相近後、則不復有圖規避禁令之引誘、且此種市場大可增加金礦内雇用人數云、（三日國民電）</p>

<h3>倫敦滙市反響</h3>
<p>（倫敦）昨日紐約方面、謠傳美國又將採取通貨膨漲政策、故美元又跌至四元五角八分、但收盤時回漲至四元五角二分半、法幣匯市漲至八十四法郎又三十二分之十一、聞係英國儲蓄者購入法郎、以便收買法國證券之故（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>評時</p>
<h3>美蘇復交之時機實</h3>
<p>美蘇恢復國交之說。起於去年美總統大選之時。前此共和黨政策。亦未嘗不主張對蘇復交。惟以有種種問題阻隔。是以未能實現耳。第一因帝俄時代及克倫斯基改府時代所欠美國之債。在美國方面。以爲債權神聖。非一律淸償不可。蘇聯則以爲此種債務。其借貸關係。並不正當。非全俄人民所能承認。雙方皆寗願犧牲復交而不願放棄其主張。相持已十餘年之久。第二爲煤油競爭問題。現世界存油最富開發最多者。固以北美及阿拉斯加爲第一。但其强於蘇聯。亦不過十二萬萬桶。今美國油田。開發日廣。消路遍全世界。東達歐陸。西迄亞東。莫不爲美油之市塲。蘇聯乃奮起力爭。旣聚精會神於重工業。尤深知近代文明之源。駕石炭而上之者厥惟煤油。故於巴庫油田之管理。竭全力以爲之。最近復於東歐市塲。盡力開拓遠東市塲。亦作跌價之競爭。且時時利用煤油外交以購求和平。日本之購買赤油。開發北庫頁半島。即其一例。而美孚系資本在巴庫有債權關係。又安能坐視而不與競爭。此皆爲美蘇復交重大之阻力也。</p>
<p>近則美國輿論。已稍稍覺悟。對於債務問題。美總統及統治美國之資本家。亦多承認今日世界之欠債不還。實行賴債者。非僅蘇聯一國。且美蘇間債務。原爲帝俄時代關係。其數較之戰債。甚爲缳微。至於煤油之競爭。究視自身發展之能力。又僅爲營業競爭之一部分。於外交上無多大關係。倘若復交而不能成功。則其損失。美國獨重。蓋自一九二九年經濟恐慌深化以來。世界商業市塲。日趨挾小。未來可開拓之市塲。除遠東中國而外。厥爲蘇聯。因對蘇政治問題未解决。貿易上乃大受影響。近美對蘇輸出。竟減退百分之八十五。故其爲利害關係計。不得不表示讓步。而希冀復交之能順利進行也。</p>
<p>抑自日本侵略華北而後。列强在東北已無立足餘地。在華北利益。亦岌岌可危。假令世界經濟會議。能相對成功。國際合作。可以實現若干部分者。則英美之諒解增加。歐洲各國與美國之對立。亦可低減。從而裁制帝國主義之軍事暴行。或有實現之可能。無如經濟會議。毫無成果。各國經濟聯盟之基本組織。已由言論之宣傳。進而爲實際的運用。是以美國旣感歐洲各國——法蘭西以下聯合對美之困難。又覺英美諒解。僅屬口頭契約。亦不敢决其必行。而東方之日本。　爲保持共經濟地盤計。雖倡親美之論。但其口蜜腹劍人所共知。故美國在此時會。無論政治上經濟上。皆不能不於一般國際關係外。另闢一新途徑。</p>
<p>此一新途徑。在美國國内爲打破一切傳統習慣。厲行經濟的國民主義。抛棄　僅利於少數個人之辦法。而實行减少工作時間。增加工資。對外則打破舊時錮習。毅然提議承認蘇聯。以恢復從前尋常國交。在政治上或將從此引起太平洋方面之新形勢。使日本更陷於外交的孤立。在經濟上美國製造品。得一廣大消塲。蘇聯之第二五年計劃。亦可多得技術上之援助。或者資本主義之再度均衡。將於此啓其機。是則美國此舉。豈僅關係其自身一國之利害而已哉。</p>

<h3>馬將軍公佈捐欵後郎官普之表示</h3>
<p>望淸查會淸查捐欵賬目</p>
<p>並根究二千萬元之謠言</p>
<p>訪潘序倫中央社云、馬占山將軍、日前公佈收到全國慰勞捐欵總數共計一百七十一萬三千八百餘元後、潘序倫會計師、對於滬上經收救國勞軍捐欵機關、負有查賬之責、爲保全社會信用起見、故發表意見、前黑龍江省政府代理主席郎官普氏、前日特往訪潘氏、對於潘氏提出意見、有所解釋、郎氏聲明、馬將軍首批所收到之各界慰勞捐欵、共計一百三十餘萬、早經在黑省印發徵信錄報、吿淸楚、惟因一切文卷簿記、均淪落黑省、是故此項公佈總數、不能詳載捐欵人姓名或捐欵機關之名稱、惟當時天津大公報、似曾登載此項報吿、業經致函該報查詢、或可得之、潘氏對此表示、完全諒解、雙方爲保持社會信用起見、希望滬上各團體所組織之各界淸查救國捐欵委員會積極進行、淸查各捐欵機關之賬目、以昭大信、尤望對於援馬捐欵、共達二千萬元之謠言、加以根究、俾得此事可以水落石出云、</p>
<p>發表談話大公社云、馬占山將軍在黑省抗日轉戰經年、前後所收全國各界慰勞捐欵、總共一百七十一萬三千餘元、業經託由黑省財政廳長郎官普氏、於八月一日、公佈所收欵目、普發啓事、對於經收手續地點等詳加說明、以昭大信、茲悉郎氏以抗日捐欵詳數公佈後、各界尚有不明眞相者、仍不免有所懷疑、郎氏昨特向大公社記者發表談話、對外界懷疑解釋甚詳、茲誌其談話如次、</p>
<p>解釋兩點據郎氏談、馬氏所收抗日捐欵詳數公佈後、各界對此、尚有不明眞相、因而發生誤會、致起懷疑者、頗不乏人、綜其懷疑要點、不外下列兩項（一）馬將軍最先宣稱、收到捐欵爲一百四十餘萬、八月一日、各報載馬將軍代表宣稱、收欵數額爲一百六十餘萬、而八月二日正式發表之數、乃增爲一百七十一萬有另、總數究屬幾何、似尚未完全確定、令人無從檢查、（二）據馬氏稱、詳細簿記及存查等件、均已遺留黑省、其所公布之洋數、則係根據哈埠人員所保留一簿、惟此簿所登收欵數目、是否正確、有無遺漏、殊覺可疑、查最初馬氏宣稱、收到捐欵爲一百四十餘萬、係指馬氏直接收到者而言、其他尚有間接經手收到者、爲數若干、則爲馬氏所未知、且未經結算、自難知其詳數、及經馬氏進行淸查賬目後、連同同間接收到者、總共一百七十一萬三千餘元、一併結算、故其總數乃有一百六十九萬餘、此尚爲八月一日以前之賬目、迨至公布前一晚忽又接北平電稱、前黑省主席萬福麟在前線時、曾代收馬氏捐欵共一萬數千元、前後兩共、即成公布一百七十一萬三千餘元之數目、此爲淸查賬目時之情形、極爲尋常、亦即收到捐欵總數遞加之原因、外界不明眞相、或不免發生誤會、但收到總數、未能完全確定、亦屬事實、緣遺漏在外未經收到之欵、爲數必不在少、八月一日公佈之數、亦决不能認爲確數、因辦事處昨日又接南京財政部來電、謂有代收捐欵一萬餘元、未曾匯出、即此一端、則捐欵總數、又已遞增矣、故在淸查未竣之前、殊難確定總數爲若干、至於馬氏保留一簿所登惧欵數目、是否正確可靠、則本處絕對負責擔保、决無錯誤遺漏也、</p>
<p>主張澈查現在外間傳說、盛謂馬氏捐欵總數在二千萬元以上、但此項統計、究竟從何而來、本人殊爲懷疑、據本人推測、馬氏捐欵總數、雖不止一百七十餘萬、但决無二千萬元之鉅、若以所有東北四省抗日捐欵連同十九路軍捐欵一併起算、則二千萬元之數、尚屬可靠、惟外間旣有此種傳說、亦應澈底淸查、庶幾維持社會信用、而明眞相也云云、</p>
<p>勞資互助條件、及以前减工期内兩日未給之工資、與無故開除新葉三童工等案、新陳積纍迄今均未仲裁、近更阻止工友繳納會費等事、倘不據理交涉、迅謀解决、則風潮暴發、勢難收拾、昨日上午、特由全體理監事陳培德·劉得華·樓景觀·蕭庚生·張子平·費克光·鮑仰周·胡小妹·謝培基。任禎祥·任坤大·董敖生·章木芳·　增榮·洪梅全·王阿金·李春德·鄭黎明·竺士浩·章阿五·等二十餘人、携帶呈文、赴市政府請願、由第二科科長洪奎接見、工會代表面遞呈文、并陳述工會從前主辦學校經過、并云、在民國十六年以前、廠方自辦之學校、諸多不合定章、每月學生僅三百旬、經費一千五百元、現本會辦理、學生有七百餘名、廠方只貼七百五十元、今并欲取消、顯係别有作用、請向廠方據理交涉、以淸懸案、請一併提付仲裁、當由洪科長答復、（一）學校事依據條件、應由主辦者辦理、（二）停工期内二日工資、修改管理規則、及勞資條件、新葉被解雇三童工各案、卽轉俞秘書長、從速解决、工會代表等認爲滿意、乃興辭而出、附工會呈市政府</p>

<p>工會停頓第四區棉紡業茷籌備委員爲黃兆輝等十</p>
<p>五人、自籌備後、即爲廠方絡續藉詞解僱者計八人、自黃兆輝被綁後、各籌備委員、驚惶異常、認爲太無保障、不得已均暫避、以免蹈前轍、因此工會負責乏人、無形停頓、至於黨政機關對於黃兆輝之被綁、得呈報後、已暗中進行澈查、以明眞相、</p>

<h3>江水退落安慶出淺困難</h3>
<p>船員大都返滬</p>
<p>太古公司長江輪安慶號、在上月廿五日、由漢下水、行至將近九江之靑山港江面、其時上游江水甚大、安慶輪因避讓一船、致駛近靠左岸、而在靑山港之花樓島之下嘴角、突遭擱淺、當時公司得訊、已令漢潯兩分局、派拖駁小輪等、駁貨拖救以深陷沙泥、無法曳出、嗣後該公司又派大船黃浦號駛往拖救、經過十餘日之施救、而總吿失敗、公司方面、祗得暫派代班江輪、另議營救方法、</p>
<p>船擱田内在此數天内、長江上海水退甚速、安慶輪擱淺之際、尚在大水期、故當時以爲擱阻在江邊灘岸之上、乃至邇日水尺銳落、江岸現出、而安慶輪之擱淺、係在江岸以外之田畝内、船體深陷泥中、船身之外吃水無多、如果江水再退、該輪將完全擱在乾岸之上、而危險更甚、脫險亦更難矣、</p>
<p>船員返滬船内職員茶房等、近日以營救無效、而且一時無脫險之望、故相率離輪、乘船還滬、該輪買辦翁子淸、昨亦從九江乘該公司輪返滬、向公司報吿詳情現在船中客貨等項、已經完全駁淸、船員留居者、亦僅生火水手等一部分、</p>

<h3>萬目睽睽之經濟會議已有結果</h3>

<p>嚴肅的空氣，籠罩着經濟會議的席上。現在，議程已提到人生的消費問題了，小學敎員代表高振鐸，從席間站起，發言道··「主席，我們當敎員的，眞是很淸苦的生活。但在這炎熱的夏季，又不能不着長衫。可是長衫不是窮敎員所能多置的，止置一件，又苦於洗滌的不便，因爲洗滌時須搓擦排刷，常常會使牠損壞。這點，應請主席提出大家討論，求牠一個救濟的辦法。」主席正想發言，可是農人代表阿土生却搶着說道··「眞的，在這樣年頭兒，過活很不易。高代表說的洗衣問題，確乎也是我們農人所同感困難的。試想肥皂價目，不是日見增高嗎？這樣下去，呌我們無產的農人，怎麽負担？」阿代表說才完了，工人代表勞阿大歎了口氣站起來。他說··「兩位代表說的，固是我們所切急想解决的事。洗衣一事，非但關係於消費問題，并且在時間問題上，也很有關係的。試想我們做工的人，對於時間何等寳貴。倘使沒有比較妥善的辦法，那末我們不是常常要閙扣工錢的巴戲嗎？」商人氏表陶朱生舉起手表示附議。他又說··「像我們做買賣的人。對於衣着。當然是要淸潔而合於衛生的。但淸潔衛生四個字，却非金錢不可。可是際此市面不景氣的時代，又有什麽閒錢來多添服飾。所以本席也希望主席加以討論。」主席聽了這四個代表的提案，便對大衆複述一番，公開討論。坐在首排的經濟博士金光斗站起來道··「主席，要解决這個問題並不難。我們只要家家備着一種皂精，便得了。」主席問道··「金博士說的是不是上海經濟皂精廠新發明的金鷄牌皂精？」金博士答道··「是的，這皂精是國貨界驚人的發明，牠的去汚力很强，洗滌綢布，旣省時，又省手續。並且氣味淸香，性質醇和；價廉物美，眞是解决各位代表洗衣問題的唯一妙品，各位不妨接受鄙人的意見，到各大公司或大煙紙店在藥房去買牠一盒來試試，包各位能得到十分的滿意。」主席待金博士坐下；，才笑着對大衆道··「皂精的功效，是本主席所深知的，確像金博士所說那樣。所以，各位都應該嘗試的。」全塲不待主度說完，就春雷似的一片掌聲，於是一個經濟的難題，便順利地解决了。</p>

<h3>宣傳過當</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>宣傳過當，」這是黃紹雄先生在總理紀念週報吿華北抗戰失敗之原因的十三項原因之一，列之爲第七項者。原文是「犯宣傳過當毛病，致眞相難明」十二個字。</p>
<p>「宣傳過當」竟是「毛病」，與其他「軍隊系統複雜，指揮不靈敏，」「軍器物質上太差，」「軍隊紀律不佳」等十二個失敗原因同其重要，可見中國由「宣傳過當」這個毛病上吃的虧，實非淺鮮了！的確，「宣傳過當」在中國，不啻是一個狐媚子，大家知道它不是善類，而又喜歡和它親密，尤其在戰事期間，幾不可一刻或離。它又不啻是糖衣的毒果，一時覺得好吃，吃下去可不得了，就不免成爲「毛病。」談到近年抗日，若是以塘沽恊定爲吿一叚落的話，則「宣傳過當」竟是與抗日相終始的；將來再抵抗，也還不免於「宣傳過當。」因爲這個毛病，中國已染得深而且久，成爲痼疾了！豈但朱毛殘部在報章上殘了數年，不得消滅，實在是自有外係以來，中國就染了「宣傳過當」的「毛病」，中間經過了八十年沒有愈，又怎能希望在最近之將來便能霍然！</p>
<p>自中英鴉片之役，國人傳統的以天朝自視，而視英人爲夷狄以來，經過中法中日諸役，雖然國人對外觀念、已逐漸變爲崇拜，而在每一役軍事期間，「宣傳過當」這個毛病，總沒有稍變。申報於中法之役，不隨衆宣傳過當，獨遣記者赴戰地視察，刋出與衆不同的戰報，當時還惹起讀者反感到事後纔明瞭申報不負使命呢！從這一點看來，又可見國人本歡喜讀過當的宣傳，以求取快於一時；國人此種心理，只怕也就是八十年不愈的原因，什麽臥薪嘗膽，不過在失敗後用以解嘲而已！</p>
<p>然而也有例外，最近汪院長電復李濟深陳銘樞，謂日軍多倫之失，並非由於戰敗，乃因熱河潰兵蝟集多倫，食盡燒光，不得不退，僞軍劉桂堂部乃得從容進入，股鑒具在實爲張家口危之！曰不得不退，曰從容進入，且爲張家口危，這就不「過當」了。但是據馮玉祥方振武的吿捷電，則又因汪電而充分證明其「過當」，眞相如何，依舊難明。</p>
<h3>刮痧</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>這幾天，雖天公做美，在這大傘高張的當兒，忽然烏雲四布，雷聲</p>
<p>殷然，不一會，居然下了幾陣驟雨，使人熱得喘息不休之際，獲到片刻的凉爽，但未幾，雨停止了，地熱度曾不稍微减低，依然汗瀋如漿一般的而下來，這是多麽煩悶啊！</p>
<p>不但這樣，還有感受着暑氣，胸中陡學不舒適起來，初起似要作惡，後來雖欲不嘔吐而不得，俗語呌「害痧」，（吾邑人土音，害字，念若黑，）且這種病，在暑天酷熱的時候，常常會得見到，而尤其是婦女們最多，你，看他頸間看細細的好幾條殷赤的紅紋，這不是一個顯着的憑據麽？當那右手中指和食指屈而緊夾其喉嚨，這種聲響，也煞是好聽，因恐其乾滯欠滑生痛，乃以油水蘸之，故舉掻提起皮肉時，𥒐然淸脆可成拍子，隱約露出井井然的條數，并愈多愈妙，有人賜他一個極有趣味的名詞，呌「俏痧」，不過這爲助嬌添媚之一種藝術，實在恐怕還不是眞害了痧，所以呌「拔痧」，並不是「刮痧」，若講「刮痧」，這就不在頸間施此工作了。</p>
<p>這麽呌「刮痧」，那方法，往往用制錢蘸油其上，使害痧的人，袒其背，斜斜的左右刮着不但紅印顯然，倘呈露了紫色的現象，那末，歡喜「刮痧」的人們，說是痧已藴蓄深久的原因，所以時常見到「刮痧」後，他們亦竟有霍然而恢復健康之身體的，不能說「刮痧」是沒有一些功效，但「刮痧」不是自己患病的所能，須要靠他人助此手術，方能做到，這「拔痧」和「刮痧」，是兩件不同的治法。然而這一個「痧「字，吾考了許多字書，終找不出這字來，就是一部康熙字典，可稱繁博了，也沒有載了這個「痧」字，從前德淸曲園老人，說「痧」，即「沙」字之訛，一個人受了鬱熱，胃納不淸，血液停滯，亦象黃河之水自天上來，被著泥沙阻了，潮流也遂不通，一個意思，要治這種病，在背上一條條刮去，就使他血脈徐徐的活動，以解散其風寒暑濕的所積，這是極簡的法兒，這一解說，頗覺相近，若以古時「針砭」兩字來强爲附會，例反不免犯了穿鑿的毛病哩！</p>
<h3>閘北之夜</h3>
<p>— 冠英</p>
<p>黝黑臭濁的蘇州河水，深深地劃着華租兩界的線。走上橋頭，一陣臭穢逼人的風，直往鼻管内鑽，使人下意識的想到走進了另一個世界。</p>
<p>黃包車，並排列在橋下的兩側，他們沒有大照會，這裏是他們的第一道防線，大家都屬目在橋上那處是他們的生命線，只要橋上走下一個衣履稍爲整齊的人物，大家便拖着車蜂擁的迎上去。「黃包車要嗎？」類的聲音，帶着乞憐的尾調。不幸從來人的口中回出一個「不」字，大家便都沒勁打彩的拖回去，再注視到那繼續的來者。</p>
<p>電燈火是那樣幽暗而不明，年紅燈在這裏是幾於絕跡，馬路只見到些黃包車的來往，偶爾夾着一部運沙石和煤炭的卡車；像雪佛蘭奥司汀一類光亮油滑的汽車，在這裏做夢也看不到。行人中也找不到像南京路上並肩挽手走着的截髮旗袍的少女，與西裝革履的靑年。這裏只是些短衫褲半摩登的做工的姑娘，和赤着膊披着衣的勞苦羣衆，他們整日的疲勞，藉此可以疏散一下。</p>
<p>馬路的水門汀上，橫一條蓆子，直一塊木板，倒臥着整天在赤日下工作精疲力倦的人們，他們爲避免鴿籠中的悶熱，和破壁上臭虫的侵擾，不得已來這馬路殖民；雖然公安局的皇皇佈吿，貼在通衢，然而警察先生們，也只好做了視若無睹的木偶。</p>
<p>這裏特别多的，是白相的人們歪戴帽子倒扱鞋，是他們特有的標識。一遇馬上偶爾發生些小事故，大家便圍繞上去，平空的插上一腿，算是他們的打抱不不？</p>
<p>一切的一切，覺得這裏是另一個世界，與租界上不同的一個世界……</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十二回寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍犧牲甘解甲戰士多情</p>
<p>趙翁想着，其實兒子回家來那一次也是怱怱忙忙的來去，單是到了今天，他就感覺的不自由了。趙自强走到前院，正好遇到了江氏，他就舉行了個禮，然後笑道··好幾天不見，老太太好哇？江氏見人家客客氣氣的招呼着，怎好不理，笑着點頭道··趙連長很忙呵。趙自强道··這兩天趕上了檢閱，營裏一陣胡忙，總是抽不動身，有許多要辦的事，都躭誤了。他聽說許多要辦的事當然楊趙聯姻這件事也在内。提到了這裏，江氏怎樣的好往下說。便扯開來道··院子裏怪冷的，到家裏喝碗水去吧？他是一句客氣話，以爲說了這句話，彼此就可以走開了。然而趙自强並不那樣辦，就向他道··水倒用不着喝，談一會子……他一面說着，一面在衣袋裏掏出悶壳子表來看了一看，笑道··不要緊，我還可以坐着談個十來分鐘。江氏是自己請人家來的，人家來了，倒不讓坐不成？因之也就只好向前開了風門，將趙自强引到外面屋子裏來坐。桂枝自然是作夢不會想到趙自强到家裏來坐的。他正舀了一盆熱水，在外面屋子裏洗手，兩隻袖子，捲得高高的，露出兩隻溜圓的手臂，按在水盆裏。看到人來了，却不能抽出兩隻濕淋淋的手臂就走，因之也只好向趙自强點了個頭笑道··趙連長回來了。趙自强被他這一笑一呌，便覺得週身有一種說不出來的感觸，連連點着頭道··是的是的。桂枝擦了手，將那盆水潑了，然後回到裏面屋子裏去。很不自然的，隔了門簾子，咳嗽了兩聲。（一四九）</p>

<h3>新式眞空管的命名</h3>
<p>— 振之</p>
<p>最新式無綫電用眞空管的命名法，在美國較舊式的更有系統。每一侠數字都具有特殊的意義。例如最初的一位或兩位數字，是表示眞空管的燈絲電壓的。燈絲電壓在二·一以下，用１來表示；在二·一至二·九之間，用２來表示；在三至三·九之間，用３來表示。所以燈絲電壓爲二伏特的眞空管，其開始的數字是１，燈絲電壓爲二個半伏特的眞空管，其開始的數字是２，其餘依次類推。</p>
<p>在最初的一組數字以後，是一個字母。這是表示這眞空管的用途的。整流用的眞空管，從Ｚ字開頭，照着Ｚ，Ｙ，Ｘ…的次序，順次倒退回來；（現在只有用Ｚ字的）其餘的眞空管從Ａ字開頭，照着Ａ，Ｂ，Ｃ，Ｄ…的次序，順次遞推上去。例如Ａ代表高週率擴大用，Ｂ代表檢波及低週擴大用等。至於在字母後的數字，則是表示眞空管所有的極數的。</p>
<p>照了這一種命名法，我們看見眞空管號數，立刻就可知道這眞空管的電壓，用途和構造，在實際應用上非常便利。譬如號碼２Ａ５是表示這眞空管的燈絲電壓是二個半伏特，具有五極；號碼２５Ｚ５，是表示這眞空管的燈絲電壓是二十五個伏特，用爲整流器，具有五極。</p>
<h3>無眞空管收音機的研究</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>美國芝加哥地方的斯脫勞次無線電公司宣佈了一個驚人的消息，說已有人發明不用眞空管的收音機（非鑛石機）。發明者乃一年僅二十二歲的靑年名呌安奈斯脫柏屈里克（Ｅａｒｎｅｓｔ　Ｐａｔｒｉｃｋ）美國肯脫干（Ｋｅｎｔｕｃｋｙ）人。現居於印第安那省的哥侖比亞城。他從事於無眞空管收音的研究，已六年有餘，初猶秘而不宣，直到去年才把他試騐的成績宣吿世界，引起了全球的震駭。</p>
<p>這種無眞空管的收音機，也是用交流電供給的。不過就完全不用眞空管，而成績反要比有眞空管的來得好。據他試騐結果，說發音極淸響，調撥亦甚便利，且能收遠地的播音。每架所費僅美金六元左右，用電也低及普通一般收音機之一半。這樣非常的成績，眞夠令人駭異，聞其製法亦極簡單。但目前其學理上的詳細討論，尚在保守秘密中，外人不知其詳。</p>
<p>柏屈里克生於肯脫干的格拉司哥地方一九一一年）在十歲的時候，他父母從肯脫干的山野之鄕，遷居於印第安那。這無眞空管的收音機，就在那裏研究所得的。有一天，他偶然去撥動一個開關，無意中把一根電線觸動，忽然就得到了聲音，那時他的收音機並沒有開着，於是他由好奇心而感到萬分的興趣，從此就孜孜不倦，悉心研究。直到後來這事引起了無線電工程家的注意，都來證實這個試騐。並且在芝加哥與貝特福兩城内商Ｎ，特派了委員來考察，都感到十分興趣。於是他們就供給柏氏以一極完備的試騐室，每月更津貼他美金二百五十元，以爲試騐之用。（未完）</p>
<h3>２５Ｚ５新式眞空管之介紹</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>被稱爲無線電界靈魂的電子管，自佛來銘氏（Ｆｌｅｍｉｎｇ）發明二極管第福來（Ｄｅｌｏｒｅｓｔ）始創三極管以來，四極，五極，交流式，無燈絲式等，日見進化，眞是令人咋舌。現在於美國無線電市場上又有一種新式電子管問世了。名曰２５Ｚ５牠是專司檢佊工作的。</p>
<p>特點</p>
<p>普通整流管如２８０，８２等·有絲極與屏極二極，這２５Ｚ５管除此兩極外，多一對陰極，見圖一。２８０，８２·整流管稱爲直接燃熱式（Ｄｉｒｅｃｔ　ｈｅａｔｅｄ　ｔｙｐｅ　ｄｉｒｅｃｔｌｙ　ｈｅａｔｅｄ　ｃａｔｈｏｄｅｓ）２５Ｚ５管則稱爲間接燃熱式（Ｉｎｄｉｒｅｃｔｌｙ　ｈｅａｔｅｄ　ｔｙｐｅ　ｏｒｉｎｄ　ｉｒｅｃｔｌｙ　ｈｅａｔｅｄ　ｃａｔｈｏｄｅｓ）還有幾點２８０　　２５Ｚ５一圖</p>
<p>相異的地方是··燈絲電壓較高·燈絲電流較低；絲極及屏極的電源直接取給於１１５弗打交流電上，不需要變壓器升高或降低電壓。</p>
<p>特性</p>
<p>名稱　２５Ｚ５</p>
<p>用途　整流</p>
<p>絲極電壓　２５弗打</p>
<p>絲極電流　０·２安培</p>
<p>屏極電壓　１１５－１２８弗打</p>
<p>屏極電流（輸出最大値）１００千分安培</p>
<p>使用</p>
<p>這２５Ｚ５管使用時與平常整流管一樣可作半波整流或全波整流。圖二，爲半波整流接法，圖三，爲全波整流接法。</p>

<h3>地下天線</h3>
<p>— 陳杞杯</p>
<p>天電干擾爲無綫電之絕大障碍，較其他之干擾爲尤甚。有時發生連續爆裂之聲，足使收音之工作完全停上。此種干擾之强度，隨氣候而變化，日間較夜間爲甚，夏季較冬季爲甚。至避免之方法，除ＶＴ君所述之遮蔽引入綫外，尚有地下天綫一法，成效則尤較完美也。</p>
<p>隔離式收音機　膠布封回　鉛包線</p>
<p>至於裝置方法以一百呎至二百呎長之十六號鉛包線埋於地下，深約一·五呎至二呎，其埋入地下之一端，須用橡膠布封固，以防漏電。他端則引至收音機以代天線。</p>
<p>但收音機須用隔離式者，方可見效</p>
<p>；而電源段亦須用金屬隔離。地線引入線及連接線均須用鉛色綫以達完全隔離之目的。</p>
<p>如所用爲普通之收音機，可以洋油箱作爲隔離，將收音機放入，而將洋油箱接通地綫亦可應用。</p>
<p>此種地下天綫亦有方向性質，鉛皮綫若正對之播音臺，則收音時較其他電臺之成績爲佳。</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<h3>請自製一張電臺表</h3>
<p>— ＶＴ</p>
<p>你的收音機能夠收到幾個電臺？某電臺在我的收音機接收起來，配諧度盤（除了收音機是購買現成而度數是用週率直接指示的。）應該是幾度？在度盤上幾度，應該是那一家電臺？這些想來是有收音機的人都想知道的。果然也有人作出表來，把聽到的電臺一一列舉，未聽到的再繼續尋聽。但手續似很麻煩。　　我們知道電臺的週率或波長與自己收音機内部的配諧電路（即調節電容器。）及綫圈有一定的關係。若綫圈一定，電臺週率一定，則電容器容量也就有一定所不同的，只是電容器容量和型式有所不同，因而各人的收音機度數就不能不兩樣了。</p>
<p>今照圖作表，則檢查極爲便利。左旁註週率，以基羅爲單位，上方註度數。先將所聽到的電臺，查知其週率，並注意自己度盤上的度數，則如一般圖表的作法，直看橫推，在二者於表中相値之點，作一記號，註明其電臺符號名稱度數　基羅週率（ＫＣ）</p>
<p>。如國華週率爲一二○○，而機上度數爲三○度，則其交點如圖。於是更換一個照樣寫上，愈多愈妙。如是則各電臺之點，在圖表上將形成一根直綫或曲綫。隨即畫上。如果你的電容器是直綫波長型或直綫週率型，那末所成之綫即爲直綫，若爲普通直綫容量型則所得爲曲綫。</p>
<p>有了這張表，那末你聽得了一個電臺，不知他的週率波長的就可以從你的度盤度數上推算出來，譬如中西在你的度盤上若爲四二度，則自四二度直看至交點再橫看過去，便知是一○四○基羅週率。反之你要找尋一個電臺。已知他的週率，那末只要反其道而行之就好。例如中央電臺週度約爲六八○基羅，你雖沒有聽到，但從表中可以查出要接收中央必在七五度。</p>
<p>如果度數和已知週率之交點不在圖表曲綫（或直綫）之内則那電臺波長必已改變了。（註大中華週率爲一一六○，度數爲三七，圖中地位有誤，製版時未及校正特此更正。）</p>
<h3>常識</h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（１）　（２）　（３）</p>
<p>（十二）天綫電路（Ａｎｔｅｎｎａ　Ｃ）ｉｒｃｕｉｔ）天綫電路間最關緊要者爲交連方法（Ｃｏｕｐｌｉｎｇ）。在天線所接收之射電週率電流，如欲供給之於檢波電路，則天線電路與配諧電路間之交連方法不得不講究。其方法隨接收裝置而異，種類頗多，然歸納之，則不外乎圖一所示之三種。圖中１爲直接交連，（２）爲電容交連，（３）爲磁感交連。（１）與（２）時有增加雜音之虞，故多不採用於長距離之通信，因其構造简便，多用於近距離之收音，（３）所示之磁感交連爲標準式交連法，使用甚廣。</p>
<p>在天線所引起之射電週率電能，一部分爲天線電路之高週率耗阻所消耗，一部分成波動之形狀再起振盪作用，而其剩餘部分則供給於收音機，此第三部分之電能爲作用於聽筒或喇叭之有效分分子。然吾人必須記淸；此有效分子影響於天線電路之配諧度甚大。若配諧線圈Ｌ２與天線線圈Ｌ１之交連寬，而天線電路所接收之電能少量時，天線電路保持自由永續性，與其固有週率相合，能繼續振盪。反之，若兩線圈之交連密，且由天線所接收之電能爲大量時，則天線電路之振盪較寬交連者易於减衰。</p>
<p>茲設Ｆ爲天線及配諧兩電路之固有週率，Ｋ爲兩電路間之交連係數，則交連電路可興下式二週率Ｆ１及Ｆ２相配諧Ｆ１＝Ｆ—　+K，F2=F—　1-K，K=M—　L1L2上式中L1爲天線線圈之自感量，L2爲配諧線圈之自感量，M爲兩線圈間之互感量係數。由上式可知兩電路爲密交連時，天線可同時吸收兩不同電波。若兩電路爲寬交連，且M之値可忽略，則F1與F2爲同値，且等於其固有週率F。由是吾人可知兩電路爲密交連時，可發生廣範圍之配諧現象。如兩電路爲寬交連時，可發生銳敏之配諧現象。</p>
<h3>測算電綫的簡法（續）</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>（三）求橫截面積</p>
<p>己知綫號，則應用求綫號的方法，能算出橫截面積。</p>
<p>例··四十號電綫，其橫截面積有若干圓密耳？</p>
<p>解··因知三十號綫，其橫截面積爲１００圓密耳，故四十號綫爲１００×·０＝１０圓密耳</p>
<p>（四）求第吋之圈數</p>
<p>已知直徑，除一千密耳，即求得每吋之圈數。</p>
<p>例··三十號電綫，其每吋之圈數有若干？</p>
<p>解··三十號綫的直徑爲１０圓密耳，故１０００÷１０＝１００圈</p>
<p>（五）求每磅之長度</p>
<p>求某綫每磅之長度，以該綫的橫截面積及　００３相乘積之數，除一千後即得。</p>
<p>例··一磅三十號綫，其長度有若干呎？</p>
<p>解··１０００÷（１００×·００３）＝１０００÷·３＝３　３３呎</p>
<p>（六）求線之重量</p>
<p>某號電線之重量若干，以該線的橫截面積爲·００３乘之，其相乘積數即爲該線之重量（注意，此次單位用一千呎，若爲一百呎，以十餘之；若爲一萬呎，則以十乘之）</p>
<p>例··今有三十號電線一萬尺，求其重量若干？</p>
<p>解··１００×·００３×１０＝１００×·０３＝３磅</p>
<p>（七）求負載之安全電流</p>
<p>通常以一千圓密耳，能負載安全之電流爲一安培，所以應用此法，將電線的橫截面積數爲一千圓密耳除之，即求得該線之負載安全電流若干。</p>
<p>例··三十號電線之安全電流，能負載若干安培？</p>
<p>解··１００÷１０００＝·１安培（完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>讀書作文安全法</h3>
<p>— 達一</p>
<p>自由談上論及古今文人之受壓迫，及其避禍方法，已不少矣。日前小雪先生悶坐一文，又提到許多文字上之血案，結論三歎，皆云「文章還是不做的好」。最後說到讀書亦易犯禁，因云「做文章旣危險萬狀，閉户讀書也會遭到飛來的橫禍。」以愚所見，此等文人不知讀書作文安全法，危險災禍之來，正所謂活該者也。</p>
<p>漢之賦家王裦，善爲歌功頌德之文，其始也貢諛刺史，刺史薦之天子，旣見天子，乃獻聖主得賢臣頌，因得待詔宫廷。如此下筆，豈僅安全，升官發財之道在焉。唐初詩人沈佺期宋之問，諂附武后姘夫張易之，一面爲張代製奉和應制之詩，一面爲張奉溺器，今語謂捧便壺，沈宋居然宦達。此一文統自李斯枚乘司馬相如王裦揚雄以至沈宋，洎於今茲，繼繩弗墜。凡稍明吾國文學史實及現代文人情形者，一言及此，當能相視而笑，莫逆於心也。日人福富織部所著之「屁」書，載一文士，死見冥王，王忽撒一屁，士即拱揖進辭曰··「伏惟大王，高聳尊臂，洪宣寳屁，依稀絲竹之音，彷彿蘭麝之氣。」王大喜。命牛頭卒引去别殿，賜以御宴。至中途，士顧牛頭卒曰··「看汝兩角彎彎，好似天邊之月；雙目炯炯，渾如海外之星。」卒亦善甚。扯士衣曰··「大王御宴尚早，先在家下吃個酒頭了去。」吾輩文士，倘能如此作文，不僅生而取容當道，死亦優受閻王小鬼之豢養。此作文安全之法也。</p>
<p>讀書安全之法，至爲簡易，曰奉命讀書是也。如秦皇焚書，止許民間藏卜筮種樹一類之書，或學法令於官。漢武重視儒家典籍，罷黜百家。以及明淸政府，止令士子誦讀功令所許之書，與御纂御定之書，而銷燬無數違碍干禁之書。換言之，士生其時，讀書而不奉命者，恐有不測之禍也。如今邪說異端大作，各種主義紛歧，明哲之士，當擇其中最安全之一種而讀之，庶無大過。否則潛心讀經，亦是佳事，雖然此等古籍未必可以禦侮救國，而當路在勢者頗能提倡也。至於閉門思過，幽居反省之人，尤以嚴格遵守奉命讀書之法爲宜。隋文帝時，以鄭譯貪汚著跡，又與母别居，除名下詔曰··「譯嘉謀良策，寂爾無聞。鬻獄賣官，沸騰盈耳。若留之於世，在人爲不道之臣。戮之於朝，入地爲不孝之鬼，有累幽顯，無以置之。家賜以孝經，令其熟讀。一今之奉命讀書如鄭譯者，未聞有貪官汚吏，倘有其人，即食前此未能奉命讀書之報也，其取僇辱亦宜矣。</p>
<h3>「人怕出名猪怕胖」</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>人出了名，和猪胖了以後，都是可怕的。怕什麽？一言以蔽之，被「吃」。</p>
<p>猪的胖總在大了以後；旣大又胖，該</p>
<p>殺的時機已到，於是被墩着吃，炒着吃，做成丸子吃，切成薄片吃。因爲胖猪肉，不但可以充飢，而且味美。</p>
<p>出了名的人，常要被人提及。一經提及，毁譽隨之。在某種情形之下，無論讚楊或者惡駡，同是被吃。吃出了名的人，同吃胖了的猪兩樣；前者是直接的，後者却是間接，大槪是這樣的，從什麽人手裏每月領到幾十塊大洋，專門在出了名的人上面做功夫；於是，不但本身可以吃得白白胖胖，還可以養老婆，養兒子。</p>
<p>猪的被吃，要先流血，一吃就吃光。出了名的人，被人吃着會更出名，好像無甚關係。即使被惡駡，或者反會因此受人尊重；譬如Ａ，本來於民衆並無什麽信仰，被早爲民衆所怨恨的人駡了以後，旁人便以爲旣然不好的人要駡他，可見不壞。倒是在讚美的範圍以内，有時眞被吃得不痛不癢··譬如，吃「出了名的人」的人要辦什麽刋物了，一天以内，連去兩次，三次，即使不在家，也要寫個字條打麻煩，一做做好事－」非寫點應酬品不可。</p>
<p>又如，吃「出了名的人」的人，要從辦什麽刋物去騙一個「土老闆」的錢，說是同許多出了名的人都要好，於是先請客，非去做一回樣子不可，否則就跟着不肯放。</p>
<p>吃出了名的人，比吃胖猪肉的方法還要多，到了謠言造得無從再造時，只是說說皮膚的黑白，和汗毛的多少，也都可以當作什麽「新聞」，仍然按月支用幾十塊大洋，吃得白白胖胖，養活老婆，還養活兒子。</p>
<p>其實，出了名不一定是可怕的；如果是從槍杆出名的，誰敢去動一動毛髮？還有從什麽黨政機關出名的，也將受人恭維之不暇。連從吃出了名的人出名的，也可以從什麽「新聞」，什麽「刋」和什麽什麽來互相標榜，更大出其名。</p>
<p>再說，被人吃也不一定是可怕的。只要吃得適當，讚掦固然無所謂怕，被駡也是痛快的。只是從皮膚的黑白上，和汗毛的多少上議論，難免感到無聊。吃人從皮膚的黑白和汗毛的多少吃起，這實在是愚笨的。可見，被「呆蟲」吃，這才是可怕的了！</p>
<h3>强盜之妻（短劇）</h3>
<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>人物··法官法警强盜强盜之妻强盜之子</p>
<p>景··法庭</p>
<p>時代··一九三三年</p>
<p>地點··上海</p>
<p>正當開審</p>
<p>法官那麽，你丈夫作的事，你全不知道了？盜妻（搖搖頭）不知道。法官他作了强盜了，也不知道嗎？盜妻不知道（再搖搖頭）。</p>
<p>法官他作强盜，就是犯了法，你知道嗎？盜妻（低頭不響）……</p>
<p>法官犯了法是要辦罪的。現在本院要定他的罪。你旣然都不知道，可見你並沒有共同犯罪，本院從寬開釋你，你好好的帶着兒子回鄕下去罷。</p>
<p>盜妻（低頭不語）……</p>
<p>法官你爲什麽不響，你不願意去嗎？</p>
<p>盜妻（點點頭）……</p>
<p>法官爲什麽不願去？你丈夫犯了罪，此地沒有人養你。你回去好。你一定要回鄕下去。</p>
<p>盜妻我已經說過了，我們在鄕下沒有飯吃纔到上海來的。誰知道一來幾個月找不着事，現在我不能再回去。</p>
<p>法官你不回去，在此地怎麽活呢？上海也沒有飯好給你的呀。你不是已經知道？</p>
<p>盜妻我願意在上海餓死。</p>
<p>法官那麽，你的孩子呢？交給誰？而且你身上好像還有孕，是嗎？</p>
<p>盜妻（垂涙點頭）……</p>
<p>法官我看你不回鄕下去是不行的。孩子太小，上海也難生活。你丈夫現在要吃官司。</p>
<p>盜妻到鄕下也是死，我願意和他一道死。</p>
<p>法官你丈夫現在并沒有死罪啊。</p>
<p>盜妻那麽我和他一道吃官　司。</p>
<p>法官你沒有罪怎麽好吃官司？你不下鄕是因爲沒有路費嗎？（沉思有頃，從身上取出幾張鈔票遞給法警）那麽本院現在給路費給你，你回鄕下去。這是例外，本院看你可憐。盜妻（法警把錢給她，她推開，不受）我不回鄕下去，我要和他死在一道，在一道吃官司。</p>
<p>法警老爺看你可憐，特别施恩，路費也給了，—</p>
<p>盜妻那有什麽用？我不要錢，我只要我的丈夫。（抱住她丈夫大哭）</p>
<p>法官（無可奈何）那麽你要怎麽樣？</p>
<p>盜妻我的丈夫吃官司，我也要吃官司，他死，我也死。</p>
<p>法官官司是不好吃的，和你說過，你沒有犯罪。</p>
<p>盜妻我丈夫犯什麽罪？</p>
<p>法官他搶。</p>
<p>盜妻可是他要吃飯，要養活我和孩子。他犯了罪，我也就犯了罪。我們都一樣是要活的。（掙扎，哭）</p>
<p>法官（揩揩汗，無法可施。）那麽，那麽，把她帶下去，收起來。你也吃官司去罷。</p>
<p>法警拉着强盜之妻一同下，孩子跟在他們的後面。法官在座上惘然地立起來，向庭後退下。－幕落－</p>
<h3>暴風雨</h3>
<p>— 鳳城</p>
<p>天氣悶熱極了，寒暑表已快升到一百度。坐在家裏也不是，跑到馬路上去也不是，汗，只是不停地流下來，流下來……</p>
<p>我坐在由上海到江灣去的一部車子中，車子簡直象蒸龍，炎　從四面逼進來，我　息得快要透不轉氣來了；柏油馬路給太陽一晒已經溶化，車輪着了粘性也跑不快了。</p>
<p>在這樣悶熱而煩燥的空氣中，忽然天上推上了烏雲了，太陽也歛了牠的光芒，雷聲一響，傾盆大雨抒隨之而起，只一霎那間，狂風暴雨如萬馬奔騰而來，剛才像蒸籠似的我坐的黃包車，現在却變成了一隻漏斗，暴風雨認準了這個目標打進來，那破碎的油布的遮布早已給狂風吹去了一半，大雨來得更劇烈，只片刻功夫，我已變成「落湯雞」了。</p>
<p>看着離開江灣還遠，本來我是可以退回家裏去暫時避避這暴風雨的襲擊的；但是我不願意，我無論如何不願意去定回頭的路，我想··我只要鼓起一些勇氣，不屈的堅决抵抗這暴風雨的襲擊，我是無論如何可以達到我的目的的。而且，在窒息欲死的悶熱的天氣中，忽然來了這樣一陣狂風暴雨，身心方面感到多麽的痛快啊！我决不願再回去坐在悶熱的屋子裏了，要享受到這樣痛快的淸凉的空氣，當然是要受一些犧牲的，衣服雖然濕了，但是精神却是痛快的！</p>
<p>結果，我是冒了暴風雨達到了我的目的地－江灣。</p>
<p>現在的時代是太悶了，悶到好像在百度左右的熱度下，坐在像蒸籠似的黃包車裏，在炎威逼人的馬路上跑着一樣，一般靑年天天在喊··「煩悶啊，煩悶啊！」，這時代使人窒息欲死了，我們是需要暴風雨的來臨啊！不過，在時代的暴風雨下，個人是不免要受一種犧牲的，如果耐不過這種暴風雨的襲擊和犧牲的人是不免要退回去逃避，或者沒落下去，能夠堅忍地抵抗暴風雨的襲擊和不怕爲暴風雨所犧牲的，他們是有代價的，他們是能達到暴風雨過後的光明的前途的！</p>
<h3>平凡的事（三二）</h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>電話是佩萸和叔晋打的，已經問了四處地方，沒有一處曉得雍孫現在的踪跡；有一處，馬斯南路，說他是今天早上七點鐘回家的，三點鐘吃了午飯，又躺了一會才出去；另一處，小花園，說他是今天傍晚四點鐘來到那裏抽過烟的，起身的時候本來口稱要去看伯唐，但是臨到上車忽然有一個坐汽車的西裝矮胖子邀着同走；其餘兩處，都說今天沒有看見他。現在他們嫂叔二人正打着電話和第五處講話，但是不久從答復裏面，也只曉得他這幾天頑錢頑得很高興，却說不出其他的情節來。伯唐看到這條路是走不通的了，於是走回書房裏去和文卿商量，預備一個在明日下午以前還尋不着雍孫的救濟辦法，意思就是花點兒的錢，探明那兩處門牌號數，明天就可以到那裏附近等候雍孫，使他不至於牽涉到這件公案裏面。</p>
<p>「我們還有甚麽不可以商量的嗎？」文卿說，「不過案子的風聲很大，看來「行裏」的人未見得那樣好談。」</p>
<p>「究竟大到怎樣呢？」伯唐說。</p>
<p>「聽說每天總有三四十部汽車，其中有二十多部的　會牌號，已經查出都是上海很有名氣的人的。這樣一塊肥肉，行裏辦案的人那裏肯容易鬆！」</p>
<p>「唉，眞倒霉！」伯唐悽凉地嘆了一口氣，「今天眞是我受難的日子！廠裏的事，和之光忙了一天，總算才有辦法，現在又要替「爺老爺」忙；尋常聽慣的公私交迫那句話，眞地輪到頭上了！」</p>
<p>「你不必慌張，伯唐，」文卿說。</p>
<p>「爲甚麽！這眞是呌人急殺的事！」</p>
<p>「自然，你說的也是很對的；」文卿說，「不過禾，行裏的人雖然未見得肯容易鬆口，也並不是絕對沒有法子可談；並且從現在扣到明天三四點以前，還有十四五個鐘點，只要事前找得着老伯，那末豈不就是天下太平！所以我看還是努力尋找最爲爽利。」</p>
<p>「你的話很對，文卿」，伯唐說，「旣然承你關切，我想最好是雙方並進··我們一面着手去尋他老人家，一面還得費你的心，請你明天和「行　」的人先行接洽。倘若有一個辦法，這樣我才可以心安理得了」。</p>

<p>新粳前後已跌一元</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源四十餘號、本街店胃尚佳、惟市面猶屬平庸迺以作客心意依應需之貨爲轉移、且各帮到貨多少不匀、故價升降不一、客帮包胃較懈、統計北洋帮採辦靑角松楓薄稻一千餘包、行情乃修削角砠、變陰元去路不廣、致價續疲、廠新粳又低二角、價開七角、良以開始一轟太足、致下游勢如破竹、前後已跌一元矣、</p>

<h3>借麥將次裝華麵粉市氣虚軟</h3>
<p>昨日粉市一致呈續跌之象、以洋麥報價、漲勢已弱、芝加哥坎拿大均祇好二三角左右、而市塲空氣、則大爲轉動、以借麥將次裝華、人心之不穩、自無待言、更因美國之過剩小麥、依然將傾銷於中國、此種消息、在在予多頭以不利、再以各廠現粉、實在冷寂、普通廠粉、照標準别至一角至一角半、與標準相等者亦須别五分不等、實銷之淡、不難想見、所以各盤中賣氣極盛、廠家亦陸續出檔、市氣遂益虚軟矣、結果本月份較前日跌一分二厘半、九月份跌一分七厘半、十月份跌一分二厘半、十一月份跌一分、十二月份跌一分半、一月份跌一分云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>人們的思想</h3>
<p>— 史斌</p>
<p>思想是人們所特具，-至少也當說是特别靈敏與豐富。　　因了有思想，造定了「人爲萬物之靈」的基礎；因了有思想，世界變成了人們所獨佔的世界；因了有思想，人們享盡了天地間一切的快樂。　　然而，也因了有思想，人們受盡了比萬物都深厚的痛苦。</p>
<p>思想，是値得贊頌的東西，同時也是非咒駡不可的東西。假使把這贊頌和咒駡一加比較，我要說一句有許許多多人不以爲然的話··「咒駡的成分濃厚於贊頌。」</p>
<p>由思想的結果所產生的快樂，不過是一時的享受；而隨之以來的悲哀，却往往隨時隨地不能免除。</p>
<p>我們見月亮團圓而加以謳歌，然而圓了之後便是缺，團圓不過是缺蝕之始；我們見鮮花開放而加以嘆賞，然而開了之後，便要萎謝，開放不過是萎謝之初。世界上一切的事情，往往快樂在前面正在起步，而身後的悲哀已緊步追趕。-人們是特别富於思想的東西，所以月圓的時候，已經可以想到它缺蝕時候的暗淡，花開的時候，已經可以想到它萎謝時候的零落，也就是快樂的時候，悲哀的影子，早己潛伏着不去了！</p>
<p>科學家用盡了九牛二虎之力，發明機器，减少人力，大量生產，多麽値得贊頌，然而就因了這層，許多手工業工人敲碎了他們的飯碗··許多的工人因此而失業，難道也是非贊頌不可的嗎？科學家更用盡了九牛二虎之力，發明槍砲，保國衛民，多們冠冕堂皇，然而人們的性命從此更不値錢。犧牲許許多多人的性命，以爲自己成功的代價，難道也是一種不世偉績嗎？</p>
<p>政治家運用着他的聰明才智，在新聞紙上發表着洋洋大觀的高調宣言，不是痛哭流涕，便是天花亂墜··-不是是爲不衆如何如何謀幸福，就是說自己是如何如何爲大衆盡死力。然而其結果，能否兌現，還是成了一個問題。</p>
<p>人類萬事，最初是懸着一個「思想」，等到這思想，一旦成爲事實，許多人高聲慶祝；就在這高聲慶祝之中，接着便有一個「悲哀」，不召自至而來。　　我們不敢肯定的說··人們思想是罪惡的，可是思想在事實上，往往要變成罪惡，其所不同者，不過是或顯或隱罷了！</p>
<p>這是許多轟轟烈烈的大人物所不及或不屑料到的；也是我們默默無聞的許多小東西所輕易不能得到快樂的一個小小緣故。</p>
<h3>開彩以後</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>萬目睽睽，許多人日夜所企望着的航空建設奬劵的五十萬大財，現在已經</p>
<p>開彩了。得奬的號數，是二九九二八七，據報載是由上海商業儲蓄銀行售於大運的購主的。還有其他的二彩三彩四彩五彩六彩七彩等等號數，也已完全揭曉出來了，於是得奬者迷開眼笑，未中者欲哭不得，欲笑不能，一種失意的形狀，也非拙筆所能表示出來。</p>
<p>三種　的飲</p>
<p>請飲涼茶　北平酸梅湯冷飲　希</p>
<p>據作者所知，一般購有奬劵的財迷，對於奬劵的保護，却是無微不至的，有藏之於錦繡小盒之中，有藏之於隨身皮夾之内，且有一般婦女們，很迷信的</p>
<p>拱於玻璃鏡架中，藏於内室，而天天點香焚燭以求中彩者，有某老嫗積半年動勞之心血購有獎劵一紙除每日焚香點燭外，並向灶神磕頭以求中彩者，其他如拆字求中彩，求籤望中彩，相面望中彩，做夢求中彩等等，其奇形怪狀，不一而足，中國人之發財狂，已整個的暴露出來，可是現在航空奬劵已是開彩了，這許多日日惟發財是求的財迷同志，竟無一而中彩，可謂枉費心血，冤枉之至了。</p>
<p>但是財迷們，請不要灰心，不要失望，不要悲哀，要深深地認識失敗乃成功之母，希望乃事業之花，我們只要等待着未來的機會，報紙上不是刋載着第二期航空奬劵，不是又要舉行了嗎，而且更是價廉物美，每張一元，說是普及購衆，嘉惠民衆之意，我們不妨再來一個希望，仍有做未來的大富翁的資格。　　財迷們，請快些準備第二期購劵的資本、如果你暫時沒有錢，那末，不妨拿衣服等去押於小典舖，或者少吃三天飯，省出這一元大洋來，去買一張奬劵，這樣，你便有了希望了，不但在名義上，你是救國同志，而且在實際上，你是候補的中國富人。</p>
<p>財迷們，請不要灰心，請不要慨歎，今番的不中彩，不能達到你洋房，姨太太，汽車大菜等等目的，但是，你要</p>
<p>再接再厲繼續努力，你如果能這樣，不灰心，你終是有希望的，上帝是不會辜／</p>
<p>負你這有心人。</p>
<p>好，第二期的奬彩，又要開始了，恭賀中國再多幾個富人，來完成孫中山先生民生主義的目的。</p>
<h3>南方的賭城</h3>
<p>— 君式</p>
<p>「南方人豪於賭」，這句話我們可以從很多事實證明出來。梁鳳君的「深圳的大賭塲」的叙述，就可以拿來作點證明，不過還是幾許賭塲中之一，最著的還算有「南方的賭城」之稱比得上蒙地卡羅Ｍｏｎｔｅ　Ｃａｒｌｏ的澳門。</p>
<p>牠是葡萄牙統治下的屬土。毘連着中山縣的一個半島。那裏的商業並不發達，握着全埠金融威權的就是那些賭商－居了全埠三分二以上的富翁。</p>
<p>那裏最普遍的賭是「番攤」，我們可以從每一個角落裏見到這樣的賭塲。在方橫僅數里的狹小面積的小城，番攤館的設立有數百所之多，大約是拿着兩毛錢就有縱博的資格的緣故吧。</p>
<p>番攤館有建築得異常宏偉的，裏面有供賭客休息和喚妓的精緻房間，餐室，和烟床等等很完備的陳設，能滿足賭客的任何物慾需要。好像譏餓的時候，他們供給很精美的餐和白蘭地酒；抽大烟的有鴉片供給你儘量的抽；喜歡妓女的，他們喚來給你娛樂。這些都不要你的一點破費。賭完的時候，還可以送你幾張船票。</p>
<p>其次普遍的賭要算「舖票」，「山票」和「白鴿票」三種。舖票和山票是和香檳票一樣的辦法，但是牠五日和七日開奬一次，票價則多少不等。白鴿票是異常平民化的有奬義會。</p>
<p>那裏還有下注千金的骰子賭塲；新近建築比上海的還要宏偉的跑狗塲；跑馬塲；以至牌九塲，鬥牛塲（一種牌的賭）撲克塲……等等種類繁多的賭塲。　　那裏的賭客多是由香港，廣州，和其他地方來的豪紳，富翁，軍人，政客，和他們的太太等。數千金的下注是視爲很平凡的事，使他們剝削得來的金錢多半放到那裏。</p>
<p>一個驚人的統計數目使得我們驚詫；每年因賭負在那裏旅店或歸途中自殺的平均有二百人之數。那些並不是富紳一類的人，者是些可憐的管賬員和智識薄弱的婦女，很不幸地墮落那帝國主義設下的可怕陷阱裏。</p>

<h3>掃墓團</h3>
<p>— 征鴻</p>
<p>當這反對「祖先崇拜」的潮流中。「掃墓」這名詞。在一般新人物眼中。早已看得輕微渺小而無意義的事了。雖然還有我黨國柱石。以身作則的每年奉行幾次—掃墓。但也挽不了已倒的狂瀾。想不到七月卅一日國府紀念周。張繼提議「以後每年淸明節。應組織西京掃墓團，使全國民衆得祭掃民族祖先。如周公漢武帝等墓。藉以激勵民族性。並盼在校學生。能踴躍參加。因晚近敎育。習於洋化。對民族固有美德。反漸遺忘。離開民族性而言敎育。至爲危險。」云云。這位黨國先進的老成謀國。確是在航空救國、跳舞救國，麻將救國之外。新添了一個救國方法—掃墓救國。我們小百姓在原則上自應切實奉行。　　虧周公漢武的墓不在東西四省。否則將抱恨終天了。－東西省是失去了。華北停戰了。西北角上的馬二先生。早由黃委員長請他「結束抗日」了。以後每年淸明時節。抗日的健兒。放下大刀。莘莘學子。放下書本。以至全國父老姊妹。諸姑伯督。以至善哭妙根篤爺的王旡能先生。一齊帶了長錠草𦯁。破掃帚。凹畚箕。浩浩蕩蕩。直奔長安道上。向着一沐三握髮。一飯三吐哺的周公。和威震四夷的漢武帝墓上。舉行一個空前絕後的掃墓運動。最後還得效着小孤孀上墳。一齊號啕大哭起來。－阿彌陀佛。上天不負孝心人。我們的祖先有靈。霎時間天昏地黑。鬼哭神嚎。東洋大海起了大大的海嘯。把扶桑三島翻沉在萬頃洪波中。這時在歐洲作客的不抵抗將軍。還須向東南角上瀝酒相賀。以祝掃墓救國之成功！</p>

<p>坐在介夫對面的趙一山固也是實業途中的失敗者，但是他却還在專門地沒有副業地仍在繼續着奮鬥，對於介夫的這話當然完全表示同情，但今天晚上，這三大巨頭之共坐談話並非偶然的，是在商量對於自由市的態度問題·在銀行家的吳子卿，覺得國内工業之不能振興，商業現狀之衰退，金融的流通當然難於活躍起來。他但願上海市的絕對開放而繁榮起來才有辦法，譬如目前他的資本除了開設電影院，跳舞塲等類的娛樂事業之外，簡直祗有將銀圓成爲廢物地埋在地窖裏了，這是一般市民所眼見的，正當的工商業日漸衰落，而電影院却一天天增多，這種畸形發展的原因原就在金融無法流通的結果，而楊介夫雖則拚命地包攬着各種特種投機生意，究竟工廠倒閉，仍然得不賞失，所以他已不能不走到銀行界一條路，對於自由市的態度是與吳子卿毫無二致的。祗弄得純粹的工業家的趙一山－或被稱爲民族資本家的趙一山心裏只呌得苦，他明知在工業上硬幹下去，終只有失敗，但自由市的開放，則他的產業將毫無保障地在各國大資本的工業競爭之下更迅速地被吞併了。所以當他聽到楊介夫那一番話後，祗得嘆了一口氣道··</p>
<p>「橫直你們是早就轉了頭，翻了一個身了。」</p>
<p>吳子卿還未來得及抽開嘴上那枝雪茄，楊介夫已先搶着說道··　　「你有什麽不好呢！市面繁榮了的時候，你的情形却又是另一番現象了。購買力增加，與你總有點好處的。」</p>
<p>這一個片面的解答，當然不足鎭服鎭靜他對於大工業吞併小工業的恐懼吳子卿連忙接上來··</p>
<p>「一山，你想錯了，那時候我們金融流通起來，對於你的帮助總容易些！我們答認投資呀！」</p>
<p>實際上，這祗是一種貓哭老鼠的話，幾年來，趙一山已吃盡了他們金融界的苦頭。吳子卿只見拿出幾百萬的資本來左一家右一家開電影院，從不肯借過大批的資本給他那認爲難於振興的工業家。就算偶然在他的錢毫無辦法流通的時候借了一次，但那高昂的利息總使得趙一山得不償失。無論趙一山的雄心多大，能力多足，屢次祗有向吳子卿屈服的份兒。現在吳，楊對於自由市都是贊成的，那末，他反對也確然沒有什麽特殊的利益，便點着頭在吳子卿那種貓哭老鼠的一言兩語的空頭諒解之下同意了。同時更表示他不是因爲屈服而同意，也有他自己的理由，便道··</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Goes to Xiahuayuan to Meet Feng</h3>
<p>-A New Turning Point in the Chahar Situation-</p>
<p>Feng's Representative Arrives in Shacheng Expressing</p>
<p>Willingness to Accept the Government's Proposed Solution</p>
<h3>Passenger and Freight Transportation Greatly Inconvenienced by the Division of the PingSui Railway into Three Sections</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan plans to meet with Feng Yuxiang to discuss the Chahar situation and resolve it as soon as possible. Originally intending to go directly to Zhangjiakou, he was dissuaded by the authorities and changed his plans to go to Xiahuayuan, requesting Feng to meet him there. After reaching an agreement, the authorities telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek for instructions and received permission. He is scheduled to go to Xiahuayuan tonight. The authorities hope that Feng will accept Chiang and Wang's suggestions and implement the steps planned in Beiping as soon as possible, all of which will be conveyed to Feng by Song. Whether there is hope for a final settlement of the Chahar affair depends on Song's trip. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After He Yingqin drafted three proposals and telegraphed Feng for consultation yesterday, Feng sent representatives from Zhangjiakou to Shacheng this morning to meet with front-line generals Pang Bingxun and Guan Linzheng. Guan then used a long-distance telephone to report the situation of Feng's representatives arriving in Shacheng to Beiping, stating that they accepted the government's proposed solution and welcomed Song's quick return to Chahar Province. Feng's representatives did not stay long in Shacheng and immediately returned to Zhangjiakou. It is heard that a peaceful resolution to the Chahar affair is expected. Song will first go to the PingSui Railway area tomorrow, and Feng will immediately issue a telegram canceling the Anti-Japanese Allied Army and ending everything. The security near Zhangjiakou will be temporarily maintained by Tong Linge. The local military and political aftermath will be reorganized separately after Song returns to office, and the three proposals set by He will be implemented step by step. The situation on the PingSui Railway remains calm. Xu Tingyao has dispatched Chief of Staff Ji Nai to return to Beiping by PingSui train to report everything to the authorities. Important generals such as Pang and Guan are all in Shacheng today. Pang plans to return to Beiping for a visit in the next day or two. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and Ding Wu will lead a small number of troops to Shacheng on the fifth day of the lunar month. Feng will step down after Song arrives. Deng Zhexi in Tianjin has received Feng's radio message agreeing to accept the three proposals made by He Yingqin. He ordered Song to return to Chahar on the fourth day of the lunar month, stating that the Commander-in-Chief will immediately station himself in Shacheng to handle everything in accordance with the government's intentions. It seems that the Chahar situation is undergoing a rapid change. Song's guard at Dongyue Temple arrived at Xizhimen at 11:20 PM on the fourth night, waiting for orders. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Feng steps down, the troops of Fang Zhenwu, Sun Liangcheng, Ji Hongchang, and Tong Linge will be reorganized into divisions, and the remaining troops will be reorganized into brigades. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Chiang and Wang's telegram (28th) was issued, all parties have deeply understood the central government's difficulties in handling the Chahar affair peacefully. Feng, realizing that the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable, has recently repeatedly sent representatives to Pang Bingxun to negotiate, entrusting him to convey to the authorities here his tentative acceptance of the four principles proposed in Wang and Chiang's telegram (28th) and stating that he would end military affairs immediately, return Chahar's administration to the central government, and hoped that officials would be sent here to take over. After Pang reported Feng's intentions to Chairman He, it is heard that He issued an order to Song Zheyuan on the third day, ordering him to station himself in Shacheng in the near future, adhering to the principles of Wang and Chiang's telegram (28th) and the three conditions proposed by He, to handle everything locally. At the same time, this order was also communicated to Pang Bingxun. It is heard that after Song received the order, he planned to lead a small number of guards and staff to Shacheng within the day to preside over the Chahar affair. If Feng truly has peaceful intentions and puts the party and the country first, then the resolution of the Chahar situation will have a rapid and downward trend in the future. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch) (Beiping) Song Zheyuan is scheduled to leave Beiping on the fifth to go to the PingSui Railway, first to Shacheng to meet with Pang and others, and then return to Zhangjiakou after Feng issues a telegram. Tonight, the headquarters of the 29th Army notified the PingSui Railway Bureau to prepare a special military carriage to be attached to the 11th train, with only about 20 secretaries and staff members accompanying him. If no accidents occur temporarily, he should be able to depart. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin's three proposals for resolving the Chahar affair have been telegraphed to Feng for consultation. The arrangements for the aftermath will be determined after receiving Feng's reply. He summoned Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiong Bin, and others to Jurentang this morning to discuss everything and requested Song and others to assist in resolving the Chahar affair as soon as possible. Since Feng interrupted the PingSui Railway after deducting funds, it is heard that Feng's troops have begun selling passenger and freight tickets from Chaigoubu to Xinzhuangzi, dividing the PingSui Railway into three sections, causing inconvenience to merchants traveling between Beiping and Baotou. Representatives from merchants in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua went to Shacheng the day before yesterday to request Pang, Guan, Xu, and others to restore transportation. Pang and others agreed to contact the PingSui Railway Bureau. The person from Zhangjiakou said that after arriving at Xinzhuangzi, he had to walk 90 li, passing through Xiahuayuan and Xinbaoan. The two sections of the railway were not damaged, only the trains were not running. The Railway Bureau will send Zhou Jingtai, the chief of the transportation department, to Shacheng to inspect the front line and prepare to restore transportation. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tonight, a special train is prepared at the railway station to carry Song Zheyuan to Xuanhua to meet with Feng Yuxiang to persuade him to accept He Yingqin's suggestions regarding the Chahar situation. The Chinese here are paying close attention to Song's trip, as peace or war depends on the success or failure of its outcome. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch Council dispatched staff member Hou and Lei Yan to Shacheng yesterday to meet with Pang Bingxun, Guan Linzheng, Xu Tingyao, and others. After some discussion, they prepared to go to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng immediately. They set off from Shacheng this morning. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Gang telegraphed Beiping, reporting that he has assumed the position of Brigade Commander of the Independent 46th Brigade. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu stated, "I have no opinion on the Chahar affair. If Feng returns to Mount Tai alone, I can protect his safety." (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhanhai went to the Huashaoyingzi area to inspect defenses and review troops and has now returned to Yuxian. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gao Yingkui has been promoted to replace the commander of the Changjiang armored train, which guards the PingSui Railway. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are still no special movements on the front line of Chahar Province. He Yingqin's telegram to Feng, discussing resolution methods, was sent out on the fourth day. The final steps will be decided after Feng receives this telegram and indicates his response. However, many expect that Feng has no sincerity for peace and fear that a satisfactory outcome will be difficult to achieve. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chahar situation has recently taken a serious turn. Feng is inherently cunning. Because of Wang and Chiang's telegram, the central government is eager to seek a peaceful resolution, so he has become tougher. Deng Zhexi and others are still trying to mediate, hoping that Feng will become aware of the situation so that the Chahar situation does not deteriorate. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops East of Tangshan Begin to Withdraw to Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>The Suzuki Brigade Stationed in Miyun Also Withdraws to Gubeikou</p>
<p>Zunhua and Qian'an Have Not Yet Been Taken Over</p>
<p>The Beiping-Shanhaiguan Railway Can Be Restored Immediately</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops in various places east of Tangshan on the Beining Railway began to withdraw outside the pass today and are scheduled to complete the withdrawal on the seventh day. Li Zeyi stated that the Beiping-Shanhaiguan Railway is expected to be restored on the eighth day. However, according to transportation circles, there may still be complications, and it may be necessary to open to Qinhuangdao first before gradually expanding eastward. The county seat of Linyu County must wait until the Japanese troops east of Tangshan withdraw outside the pass before it can be taken over, and there should be no obstacles. Sun Weishan, the county magistrate of Jixian, has led the police to take over, and there has been no report on the situation. Li Shoushan's puppet troops in Zunhua have all been transferred outside the pass. Because the new county magistrate has not yet reported for duty, it has not yet been taken over. Tao Shangming came to Beiping to visit Huang and went to Tianjin this morning. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops along the Beining Railway have been successively transported out of the pass. The Suzuki Brigade stationed in Ningyun began to withdraw to Gubeikou today. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Personnel from the Japanese military medical unit in Miyun and a small artillery team have all departed towards Gubeikou. The rest have not yet moved. Suzuki, the brigade commander, is scheduled to host a banquet for Sun Shutang, the county magistrate of Miyun, on the fourth day, and invited He Guiting, the puppet county magistrate, to accompany him. Officers from the Japanese Tianjin Garrison Army, along with attendants and four Chinese policemen, arrived at the Miyun County Government in five cars on the second night. Because of the issue of arrears, no agreement was reached after negotiations between the Public Security Bureau and the Japanese. As of the second night, it had not been possible to take over. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming went to Tianjin this morning and is scheduled to go to Qinhuangdao with Yin Tong tomorrow to negotiate transportation issues with the Japanese. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Puppet troops in Funing County are still controlling the government. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei has been unable to take over. Xue Zhiheng telegraphed the provincial government on the fourth day, stating that Li Jichun had sent personnel to assist in the takeover. There are still two or three thousand puppet troops outside the city of Lulong who are unwilling to be disbanded. They attack the city after dark, and our security team is helpless. There are also many bandits outside the county town, and the city gates are closed at dusk. The situation in Qian'an is even worse. Even if the takeover is forced in the future, the government's orders may not be able to leave the city. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hattori Brigade in Shanhaiguan has been ordered to move into the Jinzhou war zone. Only Zunhua and Qian'an have not yet been taken over in each county. The puppet troops in Zunhua are being transported out of the pass. The Jire Province government has transferred the county magistrate of Shulu Guan to go. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Zeyi received a telegram from Lieutenant Colonel Chaisan, reporting that the Japanese army will complete the withdrawal on the eighth day, and the Beiping-Shanhaiguan Railway can be restored. A transportation conference is scheduled to be held in Shanhaiguan on the fifth day to discuss intermodal transportation and specialized items. Representatives from China, Japan, and the puppet state will attend. The conference is scheduled to last for three days. After the conference closes, the Beining Railway can be officially opened. There may be problems with moving the Linyu County government to the old city of Shanhaiguan, as there are many puppet postal bureaus and agencies in the city, which must be left for future negotiations. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping Railway Bureau received an order that after the Beiping-Shanhaiguan Railway is opened, all military personnel traveling east of Lutai shall not wear military uniforms or carry firearms on vehicles. The Railway Bureau has instructed all stations to notify them. (4th Dispatch) (Beiping) Li Jichun's dismissed soldiers have been transported away, and more than a hundred dismissed officers and soldiers have passed through Beiping to be transported to Baoding for dismissal. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming, a member of the war zone reception committee, went to Tianjin on the morning of the fourth day and then went to Luandong for inspection. Li Zeyi will go to Beijing within a day to report on the negotiations for receiving the war zone, leaving Yin Tong in Beiping to prepare for contact at any time. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Expresses His Determination Not to Participate in the Civil War</h3>
<p>Sends Representatives to Visit Chiang and Issues a Circular Telegram</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying dispatched his representative Hu Jiesan to visit Chiang in Gan today to personally present Sun's plan to go to Qinghai to reclaim land and his determination not to participate in the civil war, and to request that the army's salaries and compensation be issued as soon as possible. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying issued a circular telegram on the second day, saying, "To the newspapers and the public for their information, since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty years have passed, during which there have been frequent rebellions and disasters. Coupled with the economic aggression and military oppression of imperialism, the country's vitality has been almost completely depleted, and the essence of the hinterland has been looted. Not only are the poor and miserable people dying in heaps, with no way to help them, but even wealthy families feel insecure and cannot avoid being displaced. These are all natural phenomena of twenty years of civil war, which Kuaiyuan has witnessed with a wounded heart and heard with tears, and cannot bear to describe in detail. After the September 18th Incident, three provinces were successively lost in less than ten days. As the bandit forces expanded, the country's prestige was greatly damaged. Soon after, Rehe was alarmed, and Luandong was attacked. Kuaiyuan was ordered to lead his troops to resist the Japanese. Bloodshed in the frontier, and the isolated army struggled hard. The number of those who died and were beheaded reached three thousand, and the number of those with broken arms and legs also exceeded four hundred. In the end, due to insufficient resources, it was difficult to maintain it for a long time. The armies on the front line all felt this difficulty, which led to the loss of Rehe and the endangerment of Beiping and Tianjin, making our entire nation and all our comrades in arms patriotic but lacking the means to resist the enemy. Even if we want to be unyielding and avoid losing our rights and humiliating the country, we cannot do so. Moreover, with the loss of the four provinces, the country's power has become more and more constrained, and the annual taxes have been drastically reduced, making us feel that our salaries are exhausted. We can only watch as our dead and wounded comrades in arms have nothing to compensate them, and even the strong officers and soldiers will freeze and starve. This is also the inevitable result of twenty years of civil war, which Kuaiyuan stomps his feet and feels heartbroken, anxious day and night, and cannot forget for a moment. I believe that although the granary of the Northeast has been lost, the treasures of the Northwest are still rich. At this time, when the country is weak and the situation is pressing, and the military and civilians are in distress, when internal and external troubles are fraught with crises, if all my comrades in arms cannot fundamentally eliminate their feudal thoughts, thoroughly expose their warlord masks, and resolutely escape this whirlpool of internal strife to find a way out for the future of the country and seek survival for the entire nation, but instead repeat the same mistakes, allowing rebellions to follow one another endlessly, regarding the Northeast as lost and ignoring the Northwest, then even if the violent Japanese can wake up from their dream of aggression, various doctrines that do not conform to the national conditions will be enough to destroy us. This is what Kuaiyuan is alarmed by himself, vowing not to participate in the civil war, but to lead his troops to work hard to reclaim land on the border. Recently, the central government has issued a clear order, and I will follow the order to rectify my subordinates and ride westward. It is not that Kuaiyuan does not want to eliminate the ugly captives, restore our lost land, and secure our country, but it is because the life and death of the nation and the safety of the country depend on this and not on that. I have to reluctantly go west to be the vanguard of development for my elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters, and to be the basis for recovering lost land in the future. However, because this matter is of great importance, it depends on the efforts of everyone. All the development of industry and the major plans of the beginning are beyond the reach of the wisdom of one person and one department. Even the tens of thousands of people will not be able to succeed without the concerted efforts of everyone. Therefore, I hope that overseas Chinese, domestic pioneers, and sages in the West, workers, and peasants will understand the foolishness of seeking the country and provide considerable assistance in terms of economy and planning. Alas, the great chaos has not yet ended, and the national crisis is pressing. Every time I stroke my shield and raise my spear, I feel heartbroken and resentful. Kuaiyuan has no way to secure the country, but has the strength to reclaim land, based on his foolish heart, and come up with this inferior plan. It is not that I want to avoid being self-sufficient, but how dare I compete for land to consolidate myself? From now on, I will be a soldier or a farmer, but I only seek to be well-fed and well-clothed. Today, I herd horses in Taolin and temporarily hide myself in fishing and firewood. In the future, I will wield my spear in Huanglong and work hard on the battlefield again. I respectfully present my heart and pray for a bright understanding. Sun Kuiyuan, the commander of the 41st Army of the Army, bows and stamps. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Lanzhou reports that Sun Dianying's reclamation army is exploring paths and water sources. It is difficult to provide supplies west of Wuyuan. Sun's army will not come to Gansu within the year. The anti-Sun atmosphere in Qinghai has gradually eased. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Military Branch Council Sends Aircraft to Reconnoiter the Rebellious Troops of Zheng</h3>
<p>Zheng's Troops Flee to the Border of Chahar Province</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Zheng Guilin's troops mutinied in Machang and fled west, they have looted the people along the way and destroyed the telephone and telegraph lines along the way, making it difficult to pursue and suppress them. The Military Branch Council has transferred two reconnaissance planes to Beiping, which will be transferred to Baoding immediately to reconnoiter the whereabouts of Zheng's rebellious troops so that they can be cleared as soon as possible. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The remnants of Zheng Guilin's troops have fled out of the Zijing Pass and reached the border of Chahar Province. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangjiakou said that a few days ago, a division commander of the volunteer army led two guards to a brothel. The Feng's Big Sword Team happened to be patrolling and questioned the division commander for a long time. The division commander then went out into the courtyard and was hacked to death by the patrolmen. It is generally rumored that it was Deng Wen, which remains to be confirmed. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Provincial Capital Has Been Lifted from Martial Law</p>
<p>Liu Sheng is Scheduled to Take Office</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Dihua reported that Chairman Liu Wenlong and Supervising Officer Sheng Shicai's telegram orders have arrived. Liu Sheng is scheduled to take office on the morning of the seventh day. Ma Zhongying's remnants have collapsed, and the situation has eased. Martial law was lifted in the provincial capital on the third day. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The disturbances between various parts of Chinese Turkestan, though inquired into by the Chinese Central Government and efforts made for their settlement by the sending of officials to Urumchi, are still not terminated, but a Turkish leader named Kojeni Azis Khan has been negotiating with the Chinese authorities at Urumchi and is willing to cooperate in resisting the Tungans of General Ma from Kansu. It is understood that the Chinese authorities have handed over the region of Hami to Kashgar Fafmanzis (transliteration) to the jurisdiction of Kojeni Azis Khan while they themselves control the region north of the Tien Shan Mountains.

<h3>Bloody Battles Occur in the Minjiang River Area</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Goes to Renshou to Supervise the Army, First Destroying the 24th Army and Then Suppressing the Communists</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Appoints Six Route Commanders-in-Chief</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chengdu will hold a post-disaster conference, and the date has not been set. Liu Xiang has gone to Renshou to supervise the army, first destroying the 24th Army and then suppressing the Communists.

<h3>Sun Ke's Speech in Qingdao</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) At about 9:00 AM on the fourth day, a reporter went to the Yingbin Hotel to visit Sun Ke. He was received and Sun said that he was summoned to Gan by Chiang's telegram. When he arrived in Gu, the military and political conference had ended successfully. The central government is still adopting peaceful means to deal with Chahar and has sent Nei Huang to Beiping to convey the central government's intentions and discuss a settlement plan. After Feng accepts the central government's proposal, further discussions will be held on all post-disaster issues in Chahar Province. In any case, force will not be used, because the state of the country is such that it cannot withstand another civil war. As for Japan's opposition to the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China, it will not affect us in the slightest. This move by the Japanese will only increase the League of Nations' aversion and expose their hideous face. The central government will first devote itself to unity in the future, with the overall goal of working together harmoniously to avoid the declining situation. Then, while stabilizing politics, it will develop industry, first making the country's strength abundant before discussing national defense. Due to economic reasons, China's navy cannot be established quickly, so it should first strengthen its air defense to have self-defense capabilities. I will stay in Qingdao for more than ten days before transferring to Shanghai to return to Beijing. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Preparations for the Pacific War: The United States Begins an Unprecedented Shipbuilding Program</p>
<h3>The Secretary of the Navy Signs Contracts with Private Shipyards: Construction of Thirty-Two New Warships to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson began an unprecedented shipbuilding program, signing contracts for 32 new ships, of which private shipyards will build 22 warships, valued at $129,777,600. The remaining 10 ships will be built by naval shipyards, with construction costs still budgeted as usual, with actual expenses reported and reimbursed later. Swanson also stated that he is still a pacifist and believes that this shipbuilding program is also a peace movement and an aid to relieving unemployment. He would rather see all countries reduce armaments to maintain peace, but since this method has not been adopted, the best insurance for peace today is to build warships to the limits of the treaty. All 32 ships will begin construction immediately. Naval shipyards, due to limited funding, will temporarily begin work on a 40-hour week system. (3rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Of the 22 ships contracted to private shipyards by the U.S. Navy Department today, most were obtained by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and Newport News Shipbuilding. These two companies spent huge sums of money to campaign against arms reduction at the Geneva Naval Disarmament Conference a few years ago and were subsequently investigated by the Senate. This time, the two aircraft carriers, each costing $19 million, were obtained by Newport News Shipbuilding, and an armored cruiser, costing $11,720,000, and four destroyers, each costing $3,896,000, were obtained by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. All will begin construction immediately. The U.S. government originally planned to contract 21 ships to private shipyards, but it is estimated that because the bid price was cheaper, it was contracted to build one more ship.</p>

<h3>Xu Peigen Talks About the Air Force Development Plan</h3>
<p>Annual Funding Planned at 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Director of the Aviation Administration Xu Peigen flew to Hangzhou at 7:30 AM on the fourth day. According to him, the Lushan Conference's plan for developing the air force has been largely determined: (1) Emphasis on both air and land forces; (2) Establishing factories to manufacture aircraft domestically after two years; (3) Focusing on training civilian urban air defense, with the first large-scale civilian air defense exercise to be held in Nanjing after 16 months, the second exercise in Shanghai after another 12 months, and the third exercise in Tianjin; (4) The annual funding for the air force is planned at 50 million yuan, accounting for one-tenth of the army's military expenditure of 500 million yuan, but it has not been determined due to the government's financial situation. Reports in the daily newspaper that I will purchase 3,000 aircraft within three years are purely rumors and not factual. The Aircraft Donation of the Aviation Construction Association will be delayed due to Qian Xinzhi and others being in Gan. I will fly to Lushan again within a week. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Tries to Intervene in the French Occupation of Nine Islands</h3>
<p>Decides to Negotiate with France Based on Two Reasons</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry, in contact with various parties, investigated the truth of France's occupation of the Nine Islands and recently decided to formally protest to France based on the following two reasons, claiming that Japan has a basis for territorial rights over the Nine Islands: (1) The fact that Japan's Phosphorus Mining Company has been mining phosphorus on four of the Nine Islands occupied by the French government; (2) The largest number of fishermen engaged in fishing near the islands are Japanese, and Japan has had close ties with the Nine Islands to this day. (4th Japan United News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the French occupation of the nine small islands in the Pacific Ocean, news from Tokyo said that the Japanese government would lodge a protest, etc. Today, the Paris "Times" published this news with a commentary, saying, "France's occupation of the nine small islands began in April 1930 and was not completed. This year, it is only starting again in accordance with the conditions stipulated in international law. These small islands are located in the territorial waters of French Vietnam and are the most direct route from French Cochinchina to the French New Caledonia in Oceania. The French government decided to send a hydrographic survey team to place buoys there in order to use these small islands if necessary. Moreover, the Washington Conference did not prohibit occupation, but required that the military and administrative authorities of a country jointly handle it. The French government fulfilled the above conditions when occupying the islands and has divided the islands under the jurisdiction of Vietnam. According to international law, the fact that a private individual or private enterprise first arrives in a place cannot be used as occupation, in other words, it cannot be recognized as the possession stipulated in the Berlin Treaty of 1885. (After Belgium occupied the Congo, Portugal and France protested successively, and the Berlin Treaty was signed on February 26, 1885. Articles 34 and 35 stipulate the conditions for occupation: (1) All countries must be notified; (2) Actual occupation is required.) At most, such private enterprises can only maintain their business in that place," etc. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Opposes Technical Cooperation</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei to Give a Report at the Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese military deliberately issued absurd statements yesterday against our technical cooperation with the League of Nations, intending to intimidate us. According to government authorities, Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek have already declared our position in a brief telegram, stating that it is purely for the sake of domestic construction. Wang Jingwei plans to give a report on this matter at the Central Memorial Week next Monday. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi stated that Wang Jingwei will make a statement next Monday during the Central Memorial Week regarding the Japanese obstruction of our cooperation with the League of Nations. There is still no definite indication from Feng Yuxiang regarding the Chahar affair. Feng's past attitude has been weak when the Central Government is strong, and strong when the Central Government is weak. Currently, Deng Zhexhi and others are still mediating the situation, and the outcome is unknown. Those around Huang Shaoxiong say that Huang is scheduled to go to Peiping on the evening of the 5th to meet with He Yingqin, convey the proceedings of the Lushan Conference, and assist in handling the Chahar Bureau.

<h3>Deadlock in Negotiations Regarding the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the sixth round of negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which had been postponed, was decided to be held at 2:00 PM on the 4th, judging from the atmosphere beforehand, the claims of both Russia and Manchukuo remain irreconcilable. If the Soviet Union does not withdraw its unrealistic demands, the Manchukuo representative has declared that they will have no choice but to terminate the negotiations and initiate actions necessary for sovereignty. The opinion of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is mediating, is that if the Soviet Union stubbornly adheres to claims that violate the fact of Manchukuo's independence and does not show sincerity, then even if the negotiations are terminated, it cannot be helped. Therefore, the prospects are quite pessimistic. Although there is talk that the Soviet Union will reduce the selling price to 200 million gold rubles, the Manchukuo side considers this to be the Soviet Union's bargaining tactic and is unwilling to discuss it. Therefore, the trend of the sixth meeting is extremely noteworthy. (6th Electric Communications Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Inflation Carried Out Gradually</h3>
<p>To Avoid Causing Violent Monetary Speculation</p>
<p>The Government Has Obtained Satisfactory Cooperation from the Financial Community</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, the US government will take direct inflationary actions when necessary, but will not announce them in advance, because President Roosevelt believes that if an inflationary action on a certain day is announced in advance, it will certainly cause violent speculation. It is believed that the government should avoid abrupt actions that could cause drastic changes in the exchange rate between gold dollars and foreign currencies. Therefore, even if there are inflationary actions, they must be carried out gradually. According to financial sources, credit inflation has been continuous in recent weeks due to the Federal Reserve's purchase of government bonds, but the amount has been small, so it was not easy to detect at first. It was only in the last three weeks that it became gradually more apparent. However, the entire inflation issue depends on whether the economic situation requires it. The US President and his advisors have not changed their policy of not using the power to remonetize gold unless absolutely necessary. At this time, there is a more satisfactory spirit of cooperation between the government and the banking community. Banks have assured the Treasury Department that they will provide the most complete cooperation. The cash reserves of banks outside New York are also increasing daily. It is anticipated that in the coming months, it will be very easy for the government to issue bonds to refinance old debts. (3rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Abandoning Large-Scale Inflation</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to official sources, the US President will not encourage inflation again until the current industrial recovery plan yields results. The recent major change in the Federal Reserve's policy can be regarded as clear evidence of abandoning the policy of using large-scale inflation as a weapon against economic decline. The Federal Reserve, at the beginning of President Roosevelt's term, purchased large amounts of government bonds in the open market, creating a "monetary easing" policy. Initially, it was planned to repurchase $25 million each week, which was implemented for some time, but in recent four weeks, the repurchase amount has been greatly reduced. For example, in the week before this Wednesday, only $10 million was purchased, which is clear evidence. According to those close to the government, President Roosevelt has effectively abandoned the policy of devaluing the gold dollar and adopted a policy of increasing purchasing power through high wages and short working hours.

<h3>Hindrance in the Recovery Movement</h3>

<h3>Seeking a Free Market to Find a Way Out for Gold</h3>
<p>(New York) American gold mine owners, hearing news that some newly produced gold is secretly seeking ways to go abroad, are increasingly eager to promote the establishment of a free gold market. According to their spokesperson, they believe that this market can be realized in September, because completely prohibiting gold exports cannot encourage gold mines to increase production. However, whether a free market can be realized seems to depend on whether the government's plan to issue new debt to repay old debt this month is successful. As for the establishment of a free market, it can instead increase the government's control over gold, because if the price of gold rises to be close to that of London, then there will be no more temptation to circumvent the ban, and this type of market can greatly increase the number of people employed in gold mines.

<h3>Planning to Establish a Federal Agency</h3>
<p>To Protect the Interests of Foreign Debt Bondholders</p>
<p>Hyde Park. US President Roosevelt discussed with Federal Trade Commissioner Stephen today a plan to organize a federal agency to protect the interests of defaulters of foreign debt bonds. It is reported that the President believes that this type of agency should be established by the government to provide free services to bondholders, protecting their interests. In the past, bondholders hired lawyers themselves, which often cost a great deal. If there is a federal agency, then there will be government lawyers to represent them, which can avoid certain losses. (3rd National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reaction in the London Exchange Market</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, due to rumors from New York that the United States would again adopt an inflationary monetary policy, the US dollar fell to $4.58 again, but recovered to $4.525 at the close.

<h3>Russian Oil Dumping in Japan</h3>

Furthermore, an ascetic monk, residing on the banks of the Manorama sacred river in the Waud state, specially sent a representative to present raisins, figs, apples, and apricots to Gandhi, as blessings from the ascetic monk.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Timeliness of the US-Soviet Resumption of Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>The talk of the United States and the Soviet Union resuming diplomatic relations began during the US presidential election last year. Prior to this, the Republican Party's policy had also advocated the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. However, due to various problems hindering it, it could not be realized. First, the debt owed to the United States during the Tsarist era and the Kerensky government era. On the American side, it was believed that the right to debt is sacred and must be paid in full. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, believed that the loan relationship was not legitimate and could not be recognized by the entire Russian people. Both sides were willing to sacrifice the resumption of diplomatic relations rather than give up their claims. They have been at a stalemate for more than ten years. Second, the problem of oil competition. Currently, North America and Alaska are the richest in oil reserves and the most developed in the world. But their advantage over the Soviet Union is only 1.2 billion barrels. Now, American oil fields are being developed more and more widely, and their sales reach all over the world. From Europe in the east to East Asia in the west, all are markets for American oil. The Soviet Union is rising to compete. It not only concentrates on heavy industry but also deeply understands that oil is the source of modern civilization that surpasses coal. Therefore, it has devoted all its efforts to the management of the Baku oil fields. Recently, it has also made great efforts to develop the Eastern European market and the Far Eastern market, engaging in price-cutting competition. It also uses oil diplomacy to seek peace from time to time. Japan's purchase of red oil and the development of the northern Sakhalin peninsula are examples of this. How can the Mobil-related capital, which has creditor-debtor relationships in Baku, sit idly by and not compete? These are all major obstacles to the resumption of US-Soviet diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Recently, American public opinion has become somewhat enlightened. Regarding the debt issue, the American president and the capitalists who rule the United States also largely recognize that debt defaults in the world today are not limited to the Soviet Union alone. Moreover, the debt between the United States and the Soviet Union originally related to the Tsarist era, and its amount is very small compared to war debts. As for oil competition, it depends on its own development capabilities and is only a part of business competition, with little diplomatic significance. If the resumption of diplomatic relations is not successful, then the loss will be borne disproportionately by the United States. Since the deepening of the economic panic in 1929, the world commercial market has been shrinking daily. The only markets that can be developed in the future are the Soviet Union and China in the Far East. Due to the unresolved political issues with the Soviet Union, trade has been greatly affected. Recently, US exports to the Soviet Union have decreased by 85%. Therefore, for the sake of its interests, it has to show concessions and hope that the resumption of diplomatic relations can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the Japanese invasion of North China, the powers have no foothold in the Northeast. Their interests in North China are also in imminent danger. If the World Economic Conference can be relatively successful and international cooperation can be realized to some extent, then the understanding between Britain and the United States will increase, and the opposition between European countries and the United States can also be reduced, thereby curtailing the military atrocities of imperialism. However, the Economic Conference has yielded no results. The basic organization of economic alliances between countries has gone from propaganda to practical application. Therefore, the United States, feeling the difficulty of European countries—especially France—uniting against the United States, and feeling that the Anglo-American understanding is only a verbal agreement, does not dare to be certain that it will be implemented. Japan, in order to maintain its economic territory, advocates pro-American rhetoric, but its honeyed words and dagger hidden in its heart are known to all. Therefore, at this time, the United States, whether politically or economically, cannot help but open up a new path outside of general international relations.</p>
<p>This new path involves breaking all traditional habits within the United States and vigorously implementing economic nationalism, abandoning methods that only benefit a few individuals and implementing reduced working hours and increased wages. Externally, it involves breaking old rigidities and resolutely proposing to recognize the Soviet Union in order to restore normal diplomatic relations. Politically, this may trigger a new situation in the Pacific region, causing Japan to become even more diplomatically isolated. Economically, American manufactured goods will gain a large market, and the Soviet Union's second five-year plan can also receive more technical assistance. Perhaps the re-equilibrium of capitalism will begin here. Therefore, this move by the United States is not only related to the interests of its own country.</p>

<p>(Dalian) Reuters learned today that the prosecutor has decided not to extradite the five Europeans involved in the Sheng'an ship piracy case. The case will be tried in Lushun. The trial period and charges have not yet been announced. According to reliable sources, after preliminary investigation, it is known that the five pirates originally planned to sail the ship to Niuzhuang, but suddenly changed their plan and ordered the second mate, Wang Ying (transliteration), to proceed to Dalian. According to Wang Ying's testimony, the leader of the pirates, the German Tao Di'an, stopped the engine when the Sheng'an was sailing outside Xingpu, trying to hire nearby sampans, but no one responded. The pirates, eager to go ashore, ran the ship aground on the beach and went ashore. Later, as the tide rose, the Sheng'an floated again. Wang Ying tried to steer the ship to a place beyond the pirates' control, but discovered that the ship had hit a reef. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>Claims it is a Private Trip</p>
<p>TASS, Paris, 3rd - Former French Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Party, Herriot, left Paris today, traveling to the Soviet Union via Turkey. Before leaving, Herriot told reporters that his purpose in going to the Soviet Union was to familiarize himself with the situation there. He also said that he believed he must familiarize himself with the Soviet situation in a personal capacity and establish private friendly relations. He emphasized that this trip was a private trip and said, "I will do nothing but observe, study, and talk." This trip is Herriot's first to the Soviet Union in his life. The general public is particularly interested in this French politician's trip to Russia, because when he was French Prime Minister, he recognized the Soviet government and signed the Franco-Soviet non-aggression pact.</p>
<p>Havas, Marseille, 3rd - The leader of the Radical Socialist Party (the current ruling party) and former Prime Minister Herriot departed at 3 PM today, traveling by sea to Istanbul, Turkey. Accompanying him were six members of the French Parliament and Mrs. Poirot, Vice Chairman of the Radical Socialist Party, all of whom are going to the capital of Bulgaria to participate in the work of the international consultation meeting of the Radical Party, the Democratic Party, and other similar parties. Herriot will take the opportunity to visit Ankara, the capital of Turkey, and then visit Russia. He is expected to arrive in Istanbul next Wednesday.

<h3>German Aircraft Flying Over Austria Incident</h3>
<p>Various Countries Prepare to Negotiate with Germany</p>
<p>Germany Believes it Will Only Increase the Seriousness of the Situation</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 4th - Berlin newspapers expressed opposition to the proposal that the major powers should negotiate with Germany regarding the German aircraft flying over Austria to propagandize and Germany using radio broadcasts to conduct anti-Austrian propaganda. The Frankfurter Zeitung stated, "The above are not international events. The major powers negotiating with Germany will not improve the situation, but will only make it more serious."</p>
<p>Havas, London, 4th - Official sources claim that London and Rome are currently exchanging views on what procedures should be taken to negotiate with the German government regarding the German aircraft invading Austria. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the Four-Power Pact or the Treaty of Versailles will be invoked for this matter, and it is also unknown when this negotiation will be launched. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is currently on vacation and will not return to Rome until the beginning of next week. As for the British side, it believes that this issue is not directly related to Britain, so Britain should not get involved in the vortex.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 3rd - The British, French, and Italian governments have now begun consultations on the German aircraft invading Austrian territory and distributing pamphlets attacking the Austrian Dolfuss government. According to information obtained by the London Times, the three governments believe that the German aircraft invading Austrian territory and distributing leaflets attacking the government of a neighboring country are not in accordance with the spirit of international conventions. This opinion is expected to be delivered to the German government within a day or two.</p>
<p>Havas, Prague, 3rd - According to authoritative sources, the French government intends to negotiate with the Berlin government regarding the German aircraft flying into Austrian territory for propaganda purposes and has notified the governments of Czechoslovakia and the other two countries of the Little Entente (Romania and Yugoslavia) of this intention. The Czech Foreign Ministry has filed the notification, but there are no current plans for Czechoslovakia to formally negotiate with the German government.</p>
<h3>Italy Unifies National Defense Policy</h3>
<p>Mussolini Holds Sole Military Power</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 3rd - It now seems confirmed that Prime Minister Mussolini has re-adopted the old theory of unifying national defense affairs, concentrating control of the army and all military forces in his own hands. It is rumored that the current Director-General of the Navy, Admiral Sciappini, will soon take office as Commander of the Fleet, while the Commander of the First Fleet, Pucoli, will resume his position as Undersecretary of the Navy. The above news should be treated with extreme caution, as it is extremely difficult to completely reorganize the administrative relations between the national military forces, and there are currently no signs to predict that Mussolini will do so imminently. However, today's Gazzetta del Popolo published an editorial explaining the reasons for unifying national defense policy, and its arguments were quite insightful. The newspaper believes that the issue of national defense policy "should be comprehensively resolved in accordance with the pan-fascist principles represented by Prime Minister Mussolini. The German military concept is to have military power wielded by professional military officers,不受政權之節制,而反之汎繫主義之觀念,則係一種「純粹政治性質之新法」主張,用軍事敎育及團體組織之法,使公民之軍事活動及其編入行伍,成爲一種永久職責,俾將隔離國民與軍隊一切之障礙,予以澈底删除,」 But the establishment of a General Staff Headquarters subject to the control of the head of government has not yet been put into practice. The newspaper calls for (1) making political common sense able to control narrow military technical knowledge, (2) making the air force completely independent, (3) giving the Supreme Staff greater authority, (4) saving money and shortening the term of conscription, and compensating for it with better military training. The entire text makes no mention of the air force, which is also quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Treaty on Maritime Security</h3>
<p>Applicable to the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Reuters, The Hague, 3rd - The treaty on maritime life security, concluded in London on May 31, 1929, was passed by the Dutch government today and is applicable to the Dutch East Indies. In its explanatory note, the Dutch government stated that the original obstacles preventing the London Treaty from being applied to the Dutch East Indies after the establishment of the Westra Ordinance in 1931 have been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Strange Indian Wedding Customs</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bombay Correspondent - Indians have a superstition that anyone who marries a woman for the third time will be doomed to misfortune. If they first perform a mock wedding ceremony with a tree, their life can be preserved. The tree is usually a banana tree or the like. The ceremony is the same as a real wedding. They bow to the tree, wrap yellow cotton thread around the trunk, place women's clothing and accessories near the tree, and sprinkle water around the tree three times. The groom and the "tree bride" still follow the normal etiquette, setting up a curtain as a barrier. All the necklaces worn by married women are tied to the tree by the groom's hand. After the ceremony is completed, the tree is cut down, divided into two sections, placed together and burned, and a funeral is held. After the mock wedding, the real wedding is performed again, which is the fourth marriage. Thus, the groom can avoid sudden death.</p>
<h3>Turkey Expels British侨</h3>
<p>Representative of Vickers Company</p>
<p>Reason Not Announced</p>
<p>Suspected of Espionage</p>
<p>Reuters, Istanbul (Former Turkish Capital), 3rd - Today, Land, the British representative of Vickers Company, was expelled from the country by the Turkish authorities. The reason was not announced. Land was escorted to the border by Turkish secret agents. According to what he told Reuters reporters, he really did not know why he was expelled. According to reports, Land only returned to Turkey from London this Sunday. Yesterday, he arrived at the Ankara General Office, when the police visited and ordered him to go to Istanbul immediately. As soon as he arrived there, he was taken to the police station and ordered to leave the country immediately, but the reason has not yet been announced. It is reported that Vickers Company's trade with the Turkish government has always been friendly. The company has signed many contracts with the Turkish government, including the construction of six seaplanes, which are about to be completed. At the same time, five Vickers Company aircraft installers and two experts are currently here to install the anti-aircraft guns purchased by the Turkish government from the company last year. It is now believed that Land also represents other firms similar to Vickers Company. Reuters, London, 3rd - Officials at Vickers Company in London told Reuters reporters today that the company had not received any telegrams regarding Land's expulsion from Turkey, and the reason was also unknown.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 4th - When Land, the representative of the British Vickers-Armstrong Arms Company, returned to Ankara from London, he was presented with an expulsion order signed by the Turkish government by the police and escorted to the Bulgarian border. The reason was not explained. According to semi-official sources, Mr. Land is suspected of being involved in espionage work for another country. At that time, the British consul tried to delay the execution of the order, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>Mid-Western Levee Breach in the United States Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Residents Awaken in Dreams</p>
<p>5,000 People Abandon Homes to Seek Refuge</p>
<p>Reuters, Denver, 3rd - The Garsel Hood Dam on the Smith Pulaite River in Colorado, USA (40 miles from Denver), collapsed tonight, forcing up to 5,000 residents to abandon their homes and seek refuge. Material losses amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Residents awakened from their dreams and fled in their sleepwear. Police and firefighters bravely provided rescue, and many residents were rescued by their efforts. However, many were still unable to escape. The city's bridges were washed away, and power lines were cut. Business has now stopped. When the river first broke through the levee, fire trucks raced through the streets, sounding alarms to wake up residents. It is reported that several gold miners mining under the levee have gone missing.</p>

<h3>Japanese Bureaucratic Infighting Causes Cabinet Disputes</h3>
<p>Saito Asks Takahashi to Mediate</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 4th - Due to the Seiyukai and Minseito parties vying for colonial territories, the fate of the Japanese government is temporarily in danger. Prime Minister Saito ordered Secretary-General Horikiri to go to Hayama to ask Finance Minister Takahashi to come to Tokyo to mediate. Finance Minister Takahashi responded to the invitation and came to Tokyo to participate in the cabinet meeting. The Seiyukai-affiliated cabinet members then relented, and the colonial official reshuffle issue was passed by the cabinet meeting according to the original plan. Finance Minister Takahashi went to Hayama again at 5 PM to recuperate.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 4th - The Japanese Cabinet meeting convened at 11:30 AM this morning. Finance Minister Takahashi urged Minister of Overseas Affairs Minami and Minister of Education Hatoyama to concede, but both refused. They then argued on the cabinet table. Minister of Education Hatoyama accused Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai of transferring officials for party interests, such as transferring Matsuda, Director of the South Seas Agency, to the Korean Monopoly Bureau because of party strategy. The transfer of Hayashi, Chief of the Police Affairs Bureau of the Kwantung Government, to Director of the South Seas Agency and the transfer of Yoshita, Director of the Taiwan Colonial Production Bureau, to Director of the Finance Bureau of the Kwantung Government were all transfers for party interests. Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai refuted Minister of Education Hatoyama's misunderstandings, and the argument continued until 12:30 PM, when the meeting was suspended. Prime Minister Saito was then left to decide. After the adjournment, Prime Minister Saito invited Minister of the Interior Yamamoto and Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Goto to secretly discuss countermeasures. The meeting reconvened at 2 PM. Prime Minister Saito ruled that the decision would be made according to the original plan. Ministers Hatoyama and Minami still disagreed, and the dispute continued until 4:20 PM, when the decision was made according to the original plan.</p>
<h3>Mutinying Troops of Zheng's Department Flee Through Zijing Pass</h3>
<p>Baoding Has No Troops to Intercept, and They Escape</p>
<p>Local Losses Exceed 500,000</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch - The temporarily compiled 1st Security Division of Zheng Guilin, consisting of two infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, and one special service regiment, totaling approximately 2,000 rifles, 200 horses, and about 3,000 personnel, has mutinied three times due to the lack of discipline among the soldiers. They broke into three groups and fled, harassing and looting along the way. Initially, Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, returned to Tianjin from Beiping and asked He Zhuguo how to deal with Zheng's department (because Zheng was under He's command). Yu said that if no plans were made early, it would eventually become a chronic problem. He replied that he would ask the Beiping Military Branch for instructions. After Yu arrived in Tianjin, he received a report of the second mutiny of Zheng's department. Yu immediately telegraphed to transfer two infantry battalions of the 640th Regiment of the 114th Division of Chen Guanqun and two cavalry companies of Zhang Chengde's division to track and pursue them, and also telegraphed Qian Dajun, Director of the Baoding Headquarters, to send troops to intercept them. Unexpectedly, Baoding had no troops to dispatch. As a last resort, three companies were sent from the special service battalion (originally serving as the headquarters guard) and encountered the mutinying troops along the Zulong River in Gaoyang County. Due to a flash flood, they were separated by the river, and neither side could cross it. At that time, the mutinying troops had few remaining bullets and were about to be captured when their ammunition ran out. Unexpectedly, the special service battalion requested a large number of ammunition from Baoding, which was loaded onto four heavy trucks. Due to the many places where the road was flooded, they had to detour and went astray due to the tall crops, and were intercepted by Zheng's sentries. Before long, Zheng Guilin personally led the remnants of about 1,500-1,600 people (the third mutiny) to arrive, and their strength greatly increased. They then detoured through Lixian and Wangdu, crossed the railway line, and entered Yixian via the border between Wanxian and Mancheng. Recently, they fled out of Zijing Pass from Yixian. Judging from their purpose, they will take the road to Zhuolu to enter the territory of Chahar. According to reports, Zheng's remnants have merged with the first and second groups of fleeing troops in Yixian, with a total of more than 2,000 people, 150-160 horses, 1,700 rifles, more than ten mortars, and more than ten machine guns. When Zheng's department fled to Gaoyang, He Zhuguo immediately dispatched the entire Miao Chengliu Division by train to Pinghan Road to encircle and suppress them. Unexpectedly, when the Miao Division arrived in Baoding, Zheng's department had already crossed the railway line and fled into the mountains, and they could not catch up. Also, before the Miao Division set out, Yu Xuezhong had already predicted that they would definitely flee to Chahar Province and telegraphed to request the Jin army's Li Fuying Division to send troops to assist in the suppression. Li's department had already arrived in Laiyuan, Hebei Province, but because He Zhuguo had already dispatched the Miao Division, Li's department retreated to Lingqiu. According to statistics, the counties and towns harassed by Zheng's department include Qingxian, Jinghai, Renqiu, Dacheng, Hejian, Gaoyang, Lixian, Wangdu, Dingxian, Mancheng, and Yixian. Local losses are estimated to be over 500,000 yuan, and the exact amount cannot be ascertained for the time being. However, some victimized villages and towns have already submitted requests to the county government, which will be forwarded to the provincial government, requesting compensation.

<h3>He Yingqin Discusses Three Measures Regarding the Chahar Situation</h3>
<p>Central Army and Feng's Army Confront Each Other in Xinzhuang</p>
<p>The Central Government Still Advocates Peace, Hoping Feng Will Realize the Situation</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping: Following the Lushan Conference, Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek jointly issued a circular telegram on the 28th, proposing four suggestions regarding the Chahar situation. Feng Yuxiang also issued a circular telegram on the 31st, completely rejecting Wang and Chiang's four suggestions, using extremely激昂 language, creating a sharp contrast with Wang and Chiang's telegram. After Feng's telegram arrived in Beiping, He Yingqin immediately telegraphed Wang and Chiang, requesting instructions. A meeting was held by the Military Affairs Commission yesterday morning to discuss the matter. Due to the importance of the matter, a decision will be made after Wang and Chiang's response arrives. Last night, Chiang's telegram arrived in Beiping, still advocating a peaceful resolution and not seeking the final effective measures unless absolutely necessary. Today (the 3rd), He Yingqin, based on the instructions in the telegram, has drafted three measures to be implemented immediately. Huang Fu will also leave Beiping by special train at 10:15 tonight (the 3rd) to visit Chiang in Lushan for further discussions.</p>
<p>On the Ping-Sui Railway, since the interruption of train service, the situation has become more tense. The two sides are confronting each other in the area of Xinzhuangzi. The Central Army's Wang Jingjiu and Guan Linzheng's units are at the front line. Pang Bingxun has taken over as the commander of the Tenth Army Corps, commanding the various armies in Shacheng. Xu Tingyao accompanied Pang's deputy army commander Ma Fafu to Shacheng last night to meet with Pang and discuss military affairs. Regarding the Chahar Province situation, Liu Guitang's troops began moving south from Guyuan in late last month and have now reached the area of Chicheng Longguan. Sun Liangcheng has also arrived in Chicheng to join Liu Guitang, attempting to cut off the rear route to Yanqing Nankou. Xuanhua is being defended by Fang Zhenwu's troops. This afternoon, a Mr. Hou from the staff office of the Military Affairs Commission took a chartered train north on the Ping-Sui Railway, reportedly under orders to go to Chahar. After arriving in Shacheng, he will proceed to Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>He Yingqin spoke freely to reporters about the Chahar situation this afternoon (the 3rd), stating, "The Central Government has always adhered to the principle of peace regarding the Chahar situation, proceeding with caution. I have been feeling a headache because Mr. Feng's attitude is unpredictable and difficult to deal with. The Chahar issue is originally a very simple problem, but it has been delayed without resolution. The Chinese people can all yield to external forces, but why can't they make concessions internally? Thinking of this, I feel extremely saddened and indignant. After President Wang and Chairman Chiang issued a circular telegram a few days ago, putting forward four suggestions regarding the Chahar situation, Mr. Feng issued a world telegram, in which he stated that the recovery of Duolun, Guyuan, Kangbao, Baochang, and the reception of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau followed by raising the national flag,</p>
<p>(Northeast Newsreel Film Tianjin Branch)</p>
<p>were achievements in resisting Japan. However, except for the puppet troops of Li Shouchun in Duolun, who are the enemies in Guyuan, Bao Kang, and other places? The world telegram also stated that the Central Government does not want Song Mingxuan (Zheyuan) to return to Chahar, which is a complete distortion of the facts. On June 17th, the Military and Political Affairs Committee issued an order urging Song to return to Chahar, which is on record. Mr. Feng's world telegram's proposition is very strong, but he also hinted to the generals at the front that they can accept the four principles. His attitude is very moderate. What is his true intention? It is difficult to grasp. Someone told me that Mr. Feng is very willing to accept the four principles, but the world telegram is a public expression, and he has no choice but to do so. In fact, if there are flexible solutions, it will not be an obstacle. If so, it would truly be a blessing for the country. The Central Government has always advocated peace for Chahar, and only hopes that Mr. Feng will realize the situation as soon as possible. A moment ago, I had already drafted three measures, and I will directly telegraph Mr. Feng or send a representative to negotiate. The three measures are: (1) I hope Feng will consider the difficulties of the country and abolish his title as soon as possible. At this time, local actions against foreign countries will not only not help the situation, but will also harm the country. In addition, the chaos of</p>
<p>recruiting bandits and disturbing public order will lead to endless troubles. It is appropriate to shrink it early to prevent Chahar Province from becoming a continuation of Rehe. (2) Let Song Zheyuan return to Chahar, and Feng will move the mixed troops in the Zhang Xuan area to the north to facilitate reorganization. Because the mixed troops of each unit have moved south and are scattered near the Zhangjiakou Xuanhua Railway, and the discipline is not good, extorting at will, and the people are not living well. Song's return to Chahar will be difficult to deal with, so they must be transferred to a considerable location for reorganization to avoid hindering Song's return to Chahar. (3) After Feng's troops withdraw from Zhang Xuan and before Song Zheyuan returns to office, Tong Linge will maintain the transitional public order in the name of the Chahar Garrison Commander. Tong is a confidant of Feng, and the Military Affairs Commission previously appointed Tong as the Chahar Province Garrison Commander, which is quite appropriate. The above three measures are extremely simple, and I hope Mr. Feng can follow them immediately. In short, the government will use peaceful methods to solve the Chahar issue and will never want to create additional complications and cause further worries about the future of the country. Currently, the military and political affairs of Chahar Province are in chaos. Feng has appointed more than 20 division commanders. As long as a thousand or hundreds of people can be recruited, they can earn the title of division commander. If this continues, how can it be tolerated? Recently, a representative of Fang Zhenwu came to Beiping, expressing that Fang has become somewhat aware and hopes that the government will give him a corresponding title. Fang's main forces are divided into two units. One unit is led by Bao Gang, which has been reorganized into the 45th Brigade with a monthly salary of 25,000. The other unit, led by Zhang Renjie, has also been reorganized into a brigade and has received the seal of office," (August 3rd).</p>
<h3>Lushan Conference Decides on Air Force Construction</h3>
<p>Creating a Minimum Self-Defense Capability Within Three Years</p>
<p>Implementing the National Air Defense Drill Plan</p>
<p>Establishing an Air Defense Association and Provincial Branches</p>
<p>A dispatch from the capital: Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Administration, considering that our country's air force is still in its infancy, drafted a three-year air force construction plan and planned air defense facilities. Xu took it to the Lushan Conference for discussion, and it was decided to implement it after discussion. Xu returned to Beijing on the 2nd and is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 4th to attend the second standing committee meeting of the Aviation Construction Association to be held in Shanghai on the 6th. After staying in Shanghai for five days, he will go to Hangzhou to handle official duties. Xu spoke to visitors at the Beijing Aviation Administration Office yesterday about the process of the Lushan Conference's discussion of air force construction and the preparation for air defense. The outline is as follows:</p>
<h3>Equal Emphasis on Land and Air</h3>
<p>Xu said, "Aviation construction is advancing rapidly in various countries, competing with each other. However, our country has not paid attention to air force equipment in the past. After the Japanese invasion of Shanghai and the fall of the eastern provinces, the people woke up as if from a dream and realized that the air force is the only weapon in modern warfare. Therefore, they have risen up to promote it. However, the trend of modern international affairs is to make the air force the main force, and the army has become an auxiliary force. If our country does not catch up quickly, we will</p>
<p>only be able to wait for death in the event of another enemy invasion. Therefore, after taking office, I drafted an air force construction plan, which must create a minimum degree of self-defense capability within three years. Later, when the Lushan Conference opened, I was also summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to participate and presented the proposed plan for discussion. At that time, everyone felt that the funding required was too large and there were many difficulties. However, after my strong advocacy and explanation that our country has spent 300 million yuan on the army every year for 40 years, while the air force's regular expenses were only 700,000 yuan in 1927, and even now it is only more than 2 million yuan per year, a huge difference, after several days of discussion, it was finally decided that after this, although our country's air force equipment cannot keep pace with various countries, at least the land and air forces will proceed in parallel. As for the content of this plan, due to military secrets, I am unable to tell you.</p>
<p>(Air Defense Preparation) Air defense preparation is necessary for air force construction. It is now scheduled to start in September this year and end by the end of next year. During these 16 months, there will be a training period. It is planned to start the first air defense drill in the capital in November next year. The period of the Shanghai exercise will be in 1935, and then it will be promoted to various important cities. However, the personnel are quite difficult due to the current lack of institutions for cultivating talents. In the future, as the scope expands, the personnel of our department alone will not be able to meet the needs. It is necessary to cooperate effectively with the police and military police schools, and the masses should also receive training in air defense drills. Therefore, it cannot be held without a considerable period of preparation. In various countries, such as Rome and Tokyo, it takes more than a year to prepare for each air defense drill. The first step is to establish an air defense training class to train air defense cadres and instructors, and then train the police, military police, and the people, so that all the people of the country have common sense and skills in air defense to avoid the danger of being caught off guard in the event of an air war. The air defense training class is now being actively prepared and is scheduled to be officially established on September 1st to start training. In the work of air defense, disinfection and fire fighting are particularly important. (1) In wartime, the public should prepare for disinfection and defense in advance. (2) Regarding firefighting equipment, such as the installation of tap water pipes, it must be deeper than three meters to avoid damage from 100-pound bombs. Otherwise, if the tap water pipes are destroyed by enemy planes, the houses will be burned down during the war and cannot be saved. I will discuss the installation of tap water pipes with the municipal government authorities. It is best to install double pipes to ensure safety. Other facilities, such as building underground rooms, are extensive and cannot be described in detail at one time." Xu said at the end that the National Aviation Construction Association will hold a standing meeting this month on the 6th. The association plans to propose the establishment of an Air Defense Association. The general association will be set up in our department, and branches will be set up in various provinces and cities to arouse the attention of the people of the country to air defense," (Daily News).</p>
<h3>Officers of the Bandit Suppression Army Rotate to Lushan for Training</h3>
<p>New Military School Built at Haihui Temple</p>
<p>More Than 60 Instructors</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang: Chiang's stationing in Lushan this time to plan the suppression of the Red Army is considering everything from the root. For example, there are also various reforms for the army itself. All bandit suppression troops from Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces must be rotated to Lushan for training, and a large-scale military school will be built at Haihui Temple in Lushan, with 12 classrooms, each of which can accommodate 300 people. The school was built by the Jiangxi Highway Bureau with hundreds of workers in two days. Those who used to have classes in the open air have now moved into the school. This is the first phase, with more than 1,400 students and more than 60 instructors, and several German consultants. Chen Cheng is the head of the training group, and Chiang also personally comes to give speeches, observe exercises, and climb mountains from time to time, which is extremely strict. Because the students are all real military officers and the training period is short, they graduate in two weeks. After graduation, they still return to their original units. After this class graduates, the division and brigade commanders will draw another batch, so that all officers will be trained. Currently, He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the Western Route, has sent a batch of students, preparing to be included in the second phase of training," (July 31st).</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Red Bandits on the Border Area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Retreat to Eastern Hubei</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Sends Troops to Encircle and Suppress, Sun's Troops Take the Main Force. A Plan to Revive the Countryside is Drawn Up and Implemented Regionally. A dispatch from Hankou: The remnants of the Red bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui take advantage of the mountains and move to and fro, and have not been completely eliminated for a long time. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially appointed Liu Zhenhua as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the border areas, stationed in Hanchuan, and responsible for complete suppression. All 14 counties in the Henan region, including Jingfu, Shangcheng, Gushi, Guangshan, Hanchuan, Luoshan, the Hubei region, including Lishan, Yingshan, Luotian, Macheng, Huang'an, and the Anhui region, including Lihuang, Liu'an, and Huoshan, are all designated as bandit suppression areas. At the beginning of Liu's tenure, he formulated a plan to implement in three phases, each phase lasting one month. A general suppression was launched a month ago to break the main forces of the Red bandits, the 24th, 25th, and 28th armies, one by one. Important bandit nests such as Wangjiawan, Guojiahe, Shuangshanguan, Jianchanghe, and Tuanshugang have all been recovered. The Red bandits, seeing the power of the National Army, had no other choice but to retreat to eastern Hubei with all their strength. Their most recent gathering place is in the mountains near Songbu in Macheng County, but they have not yet made any attempts. In order to completely eliminate them, Liu Zhenhua has ordered Sun Lianzhong, Liang Guanying, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, Wan Yaohuang, and other troops to encircle and suppress them together. Sun's troops, originally stationed in Songbu, will take the main force. The number of people and guns of the Red bandits could not be known in detail, but it is certain that they are the elite. The bandit leaders Lu Huanxian, Liao Rongkun, and Shen Zemin are reportedly all in the army. If they can be wiped out in one fell swoop, then capturing the leader will capture the king, and all the bandit areas can be settled with a proclamation.</p>
<p>The counties in the border area are rich in agricultural products and can be called a blessed land. They have suffered from banditry for many years, and the countryside has been destroyed beyond recognition. The Border Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters has drawn up a plan to revive the countryside, using the method of organizing the people to strengthen self-defense forces, and the purpose of implementing land reclamation to solve the land problem. The first step is to organize the "Revive the Countryside Protection Team." It will be implemented in zones in the 14 counties of Jingfu and others. Detailed measures have been drafted, with a total of 14 articles, which are recorded as follows: (1) In order to implement land reclamation and consolidate the local area, the Headquarters will organize the Revive the Countryside Protection Team in various recovered Red areas to lay the foundation for land distribution based on population; (2) The Protection Team's land reclamation area will be divided into several areas according to military progress and geographical conditions; (3) The Protection Team's formation will be ten people in a squad, with one squad leader, three squads in a platoon, with one platoon leader, three platoons in a company, with one company commander, five companies in a battalion, with one battalion commander; (4) The Protection Team will be compiled by the Headquarters from a part of the armed people's groups in each county designated by the Headquarters; (5) There will be one head of the joint team in the land reclamation area, who will be appointed by the Headquarters, and the leaders of each level of the team will be appointed by the Headquarters upon presentation by the head of the joint team; (6) The Protection Team's current task in the land reclamation area is to harvest rice with weapons. During the busy harvest season, each team of warriors should be accompanied by two or three deputy farmers, each carrying farm tools, to help with the harvest, and to defend the people. They can carry out various tasks such as building stockades, building bunkers, repairing roads, and preventing bandits; (7) The scope of rice harvesting in the land reclamation area will be determined by the head of the joint team, together with the county government and the leaders of each level of the team, level by level, down to the squad. After the harvest boundaries are determined, they will be listed and submitted to the Headquarters for approval and promulgation for implementation; (8) Of the rice harvested by the Protection Team at each level, 80% will be used by the team, 10% will be used for the office expenses of each level of team headquarters, and 10% will be used as relief funds for accommodating Red bandit refugees (it is estimated that each team of warriors, with two or three people harvesting rice, can harvest 300 catties of rice per day. Calculated on a 10-day harvest period, they can harvest 3,000 catties of rice. According to 80%, each team of warriors will receive 2,400 catties of rice); (9) Half of the rice obtained by the aforementioned Protection Team, 80%, will be distributed to each team as a harvest bonus, and half will be retained for the team's supply. The rice retained for supply will be managed by another Grain Committee and distributed monthly; (10) The Grain Management Committee will be organized by one person elected from the battalion headquarters and each company headquarters, with one chairman elected by the committee members; (11) When the Protection Team moves into the Red area, before the rice is harvested, each person will be given 4 yuan of supplies, the battalion commander will be given 12 yuan, the company commander will be given 8 yuan, and the platoon commander will be given 6 yuan, limited to one time. Those who are compiled from the guerrilla team security team with salaries are exempt from payment; (12) After the Headquarters completes the bandit suppression, the Protection Team will submit a report to the Joint Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces for approval of land distribution based on population; (13) In addition to the supervision and command of the head of the joint team and the county government, the Headquarters will send one instructor to each area to provide guidance at any time; (14) Bonus distribution standards: 1. Each team of warriors is calculated as one person; 2. Each squad leader is calculated as 1.5 people; 3. Each platoon leader is calculated as 3 people; 4. Each company commander is calculated as 5 people; 5. Each battalion commander is calculated as 10 people. Regarding the rural land issue, Commander-in-Chief Chiang once issued regulations and issued an order to the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui on October 6th last year to comply with them. The regulations for protecting owners, self-cultivating farmers, tenant farmers, hired farmers, and reconciling the interests of all levels are very detailed. On the 10th, he also issued regulations for land reclamation in the bandit area, clarifying the principle of turning soldiers into farmers and supporting soldiers with agriculture. Although the methods proposed by Liu are different, the ultimate goal is the same," (August 3rd).</p>
<h3>Sun Tonggang Arrives in Ji'nan</h3>
<p>Met with Rain in Yanzhou, Arrived in Ji'nan One Day Late Will Stay in Ji'nan Briefly to Make National Flights</p>
<p>A dispatch from Ji'nan: Aviator Sun Tonggang left Jiangxi on the 1st and came to Ji'nan to visit relatives. It was originally scheduled to arrive that night, but he encountered rain in Yanzhou and had to return to Xuzhou, staying overnight. Yesterday (the 2nd) morning at about 7 o'clock, after first inquiring about the weather in Ji'nan by telephone, he left Xuzhou and flew north at 9:30 in the morning. Passing through Yanzhou, he was warmly welcomed by the local people, so he flew around the city of Yanzhou several times, continued north, and at 11:30, amid cheers from the crowd, he landed safely at Zhangzhuang Airport. Hearing that Han Fuju was concerned, he flew to the city and soared for three weeks before returning to Zhangzhuang to greet the welcoming personnel. He then returned to his private residence on Weijiu Road for a short rest, and then accompanied his brother, the 20th Division Commander Sun Tongxuan, to the provincial government to meet with Han Fuju. Han praised and encouraged Sun, and this morning (the 3rd) at 10 o'clock, he held a banquet for Sun at the Jinde Hall to welcome him. The details of Sun's arrival in Ji'nan are as follows:</p>
<p>The Security Team That Received the War Zone Arrives in Tangshan (Northeast Newsreel Film Tianjin Branch)</p>
<p>(The grand occasion of welcome from all walks of life) Those who came to the venue to welcome him today included personnel from party, government, and military agencies and groups, and eight companies of the 81st Division were on guard at the venue, with Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division, serving as the chief welcome commander. The venue was very lively, and the audience standing outside the airport was even more crowded, numbering about a thousand people. At 11:30, a black shadow was glimpsed soaring on the western mountain, and the crowd followed from the grove and stood in the field, looking south with their heads raised. Then the plane gradually flew lower, and the sound of its wheels could be heard. At that time, the military music played loudly, and the welcoming crowd applauded. The plane flew to the venue, rising and falling several times near the ground, and flying around the field several times, making various poses. At that time, the plane was very low to the ground. Sun was sitting in the plane, driving with one hand and saluting the crowd on the ground with the other hand. Finally, it landed slowly. After the plane stopped, Sun's third brother, Tongfeng, and Sun's adjutant first stepped forward and shook hands with Sun. After a long separation, they were overjoyed and shed tears. The brothers talked briefly. When Sun was about to take off again to fly to the city, his father, Sun Jingsan, rushed to the front of the plane, holding his hand tightly and not letting go, his old tears streaming down like a stream. Sun was also filled with both sadness and joy. Then his family members all arrived at the front of the plane, and Sun got off the plane to meet his mother, sister-in-law, and nephews. Sun was wearing yellow shorts, a white silk shirt, light green sports socks, and yellow leather shoes, with a copper basin hat on his head. He was full of energy. Although he had traveled a long distance, he showed no signs of fatigue. Sun then took three bouquets of flowers from the plane and gave them to his mother and his second sister-in-law. The plane stopped at the field for about 20 minutes. Sun's father urged him to fly to the city for a week first because Chairman Han was very concerned. So at 11:50, he took off again and flew around Ji'nan City for three weeks, and the citizens all expressed their welcome. At 12:20 in the afternoon, Sun flew back to Zhangzhuang Airport again, landing from the west and coming from the east. Sun got off the plane, took off his hat, and shook hands with his family members and welcoming representatives one by one to greet them. When he was in the Northwest Army's Second Division in 1925, the division commander was Han Fuju, and the battalion commander was Zhan Shutang. Today, old friends meet again, and they are especially happy. Sun then went to the airport and told reporters that he had flown north from Nanchang yesterday and was scheduled to arrive in Ji'nan at 5 o'clock that night. When he passed Xuzhou and arrived in Yanzhou, he suddenly encountered a thunderstorm and had to return to Xuzhou. At 9:30 this morning, he left Xuzhou and flew north. The air pressure was still low, so he flew in the high air space of 1,700 meters, and the scenery below was vast and not very clear. After crossing the Yellow River, he began to descend below the clouds and knew that he had passed Ji'nan, so he turned back. After the conversation, he was invited by his father and brothers to leave the airport and go to his residence on Weijiu Road to rest.</p>
<p>(Han Holds a Banquet to Welcome Him) Sun, led by his brother, the 20th Division Commander Sun Tongxuan, went to the provincial government at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon to meet Han Fuju. Han asked about his study in Germany and his journey back to China. Sun described it in detail. Han praised him greatly. He did not leave until 4 o'clock. Today, Sun went to various places to thank all circles for their warm welcome and visited the German Consul in Ji'nan, Higu Xian, and the British Consul, Harding. The British Consul especially expressed his admiration for Sun as an outstanding talent in Chinese aviation. He then visited Hu Xi, a British manager of the Asia Company. At 10 o'clock in the morning, he went to the Jinde Hall to attend a banquet hosted by Han Fuju, accompanied by party, military, and political dignitaries. During the banquet, Sun gave a simple speech, expressing his gratitude, and everyone left happily. After the banquet, he visited Wen Chenglie, the mayor of Ji'nan. Tomorrow</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>(The 4th) The heads of various departments of the provincial government will hold another banquet to welcome Sun. Sun told visitors, "My first step of the Euro-Asian flight has been completed. I plan to inspect the plane and repair it for a long time, and then make a second step of national flight. After the national flight, I will donate this plane to the central government, and then make a third step of world flight. My ultimate goal is to set up a factory to manufacture airplanes myself and devote myself to the national air defense. As for when I will return to Germany, it has not yet been scheduled," (August 3rd).</p>
<h3>Strengthening National Defense in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Expansion of National Defense Construction Committee</p>
<p>Increased Aircraft Fleet and Ordered Warships</p>
<p>Building Defensive Fortifications in the Northeast and Along the River</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After the establishment of the Guangdong National Defense Construction Committee, Chairman Chen Jitang considered the construction of national defense fortresses a matter of utmost urgency, especially the construction design. Recently, he specially recruited talents from various fields to form a staff office for the National Defense Committee to plan major projects. The First Group Army Headquarters dispatched Colonel Staff Officer Sheng Kechang and Liu Yanfan, the Air Force Headquarters dispatched Guan Guanyi and Liu Guozhen, the Fleet Headquarters dispatched Feng Ding, and the Humen Fortress Commander dispatched Wu Zhu, totaling six people as staff officers of the staff office. The staff office has two sections: general affairs and engineering, each with three units, and has already started working. On the 18th of this month, the National Defense Committee also established a purchasing committee, with Miao Peinan, Chief of Staff of the First Group Army Headquarters, concurrently serving as Chairman of the Purchasing Committee, and He Luo, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Li Jiezhi, Commander of the Humen Fortress, and Tang Haoqing, Chief of Staff of the First Group Army Headquarters, serving as members. In addition, to gather ideas from various sources, more than 20 foreign technical experts, mostly from Germany and the United States, were hired as senior consultants to the National Defense Committee, concurrently serving as instructors in military and political schools and aviation school coaches, with a monthly salary of several thousand yuan per person. In recent months, preparations have been made for national defense construction, and after repeated meetings, specific measures have been formulated, roughly divided into three parts: 1. Increase the purchase of aircraft and anti-aircraft equipment, develop flying fields in various places, and equip anti-aircraft guns; 2. Add warships to consolidate coastal defense; 3. Build fortresses and deploy defensive fortifications. The first two items are directly ordered from foreign countries. Recently, aircraft have been shipped to Guangdong in batches. As for the warships ordered in a certain country, it will take time to manufacture and complete the transaction. Regarding the third item, the gun emplacements of Humen Fortress will be repaired first, and the gun emplacements in Shantou in the east and Haikou in the south have also been decided to be repaired in stages or new gun emplacements will be added. The estimated cost of all projects has been prepared and submitted to the authorities for approval and allocation under the National Defense Public Bond funds. Construction work is expected to begin around August. In addition, due to the importance of defense, defensive fortifications are also being built in the northeast of Guangdong Province. The defensive fortifications in the border areas of the East River, such as Meixian, Pingyuan, Jiaoling, Xunwu, Sanbiao Xu, Liuche Xu, and Datao Xu, which are adjacent to Fujian and Jiangxi, are limited to two months to complete, and the commander of the Second Column is responsible for supervising the construction. Recently, a large number of lead wires, triangular nails, and other materials have been shipped from the province to Jiaoling by the Second Transportation Station for distribution and use. As for Shaoguan in the Beijiang area, it is an important passage from Jiangxi and Hunan to Guangdong, and special attention must be paid to defensive fortifications. On the morning of July 26, the authorities sent Deng Yancun, Deputy Director of the Ordnance Factory, Zeng Qiang, Director of the General Headquarters Adjutant Office, Wei Qianzhi, Special Adjutant, and three senior German military advisors to Shaozhou by special train of the Guangshao Railway to survey and plan everything. After the matter was completed, they returned to the province by the original train, and went to Tangxia in the northern suburbs to survey new-style trenches. It is also heard that the authorities recently established a large-scale ammunition manufacturing facility in a certain place in Beijiang, and the German advisors went to arrange the engineering matters on the same day.

<h3>Severe Flood Disaster in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Mountain Torrents Erupt, Dike Defenses Collapse in Many Places</p>
<p>Guangdong Provincial Government Allocates Relief Funds to Guizhou for Distribution</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Guizhou has suffered from military disasters in the past. Recently, it has been hit by floods again. The Provincial Government has established a disaster relief committee to handle the distribution of relief. The recent disaster in Guizhou was due to incessant rain since the beginning of summer. For months, mountain torrents erupted, and the situation was particularly severe in Zunyi, Tongzi, Meitan, Fengquan in northern Guizhou, and Songtao, Jiangkou, Sinan, Shengxi, Yanhe, Yinjiang, and Wuchuan in eastern Guizhou. Fields and livestock were washed away, and refugees were displaced. It was an unprecedented catastrophe. Yesterday, Wang Jialie of Guizhou Province telegraphed Wang Jiezhi, director of the 25th Army's Resident Guangdong Office, and Zhang Yunliang, the resident Guangdong representative, asking them to seek relief from the Guangdong Provincial Government and charitable organizations here. Wang and Zhang have been contacting the Provincial Government and Hong Kong organizations separately. The Guangdong Provincial Government has ordered its departments to raise funds to send relief. The order stated, "Now approved, the Guizhou Provincial Government Chairman Wang's telegraph states, 'Unfortunately, Guizhou is plagued by disasters. Last autumn, the harvest was poor, and there were locusts. This summer, mountain torrents erupted, and the people suffered. Previously, Xingyi and other counties in the west were hit by rain and hail, and now Tongzi, Tongren, Meitan, Fengquan in the north, and Tongren, Songtao, Jiangkou, Wuchuan, and other counties in the east are suffering from severe floods, which is unbearable to hear. The dikes have collapsed, leaving only two or three intact. Eight or nine out of ten of the foundations of cultivation and sericulture have been destroyed. Our people are displaced and have nowhere to return. The wind and rain block the mountains, and the roads are rugged. Cattle, sheep, sons, and daughters have been sold. Firewood is expensive, and rice is like pearls. They are like emaciated doves and swans. Therefore, we urgently ask for help and appeal for mercy, hoping that benevolent people will show compassion and grant assistance, so that the dragon patterns will be used to benefit the dry and practice the merits of law, save 20,000 families, and combine the diligent offerings of the common people, revive flesh and bone, and be engraved forever. We hereby telegraph, hoping for your kind consideration,' etc. The government, after investigating the case, previously received Instruction No. 1477 from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, stating that the Guizhou Provincial Relief Association requested the allocation of funds for urgent relief for the major disaster in Guizhou Province, and the government was ordered to consider raising assistance, etc., and the relevant departments were ordered to jointly draft a plan for review. Now, based on the previous order, in addition to separate orders, the relevant departments are ordered to jointly draft a reply for review." It is heard that the Guangdong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance will allocate the existing relief funds in Guangdong to Guizhou to fulfill the responsibility of disaster relief and neighborhood assistance.

<h3>Another Reaction to New Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Tobacco and Alcohol Industries in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou telegraphed the Minister of Finance in Nanjing, the Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, and the Director of the Hubei Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, stating, "Our association received a telegraph on the 3rd of this month from the Wuxue City Chamber of Commerce in Hubei, which stated that the chairmen of the tobacco and alcohol industries in the city, Zhu Chengnong, Xu Zhuqing, and Li Yanhe, submitted a petition stating that the tax rate and market conditions were insufficient and requesting separate review to alleviate the difficulties of the people of Suzhou. Taxes on tobacco and alcohol have always been collected through public sales. Now, the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance abolished the public sales tax law in the 22nd year and formulated a new system with harsh clauses and severe penalties. The merchants of the tobacco and alcohol industries in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou have jointly petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating that the implementation of this new system would be tantamount to destroying commercial operations, and they have been allowed to consider the matter. The Tax Affairs Department also replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, informing the merchants of the tobacco and alcohol industries that if there were indeed difficulties, it could be discussed at length to ensure that both tax revenue and market conditions could be taken into account, indicating that there was still room for deliberation and flexibility in this new system. However, the newly appointed Guangji Tobacco and Alcohol Bureaus have repeatedly issued notices, ordering tobacco and alcohol merchants to implement the new regulations and to report and pay supplementary taxes on goods that had already been taxed under the previous regulations, under penalty of punishment. The important circumstances of the difficulties in the notice and market conditions are described below. The notice requires soil tobacco stores to report the existing tobacco leaves, tobacco shreds, and tobacco stems separately, under penalty of investigation, but verbally instructs them to pay supplementary taxes according to the new regulations. The taxes that have already been paid will be submitted to the provincial bureau for reconsideration. As far as the tobacco industry is concerned, it is only acting as an agent for buying and selling. For example, if it purchases tobacco leaves for domestic stores, it must first report and pay taxes before the leaves can leave the store. If the leaves have already entered the store, they must have already been taxed. As for tobacco leaves for export, the goods cannot be released without paying national taxes and issuing tax tickets. There is no possibility of tax evasion, and there is no need to pay supplementary taxes. As far as tax rates and commodity prices are concerned, the best tobacco leaves produced in other provinces are purchased by foreign merchants at higher prices, while the highest price of Guangji tobacco leaves is only about ten yuan, and some are only worth one or two yuan, which can only be used to manufacture soil tobacco. If a tax of four yuan, one dime, and five cents is levied per hundred catties according to the market scale, the tax rate already exceeds the commodity price. As for the tobacco leaves stored by farmers, they are all seeking buyers and selling them. Since they do not go inside or outside, there is no buying and selling behavior. Even if one store has difficulty selling, it will transfer it to another store for consignment. There is no need to report, and it is even impossible to report. Furthermore, as far as the tobacco leaves stored in the tobacco shred stores are concerned, taxes have already been paid when they enter the store, as mentioned above, and planing tax and business license fees have also been paid. The original tax regulations have been borne by the tobacco store merchants. However, as far as tobacco stems are concerned, the leaves are attached to the stems, and taxes are naturally paid when they enter the store. Furthermore, tobacco stems can only be used as firewood. What is the need to report? Moreover, Article 7 of the Regulations for the Collection of Special Taxes on Soil Tobacco stipulates that soil tobacco that has paid special taxes and has been planed into tobacco shreds for people to smoke is temporarily exempt from tobacco shred tax. However, the sub-bureau's notice requires the separate reporting of the planed tobacco shreds and tobacco stems. What is the purpose of this harsh tax? Furthermore, as far as the notice from the Guangji Soil Alcohol Inspection Sub-bureau is concerned, during this period of suspension of brewing, the existing alcohol must be sold out within a limited time, and another certificate must be filled out and taxes paid according to the new regulations before it can be released. It is not known that this rice wine has already been taxed when it was brewed and tax tickets have been obtained. How can it be taxed again? Alcohol is a stored commodity. If it cannot be sold out within the limited time, it will be punished. Is this not too unjust? Furthermore, the same government and the same tax revenue mean that the alcohol that has already been taxed cannot be sold as usual, and the tax that has already been paid cannot be considered valid. Not only do merchants not know what to do, but it also concerns the future prestige of tax policy. The new regulations stipulate that if temporary brewing is required, a report should be submitted to the provincial bureau to seal the stove. The stove door has already been destroyed during the suspension of brewing, and personnel can be dispatched for inspection. Furthermore, the water bandits have recently caused disasters, and business is extremely depressed. Merchants are suffering unbearably. If the existing alcohol is not released, it will mean the death of alcohol merchants. Our association, based on the petitions of tobacco and alcohol merchants in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou, requested that the prosperous areas of tobacco and alcohol in Wuhan be taken as a precedent and that the new tax be levied slowly before the new regulations are finalized, and then implemented after it has been clarified. Not only was it not approved, but the instructions even stated that they were lightly listening to the instigation of treacherous merchants, which caused inconvenience and had the force of compulsory implementation. The case concerns tax policy and market conditions, and there are obstacles in both. Tobacco and alcohol raw materials are produced in rural areas. If the tax law is so harsh, it will directly affect the commercial market and indirectly affect the residents, which is not a small matter. Our association is closely related and dares not remain silent. It is reasonable to submit this document to your association, hoping that you will review it and quickly telegraph the high-ranking officials to provide relief and transfer it to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Federation, and the Tobacco and Alcohol Federation to alleviate commercial difficulties and the suffering of the people of Suzhou, which is for the public good." According to this, the government has formulated a new system for tobacco and alcohol to unify tax rates, and the difficulties expressed by the merchants are also true. In addition to submitting them separately, we hereby telegraph your association to investigate and approve the transfer to the Nanjing and Hubei financial and administrative agencies, and urge them to provide relief to ensure that tax affairs and market conditions are planned and taken care of, which will be greatly appreciated. Since the Tax Affairs Department issued this rule, our association has repeatedly received requests from all members to amend the obstructive clauses and stringent procedures, and we have submitted special telegrams to request amendments. We hereby telegram the above reasons. In addition to telegraphing the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Hubei Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, we hereby transfer the telegram with a special statement of the facts, hoping that you will consider and provide relief, and approve the amendment of the said regulations, so that tax revenue and market conditions can be taken care of, and disputes will not escalate. Zhang Dalian, Chairman of the Joint Association of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Alcohol Industries, Standing Committee Members Dai Zhuoan, Jin Jiayue, Jin Yunjie, Chen Weiwen, Chen Liangyu, Chairman of the Joint Association of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Tobacco Industries, Standing Committee Members Zhang Suhou, Yu Xunlu, Shen Weiting, Cao Gexian, respectfully bow and sign.</p>
<h3>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Quarrel and Hang Themselves in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Wang Asong, a resident of Lujia Stone Bridge in the South Gate of the city, married Qian Yinzhen in the past. She was quite virtuous, but her sister-in-law, Jiang, was naturally shrewish. Quarrels often arose between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Qian Yinzhen found it difficult to compete and only swallowed her tears and complained to her husband. Asong also advised her to be patient in the hope of avoiding family breakdown. However, last night, another incident led to an argument with Jiang. Jiang actually resorted to violence. Qian Yinzhen, stimulated by this, was so distraught that she secretly hanged herself in the room at about 10 a.m. today. When the family members discovered it, it was too late to save her. Wang Asong reported to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred the case to Prosecutor Zhu Zonghai of the Procuratorate to go for an inspection. It was confirmed that she had hanged herself before death. A white homespun trousers belt was also found, which was used to hang herself. However, her husband, Wang Asong, said that she was beaten to death by Jiang and requested an investigation. After the inspection, Prosecutor Zhu ordered the police to bring Jiang back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Swedish Prince Visits Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government of Jiangsu approved a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that Prince Er of Sweden was traveling to Japan via the United States and visiting scenic spots in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Beijing. He was also investigating economic and commercial affairs in a private capacity. He was expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 15th of this month and then travel to Suzhou.

<h3>Robbery on Machine-Powered Boat</h3>
<p>The Yuanyuan Company's machine-powered boat, which travels between Suzhou and Jinshu Township, left the township for Suzhou at 7 a.m. yesterday (4th). When passing through the Shiliting area, there were actually passengers wearing a white gown and short clothes who took out handguns to frighten people and ordered them to be silent. They searched the passengers and robbed them of more than 500 yuan in foreign currency and jewelry. A man named Liu from the Zhengtianchang Fish Company in Shantang Street came to Suzhou from the township with more than 400 yuan in accounts, which were all robbed. After the bandits obtained the stolen goods, they went ashore and left.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Falls in Love with Famous Prostitute and Embezzles Money to Flee</h3>
<p>Su Yunshan, a resident of No. 81 Hongqiao in the city, is over forty years old. His wife, Hua, is about the same age. They have three daughters. The eldest is named Jindi, the second is Yuzhen, and the third is Baozhen. Yuzhen is twenty-nine years old. Su Yunshan took Jindi and Yuzhen to Shanghai to work as prostitutes. Soon, Yuzhen's name became well-known, and her fame spread. Then, she set up shop in Qingdao. At that time, Li Lisheng (also known as Lü Disheng), a partner of the Yutai Bean Shop in the South City of Shanghai, happened to be carrying money to Qingdao to purchase goods. In his free time, he visited the brothels and met Yuzhen, whom he was amazed by as if she were a celestial being. Therefore, he became infatuated with her all day long and spent a fortune in the hope of winning her heart. Yuzhen also considered him a patron, and both sides were in love. They got married at the Yingzhou Hotel in Qingdao. However, Li Lisheng spent too much money, accumulated a lot of debt, and could not make up for it. Therefore, he first ordered Yuzhen and her mother to return to Wuxi, and then fled to Beiping with more than 11,000 yuan of goods. When the owner of Yutai Shop found out, he immediately sent someone to Qingdao to investigate. He found Li's telegram to Wuxi at the telegraph office and remitted a thousand yuan to Yuzhen. So, he came to Wuxi and reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to arrest Su Yuzhen at the address and bring her to the bureau. After interrogating her in court, Section Chief Wu ordered her to be temporarily detained and ordered detectives Wang Shuanglin and others to take a document to Beiping overnight to arrest Li Lisheng and bring him back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>County Government Strictly Arrests Dung-Throwing Gang</h3>
<p>In the recent month in Xiyi, the power of the dung-throwing gang has been prevalent. The so-called dung-throwing gang is a group of hooligans who fill lead buckets or melon rinds with filth. They hold grudges or extort unsuccessfully. They wait on the side of the road. When the person passes by, they throw it, and the filth splashes everywhere, using it as a means of venting their anger and intimidation. In the most recent half month, the most prominent victims, such as lawyer Xu and reporter Zhou of a certain newspaper, have been subjected to this insult. Because there is no known leader, there is nothing they can do. In addition, a certain bureau chief and a certain celebrity have also received similar threatening letters and reported them to the county government and the Public Security Bureau for investigation. A few days ago, Mr. Tang, manager of a certain new dyeing and weaving company, was thrown filth at the entrance of Taiping Alley while riding home in his car after 7 p.m. The next day, he received an anonymous letter stating that this was just a small test to serve as a warning and that he should be careful in the future. Tang presented the letter to the county government and the Public Security Bureau, requesting legal action. County Chief Yan also believed that these people were disrupting public order and ordered the Public Security Bureau to order all the police to investigate strictly. Unexpectedly, the other night, at around 7 p.m., Lu Ke, a current member of the County Party Department Supervision Committee and lawyer, was also insulted at the foot of the North City Wall. Fortunately, Lu was quick-witted and ordered the driver to chase after them quickly. He was caught and identified as Wang Qinru, whose original surname was Tang. He was the son of Tang Laosan of the Juxing Tea House outside the West Gate. He was adopted by his aunt and changed his surname to Wang. He used to work at the Shenxin No. 1 Factory and is now unemployed at home. The rest of his words were ambiguous. He has now been transferred to the General Bureau by the bureau for interrogation. The County Public Security Bureau also arrested Li Jie yesterday, who is also related to this case.</p>

<h3>Nanhui Salt Field Survey to be Conducted by the Salt Works Themselves</h3>
<p>Although the case of surveying the stove tax and fees in this county has been called for by the stove operators and approved by the Provincial Land Bureau to be postponed, the county government has requested the Xiasha Tax Collection Office to collect the survey fees because the county land bureau is currently preparing and there is a proposal to collect the fees. The office requested instructions from the Songjiang Transportation Office, and the office received instructions from the Transportation Office yesterday, which forwarded instructions from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the stove land in each salt field is currently being actively cleaned up. The Songjiang area and Huainan belong to the Jiangsu area. The stove land in each field in Huainan has been assigned to the Huainan Transportation Office for registration and survey, which is not within the scope of the Jiangsu Land Bureau. The area is the same, and the Transportation Office should supervise each field to collect fees for the implementation, and to find out how much has been collected for the survey fees, and to estimate how much is still insufficient. They should also properly draft specific methods and procedures, prepare a detailed budget, and submit it for approval. The office has recorded the order and forwarded it to the county government for reference.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin First Land Value Tax Collection Begins</h3>
<p>Since the 21st year, the Department of Finance issued an order to abolish the grain and rice taxation and replace it with land value tax. The former Department of Finance did not implement the reform and only combined the upper and lower taxes and renamed it the first land value tax. The winter tax was renamed the second land value tax. Since the county government took over the Department of Finance, it has followed the provincial order and combined the grain and rice taxation and collected it in a four-six split. The first four-tenths was collected from the first day. The provincial tax should be one dime, six cents, two li, and eight hao per mu, the county surtax should be three cents and four li and eight hao, the collection fee should be eight li and four si, and the water conservancy fee should be three li, one hao, and six si per mu. In addition, the education, autonomy, road construction, local agricultural improvement, offsetting local accumulated losses, grain storage fund, household registration, and local education fees should be one dime and six cents and eight li per mu. In addition, a survey fee of one dime per mu was ordered to be collected, totaling five dimes, three cents, and eight hao per mu.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Wan Zihan Embezzlement Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Wan Zihan, an employee of the Nanjing Bank of Communications, was sending 26,000 yuan in cash to the Central Bank when he suddenly became unruly and tried to embezzle the money and abscond. He designed to get rid of the bank's official car and hired an Anle Restaurant car to come to Suzhou, intending to go elsewhere. Because he had been traveling for a long time, the bank found out and telegraphed Zhenjiang. The Zhenjiang branch sent personnel to cooperate with the Public Security Bureau to intercept Wan in Paiwan. They checked the money and found that only 100 yuan had been spent, and 25,900 yuan in cash was confiscated. They took him to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The money was received by the Zhenjiang branch and transferred to the Beijing branch. Wan Zihan was transferred to the court for investigation and prosecution. The Procuratorate concluded its investigation yesterday and transferred him to the criminal court for public judgment on charges of embezzlement. At about 10 a.m. yesterday, Ouyang, the presiding judge of the criminal court, came to the court and questioned Wan Zihan. He confessed without denial. He was immediately declared terminated and sentenced. The main text of the judgment was that Wan Zihan was sentenced to three years and eight months of imprisonment for embezzling items held in his business.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Wang Jinzhuang Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>More than 300 bandits based in Xiajiaji in the tenth district of the county, formerly troops under Chen's department Sun's camp, went to You to suppress them. The bandits immediately fled to Dongzhongtan Xiaogezhuang in the ninth district. Unexpectedly, Sun's camp suddenly received an order to transfer to Huai the next day, so they could not track and suppress them. Now the bandits are still looting in the ninth district. Wang Jinzhuang in the district was suddenly attacked by more than 20 bandits at about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. They searched every household and looted everything. They also tied up timber merchant Xu Guilin and told his family to prepare 2,000 yuan for ransom.</p>
<h3>Gaobei Outside the Gate Injured in Roadside Robbery</h3>
<p>About half a li north of the fort outside the North Gate of this county, there is a boatman named Feng Gengru. Yesterday (29th) at about 5 a.m., he was carrying a package because of something. He was walking from south to north when he suddenly encountered two people wearing white short shirts and trousers with a Dongtai accent who shouted at him to stop and search him. They robbed Feng of 11 yuan in cash and several jiao in small change in the package. Feng was reluctant and followed them. The bandits were angry, turned around and stabbed Feng in the abdomen with a knife, and blood flowed like a column. Feng immediately fell to the ground unconscious.

<h3>Hangzhou Lawyer Tian Jiaxiang Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Tian Jiaxiang, a lawyer from Hangzhou, 38 years old, had served as a judge in various places. Last year, he worked in the judicial circles in Beijing. He returned to Hangzhou with his family last month to practice law, setting up his office at No. 2 Shou'anfang, while his family resided at No. 11 Jiuliesong, West Lake. Tian had two wives. The first wife was the wife of Tong Hangshi, the president of the Supreme Court. He remarried a woman from a certain family in Jiuliesong, this city, as his second wife. They had been married for over thirteen years and had seven children. Yesterday, he suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. At around 7 o'clock, he took ten sleeping pills, locked the door from the inside, and went to sleep. An hour later, his wife became suspicious, fearing something might happen. She went upstairs to check and found him lying stiff on the bed, breathing rapidly. She quickly ordered a car and rushed him to the West Lake Hospital near Broken Bridge for treatment. After President Yang Yusheng gave him a life-saving injection and flushed his stomach with medicine, he vomited. By 9 o'clock, he had urinated twice. According to the hospital nurse, his life was out of danger.</p>
<h3>Entire Militia Team of Pinghu County Resigns</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the militia team of Pinghu County has solved major cases and captured vicious bandits, relying on the local area. Now, some shareholders are opposing the land tax, causing widespread hesitation. This tax is the only source of income for the team. Since Jin Jiansun and other shareholders opposed it, they have not received a penny for four months. The team's food expenses have been maintained by the team leader, Gan Kaijun, through borrowing from various sources. Now, due to prolonged hunger and fatigue, the leaders of the first, second, and third platoons, as well as the squad leaders of each squad, have successively requested to resign. Gan also has no way to borrow and cannot maintain the team. Yesterday, he pleaded to resign to the general headquarters. After submitting his resignation, he went to Shanghai to recuperate. The team's affairs are temporarily managed by the deputy team leader, Fan Liming. In addition to submitting a request to Yu Jishi, the captain of the provincial security team, Fan also prepared resignation letters for his subordinates and officials, resigning from their positions together. From now on, the defense of Pinghu County will rely solely on the water and land public security bureaus. The local people are very worried about this.</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Winter Telegram Accepts the Principles of Wang Jingwei and Jiang Jieshi's Telegrams</h3>
<p>Specific Measures Still Need to be Negotiated</p>
<p>Li Liejun Has Gone to the North to Mediate</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, after receiving the telegram from Wang Jingwei and Jiang Jieshi, Feng Yuxiang replied with a public telegram, expressing his concern for the situation in Chahar. The night before last, another winter telegram arrived in Shanghai. In order to uphold the commitment to resist Japan and avoid civil war, he expressed complete acceptance of the four principles proposed in the telegram from Wang Jingwei and Jiang Jieshi. The telegram was over 800 words long and full of generous and tragic language. It has been separately sent to Wang Jingwei and Jiang Jieshi in Nanjing, Beijing, and Wan by Central Committee member Li Xiehe. The full text will be published after their reply. Yesterday, Li told a reporter from the Far East News Agency that the Chahar situation is rapidly improving towards peace. Specific measures still need to be negotiated. If necessary, he will go to the North himself to mediate.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Still Staying in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Rumored to Fly to Jiangxi to Visit Jiang Jieshi Within Days</p>
<p>Jiang Jieshi's private Sikorsky airplane flew from Jiangxi to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It was rumored that it was to pick up Kong Xiangxi, the president of the Central Bank, to Jiangxi to discuss important matters. However, Kong was still at the Central Bank yesterday.

<h3>Deng Wen's Murder Confirmed</h3>
<p>Telegram from General Ma's Representative in Peiping</p>
<p>Lang Guanpu Speaks on This Case</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the news of General Deng Wen's murder reached Shanghai, the reason for it has not yet been clarified. However, it is known that the murder is indeed a fact.</p>
<p>(Reply Telegram from Duan Zhongfan) Lang Guanpu, the former acting chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, immediately sent urgent telegrams to Peiping and Zhangjiakou to inquire about the truth after receiving the bad news of Deng's murder. He also sent a telegram to Moganshan to report to General Ma Zhanshan. Lang received a reply telegram from Duan Zhongfan, General Ma's representative in Peiping, yesterday morning, reporting that General Deng Wen was suddenly assassinated at his residence in Zhangjiakou at dawn on the 31st of last month. The murderer escaped from the scene, and the truth is still unclear. The bad news of Deng's murder has now been confirmed. (Lang Guanpu's Speech) A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Lang Guanpu yesterday morning to ask for his opinion on Deng's murder. According to Lang, Deng made significant contributions to the anti-Japanese war in Heilongjiang Province. Last winter, he was transferred to Rehe for reorganization and replenishment. After being reorganized by the Central Government, he was stationed near Duolun. Now, the bad news has come that Deng has been confirmed to be murdered. He is deeply saddened and indignant. As for who instigated Deng's assassination, the truth is still unclear. However, Zhangjiakou is within Feng Yuxiang's sphere of influence. At this time of tense situation in Chahar Province, the security of Zhangjiakou should be extremely tight. How could the thugs enter the house and assassinate a high-ranking military leader, and then allow the murderer to escape safely without a trace? Feng Yuxiang should bear full responsibility for this and cannot shirk it. So far, Chahar Province has not sent any telegrams to report on this matter. The rumor that Chief of Staff Rong Yusu sent a telegram to Shanghai to report is not true.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Area Can Avoid Floods This Year</h3>
<p>Zhu Yong, the chief of the Engineering Section of the National Economic Committee, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that the water level of the Yangtze River has been receding day by day. The water level in Hankou has dropped to 41 feet 2 inches, which is three inches lower than the day before. The water level in Yichang and Shashi is also decreasing day by day. According to the current situation, floods can be avoided this year. There has been no rain in the Hankou area in recent days. Although there are still two weeks before the flood season according to previous years, the fact that the water level is decreasing before the flood season proves that floods will definitely not occur this year.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Hundred Thousand Dollars of New Coins Cast Daily</h3>
<p>The Review Committee Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss Factory Strip Style</p>
<p>Old Coins Are Being Recycled, Melted, and Recast Into New Coins</p>
<p>After being inspected and approved by the Review Committee, the new coins of the Central Mint have been circulating in the market since the 5th of last month. The total amount is 5.77 million yuan. In order to increase production and regulate finance, the mint is working day and night to cast 150,000 yuan per day and is recycling old coins for melting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Casting Day and Night) The new coins of the Central Mint, which have been inspected and approved by the Review Committee, were issued on July 1.</p>
<p>3.155 million yuan were issued on July 1. From July 5 to July 31, 2.665 million yuan were issued after being inspected and approved. The total is 5.77 million yuan. In order to increase production, the mint is working day and night, casting about 150,000 yuan of new coins every day. All are inspected by the Review Committee according to regulations and sent to the Central Bank for circulation in the market.</p>
<p>(Factory Strip Style) Since the abolition of silver taels and silver ingots, silver coins have been used for silver coin transactions in various industries. Silver taels from various places are concentrated in Shanghai. The Qianye Guild has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to order the Central Mint to increase the amount of casting as soon as possible to facilitate circulation and avoid affecting finance. It is said that the Central Mint has decided to issue factory strips, each worth 1,000 yuan, to regulate finance and facilitate the exchange of cash in various industries. As for the factory strip style, it has already been cast. The Review Committee will submit it for discussion at a general meeting held at the Central Bank at 4:00 pm on the 11th of this month to start casting.</p>
<p>(Melting Old Coins) After the new coins are issued, the Central Mint will, in accordance with the provisions of the Coinage Regulations,</p>
<p>recycle old coins, melt them down, and recast them into new coins. Anyone who holds old coins that meet the original fixed quality and weight can exchange them for new coins at the Central Bank. The Central Bank has now packed the old coins it has collected and transported them to the Central Mint for melting. It is said that the silver furnace industry has been unable to operate since the abolition of taels and has closed down one after another.</p>
<h3>American Cotton on the Way to China</h3>
<p>A Total of 148,800 Bales in August</p>
<p>Sold by Fook Yuen, American-Anli Trading Co.</p>
<p>First Batch Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai After the 20th of This Month</p>
<p>Chinese Textile Factories and Flower Firms Are Watching</p>
<p>Purchasing and Transportation to China According to the National News Agency, this purchase of American cotton is from New Orleans and New York, the center of the cotton industry in the southern United States. The transportation method to China is not based on batches, but on monthly calculations, such as how much will be transported to China in August, how much in September. The cotton for August, the earliest shipment, should arrive in Shanghai after about the 20th of this month. Other shipments loaded in early August will arrive in China in September. However, all batches of goods are designated to be delivered in Shanghai. At the same time, after the cotton arrives in Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government designates the Fook Yuen Co. at No. 4 Edward Road, the American-Anli Trading Co. at Sassoon Building, and the Anli Co. at No. 4 Edward Road to sell the cotton. Therefore, any Chinese textile factory can order from the three trading companies that sell the cotton.</p>
<p>August Shipments Currently, the American cotton shipped to China in August, including those that are already on the way and those that will be shipped, totals more than 148,000 bales. According to the price reports, although the quality of the cotton varies, the highest price is 62.10 yuan and the lowest is 57.20 yuan. Although the cotton is scheduled to be shipped to China in mid-August, the market price has been sold based on October calculations. The number of bales and the types of goods shipped to China are listed below:</p>
<p>Number of Cotton Bales (500 pounds per bale) Fiber Length Price (Yuan)</p>
<p>10,000 bales 7/8 inch 59.75</p>
<p>3,000 bales 7/8 inch 58.5510,000 bales 29/32 inch 59.9510,000 bales 15/16 inch 60.653,000 bales 7/8 inch 59.208,500 bales 29/32 inch 59.758,500 bales 15/16 inch 60.4010,000 bales 7/8 inch 61.152,600 bales 7/8 inch 60.45</p>
<p>10,000 bales 29/32 inch 61.4010,000 bales 15/16 inch 61.852,000 bales 7/8 inch 60.908,500 bales 29/32 inch 61.156,000 bales 15/16 inch 61.602,000 bales 31/32 inch 62.105,800 bales 7/8 inch 60.001,400 bales 29/32 inch 60.202,000 bales 31/32 inch 60.901,000 bales 29/32 inch 59.15500 bales 7/8 inch 57.6510,000 bales 29/32 inch 57.9010,000 bales 15/16 inch 58.15500 bales 7/8 inch 57.651,000 bales 29/32 inch 57.904,500 bales 15/16 inch 58.152,000 bales 31/32 inch 58.85500 bales 29/32 inch 57.205,000 bales 15/16 inch 57.45500 bales 31/32 inch 58.15</p>
<p>Chinese Factories Watching Although China borrows cotton and wheat from the United States to sell, it is actually no different from cash. Because China's cotton production cannot meet its own needs, and Chinese textile factories need cotton, they are happy to accept this assistance. Now that American cotton has begun to be transported to China, most textile merchants are still watching because there are still problems with the price and distribution.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Order While Chinese textile factories and flower firms are watching, Fook Yuen Trading Co., one of the distributors, has actually sold to foreign merchants. After investigation by reporters, it has been confirmed that about 10,000 bales have been sold. The textile factory that purchased the cotton is Dongmian, 7/8 inch cotton 3,000 bales, 15/16 inch cotton 1,000 bales, and the rest is Rixin Jiangshang. American-Anli Trading Co. also sold some cotton, but the quantity is unknown. Only Anli has not been purchased by anyone.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warship "Futami" Towed to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Entering Dock for Major Repairs Today</p>
<p>The shallow-water warship "Futami" of the First Overseas Dispatch Fleet of the Japanese Navy ran aground on a reef about 25 li upstream of Wushan, Yichang, on June 25 while carrying Commander Minai to Chongqing. The bottom of the ship was caught in the reef, creating a large hole, and the ship sank, suffering severe damage. The important gun positions and munitions on the ship were dismantled by the Kure and Ise warships dispatched by the Japanese Naval Headquarters in Hankou and transported to Hankou for storage. However, the hull of the ship was firmly stuck on the reef and did not sink completely, but all the cabins were flooded, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<p>Salvage Operations After the Futami's accident, Captain Komuki Hyakubu immediately led the stationed soldiers to stay on the</p>
<p>ship and carry out salvage work. Banno, the commander of the Japanese Navy in Hankou, also dispatched a batch of technicians and workers to Wushan to assist in the rescue. Starting on June 26, they began to destroy the reefs in the river that were blocking the ship. After 13 days, they finally managed to tow the Futami hull away from the reef. According to Komuki, all the officers, soldiers, and technicians worked day and night during these 13 days of rescue work. They managed to move the ship away from the reef in the midst of little hope, which was truly fortunate.</p>
<p>Repairing and Departing After the ship was removed from the reef, the second step was to repair the hole in the bottom of the ship caused by the grounding, which was extremely difficult. At that time, the water level of the upper reaches of the river was rising sharply, reaching over 70 feet. The divers who entered the water to repair the hole encountered various dangers. After half a month, they finally temporarily sealed the hole. The sealing was repeatedly repaired and cracked several times. Then, the accumulated water was pumped out, and the entire ship was able to float on the surface of the river on July 25. However, many workers were exhausted as a result.</p>
<p>Towed to Shanghai for Major Repairs After the Futami was salvaged, the Japanese Naval Headquarters consulted with the Nisshin Shipping Company,</p>
<p>and dispatched the Yangtze River ship Yiyang Maru to Wushan Gorge to tow the Futami to Shanghai for major repairs. When the Yiyang Maru towed the ship through Tongzhou, it encountered the recent hurricane. Fortunately, the Yiyang Maru and Futami quickly dropped anchor when passing through the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, but they were still severely impacted by the storm. Yesterday, the Futami was towed to Shanghai by the Yiyang Maru and temporarily anchored in the Yangshupu River. It will enter the shipyard for reconstruction today. After leaving the shipyard, the unloaded ordnance and guns will be transported to Shanghai for reassembly. Captain Komuki also came to Shanghai to supervise the repairs. The grounding and salvage of the Futami will cost more than ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at China General Edison Company</h3>
<p>The Company Obstructs Employees' Sick Leave and Dismisses Them on Pretext</p>
<p>All Employees Petitioned the City Party Headquarters Yesterday</p>
<p>The staff of the China General Edison Company as a whole have shown their general opposition towards the recent firing of Zhou Yongfang, an employee of the technology department. Zhou Yongfang applied for sick leave to the manager on July 3rd. The leave slip was personally approved by manager Lu Bohong, but on July 29th, Lu dismissed Zhou from his position on the pretext that the leave had been for too many days. Zhu Fengyan, an employee of the lighting department of the company, and Shen Wenluo, an employee of the engineering department, both applied for sick leave due to infectious diseases. Lu deliberately made things difficult and did not approve their leave, which resulted in a drastic change in Zhu Fengyan's condition and nearly led to an accident. Upon hearing the news, all the employees were outraged and unanimously expressed their intention to gather together and demand two things from Lu Bohong: (1) Reinstate Zhou Yongfang to his position; (2) In the future, the dismissal of employees should be handled in accordance with the (Standards for Dismissal of Store Employees) stipulated by the Central Training Department, and sick leave for employees should not be obstructed. However, Lu did not come to the company the day before yesterday and yesterday, avoiding meeting them. As a result, the situation became serious. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, over 200 employees gathered and marched to the City Party Headquarters to petition. Members Tong Hangbai and Lu Jingshi personally received them and promised to immediately stop the company's actions.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>The workers' children's school run by the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union of Shanghai receives a monthly subsidy of 750 yuan from the factory to cover its operating expenses. However, last month, the factory suddenly broke the agreement and planned to take back the workers' children's school to run it themselves. Several attempts to mediate by party and government agencies have been unsuccessful. The labor side also submitted amendments to the management rules and requested that the factory's violation of the agreement and destruction of education be investigated, and requested that a fair judgment be made to protect labor and education. It has been found that the voluntary schools run by the British American Tobacco Company before 1927 were largely non-compliant. After the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the factory immediately closed the schools. At that time, the directors of the union could not bear to see thousands of workers' children lose their education, so they raised donations and managed the schools with great difficulty. The financial sacrifices made by the directors are still on record. Later, unfortunately, a labor-capital dispute occurred. When the dispute was resolved, an agreement was signed, stipulating in Article 3 that a voluntary school for workers' children would be established, and all the details were specified in the annex jointly determined by both parties on April 1, 1929, to be jointly observed. The school's administration has followed the rules and regulations, so the educational affairs have been progressing day by day, and the number of students at all levels has reached more than 700. The factory's monthly subsidy of only 750 yuan is insufficient, and the union has been working hard to maintain the school. It was hoped that the labor and capital sides would work together to promote the development of education. However, on June 23, they suddenly received a letter from the factory, falsely accusing the school of being poorly managed and intending to cancel the school contract on June 30. After reviewing the letter, the union found that it was completely based on the factory's personal feelings and had no sufficient reason. They immediately refuted it based on reason and also submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting mediation. After several negotiations, they repeatedly tried to compromise, but the factory refused to budge and instead proposed harsh terms that went beyond the scope of the agreement, hoping to infringe on their sovereignty and destroy the original contract, resulting in no results. It is believed that the factory is ostensibly improving the school but is actually destroying it. The intentions of Sima Zhao are obvious to everyone. All the directors and supervisors of the union, for the sake of the welfare of thousands of workers' children, vowed to live and die with the school. As long as they have a breath left, this will will not change. The summer vacation is coming to an end, and the autumn semester is about to begin. All the procedures need to be carried out urgently. If the matter is delayed, it will have a significant impact on education. Therefore, they are submitting a report to the mayor, requesting that he be informed of the difficulties of the workers and order the factory to fulfill the original contract to avoid harming education. As for the factory's suggestions for improvement, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the agreement, the factory representatives can offer their opinions at any time and place. With urgent words, they await your instructions. Respectfully presented,</p>
<h3>General Ma Publishes Donation Figures, Mr. Lang Guanpu Expresses</h3>
<p>Hoping the Investigation Committee Clears Donation Accounts</p>
<p>And Investigates the 20 Million Yuan Rumor</p>
<p>A visit to Pan Xulun of the Central News Agency reported that after General Ma Zhanshan recently announced that the total amount of donations received from across the country was more than 1,713,800 yuan, accountant Pan Xulun, who is responsible for auditing the fundraising institutions in Shanghai for saving the country and supporting the army, issued his opinion for the sake of maintaining social credit. Mr. Lang Guanpu, the former acting chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, specifically visited Mr. Pan the other day, and offered some explanations regarding Mr. Pan's opinion. Mr. Lang stated that the first batch of consolation donations received by General Ma from all sectors of society totaled more than 1.3 million yuan, which had already been clearly reported in the credit report issued in Heilongjiang Province. However, because all documents and books were lost in Heilongjiang Province, the total amount announced could not include the names of the donors or the names of the donating institutions. However, it seemed that the Tianjin Dagong Bao had published this report at that time, and a letter had been sent to the newspaper to inquire, which might be obtained. Mr. Pan expressed his complete understanding of this, and for the sake of maintaining social credit, both parties hoped that the various committees organized by various groups in Shanghai to investigate national salvation donations would actively conduct investigations of the accounts of various donating institutions in order to show great trust. In particular, they hoped that the rumor that the total amount of donations to aid Ma had reached 20 million yuan would be thoroughly investigated, so that the truth of the matter could be revealed.</p>
<p>Speaking Out, Dagong News Agency Reported That General Ma Zhanshan had been fighting the Japanese in Heilongjiang Province for many years. The total amount of consolation donations received from all walks of life across the country was more than 1,713,000 yuan, which was entrusted to Mr. Lang Guanpu, Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Finance, to announce the amount received on August 1st, and to issue a notice detailing the receiving procedures and locations to show great trust. It is now known that after Mr. Lang announced the detailed amount of anti-Japanese donations, some people from all walks of life still did not understand the truth, and there were still doubts. Mr. Lang specifically gave a speech to the Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday, explaining the doubts of the outside world in great detail. The record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Explaining Two Points According to Mr. Lang, after the detailed amount of anti-Japanese donations received by Mr. Ma was announced, some people from all walks of life still did not understand the truth, which caused misunderstandings and doubts among many people. The main points of their doubts were nothing more than the following two items: (1) General Ma initially claimed that he had received more than 1.4 million yuan in donations. On August 1st, representatives of General Ma claimed in various newspapers that the amount received was more than 1.6 million yuan. However, the number officially announced on August 2nd increased to another 171,000 yuan. It seems that the total amount has not been completely determined, making it impossible for people to check. (2) According to Mr. Ma, detailed books and records have been left in Heilongjiang Province. The amount of foreign currency announced is based on a book kept by personnel in Harbin. However, it is highly suspected whether the number of receipts recorded in this book is correct and whether there are any omissions. It was found that Mr. Ma initially claimed that he had received more than 1.4 million yuan in donations, which referred to those directly received by Mr. Ma. The number of other indirect receipts was unknown to Mr. Ma and had not been settled, so it was difficult to know the details. After Mr. Ma conducted an investigation of the accounts, a total of 1,713,000 yuan was settled, including those received indirectly. Therefore, the total amount was more than 1,690,000 yuan. This was still the account before August 1st. Until the night before the announcement, a telegram was received from Beiping, stating that Wan Fulin, the former chairman of Heilongjiang Province, had collected a total of tens of thousands of yuan in donations for Mr. Ma on the front line. The total of the two was the number of 1,713,000 yuan announced. This was the situation when the accounts were checked, which was very common, and it was also the reason why the total amount of donations received increased. The outside world does not understand the truth, and misunderstandings may inevitably occur, but it is also a fact that the total amount received cannot be completely determined. Because the amount of funds omitted and not received must be not small, the number announced on August 1st cannot be regarded as an accurate number. Because the office received a telegram from the Nanjing Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying that more than 10,000 yuan of donations were collected on behalf of the office but had not been remitted. For this reason alone, the total amount of donations has increased again. Therefore, before the investigation is completed, it is difficult to determine the total amount. As for whether the amount of donations recorded in a book retained by Mr. Ma is accurate and reliable, this office is absolutely responsible for guaranteeing that there will be no errors or omissions.</p>
<p>Advocating Thorough Investigation It is now rumored that the total amount of donations to Mr. Ma is more than 20 million yuan, but I am very suspicious of where this statistic comes from. According to my speculation, the total amount of donations to Mr. Ma is more than 1.7 million yuan, but it will never be as much as 20 million yuan. If all the anti-Japanese donations from the four northeastern provinces are included together with the 19th Route Army donations, the number of 20 million yuan is still reliable. However, since there is such a rumor in the outside world, it should also be thoroughly investigated in order to maintain social credit and clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Cases such as labor-management mutual assistance conditions, unpaid wages for two days during the previous work reduction period, and the unjustified dismissal of three child laborers from Xinyie have not been arbitrated to this day. Recently, workers have been prevented from paying union dues. If negotiations are not conducted on the basis of reason and a solution is quickly sought, a storm will break out and it will be difficult to control the situation. Yesterday morning, Chen Peide, Liu Dehua, Lou Jingguan, Xiao Gengsheng, Zhang Ziping, Fei Keguang, Bao Yangzhou, Hu Xiaomei, Xie Peiji, Ren Zhenxiang, Ren Kunda, Dong Aosheng, Zhang Mufang, Zeng Rong, Hong Meiquan, Wang Ajin, Li Chunde, Zheng Liming, Zhu Shihao, Zhang Awu and other more than 20 directors and supervisors carried a petition to the Municipal Government. Hong Kui, the chief of the Second Section, received them. The union representatives handed over the petition and stated the process of the school run by the union in the past. They also said that before the 16th year of the Republic of China, the schools run by the factory did not comply with the regulations in many ways. There were only 300 students per month and the cost was 1,500 yuan. Now that the association is running the school, there are more than 700 students and the factory only subsidizes 750 yuan. Now they even want to cancel it, which is obviously for other purposes. They requested that the factory be negotiated with on the basis of reason to resolve the pending cases and submitted for arbitration together. Chief Hong replied, (1) According to the conditions, the school should be run by the sponsor; (2) The cases of two days' wages during the shutdown period, the amendment of management rules, labor-management conditions, and the dismissal of three child laborers by Xinyie will be transferred to Secretary-General Yu for a quick solution. The union representatives were satisfied and left. Attached is the union's petition to the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>After Huang Zhaohui Was Kidnapped, the Union Reported to the Party and Government, Requesting a Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Previously Extorted for Subsidies by Gangsters</p>
<p>Union Members Scattered and Stalled</p>
<p>After Huang Zhaohui, the standing director of the Fourth District Cotton Textile Industry Union, was kidnapped and disappeared, it aroused deep concern from all walks of life. The union yesterday petitioned the party and government for negotiations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reporting to the Party and Government Since Huang Zhaohui was kidnapped on the evening of the first day of this month on Yangshupu Road near the Ruirong Iron Factory, the Fourth District Cotton Textile Industry Union has formed an appeal association to prepare for negotiations. This morning, the situation was reported to the Municipal Party Committee Social Affairs Bureau General Federation of Trade Unions, requesting (1) a thorough investigation of the truth, (2) punishment of the murderers, and (3) efforts to rescue Huang.</p>
<p>Dangerous Encounter in Advance Huang Zhaohui is from Hunan, 28 years old, and lives in Xinkang Lane, Hongkou. He has a wife and a one-year-old son. He used to work at Shenxin No. 5 Factory. After being dismissed, he immediately prepared for the Fourth District Cotton Textile Union. At 9:00 p.m. last Friday (July 28), when he went to Qi's house to raise funds to pay for the union's expenses, he met two gangsters at the intersection of Huaru Road, Gaolang Bridge, who demanded union fees. Huang Zhaohui did not know them and ignored them, which led to him being stopped at the Xianglianyi Hotel and forced to pay. Huang Zhaohui then escaped from the back door of the hotel. The bandits negotiated with the hotel and the hotel owner reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which arrested the two gangsters and released them because the plaintiff did not arrive.</p>
<p>Union Stalls The preparatory committee of the Fourth District Cotton Textile Industry Union consists of Huang Zhaohui and other 15 people. Since the preparation, eight people have been dismissed by the factory on various pretexts. Since Huang Zhaohui was kidnapped, all the preparatory committee members have been extremely frightened, believing that there is no guarantee. They have all temporarily avoided being victimized. Therefore, the union lacks people in charge and has stalled in terms of organization. As for the party and government organs, after receiving the report on Huang Zhaohui's kidnapping, they have been secretly conducting a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Designating US Cotton Loan to Restore the Zhabei Disaster Area</h3>
<p>Proposed by Ye Jiaxing, Executive Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Ye Jiaxing, Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, according to the telegrams from President Wang and Chairman Chiang, designated the US cotton loan specifically for the needs of rural revitalization. Yesterday, he specifically proposed to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request the central government to designate a portion of the US loan to be used to restore the Zhabei disaster area. The original text is recorded as follows: The Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai, and the prosperous urban areas such as Zhabei, Wusong, and Jiangwan were reduced to rubble. Homeowners, farmers, and hundreds of industries suffered huge losses, and recovery is extremely difficult. It is proposed to request the central government to designate a portion of this US wheat loan to be used to rescue the war-torn area to help it recover. The reasons and methods are attached. If it is appropriate, please make a public decision. (Reasons) Since the establishment of the Municipal Government of this city, in order to realize the plan of Greater Shanghai, it first started to complete the central area. The areas of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei are connected to the central area, so municipal construction has made considerable progress. The population of each district is becoming increasingly dense, and hundreds of industries are becoming increasingly prosperous. Looking to the future, there is a momentum of great brilliance. Unfortunately, the dwarf invaders came and the war broke out. The essence of each district was destroyed by artillery fire. The desolation is full of eyes, and it is painful to speak of. After the end of the war, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association jointly handled the registration of losses in the war zone. The registered losses totaled more than 140 million yuan, and there are still unregistered ones, which must be more than this number. The deep pain is unprecedented in the history of this city. It was found that the four groups jointly investigated the losses in the war zone, originally intended to be a basis for future relief. However, years have passed and the talk of relief has gradually subsided, as if the matter has passed and the north has moved, and it is not worth mentioning the old things again. However, the people in the war zone today cannot return, and hundreds of industries have no strength to rise. Their difficult lives and embarrassing situation cannot be described in words. If they are not given considerable relief, the strong will become bandits and the weak will die in the ditches, which will be an inevitable fact. Considering that the central government has recently concluded a US wheat loan, I read earlier the joint telegrams from President Wang and Chairman Chiang, saying that this US wheat loan is to be used for rural revitalization, which shows that the authorities care about the people, which is very gratifying. Although the urban area of Shanghai is a big city, except for the three special districts of Hunan, Zhabei, and Shanghai, most of it is still in the form of rural areas. Those who rely on agriculture as their mainstay are more than just thousands. Moreover, this war directly destroyed agriculture, which is as profound as the destruction of industry, commerce, and municipal construction. Therefore, while revitalizing industry and commerce is an urgent task at present, the recovery of the prosperity of the rural areas of this city cannot be delayed. Moreover, there are two purposes for revitalizing rural areas: one is to improve the lives of farmers, and the other is to promote the increase of agricultural products. However, after the increase of agricultural products, it all depends on the city for sales. Otherwise, the surplus of agricultural products will only form a bloated pathological state. Therefore, in order to seek the smooth sale of agricultural products, it is first necessary to increase the purchasing power of cities. In other words, increasing the purchasing power of cities is indirectly revitalizing the rural economy. It is found that this city is the leading city in the country, and its purchasing power for agricultural products has always been known to be strong. However, since the war, the recession of society, the tension in form, and the decline of hundreds of industries have been dying. The crux of the matter is that the market in the areas of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei cannot be revitalized. Therefore, when the ruling authorities allocate the use of US wheat loans this time, in addition to the revitalization of the rural economy, they should also consider the relief of the war zone in this city, so that hundreds of industries can reach soundness from recovery, and reach prosperity from soundness. Then the city's strong purchasing power will inevitably increase in direct proportion, and its indirect contribution to the revitalization of rural areas is more than a little bit. As the saying goes, "One good deed brings many beauties," and I will observe it in this matter. If the stubbornness of foolishness is appropriate, I respectfully ask for a decision. (Methods) After the central government decides to allocate funds, the four groups that handled the damage registration last time will distribute them equally according to the total registration amount to show fairness.</p>
<h3>The Falling of the Yangtze River Makes Anqing Difficult to Navigate</h3>
<p>Most of the Crew Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Taigoo Company's Yangtze River liner Anqing was launched from Wuhan on the 25th of last month. When it reached the Qingshan Port area near Jiujiang, the river water upstream was very high. The Anqing wheel was close to the left bank to avoid a ship, and it was suddenly stranded at the lower corner of the Hualou Island in Qingshan Port. At that time, the company received the news and ordered the Wuhan and Xunyang branch offices to send barges and small wheels to transfer goods and rescue them. However, they were deeply trapped in the sand and mud and could not be pulled out. Later, the company sent a large ship, Huangpu, to tow and rescue them. After more than ten days of rescue, the company failed completely. The company had to temporarily send a substitute Yangtze River wheel and discuss other rescue methods.</p>
<p>The Ship Was Stranded in the Field In the past few days, the Yangtze River and Shanghai water have receded very quickly. When the Anqing wheel was stranded, it was still in the high water period, so it was thought that it was stranded on the beach on the bank of the river. However, the water gauge has dropped sharply in recent days, the river bank has appeared, and the Anqing wheel is stranded in the fields outside the river bank. The hull is deeply trapped in the mud, and there is not much draft outside the hull. If the river water recedes again, the wheel will be completely stranded on the dry bank, and the danger will be even greater, and it will be more difficult to escape.</p>
<p>The Crew Returned to Shanghai In recent days, the officers, tea attendants, etc. in the ship left the ship one after another and took a boat back to Shanghai because the rescue was ineffective and there was no hope of escaping for a while. The ship's comprador, Weng Ziqing, also returned to Shanghai from Jiujiang by the company's ship yesterday to report the details to the company. The passengers and goods in the ship have been completely transferred, and only a part of the firemen and sailors are left to live in the ship.</p>
<h3>Two Notices from the Hydrographic Office</h3>
<p>The Hydrographic Office of the Naval Department issued a notice to ships yesterday, saying: (1) The floating pile near Taizhou Beach on the east coast of the Republic of China has been removed. The azimuth is due north 334.5 degrees from the summit of the Jigu Mountain 760 feet high, and the distance is 4.63 nautical miles, that is, approximately 121 degrees 41 minutes east longitude and 28 degrees 27 minutes north latitude. (2) The depth of the Baitou Sand South Port Westward area near the mouth of the Yangtze River on the east east coast of the Republic of China and the Tongzhou Channel has decreased. (A) Azimuth: Near the west direction of Baitou Sand South Port, the distance from the floating pile of "Baitou Sand South Port South" is 353 degrees due north, and the distance is 1.2 nautical miles, that is, approximately 121 degrees 11 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 44 minutes north latitude. The current situation: According to the latest report, a depth of 25 feet (that is, 7.62 meters) was found in the above azimuth. (B) Azimuth: Tongzhou Channel, from the floating pile of "Tongzhou Channel Edge" 244 degrees due north, the distance is 2.6 chains (each ten chains is one nautical mile), that is, approximately 120 degrees 55 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 48 minutes north latitude. The current situation: According to the latest report, a depth of 26 feet (that is, 7.92 meters) was found in the above azimuth.</p>
<h3>Aviation Mechanical Expert Song Songtao Died of Illness Due to Injury</h3>
<p>The Coffin Has Been Shipped to Shanghai for Burial Soon</p>
<p>Song Junsongtao, the former lieutenant colonel and mechanical chief of the Central Aviation Sixth Team who participated in the January 28th Anti-Japanese War, was diligent in his work and rich in knowledge. He was proficient in the repair and installation of all kinds of machinery. Therefore, the peacetime and wartime work of the former Sixth Team relied heavily on Mr. Song's strength. However, in February last year, the team was ordered to defend the capital. In the emergency at night, Mr. Song went to the airport to direct the start of the aircraft. Unfortunately, he was injured in the head by a chariot and set off with injuries to assist Shanghai in the Anti-Japanese War. He continued to suppress bandits in Hefei. Due to the tense work, Mr. Song could not leave, and only worked and treated the illness at the same time, so the disease did not heal. In July, after being transferred to the Aviation Fourth Team, his illness gradually became more serious, and he was about to become hemiplegic. He was hospitalized in Shanghai. After a doctor's diagnosis, it was necessary to remove the scar tissue due to the impact of the injury. Mr. Song was eager to serve and hoped to recover from the illness as soon as possible, so he went to Xiehe Hospital in Beiping for hospitalization. After the first surgical operation, the disease was indeed removed. Unexpectedly, the operation transmitted toxic bacteria. He underwent surgery again to use medicine to kill the bacteria. Not only did the bacteria not die, but they increased. After three operations, he died as a result. People in the aviation industry and relatives and friends of Mr. Song were all saddened by this bad news. It is said that Mr. Song's coffin has been shipped to Shanghai and will be buried soon.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Continues to Report Tragic Disaster</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association received a report from the Zhenwu Branch of Mei County, Shaanxi Province yesterday, saying that since 1928, natural disasters and man-made disasters have come one after another. The general disaster situation has been reported earlier, and the extremely tragic situation has not been described in detail. The past is gone, and those who are currently affected by the disaster of mad wind and black frost, the wheat is all jaundice, the beans cannot show, the wheat does not bear fruit. In early May, there were continuous days of mad wind and hail and rain. The area along the mountains was previously hit by frost, and the lighter areas were destroyed by hail, and there were no particles. Even if there is early autumn, all the seedlings are down and the stalks are bald. The summer harvest has not reached one point, and there are more than 60,000 disaster victims waiting to be fed. At this critical moment, they call for help, or distribute seeds, or provide relief, or rescue the orphans and give food and clothing to save lives waiting to die. The extreme urgency of being frightened and waiting for orders is unbearable. According to the letter from Tong Shuming and other county chiefs of Fufeng County, the situation is roughly the same. It is found that the disaster in Shaanxi is extremely tragic. Due to the drought for many years, they have now been hit by wind and hail, and more than half of the people have died. Recently, reading the newspapers, they have also suffered from floods. Although the disasters suffered by each county are different, the deaths of people cannot be saved. The tragic situation is difficult to describe in words. Water, drought, soldiers, bandits, and disasters are common in various provinces, but Shaanxi has all of them, which is truly the most tragic and cruel disaster area. Can people with a heart who read the newspaper not be moved to cry? I hope that kind-hearted gentlemen on the sea will save the lives in danger with the funds for indulging in pleasure.</p>
<h3>The Grand Opening of the Chinese National Arts Circus</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Arts Circus opened at 9 PM on the third. That evening, the streets were emptied as everyone wanted to witness the unprecedented national arts circus. Inside the venue, Mr. Chu Fucheng and other staff members of the Disaster Area Refugee Relief Association were in charge of reception. As the curtain rose at 9 PM, the audience erupted in applause. All the performances had their unique aspects. For example, in the scene of a young girl riding a horse, the rider, though a woman, was incredibly agile. Whether spinning and somersaulting on the horse, lying horizontally on its back, or hanging upside down from its belly, her stunts were endless. There was also a scene of a large cartwheel, where a young girl's lithe and extraordinary figure skillfully avoided gravity, rotating upside down in the air, causing the audience to clap and shout in amazement. Additionally, scenes such as an elephant lifting people and a clever horse performing tricks were all very exciting. Furthermore, in the scene of trapeze artists, they were able to spin and somersault in all four directions, leaving the audience dazzled. Foreign circuses also have trapeze acts, but they can only fly back and forth, not spin in all four directions. Compared to this troupe, they are far behind. It is said that the circus has many new and exciting acts and will perform them one by one to entertain the audience.</p>
<h3>Current Status of the Sino-French University School of Pharmacy</h3>
<p>The Sino-French University School of Pharmacy on Avenue Albert, originally established independently by both sides, was founded in the autumn of the eighteenth year of the Republic. Chu Minyi was elected as the president, and Song Wusheng as the dean of academic affairs. Although Mr. Chu was preoccupied with political affairs and unable to be constantly present at the school, thanks to Mr. Song's tireless and dedicated management, the school has achieved considerable success in four years and has gained the trust of people in society. The Ministry of Education has always been extremely strict in its examination of private universities. It has sent personnel to investigate the school three times. Acknowledging that the school's operations were indeed earnest and beyond reproach, the Ministry approved its registration last winter. The French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Meyrier, also expressed deep appreciation for the school and expressed his willingness to provide material assistance on a friendly basis. Starting from the twenty-first year, the Shanghai Municipal Council will allocate 10,000 Chinese dollars annually for the purchase of equipment. At the same time, Mr. Li Shizeng visited the school several times on behalf of the Chinese side and expressed great satisfaction. He decided to increase funding starting this year to gradually expand the school and realize his ideal of a college of pharmacy as soon as possible. Recently, the Guangxi Provincial Government sent personnel to Shanghai to contact the school. All students from Guangxi who pass the entrance exam and study at the school will receive a subsidy of 300 national dollars per year. After graduation, the provincial government will assign them jobs. To meet the needs of the environment and maintain social trust, the school not only strives for perfection in itself but also does not neglect individual student training. It is said that the first class of graduates this summer has already completed the required coursework. They are now being sent to pharmacies for internships one by one. After the internship, they must obtain a certificate and pass four rigorous graduation exams. Only those who pass all four exams in their specialized subjects will be allowed to graduate. Therefore, the first class of graduates will not be announced until the end of this year. However, various sectors in urgent need of this talent have already sent letters of invitation.

<h3>The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to Chinese Directors Requesting Discussion on Abolishing Awning Tax</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, based on the previous resolution of the Executive Supervisory Committee regarding the French Municipal Council's collection of awning tax, sent separate letters yesterday to the five Chinese directors—Lu Bohong, Zhang Xiaolin, Wei Tingrong, Zhu Yanqi, and Qi Yunqing—requesting that they raise the issue for discussion at the French Municipal Council's board meeting. The original letter is transcribed below: Dear Sirs, According to a joint letter from more than one hundred businesses on Route Père Robert, Rue de la Porte Ouest, Rue du Marché, Rue Conty, and Route de Loyre, stating that merchants and residents have been operating businesses in the French Concession for many years. During the summer, they hang cloth awnings in front of their doors to avoid the heat. For several years, there have been no incidents. Unexpectedly, the current French Municipal Council has issued a method for collecting awning tax, calculated by size. The tax is at least five or six yuan to more than ten yuan. The merchants and residents feel unable to bear such a large amount of tax, so they have politely refused. Unexpectedly, the French authorities disregard the difficulties of the merchants and stubbornly insist on their own way. Recently, the police have been sending officers to forcibly collect taxes from door to door and arbitrarily imposing penalties. We believe that the installation of awnings, hung in front of doors, is very high off the ground. Not only does it not impede traffic, but it also facilitates pedestrians. Moreover, except for rainy and dark days, they are only used for about two months. In this short period of time, collecting a huge amount of tax in the name of awnings is truly an illegal and exorbitant tax that merchants and residents cannot recognize. This association is a group of Chinese taxpayers, and it must guarantee the interests of Chinese taxpayers. Therefore, we jointly submit this letter, requesting that you quickly raise the matter with the French Municipal Council and strive to abolish this illegal awning tax in order to ease the burden and relieve the difficulties of the merchants. We eagerly await your response. According to this, the Executive Supervisory Committee of this association has raised the matter for discussion. Everyone agreed that the French Municipal Council's method of collecting this tax is indeed too harsh. It was resolved to send a letter to each Chinese director, requesting that they raise the matter for discussion at the Council's board meeting and strive to achieve the goal of abolishing the tax in order to ease the burden on merchants and residents and stabilize the business climate. We hope you will investigate and promptly strive to abolish this awning tax with the French Municipal Council in order to comply with public opinion and ensure commercial stability. We extend our best wishes for your continued success.</p>
<h3>Englishman Violates Traffic Regulations in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The English Magistrate Raises a Preliminary Question</p>
<p>The Head of the French Traffic Office Hears This with Unease</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the English police court magistrate, Mr. Haines, declared this morning (the 4th) when hearing a traffic violation case sent by the French Concession, that the trial could not proceed until the French police prosecution officer could prove that the traffic regulations of the French Municipal Council had been approved by the English authorities. This move by Mr. Haines was like a bomb exploding in the courtroom. The defendant in this case was an Englishman named Chow Tat, who was accused of driving a car on Route Mercier on the evening of the 14th of last month at 8:35 PM without the rear lights on, and was arrested by the French Concession police. This morning, after Magistrate Haines opened the court and the case was read out, he did not ask the defendant whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty, nor did he ask about the details of the case. He immediately declared that regarding this case, he wanted to raise a matter, namely, whether the traffic regulations of the French Municipal Council had been approved by the English authorities. He had not yet received satisfactory proof. Mr. Jacquemin, the head of the French police traffic office, was in charge of prosecuting the case. Upon hearing this, he looked slightly startled and retreated, muttering, "But this is the regulation of the French Concession Municipal Council." Magistrate Haines replied, "Although, I do not know if it has been approved by the English authorities." Mr. Jacquemin, upon hearing this, could not conceal his expression. Magistrate Haines continued, "I can grant an adjournment and rehear the case after satisfactory proof has been provided." Mr. Jacquemin rose to protest, his voice trembling, "But traffic violation cases are often prosecuted in English courts based on these regulations." Magistrate Haines insisted that he had not been able to ascertain whether these regulations had been approved by the English authorities. Mr. Jacquemin was about to argue further when Magistrate Haines said, "In any case, it is your responsibility to present this evidence. You must satisfy me that the regulations that you wish to enforce in this case have been approved by the English authorities." He explained that regulations of an international nature in places like Shanghai can be enforced in English courts, but only after they have been approved by the relevant authorities. He then asked Mr. Jacquemin how many days he needed for the adjournment. Mr. Jacquemin replied two or three days. Magistrate Haines then declared that the hearing would be adjourned for a week.</p>

<h3>Progress of the Chinese Photography Yearbook</h3>
<p>Works Can Still Be Submitted</p>
<p>Photography, as the most popular art form internationally, has been universally recognized. All European and American countries have yearbooks published to showcase their art and culture. Because these represent the country's works, the selection is extremely strict. In countries like England, America, Germany, France, and Japan, the editing of the yearbook is done by publishers of photography magazines, as they have considerable experience in gathering and distinguishing, and would not allow unqualified individuals to fill the ranks. Chinese photography was initially very immature. In recent years, it has made considerable progress, but it has never been able to occupy a place in the international arena because there are no publications such as yearbooks to promote it. Recognizing this, the China Art Society, in addition to publishing a photography magazine, has also undertaken the publication of a yearbook. This has been announced repeatedly in newspapers for a long time. Unfortunately, since September 18th, the country has been in great difficulty and has suffered repeated setbacks, which has delayed the publication. Recently, it has been reported that the society is actively proceeding with the yearbook work. The editor, Hu Boxiang, and the assistant editor, Zhu Shuren, are both editors of photography magazines. The title is "Chinese Photography Yearbook," and the English title is "The China Photographic Annual." It embraces open principles to promote our Oriental culture. Although some of the manuscripts are already in print, if there are any excellent photos, they can still be sent to the society at 25B Haining Road within the next half month.</p>
<h3>The French Authorities Focus on Summer Hygiene</h3>
<p>Restricting the Time for Dumping Chamber Pots</p>
<p>Simultaneously Investigating Household Registration Within the Concession</p>
<p>In order to focus on summer hygiene, the French Municipal Council has repeatedly ordered the police stations to send officers to inform residents in the concession that from now on, all residents must dump their chamber pots from 4:30 AM to 6:30 AM. Those who violate the above time will be subject to appropriate penalties upon discovery. At the same time, the police stations will order Chinese police officers to conduct detailed investigations of the names, origins, occupations, and number of co-residents and tenants of each household in the roads and alleys. All information must be clearly filled in on the investigation form. Furthermore, it is restricted that if landlords rent or sublet houses to others for use as gambling dens, opium dens, or organizations, both the landlords will be punished if discovered. The search for bandits within the concession has also been stepped up in order to protect the safety and security of residents.</p>
<h3>Huang Jinrong Solely Funds the Establishment of the Caohéjing Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>Purchasing Two Fire Engines and Recruiting Sixty Firefighters</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Personally Supervised Drills Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Jinrong, a prominent figure in Shanghai, has been residing in the Huang Family Garden in Caohéjing since its completion, enjoying his retirement. He still attaches great importance to all charitable undertakings, such as the Jinrong Bridge and the Caojin Hospital, which are under construction. Seeing that the town of Caohéjing is becoming increasingly populated, he recognized that fire prevention, an important matter, was still lacking. Therefore, he solely funded the purchase of two new-style mechanical fire engines and all necessary accessories, as well as uniforms and steel helmets, to organize a large fire brigade of sixty people. They practice in the garden in shifts every day. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Mr. Huang gathered all the firefighters and, along with local gentry and merchants Yang Fuyuan and Tang Pu, personally supervised the drills. The firefighters were very agile. Hundreds of people gathered to watch, all expressing their joy and praising Mr. Huang's public spirit.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry Bank Sues Lu Gongwang Case</h3>
<p>-The Judge Hopes that Both Parties Will Settle Out of Court-</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua, the manager of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, previously engaged Dong Yu, a lawyer, to file a private prosecution in the Second Special Court Criminal Division against Lu Dai-zhi, also known as Lu Gongwang, the former Acting Military Governor of Zhejiang and Garrison Commander of Shanghai-Jiading, alleging that he failed to account for mortgaged goods, constituting fraud and requesting investigation. The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Shizhao, raised an objection, stating that the defendant is currently a counselor of the 55th Division and should be transferred to the military court for trial. The court adjourned and rescheduled the hearing, as previously reported. Yesterday, the court summoned the defendant again. The defendant's lawyer stated that the 55th Division troops have moved, and therefore the defendant's letter of appointment has not yet been received. The defendant has a telegram to prove this. When questioned, Lu Dai-zhi stated that the 55th Division troops were reorganized from Tang Yulin's troops. Due to internal complexities, Commander He has not yet reported to the National Government, and Dai-zhi's letter of appointment cannot be obtained. The plaintiff, Luo Qinghua, immediately refuted, stating that since the main body of the 55th Division has not been reported to the government, this army cannot be established. Therefore, Commander He's military qualifications are not official, and there is no such thing as a counselor. Since he cannot produce a letter of appointment, the defendant's request should be rejected. This lawsuit is actually a temporary idea conceived by the defendant to avoid the charge of fraud, intended to deceive the court, and the court should pay attention to this. The defendant's lawyer further stated that the court should postpone the case so that the defendant can submit evidence and find a way to reach a settlement with the plaintiff. Judge Wu Fanglian approved the postponement and instructed the defendant to settle with the plaintiff out of court before withdrawing.</p>
<h3>Appeal Trial Concludes in Morphine Case Involving Smuggling in Newspaper Rolls</h3>
<p>Wu Yulin from Sichuan, who previously resided at Room 3, Xinping Apartment, No. 6, Route Paul Beau, French Concession, using aliases such as Wu Yulin, Lin Xiasheng, and Wu Yongzhi, agreed with Ji Xuanquan from No. 65 Quanxuesuo Street, Chongqing, that Ji would insert morphine into newspaper rolls and send them by post to Shanghai, addressed to Shufeng Tremella Company on Avenue Edward VII, Huiji Xing Customs Broker on Mantingfang, and the cashier's office of Dahua Apartment for collection and transfer. Wu then sold the morphine, which had been smuggled more than ten times, earning considerable profits. Until the end of May this year, the postal service discovered the scheme and reported it to the French police, who dispatched detective Liu Jinrong to arrest Wu and his accomplices, Chen Xinfang and Li Quanan. They seized six rolls of newspapers containing drugs and receipts for more than ten shipments of drugs and paper, and transferred them to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After trial, Wu was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and fined 2,000 yuan, Chen was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined 100 yuan, Li was acquitted, and the drugs were confiscated, as previously reported. Wu and Chen, dissatisfied with the original verdict, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the court, presided over by Presiding Judge Zhou and judges Guo and Fan, with prosecutor Zhang, opened a collegiate panel, summoned witnesses and the appellants to court for trial. The police lawyer was Yao Zhaodi. The judge first questioned the appellants about the process of drug trafficking. Wu and Chen both vehemently denied the charges, requesting that Ji Xuanquan be summoned to court for cross-examination, and stated their reasons for dissatisfaction. After questioning, the judge ordered the start of the arguments. First, the police lawyer presented the arguments, followed by Du Yuesong, the appellants' defense lawyer, who stated that the most important point regarding Wu Yulin was the request to investigate Ji Xuanquan with the Chongqing court, which was not approved. Also, regarding Chen Xinfang's part, a request to review the case file was not notified, so his lawyer could not argue today. The court informed him that the court considered it unnecessary to investigate Wu's part and therefore did not investigate. As for Chen Xinfang, he was only collecting letters on Wu's behalf, the circumstances were simple, and the defense could begin. However, Lawyer Du insisted on not arguing. The judge then questioned Wu and Chen, asking if they had anything else to say. After Wu and others reiterated their previous statements, the court declared the end of the arguments and ordered the clerk to read the notes. Lawyer Du immediately grabbed his briefcase and left. The judge ordered the court police to call Du back to court, informing him that lawyers should maintain order in court. Du claimed that the court had declared the end of the arguments and that he left. The judge said that he should wait until the reading of the record was completed before leaving the court. Du then sat down silently, waiting for the clerk to finish reading the record. The judge announced that the sentence would be announced on August 9, and the appellants were returned to custody. After the announcement, the court adjourned, and Du left the courtroom resentfully with his briefcase.</p>
<h3>Zhao Youming Convicted of Illegally Manufacturing Morphine, Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>Zhao Youming, also known as Zhao Youmin, also known as Pi Cheng, also known as Hongqing, from Yunnan, once served as the Yunnan Negotiator for Foreign Affairs. After leaving his post, he came to Shanghai and resided at No. 448 Route Massenet, French Concession, and worked as an investigator in the political department of a certain organization. Using his false position, he illegally established a morphine manufacturing facility on the third floor of a Western-style building at No. 121 Route Mgr. Favier, French Concession. On June 12 of last year, the French police raided the facility, arresting the manager, Hou Yunshan from Guizhou, and accomplices Liu Mingzhang, Hou Lihe, Xu Hongfa, and Jin Yushan on the spot. They seized a large amount of morphine and raw materials, as well as manufacturing motors, machines, and tools, and took them to the police station. The next day, Zhao and Ou Yongxiang from Sichuan went to the French police to plead for leniency and were detained and transferred to the Second Special District Court, where they were prosecuted for manufacturing opium substitutes in violation of Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. After trial, Zhao and Ou were each sentenced to three years' imprisonment and fined 5,000 yuan. Hou Yunshan was sentenced to [omitted] years' imprisonment and fined 4,000 yuan. The remaining four, Liu, Hou, Xu, and Jin, were each sentenced to one year's imprisonment and fined 400 yuan. Zhao and Ou were also ordered to provide a guarantee of 50,000 yuan each within the appeal period, otherwise they would be detained. Subsequently, Zhao and Ou, dissatisfied with the original verdict, appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. As a result, the appeal of Zhao was rejected, and Ou Yongxiang was declared innocent. Zhao, still dissatisfied, filed a third appeal with the Supreme Court, as previously reported. It is now known that Zhao's final appeal has been concluded by the Supreme Court, which has rejected the appeal and sent the judgment to the High Third Branch Court for service on the appellant. He will be sent to prison for execution soon.</p>

<h3>Two New Ghosts in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>(1) The day before yesterday afternoon, an unnamed man was washing himself in the Huangpu River at the Dongyang Company Wharf in Hongkou. It was very refreshing. Unexpectedly, extreme joy turned to sorrow. The man lost his balance and accidentally fell into the Huangpu River. Others were unable to rescue him in time, and he drowned. His body sank and its whereabouts are unknown. The Chinese police of the Hongkou police station took the witness, Zhao Tonggen, into custody and transferred the case to the Maritime Customs Police. (2) Yesterday at 8:00 AM, there was a lighter, Taimei Yanghang No. 606, moored at the Beijing Road Wharf. At that time, the ship's mate, Lu Molang, went to the stern of the ship to relieve himself. Unexpectedly, a large wave rolled in from outside, shaking the ship. Lu lost his balance and fell into the river, drowning instantly. His body disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the head boatman, Shi Chongqi, reported the incident to the Maritime Customs Police, requesting the police to pay attention. The deceased was 32 years old, a native of Chongming, wearing a checkered short shirt and ribbed cloth pants. He had no family in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Economic Conference Under the Watchful Eyes of All Has Yielded Results</h3>
<p>From Now On, the Chinese People Will Receive Many Benefits</p>
<p>A solemn atmosphere pervaded the venue of the economic conference. Now, the agenda has turned to the issue of people's consumption. Gao Zhenduo, the representative of primary school teachers, stood up from his seat and said, "Mr. Chairman, we teachers truly lead a very hard life. But in this hot summer, we cannot avoid wearing long gowns. However, poor teachers cannot afford many long gowns, and having only one makes washing it inconvenient, because washing requires rubbing and scrubbing, which often damages it. I would like to ask the Chairman to bring this up for discussion and seek a solution." The Chairman was about to speak, but the farmer representative, A Tursheng, eagerly interjected, "Indeed, making a living is very difficult these days. The laundry problem mentioned by Representative Gao is also a difficulty we farmers share. Just think, isn't the price of soap increasing day by day? How can we propertyless farmers afford it if this continues?" As Representative A finished speaking, the worker representative, Lao A'da, sighed and stood up. He said, "What the two representatives said is indeed what we urgently want to resolve. The laundry issue is not only related to consumption but also to time. Just think how precious time is to us workers. If there is no relatively appropriate solution, won't we often face wage deductions?" The merchant representative, Tao Zusheng, raised his hand to express his support. He added, "For those of us in business, clothing must be clean and hygienic, of course. But cleanliness and hygiene require money. However, in this era of economic depression, what spare money do we have to add to our clothing? Therefore, I also hope that the Chairman will discuss this." After listening to the proposals of these four representatives, the Chairman repeated them to the public for open discussion. Jin Guangdou, a doctor of economics sitting in the front row, stood up and said, "Mr. Chairman, it is not difficult to solve this problem. We just need to have a kind of soap essence in every household." The Chairman asked, "Is Dr. Jin referring to the Golden Rooster brand soap essence newly invented by the Shanghai Economic Soap Essence Factory?" Dr. Jin replied, "Yes, this soap essence is a surprising invention in the world of domestic goods. It has a strong stain-removing power, and it saves time and effort in washing silk fabrics. Moreover, it has a pleasant fragrance and a mild nature. It is truly a wonderful product to solve the laundry problems of all representatives. You may wish to accept my suggestion and buy a box to try in major companies, tobacco and paper shops, or pharmacies. I guarantee that you will be very satisfied." The Chairman waited for Dr. Jin to sit down before smiling and saying to the public, "The effectiveness of soap essence is well known to me. It is indeed as Dr. Jin said. Therefore, everyone should try it." Before the Chairman could finish speaking, the entire venue erupted in applause like thunder, and an economic problem was smoothly resolved.</p>

<h3>Bandits Dug Through Walls to Enter Homes, Climbed Stairs, and Rifled Through Chests and Cabinets</h3>
<p>-Discharging a Shot as a Show of Force Upon Departure-</p>
<p>Ning Yuxiang Foreign Goods Store, located at No. 2307 Yangshupu Road, was established by Jing Xianzhen. Jing is a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, and is currently 43 years old. At approximately 2 a.m. last morning, while Jing and his wife and daughters were sound asleep, four bandits suddenly arrived, each wielding a pistol. Finding the store's doors and windows tightly shut and unable to enter, they used iron tools to dig through the wall bricks, crawled inside, and went straight upstairs, breaking into Jing's bedroom. They awakened Jing and the others, ordering them to hand over the keys to the chests and cabinets. Thereupon, the bandits rifled through the chests and cabinets, stealing jewelry and other items belonging to Jing's wife, worth approximately 100 yuan. However, the bandits were still not satisfied. They forced Jing downstairs, ordering him to hand over the keys to the foreign goods store's cash box. As a result, more than 200 yuan in cash and foreign currency stored inside was also stolen. At that moment, Jing's tenant took the opportunity to escape to a nearby location to make a phone call, reporting to the Yangshupu Police Station. A large number of detectives were immediately dispatched to encircle and arrest the bandits. However, the bandits had already become aware of the situation and fired a shot into the air as a show of force before fleeing. The detectives inspected the scene and returned to the police station to report, dispatching detectives to pursue the bandits.</p>
<h3>After Father's Death, Brother Disposes of Inheritance, Oldest Daughter Files Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Shen Yuqin Sues Her Brother, Yizhen</p>
<p>Requesting One-Third of the Inheritance</p>
<p>Shen Yizhen, the owner of the Shen Muji Construction Factory at No. 279 Yulin Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, is the son of the late Shen Muying. Muying started out as a foreman and accumulated assets of more than 300,000 yuan. He died of illness in June of this year, leaving behind three children. The eldest is Shen Yizhen, the second daughter is named Yuqin, who is 36 years old and has not yet married, seemingly destined to live out her days as an old maid. The youngest daughter is married to a man surnamed Huang. Now, Shen Yuqin claims that after her father's death, all of his assets were seized by her brother, Yizhen, who transferred the real estate into his name and plans to mortgage and sell it. Therefore, she hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang to file a lawsuit against Yizhen in the First Special District Local Court, stating that according to the law, the plaintiff's inheritance rights are equal to those of the defendant. Now, the defendant disposes of the property without seeking the plaintiff's consent, which is wrong. Furthermore, the plaintiff's name was not listed in the obituary sent to relatives and friends, and the announcement of mourning did not mention the plaintiff at all. His disregard for the plaintiff's position and his attempt to swallow the property are obvious. If the plaintiff does not promptly file a lawsuit for relief, it will be difficult to avoid the benefits she is entitled to from being swallowed up by him. Therefore, she is filing a lawsuit, requesting that the defendant be summoned to court promptly, ordered to hand over all the inherited property, and that one-third of the total amount be awarded to the plaintiff, and that the defendant bear the litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Mo of the First Special Court summoned the defendant for questioning, but the defendant did not appear. Only the plaintiff's lawyer and the plaintiff appeared in court to make their statements. The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Zhu Sanmao's Life Is in Danger, He Was Cut Eight Times and Fell in a Pool of Blood</h3>
<p>-Harmed by a Gangster Friend-</p>
<p>Zhu Sanmao, a native of Ningbo, is 28 years old and lives at No. 28 Lizhong Lane, Yuezhou Road. His wife, Chen, is 24 years old. Zhu works as a partner in the Dong Chengji Laundry at No. 33 in the same lane, earning a monthly salary of about 20 yuan. Zhu has several friends named Dong Jintang, Ma A'bao, Hua Zixiang, etc., who are all unemployed gangsters. A week ago, Dong extorted 10 yuan from a resident of the same lane for no reason. He was reported to the Huishan Police Station by the original owner, who ordered detectives to detain him overnight and fine him. Afterwards, he suspected that Zhu Sanmao had instigated it. He had previously borrowed 20 yuan from Zhu on this pretext but failed, so he harbored a grudge and repeatedly planned to harm him. At 8:30 p.m. last night, Zhu was chatting at home with another friend, Kong Acai (a car driver). Dong Jintang suddenly arrived and invited him out for a stroll to cool off. Zhu did not suspect anything and went with Kong. When they arrived at the entrance of Yuezhou Lane, Yuezhou Road, he saw Ma A'bao, Dong Zixiang, etc. were already there. Dong immediately took out a pistol and pointed it at Zhu's chest, and Ma also pulled out a gun to threaten him. At that time, Sanmao could not move and was as dumb as a wooden chicken. Hua Zixiang saw that the opportunity had come, so he took out a sharp blade and cut Zhu's right leg three times, his left leg three times, breaking the bones, breaking one arm and making a gash on his left hand. Blood gushed out like a spring, and he collapsed in a pool of blood, losing consciousness. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers swaggered away. A police officer on patrol, seeing this, sent the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. It is said that the injuries were too severe and his life was hopeless. The Huishan Police Station ordered Chinese and Western detectives to search for and arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Property Dispute Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Nephew Covets Aunt's Property</p>
<p>Litigation Failure Leads to Murder</p>
<p>At about 4 p.m. yesterday, a case of a nephew coveting his aunt's property and committing murder after litigation failure occurred within the jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the Fourth District of Zhabei. The details are described below:</p>
<h3>Hard Work Builds a Home</h3>
<p>Zhou Chenshi is a native of Taizhou, 47 years old, and lives at No. 612 Guangzhao Road, behind the Guangdong Guild Hall in Zhabei. Her husband, Zhou Er, passed away three years ago. Since marrying Chen, they have had no children. Therefore, there are no children after his death. However, Chen was diligent and thrifty in managing the household. Through years of accumulation, she owned more than 100 mu of farmland in Kunshan and her hometown, as well as a house at No. 612 Guangzhao Road. Since Zhou Er passed away, all property management rights have been controlled by Chen. At the same time, Chen has been diligent and thrifty in managing the household. In the past one or two years, the family has become more prosperous, which has aroused the covetousness of her nephews.</p>
<h3>Property Dispute Litigation</h3>
<p>Chen Er has three nephews: the eldest named Tonghai, the second named Zhongwei, and the youngest named Tongqing, also known as Xiaosanzi, 30 years old, all in their hometown of Taizhou. After learning of Chen Er's death, they came to Shanghai from their hometown and once proposed the issue of succession to Zhou Chenshi, but Chen opposed it on the spot, and it was not realized. However, Tongqing and others were still unwilling, so in the 20th year, they filed a lawsuit in court with Zhou Chenshi over inheritance and succession issues. After more than two years of twists and turns, it has been pending for a long time. Recently, the court ruled that Tongqing and others lost the case, and all of Chen Er's property is still managed by Zhou Chenshi. Therefore, Tongqing and others harbored a grudge, but Chen did not know it.</p>
<h3>Axe Murder Occurs. Unexpectedly, at about 4 p.m. yesterday, when Zhou Chenshi was washing the commode in front of her house, Tongqing and others went to provoke trouble with axes hidden on their bodies. After a disagreement, Tongqing and others used axes, knives, and wooden sticks to chop and beat Zhou Chenshi's head, abdomen, and other parts of her body. Zhou Chenshi was injured and fell to the ground. Neighbors saw the murder and called for help. Police officer No. 16 of the Second Branch of the Fourth District nearby heard the alarm and arrived at the scene, but the murderers had already fled far away. Zhou Chenshi was barely breathing and was covered in blood. She only said that she had been stabbed by Tongqing before falling unconscious. The police officer urgently reported to the branch and informed the Chinese Red Cross, who rushed to send an ambulance to fly Zhou Chenshi to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. The time was 4:45 p.m.</h3>
<p>The Old Woman Dies Tragically. The hospital immediately dispatched Dr. Zhu Kecheng to treat her. It was found that the woman had three axe wounds on her head, with the one on her forehead being the most severe, penetrating 10 centimeters, and the brain was vaguely visible. The nasal bone was also cut off, and there were countless knife and stick wounds on her abdomen and body. Due to the severity of the injuries and excessive blood loss, the treatment was ineffective, and she died in the hospital at 6 p.m. last night. The hospital reported to the Xinzha Police Station. Since the case occurred in Zhabei, it was reported to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. At the same time, the sister of the deceased's husband, Chen Zhoushi, had also rushed to the scene after hearing the news and immediately hired a car to take the body back to Guangzhao Road, to be reported to the court for inspection by the local security officer this morning before burial. The murderer is at large and is now being reported by the Second Branch of the Fourth District to the General Bureau, which has ordered all detectives to search for and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

Qiu was bought for 40 yuan and Tan for 60 yuan to be adopted as her children, denying trafficking. Huang Li confessed that an old woman, Grandma Zhang, and Wang's father came to her in Hankou and claimed that because their family was poor and could not afford to raise the child, they voluntarily sent him to be her grandson, and she dared not traffic him.

<h3>Cai Yuanpei and Others Offer Opinions to the Ministry of Education on Contributing to the Photoreproduction of the Complete Library in Four Sections</h3>
<p>The Wenjinge Manuscript Viewed by Qianlong Can Be Used as a Reference</p>
<p>The Library Edition Should Not Be Used Unless Absolutely Necessary to Avoid Misleading Future Generations</p>
<p>It Seems Inappropriate to Be Hasty in Undertaking Cultural Undertakings for the Country</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Still Advocates Printing Each Book in a Mechanical Way</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Ministry of Education has decided to photoreproduce the Complete Library in Four Sections, named Photoreproduction of Rare Unpublished Editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections. Cai Yuanpei, the director of the Beiping Library, and Yuan Tongli, the deputy director, have specially offered their opinions to the Ministry of Education, arguing that when photoreproducing, the Wen Yuan and Wen Jin editions should be compared one by one, and the best should be chosen. The Wen Jin edition should not be ignored. The Four Sections edition has lost the original appearance of the book and cannot be used as a standard. Cai and Yuan once submitted a request to the Ministry of Education with explanations, but the Ministry of Education did not adopt it. Yuan Tongli went to Beijing before to offer his opinions when photoreproducing the Complete Library in Four Sections. He returned to Ping today (the 3rd). A reporter visited him and asked about everything.</p>
<p>The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Yuan Tongli's Talk) This time, the government decided to select and print the Complete Library in Four Sections. The colleagues of the Beiping Library have put forward two proposals: (1) The Wenjinge edition was copied the latest and was rechecked against good editions, so there are fewer errors in the volumes. When Qianlong was in the Rehe Imperial Palace, he read it every day and repeatedly ordered the curators to check it carefully. If there were any typos, they would be fined and ordered to rewrite them, so there are many places in the volumes that have been scraped and revised. Therefore, the Wen Yuan and Wen Jin editions should be compared one by one, and the best should be chosen, and a collation note should be attached after each book. The Wen Jin edition should not be ignored; (2) The Four Sections edition has been tampered with by the curators and has greatly lost the original appearance of the book, especially the collections of essays and memorials by people of the Song and Yuan dynasties and the books in the history section. In this photoreproduction, the oldest editions of old engravings or old manuscripts collected by both the public and private sectors that can be used to replace the Library edition should be adopted, and the Library edition should be discarded to preserve their authenticity. The library will also be responsible for borrowing books from various collectors for photoreproduction and compiling them into a grand collection. For the sake of the academic future, although the collection may take a little time, it is not worth regretting. In other words, the Library edition should not be used unless absolutely necessary. In order to implement this academic proposition, the library has specially printed "Proposed List of Rare Editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections for Photoreproduction" and sent it to academic institutions and collectors at home and abroad to solicit opinions. In the past month, all parties have replied and unanimously agreed, which shows that the library's proposition has become the common proposition of the academic community across the country. When I was in Shanghai, I submitted a joint letter to the Ministry of Education with the director of the library, Mr. Cai Jiemin, stating our position. Scholars in Shanghai who are proficient in bibliography and versions, such as Dong Kang, Zhang Yuanji, Xu Naichang, Liu Hanyi, and Ye Gongchuo, all strongly supported this proposal, and Mr. Ye drafted a joint letter to the Ministry of Education, contributing the same opinions. Indeed, this work cannot be completed by mechanical photoreproduction. The collation of versions and the addition of catalogs, prefaces, and epilogues involve heavy work and cannot be completed in a short period of time. It seems inappropriate for us to be hasty in undertaking cultural undertakings for the country. Recently, I received a reply from Minister Wang, which seems unable to accommodate our proposal, but I have the responsibility of keeping the classics, and I will do my best to remedy the situation as far as my knowledge goes. Now, Mr. Zhao Wanli, the compiler of the library, has been sent south to negotiate for the final effort. If the authorities still insist on printing each book in a mechanical way, the participation of the Beiping Library will have to be considered.</p>
<p>(Cai and Yuan Present to the Ministry of Education) Respectfully, we have heard that the Ministry is now planning to photoreproduce the rare unpublished editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections, which shows the utmost intention to promote culture and benefit scholars, which we greatly admire. We have secretly investigated that this book was collated and sent more than 170 years ago, either recording editions collected from various provinces or compiled from the remnants of the Yongle Encyclopedia. Although some of them were collected from manuscripts, most of them were indeed published editions. Now, if it is marked with the word "unpublished," it seems inappropriate in terms of name. This is the first matter that should be considered by the Ministry. In addition, among the rare editions of the Four Sections, some of the original books have not been lost, but the curators have failed to collect them. Some were entered into the library based on incomplete editions, but the complete editions still exist today. Moreover, the curators arbitrarily tampered with the original appearance of the books, and there are countless omissions and errors. Now, if we compare them one by one with the old Song, Yuan, and Ming engravings or old manuscripts collected by the library in recent years, it will be even more sufficient to prove the tampering and destruction by the curators. Moreover, there are solitary and secret books that the curators did not see, but now they still exist in the world. Now, in this photoreproduction, all old engravings or old manuscripts that are complete and better than the Library edition should be adopted to preserve the original appearance of the ancient books. This is the second matter that should be considered by the Ministry. As for the books collected in the outer Four Sections, there are no old editions circulating today, and there is no other way to remedy them except by photoreproducing the Library edition. There are many of them, although there are some rare editions, such as the writings of the Ming Dynasty on the classics and history, the content of which is mostly of no value in academia. Now, if they are photoreproduced one by one in a mechanical way, it will not only be a meaningless act, but it will also mislead future generations, and the relationship is not shallow. It is proposed that the Ministry should hire knowledgeable people or organize a committee to conduct a detailed review and strictly determine the acceptance and rejection, so as to collect opinions and broaden the benefits. This is the third matter that should be considered by the Ministry. In addition, the books in the collection section of the Four Sections have no catalogs, which makes it difficult to find them. In recent years, the library has compiled this table of contents, which has now been completed. It should be typeset at the beginning of each volume for inspection. Are the views of Guan Li appropriate? We hope that they will be examined. Respectfully presented to the Minister of Education, Cai Yuanpei, Director of the National Beiping Library, and Yuan Tongli, Deputy Director, with an attached list of rare editions of the Four Sections.</p>
<p>(Ministry of Education Replies to Cai and Yuan) Dear Mr. Jiemin Shouhe, I am very grateful for your earnest guidance and respect for your views on the Ministry's photoreproduction of the Complete Library in Four Sections, which shows your concern for culture. According to the Complete Library in Four Sections, although there are many published editions, there are indeed more than 300 unpublished editions, or although they were published in the Song and Yuan dynasties, they are now rare and virtually unpublished. This time, the emphasis is on these secret books, so it is named Rare Unpublished Editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections. This is the first matter that should be replied to. In addition, it is true that the Library contains many imperfect editions and has defects and errors, which is undeniable. However, the pursuit of editions is endless, and the collection takes a lot of time. Although there are good editions, it is not easy to borrow them. Moreover, if the Library edition and the published edition are printed together, it will be the same as ordinary series of books, which may be inconsistent with the original intention of printing the Complete Library this time to preserve its true appearance. If the value of the Library edition is used to determine its acceptance and rejection, then the viewpoints will be different and it will be difficult to unify the proposals. Moreover, if the unpublished editions are re-selected, the unselected unpublished editions will be forever hidden in the unpublished editions. If they are not printed now, they may be lost, which is worrying. This is the second matter that should be replied to. As for this time's printing of the unpublished editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections, it is planned to include 127 kinds in the Classics and History sections. It has been found that only 24 kinds are written by Ming people, and many of them are excellent works and are not completely without value. Moreover, it is planned to organize a committee to review the catalog in order to collect the opinions of all parties and determine the acceptance and rejection. This is the third matter that should be replied to. Now, because the printing of the unpublished editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections has been decided, it is not convenient to change it. However, printing the bottom edition of the Complete Library is also an important task and can be done in parallel. The Beiping Library has collected a large number of good editions over the years, and has many contacts with various collectors, so it can borrow them for printing. Therefore, can the Beiping Library be asked to take charge of the preparation for printing the bottom edition of the Complete Library? If you agree, please draft a plan and report it to the Ministry for record. It is heard that the Commercial Press is also happy to take charge of it, so the printing should not be too difficult. This is a special reply. I hope you will consider it carefully. Sincerely, Wang Shijie</p>

<h3>Eight Counties in Nanchang to Pilot Rural Mobile Schools</h3>
<p>Gan Education Director Cheng Shizhen believes that the implementation of rural education lies entirely in improving rural life. Therefore, based on the needs of rural life, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education has formulated a plan to pilot rural mobile schools in various counties, teaching the most basic knowledge and skills to out-of-school adult farmers and older children, and guiding them in appropriate extracurricular activities, in order to achieve the goal of improving rural areas and increasing rural production. This plan was submitted to the last county magistrate meeting for discussion and was deemed feasible by the provincial government. The Education Department has first designated Nanchang, Xinjian, Fengcheng, Jinxian, Anyi, Xingan, Qingjiang, and Gaoan counties to pilot the program. Other counties will gradually follow suit. Each county's autonomous region should have at least one school. In the first year, the program should be held in larger villages or in areas where cooperative enterprises are being promoted, and out-of-school farmers and older children must be admitted. In subsequent years, the program will be rotated to other villages within each district. No fees will be charged. The duration of study is four months for adults and one year for children. Each year, each county and district can run at least two adult classes and two children's classes. In total, the eight counties can graduate approximately 16,000 people per year.</p>

<h3>Educational Film Association Preparing to Screen Educational Films at Various Schools</h3>
<p>Rotating Screenings at Each School Every Two Weeks</p>
<p>Fees Collected from Students at Minimum Cost</p>
<p>The Chinese Educational Film Association was initiated by Wu Zhihui, Chu Minyi, Duan Xipeng, and Guo Youshou. It has been established for a year, and the Shanghai branch was also established last month. Standing committee members Yang Minshi and Lu Shibai and others are working diligently to carry out their duties. The general association has designated Shanghai as a pilot area for screening educational films. Since its establishment, the branch has contacted the International Educational Film Association and various countries to rent a large number of educational films. It plans to implement screenings at various schools starting next semester, with screenings at each school once every two weeks. In addition to screening educational films, it will also screen high-quality sound films, newsreels, and interesting comedies to increase students' interest in watching films. However, the cost of renting screening equipment is enormous, and the branch is facing financial difficulties at the beginning of its establishment, making it difficult to proceed. Yesterday, standing committee member Yang Minshi told a Shanghai reporter that the issue of funding for screening educational films was discussed at the first joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, and it was decided to request the Bureau of Education to order each school to collect the minimum fee from students each semester to subsidize the cost. It was stipulated that the fee would be 30 cents per student per semester for elementary school students, 80 cents for middle school students, and one yuan for university students. The Bureau of Education has expressed strong support for this request and, in addition to ordering each school to provide assistance, the association is currently dispatching staff to directly contact each school. The results have been very satisfactory. However, this matter is of great benefit to students' own studies, and it is hoped that students at various schools can automatically provide assistance, which will make the association's work even more convenient.</p>

<p>(1) Smith (USA) (6-2, 6-3, 6-3) Tao Xue (Czechoslovakia) (2) Squair (USA) (6-1, 6-4, 6-0) Shan Tao (Czechoslovakia) The first group, Smith vs. Tao Xue, played first. Both players have respectable tennis skills and can use various hitting techniques, which increases the interest in the match. The performance of both was remarkable. Smith's net play is excellent, and his victory is largely due to this. His serve is also very powerful. Tao Xue ran around to respond, but was overwhelmed. Although he lost in straight sets, his performance was praised by the audience.</p>

<h3>Wang Wenzheng Enters Final of Open Tennis Singles</h3>
<p>Defeats Yu Tianguang in Straight Sets Yesterday</p>
<p>-Zheng Zhaojia vs. Ma Anquan on Monday-</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng defeated Yu Tianguang in straight sets in the quarter-finals of the China Open Tennis Singles yesterday. Wang has now entered the final week and will compete with the winner of the other quarter-final group on the 9th for the championship. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (6-3, 6-4, 6-0) Yu Tianguang</p>
<p>Yu Weakened After Illness Yu Tianguang had been ill for many days and only recovered yesterday before going on the court to compete. His physical condition was inevitably greatly affected, leading to his defeat in straight sets. In the overall score, Yu's spirit was low, his shots were weak, and he made many mistakes, which was the reason for his defeat.</p>
<p>Wang Remained Consistent Wang Wenzheng's technique does have its special strengths. He often used sharp, fast long balls to attack Yu's backhand, which was very effective. His serve was powerful and rarely missed. He ran around to respond, his steps were not chaotic, and he consistently took the lead with a firm grasp of control. Zheng Zhaojia will also likely find it difficult to win.</p>
<p>Competitive Situation In the first set, Yu Tianguang only took the lead once at 2-1, and was otherwise at a disadvantage, losing 3-6. In the second set, Wang Wenzheng led 3-1, but Yu used soft balls to lure the enemy, and the opponent still used powerful shots, many of which went out of bounds, giving Yu a 4-3 advantage. However, Wang Wenzheng still won 6-4. In the third set, Yu Tianguang's strength became more and more depleted, while Wang Wenzheng remained consistent throughout, winning all six games to the end.</p>
<p>Another Quarter-Final The other quarter-final match between Zheng Zhaojia and Ma Anquan is scheduled to be held next Monday. The final is scheduled for the 9th. Zheng is likely to defeat Ma, but if Zheng's condition is not affected by his illness, he will have a fierce battle with Wang Wenzheng in the final.</p>
<h3>Shandong Prepares to Participate in the National Games</h3>
<p>Preliminary Competition to be Held in Early September</p>
<p>North China Ball Games to be Prepared</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The National Games will be held in the capital on Double Tenth Day this year. Shandong is preparing to participate in the games and plans to hold a selection competition for athletes. A preparatory committee will be organized within the Education Department soon, and the competition is scheduled to be held in early September. Many athletes are still working hard to practice despite the hot weather. In addition, the North China Football and Basketball Games are scheduled to be held in Jinan during the winter vacation this year. The province is also paying great attention to this. In addition to the provincial government initiating a preparatory committee, a gymnasium and a grandstand will be built on the court. Football and basketball are very popular sports in the province. Although the skills are not as good as those in Pingjin, the province is also very willing to take this opportunity to learn from others.</p>

<h3>Excessive Propaganda</h3>
<p>-Si Su</p>
<p>"Excessive propaganda" is one of the thirteen reasons why Mr. Huang Shaoxiong reported the failure of the War of Resistance against Japan in North China during the memorial week for the premier, listed as the seventh item. The original text is "Committing the fault of excessive propaganda, making it difficult to clarify the truth," twelve characters.</p>
<p>"Excessive propaganda" is actually a "fault," sharing the same importance as the other twelve reasons for failure, such as "complex military system, insensitive command," "poor military equipment and materials," and "poor military discipline." It can be seen that China has suffered no small losses from this "excessive propaganda" fault! Indeed, "excessive propaganda" in China is no less than a bewitching fox spirit. Everyone knows it is not a good kind, but they like to be intimate with it. Especially during wartime, it is almost impossible to leave it for a moment. It is also no less than a sugar-coated poison fruit. It feels good to eat for a while, but it is terrible to eat it down, and it inevitably becomes a "fault." Talking about the recent War of Resistance against Japan, if the Tanggu Truce is the end of a paragraph, then "excessive propaganda" has been with the War of Resistance from beginning to end. Future resistance will still inevitably involve "excessive propaganda." Because this fault has been deeply and long-standingly infected by China, it has become a chronic disease! Not only have Zhu Mao's remnants been lingering on the newspapers for several years, unable to be eliminated, but in fact, since China has had foreign relations, it has been infected with the "fault" of "excessive propaganda." It has been eighty years in between, and it has not healed, so how can it be hoped that it will suddenly improve in the near future!</p>
<p>Since the Opium War between China and England, the traditional Chinese view of themselves as the celestial dynasty and the British as barbarians has gradually changed to admiration after the wars between China and France and China and Japan. However, during each military campaign, this fault of "excessive propaganda" has not changed slightly. During the war between China and France, Shen Bao did not follow the crowd in excessive propaganda, but instead sent reporters to the battlefield to inspect and publish war reports that were different from the crowd. At that time, it even aroused readers' antipathy, but afterwards, they realized that Shen Bao did not fail in its mission! From this point of view, it can also be seen that the Chinese people like to read excessive propaganda in order to get a momentary pleasure. This kind of psychology of the Chinese people is probably also the reason why it has not healed for eighty years. What is lying on firewood and tasting gall? It is just used to relieve oneself after failure!</p>
<p>However, there are also exceptions. Recently, President Wang cabled Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu, saying that the loss of Duolun by the Japanese army was not due to defeat, but because the remnants of the defeated army in Rehe crowded into Duolun, eating and burning everything, so they had to retreat, and the puppet army Liu Guitang's troops were able to enter leisurely, and the evidence is in the fact that Zhangjiakou is in danger! To say that they had to retreat and that they entered leisurely and that Zhangjiakou was in danger is not "excessive." However, according to Feng Yuxiang and Fang Zhenwu's telegrams of victory, Wang's telegram fully proves its "excessiveness." What is the truth? It is still difficult to clarify.</p>
<h3>Gua Sha</h3>
<p>-Qing Qu</p>
<p>These days, although the weather is beautiful, in this time when the big umbrella is stretched out high, suddenly dark clouds cover the sky, and thunder rumbles. After a while, there are actually a few showers, giving people a moment of coolness when they are suffocating from the heat. But not long after, the rain stopped, and the ground temperature did not decrease slightly, but remained like a slurry of sweat dripping down. How depressing this is!</p>
<p>Not only that, but there are also those who feel the heat and suddenly feel uncomfortable in their chests. At first, it seems like they are going to be sick, but later, even if they don't want to vomit, they can't help it. This is commonly called "harming sha" (in the local dialect of my town, the word "harm" is pronounced like "black"). This kind of disease is often seen during the hot summer, especially among women. You see, there are several fine, scarlet red lines on their necks. Isn't this a clear proof? When the right middle finger and index finger are bent and tightly clamped to their throat, the sound is also very pleasant. For fear that it is dry, stagnant, lacking smoothness, and causing pain, oil is dipped on it. Therefore, when the skin and flesh are lifted up, it is crisp and can be made into a rhythm, vaguely revealing a well-ordered number of stripes, and the more the better. Someone gave it a very interesting name, called "pretty sha," but this is a kind of art to help add charm and coquetry. I am really afraid that they are not really harming sha, so it is called "pulling sha," not "gua sha." When speaking of "gua sha," this work is not done on the neck.</p>
<p>So, called "gua sha," the method often uses a copper coin dipped in oil on it, so that the person harming sha bares their back and scrapes diagonally left and right. Not only are the red marks obvious, but if a purple phenomenon appears, then the people who like "gua sha" say that it is because the sha has been brewing for a long time. Therefore, it is common to see that after "gua sha," they actually have a body that suddenly recovers to health. It cannot be said that "gua sha" has no effect at all, but "gua sha" cannot be done by oneself. It is necessary to rely on others to assist in this operation in order to do it. "Pulling sha" and "gua sha" are two different treatments. However, when I examined many dictionaries for this word "sha," I couldn't find this word in the end. Even the Kangxi Dictionary, which can be called extensive, did not contain this word "sha." In the past, the old man of Qu Garden in Deqing said that "sha" is a mistake of the word "sand." A person who has suffered from depression and heat, poor stomach, and stagnant blood, is also like the water of the Yellow River coming from the sky, being blocked by mud and sand, and the current is also not flowing. One meaning is to treat this disease, scrape it off in strips on the back, so that the blood vessels slowly move, so as to dissolve the accumulation of wind, cold, heat, and dampness. This is an extremely simple method. This explanation feels quite similar. If we forcibly associate it with the ancient words "needle and stone," we will inevitably commit the fault of speculation!</p>
<h3>Zhabei at Night</h3>
<p>— Guan Ying</p>
<p>The dark, foul-smelling Suzhou Creek deeply marks the line between the Chinese and foreign concessions. Stepping onto the bridge, a gust of foul wind assaults the nostrils, subconsciously making one feel as though entering another world.</p>
<p>Rickshaws, lined up on both sides of the bridge, need no grand announcement; this is their first line of defense. Everyone's eyes are glued to the bridge, their lifeline. The moment someone even slightly neatly dressed walks down, they swarm forward, pulling their rickshaws. "Rickshaw, sir?" The voices carry a hint of pleading. Should the unfortunate "no" escape the newcomer's lips, they dejectedly retreat, their spirits dampened, and refocus on the next approaching figure.</p>
<p>The electric lights are so dim and obscure, and red lanterns are nearly extinct here. The road only sees the comings and goings of rickshaws, occasionally interspersed with a truck carrying sand, stone, and coal. Shiny, sleek cars like Chevrolets and Austins are a dream unseen in this place. Nor can one find on these streets the young women in bobbed hair and cheongsams or the young men in suits and leather shoes, arm in arm as they stroll on Nanjing Road. Here, one sees only working-class girls in short-sleeved shirts and pants, half-modern in their dress, and laborers toiling shirtless or draped in clothing, seeking momentary respite from their all-day fatigue.</p>
<p>Across the cement sidewalks, mats are laid out or wooden boards placed, where men who have toiled tirelessly under the scorching sun all day lie sprawled. To escape the sweltering heat of their cramped quarters and the infestations of bedbugs in the crumbling walls, they are forced to colonize the roads. Though the Public Security Bureau's grand announcements are posted on major thoroughfares, the police officers can only pretend to be oblivious, like wooden puppets.</p>
<p>Particularly numerous here are the loafer types, wearing their hats tilted and their shoes scuffed, a unique mark of their kind. The moment even a minor incident occurs on the road, they gather around, inserting themselves uninvited, considering it their act of chivalry?</p>
<p>Everything, everything, makes one feel that this is another world, a world unlike that of the concessions…</p>

<h3>Laugh or Not, It’s Up to You</h3>
<p>— Cun Ren</p>
<p>A: Good friend, can you tell me how many fools there are in this world? B: No matter what, there's always one more than you think.</p>
<p>A: Have you ever ridden a train? When I look out the window, I simply can't count the number of telephone poles alongside the track. Do you think it's fast?</p>
<p>One day, I was enjoying the cool shade next to the railway tracks when suddenly a train sped toward me from afar. In the blink of an eye, it had vanished. That train was really fast!</p>
<p>C: Yesterday, I went to Suzhou. I had already boarded the train, and my wife was seeing me off on the platform. Soon, the whistle blew, and the wheels began to turn. I was about to lean out the window to kiss my wife when the train had already reached Zhenru Station. The young lady I kissed turned out to be someone else's wife. Don't you think that train was even faster?</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: The Poor and Humble Join the Army, the Sickly Husband Falls Behind, Sacrificing Himself, Resigning and Returning Home, the Soldiers are Sentimental</p>
<p>Old Zhao thought that actually, the time his son came home was also hasty, coming and going quickly. Only today did he feel a sense of constraint. Zhao Ziqiang walked to the front yard and happened to meet Madam Jiang. He bowed to her and smiled, saying, "I haven't seen you in days, is the old lady well?" Seeing that he was greeting her so politely, Madam Jiang couldn't very well ignore him. She smiled and nodded, saying, "Company Commander Zhao is very busy, isn't he?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "These past few days, we've been caught up in inspections, and the camp has been a whirlwind of activity. I simply couldn't find the time. There are many things that need to be taken care of, but they've all been delayed." He knew that among the many things that needed to be taken care of was of course the matter of the Yang-Zhao marriage. With the topic brought up, Madam Jiang didn't know how to continue. So, she changed the subject, saying, "The courtyard is quite cold; why don't you come inside and have a glass of water?" She meant it as a polite invitation, thinking that after saying this, they could each go their own way. However, Zhao Ziqiang didn't do that. He said to her, "I don't need to drink water; let's chat for a bit…" As he spoke, he took out his pocket watch and looked at it, smiling, "It's alright; I can sit and talk for ten minutes." Madam Jiang herself had invited him, so how could she not let him sit now that he had come? Therefore, she had no choice but to open the front door and lead Zhao Ziqiang into the outer room to sit. Gui Zhi naturally would never have dreamed that Zhao Ziqiang would come into the house to sit. She was just fetching a basin of hot water to wash her hands in the outer room, with her sleeves rolled up high, revealing her smooth, round arms pressed into the basin. Seeing someone had come, she couldn't very well pull out her dripping wet arms and leave, so she had no choice but to nod to Zhao Ziqiang and smile, saying, "Company Commander Zhao has returned." With that smile and greeting, Zhao Ziqiang felt an indescribable emotion coursing through him, nodding repeatedly and saying, "Yes, yes." Gui Zhi wiped her hands, poured out the basin of water, and then returned to the inner room. Very unnaturally, she coughed a couple of times behind the door curtain. (149)</p>

<h3>The Naming of New Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Zhen Zhi</p>
<p>The latest method of naming vacuum tubes for wireless radio in the United States is more systematic than the older methods. Each digit has a specific meaning. For example, the first one or two digits indicate the filament voltage of the vacuum tube. Filament voltages below 2.1 are represented by 1; between 2.1 and 2.9, by 2; and between 3 and 3.9, by 3. Therefore, a vacuum tube with a filament voltage of 2 volts starts with the number 1, and a vacuum tube with a filament voltage of 2.5 volts starts with the number 2, and so on.</p>
<p>After the first set of numbers is a letter. This indicates the use of the vacuum tube. Vacuum tubes used for rectification start with the letter Z, and then proceed in reverse order: Z, Y, X… (currently, only the letter Z is used). The remaining vacuum tubes start with the letter A, and then proceed in order: A, B, C, D… For example, A represents high-frequency amplification, and B represents detection and low-frequency amplification, etc. As for the number after the letter, it indicates the number of electrodes in the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>According to this naming method, when we see the vacuum tube number, we can immediately know the voltage, use, and structure of the vacuum tube, which is very convenient in practical applications. For example, the number 2A5 indicates that the filament voltage of this vacuum tube is 2.5 volts and has five electrodes; the number 25Z5 indicates that the filament voltage of this vacuum tube is 25 volts, is used as a rectifier, and has five electrodes.</p>
<h3>Research on Vacuum Tube-less Radios</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The Straus Radio Company in Chicago, USA, announced startling news: someone has invented a radio that does not use vacuum tubes (not a crystal radio). The inventor is a young man of only twenty-two years named Ernest Patrick, from Kentucky, USA. He currently resides in Columbia City, Indiana. He has been engaged in research on vacuum tube-less radios for more than six years, initially keeping it a secret. Only last year did he announce his experimental results to the world, causing a global sensation.</p>
<p>This vacuum tube-less radio is also powered by alternating current. However, it does not use vacuum tubes at all, and the performance is even better than that of vacuum tube radios. According to his experimental results, the sound is extremely clear and loud, tuning is very convenient, and it can receive distant broadcasts. The cost per unit is only about six US dollars, and the power consumption is only half that of ordinary radios. Such extraordinary results are truly astounding, and it is said that the manufacturing method is also extremely simple. However, the detailed theoretical discussion is currently being kept secret, and outsiders do not know the details.</p>
<p>Patrick was born in Glasgow, Kentucky, in 1911. When he was ten years old, his parents moved from the mountainous countryside of Kentucky to Indiana. This vacuum tube-less radio was developed there. One day, he accidentally flicked a switch and unintentionally touched a wire, and suddenly he heard a sound. At that time, his radio was not turned on. This aroused his curiosity and led to great interest, and from then on, he devoted himself to tireless and meticulous research. Later, this matter attracted the attention of radio engineers, who came to verify the experiment. Furthermore, the companies in Chicago and Bedford discussed the matter and specially sent a committee to investigate, and they were all very interested. Therefore, they provided Patrick with a very well-equipped laboratory and subsidized him with 250 US dollars per month for experimental use. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Introduction to the 25Z5 New Vacuum Tube</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>The vacuum tube, known as the soul of the radio world, has seen rapid advancements since Fleming invented the diode and De Forest created the triode. Tetrodes, pentodes, AC tubes, filamentless tubes, and more have appeared, leaving one astonished. Now, a new type of vacuum tube has been released in the American radio market. Named 25Z5, it is dedicated to detection work.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Ordinary rectifier tubes such as the 280 and 82 have two electrodes: a filament and a plate. In addition to these two electrodes, the 25Z5 tube has a pair of cathodes, as shown in Figure 1. The 280 and 82 rectifier tubes are called directly heated types (Direct heated type directly heated cathodes). The 25Z5 tube is called an indirectly heated type (Indirectly heated type or indirectly heated cathodes). There are also a few differences between the 280 and 25Z5, as shown in Figure 1: the filament voltage is higher, the filament current is lower, and the filament and plate power are directly supplied by 115-volt alternating current, eliminating the need for a transformer to step up or step down the voltage.</p>
<p>Characteristics</p>
<p>Name: 25Z5</p>
<p>Use: Rectification</p>
<p>Filament Voltage: 25 Volts</p>
<p>Filament Current: 0.2 Amperes</p>
<p>Plate Voltage: 115-128 Volts</p>
<p>Plate Current (Maximum Output): 100 Milliamperes</p>
<p>Usage</p>
<p>The 25Z5 tube can be used for half-wave rectification or full-wave rectification, just like ordinary rectifier tubes. Figure 2 shows the half-wave rectification connection, and Figure 3 shows the full-wave rectification connection.</p>

<h3>Underground Antenna</h3>
<p>— Chen Qibei</p>
<p>Atmospheric electrical interference is a major obstacle to radio, even more so than other types of interference. Sometimes, continuous crackling sounds occur, completely halting the radio's operation. The intensity of this interference varies with the climate, being more severe during the day than at night and more severe in summer than in winter. As for methods of avoidance, in addition to the shielded lead-in wire described by Mr. VT, there is also the underground antenna method, which is even more effective.</p>
<p>Isolated Receiver, Sealed with Tape, Lead-sheathed Wire</p>
<p>As for the installation method, a 100-foot to 200-foot length of 16-gauge lead-sheathed wire is buried underground, at a depth of approximately 1.5 feet to 2 feet. The end buried underground must be sealed with rubber tape to prevent leakage. The other end is led to the radio to serve as an antenna.</p>
<p>However, the radio must be of the isolated type to be effective; and the power supply section must also be shielded with metal. The ground wire, lead-in wire, and connecting wire must all be made of lead wire to achieve complete isolation.</p>
<p>If an ordinary radio is used, a kerosene can can be used for isolation. The radio is placed inside, and the kerosene can is connected to the ground wire for use.</p>
<p>This type of underground antenna also has directional properties. If the lead wire is directly facing the broadcasting station, reception of that station will be better than that of other stations.</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<h3>Please Make Your Own Station Chart</h3>
<p>— VT</p>
<p>How many stations can your radio receive? What should the dial setting be for a certain station on my radio (except for radios that are purchased ready-made and use frequency as a direct indicator)? What station should it be at a certain dial setting? These are likely questions that all radio owners want to know. Indeed, some people make charts, listing the stations they have heard one by one and continuing to search for those they haven't heard yet. However, the process seems very cumbersome.</p>
<p>We know that the frequency or wavelength of a station has a certain relationship with the tuning circuit (i.e., the variable capacitor) and coil inside our radio. If the coil is fixed and the station frequency is fixed, then the capacitance of the capacitor will also be fixed. The only difference is that the capacitance and type of capacitor differ, so the dial settings on different people's radios will inevitably be different.</p>
<p>Now, by making a chart according to the diagram, inspection is extremely convenient. List the frequencies on the left side in kilocycles, and the dial settings on the top. First, find out the frequency of the stations you have heard and note the dial settings on your own radio. Then, using the method of making a general chart, look directly and push horizontally to mark the point in the chart where the two intersect. Note the station's symbol, name, Dial Setting Kilocycle Frequency (KC)</p>
<p>. For example, if the Guohua frequency is 1200 and the setting on the radio is 30 degrees, then the intersection is as shown in the diagram. Then, change to another station and write it down in the same way, the more the better. In this way, the points of each station will form a straight line or a curve on the chart. Then, draw the line. If your capacitor is a straight-line wavelength type or a straight-line frequency type, then the line formed will be a straight line. If it is a common straight-line capacitance type, then the result will be a curve.</p>
<p>With this chart, if you hear a station but don't know its frequency or wavelength, you can deduce it from your dial setting. For example, if Zhongxi is at 42 degrees on your dial, then look directly from 42 degrees to the intersection and then look horizontally to see that it is 1040 kilocycles. Conversely, if you want to find a station and already know its frequency, then just do the opposite. For example, the approximate frequency of the Central Station is 680 kilocycles. Even if you haven't heard it, you can find out from the chart that you must tune to 75 degrees to receive Central.</p>
<p>If the intersection of the dial setting and the known frequency is not within the curve (or straight line) on the chart, then that station's wavelength must have changed. (Note: The frequency of Da Zhonghua is 1160, the setting is 37 degrees, and the position in the diagram is incorrect. It was not corrected during plate making. This is a special correction.)</p>
<h3>Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(1) (2) (3)</p>
<p>(Twelve) Antenna Circuit (Antenna Circuit). The most important thing in the antenna circuit is the coupling method (Coupling). If it is desired to supply the radio frequency current received by the antenna to the detection circuit, the coupling method between the antenna circuit and the tuning circuit must be carefully considered. The method varies depending on the receiving device, and there are many types. However, to summarize, they are nothing more than the three types shown in Figure 1. In the figure, 1 is direct coupling, (2) is capacitive coupling, and (3) is magnetic inductive coupling. (1) and (2) are prone to increased noise, so they are rarely used for long-distance communication. Because of their simple structure, they are mostly used for short-distance radio reception. The magnetic inductive coupling shown in (3) is the standard coupling method and is widely used.</p>
<p>The radio frequency energy caused by the antenna is partly consumed by the high frequency impedance of the antenna circuit, part of it forms a wave shape and re-oscillates, and the remaining part is supplied to the radio. This third part of the energy is the effective molecule that acts on the headphones or speakers. However, we must remember clearly that this effective molecule greatly affects the tuning degree of the antenna circuit. If the coupling between the tuning coil L2 and the antenna coil L1 is wide, and the antenna circuit receives a small amount of energy, the antenna circuit maintains its free and permanent nature, matches its natural frequency, and can continue to oscillate. On the contrary, if the coupling between the two coils is tight, and the energy received by the antenna is large, then the oscillation of the antenna circuit is more easily attenuated than with wider coupling.</p>
<p>Now let F be the natural frequency of the antenna and tuning circuits, and K be the coupling coefficient between the two circuits, then the coupling circuit can be tuned to two frequencies F1 and F2 with the following formula: F1=F— +K, F2=F— 1-K, K=M— L1L2. In the above formula, L1 is the self-inductance of the antenna coil, L2 is the self-inductance of the tuning coil, and M is the mutual inductance coefficient between the two coils. From the above formula, it can be seen that when the two circuits are tightly coupled, the antenna can simultaneously absorb two different radio waves. If the two circuits are loosely coupled and the value of M can be ignored, then F1 and F2 are the same value and equal to their natural frequency F. From this, we can know that when the two circuits are tightly coupled, a wide range of tuning phenomena can occur. When the two circuits are loosely coupled, a sensitive tuning phenomenon can occur.</p>
<h3>Simple Methods for Measuring Wires (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>(III) Calculating the Cross-Sectional Area</p>
<p>Knowing the wire gauge, the cross-sectional area can be calculated using the method for finding the wire gauge.</p>
<p>Example: What is the cross-sectional area of a 40-gauge wire in circular mils?</p>
<p>Solution: Since we know that the cross-sectional area of a 30-gauge wire is 100 circular mils, the cross-sectional area of a 40-gauge wire is 100 × ·0 = 10 circular mils.</p>
<p>(IV) Calculating the Number of Turns per Inch</p>
<p>Knowing the diameter, dividing 1000 mils by the diameter yields the number of turns per inch.</p>
<p>Example: What is the number of turns per inch for a 30-gauge wire?</p>
<p>Solution: The diameter of a 30-gauge wire is 10 mils, so 1000 ÷ 10 = 100 turns.</p>
<p>(V) Calculating the Length per Pound</p>
<p>To calculate the length per pound of a certain wire, divide 1000 by the product of the cross-sectional area of the wire and ·003.</p>
<p>Example: What is the length in feet of one pound of 30-gauge wire?</p>
<p>Solution: 1000 ÷ (100 × ·003) = 1000 ÷ ·3 = 3333 feet</p>
<p>(VI) Calculating the Weight of the Wire</p>
<p>To find the weight of a certain gauge of wire, multiply the cross-sectional area of the wire by ·003. The resulting product is the weight of the wire (Note that the unit this time is 1000 feet. If it is 100 feet, divide by ten; if it is 10,000 feet, multiply by ten).</p>
<p>Example: If there is 10,000 feet of 30-gauge wire, what is its weight?</p>
<p>Solution: 100 × ·003 × 10 = 100 × ·03 = 3 pounds</p>
<p>(VII) Calculating the Safe Current Load</p>
<p>Usually, 1000 circular mils can safely carry a current of 1 ampere. Therefore, applying this method, divide the cross-sectional area of the wire by 1000 circular mils to find the safe current load of the wire.</p>
<p>Example: What is the safe current that a 30-gauge wire can carry in amperes?</p>
<p>Solution: 100 ÷ 1000 = ·1 ampere (End)</p>

<h3>Safe Methods for Reading and Writing</h3>
<p>— Da Yi</p>
<p>There have been numerous discussions in "Free Talk" regarding the oppression faced by scholars throughout history and their methods of avoiding disaster. Recently, Mr. Xiaoxue's article "Depressed Sitting" also mentioned many literary blood feuds, concluding with a threefold sigh, all saying, "It is better not to write articles at all." He finally stated that even reading can easily lead to trouble, saying, "Writing articles is fraught with danger, and even reading behind closed doors can bring unexpected calamities." In my opinion, such literati do not know the safe methods for reading and writing, and the arrival of danger and disaster is, as they say, well-deserved.</p>
<p>Wang Bao, a writer of fu poems in the Han Dynasty, was skilled at writing praises and eulogies. Initially, he flattered the provincial governor, who recommended him to the emperor. Upon meeting the emperor, he presented "Ode to a Wise Ruler Obtaining a Worthy Minister," thereby gaining a position in the imperial court. Writing like this is not only safe but also a path to promotion and wealth. During the early Tang Dynasty, the poets Shen Quanqi and Song Zhiwen flattered Zhang Yizhi, the lover of Empress Wu Zetian. On one hand, they wrote poems for Zhang as required, and on the other hand, they served Zhang's chamber pot—in modern terms, holding his "poop bucket." Shen and Song actually achieved high official positions. This tradition, starting from Li Si, Mei Cheng, Sima Xiangru, Wang Bao, Yang Xiong, and continuing to Shen and Song, has been maintained to this day. Anyone slightly familiar with the realities of Chinese literary history and the situation of modern literati will smile at this and understand it perfectly. The "Fart" book written by the Japanese Fukutomi Oribe recounts a story of a scholar who, upon dying and meeting the King of Hell, was met with the king suddenly letting out a fart. The scholar immediately bowed and said, "Humbly I observe, Your Majesty, lifting your noble arm, gloriously proclaiming a precious fart, its sound resembling the music of silk and bamboo, its aroma akin to orchids and musk." The king was greatly pleased and ordered a minion to lead him to another palace, granting him an imperial banquet. Midway, the scholar turned to the minion and said, "Looking at your curved horns, they resemble the moon in the sky; your piercing eyes are like stars from overseas." The minion was also very pleased and tugged at the scholar's clothes, saying, "The King's banquet is still early; let's first have a drink at my place before going." If we scholars could write like this, we would not only be welcomed by those in power while alive but also be well-cared for by the King of Hell and his minions after death. This is the safe method for writing articles.</p>
<p>The safe method for reading is extremely simple: it is called reading as mandated. For example, when Emperor Qin burned books, he only allowed people to keep books on divination and planting trees, or to study laws from officials. Emperor Wu of Han valued Confucian classics and dismissed other schools of thought. Similarly, the Ming and Qing governments only allowed scholars to study books permitted by the authorities and those compiled or determined by the imperial court, while destroying countless books that were offensive or violated prohibitions. In other words, scholars living in those times who did not read as mandated risked unforeseen disasters. Nowadays, heresies and heterodoxies abound, and various doctrines are diverse. Wise individuals should choose the safest among them to read, so as not to make any major mistakes. Otherwise, focusing on reading classics is also a good option, although these ancient books may not be able to defend against foreign aggression or save the country, those in power are quite capable of promoting them. As for those who reflect behind closed doors and introspect in seclusion, they should strictly adhere to the method of reading as mandated. During the Sui Dynasty, Zheng Yi was dismissed and ordered to read the Classic of Filial Piety because of his obvious corruption and separation from his mother. The edict stated, "Yi's wise plans and good strategies have not been heard of, but his selling of offices and perverting of justice have been heard far and wide. If he is left in the world, he will be an unrighteous subject. If he is executed in court, he will be an unfilial ghost, burdening both the living and the dead. The family is bestowed with the Classic of Filial Piety, ordering him to study it diligently." If reading as mandated could be like Zheng Yi's, we would not hear of corrupt officials. If such people existed, they would be reaping the consequences of failing to read as mandated before, and their humiliation and punishment would be well-deserved.</p>
<h3>"People Fear Fame, Pigs Fear Fat"</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>People becoming famous and pigs becoming fat are both frightening. Frightening of what? In a word, of being "eaten."</p>
<p>Pigs generally become fat when they are older. Once they are big and fat, the time to slaughter them has arrived. Thus, they are stewed, stir-fried, made into meatballs, or sliced thinly to be eaten. Because fat pork is not only filling but also delicious.</p>
<p>People who become famous are often mentioned. Once mentioned, praise and criticism follow. Under certain circumstances, whether praised or reviled, it is the same as being eaten. Eating famous people is similar to eating fat pigs; the former is direct, while the latter is indirect. Generally, it works like this: some people receive dozens of dollars each month from someone specifically to work on famous people. As a result, they can not only eat well and become plump themselves but also support their wives and children.</p>
<p>When pigs are eaten, they bleed first and are then eaten completely. When famous people are eaten, they become even more famous, seemingly without much consequence. Even if they are reviled, they might even be respected because of it. For example, A, who originally had no credibility with the public, was reviled by someone already hated by the public, so others thought that since bad people were reviling him, he couldn't be all that bad. On the other hand, within the realm of praise, sometimes they are truly eaten without any pain or itching. For example, when those who eat "famous people" want to start a publication, they visit two or three times in a single day, even leaving a note if they are not home, making it a nuisance—and a "good deed"—so one has no choice but to write some obligatory piece.</p>
<p>Another example is when those who eat "famous people" want to swindle money from a "local boss" by claiming to be on good terms with many famous people, they first host a dinner, and one has no choice but to make an appearance; otherwise, they won't let go.</p>
<p>There are even more ways to eat famous people than to eat fat pork. When rumors can no longer be fabricated, they simply talk about the darkness of the skin and the amount of body hair, which can also be considered "news," and they still receive dozens of dollars each month, eat well and become plump, and support their wives and children.</p>
<p>In fact, becoming famous is not necessarily frightening. If one becomes famous through the barrel of a gun, who would dare touch a hair on their head? And those who become famous through party and government organs will also be showered with compliments. Even those who become famous by eating famous people can use some "news," some "publications," and some other things to tout each other, becoming even more famous.</p>
<p>Furthermore, being eaten is not necessarily frightening. As long as one is eaten appropriately, there is nothing to fear from being praised, and even being reviled can be enjoyable. However, being discussed based on the darkness of the skin and the amount of body hair is inevitably boring. Eating people by starting with the darkness of the skin and the amount of body hair is truly foolish. Therefore, being eaten by "stupid bugs" is what is truly frightening!</p>
<h3>The Robber's Wife (Short Play)</h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>Characters: Judge, Bailiff, Robber, Robber's Wife, Robber's Son</p>
<p>Setting: Courtroom</p>
<p>Time: 1933</p>
<p>Place: Shanghai</p>
<p>(The trial is in progress)</p>
<p>Judge: So, you didn't know anything about what your husband was doing?</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: (Shakes her head) I didn't know.</p>
<p>Judge: You didn't even know he became a robber?</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: I didn't know. (Shakes her head again)</p>
<p>Judge: You know that being a robber is against the law, right?</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: (Lowers her head and remains silent)...</p>
<p>Judge: Breaking the law is punishable. Now, this court will determine his sentence. Since you didn't know anything, it's clear you didn't commit any crime together. This court will release you leniently. You should take your son and return to your hometown.</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: (Lowers her head and says nothing)...</p>
<p>Judge: Why aren't you saying anything? Don't you want to go?</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: (Nods her head)...</p>
<p>Judge: Why don't you want to go? Your husband committed a crime. No one here will support you. It's better for you to go back. You must return to your hometown.</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: I've already said that we came to Shanghai because we had no food in our hometown. Who knew that after coming here, we wouldn't be able to find work for months? Now, I can't go back.</p>
<p>Judge: If you don't go back, how will you survive here? Shanghai doesn't have food to give you either, you know?</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: I'd rather starve to death in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Judge: Then, what about your child? Who will take care of him? And it seems like you're pregnant too, right?</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: (Tearfully nods her head)...</p>
<p>Judge: I don't think it's possible for you not to return to your hometown. The child is too young, and it's hard to live in Shanghai. Your husband is facing a lawsuit now.</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: It's the same as dying in our hometown. I'd rather die with him.</p>
<p>Judge: Your husband isn't facing the death penalty right now.</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: Then, I'll face the lawsuit with him.</p>
<p>Judge: You didn't commit any crime, so how can you face a lawsuit? Aren't you going back because you don't have travel expenses? (Thinks for a moment, takes out some banknotes from his pocket and hands them to the bailiff) Then, this court will give you travel expenses now so you can return to your hometown. This is an exception. This court sees that you're pitiful.</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: (The bailiff gives her the money, but she pushes it away and refuses to take it) I'm not going back to my hometown. I want to die with him, to face the lawsuit together.</p>
<p>Bailiff: The judge sees that you're pitiful and is specially showing you kindness. The travel expenses are given to you—</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: What's the use of that? I don't want money; I just want my husband. (Hugs her husband and cries loudly)</p>
<p>Judge: (Helplessly) Then, what do you want?</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: If my husband is facing a lawsuit, I want to face a lawsuit too. If he dies, I'll die too.</p>
<p>Judge: Lawsuits are not to be eaten, I've told you. You didn't commit any crime.</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: What crime did my husband commit?</p>
<p>Judge: He robbed.</p>
<p>Robber's Wife: But he needs to eat, to support me and our child. If he committed a crime, then I committed a crime too. We both need to live. (Struggles, cries)</p>
<p>Judge: (Wipes his sweat, unable to do anything.) Then, then, take her down and lock her up. You can face the lawsuit too then.</p>
<p>(The bailiff pulls the robber's wife down, and the child follows behind them. The judge stands up blankly on the seat and retreats towards the back of the court.)</p>
<p>(Curtain falls)</p>
<h3>Storm</h3>
<p>— Fengcheng</p>
<p>The weather was extremely stifling, and the thermometer was about to reach one hundred degrees. Sitting at home was no good, and going out onto the street was no good either. Sweat just kept flowing, flowing...</p>
<p>I was sitting in a car going from Shanghai to Jiangwan. The car was practically a steamer, with the heat pressing in from all sides. I was breathing so heavily that I could barely catch my breath. The asphalt road had already melted from the sun, and the wheels were stuck with stickiness, unable to run fast.</p>
<p>In this kind of stifling and irritable atmosphere, suddenly black clouds piled up in the sky, the sun withdrew its light, thunder rumbled, and a torrential rain followed. In just a moment, the storm came like ten thousand horses galloping. The rickshaw I was sitting in, which had just been like a steamer, now turned into a funnel. The storm targeted this object and lashed into it. Half of the rickshaw's tattered tarpaulin had already been blown away by the gale, and the rain came even more violently. In a moment, I had become a "drenched chicken."</p>
<p>Seeing that Jiangwan was still far away, I could have turned back home to temporarily avoid this storm. But I didn't want to. I didn't want to take the road back no matter what. I thought, "As long as I muster some courage and resolutely resist this storm, I can reach my destination no matter what." Moreover, in the suffocatingly hot weather, such a storm suddenly came, bringing so much pleasure to the body and mind! I didn't want to go back and sit in the stifling room. To enjoy this pleasant, cool air, of course, some sacrifices had to be made. Although my clothes were wet, my spirit was happy!</p>
<p>In the end, I braved the storm and reached my destination—Jiangwan.</p>
<p>The current era is too stifling, stifling to the point where it's like sitting in a steamer in a rickshaw under a heat of around a hundred degrees, running on a scorching road. Young people are shouting every day, "Boring, boring!" This era is suffocating to death. We need a storm to come! However, in the storm of the times, individuals inevitably have to make some sacrifices. People who cannot endure this storm and the sacrifices it entails will inevitably retreat and escape, or fall by the wayside. Those who can steadfastly resist the storm and are not afraid to be sacrificed by it will be rewarded. They will be able to reach the bright future after the storm has passed!</p>
<h3>Ordinary Matters (32)</h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>The phone calls were made by Pei Yu and Shu Jin. They had already inquired at four places, but none of them knew where Yongsun was now. One place, on Masnan Road, said that he had returned home at seven o'clock this morning, had lunch at three o'clock, and then went out after lying down for a while. Another place, in the Small Garden, said that he had come there around four o'clock this evening to smoke, and when he got up, he had said he was going to see Botang, but just as he was getting into the car, a short, stout man in a Western suit invited him to go together. The other two places both said they hadn't seen him today. Now, the aunt and uncle were on the phone talking to the fifth place, but soon, from the reply, they only learned that he had been gambling happily these past few days but couldn't say anything else. Botang saw that this path was not going to work, so he went back to the study to discuss with Wenqing, preparing a contingency plan in case Yongsun couldn't be found before tomorrow afternoon, meaning spending some money to find out the house numbers of those two places so that tomorrow they could wait near there for Yongsun, so he wouldn't be implicated in this case.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else we can't discuss?" Wenqing said. "But the news of the case is very big. It seems that people in the 'trade' may not be so easy to talk to."</p>
<p>"Just how big is it?" Botang said.</p>
<p>"I heard that there are always thirty or forty cars every day, and the license plate numbers of more than twenty of them have been found to belong to very famous people in Shanghai. With such a big piece of fat, how could the people handling the case in the 'trade' easily let go!"</p>
<p>"Alas, what bad luck!" Botang sighed mournfully. "Today is truly a day of suffering for me! I was busy with Zhiguang all day with the factory's affairs, and we finally found a way. Now, I have to be busy for the 'old master'; the phrase 'oppressed by public and private affairs,' which I usually hear, has really come true for me!"</p>
<p>"You don't need to panic, Botang," Wenqing said.</p>
<p>"Why not! This is truly a matter that makes people anxious to death!"</p>
<p>"Of course, what you said is also very true," Wenqing said. "However, although the people in the 'trade' may not be willing to let go easily, it's not absolutely impossible to talk to them. And from now until three or four o'clock tomorrow, there are still fourteen or fifteen hours. As long as we can find the old master beforehand, wouldn't that be all peace! So I think it's best to try our best to find him."</p>
<p>"You're right, Wenqing," Botang said. "Since you're concerned, I think it's best to proceed on both fronts. We'll work to find the old man on one hand, and on the other hand, I'll have to trouble you to contact the people in the 'trade' tomorrow. If there's a way, then I can be at ease."</p>

<h3>Financial Exchange Closing Reverses, Margin Recovers by Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>Delayed Expansion Policy in the US Briefly Causes Surge</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose due to the rise in silver prices in the British and American silver markets, but the future silver prices at the metal exchange for September and October increased, but then reversed. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar rose by 8.375 points, while the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound fell by 0.5 points. US wheat rose by 0.625 points, while US cotton and stocks fell. Market sentiment improved, and spot prices immediately jumped by ten yuan. After opening, it was difficult to settle US dollar exchange rates, so it rose to over fifty yuan. Reuters reported that the US policy of inflation and reducing the gold content of the dollar, although not abandoned, was indeed delayed, which boosted market sentiment and caused prices to rise to fifty-four yuan. HSBC tried to sell US dollars, gradually pushing prices down, and the situation became weak. However, according to Reuters' report from the London silver market, the US has been consistently selling silver in recent days. General observations suggest that the US has a huge amount of silver reserves, and the future is quite dangerous. However, it was still able to recover. Afterwards, the market became range-bound, with little fluctuation. The market was initially stable but then became slightly weak. A telegram from Mumbai advised against action. Trading was sparse. Upon investigation, the market was initially firm but then leveled out, ultimately closing higher than the previous close. There were rumors in the market that France was issuing banknotes, but this could not be confirmed. The premium for cash was still 190 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 848.5 yuan, an increase of 9.7 yuan from the previous close. Spot goods opened at 8.8 yuan. The exchange market opened with a selling price of one shilling and three pence for the British pound and 28.375 yuan for the US dollar.

Fuchang, Hengyu, Dachangxiang, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, Hengxing, Daxing, Yongzhifeng, and Yongrenglai competed to buy. Maccarelli booked US dollars at 8.875 for November, and although 8.625 for October was considered settled, it gradually rose to 54 yuan, due to Reuters reporting that the US was delaying inflation. Zhongfu sold US dollars at 8.5625 for October. Hengtai and Fuyu sold off spot goods. Zhejiang sold US dollars at 8.75 for November, falling to 8.125 yuan. Shunli bought. It briefly recovered but fell again as it knew that HSBC was listing the British pound at 8.125 and the US dollar at 8.25. HSBC then sold US dollars at 8.625 for October. Fuchang, Yifeng, Yongdaxing, and Yonghengxing all sold, and it returned to within 50 yuan. Bingxing, Yuanfengyong, Yifengyongdaxing, and Yonghengxing sold again. Mitsui came out at 8.6875 for October, falling to 46.2 yuan. Bingxing, Zhaofengchang, and Shunli came to buy, pulling it up by more than 2 yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC came out with US dollars at 8.75 for October. Hengxing, Hengyu, Zhengchang, Zhifengyong, and Fuyu then sold to 5.4 yuan. Shunli lowered its price and stabilized. Foreign telegrams stated that the US was about to sell silver in London, and it was difficult to settle US dollars at 8.75 for October. Hengyu and Richang bought to 9.5 yuan. HSBC and Huabi released US dollars at 8.6875 for October, causing it to fall again. Afterwards, it hovered around 8.8 yuan. When Yuanfengyong, Hengyu, Richang, Hongxing, Zhifengyong, and Yongli bought, 8.625 for October was difficult to obtain, so it rose to 52.5 yuan. Maccarelli came out with US dollars at 8.4375 for September. Spot goods, Hengyu, Yuanxingyong, Zhifengyong, Qingfayong sold, and it fell. Dongya sold US dollars at 8.625 for October. Dadecheng came to sell and continued to lower the price. Zhengjin sold 8.6875 for October, and it retreated to 46.6 yuan. Shunli bought. The afternoon closing was therefore 847 yuan, with spot goods being auctioned at 6.5 yuan. Hongxing sold to 6 yuan. Wanxing and Shunli bought, still above 7 yuan.</p>
<p>In the after-market opening price was 848 yuan, and spot goods opened at 7.7 yuan. Huabi paid US dollars at 9.9375 for November, and Mitsui also paid 9.875. Hengyu, Hongxing, Hongli, Zhengchang, and others all bought, rising from 7.5 yuan to 9.8 yuan. Huabi and HSBC sold US dollars at 8.6875 for October.

<h3>Bulls Struggle to Maintain Position in Securities and Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Market Prices Too High, Northern Merchants Increase Short Selling</p>
<p>Sharp Drop, Entire Block Falls Over Two Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, market sentiment remained weak, and the downward trend intensified. The reasons given were the strong stance of General Feng's army and the Japanese threat in North China, but these were superficial explanations. In reality, the continuous rise in market prices had made them too high, and some bulls were exiting the market. However, short sellers were also numerous, with those from the north being particularly aggressive. Therefore, every slight rally was met with pressure, pushing prices back down. Once market sentiment had largely turned bearish, they would then buy back at lower prices. This is the tactic of short selling speculators, and it will only be exposed when faced with strong resistance. The trend in the preceding days had been characterized by sudden ups and downs. Yesterday morning, the 1918 and 1919 bonds rose slightly by two to three jiao each. In the 1920s, short sellers resumed their pressure, and market sentiment immediately shifted, with a uniform drop of three to four jiao. The "Entire Block Six" bulls therefore exited, leading to a sudden drop of nine jiao. Unable to resist, the bulls then sold off in line with the trend, and market prices uniformly fell again by three to four jiao to seven to eight jiao. The "Entire Block Six" fell sharply by 1.5 yuan. The trend was temporarily dominated by short sellers, and the bulls were temporarily observing the strength of both sides to determine the outcome of the market prices. The continued decline ranged from three to four jiao to about one yuan, with the "Entire Block Six" falling the most, down 1.4 yuan to 6.25 yuan. The total turnover amounted to 14,262,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot trading and 4.78 million yuan in total futures tax, 2.24 million yuan in demobilization bonds, 1.4 million yuan in 1919 Customs bonds, 2.9 million yuan in 1920 Customs bonds, and 1.8 million yuan in "Entire Block Six Ninety-Six" bonds, with the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Weakens</h3>
<p>A report from the Syn丰 Foreign Firm indicated that the New York stock market on Thursday (the 3rd) was sluggish. Later, due to naval recruitment for shipbuilding, the market stabilized somewhat at closing. The market situation tomorrow is likely to continue to be uneven. Total trading volume for the day was 1,510,000 shares. There was some buying of American cotton when it declined, but trading was generally quiet. According to the common opinion of brokers, it is indeed advisable to buy during rallies. Wheat trading was also light, with news remaining good. Speculators sold slightly, but because a well-known statistics expert declared that this year's harvest will be the smallest since 1866 (relative to population), prices rose slightly compared to yesterday. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 94.11 Down 0.74</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 47.23 Down 0.41</p>

<h3>The Decline in Yarn, Raw Cotton and Cotton Yarn is Slightly Slowed</h3>
<p>– Local Yarn Sales from Southern Regions Remain Healthy –</p>
<p>The yarn market trend is weak, and current demand for yarn has not yet developed significantly. Market sentiment has softened, but local yarn sales from southern regions remain good, while other areas have not taken action. This is due to weak purchasing power from customers. The outlook is uncertain.</p>
<p>(Jiaobiao Rises Only Six or Seven Jiao) The Jiaobiao market opened with a negative impact from the decline in American cotton, causing pessimism. Selling pressure remained strong, with gains of four to five jiao for all months and a drop of one jiao for distant months. In the afternoon, rumors of a yarn factory shutting down boosted buying interest slightly, with gains of one, two, three, and five jiao for all months. Total trading volume for the day was 28,200 bales. Sales included 2,400 bales from Sui降, 1,700 bales from Tongxing, 600 bales from Yiyu, and 700 bales from Dachang. Purchases included 700 bales from Changfeng, 500 bales from Zhenda, 750 bales from Lichang, and 650 bales from Deji. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Wuhu 220, Guangdong 145, Sichuan 50, Datong 5, Nanjing 10, Interior 110, Yunnan 290, Xiamen 3, Shantou 25</p>
<h3>New Cotton Procurement Has Begun at Chinese Mills</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quiet, but the situation for American cotton remains volatile. The domestic weather is favorable, and the new cotton is developing well. There are many domestic merchants hedging with forward contracts, and the outlook for distant months remains soft. However, buyers are shorting this month, and their intentions are quite strong, so buying power remains strong. However, some factories have stopped buying and are selling their raw cotton holdings. According to reliable sources, the first batch of American cotton purchased on credit by the National Government will arrive in Shanghai at the end of August, totaling 100,000 bales.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Up for Near Months, Flat for Distant Months) The Zheng Biao market opened with gains of three jiao for the current month due to buying pressure, but distant months fell by one jiao. In the afternoon, market sentiment tightened slightly, with gains of one to 1.5 jiao for all months. Total trading volume for the day was 91,000 piculs. Sales included 2,200 piculs from Chunji, 9,400 piculs from Changfeng, 1,700 piculs from Dafeng, 1,300 piculs from Yuanda, and 2,000 piculs from Tongxing. Purchases included 4,200 piculs from Yuanda, 2,100 piculs from Chunji, 2,700 piculs from Xincheng, and 1,600 piculs from Yifeng. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Falls Fifteen Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market declined due to a lack of major buyers, poor fabric market conditions, and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices fell 15 points, and futures prices fell 14 to 15 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw declines in both spot and futures prices by three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by two points. The Bombay cotton market weakened due to some selling by speculators and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, Pingar fell one rupee, Omra fell one rupee 7.5 annas, and Bairowxi fell two rupees 2.5 annas. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 3rd):</p>

<h3>Grain: Thin Rice, Sluggish Demand, Low Prices</h3>
<p>New Early Rice Has Already Fallen by One Yuan</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over forty sources. Local shops still had good demand, but the market was generally mediocre, relying on customer demand for goods. The amount of goods arriving from various areas was uneven, so prices fluctuated. Customer demand was weak, with northern merchants purchasing over 1,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songfeng, and thin rice. Prices were reduced, and the limited movement of silver dollars caused prices to continue to weaken. New early rice from the factory fell again by two jiao, opening at seven jiao, because the initial rush was too strong, causing the downstream market to collapse, and prices have already fallen by one yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were thirty-seven or thirty-eight sources from various areas along the river. Demand for various types of rice was normal. The price of top-grade white rice was stable, but lower grades were weaker. The price of early thin rice was stable, with top-grade Yangjian rice firm but lower grades soft. Dupu customer pointed rice was flat, and silver dollars continued to weaken. However, new Dong rice continued to be sold at a low price, causing prices to fall again by two jiao.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Rises, Lower Grades Suppressed</h3>
<p>- Zhejiang and Fujian Merchants Still Actively Buying -</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer xian rice was still active, but the amount of goods arriving and in stock was low. The market is unlikely to improve until large quantities of Hunan rice arrive. Currently, less than 10,000 bags of Hunan and Jiangxi rice are in stock. The amount of Anhui rice arriving by train is also low. Most of the Hunan and Jiangxi rice in stock is of lower grades, and higher-grade rice is also old. New rice has not yet arrived. There is demand from Zhejiang and Fujian, but there is a lack of high-quality goods to choose from, so demand cannot increase temporarily. Yesterday, the Yongbang merchants from Zhejiang bought 365 bags of Jiangxi milled late rice, with high grade at 7.8 yuan, medium grade at 6.9 yuan, and low grade at 6.65 yuan. A small truck of Nanjing xian rice was priced at 6.02 yuan. Fuzhou merchants bought 242 bags of Hunan red rough rice for 6.1 yuan. The price of Hunan rice was similar to the previous market, with high-grade rice rising by nearly a jiao, while medium and low grades fell slightly, because the owners of medium and low-grade goods were eager to sell.</p>
<h3>Wheat Borrowing is About to be Loaded, Weak Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a consistent downward trend. Quotations for foreign wheat showed a weakening trend, with Chicago and Canada only rising by about two to three jiao. The market sentiment has changed significantly, with uncertainty about borrowing wheat about to be loaded. It goes without saying that the excess wheat from the United States will still be dumped in China. This kind of news is unfavorable to bulls. Furthermore, the current flour from various factories is really sluggish. Ordinary factory flour is discounted by one jiao to 1.5 jiao compared to the standard price, and even those that are equal to the standard price must be discounted by five fen. The weak sales are not difficult to imagine, so selling pressure is extremely strong in each market. Factories are also successively lowering their prices, so the market atmosphere is increasingly weak. As a result, the current month fell by 1.25 fen compared to the previous day, September fell by 1.75 fen, October fell by 1.25 fen, November fell by one fen, and December fell by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3>High Selling Pressure, Futures Wheat Plunges</h3>
<p>Wheat Factory Demand is Normal, but Shows Signs of Weakness</p>
<p>Yesterday, futures wheat prices plunged across all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. Although quotations for foreign wheat were still up by about two, three or four jiao, market sentiment gradually revealed weaknesses. Since wheat borrowing is ready to be loaded, the demand for domestic wheat will naturally decrease. Furthermore, after the sharp decrease in flour sales in North China, and with the loosening of rice prices in various places, actual sales are blocked. It is said that factories in the Yangtze River area have a lot of wheat in stock, but they cannot sell the flour. In view of the poor situation in the future, such as the Nanjing factory frequently selling futures contracts, the momentum is very strong, which leads to a great increase in the selling pressure in each month. Judging from this situation of the factories, the seriousness of the situation may have little chance of turning back. As a result, the current month fell by four fen compared to the previous day, September and October fell by five fen, November fell by six fen, and December and January fell by nine fen. The spot wheat market has also softened due to normal factory demand. Special high-grade wheat from Sizhou opened at 3.86 yuan, wheat from Yaowan at 3.82 yuan, secondary at 7.8 fen, wheat from Daqiao at 3.75 yuan, wheat from Tangshi at 3.72 yuan, high-grade wheat from Gaoyou at 3.65 yuan, secondary at 5.5 fen, wheat from Liuhe at 3.6 yuan, secondary at 5.8 fen, wheat from Taipingfu at 3.5 yuan, wheat from Yangzhou at 3.58 yuan, wheat from Xinghua at 3.65 yuan, and wheat from Changshu at 3.65 yuan. Fuxin sold 5,000 bags, and Shenda sold 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Zhangdiao Green Sugar Arrives After Long Absence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable due to the shrinking Dutch exchange rate and a slight increase in funds. The guild's quota of 24 coarse sand white common goods was slightly traded at 20.55 yuan, up two fen from the previous day. Dutch Red KHG Mark remained unchanged at 16.3 yuan. Taikoo sugar rose by five fen, with B mark at 20.95 yuan, GW mark at 20.8 yuan, Zhenji cotton white No. 1 at 19.75 yuan, China top number at 19.9 yuan, No. 1 at 19.7 yuan with refunds. Guohua goods were the same price as China. Zhangdiao Qing sugar had been falling with the market price and had not been delivered for a long time. It was said that the local Gaozhuang still had 48 pieces in stock to test the market price. If the goods are yellow, bright, and dry, they will definitely sell well.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: US and French Silk Prices Diverge</h3>
<p>(Haining Autumn Silkworms Begin Shedding Skin) In Haining, the number of autumn silkworms being raised has increased sharply this year, and they are all said to be improved breeds. The weather is good, and progress is smooth. Large groups have already started shedding their skin and opening their leaves for four or five days.</p>
<p>(Jiangsu and Zhejiang Implement Unified Control of Silkworm Eggs) The construction departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly organized a silkworm silk control committee with silkworm silk industry experts and financial leaders to improve silk. They decided to start with the unified control of silkworm eggs and implement it in this year's autumn silkworms. Therefore, the Zhejiang Construction Department has sent personnel to distribute improved breeds and teach people how to raise them, prohibiting the incubation of native species and proceeding smoothly. Various farmers in Jiangsu are also starting to sell seed paper, strictly banning inferior varieties.</p>
<p>(Silk Sales in Europe and the United States Remain Sluggish) The world economy is still difficult to stabilize, and foreign exchange rates fluctuate frequently. Overseas silk prices also fluctuate with them. Yesterday, New York spot silk rose by two or three cents per pound due to speculators' optimism. However, actual sales in Lyon were flat, and silk prices fell back. The Shanghai white silk factory's top and middle grades each fell by one franc per kilogram (A grade opened at 100 francs, B grade at 90 francs). As a result, Chinese and foreign silk merchants in Shanghai are still waiting and watching. Only the Hangzhou silk factory bought ten bales of white silk and Zhonghe bought ten bales of gray silk, and prices were still firm.</p>
<h3>The Trade of Zhenmei Green Tea Picks Up</h3>
<p>Since the sale of French tea activated a couple of days ago, traders have began to take action, selling 1,300 boxes of green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Xi County, and Suian. High-grade tea from the northern road of Wuyuan was sold for 135 to 140 yuan. Tea from Tunxi opened at 118 yuan. Market price of all teas remained. Colorless heavy-volume tea continues to sell well in the US. Both Needle Tips, Shrimp Eyes, and Gongxi are consistently strong. The market for green tea is quiet firm.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth flannel sells well in advance</h3>
<p>Both Local and Visiting Merchants are Purchasing</p>
<p>Flannel is a textile demanded by Tailors making Western clothes, and is used to manufacture Western-style overcoats, but the marketplace has increased recently, with Hat Makers now also purchasing the material. With the beginning of Autumn approaching, buyers are already Purchasing the fabric ahead of time. Merchants from Chongqing and Jiangxi are also buying, causing the market to suddenly become more attractive and active. The Fair's overall trend is upward. Yesterday, both Local and Traveling Merchants purchased a considerable amount of plain, striped, checked and multicolored flannel. Material marked for five yuan is selling particularly well.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>People's Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Shi Bin</p>
<p>Thought is unique to humans - or at least it can be said to be particularly sensitive and rich. Because of thought, the foundation of "humans as the most intelligent of all things" was established; because of thought, the world became a world exclusively occupied by humans; because of thought, humans enjoy all the happiness in the world. However, it is also because of thought that humans suffer pain that is deeper than that of all things.</p>
<p>Thought is something worthy of praise, but also something that must be cursed. If we compare this praise and curse, I want to say something that many people disagree with... "The element of curse is stronger than that of praise."</p>
<p>The happiness produced by the result of thought is only a temporary enjoyment, but the sorrow that follows is often unavoidable at any time and place.</p>
<p>We sing praises to the roundness of the moon, but after the roundness comes the crescent; roundness is only the beginning of crescent. We admire the blooming of flowers, but after the blooming comes the wilting; blooming is only the beginning of wilting. In everything in the world, happiness is often in front, just starting, while the sorrow behind is chasing closely behind. People are particularly rich in thought, so when the moon is round, they can already think of the dimness of its crescent, and when the flowers bloom, they can already think of the desolation of their wilting. That is, when there is happiness, the shadow of sorrow has already lurked and will not go away!</p>
<p>Scientists exhaust themselves to invent machines, reduce manpower, and mass-produce, which is so worthy of praise. However, because of this, many handicraft workers have broken their rice bowls... many workers have become unemployed as a result. Is this something that must be praised? Scientists have exhausted themselves to invent guns and cannons to protect the country and defend the people, which is so grand and legitimate. However, people's lives have become even less valuable because of this. Is sacrificing the lives of so many people as the price of one's own success also a great achievement?</p>
<p>Politicians use their intelligence and talent to publish grand declarations in newspapers, either weeping bitterly or embellishing them... either saying how they are working for the happiness of the public, or saying how they are doing their best for the public. However, whether the results can be realized is still a question.</p>
<p>In all human affairs, there is initially a "thought" hanging. When this thought becomes a reality, many people celebrate loudly. In this loud celebration, there is then a "sorrow" that comes uninvited. We dare not say with certainty... that people's thoughts are sinful, but in fact, thoughts often turn into sins. The only difference is whether they are obvious or hidden!</p>
<p>This is something that many great figures cannot or do not bother to anticipate; it is also a small reason why we, the many small things who are unknown, cannot easily obtain happiness.</p>
<h3>After the Lottery</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>In full view of everyone, the fifty million yuan fortune of the aviation construction lottery, which many people have been looking forward to day and night, has now been drawn. The winning number is 299287, which, according to reports, was sold by the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank to a buyer from Da Yun. Other numbers for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh prizes have also been fully revealed, so the winners grin from ear to ear, and those who did not win cannot cry, cannot laugh, and a kind of frustrated shape cannot be expressed in poor writing.</p>
<p>Three kinds of drinks - please drink herbal tea, Beijing sour plum soup cold drink - hopes</p>
<p>According to what the author knows, the lottery tickets are protected so nicely by those who purchase them for their chances to be rich. Some are tucked into a embroidered little box, others in the pocket of the one wearing them. There are women who believe in superstition, offering the ticket to a glass case with burning incense so that the ticket becomes luckier. There is an old woman who had been saving her money for half a year, with the intent of purchasing the ticket, and, after the purchase, kneels before the deity in the kitchen for good fortune. Others are found praying for it after interpreting characters, or in one's dreams, to name a few. One can see that the Chinese are crazy about making money. However, the lottery has since been completed, and these people who seek money on a daily basis have failed. They are, so to say, wasting their heart and soul.</p>
<p>However, you money-grubbers, do not lose heart, do not be disappointed, do not be sad, but deeply understand that failure is the mother of success and hope is the flower of career. We just need to wait for future opportunities. Doesn't the newspaper say that the second issue of aviation lottery is about to be held, and it is even cheaper and better? It is one yuan per ticket, saying that it is meant to popularize the purchase of the masses and benefit the public. We might as well have another hope and still have the qualifications to become a future tycoon. You money-grubbers, please prepare the capital for the second issue of tickets as soon as possible. If you don't have money for the time being, then you might as well take your clothes to pawn at the pawnshop, or eat three days less, save the one yuan to buy a lottery ticket, so that you have hope. Not only in name are you a patriotic comrade, but also in practice, you are a prospective rich man in China.</p>
<p>You money-grubbers, please don't lose heart, please don't sigh, not winning this time can't achieve your goals of getting a foreign house, a mistress, a car, a big meal, etc. However, you have to keep making persistent efforts. If you can do this, don't be discouraged, you will eventually have hope. God will not let you down, you hard-working people.</p>
<p>Good, the second round of lottery is about to start, congratulations to China for having a few more rich people to complete Sun Yat-sen's goal of people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>The Gambling City of the South</h3>
<p>— Jun Shi</p>
<p>"Southerners are fond of gambling," this statement can be proven by many facts. Liang Fengjun's description of "The Big Casino in Shenzhen" can be used as some proof, but it's still just one of many casinos. The most famous is Macau, known as the "Gambling City of the South," comparable to Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>It is a territory under Portuguese rule, a peninsula bordering Zhongshan County. Commerce is not well-developed there; those who hold the financial power of the entire city are the gambling merchants—who make up more than two-thirds of the city's wealthy.</p>
<p>The most common form of gambling there is "Fan-Tan." You can see such casinos in every corner. In this small city with an area of only a few square miles, there are hundreds of Fan-Tan houses, probably because one can gamble with as little as twenty cents.</p>
<p>Some Fan-Tan houses are built exceptionally grand, with exquisite rooms for gamblers to rest and summon prostitutes, complete with dining rooms and opium beds to satisfy any material desire of the gamblers. For example, when they are hungry, they provide exquisite meals and brandy; for those who smoke opium, they provide opium for you to smoke as much as you want; if you like prostitutes, they will call them to entertain you. All these do not cost you a penny. When you finish gambling, they may even give you a few boat tickets.</p>
<p>The next most common forms of gambling are "Shop Tickets," "Mountain Tickets," and "White Pigeon Tickets." Shop tickets and mountain tickets are similar to lottery tickets, but the prize is drawn every five or seven days, and the ticket prices vary. White pigeon tickets are a very popular lottery for the common people.</p>
<p>There are also dice gambling houses where people bet thousands of gold coins; newly built dog racing tracks that are grander than those in Shanghai; horse racing tracks; as well as Pai Gow gambling houses, bullfighting gambling houses (a type of card gambling), poker gambling houses... and other various types of gambling establishments. The gamblers there are mostly wealthy gentlemen, rich men, military officers, politicians, and their wives from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places. Betting thousands of gold coins is considered very common, and most of the money they have exploited is put there.</p>
<p>An alarming statistic astonishes us: the average number of people who commit suicide in hotels or on their way home each year due to gambling debts is two hundred. These are not wealthy gentlemen; they are pitiful accountants and women with limited knowledge, who unfortunately fall into the terrible trap set by imperialism.</p>

<h3>Tomb Sweeping Delegation</h3>
<p>— Zheng Hong</p>
<p>In this tide against "ancestor worship," the term "tomb sweeping" is already seen as trivial, insignificant, and meaningless in the eyes of ordinary new people. Although there are still pillars of our party-state who lead by example and perform it several times a year—tomb sweeping—it still cannot reverse the overwhelming trend. Unexpectedly, at the National Government Memorial Week on July 31st, Zhang Ji proposed that "a tomb-sweeping delegation to Xijing should be organized every Qingming Festival in the future so that the people of the whole country can worship the tombs of national ancestors, such as the Duke of Zhou and Emperor Wu of Han, to inspire national character. He also hoped that students in schools could actively participate, as recent education has become accustomed to Westernization, and the inherent virtues of the nation have gradually been forgotten. Education that departs from national character is extremely dangerous," and so on. This seasoned strategy of the advanced party-state member is indeed a new method of saving the country, in addition to saving the country through aviation, dancing, and mahjong—saving the country through tomb sweeping. We ordinary people should faithfully follow it in principle. Fortunately, the tombs of the Duke of Zhou and Emperor Wu are not in the four eastern provinces; otherwise, we would regret it for the rest of our lives. - The eastern provinces are lost. North China has ceased fire. Mr. Ma Er in the northwest corner has long been asked by Chairman Huang to "end the war of resistance against Japan." From now on, every Qingming Festival, the brave men resisting Japan will put down their broadswords, and the diligent students will put down their books. Even the elders, sisters, aunts, uncles, and even Mr. Wang Wuneng, who is good at crying and has marvelous roots, will all bring their long ingots, grass sickles, broken brooms, and concave dustpans, and march mightily straight to Chang'an Road, towards the Duke of Zhou, who washed his hair three times and spat out his food three times, and the tomb of Emperor Wu of Han, who awed the four barbarians, to hold an unprecedented tomb-sweeping movement. Finally, they will have to imitate the little orphan girl sweeping her grave and wail together. - Amitabha. Heaven does not fail the filial-hearted. Our ancestors are watching. In an instant, the sky turns dark, and ghosts cry and gods wail. A great tsunami rises in the Eastern Ocean and capsizes the three islands of Fusang in the vast waves. At this time, the general of non-resistance, who is a guest in Europe, must also pour wine to the southeast to congratulate the success of saving the country through tomb sweeping!</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (45)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>Zhao Yishan, who was sitting across from Jie Fu, was also a failure on the road to industry, but he was still specializing in and continuing to struggle without a side business. Of course, he fully sympathized with Jie Fu's words, but tonight, the meeting of these three giants was not accidental. They were discussing the attitude towards the free city. Wu Ziqing, a banker, felt that the revitalization of domestic industry, the decline of the current commercial situation, and the circulation of finance were of course difficult to activate. He only hoped that Shanghai's absolute opening and prosperity would be the solution. For example, at present, his capital, in addition to opening cinemas, dance halls, and other entertainment businesses, was simply burying silver dollars as waste in the cellar. This was what the general public saw. The proper industry and commerce are gradually declining, but the cinemas are increasing day by day. The reason for this abnormal development is originally the result of the inability of finance to circulate. Although Yang Jie Fu desperately took on various special speculative businesses, the factory closures still resulted in losses. Therefore, he had no choice but to go to the banking sector, and his attitude towards the free city was no different from Wu Ziqing's. Only Zhao Yishan, a pure industrialist - or known as a national capitalist - was suffering in his heart. He knew very well that if he continued to work hard in industry, he would only fail in the end, but the opening of the free city would mean that his industry would be swallowed up more quickly in the industrial competition of various large capitals without any guarantee. Therefore, when he heard Yang Jie Fu's words, he could only sigh and say...</p>
<p>"Anyway, you have already turned your heads and turned around."</p>
<p>Before Wu Ziqing had time to take out the cigar in his mouth, Yang Jie Fu had already rushed to say... "What's wrong with you! When the market is prosperous, your situation will be different. Increased purchasing power will always be good for you."</p>
<p>This one-sided answer was certainly not enough to calm his fear of the large industries swallowing up the small industries. Wu Ziqing quickly followed up...</p>
<p>"Yishan, you are wrong. When our finance circulates, it will be easier to help you! We promise to invest!"</p>
<p>In fact, this was just a kind of crocodile tears. Over the years, Zhao Yishan had suffered enough from their financial circles. Wu Ziqing only saw millions of capital being taken out to open cinemas on the left and right, and never lent a large amount of capital to that industrialist who he thought was difficult to revitalize. Even if he occasionally borrowed it when his money had no way to circulate, the high interest rate always made Zhao Yishan lose more than he gained. No matter how ambitious Zhao Yishan was or how capable he was, he had to submit to Wu Ziqing many times. Now that Wu and Yang were both in favor of the free city, then his opposition would certainly not have any special benefits, so he nodded and agreed under Wu Ziqing's empty understanding of a few words of crocodile tears. At the same time, he also expressed that he did not agree because he was subdued, and he also had his own reasons, so he said...</p>
