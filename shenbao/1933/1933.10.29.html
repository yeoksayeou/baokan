<h3>錢塘江建橋之亟不容緩　願浙當局以全力促成之</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>革政而還。舉國擾攘。或兵禍之頻仍。或災饉之相屬。地方行政。大都入於停滯狀態。惟浙省以處境較裕。痡毒未深。主持省政之大吏。又比較爲有開明之頭腦者。故其歷年建設。差具發皇之象。凡涉足浙境者。瞻領彼中之市政設施。類能予以好評。正如空山足音。令人跫然而喜。亦以見人　局脊泥塗。翹首望治之殷。飢渴之深。易爲食飮耳。</p>
<p>浙省建設事業。其章章在人耳目者。厥惟交通。人民之實受其惠者。亦即在此。公路支線之添闢。輕便鐵道之設置。旣已於相當時期中粗具規模。而最近建廳擬議中之建造錢塘江大橋一事。尤可稱爲宏遠卓絕之計劃。凡在浙人。殆無不以殷切之願望。熱烈之同情。而冀當局完成此千載一時之偉圖。</p>
<p>關於錢江大橋之需要。常人固知其爲便利交通而已。若稍加以推曁。大之謂可振興實業。小之亦足維護公安。而於一般行政之效率上。尤能得意外之收穫。沾利雖祗限於一省。影響可風靡乎全國。兹就各點。一申述之。</p>
<p>浙東素號飮富。物産殷闐。祇以委輸不便。常成壅滯之勢。自有公路鐵道之施設。移多殖少。已屬視前爲便。而錢江一水之隔。迄未易使巨量産額。流轉入於浙西。大橋告成而後。則浙東西打成一片。銷路旣增生産自倍。直接所以厚地方之富力。間接亦以增他省之供給。關於振興實業者此其一。錢江交通。向惟義渡是賴。船隻稀少。因陋就簡。每遇風波。即遭頓阻。自杭江鐵路與蕭紹汽車通程以來。渡江行旅驟見增多。江面遼闊。往返需時。欲圖早登彼岸。即難免有爭先恐後之事。因是而失足墮水者有之。擁擠啓衅者有之。且肢篋之徒。乘機活動。不肖之輩。藉端需索。均足使旅客感無法應付之苦。若能構成大橋。則行旅暢通無阻。各弊不杜自絕。關於維護公安者此其二。輓近各地人民。對於行政官吏。常多懷疑之處。乏信任之念。其故蓋由頻年捐税重疊。而地方建設事業。迄未能有實體之展示。因是而引起籠統之不滿雖有守法奉公之士。亦常無以邀多數之諒解。如此官民隔閡。在行政觀感上。寗非可憾之事。今有此偉大宏壯之建築物湧現于前。至少可使人民認清所謂行政官吏。亦儘有肯爲吾人謀實利者。樹官民恊作之基礎。袪羣衆巳往之疑翳。關于推進行政效能者此其三。</p>
<p>明乎上述各點。則錢江大橋之建築要有亟不容緩之勢。吾人今敢掬誠正告浙當局曰。公等于此羣流屬望之際。應以堅强不撓之志。爲急起直追之圖。縱目前之困難。有待于藎籌。而未來之令譽。可埀諸永遠。他日浙東西人士過斯橋而稱便者。寗能忘公等今兹締造之艱乎。因此舉而使他省聞風興起共登建設之途者。非公等倡導之力乎。公等在浙服官之期。有時而盡。善政可以資後人去思者。無日而窮。公等亦知所自靖乎。抑又有言者。此舉一經著手。要當全力以赴。勿泄沓而取巧。勿因循而誤時。舍高遠之主張。以切實爲依歸能于短時期内覩此新興建築之實現。吾儕小民。誠不勝馨香禱祝之矣。</p>

<p>（巴黎）　新總理薩勞平日在國會中甚孚衆望、故新内閣頗受國會與報章之歡迎、右翼反對黨各報、目前發言甚爲愼重、内閣之組織、顯屬傾向右翼方面、故衆料新總揆在最初數星期内、可於國會中博得小多數、惟中央與中右翼贊助與否、尚無把握、他日薩氏提出政府財政計劃時、當然將臨試騐之難關、今日此間輿情、以爲薩氏未必企圖完全平衡預算、而將設法减少所短六十萬萬法郎之數、其餘不足者、擬俟法國經濟狀况有進步後、再事彌補、惟國會各界、則信薩氏目前尚未規定財政計劃、薩氏仍以彭古長外交、且宣布外交政策、將繼續前任之遺規、左翼各報皆對此表示滿意、且謂薩氏之宣言、含有法國不欲更變其國聯政策之意云、右翼各報亦要求取堅决政策、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<h3>奥國政變與歐洲前途（上）　列山　歐洲通信</h3>
<p>自從　兩國家社會黨執政後、歐洲社會上就傳佈一句流行語、說是希特勒若存在、歐洲便要毁了、這個也可以證明、時候已到了暴風雨的前夜、戰爭的預設、到處會使人心惶惑、和平運動的種種團體、不但在法律上受到壓力、就是它的意義、在輿論方面、也根本被加以否定的、戰神的翅膀、已在歐陸上伸動了、誰主張和平、人家就會告訴你、儍子、别做夢吧、看清這是個什麽時代、誰反對戰爭、乾脆誰就是個傑子、挺着脖子走路的候補兵士、一天比一天增加、巳隨處都可以碰到了、暗淡的空氣、置滿滿着整個歐洲、一切一切、都重新拉回歐戰以前的狀態、</p>
<p>這中間主要的主角是脱離不了早成世仇的德法、與正在爭奪歐陸霸權的法意、并理猜論上似乎一致、而事實上却又互相忌的德意、這種複雜的三角形勢、還要加上英國巧妙的外交、丨從不讓歐陸一雄獨覇的政策、波蘭小協約等國、爲本身利益加入扮演的一批配角、聯甲排乙、縱横捭闔、總算形形色色俱備、這第一道火綫、外交戰丨其實也是政治經濟戰、就在奥國開始、</p>
<p>這回奥國的政變、由早已實行獨裁的政府、再進一步連民主政治的招牌都棄掉、建立一個貨眞價實道地的法斯蒂政權、（但多福斯自己却屢次否認）這是充分表示歐洲複雜的政治、法德意連英并各小國都在内、不只在暗中鈎心鬭角、而是極明顯的到了實行肉搏的時期了、奥國有一家報紙、說奥國此次政變、是他們的生死關頭、其實何止是奥國、在某種意義上說來、或竟還是歐洲全體、</p>
<p>德奥兄弟之邦、這在德奥方面、尤其是德國一面所竭力提倡的德人夢寐中的憶憬、都是德奥的合併、實現大德意志的理想、但此舉動、却就夠使法國提心吊膽、所以歷來法國的外交政策、在這點上從不輕易放過、法國口口聲聲擁護在歐洲巳經成立的均衝局面、并用力監視德國的行動、可是德國的雄心、决不肯半途而止、希特勒一出、就將暗中進行的事情、變爲旗幟鮮明的政策、大擂大喊、德奥合併了、至此、歐洲的空氣、突又更加緊張起來、</p>
<p>莫索列尼曾說過、法斯蒂主義是没有出口的、這有兩層意義、第一、法斯蒂是極端的國家主義、在根本上就談不到國際間的合作、其次、正牌的還是莫索列尼一家、别無分號、由此、我們就可以明白、爲什麽意德兩國不單行動上的不能一致、而對奥問題、更在互相衝突了、拿意大利自己的立塲來說、所最不放心的雖是法國、但意對於德國也極戒備、特别是對奥的問題、奥假如合併於德、大日耳曼怪物又出、也是意大利所極不放心的、意大利唯一的志願、就是奥匈兩國與意聯盟、造成自己在歐陸優越的勢力、爲此、他就不惜暗中勾引奥國、使奥國不至於變成德國的囊中物、這回德奥衝突、意大利在後台玩的把戲、要比誰都多、雖然、他表面上裝做像一個調停人一樣、</p>
<p>自從歐戰後、奥國的地位、一落千丈、失地賠欵的結果、工業區與農業區發展不平衡、生産與銷費、常苦無法平均支配、人口只剩六百六十餘萬、維也納一城、就佔兩百多萬、所以世界經濟恐慌一來、首先遇到而受禍最深的也就是奥國、奥國雖在種種方面、特别如歷史地理種族上、與德均有深厚的淵源、但一考慮到經濟問題、這是德國所不能替奥國争决的問題、就足以使多福斯一流人物、毅然决然與德國决絕、而傾向於法意等國這方面來、爲了他係整個國家的前途設想了、這是我們所不能忘記的、奥國的目的、在經濟上想法子借到些債欵、將國家的經濟恢復過來、然而也正利用這機會、法意等國就將奥國一拉、奥國馬上就與德國分開了、這就是這回德奥衝突的内幕、</p>
<p>國外的環境旣如此複雜、使奥國政府當局苦於無法應付、而國内的黨派政見、却更見分歧、簡單的說來、奥國過去的政黨、可分爲左右兩派、左派包括社會民主黨·共産黨、右派包括基督社會黨（天主敎黨）·農民聯合黨·保皇黨、别樹一幟的爲後來由特指希勒導下的奥國國家社會黨奥國國會議員、共有一百六十五人、除共産黨力量較薄弱外、社會民主黨合計佔七十二人之多數、所吃虧的、就在於左派内部派别甚多、意見分歧、在共同戰綫上、態度時常不能一致、於是反爲少駁的右派所乘、卒至於一蹶不振、他的命運、雖與德國社會民主黨相彷彿、但情形似更悲慘、雖然此刻也在竭力奮鬭、但巳嫌太遲了、號稱社會主義城的維也納、從此無疑的要大加褪色了、</p>
<p>右派各黨中間、以基督社會黨力量最强、佔議員六十六人、在原則上、他是絕對擁護多福斯政府的、農民聯合黨領袖如前副總理永克勒、他是個主張保持民主制度、特别是政黨政治的一個人、他雖然不反對組織一權力政府、但他是反對法斯蒂主義的、保皇黨領袖如年少的親王司塔咸堡、他是公開的主張法斯蒂的人、他不單是與莫索列尼很接近、就與希特勒也很默契、（他於一九二三年在德國明星讀書時、曾參加過希特勒的暴動、）他是希望復辟而再實行法斯蒂主義的、多福斯本人、則介乎上述的二者之間、他爲了奥國的需要、曾堅决的决定反對希特勒、他用起黨派的口號、組織一「祖國前衛」一種半含軍事性質的組織、此刻他就以這組織爲基礎、實行組成他個人獨裁的政府、</p>
<p>今年七八月後、德奥的衝突、顯然更見嚴重、同時國内情形亦日趨複雜、多福斯聯合政府、頗感到窮於對付、雖然已實行了軍事獨裁、一切權力操於保安司令或警察總監的手上、對於國家社會黨的活動、取締極嚴、明令凡掛有卍字希黨徽章或唱希黨黨歌者、處罰六星期監禁或二千先令（約一千多華幣）罰金、一面盡力搜捕國家社會黨的活動份子、同時更在民衆方面盡量用傳單小册子壁報佈告演講等等方法宣傳、竭力宣佈國家社會黨的叛國行爲、詞句似乎很極端的、例如稱國家社會黨爲「傳染病」「棕色鼠疫」或「日耳曼式的共産黨」使在社會方面另造成一種空氣、就是凡國家社會黨人、即公認爲不道德的敗類、而奥國的英雄、是隸屬於「祖國前衛」或「保衛團」等團體的人們、這點多福斯政府的努力顯然已有相當在成功、但究還未能根本上加以解决、</p>

<h3>開封金融風潮　同和裕銀號發生擠兌　劉峙力勸各銀行維持</h3>
<p>開封通訊、開封各大銀行、近對本地銀號、持不合作主義、致信昌旣倒閉、同和裕又發生擠兌、當局以其關係市面金融甚大、對於各銀號均力謀維持、旬前曾由劉峙飭建設廳長召集中央·中國·交通·上海·金城等銀行、議定維持同和裕辦法、並由省府佈告自十四日起至二十四日止、限定儲户提取活期存欵、不得過五百元、定期不得提取、旬日以來、社會人心、巳稍安定、至各大銀行議定維持同和裕辦法、係恊助該號五十六萬元、以資週轉、各行本以打倒同和裕爲目的、其時所以允許恊欵者、無非碍於官廳面子、不得不虚與委蛇、故自該項辦法决定後、各行始而藉口抵押問題、不肯恊欵、繼而同和裕新鄉電汽公司·及焦作七十萬元之存煤之百餘萬抵押到手、仍不肯出欵、在此交涉期中、祇河南農工銀行出欵五萬、其餘各行、僅由劉峙及商會等私人名義担保、付欵數千元、故開封各界民衆、對於各行、頗爲不滿、</p>
<p>同和裕儲户、以同和裕此次發生擠兌、純係受同業排擠所致、特於日前組織代表委員會、會商維持該號辦法、該會已於前日舉行第一次會議、除議决儲户自動限制提欵辦法外、並决定維持同和裕營業辦法三項、（一）呈請政府將十月十四日佈告提欵辦法、延長十日、（二）請政府運用政治力量、與各銀行接洽、履行前議、於七日内籌墊五十六萬元、以應付該號活期存欵、（三）此次同和裕擠兌、市面金融、發生恐慌、政府一再約同各銀行出力維持、而各行始允中變、本代表會應向各銀行予以警告、</p>

<h3>晉煤無法推銷　原因運費奇昻　擴廠紛紛倒閉</h3>
<p>太原遵訊、我國煤業、素稱豐富、年來外煤傾銷、與日俱進、國煤廠家、大受影響、停業者停業、减工者减工、自九一八後、各地更發生煤荒、晋省煤業、尤受莫大影響、頃向擴商調查、始悉其主要原因、實爲運費太高、就中以平綏·正太·兩路爲尤甚、因之國煤未能暢銷、而外煤遂乘機輸入、礦商紛紛倒閉、幾致無法維持、兹將華北各路煤運詳情、探誌如左、以備關心吾國煤業者之參考、</p>
<h3>正太路</h3>
<p>就煤質言、山西平定所産之無烟硬煤、及大同所産之清煤、均極優良、就藴藏而言、山西礦有五百六十餘萬萬噸、足供世界數千年之用、久爲外人所覬覦、惟以運費太高、不能盡量開採、供給各地需要、查正太路所定運費、對於各礦懸殊太甚、其最低者爲井陘煤、每噸每公里運費爲六厘二一四七、其次爲寳昌及民興煤、每噸每公里運費爲一分八厘一○五二七、再次爲正豐煤、每噸每公里運費爲九四一二、最高者爲陽泉保晋各煤、每噸每公里運費爲二分五厘、與井陘煤相比、幾高四倍餘、又查該路定有回扣辦法、但限度太高、實際不易享受、如甲種回扣、由一萬零一噸至二萬噸、每車（二十五噸以下同）僅回扣四元四角、每噸每公里運費爲二分三厘五八六八、二萬○一噸至四萬噸、每車回扣五元、每噸每公里運費爲二分三厘三八八五四萬○一噸至六萬噸、每車回扣五元六角、每噸每公里運費爲二分三厘一九○八、六萬噸以上、每車回扣六元二角五分、每噸每公里運費爲二分二厘九七五三、乙種回扣辦法、分六萬噸至十二萬噸、十二萬噸至十八萬噸、十八萬噸至二十四萬噸、及二十四萬噸以上四種、依噸數之多寡、定回扣之大小、就表面觀之、似屬優待、但實際上陽泉硬煤、因該路車小軌窄、每家每月未曾有運出六萬噸以上者、且决無此希望也、所以乙種回扣辦法、直等於畫餅充飢、此晋煤不能出口主要原因也、</p>
<h3>平漢路</h3>
<p>平漢煤運、較正太爲低、其待遇亦不一致、如六河溝福中怡立正豐各礦、每噸每公里運費均爲六厘八二五、井經煤每噸每公里運費爲一分一厘九三五、（按平漢普通運價第三欵之七成核收）而晋煤運費、則每噸每公里運費爲一分七厘○五、（按平漢普通運價第三二欵核收）是晋煤不惟不能與六河溝福中怡立等、享受六厘八二五之平等待遇、卽井陘所享之七成運費、亦不能援例、</p>
<h3>平綏路</h3>
<p>平綏路之晋北煤、前定出口專價、約合一分六六二、嗣聞各礦商請減輕、始改爲九厘一八一一、但仍以一年爲限、且僅限於出口者、始能享受此專價、</p>
<h3>北寗路</h3>

<h3>其他路</h3>
<p>此外湘鄂路之漢冶萍、每噸每公里爲六厘四二、膠濟路之魯大煤、每噸每公里爲七厘六一、華商各煤礦爲七厘二、故我國煤藏雖富、而目前産量則甚少、每年二千五六百萬噸之消耗量中、國煤僅佔一千一百萬噸、尚不及半、其餘均爲外煤所傾銷、其主要原因、爲運費道高、以致成本甚重、不能暢銷全國、就中以山西煤藏爲最富、而運費亦以正太平綏兩路爲最高、致陽泉大同各處所産之煤、囤積如山、無法銷售、（聞大同一帶煤廠、每日可出煤五千噸）、現以平綏路煤運過高、不能暢銷之故、减少産量、每日只出三四百噸、各産煤廠、迫不得巳、率各裁員减工、縮小範圍、坐使貨棄於地、失業者加多、良用嘆息、若不急圖挽救、前途危險、殊不堪設想也、（二十四日）</p>

<h3>本市貧民借本設七辦事處</h3>
<p>市社會局與戰區善後委員會舉辦之貧民借本、以資救濟貧民、並爲調劑金融、俾社會經濟得以流通事、中央社記者昨特以此問諸社會局、管理貧民借本之負責人、據談如下、</p>
<h3>經過情形</h3>
<p>在一二八以前、全市貧民借本事、均由社會局主辦、共分南市閘北兩借本處、社會局原有資金約四萬餘、年來因利息贏餘、加至四萬五千金、但閘北方面、因戰後收本無着、江北貧民或逃或死、難以追索、故損失當在三千金以上、現閘北方面、因已有戰區善後會舉辦之貧民借本處、規模較大、且委托社會局代辦、故局方即將舊主辦之閘北貧民借本處停止、專辦南市一處</p>
<h3>現在狀况</h3>
<p>戰區善後委員會主辦之借本處、由財政部撥來二十五萬元前次賽馬慈善券所得又十七萬元、合併數目爲四十二萬元、惟社會局代辦處、已收到實數爲三十六萬元、其餘因非急需、尚未完全領取、此數目中有二十萬元、由敎育局領去、撥付爲戰區學校救濟、至於借本辦事處、共設七處、（一）閘北區、（二）江灣區（三）殷行區、（四）引翔區、（五）眞如區、（六）吳淞區、（七）彭浦區、</p>
<h3>借本種類</h3>
<p>至借本處借本辦法、共分四種、第一種貧民借本、第二種農事借本、第三種建屋借本、第四種小工業借本、農事借本、以該農民之田地契據作抵押品、建屋借本係興復災區計劃之一、以便災民在閘北方面恢復舊業、小工業借本、如織襪廠及棉毛銅鐵玻璃器具等小本經營、均可向該處挪借、且不取利息、借出之數、自五十元至五百元爲止、分四年償還、至於建屋借本、以江灣區領去爲最多、計共十萬元、</p>
<h3>償還辦法</h3>
<p>社會局借本處與戰區善後委員會之借本處性質略有不同、該會所辦之借本處、完全爲慈善性質、而社會局方面則爲調劑社會之經濟、不全爲慈善事業、故須取微息、例如借欵二十元、與小本商販、着令按日償還一元、至償完爲止、取利二角三分、但爲防其避債逸逃計、須明瞭其住處、並須着令請一店舖作保、必要時仍由公安局方面會同該局合辦云、</p>

<h3>建造原委</h3>
<p>上海市興業信託社經辦本市浦江輪渡、擴充改進、不遺餘力、現有新輪大小不下十餘艘、浦江兩岸行旅、無不稱便、現有長渡航綫、僅有上海銅人碼頭經過西渡慶寺等東溝高橋爲止、而市府劃定油池區域之老鼠沙及吳淞兩處之交通、尚形不便、故該社不惜鉅資、費銀十五萬元、添建五號大渡輪一艘、加入原有長渡四輪行駛、將航綫展長至吳淞、完成浦江北段之交通建設、</p>
<h3>構造概要</h3>
<p>該輪構造長一百二十呎、闊二十一呎、深九呎半、吃水五呎半、排水量一百九十五噸用六汽缸三百三十四馬力之柴油引擎發動、速度十二海哩、載客六百人、下層爲二等艙、全用靠背椅、刷以頭號京漆、每座均有三角形木條間隔、使乘客不得躺臥、光線空氣均極充足、爲任何江輪所不及、中層前部爲頭等艙坐椅、概用柚木、椅背照人體背之曲線製成、後部爲二等散艙、兼裝貨物、上層爲特等艙、艙居中部、内設酒排檯、用義大利大理石製成、冬季有暖氣爐、利用柴油引擎揮發之熱氣、可使艙内温度增高、其内部佈置之精美、不在外洋輪船之下、雖一衣鈎之微、亦有特殊之優點、其門窗開關及門鎖等、均在德國名廠仿柏林地道車所用者定造、艙之後部有音樂台一座、甲板概用柚木、并用機器磨光、關於安全方面備有充分之救命圈及救生浮筒、消防設備、除救火藥水外、每層均另備救火龍頭、可謂雙重安全、關於技術方面、全輪水綫豐腴、下部裝八寸寬浮水兩道、雖滿載乘客、亦無傾斜之弊、船頭採最新之軍艦式、倘不宰與他船相撞、其水綫下部無被撞之虞、船航作水流綫式、形如魚背、此尚爲東方造船界中初次使用、其優點爲轉動輕便、同時增加航行速率、統觀該輪設備、其頭等艙及二等艙清潔簡單、適合普通旅客、特等艙精雅華美、適合於往來游客、其實際對於各種搭乘之需要、均能切合、此乃該輪特殊之優點也、</p>

<h3>統制經濟之兩大原則</h3>
<p>— 穆藕初</p>
<p>人生而有羣、亦卽生而有社會生活、在人羣開始經營社會生活之時、「分工」亦卽由而發生、</p>
<p>分工爲增加生産能力之最重要之手段、亦卽爲足以發揮無窮偉大之生産能力之手段、蓋爲毫無可疑之事實、美汽車大王亨利福特曾有言曰、『分工再分工爲增加生産之要諦、』經濟學者亞丹史密斯、在其有名之國富論中、亦以分工爲增加國富之第一要素、彼舉製針一業之分工爲例、謂分工足以增加一人之生産力、至四千八百倍、而最近且有人謂分工足以增加人力至數萬倍、以至數百萬倍、</p>
<p>在古代大家族制度之下、依男女性别而舉行之分工、已爲經濟史家所證實、不過此種分工、爲由於人類生活之自然必要而發生、故其生産力之增大、僅爲有限、而不能爲無限、至於較爲具體之最初分工、乃爲以職業爲準繩、卽首將從來都須一人動手所作之工作、分爲木匠鐵匠商人等、而成爲一種專長職業、經濟愈發達則此種職業别之分工亦愈緊、</p>
<p>此種分工方式、大概可分爲二類、一爲同一職業、但由於其所從事製造之物品、各各不同、遂各以其所從事製造者、爲其專門之工作、如同爲木匠、則有造屋之木匠、造船之木匠、以及作細工之木匠之分、是另一則爲將從來爲一人所從事之一個生産過程、分爲若干製造過程、而各從事其一部分之工作、如紡紗織布染色等是、更由此進而分化、則爲每一人僅作其中之部分工作、集數十人或數百人各個不同之工作、乃能完成一個整體之經營、</p>
<p>爲使其易於明瞭計、兹將分工之進步、及其分化之方式、圖示如下、</p>
<p>職業别分業</p>
<p>生活丨無分業的勞動　　　　　　　　專門的　技術的分業</p>
<p>職業别　　職業　　技術的分業</p>
<p>分業</p>
<p>生産的　技術的分業</p>
<p>分業　　技術的分業</p>
<p>今更請以一例爲之說明、以住宅一事而言、吾人欲建一住宅、首必有普通包工工人、次又必集合木匠泥水匠以及其他種種之工人、而木匠中則除普通之木匠外、又尚有專門細工之木匠、若再就財貨一方面而言、則木匠所加工之木材、考其來源、又須有伐木者與搬運者、火車輪船、以及將此木材鋸爲木板之製材公司、與搬運木板之運輸公司、以至其他各種各色之商人、而在火車輪船製材公司内、更有各種各式之專門工人、且此種火車輪船製材公司、又皆無不爲綜集數千人各種專門之勞動而成、住宅如是、其他如衣服食事、蓋無不如是、惟其如是、而每一生産、乃能合乎經濟的原則而進行、而又由此種生産物之積纍、吾人之文化生活、乃日見進步、故分工實爲人類文化生活之基礎也、</p>
<p>雖然、分工固爲人類文化生活之基礎、但另有一重要之條件、在吾人尤不容稍忽、此一條件、卽爲各部之調整、换言之、卽吾人於分工之後、如何使此支離破碎之各别工作之相互間、無矛盾、無衝突、而予以最合理最合目的之聯絡、此一問題、最爲重要、今日世人所倡導之科學管理法·産業合理化·以至所謂統制經濟等等、要都不外爲對此一問題之解决、方法之推進耳、吾人兹請就各部之調整一問題作更進一步之闡述（未完）</p>

<h3>人才不平均優游敗於法商　結果四對八　法商名將會集確係勁敵</h3>
<p>自江善敬陳家球鍾勇森梁樹棠曁南四戰士、相率加入優游後、優游陣綫爲之一新、實力加厚、乃不幸昨日西聯會之第一戰、卽遭逢勁敵法商、出馬不利、竟以四對八受挫、裁判員勃脱、</p>
<h3>法商陣綫</h3>
<p>加尼爾　Ｊ華特</p>
<p>鮑傑斯　　　　　　鮑休脱</p>
<p>福祿夀　　　　　　　派　克　柯萊脱</p>
<p>尼各列夫　　　　　Ｗ華特</p>
<p>雷米迪　法凡却</p>
<h3>優游陣綫</h3>
<p>梁樹棠　李碩友</p>
<p>王樹森　　　　　　孫錦順</p>
<p>王才高　　　　　　　黄瑞華　胡有成</p>
<p>江善敬　　　　　　陳家球</p>
<p>石金生　鍾勇森</p>
<h3>優游陣綫尚須改進</h3>
<p>江善敬之内衛、梁樹棠之前衛、陳家球之内鋒、鍾勇森之右翼、均爲超人一等之角色、加以優游原具之實力、大可與法商一較上下、顧竟致以八對四大負、此其陣綫佈防、亟須有改進之處、昨中衛綫之崩潰、爲該隊致命之傷、黄瑞華老矣、石金生力不從心、梁樹棠孤立無助、中綫失效、内衛大忙特忙、王才高身當其衝、大失衆望、同時五前鋒之中部主將、未能收手臂相連之効、致事倍功半、優游近年日求進展、似不可漠視此點、以期毋負觀衆之殷望也、</p>
<h3>法商實力異常可異</h3>
<p>法商人才集中、陣綫整齊、前曾戰上海市及香港隊、觀者不以其失利而輕視、且認爲本屆西聯中之强隊、該隊以法商原有人物爲基礎、吸收西捕、葡萄牙、臘克斯三隊名角、混合而成、大可雄視一切、戰勝優遊、在彼輩固在意料之中、由其昨日表演成績而觀、搶跑傳打、無不盡佳、惟左内衛尚美中不足、他日托台登場、則誠無懈可擊矣、</p>
<h3>五分鐘内互有得失</h3>
<p>優游迎日開球、進展不利、門前宣告戒嚴、一球突然出圍、鍾勇森匹馬陷陣、鮑傑斯中計、鍾挑撥合度、碩友迎門一脚、竟告成功、大喜之下、敵兵紛紛入侵、法佛却由右轉中、柯萊脱輕輕一頂、守門顧此失彼、亦告陷落、得之艱苦、失之太易、優游軍心不振、職是故耳、陳家球鍾勇森你來我往、頗有作爲、奈對方守門福祿夀確具功夫、幾次死救、良非易事、彼時聲勢尚盛、中部數將、如果脚下生眼、至少亦可得一二球、</p>
<h3>莫名其妙連失四球</h3>
<p>法商内部旣若金城鐵壁之堅固、前鋒五將、猶如生龍活虎之飛躍、優游乃不得已而作保守之計、王才高處於包圍之中、手足失措、初尚得江梁之助、堅持不下、迨至銳氣一墮、陣綫混亂、鮑休脱單槍匹馬、闖入關中、（二比一）雷米迪遥送一球、王才高收慌意亂、破角而入、法商以三對一領先、從此龍門大開、敵人源源進窺、左翼華特繼中一球、右翼法佛却亦建大功、孫錦順率師反攻、以九牛二虎之力、從敵手中奪來一球、上半時五對二、法商佔先、</p>
<h3>努力周旋挽回乏術</h3>
<p>優游雖負、士氣仍壯、法商反處於被困地位、鍾李二翼、時有貢獻、一次鍾自攻、守門俯身接得、一次挑落門前、胡有成與守門爭奪、李碩友面對空門、乃挑越柱後、孫錦順帶球再攻、由鍾再度傳中、李碩友乃不負衆望、打成三對五、方開笑顔、悲劇又臨、大華特與柯萊脱又互進一球、成三對七、而大將江善敬忽以踝傷出場、挽回希望、完全告絕、梁樹棠大告奮勇、身兼内衛要職、力抗强敵、派克在十五碼處犯規、孫鍾順鐵腿起處、守門得而復失、成四對七、顧轉眼間、柯萊脱又打入一球、造成最後結果八對四、</p>
<h3>中華足球會中字組復旦昨克星光　結果三比零</h3>
<p>中華足球會之中字組、於昨日開賽、首先出馬者爲復旦對星光、復旦人材平均、爲滬上大學隊中之佼佼者、歷年在中華會中頗著戰績、星光亦中庸之材、兩隊競爭、尚有可觀、上半時戒備俱嚴、風波互見、咸能維持過去、復旦由余順章攻入一球、以一比零佔優、下半時復旦球勢仍盛、星光努力招架、並失去機會不少、及後陣容弛懈、又被復旦林炳成李昌熾相繼射中一球、結果復旦以三比零勝、</p>

<h3>新「師說」</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>孔子有當仁不讓之說，師固未盡可尊。孟子有好爲人師之譏，師亦未必可貴。韓愈嘗自謂世無仲尼，不當在弟子之列。其論文說道，則岸然以一代之師自居。然予讀其師說一篇，至謂聞道有先後，術業有專攻。弟子不必不如師，師不必賢於弟子，又未嘗不　其閎論通識也。大戴禮云，「禮有三本，天地者生之本，先祖者類之本，君師者治之本。」至今民間猶有供奉「天地君親師位」者，師之爲人敬重可知。師何以受此敬重？蓋所謂天降下民，作之君，作之師，君師主義爲之也。</p>
<p>吾鄉拳師授徒，往往不盡其技，謂爲「後手拳，」其他百工技藝，師之於其弟子，莫不「留後手。」返觀吾道，亦有師生相忌之事焉。語林云，馬融算渾天不合，召鄭玄，令一算，便决。及玄業成辭歸，融心忌焉。玄亦疑有追者，乃坐橋下，據屐在水上。融果令人追之。旣而告左右曰，玄在土下水上據木，此必死矣。遂罷追。使果有其事，此師忌其弟之一例也。世傳張長史學吳畫不成而爲草書，顔魯公學張草不成而爲眞書，此則弟子忌師之好例也。</p>
<p>魏猛克先生前在自由談發表批評「某社書展」一文，某社旋於自由談欄下廣告内，刊一啓事，意謂猛克不應輕詆其師。鄙意猛克孟晋，容有輕視其師之言；倘刊此啓事者果爲其師，似有嫉忌其弟子之隱。未知猛克復爲謝本師之文，如章太炎之於兪曲園，周作人之於章太炎否也。</p>
<h3>論「包圍」</h3>
<p>— 懷求</p>
<p>小時候在小學裏念書，有一天學校裏特别提早放假，曾不來學校的爹爹忽然來接我，我誠然不是什麽神童，雖則覺得那情勢有些異樣，但並没神經過敏地覺得有什麽嚴重緊張的局面要來的，一看見了爹爹，不免拔脚跑了上去，握着爹爹的手，另一隻手還握着一個皮球。爹爹却不像在家裏那樣和藹地抱我了，拉着我的手往外就走，街上，走的人還是那末的，不過特别地走得快，有些人像是在操跑多，兩旁的舖店都合上了板門，一兩個人探頭探腦的在門縫裏望，我同爹爹，爲什麽舖户都關門了（照例舖店都要晚上才關門的），爹爹也不答我，祇管拉着我走，剛到家，伯伯告訴爸爸：「對河和源嘉河的軍隊都包圍到了」。（那時我們住在河西岸的城市裏，源嘉河是上游）。不一會，劈劈拍拍響起了槍聲，我們在「包圍」中了。</p>
<p>我便這樣學會了包圍，後來在學校裏學着打仗要的時候，便也時常利用這包圍的方法，拿着棍子竹片，俘虜同伴的孩子。</p>
<p>這樣用武力四面八方來包圍，大概是古已有之的，古史我不大記得清楚，三國演義我是熟悉的，劉備周瑜與曹操，似都用過這法子。</p>
<p>用武力來包圍，雖則可操勝算，到底調度人馬，佈置陣勢，很費事的，所以聰明的現代人，又另闢途徑「包圍」去。</p>
<p>很久遠的事且不必徵引，幾年前討伐北方兩位軍閥之役大家總還記得的吧，那時候，北方軍浩浩蕩蕩殺奔而南，南方軍雖兵精糧足，似乎也有點招架不住。那時候，我們的少年將軍還在現在滿洲僞國的瀋陽，靜觀時勢，招架不住的一方，便想請他入關來，實行「包圍」了。無奈少年將軍頗厭勞師動衆，雖則信使往還，動之以利，勸之以義，他總還是懶懶地不起勁兒。到底南方的軍師厲害，看透了信使電報都没有用，便馬上决策派遣代表帶着必需的人物勸駕去，將軍喜歡跳舞，嗎啡，而尤其是喜歡「那末一手」，那次派遣的代表聽說樣樣俱全，色色都有，於是將軍被「包圍」了，於是將軍率衆入關，後面這末一包，於是，北方軍閥解决！這種包圍，當然比硬幹更省事，更經濟。</p>
<p>我們决定對日長期抵抗之後，日本的要人或次要人，西渡來華「遊覽」或「拜訪老友」的頗不少了，最近，南下北上的更很有幾位，他們雖則並没有「全隊」走，然而這次幾個，那次幾個，總數也頗有可觀了，日本素會模倣的，莫不是我們秘傳的包圍法竟被他們學了去，想拿來包圍我們一次嗎？</p>
<h3>突圍</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>（一）凡是動了意氣的爭辯文字，寫的時候總是爽快的，但刊出了之後不免要後悔。我從來没有與人家作過「無謂」或「有謂」的論爭，不幸「自由談」却惹出了我第一篇意氣文字，刊出之後，我就有一點覺得後悔，雖然已近中年，猶恨其少氣未脱。但是一直沉靜到今天，數數剪下來的關於我的文字，從高植先生的「識字與用字」到豐之餘先生的「撲空正誤」，巳有十餘篇之多，黏在一本上，居然可成爲一本「圍剿集」了。我正如被打入文字獄的囚徒，天天在黑暗的獄室裏看報紙上記着的我的罪狀，到今天，我忍不住想越獄了，對於圍剿我的那些文字陣，我有點不甘被圍，所以要突圍而出了。故作「突圍」。</p>
<p>右解題</p>
<p>（二）我在塡寫大晚報徵答表的時候，正在想到我們單字的不夠用，比如我們翻譯外國書，有許多字常常没有辦法，翻翻Ｘ漢字典，往往是「梁上之方木」「窗間之横木」，「溪水緩流貌」這一類的註解，若没有一個適當的中國字譯句就往往累贅了。還有，往往在一段文章中要用到許多同義的形容詞或動詞，字彙不大，就吃了虧。因爲這個動機，以我的愚昧，遂寫下了一部「文選」，我當然認爲「文選」這部書中有許多字或詞可以重新應用在我們的白話文裏，至於那些實在不能復活的字，我承認牠們已經死了。至於「莊子」這一本書，我個人是很歡喜的，用各式的比喻來說出一個意思，青年人要學做最好的說明文眞可以從這部書裏學會一點。以上是我敢於推薦「莊子與文選」的本意，但當然我不能再分開來說以「莊子」爲作文法，而以「文選」爲讀本。</p>
<p>還有，我曾經以「論語」「孟子」「顔氏家訓」這三部介紹給青年人看看，以爲道德的修養。我尋不出一本可以從第一字至末一字完全接受的書來介紹給青年。每一本書都有適宜及不適宜的地方。這三部書，我以爲大體上都還可以看看，尤其是「顔氏家訓」。顔之推這個人見解並不迂腐，也並非高不可攀的道德家，看他的「家訓」總不覺得像看「朱柏廬先生治家格言」那樣的苦澀，所以我也希望青年人看看。</p>
<p>在大晚報上的那個表上，我還塡了兩本書，一本是英文書，「文學批評之原理」，是從心理分析出發的主張實騐批評的李却兹敎授的著作；還有一本是「佛本行經」，一本傳記。這兩種書名塡在「我現在看的書」這一欄内，並非介紹給人的。</p>
<p>右述我的本意</p>
<p>（三）高植先生的文章中說明了四點意見（一）「中學生的字彙少，不一定是識字少……認字多不一定就會用。」（二）我們多認字彙有時是爲着讀古書……不一定要在文章中表現出來。」（三）現在的文章是逐漸地採用外國方法了。（四）與其要中學生讀莊子與文選，不如把這功夫用在思想與觀念的訓練上及新知識的增加上。</p>
<p>對於第一點，我也如此想，但反之，我們當　不能說，「横堅　字多了不一定就會用，所以不必多認字了。」譬如有人，認識百字，須告西字都能　用一二後認百零一字，當無此理。又譬如沈從文先生，博覽典谿，認識四千字，而寫小說，所用不過三千字，高植先生倘不讀沈從文先生所讀之書，而祗讀沈從文先生之書，於是認識三千字，則所用當爲二千字，如何其可也。字彙如此，作文亦然。我所謂青年，係指可以讀「莊子與文選」之青年，並不專指中學生也，若曰中學生，則初中學生，不足語此，高中學生，應當有幾個可以算在内了。</p>
<p>對於第二點，我以爲應當改一改；「我們是讀了古書而字彙大起來的，雖然不一定要在文章中表現出來，但用得着的時候就可以應用了。」</p>
<p>對於第三點，我至今還不大明白，是不是文章採用外國方法之後，連文字都變做洋文了？</p>
<p>對於第四點，我也無話可說，我並没有說青年看了「莊子與文選」就一生吃着不盡，受用無窮，不必更求新知識了。</p>
<p>右答高植先生（未完）</p>
<h3>來函照登</h3>
<p>自由談編者先生：</p>
<p>我因在北平，很不容易看到　貴刊，對於上海文人學士的情形不甚熟悉。比聞友人談起，而且老是談起丨說貴刊有文章，對於拙著在新月四卷六期刊出的評鄭振鐸文學史，有所指敎，甚以不得讀此文爲恨。據說此文内容說我所批評的拙見尚無大悮，惟態度甚不好，世昌不敏，誠闇於自知，不知所謂不好，係指拙文那幾點而說，如蒙該文作者具體指出，並說明比其他書評，不好在何處，或者應當怎樣說法才好，世昌當再拜受敎，這是一層。又據說，某報約則刊說我已向鄭先生投降，御令人始而　然，終乃失笑也。駭然者，駭一人筆鋒之　，於無可挑撥之由，他也能無中生有的挑撥。　笑者，笑其心勞日拙，吃了飯無事可做，我以爲遠不如去外灘散步或者帮脚夫苦力推一下排車，亦是一件好事情。但我想這也不是没有原因的，我應當說明一下，拙稿刊出後，鄭先生卽有一函致新月編者，聲辯五點，其中祗有最後一點的半點有理由，（而這最後一點在拙文中是最不重要一點的五分之一，覆按原文可知）而這聲辯的最後一點，據說是請某敎授代作的。我對這五點都有駁覆，長五千餘字，寄新月編者，無奈新月四卷八期到現在尚未出版，凡在這期有稿子的個個急死，受寃屈者固不僅世昌一人也。鄭先生文學史第一，第三，四各册已出，我也已有長評，本擬送新月，因此也擱下了，我是一個腦筋很單純的人，雖然生長江南，却不曾（也不愛）見過上海那種世面。我假使對某書有意見，就批評，但憑人類共有的理智，他對的我信他，我對的他也應當信我，這其間只有是非，無所謂「面子」「攻擊」「投降」「妥協」一類只有卑汚的腦袋中才有的卑汚名詞。我在北平也聽得許多自以爲十分聰明的謡言，例如某派利用某人攻擊某派等等。嗚呼，假使自己不曾被人利用或者利用過人，豈知天上人間有「利用」這個名詞乎？但我不理那些謡言，於是造作謡言者也就紅着臉冷下去了。其實鄭先生在燕京是敎授，我是學生。我們天天見面，有時一起吃飯，他以後有書我若有意見，仍可互相批評，找着眞理，不妨互相承認，「投降」「妥協」云者，我讀了十幾年書，尚未讀着這類名詞也，是那位先生送給我的，我在這裏長揖奉還。此函若蒙　編者先生刊出，我的感激是無可言喻的。　祝福　吳世昌上</p>
<h3>兩兄弟　（十二）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>公證人勒卡魯先生接着說道：</p>
<p>「我在巴黎的同業已把他那遺囑裡面的主要條欵通告我了，他在那條裡載明以你的兒子哲安，羅蘭哲安先生，爲他全部財産的繼承人。」</p>
<p>大家聽着這話驚異到什麽話都說不出來。</p>
<p>羅蘭太太最先抑住了自己的感動，吃吃的說道：</p>
<p>「天啊，這可憐的雷恩……我們的可憐的朋友啊……天啊……天啊……死了！……」</p>
<p>她的眼睛裡現出了眼涙，女人們靜靜的淌着的眼淚，這種流在頰上現得那般沉痛而又那般晶瑩的，從靈魂裡發出來的悲哀的點滴。</p>
<p>但羅蘭老爹一心貫注在那繼承遺産的喜訊上面，老友的死亡倒不在乎。可是他不敢卽刻詢問遺囑的條欵和財産的數目；爲要達到這有關係的問題，他繞着圈子問道：</p>
<p>「他是害什麽病死的，這可憐的瑪賴沙？」</p>
<p>這事勒卡魯先生完全不知道。他說道：</p>
<p>「我祇知道死者没有直接繼承人，他把所有的財産！每年有兩萬佛郎左右的利金附着百分之三的債務！全都留給你的第二個兒子，他說這是他看着出生，長大，並且認爲適於接受這筆遺贈的人。如果哲安先生不願收納時，這筆遺産將捐給育嬰堂裡的棄兒。」羅蘭老爹再也不能藏住他的快樂了，他呌道：</p>
<p>「好呀！這眞是一種好心思。我，如果我是没有後裔的話，我也决不會忘記把我的財産遺贈給這位正直的朋友！」</p>
<p>公證人微笑着說道：</p>
<p>「我早就狠高興地想着要親自來報告你們這事。把一個好消息帶給人家，這總是一樁快事啊，」</p>
<p>他毫没有想到這個好消息是一個朋友的死訊，是羅蘭老爹的一個最好的朋友的死訊，而羅蘭自己也狠快地忘記了他剛才那樣確切地叙述出來的親密的交情。</p>
<p>祇有羅蘭太太和她的兩個孩子保持着悲戚的容顔。她仍在微泣着，用手帕　着眼睛，隨後再把手帕擱在嘴上，壓住那沉重的歎息。</p>
<p>醫生輕輕地說道：</p>
<p>「這是一位正直的，非常慈和的人。他常常請我們吃飯，我和我的弟弟。」</p>
<p>哲安兩眼睜得狠大，且神彩弈弈，他以一種熟練的手勢，把他那美麗的金黄色的鬍鬚握在右手裏面，一直摸到最長的幾根的尖上，好像要把它們拉長並弄薄似的。（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花紗花漲勢有連續性</h3>
<p>紗市晨漲午跌、形勢尚堅、以上月某會收進棉紗有二萬五六千包之巨、紗布倉庫中之存紗三分之二、被其購去矣、因此有一部份人心激動而漲、但環境仍顯良好、新多者仍無十分興趣、且標紗價抬過現人鐘秒價二元有强、</p>

<h3>美總統重提物價激起棉市反動</h3>
<p>紐約二十七日電報告一週中之棉市云、上週中羅斯福大總統之重行注意提高物價、及訂立金市之宣言、頗激起棉市之反動、但所有需要、均爲套賣、及多頭了結而補足、故週末市况、稍形回下、業中人於提高金價後、對物價之水平綫、影響殊起衝突、每磅一角之押欵、在南方業已實行、聞其基礎頗穩、雖有若干農人簽字、頗抱疑慮也、據聞棉花契約在今年毁棄棉田、而由政府付給租費、將於下週中支配矣、印度原棉與日本貨物之交换頗爲人注意、同時美俄復交一事、將使美棉增一輸出之源、亦極令人注目也、</p>
<h3>糧食　遠月粉稍形回好</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先穩後疲之象、以洋麥報價芝加哥回漲一元一角左右、坎拿大漲一二角、故初開時、人心尚穩、後因實銷客帮陸續回出、天津現貨開價、卽呈平疲、前次交易所限制賣方、前日已公告市面、回復原狀、如是廠家方面、又得抛賣之便利、有此原因、故洋麥雖報漲、市氣又反轉寂、較之前日、計小一分左右、迨至下午開盤、本月份因回籠棧單、數量甚多、市形甚軟、遠期則因多行又頻頻收進、致氣象復振、惟交易不多、不過小回頭而已、結果十十一月份各小五厘、十二月份大七厘半、一月份大一分半、二三月份大一分、</p>
<h3>麥市步呈穩象</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、大致呈平穩之象、以洋麥報價回漲、故開價後、人心雖未十分振動、惟因市上之現貨籌碼、逐步减少、洋麥似不能卽到、且以本月份情形而言、（實在交割約三十餘車）市面雖已終了、但臨了之回振、因有廠家之吸收、業内外之觀瞻、大致如是、市氣遂步呈穩象也、結果十一·十二月份各好一分、一月份好二分、二月份好三分、三月份好二分、現麥仍見穩挺、開蚌埠小麥三元九角半、姜堰麥三元八角六七分、高郵麥三元八角五分、蕪湖麥三元五角七分、由福新去五千包、阜豐去一千包云、</p>
<p>本月份標麥現貨交割共計四十五車、一號收去三十車、其餘均係零星囤套收入也、</p>
<h3>窰種百哥續高角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源三十餘號、貨約四千餘石、平疲市况、似已轉機、初市開手本街店胃頗見栗落、客帮納意亦濃、而到貨又復較稀、是以形勢殊俏但究以久疲之後、人心尚難堅穩、故至午市又軟、結果大局仍定中帶緊之象、僅有數分上落耳、統計窰中百哥六中包胃續辦一千二三百包、行情略高角許、一切花色新粳本胃去路亦有二三千石、其價跟起近尺、杜洋尖步上數分、銷化約有二千餘石、破粳僅五六百石、平定而已、隂變元無甚軒輊、惟變元酒户帮已有動動、開價爲八元三角、</p>
<p>（滬北）河下各路到貨二十六·七號、市銷仍呆、市形新粳羊杜尖略現緊勢、窰種貨稀價加近角、百哥價小角許、白元隂元價小二角、破粳客尖仍屬穩定之象、</p>
<h3>福州帮繼續辦裝客秈</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、因閩帮進辦、貨主堅擯、形居呆擯之局、後有一部份福州帮到市辦裝、市面稍見活潑、行情則仍平站之勢、泉州帮有洋米到埠、巳無意再辦客秈、故昨始終未有問訊、本街及浙路粤省均無問津、統市計開出湖南機靖一百包、價七元一角半、又砶靖七百包、價六元四角至六元三角半、次五元九角半、　沙市機秈一百五十包、價六元半、南京糙米一百六十四包、價五元三角、統爲福州辦去、</p>
<h3>芝蔴去路尚見活絡</h3>
<p>芝蔴趨勢頗堅、其中關貨比較高貨售價占優、因紹榨油市須採價宜之貨、昨市辦去三百四十餘包、均係中檔貨、九江黑蔴漲而復跌、原因來源稍積、此種花色貨胃銷不大之故、昨由前帮採去三十包、價開八元三角、汕頭帮成交六十包、價八元二角半、</p>
<h3>南北貨　四川榨菜軋缺猛漲</h3>
<p>四川榨菜、近以來源無繼、存底軋缺、客貨開價突然猛漲、高貨曾開至三十元、比前升起六元、價盤因亦隨升、高貨呌售三十元、次至二十六·七元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　美匯劇變影響絲價</h3>
<p>（紐約絲價猛跌角餘）　美國自提高物價之政策宣布後、美匯逐步回縮、紐約生絲市價每磅步漲一角五六分、（美金）詎至前日匯市忽起劇烈之反響、滙價暴跌、絲價亦隨之而猛跌、每磅計跌美金一角餘、已回復未漲前之原價、查紐約此次絲價之忽漲忽跌、純係滙價關係、絲銷依然呆滯（川黄絲又到六十件）　昨江順輪船進口、又由漢口裝到川黄絲六十件、由葆太和等提回貨棧存儲、</p>
<p>（人造絲銷續呈清平）　昨本埠人造絲市續呈清平、祗長江帮進雙星紅綠金鐘等牌十一月份期貨二十八箱、價自一百七十二元五角至一百七十元七角半凈盤、</p>
<p>（滬埠絲銷又告停滯）　海外絲價連日因滙票關係、均告步漲、詎前日美匯暴升、紐約絲價一日間猛跌三十餘元、（華幣每包價）惟英倫里昻尚能立住、滬埠各美莊聞此匯變、均不敢冒險進行、市氣停滯、昨祇有上午半日市面、現絲均無成交、絲銷前途、一時尚難捉摸、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉略有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之珍眉綠茶、法莊略有走銷、保昌福時等行買進二百四十餘箱、婺源北路高莊貨、售價自一百十六元至一百二十九元、屯溪貨售價自九十元至一百零五元、其餘針眉秀眉等項、均無大宗交易、至紅茶因近來英倫銷路呆滯、市盤趨跌、完全無人問及云、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油浙西産新已近</h3>
<p>柏油新貨已將登場、從事斯業者、咸注重於新油之買賣、滬上隣近浙省、而尤與浙西嘉興一帶産區密邇、故歷年新油到滬最早者、當首推嘉興之本車油、因該處小雪前後、均已開榨、一經見新、本埠可朝發夜至、若以往年而衡、則此時抛盤期貨、早有交易、但製燭用塲、淘家係備年貨之用、以隂歷而論、現尚在九月初旬籌備年貨距離尚遥、所以燭商態度頗爲從容、然以時令而計、則桕子巳屆成熟、産區榨坊均忙忙於收子榨油、聞浙西年令尚佳、陳油適已售罄、繼續新貨、不致中斷、照浙路情形、新油似難過廉、且紹興榨坊家已在嘉興一帶收買抛盤桕子、價格大概每石市斛在五元五六角之間、以此計算桕油成本恐在二十元以上、現本埠行家評價祇在二十元以内、因漢市荆麻等油、陳貨尚夥、致市面步疲、申市本以漢市馬首是瞻、職是之故、與浙路未能接近、而浙西榨坊家因子尚未收、亦不敢貿然廉價抛油、致連日市場上新貨市面反而寂靜、總之今庚開榨較早、而原料之桕子各家必須多備、則子價恐不易望廉、而油數産額反較往年增加、則油價反不易　好、將來生貨與熟貨恐成背道而馳、亦未可知、若果如是、則各榨坊之營業、殊不容易應付也、本埠行家底積已薄、惟銷極零落、大概成　待新貨之發展、貨價重荆仍在每砠二十二元光景、平荆二十一元三四角、麻城十九元五六角、漢市表面雖定、内容極慘、市場上頗呈不景氣、</p>
<h3>五金　蛋廠帮動辦馬口鐵</h3>
<p>以外國蛋白業銷路之不佳、致本埠專配蛋廠帮購銷之一種、Ｐrime牌、美馬口鐵亦萎靡不振、是以專做蛋廠帮之同業、頗以爲苦也、近三四日來、聞蛋廠帮已呈活動之勢、致本埠一蹶不振之馬口鐵市面、亦有欣欣向榮之勢、其價每箱售三十八元五角、聞昨日已開出六七百箱之多、</p>

<h3>新人鑰</h3>
<p>— 基爵</p>
<p>記得那一年在某敎會大學參觀開學典禮，其中有一個節目是大學二年級的級長授「新人鑰」與一年級生的代表，節目非常莊重緊張。所謂「鑰」，竟是一把長鑰，而「新人」二字却完全從英文Ｆreshman直譯來，鑰上刻着「入德之門」四個字，意思是說給大學一年級新生入德之鑰，可以有一年的保存，一年後便轉交下班一年級新生，新舊循遞，這個節目因此也就沿襲至今。</p>
<p>爲了一羣剛從有秩序束縛的中學出來而甫踏進繁複的大學門檻的學生，没有明白大學生活的奥妙，未盡了解智識寳庫的尋找，故授與這一把啟奥發蒙的金鑰，俾不致茫無頭緒的亂闖，希望他們向着「入德之門」走去：一年走過了，有没有走進「入德之門」還是一個問題，但這把神秘的鑰子又得傳給下一班的學生。下一班的學生更復遵命地「依樣畫葫蘆」。</p>
<p>社會上的事物每是如此的演變。先進之輩恒能懇切的囑咐後輩努力，指示他們處世做人的方法：後輩並没有依照他的囑咐做去，把先進遺留下的一切至理名言完全抛在一邊，暢所欲爲，弄得人欲横流，社會愈加紛擾，結果是把先輩遺言原封傳給後人，仍然也是呌他們學好，可是事實又未必如此！中山先生致力革命四十年，深知「革命尚未成功」，諄諄以「同志仍須努力」囑咐後人，後中山先生而死的人又必抱歉着說丨革命未成身先死……努力呀！同志……</p>
<p>丨但我希望着這不與「新人鑰」的故事相提並論。</p>
<h3>禮拜一的早晨</h3>
<p>— 淑英</p>
<p>號房間牆上的時鐘正指着八點，門房阿福在用油印機印講義，這時抬頭看一看鐘，便欲向門外走去，忽又似有所悟，停往脚步，回轉身，仍舊繼續他的工作。</p>
<p>上課下課，按時打鐘，這是門房的責任，如果遲誤了是要被駡的，尤其是下課鐘，可是每逢星期一第一課照例是做紀念週，這要等校長到了才舉行的，所以打鐘就不能和平日一樣呆板了。</p>
<p>一小方塊四面圍着高牆的操場上，已普照着陽光，空氣比較的温暖多了。同學們除在寢室裏的，大家都集中在這裏。有的在打球，有的在做絨線生活，也有拿着書本看的，最多數是在談話：</p>
<p>「你昨天怎樣玩玩？」Ｃ女士問和伊同站着的幾個同學。</p>
<p>「我們三個人在南京大戲院看影戲，你呢？」</p>
<p>「昨天我家裏客人很多，白天就在家裏混過去了。晚上Ｂ約我去跳舞。我覺得跳舞更有意思些。」</p>
<p>「自然啦！可是我們住在校裏是没有這福氣的，而且也没有你這樣出風頭，也没有人陪我們去。」</p>
<p>「不要取笑了，可是住在校裏也不妨去呢。昨天我看見校長和Ｔ先生也在那裏，他們去的時候已十一點多了，我恐怕彼此都要拘束：便先走了，實在還没有盡興呢！」</p>
<p>小妹妹Ｄ這時把手錶舉起來一看：</p>
<p>「啊呀！要死的，已經九點半鐘了，到底要等到幾時呀！恐怕他昨夜跳到天亮，現在還在睡覺呢，」</p>
<p>管他呢，在這裏多晒一會太陽還不好嗎？</p>
<p>「對啦，我覺上課也没有什麽意思呢，這些敎員眞是蹩脚透頂了，Ａ女士頗有點自負。</p>
<p>「鐺！鐺。鐺！阿福把鐘打得震天價響，於是空氣頓時緊張起來。大家都陸續地走到禮堂裏去，一刹時已坐滿一堂。先是全體肅立，行禮，唱歌，待到主席恭讀總理遺囑的時候，校長出現在台上，面對遺像，朗讀遺囑。讀完了便俯首靜默，從後影看去，樣子十分虔誠。</p>
<p>「報告」這聲音一發出來，校長先生便回過身來笑容可掬的向大家略一點頭，開始報告了，大意是：「國難如此嚴重，日本人如此欺侮我們，希望同學們都負起救國的責任來：」接着便是訓育主任，敎務主任，事務主任接二連三的報告校務訓話等等，大家都聽得不耐煩起來，談話的聲音四起，絨線生活也公然拿出來做了。</p>
<p>時間一分一分地過去，台上終於空着了，於是散會了。</p>
<p>阿福眞是太巴結，人家剛走到敎室裏，又在打上課鐘了。</p>
<p>黄先生一走進敎室門，大家都喊起來：</p>
<p>「咦！第三課都快下了，怎麽還上等第二課？」</p>
<p>「你們敎員不要上！」</p>
<p>「明天再上好了，明天也有的，今天已經過了」</p>
<p>黄先生似乎還不肯走，正在相持不下的時候，國文俞老先生來了。</p>
<p>「對不住！對不住」！老先生向黄先生打着照呼說。</p>
<p>「不要客氣！」黄先生拿了書往外便走！</p>
<p>於是鬨堂大笑起來。</p>
<p>國文先生是最好講話的，所以笑聲繼續到很久，點名的時候没有被一個人聽到。</p>
<h3>大學宿舍速寫</h3>
<p>— 羅村人</p>
<p>同房間的一共三個人：老張，老王，老李。</p>
<p>老張今天到房間的皮鞋聲，很遠的就聽見，特别急促而有力：他才到房間，就呼的一聲把那到了大考才指定幾章看看的講義摔到桌上，講義頭上巳縱横凌亂的寫滿女生的名字與批評，那是上課的時候與鄰座老趙討論的成績。</p>
<p>這時，老王的情書剛剛寫了。再没有工作可做：很要問問老張的消息。</p>
<p>老張，今天在課堂上和小周Ｍake　eyes吧」？</p>
<p>「怎麽不，我告訴你，伊也像有點意思了，前幾天伊是不回頭向我看的呀」。</p>
<p>老張說過後，又歡喜，又有點覺到難爲情；他要掩蔽這難爲情，索性和老王開心了，他笑着。忽然的摟抱着老王，狂呌一聲：</p>
<p>「妹妹，我愛你呀」。</p>
<p>那知聲音太大，驚醒了正在午睡的老李，老李在這白天做的夢，是誰也猜不到的，雖然驚醒他的夢，可是老李並不生氣，因爲討論的題目，旣不像國事之無聊；也不像學術之生硬。他聽完老張報告今天課堂上的情訴之後，大爲興奮，有樂人之所樂之概。</p>
<p>「對啦，老張，」老李大聲的對老張講，隨後又建議老張：</p>
<p>「第一步，你隔幾天去向伊借筆記，這事旣大方，又不唐突」。</p>
<p>「然後呢」？老張急得没命。</p>
<p>第二步，老李又說，我們不是馬上要開系會嗎？我們活動你們倆一道兒做委員好了」。</p>
<p>「對呀，有委（尾）才好相交呢」。老王笑，老李也笑，老張更笑，三個人的笑聲把一個房間變成處處蛙的池塘。</p>
<p>哈哈哈！</p>
<h3>校外宿舍的危險</h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>上海的土地，房租的價值，委實太貴了於是有許多的學校，不能多建宿舍，容納學生們的寄宿：就有一部份的學生，只好自行到學校附近去租賃宿舍。但在上海地方專供學生界居住的公寓式建築，目下尚屬少數，那麽就不得不同普通人家合住，而種種危險的事情，亦就從此而發生了。</p>
<p>常聽得朋友們說：「這是什麽緣故？有許多青年子弟們到上海去讀書，結果就弄到「回不得家鄉」「見不得爹娘」…………」我起初也想不出爲什麽？現在覺得以下所說的，也許是一種原因，是一種事實。</p>
<p>在ＸＸ校外宿舍裏面，有一部份的學生，他們現在的舉動，我不敢武斷地說他們將來一定要墮落，但這種舉動，確實足以引導青年們走到墮落之路上而去，那是很可斷言的。</p>
<p>义麻雀，打撲克，……這些都是社會上面最劣的消遣品，這是誰多承認的；但現在他們幾個學生非但不能去勸導人們的改善，反而津津有味地自己去做，每天的晚上，總可以聽得他們房中的打牌聲，骰子聲，星期日更甚，一切的一切，他們對於這些賭博的工作，委實興致太高了。</p>
<p>賭博的目的，無非拿金錢來作輸贏，但是學生們的金錢有限，萬一金錢用完了，恐怕在那時候，種種危險的舉動，就要不知不覺地産生了呢！</p>
<p>當此國難期間，學生們的責任是什麽？什麽事應該做？什麽事不應該做。我想很聰明的學生們，一定能夠醒悟；但是現在這些學生，他們太被惡習慣蒙蔽了，非有大勇，恐怕跑不出萬惡的危險窟罷！</p>
<p>唉！罪惡！ＸＸ校外宿舍。</p>
<h3>兩位地理敎師</h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>最近聽到兩位地理敎師對於中國地理敎學上的主張，絕對不同，而他們是己非人，相爭得可笑又可痛。</p>
<p>甲說：我敎學生中國地理，自塘沽恊定簽字後，絕對不講東北四省，因爲這四省已不是我們所有的了，政府雖喊着長期抵抗，實際是長期斷送；抗日英雄口說繼續奮鬥，實際已長期休養；攘外安内，變做和外安内，這淪陷的四省，决没有收回之望，所以一提到他，就覺無限傷心，猶之失掉了一件寳物，珠還無望，越想越傷悲，而傷也無益，悲也没有用。我們現在所要注意的，那是未失之地所有山川形勢，而積人口，物産交通，政治工商敎育等等，都要使學生認識清楚，知其與人生之關係，引起他們愛護此錦繡河山之念，不忍再失去尺土寸地。也猶之未失之寳物，取出來一一指示兒孫，言其功用價值，呌他們永遠保守，永遠流傳，毋再有失，這樣豈不是比較徒傷巳失之地而實際無力收回來得好些？所以我的不講東北四省，正所以謀保未失之地。</p>
<p>乙說：從前講東北四省，尚可簡略馬虎，現在則更須講得道地。四省之面積人口，鐵路河流，高粱大荳，森林礦産，獸皮羊毛，高山平原，荒地熟地，以及此四省與全國之關係等等，都要使學生更熟悉，更認識，而生失之痛惜之念，以堅其收復由我之决心。猶之一件寳物之失去，愈想愈覺其可愛，愈想設法收回，而焦心苦慮，久而久之，自能珠還合浦了。東北四省，政府不想收回，難道我們不好呌今後之學生來收復嗎？所以我講東北四省，今重於昔，正所以備收復失土，而亦所以保全全國也。</p>
<p>失掉的國土可不去讀它，豈不可笑？又豈不可痛？未失之前講得馬虎簡略，已經失掉了，始知十分注意，不也是一樣的可笑可痛嗎？</p>

<h3>看哪！我們的農村現狀</h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>不久以前，記者接到一位朋友從浙江硤石的鄉間給我一封信、信裏面對於中國農村經濟的破産情形，有這樣一段的描寫：</p>
<p>「農村經濟的破産和農民困苦生活的一般狀况，在這裏親眼見到了。賦税的有寺無减，農産物一般價格的低落，廣汛的農民對於現狀都在自覺中喊出許多含有潛意識的怨聲來，這些聲音可以在内河的小航船上，茶館店内，田間桑下諸　塲會上，都很容易不由你發問而能聽到同樣的議論，咒駡和抗聲丨丨雖然是很散漫的在無組織狀態之下！」</p>
<p>接着在他信的最後面又有一段老農的話，那就更可發人深省而啓示給我們理解這以農立國的中華民族丨牠的危機與改進的方向了：</p>
<p>「昨天有一個老農這樣回答我一段話，我覺得這裏涵着很嚴重的意味，他說：「我們有着的田地，現在並没有一塊賣掉，我們的生活（指工作）一直來也不曾偷過懶，可是這年頭，好像田是没了，辛苦是白吃了，窮也就這樣莫名其妙地窮了！」末了，他又這樣含糊的，自怨自艾的補充說：「可是我們是始終不相信是自己做窮了的呀！」這是一個自耕農，破産狀况尚且如此，那末，其他一般僱農的慘况，就更可想見了。這裏的田價，在二年前每畝可值百元的，現在四十元也無人問津了。」</p>
<p>這種怨聲，還是僅限於江浙一部份的富庶農村，至於安徽，湖北，河南，陜西，甘肅，四川等省的一般農村經濟破産情形，則更爲顯著。據最近紅卍字會上海總辦事處，接到在皖北的振務專員來函報告，皖北的頴阜太和一帶的農村毁壞，悍匪遍地的情形，眞是令人驚詫不置。據謂近數年來皖北各地，因農村經濟日就衰落，於是老弱者坐以待斃，少壯者多挺而走險，入於爲土匪之途。此次頴阜一帶被匪焚掠者達二十五鎭之多，綁去的人票，有八千餘名，在南照集撕去一千餘人，在太和舊縣集撕去三千餘人。所贖者有限，因贖票之人，一到匪境，其股非一，到此股則必被檢查，若携欵即搜去，不問其贖票與否也。錢被搜去，遂哭訴於彼股，彼股反認爲誑言，或將耳割去，或將手截去，仍放其回來籌欵，限期不到，即遭殺戮。凡小孩以八歳者作一串，九歳十歳者作一串，十餘歳者作一串，均用蔴繩聯貫，在後用鞭扑之，號啕跳行，匪以爲樂。這種慘象，不要說是身臨目睹，單是聽聽，已足使人不忍想像的了！而我們尤應知道的，就是所謂頴阜太和等處，在十年前尚是皖北一帶最富庶的農産地，頴阜（阜陽）即舊頴州府城。太和離阜陽約百餘里，均爲沿淮河支流之頴河的大城鎭，離蚌埠約五百餘里。十年前，英美商人，在這一帶地方，每年都要收買一百餘萬元的農産品，如鷄蛋，猪，牛等物，由頴河運到蚌埠裝津浦火車轉上長江輪船來滬出口，當時該處的繁榮是可想而知，誰料到十年後的現在，竟會弄成這一步田地呢？</p>
<p>再看四川罷！據新近自四川來的人說：「該省農村荒廢現狀，實多出人想像之外。其主要原因，則爲幾年來川省各軍閥混戰不巳，加以旱魃爲災，四川北部之田賦，竟有徵收到民國二百六十年份，即預徵至二百四十年之後，至川南，川東，川西各部，雖則尚未到此程度，但至少亦徵至民國六七十年，即四五十年以後矣！因此民衆亦皆視務正業者爲愚人，衆耽賭博，所有公園與娛樂塲，皆代之以賭博場！」</p>
<p>我們聽到内地各省整個農村崩潰的趨勢，看着上海表面上一切畸形發展的情形，除非我們不用腦子去想，否則我們相信不必等帝國主義來親自動手，這老大的中華民國行將自己送上門去，請人家來共管瓜分！不相信麽？看哪！近來各方面所表現的一切一切，有那一件不是向這條路上走去呢？</p>
<p>一個社會的進步以至整個民族的復興，是要靠各方面各種力量的奮鬥，不斷的前進，方能收效。我們看目前的種種，除了少數人自以爲是的在那裏盲動亂動，大言不慚的騙人外，有什麽是顯示着這種奮鬥的力量呢？這整個社會已入於毫無生氣的形態之下了！這是事實所給予我們的感觸，可不是什麽悲觀不悲觀的問題。</p>

<h3>觀潮前眼睛的操練</h3>
<p>— 沙舍郎</p>
<p>廠工……小職員</p>
<p>「咳！」這麽一聲，知道又是他來了。我急忙把那幾頁賬單從抽屜中拿到桌上，只預備瞧他的臉色就得啦。同時，心兒跳着。</p>
<p>「算好了没有？」他發問了，帶着不耐煩的神色跟着强硬的語氣。</p>
<p>我就站起來把那幾頁賬單遞給他，回話到喉嚨口又咽下啦。</p>
<p>「六·七·八！咦，我要瞧九月份的賬啊。」</p>
<p>「先生，九月份的還没結出呢。」</p>
<p>「怎麽！還没結出，你辦事眞眞……眞眞………」</p>
<p>他，眼珠子隔着三百度的「蔡司」玻璃彈起着，差點兒會滾出來的。一絲浮薄的笑，在鼻子那兒，多難堪的神色哪。可是我却裝着端整，站着候他的下文……</p>
<p>「幹麽不快結呢？你難道不知道經理在催總賬嗎？經理丨丨你得明白。你可别吊我的脚。」</p>
<p>「是！先生，九月份的存貨賬本來也結好咧，爲着銅匠間頭兒那張機件表還没對清送來……」</p>
<p>「不，討厭。我不管你銅匠頭兒不頭兒，我只問你要九月份的賬啊。」</p>
<p>「是……是……先生，但是要是没有那機件表，有好多東西的價目就没處查考呢。」</p>
<p>「照你說來，那麽便一輩子不結了？幹麽不去催？」</p>
<p>「是……是，但，我巳經去催過了。銅匠頭兒說總賬到月底纔送交經理呢。……」</p>
<p>這時，我心兒裏像有一百匹小鹿在奔跳着，背脊上像有千萬支針在刺着，眼前的空氣是窒塞的。他又嚴重地說了：「你懂什麽？多纏，你去坐我的位子吧。你們這夥年輕人不服從上級的命令，就最可惡。老實對你說，服從上級是不會錯的。」</p>
<p>他不輕不重地用手在我桌子上扔了一下，一半表示出他的怒意，而一半却似乎是表示出他的話是絕對的。</p>
<p>「是，是，是……」我不敢再往下說啦。偷瞧着他的還没有潟下去的眼珠子</p>
<p>「不，你不能呆在這兒，我等你九月份的賬。」</p>
<p>總算凑巧，銅匠頭兒把機件表送來了。</p>

<h3>論德國退出國聯</h3>
<p>— 趙嫺靜女士</p>
<p>許多人對於這次德國希特拉的退出國聯，表示着無限的同情與欽仰，以爲這是被壓迫民族反抗國際帝國主義聯合壓迫之最具體的表現。如果問題眞的如此簡單，那末，不久以前日本的退盟，不也是反抗帝國主義的表現了嗎？無論什麽國家的退出國聯，當然是對於國聯表示不滿及國聯不能賦予某種權利有以致之，决不是全無目的的；因此而認定某個國家的擺脱國聯的束縛即是反抗帝國主義，思想上的愚蠢將是多麽可笑！</p>
<p>倘然這次退出國聯的是中國，那才是值得欣喜的反抗帝國主義的行動，因爲中國所處的是殖民地的地位。但是，德國，牠與中國不同，而且相反。大戰以前，德意志是帝國主義的覇王，大戰以後，雖然他居於戰敗國的地位而遭受戰勝國的壓迫，被束縛在凡爾賽條約之下轉輾呻吟，然而從牠國内外的政治經濟諸關係上看過去，無疑的牠仍然是個帝國主義國家。而希特拉的上臺，更是德國走向帝國主義頂點的明證。所以這次希特拉因不能達到他軍備平等的要求而退出國際，正是帝國主義者相互間矛盾之不可調和的表示，那裏是德意志民族的反帝行動？</p>
<p>不錯，德國國社黨的外表，簡言之，就是極端的民族主義，國家至上主義。他的政治目的，對外是澈底發揮軍國主義的精神，反對凡爾賽和約；對内是痛惡馬克思主義，否定階級鬭爭。所以他在未得政權以前的口號，是建設大德意志，取消凡爾賽和約，反對社會主義的黨派。趁着經濟恐慌的日益加深，政治的不安定，工農羣衆思想的左傾的這種混亂的局勢，希特拉即以最迅速的手段奪得政權，坐上了德意志統治的寳座。但是，他是十分明白的，處在目前這樣局勢之下，拒絕各帝國主義的提携而單獨統治德國和鎭壓「反動」是不可能的。尤其國社黨自身的矛盾，力量的脆弱，使他在掌握政權以後的第一天，即向國際帝國主義表示軟化，說：「新内閣與全世界保持和平的友誼關係。」而本來是國社黨主要政綱之一的「廢除凡爾賽和約」，也不聲不響地改爲「修改凡爾賽和約」。至於他那復興德意志的四年計劃呢，直到現在，也仍然是一張不兌現的支票。凡此種種都足以使德國人民對於希特拉的信仰一天天的動摇。所以，希特拉爲想延長他統治的壽命，就趁這軍縮會議再開的機會，提出軍備平等的要求，要求不遂，繼之以退盟，想以對外問題去轉移國内反對的視綫。可是，希特拉僅僅向國聯發出了一道退盟通知，實際上的束縛猶未解除，他即得意忘形地在凱爾漢姆地方樹立了一個所謂「解放紀念碑」，並當衆演說：德國唯一的目的僅在謀求幸福，酷愛和平，所以現在除安心工作而外，别無他求！可知這次希特拉的退出國聯，並非站在極端的民族主義立塲上來復興德國，他只是代表高等德人或德國帝國主義者向其他帝國主義者表示屈服或無抵抗而已。</p>
<p>慌張　情緒，手撥在算盤珠上也變得怪不活絡地。别扭兒的，算五遍就算出五個總數來。腦子給威嚴的監視累夠啦，自家兒相信，平常我的算法没這樣壞。</p>
<p>「糟，你的算法，嘻，你的算法。」這些嘲笑就夠我難挨啦。只恨眼前没個地潭。四脚像發了麻痺症。再也不敢抬頭正視他一眼了。</p>
<p>原是，現社會上就獨多這種人丨丨不肯給予他人「指導」和「互助」，而却把「輕蔑」和「嘲笑」算作他們的拿手戲的人呵。</p>
<p>要不是爲了生活的話，我决計會逃掉的。</p>
<p>九月份的賬終於在他的監視下結算了。臨走時，他像譏刺我似的笑了笑說：「朋友，我今兒纔知道你的本領不錯呢。」</p>
<p>留給我的，只有無窮盡的「難堪」。</p>
<p>沉默了半個鐘點的和我同地位的下級　員們，又竊竊私語起來啦：「催得這麽急，還不是自家兒想告假去看潮！」</p>
<p>可是，我這纔認識了上級職員的威嚴。</p>
<h3>小資本經營小工廠的方法</h3>
<p>— 本</p>
<p>在資本主義社會大資本吞併小資本的法則下，小資本經營小工廠，本來是很困難的，特别是中國的社會，外受國際帝國主義的壓迫，内受連年不斷的天災人禍的襲擊，使銷賣市塲日益縮小，再加以大資本的侵蝕，便更增一層的困難。然倘使經營得法，我　想也未必不能得到相當的成功吧。兹述本人的經騐以及觀察所得於下，以供儲有小資本而有志經營小工廠者作參考。</p>
<p>（一）選擇大資本不屑經營而又適合於環境和需要者經營之。若此等工業找不到，則應擇原料比較便宜者經營之。</p>
<p>（二）獲得銷售市塲的秘訣。應减低價格，改良物品，因價格减低，到銷路；物　故良，則購者多。</p>
<p>（三）應用省時間與省手續之機器。此等機器雖價錢比較昻貴，但可以减少工人，增加生産</p>
<p>（四）工廠開辦後，製造貨物所需資本的大小，視製造品暢銷的遲速而定。若能增進暢銷速度，則自能减少資本之需，而獲得較大的利潤</p>
<p>（五）待遇工人不要太苛，因爲太苛則工人不滿；工人不滿則出品不良與遲慢。須知小工廠與大工廠競爭最主要的長所，是在資方與勞方和氣合作。</p>
<p>（六）應設法使同行的工廠或商店，彼此交换意見與内容，勿彼此嚴守秘密，互相摧殘。</p>
<p>（七）用人應純視才幹與能力，一切情面薦託須從嚴杜絕。</p>
<p>（八）工業的研究與試騐，應進行無怠，庶製造品得隨時改良。</p>
<p>（九）應聯合同業作廣告宣傳。</p>
<p>（十）節省浮費。</p>
<p>上面所述，自然僅是幾點較大的原則；然倘若能依照這些原則而加進各人的環境地位做去，則就使得不到怎樣大的成功，但無論如何也必不致於完全失敗吧！</p>

<h3>英國勞動兒童的星期敎育</h3>
<p>— 李培英</p>
<p>在基督敎的國家裏，人們在禮拜日是多半穿上清潔的衣服，脱却了平常勞苦的面孔，而快活地去散步的，這自然是說的那些中上階級以上的職業人，而在勞動者是没有法子可以享受的，因爲他們不能不爲了生活去工作，無分什麽禮拜的。由於勞動者没有功夫去敎育他們的子女，於是敎會就來替他們服務了，尤其是在那些所謂文明國家裏的勞動兒童，他們每禮拜都得進敎堂裏去作祈禱。這是由於兒童們和他們的父兄們喜歡宗敎的信仰的麽？不！這完全是因爲兒童們到敎堂裏去可以得到一頓豐盛的午餐和中午的一些休息。</p>
<p>在德國，照兒童保護法令是禁止十歳以下的兒童參加勞動的，但是根據一九三○年沙克生的調查，五二九三○三個學校兒童中，有三四三○三個兒童是勞動者；同樣，在撒爾非爾特地方，有百分之二十的學校兒童是從事於一定的勞動的。</p>
<p>據最近的調查，柏林的小學生中有七八九五個是從事違反法令的勞動的，照上課時間，每天有四小時勞動的兒童有六三三個，六小時的有一一九個，還有一一五三個就是禮拜天也不能完全休息的。這些兒童不單是得不到較好的營養，甚至連衣服都没有的，尤其是在希特拉獨裁以後，兒童們差不多和他們的父母一樣，是完全墮入黑暗的地獄裏了。</p>
<p>這種兒童地獄的現象，在英國也是一樣。英國的勞動兒童除了每禮拜到敎會裏去吃一頓飯和休息以外，還要唱讚美歌，述說天父的故事，讀敎士所講述的聖經。可是，因爲勞動者兒童們對於這些並不感到什麽興趣，於是敎會又設立了一些唱歌隊或運動隊來吸引他們。這</p>

<h3>烏拉爾機器製造廠</h3>
<p>— 郭秀夫</p>
<p>十月革命後的蘇聯爲了使本來是資本主義最落後的農業國家，變成超過資本主義工業國家的社會主義國家；進行了有名的五年經濟計劃。爲了把國民經濟底一切部門都轉移到最新的技術基礎上丨社會主義的機器工業底基礎，電氣化底技術基礎；在第一次五年計劃的實施期内，建造了農業機器製造廠及世界聞名的但尼伯水電廠。而在第二個五年計劃中，重工業方面在第一年執行期中最大收獲之一，就是完成了斯浮達洛司克城的烏拉爾機器製造廠。這廠的規模是非常的宏大，共分七個廠，即機器廠，鐵料製造廠，修理廠，白鐵鑄造廠，銅料鑄造廠，工具廠，及模型廠，而每個廠又分許多部門。這廠主要的出産品是輾輪機及熔鐵爐等等。熔鐵爐是非常龐大的機器，這種機器本來祗有英美德三國纔有的，但因爲受了資本主義的經濟恐慌的影響，英國的二百七十五架，美國的二百五十架和德國的一百架熔鐵爐，都相繼停工了，而蘇聯，在第一個五年計劃中，却建造了二百七十五架的熔鐵爐。</p>
<p>在這廠裏，有四十六種壁報（多數是日報），一千二百三十四個工人通訊員。稿件都是關於工作的努力前進的。在廣泛的通訊網下丨丨從機器廠的辦事處伸張到各廠及各部門，公共食堂及店舖等，都爲着更多的出産，更好的質品，改善伙食，日用品供需，清潔與衛生而奮鬥着。</p>
<p>短小精悍的壁報，在「爲建造烏拉爾熔鐵爐廠」的口號下，對這機器製造廠作了很大的帮助。報上充滿了牠的通訊員許多生動的，活潑的來稿，反映出工作上的困難，勝利，工人與專門家的向上性等。他們一致贊掦着烏拉爾機器製造廠的男女英雄們，把社會主義英雄們的照片貼在報上，又鼓勵其他的男女工人，爲着社會主義建設的英雄而奮鬥。此外報上還經常的登載着工人們對於工作上的心得，經騐等，以供其他的工人作參考。</p>
<p>隨着工廠的生長和發展，許多從鄉村裏來的男孩子和女孩子，都受了新社會文化的，經濟的和政治的洗禮，都變成了熟練的工人，技術師及組織者。</p>
<p>工人的生活水凖，也在提高着。斯浮達洛司克城雖然有個很好的戲院，但對於烏拉爾機器製造廠的工人是很不方便的。所以，現在又建造了一個足以容納六萬人的文化中心區。其中有電影院，俱樂部，馬戲塲，圖書館及文化與休息公園。許多的學校已在建造了，又組成了十九個幼稚園。此外並建築了一萬二千三百立方公尺的工人宿舍。都有一個管理員，專門管理宿舍内一　房屋的修理，租議房屋，以及清潔衛生等事務。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>樣，直至後來，社會主義日曜學校（SocialistSunday　School簡稱ＳＳＳ）開始建立時，敎會敎育始遭受相當的打擊，因爲他們是敎會敎育的反對者。</p>
<p>社會主義日曜學校或ＳＳＳ是帶有自由主義的色彩，他們一方面反對敎會，一方面反對反社會主義的黨派，而同時又没有和社會主義者發生聯系。現在，他們在全英國境内巳有六四二○個學生，一○九個學校，無疑的，牠是在發展着。</p>
<p>他們對於宗敎的態度是怎麽樣呢？ＳＳＳ的書記長曾經說過下面的話：</p>
<p>「……有神呢，還是没有神呢？我們不是知道的。所以我們没有權利把我們所不知道的事情敎育兒童。所以，我們關於彼岸的事情是没有敎育的；所敎育兒童的，是和他們原則一致的生活，也就是像在成人後用什麽方法去爲社會主義努力似的敎育。……」</p>
<p>ＳＳＳ旣拒絕了敎會的敎條，那末他們用什麽東西來做他們的信仰呢？這是很有趣味的，他們也用十原則來代替敎會的十誡，也規定着每禮拜日兒童應該朗誦的。在十原則中有兩條是值得提出來的，卽：</p>
<p>「爲了要發見眞理，必須觀察思考，不要相信在理性上衝突的東西，不可欺騙自己，也不要欺騙他人。」</p>
<p>「我們是以……正義爲基礎，……要援助創造新的社會！」</p>
<p>這直截了當地可以說ＳＳＳ的敎育，並不是獨斷的呌兒童埋頭在社會主義的理論上，而是要使他們由於自身的觀察和認識來正確地理解一切的。</p>
<p>關於ＳＳＳ運動的原則，有許多固很是正確，但也有許多是陷入於很深的人道主義泥淖中的。例如，ＳＳＳ某一次會議上有着這樣的意見：</p>
<p>「愛是比較憎惡來得强有力些。而且一個人想要握别個人的手，是比較在輕蔑裏面伸出手去來得强有力些。世界裏面最强有力的東西，就是人有敬畏的地方。所以，人就要敬畏母親，父親，小孩子，朋友的同情和相互愛。母親，父親，小孩子，朋友的同情和相互愛就是最後强有力的勝利。」</p>
<p>這理論，不僅是違反了ＳＳＳ的十原則，而且有創立一種新宗敎的危途。這理論顯然是不正確的，因爲兒童的「愛」的觀念可以說是先天的，這觀念的培養是在於社會的環境，如果不積極的改造社會環境，而單是提倡唯心的「愛」，是没有用的。在這資本主義社會制度之下，所謂「博愛」不過是一種空洞好聽的名詞；事實上帝國主義是决不會愛弱小民族，壓榨者也决不會愛被壓榨者的，因此，我們雖欲愛我們的敵人，不去憎惡他們，而於理於勢也都有所不能！</p>
<p>業餘藝術</p>
<h3>「音樂救國問題」</h3>
<p>— 史如愚</p>
<p>九一八之後，一般「救國」的主張，有「抵貨救國」，「航空救國」，「敎育救國」，「馬達救國」，「奬券救國」等等，其他還有什麽「跳舞救國」，「内戰救國」，簡直是多得不勝枚舉。現在又有人在主張拿「音樂」來救國了。但歸納起來說一句，他們底初衷都是愛國的。有一位先生丨主張「音樂救國」的！他這樣的說：『暮氣沉沉的民族，是需要怎樣的强力針去挽救呢？老實說，只有「音樂」才可救中國。』接下去又說：『的確，我們深切地感到頽廢不振的中國，的確是缺乏了藝術的灌輸。』是的，我們承認，中國的確是缺乏着藝術的灌輸，尤其是「音樂」的常識更加幼稚。但是中國的民族所以弄到這個暮氣沉沉，頽廢不振的地步，却不是僅僅爲了缺乏藝術的灌輸，還有着更大的原因在，例如「忍辱負重」……等等名詞的擔用之類。現在，我想把關於「音樂救國」的意見，提出幾點來和大家討論討論。</p>
<p>每一種藝術的滋生和發展都是有着牠社會底背景的。譬如歐美各國是資本主義最發達的國家，加之科學昌明，物質的享受達於極點，所以他們底藝術當然是進步的。可是，進步儘管進步，而其爲少數有閒的人的享樂物則仍是無可否認的。至於殖民地的中國呢，那更是不必說了，連年都在天災人禍外侮内戰中輾轉掙扎着，大多數人生活尚不能安定，那裏還能顧到什麽飢不能食寒不能衣的藝術呢？眞的，我們要把眼光放遠一些，看看歐美各國民族之所以如此活潑莊嚴，究竟是什麽道理？是因爲他們的音樂特别發達的緣故嗎？我說，這是因爲他們的生活比較的優裕安定，所以活潑，富人在窮人的眼光中看起來總是莊嚴的。可是，把眼光再放遠些吧，由於資本主義發展到極點的結果，使全世界大鬧不景氣，使窮人一天天的多起來，情形與前早巳大不相同了。</p>
<p>說起藝術的創造，第一條件便是充分餘裕的時間，次爲經濟的力量。請看中國四億民衆之中，有幾個是不愁吃不愁穿和有着充分經濟能力的？那只有有錢人家的幾位公子小姐而已。可是，她們或他們，終日價只是藏在象牙之塔裏，不問世事，唯我獨樂，她們或他們那裏知道東北有多少萬的亡國奴在那裏受帝國主義者的宰割，以及大水災大旱災吞吃了多少的蒼生？但有時，碰碰高興，在閒得難過的時候，也想找點機會來出出風頭。記得前幾個月便有人打着藝術救國的旗號，開什麽繪畫展覽會，然而，結果，畫是賣去了不少，國却並没有得救。事實擺在眼前，日本帝國主義者在東北的地位一天天地堅固了起來，最　又在　　　　的心思了。這那裏還是該昔樂的時候？</p>
<p>音樂救國的主張者說，西洋的凡亞鈴和披亞那都是由中國的樂器脱胎而來的，我們好摹仿而缺乏創造力的民族性使我們離棄了國樂，摹仿洋樂，到現在，音樂（連同其他諸藝術）已成爲一部分人的消遣品。然而本國的便宜樂器，又何嘗不是一部分有閒階級所有的？根本一個爲生活壓迫有人，他就不會化錢買樂器，而且也没有時間去研究音樂。</p>
<p>我們要知道，成羣的青年男女們的苦悶，决非僅僅是因爲缺少了音樂的安慰和刺激，滿街的無線電和留聲機不是在那裏傳送着各式各樣的歌曲嗎？我們正有着不少的强力針呢！然而在一大羣失了業的苦孩子們，一聽到了這種靡靡的商音，便更要增加他們底煩惱和觸動他們底感傷，因爲他們内心的創傷只有工作和麵包才能醫好。那末，也許只有像法國馬賽革命曲那種音樂才能感動他們底冰心嗎？然而法國大多數民衆所缺少的却是麵包而並不是音樂。</p>

<h3>貧民小工車肉屏風</h3>
<p>— 章成亮</p>
<p>從Ｓ埠開往Ｎ城的第ＸＸ次列車。没有頭等，没有二等，連通常的三等都没有。是青灰色，貼滿煤灰，從没洗刷過一次的『貧民小工車』丨那麽一長列，扮着隂黯的臉，懶洋洋地靠着第Ｘ號月台。月台上激動着洶湧的人潮。</p>
<p>機頭不願意似地在前面儘喘着氣，鼻子朝天，心坎裏火熱啦，血液在奔騰。它會拔起腿兒跑掉的，只要誰在它腦杓上揍一鞭。揍一鞭，一鞭，一鞭………媽的！你瞧那路警。他們站在票櫃那兒，没頭没腦亂捧着人。</p>
<p>『他媽的，買票眞受氣，挨鞭子。票櫃上那傢伙更神氣啦，不收小銀毫兒，硬向人要大洋錢找，還不是想揩油！一元三角半，給了兩塊大洋只找六個小銀毫兒。哼！欺侮窮人算不了好漢子』</p>
<p>『囉囌什麽着？「化錢受氣」是有這句話兒的，要坐他的總没法。』</p>
<p>月台長得要命，車子也長得要命，人像潮水般湧着。瘦黄的臉，光秃和有着長亂髮的腦袋，没一件完好的衣褂，没一些歡躍的情緒，孩子伏在骯髒的女人的背上，哭呌着要着被擠在前邊的爹。爹却扔着臉兒回過腦袋來駡女人：『這麽斯文地！上勁擠啊，没瞧見嗎？車上人擠滿了。』</p>
<p>擠滿了，向機頭那邊跑去，也没一節比較空些的。黑壓壓的腦袋兒，在車窗口不安靜的晃動着。一股股燒鴨氣味，一陣陣遮没陽光的濃烟。</p>
<p>『就上這節車吧！』</p>
<p>車梯像有意和人爲難般的没一些兒灣勢。吊住那根鐵槓攀上去，一不小心便會滑落車底下去的，瞧那些單身女娘兒就夠苦啦！帶孩子更危險丨丨這就是『貧民小工車』。</p>
<p>『貧民小工車』，你還没見過車廂裏的情况哩。腥臭的氣息充溢着。没穿襪子的爛得血淋淋的腿。生着外症，淌着膿液有腦袋。愁苦的没表情的男女的臉，給一層煤烟濛住了，給喧鬧的談吐濛住了，在這裏，大夥兒是從都市裏受着生活鐵刺的創傷而被驅逐出來的人哪。歡欣的情緒没有，希望的種子没有，更没有舒暢的空氣，一切，都深深地陷在悲苦的深潭。</p>
<p>可是，從車窗望到都市的街景，仍是歡騰的。</p>
<p>四條狹隘的硬板凳上，有着四座肉屏風。那些後來找不到座位的老婆子，女人和小孩，就在地上坐下了，腿撞着腦袋，腦袋靠着腿，茅厠間裏亦擠着四五個，有幾個年輕的爬上行李架去啦，再這樣擠下去，准會把車廂擠破了的。</p>
<p>『索性把車廂擠破了，也好讓咱們透一口氣。』</p>
<p>你知道的，一節貧民小工車上没開幾個窗洞，讓隂暗陪伴着鬱塞的空氣。一些傳染的病菌在鬱塞的空氣裏散播着。劣等烟捲兒的氣息散漫着。坐過監獄的人，是不會在這裏發生痛苦的反感的</p>
<p>『喂！送死嗎？猪玀！』路警把那個吊在車梯上想解褲小便的老頭兒揍了鞭子，又恨恨地駡上這句時，車巳經蠕蠕地開走啦。</p>

<p>業餘咖啡座</p>
<h3>「業」而無「餘」的「業餘」</h3>
<p>— 丘進賢</p>
<p>近來「業餘」兩個字，風行一時。因爲「業餘」的風行一時，於是乎應運而生了許多美妙的名詞，如「業餘補習」啦，「業餘運動」啦，「業餘娛樂」啦，不勝枚舉，於是乎任何人似乎都可以把業餘的時間，充分地利用到有益於身心的事情上去。但是，就在這上面，却發生了一些小小的問題：第一，我們該先明瞭，每一個從業員是否都有「業餘」可供利用？就以上海一隅而論，除了機關，洋行，新式商店的「從業員」之外，根本就没有所謂「業餘」，而没有「業餘」的從業員，恐怕要佔到全埠從業員的百分之七十以上。此輩没有「業餘」的從業員，恰恰又都是智識饑荒者。他們的工作與生活，以店員而論，大抵都是從早上七點鐘，一直工作到晚上九點鐘或十點鐘。在這十二三小時的工作時間之内，除了吃飯的那一些時可以安坐一刻外（如果没有顧客上門的話），最好是一天到晚的手足不停。即使没有顧客上門，也得用鷄毛帚東拭西拂，以示勤謹，免得資方請你「另圖高就」。所以，就是要拉屎，也得趕緊些兒，更莫說可以捧着書報而研讀。待到九十點鐘，上了排門，早巳疲勞得不知所云，便實行其「業餘睡覺」，誰還有這精神去從事於「補習」，「運動」，「娛樂」，………呢？</p>
<p>再以工人而論，其生活更不如店員。黎明六點鐘進廠，對吃人的機器奮鬥到晚上六點鐘或七點鐘，埀頭喪氣地回家，還得「埋鍋造飯」，塡修五臟廟。留着明天帶進廠去的冷飯，而把殘餘的塡飽了半個肚子，於是剥下骯髒到不知所云而滿含着機器油味的衣服，用力地洗刷一番。這麽地把工作幹完了，自然可算是「業餘」了，可是若再挨延一會兒去幹些「補習」，「運動」，「娛樂」，………明天凖會廠裏拉着回聲，你還在打着鼾，而失了一天的工作，而挨着一天的餓。</p>
<p>所以，所謂「業餘」，還是從業員的中間層以上者，才有亨受的權利。越是迫切需要利用業餘時間以增進智識與健康的下層從業員，便只有站在地獄底裏，仰着脖子，期待着老板們在西天出太陽的時候，自動地起而改良他們治下的小夥友小工人們的不合理的待遇。</p>
<p>現在再來研究一下有享受「業餘」權利的中間層以上的從業員。即以我個人而論，每天的工作時間，雖然只有上午九時至十二時，下午二時至五時之間的六個鐘頭，但是清早起來，得看顧孩子，讓老婆去買小菜，午飯後，又得管孩子，讓老婆整理東西，下午公畢之後，又得管孩子，讓老婆洗衣服。吃過了晚飯，還得寫一些文稿，换幾個錢，貼補家用。自然，我的生活是不能做一般人的代表的，但是，無疑地，必有不少與我同層的從業員，同我過着同樣的生活，丨丨雖然有「業餘」的時間，但是實際上是没有機會把牠利用到鍜鍊身心的事情上去的。</p>
<p>從此，我們可以找到一個結論，「業餘」的一切運動，舊式商店的店員，出賣勞力的工人，雖有業餘的時間而爲窮與家累所困者，都是無福享受的。實際上能充分地把業餘的時間，利用到「業餘ＸＸ」上去的，最低的限度還是小資産階級裏的人們，以及小資産階級裏的人們的子女。</p>
<p>在畸形的社會經濟組織下面，自然免不了這種畸形的産物。但是文化是依着時代的巨輪而進展的，我總盼望着，在不久的將來，這個世界上不再有一個是「業餘」的向隅者。</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Arrives in Nanjing for Financial Discussions with Wang Jingwei; Special Plane Dispatched to Invite Kong Xiangxi to Nanjing; Returns to Jiangxi in a Few Days to Supervise Communist Suppression; Central Political Council to Convene Emergency Meeting Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived at Ming Palace Airport at 1:15 AM on the 28th, flying from Nanchang in a Ford aircraft piloted by American Smith. After Soong Tzu-wen expressed his intention to resign due to the difficulty in financial planning, and at a time when military affairs were tense and military expenses urgently needed Soong's planning, Chiang Kai-shek specially dispatched Soong Mei-ling to Shanghai on the 26th to earnestly persuade him to stay. However, Soong Tzu-wen felt that the central government's finances had reached a difficult situation and could not be maintained without thoroughly implementing the new budget, so his intention to leave had not completely disappeared. Soong Mei-ling flew back to Nanchang at 6:00 PM on the 27th to report the results of her trip to Shanghai. Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling then decided to return to Nanjing to discuss solutions with Wang Jingwei in person. Before Chiang Kai-shek left, he telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission and the Lixingshe, instructing their personnel not to go to welcome him. Therefore, those who went to welcome him on the 28th were only Tang Shengzhi, Chen Yi, He Yaozu, Zhu Peide, Zhou Yawei, Chen Hui, Huang Musong, Xiong Bin, and Kong Xiangxi's four sons and daughters. In order to avoid public attention, the Military Affairs Commission changed its plan and sent 30 security guards to guard the scene, and all military police were withdrawn. Chiang and his wife got off the plane, accompanied by one attendant, Wang Shihe. Chiang wore a gray robe, black mandarin jacket, and a blue cloak, looking energetic, but his complexion was thinner than before. After Chiang got off the plane, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel and then took a No. 4 black car with Kong Xiangxi's sons and daughters to Kong's residence outside Zhongshan Gate for lunch and a short rest. He also ordered the Ford aircraft to fly to Shanghai immediately to pick up Kong Xiangxi, the president of the Central Bank, to Nanjing. After refueling, the plane flew to Shanghai at 1:40 AM. Kong Xiangxi responded to Chiang's invitation and flew to Nanjing at 3:30 PM on the 28th. Due to strong winds and rain along the way, he did not arrive at the airport until 5:30 PM. The 28th happened to be the third day of the Central Military Academy's exercise in Luyuan. After Chiang, his wife, and Kong's sons and daughters visited the mausoleum, they reviewed the exercise for an hour. The original plan was to give a lecture, but it was not carried out due to the fatigue of the flight. After resting at the official residence, Chiang took the No. 4 car to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways at 4:30 PM to meet with Premier Wang. The meeting lasted a long time, and he did not leave until 7:00 PM. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang's associates said that Chiang would not be able to stay in Nanjing for long because the military situation in Jiangxi Province was progressing. After Finance Minister Soong arrives in Nanjing for a meeting, he will fly to Jiangxi within a few days to preside over everything. Zeng Zhongming said that Premier Wang did not need to leave Nanjing for the time being due to the busy government affairs in Nanjing. Finance Minister Soong had been urged to come to Nanjing by a joint telegram from Chiang and Wang, and may arrive here on the 29th. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi came to Nanjing on the 28th in the afternoon from Shanghai on the Ford aircraft sent by Chiang to pick him up, to meet with Chiang to discuss important matters. He arrived in Nanjing at 5:30 PM, accompanied only by his wife, Ms. Soong Ai-ling. President Liu of the Central Bank and Kong's sons and daughters were all at the scene to welcome him. Kong returned to his private residence to rest immediately after getting off the plane. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing by plane from Jiangxi on the 28th, he went to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways to visit Premier Wang to discuss important matters. The results of the discussion will be submitted to the Central Political Council for discussion before a concrete decision is made. The Central Political Council will convene an emergency meeting on the 29th, and the notification was sent out on the evening of the 28th. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Meets with Mongolian Dignitaries in Zhangjiakou; Inquires About the Truth of Autonomy and the Situation in Inner Mongolia; Departs Zhangjiakou for Suiyuan Today or Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Pilian, and their entourage arrived in Zhangjiakou at about 10:00 PM last night. Zhang Weifan, Zhao Botao, Guo Zhihan, and others all went to the station to welcome them. The Mongolian princes of Chahar Province, including Prince Zhuo and Prince Suo, also sent representatives to Zhangjiakou. Huang and Zhao got off the train in Zhangjiakou and planned to exchange views with the Chahar Provincial Government and Mongolian princes. After staying for one or two days, they will go to Datong, Suiyuan, and contact the Jin-Sui authorities. Wu Heling passed through Zhangjiakou last night and went straight to Suiyuan and then to Bailingmiao to make preliminary contacts and prepare vehicles for Huang, Zhao, and others to enter Mongolia. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: After Prince Zhuo hosted a banquet for Huang on the 28th at noon, Huang met with Selengnamjil, the chief of the Chahar Right Wing Pasture and director of the Third Model Livestock Breeding Farm; Dali, the acting chief of the three banners; Nima Otter Sol, the general manager of the Gangyai cattle and sheep herds and acting director of the Mungan Military Pasture of the Ministry of Military Affairs; and Damilin Zhapu, a counselor of the Chahar Provincial Government, and more than ten officials from the twelve leagues and banners of Chahar. After the officials stated their opinions on Inner Mongolian autonomy, Huang explained in detail the central government's intentions and his own inspection mission. Huang is scheduled to leave Zhangjiakou on the 29th or 30th to meet with Yan in Datong. It is undecided whether he will proceed directly to Suiyuan to meet with Fu Zuoyi. Everything will be reported to Yan through Fu. At the beginning of the month, he will go to Bailingmiao by car. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian are scheduled to summon Prince Zhuotegongzhaobu at 9:00 AM this morning to inquire about the truth of Inner Mongolian autonomy. At 11:00 AM, they will meet with Temerbule and others, the chiefs of the northern Chahar and the twelve banners of the Zala Shan Banner, to inquire in detail about the local situation in Inner Mongolia. Li Shoushan and others, representatives of Zhangjia to Mongolia, telegraphed to Beiping that they would arrive in Bailingmiao soon. Zhangjia is now appointed by the central government as the Xuanhua Envoy and is also a political official, and should bear political responsibility. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government is building 120 Tianci (heavenly shrines) at its office location, which are being sent by various leagues and banners to the government seat for installation. The first year's budget for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government is 320,000 yuan, which will be shared by various leagues and banners. The first half of the year will raise 160,000 yuan, and the second half of the year will be adjusted depending on the complexity of government affairs, as decided by the Legislative Committee. The security guards of the autonomous government will be selected from the flag soldiers sent by various leagues and banners, totaling 1,000 soldiers, to form the government's guard team. The Tianci at the government seat is about 500 li north of Guihua, in the center of the Sizi tribal banner between the Ulanqab League and the Xilingol League, with beautiful scenery. The main government personnel include Prince Yun, who was elected as the chairman; the two league leaders of Suo and A, who were elected as the vice chairmen; Prince De, who was appointed as the director of the Political Affairs Department; and Prince Dongdagong, who was appointed as the chairman of the Legislative Committee; and the deputy leader of the Ulanqab League, who was appointed as the director of the Examination and Discussion Department. If Inner Mongolian autonomy is implemented, the annual tax revenue could reach 8 million yuan, and Suiyuan's finances will feel panicked. Therefore, the local authorities cannot sit idly by and the future is worrying. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Suiyuan News: Luo Sang Yijia, the chief of staff of the Panchen Lama, came to Suiyuan on the 25th and visited Fu Zuoyi and Shi Huayan, the director of land reclamation.

<h3>The Hebei Security Force Launches General Offensive Against Bandits; Qiuying, Nanwangzhuang, and Xiwangzhuang Are Also Recovered; Zhang Xiguang's Negotiations in Yu County Fail</h3>
<p>Changli: The bandits suppressing bandits were surrounded by our security forces for many days and had no ability to resist. At 1:00 PM on the 27th, they suddenly fired more than 100 mortar shells at our positions, but we did not suffer any losses. At 1:00 AM on the 28th, Zhang Xiguang ordered a general offensive from all directions. Dou Xizhe's troops began to set off at 3:00 AM, implementing a dawn attack. Shen Longtian, the commander of the first battalion under Dou, Liu Peng, the commander of the second battalion, and Wu Cunxian, the commander of the third battalion, led their troops to bravely attack. The first battalion attacked from the west of the city across the Yanghe River, the second battalion crossed the river from Xiwangzhuang, and the third battalion crossed the river from Xiangying, attacking Zijingshan and Fu City. At that time, it was still late at night, taking advantage of the bandits' lack of defense, the Liu and Wu battalions first attacked Zihua Mountain, and after a battle with the bandits, they occupied Zijingshan and the South Gate of Fu City at 6:00 AM. The bandits fled back into the city, and our security forces immediately pursued and attacked, successively recovering Qiuying, Nanwangzhuang, and Xiwangzhuang. The bandits outside the city were completely driven into the city. Zhou Yuying's troops were also ordered to advance to the line of Daxiao Gangzhuang and Baiguoshu. Zhang Xiguang ordered all roads to advance slowly, build fortifications quickly, and prevent the bandits from counterattacking. In this battle, 50 to 60 bandits were killed, and our police team lost 2 and injured 14. Gu Enlin, the commander of the ninth company, was wounded by artillery fire in Qiuying. In order to quickly recover Fu City, Zhang Xiguang offered a reward of 5,000 yuan for the recovery of Fu City and 1,000 yuan for the recovery of Zijingshan. The troops' morale was very high, and the recovery of Funing was imminent. Liu Zuozhou's troops are still stationed in Daxiao Liguan Ying, north of Fu. Also, Zhang Xiguang's meeting with Yuanteng in Yu County on the 27th did not yield satisfactory results. The General Headquarters moved from Qinhuangdao to Changli to work on the 28th. The Japanese garrison chief Yinghe Wu came to Changli to visit Zhang and inquire about the situation at the front. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xiguang went to Yuguan on the 27th to contact the Japanese military staff officer Yuanteng, but no results were achieved. A Japanese company opened to Funing City, siding with the bandits, which hindered our bandit suppression plan. The Political Affairs Committee sent Liu Shisun to Tianjin on the morning of the 28th to ask the Japanese Commander Nakamura not to interfere in the bandit suppression issue. Nakamura said that this was an incident of the Kwantung Army, and the garrison was not in a position to intervene. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the bandits in Funing were attacked by our security forces, the gangs of Qi Wenping and Hu Yutian were scattered and fled. Those who are currently entrenched in the city are still Zhang Kuiyuan, also known as Lao Haozi, with about 600 to 700 troops. When Funing was besieged by our security forces and was in danger, Zhang once fled alone to a certain place for assistance. A certain party has agreed to provide protection. After Zhang Fei received a definite reply, he heard that he had sneaked back to Funing to resist stubbornly. On the one hand, a certain party requested our authorities to incorporate the troops. There are no traces of bandits within ten miles along the railway line from Tangshan to Yuguan on the Beining Road. The trains run smoothly and the order is quiet. In order to prevent the bandits from Funing and other places from running to Qinhuangdao and other places to cause chaos, the Yuguan garrison sent a team of Japanese troops every day to patrol and protect the area between Yuguan and Tangshan on a special train. The special train had seven first- and second-class cars. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Returns North After Visiting Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Kemin, the director of the Financial Department of the Beiping Political Consolidation Council, went south to visit Finance Minister Song Ziwen to discuss the finances of North China. Wang Kemin has agreed that all military and political expenses in North China will be planned and allocated by the central government. This trip has yielded considerable results. He came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 28th to visit Wang Jingwei, and after asking for instructions, he crossed the river in the evening and returned north by car to report back. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Sets a Deadline for the Recapture of Suiding; Offers a Reward of 100,000 Yuan for Xu Xiangqian's Head; Wang and Fan's Divisions Take Charge of the Front Line; Fierce Fighting with the Bandits at Dashiqiao</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Xiang ordered Wang Lingji and Fan Shaozeng's two divisions to take charge of the front line of bandit suppression. Since the 26th, they have been fighting fiercely with the bandits at Dashiqiao, and the fighting has not stopped on the 28th. Tian and Deng's troops have also been dispatched, and the bandits are now showing signs of retreating north. Liu Xiang has set a deadline for the recapture of Suiding and offered a reward of 100,000 yuan for Xu Xiangqian's head. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang returned to Chongqing. After the rear deployment is completed, he will go to Suining to supervise the army. Wang Lingji is stationed in Liangshan, and Liu Cunhou went to Liang to discuss a counterattack. Yang Sen's troops are advancing from Peng'an Yingshan and have contacted the bandit army. He Long, the bandit leader in western Hubei, planned to flee north and contacted Xu Xiangqian to attack, but was cut off by Xu Yuanquan and Chen Mingqian's troops. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Telegraphed to Beijing to Report the Resolution of Fang Ji's Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Fang Ji's troops were resolved, the military affairs in North China only await the suppression of the remaining bandits in eastern Luanhe before they can be completely concluded. He Yingqin sent a detailed telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Premier Wang on the 27th, reporting the process of disbanding Fang Ji's troops, as well as the efforts of Shang Zhen and Wan Fulin's troops, and has returned to the original defense. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Denies Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations; Claims That the Boycott of Japanese Goods Is Gradually Disappearing</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, Japanese Ambassador Arima emphatically denied to foreign reporters that he is currently engaged in negotiations with the Chinese authorities, and stated that Japan does not advocate direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, but is willing to resolve various issues between China and Japan separately. The envoy said that the negotiations between China and Japan are currently being handled by Huang Fu and the Kwantung Army, and are progressing smoothly. There are many issues under discussion, including postal services between "Manchukuo" and Yuguan, the establishment of customs along the Great Wall, and the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops into Manchuria. He believed that the current government in Beiping is more stable than before. The envoy continued to discuss other parts of China and paid particular attention to the situation in Jiangxi, saying that if Chiang Kai-shek obtained sufficient military expenses, he would be able to defeat the communists. If the Red Army penetrated into the Yangtze River basin, the current government would be seriously affected. He especially hoped that Chiang would be victorious. The envoy continued that Japan does not pay attention to the Mongolian autonomy movement, but Puyi may use his power among the Mongols. The Mongols may be invaded by Russia in the north and by "Manchukuo" in the southeast, and their situation is also very difficult. When asked by reporters whether Japan would mobilize troops in Rehe to defend the northwestern border if Mongolian autonomy succeeded, the envoy replied that he was afraid that this would not happen. The envoy continued that compared to the current situation with when he was in Beiping a year ago, the general situation has indeed improved. The movement to boycott Japanese goods is gradually disappearing, and the rejection of Japan in several places no longer exists. Sino-Japanese trade is currently improving. The envoy also mentioned the American cotton and wheat loan, saying that if Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai do not purchase the large quantities of American cotton currently imported into China, the Chinese will not be able to absorb it all, and Japanese merchants have not been able to purchase it at the current price. (Reuters telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Representatives of the creditor group to China, including Okubo Toshikata, the manager of Yokohama Shokin Bank, and Uchida Katsuji, the executive director of Toa Kogyo, visited Foreign Minister Hirota this afternoon, requesting the promotion of the resumption of negotiations on the settlement of debts to China. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that at a time when China has declared a pro-Japanese tendency, this is a good opportunity to test its sincerity, and it is imperative to quickly return to the track of resuming negotiations, promising to take appropriate measures. It is rumored that Foreign Minister Hirota will order Ambassador Arima or Consul General Hidaka in Nanjing to make a proposal to the National Government within days. (Dentsu telegram on the 28th)</p>

<h3>The Urgent Need to Build a Bridge Across the Qiantang River: May the Zhejiang Authorities Do Their Utmost to Achieve It</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Since the revolutionary administration, the country has been in turmoil, with frequent wars and successive famines. Local administration has largely fallen into a state of stagnation. However, Zhejiang Province, with its relatively favorable situation and less severe suffering, and with enlightened officials presiding over provincial affairs, has shown signs of progress in its construction over the years. Anyone who has set foot in Zhejiang and observed its municipal facilities can generally give a favorable review. Like the sound of footsteps in an empty mountain, it brings a sudden joy, also showing the people's eagerness for governance and their deep hunger and thirst, easily satisfied by food and drink.</p>
<p>Of the construction projects in Zhejiang Province that are evident to the people, transportation is the most prominent. The people have truly benefited from it. The addition of highway branch lines and the establishment of light railways have already taken shape in a considerable period of time. And the recent proposal by the Construction Department to build a bridge across the Qiantang River can be called a far-sighted and outstanding plan. All people in Zhejiang almost unanimously hope and ardently desire that the authorities complete this once-in-a-millennium grand vision.</p>
<p>Regarding the need for the Qiantang River Bridge, the average person knows that it is only for the convenience of transportation. If we extend it further, it can greatly revitalize industry, and also maintain public security to a small extent. Moreover, it can bring unexpected gains to the efficiency of general administration. Although the benefits are limited to one province, the impact can spread throughout the country. I will now explain each point one by one.</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang has always been known as a wealthy area, with abundant products. However, due to inconvenient transportation, it often becomes congested. Since the construction of highways and railways, it has become more convenient than before. However, the separation by the Qiantang River has not made it easy for large quantities of products to flow into western Zhejiang. After the bridge is completed, eastern and western Zhejiang will become one, and sales will increase, and production will double. This directly increases the wealth of the local area, and indirectly increases the supply of other provinces. This is one aspect of revitalizing industry. Transportation across the Qiantang River has always relied on voluntary ferries. Boats are scarce and simple. Whenever there are storms, they are delayed. Since the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the Xiaoshan-Shaoxing automobile route have been connected, the number of passengers crossing the river has suddenly increased. The river surface is vast, and it takes time to travel back and forth. Those who want to reach the other shore early will inevitably compete to be the first. As a result, some have lost their footing and fallen into the water, and some have started quarrels due to crowding. Moreover, thieves take the opportunity to move around, and unscrupulous people take the opportunity to extort money, which makes passengers feel unable to cope with the suffering. If a bridge can be built, the journey will be smooth and unobstructed, and all evils will be eliminated. This is the second aspect of maintaining public security. In recent times, people in various places often have doubts about administrative officials and lack trust. The reason is that tax levies have been repeated for many years, but the local construction industry has not been able to have a real display. As a result, a general dissatisfaction has arisen. Even law-abiding and public-spirited people often have no way to gain the understanding of the majority. Such separation of officials and people is a regrettable thing in terms of administrative perception. Now that there is such a great and magnificent building emerging in front of them, at least it can make the people recognize that the so-called administrative officials are also willing to seek practical benefits for us. Establishing a foundation for cooperation between officials and people, dispelling the past doubts of the masses, this is the third aspect of promoting administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Knowing the above points, then the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge is urgently needed. We now dare to sincerely tell the Zhejiang authorities: At this time when the people are looking forward to it, you should have a firm and indomitable will to pursue a rapid catch-up. Even if the current difficulties need to be carefully planned, the future reputation can be passed on forever. In the future, when people from eastern and western Zhejiang cross this bridge and find it convenient, how can they forget the difficulties of your construction today? Is it not your pioneering efforts that have inspired other provinces to rise up and embark on the path of construction? The term of your service as officials in Zhejiang will eventually come to an end, but the good policies that can be used by later generations to remember you will never end. Do you know where to find peace? Moreover, there is another saying: Once this matter is started, it must be done with all efforts. Do not be negligent and take shortcuts, do not delay and miss the time. Abandon the lofty claims and rely on practicality. If we can see the realization of this new building in a short period of time, our humble people will sincerely pray and wish for it.</p>

<p>Palestinian National Conflict</p>
<h3>Arabs Oppose Jewish Immigration: Police and Crowds Clash in Bloody Conflict, Resulting in 11 Deaths and 150 Injuries; Severe Rioting Across Regions</h3>
<p>Jerusalem, Today: A severe conflict occurred between police and Arab crowds in Jaffa today, resulting in 11 deaths and 150 injuries. Arab residents disregarded official warnings and organized processions to protest the increase in the number of Jewish immigrants. This morning, after making impassioned speeches at the mosques, Arab crowds attempted to march to the government administration offices. Each office was protected by police and barricades. Subsequently, the crowds suddenly took action against the government, attempting to breach the police defense lines and attacking government offices from all sides. The police initially tried to disperse the crowds with batons, but without success, then opened fire on the crowd, resulting in fierce fighting. After some time, the crowd dispersed. Eleven people died, and some police officers were also accidentally killed. Two British military officers were injured, and an additional 150 people were injured, with 17 in critical condition. According to official statements, the crowd opened fire first, which prompted the police to return fire. Order has been restored in Jaffa. It is reported that martial law is in effect from 6:00 PM, but there is no need for the deployment of troops. The situation in other cities in Palestine is dire. In Haifa, crowds gathered upon receiving news of the tragedy in Jaffa, but dispersed after police fired shots into the air. Currently, the Jewish community feels deeply uneasy and are moving from the suburbs into areas of concentrated Jewish residence. The authorities have arrested many people, including several Arab administrative leaders. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Since the tragedy of the police-civilian conflict in Jaffa, similar incidents have occurred in various places, with casualties. Here this afternoon, a group of Arab residents attempted to attack a police station. The police tried to disperse them with batons, but they refused to leave, so the police opened fire, resulting in the death of one Arab and injuries to several others. One policeman was stabbed and seriously injured. According to news from Nablus, crowds there attempted to attack the railway station, but were dispersed by police gunfire, resulting in one death and several injuries. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Haifa: Bloodshed occurred again today as Palestinian Arabs protested Jewish immigration. When those arrested in yesterday's disturbances in Jaffa were being transferred here today, some Arabs attempted to break into the Haifa Central Station. Police opened fire, injuring several people. Fortunately, military police arrived in time to assist and the station was spared damage. Soldiers are now stationed on rooftops. Haifa has the appearance of a city at war, and the situation is critically concerning. Martial law has now been declared. Arabs used cars and other vehicles to block traffic on major streets in the city and declared a general strike. Shops are closed and vehicles are not operating, but port construction has not been affected. There is a risk of unrest in Acre. Jaffa is now quiet, but the atmosphere is very tense, and there is concern that news of the unrest in Haifa will trigger renewed unrest in Jaffa. Troops are also stationed at key points for defense. Armed vehicles and troops are patrolling the streets of Nazareth and Safed. A strike has been declared in Jerusalem today, and all commerce and traffic has ceased. The government has decided to arrest Arab leaders. According to news from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, Arabs in Damascus are uneasy after hearing about the events in Palestine, and demonstrations are expected today. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Jaffa: A serious conflict occurred here again this morning when Arabs attacked a police station. The police opened fire. Since the disturbances, one person has died and 35 have been injured, including two British policemen. Special police are being recruited here. According to news from Egypt, the unrest is now spreading from Palestine to Transjordan. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Grave Situation as German Authorities Arrest British Journalist: Leak of German Secrets, Britain Issues Strong Protest</h3>
<p>(London) The arrest of Mr. Panter, a Germany-based correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, may lead to serious entanglements between Britain and Germany. Today, the Foreign Secretary, Sir John Simon, summoned the German Ambassador to the Foreign Office and strongly protested the "protective custody" of Mr. Panter in Munich, stating that Britain cannot tolerate a mere farcical inquiry regarding espionage charges and demanded the presentation of the most complete evidence. Mr. Panter was arrested by the Bavarian police on charges of espionage and is expected to be tried on Tuesday. It is believed that the reason for the arrest is that the German government is dissatisfied with Mr. Panter's reports about the National Socialist Party parade. The British Ambassador to Germany has also lodged a strong protest in Berlin. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Munich bureau of the Daily Telegraph telegraphed this morning that Mr. Panter is to be charged with treason, which carries a penalty of death under the law. Mr. Panter was initially arrested for violating the National Defense Law, but now faces more serious charges. A trial is scheduled to be held at the Supreme Court in Leipzig. However, there has been no concrete evidence of leaking actual military secrets. The date of the trial has not yet been announced. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Munich: The British Consul General, Mr. Gayner, today met with Mr. Panter, the American Daily Telegraph reporter who was arrested for publishing Chancellor Hitler's speech to the Sturmabteilung. It is reported that Mr. Panter will be prosecuted in Leipzig court under Article 92 of the German Penal Code for treason and espionage. This crime carries a penalty of at least two years in prison, but if there are mitigating circumstances, it can be reduced to no less than six months. British Consul General Gayner said that Panter is in good health, although his complexion is pale. According to Panter, he is being treated well and can purchase the items he needs. It is reported that the reason for the charges against Panter is that the reporter published news about the Sturmabteilung and Hitler's guards, raising suspicions that the organization was organized along military lines and that Germany was suspected of violating the Treaty of Versailles. German journalist Ackermann will also be charged with endangering the country by providing news to Panter. Continuing telegram states that Panter will be charged with treason in the Supreme Court of Leipzig, which carries a penalty of death or life imprisonment. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Diplomatic circles believe that the British news reporter Mr. Panter, who has now been detained for five days, will not be sent to court for trial. The Bavarian government's previous statement that it intended to transfer Panter to the Leipzig court to be tried for treason was made before the authorities in Berlin were aware of the true nature of the case. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The reason for the arrest of Mr. Panter, a correspondent for the British Daily Telegraph, has now been announced by officials. It is said that Mr. Panter is suspected of illegally seeking military information. He has been in contact with a German in Munich for some time, who is a spy and often issues false information. After visiting Mr. Panter, the British Consul General in Munich said that Panter has been given all possible comforts. The London Foreign Office must wait for an official report from the British Embassy in Berlin before deciding how to handle the matter. It is reported that Mr. Panter's report to the Daily Telegraph described the National Socialist Party members conducting large-scale exercises in Kehlheim, saying that thousands of so-called non-weapon carrying Sturmabteilung members, carrying rifles and bayonets, marched in formation across the hillside and fired 21 cannons to express their respect for Hitler. This statement is a fact, and other reporters have also reported this. Today, Germany banned the distribution of the London Evening Standard in Germany for one month because the newspaper published a cartoon depicting Hitler standing by a fire outside the League of Nations, with the caption "Since it was done in Parliament, why not do it here?" (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Henderson Announces Earlier Meeting for Disarmament Conference; Representatives of Various Countries Conduct Important Talks</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Mr. Henderson, chairman of the Disarmament Conference, suddenly issued a notice stating that the executive committee of the Disarmament Conference will hold a meeting on November 3. This sudden meeting is six days earlier than the previously decided date. The reason for the advanced meeting was not announced. It is approximately due to the reorganization of the French cabinet. It is widely believed that representatives of various countries are currently holding important talks in Geneva. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Executive Committee of the Disarmament Conference was previously scheduled to reconvene on November 9. Now, Mr. Henderson, chairman of the Disarmament Conference, has suddenly issued a notice, setting the executive committee meeting for November 3, which has generally surprised public opinion here. It is reported that Mr. Henderson convened the Disarmament Executive Committee meeting earlier at the urgent request of the American representative, Mr. Davis, who was unwilling to spend any more time. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Mr. Henderson's suggestion to reopen the Disarmament Conference earlier was met with great surprise here. A certain newspaper said that the executive committee was acting arbitrarily, completely disregarding the outcome of the upcoming German elections. This must be because France's desire for the Disarmament Conference to exclude Germany has gained momentum in circles close to the League of Nations Secretariat. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) British Secretary of State for War, Lord Hailsham, made a speech today in response to the pacifist speech of opposition leader Mr. Lansbury. Lord Hailsham stated that if other countries mistakenly believe that Britain, under any circumstances, would not be willing to use force to protect its own interests, nor would it want to shoulder its obligations to its allies, then future wars would be inevitable. Any country that clearly states that it will not resist even when it is invaded by its neighbors is inviting attack and courting disgrace. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Davis, the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, met with Mr. Sato, the Japanese representative and ambassador to France, this morning. According to reliable sources, the content of the talks concerned recent news reports saying that Japan was not interested in the Disarmament Conference and would even withdraw completely. It is now heard that Japan has no intention of withdrawing from the Disarmament Conference and will continue to cooperate with various countries, but frankly speaking, the nature of Japan's cooperation will only be a passive one, as Japan now believes that disarmament is only an event related to Europe. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government has now notified the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague that since Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it intends to withdraw all pending lawsuits that have not been heard in that court. These include two lawsuits against Poland, one concerning Poland's agricultural reform program for German minorities, and the other concerning the disposal of the estate of Prince Bleres. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Day: Roosevelt's Declaration Promotes a Grand Navy Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today is U.S. Navy Day. The U.S. President declared that during this universal movement to reduce naval armaments, we must maintain the greatest efficiency, the best equipment, and the best military discipline. The U.S. Navy should have the greatest possible efficiency within the limits of treaty provisions. Admiral Stanley said in his speech that a shipbuilding plan is absolutely necessary just from the perspective of efficiency. Currently, the strength of the U.S. fleet is inadequate, and all ships urgently need repair and renovation. If today's navy were to compete with a similar navy composed entirely of new warships, it would undoubtedly be defeated. The U.S. President's declaration and Admiral Stanley's speech demonstrate the U.S. government's determination to build the most efficient navy possible under existing treaties. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American War Debt Negotiations: Efforts to Bridge Differences</h3>
<p>(Washington) As Anglo-American war debt negotiations stall, both sides are working to bridge differences. A New York Times dispatch said that the question of whether a British proposal is acceptable to President Roosevelt will be frankly discussed next week, determining whether current talks can continue. It is widely believed that if a solution is not reached, Britain will make another payment on December 12 to demonstrate its creditworthiness, with final resolution awaiting an improvement in the international economic situation. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The British Treasury denied news that there has been no progress in Anglo-American war debt negotiations. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Communists and Brown Shirts: Arson Accused and Examiners in the Reichstag Fire Case Clash; Assassination of Austrian Chancellor Involves Two German Princes</h3>
<p>(Berlin) During the resumed trial of the Reichstag fire case today, the defendant Dimitrov once again clashed verbally with the examiner. When Dimitrov questioned an Austrian National Socialist Party member, the presiding judge angrily intervened, stating that Dimitrov was not allowed to mention events unrelated to the case and ordering him to conduct himself with dignity. Dimitrov's offensive remarks on the stand were that his tenure in the Bulgarian Communist Party and his work in Germany were just like the thousands upon thousands of National Socialist Party members who used false passports and false names and addresses to work for the Austrian National Socialist Party elsewhere. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Vienna: This afternoon, the police brigade of Schnatting, Styria Province, searched the residences of Prince Ranil and Prince Gode and made startling discoveries related to the previous conspiracy to assassinate Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, involving two German princes. The police found a letter on the brother of Tettier, the assassin of the Austrian Chancellor, begging for donations, the purpose of which was not stated. The person has now been arrested. Among those previously arrested are two distant relatives of German Chancellor Hitler. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss was shot on October 3 and only suffered minor injuries. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>British Ambassador to Russia Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The newly appointed British Ambassador to Russia, Lord Chilston, and his wife arrived here today. This post has been vacant for seven months since his predecessor, Mr. Wovenin, was recalled at the end of March due to the case involving staff of the Vick company being accused. (National Press Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Controls Stock Exchange: Individuals Hiding Cash Charged</h3>
<p>(Washington) Reuters learned today that President Roosevelt is investigating speculation in securities and commodity exchanges, apparently seeking to curb wild price fluctuations. It is said that President Roosevelt is prepared to ask Congress to legislate to expand the government's supervisory powers over the New York Stock Exchange. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) The President of the Stock Exchange recently had a meeting with President Roosevelt, the details of which are unknown. However, it is said that President Roosevelt intends to ask Congress to enact regulations to bring all exchanges under government control. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to a Washington dispatch in a New York newspaper, President Roosevelt's investigation into speculation in securities and commodity exchanges stems from disappointment that the newly announced gold policy has not caused prices to rise significantly. He intends to curb wild price fluctuations caused by manipulative behavior in the market. It is said that President Roosevelt has received information indicating that speculators account for eight out of ten transactions on the Chicago Board of Trade, with a total of 135 million bushels being manipulated by speculators, of which 25 million bushels are in the name of 20 people. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt now holds a huge sum of 5 billion yuan to raise prices, which can be used to improve gold prices. The Financial Relief Agency has raised this sum to carry out its dollar control policy. This sum is used to purchase new mined gold in the form of Financial Relief Agency notes. The notes can be immediately exchanged for cash because they are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States. The notes are due on February 1 of next year, and the amount of gold required for redemption at that time is not yet known, as it can be increased or decreased daily. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Boston: A man named Driskill here has been charged with hiding $10,000 in cash. It is reported that he presented this sum to the Federal Reserve Bank in March of this year but did not report it to the authorities. President Roosevelt ordered in April that all individuals holding more than $100 in cash must return it to the bank, otherwise, they would be fined $10,000 and imprisoned for ten years. Driskill has not complied, so he has been arrested today. This is the first hoarding case. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(New York) Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Horne, gave a speech here today, discussing the execution of the U.S. National Industrial Recovery Act and President Roosevelt's gold plan, and issued a warning against a war to suppress the dollar's exchange rate against the pound, saying that such a war would force Britain to take action to defend its trade position. Horne advocated that the two countries should have an informal understanding to limit the difference between the currencies of the UK and the US. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Roosevelt and Ford Over the Recovery Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) The discord between President Roosevelt and Ford took a further step tonight. The President stated that he believed that the clause in the National Recovery Act prohibiting the government from purchasing products from those not under the Recovery Act could be applied to Ford dealerships, regardless of whether they have the Blue Eagle insignia. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) General Johnson, the director of the National Recovery Administration, warned auto industry giant Ford today that if he did not comply with the request of the Automotive Industry Council to submit reported figures, the matter would be referred to Attorney General Cummings. The Ford Motor Company then released an article stating that Johnson's threats were an unfair act and that Johnson needed to have proof that Ford was not acting in accordance with government measures before acting like a dictator. Johnson then also released an article in response, stating that he did not want to engage in verbal disputes and that as soon as he had evidence that Ford was violating the automotive industry regulations, he would proceed according to the law. (Reuters News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Economic Policy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The new law abolishing the General Affairs Committee of the Deutsche Bank came into effect today. The law authorizes the bank to regulate the financial market, purchase first-class securities in the open market, and use them as additional reserves for German currency. In September, the Bank for International Settlements was asked to approve the new law, which was later approved. At the time, it was stated that the Deutsche Bank could purchase first-class securities to be used as additional reserves for currency without endangering currency inflation. This move does not involve Germany abandoning the gold standard. The Deutsche Bank issued a statement stating that this proposal does not slightly damage the stability of the mark, and the authorities will strictly pay attention to currency stability. Securities purchased in the open market and securities that the Deutsche Bank has supplied for loans will be added to the bank's gold reserves, allowing the expansion of paper currency circulation and enabling the German government to obtain the funds to implement its economic programs. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A major plan aimed at rationalizing the German steel and coal industries is currently under consideration by Germany's four largest companies. These four companies have a combined capital of around 60 million British pounds and now plan to exchange shares and reduce capital to around 40 million pounds, and set up twelve independent auxiliary factories, each limited to producing its special products. The four shareholders will meet in Essen on November 29 to approve this plan. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>International Control of Tin Production</h3>
<p>(London) The International Tin Committee meeting held in London today approved a new plan to control the tin industry, effective from January 1 of next year for a period of three years. The main points are that the quota will be increased to 40 percent of possible production. Other than this, the rest is largely the same as the current agreement. The world's four major tin-producing countries have agreed to set the export quota at 40 percent, and the quota is as follows, Bolivia: 46,490 tons, Nigeria: 10,890 tons. As for Siam, its tin exports are set at 9,800 tons per year. When the quotas of other countries are raised to 65 percent, the quota of Siam can be increased in comparison with the quotas of other countries. The International Tin Committee also agreed to implement a special quota in 1934, accounting for 4 percent of the standard tonnage, after the governments of the aforementioned four countries have accepted the quota of at least 40 percent. According to the Tin Committee's estimates, this special quota can increase exports by about 360 tons per month in 1934. The next meeting of the Committee is scheduled for December 7 in Paris. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>International Restriction of Rubber</h3>
<p>(London) The Rubber Growers' Association today declined to issue a statement on the restriction of rubber development. According to a telegram from Amsterdam, the London correspondent of the Dutch Handelsblad reported that he had learned from well-informed sources that the participation of France in the rubber restriction plan was discussed today. It is widely believed that France's participation is predetermined. It is also heard that French Vietnamese rubber growers are not obligated to restrict production, but if production is too high, a maximum limit will be set. If France approves this proposal, the main obstacle to British cooperation in the restriction plan can be removed. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Counselor Calls on Han</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Mr. Kato, a counselor from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited the Yellow River Bridge today and called on Han. He will go to Beijing in the evening. Han's inspection of the troops and militia stationed in Jinan has been completed. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Russo-Japanese Crisis in March-April Next Year</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the following Moscow correspondence published in the New York Times on the 25th has attracted attention from all parties. The so-called published documents, that Japan did not protest to Soviet Russia, because of the U.S.-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, anticipated the deterioration of Russo-Japanese relations, so the Japanese government was being cautious. The Soviet Russian Federation firmly believes that at this time, it has the strength to not lose even an inch of land, so the Moscow government's protest to Japan two weeks ago was based on this self-confidence. The resumption of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations on the one hand strengthened this conviction of the Soviet Russian government, and the Japanese military knew that due to the U.S.-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, it was not a time for hesitation in terms of strategy. Therefore, the Japanese regard the crisis with Soviet Russia as increasingly urgent. However, the Soviet Russian power in the Far East is not very superior, only better than it was twenty years ago. If the Siberian Railway is cut off at Blagoveshchensk, it can still resist. Also, the Soviet Russian Air Force has seen superiority. In the past eighteen months, ten large aircraft have been built every week, so the newest type of aircraft can carry 200 bombs. Also, Siberia enters the extremely cold season afterward, resulting in the Japanese army being unable to do anything in Siberia. Therefore, the Moscow politicians' so-called crisis will be at its worst in March-April of next year. (Dentsu Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) People from Yingkou say that after Russo-Japanese relations became tense, the anti-Russian atmosphere among Japanese residents in eastern provinces is strong. Japanese students in Yingkou often hold gatherings to conduct anti-Russian propaganda. Many of the local Japanese troops have moved from the Yingkou branch road to the Bei-Ning line to go to northern Manchuria. White Russians residing in the eastern provinces have all been mobilized by the Japanese to go to Shenyang. There is a certain organization. The Kwantung Army has recently sent many secret agents to specifically probe the actions of senior commanders of the puppet army, to prevent them from having contact with Red Russia. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese newspaper says that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to change its attitude towards the case of TASS publishing documents regarding the actions of the Japanese Ambassador to Manchuria, to "let it be forgotten." The newspaper also suggested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs originally wanted to lodge a strong protest and demand that the Soviet government withdraw the published documents. Foreign reporters asked the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the newspaper's reports, but the spokesman avoided answering. (TASS, 26th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Remarks: Negotiations with the United States Can Resolve Everything</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov arrived in Berlin this morning and told reporters that he hoped the talks with Washington on resuming diplomatic relations would not only be preparatory negotiations but could resolve everything.

<h3>Truth About French Investment in Eastern Provinces: French Government Forbids Citizens from Lending to the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a communique stating, "According to news published in some newspapers, Mr. Douliva, a representative of the French National Economic Development Association, seems to have established a French-Japanese joint venture with the aim of investing French capital in Manchuria. Now, according to a statement from the National Economic Development Association to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Douliva was sent to Manchuria for private business, and his trip to Manchuria, apart from making a commercial survey report, does not have any other nature." (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the rumor that the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Paris Economic Development Association each formed an investment group is about the joint purchase of French railway materials, with both sides contributing 250 million Japanese yen. This is a private action and has nothing to do with recognizing Manchukuo. The French government's attitude towards Manchuria does not deviate from the legal basis. If French citizens have loan problems arising from recognizing Manchukuo, the French government will prohibit them. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Mr. Dalivya of the French Economic Development Association residing in Manchuria visited Mr. Tani, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in the United States yesterday to discuss investment in Manchuria, to report on the content of establishing a company for investment projects in Manchuria and requested understanding. It is said that Mr. Dai will sign a draft agreement with Mr. Hatta, Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway, in mid-November, and after the French Economic Development Association and the Japanese-French Manchuria Investigation Committee approve it, it will be officially signed.

<h3>Turkey's Ten-Year Anniversary Commemorates Kemal's Achievements: Based on the New Prosperity of Farmers</h3>
<p>Istanbul Tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The whole nation is paying attention to the extraordinary achievements of President Kemal. President Kemal's success is based on the new prosperity of farmers. Turkish farmers used to be under harsh government and heavy taxes and were in extreme poverty. Now they feel the assistance of the Agricultural Bank and 600 companies. The total amount of loans granted to farmers by the bank and various companies has reached 1,100,000,000 Turkish gold pounds. In addition, the adoption of the Latin alphabet, the exclusion of classical Persian and Arabic terms, and the simplification of education have created a new and practical writing system. At the same time, Islam was abolished as the state religion, no longer subject to the constraints of the Koran. The changes in clothing and social customs prove the new freedom of Turkish women. Women can now hold various occupations in society, and there are female administrative officials and athletes. The budget can be balanced without foreign debt, and the currency has stabilized. Internationally, Turkey's friendship with Russia and its non-aggression pacts with Greece, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Romania have become the elements of the Black Sea Pact. All of these are Kemal's significant achievements. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mexico Discovers Conspiracy to Overthrow the Government: Ring Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>Mexico City Tonight, the Mexican authorities announced that they have discovered a Cuban-like conspiracy to overthrow the government within the army. The ringleader has been arrested, and dozens of junior leaders are being pursued. These people were preparing for officers to start a rebellion and assist revolutionary parties from outside. According to reports a month ago, there was news of instability in the army, but it was not noticed at the time. According to the confession of the arrested persons, these people were preparing to start the rebellion tonight and were preparing to launch it simultaneously in various parts of Mexico. However, it has not yet been discovered whom the army intends to support. It is expected that the content of the conspiracy may contain shocking news.

<h3>The Majority Party in the French Chamber of Deputies Supports the Sarraut Cabinet: The First Cabinet Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Paris) The new Sarraut cabinet will hold its first cabinet meeting on October 30th and will appear in both houses for the first time on November 3rd to announce the new cabinet's major policies. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Senators are adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards the new cabinet and want to judge it after it has taken action. However, the Senate is quite satisfied with the appointment of Gallet as Minister of Budget, because the talent and character of Mr. Gallet are admired by the senators. In addition, there are five senators in the cabinet who are generally employed, so the Senate expressed its support for the new cabinet and is ready to do its best to assist it in shouldering its important responsibilities. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The majority party in the Chamber of Deputies expressed sympathy for the new cabinet, and the minority party did not deliberately hostile attitude. The main ministers of the new cabinet, such as Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance, Army, and Aviation, are still held by the old cabinet members, which shows that Sarraut wants French politics to remain the same. Although the centralized plan of the various republican factions or the more extensive joint plan has not yet been realized, the majority party will soon be able to promote it to the central faction. The Socialist Party of the Blum faction, because the party took a neutral attitude towards this cabinet formation, wants to take the opportunity to rectify the party and seek its unity. As for the minority socialists of the Lulotai and Marge factions, they will probably continue to maintain the government. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Sarraut met with the Vice-Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, the Chief Rapporteur of the Budget Committee, Jacques, the Minister of Education, Tremonzi, and the Minister of Merchant Marine, Stein, this morning. The discussions focused specifically on the economic and financial situation. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Paris Morning Post" commented on the new cabinet's policy guidelines yesterday, saying that the trend of this cabinet is leaning towards the central faction. Its financial plan will not go beyond the claims of Finance Minister Ponlet, Budget Minister Gallet, and Colonial Minister Pitoli. In the past three days, there have been rumors from outside that the Sarraut cabinet intends to temporarily shelve the current financial difficulties. However, judging from Sarraut's invitation to the three to join the cabinet, it can be seen that the delay is completely inaccurate. As for other issues, according to the Paris Morning Post, it will continue the original policies of the Daladier cabinet in general. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new Premier Sarraut is usually very popular in the parliament, so the new cabinet is very welcomed by the parliament and newspapers. The newspapers of the right-wing opposition party are currently speaking very cautiously. The organization of the cabinet obviously tends to the right-wing aspect, so it is expected that the new premier will be able to win a small majority in the parliament in the first few weeks. However, whether the central and center-right wing support or not is still uncertain. When Sarraut proposes the government's financial plan in the future, he will naturally face a difficult test. Today's public opinion here believes that Sarraut may not try to completely balance the budget, but will try to reduce the deficit of 6 billion francs. The rest of the deficit will be compensated after the French economic situation improves. However, all circles of the parliament believe that Sarraut has not yet determined the financial plan. Sarraut still keeps Pengu as Minister of Foreign Affairs and announced that the foreign policy will continue the legacy of his predecessor. The left-wing newspapers have expressed their satisfaction with this and said that Sarraut's declaration contains France's intention not to change its League of Nations policy. The right-wing newspapers also demanded a resolute policy. (27th National Telegram)</p>

This matter should be strictly prohibited separately to maintain salt administration and maintain customs restrictions.

<h3>Ma Chaojun Talks About the Rural Economy of North China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun returned to Nanjing on the 27th after going to North China to inspect the rural economic situation and the situation in the war zone. On the 28th, he told reporters that in the past, the city of Beiping had no facilities for popular education, so the people's wisdom was mostly closed. East of Sanhe in Tong County, the rural economy collapsed, bandits were rampant, and social order was chaotic. The rural situation and economic decline have reached the extreme. Due to years of civil war, the people were tired and the wealth was wasted, and they could not afford the miscellaneous taxes and levies. The cheap grain harmed the farmers, and their income could not cover their expenses. The machine industry gradually developed, and the handicraft industry was gradually eliminated, and the violent Japan also helped to disrupt the situation, so there is the current situation. The credit cooperatives run by the China and Foreign Famine Relief Committee in Tong County have achieved remarkable results. The achievements of the Chinese Popular Education Promotion Association in Ding County in managing education, autonomy, defense, and health are even better, beyond our expectations. The current Hebei provincial authorities have joined hands, and if it is promoted nationwide, the country's future is really promising. (28th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Austrian Coup and the Future of Europe (Part 1) - Lieshan - European Correspondence</h3>
<p>Ever since the two national socialist parties came to power, a popular saying has been circulating in European society, saying that if Hitler exists, Europe will be destroyed. This can also prove that the time has reached the eve of the storm. War premonitions are causing anxiety everywhere. Various peace movements are not only under legal pressure, but their significance is also fundamentally denied in terms of public opinion. The wings of the god of war have already spread across the European continent. Anyone who advocates for peace will be told that they are a fool and to stop dreaming and see what era this is. Anyone who opposes war is simply a rebel. Buzzing, swaggering, and neck-craning military reservists are increasing every day and can be encountered everywhere. A somber atmosphere fills the entire Europe, and everything is being pulled back to the state before the European war.</p>
<p>The main protagonists in this are inseparable from the long-standing feud between Germany and France, and the Franco-Italian rivalry for hegemony on the European continent. Germany and Italy seem to be consistent in theory, but in reality, they are wary of each other. This complex triangular situation also includes Britain's clever diplomacy, never allowing one power to dominate the European continent, and a group of supporting actors, such as Poland and the Little Entente, playing roles for their own interests. Forming alliances and conspiracies, vertical and horizontal maneuvering, everything is available in every color and shape. The first line of fire, diplomatic war, is actually also political and economic war, starting in Austria.</p>
<p>This time, the Austrian coup, by a government that had already implemented dictatorship, went a step further and abandoned even the facade of democratic politics, establishing a genuine, authentic Fascist regime (although Dollfuss himself has repeatedly denied it). This fully demonstrates the complex European politics, including France, Germany, Italy, Britain, and various small countries, not only engaging in behind-the-scenes scheming, but also reaching the point of engaging in hand-to-hand combat. An Austrian newspaper said that the Austrian coup was a matter of life and death for them. In fact, it is not just Austria; in a certain sense, it may even be the entire of Europe.</p>
<p>The brotherly bond between Germany and Austria, which is what both Germans and Austrians, especially the German side, have been advocating for, is the memory in the dreams of the Germans, namely, the merger of Germany and Austria to realize the ideal of a Greater Germany. However, this move is enough to make France nervous. Therefore, in this regard, France's foreign policy has never been easily let go. France loudly advocates upholding the balance of power that has already been established in Europe and vigorously monitors Germany's actions. However, Germany's ambitions will never stop halfway. With the emergence of Hitler, what had been going on in secret has been transformed into a clear-cut policy, loudly proclaiming the merger of Germany and Austria. At this point, the atmosphere in Europe suddenly became even more tense.</p>
<p>Mussolini once said that Fascism has no exit. This has two layers of meaning. First, Fascism is extreme nationalism, and fundamentally there is no room for international cooperation. Second, the real deal is still just Mussolini's family, with no other branches. From this, we can understand why Italy and Germany not only cannot act in unison, but also have conflicting views on the Austrian issue. From Italy's own perspective, what it is most worried about is France, but Italy is also very wary of Germany, especially on the Austrian issue. If Austria merges with Germany, another Greater Germanic monster will emerge, which is also something Italy is extremely worried about. Italy's only ambition is to form an alliance with Austria and Hungary, creating its own superior power on the European continent. To this end, it does not hesitate to secretly seduce Austria, preventing Austria from becoming a possession of Germany. In this German-Austrian conflict, Italy is playing more tricks behind the scenes than anyone else, although, on the surface, it pretends to be a mediator.</p>
<p>Since the European War, Austria's status has plummeted. As a result of losing territory and paying reparations, the development of industrial and agricultural areas is unbalanced, and production and consumption often suffer from the inability to distribute them evenly. The population is only over six million, with Vienna alone accounting for more than two million. Therefore, when the world economic panic came, Austria was the first to encounter it and suffer the most. Although Austria has deep ties with Germany in many aspects, especially in terms of history, geography, and race, considering the economic issues, which Germany cannot resolve for Austria, is enough to make figures like Dollfuss resolutely break with Germany and lean towards France, Italy, and other countries, for the sake of the future of the entire country. This is what we cannot forget. Austria's purpose is to find a way to borrow some money economically to restore the country's economy. However, taking advantage of this opportunity, France, Italy, and other countries pulled Austria over, and Austria immediately separated from Germany. This is the inside story of the German-Austrian conflict this time.</p>
<p>The external environment is so complex that the Austrian government authorities are struggling to cope with it, while the domestic parties and political opinions are even more divided. Simply put, the Austrian political parties in the past can be divided into left and right wings. The left wing includes the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party, and the right wing includes the Christian Social Party (Catholic Party), the Farmers' League, and the Royalist Party. A separate faction is the Austrian National Socialist Party, later led by a specially designated Hitler. The Austrian parliament has a total of 165 members. Except for the relatively weak Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party accounts for a majority of 72 members. Their disadvantage is that there are many factions within the left wing, and opinions are divided. On the common front, the attitude often cannot be consistent. As a result, the smaller right wing takes advantage of it and eventually suffers a complete defeat. Its fate is similar to that of the German Social Democratic Party, but the situation seems even more tragic. Although it is also making strenuous efforts at this moment, it is already too late. Vienna, known as the socialist city, will undoubtedly be greatly tarnished from now on.</p>
<p>Among the right-wing parties, the Christian Social Party is the strongest, occupying 66 members. In principle, it absolutely supports the Dollfuss government. The leader of the Farmers' League, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Winkler, is a person who advocates maintaining the democratic system, especially party politics. Although he is not opposed to organizing a strong government, he is opposed to Fascism. The leader of the Royalist Party, such as the young Prince Starhemberg, is an open advocate of Fascism. He is not only very close to Mussolini, but also has a tacit understanding with Hitler (he participated in Hitler's riots in 1923 while studying at a German star school). He hopes to restore the monarchy and then implement Fascism. Dollfuss himself is between the two mentioned above. For the needs of Austria, he resolutely decided to oppose Hitler. He used the slogan of the party to organize a "Fatherland Front," a semi-military organization. At this moment, he is using this organization as the basis for forming his own dictatorial government.</p>
<p>After July and August this year, the conflict between Germany and Austria obviously became more serious, and the domestic situation also became increasingly complex. The Dollfuss coalition government felt overwhelmed in dealing with it. Although military dictatorship has been implemented, and all powers are in the hands of the security commander or the police chief, the activities of the National Socialist Party are severely suppressed. It is expressly ordered that anyone wearing a swastika badge or singing a National Socialist Party song will be punished with six weeks of imprisonment or a fine of 2,000 schillings (approximately more than 1,000 Chinese currency). At the same time, every effort is being made to search for active members of the National Socialist Party. At the same time, efforts are being made to publicize through leaflets, pamphlets, wall newspapers, announcements, speeches, etc., and vigorously announce the treasonous behavior of the National Socialist Party. The wording seems to be very extreme, for example, calling the National Socialist Party a "contagious disease," "brown plague," or "German-style Communist Party," creating another kind of atmosphere in society, that is, all National Socialists are generally recognized as immoral scoundrels, and Austrian heroes are those who belong to the "Fatherland Front" or "Defense League" and other groups. The efforts of the Dollfuss government have obviously achieved considerable success in this regard, but they have not yet fundamentally solved the problem.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Rebuilds the Confucian Temple; Chairman Chiang Saved It Before; The Local Gentry of the Province Discuss Building It Later</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the Nanchang Confucian Temple was destroyed by wind and rain in the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic of China, it has been reduced to rubble. In the 17th year, former Chairman Zhu transformed the original site of the Confucian Temple into Dachen Park, which was presided over by former Mayor Wu. Later, due to the lack of a person in charge, it was repeatedly used by troops for stationing, grazing cattle, and raising horses, causing irreparable damage. The so-called park is only in name. At the beginning of Chairman Chiang's visit to Jiangxi, he believed that troops should not be stationed in the Confucian Temple and ordered the provincial government to repair it quickly and limited the time for the troops stationed there to move out. After receiving the order, the provincial government immediately sent workers to repair it day and night and had repaired the walls and inner railings. It was originally planned to restore the temple buildings, but the project was huge, and there was no funding, so it did not come to fruition. Therefore, flowers and trees were planted everywhere in the open space to temporarily preserve it. Now, provincial gentry Hu Siyi, Ouyang Wu, Wang Mingxuan, etc., believe that Jiangxi has suffered from banditry for six years, but it has not yet been eradicated. Heretical doctrines are rampant, and evildoers are rampant internally. The morals of the world and the hearts of the people have become extremely depraved. Those who are eager for quick success and instant benefits commit offenses against their superiors and cause chaos, changing their minds and contradicting themselves, without shame. All of this is because the rites and teachings are not clear, and the people have lost their central belief. Our country's cultural relics, rites, and righteousness have always revered Confucius. In recent years, the country has been in many troubles, and the Confucian temples in various places have been destroyed. There is no way to look up to them, so they should be rebuilt to worship Confucius, encourage the poor customs, and widely adopt good deeds. Banditry will be easily eradicated. They gathered all the gentry yesterday for discussion. Those present included Ouyang Wu, Hu Siyi, Fan Zhengbo, Peng Chengwan, Lu Fang, Cai Qian, He Zhihuan, Wang Shan, Wang Mingxuan, Li Shangyong, Zhong Youzu, and Xu Ruifu. It is heard that the decisions were: (1) First, those present were designated as promoters and contacted various members of the provincial government and the provincial party headquarters to join the promoters. (2) Xu Ruifu, Wang Mingxuan, and Lu Fang were selected to prepare and estimate the project. (3) Ouyang Jifu was selected to write the text. (Datong Society, October 26)</p>
<h3>The Commotion in Guangzhou: Authorities Massively Arrest Dissidents; Bandits Throw Bombs in Protest; Japanese Arbitrarily Arrest People</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Chen Jitang launched a massive search and arrest of dissidents, many have been implicated. Lian Bingzhang, the former division commander of the Fifth Army (Li Fulin's troops), has already been detained, and former subordinates of Lian who had no major involvement in the case have also been arrested. Zeng Feiwen, the former chief of staff of Li Fulin, is currently being held in the special room of the Provincial Public Security Bureau. In the navy, He Yilu, the captain of the Jiangda warship, was previously detained. Yesterday, Zhang Ruitong, the deputy captain of the Wufeng warship, was also arrested on suspicion. In the air force, a pilot surnamed Xu was arrested yesterday. Xu graduated from aviation school and has served in the aviation field for many years. The reason for his arrest is allegedly for plotting to mobilize the air force. In the Public Security Bureau, a law and regulations committee member surnamed Lan was detained yesterday on suspicion of being a reactionary. It is said that he has been interrogated and sentenced to death by firing squad. Because of this, a sense of terror has formed in official circles. Furthermore, in society, bandits have recently specialized in sending letters of extortion, placing bombs in prosperous markets and shops, causing unrest in the city. For example, various teahouses have been bombed by bandits more than once. On the evening of the 18th of this month, the Minsheng ferry, which travels between Xihao Estuary, Zhongshan, and Guangzhou, was also secretly bombed in the cabin by bandits. As passengers were gathering that night, a woman accidentally triggered the bomb, which exploded with a loud bang, injuring three female passengers on the ship: Ms. Xu Liang, Ms. Yang Ou, and Ms. Xie. By the time the water police arrived to investigate, the bandits had disappeared. As for diplomacy, Japan has recently adopted a proactive attitude towards Guangdong, first demanding protection for Japanese merchants and second demanding the disbandment of anti-Japanese groups in various places. Recently, it has become even more outrageous. On the 12th of this month, they arbitrarily arrested resident Koreans in Guangzhou. Initially, three Japanese and three Koreans took a car to Yang's residence in Zhuyuan Village, Gospel Village, Dongshan, on the 9th to inquire about the person named Jin Dousan. Jin happened to be out, so a friend, Park Uigil (also Korean), came out to deal with them, answering that Jin Dousan was not here. The Japanese then asked Park Uigil for his name, and Park truthfully told them. The Japanese then left. On the 12th, the three Japanese drove to Zhuyuan again and forcibly arrested Park Uigil and put him in the car without explanation, speeding away. As they passed Dongshan Road, Park Uigil shouted for help. Police heard the noise and wanted to step forward to inquire, but the car had already sped away. They only saw the license plate number as 612. Later, after checking the license plate, they learned that it was the car of the Japanese consulate, and that the arrested person was Park Uigil, a Korean living at Yang's residence in Zhuyuan. The owner of Yang's residence, Yang Shaobi, was originally Korean but has become a Chinese citizen. He has been living in Guangdong for two years, selling ginseng. Park is in the same business and came here two months ago, staying at his house. The authorities believe that the Japanese arbitrarily arresting residents within our territory is a grave violation of international law and have lodged a protest. After Park Uigil was arrested by the Japanese, he was detained in Shamian and temporarily placed in the custody of the French Concession consulate. Recently, the Japanese warship Sagami has been wired to sail into the provincial river, and it is possible that Park will be transferred elsewhere. When the warship sailed from the waters off Shantou, Japanese sailors once landed at Renshan Port in Huizhou, investigating the local household registration and the number of stationed troops, spying for a long time before leaving. The Guangdong government will also raise this point for negotiation. Due to the various disturbances in domestic and foreign affairs mentioned above, the authorities believe that strict precautions are necessary for public safety. They have convened a meeting and decided to hold winter defense exercises ahead of schedule, setting November 1st as the start date for the winter defense martial law period, with the Gendarmerie Headquarters and the Provincial Public Security Bureau responsible for the entire martial law. It is also planned to restore the joint military-police office, with personnel from the General Headquarters' Military Affairs Department, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Provincial Public Security Bureau jointly organizing it. The winter defense martial law is being drafted. The Gendarmerie Headquarters has decided to form a bicycle patrol team of about a hundred people, who will patrol the city streets daily in shifts. All inspectors and detectives of the Public Security Bureau will patrol in shifts on the evening of the 1st, and additional security teams will be dispatched to key locations to check pedestrians' gun permits. Secret agents will be assigned to hotels and entertainment venues for careful inspection to ensure thoroughness and maintain public safety. (October 20th)</p>
<h3>The Northern Route Army Defeats Zhu Mao at Zixi: Joint Air and Ground Bombardment; Killing Over Seven Thousand Bandits</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Zhu Mao pseudo-First Front Army fiercely attacked Xiaoshi, Xunpu, Lichuan, Zuofang, and other places at the beginning of last month. Unable to succeed, they retreated into Fujian's border areas. From the 20th of this month, Zhu Mao again concentrated bandits in the Guangze area, launching a large-scale attack on the border areas. Their strategy was to use the pseudo-3rd Army Corps' Peng Dehuai's troops' pseudo-5th regiment's Dong Zhentang's division as the left flank, attacking the south of the Zixi Bridge from Lichuan, and the pseudo-1st Army Corps' Lin Biao's troops' pseudo-5th Army Corps' Dong Zhentang's other division as the right flank, attacking the north of the Zixi Bridge, attempting to cut off the traffic between Nancheng, Lichuan, Zixi, and Jinxi, and then divide and conquer a part of the National Revolutionary Army, hoping to seize supplies and weapons. At that time, the Wu Qiwai, Zhao Guantao, and Zhou Hunyuan's armies along the Xinfeng, Xiaoshi, Lichuan, and Zixi lines bravely resisted. The bandit masses came one after another, covering the mountains and fields. The National Revolutionary Army then dispatched bomber squadrons to assist in the battle, hovering over the bandit area, concentrating fire, and bombing the densely packed bandit formations, dropping many 50-kilogram bombs. On the 23rd, the battle was the fiercest, with the bandit masses suffering heavy casualties. Finally, they retreated along their original route. The headquarters and provincial government have just received a victory telegram from the front lines on the 24th, stating that over seven thousand bandits were killed in this battle. When the bandits collapsed and retreated, they were extremely disorganized, abandoning countless firearms and weapons. They are currently being pursued. (October 26th)</p>
<h3>Bandits on the Hunan-Hubei Railway Intercept and Rob Trains: Several Passengers Killed and Injured by Stray Bullets; Chang'anling Station Robbed Clean</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: On the 18th of this month, when a train on the Hunan-Hubei Railway passed the Po Station, a freight car suddenly caught fire, burning four cars, resulting in significant losses. The Railway Bureau is strictly investigating to clarify the truth. Before ten days had passed, there was another incident of bandits robbing a train, injuring passengers with bullets, robbing the station, and destroying the tracks. This incident was even more serious than the previous one. The slow train heading north on the railway departed from Changsha to Hubei on the afternoon of the 26th. Rumors spread that the train was carrying over 100,000 yuan in cash, which aroused the bandits' covetousness. At 1:00 AM on the 27th, when the train passed the Chang'anling Station in Linxiang, dozens of bandits swarmed in, firing bullets like rain, and destroying the railway tracks and telegraph lines. They robbed the train. However, the section of the railway destroyed by the bandits was at the southern end of the train, so it could still travel north, allowing the train to escape quickly and reach Puqi Station, which was a safe area. Upon inspection of the train, although no property was lost, several passengers were injured by stray bullets, one of whom died from serious injuries. The driver was also injured. At noon that day, the train arrived at the Xujiapeng Station in Wuchang, delayed by four hours. The injured passengers were all sent to the hospital for treatment. The bandits, failing to rob the train, robbed the Chang'anling Station clean and left triumphantly. After the incident, the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau received a report and immediately sent workers to repair the tracks and telegraph lines that night. On the 28th, traffic resumed as usual. As for where the bandits escaped, it is not yet known. The 19th Division of Li Jue's troops stationed in Yuezhou and the 33rd Division of Feng Xingxian's troops stationed in Puqi have all dispatched teams to search and suppress them. (October 27th)</p>
<h3>Financial Turmoil in Kaifeng: Tongheyu Bank Experiences a Run; Liu Zhi Strongly Urges Banks to Maintain Support</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Recently, major banks in Kaifeng have adopted a non-cooperative attitude towards local private banks, leading to the collapse of Xinchang and a run on Tongheyu. The authorities, recognizing the significant impact on the city's finances, have been striving to maintain the support for all banks. Ten days ago, Liu Zhi instructed the director of the Construction Department to convene banks such as Central, China, Communications, Shanghai, and Jincheng to discuss measures to support Tongheyu. The provincial government also issued a notice limiting depositors to withdraw no more than 500 yuan for current accounts and prohibiting withdrawals for fixed-term accounts from the 14th to the 24th. In the past ten days, the public's sentiment has stabilized slightly. The major banks agreed to provide 560,000 yuan in support to Tongheyu for working capital. The banks initially aimed to bring down Tongheyu. Their willingness to offer support at the time was merely to appease the government and pretend to cooperate. Therefore, after the decision was made, the banks initially used the issue of collateral as an excuse to refuse support. Later, after Tongheyu's Xinxiang Electric Company and 700,000 yuan worth of coal in Jiaozuo, totaling over one million yuan, were pledged, they still refused to provide funds. During this negotiation period, only Henan Agricultural and Industrial Bank provided 50,000 yuan. The other banks only paid a few thousand yuan under the personal guarantee of Liu Zhi and the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the people of Kaifeng are quite dissatisfied with the banks.</p>
<p>Tongheyu depositors believe that the run on Tongheyu was purely caused by the exclusion of competitors. They recently organized a representative committee to discuss measures to support the bank. The committee held its first meeting the day before yesterday, resolving to automatically limit withdrawals and deciding on three measures to maintain Tongheyu's operations: (1) Request the government to extend the withdrawal measures announced on October 14th for ten days. (2) Request the government to use political influence to contact the banks and fulfill the previous agreement, raising 560,000 yuan within seven days to meet the demand for current account withdrawals. (3) The run on Tongheyu has caused panic in the market's finances. The government has repeatedly asked the banks to provide support, but the banks initially agreed and then changed their minds. The representative committee should warn the banks.</p>
<p>The provincial government's announcement limiting withdrawals expired on the 24th. Because the banks had not fully fulfilled the agreement to provide funds, the depositors' representative committee submitted a request to the provincial government to extend the measures for ten days, which was approved. Liu Zhi also sent telegrams to the head offices of Central, Communications, and other banks, urging them to support, stating, "To Mr. Kong Yongzhi, President of the Central Bank of Shanghai, Mr. Zhang, General Manager of the Bank of China, Mr. Tang, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, Mr. Chen, General Manager of the Bank of Shanghai, and Mr. Zhou, General Manager of the Jincheng Bank: I have learned that since the financial panic occurred in Kaifeng, Tongheyu Bank has also been affected by the run, and the situation is critical. I have previously telegraphed you, stating that the matter concerns the finances of the entire province, requesting your Bians office to provide support. In addition to pledging sufficient property, I am responsible for ensuring that your bank does not suffer any losses. Although your head office replied that it would provide support, after discussing with your office for many days, even maintaining a sum of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per day has not been implemented, causing the people of Kaifeng to be very agitated towards your office. I am deeply afraid that accidents may occur and feel ashamed towards your bank. I propose that you find a way to remedy the situation, appease public anger, and avoid trouble. Please telegraph your instructions immediately. Respectfully, Liu Zhi" (October 25th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Coal Cannot Be Sold: Exorbitant Freight Rates Cause Factories to Close</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: China's coal industry is known to be rich. In recent years, foreign coal has been dumped in the market, and the situation has been worsening. Domestic coal factories have been greatly affected, with some suspending operations and others reducing their workforce. Since the September 18th Incident, coal shortages have occurred in various places, and the Shanxi coal industry has been particularly affected. An investigation revealed that the main reason is the excessively high freight rates, especially on the PingSui and ZhengTai railways. As a result, domestic coal cannot be sold smoothly, and foreign coal takes the opportunity to enter the market. Mining companies are closing down one after another, making it difficult to sustain operations. The details of coal transportation on various railways in North China are investigated and recorded below for the reference of those concerned about China's coal industry.</p>
<h3>ZhengTai Railway</h3>
<p>In terms of coal quality, the anthracite coal produced in Pingding, Shanxi, and the clean coal produced in Datong are both excellent. In terms of reserves, Shanxi's mines have more than 5.6 trillion tons, enough to supply the world for thousands of years, which has long been coveted by foreigners. However, due to the high freight rates, it is not possible to fully exploit and supply the needs of various places. The freight rates set by the ZhengTai Railway vary greatly for different mines. The lowest is for Jingxing coal, with a freight rate of 0.0062147 yuan per ton per kilometer. The next is for Baochang and Minxing coal, with a freight rate of 0.01810527 yuan per ton per kilometer. The next is for Zhengfeng coal, with a freight rate of 0.009412 yuan per ton per kilometer. The highest is for Yangquan Baojin coal, with a freight rate of 0.025 yuan per ton per kilometer, which is almost four times higher than that of Jingxing coal. The railway also has a rebate system, but the limits are too high, making it difficult to enjoy in practice. For example, for Class A rebates, from 10,001 tons to 20,000 tons, the rebate is only 4.4 yuan per car (25 tons or less), with a freight rate of 0.0235868 yuan per ton per kilometer. From 20,001 tons to 40,000 tons, the rebate is 5 yuan per car, with a freight rate of 0.0233885 yuan per ton per kilometer. From 40,001 tons to 60,000 tons, the rebate is 5.6 yuan per car, with a freight rate of 0.0231908 yuan per ton per kilometer. For more than 60,000 tons, the rebate is 6.25 yuan per car, with a freight rate of 0.0229753 yuan per ton per kilometer. The Class B rebate system is divided into four categories: 60,000 tons to 120,000 tons, 120,000 tons to 180,000 tons, 180,000 tons to 240,000 tons, and more than 240,000 tons. The amount of rebate is determined by the amount of tonnage. On the surface, it seems to be preferential, but in reality, Yangquan anthracite coal cannot be transported out of more than 60,000 tons per month due to the railway's small cars and narrow tracks, and there is no hope of this. Therefore, the Class B rebate system is equivalent to drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. This is the main reason why Shanxi coal cannot be exported.</p>
<h3>PingHan Railway</h3>
<p>The PingHan coal transportation is lower than ZhengTai. The treatment is also inconsistent. For example, the freight rate for each ton and kilometer of coal from the Liuhegou, Fuzhong, Yili, and Zhengfeng mines is 0.006825 yuan, while the freight rate for Jingjing coal is 0.011935 yuan per ton and kilometer (calculated at 70% of the ordinary freight rate of the PingHan railway). The freight rate for Shanxi coal is 0.01705 yuan per ton and kilometer (calculated according to item 32 of the ordinary freight rate of the PingHan railway). Not only can Shanxi coal not enjoy the same preferential treatment of 0.006825 yuan as Liuhegou Fuzhong Yili, but it cannot be given the same reduced rate of 70% as Jingjing coal.</p>
<h3>PingSui Railway</h3>
<p>The PingSui Railway previously had a special export price for coal from northern Shanxi, which was about 0.01662 yuan. Later, it was heard that the mine owners requested a reduction, and it was changed to 0.0091811 yuan. However, it is still limited to one year, and only those who export can enjoy this special price.</p>
<h3>BeiNing Railway</h3>
<p>The freight rate for coal on this railway is 0.008004 yuan and 0.00734 yuan per ton per kilometer for Kailuan coal, and 0.006667 yuan per ton per kilometer for Beipiao coal. For other coal mines, the special price for export from Fengtai to Tanggu is 0.01 yuan per ton per kilometer, and the ordinary freight rate is calculated at 80%, which is 0.01359 yuan per ton per kilometer.</p>
<h3>Other Railways</h3>
<p>In addition, the freight rate for Hanyeping on the Hunan-Hubei Railway is 0.00642 yuan per ton per kilometer, and the freight rate for Luda coal on the Jiaoji Railway is 0.00761 yuan per ton per kilometer. The freight rate for each coal from Chinese-owned coal mines is 0.0072 yuan. Therefore, although China's coal reserves are rich, the current output is very small. Of the annual consumption of 25 to 26 million tons, domestic coal only accounts for 11 million tons, which is less than half. The rest is dumped by foreign coal. The main reason is the high freight rates, which make the cost very high and cannot be sold throughout the country. Among them, Shanxi's coal reserves are the richest, and the freight rates of the ZhengTai and PingSui railways are the highest, resulting in coal produced in Yangquan and Datong being piled up like mountains and unable to be sold (it is heard that coal factories in the Datong area can produce 5,000 tons of coal per day). Currently, due to the excessively high coal transportation costs on the PingSui Railway, production has been reduced due to its inability to sell. Only 300 to 400 tons are produced per day. Coal factories are forced to lay off workers and reduce their scale, allowing goods to be abandoned on the ground and increasing unemployment. It is truly lamentable. If efforts are not made to remedy the situation urgently, the future is dangerous and unimaginable. (October 24th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang's First District Plans to Establish Experimental Townships</h3>
<p>The various townships under the jurisdiction of the First District Office of this county are handling local self-government quite diligently. District Head Zhong believes that the First District is located in the urban and suburban areas, with convenient transportation by road and rail. People from various institutions often come to Songjiang to inspect municipal administration and local self-government. In order to promote local self-government and improve municipal construction, the district plans to imitate the experimental township methods of the various districts of Qingpu County, and first designate one or two towns in each district as experimental towns. The township offices will actively carry out matters that they should handle to observe the actual effects. This was brought up for discussion at the district affairs meeting on the 28th, and was passed in principle. However, the method for raising funds for the experimental towns will be determined after inquiring about Qingpu County's methods.</p>
<h3>Private Salt Smugglers Arrested for Resisting Arrest</h3>
<p>Yang Zilong, a resident of Punan, is a well-known salt smuggler. Recently, he smuggled a large batch of private salt, planning to transport it to the Xia'ang Bridge area for sale. When the ship passed by the Tuolai Temple, it was spotted by a police officer from the eighth district of the tax police, who ordered it to stop for inspection. Yang and another salt smuggler, Pan Zhuangzi, resisted arrest. The police arrested Yang and others and took them to the district for preliminary interrogation. As the case involved private salt, the police were dispatched to the county court prosecutor's office yesterday morning for interrogation. The two defendants were ordered to be detained pending review.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Wanniang Bridge Fundraises for Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Wanniang Bridge, outside of Xumen, is the largest bridge in Suzhou and an important transportation route for both water and land traffic outside Xumen. However, the stone steps on both sides are very high, making it difficult for vehicles to pass. Now, local business leaders such as Ji Xiaosong have initiated the reconstruction of the bridge with reinforced concrete, which will cost about 10,490 yuan in labor and materials. Yesterday (28th), County Magistrate Zou convened local people to discuss fundraising methods. It was decided to submit a request to the Construction Department for funding.</p>
<h3>District Head Embezzles Funds and Is Dismissed for Investigation</h3>
<p>Sun Zheng, the district head of the Fifteenth District, embezzled wages for digging trenches during the Shanghai War. After being reported to the county government by Zou Gu, the head of the township, and others, County Magistrate Zou summoned Sun for questioning on the 27th. Believing that there was indeed a major suspicion, he issued a hand-written order yesterday (28th) to dismiss the district head first and await investigation. Pan Bangjun, the district head of the Sixth District, was temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. Qin Zhonghuai was dispatched to the township for detailed investigation and reporting for review.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Loan Collection Fails and Ends in Hanging Suicide</h3>
<p>Xi Huian, the owner of Huisheng Silk Factory under Huigong Bridge in this county, was affected by the sharp decline in the silk market and owed more than 30,000 yuan. He took his family and fled to Shanghai on the 17th of this month. He also sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, asking it to clear the factory's debt. After receiving the letter, the chamber of commerce considered it difficult to clear the debt based on Xi Huian's empty words. It immediately forwarded the letter to the silk factory industry association, advising Xi to return to Wuxi and discuss with the creditors in good faith to find a proper solution. However, Xi never returned. The creditors were all worried about this situation. Qin Gengmo, a resident of Zhangjing Bridge in the Seventh District, was also one of the creditors. The portion of the debt owed by Huisheng Factory was 3,250 yuan. This sum was collected by Qin from 284 silkworm farmers. Now, the farmers are demanding repayment from Qin, who is unable to pay. Disputes have arisen. The day before yesterday, Qin's wife, Wu, came to the city and sat at Xi's house in Dunrenli to demand repayment, but she did not receive a single penny. Suddenly, she had the thought of committing suicide, and she went upstairs and hanged herself. Later, she was discovered by Xi's mother-in-law, Zhu, who managed to save her. It was fortunate that it did not lead to a life-threatening incident. More than ten people, including Zou Housheng, the owner of Gongchang Cocoon Company, were also forced by the farmers to sit at Xi's house to demand repayment. They jointly sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, asking it to uphold justice and provide relief. The factory has more than 2,000 packages of dried cocoons stored in Yixin Storehouse, more than 50 loads of silk, 300+ packages of Hixiecheng cocoons, and 500+ packages of Ruichang cocoons that had been loaned to banks such as Jiangsu Bank. After receiving the letter, the chamber of commerce sent staff member Ji Songzhen to contact the relevant cocoon stores and banks. It also sent a letter to the silk and cocoon industry associations, requesting them to urge Xi Huian to return to Wuxi as soon as possible and clear the debts with all parties in order to maintain the credit of the silk and cocoon industry and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Two Arrested in the Dazhuxiang Murder Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Renjin, a resident of Houtangqiao Township, 66th Tu, Second District (Jingyun City), who worked as a bowl repairer, went out to repair bowls on the 11th of this month. When he passed through Dazhuxiang, 595 Tu in the same district, he was suddenly beaten to death by Zhu Quangen, Zhu Xianghe, Zhu Du, Lu A'tu, and others. They moved the body to the railway tracks next to 596 Tu. After examination by the map head, it was confirmed that the death was caused by injuries. However, the perpetrators were still at large. After a thorough investigation by Prosecutor Shen Zhaoming, who was in charge of the case, he issued several arrest warrants the day before yesterday, ordering law enforcement officials Fang Peisheng, Feng Yongbao, Zhou Yizhu, Jiang Yuanzhu, and others to go to the countryside to arrest the perpetrators. Zhu Xianghe and Zhu Du were arrested on the spot. The others are still at large. The two perpetrators were escorted to the court, and after interrogation by Prosecutor Shen, they were ordered to be detained pending the arrest of the remaining perpetrators before further legal action is taken.</p>
<h3>County Court Burns Opium</h3>
<p>After confiscating opium and opium paraphernalia found in investigations within the county, the county court of this county has consistently made a policy to publicly burn the drugs, as a symbol of cleaning up drug. From April to the end of September this year, a total of 171 pieces of evidence confiscated from opium cases were burned on the 28th of this month. Prior to the burning, Chief Judge Xu and Chief Zhou submitted a request to the High Court to send personnel to supervise the burning, and they also sent letters to various agencies and organizations to attend the burning. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the burning was scheduled. The High Court sent Secretary Zhang to Wuxi to supervise the destruction. Chief Judge Xu and Chief Zhou ordered the bailiffs to move the drugs to the courtyard and set them on fire. Many people came to watch the burning, and they all praised the action.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang's Hong Fuyuan's Request for Bail Denied</h3>
<p>Hong Fuyuan, the former magistrate of Pixian County, was detained by the provincial government for alleged corruption for more than a year. After Chairman Chen came to the province, he ordered all corrupt criminals to be transferred to the court for trial. Now, Hong Fuyuan's son, Hong Xiyi, has filed a petition with the court, requesting bail for his father. After reviewing the arguments, the procurator general stated that Hong's case was serious and that bail was not appropriate under the law. Yesterday, an instruction was issued, stating, "The petition has been noted. Your father's case is a major dereliction of duty case transferred by the provincial government, and it is currently under strict investigation. The request is difficult to approve."</p>
<h3>Suspension of Licenses of Pulled Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Government previously received instructions from the Construction Department regarding a case in which merchants had petitioned for the licensing of pulled rickshaws for commercial operation. The county government was instructed to investigate, verify, and deliberate on the matter. It was submitted to the seventh political affairs meeting of the county for discussion. It was agreed that there are currently 850 pulled rickshaws in operation, and 100 rickshaws are privately owned by the rickshaw pullers, which is already more than enough. The licenses of old rickshaw companies that were previously revoked, and for which the county was ordered to allow their resumption when there were sufficient vehicles, have not yet been restored. Before the roads in the provincial capital are fully completed, it seems that there is no need to license more pulled rickshaws. It was decided to temporarily suspend the licensing of new pulled rickshaws. The county government submitted the resolution to the Construction Department for review. After reviewing the report, the Construction Department instructed the county government yesterday to approve the temporary suspension of licenses.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Youth Castrates Himself in Religious Fervor</h3>
<p>Xu Zhilin, age twenty-three, residing at No. 18 Yujing Street in this city, was extremely filial to his parents. He had two older brothers, both of whom were married and established. Zhilin was an apprentice at Zhang Litai's cartwright shop in Guqiting but later became idle at home. He was a devout Buddhist, chanting "Amitabha" daily. Yesterday (the 26th) at 8 PM, Zhilin burned incense and prostrated himself, chanting Buddhist scriptures. He then went to the backyard, grabbed a sharp axe, and ran out with blood streaming from his hands. He rushed out the door, and his family chased after him, but he disappeared. He was intercepted by police officer Yang Hui near Beidajie. Zhilin threw the axe and his severed testicles on the ground. He was sent to Dasheng Hospital on Zuo Wei Street, where Director Jiang bandaged him. The police officer then took Zhilin home. It was reported that he had briefly lost consciousness but then revived. His mother wept upon seeing him. While in a coma from the severe injury, Zhilin continued to chant "Amitabha," comforting his mother with words like, "I'll be fine, I'll be reborn, and you'll all benefit." The superstition of the ignorant is both laughable and pitiful.</p>
<h3>Clerk Dismissed for Forging Documents</h3>
<p>Fang Mianzhi had previously served as a clerk in the Jiangdu County office. He was later sentenced to ten months in prison for bribery. After serving his term, he was unemployed for a long time and his livelihood was very difficult. He wanted to return to his position as a clerk. When Magistrate Ma took office, he was very strict about the collection of grain and money from the various departments and believed that there were many abuses. Fang took advantage of this opportunity to repeatedly forge letters of introduction from authorities in Beijing and the provinces. Magistrate Ma ignored the letters because the wording did not sound like his own. Fang continued to pester him, so Magistrate Ma summoned him to the office to inquire about the origin of the letters and his relationship with the senders. Fang claimed they were from relatives and friends, but he had secretly inquired and was denied by all parties. The police were ordered to detain Fang and send him to court for punishment. The forged letters were from Zhou Renru, secretary of a district regiment, Pan Yunzhai and Ye Xiufeng of the Central Party Headquarters, and Zhao Dihua, director of the Finance Department.</p>
<h3>Sima Town Adds Postal Money Order Services</h3>
<p>Sima Town in the fifth district of this county is located on the banks of the Yangtze River and is an important transportation hub with thriving businesses.

The limit is reportedly ten yuan, and the service began the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Bandit Hu Xiaoxiong Executed in Nanhui</h3>
<p>Hu Xiaoxiong, a notorious bandit from Nicheng in the fifth district, colluded with others in May of last year to rob several residents, including Mao Quanfa, Liu Yulin, and Tang Jinfa. He poured kerosene on Mao Quanfa's wife, causing fatal burns. The victims reported the crime to the county government, which ordered the police to apprehend the suspect in Shanghai and bring him back to the county. Under interrogation, he confessed to colluding with Lao Longban, Chen Xinglin, Liu Genfa, Mao Muxiang, Chen Xingshan, Gu Shengxiang, and others, who were still at large, to repeatedly rob the homes of Mao Quanfa and others. The county government proposed a death sentence, which was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Yesterday morning at 9 AM, the county government brought the convict Hu Xiaoxiong to the execution grounds outside the South Gate, verified his identity, and executed him by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xiaoruo Reorganizes Industries in Nantong</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaoruo, a native of this county, has been stationed in Shanghai in recent years due to his yarn factory and shipping business. He returned to Nantong on the 27th for a stay of about a month to begin reorganizing local industries. The flour mill and iron factory will start operations within the month. Preparations are being made to raise capital for Dasheng No. 2 Factory, which will also resume operations in the short term. The Tianshenggang Power Plant is making active progress and will be able to generate electricity by next spring. The coastal dike for land reclamation and animal husbandry was previously breached by the tide and will be inspected and repaired.</p>
<h3>Suppressing Salt Smugglers in Baochang</h3>
<p>A large group of salt smugglers in Baochang, eastern county, is resisting tax police and have shot and injured the police chief. They are acting very brazenly. Tax police chief Xu Yonghua of the fourth district is leading a team, together with county police, to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Dongwang Temple Town in Liuhe</h3>
<p>Dongwang Temple Town in the eighth district of this county, located near the border of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, was suddenly attacked at around 10 PM the day before yesterday by more than twenty bandits speaking with Anhui accents. They carried firearms and other weapons and broke into Wu Gongxing's cloth store. Store owners Wu Mingzheng and Wu Mingshan, seeing the bandits' ferocity, used a quick-firing gun from their home to resist. However, they were outnumbered, and Wu took the opportunity to escape. The bandits seized the opportunity to search the store, resulting in a loss of about six to seven hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Lawyer Shi Naixiu Seeks Divorce from His Wife</h3>
<p>Shi Naixiu (also known as Shi Feixian), a native of this county who practices law in Shanghai, married Yang Xiuying (i.e., Yang Yingqiu), a female educator who lived nearby, ten years ago after falling in love. At that time, their love was very strong, and they had a son named Yunguan. Shi was hired as a tutor by Yao Xinji's business in Shanghai. During the Qi-Lu War, Shi took Yang to Shanghai and, through a friend's introduction, took on educational duties at several girls' schools. Before long, Shi became involved with someone else and abandoned Yang. Yang returned to Bixian to earn a living on her own. After several years, Shi, with Yang still present, was unable to marry his new love openly. He offered several thousand dollars to persuade Yang to remarry, but Yang remained steadfast. She filed a lawsuit in the local court, which remained unresolved for a long time. In 1930, Shi accused Yang of seriously insulting him and sued Yang in the High Court, appealing to the Supreme Court, which found the appeal to be without merit and dismissed the original lawsuit. It has now been learned that Shi has filed a criminal lawsuit against Yang in the Shanghai District Court, while Yang has hired lawyer Zhu Taiqing to sue Shi in civil court and is seeking the unanimous support of local women's associations. The sensational Shi-Yang divorce case is of wide interest, but how it will be resolved remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Song's Resignation is Firm, Kong Xiangxi Summoned to Beijing Yesterday; Li Shizeng Entrusted by Wang to Urge Song to Return to His Post; New Developments Expected After Chairman Chiang Returns to Beijing; Mayor Wu Says Premier Wang Will Come to Retain Him</h3>
<p>While various parties are still earnestly trying to retain Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Mr. Song did not go to his office at the Ministry of Finance yesterday and remained secluded. Chairman Chiang also returned to Nanjing by plane from Jiangxi yesterday afternoon. As a result of mediation by various parties, a considerable decision seems to have been reached. Kong Xiangxi, Governor of the Central Bank, was summoned to Beijing yesterday afternoon at 4 PM to discuss financial measures. Details of the situation are reported below.</p>
<h3>Summary of Mr. Song's Resignation</h3>
<p>Rumors of Minister Song's resignation have been rampant recently. Yesterday, reporters repeatedly inquired at the Ministry of Finance office and confirmed the news. They also learned the contents of the resignation from other sources. It stated that since the January 28th Incident, he had shouldered the heavy responsibility of finance, maintaining it with difficulty, and that he was physically and mentally exhausted, fearing that he would mismanage the country's major affairs. He requested to resign from all his positions. It is also heard that Minister Song's intention to resign is extremely firm, and despite various attempts to retain him, he has shown no signs of withdrawing his resignation.</p>
<h3>Still Not Working, No Longer Denying</h3>
<p>After Mr. Song's resignation was confirmed, it was no longer denied. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, reporters from various newspapers went to the Ministry of Finance office to see Mr. Song and submitted written inquiries asking: (1) Is the resignation true? (2) In addition to the position of Minister of Finance, will he also resign from his concurrent positions as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Standing Committee Member of the Economic Committee? (3) Request to publish the original text of the resignation. As a result, Mr. Song, claiming to be busy, still sent Councilor Qin Yingchun to answer on his behalf, formally acknowledging that Minister Song had submitted his resignation to the Central Government and that the resignation letter had been sent to the Central Government on the 25th. He resigned primarily as Minister of Finance, and everything else would be left to the Central Government. Yesterday, Mr. Song rested at home, did not go to the Ministry of Finance office, and declined all visitors. Only Chen Xing and others visited him in the morning, and he did not personally meet with other important figures who came to visit.</p>
<h3>Key Finance Officials to Continue Their Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Mr. Song has been meeting with Zou Lin, the Vice Minister of Finance, Li Tiaosheng, the Administrative Vice Minister, various directors-general, and other key officials at his residence for several days. It is said they are discussing the handover of duties. However, key finance officials are determined to continue their responsibilities. According to Mr. Qin Yingchun, a councilor at the Ministry of Finance, Minister Song's resignation is a personal matter, and the staff of the Ministry of Finance will not resign or advance simultaneously. Because the key finance officials are appointed by the government, they must continue their responsibilities and will not advance or retreat based on Minister Song's departure.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Mediating and Earnestly Trying to Retain</h3>
<p>After Minister Song's resignation was sent to Nanjing, President Wang cabled Chairman Chiang and entrusted Li Shizeng to come to Shanghai to persuade Mr. Song to withdraw his resignation. Mr. Li arrived in Shanghai on the 26th and went directly to see Mr. Song after getting off the train. They talked for about two hours before he left. He visited again the next day, earnestly urging Mr. Song to return to his post. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng also visited Mr. Song the day before yesterday, also to persuade him to withdraw his resignation. Chairman Chiang personally sent his wife to Shanghai to retain him the day after Mr. Song's resignation. Various parties in Nanjing also sent cables to both Jiangxi and Shanghai to mediate. Yesterday afternoon, Chairman Chiang flew back to Nanjing and, after detailed discussions with various parties, a considerable decision has been reached. The Central Government will handle the matter based on this opinion.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Flew to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Bank Governor Kong Xiangxi flew to Beijing yesterday afternoon at 4 PM on the Ford aircraft that flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 1 PM yesterday. This was to discuss persuading Mr. Song to withdraw his resignation and financial measures with the Central Government. Mr. Kong's trip is, in fact, to mediate the stalemate.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Says President Wang Will Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Song went out to visit friends yesterday afternoon around 3:30 PM and did not return home until the evening. According to Mayor Wu, who visited Mr. Song the day before, he visited Mr. Song yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) in a personal capacity to urge him to withdraw his resignation. The Central Government will not allow Mr. Song to retire. President Wang will also come to Shanghai to meet with Mr. Song and retain him. It is hoped that Mr. Song will withdraw his resignation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telegraph Office Implements Telephone Telegraph Service to Avoid Delivery Delays</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Hua, the business manager of the Shanghai Telegraph Office, over one hundred merchants from Dalian and Shandong, as well as some foreign merchants, have a special agreement with the office to send and receive telegrams by telephone. Telegrams from Dalian, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places are first reported to the recipient by telephone, and then the original telegram is delivered. If the sender also sends and receives telegrams by telephone, a reply can be received from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places within ten minutes. Mr. Hua also stated that the telegraph office considers the above speed to be too slow. After the Creed high-speed telegraph machine is fully installed, the time required can be further reduced.</p>
<h3>Huang Yunsou Sailed to Mexico Yesterday Morning After Arriving in America</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Responds to Wuxian Chamber of Commerce on Measures to Stop Dumping of Japanese Rice; Urges Government to Implement Dumping Tax; Restrains Merchants from Violating Agreements</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a cable from the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce requesting measures to prevent the dumping of Japanese rice in Shanghai and to maintain the price of domestic rice. It is now known that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has purchased a method and replied to the association. The letters and telegrams are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Wuxian</h3>
<p>To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Reports indicate that Japanese rice is being shipped to Shanghai for dumping, which hinders our country's agricultural production. At a time when the rural economy is declining, allowing the devaluation and sale of rice will inevitably depress the price of domestic rice. This will not only cause a loss of profits and economic panic, but also lead to the abandonment of agriculture and national unrest. Our association is concerned and cannot remain silent. We earnestly request you to take effective measures to prevent this in order to protect agriculture and save people's lives. We are very anxious. The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce respectfully sends its greetings.</p>
<h3>Reply from the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>To the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce: On the 27th of this month, we received a telegram stating that Japanese rice is being shipped to Shanghai for dumping, requesting us to take measures to prevent this. We have found that for goods shipped to China from various countries, except for those prohibited by treaty agreements, we cannot unilaterally prohibit their import. Therefore, in terms of the government, the only way is to adopt a policy of prohibiting through taxation and to promptly implement import taxes on foreign rice. Although our association has repeatedly cabled to urge this, the government is still hesitant. We ask your association to follow this directive and urge this together. As for the merchants, the only way is to strictly restrain themselves from violating agreements. Shenfeng and other eight rice merchants, fearing public censure, are already applying to terminate their contracts. However, rice is not the only Japanese product being dumped in China, and since the end of the war on the Great Wall, solidarity has been noticeably weakening everywhere. We especially hope that your association will work hard to uplift this and prevent others from taking advantage. This is for the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Convening Winter Defense Conference, November 4th, 1 PM</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor and Songhu Garrison Commander Wu Tiecheng believes that with the arrival of winter, it is inevitable that bandits will hide and petty thieves will be active. To prevent this in advance and seek local peace, he has scheduled a winter defense conference at the Garrison Headquarters on November 4th at 1 PM to discuss methods for arresting bandits and ensuring the safety of the people. He has instructed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen and the Security Team and Defense Corps to send personnel to participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Li Xiehe Talks About National Destiny, Worrying About the Future; Social Economy Nearing Bankruptcy; Youth Frustrated and Feeling Hopeless</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that Central Committee member Li Liejun has been feeling unwell recently and is resting at his residence in Shanghai. A reporter from Datong News Agency visited Mr. Li at his private residence on Avenue Massenet yesterday and was granted an audience. Mr. Li did not discuss politics, but was very concerned about the economic panic of society. He said that in recent years, China's social economy has been collapsing. On the one hand, this is the result of the economic aggression of imperialists, but frequent natural and man-made disasters in the country have also contributed to it. The rural areas of the central provinces are already bankrupt, and only the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are relatively stable. In the past two years, due to the impact of the sharp drop in rice prices, rural society is also gradually facing bankruptcy. Shanghai is the essence of the whole country, but since the January 28th Incident, the social economy has also fallen into extreme panic. From what I know, shops on Nanjing Road have always been difficult to rent. Shops often spent huge sums of money to compete for business, but recently there have been many vacant shops, and no one cares about them. This proves the decline of various industries. The industrial and commercial industries are gradually showing signs of collapse. Shanghai is like this, and the interior is even worse. The number of unemployed people today is unknown. A large number of young people feel that there is no way out, and the near future is very worrying. Mr. Li also said that the current international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the situation is becoming more and more difficult. If an international incident occurs, the future will be even more unimaginable.</p>

<h3>Sa Zhenbing Returned to Fujian Yesterday; Relief Work Urgently Needed, He Returns to Fujian First</h3>
<p>Naval elder Sa Zhenbing came to Shanghai alone from Fujian to raise relief funds for Changle. People from all walks of life in Fujian in this area expressed their admiration for Mr. Sa's past achievements and his hard work in presiding over relief efforts in his hometown in recent years. Since Mr. Sa arrived in Shanghai, banquets were held every night. The relief funds for Changle that still needed to be supplemented were originally over four thousand yuan, but donations from all parties reached more than ten thousand yuan, which shows how deeply Mr. Sa's integrity and fairness have penetrated people's hearts. At the same time, Fujian organizations in Shanghai jointly organized the Fujian Disaster Area Relief Association with fellow provincial organizations from various provinces and cities and overseas, and unanimously elected Mr. Sa as the chairman. In the shortest possible time, they will conduct large-scale disaster relief activities to provide emergency relief in the most severely affected areas of western and northern Fujian. Because the relief work in Fujian was unfinished and needed to be dealt with urgently, Mr. Sa took the Wanhsiang merchant ship back to Fujian yesterday. Mr. Sa's relatives and friends and representatives of various organizations in this area went to Jianggan to see him off. The funds raised in Shanghai will be remitted to Mr. Sa for distribution nearby and to preside over everything.</p>

<h3>National Railway Through Transportation Begins, Shanghai-Beiping Direct Freight Car Implemented Yesterday; One Round Trip Between Shanghai and Beiping Every Day; 402 Drove to Beiping Yesterday, 401 Drove to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The national railway is responsible for the joint transportation of goods, scheduled to be implemented on November 1. The Shanghai-Beiping direct joint transport freight car was implemented yesterday. There is one round trip between Shanghai and Beiping every day. The fourth zero one and fourth zero two are designated as the through trains for Shanghai-Beiping joint transport goods. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3>Responsible Joint Transportation Scheduled for Implementation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways ordered the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Jinpu, Beining, Jiaoji, Longhai, PingSui, Zhengben, Daoqing, and XiangE railway bureaus to prepare for the national railway responsible for the joint transportation of goods. It promulgated the 42 articles of the Provisional Measures for the National Railway Responsible for the Joint Transportation of Goods. At the same time, it ordered the various railway bureaus to follow the ministry's current Freight Car Transportation Regulations, the current Freight Car Responsible Transportation Regulations, and the detailed rules for handling procedures, bills of lading procedures, and detailed rules for handling procedures. It was scheduled to be implemented on November 1. After implementation, if there is any loss of goods in responsible joint transportation during the responsible transportation period, the railway where the loss occurred will be responsible for compensation. If it cannot be proven on which railway the loss occurred, the railways that have transported the goods will share the compensation in proportion to the agreed transportation fee. The various railway bureaus have designated freight cars and are prepared. The various transfer stations have been determined, and the driving schedule has also been arranged.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Direct Freight Car Begins</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai, Jinpu, and Beining Railway Bureaus were ordered by the Ministry to open the Shanghai-Beiping freight car, which was implemented on September 1. Due to a decrease in cargo, it was temporarily suspended until the 15th. The Capital Railway Ferry was opened on the 22nd of this month. The Ministry of Railways telegraphed the Beijing-Shanghai, Jinpu, and Beining Railways on the 28th of this month to first implement the Shanghai-Beiping direct joint transport freight car in preparation for the national railway to be responsible for the joint transportation of goods. After receiving the order, the three railway bureaus began to implement it yesterday. There is one round trip between Shanghai and Beiping every day. The fourth zero one and fourth zero two are designated as the Shanghai-Beiping direct joint transport freight cars. Yesterday, the fourth zero two departed from Shanghai Maigen Road Station at 5:20 PM, arrived at the Nanjing riverside at 6:40 AM this morning, and took the ferry across the river. It departed from Pukou at 3:20 PM and arrived in Tianjin at 11:45 AM tomorrow morning. It departed from Tianjin on the Beining Railway at 6:30 PM and arrived at Qianmen, Beiping, at 12:12 AM the day after tomorrow. Yesterday, the fourth zero one departed from Qianmen, Beiping, at 10:36 PM, arrived in Tianjin at 2:26 PM, and departed from Tianjin on the Jinpu Railway at 9 PM. It arrived in Pukou at 5:25 AM tomorrow morning, took the ferry, and departed from the Nanjing riverside at 2 PM, arriving at Shanghai Maigen Road Station at 6 AM the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan Awaits Ship in Shanghai; Will Return to Nanjing by Early Next Month at the Latest; Confidential Agreement Between Jin and Russia Expected to Be Lifted</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Wengan was ordered to go to Xinjiang to investigate the truth about the confidential agreement signed by the former chairman of the province, Jin Shuren, with Soviet Russia and to seek a solution. It has been more than two months. According to sources in the diplomatic circles of this city, Mr. Luo has now completed his mission, left Russian territory, and arrived in Vladivostok, awaiting a ship to Shanghai. He will return to Nanjing by early next month at the latest to report to the Central Government. The government was completely unaware of the treaty signed by Jin Shuren and Soviet Russia beforehand. Therefore, the content of the treaty is humiliating to the country and cannot be asked about. It is heard that after our ambassador to Soviet Russia, Yan Huiqing, filed a protest with Russia, the other party has understood and there is hope that it can be lifted in the future. Jin Shuren has left Nanjing for Shanghai after visiting Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi and Shanxi.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee of Seamen's Union Sends Condolences to Soldiers Fighting Communists in Front</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, in view of the fact that the soldiers in the front are suppressing the communists on a large scale and working hard for the country, sent a telegram of condolences yesterday. The text is as follows: To Chairman Chiang in Nanchang, and to all the generals and soldiers fighting the communists in front: The communists are holding on to their corners and causing trouble in the heartland. For many years, the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian have suffered greatly, and the people have been displaced. It is heartbreaking to hear about the destruction of homes. Fortunately, our Chairman Chiang has taken care of the people and launched a major attack to stabilize the country in this time of crisis and to save the people from the depths of misery. The results have been swift. However, the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the meat on the chopping board is becoming more obvious. Internal security must come before external security, and it is especially important to eliminate the threat quickly. It is hoped that the generals and soldiers in the front will work harder and faster to eliminate the communists and give peace to the people. Our association will lead the seamen across the country to show our support and fulfill our responsibilities in the rear. We respectfully send our condolences. The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union respectfully sends its greetings.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Agencies Commemorate Lin Huanting This Afternoon; Ye Chucang Sent by Central Committee as Representative to Pay Respects; Sun Ke Elected as Chairman of Assembly</h3>
<p>After the death of revolutionary pioneer Lin Huanting, party and state leaders believed that Mr. Lin had dedicated his life to the revolution and to the party, so Chairman Lin and others initiated a meeting to commemorate him to express their condolences. According to the news from the Preparatory Committee of the memorial service, it will be held at the Hushed Society on Guizhou Road at 3 PM this afternoon. The Central Committee sent Ye Chucang as a representative to pay respects. The Southwest Executive Department and the Political Affairs Council also sent special personnel to Shanghai to pay respects. The assembly has elected Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, as the chairman. Many party and state leaders had long-standing relationships with Mr. Lin, and they will surely come in plain cars and white horses, with hats and gowns, to mourn him.</p>
<h3>Dr. Feng Zefang's Thoughts After Inspecting Cotton Production in Hubei</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee of the National Economic Council previously dispatched Mr. Sun Enchen and Mr. Feng Zefang to inspect cotton production in various provinces. Now, we record Dr. Feng's thoughts on the inspection of cotton production in Hubei, as follows: I (Mr. Feng referring to himself) arrived in Hankou on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, I paid respects to the provincial authorities. In the afternoon, I began the inspection with Mr. Yang Xiandong, the chief technician of the Hubei Cotton Improvement Committee. On the same day, I visited the Committee's cotton seed farm in Luojia Mountain. On the 13th, I visited the Xujiapeng Experimental Farm and the Wufengdi Cotton Seed Farm. From the 14th to the 15th, I went to eastern Hubei for inspection, passing through Huangpi, Huanggang, Macheng, and other counties. From the 16th to the 20th, I inspected the Han River basin, passing through Hanyang, Hanchuan, Yunmeng, Yingcheng, Jingmen, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Mianyang, and other counties. Based on my observations, eastern Hubei is almost entirely planted with Chinese cotton. From Lijiaji to Macheng, the Chinese cotton I saw along the way had many bolls, proving its abundant yield. Moreover, in mid-October, the cotton bolls and fibers were almost entirely mature, indicating its early maturity, which is suitable for the need for two crops a year. However, the Chinese cotton seen in this area has fibers that are too coarse and short, mostly less than three-quarters of an inch, which is not suitable for spinning. It is advisable to promote the already improved Chinese cotton in this area, so that its fibers are longer than seven-eighths of an inch to one inch, to meet the needs of the yarn mills, while maintaining its original high yield and early maturity, etc., to suit the local agricultural conditions. As for whether American cotton can be planted in this area in the future, it still needs to be tested in the future. As for the Han River basin, the soil along the banks of the river from Shayang to Hankou is excellent alluvial soil, which is most suitable for cotton production and is truly a naturally suitable area for cotton. Along the way, from Shayang to Zhangjiegang, I saw mostly American cotton, and it was almost impossible to see traces of Chinese cotton. From Yuekou downwards, Chinese cotton fields and American cotton fields are mixed together, and in one field, Chinese cotton and American cotton are often mixed together. According to preliminary field investigations, the American cotton has mostly degenerated. The American cotton bolls are very small, the seeds are green and small, and the fibers are mostly shorter than seven-eighths of an inch. It matures late, and even on the 20th, when the plants are about to be pulled out, there are still many green bolls on the cotton plants that have not opened. Its yield cannot be estimated because farmers pick the cotton together with the boll husks when picking the cotton. According to farmers, the yield of American cotton is better than that of Chinese cotton, so the area planted with American cotton is increasing year by year. Based on this situation, in the Han River basin, where farmers are already accustomed to planting American cotton, it seems advisable to promote American cotton. Special attention should be paid to early-maturing varieties, because in the American cotton area, farmers still practice the two-crop-a-year system. The above is an emergency promotion method. As for which varieties should be promoted in Hubei Province in the future, there is no experimental basis at present, so it cannot be established. However, according to this preliminary observation, American cotton should pay attention to early maturity. 'Shuo Zi' cotton is the earliest maturing American cotton currently available in China, and it is very likely to be promoted. According to the results of the cooperative cotton planting experiment jointly organized by the Hubei Cotton Improvement Committee and cotton farmers in Yanglinzhou near Xiantao Town, Ganyang County this year, 'Tuo Zi' cotton matures earlier than 'Ai Zi' cotton and has a higher yield. The fiber is mostly one inch long, which is suitable for the needs of yarn mills. Before the results of variety trials are obtained, it is safer to promote this variety on a small scale. As for Chinese cotton, according to the results of the cooperative cotton planting experiment area of the Hubei Cotton Improvement Committee in Yanglinzhou this year, local farmers are very welcome to 'Million' cotton (I don't know about eastern Hubei), so it is possible to try to promote 'Million' cotton in the vicinity. As for which varieties to promote throughout the province in the future, my opinion is the same as that of Dr. Loff (the current agricultural advisor of the Ministry of Industry, who was invited by the Hubei Cotton Improvement Committee at the end of last month to come to Hubei to inspect cotton production). It is appropriate for the whole province to select five or six cotton production centers, collect famous varieties from home and abroad, and conduct regional trials for two or three years, which can prove which varieties are most suitable for promotion. Someone asked whether it is possible to purchase a large amount of cotton seeds from foreign countries and distribute them to Hubei now. I think it is impossible. I have been inspecting cotton areas in the United States for two months now and have visited a total of five cotton production experiment stations and seed companies. I know very well that even in the United States, it is impossible to obtain a large amount of purebred seeds. Most of the experimental fields have limited areas and cannot supply a large amount of purebred seeds. Even large-scale seed companies cannot purchase 1,000 dan of purebred seeds from one place. If you want a large quantity, you have to find it from the ginning mills, and the cotton seeds from the ginning mills are mostly mixed. Americans all know this. It is very dangerous to promote American varieties without first testing them in China. Therefore, even if you want to promote American cotton, you must select the most promising American cotton after three years of regional trials, import a certain amount from the United States, and propagate it in the Chinese experimental field before promoting it, which is safe and cheap. Someone also asked whether it is possible to purchase a large number of cotton seeds from its region (such as the upper reaches of the Xiang River) and promote them to other regions (such as the lower reaches of Hankou). I am very skeptical about this matter. According to this preliminary field observation, whether it is Chinese cotton or American cotton, there are currently no purebred varieties that are considered good. Mutual dissemination is nothing more than birds of a feather. How effective it will be is difficult to predict. As for permanent improvement work, it should be borne by the experimental field. The Hubei Cotton Improvement Committee's experimental general farm and two cotton seed farms are already roughly scaled and can undertake breeding and promotion work. In the future, after the establishment of the College of Agriculture of Wuhan University, the research on basic knowledge of cotton production can be undertaken by the university. Cooperation between the two parties will surely lay a solid foundation for the improvement of Chinese cotton production.</p>

<h3>After the Min and Hakka Merchants Refused to Load the Taishun Ship, China Merchants Bureau Declared a Price Reduction to Attract Customers; Freight Rates Reduced by 25% from Today; Sanbei and Other Companies Expressed Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>The New Sound Society reported that since the China Merchants Bureau's ships sailing on the Shanghai-Fujian line were refused loading by the Fujian merchants, the business volume decreased with each departure. Yesterday, a declaration was specially issued, detailing the process and implementing a 25% reduction in freight rates, which caused dissatisfaction among Sanbei, Chang'an, Yihua, and other companies. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Price Reduction to Attract Customers</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau issued a public declaration soliciting Fujian goods yesterday, saying, "It is found that in the past, due to various reasons, the treatment of various merchant guilds in the transportation of Fujian goods by our Bureau's ships may have been uneven. Now that our Bureau has been changed to a state-owned enterprise, we should pay more attention to the maintenance of domestic shipping and the convenience of cargo and passengers. The treatment of various merchant guilds when reporting the loading of goods should also be the same. In the future, all legitimate merchants who come to the Bureau to report the loading of Fujian goods will be sincerely welcomed. Furthermore, our Bureau's ships started sailing to Fujian the earliest. Now, in order to expand business, we should strengthen ties with various merchant guilds and work together for progress. From now on, all freight rates between Fujian and Shanghai will be reduced by 25% on the gross amount on a trial basis to attract more customers. Our Bureau's Taishun ship has been sailing on the Shanghai-Fujian route for a long time. Its speed and load capacity are all suitable. It is hoped that various merchant guilds and firms will report and load Fujian goods on our Bureau's ships at any time. Not only will our Bureau's business gradually develop, but the prosperity of the Fujian market may also benefit slightly. This is hereby declared, and it is hoped that it will be appreciated."</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction Among Competitors</h3>
<p>The ships of various shipping companies operating between Shanghai and Fuzhou include the China Merchants Bureau's Taishun ship, the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship, the Yihua Company's Jiesheng ship, the Chang'an Company's Hua'an ship, and the NingShao Company's Yongxing ship, totaling five ships from five companies. Now, the NingShao Company's Yongxing ship has run aground and sunk in the Zhejiang waters. After the China Merchants Bureau's Taishun ship was refused loading by the Fujian merchants, the Shanghai Shipping Association took on the role of mediation and tried to dredge the situation. It was originally scheduled to hold another meeting yesterday to continue the dredging. Now, after the China Merchants Bureau specially declared a 25% reduction in freight rates, various companies such as Sanbei are deeply dissatisfied and may be affected by the China Merchants Bureau's price reduction and follow suit with price reductions.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Sets Up Seven Offices for Poor People to Borrow Capital</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee organized the "Poor People Borrow Capital" program to help poor people and regulate finance so that the social economy can circulate. The Central News Agency reporter specifically asked the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau who manages the "Poor People Borrow Capital" program about this matter yesterday. The conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Circumstances</h3>
<p>Before January 28th, the city's "Poor People Borrow Capital" program was all organized by the Social Affairs Bureau, divided into two capital borrowing offices in Nanshi and Zhabei. The Social Affairs Bureau had original funds of about 40,000 yuan, which has increased to 45,000 yuan over the years due to interest profits. However, in the Zhabei area, it has been difficult to recover capital after the war. Poor people in Jiangbei have either fled or died, making it difficult to trace, so the loss is estimated to be more than 3,000 yuan. Currently, in the Zhabei area, there is already a "Poor People Borrow Capital" office organized by the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, which is larger in scale and entrusted to the Social Affairs Bureau for management, so the Bureau has stopped the old "Poor People Borrow Capital" office in Zhabei and only manages one office in Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>
<p>The War Zone Rehabilitation Committee's "Borrow Capital" office is funded by 250,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance and another 170,000 yuan from previous horse racing charity tickets, totaling 420,000 yuan. However, the Social Affairs Bureau's agency has received an actual amount of 360,000 yuan. The rest has not been fully received because it is not urgently needed. Among this amount, 200,000 yuan was taken by the Education Bureau and allocated for war zone school relief. As for the "Borrow Capital" offices, there are seven in total: (1) Zhabei District, (2) Jiangwan District, (3) Yinhang District, (4) Yinxiang District, (5) Zhenru District, (6) Wusong District, (7) Pengpu District.</p>
<h3>Types of Loans</h3>
<p>There are four types of loans available at the "Borrow Capital" office: the first type is "Poor People Borrow Capital", the second type is "Agricultural Borrow Capital", the third type is "House Building Borrow Capital", and the fourth type is "Small Industry Borrow Capital". "Agricultural Borrow Capital" uses the farmer's land deeds as collateral. "House Building Borrow Capital" is one of the disaster area restoration plans, so that disaster victims can restore their old businesses in the Zhabei area. "Small Industry Borrow Capital" is available for small businesses such as sock factories and small businesses dealing with cotton, wool, copper, iron, and glass utensils. Loans can be borrowed from the office without interest, ranging from 50 yuan to 500 yuan, and are repaid in four years. As for "House Building Borrow Capital", the Jiangwan District has taken the most, totaling 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Repayment Method</h3>
<p>The nature of the Social Affairs Bureau's "Borrow Capital" office and the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee's "Borrow Capital" office are slightly different. The "Borrow Capital" office organized by the Committee is purely charitable, while the Social Affairs Bureau's office is to regulate the social economy and is not entirely a charitable undertaking, so a small amount of interest must be charged. For example, if a small business vendor borrows 20 yuan, they are ordered to repay 1 yuan per day until it is paid off, with an interest of 23 cents. However, in order to prevent them from escaping and evading debt, their residence must be clear, and they must be ordered to ask a shop as a guarantor. If necessary, the Public Security Bureau will still jointly manage the matter with the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Haichang Company's Haishun Ship Shelters from Wind in Huidao Island; People and Ships are Safe and Sound; Should be Able to Return to Shanghai Within a Few Days</h3>
<p>The Haichang Shipping Company at 79 Gongguan Road in this port has two ships, Haiping and Haishun, sailing to Dalian, Yingkou, and other places in northern China. The Haiping ship is being repaired in Dalian. The Haishun ship, due to sluggish business in northern China recently, loaded a large batch of flour and grain in Shanghai on the 16th of this month and set off for Xiamen to unload. On the 23rd, after unloading passengers and cargo in Xiamen, it went to Keelung to add coal and came to Shanghai. The company planned that the ship would load flour and set off for Yingkou immediately after returning to Shanghai. It was calculated that the ship would only take three days to travel from Xiamen via Keelung to Shanghai. According to the usual practice, it should have arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 25th or 26th, but it had not arrived in Shanghai by the 27th. There have been strong winds in the South China Sea recently, and the company was very anxious, so it sent a radio inquiry. The radio station was unable to respond, and the company was even more worried. So, yesterday morning, it sent people to inquire about the news everywhere and urgently telegraphed the agency in Xiamen to inquire. It received a reply at 1 pm, which said, "(Original telegram) Sheltering from the wind at anchor in Huidao Island." The company was relieved after receiving this telegram. It is said that Huidao Island is outside Xinghua in Fujian. Currently, the ship is still there and has not yet weighed anchor. It should be able to return to Shanghai in the next two or three days. Once it arrives in Shanghai, it is said that it will still sail to Niuzhuang according to the scheduled sailing schedule.</p>
<h3>Qinghai Prince Ya Qingzhai Visits Zhabei Water Plant</h3>
<p>The Hualian News Agency reported that Qinghai Prince Ya Qingzhai came to Shanghai via Beijing for public affairs this time to discuss the development of Qinghai gold mines with overseas Chinese leaders in Shanghai. Yesterday, Xu Chunrong, director of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and Huang Jianzhong, director of the Huanan Zhiye Company, visited the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. Mr. Ren Jiang'er, an engineer from the plant, guided and explained the process, and tested the microbacterial content of the plant's tap water and the high voltage of the generator on the spot. Prince Ya praised the magnificent scale and orderly organization of the plant. He left a poem in Qinghai script at the plant as a souvenir. Then, Xu and Huang accompanied him back to Shanghai to visit various places selling domestic products.</p>
<h3>Public Security and Finance Bureaus Stipulate the Scope of the New Vegetable Market on Chezhan Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Group had previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government to build a small vegetable market at the intersection of Chezhan Road and Lujiabang Road, and to move the vegetable stalls currently set up on Jiangyin Street into the market. Although the stall owners opposed and petitioned, it has been rejected by the Municipal Government. Now, the newly built vegetable market has been completed. It should be approved by the Public Security and Finance Bureaus through the Charity Group, and the stall owners will be drawn by lot to determine the stalls. Yesterday, the Public Security and Finance Bureaus issued a notice and demarcated the area east to Kualong Bridge, south to Chezhan Hou Road, west to Sanguantang, and north to Anlan Road as the scope of the vegetable market. All vegetable stalls on various roads within this area must be moved into the vegetable market for sale. Otherwise, strict measures will be taken.</p>
<h3>Summary of the Second Disaster Relief in Baoshan County</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society previously provided the first disaster relief to the four sandbars of Shidong, Zhongxin, Changxing, and Dingfeng in Wusong. The Society distributed a total of 160 shi of relief rice. In the second hurricane and tidal wave, the four townships of Ruiyongding Township, Ping'an Township, Shidong Township, and Jiangxinsha Township were also severely affected. For the second time, the Society publicly appointed Director Wang Youyi and Ding Zhenyan as relief directors, who, together with the relief workers, transported rice to the disaster area, conducted on-site investigations, and distributed the rice according to the severity of the disaster, divided into three levels: 6 sheng, 7 sheng, and 8 sheng per large mouth, and 3 sheng and 4 sheng per small mouth. Those who were particularly miserable were given an appropriate increase. A total of 91 shi, 9 dou, and 2 sheng were distributed to Ruiyongding Township, 72 shi to Ping'an Township, 53 shi, 3 dou, and 8 sheng to Shidong Township, 38 shi, 7 dou, and 4 sheng to Jiangxinsha Township, and 9 shi, 8 dou, and 2 sheng to other zero relief, totaling 265 shi, 8 dou, and 6 sheng of relief rice. This disaster relief in Changxing Sand was handled exclusively by the Chinese and Foreign Charitable Relief Society, and the disaster victims benefited equally. The temporary relief is to save the current situation, but winter is approaching, and the days are getting longer. There is a lack of aftercare methods, and what can be done is a sigh.</p>
<h3>Winning of Zero-Value Construction Lottery Tickets is Not Affected in Any Way</h3>
<p>Since the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office announced that if the first prize is won in the returned ticket numbers of the second phase lottery, the government will donate the 500,000 yuan prize money that the first prize itself should have received to the ticket buyers as a special prize, and re-draw until it is won in the sold tickets, most ticket buyers have been concerned about the second phase lottery, which is issued in strips. If the number of the first prize is drawn, only one or two strips or three or four strips are sold, and the remaining strips of the same number have been returned and accepted by the government, then how will it be handled? According to the person in charge of the office, although the second phase lottery is issued in strips, it has been agreed with the general managers of the sales agents in various provinces that if a lottery number (i.e., one ticket) has been sold according to the strips, regardless of whether nine strips or only one strip has been sold, all remaining unsold strips, from one strip to nine strips, cannot be returned and will be counted as sold. Therefore, there is no problem at all, and ticket buyers can rest assured.</p>
<h3>China Economic Credit Cooperative is Ready; Initiators' Meeting Held at the YMCA Yesterday; Establishment Set for Tomorrow and Opening on the 11th of Next Month</h3>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative has been in preparation for more than a year and is now ready. Yesterday afternoon at 1 pm, the Initiators' Meeting was held on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Dozens of people attended, including Zhang Shouyong, Qiu Hanping, Lin Zhongke, Jiang Jianbai, Zhang Yongnian, Yang Junlin, Xia Fengqi, Zhang Chuming, Zhuang Zutong, Chen Kan, Zheng Tianren, Wu Jingrui, Zhou Jisheng, Zhang Jixin, Zhang Guorui, Wu Kesong, Ming Yaowu, and Qiu Jinxian. The meeting was chaired by Qiu Hanping, who reported on the preparation process, detailed the business policy, the interests of the members, and the various expenses of starting the business. Then, Zhang Shouyong, Jiang Jianbai, Lin Zhongke, Zhang Yongnian, Zhuang Zutong, Zhou Jisheng, and other gentlemen successively expressed their opinions, saying that society has high hopes for the Cooperative. Before the Cooperative has even opened, those who are willing to join have been enthusiastic, so the responsibility of the Cooperative's colleagues is very heavy. The interests and protection of the members who join the Cooperative should sacrifice the interests of all colleagues and strive to achieve them. Then, the business charter was studied, and everyone was satisfied with the various benefits that the members should enjoy. It was then resolved to convene an establishment meeting at the Cooperative's location at 455 Hankou Road on the 30th of this month, and it was decided to hold an opening ceremony at 11 am on the 11th of next month.</p>
<h3>Dental Hospital Launches Oral Hygiene Association</h3>
<p>The Oral Hygiene Association was launched by dentist Zhou Jianjun, and has been supported by Shanghai celebrities Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Jiaobo, Hong Yanbin, Chen Bogang, and other gentlemen. It has been established at the Shanghai Dental Hospital at 876 Aidaoya Road (west of the Great World). The purpose of the Association is to promote oral hygiene and oral cleanliness. The health of teeth is not only related to appearance, but also to the digestion of the stomach and the construction of overall health. It is said that members only pay 5 yuan in national currency per year and can receive three free teeth cleaning and three oral examinations. In addition, if various dental diseases occur within this year and require treatment, filling, extraction, and other surgeries, no fees will be charged. The Association's current recruitment of members is limited to 300 people. Those who have gone to join the Association in recent days have been quite enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Doctors' Association to Hold General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Doctors' Association is scheduled to hold its autumn members' meeting today (the 29th) at 4 pm in the hall of Yipinxiang on Xizang Road to discuss important proposals and elect new officers. It is reported that all members who attend today will receive a copy of Dr. Song Guobin's book "Medical Ethics" and various medicines distributed by major pharmaceutical factories. The meeting agenda is as follows: (1) Paying respects to the flag of the Party and the State and the portrait of the Premier; (2) Respectfully reading the Premier's will; (3) Three minutes of silence; (4) Chairman's report; (5) Report of the Economic Committee; (6) Report of the Editorial Committee; (7) Welcoming new members; (8) Addresses by representatives; (9) Discussion of proposals; (10) Election of officers; (11) Dinner.

<h3>Women's Service Society to Hold a Grand Dance Party 丨 To Raise Funds for the Shanghai YWCA 丨</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Service Society will hold a dance party at the Yiyuan on October 30th to raise funds for the Shanghai YWCA. This has been briefly reported previously. It is now learned that in addition to dancing on the day, there will also be very valuable programs, such as a piano solo by Ms. Wu Leyi. Ms. Wu is only fifteen years old and has a special talent for music. She won an honor at the centenary music conference of a great German musician in Germany several years ago. In addition, there will be Spanish dance, modern dance, toe dance, etc. by students of Ms. Su Mo's children's dance school. At that time, it will cause a sensation in the surrounding area, and all the ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai will gather, making a great contribution to society and the women's community. It is heard that there are not many tickets left. Those who want to participate are invited to pre-purchase them at the Shanghai YWCA at 8 Bing Yuanning Road.</p>
<h3>Judge Yang Yang's Destitute Aftermath; Legal Profession Collects Money to Assist</h3>
<p>Yang Yang, a judge of the civil court of the Shanghai Special District First District Court, served for three years, was honest and self-disciplined, and was not afraid to ask for details in the trial and interrogation of a case, so the parties and lawyers were quite convinced. Unfortunately, he died of illness this month. His aftermath was quite desolate. Even his burial clothes were subsidized by others, which clearly shows that he had no savings. When he passed away, his wife was pregnant and about to give birth, so the widow and orphan will have a difficult life in the future. The lawyers in Shanghai, because he was fair in his work during his tenure and his situation after death was pitiful, many people sent condolences or collected money to help. The other day, Cantonese lawyers Yang Guoshu and Ge Zhaoji were having dinner at Guangzhenlou on North Sichuan Road. When they talked about Judge Yang's situation after his death, they all admired his integrity during his lifetime, so his aftermath was miserable. So, they asked Lawyer Yang to draft an initiative to collect funds to give condolences, which is currently in progress.</p>
<h3>Woman Shen Yuqin Sues Her Brother for Division of Property; Reconciliation Deadline Set</h3>
<p>Shen Yizhen, residing at No. 279 Yulin Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, works as a builder. After the death of his father, Shen Muying, he seized all of the over 300,000 (currency unspecified) in inheritance, treating it as his own, disposing of and mortgaging it at will. He completely disregarded his two sisters who had the right to inherit the property, prompting his sister Shen Yuqin to hire lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang to file a lawsuit for division of property in the First Special District District Court. She requested a judgment ordering the defendant to hand over all movable and immovable property for division into three shares. Shen Muying and his wife had one son and two daughters. The son is Yizhen. Besides Yuqin, another daughter is married with the surname Huang. Although Yuqin is of considerable age, she remains unmarried and currently resides at No. 22 Datong Lane, Baker Road. Muying was a carpenter by trade, and came to Shanghai in his thirties to make a living. Initially quite poor, he established himself through diligence and thrift over twenty years. He died of illness this June. His son, Yizhen, harbored ulterior motives and did not include the names of his two sisters in the obituary. Subsequently, he gradually sold or mortgaged the property. After discovering this, Yuqin felt that her father's bones were not yet cold, yet her brother was acting this way. If she remained silent, her inheritance rights would inevitably be completely infringed upon. She then requested the court to allow the division of her father's property equally among the three siblings. The initial trial resulted in a ruling that the plaintiff, the defendant, and their married sister all had equal inheritance rights, and the request to divide the inheritance into one-third shares was deemed appropriate, and the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. Unexpectedly, Shen Yizhen was unconvinced and again hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun, who defended him in the initial trial, to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, claiming that the property was not inherited from his father but was acquired by him personally. He requested the original judgment be overturned, but also secretly asked people to mediate a reconciliation with Shen Yuqin to avoid legal sanctions. Until yesterday afternoon, when the Second Branch of the High Court convened a hearing, lawyer Peng still appeared in court, stating that the appellant and the appellee were siblings and were currently in mediation, requesting an adjournment, etc. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng also appeared in court on behalf of Shen Yuqin, stating that since the appellant had requested an adjournment for reconciliation, she would not object. Presiding Judge Han Zuzhi, in order to expedite the case to avoid backlog, ordered that the hearing begin on one hand, and reconciliation efforts continue on the other. Lawyer Peng first presented the appellant's reasons for the appeal, and lawyer Zhan then refuted them point by point. Judge Han then announced a deadline for the appellant to reach a reconciliation within three days. If no agreement was reached by then, the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of November 1st.</p>

<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse at Dada Wharf</h3>
<p>An unidentified male corpse floated up at about 8 o'clock yesterday morning near the Dada Wharf at No. 4 the Bund, outside the 16th Section of the South City. The body was wearing a gray serge jacket, a blue willow-patterned flannel short shirt, and was naked from the waist down. He appeared to be about thirty years old. The water police officers discovered the body and immediately notified Tongren Futang by telephone, dispatching workers to retrieve it. Since no family members were found, the charitable organization collected the body.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Comrade's Downfall: Liang Tongfang Pulls a Rickshaw, Returning Home from the Military with Unfulfilled Aspirations, Grieving as He Gazes North at Yan and Yun</h3>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, many patriotic youths in the country joined the military, traveling thousands of miles to the Northeast to aid the national crisis. However, the national situation is like a game of chess, unpredictable. After the signing of the North China Ceasefire Agreement, those who had gone to the Northeast with aspirations could not fulfill their wishes and returned south in disappointment. A reporter from the Fuxing Society met yesterday with Liang Tongfang, a former member of the 19th Route Army Student Corps and the 3rd Brigade of the Shanghai Civilian Volunteer Army. He returned from the Northeast and has fallen to the point of pulling a rickshaw in Shanghai to make a living. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Liang's Background</h3>
<p>Liang is 24 years old, from Shangyu, Zhejiang. He studied in his hometown as a child, but was unable to continue his studies due to poverty. In his youth, he was introduced by a relative to work at Jinhe Qianzhuang on Fuzhou Road in this city. He continued to study at night school, and was therefore highly valued by the manager of the Qianzhuang. After the January 28th Incident, Liang joined the Civilian Volunteer Army, and later entered the 19th Route Army as a student in the accompanying corps, under the command of Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan.</p>
<h3>Going North to Participate in the War</h3>
<p>After Liang completed his training under General Weng Zhaoyuan, he joined the Shanghai Student Army Northeast Volunteer Group. He departed from Wuxi and went north to Beiping, residing in the first dormitory of Feng Yong University inside Xizhimen. On January 5th of this year, he departed for Yuguan and was stationed in Haiyang Town. He was then reorganized into the 8th Independent Brigade. One month later, he set off for Jiumenkou, reaching the first line of defense and engaging in anti-Japanese warfare.</p>
<h3>River Changes and Reorganization</h3>
<p>Later, Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province, retreated without a fight, and there was no defensible terrain in front. Liang and his comrades retreated from Jiumenkou to Beiping, and were reorganized into the Liaojihei People's Army Support Association Engineering Training Team, stationed at Wanshoushan in Xiyuan for training. Before long, the Tanggu Truce was signed. Feng Yuxiang suddenly rose up in Chahar to resist the Japanese, and the Engineering Training Team also went to Chahar from Beiping to participate. Liang went along, which was his second anti-Japanese campaign.</p>
<h3>Coming to Shanghai for Negotiations</h3>
<p>Subsequently, due to the central government's specific plans for resisting Japan, Feng voluntarily withdrew from Dolun. Liang was ordered to go south to Shanghai to negotiate with various parties. Before leaving, Yao Zirang's niece, Yao Ruifang, specifically introduced her brother, lawyer Yao Zhaoli, and personally wrote a letter, entrusting it to Liang to bring to Shanghai. Liang has now met with lawyer Yao Zhaoli to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Stating Aspirations</h3>
<p>When Liang met with lawyer Yao Zhaoli, he recounted his experiences in resisting Japan and stated that due to various circumstances, his life was very difficult. He intended to rent a rickshaw and pull it on the streets to carry passengers, so that he could eke out a living and wait for the opportunity to resist Japan again in the future. Lawyer Yao repeatedly persuaded him and offered to provide financial assistance, but Liang firmly refused, saying that young people like him should support themselves through labor and should not rely on others.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pulling Life</h3>
<p>Liang has been pulling a rickshaw since yesterday. Lawyer Yao has completed the rental procedures on his behalf. The rickshaw Liang pulls has a concession license number of 4678 and a Chinese area license number of 14678. It belongs to Wang Feihong's rickshaw company. The rent is 65 cents (currency unspecified) per day. However, Liang's residence cannot be announced due to other considerations.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Concert</h3>
<p>Held Tonight at the Grand Theatre</p>
<p>October 29th, Sunday night at 9:15 pm, the Municipal Council Concert will be held at the Grand Theatre. The program is as follows: (1) Romeo and Juliet (Overture) by Tchaikovsky; (2) Afternoon of a Faun by Debussy; (3) Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 2 in A Major (three movements) by Liszt (This piece will be performed by Russian pianist Ada Milikowskaja with the Municipal Council Orchestra); (4) Symphonic Dances (four movements) by Grieg; Intermission; (5) Valses nobles et sentimentales (three pieces) by Ravel, Piano Solo. Ticket prices remain the same, but student discounts were not approved by the Municipal Council because this year's ticket prices are already lower than in previous years, so no further reductions can be made.</p>
<h3>Announcement Regarding the Placement of Submarine Cables</h3>
<p>Gu Lien, Port Director of the Jianghai Customs, issued Announcement No. 19 yesterday regarding the placement of submarine cables in the new waterway: A new submarine cable is currently being laid about 1,900 feet south of the explosives depot on the Pujiang Road Bridge, crossing the new waterway. Warning signs have been erected on the shore at both ends of the cable as identification. Lights will be lit in front of the signs at night. All shipping merchants are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Trial of Former Post Office Savings Bureau Director for Embezzlement; Fifteen Thousand Yuan in Unexplained Accounts; Special Court No. 1 Holds Public Hearing Today</h3>
<p>Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping, former directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, were impeached by the Control Yuan for having 150,000 yuan (currency unspecified) in unexplained accounts under the category of expense reimbursements during their tenure, and were handed over to a nearby court for trial on charges of dereliction of duty, as reported previously in this newspaper. It is now learned that the case has been accepted by Special Court No. 1 and is scheduled for a public hearing at 2:00 PM this month (Monday), October 30th, in the court's Criminal Division No. 8. The defendants have been summoned to appear in court at that time to be interrogated.</p>
<h3>Pudong Residents Strive to Preserve the Old Xidu Wharf; the 27th Branch of the 5th District Petitions the Higher Party Headquarters for Review</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the British company Asiatic Petroleum Company encroaching and merging the old Xidu Wharf in Pudong, the nearby residents, seeing that the gateway to Pudong would be blocked, are extremely indignant. Recently, the company has even hired workers to begin construction. The residents, in a moment of desperation, gathered over a hundred women to the site to stop the construction. The situation at the time was quite serious. For three consecutive days, the two sides persisted. Fortunately, the public security police were able to maintain order and prevent any incidents. Now, the company, seeing that its wishes have not been fulfilled, ordered all workers yesterday to cease blocking construction. Male and female workers working in various cotton mills in North Pudong also took the opportunity to force ferries to carry passengers to and from the wharf, restoring it to its former state. According to insiders, the company is now planning to devise a proper solution, first opening a small road to Pudong at the eastern end of the wharf and building a bridge over the road in its original form, in order to appease the public. However, the public believes that this claim has not been verified and fears that the company will revert to its old ways, so they firmly adhere to their unyielding spirit and fight to the end. Yesterday, they also sent representatives to petition Mr. Pan Zhiwen, a local gentry in Yangjing Town, requesting him to ask Mr. Du Yue, a standing committee member of the Pudong Tongsheng Township Association, for his assistance in achieving the goal of preserving the original state of the old Xidu Wharf. Mr. Pan expressed his acceptance and promised to convey their request. The party branches in the 20th and 27th districts of the 5th district have also separately submitted petitions to the 5th district party headquarters for review after receiving the residents' requests for assistance in preserving the old road. The original petition from the 27th branch is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Petition regarding the Asiatic Petroleum Company Lower Depot Wharf obtaining approval to block the road and merge the newly purchased base, requesting consideration for the Pudong gateway and facilitation of public transportation in order to promote municipal prosperity. It has been found that the Asiatic Petroleum Company Lower Depot Wharf has purchased the vacant land of the Hefeng Shipyard and, under the guise of municipal government approval, has blocked and encroached the original Xidu Wharf, merging it with the new land. This is a legitimate request for a merchant, but it is inappropriate to consider the widening of Xipu Road as a satisfactory condition. Xipu Road originally had an eight-foot road, which has now been widened. Although more than one hundred feet of the Pudong waterfront have been conceded, the former Tanggong Shanhou Bureau submitted a memorandum to the Shanghai County Magistrate on July 15th of the Republic of China, which was forwarded to the Jiangsu Negotiator and the Shanghai Circuit Intendant for review and then transferred to the Junpu Bureau for compliance. Except for Dongjiadu, the remaining areas should be surveyed according to the map, and all places where mud filling and elevation are reported should delineate ten zhang of the Pudong waterfront for public ferries. The established cases are all there, and there is nothing to hide. Furthermore, Xipu Road is five or six li away from the ferry crossing opposite the Meifu Oil Depot. If the Xidu Wharf is blocked, the factory workers in the middle of these two ends will inevitably move to the concession, which will increase the population of the concession. Other various obstacles to the future prosperity of the market, the construction of factories, and the loading and unloading of goods are too numerous to mention. An examination of the concession reveals that a public wharf for entering Pudong has been built every one thousand feet. Now, considering the Yangshupu section, from the Weituoma Road wharf eastward, there are four Pudong wharves at Andong Road, Qiwupu Road, and Lan Road. The intention is to facilitate transportation and promote the market. Can we not pay attention to Pudong? If the authorities are concerned about treaty relations and find it difficult to cancel the approval, then, in any case, a Pudong road and wharf should be left between Asiatic Petroleum Company and Hefeng Shipyard before construction is allowed. Otherwise, the villagers will only care about sovereignty and not know the harm, and accidents are likely to occur, which is very worrying. In order to prevent accidents, the branch cannot remain silent. It has been submitted to the fifth party member congress for discussion, and it has been resolved to submit it to your association for review. Please approve the forwarding, which will be convenient for the party. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3>Hospital or Roulette? A Major Fraud Case of Ten Thousand Yuan Between Chinese and Austrians; One Austrian Detained, One Fled; the French Concession Police Also Accuse the Plaintiff and Defendant of Bribery and Forgery</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, yesterday afternoon, the Second Special District Court of this port rendered a verdict in a major fraud case between Chinese and foreigners. The plaintiff was Chinese Wang Meiting, and the defendants were Austrians Sebersok and Bi Cha. German pharmacist Miller, reporter Sheng Like, and Ms. Tang Jin were also involved as witnesses. The content of the case was extremely complicated. The plaintiff's complaint stated that the two defendants took 100,000 yuan (currency unspecified) on the pretext of jointly opening a hospital, while the defendants claimed that it was not for opening a hospital, but for jointly establishing a roulette gambling house. Because of this, the French Concession Police also filed a complaint, accusing the plaintiff and defendant of public bribery, and accusing the plaintiff of forgery. The French Concession Police's case is to be heard in two weeks. As for the case of Wang Meiting suing Austrians Sebersok and Bi Cha, it was judged yesterday that the first defendant, Sebersok, must return 100,000 yuan (currency unspecified) to the plaintiff and pay a fine of 1,000 yuan (currency unspecified). Because he was unable to pay, he was immediately detained. The court ruled that the fine could be commuted at the rate of three yuan per day of imprisonment. The second defendant, Bi Cha, is on the run, and the police authorities have been ordered to apprehend him. The incident occurred in June of this year. At that time, the plaintiff, Wang Meiting, met the first defendant, Austrian Sebersok, and the second defendant, Austrian Bi Cha, in social circles, and their friendship deepened. Wang wanted to set up a hospital, and Sebersok and Bi Cha also had this idea, so they entered into an agreement to cooperate, with Wang contributing 100,000 yuan (currency unspecified), which was given to Sebersok and Bi Cha to be responsible for the operation. At that time, German doctor Miller, reporter Sheng Like, and Ms. Tang Jin were invited to be witnesses. However, after the two defendants took Wang's 100,000 yuan (currency unspecified), they used evasive language and did not establish a hospital. Wang suspected that something was wrong and began an investigation, and Bi Cha suddenly secretly returned to his country at this time. Sebersok also fabricated a false name and asked the Austrian consulate for a passport to return to his country. Wang was greatly alarmed and immediately filed a lawsuit in court, arresting the first defendant, Sebersok. After several interrogations, Sebersok admitted that Wang had contributed 100,000 yuan (currency unspecified), of which more than 80,000 yuan (currency unspecified) was taken, but it was for jointly setting up a roulette gambling house, not for setting up a hospital. Witness Miller also said that Wang was opening a gambling house and invited him to work there, with a monthly salary of 500 yuan (currency unspecified). He himself did not know what gambling was. In addition, Sheng Like and Ms. Tang Jin testified that the agreement at the time was for the establishment of a hospital. Sheng Like also said that because the languages of the two parties were not clear, he acted as a translator, and what they discussed was purely for the establishment of a hospital. Therefore, the testimonies in this case were conflicting. Until yesterday morning, Judge Wu ascended the bench to render a verdict, fining the first defendant 1,000 yuan (currency unspecified). Since he could not pay, the fine was commuted at the rate of three yuan per day of imprisonment. The second defendant is still being pursued. The police's case is scheduled to be heard in two weeks.</p>

<h3>Pujiang No. 5 Ferry Boat Trial Voyage Yesterday; the Shanghai Ferry Route Extended to Wusong; the Most Exquisite Ferry in East Asia</h3>
<p>Since the city took over the ferry business in this city, it has been very developed due to proper management. Now, the No. 5 ferry boat sailing between Wusong and Tongren Wharf has been completed. Yesterday afternoon, it hosted all sectors of society on the ferry boat, and sailed to Sanjiakou, Wusong at 2:30 pm, and then returned to Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Grandeur of the Trial Voyage</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first trial voyage of the ferry boat. The company invited Chinese and Western people from this port to participate, accompanied by the Public Security Bureau military band. Those present included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Director of the Finance Bureau Cai Zengji, Director of the Public Works Bureau Xu Peihuang, Director of the Navigation Bureau Zhu Yaoting, Director of the International Telephone Bureau City Ferry No. 5</p>
<p>Wen Yuqing, Executive Director of Xingye Trust Company Wu Yunzhai, Director of the City Treasury Wu Zixiang, City Government Secretaries Tang Shixuan, Chen Kecheng, Geng Jiaji, Wang Shaozhai, Chief of the General Affairs Office of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Xu Yuanfang, Municipal Council Member He De Kui Tan Shaoliang, Secretary of the Two Roads Management Bureau Qin Hancai, and more than two hundred reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers. The ferry boat first docked at the Tongren Wharf on the Bund, Nanjing Road at 10:00 AM. After the guests signed in, each was given a photo of the new ferry boat by the ushers as a souvenir. At 2:30 PM, the music started and the boat departed, followed by the cross-river ferry boats operated by the company at both ends. It passed the various docks without stopping, reaching Wusong in only 3:40. On the way back, the company specially prepared exquisite refreshments to entertain the guests. It returned to the Tongren Wharf at 5:00. The sky was high and the air was crisp that day, and the guests enjoyed the autumn scenery of the Pujiang River and returned with pleasure.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Visit</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and others arrived at the Tongren Wharf at 1:00 PM and were accompanied by Tan Boying, Director of the Municipal Ferry Administration, to board the ferry boat for a visit, especially the first and second class cabins and the engine room. Mayor Wu praised the exquisite equipment and clean layout of the ferry boat. He then had some refreshments in the first-class cabin before leaving. It is said that the ferry boat is the only exquisite ferry boat in East Asia.</p>
<h3>Origins of Construction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Xingye Trust Company, which manages the Pujiang River ferries in this city, has spared no effort in expanding and improving them. There are now no fewer than a dozen new ferry boats, large and small, which are convenient for travelers on both sides of the Pujiang River. Currently, the only long ferry line runs from the Tongren Wharf in Shanghai through Xidu Qing Temple, etc., to Donggou and Gaoqiao. The traffic in the Youchi area, Laoshusha, and Wusong, which are designated by the municipal government, is still inconvenient. Therefore, the company spent a large sum of 150,000 yuan (currency unspecified) to add a No. 5 large ferry boat to the existing four long ferry boats, extending the route to Wusong and completing the transportation construction of the northern section of the Pujiang River.</p>
<h3>Construction Overview</h3>
<p>The ferry boat is 120 feet long, 21 feet wide, 9.5 feet deep, and has a draft of 5.5 feet. It has a displacement of 195 tons and is powered by a six-cylinder, 334-horsepower diesel engine, with a speed of 12 nautical miles. It can carry 600 passengers. The lower level is the second-class cabin, all with reclining chairs, painted with first-class Beijing lacquer. Each seat has triangular wooden strips to prevent passengers from lying down. The light and air are very sufficient, which is unmatched by any other river boat. The front part of the middle level is the first-class cabin with seats, all made of teak. The chair backs are made according to the curve of the human back. The rear part is the second-class loose cabin, which also carries goods. The upper level is the special-class cabin, located in the middle, with a wine counter made of Italian marble. There is a heating stove in winter, which uses the heat from the diesel engine to increase the temperature in the cabin. The exquisite interior decoration is no less than that of foreign ocean-going ships. Even the smallest clothes hook has its own special advantages. The door and window switches and door locks are all custom-made by a famous German factory that imitates those used in the Berlin subway. The deck is made of teak and polished by machine. In terms of safety, there are sufficient lifebuoys and life rafts. The fire-fighting equipment, in addition to fire extinguishing chemicals, is also equipped with fire hydrants on each floor, which can be said to be double safety. In terms of technology, the whole boat is full of water lines. The lower part is equipped with two eight-inch wide water floating roads. Even when fully loaded with passengers, there is no risk of tilting. The bow of the ship adopts the latest warship style. If it does not collide with other ships, there is no risk of the lower part of the waterline being hit. The ship's hull is streamline, shaped like a fish's back. This is the first time it has been used in the Eastern shipbuilding industry. Its advantages are that it is easy to turn and it increases the speed of travel. Overall, the equipment of the ship is such that the first-class and second-class cabins are clean and simple, suitable for ordinary passengers. The special-class cabin is refined, elegant, and beautiful, suitable for tourists. In fact, it can meet the needs of various types of passengers. This is the special advantage of the ferry boat.</p>
<h3>The Male Child's Corpse in Longhua Was an Elementary School Student; His Mother Claimed the Corpse and Coffin Yesterday; the Reason for the Murder Is Unknown</h3>
<p>A report was made in this paper regarding the discovery of the murdered boy, with lacerations to his head, chest, abdomen and feet, on the vacant land of the Xuanjia Residence of Longhua Cement Factory on the night of the 25th of this month, which prompted the District Court to examine and collect evidence. It is learned that Ding Yin, wife of the late Ding A'san of Wuxi, age 49, went to the Ninth District Bao Wu Jixsheng's office yesterday morning, who accompanied her to the District Court to claim the body. Her family operates the Ding Juxing San Ji Iron Shop on Xiaoshadu Road, Kangding Road, and their business is quite prosperous. Her family also owns more than 20 mu of land. After her husband's death, she was left with an only son named Ding Fugen, age 13. Because he was studying recently, he was enrolled at the Baxianqiao Law School. Because it was inconvenient to travel back and forth, he lived at the Zhang Yuxing Iron Shop opened by his uncle Zhang Genfa at No. 123 Laohai Road. After school every day, he never went out. On the afternoon of the 25th of this month, he did not return home after school. The family searched everywhere without success, so they posted a reward of 100 yuan (currency unspecified) to find him. Her son was wearing a half-new dark blue long gown, a dark green velvet vest, a faux wool gabardine trousers, and basketball shoes. And seeing the report that the day the boy was murdered in Longhua was the same day her son went missing, and the clothes and age matched, she requested permission to claim the corpse and coffin, and to apprehend and prosecute the murderer. She also claimed that there were no threatening letters before her son went missing, and no ransom letters afterwards, so it was not a kidnapping. And the child had no enemies, and she did not know why anyone would want to cut off her family's lineage, which caused her unbearable pain. She was given a preliminary hearing by Prosecutor Yang An, who immediately ordered the Bao to accompany her to identify and claim the corpse and coffin, pending investigation and thorough examination.</p>
<h3>Arrest of the Murderer of Tang Jiapeng, Former Manager of the Great World; The Mastermind and Main Culprit Are Still at Large</h3>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, a native of Ningbo and 44 years old, was the former manager of the Great World amusement park, residing at No. 3, Wufuli, Luzon Road, in the French Concession. On June 18th of this year, around 1:00 AM, Tang was preparing to return home from the Great World. As soon as he exited the amusement park's main gate and stepped onto his Austin car (French Concession License No. 7065), his chauffeur, Xu Arong, was about to start the engine when a group of thugs suddenly jumped out from the crowd by the roadside and opened fire indiscriminately. Tang was hit by five bullets all over his body. By the time the car reached Baolong Hospital, he had already succumbed to his injuries and died en route. A stray bullet also killed Wu Guangcai, a Yangzhou bath attendant (33 years old) who scrubbed backs at the Jiquan Bathhouse in Beichujiaqiao. The details were reported in this newspaper. Since the incident, the French police have attached great importance to it, repeatedly instructing all detectives to solve the case within a time limit. However, after the incident, the perpetrators, realizing that the search was too intense and knowing it would be difficult to remain in this city, fled to other areas to avoid detection. The detectives handling the case, although aware that these people had fled far away, feared that tracking and arresting them would be counterproductive. Therefore, they remained calm and eased the situation, knowing that their escape was only temporary and that they would eventually return to Shanghai. As expected, yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, Inspector-General Jin Jiulin suddenly received a confidential report from his subordinates stating that Zhang Xiaosizi, a suspect in the case, had secretly returned to Shanghai and was hiding somewhere on Haifang Road in the International Settlement. He requested immediate arrest. Inspector-General Jin immediately led Detective Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, Deputy Detective Zhou Yaoting, Detectives Xu Guilin, Cui Zhenguo, and Chinese and foreign detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station, and drove to No. 648, Haifang Road, to the Tiger Stove shop. Zhang was inside drinking tea and was arrested. Taken to the police station for interrogation, Zhang confessed that he was 26 years old, from Funing, and had previously served as a member of the Jiangbei Security Corps. He admitted that the killing of Tang was commissioned by someone else. On the day of the attack, they had rented Room No. 8 at the Asia Hotel at 135 Avenue Edward VII, where more than ten people planned the murder. The first plan was to disguise themselves as small vendors selling pancakes, fruit, and other items and kill Tang at his house in Wufuli, Luzon Road. However, due to the long-term presence of gatekeepers and police at the entrance of the alley, it was difficult to carry out. Therefore, they decided to change their plan and attack him at the entrance of the Great World, where there would be a dense crowd of people in the evening, with many tourists, making it easier to escape. That night, he and his accomplices Wang Jinkui and Zhou Ermujiang, each carrying a pistol, went to the Great World. When Tang came out, Wang Jinkui fired three shots at him first. Seeing that Tang was still not dead and trying to escape, Zhou Ermujiang fired six more shots. After achieving their goal, they fled back to the Asia Hotel and hid on Haifang Road until his arrest. According to the police, since the mastermind is still at large, the authorities have ordered all detectives to rigorously pursue the main culprit and bring him to justice for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Robbery on Haig Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At the home of Zhu Genfa, No. 46, Zhujiazhai, Haig Road, Shanghai West, around 2:00 AM yesterday, three robbers suddenly appeared, all speaking with a Shandong accent. One of the robbers drew a pistol, warning them to remain silent, and looted at will for about a quarter of an hour before escaping with their stolen goods. The stolen items included more than a dozen items of winter and summer clothing. The victim filed a report with the Sixth District Public Security Bureau requesting investigation.</p>
<h3>Policeman Accidentally Touches Young Woman, Fiancé Becomes Jealous and Attacks the Policeman; Both Parties Involved in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Yuan Axin, a 16-year-old young woman residing at No. 29, Pingyangli, Avenue Haig, International Settlement, was walking near the intersection of Route Ghisi and Avenue Foch in the French Concession around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday. Because a car was approaching, the Chinese policeman No. 358 stationed there raised his hand to stop Yuan from proceeding. The policeman's arm accidentally touched Yuan's shoulder, leading to an argument. Suddenly, the woman's fiancé, He Xiaomei, without asking any questions, punched the policeman in the back of the head and fled towards the Chinese territory. Police officer No. 1162 from the Second District Public Security Bureau in the Chinese territory helped to apprehend He and brought him to the police station. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer stated that the defendant assaulted a public servant performing his duties, violating Article 142 of the Criminal Code, and requested that he be interrogated according to the law. He Xiaomei testified that the policeman was flirting with his fiancée, as had been rumored, but he did not intend to commit violence. He hired attorney Gu Jirong to defend him. Judge Sun reviewed the testimony and ordered the defendant to post a 300-yuan security deposit for bail and scheduled another hearing with the policeman summoned to testify.</p>
<h3>Editorial Outline of "A Grand View of Shanghai," Compiled by Zhou Shixun at the Request of the Wenhua Company</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Shixun, editor of the Wenhua Fine Arts Publishing and Printing Company's film monthly, has recently compiled a book titled "A Grand View of Shanghai." The book, with over 200 pages, is entirely photographic and showcases all aspects of Shanghai as designed and categorized by Mr. Zhou for the Chinese audience. Each photograph includes detailed explanations, or historical accounts of famous landmarks. To facilitate foreign tourists visiting China, the explanations are translated into simple English. The book contains approximately 1,000 photographs, printed with three-color, two-color, and single-color halftone plates on high-quality paper. The editorial outline and table of contents are divided into four categories: Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation, with over 100 subcategories. Each category features approximately ten photographs, such as the grandeur of Greater Shanghai, the municipal administration of the Chinese territory, the municipal administration and police of the International Settlement, major institutions in Shanghai, universities, girls' schools, transportation, historical sites, etc. These are all sufficient to make readers feel the greatness of the sea. Additionally, topics such as Shanghai's strange events and places, Shanghai's contradictory psychology, and the path to Shanghai's downfall can all provide readers with profound warnings. Other topics such as the introduction of hotels, restaurants, and amusement parks, as well as seasonal entertainment in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, provide detailed guidance, while simultaneously implying how to avoid being taken advantage of. In short, while there are many guidebooks for Shanghai, there has never been a guide to Shanghai that emphasizes both text and images. "A Grand View of Shanghai" is the first of its kind. The book has now been fully compiled and will be printed soon. Readers from all over have been eagerly pre-ordering it from the company, and wholesale orders from Southeast Asia are particularly active, indicating the need for this type of book among readers in distant places. According to Mr. Zhou, the book's editor, the entire compilation process has long been completed, but the collection of a large amount of material had to be postponed by half a month. This time, he can guarantee on-time publication. The address of Wenhua Publishing is at the intersection of Henan Road and Sijing Road. The book is priced at three yuan per copy, with an 80% discount for pre-orders.</p>

<h3>Two Major Principles of Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>— Mu Ouchu</p>
<p>Humans are born with a group and therefore born with a social life. When humans began to engage in social life, "division of labor" also occurred.</p>
<p>Division of labor is the most important means to increase production capacity and is a means to unleash infinite and great production capacity. This is undoubtedly a fact. Henry Ford, the American automobile king, once said, "Further division of labor is the key to increasing production." Economist Adam Smith also regarded division of labor as the first element in increasing national wealth in his famous book "The Wealth of Nations." He cited the division of labor in the needle-making industry as an example, saying that division of labor can increase a person's productivity by 4,800 times, and recently, some people have said that division of labor can increase human power by tens of thousands, or even millions of times.</p>
<p>Under the ancient large family system, the division of labor based on gender has been confirmed by economic historians. However, this division of labor occurs due to the natural necessity of human life, so the increase in its productivity is limited and cannot be unlimited. As for the more concrete initial division of labor, it is based on occupation, that is, the work that used to be done by one person is first divided into carpenters, blacksmiths, merchants, etc., becoming a specialized occupation. The more developed the economy, the tighter this occupational division of labor becomes.</p>
<p>This division of labor method can be roughly divided into two categories: one is the same occupation, but because the items they manufacture are different, they each specialize in what they manufacture. For example, carpenters are divided into carpenters who build houses, carpenters who build ships, and carpenters who do fine work. The other is to divide a production process that used to be done by one person into several manufacturing processes, each engaging in a part of the work, such as spinning, weaving, and dyeing. Further division of labor then leads to each person only doing a part of the work. Dozens or hundreds of people each perform different tasks, which can then complete an overall operation.</p>
<p>To make it easier to understand, the progress of division of labor and its differentiation methods are shown in the diagram below:</p>
<p>Occupational Division of Labor</p>
<p>Life 丨 Undifferentiated Labor 　　　　　　　　 Specialized Technical Division of Labor</p>
<p>Occupational 　　Occupational 　　Technical Division of Labor</p>
<p>Division of Labor</p>
<p>Productive 　　Technical Division of Labor</p>
<p>Division of Labor 　　Technical Division of Labor</p>
<p>Now, let me illustrate this with an example. Taking housing as an example, if we want to build a house, we must first have ordinary construction workers, and then we must gather carpenters, plasterers, and other kinds of workers. Among the carpenters, in addition to ordinary carpenters, there are also specialized fine carpenters. If we consider the aspect of goods, the wood processed by the carpenters must have loggers and transporters as its source, as well as trains, ships, and lumber companies that saw the wood into planks, and transportation companies that transport the planks, as well as various other merchants. In the train, ship, and lumber companies, there are various specialized workers, and these train, ship, and lumber companies are all formed by integrating the labor of thousands of people in various specialized fields. Housing is like this, and other things such as clothing and food are no different. Only in this way can each production be carried out in accordance with economic principles. Through the accumulation of these products, our cultural life is becoming more and more advanced. Therefore, division of labor is the foundation of human cultural life.</p>
<p>Although division of labor is the foundation of human cultural life, there is another important condition that we should not neglect. This condition is the adjustment of each part. In other words, after division of labor, how can we ensure that there are no contradictions or conflicts between the separate tasks, and how can we give them the most reasonable and purposeful connection? This question is the most important. Today's scientific management methods, industrial rationalization, and even the so-called controlled economy are all aimed at solving this problem and promoting methods. Let us now further elaborate on the issue of adjusting each part. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Regulations for Normal Schools and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a request from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education for clarification regarding ambiguities in the regulations for Hangzhou Normal School and Provincial High Schools. Instructions for clarification were issued, but the original text was not published. Now, similar situations and questions have arisen in various provinces. The Ministry of Education's previous clarifications to the Zhejiang Department of Education are extracted below: (1) Boarding students at the secondary school are permitted to be exempt from evening self-study, but the school should devise methods for supervision and examination, and submit them to the Department of Education for review. (2) Starting from 1933, all graduating students must adhere to the secondary school regulations and participate in graduation examinations. (3) Students enrolled before 1933 must also comply with Articles 50 to 65 of the secondary school regulations. (4) Article 62 of the secondary school regulations, which states that "all should be demoted to the lower semester's class for study," simply means what is commonly referred to as repeating a grade. (5) Article 63 of the secondary school regulations, which states that "continue to audit courses with the original class," refers to students who have passed all subjects in that grade and are auditing courses in the same grade. (6) Article 63 of the secondary school regulations, which states "simultaneously seek ways to remediate the relevant subjects," the subjects for remediation are not limited to outside of class time within the teaching schedule, but also allows for free remediation. The supplementary exams for failed subjects can be moved to a few days before the next semester for flexible arrangements. The same article refers to students who fail one subject's supplementary exam. Repeating a grade non-consecutively is not subject to the "limited to one time" rule. (7) For students starting in the spring semester, Article 69 of the secondary school regulations already stipulates that the average of the student's grades for the upper and lower semesters should still be used as the student's academic year grade, and the academic year grade must be reported when submitting the student's academic performance report. (8) Article 64 of the secondary school regulations has a provision for those who fail the graduation examination, "should be required to repeat a grade for one academic year." However, given that the school has complete grades starting in both the spring and autumn semesters, it can be specially permitted to change this to repeating a grade for one semester. As for the remedial coursework methods after repeating a grade, the school can consider the situation and provide opportunities for remedial classes for failed subjects, without requiring every subject to be taken in the third academic year.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Section Chief Wu Yan Visits Hubei and Hunan to Inspect Education</h3>
<p>Of the twelve inspectors dispatched by the Ministry of Education, eleven have already gone to various provinces and cities to inspect the state of education, as previously reported. Director Gu Shusen, who inspected education in Shanghai, returned to Beijing on the 26th and went to the Ministry of Education to work on the morning of the 27th. However, due to a temporary matter for the Minister, Director Gu, together with the Section Chief of the Higher Education Department, must still go to Shanghai in the coming days to inspect the National Jinan University and other schools, and will stay for several days. Therefore, Section Chief Wu Yan will not depart for his inspection until the end of this month (or November 1st if the ship schedule is not precise). It is heard that Mr. Wu will first go to Changsha and inspect Hunan for twenty days, then go to Hubei and inspect for about three weeks before returning to Beijing. This inspection will focus on the determination of educational administration plans and concrete methods for primary and secondary schools, rather than making abstract examinations of schools.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Association Oversees Private Schools in the Capacity of All Supervisors and Directors</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Education Association launched the one-yuan-one-month education campaign, it has established sixteen community schools in various factory areas of the city. In order to facilitate the supervision of each school, the association sent a letter to all supervisors and directors yesterday, stating: Dear Sir/Madam, Our association has established seventeen community schools, one after another. It is necessary to supervise them from time to time to see whether each school can be managed seriously. However, the schools are scattered in various districts, and the area is vast. Sending staff for inspection would be too much for too few people and it would be easy to not cover everything. In order to improve educational efficiency, we plan to have colleagues jointly oversee and supervise. If the schools are located near your place of employment, please provide guidance from time to time. An address list of the factory schools is attached. Please refer to it.</p>

Those who arrived late could not see the entire picture and insisted on a repeat screening. The association, in view of the Pudong public's enthusiasm for educational films, screened them again until 8:00 PM before returning to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The Uneven Distribution of Talent Leads Youyou to Lose to Banque de l'Indochine: A Score of Four to Eight; The Assembled Stars of Banque de l'Indochine Prove to be Formidable Opponents</h3>
<p>Since Jiang Shanqing, Chen Jiaqiu, Zhong Yongsen, and Liang Shutang, along with four warriors from Jinan, joined Youyou, the Youyou lineup has been refreshed and its strength enhanced. However, unfortunately, in their first match of the West League yesterday, they encountered the formidable Banque de l'Indochine and suffered a setback, losing by a score of four to eight. The referee was Botto.</p>
<h3>Banque de l'Indochine Lineup</h3>
<p>Garnier, J. Walter</p>
<p>Boggis, B. Huot</p>
<p>Fulu Shou, Pike, Collet</p>
<p>Nicolas Leff, W. Walter</p>
<p>Remédi, Favrel</p>
<h3>Youyou Lineup</h3>
<p>Liang Shutang, Li Shuoyou</p>
<p>Wang Shusen, Sun Jinshun</p>
<p>Wang Caigao, Huang Ruihua, Hu Youcheng</p>
<p>Jiang Shanqing, Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Shi Jinsheng, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<h3>The Youyou Lineup Still Needs Improvement</h3>
<p>Jiang Shanqing as the inner defender, Liang Shutang as the forward, Chen Jiaqiu as the inner striker, and Zhong Yongsen as the right winger are all outstanding players. Coupled with Youyou's original strength, they should be able to compete with Banque de l'Indochine. However, they ended up losing by a score of eight to four, indicating that their lineup and defense urgently need improvement. The collapse of the center-back line yesterday was the team's fatal weakness. Huang Ruihua is old, Shi Jinsheng lacks the strength, and Liang Shutang is isolated and helpless. With the center line failing, the inner defenders were extremely busy, and Wang Caigao bore the brunt, greatly disappointing everyone. At the same time, the central leader of the five forwards failed to achieve the effect of connected arms, resulting in twice the effort with half the result. Youyou has been making progress in recent years and should not ignore this point in order to live up to the audience's expectations.</p>
<h3>The Strength of Banque de l'Indochine is Surprisingly Remarkable</h3>
<p>Banque de l'Indochine has a concentration of talent and a well-organized lineup. They have previously played against the Shanghai Municipal Team and the Hong Kong Team, and observers do not underestimate them despite their losses, considering them to be a strong team in this year's West League. The team is based on the original personnel of Banque de l'Indochine, absorbing famous players from the West, Portugal, and Lux teams, creating a hybrid that can dominate everything. Their victory over Youyou was within their expectations. Judging from their performance yesterday, their rushing, passing, and shooting were all excellent, with only the left inner defender having some shortcomings. When they take the stage again in the future, they will be truly impeccable.</p>
<h3>Gains and Losses Within Five Minutes</h3>
<p>Youyou kicked off at the beginning of the day, but their progress was unfavorable, and martial law was declared in front of the goal. A ball suddenly broke out of the encirclement, and Zhong Yongsen charged into the array alone. Boggis fell for the trick, and Zhong made a well-placed pass. Shuoyou met the ball in front of the goal and successfully scored. Overjoyed, the enemy soldiers invaded, and Favrel moved from the right to the center, and Collet lightly headed the ball in. The goalkeeper could not defend both sides, and the ball also went in. It was difficult to gain a point, but too easy to lose one. This is why Youyou's morale was low. Chen Jiaqiu and Zhong Yongsen exchanged passes and played well, but the opponent's goalkeeper, Fulu Shou, was indeed skilled and made several desperate saves, which was not easy to overcome. At that time, their momentum was still strong, and if the central players had eyes at their feet, they could have scored at least one or two goals.</p>
<h3>Four Goals Lost Mysteriously</h3>
<p>With Banque de l'Indochine's interior as solid as a fortress and their five forwards as lively as dragons and tigers, Youyou had no choice but to adopt a conservative strategy. Wang Caigao was surrounded and at a loss. Initially, he received help from Jiang and Liang, but he could not hold on. As soon as his spirit waned, the lineup became chaotic. B. Huot broke into the center alone (two to one). Remédi sent a long ball, and Wang Caigao panicked and shot the ball into his own goal. Banque de l'Indochine took a three-to-one lead. From then on, the gate was wide open, and the enemy continued to invade. Walter, the left winger, then scored a goal, and Favrel, the right winger, also made a great contribution. Sun Jinshun led his team in a counterattack and, with great effort, snatched a goal from the enemy, making the score five to two, with Banque de l'Indochine leading at halftime.</p>
<h3>Efforts to Manuever Proved Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Although Youyou was behind, their morale was still strong, and Banque de l'Indochine was in a trapped position. Zhong and Li on the wings made contributions from time to time. Once, Zhong attacked himself, and the goalkeeper dived to catch the ball. Another time, he lobbed the ball in front of the goal, and Hu Youcheng competed with the goalkeeper. Li Shuoyou faced an empty goal but lobbed the ball over the post. Sun Jinshun dribbled the ball again and attacked, and Zhong passed the ball in again. Li Shuoyou finally lived up to expectations and made the score three to five. Just as they began to smile, tragedy struck again. Walter and Collet each scored another goal, making the score three to seven. Then, the general Jiang Shanqing suddenly left the field due to an ankle injury, and all hope of a comeback was extinguished. Liang Shutang bravely took on the important position of inner defender and fought hard against the strong enemy. Pike committed a foul at the fifteen-yard mark, and Sun and Zhong shot with their iron legs. The goalkeeper got the ball but lost it again, making the score four to seven. However, in the blink of an eye, Collet scored another goal, resulting in the final score of eight to four.</p>
<h3>The Zhongzi Team of the Chinese Football Association, Fudan, Defeated Xingguang Yesterday: A Score of Three to Zero</h3>
<p>The Zhongzi Team of the Chinese Football Association kicked off yesterday, with Fudan facing Xingguang in the first match. Fudan has a balanced team and is one of the best university teams in Shanghai. They have had good results in the Chinese Football Association over the years. Xingguang is also a mediocre team. The competition between the two teams was quite interesting. Both sides were heavily guarded in the first half, and incidents were seen from time to time. Both teams were able to maintain the status quo. Fudan scored a goal by Yu Shunzhang, taking a one-to-zero lead. In the second half, Fudan's momentum was still strong, and Xingguang tried hard to resist, missing many opportunities. Later, their lineup relaxed, and Lin Bingcheng and Li Changchi of Fudan successively scored another goal. As a result, Fudan won by a score of three to zero.</p>
<p>Fudan</p>
<p>Zhong Hanqing (Up)</p>
<p>Lu Zhiming (Up), Li Changchi (Up), Li Changchi (Down)</p>
<p>Zhang Rong (Down), Lu Xiuwen (Down), Lin Bingcheng</p>

<h3>Closing Meeting of the National Games to be Held</h3>
<p>After the closing of the National Games, all closing matters after the meeting are urgently needed to be discussed. It is reported that the association will seek the consent of the director of preparation, Chu Minyi, and then schedule a meeting (approximately next Tuesday, October 31) to discuss the closing matters, and designate a group to compile the general report of the National Games.</p>
<h3>National Games to Return Site at End of Month; Preparations for Establishment of a Sports Academy and Memorial Park; Request to Borrow from the Memorial Park Management Committee</h3>
<p>After the closing of the Fifth National Games, the various groups of the Organizing Committee moved back to the Ministry of Education on the 22nd and are currently rushing to complete the closing work, which can be completed in half a month. Regarding the transfer of the Central Stadium, according to reporters' inquiries to the Organizing Committee, when the National Games borrowed the site from the Memorial Park Management Committee of the Prime Minister, it was agreed to officially return it by the end of October. The venue and equipment have been largely cleaned up and are expected to be handed over on schedule. Regarding the future application of the sports field, since the next National Games has been decided to be held in Shanghai, there are still four years before the Seventh National Games. If the site is shelved, it would be too uneconomical. In order to save expenses, the Ministry of Education plans to establish a sports school in the Memorial Park, using the field to train sports professionals, so as to achieve two goals at once. However, this is still in the planning stage and needs to be discussed with the Memorial Park Management Committee for a final decision.</p>

<h3>New "On Teachers"</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Confucius had the saying, "One should not yield to benevolence." Teachers are indeed not entirely worthy of respect. Mencius was ridiculed for being fond of being a teacher. Teachers are also not necessarily valuable. Han Yu once claimed that there was no Zhongni in the world, so he should not be in the ranks of disciples. When discussing articles and doctrines, he solemnly regarded himself as a teacher of his generation. However, when I read his essay "On Teachers," I reached the point where I said that there is a sequence in hearing the Tao, and there are specialized studies in art. Disciples do not necessarily have to be inferior to teachers, and teachers do not necessarily have to be better than disciples. I have never doubted his grand theories and comprehensive knowledge. The Great Dai Ritual says, "There are three foundations of rituals: Heaven and earth are the foundation of life, ancestors are the foundation of lineage, and rulers and teachers are the foundation of governance." Even today, people still worship "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parent, Teacher," which shows how respected teachers are. Why are teachers so respected? It is because Heaven sent down the people, making them rulers and teachers. The doctrine of rulers and teachers is the reason.</p>
<p>In my hometown, boxing masters often do not teach their disciples all their skills, calling it "secret fist." In other hundred crafts and skills, teachers do not "leave a trick up their sleeve" for their disciples. Looking back at our own way, there are also instances of teachers and students being jealous of each other. The Forest of Language says that Ma Rong's calculation of the celestial sphere did not match, so he summoned Zheng Xuan and ordered him to calculate it once, and it was immediately determined. When Xuan completed his studies and returned home, Rong was jealous. Xuan also suspected that there were pursuers, so he sat under the bridge, with his clogs on the water. Rong indeed sent someone to pursue him. Afterwards, he told his subordinates, "Xuan is sitting on wood above the water under the earth. He will surely die." So he stopped the pursuit. If that were the case, this would be an example of a teacher being jealous of his disciple. It is said that Zhang Changshi learned Wu painting but failed and became a cursive script writer, and Yan Lugong learned Zhang's cursive script but failed and became a real script writer. These are good examples of disciples being jealous of their teachers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wei Mengke previously published an article in Free Talk criticizing "A Certain Society's Book Exhibition." That society then published a notice in the advertisement section of Free Talk, implying that Mengke should not lightly disparage his teacher. In my opinion, Mengke Mengjin may have words that belittle his teacher; if the person who published this notice is indeed his teacher, it seems that there is a hidden jealousy of his disciple. I do not know if Mengke will write an article to thank his teacher, as Zhang Taiyan did to Yu Quyuan, or Zhou Zuoren did to Zhang Taiyan.</p>
<h3>On "Encirclement"</h3>
<p>— Huaiqiu</p>
<p>When I was a child studying in elementary school, one day school was dismissed especially early. My father, who had never come to school, suddenly came to pick me up. I was certainly not a prodigy, although I felt that the situation was a bit different, but I didn't nervously feel that there was a serious and tense situation coming. As soon as I saw my father, I couldn't help but run up and grab his hand, while the other hand was still holding a ball. But my father didn't hug me as kindly as he did at home, and pulled me away. On the street, the people walking were still the same, but they were walking especially fast. Some people seemed to be running laps. The shops on both sides were all closed. One or two people were poking their heads out and looking through the cracks in the doors. I asked my father why the shops were closed (usually the shops only close at night), but my father didn't answer me, he just kept pulling me away. Just as we got home, my uncle told my father, "The armies of the other side of the river and Yuangia River have encircled us." (At that time, we lived in a city on the west bank of the river, and the Yuangia River was upstream). After a while, there was a burst of gunfire. We were "encircled."</p>
<p>That's how I learned about encirclement. Later, when I was learning about fighting at school, I often used this method of encirclement, taking sticks and bamboo strips to capture my companions' children.</p>
<p>This kind of encirclement with force from all directions probably existed in ancient times. I don't remember the ancient history very well, but I am familiar with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Liu Bei, Zhou Yu, and Cao Cao all seemed to have used this method.</p>
<p>Although using force to encircle can be sure of victory, it is very troublesome to mobilize troops and deploy formations. Therefore, clever modern people have opened up another path to "encirclement."</p>
<p>It's not necessary to cite things from a long time ago. Everyone probably still remembers the campaign to suppress the two northern warlords a few years ago. At that time, the northern army was killing its way south in a mighty manner, and although the southern army had elite troops and sufficient food, it seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. At that time, our young general was still in Shenyang, in the current puppet state of Manchukuo, observing the situation. The overwhelmed side wanted to invite him to enter the pass and implement an "encirclement." Unfortunately, the young general was quite tired of mobilizing troops. Although messengers came and went, tempting him with benefits and persuading him with righteousness, he was still lazy and not enthusiastic. In the end, the southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉he southern military advisors were厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厲害厉</p>
<p>After we decided to resist Japan for a long time, quite a few important or secondary Japanese figures came to China to "visit" or "visit old friends." Recently, even more have been going south and north. Although they are not going as a "full team," the total number of these few times and those few times is quite considerable. The Japanese are always good at imitating. Could it be that our secret encirclement method has been learned by them and they want to use it to encircle us once?</p>
<h3>Breakout</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhicun</p>
<p>(1) Whenever I write argumentative articles when I am emotional, I always feel good when I write them, but I inevitably regret them after they are published. I have never had a "meaningless" or "meaningful" argument with anyone. Unfortunately, "Free Talk" provoked my first emotional article. After it was published, I felt a little regret. Although I am nearly middle-aged, I still hate that my childishness has not been shed. But I have been silent until today. Counting the articles about me that I have cut out, from Mr. Gao Zhi's "Knowing Characters and Using Characters" to Mr. Feng Zhiyu's "Correcting Errors in Vain," there are already more than a dozen. Glued on a book, they can actually become a "Collection of Encirclement." I am like a prisoner who has been imprisoned for literary crimes, reading the newspaper every day in the dark prison cell about my crimes. Today, I can't help but want to break out of prison. I am a little unwilling to be surrounded by those literary formations that are besieging me, so I want to break out. Hence, I write "Breakout."</p>
<p>Right: Title Explanation</p>
<p>(2) When I was filling out the questionnaire for the Dawan Newspaper, I was thinking about the fact that we don't have enough single characters. For example, when we translate foreign books, there are many words that we often can't translate. When we look up X Han Dictionary, we often find annotations like "the square wood on the beam," "the horizontal wood between the windows," and "the appearance of a slow-flowing stream." If there is no appropriate Chinese word or phrase to translate, it is often redundant. Also, we often need to use many synonymous adjectives or verbs in a passage, and we suffer if our vocabulary is not large enough. Because of this motivation, with my ignorance, I wrote a "Literary Anthology." I certainly believe that there are many characters or words in the "Literary Anthology" that can be reapplied in our vernacular writing. As for those characters that really cannot be revived, I admit that they are already dead. As for the book "Zhuangzi," I personally like it very much. It uses all kinds of metaphors to express a meaning. Young people who want to learn to write the best explanatory writing can really learn a little from this book. The above is my original intention in daring to recommend "Zhuangzi and the Literary Anthology," but of course I cannot say separately that "Zhuangzi" is the grammar for writing and the "Literary Anthology" is the reader.</p>
<p>Also, I once introduced the three books "Analects," "Mencius," and "Yan's Family Instructions" to young people to learn about moral cultivation. I couldn't find a book that I could completely accept from the first word to the last word to introduce to young people. Every book has suitable and unsuitable parts. I think these three books are generally still worth reading, especially "Yan's Family Instructions." Yan Zhitui's views are not pedantic, nor is he an unreachable moralist. When I read his "Family Instructions," I never feel as bitter as when I read "Mr. Zhu Bailu's Family Management Proverbs," so I also hope that young people will read it.</p>
<p>On the form in the Dawan Newspaper, I also filled in two books. One is an English book, "Principles of Literary Criticism," a work by Professor Licharts, who advocates experimental criticism from a psychological analysis perspective; and the other is "Buddha's Biography," a biography. These two book titles were filled in the "Books I am Reading Now" column, not to introduce to others.</p>
<p>Right: I have stated my original intentions</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Gao Zhi's article explained four opinions: (1) "Middle school students' vocabulary is small, it is not necessarily because they know few characters... Knowing many characters does not necessarily mean that they will use them." (2) We recognize many vocabularies sometimes for reading ancient books... It does not necessarily have to be expressed in the article." (3) Today's articles are gradually adopting foreign methods. (4) Instead of having middle school students read Zhuangzi and the Literary Anthology, it is better to use this effort on the training of thought and concepts and the increase of new knowledge.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, I also think so, but conversely, we cannot say, "Knowing more characters does not necessarily mean that they will use them, so there is no need to know more characters." For example, if someone knows a hundred characters, he must be able to use one or two before he knows the one hundred and first character. This is unreasonable. Another example is Mr. Shen Congwen. He has read extensively and knows four thousand characters, but when he writes novels, he uses only three thousand characters. If Mr. Gao Zhi does not read the books that Mr. Shen Congwen read, but only reads Mr. Shen Congwen's books, then he knows three thousand characters, and he will use two thousand characters. How can this be? The same is true for vocabulary and writing. When I talk about young people, I am referring to young people who can read "Zhuangzi and the Literary Anthology," not just middle school students. If I say middle school students, then junior high school students are not enough to talk about this, and there should be several senior high school students who can be counted in.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, I think it should be changed: "We have become knowledgeable because we have read ancient books. Although it does not necessarily have to be expressed in the article, it can be applied when it is needed."</p>
<p>Regarding the third point, I still don't quite understand it. Does it mean that after an article adopts foreign methods, even the words become foreign words?</p>
<p>Regarding the fourth point, I have nothing to say either. I did not say that young people who read "Zhuangzi and the Literary Anthology" will eat endlessly for the rest of their lives and benefit infinitely, and do not need to seek new knowledge.</p>
<p>Right: Reply to Mr. Gao Zhi (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Letters from Readers</h3>
<p>To the editor of Free Talk:</p>
<p>Because I am in Beiping, it is very difficult for me to see your magazine. I am not very familiar with the situation of Shanghai writers and scholars. I have heard friends talk about it, and they always talk about it, saying that there is an article in your magazine that refers to my criticism of Zheng Zhenduo's Literary History published in the sixth issue of the fourth volume of New Moon. I regret very much that I have not been able to read this article. It is said that the content of this article says that my criticisms are not very wrong, but the attitude is very bad. Shichang is not sensitive and does not know himself. I do not know which points in my article are referred to as bad. If the author of the article can specifically point out and explain why it is worse than other book reviews, or how I should say it to be better, Shichang will be grateful. This is one thing. It is also said that a certain newspaper article said that I have surrendered to Mr. Zheng, which made people laugh at first, and then lose their smiles. Those who are shocked are shocked by the sharpness of a person's pen, who can also fabricate things out of nothing from an irresistible reason. Those who laugh laugh at their hard work and incompetence, and have nothing to do after eating. I think it is far better to take a walk on the Bund or help a coolie push a wheelbarrow, which is also a good thing. But I think this is not without reason, and I should explain it. After my manuscript was published, Mr. Zheng immediately sent a letter to the editor of New Moon, defending five points, only the last half point of which was reasonable (and this last point is the least important one-fifth of my article, as can be seen by reviewing the original text). And this last point of defense is said to have been written by a certain professor. I have rebuttals to all five points, which are more than 5,000 words long and sent to the editor of New Moon. Unfortunately, the eighth issue of the fourth volume of New Moon has not been published until now. Everyone who has a manuscript in this issue is dying of anxiety, and it is not only Shichang who is suffering. The first, third, and fourth volumes of Mr. Zheng's Literary History have been published, and I also have a long review, which I originally planned to send to New Moon, so I put it on hold. I am a very simple person. Although I grew up in Jiangnan, I have never (and do not like to) seen that kind of world in Shanghai. If I have an opinion on a certain book, I criticize it, but based on the common reason of mankind, he should believe me if he is right, and he should believe me if I am right. There is only right and wrong between us, there is no so-called "face," "attack," "surrender," or "compromise," which are only vulgar nouns that exist in vulgar brains. In Beiping, I also heard many rumors that I thought were very clever, such as a certain faction using someone to attack a certain faction, etc. Alas, if you have never been used by others or used others, how can you know that there is a noun called "use" in heaven and earth? But I ignored those rumors, so the makers of the rumors also blushed and cooled down. In fact, Mr. Zheng is a professor at Yenching, and I am a student. We meet every day, and sometimes eat together. If he has a book in the future, I can still criticize each other if I have an opinion. If we find the truth, we can admit it to each other. I have been reading books for more than ten years, and I have not read these kinds of nouns of "surrender" and "compromise." Which gentleman gave them to me? I return them to you with a long bow here. If the editor is kind enough to publish this letter, my gratitude will be inexpressible. Best wishes. Wu Shichang</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (12)</h3>
<p>— Authored by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Notary Public Lecaru continued,</p>
<p>"My colleague in Paris has already notified me of the main provisions of his will. In that will, he specifies your son, Jean Roland, as the heir to all his property."</p>
<p>Everyone was so surprised by these words that they couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>Madame Roland was the first to restrain her emotions, saying haltingly,</p>
<p>"Oh my, poor René... our poor friend... Oh my... Oh my... He's dead!..."</p>
<p>Tears appeared in her eyes, the quiet tears of a woman, so painful and yet so clear as they flowed down her cheeks, drops of sorrow emanating from the soul.</p>
<p>But Old Man Roland was completely focused on the joyful news of the inheritance, not caring about the death of his old friend. However, he dared not immediately inquire about the terms of the will and the amount of the property. To get to these relevant questions, he circled around and asked,</p>
<p>"What disease did poor Maréchal die of?"</p>
<p>Mr. Lecaru did not know this at all. He said,</p>
<p>"I only know that the deceased had no direct heirs. He left all his property! An annual interest of about 20,000 francs attached to a 3% debt! All of it is left to your second son, saying that he watched him being born, growing up, and considered him suitable to receive this bequest. If Mr. Jean does not wish to accept it, the inheritance will be donated to the foundlings in the orphanage." Old Man Roland could no longer hide his joy, he exclaimed,</p>
<p>"Great! This is truly a kind thought. If I had no descendants, I would never forget to bequeath my property to this honest friend!"</p>
<p>The notary smiled and said,</p>
<p>"I was very happy to report this matter to you in person. Bringing good news to people is always a joy."</p>
<p>He had no idea that this good news was the death of a friend, the death of one of Old Man Roland's best friends, and Roland himself quickly forgot the close friendship he had just described so precisely.</p>
<p>Only Madame Roland and her two children maintained a sorrowful expression. She was still weeping softly, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, and then placing the handkerchief over her mouth to suppress the heavy sighs.</p>
<p>The doctor said softly,</p>
<p>"He was an honest and very kind man. He often invited us to dinner, me and my brother."</p>
<p>Jean's eyes were wide open and sparkling with excitement. With a practiced gesture, he held his beautiful golden beard in his right hand, stroking it all the way to the tips of the longest strands, as if to lengthen and thin them out. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial Exchange Retraction, Gold Price Rises Slightly by Two Dollars and Twenty Cents 丨Half a Day Struggling Around Ninety Dollars丨</h3>

The saying of Finance Minister Song's resignation, whether it was true or not, the market sentiment was still vague, but it was more stable than before. The selling households in the market were still the largest at No. 50, and they were mostly from the banking industry. However, the eating households were not as timid as before, although they were mostly scattered, there were also many large households, and the amount was quite considerable. The shorts suppressed several times, and the market price was tired but recovered, and the trend had turned around. At the opening in the morning, No. 47 was greatly bought, and the layoff sharply rose by more than one yuan. Other varieties, except for the 20th customs which was a small 0.1 angle, the gold short was still rising sharply due to No. 4's selling, so it was uniquely a small 0.4 angle, and the rest were good by several angles. In the second session, the layoff saw a slight return, and the rest continued to rise due to the active eating households. The 20th customs uniquely rose by 0.6 angle, but the salt tax was sold wildly by No. 50, and it was suppressed by a small 0.4 angle again. Therefore, the various varieties behind also slightly decreased with the trend. At the opening in the afternoon, No. 50 had stopped selling, and more gangs made up for their shorts, and only large households bought in, and the market price continued to rise. The salt tax also turned up by 0.7 angle. The late night report at the closing, Song's resignation, the central government was still trying to retain, except for the layoffs being slightly smaller, the rest continued to rise by 3 or 4 angles, and the trend was stable. This kind of reaction was solid in the intention, half because of the relationship on Saturday, and there were two days of holiday, so some shorts made up, and the rebound was very strong. The market price result, calculated to rise by 0.2 to 1.6 angles, of which the gold short, due to No. 4 selling extremely much, only rose by 0.2 angle, the layoff disarmament, due to No. 47 buying the most fiercely, so it rose by 1.4 angle and 1.6 angle. The total number of transactions, approximately 24.5 million, the closing was too late, and the calculation was omitted.</p>

It is said that a certain association received as much as 25,600 bales of cotton yarn last month, and two-thirds of the yarn stored in the yarn warehouse was purchased by it. Therefore, some people were agitated and rose, but the environment was still good, and the new shorts were still not very interested, and the price of bid yarn was more than 2 yuan stronger than the current human clock second price.</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton's Rising Power is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market, initially fell due to Southern hedging, then recovered strongly due to Wall Street, and finally fell again due to Southern hedging. As a result, spot goods rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 6 points. Liverpool cotton spot goods did not move, and futures all rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 4 points, and the Bombay cotton market rose due to a small number of scattered European exporters buying. As a result, Aumra rose by half a rupee, and Pingar and Bairoxi both rose by 0.25 angles. The original telegram is recorded on the left (27th telegram),</p>

<h3>US President's Reiteration of Prices Stirred Cotton Market Reaction</h3>
<p>New York, 27th Report on Cotton Market in One Week, President Roosevelt's renewed attention to raising prices and establishing the gold market declaration, stirred up the cotton market reaction, but all the needs were for hedging and long closing. Therefore, the weekend market situation slightly declined. Those in the industry have conflicting views on the impact of raising gold prices on the price level. The deposit of one angle per pound has been implemented in the South, and it is said that its foundation is quite stable, although some farmers who signed the contract are quite skeptical. It is reported that the cotton contract, which destroyed cotton fields this year, and the rent paid by the government, will be distributed in the middle of next week. The exchange of Indian raw cotton and Japanese goods has attracted much attention. At the same time, the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia will increase a source of exports for American cotton, which is also very noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Grain Slightly Improved Far-Month Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of stabilizing first and then weakening. As the Chicago quotation for foreign wheat rebounded by about one dollar and one dime, and Canada rose by one or two dimes, people's confidence was still stable at the beginning. Later, due to the successive return of actual sales brokers, the spot price in Tianjin showed a flat and weak trend. The exchange's previous restrictions on sellers were announced to the market the day before yesterday, restoring the original state. In this way, manufacturers gained the convenience of selling again. For this reason, although the price of foreign wheat rebounded, the market atmosphere turned quiet again, about one cent less than the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the market was very soft for this month due to a large number of returned draft orders. The forward contracts recovered as many firms frequently bought them in, but there were few transactions, just a small rebound. As a result, October and November each rose by a small five mills, December by a large seven and a half mills, January by a large one and a half cents, and February and March by a large one cent.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market generally showed a stable trend. As the quotation for foreign wheat rebounded, people's confidence did not fluctuate much after the opening. However, as the spot chips on the market gradually decreased, foreign wheat seemed unable to arrive immediately. Moreover, considering the situation this month (with about thirty vehicles for actual delivery), although the market has ended, the final rebound was absorbed by manufacturers. The industry and outsiders generally viewed it as such, and the market atmosphere gradually stabilized. As a result, November and December each improved by one cent, January by two cents, February by three cents, and March by two cents. The current wheat still appears stable, with the opening price for Bengbu wheat at three yuan and nine dimes and a half, Jiangyan wheat at three yuan and eight dimes and six or seven cents, Gaoyou wheat at three yuan and eight dimes and five cents, and Wuhu wheat at three yuan and five dimes and seven cents, with Fuxin taking away five thousand packages and Fufeng taking away one thousand packages, it is said.</p>
<p>A total of forty-five vehicles of spot wheat were delivered this month, with No. 1 taking away thirty vehicles, and the rest being sporadic hoarding and arbitrage income.</p>
<h3>Kiln Seed Baige Continues to Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) There are more than thirty sources, with about four thousand stones of goods. The flat and weak market conditions seem to have turned around. At the beginning of the market, the appetite of the Benjie stores was quite depressed, and the brokers' interest in accepting goods was also strong, but the arrival of goods was relatively scarce, so the situation was quite good. However, after a long period of weakness, people's confidence is still difficult to stabilize, so the market softened again in the afternoon. As a result, the overall situation is still tight. According to statistics, the stomach for kiln-grown Baige six-middle packs continued to handle one thousand two to three hundred packs, and the market was slightly higher. All kinds of new japonica rice also had two to three thousand stones, and the price followed closely. Duyangjian rose a few cents, with sales of about two thousand stones. Broken japonica rice was only five or six hundred stones, and it was stable. The change in yuan had no significant difference, but the Bianyuan liquor households have already moved, with an opening price of eight yuan and three dimes.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The arrival of goods from various routes in Hexia was twenty-six to seven, and the market sales were still sluggish. The market form showed a slightly tight trend for new japonica rice, Yangdujian. The price of kiln-grown goods was nearly one dime higher due to the scarcity of goods, the price of Baige was slightly higher, and the price of Baiyuan Yinyuan was slightly higher. The broken japonica rice and guest pointed rice were still stable.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Brokers Continue to Handle and Load Ke Xian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market was in a stagnant situation due to the Fujian brokers' handling and the cargo owners' firm rejection. Later, a part of the Fuzhou brokers came to the market to handle and load, and the market was slightly active, but the market was still flat. The Quanzhou brokers had foreign rice arriving at the port and had no intention of handling Ke Xian again, so there was no inquiry yesterday. The Benjie and Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces did not inquire. According to statistics, one hundred bags of Hunan Ji Jing were opened, priced at seven yuan and one dime and a half, and seven hundred bags of Jing Jing were priced at six yuan and four dimes to six yuan and three dimes and a half, and the next was five yuan and nine dimes and a half. 164 bags of Nanjing brown rice were priced at five yuan and three dimes, all handled by Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Sesame Sales Still Active</h3>
<p>The sesame trend is quite firm, with the price of customs goods being better than that of higher-quality goods, because the Shaoxing oil pressing market needs to purchase goods with suitable prices. Yesterday, 340+ bags were sold, all of which were medium-grade goods. The price of Jiujiang black sesame rose and then fell, because the source was slightly accumulated, and the sales of this variety were not large. Yesterday, 30 bags were purchased by the former gang, priced at eight yuan and three dimes. Shantou gang traded 60 bags, priced at eight yuan and two dimes and a half.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tubers Shortage and Sharp Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, Sichuan pickled mustard tubers have been in short supply due to the lack of continued sources. The cargo owners' opening price suddenly rose sharply, with the high-quality goods opening up to thirty yuan, an increase of six yuan from the previous price. The price also rose accordingly, with high-quality goods selling for thirty yuan, and the next at twenty-six to seven yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea The Drastic Change in US Exchange Rate Affects Silk Prices</h3>
<p>(New York Silk Prices Plummeted by More Than One Dime) After the United States announced its policy of raising prices, the US exchange rate gradually contracted. The New York raw silk market price gradually rose by one dime, five or six cents per pound (US dollars). However, the exchange market suddenly underwent a drastic reaction the day before yesterday. The exchange rate plummeted, and the silk price also plummeted accordingly, falling by more than one dime per pound (US dollars), returning to the original price before the increase. The sudden rise and fall of silk prices in New York this time was purely due to the exchange rate relationship, and silk sales remained sluggish. (Sixty More Pieces of Sichuan Yellow Silk Arrived) Yesterday, the Jiangshun轮船 imported sixty pieces of Sichuan yellow silk, which were loaded from Hankou and taken back to the warehouse by Baotaihe and others for storage.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Continue to Be Flat) Yesterday, the local artificial silk market continued to be flat. Only the Changjiang gang imported 28 boxes of Shuangxing, Honglv, and Jinzhong brands for November futures, priced from 172 yuan and five dimes to 170 yuan and seven dimes and a half net.</p>
<p>(Silk Sales in Shanghai Stalled Again) Overseas silk prices have been gradually rising for several days due to exchange rates. However, the US exchange rate soared the day before yesterday, and New York silk prices plummeted by more than thirty yuan in one day (Chinese currency per package). However, Lyon in the UK was still able to stand firm. Shanghai's major US firms, hearing of this exchange change, did not dare to take risks, and the market was stagnant. There was only a half-day market yesterday morning, and there were no transactions in current silk. The future of silk sales is still difficult to grasp for a while.</p>
<h3>Road Dealers' Zhenmei Slightly Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign tea market saw a slight sale of Zhenmei green tea from the Road Dealers. Baochang, Fushi, and other firms purchased more than 240 boxes. The selling price of Gaoghuang goods from Wuyuan North Road ranged from 116 yuan to 129 yuan. The selling price of Tunxi goods ranged from 90 yuan to 105 yuan. There were no large transactions for other items such as Zhenmei and Xiumei. As for black tea, the market trend declined due to the recent sluggish sales in the UK, and no one asked about it, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oil Market New Tallow From West Zhejiang Is Approaching</h3>
<p>New tallow goods are about to appear, and those engaged in this industry are paying attention to the buying and selling of new oil. Shanghai is adjacent to Zhejiang Province, and especially close to the production area of Jiaxing in West Zhejiang. Therefore, the earliest arrival of new oil in Shanghai every year should be the Ben Che oil from Jiaxing. Because pressing is already underway around the Light Snow period in that area, once new oil is seen, it can arrive in the local area overnight. If measured by past years, then the sales of futures have already been traded at this time. However, the candle-making industry and Taobao merchants are used to prepare for the New Year's goods. According to the lunar calendar, it is still in the early ninth month, and the preparation for the New Year's goods is still far away. Therefore, the candle merchants' attitude is quite calm. However, according to the season, the tallow seeds have already matured, and the pressing workshops in the production area are busy collecting seeds and pressing oil. It is said that the harvest in West Zhejiang is still good, and the old oil has just been sold out, continuing the new goods without interruption. According to the situation in Zhejiang Road, new oil seems difficult to be too cheap. Moreover, the Shaoxing pressing workshops have already been buying tallow seeds in the Jiaxing area for sales, and the price is generally between five yuan and five or six dimes per stone. Calculated on this basis, the cost of tallow oil may be more than twenty yuan. Currently, local industry insiders estimate that it is only within twenty yuan, because there are still many old goods of Hanjing Jingma oil, etc., which has led to a gradual market weakness. The Shanghai market has always followed the lead of the Hankou market. For this reason, it has not been able to approach Zhejiang Road, and the tallow seed pressing workshops in West Zhejiang have not yet collected the seeds and dare not rashly sell oil at a low price, resulting in a quiet new market in the market these days. In short, the start of pressing this year is earlier, and each family must prepare more of the raw material tallow seeds, so the price of seeds may not be easy to expect to be cheap. And the oil output will increase compared with previous years, so the oil price is not easy to be good. In the future, raw goods and cooked goods may go in opposite directions, which is also unknown. If that is the case, then the operation of each pressing workshop will be very difficult to cope with. The local industry's base accumulation is already thin, but sales are extremely scattered, and it is generally waiting for the development of new goods. The cargo price of Chong Jing is still around twenty-two yuan per burden, Ping Jing is twenty-one yuan and three or four dimes, and Macheng is nineteen yuan and five or six dimes. Although the Hankou market is stable on the surface, the content is extremely miserable, and the market is quite depressed.</p>
<h3>Hardware Egg Factory Brokers Actively Handle Tinplate</h3>
<p>Due to the poor sales of the foreign egg white industry, Prime brand American tinplate, which is exclusively distributed by egg factory brokers in Shanghai, is also sluggish. Therefore, the industry colleagues who specialize in egg factory brokers are quite distressed. In the past three or four days, it has been heard that the egg factory brokers have shown a trend of activity, which has led to a prosperous trend in the local tinplate market, which has been in a slump. The price per box is 38 yuan and five dimes. It is said that more than six or seven hundred boxes were opened yesterday.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Special Issue School Life</p>
<h3>Newcomer Key</h3>
<p>— Ji Jue</p>
<p>I remember that one year, I visited an opening ceremony at a certain church university. One of the programs was the presentation of the "Newcomer Key" to the representative of the freshman class by the class leader of the sophomore class. The program was very solemn and tense. The so-called "key" was actually a long key, and the word "newcomer" was directly translated from the English "Freshman". The key was engraved with the four characters "Gate of Entering Virtue", meaning that it was the key to entering virtue for university freshmen. They could keep it for one year, and after one year, they would pass it on to the next class of freshmen, circulating between the old and the new. This program has therefore been followed to this day.</p>
<p>For a group of students who have just come out of the orderly and constrained middle school and stepped into the complex threshold of the university, without understanding the mystery of university life and without fully understanding the search for the treasure trove of knowledge, this golden key to enlighten and stimulate is given to prevent them from blindly rushing around without a clue, hoping that they will move towards the "Gate of Entering Virtue". After one year, whether they have entered the "Gate of Entering Virtue" is still a question, but this mysterious key must be passed on to the next class of students. The next class of students will even more obediently "draw a gourd according to the pattern".</p>
<p>Things in society often evolve in this way. The advanced generations can earnestly exhort the younger generations to work hard and instruct them on the methods of dealing with people and things. The younger generations do not follow his exhortations, completely abandoning all the wise sayings left by the advanced generations, doing whatever they want, making human desires rampant, and the society becomes more and more chaotic. As a result, the predecessors' last words are passed on to future generations in their original form, still calling on them to learn well, but the fact may not be so! Mr. Sun Yat-sen devoted himself to the revolution for forty years, knowing that "the revolution has not yet succeeded", and earnestly instructed future generations with "comrades still need to work hard". Those who died after Mr. Sun Yat-sen must apologetically say "the revolution has not succeeded but the body has died first...work hard! Comrades..."</p>
<p>But I hope that this is not comparable to the story of the "Newcomer Key".</p>
<h3>Monday Morning</h3>
<p>— Shu Ying</p>
<p>The clock on the wall of the No. room is pointing to eight o'clock. The gatekeeper, Afu, is printing lecture notes on the mimeograph machine. At this time, he looks up at the clock and wants to walk out the door, but suddenly seems to realize something, stops, and turns back to continue his work.</p>
<p>Class begins and ends, and the bell rings on time. This is the gatekeeper's responsibility. If he is late, he will be scolded, especially for the bell that ends class. However, every Monday, the first class is usually a memorial week, which will only be held after the principal arrives, so ringing the bell cannot be as monotonous as on weekdays.</p>
<p>The playground, a small square surrounded by high walls, is already bathed in sunlight, and the air is relatively warmer. Except for those in the dormitory, all the students are gathered here. Some are playing ball, some are doing woolen work, and some are holding books to read, but most are talking:</p>
<p>"How did you have fun yesterday?" Ms. C asked several classmates standing with her.</p>
<p>"The three of us watched a movie at the Nanjing Grand Theater. How about you?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday there were many guests at my house, so I just muddled through the day at home. In the evening, B asked me to go dancing. I think dancing is more interesting."</p>
<p>"Of course! But we who live in the school don't have this blessing, and we don't have such a limelight as you, and no one accompanies us."</p>
<p>"Don't make fun of me, but it's okay to go even if you live in the school. Yesterday I saw the principal and Mr. T there, and it was already past eleven o'clock when they went. I was afraid that we would all be restrained, so I left first. I really wasn't satisfied!"</p>
<p>Little sister D looked at her watch at this time:</p>
<p>"Oh my god! It's going to die, it's already half past nine, how long will we have to wait! I'm afraid he danced until dawn last night and is still sleeping now."</p>
<p>"Who cares, isn't it good to bask in the sun here a little longer?"</p>
<p>"That's right, I don't think there's any point in going to class. These teachers are really incompetent," Ms. A said somewhat conceitedly.</p>
<p>"Dang! Dang! Dang!" Afu rang the bell so loudly that it shook the sky, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Everyone gradually walked to the auditorium, which was filled in an instant. First, everyone stood up, saluted, and sang. When the chairman respectfully read the will of the Premier, the principal appeared on the stage, faced the portrait, and read the will aloud. After reading it, he bowed his head in silence. From the back, he looked very pious.</p>
<p>"Report!" As soon as this voice came out, Principal quickly turned around and gave everyone a slight nod with a kind smile, and began to report, the gist of which was: "The national crisis is so serious, and the Japanese are bullying us so much, I hope that the students will all take on the responsibility of saving the country." Then the director of discipline, the director of education, and the director of affairs successively reported on school affairs, gave lectures, etc. Everyone became impatient to listen, the sound of talking rose, and the woolen work was openly taken out and done.</p>
<p>Time passed minute by minute, and the stage was finally empty, and then the meeting was dismissed.</p>
<p>Afu is really too obsequious. As soon as people walked into the classroom, he rang the class bell again.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Huang walked into the classroom door, everyone shouted:</p>
<p>"Hey! The third class is about to end, why are we still having the second class?"</p>
<p>"We don't want your teachers to teach!"</p>
<p>"It's better to have it tomorrow, there will be one tomorrow, it's already over today."</p>
<p>Mr. Huang seemed unwilling to leave, and while they were at an impasse, the old Mr. Yu of Chinese came.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" The old gentleman greeted Mr. Huang and said.</p>
<p>"Don't be polite!" Mr. Huang took his book and walked out.</p>
<p>Then there was a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>The Chinese teacher is the best at talking, so the laughter continued for a long time, and no one heard the roll call.</p>
<h3>Sketches of University Dormitories</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun Ren</p>
<p>There are three people in the same room: Lao Zhang, Lao Wang, and Lao Li.</p>
<p>Today, Lao Zhang's leather shoes could be heard from far away as he came to the room, especially hurried and powerful. As soon as he arrived in the room, he slammed the lecture notes, which were only assigned a few chapters to look at during the big exam, onto the table with a whoosh. The head of the lecture notes was already crisscrossed with the names and criticisms of female students, which was the result of discussing with Lao Zhao next door during class.</p>
<p>At this time, Lao Wang's love letter had just been written. There was no more work to do, so he wanted to ask Lao Zhang for news.</p>
<p>"Lao Zhang, did you Make eyes with Xiao Zhou in class today?"</p>
<p>"Why not, I'm telling you, she seems to have a little interest too. She didn't turn her head to look at me a few days ago."</p>
<p>After Lao Zhang said this, he was happy and a little embarrassed. He wanted to cover up this embarrassment, so he became happy with Lao Wang. He laughed and suddenly hugged Lao Wang, shouting madly:</p>
<p>"Sister, I love you!"</p>
<p>Who knew that the voice was too loud and woke up Lao Li, who was taking a nap. No one could guess what Lao Li was dreaming about during the day. Although his dream was awakened, Lao Li was not angry, because the topic of discussion was neither as boring as national affairs nor as rigid as academics. After listening to Lao Zhang's report on the love affair in class today, he was very excited and felt happy for others' happiness.</p>
<p>"That's right, Lao Zhang," Lao Li said loudly to Lao Zhang, and then suggested to Lao Zhang:</p>
<p>"First, you go to borrow notes from her in a few days. This is both generous and not abrupt."</p>
<p>"And then?" Lao Zhang was anxious to death.</p>
<p>"Second," Lao Li said again, "aren't we going to have a department meeting soon? Let's have you two work together as committee members."</p>
<p>"That's right, it's good to have a committee (tail) to interact with." Lao Wang laughed, Lao Li also laughed, and Lao Zhang laughed even more. The laughter of the three people turned a room into a pond full of frogs.</p>
<p>Hahahaha!</p>
<h3>Dangers of Off-Campus Dormitories</h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>The value of land and rent in Shanghai is really too expensive, so many schools cannot build more dormitories to accommodate students' boarding. Some students have to rent dormitories near the school on their own. However, apartment-style buildings in Shanghai that are exclusively for students are currently in the minority, so they have to live with ordinary people, and various dangerous things happen from then on.</p>
<p>I often hear friends say: "What is the reason for this? Many young people go to Shanghai to study, and as a result, they end up 'unable to return to their hometown' and 'unable to see their parents'..." At first, I couldn't figure out why. Now I think what I'm about to say may be one reason, one fact.</p>
<p>In the dormitories outside of XX school, there are some students whose actions now I dare not assert that they will definitely fall in the future, but these actions are indeed enough to lead young people to the road of depravity, which is very assertive.</p>
<p>Playing mahjong, playing cards... These are all the worst pastimes in society, which is admitted by many. But now these students not only cannot persuade people to improve, but instead do it themselves with relish. Every night, you can always hear the sound of playing cards and dice in their rooms. It's even worse on Sundays. Everything, they are really too interested in these gambling activities.</p>
<p>The purpose of gambling is nothing more than to use money to win or lose, but students' money is limited. If the money runs out, I am afraid that at that time, all kinds of dangerous actions will unconsciously arise!</p>
<p>During this national crisis, what are the responsibilities of students? What should be done? What should not be done. I think very smart students will definitely be able to wake up; but now these students are too blinded by bad habits, and without great courage, I am afraid they will not be able to run out of the dangerous den of all evil!</p>
<p>Alas! Sin! Dormitory outside XX school.</p>
<h3>Two Geography Teachers</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Recently, I heard two geography teachers' absolutely different views on Chinese geography teaching, and they were arguing so ridiculously and painfully.</p>
<p>A said: When I teach students Chinese geography, after the signing of the Tanggu Truce, I will never talk about the four northeastern provinces, because these four provinces are no longer ours. Although the government is shouting about long-term resistance, it is actually a long-term betrayal; the anti-Japanese heroes say that they will continue to fight, but in fact they are in long-term recuperation; suppressing the outside and pacifying the inside has become harmonizing with the outside and pacifying the inside. There is no hope of recovering these fallen four provinces, so every time I mention them, I feel infinitely sad, like losing a treasure, and there is no hope of returning the pearl. The more I think about it, the more sad I am, but it is useless to be sad and useless to be sad. What we should pay attention to now are the mountains and rivers of the unlost land, and the population, products, transportation, politics, industry and commerce, education, etc., should all be made clear to the students, so that they know their relationship with life, and arouse their love for this beautiful country, so that they cannot bear to lose another inch of land. It is also like taking out the unlost treasures and instructing the children and grandchildren one by one, telling them their functions and values, calling on them to preserve them forever and pass them on forever, so that they will never be lost again. Isn't this better than just hurting the lost land and actually having no power to recover it? Therefore, my not talking about the four northeastern provinces is precisely to protect the unlost land.</p>
<p>B said: In the past, when talking about the four northeastern provinces, it could be brief and sloppy, but now it must be taught more thoroughly. The area and population of the four provinces, railways and rivers, sorghum and soybeans, forests and minerals, animal skins and wool, high mountains and plains, wasteland and cultivated land, and the relationship between these four provinces and the whole country, etc., must all be made more familiar and more recognized by the students, so that they can feel the pain of loss and strengthen their determination to recover it. It is like losing a treasure. The more I think about it, the more I feel its loveliness, and the more I try to recover it, and I worry and think hard. Over time, I can naturally return the pearl to Hepu. The government does not want to recover the four northeastern provinces, don't we want to call on the students of the future to recover them? Therefore, my speaking of the four northeastern provinces is more important now than in the past, precisely to prepare for the recovery of the lost land, and also to preserve the whole country.</p>
<p>Is it not ridiculous to not read about the lost territory? Is it not also painful? Speaking vaguely and briefly before losing it, knowing to pay attention to it after it is lost, is it not also the same ridiculous and painful?</p>

<h3>Look! The Current State of Our Countryside</h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>Not long ago, I, the reporter, received a letter from a friend in the rural area of Xieshi, Zhejiang. It described the bankruptcy of the Chinese rural economy with the following passage:</p>
<p>"I have personally witnessed the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the general plight of the peasants here. Taxes remain high without reduction, and the prices of agricultural products are generally low. The vast majority of farmers are consciously expressing many subconscious complaints about the current situation. These voices can be easily heard on small boats on the inland rivers, in teahouses, and at gatherings under the mulberry trees in the fields. Without even asking, one can hear the same discussions, curses, and protests. However, they are very scattered and unorganized!"</p>
<p>Following this, at the end of his letter, there is a quote from an old farmer that is even more thought-provoking and enlightening for us to understand the crisis and direction of improvement for this Chinese nation that relies on agriculture:</p>
<p>"Yesterday, an old farmer answered me with the following words, which I feel carry a very serious meaning. He said: 'We have the fields, and we haven't sold a single piece of them. We have never been lazy in our lives (referring to work). But this year, it's as if the fields are gone, our hard work is in vain, and we are inexplicably poor!' Finally, he added vaguely and self-pityingly: 'But we will never believe that we made ourselves poor!'" This is the situation for a self-cultivating farmer; the bankruptcy situation is already like this. Then, the miserable situation of other general hired farmhands can be imagined. Here, the land price was worth 100 yuan per mu two years ago, but now no one is interested even at 40 yuan."</p>
<p>Such complaints are still limited to the relatively wealthy rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As for the general bankruptcy of the rural economies in provinces such as Anhui, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan, the situation is even more significant. According to a recent report received by the Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society from the Commissioner for Disaster Relief in northern Anhui, the devastation of the rural areas around Yingfu and Taihe in northern Anhui, with bandits everywhere, is truly astonishing. It is said that in recent years, due to the declining rural economy in various parts of northern Anhui, the old and weak sit and wait for death, while the young and strong often take risks and join the ranks of bandits. This time, as many as twenty-five towns around Yingfu were burned and looted by bandits, and more than 8,000 people were abducted. Over one thousand people were killed at Nanzhao Market and over three thousand at the old county market of Taihe. Only a limited number were redeemed because when those who came to redeem the hostages entered the bandit territory, the bandits were numerous, and they would be checked in each group. If they carried money, it would be searched and taken away, regardless of whether they were there to redeem hostages or not. After the money was taken away, they would cry and complain to that group of bandits, but that group would think it was a lie, or cut off their ears or hands, and still let them go back to raise money, threatening to kill them if they did not meet the deadline. All the children, those who were eight years old were tied in a string, those who were nine or ten years old were tied in a string, and those who were over ten years old were tied in a string, all connected with hemp ropes, and whipped from behind, making them wail and jump. The bandits enjoyed this. Such a tragic scene, not to mention witnessing it personally, is unbearable to imagine just hearing about it! And what we should especially know is that the so-called Yingfu and Taihe areas were the most prosperous agricultural areas in northern Anhui ten years ago. Yingfu (Fuyang) is the old Yingzhou Prefecture city. Taihe is about one hundred li from Fuyang, both being large towns along the Ying River, a tributary of the Huai River, about five hundred li from Bengbu. Ten years ago, British and American merchants purchased more than one million yuan worth of agricultural products, such as eggs, pigs, and cattle, every year in this area, transported them from the Ying River to Bengbu, loaded them onto the Jinpu Railway, transferred them to Yangtze River steamers, and exported them to Shanghai. The prosperity of that place at that time can be imagined. Who would have thought that ten years later, it would be reduced to this state?</p>
<p>Let's look at Sichuan again! According to people who recently came from Sichuan, "The current state of rural abandonment in that province is far beyond imagination. The main reason is that the warlords in Sichuan have been engaged in endless infighting for several years, coupled with droughts. The land tax in northern Sichuan has been collected up to the year 260 of the Republic of China, that is, pre-collected for 240 years in advance. Although the southern, eastern, and western parts of Sichuan have not reached this level, they have at least been collected up to the years 60 or 70 of the Republic of China, that is, 40 or 50 years in advance! Therefore, the people all regard engaging in honest work as foolish. Everyone indulges in gambling, and all the parks and entertainment venues have been replaced by gambling dens!"</p>
<p>We hear about the trend of the entire rural collapse in various inland provinces, and we see the situation of all the abnormally developing things on the surface in Shanghai. Unless we don't use our brains to think, we believe that we don't have to wait for imperialism to take action themselves. This huge Republic of China is about to hand itself over to others for joint management and division! Don't believe it? Look! Everything that has been expressed in various aspects recently, isn't every single one of them heading down this road?</p>
<p>The progress of a society, and even the revival of an entire nation, depends on the struggle of various forces in all aspects, constantly moving forward, in order to achieve results. Looking at the current situation, apart from a few people who are self-righteous and blindly and chaotically acting, making bombastic statements to deceive people, what shows this kind of struggling power? This entire society has entered a state of complete lifelessness! This is the feeling that reality gives us; it's not a question of pessimism or optimism.</p>

<h3>Eye Exercises Before Watching the Tide</h3>
<p>— Sha Shelang</p>
<p>Factory Worker... Small Clerk</p>
<p>"Ahem!" I knew it was him again when I heard that sound. I quickly took those few pages of invoices from the drawer and placed them on the table, ready to judge by his expression. At the same time, my heart was beating.</p>
<p>"Have you finished calculating?" he asked, with an impatient expression and a strong tone.</p>
<p>I stood up and handed him those few pages of invoices, but the reply that came to my throat, I swallowed it down again.</p>
<p>"Six, seven, eight! Hey, I want to see the invoices for September."</p>
<p>"Sir, the invoices for September haven't been finalized yet."</p>
<p>"What! Haven't been finalized yet? You handle things really... really..."</p>
<p>His eyeballs, separated by three hundred degrees of "Zeiss" glass, popped up, almost rolling out. A thin smile floated on his nose, what an embarrassing expression. But I pretended to be upright, standing and waiting for his next words...</p>
<p>"Why don't you finalize them quickly? Don't you know that the manager is urging for the general ledger? The manager... you have to understand. Don't hold me back."</p>
<p>"Yes! Sir, the September inventory ledger was originally finalized, but the machine parts list from the coppersmith foreman hasn't been checked and sent over..."</p>
<p>"No, annoying. I don't care about your coppersmith foreman or anyone else. I only ask you for the September invoices."</p>
<p>"Yes... yes... sir, but if there is no machine parts list, there is nowhere to check the prices of many things."</p>
<p>"According to what you say, then you will never finalize it? Why don't you urge him?"</p>
<p>"Yes... yes, but, I have already urged him. The coppersmith foreman said that the general ledger will be submitted to the manager at the end of the month..."</p>
<p>At this time, it felt like a hundred fawns were running in my heart, and ten million needles were pricking my back. The air in front of me was suffocating. He said seriously again, "What do you know? Too troublesome, you go sit in my seat. You young people are most hateful for not obeying the orders of your superiors. To be honest with you, obeying your superiors is never wrong."</p>
<p>He threw it lightly on my desk with his hand, half to express his anger, and the other half seemed to express that his words were absolute.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes..." I dare not say anything more. Secretly peeking at his eyes that had not calmed down.</p>
<p>"No, you can't stay here. I'll wait for your September invoices."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the coppersmith foreman sent the machine parts list.</p>

<h3>On Germany's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhao Xianjing</p>
<p>Many people have expressed boundless sympathy and admiration for Hitler's withdrawal from the League of Nations this time, believing that this is the most concrete manifestation of oppressed nations resisting the united oppression of international imperialism. If the issue is really that simple, then wasn't Japan's withdrawal from the League not long ago also a manifestation of resisting imperialism? The withdrawal of any country from the League of Nations is of course due to dissatisfaction with the League of Nations and the League of Nations' inability to grant certain rights, and it is definitely not without purpose. Therefore, to conclude that a country's break from the constraints of the League of Nations is resistance to imperialism would be laughably foolish in thought!</p>
<p>If China were the one withdrawing from the League of Nations this time, that would be a joyful action of resisting imperialism because China is in a colonial position. However, Germany is different from and even the opposite of China. Before the war, Germany was the overlord of imperialism. After the war, although it was in the position of a defeated country and suffered the oppression of the victorious countries, struggling under the Treaty of Versailles, there is no doubt that it is still an imperialist country from its domestic and foreign political and economic relations. And Hitler's rise to power is further proof that Germany is moving toward the peak of imperialism. Therefore, Hitler's withdrawal from the international organization this time because he could not achieve his demand for equal armaments is precisely an expression of the irreconcilable contradictions between imperialists. Where is the anti-imperialist action of the German nation?</p>
<p>Indeed, the external appearance of the German National Socialist Party, in short, is extreme nationalism, state supremacy. Its political goal is to thoroughly develop the spirit of militarism externally, oppose the Treaty of Versailles; and internally, it loathes Marxism and negates class struggle. Therefore, before it gained power, its slogan was to build Greater Germany, abolish the Treaty of Versailles, and oppose socialist parties. Taking advantage of the increasingly deepening economic panic, political instability, and the leftist thinking of the working class and peasants, Hitler seized power by the fastest means and sat on the throne of German rule. However, he is very clear that under the current situation, it is impossible to refuse the support of various imperialists and rule Germany and suppress the "reactionaries" alone. Especially the contradictions and weakness of the National Socialist Party itself made him express softening to international imperialism on the first day after he gained power, saying: "The new cabinet maintains peaceful and friendly relations with the world." And the "abolition of the Treaty of Versailles," which was originally one of the main political programs of the National Socialist Party, was silently changed to "amend the Treaty of Versailles." As for his four-year plan to revive Germany, it is still an unfulfilled check to this day. All of this is enough to make the German people's belief in Hitler waver day by day. Therefore, in order to extend the life of his rule, Hitler took the opportunity of the resumption of the Disarmament Conference to put forward the demand for equal armaments. When his request was not fulfilled, he followed it up with withdrawal from the League of Nations, wanting to divert the line of sight of domestic opposition with foreign issues. However, Hitler only issued a notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations. The actual restraints have not yet been lifted, but he triumphantly erected a so-called "Liberation Monument" in Kelheim and publicly gave a speech: Germany's only purpose is to seek happiness and love peace, so now they have nothing to ask for but to work with peace of mind! It can be seen that Hitler's withdrawal from the League of Nations this time is not to revive Germany from the extreme nationalist standing, he is just representing the higher-class Germans or German imperialists to express surrender or non-resistance to other imperialists.</p>
<p>In a panic　emotion, even dialing the abacus beads became strangely inflexible. Awkwardly, I calculated five times and got five totals. My brain was tired enough from the surveillance of authority. I believed in myself that normally my calculation wouldn't be so bad.</p>
<p>"Gosh, your calculation, hehe, your calculation." These taunts were enough for me to endure. I only hated that there was no hole in the ground to hide in. My feet felt like they had paralysis. I didn't dare to look up at him again.</p>
<p>Originally, there are many such people in this society丨丨 who are unwilling to give others "guidance" and "mutual assistance," but regard "contempt" and "mockery" as their specialty.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the sake of life, I would definitely have run away.</p>
<p>The September invoices were finally settled under his supervision. When he left, he smiled sarcastically, as if mocking me, and said, "Friend, I only know today that your abilities are not bad."</p>
<p>What was left to me was only endless "embarrassment."</p>
<p>After being silent for half an hour, the subordinate clerks in the same position as me whispered again: "He urged so urgently, isn't it just because he wanted to ask for leave to see the tide!"</p>
<p>However, I only then realized the authority of the superior clerk.</p>
<h3>Methods for Small Capital to Operate Small Factories</h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Under the capitalist law of large capital swallowing small capital, it is originally very difficult for small capital to operate small factories, especially in Chinese society, which is externally oppressed by international imperialism and internally attacked by continuous natural and man-made disasters, making the sales market increasingly smaller. Added to the encroachment of large capital, it becomes even more difficult. However, if managed properly, I think it is not necessarily impossible to achieve considerable success. I will now describe my experience and observations below for the reference of those who have small capital and aspire to operate small factories.</p>
<p>(1) Choose to operate those that large capital disdains to operate and that are suitable for the environment and needs. If such industries cannot be found, then choose to operate those with relatively cheap raw materials.</p>
<p>(2) Obtain the secret to the sales market. Reduce prices and improve goods. Lower prices will lead to sales, and better goods will lead to more buyers.</p>
<p>(3) Apply machines that save time and procedures. Although such machines are relatively expensive, they can reduce workers and increase production.</p>
<p>(4) After the factory is opened, the size of the capital required to manufacture goods depends on the speed of sales of the manufactured goods. If you can increase the speed of sales, you can reduce the need for capital and obtain greater profits.</p>
<p>(5) Do not treat workers too harshly, because if they are too harsh, the workers will be dissatisfied; if the workers are dissatisfied, the products will be poor and slow. It must be known that the most important advantage of small factories competing with large factories is the harmonious cooperation between the capital and labor.</p>
<p>(6) Efforts should be made to enable factories or stores in the same industry to exchange opinions and content with each other, and not to strictly keep secrets from each other and destroy each other.</p>
<p>(7) The employment of people should be based purely on talent and ability, and all recommendations based on favors must be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>(8) Industrial research and experiments should be carried out without slack, so that manufactured products can be improved at any time.</p>
<p>(9) Associations should be formed with the same industry for advertising and publicity.</p>
<p>(10) Save on overhead expenses.</p>
<p>The above is naturally just a few major principles; however, if you can follow these principles and add them to your own environmental position, even if you can't achieve great success, you will never fail completely!</p>

<h3>Sunday Education for Working Children in England</h3>
<p>— Li Peiying</p>
<p>In Christian countries, people mostly put on clean clothes on Sundays, remove their usual hard-working faces, and happily go for a walk. This naturally refers to professional people above the middle and upper classes, but laborers have no way to enjoy it because they have to work for a living, regardless of the Sabbath. Because laborers have no time to educate their children, the church comes to serve them. Especially for working children in those so-called civilized countries, they have to go to church every Sabbath to pray. Is this because children and their fathers and brothers like religious beliefs? No! It is entirely because children can get a hearty lunch and some rest at noon when they go to church.</p>
<p>In Germany, the Children Protection Act prohibits children under the age of ten from participating in labor. However, according to a 1930 survey in Saxony, among 52,930 school children, 34,303 were laborers; similarly, in the Sarfeld area, 20% of school children were engaged in certain labor.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, 7,895 primary school students in Berlin are engaged in illegal labor. According to class time, 633 children work 4 hours a day, 119 work 6 hours, and 1,153 cannot even rest completely on Sundays. These children not only do not get better nutrition, but even lack clothes. Especially after Hitler's dictatorship, children are almost completely plunged into a dark hell like their parents.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of children's hell is the same in England. In addition to eating a meal and resting in church every Sabbath, working children in England have to sing hymns, tell stories of the Heavenly Father, and read the Bible told by the clergy. However, because the laborers' children are not interested in these, the church has also set up some singing teams or sports teams to attract them. This</p>

<h3>Ural Machine-Building Plant</h3>
<p>— Guo Xiu Fu</p>
<p>After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union, in order to transform itself from the most backward agricultural country in capitalism into a socialist country surpassing capitalist industrial nations, embarked on the famous Five-Year Economic Plan. To shift all sectors of the national economy to the latest technological foundations—the foundation of the socialist machine industry and the technological base of electrification—the first Five-Year Plan saw the construction of agricultural machinery factories and the world-renowned Dnipro Hydroelectric Station. In the second Five-Year Plan, one of the biggest achievements in heavy industry during the first year was the completion of the Ural Machine-Building Plant in Sverdlovsk. This factory is vast in scale, divided into seven plants: a machine plant, an iron material manufacturing plant, a repair plant, a white iron casting plant, a copper material casting plant, a tool plant, and a model plant, with each plant further divided into many departments. The factory's main products include rolling machines and iron smelting furnaces, among others. These iron smelting furnaces are enormous machines, originally only available in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. However, due to the impact of the capitalist economic panic, the 275 furnaces in the UK, 250 in the US, and 100 in Germany were successively shut down. In contrast, the Soviet Union built 275 iron smelting furnaces during the first Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>Within this factory, there are forty-six types of wall newspapers (mostly dailies) and one thousand two hundred and thirty-four worker correspondents. The submissions are all about striving forward in work. Under the extensive network of correspondents, extending from the machine factory's offices to various plants and departments, public dining halls, and shops, everyone is striving for more production, better quality, improved meals, supply and demand of daily necessities, cleanliness, and hygiene.</p>
<p>Concise and incisive wall newspapers, under the slogan "For Building the Ural Iron Smelting Furnace Plant," greatly assisted this machine-building plant. The newspapers are filled with vivid and lively submissions from its correspondents, reflecting the difficulties, victories, and upward mobility of workers and specialists in their work. They unanimously praised the heroic men and women of the Ural Machine-Building Plant, posting photos of socialist heroes in the newspapers and encouraging other workers to strive to become heroes of socialist construction. In addition, the newspapers regularly publish workers' insights and experiences regarding their work, providing them as a reference for other workers.</p>
<p>Along with the factory's growth and development, many boys and girls from the countryside have undergone the baptism of new socialist culture, economics, and politics, becoming skilled workers, technicians, and organizers.</p>
<p>The living standards of the workers are also improving. Although Sverdlovsk has a good theater, it is inconvenient for the workers of the Ural Machine-Building Plant. Therefore, a cultural center district large enough to accommodate 60,000 people is now being built. It includes cinemas, clubs, a circus, a library, and a cultural and recreation park. Many schools are under construction, and nineteen kindergartens have been established. In addition, worker dormitories with a volume of 12,300 cubic meters have been built, each with a manager specifically responsible for the repair, renting, and cleanliness and hygiene of the rooms within the dormitory.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Similarly, it was not until the establishment of Socialist Sunday Schools (SSS) that church education began to suffer a significant blow, as they were opponents of church education.</p>
<p>Socialist Sunday Schools, or SSS, carry a liberal hue. On the one hand, they oppose the church, and on the other hand, they oppose anti-socialist parties, while at the same time not associating with socialists. Currently, they have 6,420 students and 109 schools throughout the UK, and undoubtedly, it is developing.</p>
<p>What is their attitude towards religion? The secretary-general of the SSS once said the following:</p>
<p>"...Whether there is a God or not, we do not know. Therefore, we have no right to educate children about things we do not know. Therefore, we do not educate about the afterlife; what we do teach children is to live in accordance with their principles, that is, to educate them on how to strive for socialism as adults..."</p>
<p>Since the SSS rejects the doctrines of the church, what do they use as their belief? Interestingly, they also use ten principles to replace the Ten Commandments of the church, which are stipulated to be recited by children every Sunday. Two of the ten principles are worth mentioning, namely:</p>
<p>"In order to discover the truth, one must observe and think, not believe in things that conflict with reason, and not deceive oneself or others."</p>
<p>"We are based on...justice...to help create a new society!"</p>
<p>It can be said directly that the education of the SSS is not to force children to bury themselves in socialist theories dogmatically, but to enable them to correctly understand everything through their own observation and understanding.</p>
<p>Regarding the principles of the SSS movement, many are indeed correct, but many are also trapped in a deep quagmire of humanitarianism. For example, at one SSS meeting, there was the following opinion:</p>
<p>"Love is more powerful than hatred. And a person wanting to shake another person's hand is more powerful than extending it in contempt. The most powerful thing in the world is where people have reverence. Therefore, people should revere mothers, fathers, children, the sympathy and mutual love of friends. The sympathy and mutual love of mothers, fathers, children, and friends is the ultimate powerful victory."</p>
<p>This theory not only violates the ten principles of the SSS, but also risks creating a new religion. This theory is clearly incorrect, because children's concept of "love" can be said to be innate, and the cultivation of this concept lies in the social environment. If we do not actively transform the social environment, but simply promote idealistic "love," it is useless. Under this capitalist social system, so-called "universal love" is just an empty and pleasant term; in fact, imperialism will never love weak nations, and exploiters will never love the exploited. Therefore, although we want to love our enemies and not hate them, it is both unreasonable and impossible!</p>

<h3>"The Question of Saving the Nation Through Music"</h3>
<p>— Shi Ru Yu</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, common "national salvation" proposals included "saving the nation by boycotting goods," "saving the nation through aviation," "saving the nation through education," "saving the nation through motors," "saving the nation through lottery tickets," and so on. There were also "saving the nation by dancing" and "saving the nation by civil war," simply too many to list. Now, some people are advocating "saving the nation through music." But to sum it up in one sentence, their original intentions are all patriotic. One gentleman, advocating "saving the nation through music," said this: "What kind of powerful stimulant is needed to save a nation mired in decline? To be honest, only 'music' can save China." He went on to say: "Indeed, we deeply feel that decadent and uninspired China is indeed lacking the infusion of art." Yes, we admit that China is indeed lacking the infusion of art, especially the common knowledge of "music" is even more childish. However, the reason why the Chinese nation has reached this state of decline and decadence is not merely because of a lack of artistic infusion, but there are even greater reasons, such as the misuse of terms like "enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens"...etc. Now, I would like to put forward a few points regarding the idea of "saving the nation through music" for discussion with everyone.</p>
<p>The emergence and development of every art form has its social background. For example, European and American countries are the most developed capitalist countries, coupled with the prosperity of science and the extreme attainment of material enjoyment, so their art is naturally advanced. However, despite the progress, it is undeniable that it remains an enjoyment for a minority of leisured people. As for colonial China, it goes without saying that it has been struggling and suffering from natural disasters, man-made disasters, foreign aggression, and civil wars for years. Most people cannot even secure their basic living needs, so how can they care about art that cannot feed the hungry or clothe the cold? Indeed, we need to look further afield and see what is the reason why the people of European and American countries are so lively and dignified? Is it because their music is particularly developed? I say, it is because their lives are relatively affluent and stable, hence their liveliness. The rich always seem dignified in the eyes of the poor. But let's look further afield, as a result of capitalism developing to its extreme, the whole world is in a great depression, making the poor increase day by day, and the situation is very different from before.</p>
<p>Speaking of the creation of art, the first condition is ample leisure time, followed by economic power. Please look at the 400 million people in China, how many are free from worries about food and clothing and have ample economic ability? That's just a few young masters and ladies from wealthy families. However, they spend their days hidden in an ivory tower, oblivious to the world, enjoying themselves, how would they know how many tens of thousands of subjugated slaves in the Northeast are being slaughtered by imperialists, and how many innocent people are being devoured by floods and droughts? But sometimes, when they are happy, when they are bored, they also want to find some opportunities to show off. I remember a few months ago, someone waved the banner of saving the nation through art and opened a painting exhibition. However, as a result, many paintings were sold, but the country was not saved. The facts are right in front of us, the position of Japanese imperialists in the Northeast is becoming more and more consolidated, and the most...again...are thinking about...This is hardly the time to be enjoying music?</p>
<p>The proponents of saving the nation through music say that Western violins and pianos are derived from Chinese musical instruments. Our national character, which is good at imitation but lacks creativity, has made us abandon national music and imitate Western music. Now, music (along with other arts) has become a pastime for a few people. However, aren't the cheap musical instruments of our own country also owned by a minority of the leisured class? Basically, a person who is oppressed by life will not spend money to buy musical instruments, and also has no time to study music.</p>
<p>We must know that the distress of groups of young men and women is definitely not just because they lack the comfort and stimulation of music. Aren't radios and gramophones all over the streets transmitting all kinds of songs? We have quite a few powerful stimulants! However, to a large group of unemployed, suffering children, hearing this kind of decadent commercial music will only increase their troubles and touch their sadness, because the wounds in their hearts can only be healed by work and bread. Then, perhaps only music like the French Marseillaise can move their cold hearts? However, what most of the people in France lack is bread, not music.</p>

<h3>Slum Workers' Train: Flesh Barrier</h3>
<p>— Zhang Cheng Liang</p>
<p>Train No. XX from S Port to N City. No first class, no second class, not even the usual third class. It's a bluish-gray, covered in coal ash, never washed, "slum workers' train"—such a long train, with a gloomy face, leaning lazily against platform X. A surging tide of people is agitated on the platform.</p>
<p>The engine is reluctantly panting in front, its nose pointing to the sky, its heart is hot, the blood is rushing. It will run away, as long as someone hits it on the head with a whip. Hit it with a whip, a whip, a whip... Damn it! Look at the railway police. They are standing at the ticket booth, blindly pushing people.</p>
<p>"Damn it, it's infuriating to buy a ticket, getting whipped. The guy at the ticket booth is even more arrogant, not accepting small silver coins, insisting on large silver dollars to make change, isn't he just trying to skim off the top! One dollar and thirty-five cents, gave him two silver dollars, only changed six small silver coins. Humph! Bullying the poor doesn't make you a hero."</p>
<p>"What are you fussing about? 'Spending money to get angry' is a common saying, there's no way around it if you want to ride his train."</p>
<p>The platform is extremely long, the train is extremely long, and people are surging like a tide. Thin yellow faces, bald heads and heads with long messy hair, not a single intact garment, not a hint of cheerful emotion, children lying on the backs of dirty women, crying and demanding to be squeezed to the front where their fathers are. The fathers, however, turn their faces back to scold the women: "So polite! Squeeze harder, can't you see? The train is packed."</p>
<p>Packed full, running towards the engine, there isn't a single carriage that's relatively empty. Dark heads swaying restlessly in the carriage windows. Puffs of roast duck smell, bursts of thick smoke that block the sunlight.</p>
<p>"Let's just get on this carriage!"</p>
<p>The carriage steps seem to be deliberately making things difficult for people, without any curvature. Hanging onto that iron bar to climb up, a careless step and you'll slip under the train, look at those single women, it's hard enough for them! It's even more dangerous with children—this is the "slum workers' train."</p>
<p>"Slum workers' train," you haven't seen the situation inside the carriage yet. The stench of fish and rot fills the air. Rotten, bloody legs without socks. Heads with external sores, dripping with pus. Anxious, expressionless faces of men and women, covered by a layer of coal smoke, covered by noisy conversations, here, everyone is being expelled from the city after suffering from the thorns of life. There is no cheerful emotion, no seeds of hope, and even less comfortable air, everything is deeply trapped in a sorrowful abyss.</p>
<p>However, looking out from the carriage window, the street scenes of the city are still joyous.</p>
<p>Four narrow hard benches, with four "flesh barriers" sitting on them. Those old women, women, and children who couldn't find seats later sat on the floor, their legs bumping into heads, their heads resting on legs, the toilet is also crowded with four or five people, a few young people have climbed onto the luggage racks, if it gets any more crowded, the carriage will break.</p>
<p>"Might as well break the carriage, at least let us get a breath of fresh air."</p>
<p>You know, there are only a few window holes in a slum workers' train, letting darkness accompany the stifling air. Some infectious germs are spreading in the stifling air. The smell of inferior cigarettes permeates the air. People who have been in prison would not feel any painful aversion here.</p>
<p>"Hey! Trying to die? Pig!" The railway police whipped the old man who was hanging on the carriage steps trying to relieve himself, and cursed him with this sentence, as the train was already crawling away.</p>

<h3>"Amateur" Without "Spare Time"</h3>
<p>— Qiu Jin Xian</p>
<p>Recently, the word "amateur" has become very popular. Because the "amateur" is all the rage, so there are many wonderful words, such as "amateur tutoring", "amateur sports", "amateur entertainment", countless, so anyone seems to be able to fully use the spare time to things that are beneficial to the body and mind. But, right on top of this, there have been some small problems: First, we must first understand whether every employee has "spare time" to use? Taking Shanghai as an example, apart from the "employees" of institutions, foreign firms, and modern shops, there is no so-called "spare time" at all, and employees without "spare time" probably account for more than 70% of all employees in the city. These employees who do not have "spare time" happen to be knowledge-hungry. Their work and life, taking shop assistants as an example, generally start from 7:00 in the morning and continue to work until 9:00 or 10:00 in the evening. Within this twelve or thirteen hours of working time, apart from those times when they can sit down for a moment to eat (if there are no customers), it is best to keep their hands and feet moving all day long. Even if there are no customers, they must use a feather duster to wipe and dust, to show diligence, lest the employer ask you to "seek a better position elsewhere". Therefore, even when they need to relieve themselves, they have to hurry up, let alone hold books and newspapers to study. By the time they put up the shutters at nine or ten o'clock, they are already so tired that they don't know what they are doing, and they practice their "amateur sleep", who still has the energy to engage in "tutoring", "sports", "entertainment",...etc.?</p>
<p>Taking workers as an example, their lives are even worse than shop assistants. They enter the factory at six o'clock in the morning, fight the man-eating machines until six or seven o'clock in the evening, go home with their heads drooping and their spirits down, and have to "bury the pot and make rice" to fill their five internal organs temple. They leave the cold rice for tomorrow to take into the factory, and fill half their stomach with the leftovers. Then, they peel off the dirty clothes that are so dirty that they don't know what they are and are full of the smell of machine oil, and wash them vigorously. After finishing this work, it can naturally be regarded as "spare time", but if they delay for a while to do some "tutoring", "sports", "entertainment",... they will surely hear echoes in the factory tomorrow, you are still snoring, and you have lost a day's work, and you are going hungry for a day.</p>
<p>Therefore, the so-called "spare time" is still something that only employees in the middle and upper levels have the right to enjoy. The more urgently the lower-level employees need to use their spare time to increase their knowledge and health, the more they can only stand at the bottom of hell, cran their necks, and wait for the bosses to automatically improve the unreasonable treatment of their young partners and workers under their rule when the sun rises in the west.</p>
<p>Now let's study the middle and upper-level employees who have the right to enjoy "spare time". Taking myself as an example, although my working hours are only six hours between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM, but when I get up early, I have to take care of the children, let my wife go to buy groceries, and after lunch, I have to take care of the children again, let my wife tidy things up, and after finishing my official duties in the afternoon, I have to take care of the children again, let my wife do the laundry. After eating dinner, I have to write some articles to exchange for some money to supplement the household expenses. Naturally, my life cannot represent the average person, but undoubtedly, there must be many employees in the same layer as me who live the same life as me,——although they have "spare time", but in fact, there is no opportunity to use it to temper their body and mind.</p>
<p>From this, we can find a conclusion, all "amateur" sports, shop assistants in old-style shops, workers selling labor, although they have spare time, are unable to enjoy it because they are plagued by poverty and family burdens. In fact, the lowest level of people who can fully use their spare time for "amateur XX" are still the people in the petty bourgeoisie, and the children of the people in the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Under the deformed social and economic organization, such a deformed product is naturally inevitable. But culture is progressing with the giant wheels of the times, and I always hope that in the near future, there will no longer be anyone in this world who is a "spare time" outsider.</p>
